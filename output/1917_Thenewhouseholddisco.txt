PREFACE 

In an address to his fellow-countrymen on April 16, 1917, President 
Wilson said : " Let me suggest . . . that every housewife who prac- 
tices strict economy puts herself in the ranks of those who serve the 
nation. This is the time for America to correct her unpardonable 
fault of wastefulness and extravagance." 

Before anyone can respond efficiently to this appeal two things are 
necessary. One must understand in what respects American housekeep- 
ing is wasteful and extravagant; and one must learn by what means 
these faults can be corrected. Such are the objects of this book, 
namely, to show American housekeepers how they can economize in 
foods, in fabrics, in prevention of disease, in time, and in labor — each 
and all of which are equivalent to direct economy of money. 

Nearly every woman, when she marries and begins housekeeping, 
copies into a scrapbook the favorite recipes that have been handed down 
in her immediate family from mother to daughter for generations. And 
through life she continues adding from time to time the favorite recipes 
of others to her collection. Household suggestions of this character are 
perhaps the most practical and economical of any, because they are be- 
ing subjected daily to the test of actual experience. Such is the nature 
of this book ; for its original basis consists in some fifty thousand labor- 
saving and money-saving ideas contributed to a popular magazine by 
practical housekeepers. 

In addition, the editor has laid under contribution every important 
book of household recipes previously published in the English language 
(over fifty in all), as well as the rich literature of household suggestions 
resulting from scientific research. For many costly investigations have 
been conducted during recent years in college and university labora- 
tories, and in the experiment stations of the several states and of the 
nation, the results of which have been made available in countless re- 
ports and bulletins, as well as in the newspapers and popular mag- 
azines. From all these sources were gathered more than one hundred 
thousand separate recipes and suggestions, and the present volume con- 
tains the cream of them all. 

The combination thus effected of money-saving and labor-saving sug- 
gestions of practical housekeepers, with the conclusions of scientific in- 
vestigators, is believed to be unique. And by the explanation in popu- 
lar language thus afforded of the scientific principles at bottom of the 
recipes and processes recommended, this book, in the opinion of authori- 
ties, has taken a long step in advance of its predecessors. Having been 
based upon contributions from practical housekeepers, it was designed 
expressly for the home-maker and, at its inception, no thouglit was 
entertained that it would be of interest or value to teachers of domestic 
economy for use in schools. Hence the very cordial reception accorded 



PREFACE 

it by educators, and its general adoption as a text book and work of 
reference in schools and libraries throughout the United States, have 
occasioned both editor and publisher surprise as well as gratification. 

In the several revisions of this work the editor has freely availed 
himself of both practical and scientific information — if adapted in form 
to popular use — wherever found. Hence — in addition to the general 
acknowledgment due the many thousands of housekeepers and others 
who have contributed favorite family recipes — the following special 
obligations are gratefully acknowledged: To E. H. S. Bailey, Pli.D., 
of the Kansas State Board of Health, and Bigelow & Howard of the 
United States Dei^artment of Agriculture, Bureau of Chemistry, for 
tests for detecting adulterants in foods ; to M. Edouard Panchard, man- 
aging chef of the Hotel McAlpin, the Hotel Claridge, and Cafe Savarin 
of New York, and the Trouville, Long Beach, for the article on Cater- 
ing, Cooking and Carving; to C. F. Langworthy, Ph.D., and Caroline L. 
Hunt, A.B., for articles on the economical use of meat and cheese; to 
Maria Parloa for the article on the preparation of vegetables for the 
table; to Isabel Gordon Curtis, formerly editor of Good Housekeeping 
Magazine, and autlior of " Lcft-Overs Made Palatable," " The Every- 
day Cookbook," " The Making of a Housewife," and " The Progress of 
a Housekeeper," for the bulk of the cookery recipes comprised in Chap- 
ters VII to XV and XVIII to XXXII, inclusive, and also for the ar- 
ticle, " Wliat tlie Home Nurse Ought to Do " ; to the Public Health 
authorities of the principal cities of the United States, and the several 
States of the nation, for material on the prevention of disease and care 
of babies comprised in Chapter .XXXVIII to XLI, inclusive; to Dr. 
George J. Fisher of the International Y. M. C, A. for the article on 
" First Aid to the Injured "; and to sundry other authorities too numer- 
ous to mention. 

Already upward of a million copies of Household Discoveries have 
been distributed, and there is abundant evidence that the American 
people regard the millions of dollars paid for them not as an expense, 
but as an investment. For the keynote of the letters of endorsement 
received by the publishers is economy. Multitudes have said that by 
the use of a single recipe they have saved as much or more than the cost 
to them of the entire volume. Indeed, it would be difficult to over-es- 
timate the possibilities of saving in time, in money, and in human suf- 
fering that would result if every family in the land should observe the 
teachings on Diet, on Laundering and Dry-cleaning, on the Care of In- 
fants, and on the Prevention of Communicable Disease, approved by 
the leading authorities and set forth in these pages. It is believed that 
no volume before the American people is better calculated to enable its 
owners to effect needful economies, and that no service could be more 
patriotic than to promote to the utmost possible extent its distribution 
and use.

The choice, preparation, service and 
care of food are topics of vital im- 
portance in every home. Until quite 
recently experience — as represented 
by the traditions of the best house- 
keepers — has been about the only 
source of information on these sub- 
jects. And such experience is still 
in many respects the best and safest 
guide. But of late a great many 
scientific investigations as to food 
values and adulterations have been 
made — notably under the direction 
of the United States Department of 
Agriculture — and very practical re- 
sults have been secured. The most 
essential facts and principles are here 
condensed for ready reference. In 
many respects the result of scientific 
study has been to confirm popular 
impressions derived from everyday 
experience. Yet it has been shown 
that certain very widespread beliefs 
are wholly groundless. All the con- 
clusions here stated have been 
abundantly confirmed by practical 
experiments and may be accepted 
without hesitation. Such knowledge 
is valuable because it dispels doubt 
and uncertainty. It confirms good 
practices. It also draws attention to 



17 



mistakes and shows how they may be 
corrected. 



HUMAN NUTRITION 

The human body has often been 
likened to a steam engine in which 
the food we eat takes the part of 
fuel. This comparison is partly true 
but is inadequate. A steam engine 
gradually wears out with use. Then 
the worn or broken parts must be re- 
placed from some source without 
itself. The human body also wears 
away, but — unlike the steam engine 
— it has the power of rebuilding its 
own parts from the fuel (food) 
which it consumes. It can also bring 
about certain chemical changes where- 
by its fuel (food) is converted into 
new forms either for immediate use 
or for storage within the body 
against future needs. Hence the 
value of food depends in part upon 
its capacity to produce needed heat 
and energj--, and in part upon its 
capacity to supply material for 
growth and repair of bodily waste. 

Food Wastes. — The relation be- 
tween the cost of food and its actual 
value to supply bodily needs is af- 



18 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



fected by at least three diiferent 
kinds of wastes. These differ greatly 
in different kinds of food. They are 
among the things which should be 
most jealously watched and studied 
by the housewife. There is consider- 
able loss between some kinds of foods 
as j)urchascd and as cooked or served. 
Familiar examples are the shells of 
eggs, skins and seeds of fruit and 
vegetables, bones and offal of meat, 
bran of cereals and the like. These 
are commonly known as refuse. 
Some are of no value since they are 
wholly indigestible (for example egg 
shells). Others may be utilized in 
various ways as meat bones, which 
may be used for soup stock. 

A second kind of waste is that 
caused by cooking. This is less im- 
portant since, in most cases, it can- 
not be helped. But with some of the 
more expensive kinds of food, the 
choice among methods of cookery 
may be affected by the fact that 
some ways are more economical than 
others. 

A third waste is due to the fact 
that a part of the food actually eaten 
is not taken up into the lymph and 
blood channels but passes through the 
digestive tract and is excreted from 
the body. This is said not to be 
" available " to digestion. 

The net product which finally gets 
into the blood is called nutritive ma- 
terial, or nutrients. 

Nutrients in Food. — Formerly a 
great many scientific terms were 
used in discussing the nutritive value 
of foods. This made the subject un- 
interesting to most persons because 
difficult to understand. With the in- 
crease of popular interest, efforts 
were made to simplify the language 
of science. It was found that all nu- 
trients may be classed under five 
heads and referred to by means of 
terms, all but two of which are in 
every-day use. These unusual terms 
are " proteid " and " carbohydrate." 
Of these the former is indispensable. 
There is no other word which can 
take its place. It refers to that part 
of foods which contains (among 
other things) the element nitrogen. 
These include, chiefly, the lean of 
meat; the gluten of wheat and other 



cereals; the curd (casein) of milk; 
and the white (albumen) of eggs. 
The two words sugar and starch can 
be used in place of the term " car- 
bohydrate " as the word refers chiefly 
to these two substances. These and 
other carbohydrates are so called be- 
cause the}' contain the element hydro- 
gen in the same proportions in which 
it occurs in water but combined with 
the element carbon; hence the name. 
Good examples of carbohydrates are 
potato or corn starch, and cane, 
grape, or milk sugar. 

The names of the other three 
classes of nutrients are in common 
use. These are water, fat and ash. 
Water occurs in varying percentages 
in nearly all foods, even those which 
we are accustomed to think of as en- 
tirely dry, such as wheat and other 
dry grains, or dried peas and beans. 
Common examples of fat are lard, 
suet, butter and olive oil. The ash 
in foods consists of various kinds of 
mineral matter which are left as a 
residue when the foods are burned. 
The only kind of mineral matter 
usually added to foods in cookery is 
common salt. 

In addition to these five kinds of 
nutrients, there is another class of 
substances in food which is of some 
value in cookery, although it is not 
believed that they furnish fuel or 
contribute to the growth of bodily 
tissue. They are called " extrac- 
tives." They include various volatile 
oils and similar flavors which are 
" extracted " from foods in the proc- 
ess of cookery, whence the name. 
They give to certain foods the char- 
acteristic taste and odor which 
" make the mouth water." They aid 
digestion by stimulating the palate 
and prompting the flow of the saliva, 
gastric juice and other secretions 
which are necessary to good diges- 
tion. An example is the well known 
meat extract used for bouillon. This 
is not a food but merely an appetiz- 
ing condiment. 

Interest in the subject of food val- 
ues centers in the three classes of nu- 
trients — proteid, carbohydrate, and 
fat. Water is plentiful in every diet 
and is usually taken freely to satisfy 
thirst. Ash or mineral matter rep-

resents only about 1 per cent of most 
foods and is thought to be abundant 
in the ordinary diet. It is most 
plentiful in the natural food of the 
young, as in milk and eggs, and is of 
special importance to furnish ma- 
terial for bony structures during the 
period of growth and also in some 
diseased conditions. The housekeep- 
er's problem is thus narrowed to the 
supply of sufficient proteid, carbohy- 
drate and fat in the right propor- 
tions, as cheaply as possible, and in 
readily available, that is easily diges- 
tible, forms. 

Uses of Nutrients in the Body. — 
The three principal classes of nutri- 
ents, — proteid fat and carbohydrate, 
all serve as fuel to yield energy in 
the forms of heat and muscular 
power. But the chief source of fuel 
is fat. Hence the Eskimo eats freely 
of tallow and blubber to keep up the 
bodily heat in winter. Any excess 
of fat may be stored in the body 
against future needs. Thus the bear 
lives on his fat during his long win- 
ter's sleep, and comes out lean in 
the spring. The carbohydrates — 
sugar and starch — may be immedi- 
ately consumed as fuel, or they may 
be converted into and stored as fat. 
The proteids may also be consumed 
as fuel. But this does not ordinarily 
happen unless there is a deficiency of 
fat and carbohydrate in the diet. 
The normal use of proteid is in the 
growth and repair of the bodily tis- 
sues. The importance of this class of 
nutrients in food is due to the fact 
that none of the others can take its 
place. This explains why an infant 
fed wholly on condensed milk — which 
is rich in sugar and fat, but deficient 
in proteid (curds), may be fat but 
not strong. Roughly speaking, fat 
and carbohydrate supply heat and 
energy, and proteid forms tissue. 
This broad distinction is very serv- 
iceable and should be kept clearly in 
mind. 

DIETARY STANDARDS 

Balanced Diet. — A diet is said to 
be balanced when it contains avail- 
able proteid, carbohydrate and fat in 
the right proportions. A great many 



experiments have been made to de- 
termine the ratio which the different 
classes of nutrients should sustain to 
one another in human food. In 
American publications the conclu- 
sions of Atwater and Chittenden are 
most often taken as standards. The 
Atwater standard, for a man with 
light exercise, is 100 parts (by 
weight) of proteid, 100 parts of fat 
and 360 parts of carbohydrate. The 
Chittenden standard is that for every 
100 food units about 10 should be 
proteid, 30 fat, and 60 carbohydrate. 
These figures are interesting chiefly 
as showing that there can be no xmi- 
versal rule of proportion fixed by sci- 
ence. So-called standards are merely 
attempts to arrive at a general aver- 
age on the basis of experience. In 
practice it will be sufficient if each 
of the principal nutrients is present 
in the dietary in sufficient quantities 
and without marked excess or de- 
ficiency of either. If this is the case 
the normal appetite will ordinarily 
select a well balanced diet. 

The Graphic Method of Diet Cal- 
culations. — Prof. Irving Fisher has 
devised a method of making " food 
maps " which show the proportions of 
proteid, fat, and carbohydrate in 
graphic form. He says : " Any food 
is represented on the food map by 
a point the relative distance of which 
from the three sides of the triangle 
represents the proteid, fat and carbo- 
hydrate. Fatty foods are represent- 
ed by points near the fat corner, F; 
starchy and sugary foods by points 
near the carbohydrate corner, C; and 
proteids by a point near the proteid 
corner, P. A food devoid of proteid 
is evidently located on the base line 
CF. A food devoid of fat on the 
side, CP, and a food devoid of car- 
bohydrates on FP. . . . In each case 
the position of the point relative to 
the sides of the triangle represents 
the proportions of proteid, fat and 
carbohydrate and the number op- 
posite each name represents the 
weight in ounces of a 'standard por- 
tion.' " 

The accompanying food maps pre- 
pared by Dr. Fisher are a much 
more convenient means of comparing 
the values of different foods than

tables of percentages. If carefully 
studied they will be found to con- 
tain about as much information as 
most persons would be apt to need

or use. Roughly speaking, a bal- 
anced ration should contain one or 
more foods from each of the three 
corners of this triangle. To take an 
extreme illustration, butter, white of 



egg and sugar combined in standard 
proportions — if such a combination 
were possible in cookery — would give 
an example of a well balanced ration 
because they consist of almost pure 
fat, proteid and carbohydrate respec- 
tively. Or, a food located near either 
corner of the triangle may be bal- 
anced by one which is about equi- 
distance between the opposite corners. 
The food map " Flesh and Cereals " 
affords many good illustrations of 
this principle. The different kinds 
of flesh are seen to contain both fat 
and proteid, but practically no starch 
or sugar. But the cereals are nearly 
all carbohydrate. For example, beef 
tongue and brown bread make a well 
balanced ration. Observe that brown 
bread is shown by the food map to 
be near the carbohydrate corner. Its 
food values are practically all sugar 
or starch. Beef tongue is about half 
way between the fat and proteid cor- 
ners. Its food values are about 
equally divided between these two 
kinds of nutrients.

triangle show absence or marked de- 
ficiency of the kind of nutrient rep- 
resented at the opposite corner. 
Those at or near one of the corners 
show absence or deficiency of the 
kinds of nutrients represented at 
both the opposite corners. The foods 
appearing at or near the center of 
the triangle contain each of the three 
classes of nutrients and, according 
to their position, afford a naturally 
more or less well balanced ration. 

By reference to the standards given 
on page 19 it will be seen that the 
body requires, according to Chitten- 
den, about one part proteid to three 
parts fat and six parts carbohydrate. 
Hence foods constituting a naturally 




culating food values, a unit which he 
calls the " standard portion." This 
is a quantity of each kind of food 
which will produce 100 calories of 
energy. The " calory " is the unit of 
measurement of heat, just as the 
pound is the unit of weight, or the 
acre the unit of land measure. A 
calory is approximately the amount 
of heat that is required to raise the 
temperature of one pound of water 
4° F. The figures after the names 
on the food maps give the weight of 
" standard portions " in ounces. They 
are useful as a means of comparing 
the values of different kinds of 
foods, since the value of food to the 
body is determined by the number of 
calories of heat or energy that it 
can produce. Referring to the food 
map " Flesh and Cereals," for exam- 
ple, it will be seen that l^o 
ounces of white bread are the equiva- 
lent of 3 %o ounces of round of 
beef (uncooked), and many other in- 
teresting comparisons are suggested. 
A few words about each of the prin- 
cipal kinds of nutrients and a brief 
discussion of each of the chief classes 
of food from which they may be ob- 
tained — with the aid of the food 
maps for purposes of comparison — 
will enable any housewife to provide 
a reasonably well balanced diet.

Water. — Water makes up a very 
large part of many kinds of food, 
such as milk, fresh meat, and fresh 
fruits and vegetables. It is present 
in practically all food products. 
Roughly speaking, over one-half of 
fresh lean meat and fish, and about 
three-fourths of fresh fruit and veg- 
etables are water. It forms over 60 
per cent by weight of the average 
human body and is a component part 
of all the tissues. It is thus an im- 
portant constituent of our food. But 
it cannot be burned and hence does 
not yield energy to the body. For 
this reason the water contained in 
foods is usually set aside together 
with the refuse and nutrients not 
available to digestion. Only the 
values of the digestible solids need be 
calculated. To the housewife, the 



22 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



presence of water in foods is of im- 
portance chleHy in comparison of 
cost by weight. Oysters, for exam- 
ple, are an expensive food as com- 
pared to sirloin of beef at the same 
price per pound, since they contain 
36 per cent more water. In other 
words, watery foods are dilute and 



by weight. It is found principally in 
the bones and teeth. It is, however, 
present in other tissues and in solu- 
tion in the various fluids. Mineral 
matter yields little or no energy, yet 
is indispensable to life and health. 
The average of mineral matter in the 
various kinds of food is not far from

bulky and nmst be ])aid for and eaten 
in far larger quantities to yield an 
equal amount of nutriment. 

Mineral Matter or Ash. — When 
food or body material is burned, a 
small residue of mineral matter re- 
mains as ash. This constitutes some 
5 per cent or G per cent of the body 



1 per cent, but tiie proportion ranges 
to over -2 per cent in some cereals. It 
is most plentiful in the hulls (as the 
bran of wheat found in whole wheat 
flour) and in dried legumes (peas and 
beans); these contain about 4 per 
cent of mineral matter. Fresh vege- 
tables, especially lettuce, are esteemed

— especially in certain kinds of dis- 
eases — for tiie mineral salts they con- 
tain. 

Proteid. — The proteid compounds 
form about 18 per cent by weiglit of 
the average human body. They in- 
clude the white of egg, the lean of 
meat, the curd of milk and the gluten 
of wheat. They also occur to some 
extent in animals in the tendons, skin 
and bones. They are most important 
constituents of our food since they 
make the basis of bone, muscle and 
other tissues. They may also be used 
as fuel or even, to some extent, trans- 
formed into fat and stored in the 
body, especially if there is a defi- 
ciency of fats or carbohydrates. 
The chief sources of proteid are 
animal foods — • meat, fish, eggs and 
dairy products. Butter and lard are 
exceptions; they represent only the 
fat of milk and meat. 

The projiortion of proteid present 
in meats and fish varies greatly with 
the kind and cut. In beef, veal, and 
mutton it composes between 14 and 
26 per cent of the edible portion. It 
is somewhat less abundant in the 
flesh of fish, because the latter is 
more watery than meat. The fatter 
the meat, the smaller is the propor- 
tion of proteid. Lean pork has less 
than beef and mutton, and fat pork 
almost none. It is very abundant in 
cheese (28-38 per cent) and likewise 
in dried beans and peas (18-25 per 
cent). Proteid makes up, roughly 
speaking, from 7 to 15 per cent of 
the cereals, being least abundant in 
rye and buckwheat and most abund- 
ant in oats. Wheat flour averages 
not far from 11 per cent and bread 
not far from 9 per cent of proteid. 
Fresh vegetables and fruits contain 
almost no proteid, seldom if ever 
more than 5 and often only 1 per 
cent or less. 

Fats. — These form about 15 per 
cent by weight of the body of an av- 
erage man, but the amount varies 
greatly with food, exercise, age and 
other conditions. As a general rule 
any excess of the diet tends to be con- 
verted into fat and stored in the 
body. But the tendency to fatness 
or leanness cannot be controlled by 
the diet alone. It depends also on 



individual peculiarities which are not 
well understood. Fats occur chiefly 
in animal foods, as meat and dairy 
products. They are also abundant in 
some vegetable products, such as 
olives and cottonseed. From these 
they are expressed as oil. They occur 
to a less extent in some cereals, as 
oatmeal and corn, and also in all 
common edible nuts. 

Fats may be stored in various parts 
of the body in masses, or may be 
scattered through the tissues in mi- 
nute particles. The quantities pres- 
ent in meat vary from less than 10 per 
cent in some cuts of beef and veal, to 
over 40 per cent in a side of pork, or 
over 80 per cent in fat salt pork. 
Lean fish, like cod and haddock, con- 
tains a small amount, but fatter 
kinds, like shad, mackerel, and nota- 
bly salmon, often contain from 5 per 
cent to 10 per cent and sometimes as 
high as 15 per cent of fat. The chem- 
ical composition of salmon is not un- 
like that of lean meat. Milk averages 
about 4 per cent of fat. Butter is 
nearly pure fat, and cheese contains 
from 25 per cent to 40 per cent of fat, 
according to the richness of the cream 
or milk from which it is made. Vege- 
table foods are as a rule very defi- 
cient in fats. The principal excep- 
tions have been noted. 

Carbohydrates. — The carbohy- 
drates form only a very small part 
of the body, less than 1 per cent. 
They are either immediately con- 
sumed as fuel or transformed in the 
body as fat. They include such com- 
pounds as starches, different kinds of 
sugar and the fiber of plants or cellu- 
lose. They are very abundant in veg- 
etable foods like cereals, green vege- 
tables and potatoes, but unlike the 
fats, are almost entirely absent from 
the animal foods except milk. Car- 
bohydrates make up from 70 per cent 
to 80 per cent of the cereals, 60 per 
cent to 70 per cent of the dry legumes 
(peas and beans) and the biilk of the 
nutrients of fresh fruits and vege- 
tables. Sugar, molasses, honey and 
the like are almost entirely carbo- 
hydrates. Milk also contains a con- 
siderable amount of carbohydrates in 
the form of milk sugar. They are a 
very important portion of the diet, 



24-

because they are an excellent source 
of energy and are easily digested. 

Atwater says: 

*' In brief then, the chief source of 
proti'id is animal foods, legumes and 
cereals; of fats, animal foods; and 
of carbohydrates, vegetable products 
and milk. Mineral matters are 
found in all food materials. Refuse 
and water are most abundant in 
meats, fish, eggs, milk, fresh vegeta- 
bles and fruit. The fuel value varies 
within wide limits, being greatest in 
those materials which contain the 
most fat and the least water. 

" The ingredients of food and the 
ways they are used in the body may 
be briefly summarized in the follow- 
ing schematic manner: 



moved at will. Beaumont's table 
giving the average time required for 
the stomach to digest various articles 
of diet has been frequently pub- 
lished. More recent experiments show 
that his conclusions are by no means 
a safe guide. The process of diges- 
tion is not confined to the stomach. 
It continues in the intestine. The di- 
gestibility of foods is also affected 
by the quantity taken, its mechanical 
condition, and other causes. 

As a general rule the less atten- 
tion given by housewives to this ques- 
tion the better. Recent experiments 
seem to indicate that all well-cooked 
ordinary foods are about equally well 
digested by normally healthy persons.

PROBLEMS OF THE DIET 

Digestibility. — Many experiments 
have been made to learn the com- 
parative value of different kinds of 
food as aff"ected by their digestibil- 
ity and by various processes of cook- 
ery. Some of the earliest and most 
famous of these were made by Dr. 
Win. Beaumont, U. S. A., between 
18J5-3.3. His subject was a French- 
Canadian trapi)er, a man whose stom-

that some kinds of foods do not

this is a matter which does not admit 
of general rules. It can be settled 
in each case only on the basis of ex- 
perience. Each person must learn 
what kinds of food yield him nourish- 
ment with the least discomfort and 
must avoid those which do not agree

cooked foods is often grossly exag- 
gerated. The ordinary mixed diet 
has been shown by scientific tests to 
be by far the most wholesome and 
economical. As general rules, how- 
ever, it may be said that carbohy- 
drates — especially in the form of 
sugar — are more completely digested 
than proteids and fats; and that the 
proteid of animal foods — as meat, 
fish, milk and eggs — is more digesti- 
ble than that of vegetable foods. 

Economy in Diet. — The needs of 
individuals differ, but it has been 
estimated that an average man at 
moderately active labor — as a farm- 
er, carpenter or mason — should have 
about one-fourth of a pound of avail- 
able proteid each day, and suflficient 
fats and carbohydrates, in addition, 
to bring the total fuel value of the 
whole diet up to about 3000 calories. 
A man at sedentary employment 
would require only one-fifth of a 
pound of proteid, and other nutrients 
enough to produce a total of only 
2700 calories of energy. A woman 
under similar conditions would need 
about eight-tenths as much food as 
a man. Children require lesser 
amounts, varying with their ages. 
The proportions usually stated are 
about seven-tenths for a boy from 
the ages of 1;? to 14; six-tenths from 
10 to 13; five-tenths from 6 to 9, and 
four-tenths from 2 to 5 years of age. 
Girls require slightly less nutrient 
than boys of the same age, but in 
practice the difference is negligible. 

The cost of the amounts of differ- 
ent nutrients required varies greatly 
with the different kinds of food at 
ordinary prices. For example, one- 
fourth of a pound of proteid from a 
sirloin of beef at 25 cents a pound 
would cost 40 cents. The same 
amount from a shoulder clod of beef 
at 12 cents a pound would cost 19 
cents, and from a i)iece of beef stew 
meat at 5 cents a pound only 9 cents; 
yet the actual value of each in the 
diet would be identical. The table on 
the next page of the comparative cost 
of digestible nutrients and energy in 
different food materials at average 
prices, prepared by the Department 
of Agriculture, is very useful and 
suggests many similar comparisons. 



The most common errors in food 
economy are (1) the needless waste 
of expensive foods, (2) the use of a 
one-sided diet, (3) waste of food 
from over-eating, (4) table waste, 
and (5) neglect of the value of 
refuse. Many housekeepers buy the 
more expensive kinds of meat and 
pay higher prices for vegetables and 
eggs out of season, from a mistaken 
belief that such foods are enough 
more nutritious to be worth what 
they cost. In point of fact equal 
amounts of nutriment could be ob- 
tained from other foods at very much 
lower price. The result is a great 
waste of money. The maxim that 
" the best is the cheapest," as pop- 
ularly understood to apply to high 
prices, is not true of food. The 
larger part of the price of the cost- 
lier foods is paid for appearance, 
flavor or rarity. While often more 
pleasing to the palate and sometimes 
more easily cooked or of finer flavor, 
the dearer articles are no more di- 
gestible or nutritious than the cheap- 
er ones. The plain, substantial stand- 
ard food materials — like the cheaper 
cuts of meat and fish, milk, flour, 
cornmeal, oatmeal, beans and pota- 
toes — are as digestible and nutri- 
tious and as well fitted for the nour- 
ishment of persons in good health 
as are any of the costly materials. 

A one-sided or badly balanced diet 
is one in which either proteid or fuel 
ingredients arc in excess. If we eat 
too much meat and too few vegeta- 
bles, the diet will be too rich in pro- 
teid and may be harmful. Or, if we 
eat too much pastry and other food 
rich in fats and sweets, the diet fur- 
nishes too much energy and too lit- 
tle building material. The result is 
injurious to health as well as false 
economy. Waste from over-eating is 
perhaps not common except among 
persons of sedentary occupations — 
brain workers, as distinguished from 
hand workers — but table waste is al- 
most universal in America. In many 
families it is a matter of pride to 
furnish more food than is needed. 
The waste in the preparation of food 
materials for consumption is also 
considerable. This is especially the 
case with animal foods which are the

(J The cost of 1 pound of proteid means the cost of enough of the given material to fur- 
nish 1 pound of proteid, without regard to the amounts of the other nutrients present. 
Likewise the cost of energy means the cost of enough material to furnish 1,000 calories 
without reference to the kinds and proportions of nutrients in which the energy is sup- 
plied. Thesc_ estimates of the cost of proteid and energy are thus incorrect in that neither 



g:ives credit for the value of the other.

FOOD VALUES AND ADULTERATIONS

most expensive. The trimmings of 
meat left with the butcher or thrown 
away in the kitchen often represent 
one-eighth of its value. Much of this 
might be saved by its use in soups, 
stews and the like. But persons who 
wish to get the most nutriment for 
their money should avoid such cuts as 
loin of beef, rib chops of lamb, and 
others, one-fifth or more of which are 
bone, and buy more economical cuts 
in which there is less waste. The 
common remark that " the average 
American family wastes as much food 
as a French family would live upon" 
is greatly exaggerated. Yet it con- 
tains considerable truth. Tests have 
shown that the waste in private fam- 
ilies is often as high as twenty per 
cent. A study of the information 
here given is important for both 
health and purse. 

MEATS IN THE DIET 

Reference to the food map will 
show that the nutritive part of meat 
contains no carbohydrate but con- 
sists of proteid and fat in varying 
proportions. It is possible to live on 
animal food alone. And this is done 
in the arctic regions where vegeta- 
ble food is lacking. But the diet is 
better and more wholesome if the 
proteid and fat of meat are balanced 
by the sugar and starch contained 
in vegetables. Meat is an expensive 
source of proteid as compared to 
some foods of vegetable origin, but 
is to be preferred upon the ground 
that it is more easily digested. 
Meats are more similar in composi- 
tion to the tissues of the human body 
than foods of vegetable origin. Hence 
they require less change in the body 
to make them available to digestion. 

A comparison of the nutrients in 
the different cuts of meat shows that 
they vary chiefly in the amounts of 
fat and water which they contain, 
but that there is very little difference 
in the proportion of proteid. Lang- 
worthy says, in substance, that for 
every day purposes the proportion 
and net value of the proteid obtained 
from a given weight of meat differs 
very little either with the kind of 
meat or the cut, with the exception 



of fat salt pork or bacon. This 
makes it easy for the housekeeper to 
be sure that her family is getting 
enough of this nutrient. 

The total amount of proteid needed 
each day for a man at moderate la- 
bor is estimated at 3J ounces. Of 
this, one-half is usually taken in the 
form of animal food, including milk, 
eggs, poultry and fish, as well as 
meat. The remainder is taken in the 
form of bread and other cereal foods, 
or beans and other vegetables. An 
ordinary helping of three to five 
ounces of lean meat may be consid- 
ered to contain about one-half of the 
required proteid. An egg or a glass 
of milk contains about one-twelfth 
of the needed daily supply. Hence 
the housekeeper who gives each adult 
member of her family a helping of 
three to five ounces of cooked meat 
each day with eggs, milk or cheese — 
together with puddings or other 
dishes which contain eggs or milk — 
can feel sure that she is supplying 
sufficient proteid. The remainder 
necessary will be supplied by bread, 
cereals and other vegetable foods. 

Langworthy says further, that 
there is practically no difference be- 
tween the various cuts of meat, or 
the meats from different animals, 
with respect to either the thorough- 
ness or the ease with which they are 
digested. Red meat is equally as di- 
gestible as white meat, pork is as di- 
gestible as beef, and the cheaper 
cuts are equally as digestible as the 
tenderest steak. Meats of all kinds 
and cuts are therefore to be classed 
as easily digested foods. Those who 
wish to use the chea])er cuts need 
not feel that, in so doing, their fam- 
ilies are less well nourished than by 
the more expensive meats. It is, how- 
ever, true that some kinds of meat 
— as roast chicken, or veal, tender- 
loin of steak and lamb chops cooked 
rare — are tender, easily masticated, 
well flavored and appetizing. Hence 
so far as stomach or gastric digestion 
is concerned, they are somewhat more 
easily and rapidly digested than 
others. In other words, they pass 
quickly out of the stomach and into 
the intestine where the principal work 
of digestion actually takes place. 



28 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



This agrees with the practice of using 
so-called white meats in diets for the 
sick room. It remains true, however, 
that nearly all of the proteid and 
about 95 per cent of the fat of all 
sorts of meat are digested by the 
average person. 

Cuts of Meat. — The method of cut- 
ting sides of beef, veal, mutton and 
pork into parts for sale, and the 
terms used for the different " cuts " 
as these parts are commonly called, 
vary in different locahties. The 
standard adopted by the U. S. De- 
partment of Agriculture is shown in 
the accompanying illustrations both 
for the live animal and the dressed 
carcass. Elsewhere the principal cuts 
are illustrated as they appear on the 
butcher's table. Both the lines of the 
different cuts and the names vary 
more or less in different parts of the 
country. The best way to learn the 
cuts of meat, as sold in your local 
market, is to ask the butcher to allow 
you to watch him cut up one or more 
sides of the different kinds of meat. 
Ask him to give you the names of 
the parts and also to give you his 
own ideas concerning them. In this 
way a great deal of valuable infor- 
mation can be obtained. Too many 
housekeepers are in the habit of buy- 
ing only two or three of the highest 
priced cuts of meat. They do not 
realize that by proper methods of 
cookery equally as much nutriment 
can be obtained from cheaper cuts 
at from one-half to one-tenth the 
cost. The characteristics of the dif- 
ferent cuts are described by Woods, 
in substance, as follows: 

Cuts of Beef. — The diagram shows 
the general method of cutting up a 
side of beef. The neck piece is some- 
times cut so as to include more of 
the chuck than is here shown. The 
shoulder clod is usually cut without 
bone, and hence is an economical 
cut, being free from refuse. The 
shoulder (not indicated in the dia- 
gram) includes more br less of the 
shoulder blade and the upper end of 
the foreshank. Shoulder steak is cut 
from the chuck. The blade is some- 
times made to include all the parts 
of the forequarter here shown as 
brisket, cross ribs, blade and navel. 



The different portions of the blade 
as thus cut are then spoken of as 
the " brisket " end of the blade, or 
" navel " end of the blade. This part 
of the animal is largely used for 
corning. The ribs may also be di- 
vided into first, second and third cuts. 
The latter lying nearest the chuck 
are slightly less desirable than the 
former. The chuck may also be di- 
vided in a similar way, the third cut 
being nearest the neck.

The names applied to different por-

The part nearest the ribs is often 
called " small end of loin " or " short 
steak." The other end is called " hip 
sirloin " or " sirloin." Between the 
" short " and the " sirloin " is a por- 
tion quite generally called the " ten- 
derloin " for the reason that the real 
tenderloin — the very tenderest strip 
of meat lying in the tenderloin — is 
found most fully developed in this 
cut. " Porterhouse steak " is the 
term usually ajjplied to either the

short steak or the tenderloin. The 
flank may be cut to inchide more of 
the loin, in which case the upper por- 
tion is called " flank steak." The 
larger part of the flank is, however,

very often corned, as is also the case 
with the rump. Or, the rump may be 
cut so as to include a portion of the 
loin, which is then sold as " rump 
steak." The portion of the round on 
the inside of the leg is frequently 
preferred to the outside as more 
tender than the latter. As the leg 
lies upon the butcher's table, this in- 
side of the round is usually the up- 
per or top side and is therefore 
called " top round." Sometimes the 
blade is called the "rattle." 

Cuts of Veal. — A side of veal cuts 
up into fewer parts and otherwise 
quite differently than a side of beef. 
The chuck is smaller and is often cut 
off with the neck. Or the chuck may 
be so cut as to take in part of the 
shoulder — more nearly like the chuck 
of beef. The shoulder of veal, as 
usually cut, includes the larger part 
of what is classed as chuck in the 
full grown animal. The under jiart 
of the forequarter, corresponding to 
the blade in beef, is often called the 
"breast" in veal. The part of the 
veal corresponding to the rump of 
beef is most often cut with the loin, 
but may be cut to form part of the 



leg. The fore and hind shanks of veal 
are sometimes called " knuckles." 

Cuts of Lamb and Mutton. — These 
number but six, three in each quar- 
ter. The chuck includes the ribs to 
the end of the shoulder blades. Be- 
yond this comes the loin. The flank 
is made to include all the underside 
of the animal. Some butchers how- 
ever include part of the "loin" and 
" chuck " in a cut known as the " ribs " 
and part of the flank and shoulder 
in a cut known as "brisket." The 
term "chops" is applied to parts of 
the loin, rib, chuck or shoulder, cut 
or chopped by the butcher into pieces 
for frying or boiling. The chuck and 
ribs are sometimes called the " rack." 

Cuts of Pork. — A large portion of 
the carcass of a dressed pig is al-

pork and bacon. The cut designated 
as " back " is almost clear fat used for 
salting and pickling. The "middle" 
cut is used for bacon or for lean 
ends of salt pork. The "belly" is 
salted, pickled or made into sausages. 
Beneath the " back " are the ribs and 
loins. They furnish the " spareribs,"

Cost of Different Cuts. — The table

portion of bone or other waste in the 
different kinds of cuts and the effect 
of this waste in the actual, as com- 



makes it appear that the chuck ribs 
are less than half as expensive as 
porterhouse steak and two-thirds as 
expensive as the round. But appar- 
ent economy is not always real econ- 
omy. In this case the bones in the 
three cuts should be taken into ac- 
count. Of the chuck ribs, more than 
one-half is bone or other materials 
usually classed under the head of 
' waste ' or ' refuse.' Of the round, 
one-twelfth is waste, and of the por- 
terhouse, one-eighth. In buying the

purpose of making it possible to compare nominal with net prices. 



pared with the apparent cost of meat. 
Langworthy says : " The relative 
retail prices of various cuts usually 
bear a direct relation to the favor 
with which they are regarded by the 
majority of persons. The juicy, ten- 
der cuts, of good flavor, sell for the 
higher prices. When porterhouse 
steak sells for 25 cents a pound, it 
may be assumed that in town or vil- 
lage markets round steak would ordi- 
narily sell for about 15 cents, and 
chuck ribs, one of the best cuts of 
the forequarter, for 10 cents. This 



chuck, then, the housewife gets, at 
the prices assumed, less than one- 
half pound of food for 10 cents. 
This makes the net price of the edi- 
ble portion 22 cents a pound. In 
buying round, she gets eleven-twelfths 
of a pound for 15 cents. This makes 
the net value about 16^ cents. In 
buying porterhouse, she gets seven- 
eighths of a pound for 25 cents. 
This makes the net value about 28i 
cents a pound. The relative prices, 
therefore, of the edible portions are 
22, 16i and 28i cents. Or to put

it in a different way, a dollar at the 
prices assumed will buy 4^ pounds 
of solid meat from the cut known as 
chuck, 6 pounds of such meat from 
the round, and only 3^ pounds of 
such meat from the porterhouse." 

Owing to the extremely high price 
of meats in recent years a special 
study has been made by the United 
Slates Government on the economical 
use of meat in the home. The con- 
clusion has been reached that the ex- 
pense for meat can be reduced in a 
number of different ways. Among 
these may be mentioned lessening of 
the amount of meat used as food; 
buying meat in quantity for home 
use; utilizing the fat, bone and trim- 
mings and the left-over cold meats; 
extending the flavor of meats to vari- 
ous vegetables and cereals by means 
of mixed dishes; utilizing the cheaper 
cuts; and developing and improving 
the flavor by proper methods of 
cookery, including use of herbs, 
spices, sauces and the like. 

To accomplish these results a num- 
ber of valuable recipes have been 
prepared by Miss Caroline L. Hunt, 
an expert in nutrition, under the 
supervision of Dr. C. F. Langworthy, 
who has been in charge of this inves- 
tigation, many of which are so valu- 
able as to merit reproduction else- 
where in this volume. 

In general, it is suggested that 
most American families eat too much 
meat and that the simplest way to 
reduce the meat bill would be to 
serve meat once only, instead of two 
or three times a day, or to use less 
meat at a time. One good meat dish 
a day will furnish sufficient proteid, 
provided other and cheaper substi- 
tutes such as eggs, milk, cheese and 
beans are used instead. Fish might 
well be substituted for meat for the 
sake of variety as well as of econ- 
omy, wherever it can be obtained 
fresh and cheap. Canned or salt fish 
also makes a useful and economical 
variation of the diet. 

FISH AS FOOD 

The flesh of fish is included with 
that of other animals on the food 
map on page 22. This shows that 



fish is similar in composition to meat 
and occupies much the same place 
in the diet. It contains practically 
no carbohydrates but consists almost 
wholly of proteid and fat in varying 
proportions. Some fish, such as fat 
mackerel, shad and salmon, contain a 
high percentage of fat. And these 
are believed to be less easily and 
readily digestible than the leaner 
kinds such as cod, haddock, perch, 
pike, bluefish and others. The ash 
or mineral matter in fish does not 
vary greatly in quantity or value 
from other foods. The notion that 
fish are richer in phosphorus, and 
hence more valuable as a brain food 
for students and other sedentary 
workers, has no scientific foundation. 
Experiments do not indicate that fish 
contain a larger percentage of phos- 
phorus than other kinds of flesh used 
as food, nor that phosphorus is any 
more essential to the brain than ni- 
trogen, potassium or other elements. 
The percentage of available nutrients 
per pound is somewhat less in fish 
than in most kinds of meat because 
fish contains a much larger propor- 
tion of water. But this difference is 
offset by the difference in cost under 
ordinary conditions and prices. 

A careful comparative study of dif- 
ferent sources of proteid shows that 
shell fish are the most expensive and 
the cheaper meats, fish and cereals 
less expensive in the order mentioned. 
As sources of energy, shell fish are 
higher in price than common fish. 
The ordinary kinds of meats and the 
cereals are most economical. Both 
fish and the leaner kinds of meat are 
deficient in materials which yield 
muscular power. But when supple- 
mented by bread, potatoes and the 
like, they are the more important 
parts of a well-balanced diet. 

Cautions Concerning Fish. — Avoid 
fish which is not perfectly fresh and 
especially that which has been frozen 
and kept for a time after thawing 
and before being cooked. Such fish 
is liable to rapid decomposition with 
the forming of ptomaine poisons. 
As a general rule fish are unfit for 
food if tlie eyes are dull, the ball of 
the eye clouded, the gills pale and 
frothy, the scales dry and easily 



32 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



loosened, or the meat so soft that it 
can be dented with the finger like 
putty. To test fish about which you 
are in doubt, lay them in water. If 
they sink they are probably good. 
But if they float they are certainly 
unfit for food. Remove canned fish 
promjitly from the can and use at 
once. If left in the can there is 
danger of poisoning from metallic 
oxides formed by the action of the 
air on the inside of the can. More- 
over, canned fish deteriorates very 
rapidly after being opened. 

Do not buy or use clams in the 
shell unless they are alive. That is, 
use only clams which close the shell 
when taken out of water. Also avoid 
oysters which are not perfectly fresh. 
Oysters dead in the shell and even 
sliglitly decomposed may be extreme- 
ly poisonous. When removed from 
water good oysters close the shell, 
move when touched, are of normal 
size and color and have a clear fluid 
inside the shell. In the case of dead 
oysters the shells remain open. The 
oysters in a short time become dis- 
colored and very soft. They have a 
stale odor and show blackish rings in- 
side the shell. Oysters are some- 
times " floated " or " fattened " in 
water contaminated with sewage, and 
death sometimes residts from eating 
them from typhoid fever and other 
diseases. The only safeguard against 
such conditions is to buy oysters only 
from the most reliable dealers. 

POULTRY AND DAIRY PRODUCTS 

In addition to meat and fish, the 
chief sources of proteid in the ordi- 
nary mixed diet are poultry and dairy 
products. Poultry diflFers very little 
in composition from other kinds of 
flesh used as food and is but slightly 
more digestible than beef, pork or 
mutton. The difference in digestibil- 
ity between the different kinds of 
poultry depends chiefly upon the 
amount of fat present. Fat birds 
such as fat geese are least easily di- 
gested. Tenderness assists digestion; 
hence young birds are more easily 
digested than old. The less used 
muscles such as those of the breast 
are also more digestible than the 



much used muscular tissues of the 
thighs or " drumsticks." Experiments 
indicate that there is very little dif- 
ference in digestibility between the 
white fleshed and dark fleshed birds, 
or between the white and dark meat 
of the same species. 

From the standpoint of economy, 
home-grown chickens fed chiefly upon 
table scraps, sour milk and other by- 
products are among the cheapest and 
most wholesome kinds of food. 
Reckoning the cost of the actual nu- 
trients, chicken as purchased in city 
markets at low or average prices is 
the cheajjest kind of poultry. It then 
compares favorably in economy with 
the cheaper cuts of beef and pork. 
Turkey and goose may be compared 
in value and economy to sirloin of 
beef and leg of lamb. Out-of-season 
chicken and turkey, capon, duck and 
green goose are more expensive. 
Squabs, pheasant and quail are so 
dear as to be luxuries. Their place 
can be filled, however, in most lo- 
calities at little or no expense by 
trapping the ordinary English spar- 
row. These birds are equally as fine 
as game birds in flavor. They are 
especially valuable as delicacies in 
sickness, either broiled or used as 
the basis of stews or broths. The 
chief value of game and poultry to 
invalids is found in the extractives 
they contain. These under proper 
methods of cooker^y give the charac- 
teristic flavor which makes the pa- 
tient's " mouth water," i. e., they start 
the digestive juices flowing and stim- 
ulate the appetite. 

Eggs are a very important part of 
the average dietary. They furnish a 
light, easily digested food, rich in 
proteid and especially suitable for 
breakfast or other light meals and 
useful for persons of sedentary 
habits. It is the practice of many 
families of moderate means to serve 
fresh meat for only one meal a day — 
i. e., dinner. They use for breakfast 
such foods as bacon, dried beef, cod 
fish or left-over meats. For lunch 
or supper, they have bread and but- 
ter, with cold meats and otlier left- 
overs, and perhaps the addition of 
cooked, fresh or preserved fruits. It 
is not sound economy to omit eggs 



FOOD VALUES AND ADULTERATIONS

from such a diet. At ordinary prices 
they are among the cheapest sources 
of proteid and should be used freely 
as meat substitutes. Eggs at 25 
cents a dozen are cheaper than meat, 
especially if one egg is sufficient to 
satisfy each person or if the average 
is less than two eggs per person, as 
will usually prove to be the case. 
Even at high prices the occasional 
use of eggs in the place of meat need 
not be regarded as a luxury. 



equivalent to three-fourths of a 
pound of meat or 6 ounces of bread. 
On the other hand milk is some- 
times spoken of as the only perfect 
food. This is perhaps true in the 
sense that it is possible to sustain 
life indefinitely upon an exclusive 
milk diet. Such a diet is sometimes 
prescribed in the treatment of rheu- 
matism and in some other diseases. 
Persons doing ordinary sedentary or 
light work can take sufficient mifik to

Milk and Skim Milk.— While milk 
is universally recognized as the stand- 
ard food of infancy and childhood 
its value as a food for adults is often 
underestimated. Milk is most com- 
monly thought of merely as a bever- 
age like coffee, tea or water. It is 
taken or not according to taste — 
or to satisfy thirst — rather than as 
a substitute for meat or other sub- 
stantial portion of the diet. Yet a 
single glass of milk contains about as 
much of the nutritive value of a meal 
as a quarter of a loaf of bread or 
a good slice of roast beef. A quart 
of fresh milk contains nutrients 



sustain themselves in good health and 
to furnish normal energy for periods 
of several months. But such a diet 
is not advisable for adults under ordi- 
nary conditions for the reason — 
among others — that to secure the re- 
quired amoimt of carbohydrate it is 
necessary to take a much larger 
amount of proteid than is necessary. 
Yet these facts indicate that milk 
should be regarded as a substantial 
food. 

Skim milk is often regarded on 
the farm as having little food value. 
It may be purchased in cities at a 
very low rate, usually about 2 or 3

cents a quart. Yet even after the 
bulk of the butter fat has been re- 
moved from milk by skimming, the 
solid nutrients make up nearly one- 
tenth of its entire weight and it af- 
fords one of the cheapest sources of 
proteid generally available. A lunch 
or meal of bread and skim milk is 
very nutritious in proportion to its 



Many housewives hesitate to re- 
move the cream from whole milk in 
the belief that they are thus robbing 
members of their family, and espe- 
cially growing children, of a neces- 
sary kind of nutriment. But this is 
not the case. The fuel value of the 
butter fat removed in cream can be 
supplied in the ordinary diet more

cost and convenience. Eight ounces 
of bread eaten with a pint of skim 
milk will furnish very nearly one- 
third of the proteid required for a 
day's nutriment at a cost of 5 cents. 
As compared with the ordinary mixed 
diet of meat and potatoes, bread and 
skim milk make a better balanced 
and equally wholesome ration. 



cheaply by the use of butter, meat, 
sweets and other carbohydrates. And 
the skim milk is rich in carbohydrates 
and proteid. Many families in mod- 
erate circumstances who are in the 
habit of drinking whole milk and 
buying cream, would be quite as well 
off if the top of the milk for 2 or 3 
inches were poured into the cream

pitcher. And there would he a 
marked saving in the cost of cream. 

Growing children will ordinarily 
drink freely of skim milk, if it is 
available, and nothing could be more 
wholesome for them. But since the 
older members of the family may not 
take kindly to skim milk as a food, 
it is an excellent plan to use it freely 
in cookery. Skim milk should be pre- 
ferred to water for making bread and 
for all other recipes for which it is 
available. 

Milk soups furnish an excellent 
means of increasing the food value 
of a meal or using up superfluous 
milk. Milk may be mixed with stock 
made from meat, or used as a basis 
of vegetable purees, such as bean, pea, 
potato, corn and celery soups, or 
tomato bisque and the like. Oyster 
stew made of milk owes its food value 
to the milk more than to the oys- 
ters. 

Milk "white" or "cream" sauces 
are also very useful. They are nutri- 
tious and are a convenient and eco- 
nomical way of using up left-overs. 
Numerous recipes found elsewhere in 
this volume for puddings, desserts, 
blanc-mange, ice cream and junket, il- 
lustrate the many ways in which sur- 
plus milk may be used up in the or- 
dinary mixed diet. Among ordinary 
by-products of milk may be mentioned 
— junket, cottage cheese, butter milk, 
whey, sour milk or clabber, and kou- 
miss. All of these may profitably be 
employed to give variety. 

Cheese. — One of the most impor- 
tant among dairy products is cheese. 
This has been a common article of 
diet among civilized people since the 
earliest times. Yet, oddly enough, 
its food value is not fully appre- 
ciated and it labors under what seems 
to be an unfounded prejudice, being 
supposed to cause certain digestive 
disturbances. Cheese is among the 
best of all meat substitutes and, at 
ordinary prices, is one of the cheap- 
est sources of proteid. Its flavor is 
so pronounced that there may be one 
or more members of a family who do 
not relish it. And from lack of ex- 
perience most housekeepers are un- 
skillful in the use of cheese in cook- 
ery. Yet when properly cooked and 



relished it may fill an important place 
in the diet. 

A series of careful experiments 
under the auspices of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture have led to the 
conclusion that cheese, when used by 
normal healthy persons in sufficient 
quantity to be a substitute for meat, 
is not indigestible. Nor does it seem 
to cause any digestive disturbances. 
While there are persons with whom 
cheese does not agree, the same is 
true with many other articles of diet. 
If it should have a tendency to pro- 
duce constipation, this may be offset 
by adding fruits and fruit juices to 
the diet. Bread and cheese taken 
with fruit is a thoroughly well bal- 
anced and very economical ration. A 
number of suggestive bills of fare 
and recipes for the use of cheese, 
prepared under the supervision of the 
Department of Agriculture, are given 
elsewhere. 

SOURCES OF CARBOHYDRATES 

Sugar as Food. — Sugar, on account 
of its pleasant flavor and high nu- 
tritive value, is among the most de- 
servedly popular of all food prod- 
ucts. It occurs in several forms of 
which the best known are cane sugar 
— the ordinary granulated sugar and 
other well known kinds used in cook- 
ery — glucose, made from starch; milk 
sugar, grape sugar and honey. Sugar 
is also produced in large quantities 
from the sugar beet. And maple 
sugar is an important article of com- 
merce. Roughly speaking, sugar is 
the equivalent of starch after the 
latter has been digested and made 
soluble. Thus a mealy potato is very 
nearly akin to sugar, but — like all 
forms of starchy food — it must be 
turned into a kind of sugar by the 
digestive juices before it can be ab- 
sorbed by the system. This process 
is started by a ferment contained in 
the saliva. It is continued and com- 
pleted in the intestine. Sugar in 
proper quantity is very fully and 
rapidly digestible and is one of the 
most important sources of heat and 
energy in the diet. For this reason 
men employed at hard labor — espe- 
cially in cold chmates, as lumbermen 



36 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



in the northern forests — use large 
quantities of sugar in the form of 
molasses. And, for similar reasons, 
it is relished by children to supply 
the energy required by their active 
habits. 

Sugar, like starch, is fattening 
since, when taken in excess, it may 



valuable as flavors. They have high 
food value and may properly be re- 
garded as economical sources of heat 
and energy. Well-to-do families in 
our country consume about 2 pounds 
of sugar per week per person. Most 
of the bad eifects sometimes ascribed 
to sugar are due to its use in excess.

be transformed into fat and stored

sugar should be used sparingly by 
persons who tend to become corpu- 
lent.

ous sweet table sirups and molasses

Sugar is not any more harmful to 
the teeth than other foods. If al- 
lowed to cling to the teeth after eat- 
ing it rapidly ferments and forms

this is true also of starchy foods. 
The remedy is to be found in proper 
care of the teeth as elsewhere recom-

mended. Neither does sugar produce 
gout; although it may be injurious in 
large quantities in certain classes of 
illness. 

In addition to being used as a fla- 
vor in cooked foods and otherwise, 
considerable quantities of sugar are 
taken in fresh fruits — of which it 
sometimes forms one-tenth or more — 
and dried fruits such as figs, dates 
and raisins, of which as much as 50 
per cent may be sugar. 

Large quantities of sugar are also 
taken as confectionery. Cheap can- 
dies are made largely from glucose. 
This is no longer considered an in- 
jurious adulterant, although it is not 
quite so digestible as sugar and may, 
therefore, overload the stomach more 
easily. The best authorities seem to 
agree that, while sugar is a valuable 
food for growing children, it should 
be withheld from infants under two 
years of age. Nor should it be used 
for older children to sweeten cereal 
foods which form their staple food. 
Mush, porridge, and similar prepara- 
tions of wheat or other grain, should 
be eaten only with milk or cream. 
They are then in the same class as 
bread and milk and form the simple, 
wholesome basis of a meal. Sugar 
should preferably be given afterward 
in a simple pudding, or dessert, or 
in the form of lump sugar or home- 
made candy. Indeed, the best man- 
ner and time for giving candy to 
children is in the form of a few bon- 
bons for dessert rather than at all 
hours of the day between meals. 

Cereals. — Wheat bread and loaves 
of corn, rye or other cereal prod- 
ucts, together with the cereal break- 
fast foods, form a very essential part 
of the ordinary mixed diet. The va- 
rious cereals are- similar in chemical 
composition. They contain little fat, 
but consist, on an average, of 10 per 
cent proteid and from 60 to 80 per 
cent carbohydrate with varying pro- 
portions of water and ash. The ce- 
reals rank with milk and other dairy 
products as among the cheapest 
sources of nutriment. An average 
man at moderately active work re- 
quires about i of a pound of pro- 
teid with enough fats and carbohy- 
drates daily to make a total of 3,C00 



calories of available energy. Milk 
contains all three classes of nutri- 
ents but not in the proper propor- 
tions for healthy adults. Meats and 
cheese are rich in proteid and fat. 
Vegetables are especially rich in car- 
bohydrates. Cereals contain both 
proteid and carbohydrates but in such 
proportions that, in order to get the 
requisite amount of proteid from 
bread alone, one would have to take 
more carbohydrate than would other- 
wise be necessary. Hence, the com- 
bination of bread with such foods as 
meat, milk or cheese, which are rich 
in proteid, makes a much better bal- 
anced ration. 

All of the cereals contain an inner 
kernel surrounded by one or more 
outer hulls. These hulls are ordi- 
narily removed in the process of mill- 
ing and sold as bran which is fed to 
stock. The popular opinion that 
bread made from the entire grain is 
more wholesome is not sustained by 
scientific experiments. The bran con- 
tains a large proportion of cellulose, 
or woody fiber, which is wholly indi- 
gestible. This substance may have 
some value as a laxative in cases of 
constipation, since, by mechanical ac- 
tion it stimulates the peristaltic ac- 
tion of the bowel. But it adds very 
little nutritive value to the loaf. On 
the contrary, experiments indicate 
that its presence somewhat lessens the 
digestibility of the finer portion of 
the grain. On the whole it may be 
taken for granted that the ordinary 
white bread is not only more pala- 
table, and preferable for appearance 
sake, but is actually a more economi- 
cal source of nutriment. However, 
all kinds of bread are nutritious and 
are to be recommended for the sake 
of variety. This is equally as impor- 
tant in bread as in meats, vegetables 
and puddings. 

The cheaper grades of flour are 
about as nutritious as the more ex- 
pensive and may be used with- 
out hesitancy if economy is required. 
Crackers, macaroni, and the various 
kinds of cake made from white flour 
have practically the same nutritive 
value as bread and are equally well 
digested by healthy adults. Hot 
bread in the form of rolls and bis-

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



cuit is also found to be digestible, if 
properly masticated. The value of 
toast for invalids and others is due 
to several changes produced by heat- 
ing. A portion of the carbohydrates 
becomes more soluble and hence more 
easily digested. If the heating is 
strong enough anj"^ ferments and bac- 
teria present may be killed. Toast, 
on account of its dryness, is likely to 
be well masticated. And partial 
caramelization gives a crispness and 
flavor which stimulate the digestive 
juices. Bread made with skim milk 
makes a better balanced ration than 
that made with water alone and is 
preferable since it does not materially 
increase the cost. The common cus- 
tom of eating butter or some other fat 
with bread is justified by the fact that 
the cereals, with the exception of corn, 
have little or no fat content. 

Breakfast Foods. — Careful studies 
in large numbers of American fami- 
lies show that the various cereals fur- 
nish over one-fifth of the total food, 
about one-third of the total proteid 
and considerably over one-half of the 
total carbohydrates of the average 
dietary. Of these about 2 per cent 
are furnished by the modern cereal 
breakfast foods. Notwithstanding 
that the percentage is small, the total 
quantity of such foods consumed is 
very great. And the millions of dol- 
lars expended in advertising the 
claims of superiority made for these 
food^ by their manufacturers give the 
subject popular interest. A careful 
study of the principal breakfast foods, 
made under the supervision of the De- 
partment of Agriculture, indicates 
that their nutritive value and digesti- 
bility are practically the same as the 
old-fashioned porridge and similar 
dishes. The ready-to-eat cereals 
economize time and, to some extent, 
fuel. This advantage, may justify 
the difference in their cost under cer- 
tain conditions in the household. The 
process of preparation in most cases 
is thoroughly cleanly and sanitary. 
And the small pasteboard packages in 
which these products are put up pro- 
tect the contents from all possible 
contamination. They also aflFord a 
convenient means of storage in the 
pantry. In general it was found that 



the less expensive kinds of raw cereal 

breakfast foods selling for about 4 
cents a pound in bulk were as eco- 
nomical as flour, meal, or other 
forms of cereals with which they may 
be properly compared. The higher 
prices of ready-to-eat brands, how- 
ever, do not yield any additional nu- 
triment. Their advantage, if any, lies 
in their convenience and the pleasant 
variety they aiford. Some of these 
are excessively high in price, the maxi- 
mum being about 15 cents per pound, 
or nearly four times as much as their 
nutritive value would justify. 

The so-called malted foods and 
others said to be predigested, are per- 
haps the most objectionable of any. 
The claims made for them are largely 
fraudulent. The addition of malt and 
similar processes are designed to 
transform the starch content of such 
foods into sugar and other soluble 
forms. Experiment with most of the 
advertised foods shows that this has 
really not been done to any appreci- 
able extent. Moreover, healthy adults 
are more likely to be injured than 
benefited by the use of predigested 
foods. Nor should they be used by 
invalids except upon the advice of a 
competent physician. Hence, while 
these foods are really more whole- 
some than they would be if actually 
predigested, they are sold under mis- 
representation, and at excessively 
high prices which are in no way jus- 
tifiable. 

Coffee Substitutes. — Cereal prod- 
ucts as coflFee substitutes aj^pear to 
be made of parched barley, wheat 
and other grain, sometimes mixed 
with pea hulls, corn cobs or bran. 
Such grain parched with a little 
molasses in an ordinary oven makes 
something undistinguishable in fla- 
vor from the cereal coffees on the 
market. The claim of the manufac- 
turers that these substitutes yield 
more nourishment than coffee is en- 
tirely unfounded. They contain lit- 
tle or no nutriment, skim milk being 
about twenty times as nutritive. If 
strict economy is necessary it will be 
found equally as satisfactory to use 
old-fashioned •' crust coffee " made 
by toasting broken crusts of white, 
brown, or preferably " rye and In-

water and straining until compara- 
tively clear. Or parched corn, rye, 
sweet potato or other old-fashioned 
coffee substitutes may be used. 

Vegetables in the Diet. — In addi- 
tion to the cereals, vegetable foods 
may be classified as legumes, tubers, 
roots and bulbs, green vegetables and 
fruita. The principal legumes used 



important nutrient, that they may 
well be used for the sake of both 
economy and variety, as substitutes 
for meat in the daily dietary. The 
lack of fat in legumes suggests the 
addition of butter or other suitable 
fat, as salt pork, in the process of 
cooking. Dietary studies and experi- 
ments with legumes indicate that, 
when properly cooked and combined

as food are peas, beans, cow-peas 
and lentils. While about one-half of 
these consists of carbohydrate in the 
form of starch, they also contain 
about one-fourth proteid. The re- 
mainder is chiefly water and refuse, 
since the proportion of fat which they 
contain is small. The dried legumes

This and other root crops contain 
from 70 to 90 per cent of water. 
Hence the digestible nutrients pres- 
ent are somewhat less than 10 to 30 
per cent. The greater ]iart of the 
solid matter consists of carbohydrate. 
The amount of proteid and fat fur- 
nished by root crops is negligible. 
Hence, potatoes and other roots must 
be balanced in the diet by meat, milk, 



potatoes especially about the time 
they begin to sprout and become soft 
and watery. Discard, esi)ecially in 
the case of old potatoes, any which 
have been turned green by the sun. 
The green portion contains solanin, a 
virulent acid poison. The danger 
from this increases the longer the 
potato is kept before being u.sed. 
Potatoes rank next to bread stuffs

as a source of carbohydrate in the 
diet. 

The sweet potato resembles the 
white potato in composition although 
it contains a larger proportion of 
sugar and there are some other dif- 
ferences. It is equally as whole- 
some. While slightly more expen- 
sive it is to be recommended, at ordi- 
nary prices, as a substitute for the 
white potato for the sake of variety. 

Succulent roots, tubers and bulbs 
such as beets, carrots, parsnips, tur- 
nips, onions and the like are much 
less important as source of nutrients 
than the cereal foods, or the starchy 
roots and tubers such as the potato. 
Their chief value lies in their flavors 
as aids to digestion. They also sup- 
ply the body with mineral salts and 
by their bulk and the proportion of 
cellulose which they contain stimulate 
the peristaltic action of the bowel. 

Fresh fruits are similar to green 
vegetables in composition, but they 
often contain considerable percent- 
ages of sugar. They are very dilute 
foods and usually contain 80 per cent 
or more of water. With the notable 
exception of the olive, fruits contain 
very little fat, nor do they have any 
importance as sources of proteid. 
They have some nutritive value as 
sources of carbohydrate, chiefly in 
the form of sugar, the percentage of 
which in common fruits ranges from 
1 to as high as 15 per cent. But 
like green vegetables their value is 
chiefly in their flavors and mineral 
salts as aids to digestion and in their 
laxative effect. 

Experiments have shown that per- 
sons living on an exclusive fruit and 
nut diet may apparently maintain 
their health and strength for a con- 
siderable length of time. The cost of 
such diet, however, does not differ 
greatly from that of an ordinary 
mixed diet. Nor is there anything to 
show that it is in other respects equal 
or superior. Dried and preserved 
fruits form an especially important 
part of the diet since they may con- 
tain 50 per cent or more of available 
carbohydrates in the form of sugar, 
in addition to many characteristics of 
fresh fruit. In short fruits are a 
valuable part of a well-balanced diet 



and may well be eaten in larger 
quantities than at present. 

FOOD ADULTERATIONS 

A preservative added to a food is 
an adulteration, because it is a for- 
eign substance and neither a food nor 
a condiment. It is an entirely differ- 
ent question whether the food thus 
preserved is wholesome. A commer- 
cial sausage may contain a considera- 
ble amount of starch, which is added 
in order to allow the use of more fat 
or water to the product This is not 
injurious, but the customer buys the 
product at a high price believing that 
he is getting a genuine sausage and 
nothing else. 

On account of the frequent use of 
adulterants, some simple tests are 
here given. These can be performed 
without any special chemical knowl- 
edge by carefully following the di- 
rections given. Any housekeeper or 
teacher can do the work. These in- 
structions were compiled by E. H. S. 
Bailey, Ph. D., for the Kansas State 
Board of Health. The complete de- 
tails of many of the processes are 
given in the recent article by Bigelow 
and Howard, in Bulletin No. 100, 
United States Department of Agri- 
culture, Bureau of Chemistry. From 
this excellent publication many of the 
following tests are taken. 

Kitchen Tests. — In addition to the 
ordinary kitchen dishes and utensils 
the following will be required: One 
glass funnel, three inches in diameter; 
white cut filter-papers, five inches in 
diameter; and one medicine-dropper. 
The chemicals required are: One 
four-ounce bottle of strong hydro- 
chloric (muriatic) acid; one four- 
ounce bottle of aqua ammonia; one 
eight-ounce bottle of chloroform; one 
one-quarter pound bottle of hydro- 
gen peroxide; one one-ounce bottle of 
tincture of iodine; one-quarter of an 
ounce of ferric alum; one-half an 
ounce of logwood chips; one-quarter 
of a pound of fuller's earth; a few 
pieces of sheet zinc; a few square 
inches of turmeric-paper. 

All of the above can be readily ob- 
tained at any drug store. If it is 
proposed to have the chemicals about

the house, the bottles should be pro- 
vided with poison labels by the drug- 
gist 

CANNED VEGETABLES 

Vegetables put up by reputable 
manufacturers who think it worth 
while to keep a good brand on the 
market are usually of good quality 
and wholesome. Sometimes, however, 
coloring matter and preservatives are 
present. Notice the appearance of 
the tin can containing canned vege- 
tables or fruit. If it is convex in- 
stead of concave at the ends, and if 
when water is poured on the end of 
the can and the can is punctured, bub- 
bles of gas come out through the wa- 
ter, the contents have begun to fer- 
ment and are not fit for use. 

Copper. — The only artificial color- 
ing matter usually found in canned 
vegetables is copper. This is added 
to produce a natural green color. 
This is most likely to be found in 
peas and string-beans. It has also 
been frequently used in pickles. 

To test for copper: Mash two 
heaping tablespoonfuls of the sam- 
ple with a stiff spoon, and put the 
pulp in a teacup, with three times as 
much water. With a medicine-drop- 
per add thirty drops of hydrochloric 
acid, and set the cup in a pan of boil- 
ing water on the stove. Drop a 
bright two-penny nail in the mixture, 
and keep the water in the pan boiling 
for about twenty minutes. Take care 
to stir the solution occasionally with 
a splinter. Pour out the contents of 
the cup, rinse off the nail and exam- 
ine it. If any appreciable quantity 
of copper is present in the food the 
nail will be plated red. 

PRESERVATIVES 

The preservatives most commonly 
used in canned vegetables are borax, 
sodium benzoate and salicylic acid. 
Sodium sulphite is also sometimes 
added both to bleach the product and 
to act as a preservative. Saccharin, 
which acts very slightly as a preserva- 
tive, is used with such vegetables as 
sweet corn and in tomato catsup, as a 
sweetening agent. 



Borax. — To detect borax or boric 
acid, mash a sample, as for copper, 
with a tumbler used as a pestle in a 
tea saucer, add a few teaspoonfuls 
of water, and strain through a cloth, 
putting the wet, folded cloth in the 
funnel. Collect about a teaspoonful 
of the liquid that comes through the 
filter in a sauce-dish, and add to this 
four drops of hydrochloric acid. Dip 
into this solution a piece of yellow 
turmeric-paper about an inch square. 
Then dry the paper by placing it in 
a clean saucer over a teakettle of 
boiling water. If borax is present, 
the yellow paper will become cherry- 
red when dry. If a drop or two of 
ammonia be put upon it, when cold, 
the color will change to a greenish 
black. 

Benzoic and Salicylic Acid. — To 
detect sodium benzoate or benzoic 
acid and salicylic acid, macerate and 
filter a sample as above. By gently 
squeezing the bag or cloth contain- 
ing the sample, obtain two ounces of 
the liquid. Place this solution in a 
narrow bottle holding about five 
ounces. The ordinary quinine bot- 
tle of the druggist is convenient. Add 
a quarter of a teaspoonful of cream 
of tartar and about three tablesjioon- 
fuls of chloroform, and mix thor- 
oughly with a splinter. Do not shake 
too vigorously or the chloroform will 
not separate readily from the rest of 
the liquid. Pour the mixture into a 
tumbler, and after the chloroform 
layer has settled to the bottom of the 
tumbler, take out with a medicine- 
dropper all the clear chloroform pos- 
sible and divide it into two parts, 
A and B. 

Place one-half of the chloroform 
solution (A) in a glass sauce-dish. 
Set the dish on the outside of a win- 
dow-ledge close to the window, and 
allow the chloroform to evaporate. 
In cold weather the sauce-dish should 
be placed in a pan of hot water be- 
fore being placed on the window- 
ledge, when the chloroform has 
evaporated, if the quantity of ben- 
zoic acid is sufficient it will be seen 
in the bottom of the dish in small flat 
crystals. If the dish is warmed 
slightly the odor of gum benzoin 
may be recognized. A better con- 



FOOD VALUES AND ADULTERATIONS 



43 



firmatory test, however, is, without 
warming the residue left after the 
evaporation of the chloroform, to add 
to it a half teaspoonful of strong 
ammonia water and three teaspoon- 
fuls of strong hydrogen peroxide, as 
obtained at the drug store, and let 
the solution stand over night. The 
next day pour the liquid remaining 
in the sauce-dish into one of the tall 
bottles used above, add a piece of 
turmeric-paper and then hydrochloric 
acid, drop by drop, stirring with a 
splinter, until the turmeric-paper 
changes- from a brown to a clear yel- 
low color, then add chloroform as in 
the first part of thd? test, and after 
stirring thoroughly take out the 
chloroform with the dropper and al- 
low it to evaporate on the window- 
ledge. Finally treat the residue re- 
maining in the sauce-dish for sali- 
cylic acid as noted below. The treat- 
ment with ammonia and hydrogen 
peroxide was for the purpose of 
changing the benzoic acid to sali- 
cylic acid. 

To test the other half of the solu- 
tion (B) for salicylic acid, pour It 
into a tall five-ounce bottle contain- 
ing a tablespoonful of water, and add 
to the solution a piece of iron alum 
about as large as the head of a pin. 

Shake the mixture and allow the 
chloroform to again settle to the bot- 
tom of the bottle. If salicylic acid 
is present, the upper layer of the 
liquid, or the line separating the two 
liquids, will be of purple color. 

Sulphites. — To detect sulphites in 
food, as for instance in jelly or in 
sirups, place about an ounce of the 
material, with the addition of some 
water — if necessary — to make a thin 
liquid, in a tumbler, add a dozen 
small pieces of zinc, and about fifty 
drops of hydrochloric acid. Cover 
the tumbler with a sauce-dish, and al- 
low to stand for a few minutes in a 
warm place. In the presence of sul- 
phites the gas, hydrogen sulphide, 
which has a disagreeable odor like 
rotten eggs, can be recognized in the 
tumbler by the sense of smell. 

If the hydrogen sulphide cannot be 
detected by its odor, it can often be 
found by proceeding as follows: 
Stick, by means of sealing wax, a 



clean, bright ten-cent piece on a 
splinter of wood so that it will hold 
the silver coin above the liquid in the 
cup. Place the stick and coin in the 
tumbler and let it stand covered in 
a warm place for from thirty min- 
utes to an hour or so, if the color 
does not appear before. If the coin 
is stained brown to black, sulphites 
are indicated; the greater the quan- 
tity, the darker the stain. 

Saccharin. — Saccharin is used in 
the place of sugar to sweeten vari- 
ous food products. It is made from 
coal-tar and is about 500 times as 
sweet as ordinary sugar. To detect 
this substance, the sample of food is 
extracted with chloroform as de- 
scribed in the method for detecting 
sodium benzoate, and the chloroform 
solution is allowed to evaporate in a 
glass dish in the open air. If a con- 
siderable amount of saccharin is 
present the residue left in the dish 
will have an intensely sweet taste, 

CANNED FRUIT AND PRESERVES 

There is very little excuse for the 
use of preservatives, and not any at 
all for the use of artificial coloring 
matters in canned fruits. The pre- 
servatives mentioned under canned 
vegetables are those more commonly 
used, and the methods for their de- 
tection given in the previous section 
may also be applied to canned fruits. 

Jams, Jellies and Preserves. — 
There is no class of food products, 
with the exception of spices, so com- 
monly adulterated as jams and jel- 
lies. The basis for the cheap jellies 
is often the pomace or refuse from 
the cider-mill, the sweetening is glu- 
cose or corn sirup, the coloring mat- 
ter is a coal-tar dye. Hence the use 
of a preservative is almost always 
necessary. Starch is often used as a 
filler or gelatinizing agent. 

Dyeing Test. — To detect a coal-tar 
or anilin dye, mix a few teaspoonfuls 
of the jam or jelly with some water 
and filter first through cloth and aft- 
erwards through filter-paper. The 
filter-paper should be folded across 
the middle, and again at a right angle 
to this fold. Place in the funnel so 
that there shall be three thicknesses

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



on one side and one on the other. 
Moisten the paper with water to hold 
it in place. Add a few drops of hy- 
drochloric acid to the filtered solu- 
tion of the jelly, and place it in a 
teacup in a pan of boiling water on 
the stove. Boil a small piece (about 
an inch square) of white woolen cloth 
or nun's veiling with a little soap, 
and, after rinsing, place it in the col- 
ored solution to be tested. After 
heating for t«*" mimites, take out the 
cloth and rinse in clear water. If 
the cloth is not colored, the experi- 
ment may be discontinued. 

If, however, the cloth is colored, to 
confirm the test, heat the cloth in a 
teacup in clear water containing 
about a teaspoonful of ammonia. 
This will dissolve the anilin color out 
of the cloth, but will have little ef- 
fect on a natural fruit color. Take 
the piece of cloth and add enough 
hydrochloric acid to the contents of 
the cup so that the solution will not 
smell of ammonia. Put into this 
solution a new piece of washed wool- 
en cloth and heat again in a pan of 
water. If an anilin dye is present, 
the cloth will be dyed, and after 
heating a short time, may be taken 
out and rinsed in clear water. This 
method of testing may also be ap- 
plied to tomato catsup, which is fre- 
quently artificially colored. 

Starch. — If considerable starch 
paste has been added to a jelly, it 
may be detected by adding to the 
cold filtered solution a few drops of 
tincture of iodine. The production of 
an intense blue color indicates starch. 
Observe that this color may be modi- 
fied by any dye that is present in 
the sample examined. 

FLAVORING EXTRACTS AND CON- 
DIMENTS 

Lemon Extract. — The extracts in 
most common use are those of lemon 
and vanilla. Extract of lemon, ac- 
cording to the United States Phar- 
macopoeia, should contain 5 per cent 
of oil of lemon. About 85 per cent 
of alcohol is required to keep this in 
solution. Much of the extract of 
lemon on the market contains so lit- 
tle oil of lemon that it can with diffi- 



culty be measured. The oil is also 
often replaced by some other essen- 
tial oil, as that of lemon grass. To 
hold the small quantity of oil of 
lemon in solution, a 25 or 30 per cent 
alcohol is often used. The yellow 
color of this product is produced by 
the use of a yellow anilin dye. As 
oil of lemon is held in solution by 
alcohol, to test the character of the 
extract, add to a teaspoonful of the 
sample, in a tumbler, three times as 
much water. If the liquid does not 
become milky the sample is not gen- 
uine. If the solution remains per- 
fectly clear on the addition of the wa- 
ter, or is slightly turbid only, the 
extract is of very poor quality. When 
buying lemon extract, shake vigor- 
ously. If the foam does, not disap- 
pear immediately the extract is not 
genuine. 

Vanilla Extract. — Extract of van- 
illa, if genuine, is made by exhaust- 
ing vanilla beans with alcohol. Fre- 
quently Tonka beans are in part or 
wholly substituted for the vanilla 
beans. The coloring matter in the 
artificial extract is usually caramel, 
burnt sugar, or prune juice, and arti- 
ficial vanillin is added to strengthen 
the ordinary product. To detect car- 
amel, shake the bottle containing the 
extract, and observe the foam on the 
top of the liquid. If the extract is 
pure the foam is colorless and per- 
sists; but if caramel has been added, 
there is a brownish color at the point 
of contact of the bubbles until the 
last bubble disappears. 

As pure extract of vanilla contains 
considerable resin, which is held in 
solution by the alcohol, a test may be 
made for this as follows: Evaporate 
about two tablespoonfuls of the ex- 
tract in a sauce-dish placed over a 
teakettle of boiling water. WTien 
one-third of the liquid has evaporated 
off, pour the residue into a tumbler 
and dilute with water to the original 
volume. If the liquid is turbid, and 
the resin separates as a brownish 
substance, the extract is probably 
genuine. If, on the other hand, the 
liquid remains clear after dilution, 
though of course of a brown color, 
this indicates that it is artificial. 

Vinegar. — Vinegar is usually made 



FOOD VALUES AND ADULTERATIONS 



45 



from cider, wine, malt, or spirits. 
Much of the so-called "white wine 
vinegar " is made from spirits of al- 
cohol. One method of detecting the 
source of a vinegar is to rinse out 
a tumbler with the sample and allow 
it to stand over night. The odor of 
the residue will enable one who is ac- 
customed to these odors to detect 
the source of the vinegar. Another 
method is to evaporate some of the 
vinegar in a tea saucer over a tea- 
kettle of boiling water. The odor 
and taste of the residue left in 
the saucer are characteristic. From 
spirit vinegar the residue is very small 
in quantity and practically odorless. 

To detect the addition of caramel 
to vinegar, add about two teaspoon- 
fuls of fuller's earth to two ounces 
of vinegar, in a tall bottle of about 
five ounces' capacity. Shake vigor- 
ously, allow to stand a half hour, and 
filter. The first part of the filtrate 
should be poured through the filter 
a second time. Compare the color of 
this filtrate with the color of a sam- 
ple of the vinegar which has not been 
filtered. This may be conveniently 
poured into another bottle of the same 
size as that containing the filtered 
sample. If the coloring matter is 
largely removed by filtration, this in- 
dicates that the sample has been col- 
ored with caramel. 

Sulphuric Acid has often been used 
as an adulterant of vinegar. To de- 
tect it, moisten a lump of sugar with 
the suspected vinegar and place on a 
saucer. Place a second piece of 
sugar moistened with water on a sec- 
ond saucer, and put the two into a 
warm (not hot) oven. If the sugar 
moistened with the vinegar becomes 
brown to black after a short time, 
while the second piece remains white, 
the presence of sulphuric acid is in- 
dicated. 

Sugar; Honey. — Artificial honey is 
sometimes made by the use of com- 
mon sugar and glucose, which is flav- 
ored to resemble the natural product. 
To detect the latter, add to a some- 
what dilute solution of honey at 
least an equal volume of alcohol and 
stir. The production of a white pre- 
cipitate of dextrose, which finally set- 
tles to the bottom of the glass, indi- 



cates the presence of glucose. This 
test may also be applied to a solution 
of candy. Glucose is not, however, 
properly considered an adulterant in 
candy. 

To detect starch in candy, boil 
some of the solution, and after cool- 
ing add a few drops of a tincture 
of iodine. The production of an in- 
tense blue color indicates starch. 
White sugar, especially granulated, 
before the passage of the pure food 
laws, usually contained a little blue 
coloring matter, such as ultramar- 
ine. This may be detected by making 
a strong solution of sugar in a tum- 
bler and allowing it to stand for sev- 
eral days. The blue coloring matter 
will finally settle to the bottom of 
the glass. If saccharin is added to 
candy or a food product, it may be 
detected by the test given under 
" Canned Vegetables." 

Spices and Condiments. — Spices, 
especially those which are ground, are 
very often adulterated. If a sample 
has not a strong spicy odor and taste, 
this is an indication of adulteration. 
Cocoanut shells, prune pits and inert 
materials are often used as adulter- 
ants, but starchy substances are also 
extensively used. But observe that 
many spices also naturally contain 
starch. This is not the case, how- 
ever, with cloves, mustard, and cay- 
enne. Hence these may be tested for 
starch as follows: Stir a half-tea- 
spoonful of the spice into half a cup 
of boiling water, and heat in a pan 
of water on the stove for a few min- 
utes. Cool the mixture, and dilute 
with water so that the solution shall 
not be very strongly colored. Add a 
few drops of tincture of iodine. The 
production of a blue color indicates 
starch. 

To test for turmeric. — a vegetable 
coloring matter in ground mustard — 
digest some of the sample with alco- 
hol, and after a short time dip a 
piece of white filter-paper in the mix- 
ture. If the paper is colored a bright 
yellow turmeric is probably present. 

BAEINO CHEMICALS 

Baking Powder. — As the statement 
that appears on the label of a bak- 



46 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



ing powder can is often deceptive, it 
may be of interest to prove whether a 
sample contains alum or not. To test 
for alum, make a fresh extract of 
logwood, either from the chips or the 
solid extract, by treating with water 
and pouring away the first and sec- 
ond extracts. Use the third extract 
obtained and allow it to settle. Place 
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder 
in a teacup and add to it four tea- 
spoonfuls of cold water. With a med- 
icine-dropper add twenty drops of 
extract of logwood to the mixture 
and stir with a splinter. Place the 
teacup in a pan of hot water on the 
stove and examine the color after 
two hours. If the baking powder 
contains alum, or a compound of 
aluminum, a distinct lavender color 
will be produced, but if this sub- 
stance is not present in the sample, 
only a dirty brown or pink color will 
appear. It is well to make a test at 
first on samples of known composi- 
tion, so as to recognize the colors ac- 
curately. 

Cream of Tartar. — The cream of 
tartar on the market is frequently 
adulterated with acid calcium phos- 
phate, alum, and even plaster, and 
starch. A simple test to determine 
the purity of the sample is to stir 
one level teaspoonful of it into a cup- 
ful of boiling water. Pure cream of 
tartar will dissolve completely, but 
many of the adulterants will only 
partially dissolve. The solution may 
then be poured into a tumbler that 
has been previously warmed. When 
cold, the cream of tartar will crystal- 
lize out in very characteristic crystals. 
To detect starch, add to a little of 
the cooled solution a few drops of 
tincture of iodine. The production 
of a blue color indicates that starch 
or flour is present. 

TEA AND COFFEE 

There is hardly any adulterated 
tea on the market, although there are 
some very poor grades and there may 
be too much " tea siftings " in the 
sample. Ground coffee is very often 
adulterated. Some simple tests for 
adulterants may be made. If ground 
coffee is dropped into a glass of 



cold water, the genuine coffee will 
float, and will not discolor the water 
for several minutes. Most of the 
adulterants sink to the bottom and 
leave a brown trail in the water. But 
little coffee is contained in the so- 
called " coffee substitutes." The pro- 
portion of coffee in a sample may be 
ascertained approximately by drop- 
ping it into cold water, as very few 
coffee substitutes will float. 

Many of the substitutes are of a 
starchy nature. Starch may be test- 
ed for in the ordinary infusion pre- 
pared for the table, when cold, by 
diluting it until it is not too strong- 
ly colored, and then testing by tinc- 
ture of iodine. (See test under 
" Sugar.") 

DAIRY PRODUCTS 

Milk, butter, ice cream and 
cheese are frequently adulterated. 
Milk is adulterated by adding water, 
coloring matters and preservatives. 
When water is added to milk, it 
changes the natural color, and the 
milk becomes bluish-white. If a yel- 
low coal-tar dye has been added to 
the milk to restore the natural color 
when watered, this may be detected 
by adding an equal quantity of 
strong hydrochloric acid to a sample 
of the milk and afterwards heating. 
A pink coloration indicates the pres- 
ence of the dye. 

Another test is to allow the milk 
to stand in a tumbler for about 
twelve hours, or until the creara 
rises, and notice the color of the 
cream and of the milk layer. If the 
lower layer is of a yellow color, 
about the same as that of the cream, 
an artificial color is indicated. 

To detect annatto, a yellow color- 
ing matter, stir some washing soda 
into the milk, and after standing a 
few minutes filter through filter pa- 
per. Then wash the milk off the pa- 
per, and if annatto is present the pa- 
per is colored yellow to orange. 

If the milk does not turn sour in 
the usual time, the presence of a 
preservative is indicated. Baking 
soda is sometimes added to correct 
the acid of the milk. If an appre- 
ciable quantity of this substance has 



FOOD VALUES AND ADULTERATIONS 



47 



been used, the milk, after standing a 
few hours, will have a slightly alka- 
line reaction; that is, it will change a 
piece of yellow turmeric paper to an 
orange-red color. 

Formaldehyde. — Other preserva- 
tives are sometimes used, but that 
which is the most common is formal- 
dehyde or formalin, because a little 
goes a long way as a preservative. 
To detect this substance, place four 
tablespoonfuls of the sample in a 
teacup, with an equal quantity of 
strong hydrochloric acid and a piece 
of ferric alum about the size of the 
head of a pin. After mixing, by giv- 
ing the contents of the cup a rotary 
motion, place the cup in a pan of boil- 
ing water on the stove, and allow to 
stand for five minutes. If formalde- 
hyde is present, the mixture will be 
of a purple color. A similar test may 
be made for formaldehyde in ice 
cream, although if starch is present 
in the cream this may modify the 
shade of the purple. 

Butter. — The substitutes for gen- 
uine butter are " process " or " reno- 
vated " butter, and oleomargarin or 
" butterine." Process butter is made 
by treating old or rancid butter by 
melting, skimming and allowing the 
brine and curd to sink to the bottom, 
whence it is drawn off. Air is then 
blown through the melted butter-fat, 
and the product is churned with milk 
or cream. Oleomargarin is made 
from various mixtures of oleo-oil, cot- 
tonseed-oil, neutral lard and milk or 
butter. It should always be sold un- 
der its true name. 

The spoon test may be used to dis- 
tinguish fresh butter from renovated 
butter and oleomargarin. A lump of 
butter the size of a hickory nut is 
placed on a large iron spoon and 
heated over the flame of a small 
kerosene or alcohol lamp or over a 
gas flame. Fresh butter will melt 
quietly, with many small bubbles 
throughout the mass, which produce 
much foam; oleomargarin or process 
butter will splutter and crackle, like 
hot fat containing water, and produce 
but little foam. 

To make the "milk test," as it is 
called, place about two ounces of 
sweet milk in a wide-mouthed bot- 



tle, which is set in a pan of boiling 
water on the stove. When the milk 
is hot, add a teaspoonful of butter, 
and stir with a splinter until the 
fat is melted. Place the bottle in a 
pan of ice water and stir continually 
while the fat is solidifying. If the 
sample is butter, either fresh or 
renovated, it will solidify in a gran- 
ular condition and be distributed 
through the milk in small granular 
particles. If, on the other hand, the 
sample is olemargarin, it solidifies 
practically in a single lump, so that 
it may be lifted from the bottle with 
a stirrer. 

Eggs. — Probably the best method 
for testing the freshness of eggs is 
the time-honored one of candling. 
The egg is held between the eye and 
a bright light. A fresh egg shows a 
perfectly uniform rose-colored tint, 
while if not fresh there will be num- 
erous dark spots. 

In packed eggs there is a tendency 
for the white and yolk to slightly in- 
termingle along the line of contact. 
Packed eggs also are apt to adhere 
to the shell on one side. If eggs 
have been in a nest for any length of 
time they are smooth and glossy and 
the appearance is entirely different 
from the dull, rough surface of fresh 
eggs. 

MEAT PRODUCTS 

The preservatives most commonly 
used in meat products are borax, 
boric acid and sodium sulphite. The 
latter chemical also develops a bright 
red color in the meat in imitation of 
the natural red of fresh cut meat. 
If the meat keeps an exceptionally 
long time without a tendency to spoil, 
or if it retains its red color, the 
presence of preservatives may be 
suspected. 

The method of testing for borax, 
which has already been described un- 
der " Canned Vegetables," may be 
used in testing meat products. The 
meat must be finely divided, and 
should be warmed with water for 
some time, then the liquid which is 
filtered off should be tested. To test 
for sulphites, see process described 
under " Canned Vegetables."

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Sausages. — The principal adultera- 
tion of sausages, in addition to the 
introduction of inedible meats into 
the product, is the addition of starch. 
This is added as a " filler " to allow 
the incorporation of more fat and 
water and on the ground that it pre- 
vents shrinkage when fried. It should 
be remembered in this connection, 



however, that starch is cheaper than 
meat. To detect this adulteration 
boil the sausage in water, pour the 
resulting liquid into a teacup and al- 
low it to cool thoroughly. Then take 
out some of the liquid below the fat 
with a dropper, and test with tinc- 
ture of iodine for starch as described 
under "Jams and Jellies." 



CHAPTER II 
HOUSEHOLD WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 

PRINCIPLES OF MEASUREMENT — TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND 
MEASURES — TIME REQUIRED FOR COOKING — COOK'S COM- 
PLETE TIME TABLE. 



The uniform accuracy of results ob- 
tained by professional cooks, bakers, 
and caterers is due, in great degree, 
to the fact that the measurement of 
ingredients called for by their recipes 
is accurately determined by weight, 
and the temperature of their ovens 
is definitely ascertained by means of 
the thermometer. Thus the condi- 
tions surrounding the food cooked are 
made identical, and imiformity in the 
product necessarily follows. Any 
cook can obtain similar results by like 
means, and a good pair of scales in 
the kitchen may be regarded as one of 
the marks of a good housekeeper. 
There are numerous occasions when 
the use of scales is necessary, and 
there is no question but that measure- 
ment by weight could be advantage- 
ously made use of far oftener than is 
usually done at present. 

As long as the housewife is content 
to measure rather than to weigh she 
will have to expect her products to be 
lacking in uniformity for no two 
people measure exactly alike and 
probably no one person measures 
twice in the same way. But if meas- 
urements are to be persistently used, 
it is necessary that the housewife 
shall take as many precautions as pos- 
sible toward attaining a reasonable 
degree of accuracy in her work. 

AH dry ingredients, such as flour, 
meal, confectioner's and powdered 
sugar,, should be sifted before measur- 
ing. Mustard, baking powder, cream 
of tartar, soda, salt, and spices should 
be stirred to lighten and free them 
from lumps. To dip a measuring 
cup into flour or other dry material 

49 



in order to fill it and then to shake 
the cup to level its contents, con- 
denses or packs the flour and causes 
the cup to contain more than the 
recipe calls for. The material should 
be added tablespoonful by tablespoon- 
ful, taking care not to shake the cup 
until the cup is well filled. The con- 
tents should then be leveled by means 
of a case knife. 

All ingredients, measured by the 
tablespoonful or teaspoonful, are 
measured level unless otherwise 
stated. To measure a spoonful, fill 
the spoon and level it with the back 
of a case knife. For a half spoonful, 
first measure a spoonful, then divide 
it in halves, lengthwise, with a thin 
knife blade. To measure a quarter 
spoonful, first measure a half spoon- 
ful and divide it crosswise, a little 
nearer the back than the point of the 
spoon, to allow for its curvature. 
This is equivalent to one saltspoonful. 
Butter, lard, and other solid fats are 
measured by packing them solidly 
into the spoon or cup and leveling 
with a knife. Butter should be meas- 
ured before melting, unless melted 
butter is stated in the recipe, in which 
case it should be measured after melt- 
ing. 

A cup which holds half a pint, is 
the common standard of domestic 
measure. This cup has straight sides 
divided into fourths and thirds. It 
may be obtained at any good 5- and 
10-cent store or mail-order establish- 
ment. 

The following are tables of meas- 
urements, all measurements being 
level.

TIME REaUIRED FOR COOKERY 

" How long is it necessary to cook 
this article?" is a question not easily 
answered because so many factors 
enter into the problem. There is 
much variation in the size of the 
product; its age; the amount of moist- 
ure it contains, dependent upon con- 
ditions of its growth; its tenderness 
or toughness; the texture of its fibers, 
etc. 

The best of time tables therefore 
can simply act as a guide to the intel- 
ligent housewife who must temper its 
directions by her own experience. 

Closely allied to the matter of time 
for cooking is the consideration of the 
temperature which should be applied 
to various food materials. One 
might almost say that all the prob- 
lems of cookery would be solved if 
we could know more definitely than 



HOUSEHOLD WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 



51 



we do at present the exact tempera- 
ture to which each food should be sub- 
jected and the exact length of time 
to maintain it at that temperature. 
Our knowledge to-day is very incom- 
plete on these matters, and investiga- 
tions of time and temperature are 
continually being carried on in cook- 



ery laboratories. Until the subject 
of cookery has become better stand- 
ardized such tables as the following 
will undoubtedly be an aid to the 
housewife. The time will come when 
their place will be taken by much 
more definite and reliable informa- 
tion.

PRINCIPLES OF MENU MAKING 



One of the most important duties 
of the housewife is her daily menu, 
and in order to have the three meals 
each day attractive and nutritious, 
she must give careful thought to sev- 
eral fundamental considerations. 

From the standpoint of nutrition 
the question what foods may prop- 
erly be combined is of first impor- 
tance for each meal should be made 
up of foods which balance each other; 
that is, it must contain all the food 
elements that are necessary for life. 
That part of food which supplies 
nourishment and repairs waste pro- 
teid is found in meat, fish, eggs, and 
cheese; hence these foods should 
be used interchangeably, rather than 
together. Bread, potatoes, sweet 
desserts, butter, fat of meat, and 
olive oil (carbohydrates and fats) 
supply energy and heat to the body; 
while vegetables supply the necessary 
mineral matter. When green vege- 
tables are used as a salad, double 
nourishment is given since the olive 
oil used in the dressing supplies addi- 
tional fuel value. 

The selection of a well-balanced 
menu may be much facilitated by 
reference to the food maps, the nature 
and use of which is elsewhere ex- 
plained and illustrated. 

In health, a combination of foods 
in a menu which are pleasing to the 



55 



eye, and which "taste good," is a 
safe one to follow. But a menu be- 
comes uninteresting and monotonous, 
however attractive and appetizing 
the individual dishes may be, when it 
contains several dishes which pos- 
sess the same general characteristics. 
Even repetition of flavors should be 
avoided in planning a menu, for in- 
stance, tomato soup and tomato salad 
should not be served at the same 
meal. For example, the first menu 
given below would leave the family 
with a decidedly neutral taste and a 
feeling of dissatisfaction; but if it 
were changed according to sug- 
gestions given in the second, a more 
pleasing result would follow. 

Menu I 

Cream of Potato Soup 

Boiled Fish Mashed Potatoes 

Creamed Lima Beans 

Baked Custard 

Menu II 

Tomato Soup 

Boiled Fish with Hollandaise Sauce 

Fried Potatoes Spinach 

Fruit Pudding 

No doubt the cost of food is in- 
creasing, but do we ever stop to con- 
sider that poor planning and waste 



56 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



of materials are responsible for much 
of the "high cost"? The efficient 
housewife plans a weekly rather than 
a daily menu, and intelligently dis- 
tributes the money allowed for food 
among the seven days. She plans for 
each day some attractive new dish, 
takes care that left overs do not ac- 
cumulate and purchases perishable 
food when it can be used immediately. 
She watches closely the market and 
always gives the preference to sea- 
sonable foods; for when food is out 
of season it adds greatly to the meal 
budget. 

By planning ahead the housewife 
can also distribute the different 
processes of cookery so that the oven 
will not be called upon to prepare 
all the food, in one meal, while, at 
the next, the oven will be empty and 
the upper part of the stove filled with 
surface cooking. Then, too, the 
preparation of a well-planned meal 
composed partly of simple and partly 
of more elaborate dishes, is much less 
difficult, as it is almost impossible for 
one person, no matter how willing, to 
prepare several intricate courses for 
the same meal. This last point is es- 
pecially important to the woman who 
entertains without the assistance of 
a cook or maid. For the hostess 
should never be so rushed and tired 
at the moment of serving that her 
family are distressed or guests em- 
barrassed. 

The choice of food should also be 
influenced by the ages and occupa- 
tions of the various members of 
the family. Particular consideration 
should be given to each member, and 
special food provided for the young, 
growing child, the elderly person, the 
student, and the man who works in 
the open air. For example, a light, 
delicate omelet would satisfy an el- 
derly person, but it would not give 
enough energy to a hard working 
man. Griddle cakes might interfere 
with a student's digestion, since his 
sedentary work affords little oppor- 
tunity for physical exercise. 

The psychology of aesthetic appeal 
is another interesting phase of menu 
planning. Mere food as such is a 
negative consideration to many peo- 



ple, and food is often served in such 
fashion as to destroy appetite, but 
when it is served in some unusually 
attractive shape, or is artistically 
garnished in harmonious colors, a 
touch of the aesthetic is added which, 
like the delicate aromas of well- 
cooked viands, stimulates the appe- 
tite. Physicians realize the impor- 
tance of this kind of appeal, and 
skillful nurses habitually avail them- 
selves of it. An invalid can often be 
won over by a few flowers placed on 
the tray who could not be tempted 
by the food alone. 

In the menus which follow, season- 
able food has been chosen, and the 
use of left-overs from day to day 
considered. The luncheon and sup- 
per menus given can be used inter- 
changeably, with perhaps the addi- 
tion of a more substantial hot dish 
for supper. 

With the April menus, one or two 
suitable for entertaining at luncheon 
or supper are added. June being the 
month for weddings, suggestions for 
a wedding breakfast, an evening re- 
ception, and a luncheon are offered. 
August, or, in fact, any of the sum- 
mer months, make porch teas and 
suppers possible. Four menus are 
therefore given suitable for such en- 
tertainment. 

The school lunch box is important, 
since it is of supreme importance 
that the child be furnished with food 
which satisfies as well as nourishes. 
Hence several suitable combinations 
for such menus are suggested. 

The menus for the formal dinners 
have all been tested, having been pre- 
pared and served and have been found 
to be satisfactory.

MENUS FOR ENTERTAINMENTS 



There is no way in which a woman 
can entertain her friends more satis- 
factorily than by giving a well pre- 
pared luncheon or dinner, or an at- 
tractive tea or reception. The month 
of June in particular offers many 
occasions demanding such entertain- 
ments, for wedding breakfasts, lunch- 
eons for the " bride-to-be," and grad- 
uation teas and receptions are con- 
stantly occurring at this season. 

The woman who does her own work, 
or who has but one maid — and there 
a re many such — is the one for whom 
a part of these menus are prepared. 
Ihe others require more preparation, 
but any of them can easily be cooked 
by two people in the kitchen, and 
served (if necessary) by waitresses 
hired by the hour. 

The housekeeper in preparing these 
menus will gain much by systematiz- 
ing her work. Such dishes as can 
be prepared in advance and left to 
stand should be considered first, then 
those which will require immediate 
service. The menu should be plainly 
written out upon a large sheet of 
paper and posted in some conspicuous 
place in the kitchen. All dishes re- 
quired for service should be marked; 
those for hot food should be put in 
the warm oven, and those for cold 
food, in the ice box. The waitress 
will then be able to serve without 
confusion. 

Menu for Wedding Breakfast. 

Following is a simple menu for a 
wedding breakfast: 

Strawberry Cocktail 

Veal and Sweetbread Croquettes 

Pimento Sauce 

Ripe Olives Small Hot Rolls 

Cold Sliced Ham 

Hearts of Lettuce 

with French Dressing 
Individual Cupid Souffl<;s 
Coffee with Cream and Sugar 

A more elaborate menu might be 
the following: 

Chicken Broth, Supreme, in cups 
Small Bread Sticks 



Patties of Crab Meat and Mushrooms 

Broiled Lamb Chops 

Rolls New Peas 

Buttered Potato Balls 

Individual Strawberry Shortcakes 

French Cocoa 

JNIints Salted Nuts 

Menu for Bridal luncheon. 

For a bridal luncheon, the follow- 
ing menu can be served: 

Strawberries, French Style 

Lobster k la Newburgh in Ramekins 

Broiled Spring Chicken 

Asparagus Salad Rolls 

Marron Ice Cream 
Bride's Cake Coffee 

To prepare strawberries in the 
French style, large selected berries 
are washed or wiped, and the hulls 
left on. These are placed in a plate 
with a mound of powdered sugar in 
center. 

Marrons are French chestnuts done 
in sj'rup and may be bought for dif- 
ferent prices according to size of 
bottle. A sixty cent bottle would give 
enough for the ice cream for twenty 
people. Cut the chestnuts in small 
pieces, and add to the cream after it 
is frozen to a mush. Serve cream in 
glasses with a bit of beaten cream 
put through a pastry bag and tube 
on top, with one marron crowning the 
whole. 

Menu for Evening Reception.

SUGGESTIONS FOR PORCH ENTERTAINMENTS 



At a lawn party or porch tea much 
the same kind of refreshment is 
served as at an indoor reception. The 
following menus are simple, easily 
prepared, and may be served with the 
help only of daughter, friend, or 
maid. Arrange one, two or more 
small tables with flowers on each and 
the most attractive of linen, silver and 
china. The main course to be served 
may be arranged for on one table, 
with its service of silver and china. 
On the second, the beverages, with 
their service, may be arranged. On 
the third table may be placed the 
cakes, sandwiches and sweets. The 
frozen dessert may be served either 
from this or from a fourth table. 
The frapp6 in the first menu is served 
from a punch bowl into small glasses. 
This arrangement of the refreshments 
divides the service, each table being 



presided over by some friend or mem- 
ber of the family, and only one helper 
behind the scenes is needed to replen- 
ish the foods and to assist in the 
service. 

In menu No. 4, but one table is re- 
quired, and the serving may be under- 
taken by the hostess alone. As all 
of the dishes served are chilled, the 
preparations may be completed early 
in the day. Instead of punch or 
frozen ices served separately, there is 
a new and decidedly attractive mode 
of service. Partially fill the punch 
bowl with punch, then in the center, 
and at the last moment, place the 
molded water ice. The water ice 
takes the place of plain ice, and 
mingles its flavors with the punch in 
a delightful wa.v.

DIET FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN i 

The rapid development of mind 
and body in children during their 
school days demands liberal and wise- 
ly planned meals. Digestion and as- 
similation are more active at this 
period of childhood than at any other 
time during life, and as children grow 
older they require not only more food 
but a greater variety. 

The child on first entering school 
often suffers from hunger and fatigue. 
His daily life is radically changed. 

1 The following valuable siiargestions are 
offered by R. K. Bliss, director of home 
economics in Home Economics Bulletin 
No. 2, Iowa State College, Agricultural Ex- 
tension Department. 



He has certain prescribed times for 
work, and although this is not large 
in amount, more or less of a nervous 
strain is caused by the change in his 
daily habits. He must be properly 
fed for bodily growth, for energy at 
play, and for mental development. 

A school lunch, if possible, should 
be provided at least once a day. If 
all the children from the kindergarten 
to the third grade were served in the 
middle of the forenoon, the children 
would suffer less from fatigue and 
could grasp their work with less men- 
tal effort. If all were served none 
would suffer from humiliation be- 
cause of carrying a lunch to school. 
The parents could assist greatly in 
this matter if they would furnish such 
foods as crackers, bread or sand- 
wiches for lunch, which, with a cup of 
milk, would provide an abundance. 

The following daily menus are sug- 
gested :

DIET FOR ADOLESCENT CHILDREN 



While the study of food for the in- 
fant is a matter of prime importance, 
the study of foods for the adolescent 
can hardly be considered of less inter- 
est, since the foundation of physical 
ineflBciency is so often laid during that 
period (from 13 to 16 years of age). 
There is no time in the whole life 
history of the individual during which 
there is more urgent need of the ma- 
terials required to build up red blood. 
For this reason foods containing iron 
are most essential. This makes beef, 
eggs, raisins, prunes, spinach, and the 
various vegetables used for greens 
and salads of great importance in the 
diet. An ample diet consisting of the 
proper proportion of all food princi- 
ples is required to repair the wastes 
of the body, and to aid in the develop- 
ment of the new tissues. As a mat- 
ter of fact, the adolescent boy or girl 
in school or in the office or factory 
will eat quite as much as an adult 
and will be far more seriously injured 
if he eats less than he needs than will 
the adult in a similar fasting. Not 
infrequently a lunch of some kind is 
needed at half past three or four in 
the afternoon in the case of a girl. 
If she has begun to show signs of 
pallor, frequently observed in high 
school girls, let her prepare for her- 
self an egg lemonade, using two egg 
yolks in place of the yolk and white 
of one egg. Such a lunch will not in- 
terfere with her appetite for dinner, 
and should result in bringing back the 
color to her cheeks. 



The child's diet should provide a 
sufficient amount of protein, starch, 
sugar, fat, and organic salts. To this 
end it becomes the problem of the 
parents to vary the meals in such a 
way as to provide these food princi- 
ples. The tactful mother educates 
the child's taste with regard to food 
just as she educates his taste with 
regard to books, music, and recrea- 
tion. 

Farmers and stock raisers have 
known for a long time that it is abso- 
lutely necessary to make a serious 
study of the care and feeding of their 
young animals. Does not their inter- 
est teach us a lesson worth while? 

Not long ago a certain stock raiser 
said, " There are thousands of chil- 
dren in this world who are not fed as 
wisely as I feed my pigs." This state- 
ment seems a hard one but who can 
doubt its truth? 



SUGGESTIONS 

No child should go to school with- 
out breakfast. 

A light breakfast is not sufficient 
for a school child. 

A cold luncheon should be avoided 
when possible. 

Sufficient time should be allowed for 
the noon-day meal. 

Rural school children should be en- 
couraged to eat the noon lunch in a 
deliberate, orderly manner, rather 
than to take a hasty bite between the 
games of ball or marbles.

THE SCHOOL LUNCH BOX 



Many children must carry a lunch 
to school and the mother's task of 
preparing it each day is always a try- 
ing and perplexing one. In the first 
place, if one wishes to use the same 
receptacle day after day, a box of 
suitable size should be obtained. If 
it be tin, it should be well scalded 
each day, and thoroughly aired over 
night. Plenty of oiled paper and 
paper napkins should then be pro- 
vided so that the coverings can be 
thrown away when the lunch has been 
eaten. 

Every child and every young girl 
or boy is more interested in sweet 
things than in the more substantial 
foods, and contrary to the prevail- 
ing popular belief sweet foods, if of 
good quality, are not only wholesome, 
but necessary, to active youths. The 
desire for them can be satisfied by 
well chosen candies, and especially by 
sweet chocolate. These will make the 



box attractive, and will save the 
money which the child would prob- 
ably spend for sweets, and perhaps 
not wisely. 

Bread and butter either in the 
form of rolls or sandwiches; various 
fillings to vary the latter; eggs either 
hard cooked, removed from the shells, 
rolled in pepper and salt, and done 
up in oiled paper, or deviled; and a 
suitable salad, should form the hearty 
contents of lunch boxes. 

Nut bread, with dates or orange 
peel in it, and with a filling of mar- 
malade or stewed figs, makes excellent 
sandwiches. Nuts, plain or salted, 
are always appreciated, and supply 
a good deal of nourishment. Small 
cakes, cookies, or pieces of ginger- 
bread or sponge cake furnish dessert. 
Dates stuffed with cream cheese or 
nuts, or prunes stuffed with nuts and 
preserved ginger, make a dainty and 
satisfactory sweet. For five cents

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



one can buy a pretty blue cup, to be 
used as a custard mold, and a custard 
baked in this will be appreciated the 
more at lunch time on accoimt of its 
aesthetic appeal. 

Small jars such as cheese comes in 
are excellent for holding a little salad 
to be eaten with a roll. Nor should 
one forget to put in occasionally a 
pickle or a few olives. 

If one is fortunate enough to have 
a Thermos or other insulated bottle, 
hot drinks can be carried, or water, 
chilled instead of being iced. 

The same principle which governs 
the preparation of the well-balanced 
meal should govern the preparation of 
the lunch box. In addition to that we 
must consider the fact that these 
foods are packed closely together and 
must remain so packed for several 
hours before serving. This fact 
makes careful packing an urgent 
necessity, if the lunch is to be an ap- 
petizing one. 

Cake or other soft food should be 
done up in a separate piece of paper, 
and each sandwich should be wrapped 
by itself, so that each bit of food may 
have its own flavor and not be af- 
fected by its neighbor. 

Suggestive Equipment. 
Paper Napkins 
Paraffin Paper 

Porcelain or glass cup with cover 
Knife, Fork, Spoon, Plate, Cup. 

Suggestions for Packing. 

Wrap each article in paraffin paper. 
This applies particularly to sand- 



wiches, cake, cheese, or any soft, 
moist, or highly flavored food. Use 
porcelain jar for fruit, beans, cot- 
tage cheese, or similar articles. 

Suggestions for Planning. 

Protein. — Sandwiches of fish, meat, 
egg, cheese, or beans. Dish of cot- 
tage cheese, baked beans, or Lima 
beans. 

Carbohydrates. — Hot creamed po- 
tatoes, potato soup, creamed macaroni 
or rice prepared at school. Bread, 
cake, cookies, sweets in form of jelly 
or jam sandwiches, dates, figs, raisins, 
prunes, home-made candy, simple 
cakes. 

Fat. — Butter, olives, peanut butter, 
crisp dry bacon. 

Vegetables. — Lettuce, radish, cel- 
ery. 

Suggestions for Serving. 

Provide place for knife, fork, spoon, 
plate, and cup. 

Teach children to set table on their 
own desks. 

Have each child sit at his desk while 
eating. 

Have crumbs disposed of. 

Have dishes washed and placed in 
order. 

Have lunch boxes put in place. 

Advantages. 

Children eat more slowly and 
calmly than if left to themselves. 

Children learn habits of neatness. 

Children acquire a sense of respon- 
sibilitv.

CHAPTER IV 
THE ART OF CORRECT TABLE SERVICE 

THREE FORMS OF SERVICE — PRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENTS 
— LAYING THE COVERS — RULES FOR WAITRESSES — SERV- 
ICE A LA RUSSE — THE ENGLISH STYLE OF SERVICE — THE 
AMERICAN SERVICE. 



Much of the comfort, cheerfulness, 
and refinement of family life depends 
upon proper table service. Lavish- 
ness and perfection in the prepara- 
tion of food will never compensate for 
poor arrangements and poor service 
in the dining-room. The best order 
and yet the greatest freedom should 
exist. 

The way of serving meals varies 
widely, of course, in different sec- 
tions of the country and in different 
classes of society. But, in general, 
three styles of table service are in use 
in refined American homes. These 
are known as the Russian, the Eng- 
lish, and the American styles. 

The Russian style of service is the 
most formal and the most elegant. 
All food is served from the side table 
or pantry by the attendants, upon 
whom falls the entire responsibility 
of the service. Upon the table are 
placed only decorations and the in- 
dividual covers and, sometimes, such 
dishes as olives, nuts, almonds, bon- 
bons, which may very properly form 
a portion of the table decorations. 
Formal dinners and luncheons are the 
meals for which this form of service 
is best adapted. It is also used for 
all meals by those who care for form 
and have a full staff of well trained 
waitresses. It should not be carried 
out in its entirety at any meal unless 
there be at least one waitress for each 
eight persons. 

The English style of service 
breathes hospitality rather than for- 



72 



mality. It allows personal attention 
on the part of those sitting at the 
head and at the foot of the table to 
the needs of those about them. The 
food is served from the table, the 
hostess serving the soup, the salad 
and the dessert, and the host carving 
and serving the fish and roast. Place 
is found on the table for the vege- 
tables, also, which may be served by 
some one at the table or passed by 
the waitress. Except for relishes, 
bread and butter, and such articles 
of food as pertain alike to all courses, 
only one course appears at a time 
on the table. Everything pertaining 
to one course is removed before an- 
other course is served. This is the 
style of service often employed in 
homes where no servant or only one 
or two are kept. 

The American style of service is a 
combination of the Russian and the 
English styles. In some courses, the 
food (especially if it presents an at- 
tractive appearance) is served from 
the table according to the English 
custom; in other courses, the food is 
served in the Russian manner. It is 
a simpler and more home-like service 
than the Russian and somewhat more 
formal than the English. 

In deciding which of these styles 
of serving is to be used, due consid- 
eration must be given to the number 
of servants, as well as to individual 
preferences and the style best suited 
to the occasion. Likewise, the time 
that can be given to serving, and 



THE ART OF CORRECT TABLE SERVICE 



73 



clearing away a meal should be con- 
sidered. 



PRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENTS 

Whatever the style of service there 
are certain fundamental principles of 
arranging the dining-room, laying the 
table and serving the meal that ought 
to be observed in any well ordered 
home, though the decorations and 
minor services may vary and should 
have distinct individuality. 

The dining-room should be in per- 
fect order, thoroughly cleaned, prop- 
erly dusted, well lighted, well heated 
and carefully ventilated. The tem- 
perature should be about 68° F. 
Screens should be used when neces- 
sary, to shield against direct draught 
from any quarter or too generous 
blaze from an open fire. The dining- 
room table should be in the center of 
the room, if practicable. If there is 
a central light, the center of the table 
should come directly under this. The 
table should be large enough to avoid 
crowding people or dishes, but it 
should not be too large for the num- 
ber to be seated. One rule is to allow 
from twenty to thirty inches in length 
and about fifteen in depth for each 
person; another is to allow six inches 
of space between the seats of the 
chairs. Either rule gives every per- 
son abundant elbow room and affords 
ample space for serving. 

No less important than the general 
arrangement of the dining-room is 
the laying of the table. The cover- 
ing for the table is a matter of first 
consideration. It should be of as fine 
a quality as one's purse will allow. 
Every one may have clean if not fine 
table linen. Beautiful well laundered 
linen is a strong factor in making a 
table look attractive. Table cloths 
should be laundered without folds, if 
possible, save one lengthwise in the 
center of the cloth. Cloths folded in 
this way should be kept on a pole in 
a drawer, or laid in loose folds to 
avoid creasing. Where this is im- 
practicable, three lengthwise folds are 
used and the cloth is laid in the 
drawer so as to avoid cross folds. In 
regard to the use of table covers, the 



custom differs according to the meal 
to be served. It is correct to use at 
any meal a cloth that entirely covers 
the table. But for a breakfast, 
luncheon, or supper, a bare table, 
carefully polished, may be used with 
a luncheon cloth, runners, or doilies 
placed upon it. If doilies are used, 
a doily is placed where each plate is 
to be set. The doilies and the center- 
piece should be of the same pattern. 
The doily on which a hot dish is to 
be placed should have a flannel lining 
under it to preserve the polish of the 
table. 

Provided a cloth that entirely 
covers the table is to be used (as is 
customary for a dinner), the first 
proceeding in the laying of the table 
is to place a thick cloth of felt, of 
double canton flannel, or of one of 
the many thick materials that are 
made for this purpose. This cover 
not only protects a polished table but 
prevents noise in setting silver and 
china in place. A third advantage is 
that a linen cloth may be laid over 
such a cover more smoothly than over 
a bare table. When the under cloth 
is in place with the opposite edges of 
the cloth at a uniform distance from 
the floor, the linen cloth is placed 
over it. The size of the table cloth 
should be suited to the size of the 
table. One-quarter to one-third yard 
should be allowed to drop on all sides 
below the edge of the table. In plac- 
ing the cloth, let the center fold come 
exactly in the middle of the table, 
straight with the edges, with the op- 
posite edges of the cloth at equal dis- 
tances from the floor. If carving is 
to be done at the table, a carving 
cloth may be placed in the center of 
the end of the table occupied by the 
carver; likewise a tea cloth may be 
placed in the center of the end from 
which tea or coffee is to be poured by 
the hostess. 

After the cloth is laid, the center 
decorations should next be put in 
place. A center piece of linen is not 
used with a cloth of beautiful design, 
but when employed it should be 
placed exactly in the center. A vase 
of flowers, a plant, a dish or basket 
of fruit which is to be the center 



74 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



decoration of the table should be 
placed exactly in its center. The 
table decorations should be simple 
and plain, and should never obstruct 
the view across the table. If flowers 
are used, those free from objection- 
able odor and of a color to corres- 
pond with lighting arrangements or 
with the color of the food should be 
selected. Discords in color should 
be avoided, as color plays a very im- 
portant part in table service. 

The decorations vary in elaborate- 
ness with the meal served. A simple 
souvenir to be worn by the guests — 
such as a rose — may be placed in 
front of each plate or on the napkin. 
Anything in table decorations that 
goes beyond simplicity in design 
should have some element of indi- 
viduality — something appropriate to 
the day, the occasion, or the guest. 
For most occasions, aside from some 
simple floral ornament, the decora- 
tions should be fine linen, immaculate 
and well laundered, good china, well 
polished silver, and clear crystal. 
The use of candles is permissible only 
when the lighting is inadequate or the 
day is dark. At formal dinners and 
receptions candles may form part of 
the decorations. They should be 
placed artistically about the table 
with reference to the other decora- 
tions. Usually they stand near the 
corners or sides rather than near the 
center, being so placed as not to ob- 
struct the view across the table. 

The arrangement of the table in 
general and of each cover in par- 
ticular is of the utmost importance. 
There should be mathematical regu- 
larity. All articles should be syste- 
matically and regularly disposed upon 
the table. The small trays or com- 
potiers holding bonbons, transparent 
jellies, preserves, or crystallized 
fruits should be placed symmetrically 
upon the table where they will be at 
once most convenient and most ef- 
fective to the eye. Sometimes these 
are set between the candelabra, some- 
times a trifle outside the candle-sticks 
toward the edge of the table. Dishes 
of olives, celery, radishes, pickles, and 
similar esculents are sometimes placed 
upon the table, though they are, as 



are the nuts, bonbons, and relishes, 
more commonly offered at proper 
times by the waitress. They are 
often passed between courses to 
bridge delays. The table should not 
be littered with objects that belong 
on the side table. The cruets of oil 
and vinegar that properly find place 
on the family table are never used on 
formal occasions. It is then pre- 
sumed that the salad will be dressed 
and the food properly seasoned when 
served. Other condiments as mustard 
and horseradish never appear as part 
of the table appointments at a formal 
meal; they are served from the side 
table with courses that require them. 
As a general thing the host and hos- 
tess should be seated directly oppo- 
site one another and the " covers " 
arranged symmetrically on either side. 

LAYING THE COVERS 

A " cover " is the place at the table 
for each person and consists of the 
plate, napkin, glass, silver, and other 
articles needed for that particular 
meal. The plates should be placed 
with monogram or decorations in 
normal position. On formal occa- 
sions, the place plate — an elegant 
plate about ten inches in diameter — 
is the basis of each cover. This plate 
must be of dinner size and is usually 
the ordinary dinner plate. The place 
plate is placed right side up, one inch 
from the edge of the table. It is 
used only to mark the cover and is 
removed when the first course is 
placed in position. On less formal 
occasions the place plate is used as 
a service plate. The oyster plate and 
soup plate may be placed in turn 
upon it and later it is exchanged for 
the plate upon which the first hot 
course after the soup is served. At 
the simple everyday home meal a 
napkin may occupy the place between 
the knife and fork. 

The silver is placed in the order 
in which it is to be used beginning 
with that farthest from the plate. 
All silver is placed one inch from the 
edge of the table and at right angles 
to it. The knives are placed at the 
right of the plate with the cutting

edge turned inward; the spoons at the 
right with the inside of the bowl 
turned up; and the forks at the left 
with the tines up. When the fork is 
used alone, as for oysters or fruit, it 
is often placed at the extreme right. 
When the number of courses is such 
that little silver is required, all silver 
may be placed on the table before the 
meal is announced; when more than 
that placed on the table is required it 
is laid quietly with the course with 
which it is to be used. On any oc- 
casion the table is not often set with 
more than three pieces on each side 
of the plate. It is best to lay des- 
sert spoons and coffee spoons by the 
plate or on the saucer at the time of 
serving. All silver should be kept at 
an equal distance from the edge of 
the table, on a line with the plate and 
napkin. The napkin is simply folded 
and laid at the left of the forks if 
there is space; otherwise, on the place 
or service plate; if this plate is in 
use, the napkin is laid between the 
knives and forks. The hem and sel- 
vage of the napkin should be parallel 
with the forks and the edges of the 
table. Napkins are sometimes given 
additional folds to save space. The 
napkin should be of the same pattern 
as the cloth and in size suitable to 
the meal to be served. The dinner 
napkin — serviette — should be folded 
in a large square, the monogram cor- 
ner uppermost and the right side up. 

The glasses are placed at the right 
hand of the plate near the tip of the 
knife. They are placed in the order 
of size, the tallest being to the left. 
Glasses are turned up, not down. At 
dinners in America, water is invari- 
ably used and very often apollinaris 
or other sparkling table water added. 
When both are served a goblet is 
placed for the water and a small 
tumbler of clear thin glass for the 
other. When water alone is served, 
a tumbler is usually placed to con- 
tain it. 

Bread and Butter. — At formal din- 
ners and luncheons where butter is 
not usually served, the butter plate 
does not appear. When butter is 
served, a small butter plate or a bread 
and butter plate is placed at the tip 



of the fork but slightly to the left. 
The bread and butter spreader may 
be placed at the right with the other 
knives, at the side of the butter plate, 
or across the right hand side of the 
bread and butter plate with the blade 
turned toward the center of the plate. 

Though bread is not always served 
on formal occasions, sometimes a roll, 
a bread stick or a square of bread cut 
two inches thick is either laid upon 
the napkin or slipped between the 
folds of the napkin. 

Condiments. — Open individual salt 
cellars are not widely used at present, 
but when used should be placed with 
a small spoon for each at the top of 
each plate. Salt and pepper shaker 
sets may be placed between each two 
covers or at the corners or sides where 
they may be used by several people. 
At formal meals no salt or pepper is 
placed on the table, the assumption 
being that the food is so perfectly 
seasoned that their use will not be 
required. 

At the formal dinner or luncheon, 
tiny dishes of salted almonds are 
sometimes placed at every cover, to 
the left of the plate near "the tips of 
the forks or just in front of the plate. 
But these are often served in larger 
bonboniers and may be placed on the 
table or passed from the side table. 

All articles pertaining to one cover 
should be placed as close together as 
possible without having the pieces 
touch or appear crowded. The whole 
table has a neater appearance if the 
cover is compact, not loosely spread. 

Place Cards and Menu Cards. — 
At formal dinners the place card is 
often used for convenience in seating 
the guest — a simple plain card of 
best quality inscribed in the hostess' 
own hand across the length with the 
name of the person for whom the seat 
is intended. These cards may have 
in the upper left hand corner, or in 
the center, the monogram, or initials 
of the hostess, or a dainty painting. 
They are placed upon the napkins. 

Menu cards are seldom used at 
small dinners. On special occasions 
they are sometimes designed to serve 
as souvenirs. The place card may on 
such occasions serve a double purpose 



76 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



by having the menu on the reverse 
side. Menu cards should be placed 
upon the napkins. 

The chairs are placed after the 
table has been laid, the front of the 
chair on a line with the edge of the 
table so that the line of the cloth 
will not be broken. The chair should 
be close enough so that it does not 
have to be moved nearer the table 
after one is seated. 

Any additional china, silver, or 
glass that tiie courses may call for 
should be at hand. The side board 
was used formerly to hold many of 
these articles. The serving table has 
taken its place while the side board is 
used more for decorative purposes, 
usually holding a few choice pieces of 
silver. However, cold food, such as 
bread, butter, cream, sugar, carafe, 
or pitcher of water, olives, bonbons, 
and nuts, may be placed on the side- 
board, if these do not appear on the 
table and there is not room on the 
side table for them. 

The side table should be laid with 
care. Extra silver and napkin, like 
that pertaining to an individual cover 

— to be used in case of an emergency, 
such as the accidental dropping of a 
fork or overturning a glass of water 

— are placed on the table. Any other 
extra china, glass, serving silver or 
cutlery which may be required is 
ready on the side table or buffet or 
on a table in the pantry. The napkin 
and tray to be used for crumbing is 
placed on the side table. Napkins for 
handling hot plates and dishes should 
be at hand here. If a serving-tray is 
used, room should be left on the table 
for it. On informal occasions, salad, 
dessert, coffee cups and saucers and 
the finger bowls resting on small 
plates may be placed on the side table 
or sideboard in order to facilitate 
the service. 

In the pantry there should be table 
space to lay out relays of knives, 
forks, spoons, china, and glass. 
There should also be a table upon 
which to serve the soup and the meat 
if this is done in the pantry. If the 
soup and meat are served from the 
buffet, plates, serving dishes, and sil- 
ver are placed there as required for 



each course. Dishes needed for cold 
food should be put where they will 
become chilled; and those needed for 
hot food, placed to warm. The suc- 
cess of a meal depends much upon 
the strict observance of this rule. 

RULES FOR WAITRESSES 

A few established rules relative to 
the personal appearance and general 
duties of those in attendance may be 
mentioned here. Careful attention to 
these matters is an extremely im- 
portant factor in the successful serv- 
ing of a formal meal and is never neg- 
lected by a competent hostess. Ab- 
solute cleanliness of person and dress 
on the part of the attendants should 
be required under all circumstances. 
Hands and nails should be faultlessly 
clean. When serving dinner, a wait- 
ress wears a plain black gown with 
white collar and cuffs and a dainty 
white apron, unless it is the wish of 
her mistress that her dress be white. 
A cap may be worn but the custom 
is not so general as formerly. A 
butler when serving dinner wears 
complete livery with a white tie 
and without gloves. All attendants 
should be required to wear shoes hav- 
ing soles of thin leather, felt or rub- 
ber that will not creak in order that 
their tread may be absolutely noise- 
less. 

SuflBcient help is essential if a for- 
mal meal is to be served. A well 
trained waitress, seconded by a cook, 
with whom she works harmoniously, 
can serve a meal to six people with 
ease and celerity. With a larger 
number of covers there should be an 
extra maid in the pantry to clear 
away the dishes or in the dining-room 
to assist with the serving. An ef- 
ficient waitress must not only be quick 
and skillful in handling dishes and 
serving food, but she must know just 
what to do and when to do it. She 
should be alert and observing and 
should perform her duties in such a 
manner that the service will be 
prompt, orderly and unobtrusive. 
Plates should always be handled with- 
out clatter. One plate should never 
be placed upon another for conven-

ience, in removal, even at less formal 
meals, nor should a waitress carry 
piles of plates in her hands and dis- 
tribute them about the table. Soiled 
dishes should not be allowed to ac- 
cumulate upon the side table, but 
should be removed promptly from the 
dining room. 

When a dish containing food is 
passed by the waitress, the dish is 
placed on a napkin on the palm of 
the left hand. The napkin is not used 
when placing or exchanging plates or 
in removing the table dishes contain- 
ing food. The serving silver is placed 
on the dish in a position convenient to 
be served; this silver should be ar- 
ranged at the side table, not as the 
dish is being presented. Two pieces 
of silver arranged at either end of the 
dish are essential in most cases for 
the best service. The serving dish 
should be held firmly and low and 
near the person to be served. It 
should be held in the left hand and if 
too heavy for one hand, steadied with 
the right hand on the edge of the dish. 
The waitress should stand slightly 
back and to the left of the person 
served when passing food. 

Before a meal is announced, all 
doors and drawers should be closed, 
all shades properly drawn and all can- 
dles lighted. All food pertaining to 
the first course should be ready to 
serve. At informal meals the first 
course may be placed on the table. 
The water glasses may be filled be- 
fore the meal is announced or just 
after the guests are seated. At less 
formal meals the carafes or water 
pitchers are kept filled upon the side 
table, the waitress being trained to 
replenish the glass. If apoUinaris or 
other aerated water is served, the 
small tumbler to contain it stands 
empty; for effervescent waters are not 
poured until after the guests are 
seated. Glasses are filled three-quar- 
ters full — never to the brim. 

A formal meal is always annoimced 
by the waitress in person. In an- 
nouncing the meal, the waitress ap- 
pears at the door of the drawing- 
room and stands in silence for her 
mistress to recognize her; or she may 
say " Dinner is served." Other meals 



are announced according to the pref- 
erence of the hostess, sometimes by 
the Japanese gong, sometimes by per- 
sonal announcement. 

As has been explained, the style of 
service varies according to the formal- 
ity of the meal and the individual 
preferences of the host and hostess. 
A description of the style of service, 
for more formal meals will be given 
first and remarks regarding the less 
formal styles will follow. 

SERVICE A LA RUSSE 

For a ceremonious dinner the Rus- 
sian style is commonly used. It per- 
mits of two methods of serving. 
Either the food is arranged on in- 
dividual plates and placed before each 
person, or the plates are placed, 
empty, for the successive courses and 
all food is passed, the food being at- 
tractively arranged on suitable dishes 
from which each person helps himself. 

The menu is divided into courses 
that succeed each other according to 
a conventional order. It is good 
taste not to have too many. Five or 
six courses are regarded as sufficient; 
eight, as adequate; and most hos- 
tesses advise against the serving of 
more than ten courses in any circum- 
stances. The order of courses is 
usually as follows: A first course of 
oysters or clams on the half shell or 
canapes of sardines, caviar, or some 
other light relish; or of fruit such as 
grape fruit, strawberries or melon 
according to locality and season; or 
the dinner may begin with a soup. 
This is followed by the fish, an entree, 
roast and vegetables, sorbet, game, 
and salad, an entree of cheese or 
vegetables, hot dessert, ice-cream, 
fruit, nuts, bonbons, and coffee. 

A discussion as to the way these 
courses may be served at a large and 
ceremonious dinner will suggest the 
way a meal may be served when 
fewer courses constitute the menu. 

The Shell Fish. — After the guests 
are seated and have removed their 
napkins, the waitress takes up the 
place-plates and puts down a plate 
holding the first course of fruit or 
oysters. These are in their re- 



78 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



spective dishes which rest on a serv- 
vice plate; both plates together are 
placed in position on the table. To 
expedite the service, they may be ar- 
ranged on the side table just before 
the dinner is announced; or it is per- 
missible for the waitress to bring two 
plates of food at a time to the dining- 
room, placing one on the serving 
table and the other on the dining- 
table, and returning to the serving 
table for the second plate rather than 
to the pantry, thus saving steps and 
time. All plates are removed and 
placed one by one, the waitress taking 
up with the left hand the plate to be 
removed and with the right hand 
slipping a fresh plate into the vacant 
place. No cover is left at any time 
throughout a formal dinner without 
a plate except when the table is 
cleared for the dessert. Sometimes a 
place-plate is exchanged for the soiled 
plate and this plate removed when 
the next course arranged on indi- 
vidual plates is placed. When the 
guests have finished the first course, 
the oyster plates are removed; the 
service plates left in position. On 
these the soup plates are placed. 

The Soup Course. — Before the 
soup is served, the soup tureen, soup 
plates, and soup ladle should be laid 
in order on the side table in the din- 
ing room or pantry and here the soup 
is served, a ladleful or half ladleful 

— according to the size of the ladle 

— being given to each guest, the soup 
plates never being more than half 
full. If the soup is served from the 
pantry, the waitress may bring in 
two plates of soup and proceed as in 
the first course. The bread sticks or 
other SOU]) accompaniments are next 
passed. The most important accom- 
paniments of a course are always 
passed first and the others in the 
order of their importance. 

At the conclusion of the soup 
course, all the soup plates are re- 
moved. When a course of hors 
d'oeuvre — celery, radishes, olives, 
and salted nuts — follows, the place 
plates are left in position and these 
relishes are passed. Otherwise, the 
place plates are removed with the 
soup plates upon them, and warm, 
flat plates for the fish are set down. 



The Fish Course. — The fish may 
be disposed on a large platter, the 
whole attractively garnished, or it 
may be arranged in individual por- 
tions on the plates. Should the fish 
be small, one or more are placed on 
each plate; otherwise, a small portion 
of fish is served. A sauce is com- 
monly passed with the fish, together 
with potatoes cooked in some dainty 
fashion. In addition, cucumber salad 
is frequently served with the fish, in 
which case it is either placed directly 
upon the plate with the fish or upon 
small plates placed to receive it. 
After the fish has been disposed of, 
the plates are taken away and warm 
plates for the entree placed. 

The Entree. — The entries are 
served from the pantry or side table 
usually in individual forms such as 
pastry shells. A sauce is either 
served on the plate or handed at the 
left in order that each guest may help 
himself. 

The apoUinaris is poured just 
before the roast is served. 

The Roast and Vegetables. — The 
fresh warm dinner plates for the 
roast displace those on which the 
entree was served. The carving is 
done in the pantry. The roast is then 
placed on a platter containing slices 
both rare and well done, so arranged 
that the guests may readily help 
themselves to the kind preferred. A 
single vegetable may accompany the 
roast. More than two vegetables are 
very rarely served. One vegetable 
may be arranged on the platter with 
the meat or both may be brought in 
in vegetable dishes and passed, each 
guest taking a helping on the plate 
with the meat. A single waitress 
passes the roast to all guests and then 
retraces her steps to pass the vege- 
tables in the same order as that in 
which she passed the meat. Two 
waitresses may perform the same 
duties on opposite sides of the table 
or one may pass the roast and the 
other follow closely with the vege- 
table. The roast and vegetables are 
often served in the pantry. A plate 
containing portions of these is then 
placed before each guest. 

The sorbet. — Which is a frozen 
punch or ice — is served after the 



THE ART OF CORRECT TABLE SERVICE 



79 



roast. This course is served in a sher- 
bet glass on a small plate with a doily 
between, and a small spoon. These 
are always arranged in the pantry; a 
heaping tablespoonful of sorbet is 
sufScient for each glass. The plates 
containing the roast are removed as 
the sorbet is placed. 

Laying Additional Silver. — The 
knives, forks, and spoons used at 
each course are removed on the plates 
and — unless a complete cover has 
been laid — fresh ones should be 
brought when those originally sup- 
plied have been used. This fresh 
silver should be placed from a napkin 
on the hand or from a tray just be- 
fore or just after the plate is placed. 
But when rapid service is desired or 
when a dinner of many courses is 
served (especially with such courses 
as sorbet, salad, dessert and coffee), 
it is permissible to bring in the fresh 
silver on the plate on which the 
course is served. 

Silver should always be put down 
from the right. A knife and fork 
are not put down side by side. The 
fork is placed at the left of the cover 
and the knife at the right. If a fork 
alone is to be used, as for salad, it 
is placed at the right. When the 
hostess' supply of china or silver is 
limited the articles first used are 
washed in the pantry and brought in 
again when needed. This is the duty 
of the maid who helps in the pantry; 
it must never be left to those who 
wait upon the table, as this would 
delay the service. 

The Game and Salad. — After the 
sorbet cups and plates have been 
taken away, warm plates are placed 
for the game. Venison is carved and 
served from the pantry, or side table 
and handled in all respects the same 
as the roast. Poultry and game birds 
are carved and served on warm plat- 
ters. In case of chicken and turkey, 
both dark and light meat should be 
so disposed that each guest may select 
either or both. Small game or birds 
are served in the pantry or from the 
side table. 

When the salad is served with the 
game it may either be upon plates 
containing the game or passed from 
the left, each guest helping himself 



directly upon a small plate laid for 
that purpose to the left of each cover 
before the salad is offered; or it may 
be served from the side table on sep- 
arate plates and placed at the left of 
each person. Should a vegetable be 
served with the game, however, the 
salad follows, constituting with cheese 
and wafers a separate course. Cold 
plates are used for the salad to keep 
it crisp. In removing this course, 
the waitress takes the salad plate and 
then the game plate. W^hen salad is 
served with the game, cheese may be 
served as a separate course after the 
game. Such a course of cheese is 
often served as savories, being ar- 
ranged on individual plates and 
placed before the guests after the 
game plates are removed. 

Clearing the Table. — Before the 
dessert is brought in, the table is 
cleared and crumbed. With the ex- 
ception of the glasses, everything in 
front of each guest should be re- 
moved. At less formal meals the 
table is likewise cleared; relishes, 
bread and butter plates, salts and 
peppers which may have been upon 
the table are removed. Only the 
nuts, bonbons, decorations and illum- 
inations are left in place. Any 
crumbs are removed with a napkin 
on to a small plate. The goblets are 
filled with water and the dessert is 
then brought in. 

The Hot Dessert. — At a formal 
dinner, a hot dessert (often omitted 
to shorten the meal) may precede a 
frozen cream or ice. It is usually 
arranged on individual plates and 
placed from the right. 

The Ice. — After the removal of 
the hot dessert, the ice-cream is next 
served. If in individual molds, it is 
placed before the guest; if in a large 
mold, it is passed, the cold ice-cream 
plates having been placed as the 
plates of the preceding course were 
removed. 

The Finger Bowl Service. — As the 
ices are removed, the finger bowl 
service is placed. This consists of a 
plate of dessert size with doily in its 
center and the finger bowl which 
rests on the doily. The bowl should 
be about one-third full of tepid water 
and may contain a very thin slice of 



80 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



lemon, or a sweet scented leaf or 
small blossom. If a course follows 
for which a spoon or a knife is needed 
one or both may be placed on the 
plate, one on each side if both are 
used. The guest will remove the 
bowl, doily and silver before the next 
course is offered. The bowl and 
doily are placed to the left of the 
plate; the silver is laid in position 
at the sides. 

The Fruit, Nuts and Bonbons. — 
A dish of fruit is i)assed after the 
finger bowls have been removed and, 
sometimes, is afterwards placed on 
the table. Grapes should be accom- 
panied with grape scissors by means 
of which clusters are clipped from 
the stem. After the fruit, nuts and 
raisins with bonbons are frequently 
passed. Instead of fruit, a course of 
cheese and wafers may be offered if 
a similar course has not been served 
earlier in the meal. 

The Coffee. — Coffee in small cups — 
demi-tasse — is now brought in and 
set down from the right, and sugar 
on a small tray is passed to the 
left of each guest. Cream may 
be offered though few people take it. 
Coffee is sometimes served from the 
table; the complete coffee service 
being brought to the table and set be- 
fore the hostess. Often, however, at 
formal dinners, coffee is served to the 
men in the dining-room after the 
women have withdrawn and to the 
latter separately in the drawing- 
room. Or, it may be served to the 
men and to the women together in 
the drawing-room. In either of the 
latter cases, the coffee service may be 
placed before the hostess who pours 
and the coffee passed by a waitress; 
or, if preferred, all the cups filled 
may be placed on a large tray with 
sugar bowl, sugar tongs, and creamer 
and the tray passed. Another way 
to serve coffee is as follows: One 
waitress passes a tray containing the 
coffee cups — a coffee spoon lying on 
each saucer — and a sugar bowl and 
creamer; another follows with a silver 
coffee pot upon a tray and pours the 
coffee for each guest. 

Coffee in large cups is served with 
the meals only at family meals or 
similar informal occasions. 



THE ENGLISH STYLE OF SERVICE 

The service of a meal after the Rus- 
sian style requires one or more people 
to be constantly busy attending to the 
orderly progression of tlie courses. 
The mistress of a home who wishes 
to have a meal served after this 
fashion, but who does not have the 
necessary servants must employ extra 
help. For company dinners in small 
households, therefore, as for ordinary 
meals, the English or American style 
of service is used. The host who can 
skillfully carve and the hostess who 
understands the art of serving, need 
not hesitate to entertain in one of 
these fashions, from fear that their 
hospitality will be less acceptable 
than that characterized by the formal 
service. A meal of few courses may 
be cooked and served by the hostess 
herself as acceptably, in every re- 
spect, as if prepared and served by 
trained helpers. But for a meal that 
makes any pretense of formality, at 
least one maid is required in order 
that the hostess may not be obliged 
to leave the table to wait upon her 
guests. If onl3' one maid is in at- 
tendance the menu should be simple 
and the number of courses few. 
When a meal is served after the Eng- 
lish style, the duties of the maid are 
to bring the food to the table, to re- 
move all soiled dishes from the table, 
to pass the plates containing indi- 
vidual portions, to offer, at proper 
time the vegetables, relishes, etc. 
The maid should stand back of the 
carver, and she should take each plate 
as it is served and place it before 
the person for whom it is intended. 
If a sauce or vegetables are to be 
served with any course she should 
offer them as promptly as possible. 
In order to lighten the work of serv- 
ing it is customary not only to place 
bonbons, and salted nuts upon the 
table but also to add at proper in- 
tervals the accessories of the various 
courses. These accompaniments of 
courses the maid may pass or allow 
the guests to help themselves at the 
invitation of the hostess. 

Whether the dinner begins with 
shell fish or fruit, the first course may 
be served in all respects the same 



THE ART OF CORRECT TABLE SERVICE 



81 



as on a more ceremonious occasion. 
If the dinner begins with soup a cov- 
ered soup tureen is placed in front 
of the cover of the hostess. The soup 
ladle is laid at the right of the soup 
tureen. A pile of warm soup plates 
may be placed at the right or left 
of the hostess' cover if space is ade- 
quate, or these may be in position on 
the serving table. As soon as every 
one is seated the maid removes the 
tureen cover and places the ladle in 
the soup. If the soup plates are on 
the side table the maid takes one and 
places it before the hostess. A fresh 
soup-plate is placed when the one 
filled is removed. If the plates are 
beside the hostess' cover, it is the 
custom for the hostess to place the 
plate in position before serving the 
soup. The maid passes the plates of 
soup as served by the hostess, one at 
a time, precisely as above directed 
for the Russian service. As it is not 
customary to offer a second serving 
of soup — except at a family dinner 
— the maid should re-cover and re- 
move the soup tureen as soon as the 
soup and its accompaniments have 
been served. After every one has 
finished with the course, the maid re- 
moves the soup and service plates and 
brings to the side table the dinner 
plates, the vegetables, and the roast. 

The roast is placed directly in 
front of the cover of the host. The 
carving knife and serving spoon are 
placed at the right of the platter and 
the carving fork at the left. The 
warm dinner plates may be placed 
as were the soup plates. The maid 
places one plate containing a portion 
of the roast while the carver is pre- 
paring another. 

After the roast has been served, the 
maid takes the vegetables from the 
side table, passes them and returns 
them, covered, to their former posi- 
tion. The vegetables and roast are 
left in place until all have finished in 
order that second helpings may be 
served if desired. The platter con- 
taining the roast is removed with the 
carving set and serving spoon upon 
it. If frozen punch follows the roast, 
it is served as for the formal dinner. 
Game and fowl, if any, are served in 
precisely the same manner as the 



roast. Salad may be served with 
game or may constitute a separate 
course. In either case, a salad may 
be prepared in advance and kept in 
a cool place until required, or a large 
salad bowl and necessary ingredients 
may be set before the hostess in order 
that she may prepare and dress the 
salad at the table. She may then 
serve the portions on plates brought 
to her by the maid. These are placed 
before the guests. At the small din- 
ner, salad often constitutes a separate 
course. The salad may be served as 
above or the salad plates may be 
placed as the dinner plates are re- 
moved. The bowl of salad is placed 
upon the table before the hostess. 
The plate before her is filled and this 
exchanged for the plate at the cover 
of the one first served. This in turn 
is filled and so on. Cheese and 
wafers may be passed. As the des- 
sert, puddings, ice-cream and the like, 
are usually served by the hostess, cake 
is either passed by the maid and 
finally set upon the table, or placed 
upon the table in the first place and 
passed by the guests. After the des- 
sert, the hostess passes the bonbons. 
Coffee may either be poured by the 
hostess at the table or served in the 
living room; but usually for dinners 
served after the English fashion, the 
men and women take their coffee to- 
gether in the dining-room. Other- 
wise, when a simple dinner is given, 
the maid in attendance follows the 
custom for a formal dinner as though 
the Russian service was used. 

THE AMERICAN SERVICE 

In our American homes, the com- 
bination of the two forms — the Rus- 
sian and the English forms — is wide- 
ly used, especially for small dinners 
and luncheons. When this form (pre- 
viously designated as the American 
style of service) is used, such dishes 
as present an attractive appearance 
are served from the table after the 
fashion of the English; in other 
courses, the food, in dishes from 
which each guest helps himself, is 
passed or arranged in individual por- 
tions and placed by the waitress ac- 
cording to the Russian form. 



8^ 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



A meal may be prepared and 
served without a maid. Families 
with average incomes find service 
without a maid imperative. When a 
woman has all the work of the home 
to do, she must consider how she may 
conserve her health and energy. The 
menu, therefore, must be simple and 
consideration must be given to the 
details of service before the meal is 
begun. Even if the service is simple 
it is of the greatest importance to 
have the table clean and dainty in ap- 
pearance. In laying the table, special 
pains should be taken to provide 
everything necessary, that there may 
be as little occasion as possible for 
leaving the table. The carving cloth 
and carving set, if to be used, should 
be in place; also sufficient silver for 
each dish to be served. The vinegar 
and oil cruets and relishes, if served, 
may be placed when the table is laid. 
Bread and butter plates may be 
placed on the table. The use of 
bread and butter plates is not neces- 
sary but gives a daintier service than 
if the butter is placed on a hot plate. 
Butter may be neatly cut and placed 
on a plate on the table, likewise 
bread. A pitcher of ice-water may 
be placed on the table near some 
member of the family who will re- 
plenish the glasses. If a hot bev- 
erage is to be served during the meal, 
sugar and cream together with the 
cups and saucers may be on the table 
before the family are seated. All 



foods which need not be served very 
hot or very cold may be placed on 
the dining table or on the serving 
table. Food on the serving table 
may be covered with a napkin until 
required. The style of serving is 
necessarily simple. For this kind of 
service, it is not practicable to carry 
out all the rules observed by a wait- 
ress. One who must prepare and 
serve a meal should not be expected 
to take additional steps for the sake 
of form. Therefore, for this kind of 
serving it is allowable to dispense 
with the place plate, to remove two 
plates at a time, etc.; the leading 
principle is to dispense with that 
which is unnecessary. A small tray 
or serving wagon at the right or left 
of the hostess is very convenient. 
Children should be permitted and 
taught to help with the serving. 
They should have daily share in such 
duties as filling the glasses, passing 
food, arranging for the change of 
courses and the like. The one who 
sits near the carver may serve the 
vegetables that are to be on the same 
plate with the meat and thus save 
time and confusion in passing them. 
Sometimes the making of a beverage 
at the table or the cooking of an arti- 
cle in the chafing dish will give 
variety and add a charm to the meal 
as well as simplify the service, es- 
pecially when breakfast or supper is 
the meal to be served.

Catering or marketing — i.e., the 
selection and purchase of food stuffs 
for the table — is most often con- 
sidered, in the ordinary American 
household, primarily from the stand- 
point of convenience. The house- 
wife's choice of meat, fish, and other 
perishable food stuffs that form the 
principal part of the daily meals is 
usually determined by the resources 
of the grocer or butcher that she 
patronizes. And in most parts of the 
country orders for the day's supplies 
are given to a clerk who calls upon 
the housewife to receive them, or 
given direct to the tradesman over 
the telephone, the selection being, as 
a rule, intrusted wholly to the latter's 
discretion. Within recent years, how- 
ever, as a result of scientific study of 
foods, and of popular instruction in 
the subject in cooking schools and 
other institutions, the wholesome old- 
fashioned custom of going to market 
and selecting in person one's meats, 
fish, vegetables, and other supplies, 
has been quite generally revived, and 
the lore of the market has resumed, 
to a great extent, the place that it 
formerly occupied as among the fash- 
ionable accomplishments of our grand- 
mothers. 



83 



To know how intelligently to select, 
every day in the year, the best that 
the market affords, is of far greater 
importance, both from the standpoint 
of the physical well-being of the fam- 
ily, and from that of conserving the 
family income, than is commonly sup- 
posed. Yet many women in their 
everyday routine are very careless 
and indifferent concerning these mat- 
ters. But every housekeeper becomes 
more or less solicitous concerning her 
catering upon occasion of giving a 
breakfast, luncheon, or dinner-party, 
or even a family meal to which guests 
are to be entertained. The instinct 
of hospitality impels most persons to 
feel that nothing is too good for the 
invited guest; yet the best intentions 
of the housekeeper who habitually 
entrusts the choice of meats, poultry, 
and game to the butcher, and of vege- 
tables to the green-grocer, are often 
unhappily defeated by the dealer's 
carelessness or by her own inability 
in an emergencj^ to recognize the best, 
so as to insist upon having it. Every 
woman, out of regard for the welfare 
of her family, should do her own 
marketing. But certainly the woman 
who entertains should cultivate this 
practice and the nice skill in catering

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



that it gives, will add immeasurably 
to the success of her dinner-parties 
and other entertainments. 

The Selection of Meats. — Not many 
houseliecpcrs give enough thought to 
the characteristics of tlie various cuts 
of meat resulting from their natural 
relation to the living animal. Indeed, 
the cook or the carver who knows just 
what part of the living animal is rep- 
resented by the piece before him, or 
what relation the bone in a steak or 
roast sustains to the animal's skeleton, 
is doubtless the very rare exception. 
Yet nothing could be simpler than to 
familiarize oneself with the various 
cuts of meat, as exemplified in the ac- 
compan)'ing plates, or to identify these 
u])on the butcher's counter, indeed, 
any housekeeper can readily arrange, 
by apjiointment with the butcher, to be 
at iiand when the latter is cutting up a 
side of beef, veal, mutton, or pork, 
and thus receive without expense a 
practical demonstration of the art of 
meat cutting. 

The method of cutting the various 
sides of meat has been described 
elsewhere. It is suflBcient in this place 
to discuss the special characteristics 
by which the best grades of meat may 
be recognized when marketing, and 
the qualities of the various cuts from 
the standpoint of catering, especially 
for dinner-parties and other enter- 
tainments. 

Full directions for cooking the vari- 
ous meats and meat dishes are also 
given elsewhere but it seems desirable 
to give in this connection certain 
suggestions of special interest to the 
woman who entertains. 

METHODS OF COOKING JOINTS, 
POULTRY, AND GAME 

There are three typical methods of 
cooking meat: first, by the application 
of intense heat to keep in the juices, 
as by roasting, baking, or broiling; 
second, by placing the meat in cold 
water and cooking for a long time at 
a low temperature, i.e. boiling: and, 
third, by a combination of the two 
processes, first searing, and then after- 
wards stewing the meat. The first 
method is suitable only for tlie most 
tender cuts, young poultry, and game 



birds, and as these are the kinds of 
meat most often selected for meals 
at which company is to be entertained, 
the processes of roasting, baking, and 
broiling, and the kinds of meat, poul- 
try, and game that are best adapted 
to these methods of cookery are of 
chief interest in this connection. 

Cooks recognize a distinction be- 
tween roasting and baking. The word 
roasting, properly speaking, applies 
to the old-fashioned method of cook- 
ing by the direct radiant heat from 
the open fire; whereas baking is 
cooking by heat reflected by the sides 
of the oven. The older method of 
roasting is now very little practiced 
in private houses, and the term roast- 
ing is now most often improperly ap- 
plied to baking in an oven. The rules 
for the treatment of the meat, how- 
ever, are substantially the same in 
both cases, and the two processes 
therefore may properly be dealt with 
together. 

Meat which is to be roasted should 
never be washed, but only wiped over 
on the outside with a clean, damp 
cloth. For roasting in the older sense 
of the term, it should then be hung 
on the roasting spit or hook. For 
baking it should be set on the trivet 
or meat stand, and placed in a drip- 
ping-pan large enough to project 
two or three inches all around it. 
The modern double dripj^ing-pan, 
having a close-fitting cover, with a 
vent to allow the escape of gases and 
steam from the meat juices is in- 
finitely superior to the old-fashioned 
single pan, and the purchase of at 
least two such pans — one of about 
8 inches for small roasts, game birds, 
and the like; and one of about 18 
inches for large joints, roasting 
chicken and turkey — is to be earn- 
estly recommended to every house- 
wife. 

A very essential point in roasting 
or baking meat properly is to expose 
the joint or bird for the first few 
minutes to a very high temperature 
to sear the surface and thereby 
harden the albumen on the outside 
so as to prevent the escape of the 
meat juices, and tlien to lower the 
temperature and keep it at a sub- 
stantially lower point for the remain- 



CATERING, COOKING AND CARVING 



85 



der of the time that the joint requires 
for roasting or baking, with the object 
of preventing a similar hardening of 
the albumen in the interior of the 
meat. The proper temperature for a 
large piece of meat at the beginning 
is about 550 degrees, but after the 
surface is well browned, the tempera- 
ture should be dropped to about 400 
degrees, and kept at this point until 
the process is finished. To accomplish 
this, a roast of meat should be hung 
close to the fire, and meat to be baked 
should be placed in the hottest part 
of the oven, until the surface is thor- 
oughly browned. Then it should be 
drawn back or moved to a cooler part 
of the oven. If a gas oven is being 
used, the gas should be turned on 
full, in advance, and allowed to burn 
about ten minutes. Then it may be 
turned down slightly to reduce the 
temperature. In the absence of an 
oven thermometer the cook, must of 
course learn by experiment the proper 
management of her own oven. 

Basting and Larding. — Meat, while 
being cooked, whether by roasting or 
baking, must be often basted, i.e., the 
melted fat which has run from it 
must be poured over its surface with 
a spoon or ladle, to prevent the roast 
from drying out or burning. In 
order to insure that there may be 
suflBcient dripping for this purpose, 
the cook must take notice whether 
the meat has enough fat; otherwise a 
little additional fat should be put in 
the pan, and also upon the top of 
the roast. Lean joints of meat, or 
poultry, game, and the like — which 
have no natural fat on the outside — 
should be larded by having slices of 
fat bacon laid over them and tied 
tightly with a cord to protect the 
meat from browning too rapidly. Or 
a piece of buttered paper may be used 
for this purpose, which may be taken 
off during the last fifteen minutes so 
that the surface may become brown. 
Larding is usually necessary for thick 
pieces only. Meat roasting before an 
open fire requires frequent basting, 
at intervals of about ten minutes. 
Meat baking in the oven — except for 
very small pieces — requires basting 
only about half as often, or at inter- 
vals of twenty minutes. 



How Long to Cook a Roast. — 
Some experience is required to deter- 
mine when a roast is sufficiently done. 
The inexperienced cook should con- 
sult the Complete Time Table, else- 
where given. But one must also con- 
sider that the time required depends 
upon the weight and the quality of 
the roast. As a general rule, a thick 
piece of beef requires fifteen minutes 
to the pound, and fifteen minutes 
over. A similar piece of pork or veal 
will require twenty minutes to the 
pound, and fifteen minutes over; 
poultry, fifteen minutes to the pound. 

With a little experience, the cook 
should be able to tell when the meat 
is done by pressing with the finger 
upon the outside. If the roast is 
well done, the outside will recover 
slowly from the pressure of the finger. 
If done, it will rebound at once. If 
overdone, it will scarcely yield at 
all. 

Broiling. — Broiling, like roasting, 
is cooking by the direct rays of the 
fire but, unlike roasting, it is adapted 
to small and thin pieces of meat, 
such as chops, steak, chicken, and 
smaller game birds. The whole of the 
cooking is accomplished by sharp heat 
applied to the outside, but so regu- 
lated as to allow the outside to be 
hardened while the inside is being 
gently cooked. To accomplish per- 
fect broiling, some care and experi- 
ence are required, and lack of care 
and judgment many times causes fail- 
ure in broiling, the meat being either 
tough and dry or underdone. In 
cooking on the grill, the state of the 
fire must be taken into consideration. 
The coals must be glowing, without 
smoke or flame. Should flame arise, 
a few drops of cold water sprinkled 
over the coals will cause them to sub- 
side. For broiling by gas, the gas 
must be lighted long enough in ad- 
vance to radiate a strong heat, both 
over and under the grill. The grill 
must be greased with suet or pieces 
of larding pork, and the steak or 
other pieces of meat to be broiled 
laid on this, held at a proper distance 
from the fire, and turned once in a 
w-hile till done. A chop or steak, 
when properly grilled, should look 
plump in the middle, and should be 



86 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



rare and juicy, rather than dry and 
hard. 

For full instructions as to the time 
required for broiling, consult the 
Cook's Complete Time Table. But 
obsen'e that, in general, the time is 
regulated, not by weight, but by the 
thickness of the meat, and is approxi- 
mately as follows: For a steak, one 
and one-half inches thick, underdone, 
fifteen minutes; welldone, twenty 
minutes. For a steak, one inch thick, 
underdone, twelve minutes; welldone, 
fifteen minutes. For spring chicken, 
fifteen minutes, squab chicken, ten

of the year. 

Beef is affected as to quality by 
several conditions, such as the breed 
of the animal, the manner of feeding, 
the amount of exercise, the age when 
killed, and the length of time the 
meat is allowed to cure before being 
used. The beeves from the ranges 
of the West and Southwest — com- 
monly known in America as Western 
or Chicago beef — are to be preferred, 
as a rule, to local beef; indeed, there 
is very little of the latter nowadays 
in the American market. A grass-

minutes. 

SELECTION OF BEEF 

Characteristics of Beef. — Beef is a 
staple article with the butcher and 
the housekeeper the year round, for 
not only is a fresh supply constantly 
coming into the market, but a sur- 
plus is always kept in cold storage. 
Lamb and veal are especially season- 
able in early spring and summer, 
mutton and pork in late fall and 
winter; but beef of good quality may 
be had at any time, and may be 



fed steer, allowed to range on the 
open plains so as to receive a mod- 
erate amount of exercise, yields, in 
general, the best beef, as these con- 
ditions make the animal healthy and 
give the meat the finest flavor ; but the 
stall-fed steer also develops beef of 
good quality. The age of the animal 
at killing for prime beef is four 
years, but the beef continues to be 
good up to the eighth year of the ani- 
mal's age, after which it is likely to 
become tough and stringy. 

Both the flavor and texture of beef 
are very much improved by hanging, 
that is, being kept as long a time as 
possible before using. The objects of 



CATERING, COOKING AND CARVING 



87 



hanging are to allow the skins to dry 
thereby closing the pores so as to 
exclude the germs that cause decay 
and to allow the muscular fibers and 
other tissues to relax and soften. To 
accomplish these results a side of 
meat should be hung up (never laid 
flat on a table or shelf) either in the 
open air — which is to be preferred 
in a hot, dry climate — or in cold 
storage. The larger the side or cut, 
the longer it may be safely hung be- 
fore being used, and for this reason 
the heaviest sides of Western beef 
are quite commonly shipped to Eng- 
land, where the market demands large 
cuts with a " high " flavor resulting 
from long hanging. 

To select good beef, one should 
preferably go to the butcher-shop and 
inspect the meat in the full side, or 
at least before the cut is trimmed, 
and should require the cut selected to 
be set aside and trimmed in one's 
presence. The beef from a medium 
sized carcass, weighing eight hundred 
to nine hundred pounds, is likely to 
be best. The side or cut should be 
medium fat, not over fat, but cer- 
tainly not lean. 

With the aid of a little experience 
anyone can learn to distinguish be- 
tween the fine texture and bright 
color of young beef, and the coarse, 
dry texture and dark color of that 
from older animals. The flesh in 
healthy young beeves is firm and of 
fine texture; the color of the lean 
meat, bright red, that of the fat, yel- 
lowish white. But observe that a 
dark color in beef may be a mere 
surface discoloration due to exposure 
to the air, which may be trimmed ofi', 
leaving the rest of the cut entirely 
acceptable for use; or it may be an 
indication that the beef is old, or even 
tainted. The difference can easily be 
detected when the cut is trimmed. 
One may judge the quality of beef 
not only by the thickness of the layer 
of fat underlying the skin and about 
the kidneys, but also by the extent to 
which the meat is " marbled," i.e., 
shot through with yellowish white 
streaks and spots of fat. 

The portion of any animal that gets 
the least exercise is naturally the 
finest, both in texture and flavor. 



Hence the portion of all animals sur- 
rounding the backbone, contains the 
choicest cuts, and is preferred to the 
limbs, neck, and similar pieces. In 
the beef, the choice cuts are the prime 
ribs, commonly served as roasts, and 
the Delmonico, porterhouse, sirloin, 
and tenderloin cuts, which may be 
served either in the form of roasts or 
steaks. The chuck or shoulder clod 
and the rump, round, and top sirloin, 
stand next in order of general de- 
sirability. 

When the beef carcass is first 
divided into halves, the backbone is 
split lengthwise so that the cuts taken 
from the portions surrounding the 
backbone — including the rib roast, 
the Delmonico, the porterhouse, etc. — 
each contain a triangular piece of 
bone, representing one-half of the 
animal's vertebrae. The side is next 
divided into quarters, called, respec- 
tively, the fore- and hind-quarters, of 
which the muscles of the former 
having received more exercise are 
coarser and tougher than those of the 
latter. By reference to the accom- 
panying illustrations the sections of 
bone that are found in the various 
cuts of beef can be readily identified. 
From the standpoint of economy, it 
is apparent that, in general, the 
amount of bone in the cut should be 
small in proportion to the amount of 
meat. But in this connection the 
table given elsewhere, showing the 
relative amount of bone in the differ- 
ent cuts of meat, should be consulted. 

Perhaps the most fashionable cut 
of beef for a dinner-party is the filet 
roast, i.e., the entire tenderloin de- 
tached from the backbone and roasted. 
The filet should be cut from a young, 
fat beef, and should be well marbled 
with fat. But since the filet is essen- 
tially a piece of lean meat, it is cus- 
tomary to lard the tenderloin by 
drawing ribbons of fat pork through 
the upper surface by means of a lard- 
ing needle — a hollow implement de- 
signed expressly for this purpose — 
in such wise as to leave both ends 
protruding. The larding can be seen 
in the accompanying illustration of 
carving the tenderloin. 

The filet or tenderloin of beef is, in 
the opinion of many, greatly over- 



88 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



rated. For, although the tenderest of 
all cuts of beef, it is neither as juicy 
nor as rich in flavor as the rest of the 
loin. When planning for a filet roast, 
it is sound economy to buy the entire 
loin, i.e., the Delmonico and porter- 
house cuts — or such part of them as 
may be necessary to secure a filet of 
the described size — remove the ten- 
derloin for the filet roast, and reserve 
the rest to be served as steaks, or to 
be roasted subsequently. The thin 
end of the tenderloin, extending to- 
ward the rump, is less desirable, and 
would better be omitted, unless a 
very large filet is desired. 

Next to the tenderloin, the short 
loin — including the porterhouse, and 
Delmonico cuts — makes the juiciest 
and tenderest roast, and excels even 
the filet in flavor. This cut makes 
an excellent roast for the family din- 
ner to which one or more guests are 
invited. The short loin may be pre- 
pared for roasting in either of two 
ways, with or without the bone. 
Many hostesses prefer to have the 
bone removed to facilitate carving, 
in which case the butcher should be 
instructed to this effect when the 
roast is ordered. 

ROASTING. CARVING AND 
SERVING BEEF 

In buying a roast, allow about one 
pound, or slightly less, for each adult 
member of the company. That is, 
order a roast of from four to six 
pounds for a dinner-party of six 
people. To prepare the rib roast, 
or similar roast of beef, for a dinner- 
party, first make ready the roast as 
shown in the accompanying illustra- 
tions, or request the butcher to do so, 
and lay it in the dripping-pan upon 
the rack or trivet, as illustrated. Add 
salt, pepper and, unless the meat is 
very fat, a few drippings or pieces 
of fine fat. Put the skin side down 
and set the meat in a very hot oven, 
so that the fierce heat may sear and 
hold the juices in the lean part. 
When this part becomes brown, show- 
ing that the meat has become seared, 
baste with the fat, and reduce the 
heat. For a dinner-party or company 
dinner, beef should be roasted rare, 



the condition of beef roasted to a 
turn being indicated by the expression, 
" the blood should follow the knife." 

The time required for a thick 
piece of beef is about fifteen minutes 
to the pound, and fifteen minutes 
over, and the roast should be ready 
at least a half an hour before being 
carved, in order to allow the albumen 
inside to set. A somewhat longer 
time should be allowed for a roast 
which has been boned and rolled into 
symmetrical form as such a roast is 
more compact and the interior heats 
through more slowly. 

No water should be placed in the 
dripping-pan unless there is danger 
that the fat in the bottom may be 
burned, in which case a tablespoonful 
at a time may be added. The juices 
from the meat will ordinarily form 
a sufficient gravy. But the flavor of 
the gravy may be very much en- 
hanced by placing around the roast 
in the pan a few small carrots and 
onions, and a sprinkling of bay 
leaves, thyme, and parsley. Many 
hostesses also add small, new potatoes 
in season, previously peeled, to be 
baked, browned, and flavored by the 
roast. 

Lean roasts of meat and poultry or 
game birds, that are deficient in fat, 
may also require larding, i.e., the 
addition of some meat or vegetable 
fat, such as fine drippings, lard, 
crisco, or the like. Butter should not 
be used for this purpose, as it is 
likely to burn at the bottom of the 
pan. The gravj', however, should not 
be suffered to become too rich and 
greasy. If any fat is evident upon 
the surface of the gravy, it should 
be poured off before the gravy is 
served or thickened. 

The gravy may be thickened or 
not, as the hostess prefers, the un- 
thickened or " dish gravy " being usu- 
ally given preference at formal meals, 
and the thickened gravy being per- 
haps more customary at family din- 
ners. French cooks, in order to make 
a somewhat richer gravy, conunonly 
sprinkle dry flour over the roast be- 
fore placing it in the pan. After 
becoming browned and flavored by 
contact with the roasting meat, this 
flour, gradually falling into the bot- 



CATERING, COOKING AND CARVING

torn of the pan, browns and flavors 
the gravy and slightly thickens it. 
After the meat is done and has been 
removed to the platter, hold the cor- 
ner of the dripping-pan over a bowl, 
pour off the fat from the top of the 
gravy, and save it. Then pour one 
pint of good stock into the pan, dis- 
solve in it all the sediment of the 
coagulated albumen and juices, sim- 
mer until it has been reduced about 
one-third in bulk and pour into the 
sauce bowl. For further suggestions 
on the length of time required for 
roasting, consult the Cook's Complete 
Time Table. 

The prime ribs of beef are used 
chiefly for roasts, and constitute the 
best part of the fore-quarter.i Be- 
tween the four cuts of prime ribs 
there is a very decided preference. 
The first cut, that nearest the hind 
quarter, is very nearly equal in qual- 
ity to the short loin, and is valued 
accordingly. The second cut is also a 
very good roast. The others are less 
desirable in their order. Rib roasts 
may also be had boned and rolled 
by the butcher, if desired, but these 
cuts are quite commonly roasted with 
the bones, upon the ground that they 
give the roast additional flavor, and 
also cause it to present a more at- 
tractive appearance. Other less de- 
sirable, but also less expensive roasts, 
are the top of the round, i.e., the in- 
side of the hind quarter of the animal 
— so named because that side usually 
lies uppermost on the butcher's 
counter — the rump, and the chuck, 
or shoulder clod, a solid piece of meat 
of low cost, but of fair quality. 

Carving' and Serving Roast Beef. — 
The filet or tenderloin, properly 
larded, presents a very attractive ap- 
pearance, especially when garnished 
with a few sprigs of watercress or 
parsley. To carve, it should be held 
firmly with a fork, grasped in the left 
hand, and cut into slices slightly less 



1 In New York, all the ribs are cut on 
the forequarter; but in Boston and some 
other localities only ten ribs are cut on the 
forequarter, the remaining three being left 
on the hind-quarter. Other differences in 
the customs of cutting meat will be en- 
countered in different cities and, as a rule, 
will be cheerfully explained, on request, 
by the local butchers. 



than a half inch thick, beginning 
with the thicker or forward portion 
of the tenderloin, and continuing 
toward the thin end. The slices should 
be cut squarely across the grain of 
the tenderloin, which is usually at a 
slight angle from the plane on which 
the filet lies. 

To serve a filet of beef, serve each 
person one slice, add a few sprigs of 
parsley or cress, and put a spoonful 
of mushroom sauce upon the side of 
the plate. 

The short loin, the top of the round, 
the rump, and the chuck roasts are 
carved and served in the same man- 
ner as the tenderloin, i.e., in slices 
cut vertically across the grain, ex- 
cept that they should be sliced as 
thin as possible. The top of the 
round, especially, should be in very 
thin slices, as it is rather tough, 
although juicy and well flavored. 

The process of carving a porter- 
house, Delmonico, or rib roast de- 
pends upon whether or not the bones 
have been removed. In the latter 
case the roast should be rolled into 
symmetrical shape, and fastened by 
means of either metal or wooden 
skewers, preferably the former, or 
by means of cord. The proper cord 
for this purpose is rather large and 
soft, and should be cut into the right 
lengths, drawn tightly around the 
roast, and knotted at intervals of 
about one inch throughout its entire 
length. The cord should not be con- 
tinuous, else the carver will have dif- 
ficulty in separating it and it will 
present an untidy and awkward ap- 
pearance. 

The accompanying illustration shows 
a rib roast from which the bones have 
not been removed, the ends of the 
ribs being decorated with paper frills, 
and the platter garnished with water- 
cress. To carve such a roast, observe 
that it should be placed before the 
carver with the ribs protruding to his 
left. He then steadies the roast by 
grasping the uppermost rib with the 
left hand, and cuts very thin slices 
transversely across the grain, until 
the edge of the knife encounters the 
rib. He then draws the point of the 
knife across the slices near the bone, 
so as to separate them. 



90 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



The process of carving a porter- 
house, Delmonico, or rib roast from 
which the bone has been removed is 
precisely similar, except that the 
roast is steadied by means of a fork, 
firmly inserted at a point just be- 
low the slice that is next to be taken, 
and that the skewers or cords with 
which the roast is fastened together 
must be removed, one by one, as they 
are encountered. If the skewers are 
inserted, as they should be, directly 
across the grain of the meat, so as 
to be parallel with the slices, they 
can usually be loosened without diffi- 
culty, and should be placed upon the 
side of the platter or carving board. 
If the roast is bound with cords, only 
one cord should be cut at a time. 
This should be loosened with the fork, 
and allowed to fall upon the side of 
the platter or carving board, with due 
care that it does not come in contact 
with the cloth. The other cords 
should be left in place until the rest 
of the roast is sliced down to them, 
in order to keep it in shajie and pre- 
serve the uniformity of the slices, 
and also to prevent the juices from 
running out. 

Carving and Serving Beefsteak. — 
The Delmonico, porterhouse, and sir- 
loin cuts are very commonly served 
as steaks, either broiled or planked, 
broiled steak being a favorite dish 
in American households for informal 
family dinners, to which one or more 
guests are invited. Instructions for 
broiling and planking steaks are given 
elsewhere, but observe that any steak 
worthy of the name should be cut 
very thick — an inch and a half, or 
even two inches being about the 
proper thickness — and that they 
should be broiled or roasted very 
rare, so that the meat will be bright 
red, rather than white, or even brown, 
in color. One of the most common 
and flagrant errors of the American 
cook is to order (or accept) steaks 
cut a half inch or less in thickness, 
and to fry them until they are done 
brown through and through, and of 
a tough and leathery consistency. 

The carving of steak will be greatly 
expedited if the butcher is instructed 
to take out the bone — which can be 
done to very much better advantage 
before the steak is cooked than after- 



ward — and steaks to be planked are 
invariably boned before planking. 
Otherwise the carver should first re- 
move the bone by cutting along its 
edge with the thin round-pointed 
knife, which is elsewhere recom- 
mended for this purpose. He should 
then divide the entire steak, except 
the thin portion at the small end, into 
sections of an inch or more in width, 
depending upon the thickness of the 
steak and the number of guests, be- 
ginning with the wide or bone end of 
the steak. 

In serving porterhouse Delmonico 
and similar beefsteaks, the fact should 
be borne in mind that the tenderloin 
and wider portion of the steak, op- 
posite the tenderloin, is superior in 
texture and flavor to the narrow por- 
tion at the opposite end. Hence, in 
justice to all, it is desirable to divide 
the steak, if possible, into about twice 
as many strips as there are guests, 
and to serve each gueSt with one of 
the less desirable, as well as one of 
the more desirable portions. 

A steak should preferably be gar- 
nished with sprigs of watercress, one 
or two of which should be placed be- 
side each portion served, and a spoon- 
ful of gravy should be added upon the 
side of the plate. The planked steak 
is served with an assortment of vege- 
tables, the various vegetables being 
placed around the steak in orderly 
array, each kind by itself, so as to 
form a most effective garnish. 
Planked steak is first divided in the 
same manner as any other; then one 
or more slices are served to each 
plate, and a hcljiing of each of the 
various vegetables added, with care 
to preserve their separate identities 
and to avoid jumbling all together. 

SELECTION OF VEAL 

The subject of veal is of very slight 
importance from the standpoint of 
catering for entertainments, as roasts 
of veal are rarely employed for this 
purpose, and perhaps never except 
from the standpoint of economy. 
Veal is very much inferior to beef, 
both in flavor and in nutritive quali- 
ties, being immature at best, but the 
quality depends largely upon the age 
of the animal when killed, and the 



CATERING, COOKING AND CARVING 



91 



manner of feeding. The flesh of the 
calf killed under four weeks of age — 
" bob " veal — should never be used 
for food, and six to ten weeks of age 
is preferable as the time for killing. 
Veal should be very fine grained, 
tender, and either clear white or 
slightly pinkish in color. If the flesh 
is flabby, watery, and gray or bluish 
in color, the meat is immature and 
unwholesome. The skin should be 
very dry and white rather than of a 
grayish color. Veal is not very fat, 
as a rule, but there should be some 



pounds and makes a suitable roast 
for twelve or more people. These 
various roasts are sometimes served 
at informal family dinners, but are 
not usually regarded as suitable for 
formal meals or preferred when 
guests have been invited. The leg of 
veal is usually divided into cutlets. 
The loin or rack is frequently divided 
into chops. 

The loin of veal is carved precisely 
as the tenderloin or Delmonico roasts 
of beef, except that, being the entire 
joint, the roast is placed upon its 




Chart Illustrating American Method of Cutting Side of Veal 



fat to indicate that the animal has 
been properly nourished. The method 
of cutting up a side of veal is suf- 
ficiently shown in the illustration. 
The principal roasts are the loin and 
the shoulder. The loin of veal is 
prepared for roasting by being rolled 
up with the kidney in the center, and 
either tied with cord or fastened by 
means of skewers, after the same 
fashion as boned roasts of beef. The 
shoulder, or even the entire fore-quar- 
ter, is so small that it can be easily 
boned and rolled for a roast. A 
shoulder of veal weighs about ten 



side, with the backbone next the plat- 
ter. The slices are cut vertically 
across the grain and then detached by 
cutting with the point of the knife 
along the bone. The shoulder of veal 
is usually boned and stuflfed and is 
carved in the same fashion as the 
short loin, rump, chuck and similar 
cuts. 

While veal is seasonable in many 
markets the year around, the quality, 
as a rule, is best in the spring and 
summer. It is usually in its prime 
in May.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



SELECTION OF LAMB AND MUTTON 

From the standpoint of catering for 
entertainments, lamb and mutton rank 
next after beef in order of interest 
and importance, the leg of lamb, the 
crown roast, and the loin roast being 
esteemed as delicacies suitable for 
the most formal entertainments. The 
earliest, or so-called hot-house lambs, 
come into the market toward the end 
of winter, weighing about twelve or 
fifteen pounds. Around Easter time 
comes the so-called Easter lamb, 
weighing fifteen to twenty pounds. 



means equally as well flavored, in the 
judgment of epicures, as good mut- 
ton. Mutton, moreover, is much less 
expensive than lamb, is more eco- 
nomical to carve and serve, and, 
from the standpoint of family meals, 
is more desirable in every way. For 
formal entertainments and company 
dinners, however, the more delicate 
young Iamb is advisable. 

The best young lamb is from a 
carcass of medium weight, of fine, 
firm texture, clear pink in color, and 
neither too fat nor too lean. The fat 
should be clear white. The age of 




Chart Ilhistrating American Method of Cuttincj Side of Lamb or Mutton 



These are followed by the spring 
lamb, weighing eighteen to twenty- 
four pounds, during the months of 
May, June, and July. Sjiring lamb 
is at its prime in the latter part of 
June and July and continues in the 
market until about September. After 
that, the animal being a year or more 
old, its flesh is known as mutton. 

Young lamb meat has a characteris- 
tic pinkish color, which gradually 
deepens and becomes red in mutton. 
While spring lamb is esteemed as a 
great delicacy, it is, like veal, rela- 
tively inniiature meat, and is less di- 
gestible, less nutritious, and by no 



the animal may be determined by the 
bone in the foreleg, that of the young 
lamb being smooth, and that of the 
older animal showing ridges, which 
increase in depth with age. The 
quality of mutton may be judged by 
the amount of fat, the texture, and 
the weight. Mutton should be fatter 
than lamb, the flesh of fine rather 
than of coarse grain, and the carcass 
small to medium. A large carcass 
usually indicates age. Coarseness of 
texture indicates toughness. For 
good nnitton the animal should be 
plump, with small bones, and under 
five years of age. Lamb or mutton 



CATERING, COOKING AND CARVING 



93 



should be hung at least three weeks, 
and preferably longer, before serv- 
ing. The average mutton carcass 
weighs from thirty to forty pounds. 

The lamb or mutton carcass is 
usually divided, like the beef, first 
into halves or sides, and afterward 
into fore- and hind-quarters. But 
where a larger roast than the loin or 
crown roast is desired, the entire back 
portion of the animal, including the 
loin on both sides of the backbone, is 
taken out, this cut being known as 
the saddle of lamb or mutton. The 
leg and shoulder of lamb or mutton 
are commonly roasted whole. As in 
the case of beef, the loin of lamb is 
esteemed a great delicacy, and either 
single or in the form of saddle, is a 
favorite roast for company dinners, 
especially in England. The crown 
roast consists of the fourteen ribs of 
the fore-quarter, trimmed and ar- 
ranged in circular form, fastened 
with skewers, and stuffed with tlie 
portions trimmed off in dressing the 
roast which are chopped fine for this 
purpose. If a larger roast is re- 
quired, additional ribs can be inserted, 
taken from tlie opposite side. 

Lamb and mutton, although deli- 
cious when properly cooked, are often 
very uninviting from carelessness in 
cooking and serving. When properly 
decorated and garnished, the crown 
roast of lamb makes a very attractive 
dish, especially when carved at the 
table, after the English or the Ameri- 
can style of service. For family 
meals, the loin and rack are common- 
ly divided into loin and rib chops, 
respectively. These are broiled and 
served singly. 

The average leg of lamb weighs 
about six or seven pounds, and is suf- 
ficient to serve about seven or eight 
persons. A loin roast weighs about 
three pounds, and is sufficient for 
three persons. The saddle is, of 
course, exactly double the loin in 
quantity. The shoulder weighs four 
to five pounds, trimmed ready for 
roasting. The rack — that is, the 
portion of the spine on the fore-quar- 
ter to which the ribs are attached — 
weighs from two to four pounds. The 
shoulder, or rack, should serve three 
or four persons. 



CARVING AND SERVING IAMB 
AND MUTTON 

Roast Leg of Lamb. — To get the 
most from a leg of lamb, and to 
carve it easily, the butcher should be 
instructed to remove the hip bone. 
The joint should be put on the rack 
in the dripping-pan with the fleshy 
part up. French cooks flavor roast 
lamb by inserting four or live cloves 
of garlic at intervals over the surface, 
in small openings, made by thrusting 
the point of a wooden skewer through 
the fat and into the meat. A better 
flavor will also be imparted to the 
meat and to the gravy if a few car- 
rots and onions are placed around 
the roast in the pan. Small new po- 
tatoes may also be baked in the pan, 
as with the roasts of beef. 

When served, the bone in the leg 
of lamb may be decorated with a 
paper frill, and the platter garnished 
with sprigs of watercress or parsley. 
To carve this joint, it should be 
placed before the carver with the 
bone to the left and the skin side 
down and steadied by inserting the 
fork well down toward the end of the 
roast. Thin slices should then be cut, 
beginning at the right end, or thick- 
est portion of the roast, at an angle 
of about thirty degrees, working back 
to the left until the roast is sliced to 
the bone. Larger slices can be had 
by slicing horizontally across the top 
of the roast, but such slices, being cut 
with the grain, are not equally as 
tender or palatable. Some persons 
prefer to carve this roast vertically, 
making the first cut about the middle 
of the roast and taking slices from 
either side. And this plan has the 
merit of cutting directly across the 
grain, which is always an advantage. 
This method is objected to, however, 
by many, as not being economical of 
the roast, for the reason that the 
slices at either end are too small to 
serve and a portion of the roast is 
thereby wasted; whereas, by the 
method first above recommended, the 
slices taken at an angle across the 
grain, are sufficiently tender and 
palatable, and yet permit of carving 
the entire upper portion of the roast 
into good-sized slices. If more per- 



94 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



sons remain to be served after the 
upper part of the roast has been 
sliced down to the bone, the bone 
should be rennoved by making an in- 
cision on either side of it, loosening 
it at the end, and running the knife 
underneath, between the bone and the 
meat. The lower part of the roast 
may then be sliced the same as the 
upper part, the knife being held at 
such an angle as to increase to any 
desired extent the size of the slices. 

Saddle of Mutton. — Few joints are 
more toothsome or nutritious than 
the well cooked prime saddle of mut- 
ton, whether roasted entire or grilled 
in the form of English mutton chops, 
which include the kidney lying just 



may then be carved according to two 
entirely different methods. The Eng- 
lish method of carving is to slice the 
meat lengthwise. The French method 
is to slice each piece crosswise, pre- 
cisely as in serving a tenderloin of 
beef but in very thin slices. 

The crown roast, when properly 
trimmed, roasted, decorated, and gar- 
nished, makes an extremely attrac- 
tive dish, and is especially suitable 
for the formal breakfast or luncheon. 
The end of each rib should be dec- 
orated with a paper frill, and the 
platter garnished with cress or pars- 
ley. To carve a crown roast is most 
simple, the divisions between the ribs 
being clearly indicated, and no more 




Chart Illustrating American Method of Culting Side of Pork 



under the vertebrae. The best sad- 
dle of mutton comes from the short- 
legged breeds, having black legs and 
feet, and short, thick, stubby tails, 
such as the Southdown, in which the 
meat comes well down the leg, nearly 
reaching the feet. The saddle of 
lamb or mutton is rolled and fastened 
with skewers or tied with cords, and 
otherwise prepared and roasted after 
the same manner as the equivalent 
roasts of beef. This joint should 
first be boned. To this end place it 
■with the bone resting upon the plat- 
ter and the end toward the carver, 
make an incision the entire length 
down to the backbone and remove the 
meat from the bone in two pieces. It 



care being required than is necessary 
to cut the portions of equal thickness. 
A single chop, with a portion of 
stuffing, a few sprigs of cress or pars- 
ley, and a spoonful of gravy is served 
to each person. 

THE SELECTION OF PORK 

Pork is seasonable only in autumn 
and winter. The great bulk of the 
animal is so fat that it is unsuitable 
for food while fresh, and is therefore 
cured and salted as bacon, salt pork, 
and the like. The hams are served 
either fresh or cured, and may be 
baked, boiled, or broiled in the form 
of steaks. But with the exception of 



CATERING, COOKING AND CARVING 



96 



baked cured ham, sliced cold, no 
joint of pork is really suitable for 
service at entertainments. The ribs 
and loin are the most desirable fresh 
cuts, and may be either roasted or 
served in the form of chops. 

Fresh pork should be of firm tex- 
ture, and fine grain, the lean, pink 
and the fat, clear white in color. The 
loin of pork is prepared for roasting 
either with or without the bone, in 
much the same fashion as the loin of 
beef or mutton, except that, being a 
lean piece of meat, it may require to 
be larded with a strip of bacon or 
salt pork, laid over the top of the 
joint and fastened with cords, as 
shown in the illustration. This joint 
is carved in the same manner as the 
similar joints of beef. 

SELECTION OF POULTRY 

Chicken, turkey, geese, and domes- 
tic ducks are classified as poultry; 
wild duck, wild geese, partridge, reed 
birds, quail, and other small birds, 
as game. Poultry is a staple ar- 
ticle of diet, being more or less avail- 
able at every season of the year. The 
first broilers come into the market 
very early in the spring, and con- 
tinue to become more plentiful, and 
to decrease in price during the spring 
and summer. The season for broilers 
may be said to be at its height in 
May and June, at which time they 
make an excellent dish for formal 
breakfasts, luncheons, and similar 
entertainments, and afford a substi- 
tute for game birds for formal din- 
ners. The so-called milk-fed and 
early spring chickens begin to become 
available in July, and continue in the 
market until August. They are com- 
monly cooked, either a la casserole, or 
roasted, and make an admirable dish 
for luncheons, breakfasts, and dinner- 
parties, in the form of supreme of 
chicken, i. e., breasts of chicken, either 
sauted or broiled and served with any 
suitable sauce. Philadelphia capons 
begin to come in about the same time 
as roasting chicken, namely, in Sep- 
tember. They are commonly served 
at dinner, usually roasted. The ca- 
pon has a somewhat larger and 
plumper carcass than other chicken, 



and is further distinguished by its 
richer flavor. 

Chicken and other poultry is 
usually most plentiful before Thanks- 
giving, and the supply of local stock 
is generally exhausted on or before 
the holidays. After this the city 
markets are supplied chiefly with 
cold storage stock, and hold the local 
stock at an average level of about 
one-third higher. As the season ad- 
vances, the tendency is for the local 
stock to increase in relative price as 
the cold storage stocks shrink and 
deteriorate in quality. 

The season for turkey is now very 
similar to that for chicken. Not 
many years ago turkeys were thought 
to be at their best only on or 
after Thanksgiving Day, but young 
turkeys, comparable to chicken broil- 
ers and milk-fed chicken, are now 
commonly cooked and accepted as a 
summer delicacy. Young Guinea 
hen broilers and roasting chickens 
are also very delicious, being even 
more tender when properly cooked, 
than chicken, and having a distinc- 
tive flavor that makes them an ex- 
cellent substitute for game birds. 

The season for domestic ducks is 
the same as that for chicken. The 
quality of poultry depends upon the 
breed, the method of feeding, the age 
of the bird when killed, the manner 
in which the carcass is dressed, and 
the length of time that it has been 
upon the market. No other kind of 
meat requires more knowledge, skill, 
and care in catering than poultry. As 
to breed, the black and red feathered 
birds are always to be preferred over 
the light feathered varieties, and the 
gray feathered birds are always to be 
avoided. The best chickens have 
soft, yellow feet, smooth, thick legs, 
and smooth yellow or white skins. 
The yellow skinned birds are likely 
to be more plump, those having 
white skin more tender. The skin 
should be moist and tender, and the 
breast plump and firm. The car- 
tilage of the breastbone should be 
soft and pliable. But observe that 
this cartilage is sometimes broken to 
deceive purchasers, a device which, 
however, if the purchaser is upon his 
guard, can be very easily detected.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



As to feeding, grain-fed chickens 
are to be preferred to those fed upon 
table scraps or garbage. Fowls fed 
upon rice, as is quite customary in 
certain parts of the South, have white 
fat, and the Southern barnj'ard fed 
turkey, fattened on small rice, is 
among the finest of domestic fowl. 
Poultry fed on cornmeal have yellow 
fat. The so-called milk-fed chickens 
are presumed to be fed, or at least 
fattened, in large parts, upon meal, or 
other ground grain mixed with milk 
instead of water. 

The age of poultry at the time of 
killing may usually be detected by 
the legs and feet, which in young 
birds are smooth, moist, and supple, 
and in older fowl hard and scaly. 
One test is to try the skin under the 
leg or wing, or to seize a pinch of 
the breast meat and twist it. If the 
skin and flesh is tender and breaks 
easily, the bird is young and fresh. 
Otherwise, it is probably old, and 
certainly is tough. Also turn the 
wing backward. If the joint yields 
readily it is tender. The eyes of 
fresh young fowls are full and bright. 
A growth of hair over the carcass 
is an indication of age in both 
chicken or turkey. Plentiful pin 
feathers denote a young bird. The 
flesh of the old turkey, where it shows 
under the skin upon the back and 
legs, is purplish. Observe in this 
connection that about March turkeys 
begin to deteriorate in quality. 

As to the method of dressing, great 
care should be taken to avoid poul- 
try the flesh of which has become 
tainted and unwholesome. All poul- 
try should be promptly and properly 
drawn, but the laws of some states 
permit of fowls being kept for sale 
undrawn, a condition which is not 
only a serious menace to health, but 
is ruinous of their proper flavor. The 
partly, or otherwise improperly, 
drawn chicken is often as bad (and 
sometimes even worse) than the un- 
drawn one. The higher price charged 
in most markets for the so-called 
Philadelphia chicken is a premium 
paid for proper methods of killing 
and preparing them for market. 

The flavor of poultry is also im- 
paired by scalding, as an aid in re- 



moving the feathers, hence the dry 
picked fowl sells at a higher price, 
and is to be preferred, although its 
appearance may be somewhat less 
attractive. 

As to the length of time that poul- 
try has been upon the market, the law 
in most states gives the buyer little 
or no protection, and in these days of 
cold storage it behooves him to be 
upon his guard and to place little or 
no reliance upon the representations 
of dealers, except when buying in 
the most reliable local markets. One 
of the best tests of the fresh chicken 
is the color and condition of the eyes. 
If they are bright and clear, as in 
life, the chicken is fresh, but if dull 
and lusterless, or even further de- 
teriorated, the carcass has been for 
some time in cold storage. Another 
test is to open the beak of the 
chicken and note whether the blood 
is still red, in which case the chicken 
is fresh; whereas, if it is white, the 
opposite is true. 

A domestic duck or goose should 
never be more than a year old. 
Young ducks and geese have white, 
soft feet and tender wings. The 
body should be plump and thick, the 
fat light and semi-transparent, the 
breastbone soft, the flesh tender. The 
leg joints should break under the 
weight of the bird. The beak should 
be flesh-colored and brittle. The 
wind-pipe should break when pressed 
between the thumb and fore-finger. 

Domestic ducks — commonly called 
in Eastern markets. Long Island 
duckling — and the domestic geese, 
are, at ordinary prices, as economical 
as chicken, and may well be used for 
family dinners on Sundays, holidays, 
and other special occasions, for the 
sake of variety, somewhat more com- 
monly than they now are. The sea- 
son is the same as for poultry. 

SELECTION OF GAME BIRDS 

The principal game birds in the 
American market are Avild duck — 
such as the Canvas, Mallard, Redhead, 
Blackhead, Teal, and many others — 
the wild goose, partridge, pheasant, 
quail, woodcock, snipe, etc. The best 
test for selecting game birds is to 



CATERING, COOKING AND CARVING 



97 



weigh each one in the hand. The 
finest birds are always heaviest for 
their size. The flesh of the breast 
should be firm, fat, and plump, and 
the skin clear. Pluck a few feathers 
so as to expose the flesh inside the 
leg and about the vent. The flesh of 
the newly killed bird will be fresh in 
color and fat; that of the bird which 
has been hung a long time will be 
dark and discolored. The wings of 
the larger game birds should be 
tender to the touch. The small ones 
should have full and tender breasts. 
Note that in the partridge the tips 
of the wing are pointed in young 
birds, and round in old ones. The 
partridge should have full, heavy 
breasts, dark bill, and yellowish 
legs. 

A good substitute for the smaller 
game birds is the squab, or the young 
of the domestic pigeon, which are 
available in most city markets, at 
prices within the means of persons 
who have occasion to entertain in a 
formal way. The flesh of young 
pigeons is light red upon the breast, 
the legs are full and fresh colored. 
If the breast meat is dark and the 
legs thin, the birds are old. 

Wild duck and most other game 
birds are in season from November 
until March. 

DRESSING POULTRY AND GAME 

As a general thing, fresh killed 
poultry should not be cooked for 
twenty-four hours, although in hot 
climates, as, for example, in the 
Southern United States, broiling and 
roasting chickens are commonly sold 
alive, and killed by the cook and im- 
mediately prepared for the oven. But 
at all events, poultry should be 
picked and drawn as soon as possible 
after killing. . The flavor of poultry 
is better if the birds are picked dry, 
but the feathers will come ofi' more 
easily if the fowl is plunged into a 
pot of scalding water. After the 
carcass is picked clean it should be 
held over the coals or over a roll of 
burning white paper or an alcohol 
flame, to singe off" all hairs. 

To draw poultry and game, make 
cut around the vent and make an in- 



cision up toward the breast bone. 
Insert two fingers, loosen the fat 
from the skin and separate the mem- 
branes lying close to the body. Keep 
the fingers up close to the breastbone 
until you can reach in beyond the 
liver and heart and loosen them upon 
either side, gradually working the 
fingers around toward the back. 
Always remember that the gall 
bladder lies under the liver at the 
left side, and that, if it is broken, 
the contents will make every part of 
the meat that it touches bitter and 
unfit for use. If the fingers are kept 
up and everything is carefully loos- 
ened before being drawn out, there 
will be less danger of its breaking. 
The kidneys and lungs are not in- 
frequently left in by careless cooks, 
but everything should be taken out 
that is movable. After the bird has 
been drawn, it should be wiped dry, 
inside and out, with a clean towel. 
The head and neck should then be 
cut off, and the bird trussed for the 
oven. 

To Truss a Chicken or Turkey draw 
the thighs up close to the body, cross 
the legs over the vent, and tie firmly 
with twine. Thrust a skewer through 
one tliigh, into the body, and out 
through the opposite thigh, and an- 
other in like manner through the 
wings. Draw the wings and thigh 
closely together, and tie firmly with 
twine. Since poultry and game birds 
have little or no fat in the meat under 
the skin they should be larded by lay- 
ing a thin strip of salt pork or 
bacon over the breast after the 
carcass has been placed on its back 
in the dripping-pan, as shown in 
the accompanying illustrations. When 
roasting a chicken or small fowl 
there is danger that the legs may 
burn or become too hard to be eaten. 
To avoid this, a strip of cloth dipped 
in a little melted lard, or rubbed with 
lard, may be wound about the legs 
while the heat in the oven is highest, 
and afterward removed in time to al- 
low the legs to brown sufl5ciently. 
This difficulty will be overcome, how- 
ever, if the deep roasting pan with a 
close cover is used, as shown in the 
illustrations. These pans are made 
double, with only a small opening in 



98 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



the top as a vent for the accumulation 
of steam and gases, but retain most of 
the moisture and flavor of the juices, 
that would otherwise be lost in large 
measure by evaporation. 

To dress a chicken or other bird 
for broiling, pick, singe, cut off the 
head and neck close to the breast, 
and the legs at the knee joints. Singe, 
wipe dry, and split down the middle 
of the back, instead of along the belly. 
Lay the carcass open, and remove 
the contents. Cut the tendons in the 
thighs or break the joints, and re- 
move the breast bone to facilitate 
carving. Lay the carcass flat be- 
tween the double broiler, as illus- 
trated, or upon the bars of the grill, 
and broil, for the squab chicken, ten 
minutes, and for the spring chicken, 
fifteen minutes. 

To cut up a raw chicken for 
fricasseeing, pick and wipe dry 
as for a roasting chicken. First 
take off the legs from the carcass, 
then the wings. Then separate the 
breast from the remainder of the 
carcass. Split it into two and cut 
each half of the breast into either 
two or three parts, according to the 
size of the chicken. Cut the rest of 
the carcass crosswise, in three pieces 
or, if the chicken is very big, split 
the carcass in two before cutting 
crosswise. 

CARVING AND SERVING 
POULTRY AND GAME 

Carving Poultry. — To carve a 
turkey or other large bird, such as 
goose, duck, or roasting chicken, 
place the carcass on a platter or 
wooden carving board, upon its back, 
with the head to the left, the carcass 
resting diagonally rather than at 
right angles to the carver's body. 
Insert a fork firmly across the breast 
bone, grasp the fork with the left 
hand, firmly enough to steady the 
carcass, and with the knife divide the 
skin between the leg and the carcass 
on the side nearest the carver, cutting 
clear down to the leg joint. Force 
the leg over sharply from the carcass, 
so as to expose the joint, and com- 
pletely sever the drumstick and sec- 
ond joint in one piece from the car- 



cass. Separate the drumstick from 
the second joint by cutting from the 
point of the angle between them upon 
the inside, straight in and directly 
across the joint, the exact location 
of which can be easily ascertained by 
the sense of touch by manipulating 
with the fingers and feeling the joint 
in the carcass of the uncooked bird. 
If this cut is made at the right point, 
no further difficulty need be antici- 
pated. For if the knife is drawn 
squarely across the joint, it will sepa- 
rate without resistance, whereas at 
any other point the knife will en- 
counter solid bone. 

Now make an incision along either 
side of the bone, in the second joint, 
cut under the bone at the end, lift 
it up, and cut underneath and be- 
tween the bone and the meat, so as 
to remove the bone from this joint 
entirely. 

Now carve thin slices of the white 
meat from the breast, parallel with 
the breastbone, and similar slices of 
the dark meat from the face of the 
second joint, also parallel with the 
bone, and serve to each person a slice 
of the white and a slice of the dark 
meat, with a few sprigs of cress or 
parsley, a portion of the dressing, 
and a spoonful of gravy upon the 
side of the plate. 

If the slices from the breast and 
second joint are sufBcient to serve 
the entire company, the carver need 
proceed no further; but if not, the 
wing should next be cut off, in the 
same manner as the leg, and similar- 
ly divided at the joint, the second 
joint of the wing being served as 
one portion. The tip of the wing 
and the drumstick are neither carved 
nor served except when necessary at 
the family dinner but are usually re- 
served and consumed in the form of 
hash, or other palatable r^chauff^. 

Should the whole turkey be re- 
quired, the platter should be turned 
and the opposite side carved in pre- 
cisely the same fashion, but the 
carver should proceed no further 
than is necessary, leaving the re- 
mainder of the carcass intact, for 
another meal. 

Roasting Duck. — The wild duck, 
notably the Canvasback, Mallard, 



CATERING, COOKING AND CARVING 



99 



and Redhead, are deservedly among 
the most popular game birds of the 
world. They are roasted, without 
trussing, in their own juices, but 
when roasting Mallard it is cus- 
tomary to put inside the carcass a 
few sticks of celery. Wild duck are 
so expensive as rarely to be served 
in the ordinary household, and are 
still more rarely properly cooked. 
Duck should be roasted very rare, 
the test of duck done to a turn being 
that " the blood will follow" the knife." 
To find out whether the duck is done, 
lift the bird and let a few drops of 
blood run out from the carcass. If 
the blood comes out red, the duck 
is under-done; if it comes out bluish, 
it is ready to be served. 

To carve wild duck. — One duel 
is usually served for two persons, 
although occasionally a large duck, 
like the Mallard, might be big enough 
for three. To carve wild duck, in- 
sert a fork in the carcass with the 
left hand, just behind the breast- 
bone, make an incision with the 
knife from the point of the breast- 
bone down the middle of the breast, 
and cut along this line between the 
breastbone and the meat, beginning 
at the head of the bird, and forcing 
the knife between the bone and the 
meat until the whole breast has been 
removed in one piece. Where a 
duck is served for two persons, half 
of the breast is served to each, the 
remainder of the carcass being re- 
served for salmi or similar re- 
chauflF6. 

To carve a partridge. — Place the 
bird with the head toward the carver, 
insert a fork near the breastbone, 
and cut through the center of the 
breast and back, lengthwise, cutting 
the bird right through. Serve a half 
of the partridge to each person, with 
currant jelly, and bread sauce, or 
fried bread crumbs. Sometimes a 
large partridge may be served to 
the three persons by separating the 
breast from the breastbone, and di- 
viding the breast into three parts. 

To carve a broiler. — Place the 
chicken with the head toward the 
carver, disjoint the leg by insert- 
ing a fork in the second joint and 
making an incision with the knife 



around the leg joint, bend the joint 
over sharply, separate it from the 
breast, and divide the leg at the joint. 
Split the breast in two. Serve half 
the breast and the second joint to 
each person, with a spoonful of 
drawn butter and a few sprigs of 
cress or parsley. Or each half of 
the breast and each second joint may 
be served on toast, as separate por- 
tions. Broiled chicken is an ex- 
cellent dish to serve for a breakfast 
or luncheon. 

To carve a broiled young, or 
spring-, turkey, proceed precisely 
as for the broiled chicken, but cut 
the second joint and each half of 
the breast into two parts. To carve 
broiled Guinea hen, proceed pre- 
cisely as for a broiled chicken. 

Quail, woodcock, snipe, and other 
small birds are served whole, a 
single bird to each person. The 
diner, in separating for himself the 
meat of small birds from the carcass, 
should bear in mind that, however 
toothsome may seem these tempting 
morsels, it is not customary to dis- 
sect the small carcass in order to 
secure every edible morsel, but that, 
as a rule, only the thick meat upon 
the breast, and perhaps a portion of 
the second joint, is eaten. No blun- 
der is commoner or more egregious 
than to cut off the drumstick and 
pick it up with the fingers, in order 
to gnaw the meat from the bone. 
The trite old saying, that fingers 
were made before forks, so common- 
ly quoted as an apology, only serves 
to make the offense greater, and the 
offender more ridiculous. A person 
who handles small game birds after 
this fashion, at a formal dinner — 
which is the only occasion when they 
are likely to be served — lays himself 
open to the suspicion that he is 
doubtful of ever having such another 
opportunity and is resolved to make 
the most of the present one. 

UTENSILS FOR CARVING 

When joints, poultry, or game are 
carved in the pantry or on the side 
board, as is customary for formal 
table service a la Russe, the joint 
or bird is removed from the platter 



100 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



upon which it is brought in, to a 
carving board, a flat piece of hard 
wood, which may or may not be 
mounted upon short legs, and sur- 
rounded by a strip of silver or other 
metal. The carving board should pre- 
ferably be about one and one-half 
or two Inches in thickness, and 
should be scored with a number of 
grooves, converging into a well or 
depression at one end of the board 
to catch and retain the meat juices 
or gravy. 

The use of the carving board for 
carving at table in private houses is 
a new custom, and by no means a 
generally established one. Indeed, a 
fancy carving board is not obtain- 
able in many localities, although the 
style of board used for planking 
steak or fish affords a good substi- 
tute, and if bought and reserved ex- 
clusively for this purpose, may be re- 
garded as entirely satisfactory. 
Where the roast is brought in upon 
a silver trencher, the carving board 
is really necessary, to avoid scratch- 
ing the metal. And even where the 
roast is brought in upon an ordinary 
porcelain platter, it can be handled 
much more satisfactorily if trans- 
ferred to the carving board. For the 
coarser texture of the board prevents 
the roast from slipping away from 
the carver, and by giving the carver 
more room, it does away with the 
liability of gravy stains and similar 
accidents. After the roast has been 
placed upon the carving board and 
carved, the portions are replaced 
upon the platter before serving. 
Whether or not the carving board 
is used, the instructions given for 
carving the various joints and 
birds, respectively, are in no wise 
altered. 

A complete set of carving tools of 
the best quality, such as that em- 
ployed professionally by the writer, 
consists of twelve knives of assorted 
sizes, a fork, and a steel, which, 
packed in a suitable case, cost ap- 
proximately fifty dollars. Two, or at 
most, three knives, besides the fork 
and steel, are sufficient for the ordi- 
nary householder. A large, thin, 
broad-bladed, round-pointed knife, 



about twelve inches long, is desirable, 
but is used for carving beefsteaks 
only. A sharp-pointed knife of the 
French pattern, shown in the accom- 
panying illustrations, about nine 
inches long, is the best utensil for gen- 
eral use in carving roasts, as joints of 
meat and poultry. And a similar knife 
about seven inches long is desirable 
for carving duck, partridge, and other 
game birds. A suitable fork is, of 
course, necessary, and while the ex- 
pert carver does not require the pro- 
tection of the steel guard upon the 
fork, such a device is advisable for 
the inexperienced person, for in carv- 
ing, the edge of the knife is often 
drawn toward the hand holding the 
fork, and the resistance of the knife 
blade varies greatly, and there is 
always danger that its edge may be 
deflected by a skewer or piece of bone 
or tendon, so that serious accidents 
are liable to occur. 

No one can do satisfactory carv- 
ing without a sharp knife, and to 
this end it is thoroughly sound 
economy to buy a carving set of the 
best steel, to cause the knives to be 
ground as often as may be necessary 
to keep them sharp, and to furnish 
oneself with a good steel. The edge 
of the carving knife, like that of the 
razor, deteriorates more or less while 
standing, and hence the carver should 
always sharpen the knife upon the 
steel immediately before using. To 
use the steel, it should be held in the 
left hand, the point raised and in- 
clining slightly toward the carver's 
body. The knife should be held in 
the right hand, at an angle of about 
thirty-five degrees from the steel, and 
drawn along the side of the steel, 
from the point of the steel down- 
ward toward the hand and from the 
heel to the point of the knife, the 
strokes being reversed from side to 
side of the steel. The touch should 
be very light, as a good steel — espe- 
cially if it has been thoroughly mag- 
netized as it should be — will not fail 
to do its work if contact with the 
edge of the knife is really established. 
About a half-dozen strokes will be 
sufficient, unless the knife is very 
much out of condition.

GENERAL METHODS OF PREPAH- 
ING MEAT FOR THE TABLE 

The advantages of variety in the 
methods of preparing and serving are 
to be considered even more seriously 
in the coolsing of the cheaper cuts 
than in the cooking of the more ex- 
pensive ones, and yet even in this con- 
nection it is a mistake to lose sight of 
the fact that, though there is a great 
variety of dishes, the processes in- 
volved are few in number. 

An experienced teacher of cooking, 
a woman who has made very valuable 
contributions to the art of cookery 
by showing that most of the numer- 
ous processes outlined and elaborately 
described in the cook books can be 
classified under a very few heads, says 
that she tries " to reduce the cook- 
ing of meat to its lowest terms and 
teach only three ways of cooking. 
The first is the application of in- 
tense heat to keep in the juices. This 
is suitable only for portions of clear 
meat where the fibers are tender. By 
the second method the meats are put 
in cold water and cooked at a low 
temperature. This is suitable for 
bone, gristle, and the toughest por- 
tions of the meat, which for this pur- 



1 U. S. Department of Agriculture Farm- 
ers Bulletin No. 391. 



101 



pose should be divided into small bits. 
The third is a combination of these 
two processes and consists of searing 
and then stewing the meat. This is 
suitable for halfway cuts, 1. e., those 
that are neither tender nor very 
tough." The many varieties of meat 
dishes are usually only a matter of 
flavor and garnish. 

In other words, of the three proc- 
esses the first is the short method; it 
aims to keep all the juices within the 
meat. The second is a very long 
method employed for the purpose of 
getting all or most of the juices out. 
The third is a combination of the two 
not so long as the second and yet re- 
quiring so much time that there is 
danger of the meat being rendered 
tasteless unless certain precautions are 
taken such as searing in hot fat or 
plunging into boiling water. 

It is commonly said that the cooked 
meat fibers are harder or less tender 
than the raw, which seems a natural 
assumption since the meat protein, 
like egg albumen, is coagulated by 
heat, and furthermore, the water is 
forced out from the individual 
muscle fibers and they are shortened 
and thickened by the application of 
heat. . . . 

A good idea of the changes which 
take place while meat is being cooked 



102 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



can be obtained by examining a piece 
of flesh which has been " cooked to 
pieces," as the saying goes. In this 
the muscular fibers may be seen com- 
pletely separated one from another, 
showing that the connective tissue has 
been destroyed. It is also evident 
that the fibers themselves are of dif- 
ferent texture from those in the raw 
meat. In preparing meat for the 
table it is usual to stop short of the 
point of disintegration, but while the 
long process of cooking is going on 
the connective tissue is gradually soft- 
ening and the fibers are gradually 
changing in texture. Tlie former is 
the thing to be especially desired, but 
the latter is not. For this reason it 
is necessary to keep the temperature 
below the boiling point and as low as 
is consistent with thorough cooking, 
for cooks seem agreed, as the result 
of experience shows, that slow gentle 
cooking results in better texture than 
is the case when meat is boiled rap- 
idly. This is the philosophy that lies 
back of the simmering process. 

When meat is cooked by roasting, 
broiling, or any other similar process 
the meat juices brown with the fat, 
producing substances which to most 
of us are agreeable to the senses of 
smell and taste alike. When meats 
are cooked in hot water such highly 
flavored substances are not so evident 
to the sense of smell, but neverthe- 
less bodies of agreeable flavor which 
are perceptible to the palate are de- 
veloped in the meat during the cook- 
ing process and are of smilar value 
in promoting digestion. 

The chief loss in weight when meat 
is cocked is due to the driving off of 
water. When beef is cooked by pan 
broiling — that is, searing in a hot, 
greased pan, a common cooking proc- 
ess — no great loss of nutrition re- 
sults, particularly if the fat and other 
substances adhering to the pan are 
utilized in the preparation of gravy. 
When beef is cooked by boiling, there 
is a loss of 3 to 20 per cent, of material 
present, though this is not an actual 
loss if the broth is utilized for soup 
or in some similar way. Even in the 
case of meat which is used for the 
preparation of beef tea or broth, the 
losses of nutritive material are ap- 



parently small though much of the 
flavoring matter has been removed. 
The amount of fat found in broth 
varies directly with the amount 
originally present in the meat; the 
fatter the meat the greater the quan- 
tity of fat in the broth. The loss of 
water in cooking varies inversely with 
the fatness of the meat; that is, 
the fatter the meat the smaller the 
shrinkage due to loss of water. In 
cooked meat the loss of various con- 
stituents is inversely proportional to 
the size of the cut. In other words, 
the smaller the piece of meat the 
greater the percentage of loss. Loss 
also appears to be dependent some- 
what upon the length of time the 
cooking is continued. When pieces 
of meat weighing 1^ to 5 pounds are 
cooked in water somewhat under the 
boiling point there appears to be little 
difference in the amount of material 
found in broth whether the meat is 
placed in cold w^ater or hot water at 
the beginning of the cooking period. 
When meat is roasted in the oven 
the amount of material removed is 
somewhat aflfected by the character of 
the roasting pan and similar factors, 
thus the total loss in weight is nat- 
urally greater in an open than in a 
closed pan as the open pan offers 
more opportunity for the evapora- 
tion of water. Judging from the 
average results of a considerable 
number of tests it appears that a 
roast weighing 6 pounds raw should 
weigh 5 pounds after cooking, or in 
other words the loss is about one- 
sixth of the original weight. This 
means that if the raw meat cost 20 
cents per pound the cooked would 
represent an increase of 4 cents a 
pound on the original cost; but this 
increase would of course be lessened 
if all the drippings and gravy are 
utilized. With the quantities used in 
the ordinary home the relative losses 
sustained in different methods of 
cooking meat are not great enough 
to be of particular importance with 
reference to economical management. 
However, in public institutions where 
a small saving per day for each in- 
mate represents a large item in the 
course of a year, it may be desirable 
to select methods involving the least 



ECONOMICAL USE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 103 



loss, which would mean that the advan- 
tage would lie with stewing and boil- 
ing rather than with broiling or roast- 
ing, so far as the relative losses of 
material are concerned. The relative 
economy of different methods of cook- 
ery depends very greatly upon the 
kind of fuel, the form of stove and 
oven, and other similar factors. 
These vary so much under different 
home conditions that it is diflBcult to 
draw general deductions though the 
subject has often been investigated. 
However, it may be said that it is 
often possible to effect a saving if the 
housewife can so plan the cooking of 
meat and other foods as to take full 
advantage of the heat supplied by 
the fuel used. 

REDTTCING THE EXPENSE FOR 
MEAT IN THE DIET 

The expense for meat in the home 
may be reduced ... by careful at- 
tention to the use of meat, bone, fat, 
and small portions commonly trimmed 
off and thrown away and the utiliza- 
tion of left-over portions of cooked 
meat; and the use of the less expen- 
sive kinds. 

UTILIZING THE FAT, BONE AND 
TRIMMINGS IN MEATS AND THE 
LEFT-OVER COLD MEAT§ 

In the percentage of fat present in 
different kinds and cuts of meat, a 
greater difference exists than in the 
percentage of proteids. The lowest 
percentage of fat ordinarily found in 
meat is 8.1 per cent, as in the shank 
of beef; the highest is 32 per cent, in 
pork chops. The highest priced cuts, 
loin and ribs of beef, contain 20 to 25 
per cent. If the fat of the meat is 
not eaten at the table, and is not 
utilized otherwise, a pecuniary loss re- 
sults. If butter is the fajt, used in 
making crusts for meat pies, and in 
preparing the cheaper cuts, there is 
little economy involved; the fats from 
other meat should therefore be saved, 
as they may be used in place of but- 
ter in such cases, as well as in pre- 
paring many other foods. The fat 
from sausage or from the soup kettle, 
or from a pot roast, which is savory 



because it has been cooked with veg- 
etables, is particularly acceptable. 
Sometimes savory vegetables, onion, 
or sweet herbs are added to fat when 
it is tried out to give it flavor. 

Some illustrations of methods of 
preparing such cooking fats follow: 

Trying Out Fat.— A double boiler 
is the best utensil to use in trying 
out small portions of fat. There is 
no danger of burning the fat and the 
odor is much less noticeable than if 
it is heated in a dish set directly over 
the fire. 

Clarifying Fat. — Excepting where 
the purpose of clarifying fat is to 
remove flavors, a good method to fol- 
low is to pour boiling water over the 
fat, to boil thoroughly, and then to 
set it away to cool. The cold fat 
may be removed in a solid cake and 
any impurities clinging to it may be 
scraped off, as they will be found at 
the bottom of the layer. By repeat- 
ing this process two or three times a 
cake of clean, white fat may be ob- 
tained. 

A slight burned taste or similar ob- 
jectionable flavors often can be re- 
moved from fat by means of pota- 
toes. After melting the fat, put into 
it thick slices of raw potato; heat 
gradually. When the fat ceases to 
bubble and the potatoes are brown, 
strain through a cloth placed in a 
wire strainer. 

Savory Drippings. — When render- 
ing the drippings of fat meat, add 
a small onion (do not cut it), a few 
leaves of summer savory and thyme, 
a teaspoonful of salt, and a little 
pepper. This is enough for a pint of 
fat. Keep the drippings covered and 
in a cool place. 

Uses for Bones. — Almost any 
meat bones can be used in soup mak- 
ing, and if the meat is not all removed 
from them the soup is better. But 
some bones, especially the rib bones, 
if they have a little meat left on them, 
can be grilled or roasted into very 
palatable dishes. The " spare-rib " of 
southern cooks is made of the rib 
bones from a roast of pork, and 
makes a favorite dish when well 
browned. The braised ribs of beef 
often served in high-class restaurants 
are made from the bones cut from 



104 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



rib roasts. In this connection it may- 
be noted that many of the dishes pop- 
ular in good hotels are made of por- 
tions of meat such as are frequently 
thrown away in private houses, but 
which with proper cooking and sea- 
soning make attractive dishes and give 
most acceptable variety to the menu. 
An old recipe for " broiled bones " 
directs that the bones (beef ribs or 
sirloin bones on which the meat is not 
left too thick in any part) be 
sprinkled with salt and pepper (Cay- 
enne), and broiled over a clear fire 
until browned. Another example of 
the use of bones is boiled marrow 
bone. The bones are cut in conven- 
ient lengths, the ends covered with a 
little piece of dough over which a 
floured cloth is tied, and cooked in 
boiling water for two hours. After 
removing the cloth and dough, the 
bones are placed upright on toast 
and served. Prepared as above, the 
bones may also be baked in a deep 
dish. Marrow is sometimes removed 
from bones after cooking, seasoned, 
and served on toast. 

Trimmings from meat may be util- 
ized in various " made dishes," of 
which examples will be given further 
on, or they can always be put to good 
use in the soup kettle. It is surpris- 
ing how many economies may be 
practiced in such ways and also in 
the table use of left-over portions of 
cooked meat if attention is given to 
the matter. Many of the recipes 
given in this bulletin involve the use of 
left-overs. Others will suggest them- 
selves or may be found in all the 
usual cookery books. 

Extending the Flavor of Meat. — 
Common household methods of ex- 
tending the meat flavor through a 
considerable quantity of material 
which would otherwise be lacking in 
distinctive taste are to serve the meat 
with dumplings, generally in the dish 
with it, to combine the meat with 
crusts, as in meat pies or meat rolls, 
or to serve the meat on toast and, bis- 
cuits. Borders of rice, hominy, or 
mashed potatoes are examples of the 
same principles applied in different 
ways. By serving some preparation 
of flour, rice, hominy, or other food 
rich in starch with the meat we get 



a dish which in itself approaches 
nearer to the balanced ration than 
meat alone and one in which the meat 
flavor is extended through a large 
amount of material. 

Throughout the measurements given 
in the recipe call for a level spoonful 
or a level cupful, as the case may 
be. 

A number of recipes for meat 
dishes made with dumplings and sim- 
ilar preiDarations follow: 

Meat Stew with Dumplings. 
Stew. 

5 pounds of a cheaper cut of beef. 

4 cups of potatoes cut into small 
pieces. 

§ cup each of turnips and car- 
rots cut into ^-inch cubes. 

i onion, chopped, 

i cup of flour. 

Salt and pepper. 

Cut the meat into small pieces, re- 
moving the fat; try out the fat and 
brown the meat in it. When well 
browned, cover with boiling water, 
boil for five minutes and then cook 
in a lower temperature until the meat 
is done. If tender, this will require 
about three hours on the stove or five 
hours in the fireless cooker. Add 
carrots, turnips, onions, pepper and 
salt during the last hour of cooking, 
and the potatoes fifteen minutes be- 
fore serving. Thicken with the flour 
diluted with cold water. Serve with 
dumplings (see below). If this dish 
is made in the fireless cooker, the mix- 
ture must be reheated when the veg- 
etables are put in. Such a stew may 
also be made of mutton. If veal or 
pork is used the vegetables may be 
omitted or simply a little onion used. 
Sometimes for variety the browning 
of the meat is dispensed with. When 
white meat, such as chicken, veal, or 
fresh pork, is used, the gravy is often 
made rich with cream or milk thick- 
ened with flour. The numerous minor 
additions which may be introduced 
give the great variety of such stews 
found in cookbooks. 

Dtimplings. 
2 cups flour. 
4 teaspoon fuls baking powder. 



ECONOMICAL USE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 105 



S cup milk or a little more if 

needed. 
i teaspoonful salt. 
2 teaspoonfuls butter. 

Mix and sift the dry ingredients. 
Work in the butter with the tips of 
fingers, add milk gradually, roll out 
to a thickness of one-half inch and 
cut with biscuit cutter. In some 
countries it is customary to season 
the dumplings themselves with herbs, 
etc., or to stuflF them with bread 
crumbs fried in butter instead of de- 
pending upon the gravy to season 
them. 

A good way to cook dumplings is 
to put them in a buttered steamer 
over a kettle of hot water. They 
should cook from twelve to fifteen 
minutes. If it is necessary to cook 
them with the stew, enough liquid 
should be removed so that they may 
be placed upon the meat and vege- 
tables. 

Sometimes the dough is baked and 
served as biscuits over which the stew 
is poured. If the stew is made with 
chicken or veal it is generally termed 
a fricassee. 

Ragout of Mutton with Farina 
Balls. 

I J pounds neck of mutton cut into 

small pieces. 
1 tablespoonful butter, 
1 tablespoonful flour. 
1 onion. 

1 carrot. 

i can peas. 

2 cups hot water. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

i teaspoonful pepper. 

1 bay leaf. 

Sprig parsley. 

1 clove. 

Farina Balls 
i cup farina. 
1 cup milk. 
i teaspoonful salt, 
j teaspoonful pepper. 
Onion juice. 
-Yolk 1 egg. 

Put butter in frying pan. When 
melted add flour and brown. Add 
carrot and onion, cut in dice. Re- 
move vegetables and add meat, sear- 



ing well. To meat and vegetables 
add hot water and seasonings. Put 
in a suitable kettle, cover and sim- 
mer two hours. Add peas ten min- 
utes before serving in a dish with 
farina balls made as follows: 

Cook farina and milk in double 
boiler one hour. Add seasoning and 
well-beaten yolk. Stir well and cool. 
When cold roll into balls. Dip in egg 
and crumbs and fry in deep fat. 
Rice may be used in a similar way. 

MEAT PIES AND SIMILAR DISHES 

Meat pies represent another method 
of combining flour with meat. They 
are ordinarily baked in a fairly deep 
dish the sides of which may or may 
not be lined with dough. The cooked 
meat, cut into small pieces, is put into 
the dish, sometimes with small pieces 
of vegetables, a gravy is poured over 
the meat, the dish is covered with a 
layer of dough, and then baked. 
Most commonly the dough is like 
that used for soda or cream-of- 
tartar biscuit, but sometimes short- 
ened pastry dough, such as is 
made for pies, is used. This is es- 
pecially the case in the fancy indi- 
vidual dishes usually called patties. 
Occasionally the pie is covered with 
a potato crust in which case the meat 
is put directly into the dish without 
lining the latter. Stewed beef, veal, 
and chicken are probably most used 
in pies, but any kind of meat may be 
used, or several kinds in combina- 
tion. Pork pies are favorite dishes 
in many rural regions, especially at 
hog-killing time, and when well made 
are excellent. 

If pies are made from raw meat 
and vegetables longer cooking is 
needed than otherwise, and in such 
cases it is well to cover the dish 
with a plate, cook until the pie is 
nearly done, then remove the plate, 
add the crust, and return to the oven 
until the crust is lightly browned. 
Many cooks insist on piercing holes 
in the top crust of a meat-pie di- 
rectly it is taken from the oven. 

Twelve o'clock Pie. 

This is made with shoulder of mut- 
ton, boiled with carrot and onion, then 



106 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



cut up, mixed with potatoes sepa- 
rately boiled and cut up, and put into 
a baking dish. The crust is made by 
mixing smoothly mashed potatoes to 
which a tablespoonful of shortening 
has been added, with enough flour 
and water to make them roll out 
easily. A pie made of a pound of 
meat will require 5 or 6 small boiled 
potatoes, a cupful of mashed pota- 
toes, and 8 or 10 tablespoonfuls of 
flour, and should be baked about 
twenty minutes in a hot oven. Salt, 
pepper, and other seasoning, as onion 
and carrot, may be added to taste. A 
teaspoonful of baking powder makes 
the crust lighter. 

Meat and Tomato Fie. 

This dish presents an excellent way 
of using up small quantities of either 
cold beef, or cold mutton. If fresh to- 
matoes are used, peel and slice them; 
if canned, drain off the liquid. Place 
a layer of tomato in a baking dish, 
then a layer of sliced meat, and over 
the two dredge flour, pepper and 
salt; repeat xmtil the dish is nearly 
full, then put in an extra layer of 
tomato and cover the whole with a 
layer of pastry or of bread or cracker 
crumbs. When the quantity of meat 
is small, it may be " helped out " by 
boiled potatoes or other suitable 
vegetables. A few oysters or mush- 
rooms improve the flavor especially 
when beef is used. The pie will need 
to be baked from half an hour to an 
hour according to its size and the heat 
of the oven. 

Meat and Pastry Rolls. 

Small quantities of cold ham, 
chicken, or other meat may be utilized 
for these. The meat should be 
chopped fine, well seasoned, mixed 
with enough savory fat or butter to 
make it " shape," and formed into 
rolls about the size of a finger. A 
short dough (made, say, of a pint 
of flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of lard, 1 
teaspoonful of baking powder, salt, 
and milk enough to mix) should be 
rolled thin, cut into strips, and folded 
about the meat rolls, care being taken 
to keep the shape regular. The rolls 
should be baked in a quick oven 



until they are a delicate brown color 
and served hot. 

Meat Turnovers. 

Almost any kind of chopped meat 
may be used in these, and if the 
quantity on hand is small may be 
mixed with potato or cooked rice. 
This filling should be seasoned to taste 
with salt and pepper, onion, or what- 
ever is relished, and laid on pieces of 
short biscuit dough rolled thin and 
cut into circles about the size of an 
ordinary saucer. The edges of the 
dough should be moistened with white 
of an egg, the dough then folded over 
the meat, and its edges pinched 
closely together. If desired, the tops 
of the turnovers may be brushed over 
with the yolk of egg before they are 
placed in the oven. About half an 
hour's baking in a hot oven is re- 
quired. Serving with a brown sauce 
increases the flavor and moistens the 
crust. 



MEAT WITH MACARONI AND 
OTHER STARCHY MATERIALS 

Macaroni cooked with chojiped 
ham, hash made of meat and pota- 
toes, or meat and rice, meat cro- 
quettes — made of meat and some 
starchy materials like bread crumbs, 
cracker dust, or rice — are other fa- 
miliar examples of meat combined 
with starchy materials. Pilaf, a dish 
very common in the Orient and well 
known in the Lnited States, is of 
this character and easily made. 
When there is soup or soup stock on 
hand if it can be well used in the 
pilaf. 

Meat Cakes. 

1 pound chopped veal. 

i pound soaked bread crumbs. 

2 tablespoonfuls savory fat or 
butter. 

1 teaspooful chopped onion. 
IJ teaspoonful salt. 
Dash of pepper. 

Mix all the ingredients except the 
butter or fat and shape into small 
round cakes. Melt the fat in a bak- 
ing pan and brown the cakes in it, 
first one side and then the other. 



ECONOMICAL USE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 107 



Either cooked or raw veal may be 
used. In the case of raw meat the 
pan should be covered so that the 
heat may be retained to sotten the 
meat. 

Stew from Cold Roast. 

This dish provides a good way of 
using up the remnants of a roast, 
either of beef or mutton. The meat 
should be freed from fat, gristle, and 
bones, cut into small pieces, slightly 
salted, and put into a kettle with 
water enough to nearly cover it. It 
should simmer until almost ready to 
break in pieces, when onions and raw 
potatoes, peeled and quartered, 
should be added. A little soup stock 
may also be added if available. Cook 
until the potatoes are done, then 
thicken the liquor or gravy with 
flour. The stew may be attractively 
served on slices of crisp toast. 

Meat with Beans. 

Dry beans are very rich in protein, 
the percentage being fully as large 
as that in meat. Dry beans and other 
similar legumes are usually cooked 
in water, which they absorb, and so 
are diluted before serving; on the 
other hand, meats by the ordinary 
methods of cooking are usually de- 
prived of some of the water origi- 
nally present — facts which are often 
overlooked in discussing the matter. 
Nevertheless, when beans are served 
with meat the dish is almost as rich 
in protein as if it consisted entirely 
of meat. 

Pork and beans is such a well- 
known dish that recipes are not 
needed. Some cooks use a piece of 
corned mutton or a piece of corned 
beef in place of salt or corned pork 
or bacon or use butter or olive oil in 
preparing this dish. 

In the Southern States, where cow- 
peas are a common crop, they are 
cooked in the same way as dried 
beans. Cowpeas baked with salt pork 
or bacon make an excellent dish re- 
sembling pork and beans, but of dis- 
tictive flavor. Cowpeas boiled with 
ham or with bacon are also well- 
known and palatable dishes. 

Recipes are here given for some 
less common meat and bean dishes: 



Mexican Beef. 

The Mexicans have a dish known as 
" Chili con carne " (meat with Chili 
pepper), the ingredients for which one 
would doubtless have diflBculty in 
obtaining except in the southwestern 
United States. However, a good sub- 
stitute for it may be made with the 
foods available in all parts of the 
country. The Mexican recipe is as 
follows: 

Remove the seeds from two Chili 
peppers, soak the pods in a pint of 
warm water until they are soft, 
scrape the pulp from the skin and 
add to the water. Cut two pounds 
of beef into small pieces and brown 
in butter or drippings. Add a clove 
of garlic and the Chili water. Cook 
until the meat is tender, renewing 
the water if necessary. Thicken the 
sauce with flour. Serve with Mexi- 
can beans either mixed with the meat 
or used as a border. 

In the absence of the Chili pep- 
pers, water and Cayenne pepper may 
be used, and onions may be substi- 
tuted for garlic. For the Mexican 
beans, red kidney beans either fresh 
or canned make a good substitute. 
If the canned beans are used they 
should be drained and heated in a 
little savory fat or butter. The 
liquid may be added to the meat 
while it is cooking. If the dried 
beans are used they should be soaked 
until soft, then cooked in water un- 
til tender and rather dry, a little 
butter or dripping and salt being used 
for seasoning or gravy. White or 
dried Lima beans may be used in a 
similar way. 

Haricot of Mutton. 

2 tablespoonfuls of chopped 

onions. 
2 tablespoonfuls of butter or 

drippings. 
2 cups of water, and salt and 

pepper. 
IJ pounds of lean mutton or 

lamb cut into 2-inch pieces. 

Fry the onions in the butter, add 
the meat, and brown; cover with 
water and cook until the meat is ten- 
der. Serve with a border of Lima 
beans, seasoned with salt, pepper. 



108 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



butter, and a little chopped parsley. 
Fresh, canned, dried, or evaporated 
Lima beans may be used in making 
this dish. 

Roast Pork with Cowpeas. 

For this dish a leg of young pork 
should be selected. With a sharp 
knife make a deep cut in the knuckle 
and fill the opening with sage, pep- 
per, salt, and chopped onion. When 
the roast is half done scar the skin 
but do not cut deeper tlian the outer 
rind. When the meat is nearly 
cooked pour off the excess of fat 
and add a quart of white cowpeas 
which have been previously parboiled 
or " hulled " and cook slowly until 
quite done and the meat is brown. 
Apple sauce may be served with this 
dish. 

Heat Salads. 

Whether meat salads are economi- 
cal or not depends upon the way in 
which the materials are utilized. If 
in chicken salad, for example, only 
the white meat of chickens especially 
bought for the purpose and only the 
inside stems of expensive celery are 
used, it can hardly be cheaper than 
plain chicken. But, if portions of 
meat left over from a previous serv- 
ing are mixed with celery grown at 
home, they certainly make an eco- 
nomical dish, and one very acceptable 
to most persons. Cold roast pork or 
tender veal — in fact, any white meat 
can be utilized in the same way. 
Apples cut into cubes may be sub- 
stituted for part of the celery; many 
cooks consider that with the apple 
the salad takes the dressing better 
than with the celery alone. Many 
also prefer to marinate (i. e., mix 
with a little oil and vinegar) the 
meat and celery or celery and ap- 
ples before putting in the final dress- 
ing, which may be eitlier mayonnaise 
or a good boiled dressing. 

Meat with Eggs. 

Occasionally eggs are combined 
with meat, making very nutritious 
dishes. W^hether this is an economy 
or not of course depends on the 
comparative cost of eggs and meat. 

In general, it may be said that 



eggs are cheaper food than meat when 
a dozen cost less than li pounds of 
meat, for a doxen eggs weigh about 
li pounds and the proportions of pro- 
tein and fat which they contain are 
not far different from the proportions 
of these nutrients in the average cut 
of meat. When eggs are 30 cents a 
dozen they compare favorably with a 
round of beef at 20 cents a pound. 

Such common dishes as ham and 
eggs, bacon or salt pork and eggs, and 
omelette with minced ham or other 
meat are familiar to all cooks. 

Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding. 

The beef is roasted as usual and 
the pudding made as follows: 

Yorkshire Pudding. 
3 eggs. 
1 pint milk. 
1 cupful flour. 
1 teaspoonful salt. 

Beat the eggs until very light, then 
add the milk. Pour the mixture over 
the flour, add the salt, and beat well. 
Bake in hissing hot gem pans or in 
an ordinary baking pan for forty- 
five minutes, and baste with drip- 
pings from the beef. If gem pans 
are used, they should be placed on 
a dripping pan to jirotect the floor 
of the oven from the fat. Many 
cooks prefer to bake Yorkshire pud- 
ding in the pan with the meat; in this 
case the roast should be placed on a 
rack and the pudding batter poured 
on the pan under it. 

Corned Beef Hash with Poached 
Eggs. 

A dish popular with many persons 
is corned beef hash with poached 
eggs on top of the hash. A slice of 
toast is sometimes used imder the 
hash. This suggests a way of utiliz- 
ing the small amount of corned-beef 
hash which would otherwise be insuf- 
ficient for a meal. 

Housekeepers occasionally use up 
odd bits of other meat in a similar 
way, chopping and seasoning them 
and then warming and serving in in- 
dividual baking cups with a poached 
or shirred egg on each. 



ECONOMICAL USE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 109 



Ham and Poached Eggs with Cream 
Sauce. 

A more elaborate dish of meat and 
eggs is made by placing a piece of 
thinly sliced boiled ham on a round 
of buttered toast, a poached egg on 
the ham, and covering with a highly 
seasoned cream or a Hollandaise 
sauce. A slice of tongue may be used 
instead of the ham. If preferred, a 
well-seasoned and rather thick to- 
mato sauce or curry sauce may be 
used. 

Stuffing or rorcemeat. 

Another popular way to extend the 
flavor of meat over a large amount 
of food is by the use of stuflBng or 
forcemeat (a synonym more common 
in England than in the United 
States). As it is impossible to in- 
troduce much stuffing into some 
pieces of meat even if the meat is cut 
to make a pocket for it, it is often 
well to prepare more than can be put 
into the meat and to cook the re- 
mainder in the pan beside the meat. 
Some cooks cover the extra stuffing 
with buttered paper while it is cook- 
ing and baste it at intervals. 

Some recipes for meat dishes of 
this character follow, and others will 
be found in cook books. 

Mock Wild Duck. 

1 flank steak, or 

1^ pounds round steak cut ^-inch 
thick. 

2 lamb kidneys. 

i cup butter or drippings. 
i cup cracker crumbs. 

1 tablespoonful minced onion. 
Salt, pepper, and powdered 

thyme, sage or savory. 

2 tablespoonfuls flour, 
1 tablespoonful sugar. 

3 cupfuls water or stock. 

Trim the kidneys of all fat, cords, 
and veins. Cut into small pieces and 
spread evenly over one side of the 
steak together with the crumbs, onion, 
and seasonings. Roll and tie with a 
cord. Brown the roll in fat, then re- 
move and make a gravy by heating 
the flour in the fat and adding three 
cupfuls of stock or water and the 
sugar. Put the meat into the gravy 



and cook slowly until tender in a cov- 
ever baking dish, a steamer, or a fire- 
less cooker. If steamed or cooked in 
a fireless cooker, the roll should be 
browned in the oven before serving. 

Mock Duck. 

Mock duck is made by placing on 
a round steak a stuffing of bread 
crumbs well seasoned with chopped 
onions, butter, chopped suet or drip- 
ping, salt, pepper, and a little sage, 
if the flavor is relished. The steak 
is then rolled around the stuffing and 
tied with a string in several places. 
If the steak seems tough, the roll is 
steamed or stewed until tender be- 
fore roasting in the oven until brown. 
Or it may be cooked in a casserole or 
other covered dish, in which case a 
cupful or more of water or soup- 
stock should be poured around the 
meat. Mock duck is excellent served 
with currant or other acid jelly. 

Veal or Beef Birds. 

A popular dish known as veal or 
beef birds or by a variety of special 
names is made by taking small pieces 
of meat, each just large enough for 
an individual serving, and preparing 
them in the same way as the mock 
duck is jirepared. 

Sometimes variety is introduced by 
seasoning the stuffing with chopped 
olives or tomato. Many cooks pre- 
pare their " birds " by browning in a 
little fat, then adding a little water, 
covering closely and simmering until 
tender. 



UTILIZING THE CHEAPER CUTS 
OF MEAT IN PALATABLE DISHES 

When the housekeeper attempts to 
reduce her meat bill by using the less 
expensive cuts, she commonly has two 
difficulties to contend with — tough- 
ness and lack of flavor. It has been 
shown how prolonged cooking softens 
the connective tissues of the meat. 
Pounding the meat and chopping it 
are also employed with tough cuts, 
as they help to break the muscle 
fibers. As for flavor, the natural 
flavor of meat even in the least de- 
sirable cuts may be developed by care- 
ful cooking, notably by browning the

surface, and other flavors may be 
given by the addition of vegetables 
and seasoning with condiments of 
various kinds. 

Methods of preparing inexpensive 
meat dishes will be discussed and 
practical directions for them will be 
given in the following sections. As 
often ha])pens, two or three methods 
may be illustrated by the same dish, 
but the attempt has been made to 
group the recipes according to their 
most salient feature. 

Prolonged Cooking at Low Heat. 

Meat may be cooked in water in a 
number of ways without being allowed 
to reach the boiling point. With the 
ordinary kitchen range this is ac- 
complished by cooking on the cooler 
part of the stove rather than on the 
hottest part, directly over the fire. 
Experience with a gas stove, particu- 
larly if it has a small burner known 
as a " simmerer," usually enables the 
cook to maintain temperatures which 
are high enough to sterilize the meat 
if it has become accidentally contam- 
inated in any way and to make it 
tender without hardening the fibers. 
The double boiler would seem to be a 
neglected utensil for this purpose. 
Its contents can easily be kept up to 
a temperature of 200° F., and nothing 
will burn. Another method is by 
means of the fireless cooker. In this 
a high temperature can be maintained 
for a long time without the applica- 
tion of fresh heat. Still another 
method is by means of a closely cov- 
ered baking dish. Earthenware 
dishes of this kind suitable for serving 
foods as well as for cooking are 
known as casseroles. For cooking 
purposes a baking dish covered with 
a plate or a bean jar covered with a 
saucer may be substituted. The 
Aladdin oven has long been popular 
for the purpose of preserving tem- 
peratures which are near the boiling 
point and yet do not reach it. It fs 
a thoroughly insulated oven which 
may be heated by a kerosene lamp 
or a gas jet. 

In this connection directions are 
given for using some of the tough- 
est and least promising pieces of 
meat. 



Stewed Shin of Beef. 

4 pounds of shin of beef. 

1 medium sized onion. 

1 whole clove and a small bay 

leaf. 
1 sprig of parsley. 
IJ tablespoonfuls of flour, 

1 small slice of carrot. 
^ tablespoonful of salt. 

i teaspoonful of pepper. 

2 quarts of boiling water. 

1| tablespoonfuls of butter or 
savory drippings. 

Have the butcher cut the bone in 
several pieces. Put all the ingredients 
but the flour and butter into a stew- 
pan and bring to a boil. Set the pan 
where the liquid will just simmer for 
six hours, or after boiling for five or 
ten minutes, put all into the fireless 
cooker for eight or nine hours. With 
the butter, flour, and one-half cupful 
of the clear soup from which the fat 
has been removed, make a brown 
sauce; to this add the meat, the mar- 
row removed from the bone. Heat 
and serve. The remainder of the 
liquid in which the meat has been 
cooked may be used for soup. 

Sour Beef. 

Take a piece of beef from the 
rump or the lower round, cover wnth 
vinegar or with a half-and-half mix- 
ture of vinegar and water, add sliced 
onion, bay leaves, and a few mixed 
whole spices and salt. Allow to stand 
a week in winter or three or four days 
in summer; turn over once a day and 
keep covered. When ready to cook, 
brown the meat in fat, using an 
enameled iron pan, strain the liquid 
over it and cook until tender; thicken 
the gravy with flour or ginger snaps 
(which may be broken up first), strain 
it, and pour over the sliced meat. 
Some cooks add cream. 

Boiled Beef with Horse-radish Sauce. 
Plain boiled beef may also be served 
•with horse-radish sauce, and makes a 
palatable dish. A little chopped 
parsley sprinkled over the meat when 
served is considered an improvement 
by many persons. For the sake of 
variety the meat may be browned like 
pot roast before serving. 



ECONOMICAL USE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 111 



Farmer Stew. 

Pound flour into both sides of a 
round steak, using as much as the 
meat will take up. This may be done 
with a meat pounder or with the edge 
of a heavy plate. Fry in drippings, 
butter, or other fat in a Scotch bowl, 
or if more convenient in an ordinary 
iron kettle or a frying pan; then add 
water enough to cover it. Cover the 
dish very tightly so that the steam 
can not escape and allow the meat to 
simmer for two hours or until it is 
tender. One advantage of this dish is 
that ordinarily it is ready to serve 
when the meat is done as the gravy 
is already thickened. However, if a 
large amount of fat is used in the 
frying, the gravy may not be thick 
enough and must be blended with 
flour. 

Stuffed Heart. 

Wash the heart thoroughly inside 
and out, stuff with the following mix- 
ture, and sew up the opening: One 
cup broken bread dipped in fat and 
browned in the oven, 1 chopped onion, 
and salt and pepper to taste. 

Cover the heart with water and 
simmer until tender or boil ten min- 
utes and set in the tireless cooker for 
six or eight hours. Remove from the 
water about one-half hour before 
serving. Dredge with flour, pepper, 
and salt, or sprinkle with crumbs and 
bake until brown. 

Braised Beef, Pot Roast, and Beef 
k la Mode. 

The above names are given to dishes 
made from the less tender cuts of 
meat. They vary little either in com- 
position or method of preparation. 
In all cases the meat is browned on 
the outside to increase the flavor and 
then cooked in a small amount of 
water in a closely covered kettle or 
other receptacle until tender. The 
flavor of the dish is secured by brown- 
ing the meat and by the addition 
of the seasoning vegetables. Many 
recipes suggest that the vegetables be 
removed before serving and the liquid 
be thickened. As the vegetables are 
usually extremely well seasoned by 
means of the browned fat and the ex- 



tracts of the meat, it seems unfortu- 
nate not to serve them. 

Of course, the kind, quality, and 
shape of the meat all play their part 
in the matter. Extra time is needed 
for meats with a good deal of sinew 
and tough fibers such as the tough 
steaks, shank cuts, etc.; and natu- 
rally a fillet of beef, or a steak from 
a prime cut will take less time than 
a thick piece from the shin. Such 
dishes require more time and per- 
haps more skill in their preparation 
and may involve more expense for 
fuel than the more costly cuts, which 
like chops or tender steaks may be 
quickly cooked, but to the epicure, as 
well as to the average man, they are 
palatable when rightly prepared. 

^ean-pot Roast. 

3 pounds mutton (shoulder), or 
3 pounds round, or chuck steak. 
1 cup carrots cut into small 

pieces. 
1 cup potatoes cut into small 

pieces. 

1 cup sliced onion. 

Cover the meat with boiling water. 
Place the cover on the bean pot and 
let the meat cook in a moderate oven 
for two hours; then add the vegeta- 
bles cut in half-inch cubes, with 2 tea- 
spoonfuls salt; cook until the vegeta- 
bles are tender, which will require 
about one hour; then serve, pouring 
a sauce over the meat, made from 1 
cup of the liquid in which the meat 
was cooked, thickened with 2 table- 
spoonfuls of flour, 

Hungarian Goulash. 

2 pounds top round of beef. 
A little flour. 

2 ounces salt pork. 
2 cups tomatoes. 
1 stalk celery. 

1 onion. 

2 bay leaves. 

6 whole cloves. 
6 peppercorns, 
1 blade mace. 

Cut the beef into 2-inch pieces and 
sprinkle with flour; fry the salt pork 
until light brown; add the beef and 
cook slowly for about thirty-five min- 



112 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



utes, stirring occasionally. Cover 
with water and simmer about two 
hours; season with salt and pepper or 
paprika. 

From the vegetables and spices a 
sauce is made as follows: Cook in 
sufficient water to cover for twenty 
minutes ; then rub through a sieve, and 
add to some of the stock in which the 
meat was cooked. Thicken with flour, 
using 2 tablespoonfuls (moistened 
with cold water) to each cup of 
liquid, and season with salt and pa- 
prika. 

Serve the meat on a platter with 
the sauce poured over it. Potatoes, 
carrots, and green peppers cooked un- 
til tender, and cut into small pieces 
or narrow strips, are usually sprinkled 
over the dish when served, and 
noodles may be arranged in a border 
upon the platter. 

Goulash is a Hungarian dish which 
has come to be a favorite in the 
United States. 

Casserole Cookery. 

A casserole is a heavy earthenware 
dish with a cover. A substitute for it 
can easily be improvised by using 
any heavy earthenware dish with a 
heavy plate for the cover. A casser- 
ole presentable enough in appearance 
to be put on the table serves the 
double purpose of baking and serving 
dish. 

A suitable cut of beef or veal, and 
it may well be one of the cheaper cuts, 
as the long, slow cooking insures 
tenderness, may be cooked in a casser- 
ole. 

Poultry and other meats besides 
beef or veal can be cooked in this 
manner. Chicken cooked in a casser- 
ole, which is a favorite and expensive 
dish in good hotels and restaurants, 
may be easily prepared in the home, 
and casserole cookery is to be recom- 
mended for tough chicken. 

The heat must be moderate and the 
cooking must occupy a long time. 
Hurried cooking in a casserole is out 
of the question. If care is taken in 
this particular, and suitable season- 
ings are used, few who know any- 
thing of cooking should go astray. 

Chojiped meat also may be cooked 
in a casserole and this utensil is par- 



ticularly useful for the purpose, be- 
cause the food is served in the same 
dish in which it is cooked and may 
easily be kept hot, a point which is 
im])ortant with chopped meats, which 
usually cool rapidly. 

Casserole Koast. 

3 or 4 pounds or round or rump 

of beef. 
A slice of salt pork. 
A few pep])ercorns. 
One-fourth each of a carrot, a 
turnip, an onion, and a head of 
celery cut into small pieces. 

Try out the pork. Brown the meat 
on both sides in the fat. Put in a 
casserole with the vegetables around 
it, add 2 cupfuls of water or stock. 
Cover and cook in a hot oven three 
hours, basting occasionally. A sauce 
or gravy can be made with water, 
flour, and some of the juice left in 
the casserole. 

Casserole or Italian Hash. 

Boil one-fourth pound of macar- 
oni, drain and put into a buttered 
casserole, add a little butter and 
grated cheese. Push the macaroni to 
the sides of the dish and fill the center 
with chopped cooked meat seasoned 
to suit the taste of the family. A 
little sausage gives a good flavor to 
this dish. Place in the oven until hot 
throughout and serve. 

A very good modification of this is 
made by using raw instead of cooked 
meat. For this one-half pound of 
round steak is sufficient for a family 
of six. This should be cut into small 
pieces, browned, and cooked until 
tender in water with the onions and 
other seasonings. An hour before the 
cooking is complete, add one-half can 
of tomatoes. Before serving, the 
meat may be mixed with the sauce, 
and the whole is poured over the mac- 
aroni. 

MEAT COOKED WITH VINEGAR 

Dishes of similar sort as regards 
cooking, but in which vinegar is used 
to give flavor as well as to soften the 
meat and make it tender, are the 
following : 



ECONOMICAL USE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 113 



Spanish Beefsteak. 

Take a piece of round steak weigh- 
ing 2 pounds and about an inch thick; 
pound until thin, season with salt and 
Cayenne pepper, cover with a layer 
of bacon or salt pork, cut into thin 
slices, roll and tie with a cord. Pour 
around it half a cupful of milk and 
half a cupful of water. Place in a 
covered baking dish and cook two 
hours, basting occasionally. 

Sour Beefsteak. 

Round steak may be cooked in 
water in which there is a little vine- 
gar, or if the time is sufficient, it may 
be soaked for a few hours in vinegar 
and water and then cooked in a cas- 
serole or in some similar way. 

POUNDED MEAT 

Pounding meat before cooking is an 
old-fashioned method of making it 
tender, but while it has the advantage 
of breaking down the tough tissues it 
has the disadvantage of being likely 
to drive out the juices and with them 
the flavor. A very good way of es- 
caping this difficulty is pounding flour 
into the meat; this catches and retains 
the juices. Below are given the 
recipes for two palatable dishes in 
which this is done: 

CHOPPED MEAT 

Chopping meat is one of the prin- 
cipal methods of making tough and 
inexpensive meat tender, i. e., dividing 
it finely and thus cutting the con- 
nective tissue into small bits. Such 
meats have another advantage in that 
they may be cooked quickly and 
economically. 

In broiling chopped meat the fact 
should be kept in mind that there is 
no reason why it should not be cooked 
like the best and most expensive ten- 
derloin. The only reason that ever 
existed for difference in treatment 
was the toughness of the connective 
tissue, and this feature has been over- 
come by the chopping. The ideal to 
be reached in broiling steak is to sear 
the surface very quickly, so that the 
juices which contain the greater part 
of the flavoring of the meat shall be 



kept in, and then to allow the heat to 
penetrate to the inside until the whole 
mass is cooked to the taste of the 
family. To pass the point where the 
meat ceases to be puffy and juicy and 
becomes flat and hard is very unde- 
sirable, as the palatability is then lost. 
Exactly the same ideal should be kept 
in mind in broiling chopped meat. If 
this were always done, hard, compact, 
tasteless balls or cakes of meat would 
be served less often. To begin with, 
the broiler should be even more care- 
fully greased than for a whole steak. 
This makes it possible to form the 
balls or cakes of chopped meat with 
very little pressure without running 
the risk of having them pulled to 
pieces by adhering to the wires of the 
broiler. They should be heated on 
both sides even more quickly than 
the steak, because the chopping has 
provided more ways of escape for the 
juice, and these openings should be 
sealed as soon as possible. The in- 
terior should be cooked to the taste 
of the family just as the steak is. 

In regard to broiling it may in- 
cidentally be noted that housekeepers 
often make themselves unnecessary 
work when broiling under gas by 
allowing the juice from steaks or 
meat balls to drop into the large pan 
under the rack. A smaller pan set in 
the larger one may be made to catch 
all the juice and fat and is much 
easier to wash. It serves also to 
economize the gravy. 

Chopped raw meat of almost any 
kind can be very quickly made into 
a savory dish by cooking it with 
water or with water and milk for a 
short time, then thickening with but- 
ter and flour, and adding different 
seasonings as relislied, either pepper 
and salt alone, or onion juice, celery, 
or tomato. Such a dish may be made 
to " go further " by serving it on toast 
or with a border of rice or in some 
similar combination. 

Tough Portions of Porterhouse 
Steak. 

Before speaking of the cooking of 
the cuts that lack tenderness through- 
out, it may be well to refer to the 
fact that the flank end of the porter- 
house is to be classed with the tough- 



114 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



est of cuts and with those which, 
when cooked alone, are with difficulty 
made tender even by long heating. 
Mocli duck, which is commonly made 
out of flank steak, can be rendered 
tender enough to be palatable only 
by long steaming or cooking in water 
and yet people quite generally broil 
this part of the steak with the tender- 
loin and expect it to be eaten. The 
fact is that to broil this part of the 
porterhouse steak is not good man- 
agement. It is much more profitable 
to put it into the soup kettle or to 
make it into a stew. In families 
where most of the members are away 
during the day the latter is a good 
plan, for the end of a steak makes a 
good stew for two or three people. 
This may be seasoned with vegetables 
left from dinner, or two or three 
olives cut up in gravy will give a 
very good flavor; or a few drops of 
some one of the bottled meat sauces, 
if the flavor is relished, or a little 
Chili sauce may be added to the stew. 
But if the tough end of a porterhouse 
is needed with the rest, a good plan is 
to put it through a meat grinder, 
make it into balls, and broil it with 
the tender portions. Each member 
of the family can then be served with 
a piece of the tenderloin and a meat 
ball. If the chopped meat is seasoned 
with a little onion juice, grated lemon 
rind, or chopped parsley, a good 
flavor is imparted to the gravy. 

Hamburg Steak. 

This name is commonly given to in- 
expensive cuts of beef chopped, sea- 
soned a little, shaped into small balls 
or into one large thin cake, and 
quickly broiled in the way that a 
tender steak would be. Owing to 
the quick cooking much of the 
natural flavor of the meat is de- 
veloped and retained. The fact 
should be kept in mind that Hamburg 
steak must be made from fresh, well- 
ground meat. It is much safer to 
chop the meat at home, as chopped 
meat spoils very quickly. Much de- 
pends, too, upon browning it suffi- 
ciently to bring out the flavors. 
Many cooks think that Hamburg 
steak is improved if the meat is mixed 
with milk before it is cooked. 



In some parts of the country, and 
particularly in some of the Southern 
States, two kinds of beef are on 
sale. One is imported from other 
parts of the country and is of higher 
price. The other, known locally as 
" native beef," is sometimes lacking in 
flavor and in fat and is usually 
tougher. Southern native beef such 
as is raised in Florida is almost in- 
variably, however, of extremely good 
flavor, due presumably to the feed or 
other conditions under which it is 
raised. By choj)ping such meat and 
cooking it as Hamburg steak, a dish 
almost as palatable as the best cuts of 
the more expensive beef may be ob- 
tained. In such cases, however, it is 
desirable because of the low percent- 
age of fat to add suet or butter to 
the meat. The reason for this is that 
in the cooking the water of the juice 
when unprotected by fat evaporates 
too quickly and leaves the meat dry. 
This may be prevented by adding egg 
as well as fat, for the albumen of the 
egg hardens quickly and tends to keep 
in the juices. The proportion should 
be 1 egg to IJ pounds of meat. 

Savory Rolls. 

Savory rolls in great variety are 
made out of chopped meat either with 
or without egg. The variety is se- 
cured by the flavoring materials used 
and by the sauces with which the 
baked rolls are served. A few recipes 
will be given below. While these def- 
inite directions are given it should be 
remembered that a few general princi- 
ples borne in mind make recipes un- 
necessary and make it possible to util- 
ize whatever may happen to be on 
hand. Appetizing rolls are made with 
beef and pork mixed. The proportion 
varies from two parts of beef and 
one of pork to two of pork and one of 
beef. The rolls are always improved 
by laying thin slices of salt pork or 
bacon over them, which keep the sur- 
face moistened with fat during the 
roasting. These slices should be 
scored on the edge, so that they will 
not curl up in cooking. The neces- 
sity for the salt pork is greater when 
the chopped meat is chiefly beef than 
when it is largely pork or veal. 
Bread crumbs or bread moistened in 



ECONOMICAL USE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 115 



water can always be added, as it helps 
to make the dish go farther. When 
onions, green peppers, or other veg- 
etables are used, they should always 
be thoroughly cooked in fat before 
being put in the roll, for usually they 
do not cook sufficiently in the length 
of time it takes to cook the meat. 
Sausage makes a good addition to the 
roU, but it is usually cheaper to use 
unseasoned pork meat with the ad- 
dition of a little sage. 

Cannelon of Beef. 

This dish is prepared by making 
chopped beef into a roll and baking it 
wrapped in a buttered paper, a 
method designed to keep in the steam 
and so insure a moist, tender dish. 
The paper must be removed before 
serving. The roll should be basted 
occasionally with butter and water 
or drippings and water. In prepar- 
ing the roll an egg may be added, for 
eacn pound and a half of meat, and 
chopped parsley, onion juice, lemon 
peel, or finely chopped green peppers 
make good seasoning. A thickened 
gravy may be made from the drip- 
pings, the liquid used being either 
water or tomato juice. 

Strips of pork laid on the roll may 
be substituted for the buttered paper 
and basting. 

Filipino Beef. 

1 pound roimd beef. 

i pound lean fresh pork. 

1 small onion. 

1 one green pepper. 

1 teaspoonful of salt. 

1 cup of soft stale bread crumbs. 

1 egg. 

3 cups of stewed tomatoes. 

2 slices of bacon. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter. 
4> tablespoonfuls of flour. 

Remove the seeds from the pepper 
and put it through the meat grinder 
with the meats and the onion. Add 
crumbs, egg, and salt. INIake into a 
roll, place in a shallow baking dish, 
pour the strained tomatoes around it, 
put the bacon on top, and bake forty 
minutes, basting with the tomatoes. 
Thicken the gravy with the flour 
cooked in the butter, A little season- 



ing such as a bit of bay leaf, a clove, 
and a small piece of onion improves 
the tomato sauce. As the pepper and 
onion are not likely to be cooked as 
soon as the meat, it is well to fry them 
in a little fat before adding to the 
other ingredients. 

This dish will serve 6 to 8 people. 
When the meat is 20 cents a pound 
and every other item is valued at 
usual town market prices, the dish 
costs about 50 cents. If the meat 
costs only 10 cents per pound and 
vegetables from the garden are used 
the initial cost of the dish will be 
small. Since no vegetable except po- 
tatoes or rice need be served with this 
dish, it may be said to answer the 
purpose of both meat and vegetable. 

Mock Rabbit. 

i pound round steak, and 
1 pound sausage; 

or 
1 pound round steak, and 
i pound sausage meat. 
3 slices of bread moistened with 

water. 
1 egg. 
1 onion. 

i pound salt pork. 
Pepper and salt. 

Chop the meat. Chop the onion and 
cook (but do not brown) it in the fat 
tried out of a small portion of the 
pork. Add the bread and cook a few 
minutes. When this is cool, mix all 
the ingredients and form into a long 
round roll. The surface can easily be 
made smooth if the hand is wet with 
cold water. Lay the remaining pork 
cut in thin slices on top and bake 
forty minutes in a hot oven. The 
sausage may be omitted if desired 
and other seasoning used. 

Veal Loaf. 

3 pounds veal. 

1 pound salt pork. 

6 soda crackers rolled fine. 

3 eggs well beaten. 

i teaspoonful pepper. 

i teaspoonful salt. 

Chop the meat mixed with the other 
ingredients, shape, and bake three 
hours, basting occasionally with pork 



116 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



fat. Use one-fourth cut of fat for 
this purpose. If the roll is pierced 
occasionally the fat will penetrate 
more effectually. Veal loaf may also 
be cooked in bread pans. Some per- 
sons cook the veal before chopping. 

DEVELOPING AND IMPROVING 
FLAVOR OF MEAT 

Tiie typical meat flavors are very 
palatable to most persons, even when 
they are constantly tasted, and con- 
sequently the better cuts of meat in 
which they are well developed can be 
cooked and served without attention 
being paid especially to flavor. Care- 
ful cooking aids in developing the nat- 
ural flavor of some of the cheaper 
cuts, and such a result is to be sought 
wherever it is possible. Browning 
also brings out flavors agreeable to 
most palates. Aside from these two 
ways of increasing the flavor of the 
meat itself there are countless ways of 
adding flavor to otherwise rather 
tasteless meats. The flavors may be 
added in preparing the meat for cook- 
ing, as in various seasoned dishes al- 
ready described, or they may be sup- 
plied to cooked meat in the form of 
sauces. 

Retaining- Natural Flavor. 

As has already been pointed out, it 
is extremely diflBcult to retain the 
flavor-giving extractives in a piece of 
meat so tough as to require prolonged 
cooking, it is sometimes partially ac- 
complished by first searing the ex- 
terior of the meat and thus preventing 
the escape of the juices. Another de- 
vice, illustrated by the following 
recipe, is to let them escape into the 
gravy which is served with the meat 
itself. A similar principle is applied 
when roasts are basted with their own 
juice. 

Round Steak on Biscuits. 

Cut round steak into pieces about 
one-half inch scjuare, cover with water 
and cook it at a temperature just be- 
low the boiling point until it is tender, 
or boil for five minutes, and while 
still hot put into the fireless cooker 
and leave it for five hours. Thicken 
the gravy with flour mixed with water. 



allowing 2 level tablespoonfuls to a 
cup of water. Pour the meat and 
gravy over split baking powder bis- 
cuits so baked that they have a large 
amoimt of crust. 

Flavor of Browned Meat or Fat. 

Next to tiie unchanged flavor of the 
meat itself comes the flavor which is 
secured by browning the meat with 
fat. The outside slices of roast meat 
have this browned flavor in marked 
degree. Except in the case of roasts, 
browning for flavor is usually accom- 
plished by heating the meat in a fry- 
ing pan in fat which has been tried 
out of pork or in suet or butter. 
Care should be taken that the fat is 
not scorched. Fat in itself is a very 
valuable food, and the objection to 
fried foods because they may be fat 
seems illogical. Many housekeepers 
cook bacon in the oven on a wire 
broiler over a pan and believe it more 
wholesome than fried bacon. The 
reason, of course, is that thus cooked 
in the oven there is less chance for the 
bacon becoming impregnated with 
burned fat. ^^^lere fried salt pork 
is much used good cooks know that it 
must not be cooked over a very hot 
fire, even if they have never heard of 
the chemistry of burned fat. The 
recipe for bean-pot roast and other 
similar recipes may be varied by 
browning the meat or part of it be- 
fore covering with water. This re- 
sults in keeping some of the 
natural flavoring within the meat it- 
self and allowing less to go into the 
gravy. The flavor of veal can be 
very greatly improved in this way. 

The following old-fashioned dishes 
made with pork owe their savoriness 
chiefly to the flavor of browned fat 
or meat: 

Salt Pork with Milk Gravy. 

Cut salt or cured pork into thin 
slices. If very salt, cover with hot 
water and allow it to stand for ten 
minutes. Score the rind of the slices 
and fry slowly until they are a golden 
brown. Make a milk gravy by heat- 
ing flour in the fat that has been tried 
out, allowing 2 tablespoonfuls of fat 
and 2 tablespoonfuls of flour to each 
cup of milk. This is a good way to 



ECONOMICAL USE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 117 



use skim milk, which is as rich in pro- 
tein as whole milk. The pork and 
milk gravy served with boiled or 
baked potatoes makes a cheap and 
simple meal, but one that most people 
like very much. Bacon is often used 
in place of salt pork in making this 
dish. 

Fried Salt Pork with Salt Codfish 
or " Salt-Fish Dinner." 
I pound salf pork. 

1 pound codfish. 

2 cups of milk (skim milk will 
do). 

4 tablespoonfuls flour. 
A speck of salt. 

Cut the codfish into strips, soak in 
lukewarm water and then cook in 
water until tender but do not allow 
the water to come to the boiling 
point except for a very short time 
as prolonged boihng may make it 
tough. Cut the pork into one-fourth 
inch slices and cut several gashes in 
each piece. Fry very slowly until 
golden brown, and remove, pouring 
off the fat. Out of 4 tablespoonfuls 
of the fat, the flour, and the milk 
make a white sauce. Dish up the 
codfish with pieces of pork around 
it and serve with boiled potatoes and 
beets. Some persons serve the pork, 
and the fat from it, in a gravy boat 
so it can be added as i*elish. 

India Curry. 

li pounds veal. 

i cup of butter or drippings. 

2 onions or less. 

i tablespoonful curry or less. 

Brown meat either without fat or 
with very little and cut into small 
pieces. 

Fry the onions in the butter, re- 
move them, add the meat and curry 
powder. Cover the meat with boiling 
water and cook until tender. Serve 
with a border of rice. This dish is 
so savory that it can be made to go 



a long way by serving with a large 
amount of rice. The two onions and 
one-half tablespoonful of curry pow- 
der are the largest amount to be 
used. Many persons prefer less of 
each. 

in preparing the rice for this dish 
perhaps no better method can be 
given than the following: 

" Wash 1 cupful of rice in several 
waters, rubbing the grains between 
the hands to remove all the dirt. 
Put the washed rice in a stewpan 
with 2i cupfuls of water and 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt. Cover and place 
where the water will boil. Cook for 
twenty minutes, being careful not to 
let it burn. At the end of this time 
put the stewpan on a tripod or ring 
and cover the rice with a fold of 
cheese cloth. Let it continue to cook 
in this manner an hour, then turn 
into a hot vegetable dish. The rice 
will be tender, dry and sweet, and 
each grain will separate. During the 
whole process of cooking, the rice 
must not be stirred. If a table- 
spoonful of butter is cut up and 
scattered over the rice when it has 
cooked twenty minutes the dish will 
be very much improved." 

The butter is not necessary when 
the rice is served with India curry 
but may be included in dishes where 
less fat is used. 

Mock Venison. 

Cut cold mutton into thin slices 
and heat in a brown sauce made ac- 
cording to the following proportions: 

2 tablespoonfuls butter. 
2 tablespoonfuls flour. 
1 tablespoonful of bottled meat 
sauce (whichever is preferred). 
1 tablespoonful red currant jelly. 
1 cupful water or stock. 

Brown the flour in the butter, add 
the water or stock slowly, and keep 
stirring. Then add the jelly and 
meat sauce and let the mixture boil 
up well.

MARKETING FOR MEATS 

In regard to meat more than any 
other food, it pays the housewife to 
do her own marketing. A study of 
the cuts laid out on a butcher's stall 
often reveals something good and 
cheap, which would not have been 
thought of if one were giving her or- 
ders to a clerk or over the telephone. 
During the past few years meat has 
risen so steadily in price that roasts, 
chops, and steaks, on which the aver- 
age housekeeper was wont to rely, 
make a food bill appallingly high. 
But there are other pieces which by 
careful cooking produce very savory 
dishes. 

The good marketer ought, first of 
all, to know at a glance not only the 
various cuts but the appearance of 
good, wholesome meat. When first 
killed, a side of beef is reddish pur- 
ple, but it changes fast to a bright- 
red tint. The fat is a creamy-white 
color, not in chunks by itself but 
threaded, as it were, through the red. 
The whole ought to have a fresh, juicy 
appearance that tells it has hung long 
enough to become well ripened and 
fit for human food. 

Before beginning to consider cuts 
of meat, their price, their tenderness 
or toughness, try to imagine the ani- 
mal on its feet wandering about a 
grassy field in search of food. Like 
every other creature, it has a wonder- 
ful network of muscles. Some of 
these muscles work overtime, others 
get little usage. Therefore we find 



118 



the tenderest portions where the body 
has had little exercise — the flesh on 
top of the back, that long strip we 
call the tenderloin lying alongside of 
the spine, the poorterhouse, the seven 
prime ribs, as a butcher calls the 
thick sirloin, all cuts which are best 
adapted for broiling or roasting. 
Near the neck are the chuck ribs and 
shoulder, besides the tail and rump; 
then we come down to the round and 
the leg, portions of all creatures that 
abound in muscle. Where sinews are 
abundant and the flesh has a coarse- 
grained appearance, different meth- 
ods of cooking must be resorted to 
for such meat, if broiled or roasted, 
would be almost impossible to chew. 
It should be subjected to slow cook- 
ing, such as braising, pot roasting, or 
simmering just below the boiling 
point or to the moderate heat of a 
casserole. The nearer one approaches 
the hoof of the animal, the better is 
the meat adapted for soup making. 
The tendons of the shin are rich in 
gelatin, and when dissolved by long, 
slow cooking, give flavor and con- 
sistency to a soup. 

Beginning at the hoof of a creature, 
there is a piece which makes excel- 
lent soup. As we go farther up the 
loin, the meat begins to be of better 
flavor and the bone contains finer 
marrow. Then comes the round; from 
the top of it can be cut a really good 
steak. With a slight amount of 
pounding and marinating, this can be 
made almost as tender as a more ex- 
pensive cut. By marinating is meant 



BEEF AND LEFT-OVER BEEF DISHES 



119 



laying it in a mixture of oil and vine- 
gar in tlie coldest corner of tlie re- 
frigerator. Next comes the rump, 
from which stews and roasts are cut. 
Then ths sirloin, which contains the 
best steaks and roasts. From this 
portion is cut the tenderloin, a fine 
strip of tender meat that lies inside 
the bone. This bit of the creature 
does not receive the slightest exercise. 
It is therefore a delicate morsel, 
which sells from fifty to eighty cents 
a pound, according to the demand 
for it. I have bought it in country 
places as cheap as twenty-five cents 
a pound, while in New York it often 
brings ninety cents. Although de- 
liciously tender, it does not possess 
the flavor and nourishment of a 
cheaper piece of steak. 

Now we come to the forequarter, 
which begins at the five prime ribs 
for roasting. Close to them lie the 
five chuck ribs, excellent cuts for 
stews and small steaks. The neck is 
generally converted into Hamburg 
steak, while the under part of the 
animal, which includes the flank, 
plate, navel, and brisket, are corned. 
Here also is the shoulder clod; no 
cut can excel it in juiciness and 
flavor when a pot roast or beef k 
la mode is desired. 

For the housewife anxious to have 
a small income provide the best food 
possible, there are any number of 
pieces that make a savory dish, pro- 
vided they are cooked in the way 
which best fits them. A cut from 
the top of the round marinated as 
above suggested, and broiled gives an 
excellent steak. A cheaper piece of 
round, from farther down the leg, 
may be put through the chopper; 
broiled, it is good as Hamburg steak; 
baked, it makes a savory cannelon. 
A cut from the rump may be braised 
and is as appetizing hot as cold. A 
pound or two of rump is the base for 
a nourishing stew, while a braised or 
boiled tongue affords one hot meal 
and several lunch dishes. An ox tail 
is delicious fricasseed or in soup. 

Pot roasting converts a number of 
cheap cuts into excellent dishes. 
Among these are the juicy, lean cross 
ribs, or a solid piece from the lower 
part of the round or face of the 



rump. Two pounds of flank, which 
costs ten or twelve cents a pound, is 
very good when cooked a la aMUihi- 
aise. Roll the meat, saute it brown, 
season well, and braise slowly for two 
hours with enough water to make a 
good gravy. 

A sheep's liver is as highly es- 
teemed in England as calf's liver is 
here. In American markets it is al- 
most given away. If liver looks 
cloudy, or a heart and kidney have a 
streaky, spotted appearance, you may 
be sure they are diseased and will 
make dangerous food. When cut 
from a well-nourished, healthy ani- 
mal, they are smooth, red, and juicy. 
A calf's heart is a most appetizing 
dish larded, stuffed with a well-sea- 
soned dressing, roasted, and served 
with rich brown gravy. 

There is a knack in picking out a 
soup bone as well as in knowing how 
to cook it. It ought to be two thirds 
meat, one third bone and fat. If one 
has a large family, the best method 
to follow in winter when making 
soup, is to purchase two pieces of 
shin, one heavy with meat, the other 
bone and gristle. These must be 
cooked very slowly. When tender, 
take out the meat, separating It 
from the bone and gristle, which may 
be left to cook until all the good is 
out of it. The meat makes a good 
hash or stew and is not to be depised 
for croquettes. Fifty cents' worth of 
shin (when there is no waste) yields 
several nourishing meals in the shape 
of stew, hash, gelatine, and soup. 

It will pay a housewife who caters 
to a large family to purchase a set 
of butcher's tools. They cost several 
dollars, but within a year she can 
save the price of them by getting 
pieces of meat, during the winter at 
least, big enough to make a number 
of meals. Of course cold-storage 
room is a necessity. For instance, in 
the course of two weeks, a quarter of 
nmtton can be utilized in a good-sized 
household. The first part to be used 
is the flank, because its keeping quali- 
ties are not so good as other parts of 
the quarter. Cut off the small end 
of the ribs, leaving the loin chops and 
the rib quite short. The loin can 
then be hung in a cold pantry. The 



120 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



flank will make several quarts of fine 
mutton stock as well as a stew. In 
this Wciy, one may have at a moder- 
ate cost the chops for which a butcher 
charges fancy i)rices, besides a num- 
ber of other cuts, which, although not 
quite as choice, make excellent dishes 
when properly cooked. Beef, pork, 
and veal in large cuts may also be 
purchased during the winter and cut 
by the housewife to suit her needs. 
An accommodating butcher will gen- 
erally be willing to give his customer 
a lesson on how to divide meat, and 
with sharp tools any woman can ac- 
complish it. 

Roast Beef. 

Use, if possible, a covered roaster 
for cooking any sort of meat. The re- 
sult is a much more savory roast and 
less shrinkage. Wipe the meat, set it 
in a dripping pan, skin side down, 
rub with salt and pepper, then dredge 
with flour. Have the oven as hot as 
possible when it is put in, so the out- 
side will sear quickly and prevent the 
escape of the meat juice. As soon as 
the flour in the pan is brown, reduce 
the heat and baste with the fat, 
which has flowed from the roast. 
When the meat is half done, turn it 
on the other side and dredge with 
flour. Should there be the slightest 
appearance of flour in the pan turn- 
ing black, add a little water and baste 
every fifteen minutes until done, al- 
lowing one hour for each five pounds 
if the meat is desired rare or an hour 
and twenty minutes, if you wish it 
well done. 

Roast-Beef Gravy. 

Pour off fat, leaving four table- 
spoonfuls in pan; add four table- 
spoons flour and brown, stirring all 
the time. Add two cupfuls boiling 
water; salt and pepper to taste, and 
cook until smooth. Boil two min- 
utes, strain and serve. 

Casserole of Beefsteak. 

Saut^ 3 sliced onions in a table- 
spoonful butter; put them into the 
casserole. Cut a steak, from the up- 
per side of the round, into pieces suit- 
able for one portion. Put them in 
the saute pan and sear on all sides. 



then in the casserole. Add a table- 
spoonful flour to the saut^ pan, let it 
brown, add li cupfuls water, and stir 
until thickened, season with salt, pep- 
\)L'v, and a tablespoonful chopped 
parsley. Add a little Worcestershire 
sauce and mushroom catsup. The 
sauce will be richer if stock is used 
instead of water. Pour the sauce 
over the meat, cover the casserole, 
set in the oven, and cook slowly until 
the meat is tender, then cover the top 
with parboiled, sliced potatoes, and 
return to the oven to finish cooking 
the potatoes. Serve in the casserole. 

To Broil a Steak. 

Have the coals glowing hot, with- 
out flame or smoke, Grease a broiler 
with beef fat, place the steak in it, 
and hold it over the fire while count- 
ing ten slowly. Turn the broiler and 
hold the other side down for the same 
length of time. Turn the meat once 
in ten seconds for about one minute, 
or until it is well seared; then hold it 
farther from the fire, turning occa- 
sionally until the surface is brown. 
Just before taking it from the fire, 
sjirinkle with salt and pepper, turn- 
ing each side once more to the heat 
to cook the seasoning. When the 
steak is cooked, lay it on the platter, 
and spread both sides with butter. 

Braised Beef. 

3 pounds beef, 

2 ounces fat salt pork, 

2 tablespoonfuls flour, 

3 teaspoonfuls salt, 

^ teaspoonful pepper, 

li pints water, 

2 tablespoonfuls minced onion 

2 tablespoonfuls minced carrot, 

2 whole cloves, 

1 sprig parsley. 

Cut the pork into thin slices and 
fry until brown and crisp. Take out 
the pork, putting the vegetables in 
the fat remaining in the pan, and 
cook slowly fifteen minutes. Rub 
half the pepper and 2 tablespoonfuls 
salt into the piece of meat, and place 
it in a deej) graniteware pan. When 
the vegetables are cooked, put them 
with the meat, first pressing from 
them as much fat as possible. Into 



BEEF AND LEFT-OVER BEEF DISHES

the fat remaining in the pan put the 
flour, and stir until it becomes 
brown. Add the water gradually, 
stirring all the while. Season this 
gravy with the remainder of the salt 
and pepper, and boil for five min- 
utes; then pour over the meat in the 
pan. Add the cloves and parsley. 
Cover the pan and set in a very mod- 
erate oven. Cook for five hours, 
basting every half hour with the 
gravy in the pan. The oven must 
never be so hot that the gravy will 
bubble. — Maria Parloa. 

Beef Stew with Dumplings. 

2 pounds ujipcr part of round 
steak with the bone, 

3 pints boiling water, 
1 turnip, 

1 carrot, 

1 onion, 

i tablespoonful salt, 

i tablespoonful pepper, 

i bay leaf, 

i cupful flour for thickening. 

Cut meat in one-and-a-half inch 
pieces, wipe with a damp cloth, and 
sprinkle with a little salt and flour. 
Put some of the fat in a hot frying 
pan, and when tried out, add meat, 
turning often, till well browned. 
Then put in a kettle with the bones, 
add boiling water, rinsing out frying 
pan with some of it, that none of the 
goodness of the meat be wasted. Let 
meat boil for five minutes; then set 
back on the stove where water will 
just bubbles, and cook slowly for two 
hours. Then add onion, carrot, and 
turnip which have been cut in half- 
inch cubes, and cook for another 
hour. Twelve minutes before the 
stew is done, put dumplings on a per- 
forated tin pie plate, or in a steamer, 
cover closely, and do not lift the 
cover until stew is cooked. 

Or to have dumplings light in stew, 
drop the dumplings on top of the 
gently boiling stew, and leave the 
cover off until they have puffed up to 
twice their size. Then replace the 
cover and cook for fifteen minutes 
longer. If this is followed the 

Aimplings will never be soggy. 

' For additional suggestions and rec- 
ipes for dumplings consult the index. 



Corned Beef and Cabbage. 

Wash and, if very salt, soak in cold 
water for an hour a piece of corned 
beef weighing 5 or 6 pounds. Put 
in a kettle with cold water to cover, 
place on stove, heat slowly, taking 
off scum as it rises to the top of the 
water. Cook slowly for three or four 
hours, or till very tender. Take out 
the meat, and in the liquor cook a 
cabbage which has been prepared ac- 
cording to directions given in chap- 
ter on vegetables; also some potatoes 
that have been washed and pared. 
If beets are to be used, cook them in 
boiling water in a kettle by them- 
selves. When cabbage and potatoes 
are tender, take out with skimmer 
and serve with the meat. Save the 
fat that rises to the top. 

Fillet of Beef. 

Trim into shape, lard the upper 
side, dredge with salt, pepper, and 
flour. Put several pieces of pork in 
the pan under the meat, bake in a 
hot oven twenty or thirty minutes. 
Serve with mushroom sauce. Or brush 
the filet with beaten egg, sprinkle 
seasoned and buttered crumbs all 
over it, and bake thirty minutes. Or 
stuff the incisions left by the re- 
moval of the veins and tendons with 
any stufling or forcemeat. Dredge 
with salt and flour, and bake. — Mary 
J. Lincoln. 

Hamburg Steak. 

Two pounds round beef chopped 
fine; press it into a flat steak, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper and a 
little onion juice; flour lightly, and 
broil as beefsteak. Make a brown 
gravy with a little soup stock, thicken 
with flour, and pour around the steak. 

Steak a la Bordelaise (French rec- 
ipe). 

1 sirloin steak, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 
2 tablespoonfuls flour, 

2 cupfuls beef stock, 

2 tablespoonfuls chopped raw 

ham,

1 tablespoonful chopped onion. 
Salt and pepper to taste, 



122 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



1 tablespoonful tomato catsup, 

i cupful finely chopped mush- 
rooms. 

Brown the butter and flour, stir in 
the stock; when thick and smooth, 
add the ham, bay leaf, and onion. 
Cover and simmer gently for an hour, 
then strain. Add salt, pepper, cat- 
sup, and mushrooms, and keep hot at 
the side of the fire. Broil a sirloin 
steak, arrange on a hot platter, and 
pour this sauce around it. 

Beefsteak and Onions. 

Broil the steak over the fire, being 
careful to turn it often; after it is 
cooked, place on a hot platter and set 
in the oven with dabs of butter on it. 
Put a little finely chopped suet in a 
frying pan and fry light brown; into 
that place 3 onions sliced fine. Cover 
the pan and cook until tender, remove 
the cover and continue cooking until 
the onions are light brown. In serv- 
ing, pour the onions and gravy over 
the steak. 

Beefsteak Pie. 

3 pounds lean steak, 

Sweet thyme and parsley 

chopped fine, 
Peppers, 

2 onions, 

1 teaspoonful Worcestershire 

Sauce, 
6 hard-boiled eggs. 
Salt. 

Cut the steak in strips four inches 
thick; put it to stew in sufficient 
boiling water so it does not cover the 
meat. After cooking slowly half an 
hour, add the thyme, parsley, pepper, 
and onions, cut in thin slices. When 
seasoning is added, continue stewing 
until the meat is tender. Add corn- 
starch to make the gravy as thick as 
cream, also season with salt and 
sauce. Have ready the hard-boiled 
eggs, and place them in alternate 
layers with the meat in a pie dish; 
pour the gravy over all, cover with 
pastry, and bake. 

Beef Omelet. 

i pound raw beef, 

3 crackers, 



i teaspoonful baking powder, 
2 well-beaten eggs, 
i teaspoonful herbs. 

Chop the beef fine; roll in the 
cracker dust, with which has been 
mixed the baking powder. Add the 
eggs and mix with salt, pcj)per, and 
powdered herbs; put a lump of but- 
ter in a baking dish, let it melt, then 
put it in the mixture. Bake half an 
hour. Turn out on a hot platter, 
fold over as you would an omelet, 
and pour a meat sauce around it. 

Steak a la Victor Hugo (French 
recipe), 

1 porterhouse steak, 

i teaspoonful finely chopped 

shallot, 
1 tablespoonful tarragon vinegar, 
J cupful butter, 
Yolks 2 eggs, 
1 teaspoonful lemon juice, 
1 teaspoonful meat extract, 
^ teaspoonful horse-radish. 

Wipe a porterhouse steak, broil, 
and serve with Victor Hugo sauce 
made as follows: Cook shallot in 
vinegar five minutes. Wash J cupful 
butter and divide in thirds. Add 1 
piece butter to mixture with yolks of 
eggs, lemon juice, and meat extract. 
Cook over hot water, stirring con- 
stantly; as soon as the butter is 
melted, add second piece, then a third 
piece. When the mixture thickens, 
add horse-radish. The time for broil- 
ing the steak depends, of course, on 
how you like it; if it is wished rare, 
five minutes over a hot fire or under 
the flame of a gas stove will cook it 
sufficiently. When you wish the 
steak well done, give it from six to 
eight minutes. — Stella A, Downing. 

Steak Savory (Hungarian recipe),

lEFT-OVERS OF BEEF 

A roast of meat goes on the table 
in some households day after day in 
the same style, with the carver doing 
his best at each meal to leave it as 
sightly as possible. Its last appear- 
ance is calculated to take away the 
appetite of the entire family. The 
careful housewife, who aims, besides 
economy, to have a healthful, and 
attractive table, studies the cold 
roast on the second day with a keen 
eye. As a result of her planning, it 
comes from the refrigerator on a 
clean plate, and with it a bowl of 
brown gravy to which has been added 
every drop of the meat juices left in 
the platter on which the roast was 
served. 

Then for luncheon she plans cold 



128 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



meat, cut in neat slices from the 
clioicest bits of the roast, both rare 
slices and well done, to appeal to va- 
rious tastes. The meat is not cut un- 
til almost ready to put on the table. 
It is nicely arranged on a small plat- 
ter with a garnish of parsley, cress, 
or cubes of aspic. She does not re- 
heat the gravy to serve on cold plates. 
Worcestershire, tomato, or some cold 
homemade sauce makes a more fitting 
accompaniment. 

Finally she carves the roast and 
plans for future meals. The tough 
outside pieces are laid away to be 
chopped, the fat to be rendered down 
for drippings, the tender bits of meat 
to be deviled, used for pie, ragout, 
or warmed up in the gravy, while 
the bones and gristle go to the soup 
kettle. Not a morsel of the meat is 
wasted in such a kitchen, and the 
daintily served, appetizing meals that 
follow the roast at intervals do 
not hint to the uninitiated of re- 
chauffes. 

To make warmed-up meats appetiz- 
ing, there are various commodities 
which ought always to occupy a place 
in the pantry. Among these are a 
small jar of onion butter, a bottle of 
caramel, a glas can filled with 
browned flour, a jar of finely rolled 
bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, 
celery salt, mace, bay leaves, tabasco 
sauce, cayenne, curry, catsup, canned 
mushrooms, paprika, kitchen bouquet, 
and horse-radish. The secret of ap- 
petizing food is good flavoring, and 
the frequent varying of flavor has 
more to do with a tempting table 
than a large butcher bill. 

Meat Minced with Poached Eggs. 
2 cupfuls cold meat, 
1 cupful gravy or stock, 
Pepper, 
Salt, 
1 teaspoonful butter. 

Chop a pint of meat coarsely, sea- 
son well, licat in a cupful of left- 
over gravy or stock. Do not allow 
it to boil, merely to come to a sim- 
mer. Serve on diamonds of toast 
with a poached egg on top of each 
slice.

beef left from a pot roast, 

3 tablespoonfuls butter,

and saut^ them in a tablespoonful 
butter. Chop the cabbage and 2 ta- 
blespoonfuls butter in an omelet pan. 
Pepper and salt it, then stir over the 
fire till it begins to brown. Arrange 
on a hot platter as a border and into 
the middle put the hot meat. Serve 
with boiled potatoes. 

Grilled Slices with Creole Sauce. 

Cut from roast beef 6 slices of 
rarest meat, broil for five minutes 
over a clear fire, put on a hot plate, 
and serve with a sauce made as fol- 
lows: In a saucepan put 2 table- 
spoonfuls butter, 2 tablespoonfuls 
chopped onion, and 1 tablespoonful 
chopped green pepper. Fry light 
brown, stirring constantly. Add 2 
tablespoonfuls flour and stir to a 
paste; then put in a pint brown stock, 
2 teaspoonfuls Worcestershire sauce, 
a teaspoonful dry mustard, and 2 
teaspoonfuls vinegar. Salt and pep- 
per to taste. Cook over a slow fire, 
beating the sauce smooth. Add a 
teaspoonful chopped parsley and | 
can mushrooms cut in halves. Let 
the sauce come to a boil, then pour 
over the grilled meat. 

Deviled Beef. 

Take slices of rare roast beef and 
spread with butter on each side, as if 
you were buttering bread. Over this 
scrape a mustard made by mixing a 
tablespoonful vinegar with 3 table- 
spoonfuls mustard and a dash salt 
and pepper. Lay on a snioking-hot 
iron spider and fry till the slices be- 
gin to curl over. 

Mock Terrapin.

Put the butter and flour in a sauce- 
pan, and when blended, pour in the 
soup, and beat till smooth. Let it 
come to the boil, then add the meat 
cut in inch pieces, and draw to a 
cooler place on the stove where it can 
simmer half an hour. If you cannot 
watch it, pour it in a double boiler, 
for the success of this dish depends 
on the steeping of the meat at just 
below boiling point. Season with 
salt, pepper, and the cider when the 
dish is ready to take from the fire. 
Boil 6 eggs hard and lay in cold wa- 
ter to make the shells come off easily.

bage may be put into hot spiced vine- 
gar, served cold with vinegar, or 
heated with a little butter and pep- 
per, salt, if needed, and just a sus- 
picion of vinegar. Cut it fine, and 
heat thoroughly. Beets make good 
pickles. Turnips, carrots, and pars- 
nips can be warmed up. A favorite 
dish with many people is " red-flannel 
hash," plain hash containing a little 
chopped beet. Look over the meat, 
cutting out all the gristle and soft 
fat. Chop it fine with some of the 



hard fat. Mince potatoes which have 
been boiled in pot liquor. Use three 
times as much potatoes as meat.

meat niay escape. Brush egg over 
the outside, and fry like doughnuts 
in deep lard. They will take eight 
minutes to brown. Drain on thick 
paper, and serve hot in a folded 
napkin.

of Oklahoma, and from experience 
I know just how delicious it is. — Mrs. 
Thomas P. Gore.

move from skillet, place in a deep 
pan or kettle which has cover to fit. 
Half cover with cream or very rich 
milk and place in a very slow oven 
for three-quarters of an hour. 

Equally good for pork chops. The 
meat will be much more tender when 
prepared in this way. — Mrs. J. Clif- 
ford Theo. 

Corned Fillet of Veal. 

Take a large fillet of veal and make 
deep incisions or cuts all over it with 
sharp knife and insert a slip of the 
fat into each, pressing it down well 
to keep it in. Mix a tablespoonful 
of powdered saltpeter with half a 
pound of fine salt, and rub the meat 
all over with it. Make a brine of 
salt and water strong enough to swim 
an egg on its surface, adding a lump 
of saltpeter about the size of a wal- 
nut. Put the veal into the brine (of 
which there must be enough to more 
than cover it) and let it remain ten 
days, turning it every day, then take 
it out, wash ofi' the brine and boil 
the veal till thoroughly done and ten- 
der all through. It is best to eat it 
cold and sliced thin. 

VEAL LEFT-OVERS 

Veal is the flesh of an immature 
creature, and will not keep fresh as 
long as that of an older animal. A 
left-over of beef may be kept a day 
or two before serving again; it is bet- 
ter to see to the condition of veal 
twenty-four hours after cooking, es- 
pecially in hot weather, and serve it 
as soon as convenient. Veal has lit- 
tle flavor, and requires considerable 
seasoning. Brown sauce is the gen- 
eral accompaniment to veal at the 
first cooking. Save every spoonful 
of sauce to use with it when warming

over. If there is no brown gravy, 
white sauce may talie its place. Veal 
makes an excellent ragout, seasoned 
with onion juice and cayenne, minced 
and poured on toast for breakfast; 
in a salad or croquettes, it tastes very 
much like chicken. Add to it a few 
mushrooms or two or three spoonfuls 
left-over sweetbreads, and you have 
delicious rissoles. It is excellent com- 
bined with oysters in a scallop. When 
preparing it for a salad, be careful 
to reject all morsels of gristle as 
well as brown or hard meat. One- 
half measure each of cold veal and 
finely chopped white cabbage is de- 
licious with a horse-radish dressing. 
Marinate for two hours, else you will 
find the salad a tasteless one. 

Nut Balls. 

1 cupful cold chopped veal, 

12 chopped blanched almonds, 

i teaspoonful salt, 

1 egg. 

Pepper, 

Paprika, 

1 cupful tomato sauce. 

Mix the meat, almonds, and season- 
ing, and moisten with well-beaten 
egg. Roll into balls the size of a 
walnut and set in a baking pan. Pour 
over them the hot tomato sauce. 
Cook in a hot oven for twenty min- 
utes. Serve on a platter garnished 
with water cress. 

Windermere Croquettes (English 
recipe). 

1^ cupfuls milk, 

li tablespoonfuls butter, 

3 tablespoonfuls flour, 

1 teaspoonful salt.

2 cupfuls cold chopped veal, 

1 tablespoonful chopped parsley, 
i cupful cold rice, 
Yolks 3 hard-boiled eggs. 

Make a white sauce from the milk, 
flour, butter, and seasonings. To 1 
cupful sauce add the chopped meat 
and parsley. Spread on a plate to 
cool. Into the ^ cupful sauce beat the 
rice and the yolks of the eggs pushed 
through a potato ricer. Spread on a 



plate to cool. Take a tablespoonful 
meat mixture and flatten into a cake. 
Inside this put a teaspoonful rice 
mixture rolled in a tiny ball. Wrap 
the meat around it till covered. Koll 
in flour, egg, crumbs, and fry in deep 
fat. Pile cannon-ball fashion on a 
platter. Garnish with parsley. — Mary 
Kendall. 

Calf's Liver Terrapin with Mush- 
rooms. 

2 cupfuls cold liver, 

1 cupful stock, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 

3 eggs, 

i teaspoonful salt, 

1 teaspoonful paprika, 

i teaspoonful kitchen bouquet, 
i teaspoonful mustard, 

2 drops tabasco sauce, 

1 cupful mushrooms, 

2 truffles. 

Boil the eggs hard. Rub the yolks 
smooth with the butter, salt, paprika, 
kitchen bouquet, mustard, and ta- 
basco. Add the liver cut in small 
pieces and the stock. Cook five min- 
utes, add the mushrooms and truffles, 
and serve garnished with whites of 
eggs cut in rings. 

Veal Omelet. 

If you have a cupful of cold roast 
veal left over, chop it fine, season 
with pepper, salt, and a dash of pap- 
rika; then tuck it between the folds 
of an omelet. Pour over it before 
sending to the table a cup of hot, 
well-seasoned tomato sauce. 

Veal Roll. 

The remainder of a cold veal roast 
may be cut into 4 inch cubes and 
rolled in a crust prepared like baking 
J)Owder biscuit. Roll out dough on 
baking board, sprinkle chopped meat 
over, roll up like jelly roll and bake 
20 or 25 minutes. When baked cut 
crosswise like roll cake and serve hot.

■SAU- 



Roast Fork. 

Select a piece of loin from a young 
pig, 3 pounds in weight; score the 
rind across one-eighth of an inch 
apart, season with i tablespoonful 
salt and i teaspoonful pepper; lay 
the pork in a roasting pan, place it 
in a medium hot oven, roast till light 
brown, basting with its own gravy; 
then add i cupful boiling water; con- 
tinue to roast and baste till nearly 
done, turn the meat over, so the rind 
lies in the gravy, roast ten minutes, 
turn it again, so the rind is on the 
top; let it remain five minutes longer 
in the oven, transfer to a hot dish, 
free the gravy from fat, mix 1 tea- 
spoonful cornstarch with i cupful 
cold water, add it to the gravy, stir 
two minutes, add suflBcient boiling wa- 
ter to make creamy sauce, strain, and 
serve with the meat. 

Pork Tenderloins with Sweet Pota- 
toes. 

Wipe tenderloins, put in a dripping 
pan and brown quickly in a hot oven; 
then sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
and bake forty-five minutes, basting 
every fifteen minutes. 

Pare six potatoes and parboil ten 
minutes, drain, put in pan with meat, 
and cook until soft, basting when 
basting meat. — Fannie M. Farmer. 

Pork Chops, Sauce Robert. 

Take 8 rib chops, trim them neat- 
ly; have ready some finely chopped 
onion and parsley; sprinkle each 
chop on both sides with this, also salt 
and pepper, and beat lightly with a 
broad knife, to make all adhere. Dip 



each one into slightly beaten egg, 
then roll into fine bread crumbs; let 
stand five minutes; dip into melted 
butter, and roll again in the crumbs. 
Arrange in a Avire broiler and broil 
seven minutes over a clear fire. Chop 
fine 2 large onions, place in a stew- 
pan with 1 tablespoonful butter, and 
cook slowly until well colored; add 1 
tablespoonful flour, stir, and brown 
again, add slowly li cupfuls beef 
stock and 2 tablespoonfuls vinegar. 
When smooth and thick, simmer until 
reduced to 1 cupful, add 1 teaspoon- 
ful mixed mustard, salt, and pepper 
to taste. Pour this around the chops 
as they are dished. 

Bobble Gash (German recipe). 
1 pound lean pork, 
1 pound veal, 
1 tablespoonful lard, 
3 onions, 
5 potatoes, 
1 cupful cream, 
1 tablespoonful flour. 

Cut the pork and veal in small 
pieces. Put the lard in a kettle; 
when hot, add the onions sliced. As 
they commence to brown, drop in 
the meat and stir constantly until 
brown; then cover with water and 
boil three-fourths of an hour. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper. Pare and 
cut in small dice the potatoes; v.'hen 
boiled, add them to the meat with 
the cream. Thicken with flour. 

Boston Pork and Beans. 

Pick over and wash a quart of 
dried beans the night before you bake 
them. Put them to soak in cold wa- 



144 



PORK DISHES AND LEFT-OVERS 



145 



ter. In the morning, pour off the 
water, put them in a kettle, then cover 
with plenty of cold water, and set 
to boil. Cook till skin breaks on the 
beans when air blows over them, turn 
off the bean water; put them into 
a pot; score in lines the rind of a 
piece of pork and bury it, all but 
the surface of the rind, in the middle 
of the beans. Add enough boiling 
water to the beans to cover. Stir in 
two tablespoonfuls molasses and a 
teaspoonful each fresh mustard and 
salt. Cover the pot and put in the 
oven. Bake moderately, but steadily, 
five hours. If the water wastes away 
so as to be below the surface of the 
beans, supply enough just to cover 
them. Toward the end of the time, 
it may be allowed to dry down enough 
to permit the pork to brown. Un- 
cover the pot for a little while for 
this purpose. 

Hoast Fig. 

A pig for roasting should not 
weigh over 6 or 7 pounds after being 
cleaned. When it has been prepared 
by the butcher, lay it in cold water 
for fifteen minutes, then wipe dry, 
inside and out. Make a stuffing as 
for a turkey, adding two beaten eggs. 
Stuff the pig to his original size and 
shape. Sew him up, bend his fore 
legs backward, his back legs forward 
under him, and skewer into shape. 
Dredge with flour and set, with a 
little salt water, into a covered 
roaster. At the end of twenty min- 
utes remove the cover again, rub the 
pig with butter, and brown for ten 
minutes. Serve very hot with apple 
sauce. 

Homemade Sausage. 

Take of lean young pork IJ pounds 
tenderloin, the rest any lean cut, 
4 pounds, and fat, 2 pounds; put it 
through a sausage grinder — twice, 
perhaps three times, until of the de- 
sired fineness. Use for each pound 
of meat, 1 teaspoonful powdered 
dried leaf sage, 1 teaspoonful salt, J 
teaspoonful pepper, and J nutmeg; 
nutmeg may be omitted if preferred. 
A quantity of sausage may be made 
at a time and preserved for regular 



use if one has a cold storeroom in 
which to keep it. It should be packed 
in jars and covered an inch thick with 
melted lard, which will preserve it. 

Sauerkraut with Spareribs. 

Cover the kraut with cold water, 
add a little salt if necessary, and 
place to boil three hours before us- 
ing it. About an hour before it is 
done, put spareribs in and let them 
boil until the meat falls from the 
bones. Remove the spareribs, and 
stir in the kraut a grated raw po- 
tato from which the water has been 
drained. Let it come to a boil after 
this, being careful it does not burn; 
remove from the stove, and serve. 

To Boil a Ham. 

Twenty-four hours before a ham is 
to be used, scrub it thoroughly with 
a vegetable brush and cold, weak 
borax water. Put in cold water and 
soak twenty-four hours. If it is to 
be baked, it requires four hours' boil- 
ing. Use a big kettle, as the ham 
must be covered all over with water. 
Let it come to the boil very slowly. 
Remove the scum. When it begins 
to boil, add 12 whole cloves, 1 bay 
leaf, 12 peppercorns, the outside 
stalks of 1 bunch celery, 2 chopped 
onions, 2 cloves garlic, 1 chopped car- 
rot and turnip, 2 blades mace, 12 all- 
spice berries, and 1 quart cider or a 
cupful of vinegar. Never allow the 
ham to boil, merely simmer slowly; 
that is one secret of making it per- 
fectly tender. Allow twenty-five min- 
utes or half an hour to the pound. 
If the ham is to be used cold, you can 
add to its tender juiciness by allow- 
ing it to stand in the pot liquor till 
nearly cold. Then lift it out, peel off 
the skin and roll in dried bread 
crumbs with which 3 tablespoonfuls 
brown sugar have been sifted. Set it 
in the oven till the crumbs form a 
crisp brown crust. If the ham is to 
be baked, take it from the water, 
drain thoroughly, then take off the 
skin except around the shank, where 
it may be cut in Vandykes with 
a sharp-pointed knife. Cover with 
crumbs and stick it full of cloves, set 
in a moderate oven, and bake two 



146 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



hours. If you prefer the ham glazed, 
allow it to cool as for boiled ham, 
then skin, wipe dry, and brush all 
over with beaten egg. Mix 1 cupful 
sifted cracker crumbs, a dash salt and 
pepper, 2 tablespoonfuls melted but- 
ter, and cream enough to make 
crumbs into a paste. Spread it evenly 
over the ham, set in a moderate 
oven, and bake till brown; serve hot 
with brown sauce. When a baked or 
boiled ham goes to the table, wrap 
about the unsightly bone a ruffle of 
white tissue paper, and garnish with 
hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters. 

After boiling salt ham or tongue re- 
move it from the fire and plunge at 
once in cold water. This instantly 
loosens the skin, which then pulls off 
without any trouble. 

Ham Steak. 

Put slices of raw ham in a frying 
pan with i cupful water to make 
them tender. When the water has 
boiled out and the ham is light brown 
on both sides, dust with flour and 
pour on the following dressing, pre- 
viously made: A cupful milk and 
cream mixed, a little butter, a tea- 
spoonful mustard, and a dash tabasco 
sauce. As soon as it boils, serve. 

Ham may be kept from getting 
hard and dry on the outside thus: 
take some of the fat part of the ham 
and fry it out. Let it get hard, then 
spread on the cut end of the ham; 
half an inch thick is not too much. 
This excludes air. Hang in a cool 
place. When I want to slice ham I 
scrape off this fat, and afterwards 
put it on again as before. 

Broiled Ham and Eggs. 

Slice the ham thin, take off the 
rind, and soak the slices in hot water. 
Broil carefully and place on a hot 
platter. Break as many eggs as you 
require into a pan of boiling water; 
when the white is done, dip out care- 
fully and lay the egg on ham. 
Sprinkle pepper and salt over each 
egg and serve. 

Sausage EoUs. 

Make a dough as for baking pow- 
der biscuit; roll out and cut in large 



rounds with a biscuit cutter; lay 
sausage meat on half of each piece; 
turn the other half over and pinch to- 
gether; bake half an hour. Serve 
with brown sauce poured around it. 

Toad in the Hole (English recipe). 
1 cupful flour, 
1 egg, 

1 cupful milk, 
Salt and pepper, 

1 teaspoonful baking powder, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 
Sausages. 

Put the flour in a basin with the 
salt and make a well in the center. 
Break the egg and put it in with a 
quarter of the milk. Beat well, then 
add the remainder of the milk by de- 
grees, beating all the time. Melt the 
butter in a pudding tin. Parboil the 
sausages, cut them in halves, and put 
them in the tin. Add the baking 
powder to the batter, and pour it 
over the sausages. Bake in a hot 
oven half an hour. 

Sausage and Apple. 

Prick the skins of the sausages, 
simmer in a frying pan fifteen min- 
utes, drain, and brown in the oven; 
make a sirup of 1 cupful each sugar 
and water, and in it cook pared ap- 
ples, cut lattice fashion, a few at a 
time, to preserve the shape. Serve 
the sausage on the apple. 

Broiled Pigs' Feet. 

Scrape the feet and wash them 
thoroughly, soak in cold water two 
hours, then wash and scrape again. 
Split each in half lengthwise, and 
tie the pieces separately in pieces of 
cheese cloth. Place in a deep sauce- 
pan, cover with boiling water, add 
1 tablespoonful salt, and simmer 
slowly until the feet are tender, usu- 
ally about four hours. Take them 
from the liquor and set aside until 
cold; remove the cloths; they are 
ready then to be broiled in the follow- 
ing: 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 

1 tablespoonful lemon juice, 

i teaspoonful salt. 



PORK DISHES AND LEFT-OVERS 



147 



Dash tabasco sauce, 
i tablespoonful finely chopped 
parsley. 

Cream the butter. Work gradually 
into it lemon juice, salt, tabasco, and 
parsley. After removing the cloth 
from each piece, brush with melted 
butter and dust with salt and pepper. 
Broil over a clear fire for six min- 
utes. Transfer to a hot platter, and 
spread with prepared butter. The 
pigs' feet may be prepared the day 
before needed. 

Fried Salt Pork, Cream Gravy. 
i pound salt pork, 
1 cupful cream, 
1 teaspoonful flour. 
Pinch pepper. 

Wash the pork, trim off the rind, 
and with a sharp knife cut in thin 
slices. Spread in a large spider and 
place at the side of the fire until the 
fat is well fried out, then draw gradu- 
ally forward imtil the slices begin to 
color. Transfer them to a heated 
platter and keep hot. Pour off most 
of the fat, leaving about 2 table- 
spoonfuls in the pan; stir into this 
the flour, and when it is smooth add 
cream and let cook until thickened. 
Season with pepper; boil up once, and 
pour over the pork. 

Delicious Fork Roast. 

Take a piece of tenderloin, about 
two pounds. Sear this on all sides. 
Put salt and pepper on and enough 
hot water to avoid burning. When 
half finished, add about i cupful 
vinegar. In the meantime always 
continue adding water, so that the 
meat will not become dry. Slice two 
large onions, and crumble up four 
gingersnaps, or any strongly spiced 
cookies; add to the roast when almost 
tender. The whole time of baking is 
three or four hours, according to the 
size of the roast. — Mrs. K. A. Krotke. 

PORK AND HAM LEFT-OVERS 

Roast pork, in the estimation of 
some persons, is better cold than hot. 
Serve it thus in neatly cut slices 
for tea or luncheon at the second 



meal, then take stock of the remains 
and look to the future. Roast pork 
bones make an excellent brown stock, 
almost as rich as that of roast beef. 
Trim the scraps from the bones and 
consign them to the soup kettle. Cut 
with a keen knife all the fat from the 
meat that is not to be served cold. 
This fat rendered down makes an ex- 
cellent dripping to saut6 potatoes. 
Chop, and allow it to melt, strain and 
set away in the refrigerator. 

The tender white meat of pork 
makes a salad which tastes very much 
like chicken. Sometimes if one has a 
few bits of chicken left over, they 
may be combined with the pork, cut 
in neat cubes, and the substitution 
can scarcely be detected. Pork also 
makes excellent croquettes and is 
good sliced and reheated in a cup of 
its brown gravy. It may be minced, 
enriched by a few spoonfuls of 
gravy, and poured on toast for a 
breakfast dish. Cold ham has a mul- 
titude of uses. A few scraps may 
be converted into a delicious sand- 
wich or it may be used to give an 
excellent flavor to a salad omelet or 
egg dish. Even cold sausage has its 
uses, while a slice or two of cold 
broiled bacon put through a meat 
chopper and added to croquette mix- 
tures provides an agreeable seasoning. 

Ham Souffle. 

Take 2 cupfuls cold minced ham, 
add the white of 1 egg and beat till 
smooth. Then put in a dash of pap- 
rika, 1 cupful whipped cream, and 2 
whites of eggs beaten stiff. Pour into 
an oiled melon mold, bake and serve

TURKEY — CHICKEN FRICASSEE — ROAST DUCK, SQUAB, ETC. 
— RABBITS — FROGS' LEGS — SPECIAL POULTRY DISHES AND 
LEFT-OVERS 



In selecting a chicken, feel of the 
breastbone; it ought to be smooth and 
soft as cartilage and bend easily. A 
young chicken has soft feet, a smooth 
skin, and an abundance of pin- 
feathers. Long hairs, coarse scales 
on the feet, and an ossified breast- 
bone are pretty sure signs of an old 
fowl. By the same marks you may 
choose a tender, young turkey or 
duck. 

To dress and clean poultry, hold 
the bird over a flame, either of alco- 
hol, gas, or burning paper, and blaze 
off all the hair and down. Cut 
off the head and pick out the pin- 
feathers with a fine-pointed knife. 
In case of an old fowl or turkey it is 
worth while to pull the tendons. 
This operation makes the dark meat 
so much more tender. Find the por- 
tion just behind the leg joint where 
there are a bunch of tendons, and 
with fine-pointed scissors, cut very 
carefully the cartilage skin that cov- 
ers them, and strip it down till you 
leave exposed the bunch of white 
sinews. If the bird is fairly tender, 
they can be pulled by inserting a 
stout steel skewer, lifting each ten- 
don by itself and twisting it until it 
snaps. A turkey will frequently re- 
quire something as strong as a screw- 
driver. 

To admit the hand, make an in- 
cision through the skin just below the 
breastbone and remove the gizzard. 



150 



heart, etc.; be very careful not to 
break the gall bladder, as even a drop 
of its contents would give a bitter 
flavor to everything it touches. Be 
careful also to remove the kidneys 
which lie close to the backbone in the 
two hollows near the tail piece. Pull 
out the lungs — they lie inside the 
ribs — also the kidneys, crop, and 
windpipe. Draw the neck skin down 
and cut the neck off close to the body, 
leaving skin enough to cover the open- 
ing. Cut out the oil bag in the tail. 
Finally wash the fowl by allowing 
cold water to run through it. 

If a chicken is to be cut up, sever 
the skin between the leg and body, 
bend the leg back, and cut through 
the flesh. Separate the second joint 
from the drumstick, take off the 
limbs and cut the breast away from 
the back, starting just below the 
breastbone and letting the knife pass 
between the small ribs on either side 
through to the collar bone. 

When trussing a fowl for roasting 
or boiling, draw the legs close to the 
body and insert a skewer under the 
middle joint, running it straight 
through until it comes out opposite. 
Cross the drumsticks, tie them with 
a long string together and fasten to 
the tail. Put the wings close to the 
body and keep them in place by a 
second skewer. Draw the skin of 
the neck under the back and pin 
down with a toothpick. Now turn

the bird on its breast, take the string 
attached to the tail and tie to the 
lower skewer, cross it, draw through 
the upper skewer, and cut off the 
ends. 

Braised Chicken. 

Truss a plump chicken, fry in the 
fat of salt pork, place on a trivet in a 
deep pan; into the fat put a carrot 
cut in squares, i onion, i bay leaf, 
and a sprig of parsley. Add 2 ta- 
blespoonfuls butter and allow the 
vegetables to fry delicately brown. 
Pour this over the chicken. Add 3 
cupfuls hot chicken broth, cover, and 
set in a moderate oven. Baste fre- 
quently, adding water to the stock, 
if necessary. Lift the chicken to a 
hot platter, skim off the fat, thicken 
the gravy and season, then strain 
over the fowl. 

Broiled Chicken. 

Sprinkle a chicken, which has been 
cut up, with salt and pepper, dip 
into melted butter, then place in a 
broiler. Cook twenty minutes over a 
bright fire, turning the broiler so the 
pieces may be equally brown. Put 
on a platter spread with soft butter, 
sprinkle with pepper and salt, and 
set in the oven for a few minutes be- 
fore serving. 

Grilled Chicken. 

Choose small chickens, split down 
the back, and soak each in olive oil, 
seasoned with salt and pepper, for an 
hour or two. Coat with flour, and 
broil over a clear fire till done. Into 
a saucepan put 1 cupful water and 
an onion; let cook fifteen minutes, 
take out the onion, and pour the 
sauce over thin slices of toast, on 
which arrange the chickens. Garnish 
with fried parsley. 

Chicken with Dumplings (New Eng- 
land recipe). 

3 or 4 pound chicken, 
1 tablespoonful salt, 

1 teaspoonful pepper, 

2 onions, 

1 tablespoonful flour, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 



J cupful milk, 

2 cupfuls prepared flour. 

Cut chicken in 10 pieces and place 
in saucepan. Add salt, pepper, and 
onion, cover with boilfng water, and 
cook till tender; then mix flour with 
butter, and thicken the gravy. Ten 
minutes before serving, mix pre- 
pared flour with butter and milk, and 
2 eggs beaten to a stiff froth; cut 
with a tablespoon small portions 
from the dough, drop them into the 
gravy, cover, and boil six minutes; 
remove the saucepan to side of stove, 
where they may stop boiling. In 
serving, arrange the chicken on a 
platter, and lay the dumplings in a 
circle around it. Sprinkle 1 table- 
spoonful chopped parsley over the 
whole, and serve. This dough will 
make 12 dumplings. 

Chicken Baked in Milk. 

Prepare a chicken as though for 
roasting. Mix a dressing — using 
crumbed bread, butter, salt, and pep- 
per. Stuff the chicken with this mix- 
ture; place it in a baker. In the 
bottom of the pan put 2 quarts rich 
milk; cover, and bake slowly, until 
the chicken is very tender, turning 
and basting as often as necessary. 
Thicken the gravy in the pan, season- 
ing with salt and pepper. 

Chicken in Casserole. 
2|-pound chicken, 
1 can mushrooms, 
1 carrot, 
1 onion, 
1 stalk celery, 

1 tablespoonful chopped parsley, 
1 teaspoonful salt, 
i teaspoonful pepper, 
1 teaspoonful beef extract, 

1 tablespoonful flour, 

2 cupfuls boiling water. 

Clean and truss the chicken, and 
steam until tender. Melt the butter 
in a frying pan, add the vegetables 
chopped fine, cook five minutes, then 
add the flour. Dissolve the beef ex- 
tract in boiling water, add the sea- 
sonings, and pour it into the frying 
pan. Cook five minutes. Put the 
chicken in a casserole, dredge with 



152 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



flour, dust with salt and pepper, and 
pour the contents of the frying pan 
over it. Place it in the oven, and 
cook until the chicken is thoroughly 
browned. Remove from the oven, 
cover, and serve in the casserole. 

Panned Chicken. 

Prepare a chicken as for broiling, 
slightly flatten it, cover with bits of 
butter, and place in a moderate oven. 
When nearly done, sprinkle with salt 
and pepper and dredge with flour; 
return to the oven and brown, first 
on one side, then on the other. Keep 
hot while you make the sauce. Pour 
a cupful hot milk into the pan, and 
add 1 tablespoonful grated bread 
crumbs, also a few drops onion juice. 
Stir the sauce vigorously, let it 
boil one minute, turn over the 
chicken, garnish with parsley, and 
serve. 

Tried Chicken (Southern recipe). 

Cut a young chicken into neat 
pieces, drop in cold water, then roll 
in flour seasoned with salt and pep- 
per. Put it in a saucepan with fat 
which has been fried out of salt pork, 
and cook, turning once or twice till 
it is well browned. Skim ofl" as much 
of the fat as possible, add a cupful 
cream or rich milk, thicken with a 
little flour, seasoning if necessary, 
and strain over the chicken. 

Chicken with Almond Sauce (South- 
ern recipe). 

1 young chicken, 
1 tablespoonful lard, 

1 tablespoonful flour, 

2 cupfuls cream, 

1 tablespoonful finely chopped 
parsley, 

1 cupful chopped blanched al- 
monds. 

Cut up the chicken as for fricas- 
see; fry golden brown in hot lard. 
Put it on a hot platter and make the 
sauce. Thicken the lard (in which 
the chicken was fried) with the flour; 
when the flour is cooked, add the 
cream, parsley, and almonds. Let it 
boil five minutes, and pour around 
the chicken. 



Chicken with Peanuts (Spanish rec- 
ipe). 

Cut a young chicken into small 
pieces, roll in flour, and fry brown in 
lard or butter. W'lien the chicken is 
done, pour over it a cupful sweet 
cream and sprinkle liberally with 
roasted peanuts coarsely powdered. 

Creamed Chicken and Sweetbreads. 
4-pound chicken, 
4 sweetbreads, 
1 can mushrooms, 
1 quart cream, 

4 tablespoonfuls butter, 

5 tablespoonfuls flour, 
i grated onion, 
Nutmeg, salt, and pepper. 

Boil chicken and sweetbreads; 
when cold, cut them up. In a sauce- 
pan put cream; in another butter and 
flour. Stir until melted, then pour 
on the hot cream, stirring until it 
thickens; add onion and nutmeg, and 
season highly with pepper and salt. 
Put chicken and other ingredients, 
with sweetbreads and mushrooms, in 
a baking dish, cover with bread 
crumbs and butter, then bake twenty 
minutes. 

Chicken Pie. 

Stew a cut-up chicken in enough 
boiling water to cover, adding pep- 
per and salt. ^VTien parboiled, re- 
move to a deep earthen dish and 
cover with a crust. Use a recipe for 
rich baking-powder biscuit. Instead 
of putting a blanket of the dough on 
top of the pie, cut it into rounds, as 
for biscuit. Have the chicken laid 
lightly so the gravy will not touch 
the dough, and cover as closely as 
possible. Bake in a moderate oven 
until the crust is well risen and 
brown. This is an improvement on 
the old style of all-over crust, partly 
because it allows plenty of escape for 
steam. The biscuit can be easily 
served, and the paste is not made 
heavy by cutting with a knife. 

Roast Turkey. 

Remove the crusts from a stale loaf 
of bread. Break the loaf in the mid- 
dle and grate or rub the bread into 



POULTRY AND GAME DISHES 



153 



fine crumbs. Season highly with salt 
and pepper. Add a cup of diced 
celery, cooked tender. With a fork 
mix celery and seasoning through the 
crumbs, then sprinkle with them 3 
or 4 tablespoonfuls melted butter. 
With a spoon put the prepared 
crumbs in the place from which the 
crop was removed until the breast be- 
comes plump. Put the remaining 
crumbs in the body. Do not pack 
the crumbs closely either in crop or 
body, but allow room for them to 
swell when moistened by the steam 
from the turkey in cooking. Fold 
back the wings. Press the legs close 
to the body, crossing the drumsticks 
in front of the tail. With small 
skewers and strong cord fasten in 
proper shape. Place the turkey, back 
up, on a rack in the roasting pan. 
When the back is browned, turn the 
turkey over, and when the breast and 
sides are nicely browned, baste with 
a thin gravy every ten or fifteen min- 
utes until the fowl is cooked. An 8- 
pound turkey will cook in two hours. 
Use the water in which the celery 
was cooked to make basting gravy 
for the turkey. — Emma P. Ewing. 

Roast Chicken. 

4-pound chicken, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 

1 tablespoonful butter, 

1 tablespoonful cornstarch, 

i cupful boiling water. 

Singe the chicken, wash it quickly 
in cold water, then dry with a towel; 
season inside and out with salt, fill 
the body and crop with bread dress- 
ing, sew it up, and spread butter over 
the breast. Cover the breast with 
thin slices of larding pork; bend the 
wings backward, put skewers through 
the thigh and body, and place it in 
a roasting pan. Set the pan in a 
medium-hot oven and roast until the 
chicken has become a fine brown all 
over, basting frequently with its own 
gravy; then add i cupful boiling 
water; continue the roasting and 
basting till the chicken is done, which 
will take from one to two hours, ac- 
cording to the age of the fowl. If 
the gravy gets too brown, add a lit- 



tle more water. The chicken feet, 
neck, and giblets may be used to 
make rice soup. Shortly before serv- 
ing, lay the chicken on a dish, remove 
the skewers and thread, free the 
gravy from fat, mix the cornstarch 
with cold water, add it to the gravy, 
stir, and cook for a few minutes; 
then add suflBcient boiling water to 
make a creamy sauce. Cook three 
minutes, strain, chop the boiled gib- 
lets fine and add to the sauce. 

Chicken Fricassee. 

Cut a fowl up into pieces, sift 
with flour to which a little salt and 
pepper has been added, then saut6 
slowly in pork fat, put in a saucepan 
covered with boiling water and cook 
very slowly till tender. When half 
done, season with salt and pepper. 
Arrange the chicken in pieces upon 
toast, or if liked better, fix New 
England style, with a circle of bak- 
ing powder biscuits about them 
heaped on a platter. In arranging 
the chicken, lay it on the platter as 
much as possible in the shape of a 
whole bird, having the breast in the 
center, legs and wings in the natural 
position and back underneath; this 
makes it easy to serve. To the liquor 
from the chicken add a cup of cream 
or three tablespoonfuls of butter and 
thicken with a quarter of a cup of 
flour dissolved in cold water. Strain 
over the chicken and biscuits. If 
there is more gravy than the plat- 
ter will hold serve it in a gravy boat. 

Bread Dressing. 

^ pound stale bread, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 

2 tablespoonfuls chopped onion, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 

i teaspoonful pepper, 

1 teaspoonful thyme, 

1 egg. 

Soak bread in cold water, place a 
saucepan with butter and onions over 
the fire; cook five minutes without 
browning; inclose the bread in a towel 
and press out all the water, add it 
to the saucepan, stir over the fire five 
minutes, then remove; when cold, add 
salt, pepper, thyme, and egg; mix 
well and use as stuffing.

Eoast Duck. 

Pick, singe, and wipe outside of 
duck. Salt and pepper the inside 
after carefully drawing and wiping. 
Cut off the wings at the second point 
and truss the duck neatly. Roast in 
a very hot oven from one and a half 
to tw'O hours in a baking pan con- 
taining a little water; baste fre- 
quently. Celery, onions, or apples, 
cored and quartered, are sometimes 
placed inside the duck to improve the 
flavor. 

Broiled Squab. 

Cut the squab down back, flatten 
and truss it as a fowl for broiling. 
Egg it on both sides, season with pep- 
per and salt, dip it in chopped bread

egg, roll in cracker crumbs or corn 
meal, and fry in hot butter. — Mrs. 
William E. Hitchcock. 

LEFT-OVER POULTRY 

Chicken, even at twenty cents a 
pound, is not more extravagant than 
roast beef, when one considers that 
every morsel of it can be used, even 
to the bleaching of the bones in a 
soup. The carcasses of two good 
chickens or one turkey will make a 
quart or two of excellent stock pro- 
vided, of course, that every bone, the 
giblets, and every morsel of skin is 
saved. A careful housewife gathers 
all these remains into a clean bowl 
and lets them stand in the refrigera- 
tor until ready to be used. Cover 
them with cold water, add the sea- 
sonings suitable for chicken soup, and 
set far back on the stove, where it 
will take at least an hour to begin to 
simmer. In four hours it will be 
ready to strain. Never add salt to a 
soup till after it has cooked. Cool 
the stock as quickly as possible, but 
never by putting it steaming hot into 
the refrigerator. I have seen that 
plan followed in more than one 
household; then I have heard the cook 
exclaim in wonder over spoiled stock 
and other foods ruined. Still, the 
sooner stock cools, the longer it will 
keep. Do not break the cake of fat 
on top until ready to use; it excludes 
the air and helps keep the soup sweet. 

There is no meat so suitable for 
r4chauff4s as chicken. It makes ex-

cellent croquettes and tirabales. 
Creamed, it loses none of its delicate 
flavor. It is excellent in pat^s or on 
toast. It is good scalloped, deviled, 
curried, in fritters, or as souffle, while 
on hot summer days it appeals to the 
appetite as a salad, in aspic jelly, in 
a mousse, or potted. Tlie meat of 
turkey, game, duck, and goose may 
be treated in many instances as 
chicken. The flavor of a turkey 
salad is not as delicate as a chicken 
salad, still it is a dish not to be 
despised. The same rule ought to 
apply to the warming over of poul- 
try as to other meats. Do not cook 
it a second time; all it requires is 
reheating. 

Scalloped Turkey. 

Into small ramequin dishes sprinkle 
dried bread crumbs browned in but- 
ter. Over this put a layer, one and 
a half inches deep, of chopped, cold 
turkey moistened by a spoonful of

CHOOSING FISH 

I can think of no better lesson on 
how to choose fish than this: if it is 
possible in j'our neighborhood, or 
while vacationing, go to see a fish 
boat empty its gleaming cargo on the 
wharf. Learn to know the earmarks, 
the signs of perfect freshness on all 
fish. Do not be afraid of touching 
them; and every fish has a wholesome 
smell. Turn them over, examine them 
closelj\ " An eye like a dead fish " 
refers to a fish which has lain for 
weeks in cold storage, not to one just 
from the water. The latter will have 
eyes as full and almost as clear as 
those of a live creature. Notice the 
gills; they will be beautifully red, 
the fins will be stiff, the scales shin- 
ing, and the flesh so firm that it will 
spring back after the finger has been 
pressed into it. 

One cannot expect, — especially if 
one's home is at some distance from 
the ocean or the great lakes — to find 
in the market fish as superlatively 
fresh as when lifted straight from the 
net. Still, to be fit for human food, 
they should not have lost much of 
their beauty. The signs to avoid are 
limp fins, dull eyes, pale, liver-col- 
ored gills, flesh in which you leave a 
dent by an impression of the finger, 
streaks of gray or yellow in the skin 
and flesh, or the sliglitcst symptom 
of a disagreeable odor. If you have 



to make the choice between salt cod 
and a fish of this description, choose 
salt cod; it is infinitely more health- 
ful for it does not contain a possi- 
bility of ptomaine poisoning. 

When purchasing halibut or sword- 
fish, if the head and fins have been 
removed, the test is pearly white or 
shining gray skin, firm flesh, and a 
good odor. It is an excellent rule 
never to buy fish which is out of sea- 
son. If you want bluefish in Febru- 
ary or shad in November, you can 
probably obtain it — a fish dealer will 
produce almost anything from his re- 
frigerator at any time of the year — 
but you may rest assured it has seen 
a repose of months in cold storage. 
If not really dangerous to eat, it will 
be flabby, it will go to pieces before 
it is cooked, and be lacking in flavor. 
It is an excellent plan to post oneself 
thoroughly on the fish which is in sea- 
son all the year round and purchase 
according to the month. A dealer 
will assure one that fish which has 
been packed in ice ten days is in as 
excellent condition as when fresh 
caught. I should say seven or eight 
days is the limit. 

Although the old theory that fish 
is brain food has been exploded, the 
brain worker will find what he most 
requires in a bountiful diet of fish. 
It is digestible food, which is not 
overstimulating or overnutritivc. But 
salmon, mackerel, and eels, which are 



158 



FISH DISHES AND LEFT-OVERS 



159 



exceedingly oily, are an exception to 
the digestible rule. 

It is no economy to be inveigled 
into buying a 5-pound bluefish when 
2 pounds of halibut would have fed 
your family. Fish left over can be 
utilized nicely in many ways, but, in 
summer, cold fish has not remarkable 
keeping qualities. Decide when you 
order a fish how you will cook it. 
For should you so desire, the fish 
dealer can prepare it for planking or 
broiling better than you can. The 
cheapest fish is not always the most 
economical. Five pounds of cod con- 
tains about 2 pounds of waste in 
the shape of skin, head, tail, and 
bone, while 3 pounds of halibut is 
solid fish with scarcely an ounce of 
waste. 

COOKING FISH 

The cooking of fish depends large- 
ly on taste, for various methods ap- 
ply frequently and most appetizingly 
to the same fish. Take halibut, for 
instance. It may be baked, broiled, 
fried or boiled, and be quite as de- 
licious in one way as another. This 
rule is also true of cod, haddock, and 
nearly every kind of white-fleshed 
fish. What a cook or a fish dealer 
calls oily fish — this class contains 
bluefish, mackerel, herring, salmon, 
eels, and shad — are best suited for 
broiling, baking, or planking. They 
contain so much oil distributed 
through the flesh that it requires a 
dry intense heat to make them pal- 
atable. Salmon is an exception to 
tiiis rule, being at its best when 
boiled. 

The fish which plank to perfection 
are shad, whitefish, mackerel, blue- 
fish, red snapper, and pompano. 
There are a number of real advan- 
tages to this method of cooking; it 
is very easy, it may be done in the hot 
oven of any coal or gas stove and the 
wood imparts a flavor to the fish 
which can be obtained in no other 
way. Then there is no difficult task 
of sliding it from a broiler or bake 
pan to the platter, because it is the 
proper thing to send the plank direct 
to the table laid on a tray or serving 



platter. If you have to prepare a fish 
for planking, remember it must be 
cut down the back instead of the 
stomach, the thin portion of the flesh 
being folded on the middle of the 
plank. 

Improvise a fish kettle if you 
haven't one. Line a wire basket with 
a towel, allowing the linen to fall over 
the edges, put in the fish, coiling it 
slightly if it is large, and drop the 
basket in a kettle of boiling water. 
This is an easier method for lifting 
it out whole than if set directly in 
the kettle. 

An oily fish, such as mackerel or 
bluefish, needs no enrichment of fat 
before broiling; a white-fleshed fish 
does. If the latter is cut in steaks, 
dip it in oil or melted butter, add a 
good seasoning of pepper and salt, 
and put between the wires of the 
broiler. Lay the thickest end in the 
center of the broiler over the hottest 
part of the fire, skin side up. Let 
it get perfectly crisp and brown on 
the flesh side before turning. Broil 
the skin side carefully; it is apt to 
burn. Set it in a hot oven for five 
minutes thoroughly to finish cooking. 

Fish of all sorts require the ac- 
companiment of a starch food — as 
bread, rice, potatoes, or macaroni — 
to make a well-balanced meal. 

An iron fish sheet, with rings at 
each end for handles, may be made 
by any tinsmith for twenty-five cents. 
Grease it well before setting the fish 
to cook and lay under it strips of 
salt pork, then set in a baking pan. 
You will find it easy to slip a baked 
fish from this sheet onto a platter. 

When baking halibut, pour milk 
over and around it before setting it in 
the oven. It keeps the fish moist, im- 
proves the flavor, and makes it brown 
more thoroughly. 

In spite of careful watching, a fish 
will occasionally break in the boil- 
ing. Do not try to patch it together 
into an unsightly heap of skin, bones, 
and meat. Flake it quickly and lay 
in good-sized portions on a large 
platter. Garnish with roses of mashed 
potatoes squeezed from a pastry 
bag, and over the fish pour a sauce. 
This transforms an almost hopeless

finish cooking. Cools about twenty- 
five minutes, basting often. Set the 
planit upon a platter. Spread over 
the fish 3 tablespoonfuls butter, 
creamed and mixed with salt, pepper, 
and a tablespoonful lemon juice and 
chopped i^arsley. Garnish the edge of 
the plank with potato mashed, sea- 
soned and made soft enough with but- 
ter and milk to put through a })astry 
tube. Return to the oven to brown 
the potato. Garnish with slices of to- 
mato, cucumber and lemon and sjirigs 
of parsley. 

How to Saute Fish. 

Fish may be fried in oil, salt pork 
fat, lard, or clarified drippings. Have 
fat hot and use as little as possible 
to cook fish and keep from sticking 
to the pan. Pork fat is obtained by 
trying out thin slices of fat salt pork, 
being careful not to let it burn. Pork 
gives the fish a flavor not to be ob- 
tained by any other oil or fat. 
When pork fat is used, salt should 
be added but sparingly. Fried fish 
should be seasoned while cooking. 
After wiping dry, fish should be rolled 
in Indian meal, flour, or sifted 
crumbs before frying. If the fish has 
been on ice, or is very cold, do not 
put it in the fat fast enough to cool 
it perceptibly. Watch carefully while 
cooking; don't break or mutilate the 
fish in turning; cook brown, drain on 
a sieve, colander, or paper, and serve 
hot on a napkin. Unless fish are very 
small, they should be notched on each 
side before rolling in meal previous 
to frying. 

How to Broil Fish. 

Broiling is probably the simplest as 
well as the best method of cooking 
many kinds of fish, the flavor and 
juices being better preserved. Salt 
pork is the best thing to use. The 
double broiler is the best utensil, 
though they may be cooked on a grid- 
dle or a spider. Heat and grease 
well before laying in the fish, the 
flesh side first; when that is perfectly 
browned, turn and finish cooking. 
Serve on a hot platter, spread with 
butter or cream or both, and season 
to taste. Or a fish may be broiled 



in a dripping pan, and if the oven is 
hot will cook nicely. Baste once or 
twice with butter or cream while 
cooking. 

How to Boil Fish. 

Boiling is the most insipid way of 
cooking fish, yet there are certain va- 
rieties that are better cooked this way 
if accompanied by a rich sauce. Fish, 
if boiled in a common kettle, should 
first be wrapped in cheese cloth, to 
preserve its shape. Boiled fish should 
be served with a sauce. A fish of 6 
pounds should boil or steam in thirty 
or thirty-five minutes. The water 
should always be salted. A boiled 
fish may be stuflfed if desired. 

How to Bake Fish. 

A baked fish presents a more at- 
tractive appearance when served in 
an upright position on the platter; it 
also cooks better. To keep it up- 
right, press it down enough to flatten 
the under side, then, if necessary, 
brace with skewers or potatoes placed 
against it until it is well under way 
for cooking, then it will keep its posi- 
tion until cooked and dished. Some- 
times it is advisable to bend the fish 
half-moon shape and cook it that 
way, or if the fish is long and slender, 
the tail may be tied to the mouth, 
either of which methods will keep 
the fish in upright position. Lay over 
the back and in the pan small strips 
of salt pork, add 1 cupful hot water 
and baste often while baking. 

How to Fry Fish. 

Small fish may be broiled, but in 
nearly every case they are better 
sautM or fried. There are tiny fish, 
which cannot be treated in any other 
way. Lard may be used as a frying 
material, though a mixture of suet 
and lard is better; but best of all, if 
it can be afi"orded, is a clear frying 
oil, which leaves no greasy taste. To 
prepare a fish, such as perch, brook 
trout, catfish, smelts, or tiny mack- 
erel, for frying, wash in cold water, 
clean thoroughly, and wipe dry inside 
and out. Small fish must be gently 
handled; they are tender and the flesh 
bruises easily. Roll them in flour, 



162 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



then in beaten egg, to which a table- 
spoonful of cold water has been add- 
ed, and roll again in finely sifted 
bread crumbs. Have the oil hot 
enough to brown a cul)e of bread in 
60 seconds, put a few fish at a time 
into the frying basket, and cook five 
or seven minutes. Do not allow them 
to get dark brown. Drop on absorb- 
ent paper and drain off as much of 
the fat as possible. Lay on a folded 
napkin on a hot platter, and garnish 
with parsley and points of lemon. 
M'hen smelts are very tiny, run a 
skewer through the heads of three or 
four of them and fry in bunches. 
Fish which is sliced, then cut in fillets, 
can be cooked in the same fashion. 
The easiest way to prepare it is to 
roll each fillet and fasten with a 
toothpick. 

Baked Red Snapper. 

1 5-pound red snapper, 

1 beaten egg, 

i cupful powdered crackers, 

1 cupful oysters, 

1 teaspoonful onion juice, 

1 tablespoonful butter, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 

i teaspoonful paprika, 

1 tablespoonful minced parsley. 

Draw, clean, and wipe the fish; rub 
inside and out with salad oil and lem- 
on. Make a stuffing of egg, cracker, 
oysters (drained and chopj^ed), onion 
juice, butter, salt, paprika, and pars- 
ley; moisten with cream and oyster 
liquor. Fill the fish and sew it up. 
Put a layer of minced fat pork on the 
covered roaster, lay a few slices of to- 
mato and onion on the pork, then the 
fish on this. Dredge with salt and 
flour, and put on more minced pork. 
Place in a hot oven, add a cupful 
boiling water, and cover. When well 
heated, reduce the temperature. 
Baste frequently. Bake one hour. 
Serve with Sauce Hollandaise. 

Baked Fresh Cod with Cheese Sauce. 
Lay a slice of cod in salt and water 
for half an hour; wipe dry and rub 
with melted butter and lemon juice. 
In the bottom of the baking pan, un- 
der the grating and not touching the 



fish, have a cupful veal stock. Pep- 
per and salt the fish, cover and bake 
ten minutes to the pound. Take up 
on a hot platter and sift fine buttered 
crumbs over it. Set in the oven to 
brown while you strain the gravy 
from the pan, thicken with browned 
flour, add the juice of ^ lemon, i 
tablespoonfuls grated Parmesan 
cheese, and a little onion juice. Boil 
one minute, pour a few spoonfuls 
carefully over the crumb crust of the 
fish, the rest into a boat. — Marion 
Harland. 

Baked Bluefish. 

This recipe will answer for all sorts 
of fish. Have the fish opened at the 
gills, and the intestines drawn out 
through the opening. Make a stuffing 
of J pint bread crumbs, a tablespoon- 
ful melted butter, a teaspoonful salt, 
and a dash pepper. Mix the ingre- 
dients, fill the fish, and sew the head 
down firmly. If you use pork, cut 
the fish into gashes two inches apart 
and all the way across on one side 
down to the bone; fill the gashes with 
larding pork, dust the fish thickly 
with bread crumbs, baste it with a 
little melted butter, put ^ cupful wa- 
ter in the pan, and bake in a quick 
oven about an hour, basting fre- 
quently. Dish the fish carefully, gar- 
nish with parsley and lemon, and 
serve with brown or tomato sauce. — 
Sarah Tyson Rohrer. 

Bluefish Baked with Tomato Sauce. 

Prepare a fish of about 4 pounds, 
put in a buttered pan, cover with to- 
mato pulp, sprinkle liberally with 
bread crumbs, and dot with bits of 
butter. Place in oven forty minutes, 
until the flesh begins to separate from 
the back bone. 

Cod Steaks a la Cardinal (French 

recipe). 

Cut 3 pounds fresh cod into slices 
an inch thick; sprinkle with salt, pep- 
per, and lemon juice, fasten each 
slice with a toothpick to give it a 
neat shape. Brush the fish with 
warmed butter, lay it on the bottom 
of a large saucepan, pour over it a 
cupful white stock, and cover closely,

first with buttered paper, then with 
the pan lid. Simmer gently for 
twenty to twenty-five minutes, take 
skewers and arrange the fish neatly 
on a hot dish; pour over it tomato 
sauce, flavored with essence of an- 
chovy; garnish round the edge with 
sprigs of fresh parsley and slices of 
lemon. 

Fillets of Flounder a la Normandy. 

Prepare the fillets and lay in a but- 
tered baking pan, season with salt 
and pepper, dredge with flour, mois- 
ten with brown stock, adding a tea- 
spoonful lemon juice; lay the fillets 
on serving dish, and pour over them 
Normandy sauce, garnish with slices 
of lemon. 

Baked Haddock. 

Stuff witli a dressing, baste the fish 
with butter, put a cupful water into 
the pan, and bake in a moderate oven 
one hour, basting often; just before 
taking up, sprinkle a tablespoonful 
cracker crumbs over the fish and let 
it remain in the oven long enough to 
brown delicately. Put the fish on a 
warm platter, add water and thicken- 
ing to the gravy, serve in a gravy tu- 
reen, garnish with parsley and sliced 
lemon. 

Fish Timbales. 

J pound halibut or other white 

fish, 
Whites 5 eggs, 
1 teaspoonful salt, 
1 cupful soft bread crumbs, 
i cupful milk, 
6 tablespoonfuls cream, 
1 saltspoonful white pepper. 

Put the uncooked fish through the 
meat chopper. Cook together, until 
you have a smooth paste, the millv 
and bread crumbs. When cold, add 
it gradually to the fish and press 
through a sieve; add the cream, salt, 
and pepper, and fold in carefully the 
well-beaten whites of the eggs. 
Grease small timbale molds with but- 
ter, and line the bottoms with paper; 
garnish with chopped truffle, mush- 
rooms, or green peas, or they may be 
used plain. Fill in the mixture; 



stand in a baking pan half filled with 
hot water; cover the toji with greased 
paper, and bake in a moderate oven 
twenty minutes. Serve with lobster, 
shrimp, or oyster crab sauce. — Mrs. 
Sarah Tyson Rohrer. 

Baked Halibut. 

Take a square piece of fish, weigh- 
ing 5 pounds, wash, wipe dry, and 
place in the dripping pan with a few 
thin slices of salt pork on top. Bake 
one hour; baste with melted butter 
and water. Stir into the gravy 1 
tablespoonful Worcestershire Sauce, 
juice of 1 lemon, seasoning to taste, 
and thicken. Serve the gravy sejia- 
rate; garnish with slices of hard- 
boiled eggs. 

Baked Smelts. 

Dip in beaten egg, roll in cracker 
crumbs, season with salt, pepper, and 
a little nutmeg, lay on a sheet of but- 
tered paper in a buttered baking 
pan, put a piece of butter on each 
fish and bake delicately brown; serve 
on a hot dish, garnished with slices of 
lemon and parsley. 

Baked Salmon Trout with Cream. 

Wipe dry and lay in a pan with 
enough water to keep from scorching. 
Bake slowly an hour, basting with 
butter and water. Into a cupful 
cream stir 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls boil- 
ing water, add 2 tablespoonfuls melt- 
ed butter and a little chopped pars- 
ley; add it to the gravy from the 
dripping pan in which fish was baked; 
lay the trout on a hot platter and let 
the gravy boil up once, then pour 
over the fish; garnish with sprigs of 
parsley. 

Baked Shad. 

Stuff with a dressing; sprinkle the 
fish with liour, lay in a pan with a 
few thin slices of pork on top. Bake 
a medium-sized fish forty minutes; 
add a little hot water, butter, pepper, 
and salt to the gravy; boil up and 
serve in gravy tureen. Garnish tlie 
fish with sprigs of parsley. A table- 
spoonful anchovy sauce is a decided 
improvement by giving the gravy a 
better flavor.

roes on the crumbs, sprinkle with 
more crumbs seasoned and dressed 
like those in the pan. Over all pour a 
cupful white stock. Bake half an 
hour, drain off the liquid, sprinkle the 
roes with bread crumbs moistened 
with melted butter, put back in the 
oven for fifteen minutes to finish 
cooking and brown. Thicken the 
liquid that was poured off with flour 
blended with melted butter, and pour

Fish Dressing. 

Either of the following recipes may 
be used to prepare a stuffing for any 
fish: 3 cupfuls bread or cracker 
crumbs, 1 cupful mashed potatoes, 1 
well-beaten egg, 2 tablespoonfuls but- 
ter, teaspoonful sage and savory, or 
a little thyme, and 6 chopped clams 
or oysters; moisten with milk, salt, 
and pepper to taste. 

For a plainer dressing, use 1 pint 
bread crumbs, or one-half pint cracker 
crumbs, 4 tablespoonfuls melted but- 
ter, 1 egg, beaten, pepper, salt, 3 
tablespoonfuls chopped pickle, i tea- 
spoonful onion juice. 

FISH LEFT-OVERS. 

For fish rechauffes (left-overs) it 
is absolutely necessary to have a 
thorough knowledge of sauces. AVhen 
fish left-overs come from the table, 
pick them over carefully before they 
cool and become gelatinized. Reject 
every bone, and flake the eatable por- 
tions neatly. Put in a bowl, cover 
closely, and set in the refrigerator 
till required. Generally a fish re- 
chauffe with a sauce calls for a small 
amount of fish stock. To obtain this, 
put the bones, the poor pieces of fish 
and the skin into a small saucepan, 
cover with cold water, allow to sim- 
mer slowly for a few minutes, strain 
and cool. Never add salt to any fish 
without tasting, as it is very easy to 
overseason it. 

Croquettes are an excellent method 
for using up scraps of fish, especially 
salmon or any white-fleshed fish. 
When heated in a sauce, it can be 
served in ramequins or large scalloji 
shells which are sold by the dozen 



in crockery stores. With a crust of 
buttered crumbs, these individual 
dislies are very attractive. Delicious 
curries, soups, and deviled dishes 
may be prepared from cold fish. It 
can be combined with mashed pota- 
toes and crumbs in a pie; it makes a 
tempting souffle or excellent timbales, 
and may be used with cold potatoes 
for a hash. 

Save even a few spoonfuls of any 
sauce accompanying fish. Half a 
cupful of egg, tomato, shrimp, oyster, 
or plain white sauce adds much to the 
flavor of fresh sauce used for reheat- 
ing a dish. If the amount of fish is 
scant, add 2 or 3 hard-cooked eggs, 
using them as a garnish or cutting 
tlie white in rings and jjressing the 
yolk through a potato ricer or coarse 
sieve and sifting it over the top of 
the dish. 

Sometimes there are small left- 
overs of cooked oysters or clams. If 
the oysters are in a milk stew, strain 
off the liquor and save it. It may 
be enriched by a spoonful of butter 
or i cupful cream. Season well and 
heat in the double boiler, then add 
the oysters, but only just long enough 
to heat them. ^lore than a minute 
will overcook them. Oysters or clams 
which have been cooked in any way 
may be deviled, curried, or used in 
rissoles. Chop coarsely a cupful of 
cold scalloped oysters with a well- 
beaten egg and bread or cracker 
crumbs enough to make forming 
possible and shape into croquettes. 
Flour, egg, crumb, and fry. 

Lobster meat can be utilized in al- 
most any recipe that calls for that 
shellfish, or can be converted into 
delicate lobster soup. The smallest 
amount of fish or shellfish can be 
utilized for a sauce to accompany 
baked fish, lobster, oyster, and shrimp 
being most suitable.

Fried Oysters with Cold Slaw. 

Lay the oysters on a cloth to dry. 
Roll in cracker dust, then in egg di- 
luted with 1 tablcspoonful milk, sea- 
son with pepper and salt, again cover 
with cracker dust. Lay in a frying 
basket and fry in hot fat long enough 
to give them a light-brown color. 
Oysters toughen if cooked too long. 
Prepare only 4 at a time; more 
lower the temperature of the fat too 
much, and if they are rolled before 
the moment of frying, they moisten 
the cracker dust. Place them on an 
unglazed paper in the oven when they 
are fried. Fold a napkin and place 
it in the center of a platter. Pile 
the oysters on the napkin, and make 
a wreath around them of cold slaw.

FLAVORERS 

BROWNED FLOUR — FLAVORING VEGETABLES, HERBS AND 
SPICES — TLME OF COOKING FLAVORERS — TARRAGON VINE- 
GAR—SAVORY DRIPPINGS — RECIPES FOR FAMOUS SAUCES 



SAUCES 1 

The art of preparing savory gra- 
vies and sauces is more imi^ortant ia 
connection witla the serving of the 
cheaper meats than in connection 
witli the cooking of the more expen- 
sive. 

There are a few general principles 
underlying the making of all sauces 
or gravies, whether the liquid used is 
water, milk, stock, tomato juice, or 
some combination of these. For or- 
dinary gravy 2 level tablespoonfuls 
of flour or 1* tablespoonfuls of corn- 
starch or arrowroot is sufficient to 
thicken a cupful of liquid. This is 
true excepting when, as in certain 
recipes given elsewhere, the flour is 
browned. In this case about one- 
half tablespoonful more should be al- 
lowed, for browned flour does not 
thicken so well as unbrowned. The 
fat used may be butter or the drip- 
pings from the meat, the allowance 
Being 2 tablespoonfuls to a cup of 
liquid. 

The easiest way to mix the ingredi- 
ents is to heat the fat, add the flour, 
and cook until the mixture ceases 
to bubble, and then to add the liquid. 
This is a quick method and by using 
it there is little danger of getting a 
lumpy gravy. Many persons, how- 
ever, think it is not a wholesome 
method and prefer the old-fashioned

Home," by C. F. Langworthy, Pli.D., and 
Caroline L. Hunt, A.B. Fanners' Bul- 
letin No. 391.

one of thickening the gravy by means 
of flour mixed with a little cold wa- 
ter. The latter method is of course 
not practicable for brown gravies. 

Considering the large amount of 
discussion about the digestibility of 
fried food and of gravies made by 
heating flour in fat, a few words on 
the subject at this point may not 
be out of order. It is difficult to 
see how heating the fat before add- 
ing the flour can be unwholesome, un- 
less the cook is unskillful enough to 
heat the fat so high that it begins 
to scorch. Overheated fat, as has 
already been pointed out, contains 
an acrid irritating substance called 
" acrolein," which may be readily 
considered to be unwholesome. It is 
without doubt the production of this 
body by overheating which has given 
fried food its bad name. Several 
ways of varying the flavor of gravies 
and sauces were suggested in the 
preceding section. One other should 
be especially mentioned here. 

The Flavor of Browned Flour. 

The good flavor of browned flour 
is often overlooked. If flour is 
cooked in fat until it is a dark brown 
color a distinctive and very agree- 
able flavor is obtained. This flavor 
combines very well with that of cur- 
rant jelly and a little jelly added to 
a brown gravy is a great improve- 
ment. The flavor of this should not 
be combined with that of onions or 
other highly flavored vegetables.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Flavoring Vegetables, Herbs, Spices, 

Etc. 

Many flavorings are used in meat 
dishes, some of which are familiar 
to all cooks — onions, carrots, turnips, 
and garlic being perhaps the most 
widely known. Butter, too, may be 
regarded as one of the most common 
seasonings, and of course makes the 
dish richer. Meat extract is also 
used for flavoring many meat dishes 
and other foods, as are also, though 
less commonly, similar extracts made 
from clams or other " sea food." The 
following list includes these with 
various others, a number of which it 
is convenient to keep always on 
hand: Onions, carrots, green pep- 
pers parsnips, turnips, tomatoes, 
fresh, canned or dried; celery tops 
and parsley, either fresh or dried; 
sage, savory, thyme, sweet marjoram, 
bay leaf, garlic, lemon rind, vinegar, 
capers, pickles, olives, currant jelly, 
curry powder, cloves, peppercorns, 
celery seed, meat extract, Chili sauce, 
pepper sauce or some similar hot or 
sharp sauce and some kind of good 
commercial meat sauce. Some hints 
regarding the use of such flavorings 
follow : 

Flavor of Fried Vegetables. — Most 
of the stews, soups, braised meats, 
and pot roasts are very much im- 
proved if the flavoring vegetables 
which they contain, such as carrots, 
turnips, onions, celery, or green pep- 
pers, are fried in a little fat before 
being cooked with the meat. This 
need not complicate the preparation 
of the meat or increase the number 
of utensils used, for the meat itself 
is usually seared over in fat, and the 
vegetables can be cooked in the same 
fat before the browning of the meat. 

Onion Juice. — Cookbooks usually 
say that onion juice should be ex- 
tracted by cutting an onion in two 
and rubbing the cut surface against a 
grater. Considering how hard it is 
to wash a grater, this method has its 
drawbacks. Small amounts of juice 
may be obtained in the following sim- 
pler way: Peel the onion and ex- 
tract a few drops of juice by press- 
ing one side with the dull edge of a 
knife. 



Green Peppers. — The flavor of 
green peppers gives an acceptable 
variety. The seeds should always be 
removed. The peppers should be 
chopped and added to chopped meat 
or other meat dishes. Meat mixed 
with bread crumbs may be baked in 
the pepper shells and the stuffed 
peppers served as a separate dish. 

Parsley. — It is easy to raise pars- 
ley by growing it in a pot in the 
kitchen window and thus to have it 
always on hand fresh, or the leaves 
may be kept for a long time if 
sealed up in a fruit jar and stored 
in a cool place. Parsley, mint, and 
celery tops may all be dried, rubbed 
into fine bits, and kept in air-tight 
jars. Recipes usually say to chop 
fresh parsley with a sharp knife on 
a board. But a board is a hard 
thing to wash and a sheet of paper 
serves the purpose quite as well. 

Bay leaf. — Bay leaf is one of the 
best and at the same time one of the 
most abused flavors. In small quan- 
tities it gives a very pleasant flavor 
to soups and gravies but in large 
quantities it gives a disagreeable 
resin-like taste. Remember that half 
of a bay leaf is the allowance for 3 
quarts of soup stock. This will in- 
dicate how small a quantity should 
be used for the portion of gravy 
usually served at a meal. With this 
precaution in mind, bay leaf may be 
recommended as a flavoring for 
many sauces, particularly tomato 
sauce. 

A Kitchen Bouquet. — A " bou- 
quet" such as is often referred to in 
recipes may be made as follows: A 
sprig each of parsley, savory, and 
thyme, one small leaf of sage, and a 
bay leaf. This will flavor 1 gallon 
of soup when cooked in it for an 
hour and should not remain in it 
longer. 

Horse Radish. — Horse radish, like 
mustard, is more often served with 
meat than used to flavor it during 
cooking. A very palatable sauce, 
especially good with boiled beef, is 
made by adding grated horse radish 
and a " little vinegar to a little 
whipped cream, or as follows: 
Thicken milk with cracker crumbs 



MEAT AND FISH SAUCES AND FLAVORERS 179 



by heating them together in a double 
boiler, using 3 tablespoonfuls of 
cracker crumbs to li cups of milk. 
Add i of a cup of grated horse 
radish, 3 tablespoonfuls of butter, 
and i teaspoonful of salt; or thicken 
with butter and flour some of the 
water in which the meat was boiled, 
add a generous quantity (1 or 2 ta- 
blespoonfuls) of grated horse radish, 
boil a short time, and serve. This 
recipe is the most usual in German 
homes where the sauce is a favorite. 

Acid Flavoring. — Vinegar, lemon 
juice, and sour jelly, like currant, are 
often used to flavor the thick gravies 
which are a part of meat stew or 
which are served with it. Vinegar is 
an old-fashioned relish which was 
often added to bacon or salt pork 
and greens, pork and beans, corned 
beef and cabbage, and similar dishes. 
These flavors combine well with that 
of brown flour, but not with onions 
or other vegetables of strong flavor. 
The idea that vinegar used in small 
quantities is unwholesome seems to 
be without foundation. 

Pickles. — Chopped pickles are 
sometimes added to the gravy served 
with boiled mutton. They are 
cheaper than capers and serve some- 
what the same purpose. Chopped 
pickles are also very commonly used 
in sauces for fish and in many others 
to give a distinctive flavor. 

Olives. — Chopped olives also make 
a welcome variety in meat sauce, and 
are not expensive if they are bought 
in bulk. They will not spoil if a lit- 
tle olive oil is poured on the top of 
the liquor in which they are kei)t. 
This liquor should always completely 
cover them. 

Chili Sauce, Commercial Meat 
Sauces, Etc. — Recipes often may be 
varied by the addition of a little 
Chili sauce, tomato catsup, or a com- 
mercial meat sauce. These may be 
called emergency flavors and used 
when it is not convenient to prepare 
other kinds of gravies. 

Sausage. — A little sausage or 
chopped ham may be used in chopped 
beef. 

Curry Powder. — This mixture of 
spices which apparently originated in 



India, but which is now a common 
commercial product everywhere, is a 
favorite flavoring for veal, lamb, or 
poultry. The precaution mentioned 
in connection with bay leaves, how- 
ever, should be observed. A small 
amount gives a good flavor. It is 
usually used to season the thick 
sauces with which meats are served 
or in which they are allowed to 
simmer. While the terra " curry " 
is usually employed to describe a 
particular mixture of spices made up 
for the trade it has another mean- 
ing. The words " curry " or " cur- 
ried" are sometimes used to describe 
highly seasoned dishes of meat, eggs, 
or vegetables prepared by methods 
that have come from India or other 
parts of the East. 

Fried Vegetables for Seasoning. 

Vegetables when used raw as a 
seasoning give a strong flavor, and 
only a little of each should be used. 
For flavoring soups, sauces, stews, 
etc., fried vegetables are far su- 
perior to the raw. To prepare them 
for use, clean and peel or scrape the 
vegetables, then cut them into small 
pieces, and put in a saucepan with 
butter or sweet fat, allowing two 
generous tablespoonfuls of butter to 
a pint of vegetables. Place on a hot 
part of the range and stir imtil the 
butter and vegetables become hot. 
Partially cover the sauce])an and set 
back, where the vegetables, which 
should be stirred often, will cook 
slowly for half an hour. At the end 
of this time place the pan on a hot 
part of the range and stir the con- 
tents until the butter begins to sepa- 
rate fi-om the vegetables. Drain the 
butter, saving it with savory drip- 
pings, which every housewife should 
alwaj^s have on hand, and add the 
vegetables to the dish they are to 
flavor. 

Fine Herbs. 

In its broadest sense, the term 
" fine herbs " includes all the deli- 
cate, savory herbs, such as burnet, 
sweet basil, tarragon, and chervil. 
As commonly understood, three herbs 
enter into the seasoning known to 



180 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



cooks as "fine herbs"; these are 
parsley, chervil, and chives. They 
are minced fine and added to the 
sauce, soup, omelet, etc. For an 
omelet, they are stirred into the 
beaten eggs in the proportion of a 
teaspoonful to three eggs. When 
added to sauces, the herbs must be 
added just as they are about to be 
served. These three herbs combine 
well with almost any vegetable, fish, 
or meat. In general, herbs should be 
washed, placed on a clean board, and 
cut with a sliarp knife. 

Chervil and tarragon when em- 
ployed in soup or salad should be 
torn leaf by leaf into small pieces- 
Time of Cooking Flavorers. 

When a soup, sauce, or vegetable 
is to be flavored with an herb or an- 
other vegetable the flavorer should be 
added toward the end of the cooking 
period. Since the oils and other bod- 
ies which give seasoning vegetables 
and herbs their flavor are volatile 
they are either driven oflf bj'^ long- 
continue'd cooking or rendered much 
less delicate in flavor. Herbs that 
are to be left in the dish or served 
with the dish must be added just 
before the food is served. The herbs 
generally served with the dish are 
chervil, parsley, tarragon, and chives. 

Burnet, thyme, summer savory, 
sage, and sweet basil are cooked with 
the dish a short time, not over twenty 
minutes, and are then removed. 

The little bunch of mixed herbs, 
the " bouquet garni," so often re- 
ferred to in cook books, is made with 
two branches of parsley, a sprig each 
of thyme and summer savory, a small 
leaf of sage, and a small bay leaf, 
all tied together. This is cooked with 
the dish from ten to twenty minutes, 
then removed. The bay leaves must 
be purchased at the grocer's. Tur- 
nips, carrots, parsnips, celery, leeks, 
cibol, onions, etc., when used just as 
flavorers, should be tied in a bunch 
and cooked twenty or thirty minutes 
in the dish and then be removed. 

When shallot and garlic are used 
they should be separated into 
" cloves," and then cut -fine. One 
clove will be enough for a small quan- 



tity of soup, sauce, or ragout. Never 
fry shallot or garlic. Cook in the 
dish to be flavored about ten minutes, 
then remove. — Maria Parloa. 

Tarragon Vinegar. 

Strip about three ounces of leaves 
from the branches of tarragon; put 
into a quart fruit jar and fill with 
good vinegar. Close and let stand 
for about twenty days, then strain. 
The best vinegar to use for this pur- 
pose is white wine vinegar, but good 
cider vinegar will also answer. The 
best time to make tarragon vinegar 
is about the last of August, when 
the plants are large and vigorous. 
Tarragon vinegar may be used for 
salads and sharp sauces, w^hen the 
fresh herb is not available. — Maria 
Parloa. 

Butter with Vegetables. 

It is almost universally conceded 
that vegetables require the addition 
of fat in order that they may be at 
their best, and there is no fat which 
is so suitable as butter for the ma- 
jority of vegetables, judged by the 
texture of the dish and also by the 
flavor. 

The American housekeeper has a 
way of looking upon the use of but- 
ter, milk, cream, and eggs in the 
preparation of vegetables, soups, and 
sauces as if these ingredients were 
simply " trimmings " and not food. 
But it should be remembered that 
these articles are valuable foods and 
naturally increase the food value of 
the dish of which they form a part. 
They are all wholesome, and, although 
almost always more expensive than 
the vegetable foods with which they 
are combined, their use in reasonable 
quantities is certainly to be recom- 
mended. 

Increasing the cost of the dish by 
the free use of butter, cream, etc., 
may after all be economy if the in- 
crease is intelligently made, and the 
vegetable soujjs, purees, etc., made 
" hearty " as well as appetizing by the 
addition of butter, eggs, etc., are 
combined with smaller quantities of 
meat and with light and simple des- 
serts. — Maria Parloa. 



MEAT AND FISH SAUCES AND FLAVORERS 181 



Savory Drippings. 

As a substitute for butter in sea- 
soning vegetables there is nothing bet- 
ter than sweet, savory drippings. Not 
all meats supply fats that are savory 
in the sense in which the word is em- 
ployed here. The following fats may 
be eraploj^ed alone or in combination 
for seasoning vegetables: The fat 
from fried sausages, ham, bacon, and 
pork, and from roast pork, veal, and 
chicken. Fats trimmed from poultry, 
veal, pork, and ham may be fried out 
carefully and saved for use in cook- 
ing vegetables. Such fats have a 
flavor which comes from seasoning, 
as in sausage, from smoke, as in ham 
and bacon, or from brown material, 
as in roast meat. The fat skimmed 
from the water in which poultry has 
been boiled and the fats skimmed 
from the gravies of most roast meats 
may be clarified and also employed in 
the preparation of vegetables for the 
table. Great care must be taken that 
all these fats are clean and sweet, 
and that the temperature at which 
they are fried out shall not be so 
high as to impair the flavor. Burned 
or scorched fat is not only unpleasant 
in flavor, but is a frequent cause of 
indigestion. 

When rendering the trimmings of 
fat meat, add a small onion or a 
shallot (do not cut them), a few 
leaves of summer savory and thyme, 
a teaspoonful of salt, and a little 
pepper. This seasoning is enough for 
half a pint of fat. Keep the drip- 
pings covered, and in a cool, dry 
place. — Maria Parloa.

CHAPTER XV 
EGGS AND EGG DISHES 

BOILED EGGS — BAKED EGGS — POACHED EGGS — FRIED EGGS 
— FANCY EGG DISHES — OMELETS, ETC., ETC. 



When we considei' that nine eggs 
are equal in nutritive value to a 
pound of meat, we realize they are 
not only capable of forming a most 
important item in everyday diet, but 
also an economical food during the 
season when eggs ai-e cheap. Even 
when eggs are expensive, it is econ- 
omy to use only the best grade. Eggs 
that cost fifty cents a dozen are 
cheaper than eggs at twenty-five 
cents provided half of the dozen are 
stale or worse. 

There are a number of household 
tests of the freshness of eggs. The 
most reliable is to candle them. 
Hold the egg in the hand with the 
fingers wrapped about it and look 
through it against a bright light. In 
a perfectly fresh egg, you can see 
the yolk liice a golden ball. The white 
about it will be clear as water. Or 
you may droja an egg into a basin 
of water; if perfectly fresh, it will 
sink and rest on its side. If it rolls 
around standing on its end, it is com- 
paratively fresh; if it floats, you 
would better discard it unopened. 
When an egg is perfectly fresh it has 
a porous, dull surface; if shiny, it is 
pretty sure to be at least stale. 

There are three ways in which eggs 
are generally used for breakfast or 
lunciieon dishes: in a soft-cooked con- 
dition as in a poached egg; hard- 
boiled as in a salad; or with the yolk 
and white separated and beaten to a 
froth as in an omelet. Eggs are 
quickest digested in the soft-cooked 
stage, but to many are difficult of 
digestion when hard-boiled. Eggs 



are deficient in fat; therefore they 
should be served with bacon, witli an 
oil mayonnaise in salad, or with bread 
and butter. Indeed, their highly 
concentrated, nutritive properties de- 
mand always an accompaniment of 
some starchy food, such as potatoes 
or bread. 

To Preserve Egg Yolks. 

Often after baking, several egg 
yolks are left over. They will keep 
fresh for days without drying if put 
in a cup and covered with cokl 
water. The membrane about the yoUc 
must not be broken. — Lillie Nelson. 

To Boil Cracked Eggs. 

When boiling a cracked egg add a 
teaspoonful of salt to the water, and 
you will find that it cooks witli- 
out any of the white leaving the shell. 
— Helen A. Lyman. 

Soft Cooked Eggs. 

Drop eggs into boiling water, and 
place where they will keep below the 
boiling point (180 degrees) for six 
or eight minutes. The whites should 
be soft and jelly like, and the yolks 
soft, but not liquid. 

Hard Cooked Eggs. 

Cook twenty or twenty-five minutes, 
in place where they will keep below 
the boiling point (180 degrees) — a 
double-boiler is a good utensil to use. 

Baked Eggs. 

Eggs (as many as needed), 
Crackers,

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



2 tablespoonfuls milk to each egg, 

Butter, 

Salt, 

Pepper, 

Grease a gem pan well and break 
an egg into eacli cup or as many as 
you need. Cover with a thin layer 
of crackers. Add salt and pepper to 
taste, a small piece of butter and 
milk. Bake until done. Serve at 
once. — Zilda Southard. 

Poached Eggs. 

A deep spider is the best utensil in 
which to poach eggs. Fill it nearly 
full of boiling water which has been 
slightly salted. Break in a saucer, 
and drop into boiling water, cook- 
ing slowly, until the whites are like 

jelly. 

Poached Eggs Ball-Shaped. 

Have a shallow saucepan half full 
of water; add salt and a few table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar. When the 
water is boiling, stir with a wooden 
spoon until you start a sort of whirl- 
pool, then into the center of it drop 
an egg from a cup. The egg will 
cook in a rounded form. When the 
white is set, lift it from the water 
and set it on a slice of toast. 

Eggs Poached in Milk. 

Instead of using water to poach 
eggs, drop them into boiling milk; 
as soon as the egg is set, lay it on a 
slice of toast. Thicken the milk with 
a little flour, add butter, salt, pepper, 
and a dash of celery salt; pour it over 
the eggs and around the toast. 

Frizzled Beef with Poached Eggs. 
i pound finely chipped beef, 
1 cupful millt, 
1 tablespoonful butter, 
1 tablespoonful flour. 

Put the butter to melt in a sauce- 
pan, add the flour and stir it to a 
paste, then put in the milk, scalding 
hot, and beat with a wire whisk un- 
til creamy. Add the beef and stir 
for a few minutes. Turn into a deep 
platter and cover the top with 
poached eggs. 



Eggs in Ramequins. 

Butter small ramequins and drop 
a raw egg into each one, being care- 
ful that it remains whole. Set the 
ramequins in a pan of boiling water 
and put it in a hot oven until the 
eggs are set. Put a dab of butter on 
each one and a dust of pepper and 
salt before taking from the oven. 

Eggs Baked in Tomatoes. 

Pick out several well-shaped toma- 
toes, cut off the stem ends, and with 
a spoon lift out enough of the pulp 
so that each shell will hold an egg. 
Drop it in carefully, sprinkle with 
pepper and salt, put a dab of butter 
on top of each; place the tomatoes in 
a baking dish and pour the water 
around them. Cook until the eggs 
are set and the tomatoes soft. Lift 
each one on a slice of buttered toast, 
and serve. 

Eggs Baked in Green Peppers, 

Cut off the steins of green peppers, 
scoop out the seeds and ribs, and par- 
boil until tender. Break an egg into 
each one. Set them in a baking pan 
with * cupful boiling water poured 
around. In fifteen minutes the eggs 
should be firm. Set each one on a 
slice of buttered toast and, if you 
wish, pour white sauce or tomato 
sauce about them. 

Eggs in Tomato Sauce (Spanish rec- 
ipe). 

Cover the bottom of an earthen 
baking dish with well-seasoned to- 
mato pur4e. Arrange on it poached 
eggs, leaving spaces to show the red 
color. Lay between the eggs small 
sausages, already cooked. Place a 
bit of butter on each egg and set the 
dish in the oven to heat. 

Eggs with Bread Sauce. 
1 cupful bread crumbs, 
IJ cupfuls milk, 
i teaspoonful salt, 
i teaspoonful onion juice, 
6 eggs. 

Put the bread crumbs in a sauce- 
pan, then add the milk, salt, a dash 
of cayenne, and the onion juice.

Simmer slowly till thick and smooth, 
beating several times with a spoon. 
Pour the sauce into a broad, shallow 
dish and break the eggs carefully 
over it. Place in a hot oven until 
they are set. 

Eggs on Rice. 

Butter a baking dish, fill it half 
full with well-seasoned boiled rice; 
make as many depressions in the rice 
as there are people to be served; 
break an egg into each one, sprinkle 
with salt and strew with bits of but- 
ter. Bake until the eggs are set. 

Eggs and Mushrooms. 
i cupful milk, 
1 pound mushrooms, 
1 tablespoonful butter, 
6 poached eggs, 
Dash tabasco sauce. 

Peel and wash the mushrooms; 
place them in a saucepan and cook 
gently, with the butter, milk, a pinch 
of salt and tabasco. Cook ten min- 
utes, thicken with flour, let come to a 
boil, then pour on a hot platter. 
Have your poached eggs ready; serve 
on top of the sauce, the mushrooms 
being in the middle. 

Cheesed Eggs. 

Place in a baking dish a table- 
spoonful butter and several slices rich 
cheese. When it is melted, break 
whole eggs into it; put the dish into 
the oven. When the white sets, sprin- 
kle grated cheese and pepper on them. 
Brown on top, and serve. 

Eggs a la Bonne Femme (French 

recipe). 

Cut an onion in thin slices; fry 
with a tablespoonful butter; add a 
tablespoonful vinegar; then butter a 
dish lightly, spread the onions over it, 
break in the eggs, and put the dish 
in the oven. When the eggs are 
done, strew over them fried bread 
crumbs, and serve hot. 

Eggs in Nests. 

Separate as many eggs as are need- 
ed for this dish and beat the whites 
to a stiff froth. Drop irregularly 



on a flat buttered baking dish, dust 
with pepper and salt here and there, 
in the middle of the white, slide in 
carefully the raw yolks. Put a tiny 
bit of butter on each yolk. Place the 
dish in a hot oven until the egg is set. 
Serve immediately. If desired, the 
froth may be piled into individual 
dishes with the yolk in the center of 
each and baked as described. 

Soft Cooked Eggs. 

Put into a saucepan where the 
water is boiling, move to the back of 
the stove, and if you wish them soft, 
let them stand in the hot water for 
seven minutes. 

Poached Eggs with Greens. 

For this dish use outer leaves of 
lettuce; wash them thoroughly and 
boil until tender in salted water. 
Drain, chop fine, and season with 
salt, pepper, and butter. Toast a 
few slices of bread, butter them, cov- 
er with the chopped greens, and on 
top of each drop a poached egg. 

Fried Eggs. 

Fry thin slices of bacon to a crisp, 
lift them out and lay on a hot plat- 
ter. Break into the pan as many 
eggs as you need; let them cook until 
the white is set, and baste with hot 
fat till a film forms over the j'olk. 
If you like them turned, run a knife 
under each and reverse quiclvly. 
Serve on a platter with the crisp 
bacon. 

Fried Eggs with Brown Sauce. 

Fry eggs in butter in a spider, lift 
them and keep hot over boiling water. 
If there is not enough gravy in the 
pan, put in a little more butter, 1 
tablespoonful vinegar, a dash of 
onion juice, salt, pepper, and a few 
drops of tabasco sauce. Thicken 
slightly with flour, beat till creamy, 
and strain the brown gravy over 
eggs.

KINDS OF CHEESE USED IN 
AMERICAN HOMES 

The American factorj^ cheese — the 
so-called American cream cheese — is 
of the English Cheddar type, and as 
it is the most commonly used of all 
the commercial varieties in the United 
States, may be taken as a standard. 
Other types are, however, well known, 
particularly in cities and large towns 
where there are well stocked markets 
and stores, and it is interesting to 
note also, at least briefly, the char- 
acteristics of some of them. 

Cheddar and American Full Cream 
Cheese. 

Cheddar cheese — named from the 
English village where it originated — 
is a comparatively old type of cheese, 
very popular in England and also in 
the United States. The name is now 
more fitly applied to a process than to 
any particular shape. 

Cheddar cheese is made from sweet 
cows' milk, which may be skimmed, 
partly skimmed, or unskimmed. If 
made from unskimmed milk the 
cheese is called "full cream." If 
cream is removed the cheese is desig- 
nated " part-skim " or " skim," as the 
case may be. 



1 U. S. Department of Agriculture. Farm- 
•s" Bulletin No. 487. ,„^ 

192 



Cheese of Cheddar type as made in 
the United States is perhaps most 
often marketed in large, flat, round 
forms, 13 to 16 inches in diameter, 
about 5 or 6 inches in height, and 
weighing 26 to 33 pounds each, 
though other shapes and sizes are also 
fairly common. It is usually pale to 
darker yellow in color, though it may 
be white when uncolored. When 
fresh it is mild in flavor, but when 
well ripened has a characteristic and 
sharp taste. The new cheese is soft, 
though not waxy, in texture, and may 
be easily shaved or broken into small 
pieces. When weU ripened it may be 
finely grated. 

These characteristics, together with 
its distinctive and peculiar flavor and 
its wide distribution in the markets, 
are qualities which help to make it 
the variety most commonly used in the 
United States. 

Sage cheese is a variety of Ched- 
dar cheese, which is flavored with 
sage and is further characterized by 
the green mottled appearance for- 
merly due to bits of sage leaf but 
now generally obtained in another 
way. 

English Dairy Cheese. 

From the standpoint of the cook 
who frequently wishes to use grated 
cheese this variety is important. 



CHEESE AND ITS ECONOMICAL USES 



193 



Though made in much the same way 
as Cheddar, it differs from it, in that 
the curd is heated to a somewhat 
higher temperature, and the cheese is 
therefore harder. It commonly sells 
for somewhat more per pound than 
the standard or American factory va- 
riety and is likely to be found only 
in the larger markets. 

Soft Cream Cheeses. 

Cream cheese true to name is made 
from rich cream thickened by sour- 
ing or from sweet cream thickened 
with rennet. The whey is removed by 
draining. It is then covered, salted, 
and turned occasionally, being ready 
for market in 5 to 10 days. A va- 
riety is also made with rennet from 
cream of low fat content, as well as a 
number of other special sorts much 
more common in France than in the 
United States. 

The term " cream cheese," however, 
is an elastic one and includes many 
varieties which are sold under special 
trade names. Such cheese is common 
in most markets. 

Soft cream cheese differs from 
standard cheese, so far as composi- 
tion is concerned, in having more wa- 
ter and fat and less protein, water 
usually making up about one-half of 
the total weight. It differs also in 
being much more perishable. These 
cheeses commonly sell for 10 or 15 
cents each, which is about 40 to 50 
cents a pound. 

Of late there have been on the mar- 
ket varieties of such cheese or of 
Neufchatel, made by combining the 
cheese with chopped pimiento. These 
bring a reljftively high price in mar- 
ket and may be easily prepared at 
home if this seems more convenient. 

Neufchatel Cheese. 

This very popular variety — named 
from a town in Northeastern France 
— is similar in appearance and in the 
way it is marketed to soft cream 
cheese. It is made either from whole 
or skim milk curdled with rennet. 
After draining and pressing, it is 
kneaded thoroughly, formed into 
small rolls or blocks, and then rip- 
ened until special molds develop, 



which requires about four weeks. It 
is then wrapped in tinfoil and mar- 
keted. 

Parmesan Cheese. 

This is a name given outside of 
Italy to a very hard cheese which in 
that country is said to be known as 
Grana, a name given because of the 
granular appearance which it has 
after it has been broken. It is some- 
times sold in grated form and brings 
a relatively high price, but is more 
commonly sold ungrated. When well 
made it will keep for years and may 
be easily broken and grated. It is 
very generally used in Europe for 
serving with soups, for seasoning 
macaroni, and for other similar pur- 
jjoses, and is quite common in Ameri- 
can markets. 

Sap Sago. 

This is a skim milk cheese made in 
Switzerland, wliich is suitable for 
grating. It contains, for every 4 
pounds of cheese, 1 pound of a clover 
(Melilotus cceruleus) grown in Switz- 
erland. It is greenish in color and 
has an unusual flavor. It is not high 
priced. 

Gorgonzola and Roquefort. 

These are highly flavored cheeses 
characterized by the ])resence of 
molds through their entire mass. 
Roquefort is made from the milk of 
sheep; Gorgonzola, from cows' milk. 

Potted or Sandwich Cheeses. 

Ordinary cheese is often mixed 
with butter or oil in the proportion 
of 5 parts of cheese to 1 of butter or 
oil, by weight. The mixture is some- 
times seasoned with mustard or with 
curry powder. Such cheeses, unsea- 
soned or seasoned, are on the market 
in great variety. Potted cheese may 
be easily prepared at home if the 
housekeeper wishes to take the trou- 
ble. 

Swiss Cheese (Emmentaler, GruySre, 
Etc.). 

This term as used in America is 
somewhat vague. Different names are 
given to the varieties according to 



194 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



the districts of Switzerland in which 
they are made, but they are all similar 
and characterized by a mild, sweetish 
flavor and the presence of large holes 
or " eyes." Foreign and domestic 
brands are to be found in most mar- 
kets. They are suitable for cooking 
purposes, as well as for use without 
being cooked, and are much used in 
this way in Europe and well known 
and liked in the United States. 

Edam Cheese. 

This is a cheese made in Holland. 
It is molded in spherical form, and 
the outside is usually dyed red. It 
is usual in this country to cut ofiF a 
section of the top, which serves as a 
lid, and to scoop out the inside as 
needed. In Holland it is frequently 
served in slices, particularly when it 
is fresh. Edam cheese is seldom used 
in cookery in American homes, 
though thrifty housewives, after the 
greater part of the cheese has been 
removed, often stuff the hollow shell 
with cooked and seasoned macaroni, 
rice, or something similar and bake. 

Brie and Camembert Cheese. 

These are very soft rennet cheeses 
of foreign origin and of somewhat 
smaller nutritive value than standard 
cheese, and of strong flavor and odor. 
They are not often used in cookery, 
but are used as an accompaniment to 
other foods. 

Cottage Cheese. 

Cottage cheese and other sour 
milk and cream cheeses, junket, Dev- 
onshire cream, and a number of other 
cheese-like products are described in 
the section which deals with home- 
made cheese. 

The Care of Cheese in the Home. 

One of the best ways of keeping 
cheese which has been cut is to wrap 
it in a slightly damp cloth and then 
in paper, and to keep it in a cool 
place. To dampen the cloth, sprinkle 
it and then wring it. It should seem 
hardly damp to the touch. Paraffin 
paper may be used in place of the 
cloth. "When cheese is put in a cov- 
ered dish, the air should never be 



wholly excluded, for if this is done, 
it molds more readily. 

In some markets it is possible to 
buy small whole cheeses. These may 
be satisfactorily kept by cutting a 
slice from the top, to serve as a cover, 
and removing the cheese as needed 
with a knife, a strong spoon, or a 
cheese scoop. It is possible to buy 
at the hardware stores knobs which 
inserted in the layer cut from the 
top make it easy to handle. The 
cheese below the cover should be kept 
wrapped in a cloth. 

Cheese as a Food. 

Cheese is used in general in two 
ways — in small quantities chiefly for 
its flavor and in large quantities for 
its nutritive value as well as for its 
flavor. Some varieties of cheese are 
used chiefly for the first purpose, 
others chiefly for the second. Those 
which are used chiefly for their flavor, 
many of which are high priced, con- 
tribute little to the food value of the 
diet, because of the small quantity 
used at a time. They have an impor- 
tant part to play, however, in making 
the diet attractive and palatable. 
The intelligent housekeeper thinks of 
them not as necessities, but as lying 
within what has been called " the re- 
gion of choice." Having first satis- 
fied herself that her family is receiv- 
ing sufficient nourishment, she then, 
according to her means and ideas of 
an attractive diet, chooses among 
these foods and others which are to 
be considered luxuries. 

Those cheeses, on the other hand, 
which are suitable to be eaten in large 
quantities and which are compara- 
tively low priced are important not 
only from the point of view of flavor, 
but also from tlie point of view of 
their nutritive value. Among such 
cheeses the one which, as noted above, 
is known to the trade as standard 
factory cheese and to the housewife 
as American cheese stands out pre- 
eminently. Therefore when the word 
" cheese " is used without specification 
in the following pages it may be 
taken to refer to this particular va- 
riety. 

The Use of Cheese in the Diet. — It 



CHEESE AND ITS ECONOMICAL USES 



195 



has been the purpose, in preparing 
this discussion of cheese, to consider 
Avays in which mild flavored sorts 
may serve as staple articles of diet, 
rather than the use of highly fla- 
vored varieties as appetizers and as 
accompaniments of other foods. The 
use of highly flavored cheese as a 
condiment is customary and may 
profitably be extended, since it of- 
fers a simple way of adding to the 
attractiveness of the diet. The va- 
riety of the cheese selected is a mat- 
ter of choice, some persons prefer- 
ring such kinds as well-ripened 
American full cream cheese or the 
potted cheeses, and others such sorts 
as Roquefort, Camembert, and other 
varieties. From the physiologist's 
standpoint, cheese used in this way 
for its flavor should really form a 
part of a well-balanced meal rather 
than be added to a meal which al- 
ready supplies an abundance of nu- 
tritive material. In other words, con- 
dimental cheeses may better accom- 
pany a moderate than a very gener- 
ous menu. 

In considering the use of cheese in 
quantity as an integral part of the 
diet there are many possibilities from 
simple combinations like bread and 
cheese to elaborate dishes in which 
cheese is used as a flavor and as a 
principal constituent. 

As has been pointed out, cheese, 
being rich in both protein and fat, 
would logically rejilace such foods as 
meat, fish, and eggs, when taken in 
quantity, rather than cereal foods 
characterized by a large amount of 
starch, or succulent foods, such as 
vegetables and fruits. In planning 
menus of which cheese forms a large 
part the housekeeper should bear 
these facts in mind. 

Bill-of-Fare Making with Cheese 
as the Central Food. — Since meat 
has so generally been the chief pro- 
tein food of a meal, and the kind 
selected usually has determined the 
choice of vegetables and condiments, 
it is not strange that very many 
housekeepers should be inexperienced 
and consequently unskillful in plan- 
ning meals in which cheese is substi- 
tuted for meat when for any reason 



they may desire to make such a 
change. In seeking skill they might 
take a suggestion from the experi- 
ments to which reference has been 
made, and also from a case investi- 
gated and reported by the Office of 
Experiment Stations, of a man who 
lived for months upon a diet of bread, 
fruit, and cheese, and who remained 
in good health and active, and did 
not weary of the monotony of the 
diet. 

The first two articles of the diet 
mentioned, namely, the bread and 
the cheese, could have been taken in 
such amounts as to constitute what 
is usually considered a balanced ra- 
tion, i. e., in such amounts as to sup- 
ply the right quantity of muscle 
forming foods in comparison with the 
energy value. The bread and cheese 
taken with the fruit, however, make 
a ration which is well balanced not 
only in the older and more widely 
accepted sense, but also in the more 
modern sense that it makes an at- 
tractive and palatable combination of 
foods, as well as a balanced ration, 
and thus favors digestion. The wa- 
tery and refreshing fruits or succu- 
lent vegetables with their large sup- 
ply of cellulose are a pleasant con- 
trast to the concentrated and fatty 
cheese. 

Housekeepers would probably find 
that if in planning menus of which 
a cheese dish is the chief feature they 
were to take pains to supply also 
crisp, watery vegetables, water cress, 
celery, lettuce, served with a dressing 
or with salt alone, or simple fruit 
salads, and would give preference to 
refreshing fruits, either fresh or 
cooked, rather than to what are 
known as heavy desserts, they would 
in general be more successful in 
pleasing those who are served. 

There is another point also to be" 
considered in combining cheese with 
other foods. Whether it is raw or 
cooked it is likely to be somewhat 
soft, and so seems to call for the 
harder kinds of bread — crusty rolls 
or biscuit, zwieback, toast, pulled 
bread, rye bread, the harder brown 
breads, or crackers, and some of the 
numerous crisp ready-to-eat cereal

breakfast foods. Brittle cookies, too, 
seem more suitable than rich soft 
cakes or puddings for the dessert in 
such meals. 

A few bills of fare are given below 
which experience has shown to repre- 
sent combinations of dishes which are 
palatable and which, if eaten in usual 
amoimts, will su])ply protein and 
energy in proportions which accord 
with usual dietary standards. Menus 
such as these are more commonly 
served at lunch or at supper, but they 
might equally well be served for din- 
ner, the selection of dishes for any 
meal being of course chiefly a matter 
of custom and convenience for those 
who have any range of choice. 

Suggested bills of fare in which 
cheese dishes are the chief source of 
protein and fat. 

Menu No. 1. 
Macaroni and cheese. 
Raisin bread or date bread. 
Orange and water cress salad. 
Baked apples. 
Sugar cookies. 
Cocoa. 

Menu No. 2. 
Cheese fondue. 
Toast, zwieback, or thin and crisp 

baking-powder biscuit. 
Celery. 
Potatoes, baked, boiled, or fried in 

deep fat. 
Peas, or some other fresh vegetable. 
Coffee. 
Fruit salad with crisp cookies or 

meringues. 

Menu No. 3. 
Clear soup. 
Baked eggs with cheese or Boston 

roast. 
Baked potatoes. 
Lettuce salad. 
A sweet jelly, crab apple or quince 

for example, or a preserve. 
Rye bread. 

Orange or banana shortcake. 
Tea. 

These bills of fare should be taken as 
suggestive merely and not as a solu- 
tion of the problem. In fact, the 



whole art of making bills of fare 
needs developing. 'I'here is abundant 
evidence that overeating, where it ex- 
ists, is frequently due to the fact 
that meals are not skillfully planned. 
People often continue eating after 
they have taken enough in total bulk 
because they have not had all they 
want of some particular kind of food. 
The meal has contained too large a 
percentage of proteid or too much 
starch; has been too moist or too dry; 
too highly flavored or not sufficiently 
flavored. Bill-of-fare making calls 
not only for knowledge of food values 
but also for skill in combining flavors 
and textures. 

In this discussion of menu making, 
and of the use of cheese as an inte- 
gral part of the diet, the aim has been 
to suggest ways of using cheese to 
add to the palatability of meals made 
up of usual dishes, and to suggest 
dishes containing cheese which could 
serve as substitutes for meat dishes 
when so desired, and also for dishes 
of many sorts to be used as taste sug- 
gests and in which the nutritive value 
as well as the flavor is increased by 
the addition of cheese. If cheese is 
used and in quantity, it is obvious 
that some other proteid and fat foods 
should be diminished, in order that 
the meal or day's menu may not be 
unduly hearty. 

For the convenience of the house- 
keeper, a number of recipes for 
cheese dishes are given in later pages, 
these being preceded by directions for 
making cottage cheese and other simi- 
lar cheeses which are usually made in 
the home. 

Homemade Cheese. 

Even as late as a generation or two 
ago cheese of different kinds was 
made at home for family use, as sour- 
milk or cottage cheese still is, and 
cheese making was very generally a 
farm industry, cheese, like butter, be- 
ing sold by the farmer who made it. 
Cottage cheese is very commonly 
homemade. Most types of cheese, 
however, are now as a rule made on a 
large scale in factories where advan- 
tage may be taken of labor-saving de- 
vices. 



CHEESE AND ITS ECONOMICAL USES 



197 



Curds and Whey. 

Cheese curds and whey, an old- 
fashioned dish, which is often spoken 
of in accounts of life in earlier times, 
sometimes refers to sour-nuli< curds 
and sometimes to curd separated with 
rennet. This dish when made with 
rennet is much like junket and 
though far less common to-day than 
was once the case is wholesome and 
palatable. 

Cottage Cheese. 

This cheese is very commonly pre- 
pared in the home, and the process of 
making it is very simple. It consists 
merely of curdling the milk, separat- 
ing the curd from the whey, seasoning, 
and pressing it. 

The curd is formed by the souring 
of the milk, and the process is has- 
tened if the milk is kept warm, the 
best temperature being about blood 
heat, 96° F. A temperature much 
above this should be avoided, as the 
curd is likely to become hard and 
tough if much heated. The danger is 
usually not that the whole will be 
overheated but that the portion near- 
est the fire will be. In the old- 
fashioned kitchen there was usually a 
place where the milk could stand till 
it was uniformly warm throughout. 
With our present cooking arrange- 
ments it is often desirable to hasten 
the process. This may be done by 
setting the milk into a pan of warm 
water or by pouring hot water di- 
rectly into the milk itself. The ef- 
fect of the latter method is to re- 
move much more of the acid than 
when the whey is left undiluted. 
Some consider this a great advantage. 
If, for any reason, the curd is 
overheated, it should be put through a 
meat chopper. This will insure cot- 
tage cheese of excellent texture. 

If the milk is thoroughly chilled be- 
fore the whey is drained off it re- 
tains more of the fat than if this is 
done when warm. Under no circum- 
stances, however, is much of the fat 
retained in cottage cheese. It is 
therefore more economical to make 
it out of skim milk and to add the 
fat to the curd in the form of butter 
or cream. 



Chopped parsley, caraway seeds, 
chopped olives, and pimiento may all 
be used for flavoring if such flavored 
cheese is preferred to plain cottage 
cheese. 

Cottage cheese is most commonly 
consumed immediately, but if made in 
quantity for commercial purposes, it 
may be packed in tubs and placed in 
cold storage. Sometimes it is formed 
into rolls or blocks and wrapped in 
tinfoil when marketed. Such cheese 
is used without ripening. 

Though cottage cheese is usually 
made by allowing the milk to sour 
naturally, it is sometimes more con- 
venient to curdle the milk by adding 
rennet, and some housekeepers have a 
preference for cottage cheese thus 
made, since the flavor is milder and 
the acid taste which it possesses when 
made from sour milk is lacking. 

Sour-Cream Cheese. 

When cream is to be made into 
cheese similar to cottage cheese, it 
should be drained without having pre- 
viously been heated. The drainage is 
facilitated by moistening the cloth in 
salt water before the cream is poured 
in. The curd is formed either by 
souring or by the addition of rennet. 

Uncooked Curd, or French Cottage 
Cheese. 

The French make cheese from sour 
milk without heating it. They pour 
the milk into earthen molds which 
have holes in the bottom. A very fine 
sieve may be used instead of the 
molds. The whey drips out and the 
curd assumes a custardlike consist- 
ency and takes the shape of the mold. 
When sufficiently stiff, the cheese is 
chilled, and is eaten with sweet cream 
and sugar. It is a staple dessert in 
many French families, especially in 
hot weather, and is delicious served 
with acid fruit, such as currants, or 
with strawberries. 

Junket. 

If cottage cheese is made from 
sweet milk and rennet and served 
without breaking and separating the 
curd antl whey, the dish is called 
junket. It is customary to season it 



198 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



a little, as with grated nutmeg or 
with cinnamon and sugar. 

Buttermilk Cheese. 

To maiie buttermilk cheese, heat 
buttermilli to about 130° or 140° F. 
Allow it to cool and strain it. As 
the curd will settle to the bottom, 
most of the whey may be poured off 
before the draining is begun. 

This cheese is, of course, almost 
'wholly without fat and yet, probably 
because the particles of curd are very 
finely divided, it has a smooth con- 
sistency, which suggests the presence 
of fat. It may be served seasoned 
with salt only, or it may be mixed 
with butter or cream and seasonings. 
It is suitable for combining with 
olives and pimientos, as elsewhere 
recommended, or for any use to 
which the ordinary cream cheeses are 
put. 

Buttermilk Cream. 

By controlling the temperature in 
heating the buttermilk and not allow- 
ing it to go above 100° F., a com- 
pound is made which after draining 
has the consistency of a very thick 
cream. It is claimed tliat this 
" cream " is suitable for eating on 
bread in place of butter. 

The recii)es given on other pages 
suggest ways of making a salad 
dressing out of buttermilk cream. 

Devonshire Cream. 

Devonshire cream somewhat resem- 
bles sweet cream in flavor and con- 
sistency. It is very much liked in 
England, where it is commonly eaten 
with fresh or preserved fruit, but it 
is not so well known in America. 

To make Devonsliire cream, allow a 
pan of whole milk to stand for 24 
hours in a cool place or for 12 hours 
in a warmer place. Place the pan 
on the cooler part of the stove and 
heat imtil the milk is very hot, but 
not to the boiling point. If heated 
too much a thick skin will form on 
the surface. The more slowly the 
milk is heated the better. Having 
been heated, the milk should be kept 
in a cool place for 24 hours and then 
skimmed. The thick cream obtained 



has a characteristic flavor and tex- 
ture. 

CHEESE DISHES AND THEIR 
PEEPARATION 

The list of cheese dishes in the culi- 
nary literature of this and other 
countries is a long one, but most of 
them are variations of a compara- 
tively small nmnber of general types. 
Those which have been selected and 
studied experimentally represent the 
principal types and in many cases 
have been adapted to American 
methods of preparations and tastes. 
In some instances, this has resulted in 
new and perhaps more rational com- 
binations than those which served as 
models. 

For convenience, the cheese dishes 
included in this bulletin have been 
grouped under the following heads: 

(1) Cheese dishes which may serve 
as meat substitutes. 

(2) Cheese soups and vegetables 
cooked with cheese. 

(3) Cheese salads, sandwiches, and 
similar dishes. 

(4) Cheese pastry, cheese sweets, 
and similar dishes. 

Variety may be obtained in the 
recipes by varying the flavorings. 
Among the best flavorings for cheese 
dishes are onion, chives, and the or- 
dinary green sweet pepper. Since 
the cheese needs very little cooking, 
however, and onion or the pepper 
needs a great deal, they should al- 
ways be previously cooked, either by 
stewing in a very little water, or by 
cooking in butter. The seeds of the 
pepper, of course, should be removed 
before cooking. Where chopped cel- 
ery is used, as it may be in most of 
these dishes, it, too, should be cooked 
beforehand until tender. Other good 
flavors are mustard, curry powder, 
onion juice, chopped olives, pimiento, 
and, according to European recipes, 
nutmeg or mace. 

In preparing the cheese it often 
has been found convenient to use a 
very coarse grater, having silts in- 
stead of the usual rounded holes. 
Such a grater, in spite of its name, 
shaves the cheese instead of grating

it. When the cheese is soft this is 
an advantage, since the grater does 
not become clogged. 

CHEESE DISHES WHICH MAY BE 
USED IN THE SAME WAY AS 
MEAT 

Meat is wholesome and relished by 
most persons, yet it is not essential 
to a well-balanced meal and there 
are many housekeepers who for one 
reason or another are interested in 
lessening the amount of meat which 
they provide or to substitute some 
other foods for it. The problem with 
the average family is undoubtedly 
more often the occasional substitu- 
tion of other palatable dishes for the 
sake of variety, for reasons of econ- 
omy, or for some other reason than 
the general replacement of meat 
dishes by other things. 

Foods which are to be served in 
place of meat should be rich in pro- 
tein and fat and should also be sa- 
vory. Cheese naturally suggests it- 
self as a substitute for meat, since it 
is rich in the same kinds of nutri- 
ents which meat supplies, is a staple 
food with which every one is familiar, 
and is one which can be used in a 
great variety of ways. In substitut- 
ing cheese for meat, especial pains 
should be taken to serve dishes which 
are relished by the members of the 
family. A number of recipes for 
dishes which contain cheese are given 
below. They are preceded by several 
recipes for cheese sauces which, as 
will appear, are called for in the 
preparation of some of the more 
substantial dishes. 

Cheese Sauce No. I. 

1 cupful of milk, 

2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 

1 ounce of cheese (^ cupful of 

grated cheese). 
Salt and pepper. 

Thicken the milk with the flour and 
just before serving add the cheese, 
stirring until it is melted. 

This sauce is suitable for use in 
preparing creamed eggs, or to pour 
over toast, making a dish correspond- 



ing to ordinary milk toast, ex- 
cept for the i^resence of cheese. It 
may be seasoned with a little curry 
powder and poured over hard boiled 

eggs. 

Cheese Sauce No. II, 

Same as cheese sauce No. I, except 
that the cheese is increased from 1 
to 2 ounces. 

This sauce is suitable for using 
with macaroni or rice, or for baking 
with crackers soaked in milk. 

Cheese Sauce No. III. 

Same as cheese sauce No. I, except 
that two cupfuls of grated cheese or 
8 ounces are used. This may be used 
upon toast as a substitute for Welsh 
rarebit. 

Cheese Sauce No. IV. 

Same as cheese sauce No. II, save 
that 2 tablespoonfuls of melted but- 
ter are mixed with the flour before 
the latter is put into the milk. This 
sauce is therefore very rich in fat 
and has only a mild flavor of cheese. 

Among the recipes for dishes which 
may be used like meat, the first 30 
are such that, eaten in usual quanti- 
ties, they will provide much the same 
kind and amount of nutritive mate- 
rial as the ordinary servings of meat 
dishes used at dinner. In several 
cases there is a resemblance in ap- 
pearance and flavor to common meat 
dishes, which would doubtless be a 
point in their favor with many fam- 
ilies. 

^\^lile, chiefly owing to custom, it 
may not accord with the taste of the 
family to serve cheese dishes at din- 
ner in place of meat, it is much more 
in accord with usual dietary habits 
in American homes to serve such 
dishes at least occasionally for 
lunch, for supper, or for breakfast; 
that is, for a less formal meal than 
dinner. The last group of recipes in 
this section, beginning with " break- 
fast cereals with cheese," supply 
rather smaller proportions of nutri- 
tive materials than those in the first 
group and so may be more suitable 
for use at the less hearty meals. 
There is no hard and fast line to be 



200 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



drawn between the two groups, how- 
ever, and many of the recipes may be 
used interchangeably. 

In the recipes calling for large 
amounts of cheese the food value is 
given, not in figures, but in compari- 
son with beef of average composition 
and average percentage of waste. 
This comparison is necessarily rough 
owing to the varying composition of 
the foods and the varying weights of 
such ingredients as a cupful of grated 
cheese or bread crumbs. In making 
the comparisons, beef of average 
composition has been considered to 
have 15.5 per cent of protein, and a 
fuel value of 935 calories per pound; 
ordinary American cheese has been 
considered to have 26 per cent of 
protein and a fuel value of 1,965 cal- 
ories per pound. After many weigh- 
ings, 4 ounces was decided to be the 
average weight of a cupful of cheese 
and 2i ounces the average weight 
of a cupful of bread crumbs. These 
weights have been taken, therefore, 
in calculating the food value of 
dishes. When cheese is very soft, 
however, it may be pressed into a 
cup and measured like butter. Under 
these circumstances, the weight of a 
cupful of cheese may be considered 
one-half a pound. The price of 
cheese is taken as 22 cents a pound, 
of butter -25 cents a pound, of eggs 
25 cents a dozen, in this and all simi- 
lar calculations in this bulletin. 
Prices vary with time, place, and sea- 
son. Those mentioned above are such 
as were paid for materials at the time 
the experiments here summarized 
were made and are not extreme values 
in either direction. Like all such es- 
timates, the calculations are only rela- 
tive, and the housekeeper who wishes 
to estimate the comparative cost of 
the cheese dishes and other foods can 
readily do so by taking into account 
the amount of materials used and the 
prices paid for ingredients at any 
particular time. 

Cheese Fondue No. I. 

IJ cupsful of soft, stale bread 

crumbs, 
6 ounces of cheese (li cupsful 
of grated cheese or IJ cups- 



ful of cheese grated fine or 
cut into small pieces), 

4 eggs, 

1 cupful of hot water, 

i teaspoonful of salt. 

Mix the water, bread crumbs, salt 
and cheese; add the yolks thoroughly 
beaten; in this mixture cut and fold 
the whites of eggs beaten until stiff. 
Pour into a buttered baking dish and 
cook 30 minutes in a moderate oven. 
Serve at once. 

The food value of this dish, made 
with the above quantities, is almost 
exactly the same as that of a pound 
of beef of average composition and a 
pound of potatoes combined. It con- 
tains about 80 grams of proteids and 
has a fuel value of about 1,300 cal- 
ories. Estimated cost, 18 cents, cal- 
culated as explained elsewhere. 

Cheese Fondue No. II. 

IJ cupsful of hot milk, 

Ih cupsful of soft, stale bread 
crumbs, 

1 tablespoonful of butter, 

4 eggs, 

i of a pound of cheese (li cups- 
ful of grated cheese or 1 cup- 
ful of cheese cut into small 
pieces), 

i teaspoonful of salt. 

Prepare as in previous recipe. 

The protein value of this dish is 
equal to that of IJ pounds of po- 
tato and beef, the fuel value, however, 
being much in excess of these. Cal- 
culated cost, 22 cents. 

In making either of these fondues, 
rice or other cereals may be sub- 
stituted for bread crumbs. One- 
fourth cupful of rice measured be- 
fore cooking, or one cupful of cooked 
rice or other cereals, should be 
used. 

A comparison of the reci]ies for the 
two fondues may indicate the general 
principle on which the recipes in this 
bulletin have been worked out. The 
second recipe is one commonly found 
in cookbooks. In the first one, the 
butter has been omitted and water 
substituted for milk and the amoimt 



CHEESE AND ITS ECONOMICAL USES 



201 



of cheese is slightly increased. This 
makes a somewhat cheaper dish and 
one which is less rich because its per- 
centage of fat is not so great. 
For this reason it is easier to adjust 
to the ordinary bill of fare. A dish 
in which there is combined cheese 
with its large percentage of fat, but- 
ter with its 85 per cent of fat, and 
eggs with their 10 per cent of fat, is 
too rich to admit of being combined 
rationally with other fatty dishes. It 
therefore limits the number of dishes 
that may be served with it, making 
milk SOU}), for example, or dishes con- 
taining white sauce or those contain- 
ing much butter or oil seem out of 
place. The omission of butter from 
the ordinary recipes and the substitu- 
tion of water or skimmed milk for 
whole milk may perhaps be the means 
of making cheese dishes more whole- 
some and more generally accept- 
able. 

Another advantage of omitting 
butter from cheese dishes and of sub- 
stituting water or skimmed milk for 
whole milk is that it makes it possi- 
ble to increase the amount of cheese 
without making the dish too rich. 
This is of advantage to those who 
like the flavor of cheese, and also, be- 
cause it tends to increase the tissue 
forming value of the dish, particu- 
larly if skimmed milk is used rather 
than water. 

Boiled Fondue. 

li cupsful of bread crumbs, 
li cupsful of milk, 
1^ cupsful of cheese cut into 
small pieces, 

1 egg. 

2 tablespoonsful of butter, 
6 ounces of crackers. 

Soak the bread in the milk. Melt 
the butter and add the cheese. When 
the cheese has melted add the soaked 
crumbs, the eggs slightly beaten, and 
the seasoning. Cook a short time and 
serve on toasted crackers. 

Since it consists of essentially the 
same ingredients, the food value of 
this dish is obviously much the same 
as that of fondue made in other 
ways. 



Rice Fondue. 

1 cupful of boiled rice, 

2 tablespoonsful of milk, 
4 eggs, 

1 cupful of grated cheese, 

i teaspoonful of salt, 

1 teaspoonful of some commer- 
cial meat sauce, or similar fla- 
voring. 

Heat the rice in the milk, add the 
other ingredients, and cook slowly 
until the cheese is melted. Serve on 
crackers or toast. 

The food value is not far from that 
of a pound of beef of average com- 
position, and the calculated cost is 15 
cents. 

Corn and Cheese Souffle. 

1 tablespoonful of butter, 

1 tablespoonful of chopped green 
pepper, 

i cupful of flour, 

2 cupsful of milk, 

1 cupful of chopped corn, 
1 cupful of grated cheese, 

* teaspoonful of salt. 

JNIelt the butter and cook the pep- 
per thoroughly in it. Make a sauce 
out of the flour, milk, and cheese 
as explained elsewhere; add the corn, 
cheese, yolks, and seasoning; cut and 
fold in the whites beaten stiffly; turn 
into a buttered baking dish and bake 
in a moderate oven 30 minutes. 

Made with skimmed milk and with- 
out butter, this dish has a food value 
slightly in excess of a pound of beef 
and a pound of potatoes. Calcu- 
lated cost about 20 cents. 

Welsh Rabbit. 

1 tablespoonful of butter, 

1 teaspoonful of cornstarch, 

i cupful of milk, 

A pound of cheese, cut into small 

pieces, 
I teaspoonful each of salt and 

mustard, 
A speck of cayenne pepper. 

Cook the cornstarch in the butter; 
then add the milk gradually and cook 
two minutes; add the cheese and stir 



202

until it is melted. Season and serve 
on crackers or bread toasted on one 
side, the rabbit being poured over 
the untoasted side. Food value is 
that of about | of a pound of beef. 
Calculated cost, 13 cents. 

Tomato Rabbit. 

2 tablespoonsful of butter, 

2 tablespoonsful of flour, 

f cupful of milk, 

I cupful of stewed and strained 

tomatoes, 
i teaspoonful of soda, 

1 pound of cheese, 

2 eggs, slightly beaten. 

Salt, mustard, cayenne pepper. 

Cook the -butter and the flour to- 
gether, add the milk, and as soon as 
the mixture thickens add tomatoes 
and soda. Then add cheese, eggs, and 
seasoning. Serve on toasted whole 
wheat or Graham bread. 

Green Corn, Tomato, and Cheese. 

1 tablespoonful of butter, 

2 cups of grated cheese, 

I cup of canned or grated fresh 
corn, 

1 ripe pimiento, 

i cup of tomato pur^e, 

2 egg yolks, 

1 teaspoonful of salt, 
i teaspoonful of paprika, 
1 clove of garlic, 
4 slices of bread, 

Into the melted butter stir the 
cheese until it, too, is melted. Then 
add the corn and pimiento, stir for a 
moment and add the egg yolks beaten 
and mixed with the tomato juice 
and the salt and paprika. Have 
ready the bread toasted on one side 
and very lightly rubbed on its un- 
toasted side with the garlic cut in two. 
Pour the mixture over the untoasted 
side of the bread and serve at once, 
A poached egg is sometimes placed on 
top of each portion, making a very 
nutritious combination. 

Macaroni and Cheese No. I. 

1 cupful of macaroni, broken into 
small pieces, 

2 quarts of boiling water. 



1 cupful of milk. 

2 tablespoonsful of flour, 
^ to A pound of cheese, 

i teaspoonful of salt. 
Speck of cayenne pepper. 

Cook the macaroni in the boiling 
salted water, drain in a strainer, and 
pour cold water over it to prevent 
the pieces from adhering to each 
other. Make a sauce out of the flour, 
milk, and cheese. Put the sauce 
and macaroni in alternate layers in 
a buttered baking dish, cover with 
buttered crumbs, and heat in oven un- 
til crumbs are brown. 

Macaroni and Cheese No. II. 

A good way to prepare macaroni 
and cheese is to make a rich cheese 
sauce and heat the macaroni in it. 
The mixture is usuallj^ covered 
with buttered crumbs and browned 
in the oven. The advantage of 
this way of preparing the dish, 
however, is that it is unneces- 
sary to have a hot oven, as the sauce 
and macaroni may be reheated on 
the top of the stove. 

Macaroni with Cheese and Tomato 
Sauce. 

Boiled macaroni may be heated in 
tomato sauce and sprinkled with 
grated cheese just before serving. 

Italian Macaroni and Cheese. 

1 cupful of macaroni broken into 
small pieces, 

2 quarts of boiling salted water, 
i onion, 

2 cloves, 

li cupsful of tomato sauce, 
^ cupful or more of grated 
cheese. 

Cook the macaroni in the boiling 
salted water with the onion and 
cloves. Drain, remove the onion and 
cloves, reheat in tomato sauce, and 
serve with grated cheese. 

Cheese and Macaroni Loaf. 

J cupful of macaroni broken into

1 cupful of soft bread crumbs, 

1 tablespoonful of butter, 

1 tablespoonful of chopped green 

pepper, 
1 teaspoonful each of chopped 

onion and parsley, 

3 eggs, 

1 teaspoonful of salt, 

i cupful of grated cheese, 

Cook the macaroni in boiling salted 
water until tender, and rinse in cold 
water. Cook the parsley, onion, and 
pepper in a little water with the but- 
ter. Pour off the water or allow it 
to boil away. Beat the egg, white 
and yolk separately. Mix all the in- 
gredients, cutting and folding in the 
stiffly beaten whites at the last. Line 
a quart baking dish with buttered pa- 
per; turn the mixture into it; set 
the baking dish in a pan of hot water, 
and bake in a moderate oven from 
one-half to three-fourths of an hour. 
Serve with tomato sauce. 

Baked Rice and Cheese No. I. 

1 cupful of uncooked rice and 

4 cupsful of milk; 

or, 
3 cupsful of cooked rice and 

1 cupful of milk, 

2 tablespoonsful of flour, 
I pound of cheese, 

i teaspoonful of salt. 

If uncooked rice is used, it should 
be cooked in 3 cupsful of milk. 
Make a sauce with one cupful of 
milk, add the flour, cheese, and salt. 
Into a buttered baking dish put 
alternate layers of the cooked rice 
and the sauce. Cover with but- 
tered crumbs and bake until the 
crumbs are brown. The proteids in 
this dish, made with rice cooked in 
milk, are equal to those of nearly 
1| pounds of average beef. If 
skimmed milk is used, the fuel value 
is equal to nearly 3i pounds of beef. 
Whole milk raises the fuel value still 
higher. Estimated cost 28 cents. 

Baked Rice and Cheese No. II. 

i pound of cheese grated or cut 

into small pieces, 
1 cupful of rice. 
Milk as needed. 



Cook the rice; put into a buttered 
baking dish alternate layers of rice 
and cheese; pour over them enough 
milk thoroughly to soak the cheese and 
the rice; cover with buttered crumbs 
and brown. 

If the rice is cooked in milk either 
whole or skimmed, and one cup of 
milk is used to pour over it, this 
dish has as much protein as 1^ 
pounds of beef of average composi- 
tion and a much higher fuel value. 

Baked Crackers and Cheese No. I. 

9 or 10 butter crackers or Bos- 
ton crackers, 

i pound of cheese or 1 cupful of 
grated cheese, 

li cupsful of milk, 

i teaspoonful salt, 

Flour. 

Split the crackers, if the thick sort 
are selected, or with a sharp knife 
cut them into pieces of uniform size. 
Pour the milk over them and drain 
it off at once. With the milk, flour, 
cheese, and salt, make a sauce. Into 
a buttered baking dish put alternate 
layers of the soaked crackers and 
sauce. Cover with bread crumbs and 
brown in the oven, or simply reheat 
without covering with crumbs. 

The above is a very satisfactory 
substitute for macaroni and cheese, 
and can be prepared in less time. 

Baked Crackers and Cheese No. II. 
9 or 10 butter crackers or soda 

crackers, 
9 cupsful of hot milk, whole or 

skimmed, 
1 cupful of grated cheese, 
i teaspoonful of salt. 

This is more quickly prepared than 
the preceding recipe, but as the milk 
is likely to curdle, it has not so good 
a consistency. 

Soak the crackers in the milk; 
place them in a buttered baking dish 
in alternate la5'ers with the cheese; 
pour the remaining milk over them 
and bake. This dish may be covered 
with buttered crumbs. Variety may 
be secured, in either this recipe or the 
preceding one, by putting a very 



204

small amount of mixed mustard on 
each cracker. 

Cheese Bolls. 

A large variety of rolls may be 
made by combining legumes, either 
beans of various kinds, cowpeas, len- 
tils, or peas, with cheese of various 
kinds, and adding bread crumbs to 
make the mixture thick enough to 
form into a roll. Beans are usually 
mashed, but peas or small Lima 
beans may be combined whole with 
bread crumbs and grated cheese, and 
enough of the liquor in which the 
vegetables have been cooked may be 
added to get the right consistency. 
Or, instead of beans or peas, chopped 
spinach, beet tops, or head lettuce 
may be used. Home-made cottage 
cheese, and the soft cream cheese of 
commerce, standard cheese, or Eng- 
lish dairy may be used. 

Boston Eoast. 

1 pound can of kidney beans or 
equivalent quantity of cooked 
beans, 

J pound of grated cheese, 

Bread crumbs, 

Salt. 

Mash the beans or put them 
through a meat grinder. Add the 
cheese and suiBcient bread crumbs to 
make the mixture stiff enough to be 
formed into a roll. Bake in a mod- 
erate oven, basting occasionally with 
butter and water. Serve with toma- 
to sauce. This dish may be flavored 
with onions, chopped and cooked in 
butter and water. 

Pimiento and Cheese Roast. 

2 cupsful of cooked Lima beans, 
i pound of cream cheese, com- 
mercial or home made, 

3 canned pimientos chopped, 
Bread crumbs. 

Put the first three ingredients 
through a meat chopper. Mix thor- 
oughly and add bread crumbs until 
it is stiff enough to form into a roll. 
Brown in the oven, basting occa- 
sionally with butter and water. 



Nut and Cheese Eoast. 

1 cujjful of grated cheese, 
1 cupful of chopped English 
walnuts, 

1 cupful of bread crumbs, 

2 tablespoonsful of chopped on- 
ion, 

1 tablespoonful of butter. 
Juice of half a lemon. 
Salt and pepper. 

Cook the onion in the butter and 
a little water until it is tender. Mix 
the other ingredients and moisten 
with water, using the water in which 
the onion has been cooked. Pour into 
a shallow baking dish and brown in 
the oven. 

Cheese and Spinach Eoll. 

2 quarts of spinach, 

1 cupful of grated cheese, 

1 tablespoonful of butter, 

Salt, 

Bread crumbs. 

Cook the spinach in water for 10 
minutes. Drain off the water, add 
the butter, cook until tender, and 
chop. Add the cheese and the eggs, 
and bread crumbs enough to make 
a mixture sufficiently stiff' to form 
into a roll, or leave more moist and 
cook in a baking dish. 

Vegetable and Cheese EoUs. 

For the spinach of the above rec- 
ipe there may be substituted beet 
tops, Swiss chard, or the outer 
leaves of lettuce. 

Cheese Used in the Stuffing of Meats. 
The mixtures in the preceding two 
recipes may be used for stuffing veal 
or beef. Eggs may be added if de- 
sired, and chopped onions or parsley 
may be cooked with the greens. In 
Italy roasts thus prepared are sprin- 
kled with a little finely chopped gar- 
lic, and covered with celery tops and 
thin slices of bacon or fat pork be- 
fore roasting. 

Creamed Cheese and Eggs. 

3 hard boiled eggs, 

1 tablespoonful of flour, 
1 cupful of milk. 



CHEESE AND ITS ECONOMICAL USES 



205 



i teaspoonful of salt, 

Speck of cayenne, 

I cupful or 1 ounce grated 

cheese, 
4 slices of toast. 

Make a thin white sauce with the 
flour and milk and seasonings. Add 
the cheese and stir until melted. 
Chop the whites and add them to the 
sauce. Pour the sauce over the toast, 
force the yolks through a potato 
ricer or strainer, sprinkle over the 
toast. 

Baked Eggs with Cheese. 
4 eggs, 
1 cupful, or 4 ounces, of grated 

cheese, 
1 cupful of fine, soft, stale 

bread crumbs, 
I teaspoonful salt, 
A few grains of cayenne pepper. 

Break the eggs into a buttered bak- 
ing dish or into ramequins and cook 
them in a hot oven until they begin 
to turn white around the edge. Cover 
with the mixture of crumbs, cheese, 
and seasonings. Brown in a very hot 
oven. In preparing this dish it is 
essential that the oven be very hot 
or the egg will be too much cooked 
by the time the cheese is brown. To 
avoid this, some cooks cover the eggs 
with white sauce before adding 
crumbs. 

The food value of the dish is very 
close to that of a pound of beef of 
average composition. The estimated 
cost is about 14 cents. 

For those who are particularly 
fond of cheese the amount of cheese 
in this recipe may be very much in- 
creased, thus making a much more 
nourishing dish. Or, the amount may 
be reduced so as to give hardly more 
than a suggestion of the flavor of 
cheese. 

Scrambled Eggs with Cheese. 

i pound of cheese grated or cut 

into small pieces, 
8 eggs, 
1 tablespoon ful of chopped 

parsley, 
A pinch of nutmeg, 
i teaspoonful of salt. 



Beat the eggs slightly, mix them 
with the other ingredients, and cook 
over a very slow fire, stirring con- 
stantly, so that the cheese may be 
melted by the time the eggs are 
cooked. In food value the dish is 
equal to nearly 2 pounds of average 
beef. The calculated cost is about 30 
cents. 

Swiss Eggs. 
4 eggs, 

i cupful of cream, 
1 tablespoonful of butter. 
Salt and pepper, 
i cupful of grated cheese. 

Heat the butter and cream to- 
gether, break in the eggs whole, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. When 
nearly done, add the cheese. Serve 
on buttered toast. Strain the cream 
over the toast. 

Cheese Omelet No. I. 

Cheese may be introduced into 
omelets in several ways. An ordin- 
ary omelet may be served with thin 
cheese sauce made in the following 
proportions: 

li tablespoonsful of flour, 
li tablespoonsful of cheese, 

1 cupful of milk. 

This sauce may also be added to 
omelets in which boiled rice, minced 
meat, or some other nutritious ma- 
terial has been included. 

Cheese Omelet No. II. 

Grated cheese may be sprinkled 
over an ordinary omelet before it is 
served. 

Cheese Omelet. 

Yolks of 2 eggs, 

2 tablespoonsful of hot water, 
1 cupful of grated cheese, 
Salt and pepper. 

Whites of 4 eggs, 

1 tablespoonful of butter. 

Beat the yolks until lemon colored 
and add the hot water and the sea- 
soning. Beat the whites until they 
are stiff, and add the cheese. Cut 
and fold the two mixtures together.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Heat the butter in omelet pan and 
cook the mixture very slowly until it 
is brown on the underside. If pos- 
sible, cook the top of the omelet in 
the oven or by means of a hot plate 
held over it. 

Breakfast Cereals with Cheese. 

That cheese combined with cereal 
foods makes a rational dish as re- 
gards the jDroportion of nutrients it 
supplies has been pointed out on an- 
other page. Cheese and some of the 
crisp " ready to serve " cereal break- 
fast foods is a combination which is 
common, the cheese being melted with 
the cereal food, or simply served 
with it. 

There are many who relish a piece 
of cheese with the cooked cereal so 
commonly eaten for breakfast and 
find such a combination satisfying to 
appetite and taste. Oatmeal or some 
other home cooked breakfast cereal 
prepared with cheese is palatable, 
and such dishes have an advantage 
in that they may be served without 
cream and sugar. Since such a dish 
contains considerably more protein 
than the breakfast cereals as or- 
dinarily served, it has a further ad- 
vantage in that it may well serve 
as the principal item of a breakfast 
menu, instead of a preliminary to 
other courses. Such a combination 
as cereals cooked with cheese, toast, 
fruit, and tea, coffee, or chocolate, 
makes a palatable as well as nutri- 
tious breakfast and one which does 
not require much work to prepare 
and to clear away. A recipe for pre- 
paring oatmeal with cheese follows. 
Wheat breakfast foods, either parched 
or unparched, corn meal, and hominy 
may be prepared in the same way. 

Oatmeal with Cheese. 
2 cupsful of oatmeal, 
1 cupful of grated cheese, 
1 tablespoonful of butter, 
1 level teaspoonful of salt. 

Cook the oatmeal as usual. Shortly 
before serving, stir in the butter and 
add the cheese, and stir until the 
cheese is melted and thoroughly 
blended with the cereal. 



The cheese should be mild in flavor 
and soft in texture. The proportion 
of cheese used may be increased if a 
more pronounced cheese flavor is de- 
sired. 

Cheese with Mush. 

Cheese may be added to cornmeal 
nuish or to nmsh made from any of 
the corn or wheat preparations now 
on the market. The addition of 
cheese to cornmeal mush is particu- 
larly desirable when the mush is to 
be fried. 

Fried Bread with Cheese No. I. 
6 slices of bread, 

1 cupful of milk, 

2 ounces of cheese, or i cup- 
ful of grated cheese, 

i teaspoonful of salt, 
2 teaspoonful of potassium bi- 
carbonate, 
Butter or other fat for frying. 

Scald the milk with the potassium 
bicarbonate; add the grated cheese, 
and stir until it dissolves. Dip the 
bread in this mixture and fry it in 
the butter. The potassium bicar- 
bonate helps to keep the cheese in 
solution. It is desirable, however, 
to keep the milk hot while the bread 
is being dipped. 

Fried Bread with Cheese No. II. 

Cut stale bread into thin pieces. 
Put two pieces together with grated 
cheese between them; dip into a mix- 
ture of egg and milk and fry in but- 
ter or other fat. 

Roman Gnocchl, 

2 cupsful of milk, 
i cupful of flour, 

1 cupful of cornstarch, 

2 cupsful of milk, 

2 egg yolks, 

3 cujiful of grated cheese, 
Salt. 

Melt the butter; cook the corn- 
starch thoroughly, and then the flour 
in the butter; add the milk gradu- 
ally; cook three minutes, stirring con- 
stantly; add the yolks and one-half 
cupful of the cheese. Pour into a

buttered shallow pan and cool. Cut 
into squares; place them on a plat- 
ter a little distance apart; sprinkle 
with remaining cheese, and brown in 
the oven. 

The proteid value is that of three- 
fourths of a pound of average beef, 
the fuel value that of 1| pounds. 
Calculated cost 17 cents. 

Cheese Souffle. 

2 tablespoonsful of butter, 

3 tablesiJoonsful of flour, 

i cupful of milk (scalded), 

i teaspoonful of salt, 

A speck of cayenne, 

i cupful of grated cheese, 

3 eggs. 

Melt the butter; add the flour and, 
when well mixed, add gradually the 
scalded milk. Then add salt, cay- 
enne, and cheese. Remove from the 
fire and ,add the yolks of the eggs, 
beaten until lemon colored. Cool 
the mixture and fold into it the 
whites of the eggs, beaten until stiff. 
Pour into a buttered baking dish and 
cook 20 minutes in a slow oven. 
Serve at once. 

The proteid value of this recipe is 
equal to that of a half pound of beef; 
the fuel value is equal to that of 
three-fourths of a pound. 

Cheese Souffle with Pastry. 

2 eggs, 

S cupful of thin cream, 

1 cupful of grated cheese, 

i cupful of Swiss cheese cut into 

small pieces. 
Salt, cayenne pepper, and nut- 
meg. 

Add the eggs to the cream and 
beat slightly, then add the cheese and 
seasoning. Bake 15 minutes in a hot 
oven, in patty tins lined with puff 
paste. 

Cheese Croquettes. 

3 tablespoonsful of butter, 
i cupful of flour, 

I cupful of milk. 
Yolks of 2 eggs, 

1 cupful of cheese cut in very 
small pieces. 



i cupful grated cheese, 
Salt and pepper. 

Make with a white sauce, using the 
butter, flour, and the milk. Add the 
unbeaten yolks and stir until well 
mixed, then add the grated cheese. 
As soon as the cheese melts, remove 
from the fire, fold in the pieces of 
cheese, and add the seasoning. 
Spread in a shallow pan and cool. 
Cut into squares or strips, cover v/ith 
an egg and crumb mixture, and fry 
in deep fat. 

Fried Cheese Balls. 

IJ cupsful of grated cheese, 
1 tablespoonful of flour. 
The whites of 3 eggs. 
Salt, pepper, cracker dust. 

Beat the whites of the eggs; add 
the other ingredients; make into balls 
and roll in cracker dust. If the 
amount of flour is doubled, the mix- 
ture may be dropped from a spoon 
and fried without being rolled in 
crumbs. 

CHEESE SOUPS AND VEGETABLES 
COOKED WITH CHEESE 

In these dishes the cheese is used 
not only to add nutritive value, but 
also to give its characteristic flavor 
either to materials otherwise rather 
mild in taste (as in potatoes with 
cheese) or to combine its flavor with 
that of some more highly flavored 
vegetables (as in cheese and vege- 
table soup). The ingenious house- 
keeper whose family is fond of cheese 
can doubtless think of many desirable 
ways of making such combinations 
besides those given in the following 
recipes: 

llilk and Cheese Soup. 

3 cupsful of milk, or part milk 

and part stock, 
1^ tablespoonsful of flour, 
1 cupful of grated cheese. 
Salt and paprika. 

Thicken the milk with the flour, 
cooking thoroughly. This is best done 
in a double boiler, with frequent stir- 



208 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



rings. When ready to serve, add the 
cheese and the seasoning. 

The proteids in this soup are equal 
in amount to those in five-sixths of 
a pound of beef of average composi- 
tion; its fuel value is higher than that 
of a pound of beef. 

Cheese and Vegetable Soup. 
2 cupsful of stock, 
2 tablespoonsful of finely 
chopped carrots, 

1 tablespoonful of chopped onion, 
A very little mace, 

2 tablespoonsful of butter, 
2 tablespoonsful of flour, 
IJ teaspoonsful of salt, 

1 cupful of scalded milk, 
i cupful of grated cheese. 

Cook the vegetables a short time in 
one-half of the butter, add the stock 
and the mace, boiling 15 or 20 min- 
utes. Strain and add the milk. 
Thicken with flour cooked in the re- 
maining butter. Just before serving, 
stir in the cheese and cook until it is 
melted. 

Scalloped Potatoes with Cheese 
No. I. 

Put into a buttered baking dish 
alternate layers of cheese sauce Xo. 
I and cold boiled potatoes, sliced or 
cut into dice. Cover with buttered 
crumbs and bake. 

Scalloped Potatoes with Cheese 
No. II. 

Put into a buttered baking dish al- 
ternate layers of white sauce and cold 
boiled potatoes, either sliced or cut 
into dice. Put over the top a layer 
of grated cheese and then a layer of 
buttered bread crumbs. Brown in 
the oven. 

Scalloped Cabbage or Cauliflower 
with Cheese. 

Cauliflower or cabbage may be 
scalloped according to either of the 
recipes given for scalloped potatoes 
and cheese. Sometimes a cauliflower 
is boiled whole, spread with grated 
cheese, then with buttered bread 
crumbs. It is browned in the oven 
and served with white sauce poured 
around it. 



Cheese with Potato Puffs. 

1 cupful of mashed potatoes. 
i cupful of milk, 

1 egg. 

i tcaspoonful of salt, 

i cupful of grated cheese. 

Beat the potatoes and milk to- 
gether until thoroughly mixed. Add 
the egg and the salt and beat thor- 
oughly. Finally add the cheese. 
Bake in muffin tins in a slow oven 
10 or 15 minutes. 

A similar dish may be made by 
scooping out the inside of a baked 
potato and mixing it with cheese as 
above. Fill the potato-skin shell 
with the mixture, return to the oven, 
and bake until light brown. 

Potatoes with Cheese Sauce. 

Cut boiled potatoes into cubes and 
serve with cheese sauce No. I. This 
is one of the cheese and vegetable 
dishes most frequently found on 
restaurant menus. 

CHEESE SALADS, SANDWICHES, 
AND SIMILAR CHEESE DISHES 

Cheese of one sort or another is a 
very common accompaniment of sal- 
ads, and the combination is rational 
as well as palatable, for the constit- 
uents of the succulent foods — chiefly 
water and cellulose — supplement the 
protein and fat of the cheese. Cheese 
is often used also as a part of the 
salad. 

A number of recipes are given be- 
low for cheese salads and other 
cheese dishes which may be served 
with dinner or other regular meals, 
or served as part of a special lunch 
or special supper. Many of the 
cheese dishes discussed in other sec- 
tions are also commonly used for such 
occasions when something savory is 
desired which can be easily and 
quickly prepared. 

Cheese with Salads. 

Cheese or clieese dishes are an ac- 
ceptable addition to salads. Neuf- 
chStel or other cream cheese, either 
plain or mixed with pimientos and 
olives may be passed with lettuce or 



CHEESE AND ITS ECONOMICAL USES 



209 



may be cut into slices and served on 
lettuce. 

Cheese balls are often served with 
salad. They are made of some soft 
cream cheese, and are frequently com- 
bined with chopped chives, olives, 
sweet peppers, chopped nuts, etc., 
for the sake of adding flavor. 
Cooked egg yolk, spinach extract, etc., 
are sometimes mixed in for the sake 
of color. If the balls are rolled in 
chopped chives or parsley, both flavor 
and color are supplied. 

Plain Cheese Salad. 

Cut Edam or ordinary American 
cheese into thin pieces, scatter them 
over lettuce leaves, and serve with 
French dressing. 

Olive and Pimiento Sandwich or 
Salad Cheese. 

Mash any of the soft cream cheeses 
and add chopped olives and pimientos 
in equal parts. This mixture re- 
quires much salt to make it palat- 
able to most palates, the amount de- 
pending chiefly on the quantity of 
pimiento used. The mixture may be 
spread between thin slices of bread 
or it may be made into a roll or 
molded, cut into slices, and served 
on lettuce leaves with French dress- 
ing. 

Cheese and Tomato Salad. 

Stuff cold tomatoes with cream 
cheese and serve on lettuce leaves 
with French dressing. 

Cheese and Pimento Salad. 

Stufi' canned pimientos with cream 
cheese, cut into slices, and serve one 
or two slices to each person on let- 
tuce leaves with French dressing. 

Cheese Jelly Salad. 

i cupful of grated cheese, 
1 tablespoonful of gelatin, 
1 cupful of whipped cream. 
Salt and pepper to taste. 

Mix the cheese with the whipped 
cream, season to taste with salt and 
pepper, and add to the gelatin dis- 
solved in a scant cupful of water. 



This may be molded in a large mold 
or in small molds. 

When the jelly begins to harden, 
cover with grated cheese. The jelly 
should be served on a lettuce leaf, 
preferably with a cream dressing or 
a French dressing, to which a little 
grated cheese has been added. 

Cheese Salad and Preserves. 

Epicures have devised a dish which 
consists of lettuce with French dress- 
ing served with cream cheese and 
thick preparations of currants or 
other fruits preserved in honey or 
sugar, which, owing to the fact that 
the seeds have been extracted by a 
laborious process, are fairly expen- 
sive. The soft cheese often found in 
market is also relatively expensive. 
There is a suggestion in this dish, 
however, for others which are much 
less costly. Buttermilk cream, or 
ordinary cottage cheese served with 
lettuce or other green salad and 
a small amount of rich home- 
made preserves, is a combination with 
much the same character, and also 
very appetizing. 

Deviled Eggs with Cheese. 

In making deviled eggs, either to 
be eaten alone or upon lettuce leaves 
in the form of salad, a little grated 
cheese may be mixed with the yolks 
in addition to the usual salad dress- 
ing and flavorings with which the 
yolks are mixed. 

Cheese and Celery. 

Cut stalks of celery having deep 
grooves in them into pieces about i? 
inches long. Fill the grooves with 
cream cheese salted or flavored with 
chopped pimientos, and serve with 
bread and butter as a salad course 
or serve as a relish at the beginning 
of a meal. 

Although not cheese dishes, strictly 
speaking, the following salad dress- 
ings made with buttermilk cream may 
be included in this section. 

Buttermilk Salad Dressing'. 

i cupful of buttermilk cream, 
1 tablespoonful of vinegar, 



210 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



i teaspoonful of salt, 
Cayenne pepper. 

This dressing is particularly suit- 
able for serving with cucumbers. 

Buttermilk Cream Horseradish Salad 
Dressing. 

To buttermilk cream add a little 
grated horseradish and vinegar and 
salt. Serve on whole or sliced to- 
matoes. 

Cheese Sandwiches. 

Mash or grate American cheese, 
add salt, a few drops of vinegar and 
paprika, and a speck of mustard. 
Mix thoroughly and spread between 
thin slices of bread. 

Cheese and Anchovy Sandwiches. 

To the mixture mentioned in the 
preceding recipe, add a little anchovy 
essence. Sardines mashed or rubbed 
into a paste or any other fish paste 
may be used in a similar way. 

Cuban Sandwiches. 

This sandwich may be described as 
a kind of club sandwich with cheese. 
It is usually made large so that it is 
necessary to eat it with a knife and 
fork, it may be made in such pro- 
portions as to supply a large amount 
of nourishment. 

Cut the crusts from slices of bread. 
Between two slices lay first lettuce 
with a little salad dressing or salt 
on it, then a slice of soft mild cheese 
and finally thin slices of dill pickles 
or a little chopped pickle. 

Toasted Cheese Sandwiches. 

Plain bread and butter sandwiches 
with fairly thick slices of cheese put 
between the slices are frequently 
toasted, and on picnics, or at chafing 
dish suppers, are often browned in a 
pan in which bacon has just been 
fried. 

CHEESE PASTRY, CHEESE SWEETS, 
AND SIMILAR DISHES 

In the foregoing pages a large 
number of recipes have been included 
in which cheese is combined with ma- 



terials without cooking, as in salads, 
or used in cooked dishes of creamy 
or custard-like consistency, as in 
souffles and Welsh rabbit or in com- 
bination with vegetables or cereals, 
such as rice. 

There are a number of cheese 
dishes of quite different character in 
which the cheese is combined with 
dough, batter, or pastry in various 
ways, and a number of dishes in 
which cheese or cheese curd is used 
in combinations suitable for dessert. 
Such sweet dishes were once much 
more common than they are to-day, 
as reference to old cookery books 
will show, but some of them are well 
worth retaining. 

In cheese sweets, flavor and rich- 
ness are both contributed by the 
cheese. 

When cheese is used in pastry or 
dough it may serve simply as a 
flavor, as in cheese sticks or cheese 
straws, or it may wholly or in part 
replace with its fat the usual short- 
ening, as butter or other fat, and 
with its protein (casein) the pro- 
tein (albumin) of eggs. As an illus- 
tration of such a use of cheese, cheese 
gingerbread may be cited. 

Using cheese in this way is often 
an economy when eggs are scarce. 
Better results will be obtained if soft 
cheese is used which can be worked 
into the dough in much the same way 
as butter or other shortening. To 
those who like cheese the flavor which 
it imparts would be an advantage. 
However, if a very mild cheese is 
used in combination with molasses or 
spice the dish differs a little in flavor 
from one prepared in the usual way.

a small cutter, and bake. 

Cheese Biscuit No. II. 

i pound of soft cheese, 

2 cupsful of flour, 

1 cupful of water, 

4 teaspoonsful of baking powder, 

li teaspoonfuls of salt. 

Wix and sift the dry ingredients, 
then work in the cheese with a fork 
or with the fingers, and add the 
water gradually. The approximate 
amount of water has been given; it 
is impossible to give the exact amount, 
as flour differs in its capacity for tak- 
ing up moisture. Toss the dough on 
a floured board and roll out and cut 
with a biscuit cutter. Place in a but- 
tered pan and bake in a quick oven 
from 12 to 15 minutes. The biscuit 
may be sprinkled with cheese before 
being put into the oven. 

If the cheese is sufficiently soft it 
can be measured just as butter is. 
This recipe, then, would call for i 
cupful. 

Cheese Drops. 

21 tablespoonsful of milk, 
1 teaspoonful of butter, 
1^ cupsful of flour, 
i teaspoonful of salt, 

1 egg, 

2 tablespoonsful of grated Par- 
mesan cheese or dry American 
cheese. 

Heat the butter and milk to boil- 
ing point, add the flour and the salt 
and stir thoroughly. Remove from 
the fire, add the egg and cheese and 
stir until well mixed. When cold, 
drop in small pieces in deep fat 
and brown. This makes a good addi- 
tion to any clear soup or to con- 
somme. 

Cheese Wafers. 

Spread grated cheese on thin 
crackers, heat in the oven until the 
cheese is melted. Serve with soup or 
salad. 



Cheese Relish. 

Spread bread which has been toast- 
ed or fried in deep fat with grated 
cheese, or with grated cheese mixed 
with a little mustard, then heat in 
the oven until the cheese is melted. 
This may be served with salad, or as 
a relish to give flavor to some dish 
such as boiled rice or hominy, which 
has no very marked flavor. 

Cheese Straws. 

Roll out plain or puff paste until 
one-fourth of an inch thick. Spread 
one-half of it with grated cheese. 
Fold over the other half and roll out 
again. Repeat the process thi'ee or 
four times. Cut into strips and bake. 
Serve with soup or salad. 

Salad Biscuit. 

i pound of cheese, 

2 cupsful of flour, 

4 teaspoonsful of baking powder, 

IJ teaspoonsful of salt, 

1 cupful of water. 

Mix as for cheese biscuits No. I 
or No. II, depending on whether the 
cheese is hard or soft. 

Cheese Gingerbread No. I. 
1 cupful of molasses, 
4 ounces of cheese, 

1 teaspoonful of soda, 
i cupful of water, 

2 cupsful of flour, 

2 teaspoonsful of ginger, 
i teaspoonful salt. 

Heat the molasses and the cheese 
in a double boiler until the cheese is 
melted. Add the soda and stir vigor- 
ously. Mix and sift dry ingredients 
and add them to the molasses and 
cheese alternately with the water. 
Bake 15 minutes in small buttered 
tins. 

Cheese Gingerbread No. II. 

i cupful of molasses, 

1 cupful of sugar, 
4 ounces of cheese, 

2 cupsful of flour, 

1 teaspoonful of sodn, 

2 teaspoonsful of ginger, 



21«

i teaspoonful of salt, 
I cupful of water. 

Rub the cheese and the sugar to- 
gether. Add the molasses. Mix and 
sift the dry ingredients and add them 
to the ciicese mixture alternately 
with the water. 

Cheese Custard. 

1 cupful of grated cheese, 

i cupful of cream or rich milk, 

Yolks of 2 eggs, 

A speck of salt and of paprika. 

Mix the cream and the cheese and 
heat until the cheese is melted. Re- 
move from the fire and add the yolks 
of the eggs. Bake in paper cases or 
buttered ramequins. Serve with jelly 
or preserves. 

Cheese Cakes. 

1 quart of milk, 
Rennet, 

1 ounce of sugar, 
Yolks of 2 eggs, 
A speck of nutmeg, 
li ounces of butter, 
1 ounce of dried currants or 
small raisins. 

Warm the milk and add the ren- 
net, using the amoimt prescribed on 



the package. Let the milk stand un- 
til the curd forms, then break up the 
curd and strain off the whey. Add 
the other ingredients to the curd; line 
patty tins with pastry, fill them with 
the mixture, and bake. 

Brown Betty with Cheese. 

Arrange in a deep earthenware 
baking dish, alternate layers of bread 
crumbs and thinly sliced apples. Sea- 
son with cinnamon, also a little clove 
if desired and brown sugar. Scatter 
some finely shaved mild full cream 
cheese over each layer of apple. 
When the dish is full, scatter bread 
crumbs over the top and bake 30 to 
45 minutes, placing the dish in a pan 
of water so that the pudding will 
not burn. 

If preferred, this may be sweet- 
ened with molasses mixed with an 
equal amount of hot water and 
poured over the top, a half cupful 
of molasses being suflBcient for a 
quart pudding dish full. 

Cheese may be used in place of 
butter in a similar way in other apple 
puddings. Apple pie made with a 
layer of finely shaved cheese over 
the seasoned apple and baked in the 
usual way is liked by many who are 
fond of cheese served with apple 
pie.

PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES FOR 
THE TABLE ' 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES — SUCCULENT VEGETABLES — PEAS — 
BEANS — POTATOES — OTHER ROOTS AND BULBS — MIS- 
CELLANEOUS VEGETABLES 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

Vegetables are baked, roasted, 
fried, or boiled, are used for making 
a great variety of dishes, and are 
prepared for the table in other ways; 
but the most common method of 
cooking them is in boiling water. 
Steaming is not infrequently resorted 
to as a method of cooking vegetables 
and is, of course, similar in principle 
to boiling in water. 

The simpler the methods of cook- 
ing and serving vegetables the bet- 
ter. A properly grown and well- 
cooked vegetable wiU be palatable 
and readily digestible. Badly cooked, 
water-soaked vegetables very gener- 
ally cause digestive disturbances, 
which are often serious. Nearly 
every vegetable may be cooked so 
that with plain bread it may form a 
palatable course by itself, if it is de- 
sired to serve it in this manner. 

All green vegetables, roots, and tu- 
bers should be crisp and firm when 
put on to cook. If for any reason a 
vegetable has lost its firmness and 
crispness, it should be soaked in very 
cold water until it becomes plump 
and crisp. With new vegetables this 
will be only a matter of minutes, 
while old roots and tubers often re- 
quire many hours. All vegetables 
should be thoroughly cleaned just be- 
fore being put on to cook. Vege-

ers' Bulletin No. 266.

tables that form in heads, such as 
cabbage, cauliflower, and Brussels 
sprouts, should be soaked, heads 
turned down, in salted cold water, to 
which a few spoonsful of vinegar 
may be added. If there are any 
worms or other forms of animal life 
in these vegetables, they will crawl 
out. To secure the best results all 
vegetables except the dried legumes 
must be put in boiling water, and the 
water must be made to boil again as 
soon as possible after the vegetables 
have been added, and must be kept 
boiling until the cooking is finished. 
Herbaceous vegetables should boil 
rapidly all the time. With tubers, 
roots, cauliflowers, etc., the ebullition 
should not be so violent as to break 
the vegetables. Green beans and peas 
when removed from the pod must 
also be cooked gently, i.e., just sim- 
mer. When the pods and all are used 
they are to be cooked rapidly, like 
the herbaceous vegetables. 

To secure the most appetizing and 
palatable dishes, only fresh tender 
vegetables should be cooked. If, 
however, green beans, peas, etc., have 
grown until a little too old and it 
still seems best to gather them, a 
very small piece of baking soda add- 
ed to the water in which they are 
boiled makes them more tender, it is 
commonly believed, and helps to re- 
tain the color. Too much soda in- 
jures the flavor, and an excess must 
be carefully avoided. A little soda 



214 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



may also be used to advantage if the 
water is quite hard. Peas may be 
boiled for fifteen or twenty minutes 
in the water to which the soda has 
been added, then to be cooked the 
same as peas with pork. 

During the cooking of all vegeta- 
bles the cover must be drawn to one 
side of the stewpan to allow the vola- 
tile bodies liberated by the heat to 
pass off in the steam. All vegetables 
should be thoroughly cooked, but the 
cooking should stop while the vegeta- 
ble is still firm. This, of course, does 
not apply to vegetables that are 
cooked in soups, purees (thick 
strained soups), etc. The best sea- 
soning for most vegetables is salt and 
good butter. Vegetables that are 
blanched and then cooked with butter 
and other seasonings and very little 
moisture are more savory and nutri- 
tious than when all the cooking is 
done in a good deal of clear water. 

Blanching Vegetables. — Blanching, 
which in cookery is entirely different 
from the bleaching or blanching of 
green vegetables in the garden, is a 
cooking process often used with veg- 
etables, since it removes the strong 
or acrid taste and improves the qual- 
ity. It is also convenient, since 
blanching may be done at any time, 
and the cooking completed in a very 
short time when the dish is to be 
served. 

Have a large stewpan half full of 
rapidly boiling water. Add a table- 
spoonful of salt for every 2 quarts of 
water. Have the vegetables cleaned 
and well drained. Drop them into 
the boiling water, and bring the 
water back to the boiling point as 
quickly as possible. Boil rapidly, 
with the cover partially or wholly 
off the stewpan, five to twenty min- 
utes, depending upon the vegetable, 
then drain off the water. If the 
cooking of the vegetable is not to be 
finished at once, pour cold water 
over the vegetable to cool it quickly, 
then drain and set aside until needed. 
If the cooking is to be continued at 
once, it will not be necessary to rinse 
the vegetable with cold water. To 
complete the cooking the vesetable 
should be put in a small stewpan 



with butter or drippings and the 
other seasonings and cooked gently 
until done. A few spoonfuls of 
liquid will be required for every 
quart of very juicy vegetables, and 
half a pint of liquid for drier veg- 
etables. The stewpan is to be cov- 
ered, only a slight opening being 
left for ventilation. All vegetables 
cooked in this manner should be cut 
up rather small either before or after 
the blaching. 

Waste in Preparing Vegetables. — 
In preparing vegetables for the table 
there is almost always a larger or 
smaller loss due to inedible matter, 
skins, roots, seeds, etc., and also a 
waste of good material, which is 
caused by careless paring, etc., all 
these losses being groujied together 
in reporting analyses under the name 
" refuse." The amount of refuse var- 
ies greatly in different vegetables. 
The amount may be very small (7 
per cent) in such vegetables as string 
beans; medium (10 per cent to 15 
per cent) in such vegetables as on- 
ions, cabbage, leeks, lettuce, cucum- 
bers; or high (50 per cent) in such 
vegetables as beans in pod, pumpkins, 
and squash. With tubers, such as po- 
tatoes, the average amount of refuse 
is 20 jier cent, and with such roots 
as turnips, 30 per cent. 

In preparing vegetables for the 
table the careful cook will remove 
all inedible portions and will see to 
it that the total amount of refuse 
is as small as is consistent with good 
quality. Thin paring of potatoes and 
other vegetables is an economy which 
it is worth while to practice, and is an 
easy way of decreasing useless loss. 



Changes that Take Place in Cook- 
ing Vegetables. — Briefly, these are 
the principal changes that take place 
in vegetables during cooking: The 
cellular tissue is softened and loos- 
ened; the nitrogenous substances are 
coagulated; the starch granules ab- 
sorb moisture, swell, and burst; and 
flavors and odors are developed. 

As long as the vegetable is kept 
at a temperature above 125° F. 
changes continue to go on in the vege- 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES FOR TABLE 215 



table substance. The most marked of 
these are in the starch and in the 
odor, color, and flavor of the vege- 
table. Starch will not dissolve in cold 
water, but pure starch gelatinizes 
readily in hot water, and if the tem- 
perature is high enough will become 
gummy and opaque. If starch is 
cooked in just moisture enough to 
swell and burst its granules and is 
then kept hot, but without additional 
moisture, a change will continue to 
take place, though the starch will re- 
main dry and glistening. The flavor 
grows sweeter and more nutty the 
longer the starchy food cooks in dry 
heat, (See Boiled Potatoes, Boiled 
Rice.) It is only vegetables that are 
composed largely of starch that can 
be kept hot in this manner without 
acquiring a strong taste and poor 
color. Potatoes, if kept in a closely 
covered vessel or with the unbroken 
skins on, will become soggy and dark 
and have a rank flavor. This is ow- 
ing to the retention of moisture, 
which changes some of the starch to a 
sticky gummy mass, and very prob- 
ably to the noxious volatile bodies 
which are generated by heat and 
should be allowed to pass away. If 
the skins are broken and the vessel 
ventilated, potatoes may be kept 
warm a long time without spoiling. 



Overcooking changes and toughens 
the texture of vegetable foods and 
destroys the chlorophyll and other 
coloring matters and volatilizes or in- 
jures the bodies which contribute to 
the flavor. Overcooked vegetables 
are inferior in appearance and flavor 
and often indigestible (that is, pro- 
motive of digestive disturbance) as 
well as unpalatable. 

SUCCULENT VEGETABLES 

Cabbage. — Because of the relative- 
ly large amount of sulphur which 
cabbage contains it is apt to be in- 
digestible and cause flatulence when 
it is improperly cooked. On the 
other hand, it can be cooked so that 
it will be delicate and digestible. It 
is one of our most useful vegetables, 



being available during the late fall, 
winter, and spring months, when 
other green vegetables are diflS- 
cult to procure. The quickest and 
simplest methods of cooking cabbage 
are the best. The essentials for the 
proper cooking of this vegetable are 
plenty of boiling water, a hot fire 
to keep the water boiling all the 
time, and thorough ventilation, that 
the strong-smelling gases, liberated by 
the high temperature, may be carried 
otf in the steam. 

Young cabbage will cook in twenty- 
five or thirty minutes; late in the 
winter it may require forty-five min- 
utes. The vegetable when done should 
be crisp and tender, any green por- 
tion should retain the color, and the 
white portion should be white and 
not yellow or broken. Overcooked 
cabbage or cauliflower is more or less 
yellow, has a strong flavor, and is 
very inferior to the same dish prop- 
erly cooked. In addition, overcooking 
is a cause of digestive disturbance. 

To Boil Cabbage. — Cut a small 
head of cabbage into four parts, cut- 
ting down through the stock. Soak 
for half an hour in a pan of cold 
water to which has been added a 
tablespoonful of salt; this is to draw 
out any insects that may be hidden 
in the leaves. Take from the water 
and cut into slices. Have a large 
stewpan half full of boiling water; 
put in the cabbage, pushing it under 
the water with a spoon. Add one 
tablespoonful of salt and cook from 
twenty-five to forty-five minutes, de- 
pending upon the age of the cabbage. 
Turn into a colander and drain for 
about two minutes. Put in a chop- 
ping bowl and mince. Season with 
butter, pepper, and more salt if it 
requires it. Allow a tablespoonful 
of butter to a generous pint of the 
cooked vegetable. Cabbage cooked in 
this manner will be of delicate flavor 
and may be generally eaten without 
distress. Have the kitchen windows 
open at the top while the cabbage 
is boiling, and there will be little 
if any odor of cabbage in the house. 

Cabbage Cooked with Pork. — For 
a small head of cabbage use about 
half a pound of mixed salt pork. 



216 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Boil the pork gently for three or 
four hours. Prepare the cabbage as 
for plain boiled cabbage. Drain well 
and put on to boil with the pork. 
Boil rapidly for twenty-five to forty- 
five minutes. Serve the pork with the 
cabbage. The vegetable may require 
a little more salt. 

Smoked bacon or ham may be sub- 
stituted for the pork. Cabbage may 
be cooked in water in which corned 
beef was boiled. 

Creamed Cabbage. 

1 pint boiled and minced cab- 
bage, 
i pint hot milk, 
1 tablespoonful butter, 
1 teasjioonful flour, 
i teaspoonful salt, 
J teaspoonful pepper. 

Put the cabbage, hot milk, salt, and 
pepper in a stewpan and on the fire. 
Beat the butter and flour together 
until creamy, then stir into the con- 
tents of the stewpan. Simmer ten 
minutes, being careful not to scorch 
the sauce; serve very hot. 

Cabbage with Sausage. 
6 sausages, 

1 quart minced cabbage, 
i teaspoonful pepper. 
Salt, if necessary.. 

Fry the sausages crisp and brown. 
Take from the frying pan and pour 
off all but three' tablespoonsful of 
the fat. Put the minced cabbage in 
the frying pan and cook six minutes. 
Arrange in a hot dish and garnish 
with the sausages. Serve mashed po- 
tatoes with this dish. 

Puree of Cabbage and Potatoes. 

1 pint boiled finely-minced cab- 
bage, 

6 medium-sized potatoes, 
S tablespoonsful butter or sav- 
ory drippings, 

2 teaspoonsful salt, 

i teaspoonful pepper, 
i pint hot milk. 

Peel the potatoes and put them in 
a stewpan with boiling water enough 



to cover them. Cook just thirty min- 
utes. Pour off the water and mash 
fine and light. Beat in the hot milk, 
seasoning, and cabbage. Cook about 
five minutes longer. 

Cauliflower, — This vegetable, which 
a few years ago was a luxury, is 
now cultivated by nearly all market 
gardeners, and is within the means 
of all housekeepers. It is a most 
delicious vegetable, when properly 
cooked, and vile when improperly 
cooked, which generally means when 
overcooked. 

Remove all the large green leaves 
and the greater part of the stalk. Put 
the head down in a pan of cold wa- 
ter which contains to each quart a 
teaspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful 
of vinegar. Let it soak in this water 
an hour or more. This is to draw 
out worms, if any should be hidden 
in the vegetable. When ready to cook 
the cauliflower put it into a large 
stewpan, stem end down, and cover 
generously with boiling water. Add 
a tablespoonful of salt and cook with 
the cover of the saucepan partially 
off, boiling gently all the time. A 
large, compact head will require a 
full half hour, small heads from 
twenty to twenty-five minutes. If the 
flowers are loose the heat penetrates 
to all parts quickly. "VMien compact 
a little extra time should be allowed 
for the cooking, but the time must 
never exceed the half hour. The 
cauliflower begins to deteriorate the 
moment it begins to be overcooked. 
Overcooking, wliich is very common, 
can be told by the strong flavor and 
dark color. It makes the vegetable 
not only unpleasant to the eye and 
palate, but indigestible also. If this 
vegetable must be kept warm for any 
length of time, cover the dish with 
a piece of cheese cloth. In hotels 
and restaurants it is better to blanch 
it, chill with cold water, and then 
heat in salted boiling water when 
needed. 

Creamed Cauliflower. 

1 pint cooked cauliflower, 

1 pint milk, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 

i teaspoonful pepper, 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES FOR TABLE 217 



1 tablespoonful butter, 
i tablespoonful flour, 
3 slices toasted bread. 

Have the cooked cauliflower broken 
into branches and seasoned with half 
the salt and pepper. Put the butter 
in a saucepan and on the fire. When 
hot add the flour and stir until 
smooth and frothy, then gradually 
add the milk, stirring all the time. 
When the sauce boils add the salt, 
pepper, and the cauliflower. Cook 
10 minutes and dish on the slices of 
toast. Serve very hot. 

Sroccoli. — This vegetable is a spe- 
cies of cauliflower and can be cooked 
and served in the same manner. 

Brussels Sprouts. — This is a spe- 
cies of cabbage, which forms in many 
small heads about the size of an Eng- 
lish walnut on the stock of the plant. 
It is fairly common in most large 
markets and is worthy of more ex- 
tended use than it has commonly met 
with in the United States. 

Brussels Sprouts Blanched. — Re- 
move the wilted or yellow leaves from 
the little heads or " sprouts," cut the 
stock close to the head, and soak in 
salted cold water for an hour or 
more. Drain well and put into plen- 
ty of boiling salted water. Allow 
one teaspoonful of salt to two quarts 
of water. Boil rapidly for fifteen or 
twenty minutes, the time depending 
on the size of the heads. When done 
turn into a colander and pour cold 
water over the heads. They are now 
ready to cook in butter, or to serve 
with any kind of sauce. Or the boil- 
ing water may be drained from the 
sprouts, which can then be seasoned 
with butter, salt, and pepper. 

Brussels Sprouts Saut6. 

1 quart Brussels sprouts, 
3 tablespoonfuls butter, 
i teaspoonful salt, 
i teaspoonful pepper. 

To sauter a food is to cook it 
quickly in a frying pan in a little 
fat. Blanch the sprouts and drain 
well. Put them into a broad-bot- 
tomed saucepan with the butter and 
other seasonings. Place over a hot 



fire and shake frequently. Cook five 
minutes. Serve hot. 

Kale, or Borecole. — There are sev- 
eral varieties of this vegetable. The 
dwarf, green-curled kale is the best 
for the table and is a fall and spring 
vegetable. The leaves are sweeter 
and more tender after having been 
touched by the frost. In the North 
the roots may be banked with earth 
at the beginning of winter and when 
extreme cold weather sets in the 
plants may be covered lightly with 
hay or straw. In the spring the old 
stalks will produce young shoots that 
make delicious greens. 

Kale Boiled with Pork. — Cook the 
kale the same as cabbage with pork. 

Minced Kale. — Remove all the old 
or tough leaves. Wash the kale 
thoroughly and drain, then put on to 
cook in a kettle of boiling water, to 
which has been added salt in the pro- 
portion of 1 tablespoonful to 4 quarts 
of water. Boil rapidly, with the 
cover oflf the kettle, until the vege- 
table is tender. Pour off the water, 
and chop the kale rather fine; then 
put back into the kettle and add 1 
tablespoonful of butter and 2 of meat 
broth or water for each pint of the 
minced vegetable. Add more salt if 
required. Cook for ten minutes and 
serve at once. The time required for 
cooking kale varies from thirty to 
fifty minutes. If young and fresh 
from the garden it will cook in thirty 
minutes. 

Sea Kale. — This is a delicious 
spring vegetable. It requires prac- 
tically the same culture as asparagus, 
and the young shoots are cooked in 
the same way as this vegetable. Sea 
kale may be cut the third year from 
the planting of the seed. Cutting 
should not be continued after the 
flower heads begin to form. The 
flower heads may be cooked the same 
as broccoli. 

Spinach. — This vegetable is a great 
resource in cold weather when green 
vegetables are scarce. 

The common spinach, which is the 
sort usually met with in gardens or 
markets, goes to seed quickly in hot 
weather, but New Zealand spinach, 
which is a very different plant from 



218 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



ordinary spinach and far less well 
known in the United States, yields 
tender greens all summer. The shoots 
should be cut regularly; if not, the 
old shoots become tough and rank 
flavored. 

Spinach has little food value, but 
its refreshing and slightly laxative 
qualites make it a valuable adjunct 
to the more substantial foods. It 
contains little starch and only a sug- 
gestion of sugar, and is therefore one 
of the vegetables that physicians in- 
clude in the bill of fare of many in- 
valids who require a diet without 
these carbohydrates. 

Like most other vegetables, it is 
rarely cooked to perfection, yet it 
is not diflScult to prepare. Except 
for special reasons the simplest meth- 
ods are the best for this vegetable. 
No matter how cheap the raw spinach 
may be, it is always expensive in two 
things — labor and butter. It takes 
a good deal of time, water, and pa- 
tience to wash it clean, and no other 
vegetable requires so much butter if 
it is to be at its best. Where strict 
economy must be practiced, sweet 
drippings from roast beef or chicken 
can be substituted for the butter. 

To clean tlie spinach cut oflP the 
roots, break the leaves apart and drop 
them into a large pan of water, rinse 
them well in this water and put them 
in a second pan of water. Continue 
washing in clean waters until there is 
not a trace of sand on the bottom of 
the pan in which the vegetable was 
washed. If the spinach is at all 
wilted let it stand in cold water until 
it becomes fresh and crisp. Drain 
from this water and blanch. For 
half a peck of spinach have in a large 
saucepan 3 quarts of boiling water 
and 1 tablespoonful of salt. Put the 
drained spinach in the boiling water 
and let it boil ten minutes, counting 
from the time it begins to boil. 
When it begins to boil draw the cover 
of the saucepan a little to one side 
to allow the steam to escape. At the 
end of ten minutes pour the spinach 
into a colander, and when the hot 
water has passed off pour cold water 
over it. Let it drain well and mince 
coarse or fine, as is suitable for the 



manner in which it is to be served. 
One peck of spinach will make 
about li pints when blanched and 
minced. 

Spinach with Cream. 
i peck spinach, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 
1 tablesj)oonful flour, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 

J teaspoonful ])epper, 
i pint cream or milk. 

Blanch and mince the spinach. Put 
the butter in a saucepan and on the 
fire. When hot add the flour and 
stir until smooth and frothy, then 
add the minced spinach and the salt 
and pepper. Cook for five minutes, 
then add the milk or cream, hot, and 
cook three minutes longer. Serve. 

Spinach with Egg. 
i peck spinach, 

3 tablespoonfuls butter, 
i teaspoonful pepper, 

2 eggs, 

3 teaspoonfuls salt. 

Wash and blanch the spinach, using 
two teaspoonfuls of the salt in the 
water in which the vegetable is boiled. 
Drain the blanched spinach and chop 
rather fine, return it to the saucepan, 
and add the salt, pepper, and butter. 
Place on the fire and cook ten min- 
utes. Heap in a mound on a hot 
dish and garnish with the hard-boiled 
eggs, cut in slices. 

Spinach Cooked without Water. — 
Fresh spinach when washed holds 
enough water for cooking. Put the 
spinach in a stewpan and on the fire; 
cover and cook ten minutes. Press 
down and turn the spinach over sev- 
eral times during the cooking. At the 
end of ten minutes turn the spinach 
into a chopping bowl, and mince 
rather fine. Return to the stewpan 
and add the seasonings, allowing for 
half a peck of spinach two generous 
tablespoonfuls of butter and a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Simmer ten min- 
utes; or if very tender five minutes 
will be sufficient. 

Spinach cooked in this manner will 
retain all its salts. It will be more 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES FOR TABLE 219 



laxative and the flavor stronger than 
when blanched (boiled in water). In 
young, tender spinach this is not ob- 
jectionable, but when the overgrown 
vegetable is cooked in its own moist- 
ure the flavor is strong and somewhat 
acrid. 

Lettuce. — If lettuce has grown un- 
til rather too old for salad, it may be 
cooked, and makes a fairly palatable 
dish. 

Boiled Lettuce. — Wash four or five 
heads of lettuce, carefully removing 
thick, bitter stalks and retaining all 
sound leaves. Cook in plenty of boil- 
ing salted water for ten or fifteen 
minutes, then blanch in cold water 
for a minute or two. Drain, chop 
lightly, and heat in a stewpan with 
some butter, salt and pepper to taste. 
If preferred, the chopped lettuce may 
be heated with a pint of white sauce 
seasoned with salt, pepper, and 
grated nutmeg. After simmering for 
a few minutes in the sauce, draw 
to a cooler part of the range and 
stir in the well-beaten yolks of 
two eggs. See also, "Peas with 
lettuce." 

Swiss Chards. — This vegetable is a 
variety of beet in which the leaf stalk 
and midrib have been developed in- 
stead of the root. It is cultivated 
like spinach, and the green, tender 
leaves are prepared exactly like this 
vegetable. The midribs of the full- 
grown leaves may be cooked like 
celery. 

Beet Greens. — Beets are usually 
thickly sowed, and as the young beet 
plants begin to grow they must be 
thinned out. The young plants 
pulled from the bed make delicious 
greens, particularly if the root has at- 
tained some little size. Unfortunate- 
ly, of late years the leaves are at- 
tacked by insects; therefore, they 
must be examined leaf by leaf, and 
all which are infested rejected. Do 
not separate the roots from the 
leaves. Wash thoroughly in many 
waters. Put into a stew]ian and 
cover generously with boiling water. 
Add a teaspoonful of salt for every 
two quarts of greens. Boil rapidly 
until tender. This will be about thir- 
ty minutes. Drain off the water, 



chop rather coarse, season with butter 
and salt. 

The vegetable may be boiled with 
pork as directed for " Cabbage and 
pork." 

Asparagus. — This delicious spring 
vegetable should be treated very sim- 
ply, yet carefully. 

Cut off the woody part, scrape the 
lower part of the stalks. Wash well 
and tie in bunches. Put into a deep 
stewpan, with the cut end resting on 
the bottom of the stewpan. Pour in 
boiling water to come up to the ten- 
der heads, but not to cover them. 
Add a teaspoonful of salt for each 
quart of water. Place where the 
water will boil. Cook until tender, 
having the cover partially ofif the 
stewpan. This will be from fifteen 
to thirty minutes, depending upon 
the freshness and tenderness of the 
vegetable. Have some slices of well 
toasted bread on a platter. Butter 
them slightly. Arrange the cooked 
asparagus on the toast, season with 
butter and a little salt and serve at 
once. Save the water in which the 
asparagus was boiled to use in mak- 
ing vegetable soup. 

Another method of cooking aspara- 
gus is to cut all the tender part 
into short pieces. Add boiling water 
enough to just cover the vegetable 
and place where the water will boil. 
Cook until tender (about fifteen min- 
utes), season with salt and butter, 
and serve in the greater part of the 
juice. 

If preferred, a cream dressing may 
be served with asparagus. 

Globe Artichoke. — The large flower 
bud of the Cynara scolymu^ is known 
as the globe or French artichoke. 
The flower buds must be used before 
they open. The edible portion con- 
sists of the thickened portion at the 
base of the scales and the receptacle 
to which the leaf-like scales are at- 
tached. In cookery books the recep- 
tacles are always spoken of as the 
bottoms. The parts of the flower in 
the center of the bud are called the 
" choke " and nmst always be re- 
moved. 

When the artichoke is very young 
and tender the edible parts may be 



220 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



eaten raw as a salad. When it be- 
comes hard, as it does very quickly, 
it must be cooked. When boiled it 
may be eaten as a salad or with a 
sauce. The scales are pulled with the 
fingers from the cooked head, the 
base of each leaf dipped in the sauce 
and then eaten. The bottoms (recep- 
tacles), which many consider the most 
delicate part of the artichoke, may 
be cut up and served as a salad, or 
they may be stewed and served with 
a sauce. To prepare the artichoke 
remove all the hard outer leaves. 
Cut off the stem close to the leaves. 
Cut off the top of the bud. Drop 
the artichokes into boiling water and 
cook until tender, which will take 
from thirty to fifty minutes, then 
take up and remove the choke. Serve 
a dish of French salad dressing with 
the artichokes, which may be eaten 
either hot or cold. Melted butter also 
make a delicious sauce for the arti- 
chokes if they are eaten hot. 

Spring Greens. — After months of a 
very limited supply of herbaceous 
vegetables, which is the usual condi- 
tion in the northern regions of the 
United States, there is a craving for 
" greens." In almost all localities 
many of the common weeds are ten- 
der and well-flavored when very 
young. If one has a garden, it can 
be so managed that there shall be an 
abundance of fresh roots and greens 
until the time when the regular gar- 
den products are ready. There are a 
number of plants that may be left in 
the garden over winter for early 
spring use. Jerusalem artichokes, 
parsnips, salsify, leeks, and potato 
onions will give roots or buds as soon 
as the frost will permit digging. For 
greens there are such plants as 
curled green kale, and cabbage. The 
roots of these plants should be well 
earthed up, and when the real hard 
freezing weather comes the plants 
must be covered with hay or straw. 

Spinach and kale, or German win- 
ter greens, may be sown in Septem- 
ber. When the hard freezing weather 
comes protect them with leaves, straw, 
etc. Sorrel, if properly protected, 
will make a rapid growth as soon as 
anything begins to grow. It makes 



delicious greens by itself, or it may be 
cooked with other greens. It also 
makes a refreshing salad. The young 
shoots of the milkweed are almost as 
delicious as asparagus, when cooked 
according to the second method for 
cooking asparagus. In fact, the milk- 
weed and asparagus may be cut up 
and cooked together. 

The white goosefoot (Chenopodium 
album), better known by the common 
names " pigweed " and *' lamb's quar- 
ters," grows in almost all cultivated 
land. When very young it makes 
good greens, and should be cooked 
like si^inach. The dandelion, when 
gathered before the flower bud has 
attained any size, makes tender 
greens, and is greatly liked by many 
people because of its pleasant, bitter 
flavor. The cultivated dandelion is 
larger leaved, more tender, and of a 
milder flavor, and is also a fine salad 
if blanched like celery. A small bed 
of this vegetable will give a generous 
return in the spring, for the small 
amount of care it requires. 

The marsh marigold, commonly 
called " cowslip," is found in many 
regions in marshy places. In the 
early spring this jjlant makes good 
greens. Cook the same as spinach. 
Purslane is a weed comixion in most 
gardens and is very palatable as a pot 
herb. It is also cooked like spinach. 

In the Southern States the young 
shoots of the pokeberry or poke tops 
are favorite greens, and are cooked 
like asparagus, while turnip sprouts, 
cabbage sprouts, and coUards are fa- 
vorite greens of garden origin. 

In some regions of Europe young 
hop sprouts are much prized, being 
cooked like asparagus. Though eaten 
to some extent, they do not seem to 
be known to many housewives in this 
coimtry. 

Every locality produces some wild 
plants that are safe and pleasant to 
use as greens. It is important, how- 
ever, that the wild greens shall be 
gathered by persons who are familiar 
with the plants.i

pot herbs, see " Some Additions to our 
Vegetable Dietary," by F. V. Coville. U. S. 
Dept. Agr. Yearbook 1895, p. 805. 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES FOR TABLE 221 



PEAS 

Green Peas. — This vegetable should 
be gathered when the seeds are about 
half grown, and it should be cooked 
as soon as possible after gathering. 
When the peas are thus young and 
tender they are best simply boiled 
and seasoned with salt and good but- 
ter. Some varieties of peas lack 
sweetness, and in this case a little 
sugar in the water in which they are 
cooked improves the flavor. Over- 
cooking spoils the color and flavor of 
the vegetable. Peas should always 
be boiled slowly, and with the cover 
partially off the stewpan. It is im- 
possible to give the exact time of 
cooking this vegetable, since so much 
depends upon the maturity of the 
peas, the length of time they have 
been picked, etc. Young, tender peas 
will generally cook in twenty or 
thirty minutes, and the seasoning 
should be added while they are still 
firm and crisp. If the peas are 
cooked until the green color of the 
chlorophyll is destroyed they are 
overdone and their delicate flavor is 
spoiled. When peas are overgrown 
and a little hard they should be 
cooked by the rule " Peas with pork." 
When this rule is followed a pinch of 
delicate, small, white onions may be 
added to the peas and other ingredi- 
ents and will give a very savory dish. 

Boiled Peas with Butter. — Put one 
quart of shelled peas in a stewpan 
and add enough boiling water to 
cover them generously. Place over a 
hot fire and when they begin to boil 
draw back where the water will bub- 
ble gently. Until the peas are done 
cook with the cover partially off the 
stewpan. When the peas are tender 
add one teaspoonful of salt and three 
tablespoonfuls of good butter. Cook 
ten minutes longer. If the peas are 
not the sweet kind add a teaspoonful 
of sugar with the salt and butter. 

Peas with Pork. 
1 quart peas, 
4 ounces pork, 
1 tablespoonful butter, 

1 gill water (J cupful), 

2 small white onions, 
i teaspoonful pepper. 



Cut pork into small bits. Put but- 
ter into stewpan and on the fire. 
When the butter is melted add the 
pork and cook gently until a light 
brown, then add the water, peas, on- 
ion, and pepper. This is a good way 
to cook peas when they are a little 
old and hard. 

Peas with Lettuce. 

1 quart peas, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 

1 head lettuce — the heart, 

1 small onion, 

1 teaspoonful sugar, 

i gill water. 

Put all the ingredients into a stew- 
pan, cover and place over the fire 
and cook for five minutes, tossing the 
vegetables several times. Now draw 
the pan back where the contents will 
simmer slowly for half an hour. 

Puree of Dried or Split Peas. — 
Soak one quart of dried peas over 
night and follow the directions for 
puree of dried beans. 

Sugar Peas. — The green pods of 
the sugar pea may be prepared like 
string beans. 

Gather the pods while the seeds are 
still very small. String them like 
beans and cut into two or three 
lengths. Cover with boiling water 
and boil gently until tender. If th(.;,' 
are young and fresh they will cook 
in twenty-five or thirty minutes. 
Pour off some of the water, which 
will serve for soup. Season with salt 
and butter and serve at once. When 
the pods are fresh and tender they 
have an exquisite flavor. When the 
seeds have grown large and the pods 
become tough they may be shelled and 
cooked like any other variety of peas. 
The seeds of the sugar pea are ten- 
der and fine flavored. 

BEANS 

Beans are served as a vegetable in 
three stages of growth, namely, the 
tender young pods, the fresh seeds, 
and tlie dried seeds. The pods are 
known as green or string beans and 
as butter beans, depending upon the 
variety. String beans make one of 



^2^ 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



our most delicious vegetables, if 
young and properly cooked. They 
should be gathered before the seeds 
begin to form. In this state the 
bean is sweet, delicate, and tender, 
but not a highly nutritious food. 
Shelled beans, both dried and fresh, 
particularly the former, contain a 
large percentage of nitrogenous mat- 
ter. The dried, ripe, shelled beans 
are apt to produce flatulence and 
sometimes colic. This trouble is 
largely due to the hull or skin and 
the germ, and may be remedied in a 
great measure by proper cooking, 
and, when possible, the removal of 
the hulls. The best forms in which 
to eat dried beans are in soups and 
purees. Beans that have been thor- 
oughly stewed or baked under the 
right conditions may be eaten by peo- 
ple who live a good deal out of doors. 
Fat of some kind is necessary in the 
cooking of beans. The fat has a 
softening influence on the composi- 
tion of the beans, and, since this 
vegetable has a very small percentage 
of fat, it is very desirable to supply 
this element either when cooking or 
when serving the vegetable. When 
possible, beans should be cooked in 
soft water. Dried beans are always 
hard when raw and have a strong 
acrid flavor. To soften them and re- 
move the strong flavor, the vegetable 
should be soaked in cold water, and 
then brought to the boiling point in 
fresh cold water. This water should 
be thrown away and the cooking be 
finished in fresh water. A little soda 
in the water in which the beans 
are soaked and in the water in 
which they are first scalded will 
help to soften and sweeten the vege- 
table. 

Green or String Beans. — Formerly 
it was difficult to find the slender, 
stringless green beans, but to-day the 
progressive market gardeners make a 
point of raising beans of this kind. 
Unfortunately, not all market gar- 
deners and farmers are progres- 
sive, and many still raise a coarse, 
fibrous bean that is a disappoint- 
ment to the consumer. In the 
very early stage of the pod almost 
any kind of bean will be good, if 



properly cooked, but all except the 
stringless kind must have their strings 
carefully removed. The pods should 
be gathered while small and tender. 
If for any reason they become wilted, 
they must be made crisp and fresh 
by being soaked in cold water. The 
beans that are brought from the 
South in cold weather are usually 
more or less wilted. They should 
be freed from strings, cut up, and 
soaked at least twelve hours in cold 
water. They will then cook like fresh 
beans. 

To Blanch Green Beans. — Green 
beans should always be blanched. To 
do this drain them from the cold 
water and put them into water that || 
is boiling rapidly, allowing a tea- '\ 
spoonful of salt to two quarts of 
water. Boil rapidly, with the cover 
partially off the saucepan, for twenty 
minutes. Turn into a colander and 
let cold water run upon them. They 
are now ready to be finished in any 
manner you like. The blanching can 
be done in the morning while the fire 
is good and the beans be finished for 
dinner at the proper time. 

Green Beans, Plain. 
1 quart beans, 
1 pint water, 

1 generous tablespoonful butter, 
1 level teaspoonful salt. 

String the beans if necessary and 
cut them into two-inch lengths. 
Blanch them as directed. Drain and 
put in the saucepan with the water, 
salt, and butter. Cook for ten min- 
utes over a hot fire, turning the con- 
tents of the saucepan from time to 
time. Serve very hot. If the beans 
are not tender it may take fifteen 
minutes to cook them, but under all 
circumstances be careful not to over- 
cook, as this ruins the flavor. If 
overcooked, green beans become yel- 
low or brown. 

Green Beans Boiled with Pork. — 
Boil about a quarter of a pound of 
pork for five hours. Have the beans 
free from strings and cut about 
2 inches long. Cook them with the 
pork until tender (about half an 
hour). 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES FOR TABLE 223 



Green Beans with Pork (French 
Method). 

1 quart boiled beans, 

2 ounces pork, 

1 pint hot water, 
1 teaspoonful flour. 

Cut the pork into small dice and 
put in the stewpan. Cook slowly for 
twenty minutes, then add the water. 
Mix the flour with a few spoonfuls of 
cold water; stir into the pork and 
water. Place the stewpan where the 
contents will cook slowly for an hour. 
At the end of this time add the beans 
and cook half an hour. Taste to see 
if more salt is required. A table- 
spoonful of butter added just before 
serving is a great acquisition to this 
dish. 

Butter beans, the varieties of string 
beans which are pale yellow in color, 
may be cooked like the green string 
beans. 

Scarlet Eunner Beans. — In Great 
Britain the scarlet runner beans, 
which are raised in the United States 
almost exclusively as an ornamental 
plant, are highly prized for the ta- 
ble. The tender green pods are 
" whittled " into small sections (after 
stringing) and cooked in water until 
just tender. Like other green vege- 
tables, they lose their color and deli- 
cate flavor if overcooked. These 
beans are at their best seasoned only 
with butter and salt. 

Shelled Kidney Beans. — All the 
varieties of this bean, when gathered 
while the seeds are still tender, may 
be cooked like the Lima beans. They 
may also be boiled with pork like 
green beans. It takes from one to 
two hours to cook kidney beans. 

Stewed Shelled fieans. 
1 quart shelled beans, 
i pound salt pork, 
1 onion, 

i teaspoonful pepper, 
1 tablespoonful flour, 
1 quart boiling water, 
Salt to taste. 

Cut the pork in slices and fry it 
slowly ten minutes in a stewpan. 
Add the onion, cut fine, and cook 



twenty minutes very slowly. Cover 
the beans with boihng water and boil 
ten minutes. Drain oflF the water. 
Put the beans and flour in the stew- 
pan with the pork and onion, and stir 
over the fire for five minutes. 
Add the quart of boiling water and 
the pepper. Place the saucepan 
where Its contents will simmer for 
two hours. Taste to see if salt 
enough; if not, add salt. 

This method of cooking new shelled 
beans gives a savory and substantial 
dish. 

Green Lima Beans. — Cover 1 quart 
of the shelled beans with boihng 
water. Place on the fire where they 
will boil up quickly, then draw back 
where they will just simmer until 
done. When tender pour off a part 
of the water. Season the beans with 
a teaspoonful of salt and 2 heaping 
tablespoonfuls of butter. 

Or drain the water from the beans. 
Put the butter in a saucepan with 1 
tablespoonful of flour. Stir over the 
fire until smooth and frothy, then add 
the beans and stir over the fire for 
five minutes. Draw back and add 
half a pint of water, meat stock, or 
milk. Simmer ten minutes. If liked, 
a teaspoonful of fine herbs may be 
added a few minutes before serving. 
It will take from forty-five to sixty 
minutes to boil the beans suflSciently. 

Dried Beans. — All dried beans re- 
quire the same preliminary treatment, 
no matter how they are to be finally 
cooked and served. Look them over 
carefully to remove all dirt and peb- 
bles, then wash clean. Soak them 
overnight in plenty of cold water. In 
the morning pour off the water and 
put them in a stewpan with cold 
water enough to cover them gener- 
ously. Let them come to the boiling 
point in this water, then drain. If 
the beans are old and hard, for each 
quart put a piece of soda about the 
size of a large bean in the water in 
which they are soaked overnight, also 
in the first water in which they are 
boiled. 

The scalded and drained beans 
should be put back in the stewpan 
and covered generously with boiling 
water. Add 1 tablespoonful of salt 



224 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



for 1 quart of beans. They should 
now cook slowly, with the cover par- 
tially off the stewpan until they have 
reached the required degree of ten- 
derness. For stewed and baked beans 
the cooking must stop when the skins 
begin to crack. For beans served 
with a sauce they should cook until 
perfectly tender, but they must not 
be broken or mushy. For purees and 
soups they should be cooked until 
very soft. 

Puree of Dried Beans. 

Cook 1 quart of beans in water un- 
til very soft, then drain well (saving 
the water) and rub through a puree 
sieve. Put 1 pint of the strained 
beans in a stewpan with 2 table- 
spoonfuls of butter or savory drip- 
pings, 1 teaspoonful of sugar, 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt, one-fourth of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper, and hot milk 
enough to make the puree like thick 
mush. About half a pint of milk 
will be right. Cook in the double 
boiler for one hour, stirring often 
and adding more milk if too dry. 
Heap the puree in the center of a 
hot platter. Garnish with a circle of 
fried sausages, pork chops, mutton 
chops, or any fat meat. The puree 
may be served as a vegetable, with 
any kind of meat. A soup may be 
made with the water in which the 
beans were cooked and the remainder 
of the strained beans. 

Dried Beans Saute. 

Cook the beans until tender, but 
not broken. Drain off the w^ater and 
save it for soup. For 1 quart of 
beans put 3 tablespoonfuls of savory 
drippings or butter in a large-bot- 
tomed stewpan. When the fat is hot 
put in the drained beans, which have 
been seasoned with a tablespoonful of 
salt and half a teaspoonful of pep- 
per. Cook over a hot fire for fifteen 
minutes, frequently turning the beans 
over with a fork. Cover and let them 
cook for half an hour where they 
will not burn. If the beans are liked 
moist add a cupful of meat broth, 
milk, or water before putting them 
to cook for the last half hour. 

This dish may be made more sa- 



vory by frying a tablespoonful of 
minced chives, shallot, or onion in the 
butter or fat before adding the beans. 
A tablespoonful of fine herbs may 
also be added to the beans to make 
them more savory. 

Dried Beans with Sauce. 

The well-cooked and drained beans 
may be moistened with any good 
sauce and cooked for half an hour. 

Dried Beans in Salad. 

Season the cooked and drained 
beans with any of the salad dress- 
ings described elsewhere and serve as 
a salad. 

Baked Beans. 

Cook the dried beans gently until 
the skins begin to break, then drain 
off the water. Put a layer of beans 
in a bean pot or deep earthen dish, 
and on this layer, in the center of 
the dish, place a piece of salt pork 
("streak of fat and streak of lean") 
having the rind side up, using for 1 
quart of beans a half pound of pork; 
the rind should be scored. Fill up 
the dish with the beans and add sea- 
sonings and water to cover the beans. 
The simplest seasoning is 1 table- 
spoonful of salt and half a teaspoon- 
ful of pepper to a quart of beans. 
Mix the salt and pepper with the 
water. If liked, a tablespoonful of 
mustard may be added as well as a 
tablespoonful or more of molasses 
and an onion. Instead of the pork a 
piece of salt or fat beef or mutton 
may be employed. In this case there 
should be from IJ to 3 pounds of 
the meat per quart of beans. If 
fresh meat be used, add more salt to 
the beans. If, on the other hand, salt 
meat is used, probably 1 teaspoonful 
of salt will be enough. 

When mutton is employed trim off 
every particle of the skin. 

Bake the beans in a very moderate 
oven for eight or ten hours. Add a 
little boiling water from time to time, 
but never enough to bring the water 
beyond the top of the beans. Any 
kind of bean may be baked in this 
manner. However, the small pea 
bean is tlie best for " Boston baked 



i 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES FOR TABLE 225 



beans." The Lima and large white 
beans are best for the deep earthen 
dish. Do not cover the beans while 
baking. 

Lentils. — Lentils may be cooked in 
purees, soups, etc., like dried beans. 

Baked Lentils. 

1 quart lentils. 

1 quart water. 

6 ounces mixed salt pork, 

1 clove of garlic or 1 small 

onion, 
1 generous teaspoonful salt, 
■J teaspoonful pepper. 

Pick over and wash the lentils. 
Soak in cold water overnight. In 
the morning pour off the water and 
put the lentils in a stewpan with two 
quarts of cold water and place on 
the fire. As soon as the water begins 
to boil the lentils will rise to the 
top. Take them off with a skimmer 
and put them in a deep earthen dish, 
with the pork and onion in the cen- 
ter. Mix the pepper and salt with a 
quart of boiling water and add. Put 
tlie • dish in a moderate oven, and 
cook slowly for four or five hours. 
The lentils must be kept moist, and 
it may be necessary to add a little 
water from time to time. If the pork 
is not very salt the dish may require 
a little more salt. 

Stewed lentils are prepared in 
about the same manner, but using 
more water. Instead of pork, fat 
corned beef or the shank of a ham 
may be employed. 

Cowpeas. — Cowpeas (a common 
leguminous vegetable in the south- 
ern United States), also called black- 
eye peas, Whip-poor-will peas, Lady 
peas, cornfield peas, etc., are most ex- 
cellent cooked like shelled beans when 
green. The young pods are also 
served like string beans. The ripe, 
dry beans, which are also very palat- 
able and nutritious, may be cooked 
like dried beans or lentils. 

POTATOES 

There are many varieties of this 
vegetable. Tastes"^ differ as to the 
most desirable kinds. In America 



and in England the white, mealy va- 
rieties are the most prized. On the 
Continent of Europe the " Yellow 
Holland " is a favorite variety. The 
white potato, when light and dry, is 
of delicate flavor and thought to be 
easy of digestion. It is especially 
suited for boiling, steaming, and bak- 
ing, and for soups and purees. The 
yellow potatoes are more suitable for 
preparations in which it is desirable 
that the whole or pieces of potatoes 
shall retain their shape when cooked. 
Such potatoes are the best kind to 
use for salads, ragouts, hash, and for 
the fried potato known as " Pommes 
de terre souiflee," which is like a 
Saratoga chip, except that it puffs up 
like a little sack filled with air. In 
general the yellow potato has a richer 
flavor than the white. 

Tlie potato is in such common use 
that it would seem as if all its char- 
acteristics would be well understood 
and it would be cooked in perfection. 
Unfortunately, the contrary is true, 
and perhaps no other vegetable is so 
carelessly cooked as a rule. 

The potato is a starchy food that 
contains enough moisture in its com- 
position to cook the starch. This 
moisture is in the form of a watery 
juice, in which is dissolved the ni- 
trogenous matter, the various salts, 
sugar, gum, etc. The starch cells are 
surrounded and penetrated by this 
watery bath. In cooking, the nitro- 
genous juice is coagulated in part at 
least by the heat, the starch granules 
swell and burst, and the starch ab- 
sorbs the watery part of the juice. 
When this stage is reached, if the 
moisture has been in the right pro- 
portion, all parts of the potato will 
present a light, dry, glistening ap- 
pearance. Every one concedes that 
such a potato will not cause di- 
gestive disturbance. However, the 
moisture is not always in the right 
proportion. Ripe potatoes and pota- 
toes grown on a well-drained or sandy 
soil will, as a rule, be dry and mealy 
if properly cooked. Potatoes grown 
in a wet season or in a heavy, damp 
soil as a rule contain too large a pro- 
portion of moisture for the starch. 
Old potatoes that are allowed to 



S26 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



sprout will be watery, probably owing 
to the withdrawal of some of the 
starch for food for the growing 
sprouts. 

A poisonous substance called so- 
lanin is found in or near the skin of 
potatoes which have grown exj)osed 
to tlie sun or a strong light. Solanin 
also develops when potatoes are al- 
lowed to sprout, and serious illness 
has been known to follow the eating 
of exposed and sprouted potatoes. 
The green color which a potato ex- 
posed to a strong light takes on is 
largely due to the grains of chloro- 
phyll developed in the parts of the 
tuber exposed to the light. The 
strong flavor is probably due to some 
substance which develops along with 
the chlorophyll. It will be seen that 
potatoes intended for the table 
should not be exposed to strong light 
or be allowed to sprout. 

Potatoes cooked in dry heat, as by 
baking in the oven, roasting in ashes, 
frying in deep fat, or steaming in 
their jackets retain all their salts and 
other constituents, and the flavor is 
more pronounced and savory than 
when cooked in water. But potatoes 
so cooked must be served just as soon 
as they are done, or else they will 
become soggy and bad flavored. 

Potatoes cooked in the skin should 
be free from any blemish and washed 
absolutely clean. Old potatoes, that 
is, potatoes that are kept into the 
spring and early summer, are better 
for being soaked in cold water and 
peeled before cooking. 

OTHER EOOTS AND BULBS 

Jerusalem Artichoke. — This vege- 
table is in season in the fall and 
spring, and may be cooked like kohl- 
rabi and served in a white cream or 
sauce. The artichoke may also be 
cooked in milk. 

When this is done, cut the washed 
and peeled artichoke into cubes, put 
in a stewpan, and cover with milk (a 
generous pint to a quart of cubes). 
Add one small onion and cook twenty 
minutes. Beat together one table- 
spoonful of butter and one level ta- 
blespoonful of flour, and stir this 



into the boiling milk. Then season 
with a teaspoonful of salt and one- 
fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper, 
and continue the cooking half an hour 
longer. The cooking should be done 
in a double boiler. The artichoke also 
makes a very good soup. 

Turnips. — This vegetable is gener- 
ally spoiled by overcooking. The flat, 
white summer turnip, when sliced, 
will cook in thirty minutes. If the 
cooking is prolonged beyond this 
time, the vegetable begins to deteri- 
orate, growing dark in color and 
strong in flavor. The winter turnips 
require from forty-five to sixty min- 
utes. 

Boiled Turnips. 

Have the turnips peeled and 
sliced. Drop the slices into a stew- 
pan with boiling water enough to 
cover generously. Cook imtil ten- 
der, then drain well. They are now 
ready to mash or chop. If they are 
to be served mashed, put them back 
in the stewpan; mash with a wooden 
vegetable masher, as metal is apt to 
impart an unpleasant taste. Season 
with salt, butter, and a little pepper. 
Serve at once. 

Hashed Turnips. 

Chop the drained turnips into 
rather large pieces. Return to the 
stewpan, and for a pint and a half of 
turnips add a teaspoonful of salt, one- 
fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper, a 
tablespoonful of butter, and four ta- 
blespoonfuls of water. Cook over a 
very hot fire until the turnips have 
absorbed all the seasonings. Serve at 
once. Or the salt, pepper, butter, 
and a tablespoonful of flour may be 
added to the hashed turnips; then 
the stewpan may be placed over the 
hot fire and shaken frequently to toss 
up the turnips. When the turnips 
have been cooking five minutes in this 
manner add half a pint of meat stock 
or of milk and cook ten minutes. 

Carrots. — The carrot is valuable as 
a vegetable and as a flavorer. When 
partially grown and fresh from the 
ground they have a delicious flavor, 
and are so tender that they may be 
cooked without water. As the carrot 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES FOR TABLE 227 



grows old the flavor grows stronger, 
and in the majority of varieties the 
heart grows hard and woody. When 
the carrot reaches this stage only the 
outer layers are desirable for food. 

Carrots with White Sauce. 

Scrape the carrots lightly; then 
cut into large dice or slices. Put 
into a stewpan with salted boiling 
water, allowing a teaspoonful of salt 
for a quart of water, and boil until 
tender. The young carrots will cook 
in thirty minutes and the old ones in 
forty-five. Drain, season with a lit- 
tle salt, put them in a vegetable dish, 
and pour the white sauce over them. 
Or the carrots may be cut into dice 
before cooking, and boiled and 
drained as directed; then put them 
back in the stewpan, and for every 
pint add one tablespoonful of butter, 
one teaspoonful of sugar, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and one gill of 
water or meat stock. Cook over a hot 
fire until the carrots have absorbed 
the seasonings and liquid. 

Parsnips. — This vegetable, because 
of its pronounced taste, is probably 
not so generally liked as are most of 
the other roots. It is at its best in 
the early spring, when it has been in 
the ground all winter. 

The simplest method of cooking the 
parsnip is to wash it clean, boil it, 
and then scrape ofp the skin. Now 
cut in slices and put in the vegetable 
dish. Season with salt and butter. 
When the parsnips are tender and 
just out of the ground they will 
cook in thirty-five minutes; when old 
it takes from forty to fifty minutes to 
cook them. The cooked and peeled 
parsnips may be chopped rather 
coarse, seasoned with salt, and put 
into a stewpan with hot milk enough 
to cover them. Place the stewpan on 
the range where the heat is moderate. 

For a pint and a half of parsnips 
beat together one tablespoonful of 
butter and one teaspoonful of flour. 
Stir into the parsnips and milk. Sim- 
mer for ten minutes. Parsnips are 
often cut in slices after boiling and 
fried in butter. 

Salsify. — This vegetable is some- 
times called oyster plant, because the 



flavor suggests that of the oyster, par- 
ticularly when the boiled vegetable is 
sliced and fried in butter. Salsify is 
one of the roots that may be left in 
the ground over winter, thus making 
this vegetable available for the late 
summer, fall, and spring. 

To prevent this root from turning 
dark it must be dropped as soon as 
it is pared and cut into a mixture of 
flour and water made slightly acid 
with vinegar. For 6 good-sized roots 
mix together 1 tablespoonful of vine- 
gar, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt, and 3 pints of water. 
Wash and scrape the roots, then cut 
into slices about 3 inches long. Drop 
into the prepared water. Place the 
stewpan on the fire and cook the 
salsify thirty minutes, counting from 
the time it begins to boil. Drain and 
serve in a white sauce. Or mix to- 
gether 1 tablespoonful of butter, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful of 
lemon juice, and 1 teaspoonful of 
minced parsley or chervil. Add this 
to the drained salsify and serve at 
once. 

Beets. — Beets are among our most 
useful vegetables, since they may be 
had all through the summer and 
may also be stored in good condition 
for winter use. Sometimes beets are 
cut in small pieces, after boiling, and 
served with white sauce, but the most 
common as well as the most palat- 
able way of serving them is with but- 
ter. 

Beets with Butter. 

Wash the beets, being careful not 
to break the skin. Put into a stew- 
pan and cover generously with boil- 
ing water and boil until tender. 
\oung beets will cook in one hour. 
As the beets grow old the time of 
cooking must be increased. In win- 
ter this vegetable becomes so hard 
it may require four or more hours 
of steady boiling to soften it. It is 
then only suitable for pickling in 
vinegar after being thoroughly 
boiled. 

When the young beets are cooked, 
take them from the boiling water and 
drop them into cold water. Rub off 
the skin. Cut the beets in thin slices 



228 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



and season with salt and butter. 
Serve at once. 

Kohl-Rabi, or Turnip Cabbage. — 
This vegetable is a variety of the 
cabbage, but instead of the reserve 
nutritive matter of the plant being 
stored largely in the leaves or flow- 
ers, it is collected in the stem, which 
forms a turniplike enlargement just 
above the ground. Kohl-rabi is fine 
flavored and delicate, if cooked when 
very young and tender. It should be 
used when it has a diameter of not 
more than 3 or 3 inches. As it grows 
large it becomes tough and fibrous. 

Boiled Kohl-Rabl. 

Wash and pare the vegetables, then 
cut in thin slices. Put into slightly 
salted boiling water and boil, with the 
cover partially ofif the stewpan, until 
the vegetable is tender. This will 
take from thirty to fifty minutes. 
Pour off the water and season with 
butter, salt, and pepper. 

Kohl-rabi may be boiled with pork 
in the same way as cabbage. The 
cold boiled vegetable may be served 
as a salad. 

Celeriac. — This vegetable is also 
known as " knot celery " and " turnip- 
rooted celery." The roots, which are 
about the size of a white turnip, and 
not the stalks are eaten. They are 
more often used as a vegetable than 
as a salad. 

Pare the celeriac, cut in thin, nar- 
row slices, and put into cold water. 
Drain from this water and drop into 
boiling water and boil thirty minutes. 
Drain and rinse with cold water. The 
celeriac is now ready to be prepared 
and served the same as celery. 

Puree of Celeriac. 

1 quart celeriac cut in dice, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 
1 tablespoonful flour, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 
1 gill stock or cream. 

Cook the celeriac thirty minutes in 
boiling water, rinse in cold water, 
then press through a puree sieve. 
Put the butter in a saucepan and on 
the fire. When hot add the flour and 



stir until smooth and frothy, and 
then add the strained celeriac and 
cook five minutes, stirring frequently. 
Add the salt and stock or cream and 
cook five minutes longer. If the 
pur^e seems dry, add more stock or 
cream. The vegetable varies as to 
the amount of moisture it requires. 
It should be eaten very hot. If used 
as a garnish, it is generally put in 
the center of the dish and the poul- 
try or meat placed on it or around 
it. Otherwise it may be served on 
toast or fried bread as a dish by 
itself. 

Celery. — The culture of this vege- 
table is so general that one can find 
it in large markets nearly every 
month of the year. Celery is at its 
best in the late fall and early winter, 
when the weather has been cold 
enough to crisp the blanched stalks. 
This plant is most useful as a salad 
and flavorer, but is perhaps most 
commonly eaten raw, without any 
dressing except salt, as an accompani- 
ment of fish, meat, etc. 

Only the tender, inner stalks should 
be eaten raw. The hard, outside 
stalks make a delicious and whole- 
some dish when properly cooked. 
When thus used, celery should be 
blanched and served with a sauce. 

Stewed Celery. 

To blanch celery in cooking, re- 
move all the leaves from the stalks. 
Scrape off all rusted or dark spots, 
cut into pieces about 3 inches long, 
and put in cold water. Have a 
stewpan of boiling water on the fire, 
wash and drain the celery and put in 
the boiling water. Add one teaspoon- 
ful of salt for every 2 quarts of wa- 
ter. Boil rapidly for fifteen minutes, 
having the cover partially off the 
stewpan. Pour off the water and 
rinse with cold water, then drain. The 
celery is now ready to finish in the 
following manner: Put the celery 
in the stewpan with one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, and one teaspoonful of 
salt for each quart of celery. Cover 
and cook slowly for fifteen minutes. 
Shake the pan frequently while the 
celery is cooking. Serve hot. 

Onion. — This vegetable is the most 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES FOR TABLE 229 



useful of all our flavorers, and there 
is hardly a soup, stew, sauce, etc., 
that is not improved by the addition 
of the onion flavor. As a vegetable 
the onion may be prepared in a va- 
riety of ways. The white onions are 
the most delicate and are therefore 
more suitable as a vegetable than the 
yellow or red variety. The large 
Spanish onions and the Bermuda 
onion are also delicate and suitable 
for a table vegetable. If the stronger 
onions are used for this purpose they 
must be thoroughly blanched. 

Boiled Onions in White Sauce. 

Peel the onions and cut off the 
roots, dropping into cold water as 
fast as they are peeled. Drain from 
the cold water and put in a stewpan 
with boiling water to cover gener- 
ously. Add a teasjioonful of salt for 
each quart of water. Boil rapidly 
for ten minutes, with the cover par- 
tially off the saucepan. Drain off 
the water and cover the onion with 
hot sweet milk (a quart of onions 
will require a pint of milk). Sim- 
mer for half an hour. Beat together 
one tablespoonful of butter and one 
level tablespoonful of flour. Add one 
teaspoonful of salt and one-fourth 
of a teaspoonful of white pepper. 
Gradually beat in about half a cupful 
of the milk in which the onions are 
cooking. When smooth, stir the mix- 
ture into the onions and milk. Let 
the dish cook ten minutes longer and 
serve. 

Stewed Onions. 

Cut the onions in slices and boil in 
salted water for ten minutes. Drain 
well and return to the stewpan. 

For a quart and a half of onion, 
measured before it was boiled, add 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, and one-fourth of a 
teaspoonful of pepper. Cover the 
stewpan and cook over a hot fire for 
five minutes, shaking the pan to pre- 
vent the onion from browning. Set 
the stewpan back where the contents 
will cook slowly for forty minutes. 
Drippings may be substituted for the 
butter, but, of course, the dish will 
not be so delicate in flavor. 



MISCELLANEOUS VEGETABLES 

Cucumbers. — The cucumber is 
nmcli oftener eaten in the United 
States as a salad than cooked, yet it 
is a very palatable vegetable when 
stewed and served with a white 
sauce, or seasoned witli butter, salt, 
and pepper, and served on toast. The 
pared and quartered cucumber should 
be cooked until tender in boiling 
salted water, which will require about 
fifteen minutes, and then served as 
directed. Cucumbers may also be cut 
in slices lengthwise and fried like 
summer squash or eggplant. 

Stewed Cucumbers. 

Stew pared cucumbers, cut in quar- 
ters or in thick slices, for fifteen min- 
utes in a saucepan with a little water 
and a minced shallot or a small 
minced onion. Pour off the water; 
stir in a little flour, butter, and salt; 
heat for two or three minutes, and 
then serve. 

Cucumber Saute. 

Boil pared and quartered cucum- 
bers for tliree minutes only. Then 
drain tlie pieces and season with salt 
and pepper. Roll in flour and cook 
in a saucepan with butter for twenty 
minutes. This dish may be varied by 
adding minced parsley, chives, and 
chervil about five minutes before the 
cooking is finished. 

Tomatoes. — The tomato, although 
not very nutritious, may be classed as 
one of our most useful vegetables. 
Raw, it makes an attractive and re- 
freshing salad and may be served by 
itself or in combination with other 
vegetables, with meat or with fish. 
As a vegetable the tomato may be 
prepared in many ways. It makes a 
good foundation for soups and 
sauces. Made into catsup or pickles 
it serves as a relish. The addition of 
a little tomato gives a pleasant, acid 
flavor to many soups and sauces, and 
also to meat, fish, and vegetable 
dishes. If possible the tomatoes 
should ripen fully on the vines, as 
the flavor is much better than when 
picked green and then allowed to 
ripen.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



When properly canned this vege- 
table keeps well and retains its nat- 
ural flavor. The housekeeper who 
has a generous supply of canned to- 
matoes on hand will find them very 
valuable at all times of the year, but 
especially in the winter months when 
the variety of vegetables is not great. 

Overcooking spoils the flavor and 
color of the tomato. 

To Peel Tomatoes. 

Put the ripe tomatoes into a dish 
and ])Our boiling water over them. 
Let them rest in the water about one 
minute; then pour the water off. The 
thin skin will now peel ofif readily. 

When a quantity of tomatoes are 
to be peeled have a deep stewpan a 
little more than half filled with boil- 
ing water and on the fire where the 
water will continue to boil. Put the 
tomatoes in a frying basket and lower 
into the boiling water. Let the bas- 
ket remain one minute in the water. 
There must, of course, be water 
enough to cover the tomatoes. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 

Peel the tomatoes and cut into 
small pieces. Put into a stewpan and 
on the fire. Boil gently for twenty 
minutes or half an hour, counting 
from the time it begins to boil. Sea- 
son five minutes before the cooking 
is finished. Allow for each quart of 
tomato one generous teaspoonful each 
of salt and sugar and one tablespoon- 
ful or more of butter. 

Escalloped Tomatoes. 

1 pint peeled and cut tomatoes, 
1 ]>int grated bread crumbs, 
1 level teaspoonful salt, 
1 tablespoonful butter, 
A suggestion of pepper. 

Reserve three tablespoon fuls of the 
bread crumbs, and spread the re- 
mainder on a pan. Brown in the 
oven, being careful not to burn them. 
Mix the tomato, browned crumbs, 
salt, pepper, and half the butter 
together, and put in a shallow baking 
dish. Spread the unbrowned crumbs 
on top, and dot with the remainder 
of the butter, cut into bits. Bake in 



a moderately hot oven for half an 
hour. The top of this dish should be 
brown and crisp. 

Tomato Toast. 

Boil one quart of peeled and cut 
tomatoes for ten minutes, then rub 
through a strainer. Return to the 
stewpan and add two level teaspoon- 
fuls of salt, half a tablespoonful of 
pepper, and two tablespoonfuls of 
butter. Place on the fire and cook 
five minutes. Have the bottom of a 
hot platter covered with well-toasted 
slices of bread and pour the hot to- 
mato over it. Serve at once. A 
dropped or poached egg may be put 
on each slice of toast. 

Okra. — Though okra, a variety of 
Hibiscus with mucilaginous edible 
pods, will grow in most parts of the 
L^nited States, it is much more com- 
monly eaten in the Southern States 
than elsewhere. Tlie young pods 
should be boiled in salted water until 
tender (about twenty minutes), 
drained, and heated for five minutes 
with cream (a scant cup to a quart 
of okra), a tablespoonful of butter, 
and salt and pepper. Okra is also 
a common ingredient of soups. 

The cultivation of okra, methods of 
serving it, and related topics are dis- 
cussed in a recent publication of the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture. 

Green Peppers. — The sweet green 
pepper, though fairly common in our 
city markets, is not as widely known 
as a vegetable as it deserves. Sliced, 
it makes a very fine salad alone, or, 
more commonly, mixed with other 
salad plants like lettuce. Stuffed and 
baked peppers are very palatable. 

Green Peppers Stuffed and Baked. 

L^se only tender sweet peppers. 
For six medium-sized peppers make a 
dressing in the following manner: 
Soak, in cold water, enough stale 
bread to make one pint when the 
water is pressed out. Season this 
with two teaspoonfuls of salt, one 
tablespoonful of fine herbs, about 
one-fifth of a teaspoonful each of 
sweet basil and sunnner savory, and 
two tablesjioonfuls of butter or sa- 
vory drippings. 



PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES FOR TABLE 231 



Cut off the stem end of the pepper 
and remove all the interior, being 
careful to take out every seed. FiU 
the peppers with the dressing. Place 
them on end in a shallow baking dish 
and pour around them a sauce pre- 
pared as follows: Put into a sauce- 
pan and on the fire, one tablespoon- 
ful of dripiDings. When hot, add one 
level tablespoonful of flour. Stir un- 
til smooth and brown, then add, grad- 
ually, three gills of meat stock or 
water. Season with one level tea- 
spoonful of salt. Cook five minutes, 
then pour around the stuffed peppers. 
Put the dish in a moderately hot oven 
and bake the peppers one hour, bast- 
ing often with the sauce in the dish. 
Peppers may also be filled with a 
well-seasoned dressing of chopped 
meat, made with or without the addi- 
tion of bread crumbs or rice. 

Eggplant. — This vegetable, as well 
as potato and tomato, belongs to the 
nightshade family. Like all succu- 
lent green vegetables, it has little nu- 
tritive value. The common methods 
of cooking are by frying, broiling, 
and baking. 

Baked Eggplant. 

For baked eggplant make a dress- 
ing as for stuffed peppers, except 
that a little more salt, pepper, and 
butter are used. Cut the eggplant in 
two lengthwise, scrape out the inside, 
and mash it fine, then mix with the 
dressing and return to the shells. 
Place on a pan and in the oven. Cook 
forty-five minutes. 

Fried Eggplant. 

For fried eggplant cut the vege- 
table in slices about half an inch 
thick and pare. Sprinkle the slices 
with salt and pile them upon one an- 
other, put a plate with a weight on 
top of the slices. Let them rest for 
an hour, then remove weight and 
plate. Add one tablespoonful of wa- 
ter, half a tablespoonful of salt, and 
half a teaspoonful of pepper to an 
egg. Beat well. Dip the slices of 
eggplant in the egg, then in dried 
bread crumbs. Spread on a dish for 
twenty or more minutes. Fry till 
brown (in deep fat). 



Broiled Eggplant. 

The eggplant is sliced and drained 
as directed above. Then spread the 
slices on a dish, season with pejiper, 
and baste with salad oil, sprinkle with 
dried bread crumbs and broil. 

Squash. — The various varieties of 
the summer squash are generally 
cooked when so small and tender that 
the thumb nail can pierce the rind 
easily. 

To prepare for the table wash the 
squash, cut into small pieces, and 
either cook in boiling water or steam 
it. It will cook in boiling water in 
half an hour. It takes about an hour 
to cook it in the steamer. The cooked 
squash is mashed fine and seasoned 
with salt, pejiper, and butter. This 
method gives a delicate flavored but 
rather watery dish. 

Summer squash is very palatable 
cut in slices and fried like eggplant. 

It is claimed by many that the very 
young summer squashes, particularly 
the turban variety, or " cymlin " of 
the Southern States, are very delicate 
and palatable cooked whole. For this 
dish they should not be much larger 
than a silver dollar. In the opinion 
of the writer the crook-necked and 
other summer squashes are richer in 
flavor when grown to a large size. 
From the more mature squash remove 
the thin skin and seeds. Cut the 
squash in small pieces and put in a 
stewpan with boiling water enough to 
cover. Boil for half an hour. Drain, 
mash, and season with salt, pepper, 
and butter. 

Cook winter squash in the same 
manner. Squash is one of the vege- 
tables that require a good deal of 
butter. 

Green Corn. — Green corn, a typi- 
cal American food product, is a vege- 
table which, for most palates, is eas- 
ily spoiled by overcooking, since the 
longer the cooking period the less 
pronounced the delicate corn flavor. 

Boiled Corn on the Cob. 

The most satisfactory way to serve 
green corn is on the cob. Free the 
corn from husks and " silk." Have a 
kettle of water boiling hard, drop the 
corn into the water and cook ten min- 



232 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



utes. If only a few ears of corn are 
put in a kettle of boiling water, the 
temperature of the water is not low- 
ered greatly and the corn will cook 
in eight minutes. On the other hand, 
if a large quantity of corn is crowded 
into a kettle of boiling water, the 
temperature is very much lowered 
and the time of cooking must be in- 
creased. When possible, surround 
the corn with a generous quantity of 
boiling water. 

Corn Cut from Cob. 

Corn may be cut from the cob and 
heated with butter, pepper, and a 
little milk. For this dish cook the 
ears five minutes in boiling water to 
set the juice. Then with a sharp 
knife cut through the center of each 
row of grains and with the back of 
a case knife press the grains of corn 
from the hulls. Put the corn in a 
saucepan and season with salt, pep- 
per, and butter. Add enough hot 
milk to moisten well, and cook ten 
minutes. Serve at once. 

The raw corn may be cut from the 
cob and treated in the same manner. 

Succotash. 

To a pint of corn cooked as above 
add a pint of cooked and seasoned 
shelled beans. 

Vegetable Hash. — Hash may be 
made with one or many cooked vege- 
tables, the vegetable or vegetables 
being used alone or combined with 
meat or fish. Potato is the most use- 
ful vegetable for a hash, as it com- 
bines well with the animal food or 
with otlier vegetables. 

The conditions essential to a good 
hash are that the vegetables shall be 
cut fairly fine, but not so fine that 
the pieces shall lose their shape or 
stick together — that is, the particles 
should drop apart readily when 
shaken on a fork. Each vegetable 
must be cut up separately, then 
all be mixed. The vegetables, or 
vegetable, and meat or fish must be 
well seasoned with salt and pepper, 
and if liked there may be added a 
little minced onion, chives, parsley, 
chervil, or green pepper finely 
minced. The hash must be moistened 



a little with meat broth, milk, or 
water (not more than half a cupful 
for a quart of hash). When the 
hash is mixed, seasoned, and moist- 
ened put a tablespoonful of butter or 
savory drippings in a frying pan. 
When this is melted put in the hash, 
and spread evenly and lightly in the 
pan. Over this put little dots of but- 
ter or savory drippings, using about 
one tablespoonful in all. Cover the 
pan and place where the hash will 
not burn, but where the heat is fairly 
good, and cook half an hour, then 
fold and turn on a hot platter. A 
rich brown crust will have formed on 
the bottom of the hash if the heat 
was sufficient. Serve very hot. The 
plates on which hash is served should 
be hot. 

Rice. — Wash 1 cupful of rice in 
several waters, rubbing the grains be- 
tween the hands to remove all the 
dirt. Put the washed rice in a stew- 
pan with 2J cupfuls of water and 
1 teaspoonful of salt. Cover and 
place where the water will boil. Cook 
for twenty minutes, being careful not 
to let it burn. At the end of this 
time put the stewpan on a tripod or 
ring and cover the rice with a fold of 
cheese cloth. Let it continue to cook 
in this manner an hour, then turn 
into a hot vegetable dish. The rice 
will be tender, dry, and sweet, and 
each grain will be separate. During 
the whole process of cooking the rice 
must not be stirred. If a tablespoon-

Hominy and Corn Meal. — The 
large hominy, which is so common in 
the southern part of the United 
States, is frequently served as a vege- 
table, either boiled or fried in drip- 
pings. Fine hominy, which is more 
common in the northern part of the 
country, and which is often served 
as a vegetable, should be thoroughly 
washed, and cooked in boiling water 
in the proportion of 1 gill of hom- 
iny to a pint of water, to which a 
half teaspoonful of salt has been 
added. When cold, the boiled hom- 
iny may be cut in slices and fried.

Potatoes, peas, corn, beans, and 
many of the vegetables which are 
universally used, receive fair treat- 
ment, but in American kitchens there 
is still much to learn on the subject 
of how to make the best of what a 
country cook calls " greens." In the 
spring, one craves this sort of food 
for the well-being of the body and 
because appetite demands it. The 
earth yields with the seasons exactly 
the sort of food we ought to eat, and 
eat liberally, for it is nature's own 
medicine. 

First, let us divide vegetables into 
classes. The cereals are rice, wheat, 
barley, corn and other grains. The 
legumes include the large family of 
beans, peas, and lentils. In the root 
class we have beets, carrots, parsnips, 
turnips, and radishes. Green vege- 
tables include a variety of things 
herbaceous, from cabbage to dande- 
lions. In bulbs there is the onion 
family and garlic. Then there are 
what are called fruit vegetables, egg- 
plant, peppers, okra, cucumbers, and 
squash. There is also the fungous 
class, such as mushrooms and truffles. 
Each class has a different food value; 
they require different treatment in 
cookery and are suited to accom^iany 
different foods, although our nation 
would be in no way the loser, either 
in health or economy, if it learned, 
like the French people, to make an 
excellent cooked vegetable serve for 
a complete course. 



234 



Before we consider the cooking of 
vegetables, let us study what their 
properties are and what they do 
for our bodies. Every vegetable 
contains more or less of what is 
called cellulose tissue. This helps 
to keep the stomach and intestines 
healthy. For when we eat meat, we 
put into our stomachs a highly con- 
centrated food that requires the ad- 
dition of other foods, bulky and less 
easily digested, to make a perfectly 
balanced meal. Strange as it may 
seem, the value of vegetables lies in 
the fact that they are made up largely 
of a Hiembranous substance so bulky 
and full of refuse that the stomach 
expels it to the intestines in an al- 
most unchanged condition. Mean- 
while, the blood has taken to itself 
such mineral matter and salts as are 
necessary to the human system. While 
digestion is in progress, the loose mass 
of cellulose is keeping up the peri- 
staltic action that goes on in the 
healthy stomach for several hours 
after eating. It is not necessary that 
there be nourishment in everything 
we eat. We require the pure water 
and salts of green vegetables just as 
much as we do the proteid of meat 
and the nitrogen of legumes. 

MARKETING FOR VEGETABLES 

To get the fullest value from vege- 
tables, they must be fresh. The coun- 
try woman, who can pick green things 



VEGETABLE DISHES AND LEFT-OVERS 



235 



from her garden before the dew has 
dried from them, is lucky indeed. 
The best that can be done by a city 
housewife is to do her own market- 
ing intelligently and carefully. In 
marketing, beware of root vegetables 
which are overclean about the roots. 
The greengrocer has his method of 
reviving stale goods; roots are soaked 
from a withered condition back to a 
fresh^appearance. Cabbage and let- 
tuce are skillfully stripped of their 
outer leaves, and although dirty, 
sandy spinach is less attractive in 
looks than cleaner leaves, it is apt to 
be fresher than that which has been 
revived by washing. Even cucumbers, 
eggplant, and tomatoes can be re- 
vived by an ice-water bath. 

Within thin, membranous walls veg- 
etables inclose a semifluid mass that 
stores up minute cells of starch or 
other material. As soon as the tender 
growth of the young plant is over, 
these cells grow woody and tough. 
You can readily see this process in 
old asparagus, something we hesitate 
to eat; yet in thousands of families 
stale vegetables, which have devel- 
oped the same conditions as if they 
were old, are used for economy's 
sake. It would really, in such a case, 
be better to omit vegetables from a 
menu. One is eating woody fiber, 
which can be torn apart like threads, 
and is almost as difficult as thread 
to digest. 

Suppose we see for Ourselves just 
what this fibrous mass is like. Take 
two messes of peas, one of them green 
things fresh from the pod. Cook 
in boiling water. They will be ready 
for the table in ten minutes, but first 
make them into a puree by forcing 
the pulp through a potato ricer. They 
contain little but pulp. Nothing ex- 
cept skins is left in the strainer. Their 
value lies in the sugar and mineral 
salts they contain. Now, take old 
dried peas such as are used as a base 
for soup. They must first be soaked 
for twenty-four hours in cold water. 
Afterwards long, slow cooking softens 
them so they can be squeezed through 
the ricer. Then it actually takes mus- 
cle to get a purde from them, and 
it is small in proportion to the resi- 



due retained by the strainer. The 
latter consists not only of the dry, 
husky skins of the peas, but also con- 
tains a quantity of waste which no 
stomach can properly digest. Still, 
this pulp made into a soup is a nu- 
tritious dish. That is why so many 
people with slow digestion can take 
in soup such vegetables as corn, to- 
mato, beans, lentils, and celery, when 
the vegetable in its entirety would 
cause them great distress. 

Every vegetable is almost lacking 
in fat; the legumes have the largest 
proportion, and they average only 
three per cent. Therefore, fat in 
some form should be added to every 
vegetable dish. Hence we beat cream 
or butter into mashed potatoes, bake 
beans with a bit of pork on top of 
them, and pour oil over salads. 

PEEPARATION OF VEGETABLES 

Now to the various methods of 
preparation and cooking of vege- 
tables. Probably root vegetables are 
used most largely in every household. 
Keep a small stiflf brush for their 
thorough cleaning. The brush scrubs 
earth from every crevice. Carrots, 
parsnips, and salsify also require 
scraping after having been scrubbed. 
Turnips, kohl-rabi, and celeriac should 
be pared. Beets must be well 
cleansed, but not broken anywhere, 
nor even have the tops cut, else they 
will " bleed," thus losing their fine 
sweet flavor. 

With most of the root vegetables, 
except potatoes, white and sweet, the 
only method for cooking is to boil 
them by dropping them into water at 
a bubbling boil. Turnips, carrots, 
parsnips, kohl-rabi, and celeriac will 
cook in half an hour if they are young 
and fresh; winter vegetables require 
from forty to sixty minutes. Young 
beets take an hour; old beets require 
boiling all day. The best way to cook 
them is to consign them to the fireless 
cooker. But one can make these root 
vegetables as palatable as skilled 
French cooks do by the simple process 
of blanching. 

Blanching means bleaching; its 
object is to remove from winter vege- 



236 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



tables their strong acrid flavor. Then 
too, it improves their quality. Let us 
blanch turnips, for instance; then you 
can apply the same process to a va- 
riety of vegetables. Have a large 
saucepan with '2 quarts water at a 
rapid boil; add 1 tablespoonful salt; 
drop into it the pared turnips and 
bring the water back to the boiling 
point as quickly as possible. Cook 
rapidly, uncovered, for thirty minutes. 
Drain off the water, put the turnips 
in a strainer, and cool them under 
the cold-water faucet; then set away 
in a covered disli until you are ready 
to prepare them for the table. Cut 
them into rather hirge pieces, put in a 
saucepan with a tablespoonful butter, 
a dash pepper, a teaspoonful salt, 
and 4 tablespoonfuls meat stock or 
milk. Cook over a hot fire until the 
vegetables have absorbed both season- 
ings and liquid. Serve at once. 

Blanching of vegetables results in a 
saving of time, because they may be 
cool<ed in the leisurely hours of the 
morning, then quickly reheated when 
dinner is being prepared. Cabbage, 
cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, string 
beans, peas, onions, celery, kohl-rabi, 
carrots, parsnips, spinach, Swiss 
chard, artichokes, and salsify are 
vegetables which may be blanched be- 
fore the final cooking. 

Before using vegetables wliich form 
heads, such as lettuce, cabbage, cauli- 
flower, kale and Brussels sprouts, 
cleanse thoroughly by soaking half 
an hour, head down, in cold, salted 
water, with a few tablespoonfuls vine- 
gar in it. This causes insects or 
worms concealed among the curly 
leaves to crawl out. Spinach requires 
no end of washing. The best way to 
cleanse it is to keep filling two pans 
with cold water and washing the 
greens till not a grain of sand settles 
in the bottom. Celery also requires 
thorough washing, as considerable 
dirt clings to both stalks and roots 
during the blanching process. 

VEGETABLE COOKERY 

Different vegetables require differ- 
ent methods of boiling. All of them 
should be dropped into water whicli 



is vigorously bubbling. For a few 
minutes the process will be inter- 
rupted, but if the kettle is placed 
over a hot part of the stove, it will 
soon begin to boil again rapidly. This 
must be continued for herbaceous 
vegetables, young peas, and beans. 
Root vegetables and cauliflower re- 
quire gentler treatment. To quote a 
French cook, " Do not let the water 
grin; keep it smiling." 

As soon as vegetables are tender, 
lift them off the fire and drain, never 
allowing anything to stay in hot wa- 
ter for a minute after it has been 
cooked. While cooking vegetables of 
any kind, leave the saucepan uncov- 
ered; volatile bodies liberated by heat 
pass off in steam. Cabbage and 
onions closely lidded are sure to fill 
the house with an unpleasant odor as 
soon as they are imcovered; but if 
cooked without a lid, such odors are 
scarcely noticeable. 

When peas and beans are so ripe 
as to be slightly tough, they may still 
be made appetizing and digestible if i 
teaspoonful soda is added to the wa- 
ter. This helps to make them tender 
as well as retain the color, but be- 
ware of adding too much soda; it 
will give the food an exceedingly un- 
jileasant flavor. 

Vegetables are invaluable for mak- 
ing cream soups. Take green peas, 
for instance. Boil 1 quart jicas and 
1 small onion in 3 pints water. When 
soft, squeeze the puree tlirough a po- 
tato ricer; add it to the liquor in 
which the vegetables were boiled. Rub 
together 1 tablespoonful flour with 
Q tablespoonfuls butter. This makes 
sufficient thickening. Season with 2 
level teaspoonfuls salt and i tea- 
spoonful pepper; then add 1 quart 
scalding-hot milk. Cook ten minutes, 
stirring frequently. Serve with crou- 
tons or wafers. 

The outside stalks of celery, besides 
corn, beans, onions, potatoes, cauli- 
flower, spinach, leeks, tomatoes, or 
lettuce may often be economically 
converted into cream soups. In this 
way a vegetable left-over is deli- 
ciously re-served. 

\^'hen spinach and dandelion are 
expensive, try cooking celery leaves 



VEGETABLE DISHES AND LEFT-OVERS 



237 



exactly as you would other greens, 
boiling them in salted water, then 
chojjping slightly and seasoning with 
butter, pepper, and salt. By saving 
the leaves from three or four bunches 
and keeping them bouquet fashion, 
with their stalks in water, you may 
soon accumulate enough leaves for a 
small, savory dish of celery greens. 

Boiling potatoes is such an every- 
day task that it seems almost un- 
necessary to offer a recipe for it, yet 
how seldom do we find a cook make 
the best of potatoes. If potatoes are 
"new," they should merely have their 
skins rubbed off; if old, wash them 
well, soak half an hour in cold water, 
then pare off a ring lengthwise around 
the potato. This allows the skin to 
be taken off easily after boilng. Put 
them in a saucej)an with plenty of 
boiling water, add a tablespoonful 
salt, boil another fifteen minutes, then 
drain off every drop of water, and 
leave them to dry for ten minutes cov- 
ered with a folded towel. 

To prevent staining j^our fingers, 
while paring potatoes keep the pota- 
toes in cold water. To peel new po- 
tatoes without staining the hands, 
place them in a pail with a few small 
stones and some water. Shake the 
pan briskly and all the skins will soon 
rub off. 

If beans, potatoes, or other vege- 
tables should be burned while cook- 
ing, the scorched flavor can be largely 
removed by promptly plunging the 
kettle, containing the vegetables, into 
cold water. Allow it to stand for 
several minutes. Remove the contents 
of the kettle to another vessel, cover 
with boiling water, and finish cook- 
ing. 

If a kitchen window is kept open 
two inches at the top while frying 
foods, boiling cabbage or other odor- 
ous vegetables, the unpleasant odor 
will go out of the window instead of 
spreading through the house. 

Cream Sauce for Vegetables. 

A favorite method for serving many 
vegetables is in cream sauce. A dish 
of creamed cauliflower will illustrate 
how potatoes, carrots, cabbage, peas, 
parsnips, artichokes, salsify, celery. 



onions, Brussels sprouts, and aspara- 
gus may be cooked. Blend 2 table- 
spoonfuls butter with 2 tablespoonfuls 
flour; then add gradually 1 pint hot 
milk, and beat till creamy. Add 1 
teaspoonful salt, a dash pepper, and 
a small head blanched cauliflower 
broken into branches. Set it at the 
back of the stove where it may cook 
slowly for ten minutes. 

Steamed Spinach. 

The best way to cook spinach for 
preserving its refreshing and laxative 
qualities is not to add water, for after 
thorough washing the leaves retain 
enough moisture to steam it. Put it 
dry in a saucepan over the fire; in 
ten minutes it will be ready to drain 
and chop. Afterwards return it to 
the pan and season with 2 table- 
spoonfuls butter and a teaspoonful 
salt. Let it simmer ten minutes be- 
fore serving. Old, tough spinach is 
better if blanched before it is sea- 
soned and served. 

When cooking an old fashioned 
boiled dinner, place the spinach in a 
cheese cloth bag, then when the dinner 
is done it can be easily taken out and 
the other vegetables will not be 
covered with bits of green. 

Boiled lettuce. 

Wash -l or 5 heads lettuce, remov- 
ing thick, bitter stalks and retaining 
all the sound leaves. Cook in boiling 
salted water for ten or fifteen min- 
utes, then blanch in cold water. 
Drain, chop lightly, and heat in a 
stewpan with butter and pepper to 
taste, or the chopped lettuce may be 
heated with a pint of white sauce 
seasoned with salt, pepper and grated 
nutmeg. After simmering for a few 
minutes in the sauce, draw to a cooler 
part of the range. A little of the hot 
sauce may be added to the well- 
beaten yolks of -2 eggs and then com- 
bined with the creamed lettuce. 

Beet Greens. 

Wash thoroughly, put into a stew- 
pan, and cover with boiling water. 
Add a teaspoonful salt for every 2 
quarts greens. Boil rapidly for thirty 
minutes. Drain off the water, chop

rather coarsely, season with butter 
and salt. 

Asparagus Tips in Cream. 

Cut the tender part of asparagus 
into short pieces. Add boiling water 
enough to cover the vegetable, and 
cook fifteen minutes. Drain. Serve 
in a cream dressing. 

Boiled Peas with Butter. 

Put 1 quart shelled peas in a stew- 
pan and add enough boiling water to 
cover them. When they begin to boil, 
draw back where the water will bub- 
ble gently. When tender, add 1 
teaspoonful salt. Cook ten minutes 
longer. Drain off what little water 
remains, add 3 tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter. If the peas are not tlie sweet 
kind, add a teaspoonful sugar. 

Peas with Pork. 
1 quart peas, 
4 ounces jDork, 

1 tablespoonful butter, 
i cupful water, 

2 small white onions, 
I teaspoonful pepper. 

Cut pork into small bits. Put but- 
ter into stewpan; when it melts add 
the pork and cook gently until light 
brown, then add the water, peas, 
onion, and pepper. This is a good 
way to cook peas when they are old. 

Peas with Lettuce (French recipe). 

1 quart peas, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 

1 head lettuce (the heart), 

1 small onion, 

1 teaspoonful sugar, 

i cupful water. 

Put the vegetables into a stewpan, 
cover, and cook for five minutes. 
Draw the pan back where the con- 
tents will simmer slowly for half an 
hour, drain, season, and serve hot. 

Sugar Peas in the Pod. 

Gather the pods while the peas are 
very small. String them like beans 
and cut into two or three lengths. 
Cover with boiling water, and boil 
gently twenty-five or thirty minutes. 



Season with salt and butter, and serve 
at once. 

Peas with Dumplings. 

1 pint grated bread-crumbs, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 
i teaspoonful sugar, 

1 teaspoonful parsley (chopped 
fine), 

Pinch of salt, 

2 eggs. 

Stir the butter through the bread- 
crumbs, add the sugar, salt and pars- 
ley. Beat the eggs well and add. 
Lastly stir all together with a fork 
and form into small balls very lightly 
with the hands. Cook peas in the 
usual way and season with salt, but- 
ter, milk and a little thickening. 
Drop dumplings in and cook five min- 
utes. Keep lid on tight. — Ola Mil- 
ler. 

Peas and Carrots. 

Wash carrots, scrape and cut into 
cubes. Put into boiling water and 
boil till tender with cover on. ^Mien 
done drain off water. Cook peas as 
usual. Put peas in middle of dish 
and carrots around edge of peas. 
Season with salt, pepper, and butter. 
Serve hot.— Mabel Dahl. 

Peas in Potato Cases. 

Boil 2 pounds peeled potatoes; 
drain and beat until smooth and light; 
season with salt, pepper and grated 
nutmeg, and add 1 tablespoonful of 
butter and the yolks of 2 eggs. Beat 
until these ingredients are well 
blended and smooth. When cool roll 
out, using a little flour, to the thick- 
ness of about li inches. Cut into 
rounds the size of a tumbler and with 
a smaller cutter remove a piece from 
the top of each as though making pat- 
ties. Brush over with beaten egg, 
roll in fine breadcrumbs and fry to a 
light brown color in hot fat. Fill the 
cases with cooked peas seasoned and 
tossed in butter, and place the piece 
removed from the center on top of the 
peas to form a lid. — Gladys Brown. 

Baked Beans with Tomato.

until done. When tender, pour off 
the water. Season with a tea- 
spoonful salt and 2 tablespoonfuls 
butter. 



Dried Beans Saut6d. 

Soak beans over night, and cook 
until tender, but not broken. Drain 
when soft. For 1 quart beans put 3 
tablespoonfuls butter in a stewpan. 
When hot, put in the beans, which 
have been seasoned with a tablespoon- 
ful salt and 1 teaspoonful pepper.

Soak in cold water over night. In the 
morning pour off the water and put 
them in a stewpan with 2 quarts cold 
water and place on the fire. As soon 
as the water begins to boil, the len- 
tils will rise to the top. Take them 
off with a skimmer and put in a deep 
earthen dish, with the pork and onion 
in the center. Mix the pepper and 
salt with a quart boiling water and 
add. Put the dish in a moderate 
oven, and cook slowly four or five 
hours. The lentils must be kept 
moist, and it may be necessary to add 
a little water from time to time. — 
Maria Parloa. 

Stewed Okra. 

Use only the small green pods, not 
more than two and a half inches 
long. Wipe the pods, cut off the 
stems and tips, if the latter be dis- 
colored. Put them into boiling salted 
water and cook gently for twenty 
to thirty minutes. Drain off the wa- 
ter, add 1 tablespoonful butter, 1 ta- 
blespoonful vinegar, and a little pep- 
per and salt. Let them simmer at 
the back of the range until the but- 
ter is absorbed, then turn out 
without breaking the pods, and serve

Baked Tomatoes. 

Fresh tomatoes are excellent cooked 
in this way, but in winter and spring 
canned ones may be used. Place in 
the bottom of a pan or baking dish 
that will hold the amount you wish to 
prepare a layer of sliced tomatoes; 
salt and pepper these, and dot with 
bits of butter. Then put in a layer 
of cracker or bread crumbs. Con- 
tinue until dish is full, ending with a 
layer of crumbs. If the tomatoes are 
not juicy, add a little water. Bake 
in a slow oven about an hour. — Lois 
Percy. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 

Put rijie tomatoes into hot water 
and skin them, then remove them to 
an earthen stewpan (a new tin one 
will do, but is not so good). Cut up 
the tomatoes and let them cook gently 
a few minutes, season with butter, 
pepper, salt, and serve. Or add bread 
crumbs and sugar to the tomatoes if 
preferred. Some cooks stew tomatoes 
for a long time, but the flavor is finer 
if they are allowed to simmer but a 
few moments. — Mrs. A. J. Mielke.

Drain the peppers, fill with macaroni, 
adding to each a generous spoonful 
of grated cheese. Bake in a granite 
dish with very little water until the 
peppers are tender. Serve with to- 
mato sauce made from fresh or 
canned tomatoes pressed through a 
sieve and thickened with melted butter 
to which a tablespoon ful flour has

Fried Cucumbers. 

Wash carefully ordinary sized green 
cucumbers, cut into slices lengthwise, 
halve, and roll in flour or egg and 
bread crumbs and fry in lard and but- 
ter. The butter is used to give to 
them a golden brown color. The pur- 
pose of keeping the skin on cucumbers 
is to prevent the pieces from break- 
ing. But if cucumbers are not too 
tender, they may be pared before 
frying, as they will keep in shape. — 
Mrs. A. J. Mielke. 

Fried Turnips.

VEGETABLE LEFT-OVERS 

The possibilities for utilizing cold 
vegetables are greater than those for 



VEGETABLE DISHES AND LEFT-OVERS 



251 



any dish that comes to the American 
table. Almost every vegetable in 
common use, from the ragged outside 
leaves of lettuce to a cupful of cold 
string beans, may reappear as a tasty 
hot dish or a tempting salad. Left- 
over spinach, corn, lettuce, tomato, 
string beans, peas, squash, cauliflower, 
carrots, onions, or beans may be con- 
verted into savory soups, and nearly 
every vegetable in the market when 
cold can reappear as a salad. If the 
left-overs are many and small, the 
result may be a Macedoine salad, 
a name which is applied to any salad 
in which cold boiled vegetables are 
combined. Each vegetable in such a 
salad should be kept separate, and 
generally the dish can be arranged in 
such a charming scheme of color that 
it is a pleasure to the eye. Vegeta- 
bles may be cut in cubes, strips, tri- 
angles, tiny balls, or in fancy shapes, 
formed by a vegetable cutter. During 
the summer, when young beets, tur- 
nips, carrots, and green vegetables 
are at their best, these salads may 
be had in perfection. If left-overs 
of vegetables come from the table 
coated with cream sauce or mayon- 
naise, put each by itself in a colander. 
Wash off in cold water, drain thor- 
oughly, chill before using, and the 
vegetable will be as good as if freshly 
cooked. Plenty of a crisp green 
vegetable, lettuce, water cress, or 
parsley, is necessary, however, to 
make a Macedoine salad perfect. 

Spinach in Molds. 

2 cupfuls cold spinach. 
Pepper and salt,

the base of each with parsley, and 
serve on top a spoonful sauce tar- 
tare.

if possible, which are of the same 
size. When this cannot be done, put 
the larger potatoes at the bottom of 
the saucepan, the small ones on top. 
Wash, pare, and put in cold water to 
prevent them from becoming discol- 
ored. During the winter, when pota- 
toes grow old and soft, soak for two 
hours before cooking. Put in boiling 
salted water and cook until soft. 
Drain and serve in a dish with 
folded napkin over them. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Select the smoothest potatoes and 
those of uniform size for baking. 
Scrub with a vegetable brush and lay 
on rack in oven. They will require 
forty minutes in a hot oven. When

cately brown. Shake as free from 
fat as possible before lifting frying 
basket from the kettle, and put to 
drain on absorbent paper. Dust with 
salt. Be careful that the fat is not 
too hot, as the potatoes must cook be- 
fore they brown, also allow the fat 
to reheat each time before frying an- 
other portion of potatoes. 



French Fried Potatoes. 

Wash and pare potatoes, cut them 
into lengthwise strips, and soak an

till the potatoes are covered with a 
thin brown glaze. Baste occasionally 
with the sirup. 

LEFT-OVER POTATOES 

There are all sorts of methods for 
making warmed-up potatoes, so dif- 
ferent that they will never taste alike 
twice in succession. One day there 
may be a suspicion of onion about the 
dish, another a rich flavor given by 
a spoonful of beef extract, a dash of 
chives, parsley, cayenne, or celery. 
Or they may appear au gratin with a 
delicate cheese flavor. Mashed potato 
may be warmed again or may re- 
appear in a dozen different ways. 

There are a few rules to remem- 
ber in the keeping of left-over pota- 
toes. Never put them hot into the 
refrigerator. Nor allow them to 
stand in an uncovered dish. For if 
you do, they will acquire a tough, 
disagreeable skin, and will be re- 
duced to nothing by paring. Use 
cold potatoes before they are two 
days old. In hot weather they will 
not keep more than twenty-four 
hours. The sense of smell will speed- 
ily reveal to you if they have soured. 

In hot weather use potatoes as 
often as possible in a salad. In this, 
too, seek variety. There are endless 
recipes for potato salads. Do not 
make a salad of old potatoes, the 
newer they are the more satisfactory 
the salad. In Germany, potatoes for 
a salad are always boiled in their 
skins, and it is a fact that they taste 
better than when pared before cook- 
ing. The neatest method for prepar- 
ing them is to cut the potatoes into 
cubes about half an inch square or in 
tiny balls with a potato scoop. Do 
not cut them too thin or small; if you 



260 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



do they will break, and nothing looks 
more uninviting than a mushy potato 
salad. 

Potatoes absorb a great deal of 
dressing, and they ought to marinate 
at least an hour before being served. 
One of the most acceptable of potato 
salads is a combination of potato and 
pickled beet witli Worcestershire 
sauce and onion juice added to the 
marinade. Another is made with 
finely sliced onions as a flavor, and 
a sprinkling of chopped taragon, 
parsley, and chervil. A third has 
celery and chopped cabbage with 
minced pickle and hard-boiled egg. 
Mushrooms and minced pickle com- 
bined are a favorite addition to po- 
tato salad. Lettuce or celery enters 
into the make-up of others. Indeed, 
there are few things among vege- 
tables that will not combine well with 
potatoes. Cold peas are good, so are 
tomatoes, green peppers, olives, 
asparagus, red cabbage, cauliflower, 
capers, turnips, carrots, cucumbers, 
or string beans. Sometimes a relish 
is added to the potato salad by a few 
slices of salt salmon, several an- 
chovies, or sardines. 

Sweet potatoes may be put through 
the potato ricer and converted into 
croquettes or a pudding or pie. They 
may be glazed with sugar and butter, 
warmed in cream, or make an excel- 
lent souffle. Another way is to cut 
them in thick slices, dip in flour, egg, 
and crumbs, and fry in deep fat, or 
slice them into a fritter batter, and 
fry.

THE ART OF SOUP-MAKING 

DIRECTIONS FOR SOUP-MAKING — SOUP STOCK — THICK SOUPS 

— CLEAR SOUPS — VEGETABLE SOUPS — PUREES — MEAT 
SOUPS — BROTH — CREAM SOUPS — CHOWDERS — BOUILLONS 

— FISH SOUPS, 



Soup making is as much of an art 
as turning out fine cake or pastry, 
still the American housewife devotes 
twice as much study to the making 
of sweet dishes as to soup. The 
French woman makes a trifle of 
something sweet serve as dessert, 
while her soups are famous the 
world over. It is economy to be 
able to provide a soup which will of- 
ten take the place of the fiece de re- 
sistance in a dinner, for a fine bisque 
or smooth, creamy soup is a meal in 
itself. Then there are the stimulat- 
ing thin soups which make a proper 
beginning to a dinner. Soup is di- 
vided into several classes — soups with 
stock and soups without — and the va- 
riations which can be wrought by a 
clever housewife on these are num- 
berless. With a pot of stock on hand 
and the assistance of vegetables for 
stockless soups, even in a frugal home 
there may be a soup for everyday 
in the year. Besides, we have ex- 
cellent soups made from fish, and sat- 
isfying chowders with the addition of 
potatoes which makes the dish a full 
meal. 

In recipes for making stock, the 
list of ingredients for seasoning seems 
endless. Still, a good cook keeps on 
hand everything that tends to fine 
flavoring. Spices such as mace, bay 
leaves, peppers, etc., are very cheap, 
so are the winter vegetables that 
most recipes call for and they may be 
kept constantly on hand. In a large 
family where there is a roast or 



263 



meat dish once, perhaps twice, a day, 
little fresh meat is required for the 
stock pot if all bones and scraps are 
saved and utilized. Every morsel of 
a stew, roast with its gravy, chop 
and steak bones, carcasses of chick- 
en or game, and the trimmings from 
meat, which a housewife pays for 
and should insist on having, are all 
good for the soup kettle. The meats 
to avoid using are bits of raw lamb or 
mutton with fat on them, which gives 
a disagreeable flavor, also smoked or 
corned meat. Scraps of bacon, cold 
ham, or even calf's liver may be add- 
ed; they give a touch of good flavor- 
ing. Several utensils are a necessity 
for soup making. First there is a 
sharp meat knife, a hard-wood board, 
a strong furie strainer, a soup pot 
with a tight lid, and a strainer with 
a slide, which allows it to be placed 
across the tureen. 

A soup pot need not do a con- 
tinuous performance on the back of 
a stove from Monday to Saturday. 
It is too handy for all sorts of fag- 
ends to be thrown in without being 
critically looked over; besides, the 
stock which is constantly at the boil, 
or very near it, does not extract the 
nourishment from meat and bones 
that cold water does. If you would 
have fine-flavored, good-colored soup, 
save all the scraps and keep in a 
scrupulously clean jar in the refrig- 
erator. Make soup twice a week; 
three times if the weather is too hot 
for meat remains to keep, or if they 



264. 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



accumulate very fast. Never add a 
morsel of anything that has the 
slightest taint; "it will spoil the whole 
kettleful. Break bones thoroughly. 
If you would extract all the flavor 
from bits of meat, put them through 
a chopper. Lay the bones at the bot- 
tom of the pot. 

If there are any left-overs in the 
refrigerator of such vegetables as 
onions, celery, tomatoes, carrots, pars- 
nips, or peas, chop fine and add, but 
do not put in too much of one thing; 
it gives too strong a flavor to the 
soup. If there are no left-over vege- 
tables on hand, chop J cupful each of 
carrot, turnip, and celery, and add 
for flavoring, with A teaspoonful pep- 
percorns, 1 bay leaf, sprig of parsley, 
6 cloves, and 1 chopped onion. Do 
not add salt till the stock is half 
cooked. 

If you relish celery in soup and live 
where it cannot be secured the year 
round, dry the celery leaves as you 
get them and put them away in a 
fruit jar. When preparing soup, tie 
a few of the leaves in a cloth, and 
drop it into the kettle. You will find 
that the soup will have even more of 
the taste of celery than when using 
the stalk. 

Cover the bones with cold water 
and set far back on the stove where 
it will come to the boil slowly. Let 
it simmer five or six hours, strain 
through a fine sieve, and cool as 
quickly as possible. Do not remove 
the cake of fat from the top of the 
soup until you are ready to use it, 
then run a thin knife around the 
edge to loosen it. Cut into quarters 
and lift each piece carefully. If 
there are any grains of fat left on 
the top of the jellied stock, dampen 
a bit of cheese cloth and carefully 
wipe over the top. Floating globules 
of grease will ruin the finest-flavored 
soup. 

For an everyday family soup in 
which nourishment is the first con- 
sideration, it does not require clear- 
ing. In the sediment there is con- 
siderable nutriment. If it is to be 
cleared, set the strained, skimmed 
soup over the fire, mix with the 
white and crushed shell of one egg, 



a dash of celery seed, the chopped 
rind and juice of half a lemon, and 
pepper and salt if required. Mix 
thoroughly, heat slowly, stirring con- 
stantly, and boil ten minutes. Pour 
through the finest strainer and two 
thicknesses of cheese cloth, and heat 
again to the boiling point before 
serving.

less cooker with water, allow it to

boil slowly fifteen minutes. Add 
the flavoring and vegetables. Cook 
ten minutes longer without raising the 
lid, set it into the cooker five 
hours.

the saucepan of the cooker, cover 
with cold water and boil slowly fifteen 
minutes. Put into the cooker for six 
hours. When soup is lifted out, 
strain it, chop the meat fine, add the 
chopped onion, seasonings, thicken 
with brown flour, and cook for a few 
minutes. After pouring into the 
tureen, add the yolks of the eggs cut 
in pieces, also some fine cubes of 
lemon. An excellent way to make 
this soup, as well as many others, is 
to leave it in tlie cooker over night, 
then strain, skim off" any fat that may 
rise, allow it to cool, and prepare 
when needed for the table.

it, and add to it the eggshell broken 
up. When the stock has cooled, add

with the red-tomato coloring. If it 
were left to cool, it would become a

1 large onion minced fine, 
4 tablespoonfuls butter, 

3 tablespoonfuls flour, 

1 tablespoonful minced celery or 
a few dried celery leaves, 

i teaspoonful peppers, 

2 teaspoonfuls salt. 

Wash the beans and soak them over 
night in cold water. In the morning

salt and pepper, and cook twenty min- 
utes or more. Any kind of beans 
may be used for this soup; Lima 
beans give the most delicate soup,

are very satisfactory and are less ex- 
pensive than Limas. In cold weather 
the quantities of beans and flavorings 
may be doubled, but only 6 quarts 
water are used. 

The resulting thick soup can be 
kept in a cold place and a portion 
boiled up as required and thinned 
with meat stock or milk. — Maria

Olam Soup. 

i peck clams in shells, 

Salf to taste, 

1 teaspoonful pepper, 

J teaspoonful cayenne pepper, 

1 tablespoonful chopped onion, 

1 tablespoonful chopped parsley, 

1 tablespoonful butter, 

2 tablespoonfuls flour, 

2 cupfuls milk or cream. 

Prepare the clams by boiling in 
the shells, and cutting as directed for 
clam chowder, keeping the soft part 
separate from the hard. Pour off 1 
quart clam liquor after it settles, be- 
ing careful not to take any of the 
sediment; put it on to boil, and re- 
move the scum. Add 1 pint hot wa- 
ter, and season to taste with salt, pep- 
per, cayenne, onion, and parsley. 
Put in the hard part of the clams. 
Simmer fifteen minutes, strain, and 
boil again, and when boiling thicken 
with flour cooked in the butter. Add 
the hot milk or cream and the soft 
part of the clams; serve at once. 

Another method of preparing clam 
soup, if needed quickly, is to heat 
the clam broth to a boiling point, 
add the clams cut fine, season, and 
pour into the tureen over 2 eggs 
beaten up with boiling milk. — Mary 
J. Lincoln. 

Onion Chowder. 

3 quarts boiling water,

for half an hour, but slowly, so the 
onion will not brown. At the end of 
this time, add the boiling water, po- 
tatoes, salt, and pepper, and cook 
one hour longer, then add the fine 
herbs, and serve. — Maria Parloa. 

Sportsman's Broth (English recipe). 

Take grouse, partridge, or any other 
game you have; cut in small joints, 
put them into a pot with water and 
plenty of vegetables whole. Let it

take the best pieces you have saved 
out, season them and toss in a little 
flour; brown over a quick fire, and 
add to the strained stock with 12 
small onions, 2 heads celery, sliced, 
and half a cabbage shredded fine, 
to stew slowly till tender. Half an 
hour before serving, add 6 iDotatoes 
cut in slices. 

Clam Chowder.

^ teaspoonful white pepper, 

1 tablespoonful butter, 

1 quart milk, 

6 butter crackers. 

Wash clams with a small brush, 
and put in a kettle with i cupful 
water. When the clams at the top 
have opened, take them out with a 
skimmer, and when cool enough to 
handle, take the clams from the 
shells; remove the thin skin; cut off 
all the black end (cut the " leather 
straps" into small pieces), leaving 
the soft part whole. Let the clam liq- 
uor set, and pour it off carefully. 
L^se half water and half clam liquor. 
Fry the pork and onion; add the po- 
tatoes, which have been soaked and 
scalded, and boiling water to cover.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



the beans are tender; then strain the 
soup, season to taste with salt, and 
serve with small pieces of toasted 
bread. This soup may be served 
without being strained — some people 
prefer to have the beans whole in the 
soup. 

Mixed Vegetable Soup. 
3 quarts water, 
1 pint shredded cabbage, 
1 pint sliced potato, 
^ pint minced carrot, 
i pint minced turnip, 
i pint minced onion, 

1 leek, 

2 tomatoes, 

2 tablespoonfuls minced celery, 
2 tablespoonfuls green pepper, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter or drip- 
pings, 

3 teaspoonfuls salt, 

i teaspoonful pepper. 

Have the water boiling hard in a 
stewpan and add all the vegetables 
except the potatoes and tomatoes. 
Boil rapidly for ten minutes, then 
draw back where it will boil gently 
for one hour. At the end of this 
time add the other ingredients and 
cook one hour longer. Have the 
cover partially off the stewpan dur- 
ing the entire cooking. This soup 
may be varied by using different 
kinds of vegetables. 

Tomato Soup. 

1 quart peeled and finely cut 

tomatoes, 
1 quart cold water, 
1 onion, 

1 tablespoonful sugar, 

2 teaspoonfuls salt, 

i teaspoonful pepper, 
2 tablespoonfuls butter, 

4 tablespoonfuls cornstarch, 
1 tablespoonful flour. 

Mix the cornstarch with the water 
and put into a stewpan with all the 
other ingredients, except the butter 
and flour, the onion being left whole. 
Stir frequently until the soup boils, 
then cook half an hour, counting 
from the time it begins to boil. At 
the end of this time beat the butter 



and flour together until light and 
smooth and stir into the soup. Cook 
ten minutes longer, then take out the 
onion and serve the soup with toasted 
or fried bread. If a smooth soup is 
desired strain through a fine sieve. 
This is the simplest kind of tomato 
soup. It may be varied by the addi- 
tion of rice, macaroni, beans, peas, 
and other vegetables. Instead of the 
fried bread stale bread may be cut 
in small pieces and put in the bottom 
of the soup tureen. 

Okra and Tomato Soup. 

1 pint sliced okra, 

IJ pints tomatoes pared and cul 
fine, 

2 quarts water, 

3 tablespoonfuls rice, 

3 tablespoonfuls minced onion, 
1 green pepper, seeds removed 
and pepper cut fine, 

3 teaspoonfuls salt, 

^ teaspoonful pepper. 

Put all the ingredients into the 
soup pot arid cook gently for two 
hours, then add two tablespoonfuls of 
butter or sweet drippings and serve. 
The bones from roast meat or broiled 
meat cooked with this soup add to 
the flavor. 

Potato Soup. 

8 medium-sized potatoes, 
^ pint chopped celery, 

4 tablespoonfuls minced onion, 
1 tablespoonful butter, 

1 tablespoonful flour, 

li teaspoonfuls salt,

parsley, 
1 quart milk. 

Pare the potatoes and put in a 
stcwj^an with the celery and onion. 
Cover with boiling water and put over 
a hot fire. Cook thirty minutes, 
counting from the time the pan is put 
over the fire. Reserve half a cupful 
of the milk cold, and put the balance 
to heat in the double boiler. Mix the 
flour with the cold milk and stir into 
the boiling milk. When the potatoes, 
etc., have been cooking thirty minutes

pour ofP the water, saving it to use 
later. Mash and beat the vegetables 
until light and fine, then gradually 
beat in the water in which they were 
boiled, rub through the puree sieve 
and then put back on the fire. Add 
the salt and pepper. Beat with an 
egg whisk for three minutes, then 
gradually beat in the boiling milk. 
Add the butter and minced herbs and 
serve at once. 

Cream of Leek Soup. 

Make this soup as directed for leek 
soup, using only 3 pints of water. 
When it is cooked, rub through a 
sieve, return to the soup pot, and add 
1 quart of hot milk. Beat with whisk 
until smooth. Half a cupful of the 
milk can be reserved cold and added 
to 2 well-beaten yolks of eggs. Stir 
this into the soup just as it is taken 
from the fire. 

The yolks of the eggs make the 
soup very much richer. 

Onion Chowder. 

3 quarts boiling water, 
1 pint minced onion, 
1 quart potatoes cut in dice, 
3 teaspoonfuls salt, 
i teaspoonful pepper, 
3 tablespoonfuls butter or sa- 
vory drippings, 

1 tablespoonful fine herbs. 

Cook the onion and butter together 
for half an hour, but slowly, so that 
the onion will not brown. At the 
end of this time add the boiling 
water, potatoes, salt, and pepper and 
cook one hour longer, then add the 
fine herbs and serve. 

Scotch Broth. 

3 pounds mutton, 

2 tablespoonfuls of pearl barley, 
2 tablespoonfuls of minced onion, 
2 tablespoonfuls of minced turnip, 
2 tablespoonfuls of minced carrot, 
2 tablespoonfuls of minced celery, 

2 tablespoonfuls of salt, 
1 teaspoonful of pepper, 

1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 

3 quarts cold water. 

Remove the bones and all the fat 



from the mutton, cut the meat into 
small pieces and put it into a stew- 
pan with the water, chopped veg- 
etables, barley, and all the seasoning 
excepting the parsley. It will be 
found convenient to tie the bones in 
a piece of thin white cloth before 
adding them to the other ingredients. 
Bring the stew to a boil, quickly 
skim it and allow it to simmer for 
three hours, thicken with the flour, 
and add the chopped parsley. 

Split Pea Soup. 

1 pint split peas, 
4 quarts water, 
J pound salt pork, 

1 large onion, 

2 tablespoonfuls celery, 
2 tablespoonfuls flour, 

2 tablespoonfuls butter, 
1 teaspoonful pepper, 
1 sprig parsley. 

Pick the peas over, that there may 
be no blemished ones among them, 
then wash and soak in cold water 
over night. In the morning turn off 
the water and put them in the soup 
j)ot, with the cold water and salt 
pork. Simmer gently seven hours, 
being careful that the soup does not 
burn. When it has cooked six hours 
add the seasoning. Have a large 
wooden spoon to stir the soup. When 
done it should be thin enough to 
pour. By boiling it may become too 
thick; if so, add boiling water. 
When thoroughly cooked, the soup 
is smooth and rather mealy. If not 
cooked enough, after standing a few 
minutes the thick part will settle, 
and the top look watery. At the end 
of seven hours strain the soup 
through a sieve and return to a 
soup pot. Beat the flour and butter 
together until creamy, then stir into 
the soup and simmer half an hour 
longer. If the salt pork has not sea- 
soned the soup sufficiently add a 
little salt. For some tastes the soup 
would be improved by the addition 
of a quart of hot milk. 

Serve little squares of fried bread 
in a separate dish. 

Cream of Bean Soup. 
Make as above, but add only 



278 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



enough of the water in which the 
beans were cooked to make the mix- 
ture like thin mush. Have this very 
hot and add boiling liot milk to make 
it like thick cream, about a quart of 



milk to 3 pints of the bean pur^e. 
Boil up at once and serve. It spoils 
a cream soup to let it cook many 
minutes after the milk is added. 



CHAPTER XXI 
THE ART OF SALAD-MAKING 

HINTS ON SALADS — MEAT SALADS — VEGETABLE SALADS — 
FRUIT AND NUT SALADS — MIXED SALADS — SPECIAL 
SALADS — FISH SALADS — POULTRY SALADS — POTATO 
SALADS — SALAD DRESSINGS — BOILED DRESSING — 
FRENCH DRESSING — FLAVORED DRESSINGS — CREAM 
DRESSING — MAYONNAISE — OIL MAYONNAISE. 



Not many years ago salads were 
considered a luxury only to be found 
on the tables of the wealthy. To-day 
a wider knowledge of cookery has 
taught the housewife who has a small 
income that there is no more econom- 
ical, wholesome, and nourishing dish 
than a well-made salad. She is begin- 
ning to realize, as the French do, that 
almost anything can be put into a 
salad, and that even cheap materials 
with a mayonnaise or a simple French 
dressing make a palatable as well as 
a cheap and most sightly dish. 

There are four essentials to a good 
salad; everything that goes into it 
must be ice cold, the green vegetable 
used must be perfectly clean and 
crisp, the ingredients of the dressing 
must be properly proportioned and 
thoroughly blended, and the salad ma- 
terials should be well mixed just be- 
fore the dish is served. If these rules 
are followed, a simple head of lettuce 
with a plain French dressing is a per- 
fect dish. 

No nicer way can be found to serve 
a vegetable salad than to bring the 
materials to the table crisp, fresh, and 
green, and dress it at the time it is 
to be served. For this purpose a 
large salad bowl, accompanied by a 
wooden knife and fork, and a small 
tray containing a cruet of oil and 
vinegar with pepper and salt, are a 
necessity. 

279 



For nearly every salad, lettuce is 
used as a base, although other green 
plants such as romaine, chicory and 
endive are being used more and more. 
If a whole head of any green is not 
required at once, it may be kept fresh 
for several days. As soon as it 
comes from the market, sprinkle it 
and put it away tightly covered in 
the refrigerator. A good receptacle 
to keep for greens is a 5-pound lard 
pail with a tight lid. When required, 
clip off with shears the ragged, with- 
ered ends of the outside leaves, for 
often the portion nearest the stem is 
good enough to put into the base of 
the salad, to eke out quantity even if 
it is not to be eaten. Separate the 
rest of the leaves, wash thoroughly, 
and leave them for fifteen minutes to 
crisp in ice-cold water, or put in a 
cheese cloth bag in the refrigerator 
at least one hour before serving. 
Ivook over each leaf carefully for dirt 
or any of the insects that are to be 
found clinging to green stuff. Dry by 
shaking lightly in a wire basket tak- 
ing care that none of the leaves be- 
come bruised or broken. 

If the refrigerator is stored away 
and tiie cellar is warm from the heat- 
ing plant there, an excellent way to 
keep lettuce crisp and tender, is to 
wrap each head separately in a piece 
of old linen, wet in cold water. Mois- 
ten tiie linen every day, and you can 



280 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



keep lettuce for two weeks. The in- 
ner leaves will be yellow and crisp, 
and there will be no wasting of outer 
leaves. 

Cold cooked vegetables or any left- 
over that is to be utilized in a salad, 
such as string beans, potatoes, or 
peas, are best if marinated for an 
hour or two before being used in a 
French dressing, leaving them in a 
cold place. If the salad is to be 
Macedoine, make a blend of various 
vegetables, marinate each one by it- 
self, and only put together before 
sending to the table. Meat that is to 
go in a salad is much improved by 
standing for a short time in French 
dressing before using. Fish should 
be flaked or cut in neat cubes. 

There is a strong prejudice among 
manj"^ people against oil. This is 
often due to the fact that one has 
tasted a mayonnaise made of strong 
rancid oil. Those who appreciate 
salads should become judges of good 
oil. Our California oils and various 
cottonseed and nut oils are now of 
the finest quality and are sold at a 
more moderate price than Italian oils. 
Good oil has a fresh, pleasant odor 
and a pale-green tinge. For people 
who really find the taste of oil ob- 
noxious, there are various recipes for 
boiled dressings in which butter takes 
the place of oil and makes very good 
salad. A cook can make a blend of 
boiled dressing with a tablespoonful 
of oil mayonnaise in which it is al- 
most impossible to detect any taste 
of oil. An excellent way is to make 
a pint of each dressing and keep 
it in the refrigerator tightly corked. 
Sometimes a few tablespoonfuls of 
cream, whipped stiff, add a certain 
deliciousness to a mayonnaise that 
nothing else can give. Such a dress- 
ing is especially good when sour 
apples or celery are blended. Do not 
use " any old vinegar " in a salad ; 
the best is none too fine. 

During the summer, when all sorts 
of fresh green vegetables are abun- 
dant, it is a good plan while cooking 
what is to be used for dinner to dou- 
ble the amount needed so as to liave 
a surplus for the next day's salad. 
This applies to such vegetables as 



green peas, string beans, cauliflowerj 
turnips, carrots, new potatoes, spin- 
ach, asparagus, artichokes, beets, okra, 
or Brussels sprouts. In winter there 
need be no dearth of salads, for we 
have constantly with us cabbage, cel- 
ery, and many of the canned vege- 
tables, as well as fresh and canned 
fruits. 

A salad must be handled gently. 
It cannot be stirred as one would do 
when cooking a dish. To break let- 
tuce leaves makes them unsightly. 
Pour the dressing over what ingredi- 
ents are to be served in salad fashion, 
and toss with two forks till each 
particle is coated with the mayonnaise 
or French dressing but without be- 
coming mussy or broken. 

A variety of flavorings is a boon 
to the housewife who has not a great 
number of materials within her reach. 
Day by day even a plain potato or 
lettuce salad may be made a different 
dish by the use of some small addition 
as a flavor, such as chives or tiny 
pickled onions strewn over it. Or 
to make a difference in the seasoning, 
use a mere hint of garlic one day, 
tarragon vinegar the next, or mint 
which can be added to a salad or two. 
The cook can make very cheaply for 
herself a number of flavored vinegars 
which will serve for a long time. To 
obtain any flavor, put the herb de- 
sired in a bottle, cover with white- 
wine vinegar, cork, set the bottle in 
o©id water, and bring it to a boil.

cumber, sweet basil, chives, onion, 
celery, summer savory, garlic, or pep- 
pers can be used in this way. 

Nearly all vegetables may be served 
in the form of salad. The salads 
made with the raw vegetables are 
more refreshing and perhaps more 
generally relished than those made 
with cooked vegetables. The most 
common green salad plant in the 
United States is undoubtedly lettuce, 
and perhaps celery, alone or mixed 
with other materials, next. Endive, 
chicory, blanched dandelion, and 
other ])lants should also be used, as 
they give a pleasant variety to the 
menu. Such salads are garnished 
hke lettuce. In most of our gardens

the only sort of lettuce grown is some 
variety of the head lettuce. Roman 
lettuce, the " Salade Romaine " of 
Europe, which is fairly common in 
our city markets, is a delicious va- 
riety, which should be more generally 
used by American housekeepers. 

Raw vegetables should be used only 
when they are young, tender, and 
fresh. When boiled green vegetables 
are used for a salad they should not 
be cooked so long that they lose crisp- 
ness and flavor. Salad dressings are 
usually sharp or pungent sauce, with 
which the salad is moistened and sea- 
soned, or " dressed." The most ser- 
viceable all-round salad dressing is 
what is known as French salad dress- 
ing. This is sluitable for any vege- 
table salad, raw or cooked. Besides 
the dressing proper there are several 
herbs which are used as flavorers. In 
continental Europe some or all of 
these herbs are almost an invariable 
accompaniment of all lettuce salads 
and nearly aU other green salads. 
These herbs are, in France, termed 
the fourniture of the salad, and it 
is a saying among the French that 
the fourniture is essential to all sal- 
ads, while the use of garlic, hard- 
boiled eggs, etc., is optional. The 
herbs generally employed in the four- 
niture are chervil, tarragon, chives, 
or cibol. These flavor deliciously 
lettuce and other tender green salads. 
They are also a great acquisition to 
soups, sauces, omelets, etc., one or 
more being employed to give special 
flavor to a dish. They may be read- 
ily cultivated in the kitchen garden. 

lettuce Salad with French Dressing. 
2 heads lettuce, 
2 or 3 sprays tarragon, 
6 or 8 branches chervil, 
1 tablespoonful minced chives or 
cibol, if the flavor be liked, 
French dressing. 

Remove all the green, tough leaves 
from the heads of lettuce. Break off 
the tender leaves one by one and rinse 
in cold water. Shake oflF the water 
and lay the leaves on a piece of cheese 
cloth and put the lettuce, wrapped 
lightly in the cheese cloth, on ice. At 



serving time, put the leaves in the 
salad bowl. Have the herbs torn into 
small bits and sprinkle over the let- 
tuce. Sprinkle the dressing (a 
spoonful at a time) over the salad. 
Lift and turn the salad with the 
spoon and fork. Continue mixing in 
this manner until all the dressing has 
been used. The work must be done 
lightly and carefully that the lettuce 
shall not be crushed. Serve immedi- 
ately. This is the French salad that 
so many travelers remember with 
great pleasure. The secret of its ex- 
quisite quality is that the lettuce is 
crisp and tender, delicate flavoring 
herbs are added to it, the vinegar is 
never strong, the oil is good, and, 
finally, the dressing is added just be- 
fore the salad is served. In the heat 
of the summer, when head lettuce is 
not plenty, the tender young plants 
may be used. The flavor of the salad 
may be varied by the addition of 
other green salads and herbs, such as 
chicory, sorrel, borage, burnet, etc. 
When fresh tarragon is not available, 
tarragon vinegar may be employed.

and over all pour mayonnaise dress- 
ing. Serve chilled on lettuce leaf. 

Cucumber Jelly. 

This will serve twelve. Pare and 
slice five cucumbers. Place in the 
kettle with one cupful of cold water, 
one teaspoonful of salt, two sprigs of 
parsley, and cook until cucumbers are 
soft. Press through a sieve, reheat, 
and add one tablespoonful of granu- 
lated gelatine, which has been soaked 
in i cupful of cold water, one ta- 
blespoonful of vinegar and i tea- 
spoonful of paprika. Strain through 
cheese cloth or very fine strainer, and 
color a delicate green, using spinach 
juice, or pure vegetable color. Turn 
into very small timbale molds, and 
when cold and firm, turn out on slices 
of tomatoes, which have been dressed 
with a French dressing. Garnish 
with lettuce leaves and mayonnaise. 
The jelly can be molded in one mold, 
and garnished with slices of tomato 
at serving time. Place a spoonful of 
mayonnaise on each slice. 

Frozen Fruit Mayonnaise. 
1 cupful mayonnaise, 
I cupful whipped cream, 
Si cupfuls mixed and candied 
fruits (maraschino cherries, 
candied pineapple, oranges, 



sliced peaches, stoned cherries), 
1 teaspoonful powdered sugar, 
1 teaspoonful gelatine. 

Soak gelatine in cold water, and set 
over steam to melt. Beat into may- 
onnaise. Combine with whipped 
cream, stir into the fruit, pour into 
a mold wliich has been rinsed in cold 
water. Seal carefully, and bury in 
equal parts of ice and salt for four 
hours. Serve on lettuce heads. — 
Anna Kinsley. 

DRESSINGS OR SAUCES FOR SAL- 
ADS 

In making mayonnaise, I find that 
using vinegar which has been poured 
over pickles, beets, or cucumbers, in- 
stead of fresh vinegar, adds a pleas- 
ant flavor to salads. 

Oil Mayonnaise. 
Yolk 1 egg, 
1 teaspoonful salt, 
i teaspoonful powdered sugar, 
1 tablespoonful lemon juice, 
1 cupful olive oil, 
i teaspoonful mustard, 
1 tablespoonful vinegar. 

Rub a bowl with the cut side of an 
onion, put in the dry ingredients and 
stir them together, then mix to a paste 
with a teaspoonful vinegar. Blend 
with the yolk of the egg, stirring till 
perfectly smooth. Now, begin to ])ut 
in the oil, a few drops at a time, beat- 
ing constantly with a Dover egg beat- 
er. Alternate the oil with a little 
vinegar and lemon juice, until all in- 
gredients have been used. AVhen 
finished, the mayonnaise ought to be 
like a thick jelly. Better success will 
be had if all the ingredients are the 
same temperature when starting. 

Oil Dressing, Boiled. 

IJ teaspoonfuls mustard, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 

2 teaspoonfuls powdered sugar, 
Few grains cayenne, 

2 tablespoonfuls oil, 

J cupful vinegar, diluted with 

cold water to make J cupful, 
2 eggs slightly beaten.

Mix dry ingredients, add egg and 
oil gradually, stirring constantly un- 
til thoroughly blended; then add di- 
luted vinegar. Cook over boiling 
water until mixture thickens; strain 
and cool. 

Tomato Mayonnaise. 

2 solid tomatoes, 

Yolks 2 hard-boiled eggs, 

Yolk 1 raw egg, 

i cupful oil. 

Few grains cayenne, 

3 drops onion juice. 

Peel the tomatoes; cut them in 
halves and press out all the seeds, re- 
taining the solid portion. Chop and 
press through a sieve. Mash the 
yolks of the hard-boiled eggs until 
very fine; add the yolk of the raw 
egg; when thoroughly mixed, add the 
oil a little at a time. When thick and 
smooth, add the dry pulp of the to- 
mato (which has been draining while 
you are making the dressing). Add 
the tabasco and onion juice. This is 
a delicious dressing for cold beef or 
mutton. 

Roqueforte Salad Dressing:. 

Cream 2 ounces (i cup) Roque- 
fort cheese, using wooden spoon. 
Beat in 6 tablespoonfuls olive oil, 2 
tablespoonfuls vinegar, A teaspoonful 
each of salt and paprika. Serve on 
head lettuce, etc. — Anna Kinsley, 

French Dressing. 

1 tablespoonful vinegar, 
3 tablespoonfuls olive oil, 
i teaspoonful salt, 
i teaspoonful pepper. 

Put the salt and pepper in the 
salad bowl, or in a small bowl if the 
sauce is to be served separately. Add 
a little oil and stir well, then grad- 
ually add the remainder of the oil, 
stirring all the while. Last of all 
stir in the vinegar, which should be 
diluted with water if very strong. 

This sauce may be modified to suit 
different vegetables. As it is given 
it is right for lettuce, chicory, cooked 
asparagus, cauliflower, artichoke, 
etc. 



Cream may be substituted for the 
oil, but the salad is not so rich. 

French Dressing. 

1 tablespoonful vinegar, 
3 tablespoonfuls olive oil, 
i teaspoonful salt, 
i teaspoonful pepper. 

Put the salt and pepper in the 
salad bowl, or in a small bowl if the 
sauce is to be served separately. Add 
a little oil, stir well, then gradually 
add the remainder of the oil, beating 
constantly. Last of all stir in the 
vinegar, which should be diluted with 
water if very strong. This dressing 
may be modified to suit different veg- 
etables. 

Cream Dressing. 

^ tablespoonful salt, 

i tablespoonful mustard, 

f tablespoonful sugar, 

1 egg slightly beaten, 

2i tablespoonfuls melted butter, 

I cupful cream, 

i cupful vinegar.

Beat the cream with an egg beater 
until smooth, thick, and light. Mix 
the other ingredients together and 
gradually add to the cream, beating 
all the while. 

This dressing may be modified to 
suit different vegetables. Having 
beaten sour cream for a foundation 
the seasoning may be anything de- 
sired, as, for example, the mustard 
and lemon may be omitted and the 
dressing be seasoned highly with any 
kind of catsup. 

A sweet cream may be substituted 
for the sour; it should be quite thick. 

Sour-Cream Dressing. 

1 cupful sour cream, 

2 tablespoon fuls lemon juice, 
2 tablespoonfuls vinegar, 

2 scant tablespoonfuls sugar, 
1 teaspoonful salt, 
I teaspoonful pepper,

a bowl and mix well. Add the eggs, 
and beat thoroughly. Now add the 
milk, and vinegar slowly, place the 
bowl in a pan of boiling water, and 
cook till the sauce thickens like thin 
cream. Stir the sauce constantly 
while cooking, and bottle what you do 
not require for immediate use. If 
butter is substituted for oil, add it 
just before taking the dressing from 
the fire. 

Cooked Dressing.

YEAST BREADS, DOUGHS AND BATTERS 

BREADMAKING, WHEAT BREAD, GRAHAM BREAD, RYE-, OAT- 
AND CORNMEAL-BREAD — SMALL BREADS MADE FROM 
YEAST — ROLLS, BATTER CAKES, DOUGHNUTS, COFFEE 
CAKE, ETC., ETC. 



Of first importance in every house- 
hold is good bread. Not hit-and- 
miss bread — fair at one baking, poor 
at another — but a sweet, wholesome, 
nutty-flavored loaf, beautiful chest- 
nut brown all over, and so perfectly 
baked as to be palatable when ten 
days old. 

The very best flour is the cheapest; 
it makes the finest bread, it contains 
the largest amount of nutrition, and 
it produces twice the quantity of 
wholesome bread that cheap flour 
does. In nearly every pantry you 
find two brands of flour; usually we 
call them bread flour and pastry 
flour. It is possible to make fair 
pastry and good cake from bread 
flour, but it is hard to make good 
bread from pastry flour. You can 
apply three tests to flour to discover 
whetlier it will make good bread; 
first, it should be of a creamy color; 
second, it will cake slightly when 
gathered up into the hand, falling 
apart in a gritty sort of way when 
tiie fingers are released; third, its 
wetting capacity is very different 
from poor flour, one quart of first- 
class bread flour absorbing about 
one and a half cupfuls of water. Be- 
fore purchasing a barrel, or even a 
half-barrel, of flour, buy a bagful, try 
one sort after another, use the same 
yeast, and the same care with the mix- 
ing, raising, and baking. Presently 
you will discover with what flour you 
have the best success; then stick to 
that brand. As for yeast; none is 



292 



better than compressed yeast, which 
can be found fresh every day even in 
the smallest village. If it has been 
kept too long, it will begin to show 
dark streaks, have a strong odor, and 
it will not break clean. 

Let us stop for a minute to study 
the properties of yeast and its action 
when mixed with flour and liquid, 
then it will be much easier to un- 
derstand what is happening during 
the process of bread making. If you 
could look at a drop of yeast under a 
microscope, you would see a mass of 
tiny, rounded cells. You can im- 
agine how tiny they are when I tell 
you there are fifty billion cells in a 
two-cent yeast cake. Each cell is a 
minute sac filled with watery matter, 
and while you watch, you may see 
new cells budding out of the old ones. 
Yeast is the same fungus which finds 
its way into cans of fruit that have 
not been hermetically sealed, and into 
maple sirup or anj'^ sweet liquid which 
is not properly protected from the 
air. Then, given a warm temperature 
and sugar for the creation of oxygen, 
it begins to " work," as every house- 
wife knows to her sorrow. The same 
" working " process is what we invite 
when we set bread with yeast. It 
will not begin its work until it has 
been given sugar, heat, and moisture. 
It thrives best at 78° Fahrenheit. 
You can make it work more quickly by 
raising the temperature, but when it 
reaches 130° Fahrenheit it is blighted, 
just as a plant dies in an overheated 



YEAST BREADS, DOUGHS AND BATTERS 293 



room. Now you know what happens 
when you set your bread near a hot 
stove or register — the " yeast has 
been killed." It is almost impossible, 
however, to kill yeast with cold. I 
have thawed it very gradually more 
than once after it had been frozen 
and made excellent bread from it. 
You know how slowly bread rises 
after it has been chilled by a cold 
night. Still it will rise, for the 
growth of the yeast was simply 
brought to a standstill. 

In chemistry a name which means 
sugar fungus has been given to yeast. 
It needs, you remember, air as weU 
as moisture to make it grow, hence 
oxygen is required to raise every 
dough or batter; and when sugar is at 
hand, it will supply itself with some 
of the oxygen contained in that. So 
bread recipes frequently call for a 
tablespoonful of sugar. Sugar is not 
a necessity, however, because yeast 
changes the starch in flour into sugar. 
It is needed only when the yeast is 
none too lively and requires a bit of 
help. 

Immediately when yeast goes into 
the batter, — which is the first step in 
bread making, — a chemical change, 
wiiich we call fermentation, begins to 
take place. We help the yeast to be- 
gin work by hard beating of the bat- 
ter, and then by kneading the dough. 
For both of these processes tend 
not only to mix the ingredients 
thoroughly, but also to inclose air; 
the longer the beating and kneading 
the more air is inclosed, and the 
spongier becomes the bread. 

The first step in bread making, as 
in all cookery, is to get together every- 
thing necessary in utensils and ma- 
terials. The utensils needed are a 
bread pan with a close-fitting, ven- 
tilated cover, a measuring cup, a wire 
spoon for beating the batter, a slitted 
wooden spoon to stir with, and a 
molding cloth. 

The molding cloth is a square yard 
of hea%'y duck or sail cloth; this is 
much superior to the smooth surface 
of a wooden molding board, because 
considerable flour can be sifted into 
the rough surface of the fabric. It 
holds the flour and there is no stick- 



ing of soft dough. As the flour works 
into the dough, sift in more, rubbing 
it into the cloth with your hand. 
When you have finished work, shake 
it, fold the cloth, and lay it away un- 
til needed again. It can be used a 
number of times before being washed ; 
but when it has to go to the laundry, 
soak it for an hour in cold water, and 
rinse several times before putting it 
in the suds. Hot water would turn 
the flour into dough; then it would be 
no easy task to get it clean. 

Sift into pan four or five quarts of 
flour, and, unless you are working in 
midsummer, set it either over the 
register or in a moderate oven to 
warm. Cold flour will always retard 
the raising of bread. Scald one jiint 
of milk and pour it into the bread pan 
over two teaspoonfuls of salt. Add 
first a pint of cold water, then one 
yeast cake dissolved in half a cup- 
ful of lukewarm water. To this 
liquid add seven or eight cupfuls of 
warm flour, and beat the batter thor- 
oughly with a wire spoon. Do not 
stop beating until the batter is a mass 
of bubbles. Then take the slitted 
spoon and begin adding more flour till 
you have a soft dough. When it be- 
comes too stiff to stir, dust plenty of 
flour into the molding cloth, rubbing 
it into the fabric till it will hold no 
more. Gather the dough into a ball 
and drop it on the cloth. Now begin 
to knead, folding the edge of the 
dough farthest from you toward the 
center, pressing it ' away with the 
palms, gently yet quickly. The proc- 
ess of kneading has more to do with 
good bread than almost anything else. 
In a cooking school I have seen pieces 
of the same dough, raised in the same 
temperature, baked in the same oven, 
yield two entirely difl'erent qualities 
of bread. One loaf was molded by 
an energetic, strong-muscled girl 
whose kneading was so strenuous 
tliat all the life had been banged out 
of it. The other loaf was kneaded 
by a girl whose every movement was 
grace; who used her hands deftly, 
lightly, and briskly. Her bread was 
as fine as bread could be made, a 
spongy, delicious, well-shaped loaf. 
So remember that it is not brute force 



294 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



that tells in kneading; it is steady, 
light, springy, dexterous movements, 
which distribute the yeast plant 
evenly through the dough and inclose 
all the air it is possible to get in. As 
you work you can see how the air is 
doing its duty, for the dough be- 
comes fuU of little bubbles and blis- 
ters. When it is smooth as satin, 
elastic, does not stick, and is so 
spongy that it rises quickly when you 
dent it with your linger, it is ready 
to set to rise. Wash the bread pan 
and grease it well, even inside the lid; 
this makes the dough slip out clean 
after the next raising. Put on the 
cover and set the pan in a warm 
place. 

As soon as the dough has doubled 
in bulk, turn it out on a slightly 
floured molding cloth and knead into 
loaves. This second kneading is a 
slight one, only enough to prepare it 
for the pans and get rid of any large 
air bubbles which, if left in, would 
mean holes in the bread. Have the 
pans greased, using a butter brush 
which penetrates to every corner. 
Always make small loaves; generally 
the right size can be guessed at by 
having each pan half fuU of dough. 
I like bread baked in the French or 
round bread pans. The crust of it is 
exceedingly good, the loaf cuts into 
neat slices, not a bit of the bread be- 
ing wasted, and it bakes to a nicety 
without any danger of burning. In 
rectangular pans the dough in the 
corner does not have room fully to 
expand. When large brick-shaped 
loaves are made, it is almost impossi- 
ble to bake them to the heart unless 
the crust gets very thick and hard. 
If heat does not penetrate to the cen- 
ter of a loaf, the undercooked dough 
gives good cause for serious indiges- 
tion. 

After the bread is in the pans we 
have to find a place for it to rise. In 
the summer I set it in the window, 
which, of course, is closed, for a 
draught on rising bread hurts it. 
During the winter the bread goes on 
a shelf close to the kitchen chimney, 
behind the stove. The shelf is cov- 
ered with white oilcloth and just wide 
enough for four pans. When set to 



rise, the loaves are covered with 
cloths made from old table linen. 
These are kept laundered and never 
used except on baking days. 

A question I am often asked is: 
" How do you know when bread is 
raised enough to be put in the oven?" 
This is one of the most important 
points about bread making. I might 
tell you to let it rise for an hour, only 
time depends so much upon tempera- 
ture. I might suggest that it be al- 
lowed to become doubled in bulk, but 
even that is not a sure test. The 
only one I ever use is to keep " heft- 
ing " it, as a New England cook 
would say. The loaf will kcc]) on for 
an hour or so being of quite good 
weight, then all of a sudden it feels 
light. Pop it into a hot oven. Strange 
as it may seem, a row of pans filled 
with bread at the same time, which 
have stood in the same temperature, 
wiU seldom " heft " light at the same 
minute. I have seen half an hour of 
difference between the time three or 
four pans were ready to go into the 
oven. 

Nearly every cookbook gives a dif- 
ferent test for the proper heat of 
the oven. It ought to register 360° 
Fahrenheit, but as few cooks use a 
thermometer, you may go by this test: 
Sprinkle a teaspoonful of flour on the 
oven bottom, and if it browns in five 
minutes the oven is just right for the 
bread. If it grows chestnut brown 
in that time, cool the oven or your 
bread will crust too quickly. When 
the loaves are in, watch them; if you 
see one throwing up an awkward 
ridge or hump anywhere, you may 
know that the oven is too hot and 
the bread is rising faster than it 
ought to do. Do not let one loaf 
touch another; the dough will run 
together if they do. Then when they 
are pulled apart, there is not only an 
unsightly loaf, but a heavy streak in 
the bread. If the oven is just right, 
it will stop rising and begin to brown 
after baking fifteen minutes. Then 
cool the oven slightly, and let the bak- 
ing go on moderately till the bread 
has been in for an hour. 

Take out the well-browned loaves, 
turn them immediately out of the 



YEAST BREADS, DOUGHS AND BATTERS 295 



pans, brush over the crust with a but- 
tered brush, and set them to cool on 
a wire stand. If loaves are set flat, 
the bottom will become moist; if they 
are wrapped in a cloth, there is a 
soft, steamy crust. In summer if the 
steam is not allowed to evaporate 
from bread, there is danger of it 
molding, so it must never be put 
away until perfectly cool. The best 
place to store it is in a small, shelved 
closet of japanned ware, with a door 
that closes tight. This is a better and 
handier receptacle than the wooden 
tub or stone jar used in some house- 
holds. Never keep bread in a cellar; 
it is a horribly unwholesome cus- 
tom. 



LITTLE NOTES ABOUT BREAD 
MAKING 

Some cooks prefer to set a sponge 
when making bread, allowing it to rise 
in the shape of a well-beaten batter 
before adding flour enough to do the 
kneading. " Sponging " makes a fine- 
grained bread, but it lengthens the 
time required for making, as two ris- 
ings are needed after the sponge is 
light. 

Bread may be made from water 
alone instead of "half and half," as 
milk and water bread is called. 
Water bread is tougher and sweeter 
and keeps better than that made from 
all milk. 

A good test of whether bread has 
been kneaded enough is to leave it 
on the board or molding cloth for a 
few minutes. When you take it up 
again, if it does not stick it is ready 
to put in the bread pan. 

If you want to make bread in a 
hurry, simply double the amount of 
yeast, that is, if you are using com- 
pressed yeast. It gives no yeasty 
flavor, although brewers' and home- 
made yeast do leave a slight taste 
when more than the prescribed quan- 
tity is used. 

Should the oven be too hot, set a 
pan of cold water in it for a few 
minutes. 

Don't use potatoes or potato water 
m bread. The liquid in which pota- 
toes have been boiled contains a poi- 



sonous alkaloid and it tends to dark- 
en the bread as well as giving it a 
peculiar flavor. Years ago, before 
milling had been brought to perfec- 
tion, there might have been reason for 
adding mashed potatoes to bread; 
now, with our fine flour, there is no 
necessity for it. 

The best way to care for a bread 
box is to wash it in hot water, then 
close it, and dry it on the cool end 
of a stove. This ought to be done 
between each baking to keep it fresh 
and sweet. 

Milk bread browns more quickly 
than water bread; so do not imagine 
because your loaf is a nice chestnut 
brown that it is baked. Give it time 
enough, which is from fifty to sixty 
minutes for brick loaves four inches 
thick. 

If you are detained from getting 
bread into the pans when it has risen 
sufficiently, take a knife and cut down 
the dough till you are ready to attend 
to it. This allows the gas to escape 
and there is no danger of souring if 
you cannot return to it for half an 
hour. 

When kneading light bread if you 
cut dough with a carving knife it 
will break the bubbles and cause the 
bread to be of finer grain. Then, 
too, it will not take so long to work 
it. 

It is best to have your fire in such 
condition that it will need no replen- 
ishing while bread baking is in prog- 
ress. 

Yeast may be kept perfectly fresh 
for at least a week or ten days by 
immersing the cake in cold water. 
The particles of yeast settle at the 
bottom and water acts as a seal from 
the air. Cover the glass in which 
yeast is dissolved and keep it in a 
cellar or refrigerator. Occasionally 
pour oft" the water that covers it and 
add fresh water. 

If you do not own a covered bread 
pan, raise the dough in a large, clean 
bowl or basin, kept well covered with 
a towel. A paper tightly tied down 
is better still, for it prevents air from 
entering. 

When a recipe calls for one com- 
pressed yeast cake and nothing can 



296

be obtained but liquid yeast, use one 
cupful of it instead. 

If you don't have a wire stand for 
cooling bread, simply turn up a cou- 
ple of bread tins and stand the 
loaves against their edges. The idea 
is to let the steam escape, so that 
the bread will neither be heavy nor 
moist. 

If you want to hurry bread slight- 
ly, add one tablespoonful of sugar to 
four quarts of flour. The yeast plant 
begins to grow quicker when there is 
sugar to feed on. When there is no 
sugar, the yeast has to change some 
of the starch to sugar, and, of course, 
this taiies time. 

Pricking the top of a loaf with a 
fork before it is put in the oven tends 
to make it rise and bake evenly. 

Do not try setting bread over 
night either in midsummer or mid- 
winter. In cold weather bread is 
likely to be chilled, in summer it may 
sour. There is plenty of time to raise 
and bake bread in the daytime, when 
one can watch it and give the care- 
ful consideration it requires above 
any other cooking. 

If you live in a region where the 
water is very hard, boil it, and let 
it grow lukewarm before mixing with 
flour, for soft water is better than 
hard in the bread-making process. 

Flour is almost as sensitive to 
odors as is milk; therefore it should 
be kept in a perfectly clean, whole- 
some, dry place. Always raise the 
barrel off the flour, either on two 
strips of wood or on one of the 
handy little contrivances which will 
swing it out and into a cupboard. 
Never use flour for anything without 
sifting it first — it may be perfectly 
free from any foreign substance and 
it may not. 

Water Bread. 

4 cupfuls boiling water, 

4 tablespoonfuls lard, 

1 tablespoonful sugar, 

li teaspoonfuls salt, 

1 yeast cake softened in i cupful 

lukewarm water, 
3 quarts sifted flour. 

Put the lard, sugar, and salt in a 
bread raiser; pour on boiling water; 



when lukewarm, add softened yeast 
cake and 5 cupfuls flour; then stir 
until tlioroughly mixed. Add re- 
maining flour, mix, and knead. Re- 
turn to bowl; let rise over night. In 
the morning cut down, knead, shape 
into loaves or biscuits, place in 
greased pans, having ])ans nearly half 
full. Cover, let raise again, and 
bake. 

Bread. 

3 cupfuls sifted flour, 

1 cupful lukewarm water, 

I cupful yeast, or one-sixth yeast 

cake. 
1 teaspoonful salt, 
1 teaspoonful shortening, 
^ teaspoonful sugar. 

Soften the yeast cake in one-fourth 
cupful of the water with the sugar, 
mix flour and salt together in a mix- 
ing bown. JNIake a hole in the cen- 
ter of the flour, pour in the yeast, stir 
with a wooden spoon, add the rest of 
the water, more if required. It must 
be just stiff enough to knead with 
the hand. Knead either in the bowl 
or on a floured board. Use as little 
flour as possible in kneading, but do 
not let the dough stick to the hands 
or board. When smooth and elastic 
put it back in the bowl, cover with 
a clean cloth and a tin cover, and set 
in warm place (about 80° Fahren- 
heit). It will take four or five hours 
in summer and all night in winter. 
When double its bulk, knead it 
lightly and make into loaves or bis- 
cuit. Let them rise till double their 
size in a warm place. Bake in a hot 
oven, loaves forty to sixty minutes, 
biscuits from ten to twenty minutes. 
When done cover the loaves with a 
cloth and rest them up on end till 
cold. 

Breakfast Buns. 

When putting bread into loaves 
save out one large cupful of dough. 
Place it in a granite pan and let rise 
until it is three times the size of the 
original. Pour over it one cupful of 
cold water, one-half cupful of sugar, 
butter the size of an egg, and mix in 
flour enough to make a stiff dough.

YEAST BREADS, DOUGHS AND BATTERS 297 



Mix well. Cover and let rise five 
hours. Make into small biscuits leav- 
ing plenty of space for each one in 
the i)an. Let rise in buttered pans 
until morning. Bake ten minutes. 
This will make two dozen buns. — 
Mrs. F. E. Dracgert. 

Entire-Wheat Bread. 

4 cupfuls scalded milk, 

i cupful brown sugar, 

IJ teaspoonfuls salt, 

1 yeast cake, 

9 cupfuls entire-wheat flour. 

Put sugar and salt in a bread 
raiser and pour the hot milk over 
them; when cool, add the flour and 
yeast cake, beat hard with a wooden 
spoon for five minutes, cover the pan 
and set in a warm place till the bat- 
ter doubles its bulk. Beat it down, 
turn into greased bread pans, having 
each half full. Let the batter rise 
nearly to the top, then bake. 

Caraway Bread (German recipe). 

Follow the recipe for entire-wheat 
bread, substituting rye flour for en- 
tire-wheat flour and adding 2 table- 
spoonfuls sugar. Make the bread as 
directed at the first kneading, work- 
ing in a tablespoonful of caraway 
seeds. Shape into loaves, raise, and 
bake. 

Graham Bread. 

1 quart Graham flour, 
1 quart white flour, 
1 yeast cake, 
IJ teaspoonfuls salt, 
I cupful brown sugar, 
1 quart milk. 

Scald the milk and pour it over the 
sugar and salt; when lukewarm, stir 
in the flour and the yeast, which has 
been softened in warm water. Beat 
hard and let it rise in the pan till 
spongy. This is a dough which is 
not stiff enough to knead; it simply 
rrcjuires a thorough stirring and licat- 
ing. Put It into greased pans, raise, 
and bake in an oven which is hot at 
first, but cool during the later part 
of the baking process. This dough 



may be used to drop into greased 
gem pans and bake as muffins. 

Graham Bread. 

Set your sponge with white flour 
just exactly as if you were going to 
make white bread. For | of a gal- 
lon of light s[)onge which is the 
amount you should have for 6 medium 
sized loaves, take 8 cups of white 
flour, 4 cups of graham flour, 1 cup 
white sugar and 1 tablespoon of salt. 
Mix these dry ingredients thontughly 
together, then pour in the sponge and 
mix. The dough should not be quite 
as stiff as for white bread. When 
thoroughly kneaded, grease the dough 
with lard and set in a warm place to 
rise. In three hours the dough should 
have doubled in bulk and be ready to 
mold into loaves. Have the baking 
pans well greased, put in the loaves 
and turn so that each loaf will be 
thoroughly greased. Set in a warm 
place to rise again and in li hours it 
should be light enough to bake. Test 
it l)y shaking the pan and if the dough 
shakes easily consider it light. Place 
in a moderately hot oven and bake 1 
hour and 20 minutes. 

Graham flour varies greatly in 
color, and the proportion of ^ gra- 
ham and § white flour should be used 
with the medium grade. If the gra^ 
ham is light in color, more should be 
used, and if darker, less. Do not use 
coarse graham — the finer the graham 
the better the bread. Whole wheat 
flour may be used instead of the gra- 
ham. — Lois Percy. 

Rye Bread. 

2 quarts rye flour, 

1 quart wheat flour, 

1 yeast cake, 

3 pints warm water, 

2 teaspoonfuls salt, 

3 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

Sift the flour with the sugar and 
salt, stir in the warm water and 
softened yeast. When thoroughly 
mixed, begin to work it with your 
hands; it will be sticky, but tlie dough 
must lie kept very soft. When thor- 
oughly beaten, pour it into well-but- 
tered pans and set it in a warm place.

Let it rise to twice its bulk and bake 
an hour in an oven which is a little 
slower than for white bread. Rub 
the crust over with butter to soften 
it as soon as it is taken from the oven. 

Cornmeal Bread. 
2 cupfuls flour, 
§ cupful cornmeal, 
2 cupfuls milk, 
2 cupfuls water, 
1 teaspoonful salt, 

1 yeast cake. 

Put the milk and water in a double 
boiler, and let it get scalding hot; 
then stir in the cornmeal and allow 
it to cook slowly for half an hour. 
Pour it into a bread raiser and when 
lukewarm add the salt and yeast. 
Gradually beat in the flour. Put on 
a cover and set in a warm place to 
raise. When it doubles its bulk, add 
more flour if necessary and work with 
a wooden spoon until it can be han- 
dled. Turn out on a floured molding 
board and knead thoroughly. Mold 
into loaves, put into greased bread 
pans, and set it to rise in a warm 
place. UTien light bake in a mod- 
erate oven for three quarters of an 
hour. 

Squash Bread (German recipe). 

2 cupfuls squash, 
i cupful sugar, 

3 cupfuls scalded milk, 
2 tablespoonfuls butter, 
i teaspoonful salt, 

1 yeast cake, 

Flour enough to knead. 

Press the stewed squash through a 
potato ricer, stir it with the sugar, 
salt, and butter into the hot milk; 
when cool, pour in the softened 
yeast and as much flour as will make 
a dough that can be handled. Turn 
out on a molding board and knead 
for fifteen minutes. Return to the 
bread raiser and let it double its 
bulk. Knead again, shape into 
loaves, raise, and bake. 

Oatmeal Bread. 

i cupful rolled oats, 
1^ cupfuls flour, 



2 cupfuls boiling water, 
1 yeast cake, 
1 tablespoon ful salt, 
1 tablespoonful butter, 
i cupful molasses. 

Put the oatmeal into a bread raiser, 
pour the boiling water over and let 
stand until lukewarm; then add salt, 
butter, softened yeast cake, and 
molasses; stir in the flour, beat thor- 
oughly, and set it to raise in buttered 
bread pans. When it has almost 
doubled its bulk, bake. 

Nut Bread. 

1 cupful entire-wheat flour, 
1 cupful white flour, 
i cake yeast, 

1 cupful milk, 

2 tablespoonfuls brown sugar, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 

i pound shelled hickory nuts. 

Set a sponge of the wheat flour, 
white flour, yeast, and milk; when 
light, add sugar, salt, hickory nuts, 
and enough entire-wheat flour to 
make as stiflf as can be stirred with 
spoon. Put in the pan, raise, and 
bake one hour. 

Bye and Indian Bread. 

2 cupfuls yellow cornmeal, 
i cupful yeast, 

i cupful molasses, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 
i teaspoonful soda, 

2 cupfuls rye meal. 

Put the cornmeal into a mixing 
bowl and scald with boiling water; 
after ten minutes mix to a soft bat- 
ter with cold water. When luke- 
warm, add the yeast, molasses, salt, 
soda, and 2 cupfuls rye meal. Beat 
thoroughly, cover with a pan, and set 
in a warm place to rise over night. 
When the surface cracks open, stir it 
down, then grease and flour a pan, 
turn in the dough, smooth over the 
top, and sprinkle evenly with flour 
to prevent crust from forming. Let 
it rise again until cracks appear, then 
bake it in a moderate oven from two 
to three hours, covering with a tin 
lid after the first hour.

Fruit Bread. 

2 cupfuls sweet milk, 

2 cakes yeast, 

i teaspoonful salt, 

4 tablespoonfuls lard, 

4 tablespoonfuls sugar, 

11 cupfuls fruit, cut fine. 

Flour. 

Scald milk and cool to lukewarm; 
strain in the yeast softened in one 
quarter cupful lukewarm water. Sift 
salt with three cupfuls of flour, beat 
vigorously into liquid, and let sponge 
ri^e. Cream the lard, butter, and 
sugar; dredge the fruit with flour 
and add to the sponge. Add suf- 
ficient flour to make a soft dough. 
Knead thoroughly and set to rise. 
When light, divide, form into loaves, 
put in bread pans, and when ready, 
bake in slightly cooler oven than is 
required for plain bread. For the 
fruit in this bread, use either raisins, 
currants, citron, dates, figs, or pru- 
nelles. 

Bread Made with Dry Yeast. 
2 quarts flour, 
2i cupfuls warm water, 
2 tablespoonfuls lard, 
1 yeast cake, 
1 tablespoonful sugar, 
1 teaspoonful salt. 

Sift the flour in the bread pan; 
break up the yeast cake and put in a 
quart bowl; then add a gill of water, 
and mash with a spoon until the yeast 
and water are well mixed. Beat in 1 
gill of flour. Cover the bowl and set 
in a warm place for two hours. At 
the end of that time the batter should 
be a perfect sponge. Add to the 
sponge a pint of warm water, half 
the lard, also salt and sugar. Stir 
this mixture into the flour and mix 
with a spoon. Sprinkle the board 
with flour, turn out the dough, knead 
twenty minutes, using as little flour 
as possible. At the end of this time 
the ball of dough should be soft, 
smooth, and elastic. Place the dough 
in the bowl and rub the second 
spoonful of butter or lard over it. 
Cover with a towel, then a tin cover. 
Set the bowl in a warm place and 



let it raise over night. In the morn- 
ing the dough will have increased to 
three times its original volume and be 
a perfect sponge. Knead it in the 
bowl for five minutes — do not use 
flour — then shape into three small 
loaves. Put these in deep pans, and 
with a sharp knife cut lengthwise 
through the center of each loaf. Put 
the pans in a warm place and cover 
with a towel. Let the loaves rise to 
twice their size, then bake fifty min- 
utes. 

Sweet-Potato Bread. 
1 cake yeast, 

i cupful lukewarm water, 
1 cupful scalded milk, 
1 tablespoonful salt, 
i cupful sugar, 

1 cupful sweet mashed potatoes, 
3 tablespoonfuls melted butter. 

Soften the yeast in the lukewarm 
water, add the milk, salt, sugar, and 
potatoes (roasted, scraped from the 
skins, and worked to a cream with 
the melted butter), then allow to cool. 
Beat all together imtil light, then 
stir in with a wooden spoon enough 
flour to make a soft dough. Throw 
a cloth over the bread bowl and set 
in a warm place until well raised. 
Make into small loaves; let them rise 
for an hour and bake in a brisk oven. 

Salt-Rising Bread. 

2 cupfuls hot water, 
li teaspoonfuls salt, 

1 pint lukewarm milk. 
Flour. 

Dissolve i teaspoonful salt in hot 
water, and beat in gradually enough 
flour to make a very soft dough. 
Beat for ten minutes, cover, and set 
in a warm place for eight hours or 
until light and spongy. Stir the salt 
into the milk and add enough flour 
to make a stifif batter before working 
it into the raised dough; mix thor- 
oughly, cover, and set again in a warm 
place to rise until very light. Knead 
in enough flour to make the batter of 
the consistency of ordinary bread 
dough. Make into loaves and set 
them to rise; when light, bake. There

is always an element of chance in 
Salt-Rising Bread. Sometimes the 
sponge will rise and sometimes it will 
not. 

To insure success with salt-rising 
bread in cold weather, keep the night 
yeast in a box of hay. A small 
wooden box with a close-fitting lid is 
best for this purpose. Put hay into 
the bottom of the box and around the 
sides. In the middle of this set your 
yeast, then cover with hay. This will 
keep the j'east from ?, chill. Good 
bread will be the result. 

SMALL BREADS MADE FROM 
YEAST 

Stockholm Bread (Swedish recipe). 
Gl cupfuls flour, 
1 yeast cake, 
2i cupfuls scalded milk, 
i cupful melted butter, 
1 egg, 

§ cupful sugar, 
i teaspoonful salt, 
1 teaspoonful cinnamon. 

Scald 1 cupful milk; when luke- 
warm, soften the yeast cake in it. 
Beat in 1 cupful flour and let the 
sponge rise till light; add the rest 
of the milk with 4 cupfuls flour, beat 
again and allow it to rise. Then add 
the butter, sugar, cinnamon, salt, and 
the egg beaten to a froth, also the re- 
mainder of the flour. Mix and knead 
on a floured molding board. Cover 
and raise. Roll the dough into coils 
about an inch and a half thick and 
twelve inches long. Braid them, 
pinch the ends together, set in a 
greased pan to rise, and bake in a 
moderate oven. Cool slightly, then 
brush with powdered sugar moistened 
with boiling water and slightly fla- 
vored with cinnamon. 

Federal Bread. 
1 quart milk, 
1 teaspoonful salt, 
1 yeast cake, 

1 tablespoonful melted butter, 
3 eggs. 

Scald the milk and add to it the 
butter and salt; when cool, pour in 



the yeast cake softened in 2 table- 
spoonfuls of lukewarm water and 
beat in enough flour to make a 
dough that is softer than for bread. 
Pour into a shallow pan and raise 
over night; bake in the morning. 
When taken from the oven, split it 
shortcake fashion, butter generously, 
and serve hot. This is an excellent 
hot bread to make for breakfast, be- 
cause, unless the weather is unusually 
warm, the cook will find it just in 
proper condition to bake when break- 
fast is required. 

Rice Bread. 

i pound boiled rice, 
•2 quarts flour, 
i yeast cake, 

2 cujifuls milk, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 

3 teaspoonfuls sugar. 

Mash the rice while hot and rub it 
into the flour with the tijjs of the 
fingers. Add the salt and sugar, 
warm milk, and softened yeast. 
I\Iake it into a dough just soft 
enough to handle, knead well, and 
pUice in a well greased shallow pan. 
Let it double its bulk, and bake in a 
hot oven. 

Parker House Rolls. 
7 cupfuls flour, 
1 teaspoonful salt, 
1 tablespoonful sugar, 
3 tablespoonfuls butter, 
1 pint milk, 
1 yeast cake. 

Put 4 cupfuls flour into a mixing 
bowl with the salt, sugar, and butter; 
pour on the milk, scalding hot, and 
beat thoroughly; allow it to cool, then 
add the yeast softened in 3 table- 
spoonfuls of lukewarm water and let 
the sponge raise till frothy; put in 
the rest of the flour, mix thoroughly, 
and knead. Raise again, then turn 
out on a molding board and shape 
into Parker House rolls. The way to 
make tliese rolls is to cut oflF a small 
ball of dough and roll it flat and 
thin. Brush over the top with melt- 
ed butter, cut across the middle, but 
not quite through the dough, with 



YEAST BREADS, DOUGHS AND BATTERS 301 



the back of a silver knife. Fold over 
and lay nearly double, then press 
down to make the dough adhere; al- 
low them to rise. I3ake fifteen min- 
utes in a hot oven, and brush with 
melted butter. 

Swiss Rolls. 

2 cupfuls milk, 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar, 
I cupful butter. 

1 cake yeast, 
IJ quarts flour, 
1 teaspoonful salt. 

Scald the milk and melt the sugar 
and butter; when lukewarm, add the 
softened yeast. Stir in the flour and 
set in a warm place to raise. Turn 
out on a floured bread board, roll till 
an inch thick, brusli the top over with 
melted butter, and roll up the sheet 
of dough like a rolled jelly cake. 
Press it lightly into shape and cut 
from the end slices about an inch 
thick; put the slices, cut side up, into 
a greased pan and let rise until they 
have doubled in height. Bake in a 
hot oven twenty minutes, and brush 
over with melted butter. 

Hot Cross Buns. 
1 pint milk, 
^ cupful butter, 
i cupful sugar, 

3 eggs, 

i teaspoonful salt, 
1 yeast cake. 
Flour. 

Scald the milk and pour it over the 
butter and salt; when lukewarm, add 
the yeast softened in 2 tablespoonfuls 
of lukewarm water and eggs well 
beaten, tlien sift in flour enough to 
make a thin batter, and beat with a 
wire whisk ten minutes; when full of 
bubbles, add flour enough to make a 
dough; knead well and raise. When 
it has doubled its bulk, turn it out, 
knead it and cut into buns. Place 
them in a greased pan to rise, brush 
them over when ready to go into the 
oven with a sirup made of 1 table- 
spoonful cream and 2 tablespoonfuls 
sugar boiled together for a minute. 
Dust with cinnamon and just before 



putting in the oven cut two gashes in 
the top with a sharp knife. By add- 
ing raisins or currants to this recipe 
you can have very nice fruit buns. 
If you wish to transform them into 
prune kringles, chop 6 or 8 meaty 
prunes, which have been cooked and 
sweetened, add to the dough, let rise, 
and, instead of baking them bun 
shape, cut into sticks. 

Yorkshire Sally lunn (English rec- 
ipe). 
2 quarts flour, 

1 yeast cake, 

2 eggs, 

1 cupful butter, 

1 tablespoonful sugar, 
i teaspoonful salt, 

2 cupfuls milk. 

Warm the flour, add the milk luke- 
warm, the melted butter, beaten eggs, 
sugar and salt, then the softened 
yeast cake. 6eat thoroughly. This 
makes a very soft dough, but it must 
be kneaded; therefore, add a little 
more flour, as it is difficult to handle. 
Cut into small balls; drop each one 
into a greased muffin pan, raise, brush 
over with white of egg, and bake till 
delicately brown. When taken from 
the oven, brush with a sirup made 
from milk and sugar. Serve hot. 

Apple Cake (Dutch recipe). 
1 cupful milk, 
i cupful sugar, 
^ cupful butter, 
i teaspoonful salt, 

1 yeast cake, 

2 eggs. 
Flour, 

5 apples, 

4 tablespoonfuls sugar, 

i tablespoonful cinnamon. 

Scald the milk, pour it over the 
butter, sugar, and salt; when luke- 
warm, add the eggs, softened yeast 
cake, and enough flour to make a soft 
dough. Beat it thoroughly and set in 
a warm place to raise. Beat again 
and let it rise a second time. Then 
pour into a sliallow greased pan, 
spread the dough out thin with a 
palette knife, and brush over the top

with melted butter. Pare the apples, 
core, and cut into eighths. Lay them 
thickly on top of the dough in 
straight rows. Dust sugar and cinna- 
mon over them, cover with a towel, 
set in a warm place, and let the 
dough raise until doubled. Bake in 
a moderate oven half an hour, cut 
into squares and serve hot, with 
whipped, sweetened cream. 

Entire-Buckwheat Cakes. 
'2 cupfuls warm milk, 
i cake yeast, 
1 teaspoonful salt, 
Buckwheat flour, 
1 teaspoonful soda, 
i cupful boiling water, 

1 tablespoonful molasses. 

The general idea is that you have 
to mix buckwheat with white flour to 
make good cakes, but they are excel- 
lent made with buckwheat alone. 
Pour the milk into a mixing bowl, 
add the softened yeast, and stir in as 
much buckwheat flour as will make 
a medium batter, then add the salt 
and molasses, and let the batter stand 
over night. In the morning, when 
ready to bake, dissolve the soda in 
boiling water, stir it in, beat for a 
few minutes, then make your cakes. 
Turn them just once. 

Luncheon Holls. 

2 cupfuls sifted flour, 
i cupful milk, 

1 tablespoonful butter, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 

2 teaspoonfuls sugar, 
1 cake yeast. 

Soften the yeast in lukewarm milk, 
add sugar and salt, then add the 
butter, melted. Stir milk into flour 
gradually. Knead the dough thor- 
oughly, adding sufficient flour to make 
a soft dough. Cut and form into 
rolls, place in buttered biscuit pans, 
set in a warm place to rise, when 
doubled bake in a brisk oven. 

Buckwheat Cakes. 

1 cake yeast, 

2 cupfuls lukewarm milk, 

1 tablespoonful wheat flour, 



1 tablespoonful molasses, 

i teaspoonful salt, 

1 quart buckwheat flour. 

Soften the yeast in the milk. Rub 
together the flour, molasses, and salt; 
add to this the milk containing the 
yeast, and rub until perfectly smooth, 
then stir in two cupfuls lukewarm 
milk or water. To this add sufficient 
buckwheat flour to make a thin batter, 
which should be rubbed perfectly 
smooth. Set the batter in a moder- 
ately warm place to rise over night. 
In the morning thin, if necessary, and 
fry on well-greased griddle. 

Kaised Batter Cakes. 

1 cake yeast, 

2 cupfuls milk, 
2 cupfuls flour, 

4 tablespoonfuls melted lard, 
4 tablespoonfuls sirup, 
Dash salt. 

Soften the yeast in lukewarm milk. 
Put into mixing bowl the melted lard, 
sirup, salt, milk and flour. Add the 
softened yeast, and mix until a 
smooth batter is produced. Set in a 
moderately warm place, cover with a 
cloth, and let it rise over night. In 
the morning beat well, and fry on 
well-greased griddle. 

English Bath Buns. 
4 cupfuls flour, 
i cupful butter, 

4 eggs, 

5 tablespoonfuls granulated 
sugar, 

i cupful milk, 
1 cake yeast. 

Put flour in bowl, make well in 
center, break eggs in whole, then add 
butter, milk, and, last, the yeast, 
which has been previously softened in 
a little warm water. Mix thoroughly 
and raise. If it is put in a moderate- 
ly warm place, it will be light in 
an hour. Turn it out on a well- 
floured board, and with the tips of 
the fingers lightly work in 5 table- 
spoonfuls sugar and add the flavor- 
ing. Drop by tablespoonfuls on a 
buttered baking pan, raise for ten

bake twenty minutes in a hot oven. 
Sultanas or chopped almonds may be 
added. 

Lancashire Tea Cakes. 

6 cupfuls flour, 
i cupful butter, 
2 cupfuls milk, 

1 yeast cake, 

1 cupful currants, 

2 ounces candied lemon, 
2 eggs, 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar, 
A little grated nutmeg. 

Put the sugar and the currants 
with the flour; melt the butter in the 
milk; when cool, mix with the beaten 
eggs and yeast. Add the dry in- 
gredients, beating well, and set to 
raise. When light, put in cake pans 
to double its bulk. Bake in a mod- 
erately hot oven. These are delicious 
when fresh, and equally good split 
and toasted the second day. 

Swedish Rolls. 

1 yeast cake, 

2 cupfuls milk, scalded, 
i cupful butter, 

i cupful sugar, 

1 scant teaspoonful salt, 

Whites of 2 eggs, 

7 or 8 cupfuls flour. 

Melt the butter, dissolve the sugar

ter to it and cool until lukewarm. 
Soften the yeast in a little lukewarm 
water, add to the lukewarm milk and 
butter, pour onto the flour mixture 
and beat well. Cover the bowl and 
set in a cool place over night. In the 
morning the batter will be a light 
sponge. Beat the egg and add to 
this sponge. Half fill buttered muffin 
pans with the batter; cover, and let

Broiche (French recipe). 
4 cupfuls flour, 
^ yeast cake, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar, 
7 eggs, 

1 cupful butter, 
Warm water. 

Sift the flour; into 1 cupful of it 
pour the soaked yeast with just 
enough warm water to make a bat- 
ter. Set it to raise. When it has 
doubled its bulk, put in the salt, 
sugar, melted butter, and 4 eggs. 
Beat five minutes, add another egg, 
beat again, and so on until all have 
been used; keep beating until the 
paste leaves the side of the bowl, 
then set in a warm place for four 
hours. Turn it out on a floured 
board, roll in a long piece half an 
inch thick, spread with softened but- 
ter, and fold one end over the center, 
then the other end over that, until 
you have three layers. Cut off pieces 
about an inch wide, lay them on the 
board to raise, and cover with a 
towel. When puffy, take each strip 
between the fingers and thumbs, twist 
in different directions, coil pyramid 
shape, letting one point come on top. 
Set to raise on a greased pan, bake 
twenty minutes, and brush over with 
powdered sugar, moisten with water, 
and flavor with cinnamon. 

Kreuznach Horns (German recipe). 
4 cupfuls flour, 

1 yeast cake, 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar, 
2 eggs, 

J cupful water, 



1 cupful milk, 

i teaspoonful salt. 

Set a sponge with 2 cupfuls flour 
with the yeast cake and milk. When 
it rises, make into a dough with the 
rest of the flour, adding the butter, 
sugar, eggs, and salt. Let it rise 
again. Roll it out into pieces six 
inches square and quite thin. Cut 
each square into four triangles, brush 
with melted butter, dust lightly with 
flour, roll up from the wide side, let- 
ting the point of the triangle come 
on top and bend around in the form 
of a horseshoe. Put them to rise in a 
greased pan when ready to bake, 
brush over with milk, and bake in a 
hot oven. 

Raised Doughnuts. 

2 cupfuls bread dough, 
1 cupful sugar, 

1 tal3lespoonful melted butter, 
i teaspoonful nutmeg, 

2 eggs. 
Flour. 

When the dough for a baking of 
bread rises the last time in the pan 
and is kneaded out on the board, cut 
off a piece large enough to fill a pint 
measure, put in a bowl, add all the 
ingredients called for in the recipe 
and work them into the spongy 
mass, sifting in flour as needed to 
make it of a consistency that can be 
rolled. When thoroughly blended, 
turn it out on the board, dredge with 
flour, and roll about three quarters 
of an inch thick. Cut into fingers or 
rings with a doughnut cutter and 
spread them out on the board to rise. 
When puffy, fry in hot fat, turning 
so they will be browned all over. 
Drain from the kettle and toss im- 
mediately in powdered sugar. A fa- 
vorite breakfast in New England is 
the bread dough, taken without any 
addition of sugar, eggs, or spices, cut 
into strips, raised, and fried like 
doughnuts, then eaten hot with maple 
sirup.

butter, and lay the other one on top 
of it. Bake until crisp, brown, and 
puffy. Split and between the cake

raspberries, cherries, fresh apricots, 
oranges, or a blend of oranges and 
bananas, while a shortcake filled 
with stewed prunes or well-seasoned 
apple sauce is not to be despised.

filling. In every case, have it juicy 
by letting the fruit stand covered 
with sugar for an hour in a cool 
place before it is served.

cris}) and delicately brown, and if 
they do not seem quite hard enough, 
set the cakes in the oven until thor- 
oughly dried out. 

BREADS MADE FROM SOUR MILK 

Milk or cream used for baking is 
best when it sours quickly and does 
not separate, but remains thick and 
smooth. The usual measurement to 
use in every recipe where lightness 
is desired is 1 level teaspoonful soda 
to 2 cupfuls sour milk or 1 cupful 
molasses. Sometimes the milk is 
sour, but not loppered; then use it in 
gingerbread or brown bread, where 
there is molasses enough to complete 
the acidity, or let it stand for a few 
hours in a warm place to lopper. 
The more acid the milk is, the more 
soda it will require. Never use milk 
which has turned bitter or moldy. If 
you are lucky enough to possess sour 
cream, cut down in each recipe 2 
tablespoonfuls butter to 1 cupful 
sour milk, else the mixture will be 
too rich. 

Woodlawn Brown Bread. 

2 cupfuls sour milk,

Add the salt, pour in the molasses, 
. milk, beaten egg, and the soda dis- 
solved in a little water. If you de- 
sire bread that is not very dark or 
sweet, use 2 tablespoonfuls molasses 
and 1 teaspoonful sugar. Steam for 
two and a half-hours in pound bak- 
ing-powder can. Give it three hours 
if steamed in a quart pail.

RECIPES FOR CORN BREAD 

Indian corn is a native of the new 
world and is one of the chief sources 
of national wealth. It is so com- 
monly used as an article of food, 
both in an unripe state, as green corn, 
and as a dry grain, crushed or 
ground as hominy, or as corn meal, 
and cooked in various forms that it 
may almost be regarded as the na- 
tional food of America. In addition 
to corn meal mush, tlie well known 
" hasty pudding " of our grandmoth- 
ers, it forms the basis of many of the 
appetizing modern breakfast foods. 
In New England it takes the form 
best known as the Rhode Island 
Johnny Cake. In the South it forms 
the celebrated Hoe Cake or Corn 
Pone. In all parts of the country 
com meal bread muffins, and batter 
cakes are cooked and served accord- 
ing to a great variety of recipes. 
The following have been selected as 
typical of the various corn meal 
breads in use in different parts of 
the United States as recorded by the 
foremost writers on coolvery. 

Rhode Island Johnny Cake. 

Any kind of corn meal can be sub- 
stituted in the following recipes, but 
the flavor of the true Rhode Island 
Johnny Cake cannot be realized with- 
out meal made from well seasoned 
white (not yellow) corn ground 
nearly as fine as flour. This is 
known to the trade as bolted white 
Indian meal. It is packed in small 
cloth bags by certain manufacturers 
and can be obtained from grocers in 
most parts of the United States if 
specially requested. The process of 
making Johnny Cakes is most simple. 
Measure in a mixing bowl a quantity 
of meal sufficient for the needs of 
the family, which can be determined 
only by experience, and add boiling 
water in a thin stream, stirring vig- 
orously until the dough is nearly, but 
not quite, soft enough to pour. It 
should be very wet but firm. Stir in 
salt to taste and fry with butter, or 
any suitable fat, on a hot griddle 
until a crisp brown crust is formed 
on both sides. The cakes are usually 
formed of a single mixing spoonful 



BAKING-POWDER BREADS, DOUGHS, BATTERS 317 



of dough and flattened so as to be 
about three or four inches across and 
an inch or less in thickness. They 
are best relished by most persons 
when the crust is firm and brittle and 
the interior soft and moist. A little 
experience will enable any one to 
make Johnny Cake dough of the 
right consistency. Some cooks prefer 
to use no more hot water than is 
necessary to thoroughly scald the 
meal and then thin the dough to the 
desired consistency with fresh or 
skimmed milk. Made by either rec- 
ipe Rhode Island Johnny Cakes are 
most wholesome and delicious. 

Southern Johnny Cake. 

Stir together 3 cupfuls of Indian 
meal, 1 of flour, J of molasses and 
a little salt, with enough sour or but- 
termilk to make a stilf batter. Stir 
in 1 teaspoonful of soda and bake in 
a hot oven. — Wm. H. Lee. 

Mrs. Jake's Hoe Cakes. 

Take 1 pint of white corn meal, J 
teaspoonful salt, and 1 teaspoonful of 
sugar. Mix well and add suflBcient 
boiling milk or water to scald. (Add 
2 eggs, or not, as desired.) The bat- 
ter should be thick enough not to 
spread when put on the griddle. 
Grease the griddle, with bacon- 
fat or lard, and drop the batter upon 
it from spoon. Flatten the cakes un- 
til about ^ inch in thickness. Cook 
slowly but do not burn. AVTien of a 
brown color on underside turn over 
and brown other side. Spread a 
little butter on each cake. Serve im- 
mediately when done. — Wm. H. 
Lee. 

Southern Corn Pone. 

Sift a quart of white corn meal, 
add a teaspoonful of salt. Pour on 
enough cold water to make a mixture 
which will squeeze easily through the 
fingers. Work it to a soft dough. 
Mold it into oblong cakes an inch 
thick at the ends and a little thicker 
in the center. Slap them down on the 
pan and press them a little. These 
cakes they say must show the 
marks of the fingers. The pan must 
be hot and sprinkled with the bran 



sifted from the meal. Bake in a hot 
oven for about 20 minutes. — Mary 
Roland. 

Southern Hoe Cake No. 1. 

Make the same mixture as for pone. 
Spread it on the greased hoe, or a 
griddle, making a round cake i of an 
inch thick. Bake it on the top of the 
range, turning and baking it brown 
on both sides. — Mary Roland. 

Southern Hoe Cake No. 2. 

Use for these cakes if possible 
coarse water-ground white meal. 
Add to a quart of meal a tea- 
spoonful of salt; pour over it 
enough boiling water to make a 
soft dough. Add also a little milk 
to make it brown better. Let it 
stand an hour or longer then work it 
together with the hand. Form it into 
little cakes an inch thick and bake 
on a greased griddle till brown on 
both sides. Serve very hot. They 
are split and spread with butter when 
eaten. — Mary Roland. 

Genuine Johnny Cake. 

Eight heaping tablespoonfuls fine 
sifted corn meal, 1 teaspoonful 
sugar. Stir in enough sweet milk 
to make a thin batter. Bake in 
smoking hot iron gem pan, in very 
hot oven, until " golden brown." — 
Mary Lewis. 

Aunt Anne's Hoe Cake. 

Take a large cupful of com 
meal, sift it in a bowl, with a pinch of 
salt. Mix it with a little boiling 
water. Let it get cold. Make some 
small round cakes, pinch them on top. 
Put in a pan to bake in the oven. — 
Celestine Eustis. 

Corn Pone. 

Corn pone is highly recommended 
as a breakfast dish. Take a heap- 
ing colfee-cupful of boiled hominy, 
heat it and thin in a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, 3 eggs and nearly 
1 pint of sweet milk. As much corn 
meal may be added as will serve to 
thicken this till it is like the batter 
for " Johnny Cakes." Bake in a quick 
oven and serve. — Celestine Eustis.

CHAPTER XXIV 
STALE BREAD AND HOW TO UTILIZE IT 

USES OF STALE BREAD, BREWIS, CRUMBS, STEAMED BREAD, 
TOAST, ROULETTES, CROQUETTES, ETC., ETC. 



A careful housewife plans to keep 
in stock the smallest amount possible 
of stale bread, and of that stock not 
a morsel is consigned to the garbage 
pail. There is economy in adopting 
the English fashion of bread cut- 
ting, placing the loaf on a wooden 
trencher with a keen knife, and out- 
ing at the table each slice as it is 
required. 

Look carefully to the stale-bread 
remains of each day. Keep a wire 
basket, set in a tin pan in the pantry, 
to receive all scraps left on plates, 
toast crusts, or morsels from the 
bread jar. Never put them in a cov- 
ered pail or jar; they will mold. 
Save all soft inside parts of a loaf to 
be used as soon as possible for crou- 
tons or croustades, slices or cubes for 
toast and toast points, soft scraps 
for meat and fish dressings, pud- 
dings, omelets, scalloped dishes, grid- 
dlecakes, souffles, croquettes, and the 
numerous dishes for which stale 
bread may be utilized. 

To preserve bread crumbs put 
them in a paper bag and hang 
where the fresh air can get to them. 
They will not mold as they do in a 
jar. 

For stuffing for poultry, fish, 
spareribs, veal, or game it is often 
possible to use dry "heels" and 
crusts by soaking and adding to them 
a portion of dry crumbs. The scraps 
which can be used in no other way 
may be saved for crumbing. When 
the basket becomes full, put the 
bread m a pan and set in a moderate 
oven with the door open. The 



319 



browner the crumbs are, which are 
used as a covering for croquettes, 
etc., the less frying they will stand. 
Before a croquette rolled in very 
brown crumbs is heated to the heart, 
it will appear almost burned. 
Hence, never allow these crusts to 
grow more than a golden brown. 
When the scraps of bread are thor- 
oughly dry, roll them on a board or 
put through the meat chopper, using 
the finest knife. 

If there are children in the family 
who like "rusk," the old-fashioned 
New England name for browned 
crumbs sprinkled into cold milk, re- 
serve the coarser crumbs for this 
purpose. Sift through a fine sieve, 
and reserve the fine crumbs, no 
larger than cornmeal, to be put away 
for crumbing purposes. Save the 
rusk in the same way, keeping it al- 
ways uncovered. If the air is not 
allowed free circulation into the can, 
the crumbs will spoil. When rusk is 
used, heat it slightly in the oven. 
After croquettes have been crumbed, 
scrape together all the fine crumbs 
left on the board and sift, returning 
what is dry to the can. 

Bread crumbs are always prefer- 
able to cracker crumbs in covering 
anything which has been dipped in 
egg. Cracker crumbs do not brown 
well. In the recipes following, stale 
bread and crumbs are spoken of in 
a distinctive fashion. Dried bread 
crumbs are those which are rolled 
and sifted, suitable for crumbing, 
but not for use in puddings or scal- 
lops, for they would absorb too much

moisture. Stale crumbs are made 
from odds and ends of stale bread, 
rubbed on a grater or crumbled fine. 
They must be used at once or they 
will mold. 

Stale bread that is broken and un- 
sightly can be used for brewis, bread 
puddings, or in scallops. Toast or 
steam all that can possibly be used 
in such a way. Remove crusts be- 
fore toasting. It makes a dish more 
sightly, and the crusts can be dried 
for crumbs or worked into a dress- 
ing. Slices of bread too ragged to be 
toasted may be trimmed into dia- 
monds, fingers, oblongs, rounds, or 
triangles for canapes. Cut smaller 
pieces in dice, narrow strips, or 
squares for croutons. Fry forty sec- 
onds in hot fat, or butter lightly and 
brown in the oven. They are an 
attractive accompaniment for thick 
soups. 

Toast that will cut into Vandykes 
or long points can be utilized for sur- 
rounding dishes of spinach, Brussels 
sprouts, asparagus, or green vege- 
tables served in a mold. Dishes au 
gratin will use any of the dry bread 
crumbs. 

Brewis, steamed bread, and toasts 
in a large variety are some of the 
changes to ring in the daily menu, 
and they can be made so appetizing 
that a family has no suspicion it is 
aiding to keep the bread jar in good 
condition. 

Buttered Crumbs. 

Instead of dotting crusts or bread 
crumbs with morsels of butter, melt 
the butter in an omelet pan, 2 table- 
spoonfuls butter to A cupful crumbs, 
and toss lightly with a fork till every 
morsel is buttered. 

Brown-Bread Brewis. 

2 cupfuls stale broviTi bread, 
1 cupful stale white bread, 
I tablespoonful butter, 
2i cupfuls milk. 

For this dish use the smallest odds 
and ends of the bread, crumbling the 
larger portions into inch pieces. Put 
the' butter in a spider. Allow it to 
melt, but not brown, and put in the 



bread. Pour the milk over it and 
simmer, stirring occasionally to keep 
the bread from sticking to the pan. 
Season with a dash of salt and white 
pepper. Serve hot. 

Steamed Bread. 

Into the middle of a large steamer 
with a close-fitting lid set a cup or 
bowl inverted and around it arrange 
slices of stale bread you wish to 
steam. Do not allow them to touch 
the side of the steamer or they will 
become water-soaked. Fit the steam- 
er tightly into the mouth of a kettle 
of boiling water. The bread will be 
ready in a few minutes. In taking 
it out, turn the lid over instantly to 
prevent water dripping on the bread. 
Butter each slice and arrange on a 
hot plate with a napkin over them. 
Stale biscuit or rolls may be steamed 
in the same fashion, or sprinkled 
with cold water and set for a few 
minutes into a hot oven. 

Toasted Sandwiches. 

Often after a picnic or entertain- 
ment a housewife has a number of 
bread-and-butter sandwiches left, too 
stale to serve. They may form the 
basis of a bread pudding or they 
make an attractive dish for break- 
fast, luncheon, or supper in the shape 
of toasted sandwiches. Do not take 
them apart, lay them between the 
wires of a toaster, and hold over a 
clear, red fire. The butter will melt 
and the inside be left soft, warm, 
and buttered, with the outside a crisp, 
golden brown. 

Toast. 

Trim the crust from stale slices 
you wish to toast and move it care- 
fully over a clear, red fire for two 
minutes. Then turn it over and let 
all the moisture be drawn out of the 
bread. Butter and serve immediate- 
ly. Toast may be utilized, especially 
for breakfast, in all sorts of ways. 
Plain toast is a favorite in most 
households; then there are milk toast, 
cream toast, dropped eggs on toast, 
water toast, and the excellent dish of 
bread soaked in egg and milk which 
has all sorts of names, French, 



STALE BREAD 



321 



Spanish, German, and Scotch toast, 
but more proiierly egged toast. At 
the luncheon and dinner table toast 
appears in all forms — under 
chicken and with such vegetables as 
asparagus and spinach; under minced 
meats, fricassees, and creamed mix- 
tures, or in the delicate canape. 

Dry Toast. 

Cut stale bread into slices § inch 
thick, put in toast rack, place 
where heat is sufficient to dry 
out bi-ead. Turn occasionally. When 
dried out, increase the heat sufficient- 
ly to turn the surface a golden brown. 
— Mrs. A. J. Mielke. 

Spider Browned Toast. 

Take several slices of Stale bread 
cut rather thick, cut off the crust 
and butter them on both sides. Lay 
them in a dry, hot spider over a 
rather slow fire and cover with a 
tight lid. When one side has 
browned delicately, turn and brown 
the other. They will be crisp out- 
side, yet soft inside. 

Sandwiches in Cream Sauce. 

Sandwiches left over are not usu- 
ally inviting, but they may be made 
so by this method. Toast them deli- 
cately in the oven, and to every four 
sandwiches made from chicken, veal, 
or tongue make a white sauce with 1 
tablespoonful flour, ^ teaspoonful 
salt, a dash of pejiper, and 1 cupful 
milk cooked until thick. Then add 
the yolk of 1 egg, well beaten. Pour 
this over the sandwiches and serve at 
once. 

White-Bread Brewis. 

Heat a pint of milk in a double 
boiler. Stir into it enough bits of 
stale wheat bread to absorb all the 
milk. Season with a little butter and 
salt. It should not be pasty or slop- 
py, but should be a light, dry por- 
ridge. It is a favorite with children, 
especially if served on a small, pretty 
saucer and dotted with bits of bright 
jelly. Serve hot. 

Bread-Crumb Buckwheat Cakes.

inches wide and the length of the 
slice. Beat the egg slightly, add the 
milk. Dip the bread in the mixture. 
Put the oil in a spider and allow it to 
grow hot. Drop the bread in and 
saut6 till brown. Drain on soft pa- 
per. Arrange log-cabin fashion, and 
serve with a sweet liquid sauce or 
maple sirup.

golden brown. Heat the milk in the 
double boiler, add the butter, and 
when scalding hot, the cornstarch 
moistened in cold milk. Cook 10 
minutes. Lay the toast on a hot plat- 
ter and baste each slice with the 
sauce. Serve very hot. 

Three teaspoonfuls of flour may be 
substituted for the cornstarch and 
will give a less pasty sauce. 

Brown-Bread Saut6. 

Cut the crusts off around slices of 
Boston brown bread with a large 
cooky cutter. Fry bacon in a spider

CHAPTER XXV 

SANDWICHES FOR PICNICS, RECEPTIONS 
AND OTHER ENTERTAINMENTS 



THE MODERN SANDWICH — BREAD FOR SANDWICHES — CHEESE 
SANDWICHES — MEAT SANDWICHES — FRUIT AND VEGE- 
TABLE SANDWICHES — SWEET SANDWICHES, ETC., ETC. 



The old-fashioned sandwich — two 
thick wedges of bread, erratically 
buttered, hard of crust, exuding mus- 
tard, and with frills of ham or corned 
beef appearing about the edge — has 
been relegated to the past by the ar- 
rival of the meat chopper. Formerly 
sandwiches were of a half-dozen va- 
rieties only. The filling of a modern 
sandwich is limited only by what you 
have on hand. Fish, flesh, fowl, vege- 
tables, eggs, nuts, olives, fruit, cheese, 
pickles and many other things are 
utilized alone, or combined, and the 
result, when prepared by a skillful 
cook, is a dainty and delicious morsel. 

If many sandwiches are required, 
as for a reception or picnic, bake the 
bread specially for them; there is less 
waste and the work is much easier. 
Keep on hand plenty of baking-pow- 
der cans, pound and half-pound 
sizes, also a few oblong tins which 
have held one pound of cocoa and 
use them instead of the ordinary 
bread tins. Nothing can excel these 
as molds for baking bread for pic- 
nic sandwiches. Such bread is ten- 
der, almost crustless, needs no trim- 
ming to make two slices accord in 
size, and bakes or steams much more 
quickly than that baked in larger 
tins. 

Make the bread twenty-four hours 
before it is required and have it fine 
grained. Fill the cans half full of 
dough and set to raise. When almost 
at the top of the tins, put to bake 
with the lids off. Fill three quarters 



full of brown-bread mixture; it does 
not raise so much as bread which has 
yeast in it. Slip the small loaves out 
of the tins as soon as taken from 
the oven or steamer and set on a 
wire stand to cool; then wrap in tow- 
els and put away in the bread box 
until required. 

The next consideration is butter. 
Put a pound of butter (if you have 
many sandwiches to make) in a mix- 
ing bowl and with a wooden spoon 
beat it to a fine, light cream, exactly 
as for cake making. The butter is 
much easier to spread, it is more 
economical, and it is ready to divide 
into portions and blend with anything 
to make what is called a flavored but- 
ter, the most delicious of all fillings. 

Before preparing sandwiches, if 
they are to be used at a luncheon or 
entertainment where other dishes ac- 
company them, be careful that the 
flavoring is different from the salad 
with which they are served. It is 
really in better taste to offer nothing 
with a salad or cold meat except 
plain bread and butter sandwiches. 
Fish, lobster, or shrimp salads are 
most appetizing with sandwiches of 
Boston brown bread holding a tender 
lettuce leaf or a sprig of watercress 
dipped in mayonnaise. Serve sand- 
wiches of mild cheese, flavored by 
mustard or tarragon, with green 
salads. White-bread sandwiches hold- 
ing tender young nasturtium leaves 
between tlie buttered folds go well 
with salads of meat or fish. Gar- 



323 



su 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



nish a plateful of this variety with 
a few nasturtium leaves and blossoms. 
Finely cut peppergrass, chives, en- 
dive or celery are all fitting accom- 
paniments to sandwiches which are 
oflFered with a meat or chicken salad. 
Crisp cucumbers and tomatoes thinly 
sliced and spread with mayonnaise 
make a delicious bite between but- 
tered bread. Cut with a small cooky 
cutter rounds of bread slightly larger 
than a slice of tomato or cucumber, 
and put the vegetable between them. 
These, as well as herb sandwiches, 
must not be made until immediately 
before serving. 

Cheese may be spread between 
folds of white, Graham, or entire- 
wheat bread, or delicate crackers. 
Roquefort, fromage de Brie, or any 
of the stronger cheeses should be 
flavored with finely chopped olives or 
parsley and creamed butter. Cora- 
bine with a milder cheese chopped 
olives, walnut meats, anchovy essence, 
a dash of mustard, tabasco sauce, 
and salt. Grate hard cheese or mash 
soft cheese with a spoon, afterwards 
rub to a paste with mayonnaise or 
butter and flavoring. The delicious 
little cream or Neufchatel cheeses 
may be blended with chopped wal- 
nuts, and given a bit of seasoning by 
Parmesan cheese, also a hint of lemon 
juice and paprika. 

Under the head of savory sand- 
wiches is a long list of possibilities. 
They include meat, fish, and egg, 
as well as fillings obtained from 
chopped olives and pickles, or some 
strong seasoning, such as curry, cav- 
iare, or anchovy. 

For all sorts of meat, use a chop- 
per, grinding with the finest knife. 
It provides a paste which, blended 
with mayonnaise, is as easy to spread 
on bread as butter. Scores of recipes 
might be oifcred to direct this blend- 
ing process, but the clever cook, with 
her own palate as criterion, can eas- 
ily adapt a few suggestions to the 
materials on hand. Chicken com- 
bines well with chopped celery, 
chopped nuts, and olives. The most 
delicate chicken sandwich is seasoned 
with celery salt and moistened with 
thick seasoned whipped cream in- 



stead of mayonnaise. Ham paste is 
blended with mayonnaise, mustard, 
chopped olives, and gherkins. Veal 
paste may be seasoned like chicken 

— indeed one can scarcely tell the 
difiFerence between the two fillings. 
Roast beef, corn beef, lamb, and 
poultry paste make good sandwiches. 
If you have not enough of one meat, 
add to it another which harmonizes in 
flavor; for instance, veal goes well 
with any sort of poultry, while tongue 
and ham make a good mixture. If 
remains of roast beef, lamb, or corn 
beef are small, chop and blend each 
separately; nothing seems to assimi- 
late well with red-blooded meats. 
Use mustard, a few drops of onion 
juice, and chopped pickles as flavor- 
ing. They are better moistened with 
creamed butter than with mayonnaise. 
Put lobster, shrimp, or crab meat 
through the chopper. Cold fish or 
canned salmon is better delicately 
picked to flakes with a fork. Sar- 
dines, anchovies, and salt fish make 
tasty picnic sandwiches. Pound to a 
paste, and give a touch of acidity by 
lemon juice or chopped pickle. Eggs 
should be hard-boiled. Allow them 
to become thoroughly cold, then put 
them through a chopper, mixed with 
mayonnaise or butter, and season 
well. 

In making peanut butter, I mix the 
ground peanuts with cream or milk 
instead of olive oil, if I only desire a 
small quantity. It is delicious, al- 
though it does' not keep longer than a 
few days. 

When one comes to sweet sand- 
wiches, the variety is almost unlim- 
ited. Figs, dates, prunes, raisins, 
nuts, preserved ginger, and candied 
peel may be chopped, sweetened, 
moistened with whipj^ed cream, lem- 
on, orange, or pineapple juice and 
spread between folds of white bread. 

When preparing sandwiches for an 
entertainment cut heart, diamond, or 
club shaped, and on top of each lay 
something which suggests the filling 

— an English walnut meat, a shi*ed of 
green citron peel, or half a Maras- 
chino cherry, dipped in icing to make 
them stick. When you wish to roll 
sandwiclies, use fresh moist bread, 



SANDWICHES FOR PICNICS AND RECEPTIONS 325 



spread very lightly with the filling, 
and pin into shape with a toothpick. 
It is easy to keep sandwiches fresh 
some hours before they are required. 
Wring a napkin as dry as possible 
from hot water — a good plan is to 
put it through the wringer — wrap 
the sandwiches in it, then cover in a 
stone jar or something which will 
exclude air. Paraffin paper is often 
used for the same purpose. 

Lamb Sandwiches. 

Mince cold roast Iamb, season with 
salt, pepper, and a dash of tabasco

ing. Spread between slices of white 
bread.

this place a circle cut from a ripe 
peeled tomato and over the other

AND BREADS — HOW TO UTILIZE COLD CERE.VL DISHES 



Cereals include the grain foods 
from cultivated grasses, containing 
every variety from oatmeal to maca- 
roni, which is a paste made of wheat 
flour rich in gluten. Among them 
are most valuable foods — rice, for in- 
stance, which is the staff of life for 
certain nations. In what are called 
breakfast cereals we have a number 
of foods that are unusually rich in 
nitrogenous matter and mineral sub- 
stances, and therefore luake an ex- 
cellent morning meal with no further 
addition than milk or cream, for aU 
cereals are lacking in fat. Unless 
cereals can be subjected to the long, 
slow cooking which is necessary, 
they would better not be eaten, for 
nothing is so indigestible as half-raw 
oatmeal. Twenty years ago, when 
most of our oatmeal was the old- 
fashioned steel-cut oats, it needed in- 
terminable cooking — ten hours was 
none too long. To-day most of the 
cereals put up in packages, so the 
directions say, can be cooked in half 
an hour. That is not possible; few 
of them, except the fine-grained 
wheat foods, are fit to eat till they 
have had at least one hour's cooking 
in a double boiler. If they can have 
longer, they are so much the better. 

Always add the proper amount of 
salt to a cereal — 1 teaspoonf ul to a 
quart of water — and let it dissolve 
before the grains are put in, so it 
will flavor the whole mass. The best 
way to cook any rough-grained ce- 
real is to drop it slowly into water 
which is boiling briskly in the upper 
part of a double boiler. After cook-

ing for a few minutes on the stove, 
set it over the water and allow the 
grains to swell slowly so the food 
will be stiff enough to be chewed. 

Cornmeal demands a long time for 
cooking — at least six hours — and it 
swells so much that it should have 
six times the same measurement of 
water. Granular cereals, farina, for 
instance, should be mixed with a lit- 
tle cold water and stirred smooth l)e- 
fore being added to the necessary 
amount of boiling water; this pre- 
vents them from becoming lumpy. 
Quantity of water depends upon the 
nature of the grain. 

Flaky cereals require twice their 
bulk of water, granular four times 
as much water as cereals, and finely 
ground, such as cornmeal, three times 
their bulk of water. Never stir any 
cereal after it has been put to cook, 
until just before it is turned out, then 
stir with a fork. Too much stirring 
makes oatmeal pasty and sticky. 
Store cereals in glass cans with tight- 
fitting lids instead of in the paste- 
board boxes in which they are sold. 
Glass keeps them fresher and safe 
from the invasion of moths or mice.

I cupful fine hominy, 
i teaspoonful salt, 

3 cupfuls boiling water. 

Put aU together in a double boiler, 
and cook three hours. Add more 
water if mush seems stifi'; all prep- 
arations of corn absorb a great deal 
of water in cooking, and hominy usu- 
ally needs a little more than four 
times its bulk.

move the cover just before serving 
and stir with a fork to let the steam 
escape. If the water in the boiler be

CEREAL LEFT-OVERS 

The appetizing dishes which may 
be evolved from a small left-over of 
any cereal are many. Even a few 
spoonfuls of well-cooked cereal can 
be utilized in gems or griddlecakes, 
or can be fried in butter and eaten 



hot with maple sirup. Set it away 
carefully, covering tightly. An ex- 
cellent plan is to keep three baking- 
powder tins — a quarter, half, and 
pound size for this purpose. The va- 
riety in size will fit the amoimt of 
the left-over. Brush the can inside 
with butter, or rinse with cold water, 
pack in the cereal while hot, and 
cover. When needed, slij) it out of 
the can, cut in half-inch slices, and 
roll in flour to dry. Dip in egg and 
crumbs and fry in smoking hot fat. 
Eat with maple sirup. Cream of 
wheat, mush, hominy, wheatena, 
Quaker oats, flaked rice, farina. Pet- 
ti John, Ralston's food, wheatlet — in- 
deed, any of the large variety of 
cooked breakfast foods can be made 
palatable in this way. 

If the left-over only amounts to a 
cupful, combine it with flour as given 
in oatmeal muffins and you wall have 
a most satisfactory hot breakfast 
bread. Served with bacon these sec- 
ond-day preparations of cereals form 
a very nice relish. 

The uses of cold rice cannot be 
enumerated. There are so many 
methods of transforming it into at- 
tractive dishes that many housewives 
while preparing hot rice for the ta- 
ble, cook a double portion and re- 
serve it for various uses. A cupful 
of rice is a pleasant addition to many 
hot breakfast breads. It may be 
made into delicious puddings, fritters, 
pancakes. Mixed with a cupful of 
cold tomato or even left-over tomato 
soup, well seasoned, sprinkled with 
cheese and buttered bread crumbs 
and baked till brown, it appears as a 
palatable entree. It can be utilized 
for croquettes, drop cakes, for a 
thickening to soup and stews. Or it 
may be curried, worked into left-over 
meat dishes, or even changed into ice 
cream. Macaroni and spaghetti left- 
overs make good rfchauffis. With 
the addition of a few spoonfuls of 
milk and water, cold macaroni cooked 
in white sauce or spaghetti, — which 
made its first appearance in tomato 
sauce, — may be reheated in the dou- 
ble boiler, a spoonful of each put in a 
ramequin dish, covered with grated 
cheese, and baked.

Fried Mush. 

If there is any cornmeal mush left 
from breakfast, do not scrape it in 
cold spoonfuls into a bowl; reheat 
and allow it to become smooth, then 
pour into a square cake tin; calcu- 
late the amount of mush to the size 
•of the tin, so it will make a cake two 
inches in depth. Cover when it cools 
and set in the refrigerator. When it 
is needed for breakfast or supper, 
cut into squares about four inches in 
size and roll them in flour until dry. 
Drop into smoking hot fat and fry 
brown. Drain, and serve hot with 
maple sirup. 

Corn meal mush will brown very 
quickly when fried, if a little sugar 
is put in the water while boiling. It 
may also be improved by frying in 
olive oil instead of butter.

BREAD— CAKES RAISED BY YEAST — RECIPES FOR CAKES 
OF EVERY DESCRIPTION — CAKE FILLINGS AND ICINGS 



If one has mastered the art of 
measuring, mixing, and baking cake, 
there are only four cakes one has 
to know: sponge, butter, fruit, and 
raised cake. 

Every other cake among a hundred 
recipes belongs to one of these 
classes; there is only a slight varia- 
tion in its being richer or plainer, 
differently flavored, or differently 
named. 

One of the most important things 
to learn about cake making is to have 
all the utensils and ingredients on 
hand before beginning to work. The 
cake process will not wait, if you have 
to search for things. A half-beaten 
batter will fall flat before you are 
ready to attend to it again. Make 
up the fire so the oven will carry you 
through the baking process for at 
least an hour. Have the flour sifted, 
pans greased and floured, eggs sepa- 
rated, and everything ready to work 
with. Let us think of the utensils 
which to-day an up-to-date cooking 
school demands for cake making. 

First there is a bowl for beating 
the batter. I prefer the white 
enamel bowl to one made of earthen- 
ware; it is light enough to handle 
easily, is unbreakable, and can be 
kept beautifully clean. This bowl 
must be deep and narrow enough 
at the bottom to allow the spoon to 
turn over the ingredients and do its 
work thoroughly. The ideal cake- 



339 



mixing spoon is a wooden one with a 
slitted bowl. The old-fashioned 
spoon collects butter and sugar in a 
lump, while a slitted spoon constantly 
drives the creamed mass through it, 
and that, of course, makes it lighter. 
The slitted spoon beats without any 
noise, and leaves no black marks on 
the bowl. Then for the other uten- 
sils, one needs a good flour sifter, 
cake pans, two glass measuring 
cups, a small bowl, a Dover egg 
beater with which to beat the yolks 
of eggs, a large pliable Teller knife, 
and a wire cake cooler, with feet 
which raise it high enough for the 
air to circulate around the cake and 
carry off the steam. 

The only way always to have a 
good cake is always to use level meas- 
urements, as taught to-day in all the 
leading cooking schools. Flour, 
sugar, butter, indeed every ingre- 
dient, is leveled off perfectly flat 
with the Teller knife. Grease your 
cake tin with melted fat, using a but- 
ter brush, then sprinkle flour inside 
the tin. Jar the pan lightly on the 
table, tipping it around so the flour 
will adhere to the greased surface. 
Paper is frequently used with a fruit 
cake, because that cake burns more 
readily than any other. 

Before we begin the process of 
cake mixing, let us see what makes a 
cake light. As compared with the 
making of bread, cake raising is a 



340 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



swift process. It is brought about 
partly by blending an acid salt with 
an aUcali. By this means bubbles of 
gas are created that make the mix- 
ture frothy before it is poured into the 
pans; the heat then expands the bub- 
bles and later sets them. Eggs thor- 
oughly well beaten add further to the 
lightness of cake, for air is entangled 
liberally when the albumen is 
whipped and thus air bubbles are 
formed. 

According to what other ingre- 
dients are used in a cake, we add 
baking powder, soda, and cream of 
tartar, or soda alone in the raising 
process. Baking powder is simply a 
scientific mixture of cream of tartar 
and soda with the addition of some 
filler to keep it dry. It must always 
be used with sweet milk. The same 
combination, of course, is made with 
cream of tartar and soda, the formu- 
la generally given in older cookbooks. 
Soda alone is used when there is some 
powerful acid in the liquid, such as 
sour milk or molasses. 

On making cake when fresh milk, 
buttermilk, molasses, and sour milk, 
are lacking, use a cup of apple sauce 
into which has been stirred some bak- 
ing soda, the amount depending on the 
sourness of the apple sauce. Besides 
being an excellent substitute, the 
sauce makes a delicious spice cake, 
and without eggs, too. 

It is never economy to use poor in- 
gredients in cake. Strong butter and 
eggs that are not absolutely fresh 
cannot have their flavor concealed by 
the most liberal addition of vanilla. 
Also, when you possibly can, use pas- 
try flour. You can easily tell the dif- 
ference between it and the flour with 
which we make bread, by gathering 
up a handful. It will stick together 
in a lump within your hand, while 
bread flour falls apart. Bread flour 
may be used in an emergency, but 
after measuring it, take out 2 level 
tablespoonfuls from each cupful as 
otherwise your batter is likely to be 
too thick, and the cake may crack as 
soon as it begins to crust. 

When a recipe calls for sugar and 
flour, instead of moistening the flour 
with water or milk, stir flour and 



sugar together in the dry state. Then 
no lumps will be seen. 

Now for a good sponge cake. 
Separate the eggs, drop the yolks into 
a mixing bowl, and the whites into 
a large bowl separately. If the eggs 
have been kept in a refrigerator or 
cold pantry, they will froth much 
more quiciily. With a wire beater 
beat the yolks steadily till they be- 
gin to grow thick and lemon-colored, 
adding gradually 1 cupful sugar. 
Put in 1 tablespoonful lemon juice 
and the grated rind of i lemon, then 
1 cupful sifted flour. Beat the bat- 
ter thoroughly, till it is bubbly and 
well mixed. If an assistant, mean- 
time, has been whipping the whites of 
eggs for you, so much the better, 
A Dover egg beater does not begin 
to achieve the amount of frothy white 
you can get by whipping with a wire 
beater. Swing the arm upward and 
downward; and turn over the mass 
of froth, which will grow larger every 
second, lifting it lightly, until it is 
thoroughly blended and looks like 
delicate foam. Beat until the eggs 
stay in the bowl when it is turned up- 
side down. Ihen cut into the yolk 
mixture. Scrape every particle of 
cake batter with the knife cleanly 
from the bowl into a cake pan, pref- 
erably a deep one. Let the mixture 
rise a little higher on the sides than 
in the middle, then set to bake in a 
slow oven. 

The first process in baking is to get 
a cake thoroughly heated through, 
during which time it ought to rise 
steadily without crusting. When it 
has been half an hour in the oven, the 
rising process should have finished 
and a delicate crust should have be- 
gun to form on top. The last half 
hour is given to its becoming solid, 
light brown, and crusty. 

Fudge Cake. 

(An original recipe from the Cop- 
per Kettle Lunch Room at Smith 
College.) 

1 cupful sugar, 
i cupful butter, 

2 eggs,

1 tablespoonful butter, 

I cupful chocolate, grated, 

1 teaspoonful vanilla, 

1 cupful chopped walnuts. 

Put the sugar, milk, butter, and 
chocolate into a granite saucepan and 
stir occasionally till the mixture 
reaches the boiling point. Boil with- 
out stirring eight minutes, then take 
from the fire and beat till creamy. 
At this point add the nuts and va- 
nilla, then pour over the cake. This 
recipe makes a delicious fudge. 

Feather Cake. 

4 tablespoonfuls butter, 

1 cupful sugar, 
1* cupfuls flour, 

2^ teaspoonfuls baking powder, 

2 eggs, 

i cupful milk, 

1 teaspoonful vanilla. 

Put butter in mixing bowl, work it 
with a spoon till creamy, add sugar 
gradually, and continue creaming. 
Sift flour and baking powder to- 
gether; separate yolks of eggs from 
whites, beat yolks till light-colored 
and thick, then add milk and egg 
mixture to creamed butter and sugar, 
alternately with flour. Add flavor- 
ing, stir and beat well; lastly add 
whites of eggs beaten stiff. Piit in a 
shallow greased and floured pan, or 
one lined with buttered paper. Bake 
about thirty minutes or till cake 
shrinks from the pan, and does not 
■tick when tried with a straw. The 



feather cake may be varied and made 
into a number of different kinds, for 
instance: 

Spice Cake. — Before adding the 
beaten whites, put in | cupful seeded 
raisins that have been washed, dried, 
cut in halves, and rolled in a little of 
the flour reserved for the purpose. 
Flavor with i teaspoonful ground 
cloves, i teaspoonful cinnamon, and 
a grating nutmeg instead of vanilla. 
Marble Cake. — Color half the feather- 
cake mixture with i tablespoonful 
Chocolate melted. Mix the white and 
dark part when putting it in the pan, 
so they will be well mingled though 
distinct. 

Ribbon Cake. — To one third the 
feather-cake mixture add i teaspoon- 
ful mixed spices and i cupful seeded 
raisins cut in pieces. Bake in a shal- 
low pan, and the remainder in two 
other shallow pans. When done, put 
the fruit cake between the others 
with a layer of jelly or frosting be- 
tween. 

Layer Cake. — Bake feather-cake mix- 
ture in round tins and put a cream, 
chocolate, or other filling between.

sugar, and continue creaming. Beat 
egg till light and add with the water 
and rest of the sugar to the creamed 
butter. Add flour mixed with bak- 
ing powder. Flavor, beat well, and 
bake in a shallow pan about half an 
hour. Note that this cake will not 
keep long.

flour to make the dough roll well, beat 
the sugar, lard and eggs together, add 
the cream with the soda dissolved in 
it, and finally the flour and baking 
powder. Do not make dough too

PUFF PASTE, PIECRUST, AND PASTRIES

CRUST AND RECIPES FOR PIES OF EVERY DESCRIPTION - 
MINCEMEAT 



If you have a marble slab to work 
on when making puff paste, your 
work will be easier. A rolling-pin 
with movable handles makes the 
touch lighter. Scald an earthen bowl, 
fill with ice water; and wash your 
hands first in hot water, then in 
cold. Work 1 pound butter in a bowl 
cold water until it is waxy and all 
the salt is washed out of it. Take 
out the butter, pat and squeeze till 
no water flies. Measure from it 2 
tablespoon fuls, mold the rest into an 
oblong cake, and set it where it will 
grow hard and cold. Sift 1 pound 
flour with A teaspoonful salt into the 
bowl. Cut in the 2 tablespoonfuls 
butter. Mix with ice water, till you 
have a soft dough. Turn out on a 
marble slab, which has been dusted 
with flour. Knead very slightly; 
then cover with a bowl, and set away 
to " ripen " five minutes. 

"When the dough is ripened, you 
may begin work on it. Put the paste 
on the slab and, with the lightest 
possible pats from the rolling-pin, 
shape it about half as wide as it is 
long, keeping the corners square. 
At center of lower half lay the hard- 
ened piece of butter. Over this fold 
upper half of the dough. Tuck lightly 
around the edges, enclosing all the air 
possible, fold right side of paste over 
and left side under the enclosed but- 
ter. Turn half way round. With 
light taps from the rolling-pin break 
up the butter, spreading it and roll- 
ing the paste into a longer strip. Be 
careful to keep the sides and ends of 



the paste even, and to break as few 
air bubbles as possible. When the 
strip is almost as long as the slab, 
fold ends toward center, making three 
layers. Turn half way roimd again, 
patting, rolling, folding, and turning 
until the process has been repeated 
six times. If the paste shows the least 
symptom of being soft, or the butter 
of breaking through, set it away to 
chill before you finish the process. 
Roll always in one direction, from 
you, with a long, sweeping motion. 
After seventh rolling fold ends 
toward center making four layers; 
chill. During the winter a batch of 
puff paste, wrapped and covered, may 
be kept for several weeks in a very 
cold place. Use it as desired, baking 
path, vol au vents, or tarts as re- 
quired. These will keep five or six 
days after making, being reheated be- 
fore they are filled. 

The oven for baking puff paste 
should be hot, with the greatest heat 
underneath, so the pat^ can rise to 
its full height before browning. As 
heat touches the pastry the bubbles 
expand, lifting the thin layers higher 
and higher. When it has reached its 
height, and is baked delicately brown, 
you have what is properly called puff 
paste. 

NOTES ABOUT PUFF PASTE 

When using a cutter, always dip in 
flour between each cutting; it will 
insure neat edges. 

If the work has to be done in a 



380 



PUFF PASTE, PIECRUST, AND PASTRIES 881 



warm room, chill the paste between 
three pans, the upper one filled with 
broken ice, the second one set into 
another large pan, also filled with ice. 
Pufl' paste is always in good condi- 
tion if it slips easily on the slab. 

Should you wish to use it for a pie, 
bake it vol-au-vent fashion over the 
bottom of a pie-plate first, and fill 
after baking, or use ordinary pie 
paste for the bottom when the filling 
is to be baked. 

Build up the sides with puff paste; 
rich pastry never makes a good un- 
dercrust — it soaks. 

When baking small pieces such as 
pate tops or cheese straws, do not 
put them in a pan with the larger 
pieces; they bake in less than half the 
time required by the others. 

If you wish pastry to have a glazed 
appearance, brush over with beaten 
egg before putting it in the oven. 

Utilize trimmings for smaller 
things; never add them to the larger 
pieces of paste. 

Use the sharpest knife for cutting 
pastry; if it is dragged ever so 
slightly in the cutting it will not rise 
well as it breaks the layers. Also, 
in making two layers of pastry ad- 
here, never press it together or you 
will have a heavy spot. 

Always have puff paste ice cold 
when it is put in the oven. Let the 
heat be greatest at the bottom when 
the paste is put in; it must rise be- 
fore it begins to brown. 

PUFF-PASTE DAINTIES. 
Vol au Vent. 

Lay a mold upon a round of puff 
paste, rolled about half an inch thick, 
and cut out a circle as big as you 
think will be required to cover it. 
Set the mold upside down and tuck 
down the paste, handling carefully. 
Do not cover scantily anywhere or it 
will crack. Prick all over with a fork 
and set away in a cold place to chill 
thoroughly. Find a plate or saucer 
which fits the top of the mold and 
cover with puff paste. Cut from the 
trimmings stars, hearts, crescents, or 
any forms you can produce with a 
paste jagger. Brush the paste on the 



saucer lightly with cold water, and 
stick on the ornaments in any style 
desired. Chill the vol au vent and 
lid for half an hour, then bake in an 
oven which is very hot at first, but 
cooled slightly when the pastry has 
risen and is beginning to brown. 
Watch the baking with great care, as 
the paste will burn or become un- 
shapely if not turned occasionally. A 
vol au vent may be filled with any 
cream mixture or with a cooked, 
chilled fruit and rich sirup. 

Pates. 

Roll out the paste half an inch 
thick; shape two roimds with a 
pate cutter. From one round cut a 
smaller piece. Use the ring left to 
lay on the other roimd, brushing with 
water to make it stick. Bake and fill 
with a creamed mixture, using the 
small round as a lid. 

Cream Horns. 

Cream horns are made on fine- 
pointed tubes which are called lady- 
lock irons. Cut the paste into rib- 
bons with a knife or jagger and begin 
to wind at the small end, the edges 
scarcely touching. Bake delicately 
brown. They may be filled with cream 
and chicken or oysters and served 
as an entree, or with whipped cream 
as a dessert. 

Cheese Straws. 

Season some grated cheese with 
paprika and salt, then dust it over a 
piece of puff paste. Fold the paste 
and roll two or three times. Cut out 
in rings with a doughnut cutter or 
in straws with a jagger. The straws 
may be braided or baked singly. 

PIE CRTIST AND RECIPES FOR 
PIES 

Flaky Pie Crust. 
3 cupfuls flour, 
i cupful butter, 
Ice water to moisten, 
i cupful lard, 
i teaspoonful salt. 

Sift the flour into a chopjiing bowl, 
add the butter and lard, and chop 
with a knife until like coarse meal.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Sprinkle the water here and there 
through the flour, and mix with a fork 
into a soft dough. Drop on a 
floured board, dust lightly with flour, 
press down with the rolling-pin, and 
roll back and forth until the paste 
becomes an oblong sheet not more 
than half an inch in thickness. Slip 
a broad-bladed knife under each end 
of this sheet, and fold over toward the 
center, thus forming three layers of 
the paste. Lift, with the knife, from 
the board, dust with fresh flour; 
lay the paste down again, dust with 
flour, roll, and again fold over as be- 
fore. Repeat the operation, and the 
paste is ready to use. When ice wa- 
ter is added to the flour and short- 
ening, the shortening becomes dis- 
tributed through the flour in small 
balls and is not packed together in a 
mass, and when the dough is drawn 
together and lightly pressed with the 
rolling-pin these balls flatten into 
flakes, which, by repeated foldings, 
are piled one upon another, and by 
gently rolling become thinner and 
more delicate. Three rollings and 
foldings are as much as these flakes 
will bear. Rolling and folding a 
great number of times causes them 
to become broken and packed, so that 
the paste will not rise and puff up, 
as it should, in baking. It is well to 
let the paste lie on ice, or in a cold 
place, for an hour before rolling it 
out for pies, as its quality is im- 
proved by so doing; and if the 
weather is warm it may advantage- 
ously be placed on ice ten minutes 
between each rolling out. If a tea- 
spoonful baking powder be sifted 
with the flour, less shortening can be 
used, but the pastry will not be as 
crisp and delicate.— Emma P. Ewing. 

Apple Pie. 

Roll pie crust to the thickness de- 
sired. Place upon a pie pan, shaping 
it carefully, and cut round the edges 
with a sharp knife. Cover the bot- 
tom of the crust with a thin layer of 
sugar, dust with flour, then fill the 
crust with quarters of pared and 
cored apples. Add sweetening — if 
the apples are very tart — roll an up- 
per crust, make an opening in the 



center for steam to pass out and lay 
over them, trim around the edges, 
press the upper and lower crusts to- 
gether, bake until the apples are soft 
and the top and bottom crusts are 
nicely browned. 

Raspberry Pie. 

To 2 cupfuls raspberries add 1 cup- 
ful ripe currants and 1 cupful gran- 
ulated sugar, with which a tablespoon- 
ful flour has been mixed; stir to- 
gether. Line a plate with flaky pie 
crust, put in the fruit, cover with 
sheet of paste, make several incisions 
for the escape of steam, and bake till 
the crusts are nicely browned. Serve 
cool. 

Cherry Pie. 

2 cupfuls sour cherries, 
1 cupful granulated sugar, 

1 tablespoonful flour. 

Pick over and wash the cherries, 
add sugar and flour, mix together. 
Line a pan with paste, fill with the 
cherries, and cover with a sheet of 
paste, rolled twice as thick as or- 
dinary pie crust. Make incisions near 
the center for the escape of steam, 
and bake till brown. If the cherries 
are sweet, use less sugar. 

Pumpkin Pie. 

2 cupfuls stewed pumpkin, 
1 cupful rich milk, 

i cupful molasses, 
i cupful granulated sugar, 
1 tablespoonful melted butter, 
1 tablespoonful ginger, 

1 teaspoonful salt, 

2 eggs. 

Stir well together, line a deep tin 
pie pan with paste rolled moderately 
thick, sift a little flour evenly over 
the bottom, and fill three quarters full 
with the prepared mixture. Bake 
until the pie is brown in the center. 
In preparing the pumpkin, use very 
little water. Cover the kettle in which 
it is cooking, and stew until the pump- 
kin is perfectly soft, then remove the 
cover and continue the stewing, stir- 
ring frequently till the moisture evap- 
orates and the pumpkin becomes a 



PUFF PASTE, PIECRUST, AND PASTRIES 383 



smooth paste. Rub through a fine 
sieve. 

Pumpkin Pie. 

2 cups stewed pumpkin, 

1 cup rich milk, 

i cup granulated sugar, 

1 teaspoonful cinnamon. 

Pinch of salt, 

Yolks of 2 eggs, beaten. 

Stir this together, put in a pan with 
pie dough, and bake. — Edna Adams. 

Pumpkin Pie. 

1 can pumpkin, 

1 large cup sugar, 

i teaspoonful salt, 

1 large teaspoonful ginger, 

5 eggs, 

1 quart milk, 

Beat pumpkin, sugar, salt, and gin- 
ger together, add first the eggs, and 
last the milk. Make 2 large pies. — 
Mrs. J. E. Anderson. 

Pumpkin Pie. 

Steam one small pumpkin until 
tender, then put through colander. 
For each pie allow: 

1 cup pumpkin, 

1 well-beaten egg, 

i teaspoonful salt, 

i cup brown sugar, 

1 cup milk, 

1 teaspoonful cinnamon, 

i teaspoonful ginger. 

If pastry is considered unwhole- 
some, those who are fond of pump- 
kin or squash pies can provide a good 
substitute by baking them as cus- 
tards. I use the same recipe as for 
a filling for a pie, only add a little 
more milk, and then bake it in cus- 
tard cups set in a pan of water. The 
result is a creamy, delicious dessert. 
— Mrs. A. J. Mielke.

MADE FROM GELATIN 



HINTS ON MAKING PUDDINGS 

The variety of puddings into which 
stale bread enters is endless. It be- 
gins with the old-fashioned, economi- 
cal pandowdy and ends with the 
queen of bread puddings, rich in jam 
and lovely in meringue. For pud- 
dings, use only stale bread or crumbs, 
rejecting crusts and oven-dried 
crumbs. Left-overs of fruit, fresh 
berries, peaches, plums, gooseberries, 
apples, prunes, apricots — almost 
anything can enrich a bread pudding. 
A cujiful of canned or stewed fruit 
or a few spoonfuls of jam or mar- 
malade give a morsel of delicious fla- 
voring. The good cook applies com- 
mon sense to the material she has at 
hand. If the recipe calls for red 
raspberries and she has nothing but 
dried apples, she can season them 
with spices, and the dessert will be a 
success. 

When I use oranges or lemons, if 
the rind is fresh and wholesome, I 
pare it thin, so as to get none of the 
bitter white inner skin, and put it 
in a glass jar of granulated sugar. 
When the sugar has absorbed enough 
oil of the fruit skin to make it moist, 
it is ready to use for flavoring cakes, 
puddings, etc. The bits of rind give 
a delicious flavor to pudding sauces. 

When using lemons in a way that 
does not call for the rind, I pare oflf 



the yellow portion carefully, put it 
through the meat chopper with the 
finest plate, and spread it out to dry. 
Then I put into a corked bottle, and 
it frequently saves grating peel when 
one is in a hurry, or makes a pleasant 
flavoring when a fresh lemon is not at 
hand. 

Use lemon peel, after the juice has 
been partly squeezed out, to rub 
stains from silverware; also to re- 
move fruit stains from your fingers. 

When using grated or sliced pine- 
apple for sauce the juice of half a 
lemon with sugar and water added 
gives a delicious flavor. 

Before trying to break a cocoanut 
put it in the oven to warm. When 
heated a slight blow will crack it, and 
the shell will come off easily. 

Nothing else sweetens vessels in 
which milk has been kept so well as a 
solution of baking soda and hot wa- 
ter, in the proportion of a level tea- 
spoonful to a quart of warm water. 
Let the solution stand in the vessels 
long enough to get cold. Pudding 
dishes or pots and pans which have 
been burned are easily cleaned this 
way. 

The base of any bread pudding 
light as a souffld and large enough 
for a family of 4 consists of 1 cupful 
stale-bread crumbs, 3 cupfuls milk, 
and 1 egg. This may be enriched by 
almonds, chocolate, nut meats, raisins.

currants, and peel or fruit of any de- 
scription. 

Stale calie, especially sponge cake 
or lady's fingers, may be converted 
into delicious puddings. 

If the pudding is to be steamed or 
baked, cut the cake into fingers or 
break it into crumbs. If the pudding 
is to be soaked with wine, have a cus- 
tard, fruit juice, or cream poured 
over it, after cutting it in slices. Re- 
ject icing; it generally makes a pud- 
ding sweeter than is desirable. A 
good plain pudding is made by put- 
ting slices of stale cake in a steamer 
and, when moist, serving with a 
spoonful of strawberry or marmalade 
sauce. Or when cold it may be cov- 
ered with hot stewed berries and 
served with cream. Stale sponge 
cake serves as a foundation for char- 
lotte russe and cabinet pudding, or, 
if steamed, may be covered with 
strawberries and whipped cream, 
when it makes an excellent Imitation 
of strawberry shortcake.

FROZEN DESSERTS 

PROCESS OF FREEZING — WATER ICES AND SHERBETS^ 
FRAPPES — FROZEN FRUITS — ICE CREAM — PARFAITS, 
MOUSSES AND FROZEN PUDDINGS — PUNCHES — SAUCES 
FOR ICE CREAM — GLACES 



J 



To the country housewife who has 
access to plenty of ice, milk, cream, 
and fruit, raw or preserved, frozen 
desserts are not a luxury; besides, 
they require no more time to make 
than a pie. In hot weather at least 
they are very much to be preferred 
to pastry desserts, both hygienically 
and from a palatable standpoint. 
Cream is by no means a necessity in 
the making of frozen dishes — fruit 
can be frozfen, delicious sherbets may 
be made from milk or fruit-flavored 
water, and are as inexpensive as they 
are good. In a home where there are 
children, the little ones will gladly 
come to aid during the freezing proc- 
ess when ice cream is in prospect, as 
every mother knows. 

First, there is the necessity of a 
good freezer. Never economize by 
purchasing a cheap one; the best is 
the truest economy in the end. Also 
provide a strong burlap bag and a 
mallet for smashing ice, as well as a 
dipper to measure salt and ice, for 
half the rapidity of the freezing proc- 
ess depends on the proper proportions 
being used. In winter, snow can be 
utilized instead of ice; if the salt does 
not act rapidly upon it, add a cupful 
cold water. 

Before pouring the stuff to be 
frozen into the can, adjust every part 
and give the crank a few twirls to 
make sure that the freezer is in first- 
class order. Then fill the can, adjust 
it again, and put in the crushed ice 



417 



and salt in proper quantities. If 
there is only a small quantity to 
be frozen, the salt and ice need 
come no higher than the mixture in- 
side. Never fill the can to the top, 
since the ice cream increases in bulk 
as it freezes. At first, turn the crank 
steadily but rather slowly. 

Never draw off the brine till the 
freezing process is accomplished, then 
remove the top and dasher, and pack 
solidly with a spoon, put a cork 
dipped in lard into the hole at the 
top so there will not be the slightest 
danger of brine working in, and re- 
pack the freezer with 4 measures ice 
to one salt. Cover with newspapers 
or a piece of carpet and leave it, if 
possible, for two hours to mellow and 
ripen. When serving time comes, re- 
move the can, wipe it off carefully be- 
fore opening to make sure not a drop 
of brine can get inside, take off the 
lid, run a palette knife around the 
edge of the cream, invert the can on 
a platter, and the contents will slip 
out. If it should prove refractory, 
wring a cloth from water, wrap it 
about the can, and there will be no 
further trouble. 

Keep your freezer in perfect or- 
der. After using, wash it thoroughly 
and set the pieces in a moderate 
oven or over the stove to get per- 
fectly dry. Occasionally a drop of 
oil is needed to make it work well. 
There is a small hole in the cap cov- 
ering the gear; look into this end

and turn the crank till you discover

CHAPTER XXXII 
BEVERAGES FOR ALL OCCASIONS 

COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, AFTERNOON TEA, FRUIT PUNCHES, 
LEMONADE, GRAPE JUICE, ETC., ETC. 



When we speak of beverages, the 
term includes such daily drinks as 
tea, coffee, and cocoa, also the de- 
licious fruit punches, which are easy 
to make and, in hot weather, as cool- 
ing to the blood as they are palatable. 
In preparing all hot beverages, fresh- 
ly boiled water is a necessity, for 
after water has boiled five minutes it 
loses a sort of sparkle that makes all 
the difference between a poor cup of 
tea and one that is stimulating and 
fragrant. As to coffee, there are va- 
rious methods of making it, but in 
boiled coffee, which is the common 
everyday kind, we have probably the 
quickest and most economical method. 
To have coffee at its best, the water 
and coffee should be carefully meas- 
ured, carefully watched and timed in 
the cooking, and the coffeepot kept 
scrupulously clean. Don't buy poor, 
cheap tea and coffee. 

Most fruit punches have one base 
— a sirup of equal quantities of water 
and sugar. This is a much better 
way to prepare such drinks than by 
sweetening them with granulated 
sugar, which can only be half dis- 
solved in cold water. After the sirup 
for such a beverage is prepared, its 
flavoring is limited only by the 
variety of fruit on hand. The ever- 
handy lemon gives it necessary tart- 
ness, and to add to its deliciousness 
anything may be added, even a left- 
over of sirup from canned fruit or a 
cup of cold tea. 

Coffee, if possible, should always 
be served with cream. To keep 
cream sweet lieat it to almost boil- 
ing point, put it in a glass bottle or 



earthen vessel, cover, and set aside 
to cool. Cream thus treated will 
keep sweet and fresh several days, in 
moderate weather, and over the sec- 
ond day in warm weather. 

French Coffee. 

1 cupful finely ground coffee, 
6 cupfuls boiling water. 

There are a number of pots on the 
market for making French coffee. 
Any of them are suitable, provided 
they contain a fine strainer, which 
holds the coffee and prevents the 
grounds from getting into the infu- 
sion. To make coffee in this fashion, 
put the coffee into the strainer, which 
is generally set into the mouth of the 
pot; place the pot on the stove and 
slowly pour the water over the 
grounds, allowing it to filter through. 
If you wish to have the coffee 
stronger, pour out the infusion and 
pour it a second time over the 
grounds, but do not allow it to cool. 

Boiled Coffee. 

6 tablespoonfuls ground coffee, 
1 quart freshly boiling water, 
i white of egg. 

Mix the white of egg with 3 table- 
spoonfuls cold water, beating with a 
fork; add the coffee and stir till wet. 
Scald coffeepot, put in prepared cof- 
fee, pour in boiling water, cover the 
spout, and boil five minutes. Pour 
in quickly i cupful cold water; stand 
three minutes to settle. Strain into 
a hot pot or have strainer on ta- 
ble.

BEVERAGES FO^l ALL OCCASIONS 



435 



Tea. 

Water for tea should be used when 
it has just reached the boiling point. 
Teas are of differing strengths, but a 
safe rule is 1 teaspoonful dry tea to 
1 cupful boiling water. Scald the 
pot, put in dry tea, and cover one 
minute. Add boiling water and 
cover closely. Let stand three to six 
minutes and strain off into another 
hot pot. 

When serving afternoon tea, try 
using slices of orange instead of the 
inevitable lemon. The flavor is very 
delicious, especially when combined 
with green tea. 

Cocoa. 

In a tablespoonful of boiling water 
dissolve 1 tablespoonful of cocoa 
powder, then add a cupful of boiling 
water, and boil together for five min- 
utes, stirring continually, add 1 cup- 
ful scalded milk. Beat with an egg 
beater to prevent scum forming. 
When served, sweeten to taste. 

Afternoon Chocolate. 

1 quart milk, 

2 squares unsweetened chocolate, 
li cupfuls boiling water, 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

Put the chocolate in a double boiler. 
When it melts, add the sugar and 
stir thoroughly till both are dissolved. 
Add the boiling water and boil five 
minutes, then pour over it the scalded 
milk. With an egg beater, whip the 
beverage till it foams, keeping it over 
the fire. Serve from a chocolate pot, 
sweetening to taste and putting into 
each cupful a tablespoonful of 
whipped cream. If you desire the 
chocolate delicately thickened, add i 
tablespoonful cornstarch dissolved in 
cold milk during the cooking process. 

Piazza Punch. 

Juice 2 lemons, 
Juice 1 orange, 

1 cupful sugar, 

2 cupfuls grape juice, 
2 cupfuls water. 

Mix together the juice of the 
lemons and orange, add sugar, grape 



juice, and water. Place a small cake 
of ice in the bottom of a punch bowl 
or in a tall glass pitcher and pour in 
the liquid. 

Lime Punch. 

^ cupful lime juice, 
2J cupfuls sugar sirup, 
2 cupfuls pineapple juice, 

1 cupful orange,

and orange, and water. When ready 
to serve, put in glasses half filled with 
crushed ice and add a few Mara- 
schino cherries.

2^ quarts water. 

Put the pineapple and 2 cupfuls 
water to boil for fifteen minutes. 
Strain through cheese cloth, pressing 
out all the juice. Add 1 pint of 
water to the sugar, boil ten minutes, 
then add the tea, juice of the oranges 
and lemons, grape juice, and the bal- 
ance of the water. Put in a punch 
bowl with a large lump of ice. Serve 
perfectly chilled in punch glasses. 

Fruit Sirup. 

Cook a cup of fruit (strawberry, 
currant, raspberry, cherry) in i cup 
water. Strain, and press out juice 
through a heavy cloth. For every 
pint of very acid juice use J pint 
sugar, bring to the boiling point, and 
bottle. Many hke i water and i 
sirup. Thin to suit the taste. — Mrs. 
A. J. Mielke.

former to a quart of the latter. 
Bruise the fruit in a preserving ket- 
tle with a potato masher and pour 
over it 2 quarts cold water. Put the 
kettle over a moderate fire, where it 
will heat gradually. After it begins

FERMENTATION 

Fermentation in the widest sense 
of the term includes all forms of de- 
composition in both vegetable and 
animal substances when exposed to 
air and moisture at temperatures be- 
tween the freezing and boiling point 
of water. But in common language, 
the word fermentation is more often 
confined to those processes by which 
vegetable juices are transformed into 
alcoholic liquors. These processes, 
however, are entirely similar to pu- 
trefaction, or the decomposition of 
organic matter which sets free foul- 
smelling gases; and decay, or the 
change by which, without moisture, 
the trunk of a tree molders into dust. 
Fermentation does not ordinarily take 
place much below 32° F. or much 
above 140° F. It usually causes liq- 
uids to rise in temperature and to 
give o£F gases with considerable inter- 
nal motion, to become turbid, to form 
a scum and to deposit a sediment. 

Among the useful results of fer- 
mentation are the raising of bread 
with yeast; the preparation of al- 
coholic beverages and certain food 
products, as sauerkraut; the curdling 
of milk by means of rennet to form 
cheese; the manufacture of vinegar, 
etc. 

Among the injurious results are 



441 



the souring of milk and vegetables, 
the putrefaction of meat, the becom- 
ing rancid of fats and the decay of 
articles of wood or textile fabrics. 

Fermentation is caused by the vital 
action of microscopic plants, the 
germs of which may be present in the 
fermenting substance, or may be de- 
posited on their surface from the air 
or from contact with water or other 
substances containing them. Or they 
may be introduced intentionally, as 
when yeast is used for brewing, or 
for making vinegar or bread. These 
small plants feed upon fermentable 
substances and bring about various 
chemical changes. Thus the subject 
of fermentation has two phases: i. e., 
(1) how to induce those forms of fer- 
mentation that are useful, and (2) 
how to prevent those that are in- 
jurious. 

The promotion of fermentation falls 
under such various subjects as fer- 
mented beverages, the making of vine- 
gar, cheese, bread, etc. The preven- 
tion of fermentation falls under such 
subjects as the preservation of food, 
the preservation of timber, etc. 

As fermentation occurs from tlie 
presence and development of germs, 
it is evident that its prevention de- 
pends upon the destruction of any 
germs that are present, and keeping 
away others, or the removal of con- 



442

ditions favorable to germ life. Hence, 
in general, fermentation and putre- 
faction may be prevented by drying 
heat; by cooling below the point at 
which fermentation takes place; by 
heating or cooking substances to a 
point sufficient to kill the germs pres- 
ent, and then hermetically sealing 
them to exclude others; and by the 
employment of various antiseptics, as 
alcohol, common salt, saltpeter, sugar, 
sirup, smoke, borax, and many other 
substances. 

Putrefaction. — This change is a 
decomposition of animal or vegetable 
substances with the liberation of ill- 
smelling gases. It can only take 
place at a temperature between the 
freezing point of water (3-2° F. and 
140° F.), in the presence of moisture 
and after ex])osure to the air. Gen- 
erally speaking, the more moisture 
and the greater warmth present, the 
more rapid is the process. The germs 
of the bacteria which cause putrefac- 
tion are heavier than the germs of 
yeast and mold, and hence do not 
float in equal numbers, as dust in dry 
air. They are more often communi- 
cated by contact with water or moist 
surfaces. For this reason in dry cli- 
mates meats and vegetables may be 
preserved simply by drying or curing 
them by exposure to sunlight. But 
it is well known that if these sub- 
stances are left out after the dew 
falls, and allowed to become mois- 
tened, they may be covered with a 
coating of mold. Most of the bac- 
teria that cause putrefaction are 
killed by exposure to a temperature 
of l-k)° F. for a number of hours; to 
a temperature of 212° F., the boiling 
point of w^ater, for ten to fifteen min- 
utes; or to a temperature of 215° F, 
for 4 or 5 minutes. The activity of 
these bacteria ceases at the freezing 
point, but they cannot be killed by 
freezing, and again become active 
when warmed to a temperature of 
40° F. Hence, in general terms, boil- 
ing in water kills bacteria and freez- 
ing suspends their activity, 

FRESH MEAT AND FISH 

To Keep Fresh Meat. — Refrigera- 
tion in a dry, well-ventilated air 



chamber cooled to a temperature of 
40° F. or lower by means of ice, is 
the best means of preserving fresh 
meat in summer or in warm climates. 
For this purpose ice may be stored 
in northern climates in homemade ice 
houses, and utilized by means of 
homemade refrigerators as elsewhere 
recommended. 

If ice houses are not available, 
fresh meat may be kept for several 
days by the use of sour milk, vinegar, 
charcoal, or borax, or by immersing 
it in cold running water, or by means 
of a mixture of salt, sugar, and salt- 
peter. 

Or hang up joints of meat, if not 
required for inmiediate use in any 
dry, shady place where there is good 
ventilation. They will keep fresh 
from 2 to 4 days, and will become 
more tender and digestible by hang- 
ing. But in all cases, hang them with 
the cut end up and knuckle down- 
ward, or the reverse of the usual way. 
Thus the blood remains in the meat 
and keeps it sweet and juicy. In 
summer, if the weather is dry, lamb 
and veal will keep 2 days, and beef 
and mutton 3 to 4 daj's. In cold 
weather, mutton may be kept for 
twice that length of time. 

Or if running water is available 
from a spring or otlierwise, provide 
a covered box or tub in a shady place, 
into and out of which the water can 
flow. Immerse the meat in this. If 
fresh it will sink of its own weight. 
Look at it two or three times a day 
and as soon as it commences to rise 
from the bottom, it must be used. 
The outside will be somewhat whit- 
ened, but the flavor will be uninjured. 
The meat will be sound and tender 
after 3 or 4 days in hot summer 
weather, and may then be boiled or 
roasted. 

Or pieces of fresh meat may be 
placed in large stone jars and cov- 
ered with skimmed milk, sour milk, 
or buttermilk. They must be weight- 
ed with a clean stone to keep the 
meat under the surface of the liquid, 
and the jar placed in a cold cellar or 
in the running water from a spring. 
It is not necessary to remove the 
bone or fat. Thus fresh meat can be 
preserved for a week or 10 days. The 



PRESERVATION OF MEAT AND VEGETABLES 443 



milk can afterwards be fed to pigs. 
Before cooking, the meat should be 
washed thoroughly in clear water and 
afterwards soaked 3 to 5 minutes in 
water containing about one table- 
spoonful of cooking soda to the gal- 
Ion. This neutralizes the acid of the 
milk and makes the meat more 
tender. 

Or fresh meat may be preserved 
by soaking it for 3 to 5 minutes in 
a solution of one tablespoonful of 
borax to a gallon of water, or by rub- 
bing it with powdered borax dry. 
Rinse with clear water when required 
for use. 

Or trim the meat carefully with a 
knife, removing any parts that seem 
likely to taint, and wrap it up with 
a cloth moistened with vinegar, or 
equal parts of vinegar and water. 
The acid vapor drives away flies and 
the moisture, by evaporation, keeps it 
cold. 

Or rub meat thoroughly with fresh 
powdered charcoal, which has power- 
ful antiseptic properties. It can 
be readily rinsed off with clear 
water. 

Or cut the meat in pieces, not ex- 
ceeding 3 or 3 pounds in weight, and 
pack them down between layers of 
dry corn meal or bran. Or cover 
with corn meal or bran as thickly .-as 
possible and hang in some shady place 
where there is a free circulation of 
air. 

To Preserve Meat from Flies. — In 
addition to the germs that cause pu- 
trefaction, fresh meat is liable to be 
visited by flies and other insects for 
the purpose of depositing their eggs, 
and these will, in warm weather, 
quickly hatch and produce maggots. 
A cloth moistened with vinegar pre- 
vents the approach of insects. 

Or the meat may be rubbed with 
ground pepper or ginger. It may 
also be protected by a coating of 
waxed paper. To prepare this paper, 
melt with gentle heat 5 ounces of 
stearic acid. Stir in 3 ounces of car- 
bolic acid and add, in a thin stream, 
5 ounces of melted paraffin, stirring 
constantly. Remove from the fire 
and continue to stir until the mixture 
sets. Again melt with gentle heat, 
and apply with a brush to suitable 



paper. Wrap up the meat in the 
paper and seal. 

To Preserve Fish. — To keep fish 
fresh without ice for any length of 
time is very difficult. But if ice is 
not available, wash inside and out 
with a solution of equal parts of 
vinegar and water. Lay the fish on 
an earthenware platter on a stone 
floor. Place in the inside of each fish 
a cheese-cloth bag containing fresh 
charcoal in small lumps, about the 
size of small peas or large gravel 
stones, and wrap in a cloth moistened 
with vinegar, or equal parts of vine- 
gar and water. In very hot weather 
remove the cloth and bag of charcoal 
two or three times a day and dip the 
fish into cold salt water. Afterwards 
wrap up as before. 

Or if the fish shows signs of decay, 
immerse in a pickle of vinegar and 
water. 

To Sweeten Tainted Meat. — Apply 
a solution of chloride of soda by 
means of a soft clean brush or sponge. 
With this quickly wash over the 
tainted portions and rinse immediately 
with fresh water. Afterwards broil 
or roast the meat so as to expose 
the tainted portions to a high tem- 
perature and char them with the 
heat. 

Or if they are to be boiled, place 
half a dozen lumps of charcoal, the 
size of an egg, in the water. 

Or place a quantity of pulverized 
charcoal in a cheese-cloth bag, and 
place these in the kettle. All odors 
will be absorbed by the charcoal and 
the meat will be sweet and clean. 

To Keep Frozen Meat. — In cold 
climates and in winter, meat may be 
preserved indefinitely by allowing it 
to freeze. But it must not be per- 
mitted to freeze and thaw frequently, 
and must not be thawed out too 
quickly when required for tise. To 
preserve meat by freezing, first ex- 
pose it to the weather until thor- 
oughly frozen through and through. 
Wrap in waxed paper or cover with 
a cloth coated with shellac or other 
varnish and pack in an ordinary flour 
barrel between layers of hay, straw, 
or excelsior, pressing the whole as 
tightly and .solidly as possible. Place 
the barrel in a bin or packing case, 



444 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



and surround it with a layer of 5 or 
(j inches of dry sawdust. 

To thaw frozen meat when re- 
quired for use, jjlace it in a moder- 
ately warm room at a distance from 
the fire, and allow it to thaw gradu- 
aUy. 

Or better still, soak it 2 or 3 hours 
in cold water. 

If thawed too quickly it will be un- 
fit for use. 

SALTING AND PICKLING MEAT 

Curing Meat. — Among the various 
methods of preserving beef, pork, 
mutton, and other meats for consid- 
erable periods of time, are drying, 
canning, pickling, and smoking. Dry- 
ing meat is practiced chiefly in hot 
climates and in localities where the 
air is free from moisture. It is ac- 
complished by cutting the meat into 
convenient pieces and exposing it 
to direct sunlight on suitable drying 
forms so arranged as to admit of a 
free circulation of air. The canning 
of meat is similar in principle to the 
process of canning fruit and vegeta- 
bles. It consists in cooking the meat 
until tender, placing it while at the 
boiling point in sterilized jars, and 
sealing while hot so as to exclude the 
air. In addition, it is customary to 
pour over the meat the gravy or meat 
jelly in which it has been cooked, in 
the same manner that sirup is poured 
over canned fruits. Pickling consists 
in immersing the meat in a solution 
of antiseptics, usually salt, sugar, and 
saltpeter with soda or potash. Smok- 
ing is accomplished by suspending 
the meat in a suitable chamber, ex- 
posed to the fumes of smoldering 
corncobs, hickory or beech chips, saw- 
dust, or other substances. The anti- 
septic effect of smoking is due to 
impregnation with pyroligneous acid, 
an impure acetic acid which, together 
with tarry matter, is contained in the 
smoke. The effect of smoking is 
therefore similar to that of rubbing 
fresh meat with vinegar, except that 
the admixture of tarry matter pre- 
vents the acetic acid from escaping 
by evaporation. 

Pickling Meat. — The points to be 
observed in pickling are cleanliness 



and sterilization. That is, all foreign 
matter, as blood, dirt, and the like, 
should be removed from the meat, 
and the tubs or casks in which it is 
packed should be sterilized. In addi- 
tion, of course, the pickle must be 
suflBciently strong, and the meat fully 
covered with it and heavily weighted. 
If these precautions are observed, 
there is no reason why meat cannot 
be kept sweet the year round. 

Preparation of Meat for Pickling. 
— Tlie beef, pork, or mutton carcass 
to be pickled should be carefully cut 
into strips of equal thickness, so that 
it can be packed tightly in tubs or 
casks in uniform layers. The carcass 
should be cut up as soon as the ani- 
mal heat is out of it, and the pieces 
to be pickled rubbed thoroughly with 
fine salt or powdered saltpeter or a 
mixture of these dried in a slow oven. 
After the salt and saltpeter have 
been well rubbed over the surface of 
the meat, sprinkle the pieces lightly 
with the same, and lay them on slats 
or boards slanted so that the blood 
will drain off, and let them stand 
from 24 to 48 hours. This will re- 
move all the surface blood and leave 
the meat fresh and clean. When the 
necessary tubs or casks and pickling 
liquid are in readiness, rinse off the 
meat by dashing cold water over it- 
from a dipper or pail. Wipe dry 
with a clean cloth. It will then be 
perfectly clean and ready to pack. 

Pickling Liquid for Meat. — A full 
barrel, if properly packed, will con- 
tain about 200 pounds of meat and 
will require from 6 to 8 gallons of 
pickle, llie proportions of salt, salt- 
peter, and sugar recommended are 
about as numerous as the various au- 
thorities. But as these antiseptics do 
their work separately, the proportion 
is not essential, provided the pickle is 
strong enough. To prepare a stand- 
ard pickling liquid, place in a large 
kettle 8 gallons of pure soft cold 
water, to which add 14 to 16 pounds 
of pure salt, 4 to 6 ounces of saltpe- 
ter, about 6 pounds of good brown 
sugar, or about 3 pounds of the sugar 
and an equal bulk of good New Or- 
leans molasses, to which may be 
added 2 to G ounces of pure baking 
soda. Place tlie whole over a slow 



PRESERVATION OF MEAT AND VEGETABLES 445 



fire and bring to a boil with very gen- 
tle heat, removing the scum as it rises 
so as to have the liquid clear before 
it boils. After the pickle has been 
clarified, remove from the fire. Cover 
to keep out the dust and let stand 
until it becomes cold. 

To Pack Meat. — Scald thoroughly 
the inside of the tubs or barrels by 
pouring into them boiling water and 
washing down the sides with a swab 
of clean cloth tied to the end of a 
stick or clean mop handle. Cover the 
bottom of the cask with common salt 
i inch or more in depth. Pack the 
meat in layers as tightly as possible 
with common salt sprinkled between 
them and, when packed, pour over 
it the cold pickling liquid through 
cheese cloth until the barrel is full. 
Place on top a loose cover of wood, 
previously scalded, small enough to 
slip inside of the barrel and rest on 
the meat. Lay on this a stone or 
other heavy weight, to keep it below 
the surface of the pickle, and be sure 
that the pickle does not evaporate so 
as to leave the meat exposed to the 
air. Otherwise it will rust. The 
above is a general method to which 
the following favorite recipes may be 
added to show the manner in which 
the proportions may be changed ac- 
cording to the experience of different 
individuals. But all of these are 
tested recipes. 

Pickle for Beef. — Dissolve in 8 gal- 
lons of soft water "20 pounds of 
coarse fine salt, 8 ounces of saltpeter, 
and 4 pounds of coarse bro^vn sugar. 
Bring to a boil with very gentle heat, 
skimming constantly. This quantity 
is sufficient for one full barrel, or 900 
pounds of beef, if properly packed. 

Or prepare in a similar manner a 
pickle containing 14 pounds of coarse 
fine salt, 2 ounces of saltpeter, 2 
ounces of Cayenne pepper, 3 pints of 
New Orleans molasses, 2 pounds of 
brown sugar, and 12 gallons of soft 
water. 

Or 10 pounds of salt, 1 ounce of 
saltpeter, 2 pounds of brown sugar, 
and 6 gallons of soft water. 

Or 12 pounds of salt, 4 pounds of 
brown sugar, 4 ounces of saltpeter, 8 
gallons of soft water, and 4 ounces 
of potash. 



Or 2 quarts of coarse fine salt, 3i 
quarts of molasses, 2 teaspoonfuls of 
saltpeter, and 8 gallons of soft wa- 
ter. 

Salting Meat. — Another method of 
curing meat is to rub or pack it with 
a mixture of salt, sugar, and salt- 
peter, but without water, thus allow- 
ing the meat to form a brine by 
means of its own juices. If the brine 
which forms is allowed to drain from 
the meat, it is said to be dry-salted. 
Or if the meat is packed in a tight 
receptacle, and the brine is allowed 
to remain over it, it is said to be wet- 
salted. 

To salt beef or pork, first remove 
all bones. Rub the pieces, especially 
the cut surfaces, with a mixture of 
1 pound of salt, 1 ounce of saltpeter, 
and 1 ounce of sugar. Use pressure 
enough to rub the salt thoroughly 
into the grain of the meat. Let stand 
24 to 48 hours. Again rub with the 
same mixture, sprinkling common salt 
freely between the layers. Cover also 
the top thickly with salt, and put 
over all a heavy weight — the heavier 
the better. 

Or for i a barrel, or 100 pounds of 
beef, prepare a mixture of 4 quarts 
of coarse fine salt, 4 pounds of brown 
sugar, and 4 ounces of saltpeter. 
Rub thoroughly into the meat. Let 
stand 48 hours to drain, turning oc- 
casionally, and pack in layers under 
a heavy weight, sprinkling the above 
mixture between but without the ad- 
dition of water. If a scum rises it 
should be taken off with a skimmer 
and a little fine salt sprinkled over 
the surface. 

Or for the same quantity of beef, 
prepare a mixture of 6 quarts of 
coarse fine salt, 4 pounds of light 
" A " or coffee sugar, 6 ounces of 
soda, and 4 ounces of saltpeter. Cure 
in all respects as above. 

Rusty or Tainted Meat. — If meat 
has been properly drained to free it 
from blood, the pickle boiled and 
clarified, the barrels scalded, and the 
meat kept under the pickle by means 
of a suitable weight, it should keep 
indefinitely. But it is quite custo- 
mary, as a precaution, to pour off the 
pickling liquid on the approach of 
summer, say in April, in temperate 



446 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



climates. Again bring it to a boil, 
with the addition of about 1 pound 
of salt to each gallon of pickling 
liquid, and when cold, once more pour 
it over the meat through a cheese- 
cloth strainer. But this is said to 
harden the beef and injure its flavor. 
It is believed that if the meat is prop- 
erly cured, this will not usually be 
found necessary. 

If the meat should become tainted, 
pour off the tainted pickle and dis- 
card it. Rinse the meat with clear 
water and wash out the barrel with 
a strong solution of lime water or 
wood ashes. If the barrel is much 
tainted, it may be well to fill it with 
this solution and let stand overnight. 
Afterwards scald with boiling water. 

Rub the meat in a mixture of salt- 
peter and sugar, and pack it between 
layers of charcoal. Finally, pour over 
it fresh pickling liquid, prepared as 
above, strong enough to float an egg. 

Or mix 12 pounds of powdered 
charcoal, 10 pounds of common salt, 
and 4 pounds of saltpeter. Cover the 
bottom of the cask with a layer of 
this mixture, rub each piece with the 
same, and sprinkle it freely between 
the layers of meat. By either of 
these methods all traces of taint can 
be removed. The charcoal can be 
rinsed off with clear water. 

Red Pickling Liquid for Meat. — 
To impart a fine red color to meat 
and to improve its flavor, dissolve in 
8 gallons of pure soft water 8 pounds 
of bay salt, 8 pounds of common salt, 
6 pounds of brown sugar, 1 pound 
of saltpeter, 8 ounces of bruised pi- 
mento, 5 ounces of bruised black pep- 
per, and 2 ounces of grated nutmeg. 

To Improve Corned Beef. — The 
quality of corned beef can be im- 
proved by immersing the pieces for 
half a minute by the watch, in boil- 
ing water before pickling. This is in 
accordance with the well-known prac- 
tice of immersing beef that is to be 
boiled for the table in hot water in 
order to harden the surface, and 
cause the meat to retain its natural 
juices. Similarly this method tends 
to make corned beef more tender and 
juicy than otherwise. To effect this 
result first drain the meat to free it 
from blood, rinse it in clear water. 



Bring to a boil a solution of 2 ounces 
of saltpeter in 1 gallons of water and 
with a large fork having a long 
wooden handle, or a piece of wire 
having a hook at the end, immerse 
the pieces of meat for half a minute 
each in the boiling solution. 

Or the same result may be ob- 
tained by pouring the jiickling liquid 
while scalding hot over the meat; but 
the former method is to be preferred. 

CURING HAMS, TONGUES, AND 
BACON 

Pickling Mutton Hams. — First rub 
the hams with a mixture of 1 pound 
of salt, 1 ounce of saltpeter, and 1 
ounce of sugar. Hang up for 24 or 
48 hours to drain. Cover with a so- 
lution of about i pound of salt to 2 
gallons of water, and let stand for 2 
or 3 weeks. Pack closely in tubs or 
barrels and for each i barrel, or 100 
pounds, prepare a pickle by dissolv- 
ing 6 pounds of coarse fine salt, 2 
ounces of saltpeter, 2 ounces of soda, 
1 pint of molasses, and 1 pound of 
brown sugar in 6 gallons of pure soft 
water. 

Pickling Tongues. — After trim- 
ming off the roots, with the exception 
of a little of the fat, rub the cut sur- 
face with a mixture of 1 pound of 
salt and 1 ounce of saltpeter. Sprin- 
kle with the same and let drain for 
48 hours. Now prepare a pickle by 
dissolving in 1 gallon of soft water 
2i pounds of bay salt, 2 ounces of 
saltpeter, and 1 pound of brown 
sugar. Bring to a boil over a slow 
fire, skimming constantly, and im- 
merse the tongues in this. 

Or mix 1 tablespoonful of salt, 1 
tablespoonful of brown sugar and 2 
tablespoonfuls of saltpeter to each 
tongue. Rub this well into the 
tongues twice a day for a week and 
let them stand in the brine. At the 
end of this time, add 1 additional ta- 
blespoonful of salt for each tongue 
and rub the pickle into them once a 
day for a week or 10 days. 

Curing Pork Hams.— Pork hams 
may be cured either by dry- or wet- 
saiting or pickling. It is then cus- 
tomary to smoke them, both to impart 
a smoky flavor and as a protection 



PRESERVATION OF MEAT AND VEGETABLES 447 



against insects. And they may be 
furtlier protected by wrapping or 
sealing in cloth or paper cases. 

To dry-salt hams for smoking, but 
without pickle, which is the English 
method, rub the fleshy parts thor- 
oughly each day with fine table salt 
and hang up the hams for 3 or -l days 
where they can drain. On the fourth 
day, rub well into the haras, using 
plenty of " elbow grease," a mixture 
of 1 pound of common salt, 1 pound 
of bay salt, 4 ounces of saltpeter, and 
i pound of brown sugar. Lay the 
hams on a board or shelf, rind side 
down, and each day apply to the 
fleshy side with a soft brush, a mix- 
ture of 1 pound of brown sugar and 
1 pound of molasses. At the end of 
a fortnight, smoke with hickory wood 
or corncobs. 

Or for each 100 pounds of pork, 
mix 1^ ounces of saltpeter, 1 ounce of 
black pepper, 5 ounces of brown 
sugar and 1 quart of common or bay 
salt. Add just enough hot water to 
dissolve. Mix all together and rub 
thoroughly into the meat. A wom- 
an's hands are not heavy enough to 
do this work properly. It is advisable 
to take out the bone and rub the in- 
side of the ham where the bone is re- 
moved in the same manner. But if 
this is not done, the bone may be 
loosened slightly with a knife and the 
mixture forced into the cut for a few 
inches. Lay the hams with the fleshy 
side up and rub them over with this 
mixture every day for 10 days or 3 
weeks, after which smoke them with 
hickory chips or corncobs. 

Or for a wet-salting process, mix 
1 pound of common salt, 1 pound of 
bay salt, 3 ounces of saltpeter, and J 
pound of brown sugar. Dissolve the 
saltpeter in a little boiling water, 
using no more than is necessary to 
dissolve it. Mix the other ingredients 
and rub the whole thoroughlj' into 
the fleshy side of the ham. Place 
them in a firkin or other tight recep- 
tacle and add for each ham 2 table- 
spoonfuls of pure vinegar. Each day 
turn the hams, and rub the brine into 
them thoroughly for a week or 10 
days. Then let stand 3 or 4 days in 
the pickle, basting them occasionally 
with a large wooden spoon. 



Or for each ham of 16 or 18 pounds' 
weight, mix 2 tablespoonfuls of salt- 
peter, and 4 ounces of brown sugar 
and rub it thoroughly into the fleshy 
side. After which cover the fleshy 
side with a layer of fine salt ^ inch 
thick, and lay the hams down in the 
tubs for 4 or 5 weeks. 

Or mix 1 pound of bay salt, i 
pound of saltpeter, i pound of com- 
mon salt, and I pound of brown 
sugar. Heat to dryness, and rub 
well into the fleshy side of the ham. 
Lay it in a tub, barrel, or firkin, 
the rind side down. Cover the fleshy 
parts with a layer of this mixture 
and each day turn the hams, and 
rub the brine into them for a week 
or 10 days. Afterwards let stand for 
a month basting the pickle over them 
daily with a large wooden spoon. 
Hang up to dry for 2 or 3 days and 
smoke. 

Or protect against insects and 
store without smoking. A small ham 
will require about 2 weeks, and a 
large one 3 to 4 weeks to cure by the 
above method. A tongue will require 
about 12 days. They may then be 
used at once without drying, or may 
be dried and smoked. 

Or if the weather is hot, and the 
hams show signs of rusting, make 
a pickle of common salt and water 
strong enough to float an egg, and 
pour it over them. 

Smoking Pork Hams. — Remove the 
hams from the pickling liquid and 
hang them up to drain and dry. 
AVHien they have drained sufficiently, 
wipe them carefully with a sponge or 
clean cloth, and rub thoroughly into 
the fleshy side a mixture of equal 
parts of Cayenne and black pepper, 
especially about the bone and hock. 
This will prevent flies lighting upon 
them. Now sew up each ham in a 
bag of cheese cloth or scrim to pro- 
tect it from soot, and hang up in the 
smoke house under a barrel or any 
suitable receptacle and smoke — the 
longer the better. Chijis or sawdust 
from hickory or beech wood or corn- 
cobs are the most suitable fuel with 
which to smoke hams. After being 
lighted they must he kept smoldering 
by sprinkling them lightly with water 
whenever they commence to blaze.

And the process may be continued 
for 8 or 10 hours or for several weeks, 
according to convenience or the qual- 
ity desired. Some persons who burn 
wood exclusively as fuel, smoke hams 
by sewing them up in a coarse cloth 
and hanging them up in the chimney, 
but this method is not suitable if 
coal is used as fuel in any part of 
the house. When hams are smoked 
properly the pyroligneous acid of the 
smoke permeates the meat. It also 
dries slowly at the same time. Quick 
smoking merely coats the outside of 
the ham, but does not penetrate its 
fiber. 

Or an imitation of smoking may 
be had by immersing the ham in di- 
luted pyroligneous acid for 2 or 3 
hours, or giving it 3 or 3 coatings 
with a brush. But this method tends 
to harden and toughen the meat and 
is therefore not to be recommended 
for domestic use. 

To Store Smoked Ham. — After re- 
moving hams from the smoke house, 
they may be rinsed in cold water, or 
better still, immersed for 2 or 3 min- 
utes in boiling water, the effect of 
which is to cover them with a coating 
of grease and also to kill any germs 
or eggs of insects that may be pres- 
ent. Next, coat them with flour paste 
prepared by rubbing up 2 teaspoon- 
fuls of flour in a little cold water, 
bringing to a boil, and stirring in 1 
teaspoonful or more of Cayenne pep- 
per. Cover the hams thickly with 
this paste by means of a soft brush, 
and hang them up in the direct sun- 
light until the paste dries. When 
dry, sew them up in coarse cloth, and 
give the cloth a coating of shellac or 
other varnish. 

Or suspend them in a loose bag 
surrounded by finely chopped straw 
to the thickness of 2 or 3 inches. 

Or place them in ordinary paper 
flour sacks. Tie tightly to exclude 
the air and insects and hang up in a 
cool, dark, well-ventilated place. 

Or wrap each ham in ordinary 
brown butcher's wrapping paper, seal 
with paste containing Cayenne pep- 
per, and tie with twine. Pack in 
packing cases or barrels in finely 
chopped straw. A coating of pyro- 
ligneous acid, if carefully applied, so 



as to cover the entire surface and 
penetrate all crevices, will effectually 
prevent contamination of insects. 

Curing- Bacon. — The process of 
curing bacon is similar to dry-smok- 
ing pork hams. Rub the flitches of 
bacon with 1 ounce of common salt, 
1 ounce of saltpeter, and 1 ounce of 
brown sugar. Lay them on slats or 
slanting boards to drain for 48 hours, 
turning frequently. Next lay the 
flitches in a deep dripping pan, and 
cover with the same mixture. Turn 
and rub the pickle into them 2 or 3 
times a daj'' for a week or 10 days. 
Let stand in the pickle for about 3 
weeks in all, basting them frequently 
with a large wooden spoon. Remove 
and smoke as for hams. Place in 
paper flour sacks and tie tightly to 
exclude the air and preserve from 
insects. 



MAKING AND KEEPING SAUSAGE 

Sausage. — Fresh pork, beef, and 
other meats may be preserved in the 
same manner as sausage meat by 
seasoning them highly with spices 
and packing them in air-tight cases, 
or in earthenware or other tight re- 
ceptacles, and running over them a 
layer of melted lard or tallow to ex- 
clude the air. 

Intestine Cases for Sausage. — 
Remove from the pig's intestines 
the loose fat and outer membranes. 
Turn them inside out and cleanse 
them thoroughly in borax water. 
Bleach by letting them soak for 24 
hours or more in water containing 1 
ounce of chloride of lime to the gal- 
lon. Rinse thoroughly in clear soft 
water and scrape or tear off a part 
of the inner lining until they are as 
thin as may be without tearing or 
puncturing them. Finally, wash them 
thoroughly several times in warm 
water. 

Seasoning for Sausage. — Salt, pep- 
per, and sage, according to taste, 
are ordinarily used for seasoning 
sausage. Summer savory is also fre- 
quently used, and other spices, as all- 
spice, cloves, ginger, etc., are some- 
times recommended. But, as a rule, 
salt, pepper, and sage are sufficient, 
and will be preferred by most per- 



PRESERVATION OF MEAT AND VEGETABLES 449 



sons. The proportion of seasoning 
recommended varies, and it is a good 
plan in mixing sausage meat, to fry 
a little of the meat after seasoning 
and add more of the ground meat or 
seasoning, as desired, until the flavor 
is satisfactory. The following are all 
tested recipes, and by comparison, a 
selection may be made according to 
whether it is desired to have the sau- 
sage highly seasoned or not: 

For 10 pounds of ground sausage 
meat, use 4 ounces of salt, i ounce of 
pepper, and f ounce of sage. 

Or for the same quantity, 5 table- 
spoonfuls of sage, 4 tablespoonfuls of 
salt, and 2 tablespoonfuls of pepper. 

Or for each pound of meat, 1 heap- 
ing teaspoonful of salt, 1 of pepper, 
and 1 of sage, with the addition to 
each 3 pounds of meat, if desired, 1 
teaspoonful each of allspice, ginger, 
and summer savory. 

Or for over 25 pounds of meat, 12 
ounces of salt, 2 ounces of sage, and 
2 ounces of pepper. 

Or for 10 pounds of meat, 4 ounces 
of salt, 1 oimce of sage, and 1 ounce 
of pepper. 

Grinding Sausage Meat. — The 
trimmings of the hog's carcass are 
ordinarily ground into sausage meat, 
the proportion of fat and lean being 
varied according to taste. Some pre- 
fer i fat meat to § lean. Others i 
fat to f lean. 

To Prepare Sausage. — To prepare 
good sausage, it is desirable to have 
a sausage grinder or suitable meat 
cutter, although the sausage meat can 
be chopped in a wooden tray with a 
chopping knife or on a block by 
means of a heavy knife or cleaver. It 
will be found easier in mixing the 
spices thoroughly into the meat to 
dry and pulverize them as finely as 
possible, cut the meat into rather 
small pieces and sprinkle the spices 
over it before it is ground. It will 
thus become thoroughly incorporated 
with the meat in grinding. The sau- 
sage grinder is ordinarily fitted with 
a device for filling the cases. If link 
sausage is to be made, care must be 
taken not to fill the sausage cases too 
full, but to pinch and twist them at 
intervals to make them link properly. 

Or sausages may be packed in 



cases of muslin or other clean white 
goods about 2* or 3 inches thick, 
forced in by means of a clean round 
stick of hard wood, laid down in jars, 
and covered with brine or melted lard. 

Or the cloth cases may be dipped 
in melted lard and hung up to dry, 
care being taken that they have a uni- 
form coating of lard to exclude the 
air. 

Or the sausage meat may be laid 
down in earthenware pans 4 or 5 
inches deep, and a coat of melted 
lard ^ to ^ inch deep poured over 
them to exclude the air. As long as 
the coating of lard is not broken, the 
sausage meat will keep indefinitely. 
Or if the dish is not too large, it will 
usually keep after being opened un- 
til required for family use. Or after 
slices have been removed for use, the 
open end can be covered with a coat- 
ing of melted lard until more is 
needed. 

Or large earthenware jars may be 
used for this purpose, although, in 
most cases, they are not as convenient. 

To Improve Sausage Meat. — The 
addition of about i^o ^Y weight of 
ground beef to pork sausage, is pre- 
ferred by many, as it makes the sau- 
sage less greasy and firmer in tex- 
ture. 

Or for immediate use, powdered 
bread crumbs at the same rate may 
be added for this purpose. But this 
should not be used if the sausage 
meat is to be laid down for a long 
time as it will not keep so well. 

Bologna Sausage. — The so-called 
bologna sausage is a mixture of ap- 
proximately equal parts of pork and 
beef or other meats highly seasoned 
and packed in large cases, 3 to 6 
inches in diameter, obtained from the 
intestines of beeves. The following 
mixtures are recommended: 

Grind up together in a sausage ma- 
chine or meat cutter 4 pounds of beef 
and 2 pounds of pork free from fat 
or gristle, to which add 6 pounds of 
fresh fat pork cut in thin strips and 
chopped on a block by means of a 
heavy knife or cleaver into pieces 
about i of an inch square or less. 
Season this quantity with 8 ounces of 
salt, i ounce of saltpeter, 8 ounces of 
coffee sugar, and * ounce of bruised 



450 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



pimento. To exclude the air, the 
cases must be packed with as much 
pressure as they will stand without 
bursting;, and this may he done by 
tying them at the liottom and press- 
ing in the meat with a round block 
of wood or pestle, nearly but not 
quite large enough to fill the inside 
of the case. If the meat is not 
packed tightly enough, the sausage 
will not keep. 

Rub the outside of the cases with 
salt butter. Tie them tightly at both 
ends and hang up to dry for 3 weeks, 
then smoke as for hams or bacon. 

Mixed Sausage. — Cut in small 
pieces equal parts of fat pork, lean 
pork, lean veal, and beef suet. For 
each 6 jiounds of meat add the rind 
of a lemon grated, a small nutmeg 
grated, i ounce of powdered sage, 2 
teaspoonfuls of butter, 4 teaspoonfuls 
of salt, and 1 tcaspoonful of summer 
savory. Pack in cases or lay down 
in jars and cover with lard. 

Beef Sausage. — In summer, when 
fresh pork is not obtainable, raw beef 
may be ground up with beef suet in 
the proportion of about 1 part of 
suet, 2 parts of lean beef, and the 
whole seasoned with 1 teaspoonful 
each of pepper, salt, sage, and sum- 
mer savory ground through the meat 
cutter or sausage grinder, and made 
into cakes to be fried, or laid down 
in earthenware pans under a coating 
of lard until required for use. 

Pickled Tripe. — Empty the paunch 
by turning it wrong side out, taking 
care not to let any of the contents 
get on the outside. Rinse with cold 
water. Tie or sew up the openings 
tightly with strong cord so that the 
lime water cannot get inside, and im- 
merse it in a tub of cold fresh slaked 
lime about as thick as whitewash. 
Let it stand 15 or 20 minutes, or until 
the dark outside skin is loosened 
and can be readily pulled off. Pass 
through 3 or 4 rinsing waters. Tack 
up on a board and with a dull knife 
scrape off the dark surface until it 
looks clean and has no offensive odor. 
Soak for half an hour in hot water, 
then scrape with a dull knife and re- 
])eat until perfectly white and clean. 
Immerse in strong brine and let 
stand 3 or 4 days, changing the water 



each day. Cut into pieces a foot long 
and 6 inches wide, and immerse in 
buttermilk for 3 or 4 days to whiten. 
Rinse and lay down in a suitable cask. 
Cover with pure white wine or cider 
vinegar, or spiced pickling liquid as 
preferred. 

PRESEEVATION OF COOKED MEAT 

In addition to the preservation of 
fresh meat in various ways, cooked 
or partially cooked meats may be 
preserved for considerable periods of 
time by canning or taking other 
means to exclude the air. Meats to 
be canned are first cut into suit- 
able pieces, boiled until tender and 
packed in glass jars surrounded by 
boiling water. The meat jelly, or 
" aspic," in which they have been 
cooked, is then seasoned to taste and 
poured over them, boiling hot, until 
the jar is filled to the brim, and they 
are then sealed while hot. The addi- 
tion of the as{)ic, which is, of course, 
melted when the cans are sealed, but 
which solidifies on cooling, not only 
assists in preserving the meat, but 
also improves its flavor. 

Or suitable tin cans may be used. 
The cans, surroimded with hot water, 
are packed with the cooked meat, and 
the meat jelly poured over them. 
The cover is then soldered in place, 
a s.nall hole is punctured in it and 
the water surrounding the can is 
boiled until steam escapes from the 
aperture. The opening is then closed 
with solder. The condensation of 
the steam inside the can on cooling 
produces a vacuum by wliich the sides 
of the can are made slightly concave. 
And if at any time this concavity 
disappears, or the sides of the can 
swell so as to become convex, it is a 
sure indication that the contents were 
not properly preserved and have be- 
come }nitrid. 

Or to preserve pork chops or sliced 
ham for sunuiier frying, pickle fresh 
pork about 10 days or 2 weeks and 
fry it until about half done. 

Or remove the hams from the brine 
in April, slice, trim, and fry them 
until half done. Pack the chops or 
hams separately in solid layers in 
stone jars. Let them cool, and when 



PRESERVATION OF MEAT AND VEGETABLES 451 



entirely cold, pour over them their 
own fat with the addition of a little 
melted lard, so as to cover the sur- 
face with a layer i inch or more 
thick. Place over the top of the jar 
a layer of cotton batting. Put on the 
lid tightly and store in a cool place 
until required for use. After taking 
out a portion of the meat for use, re- 
melt the lard and pour back over the 
meat to exclude the air. Lamb or 
veal chops, beefsteak or sausage meat 
may be laid down in the same man- 
ner. 

Preserving Cooked Sausage. — Pack 
sausage in cases, or sausage meat, 
into a small crock or bean pot about 
i full. Place in a baking oven and 
bake about fifteen minutes for each 
pound of sausage, i. e., for 6 pounds 
of sausage bake an hour and a half. 
Remove from the oven and set aside 
to cool. When cold, fill the crock 
with melted lard. Throw over the 
top a layer of cotton batting, put on 
the lid, and store in a dark, cool place 
until required for use. 

Or fried sausage can be laid down 
in the same manner and covered with 
its own grease. 

Or for cooked bologna sausage, 
grind together 2 pounds each of pork, 
bacon, beef, and veal free from fat or 
gristle, and 2 pounds of beef suet. 
First cut in small pieces and sprinkle 
over it before grinding 4 ounces of 
salt, 6 tablespoonfuls of black pep- 
per, 1 tablespoonful of cayenne, and 
pack tightly into beef cases 4 or 5 
inches in diameter. Form links about 
12 or 15 inches in length, tying at 
both ends. Prick the skins and boil 
for about an hour. Hang up to dry 
for 2 or 3 days and afterwards smoke 
with hickory wood or corncobs. 

Or grind up together with suitable 
seasoning equal quantities of ham, 
veal, or pork; or I pork and § beef. 
Cook and smoke as above. 

Potted Beef. — Cut 3 pounds of lean 
beef into pieces weighing about 3 of 
a pound each and sprinkle over tliem 
a mixture of i pound of table salt 
and i ounce of powdered saltpeter. 
Let the beef lie in this pickle 2 or 3 
days, turning the pieces occasionally. 
Remove the meat from the pickle, 
place it in a stone jar or pan cov- 



ered, if convenient, with a little beef 
gravy or just enough cold water to 
prevent burning. Put an earthen- 
ware plate over it and bake in a 
slow oven for about 4 hours, or un- 
til the meat is very tender and falls 
away from the bones. Remove the 
meat from the gravy. Shred or chop 
it fine, moisten it with the gravy 
and pound it in a marble mortar or 
otherwise with a little fresh butter to 
a very fine paste. Season to taste 
with pepper, allspice, nutmeg, mace, 
or cloves. Or add, if desired, cay- 
enne, tabasco, curry powder, or an- 
chovies, mustard, or other condiment, 
according to taste. Press tightly in 
small crocks or jars, or in fruit jars. 
When cold, pour over the tops of the 
jars melted lard or butter to a thick- 
ness of i inch, and cover with a layer 
of cotton batting tied tightly on any 
cover that will exclude the air. 

Pressed Beef. — Or select about 5 
pounds of cheap beef that would 
otherwise be too tough to cook, in- 
cluding about I of a pound of beef 
fat. Cover with a mixture of f pound 
of salt and i ounce of saltpeter and 
let stand for a couple of days turn- 
ing it now and then, and rubbing 
brine into it. Rinse in clear water 
and boil until it falls from the bones, 
taking care that when boiled down, 
the gravy will be as thick as possible. 
Remove the beef from the gravy with 
a skimmer and chop fine. Allow the 
gravy to cool. Take off the cake of 
fat, and dissolve i ounce of gelatin 
in the gravy with gentle heat. Spice 
to taste. Stir in the chopped meat. 
Pack in jars under a weight and pour 
melted lard or butter over the top to 
the depth of i inch or more. If care- 
fully preserved from the air, this will 
keep for a considerable time at ordi- 
nary temperatures, and may be sliced 
and eaten cold without further cook- 
ing. 

lARD, BUTTER. ETC. 

Lard. — The leaf fat which adheres 
to the ribs and belly of the hog make 
the so-called " leaf lard," which is of 
the best quality. Hence it is a good 
plan to try out the leaves separately. 
But any part of the hog fat not used 



452 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



for other purposes may be tried out 
to make an ordinary quality of lard. 
A set kettle, or other large kettle, 
held ever a camp fire by means of a 
tripod out of doors on a clear, calm 
day, is the best utensil for this pur- 
pose. Cut the fat into small pieces 
1 or 2 inches square, and add 1 ounce 
of soda for each -25 pounds of meat. 
Stir frequently as soon as the fat 
melts and the scraps begin to brown. 
Melt with very gentle heat, taking 
care not to allow the fat to smoke or 
burn. Toward the last, the lard must 
be stirred constantly to prevent burn- 
ing. The lard will be done when the 
steam ceases to rise. When the 
scraps are brown and shriveled, 
throw in a little salt to settle the 
sediment, and strain through a cheese- 
cloth strainer into tubs or jars. Tie 
over the tops a layer of cotton bat- 
ting to exclude the air. Lard will 
keep better in small jars than in large 
ones. Good lard should be white and 
solid without any offensive odor. 
Store in a cool, dry place. The lard 
from the intestines will not keep as 
well as leaf lard, hence should be ren- 
dered separately. It will keep bet- 
ter if soaked for 3 or 4 days in strong 
brine changed each day. 

Bleaching Lard. — The addition of 
about 1 pint of boiled white lye from 
hickory ashes, strained through cheese 
cloth into the fat before boiling, tends 
to bleach it. 

Adulteration of Lard with Water. 
— The addition of 3 to 5 per cent 
milk of lime allows about 25 per cent 
of water to be mixed with lard while 
cooling, thus greatly increasing its 
weight and volume. The presence of 
water may be perceived by the sput- 
tering made in melting the lard. 
Also, the water will collect in the bot- 
tom of the vessel and the lard will 
float on its surface. This test will 
often show that the purchaser is pay- 
ing for a considerable percentage of 
water instead of lard. 

Butter. — To 2 gallons of brine 
strong enough to bear an egg, add 
i pound white sugar, and 1 table- 
spoonful saltpeter. Boil the brine, 
skimming frequently. When cold, 
strain carefully. Make the butter 
into rolls, wrap each separately in 



white muslin and tie with string. 
Pack a large jar full, weigh the but- 
ter down and pour over the brine un- 
til all is submerged. Do not put 
upon ice butter that you wish to keep 
any length of time. — Gertrude B. Day. 

Cod Fat. — The suet taken from the 
beef flank is called cod fat. It makes 
a much softer and better fat than 
the common suet. Obtain tlie best 
looking pieces of cod fat from the 
butcher, free them from veins or 
spots and melt with very gentle heat. 
Pour the melted suet into clear cold 
water, iced water, if convenient, to 
harden. Pour off the water, remove 
all dampness with a clean dry cloth. 
Wrap up the fat in waxed paper and 
store in a cool, dry place. 

Cottolene. — This substitute for 
lard or suet consists of 6 parts cot- 
ton oil, 4 parts oleostearine. Melt to- 
gether with very gentle heat and run 
through a filter' in jars. This is pre- 
ferred by many to animal fat, being 
purer as well as cheaper. 

PRESERVING, TESTING, AND 
PACKING EGGS 

Preservation of Eggs. — More hens' 
eggs are laid during the months of 
March, April, May, and June than 
during the other 8 months of the 
year. Hence the bulk of the con- 
sumption of eggs during the fall and 
winter months is of eggs that are not 
fresh laid. The commercial method 
of preserving eggs is by means of 
cold storage in vaults kept at a tem- 
perature of 40° F. or less. Eggs are 
collected all over the United States 
and stored in the largest cities, 
whence they are distributed at whole- 
sale and often times sold in the win- 
ter months to farmers and others who 
keep hens, but who are not, at that 
season, getting enough eggs for their 
own consumption. The wholesale 
market recognizes seventeen grades 
of eggs according to their size, weight, 
and freshness and the localities from 
which they come. But the ordinary 
buyer of eggs is unable to distinguish 
arnong them, and often gets a very 
much cheaper grade of cold-storage 
egg than slie pays for. Hence on all 
grounds, it is much better and 



PRESERVATION OF MEAT AND VEGETABLES 453 



cheaper for those who keep chickens 
to preserve, in the season when eggs 
are plentiful, all that are not required 
for immediate use. If care is taken, 
eggs if perfectly fresh when pre- 
served will be nearly, if not quite 
equal to new. But at all events, 
home-stored eggs, if properly pre- 
served, will be superior to cold-stor- 
age ones, which are often far from 
fresh when gathered and placed in 
storage. 

Testing Eggs. — Eggshells are por- 
ous or perforated right through by 
minute holes for the admission of 
air needed by the chick for breathing. 
Hence in time a part of the liquid 
contents of the egg evaporates. The 
white and yolk shrink and the result- 
ing emptied space is filled with air. 
This space is normally at the broad 
end. And this is the reason why, in 
storing eggs, the point should always 
be downward. To test eggs take a 
candle or electric light or lamp in an 
otherwise dark room and fit it with a 
candling chimney, which may be ob- 
tained at any poultry store or may 
be readily made from a piece of card- 
board. This is merely a cylinder of 
cardboard large enough to surround 
the candle or the lamp chimney, and 
having a tube inserted at right angles 
somewhat smaller in diameter than 
an ordinary egg, and about the level 
of the flame. Through this the egg 
can be observed against the light. 

To test eggs, hold each one up 
against the opening of this cylinder, 
broad end upward, and look through 
them at the light. If the contents do 
not fill the shell, the egg is not per- 
fectly fresh, and the larger the air 
space the older is the egg. The yolk 
should be perfectly clear and round 
in outline. If, besides the air space, 
there is a dark haze or cloud in the 
egg, it has become spoiled. If the 
cloud contains a black spot, the egg 
is bad. All storage eggs show some 
shrinkage, and eggs shipped by 
freight from distant points to a 
wholesale market, will shrink on the 
way even if not afterwards preserved 
in cold storage. 

Methods of Preserving Eggs. — The 
object to be secured in preserving 
eggs is to prevent the evaporation of 



their contents, and thus prevent the 
air coming in to fill the space. This 
may be accomplished by any method 
of filling the pores of the shell so as 
effectually to prevent the passage of 
air. Among the substances recom- 
mended for this purpose are mucilage 
made of gum arabic or gum traga- 
canth dissolved in water; albumen, or 
the white of egg; collodion, linseed 
oil, paraffin; shellac, or other varnish; 
saltpeter, lard, sugar sirup; finely 
powdered gypsum, or plaster of 
Paris, dry salt, and various solutions, 
as lime, soda, saltpeter, salt, etc., in 
water. 

As a result of an exhaustive series 
of experiments with all the above and 
many other methods, under the aus- 
pices of the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, the following 
process has been recommended, and 
has been successfully tested at the 
various experiment stations and by 
many poultry keepers, farmers, and 
others. It is believed that if this 
recipe is carefully followed no other 
will be required. 

Mix one part of the soluble silicate 
of sodium, — a substance commonly 
called liquid glass, or water glass, 
which costs about twenty-five cents a 
quart, and is available at every drug 
store — with 9 quarts of pure water, 
freshly boiled and cooled. Pack the 
eggs, small end down, in a clean stone 
or earthenware jar, taking care not 
to allow any metal to come in con- 
tact with them, and pour the solution 
over them. Cover with a loose board 
and store in the cellar or other cool 
place. An additional supply of the 
sodium silicate solution may be kept 
at hand in a large glass jar or other 
receptacle and additional eggs and 
solution added from time to time, as 
required, provided the solution is al- 
ways kept at a level of at least 2 
inches above the tops of the eggs. A 
little pure water, freshly boiled and 
cooled, may be added from time to 
time as the water evaporates. The 
eggs should be strictly fresh and it 
should be noted that unfertile eggs 
keep better than fertile ones. They 
should not be washed, as washing in- 
jures their keeping qualities, prob- 



454

ably by dissolving the mucilaginous 
coating on the outside of the shell. 

Packing Eggs. — To pack eggs for 
transportation, layers of newspaper 
or any soft, cheap paper that may be 
available will be found safer than 
oats or bran. Crumple a number of 
newspapers, and lay them in tlie bot- 
tom of the box or basket, and bring 
them up well around the sides. Pack 
the eggs close together so that they 
cannot roll against each other. Lay 
over them 3 or 3 thicknesses of paper, 
on this another layer of eggs, and so 
on. Throw over the top 2 or 3 thick- 
nesses of coarse burlap and fasten it 
around the outside of the package 
with cord. Eggs packed in this way 
in a clothes basinet may be driven in 
a wagon over the roughest roads with- 
out breaking. 

Or to pack for market, obtain an 
egg case, manufactured for this pur- 
pose, which will serve as a model for 
making cases at home. Or they can 
be made at trifling expense by the 
local carpenter. It will be found that 
the cost of these cases will be more 
than repaid in convenience and in 
preventing breakage. 

Pickling Eggs. — Prepare a spiced 
piclvling liquid the same as for spiced 
cucumber or other pickles. 

Or boil in a cheese-cloth bag for 
15 or 20 minutes in 1 quart of white 
wine or pure cider vinegar, 1 ounce 
of raw ginger, 1 ounce of allspice, 2 
blades of mace, 1 ounce of pepper, 1 
ounce of salt, 3 or 4 cloves of garlic, 
and 1 ounce of mustard seed. Boil 
for this quantity of pickle, a dozen 
eggs for 10 minutes. Place to cool 
in a pan of cold water. Remove the 
shells, pack them in a crock, and when 
perfectly cold, pour the pickling 
liquid over them. Lay over the top 
a folded cloth to keep the eggs under 
the pickling liquid, and tie over the 
top of the jar a thickness of cotton 
batting. They will be ready to use in 
about 4 weeks. 

Dried Eggs. — Break any quantity 
of eggs in a suitable receptacle, and 
beat them well with an egg beater. 
Spread out in a thin layer on a clean 
earthenware platter, and let them dry 
into a paste. Pack closely in glass 
jars and seal. 



Or pour the beaten eggs into glass 
jars and set the jar in a pan of hot 
water at about a temperature of 125° 
F. until the moisture is evaporated 
and the egg becomes hard. Seal un- 
til required for use. They can then 
be dissolved with about 3 times their 
own bulk of cold water, and beaten 
up together, when they will be found 
to have retained much of their origi- 
nal flavor. 

STORING AND PRESERVING VEGE- 
TABLES, FRUIT, NUTS, AND HERBS 

Conditions that cause vegetables to 
decay are moisture and heat, or fre- 
quent and extreme changes of tem- 
perature, as alternate freezing and 
thawing. These conditions are also 
favorable to the attacks of insects. 
Cold storage in a dry vault, with a 
temperature near or below the freez- 
ing point, is, of course, the best 
method. Cooperative cold storage 
plants, both large and small, the bene- 
fits of which may be shared by a 
group of neighbors or an entire com- 
munity, are likely in time to come to 
be very numerous. But if cold stor- 
age is out of the question, a cool, dry 
place, where the temperature is likely 
to be as even as possible, should be 
sought for most vegetables. 

Vegetable Pits. — To preserve root 
crops — as beets, turnips, and par- 
snips, also cabbages — dig a trench on 
the north side of a sandy slope or 
ridge where the drainage is as per- 
fect as possible, so that after a storm 
no water will stand in the trench. 
Dig a trench two or three feet deep 
about the same in widtli, and any de- 
sired length. Pack the vegetables 
carefully in this. Pile them up in a 
pyramid like the ridge of the roof of 
a house. Cover with a layer about a 
foot thick of meadow hay or straw 
and throw enough earth lightly over 
the straw to keep it in place. After 
the first frosts in the fall cover with 
a layer of earth 5 or 6 inches thick, 
and in the latter part of November 
or about the 1st of December, cover 
solidly with earth to the depth of a 
foot or more. Remove the vegetables 
from one end as required for use and 
cover tlie opening with hay or straw 



PRESERVATION OF MEAT AND VEGETABLES 455 



and keep it in place with boards, or 
shovel snow over it. 

Ventilate these pits by means of 
6-inch tile drains or square boxes of 
6-inch boards nailed together. Insert 
these ventilators at intervals of 25 or 
50 feet in large pits and plug the 
opening with loose straw to keep out 
the frost. Otherwise there is danger 
of decay from moisture in the event 
of an early thaw. 

Or pull root crops, as turnips, 
beets, and the like on a hot, dry day 
and let them lie in the sun until all 
dirt can be shaken from the roots. 
Twist off the tops, leaving the tap 
root on. Pack them in clean, dry 
barrel or bins and fill with fine dry 
sand or road dust, shaking it down 
around them until the box or barrel 
is full. Root crops should not be 
packed on the floors of cellars, as 
dampness is likely to cause them to 
decay and furnish breeding places 
for bacteria that cause filth dis- 
eases. 

To Keep Celery. — In the latter part 
of October dig a trench 18 inches deep 
and 12 to 15 inches wide on a dry, 
well-drained ridge. Loosen the earth 
about the roots of the celery and 
draw out the stalks without shaking 
off the soil that adheres to them. 
Stand them upright close together in 
the trench inclining slightly toward 
the middle, and draw the earth 
around them up to the tips. Cover 
with a thick layer of leaves, straw 
or meadow hay, put a board across 
the top and weight with stones or 
otherwise. If there is any danger of 
standing water from rains or melt- 
ing snow, in winter, dig a ditch 
deeper than the celery trench for 
drainage. 

Vegetable Cellar. — To preserve 
small quantities of vegetables for do- 
mestic use, sink a half hogshead, cask, 
or large dry-goods box about two- 
thirds of its depth into the ground 
and slope the earth around it on all 
sides to the top. Knock the bottom 
out, and line the space with loose bricK 
laid on the earth side by side or witn 
a layer of loose stone. Fit it with a 
water-tight cover coming down over 
the edge. 

Pack in this such vegetables as cab- 



bage, celery, beets, turnips, etc. They 
will keep fresh all winter. 

When cold weather comes on, throw 
over the top a large bag of burlap or 
potato sacking made like a mattress 
and filled loosely with hay or straw. 
This can readily be removed to allow 
access and rejilaced after required 
vegetables have been taken out for 
use. 

To Store Onions. — Pull the onions 
and let them lie in the field until the 
tops are withered. Spread them un- 
der cover on an open floor or on slats 
until they are bone dry. 

The best receptacles for onions are 
slat boxes having solid heads of inch 
pine stuff, with sides and bottoms of 
rough laths, the width of one lath 
open between every two. These 
should be made to hold a bushel or 
half a bushel. Stack them one above 
the other, with pieces of inch pine 
stuff between to admit of free circu- 
lation of air. Pack these in a cool 
cellar on a platform raised 8 or 10 
inches from the cellar bottom. 

Or stack them in a shed or out- 
house. Make a bin around them of 
rough boards about 6 inches from the 
outside of the crates, and fill the 
space with chopped straw, chaff, or 
sawdust. Cover over the top with 
sand and throw over the whole any 
old burlap, carpet, or canvas that may 
be at hand. Thus protected it will 
do no harm if the onions freeze, as 
chaff or straw is a nonconducting 
material, and they will not thaw out 
until spring, and then very slowly. 
The same would be true in an ordi- 
nary cellar. 

Or small quantities may be packed 
in barrels or boxes in chaff or saw- 
dust, and stored in a dry attic which 
is not heated in winter. 

To Keep Parsnips. — Parsnips may 
be left in the ground all winter in 
temperate climates, or in very severe 
climates they may be buried in a deep 
pit in the garden. 

Or pull them late in the fall, leave 
the tips on, and lay them side by 
side in rows and cover with 6 or 
8 inches of coarse straw, leaves, or 
chaff. Freezing tends to improve 
their quality. 

Salsify.— Like parsnips, salsify is 



456 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



improved by freezing and hence 
may be preserved in the same man- 
ner. 

Turnips. — Turnips are not injured 
by freezing. Hence they may be 
packed in small crates, boxes, or bar- 
rels placed in an outhouse and cov- 
ered with straw to exclude the light 
and to prevent their thawing readily. 
Or they may be buried in trenches or 
packed in boxes or barrels between 
layers of fine earth and allowed to 
freeze. 

Beets. — Beets may be stored as for 
onions, but should be kept in a dry 
place and at as uniform a tempera- 
ture as possible. In small quantities 
they may be stored in any suitable 
receptacle in sand or dry moss. 

Squashes and Pumpkins. — These 
vegetables are very susceptible to 
frost and moisture. Hence they 
should not be placed in cellars or 
outhouses. Hung by the stem from 
the ceiling in a warm, dry storeroom 
the hard-shelled varieties will keep 
practically all winter. 

To Store Tomatoes. — Pack green 
tomatoes in lath crates and store in 
a cool, dry storeroom away from the 
frost. 

To Store Potatoes. — Potatoes are 
usually stored in bins or barrels in a 
dark cellar. They should not be left 
in the field any longer than is neces- 
sary to dry them after being dug, as 
they are injured by exposure to di- 
rect sunshine. It is advisable to cover 
the bottom of the bin or barrel with 
a layer of fine, dry sand, throw over 
the top a piece of burlap and place 
a layer of sand on this. They should 
be examined once or twice a month 
during the winter, and if they com- 
mence to rot should be picked over, 
care being taken to handle them care- 
fully so as not to bruise them. 

To Store Sweet Potatoes. — Pack in 
boxes or barrels on a very hot day in 
summer in clean, dry sand. Take 
care that the potatoes do not touch 
one another, and place in a dry store- 
room where the temperature will 
range between 40° and 60° F. Care 
must be taken not to bruise them, and 
they must be bone dry when packed. 
Small quantities procured from deal- 
ers in winter may be kept in sand 



near the kitchen stove, or in any 

warm, dry place. 

To Store Cabbage. — Cabbages are 
not injured by frost, but wither and 
wilt in a drying heat. Hence they 
should be kept in a cool, dark, and 
moist place, but must not be kept in 
standing water, as it injures their 
flavor, or packed together, else they 
will heat and rot. 

Cut them before the severe fall 
frosts, leaving about 2 inches or more 
of the stem attached. Let the out- 
side leaves remain on. Tie a strong 
cord about the stalks, and hang them 
from the timbers of the ceiling of a 
cool, dry cellar, heads downward. 
Several cabbages may be suspended 
on one cord one above another, and 
in this way a large number can be 
stored in an ordinary cellar, just 
enough space being left among them 
to admit of a circulation of air. 

Or pack in sawdust in large casks 
or packing cases. Take care to have 
a layer of several inches of sawdust 
between the cabbages and the box. 
Put them in any outhouse and let 
them freeze. Sawdust being a non- 
conductor, they will not thaw out un- 
til spring, and will not be injured. 

Or cabbages may be stored out of 
doors by loosening the earth about 
the roots and pulling them up with- 
out shaking off the dirt which ad- 
heres. Now set them out in furrows, 
burying the roots just as they grow 
up to the head in soil. Let the heads 
touch. Drive posts in the ground, 
build a shed roof over them of rough 
boards or poles high enough so that 
there will be circulation of air be- 
tween the roof and the cabbages, and 
cover the roof with corn fodder or 
straw. Pack straw or meadow hay 
around the sides to keep out the snow, 
and let them freeze. They will keep 
green and fresh all winter. 

Sauerkraut. — Sauerkraut consists 
of sliced cabbage laid down between 
layers of common salt — at the rate of 
about one pint of salt to a barrel of 
cabbage — in a wooden tub or firkin, 
and with the addition of black pep- 
per, anise, mustard, caraway, or cel- 
ery seed if desired. 

Thoroughly scald the tub, firkin, or 
cask. Remove the outer leaves of the 



PRESERVATION OF MEAT AND VEGETABLES 457 



cabbage and use them to line the 
cask. Slice the heart of the cabbage 
fine by means of a slaw cutter or 
sharp knife. Place a layer of clean 
leaves on the bottom of the cask. 
Sprinkle over them a small handful 
of salt and put in a layer of sliced 
cabbage about 6 inches in depth, using 
the outer leaves as a lining to keep 
the sliced cabbage from the sides of 
the cask. Sprinkle over the cab- 
bage a small handful of salt, and by 
means of a wooden bettle or the end 
of a round stick of hard wood, pound 
the cabbage until it is a solid mass, 
or until the juice just makes its ap- 
pearance, but do not pound or salt 
the cabbage too much. Now add an- 
other layer of cabbage and another 
handful of salt, and so continue 
pounding down each layer solidly un- 
til the cask is nearly full. 

Cover the top over with the loose 
outer leaves, and lay over these sev- 
eral thicknesses of cheese cloth. Lay 
on a loose cover of boards and on this 
a weight of stone equal to 25 or 30 
pounds. Let the cask stand in a 
warm place for three or four weeks, 
during which it will ferment and give 
off at first a very disagreeable odor. 
After forty-eight hours, if brine has 
not been formed, add a little salt wa- 
ter, about as salt as tears, to cover 
the cabbage. After two days more, 
add more salt water, if necessary, 
until brine forms over the top of the 
board cover and a scum appears. 
Remove the cloth cover, taking the 
brine with it, rinse thoroughly in 
cold water, wring dry, and return to 
its place. Continue to do this every 
few days until it ceases to ferment. 
This will require four or five weeks. 
It is then ready for use and may be 
stored in any cool, dark place. 

Sauerkraut is usually made in the 
fall for winter use, but if it is desired 
to keep what is left for use in sum- 
mer, squeeze out the brine through 
cheese cloth. Select a suitable earth- 
enware jar, sprinkle the bottom with 
salt and pack the sauerkraut in this. 
Make a brine by dissolving 1 table- 
spoonful of salt to a quart of cold 
water. Bring to a boil over a slow 
fire removing the scum as it rises. Set 
aside to cool and pour over the sauer- 



kraut. Lay over the top several 
thicknesses of cheese cloth, and tie 
over the jar a piece of cotton batting. 
This will keep until the hottest days 
of summer. 

Cauliflower. — In a well-drained 
part of the garden dig a ditch 12 or 
15 inches deep and 13 inches wide. 
Pack the cauliflowers in this with the 
roots down and cover witli earth up 
to the heads. Fill the trench with 
hay or straw 6 or 8 inches thick, and 
weight it down with stone, earth, or 
boards. 

Or pack the cauliflowers on the cel- 
lar bottom, burying the roots and 
stalks in earth. In this way they can 
be kept until the 1st of March or 
later. 

To Store Green Beans. — Pack down 
green string beans in glass jars be« 
tween layers of salt. Seal the jars. 
When required for use, freshen in 
clear water for several hours, chang- 
ing the water frequently. 

To Store Green ' Peas.— Select 
shelled peas that are full grown but 
not hard and dry them in a dripping 
pan in a very slow oven or on the 
back of the stove. Let them dry 
slowlj% stirring them frequently, and 
do not have them too thick in the pan. 
Continue the heat until they are hard 
and dry as bone. Pack in glass or 
stone jars. Seal and keep in a dry 
place. Let soak overnight in cold 
water before boiling. 

To Store Dry Beans. — Dry shelled 
beans should be stored in a dry, cool 
place, and will not require protec- 
tion unless they become infested with 
bugs. In that case place the beans in 
a coarse sack or basket and dip them 
in boiling water for a minute or two. 
Hang up to drip dry and they wiU 
not only be free from insects but will 
also keep better. 

To Store lima Beans. — Gather lima 
beans before they rijicn, and while 
they are still tender and green. 
Spread them on cloths in the sun to 
dry. 

To Dry Peas. — Pick over the peas 
and remove any pods that are mil- 
dewed or spotted. Spread the pods 
to dry on cloths in the sun. 

To "store Peas. — Store shelled peas 
in any dry place. They will keep un- 



458 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



less they become infested with wee- 
vils. In that case put them in a tin 
dripping pan, cover, place in a slow 
oven and heat imtil the weevils are 
killed. 

To Dry Corn. — Cut the corn raw 
from the cob and dry it thoroughly 
in pans in an oven. This gives a 
finer flavor than when it is partly 
boiled. 

Or dip green corn on the ear in 
boiling water, remove, and hang up 
the ears until dry in a room where 
there is a free circulation of air. 

Or husk and clean the silk from the 
corn. Place the ears in a colander 
over a kettle of steaming water, and 
steam a half hour or more. Split the 
kernels with a sharp knife, scrape out 
the pulp and dry it on clean tins or 
earthenware platters. Care must be 
taken not to scorch or brown it. 

Or husk and clean the corn, shave 
off the kernels with a sharp knife, 
scrape the remaining pulp from the 
cobs, and lay on earthenware plat- 
ters. Sprinkle i teacupful of sugar 
to each 3 quarts of corn, stir well and 
place in a medium hot oven for ten 
minutes, but do not scorch or brown 
it. Remove and spread to dry in a 
drying rack or under a hotbed sash. 
It should be dried as quickly as pos- 
sible as it deteriorates with exposure. 
Store in tight jars or boxes in a dry 
place. "WTien required for use soak 
it in lukewarm water. 

Or cut the corn from the ear, place 
it in a shallow pan, and set this pan in 
another filled with hot water, after 
the manner of a double boiler. Slowly 
cook in this way till all milk is ab- 
sorbed by the kernels. Finally take 
out and dry gradually in the open air 
or by a stove. Although this requires 
longer than the old way, it is well 
worth while, because the corn tastes 
better. — Mrs. K. A. Krotke. 

Preserving Green Peas. — Shell and 
pick over the peas. Cover them with 
cold water and bring to a boil. Pour 
tliem into a sieve or colander to drain. 
Crush the pea pods in a saucepan or 
run them through a meat cutter, and 
pour over them a little of the water 
in which the peas were boiled. Pack 
the peas into glass jars. Salt the 
juice from the pea pods to taste. 



pour it boiling hot over the peas and 
seal. 

Or shell and pick over the peas, 
place them in a kettle of cold water 
and bring to a boil for two or three 
minutes only. Remove from the boil- 
ing water and let them drip dry. 
Now spread them out on a cloth on 
a table or other smooth surface. Lay 
over them another dry cloth to re- 
move all moisture. Pack them in 
jelly tumblers or fruit jars, and pour 
over them clarified butter or mutton 
suet to the depth of an inch. Tie 
over the top a piece of cotton batting 
and store in a cool place until re- 
quired for use. 

Or shell and pick over the peas 
when full grown, but not hard, and 
dry them in shallow earthenware 
plates in a slow oven. Stir frequently 
and let them dry slowly. When they 
are hard, set them aside to cool and 
pack them in stone jars covered with 
cotton batting. Soak in cold water 
when required for use. 

To Dry Pumpkins. — Prepare the 
ripe fruit, cut into cubes about as 
large as the rind is thick, discarding 
the inner pulp and seeds. Cook until 
soft and squeeze through a colander. 
Dry in a slow oven with the doors 
open, on earthenware plates covered 
to the depth of about an inch. This 
will require eight or ten hours. Store 
the sheets in a dry place and soak 
overnight in milk when required for 
use. 

To Dry Rhubarb. — To dry the 
stalks of rhubarb, first strip off the 
outer skin with a sharp knife. This 
is a painstaking process, but it pays 
as the rhubarb dries more quickly 
and thoroughly. Spread on cloths in 
the sun, preferably under a hotbed 
sash, and dry as quicklj^ as pos- 
sible. 

To Cure Rhubarb Root. — Pull up 
the roots from the old rhubarb bed 
when a new bed has been set out. 
Brush off the earth with a dry brush, 
and cut the roots into squares 2 
inches long. Take off the skin with 
a sharp knife. Bore a hole through 
the middle and run a string through 
them, knotting it so as to keep each 
piece of root separate from the 
others. String these between suitable 



PRESERVATION OF MEAT AND VEGETABLES 459 



posts or pegs upon the ground, and 
expose to the sun to dry. Take them 
indoors at night or when it rains, as 
dampness is apt to cause mold. 

To Dry Parsley. — To have bright, 
crisp parsley, pick it in dry weather. 
Spread it thinly on a jilatter and 
bake it in a moderate oven with the 
doors open, turning frequently. If 
the oven is not too hot, the leaves will 
become dry and brittle without losing 
their green color. Take care that the 
heat is not sufficient to turn the leaves 
brown or they will be spoiled. Now 
rub it to powder between the palms 
of the hands, pick out the stalks, sift 
the powder through a coarse sieve, 
place it in a glass bottle or jar and 
cork tightly. Keep in a dry place. 
A peck or more of the parsley should 
be gathered, as it is reduced very 
much in bulk by drying. The dry 
powder is suitable for most purposes 
for which fresh parsley is employed, 
and is much more convenient. 

To Dry Herbs. — Herbs should be 
gathered in dry weather, carefully 
picked over and dried as quickly as 
possible, either in a slow oven or un- 
der a hotbed sash. They should be 
spread out thin on sheets of blotting 
paper and turned occasionally. Fresh 
herbs are, of course, to be preferred, 
but as they are not obtainable in win- 
ter it is necessary to preserve them 
by drying. 

The season at which herbs are best 
fit to be preserved by drying varies 
with different species. Orange flow- 
ers, elder flowers, parsley and chervil 
in May, June, and July; burnet and 
tarragon in June, July, and August; 
knotted marjoram and mint in July; 
summer savory, July and August; 
basil, winter savory, and lemon thyme, 
the end of July and August. 

The aromatic herbs must not be 
exposed to too great heat, as other- 
wise the essential oils which give them 
their flavor will be volatilized. After 
being dried, the herbs should be 
screened through a large sieve to re- 
move dust and other impurities, the 
stems removed, and the leaves stored 
in glass bottles. All of the above 
herbs will be found useful condiments 
in cookery, and several of them have 
medicinal qualities. These and many 



others can also be obtained of drug- 
gists and other dealers. 

To Gather Roots. — Most medicinal 
and other roots should be gathered in 
the spring and are, as a rule, better 
in the fresh than in the dry state. To 
dry them it is only necessary to brush 
off the dust with a dry brush, rinse 
the roots in cold water, string them 
together and expose them to the heat 
of the sun or in a slow oven until 
bone dry. 

Lath Boxes for Vegetables and 
Fruit. — Cut end pieces of inch thick 
pine stuff 14? inches long and 1:2 
inches deep. Cut laths 17^ inches 
long which will give two pieces for 
each lath. Tack these laths to the 
end pieces to form two sides and the 
bottom, having the thickness of one 
lath between every two. Cut holes 
about 3* inches long and 1 inch or 
more deep in the two ends about 3 
or 4 inches from the top as handles, 
and use these boxes for picking up 
apples, potatoes, onions, and other 
vegetables, and storing them for win- 
ter use. 

Packing' Fruit. — Carefully pick 
over the fruit and discard all wind- 
falls, and specked or wormy speci- 
mens. For an extra fine quality, 
wrap each fruit in tissue paper. 
Pack in clean, dry, flour barrels and 
pour over the top dry sand or road 
dust, shaking it down until the barrel 
is full. Place the barrels in a cellar 
or other cool i:)lace where they will 
not freeze. 

Evaporated Apples. — To dry or 
evaporate apples, peel and core them 
and cut across in thin slices. Let the 
slices fall into cold water to prevent 
their rusting. When all are sliced, 
and in readiness, lay the slices on a 
large piece of cheese cloth and baste 
them to this by means of a darning 
needle and suitable cotton thread, 
taking a stitch through each slice, so 
that it will lie flat and keep in place. 
Suspend the cheese cloth out of doors 
by the four corners to suitable stakes, 
high enough to be out of the reach of 
small animals, spread another thick- 
ness of cheese cloth over the fruit 
and expose to direct sunlight. Be 
sure to take them in before dew 
falls. When sufficiently dry store 



460 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



them in a dark place. This is the 
cheapest and most convenient way to 
dry apples, and the color will be 
nearly equal to that of the commer- 
cial article. 

Or thin trays or slats about i of an 
inch in width" may be tacked together, 
the apples spread on these and cov- 
ered with cheese cloth to prevent the 
fruit turning dark. 

Storing Nuts. — Pack walnuts in 
jars, boxes, or casks between layers of 
fine dry sand. If they have become 
shriveled, let them stand overnight in 
skimmed milk or a solution of milk 
and water. Chestnuts and filberts 
may also be stored in the same 
manner. 



Almonds. — Buy for domestic use 
the sweet almond, as the bitter al- 
mond contains prussic acid which is 
a deadly poison. To freshen almonds 
place them while still in the shells in 
a colander set in a basin of cold wa- 
ter and bring to a boil. Lift them 
out, peel them as quickly as possible 
and drop the kernels into cold water. 
Never leave almonds in boiling water 
to cool as it is likely to make them 
bitter. 

To roast almonds for salting or 
bonbons, put them in an ordinary 
corn popper and shake them over a 
brisk fire. 



CHAPTER XXXIV 

PRESERVING AND CANNING FRUIT 
AND VEGETABLES 

CANNED GOODS FOR THE MARKET — UTENSILS AND MATE- 
RIALS—THE PROCESS — PRESERVES AND PRESERVING — 
SMALL FRUITS — LARGE FRUITS — PUREES AND MARMA- 
LADE — JELLY MAKING — CANNING VEGETABLES 



The art of preserving and canning 
fruit and fresh vegetables is much 
more important than is usually re- 
alized. Preserved fruit is, perhaps, 
most often classed with candy and 
other sweetmeats as an expensive 
luxury. But fruit, properly put up, 
is not necessarily expensive and may 
be regarded as a very essential part 
of the diet especially in winter. The 
value of fruit as food can hardly be 
overestimated. The fruit juices have 
a peculiarly wholesome effect upon 
the digestive organs and tend to keep 
the blood in good condition. They 
also, to a large extent, prevent the 
necessity for cathartic medicines. 
Fresh fruit in season should, of course, 
have the preference, but in winter 
properly canned fruit and preserves 
may take their place with almost 
equally good effect. 

The art of canning fresh vegeta- 
bles in the kitchen has now been so 
perfected that most kinds of garden 
truck may be canned without expense 
other than for jars, labor and fuel. 
All housewives who have not yet at- 
tempted this newly devised process 
will be delighted to discover that 
they can easily preserve such garden 
vegetables as early peas, sweet corn, 
and others, and serve them in mid- 
winter with all their original deli- 
cacy of texture and flavor. The 
value of such a contribution to the 
winter diet is apparent. It not only 
adds to the palatability, aesthetic 



461 



value and wholesomeness of the diet. 
It is also an important measure 
of economy, since by this means 
any surplus of garden products, 
which would have little or no value 
in summer, may be preserved for use 
during the period of greatest scarcity 
and consequent high prices. It is 
safe to say that any housekeeper who 
has a small garden spot at her com- 
mand can easily put up peas, corn 
and other vegetables worth several 
times the cost of this volume every 
year of her life. 

Preserving and Canning. — These 
terms are used somewhat loosely, but 
the word preserves more properly 
applies to the old-fashioned method 
of our grandmothers, which consisted 
in boiling the fruit in sirup after the 
time-honored recipe of " pound for 
pound." This process, to be entirely 
successful, is diflBcult and tedious. 
It is also expensive on account of the 
amount of sugar required. The old- 
fashioned preserves are still favored 
by some, but the easier, quicker and 
cheaper method of canning, or steam- 
ing, has largely deposed them. The 
term "preserves " also covers jams, or 
purees, and marmalade, which are 
fruit, or mixtures of fruit, stewed to 
a smooth paste. 

CANNED GOODS FOR MARKET 

Money in Preserving Fruit. — In 
addition to the importance of pre- 



46^ 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



serving fruit and vegetables for home 
use there is a large and constantly 
increasing market both locally and in 
the large cities for a fine grade of 
homemade canned products. Prices 
ranging from seventy-five cents to 
$1.50 per quart, at retail, for a high 
grade domestic article are not infre- 
quent. After deducting the cost of 
fruit, or vegetables, sugar and other 
materials including jars, rings, bot- 
tle wax, labels, the cost of packing 
and transportation, and the labor 
cost (at a nominal figure, say, ten or 
fifteen cents an hour) for all time 
actually engaged in picking the fruit, 
preserving and packing it, there 
should be a profit of at least 100 per 
cent clear to the maker. And after 
a reputation has been established for 
a product of uniformly high quality, 
even better prices can be realized. 
This is not only a practical way for 
any housekeeper to earn extra pin 
money. In many localities it is the 
only feasible method of marketing 
the fruit and truck crop. 

Ordinarily so much produce ripens 
at about the same time in villages 
and rural communities, that there is 
no sale for it at any price. And the 
comparatively small amount grown 
by one family, together with the dis- 
tance to the nearest market, often 
makes it unprofitable to pack and 
ship the produce as it ripens to a 
commission merchant. But the small- 
est quantities can be gathered and 
canned from day to day during the 
season. Thus a sufficient quantity can 
be accumulated to justify the time 
and cost of packing and shipping by 
freight to the nearest city. 

Or if the quantity is large enough, 
it may be worth while to make a trip 
in person, taking a sample of the 
product, in order to make an advan- 
tageous sale to some large consumer. 
Commission merchants and wholesale 
grocery houses are usually glad to 
buy, at fair prices, all the homemade 
goods of this sort they can obtain. 
But the stewards of the finest hotels 
and clubs, such as the country clubs 
that are springing up all over the 
United States, will often pay fancy 
prices for an especially fine article. 

Even local merchants have a con- 



siderable demand for these goods and 
will sometimes make a special ef- 
fort to sell them for a good cus- 
tomer. Or orders can be secured 
from neighbors by means of an ad- 
vertisement in the local j^aper or by 
tactful solicitation. 

The principal difficulty met in the 
sale of homemade goods is the com- 
mon belief among merchants and 
others that they may not be of uni- 
formly high quality. Factory-made 
goods are nowadays done up with 
scientific care and accuracy. The 
jars are carefully inspected and the 
contents very rarely mold or sour. 

Unless one is willing, therefore, to 
take every step with the most rigid 
and painstaking thoroughness, it is 
useless to attempt to compete with 
the factory product. But once a 
well-deserved reputation has been 
built up, a demand will have been 
created for all that one will ordi- 
narily wish to supply. 

Many women earn a living for 
themselves or contribute largely to 
the family income by thus creating a 
market for all the produce that their 
husbands can grow. INIany others 
find it profitable to buy fruit and 
vegetables from their neighbors, em- 
ploy and carefully train assistants 
and put up hundreds of dollars' 
worth annually. 

To Pack Canned Goods for Mar- 
ket. — Use only the best quality of 
all-glass jars. Do not attempt to 
economize on labels, but obtain the 
most attractive that money will buy. 
A distinctive label is an immensely 
important point in promoting sales 
and building up a reputation for 
one's product. Cement the labels 
neatly and securely in a uniform po- 
sition on the jars. Wrap each jar 
in stout colored wrapping paper, fold 
and seal top and bottom with muci- 
lage, or by means of a label gummed 
over all, and place a label on the 
outside of the wrapper in addition to 
that on the jar itself. 

The best method of packing is to 
obtain from a dealer cylinders of 
the proper size which are made for 
this ])urpose of corrugated cardboard. 
Obtain also a supply of the same 
cardboard to place between the lay- 



PRESERVING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 



463 



ers of jars. If your annual output 
is large enough, suitable cases to hold 
a quarter gross or half gross of jars 
can be made at home, or for a trifle 
by a local carpenter. These will be 
returned by the purchaser on request. 

Or the jars may be packed in stout 
packing cases or barrels and sur- 
rounded with excelsior, straw or hay. 
An excellent method is to place be- 
tween two sheets of thick manila 
paper a layer of excelsior and stitch 
or quilt the whole together at inter- 
vals with long stitches such as are 
used in basting. The whole may then 
be cut with shears to proper lengths, 
between the rows of basting. In 
these wrap up the separate jars. 
Also line the box or barrel with them 
and place one or more thicknesses be- 
tween the different layers of jars. 
In addition crowd excelsior between 
the jars so that no two jars can 
come in contact. 

If packing cases are used, the ex- 
celsior must be crowded in at the 
top so that the contents cannot 
move, and the lids securely nailed on. 
It is easy to ascertain by shaking it 
vigorously whether the case has been 
solidly packed. If any rattling is 
heard, it should be opened and re- 
packed. 

If barrels are used, it is sufBcient 
to take off the top hoop and cover 
the top with a piece of canvas or 
burlap. Replace the hoop over the 
cloth and put on the top a stout 
label marked "Glass, This Side Up, 
With Care." Better care is given a 
package thus left without a head 
than to a sealed box or barrel. 
Place even dozens in each package, 
and be sure to make an accurate 
count. Have a printed billhead and 
promptly notify the consignee of the 
time of shipment by mailing the bill 
with a courteous note. 

To Fix a Price on Canned Goods. — 
Keep account of all time taken in 
picking, preserving or packing the 
produce and figure out what it would 
cost you to hire the work done by 
ordinary day labor. Usually ten or 
fifteen cents an hour is a fair figure. 
Add to this the cost of the produce 
and sugar actually consumed, jars 
and all accessories, including packing 



material, labor, etc. When you have 
thus arrived at the actual cost includ- 
ing labor, double this amount to al- 
low yourself 100 per cent profit. If 
at first you are unable to sell your 
goods at this price or better, it is 
probably because you are inexperi- 
enced. Either you are not taking ad- 
vantage of the work, or others are 
taking advantage of you in the price 
you are paying for labor or material. 
But 100 per cent profit is the ideal 
you should have in view, and some 
persons making homemade canned 
goods realize two or three times as 
much on their investment. 

Storing Preserves. — Canned vege- 
tables, fruits and preserves should 
be stored in a cool, dark, dry place. 
The cellar is not the best place unless 
it is dry and well ventilated. A 
storeroom partitioned off from tlie 
cellar and built of concrete is an 
ideal apartment for this purpose. In 
houses that are heated in winter, a 
dark, airy closet in the upper part of 
the house is a good place. But of 
course, they must not be placed where 
they will freeze in cold weather. If 
it is necessary to store them in an 
ordinary cellar to prevent freezing, 
a swinging shelf should be constructed 
for this purpose. The jars should be 
allowed to become stone cold before 
being stored away. They will keep 
much better if carefully wrapped in 
dark-colored paper folded and pasted 
top and bottom, and labeled on the 
outside so that it will not be neces- 
sary to disturb the wrappers until 
they are required for use. 

UTENSILS AND MATERIALS 

Utensils for Canning. — The most 
useful utensil for canning in consid- 
erable quantities is an ordinary tin 
wash boiler, such as is used in the 
laundry, cut down to convenient size. 
As this utensil will not ordinarily 
have a great deal of wear, a cheap 
tin wash boiler may be purchased, or 
an old wash boiler that has been dis- 
carded may, by means of patches and 
solder, be put into sufficiently good 
order to answer this purpose. Mea.s- 
ure from the bottom of the wash 
boiler to a point four or five inches 



464. 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



higher than the top of an ordinary- 
quart fruit jar, mark a line all 
around at this point, and have a tin- 
smith cut it off on this line. Or you 
can cut it off yourself with a chisel 
and hammer by inserting the end of 
a block of wood and striking against 
this. But it is better to have this 
work done by a tinsmith, and have 
him turn over the sharp edge so that 
you will not cut j'ourself on it. Now 
have a gridiron of wooden slats or 
wires fitted into the bottom in the 
inside. This is to keep the jars off 
the bottom on the principle of the 
double boiler. The result is a utensil 
of the right size for use on an ordi- 
nary range or on two burners of a 
gas or alcohol stove, and of conveni- 
ent depth for sterilizing jars as well 
as canning the produce. 

Or use an ordinary wash boiler 
fitted with a suitable false bottom. 
This has the same advantages, ex- 
cept that it is less convenient to reach 
into its steaming depths when re- 
moving the jars. 

A large porcelain preserving kettle 
holding ten or twelve quarts, a porce- 
lain skimmer and ladle and a long- 
handled stirring spoon of wood are 
also necessary. A pair of scales and 
suitable measuring cup should always 
be at hand in the kitchen. The old- 
fashioned Mason jar is still in use, 
but the so-called lightning jar is 
preferable. Have on hand a suffi- 
cient quantity of new rubber rings. 
Never attempt to use old rings, as 
rubber decays very rapidly, and the 
old ring is almost certain to admit 
the air into the jar, causing the con- 
tents to spoil before it is used. Old 
rings also harbor bacteria that cause 
fermentation. With clean jars and 
new rubber rings, the battle is al- 
ready half over. Other useful de- 
vices in canning, preserving and jelly 
making are the sugar gauge, fruit 
pricker, ordinary wooden vegetable 
masher, wire sieve or colander and 
wire basket. 

To make a fruit pricker cut a 
piece one-half inch deep from a 
broad cork, press through this a 
dozen or more coarse darning nee- 
dles and tack the cork on a piece of 
board. One stroke on this bed of 



needles punctures the fruit with a 
dozen holes. But be sure to use 
large, strong needles and take care 
that none of the points are broken 
off and remain in the fruit. Remove 
the cork from the board, and wash 
and dry thoroughly after using. A 
little olive or sweet oil on the nee- 
dles will prevent rusting. 

The sirup gauge and glass cylin- 
der are essential to uniform success 
in making jelly. These may be ob- 
tained from any druggist at a cost 
of about 75 cents. A cylinder with 
a lip holding a little over a gill is the 
best size. The sirup gauge is a glass 
tube with a weighted bulb so gradu- 
ated as to register 0° to 50°. To use 
the sirup gauge, fill the glass cylinder 
to about two-thirds of its height with 
a sample of the liquid to be tested. 
Insert the gauge and the quantity of 
sugar present, if any, will be regis- 
tered. In pure water the bulb will 
rest on the bottom. The more sirup 
is dissolved in the water the higher 
the gauge will rise. When testing hot 
liquids, the gauge and cylinder must 
be heated gradually to avoid break- 
ing. The fruit juice or sirup either 
for canning, preserving or making 
jellies may thus be tested at any stage. 
The sirup may be made heavier by 
adding sugar or lighter by adding 
water as the case demands. 

Glass Jars. — It is conceded by 
most women that glass jars are the 
most desirable and economical for use 
in canning for home use, as they can 
be used from year to year, or indef- 
initely, by simply adding new rub- 
bers and tops each year. Practic- 
ally all of the various types of glass 
jars available on the market can be 
successfully used in the canning of 
fruits, vegetables, and meats by the 
" cold-pack " method. 

In the handling of all glass-top jars 
having top and clamp springs, it is 
important to remember that the rub- 
ber, cap, and top spring are put in 
place, while the lower clamp spring 
is left up, or raised, during the entire 
period of sterilization and then low- 
ered and completely closed after ster- 
ilization. 

In handling the screw-top jar it is 
important to remember that the rub- 



PRESERVING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 



465 



ber and top are put in place and the 
top turned until it touches the rub- 
ber, sealing the jar partially, but not 
so closely as to prevent the escape of 
excessive or expanded air. 

When using glass jars always utilize 
the jars you have on hand, but when 
you buy new jars, buy the best. They 
are the cheapest in the long run. No 
glass jar with raetal or rubber in di- 
rect contact with the food product is 
desirable unless the caj) is enameled, 
lacquered, or vulcanized. Glass jars 
should be thoroughly cleaned and 
should be taken directly from hot 
water to be filled. 

Canned products in glass jars, if ex- 
posed to light, will bleach, fade, and 
sometimes deteriorate in food value; 
hence the necessity of wrapping in 
paper. 

Breakage of Jars. — When break- 
age of jars occurs it is due to such 
causes as: 

Overpacking the jars. Corn, pump- 
kin, lima beans, and sweet potatoes 
swell or expand in processing. Do 
not fill the jars quite full of these 
products. 

Placing the cold jars in hot water or 
vice versa. As soon as the jars are 
filled with hot syrup or hot water, 
place them immediately in the canner. 

Having the wire bail of glass-top 
jars too tight. 

Allowing a cold draft to strike the 
jars when they are removed from the 
canner. 

Having the wire bail too tight, thus 
breaking the jars when the lever is 
forced down. 

Defective Jars. — The following 
are valuable tests for screw-top jars: 

Place the top on the jar without 
the rubber. Turn it down tight. If 
the thumb nail can be inserted be- 
tween the top and the glass, the top 
is usually defective. 

Place the rubber and the cap in 
position and screw them down lightly. 
Pull the rubber from its position. 
Release it. If the rubber returns to 
its position between the top and the 
jar, the top is defective. 

Tests for Glass-Top Jars. — Place 
the glass top on the jar without the 
rubber. Tap around the outer edge 



of the top with the finger. If the top 
rocks, it is defective. The wire bail 
placed over the top of the cover 
should go in with a snap, even when 
the tightening lever or the clamp 
spring is up. If it does not, remove 
the bail from the tightening lever and 
bend it to make it tight. This tighten- 
ing of the bail should be done every 
year. 

Rubbers. — A good rubber will 
stand considerable pulling and jerk- 
ing and will return to its original 
shape. A good rubber will also stand 
several hours of boiling in a hot-water- 
bath outfit without being affected. 

Alcohol Stove. — A proper stove is 
a very important consideration. Prod- 
uce is ordinarily ready for canning 
in sultry weather, and the heat of a 
cook stove or range is so unbearable 
that the process rarely receives the 
quality of skill and the degree of at- 
tention that the best results demand. 
A tired and overheated housekeeper 
is in no mood to closely observe the 
delicate points that contribute to the 
perfection of a high grade product. 
Housekeepers fortunate enough to en- 
joy the use of gas will need no sugges- 
tion to use a gas range for canning 
fruit, and at a time when the oven 
burners are not lighted. But where 
there is no available supply of gas a 
two-burner stove consuming dena- 
tured alcohol is especially recommend- 
ed. This is self-contained and porta- 
ble. Thus the whole apparatus for 
canning fruit can be moved into a 
large, cool room, into an outhouse, or 
if desired in still, clear, or sultry 
weather, out of doors on the veranda, 
or in the shade of a tree on the 
lawn. At all events, an effort should 
be made to " keep cool " in both 
senses, if one is ambitious to obtain 
the best possible results. 

Materials for Canning and Pre- 
serving. — The materials used for 
canning and preserving should in- 
variably be of the finest quality. 
Only the best grade of white granu- 
lated sugar should be used. And 
this should be clarified as described 
under candy making. Fresh, ripe 
fruit and vegetables of the best 
quality should be selected and care- 



466 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



fully picked over. All bruised, 
specked, or wormeaten specimens 
should be discarded. Small fruits, 
as raspberries and strawberries, and 
all vegetables, should be canned if 
possible the morning they are picked. 
Great care should be taken in hand- 
ling produce to avoid bruising it. A 
silver paring knife should be used 
for fruit as an iron or steel knife 
tends to darken it. The fruit when 
pared should be instantly dropped 
into a vessel of clear cold water, care 
being taken that it is not bruised in 
falling. This prevents the fruit from 
" rusting " or turning dark by expo- 
sure to the air. All hard portions 
should be removed as they resist the 
effects of heat. And all " specks " or 
decayed portions since they injure the 
flavor and color. 

The best quality of canned fruit is 
obtained by heating fruit in the jars 
as hereafter described. This method 
avoids bruising the fruit by stirring, 
lifting, or pouring it from one ves- 
sel to another. Particular attention 
and care when preparing all canned 
goods will be amply repaid in the 
improved quality of the product. If 
fruit is pared, the work should be 
done thoroughly and no particles of 
skin allowed to remain. If the cores, 
pits, or stones are removed at all, 
the work should be done in a pains- 
taking manner. Especially if the 
goods are offered for sale, a small 
fraction of additional labor at the 
start will add largely to the price 
and salability of the product. For 
similar reasons only the best quality 
of spices, brandy, or other condi- 
ments should be used, 

PROCESS or CANNING AND PRE- 
SERVING 

Nature of the Process. — Canning 
or preserving is a process of killing, 
by means of heat, the germs that 
cause decay and preventing the con- 
tact of other germs by covering the 
produce with boiling sirup and seal- 
ing it hermetically so as to exclude 
the air. The reason that boiling is 
necessary, is that the germs of decay 
may be already present in the sub- 
stance of the produce itself. Hence 



it must be boiled until the heat has 
penetrated every part and effectually 
destroyed the germs. And the rea- 
son that air must be excluded is that 
the microscopic germs that cause pu- 
trefaction float in the air in very 
large numbers. Hence if a bubble of 
air remains among the fruit, or if 
air is admitted through a crevice as 
fine as a needle point in the rubber 
ring or metal top of the jar, putre- 
faction will certainly result. 

Other substances such as clear wa- 
ter or fruit juices exclude the air 
as well as sugar sirup. Sugar is 
added partly because it makes the 
product more palatable and nutri- 
tious, and partly because the pres- 
ence of sugar is unfavorable to bac- 
terial growth. Hence the amount of 
sugar to be added to a given quan- 
tity of fruit may be varied at will. 
The old-time rule for " preserving " 
was pound for pound, but this is by 
no means necessarily an invariable 
principle. The present tendency is 
in favor of " canning." The pound- 
for-pound preserves are regarded by 
many as unnecessarily sweet and ex- 
pensive. A much thinner sirup is 
commonly used in canning and, pro- 
vided proper precautions are taken, 
preserves the fruit equally well. Or, 
if desired, fruits and fruit juices 
and in fact any kind of vegetable, 
may be canned without the addition 
of any sugar at all. 

To sum up, the produce must be 
thoroughly boiled through and through. 
The jars must be filled to overflow- 
ing with boiling hot sirup or other 
liquid so that all bubl)les of air will 
be excluded. Then they must be in- 
stantly sealed, else the contents will 
cool slightly and leave a sjiace filled 
with bacteria-laden air between the 
top and the jar cover. The jar must 
be provided with a tight ring of 
new rubber or other substance that 
will absolutely exclude the air or 
the bacteria that it contains. Such 
substances as blotting paper and cot- 
ton batting are sometimes used for 
the reason that they have the prop- 
erty of screening or filtering the air 
so as to prevent bacteria from pass- 
ing through. 

Methods of Canning and Preserv- 



PRESERVING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 



467 



ing Fruit. — There are two different 
ways of canning or preserving fruit, 
either of which will give satisfactory 
results: (1) steaming the fruit in the 
jars or cans, or {-2) boiling it in 
a preserving kettle. The old-time 
method of " preserving " consisted in 
boiling the fruit in a suitable pre- 
serving kettle, in sugar sirup, lift- 
ing it from the sirup when sufficient- 
ly boiled, packing it into jars or cans 
and pouring the boiling sirup over 
it. This method is still preferred by 
many. 

The modern method of " canning " 
consists in packing the fruit in the 
cans or jars without sugar, or with 
sugar sprinkled between the differ- 
ent layers at the rate of about one 
tablespoonful to each pound of fruit, 
placing the jars on the stove in a 
suitable receptacle surrounded by 
water, bringing the water to a boil 
and finally filling the cans with boil- 
ing sugar sirup and sealing them. 

The canning or steaming method is 
somewhat slower unless a large re- 
ceptacle is provided in which to place 
a considerable number of fruit jars 
while boiling. But the process is 
easier and is likely to give a more 
satisfactory result. All bubbles of air 
are driven out of the fruit while 
steaming. And the jar itself is uni- 
formly heated, so that when boiling 
sirup is added to fill it to the brim, 
it does not shrink by cooling in the 
moment of time required to clap on 
the cover and seal. Then, too, the 
fruit is undisturbed, and its shape, 
color, and texture are not injured. 

Preserving Day. — Many house- 
keepers prefer, when putting up 
fruits for home use, to prepare a 
jar or two each day, selecting the 
finest fruits as they ripen. Thus the 
labor is distributed over the season 
and associated with other cooking 
from day to day so as to be hardly 
realized. But it is of some advan- 
tage, when a considerable quantity of 
fruit is to be preserved, to get every- 
thing in readiness at one time and 
make a day of it. 

To Test Jars. — The contents of 
several jars may be saved in the 
course of a season by testing the 
jars before using. To this end, fill 



them with warm water, put on the 
new rubber rings that are to be used, 
seal them and stand them upside 
down on a large sheet of blotting pa- 
per. Or butcher's brown paper, or 
an ordinary folded newspaper, will 
answer. If there is the slightest leak, 
the water will trickle out and be seen 
on the absorbent paper. Thus de- 
fective rubber rings, or uneven, 
nicked, or cracked jar tops can be 
discarded and assurance can be had 
that no valuable material and labor 
will be wasted. Similarly, it is a 
good plan to turn the filled jars up- 
side down on absorbent paper and 
let them stand overnight before stor- 
ing them away. If by chance a de- 
fective ring or jar has been used it 
will be detected and the contents can 
be transferred to another jar. 

To Sterilize Jars. — The first step 
is to place in the special boiler above 
mentioned, or in a preserving kettle, 
the jars that are to be used, with 
about one tablespoonful of borax to 
twelve quarts of cold water, and 
bring them to a boil over a slow fire. 
The tops should be put in place and 
boiled with the jars themselves. But 
the rubber rings must not be boiled 
as this will harden the rubber and 
make it unfit for use. Jars having 
glass tops should invariably be given 
the preference. This will effectually 
kill all germs, free the jars from dust 
and dirt, and also toughen them so 
that, if properly handled, they will 
not crack in the process of canning. 
After they have boiled fifteen minutes 
or so, pour off the borax water and 
pour over them hot water to rinse 
them. Care must, of course, be taken 
not to pour cold water over hot jars, 
or expose them to a draught of cold 
air while hot, or they may be cracked 
and broken. 

Canning Fruit. — After the jars 
have been thus rinsed and sterilized, 
replace them on the stove in the 
above-mentioned boiler or other suit- 
able receptacle, surround them with 
hot water, and pack in the fruit, 
either without sugar, or with sugar 
sprinkle among the layers of fruit 
at the rate of one tablespoonful to 
a pound of fruit up to a teacupful 
to each can, more or less, as desired. 



468 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Boil until the fruit is soft enough 
so that a straw can be run through 
it. The time required will vary ac- 
cording to the fruit, from a few min- 
utes in the case of small fruits, as 
raspberries, strawberries, and others, 
to an hour or more in the case of hard 
pears, quinces, and the like. But ob- 
serve that the latter cannot be cooked 
properly in the cans. They must be 
done up in the preserving kettle in 
the old-fashioned way. And there 
is the less objection as their firmer 
texture protects them from being in- 
jured by handling. 

Berries and small fruits of soft 
and delicate texture, undoubtedly 
present a better appearance and have 
a finer flavor and color if cooked in 
the can. These include cherries, 
strawberries, raspberries, huckleber- 
ries or blueberries, ripe peaches, sum- 
mer pears, and ripe plums. 

Some fruits cooked in the can with 
sugar, shrink and leave the can only 
partly full. Do not attempt to 
crowd the cans when first filled as 
this will crush the fruit and injure 
its appearance. Remove one can and 
gently pour its contents into the tops 
of the others until all are full. Fin- 
ally, when sufficiently boiled, remove 
the jars one by one, wrapping a 
towel about each; place the jar on a 
plate, or in an agate basin, to catch 
the overflow, pour boiling sirup on 
top until it runs over and instantly 
seal before the contents cool, and 
air is admitted. Place the jars in a 
warm place and out of a draught, as 
otherwise they may crack in the proc- 
ess of cooling. 

Sirup for Canning: and Preserv- 
ing, — The strength of the sirup to 



be used in filling jars after the fruit 
has been cooked in them is a matter 
of individual preference. It also de- 
pends upon the amount of sugar, if 
any, that has been sprinkled in the 
fruit while cooking. 

The old time pound-for-pound rule 
called for i a pint of water more 
or less, for each pound of sugar and 
pound of fruit, according to the 
amount of juice in the fruit. But a 
larger amount of water is more com- 
monly used at present. To prepare 
sirup, place the sugar in a small pre- 
serving kettle, pour the required 
amount of cold water over it and stir 
until the sugar is fully dissolved be- 
fore placing on the fire. The sirup 
will be clarified and improved by the 
addition of a little gum arabic or 
white of egg. The scum, as fast as 
it rises, may tlien be removed with 
a skinuner, taking all impurities with 
it. This sirup may be poured over 
the fruit after it has been cooked 
in the can. 

Or according to the earlier method, 
the fruit may be dropped into the 
clarified sirup while at a boiling 
point, cooked until it is tender, re- 
moved with a skimmer, packed in 
the jars and the boiling sirup added 
until they are filled to overflowing. 

Making Sugar Sirups. 

Unsatisfactory results frequently 
follow from the use of a sirup which 
is not of the density best suited to the 
particular purpose for which it is 
employed. Sugar sirups are made by 
boiling sugar and water together to a 
certain density, expressed as " de- 
gree " or " per cent." This may be 
accurately measured by a density

gauge, and it is advisable always to 
have one at hand. But in the absence 
of a suitable gauge, sirup of any re- 
quired density may be made by refer- 
ence to the foregoing sirup table, 
which is computed on the number of 
pounds of sugar in 100 pounds of so- 
lution, and, therefore, is called a " per 
cent, table." 

A formula much used in the West 
for sirup is 3 quarts of sugar to 2 
quarts of water, boiled to a thin, me- 
dium-thin, medium-thick, or thick 
sirup. Another fornmla, sometimes 
called the Eastern formula, is 3 quarts 
of water to 2 quarts of sugar, boiled 
to a thin, medium-thin, medium-thick, 
or thick sirup. 

Approximate Density Terms Ex- 
plained. 

Thin Sirup is sugar and water 
boiled sufficiently to dissolve all sugar ; 
but is not sticky. 

Medium thin sirup is that which has 
begun to thicken and becomes sticky 
when cooled on the finger tip or spoon. 

Medium thick sirup is that which 
has thickened enough to roll or pile 
up over the edge of a spoon when 
you try to pour it out. 

Thick sirup is that which has be- 
come so thick that it is difficult to 
pour out of a spoon or container (not 
sugared). 

Thin sirups are used for all sweet 
fruits that are not too delicate in tex- 
ture and color, such as cherries, 
peaches, apples, etc. 

Medium-thin sirups are used in the 
canning of the medium-sweet fruits, 
such as blackberries, currants, dew- 
berries, huckleberries, raspberries, etc. 

Medium-thick sirups are used in the 
canning of all sour fruits, such as 
gooseberries, apricots, sour apples, 
etc., and delicately colored fruits, such 
as strawberries and red raspberries. 

Thick sirup is used in preserving 
and in making all kinds of sun pre- 
serves. 

PRESERVES AND PRESERVING 

Preserving Fruit. — The process of 
preserving is a very simple one, al- 
though it takes a large amount of 



time and great care. However, any 
housekeeper can accompUsh it. The 
principal secret of success is that the 
fruit should be put up and sealed 
while hot and the jars filled to the 
brim. It is usually the custom to 
place the fruit in the kettle, a layer 
of fruit and a layer of sugar, pound 
for pound or measure for measure 
and to let the whole come to a boil 
at once. 

Or place the fruit in a vessel with- 
out the sugar. Put just enough wa- 
ter over it to keep it from scorching, 
and allow it to boil until the scum 
rises. Carefully skim away the scum 
while it continues to rise before add- 
ing the sugar. jMany seem to think 
that the scum rises entirely from 
the sugar, but the experience of those 
who have used the above-mentioned 
method is that an equal amount of 
scum comes from the boiling fruit. 

Or weigh the sugar and the fruit, 
pound for pound, then place the 
sugar in the kettle without the fruit. 
Put in just enough water to dis- 
solve the sugar and stir until it is 
dissolved. Now place on the fire and 
let come to a boil. Continue to sim- 
mer for half an hour or so before 
dipping in the fruit, being careful to 
skim away the scum as it rises. Then 
I^lace the fruit in the boiling liquid 
and let it continue to simmer on the 
back of the stove until the fruit be- 
comes thoroughly impregnated with 
the sirup. 

When about half done lift the fruit 
from the boiling sirup, place it in 
large porcelain or other vessels, be- 
ing careful not to allow any sirup to 
come with it, and place it in the 
sun for an hour or more to bleach. 
After this, again drop the fruit into 
the sirup and let it boil until tender 
enough to allow a straw to run 
through it. 

When the fruit is thoroughly done, 
if the sirup is not as thick as desired, 
it may continuously simmer until the 
desired thickness is reached. Then 
place the fruit in glass jars that 
have been previously heated and ster- 
ilized by boiling in water containing 
a little borax and rinsing in hot wa- 
ter. After filling the jar with fruit 
as full as you conveniently can, pour 



470 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



in the boiling sirup until it fills up 
all the crevices between the fruit, 
excluding all the air possible. While 
performing this process, place the 
jar in a pan filled with hot water. 
This will i^revent cracking the jar, 

SCALDING, BLANCHING AND COLD 
DIPPING 

The terms scalding and blanching, 
as applied to canning, both refer to 
a preliminary heating of the product, 
but are not usually interchangeable. 
The word scalding signifies in this 
connection, dipping in boiling water 
for a very brief space, chiefly for 
three reasons: to loosen the skins, to 
remove objectionable acids and bit- 
ter flavors, and to start a flow of 
coloring matter, to be later arrested 
or coagulated by the cold dip. The 
term blanching applies to a much 
longer period of preliminary cooking. 
Its objects are in part the same as 
those of scalding, namely, to eliminate 
sourness and bitter flavors. But 
blanching is also practiced in part to 
reduce the bulk of succulent vege- 
tables such as cabbage, greens, and 
the like, and in part as preparation — 
in connection with the cold dipping — 
for the sterilization process. 

Every one knows that sudden and 
extreme changes of temperature are 
injurious to living things, and this is 
the philosophy that underlies the 
blanching and cold dipping process. 
The fruit or vegetable to be canned is 
first blanched — i.e., partially cooked 
— from 1 to 15 minutes, depending 
upon the kind and condition in hot 
water or live steam, and then re- 
moved quickly from this and plunged 
forthwith into cold water. The result- 
ing shock very greatly weakens the 
resistance of tlie bacteria, spores, and 
molds tliat cause canned goods to 
spoil, and thus adds to the eflBcacy of 
the steriUzation process. Hence if 
blanching and colcl dipping are prac- 
ticed the period of sterilization can be 
shortened, with the result that the 
product will be much better because 
not over-cooked. It will be more true 
to nature in color, flavor, and texture, 
and more natural in appearance. The 



cold dipping following the blanching 
process also hardens the pulp under 
the skin so as to permit the removal 
of the skin without injury to the pulp, 
and coagulates the coloring matter so 
that it is less likely to dissolve during 
the sterilization period. 

Fruits may be classified for con- 
venience with reference to the blanch- 
ing and cold dipping process into 
four groups or classes, i.e., soft fruits, 
sour-berry fruits, hard fruits, and 
citrus fruits. The blanching and dip- 
ping process is not advisable for soft 
fruits such as strawberries, blackber- 
ries, dewberries, sweet cherries, blue- 
berries, peaches, apricots, etc. But 
sour-berry fruits such as currants, 
gooseberries, cranberries, and sour 
cherries should be blanched in hot 
water 1 minute; hard fruits, such as 
apples, i^ears, quinces, etc., 1^ min- 
utes; and citrus fruits, such as or- 
anges, 1^ minutes. Most vegetables 
should be blanched for a considerable 
length of time. After blanching, 
fruits and vegetables should be forth- 
with plunged quickly into cold water, 
then packed cold in the can, fruit jar, 
or other container, and sterilized for 
the required length of time. 

CANNING SMALL FRUITS 

The method of canning such small 
fruits as raspberries, blackberries, 
currants, gooseberries and blueber- 
ries, is substantially the same except 
for the proportions of berries, sugar 
and water required. Select fruit 
just before it is perfectly ripe — 
choosing an underripe rather than 
overripe fruit — and can promptly 
while freshly picked. Discard all 
imperfect fruit. Gnarled, broken or 
otherwise defective specimens, not de- 
cayed, may be used for marmalade 
or jellies. Avoid berries having a 
large proportion of seeds to pulp and 
if no other can be obtained — as may 
happen during a dry season — remove 
the seeds by rubbing through a 
sieve and preserve the strained pulp 
as marmalade or puree. Pick over 
the berries, hull and stem them and 
drop the perfect fruit in small quan- 
tities into a colander. Rinse in cold 



PRESERVING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 



471 



water and turn them on a sieve to 
drain. Do this quickly so that the 
fruit will not absorb too much water. 

Have ready two bowls, one for 
sugar and one for fruit. Observe 
how much of each will be required 
to fill the preserving kettle or the 
number of jars desired. Measure 
the fruit into the proper bowl as fast 
as it is picked over and washed, and 
for each measure of fruit add to the 
other bowl the proportionate amount 
of sugar. When the required quan- 
tity of fruit and sugar has been 
measured, put both into the preserv- 
ing kettle, add the required amount 
of water, if any, and while the first 
kettle is cooking prepare the fruit 
and sugar for another. Fruit de- 
signed to be served as sauce may 
have any proportion of sugar cooked 
with it according to taste, or if in- 
tended for beverages or cooking pur- 
poses, it may be canned without the 
addition of sugar. Juicy fruits re- 
quire little or no water, except when 
cooked in a heavy sirup. The above 
are general rules which require to be 
modified for particular fruits as fol- 
lows: 

For raspberries and blackberries 
use 2 quarts of sugar to 12 quarts of 
fruit. First express the juice from 
2 quarts of the fruit by heating it 
slowly on the stove in the preserving 
kettle, crushing with a wooden vege- 
table masher and squeezing through 
cheese cloth. Rinse the preserving 
kettle, pour into it the strained 
juice, add the sugar, heat and stir 
until the sugar is dissolved. Let the 
sirup come to a boil, add the remain- 
ing 10 quarts of berries and heat 
slowly. Boil ten minutes from the 
time it begins to bubble and skim 
carefully while boiling. Can and seal 
as above directed. 

For currants the process is the 
same as for raspberries and black- 
berries, but the proportions are dif- 
ferent, namely: 4 quarts of sugar to 
12 of fruit. For raspberries and 
currants combined use 2^ quarts of 
sugar to 3 quarts of currants and 10 
quarts of raspberries. First express 
the juice from the currants as above 
directed, then proceed as for rasp- 
berries. 



For green gooseberries use li 
quarts of sugar and 1 pint of water 
to 6 quarts of fruit. Dissolve the 
sugar in the water, add the fruit and 
cook fifteen minutes. Or can the 
same as rhubarb. For ripe goose- 
berries use only one-half as much 
water. 

For blueberries use 1 quart of 
sugar and 1 pint of water to 12 
quarts of berries. Put all together 
in the preserving kettle and heat 
slowly. Boil fifteen minutes from the 
time the mixture begins to bubble. 

For cherries use li quarts of 
sugar and i pint of water to 6 
quarts of fruit. Measure after stem- 
ming. Stone or not as preferred, but 
if the stones are removed, take care 
to save the juice. First stir the sugar 
into the water over the fire until 
dissolved, then add the cherries and 
bring slowly to a boil. Let boil ten 
minutes, skimming carefully. 

For grapes use 1 quart of sugar 
and 1 gill of water to 6 quarts of 
fruit. First squeeze the pulp from 
the skins. Cook it five minutes and 
rub through a fine sieve to remove 
the seeds. Now bring the water, 
skins and pulp slowly to a boil. 
Skim, stir in the sugar and boil fif- 
teen minutes. If the grapes are 
sweeter or more sour than ordinary, 
use more or less sugar, accordip<^ to 
taste. 

Rhubarb may be cooked and 
canned with sugar in the same man- 
ner as gooseberries, or either rhu- 
barb or gooseberries may be canned 
without heat as follows: Cut the 
rhubarb when young and tender, wash 
thoroughly, pare and divide into pieces 
about two inches long. Pack in ster- 
ilized jars, fill to overflowing with 
cold water and let stand ten minutes. 
Drain off the water and once more 
fill to overflowing with fresh cold 
water. Seal with sterilized rings and 
covers. When the cans are opened the 
rhubarb may be used in all respects 
the same as if fresh. 

CANNING LARGE FRUIT 

Such large fruit as apples, pears, 
peaches and quinces must usually be 
pared and cored before canning. Se- 



472 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



lect first class fruit just before it 
is ripe — preferably underri])e ratber 
than overripe — and discard all im- 
perfect specimens. It is better not 
to can or preserve spotted or bruised 
fruit, but if such are used, all de- 
cayed or bruised spots must be freely 
cut out. Measure the fruit as soon as 
it is pared and cored into a large bowl 
containing cold water made slightly 
acid with lemon juice at the rate 
of one tablespoonful to the quart. 
This will keep the fruit from turning 
brown. For each measure add the 
proportionate quantity of sugar into 
another bowl until the amount of fruit 
and sugar needed to fill the preserv- 
ing kettle or required number of jars 
is at hand. 

Large, hard fruits such as apples, 
pears, quinces, etc., after having been 
pared, quartered, and cored should 
be placed in a wire basket or col- 
ander and blanched 1^ minutes, for 
reasons previously stated, then cold 
dipped by being plunged quickly into 
cold water. 

To peel peaches, plums or toma- 
toes, have ready a deep kettle a 
little more than half full of boiling 
water. Fill a wire basket or colan- 
der with the fruit and suspend it 
by means of a string through the 
handles, or otherwise, in the boiling 
water for three minutes. Now re- 
move and plunge the basket for a 
moment into a pan of cold water. 
Let drain a few moments and peel. 
The process of canning in general 
is much the same for all fruits, but 
the following special modifications 
for particular fruits may be ob- 
served: 

For peaches and ripe pears use 
1 quart of sugar and 3 quarts of 
water to 8 quarts of fruit. Prepare 
the fruit either whole or in halves 
as desired. If the latter, remove all 
the pits except a few in each jar 
which retain for the sake of their 
flavor. Stir the sugar into the water 
over the fire until dissolved and bring 
slowly to a boil. Skim carefully and 
let stand where it will remain hot but 
not boil. Put only a single layer of 
the prepared fruit in the preserving 
kettle at a time and cover with some 
of the hot sirup. Bring slowly to a 



boil, skim carefully, boil gently for 
ten minutes, or longer if not fully 
ripe, can and seal. The fruit is not 
done until it can be readily pierced 
with a straw or a silver fork. Un- 
ripe or hard pears will require much 
longer boiling. 

For quinces use IJ quarts of 
sugar and 2 quarts of water to 4 
quarts of fruit. Rub the fruit hard 
with a coarse crash towel. Then 
wash and drain. Pare, quarter and 
core and drop the pieces into cold 
water acidulated with lemon juice. 
Cover the fruit in the preserving ket- 
tle with plenty of cold water, bring 
slowly to a boil and let sinuner until 
tender. Remove the pieces one by 
one as soon as they can readily be 
pierced with a silver fork and let 
drain on a platter. Now strain the 
water in which the fruit was cooked 
through cheese cloth and put 2 
quarts of the strained liquid over 
the fire. Stir in the sugar until dis- 
solved, bring slowly to a boil, skim 
well, add the cooked fruit and boil 
gently for about twenty minutes. 

For crab-apples use 1^ quarts of 
sugar and 2 quarts of water to 6 
quarts of apples. A part of the stem 
may be left on the fruit if desired, 
but wash carefully and especially rub 
well the blossom end. Stir the sugar 
into the water over the fire until dis- 
solved, bring slowly to a boil, skim, 
add the fruit and cook gently from 
twenty to fifty minutes, or until ten- 
der, depending upon the kind of fruit. 

For plums use 2 quarts of sugar 
and 1 pint of water to 8 quarts of 
fruit. Wash and drain the fruit and 
remove the skins if desired as above 
suggested. Or if they are left on, 
prick them thoroughly with a fruit 
pricker to prevent bursting. Stir the 
sugar into the water over the fire 
until dissolved, bring to a boil and 
carefully skim. Add the fruit in 
small quantities one or two layers at 
a time, cook five minutes, can and 
seal and so continue, adding more 
sirup from time to time if necessary. 

CANNING APPLES 

To l)e jible to transform windfall 
and cull apples into a valuable and 



PRESERVING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 473 



palatable food product, available for 
home consumption throughout the 
year as well as for the commercial 
market, is a great advantage worth 
the consideration of all apple growers. 
In addition to the use of such apples 
for making apple sauce, cider, cider 
vinegar, apple jelly, apple preserves, 
apple butters, and similar products, 
new recipes admit of using windfalls 
and culls profitably for various other 
purposes; as, canning the apples 
whole, sliced for pie filling, or quar- 
tered for fruit salads; the steriliza- 
tion of cider so as to keep it sweet and 
unfermented throughout the year; and 
a method of making apple sirup. The 
recipe for this sirup was furnished 
by Mr. H. C. Gore, of the U. S. Bu- 
reau of Chemistry. 

The windfall and cull apples may 
be divided into two grades. The first 
grade would include the whole, reason- 
ably sound, fruit; the second grade, 
the worm-eaten, partially decayed, 
and injured fruit. Do not can any in- 
jured or decayed part nor allow ap- 
ples to become overripe before can- 
ning. 

Canning Whole, Reasonably Firm, 
Apples. — Wash apples. Remove core 
and blemishes. Place whole apples in 
blanching tray or blanching cloth, and 
blanch in boiling water for two min- 
utes. Remove and plunge quickly into 
cold water. Pack in large, empty 
glass jars. Pour over the product a 
hot thin sirup of about 18° density. 
Place rubber and top in position. 
Seal partially, not tight. Process 
half-gallon or gallon containers 20 
minutes in boiling hot water. Re- 
move jars, tighten covers, invert to 
cool, and test joints. Wrap in paper, 
and store. The time of heating will 
have to be varied according to ripe- 
ness and condition of the fruit. Use 
just time enough to sterilize per- 
fectly, and yet not enough to change 
the color or reduce the pulp to 
sauce. 

Firm and tart apples may be cored 
and peeled first, then canned by the 
above recipe. 

Apples so canned may be used as 
follows: (1) As a breakfast dish, 
with cream and sugar added; (2) 



baked, like fresh apples for break- 
fast or for other meals; (3) in ap- 
ple salad, often served for lunch or 
supper; (4) as a relish with roast 
pork — the api)les may be fried in 
the pork fat or the cores may be 
cooked with roast pork for flavoring; 
(5) in apple dumplings, deep apple 
pie, and other desserts in which 
whole apples are desirable; or (6) 
the sirup of canned whole apples can 
be used for pudding sauces or fruit 
drinks. 

Canning Apples for Pie Filling. — 
Use second grade of windfalls or 
culls. Wash, core, pare, and remove 
all decayed or injured spots. Slice 
apples quickly into a basin containing 
slightly salted cold water (about 1 
teaspoonful per gallon) to keep from 
discoloring. Pack fresh cold product 
in glass jars. Add one cupful of hot, 
thin sirup of about 18° density to 
each quart of fruit. If using glass 
cans, put on the rubbers, and screw 
on the tops, but do not seal com- 
pletely. Sterilize 12 minutes in hot- 
water bath. Remove jars, tighten 
covers, invert to cool, and test joint. 
Wrap in paper, and store. 

This filling can be used for making 
apple pies in the same way that fresh 
apples would be used, with the ex- 
ception that the sirup must be poured 
off, and less sugar should be used. 
Since the apples have already been 
cooked, only enough heat is needed to 
cook the crust and to warm the apples 
through. Pies may be baked in 7 
minutes. The apple pies made with 
these apples are, in the opinion of 
many housekeepers, as good as those 
made with fresh fruit, and have the 
advantages that they can be made in 
less time and are less expensive. 

Canning Quartered Apples for 
Fruit Salads. — Select best grade of 
culls of firm and rather tart varieties. 
Core, pare, and quarter. Drop into 
a basin containing slightly salted cold 
water. Pack these quartered pieces 
tightly in glass jars. Add a teacup- 
ful of thin, hot sirup to each quart. 
Place rubber and top in position, 
partially seal, but not tight. Ster- 
ilize 12 minutes in hot-water bath. 
Remove jars, tighten covers, invert 



474. 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



to cool, and test joint. Wrap in 
paper, and store. 

Canning Sweet Apple Cider. — Fill 
fruit jars with the fresh apple cider. 
Add a tablespoonful of sugar to each 
quart. Place rubber and cap in posi- 
tion and partially tighten. Sterilize 
in hot-water bath for 10 minutes. 
Remove jars, tighten cover, invert to 
cool, and test joint. If you desire the 
apple cider to be a little tart or 
slightly fermented, it will be neces- 
sary to let it stand for two or three 
days before you sterilize, and then 
add about two minutes in the hot 
water. 

Reducing' Sweet Apple Cider to 
Sirup. — It may not be practical for 
the average fruit farmer to make ap- 
ple sirup as a commercial proposition, 
but during seasons when there are a 
large number of culls and windfalls, 
when markets are glutted, and there 
is no profitable market for apples, it 
is a matter of business economy to 
utilize by-products and the making 
of apple sirup for the family's winter 
use is quite worth while. Wash ap- 
ples, remove all decayed and worm- 
eaten spots, and press out juice as 
usual for cider making. Be sure the 
juice does not ferment or " work " as 
only sweet cider should be used for 
sirup making. The sterilizing, reduc- 
ing vat, or kettle, should be a third 
larger than required to hold contents. 
Add 5 ounces of powdered calcium 
carbonate to 14 gallons of apple cider. 
Powdered calcium carbonate (carbon- 
ate of lime) or, to give it its common 
name, precipitated chalk, is a low- 
priced, harmless chemical available 
at any drug store. Boil in kettle or 
vat vigorously for a period of five 
minutes. Pour the liquid into ves- 
sels, preferably glass jars or pitchers, 
and allow it to stand six to eight 
hours, or until perfectly clear. Pour 
the clear liquid into preserving kettle. 
Do not allow sediment at bottom to 
enter. Add to the clear liquid' one 
level teaspoonful of lime carbonate 
and stir thoroughly. The process is 
completed by boiling down rapidly to 
a clear liquid. Use density gauge or 
candy thcnnoincter and bring it up to 
220°' ¥., or vvitliout tliermometer, re- 



duce bulk to one-seventh of original 
volume. 

To see whether it is cooked enough, 
test as you would sirup or candy, by 
pouring a little of it into cold water. 
If boiled enough, pour it into fruit 
jars, pitchers, etc., and allow it to 
cool slowly. Slow cooling is impor- 
tant, as otherwise the suspended 
matter will not settle properly and 
the sirup will be cloudy. A good way 
to insure slow cooling is to stand the 
vessels full of sirup in a bucket or a 
wash boiler of hot water. They may 
also be placed in a fireless cooker. 
The white sediment which settles out 
during cooling is called " malate of 
lime " and is a harmless compound of 
lime with the natural acid of the ap- 
ple. When the sirup is cooled, it 
should be stored in fruit jars or bot- 
tles. Place the rubber cap or cork 
in position and tighten. Then place 
the bottles or cans of sirup in hot 
water and sterilize for 12 minutes in 
a hot-water or wash-boiler outfit. 

Apple sirup made by this method 
is a very palatable and high-grade 
product. It has a flavor much like 
the thick sirup or jelly which is so 
often formed when apples are baked 
with a little sugar. This apple sirup 
can be used in cooking with good re- 
sults, as well as for table purposes. 

FRUIT PRESERVING 

While the modern method of can- 
ning fruits with small quantities of 
sugar or none at all is to be pre- 
ferred in most cases, there are a few 
fruits which make preserves of such 
excellent quality that their use may 
be recommended for special pur- 
poses. These are strawberries, sour 
cherries, sour plums and quinces. 
They should be put up preferably in 
tumblers or small jars. 

For strawberries use equal weights 
of sugar and fruit. Put a layer of 
berries in the bottom of the pre- 
serving kettle and sprinkle over it 
a layer of sugar. So continue until 
the fruit and sugar are about four 
inches deep. Bring slowly to a boil, 
skim carefully and boil ten minutes 
from the time it begins to bubble. 



PRESERVING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 



475 



Now pour upon platters to a depth 
of about two or three inches and 
place these in a sunny window in an 
unused room for three or four days, 
when the preserve will thicken to a 
jelly-like consistency. Put the cold 
preserve into jars or tumblers and 
seal. The large proportion of sugar 
present in this and other preserves 
is unfavorable to the growth of bac- 
teria and thus prevents them from 
spoiling. 

For white currants select large 
firm fruit, remove the stems and 
proceed as for strawberries. 

For cherries select the sour vari- 
eties such as Early Richmonds and 
Montmorency. Remove stems and 
stones and proceed as for strawber- 
ries. Or cherries may be preserved 
with currant juice. Use for this pur- 
pose 2 quarts of sugar to 3 quarts of 
currants by heating in a preserving 
kettle, crushing them as they boil up 
and straining through cheese cloth. 
Stem and stone the cherries taking 
care to save all the juice. Add the 
cherries to the fruit juice, stir in 
the sugar over the fire, bring to a 
boil slowly and carefully skim. Boil 
twenty minutes. Put in sterilized jars 
or tumblers and seal. This gives an 
acid preserve. The quantity of sugar 
may be doubled if desired. 

For plum preserve use 2 quarts 
of sugar to 1 pint of water and 4 
quarts of greengage or other plums. 
If the skins are left on, prick the 
fruit and cover with plenty of cold 
water. Bring slowly to a boil and 
let boil gently for five minutes. 
Drain well. Now stir the sugar into 
the water over the fire until dissolved 
and boil five minutes, skimming well. 
Add the drained fruit and cook gently 
twenty minutes. Put in sterilized 
jars. Remove the skins from the 
white varieties. 

For quince preserve use 2 quarts 
of sugar to 1 quart of water and 4 
quarts of fruit. Pare, quarter and 
core the quinces. Boil in clear water 
until tender, skim and drain. Now 
stir the sugar into the water until dis- 
solved, bring slowly to a boil, skim 
well and boil for' twenty minutes. 
Pour one-half the sirup into another 
kettle. Put one-half tlie cooked and 



drained fruit into each kettle, sim- 
mer gently half an hour and put in 
sterilized jars. Preserve the water in 
which the fruit is boiled and add to 
it the parings, cores and gnarly fruit 
to make jelly. 

Purees and Marmalade. — These 
preserves are merely crushed fruit 
pulp cooked with sugar. Purees dif- 
fer from marmalades in being 
cooked with a small quantity of wa- 
ter and not cooked so long. They 
retain more of the natural fruit flavor. 
This process is especially useful for 
preserving small seedy fruits for 
frozen desserts, cake and puddings. 
Pick over and remove leaves, stems 
and decayed portions, or peach, plum 
and cherry pits. Rub through a 
puree sieve and add to each quart 
of strained fruit a pint of sugar. 
Pack in sterilized jars, put the cov- 
ers on loosely and place on the rack 
in the boiler. Put enough cold water 
in the boiler to come half way up the 
sides of the jars. Bring slowly to a 
boil and boil thirty minutes from the 
time the water begins to bubble. Re- 
move the jars from the boiler one by 
one, place in a pan of hot water, fill 
with hot sirup and seal. 

For marmalade pick over berries 
with great care and rub through a 
fine sieve to remove the seeds. Re- 
move all cherry, plum or peach pits. 
Wash, pare, core and quarter large 
fruit. Allow 1 pint of sugar to each 
quart of fruit. Rinse the preserving 
kettle with cold water leaving a slight 
coat of moisture on the sides and 
bottom. Put in a layer of fruit, 
sprinkle with a layer of sugar and 
so continue until "all the fruit and 
sugar are used. Heat slowly and stir 
very frequently so as to break up the 
fruit as much as possible. Cook for 
about two hours and put in small 
sterilized jars. 

Cranberry Conserve. 
2 pints cranberries, 
i pound English walnut-meats, 
1 large orange, 
IJ cupfuls water, 
1 cupful Sultana raisins, 
1 \ pounds sugar. 

Pick over and wash the cranber- 
ries, put them into a lined saucepan

with half of the water and boil until 
the skins breali. Rub through a 
strainer, and add the remaining water, 
sugar, raisins, and grated rind and 
pulp of the orange. Bring slowly to 
the boiling-point and allow to cook 
slowly for twenty-five minutes, then 
add the nut-meats broken in small 
pieces and cook for five minutes 
longer. Divide into jars and seal. — 
Marion Harris Neil. 

Plum Conserve. — Cook 5 pounds 
plums until tender, covering with 3 
pints water. Strain through a col- 
ander and measure. Add 3 pound 
broken English walnuts, juice and 
pulp of 3 oranges, 2 pounds seeded 
raisins cut fine. Add I pound sugar 
to each pound of fruit. Cooli until 
like marmalade. — Anna Kinsley. 

Currant Conserve. 
Place in a preserving kettle 

1 pint currant juice, 

2 pounds currants, 

3 pounds raisins, 

4 pounds sugar, 

Grated peel and juice of 4 or- 
anges. 

Stir and boil until thick, and seal. — 
Anna Kinsley. 

Rhubarb and Fig Conserve. — Cut 
rhubarb in small pieces. Have 3 
pounds. Cut i pound figs in small 
pieces, i pound candied orange peel, 
grated rind and juice of 1 large 
lemon. Put in kettle with layers of 
sugar and let stand over night. Boil 
down xmtil thick — about 1 hour — 
pour in glasses and cover. — Anna 
Kinsley. 

Quince Preserves. 

Choose fine fruit: it will prove the 
most economical in the end, even 
though higher in price. Wash, dry 
and pare carefully, cut into quarters 
and remove the cores. Place the fruit 
in the preserving kettle with just 
enough water to create steam, and 
arrange the parings over the top. 
Cover the kettle, let heat slowly and 
stew very gently until tender. Care- 
fully remove all the parings from the 



surface, take the fruit out with a 
skimmer, drain as thoroughly as pos- 
sible, and spread out on large dishes. 
Strain the liquor through a cheese 
cloth bag, and then return it to the 
kettle, adding granulated sugar, 
measure for measure. Stir until the 
sugar is dissolved, and then let the 
siru]) boil for 10 minutes, sldmming 
repeatedly. Place the quinces in the 
boiling sirup and simmer gently until 
they become clear and take a rich 
color — usually about 20 minutes. 
Lift the fruit out with a perforated 
spoon and pack in jars. Fill to the 
brim with boiling hot sirup and seal 
air tight. — Mrs. Fred S. Long. 

Quince Honey. 

4 pounds of white sugar, 
2 pints of water, 

2 quinces. 

Put sugar and water on the stove 
and let boil. Grate the quinces and 
stir them in, let cook until it is as 
thick as j'ou wish it to be when cool. 
You can use more quince to the same 
amount of sugar and water if you so 
desire, or grate a few apples and add 
to the quinces. — Mrs. Fred S. Long. 

Preserved Pears. 

5 pounds chopped pears, 
5 pounds sugar, 

2 large or 3 small lemons. 
Dry ginger root. 

After the pears have been cored — 
not peeled — and all rotten parts cut 
away, chop enough to give five 
pounds. The quickest method for do- 
ing this is by means of a food chop- 
per. Put on stove with the chopped 
pulp of the lemons, and tie up in a 
bag about as much ginger root as can 
be bought for five cents. You can 
then remove this bag whenever the 
pears have enough of this flavor. 
Cook slowly lA hours, or until thick. — 
Mrs. K. A. Krothe. 

Raspberry Bar le Due. 

1 quart perfect red raspberries, 
1 cup currant juice, 

3 cups sugar, 

1 cup red raspberry juice. 



PRESERVING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES

Combine fruit juices, add sugar, 
boil until they are very thick, and 
almost jelly. Then drop in raspber- 
ries, a few at a time. Cook 3 or 3 
minutes, remove with skimmer to 
small glasses. When berries are all 
cooked, the sirup is thinned, boil down 
very thick. Pour into the glasses con- 
taining the berries, and seal. — Anna 
Kinsley. 

Strawberry and Pineapple Pre- 
serves. — Take 3 large pineapples, 
peel and cut up, weigh them, cover 
with water, and cook imtil tender. 
Take 8 quarts strawberries, wash, 
stem, and weigh them. For each 
pound of fruit use J pound sugar. 
LA.dd sugar to water pineapple was 
boiled in. Boil up and add pineap- 
ple; when nearly soft add strawber- 
ries. Let boil slowly, being careful 
to keep from burning. Cook until 
pineapple is tender. Seal when 
thick. — Anna Kinsley. 

Ginger Pears. — Eight pounds pears, 
four pounds sugar, juice and grated 
rind of four lemons, one-fourth j^ound 
ginger root, one cup water. Boil 
forty-five minutes. — Mrs. M. L. Judd. 

Kumquat Marmalade. — Take 3 
pounds of kumquats, wash and slice 
thin. "Weigh again and add an equal 
weight of water. Let stand 24 hours, 
then boil 30 minutes and set to cool 
again. Next day boil 30 minutes. 
Again weigh and add equal weight 
of sugar and boil 20 minutes. Fill 
glasses and cover when cold. — Glenn 
Martin. • 

May-Haw Jelly, 
§ cupful sugar, 
1 cupful juice. 

Losing this proportion, proceed as 
in making apple jelly. — Glenn Mar- 
tin. 

Pineapple and Apricot Jam. 

Cook together, stirring frequently 
for about 40 minutes, 4 cups cooked 
apricots — either fresh or dried — and 
1 pineapple — cut in small pieces — 
(or 1 can of pineapple) and 4 cups 
of sugar. Place in tumblers, and 
cover as for jelly. — Mrs. W. M. Par- 
rett. 



Spanish Jam. 

To the juice of 5 quarts of currants 
add 2 cups of water, and bring to a 
boil, skimming repeatedly. Stir in 
the grated rind of 6 oranges and boil 
for 20 minutes. Then add the juice 
of the oranges, stir in 5 pounds of 
sugar and 1^ pounds raisins, and boil 
for f hour, or until it is of the de- 
sired consistency. 

English Orange Marmalade. 

Use preferably a combination of 
Seville and California or other sweet 
oranges, in the proportion of 1 dozen 
Seville to i dozen sweet oranges. 
Shred the fruit as fine as possible, re- 
move the pits, and add 2J pints of 
Avater to each pint of shredded fruit. 
Place in a preserving kettle, cover, 
and let stand over night. Bring to a 
boil and let boil for 1 hour. Again 
cover and let stand over night. Then 
add IJ pounds of sugar to each pound 
of the fruit, and boil about i hour, or 
until the mixture jellies. Cover the 
pits of the Seville oranges with warm 
water, let steep 24 hours, strain, and 
add the flavored water to the mixture 
just before the last boiling. 

Preserved Figs. — Gather the figs 
when not quite ripe. Peel and weigh 
them. Take f pound granulated 
sugar and ^ teaspoonful of ground 
ginger to each pound figs. Boil the 
sugar to a sirup in as little water as 
possible. Then add the figs and thin 
slices of lemon (half lemon to each 
pound). As soon as the fruit be- 
comes transparent, lay it in a steril- 
ized glass jar. If the sirup is thin let 
it boil 10 minutes longer before pour- 
ing over the fruit. Seal tightly. — 
Kate Matson Post.

1 egg white, 

1 tablespoonful chopped pre- 
served ginger, 
i cupful orange-juice. 
Powdered sugar. 
Chopped nut-meats. 
Sugar, 
Red coloring.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Select large, light figs, trim off the 
stem end, pick over carefully and with 
a sharp knife open one side. Fill 
with a mixture made as follows: 
Mix the white of the egg with the 
orange-juice, preserved ginger, and 
sufficient powdered sugar to make a 
stiff dough; then mix in with it one- 
half as much chopped nut-meats. 
When the figs are filled with this 
mixture, press together, roll in pink 
sugar and pack in flower-pots lined 
with wax-paper. . Decorate the top 
with small Cnristmas trees. To make 
the pink sugar, put some fine or gran- 
ulated sugar on a piece of stiff white 
paper, sprinkle over it a few drops 
of red coloring, and rub with a 
wooden spoon till evenly distributed. 
Dry in a moderate heat, occasionally 
separating the grains by rubbing them 
between the fingers. — Marion Harris 
Neil. 

Fig Preserves. 

For 1 quart figs use g quart sugar 
and 1 sliced pineapple, or lemon. 
After thoroughly washing the figs, run 
a fork through each. The figs should 
be handled with care, holding them 
by the stems, so they will not become 
shapeless. Place the sugar in a 
granite saucepan and moisten it with 
water. Boil the sirup until clear, 
then drop in the figs. Boil one hour, 
then add sliced lemon or pineapple 
and boil one hour more. — Glenn Mar- 
tin. 

Spiced Peaches. 

Look over the peaches carefully, 
selecting ripe fruit and discarding all 
that are soft or speckled. Rub clean 
with a soft dry cloth and stick in 
each large peach four or five cloves 
and in each small one, two or three 
cloves. Place in a preserving kettle 1 
quart sugar, 1 pint vinegar and a 
small quantity of cinnamon bark and 
bring to a boil. Then place in this 
sirup 8 or 10 peaches, allowing them 
to cook until soft enough to pierce 
easily with a fork. Pack the peaches 
in a quart jar, cover with sirup and 
seal. — Mrs. Grover C. Stemple. 

Fruit Preserved in Grape Juice. — 
Any kind of fruit can be preserved 



by this method without the use of 
sugar, but it is particularly recom- 
mended for api)les, pears and sweet 
plums. Boil 6 quarts of grape juice 
in an open ])reserving kettle down 
to 4 quarts. Have the fruit washed 
and pared and large fruit quartered 
and cored. Cover the prepared fruit 
with boiled grape juice, boil gently 
until tender and put in sterilized jars. 

Boiled Cider. — Choose cider that 
is perfectly fresh and sweet. Fill 
an ojicn preserving kettle not over 
two-thirds full and Iwil down one- 
half, skimming frequently. Put in 
bottles or stone jugs and use to im- 
prove mince meat or make cider ajj- 
ple sauce. 

Cider Apple or Pear Sauce. — Use 
5 quarts of boiled cider to 8 quarts 
of pared, quartered and cored fruit. 
Cover the prepared fruit with boiled 
cider and cook for two or three 
hours, or until clear and tender. 
Place the kettle on an iron tripod or 
ring to prevent burning. But if 
necessary to stir the sauce take care 
to break the fruit as little as possible. 

Fruit Butter. 

An appetizing and very economical 
kind of preserve, much favored in 
many localities, is fruit butter, i.e., 
apple, peach, pear, or other fruit pulp 
boiled down in water or cider to a 
smooth paste. A special advantage 
of this process is that it admits of us- 
ing inferior grades of fruit, but the 
fruit should be carefully looked over 
and all rotten spots or other defects 
cut out. The usual method of mak- 
ing fruit butter is by boiling down 
the fruit pulp in an open kettle on 
the top of the stove, as for making 
jam or marmalade, but the process 
maj'^ be shortened and considerable 
labor saved by baking the pulp during 
the latter part of the process in the 
oven with a slow and steady fire. 
Boiling down fruit juice on the top of 
the stove is a tedious and laborious 
process, because constant stirring is 
required to prevent the fruit pulp 
from burning on. A number of the 
large glass balls that boys call agates, 
placed in the bottom of the kettle, 
will save considerable labor, as the 



PRESERVING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 



479 



movement of the boiling mass will 
keep them moving and will tend to 
prevent the pulp from sticking and 
burning on. 

To prepare apple, peach, pear, or 
other fruit butter, wash the fruit 
without jieeling or coring it, but care- 
fully cut out wormy or rotten spots 
and other defects. Place the fruit in 
the preserving kettle with just enough 
water to cover it, except in the case 
of cider apple butter, in which sub- 
stitute cider for water. Boil the fruit 
slowly until it falls to pieces, then 
pass the juice and pulp through a 
granite colander to remove skins, 
cores, and seeds, and allow to simmer 
until of the thickness of rich cream. 
At this stage, add spices and sugar 
if desired and continue boiling with 
constant stirring until the pulji is per- 
fectly smooth and of the desired con- 
sistency. 

Or place the pulp in an earthenware 
crock or granite pan or kettle, cover 
with a heavy lid, and bake in a slow 
steady oven until it looks glossy and 
thickens like jelly, when it will be 
done. By the baking process the ne- 
cessity of constant stirring is avoided, 
as it will be sufficient to stir the mass 
at intervals of about half an hour. 

Remove while hot to jelly tumblers, 
ordinary glass jars, or earthenware 
crocks, and cover with paraffin to 
exclude the air, or seal. 

For the different kinds of fruit the 
following special suggestions may be 
observed: 

Apple or Peach Butter. — Drain off 
the juice in which the fruit is 
cooked through a cloth, and use for 
jelly. Mix the pulp with about one- 
third its own bulk of sugar and boil 
down or bake, as desired. 

Cider Apple Butter. — Select ap- 
ples that cook easily, wash, peel, quar- 
ter, and core them, boil down the 
cider to one-half, cover the fruit with 
an equal amount of the boiled down 
cider; and boil rapidly on the top of 
the stove as, if the boiling is slow, 
the fruit is likely to sink to the bot- 
tom and scorch. After the butter 
commences to thicken, usually in the 
course of about two hours, it will be 
necessary to stir constantly and vig- 



orously, to prevent burning. If the 
butter thickens or jellies before it 
becomes perfectly smooth, stir in a 
little more cider. Sweeten with gran- 
ulated sugar and spice to taste, but 
avoid using too much spice, as it tends 
to cover the natural flavor of the 
product. 

Crabapple Butter. — Fruit butter 
from crabapples is not quite equal to 
cider apple butter, but is more eco- 
nomical, as crabapples are usually 
cheap and abundant. Follow the 
above process, adding sugar and 
spices to taste at the stage when the 
pulp begins to thicken. 

Pear Butter. — Boil the fruit in a 
very little water until it falls to 
pieces, put through a colander to re- 
move cores and seeds, add half as 
much sugar by bulk as there is pulp, 
and spice to taste. Cook slowly, stir- 
ring constantly to prevent burning. 

JELLY MAKING 

All fruit when ripe or nearly so 
contains a substance called pectin 
which has properties somewhat simi- 
lar to starch. All housekeepers know 
that starch when boiled in water cools 
in a jelly-like mass. A similar prop- 
erty in pectin causes fruit juices, 
when properly boiled, to jell. But 
if fruits become overripe, or if fruit 
juices ferment or are cooked too 
long, the pectin undergoes a change 
and loses this power. Experience has 
shown that a definite amount of sugar 
dissolved in the fruit juice — namely, 
25 degrees as registered by the sirup 
gauge — is exactly right for combin- 
ing with pectin to make jelly. Any 
excess of sugar tends to form crj'stals 
and the presence of these tends to 
cause the whole mass to crystallize. 
Moreover, if the sirup boils so rapidly 
that some of it rises on the sides 
of the preserving kettle, such particles 
will form crystals and these, if stirred 
into the sirup, may crystallize the 
whole. Hence the three chief secrets 
of jelly making are: (1) The selec- 
tion of fruit which is just ripe, or 
slightly underripe; (2) the use of the 
sirup gauge; and (3) slow and care- 
ful boiling with especial care not to 
boil too long. The sirup gauge should 



4i80 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



register 25 degrees for every kind of 
fruit without exception. 

Housewives are often perplexed be- 
cause one lot of jelly crystallizes or 
refuses to harden, whereas another 
prepared by the same recipe and 
treated under apparently similar con- 
ditions is entirely satisfactory. The 
diflference may be due to either of 
several causes. One lot of fruit may 
be overripe or may contain a greater 
or less proportion of fruit sugar 
than another. Or the difference may 
be caused by too rapid or prolonged 
boiling. Fruit picked during a cold, 
wet season or immediately after a 
rain will contain a good deal more 
w^ater and consequently a less pro- 
portion of sugar than if picked after 
a prolonged period of heat and sun- 
shine. Hence if the proportion of 
sugar is determined solely by meas- 
urement, somewhat less than a pint 
of sugar will be required for a pint 
of juice during wet seasons and vice 
versa. For the same reason small 
fruits should be washed quickly and 
thoroughly drained to prevent their 
absorbing much water. But the use 
of the sirup gauge will obviate all 
such difficulties. It measures the ex- 
act amount of sugar present, includ- 
ing both the natural fruit sugar and 
cane sugar added in the process of 
preserving. 

Hence, in general, select for jelly 
making juicy fruit picked during a 
period of sujishine, or at least pre- 
ferably not immediately after rain. 
Wash quickly, drain, express the 
juice, add to the clear juice about 
1 pint more or less of granulated 
sugar to the ]>int of juice, boil, skim 
and pour into tumblers or small 
jars. 

Acid fruits make the best jelly and 
the following are to be preferred 
in the order given: Currant, crab-ap- 
ple, apple, quince, grape, blackberry, 
raspberry, peach. Wild raspberries, 
blackberries, barberries, grapes and 
beech-plums all make delicious jellies. 
Take care to choose barberries that 
are fresh and not overripe. Sweet 
fruits, such as apples, make a very 
mild jelly, but may be flavored with 
fruits, flowers or spices, but with the 
sour varieties this will not be neces- 



sary. Some fruits, such as the straw- 
berry, contain very little pectin and 
are difficult to jell without the addi- 
tion of some other fruit juice, such as 
the currant, when a i)leasant jelly 
will result. 

Apple Pectin from Pomace. — To 
25 j)ounds of apple pomace add 1 
ounce of tartaric or citric acid and 
100 pounds of water. Boil slowly for 
GO minutes, and press the liquid from 
the pomace in a cider press. Filter 
the liquid through a canton-flannel 
bag. The pectin of the pomace will 
be in this extract. When it is desired 
to make a good quality of jelly from 
fruit juices that do not jell readily, 
add this pectin after sugar has been 
dissolved in the juice. 

Currant Jelly. — To make good 
jelly from currants, raspberries, 
blackberries, ripe grapes and plums, 
proceed as follows: Pick over the 
fruit and remove all leaves, large 
stems and the like. Wash quickly, 
drain, and put fruit over the fire in 
a preserving kettle. Crush with a 
wooden vegetable masher or spoon 
enough to start the juice, heat slowly 
and stir frequently. When hot crush 
thoroughly with the vegetable masher. 
Express the juice into a large bowl 
through two thicknesses of cheese 
cloth spread over a hair or wire sieve. 
Let the juice drip without pressure, 
merely moving the pulp about by 
lifting the corners of the cheese cloth 
and slightly shakuig the contents until 
all the free juice has been obtained. 
Use this to make the best quality of 
jelly either as it is or after first 
passing it through a flannel or woolen- 
cloth or jelly bag. This will make 
a somewhat more transparent jell. 
Now remove the sieve to another bowl, 
twist the corners of the cheese cloth 
and squeeze out as much more juice 
as can be obtained. Use this to make 
jelly of a lower grade. 

Measure the juice into a clean pre- 
serving kettle and stir in a pint of 
granulated sugar for every pint of 
juice until the sugar is dissolved. 
Place over the fire and bring to a 
boil slowly. Observe carefully the 
moment it begins to boll, withdraw 
from the fire and skim. Again bring 
to a boil, remove and skim a second 



PRESERVING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES

and third time. Then pour into hot 
sterilized glasses and place these on 
a hot sunny window-sill covered pref- 
erably with panes of glass. When 
cool and firm seal and store in a 
dark, cool place. 

Or jelly may be prepared directly 
from the strained juice without boil- 
ing by dissolving the required 
amount of sugar in the cold juice, 
pouring it into warm sterilized 
glasses and otherwise treating as be- 
fore. Such jelly is more delicate but 
does not keep quite so well. 

Other good jellies may be made by 
the same process from a mixture of 
equal parts of currants and rasp- 
berries, or a mixture of 10 quarts of 
strawberries with 2 quarts of cur- 
rants, but the last mentioned must be 
boiled fifteen minutes. 

For ripe grape jelly choose an 
acid grape, as the sweet varieties 
contain too much sugar, or use half 
ripe fruit or equal portions of nearly 
ripe and green grapes. Wild grapes 
are excellent. 

For plum jelly use an underripe 
acid plum. Wash, stem and cook 
gently in 1 quart of water for each 
peck of fruit. Strain the juice and 
proceed as for currant jelly. 

Apple and Crab-apple Jelly. — 
Large fruits such as apples, peaches 
and pears must be boiled in water 
to extract the pectin and flavoring 
matter they contain. As a rule 4 
quarts of water added to 8 quarts 
of fruit will produce 3 quarts of 
strained juice, but juicy peaches and 
plums may require only 3 or 3i 
quarts of water. Boil down the 
juice if necessary to 3 quarts. Stem 
and wash the fruit. Wipe dry and 
clean carefully the blossom end, and 
cut in quarters. Add 4 quarts of 
water to 8 of fruit and cook gently 
until soft and clear. Strain the juice, 
boil down to 3 quarts if necessary 
and proceed as for currant jelly. 
The quality of the jelly will depend 
upon the natural flavor of the fruit. 
Hence choose preferably a fine flav- 
ored acid apple and make the jelly 
at any time of the year when the 
fruit chosen is at its prime. Apple 
jelly made in the spring may be im- 
proved by the addition of the juice 



of a lemon to every pint of apple 
juice. 

To make cider apple jelly, use 
cider fresh from the press instead of 
water. 

Quince Jelly. — Rub the quinces 
with a coarse crash towel. Cut out 
the blossom end, rinse and drain. 
Wash and pare the fruit, quarter and 
cut out the cores, and keep them by 
themselves. Drop the best pieces of 
fruit into a bowl half full of water 
containing lemon juice, to be pre- 
served or canned. Run the parings 
and imperfect parts through a meat 
chopper or chop finely. Add a quart 
of water to every 2 quarts of chopped 
fruits and parings and cook gently 
for two hours. Strain and proceed 
as for apple jelly. Put the cores 
into another kettle, cover with plenty 
of water and cook two hours. 

Now, to make a second grade of 
jelly, add the chopped parings and 
fruit from which the juice has been 
extracted, mix and strain. Return 
the clear juice to the preserving 
kettle, stir in a pint of sugar for 
each pint of juice and boil ten min- 
utes. 

Covering Jelly. — Cut out some 
discs of any thick white paper, pre- 
ferably paraffin or butter paper, the 
size of the top of the jelly glass. 
A simple way to make a pattern of 
the exact size is by means of a small 
compass or pair of dividers. When 
the jelly is hard and firm, brush 
over the top with brandy or alcohol 
to kill any spores of mold that may 
be present. Dip a disc of paper in 
the spirits and let it rest on the 
jelly. Now put on the covers. 

Or tie a disc of cotton batting over 
the top of the glass. 

Or cut discs of paper about half 
an inch in diameter larger than the 
top of the glass, wet them in a mix- 
ture of the white of an epg beaten 
together with a tablespoon ful of 
cold water and press down the sides 
until they stick. 

Or cut covers about an Inch in 
diameter larger than the top of the 
glass, dip in olive oil and tie on the

Or pour melted paraffin in the top 
of the glass over a piece of paper

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 






dipped in brandy or alcohol. Set 
the paraffin in a cup surrounded by 
warm water and heat gently until 
melted. Make a layer at least one- 
fourth of an inch thick. 

Fruit Juices. — These may be 
canned or bottled with or without 
sugar as desired. Use preferably 
self-sealing bottles such as pop or 
beer bottles with care to sterilize both 
bottles and corks. 

For grape juice wash the grapes, 
pick them over and remove the stems 
and all defective specimens. To ex- 
press the juice crush slightly in the 
preserving kettle, heat# slowly and 
boil gently for half an hour. Crush 
the fruit and express the juice as 
for jelly making, except that all the 
juice may be preserved together. 
Bring the strained juice to a boil in 
a clean preserving kettle, remove and 
skim. Do this a second time. Then 
stir in the sugar until dissolved, boil 
five minutes, skim and put into hot 
sterilized bottles or jars. Set these 
in pans of boiling water in a moder- 
ate oven for ten minutes. Now fill 
up with boiling juice, seal and place 
on boards to cool protected from 
drafts. For grapes use about 1 gill 
of sugar to a quart of juice. 

For raspberries, blackberries and 
strawberries, use A pint of sugar to 
each quart of juice and for currants 
a full pint, otherwise proceed as for 
grape juice. 

For cherry, plum and peach juices 
add i pint of sugar to each quart 
of juice. 

Fruit Sirups. — Proceed in all re- 
spects as for fruit juices, but use at 
least one-half as much sugar as fruit 
juice. Use fruit sirups to flavor ice 
creams and water ices, also for bev- 
erages at the rate of two or three 
spoonfuls to the glass of ice water. 

Preserving Powders. — Avoid all so- 
called " preserving powders " whether 
advertised under various trade names 
or put up and sold by druggists or 
peddlers. Any antiseptics that will 
prevent the decay of fruits and vege- 
tables are injurious to health regard- 
less of all claims by interested per- 
sons to the contrary. Nothing of the 
sort is necessary if sound ripe fruit 
is selected and sterilized by means 



of heat in the proper manner. And 
since the necessary care to do good 
work adds little or nothing to the 
cost of preserving fruits and vege- 
tables, the so-called " preserving pow- 
ders " serve no useful jjurpose. On 
the contrary they tend to encourage 
unclean and slovenly work and to con- 
ceal the effects of using decaying 
fruits and vegetables. 

CANNING VEGETABLES 

Some vegetables are more difficult 
to preserve properly than fruits and 
fruit juices, since they contain a con- 
siderable proi)ortion of the element 
nitrogen, the presence of wliich 
makes any substance a good culture 
medium for the bacteria, spores and 
molds which cause decomposition. 
Moreover, the addition of sugar to 
fruits and fruit juices helps to pro- 
duce a condition which is unfavor- 
able to the growth of these injurious 
organisms. I3ut the addition of sugar 
to most vegetables would not be de- 
sirable. Hence, a considerably longer 
and more heroic treatment for can- 
ning vegetables is required. The 
process, however, is simple and is so 
similar to the ordinary methods of 
canning fruit that it can be readily 
carried out by any housekeejjer if the 
following suggestions are observed: 

The secret of canning vegetables 
lies in the fact that whereas bacteria 
may be readily killed at the tempera- 
ture of boiling water, the spores or 
seeds of certain kinds may retain 
their vitality unless they are kept at 
the temperature of boiling water for 
a long time — about five hours — or 
preferably boiled for about one hour 
upon two or three successive days. 
The latter is the method 'employed 
by scientific men and is the one here 
recommended. The first day's boil- 
ing kills all the molds and most of 
the bacteria but does not kill their 
spores or seeds. These start to grow 
as soon as the contents of the jar 
is cool. The second boiling kills the 
crop of bacteria thus formed before 
they have time to develop spores. 
The third boiling is not always neces- 
sarj^ but is advised to make assur- 
ance doubly sure. This process is 



PRESERVING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 



483 



called by scientists " fractional ster- 
ilization." It is the whole secret of 
canning meat, fruits or vegetables 
and any one who will bear it in mind 
may be sure of satisfactory results. 

Observe, however, that the air must 
be excluded at all times after the 
first boiling. Otherwise a new crop 
of bacteria, spores and molds will be 
deposited from the air and the work 
of sterilization will be undone. Cook- 
ing for three short periods in a 
closed container at a comparatively 
low temperature instead of cooking 
for one short period at a high tem- 
perature, or for one long period in 
an open vessel makes the vital dif- 
ference and insures a freshness of 
flavor and color such that the differ- 
ence between the product and the 
fresh vegetables can hardly be de- 
tected. After the jars have been 
sterilized and tested keep them in 
the dark, or wrap them closely in 
dark colored paper, as sunlight will 
soon destroy the color. 

Canning' Corn. — All housewives 
will be glad to know that corn is 
one of the easiest vegetables to can 
if proper precautions are observed. 
Select preferably the sweetest and 
most delicate varieties. Experiment 
has proved that the amount of sugar 
in sweet corn diminishes very rapidly 
after the ear is pulled from the 
stalk. Hence endeavor to get the 
kernels into the can within an hour 
after the corn is picked. If this can 
be done the result will be far su- 
perior to the ordinary commercial 
product. Select ears with full grains, 
just before they begin to harden, 
since the corn is then sweetest. Husk 
the ears and remove the silks with 
a stiff brush. Shear off the grain 
with a shar]) knife, pack the jar full 
and salt to taste, usually at the rate 
of one teaspoonful to the quart. 
Fill up the jar to the top with clear 
cold water, put on the rubber ring 
and place the glass top on loosely 
but without depressing the spring. 
Now place the jars upon a false bot- 
tom in a wash boiler and separate 
them by means of rags or cotton 
rope, such as an old clothesline, so 
that they cannot strike one another 
when the water begins to boil. Pour 



in about three inches of cold water 
or enough to fill the boiler with 
steam. More than enough to prevent 
the boiler from going dry is not 
necessary as the steam will do the 
cooking. Cover the boiler tightly, 
bring to a boil and let boil for a 
full hour. Now remove the cover and 
allow the steam to escape. Press 
down the spring to prevent air from 
entering. Remove the jars to cool, 
or let them stand in the boiler until 
the next day. 

On the second day raise the spring 
as before and again boil for one 
hour. Once more clamp down the 
top and let stand until the follow- 
ing day. Then repeat the operation. 
Observe that the jars when hot must 
be carefully shielded from drafts of 
cold air or the sudden change of tem- 
perature will crack them. 

After the third boiling clamp on 
the top and let stand two or three 
days. Then test each jar by releas- 
ing the spring and picking up the 
jar by the glass top. If the top 
does not come off the contents are 
reasonably sure to keep unless there 
should chance to be one or more 
anaerobic bacteria present which may 
cause trouble later on. Should this 
happen increase the length of boil- 
ing for the next lot to H hours. 

If the tops come off when the can 
is tested, decomposition has begun 
to take place and gases have been 
formed which offset the atmospheric 
pressure on the outside of the jar. 
In this case it is best to reject the 
contents and to cleanse and refill the 
jar. 

The above directions apply only to 
pint and quart jars. Increase the 
time of boiling for half gallon jars 
to one and a half hours. A little 
practice may be required at first to 
secure perfect results by this meth- 
od; hence do not try too many jars 
the first time. JNIake a few experi- 
ments in the early part of the sea- 
son until you fully understand the 
directions and learn to follow them 
properly. After that there will be no 
difficulty and the benefits of fresh 
vegetables from the kitchen garden 
will be extended to every season of 
the year.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



The same general process applies 
to canning otlier vegetables except 
for the mode of preparing them be- 
fore commencing the sterilizing proc- 
ess, as to which the following sugges- 
tions are offered: 

Stringbeans. — Pick these when 
young and tender, string, break into 
short lengths, i)ack firmly in the jar, 
cover with cold water and add a tea- 
spoonful of salt to each quart. 
Otherwise proceed as for corn. Add 
a small bit of red pepper in the bot- 
tom of each jar, if desired. 

Eggplant.-^ Pare, cut in thin 
slices and drop into boiling water 
for fifteen or twenty minutes. Drain 
and pack in jars. Proceed as for 
corn. Remove in slices when re- 
quired and fry in bread crumbs, or 
make into puddings and bake. 

Beets. — Pull while young and ten- 
der. Cut off the tops, wash and 
drop in boiling water for one and 
a half hours, or imtil thoroughly 
cooked. Skin, slice and pack in jars. 
Proceed as for corn. To pickle, 
cover with equal parts of water 
and good vinegar and sweeten to 
taste. 

Okra or Gumbo. — Pick the pods 
while young and tender, wash, cut 
in short lengths and sterilize as above. 
Use for soups and stews. 

Summer Squash. — Cut into small 
blocks, pack, cover with water, add 
salt and sterilize as above. Or skin, 
boil or steam until well cooked, mash, 
pack and sterilize. But in this case 
steam for an hour and a half each 
day as the heat penetrates the jar 
more slowly. Each jar wMU contain 
above twice as much of the cooked 
vegetable as if uncooked. 

English Peas. — Choose young 
sweet peas and proceed as for corn. 
This product has all the delicate 
flavor of the fresh vegetable. 

Asparagus. — Can the tips only, the 
same as for corn. 

Cauliflower. — Prepare in summer 
the same as for serving at table. 
Pack in jars and sterilize. 

Carrots and Parsnips. — Gather in 
early summer when the young plants 
are tender and sweet. Prepare as 
for serving at table and sterilize as 
for corn. 



Turnips and Kohl-Rabi. — Prepare 
as for the table, pack and sterilize. 

Lima Beans. — Pick before the 
pods begin to harden and treat as 
for corn. 

Pumpkin or Winter Squash. — Pre- 
serve these in their natural condition 
in a suitable storeroom as long as 
possible. But should they show signs 
of decay, steam and can the same as 
summer squash. By this time the 
jars which have been emptied of other 
vegetables will be available and may 
thus be made to do double service. 

Succotash. — Gather fresii corn 
and beans early in the morning. Pre- 
pare and sterilize as above. This is 
one of the most difficult things to 
can, hence boil an hour and a half 
each day as for summer squash. 

Vegetable Roast. — Prepare corn, 
Uma beans, tomatoes, stringbeans, 
okra, squash and eggplant as for 
canning separately. Mix in any de- 
sired proportions but let the com 
and lima beans predominate. Add 
two or three medium sized onions to 
each quart and run through a food 
chopper to mix thoroughly. Pack 
into jars and sterilize by boiling an 
hour and a half each day for three 
days as for summer squash. To pre- 
pare for the table mix an equal 
amount of bread crumbs, add a piece 
of butter the size of a walnut and 
one egg. Season to taste with pep- 
per and salt and bake in a round 
baking dish until brown. Cut into 
slices like a meat loaf and serve hot 
with drawn-butter sauce. 

Or corn, okra and tomatoes, mixed 
in equal proportions, may be canned 
as soup stock. 

Stewed Tomatoes. — These keep 
very easily even in the common screw- 
top jar. Hence such jars may be set 
aside for tomatoes and the more 
modern styles used for canning other 
vegetables. In ihis case observe that 
the tops and rubbers n\ust first be 
sterilized by placing them in cold 
water. Bring to a boil and boil for 
ten minutes. Handle as little as pos- 
sible, especially the inside of the top 
or inner edge of the rubber. Fill 
the jar with the cooked tomatoes 
while steaming hot, put on the rub- 
ber, screw the top down firmly, in-

vert it and let it stand in that posi- 
tion until cold. To prepare the to- 
matoes, wash and plunge them in 
boiling water for five minutes. Now 
dip for a moment in cold water, pare, 
slice and place them in a preserving 
kettle over an iron ring or tripod. 
Heat slowly and stir frequently from 
tlie bottom. Bring to a boil and then 
boil thirty minutes. Put in sterilized 
jars and seal. 

Whole Tomatoes. — Use 8 quarts of 
medium sized whole tomatoes and 4 
quarts of sliced tomatoes. Prepare 
the sliced tomatoes as for stewed 
tomatoes. Boil twenty minutes, rub 
through a strainer and return to the 
fire. Now pare the whole tomatoes 
and put them in sterilized jars. Pour 
over them the stewed and strained 
tomatoes until the jar is full. Put 
the uncovered jars in a moderate 
oven on a pad of asbestos, or in a 
shallow pan of hot water and cook 
for half an hour. Remove, fill to 
overflowing with boiling hot strained 
tomatoes and seal. Any strained to- 
matoes left over may be canned for 
sauces. 

Blanching and Cold-Dipping Veg- 
etables. — Advocates of the blanching 
and cold dipping process assert that 
the effects of the sudden and extreme 
change of temperature upon bacteria, 
spores, and molds is so effectual that 
this process when followed by a single 
period of sterilization is just as ef- 
fective as though three periods for 
three successive days were used, and 
that the product having been cooked 
less, appears more natural in color 
and texture, and has a better flavor. 
It is further argued, that, while the 
intermittent or fractional steriliza- 
tion method is very effectual, the lift- 
ing of jars in and out of the steril- 
izer three times consumes too much 
energj% that the process requires too 
much time, too much fuel, and usu- 
ally over-cooks the products, and 
hence that this method does not en- 
courage the saving, in large amounts, 
of such inexpensive and important 
vegetable foods as greens, sweetcorn, 
tomatoes, beets, etc. 

The fractional sterilization method 
is elsewhere recommended since it 



may, perhaps, be regarded as the 
safest for the ordinary housekeeper 
who desires to put up only a few 
jars of vegetables for family use, and 
can readily sterilize these upon the 
back of the stove for an hour on 
three successive days without loss of 
time or additional cost for fuel. But 
whoever desires to put up vegetables 
in large quantities would do well to 
experiment with the blanching and 
dipping process followed by the sin- 
gle period of sterilization, and for 
this process the following recipes are 
recommended : 

Vegetable Greens. 

Prepare and can the day picked. 
Sort and clean. Blanch in a vessel 
with a little water under false bot- 
tom or in a regular steamer, 15 to -20 
minutes. Remove. Plunge quickly 
into cold water. Cut in convenient 
lengths. Pack tight in jar or con- 
tainer, season to taste and add a lit- 
tle chipped beef, olive oil, etc. Add 
hot water to fill crevices, and a level 
teaspoonful of salt to each quart. If 
using glass jars, place rubber and 
top in position, and partially seal. 
Sterilize 90 minues in hot-water bath 
outfit. Remove from canner. Tighten 
covers. Invert to cool and test 
joints. Wrap in paper to prevent 
bleaching, and store. 

This recipe may be applied to any 
or all of the following cultivated veg- 
etables: Swiss chard, kale, Chinese 
cabbage leaves, upland cress, French 
endive, cabbage sprouts, turnip tops. 
New Zealand spinach, asparagus, 
spinach, beet tops, cultivated dande- 
lion, dasheen sprouts; and also to the 
following wild greens : native mustard, 
Russian mustard, collards, rape, pep- 
per cress, lamb's quarter, sour dock, 
smartweed sprouts, purslane or " pus- 
ley," pokeweed, dandelion, marsh 
marigold, wild mustard, and the ten- 
der sprouts and young leaves of 
milkweed. 

For Cabbage, Brussels Sprouts, 
and Cauliflower the recipe is practi- 
cally the same as for the above-named 
vegetable greens, and the same in- 
structions may be followed. Experi- 
ence alone will teach the slight varia- 



486 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



tions necessary in amount of time re- 
quired for blanching, amount of sea- 
soning necessary for the various veg- 
etable greens, etc. 

Root and Tuber Vegetables. — In 
canning carrots, parsnips, beets, tur- 
nips, sweet potatoes, etc., grade for 
size, color, and degree of ripeness. 
Wash thoroughly, using vegetable 
brush. Scald in boiling hot water 
sufficiently to loosen the skin, then 
plunge quickly into cold water. 
Scrape or pare to remove skin. Pack 
whole or cut in sections or cubes, as 
required by the home or market 
standard. Add boiling hot water and 
one level teaspoonful of salt to the 
quart. Place rubbers and tops in 
position. Partially seal, but not 
tight. Sterilize 90 minutes in hot 
water. 

Tomatoes. — Scald in hot water 
enough to loosen skins. Plunge 
quickly in cold water, remove, core, 
and skin. Pack whole. Fill con- 
tainer with whole tomatoes only. 
Add one level teaspoonful of salt to 
each quart. Place rubber in cap in 
position and partially seal, but not 
tight. Sterilize 20 minutes in hot 
water. 

Sweet Corn on the Cob. — Always 
can corn the same day picked. Re- 
move husks, silks, and grade for size. 
Blanch on the cob in boiling water 5 
to 15 minutes. Plunge quickly in cold 
water. Pack ears, alternating butts 
and tips, in half gallon jars or gal- 
lon tin cans. Pour over boiling hot 
water and add 2 level teaspoonfuls of 
salt to each gallon. Place rubbers 
and tops in position, seal partially, 
but not tight, and sterilize in hot 
water 180 minutes, one period. When 
sweet corn is taken from jar or tin 
can for table use, remove ears as soon 
as jar or can is opened. Heat corn, 
slightly buttered, in steamer. Do not 
allow ears to stand in water or to be 
boiled in water the second time. 

Sweet Corn Cut from the Cob. — 
Always can the same day as picked. 
Remove husks and silks, blanch on the 
cob in boiling hot water 5 to 15 min- 
utes. Plunge quickly in cold water. 
Cut the corn from the cob with a 
thin, sharp-bladed knife. Pack corn 



in jar tightly until full. Add one 
level teaspoonful of salt to each 
quart and sufficient hot water to fill. 
Place rubber and top in position, seal 
partially, and sterilize 180 minutes 
in hot water. 

Lima Beans, String Beans, Peas, 
Okra, Etc. — Always can same day 
vegetables are picked. Cull, string, 
and grade. Blanch in boiling hot 
water for 2 to 5 minutes. Remove 
and plunge quickly in cold water. 
Pack in container until full. Add 
boiling hot water to fill crevices. 
Add one level teaspoonful of salt to 
each quart. Sterilize in hot water for 
120 minutes. 

Pumpkin and Squash. — For pie 
filling, cut up the squash into con- 
venient sections, core, and remove 
skins. Cook for 30 minutes to reduce 
to pulp. Pack in glass jars or tin 
cans, add 1 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon- 
ful salt to each quart of pulp. Place 
rubber and top in position, partially 
seal, and sterilize for CO minutes in 
hot water. 

For canning pumpkin and squash 
for special dishes (fried, creamed, or 
baked) cut into small uniform size 
cubes, blanch in boiling water for 10 
minutes, plunge quickly in cold water, 
pack in jar until full, add boiling 
hot water and 1 level teaspoonful of 
salt to the quart, place rubbers and 
caps in position, partially seal, 
and sterilize 60 minutes in hot 
water. 

Eggplant. — Remove the skin and 
slice across the fruit. ]\Iake the slices 
about one-half or three-fourths of an 
inch thick. Blanch 3 minutes in boil- 
ing water to which has been added 
a tablespoonful of salt per quart. 
Plunge into cold water and pack in 
glass jars. Fill with boiling hot 
water and add a level teaspoonful of 
salt per quart. Put rubber and cap 
in position, partially seal, and sterilize 
50 minutes in hot water. 

Sweet Peppers. — Place either red 
or green peppers in the oven and bake 
until the skins separate from the 
meat. Remove the skins. Pack solid 
in glass jars. Add no boiling water. 
Add 1 level teaspoonful of salt per 
pint. Put the rubber and cap in posi-

tion, not tight. Sterilize in hot water 
for 90 minutes. 

Corn and Tomato Combination. — 
Blanch fresh corn on the cob 6 min- 
utes. Cold dip it. Cut the corn frorb 
the cob, cutting from tip to butt. 
Blanch the tomatoes li minutes and 
cold dip. Remove the skin and core. 
Chop the tomatoes into medium-sized 
pieces. Mix thoroughly 2 parts of to- 
matoes with 1 part of corn. Pack the 
mixture in glass jars, add a level tea- 
spoonful of salt per quart, put rubber 
and cap in position, not tight, and 
sterilize in hot water for 90 minutes. 

Corn, Tomatoes and String Beans 
Combination. — Use 1 part of corn, 
1 part of green string beans, and 3 
parts of tomatoes. Blanch fresh corn 
on the cob for 6 minutes and cold 
dip. Cut the corn from the cob, cut- 
ting from tip to butt. Prepare string 
beans and cut them into convenient 
lengths. Blanch them 4 minutes and 
cold dip. Blanch the tomatoes 1 to 
3 minutes and cold dip. Remove the 
skin and core. Cut the tomatoes into 
medium-sized pieces. Mix thoroughly. 
Pack the mixture in glass jars. Put 
the rubbers and caps in position, not 
tight, and sterilize in hot water for 
90 minutes. 

Cauliflower. — Use only the flowered 
portion. Blanch it 3 minutes. 
Plunge into cold brine (one-half 
pound salt to \2 quarts of water). 
Allow the cauliflower to remain in this 
brine for 1:3 hours. Pack in glass 
jars, fill them with boiling water and 
add a level teaspoonful of salt per 
quart. Put the rubber and cap in 
position, not tight, and sterilize in 
hot water for 45 minutes. 

Cabbagre or Brussels Sprouts. — Use 
small, solid heads. Cut them into 
convenient sections and remove the 
core. Blanch 10 minutes. Cold dip. 
(See cauliflower.) Pack in glass jars. 
Pour on boiling water and add a level 
teaspoonful salt per pint. Put the 
rubber and cap in position, not tight, 
and sterilize in hot water for 90 min- 
utes. 

Mushrooms. — Unless you are ab- 
solutely sure that j^ou know a miish- 
room when you see it, do not run the 
risk of gathering and using for food 



what you may think are mushrooms. 
A very large number of people are 
poisoned every year in this manner. 
There are a number of poisonous 
plants which resemble the edible 
mushroom. Can mushrooms imme- 
diately after picking; if allowed to 
stand they become unfit for use. 
Wash and trim the mushrooms. If 
small, can them whole, if large, cut 
into sections. Blanch the mushrooms 
in boiling water for 5 minutes. Re- 
move and plunge them quickly into 
very cold water. Pack them in glass 
jars, add boiling water to cover them, 
and add 1 level teaspoonful of salt 
to the quart. Place rubber and cap 
in position, not tight, and sterilize in 
hot water 90 minutes. 

TROUBLES IN CANNING 

Canner's " flat sour " is a common 
trouble in canned corn, beets, beans, 
and asparagus. The canned product 
before being opened shows no signs 
of being spoiled, but when opened has 
a sour taste and disagreeable odor. 
To avoid this use only a fresh prod- 
uct which has been gathered not more 
than 5 or 6 hours, blanch, cold dip, 
pack one jar at a time, and place each 
jar in the eanner as soon as packed. 
The first jars in will not be affected 
by tlie extra cooking. 

The chief difficulty with corn is fail- 
ure to recognize the proper time to 
pull the ears, which is just between 
the milk stage and the dough. If 
corn is gathered after the dough 
stage has been reached the product 
will have a cheesy appearance. 
Blanch on the cob, not longer than 5 
minutes, ])lunge in cold water, cut 
from the cob with a sharp knife, and 
pack into sterilized jars as rapidly 
as possible. To this end it is desirable 
to have two persons cut and one fill, 
but if one person works alone he 
should fill a jar as soon as he has 
cut off sufficient corn, prepare it and 
place it at once in the eanner. The 
longer the finely cut product is ex- 
posed to the air the more bacteria, 
spores, and molds accumulate, and the 
greater the liability that some of them 
may not be destroyed in the steriliz- 



488

ing process. Hence the more speed 
the better, provided no essential of 
the process is overlooked. No more 
corn should be blanched and cold 
dipped than can be cut oflf at once, 
and the cold dip should not be pro- 
longed, A mere plunge into the cold 
water is suflBcient. 

Peas for canning should be care- 
fully looked over, all split and broken 
ones being removed, and this vege- 
table should be handled very gently 
in the blanching and cold dipping 
process. Otherwise, although the 
peas may keep well, the liquid will 
show a cloudy or hazy appearance. 
Peas that are too old will sometimes 
crack if the blanching is not carefully 
done, and cause the liquid to become 
cloudy. Hard water also has a tend- 
ency to cause cloudiness. 



How to Open a Jar. — Run a thin 
knife blade under the rubber next 
to the jar and press against the jar 
firmly. If this does not let in enough 
air to release the pressure on the top, 
pour fairly hot water onto the top of 
the jar, or, if necessary, place the jar 
in a deep sauce-pan of water, bring to 
a boil and keep boiling a few minutes. 
It will then open easily. 

A convenient can wrench for open- 
ing screw top fruit jars may be read- 
ily improvised out of a piece of 
heavy copper wire. Simply bend the 
wire about two-thirds of the way 
around the top of the jar, then bend 
the ends backward upon themselves to 
give the hand a good grip. Roughen 
the inside of the wire with a file so 
that it will not slip, and the device 
will be found to work perfectly.

"ff All vinegar, of which there are 

several kinds, consists of a dilute so- 
lution of acetic acid in water with 
a small amount of sugar and other 
organic matter. Vinegar is the result 
of the action of the oxygen of the 
air, in the presence of a particular 
kind of yeast or ferment, upon a so- 
lution of alcohol. The alcoholic liq- 
uors from which vinegar is made 
may be produced by the fermenta- 
tion of almost any vegetable or fruit 
juices. The principal kinds of vine- 
gar are, accordingly, wine vinegar, 
produced from grapes; malt vinegar, 
from barley; cider vinegar, from 
apples; sugar and molasses vinegar, 
from cane sugar products; corn vine- 
gar; beet vinegar; etc. The alcoholic 
fluid, or " wash," as it is called, should 
contain not over 4 per cent to 12 per 
cent of alcohol. And for the best re- 
sults the temperature should be from 
70 per cent to 85 per cent Fahrenheit. 
Plenty of air to introduce the oxygen 
required by the process must be sup- 
plied and mixed with the alcoholic 
solution. The changing of alcohol to 
acetic acid by the action of oxygen 
produces heat and increases the 
weight of the liquid. 

Commercial vinegar is made on the 
Continent of Europe principally from 
cheap grades of wine, in England 
from malt and sour beer, in the 
United States from elder and cheap 
grades of alcoholic liquors, as whisky 
and the like. 

Methods of Making Vinegar. — 
There are two principal ways of 
making vinegar — the slow and the 

489 



quick process. In the former the al- 
coholic solution is placed in a barrel 
or vat containing a little old vinegar 
or mother, which supplies the neces- 
sary yeast, or in the case of wine 
vinegar, old wine lees, either exposed 
to the sun or placed in a warm room. 
Air is admitted through the bung of 
the casks or otherwise, and the liquid 
is allowed to stand until it turns to 
vinegar. This takes two weeks or 
more in summer, and a month or 
more in cold weather. The process is 
similar to that of making cheap vine- 
gar from molasses and yeast, or mak- 
ing ordinary cider vinegar. 

Or to make vinegar by the quick, 
or German process, prepare a special 
contrivance as follows: 

Su})ply a large vinegar cask with 
a false bottom about a foot from 
the true bottom perforated with a 
large number of i inch gimlet holes. 
If a fine quality of vinegar is desired, 
cover this with one or more thick- 
nesses of white flannel cloth, and an 
inch layer of clean white sand on top. 
Bore, around the outside of the bar- 
rel an inch below the false bottom, a 
row of i inch auger holes slanting 
downward from without 2 or 3 inches 
apart. These arc necessary to admit 
the air. Fill the barrel from the false 
bottom to within 4 or 5 inches of the 
top with maple, beech, or basswood 
chips previously soaked for three or 
four days in first-class vinegar. 

Now cut another cask of somewhat 
smaller size in halves. Bore the Ijot- 
tom of one half barrel full of gimlet 
holes the size of a goose quill or 



490 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



about i inch in diameter. Cover this 
with cotton batting or yarn, and 
place it on top of the barrel resting 
on cross slats or u})on the chips. 

Insert a spigot into the cask below 
the false bottom, slanting downward 
to the bottom of the cask but having 
its opening just below the level of 
the row of air holes, and place be- 
neath the sjjigot the other half barrel, 
protected by a wooden cover from 
dust and dirt. 

The alcoholic liquor poured into 
the upper half barrel causes the yarn 
or cotton in the bottom to swell and 
fill the gimlet holes, whence the liquor 
drops through upon the chips. The 
process of fermentation produces 
heat, which causes a current of air to 
rise through the openings for that 
purpose below the false bottom, and 
to meet the alcoholic liquor as it per- 
colates drop by drop through the 
chips. The air current escapes be- 
tween the bottom of the upper half 
barrel and the top edges of the large 
cask. Thus the action of the oxygen 
in the air in turning the alcohol into 
acetic acid is made very rapid. 

The vinegar, after passing through 
the sand and flannel strainer, and the 
false bottom, accumulates in the bot- 
tom of the barrel but cannot escape 
through the spigot until it reat'hes 
the level of its mouth, or a depth of 
8 or 10 inches. It is then first drawn 
from the bottom where its strength 
is greatest. And the strong vinegar 
thus accumulated assists in the proc- 
ess of fermentation. 

To use this apparatus, pour in 
about 4 gallons of alcoholic liquor or 
" wash " every hour with the addition 
of 1 quart to make up for the waste. 
And withdraw every hour about 4 
gallons of vinegar from the bottom. 
The first product must be ladled 
back into the upper half barrel, rim 
through again and again, when it will 
be converted into vinegar in three or 
four days. It must then be poured 
into a clean tank or cask, and one or 
two quarts of molasses added to it 
each day, until the molasses settles in 
a bed 3 or 4 inches thick. This im- 
proves the flavor of the vinegar and 
gives it a fine color. This process 
is the quickest and most satisfactory 



that has ever been devised. And as 
the apparatus is inexpensive, and the 
product is more salable than ordinary 
vinegar, there would seem to be no 
reason why it could not be utilized by 
grocers and other dealers in vinegar, 
or bj' private families or individuals 
either for domestic use or for sale. 

Water for Vinegar. — Pure soft or 
distilled water ought to be used for 
the manufacture of good vinegar, and 
if the water is not pure it should be 
purified by filtering through char- 
coal. 

Wash or liquors for Vinegar. — 
The commonest alcoholic liquor used 
for commercial vinegar in this coun- 
try consists of about 3 gallons of 
corn whisky, 4 gallons of good com- 
mercial vinegar, and 33 gallons of 
pure water. 

Or 50 gallons of 60 per cent whisky 
and 37 gallons of beer or maltwort. 

Or 2 gallons of brandy, 4 gallons 
of vinegar, and 12 gallons of water, 
with the addition, to promote fermen- 
tation, of about 1 gallon of an infu- 
sion of equal parts bran and rye meal. 

Or use li pounds of sugar to each 
gallon of pure water. 

Or i gallon of water to 2 gallons 
of cider. Add to the above in all 
cases 2 quarts of yeast to every bar- 
rel of the liquor. 

To Ferment Vinegar. — The proc- 
ess of making vinegar requires the 
presence of the minute vegetable or- 
ganisms called yeast, and is greatly 
hastened by conditions favorable to 
their growth. This is the reason that 
vinegar is made more rapidly in hot 
than in cold weather, and that the 
temperature of 75"^ to 80° F. hastens 
the process. The germs of yeast are, 
of course, present in large numbers 
in the lees and mother of old vine- 
gar and also in the vinegar which 
is soaked into the fiber of the cask. 
Hence an old vinegar barrel, if 
sound, is preferable to a new one. 
The germs of yeast are also present 
in ordinary vinegar, and if 1 gallon 
of sound vinegar can be added to 
each 3 or 5 gallons of cider or other 
alcoholic liquor or " wash " from 
which vinegar is to be made, no other 
yeast will be necessary. 

Or good brewers' yeast may be 



VINEGAR, PICKLES AND PICKLING 



4.91 



added to the alcoholic liquor at the 
rate of about | of a pint to each 12 
gallons. 

Or homemade hop yeast at the rate 
of 1^ pints to 12 gallons. The 
" wash " should be at a temperature 
of about 75° or 80° F. when the yeast 
if. added, and should be kept at or 
near that temperature while the vine- 
gar is being made. Yeast must not 
be scalded as a temperature above 
140° F. kills it. When old vinegar 
barrels are employed, or ordinary 
vinegar is put into new casks to has- 
ten fermentation, care must be taken 
that the vinegar formerly made in 
the casks, or used for this purpose, 
is of the same kind and of at least 
equally good quality to the desired 
product. That is, if a fine quality of 
cider vinegar is desired, only casks 
that have been used in making pure 
cider vinegar, or the best grade of 
cider vinegar itself should be used in 
the process. 

Or boil until tender 1^ pints of 
shelled corn to each gallon of the 
" wash " and add this in place of 
yeast to promote fermentation. When 
the vinegar is sour enough, strain it 
through cheese cloth to remove the 
corn and let stand another week to 
clarify. 

Money in Vinegar. — Grocers and 
other merchants who sell vinegar at 
retail should make their own vinegar. 
They can thus, by employing only the 
best materials, guarantee a pure ar- 
ticle. They can also materially in- 
crease their profits. In fact, any per- 
son living in the country or small 
town, can profitably manufacture 
vinegar for family use and also, if de- 
sired, by producing a pure and genu- 
ine article can build up a neighbor- 
hood trade. To do this it is only 
necessary to leave samples, with price 
attached, at the neighboring houses 
and keep always on hand a sufficient 
quantity of first-class vinegar. The 
commercial article is so often adul- 
terated with injurious acids that most 
persons will prefer to buy homemade 
vinegar at the market rates or bet- 
ter and a satisfactory profit will be 
assured. 

Cheap Molasses Vinegar. — To make 
vinegar by the slow process, fill a 



large jug, keg, or cask with a mix- 
ture consisting of 1 quart of best 
New Orleans molasses, 1 pint of 
yeast to each 3 gallons of warm rain 
water. Tie a piece of cheese cloth 
over the bung to keep out dust and 
insects, but to admit the air. Place 
the receptacle out of doors in the sun 
during hot weather. Or in cold 
weather let it stand near the kitchen 
stove. It will be converted into vine- 
gar in from three weeks to a month. 
When it gets low, draw ofi' a supply 
for family use, leaving more or less 
old vinegar with the mother and lees 
in the bottom of the cask. Fill up 
with new liquid in the same propor- 
tions, and let stand until converted 
into vinegar as before. 

Or dissolve i a pound of light- 
brown " A " or coffee sugar in 2 gal- 
lons of soft warm water. Add 3 
pints of homemade hop yeast or li 
pints of good brewers' yeast to each 
12 gallons. Pour all into a suitable 
keg or cask. 

Or a firkin may be used if litted 
with a tight cover having one or 
more auger holes to admit air through 
it. Fill the receptacle about two- 
thirds full, or a little more, so as to 
expose as large a surface as possible 
to the air. Cover the openings with 
cheese cloth and let stand in a warm 
place. Where the conditions are fa- 
vorable it will be converted into vine- 
gar in about two weeks or a month. 

Or for a somewhat better quality, 
take 5 gallons of water to 1 gallon of 
molasses, and add a quart of yeast. 
The addition of a gallon of good vine- 
gar will hasten the process. Odds 
and ends of sirup, as rinsings from 
fruit jars, molasses cans, and the like, 
may be added to the liquor from time 
to time. 

Or for a cheaper quality, take 25 
gallons of warm rain water, 4 gallons 
of molasses, and 1 gallon of brewers' 
yeast. 

Cider Vinegar. — The best quality 
of vinegar is undoubtedly that made 
from cider, providing the apples used 
are sound, ripe, sweet fruit. As the 
best grades of cider vinegar bring a 
fancy price, it is advisable to separate 
ripe, sweet windfalls from small, un- 
ripe, or defective fruit, and use the 



4m 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 






best fruit for an A 1 grade of cider. 
The usual careless method of making 
cider is merely to fill a cask to its 
capacity with cider and let it stand 
four to six months to sour. But, with 
proper care and attention, a better 
grade of cider can be made in a much 
quicker time. The better way is to 
place the cider in a hogshead or 
large tank. Lay the ripening casks, 
with the bungholes open, on their 
sides, exposed to the heat of the sun 
or in a warm cellar, and fill them at 
first only about a quarter full of 
cider. After about two weeks, add 
another quarter, making the barrel 
half full, and after two weeks more 
do the same, leaving the cask about 
three quarters full. Thus a consider- 
able flat surface inside is left exjiosed 
to the air. Once a day for the first 
few weeks draw from the spigot a 
gallon or more of cider and pour it 
from a considerable height through a 
funnel into the bunghole. This keeps 
the cider full of air. Also, put into 
each barrel a pound or more of bread 
dough, prepared as for making ordi- 
nary wheat bread, in the state in 
which it is ready to be put into the 
oven. 

Other methods recommended for 
hastening the process of fermentation 
are the addition of a quart or more 
of molasses to each cask, 2 ounces of 
brown sugar to each gallon of cider, 
or brown paper dipped in New Or- 
leans molasses. But the bread dough 
is perhaps to be preferred. The 
ordinary skunk-cabbage balls, which 
occur plentifully in swamps and 
meadows in many localities, are also 
employed for this purpose. 

Or the mother of vinegar from an 
old cider barrel will greatly hasten 
the process. 

White-Wine Vinegar. — Crush 2 
pounds of clean juicy raisins. Add 
a gallon of filtered rain water, place 
in a 2-galIon jug imcorked, and let it 
stand in a warm place. In about a 
month it will be converted into pure 
white-wine vinegar. 

Pour out the clear vinegar through 
a cheese-cloth strainer, leaving the 
raisins and sediment in the jug; add 
i pound of raisins in another gallon 
of water, and repeat the process. 



Corn Vinegar. — Boil in a gallon of 
rain water a pint of shelled Indian 
corn until the kernels burst. Pour 
the whole into a 2-gallon stone jug 
and add filtered rain water to supply 
that lost by evaporation, making a 
gallon all told. Dissolve i pound of 
granulated sugar in i pound of soft 
water by bringing it to a boil. Pour 
into the jug; shake well. Cover the 
mouth of the jug with two or three 
thicknesses of cheese cloth. Let stand 
in a warm place at a temperature of 
75° or 80° F. It will be converted 
into vinegar in about a month. Pour 
off this vinegar into another jug, 
leaving about half the mother, and 
repeat the process. 

To preserve this vinegar, cover the 
mouth of the jug with a piece of 
cloth and store it in a dry, warm 
place. This recipe makes vinegar 
about as cheaply as it can be made, 
and gives a quality that is preferred 
by many to ordinary cider vinegar. 
It is worth trying. 

To Clarify Vinegar. — To clarify 
vinegar for bottling, draw it off into 
a clean cask or other vessel and throw 
into it a handful more or less of 
shredded isinglass. Let it stand for 
a few days and filter through a 
cheese cloth. 

Strength of Vinegar. — The strength 
of vinegar or the amount of acetic 
acid which is contained in different 
specimens, differs greatly. To deter- 
mine the proportion of acetic acid, 
suspend 4 or 5 ounces, by weight, of 
broken pieces of fine marble in 16 
ounces, by weight, of vinegar. The 
acetic acid will attack the marble 
and will be gradually neutralized. 
Let stand overnight. Remove the 
marble, rinse it in cold water, dry it 
thoroughly with gentle heat on top 
of the stove (but take care not to 
melt it), and weigh it carefully; g of 
its loss in weight is the quantity of 
actual acetic acid contained in the 
sample. And from this amount the 
proportion of acetic acid can be read- 
ily obtained. 

Good vinegar should contain about 
5 per cent, of absolute acetic acid. 
The commercial test is the num- 
ber of grains of pure carbonate of 
potassium that will exactly neutralize 



VINEGAR, PICKLES AND PICKLING 



493 



1 fluid ounce of vinegar. If 20 grains 
of carbonate of potassium are re- 
quired, the samjile is known as 20 
grains' strength. 

Purity of Vinegar. — Various min- 
eral acids, as sulphuric, nitric, hydro- 
chloric and others, are sometimes 
added to vinegar as adulterants to 
increase its acidity, and for other 
purposes. Red pej^per, mustard, and 
other acrid substances are also used, 
and traces of copper and lead are 
sometimes derived from the vats or 
kettles in which the vinegar is pre- 
pared. 

Test for Sulphuric Acid. — Stir into 
a sample of suspected vinegar a small 
quantity of potato starch and bring 
to a boil. Remove from the fire and 
let stand until entirely cold. Add 
slowly, drop by drop, a solution of 
iodine. If the vinegar is pure, the 
iodine solution will produce the blue 
color of iodide of starch, but if sul- 
phuric acid is present the starch will 
have been converted by boiling into 
dextrin, and the blue color will not 
appear. 

Or dip a piece of writing paper in 
the vinegar and heat it over the 
stove; if the vinegar is pure, the pa- 
per will not be charred, but the pres- 
ence of 3 per cent, or more of sul- 
phuric acid will char it. 

Or a more delicate test consists in 
bringing to a boil a solution of i 
ounce of sugar in 16 ounces of water 
and when it reaches the boiling point 
dipping into it a china cup or saucer. 
If a drop of vinegar is let fall on this 
china surface while moistened with 
sirup at the temperature of boiling 
water (212° F.) if pure it will pro- 
duce no perceptible effect. But if it 
contains the slightest trace of sul- 
phuric acid it will produce a spot of 
color ranging from pale green to a 
darker bro\vn or black in proportion 
to the quantity of free sulphuric acid 
present. 

Test for Hydrochloric Acid.— To 
test for hydrochloric acid use the 
boiled potato-starch and solution-of- 
iodine test for sulphuric acid; the 
reaction will be the same. A blue 
color will indicate purity. 

Or add to the suspected sample a 
little silver nitrate, which, if hydro- 



chloric acid is present, will produce 
a white precipitate. 

Test for Nitric Acid. — To test for 
nitric acid, add a solution of indigo 
to the sample of vinegar and bring 
to a boil. The nitric acid can be de- 
tected by a yellow color. 

Tests "for Other Adulterants. — To 
discover the presence of red pepper, 
mustard, etc., boil down the vinegar 
until all the water it contains has 
been evaiJorated, when, if tliese sub- 
stances are present, the resulting ex- 
tract will have a sharp, biting taste. 

To test for copper, add potassium 
ferrocyanide, which will give a brown 
precipitate. 

To test for lead, add hydrogen sul- 
phide, which will give a black pre- 
cipitate, or potassium iodine, which 
will produce a yellow precipitate. 

PICKLES AND PICKLING 

Pickling Vegetables. — Almost 
every sort of esculent may be pre- 
served for table use by means of 
spiced vinegar. The objects to be 
obtained are to secure firmness or 
hardness of texture, to impart a fine 
bright green or other color, to kill all 
germs of decay that may be present, 
and to protect from the air. 

Firmness of texture is secured by 
steeping the vegetable in strong brine 
for a number of days, and by picking 
them over at intervals to discard all 
doubtful specimens. This may be 
done by lifting them from the brine, 
rinsing them and after they have been 
picked over, covering them with brine 
that is freshly made. The excess of 
brine ma}^ then be removed by fresh- 
ening them in pure salt water for 
twenty-four hours or more. 

A fine green is imparted by lining 
a kettle with fresh vine leaves and 
packing the pickles with these in al- 
ternate layers. The addition of pow- 
dered alum sprinkled among the lay- 
ers assists in setting or fixing the 
color. They are then covered with 
cold water and boiled for two hours 
or more until the color is satisfac- 
tory. Cooking, of course, softens 
them, but their freshness may be re- 
stored by dropjiing them into iced 
water for an hour or two. 



494 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Finally, scalding hot pickling liq- 
uid is poured over them both to kill 
the germs of decay and exclude the 
air. And this process may be re- 
peated by pouring off the pickling 
liquid, bringing it to a boil and again 
pouring it over them at intervals of 
every two or three days for a fort- 
night. The jars may then be sealed, 
or a layer of cotton batting tied over 
them to exclude the germs that float 
in the air, and thus they may be pre- 
served for years. 

To Select Cucumbers for Pickling. 

— Plant for pickles a variety of cu- 
cumbers that bears a large number 
of small cucumbers, only ;3 or 3 inches 
long when ripe. These are small, 
compact, and make firm, crisp pickles 
that are preferred by most persons 
to the large cucumber pickles, which, 
when ripe, are 5 to 7 inches long, 2 
to 3 inches thick, and full of seeds. 

Or use the small, unripe specimens 
of the large varieties. Cut the cu- 
cumbers from the vines carefully. 
Leave part of the stem on. And take 
care to handle them gently. If 
bruised they will become soft and de- 
cay. Pick the vines clean each morn- 
ing of all that are of a suitable size. 
This keeps the vines bearing. Pick 
them over carefully. Throw out any 
that are bruised or spotted in any 
way. And, if an Al quality of pickles 
is desired, either for home use or for 
sale, sort them into lots of uniform 
size and shape. 

To Preserve Cucumbers for Pickles. 

— Have ready two or more stout 
wooden tubs or earthenware jars, and 
in these each morning as fast as they 
are gathered pack the jiickles in lay- 
ers. First put on the bottom of the 
vessel a layer of salt ^ inch thick, 
then a layer of cucumbers. Over 
them put a layer of salt about ^ inch 
thick. When about 30 cucumbers 
have been packed in this way, add a 
large cupful of water. This will dis- 
solve the salt and make brine enough 
to cover the cucumbers. Put a stout 
board, with a stone on top, over the 
cucumbers to press them down in the 
brine. Continue to add more cucum- 
bers from time to time as they are 
ready, picking them if possible in the 
morning before the dew is off. Add 



salt and water until the keg is full. 
Weigh down the cucumbers securely 
under the brine and until ready to do 
them up store the keg in a cool cel- 
lar. Look at them now and then to 
be sure that they are kept under the 
brine, and add more brine, if neces- 
sary, to replace the water lost by 
evaporation. Let stand in brine ten 
days to two weeks, or until they be- 
come yellow. But they will not be in- 
jured if allowed to stand longer, pro- 
vided the brine covers them. 

Or after standing in cold brine for 
one week, lift them carefully from 
the brine with the hands, so as not to 
bruise them. Place the brine over the 
fire and bring it to a boil. Immerse 
the cucumbers in the brine while boil- 
ing hot. 

Or some authorities recommend 
that the brine be poured off, heated, 
and again poured over the pickles 
each day for a week or more, or every 
two or three days. But the belter i 
opinion seems to be in favor of steep- I 
ing or immersing them in cold brine ' 
for a longer period to draw out the 
rank juices that occur in all crude 
fruit rather than to pour scalding 
brine over them. Scalding is thought 
by manj^ to be unnecessary, and to 
tend to make the pickles soft. 

To Store Pickles. — Wooden tubs or 
casks are to be preferred for storing 
pickles in large quantities, or glass 
bottles or fruit jars for the finer 
qualities. There is an advantage in 
small bottles, crocks, or jars, as only 
a small quantity need be opened at a 
time. 

Porcelain, graniteware, aluminum, 
or new tinware are the most suitable 
vessels in which to heat the vinegar 
and the brine. Anything that has 
held grease will spoil pickles. 

If packed in wide-mouthed glass 
bottles or fruit jars, seal tightly, or 
cork and cover the corks with melted 
paraflBn or other bottle wax. But if M 
the pickles are laid down in jars or f 
kegs they should be looked over occa- 
sionally, and if any of them are soft 
they should be removed, the vinegar 
turned out, scalded, and again poured 
over the pickles. There must be suffi- 
cient vinegar to cover the pickles 
thoroughly, and it must be of at least 



VINEGAR, PICia.ES AND PICKLING 



495 



medium strength. If the vinegar be- 
comes weak, pour out and replace 
with fresh vinegar scalding hot. The 
addition of a little sugar when the 
pickles are looked over helps to keep 
them and improves their flavor. By 
the blending of the flavors of the va- 
rious ingredients, pickles, if properly 
laid down, should improve with age. 
Store pickles in a cold place, as if 
they are kept too warm they may be 
attacked by the small fly so familiar 
in autumn. 

Or to lay down pickles permanently 
in brine, cover them with boiling 
water and let stand until they are 
cold. Drain thoroughly. Put a layer 
of dry salt in the bottom of the bar- 
rel, put down a layer of pickles, cover 
with dry salt, and so continue. Add 
no water. Put a weight above them 
and their juice will furnish the neces- 
sary moisture to dissolve the salt and 
make sufficient brine to cover them. 
A small quantity can be freshened 
from time to time and freshly pickled 
as required for use. But this method 
of laying down pickles is not the one 
commonly preferred. 

To Freshen Cucumbers. — After 
cucumbers have been steeped in brine 
until they are entirely yellow, and 
about three days before they are to 
be done up, lift them carefully from 
the brine into a clean vessel, cover 
them with clean cold water and let 
stand three or four days, changing 
the water each day or oftener to 
freshen them. 

To Pickle Cucumbers. — Pack the 
freshened cucumbers in wide-mouthed 
bottles or jars and pour over them 
either pure vinegar boiling hot or any 
desired pickle or spiced vinegar and 
seal. 

Or first pour over them pure vine- 
gar scalding hot and let stand in a 
warm place until they become green. 
Every two or three days pour ofl' the 
vinegar, reheat it and again pour 
it over the cucumbers scalding hot; 
when the color is satisfactory pour 
off the pure vinegar and cover them 
with the spiced pickle if desired. But 
while the above is recommended as a 
thorough method designed to prepare 
a high-grade quality of pickles, rec- 
ommendations of authorities differ 



very widely and good practice doubt- 
less varies equally as much or more. 
One authority recommends merely 
washing cucumbers in salt and water, 
and immediately bottling and cover- 
ing them with boiling hot pickle. 
Another, scalding fresh-picked cu- 
cumbers with boiling brine, and when 
cold draining and at once covering 
them with boiling vinegar. Another 
would cover fresh-picked cucumbers 
at once with boiling vinegar contain- 
ing a handful of salt, reheating the 
vinegar every two or three days until 
they become green, then pickling and 
sealing. Hence it may be inferred 
that preserving in brine before pick- 
ling is not necessary, but we prefer 
to recommend it for reasons already 
stated. 

Authorities also difi^er as to whether 
the brine should be cold or heated, 
and the length of time the cucumbers 
should be immersed in brine, and also 
as to whether it is sufficient to cover 
the cucumbers with scalding vinegar 
and immediately seal, or preferable 
to let them stand, reheating the vine- 
gar occasionally to green them. All 
of these questions must be decided by 
each person for himself according to 
the grade of pickles desired, and his 
willingness to take the necessary 
pains. In general, it is believed that 
the slower and more painstaking the 
process, the better will be the quality 
of the product. 

Dill Pickles. — Select cucumbers 
about four inches long, wash and wipe 
them, and place in layers in half gal- 
lon fruit jars. Between every al- 
ternate layer place a small bunch of 
dill, and a grape leaf. When the jar 
is full pour over brine made as fol- 
lows: to 1 cup of salt add 12 cups 
boiled and cooled water into which a 
tablespoonful of filum has been dis- 
solved. Seal perfectly air tight and 
keep in a dark place. They will keep 
all winter. 

Cucumber Pickles. — Fill a quart 
jar full of freshly gathered and 
thoroughly washed cucumbers. Small 
or medium preferred. Then add 1 
tablespoonful sugar, 1 tablespoonful 
salt dissolved in vinegar, 1 tablespoon- 
ful white mustard seed, 1 tablespoon- 
ful celery seed, if liked. Fill with

cold vinegar and seal. Pickles will 
be firm, crisp and fresh. — Mrs. A. F. 
Corrington. 

Olive Oil Pickles. — For 100 small 
cucumbers use 1 quart sliced onions, 
i cup celery seed, i cup white mus- 
tard seed, 1 cup olive oil, and i cup 
black pepper. Do not peel the cu- 
cumbers but slice them and put in 
layers with salt. Let stand 3 hours. 
Drain, add the onions, 1 tablespoonful 
alum and the celery seed, mustard 
seed, olive oil, and pepper, mixed to- 
gether. Then cover all with cold vin- 
egar and let stand from 24 to 36 
hours. They are then ready for the 
table or may be sealed up for future 
use. — I\Iargola Kyle. 

Utensils for Pickling. — It was for- 
merly customary to make pickles in 
kettles of brass or bell metal in order 
to give them a bright green color, 
and also to add more or less alum for 
the same purpose. But the action of 
the acetic acid contained in vinegar 
upon brass and similar metals is to 
produce a poisonous comi^ound, es- 
pecially if the pickles are allowed to 
stand in them until they become cold. 
The use of alum is also injurious, and 
for the same reason cheap earthen- 
ware, which is frequently glazed with 
lead, should not be employed. 

Many people have a prejudice 
against deep green pickles foimd on 
the market, on account of the fear 
that poisonous substances may have 
been used in the manufacture. Hence 
homemade pickles of a good color 
and flavor usually find a ready and 
profitable local market. 

To Test Pickles for Copper. — To 
find out if pickles are poisonous from 
having been cooked in brass or cop- 
per kettles, chop a sample of the 
pickle fine, place It in a glass bottle 
with a few drams of liquid ammonia 
diluted with about half as much water. 
Shake tlioroughly, and if there are 
any traces of copper in the pickles 
the contents will be of a deep blue 
color. 

Vinegar for Pickles. — White-wine 
or sugar vinegar is perhaps the most 
suitable for a fine grade of pickles. 
But any good quality of vinegar that 
is fully ripened and has been pre- 
viously clarified may be used. The 



vinegar should be boiled and freed 
from mother or sediment that would 
cause the pickles to ferment. 

To Clarify Vinegar. — Throw an 
oimce or so of shredded isinglass into 
each gallon of vinegar and let stand 
a few days to clear. Strain through 
cheese cloth. 

To Keep Vinegar Free from Mold. 
— Laj^ a small bag of thin muslin 
containing mustard on top of the 
pickles. If the vinegar has been 
properly boiled and clarified, it will 
tend to prevent the formation of mold. 
To Strengthen Weak Vinegar. — 
Pour it off the pickles, bring it to a 
boil, pour it back over tliem and 
add about i teaspoonful of alum and 
spread over the top layer a piece of 
brown paper soaked in New Orleans 
molasses. 

Or boil down the vinegar with very 
gentle heat so as to allow it to lose 
its surplus water by evaporation. 

Or allow it to freeze, and remove the 
ice before it melts. Acetic acid does 
not readily freeze. Hence the quan- 
titj^ of acid in proportion to the bulk 
of water becomes greater. 

Spiced Pickle. — The following reci- 
pes are recommended for pickling 
liquids for cucumbers and other vege- 
tables, mixed pickles, etc., including 
mushrooms, onions, walnuts, cucum- 
bers, cauliflowers, samphires, green 
gooseberries, barberries, radish pods, 
melons, French beans, tomatoes, lem- 
ons, peaches, garlic, peas, codlins, 
beet root, and red cabbage without 
brine and with cold vinegar. The 
smaller and more delicate vegetables 
should not be soaked in brine as long 
as the larger and the coarser sorts, 
and may in some cases be pickled 
cold by pouring over them strong 
pickling vinegar without scalding. 
Spices for pickles should not be 
ground, and should be slightly bruised 
or crushed in a mortar, which may be 
improvised by using a wooden bowl 
and a potato masher as a pestle, or 
the end of a hard piece of wood. 
When ground spices are used they 
should be tied up in bags of thin 
muslin. Any surplus of sirup remain- 
ing when putting up pickled peaches, 
pears, or other fruit may be put in 
separate jars, sealed, and set away

with the pickled fruit, to be used the 
following season. If the jars are 
opened and the spiced liquid re- 
heated once a year it will keep in- 
definitely, and the spice, sugar, and 
vinegar will be saved, besides the time 
that will be required for making new 
sirup. 

To make spiced pickle add to 1 
gallon of vinegar 1 cup of salt, 1 
cup of sugar, 1 handful of horse-rad- 
ish, 2 tablespoonfuls of mustard, 1 
green pepper. 

Or to every 2 quarts of vinegar add 
i ounce of mace, 1 ounce of ginger 
sliced, 1 dozen cloves, 1 ounce of black 
pepper, 1 handful of salt. Boil all to- 
gether for not more than five minutes, 
and pour over the pickles scalding hot. 

Or add to the above if desired 3 or 
4 cloves of garlic and shallots. 

Or to 3 quarts of pure white-wine 
or other strong vinegar add 2 ounces 
of ginger, ^ ounce of mace, * pound 
of salt, 4 tablespoonful of Cayenne 
pepper, 1 ounce of white or black 
pepper unground, 1 ounce of mustard 
seed, 4 ounces of shallots. Boil to- 
gether not more than five minutes and 
pour over cucumbers and other hard, 
firm vegetables scalding hot, or over 
small and delicate vegetables cold. 

Or crush together in a mortar 4 
ounces of unground black pepper, 2 
ounces of ginger root, 1 ounce of all- 
spice and 4 ounces of salt. Cayenne, 
paprika, or garlic may be added in 
small quantities if desired. Place a 
quart of vinegar in an enameled 
saucepan, and bring to a boil. Stir 
in these spices. Let boil not more 
than five minutes and pour over the 
pickles scalding hot for cucumbers, 
walnuts, and the like, or cold for cab- 
bage or fancy mixed pickles. 

To Pickle Large Cucumbers. — Pare 
7 pounds of large cucumbers, remove 
the seeds and cut into inch pieces. 
Cover with vinegar and water, half 
and half, and add a large pinch of 
salt. Boil until clear but not over- 
done. Drain in a colander. 

To one pint of good vinegar add 3J 
pounds of brown sugar; as soon as it 
comes to the boiling point put the cu- 
cumbers back into the kettle and let 
the whole boil up. Again drain 
through the colander, and when cold 



put them in layers in a jar, sprinkle 
between the layers stick cinnamon, 
cloves, allspice, a few kernels of black 
pepper, a little mace, and a handful 
of raisins. Cover with the pickling 
liquid and seal. 

Or cut a piece from the large end 
of each cucumber, leaving it attached 
by a piece of the skin. Scoop out the 
seeds and steep in strong brine for 
a week until entirely yellow. Stuff 
with equal parts mustard seed, ground 
ginger, and pepper, with the addition 
of small onions, shallots, or garlic if 
desired. Sew on the tojjs and cover 
with pickling liquid as for gherkins. 

To Pickle Melons and Mangoes. — 
Prepare as for large cucumbers, cut- 
ting off the top and stuffing the in- 
side with the same mixture. Or pickle 
as for gherkins. First steep in strong 
brine for a week or more, then freshen 
in clear water and pickle in pure vine- 
gar or spiced pickling liquid, as pre- 
ferred. 

Watermelon Pickles. — Peel and cut 
into two-inch pieces the rind from two 
melons. Let stand in salt water over 
night. Then boil in water until ten- 
der. Remove and drain well. Put 
on the stove 2 cups vinegar, 2 cups 
sugar, 1 cup water, few whole cloves, 
and 3 two-inch pieces of stick cin- 
namon. Let come to boil. Add 
melon and boil fifteen minutes. This 
will make 4 quarts pickles. — Mrs. B. 
H. Baker. 

Watermelon Pickles (quick). — For 
the rind of one medium sized water- 
melon use 3 pounds sugar, 1 quart 
vinegar, 65 cloves and 1 ounce cinna- 
mon stick. Peel watermelon rind, cut 
in strips, boil in salt water until ten- 
der, so you can pierce them with 
straw. Drain well. Dissolve sugar 
in vinegar, add spices and bring to 
a boil. Now add melon, let boil an 
hour, put up in glass jars, and seal. — 
Helen Starlaveather. 

Cucumber Mangoes. — Soak in 
strong brine nine days as many large 
green cucumbers as you wish to use. 
Then lay them forty-eight hours in 
clear water. Cut a slit lengthwise in 
each, scoop out seeds, wipe dry and 
fill with stoned raisins, lemon cut in 
long, thin strips, and 6 or 8 whole 
cloves. Tie up slit with white string,

pack cucumbers in a stone jar and 
cover with a boiling sirup made after 
following recipe: Add to 1 quart 
vinegar 5 pounds sugar, also mace, 
cinnamon, and cloves to taste. Re- 
heat sirup and pour boiling hot over 
cucumbers for nine successive morn- 
ings. — ^Irs. John F. Shafroth. 

Sweet Pickles — Cucumbers arid 
Melons. — Prepare as for gherkins by 
steeping in strong brine for a week 
or more. Quarter them, take out the 
seed and pulp, freshen in clear water 
for three or four days, and cover with 
a sirup prepared of sugar, ginger, and 
lemon as follows: 

Dip 1 pound of loaf sugar lump by 
lump in clear, soft water and place 
dripping wet in a porcelain saucepan. 
Stir in i ounce of bruised ginger and 
boil to the thread, stirring in the 
juice and grated rind of one lemon. 
Pour over the melons cold. 

To Green Pickles. — If fresh grape- 
vine leaves are obtainable, line a ket- 
tle with these and pack into it the 
cucumbers, etc., in alternate layers 
with vine leaves, and put a thick 
layer of vine leaves on top. In addi- 
tion, sprinkle powdered alum, if de- 
sired, among the layers and over the 
top. Fill up the "kettle with cold 
water and cook or steam the contents 
over a slow fire for two hours, or until 
the color is satisfactory. Drain off 
the hot water through a colander, im- 
merse the vegetables immediately in 
iced water, and let stand for an hour 
or more to harden. Then pack in a 
suitable vessel and pour scalding hot 
pickling liquid over them. 

Or the vine leaves may be used 
without the alum and will assist in 
giving a fine green color to the pickles. 

MIXED PICKLES 

To make cheap mixed pickles have 
at hand a keg containing vinegar and 
put into it from time to time odds 
and ends of vegetables, as small green 
beans, young cucumbers, small onions, 
radish pods, bits of cauliflower, and 
the like, adding vinegar from time to 
time to keep the vegetables covered. 
Thus any odd vegetables can be pre- 
served without expense except for the 
vinegar, spice, etc., and with very lit- 



tle trouble. When the keg is nearly 
full place the contents in a suitable 
kettle with vine leaves and boil them 
about two hours. 

Drain off the hot vinegar, immerse 
the vegetables in cold water for an 
hour or more to harden, add spices 
to the vinegar, boil for five minutes, 
drain the vegetables thoroughly, place 
them in a suitable keg or jar and pour 
the scalding hot pickling liquid over 
them. 

Or take any assortment of succu- 
lent vegetables, as small French beans 
or uniform size, small select gherkins 
2 or 3 inches long, small cucumbers 
sliced, and prepare them as for ordi- 
nary cucumber pickles. 

Prepare scinirately such vegeta- 
bles as broccoli, cauliflower stripped 
into branches, small pickling onions 
peeled, small red peppers, capsicums, 
radish pods, small fruit, white and 
red cabbage, celery, nasturtium seeds 
and the like by steeping for a short 
time, say two or three days, in brine 
and slightly freshening them. Now 
pack the gherkins and sliced cucum- 
bers with the other vegetables in wide- 
mouthed glass bottles or jars in such 
a way as to show the greatest va- 
riety of color and display the con- 
tents to the best advantage. Much 
of the attractiveness and consequent 
salabilitv of mixed pickles is due to 
skillful packing. Cover with any of 
the above spiced liquids recommended 
for cucumber pickles. 

Or prepare a special pickle con- 
taining turmeric, which will improve 
the color. For each gallon of vinegar 
mix 4 ounces of ginger, 4 ounces of 
turmeric, 2 ounces of white pepper, 

2 ounces of chili pepper, 2 ounces of 
allspice, 1 ounce of garlic, i ounce of 
shallots, * pound of bay salt. Bruise 
together in a mortar and boil in the 
vinegar not to exceed five minutes. 
Pour this liquid scalding hot over the 
vegetables and when cold slice in i 
pound of horse-radish and stir in 1 
pound of mustard seed. 

Or for each gallon of vinegar mix 

3 ounces of bay salt, i pound of mus- 
tard, 2 ounces of turmeric, 3 ounces 
of ginger, 1 oimce of cloves, * ounce 
of black pepper, cayenne, or paprika 
to taste. Bruise the spices in a mor-

into suitable cans or jars, and seal. 

Or for sweet chowchow, cut into 
inch cubes 2 dozen small cucumbers, 
6 green peppers, or 3 green and 3 red 
peppers, and 2 quarts of green toma- 
toes. Add 2 quarts of small button 
onions, 2 heads of cauliflower picked

a colander. Add a dressing composed 
of ^ pound of mustard with 2 table- 
spoonfuls of curry powder stirred to 
the consistency of cream with vine- 
gar. Mix well and seal in glass jars 
or wide-mouthed bottles. 

Spanish Peppers. — Steep in brine 
for three days ^ dozen good-sized cu- 
cumbers. On the second day slice ^ 
dozen onions and chop fine * peck of 
green tomatoes and 2 heads of cab- 
bage. Sprinkle these with salt and 
let stand overnight. Now drain the 
cucumbers from the brine, cut in

Pour into wide-mouthed glass bottles 
or jars, seal, and keep in a cool place. 

Piccalilli, or Indian Pickle. — This 
consists of a great variety of succu- 
lent vegetables (the more varied tlie 
better) mixed and pickled together. 
To make piccalilli slice 1 hard white 
cabbage head, remove the outer leaves, 
pull to pieces 2 cauliflowers, add 20 
selected French beans, 1 root of horse- 



radish, sliced fine, 2 dozen pickling 
onions, 1 dozen green gherkins of uni- 
form size. Let stand in brine three 
or four days, drain through a colan- 
der, and place in a preserving kettle. 
Add 2 ounces of curry powder, 1 
ounce of garlic, 1 ounce of ginger, 1 
ounce of white mustard seed, ^ ounce 
of capsicum or paprika. Cover with 
vinegar and bring to a boil. Preserve 
in glasses tightly sealed. 

Or pull apart the branches of a 
large head of cauliflower, cut a hard 
white cabbage head in quarters, re- 
move the outer leaves, chop it fine or 
shred it as for cold slaw. Slice a 
number of cucumbers and pickling 
onions, French beans, radish pods, 
nasturtiums, samphire, and any other 
vegetables at hand. Place tiiese in 
a large sieve, sprinkle them with salt 
and lay them out in the sun for three 
or four days to dry. Now place them 
in a preserving kettle, cover with cold 
vinegar, and bring to a boil. Let 
them boil up once. Pack in glass and 
seal. 

Or if it is desired to make an extra 
quality, keep all the ingredients sepa- 
rate and scald them separately in hot 
vinegar, but do not put them together 
until they are cold. Bruise together

through cheese cloth and add 1 pound 
of mustard rubbed up free from 
lumps with a small quantity of cold 
vinegar. Tlien dilute with more vine- 
gar to the consistency of milk and 
stir into the pickling liquid. When 
the pickling liquid is cold pour it 
over the pickles. Mix well and pack 
in glass bottles or a large jar corked 
or scaled to exclude the air. 

Piccalilli if well prepared should 
improve witli age. 

Chowchow. — Chowchow is the Chi- 
nese name for a kind of mixed pickles 
originally imported from that coun- 
try and similar to piccalilli or Indian 
pickle, except that the ingredients 
are minced fine and mixed together. 
Chowchow is frequently used to stuff

pickled peppers. It is sometimes 
known as English chowchow on ac- 
count of its popularity in that coun- 
try. French chowchow is a name 
sometimes applied to mustard pickles. 
To make Chinese or " English " 
chowchow chop fine 2 medium-sized 
heads of firm, white cabbage, i peck 
of green tomatoes, 2 quarts of firm 
ripe tomatoes, ^ dozen of green pep- 
pers, and 2 red peppers. Mix all to- 
gether and pack in a bag of coarse 
burlap or linen in layers of 2 or 3 
inches deep, mixed between with lay- 
ers of salt. Improvise a rack of slats 
of wood laid over the top of the bar- 
rel or keg into which it can drain. 
Place the chowchow on this and put 
over it a heavy weight. Let stand 
twenty-four hours under this pres- 
sure. Remove, pour out into a large 
pan and add li pints of sugar, i cup- 
ful of grated horse-radish, i tea- 
spoonful of ground mustard, 1 ounce 
of white mustard seed, 1 ounce of 
celery seed, 1 tablespoonful of mace, 

1 gill of Dutch mustard. Stir well, 
pack in glass or wood and seal. 

Or for another sort of chowchow 
slice or chop fine, as preferred, i peck 
of tomatoes, 1 quart of green peppers, 

2 quarts of onions, 1 medium-sized 
cabbage head shredded as for cold 
slaw, and 1 quart of white mustard 
seed. Keep these ingredients sepa- 
rate and pack in layers in a jar or 
tub, first tomatoes, next peppers, next 
onions, next cabbage. Sprinkle over 
this part of the mustard seed, and so 
continue, repeating the layers again 
and again until all has been packed. 
Pour over this any strong liquid de- 
sired, scalding hot. Let stand twenty- 
four hours, pour the whole into the 
preserving kettle, bring to a boil and 
let boil not more than five minutes. 
Pack down in suitable jars or tubs 
and seal. 

Bengal Chutney. — To make this 
celebrated Indian condiment, mix to- 
gether 1 pound of tamarind pulp, 1 
pound of sultana raisins, 1 pound of 
ripe tomato pulp, 1 pound of sweet 
apples minced fine; extract and add 
the juice of 12 lemons, grate and stir 
in the rinds; add 4 ounces of garlic, 
6 onions chopped fine, * pound of red 
chilis, 12 ounces of powdered ginger, 



1 pound of brown sugar. Place all 
together in a tub or jar, cover with 
a gallon of strong vinegar, and let 
stand for a month or more in a warm 
place, stirring occasionally until it 
is well fermented. Pack in small, 
wide-mouthed glass bottles and seal 
tightly. 

Cucumber and Onion Pickles. — Cut 
into thick slices 3 large onions to 
each dozen cucumbers. Place in a col- 
ander or sieve, sprinkle with salt and 
let stand twenty-four hours. Place 
in a suitable keg or jar, cover with 
boiling vinegar. Cover tightly and 
let stand overnight. Boil up the vine- 
gar each day, pour over them scald- 
ing hot, and at once cover tightly to 
exclude the air. When the color is 
satisfactory pour over them spiced 
pickling liquid and seal. 

PICKLED VEGETABLES, NUTS, AND 
FRUITS 

To Pickle Tomatoes. — Slice i peck 
green tomatoes, bring to a boil i gal- 
lon of any good spiced pickling liq- 
uid, and put the tomatoes to boil in 
this for a quarter of an hour. When 
cold pack away in tubs or jars and 
seal. 

Or slice 1 peck of green tomatoes; 
sprinkle with salt. Let stand two 
days. Slice and salt separately 12 
medium-sized onions. Mix in a bowl 
4 ounces of mustard, i ounce of mus- 
tard seed, 1 ounce of cloves, 2 ounces 
of turmeric, and add garlic, capsi- 
cum, or paprika to flavor if desired. 
Put in a preserving kettle a layer of 
onions, sprinkle with mixed spice, then 
a layer of tomatoes and spice, and so 
on. When all are packed pour over 
them boiling vinegar and simmer for 
about two hours until the color is 
satisfactory. 

Pickled Onions. — To prepare onions 
for pickling, " top and tall " them, 
remove the outer skins and steep 
them in brine for a period of two or 
three days, to two weeks or more. 
Afterwards freshen them in clear 
water for a period of one to three 
days. 

Or if preferred, boil them in clear 
water or brine for ten or fifteen min- 
utes. Afterwards pack them in wide-

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



mouthed glass bottles or jars, and 
cover with pure vinegar or spiced 
pickling liquid scalding hot or cold. 
When cold seal for use. The addition 
of a spoonful of olive oil to each hot 
tie is said to keep the onions white. 
Cork tightly and cover the corks with 
bottle wax or melted parafiin. Seal 
with cotton batting. 

To Select Pickling Onions. — Choose 
for pickling small silver-skin button 
onions, preferably of uniform size. 
Gather them when they are quite dry 
and ripe and pick them over care- 
fully, rejecting any that are soft, un- 
ripe, or spotted. 

To Pickle Onions Cold. — Place the 
onions in a clean, dry glass bottle or 
jar, cover them with cold vinegar and 
add mixed spices as preferred. Add 
a little mustard seed, mace, and cap- 
sicum, or allspice and black pepper 
unground or grated, or sliced horse- 
radish or garlic, capsicum and pa- 
prika, if desired. Seal the bottle and 
let stand two or three weeks before 
using. Onions are very easily pickled 
in this way and have an exquisite 
flavor, but will not keep more than 
about six or eight months. 

To Pickle Onions with Brine. — 
Cover the onions with cold brine and 
let stand two weeks or more, or steep 
in strong brine for one week, then 
heat the brine and pour it over them 
scalding hot. 

Or pour over them at once strong 
and hot brine and let stand two or 
three days. After steeping in brine 
drain through a colander, freshen 
in clear water for twenty-four hours, 
pour off the water and lay them on a 
dry cloth to drain. Pack them in 
jars or bottles and cover with spiced 
pickling liquid boiling hot. Cork 
tightly and seal. 

Or pour over them cold pickling 
liquid or cold vinegar and seal. 

Pickled Cabbage! — Select firm, ripe 
heads of either white or red cabbage, 
or mix the two. Quarter them, re- 
move the outside leaves, and let them 
dry. Shred them as for cold slaw 
and lay them down in a suitable jar 
between layers of salt. Cover with 
strong spiced pickling liquid and 
seal. 

Or shred the cabbage, place it in a 



preserving kettle or suitable jars, 
and cover with boiling water. Let 
stand until cold. Drain. Add mixed 
spices and cover with cold vinegar, or 
cover with spiced pickling liquid. 

Or boil the cabbage in salted water 
until it is tender. The pickling liquid 
may be poured on cold or scalding 
hot. In the latter case let stand un- 
til perfectly cold. Seal air tight and 
store in a cool, dry place. 

Or if the jars are not air tight, 
after a few days oi)en them, fill up 
with vinegar and again seal. 

Pickled Cauliflower. — Cut the cau- 
liflowers on a dry, hot day, after the 
dew has evaporated and before they 
are fully blown. Slice and sprinkle 
them with salt, and let stand for two 
or three days. 

Or boil in salt and water until they 
are tender. Drain off' the water or 
juices, spread upon a dry cloth, cov- 
ering with another cloth, and let 
stand in a warm place for twenty- 
four hours. Pack in jars, cover with 
cold spiced pickling liquid and seal. 

Or place the cauliflowers in cold 
salt and water at the rate of 4 ounces 
of salt to 1 quart of water, and bring 
to a boil over a slow fire. Remove 
immediately and cover with cold 
spiced vinegar. 

Pickled Green Corn. — Pull tlie ears 
of corn when slightly overripe but 
not too hard. Take off the outer 
husks, leaving the corn well covered 
with the inner husks, and tie the lat- 
ter tightly at the top end. Pack the 
ears of corn thus prepared in a clean 
firkin or cask and cover with strong 
brine. When wanted for use soak in 
fresli water twelve hours or more, 
changing the water occasionally. 

Pickled Walnuts. — Pick small green 
walnuts about the first week in July 
or before the middle of the month, 
after which they are likely to become 
hard and woody. Test them by 
thrusting a strong pin through them, 
and discard all that are too old and 
hard. Scald them slightly in boiling 
water. Rub off' the outer skin be- 
tween cloths (or this may be omitted 
if ])referred), and put them into cold 
brine strong enough to bear u]i an 
egg. Thrusting a pin through them 
also allows the pickle to penetrate

more thoroughly and quickly than 
would otherwise be the case. Let 
thein stand a week or two, changing 
the brine every two or three days. 
Pour them out in a sieve or into a 
cloth strainer to dry and let them 
stand a day or two or until they turn 
black. Pack them in bottles or jars 
and pour over them spiced pickling 
liquid scalding hot. Let stand until 
cold and seal. 

Or if they are not to be sealed air 
tight, pour off the pickle each day 
for three or four days, bring it to a 
boil, take off the scum and pour over 
the walnuts scalding hot. 

Or instead of steeping in cold brine, 
place the walnuts in a strong brine 
and simmer for an hour or two. Ex- 
pose in a sieve or cloth strainer 
twenty-four hours or more, or until 
they turn black. Pack and cover with 
scalding hot spiced pickling liquid. 
Two to six months will be required 
before they are fit to eat. During 
this time they must be kept covered 
from the air either by sealing the 
jars or keeping them covered with 
vinegar. 

To Pickle White Walnuts. — Pick 
small green walnuts as above and 
pare them very thin, or until the 
whites appear. Place in cold brine 
strong enough to bear up an egg and 
simmer for five or ten minutes, but 
do not let them come to a boil. Drain 
and cover them with cold brine for 
twenty-four hours or more. Pour out 
in a sieve or cloth strainer, cover them 
with a cloth, dry them carefully be- 
tween clean, soft pieces of cloth and 
pack them down with blades of mace, 
nutmeg, and horse-radish. Cover with 
cold or hot vinegar and when cold 
seal tightly to exclude the air. 

Pickled Lemons. — Slice i dozen 
lemons, sprinkle them with salt, lay 
them down in a large glass jar and 
sprinkle among them 2 ounces of 
spice, 2 oimces of white pepper, J 
ounce of mace, i ounce of cloves, all 
bruised together in a mortar with | 
ounce of cayenne, 2 ounces of horse- 
radish, 2 ounces of mustard seed. 
Pour over them 2 quarts of vinegar 
scalding hot. This pickle is for im- 
mediate use, and will be ready in 
three days to a week. Red peppers, 



paprika, or garlic and shallots may 
be added if desired. 

Or cut i dozen lemons into six or 
eight pieces, cover with the mixed 
spices, as in the first recipe, place in 
a preserving kettle, cover with 2 
quarts of vinegar and boil a quarter 
of an hour. 

Or pack the lemons in a jar, set 
the jar in boiling water and boil for 
fifteen or twenty minutes. Let the 
jar stand in a warm place stirring 
daily for several weeks. Finally, 
bring to a boil, pack in small jars or 
bottles and seal. 

Or to pickle whole lemons, select 
small fruit and slit the rinds as if to 
take off the peel in quarters, but do 
not cut through the pulp. Cover the 
lemons with salt, and pack it down 
hard to fill these slits. Pack them on 
end in a dripping pan three or four 
days, or until the salt melts, and let 
them stand, turning them end for end 
in the liquor two or three times a 
day until the rinds are tender. To 
this liquor add sufficient spiced vine- 
gar to cover the lemons. Pack them 
in jars with mustard seed and garlic. 
Cover with any prepared pickling liq- 
uid and seal. 

Pickled Peaches. — Look over the 
peaches carefully, selecting the ripe 
fruit and discarding all that are soft 
or specked. Rub clean with a soft, 
dry cloth and stick into each large 
peach 4 or 5 cloves without the heads, 
and into each small one 2 or 3 cloves. 
Place in a preserving kettle 1 gallon 
of vinegar. Stir in 6 pounds of brown 
sugar and bring to a boil, removing 
the scum as fast as it appears. Pack 
the peaches in suitable bottles or 
jars. Pour the boiling sirup over 
them scalding hot and cover tightly. 
Let stand overnight, pour off the 
sirup once more, bring to a boil and 
again pour over the peaches. Do this 
for three or four days. Finally, pack 
in cans or bottles and seal while hot. 

Or for sweet-pickled peaches, allow 
i pound of sugar by weight for each 
pound of fruit. Put the sugar and 
peaches in layers in a preserving ket- 
tle and bi-ing to a boil. Add for each 
6 pounds of fruit a pint of vinegar 
and in the vinegar place a thin mus- 
lin bag containing a tablespoonful

cjicli of cinnamon, cloves, and mace. 
Pour the spiced vinegar into tlie 
peaches and sirup with the bag of 
spices, and boil for not more than 
five minutes. Take out the peaches 
with a skimmer, lay them on blotters 
to cool and continue boiling the sirup 
until it thickens. Pack the peaches 
in jars, fill to overflowing with boil- 
ing sirup, and seal at once. 

Or for 1 gallon peeled peaches, use 
3 pounds sugar, 1 pint pure cider 
vinegar, 5 dozen cloves, 6 sticks cin- 
namon. Boil vinegar, sugar, cinna- 
mon, and cloves fifteen minutes, then 
pour liquor over peaches and let stand 
over night in stone jar covered with 
a plate. Next morning pour off 
liquor and heat to boiling point, then 
add peaches to boiling liquor and 
let cook slowly until tender. Seal In 
glass jars. — Mrs. W. R. Stubbs. 

Pickled Pears. — The above recipes 
for pickled peaches may also be ap- 
plied to pickled pears. 

Or pack in a preserving kettle in 
alternate layers 10 pounds of ripe 
pears and 3 pounds of coffee sugar. 
Pour over them 1 quart of vinegar 
containing, in a thin muslin bag, 1 
ounce of cinnamon, 1 ounce of cloves, 
i ounce of mace. Slice and stir in 4 
ounces of citron and boil until the 
pears are tender. Take out the pears 
with a skimmer, boil the sirup half 
an hour or more until it is thick. Fill 
the jars or cans to overflowing and 
seal at once. 

Or prepare a sirup of li pints of 
vinegar and 3 pounds of fine sugar. 
Bring this to a boil. Place in a pre- 
serving kettle a peck of ripe fruit, 
peeled and cored, pour the sirup over 
it and boll until the fruit is tender, 
but not soft. Remove the fruit with 
the skimmer and pack it in jars. 
Preserve the sirup, which may be 
used again, and prepare a fresh sirup 
of 1* pints of vinegar and 2 pounds 
of coffee sugar. Place in this sirup 
a thin muslin bag containing an ounce 
each of any kind of mixed spices pre- 
ferred. Bring to a boil, fill the jars 
to overflowing, and seal. 

Pickled Cherries. — Fill a wide- 
mouthed glass bottle or jar with nice 
firm and medium ripe cherries. Add 
2 tablespoonfuls of salt, and fill the 



jars with cold vinegar. Seal and let 
stand six or eight weeks before using. 

Pickled Peppers. — Soak fresh bell 
peppers, either green or red, in strong 
brine for a week or two, changing 
every two or three days. Pack in 
suitable jars and cover with cold 
vinegar. The seeds tend to make the 
peppers very strong, and may be re- 
moved if less strength is desired. A 
few peppers added to pickled cucum- 
bers improves them very much, as the 
heat of the peppers is taken out by 
the vinegar and becomes blended with 
the cucumbers, giving them an agree- 
able flavor. 

Pickled Beets. — Select small red 
beets having the roots on and wash 
them carefully so as not to break the 
roots or the skin. Place in a large 
kettle, cover with plenty of water and 
boil three or four hours. Take them 
up carefully with a skimmer so as not 
to break the skins. Place them on a 
cloth strainer to cool and dry. When 
cold, quarter them or pack them in 
suitable jars, cover with pure or 
pickled cold vinegar, and seal so as 
to exclude the air. If not sealed it 
will be necessary to pour oft' the vine- 
gar occasionally, bring it to a boil 
and pour it scalding hot over the 
beets. 

Or after the beets have been boiled, 
pack them in jars and cover with hot 
brine strong enough to float an egg. 
When cool put the jars in a sauce- 
pan full of cold water, place it on 
the stove, and boil half an hour or 
more. Seal air tight while hot and 
store in a cool place. 

Nasturtiums. — Collect the seeds 
while young and tender. Place them 
in a double boiler, cover with strong 
cold brine. Let stand for an hour, 
then place on the stove and bring to 
a boil. When they boil up take them 
out of the skimmer, put them into a 
suitable jar, and cover them with 
boiling hot spiced pickling liquid. 

Or have at hand a jar of sweetened 
spice vinegar and into this drop nas- 
turtium seeds picked as they accu- 
mulate during the season before they 
become hard and woody. They make 
an excellent substitute for capers and 
an agreeable addition to salads or 
sandwiches.

Pickled Barberries. — To pickle bar- 
berries for a garnish, especially for 
cold meats, salads, and the like, se- 
lect the large, firm bunches of berries 
of a fine deep red. Remove the leaves 
and the discolored berries. Place 
them in jars and cover with brine 
strong enough to float an egg. Seal 
to exclude the air, or cover with par- 
affin or waxed paper. If any scum 
or mold appears upon the surface 
pour out the barberries on a cloth 
strainer, dry them between two 
cloths, and cover them witli fresh 
brine. 

Pickled Melons. — Take hard musk- 
melons that are late in ripening, cut 
out a circular piece around the stem 
about 3 inches across and through 
this oijening remove tiie seeds and 
scrape out any part that may be soft 
or ripe. Pack the melons in a wooden 
tub, fill them inside, and cover them 
with salt and let stand until the 
salt is melted. Remove them from 
the salt, rinse with pure water and 
fill with a mixture of chopped pep- 
pers and onions with a few shallots, 
a little garlic, and a quantity of 
bruised mustard seed. Close the 
opening with the plug, and fasten it 
with thread or with skewers made of 
toothpicks. Pack the melons in a tub 
or earthen jar and cover with spiced 
pickling liquid boiling hot. Remove 
and scald the spiced liquid every day 
for four or five days, pour it hack 
over the melons, and finally seal up 
the jars. 

Or stuff the melons with a picca- 
lilli or chowchow or any sort of 
mixed pickles, as desired. 

Pickled Citron. — Cut the citron 
into inch cubes, cover with weak 
brine. Let stand twenty-four hours 
and pour out on a cloth strainer to 
dry. For every gallon of spiced vine- 
gar add 4 ounces of coffee sugar, 
bring to a boil and pour over the 
citron boiling hot. Let stand three 
or four days, each day pouring off 
the pickling liquid from the citron, 
scalding it and pouring it back. Fin- 
ally, bring the whole to a boil and 
cook until the citron is very tender. 
Pack in suitable jars. Seal and store 
in a cool, dry place. 

Peach Mangoes. — Select large free- 



stone peaches and take out the stone 
through a slit in the side. Cover 
with weak brine scalding hot. Let 
stand until cool enough to handle. 
Lift out the peaches on a cloth 
strainer, and wipe dry with a clean, 
soft cloth. Now fill the cavity with 
mixed spices to taste, as white mus- 
tard seed, cloves, mace, cinnamon, 
grated horse-radish, ginger root, etc., 
softened by placing all together in a 
thin muslin bag and immersing for a 
few minutes in boiling water. Re- 
move the bag from the water, let the 
spices drip dry, fill the peaches, sew 
them up, pack them in jars, and fill 
to overflowing with a scalding hot 
sirup made of 1 pint of sugar in 3 
pints of vinegar. Seal white hot. 
Let stand a week or two before bring- 
ing to the table. 

Canning Tomatoes. — Select firm, 
ripe tomatoes, place them in a colan- 
der and dip them into boiling water 
just long enough to loosen the skin. 
Remove from the water, place them 
where they will drain, and carefully 
pull off the skin without injuring the 
fruit. Once more place in colander 
to drain and pack carefully in large 
glass jars or cans as full as they will 
hold. Place these in hot water, bring 
to a boil and seal. 

Or if tin cans are used, first apply 
with a soft brush fresh butter or un- 
salted lard to the inside of the can 
and its cover. This will jjrevent the 
fruit acid from attacking the tin and 
forming a poisonous compound. Seal 
with a bit of solder or putty, or lay 
over the top a cloth dampened with 
alcohol, run paraffin over this and 
draw over the top a piece of cotton 
batting. 

Tomato Catsup. — A favorite relish 
with most peojjle is tomato catsup, 
which may be prepared either by the 
cold process, or by boiling. For cold 
catsup mix 2 green and 2 red peppers, 
chop fine and add 1 cup white mus- 
tard seed. Mix separately 1 quart 
onions chopped fine and 1 pint of 
clioppcd celery and set aside to drain. 
Chop fine J peck ripe tomatoes and 
drain them. Now stir together the 3 
mixtures, sweeten and salt to taste, 
lay down the cold catsup in jars, 
cover with cold vinegar, and seal.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



For boiled catsup have read}' a 
deep kettle a little more than half 
full of boiling water, place the toma- 
toes in a wire basket or colander and 
dip them by means of a string 
through the handles, or otherwise, in 
the boiling water for 3 minutes. Re- 
move quickly and jslunge the basket 
for a moment into a pan of cold wa- 
ter, let drain for a few moments, and 
remove the peels, which will come off 
easily. Slice the fruit and bring to 
a brisk boil. Now drain off the juice 
and boil the pulj) slowly for four 
hours. For each peck of ripe toma- 
toes add 2 tablespoonfuls salt, 1 ta- 
blespoonful black pepper, 1 teaspoon- 
ful cayenne pepper, \ teaspoonful 
paprika, and 1 tablespoonful mustard. 
After stirring in the spices, boil one 
hour, cool, stir in 1 pint of vinegar, 
and seal in jars. 

Currant Catsup. — Pick over care- 
fully 2 pounds of ripe red currants 
and place them in a preserving kettle 
with f of a pound of granulated 
sugar. Cook until of the consistency 
of thick cream. Boil in a separate 
saucepan for not more than five min- 
utes I of a pint of vinegar, in which 
place a muslin bag containing i table- 
spoonful of ground pepper, and any 
other spices desired. Pour the spiced 
vinegar into the currants and sugar 
and bottle for use. 

Preserving Olives. — After opening 
a bottle of olives, if the remainder 
are not required for immediate use, 
pour off the liquid and cover with 
olive oil. This will keep the olives 
good and fresh for several weeks. 

walnut Catsup. — Pick young green 
walnuts about the first week in July, 
as for pickled walnuts, and squeeze 
the juice out of them under a press. 
Or run them through two or three 
times with a hat])in. Crush them 
with a wooden mallet, place in a keg 
or jar throwing in a handful of salt 
for each two dozen walnuts. Cover 
with water and let stand two weeks 
or more, stirring frequently. Squeeze 
out the liquor through cheese cloth 
into a preserving kettle. Moisten the 
walnuts with boiling hot vinegar and 
mash them to a pulpy mass. Pour 
on additional hot vinegar to cover 
them. Mix and squeeze out the vine- 



gar into the juice and brine in a pre- 
serving kettle. Add to each gallon 
of juice 12 or 14 ounces of mixed 
spices as desired, bruising the whole 
spices in a mortar, or placing the 
ground spices in a thin muslin bag. 
Flavor with cayenne, paprika, garlic, 
or shallots as desired, and boil one

pint of vinegar with 2 tablespoonfuls 
of brown sugar, and 2 or 3 ounces of 
mixed spices. Stir all together and 
boil down one half. Strain through 
cheese cloth and bottle when cold. 

Gooseberry Catsup. — Select goose- 
brrries that are ripe but not soft, 
pick them over carefully, and remove 
the stems and blossoms with a pair 
of small scissors. To each quart of 
gooseberries add 1 pound of brown 
sugar and 1 ounce of mixed spices. 
Place in a preserving kettle and boil 
to a soft pulp or for about 2 or 3 
hours stirring constantly. Add for 
each quart of gooseberries i pint of 
vinegar. Bring to a boil. Fill bot- 
tles to overflowing and seal while 
scalding hot. 

Grape Catsup. — Take grapes that 
are ripe but not soft. Pick them over 
carefully and add i by weight of 
sugar and to 5 pounds of grapes 1 
pint of vinegar, 2 or 3 ounces of

Stew them well, grind them through a 
flour sieve so as to remove the seeds 
and skins, reheat and can for soup 
stock. 

Or take the large, sound, ripe to- 
matoes, wash and drain, halve them 
crosswise, and pack them with the 
cut side up between layers of salt in 
a jar or wooden firkin. Let stand 
twenty-four hours or until the salt 
melts. Now pour off and discard the 
brine and seeds that escape with it. 
Boil the tomatoes to a pulp, and rub 
through a flour sieve. Season with 



cayenne pepper or paprika, salt to 
taste and boil to the consistency of 
cream, stirring briskly. Pour out to 
a depth of about i inch on large plat- 
ters, and let dry in the sun or a 
slow oven. Before it dries mark in 
3-inch squares with a sharp knife and 
when fully dry pack tightly in hot, 
dry glass jars. Seal closely to ex- 
clude the air, and store in a dry place.

Candy Making should be taught 
and acquired as one of the most use- 
ful of womanly accomplishments. 
Like every other art that calls for 
skill and intelligence, it has an edu- 
cational value. And the universal 
fondness for sweets renders the 
candy maker a popular favorite. 
Thus the mother who can make good 
candy and is fond of practicing her 
skill, or teaches and encourages her 
daughters to do so, will not only 
make her home attractive to her own 
family, but will also acquire an en- 
viable reputation as an entertainer. 
Then, too, there is a good market in 
all parts of the country for first class 
homemade candies. Even in cities 
where the large confectioners' shops 
seem capable of suppljing every de- 
mand, good homemade candies are 
given preference at the highest 
prices; while in small towns and rural 
districts, where cheap candles are 
the rule, the homemade article, if 
of good quality, will always find a 
ready sale. Children may offer a few 
pounds of homemade candies for sale 
at a small booth or table placed, in 
summer weather, on the lawn, and 
in many localities can thus earn a 
good many dollars from passers-by. 
Or after a reputation for the quality 



508 



of the product has been acquired, 
orders may be obtained from local 
merchants or from neighbors. When 
any considerable amount of candy is 
made, the best materials will not cost 
over 15 cents a pound, and prices 
ranging from 50 cents to $1 a pound 
are the rule for a high grade domestic 
article. A candy booth, always pro- 
viding the contents are of the best 
quality, is usually one of the most 
profitable features at church fairs, 
lawn parties, and other entertain- 
ments for the purpose of raising 
money. 

Utensils for Candy Making. — The 
entire outfit of a professional candy 
maker can be aft'orded by any one. 
First in order is a suitable surface 
on which to pour and work fondant 
and other candies. A flat or shal- 
low box or tray, 3 or 4 inches deep 
and of any convenient size, lined with 
tin or zinc, is used by many confec- 
tioners. But a marble slab, such 
as the top of an old-fashioned center 
table or bureau, is ideal for this pur- 
pose. It should be used wrong side 
up. A couple of candy scrapers or 
toy hoes like garden hoes are needed 
to work cream candy. Or have a car- 
penter make a spatula or flat scoop 
of hard wood, l!3 or 15 inches long, 



CANDIES AND CANDY-MAKING

shaped like a snow shovel, but having 
a very thin beveled edge, as shown in 
the illustration. This is used to lift 
and scrape the fondant. A good 
granite or porcelain double boiler, a 
broad, thin-bladed palette knife, a 
quantity of waxed paper, a two-tined 
fork with which to dip creams and 
bonbons; these complete the neces- 
sary outfit. A good pair of scales, a 
suitable measuring cup or graduated 
glass should be at hand in the kitch- 
en. And a small stock of fancy 
molds or starch prints will be found 
convenient. 

Ingredients for Candy. — These are 
of three sorts: sugar, fruit, nuts and 
the like, perfume or flavoring, and 
coloring matter. As to sugar, that 
known as Confectioners' XXX is the 
best and is used by confectioners for 
the finest grades of uncooked can- 
dies. Confectioners' " A " sugar is 
not as good, but is sometimes used 
for cooked candies. Pure granulated 
or loaf sugar properly clarified, forms 
a satisfactory substitute. But if 
adulterated sugar is used it will not 
be possible to get satisfactory re- 
sults. The ordinary powdered sugar 
sold by grocers is not usually prop- 
erly refined, and in many cases is 
adulterated. If the scum which rises 
is dirty or if the melted sirup has a 
brownish or purplish tinge, it is not 
fit for the finest grades of candy. 
And even the best granulated sugar 
or ordinary powdered sugar is not 
suitable for uncooked candies. Hence, 
if you expect to make candy for 
sale or are ambitious to secure the 
best results, ask your grocer to make 
a special order for Confectioners' 
XXX sugar, which can be procured of 
any large dealer in candy or whole- 
sale grocery house at a slightly high- 
er price than ordinary powdered 
sugar, and use this for uncooked 
fondant, icing, and the better grades 
of creams and bonbons. 

White sugar must be used for all 
light-colored candies. But coflPee or 
dark-brown sugar may be used for 
caramel, dark-colored nut candies, 
talfy or molasses candy that is to be 
pulled; or for any candy that is to 
be colored in dark shades. 

Measurements for Candy. — One 



pint Confectioners' " A " sugar. Con- 
fectioners' XXX or " powdered " su- 
gar equals | of a pound. 

One teacup or tumbler equals i 
a pound. 

One pint of brown sugar equals 14 
or 15 ounces; 1 teacup of brown su- 
gar equals about 9 or 10 ounces. 

Two tablespoonfuls equal 1 ounce, 
or 32 tablespoonfuls 1 pound. 

These measures are approximate, 
but are sufficiently accurate for prac- 
tical purposes. 

KINDS OF CANDIES 

Among the many sorts of candy 
turned out by professional confec- 
tioners, certain standard makes or 
kinds may be noted which admit of a 
general descrii:)tion. One important 
distinction is between the cooked 
candies, the basis of which is the clari- 
fied sirup boiled to the required 
degree, and the uncooked can- 
dies. 

The secret of uncooked candy con- 
sists in using Confectioners' XXX or 
other very finely powdered sugar. 
Ordinary powdered sugar is not suit- 
able for this purpose, as it will be 
found if tested between the thumb 
and finger to have a rough grain, 
whereas the Confectioners' XXX su- 
gar is as fine as starch. Uncooked 
candies may be made equal to the 
finest French cream. They should be 
allowed to stand twentj^-four hours 
or more before eaten. 

Among the standard sorts of 
cooked candies are fondant or cream, 
which may be clarified sirup boiled 
to the soft-ball degree and creamed 
by dipping or working with a 
wooden spoon or paddle, or by beat- 
ing up Confectioners' XXX sugar 
with white of egg and water or milk. 
These fondants are the foundation of 
chocolate and other cream candies, 
and many others. 

Bonbon is a general name for 
fancy candies, the heart or center of 
which may be made of nuts, fruits, 
or any sort of sweetmeats, and af- 
terwards dipped in melted fondant 
either of plain white sugar sirup, or 
sirup containing chocolate, coffee, or 
other flavoring matter, and tinted

with various coloring matters accord- 
ing to taste. 

Creams and cream candies are 
made of simple fondant with the 
addition of nuts, fruits, or sweet- 
meats stirred in, or having the fon- 
dant poured over them, or other- 
wise. 

Molasses Candy consists of mo- 
lasses in place of sugar sirup boiled 
down with or without a mixture of 
sugar or glucose. 

Butter-scotch and Taffy may con- 
sist of either molasses or sugar sirup 
with the addition of butter and fla- 
voring matter. 

Pastils or Drop Candy usually con- 
sist of simple clarified sirup with a 
small quantity of water and flavor- 
ing extract. 

Kisses and Marshraallows are sim- 
ple sirup beaten up with the white of 
egg or gum arabic. 

Fruit and Nut candies are mixtures 
of various sweetmeats with simple 
fondant. 

Macaroons and Ratafias consist of 
almonds beaten up with simple sirup 
and white of egg. 

Pralines or candied almonds are 
blanched almonds coated by immer- 
sion in boiling sirup. 

Candied Fruit and other sweet- 
meats are made by pouring over 
them the clarified sirup boiled to the 
feather degree. This is afterwards 
withdrawn, leaving the sweetmeats 
coated with sugar in a form which 
crystallizes after a while. 

Caramels are made of hard-baked 
candy with the addition of vari- 
ous sweetmeats and flavoring ex- 
tracts. 

Degrees for Kinds of Candy. — 
The following are general rules as to 
the state or degree of sugar boiling 
best adapted to the difterent sorts of 
candy, but these may be varied more 
or less by particular recipes which 
should, of course, be carefully ob- 
served : 

Ordinary Fondant or French Cream 
is boiled to the soft ball. 

Sugar, Cream, or Molasses Candy 
for a " candy pull " to the snap or 
crack. 

Taffy and Butter-scotch the same. 

Pastils or Drop Candy. — Boil as 



little as possible; the candy should 
merely be dissolved. 

Kisses, Marshmallows, and Maca- 
roons are not boiled (except French 
kisses, which are boiled to the 
thread), but are beaten up with 
white of egg and browned in a bak- 
ing oven. 

Sirup for Candied Sweetmeats 
boiled to the feather or flake. 

Pralines boiled to the pearl. 

Caramels boiled to the caramel or 
hard-baked degree. 

BOILING SIRUP FOR CANDY 

To Clarify Sugar. — To make good 
candy it is first advisable to clarify 
the sugar by boiling it to a thin sirup 
with half its own bulk or more of 
water and the addition of the white 
of egg, gum arabic, or gelatin. This 
precaution will cause the impurities 
to rise in a scum, which may be re- 
moved with a skimmer. The result- 
ing clarified sirup is the basis of all 
high-grade candies. 

Similarly to clarify brown or yel- 
low sugar, add white of egg or a so- 
lution of gelatin, isinglass, or gum 
arabic with water, and boil until the 
impurities rise to the surface. Dis- 
solve 4 cupfuls of sugar in 1 of warm 
water and add the white of 1 egg 
beaten up with 1 cupful of cold 
water. Boil with gentle heat, re- 
moving the scum as fast as it ap- 
pears. 

Or dissolve 4 cupfuls of sugar in 1 
cupful of warm water; simmer with 
gentle heat, and add * ounce of gum 
arabic dissolved in a little boiling 
water. Remove the scum with a 
skimmer as fast as it appears. 

For white sugars, less of the white 
of egg is required, but the same 
quantity of water should be used. 

To clarify loaf sugar, 1 white of 
egg to every 6 pounds of sugar is all 
that will be required. But add, when 
boiling loaf sugar, 1 tablcspoonful of 
lemon juice or vinegar to prevent it 
from graining. As the sirup boils, 
add a little cold water to prevent it 
boiling over, and skim as the froth 
subsides. Do this three or four 
times, and strain the whole through 
cheese cloth. Add flavoring matter,

if desired, after the purified sugar 
lias been removed from the fire. 

To Clarify Molasses. — To make a 
fine grade of molasses candy or to 
purify molasses so that it may be 
used in place of sugar for candies, 
cooking, and other purposes, take 
equal parts of molasses and water, 
and i part of coarse broken char- 
coal; as, 24 pounds of molasses, 24 
pounds of water, and 6 pounds of 
charcoal. Mix and boil for half an 
hour over a slow fire. Pour into a 
large flat pan or vat and let stand 
until the charcoal settles to the bot- 
tom. Strain off the clear molasses 
through a piece of cheese cloth and 
simmer with gentle heat until the 
water is all evaporated and the mo- 
lasses has returned to its proper con- 
sistency. Molasses will lose nothing 
in bulk by this process, as 24 pounds 
of molasses will give 24 pounds of 
clarified sirup, from which the finer 
grades of molasses candy can be 
made. 

To Clarify Maple Sugar. — To 
weigh, melt, and clarify maple sugar, 
break up the cakes and add enough 
water according to the condition of 
the sugar — whether hard or soft 
grain — to dissolve. Place over a 
slow fire and stir while melting. If 
the sugar was of a soft grain, add 15 
pounds of granulated sugar. Or, if 
a hard grain, add 15 pounds of best 
light coffee sugar. Boil to a medium 
ball. Test by pouring a little in a 
porcelain-lined saucepan until the 
grain is cloudy. Leave a little of the 
grained sirup in the saucepan from 
the last stirring to make the next 
grain quicker. Pour in buttered 
molds, or set the kettle into a tub of 
ice water to cool and harden. But 
observe that maple sugar thus mixed 
with cane sugar must not be offered 
for sale without a statement of the 
face that it has been thus treated. 

To Boil or to Candy Sugar. — The 
art of candy making is very ancient, 
and the process of boiling sugar for 
candy has been observed and studied 
for many generations. Thus it has 
been observed that the clarified sirup, 
as it gradually loses moisture by 
evaporation in the course of boiling 
down, assumes certain stages in which 



it is best adapted for use in making 
different kinds of candies. For con- 
venience in preparing recipes these 
stages have been named and carefully 
defined, so that with a little attention 
they may be noted by any one. When 
once observed they will always be 
recognized at a glance, and the proc- 
ess of candy making will become al- 
most as easy for the amateur as it 
is for the professional confectioner. 

Seven different states or degrees 
are noted, three of which fall into 
two different stages. These are call- 
ed respectively (1) the lisse or the 
thread, which may be large or small; 
(2) the perle or pearl, either large 
or small; (3) the souffle or the blow; 
(4) the plume or feather; (5) the 
boulet or ball, large or small; (6) the 
casse or the crack or snap; and (7) 
the caramel or hard baked. 

To Test Sirup. — The method prac- 
ticed by professional confectioners to 
test the state or " degree " of boil- 
ing sirup is to dip the tip of the 
forefinger and thumb of the right 
hand into iced water, then into the 
boiling sirup, and quickly back into 
the iced water again. The operation 
is much like that of testing a hot flat- 
iron with a wet finger. If the test is 
made quickly enough, the ice water 
will prevent the hot sirup from burn- 
ing the fingers. There is, of course, 
a knack in doing this, but with a lit- 
tle practice it can be readily ac- 
quired. The thumb and forefinger 
are brought together in the iced wa- 
ter, to prevent the sirup from run- 
ning off, and quickly withdrawn, 
holding a pinch of sirup between 
the forefinger and the thumb. By 
spreading them, the state or degree 
of the boiling sirup can be ascer- 
tained. 

Another method of testing, which 
may perhaps be preferred by the be- 
ginner in candy making, is to take 
out a little of the sirup with a sj)Oon, 
lower it in a cup of cold water, and 
let a drop fall from the edge on the 
tip of the forefinger. 

Or, to dip the forefinger and 
thumb in iced water, take out a little 
of the hot sirup on a small stick or 
skewer, and test a drop between the 
thumb and finger. 



51» 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Candies that are to be pulled may 
be tested by pouring a spoonful of 
sirup into cold water and observing 
if it is brittle enough to break with- 
out bending, like a pipesteui, other- 
wise the boiling must be continued. 

THE SEVEN DEGREES 

To make the experiment of noting 
the seven degrees in sugar boiling, 
crush 1 pound of fine loaf sugar, add 
3 gills of water and put it on or boil 
in a clean saucepan over a sharp fire. 
Have at hand a bowl full of iced wa- 
ter, a suitable skimmer and if desired 
a small stick or skewer. Remove the 
scum as fast as it rises to the surface, 
and after about 2 minutes by the 
watch make the first test as above 
suggested either by dipping the 
thumb and forefinger, first into the 
iced water, then into the boiling 
sugar, and back into the iced water 
again, or by means of a spoon or 
skewer. Take great care that the 
sirup does not boil over, and stir fre- 
quently so that it may not burn. 

TheLisse or Thread. — If on sepa- 
rating the thumb and forefinger with 
a pinch of sirup between them, a 
thin, short thread is formed which 
quickly snaps, the sugar is in the 
state known as the " small thread." 
In a few seconds more, when the 
thread can be drawn out to double 
its former length without snapping, 
its state is known as the " large 
thread." 

The Perle or Pearl. — After another 
minute or two longer, the sugar in 
boiling will form small round bub- 
bles or globules that look like large 
pearls. This state is known as the 
" small pearl." Soon the pearls will 
cover the entire surface of the sirup, 
and this state is known as the " large 
pearl." In the pearl state a pinch of 
sirup may be drawn out to the full 
extension of the finger and thumb 
without breaking. This is the proper 
degree for most kinds of candy 
making. 

The Souffle or Blow. — After an- 
other minute or two, dip the skim- 
mer in the sirup and jar it sharply 
by striking it on the edge of the pan. 
Blow through the holes, and if the 



sirup forms small bubbles or globules 
on the reverse side, the sirup is in 
the state known as the " blow." 

The Plume or Feather. — Again dip 
in the skimmer, and shake it so as to 
flirt the sirup from the edges. If it 
threads and flies from the skimmer in 
flakes or hangs from the edge in 
strings it is in the state known as 
the " feather." 

The Boulet or Ball. — Make the 
next test with the thumb and finger, 
or by dropping a little sirup into 
cold water. If it can be rolled be- 
tween the finger and thumb into a 
soft, creamy, but not sticky ball, the 
state is known as the " soft ball." 
After a few seconds' more boiling, on 
testing in the same manner, it will be 
found to be in the state known as the 
"hard ball." 

The Casse or the Crack or Snap. — 
The next test is made with the thumb 
and finger, and if the pinch of sirup 
is brittle enough to crack or snap, 
leaving the parts attached to the 
thumb and finger dry and hard, it is 
in the state known as " crack." In 
this state it does not stick to the 
teeth, and a spoonful dropped into 
cold water will be hard and very brit- 
tle. This is the state in which candy 
is ready to be pulled. 

The Caramel or Hard Baked. — 
When the sirup begins to brown, it 
is in the state known as " caramel " 
or "hard baked." It will then give 
off a pungent odor and brown rap- 
idly, when it must be at once re- 
moved from the fire, as otherwise it 
will burn to a black cinder. 

In this state, if a little sirup is 
dropped into cold water it will 
crackle and snap like glass. Care 
must always be taken not to allow 
the fire to burn up against the sides 
of the saucepan, or the sugar may be 
burned and discolored. 

The above are the definitions of the 
different degrees in sugar boiling 
noted by French confectioners, who 
are considered the best in the 
world. 

By others the distinctions between 
the little and great thread, the small 
and great pearl, and the soft and 
hard ball are less noted; the blow 
and the feather, or the feather and 



t\

the ball are often regarded as iden- 
tical. 

Sirup for Candied Sweetmeats. — 
Boil down clarified sirup to the feath- 
er degree, or 35 degrees by a sirup 
tester. Quickly remove the pan from 
the fire and set it into a dish of cold 
water, iced water, if possible, coming 
up all around the sides so as to cool it 
as quickly as possible. Lay over the 
top of tiie sugar a piece of waxed 
paper cut to fit the inside of the 
saucepan. When entirely cold, stir 
the sirup over the sweetmeats to be 
candied. A special utensil can be 
obtained for this purpose, having 
corrugated tubes at the bottom from 
which the sirup may be drained off. 

Or the sweetmeats may be placed 
in a small basket strainer and put 
in the sirup, which may be placed 
in an earthenware or other round-bot- 
tomed vessel slightly larger in 
size than the strainer. The whole 
should be covered tightly and placed 
in a refrigerator, cellar, or the cold- 
est place attainable. A temperature 
below the freezing point is desirable. 

After standing over night, or about 
eighteen hours in this temperature, 
the strainer containing sweetmeats 
should be lifted from the sirup 
(which should be drained off), and 
without being removed from the 
strainer should be placed in a clean 
vessel and allowed to dry and com- 
plete the crystallization. 

Sirup for Molds. — To prepare a 
sirup for lead molds or starch prints, 
boil together to the soft ball 2 cup- 
fuls of sugar, 1 large tablespoonful 
of glucose, i cupful of water. 

Or test by tangling a yard or more 
of fine wire in a mass of loops, dip 
this in the sirup, lift and blow 
through them, when, if the sirup is 
done, bubbles will be formed and the 
sirup will be feathery and fly off in 
flakes. Now pour on a moistened 
molding board or on a marble slab 
to cool. When lukewarm, cream 
with a wooden paddle and set away 
in an earthenware bowl covered 
with several folds of wet cloth. Let 
stand twenty-four hours or more be- 
fore using. To use this fondant set 
the required quantity in an earthen- 
ware bowl in a double boiler over a 



dying fire and stir constantly until 
melted. But do not let the fire burn 
up or the sirup approach the boiling 
point, as if it simmers or boils it will 
grain. At this stage add any desired 
flavoring or coloring matter. 

Sirup for Crystals. — Boil IJ 
pounds of sugar with i pint of water 
to the fine thread, for small crystals, 
or to the great thread for larger 
crystals. Remove from the fire and 
let stand until nearly cold. Sprinkle 
over the top a little water to dissolve 
the film which gathers on it. Lay the 
sweetmeats to be crj'stallized in shal- 
low pie tins inclined at a slight angle, 
and pour over them sirup from a 
ladle imtil they are covered. Lay on 
the top of the sweetmeats two or three 
folds of damp cloth, to prevent a 
crust from forming, and let stand un- 
til the sirup crystallizes, which may 
require several hours. Drain off the 
sirup, which may be done by laying 
on top of the cloth another pan of 
similar size to keep the candies in 
place, and tilting the vessel to let the 
sirup escape at the edge. Lay away 
the candies to dry, leaving the cloth 
over them, and sprinkling it with wa- 
ter until it is quite damp. The re- 
maining sirup may be preserved and 
used again for other sweetmeats. 

When the candies are dry, hold a 
cloth tightly to the edges of the pan, 
turn it upside down on a smooth sur- 
face, and the candies will drop out 
on the cloth. They may then be sepa- 
rated and wrapped in paper or 
boxed. They must be kept in a cool, 
dry place. 

CREAM OR FONDANT 

To prepare fondant or cream, 
which is the foundation of the justly 
celebrated French creams and bon- 
bons, the sirup must be removed from 
the fire at the soft-ball degree, or 
just before it is ready to produce 
taffy or hard candy. 

The sure way to determine the 
right state is by means of the sugar 
thermometer. The " soft ball " oc- 
curs at 238 degrees. The beginner 
who has mastered the art of making 
good cream or fondant is in posses- 
sion of the principal secret of profes-

sional candy making, and may turn 
his or her skill to good account by 
making saleable sweetmeats. There 
are, of course, many recipes for mak- 
ing fondant both with and without 
glucose. The latter makes a some- 
what cheaper candy, and if it is read- 
ily obtainable, ot good quality, its use 
in homemade candy is not objection- 
able. 

To Boil Fondant. — To prepare 
fondant in general, boil the sirup 
rapidly over a quick fire to the soft- 
ball degree. Do not stir the sirup 
while boiling, as this would cause it 
to grain. When a drop of the sirup 
cooled in cold water can be rolled 
into a soft creamy, but not sticky, 
ball it is done and should be removed 
immediately from the fire. If on 
rubbing a little of the sirup with 
a wooden spoon against the sides of 
the pan it seems soft and creamy it 
should be allowed to stand until luke- 
warm and then creamed, but if by 
chance it has been boiled too hard, 
add a little boiling water, return to 
the fire, and make a new test. 

Cautions on Making Fondant. — 
Never attempt to make fondant when 
the air is humid, as in rain or foggy 
weather, or when there is a high wind. 
Select a clear day with a cloudless 
sky and still air or a gentle breeze. 
Sirup tends to grain in windy 
weather, and fondant cannot be work- 
ed properly in wet weather, since the 
slightest moisture affects it. 

Do not add more moisture to the 
fondant in the form of flavoring mat- 
ter or otherwise than is absolutely 
neccessary. 

After mixing the sugar and water 
for fondant, stir until the sugar is 
thoroughly dissolved, but do not stir 
after it is placed on the stove to boil, 
otherwise the fondant will grain and 
it will be necessary to melt it over 
again. Do not be discouraged if you 
do not at first succeed. 

If the sirup grains or is too soft, 
add boiling water, stir until it is dis- 
solved, place it back on the stove and 
boil as before. This may be done a 
dozen times if necessary. Thus ex- 
periment with your first batch of 
fondant until you acquire the neces- 
sary skill or knack. After that the 



art of candy making will come more 
easily. 

Oil slightly with pure olive oil the 
marble slab, or other surface on 
which you work. But use as little 
oil as possible. 

Do not let the fondant become too 
cold or hard before commencing to 
work it. Pour it out on the slab in a 
rather thin layer so that it will settle 
in uniform thickness. As soon as it 
hardens enough on the edges to be 
lifted and rolled, commence to work 
from the edges in toward the center 
of the mass. Do not give the fondant 
time to harden, but work very brisk- 
ly, turning the edges in with the 
scraper or spatula, or working the 
hoes back and forth until the whole 
gathers into a solid mass which can- 
not be readily divided. Then knead 
with the hands like bread. Work 
hard until the fondant acquires the 
proper consistcncj-. 

Store fondant in tightly sealed 
glass fruit jars. Thus it may be 
kept indefinitely. Or to keep it for 
a few days only, place in an earthen- 
ware bowl and cover with two or 
three layers of cloths wrung out so 
as to be moist but not wet. 

Let fondant stand twenty-four 
hours or more before making centers 
for creams or bonbons and let the 
centers themselves stand for twenty-^ 
four hours or more before dipping. 
Otherwise thej' will be melted when 
dipping into the hot chocolate or 
other fondant. Again, let the candies 
stand a day or two to set before they 
are packed for use or sale. 

Do not use more coloring or flavor- 
ing matter than is necessary — just 
enough so that the tint or flavor can 
be readily distinguished, is a good 
rule. Do not add flavoring matter to 
fondant until it has been removed 
from the fire and is nearly cool. 
Sprinkle the flavoring over the sur- 
face in the process of creaming and 
it will be thoroughly worked into the 
mass by kncadintr. 

To Roll Fondant. — Cut off as 
many pounds of fondant, at least 
24 hours old, as you need to make 
candy. Measure * teaspoonful of 
flavoring extract or less to each 
pound of candy and add to the fla- 



CANDIES AND CANDY-MAKING 



515 



voring extract 1 drop of the ap- 
propriate coloring matter. Roll the 
fondant out thin on the shib, .s])rinkle 
the coloring matter over it and thor- 
oughly incorporate it by kneading, 
the same as when working over 
bread. Have ready prepared sheets 
of waxed paper. And have at hand 
nuts, fruit, or decorations for the 
candies you are about to make. Cut 
the fondant into small pieces and roll 
into the desired shajje with the fin- 
gers or palms. If fruit or nuts are 
to be used, add them at once while 
the cream is moist. Or if the centers 
are to be dipped, set them in order 
on waxed paper and let stand twenty- 
four hours more to harden. 

To Dip Fondant. — If the chocolate 
for dipping fondants becomes too 
thick, add to it a little cocoanut oil. 
This is the natural oil of chocolate, 
and is, hence, the most appropriate 
substance with which to thin it. Do 
not attempt to thin it with hot water, 
as it will immediately cause the 
chocolate to grain. 

Or use fresh, unsalted butter or 
olive oil. To dip the centers, use a 
slender two-tined fork, turn the coni- 
cal point of the chocolate to the 
right, downward, dip under in a half 
circle, remove it point first and hold 
it upright over the chocolate for a 
moment or two to drip. Then set it 
down gently on the waxed paper. 
Add nuts, fruit, or decorations, if 
any, while the chocolate is still damp. 
Dip bonbons in the same manner. 

To Cream Fondant. — When the 
sirup is done set it away from the 
fire and let it stand until about luke- 
warm. Now commence to stir with a 
wooden paddle. Commence to stir 
round and round, always in the same 
direction; keep the sirup away from 
the sides of the kettle so that it will 
not grain or form in lumps. Pres- 
ently the edges will commence to 
show white and dry. The mass must 
now be laid on a marble slab or a 
kneading board, which may be dusted 
with fine flour, cornstarch, or Con- 
fectioners' XXX sugar, and kneaded 
with the hands in the same manner 
as bread dough until it is of a uni- 
form soft and creamy consistency. 

Place the mass of fondant if not re- 



quired for use in an earthenware 
bowl and cover it with several folds 
of a cloth wrung out so as to be moist 
but not wet. It may thus be kept for 
a number of days, and will only re- 
quire to be warmed at the fire or by 
setting the bowl in a vessel of boiling 
water or on a hot soapstone, or on 
two or three common bricks pre- 
viously heated in the oven, to be 
ready for immediate use. Any rem- 
nant of the fondant which becomes 
hard and dry, or a batch of fondant 
which has been cooked too much, 
may be softened with hot water and 
reboiled to the proper degree. 

Confectioner's Fondant. — The fol- 
lowing recipe is that of a profes- 
sional confectioner, and the full 
quantities are given for the benefit 
of dealers in candy, grocers, or per- 
sons desiring to make candy in large 
quantities for sale at a fair, church 
bazaar, or otherwise. The quantity 
of candy here described will require a 
large kneading board or vat with low 
sides; but any smooth surface, as a 
clean kitchen table, will answer. As 
the mass will be too large to be 
worked with the hands it is better to 
take a small garden hoe with a short 
handle, which should, of course, be 
scoured clean for the purpose. 

Boil down -20 pounds of fine granu- 
lated sugar with 2i quarts of water 
to the stift' boil. Remove from the 
fire and sprinkle on top 6 pounds of 
glucose, but do not stir it in. Set 
back on the fire and let it boil until 
the scum boils in. 

Note that the glucose must not be 
added until the sugar is boiled to the 
hard ball, and must not be stirred, 
but allowed to boil in of itself. Dust 
the vat or molding board with Con- 
fectioners' XXX sugar, pour out the 
mass on this as soon as the scum has 
boiled in, and let it cool until you can 
lay your hand on it. But it is better 
to begin a little sooner than to let 
it get too cold. Take two short gar- 
den hoes or cream scrapers, work it 
flat and sprinkle over it rather less 
than i pint of glycerin. Cream thor- 
oughly with the hoes or scrapers, and 
let stand over night before using. 

When this fondant is first made it 
will be rather rough and coarse in

texture, but standing twelve hours or 
more will give it a uniform fine tex- 
ture and it improves with age, never 
graining or turning stale. If this 
recipe is carefully followed, a fine 
quality of cream for chocolate drops, 
cream candies, and other fondants 
can be made at a very satisfactory 
profit. 

Fondant without Glucose. — Boil 
rapidly over a quick fire to the soft- 
ball degree 6 cupfuls of fine granu- 
lated sugar, 2 cupfuls of water, and 
^ teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 

Or 3 pounds of granulated sugar, 
1 pint of water, and i teaspoonful 
of cream of tartar. The addition of 
cream of tartar prevents the sirup 
from graining. Remove from the fire 
as soon as done, let the mass cool 
until lukewarm, and proceed as be- 
fore. 

Chocolate Fondant. — Instead of 
pure melted chocolate, a fondant con- 
taining 2 tablespoonfuls of grated 
chocolate to each pound of cream 
may be used. Place in a bowl, set in 
a vessel of hot water, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of chocolate and when melted 
add a cupful of clarified sirup and 1 
pound of melted fondant. Stir and 
mix well. In this chocolate fondant 
dip the hearts or centers of creams 
or bonbons by transfixing them with 
a fork or hatpin and dropping them 
on waxed or liuttered paper or sheets 
of tin to harden. Fruits, as cherries, 
figs, and the like, are very delicious 
coated in this way, or mixed nuts 
dipped and rolled with French cream 
and thus coated are also excellent. 

Bonbon Fondant. — Prepare any 
ordinary fondant, but cream it with 
a wooden paddle, and do not knead it 
as for ordinary fondant. Let it stand 
twenty-four hours or more in an 
earthenware bowl covered with sev- 
eral thicknesses of wet cloth. To dip 
bonbons heat the fondant by setting 
it on a soapstone or in a pan of hot 
water over the stove and stirring 
constantly, but do not allow it to boil. 
A double boiler may be used for this 
purpose. Dip the centers by trans- 
fixing them with a fork or hatpin, 
and set them to cool on sheets of 
waxed paper. This recipe is suitable 
for all sorts of nuts, fruits, and other 



sweetmeat centers. The fondant may 
be tinted or colored as desired. 

Uncooked Fondant. — Beat up the 
white of egg and mix with the same 
amount of water by bulk in an earth- 
enware bowl. Whip in Confection- 
ers' XXX sugar to a stiff paste, which 
will stand when molded with the 
fingers to any desired shape. Flavor 
and tint as desired. After molding 
let the pieces stand several hours to 
harden, but make up no more fon- 
dant than is required for immediate 
use, as it soon hardens. This fon- 
dant may be used as centers for 
chocolate creams, or for nut or fruit 
sweetmeats in place of any of the 
cooked fondants as desired. 

CREAM CANDIES 

Chocolate Creams. — Mold French 
cream or any of the fondants into 
cone-shaped balls with the hands or 
fingers. Let them stand over night on 
waxed paper or a marble slab, or 
until they are thoroughly hardened. 
If they are allowed to stand twenty- 
four hours or more all the better. 

Coating for Chocolate Creams. — 
Melt a cake of chocolate in a double 
boiler, but do not let it boil. When 
melted add a lump of paraflSn as big 
as a small walnut, half as much but- 
ter, and a few drops of vanilla. 

Or melt in a double boiler a piece 
of paraffin the size of a hickory nut, 
a teaspoonful of lard, and add i 
pound of chocolate. Stir until melt- 
ed. If a thicker coat of chocolate is 
desired, add to the melted chocolate 
to thicken it a little glycerin or a few 
drops of linseed oil. 

Do not attempt to thin dipping 
chocolate with water or else it will 
immediately grain and harden. 

To Coat Chocolate Creams. — Place 
the pan of melted chocolate in a 
larger pan of boiling water on a very 
hot soapstone. This keeps the choco- 
late melted. Place the creams on 
waxed paper at the left, and a sheet 
of waxed paper to receive the coated 
chocolates at the right. Take up the 
creams by thrusting them through 
with a fork or a hatpin, dip them 
quickly in the chocolate, and slip 
them off on the waxed paper.

Or, holding the cream on a fork or 
hatpin, pour the melted chocolate 
over them from a teaspoon. Let the 
creams stand twenty-four hours or 
more to harden. 

Chocolate-cream Candy. — Melt to- 
gether in a double boiler 4 ounce of 
chocolate scraped fine, 3 ounces of 
powdered loaf sugar, 1 pint of sweet 
cream. Bring these nearly to a boil 
but remove before they simmer and 
beat them up with an egg beater. 
Let cool, adding the whites of 4 or 5 
eggs. Again beat up the whole with 
an egg beater, remove the froth with 
a sieve, and serve in glasses deco- 
rated with the froth on top. 

Or dissolve in 6 glasses of fresh 
milk 1 ounce of grated chocolate 
and 3 ounces of white sugar. Beat 
up the yolks of 3 eggs and stir into 
these the milk and chocolate, stirring 
slowly one way. Add a few drops of 
vanila boiled with milk. Mix well, 
place in cups in a pan of water, and 
boil for an hour. Serve cold. 

French Cream. — Place in a clean 
saucepan 2 cupfuls of white sugar, i 
cupful of hot water. Boil 8 min- 
utes without stirring. When done it 
should fall in threads from the stir- 
rer, and when rubbed against the 
side of the pan should be of a creamy 
consistency. A few drops in cold 
water should roll into a soft ball be- 
tween the fingers. 

It is better to remove from the fire 
too soon than to cook too much, as if 
necessary it can be returned to the 
fire and the cooking continued. 

When done pour into a bowl and 
beat with an egg beater. When cool 
add any desired flavoring matter. 
This is a fondant which may be 
molded or cut into any desired shape, 
tinted and colored as desired, or 
made into bonbons by molding into 
various shapes and decorating with 
almonds or other nuts pressed into 
the top or side. Place the pan con- 
taining the cream in hot water or on 
a warm soapstone while molding it to 
prevent its getting too cold. 

Or place in a clean saucepan 9 
cupfuls of granulated sugar, i cup- 
ful of milk. Bring to a boil over 
a slow fire and boil for 5 minutes. 
Remove and set the saucepan in a 



pan of cold water. Beat up with an 
egg beater until it creams. Mold into 
balls with the hands, and arrange in 
layers with figs, dates, or nuts be- 
tween, and cut into squares. 

Or mold into any desired shape 
and place the nuts on top. This 
is suitable fondant for chocolate 
creams. 

French Cream, with Glucose. — 
Pour over 2 tablespoonfuls of glu- 
cose § cupful of boiling water. Stir 
in Confectioners' XXX sugar to 
make a stiff paste. After standing 
half an hour knead thoroughly with 
the hands. Color and flavor to taste. 

French Vanilla Cream. — Take the 
whites of any desired number of 
eggs and an equal quantity of cold 
water or milk. Stir in Confectioners' 
XXX sugar to make a stiff paste, 
tint and flavor to taste. Form in 
fancy shapes and place on waxed pa- 
per to dry. This is suitable fondant 
for all bonbons and chocolate drops. 
About li pounds of confectioners' 
sugar will be required for the Tvhite 
of 1 egg. 

Cream Candy. — Boil together to 
the hard snap 1 pound of white su- 
gar, 1 cupful of water, i teaspoon- 
ful of cream of tartar, 2 teaspoonfuls 
of best white vinegar, 2 teaspoonfuls 
of vanila, butter the size of an egg. 
When it hardens on being di'opped 
in water pour into a buttered pan 
and when nearly cold pull. 

Or boil to the hard snap, or about 
half an hour over a slow fire, 3 
pounds of loaf sugar, * pint of water, 
add 1 teaspoonful of fine pickled gum 
arable dissolved in 2 tablespoonfuls 
of boiling water and 1 tablespoon- 
ful of vinegar. Boil until it hardens 
on being dropped in water, remove 
and flavor as desired. Rub the hands 
with unsalted butter and pull until 
the candy is white. Twist or break 
it, stretch into ribbons, cut to any 
desired size, and lay on buttered 
plates or waxed paper to harden. 

Maple Creams. — Beat up together 
with an egg beater or otherwise the 
white of 1 egg and 1 cup of pure 
maple sirup. Stir in Confectioners' 
XXX sugar to make a stiff paste, 
mold to any desired shape, and coat 
with chocolate or fondant.

Or boil to the soft-ball state 1 
pound of maple sugar with i tea- 
spoonful of cream of tartar and i 
cup of water. Let stand in the 
saucepan until nearly cold, and stir 
until it clouds or becomes creamy. 
Pour into a shallow tin greased with 
oil of sweet almonds or unsalted but- 
ter to cool. When cold cut to any 
desired shape. 

Or mix grated maple sugar with 
French cream, and stir in dry con- 
fectioners' sugar to make a stiff 
paste. 

Peppermint Creams. — Flavor 
French cream freely with essence of 
peppermint and shape into round, 
flat creams. 

Wintergreen Creams. — Flavor 
French cream freely with winter- 
green essence and color pink. Shape 
into round, flat forms or mold as de- 
sired. 

Neapolitan Creams. — Divide 
French cream into a number of parts. 
Tint and flavor these differently, and 
arrange on waxed paper or a marble 
slab in the same fashion as layer 
cake or marble cake. Roll out the 
mass with a rolling pin or by pres- 
sure with the hand to any desired 
thickness, and the parts will be found 
to keep their relative positions. Cut 
to any desired shape. 

FRUIT AND NUT CREAMS 

Fruit Creams. — Chop up any de- 
sired fruit as citron, currants, figs, 
or seedless raisins very fine and mix 
with French cream while the sugar is 
being stirred in. Roll the mass on a 
suitable slab with a rolling pin, and 
cut or mold to any desired shape. 

Fig Creams. — Quarter small figs 
with a sharp knife so as to leave the 
quarters connected at the stem. Col- 
or and flavor French cream or fon- 
dant as desired, roll flat, cut into 
strips of the thickness of the little 
finger, cut off pieces somewhat short- 
er than the fig and place one in each 
fig, closing the quarters about it. 
Dip the whole in French cream or 
fondant. 

Or cut dry figs in strips and wrap 
the inner seed side around a piece of 
fondant. Cut to any desired shape. 



Chop any desired nut of mixture of 
nuts very fine, and stir with the sugar 
into French cream. Mold to fancy 
shapes and tint or flavor as desired. 

Date Creams. — Remove the pits 
from the dates, split open the end, 
insert a ball of cream with a clove 
stuck in the end. 

Almond Creams. — Chop the alm- 
onds fine and stir with the sugar 
into French cream, or mold the 
French cream to fancy shapes and 
press the almond meat into the side. 

English Walnut Creams. — Mold 
French cream in any desired size and 
place half an English walnut meat 
on the top or on either side. 

Walnut Creams. — Boil to the hard 
snap stage 1 cupful of grated choco- 
late, 1 cupful of brown sugar, 1 cup- 
ful of molasses, i cupful of sweet 
milk. When it hardens on being 
dropped in water stir in butter the 
size of an egg, 1 cupful of chopped 
walnuts, or add, in place cf milk, 
pure cream. 

Or boil together to the hard snap 
4 cupfuls of granulated sugar, 3 
tablespoonfuls of glucose, 1 cupful of 
boiling water. Now add a cupful of 
cream, i cupful of butter, and stir 
until done; before removing from the 
fire add 3 cupfuls of finely chopped 
hickory nuts, stir thoroughly, and 
pour out to cool. Other nut cara- 
mels can be prepared from the same 
recipe. 

BONBONS 

To prepare bonbons it is necessary 
to have suitable lead molds oiled with 
the oil of sweet almonds, or starch 
prints of various shapes and sizes. 
These are filled by means of a suit- 
able funnel with sirup in the state 
known as the blow. 

To test the sugar, dip the skimmer, 
strike it against the sides of the pan, 
and blow through the holes. If small 
bubbles and gleams of light may be 
seen, it is in the right condition. Add 
a few drops of an_v desired flavoring 
matter, and if coloring matter is de- 
sired add the color just as the sugar 
is taken from the fire. If the bon- 
bons are to be white, let the sugar 
cool a little, and stir it in the pan 



CANDIES AND CANDY-MAKING

until it grains and shines on the sur- 
face. 

Allow the molds to cool, and let 
stand two or three days. As soon as 
the molds are cold remove the bon- 
bons on waxed paper, and let stand 
two or thi-ee days to dry. 

Chocolate and Vanilla Cream Bon- 
bons. — Strain through a piece of 
muslin 1 ounce of fine picked gum 
arable, soaked in i gill of hot water. 
Add a few drops essence of vanilla, 
and stir in as much icing sugar as 
it will take, working it into a stiff 
but soft and yielding paste. About 
1 pound of sugar will be required. 
Dissolve 2 ounces of French choco- 
late with a tablespoonful of water in 
an oven. Beat up the mixture, and 
work smooth, and add to it the white 
of 1 egg beaten as for icing. 

Mold suitable drops of vanilla 
cream fondant; place these on a 
sheet of waxed paper or plain paper 
brushed with fine sugar, and let 
stand until hard. Dip these creams 
in the chocolate coating in the usual 
way. 

Almond Bonbons. — Mold almond 
paste into any desired shape, and dip 
them into melted fondant. 

Cocoanut Marshmallow Bonbons. — 
Cut fresh marshmellows into quar- 
ters or any desired shape, dip in 
melted fondant, roll in grated cocoa- 
nut, and set on waxed paper to hard- 
en. The fondant may be of various 
tints and flavors for variety. Use if 
possible fresh coarsely grated cocoa- 
nut, as if too fine it will not adhere 
well to the fondant. Or desiccated 
cocoanut may be used, if necessary, 
but is not equally good. 

Cocoanut Maple Bonbons. — Grate 
fine 1 fresh cocoanut and stir it into 
a pound of soft maple cream or fon- 
dant. Mix the mass with the hands 
until thoroughly incorporated. Roll 
and cut out with a small candy cut- 
ter, roll into round balls with the 
palms, let stand to harden slightly, 
and dip in cream fondant or choco- 
late as preferred. 

Cocoanut Strawberry Bonbons. — 
To 1 freshly grated cocoanut add 
about four times as much, by bulk, 
stiff fondant, mix thoroughly with 
the hands, and mold into conical 



shapes the size of strawberries. 
When dry dip into melted fondant 
flavored with strawberry and tinted 
pink. Afterwards roll in red sugar 
sand. 

Maple Bonbons. — Use maple sugar 
instead of granulated to make a 
cream or fondant in the usual man- 
ner. 

Or use part maple sugar and part 
granulated sugar. Form this fon- 
dant, when of a soft and creamy con- 
sistency, into any desired shape, let 
stand to harden, dip in melted cream 
or fondant, and place on waxed pa- 
per to harden. 

Jelly Cream Bonbons. — Obtain a 
starch tray having molds with two 
sections, one smaller than the other. 
Cook a suitable quantity of apple 
jelly to a stiff consistency, and with 
this by means of a funnel fill one half 
of the mold. Let cool and fill the re- 
mainder of the mold with the melted 
fondant of the consistency of ordi- 
nary cream. A variety of different 
tints and flavors and molds of differ- 
ent shapes and sizes may be used to 
produce different effects. 

Pineapple Bonbons. — Dip in melt- 
ed fondant pineapples cut into fancy 
shapes and place on waxed paper to 
harden. 

Walnut Bonbons. — Mix equal parts 
of chopped black walnuts with a soft 
fondant, mold to any desired shape, 
dip in chocolate, maple or cream fon- 
dant and arrange on waxed paper to 
harden. 



TAFFY AND MOLASSES CANDY 
FOR CANDY PULLS 

Taffy is a simple candy, which may 
be made of either granulated, light 
or dark-brown sugar or molasses. 
Or both sugar and molasses, with 
the addition of butter and vinegar, 
lemon juice or other flavoring sub- 
stance, as desired. 

The ingredients may be boiled to- 
gether, or the butter may be added 
when the sirup is nearly done. Lemon 
juice or other flavoring matter should 
not be added until the boiling is 
nearly finished, as otherwise the fla- 
vor will be partly lost. Taffy is a 
good candy for children to make, as 



5S0 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



it is simple and easily handled. It 
may also be worked into various de- 
signs, twisted, braided, formed into 
horseshoes, baskets, and the like. 
Two or more strands of different col- 
ors may be braided together. Bas- 
kets in different shapes may be 
formed by winding strands around 
the bottom or outside of cups or 
other dishes, which should be but- 
tered on the outside, adding a suit- 
able handle and setting the whole 
away to cool. When cold it may be 
easily removed. 

Candy canes may be rolled and 
twisted on a sheet of waxed paper; 
or strips of party-colored taffy may 
be twisted or braided and cut into 
sticks with scissors. The work must 
be done quickh'' as soon as the candy 
is cool enough to bear the hands, as 
after it sets it cannot be worked to 
advantage. When taffy is poured 
from the kettle use only the quantity 
that will run freely. Keep the scrap- 
ings by themselves, as if they are 
added to the candy they may cause 
it to harden and grain. 

Molasses Taffy.— Boil in a buttered 
kettle for 3 hours over a slow fire, 
or until the sirup ceases to boil, 1 
quart of Porto Rico molasses and i 
pound of light-brown sugar. Stir 
frequently to prevent burning or 
boiling over. When nearly done stir 
in the juice of a large lemon. When 
it hardens in water pour into but- 
tered pans. 

Or boil over a slow fire to the ball 
1 quart of Porto Rico molasses and 
1 gill of cold water. Now stir in 1 
tablespoonful of butter, 1 teaspoon- 
ful of brown sugar. Boil until it 
hardens in water and pour in a but- 
tered pan to cool. 

Or boil together 1 cupful of mo- 
lasses, 1 cupful of sugar, butter the 
size of an egg, until it will harden in 
cold water. Cool in a buttered 
pan. 

Everton Taffy. — To make this cele- 
brated taffy extract the juice of a 
large lemon and grate * the rind. Mix 
n pounds of coffee sugar, 3* ounces 
of butter, IJ cupfuls of water, and 
the grated lemon rind. Boil together 
over a quick fire, stirring constantly 
until it becomes hard and brittle in 



cold water. Remove from the fire, 
stir in the lemon juice and pour in 
buttered tins to cool. 

Buttercups. — Make any desired 
quantity of taffy and pour out about 
^ inch deep to cool on a smooth but- 
tered surface. Warm a similar quan- 
tity of stiff fondant, and work it 
near the fire until it is creamy and 
soft. Pull the taffy as soon as it 
will bear the hands until it is white, 
stretch it out in broad, fiat strips, lay 
a roll of fondant in tlie center of 
each strip, roll the fondant in the 
taffy and cut the strips crosswise 
with a sharp scissors to any desired 
length. 

To Pull Candy. — The best way to 
pull candy is to grease the hands 
thoroughly with butter to prevent 
sticking, or they may he covered with 
flour. The work should commence as 
soon as the candy is cool enough to 
bear the hands. Work with the tips 
of the fingers until it grows cool. 
Continue to pull until it is of a light 
golden color, or white, according to 
the recipe. Pull smartly, either by 
the help of another person or over a 
hook. Finally, draw out in sticks on 
waxed paper, or other smooth sur- 
face, which may be dusted with flour 
and cut with shears into sticks. 

Pulled Taffy for a Taffy Pull.— 
Either sugar or molasses taffy may 
be pulled. For sugar taffy, boil to- 
gether to the soft ball 3 cupfuls of 
granulated sugar, i cujiful of vine- 
gar, i cupful of water; now add 1 
tablespoonful of butter stirred in 
quickly, and boil until it hardens and 
becomes brittle in cold water. Add 
any flavoring extract desired just 
before removing from the fire. Pour 
on a buttered platter to cool, turn in 
the edges as fast as it cools, and 
when cold enough to handle puU un- 
til white and brittle. 

Or for molasses taffy boil to the 
soft ball 1 quart of New Orleans mo- 
lasses, 1 tablespoonful of granulated 
sugar. Now stir in H tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar, i pound of butter, and 
boil until it becomes hard and brittle 
in cold water. Just before removing 
from the fire stir in i teaspoonfiil 
of soda dissolved in hot water and 
puU. 



CANDIES AND CANDY-MAKING 



&S1 



Or boil together to the hard snap 
2 cupfuls of brown sugar, 1 cupful 
of molasses, * cupful of water, 1 
tablespoon of vinegar. Just before 
removing from the fire stir in * tea- 
spoonful of soda dissolved in hot 
water. Test in cold water. Add 
flavoring matter and pull until the 
color becomes a rich gold. 

To Make Molasses Candy. — The 
simplest way to make old-fashioned 
molasses candy for a candy pull is to 
boil the best Porto Rico molasses over 
a slow fire until it is done, which 
will require 3 hours or more. But- 
ter a large saucepan which will hold 
about four times the quantity of mo- 
lasses to be used. Stir frequently, 
especially when nearly done, to keep 
it from burning or boiling over. To 
test it, pour a spoonful into cold 
water; if it is hard, brittle, and snaps 
like a pipestem without bending, it 
is done, otherwise the boiling must 
continue. It is, however, quite cus- 
tomary to mix with molasses about 
i as much brown sugar to make it 
boil more quickly, and some persons 
add a little butter or glycerin to 
make it pull easier. Others stir in 
i teaspoqnful of baking soda dissolved 
in an equal amount of water or a 
little vinegar when the candy is nearly 
done to make it more brittle. The 
flavoring matter, if any, should be 
added just before the candy is taken 
from the fire and may be quickly 
stirred in or merely dropped on the 
top of the mass. Nuts of all kinds 
may be stirred into the candy just 
before removing it from the stove, 
or they may be placed in the buttered 
pan and the candy poured over them. 
The flavoring matter will be worked 
in when the candy is pulled. When 
done it should be poured out on a 
large buttered platter on pan so as to 
be about i inch thick to cool. As the 
edges cool they should be turned in 
and as soon as it will bear the hands 
the pulling should commence. 

Or boil together in a buttered 
saucepan over a slow fire for 2 hours, 
stirring frequently, 1 quart of mo- 
lasses and U pounds of light-brown 
sugar. Now stir in the juice of a 
large lemon and 1-2 drops oil of lemon, 
and continue the heat until the sirup 



ceases to boil. Test by dropping a 
little in water, when, if done, it should 
be crisp and brittle. Pour in a but- 
tered pan to cool. 

Or 2 quarts of Porto Rico mo- 
lasses, 1 pound of brown sugar, the 
juice of 2 large lemons or a tea- 
spoonful of strong essence of 
lemon. 

Or 2 cupfuls of molasses, 1 cupful 
of sugar, butter the size of an egg, 1 
tablespoonful of glycerin. Test by 
letting a few drops fall in cold water. 
If they keep their shape and are brit- 
tle it is done, but do not boil too 
much. Stir in 1 teaspoonful cream 
of tartar or soda just before remov- 
ing from the fire. 

Butter-scotch. — To make butter- 
scotch the ingredients may all be 
boiled together, or the butter and 
flavoring matter may be added to the 
sirup after it has boiled about twenty 
minutes, or when nearly ready to take 
from the fire. The sirup should boil 
to the hard-snap stage. To test when 
it is done, either use the confection- 
ers' test with the fingers, or test by 
dropping in cold water or on a cold 
plate, when it will harden if boiled 
sufficiently. 

The following recipes are recom- 
mended : 

Boil to a hard snap | cupful of 
sugar, i cupful of molasses, i cupful 
of butter, * tablespoonful of vinegar, 
i teaspoonful of soda, stirring suf- 
ficiently to prevent burning. 

Flavor to taste, after removing 
from the fire. Butter a tin and pour 
out the sirup in a thin layer, wliich 
may be checked off in any desired 
shape when nearly cold with a sharp 
knife. Wrap in a piece of waxed 
paper. This is among the best reci- 
pes and very easy to make. 

Or boil 1 pound of sugar in 1 pint 
of water to the soft ball, stir in 1 ta- 
blespoonful of butter, boil to the hard 
snap, remove from the fire and flavor 
to taste. 

Boil to the soft ball 3 pounds of 
light-brown sugar, 2 pints of water. 
When done it should be crisp and not 
hard when dropped in water. Now 
stir in 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, boil 
to the hard snap, remove and flavor 
to taste.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



SIRUP CAITDIES 

Sirup candies may be made of any 
desired flavor by boiling a sirup the 
same as for molasses candy. Clarify 
it by adding a little carefully picked 
gum arable dissolved in hot water. 
The impurities which are taken up 
by the gum rise to the surface and 
can be removed with the skimmer. 
Continue to boil and skim until the 
sirup becomes perfectly clear and is 
hard and brittle when dropped into 
cold water. This will require half an 
hour or more steady boiling over a 
slow fire. Remove from the fire and 
as soon as the boiling subsides stir 
in vanilla, wintergreen, hoarhound, 
peppermint, rose, or any other fla- 
voring matter as desired. Pour out 
in buttered tins to cool, and when 
nearly cold mark into squares or any 
desired shape with a sharp knife. 

The following recipes are recom- 
mended: 

To 3 pounds of dark-brown sugar 
add 1^ pints of water and i ounce 
of gum arable dissolved in a little hot 
water. 

Or boil together 1 quart of sirup, 
1 pound of granulated sugar, 1 tea- 
spoonful of butter, 1 tablespoonful 
of glycerin. 

Or 2 pounds of granulated sugar, 
§ cupful of water, i cupful of vine- 
gar, butter the size of an egg, 1 ta- 
blespoonful of glycerin. Just be- 
fore taking from the fire stir in 1 
level teaspoonful of soda and pour 2 
teaspoonfuls of vanilla, wintergreen, 
or any other flavoring matter over 
the top. Pull until white and glis- 
tening, and cut to any desired shape 
with sharp scissors. 

Maple Sirup Candy. — Boil down 
any desired quantity of maple sirup 
until it will harden and crack if 
dropped into cold water. When it is 
done, and just before removing from 
the fire, stir in a teaspoonful of but- 
ter for each cupful of sirup. This 
gives a hard candy. 

Or it may be made soft and waxy 
by less boiling. 

Or melt down 2 pounds of maple 
sugar in rather less than a pint of 
warm water. Boil until it hardens 
in cold water, and stir in 3 or 4 



tablespoonfuls of pure cider vinegar. 
In both cases pour in buttered pans 
to the deptli of about .} inch to cool. 

Twist Candy. — Boil witliout skim- 
ming over a slow fire H pounds of 
granulated sugar and i pint of water, 
for half an hour. Remove from the 
fire and as soon as the hands will 
bear it pull it the same as molasses 
candy until it is white and glossj'. 
Work it into fancy sha]ics and cut it 
to any desired size with a sharji scis- 
sors. 

Sugar Candy. — Boil together with- 
out stirring 2 cupfuls of white coffee 
sugar, k cupful of good cider vine- 
gar, and § cupful of water, until it 
hardens in cold water. Pour over it 
any desired flavoring matter, cool on 
a smooth buttered surface and pull 
until it is white and glossy, but with- 
out twisting. Do not use butter on 
the hands, but have them clean and 
dry. 

To make nut candy, place the nuts 
or popcorn in the dish, and pour this 
fondant over them. 

Rock Candy. — A special kettle is 
required to make fine rock candy. 
This kettle should be broad and shal- 
low, the width being three or four 
times the depth. Place in the bottom 
of the kettle a circular rim of smooth 
tin about 2 inches high and closely 
fitting to the inside of the kettle all 
around. Near the top of this make 
ten or twelve holes in a circle all 
around at equal distances from each 
other, and string across threads from 
one side to the other on which the 
candy may crystallize. 

Prepare the sirup in a separate 
vessel, and when it is done pour it 
into the kettle so that it will reach an 
inch above the threads. Place the 
kettle on the stove at a moderate 
heat and leave it to crystallize, shak- 
ing it from time to time. It will re- 
quire about six days. When the crys- 
tals have formed pour off the remain- 
ing sirup and dash in a little cold 
water to clean the crystals from the 
sediment left in the bottom of the 
kettle. Remove the rim with the 
rock candy adhering to the threads, 
and set it in a clean vessel in a hot 
oven until it is dry and fit for use. 

To prepare the sirup clarify re-

fined granulated sugar, filter and boil 
until it is ready to crystallize, which 
will be at 35 degrees on the sirup 
test. 



CANDIED FRUITS, FRUIT AND NUT 
CANDIES 

To Candy Fruits. — Use for this 
purpose fine white loaf sugar in any 
quantity desired. Dip each lump 
into clear soft water and drop the 
moistened lumps into a porcelain or 
other saucepan. Boil to the caramel 
state, removing the scum as fast as 
it appears. Remove the saucepan 
from the fire and place it in a vessel 
of hot water. As soon as the sirup 
ceases to boil, dip the fruit to be 
candied, one by one, into the hot 
sirup, and place it to dry and harden 
in a cool place. Almost any kind of 
ripe fruit may be candied in this 
manner, as ripe grapes, plums, cher- 
ries, sections of orange, lemon, or 
pineapple, etc. 

Or make a sirup of 3i pounds of 
granulated sugar and 1 pint of soft 
water or distilled water by boiling 
3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the 
fire, immerse the fruit, and let stand 
2 or 3 hours. Strain off the sirup, 
which may be used for other can- 
dies, and let the fruit stand in front 
of a baking oven with the door open 
until the moisture is dried out, when 
the sugar will crystallize. 

Candied Peel. — To candy orange 
or lemon peel, first soak peel in salt 
and water 4 or 5 days, changing 
the water frequently as it becomes 
bitter. When the bitterness has been 
removed, rinse them in clear warm 
water and boil in soft water until 
they are tender. Make a sirup at 
the rate of 3 pounds of loaf sugar 
to a pint of water, stir in the peels 
and boil to the caramel stage. Put 
them to drain in a siev^e, powder 
them with Confectioners' XXX su- 
gar, and let them dry on the edge of 
a cool oven with the door open. 
Store in a cool place to harden. 

Candied Orange Marmalade. — Re- 
move the juice and pulp of sweet 
Florida or naval oranges, taking care 
to pick out the seeds and inside skin. 
For bitter marmalade, boil the rinds 



at once until they become tender. 
Or, if the bitterness is not desired, 
use peels that have been soaked four 
or five days in advance in salt water, 
but the pulp must be freshly ex- 
tracted. 

Finally, in either case boil the peel 
until it is tender. Chop or crush it 
fine, stir in the pulp and juice, add 
double the weight of moist loaf sugar 
and boil over a slow fire to the cara- 
mel stage, which will take about half 
an hour. Preserve in small jars cov- 
ered with waxed paper. 

Fruit Sweetmeats. — Make a clari- 
fied sirup of i pound of coffee or 
brown sugar by stirring in the white 
of an egg and skimming it out as the 
sirup boils. Stir in 1 pound of sliced 
fruit, as peaches, pears, or sweet ap- 
ples, etc., and boil to the thickness 
of jelly. Or, if desired, place the 
whole peaches in cold water without 
peeling them, and bring them to a 
boil. Remove and dry them on a 
towel, and immerse them in boiling 
sirup. 

Or dip small fruit, as cherries, rasp- 
berries, plums, etc., in white of egg, 
place them in a sieve, dust with XXX 
powdered sugar, and shake until well 
coated. 

Orange Straws. — Boil orange peel 
in soft water in a large saucepan un- 
til it is tender, using plenty of water, 
and changing it frequently as it 
grows bitter. Place in a 'sieve to 
drain, and when cold enough to han- 
dle cut into narrow strips with a 
sharp, thin knife blade. Boil in sirup 
to the caramel stage and dry in a 
warm place. 

Or cut the orange peel into strips 
i inch thick; cover with water and 
boil 5 minutes. Drain off the water 
and cover again, continuing to 
do this until the water has been 
changed three times. Care must be 
taken not to let the strips lose their 
form. Now drop them into a boiling 
sirup of li cups sugar, and i cup wa- 
ter, and simmer 10 minutes. Remove, 
drain, and roll in granulated sugar. 
These sticks are better after stand- 
ing several days. — Gertrude B. Day. 

Fig Candy. — Boil to the hard ball 
over a slow fire 1 pound of granu- 
lated sugar in 1 pint of water. Stir 



5M 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



in J tcaspoonful of vinegar, a lump 
of butter the size of an English wal- 
nut, and pour over split figs pre- 
viously prejiared in a buttered pan. 

Date Candy. — Remove the pits 
from any desired quantity of dates, 
and lay them in rows side by side 
in the bottom of a buttered pan 
about i inch apart. Pour over these 
a sirup prepared as for fig candy. 
Let stand until cold. When nearly 
cold mark between the rows of dates 
with a sharp knife blade, \\lien the 
candy is set cut along these lines and 
wrap the bars in waxed or buttered 
paper. 

Candy Fritters. — For 4 pounds 
fondant use 1 pound English walnuts 
and ^ pound pecans, chopped fine. 
Melt the fondant slowly in double 
boiler, stirring frequently. When the 
fondant is thoroughly melted, add the 
chopped nuts, flavor with vanilla to 
taste, and drop from a teaspoon onto 
waxed paper. Maple fritters may be 
made the same as above. But use 
maple fondant and omit the vanilla. 
— Leona Bates. 

Raisin Candy. — Prepare the sirup 
as for fig and date candy, cover the 
bottom of a buttered pan with a layer 
of seeded raisins, pour on this a thin 
layer of sirup, add more raisins, and 
so" continue until the candy is of any 
desired thickness. Mark in squares 
when nearly cold. 

Fig Bars. — Boil to the soft thread 
4 cupfuls of granulated sugar and 1 
cupful of water to which J tea- 
spoonful of cream of tartar has been 
added. Now stir in a pound of finely 
chopped figs, boil to the hard thread, 
take off the fire and sift in a half 
cupful of powdered sugar. Work 
the whole with a wooden spoon or 
paddle to a thick, smooth mass, using 
additional sugar, if necessary. Pour 
out on a smooth surface, lay over it 
a sheet of waxed paper and press 
down smooth with the bottom of a 
tin pan or any smooth, hard surface. 
Melt with gentle heat 1 pound of 
fondant in an earthenware bowl, set 
on a hot soapstone or in a pan of 
boiling water. Flavor to taste. Re- 
move the waxed paper from the fig 
paste, pour over it a layer of the 
fondant, let the whole harden, reverse 



if desired, and pour a laj^er of fon- 
dant on the other side, and when hard 
cut it into bars and wrap in waxed 
tissue paper. 

Nut Balls. — Melt an ounce of 
granulated sugar until it turns a pale 
brown, add an ounce and a half of 
pecan nuts, chopped quite fine, and 
stir over the fire for a few minutes. 
Spread on a buttered dish to harden. 
When quite cold chop fine, mix with 
an equal quantity of French cream, 
flavor with vanilla, rose or orange 
and roll into marbles to be laid aside 
till somewhat hardened. Dip these in 
melted chocolate as for ordinary 
chocolate creams. — Mrs. Chas. Mat- 
thews. 

To Candy Nuts. — Boil together 3 
cups of sugar and 1 cup of water 
until it hardens when dropped in cold 
water. Flavor with lemon, but ob- 
serve that it must not boil after the 
lemon is in. Impale each nut meat 
on the end of a knitting needle, dip, 
take out, and turn on the needle until 
cold. If the candy cools and hardens 
place it on the stove for a few min- 
utes. Grapes and oranges quartered 
maj' be candied in the same way. 

Hickory Nut Candy. 

1 cup of hickory nut meats, 
chopped fine, 

2 cups granulated sugar, 
i cup water. 

Boil sugar and water without stir- 
ring until thick enough to spin a 
thread. Flavor with extract of vanilla 
or lemon. Set off into cold water, 
stir quickly until white, then stir in 
nuts, and finally turn into a flat tin. 
When cold cut into small squares. — 
Carriedine Morgan. 

Ginger Candy. — Boil over a quick 
fire 1 pound of granulated sugar 
with i pint of spring water. When 
dissolved mix a spoonful of finely 
powdered Chinese ginger with 2 or 3 
ounces of the sirup and stir it into 
tlie whole. Boil to the blow and at 
this stage stir in the rind of a large 
lemon, grated, and continue to stir 
until a spoonful dropped on a cold 
plate remains stiff without falling. 
Remove at once and drop from a 



CANDIES AND CANDY-MAKING

pan having a lip or spout, on but- 
tered tins in pieces the size of maca- 
roons. 

Fruit Rolls. — Mix seeded raisins, 
lemons, figs, dates, citron, or any de- 
sired sweetmeats, and chop them to- 
gether. Knead the whole with enough 
fondant to give consistency to the 
mass, which should be very rich and 
nearly all fruit. Roll this on a mold- 
ing board dusted with flour or con- 
fectioners' sugar into a roll i inch 
thick and 1 inch or more in width. 
Roll out plain white fondant i inch 
thick and 4 inches in width, and roll 
up the fruit roll in the plain fondant 
as a cover. Let stand over night to 
harden, cut into 4-inch lengths, cover 
with melted chocolate, and lay on 
waxed paper to cool. 

Jelly Rolls. — Make crab-apple, 
currant, or any other jelly as stiif as 
possible, and pour out on a buttered 
tin pan to the depth of i inch. 
Roll out on a molding board dusted 
with Confectioners' XXX sugar, corn- 
starch, or flour a layer of plain 
French cream or fondant i inch 
thick, turn over the pan so that the 
sheet of jelly will lie upon this, and 
roll up the two in the same fashion 
as jelly cake. Let stand to harden, 
cut into slices. 

Fruit Tarts. — Lay ripe small fruit, 
as raspberries, cherries, plums, and 
the like, in glass fruit jars and cover 
each pound of fruit with 6 ounces of 
powdered loaf sugar. Seal the jar, 
set it in boiling water up to the 
neck, and boil for 3 hours. The jars 
must be kept sealed until required 
for use. 

Fruit lozenges. — Place any small 
fruits, as currants, raspberries, cher- 
ries, and plums, in glass or earthen- 
ware jars set in boiling water. Scald 
and strain the fruit through a sieve. 
Add to each pint of juice an equal 
weight of finely sifted sugar and the 
white of an egg. Whip the whole to 
a stiff froth, drop on buttered paper, 
and place in a slow oven. As soon as 
they will loosen from the paper turn 
them and let stand in the oven until 
quite dry. Cut to any desired shape, 
pack between waxed papers, and keep 
in a dry place. 

Macaroons. — These popular con- 



fections are usually made of sweet or 
bitter almonds with sugar and the 
white of eggs, but sometimes with 
other substances, as nuts, flavoring 
matter, and the like. To make maca- 
roons blanch and pulverize a pound 
of almonds, adding a little rose wa- 
ter to form a moist elastic mass. 
Beat to a stiff froth the whites of 7 
eggs, stir in the almonds and a 
pound of Confectioners' XXX sugar. 
Drop the macaroons in the desired 
size on buttered paper from a spoon, 
and brown on tin plates in a slow 
baking oven. Set them aside in the 
pan in which they were baked until 
cold. 

Or pound 4 ounces of blanched 
sweet almonds with 4 tablespoonfuls 
of orange flower or rose water. Beat 
up the whites of 4 eggs to a stiff 
froth and stir all together with 1 
pound of Confectioners' XXX sugar. 
Brown in a slow oven. 

Or to 1 pound of sweet almonds, 
blanched and bruished with a little 
water, add 1^ pounds of sugar, the 
whites of 6 eggs and 2 grated lemon 
peels. Brown in a slow oven. 

Or, for pistachio macaroons, beat 
up with the whites of 2 eggs 4 ounces 
of pounded bitter almonds, 12 ounces 
of Confectioners' XXX sugar, 6 
ounces of shelled pistachio kernels, 1 
tablespoonful of orange or vanilla 
sugar. Brown in a slow oven. 

Kumquat Candy. — For 50 kumquats 
xise 1 cup sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls wa- 
ter, J tablespoonful cream tartar. 
Cut the kumquats in halves and cook 
fifteen minutes in a little water. Then 
drain. Make sirup of the sugar, wa- 
ter, and cream of tartar. Boil until 
it threads, then add the kumquats and 
boil until the sirup is all used. Take 
from the stove, press each kumquat 
into shape, fill with fondant, and 
put a nut on top of each. — Glenn 
Martin. 

FUDGE AND DIVINITY 

Plain Fudge. — Mix two cups gran- 
ulated sugar, two squares chocolate 
and i teaspoon cream of tartar with 
one cup of milk or water, and place 
over a hot fire. Stir the mixture 
steadily untU it comes to a boil, and

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



continue stirring at intervals while 
boiling to prevent chocolate from set- 
tling and sticking to the kettle. Boil 
to the soft ball degree, remove the 
saucepan to a cool place and let stand 
until it becomes lukewarm. Add one 
teaspoon vanilla and beat the mixture 
until it sets. While still warm pour it 
to cool into a well buttered tin and be- 
fore it cools cut into squares to serve. 

The secret of making good fudge 
lies in not boiling it too long and in 
beating it very thoroughly to make it 
fine and soft instead of granular. 
Recipes giving the number of minutes 
to boil fudge are suggestive but re- 
quire the use of good judgment. 
Fudge should always be boiled to the 
soft ball degree, which may be tested 
by dropping half a teaspoonful into 
cold water. If this can be rolled into 
a soft ball with the fingers without 
sticking, the fudge is done. It should 
then be removed from the fire to a 
cool place, allowed to stand until it 
becomes lukewarm and then stirred or 
beaten until the mixture sets. Some 
actual experience and observation is 
necessary to know just when to re- 
move the fudge froni the fire and also 
when to cease stirring and pour it 
into the pan, but with ordinary pains 
anyone can make good fudge from 
the following recipes. 

A great variety of excellent candies 
may be made by adding to plain fudge 
nut meats and other toothsome dain- 
ties of different kinds. Several of the 
best known and most popular recipes 
for fudge are as follows, but if the 
directions given for plain fudge are 
closely followed, these may be altered 
or modified by experiment in other 
particulars almost at will. 

Smith College Fudge. — Boil for 
about five minutes or to the soft ball 
degree, three cups granulated sugar, 
4 cup milk, and two squares choco- 
late. Remove from the fire, let cool 
until lukewarm, and beat in a piece 
of butter the size of an egg and one 
teaspoon vanilla. 

Nut Fudge. — Use either of the 
foregoing recipes, but when stirring 
in the flavoring add also one cup of 
any kind or assortment of nut meats. 

Peanut Butter Fudge. — Take 2 
cups sugar, 1 cup water, white of 1 



egg, 1 tablespoonful butter, 3 table- 
spoonfuls peanut butter. Dissolve 
the sugar in the water, boil to the soft 
ball stage and add the butter. Have 
white of egg beaten stiffly, and grad- 
ually beat in the sirup. To this mix- 
ture add the peanut butter and con- 
tinue beating until smooth and 
creamy. Pour out on buttered tin. 
Mark into squares. Two tablespoon- 
fuls of cocoa may be mixed with the 
sugar, if desired. — Lora Gilbert. 

Divinity. — Take 2 cups sugar, i 
cup hot water, ^ cup nut meats, ^ 
cup corn sirup, whites of 2 eggs. 
Boil the sugar, sirup and water until 
it forms a hard ball when dropped 
into cold water. Beat the whites un- 
til stiff and pour sirup over them, 
beat the mixture until it begins to 
thicken, then add nuts. When stiff 
enough to hold its shape turn into but- 
tered molds. — Margola Kyle. 

Cocoa Fudges. 
3 cups sugar, 
1 cup milk, 

IJ tablespoonfuls cocoa, 
1 tablespoonful butter, 
1 cup nut meats, 

1 teaspoonful vanilla. 

Mix sugar and cocoa, add milk and 
cook until it forms a soft ball in wa- 
ter. Remove from the stove, set in 
a pan of cold water, and add but- 
ter, nuts and vanilla. ^S'hen nearly 
cool, heat well and pour into a but- 
tered pan. — Mrs. J. E. Anderson. 

Divinity Candy. 

i cup corn sirup, 
^ cup water, 

2 cups sugar, 

2 whites of egg. 

Boil the corn sirup, water and 
sugar until it will form a hard ball 
in water. Beat until somewhat cool. 
To this add the beaten whites of the 
eggs, heating constantly until the 
candy thickens. To this may be 
added nuts, cocoanut or any dry fruit. 
Mrs. E. A. Banks. 

Penoche Candy. 

3 cups dark brown or maple 
sugar, 



CANDIES AND CANDY-MAKING 



527 



1 cup milk, 

1 tablespoonful butter. 

Boil sugar and milk until it will 
form a soft ball in cold water. Add 
1 teaspoonful of vanilla, and beat 
vigorously as it cools and thickens. 
Stir in one or two cups of broken 
English walnuts, pecans or other nut 
meats. Turn into buttered pans to 
cool. — Mrs. E. A. Banks. 

Marshmallow Fudge. — Follow either 
of the foregoing recipes with or with- 
out the nut meats and beat in also one 
cup of marshmallows cut fine. Scat- 
ter evenly over a buttered tin in 
which the fudge is poured out to cool, 
another cup of chopped marshmal- 
lows. Cut into squares to serve. 

Fudge Nougat. — Boil together to 
the soft ball degree, 2 cups granu- 
lated sugar, 1 cup milk, 1 tablespoon 
butter, and a pinch of salt. Remove 
from the fire, add the juice of half 
an orange, beat one minute and add 
one cup raisins, figs, and chopped nuts 
mixed together. Pour out to cool into 
a buttered pan, and cut into squares 
to serve. 

Lemon Cocoanut Fudge. — Boil to- 
gether for 12 minutes 1 lb. granulated 
sugar, juice of 2 lemons, grated rind 
of 1 lemon, i cup cocoanut and a 
piece of butter the size of an English 
walnut. Remove from the fire and 
beat to the consistency of cream. 
Pour to cool on buttered tins and cut 
into squares to serve. 

Sultana Fudge. — Boil together to 
the soft ball degree 3 cups granulated 
sugar, h cup milk, 2 cups molasses, 
and 2 squares chocolate. Remove 
from the fire and thoroughly beat in 
i cup nut meats and i cup Sultana 
raisins. When the mixture thickens, 
turn out into a buttered pan and cut 
into squares to serve. 

ALMOND CANDIES 

Sugared Almonds. — These bonbons 
are of two sorts: burnt almonds, 
sometimes called pralines, and sug- 
ared almonds, sometimes called 
dragees. They consist of whole alm- 
onds coated with sugar, which is often 
colored in various delicate tints. 

To make burnt almonds, bring to a 



boil over a moderate fire ^ pound of 
finely granulated sugar in -} pint of 
water in a round-bottomed vessel, 
stirring constantly with a wooden 
spoon until dissolved. Then throw in 
1 pound of fine Jordan almonds 
shelled and sifted, to remove dust and 
dirt. Stir in the almonds gently in 
the sirup until they are heard to 
crackle slightly. Take them off the 
fire and stir vigorously so that the 
sugar grains and becomes almost a 
powder, and each almond has a com- 
plete coat. Pick out the almonds, 
shake them gently in a coarse sieve to 
remove the loose sugar, and cover them 
with a folded flannel cloth to keep 
them warm. Replace the sugar, add 
i pound of Confectioners' XXX sugar 
and i pint of water with a teaspoon- 
ful of any desired coloring matter. 

Boil to the soft ball, remove from 
the fire and stir in the almonds as 
before. Again sift out the loose sug- 
ar and repeat the process until the 
candies are of the desired size. 

Or blanch any desired quantity of 
almonds and fry them to a light- 
brown color in butter. Roll them in 
a napkin to remove the excess of but- 
ter, and pour over them a sirup of 
white sugar boiled to a thread, stir- 
ring until they are quite cold. This 
is a celebrated Indian sweetmeat. 

To Gloss Burnt Almonds. — Dis- 
solve 2 tablespoonfuls of gum arable 
in 4 tablespoonfuls of water in a 
double boiler. Drop the burnt alm- 
onds in this after they have become 
cold and hardened, stir them gently 
and turn them out in a sieve. After 
the gummed water has dripped away 
shake the sieve gently over a slow fire 
until they are dry. 

Or pour over a little clean white 
gum shellac sufficient alcohol to cover 
it, and let stand over night. Pour off 
the clear solution from the sediment, 
dilute with alcohol, and apply to the 
burnt almonds with a brush. 

CARAMELS 

To make caramels in general boil 
clarified sugar until it is very brittle 
or to the point where it begins to 
gain more or less color and give off 
an acrid smell. But care must be 



528 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



taken not to burn the sugar or dark- 
en it beyond a light-brown shade. 
Then pour the sirup on an oiled mar- 
ble slab or tin, let cool until nearly 
hard, mark in small squares or cut 
out with a mold and lay away on 
waxed paper to harden. 

If no suitable mold is at hand mark 
off the slab i inch deep or more with 
the back of a case knife and sprinkle 
slightly with powdered sugar to keep 
the marks open. 

Chocolate Caramels. — Boil in a 
double boiler 1 cupful of grated 
chocolate, 1 cupful of brown sugar, 
1 cupful of molasses, i cupful of 
sweet milk, until it hardens when 
dropped in cold water. Now stir in 
a piece of butter as large as an egg 
and 1 cupful of chopped nuts of any 
kind, or any desired mixture of nuts. 
Pour into a buttered tin pan and cut 
into squares or mold when nearly cold. 

Or boil 1 pound of sugar to the 
hard snap and stir in 4 ounces of 
grated chocolate dissolved in a table- 
spoonful of hot water. Boil until the 
sirup caramels. 

Or boil over a hot fire, stirring 
constantly, 4 ounces of grated choco- 
late, 1^ pounds of dark-brown sugar, 
6 ounces of butter, and i teacupful 
of milk. Remove from the fire as 
soon as it becomes hard on being 
dropped in water, and if wanted 
hard, pour immediately into buttered 
dishes. Or stir for a few minutes to 
give a sugary consistency. Flavor 
after removal from the fire with 
lemon, orange, or vanilla either in the 
form of essences or grated lemon or 
orange peel. 

Coffee Caramels. — Boil to the hard 
snap 1 pound of sugar, stir in black 
coflPee made from 2 ounces of coflfee 
with as little water as possible. 
Strain through cheese cloth. Con- 
tinue to boil until the sirup cara- 
mels. 

Maple Caramels. — Boil together in 
a double boiler or buttered sauce- 
pan * cupful of boiling water, 3 
cupfuls of pure maple sirup, 2 cup- 
fuls of coifee sugar, 3 tablespoonfuls 
of glucose, until the sirup threads or 
hardens in cold water. Then stir in 
a cupful of pure cream, h cupful of 
butter, and boil until it caramels. 



When it hardens on dropping in 
cold water pour out to cool. 

Lemon Caramels. — Stir into the 
boiled sirup at the hard-snap stage 
the yellow rind of a lemon grated and 
mixed with a lump of sugar dissolved 
in lemon juice and water. Stir well 
until the mixture hardens in water, 
then pour out to cool. 

Strawberry Caramels. — Boil to the 
hard-snap stage 2 cupfuls of granu- 
lated sugar, -2 tablespoonfuls of glu- 
cose, i cupful of boiling water, stir- 
ring constantly. Now stir in a cupful 
of cream and butter the size of an 
egg. Stir well until it hardens in wa- 
ter, pour out to cool, and while hot 
sprinkle thickly with grated cocoa- 
nut. When cold cut to any desired 
size. Use for this purpose preferably 
freshly grated cocoanut, but desiccated 
cocoanut may be used if necessary. 

KISSES AND MARSHMALLOWS 

These are made of Confectioners 
XXX or powdered sugar, stiffened 
with the white of egg or gum arable 
and browned in a baking oven. Bak- 
ing powder or cream of tartar is 
sometimes added to make them light- 
er. To make plain kisses, beat the 
whites of 4 eggs to a stiff broth and 
whip in i pound of powdered sugar. 
The harder the mass is beaten the 
stiff er the candy will be. Lay on wet 
paper on a piece of hard wood and 
bake in a moderate oven. 

Cocoanut Kisses. — Beat up togeth- 
er the whites of 3 eggs and whip in 

2 cupfuls of powdered sugar, 2 cup- 
fuls of freshly grated cocoanut, and 

3 teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 
Brown slightly in a quick oven. 

Chocolate Kisses. — Beat up 2 
whites of eggs and whip in 2 ounces 
of grated chocolate, 1 pound of Con- 
fectioners' XXX sugar. Bake in a 
slow oven on wet or buttered paper 
spread on a piece of hard wood. 

French Kisses. — Dissolve 3 cupfuls 
of granulated sugar in water, using 
no more water than is necessary, and 
add a pinch of cream of tartar. 
Bring to a boil, stir in a freshly 
grated cocoanut of medium size and 
boil to the thread. Add a drop or

cream with a wooden spoon or pad- 
dle. Drop the kisses upon sheets of 
clean tin from a pan having a lip 
or spout, cutting them to the size of 
macaroons with a sharp knife or wire. 
Nut Kisses. — Beat up the wliite of 

3 eggs and whip in 30 teaspoonfuls 
of pulverized sugar, 3 tablespoonfuls 
of brandy, and li cupfuls of finely 
chopped nuts. Flavor as desired. 
Beat all together to a stiff mass and 
drop on wet or buttered paper the 
size of large macaroons. Brown in a 
moderate oven. 

Wintergreen Kisses. — Beat up the 
whites of 3 eggs to a stiff froth and 
whip in gradually ^ pound of Con- 
fectioners' XXX sugar, and flavor 
with essence of wintergreen to taste. 
Beat the whole very light, drop on 
wet or buttered paper, and bake on 
a piece of hard wood in a moderate 
oven to a light-brown color. 

Psyche's Kisses. — Boil the sugar 
to the crack, stir in 2 ounces of ap- 
ple juice while boiling, remove from 
the fire and stir in gradually about 
i its bulk of fruit juice, coffee, di- 
luted chocolate, or any kind of liqueur 
or flavoring matter desired, and set 
aside to cool. When cool beat up 
with a wooden paddle, stirring the 
mass vigorously from the sides and 
bottom until it becomes soft and 
clastic. This will be hard work at 
first, but gradually becomes easier. 
The longer it is worked the better 
the kisses will be. Let stand over 
night and warm with gentle heat 3 
or 4 ounces at a time in a sugar 
boiler with a spout, such as is used 
for pastils. Stir carefully and avoid 
burning or overheating. When the 
mass will pour readily drop from the 
spout on wet or buttered paper in 
pieces the size of macaroons. 

Marshmallows. — Cover an ouncie 
of carefully picked gum arabic with 

4 tablespoonfuls of water, and let 
stand for an hour. Heat the gum 
in a double boiler until it is dissolved. 
Strain through cheese cloth and whip 
in about 3* ounces of Confectioners' 
XXX sugar. Place on a moderate 
fire and heat for J of an hour, or 
until it comes to a stiff froth. Re- 
move from the fire, beat 2 or 3 min- 
utes while cooling and stir in i tea- 



spoonful of vanilla. Dust a tin pan 
with cornstarch, pour in the marsh- 
mallow, dust cornstarch over the top 
and set aside to cool. When cool cut 
into squares with a knife dipped in 
cornstarch, roll the squares in the 
starch and pack away in tin or other 
tight boxes. 

Or dissolve 5 cups granulated sugar 
in 3 cups water. Boil until it be- 
gins to string (slightly). Dissolve 
1 small package gelatin, in 3 table- 
spoonfuls water, add to the sugar and 
water, and beat well for A hour. 
Pour out on a large dripping pan, 
lined with paper covered with corn 
starch. Let cool, cut, and roll in 
cornstarch to keep from sticking. 
Or use confectionery sugar in place 
of cornstarch. This will make about 
100 marshmallows. — Mrs. Evelyne 
Conway. 

NOUGATS 

Nougats. — Nougat is made by 
melting in a copper sugar boiler 
granulated sugar with the addition of 
lemon juice at the rate of a dessert- 
spoonful to each pound of sugar and 
twice the weight of the sugar in alm- 
onds or other nuts, as filberts, pis- 
tachios, and the like, with a little 
sweet liqueur. The almonds and other 
nuts should be blanched, drained, 
and skinned, and allowed to stand 
for some hours before being used. 
They should then be placed just in- 
side the oven door to heat them thor- 
oughly, as they must be hot when put 
into the sirup. Nougat is used either 
to line molds or in the form of bars 
protected by layers of white wafer, 
For lining molds the nougat should 
be pressed into the mold with a lem- 
on until the inside is covered, and the 
edge of the mold should be trimmed 
with a sharp knife before it hardens, 
as it will then be brittle and likely 
to break. The mold should be oiled 
slightly and the nougat turned out as 
soon as it hardens. 

To Make Ordinary Nougat.— 
Blanch, drain, and skin 1 pound of 
almonds, and let stand until thor- 
oughly dry before chopping or shred- 
ding them. Place the shredded alm- 
onds on a pie plate just inside an

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



open oven door and dissolve in a cop- 
per sugar boiler 10 ounces of granu- 
lated sugar, stirring with a wooden 
spoon until it begins to melt. Stir 
constantly until the sugar comes to 
the pearl degree. Now add the alm- 
onds and stir them in. Have ready 
suitable molds oiled thinly with olive 
oil by means of a camel's-hair brush 
and pressing small pieces of the nou- 
gat into the mold with a piece of 
lemon until they are well coated. 
Trim the edge of the mold with a 
sharp knife. Turn out the nougat as 
soon as it hardens. 

Marseilles Nougat. — Melt 8 ounces 
of honey and remove the scum with a 
skimmer as fast as it appears. Boil 
to the crack degree 8 ounces of gran- 
ulated sugar, stir in the melted honey 
and ^ gill of orange-flower water, 
have ready in an egg bowl the whites 
of 3 eggs beaten to a stifif froth and 
pour into the egg bowl in a thin 
stream the melted honey and sirup, 
stirring constantly. Place the mix- 
ture over a slow fire and continue to 
stir. 

While the paste is baking, which 
will require about 3 hours' constant 
attention, test by dropping a spoon- 
ful of the paste in cold water. If 
it is brittle enough to be broken 
across without bending, it is done. 
Now stir in the almonds, lay out the 
white wafer on a molding board, and 
on this spread the nougat about 1 
inch deep. Cover with additional 
sheets of white wafer, lay a clean 
piece of white paper on top, and on 
this place a weight having a smooth 
surface, as a large weighted pan, to 
level it up. Let stand to cool and 
harden. Cut into any desired size, 
strips or bars, for use. 

Parisian Nougats. — Boil to the 
crack 6 ounces of granulated sugar, 
stir in 8 ounces of chopped pista- 
chio kernels, a few drops of cochi- 
neal, and coloring and flavoring mat- 
ter as desired. Spread out on a 
sheet of waxed paper, and while hot 
cut to any desired shapes and sizes 
with a sharp knife. This nougat may 
be dusted with granite sugar and 
cleaned currants if desired. 

Peanut Nougat. — Boil to the crack 
1 pound of granulated sugar, and 



stir in 1 quart of peanuts shelled, 
screened, and chopped fine, and sprin- 
kled with i teaspoonful of salt. 
Pour out on waxed paper or in a 
buttered tin and cut into bars for 



POPCORN CANDY 

Popcorn is used as an ingredient of 
candies in several forms, including 
the ordinary popcorn balls, popcorn 
cakes, bars, or nougats, and crystal- 
lized popcorn. 

Choose for this purpose a quality 
of popcorn which pops light and ten- 
der, and select only the kernels that 
are fully open, discarding burned or 
partially opened kernels. Shake the 
corn in a coarse sieve to free it from 
dust and chaff. It will be found a 
great aid in ])opping corn to swing a 
wire from a hook in the ceiling hav- 
ing a loop at the right height above 
the stove through which the handle 
of the popper can be passed. Thus 
the popper may be held over an open 
coal fire with less labor. 

To roll popcorn balls, dip the 
hands into very cold water before 
forming each ball and work quickly 
before the candy hardens. To im- 
prove the appearance of the balls, 
and also to prevent them sticking to 
the fingers, cut out a piece of tissue 
or waxed paper in circular form by 
cutting around the edge of a large 
pie plate, lay the ball on this, bring 
the edges together and twist them up 
at the top. Store popcorn balls in a 
cold place to prevent the popcorn 
from becoming tough. 

To Make Popcorn Balls. — Boil to 
the thread about 2i pounds of sugar 
with J pound of glucose and 1 pint 
of water. Place the popcorn in an 
earthenware bowl, pour the sirup over 
it, mix with 2 wooden paddles and 
form into balls with the wet hands. 

Or boil ^ pint of molasses about 
12 minutes to the stiff-ball degree. 
Place 2 quarts of popcorn in a wet 
earthenware bowl, pour the boiling 
molasses over it, mix with paddles, and 
roll with the wet hands. 

Or for a better quality of popcorn 
balls for home use, add to the above 
a good-sized piece of butter and 



CANDIES AND CANDY-MAKING

flavor with lemon extract or other- 
wise as desired. 

Or boil to the hard snap 1 pint 
of sugar i teaspoonful of butter, 
1 tablespoonful of vinegar with 
about i teacupful of soft water. 
Have ready about 1 peck of freshly 
popped corn in a wet pan or tub, dip 
the boiling sirup over it, mix with 
wooden paddles, roll with the wet 
hands. 

Popcorn Cakes. — Prepare sirup 
according to any of the above rules, 
but crush the corn with a rolling-pin. 
Stir the corn into the kettle when the 
sirup is at the hard-snap stage, and 
pour into buttered tins. Lay over the 
top a piece of buttered or waxed pa- 
per, and let stand under pressure to 
harden. When cold and hard cut 
into cakes with a thin, sharp knife 
blade. 

Crystallized Popcorn. — Place in an 
iron kettle or frying pan 1 teacup- 
ful of granulated sugar, 1 table- 
spoonful of butter, or less, 3 table- 
spoonfuls of water. Boil to the hard 
snap, stir in 2 or 3 quarts of popcorn 
and continue stirring until it is en- 
tirely dry. This amount of sirup will 
give a heavy coating of sugar to 2 
quarts, or a lighter coat to 3 quarts. 
A beginner is apt to think that the 
sirup is not sufficient for the quan- 
tity of corn, but with constant stir- 
ring it will come out all right. Con- 
tinue to stir until the corn is dry, but 
take care that the fire is not hot 
enough to scorch it. Nuts may be 
crystallized in a similar way. 

COUGH CANDIES 

Hoarhound Candy. — Boil the hoar- 
hound in a little water until the juice 
is extracted, and strain through 
cheese cloth. Boil any desired quan- 
tity of sugar with just enough water 
to dissolve it and stir in the juice. 
Work the sugar with a spoon against 
the sides of the pan until it grows 
thick and creamy. Pour out in a 
buttered pan. When nearly cold 
mark into squares and let dry. 

Or boil the sugar until candied and 
stir in dry and powdered hoarhound. 
Pour out in buttered tins to cool. 

Pine-tree Tar Cough Candy. — To 



10 pounds of granulated sugar add 3 
pints of water. Boil to the hard 
snap, pour out and while cooling 
spread on top 10 drops of tar (made 
by dissolving 1 tablespoonful of tar 
in 2 tablespoonfuls of alcohol), 1 ta- 
blespoonful of oil of capsicum, 1^ ta- 
blespoonfuls of oil of wintergreen. 
Work together with the hands or a 
wooden paddle until these substances 
are thoroughly worked in, keeping 
the mass warm before the fire, or by 
means of a soapstone. Roll into 
round sticks and keep rolling until 
cold. 

TO COLOR AND FLAVOR CANDY 

Colorings for Candy. — Coloring 
matter for candies can be purchased 
in small jars for a few cents each. 
These are so intense that a drop will 
tint a pound of candy. Hence they 
will last a long time. Red, yellow, 
orange, light green, violet, mara- 
schino, constitute a good assortment. 
Some knowledge of color is necessary 
to a tasteful eifect. White cream 
may, of course, be coated with any 
other color, but colored cream should 
be coated only with tints or shades 
of the same color. Otherwise the 
center will show through and pro- 
duce an unsatisfactory effect. The 
center should usually be of a lighter 
tint than the coating. A good rule 
when coating bonbons is, after hav- 
ing formed the centers, to set the 
fondant away for twenty-four hours. 
Then melt it with a little added 
coloring matter to give a deeper 
shade and coat the centers in this. 
Thus maple cream may be coated 
with maple fondant, chocolate cream 
with chocolate fondant, and tlie like. 

It is customary with confectioners 
to associate certain coloring with cer- 
tain flavoring. Almond or pistachio 
cream are usually tinted green. Or- 
ange or lemon flavoring are tinted 
with those colors. Rose is tinted pink. 
A good way to obtain suggestions 
for producing tasteful and artistic 
effects is to study the display in a 
good candy shop and imitate what 
you like best. 

To Color Confectionery. — Care 
must, of course, be taken in coloring 



632 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



confectionery not to use aniline dyes, 
mineral pigments, lakes, or any other 
substance of a poisonous nature. 
The animal and vegetable dyestuffs 
are usually harmless in small quanti- 
ties, but the following combinations 
are especially recommended: 

To Color Red. — Cover 1 ounce of 
cochineal with i pint of boiling wa- 
ter and boil about 5 minutes. Stir 
in 1 ounce of cream of tartar, i 
ounce of powdered alum, and con- 
tinue boiling about 10 minutes. 
Test by letting a few drops fall on a 
piece of clean white paper. If the 
color is not sufficientlj' clear and 
bright, boil a little longer. When 
done, stir in -2 ounces of granulated 
sugar and put up in a stoppered glass 
bottle for use. 

To Color Blue. — Dissolve a little 
indigo stone in warm water and test 
with a few drops on a piece of white 
paper. Continue to add more indigo 
until the color is bright and clear. 

To Color Yellow. — Dissolve a little 
gamboge in warm water, or the heart 
of a yellow lily with warm water, un- 
til the bright tint is produced. 

Or steep i ounce of saffron in soft 
■water for 24 hours or more until the 
proper tint is obtained. 

Or for small quantities, a good 
pinch of saffron in a spoonful of wa- 
ter may be boiled until the water is 
nearly evaporated. Squeeze out the 
juice through cheese cloth. This col- 
or is an orange yellow, and a few 
drops will go a long way. 

To Color Green. — Cover fresh spin- 
ach leaves with boiling water and let 
stand two or three minutes, or until 
the color is as strong as desired. 
Cork tightly to exclude the air. 

Or steep i ounce of saffron in soft 
water for 24 hours and steep sepa- 
rately i ounce of indigo carmine for 
the same length of time. Mix the 
two for use. This mixture can be 
preserved for a considerable time by 
adding clarified sirup and preserving 
in a closely stoppered glass vessel. 

Or for a larger quantity, wash a 
peck of fresh green spinach very 
carefully in several waters to remove 
all grit, and while dripping wet 
pound it with a suitable mallet or 
any piece of hard wood, to a soft 



pulp. Place this pulp in several 
thicknesses of cheese cloth and wring 
out the juice, which may be done by 
twisting the ends of the cloth by 
means of short sticks or rods. Place 
the juice over a gentle fire until it be- 
gins to curdle or thickens. Strain off 
the water through a piece of cheese 
cloth, leaving the thick part of the 
spinach juice on the cloth. This is 
the vegetable green or spinach green 
for confectioners. Care must be 
taken in drying substances colored 
with this material, as if the heat is 
too strong it is likely to take on a 
yellowish cast. 

To Color Pink. — Use a little car- 
mine moistened with rose water. 

Granite Sugar. — Crush by crack- 
ing it with a hammer a pound of fine 
loaf sugar into small lumps. Place 
these on a hard, smooth surface and 
break them up fine with a wooden 
mallet or any smooth piece of hard 
wood. Shake first through a coarse 
sieve to remove the lumps, and after- 
wards through a very fine sieve to re- 
move the powdered sugar. The re- 
sult will be in grains of intermediate 
size, like coarse sand or gravel, 
known by confectioners as granite 
sugar. 

To Color Granite Sugar. — Any of 
the above coloring matters may be 
used to tint granite sugar to any de- 
sired stage. Pour a few drops of the 
coloring matter in a plate, spread 
the sugar over this, and dry on a 
screen with very moderate heat. 
While drying, rub the sugar fre- 
quently between the hands to prevent 
the corners sticking together. Pre- 
serve in a closely stoppered glass 
bottle in a warm, dry place for use. 

Flavorings for Candy. — Buy only 
the most expensive grades of flavor- 
ing extracts for candies. Every first- 
class dealer has the better qualities 
or can obtain them on request. This 
is important for two reasons: the 
flavor of the candy will be improved 
and a few drops only will be re- 
quired. The less moisture added to 
fondant the easier it is to work. 

Or buy the essential oils of rose, 
wintergreen, peppermint, cloves, and 
others, drop them on lump sugar, 
pulverize the sugar with a rolling-pin 



CANDIES AND CANDY-MAKING 



533 



and carefully preserve in tightly stop- 
pered bottles until required for use. 

To Flavor Sugar. — As a matter of 
convenience in flavoring candies, it is 
customary with confectioners to fla- 
vor in advance a quantity of loaf or 
other sugar and have it in readiness 
to be mixed with sirup to impart any 
flavoring that may be desired. Fla- 
voring matter should not be added to 
sirup until the process of boiling is 
at an end and the sirup is ready to be 
taken from the fire, otherwise the 
flavor, which is usually imparted by 
one of the volatile essential oils, will 
be evaporated and lost. 

To Flavor Orange. — Grate the rind 
of 1 or more oranges on a suitable 
quaitity of lump sugar and place the 
whole in a tightly stoppered bottle 
until the sugar has been thoroughly 
impregnated and the rind dries and 
can be readily scraped off. Remove 
the rind and preserve the sugar for 
future use. 

To Prepare Lemon Sugar. — Grate 
the rind of 1 or more lemons and 
prepare in the same manner as or- 
ange sugar. 

Cinnamon Sugar. — Dry i ounce of 
cinnamon and pulverize with i pound 
of loaf sugar by grinding in a mor- 
tar or with a suitable piece of hard 
wood. Cork tightly and preserve for 
use. 

Clove Sugar. — Pulverize 1 ounce of 
cloves to i pound of loaf sugar and 
preserve in the same manner as cin- 
namon sugar. 

Ginger Sugar. — Preserve ^ ounce 
of pulverized ginger in the manner 
described above for cinnamon sugar. 

Vanilla Sugar. — Pulverize 4 sticks 
of vanilla with 2 pound of loaf sugar 
and preserve for use. 

ICES AND ICING 

Icings for Candy and Cake, — 
Icing, as ordinarily made, consists of 
powdered sugar beaten up to a stiff 
froth with white of egg. Gum ara- 
ble is frequently used to give addi- 
tional stiffness. The addition of but- 
ter or cream improves the flavor and 
prevents the icing from drying rap- 
idly or cracking when cut, and va- 
rious flavoring and coloring matters 



are added as desired. Icing may be 
of two sorts, either boiled or un- 
cooked. 

Uncooked Icing. — Beat up the 
whites of any required number of 
eggs to a stiff froth and whip into 
them Confectioners' XXX sugar un- 
til the icing is of the desired con- 
sistency. Generally speaking, the 
white of 1 egg will make sufficient 
icing for a small cake or 2 eggs for 
a large one. And the white of 1 egg 
will require i poimd of sugar, more 
or less. Some prefer to add the 
sugar gradually, while the white of 
egg is being beaten. The addition of 
a little lemon juice, while beating, 
will improve the color and flavor. 
The following recipe is recommended: 

Beat up the whites of 2 eggs to a 
stiff froth, whip in ^ pound of Con- 
fectioners' XXX or powdered sugar, 
i tablespoonful of starch, | ounce of 
pulverized gum arabic or less, and 1 
teaspoonful of lemon juice. Mix the 
sugar, starch, and gum arabic to- 
gether, and sift them into the white 
of egg. The longer the mixture is 
whipped or beaten the better the icing 
will be. 

Boiled Icing. — For an ordinary 
cake, boil a cupful of sugar to the 
thread. Beat in the white of 1 egg, 
I tablespoonful of cream or 1 tea- 
spoonful of butter. Now stir in, if 
convenient, 2 or 4 marshmallows and 
1 teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 
Beat the whole until cold. 

To Apply Icing. — To ice the top of 
a cake, but not the sides, dust the top 
with a little flour to kill the grease, 
which prevents the icing from run- 
ning, brush, blow, or dust oft' the ex- 
cess of flour and cut a band of white 
paper long enough to go around the 
cake and li inches wide, grease the 
inside with butter, dust it with flour, 
and pin it around the cake so that 
the upper edge will be i inch or more 
above the top. Pour on the frosting 
evenly, when if thin enough it will 
settle in a perfectly smooth and even 
surface. Let stand until it hardens, 
run a thin-bladed knife between the 
cake and the paper, and take off the 
paper. 

Or, after dusting the cake with 
flour, spread the icing with a broad 



534 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



knife blade or thin wooden paddle 
dipped in iced water, and set it on 
the edfre of an oven to harden, taking 
care that the oven is not hot enough 
to brown it. 

Or a second coat of fresh icing 
may be added the following day or 
after the first layer is hardened. Any 
ornamentation must be added while 
the icing is wet, as otherwise it will 
not adhere. 

To Ornament Icing. — For this pur- 
pose prepare a special icing by beat- 
ing slightly the white of 1 egg and 
stirring in gradually 2 cups of Con- 
fectioners' XXX sugar. Add the 
juice of i a lemon and beat the whole 
until the mixture is stiff and elastic. 
Now make a paper cone of stiff white 
writing paper, pinning the side and 
clipping off the point, so that the icing 
can come through in a pencil or point 
of any desired thickness. Small tin 
cones are provided which may be used 
for this purpose, but the paper cone 
will answer. Fill this with the icing 
^ or § full, fold in the top and press 
on it with the thumbs to force the 
icing through the small end of the 
funnel. 

Ice the cake as above, let it stand 
for fifteen or twenty minutes until 
the icing is " tacky " but not hard, 
trace the design on the cake lightly 
with a lead pencil and follow it with 
the icing forced through the paper 
funnel. The icing may be flavored 
and tinted as desired. 

Chocolate Icing. — A quick way to 
make chocolate icing for cake is to 
place a few good chocolate creams 
in a saucepan, add a tablespoonful or 
less of hot water or milk, and place 
it in a pan of hot water or over the 
steam of a teakettle until the choco- 
lates are dissolved. Stir thoroughly 
and apply. 

Or add to 1 pint of boiled icing 
prepared in the usual way 1 ounce of 
grated chocolates and the yolks of 2 
eggs. Mix and apply. 

Or beat up the vvhite of an egg 
in a bowl, dissolve i pound of grated 
chocolate in 1 cup of milk in a double 
boiler, stir in a cupful of powdered 
sugar and 1 teaspoonful of vanilla. 
Pour the mixture over the white of 
egg and beat to a stiff froth. 



Coffee Icing. — To 1 pint of icing 
prepared in the usual way add 2 
ounces of strong black coffee, A oimce 
of confectioners' sugar, and the yolks 
of 2 eggs. 

HONEY AND BEESWAX 

Honey. — Honey is not, as some 
suppose, produced by bees, but is the 
sweet material collected from flowers 
by the honeybee and stored by them 
as food for themselves and their pro- 
geny, hence the aroma and flavor of 
honey varies with its source, that 
from white clover or buckwheat usu- 
ally being regarded as the best. In 
Turkey and some other countries 
honey produced by certain plants is 
poisonous, and that of others is in- 
jurious to health. Honey is fre- 
quently adulterated with glycerin 
and glucose, and various imitations 
of honey can be made of other mate- 
rials suitably flavored with various 
essential oils. 

Honey is deposited by bees in wax 
cells known as honeycomb. When 
pure it consists partly of a sirup of 
sugar that will not crystallize, and 
partly of crystallized grains some- 
what like grape sugar. The finest 
quality, called virgin honey, is that 
which drips freely from the comb. 
The ordinary quaJity is obtained by 
melting the comb and extracting the 
honey by pressure. It should be 
noted that if honey is heated in iron 
or copper utensils it takes on a dark- 
er color, hence porcelain, earthenware, 
or tinware should be employed for 
this purpose. The proper proportion 
of water to be added in extracting or 
purifying honey is equal parts by 
weight. 

To Extract Honey. — First strain 
the comb through a sieve to free the 
honey from the wax. Melt it with 
gentle heat in a double boiler and take 
off the scum with a skimmer as fast 
it appears. Let cool, pour into jars 
and seal with paraflBn, waxed tops, or 
otherwise, so as to be air-tight. 

To Preserve Honey in the Comb. — 
Set aside for this purpose combs that 
do not contain pollen, stand them 
edgewise in earthenware jars or tin 
cans, and cover them with extracted 



CANDIES AND CANDY-MAKING 



535 



honey. Cover the tops with paraffin 
or otherwise to exclude the air. 

To Clarify Honey. — Melt down 
the pure honey in a double boiler of 
porcelain or earthenware, and strain 
while hot through a flannel cloth 
dipped in hot water. This dissolves 
the crystals and converts the honej^ 
into a uniform thick sirup. The test 
is not as acceptable, but the honey 
keeps better and is more wholesome. 

Or beat up the white of an egg to 
a stiff froth and whip it into 4 or 5 
pounds of honey. Stir in pure water 
to make a sirup of the consistency of 
cream, and boil until the white of egg 
can be removed with a skimmer. 
Pour out the honey into a milk can 
or other receptacle having a spigot or 
faucet at the bottom, and let stand 
for about a month. Then draw off 
the clarified honey from the spigot. 

Or melt down the honey in a dou- 
ble boiler with clear water to a sirup 
of the consistency of cream, and stir 
in 6 ounces of purified animal char- 
coal to 8 pounds of honey. Simmer 
with gentle heat for 20 minutes. 
If the sirup is sour, stir in a little 
prepared chalk to sweeten it, strain 
through a flannel cloth dipped in hot 
water, and let stand over a slow fire 
until the excess of water it contains 
is removed by evaporation. 

Or dissolve the honey with water 
in a double boiler, and let it boil up 
briskly, stirring four or five times at 
intervals, but not skimming. Re- 
move from the fire, let cool and pour 
on cloth strainers covered with an 
inch or more of fresh white sand. 
After the honey has run through, 
pour on gradually clear water, to 
rinse the strainer, and finally with 
gentle heat evaporate the excess of 
water from the honey. 

Or to clarify on a large scale, mix 
9 large fresh eggs with -2^ gallons of 
water for each half barrel of honey, 
in a tin-lined vat. Simmer with gen- 
tle heat, skim and filter through 
strong linen strainers covered with 
about 1 inch of clear white sand. 
Afterwards evaporate the excess of 
water with gentle heat. 

To Prepare Beeswax. — To prepare 
beeswax melt the honeycomb in boil- 
ing water. Let cool, when the wax 



will form a cake on the surface. Re- 
move the cake, scrape oflF any im- 
purities from the bottom, and repeat 
if necessary. 

To Refine Beeswax. — Add about 5 
per cent water to crude beeswax and 
melt with gentle heat. Raise to a 
boil, let boil for a few minutes, and 
add about 1 per cent concentrated 
nitric acid. Use for this purpose an 
earthenware vessel set in boiling wa- 
ter, and continue to boil until 
the fumes of the acid cease to be 
evolved. 

Or when the melted wax has boiled 
for a few minutes scatter 5 or 6 
per cent of sulphuric acid over the 
surface of the melted wax. It must 
be done with care. If the vessel Is 
not sufficiently deep the wax will 
froth up and run over the sides. Af- 
ter adding the acid cover the mix- 
ture, remove it from the fire, and be- 
fore it is quite cool skim it off with 
a heated ladle. Take care not to dis- 
turb the sediment. Scrape the im- 
purities from the inside of the cake. 
Remelt and strain through cheese 
cloth. The addition of a little annotto 
will improve the color of the wax. 

To Whiten Beeswax. — Melt up the 
wax with gentle heat and dip into it 
thin hard-wood boards, plates, or 
any suitable flat articles previously 
dipped in water to prevent the wax 
sticking. When these are removed 
they will be covered with a thin plate 
of wax. Loosen this film of wax with 
a knife and strip oflF. Spread these 
thin sheets upon a white cloth upon 
the grass and expose them to the sun 
and air to bleach. Afterwards re- 
melt and form into cakes. 

Or melt the wax with hot water 
and squeeze through a fine linen cloth. 
Pour in shallow molds and when hard 
expose to the air, sprinkling frequently 
with water and turning from time to 
time until quite white. 

To Color Beeswax. — To color bees- 
wax, add bright palm oil. Or as a 
sufficient quantity of palm oil to col- 
or adulterates the wax, color with 
annotto in the proportion of about 4 
ounces to 100 pounds of wax, accord- 
ing to the color required. Shave the 
annotto in 3 to 4 quarts of soft wa- 
ter, to which add about 1 pound of 



536 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



wax, let boil until the water is evapo- 
rated and the wax is of a deep- 
orange color. Melt the remainder of 
the wax, and stir in the colored wax 
until the proper shade is produced. 
Test from time to time by cooling a 
little on a glass plate. 

Bottle Wax. — To make wax for 
sealing corked bottles and similar 
purposes, melt together 6i ounces of 
black rosin, i ounce of beeswax, and 
li ounces of fine ivory black. 

Or for red wax, substitute 1^ 
ounces of Venetian rod or red lead 
for the ivory black. 

Or mix 1 poimd of beeswax, 1 



pound of rosin, ft pound of tallow. 
Color with red or yellow ocher or 
other coloring matter. Melt and stir 
together. 

Or for white wax, substitute 
bleached wax for beeswax and color 
with Spanish white. 

To Test Adulterated Wax. — Bees- 
wax is sometimes adulterated with 
spermaceti or Japanese wax. To test 
for Japanese wax, cover a sample 
with concentrated solution of borax 
and bring it to a boil. Beeswax is 
insoluble in this solution, but Japa- 
nese wax dissolves and forms on cool- 
ing a milky-white sticky coating. 



CHAPTER XXXVII 
TIRELESS COOKERY 



NATURE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE PROCESS — CONSTRUCTION 
AND USE OF THE HOMEMADE COOKER — RECIPES FOR FIRE- 
LESS COOKERY — TIME TABLE FOR FIRELESS COOKERY 



The term " Fireless Cooker " is 
really a misnomer and it is very un- 
fortunate that it has become attached 
to a device in which cookery is done 
by the process of retaining heat, once 
stored. The so-called Fireless Cooker 
as it exists to-day is an application 
of the old Norwegian cooking box, 
which is often referred to in our 
books of Physics as one of the best 
illustrations of the use of non-con- 
ductive material in retaining heat. 
The fireless cooker is not a miracle 
working cookery machine; and it has 
been handicapped from the start, not 
only by its misnomer, but by the ex- 
travagant claims that have been made 
for it by its admirers and promoters. 
Intelligently used it is a highly de- 
sirable addition to the kitchen equip- 
ment, but it can never entirely super- 
sede the cooking stove, nor is it by 
any means the most desirable method 
of carrying on all cookery processes. 
It will always be necessary for the 
housewife to employ some sort of a 
cook stove on which to start the cook- 
ing of the food material, but the pro- 
cess may then be finished, if desired, 
in the fireless cooker. 

This device, as was previously 
stated, is only a means for retaining 
heat previously applied. The chief 
essential of its construction, therefore, 
is that it shall be well insulated, that 
is thoroughly padded with non-con- 
ducting material so that hot things 
introduced into it shall remain hot, 
and cold things remain cold. The 



537 



principle, in short, is the same as that 
of the Thermos bottle. 

There are various types of fireless 
cookers on the market, differing in 
complexity from those containing only 
one compartment for food, up to 
much more elaborate devices of a 
comparatively high price. The most 
modern cookers are equipped with 
plates which are heated before being 
introduced into the compartment 
where the cooking is to be done. 
Even baking and roasting processes 
can be carried on in such cookers; 
but considerable experience is needed 
to gain thorough knowledge of the 
extent to which the plates should be 
heated before being introduced into 
the compartment, for much food may 
be spoiled by being burned to a 
crisp if too much heat is confined in 
the cooker. 

The fireless cooker is chiefly valu- 
able when a long, slow cooking is re- 
quired. In the present state of cook- 
ery knowledge, however, it is difloicult 
to say just when' this kind of process 
is desirable. Further experiments may 
show that a higher temperature is 
necessary for many food materials 
than is now applied by cooking in 
the fireless cooker. But until the 
housewife can be definitely informed 
regarding the greater desirability of 
the temperature on top of the stove, 
she will undoubtedly continue to use 
the fireless cooker as a convenience 
when the processes can be extended 
over a long time and require little 



538 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



watching. Books of directions are 
generally furnished with fireless cook- 
ers, but with this device, as with many 
other so-called labor saving conveni- 
ences, it is necessary that an intelli- 
gent brain be behind it. Unfortu- 
nately the cooker has been abused by 
those who considered it a " silent ser- 
vant," able to evolve a course dinner, 
done to a turn, while their interests 
were otherwise engaged. For the uses 
for which it is adapted it is invaluable: 
why should it be required to accom- 
plish the impossible and entirely to 
take the place of other satisfactory 
methods of cooking? 

Observe that the cooker is as use- 
ful for keeping frozen foods chilled 
as for retaining heat in a hot dish. 
Hence ice creams and cold drinks 
may be stored with advantage in the 
fireless cooker until ready for use. 

Several food experts have experi- 
mented in constructing practical 
home-made devices which will serve 
the purpose of the more elaborate 
commercial cookers. One of the 
cheapest and most simple was sug- 
gested by Miss Winifred Gibbs, who 
has made a particular study of low 
priced menus for pco})le of small in- 
comes. The method of construction is 
as follows: 

CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF 
HOMEMADE FIRELESS COOKER 

Materials Needed Estimated 

Cost 

Galvanized iron garbage can 

— "No. 2" $1.25 

Sawdust 10 

Two yards denim 25 

Covered agate pail — 2-4 qts. .35 

$1.95 
Method. 

Place loose sawdust in bottom of 
can, so that when food kettle and 
top cushion are in place all space 
will be filled. 

Fold denim lengthwise, make a 
long bag, about two inches deeper 
than food kettle, fill with sawdust, lay 
flat on table, spread sawdust evenly, 
and roll bag around food kettle, so 
that a smooth, firm nest is formed 



when bag is placed upright in can 
on top of sawdust. From remaining 
denim make a round bag (the ma- 
terial will have to be pieced for this), 
and fill with sawdust. 

Use of Cooker, 

Begin all cooking precisely as if 
it were to be carried on in the ordi- 
nary way. When food is at boiling 
heat, after having boiled the required 
length of time, place quickly in nest 
formed by long cushion, cover with 
round cushion, place galvanized cover 
over all, and let stand for required 
time. 

The following is a table showing 
foods best adapted for preparation 
in the homemade cooker.

A practice cooker can be made 
from a five-cent butter tub which will 
answer very well for purposes of 
illustration, but for long continued 
use the galvanized can is better, as it 
needs considerable care to keep a 
wood tub dampened so that it will not 
fall apart. 

One of the greatest advantages of 
the fireless cooker urged by its ad- 
\'ocates is that of fuel economy. It 
is of course true that a great saving 
of fuel is effected in those cookery 
processes that arc extended over long 
periods of time, for it costs only a 
fraction of a cent to start most of 
the processes which are later com- 
pleted in the cooker, whereas it would 
require an expenditure of several 
cents' worth of fuel to continue them 
for a long time on top of the stove. 
But this fuel economy does not apply 
to jirocesses which require only a 
fully as much, if not more, to heat 
short time. For example, it costs

the fireless cooker plates for baking 
a loaf of bread as it does to bake 
the bread in an ordinary gas oven. 
Unless it can be proved therefore, 
that the loaf of bread baked in the 
fireless cooker is a better loaf than 



that yielded by the ordinary method 
of cooking, it will be wise to reserve 
the fireless cooker for such processes 
as effect an economy in fuel and 
also yield a product of more desirable 
flavor.

A FEW RECIPES FOR FIRELESS 
COOKERY 

Beef Stew with Dumplings. 

2 cupfuls cooked or raw beef, 
2 cupfuls raw or cooked potatoes, 
g cupful tomato, 
1 onion, cut in slices, 
4 tablespoonfuls rendered fat or 
butter, 



1 teaspoonful salt, 

I teaspoonful pepper, 

J cupful flour, 

1 tablespoonful chopped parsley, 

IJ cupfuls water, or more. 

If cooked meat and potatoes are 
used, cut them in three-quarter inch 
dice, make a brown sauce of the fat, 
flour, seasoning, and water, add the 



FIRELESS COOKERY 



541 



vegetables and meat and enough wa- 
ter to just cover the stew. Place the 
dumplings on top, boil it for five min- 
utes, and place in cooker for one 
and one-quarter hours. If the meat 
is tough it will be better to treat it 
like raw beef. If raw beef is used, 
cut it in pieces, bring it to a boil 
with the water, and put it into the 
cooker for three or four hours be- 
fore adding the other ingredients. — 
Margaret J. INIitchell. 

Pot Roast. 

3 pounds beef rump, 
3 cupfuls boiling water, 
1 bay leaf, 

1 small onion, 
Salt and pepper, 

2 small carrots, 

2 sprigs parsley, 

^ teaspoonful celery seed, or i 

cupful celery, cut in pieces, 
Flour. 
i teaspoonful Worcestershire 

sauce, 

Have the butcher bone and roll the 
meat, dredge it well with salt, pep- 
per, and flour, and brown it on all 
sides in a frying-pan with a little of 
the fat from the meat, or one or two 
tablespoonfuls of beef drippings or 
pork fat. Put all the ingredients to- 
gether in a small cooker-pail, let it 
simmer thirty minutes, set it into a 
larger pail of boiling water and put 
into a cooker for nine hours or more. 
Reheat it to boiling point; strain and 
thicken the liquor for gravy. Round 
of beef may be used for pot roast, 
but it is drier than the rump, which 
has some fat on it. Four or five 
pounds of rump will make thi*ee 
pounds when boned. Have the bone 
sent from the market to use for soup 
stock. Serves ten or twelve persons. 
— Margaret J. Mitchell. 

Boiled Ham. 

If the ham is very salty soak it over 
night in cold water, put it into the 
pail in the morning, cover with cold 
water, put the lid on tightly, and 
bring to the boiling point. Cook ten 
minutes hard, then simmer for fifteen 
more, set it into tlie cooker, and leave 
it there over night. 



Chop Suey. 

1 quart lean pork and chicken, 
1 onion, 

1 pint celery, 

2 tablespoonfuls cornstarch, 
2 tablespoonfuls molasses, 
IJ teaspoonfuls salt, 

1 tablespoonful China soy, 
i cupful fresh mushrooms. 

Cut the pork and chicken into 
small pieces, put any bones that re- 
main in a cheese-cloth bag, tie it up 
and drop in pail of cooker. Cover 
with cold water and let it come very 
slowly to the boil. Fry out a piece 
of fat, salt pork in a spider, and 
brown the meat. Add it to the water 
in the pail, also the onion, the celery 
cut in inch lengths, bring to the boil- 
ing point, then simmer slowly for 
one hour. Dissolve the cornstarch in 
a little water and stir it in. Add 
the molasses, salt, and soy. Cook 
ten minutes longer, set the pail, 
tightly covered, into the cooker; leave 
it there eight hours. When served, 
lift out the cheese-cloth bag with 
the bones. Serve chop suey with 
boiled rice, Saratoga chips, and toast. 

Boiled Dinner. 

2 pounds lean salt pork, or corned 
beef, if preferred, 

3 turnips, 

4 beets, 

2 carrots, 

1 head cabbage, 

12 potatoes, 

i teaspoonful pepper, 

Water to cover. 

Wash the pork and gash it in slices; 
wash and pare the vegetables. If 
preferred, the beets may be cooked 
separately, without paring them. 
Put all, except the potatoes, into the 
cooker-pail and cover them with boil- 
ing water, ^^^^en boiling let them 
cook ten minutes on the stove, then 
put the pail into the cooker for six 
hours or more. Add the potatoes, re- 
heat it to boiling poinl, and replace 
it in the cooker for two hours. If 
more salt or pepper is required add 
it when the potatoes are put in. In 
order to save time the potatoes may

be cooked separately, drained, and 
added to the dinner before bringing 
it to a boil for serving. Serves eight 
or ten persons. — Margaret J. Mit- 
cheU. 

Steamed Pudding. 

J cupful chopped suet, 

i cupful flour, 

1 teaspoonful cinnamon, 

1 teaspoonful mace, 

i teaspoonful salt, 

i teaspoonful cloves, 

^ pound Sultana raisins, 

i pound currants, 

rt pound citron, 

i cupful sugar, 

1^ cupfuls soft bread crumbs, 

3 eggs, 

i cupful milk. 

Chop the suet fine, mix with the 
flour and spices, then add the fruit, 



sugar, and bread crumbs. "Wet with 
the milk and eggs, stir hard, and 
turn the mixture into a greased 
mold. Set it into the pail of the 
cooker. Surround with boiling water, 
give it one hour on the stove and 
all night in the cooker. 

Stewed Prunes. 

1 pound prunes, 
^ cupful sugar, 
3 cupfuls water. 

Wash the prunes thoroughly, soak 
for several hours or over night. Cook 
on top of the stove fifteen minutes 
in the same water in which they were 
soaked; then remove to the pail of 
the cooker, and cook four hours. 
Cover tightly. Add sugar before 
serving. 



CHAPTER XXXVIII 
INFECTION AND DISINFECTION 

CONTACT INFECTION — DISINFECTION — STANDARD SOLUTIONS 
— FUMIGATION OR GASEOUS DISINFECTION — FORMALDE- 
HYDE AND SULPHUR FUMIGATION — ADDITIONAL DISIN- 
FECTION 



CONTACT INFECTION 

Before the germ theory of disease 
became fully established, a distinction 
was made between what were called 
" infectious " as opposed to " conta- 
gious " diseases. These words are 
now used interchangeably. It was 
formerly supposed that " infectious " 
diseases could be " caught " by merely 
breathing the air in the vicinity of the 
patient. A superstition to this ef- 
fect still lingers in some localities. 
Many persons, otherwise well in- 
formed, attempt to hold their breath 
while passing pest houses or dwell- 
ings where patients with virulent 
communicable diseases are quaran- 
tined. This notion that the germs of 
disease are usually communicated 
through the air has been completely 
exploded. On the other hand it was 
formerly supposed that " contagious " 
in the sense opposed to " infectious " 
diseases, could be communicated only 
by actual contact of the diseased 
part with the body of another person. 
Some diseases were thought to be 
both contagious and infectious. Many 
cases of the transmission of disease 
were observed, however, which could 
not be explained upon either of these 
theories. Hence there was formerly 
a good deal of doubt, even among 
medical men, as to the exact way in 
which certain diseases were communi- 
cated. 

This confusion of thought is now to 
a large extent cleared away. The 



543 



contact infection theory may be said 
to be fully established. According 
to this theory the living bacteria, or 
germs, which cause contagious dis- 
eases are most commonly transmitted 
from a diseased to a well person 
within a comparatively short space 
of time, and through the medium of 
some solid object or liquid, rather 
than through the air. Two kinds, or 
types, of infection are loosely distin- 
guished — direct and secondary. Di- 
rect infection is, in general, that which 
gives rise to new cases in families or 
on premises that have been previously 
free from disease. Indirect, or sec- 
ondary, infection is that whereby a 
disease is communicated from a pa- 
tient to his nurse or other attendant, 
or to other members of the 
same household. Direct infection is 
thought to occur chiefly through the 
contamination of the sources of water 
or milk supply, or by chance contact 
with persons in the early stages of a 
communicable disease, or those suf- 
fering from mild cases, or from 
healthy " carriers." Especial attention 
has also been directed of late to the 
part played by insects, especially the 
house fly, as carriers of disease. The 
bedbug, the body louse, the various 
species of fleas, mosquito and ticks 
have also been found to communicate 
the germs of disease from certain ani- 
mals to man and from one person to 
another. 

Direct infection may, and often 
does, occur from unavoidable acci-

dent. But secondary infection is in- 
variably the result of ignorance or 
carelessness. The most usual vehicles 
of secondary infection are thought to 
be the bed covers or clothing of the 
patient; his handkerchief; his dis- 
charges; remnants of food and drink 
left by him on the tray, or the dishes 
or other utensils by means of which 
he is served; and the person or 
clothing of the nurse or other bed- 
side visitors. The cardinal principle 
of preventive medicine is that sec- 
ondary infection must and shall not 
occur. • 

According to the contact infection 
theory all the germs of disease by 
which healthy persons are infected 
had quite recent origin in the body 
of some diseased person. They left 
the patient through some of his dis- 
charges, as his sputum or excreta, 
possibly through perspiration, or in 
the case of smallpox, chickenpox, or 
scarlet fever, through the scabs or 
scaling of the outer surface of the 
body. Thence they were transmitted 
to the neighborhood of the infected 
person, through some fairly direct 
route, by the agency of solid bodies or 
liquids, and under conditions reason- 
ably favorable to germ life. They 
then found their entrance into his 
body through some of its main ori- 
fices, usually by being breathed in or 
swallowed. When these essential 
principles are well understood and 
sufficiently considered, they will usu- 
ally enable the responsible head of a 
family to trace a case of infection to 
its source. Steps may then be taken 
to avoid further infection and prevent 
the spread of the disease. 

The open vault, sink drain, or ac- 
cumulation of garbage or other filth, 
so located as to contaminate the soil 
or the sources of the water supply, 
and the flies or other insects which 
feed in and about them, may be com- 
pared to an unloaded gun. Their 
deadly possibilities are latent until 
they become infested (loaded) with 
the living germs of typhoid or other 
communicable diseases. Such germs 
are not the product of putrefaction. 
They do not develop spontaneously 
in fecal or decayed matter such as 
night-soil, garbage, and kitchen slops. 



Nor do disease germs multiply in such 
locations. Indeed, the bacteria which 
cause human diseases will ordinarily 
die out within a comparatively short 
time when deliberately added to such 
substances for the purpose of scien- 
tific investigation. When a case of 
typhoid or other contagious disease 
occurs, through the pollution of the 
soil or water supply, or through the 
medium of flies, by contagion from 
an open vault or drain or similar nuis- 
ance, the real source is often over- 
looked and disregarded, because these 
nuisances have existed before the pa- 
tient was taken sick and no one had 
previously been made ill by them. The 
explanation of science is that only at 
rare intervals and as a consequence of 
direct infection from some diseased 
person, do these nuisances become ac- 
tive sources of contagion and deadly 
menaces to the public health. The 
danger is that this may happen un- 
known to the responsible head of the 
family. The result may be an epi- 
demic in which many lives are need- 
lessly sacrificed. 

A good illustration may be found in 
a case reported by a milk inspector 
of a western city. An outbreak of 
typhoid was traced to the milk sup- 
.])ly from a certain farm dairy. On 
investigation it was found that two of 
the dairyman's children were con- 
valescing from that disease. The 
family water supply used for drink- 
ing purposes and also for cleansing 
milk pails and other receptacles was 
a dug well in the farmer's yard. It 
was located not far from an outhouse 
of the o])en vault type. The milk in- 
spector suggested that the well water 
might be contaminated from this 
source. The dairyman responded that 
this could not be the case because the 
water was clear, cold and tasteless. 
A few days later this farmer called up 
the milk inspector on the telephone 
and required if the germs of typhoid 
fever would make water pink. The 
inspector responded. No ! but that if 
the well water was pink, it might be 
due to a quantity of red dye which he 
had poured into the vault of the out- 
house. Later, the dairyman himself 
succumbed to tyjjhoid fever. The 
milk supply from this dairy having 



INFECTION AND DISINFECTION 



645 



been shut off, further spread of the 
disease among its patrons was pre- 
vented. 

A practical suggestion may be 
drawn from this incident for cases 
where it is suspected that the source 
of drinking water may be contami- 
nated from open vaults, drains or 
similar sources. A bushel or more of 
coarse salt may be deposited in the 
vault or drain and care taken to ob- 
serve whether or not the water, espe- 
cially after the next heavy rain, tastes 
in the least salty. 

But, as the amount of salt that 
might be transmitted in solution 
through the soil may not be enough 
to be detected when diluted by the 
contents of a deep well, it is safer 
and better in all such cases to have 
a bacteriological test of the water 
made at the State laboratory. The 
commissioner of health in most States 
will forward on request a suitable 
bottle properly packed for mailing, 
with full directions how to select and 
forward the necessary sample. In 
some States such tests will be made 
free. But in any case the cost will 
hardly exceed that of a doctor's visit. 
The result may be the saving of one 
or many lives. 

The bacteria which cause germ dis- 
eases are parasites, that is, they do 
not normally occur in nature outside 
the bodies of men or other animals. 
These they regard as their natural 
home. Hence they can thrive and 
multiply only under very similar con- 
ditions of warmth, moisture, absence 
of direct sunlight and presence of a 
supply of food suitable to their 
necessities. They are so exceedingly 
small as to be totally invisible to the 
naked eye, and are without color, taste 
or odor. Hence the presence in an 
ordinary well of bacteria sufficient to 
kill all the inhabitants of a great city 
could not be detected without the use 
of a microscope except through their 
fatal consequences. 

It was formerly supposed that the 
lntroducti(5n into the human body of 
one or more germs of any contagious 
ailment was certain to result in the 
contraction of a typical case of the 
disease. The use of the microscope 
has proved that this is by no means 



the case. The germs of pneumonia, 
diphtheria, tuberculosis and others are 
often found in the throat and lungs of 
perfectly healthy persons. The germs 
of various diseases may be swallowed 
without injurious results. The likeli- 
hood of contagion depends in part 
upon the number of the bacteria that 
may gain lodgment in the system, in 
part upon their vitality, and in part 
upon the state of health of the infected 
person. Most germs tend to breed 
and multiply in colonies. They do 
not live long outside of the human 
body, or other living host, except un- 
der favorable conditions, and the body 
when in perfect health has consider- 
able power to resist their invasion. 

The vitality of different species, or 
of the same species under different 
conditions, varies considerably. The 
germ which causes consumption, the 
tubercle bacillus, is among the most 
resistant. The germs expectorated by 
the consumptive may be found in a 
state of full vitality. In the dry 
sputum of the patient, floating in the 
air as dust. With this exception, 
however, it is believed that exposure 
to dry heat and especially to direct 
sunlight kills most disease germs or 
greatly weakens them. The effect of 
cold is merely to suspend their activi- 
ties. Freezing for an indefinite time 
does not injure most germs. But all 
are destroyed by exposure to heat at 
or near the temperature of boiling wa- 
ter, or by contact with various sub- 
stances known as germicides or disin- 
fectants. 

The most virulent bacteria will die 
of themselves within a comparatively 
short time after they are thrown off 
from the body of a diseased person, 
unless by chance they find congenial 
lodgment in warm, dark places such 
as open vaults or drains or in another 
human body. 

The germs of diphtheria, typhoid 
and some other diseases will multiply 
quite rapidly in fresh milk, although 
they are commonly destroyed by the 
lactic acid which forms in milk in the 
process of souring. They will, how- 
ever, live for some time in cheese and 
butter. Hence contamination of the 
milk supply is one of the most fre- 
quent sources of infection. Bacteria 



546 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



I 



do not appear to multiply in ordinary 
drinking water. On the contrary, it 
is believed that the germs of typhoid 
will die out of wells and cisterns in 
about a week or ten days if there is no 
further contamination in that interval. 
The contamination of water supplies 
is, however, among the most frequent 
causes of fatal epidemics of typhoid 
and some other diseases. The pollu- 
tion is usually continuous and often in- 
creases in amount and virulence until 
attention is drawn to it by an out- 
break of disease. 

The discharges of patients suffer- 
ing from typhoid and similar dis- 
eases contain myriads of the living 
bacteria. When these find their way 
by seepage, or surface drainage from 
open vaults to streams, springs, wells 
and cisterns, or through the outflows 
of sewage being in too close proximity 
to the intake of water supplies, the 
numjber of germs swallowed is almost 
sure to bring on the disease in its most 
virulent form. 

Other common sources of infection 
are vegetables, contaminated by pol- 
luted soil, pet cats and other animals, 
and, in short, anything which may 
serve as a vehicle to transport the 
living germs in a fairly direct route 
from one human body to another. 

While a person in perfect health 
may come in contact with the germs 
of disease with impunity, especially 
if they are few in number, and if their 
vitality has been impaired by expos- 
ure to drying heat or otherwise, yet 
every precaution that science can sug- 
gest should be taken to avoid such 
contagion. Persons in the best of 
health may become susceptible to the 
attacks of bacteria by the lowering of 
tone due to over-fatigue, to a sudden 
cold, or similar causes. Or the dis- 
ease may be taken in such mild form 
that its true character may not be rec- 
ognized. Such an attack may cause 
the patient little inconvenience, but 
may result, in the absence of proper 
precautions, in the spread of the dis- 
ease to others in its most virulent 
form. Indeed, such cases, and those 
called healthy " carriers " are known 
to be among the most common 
agencies in the spread of epidemics. 

Healthy " carriers " of disease, in 



medical parlance, are patients who 
have recovered and become immune 
to the bacteria of a germ disease, but 
who are still breeding such germs in 
large numbers in their bodies. Or- 
dinarily, the germs of disease disap- 
pear at or near the time of the pa- 
tient's recovery, but in exceptional 
cases persons have been known to be 
" carriers " for many months or even 
years. Such persons are especially 
dangerous, because the liability of in- 
fection from them is not usually sus- 
pected. Yet, in the absence of ab- 
solute cleanliness and proper precau- 
tionary measures, they may be the 
means of infecting others, or contami- 
nating sources of water supply. A 
typical case is that known to medi- 
cal men as " Typhoid Mary." This 
woman is known to have infected 
about twenty-four persons in six dif- 
ferent families where she was em- 
ployed as a cook. Another recorded 
instance is that of a dairyman, a 
carrier of typhoid, who caused no 
fewer than three epidemics in a west- 
ern city through the contamination of 
the water supply which was used by 
hira for cleansing milk cans and other 
receptacles. 

Prevention of Contact Infection. — 
There are two distinct lines of action 
which must be adopted to insure 
against infection. The first consists 
in preventing all possibility of the con- 
tamination of the soil, pollution of 
water supply, or transmission of the 
germs of disease by flies and other 
insects. This may be done by abolish- 
ing all open vaults and drains and by 
the sanitary disposition of all slops, 
garbage, dead animals and other 
household or farm refuse. Statistics 
show that such steps, if properly 
taken, will reduce the likelihood of 
infection about one-half. Thus, in the 
city of Springfield, 111., the death rate 
from typhoid continued to increase 
even after the introduction of an ef- 
ficient water supply and sanitary 
sewerage. An investigation by the 
Board of Health disclosed that only 
about one-third of the property own- 
ers were availing themselves of these 
improvements. Two-thirds of the 
families were still dependent upon 
cess-pools and open vaults. When 



INFECTION AND DISINFECTION 



5¥! 



these were abolished by city ordinance, 
the death rate from typhoid was re- 
duced about one-half. A similar re- 
sult was observed in the city of Provi- 
dence after all cess-pools and open 
vaults were abolished by municipal or- 
dinance. 

The other line of defense consists 
in tlie observance of absolute sanitary 
cleanliness and the proper use of dis- 
infectants, especially in times of epi- 
demic or when there are cases of con- 
tagious illness in the family or neigh- 
borhood. It has been proved beyond 
question that, if proper precautions 
are taken to avoid infection from milk 
or water supplies, insects and similar 
causes, and if sanitary precautions are 
observed, a patient with any contagi- 
ous disease may be nursed in his own 
home without infecting other members 
of the family. In certain high-class 
French hospitals, patients suffering 
from all sorts of contagious diseases, 
such as diphtheria, smallpox, typhoid 
fever, scarlet fever and others, are 
treated in the same open wards and 
waited upon by the same physicians, 
nurses and attendants. The only 
separation of one patient from an- 
other is by means of low screens or 
partitions made of cotton cloth. Even 
these are sometimes omitted and the 
space allotted to each patient is de- 
fijied merely by a line of tape or by 
marks chalked or painted upon the 
floor. The object of these is simply 
to call the nurse's attention to the 
necessity of observing sanitary pre- 
cautions before crossing the terri- 
tory of one patient into that of an- 
other. 

No object which has touched the per- 
son of a patient or been contaminated 
by any of his discharges is permitted 
to touch the person of any other pa- 
tient. The nurse and the attending 
physicians wash their hands in a dis- 
infectant solution each time they touch 
or handle the patient or anything 
which has come into contact with him, 
before approaching the bedside of an- 
other sufferer. Under this plan, 
which is known as the French cubicle 
system, instances in which a patient 
suffering from one contagious disease 
has become infected with another are 
extremely rare, while all are being 



treated in the same room and are 
breathing the same air. 

DISINFECTION 

The purpose of disinfection is to 
kill the germs of contagious diseases 
after they leave the body of the pa- 
tient and before they find another 
victim. This may be done by means 
of heat by boiling, baking or burning 
the infected material, or by means of 
various chemical poisons known as dis- 
infectants or germicides. These are 
usually applied in liquid or gaseous 
form. Germs can be killed by heat or 
disinfectants only under the following 
conditions: The heat must be suf- 
ficiently intense or the disinfectant 
sufficiently strong; the germs must be 
thoroughly exposed to the heat or dis- 
infectant; and for a sufficient length 
of time. 

Disinfection by heat may be by 
fire, boiling water or live steam. No 
special apparatus is needed if fire or 
boiling water is used. The infected 
articles are simply burned or boiled. 
Articles to be disinfected by boiling 
should be weighted, if necessary, and 
kept under the water while actually 
boiling for not less than half an hour. 
The addition of common washing soda 
to the water, at the rate of one mod- 
erate tablespoonful to each gallon of 
water, increases its efficiency. 

Steam disinfection, on a small 
scale, may be accomplished by means 
of an ordinary wash boiler contain- 
ing a wooden rack resting upon 
bricks, or otherwise suspended above 
the level of the boiling water. Pack 
the articles to be disinfected closely 
upon this rack, put the cover on 
tight and boil briskly at least an 
hour. Be sure to use enough water 
so that the boiler will not go dry. 
Many kinds of clothing and other ob- 
jects which would be injured by boil- 
ing can be safely disinfected in this 
manner. 

All stains should be removed be- 
fore disinfection by steam or boiling 
water, as heat tends to fix them. 

Disinfection in General. — Most of 
the so-called disinfection practiced in 
families is inefficient and useless. The 
burning of coffee, tar, or other sub- 



548 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



stances in the sick room or elsewhere 
in the presence of the patient or oth- 
ers, operates at most only as a deodor- 
izer. Such fumes do not destroy the 
germs of disease. Open vessels con- 
taining chloride of lime, carbolic acid 
or other disagreeable-smelling sub- 
stances have no value for disinfecting 
purposes, unless the infected material 
is actually immersed in them. If bad 
odors exist, remove the source and ad- 
mit an abundance of fresh air. Never 
use disinfectants not vouched for by 
reliable authorities. Disinfectants, 
germ killers, and the like, sold like 
patent medicines, are most often ex- 
pensive and worthless. They should 
never be relied upon. The following 
solutions are for use during illness 
and for general family use as di- 
rected. 

Allow nothing to go from the sick 
room in case of communicable dis- 
eases without having been disinfected 
with one of these solutions. It should 
be an unceasing duty of the nurse or 
other attendants to see that disinfec- 
tion as here indicated is carried out to 
the minutest particular. 

STANDARD DISINFECTANT SOLU- 
TIONS 

Substances recommended as reli- 
able disinfectants for general exter- 
nal use in contagious diseases are (1) 
chloride of lime; (2) quick lime; milk 
of lime; (3) bichloride of mercury 
(corrosive sublimate), either with or 
without the addition of muriate of 
ammonia, or permanganate of pot- 
ash; (4) carbolic acid, and (5) solu- 
tion of formaldehyde (formalin). 
Such substances as Lysol, Kreolin, 
Tri-Kresol and other much advertised 
patented preparations are no better 
than the above and are too expensive 
for general external use in sufficient 
quantities. The following standard 
disinfectant solutions are those en- 
dorsed and recommended by public 
health authorities throughout the 
United States. They are the cheap- 
est, best known and most reliable dis- 
infectants. No others need be em- 
ployed for general external use. 
Most of these solutions are highly poi- 
sonous. None are suitable for wash- 



ing out the mouth, gargling the throat, 
or other internal use. 

No. 1. Standard Solution of Chlo- 
ride of Lime (chlorinated lime). — 
This is one of the most effective and 
highly recommended disinfectants. It 
is used in the form of an aqueous 
solution, i. e., dissolved in water, in 
strength varying from 3 per cent 
(weak) to 10 per cent (strong) solu- 
tion. For a ]0 jier cent solution add 
1 pound of good chloride of lime to 
1 gallon of water and mix thoroughly. 
For a 5 per cent solution use i pound 
to the gallon of water, and for a 3 
per cent solution use 1 pound to 3 
gallons or 5i ounces to the gallon. 
^Authorities variously recommend from 
Hi to 6i ounces chloride of lime to the 
gallon of water, or a solution of 
slightly moi'e than 3 per cent, as a 
standard solution for free general use. 

Chloride of lime is not fully soluble 
in water. A clear solution may be 
obtained by filtration or decantation, 
but the insoluble sediment does no 
harm and this is an unnecessary re- 
finement. The solution should stand 
at least ten minutes before using. 

The chloride of lime must be of the 
best quality. It should contain at 
least 25 per cent of available chlo- 
rine. Poor chloride of lime is use- 
less. Prepare only as needed and 
keep, preferably, in a stone jug with 
a tight-fitting "stopper. Do not de- 
pend upon this solution unless freshly 
prepared from chloride of lime of 
good quality. This substance ought 
to be obtained anywhere for about 
10 cents a pound retail or about 3^ 
cents wholesale, making the cost of 
a 3 per cent solution only about 1 
to 3 cents a gallon. Hence, in addi- 
tion to being among the most effec- 
tive disinfectants and germicides 
available for general use, it is also 
one of the cheapest. 

Directions for Use. — Use one quart 
of the half-strength (5 per cent) so- 
lution for each discharge from a pa- 
tient suffering from any contagious or 
infectious disease. Mix well and 
leave in the vessel for an hour or 
more before throwing into privy 
vault or water closet. The same for 
vomited matter. For a very copious 
discharge, especially in cholera, use a 



I 



INFECTION AND DISINFECTION 



649 



larger quantity; and for solid or semi- 
solid matter, use the full strength 
(10 per cent) solution. Receive dis- 
charges from the mouth or throat in 
a cup half full of the half-strength 
(5 per cent) solution, and those from 
the nostrils upon soft cotton or linen 
rags. Burn these immediately. 

As the fecal discharges of the sick 
are the chief vehicles of communica- 
tion in many contagious diseases, 
their disinfection should be thorough- 
ly performed. Especially should care 
be taken as to their disposal, so that 
no portion of them can gain access, 
either directly or indirectly, by sur- 
face drainage, percolation, filtration, 
or otherwise, to any water-supply. 

Use a quart or more of the solu- 
tion full-strength (10 per cent) each 
day in an offensive vault, and such 
quantities as may be necessary in 
other places. Use it in a sprinkler 
in stables, and elsewhere. In the 
sick room place it in vessels, cuspi- 
dors, etc. Immerse sheets and other 
clothing used by the patient in a pail 
or tub of this solution, diluted one 
gallon of the full-strength (10 per 
cent) solution to ten of water, for 
two hours, or until ready for the wash 
room or laundry. This solution is 
non-poisonous and does not injure 
white clothing. It should be used, 
however, only for white, cotton or 
linen fabrics. It bleaches colored 
goods and injures wool, silk and other 
animal fibers. Body and bed linen 
thus treated should afterwards be 
thoroughly cleansed by boiling for a 
half liour in soap and water and by 
two or more rinsings. 

It may also be used in one-third 
strength (3 per cent) solution for 
washing the hands or parts of the 
body which may have been exposed 
to infection from excreta, etc. 

For a free and general use in prl\y- 
vaults, sewers, sink drains, refuse 
heaps, stables, and wherever else the 
odor of the disinfectant is not objec- 
tionable, this is perhaps the cheapest 
and most effective disinfectant and 
germicide available for general use. 
It should be used so freely as to wet 
everything required to be disinfected. 
Its odor does not disinfect. It only 
covers up other odors. 



Chloride of Lime in dry form may 
also be applied in large quantities to 
vaults and cess-pools. Dilute it for 
this purpose with 9 parts of plaster of 
Paris or the same proportion of clean 
dry sand to admit of more convenient 
application. 

No. 2. Standard Solution Milk of 
Lime (quick lime). — Slake a quart 
of freshly-burnt lime (in small pieces) 
with I of a quart of water — or to be 
exact, 60 parts of water (by weight) 
with 100 of lime. A dry product of 
slaked lime (hydrate of lime) results. 
Make from this, milk of lime, im- 
mediately before it is to be used, by 
mixing 1 part of this dry hydrate of 
lime with 8 parts (by weight) of 
water. The dry hydrate may be pre- 
served for some time if enclosed in a 
covered fruit jar or other air-tight 
container. 

Or, prepare milk of lime by slaking 
freshly burnt quick lime in about four 
times its volume of water, i. e., about 
1 pound of fresh unslaked lime to 1 
gallon of water. Milk of lime must 
be used within a day or two after 
preparation or its value as a disin- 
fectant is lost. It should be kept in 
some air-tight container, preferably 
an earthenware jug and closely stop- 
pered. 

Air-slaked lime has no value as a 
disinfectant and should not be used 
for this purpose. 

Quick lime is one of the cheapest 
of disinfectants, and may take the 
place of chloride of lime if desired. 
Use freely in a quantity eqiial in 
amount to the material to be disin- 
fected. Use also to whitewash ex- 
posed surfaces, to disinfect excreta 
in the sick room, or on the surface 
of the ground, in sinks, vaults, drains, 
stagnant pools and the like. 

No. 3. Standard Solution of Bi- 
chloride of Mercury (corrosive sub- 
limate). — The most convenient way 
to prepare this solution is by the use 
of Trichloride of mercury tablets 
which can be obtained at any drug 
store. The directions for using these 
tablets are given on the package. But 
if large quantities of bichloride solu- 
tions are to be used, it will be found 
cheaper to have a strong solution jire- 
pared by a druggist and then add at 



650 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



home, under his direction, sufficient 
water to reduce it to tiie required 
strength. Two tablets dissolved in 1 
pint of water, or sixteen tablets {-2 
drains) corrosive sublimate to the gal- 
lon, makes a solution of 1 to 500. This 
may be improved by adding 2 ounces 
of common salt to the gallon of water. 

Or, dissolve corrosive sublimate 
and muriate of ammonia in water in 
the proportion of 2 drams, 1^0 grains 
or i ounce of each to the gallon. 

Or, dissolve corrosive sublimate and 
permanganate of potash, 2 drams each 
to 1 gallon of water. 

Or, dissolve corrosive sublimate, 
permanganate of potash and muriate 
of ammonia in pure soft water in the 
proportion of 2 drams each to the 
gallon. 

All the above substances may be 
obtained at any first-class drug store. 
The simple solution of bichloride in 
water first mentioned is a good dis- 
infectant and may be preferred 
whenever it is necessary to practice 
economy. But, if the additional cost 
of such substances as muriate of 
ammonia (sal ammoniac) and per- 
manganate of potash can be afforded, 
the solution will be more efficient 
and will keep better. If permanga- 
nate of potash is not used, it is a 
good plan to add a little blue vitriol 
or common bluing to color the solu- 
tion. This lessens the danger of its 
being swallowed by accident. 

Cautions. — All the above solutions 
or others containing bichloride of 
mercury (corrosive subUmate) will 
corrode metals and even tarnisli gold. 
In so doing their disinfecting power 
is lost. Hence, these solutions must 
be mixed in a wooden tub, barrel or 
pail, or an earthen crock. They 
must be kept in a glass or earthen- 
ware receptacle — as a glass fruit jar 
or earthenware jug — tightly stop- 
pered to prevent evaporation, and la- 
beled " Poison." They should never 
be poured into metal drains without 
thorough and repeated flushing. Oth- 
erwise they will injure plumbing. 
Nor shoidd thoy be permitted to come 
into contact with the metal fixtures 
of the bath room. The better plan is 
to bury them, after using, at least one 
foot deeji in the ground. Rings must 



be removed from the hands before 
they are immersed in the bichloride 
solutions. 

Use any of the above solutions full 
strength (1:500) to disinfect ex- 
creta in the same manner and quan- 
tity as the Chloride of Lime Solution 
No. 1. They are equally as effective 
but slower in action. Hence it is 
necessary to let the mixture, disin- 
fectant and infected matter, stand at 
least four hours. It is best to empty 
the mixture into a wooden pail and 
leave it for twenty-four hours. It 
may then be thrown into a vault or 
buried. The chief advantage of these 
solutions over No. 1 is that they pos- 
sess no odor. Hence they may be 
preferred for use in vessels, cusj)idors 
and the like, if Solution No. 1 is 
objectionable on account of its smell. 
They are not as good disinfectants 
for vaults, sinli drains, sewers and 
the like as the chloride of lime so- 
lution, nor are they trustworthy as a 
disinfectant of fresh sputum. 

Also use any of these solutions 
one-half strength, that is, diluted with 
an equal quantity of water (I : 1,000), 
for the disinfection of soiled un- 
derclothing, bed linen and other 
fabrics. IMix the solution well by stir- 
ring and immerse the articles for two 
hours. Then wring them out and boll 
at least half an hour. Bichloride solu- 
tions tend to fix stains. Hence re- 
move stains by appropriate process be- 
fore disinfection. 

Also use one-half strength (1 : 
1,000) of any of these solutions for 
washing all hard surfaces not metal- 
lic, as walls, floors, furniture and the 
like, and for moistening cloths with 
which to wipe off dust from tlie 
woodwork and furniture. For wash- 
ing metallic surfaces use disinfectant 
No. 5, 2 per cent solution of formal- 
dehyde. 

Also use this solution one-half 
strength (1 : 1,000) for washing the 
hands and general body surfaces of 
the attendants and convalescents — 
the latter, however, only by direction 
of the physician. 

Bichloride of mercury, either in 
solid form or in mixtures is a vio- 
lent corrosive poison. One ounce of 
any of the above solutions, full 



INFECTION AND DISINFECTION 



551 



strength, contains nearly a grain of 
corrosive sublimate and will inevitably 
cause death by poison if swallowed. 
Hence all these solutions must be la- 
beled " Poison " and kept out of reach 
of children. Their use should always 
be under the direction of some intelli- 
gent person. 

Antidote. — If by accident one of 
these solutions is swallowed, send for 
a physician at once. Do not wait, 
however, until he arrives. Give the 
proper antidote quickly. Give freelj'^ 
white of egg mixed with water, or if 
this is not at hand, give wheat flour 
mixed with water, or give milk. Try 
to provoke vomiting so as to empty 
the stomach. For this purpose give 
mustard and water, or salt and 
water, or tickle the back of the 
throat. 

No, 4, Standard Solution of Car- 
bolic Acid. — Carbolic acid is one of 
the most generally useful disinfect- 
ants in the sick room, but is rather 
expensive when properly used and its 
odor is objectionable to some persons. 
Carbolic acid may be used dissolved 
in water in a strength from a 2 per 
cent (weak) to a 5 per cent (strong) 
solution. For a 5 per cent solution 
add 1 pint or pound of either the 
crude or purified liquid carbolic acid 
to 2i gallons of hot water, or about 
6 ounces to the gallon. Stir frequently 
until no red or colorless droplets re- 
main in the bottom of the mixture. 
The keeping power and efficiency of 
this solution may be increased by the 
addition of 12 to 14 ounces of com- 
mon salt to each gallon, when used for 
the disinfection of excreta or other 
uses where the salt is not objection- 
able. Use this 5 per cent solution in 
the same way and for the same pur- 
poses as Standard Solution No. 1 of 
Chloride of Lime. 

Use one-half strength, i. e., diluted 
in an equal quantity of water {2i per 
cent solution) for the tub in which 
body or bed linen is immersed. Also 
for washing woodwork, floors and 
other hard surfaces and for the hands 
and person. Immerse fabrics four 
hours, then rinse and boil for half 
an hour. 

Antidote. — Carbolic acid, like bi- 
chloride of mercury, is a violent cor- 



rosive poison. Hence take great care 
to see that it is properly labeled and 
kept out of reach of children. In 
case of poisoning send for a physi- 
cian at once, but do not wait until 
he arrives. Diluted alcohol is the 
best antidote. Give this in the form 
of whiskey, brandy or cologne water, 
if pure alcohol is not at hand. Do 
not use wood alcohol, which is itself 
poisonous. Epsom salts or glauber 
salts, in doses of one tablespoonful, 
rank next to alcohol as antidotes. All 
cases, however, require the immediate 
attendance of a physician. Olive oil, 
castor oil and glycerine are also anti- 
dotes for carbolic acid. Try to pro- 
voke vomiting so as to empty the 
stomach. For this purpose give mus- 
tard and water, salt and water or 
tickle the back of the throat. 

Pure carbolic acid will burn the 
skin. Should an accident of this kind 
happen, immediately apply grain (not 
wood) alcohol, whiskey, brandy or 
cologne water. 

No. 5. Standard Solution of For- 
maldehyde (formalin). — Dissolve 12 
ounces 40 per cent solution of formal- 
dehyde (formalin) in 1 gallon pure 
soft water. This mixture contains 6^ 
per cent of formaldehyde. It should 
be kept in tightly corked bottles to 
prevent loss of strength by evapora- 
tion of the gas. This solution, while 
somewhat more expensive, is prefera- 
ble for the disinfection of clothing and 
other fabrics, since it does not bleach 
or injure them. Use full strength for 
cuspidors, vessels and sputum cups in 
the sick room. Dilute one-half for 
the tub in which fabrics are immersed 
and for washing floors, woodwork and 
the like. It is especially recommended 
for washing furniture, woodwork and 
metallic surfaces and for washing the 
hands and person of both nurse and 
patient. 

Formaldehyde is a gas. It is sold 
in a solution containing 40 per cent of 
formaldehyde cither under the simple 
designation, " Forty per cent solution 
of formaldehyde," or under the pro- 
prietary designations, " Formalin " 
and "Formal"; always ask for "for- 
maldehyde " else you may pay extra 
for the same thing. For disinfecting, 
it may be used either in solution or 



552 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



in gaseous form. In household dis- 
infection it is generally used as a gas. 
Formaldehyde tends to fix stains. 
Hence they should be removed by ap- 
propriate i)roces8es before disinfec- 
tion. Formaldehyde in gaseous form 
does not injure even the most deli- 
cate fabrics. It has a slightly cor- 
rosive action on polished steel, but 
does not afifect other metals. 

Antidote. — If by chance formalde- 
hyde solution is swallowed, give at 
once one to two tablespoonfuls of so- 
lution of acetate of ammonia (spirit 
of mindererus), or one teaspoonful of 
aromatic S2Jirits of ammonia, diluted 
with water; or 10 to ;^0 drops of ordi- 
nary ammonia, well diluted with cold 
w'ater. Send for a physician at once. 
The doses stated are for adults. The 
dose for children must be in propor- 
tion to their age. But none of the 
antidotes mentioned are poisonous, 
and they can be given in any approxi- 
mately correct quantity without fear. 

FUMIGATION OR GASEOUS DISIN- 
FECTION 

Preparations. — The sick room in 
all cases and preferably every room 
in the house, especially in case of 
smallpox, diphtheria, typhoid and 
other virulent diseases, should be 
thoroughly disinfected by fumigation. 
This may be accomplished by formal- 
dehyde gas or by the fumes of burn- 
ing sulphur. During convalescence 
following cases of scarlet fever, small- 
pox or measles, the body of the patient 
should be daily rubbed with vaseline 
to prevent scales and dry particles of 
dead skin from being carried by air 
currents, ^\^len sufficiently recovered, 
the patient should have a warm bath 
every day until the skin has ceased to 
peel. When the patient leaves the 
sick room he should be given a disin- 
fectant bath in Standard Solution No. 
3 or No. 5 (bichloride 1:1,000 or for- 
maldehyde 2 per cent). This should 
be followed by a cleansing bath in- 
cluding a shamjioo or thorough wash- 
ing of the hair and scalp. The pa- 
tient should then he dressed in clean 
garments and should not again enter 
the infected room until it has been dis- 
infected and cleansed. The nurse or 



attendant should exercise the same 
precautions against spreading the in- 
fection. After the room has been va- 
cated by the patient and nurse it is 
ready for final disinfection. This 
should be done preferably by a duly 
qualified officer of the Board of Health, 
ijut may be done successfully by any 
one if the following directions are 
carefully observed. 

Fumigation by Formaldehyde. — 
First send to the drug store for the 
necessary materials. To ascertain the 
quantity required measure the room 
and find the length, breadth and 
height in feet. Multiply the fig- 
ures together, disregarding fractions. 
This gives the cubical contents of the 
room in feet. Divide by 1,000 (point 
off three places) to find the number 
of thousand cubic feet in the room. 
For example, a room 10 feet square 
and 10 feet high contains 1,000 cubic 
feet. Use 6f ounces crystals of po- 
tassium permanganate for each 1,000 
cubic feet of room space, or 10 
ounces when the temperature is be- 
low GO degrees F. Over these pour 
16 ounces of -10 per cent aqueous so- 
lution of formaldehyde (formalin) 
for each 1,000 cubic feet of room 
space, or 2-1 ounces when the tempera- 
ture is below 60 degrees F. 

Thoroughly seal the room from 
within so as to prevent the escape of 
the gas until disinfection has been 
accomplished. Carefully close all win- 
dows and doors except one door for 
exit. Leave the windows unlocked so 
that they may be opened from without. 
Securely paste wet strips of paper 
over all registers, transoms, keyholes 
and cracks above, beneath and at the 
sides of windows and doors, over stove 
holes and all openings in walls, ceil- 
ings and floor. Use several thick- 
nesses of paper if the openings are 
large. Gummed paper put uj) in rolls 
is made for this purpose. Or adhesive 
surgeon's plaster may be used. But 
common newspaper cut into narrow 
strips will do. It should be thoroughly 
wet with the Standard Solution No. 3 
or No. 5 (bichloride 1:500 or formal- 
dehyde 5 per cent), in order to disin- 
fect the surfaces upon which it is used. 
Soft soap may be used for pasting 
paper strips so that they may later be 



INFECTION AND DISINFECTION 



553 



easily washed off. Or use paperhang- 
er's ])aste, which may be prepared, and 
afterwards removed, by methods de- 
scribed elsewhere in tliis volume. 
After the strips are in place go over 
them on the outside with the brush 
dipped in the paste so as to wet them 
thoroughly. 

Stop up the fire place with a sheet 
of tin or zinc and paste strips of pa- 
per around the edges. Or securely 
paste large sheets of heavy wrapping 
paper over the opening so that tliey 
cannot be displaced by the draft. 
There must be no opening through 
which gas can escape. 

Now spread out on chairs, or 
clothes-racks, all articles that cannot 
be boiled. Clothing, bed covers and 
the like should be hung on a line 
stretched across the room. Open the 
mattresses and set them on edge. 
Stretch the window shades and cur- 
tains to their full length. Open the 
doors of closets or clothes-presses. 
Lift the lids of trunks or chests and 
remove and spread out their contents. 
Open one of the long seams of pil- 
lows so that the fumes can reach the 
feathers. Do not pile articles to- 
gether. Open books and spread out 
the leaves. In short, arrange the 
room and its contents so as to secure 
free access of gas to all parts and to 
every object. If the room has been 
projierly cleansed and ventilated dur- 
ing the course of the disease and es- 
pecially if it was stripped of carpets 
and unnecessary furniture when first 
set apart as a sick room, the difficul- 
ties of disinfection will be greatly re- 
duced. 

Humidity. — When all is in readi- 
ness make the air of the room damp. 
This is absolutely necessary for dis- 
infection either by sulphur or formal- 
dehyde. Dampness may be produced 
by boiling a quantity of water in a 
wash boiler on a gas or gasoline stove, 
by pouring boiling water from a tea 
kettle into a tub, or by pouring cold 
water onto hot bricks or stones, or 
dropping hot bricks or stones into 
vessels containing cold, or preferably 
hot water. Under no circumstances 
is efficient disinfection possible with- 
out in some way making the air of 
the room quite damp. The tempera- 



ture should be from 60 to 70 degrees 
F. or over, the higher the better, but 
there must not be any fire or exposed 
flame in the room. 

Formaldehyde Generators. — For- 
maldehyde is a gas which may be 
generated in large quantities by the 
addition of formaldehyde solution 
(formalin) to crystals of potassium 
permanganate in the right propor- 
tions. A number of patented genera- 
tors and processes for disinfection 
with formaldehyde have been placed 
upon the market. Many of these are 
inefficient and the use of any of them 
is an unnecessarj' expense. A home- 
made device equal to the best patent 
generator ever devised may be ar- 
ranged by means of a common wood 
or fiber wash tub, two or more ordi- 
nary red bricks and a tin or galva- 
nized iron pail, such as a common 
milk or water pail, having the seams 
rolled, not soldered. Place the tub 
in the middle of the room with the 
pail inside resting upon two or more 
bricks standing edgewise. Now fill 
the tub with water nearly but not 
quite up to the level of the top of the 
bricks and the generator is ready for 
use. If the bricks can be previously 
heated in a very hot oven and the 
water poured in at, or near the boil- 
ing point, so as to give off a quantity 
of steam, so nmch the better. 

Before the pail is put in place 
spread the potassium permanganate 
crystals evenly over the bottom. 
Meantime have in readiness wet strips 
of paper and paste, or adhesive plas- 
ter, with which to seal up the cracks 
of the door immediately on leaving 
the room. When everything is in 
readiness and the paU containing the 
permanganate crystals is in place, pour 
over them the formaldehyde solution. 
Leave the room and seal up the door 
on the outside as quickly as possible. 
The formaldehyde is promptly liber- 
ated in great quantities. Hence the 
necessity that all preparations be made 
in advance and that the operator leave 
the room at once on the combination 
of the two chemicals. Leave the roona 
closed for at least four hours. 

Quantities and Proportions. — Care 
must be taken not to put too much 
formaldehyde into a single container. 



554 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



I 



The reaction is violent and there is 
great effervescence and bubbling. If 
the rooms are large, as in the case of 
school rooms, pubUc halls and the like, 
more than one container should be 
used. 

The following quantities may be 
used safely in the containers recom- 
mended : 

10 or l;2-quart milk-pail. 
Formaldehyde, 16 oimces. 
Permanganate, 6'i ounces. 

14-quart milk-pail. 
Formaldehyde, 24< ounces. 
Permanganate, 10 ounces. 

A receptacle of ample capacity, not 
less than mentioned above, should al- 
ways be used, as otherwise, the effer- 
vescence resulting from the reaction 
between the two substances may 
carry the mixture, or some of it, over 
the sides of the receptacle and stahi 
the carpet or floor. As permanga- 
nate of potassium is liable to stain 
anything with which it comes into 
contact, use great care in handling it. 

Remember that the permanganate 
must always be put in before the for- 
maldehyde solution. 

Conservation of Heat, — If the 
bricks and water which are placed in 
the tub are cold, it is a good plan to 
set the tin pail snugly into a wooden 
or pulp bucket. Or wrap it tightly 
with several layers of asbestos paper. 
This is done to retain within the gen- 
erator the heat, which is very im- 
portant to the proper generation of 
the gas. If the bricks and water are 
hot this will not be necessary. 

Selection of Materials. — The chem- 
icals required for formaldehyde disin- 
fection are not expensive and the 
best quality should be obtained from 
a reliable dealer. Secure the highest 
grade 40 per cent aqueous solution of 
formaldehyde on the market. An in- 
ferior grade may fail to do its work 
and thus bring about unfortunate re- 
sults by giving a false sense of se- 
curity. The fine needle-shaped crys- 
tals of potassium permanganate are 
better than the rhomboid. See that 
you get this substance in crystals. 
Do not accept the dust which often 
contains impurities. Never use for- 



maldehyde candles. They are not re- 
liable. Do not rely upon advertised 
apparatus, disinfectants, and proc- 
esses. Nothing can be better or 
cheaper than the plan above set forth. 
Formaldehyde Solution. — The fair- 
ly rapid liberation of gas may be se- 
cured by sprinkling 40 per cent for- 
maldehyde solution over sheets hung 
in the room requiring disinfection and 
containing the articles to be disinfect- 
ed. One pint of formaldehyde should 
be used for every 1,000 cubic feet of 
air space in the apartment, if there is 
not too much opportunity for the es- 
cape of the gas through cracks, win- 
dows, doors, etc. If the gas can find 
easy escape, proportionately more of 
the solution must be used. Since by 
either the permanganate method or 
by the sheet method, formaldehyde 
gas is rapidly liberated, it is essen- 
tial that all preparations be made in 
advance for the operator to leave the 
room promptly. The door should be 
closed and sealed and the room left 
closed for not less than six hours, 
after which the door and windows may 
be opened and the room aired. 

The odor of formaldehyde, if it 
persists so as to be objectionable, can 
be removed, or at least moderated, by 
hanging up towels or sheets in the 
room and sprinkling them with am- 
monia water. 

Cautions. — Formaldehyde is in- 
tensely irritating to the eyes, nose and 
mouth. It kills the upper layers of 
the skin if applied in too strong solu- 
tions. The inhalation in ordinary 
quantities of such formaldehyde as is 
given off while sprinkling sheets in a 
room about to be disinfected, is un- 
comfortable, but not dangerous. The 
discomfort may be lessened by tying 
a moist towel over the mouth and 
nose while engaged in such work. In- 
jury to the hands can be avoiaed by 
greasing them well before they come 
into contact with the formaldehyde 
solution, or by wearing rubber gloves. 
Sulphur Fumigation. — Sulphur will 
be found a thoroughly reliable gase- 
ous disinfectant of considerable pene- 
trating power if it is intelligently 
emjiloved. To obtain satisfactory re- 
sults "the following essentials of suc- 
cessful disinfection, established by 



INFECTION AND DISINFECTION 



655 



repeated experiments, must be ob- 
served: (a) the infected room, or 
rooms, must be tlioroughly closed, 
every cracii and crevice sealed; (b) 
suflBcient sulphur must be used; (c) 
there must be ample moisture in the 
room; (d) the time of exposure must 
be sufficient. Ten hours is the mini- 
mum. 

If sulphur is preferred for disin- 
fection, use four pounds of powdered 
sulphur to every thousand cubic feet 
in the room. Seal and otherwise 
prepare the room in all respects as 
for disinfection with formaldehyde. 
Place a common wood or fiber tub on 
a table — not on the floor. In this 
])lace an iron pot or earthenware 
crock supported by two or more 
bricks placed edgewise. Pour in 
water to the level of the top of the 
bricks. The disinfecting apparatus 
will then be in working order. Now 
fill the room with steam. Fumiga- 
tion with sulphur is not efficient un- 
less the air is very moist. Pile the 
sulphur in the form of a low cone 
with a depression on top about as 
large as the bowl of a tablespoon. 
Fill this with alcohol, turpentine or 
coal oil, and set it on fire. Immedi- 
ately leave the room and close and 
seal the door. The sulphur in burn- 
ing throws off sulphurous acid gas 
which, in the presence of steam, kills 
all infection. Keep the room closed 
for ten hours at least and preferably 
for twenty-four hours after starting 
the fumes. Then open the windows 
from the outside for ventilation and 
tlioroughly air the room before using. 

Sulphur candles can be used in- 
stead of crude sulphur but take care 
to use sufficient candles. The average 
candle on the market contains one 
pound of sulphur. Four of these will 
be required in the disinfection of a 
small room 10x10x10. Do not use a 
smaller number, no matter what direc- 
tions may accompany the candle. The 
water- jacketed candle is to be pre- 
ferred. Partly fill the tin aroimd can- 
dles with water and place them in a 
pan on a table, not on the floor. Let 
one-half pint of water be vaporized 
with each candle. 

Cautions. — There is one serious ob- 
jection to the use of sulphur, which 



must be fully understood. The fumes 
have a destructive action on fabrics 
of wool, silk, cotton and linen as tap- 
estries and draperies and tend to in- 
jure brass, copper, steel and gilt work. 
Colored fabrics are frequently changed 
in appearance and the strength im- 
paired. Hence such articles should be 
separately disinfected, as hereafter de- 
scribed, and removed from the room 
before it is disinfected by sulphur. 

Sulphur fumigation has the advan- 
tage over formaldehyde that it kills 
insects and thus prevents their con- 
veying the disease. An ideal plan of 
fumigation is to use first one method 
and then the other. 

ADDITIONAL DISINFECTION 

After a room has been fumigated 
with formaldehyde or sulphur, thor- 
oughly wash the floor and woodwork 
and all out of the way places, window 
ledges, picture molding, etc., and 
thoroughly wet all dust and dirt in 
cracks with the half-strength Standard 
Solution No. 3, Bichloride of Mercury 
(1:1,000). Follow this up with hot 
soap suds, afterwards rinse with 
cloths wet in the disinfectant. Do 
not attempt to mix soap suds with 
the disinfectant solution. Scrape off 
and burn the wall paper. Whitewash 
the ceiling and walls before re-pa- 
pering and open tlie room to sunlight 
and air for several days. Apply a 
fresh coat of paint to the woodwork. 

Cotton Fabrics. — Disinfect all cot- 
ton and linen fabrics by immersing 
them in Solution No. 3(1: 1,000) ; No. 
4 (5 per cent) or No. 5 (10 per cent), 
for four hours, after which boil them 
for at least half an hour, then laim- 
der as usual. Immerse soiled clothing 
in a disinfectant solution before it is 
dried. Before transporting dry cloth- 
ing or other infected material from 
the sick room to any other part of 
the house, wrap the articles in a sheet 
•wet in No. 3 (1:1,000), or No. 4 (5 
per cent), or in the absence of these 
wet in water. 

Woolen Fabrics. — Disinfect woolen 
goods with formaldehyde fumigation 
in an empty trunk, wooden box or 
wash boiler, or in tight closets or other 
air-tight enclosed spaces. All un- 



556 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



washable clothing, bed clothing, mat- 
tresses and similar objects may be 
disinfected in this manner. Place one 
layer at a time in any air-tight en- 
closure having a close fitting door, lid 
or other cover. Sprinkle each suc- 
cessive layer with a 40 per cent solu- 
tion of formalin, full strength, by 
means of a sprayer or small sprinkling 
pot, at the rate of about two table- 
spoonfuls of the solution to each gar- 
ment. Protect silks or other delicate 
fabrics which might be spotted by di- 
rect contact with the drops of moist- 
ure by means of cotton sheets or tow- 
els placed between each layer. Spray 
the formalin on this protective cover- 
ing. Now close the receptacle, seal 
all cracks and crevices by means of 
wet strips of paper and leave it im- 
Opened in a warm room for at least 
twelve hours. Afterwards expose the 
articles for a day or more to direct 
sunshine. If the smell of formalde- 
hyde persists, sprinkle a little aqua 
ammonia on the articles to remove it. 

Or, disinfect by soaking in corro- 
sive sublimate or formaldehvde solu- 
tions No. 3 (1:1,000), and No. 5 (6| 
per cent), in a wooden or fiber wash 
tub. yVfterwards boil for half an hour 
and launder as usual. 

Money, jewelry, letters, valuable 
papers and similar articles may be 
disinfected by spraying with a 40 per 
cent solution of formalin, full strength, 
by means of a hand atomizer. Place 
them in a small wooden or pasteboard 
box with a tight-fitting cover, seal 
and keep in a warm room for twelve 
hours. Burn all books, magazines, 
newspapers and other articles the 
value of which is not great enough 
to warrant disinfection. 

Bedding. — Throw straw beds out of 
the window, empty out and burn the 
straw, and disinfect the tick as for 
cotton clothing. Disinfect feather 
beds, pillows, quilts, comforters and 
blankets in a steam disinfector when 
practical, or if not soiled, with for- 
maldehyde in large quantities. Tf 
mattresses have been soiled i)y the 
patient's discharges and steaming dis- 
infection is not practical, burn tiiem. 

Rugs and Carpets. — Tliese should 
be removed from the sick room be- 
fore the patient is installed, but if 



they remain and become infected, dis- 
infect with steam or by soaking in 
corrosive sublimate or formaldehyde 
solutions. If their value is slight burn 
them. 

Lounges. Couches and Other Up- 
holstered Furniture. — Leave in place 
when the room is fumigated. Strip 
off and disinfect the covering as for 
cotton and linen clothing. Burn the 
filling and replace with new. 

The hands of nurses and others 
who have attended to the wants of 
the sicli should be disinfected with 
thorough and prolonged washing and 
scrubbing with hot soap and water, 
and then immersed for several min- 
utes in a carbolic, bichloride or for- 
maldehyde solution. 

Sputum. — Receive on pieces of pa- 
per or rag or in paper sputum cups 
and burn. Or receive in cuspidors 
containing carbolic or formaldehyde 
solutions. 

Disinfection of the Dead. — Bodies 
of persons dying of smallpox, scar- 
let fever, diphtheria, membranous 
croup or measles, should be wrapped 
in several thicknesses of cloth wrung 
out of full strength corrosive subli- 
mate, carbolic or formaldehyde solu- 
tion and should not thereafter be ex- 
posed to view. The funeral should 
be private and no persons except the 
undertaker and his assistant, the 
clergyman and the imTnediate family 
of the deceased should attend. Car- 
riages used by persons attending the 
funeral ceremony should be fumi- 
gated. No person should enter the 
sick room imtil it has been thoroughly 
disinfected. 

Rules for the Sick Room. — Sun- 
light kills disease germs and should 
be admitted freely to the sick room 
unless the patient is suffering from 
some condition which renders dark- 
ness necessary. 

Proper ventilation diminishes the 
number of disease germs in the sick 
room by carrying some such germs 
into the open air. Ihe number of 
germs likely to pass from an ordi- 
narily well-kei)t sick room into the 
open air by means of ventilation is 
so small that tlicy cannot be regarded 
as dangerous to people on the out- 
side. Moreover, such organisms 



INFECTION AND DISINFECTION

speedily die because they are not 
adapted to live in the open air. The 
ventilation of a sick room should not, 
however, be such as to permit air to 
pass from the sick room into the rest 
of the house. 

Have all utensils and materials nec- 
essary for disinfection placed where 
they can be used with the least possi- 
ble trouble. Failure to disinfect is 



often due to the fact that proper 
facilities for disinfecting are not con- 
veniently at hand. 

See that every bottle and box con- 
taining a disinfectant is properly la- 
beled and see that all such bottles 
and boxes are kept apart from bot- 
tles and boxes containing medicines 
for internal use. Accidental poison- 
ing may be thus avoided.

TYPHOID FEVER — THE SICK ROOM — TUBERCULOSIS OR CON- 
SUMPTION — SMALLPOX — VACCINATION — CHICKENPOX — 
MALARIA — YELLOW FEVER — HOOKWORM DISEASE — FOR- 
EIGN DISEASES — CONTAGIOUS DISEASES OF ANIMALS 



Since the rise of the germ theory 
there has been a complete revolution 
in the attitude of well-informed per- 
sons toward the subject of disease. A 
large number of the most common 
and heretofore fatal enemies of man- 
kind are now well known to be abso- 
lutely preventable. 

The appearance of the first case of 
any communicable malady may be 
due to unavoidable accident; the 
spread of the disease must be attrib- 
uted to ignorance or to criminal care- 
lessness. In cities, persons ill with 
contagious diseases are either isolated 
in hospitals set apart for that pur- 
pose, or quarantined in their own 
homes by law. The necessary sani- 
tary regulations are enforced by 
trained ins]iectors under the authority 
of the Board of Health. The ab- 
sence of such officials in most rural 
neighborhoods shifts this responsibil- 
ity to the head of the family. Unless 
pai'ents in such localities take the 
pains to inform themselves so that 
they can intelligently cooperate with 
the attending physician, unnecessary 
death from preventable diseases will 
continue to occur. 

No attempt will be made here to 
discuss the treatment of contagious 
or other diseases. In all suspected 
cases a physician should be promptly 
summoned. Our purpose here is sim- 
])ly to make clear the causes of pre- 
ventable disease and to describe the 
ordinary sources and channels of in- 
fection. When these are fullv under- 



stood and proper preventive measures 
taken, the likelihood of infection will 
be reduced to a minimum. Or, if by 
some unhappy accident a member of 
a family becomes infected, such 
knowledge will enable those in charge 
of the patient to prevent the spread 
of the disease. A careful study has 
been made of all the recent publica- 
tions of Boards of Health of city, 
state and nation throughout the 
L^nited States. The most essential 
knowledge which they impart is here 
condensed for ready reference. Many 
of these bulletins, however, contain 
detailed information on each of the 
principal contagious diseases which 
would extend far bej'ond the limits of 
the present chapter. Hence, on the 
appearance of any contagious disease, 
in any family or neighborhood, ad- 
dress a postal card to the Secretary 
of the Board of Health at the near- 
est metropolitan city. Address an- 
other to the Secretary of the State 
Board of Health at the State Capital. 
Also a third to the Surgeon-General 
of the U^nited States, Washington, 
D. C. Name the disease and request 
copies of all available circular mat- 
ter relating to it. Three cents thus 
spent on postal cards will bring back, 
without charge, full detailed practical 
information and instruction of great 
value. Also ask to have copies of 
these bulletins mailed to the heads of 
other families where contagious dis- 
eases have broken out, or where, 
through ignorance or neglect, condi- 



558 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 659 



tions are so unsanitary as to threaten 
the public health. 

No ordinary person would know- 
ingly give poison to the members of 
his own family or those of his neigh- 
bor. Yet, through ignorance, many 
well meaning persons are permitting 
the existence of conditions within 
their control which result directlj' in 
the poisoning of others through the 
germs of contagious diseases. 

Contagious Diseases. — The most 
usual communicable diseases among 
adults are consumption (tubercu- 
losis), typhoid fever (typhus fever), 
smallpox, and, in some localities, yel- 
low fever, malaria and hookworm 
disease. 

Several other communicable dis- 
eases are most common among chil- 
dren, as diphtheria (membranous 
croup, diphtheritic sore throat), scar- 
let fever (scarlatina, scarlet rash), 
measles (German measles), chicken- 
pox, mumps, and whooping cough. 
Another class is most prevalent 
among small infants, as infantile pa- 
ralysis (anterior poliomyelitis), cere- 
brospinal meningitis, summer com- 
plaint, congenital blindness (ophthal- 
mia neonatorum). The preventable 
diseases of children are discussed in 
the succeeding chapter. 

There is a small class of virulent 
contagious diseases the infection 
from which may usually be traced to 
immigration from foreign parts. 
These include Asiatic cholera, bubonic 
plague and leprosy. Another com- 
municable disease to which especial 
attention has been directed in recent 
years is hookworm disease. In addi- 
tion, pediculosis, trachoma, ringworm, 
scabies and impetigo contagiosa, are 
held to be so contagious as to be dan- 
gerous to the public health. 

Most of the above diseases are 
known to be jireventable. It is con- 
fidently believed that all can be con- 
trolled and their communication from 
one person to another prevented, if 
certain well understood precautions 
are observed. 

TYPHOID FEVER 

Typhoid Fever (Enteric Fever, 
Abdominal Typhus) is an infectious 



disease caused by a specific germ 
known as the typhoid bacillus. This 
is a low form of vegetable life be- 
longing to the group of bacteria. It 
was discovered by Eberth in 1880, 
Each germ is a minute vegetable cell 
shaped like a cylinder with round 
ends. Each is equipped with a num- 
ber of long, leg-like processes called 
flagelte which give it the power of 
swimming rapidly in liquids. These 
bacteria can be seen only by the aid 
of the most powerful microscope. 
They are so small that half a million 
would scarcely cover the head of a 
pin. Yet, each is descended from 
another germ of the same kind, has 
its own individual life and can be 
produced in no other way. These 
germs, under favorable conditions, 
multiply very rapidly. Each splits 
into two, each two into four, each 
four into eight and so on. A single 
colony of a few score germs may, 
within forty-eight hours, develop into 
a billion. 

We do not " catch " typhoid, we 
swallow it. The germs invariably 
enter the system through the mouth. 
Thence they pass into the stomach. 
Here thej'' may be destroyed by the 
acids present in the gastric juice, a 
fact which may explain why some 
persons who are known to have swal- 
lowed the germs do not develop ty- 
phoid fever. But if not destroyed in 
the stomach they pass on into the 
intestine. The conditions present in 
the lower third of the small intes- 
tine seem especial^ to favor their 
growth. Here they multiplj'^ rapidlji^ 
and become very active. It takes 
anywhere from seven days to three 
weeks to bring on the symptoms of 
the disease after the germs are swal- 
lowed. This is called the incubation 
period. The average is from ten to 
twelve days. The germ attacks pri- 
marily the glands of the intestines, 
causing small absesses by which the 
intestinal walls are often perforated 
through and through. It also at- 
tacks other organs during the course 
of the disease and may attack any 
part of the body. 

Typhoid fever exists at all seasons 
of the year, but is most prevalent in 
autumn. The greatest number of 



560 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



deaths occur in September and Octo- 
ber. 

Symptoms. — Typhoid fever is a 
very insidious disease since there may 
be no symptoms whatever during the 
period of incubation, that is, on an 
average, for ten to twelve days after 
infection has taken place. It is often 
diflScult to determine the day on 
which the disease begins to make it- 
self manifest. Cases are usually 
dated from the day on which the 
patient gives uj) work and takes to 
his bed. The disease may then have 
been in existence for a considerable 
time. In cases known as " walking " 
typhoid, the patient is never pros- 
trated. The patient and his family 
may be unaware of the nature of the 
disease. Yet germs are being given 
oflf which may infect others with ty- 
phoid in its most malignant form. 
For these reasons it is advisable to 
summon a physician promptly in all 
suspected cases and to treat every 
case of fever as typhoid until the 
physician has completed his diag- 
nosis. 

Every case of so-called " typho- 
malarial fever " and every case of 
doubtful origin continuing more than 
seven days, should be reported to the 
local health oflBcer, and due precau- 
tions taken. 

Painless diarrhoea, or simple " loose- 
ness of the bowels," occurring in 
one who has never had typhoid 
fever should excite suspicion if the 
disease is known to exist in the 
neighborhood. The mild, " walking " 
cases are by no means uncommon. 
Hence it is advisable that all diar- 
rhoeal discharges should be disinfected 
especially during the existence of ty- 
phoid fever in a community. 

As a rule the disease comes on 
slowly. The first symptoms are head- 
ache, with a general sense of fatigue 
and loss of appetite. The headache 
may be severe and confined to the top 
of the head, or may consist of more 
or less general soreness. AMominal 
pain occurs in about one-third of 
all cases. A low fever is almost 
always present from the outset. But 
this may be so slight that the patient 
is unaware of it. Women or chil- 
dren in tlie first stages of the disease 



often keep up about the house, or 
they may be compelled to lie down a 
part of the day. Men frequently 
give up work for a day or two and 
after a little rest go to work again. 
When such sym^Jtoms are observed 
as tiring easily, digestive disturb- 
ances, headache, drowsiness, and ab- 
dominal pain that cannot be attrib- 
uted to any special condition, a physi- 
cian should be promptly consulted. 

If the onset of the disease is more 
sudden, there may be nausea and 
vomiting, accompanied by a chill and 
high fever. A slight cough and oc- 
casional nosebleed may be present. 
Whenever there is doubt as to tlie 
diagnosis, the attending physician 
should have a blood test made. The 
Widal test is made free for health 
officers and physicians in the public 
laboratories of most states. 

Prognosis. — During the first week 
of the disease, the symptoms gradu- 
ally grow worse, fever develops and 
the patient suffers chilly sensations. 
The temperature gradually rises to a 
height of 10;3 to 105 degrees F. In 
severe forms of the disease, diar- 
rhcea commences during the first 
week and is then continuous. 

During the second week the above 
symptoms become more severe. Ner- 
vousness and delirium develop. Mi- 
nute reddish spots resembling flea 
bites are frequently observed over 
the chest, abdomen and thighs. 
These spots disappear after a few 
days. Then a fresh crop appears in 
other situations. Tlie bronchial tubes 
frequently become inflamed. Some- 
times ])neumonia develops. Bleeding 
from the bowels is an occasional 
symptom in the second week of this 
disease and is highly characteris- 
tic. 

During the third week, in normal 
cases, the symptoms gradually abate. 
The fever lessens. The diarrhoea im- 
proves. The nervous symptoms and 
the delirium diminish. The patient, 
though much emaciated, gradually 
returns to a normal condition. Or 
the sj'mptoms may increase in se- 
verity, the patient become profound- 
ly prostrated, the delirium deepen 
and death occur. The hemorrhage 
from the bowels in some instances 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 661 



may be so severe that death is pro- 
duced even in comparatively early 
stages of the infection. This is 
quite as frequent in the mild cases 
known as walking typhoid as in oth- 
ers; hence the patient should receive 
equally careful attention. 

The mortality varies from five to 
twenty per cent, depending upon the 
character of the disease and the na- 
ture of the nursing and treatment. 
A physician should be summoned 
and his directions implicitly followed. 
Nothing in this disease is of more 
importance than careful nursing. It 
is absolutely necessary that the pa- 
tient receive only liquid diet until the 
physician permits other food. Solid 
food given prematurely will cause 
death. 

Modes of Infection. — There is a 
common opinion among the laity that 
typhoid fever is contracted from foul 
drains and other things which con- 
taminate the atmosphere; this is 
probably never the case, although 
such conditions may be injurious to 
health. 

The germs, or typhoid bacilli, can 
enter the body in no other way thaA 
through the mouth. Direct infection 
is thought to occur most often 
through contaminated milk or drink- 
ing water, but secondary infection — 
that is, where one member of a fam- 
ily " catches " the disease from an- 
other — is believed to occur chiefly by 
transmitting the germs to the mouth 
with the fingers. This may come 
about by handling the patient or 
something which has come in contact 
with him, or by means of food or oth- 
er articles which have been handled 
by the nurse or others with unwashed 
hands after coming into contact with 
the patient. A little reflection will 
show how easily the virus may get 
upon cooking utensils, drinking cups, 
bed linen, door knobs and similar ar- 
ticles, or may be carried from place 
to place by pets or insects, particu- 
larly flies. 

The germs leave the patient's body 
in the discharges of the bowels and 
bladder, in some cases in the sputum 
and possibly in perspiration. Espe- 
cially must it be borne in mind that 
the urine of a typhoid fever patient 



is even more dangerous than the 
stools. 

The germs may be found in very 
large numbers in these discharges, 
upon the bed linen, in the water with 
which the patient is bathed and upon 
the utensils used in nursing and feed- 
ing him. They are probably never 
carried on dust through the air. If 
every typhoid germ was destroyed as 
soon as it left the human body the 
disease would be speedily eradicated. 
But this, unfortunately, is by no 
means the case. 

Infection from Water Supply. — 
Investigation has shown that most 
epidemics of the disease are caused 
by the excreta of the patient having 
been thrown upon the ground or into 
an open vault or drain, whence by 
seepage or surface drainage they were 
carried into a spring, well, or other 
source of water supply. A well- 
known instance is an epidemic in an 
eastern city of about eight thousand 
population. Within a few weeks 
there were more than one thousand 
cases and over one hundred deaths. 
The water supply of this community 
is obtained from a mountain brook. 
It was contaminated by the discharges 
from a single typhoid fever patient 
thrown upon the snow, in winter, 
near the headwaters of the stream. 
The consequent expense to this small 
community in loss of wages and care 
of the sick was estimated as in excess 
of $100,000. The annual losses 
throughout the United States from 
this disease, which must be regarded 
as almost entirely preventable, are 
estimated at many hundred thousand 
dollars. Investigation shows that 
milk is usually contaminated indi- 
rectly through an infected water sup- 
ply. Hence due precautions to se- 
cure the purity of the water supply 
is of prime importance in the pre- 
vention of this disease. 

Well water is frequently a cause of 
the disease. Too often we find a 
privy, or rather a hole in the ground 
containing fecal and urinary dis- 
charges, in close ]iroximity to a well, 
and often upon higher ground. And 
unless the soil possesses the Ix'st of 
filtering properties, and this is fre- 
quently not the case, the well will 



562 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



certainly become contaminated. In- 
fected discharges thrown on the 
ground may be washed into the well 
by the first rain storm. 

Water which has a bad taste or 
odor, or wliich comes from a source 
that renders it likely to be impure, 
is dangerous, but unfortunately the 
reverse is not true. Dangerously 
contaminated water may be, and 
often is clear and colorless and may 
have no bad taste or odor. 

Infected Milk Supply. — Milk is a 
very common and dangerous source 
of infection, because it is what med- 
ical men call an excellent " culture 
medium," that is, germs grow and 
multiply very rapidly in fresh milk. 
Nor do they cause the milk to be- 
come sour or in any other way give 
evidence of their presence. Milk is 
never infected when it comes from 
the cow. It is always infected by 
man. This usually takes place 
through washing the milk cans or 
other utensils with polluted water. 
Watered milk may contain the germs 
of typhoid, for a milkman who adul- 
terates milk with water is not usually 
careful of the quality of his source 
of supply. The milkers or others 
who handle the milk may infect it, 
if t;i'7>hoid germs are present on their 
hands or clothing. Or, infected flies 
may fall into the milk. The germs 
from infected milk may also be 
foimd in butter and cheese. Hence 
no milk or other dairy products 
should be sold from a dairy, farm, 
or house where there is a case of ty- 
phoid fever. 

Infection from Ice. — The germs 
of typhoid fever are not destroyed 
by freezing. Hence ice taken from 
sewage-polluted rivers or lakes, or ice 
manufactured from such waters, is 
unsafe to use. 

Infection from Vegetables. — Veg- 
etables often become infected with 
the germs of typhoid by irrigation 
with polluted water, by contamina- 
tion from night-soil used by farmers 
or market gardeners as a fertilizer, 
by flies and other insects. Creel, in 
a careful review of the results of 
recent scientific investigation, asserts 
that the typhoid bacillus may retain 
its vitality in privy vaults or in 



night-soil used as a fertilizer for a 
period of several weeks, or even 
months, and that plants cultivated in 
contaminated soil may take up the 
germs on their leaves and stems in 
the process of growth. He found 
living typhoid bacilli on the tips of 
leaves that to the naked eye appeared 
free from any particles of soil. He 
also proved by careful observation 
that rainfall will not free vegetables 
wholly from infected material. This 
source of pollution is especially dan- 
gerous in the case of such vege- 
tables as lettuce, radishes and celery, 
which are eJiten raw. The remedy is 
to thoroughly wash or scrub them 
free from earth and bacteria by 
means of a stiif brush. All vege- 
tables should be cleaned in this man- 
ner, but the danger of infection is 
less from cooked vegetables, as most 
germs of disease are destroyed by 
boiling. 

All fruits, such as grapes, apples, 
pears, berries and the like, including 
lemons and oranges, should be care- 
fully washed in at least three waters 
or for five minutes in rxmning water, 
especially in times of epidemic dis- 
ease. Dried figs and dates are very 
commonly eaten without being cooked 
or washed, yet they have been ex- 
posed for an unknown space of 
time to all kinds of contagion from 
dust, flies and dirty hands. Shelled 
nuts purchased in the market should 
be washed and scalded before they 
are used, as they are commonly ex- 
posed to similar infection. 

The Typhoid Fly. — This term has 
been ap))lied to the common house 
fly by L. O. Howard to draw atten- 
tion to the danger of infection from 
this insect. Flies cannot become the 
carriers of disease germs imless they 
have access to some source of infec- 
tion. Hence the danger is much les- 
sened by the elimination of all nui- 
sances in the neighborhood of our 
dwellings. However, since flies may 
travel from considerable distances, 
the only assurance of safety against 
infection from them is to exclude 
them by screening or destroy them by 
means of traps and poisons. 

Flies having access to privy vaults 
or sources of typhoid infection else- 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 563 



where, and then, through unscreened 
doors and windows, to living rooms, 
alighting upon food already prepared 
for the table or to be used without 
subsequent heating, are a serious dan- 
ger. Some of these articles, liquid, 
semi-solid, or with moist surfaces, 
thus slightly infected, serve as con- 
genial culture media for the rapid 
multiplication of the infection. A 
few typhoid germs brought on the 
hairy feet of flies may increase many 
fold if deposited in milk or on the 
surface of boiled potato. 

While typhoid is not ordinarily an 
air-borne disease, care should be 
taken to avoid the typhoid patient's 
breath and not to come unneces- 
sarily in his immediate vicinity espe- 
cially if he has pneumonia, or an 
explosive cough. The sputum bear- 
ing infection may be sprayed into 
the air during coughing, but the 
range of possible danger is slight — 
hardly more than four or five feet. 

The disease is also occasionally 
spread by the dust of dried urine or 
other excreta, which is carried 
through the air, thereby contaminat- 
ing food or water. Some authorities 
still hold that the disease may be 
communicated by inhaling these par- 
ticles by mouth or nostrils. The 
diarrhoeal discharge, when dry, may 
preserve the poison as effectually as 
the crusts of smallpox, the scales 
of scarlet fever, and the dried mem- 
brane of diphtheria preserve the 
specific poisons of those diseases. 

Among miscellaneous sources of 
infection may be mentioned bread, 
pastry, confectionery, fruits, vege- 
tables, meats, etc., handled by in- 
fected hands in bakeries, stores, mar- 
kets and slaughterhouses, or the same 
articles and milk infected by flies 
recently arrived from sources of 
filth. 

The general filth conditions in the 
homes of extremely untidy families 
favor the spread of typhoid infec- 
tion, and in such homes or in any 
homes where there is neglect of the 
greatest possible cleanliness of the 
sick person, his bedding, clothing and 
everything else in the management of 
him, the danger from secondary in- 
fection is serious. 



THE SICK ROOM 

Care of a Typhoid Patient. — As 
typhoid fever is one of the most 
common of communicable diseases, 
full instructions will be given here 
for the management of the sick room 
in such a way as to preclude the 
possibility of other members of the 
family becoming infected. All of 
these instructions apply equally to 
other contagious diseases with the 
addition of especial precautions in 
certain other ailments which will be 
mentioned. 

Isolation. — The first and most es- 
sential precaution in the case of ty- 
phoid or other communicable disease 
is that the patient should be com- 
pletely isolated. Unless this is done, 
other members of the family are al- 
most sure to contract the malady. 
The safest course is to send the pa- 
tient to a hospital. When this is not 
possible, select a large airy room as 
the sick room. This should be lo- 
cated on the sunny side of the house, 
and should have a fire ]ilace if the 
weather be cold. It should be as far 
from living and slecjjing rooms of 
other persons as possible. It is of 
the utmost consequence that the 
room have windows and doors by 
means of which it can be at all times 
thoroughly ventilated. At all sea- 
sons of the year a room on the low- 
est floor of the house is more satis- 
factory, since it is warmer in the 
winter and cooler in the summer. 
The room should not be uncomfort- 
bly cold, though it is much better 
to have the temperature too low than 
to have it stuffy. In most diseases 
ventilation is of supreme importance, 
and should be secured at any cost. 
There are no better disinfectants 
than pure air and sunlight. A tem- 
perature of about 70° F., if com- 
patible with thorough ventilation, is 
generally considered most desirable. 
The sick room should have its win- 
dows always open day and night, and 
there should be an open fire if pos- 
sible, otherwise recovery will be 
greatly delayed, for bad air of itself 
makes well persons sick. Keep the 
patient out of draughts. 

Preparing the Sick Room. — Be- 



564 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



fore installing the patient, take up 
the carpet and remove all rugs, orna- 
ments, curtains, portieres, bureau 
scarfs and hangings of every descrip- 
tion. Empty bureau drawers, remove 
the contents of closets and clothes- 
presses, in short, take everything out 
of the room that is not necessary, 
and especially all sorts of fabrics 
which may serve as catch-alls for the 
germs of the disease. The room 
should contain no more furniture 
than is necessary. Metal bedsteads, 
plain wooden chairs and tables, are 
best. Remove all scarfs from tables 
and cushions, doilies and the like 
from chairs. Seal up door cracks 
and keyholes communicating with 
other rooms by pasting over them 
strips of wrapping paper. Suspend 
over the doorway a sheet reaching 
from the top to the floor, moistened 
with full strength carbolic or bi- 
chloride solutions No. 3 and No. 4. 
Tack this across the top and one side, 
leaving the other side free to be 
pushed aside to gain entrance. Only 
such toys, books and the like should 
be given the patient as can be de- 
stroyed after recovery or death. 

The floor, woodwork and furniture 
should be frequently wiped with 
cloths moistened with half strength 
Standard Disinfectant Solution No. 
3, 4 or 5. Throw away the broom 
and duster. Use only damp cloths 
moistened with half strength Solu- 
tion No. 3, 4 or 5, for cleaning floor 
and furniture. These should be at 
once thrown into the disinfectant so- 
lution or burned. It is well to wash 
the floor each day with one of the 
same solutions. 

Cleanliness. — Keep the premises 
clean. All decaying animal and veg- 
etable matter and every kind of filth 
in and around the house should be 
removed, and disinfectants freely 
used. Surface drains and gutters, 
areas, outhouses, privies, shelters for 
domestic animals, fowls, etc., should 
receive close and constant attention. 
Use Standard Disinfectant No. 1 or 
No. 2, freely and regularly, in every 
such place. 

Odors. — Never allow bad smells to 
exist. If free ventilation, sun.shlne 
and cleanliness do not keep out bad 



smells, sprinkle diluted formalde- 
hyde, one part formaldehyde to 50 
parts of water, upon the floor, or 
spray it into the air with an atom- 
izer. 

Bed and Bedding. — Place the pa- 
tient's bed in the middle of the room, 
or at least away from the wall. Do 
not suflFer the bed covers to come in 
contact with the walls or floor so as 
to contaminate them. The bed should 
be narrow. A mattress is much to 
be preferred to a feather bed. The 
cover should consist of a sheet long 
enough to fold back at the head over 
the other coverings for some dis- 
tance. Blankets should be used for 
warmth in preference to quilts. 
Keep the bed scrupulously clean, and 
remove the linen and coverings 
promptly when soiled. The nurse 
should see to it that bread crumbs do 
not remain in the bed. 

The best way to make up the bed 
for the typhoid patient is the follow- 
ing: (1) Over the mattress (no 
feather bed) spread smoothly and 
tuck in the sheet. Under the sheet 
have preferably a once-folded sheet 
or blanket. (2) Next spread a rub- 
ber sheet crosswise the bed, the two 
ends tucked smoothly under the 
edges of the mattress. (3) A folded 
sheet (draw-sheet) also crosswise 
over the rubber sheet. (4) A second 
rubber sheet. (5) Over that a sec- 
ond draw-sheet. 

To Remove Soiled Bed Clothes. — 
Move the patient to one side of the 
bed as near the edge as possible, and 
loosen the sheet beneath him at the 
head and foot and on the opposite 
side. Then roll it up toward the pa- 
tient and push it well u]) imder him, 
leaving the side of the bed o]>posite 
to that upon which he is lying bare. 
Upon this place the new sheet. Tuck 
this under the edges of the mattress, 
and pull the patient back over on it. 
Now remove the soiled sheet and pull 
the edges of the fresh one over the 
portions of the bed still uncovered, 
and secure in the usual way. 

Cleanliness greatly aids recovery, 
hence the utmost cleanliness of the 
patient and his surroundings should 
be the rule. If there is diarrhoea, 
the mattress should be protected by 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 565 



an impervious rubber sheet placed 
under the linen sheet, or by newspa- 
per pads. Oilcloth cracks and wrin- 
kles too badly to be suitable. Pro- 
vide two or more rubber sheets so 
that they can be changed and cleaned 
as often as required. Sponge the 
rubber sheets with standard carbolic 
acid solution No. 4 (5 per cent) and 
dry and air them in the sun for sev- 
eral hours daily. If the condition of 
the patient makes it difficult to avoid 
the soiling of his bed, provide smaller 
squares of rubber sheeting and fold- 
ed sheets to be placed above the ordi- 
nary sheets. Remove all soiled sheets 
and clothing promptly before dry- 
ing occurs. (See Disinfection.) Take 
care to cleanse and disinfect the pa- 
tient locally with a solution of corro- 
sive sublimate 1 : 2,000 — half a dram 
to the gallon of water, or one tablet 
to the quart. 

Bathing. — All patients, if the at- 
tending physician approves, should 
have a daily bath, sjjecial attention 
being given to the hair, teeth, mouth 
and nails. Tn many cases it is neces- 
sary to wash the patient's mouth fre- 
quently with some antiseptic wash. 
But this should only be done on the 
express instructions of the doctor. 

Disinfection. — A pail or tub should 
be kept in the room, containing a 
standard disinfectant solution such 
as No. 3, 4 or 5 for the purpose of 
disinfecting every article of clothing 
before it is carried through the house. 
One of these solutions should be kept 
standing in the tub and renewed at 
frequent intervals. All blankets, 
sheets, towels, napkins, bandages and 
clothing, used either by the patient 
or the attendant shotild be at once 
immersed in this tub and remain at 
least three hours. After this they 
should be boiled for at least one- 
half hour. The body linen of the 
patient should be changed daily or 
oftener if soiled. When removed 
it should be immersed immediately in 
this tub. Rags, closet paper or other 
material used about the person of 
the patient should be immediately 
burned. 

The discharges from the throat, 
mouth and nose are especially dan- 
gerous and must be cared for at 



once. It is well to prepare a num- 
ber of squares of old soft cloth — 
old sheets or pillow cases are good — 
to receive these discharges. These 
cloths should be burned as soon as 
soiled. If there is no fire in the sick 
room, it is convenient to have a small 
tub containing any strong standard 
disinfecting solution, to receive these 
cloths until they can be carried from 
the room and burned. 

The nurse or attendant should 
wear washable clothing and over all 
a washable go\vn, preferably with a 
hood attachment for the protection 
of the hair. The gown and hood 
should be removed and the exjjosed 
surface disinfected when leaving the 
sick room, even though temporarily. 
A good rule is to consider that every- 
thing which has been brought into 
the sick rom has become infected 
and should be carefully disinfected 
before it is carried out. 

The hands of the attendant should 
be immediately washed and disinfect- 
ed after any contact with the patient 
or his clothing. A good sui)i>ly of 
towels and tin or porcelain basins 
for this purpose should be kept on 
hand. Probably the best disinfectant 
for this purpose is standard solu- 
tion of corrosive sublimate No. 3, 
consisting of one gram to one quart 
of water. No one should ever leave 
the sick room without first thoroughly 
washing the hands in a disinfectant 
solution, or with carbolic or other 
antiseptic soap, with especial care to 
clean and scrub the finger nails. It 
is best to then soak the hands for 
two or three minutes in half strength 
disinfectant solution No. 3 or 4, and 
then wash them off in fresh water. 

A large bottle of such a solution 
should be kept in the sick room for 
this purpose. Otherwise the nurse 
may handle something outside the 
room leaving the germs thereon to 
be picked up by some one else. It is 
probable that 90 per cent of all cases 
of secondary infection are brought 
about in this manner. The nurse 
should carefully avoid soiling door 
knobs or anything else which may be 
touched by others. While typhoid 
fever is both contagious and infec- 
tious there is no danger of contract- 



566 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



ing the disease if we prevent the 
germs from getting into our mouths. 
This can be easily done. The only 
occasion for a second case occurring 
in a household must come either 
from ignorance or carelessness. With 
proper disinfection of the hands and 
general cleanliness the nurse or at- 
tendant may take her meals at the 
household table. At all events she 
should not eat in the sick room. 

Food and Drink. — The tray, 
dishes, and other utensils used in the 
sick room should be set apart for 
the exclusive use of the patient. 
Never wash them in the same pan as 
other dishes for the family. Use a 
separate dish cloth and wiping towel. 
First immerse these articles for an 
hour in a half strength standard dis- 
infectant solution No. 3, 4 or 5 and 
then boil for half an hour and keep 
apart from all other household uten- 
sils. It is best to use paper napkins, 
which should be burned. If cloth 
napkins are used they should be im- 
mersed in the same disinfectant so- 
lution as the bed and body linen. 
All solid food brought into the sick 
room and not consumed by the pa- 
tient should be placed in paper bags 
to be removed by the attendant and 
burned. Liquid foods should be 
poured into a disinfectant. Neither 
the nurse nor any other person should 
be permitted to eat any portion of 
the food remaining. Nothing should 
be eaten by a well person while in 
the sick room nor should anything 
which has been in the room be eaten. 
Nurses and attendants should al- 
ways wash their hands in a disinfect- 
ant solution before eating or put- 
ting anything into their mouths. It 
is absolutely necessary that this rule 
be scrupulously observed. 

If milk is delivered to the house 
in bottles, never let these be taken 
into the room of the typhoid case. 
If you do, these bottles may be the 
means of carrying the disease to some 
one else. Keep special bottles of 
your own for the patient's milk. 
Empty the milk into one of these as 
soon as received. Then scald out the 
dairy bottle and keep it as far as 
possible from the sick room until it is 
given back to the driver. 



Quarantine. — All unnecessary vis- 
itors should be excluded from the 
sick room. If a nurse can be pro- 
vided, all members of the family 
should be kept away. Otherwise, one 
or two persons should be detailed as 
attendants and all others should be 
excluded. Certainly tliere is no need 
that all the relatives, neighbors and 
friends should visit the patient. ITiis 
can do no good but in the majority of 
instances will do harm, and they take 
a chance of getting the disease. The 
quieter the patient is kept, both dur- 
ing illness and convalescence, the 
better for him. Children, especially, 
should be carefully excluded. They 
have little or no sense of cleanliness 
and are constantly putting their fin- 
gers and other things into their 
mouths. It has been shown that 
children contract communicable dis- 
eases much more readily than grown 
persons. If visitors are permitted to 
see the patient they should touch 
nothing in the room, or if they do, 
should wash their hands in a disin- 
fectant solution upon leaving. All 
visitors, including members of the 
family, should be cautioned not to 
shake hands with or kiss the patient. 
No one should sit for any length of 
time in the sick room unless com- 
pelled to do so. 

Removal of Excretions. — The dis- 
charges from the bowels and kidneys 
should be received into a bedpan or 
vessel containing at least a quart of 
full-strength disinfectants No. 1 or 
No. 2. Enough of the same should 
be added to cover them and be thor- 
oughly mixed by stirring. Solid 
masses should be broken U]) with a 
stick which can be burned, or a glass 
rod which can be disinfected. See 
that all lumps are thoroughly 
broken up. Disinfectants cannot kill 
germs unless they come in contact 
with them. They should stand in the 
vessel for not less than an hour. 
"Where there are sewers they may 
then be emptied into the water closet, 
taking care not to soil the seats or 
covers. In the country it is best to 
deposit the contents of the vessels 
in a trench. This must be remote, 
and, if possible, down hill from tlie 
well or nearest watercourse. The 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 567 



trench should be about four feet 
deep and two wide. Each deposit 
should at once be well covered with 
quicklime and earth well beaten 
down. When half filled in this man- 
ner the trench should be covered in 
with earth. But care must be taken 
that none of the excretions from per- 
sons afflicted with typhoid are ever 
emptied until thoroughly disinfected. 
Under no circumstances should these 
be poured out in the neighborhood of 
sjirings or wells. It should also be 
remembered that the water in which 
typhoid fever patients are bathed 
necessarily becomes infected. This 
should also be thoroughly disinfected 
before being emptied out. Vomited 
matter and the sputum from the pa- 
tient also contains the germs of ty- 
phoid and should receive the same 
care and thorough disinfection. 
These precautions should be con- 
tinued for some time after the patient 
has recovered. About three per cent, 
of all cases are carriers of the dis- 
ease for many months or even years. 
It is well to request the attending 
physician to ascertain by means of 
blood tests whether or not the germs 
of typhoid have left the system. 

A great responsibility rests upon 
the household in the management of 
a case of typhoid fever. To pour 
out the discharges from a patient in 
the back yard or expose them in 
open vaults or drains may be, and 
often is, equivalent to the murder of 
innocent neighbors by poisoning. Yet 
this is being done, in many thousands 
of instances, as tlie result of igno- 
rance of the fatal nature of the in- 
visible germs of the disease. 

Vermin. — Steps should be taken, if 
necessary, to destroy all such vermin 
as fleas, bedbugs, lice and especially 
rats and mice, by means described 
elsewhere in this volume. The sick 
room should be carefully screened 
against flies and mosquitoes. In- 
sects worry sick people and hinder 
recovery. Above everything else flies 
should not be permitted to enter the 
room, or, if they get in, should be 
killed before they get out. Screens 
are cheaper than additional cases of 
typhoid in the family. If flies are 
numerous in the vicinity a number 



of vessels containing fly poison 
should be exposed in the room. If 
sticky fly paper is used, it must be 
burned at frequent intervals, f'ly 
traps may be used if care is taken 
to destroy the insects with boiling 
water and to burn their bodies or de- 
posit them in a disinfectant. Or 
single flies may be killed by means of 
the ordinary fly swatter and then 
dropped into a disinfectant solution. 

After recovery and during con- 
valescence the patient is to be con- 
sidered dangerous so long as the in- 
testinal discharges continue to be 
more copious, liquid and frequent 
than natural; and these should be 
disinfected until the attending physi- 
cian advises that it is no longer 
necessary. 

In the event of death the body 
must be wrapjjed in a sheet thor- 
oughly soaked in full-strengtli Stand- 
ard Disinfectant No. 3 or 4, and 
placed in an air-tight corffin. This 
must remain in the sick room until 
removed for burial. Public fimerals 
and wakes over such bodies are for- 
bidden. 

Quarantine. — It is entirely un- 
necessarj^ to quarantine a case of 
typhoid fever, or the premises in 
which it exists, provided proper care 
is given to all the details of the sick 
room, as recommended. The use of 
placards has been largely discontin- 
ued in this disease. If the disinfec- 
tion is practiced as strictly as it 
should be, there is no danger of the 
disease being communicated to others 
from a given case; but constant 
cleanliness and disinfection are ab- 
solutely necessary to secure such re- 
sult. 

Anti-Typhoid Vaccination. — Ty- 
phoid fever in normal cases is a self- 
limiting disease. That is, unless the 
patient dies, the body develops within 
itself the power of resisting the virus. 
The patient then recovers and re- 
gains his health even though the 
germs are still developed in large 
numbers in the intestines. In recent 
years many attempts have been made 
by scientific men to perfect a serum 
for anti-typhoid vaccination and a 
number of different typhoid vac- 
cines are now upon the market. The 



568 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



use of typhoid vaccine was first pub- 
licly advocated in 1896 by Pfeiffer 
and Kolle in Germany and by A, 
Wright in England. In 1904 elabo- 
rate experiments were made and since 
that time the results obtained have 
been very encouraging. The degree 
of immunization obtained has not yet 
been equal to that secured by vac- 
cination against smallpox, but sta- 
tistics indicate that the likelihood of 
infection is greatly reduced by this 
means and that the death rate may 
be reduced at least one-half. It has 
been shown that, if proper precau- 
tions are observed, anti-typhoid vac- 
cination of healthy persons is harm- 
less and that the personal discom- 
fort caused by its application is or- 
dinarily very slight. The duration of 
immunity is not yet determined, but 
it is thought to be at least two and a 
half years and probably longer. It 
is the most effective method of pro- 
tection yet devised against the chron- 
ic bacillus carrier. Every member 
of the American army from the Sec- 
retary of War down is now required 
to be vaccinated against tj'phoid. 
And this is believed to be the prin- 
cipal cause of the immunity of 
the troops in recent army maneu- 
vers. 

Anti-tj'phoid vaccination should al- 
ways be done by a competent physi- 
cian. The infection often gives rise 
to slight fever and some j^ainful local 
and general symptoms. These dis- 
appear in from 24: to 48 hours. It 
may also result in temporarily weak- 
ening the power to resist infection. 
Hence preventive vaccination should 
be undertaken before the usual time 
that epidemics appear. Persons vac- 
cinated should take the strictest pre- 
cautions to avoid the chance of ty- 
phoid infection by carefully boiling 
all water that is drunk and cleansing 
the food that is eaten and by rigor- 
ous personal hygiene and cleanliness. 
These precautions need only be taken 
during a period of two or three 
weeks at most. No one sliould be 
vaccinated who has been exposed to 
typhoid fever or during the begin- 
ning of an attack. In such cases 
vaccination may aggravate the dis- 
ease. It should be practiced only 



upon perfectly healthy subjects, free 
from all organic or other defects and 
from local or general ailments no 
matter what their nature, especially 
tuberculosis. The vaccination of de- 
bilitated or delicate i)ersons should 
be avoided. Anti-typhoid vaccina- 
tion is especially recommended for 
physicians, internes, medical stu- 
dents, male and female nurses in hos- 
pitals; persons, members of families 
in which bacillus carriers have been 
found; and the population of locali- 
ties where the disease is frequent, 
especially young persons of both 
sexes who have recently come to such 
localities from more salubrious reg- 
ions. 

MALARIA 

This is a germ disease produced by 
a parasite belonging to the very low- 
est order of animal life. It attacks 
and destroys the red cells of the 
blood. It also produces a toxin or 
poison that causes the characteristic 
symptoms of the disease. 

Symptoms. — The most common 
and well-rccognized symptoms occur 
in the cases known as malarial or 
intermittent fever, fever and ague, 
or chills and fever. Chilly sensations 
occur at intervals for several days 
together with a feeling of fullness in 
the head and general bodily depres- 
sion. Then come chills followed by 
a high fever, with subsequent profuse 
perspiration. After a few hours the 
patient returns to a normal condition 
and feels about as usual until the next 
attack occurs. The paroxysms of 
chills and fever occur at various in- 
tervals depending u]ion t!ie particu- 
lar parasite which produces them. A 
common form is that which produces 
a chill every other day. Or there 
may be a continuous slow fever, or 
attacks of fever at irregular intervals. 
In severe cases the brain becomes 
affected and the malady often termi- 
nates in chronic Bright's disease. 

Treatment. — Home doctoring is 
often thought sufficient for malaria, 
quinine usually being considered a 
specific. But the constitutional ef- 
fects of this disease are so serious 
that a physician should be consulted 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 569 



and his recommendations implicitly 
followed. 

Prevention. — The germ or parasite 
which causes malaria can be com- 
municated to man only by the bite 
of the Anopheles mosquito. This 
species has a body which is placed 
parallel to and almost on the same 
plane with the front portions of the 
insect. Hence, when at rest on walls 
or other objects, the back portion 
sticks out almost or quite at right 
angles with the surface upon which 
it is resting. The back portion of 
the common mosquito forms an angle 
with the front part of its body. 
Hence both ends of the mosquito 
point toward the object upon which 
it rests. There are other differences 
that clearly differentiate the malarial 
from the common mosquito, but the 
one given serves to distinguish be- 
tween them. The malarial mosquito 
is preeminently a house gnat. It is 
scarcely ever seen in the woods or 
open, but may be found oftentimes 
in great numbers in all malarial lo- 
calities, lying quietly during the day 
in dark corners of rooms or stables. 
This mosquito practically never bites 
in the day, but will do so in a dark- 
ened room, if a person will remain 
perfectly quiet. Their favorite time 
for feeding is in the early part of the 
night and about daybreak. This ac- 
counts for the fact, long observed, 
that malarial fever is almost invari- 
ably contracted at night. 

The malarial mosquito bites and 
then goes back to some dark corner 
where it remains quiescent for forty- 
eight hours. Then it again comes 
out to feed. Contrary to the gen- 
eral opinion mosquitoes bite many 
times. They frequently remain alive 
for months. The malarial mosquito, 
particularly, oftentimes lives in cel- 
lars and attics throughout the entire 
winter. If one of these mosquitoes 
bites a person with malaria, the para- 
sites are sucked in along with the 
blood. They pass into the stomach 
of the gnat and make their way ulti- 
mately into the body substance. Here 
the parasites undergo a series of mul- 
tiphcations. A single bacterium 
sometimes produces as many as ten 
thousand young malarial parasites. 



After these have developed fully, 
which requires eight days in warm 
weather, they make their way into 
the venom gland of the mosquito. 
Here they remain until it bites. They 
are then injected into the body of 
the individual attacked along with 
the poison. 

After getting into the human 
blood, each parasite attacks a red 
blood cell, bores into it, and grows 
at the expense of the cell until it 
reaches maturity. It then divides up 
into from seven to twenty-five young 
parasites which are liberated and 
each in turn attacks a new cell. Tliis 
process goes on until a sufficient num- 
ber of parasites are produced in the 
individual to cause the symptoms of 
malaria. The new subject of the dis- 
ease thereafter becomes a source of 
danger to others in the vicinity 
through the intervention of still other 
malarial mosquitoes. 

Hence the proper way to avoid 
malaria is to screen houses so that 
mosquitoes cannot enter them. Per- 
sons in malarial districts should not 
sit on open porches at night. They 
should also be very careful to sleep 
under properly constructed nets. If 
these measures are taken there is ab- 
solutely no danger of any one ever 
contracting the disease. These pre- 
cautions are not necessary in the day- 
time. 

Those who have the disease are a 
constant source of danger to people 
living in the vicinity. Hence they 
should be doubly careful to avoid be- 
ing bitten by mosquitoes at night. 
They should vigorously treat the dis- 
ease until the parasites are no longer 
present in their bodies. They then 
cease to be a menace to others. 

Many children have malaria with- 
out showing symptoins. If allowed 
to sleep without being properly cov- 
ered with a net, they are very apt 
to infect a large number of malarial 
mosquitoes. The blood of children in 
malarial localities should be examined 
from time to time. If the parasites 
be found they should be given the 
proper remedies until a cure is ef- 
fected. 

Almost all negroes in malarial lo- 
calities harbor tlie parasites, though 



670 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



very few of them show symptoms of 
their presence. It is, therefore, very 
important that they be treated prop- 
erly. Their white neighbors should 
see to it, for their own safety, that 
negroes do not sleep in houses un- 
protected by nets. 

If the precautions herein detailed 
were properly carried out every- 
where for even a few months, malaria 
would practically cease to e.\ist. Nor 
could it recur in any locality until 
individuals suffering from the dis- 
ease imported it from other places. 

Yellow Fever. — Yellow fever like 
malaria can be communicated to man 
only by the bites of mosquitoes, in 
this case the Stegomyia Calopus va- 
riety. From the standpoint of pre- 
ventive medicine the procedure indi- 
cated for the two diseases is entirely 
similar. 

TUBERCULOSIS OR CONSUMPTION 

A nation-wide campaign has been 
set on foot for the extermination of 
consumption — often called " The 
Great White Plague " — the ravages 
of which justify the characterization 
of this disease as "the captain of the 
men of death." Several voluntary 
associations are engaged in this cam- 
paign and a number of the great in- 
surance companies are giving their 
active cooperation. The following 
is a summary of the latest scientific 
information upon this subject pre- 
pared under the supervision of the 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Com- 
pany of New York: 

Its Nature. — This disease, known 
also as " phthisis," is caused by a 
living germ, called the " bacillus tu- 
berculosis," which multiplies with 
great rapidity. The germ is called 
'■ bacillus " because it resembles a lit- 
tle rod, this being the meaning of the 
word " bacillus." 

Outside of the human body, the 
germ may live in warm, moist, dark 
places for a long time. By direct 
sunlight the germ is killed in a few 
hours, in a few days by ordinary day- 
light, and immediately by boiling wa- 
ter. If the germ finds its way into 
the lungs it rapidly increases in num- 
ber. A strong, healthy person will 



resist the germs, but in an individual 
who is weak, they rapidly multiply 
until the lungs are consumed and 
the person dies. 

The germ generally obtains access 
to the body through the mouth, and 
most frequently lodges in the air 
passages of the lungs. It may, how- 
ever, get into the glands of the neck, 
attack the throat, the bowels, the 
kidneys, the brain, or any other or- 
gan of the body as well as the bones 
of the joints. Fortunately, strong, 
healthy people possess the power of 
resisting these germs, otherwise it is 
likely that the disease would kill off 
whole communities. Nearly every- 
body at some period of his life 
breathes in the Uving germs of the 
disease, but owing to the power of 
resistance of a healthy body they are 
not able to multiply. If they do not 
immediately die they produce little 
lumps called " tubercles," from which 
conies the name "tuberculosis." If 
these form in the lungs, they con- 
tinue to grow, soften, break open, 
and are eventually expelled by cough- 
ing or otherwise. For this reason, 
the sputum, or " spit," of an individ- 
ual who has consumption is filled with 
the germs of tuberculosis. 

In early stages of the disease the 
germ is found in small numbers in 
the sputum, in larger numbers as 
the disease progresses, and in count- 
less millions in the later stages. Un- 
less this sputum is destroyed by 
burning or by disinfectants, it may 
become the most common method of 
carrying tuberculosis to other in- 
dividuals. 

Not Hereditary. — It is generally 
believed now that consumption is not 
inherited. It is true that the children 
of consumptives are frequently of 
low vitalitj' and generally of poor 
physique. This does not mean, how- 
ever, that they are bound to become 
consumptives. Tliey will get con- 
sumption only if the germ enters 
their body. Being weak, however, 
and being unable to resist the action 
of the bacillus, they are more sus- 
ceptible than individuals who are 
physically well and strong. There is 
no reason whatever why such chil- 
dren, if properly cared for, should 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 571 



not grow to healthy and well-devel- 
oped men and women who will never 
be consumptive. 

It is possible to have the disease 
for some time and not know it or 
suspect it. An examination of the 
patient's chest by a competent physi- 
cian and a microscopical examination 
of the sputum may discover it, but 
if both of these tests fail, it does not 
definitely mean that tuberculosis is 
not present. 

Repeated examinations should be 
made from time to time if the earlier 
symptoms of tuberculosis are present. 
Among these (if they are present, 
the individual should consult a physi- 
cian at once) are the following: 
Slight cough, lasting a month or 
longer; loss of weight; slight fever, 
each afternoon; bleeding from the 
lungs; tired feeling. We repeat, if 
tliese sjTnptoms are present, do not 
delay, but consult a physician at once. 

From what has been said above, it 
will be seen that as consumption is a 
germ disease, it is a communicable 
disease and as such a preventable dis- 
ease. If it is treated properly in its 
early stages it is a curable disease. 

The Extent of the Disease. — Tu- 
berculosis is the great disease of mid- 
dle life. It causes about one-third of 
all the deaths that occur between the 
ages of twenty and fifty years. More 
deaths result from consumption than 
from any other disease. It is esti- 
mated that two hundred thousand 
people die each year in the United 
States from tuberculosis. Between 
the ages of fifteen and forty-five 
years, one-third of all deaths are 
from tuberculosis. Between the ages 
of twenty and thirty-five, one-half of 
all deaths are from tuberculosis. 
During the four years of the Civil 
War, the total loss of life was two 
hundred and five thousand and 
seventy. In the same time, the tu- 
bercle bacillus destroyed in the 
Ignited States alone over seven hun- 
dred thousand people. 

When we hear of yellow fever, we 
make every possible effort to stamp 
out the disease at once. The same is 
true of smallpox and other so-called 
contagious diseases, and j'et it is es- 
timated that the total number of 



deaths from yellow fever in the 
United States during one hundred 
years was only one hundred thou- 
sand. The annual economic loss 
from consumption in the United 
States is $330,000,000. 

The Spread of the Disease. — The 
great medium for the spread of the 
disease is the consumptive's spit. 
When the consumptive coughs or 
sneezes, he fills the air before him 
with particles of moisture, almost too 
small to be seen, which are filled with 
germs. When he spits upon the floor, 
or the walk, millions of germs are 
deposited, and are ready to find their 
way upon the clothes or hands and 
thus into the mouths and into the 
lungs, stomach and intestines of chil- 
dren who play upon the floor, or 
walk. The careless consumptive's 
handkerchief, the pocket in which he 
carries it, the bedding, especially the 
pillow cover, and the towel used by 
him, are laden with germs. 

When a member of the family has 
consumption and the spit is not care- 
fully collected and destroyed, the 
house is apt to become infected and 
other members of the family take the 
disease. 

When a consumptive removes or 
dies, and other persons move into 
the house, some of them are very apt 
to take the disease unless the house 
is thoroughly cleaned and disinfect- 
ed, particularly the floors and walls. 

Impure air and deficient sunlight 
favor the development of the bacil- 
lus. For this reason a consumptive 
is more frequently met with in the 
crowded parts of cities, where houses 
are built closely together, air cannot 
circulate freely, and sunlight does 
not enter. Overcrowded, poorly ven- 
tilated houses, offices and workshops, 
all tend to spread the disease. Con- 
sumption is much less common where 
people live in separate houses. 

Dirt, dampness and darkness are 
three of the most active allies of the 
tuberculosis germ. On the other 
hand, sunshine, pure air and cleanli- 
ness are its greatest enemies. It is 
highly desirable for this reason that 
you keep your home perfectly clean 
and constantly remove from it dust 
and dirt. Every room should have a 



5n 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



thorough spring and fall house clean- 
ing each year. Hooins which have 
been occupied by consumptives fre- 
quently become infected with the 
germs. Such rooms should never be 
used without having been previously 
disinfected. Remember that the most 
active agent for spreading tubercu- 
losis is the spit of the consumptive. 
If this is thoroughly burned or de- 
stroyed at once, there is little dan- 
ger of infection. 

If the body is weakened by over- 
work, or by dissipation or by excesses 
of any kind, the individual is more 
apt to contract tuberculosis than if 
he keeps himself strong and well. In 
fact, healthy persons, living a proper 
life, when infected frequently get 
over the disease so quickly and so 
readily that they do not even know 
that they have had it. 

People addicted to the use of alco- 
hol in any form are more likely to 
have tuberculosis than others. 

The Cure of the Disease. — Con- 
sumption is no longer the hopeless 
disease of the past — it is curable. 
The earlier it is detected in an in- 
dividual case, the surer the cure. 
Therefore, help your friend, your 
neighbor, your relative, to recognize 
and treat his disease at the start. 

If you should be unfortunate 
enough to be afflicted with tubercu- 
losis or consumption, first of all get 
the advice of a reliable physician, and 
follow his instructions conscientiously 
and religiously. There is no anti- 
toxin for treating tuberculosis such 
as is used for diphtheria. The only 
cure we know for tuberculosis is to 
increase the bodily strength, so that 
the body will resist and gradually de- 
stroy the germ. This is a slow proc- 
ess. Its principal means are plenty 
of fresh air all the time, plenty of 
good food, rest, freedom from worry 
and out-of-door life. Medicines are 
of comparatively little use in the cure 
of consumption. Patent medicines 
do not cure consumption. Most of 
them are alcoholic drinks in disguise, 
which are dangerous to the consump- 
tive. 

Sanatoria. — For the best treatment 
of tuberculosis, so as to afford the 
patient outdoor treatment as much 



as possible, special hospitals, called 
sanatoria, have been erected in all 
l)arts of the United States and Eu- 
rope. It is highly desirable, in order 
to cure the consumptive as rapidly as 
possible, tliat he be treated in such 
a sanatorium. There are, however, 
as yet not sufficient of these to ac- 
commodate everybody, and for this 
and for other reasons it is frequently 
necessary for the patient to be treat- 
ed at home. If the latter method be 
resorted to, it should be done under 
the advice of a physician. 

Home Treatment! — The physician 
will tell you how to carry on this 
home treatment in the best manner. 
A person who has pulmonary tuber- 
culosis, or consumption, is not dan- 
gerous to have in the house if he is 
careful and clean, and if he follows 
the usual rules laid down to prevent 
infection of other members of the 
family. The patient's window should 
be open day and night and he should 
occupy the room alone. Preferably 
there should be no carpet or rug on 
the floor. The sheets and the body 
linen should be frequently washed 
and well boiled. The room should be 
dusted with a damp cloth, or a damp 
broom. The food which he eats 
should be used by him exclusively 
and should be well boiled. 

The Prevention of the Disease. — 
To prevent consumption, two things 
are required: (1) the removal of the 
source of contagion; (2) the removal 
of the predisposing cause. These 
can be accomplished, (1) by collect- 
ing and destroying the germs in the 
consumptive's sjiit, and (2) by keep- 
ing the body in good general health, 
so that it will be able to resist the 
germs. 

The consumptive, if he carefully 
destroys all his spit, is harmless. He 
should preferably use paper napkins, 
which can be burned immediately. 
They should not be carried loose in 
the pocket after using. "When cough- 
ing or sneezing, he should hold one of 
these before his mouth. If the 
handkerchief is ever used for this 
purpose it should be immediately dis- 
infected, by being placed either in 
boiling water or in a 3 per cent, solu- 
tion of carbolic acid. 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 573 



He should spit into a pasteboard 
sputum cup, which at the end of 
each day can be burned, or into a 
vessel which can be easily and com- 
pletely cleaned dailj'. The ordinary 
spittoon is most difficult to clean and 
should never be used by a consump- 
tive. When the consumptive is at 
work, riding on the street car, or 
traveling, he should use a pocket 
sputum cup or flask which can be 
kept tightly closed until he can 
empty it at night. 

The Careful Consumptive is Not 
Dangerous. — Tuberculosis is not con- 
tagious by the breath (except when 
the consumptive coughs or sneezes), 
or in the same way as smallpox, or 
diphtheria,, or scarlet fever, but 
through the sputum. 

Even though every effort is made 
to collect and destroy the germ it 
is probable that every one of us, on 
account of the prevalence of the dis- 
ease and the large number of con- 
sumptives who are careless or do not 
understand the importance of de- 
stroying their si^it, will recei%'e at 
some time or other the germs in our 
lungs. It is most important, there- 
fore, that the lungs be in proper 
condition and that the general health 
be good. 

Thorough ventilation of bedrooms 
is one of the most important means 
to this end. Too often the bedroom 
is small, dark and unventilatcd, the 
windows sometimes being nailed shut. 
To nail one's bedroom window shut 
is to drive a nail in one's coffin. We 
spend more hours each day in our 
bedrooms than in any other room in 
the house, yet they are usually the 
smallest, worst lighted, and least ven- 
tilated. 

Sleeping out of doors is urged 
upon the consumptive, and it is prob- 
able that most of us would be in 
far better condition to resist tuber- 
culosis if we slept on out-of-door 
sleeping porches a good portion of the 
year. 

Excessive hours of hard work, 
whether on the farm or in the fac- 
tory, lower the vitality. Insufficient 
food or indigestible food also in- 
jures the health. The steady drink- 
ing of alcoholic liquors, whether or 



not we become drunk, injures the 
body. 

SMALLPOX AND CHICKENPOX 

Smallpox is an acute, contagious, 
infectious disease characterized by 
the well-known eruption of small 
boils or pustules all over the body. 
Varioloid and variola are terms 
sometimes applied to mild cases of 
smallpox under the mistaken impres- 
sion that they are a different and 
less virulent disease. This is not the 
case. The mildest cases communicate 
the disease in its most malignant 
form. Smallpox is sometimes called 
by false names, such as Cuban itch, 
Porto Rico itch, Porto Rico scratches, 
or elephant itch, to conceal its ex- 
istence in the community. There 
are, in fact, no such diseases and 
this practice is most reprehensible. 
Smallpox has all the characteristics 
of a germ disease, but the germ 
which causes it has not yet been iden- 
tified. It may occur at any season 
of the year, but is most prevalent in 
winter. 

History. — No other disease, not ex- 
cepting the bubonic plague or " Black 
Death," has contributed an equally 
interesting chapter to the history of 
mankind. It is known to have pre- 
vailed in the far east many centu- 
ries before the Christian era. ?2u- 
rope was first visited with smallpox 
in the sixth century. Later it was 
widely disseminated by the crusades. 
It depopulated an entire colony in 
Greenland in the thirteenth century, 
contributed largely to the conquest of 
Mexico by Cortez in the sixteenth cen- 
tury, and destroyed far larger num- 
bers of the American Indians than 
did the firearms and fire water of 
the white man. By the eighteenth 
century smallpox was distributed 
throughout Great Britain and the 
continent of Europe. Over 90 per 
cent of the population is said to 
have been affected and about one- 
tenth of the entire mortality was 
caused by this disease. More than 
one-half of all the living are said 
to have been scarred and disfigured 
by it. Historians aver that women 
whose faces were not pockmarked 



574 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



were the exception. Xot a little of 
the great reputation of famous beau- 
ties of this period is said to have 
been due to chance immunity from 
this disease. Smallpox before the 
days of vaccination spared neither 
high nor low. It spread its terrors 
alike in the homes of rich and poor, 
and even penetrated into the ])alaces 
of princes. More than a score of 
deaths in royal families were thus 
caused. A half dozen reigning mon- 
archs were attacked but recovered. 
More than once it threatened the 
total extinction of representative Eu- 
ropean dynasties. George Washing- 
ton, during his early manhood, was 
" strongly attacked by the smallpox " 
while on a visit to the West Indies. 

Smalljiox is now a rare malady and 
is rajjidly vanishing. This great 
change has been wrought in a single 
century by the discovery of vaccina- 
tion on May 14, 1796, by Edward 
Jenner. On that day Jenner per- 
formed the first vaccination on a hu- 
man being. Eight weeks later he 
fearlessly exposed his patient in 
sniaIIj)ox hospitals and brought hira 
into contact with smallpox patients 
without causing him to contract the 
disease. Vaccination has been called 
the greatest discovery ever made for 
the preservation of the human spe- 
cies. Millions of lives have been saved 
by it, and a thorough and continuous 
practice of vaccination will undoubt- 
edly blot out smallpox from the face 
of the earth. 

Jenner's discover}^ was based on a 
widespread belief that persons who 
had become infected with a similar 
disease of cattle, known as cowpox, 
were thereafter immune from small- 
pox infection. A remark made in 
his presence to this effect by a milk- 
maid was the " awakening impulse 
which after years of study and ex- 
periment culminated in the discovery 
which has conferred the greatest 
benefits upon the human race." 

The practice of vaccination up to 
a comparatively recent date was not 
alwaj'^s surrounded by proper sani- 
tary safeguards. The vaccine was 
sometimes impure and sufficient care 
was not always taken to prevent in- 
fection of the sore with the germs 



of tetanus (lockjaw) and other dis- 
eases. The progress of modern 
science has now overcome all these 
dangers. Vaccination at the hands 
of a competent physician is not only 
an entirely safe and almost painless 
operation: it is an absolute preven- 
tive of smallpox and the only possi- 
ble safeguard against its ravages. 
Vaccination against smallpox is com- 
pulsory u])on all inhabitants by law ^ 
in Germany and Japan. In both 
countries it has been practically 
stamped out. The vaccination of 
school children is compulsory by regu- 
lation of the school board or board 
of health in many American cities, 
but is not enjoined upon the general 
public by state or national legisla- 
tion. Hence sporadic outbreaks are 
constantly occurring. The disease in- 
variably attacks persons who have 
never been vaccinated and may also 
attack those who were vaccinated in 
childhood, but have not been revac- 
cinated after an interval of ten or 
more years. In such cases, however, 
the disease assumes a milder form. 

Opposition to compulsory vaccina- 
tion when not due to mere ignorance 
or prejudice is based upon one of 
the following grounds: i. e., (1) that 
vaccination does not protect, (2) 
that it may transmit other diseases 
or is otherwise harmful or dangerous, 
or (3) that compulsory vaccination 
is an invasion of the rights of an 
individual. The experience of Ja])an 
and Germany, and especially the im- 
munity of the German army as the 
result of vaccination during the 
Franco-Prussian war, 1870-1 (when 
the opposing French army was rav- 
aged by smallpox), and the universal 
testimony of expert sanitarians, 
proves that the first of these objec- 
tions is totally unfoimdcd. 

The chance that vaccination may 
transmit other diseases, or otherwise 
proves injurious to the patient has 
now been entirely overcome. Arm 
to arm vaccination was formerly the 
custom, i. e., the scab from a suc- 
cessful vaccination was used as a 
vaccine for others. Occasionally such 
diseases as tuberculosis and syphilis 
were transmitted in this way. But 
this method is a practice of the past. 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 575 



The only vaccine now employed is 
prepared from healthy young calves 
under Government supervision. It is 
true that there is the possibility of 
blood poisoning or lockjaw if the 
sore become infected. But this will 
not occur if the vaccination is prop- 
erly performed and protected by a 
suitable dressing. The danger from 
this source is much less than that 
from pricks and scratches from 
thorns or minute splinters, or the 
claws of domestic pets. In a word, 
the possible danger from vaccination 
is grossly exaggerated. Pure vac- 
cine is harmless and it is doubtful 
whether a single death has been 
caused by vaccination conducted in 
a proper manner. 

The notion that compulsory vac- 
cination is an invasion of the rights 
of an individual might be sustained 
if a person could suffer from the 
disease without requiring the care of 
other members of society, and sub- 
jecting them to the dangers of in- 
fection. The loathsomeness of small- 
pox, the helplessness of the suf- 
ferer and the necessity of providing 
pesthouses for the treatment of pa- 
tients of this disease bring the sub- 
ject of vaccination well within the 
police power of state and nation. 
Every effort should be made to 
arouse public sentiment in favor of 
a state and national compulsory vac- 
cination law. 

A Vaccination Creed. — Many 
years ago the Department of Health 
of Chicago made the following dec- 
laration of their faith in vaccina- 
tion: 

" First. — That true vaccination — 
repeated until it no longer ' takes ' — 
always prevents smallpox. Nothing 
else does. 

" Second. — That true vaccination — 
that is, vaccination properly done on 
a clean arm with pure lymph and 
kept perfectly clean and unbroken 
afterwards — never did and never will 
make a serious sore. 

" Third. — That such a vaccination 
leaves a characteristic scar, unlike 
that from any other cause, which is 
recognizable during life, and is the 
only conclusive evidence of a suc- 
cessful vaccination. 



" Fourth. — That no untoward re- 
sults ever follow such vaccination; 
on the other hand thousands of lives 
are annually sacrificed through the 
neglect to vaccinate — a neglect be- 
gotten of lack of knowledge." 

How to Vaccinate. — vaccination 
should, as a rule, be performed only 
by a competent physician, but may 
be safely performed by anyone if 
the following instructions are care- 
fully observed: Secure the pure vac- 
cine from a first-class drug store, or 
if there is no drug store in the vicin- 
ity, write or telegraph the state board 
of health at the capital city of your 
state, and ask them to forward 
through the mails enough vaccine for 
the required number of persons. If 
buying from a drug store ask for 
glycerinized lymph. It is both safer 
and more reliable than the vaccine 
from dried points. A good plan is to 
make the inoculation on the inside of 
the arm above the elbow where the 
scar will be out of sight. But if pre- 
ferred, the wound may be made on 
the leg or, indeed, on any part of the 
body. The part should be thoroughly 
washed with soap and hot water'. 
Then rinse with a 50 per cent solution 
of alcohol. But this must be allowed 
to fully evaporate. Otherwise it may 
kill the vaccine. The operator's 
hands should be thoroughly scrubbed 
with hot water and soap, preferably 
carbolic or green soap, with especial 
attention to the finger nails. If the 
virus comes on bone points, it is best 
not to use a knife at all. Scrape the 
parts with the point over a spot about 
as large as the little finger nail, imtil 
the upper layers of the skin have been 
rubbed away and serum appears and 
mingles with the virus which thus 
gains entrance into the system. If a 
knife is used for scarifying the parts 
thoroughly disinfect it in standard 
solution No. 4, carbolic acid (5 per 
cent) and afterwards rinse free of 
the antiseptic solution in boiling 
water. In either case dry the parts 
thoroughly before the operation is 
attempted. If the knife is used, scar- 
ify very lightly and stop as soon as 
the serum appears and before the red 
blood commences to flow. If the 
wound is deep enough to draw blood 



676 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



there is much more danger of infec- 
tion and, moreover, the flow of blood 
tends to wash the virus away. 

When the scrum begins to run, rub 
in the vaccine with the knife or vac- 
cine point. If the virus is dry, first 
dip the point in tepid water which 
has been freshly boiled. After the 
virus has been thoroughly rubbed in, 
leave the scar uncovered until it is 
dry. Now cover the wound with an- 
tiseptic gauze or sterilized gauze, or 
cotton, and bandage with great care 
so that the bandage will not get out 
of place and the wound become in- 
fected. The best plan, after covering 
the wound with gauze, is to cover the 
gauze and adjacent parts with strips 
of adhesive surgeon's plaster. The 
dressing should be changed every day 
or two until the scab falls off. Sani- 
tary precautions must be taken at 
every dressing to avoid infecting the 
wound. 

If the vaccination "takes" a small 
red spot appears at the site of in- 
oculation on the third day. The tem- 
perature rises slightly on the third 
or fourth day, and may continue a 
little above normal until the eighth 
or ninth day. On the eleventh or 
twelfth day the soreness begins to 
subside and a brownish scab forms 
over the wound. This becomes dry 
and hard and falls off on the twenty- 
first to the twenty-fifth day. It 
leaves a circular pitted scar. The 
sore must be kept clean and free 
from irritation and disturbance. It 
must not be rubbed or scratched. If, 
after six or seven days there is an 
undue degree of inflammation, a 
physician should be consulted. Prac- 
tically every case of ill effects from 
vaccination is due to scratching or 
picking at the sore, or otherwise 
handling or dressing it with dirty 
hands or fingers. 

A successful vaccination usually 
confers immimity from smallpox for 
life. In other cases the power of re- 
sistance seems to decrease with time. 
Hence adults vaccinated in childhood 
should be revaccinated if exposed to 
smallpox or if an epidemic of the 
disease breaks out in a community. 
The second vaccination will " take " 
only on those who need it. 



When to Vaccinate. — Every child 
should be vaccinated during the first 
year and again at the age of puberty, 
i. e., twelve or fourteen years of age. 
If a case of .smallpox occurs in the 
family or neighborhood, or even if it ■ 

is known to exist in the community, 1 
every member of the family should be 
promptly revaccinated. Inoculation 
within three days after exposure has 
been found to give immunity, and if 
performed as late as the fifth day the 
attack will be averted or much modi- 
fied. This is especially the case when 
revaccination is performed. In one 
recorded case a mother and three 
small children were vaccinated after 
the father was taken down with the 
smallpox. Tlie wife nursed her hus- 
band duriner the disease and took care 
of her children, but no other member 
of the family became infected. 

Symptoms.' — The period of incuba- 
tion varies from 7 to 20 days, the 
average being 12 days. Inoculation 
shortens the time to* 7 or 8 days. 
During this period the symptoms are 
very slight. The invasion of the dis- 
ease is sudden. It begins with a 
chill which may be followed by oth- 
ers. There is severe aching in the 
small of the back, sometimes in the 
limbs, intense headache, vomiting and 
fever. The pulse is rapid and strong. 
Convulsions often occur in children. 
An initial rash in the form of a dif- 
fused redness somewhat similar to 
the rash of scarlet fever occurs in 
a few cases on the second day. The 
distinctive eruption appears on the 
third day on the forehead, around the 
mouth, and on the wrists. Now the 
temperature, which has been continu- 
ously high, begins to fall. With- 
in twenty-four hours the eruption 
spreads all over the body, and at this 
stage the disease strongly resembles 
measles. On the fourth and fifth 
days the eruption is papular and a 
characteristic " shottv " sensation is 
obtained by passing the fingers over 
the skin. 

In the milder cases commonly 
called varioloid or variola, the fever 
falls at once after the appearance 
of the eruption on the tiiird or fourth 
day, and the patient feels comfort- 
able. The eruption is slight, scat- 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 577 



tered, and often limited to the face 
and hands. 

There is danger that this disease 
may be mistaken for measles, scarlet 
fever, chickenpox or some other in- 
fection. The characteristic symp- 
toms are the severity of the attack 
together with chills, backache, head- 
ache and vomiting. The presence of 
these symptoms associated with a 
high fever from 10-2.-2 to 10.8 F. 
continuing for three or four days 
and falling on the appearance of an 
eruption should excite suspicion of 
smallpox, especially when the disease 
is prevalent. 

The symptoms of measles have 
been described elsewhere. The erup- 
tion occurs about the fourth or fifth 
day without the fall of temperature 
which is characteristic of smallpox. 
In scarlet fever the eruption ap- 
pears on the second day and gradu- 
ally fades after two or three days. 

Chickenpox (Varicella). — This is a 
mild disease of children of impor- 
tance chiefly because the mild cases 
of smallpox may be mistaken for this 
disease. Chickenpox is ordinarily 
confined to children under six years 
of age. The initial symptoms are 
much milder than smallpox, although 
there may be fever, vomiting and 
pains in the back and legs. The 
eruption appears during the first 
twenty-four hours on the back, chest, 
or face in the form of red pimples 
which in a few hours become filled 
with a clear or turbid fluid. In three 
or four days the eruption dries up 
into scabs which soon fall ofi'. There 
is little or no scarring. 

Prognosis of Smallpox. — From the 
sixth to the eighth day after the on- 
set of the disease the vesicles change 
to pustules with a slight depression 
in the center surrounded by a red 
border or halo. The temperature 
rises again, what is known as the 
secondary fever sets in, and the gen- 
eral symptoms return. Pustules are 
especially thick on the face which 
is much swollen and disfigured. On 
the twelfth or thirteenth day, about 
four or five days from their first 
appearance, the pustules begin to dry 
up. A few days later the scabs be- 
gin to fall off first from the face and 



later from other parts of the body. 
The temperature falls to normal and 
convalescence begins. 

Or, in severe cases such as the con- 
fluent form or hemorrhagic smallpox, 
the symptoms become more severe 
and death occurs, usually at the state 
of maturation, about the tenth or 
eleventh day. When recovery takes 
place, the process of desquamation, 
or peeling off of the scales, is usually 
completed in three or four weeks, 
but may extend to six or eight weeks. 

Modes of Infection. — The virus of 
smalljjox has an extraordinary vitali- 
ty. Infected clothing and other ar- 
ticles may transmit the disease after 
an interval of months or even years. 
Contagion may be direct from con- 
tact with the patient, or may be car- 
ried from the sick room on the per- 
son or clothing of the nurse or physi- 
cian or by means of bedding and 
other articles. All who enter the 
sick room should wear a washable 
hooded gown. This should be disin- 
fected on leaving the room as else- 
where recommended. After leaving 
the room the hands, face and hair 
should be washed in a disinfectant 
solution. The contagion exists in all 
the secretions and excretions of the 
body, and the exhalations from the 
lungs and perspiration. The pus 
from the pustules is the most fertile 
source of contagion and the dust 
from dried pus scales is the usual 
medium of its dissemination. The 
disease is most contagious while the 
eruption is in active progress, but 
begins to be contagious before the 
eruption appears and so continues 
until the process of scaling is com- 
plete. 

ftuarantirie. — As soon as the case 
is known to be smallpox, convey the 
patient if practicable to a hospital 
or pesthouse, or isolate in a sick 
room prepared in all respects as for 
typhoid fever. Placard the premises. 
Vaccinate every member of the fam- 
ily. Allow no one to leave the liouse 
until the vaccination " takes " or it 
appears that the person is immune 
by reason of previous vaccination. 
The bread-winners may then leave the 
premises, after proper disinfection 
under the advice of a physician or 



578 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



public health officer, but must board 
and room elsewhere during the prog- 
ress of the disease. Do not allow the 
nurse and other members of the fam- 
ily to leave the premises or mingle 
with other persons. All members of 
the family who have been success- 
fully vaccinated and revaccinated at 
the outbreak of the disease will be 
inmiune. They are in no danger 
from the disease themselves, but 
should not come in contact with other 
persons as they may communicate 
the disease on their person or cloth- 
ing. Household pets, flies and in- 
sects should be rigidly excluded from 
the premises. No visitors should be 
admitted under any pretext. Every 
sanitary precaution described under 
typhoid fever should be observed 
with redoubled vigilance on account 
of the virulence of the germs. All 
excreta should be thoroughly disin- 
fected and afterwards buried. After 
the recovery or death of the patient, 
not only the sick room but every 
room in the dwelling should be thor- 
oughly fumigated with formalde- 
hyde or sulphur or preferably with 
both. 

Quarantines should be observed un- 
til the process of desquamation is 
complete. The length of time will 
depend entirely on the individual 
case. A safe rule is to await the 
disappearance of the peculiar red 
specks at the bottom of the pits or 
scars. As long as these spots are 
visible the desquamation is going 
on. 

HOOKWORM DISEASE 

This disease has existed from time 
immemorial, but especial attention 
has been directed to it in the United 
States in recent years. Investiga- 
tions by Dr. Chas. Wardell Stiles of 
the United States Public Health and 
Marine Hospital Service and those 
made under the supervision of the 
Rockefeller Institution, have proved 
that this disease is widely prevalent, 
es])ecially in the southern states, and 
is of enormous economic importance. 
It is caused by soil pollution. The 
eggs and larvae of the hookworm are 
passed in large numbers in the dis- 



charges of infected persons. Thence 
they may be communicated to others 
by contaminated food or water or 
directly from the soil through the 
skin. This mode of infection is per- 
haps the most common in rural dis- 
tricts where all children and many 
adult members of the population go 
barefoot in summer and are thus 
more or less constantly in contact 
with infected soil. In the rural sec- 
tions of the southern states all the 
factors necessary for the propaga- 
tion of this disease are found. The 
conditions most favorable to its de- 
velopment are w^armth, moisture, an 
open porous soil and infected people 
who pollute the soil. North of the 
Ohio and Potomac Rivers the climate 
is too cold and in the arid west too 
dry to favor the disease. 

The adult hookworm is about one- 
third or two-thirds of an inch in 
length and about the thickness of a 
small hairpin, or a No. 30 thread. 
Its head bends back on its neck like 
a hook, hence the name. The mouth 
is equipped witli lances which pierce 
the flesh and make openings through 
which the blood can escape. These 
carry a poisonous secretion from a 
gland in the worm's head which 
keeps the blood from clotting. In 
severe cases, the worms occur in 
enormous numbers and take large 
quantities of blood from the system. 
Much more is lost from constant ooz- 
ing of the wounds. The secretion 
injected by the worm is poisonous 
and causes a chronic inflammation 
which impairs digestion. The wound 
also affords entrance for disease- 
producing bacteria to the system. 
There is also a general lowering of 
the body tone which exposes the vic- 
tim to all sorts of diseased condi- 
tions. 

The symptoms in general are those 
of malnutrition ana may be mild, 
medium or severe. In general the 
patient becomes very much weak- 
ened, the body looks bloodless and 
development is stunted. The prover- 
bial laziness of the Georgia " crack- 
er " and other so-called " poor 
whites " in southern states is now be- 
lieved to be the result of hookworm 
infection. 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 579 



Treatment and Prevention. — Hap- 
pily this disease may be readily and 
quickly cured and is entirely pre- 
ventable. The following method of 
treatment is advised by Dr. Stiles, 
the leading authority on the subject. 
He says: 

" The fundamental principle under- 
lying the treatment of hookworm dis- 
ease is the same as that which under- 
lies the treatment of all other zoo- 
parasitic diseases, namely, first treat 
the parasite, not the patient. After 
the parasite is treated, attention 
may be directed to treating the pa- 
tient. 

" Although hookworm disease may 
occur in persons in any walk of life, 
it is particularly among the poorer 
classes that it is found, and the 
average hookworm patient (children 
excepted, to a certain extent) can 
not afford to lose several days' wages 
to undergo treatment. It is there- 
fore frequently expedient to conduct 
the treatment Saturday evenings and 
Sunday mornings. It will often be 
found difficult to arouse the interest 
of a comnumity in regard to the 
presence of hookworm disease and 
the need of treatment. This can fre- 
quently be done however, if it is 
borne in mind that the resulting anae- 
mia is, in common with other anae- 
mias, a frequent cause of amenor- 
rhea. 

Warning. — " Notwithstanding that 
primarily we are to treat the para- 
site, not the patient, it should be re- 
membered that if too great a quan- 
tity of thymol is absorbed by the pa- 
tient, alarming symptoms and even 
death may occur. Accordingly, the 
patient and the patient's family 
should be carefully warned not to 
permit the patient under any circum- 
stances to have on the Sunday during 
which the treatment is given any 
food or drink containing alcohol, 
fats, or oil. Patent medicines should 
be mentioned in particular, because 
of the alcohol many of them contain, 
and even milk and butter should be 
forbidden. I know of one case of 
serious thymol poisoning which fol- 
lowed promptly after the patient 
took a copious drink of milk the day 
thymol was taken. 



Preliminary Treatment. — " On Sat- 
urday evening give a dose of Epsom 
salts. The reason is this: The hook- 
worms are surrounded by more or 
less mucus and partially digested 
food. Unless this is removed, the 
thymol may not reach the parasites, 
but may reach the patient, and this 
is contrary to what is desired, as 
thymol is intended for the parasite, 
not the patient. 

Thymol Treatment on Sunday. — 
"Position of patient: Instruct the 
patient to lie on his right side im- 
mediately before taking the drug and 
to remain in that position for at 
least half an hour. The reason for 
this is that many of these patients 
have enlarged stomachs, and if they 
lie on their right side, the drug has 
the benefit of gravity in passing rap- 
idly from the stomach to the intes- 
tine; but if any other position is 
assumed the drug may remain in 
the dilated cardiac portion of the 
stomach for some hours and result 
in considerable complaint on the part 
of the patient and delay of the drug 
reaching the worms. 

" Time of dosage : The time of giv- 
ing and size of dose should be ar- 
ranged on one of two plans, depend- 
ing on existing conditions. 

" The i^Ian usually followed is : At 
6 a. m., one-half of the total dose 
of thymol; at 8 a. m., one-half of the 
total dose of thymol; at 10 a. m., 
Epsom salts (never castor oil). 

" If the case is an especially severe 
one, or if the patient has, upon the 
first Sunday's treatment, complained 
of burning or other effects of thymol, 
the following plan is adopted: At 
6 a. m., one-third of the total dose 
of thymol; at 7 a. m., one-third of 
the total dose of thymol; at 8 a. m., 
one-third of the total dose of thy- 
mol (if unpleasant symptoms, as a 
sensation of severe burning in the 
stomach, have appeared tliis third 
dose should be omitted); at 10 a. m., 
Epsom salts (never castor oil). 

" Food : No food is allowed until 
after the 10 o'clock dose of Epsom 
salts, but the patient is permitted to 
take a glass or so of water after the 
thymol, if he desires. 

"Thymol: Finely powdered thy- 



580 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



mol in capsules, preferably in five- 
grain capsules, should be used. 

"General rule as to age: In the 
table of dosage given in the next 
paragraph, the maximum dose per 
day to be adopted as a routine is 
given for various age groups. In 
determining the dose, however, the 
rule should be followed of taking the 
apparent rather than the real age 
and of not hesitating to cut down the 
dose even lower in case of unusually 
severe cardiac symptoms or other im- 
favorable conditions. Thus for a 
boj" sixteen years old, who appears to 
be only twelve years old, or in whom 
the anaemia is especially marked, 
resulting in severe cardiac svmp- 
toms, the quantity of thymol should 
be reduced to the twelve or even the 
eight-year dose. Some authors give 
the impression that it is useless to 
give thymol for this disease unless 
the full dose is administered. This 
view is not in harmony with my ex- 
perience. 

"Size of dose: Tlie following doses 
represent the maximum amount to 
be used during one daj^'s treatment 
for the age groups in question. It 
is practically the same table that the 
Porto Rican Commission has been 
using: 

Orains. 

Under 5 years old 7^ 

From 5 to 9 years old 15 

From 10 to 14 years old 30 

From 15 to 19 years old 45 

From 20 to 59 years old 60 

Above 60 years old 30 to 45 

Total dose, to be divided as pre- 
viously indicated. 

Repetition of Treatment. — " The 
foregoing treatment is repeated once 
a week, preliminary treatment Satur- 
day evening and thymol on Sunday 
morning, until the patient is dis- 
charged. 

Duration of Treatment. — " To rec- 
ognize whether the parasites are all 
expelled, and therefore to determine 
when to end the thymol treatment, 
either of two plans may be adopted, 
namely : 

"Microscopic examination: On 
Saturday morning make ten micro- 



scopic preparations of a fresh stool. 
If eggs are still present repeat the 
treatment; if eggs are not found, 
discontinue the thymol. It takes 
about forty to sixty minutes to make 
this examination of ten slides thor- 
oughly. 

" Cheese-cloth method : A much 
easier way of recognizing the com- 
pletion of the treatment, and for 
practical results nearly as satisfac- 
tory as the microscopic examination, 
is the following: Instruct the pa- 
tient to wash all of his stools Sun- 
day, Monday and Tuesday, through 
a cheese cloth and to keeji the cheese 
cloth moist and bring it to the office 
on Tuesday. While the fecal ma- 
terial will wash through, the worms 
will be retained in the cloth. Con- 
tinue treatment as long as worms are 
found in the cheese cloth. 

Other Treatment. — " If desired, 
iron may be administered on the days 
on which the thymol is not taken. It 
is a good plan, however, not to give 
iron during the first week, for it is 
quite important to convince the pa- 
tient that the thymol treatment is the 
one which is really accomplishing the 
lasting good. If the drug is taken 
Sunday, the patient is likely to begin 
to feel some benefit by Wednesday 
or Thursday; his family is likely to 
notice it on Thursday or Friday. If 
iron is given during the first week, 
the conclusion may possibly be drawn 
by the patient that it is really the 
iron which is causing the improve- 
ment, and he mav discontinue the 
thymol. Of the two, the thymol is, 
of course, the far more important, 
for it reaches the parasite, while the 
iron reaches only the patient." 

The prevention of hookworm dis- 
ease lies in ])ropcr sanitation to pre- 
vent soil pollution, and especially in 
the construction of sanitary privies. 
State laws to this end, if properly 
enforced by an adequate system of 
local supervision, would undoubtedly 
put an end to the disease within 
comparatively few years. Those in- 
terested in this subject should ad- 
dress a letter or postal card to the 
Surgeon-General of the United 
States, Washington, D. C, requesting 
detailed information.* 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 581 



FOREIGN DISEASES 

A small class of communicable dis- 
eases sometimes occur in tlie United 
States as the result of infection from 
foreign parts. Notable among these 
are Asiatic cholera, bubonic plague 
and leprosy. 

Asiatic Cholera. — This disease is 
native to India. Thence it has 
spread in epidemic form from time 
to time throughout the civilized 
world. It is caused by a specific 
micro-organism sometimes called the 
" comma " bacillus on account of its 
shape. The presence of this is often 
the only test by which this disease 
can be distinguished from gastro- 
enteritis, ptomaine poisoning and 
other similar diseases. Asiatic chol- 
era closely resembles typhoid fever 
as regards modes of infection, and 
should be treated in an entirely simi- 
lar manner. Like typhoid it may be 
spread by healthy carriers and com- 
municated by the mild or " walking " 
cases of the disease. There is an 
anti-cholera vaccine similar to the 
anti-typhoid vaccine, by means of 
which the death rate has been greatly 
lowered. This disease is entirely 
preventable if the precautions recom- 
mended under tyj>hoid fever are ob- 
served. Needless to say a physician 
should always be summoned even in 
the mildest cases. 

The period of incubation is from 
one to five days, although it may be 
greatly prolonged. The symptoms 
are similar to ptomaine poisoning: 
vomiting, diarrhoea, sub-normal tem- 
perature, loss of pulse, suppression 
of urine and collapse. They are 
common to the action of various poi- 
sons and can only be distinguished by 
a competent physician. 

Bubonic Plague (Black Death). — 
This historic disease which destroyed 
upwards of 50 per cent of the 
population of England in the four- 
teenth century has, from time to 
time, ravaged nearly every part of 
the civilized world. It is caused by 
a vegetable micro-organism, the Ba- 
cillus pestis. Rats and other small 
rodents are very susceptible to this 
disease and it is communicated by 
them to man through the medium of 



fleas. There are three types of 
plague: (a) bubonic, characterized 
by glandular swelling. This is the 
form transmitted from rats to man 
by means of fleas; (b) pneumonic 
which is very much like pneumonia 
and which may be transmitted by 
contact infection in the same manner 
as typhoid fever; (c) septicemic, in 
which the patient is literally satur- 
ated with plague bacilli. This is 
transmitted by contact infection. 
The mortality ranges from 15 per 
cent up to as high as 50 per cent 
or 75 per cent. Death in the sep- 
ticemic type is a matter of hours; in 
the pneumonic type, of days; and in 
the bubonic type, of one or two weeks. 
In rats the disease may become 
chronic. It is most prevalent among 
rats when they are shut up in their 
holes in winter, but is most often 
communicated to human beings dur- 
ing summer. Then the rats are 
abroad and the fleas which have bitten 
the infected rodents are widely scat- 
tered through the community. The 
disease, however, may be communi- 
cated at any season of the year. The 
only remedy is the destruction of rats 
by means elsewhere recommended. 

Leprosy. — Leprosy is a communi- 
cable disease of the skin occurring 
very rarely in the United States, 
fewer than three hundred cases hav- 
ing been reported. The chief inter- 
est in this malady is due to its sup- 
posed frequency in Biblical times. 
An almost insane fear of leprosy has 
been caused by a general knowledge 
of what is said about it in the Bible, 
but its virulence, at least in modern 
times, is believed to be greatly exag- 
gerated. There are said to be fifty 
or more lepers engaged in various oc- 
cupations in the city of London. 
These are not regarded as dangerous 
to the public health. 

CONTAGIOUS DISEASES OF ANI- 
MALS 

There is a small group of conta- 
gious diseases of animals which are 
occasionally contril)uted to man. 
These include, notably, anthrax, glan- 
ders and rabies. Anthrax and glan- 
ders may be communicated by contact 



682 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



infection, but rabies occurs only from 
the bite of dogs or other infected 
animals. A veterinary physician 
should be promptly sent for in all 
cases of anthrax, glanders or farcy 
and his recommendations faithfully 
observed. Carcasses of animals dead 
of these diseases should be immedi- 
ately buried in a grave not less than 
six feet deep. Eight or ten inches 
of unslaked lime should be placed in 
the bottom of the grave and a similar 
amount spread over the carcass be- 
fore the earth is filled in. The site 
for burial should be distant from any 
stream or other source of water sup- 
ply and a strong fence should be 
erected to enclose it. Stables and all 
objects with which the dead animal 
has come in contact should be thor- 
oughly disinfected. The germs of 
these diseases and their sports often 
retain their vitality for many years. 
Hence too much care cannot be given 
to the process of disinfection. 

Rabies (Hydrophobia). — This is a 
specific communicable disease which 
affects chiefly the canine race, al- 
though all warm-blooded animals, in- 
cluding man, are susceptible to it. 
There is a widely prevalent belief 
that if persons or animals are bitten 
by a dog they are liable to become 
rabid if the dog should contract the 
disease at any future time. It will 
be a great comfort to many persons 
who have been bitten by animals to 
know that there is no foundation for 
this impression. Rabies is transmit- 
ted only by animals that are actually 
diseased at the time the bite is in- 
flicted. Every animal or person bit- 
ten does not necessarily develop the 
disease. This de])ends on the location 
and size of the wound, the flow of 
blood produced and other conditions. 
The nearer the bite is located to the 
central nervous system and the deep- 
er it is, the greater danger of a fatal 
result. Rabies is believed to be 
caused by a specific germ but this 
has not yet been identified. 

Symptoms. — There are two types 
of rabies: (1) the furious, violent 
or irritable; (2) the dumb or para- 
lytic. Cases of furious rabies in a 
dog usually develop between three 
weeks and three months after the 



animal has been infected. A marked 
change in the disposition of the ani- 
mal should arouse suspicion. An af- 
fectionate dog may become morose 
and depressed. A snappy, treacher- 
ous dog may become mild or affec- 
tionate. Then comes an irresistible 
tendency to roam. A dog will fight 
or bite at any restraint which inter- 
feres with its freedom. He may roam 
about for several days, aimlessly, in 
a nervous and irritable condition. 
He tends to eat or chew indigestible 
objects such as rags, leather, straw, 
feathers, sticks and the like. He be- 
comes unable to swallow and his sa- 
liva becomes frothy from constant 
champing of the jaws. But foaming 
at the mouth is not a reliable symp- 
tom, nor is fear of water, since rabid 
dogs sometimes swim streams. When 
tired of roving a dog tends to return 
home and hide in some secluded 
place. 

Paralysis of the throat sets in 
early. This changes the normal bark 
of the affected dog to a long, reso- 
nant, peculiarly drawn-out cry, like 
the yelp of a coyote. Later the pa- 
ralysis extends to the muscles of the 
jaw. This causes the lower jaw to 
drop and the tongue to hang out, 
collect dirt and appear dry and black 
in color. The pupil of the eye di- 
lates, the paralysis extends to the 
hind legs and the dumb form of the 
disease results. Death follows in 
from four to eight days after de- 
velopment of the first symptoms. 

The dumb or paralytic form of 
rabies in the dog is much more infre- 
quent. The dog is depressed and 
seeks quiet spots in which to hide. 
The first symptom observable is 
often paralysis of the lower jaw, 
suggesting that the animal may have 
a bone in its throat. Paralysis quick- 
ly progresses and death results in 
from one to three days. 

Rabies in Cattle.— The symptoms 
are similar to those of the dog. 
There is loss of appetite, stopjiage of 
the secretion of milk, great restless- 
ness, anxiety, manifestation of fear 
and change in the disposition of the 
animal. Then conies excitation or 
madness, loud bellowing, violent but- 
ting, with an insane desire to attack 



PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE 583 



other animals and sometimes the de- 
sire to bite. The paralysis progresses 
rapidly with loss of flesh and finally 
the animal lies in a comatose condi- 
tion and dies, usually in from four 
to six days. The temperature re- 
mains normal or even sub-normal. 

Rabies in Cats. — The animal hides 
in a dark corner and dies unobserved 
in the course of a day or two, or 
becomes violent and suddenly attacks 
animals or persons, especially chil- 
dren. The cat loses its voice or mews 
hoarsely. It becomes emaciated and 
succumbs within a few daj^s. 

Other animals as horses, sheep, 
goats, hogs, chickens and wild ani- 
mals exhibit much the same symp- 
toms. 

Rabies appear to be spreading, but 
can be readily controlled by proper 
local regulations for licensing and 
muzzling dogs, since the disease is al- 
most always spread to other animals 
by dogs. As many as sixteen persons 
have been bitten by a single small 
dog, which also wounded a great 
many other animals. 

Treatment for Rabies. — Any 
wound made by a dog or other ani- 
mal showing symptoms of rabies 
should be promptly cauterized. Go 
to a doctor or drug store, if there is 
one at hand. Otherwise cauterize the 
wound with nitric acid, carbolic acid 
or if necessary red-hot iron. Or 
tincture of iodine may be used, if 
nothing better is at hand. The best 
agent is nitric acid. Carry this on a 
swab or glass rod to every recess and 
part of the wound. Carbolic acid 
and other acids are less efficient; ni- 
trate of silver is useless. A red-hot 
iron is not as eflfective as a suitable 
acid, is very painful and makes a 
wound more severe than is necessary. 
Great care must be observed when 
using strong acids or red-hot iron 
about the face. Children or very 



nervous subjects should preferably 
be put under an anaesthetic before 
the cautery is used. 

Capture the suspected animal alive, 
if possible, by means of a lasso or 
net, or by turning a box or barrel 
over it. Or snare it by means of a 
loop of stout cord on the end of a 
pole. Put the animal into a stout 
box or pen but take care not to in- 
jure or mistreat it, or deprive it of 
food and water. If it remains alive 
and well for ten days there is no 
danger of rabies. But if it dies or 
the symptoms become unmistakable, 
send the head to the neai'est labora- 
tory for examination. 

In killing an animal suspected of 
rabies avoid shooting through the 
head or beating on the head. This 
may interfere with a proper exami- 
nation. Shoot the animal through the 
back or behind the shoulders. Cut 
ofi" the head close to the shoulders, 
wrap it in a cloth wrung out of a 
standard solution of bichloride of 
mercury (1:500), place it in a new tin 
pail with a tight-fitting cover and 
pack the pail in a larger bucket or 
box surrounded by ice. Ship by ex- 
press to the laboratory and notify 
the director by telegram of the ship- 
ment. 

Should the investigation show the 
existence of rabies, the only method 
of treatment which ofi"ers any protec- 
tion is immunization by the Pasteur 
vaccine. This requires about three 
weeks and usually demands attend- 
ance at a hospital or sanitarium, but 
may be given by any competent 
physician. The Pasteur treatment, if 
given in time, is almost always suc- 
cessful. The proportion of failures 
is less than 1 per cent, whereas from 
10 per cent to 15 per cent of un- 
treated persons who have been bitten 
by rabid animals develop the disease.

SAVE THE BABIES 

A normal, well born baby is hard 
to kill. Nature intends tbat every 
such baby shall be well and strong, 
and grow to maturity. Yet the cen- 
sus shows that of the two and one- 
half million babies born every year 
in the United States, one-half die be- 
fore they reach their twenty-third 
year. One-fourth never reach their 
fifth birthday; one-eighth, or nearly 
one-third of a million, die within the 
first year of life. One-third of all 
deaths occur under the fifth year of 
age; one-fifth, during the first year 
of life. The chance of living a week 
is less for a new born child than for 
a man of ninety. The chance of liv- 
ing a year is less than for a man of 
four score. 

Since the rise of the germ theory 
of disease, wonderful discoveries have 
been made by the high power micro- 
scope as to the effects of germ life 
upon human health. It has now been 
proved that a large part of the mor- 
tality among infants is due to pre- 
ventable causes. IMuch of this death 
rate is due to dirt. By this is not 
necessarily meant uncleanllness in the 
ordinary sense of dirt which can be 
seen, but a lack of sanitary precau- 
tions in the scientific sense, result- 
ing in dirt invisible to the naked eye 
but which under the microscope is 



584 



seen to contain millions of injurious 
bacteria. The best proof of the vi- 
tality of infants is that so many do 
live and grow up in spite of the un- 
sanitary conditions with which they 
are surrounded, and the poisonous 
milk and other substances they are 
compelled to swallow. 

Now that science has shown that 
so many deaths among infants are 
preventable, a nation-wide campaign 
to save the babies has been set on 
foot. A special effort has been made 
to discover the sanitary and other 
rules that must be followed by moth- 
ers to keep their babies well, and 
cause them to thrive and grow 
strong. The following is a collection 
of these rules as laid down by the 
public health authorities throughout 
the United States. It contains the 
latest and most authentic scientific 
information obtainable. 

What Kills Babies? — Out of every 
hundred deaths under two years of 
age, thirty-five are the result of im- 
proper food and feeding. About 
ninety-five per cent of these are 
avoidable. Twenty-six are due to ac- 
cidents and defects at birth. About 
one-half are avoidable. Eighteen 
are caused by impure air diseases 
(pneumonia and bronchitis) ; seven- 
ty-five per cent avoidable. Two 
are caused by tuberculosis and six by 
acute contagious diseases. All of 



PREVENTABLE DISEASES OF CHILDREN 585 



these are avoidable. The remainder 
are due to miscellaneous causes, 
many of which could be and ought to 
be avoided. 

The two principal factors which 
multiply the deaths of infants are 
the denial of its birthright — its moth- 
er's breasts — and the heat of sum- 
mer. In other words, the bottle feed- 
ing of infants in warm weather is 
what causes the death rate to run ex- 
tremely high. Ten times as many 
bottle fed babies succumb to diar- 
rhoeal diseases as breast-fed babies. 
When the mother from necessity or 
convenience takes away the natural 
food of the child — her own breasts 
— she takes from it nine-tenths of 
its chance of life. Hot weather in 
itself has little to do with the death 
rate of infants from diarrhoea, as 
breast-fed children do not show 
much, if any, increase of death rate 
during the summer months. The 
two factors that bring about the high 
death rate, namely, bottle feeding 
and the hot season, combine to pro- 
duce a single condition, namely, milk 
containing a dangerous quantity of 
injurious bacteria or germs. When 
the child takes nourishment from its 
mother's breast it gets a practically 
sterile or germ-free food. When it 
is fed modified cow's milk or other 
artificial food from a bottle, espe- 
cially in hot weather, it may be, and 
often is, swallowing a quick or slow 
poison. This, however, is wholly 
preventable if proper sanitary pre- 
cautions to insure strict scientific 
cleanliness are observed. 

HEALTH AND DISEASE 

Fontanelles. — In the middle line 
from before backwards on the top 
of a baby's head in the early weeks 
of his life, are two openings or soft 
places not yet covered with bony 
formation. The one in front is called 
the " anterior fontanelle." This closes 
in five or six weeks. But the larger 
one, just back of the forehead, is 
usually not closed until the child is a 
year and a half old or a little older. 
If widely open as the time for clo- 
sure approaches, or if the closure is 
much delayed, it may indicate rickets 



or other serious diseased condition. 
In such cases the advice of the fam- 
ily physician should be had. 

Respiration. — Trustworthy infor- 
mation about respiration, pulse and 
temperature are a great help in judg- 
ing when to send for the doctor. The 
normal standards are given below. 
But remember that the action of a 
baby's lungs and heart is quickly 
accelerated by exercise or by excite- 
ment. And respiration, pulse and 
temperature are often much affected 
by causes which are comparatively 
trivial. Both the pulse-rate and res- 
piration are more regular and slower 
in sleep than while awake. There is 
a progressive decrease in the rapid- 
ity of the pulse and respiration from 
infancy to adult life. 

Approximately, the number of res- 
pirations per minute at different 
ages are : 



At birth. 


35 or more 


" 1 year. 


27 


" 2 years. 


25 


" 6 " 


22 


" 1-2 " 


20 



In adult life, 15 to 17 

In serious illness, as, for instance, 
in pneumonia, young children may 
breathe as rapidly as 62 to 80 times 
in the minute. 

Pulse. — The rate of the pulse in 
health at difPerent ages is: 

In the first month, 120 to 140 



At 1 j'car, 


110 to 130 


" 2 years, 


100 to 110 


« 6 " 


90 to 95 


" 12 " 


80 to 88 


In adult life, 


72 or lower. 



These are the rates while at rest. 
During infancy a rise of twenty, 
thirty or more beats per minute is 
not uncommon as the result of slight 
effort or disturbance. In the serious 
acute diseases, as in scarlet fever or 
pneumonia, the pulse may run to 160, 
180, or higher. 

Temperature. — A training in moth- 
erhood should include the use of the 
clinical thermometer so that correct 
observations on the temperature and 
its variations may reveal indications 
of the approach of serious conditions.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Buy a good clinical thermometer at 
your drug store. Or ask your physi- 
cian to get one for you and explain to 
you how to use it. 

The normal temperature of the hu- 
man body is about Qaj" F. In early 
infancy, it is slightly higher than 
from later childhood on. The tem- 
perature of 100° indicates the pres- 
ence of fever; 102° to 103° consti- 
tutes moderate fever; lO^" to 105° 
shows a high fever; above 105° means 
a very high and very dangerous fever. 

DISEASE OF THE EYES 

Ophthalmia Neonatorum (Infan- 
tile Blindness). — About 15 per cent 
of all cases of total blindness are 
caused by inflammation of the eyes in 
new-born babies. This disease is al- 
ways due to an infection entering the 
eyes of the baby at the time of, or 
shortly after birth. It may be almost 
always prevented by proper care and 
by early and correct treatment. If 
precautions are not taken, and the 
disease develops and runs its course 
uncheclved, the sight is totally de- 
stroyed, often within a fortnight. 

For All Mothers. — All women dur- 
ing pregnancy should thoroughly per- 
form daily external cleansing with 
soap and water and a clean wash 
cloth. Should the pregnant woman 
have any irritating discharges, or 
even profuse white discharge, she 
should be instructed to inunediately 
consult her physician or the nearest 
dispensary. 

For All Children. — Immediately 
after the delivery of the head, and 
before the delivery of the body, the 
eyelids should be carefully cleaned 
by means of absorbent cotton or a 
.soft linen cloth, dipped into warm 
water that has been boiled or boric 
acid (saturated) solution. A sepa- 
rate cloth .should be used for each 
eye, and the lids washed, from the 
nose outward, free from all mucus, 
blood or discharges. All wipes 
should be burned after using. No 
opening of the lids should be at- 
tempted. At this time also the lips 
and nose should be wi])ed free of 
mucus in like manner, and the little 
finger, wrapped with a piece of moist 



linen, should be passed into the child's 
mouth and any accumulated mucus re- 
moved by an outward sweep of the 
finger. As soon after birth as pos- 
sible, the eyelids should be again wiped 
clean of mucus, and two drops of a 
one per cent solution of nitrate of 
silver should be dropped into each 
eye. One application only of the sil- 
ver solution should be made. Ordi- 
narily no further attention should 
be given the eyes for several 
hours. 

The silver nitrate solution is best 
kept in a dark-colored bottle with a 
ground glass stopper. The neck of 
the bottle should measure about half 
an inch in diameter. The glass rod 
used is six inches long, very smooth 
and round at each end. The silver 
solution will keep for many months, 
but it is best to renew it about once 
in six weeks. 

Each time that the child is bathed, 
the eyes should be first wiped clean, 
as above described, with tlie boric 
acid solution. The hands of the per- 
son charged with the care of the 
child must be washed with soap and 
dried with a clean towel before the 
eyes of the child are touched. Every- 
thing that is brought near the eyes 
must be, in every instance, absolutely 
clean. 

The cotton that is used on the eyes 
of the child must, in every instance, 
be immediately burned after using. 
The water, towels, old linen and the 
cotton that have been used on the 
mother must, under no circum- 
stances, be applied to the child. The 
air of the bedroom must be kept 
as pure as possible, and the linen 
should never be dried in the sick 
room. 

Inflammation of the Eyes. — Should 
the lids become red and swollen, or 
gummed along their borders, or 
should a mattery discharge be mixed 
with the tears as the child sleeps or 
cries, call an oculist or a physician 
immediately, or take the child to the 
nearest dispensary. Each hour of 
delay adds to the danger. While 
waiting, bathe the child's eyes every 
half hour with pledgets of cotton 
dipped in a warm solution of boric 
acid. Open the lids wide and allow 



PREVENTABLE DISEASES OF CHILDREN 587 



the warm solution to flood the ej^es 
and wash out any matter which may 
have gathered there. 

All of those in the home should be 
warned of the danger of catching the 
disease by getting the matter into 
their own eyes. Do not fondle the 
child. Take care tliat nothing which 
has been used about its eyes or face 
shall be used for any other purpose. 
Do not listen to those who say it will 
amount to nothing, or to those who 
say to bathe the eyes of the child 
with the mother's milk. Such advice 
is bad. The milk is a means of 
spreading the germs of this disease. 
The slightest delay may result in 
blindness. 

Trachoma. — This is an infectious 
disease of the eyelids which often 
results in total blindness. It occurs 
chiefly among children who are 
brought up under unsanitary condi- 
tions. Contributory causes are lack 
of cleanliness and lack of proper 
nourishment. It may be communi- 
cated from one person to another by 
the use of a common towel, by inter- 
changing or lending handkerchiefs, or 
by the contact of infected hands 
among children at play. This disease 
is most prevalent among school chil- 
dren and in institutions, work-shops, 
army camps and other places where 
large numbers of persons are herded 
together and toilet or other facilities 
are used in common. 

Any symptoms of redness, or in- 
flammation of the eyes, or granula- 
tion of the eyelids should be brought 
to the attention of a physician, espe- 
cially if accompanied bj^ pain, sensi- 
tiveness to light, swelling or dis- 
charge. About 15 per cent of all 
cases of preventable blindness arc due 
to this disease. Diligent eflfort should 
be made to prevent it from spreading. 
When a case occurs, all possibility of 
the infection of other persons should 
be eliminated. The patient should 
have separate towels, wash basins and 
the like set apart for individual use. 
Children with this disease should be 
excluded from the public schools 
until the acute stage is over. Under 
proper treatment, if taken in its early 
stages, blindness can ordinarily be 
prevented. 



INTESTINAL DISEASES 

Summer Complaint (Cholera In- 
fantum). — This fatal disease which 
kills thousands of infants every year 
attends continued high temperature. 
Excessive heat if long endured pro- 
foundly affects the nerves and fret- 
fulness (nervousness) always pre- 
cedes attacks of cholera infantum. 
The digestion is depressed by ner- 
vousness. Then if the child happens 
to over-eat, or to be fed unwhole- 
some food, it quickly develops this 
dreaded disease. The micro-organ- 
isms (germs) which cause this and 
other intestinal diseases of infancy 
are most numerous and active in hot 
weather. Thus they are always at 
hand to attack infants when their 
powers of resistance have become les- 
sened by a long continued heated 
term. 

Cholera Morbus (summer diar- 
rhoea and dysentery) also occurs 
principally during the summer and 
autumn. This is caused by improper 
food and sudden chilling of the body 
after exposure to great heat. Cer- 
tain substances will produce it in cer- 
tain persons, as, for instance, veal or 
shell fish. And all dishes cooked with 
milk such as rice pudding, cream 
puffs and even ice cream, are dan- 
gerous when they have been kept too 
long. Take care that the baby does 
not get any remnants of stale food. 
Under-ripe and over-ripe fruit — 
especially if taken with large draughts 
of ice water — will cause this dis- 
ease. But sound ripe fruit is a 
natural food in hot weather for chil- 
dren over two years of age, and 
wholesome. Avoid chills during 
sleep. In temperate and changeable 
climates have a light blanket always 
at hand to draw over an infant, if 
the weather suddenly becomes cold 
during the night. Persistent summer 
diarrhoea is sometimes caused by ma- 
laria or impure water. Any condi- 
tions liable to contaminate air and 
water should be carefully sought out 
and remedied. Water of doubtful 
purity can and should be rendered 
safe by boiling. Mosquitoes and flies 
should be exterminated. As dysen- 
tery is often epidemic, it is wise to 



688 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



consider every case as a possible 
source of danger to others and to dis- 
infect all diarrhceal discharges with 
the greatest care. 

Symptoms of Intestinal Diseases. — 
Vomiting of sour and partly di- 
gested food (not siin])le regurgita- 
tion or " raising " of milk from over- 
feeding in young infants) is often 
the first sign of approaching illness. 
Vomiting may indicate one of the 
serious diseases of childhood or, more 
commonly in hot weather, " summer 
con)plaint " or simple diarrhoea. 
Diarrhoea does not come from teething 
but from too much food, too fre- 
quent feeding, too little water, too 
little sleep and too much handling. 
The most frequent cause is over- 
feeding. This often causes pro- 
longed sickness and finally death. 
Vomiting clue to this cause may be 
the first sign of trouble. The bowels 
may not become loose until several 
days later. A certain symptom of 
danger is loose, green passages from 
the bowels, or passages containing 
mucus or curds. A healthy bottle- 
fed infant should have at least one 
and not more than two or three 
movements of the bowels each day. 
These should be yellow or " ginger- 
bread color " and not too hard to be 
passed easily. If they become green- 
ish, frothy, or otherwise unnatural, 
and more frequent than two or three 
a day, consult your doctor. In sum- 
mer it is dangerous to wait. Any 
diarrhoea or simple looseness of the 
bowels indicates the presence of some 
irritation in the intestinal tract. 

These diseases are often mild at 
the beginning. There may be no 
fever and the child may show no 
signs of illness other than diarrhoea 
or vomiting. Such a baby — often in 
a few hours — may become danger- 
ously, if not fatally, ill. The sim- 
plest cases of diarrhoea and vomiting 
during the summer must not be ig- 
nored. Neglect of the first symp- 
toms of indigestion may lead to in- 
fection and inflammation and be fol- 
lowed by the death of the child. If 
taken in hand promptly, this condi- 
tion will almost always yield to sim- 
ple remedies and serious trouble may 
be averted. If the movements remain 



green in color and increase in num- 
ber to five or six or more in twenty- 
four hours, the baby is beginning to 
have bowel trouble or summer diar- 
rhoea. 

Causes and Remedies. — When the 
baby vomits or has diarrhoea the first 
thing to do is to find and remove the 
cause. The trouble is probably due 
to improper feeding or over-feeding. 
The child may be given too much 
food, the milk may be too strong for 
its age, or it may be dirty and un- 
sanitary. A child gets diarrhoea 
more often in summer than in win- 
ter because the heat makes him weak 
and spoils his food, and because you 
fail to realize that he needs less food 
in hot weather. Stop all food at 
once. Every drop of milk that goes 
into the baby's mouth after this 
warning simply adds to the poison 
that is already there. You will cause 
serious or fatal illness by feeding 
your baby after the bowels become 
loose and the movements green in 
color. Give nothing but pure boiled 
water or barley water. Send for the 
doctor and do not begin feeding the 
baby again without the doctor's or- 
ders. Meantime stop the milk at 
once. Give only cool boiled water or 
barley water until the child can be 
seen by a physician. 

Do not give any medicine, except 
perhaps a teaspoonful of lime water 
every hour, to modify the acidity of 
the stomach. If the baby should 
have a convulsion before the doctor 
comes, put it in a warm bath and 
pour cool water on its head. But 
this must not be done if the convul- 
sion occurs immediately after a meal. 
Do not give any " cordials " or " teas " 
or diarrhoea mixtures to stop vomit- 
ing or check the bowels. Nothing but 
harm can be done by such means. 

If you cannot get a doctor prompt- 
ly, give the baby two teaspoon fuls of _ 
castor oil to remove the irritating ■ 
matter from the bowels. Also wash 
out the bowels with an enema of 
te]nd water containing two level tea- 
spoonfuls of salt to the quart. This 
should be given from a fountain 
syringe. Do not hold the bag more 
than eighteen inches or two feet 
above the baby, so that the water 



PREVENTABLE DISEASES OF CHILDREN 



589 



will run slowly. Babies under fifteen 
months almost invariably pass part 
of the water back by the side of the 
tube while it is flowing in. 

When vomiting occurs give the 
baby as much water as it will take. 
This will help to wash the remaining 
undigested food out of the stomach. 
After this for eight or ten hours 
give only one or two teaspoonfuls of 
boiled water every ten or fifteen min- 
utes, if wanted. A larger amount 
will be vomited. Give no food for at 
least six hours after the vomiting 
has stopped, then give barley water 
or rice water in gradually increas- 
ing quantities, or give broth or white 
of egg. Later, when the child is en- 
tirely well, it may be gradually 
worked back to its regular food. A 
weak mustard plaster on the pit of 
the stomach, left until there is a rosy 
color, then promptly removed, will as- 
sist in counteracting vomiting. 

OTHER DISEASES OF INFANCY 

Fever. — If the child becomes weak 
in hot weather, is fretful and espe- 
cially if it has fever and the skin is 
hot and dry, take off all its clothes 
except the diaper and put on a night 
dress. Sponge it all over with cool 
water at frequent intervals and do 
not wipe it quite dry. Let the water 
evaporate and thus carry off some of 
the fever. Give it all the cool water 
it will drink. No matter how high 
the fever a baby with bowel trou- 
ble always does better out of doors ' 
in pleasant weather than in a hot, 
stuffy room. A child with fever will 
not take cold if you keep it out of 
strong, cold drafts. 

Great care must be exercised in 
treating for fever. There are two 
principal kinds. In outer or sur- 
face fever, the hands and feet are 
warm and the skin hot. Place cold 
applications to the head, hot water 
bottle to the feet and bathe in cold 
water. In case of inward fever 
the hands and feet are cold and the 
skin cool and pale and mottled. 
Place cold applications at the head, a 
hot water bottle to the feet and bathe 
in hot mustard water to bring the 
blood to the surface. A sense of 



touch is unreliable as to fever. Every 
mother should have a clinical ther- 
mometer and ask her physician to in- 
struct her in its use. 

Eruptions. — If the baby has any 
eruption or breaking out of the skin, 
consult the doctor promjjtly. Every 
rash is not prickly heat. It may be 
some serious disease like scarlet 
fever, smallpox or chickenpox and 
may require the promptest possible 
treatment. 

Teething. — A few words as to 
baby's teething. The first teeth — 
the two lower front ones — are usually 
cut when the baby is from six to 
seven months old. Some babies cut 
their teeth with little trouble; others 
are restless, uneasy and wakeful. 
The latter is especially the case if 
the baby is constipated. 

The teeth are usually cut in pairs: 
First the two lower (in the center), 
next the two upj^er, then the outside 
two above, then two below, next to 
those first cut. These teeth usually 
are all present by the twelfth month. 
The cutting, however, does not al- 
ways follow the above order, and all 
children do not cut their first teeth 
by the sixth or seventh month. 

Symptoms of difficult teething are 
fever, restlessness, sleeplessness and, 
rocally, swollen or tender gums. 
There is often loss of appetite and 
thirst caused by fever. These symp- 
toms are present only in severe cases. 
When a child's teeth begin to come, 
it should be given less food and 
more water. It will often take more 
food than it can digest because it is 
thirsty and the food is liquid. The 
result is diarrhoeal trouble due to in- 
testinal irritation from over-feeding. 
This is often mistakenly supposed to 
be due to teething, whereas if babies 
are properly fed and hygienic rules 
observed, verj' few will have any 
bowel trouble during the first or sec- 
ond year regardless of whether teeth 
are coming or not. 

For the sleeplessness and irritabil- 
ity which so often accompany teeth- 
ing, much can be done by the mother. 
Drugs should not be given, except un- 
der the direction of a physician. A 
hot foot bath will often have a sooth- 
ing effect by relieving the congestion 



590 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



in the head and mouth. Mustard can 
often be added to the foot bath with 
benefit. A little castor oil will be 
beneficial, for a good movement of 
the bowels will relieve congestion in 
the gums. The mother's finger dipped 
in sirup of lettuce can be gently car- 
ried over the tender and inflamed gum, 
and now and then by a little firmer 
jircssure may allow the point of the 
tooth to free its way through. The 
baby may be allowed to bite on a 
small chicken or ham bone, or if 
over nine months, on a piece of rare 
roast beef. 

Beware of soothing sirups which 
merely " dope " the baby, and often 
cause great harm. 

Constipation. — If a bottle-fed baby 
is constipated, wash out the bowels 
witli an enema of tepid water con- 
taining salt in the proportion of a 
level teaspoonful to the pint. Give 
one or two teaspoonsfuls of castor oil. 
If this does not afford relief within 
four hours consult your physician. 
At this time you will be able to pre- 
vent a serious summer complaint with 
which the baby is threatened. 

When the food does not agree 
with the baby it will fall to gain 
weight or will be constipated, have 
colic, " rolling of gases in the stom- 
ach " (flatulence), loose stools and 
diarrhoea. Consult your doctor with- 
out delay. Remember the stitch in 
time. The fact that an infant under 
one year of age does not gain in 
weight may show that it needs a dif- 
ferent kind of liquid food, but does 
not indicate that it requires any sort 
of solid food and under no circum- 
stances should solid food be given to 
babies under twelve or thirteen 
months of age. In hot weather reduce 
the amount of food and give more 
water. Pour out about one-fourth 
of the milk, replace with water and 
make the feedings farther apart, giv- 
ing water between. These simple 
rules are intended to help you take 
care of the baby when it is well and 
to prevent its becoming sick. But 
the first thing to do wlien the baby is 
sick is to send for J'our physician. 
The home remedies above given will 
help you to check the trouble and 
keep it under control until the doctor 



comes and prescribes the proper 
course of treatment. 



DON'T DRUG YOUR BABY 

Soothing Sirups. — There is no such 
thing as a harmless soothing sirup, 
teething powder or " baby's friend," 
as such drugs are ironically called by 
unjjrincipled manufacturers. This is 
a fact which all right-thinking moth- _ 
ers should take to heart and seek to V 
impress upon others who are respon- " 
sible for the care of infants. Hun- 
dreds of thousands of children have 
been poisoned to death in infancy by 
such compounds. Other children have 
survived their use with weakened con- 
stitutions, or have become the victims 
of drug habits in later life from the 
effects of these mixtures. The chief 
active agents in most of these com- 
pounds are opium, morphine, heroin, 
codcin, chloroform and chloral hydrate 
— all active poisons and especially 
deadly to children. 

Since the passage of the Pure 
Food Law, the manufacturers of 
preparations containing habit-form- 
ing drugs, or drugs dangerous to life, 
have been compelled to print on the 
label a list of these substances. 
Hence mothers should read carefully 
the labels of any cough mixtures, 
soothing sii'ups or other preparations 
recommended for children and dis- 
card them if they are found to con- 
tain any of these ingredients. You 
may safely regard with grave suspi- 
cion the manufacturer, dealer or 
physician who tells you that these 
substances are not likely to occur, in 
the widely advertised preparations, in 
quantities dangerous to your baby's 
health or life. 

Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Sirup is 
a well known preparation with which 
thousands of helpless infants have 
been drugged into insensibility bj' 
ignorant or indifferent mothers and 
nurses for more than a generation. 
It contains opium in the form of 
morphine sulphate. There is little 
doubt but that this nostrum has 
caused the death of many children 
and has done incalculable injury to 
otliers. Collier's Wcckl;/ — to which 
much credit is due for its exposure 



PREVENTABLE DISEASES OF CHILDREN 591 



of the nostrums which are such a 
menace to the lives and health of the 
American people — tells the following 
story: "A prominent New York 
lawyer was asked by his office scrub- 
woman to buy a ticket to some asso- 
ciation ball. He replied: 'How can 
you go to these affairs, Nora, when 
you have two young children at 
home?' 'Sure, they're all right,' she 
returned blithely. ' Just wan tay- 
spoonful of Winslow's and they lay 
like the dead till marnin'.' " 

The great demand for soothing 
sirup by mothers who wish their ba- 
bies to " stay put " has produced a 
rival to the late Mrs. Winslow under 
the touching name of " Kopp's Baby's 
Friend." This also contains opium. 
Collier's states that it is made of 
sweetened water and morphine sul- 
phate. It is well styled " the king of 
baby soothers," since it is said to 
contain in each teaspoonful enough 
morphine to kill an infant. Morphine 
should be given to a child under ten 
years of age only in very rare in- 
stances and never except under the 
direction of a physician. Read care- 
fully the following list of such prep- 
arations and what they contain. This 
was compiled by the Bureau of 
Chemistry of the United States De- 
partment of Agriculture: 

Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Sirup, 
morphine sulphate. 

Children's Comfort, morphine sul- 
phate. 

Dr. Fahrney's Pepsin Anodyne 
Compound, morphine sulphate. 

Dr. Fahrney's Teething Sirup, 
morphine and chloroform. 

Dr. Fowler's Strawberry and Pep- 
permint Mixture, morphine. 

Dr. Grove's Anodyne for Infants, 
morphine sulphate. 

Hooper's Anodyne, the Infants' 
Friend, morphine hydrochloride. 

Jadway's Elixir for Infants, 
codein.* 

Dr. James' Soothing Sirup Cor- 
dial, heroin.* 

Kopp's Baby's Friend, morphine 
sulphate. 

Dr. Miller's Anodyne for Babies, 

* Heroin and Codein are derivatives of 
opium, the same as morphine, and their 
action is similar. 



morphine sulphate and chloral hy- 
drate. 

Dr. Moffett's Teethina, Teething 
Powders, powdered opium. 

Victor Infant Relief, chloroform 
and cannabis indica 

To aUay the fears of mothers, manu- 
facturers and dealers often print on 
the label of such preparations state- 
ments of the following character: 
"Contains nothing injurious to the 
youngest babe"; or "Mothers need 
not fear giving this medicine, as no 
bad effects will come from its con- 
tinued use." All such statements as- 
sociated with the presence of opium 
or any of its derivatives — niorjjhine, 
codein, heroin — chloroform, cannabis 
indica (hasheesh) or chloral hydrate, 
are deliberate falsehoods made with 
the calculated intention to deceive. 
There is always danger that an un- 
due proportion of these drugs may be 
present in a given bottle or that an 
over-dose may be given and the baby 
put to sleep never to awake again. 
Numerous such cases are on record. 
In other instances when the remedy 
is freely used, the child does not suc- 
cumb but develops a craving for the 
drug comparable to a drug habit in 
adolts. As soon as one dose of the 
drug passes away, the child becomes 
irritable and fretful with the result 
that another dose is administered. 
When the craving is thus met the child 
is quieted and the mother or nurse 
feels justified in " recommending" the 
remedy to her neighbors. Sometimes 
such children look plump and healthy 
when, as a matter of fact, their flesh is 
soft and flabby and they are poorly 
prepared to withstand the attack of 
disease. 

Don't Dope Colicky Babies. — Sooth- 
ing sirup is most often recommended 
and used in case of colic. Paregoric, 
whisky, brandy or soothing sirup are 
improper remedies for that disease. 
Colic is often a symptom of some 
condition which need^ attention. 
Drugging the baby into insensibility, 
or making it drunk, will not remove 
the cause of illness. Colic is often 
due to constipation, in which case an 
enema of warm water — with the addi- 
tion of salt at the rate of a level tea- 
spoonful to the pint — is required fol-

lowed by one or two teaspoonfuls of 
castor oil or other gentle laxative 
medicine. 

Or, colic may come from cold 
hands and feet. Keep a flannel belly 
band on a "colicky" baby both sum- 
mer and winter, but don't dope or 
drug the baby. When it is sick 
enough to need soothing sirup, it is 
sick enough to need a doctor. Proper 
feeding will usually overcome the 
trouble. In correcting errors in feed- 
ing a physician is your best ad- 
visor. 

SYMPTOMS OF COMMUNICABLE 
DISEASES 

Mothers, school teachers and other 
persons in immediate charge of small 
children should be constantly u])on 
the look-out for symptoms of com- 
municable diseases and other common 
conditions requiring medical atten- 
tion. In general, any marked de- 
parture from the normal is a danger 
signal. The most common symptoms 
of acute contagious diseases are as 
follows: very red or pale face; red 
or discharging eyes, ears or nose; un- 
usual dullness or sleepiness; evi- 
dences of sore throat; coughing, 
vomiting or diarrhoeal discharges. 
Eruptions of any sort demand espe- 
cially prompt attention. Chronic dis- 
eases may be suggested by emacia- 
tion; defective vision of one or both 
eyes; deafness; mouth constantly 
open; marked odors from the ear, 
nose, mouth or person; peculiar pos- 
tures when sitting or walking; fre- 
quent requests to go out or to the 
toilet; pain or swelling, or constant 
scratching of any part of the body. 

The following summary will be 
found convenient for ready refer- 
ence: 

Symptoms of Fever. — Headache, 
dullness or sleepiness and indisposi- 
tion for play or study; languid ex- 
pression of the eyes; sometimes 
flushed cheek and other times pallor; 
heat of skin and increased frequency 
of pulse, all indicate fever. Take the 
child's temperature promptly with a 
clinical thermometer. A normal tem- 
perature is between 98° and 99°. 

Eruptions. — The rash of scarlet 



fever is of a bright color. It usually 
appears on the neck and chest 
spreading thence to the face. A very 
characteristic symptom is a pale ring 
about the mouth. There is usually 
sore throat. 

The eruption of measles is a rose 
or purple red. It occurs in blotches 
about the size of a pea. It appears 
first on the face and is associated 
with running of the nose and eyes. 

The eruption of chickenpox ap- 
pears first as small red pimples 
which quickly become small red blis- 
ters. 

Colds and Sore Throat. — Symp- 
toms of a cold in the head with run- 
ning eyes, sneezing and discharges 
from the nose and sore throat may 
mean nothing more than coryza or 
tonsilitis. But very often they indi- 
cate diphtheria, scarlet fever or 
measles. A thin watery nasal dis- 
charge which irritates the nostrils 
and upper lip indicates diphtheria. 
Weak and running eyes indicate 
measles. 

Coughs. — A cough may mean a 
simple cold or slight bronchitis. But 
a spasmodic cough which occurs in 
paroxysms and is uncontrollable indi- 
cates whooping cough. A croupy 
cough — harsh and ringing — indicates 
diphtheria. A painful cough indi- 
cates diseases of the lungs, especially 
pleurisy or pneumonia. A long-con- 
tinued, hacking cough indicates tu- 
berculosis. 

Vomiting'. — This may mean only 
some digestive disturbance. But it 
may indicate the onset of diphtheria, 
smallpox or scarlet fever. 

Quarantine. — All children or other 
persons exposed to infection from the 
following diseases shoidd be kept 
under observation and excluded from 
schools and other public places dur- 
ing the following period of incubation 
dated from the latest exposure to such 
infection: Infantile paralysis (an- 
terior poliomyelitis), 14 days; diph- 
theria, 8 days; scarlet fever, 8 days; 
measles, chickenpox, whooping cough 
and mumps each 14 days. Patients 
convalescing from any of the above 
diseases should be isolated for the 
following periods reckoned from the 
date of onset or final diagnosis of the

disease, namely: Infantile paralysis 
(anterior poliomyelitis), 28 days; 
chickenpox, 15 days and thereafter un- 
til all scabs have fallen off; diphtheria, 
15 days and thereafter until two suc- 
cessive negative cultures have been ob- 
tained from the site of the disease 
secured at least twenty-four hours 
apart; measles, 21 days and thereafter 
until all catarrhal symptoms have 
ceased; mumps, 21 days and there- 
after until all glandular swelling has 
disappeared; scarlet fever, 42 days 
and thereafter until desquamation 
(peeling) is complete and all dis- 
charges from mucous membranes 
have stopped; whooping cough, 35 
days and thereafter until all spas- 
modic cough and whooping have 
ceased. 

Children afflicted with ringworms, 
scabies or impetigo contagiosa should 
be kept from school and contact with 
other persons until the disease is 
cured, or until a reliable physician 
can certify that they are not liable 
to spread infection. 

Diphtheria. — This disease often 
runs a very mild course. A child 
may hardly feel sick enough to take 
to its bed. Such cases may, and 
often do, give other children the form 
that kills. Hence every case of fever 
with sore throat in children should 
be looked on with suspicion. Look 
out especially tor nasal diphtheria 
marked by a thin watery discharge 
from the nose which irritates the 
nostrils and may cause bleeding from 
the nose and sores about the nostrils 
and upper lip. Any hoarseness or 
thickness of the voice should suggest 
an examination of the throat. If the 
tonsils, the palate and surroimding 
mucous membrane are inflamed and 
swollen, and particularly if there are 
white patches in any part of the 
throat, have a culture taken and 
tested for diphtheria. 

Scarlet Fever. — A sudden attack 
of vomiting, redness of the throat, 
headache and fever suggests scarlet 
fever. The rash appears on the first, 
or more often the second day and ex- 
tends from the back of the neck to 
the chest and thence all over the body. 
It is usually uniformly scattered but 
may be patch}'. The color is a char- 



acteristic deep red which may become 
more livid, approaching purjile. A 
very characteristic sign is a pale ring 
about the mouth. The eruption 
lasts from three to five days and 
fades. Peeling follows in the shape 
of scales and persists for several 
weeks. 

Measles. — The early symptoms are 
those of a feverish cold. Observe 
especially that the eyes are red and 
sensitive to the light. There is a 
discharge from the nose, sneezing and 
a dry hacking cough. Look for Kop- 
lik's sign, i. e., minute, pearly white 
blisters on the inside membrane of 
the mouth near the molar teeth. 
This is a sure sign. But oliserve that 
these may be few in number and not 
surrounded by any inflammation. 
Hence be sure to examine the patient 
carefully in a good light. The rash 
comes out the third or fourth day, 
first on the forehead and face arid 
then over the front and down the 
sides. As the red spots increase in 
number they form distinct crescent- 
shaped figures composed of papules 
just raised above the skin. In severe 
cases the color may deepen to pur- 
ple. The rash lasts four or five days, 
then fades and is followed by peeling. 
The disease is highly contagious from 
tlie beginning of the symptoms. 

Whooping Cough. — A persistent 
paroxysmal cough frequently accom- 
panied by vomiting is indicative of 
whooping cough, whether or not tliere 
is any distinct whoop. But as a rule, 
whooping cough comes in distinct 
spasms. During these the face is 
puft'ed and reddened, the eyes con- 
gested and watery, and the charac- 
teristic whooping sound is made. A 
paroxysm is often followed by vomit- 
ing. 

Mumps. — Any swelling of the 
glands behind the angle of the jaw 
should suggest mumps. The swell- 
ing extends just in front, just behind 
and below the ear and is extremely 
painful. A very frequent symjitom 
is swelling inside the mouth and op- 
posite the second molar tooth. 

Smallpox. — The first sjniiptoms are 
severe headache, backache, rai^id rise 
of temperature and \omiting. The 
eruption appears about the third 



594 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



day. Then the fever subsides and the 
patient sometimes feels perfectly well. 
In mild cases a child may be able to 
play or return to school. The symp- 
toms in mild cases are very similar 
to chickenpox. But observe that 
smallpox cannot occur if a child has 
been successfully vaccinated. If not, 
it Is best to be on the safe side and 
promptly call a ])hysician. 

Chickenpox. — The symptoms are 
those of a cold in the head with a 
slight fever. The characteristic rash 
breaks out the first or second day 
in the form of small blisters. A few 
of these may be seen about the roots 
of the hair, but they occur mostly 
on the body. These soon break and 
produce a drying scab. 

Scabies (Itch) . — Small pimples are 
noticed on the back of the hands and 
especially the spaces between the fin- 
gers or on the arms or whole body. 
These are caused by an animal para- 
site which burrows in the skin. They 
are seldom seen on the face or scalp. 
Itching and an irresistible desire to 
scratch are the principal symptoms. 
These become more intense when the 
patient stands near a hot fire or about 
the time of going to bed at night. 

Pediculosis (Lice). — Intense itch- 
ing and scratching of the hair and 
scalp are indications of vermin. Con- 
stant scratching may cause inflamma- 
tion of the scalp and skin of the neck. 
Look for the eggs (nits) which are 
always stuck on the hair and not 
readily brushed off. 

Ringworm. — All eruptions of the 
skin in the form of circles or rings 
should be examined by a physician 
for ringworm. This is a vegetable 
parasitic skin disease which is com- 
municable. 

Impetigo. — This is a contagious 
disease which is often spread by tow- 
els, toys and other things handled by 
* children. It is characterized by large 
or small pustules (boils) or festers 
upon the skin. These usually appear 
on the face, neck or hands and occa- 
sionally upon the scalp. 

INFANTILE PARALYSIS (ACUTE 
POLIOMYELITIS) 

This is a communicable disease 
which has become epidemic in recent 



years and seems to be spreading rap- 
idly throughout the United States. 
It is due to a germ which attacks the 
spinal cord and to a less extent the 
brain. It injures and destroys the 
tissues, and causes temporary or per- 
manent paralysis of the muscles. 

It attacks chiefly young children 
during the first year of teething, but 
may also be communicated to older 
children, and adults are not exempt. 
Hence the name infantile paralysis 
is somewhat misleading. The nature 
and source of this disease were for- 
merly obscure, but recently Flexner 
has proved it to have all the charac- 
teristics of a germ disease and, early 
in 1913, he announced that the specific 
germ by which it is caused has been 
isolated. 

If the germs of this disease become 
as widespread as those of measles 
or scarlet fever, the result will be ap- 
palling. Not only is the death rate 
high, but the after effects, in about 
three-fourths of all cases, are more 
or less severe permanent paralysis 
of the arms or legs, or other parts of 
the body. The death rate varies in 
different localities from 5 per cent to 
20 per cent. The disease is most pre- 
valent in July, August and September. 
In respect to its permanent after ef- 
fects it has the saddest results of all 
diseases. 

Modes of Infection. — The germs 
gain entrance into the system through 
the mucous surfaces of the nose and 
throat. Infection may be direct by 
inhaling germs from the breath laden 
with infection from the mucous sur- 
faces of the patient's nose and throat; 
or indirect, from the clothing of the 
nurse, physician, or other bedside visi- 
tor, or from objects contaminated in 
the sick room. There is danger also 
from the healthy carriers of the dis- 
ease. Epidemics are probably due 
to mild cases and to " carriers " trav- 
eling, or attending daj' or Sunday 
schools, fairs, or other public gather- 
ings. 

Symptoms. — The period of incuba- 
tion is from one to fourteen days. 
The average is from five to ten days. 
This is one of the most difficult of all 
diseases to recognize, unless the phy- 
sician is put on guard by the pres- 



PREVENTABLE DISEASES OF CHILDREN 595 



ence of other cases in the locality. 
It is especially difficult to recognize 
in the case of children. The onset of 
the disease is usually sudden. The 
fever rises to from 101° to 103° in the 
first twenty-four hours. There is 
usually malaise, profuse sweating, 
vomiting and general severe pains in 
the arms and back, sometimes re- 
ferred to the joints. Convulsions fre- 
quently occur in children. Tender- 
ness, generally in the lower extremi- 
ties, less frequently in the spine and 
trunk, but sometimes in the upper 
limbs and neck, is a frequent and 
highly important symptom. 

Paralysis of one or both legs gen- 
erally occurs within from twelve 
hours to three or four days, but the 
paralysis may extend to any part of 
the body. The fever lasts from five 
to nine days, accompanied by deliri- 
um, but rarely rises above 104° even 
in fatal cases. Diarrhoea often sets 
in on the second day. 

This disease often occurs in a mild- 
er form without paralysis, and these 
cases may give the form that kills. A 
physician should be promptly sum- 
moned in suspicious cases, especially 
if this disease has been reported in the 
locality. The patient should be iso- 
lated until a positive diagnosis can 
be made. 

Prevention. — The work of Flexner 
gives strong hope of the discovery of 
an antitoxin for poliomyelitis, but at 
present there is no certain means of 
cure. Hence the only safety lies in 
preventive measures. Children should 
be kept absolutely away from homes 
in which this disease has appeared 
and from association with members 
of the afflicted families, even though 
they are apparently well. The pa- 
tient should be isolated and the sick- 
room should be prepared in all re- 
spects as for typhoid, and every sani- 
tary precaution suggested for that 
disease should be observed. As the 
infection is present chiefly in the dis- 
charges from the nose and throat, spe- 
cial care should be taken to receive 
them on soft cloths which should be 
prom])tly burned. The nurse and 
physician should take the precaution 
to suspend a cloth moistened in a dis- 
infectant solution over their mouth 



and nostrils when approaching the 
patient closely enough to take his in- 
fected breath. 

The use of a 10 per cent solution of 
peroxide of hydrogen as a gargle or 
spray for the throat is advised both 
for the patient and also for the 
nurse, physician and members of the 
family, or others who may have been 
exposed to the infection. Contact 
with this substance kills all germs of 
this disease. 

Special care should be taken to dis- 
infect all excreta from the patient. 
The germs have great vitality, and 
being extremely small, it is probable 
they may be scattered through the 
air on particles of dust. Hence spe- 
cial care should be observed to wash 
floors, rather than sweep them, and 
to dust only with cloths wet with a 
disinfectant. After the death or re- 
covery of the patient, the room 
should be disinfected with about dou- 
ble the ordinary quantity' of sulphur 
or formaldehyde, and on account of 
the extreme vitality of the germ, the 
entire exposed floor and all surfaces, 
woodwork and furnishings should 
also be washed with full strength 
standard solution. No. 3, bichloride of 
mercury. 

Quarantine. — Most boards of 
health now require all cases to be re- 
ported, the premises to be placarded, 
and strict quarantine maintained. 
No one except the nurse and physi- 
cian should be admitted to the sidi 
room during the sickness, or for some 
months after recovery. There is 
danger that the patient may continue 
to carry the germs of the disease. 
Several epidemics have been stamped 
out by strict quarantine. The period 
of infection is not precisely known, 
but is supposed to be chiefly while the 
fever lasts — usually about three 
weeks. The quarantine of the other 
members of the family than the pa- 
tient need not extend beyond tliis 
period. The bread winners should 
board and room elsewhere esjiecially 
during the quarantine period and for 
three weeks after their last ex}>osure. 
Thej' .should avoid all public gather- 
ings and mingle as little as ]Hissible 
with other persons. Or, preferably, 
the patient should be removed to a 



596 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



hospital at the outset of the dis- 
ease. 

CEREBROSPINAL MENINGITIS 

This malady, also called sjjotted 
fever, or simply meningitis, was for- 
merly one of the most terrible and 
fatal of all diseases, the mortality 
in some local epidemics running up 
to as high as 100 per cent. It is an 
inflammation of the membrane cover- 
ing the brain and spinal cord and is 
caused by a specific germ. 

Flexner has discovered a serum 
which cures this disease and leads to 
the hope that a similar antitoxin may 
be discovered for the control of in- 
fantile paralysis. The germ of this 
disease has been identified, and is al- 
ways present in the brain and spinal 
cord of the patient, and in the spinal 
fluid. It may also occur in the nasal 
passages of the patient and of healthy 
carriers who have been infected from 
him. It attacks most frequently chil- 
dren between one and ten years of 
age. It is most prevalent in the late 
winter and spring months, especially 
in March, April and May. It is al- 
ways present in certain neighborhoods 
and may occur at any season of the 
year. 

Modes of Infection. — The germ 
of meningitis occurs in the discharges 
from the mouth, nose and ears of the 
patient, and the infection may be 
spread by direct contact with the pa- 
tient or healthy carriers, or by ob- 
jects infected by Ihem. The germ is 
not thought to live long outside the 
human body. Hence the sjjread of 
the disease is easily controlled by the 
isolation of the patient and by 
proper sanitary precautions. 

Symptoms. — The first symptoms of 
infection are those of an ordinary 
cold. But when the brain is attacked, 
the onset of the disease becomes very 
sudden. There is usually a chill with 
intense headache, vomiting, restless- 
ness, and a great dread of noises and 
bright light. In many cases the red- 
dish spots appear beneath the skin, 
which suggest the name, spotted 
fever. These spots are usually quite 
tender on pressure. The muscles of 
the neck become very stiff and con- 



tract, drawing the head backward. 
This is a characteristic symptom. 
The chill is followed by irregular 
temperatures, sometimes very high. 
After a few hours or days, unless the 
antitoxin serum is injected, the patient 
becomes unconscious and shortly dies. 
Or, in mild cases, the symptoms quick- 
ly subside and recovery is rapid. 

Prevention. — The symptoms of an 
ordinary cold in the head should be 
regarded with suspicion during an epi- 
demic of meningitis. A physician 
should be summoned in all suspicious 
cases, and the patient isolated in the 
sick room as for tyi)hoid fever, until 
a positive diagnosis can be made. 
This may be done by withdrawing a 
sample of the spinal fluid from the 
spinal column by means of a hypoder- 
mic needle. This is a simple proced- 
ure when performed by a competent 
physician, and quite free from dan- 
ger. If the germs of meningitis are 
present, both local and state health 
authorities should be promptly noti- 
fied and the Flexner serum sliould 
be obtained and injected into the 
spinal column by an experienced phy- 
sician. Prompt action is imperative, 
as death will occur in most cases with- 
in a few days unless this remedy is ad- 
ministered. 

The sick must be kept away from 
the well. All discharges, especially 
from the nose and throat, must be 
thoroughly disinfected. The nurse 
or attendant in the sick room, the 
physician and all the members of the 
family who may have been infected 
before the nature of the disease was 
recognized, should thoroughly disin- 
fect the nasal passages and throat by 
a spray or gargle of one part per- 
oxide of hydrogen to three parts of 
water, or with equal parts of water 
and litjuor antiscpticus U. S. P. 
This should be followed by a spray 
of menthol, gum camphor and liquid 
alboline. As an immunizing dose, 
about 10 c. c. of Flexner serum may 
be injected for three or four days, 
twenty-four hours apart, in cases of 
known exposure. 

The use of urotropin in doses of 
from 5 to 10 grains dissolved in wa- M 
ter an hour after meal time, three ^ 
times a day — under the advice of a 



PREVENTABLE DISEASES OF CHILDREN 



597 



physician — as a preventive, is also 
recommended. Observe that if this 
drug is taken too soon after eating, 
digestive disturbances may result. 

These measures with the ordinary 
sanitary precautions in the sick room, 
including disinfection of all excreta, 
have been found to thoroughly con- 
trol this disease. Fresh air and sun- 
shine quickly destroy the germs. 

Quarantine. — Placard the prem- 
ises and keep the members of the 
family to themselves until cultures 
taken from their nasal passages are 
found to be free from germs of the 
disease. After recovery or death, dis- 
infect the house thoroughly with for- 
maldehyde or sulphur. The effect of 
sanitary precautions is proved by 
the fact that nurses and attendants 
very rarely contract this disease. 

DIPHTHERIA 

Diphtheria is a germ disease caused 
by the growth of the diphtheria ba- 
cillus, usually in the throat, nose or 
bronchial tubes. This bacillus was 
discovered by Klebs (1883) and 
shown to be the cause of diphtheria 
by Loeffler (1884), hence it is called 
the Klebs-LoefRer bacillus after its 
discoverers. It throws off in process 
of growth a powerful poison, or 
toxin. This is absorbed in the blood 
and tissues and produces the symp- 
toms of the disease. Adults are not 
as susceptible to this poison as are 
children over one year old, nor are 
all persons equally susceptible. Hence 
all cases are not equally severe. The 
germs are often found in the throat 
or nasal passages of persons who are 
perfectly well or who may exhibit only 
the mildest symptoms. But if there 
is any redness or soreness in the throat 
and the diphtheria bacillus is present, 
the disease should be regarded as 
diphtheria and treated accordingly. 
These bacilli frequently live and grow 
for months and even years in the 
throats and noses of persons who have 
recovered from diphtheria even after 
they have become quite well and 
strong. Recovery from the disease 
does not necessarily mean freedom 
from the germs that caused it. 

Symptoms. — The symptoms of 



diphtheria vary from a mild redness 
of the throat to the formation, in 
severe cases, of a thick, grayish-white 
membrane which may cover the whole 
throat and cause death by choking. 
It is extremely important to recognize 
this disease at the outset, since there 
is an antitoxin which cures diphtheria 
if administered promptly. It is the 
delay in securing treatment that kills. 
A case treated on the first day very 
rarely terminates in death. Every 
case of simple sore throat in children 
should be suspected as possibly diph- 
theritic. Call the doctor early. Give 
antitoxin as soon as a diagnosis of 
diphtheria is made. 

The patient first complains of sore 
throat. This gradually grows worse 
and in a few hours fever is ob- 
served. But sometimes the throat is 
not complained of until the fever has 
appeared. Or nausea and vomiting 
may be the first symptoms. After 
the fever appears the child usually 
becomes sleepy. This condition is 
brought about by the absorption of 
the poisonous product of the germs. 
In severe cases this drowsiness may 
pass into a stupor from which the 
child is hard to rouse. The germs 
do not usually circulate in the blood 
but grow in masses in the throat. 
First a small whitish speck will ap- 
pear on one or both tonsils. The ex- 
tent of this growth varies with the 
severity of the disease from small 
patches to the entire surface of the 
throat. Any grayish deposit on the 
tonsils or other part of the throat, if 
attended with the slightest fever, 
should arouse suspicion and a jjhy- 
sician should be promptly con- 
sulted. 

The first symptom of membranous 
croup or diphtheria of the larynx 
may be a harsh cough or difiiculty in 
breathing. Croupy conditions, not 
promptly relieved by ordinary reme- 
dies, should always be sus]iected as 
possibly diphtheritic, especially if 
there is diphtheria in the community. 
Diphtheria of the lining membrane 
of the nose is frequently mistaken 
for ordinary cold. The discharges, 
however, are different, being fre- 
quently tinged with blood and caus- 
ing lip sores. Such conditions when 



598 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



diphtheria is prevalent should be re- 
garded as susj)icious. 

Diphtheria occurs chiefly in chil- 
dren between the ages of two and fif- 
teen years. Girls are attacked in 
larger numbers than boys. But adults 
are not infrequently infected. The 
disease is most prevalent in late fall. 
It prevails more in winter than in 
summer. It develops in from two to 
seven days, oftenest two days after 
exposure. 

If a child or adult has sore throat 
with the formation of a thick gray- 
white membrane in any part of the 
mouth, throat or nose, the disease is 
diphtheria. The sick room should be 
made ready, as recommended under 
typhoid fever, and the patient 
promptly isolated. If there is no 
membrane formation, but the patient 
appears to be stupid, drowsy or much 
prostrated, the case may be diphtheria 
and should be isolated until a posi- 
tive diagnosis can be obtained. A 
" culture " should be taken from the 
throat of all persons who have come 
into contact with the patient before 
he was isolated. If the germs of 
diphtheria are present they should be 
protected by an immunizing dose of 
1,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin. 

Prevention and Disinfection. — 
Isolate the patient in a sick room pre- 
pared as recommended for typhoid 
fever and observe all the precautions 
therein suggested to ])revent secon- 
dary infection. The germs are most 
nnmerous in the discharges from the 
nose and throat. Hence take especial 
care to receive the sputum on soft 
rags which should be promptly 
burned, or in a sputum cup contain- 
ing disinfectants No. 4, carbolic acid 
(5 per cent), or No. 5, formalin (.5 
per cent). The nurse and attending 
physician should wear a gown of 
washable material, preferably with a 
hood, to avoid carrying the infection 
in their hair and clothing. After the 
recovery or death of the patient, the 
sick room should be thoroughly dis- 
infected by formaldehyde or sulphur 
fumigation. 

Quarantine. — Quarantine the en- 
tire household as recommended un- 
der scarlet fever. Keep children from 
day and Sunday school. Keep the 



members of the family indoors and 
arrange for the bread-winners to 
board and room elsewhere. Quaran- 
tine must be continued until the 
diphtheria bacilli disajipear from the 
throat of the patient. This will or- 
dinarily require about four weeks 
after recovery. "Cultures" should 
then be taken by the physician and 
quarantine should not be lifted until 
the bacilli are found to be absent 
from two successive " cultures." Re- 
member that the mild cases and well 
persons who are carrying the germs 
of the disease are the most danger- 
ous sources of infection. The only 
sure precaution is the bacteriological 
test made by a competent physician 
and the isolation of all infected per- 
sons until the bacillus disappears. 

SCARLET FEVER 

Scarlet fever has all the character- 
istics of a germ disease, though the 
specific germ which causes it has not 
yet been identified. Hence there is 
no antitoxin against scarlet fever and 
no efficient method for its control. 
Scarlatina, scarlet rash, canker rash, 
fever rash and Duke's disease are 
merely other names for scarlet fever. 
They are often applied to the mild 
cases under the mistaken belief that 
these are a different and less danger- 
ous malady, but this is not the case. 
The mild cases will give the form 
that kills. Scarlet fever is highly con- 
tagious, but, like other germ diseases, 
is wholly i)reventable. It is, or should 
be, among the most dreaded of all the 
acute diseases of childhood. It at- 
tacks chiefly children between the ages 
of one and 10 years, although about 5 
per cent of all cases occur in adult 
life. The death rate is about one out 
of every fifteen or twenty cases. 

Occasionally parents expose a child 
to a mild case from the mistaken no- 
tion that all children must have the 
disease and that it is best to have it 
light. Parents frequently permit chil- 
dren suffering from mild cases or 
convalescing to play about the house 
or even run about the neighborhood 
at will. Such contacts of infected 
with healthy children are of great 
assistance in spreading the disease. 



PREVENTABLE DISEASES OF CHILDREN 699 



Persons who knowingly permit them 
often cause cases of death, and with 
the increase of sanitary knowledge 
the law will undoubtedly recognize 
such crimes and visit them with ap- 
propriate penalties. After childhood 
the liability to take the disease is 
very much lessened. Many persons 
who escape the disease in childhood 
have been immune to it although 
many times exposed in later life. 
Two-thirds of all deaths occur in 
children under five. When the dis- 
ease does not kill it frequently leaves 
its victim crippled for life. The 
commonest after-effects are inflam- 
mation of the kidneys, heart, ears, 
glands and joints. Deafness some- 
times results. Hence although one 
attack usually renders a patient im- 
mune, the utmost care should be 
taken to protect all children from ex- 
posure. 

Symptoms. — The period of incuba- 
tion after exposure varies from one 
to fourteen days. Hence, a child ex- 
posed to scarlet fever should be care- 
fully watched during the following 
two weeks. Upon the first symptoms 
of shivering, lassitude, headache, fre- 
quent pulse, hot, dry skin, flushed 
face, furred tongue with much thirst 
and loss of appetite, the sick room 
should be prepared as for typhoid 
fever and the patient isolated until a 
positive diagnosis can be made by a 
physician. 

Vomiting is usually among the first 
positive symptoms. Other symptoms 
are sore throat, intense fever with 
headache or backache, and the char- 
acteristic scarlet rash. This usually 
appears in from twelve to twenty- 
four hours, first upon the lower part 
of the neck and adjacent parts of the 
chest and afterwards gradually 
spreading over the entire body. This 
disease, like typhoid or diphtheria, 
appears in varying degrees of sever- 
ity. It may cause death within twen- 
ty-four hours or may be so mild that 
the patient does not feel sick enough 
to stay in bed. There are many true 
cases of this malady with a very low 
fever and without vomiting or other 
acute symptoms, or even without the 
characteristic rash. A child with a 
sore throat is under suspicion of scar- 



let fever or diphtheria and should be 
kept away from school and from 
other children until a positive diag- 
nosis can be made. 

Running Ear. — During the third 
or fourth week of the disease, it is 
possible that the ears may become 
diseased and lead to what is known 
as a " running ear." The child by 
this time has had no fever for a 
number of days. He suddenly be- 
comes more or less feverish and rest- 
less, and complains at the same time 
of pain in the ear. This is a danger 
signal and calls for immediate action 
by the doctor. If this condition goes 
untreated, it may result in a running 
ear which sometimes lasts for years. 
With proper treatment, however," most 
of these cases are soon cured. 

Acute Nephritis, or inflammation of 
the kidneys, develops, at times, in the 
third to the fifth week of the disease. 
The child, who has seemed to be al- 
most well, suddenly develops a fever. 
He complains of headache , usually 
vomits and may have convulsions. The 
amount of urine passed is small. The 
patient may complain of trouble with 
the eyes, and of not being able to see 
distinctly. Should any of these symp- 
toms develop, the doctor should be 
called immediately. 

Modes of Infection. — This disease 
is spread through carelessness. Every 
case comes directly, or indirectly, 
from some previous case, either by 
direct infection from inhaling the 
breath of a scarlet fever patient, or 
by secondary contact infection. INIost 
cases of direct infection are due to 
neglect of mild cases and carelessness 
of those recovering from the disease. 
If every case could be thoroughly iso- 
lated — quarantined — the disease 
would disappear from the face of the 
earth. The only safe course to pur- 
sue is to isolate the patient and to 
quarantine and disinfect the sick room 
in all respects as for ty])hoid fever. 

The nurse and attending j)hysician 
should wear a hooded gown of wash- 
able material to avoid carrying infec- 
tion from the sick room u])on tlie hair 
or clothing. On leaving the sick room 
this gown may be disinfected by 
sprinkling it with one or two table- 
spoonfuls of 40 per cent solution of 



600 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



formaldehyde and packing it in a 
small valise or other tightly closed 
receptacle. Both the nurse and })hy- 
sician should avoid direct infection 
from the patient's breath. No one 
else should be permitted to enter the 
sick room. 

The chief danger from contact in- 
fection is from scales from the skin, 
the spittle from the throat and mouth 
and the nose and ear discharges. But 
all the discharges of the patient 
should be disinfected as for typhoid 
fever. By confining the patient ab- 
solutely to the sick room until the 
danger of infection is passed and by 
])ro])er and efficient disinfection, as 
elsewhere recommended, the spread 
of the disease can be absolutely pre- 
vented. 

The germs of scarlet fever are 
very long-lived. They may communi- 
cate the infection after many months 
and at long distances by means of 
clothing, playthings, books, maga- 
zines, bedding, towels or any articles 
of household furniture or other ob- 
jects on which the contagion from the 
patient may have lodged. Hence 
nothing should be removed from the 
sick room without having first been 
thoroughly disinfected. 

Quarantine. — Most cities require 
strict quarantine in cases of scarlet 
fever. Keep the children from both 
day and Sunday school. Take care 
that the nurse and all members of 
the family remain indoors. Arrange 
for the bread-winners to room and 
board elsewhere during the course of 
the disease. Have milk and groceries 
left at the door and disinfect all ar- 
ticles even including letters and postal 
cards. This may be done by baking 
them in a suitable receptacle at a 
temperature of about ^50 degrees. 

Or, place the articles in an air- 
tight receptacle with a closely-fitting 
cover, sprinkle them freely with a 40 
l)er cent solution of formaldehyde, 
cover tightly and leave the receptacle 
in a warm room for at least four 
hours. No milk or groceries should be 
sold in, or accepted from, premises 
quarantined for scarlet fever. Milk 
from infected dairies is a frequent 
source of contagion. 

Desquamation or " Peeling " is a 



highly characteristic phase of scarlet 
fever. After the rash begins to fade 
the fever disappears and the patient 
usually feels good and is anxious to 
get out and i)lay. The skin affected 
by the rash now begins to scale or 
peel from all parts of the body, 
sometimes in large or small flakes, 
but often in the form of a dry mealy 
powder. This is charged with the 
virus of the disease in its most in- 
fectious form. The process of peel- 
ing occupies a variable time from ten 
days to six weeks and this is the most 
contagious period of the disease. The 
infectious dry skin is easily spread 
about the room and may be carried 
elsewhere upon the clothing of mem- 
bers of the family, or other objects. 
Or it may remain attached to articles 
of furniture, or as dust in out-of-the- 
way places, to Infect others with whom 
it may come in contact. To prevent 
all this, the patient must be confined 
to the sick room and bathed daily, 
under the advice of the attending phy- 
sician, with soap and warm water. 
Bathing with disinfectants is not ad- 
visable. But the water used for the 
bath must afterwards be thoroughly 
disinfected. 

After the bath the patient should 
be anointed with sweet or olive oil 
containing a little oil of eucalyptus, 
or 3 per cent of carbolic acid or with 
^2 per cent carbonized vaseline, or a 
boracic acid ointment at the discre- 
tion of the attending ])hysician. This 
will not only allay the itching from 
the rash, but will confine the dry scales 
to the body and bed linen and facili- 
tate the work of disinfection. This 
should be continued until the skin is 
entirely smooth. The soles of tiie feet 
and palms of the hand are usually the 
last to peel. 

Duration of Quarantine. — The 
length of time during which a scar- 
let fever jjatient is dangerous to oth- 
ers differs widely. Isolation must be 
enforced until all peeling or scaling 
off of the skin is completed, and un- 
til there is no further discharge from 
the ears, nose, throat, suppurating 
glands or inflammation of tiie kidneys. 
The time required for scaling varies 
from four to eight weeks. The soles 
of the feet and palms of the hands are 



PREVENTABLE DISEASES OF CHILDREN 



601 



I 



the last to peel. Mild cases with very 
little scaling and without ear, nose, 
throat, kidney and glandular complica- 
tions, should be isolated not less than 
four weeks, and severe cases not less 
than six weeks. This period must be 
prolonged if the ears, nose, throat, 
glands or kidneys continue to be dis- 
eased. The advice of a reliable phy- 
sician should be followed in all cases. 
Disinfection. — After death or re- 
covery disinfect the sick room and 
its contents thoroughly as elsewhere 
described. 

MEASLES 

Measles is the most contagious 
eruptive disease of childhood. It is 
probably a germ disease, but the 
germ by which it is caused has not 
yet been identified. German measles 

— more properly Rotheln or Rubella 

— is not a form of measles nor is it 
a mild type of scarlet fever. It is 
a distinct disease, black measles — 
the malignant type of the disease — is 
very fatal. The black color is due to 
hemorrhages in the skin. Measles 
may occur at any time during the 
year, but is most prevalent in the fall 
and winter months. 

Symptoms. — The period of incuba- 
tion is from ten to fourteen days 
after exposure. The symptoms for 
the first two or three days are very 
much like those of an ordinary cold 
in the head. The eyes become red 
and watery and are sensitive to light. 
The nose is stopped up or there is a 
discharge from the nose, with sneez- 
ing. The throat is sore and there is 
a dry, hard, high-pitched cough. The 
tonsils may be swollen or red, head- 
ache, fever, loss of appetite, drowsi- 
ness and irritability are usually ob- 
served. 

Occasionally the disease comes on 
suddenly with vomiting and high 
fever, but usually the fever is not 
very high. It may disappear on the 
second or third day with improve- 
ment of all the other symptoms. 
Then the temperature again rises and 
continues very high until the fourth 
day when the eruption appears. The 
disease is contagious from the outset 
of the earliest symptoms. Hence any 



one suffering from these symptoms 
should be isolated and kept under ob- 
servation for three or four days, espe- 
cially if measles is prevalent. Chil- 
dren should be kept from both day 
and Sunday school. 

The characteristic skin eruption ap- 
pears on the fourth day on the face 
and neck and thence over the whole 
body as dull red blotches a little 
raised, and later running together. It 
gives the skin a peculiar mottled ap- 
pearance. Before this occurs one 
cannot be positive that the case is 
one of measles. But generally there 
is an eruption of some light red spots 
on the inside of the cheeks two or 
three days before the external erup- 
tion. If care is taken to be on the 
lookout for this symptom the nature 
of the disease may be determined 
early. The eruption lasts usually 
four or five days and disappears as 
the other symptoms improve. It is 
followed by a fine bran-like desqua- 
mation or peeling, which is usually 
complete in about a week. 

Prognosis. — Measles is quite com- 
monly regarded as a slight and triv- 
ial disorder. Hence parents not in- 
frequently expose young children to 
this malady from the mistaken no- 
tion that they are certain to contract 
it some time and the sooner it is 
over the better. It is true that the 
disease is more severe in adult life. 
But on the other hand it is a very 
fatal disease among young children. 
It causes about three times as many 
deaths as smallpox and nearly as 
many as scarlet fever. Measles and 
whooping cough together cause near- 
ly as many deaths as diphtheria. The 
mortality from measles is much 
higher than is generally supposed. 
Ninety-five per cent, of all deaths oc- 
cur in children under five years of 
age, and far more deaths occur under 
than over two years of age. The 
death rate from measles in times of 
epidemic ranges from 4 per cent to 
6 per cent and not infrequently ex- 
ceeds that from scarlet fever. 

The danger from measles is chiefly 
due to complication with other dis- 
eases, such as whooping cough and 
bronchial pneumonia, or to after-ef- 
fects, such as consumption, paralysis, 



602 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



meningitis, diseases of the skin and 
nervous disorders. Inflammation of 
the ear is a not infrequent complica- 
tion of measles. This often leads to 
deafness or worse. Latent tubercu- 
losis in a child often becomes active 
after an attack of measles. If a child 
" seems to have caught cold " after 
measles consult a doctor at once. 
Hence exposure to infection should be 
avoided and every case should receive 
skilled medical attention. 

Practically everj' one is susceptible 
to measles. One attack usually pro- 
tects a person against others, but 
this rule is by no means invariable. 
The course of the disease is usually 
more severe in adult life, hence in 
the management of the sick room ob- 
serve all the usual sanitary precau- 
tions. 

Modes of Infection. — Measles is 
contagious from tlie beginning of the 
symptoms — usually three or four 
days before the eru])tion occurs. It 
is during this first stage of the dis- 
ease, when the symptoms can hardly 
be distinguished from those of an 
ordinary cold in the head, that direct 
infection is most often communi- 
cated. The disease is usually con- 
ve3'^ed to others by direct exposure but 
may be conveyed by the discharges of 
the nose and throat and possibly from 
the fragments of skin thrown ofiF from 
the surface of the body during peel- 
ing. Infection may be carried by the 
clothing of the patient, or those who 
come in contact with him, and by other 
objects. But the germs are not near- 
ly so long-lived as those of diphtheria 
and scarlet fever. Hence the danger 
from secondary infection is much less. 
Mild cases may give the disease in 
its most malignant form and are 
equally as contagious. 

Quarantine. — When measles is 
prevalent and especially if there is 
likelihood that exposure has occurred, 
children should be kept under close 
observation for ten days to two 
weeks and promptly isolated on the 
appearance of the first sj'mptoms. 
If red spots are not observed on the 
inside of the cheeks within two days, 
or if the eruption does not break out 
within four or five days after the first 
feverish symptoms, the case may be 



regarded as a simple cold in the head. 
But if there is any evidence of erup- 
tion, however mild, isolate the child in 
the sick room prepared as for typhoid 
fever and promptly summon a phy- 
sician. 

Isolate promptly all suspicious 
cases, especially during periods of 
epidemic. Placard the premises. 
Keep all visitors out of the sick room. 
Protect, especially, children under five 
years of age and adults who have 
never had the disease. The disease is 
conununicable imtil the peeling is 
complete, which will be, as a rule, 
within three weeks from the onset of 
the malady. 

The quarantine must be continued 
until the patient's temperature has 
been normal for forty-eight hours. 
Persons exposed to measles and who 
have never had the disease should 
be quarantined for two weeks from 
time of exposure. Adults who have 
had the disease may go about their 
ordinary business, providing they 
keep entirely away from the sick 
room. But no person from a home 
quarantined for measles should at- 
tend school, church, theater, or other 
public gathering. Everything coming 
from the patient's room should be 
disinfected. After recovery or death 
the sick room should be thoroughly 
disinfected with formaldehyde or sul- 
phur as elsewhere recommended. 

WHOOPING COUGH 

This is a highly contagious disease 
characterized by severe inflammation 
of the bronchial tubes and accom- 
panied by a peculiar cough ending in 
the familiar " whoop." It has all 
the characteristics of a germ dis- 
ease but the germ which causes it 
has not yet been identified. Persons 
of all ages are liable to the attacks 
of this malady but practically all 
deaths occur under the age of five 
years. One-half of these occur un- 
der one year of age. The average 
age of death is one and a half years. 

Whooping cough, when severe, is 
a debilitating disease at any time of 
life. It lasts for several weeks and 
is not infrequently complicated with 
pneumonia. It often leads to chronic 



PREVENTABLE DISEASES OF CHILDREN 



603 



invalidism from exhaustion, with 
heart and lung changes which may be 
permanent. The disease may occur 
at any time of the year but the great- 
est mortality is in July and August. 
Children should never be knowingly 
exposed to whooping cough and great 
care should be taken to protect chil- 
dren imder five years of age from in- 
fection. After this period the likeli- 
hood of infection is much lessened 
and the danger of death from this 
disease is practically over. Many 
persons escape this malady altogether. 

Symptoms. — The period of incuba- 
tion is from four to fourteen days 
after exposure. The symptoms for 
the first few days are those of an 
ordinary cold or simple catarrh but 
with less fever than measles. The 
cough is more severe than the other 
symptoms seem to warrant and grows 
harsher from day to day. After a 
week or ten days the characteristic 
whoop develops. This continues with 
varying degrees of severity for a 
month or six weeks. Then the par- 
oxysms cease, often leaving a simple 
catarrhal cough which may last in- 
definitely. 

Modes of Infection. — Infection is 
ordinarily by direct and fairly inti- 
mate contact between the infected 
and healthy person. The virus of the 
disease is not as long lived as that 
of diphtheria or scarlet fever and 
hence not so likely to be conveyed 
from the sick room on the hands and 
clothing of the nurse or by means of 
other objects. The disease is prob- 
ably not spread through the air ex- 
cept within the range of the fine spray 
thrown from the mouth of the patient 
while coughing. 

Quarantine. — Isolate the patient in 
a sick room prepared as recommend- 
ed for typhoid fever, especially if there 
is an infant in the family under two 
years of age. Keep on the safe side 
by observing all the sanitary precau- 
tions recommended for the sick room 
in other communicable diseases and 
disinfect the sick room after the death 
or recovery of the patient. 

MTTMPS 

Mumps is a glandular swelling in 
the angle between the jaw and the 



ear. It is a highly contagious but 
wholly unnecessary and preventable 
disease. It chiefly affects children, 
but may attack older persons who 
have not become immune from hav- 
ing had the disease in childhood. It 
usually develops in from two to three 
weeks after exposure. 

Symptoms. — The early symptoms 
are fever with pain below the ear on 
one or both sides. A slight swelling 
below one ear may be first noticed. 
Within two days there is great en- 
largement of the neck and side of 
the cheek. The other side usually be- 
comes afi^ected within a day or two. 
The swelling persists from seven to 
ten days then gradually subsides. A 
second or even a third attack may 
occur and troublesome complications 
are quite common. It is always ad- 
visable to consult a physician. 

ftuarantine. — Isolate the patient in 
the sick room and exclude other chil- 
dren and adults who have not had 
the disease. Keep children from 
school for a period of three weeks 
following their last exposure. 

PARASITIC DISEASES 

Pediculosis (Lice). — There are 
three varieties of these parasites 
which infest human beings, the head 
louse, body louse and crab louse. A 
single family of children so infested 
may communicate them to many 
others through the contacts of outer 
clothing hung up in school dressing 
rooms, or in play, or otherwise. In 
most states sucli children may be ex- 
cluded from schools until these para- 
sites have been exterminated. The 
following methods of treatment for 
killing parasites and nits are recom- 
mended: 

Add two teaspoonfuls of chloro- 
naphtholeum disinfectant to a pint of 
warm water. Wet the hair with this 
mixture. Put a towel around the 
head and let it dry on. When the 
hair is dry comb with a fine comb. 
Repeat this two or three times until 
the head is clear of vermin. The nits 
may be removed by combing the hair 
after it has been moistened with vine- 
gar. 

Or obtain half a pint of crude pe- 



604 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



troleum at a drug store and wet the 
hair thoroughly with this. Keeji it 
wet for three hours. Then wash the 
whole head with warm water and 
soap. Repeat this process on three 
successive days. The nits may then 
be removed by combing the hair very 
carefully with a fine-tooth comb wet 
with vinegar. Repeat the combing 
for several days until no more nits 
can be found. To make the treat- 
ment easier and more thorough, the 
hair may be cut short, if there is no 
objection. 

All the children in a family are like- 
ly to be aflFected, and should also be 
treated as above. 

Brushes and combs should be 
cleansed by putting them in boiling 
water for a few minutes. 

Or head lice may promptly be de- 
stroyed with common kerosene. 
Pour a little into a small dish. Mois- 
ten a small rag with it. After squeez- 
ing the rag somewhat, moisten the 
hair with the kerosened rag. Do this 
in the afternoon, after the children 
return from school, or in the evening. 
Before morning the oil will have evap- 
orated so that little or no odor will 
remain. Or remove both oil and odor 
with soap and water. Or to disguise 
the odor of kerosene, pour a small 
quantity into a vial, and add an equal 
amount, or less, of oil of sassafras. 
Shake until there is a complete mix- 
ture. 

Or, dip a small, clean hairbrush into 
kerosene oil or oil of sassafras poured 
into a shallow dish. Then brush and 
moisten the hair with it. 

Make these applications by daylight 
and be very careful not to let the 
children go near fire or lights. For 
the night, cover the head with a cap, 
which can be imi)rovised by knotting 
the corners of a handkerchief, or wrap 
a cloth around it. Repeat this treat- 
ment several times to ensure complete 
destruction of the lice and nits. Ap- 
plied as recommended, kerosene is not 
in any way injurious to the scalp or 
hair. 

Body Lice (Pediculus Vestimen- 
torum). — This parasite belongs to 
the same family as head lice but is 
somewhat larger. It is found com- 
monly on the body, where it goes only 



for the purpose of feeding. In the 
adult form it can be diflFcrentiated 
from the head louse by dark trans- 
verse bands across the back. The 
parasite lives and reproduction oc- 
curs chiefly in the various folds and 
seams of the clothing, and especially 
where the skin is most conveniently 
reached. Hence the various lesions 
are to be found most often around the 
neck, across the shoulders, the upper 
part of the back, around the waist and 
the outside of the thighs. 

Treatment should be directed to 
the infested clothing where the para- 
site and nits are to be found. In or- 
der to destroy these, all garments 
should be thoroughly baked, boiled 
or lightly sprinkled and gone over 
with a very hot iron. 

However, it has been observed that 
some of the ova or nits are attached 
to the fine hairs (lanugo) of the 
body surface. Hence a general tub 
bath disinfected with corrosive sub- 
limate is advisable. Eight tablets of 
bichloride of mercury to a tub of wa- 
ter makes a strong enough solution. 
After the bath, flush the tub thor- 
oughly to avoid injury to the plumb- 
ing and fixtures. 

Or clothing, beds and bedding, and 
the like may be rid of these insects 
and parasites of all other kinds, by 
fumigation with sulj^hur. 

Crab Lice (PhtMrius Inguin- 
alis). — These are a smaller species of 
the same family as head or body lice 
but are quite distinct on account of 
their shape. They are nearly as wide 
as long. Their strong legs, spread 
out laterally, give them the ap]iear- 
ance of crabs. They are of whitish 
color, somewhat shaded on the shoul- 
ders, and the legs have a slightly 
red tinge. Each is about one-tenth of 
an incli in length. They are to be 
found on the various hairy regions of 
the body other than the scalj). They 
do not thrive among the fine hairs of 
the head, though they have often been 
observed in the eyebrows. 

Treatment. — Repeated washings 
with vinegar or diluted acetic acid 
will free the hairs of ova. This 
should be followed by a careful daily 
shampoo of all the regions involved. 
After the shampoo, apply freely a 



PREVENTABLE DISEASES OF CHILDREN 605 



solution of corrosive sublimate con- 
taining one tablet to a pint of water. 
If not desirable to use the mercury 
wash, apply a lotion consisting of 
tincture of larkspur, i ounce; com- 
mercial ether, 8 ounces. Or use a 
stronger solution, consisting of equal 
parts of the two ingredients. After- 
wards cover the parts with a closely 
applied dressing. 

Cautions. — Corrosive sublimate 
(bichloride of mercury) is a power- 
ful poison. Ether is highly inflam- 
mable. 

The Itch Mite. — This is a minute 
bug which gives rise to the condition 
commonly known as " Itch," " Seven- 
Year Itch," " Army Itch," " Jackson 
Itch " and many other synonymous 
names. The female burrows into the 
superficial skin forming a tortuous 
or, at times, a straight, dotted, 
slightly elevated line. This varies in 
length from one-eighth to one-half 
inch. The burrow is dark gray or 
blackish in color, thread-like, and may 
be slightly more elevated at one end. 

This mite is transmitted from one 
individual to another by occupancy, 
either of the same bed, or of one 
on which the sheets have not been 
changed. It maj'^ also be transmitted 
by the use of a common towel and by 
shaking hands. It is commonly 
found in the moist surfaces of the 
body, such as between the fingers, on 
the hands or folds of the wrist, in 
the folds under the shoulder, the low- 
er portion of the abdomen and about 
the neck. Its entire existence is 
spent on its human host. It is be- 
lieved not to have any power to 
transmit disease, but may be inimical 
to the health of the individual from 
secondarj'^ infection of the burrows 
or of the excoriations produced by 
scratching. There may be also vary- 
ing degrees of papular or pustular 
lesions over the infected regions. 

These mites usually thrive best in 
unsanitary conditions. To destroy 
them, thoroughly boil or bake all bed 
linen and clothing used by the in- 
fected individual. If woolens are in 
use, bake them or sprinkle lightly 
and thoroughly iron them with a very 
hot iron. Take a hot bath, and rub 
down with a coarse washcloth or 



brush. This opens up the burrows 
and exposes the eggs for destruction. 
After the bath, rub in an ointment 
made up as follows: Sublimed sul- 
phur, 1 dram (I teaspoonful) ; bal- 
sam of Peru, 1 dram (1 teaspoon- 
ful) ; vaseline, 1 ounce (2 table- 
spoonfuls). Repeat morning and 
evening from two to four days. In 
particularly serious cases, repeat this 
entire treatment at the end of one 
week. 

Or use either of the following 
preparations: 

(1) Mix equal parts of balsam of 
Peru and lard. Rub these together 
thoroughly in a shallow plate with a 
steel table knife to form an oint- 
ment. Or use vaseline in place of 
lard, or still better, lanolin. 

(3) Or mix flt)wers of sulphur, 1 
tablespoonful; balsam of Peru, two 
tablespoonfuls ; lard or vaseline, 8 
tablespoonfuls. Make into an oint- 
ment. 

Take a hot bath and give the whole 
body a thorough scrubbing with soap 
and hot water. Dry the body well. 
Now with the palm of the hand, rub 
one of these ointments thoroughly 
into every part of the body from the 
neck downward, or, at least, anoint 
all parts of the body which are af- 
fected. Sometimes the only jiarts 
affected at first arc the hands and 
the arms to the elbows. To make 
sure work, particularly in bad cases, 
make two or three applications with- 
in twenty-four or thirty-six hours. 
Take another hot bath twelve hours 
or so after the last application. 
Thorough scrubbing and cleanliness 
go a long way toward effecting a 
cure. 

To avoid reinfection put on clean 
clothes, particularly underclothing, 
and change sheets and blankets, par- 
ticularly after the last soap and wa- 
ter bath. Deposit all infected cloth- 
ing and bed linen in a standard dis- 
infectant solution of carl)olic acid 
(5 per cent), or formaldehyde (3 
per cent), or boil in soap and water 
at least one hour. 

Balsam of Peru is sometimes 
painted on pure, or mixed with an 
equal amount of glycerine. To make 
this mixture fill a bottle half full,

BEFORE THE BABY COMES 

A poorly fed or sickly mother 
cannot give birth to a vigorous, 
healthy infant and successfully nurse 
it. Such a mother rarely carries her 
baby for the full nine months. A 
woman who has had repeated mis- 
carriages or whose previous labors 
have come on before time should, 
early in pregnancy, consult her phy- 
sician in order that the underlying 
cause may be cured or alleviated. 
During pregnancy and especially in 
the latter months, the expectant 
mother must have abundant rest and 
spare herself as much as possible. 
An extra amount of sleep is required 
and daytime rest for an hour or two 
is desirable. Select and consult your 
physician early in pregnancy. Keep 
yourself in good health. Hard 
household labor or factory work dur- 
ing the latter months tend to bring 
about miscarriages or the birth of 
puny and undersized children. 

Exercise. — Exercise in the open air 
in the form of walks should be taken 
throughout the entire course of preg- 
nancy. Violent exercise in any form 
should be prohibited. Unnecessary 
stair climbing must be avoided in 
the latter months. The sewing ma- 
chine must not be used towards the 
end. Should labor be threatened be- 
fore the proper time, go to bed at 



607 



once and remain perfectly quiet until 
the danger is well passed. 

Care of the Breasts. — Small, flat- 
tened or depressed nipples should be 
drawn out with the forefinger and 
thumb and held for five minutes 
night and morning during the two 
months before the baby is born. The 
nipples should also be carefully 
anointed each night with white vase- 
line. This will soften and remove 
the milky substance which is secreted 
at this time, and which may other- 
wise form hard crusts, and 'ulcerate 
the soft tissues beneath. Wash the 
nipples every day with castile soap 
and water and put boracic acid solu- 
tion on them, a heaping tablespoon- 
ful to the pint of water. Or better, 
use warm water, two-thirds, and al- 
cohol, one third. Proper attention 
to the care of the nipples will make 
nursing a pleasure and satisfaction, 
instead of a pain and discomfort. 

After the baby conies, always wash 
the nipples carefully both before and 
after nursing, in "pure, cold water 
containing a teaspoonful of baking 
soda to each pint of water. This 
will prevent them from becoming 
tender. 

Food for the Baby. — No food is as 
good for a baby as its mother's milk. 
This is why so many more bottle ba- 
bies are sick and die than breast 
babies. Ooe or two feedings a day 



608 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



from the breast are a great deal bet- 
ter than none at all. Hence keep 
the body well nourished before the 
birth of the baby in order to secure 
a good supply " of milk. Exercise, 
freedom from excessive worry and 
massage of the breast and nipples be- 
fore the child is born will, in nearly 
every instance, insure the child being 
nursed. Every mother should expect 
and plan to nurse her child. 

Diet. — The diet should be care- 
fully regulated, but abundant. A 
full, wholesome and liberal diet is 
essential. What to eat, however, will 
depend largely on individual tastes 
and habits, as food which agrees with 
one will not agree with another. 
Highly seasoned or very rich food 
should be avoided as well as fatty 
foods and coarse vegetables. 

The following dietary is recom- 
mended during pregnancy and nurs- 
ing: 

Soup — Any kind. 

Fish — Fresh fish, of any kind, 
boiled or broiled. Raw oysters and 
raw clams. 

Meats — Chicken, beef, ham or ba- 
con, veal, lamb, tender lean mutton. 
Red meat in moderation but only 
once a day. 

Cereals — Hominy, oatmeal, farina, 
cream of wheat, rice, mush, shredded 
wheat biscuits, etc. 

Breads — Stale bread, corn bread, 
Graham bread, rye bread, brown 
bread, toast, crackers. 

Vegetables — Potatoes, onions, 
spinach, cauliflower, asparagus, 
green corn, green peas, beans, lettuce 
or other salads, with oil. 

Desserts — Plain puddings, cus- 
tard, junket, ripe raw fruits, stewed 
fruits, ice cream. No pastry. 

Drinks — Tea and coffee very 
sparingly, never more than one cup 
a day. No alcoholic beverages, beer, 
or liquors. At least two quarts of 
water a day. Milk, buttermilk, co- 
coa, malted milk. 

At least one satisfactory move- 
ment of the bowels should take place 
daily; if there is any difficulty about 
this, consult the doctor. But observe 
that strong medicines must not be 
used to open the bowels. Costiveness 



can be avoided by suflBcient exercise 
and suitable food as brown bread, 
stewed vegetables, fruit and abun- 
dance of water. ■ 

Work. — The expectant mother may ■ 
do her usual work, but should not ' 
work hard enough to get very tired. 
Work in stores and mills is not good. 
It should be stopped as soon as pos- 
sible, at least four weeks before the 
expected birth of the child. She 
should go out of doors every day, 
but must not run for cars, or jump, 
or over-exert herself In any way. 

Once in four weeks, at the times 
when the woman would have been 
unwell, if she were not to have a 
baby, she should be even more care- 
ful than usual about over-exertion, 
because at these times there is more 
danger of miscarriage. 

Clothing. — All clothing should be 
loose. As soon as she begins to show 
her condition, the mother should 
leave off her corsets, and have noth- 
ing about the waist that is at all 
tight. A loose corset waist should 
be worn. To this attach side gar- 
ters instead of wearing circular ones 
about the legs. 

Baths. — It is important to keep 
the skin in a healthy condition, and 
this is best done by frequent bath- 
ing. Sea-bathing is not good, how- 
ever, because it is too violent. 

When the Baby Comes. — Send for 
the doctor when the labor ]Kiins be- 
gin. He prefers being called too 
early than too late. A sudden gush 
of water signifies that the membranes 
have ruptured and the mother should 
go to bed at once. 

The bed should be prepared as fol- 
lows: Place a rubber sheet or sev- 
eral thicknesses of newspapers next 
to the mattress and over this a clean 
sheet. Next place three thicknesses 
of news]>apers over the middle and 
edge of the side of the bed and cover 
with a folded sheet and then cover 
with a clean sheet. This top layer of 
papers and sheets can be easily re- 
moved after the labor and the mother 
will lie on a clean, dry sheet. 

Everything should be in readiness 
for the reception and care of the 
baby. Have at hand a warmed flan- 
nel ' blanket in which to place the 



THE CARE OF BABIES

baby after birth, and hot water bot- 
tles with which to surround it if the 
room is cold. Expose the baby as 
little as possible during the bath. 
The clothes and diapers should be 
warmed. Everything that comes in 
contact with the baby should be 
scrupulously clean. 

The mother should insist that a 
drop of silver solution be placed in 
the baby's eyes. This will prevent 
blindness. If the baby weighs less 
than four pounds it can best be 
taken care of in incubators which are 
to be found in any well-equipiied hos- 
pital. Your physician is required to 
make a prompt I'ejiort of the birth 
to the registrar or local board of 
health. This is a matter of great 
importance. Don't let him forget it. 
The mother should remain in bed 
for at least two weeks after con- 
finement. The womb does not re- 
turn to its normal state for five or 
six weeks and no hard worlc or ac- 
tive exercise should be taken during 
this period. 

THE NEW BOEN CHILD 

If a new born infant is to live its 
first requirement is air, its second 
warmth. It is extremely sensitive to 
cold and may be seriously or fatally 
injured by slight exposure to cool 
air. Wrap up the child quickly and 
carefully and do not expose it, except 
momentarily, to a temperature be- 
low blood heat. Do not handle the 
baby during the first few days more 
than is required to insure local clean- 
liness. 

The death rate among infants is at 
its highest point the first week. The 
second week it drops enormously. 
Many babies die thus early because 
the care which they receive within 
the first few hours or days is not in- 
telligent. The first bath coming too 
early kills many. A full bath should 
not be given before the child is ten 
or twelve days old. The first cleans- 
ing of the skin can be done much 
better with olive oil or even lard. 
Apply this to only a small portion of 
the body at a time, then wipe it off 
with pieces of old, soft cotton or 
linen. 



Next to air and warmth among the 
life needs of the new born child is 
sleep. After it has had its initial 
cry, see that the breathing is well 
established and the child is made 
comfortable. Then let the infant 
sleep undisturbed during the first two 
or three days, eighteen or twenty 
hours out of the twenty-four. 

Immediately after birth of a child 
two drops of a 1 per cent fresh solu- 
tion of nitrate of silver should be 
placed in each eye by the nurse or 
attending 2'hysician. This prepara- 
tion costs about two cents and will 
prevent blindness. The eyes should 
be carefully shielded from the light 
until they gradually become accus- 
tomed to it. The need of food is not 
immediate. Nature does not usually 
provide a supply of food for the 
first two or three days and some- 
times not for the first five or six 
days. Hence it is safe to infer that 
a preliminary fast is the best and 
safest for the baby. Observation 
shows that feeding within this time 
is most often injurious. 

When a baby is well it will sleep 
twelve hours or more in every twen- 
ty-four, without being rocked. It 
will nurse every three or four hours 
during the daytime, and after the 
sixth month will be satisfied without 
nursing in the night. It will gain 
about six ounces in weight every 
week. It will have a movement of 
the bowels every day, soft and yel- 
low in color, without the aid of medi- 
cine or other help. It will be happy 
and contented. It will cut its first 
tooth at about the sixth month; sit 
up without aid at the seventh or 
eighth month; creep at the ninth or 
tenth month; walk at from the 
twelfth to the fourteenth month, and 
talk at about the fifteenth month of 
age. 

To keep a baby well you must 
satisfy its needs in respect of the 
following essentials, namely: food, 
clothing, fresh air, bathing (with 
sanitary cleanliness of both the baby's 
body and clothing), sleep at night 
and naps in the daytime with all the 
rest and quiet possible. The follow- 
ing simple rules sum up a world of 
practical wisdom on this subject. 



610 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Give the baby pure outdoor air 
both night and day. Give it no food 
but mother's milk or milk or food 
from a clean bottle as directed by 
the physician. Let the baby alone 
when not feeding or bathing it. 
Whenever it cries or is fretful, don't 
offer it food, but give it water. Be 
sure that it gets sleep and at least 
two naps during the day. Don't 
wake the baby to feed it. Don't put 
too much clothing on it. Bathe it 
in a tub every day. 

Why Babies Cry. — Because they 
are tired of lying on one side and 
are unable to turn over. Turn a 
baby once in a while. Because their 
diapers are wet or soiled and there- 
fore uncomfortable. Because their 
hands or feet are cold. Because they 
are thirsty. Babies must have water 
(boiled and cooled, but not iced) to 
drink. Because they are too warm 
(sweating) and possibly irritated by 
" prickly heat." Because they are 
sleepy and wish to lie down and be 
let alone. Because the air of the 
room is foul and smelly. Babies re- 
quire lots of fresh air. Because their 
clothes are too tight, or perhaps a 
pin is sticking into them. Because 
crying is the only way they have to 
tell you something is wrong with 
them. 

Of course babies cry when in pain 
from colic or other cause, but you 
should find out if it is not some of 
the above stated causes before decid- 
ing that it is pain which is causing 
the crying. Above all else, get the 
notion out of your head that every 
time the baby cries it is hungry. If 
you are sure that none of the things 
spoken of above are the cause of the 
crying, then the most probable cause 
is intestinal indigestion and the 
quickest way to relieve it is by an 
enema of salt solution (a level tea- 
spoonful of salt in a pint of warm 
water). 

Children often cry when put down 
to sleep. If they are let alone they 
will soon stop crying and go to sleep. 
Don't get nervous about it. Don't 
fear that the crying child will rup- 
ture itself. Crying is one way in 
which children learn to develop their 
lungs. If children were let alone 



and allowed to have their cry out, 
instead of being tossed and petted 
and hushed, they would be far better 
for it. 

Many babies suffer because they 
are used to amuse older people and 
are tossed about and excited when 
they should be resting or sleeping. 
Try to have people leave the baby 
alone. Think how tired and irritable 
you get yourself on a hot day and 
shield the baby as much as possible 
from excitement and " attention." 

Kissing. — There are many serious 
objections to babies being kissed by 
other children and by older people. 
Tuberculosis, diphtheria, and other 
dangerous diseases may be communi- 
cated in this way. 

GENERAL RULES 

Clothing. — The clothing of infants 
should be simple, warm, light in 
weight and not too tight fitting. For 
the first four or five months provide 
an abdominal band of thin, soft 
wool or flannel about six inches wide 
and twenty inches long. This will 
prevent serious effects from sudden 
changes of temperature. It should 
be only wide enough to cover the 
belly and should be wound two or 
three times around the body, accord- 
ing to the season of the year. This 
bellyband, or pinning blanket, should 
be wound smooth and free from 
creases or folds, and fastened with 
safety pins, or preferably with a few 
stitches of soft darning cotton. It 
must not be pinned so tightly as to 
interfere with the movements of the 
child's bowels or it will tend to cause 
diarrhoea. Nor should it be wide 
enough to impede the free movement 
of the legs, else it will prevent 
proper exercise and make the child 
fretful. All the baby's clothing 
should at all times be loose enough 
to allow it to breathe and move its 
limbs easilj' and to admit of the free 
circulation of blood. Never use cloth- 
ing with tight waistbands. Skirts 
should be supported from the shoul- 
ders by straps. Never, for appear- 
ance sake, put starched, stiff or un- 
comfortable clothing on a baby. 

Infants are very susceptible to 



1 



THE CARE OF BABIES 



611 



changes of temperature. The cloth- 
ing should be modified with each 
change in the weather. Either over- 
heating or sudden chill tends to pro- 
duce stomach or intestinal complaints. 
Healthy infants are, however, warm 
blooded and need less covering than 
adults, especially in hot weather. 
Cool outdoor air will not harm them 
even in winter or in cold climates, 
if they are well wrapped up, pro- 
tected from changes of temperature 
and kept out of drafts. 

More babies are made sick by being 
wrapped up too warmly, especially in 
summer or in hot climates, than by 
taking cold. Babies feel the heat 
more than grown folks. Keep them 
cool in summer. They will not take 
cold. All through the hot season 
dress the child very lightly and keep 
it cool. Unless the baby is very deli- 
cate, limit its clothing in hot weather 
to a shirt, petticoat, cotton dress, 
narrow bellyband of thin wool, and 
the diaper. During the height of 
summer one thin piece, as a loose 
muslin slip or gauze shirt, is enough 
both day and night, in addition to a 
narrow bellyband of light wool and 
a diaper. On very hot days take off 
all the clothing but the diaper, un- 
less the baby is under four months 
old, or is delicate or colicky, in which 
case the bellyband should be 
worn. 

A baby with fever should never be 
wrapped up. It will not take cold. 
Remove nearly all the clothing and 
give a sponge bath every two or 
three hours. If the baby breaks out 
with nettle rash or " prickly heat " 
add to the basin of water a teaspoon- 
ful of baking soda or a tablespoon- 
ful of vinegar. After bathing with 
this mixture leave a slight moisture 
on the skin. Remove all clothing ex- 
cept the diaper and lay the baby in 
a cool place, but not in a draft. 
Keep the feet warm, the head cool. 
It is a mistake to suppose that ba- 
bies must be kept wrapped up in 
flannel at all seasons of the year. 

The Diapers. — Use great care in 
the selection of the baby's diapers at 
all times, and especially during the 
summer months when it is so easy 
to overheat and irritate the bladder 



and the bowels. Make the diapers of 
the softest cotton cloth. Change 
them promptly when wet or soiled 
and keep them in a bucket or other 
receptacle containing water in which 
baking soda has been dissolved in 
the proportion of about one teaspoon- 
ful to the pint. Cover tightly to pre- 
vent odors and to exclude flies. A 
big lard pail or tin cracker box is 
suitable. Remember that summer 
diarrhoea and cholera infantum are 
infectious diseases and contagion 
may be carried to other children or 
grown persons by flies. Wash soiled 
diapers as soon as possible with pure 
refined soap or, preferably, in hot 
soda water. Rinse, air and dry thor- 
oughly before using again. Never 
dry and use a diaper a second time 
before washing it. Boil all diapers 
at least once a week. Diapers fresh- 
ly washed should never be put on a 
child suffering from diarrhoea. If 
there are no more at hand which have 
been washed several days previous, 
go through the house and gather all 
the clean soft pieces of old linen and 
muslin you can find. Cut these into 
proper shape for temporary use. If 
the supply is still insufficient, borrow 
from some one else. In summer, 
diarrhoea diapers must never be used 
until they have been exposed several 
days to sunlight and fresh air to kill 
the germs which they contain. 

After every movement of the 
bowels change the diaper promptly. 
Babies often get sick from being left 
with soiled diapers on. Wash the 
baby well and pay especial attention 
to the creases in the flesh. The baby 
may become sore and chafed because 
it is not well washed, or because 
baby powder is put on when it is 
still dirty, or because the diapers are 
not washed out but only dried and 
used again. If the baby is chafed 
apply to the irritated surfaces a little 
zinc oxide ointment, sweet oil or olive 
oil instead of powder. 

Clothing worn during the day 
which is to be worn again should be 
hung up to air, preferably out of 
doors, weather permitting. Garments 
worn at night should be hung up to 
air during the day. Both the baby 
and its clothng should be kept at 



612 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Sj 



all times clean, sweet and free from 
odor. 

Bathing. — Give the baby a tub 
bath every morning, preferably at a 
certain regular hour. A clean baby 
is happier and healthier than a dirty 
baby. A daily bath helps the baby 
to stand heat and, in hot weather, 
it may be Avell to bathe the baby 
twice or three times a day. Never 
bathe within an hour after feeding. 
A good plan is to give the baby its 
bath, then its bottle and then a nap. 
The first full bath should not be 
given for a week or ten days after 
birth. The water should not be be- 
low blood heat, which is between 
98° and 99°. Or, better, make the 
water one or two degrees warmer 
than your own or the baby's tem- 
perature. If the infant is vigorous, 
the temperature may gradually be 
reduced to 95° at six months, to 90° 
at one year of age, and to 80° at 
the age of two and a half years. 

Every mother should have a clini- 
cal thermometer. This can be ob- 
tained at any drug store. If you 
have one, use it when preparing the 
baby's bath. If not, test the water 
by putting your face in it. Never 
test it by the arm or hand. Until 
the infant is able to sit up unsup- 
ported, it should have only a sponge 
bath, but do not use a sponge. They 
cannot be kept clean. Use instead 
pieces of soft old toweling, or cheese 
cloth which can be balled up in the 
hand. As soon as the baby can sit 
up, obtain a small bath tub or use 
a wash tub. If the water is neither 
too cold nor too warm, the child 
will always enjoy its bath. The rea- 
son that some children do not like 
the bath is because they have been 
put into water that is too hot or 
too cold. Remember that an infant 
does not react quickly from a cold 
bath and is depressed or injured by 
water that seems only slightly cool 
to an adult. Children's skin is very 
sensitive and the baby must not be 
permitted to take cold. It should 
be bathed in a room warmed to a 
temperature of at least 75° and care- 
fully guarded against drafts. 

A cold bath indoors or outdoor 
fresh water or surf bathing, should 



not be permitted under three years. 
A child of two years may be allowed 
to run about on the sand with its 
bare feet and occasionally step in 
the water, but much harm has been 
done by immersing young babies in 
cold water. It is a good plan to 
sponge the neck and feet of a baby 
over twelve months old with cold 
water at night and follow with brisk 
rubbing. This in many cases will 
prevent its taking cold. 

Take good care of the baby's skin. 
If it is irritated the baby will be un- 
comfortable, and will tend to become 
fretful and unhealthy. Buy only the 
purest kind of soap for the baby's 
bath and use it sparingly. The green 
Castile Zanti soap is the best and 
can be procured through your drug- 
gist. If this is not available, white 
castile soap is the next choice. Do 
not use soap if the skin is irritated 
or raw. Place a cheese cloth bag 
containing a teacupful of bran in 
the baby's bath and squeeze it un- 
til the water becomes slightly 
milky. 

On very warm days, sponge the 
baby two to four times wth luke- 
warm water in which dissolve a little 
salt in the proportion of a teaspoon 
to each pint, or use a like amount of 
alcohol (not wood alcohol) instead 
of salt. For nettle rash or " prickly 
heat " bathe the affected skin with 
water containing a teaspoonful of 
baking soda or a tablespoonful of 
vinegar, but remember that rough- 
ened or inflamed skin may be the 
sign of infectious disease. If it 
does not yield to this treatment con- 
sult your physician. 

If the baby has fever, sponge it 
in cool vinegar water every two or 
three hours and place cool wet cloths 
on its head. Sponge the baby when- 
ever the diapers are changed. Take 
especial care to cleanse the creases 
of the body, particularly after move- 
ments of the bowels. Dry the skin 
thoroughly after sponging and if 
talcum jjowder is used, buy only the 
unscented. 

Don't let the baby crawl on a dirty 
floor where it may pick up the germs 
of tuberculosis or other disease and 
transmit them to its mouth. Keep 



THE CARE OF BABIES 



613 



the floor clean and wash the baby's 
hands after crawling. 

Care of the Mouth. — Wash out 
the mouth at least twice a day with 
a soft clean cloth wet in water con- 
taining a teaspoonful of borax or 
baking soda to the pint, but never 
put your fingers in the baby's mouth 
without first washing them. Don't 
let the baby put dogs or cats close to 
its mouth. 

Fresh Air. — Fresh air is as im- 
portant to the baby's health as fresh 
food. Children, like growing plants, 
thrive best in the open air. Keep 
the baby in the largest, coolest, best 
ventilated room you have. Screen 
the windows and doors against flies 
and destroy those that get in. Also 
protect the baby from flies, mos- 
quitoes and other insects by screens 
and mosquito netting. Insects often 
carry the germs of malaria, typhoid 
and other contagious diseases. Keep 
the room clean and free from gar- 
bage, soiled clothes and rubbi.sh. 
Even in winter and in cold climates, 
the airing of the baby's room may be 
begun when he is not more than a 
month old. Thereafter the windows 
may be kept open for a gradually 
lengthened period of time from a 
few minutes to an hour or several 
hours at a time depending on the 
weather. Protect the baby when 
thus exposed to the fresh air by put- 
ting on his bonnet and coat the same 
as for an airing out of doors. If 
thus habituated to fresh air the baby 
is much less liable to colds than if 
reared in foul or stagnant air. 

In summer keep as little fire as 
possible. In very hot weather keep 
the doors and windows wide open 
night and day. Always keep one or 
more windows open in the baby's 
sleeping room winter and summer, 
night and da}% and whether the baby 
is sick or well, as soon as it has 
been properly accustomed to fresh 
air. Some ignorant persons have a 
superstition that "night air" is in- 
jurious to health. Night air is the 
only kind of air there is at night and 
fresh outdoor air is far more whole- 
some than that which has been shut 
up in the house and breathed over 
and over again. In summer sleep 



out of doors with the baby if you 
can. 

Keep the baby out of the kitchen 
or other overheated rooms, especially 
if you are cooking or wasliing. Take 
it out of doors in the early morning 
when the air is free from dust, and 
if the weather is good keep it out of 
doors, if you can, all day. Avoid 
the sun on hot days. Keep on the 
shady side of the street, under* the 
trees, or in some shady place. Walk 
and move around slowly. Have a 
basket for the baby to sleep in, which 
you can hang up outdoors in some 
shady place away from dust and 
sudden winds. But when you place 
the baby in the shade be very care- 
ful to alter its position as the sim 
moves around. Be careful not to 
let the sun shine on the baby's eyes. 
Its sight may be injured if it is 
left staring up into the hot sun. 
During the fly season see that the 
baby is covered with a suitable net. 
Keep it away from crowds and 
crowded places. Babies are very sus- 
ceptible to the germs of contagious 
diseases. 

A trip to the country for city ba- 
bies, or any change to a higher alt- 
tude or cooler climate, may save the 
baby's life if summer complaint or 
diarrhoea should set in during the 
heat of midsummer. Choose pre- 
ferably some place near a large body 
of water. An ideal spot is a heavy 
wooded region on the banks of a 
lake or bay. Too much sunshine is 
harmful — natural shade is necessary 
to health and comfort. Even a few 
hours in the park every day or two 
may save the life of a baljy living 
in a crowded city. When traveling 
with a sick baby, carry sufficient food 
— cow's milk, condensed milk or other 
manufactured foods — to last the 
baby during the trip. Also carry a 
supply of pure or boiled water for 
the baby to drink and for use in 
mixing its food. There is a travel- 
ing basket on the market lined with 
metal and felt, or mineral wool, 
which contains chambers for ice and 
milk bottles. In this, milk can be 
kept the same as in a refrigerator. 
This ba.sket will also carry an alco- 
hol stove and su))ply of alcohol, ex-

tra nipples, brushes and other acces- 
sories to the nursing bottle. 

Sleep and Rest. — Under no circum- 
stances should a baby sleep with its 
mother, nurse or any other person. 
Very young babies have often been 
smothered by their mothers over- 
lying them in sleep. There is also a 
temptation to frequent nursing at 
night which is harmful to both the 
baby and mother. If there is no 
crib, a bed for the baby may be 
made up on a couple of chairs at 
the mother's bedside. The baby will 
be much more comfortable in such 
a bed and will neither disturb others 
nor be disturbed. The backs of the 
chairs will keep the baby from fall- 
ing. A morris chair makes a good 
substitute for an infant's crib and 
can be utilized during the daytime. 
Lay the back down flat with some- 
thing under it for a support and use 
the cushions as a mattress. 

The Baby's Bed. — The best kind 
of a bed for a baby is a mattress 
made of excelsior covered with 
cheese cloth. A good quality of ex- 
celsior may be obtained at any fur- 
niture store or factory for a few 
cents, and cheese cloth may be found 
in any dry goods store at three or 
four cents a yard. Such a bed is al- 
ways cool, clean and comfortable. It 
helps the child to keep strong and 
well and free from colds and coughs. 
Should it become soiled, the excel- 
sior can be removed, the cover 
washed and another cover stuffed 
with excelsior substituted. This bed 
is highly recommended for sick chil- 
dren, especially in summer months. 
If an ordinary mattress is used it 
should be firm and liard. 

Never put a baby to sleep on a 
feather pillow or lay it on a rubber 
cloth or oil cloth u])on a bed. Such 
beds overheat the baby's back and 
head, so that when taken up it is 
wet with sweat, and very apt to take 
cold. Never use feather pillows. 
Provide a crib for the baby and let 
it sleep alone at night. Keep the 
bed and bed clothes scrupulously 
clean. Change them promptly if they 
become soiled. Cover the bed or crib 
with mosquito netting. Flies not 
only make the baby restless, but may 



communicate the germs of malaria, 
ty]>hoid, or other contagious dis- 
eases. 

Sleep and Naps. — Let the baby 
sleep all it will. Authorities differ 
as to whether or not a well child 
should be awakened from its nap to 
be fed at its regular feeding time. 
The prevailing opinion seems to be 
that the child should be allowed to 
awaken naturally, but that, if put 
down for its naps at regular hours 
and not handled or disturbed, it will 
sleep about the same length of time 
each day and can thus be trained in 
regular habits of sleep which will not 
interfere with the regularity of its 
feedings or turn night into day. Ba- 
bies under three years of age should 
have regular two-hour naps morning 
and afternoon. Up to six months old 
they should have eighteen hours' sleep 
and thereafter at least twelve hours' 
sleep at night, besides the daily naps. 
Older children should have at least 
one nap during the day. The want 
of sufficient sleep is a very serious 
hindrance to the child's growth and 
development. Get the baby into the 
habit of going to sleep without being 
held or rocked. This is much better 
for the baby and saves time for the 
mother or other members of the fam- 
ily. Lay the baby down in a suitable 
place and let it alone. Children 
often cry when put down to sleep. 
If they are let alone and not handled 
or talked to they stop crying 
and go to sleep. Don't fear that 
the baby will rupture itself by 
crying. Don't keep a child at the 
breast or bottle while putting it to 
sleep. 

Handling. — When the baby is 
awake don't get it into the habit of 
being held by its mother or other 
children. Most babies suffer because 
they are used to amuse older people 
and are forced to laugh or are tossed 
about and excited when they need to 
rest or be quiet. Constant holding 
and passing from one arm to the 
other tend to make the baby fret- 
ful, cross and sick. No man or 
woman would like to be held, tossed 
or tumbled around for several hours 
daily by a much larger person. This 
is just what frequently happens to 



THE CARE OF BABIES 



615 



the child. He likes to play by him- 
self. Therefore, let him alone with 
some one to watch him, and don't 
handle him. 

Quieting the Baby. — Never give a 
child soothing sirup to make him 
sleep. Such preparations contain 
some form of opium or other poison- 
ous, habit-forming drugs. Don't let 
it suck a nipple, " comforter " or 
" pacifier." All artificial devices for 
quieting babies are harmful. Paci- 
fiers often cause thrush or other in- 
fections of the mouth. Their use 
causes a constant flow of saliva 
which interferes with digestion. They 
sometimes cause deformities of the 
mouth and teeth, and may lead to 
the habit of sucking the fingers. 
They are wholly unnecessary and 
their use should be discontinued. 

Standing and Walking. — The free 
use of the muscles is essential to 
health even in early infancy. Do not 
swathe the baby's limbs so closely as 
to prevent their movements. Even in 
the early months it is a good plan, 
under proper conditions of warmth, 
to take off babies' outer wraps and let 
them kick. It is good for them. Do 
not encourage the baby to stand or 
try to teach it to walk. It will walk 
when it gets ready. The bones of an 
infant are plastic and if its weight 
is thrown upon them too soon there 
will be danger of bow-legs or other 
deformities. It is a mistake to en- 
courage a child to stand or walk too 
early. Few babies can walk at twelve 
months and none should be allowed to 
do so. 

BREAST FEEDING 

If you love your baby nurse it. Its 
chance for life will be nearly ten 
times greater than the chance of the 
bottle-fed baby. Nursing will also 
lay the foundations of a good con- 
stitution with which to resist the at- 
tacks of summer complaint, consump- 
tion, convulsions and rickets (bow- 
legs), and the contagious diseases of 
infancy. Children never fully re- 
cover from the effects of a lack of 
proper nourishment during the first 
few months of life. The chief ad- 
vantage of breast feeding over bottle 



feeding is that breast milk is the 
cleanest milk obtainable. Taken di- 
rectly from the maternal breast to 
the stomach of the infant the natural 
food of infancy is not exposed to 
anything that might contaminate or 
pollute it. Careful observation shows 
that it is not the hot weather itself 
that causes the high mortality among 
infants in summer, for breast-fed 
babies do not die excessively in hot 
weather. The difference is due to the 
freedom of breast milk from the 
micro-organisms, or germs in dirty 
cow's milk, which cause intestinal dis- 
ease. Even the difference in the 
composition of breast milk and bot- 
tle milk seems to play a very minor 
role in the high summer death rate, 
because in the winter there is very 
little difference in the death rate as 
between breast-fed and bottle-fed ba- 
bies. 

There is no perfect substitute for 
mother's milk. The milk of the cow, 
goat, and other animals, condensed 
milk, and the artificial manufactured 
foods so widely advertised, are un- 
natural and unsatisfactory make- 
shifts. Even the milk of the wet 
nurse will not agree with the infant 
as well as that of its mother. All of 
these substitutes have been often an- 
alyzed and the difference between 
them and the natural food of infancy 
is clearly understod. The milk of 
the she ass and the mare most closely 
resemble that of women through their 
percentage of casein. Cow's milk 
comes next. Goat's milk holds only 
the fourth place. It has no advan- 
tage over cow's milk. Condensed 
milk contains too much sugar, and 
not enough fat. None of the manu- 
factured foods most commonly used 
contain sufficient fat; some contain 
too much starch, others too much 
sugar. At times some of these sub- 
stitutes may be used to advantage, 
but none of them can take the place 
of mother's milk, nor be safely used 
alone. 

Almost every mother can nurse her 
baby if she will. Even though there 
is but little milk at first, don't be- 
come discouraged; be patient and try, 
try again. There are very few moth- 
ers whose breast will not give suf- 



616 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



flcient milk if they will encourage the 
baby to suck. This keep the milk 
flowing and increases the flow. Even 
though you feel weak, you can nurse 
the baby without danger to yourself. 
Only a few serious diseases forbid 
nursing. If you are in doubt, con- 
sult your doctor. His advice is bet- 
ter than that of your neighbors or 
relatives. 

Even though the breast milk is 
scanty, you should cherish it as you 
value your baby's life and health. A 
single swallow of such food is better 
than nothing. In such a case do not 
alternate the breast with the bottle 
feeding. This will tend to let the 
breasts dry up. Nurse regularly to 
the extent of the supply, and if re- 
quired, immediately make up the 
shortage at each feeding from the 
bottle. 

Care of the Nursing Mother. — A 
nursing mother must keep herself 
well in order to keep her baby well. 
Breast-fed babies often vomit or 
have diarrha?a because the mother is 
sick or tired out, or because the milk 
is poor. Causes which weaken the 
mother and injure her milk are im- 
proper food, irregular meals, exhaus- 
tion from over-work or lack of sleep, 
and too frequent or prolonged nurs- 
ing. Mothers must not overwork, 
worry, or get overheated. They 
should sleep as much as possible, and 
preferably outdoors, or in rooms with 
windows wide open. The above 
causes may render the milk less nu- 
tritious or even dangerous. They act 
especially in hot weather. If you 
feel that you cannot nurse your baby 
or think that you ought not to do so, 
consult your doctor before using any 
kind of artificial food. There are 
cases in which it is better to remove 
the baby from the breast, but the 
dangers are such that the mother 
should not assume this responsibility 
but should be guided by the doctor's 
advice. 

Nursing mothers should therefore 
keep themselves well and their milk 
in good condition, by eating at regu- 
lar hours three plain, well-cooked 
meals a day, consisting of milk, meat, 
vegetables and cereals. They should 
drink freely between meals of pure 



cold water. The notion that large 
quantities of tea, coffee and beer im- 
prove the quality of the mother's 
milk Is a mistake. Beer and tea are 
always harmful and large quantities 
are positively dangerous. Mothers 
should keep their bowels regular. 
Constipation in a nursing mother 
often causes colic in her child. If the 
mother is ill or run down, or the 
baby has diarrhoea and vomiting, she 
should consult a doctor at once, and 
before giving the baby other foods or 
bottle feeding. 

Diet of the Nursing Mother. — 
Both the quantity and the quality of 
the mother's milk may be lmj)roved 
by improving her health and by modi- 
fication of her diet. 

The first rule of a good diet for 
the nursing mother is that it must 
agree with her and keep her in a 
good state of health. Hence a diet 
adopted to increase the quantity or 
quality of the milk must not be ad- 
hered to unless it proves wholesome 
to the mother. Some foods, as toma- 
toes, strawberries and lettuce, which 
may be eaten by some nursing moth- 
ers without affecting their babies, 
cannot be eaten by others. For most 
mothers these fresh foods are of 
great value and may be eaten freely. 
The mother must be in good health 
to produce good milk. 

The quantity of the milk may be 
increased by the use of liquid foods. 
Drink plenty of pure water and good 
rich milk. A quart or more of milk 
a day may often be taken to advan- 
tage. The diet may be varied by the 
use of tea, coffee (taken sparingly), 
cocoa and soup, in addition to milk. 
Take care not to brew tea and coffee 
long enough to extract from them the 
tannin, caffeln and other harmful 
substances they contain. Never boll 
tea or put the teapot over the fire. 
Simply put in the tea and i>our boil- 
ing water over it. Pour as soon as 
it is strong enough, which will be In 
about three minutes. Do not allow 
coffee to boil. Use preferably a cof- 
fee percolator and remove from the 
fire as soon as it begins to boil. 
Drink freely of pure water, but avoid 
all sour, salt or highly spiced foods 
and alcoholic drinks of all kinds. 



THE CARE OF BABIES 



617 



Also avoid saline purgatives (salts) 
— they are highly injurious. 

auality of Mother's Milk.— If the 
breast milk is plentiful and of good 
quality, yet fails to nourish the in- 
fant, a change of the mother's diet 
and habits will be found to give ex- 
cellent results. The richness of the 
milk may be increased by eating 
plenty of meat, eggs, animal broths, 
and other animal foods; or decreased 
by omitting or decreasing these foods 
and by eating freely of fruits and 
cereals. If the infant does not in- 
crease in weight, the use of fats and 
oils by the mother will soon cause 
improvement. 

Roth's Rules for Influencing 
Breast Milk. — To increase the total 
quantity, increase proportionately the 
liquids in the mother's diet and en- 
courage her to believe that she will 
be enabled to nurse her infant; or to 
decrease the quantity, decrease the 
liquids proportionately. 

To increase the total solids, shorten 
the nursing intervals and decrease the 
exercise and the proportion of liquids 
in the mother's diet. To decrease the 
total solids, prolong the nursing in- 
tervals and increase the exercise and 
the proportion of liquid diet. To in- 
crease the fats, increase the propor- 
tion of meat in the diet and of the 
fats which are in a readily digestible 
form. To decrease the fats, decrease 
the proportion of meat and fat in the 
diet. To increase the proteids, de- 
crease the exercise; or to decrease 
the proteids, increase the exercise up 
to the limit of fatigue for the indi- 
vidual. 

When to Nurse. — The mother's 
milk does not always come immedi- 
ately after the birth of the child. 
Sometimes it is unusually late in 
coming. In these cases, the rule 
should be to wait and be sure before 
resorting to bottle feeding. Take the 
advice of the family doctor. This is 
too serious a matter to be settled off- 
hand and without the best advice. 
Sometimes a good flow of milk is not 
established until the fourth, fifth 
or sixth day. Some young mothers 
make the serious mistake of giving 
other food to their babies during this 
time. It may be taken for granted 



that nature's method cannot be im- 
proved upon. The baby will not 
starve. If it is given anything ex- 
cept the mother's milk, it may be 
seriously injured. Put the child to 
the breast every six hours the first 
day, and every four hours the second 
day after birth, or oftener if it fails 
to nurse or obtain nourishment. But 
do not awaken it to nurse. Undis- 
turbed rest is what it needs. In the 
interval between nursings give it a 
clean linen rag moistened with pure, 
boiled water to suck. After the milk 
comes, usually from the third day 
on, the frequency of nursing during 
the first year is shown in the follow- 
ing table from Holt:

After the third day and for the 
next six weeks, nurse the baby every 
two hours during the day time, and 
not more than twice at night, or a 
total of not more than ten nursings 
in the twenty-four hours. The 
healthj^ child will take one or more 
naps each day. It should not be 
awakened for feeding, but aside from 
this should be fed regularly every 
two hours. 

The interval between nursing may 
be increased from the sixth week to 
the third month to two and one-half 
hours with one nursing at night, or a 
total of eight nursings in twenty- 
four hours. The interval may be fur- 
ther increased to three hours during 
the day time with one nursing at night 
from the third to the fifth month. 
From the fifth to the twelfth month 
the times of feeding remain the same, 
but the night feeding should be dis- 
continued. If the child wakes up in 
the night, give it a drink of cooled 
boiled water, or thin barley water 
without milk. It needs nothing more. 
After a short time, if it is well, it 
will sleep through the night,

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



It is easy to get the baby into good 
habits, and hard to get it out of bad 
habits. By adopting regular habits 
of nursing, the mother is given more 
freedom and more rest and is in bet- 
ter condition to take good care of her 
child. Form the habit of nursing 
your baby by the clock. It will soon 
learn to expect its nursing at the 
proper time, and not at any other 
time. It is a good plan to write on 
a slip of paper a memorandum of 
the hours for nursing with the date 
on which the hours are to be changed 
to longer intervals, and also which 
breast is to be used at each nursing. 
It is much better to use but one 
breast at each feeding alternating, 
than to let the baby nurse at both 
breasts at each feeding. Such a 
memorandum during the first six 
weeks would read: 

Right, 5 A. M. ; Left, 7 a. m. ; Right, 
9 A. M. ; Left, 11 a. m. ; Right, 1 p. m. ; 
Left, 3 P.M.; Right, 5 p.m.; Left, 7 
P.M.; Right, 9 p. 31.; Change to 2i 
hours between nursing on (date). 

Do not nurse except at the regular 
intervals. It is a great, but very 
common mistake to put the baby to 
the breast every time it cries. It is 
more likely to be thirsty or suffering 
from over-feeding than to be hungry. 
Give it a drink of water, but do not 
nurse it until the regular time. If 
you nurse oftener, your milk will be- 
come unfit. Babies when nursed too 
often or whenever they cry get in- 
digestion and then cry harder from 
pain. If a baby is not sick or un- 
comfortable from heat or from the 
pricking of a pin, it will get no 
harm from crying. Indeed, every 
baby should cry during the day. It 
helps to develoj) its lungs. Crying, 
especially during the first few days 
of life is perfectly natural, and often 
beneficial. It does not necessarily in- 
dicate illness or hunger at any time, 
and food or medicine should not be 
given merely because the child cries. 

The nursing should not last more 
than twenty minutes. Never let the 
baby go to sleep with the nipple in 
its mouth. Never nurse the baby 
when you are very tired or very much 
wrought up with grief, anger, or 
other very strong emotion. Your 



milk under such conditions will often 
be unfit for food. It may give the 
baby convulsions. In such cases it 
is often better to draw off the milk 
and give the infant some other food 
until you regain self control. Do 
not take drugs while nursing your 
baby, except by the direction of your 
physician. Opium, senna, rhubarb, 
and some other drugs may affect the 
milk so as to poison the child. 

Care of Nursing Bottles. — If the 
baby must be fed from a bottle abso- 
lute sanitary cleanliness is the price 
of safety. A baby cannot get clean 
milk out of a dirty bottle or through 
a dirty nipple. Sore mouth, colic 
and summer complaint often come 
from improper care of bottles and 
nipples. It is true that some babies 
have lived in filthy surroundings and 
survived dirty food, but it is equally 
true that others have been killed by 
them. The only safe course is to take 
no chances. It is better to be safe 
than to be sorry. 

Clean the nursing bottle immedi- 
ately after each feeding. First rinse 
with clear cold water. Hot water 
changes the casein of milk into an in- 
soluble glue which is very hard to 
wash oft". Stale milk curds sticking 
to the inside of the bottle become 
poisonous after a few hours and may 
contaminate fresh food. After rins- 
ing, put the bottle to soak in soda or 
borax water or soap suds. Finally, 
scrub the inside with a clean wire or 
other bottle brush; rinse with hot wa- 
ter and boil for twenty minutes. 
Turn the bottle upside down in a 
clean dish without wiping, and place 
in a clean place to dry and cool. Or, 
preferably fill the bottle with clean 
boiled water and a little piece of cook- 
ing soda the size of a pea and let the 
water stand in the bottle until the 
next feeding. Never let the bottle 
stand with milk in it. Never try to 
save what is left from one feeding 
until the next. 

Ntirslng Bottles. — Never use square 
or paneled bottles. Sour milk and 
dirt cannot be removed from the cor- 
ners. This filth remaining will after- 
wards contaminate the fresh food. 
Also avoid nursing bottles with tubes 
of either glass or rubber. They may 



THE CARE OF BABIES 



619 



be handy for you, but they are death 
to your baby. Indigestion and bowel 
complaint are the result. Their use 
cannot be too strongly condemned. 
They cannot be properly cleaned and 
milk taken through them, especially 
in hot weather, soon becomes filthy 
and absolutely poisonous to the in- 
fant. Square bottles and nursing 
tubes are baby killers and their sale 
has been forbidden in many states by 
law. Select bottles with round cor- 
ners and with the kind of nipple that 
fits over the neck and can be turned 
and washed both inside and out. Nip- 
ples of black rubber are better than 
those of white or red. 

No person ailing or sick with a 
contagious disease, or who is known 
or suspected of having been exposed 
to such diseases, should be allowed to 
touch or come near the baby's milk 
or other food, or any of the utensils 
in which it is prepared or served. A 
small cluster of bacteria from a con- 
taminated finger may develop to a 
colony of several billions in a bottle 

tof warm milk within a short time. 
Care of Rubber Nipples. — Use the 
kind of nipple which is slipped over 
the neck of the bottle. Have at least 
two nipples, or preferably buy a 
half dozen at a time and keep some 
on hand to replace those that are lost 
or injured. After each feeding, turn 
the nipple inside out, rinse with cold 
water, and scrub with a brush kept 
for that purpose. Wash thoroughly 
with hot water inside and out, and 
drop into a cup containing about a 
teaspoonful of soda or borax to the 
pint of water, until needed for use. 
Boil the nipple at least once daily for 
twenty minutes while the milk bot- 
tles are being boiled. Rinse the nip- 
ple in boiling water before using it. 
Don't put it into your mouth to find 
out whether the milk is warm enough, 
nor let the nurse do so. To test its 
temperature, let a few drops of milk 
fall on your wrist. 

Weaning'. — Ask your doctor how 
long you ought to nurse your baby. 
It will depend partly upon your state 
of health, and partly upon the season 
of the year. Some mothers ought to 
wean their infants at six months, 
others may nurse them a full year. 



The average is about nine or ten 
months. Nursing the child too long 
is an unnecessary drain upon the 
mother. There is also great danger 
of injury to the child. Don't wean 
your baby as long as he is gaining in 
weight, and never do so except by 
the advice of your physician. His 
advice is better than that of your 
neighbors. If the baby remains well 
but stops gaining weight, don't con- 
clude that your milk does not agree 
with it. Consult your physician 
about the use of some artificial food 
to help you out. Wean gradually by 
giving one breast meal less each 
week and teach the baby to drink 
from a cup or bottle. This is better 
for the baby. Sudden weaning is 
apt to cause serious illness. 

With the advice and consent of 
your physician, you may begin dur- 
ing the fifth or sixth month to teach 
the baby to take food and water from 
a bottle. Thus the baby will be fed 
for some time with both breast milk 
and artificial food, and there will be 
time for his stomach to adjust itself 
to the change. This plan will ma- 
terially decrease both the difficulties 
and dangers of weaning. It also 
helps you to extend the period of 
nursing. Every drop of breast milk 
the baby gets adds to his health and 
strength as no other food ever can. 

In changing from breast milk to 
cow's milk, the milk used first should 
be very much diluted and modified 
unless the baby has been given a bot- 
tle in addition to the mother's milk. 
In weaning a six months old baby 
give the milk usually given to an in- 
fant one month old. If the baby is 
ten months old, give the milk usually 
given to a three months old baby. 

Wet Nurses. — A true foster mother 
in good health and spirits and equally 
as devoted to the welfare of the 
child as though it were her own, would 
be the ideal substitute for an in- 
fant deprived of its mother's milk. 
In practice, there are so many objec- 
tions to the employment of the wet 
nurse that this plan is by no means 
as popular as in years past. The 
cost for board and wages is consid- 
erable and the difficulty of finding a 
suitable person is very great. The

mother who yields her natural func- 
tion to another must remember that 
if the nurse is not perfectly healthy 
she may infect the child with disease; 
if careless and ignorant, she may 
cause the death of the child through 
neglect; and if her own baby should 
chance to suffer through her employ- 
ment, she may grieve or become so 
nervously excited as to make her milk 
unwholesome. She may also leave 
at any moment without warning. 
Hence, a wet nurse should never be 
hired unless she is known to be re- 
liable and of good moral character 
and is pronounced by a competent 
physician to be free from disease. 
Inquiries should be made as to the 
circumstances surrounding her own 
child. Reasonable assurance should 
be had that she is likely to be free 
from anxiety or worry. 

The same care should be devoted to 
the nurse's habits of life and diet as 
the nursing mother should exercise in 
her own behalf. As a rule it is nec- 
essary that the nurse should have the 
sort of food and the amount of exer- 
cise to which she has previously been 
accustomed, rather than that she be 
fed upon rich foods and suffered to 
lead a life of idleness. 

ARTIFICIAL FEEDING 

All doctors of experience agree 
that the problem of the artificial 
feeding of infants is one of the most 
serious which they arc called upon to 
face. Some babies have to be put on 
the bottle at birth or during the first 
few weeks or months of life. All 
must be weaned sooner or later. 
Hence, this is a problem which must 
be worked out for every single child. 
There are certain facts and princi- 
ples which every mother should know, 
because they are of equal importance 
in all cases. But every mother should 
clearly understand that no set of 
rules can be laid down which will be 
adapted in all respects to any child. 
Each baby needs a combination suited 
to his digestion. The mixture upon 
which some other baby is thriving 
may be too strong or too weak for 
your baby. The only way to learn 
what food will agree with your baby 



is by experience. The facts and 
princij)les herein stated are condensed 
from the official publications of 
boards of health throughout the 
United States. They may be relied 
upon as the consensus of the best 
medical opinion. But if your baby 
does not thrive upon artificial food 
prepared as here suggested, you 
should consult your family physician 
and be guided by his advice. 

It is much better for her own 
health as well as that of the child 
for the mother to nurse her own 
baby. It is also much easier and 
cheaper. Milk and other artificial 
food is expensive and so is the ice 
to keep it properly. And much time 
and trouble is required for preparing 
the food. Hence it is almost a crim- 
inal folly for a mother to refuse to 
nurse her baby, unless the physician 
advises her that it is unsafe for her 
to do so. Good artificial food is, 
however, better than bad breast feed- 
ing. Sometimes the mother or the 
infant may be actually unable to 
nurse. The milk may continue to 
disagree with the infant; it may be 
insufficient in quantity or deficient in 
quality properly to nourish the child; 
or the health of the infant's mother 
may require weaning. 

If the milk is good in quality, but 
insufficient in quantity, it is far bet- 
ter to continue the breast feeding 
and to give the baby some artificial 
food in addition, to help the mother 
out. Mother's milk is not only the 
most easily digested and the most nu- 
tritious of all baby foods. It con- 
tains a ferment such that a very 
small quantity helps to digest a 
larger quantity of cow's milk. It also 
contains certain antitoxin substances 
which afford a large degree of pro- 
tection against diarrhosal diseases, the 
ordinary infectious diseases, and some 
others. Hence, even if the su])ply of 
breast milk is not sufficient for the 
total nourishment of the child, this 
partial supply is of such great value 
that it should be ke])t up as long as 
possible. 

Even when the mother's milk has 
nearly disa]ipeared it may sometimes 
be brought back. If the inclination 
of the child has not been spoiled by 



THE CARE OF BABIES 



621 



feeding from a cup or spoon it will, 
by regular application to the breast, 
help to stimulate the secretion of 
millc. The flow can also be encour- 
aged by proper attention to the diet. 
But if the mother is suffering from 
disease which impairs the healthful- 
ness of the milk, breast feeding 
must be wholly discontinued and ar- 
tificial food adopted. 

When Not to Nurse. — When the 
mother is consumptive or suffers 
from any other chronic disease or is 
very delicate, nursing may be too se- 
vere a drain upon her and may be 
unwholesome for the child. Nursing 
a consumptive mother is not only 
dangerous to the child; it may hasten 
the progress of the mothei-'s disease 
and make fatal its termination. 
Breast feeding is also out of the 
question when serious com]>lications 
follow the child's birth, such as se- 
vere hemorrhage, childbed fever, 
blood poisoning, kidney disease, or 
when the mother suffers from epi- 
lepsy or St. Vitus Dance, or other 
chronic nervous affliction. 

Contrary to common opinion the 
nursing mother may become preg- 
nant, in which case her baby should 
be promptly weaned. The milk is 
then deficient in quality and to con- 
tinue nursing may work irreparable 
injury to both mother and child. The 
importance of this fact cannot be 
over-estimated, as some mothers from 
a mistaken opinion to the contrary 
nurse their children for several 
months after they should be weaned 
and suffer the most unfortunate con- 
sequences. 

The menstruation of the mother 
does not affect the milk as much as 
usually believed. It may cause slight 
indigestion, but is not sufficient rea- 
son to stop nursing. Extreme sensi- 
tiveness of the breasts to the point of 
intense pain in nursing is not a good 
reason for discontinuing. Persistence 
for a few days will allow nature time 
to effect a cure. 

MILK MODIFICATION 

Cow's milk undiluted and unmodi- 
fied is entirely unfit for infants un- 
der one year old, but when properly 



diluted and mixed it is the best sub- 
stitute for mother's milk. Cow's 
milk must be diluted on account of 
its riclmess in curds. The cheesy 
matter it contains forms large curds 
in the child's stomach which are 
harder to digest than the smaller 
curds in mother's milk. Hence it is 
necessary to dilute the cow's milk, 
both to lessen the amount of cheesy 
matter and to break up the curds 
into small particles so that the child 
can digest the milk more easily. 
When diluted, however, it contains 
too little fats and sugar. Hence 
after dilution, it is necessary to add 
cream and sugar to the milk. This 
process imitates the milk of the 
mother as nearly as can be done. It 
is commonly known as milk modifica- 
tion. 31 ilk so treated is called modi- 
fied milk. This is now accepted by 
all authorities as the best food for 
the infant deprived of breast milk. 
Cow's milk can be diluted either by 
water, by decoctions of cereals such 
as barley or oatmeal, or, toward the 
end of the first year, by beef or mut- 
ton broth. Both oatmeal and beef 
broth have a tendency to loosen the 
bowels. Changes have to be made 
from time to time to suit the in- 
fant's digestion. Your physician will 
advise you as to how this can be 
done. 

Good cow's milk contains four 
per cent of butter fat and may be 
called 4 per cent milk. After stand- 
ing until the cream rises to the top, 
the upper third of a bottle of good 
milk contains ten per cent of butter 
fat. This is called ten per cent milk, 
or cream. The upper half contains 
seven per cent of butter fat and is 
known as 7 per cent milk. Always 
buy whole milk, i. e., 4 per cent milk, 
never skimmed milk. 

Materials Required for Milk Mix- 
ing. — It is good economy to equip 
yourself at the outset witli a full set 
of proper utensils for mixing the 
baby's milk. The best are none too 
good. The whole cost will hardly 
equal the doctor's fees which may re- 
sult from a single illness due to im- 
proper feeding. You will require an 
eight-ounce glass graduate, a glass 
funnel, a cream dipper, a dozen nurs- 



622 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



ing bottles, a half dozen black rubber 
nipples, and three bottle brushes for 
washing out the bottles. If you buy 
milk in bottles and measure it in a 
glass graduate you will not need to 
use pitchers, cups, or other measures. 
But whatever utensils you do use for 
mixing the baby's food should be 
kept by themselves, washed separate- 
ly, boiled and drained without wip- 
ing, and not put into the dish water 
or wiped with a dish towel in the 
ordinary way. 

The Materna Measure. — This is a 
sixteen-ounce measure with six panel 





(a) Best style of nursing bottle; (b) 
materna measure. 

sides. It affords a simple means of 
milk mixing in the home. On each 
side is marked the exact amount of 
sugar, lime water, water, milk and 
cream to be usel in feeding. The 
six panels are labeled to measure the 
food suitable to as many ages of in- 
fancy. If your druggist does not 
carry this measure in stock ask him 
to order one for you. It will help 
you to avoid making mistakes. 

All utensils used in preparing baby 
food should be of glass, china, porce- 
lain or granite-ironware. These will 
not rust nor present crevices for the 
accumulation of dirt. Never use ves- 
sels or utensils which are cracked or 



have rough edges or surfaces. Se- 
lect nursing bottles with round bot- 
toms and free from angles. The best 
bottles are marked with a scale of 
ounces so that the exact amount 
given may be measured at each feed- 
ing. It is advisable to purchase a 
dozen bottles because it is much more 
convenient to mix in the morning 
the food for the entire day. Put 
enough for each feeding in a sepa- 
rate bottle and then place the bottles 
on ice. Ten feedings will be re- 
quired for small infants and it is 
well to have extra bottles on hand in 
case of breakage. Fewer bottles may 
be used, but no mother should at- 
tempt to get along with less than 
two. It is better to have plenty of 
bottles so that the same bottles will 
not have to be used too frequently. 

MATERIALS FOR MILE MODIFI- 
CATION 

Water. — The purity of water with 
which infants' food is diluted is 
equally as important as the purity 
of the milk. The benefits of clean 
milk are entirely lost if it is diluted 
with dirty water. Pure spring water, 
which can be purchased in bottles in 
many localities, is to be preferred for 
diluting infants' food, but if it is 
necessary to use water from cisterns, 
wells, or streams of doubtful purity, 
boil the water for half an hour and 
store it in clean glass bottles stop- 
pered with cotton wool or antiseptic 
gauze. Do not allow it to stand over 
six hours. 

Lime Water. — Lime water is used 
to overcome the acidity of cow's milk 
and to lessen the consistency of the 
curd. There are some infants with 
whom it does not agree, and if used 
too freely it may cause consti]iation. 
Vichy water is a good substitute for 
lime water and should be used if the 
latter does not agree. Either can be 
obtained from a druggist. But in 
buying material of any kind for in- 
fant feeding, patronize only drug- 
gists in whom you can have con- 
fidence. Some unscrupulous drug- 
gists sell ordinary unfiltered tap 
water for lime water. 

Sugar. — Sugar is not added to 



THE CARE OF BABIES 



623 



cow's milk to sweeten it and make it 
more palatable, but to make it con- 
form as nearly as possible to moth- 
er's milk. Milk sugar is best if you 
can get a pure article from a reliable 
druggist. But milk sugar often con- 
tains impurities. Hence, unless you 
are very sure of the reliability of 
your dealer, use cane sugar; this is 
rarely adulterated or impure. Loaf 
sugar is the purest form of sugar 
and among the purest of all foods. 
Use only half the quantity of cane 
sugar that you would of milk sugar. 

Barley Water. — This is often used 
in diluting milk for infant feeding 
to make the curds of milk more eas- 
ily digestible. Barley flour * is pref- 
erable to pearl barley. To make 
barley water use two tablespoonfuls 
of barley flour or meal, and a small 
pinch of salt, to a quart of cold 
the water, stir and boil fifteen to 
water. First stir the barley flour 
with a little of the water into a thin 
paste. Then add the remainder of 
the water, stir and boil fifteen to 
twenty minutes. If pearl barley is 
used it must be thoroughly cooked. 
Place two tablespoonfuls in one quart 
of water and boil from two to three 
hours. Add more water from time to 
time so that the quantity in the end 
will be one quart. Strain through a 
clean piece of cheese cloth sterilized 
by baking in a hot oven. Barley 
water should not be kept from day 
to day, but should be made fresh 
every morning. 

A prominent physician of northern 
Illinois, who has been practicing for 
thirty-two )'ears, says: "My food for 
babies is invariably one heaping ta- 
blespoonful of pearl (store) barley, 
ground in a coffee-mill, and boiled 
in one quart of water, down to a 
pint. Strain, add the same quantity 
of milk, and let the baby have it. 
Hundreds of mothers have used this 
preparation on my direction, and the 
result has been healthy, growing, fat 
babies. I think that Professor Ja- 
coby recommended this many years 

* Robinson's patent barley or the pre- 
pared barley of the Health Food Com- 
pany are standard preparations of barley 
flour .ind can be obtained at almost any 
drug store. 



ago. At any rate I always use it, 
and with constant success." 

Oatmeal Water. — This is used in 
the same way as barley water, espe- 
cially if a laxative effect is desired. 
To make it, stir two tablespoonfuls 
of oatmeal with a pinch of salt in a 
quart of boiling water. Cover and 
let simmer for two or three hours. 
Replace the water as it evaporates 
so that there will be a quart when 
done. Strain the same as for barley 
water and make fresh every day. 

Or, for oatmeal or rice water, put 
three tablespoonfuls of oatmeal 
(H-0) or rice into a quart of water. 
Soak three hours or overnight. Then 
boil steadily for two hours keeping 
the quantity up to a quart with more 
water as needed. Add a pinch of 
salt and strain as for barley water. 
Keep in an ice box or other cool 
place and make fresh daily, 

BOTTIE FEEDING 

The best plan is to prepare each 
morning enough food to last for 
twenty-four hours and place the re- 
quired quantity for each nursing in a 
separate nursing bottle. Plug the 
bottles with baked absorbent cotton, 
cotton wool or antiseptic gauze. 

Or, if you do not have enough 
nursing bottles, prepare enough food 
for twenty-four hours and place it in 
a clean, freshly boiled fruit jar with 
a glass clamp top. Do not use the 
screw-top jars. They are not so 
easy to keep clean. Do not use the 
rubber ring, it is hard to keep clean 
and is not necessary. 

Get together all the necessary uten- 
sils, and put them in a saucepan, 
preferably of agate ware. Cover 
them with cold or luke-warm water, 
and bring tliem slowly to a boil. 
Clear off a table top to work on and 
cover it with a freshly laundered 
towel or other clean cloth. See that 
everything that comes in contact with 
the milk is absolutely clean. Wash 
your hands with soap' and water and 
scrub them with a stiff brush with 
especial attention to the finger nails. 
Put the water to be used in mixing 
the food on the fire in a covered 
saucepan. Bring it to a boil and 



624 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



keep it, until ready for use, in the 
same vessel in which it was boiled. 
Now mix tlie food exactly as the doc- 
tor directs, or in accordance with the 
formula you have adopted. Always 
mix it exactly the same way. As 
soon as the food has been placed In 
nursing bottles or fruit jar, and stop- 
pered properly, ])ut these on ice or 
in the coolest place you can find. 
Work quickly and do not let the milk 
or i^repared food stand in a warm 
room any longer than is necessary. 

Or, if the milk is not perfectly 
fresh, or has not been freshly pas- 
teurized, it may be pasteurized after 
it has been prepared and placed in 
the nursing bottles. This is perhaps 
the safest course, as it avoids all pos- 
sibility of contamination from the 
time the food is prepared until it Is 
fed. After the nursing bottles are 
filled stand them up on a plate in 
the bottom of a saucepan filled with 
luke-warm water up to within two or 
three inches of the tops of the bot- 
tles. Bring the water slowly to a 
boil. Then remove the saucepan from 
the fire and let the bottles stand in 
the hot water for fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Now cool the water sur- 
rounding the bottles by pouring in 
cold water. But take care not to cool 
the bottles so quickly as to crack 
them. As soon as they are cold 
enough to handle, plug with cotton 
stoppers and put them on the ice. 

Or, if you have no ice, springhouse 
or other means of keeping milk cool, 
especially in summer w^eather, it is 
better to sterilize the milk absolutely 
by leaving the saucepan on the fire 
and keeping the water just at the 
boiling point for 20 minutes. Then 
chill thoroughly with cold water. 
Plug with cotton and keep as cool as 
you can. Such millc is not as whole- 
some as pasteurized or fresh milk 
would be if kept on ice, but it con- 
tains no living germs and is therefore 
safer than unsterilized milk which 
cannot be kept cool ajt 40 degrees F. 
or under. 

Feeding the Baby. — Keep the food 
on ice until ready for use and heat 
it when the baby needs it. Never 
let the bottle stand in a warm room 
with milk in it. Be sure not to heat 



a bottle when you go to bed and 
keep it in bed until nursing time, 
because you do not want to go to the 
ice box for it. This is certain to 
make the baby sick. Do not attempt 
to keep milk at a luke-warm tem- 
perature at night or any other time 
in a thermos bottle or by any other 
arrangement. Sucli a device simply 
acts as an incubator for germs which, 
at this temperature, quickly grow to 
enormous numbers and render the 
milk dangerous. 

Place the nursing bottle in hot 
water when needed and warm the 
food to about body heat. Do not 
give the baby cold milk. Do not give 
the baby hot milk. Make the tem- 
perature just right. Wash your 
hands in soap and water before ad- 
justing the nip])le. Never put the 
nipple in your own mouth to find out 
whether the milk is warm enough. 
Try it on your wrist. Taste a little 
from a spoon. If the milk is not 
sweet do not give it to the baby. 
Shake the bottle before using it. 

Don't feed a baby under six months 
of age from a cup or spoon. Suck- 
ing is the natural way by which a 
baby takes its food. It needs the 
sucking action of the lips, mouth and 
tongue to mix its food with the fluids 
of the mouth, and for the proper 
development of the mouth and teeth. 

How and WTien to Feed. — In feed- 
ing your baby from the bottle follow 
as nearly as you can the same rule 
as feeding from the breast. Write 
down on a slip of paper the hours 
for feeding and feed by the clock at 
regular intervals. Break away from 
night feedings as soon as possible. 
Hold the baby in the same position 
as for nursing at the breast and take 
care to tip the bottle so that the 
neck is always full. The baby should 
not take its food in less than ten 
minutes. If it sucks too rapidly, 
withdraw the bottle occasionally for 
a minute or two, or use a nipple with 
a smaller hole. But do not prolong 
the feeding over fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Never let the child suck the 
empty bottle. Do not let it go to 
sleej) with the nipple in its mouth. If 
you start right and get the baby into 
the habit of nursing at regular inter- 



H 



THE CARE OF BABIES

vals, it will not cry for food at other 
times. If tlie baby cries, look at the 
clock, if not feeding time the trou- 
ble is something else. Infants and 
children are frequently fretful from 
thirst. 

How Much to Feed. — Measure the 
food and give regular amounts at 
each feeding. Never coax the baby 
to take more food than it wants. 
Too much food and too frequent 
feeding does greater harm than too 
little. It over-taxes the digestion and 
leads to stomach and intestinal dis- 
turbances. Regurgitation, or the 
" raising " of the milk after feeding 
indicates over-feeding. Cut down 
the amount and avoid digestive trou- 
bles and diarrhoea. If the baby does 
not take the whole feeding throw it 
away. Do not attempt to save it for 
the next time. 

During days of extreme heat give 
not more than half the usual food 
at each feeding, but give the baby all 
the cold boiled water — not ice water 
— that it craves. At all seasons take 
care to give the baby water at fre- 
quent intervals in sufficient quantities 
to quench its thirst. 

Feeding Problems. — If a bottle-fed 
baby does not thrive the difficulty 
may be that the food is too rich, or 
not rich enough; that the amount fed 
is too much, or too little; or that 
the food spoils before it is fed from 
not being kept clean and cold. The 
food must be kept clean and cold to 
be wholesome at any age. But the 
quality of the food, the amount to 
be given at each feeding, and the fre- 
quency of the feeding nmst be modi- 
fied and adapted to the needs of the 
growing child. It is usual to give 
rules for feeding according to the 
age of the child, but regard must also 
be had to its weight in pounds. 
There is a relation between the 
weight of the baby and size of the 
stomach. Large babies require more 
food than small babies. Most author- 
ities agree that a child should not be 
fed oftener than once in two hours, 
nor more than ten times in each 
twenty-four hours during the first 
few weeks of life, and that the in- 
tervals between feedings should be 
lengthened and the number of feed- 



ings decreased progressively up to 
the end of the first year. The exact 
time to make these changes must be 
determined in each case by the state 
of the baby's health, but the tables on 
the opposite page may be taken as a 
fair general average and will be 
found helpful and suggestive. 

It is best to begin with a weak 
food, as the first milk mixture in the 
accompanying table, for babies from 
birth to three or four months of age. 
The food should be increased gradu- 
ally both in strength and quality. Do 
not increase the quantity more than 
half an ounce at a time. Never in- 
crease both the quantity and the rich- 
ness of the food at the same time. 
Never feed oftener than suggested by 
this table. The child's stomach needs 
some rest. Too rich food or too much 
food at the beginning makes later 
feeding difficult. Over-feeding at 
any time will upset the baby's diges- 
tion and may lead to serious illness. 

Weight and Height. — The age of 
a child alone is not a trustworthy 
guide as to the amount or strength 
of the food which it should have. 
The weight is a much more correct 
index. Weigh the baby every week, 
measure its length (or height) and 
keep a record for future reference. 
Compare this record with the follow- 
ing standard table of the growth and 
development of a normal infant. 

This will show you at once whether 
or not your baby is enjoying a 
normal development. The average 
weight of a child at birth is 7 or 7i 
pounds. During the first week there 
is a loss of a few ounces. There- 
after the normal gain is about six 
ounces a week for the first three 
months, and after that about four 
ounces a week to the end of the first 
year. 

All weights during the first year 
should be taken without any clothing. 
Loss of weight is a danger signal 
which must not be ignored. If your 
baby does not gain weight every 
week consult your doctor and be 
guided by his advice. In doubtful 
cases the weighing should be daily or 
every other day. Use suitable baby 
scales and record the weight for con- 
tinuous reference. The weighing of

children, often brings surprises. 
Loss of weight indicates that the 
milk is insuflScient in quantity or in 
nutritive value, or there are faults of 
digestion and assimilation. Weigh- 
ing of a breast-fed baby just before 
and then just after nursing will 
show the quantity of breast milk ob- 
tained. 

The growth of the child in length 
(or height) is another important aid 
in proper feeding and care of in- 
fants. A normal increase of weight 
does not prove a normal develop- 
ment. An unsuitable food, such as 
condensed milk, may increase the 
weight rapidly enough, or even fatten 
the baby too much, yet the develop- 
ment may be faulty and the degree 
of resistance against disease low. 
Hence both weight and height should 
be taken into consideration.

The character of the stools is a 
most important guide in infant feed- 
ing. Foul smelling, frothy or green- 
ish passages indicate illness and may 
be the forerunner of fatal sickness. 
When the stools are unnatural in 
character or more frequent than four 
a day, a physician should be prompt- 
ly called. 

Milk Mixtures. — The following 
method of preparing the milk mix- 
tures given in the accompanying ta- 
bles is recommended by the Illinois 
State Board of Health as the most 
convenient and satisfactory for those 
using bottled milk. 

Set apart a separate quart of milk 
for the baby and do not shake it or 
pour any milk out of it until after 
the baby's food has been prepared. 
Then what is left may be used by 



others. The top part of the milk, 
the upper third, or upper half, as re- 
quired, may be taken off with a 
spoon by tilting the bottle gently 
without shaking, and dipping from 
it with care not to lose sight of the 
cream line. But it is much better to 
order through your druggist the 
inexpensive little device, known as 
the Chapin cream dipper. It holds 
just one ounce and is convenient both 
for dipping and measuring. If a 
spoon is used, remember that eight 
teaspoons are equivalent to one 
ounce, or four dessertspoons, or two 
tablespoons. 

The 10 per cent milk required by 
the table for milk mixtures from birth 
to three or four months of age, may 
be secured from the upper third of a 
bottle of good 4 per cent milk, or 
by mixing two parts of good whole 
milk with one part of cream. The 
7 per cent milk required by the table 
from the third or fourth month to 
the end of the ninth or tenth month 
may be secured from the upper half 
of a bottle of whole milJi, or by 
mixing three parts of whole milk with 
one part of cream. A pinch of salt 
may be added to the food if desired. 

The milk sugar required should al- 
ways be dissolved in hot water. It 
sours quickly when dissolved, so do 
not prepare more than one day's 
supply at a time. Or, use one-half 
the quantity of pure granulated or, 
preferably, lump sugar. Dissolve in 
hot water and throughly mix. 

The quantity given in the first ta- 
ble is twenty ounces. This is the 
amount that will be used by an aver- 
age baby during the first four weeks 
of life if fed every two hours at the 
rate of about two ounces each feed- 
ing. It is easy to estimate the quan- 
tities required for larger amounts. 
For a twenty-five ounce mixture add 
one-fourth more of each ingredient. 
For a thirty ounce mixture, add one- 
half more of each ingredient. If the 
baby is fed artificially from birth, 
begin with mixture No. 1 in the first 
table. Substitute the succeeding mix- 
tures gradually until the third or 
fourth month. Observe carefully 
how the baby thrives and especially 
any change in weight. After the 



628 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



fourth month the above mixtures are 
not strong enough and those given in 
the second table should be substi- 
tuted. 

When weaning older infants use 
the mixture suited to its age from 
one of the accompanying tables. 

Other Mixtures. — For mothers who 
cannot get milk in bottles and who 
have difficulty in using the mixtures 
given in the above tables, the follow- 
ing are recommended by the Illinois 
State Board of Health. They are 
easily prepared and prove satis- 
factory for most healthy infants. 

For a new-born baby, or one a 
month or two old, take one ounce of 
fresh milk; three ounces of water; 
one ounce of fresh cream, and two 
level teaspoonfuls of milk sugar. 
This makes about five ounces. For 
twenty ounces use four times as much 
of each ingredient. This closely re- 
sembles mother's milk. 

For older babies, take two ounces 
of fresh milk; two ounces of water; 
one ounce of fresh cream; two level 
teaspoonfuls of milk sugar and a 
teaspoonful of lime water. Larger 
quantities may be made by increasing 
the amounts of each ingredient in 
proper proportion. More milk and 
less water will be used as the infant 
increases in age. 

If cream disagrees with the infant 
its use should be stopped tempora- 
rily. The following is a good sub- 
stitute for mother's milk suitable for 
an infant of three months or less: 
Pure milk, cupful; water, two cup- 
fuls; sugar of milk, one heaping ta- 
blespoonful; lime water, one table- 
spoonful. 

The following table contains the 
milk mixtures recommended by the 
Providence (R. I) Health Depart- 
ment: 

For Babies Under One Month. — 
Milk, 5 ounces; lime water, 1 ounce; 
boiled water, 15 ounces; milk sugar, 
IJ tablespoons. 

Dissolve the sugar in the boiling 
water and then add the milk and 
lime water. Keep in a cool place. 
Give the baby -2 ounces every 2 hours 
during the day and once at night. In 
all 10 feedings. Add a little more 
milk to the whole mixture every few 



days and give the baby a little more 
in each bottle. 

One Month to Three Months. — 
Milk, 12 ounces; lime water, 1^ 
ounces; boiled water, 24 ounces; milk 
sugar, li tablespoons. 

Dissolve the sugar in the boiling 
water and then add the milk and lime 
water. Keep in a cool place. Give 
the baby 3^ ounces every 2 hours 
during the day and once at night. 
Ten feedings. Add a little more 
milk to the whole mixture every few 
days and give the baby a little more 
in each bottle. 

Three Months to Six Months. — 
Milk, 1 pint; lime water, 2 ounces; 
boiled water, 1^ pints; milk sugar, 2 
tablespoons. 

Dissolve the sugar in the boiled wa- 
ter and then add the milk and lime 
water. Keep in a cool place. Give 
the bab,y 5 ounces every 2i hours 
during the day and once at night. 
Eight feedings. Add a little more 
milk to the whole mixture every few 
days and give the baby a little more 
in each bottle. 

Six Months to Ten Months. — Milk, 
1* pints; lime water, 2 ounces; 
boiled water, I^ pints; milk sugar, 2 
tablespoons. 

Dissolve the sugar in the boiled 
water and then add the milk and lime 
water. Keep in a cool place. Give 
the baby 6 or 7 ounces or about 1 
cupful every 3 hours during the day. 
Seven feedings. Every few days put 
1 tablespoon less water and 1 table- 
spoon more milk into this mixture. 

Use of Barley Water and Oatmeal 
Water. — Some authorities recommend 
the use of barley water from birth 
in place of the plain water used for 
the dilution of infants' food in the 
above mixtures, and in the same pro- 
portions. Rut others who have made 
a special study of feeding infants, 
think that the use of barley water or 
oatmeal water is not advisable imtil 
after six months of age. The use of 
barley water has been found, in prac- 
tice, to enable some young infants to 
digest the curds of milk who would 
otherwise have been unable to do so. 
But as a rule it is probable that these 
cereal waters are not required until 
after the sixth or seventh month.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



They should not be fed to very young 
infants except under the direction of 
a physician. 

The late Prof. A. Jacoby of New 
York, an author of international rep- 
utation, stated that if he were re- 
stricted to the use of any one food 
in addition to cow's milli, it would be 
barley meal or oatmeal water, and 
that he preferred barley water to 
oatmeal water for a steady diet be- 
cause the latter tends to relax the 
bowels. Hence after the sixth or 
seventh month use barley water to 
dilute the baby's food in place of 
plain w^ater unless you find from ex- 
perience that it does not agree with 
your child. When the infant is con- 
stipated, substitute oatmeal water for 
the barley water. As the barley wa- 
ter is added the amount of sugar 
should be reduced. 

ARTIFICIAL FOODS 

Condensed Milk for Infants. — 
Condensed milk is the artificial food 
most commonly used, especially 
among the poor, but is not easily di- 
gestible especially by very yoimg and 
frail infants. Its effects are not 
satisfactory. It contains too much 
sugar and not enough fat. Babies 
fed on condensed milk alone are often 
fat but seldom strong. A fat baby 
is not always a healthy baby. Prac- 
tically every baby raised on con- 
densed milk alone shows signs of 
rickets or other disease. It may serve 
a good purpose when traveling or at 
other times of emergency when pure, 
fresh milk cannot be secured. Be- 
tween dirty, impure and stale cow's 
milk and condensed milk, choose the 
latter. When traveling or when the 
milk supply fails, condensed milk 
may be used to tide the infant over 
a period of danger, but do not use it 
any longer than is really necessary. 
It should never be used without the 
addition of fats — fresh cream if pos- 
sible. Or, if good cream cannot be 
had, give cod liver oil at the rate of 
five to twenty drops at each feeding. 
If you use condensed milk get the 
best that can be had. Borden's Eagle 
Brand is known to be well prepared 
and reliable. 



Manufactured Foods. — Do not be 
misled by the statements of any man- 
ufacturer of condensed milk or other 
artificial food that his product is a 
perfect substitute for mother's milk. 
All such statements are false. There 
is no perfect substitute for mother's 
milk, nor is there any artificial food 
that is equally as good as pure fresh 
cow's milk properly modified. The 
most commonly used foods upon the 
market may be classed as milk foods, 
malted foods and farinaceous foods. 
Horlick's, Borden's (malted) milk, 
and Mellin's are examples of the sec- 
ond class, and Eskay's of the third. 
None of these foods contain suflBcient 
fat. Some of them have an excess of 
starch which makes them unsuitable 
for an infant until the latter part of 
the first year. Some contain too 
much sugar. None of these foods 
should be used alone. Some authori- 
ties claim that they are harmful and 
that certain diseases have followed 
their prolonged use. Others consider 
them of considerable value. Many 
advocate combining their use with the 
breast milk to help the mother out 
during the latter part of the nursing 
period, especially after the fifth or 
sixth month. 

Notwithstanding the difference of 
opinion regarding the value of these 
foods, they are recommended by com- 
petent physicians and are used to 
seeming advantage by many infants, 
although they do not agree with 
others. They should be used under 
the advice of a physician, if at all, 
and mixed with diluted cow's milk 
for the purpose of breaking up the 
tough curds and rendering the milk 
more digestible. Barley water and 
oatmeal water are used for the same 
;purpose, but do not contain all the 
food elements to be found in the best 
types of prepared foods. 

The manufacturers of Horlick's 
Malted Milk assert that it does not 
require the addition of cow's milk; 
that it is composed of pure, rich 
cow's milk reduced to dryness and 
combined with an extract of malted 
wheat and barley. This food may 
perhaps be used alone, temporarily; 
but for continued use, milk should 
be added. 



THE CARE OP BABIES 



631 



Mellin's Food is said to be a dry 
extract from wheat and malt, and 
free from cane sugar and starch. 

Eskay's Food, according to the 
manufacturers, contains the more 
easily digested cereals combined with 
egg albumen. 

An analysis of Horlick's Malted 
Milk shows that it contains less fat 
than mother's milk and more sugar, 
and that it is free from starch. Mel- 
len's Food alone has practically no 
fats or starch and much more sugar 
than mother's milk. It should be 
used with milk. 

Eskay's Food, when properly 
mixed with milk, resembles breast 
milk very closely, except that there 
is some starch present. It is stated, 
however, that this starch is thorough- 
ly broken up and easily digested, and 
that the egg albumen contained is 
more easily digested than similar 
amounts of the albumen or curds of 
milk. 

OTHER FOODS FOR INFANTS 

Keep your baby largely on milk 
until well into the second year. This 
is the chief secret of successful in- 
fant feeding. There is far less neces- 
sity for a mixed diet of ordinary 
foods than is generally supposed. No 
other food than properly modified 
milk should be given until the end of 
the sixth or seventh month, except on 
the order of a physician. The ap- 
pearance of teeth at a moderately 
early age is simply an evidence of 
health. It is not an indication that 
the baby should be taught to eat 
solid food. When the teeth appear 
very early and in rapid succession, 
nutritive and nervous disturbances 
are apt to occur and the use of solid 
food may then lead to serious ill- 
ness. 

As a rule no solid food whatever 
should be given during the first year. 
After the seventh month, gruel made 
with barley, arrowroot or oatmeal 
may be given, beginning with very 
small quantities. At first four ounces 
of thick strained oatmeal and one- 
half ounce of orange juice may be 
added to the daily allowance of food. 
The quantity of gruel may be gradu- 



ally increased as the child grows 
older. The addition of a pinch of 
salt will make the food more palat- 
able. 

After the ninth month pure whole 
milk may be allowed in some cases 
and the child may have a crust 
of bread, or a small piece of zwie- 
back. 

After the tenth month beef, mut- 
ton or chicken broth thoroughly 
strained may be substituted for or 
added to a child's regular food. 

Soups and broths for infants 
should be very carefully prepared so 
as to be free from any excess of fat 
or bits of meat. They should be 
very sparingly seasoned. Fresh beef 
juice may be given in the latter part 
of the first year and in some cases 
even earlier in quantities of not over 
two teaspoonfuls a day. 

To prepare beef juice cut a half 
pound of fresh lean beef into small 
pieces and put them into a clean dry 
pan. Place the pan over a slow fire 
and turn the pieces of meat with a 
fork until the outside is gray. Broil 
very lightly. Express the juice with 
a lemon squeezer or meat press into 
a clean cup. About one to one and a 
half ounces should be obtained from 
a half pound of meat. Keep on ice, 
or in a cool place, until ready for 
feeding. Then raise to blood heat by 
placing the cup in warm water. Al- 
ways use the same day. 

Beef tea made from the extracts 
of beef found on the market may 
be given in small quantities after the 
first year. But remember there is 
no nutrition in beef tea and do not 
give it in place of regular food. 
Many practitioners advise the use of 
beef juice and beef tea much earlier 
than here stated, especially if the 
milk disagrees or fails to nourish the 
infant. They regard it as especially 
valuable when the teeth are slow in 
development or rickets are threat- 
ened. 

Orang-e juice in such cases is of 
the greatest value and will agree per- 
fectly with most children. It is a 
safe precaution, especially if pasteur- 
ized or cooked milk, or condensed 
milk or manufactured infants' food 
is given, to feed half an ounce of 



632 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



orange juice each day to all children 

over six months of age. 

Meat Broth Plain and Thickened. 
— Chop into small pieces one pound 
of lean beef, chicken or neck of mut- 
ton including some of the bone. Add 
a quart of water and let stand for 
two hours, then add salt and boil 
slowly for two hours down to one 
pint. While boiling add two table- 
spoonfuls of crushed barley, rice or 
oatmeal. Strain through muslin, 
cool and skim off the grease. 

"Egg Water. — This may sometimes 
be used to advantage in case of in- 
testinal disturbances, such that the 
baby cannot digest milk. To pre- 
pare, stir the white of a fresh egg 
into one pint of boiled water. Add 
a pinch of salt, shake thoroughly and 
strain. Keep in the ice box or other 
cool place and use the same day. 

Whey. — Warm one pint of milk to 
blood heat and add one teaspoonful 
of essence of pepsin or one junket 
tablet. Let stand until it jellies, 
then break up the curds with a fork 
and strain through muslin. Whey is 
sometimes used to advantage when 
the baby cannot digest cow's milk. 

Solid Foods. — The cutting of the 
eighth incisor or front teeth, which 
occurs usually during the twelfth 
month, may be taken as nature's in- 
dication that the child requires other 
food than milk. At this time if the 
infant is well and strong, a little 
stale bread, at least one day old, 
may be given with fresh milk in 
place of one of the regular feedings. 
This may soon be supplemented by 
a small quantity of well cooked hom- 
iny, oatmeal or cornmeal mush. But 
keep in mind constantly the fact that 
milk is the most important article of 
the diet, and that these foods are 
merely supplementary. Do not feed 
the baby any of the ready-cooked or 
pre-digested breakfast foods. Buy 
the natural cereals and cook them at 
home. Cereals should be cooked at 
least three hours in a double boiler, 
or preferably over night in a tireless 
cooker. They should be strained 
through cheese cloth or muslin. 

If the above foods are taken with- 
out difficulty and no bad results are 
observed, give stale bread liberally 



buttered. This satisfies the infant's 
desire for solid food and also affords 
an easily digested and nourishing 
form of fat. 

At fifteen months, a soft boiled egg 
may be given as the noon feeding. 
About the middle of the second year, 
or when sixteen teeth have developed, 
other and more solid foods may be 
given. But throughout the entire 
period of infancy, food other than 
milk should be selected and prepared 
with the greatest care and given in 
moderation. During the second year 
children are almost invariably over- 
fed. 

Diet of Older Children. — Between 
one and a half and two and a half 
years of age a child may have bread 
and butter, orange, potatoes and cer- 
tain other vegetables, certain fruits 
and certain meats. The bread should 
be at least one day old and may in- 
clude toast, zwieback, graham, oat- 
meal and gluten crackers. Porridge 
may be oatmeal, rice (cooked three 
hours), hominy (cooked six hours), 
farina (cooked one hour), cornmeal 
(cooked two hours), barley meal or 
wheaten grits. All should be thor- 
oughly cooked for the time stated, 
or over night in a iireless cooker. 
Strain through cheese cloth or muslin 
and serve with certified or pasteur- 
ized milk. The meat may be rare 
roast beef, fresh cooked mutton or 
chicken. AH should be finely minced. 
The vegetables may be well cooked 
spinach or potato. The latter should 
be fed in small quantities, freshly 
baked and lightly broken up and 
salted. Potato is a starchy food and 
hard for an infant to digest. It is 
much more wholesome baked than 
boiled. The fruit may be ripe apples 
(better baked), grapes, freed from 
the stones and skins, stewed prunes 
and orange pulp, freed from the 
fibrous portion. Fruit should be 
given in great moderation, if at all, 
in summer. Other suitable foods are 
baked custards or junket. 

A piece of rare roast beef to suck, 
bread with dish gravy (not the heavy 
thickened and highly seasoned gravy) 
and soft boiled or poached eggs may 
form additions to the dietary which 
may be extended gradually to meet 



THE CARE OF BABIES

developments as the baby grows into 
childhood. But either for an infant 
or a child, overfeeding is far more 
injurious than underfeeding. 

Improper Foods. — Hundreds of in- 
fants have been killed by the mis- 
takes of parents in giving them other 
and improper foods. Never feed the 
baby at the table from the food pre- 
pared for other members of the fam- 
ily. The table foods may be poison- 
ous to the infant. Never give a 
child under two years of age ham, 
bacon, or pork in any other form; 
cabbage, pickles or other succulent 
vegetables; coffee, tea, beer, wine, 
cider or any other alcoholic liquor 
of any kind; bananas, berries or 
other fruit except orange juice or 
pulp, prune juice and stewed or 
baked apple. Do not give pie or 
pastry, nuts, cake, candy, ice cream, 
or any other kind of sweets. Above 
all never dope your baby with drugs, 
nostrums, or patent foods of any 
kind, relying upon the statements of 
unprincipled manufacturers, drug- 
gists or other venders, or those who 
have " tried and can recommend 
them." Such advice is often as ig- 
norant as it is well intended. The 
kind of medicine or food preparation 
which may agree with your neighbor's 
baby may totally disagree with yours. 
Don't experiment with your baby. If 
you think it needs medicine or a 
change of food consult a competent 
physician to find out what is the mat- 
ter. Then be guided implicitly by 
his advice. 

PASTEURIZED AND STERIIIZED 
MILK 

Home Pasteurization of Milk. — 
Pasteur, the French chemist (whose 
name has become a household word 
from his discovery of a treatment 
which prevents hydrophobia), was 
once employed by the French Gov- 
ernment to stud}'^ the causes of fer- 
mentation in wines and beer. He 
found that these changes were 
brought about by the action of micro- 
organisms (germs). He further dis- 
covered that these germs could be de- 
stroyed at the comparatively low 
temperature of 140° F. by maintain- 



ing this degree of heat for twenty 
minutes. Hence this process is called 
" pasteurization." 

The germs which cause fermenta- 
tion or souring of milk or other food 
products can be destroyed more 
quickly at or near 213°, the tempera- 
ture of boiling water. This process is 
called " sterilization." But this de- 
stroys much of the flavor and nutri- 
tive value of milk as food. The ad- 
vantage of pasteurization, when prop- 
erly conducted, is that neither the 
flavor nor the food value of the milk 
is affected.

To pasteurize milk in bottles, 
place a saucer in the bottom of a 
small tin pail and stand the bottle 
of milk on this with the cap on. 
Now fill the pail up to within three 
or four inches of the top of the 
bottle with hot water — but not so 
hot as to break the bottle — and then 
stand the pail and its contents on 
the stove. The instant the water be- 
gins to boil (not simmer) remove

it from the pail and cool it as rapidly 
as possible. 

Milk properly pasteurized is not 
injurious to infants, although it is 
not considered quite so good as clean, 
pure unpasteurized milk. Most doc- 
tors think it is entirely wholesome. 
Others suspect that its prolonged 
use may tend to cause scurvy or 
rickets. If such results are feared, 
orange juice, or its equivalent, may 
be given as a preventive. The dan- 
gers from pasteurized milk, if any, 
are slight in comparison with those 
from unpasteurized milk of doubt- 
ful origin, especially in summer where 
milk has to be transported any con- 
siderable distance before delivery. 
Pasteurization, if the milk is after- 
wards kept clean until used, will cer- 
tainly eliminate all danger of diar- 
rhoeal or other intestinal trouble. But 
observe that this process merely kills 
the living bacteria then present in 
the milk. It does not eliminate dirt, 
nor any chemical poisons cast off by 
germs which the milk may contain. 
Nor does it prevent the milk from 
afterwards becoming contaminated 
with other bacteria. Pasteurization, 
in other words, is not a panacea for 
making dirty milk wholesome. Nor 
is it a substitute for painstaking 
cleanliness in the home. It is a 
makeshift at best, but nevertheless 
should be adopted whenever the milk 
delivered at your door is known or 
suspected to be warm, stale or dirty. 
As a rule unless you can afford to 
buy certified milk, it is better to pas- 
teurize the milk and be on the safe 
side. But it is a good plan, before 
doing so, to consult your physician. 

Sterilization of Milk. — Pasteuriza- 
tion is always to be preferred over 
sterilization, provided milk can after- 
wards be kept clean and cold. Ster- 
ilization makes milk harder to digest 
and decreases its food value. The 
prolonged use of such milk leads to 
stomach and intestinal diseases, rick- 
ets, loss of weight, failure of bones 
to grow properly, and other harmful 
conditions. But between dirty milk 
and cooked milk, sterilization is the 
lesser evil. Those who cannot obtain 
ice, and especially those who are 
obliged to live in unsanitary condi- 



tions such that the milk is sure to 
become contaminated, would better 
sterilize rather than pasteurize the 
milk, especially in summer. In win- 
ter the milk can be kept cool by 
means of a window box. This will 
afiford the baby some relief from the 
evil effects of sterilization. 

To scald or sterilize milk which 
comes in bottles place the bottle on 
a saucer in the bottom of a tin pail 
as for pasteurization. Leave the cap 
on. Fill up the pail to within three 
or four inches of the top and bring 
to a boil. The instant the water be- 
gins to boil (not simmer) remove the 
boiler from the stove. Take care 
that the milk does not boil. If it 
should boil, throw it away. Boiled 
or over-heated milk, if fed to a baby 
for any considerable length of time, 
will produce a most distressing type 
of scurvy. Remove the boiler from 
the stove and let the bottle of milk 
stand in the water for about twenty 
minutes. Then cool as quickly as 
possible. 

Or, if milk is bought in bulk, pour 
it into a sterilized glass fruit jar as 
recommended for pasteurization and 
proceed as for bottled milk. 

Observe that sterilized milk is more 
susceptible to contamination from 
germs than raw milk. Hence take 
care that everything that comes in 
contact with scalded milk is scrupu- 
lously clean. Remember that the ice 
box cannot be cleaned too often. 

When to Pasteurize or Sterilize. — 
Certified milk or good fresh milk 
which has been kept clean nnd cold 
needs no preservative. Do not 
" scald," or sterilize or pasteurize such 
milk. But if milk is dirty, or sours 
quickly, or if there is other evidence 
that it has not been kept clean or 
cold, the sooner it is pasteurized or 
sterilized after it comes into the 
house, the better. If the milk is to 
be kept in the original bottle or in 
a glass fruit jar or similar receptacle 
during the day, and the baby's bottle 
is to be filled from this as required, 
the best plan is to pasteurize or ster- 
ilize the milk as soon as it is received 
and before it is put into the ice box. 
But if milk is to be modified, and 
especially if there are enough bottles 



THE CARE OF BABIES 



635 



so that a separate bottle can be pre- 
pared for each feeding, the better 
plan is to pasteurize or sterilize the 
modified milk or prepared food after 
it has been mixed and placed in the 
baby's bottles or other receptacles in 
which it is to be kept for the day. 

Adulteration of IVIllk. — There are 
still some dairymen and dealers who 
think it is cheaper to kill the bacteria 
in dirty, warm, stale milk by means 
of germicides than to adopt means 
to keep the milk clean, cool and 
sweet. Such adulteration is forbid- 
den by law in many states, and all 
offenders should be vigorously prose- 
cuted. Keep a sharp lookout for 
adulterated milk and occasionally test 
the milk you receive for boric acid, 
borax, formaldehyde or bicarbonate 
of soda by methods elsewhere recom- 
mended. Or request your physician, 
or the health officials of your com- 
munity, if any, to test it for you. 
Never use such preservatives your- 
self, nor buy milk from a dealer who 
uses them. You can never tell how 
much he has used, nor how much 
may have been used by others before 
the milk came to him. Preservatives 
are never harmless and if present in 
large quantities may be very injuri- 
ous or even poisonous. 

CARE OF MILK IN THE HOME 

If the milk producer and the milk 
dealer have done their duty there is 
daily left at the consumer's door a 
bottle of clean, cold, unadulterated 
milk. By improper treatment in the 
home the milk may become unfit for 
food, especially for babies. This bad 
treatment consists in placing it in un- 
clean vessels; in exposing it unneces- 
sarily to the air; in failing to keep 
it cool up to the time of using it; and 
in exposing it to flies. 

Milk absorbs impurities — collects 
bacteria — whenever it is exposed to 
the air or placed in unclean vessels. 
If there is a sediment in the bottom 
of the container, after the milk has 
stood an hour or two, it indicates 
filthy habits on the part of the pro- 
ducer. The remedy is, change milk- 
men. This sediment is almost invari- 
ably fecal matter (manure) that has 



fallen into the milk pail from filthy 
cows. Most farmers who allow this 
matter to get into the milk are care- 
ful to strain it out, but they cannot 
strain out the unmistakable flavor 
which it imparts to milk. Remember 
that clean, pure milk is nearly free 
from taste or odor. If milk tastes 
or smells of the stable it is probably 
dirty. 

To test milk for dirt place a good- 
sized button in the bottom of an or- 
dinary tin funnel and upon this a 
piece of dampened absorbent cotton 
about the size of a twenty-five cent 
piece and about one-sixteenth of an 
inch in thickness. Carefully pour the 
entire contents of the milk bottle 
into this funnel and let it filter. The 
cotton will catch every particle of 
sediment or dirt which the milk may 
contain. Remove the cotton and 
place it upon a piece of white paper 
near the stove to dry. If much dirt 
is shown, ask your milkman to take 
a look at it. Or, if you live in a city 
mail it, with a complaint, to the 
Board of Health. 

The danger to health from dirty 
methods of keeping and milking cows, 
dirty milkers and dirty milk vessels 
increases with every moment milk is 
allowed to stand in a temperature 
over 40° or 45° F. Injurious spores 
and bacteria remain dormant or in- 
crease very slowly at lower tempera- 
tures, but as the temperature rises 
up to 60° or 70° F., or thereabouts, 
they develop and multiply with aston- 
ishing rapidity. A bottle of dirty 
milk standing in the sun for an hour 
or two in the early morning may breed 
millions of injurious bacteria and be- 
come totally unfit for hiuiian food. 

The feeding of cow's milk to in- 
fants, to be at all safe, entails the 
following tedious and never-ending 
operations: Securing fresh milk 
every day; home pasteurization; 
sterilization of all milk containers in- 
cluding boiling of feeding bottles, 
nipples, etc., for each and every 
feeding; refrigeration — storage in 
scrupulously clean ice boxes — and 
milk modification, all to be carefully 
performed and varied according to 
age or condition of the child. 

Even if the milk is clean, fresh and 



636 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



cool when it is delivered at j'our door, 
or if you then liill the germs which it 
may contain by home pasteurization, 
it may afterwards become unfit for 
food, especially for babies, by im- 
proper treatment. This may occur if 
you place it in unclean vessels, expose 
it unnecessarily to the air, or fail to 
keep it cool up to the time of using it. 
Hence the following suggestions. 

Buy bottle milk, at least for yoiir 
baby, if you can. Keep milk in the 
original bottle till needed for im- 
mediate consumption. Carefully wipe 
or rinse the bottle, especially the 
mouth, before pouring any milk from 
it, so that dust or dirt which may 
have gathered thereon or on the cap 
will not get into the milk. Do not 
pour back Into the bottle milk which 
has been exposed to the air by being 
placed in other vessels. Keep the 
bottle covered with a paper cap as 
long as milk is in it and when not ac- 
tually pouring from it. If the pa- 
per cap has been punctured, cover 
the bottle with an inverted tumbler. 

The sanitary containers that are 
used but once and then destroyed are 
preferable to those of glass but the 
consumer seems to object to them 
because, not being transparent, no 
cream line can be seen. When their 
value from a health standpoint is un- 
derstood the sanitary containers will 
be universally adopted as they al- 
ready have been in some cities. 

Dipping milk from large cans and 
pouring it into customers' receptacles 
on the street, expose it to contami- 
nation from the air and otherwise. 
Drawing milk from the faucet of a 
retailer's can is objectionable for an- 
other reason. The milk is not thor- 
oughly mixed. Hence some consum- 
ers receive less than their due pro- 
portion of cream. But if you must 
buy dipped milk, do not set out over 
night an uncovered vessel to receive 
it. Cats, dogs or tramps may con- 
taminate the milk by drinking from 
it. At best it will collect thousands 
of bacteria from street dust before 
morning. Have the milk received by 
some member of the family if possi- 
ble, or set out a bowl covered with a 
plate, or better still, provide your- 
self with several glass preserving 



jars kept for this special purpose. 
Use jars with the clamp glass top. 
Avoid the screw tops. Omit the rub- 
ber band. They are difl5cult to keep 
clean. Do not use a pitcher. It 
cannot be tightly covered on account 
of the projecting spout. 

Take the milk into the house as 
soon as possible after delivery, par- 
ticularly in hot weather. Sometimes 
milk delivered as early as 4 a. m. re- 
mains outdoors imtil 9 or 10 o'clock. 
This is wrong. If you cannot receive 
the milk as soon as delivered provide 
a small wooden box or other shelter 
to protect it from the sun and insist 
that the milkman use it. 

The best way of serving milk on 
the table, from a sanitary standpoint, 
is in the bottle or fruit jar in which 
it is received. At all events, pour 
out only what is needed for immedi- 
ate use and keep the rest in the 
original receptacle. Never pour the 
milk into a bowl or pitcher for stor- 
age, nor pour back into the bottle 
or jar milk which has been exposed 
to the air. In fact, do not mix milk 
— the mixture always descends to 
the quality of its worst part. Milk 
deteriorates by exposure to the air 
of the nursery, kitchen, pantry or 
refrigerator in two ways: by con- 
tamination from germs and by ab- 
sorption of odors. Cover milk when 
not actually pouring from it by turn- 
ing over the jar or bottle a small bowl 
or tumbler, or use a cork or cap of 
sterilized gauze or cotton wool, both 
of which are germ-proof. Never ex- 
pose uncovered milk in a refrigerator 
containing any kind of food, especial- 
ly strong-smelling foods like fish, cab- 
bage or onions. 

Milk cannot be properly kept with- 
out ice. If you have a refrigerator 
put the milk into it promptly. Un- 
less it comes into actual contact with 
the ice, it will keep best in the bot- 
tom of the ice box. The cold air de- 
scends. If you can get ice but have 
no refrigerator, you can make a cheap 
ice box that can be operated for less 
than three cents a day in which to pre- 
serve a baby's milk, as follows: 

A Cheap Ice Box. — Secure an ordi- 
nary wooden box, 13 by 18 inches, 
with a depth of 11 i inches, from 



THE CARE OF BABIES 



637 



your grocer. In the bottom of the 
box place a substantial layer of saw- 
dust. On this set a tin pail or can, 
8 inches in diameter and high enough 
to hold a quart bottle of milk. Care 
should be taken that the pail rests 
on sawdust — not on the wood bottom 
of the box. Around the pail place 
a cylinder of tin a little larger than 
the pail, then pack sawdust about the 
cylinder — not between pail and cyl- 
inder — -up to top of the cylinder. 
On the cover of the box nail about 
fifty layers of newspaper. Set the 
milk bottle in the pail and pack 
broken ice about the bottle. A re- 
frigerator of this description will 
hold two quart bottles of milk, or 
four eight-ounce feeding bottles. It 
can be operated for about two cents 
per day. To prevent rusting, a little 
soda may be placed in the can each 
day. The little expense involved is 
nothing as compared with the cost 
of sickness and death. 

A Window Box. — Most families 
discontinue taking ice for the re- 
frigerator during half the year or 
more. During such times, if milk is 
allowed to stand in the pantry it 
quickly becomes warm and unfit for 
infants' food. Yet the outdoor tem- 
perature would keep the milk sweet 
for some time. A window box may 
be constructed with sides made of 
old blinds, slats, or boards perfor- 
ated with auger holes for ventilation, 
and provided with a solid bottom 
and tight slanting roof. Attach this 
outside the pantry window where it 
can be reached by simply raising the 
sash. Line with wire netting to keep 
out insects, especially flies. Such a 
box costs next to nothing, and serves 
to keep not only the baby's milk, but 
butter, meat and other provisions 
when the refrigerator is not in use. 

Or stand a deep dish or pail of 
water by an open window away from 
the sun. Put a narrow board or wire 
screen across the top and on this 
stand the milk bottles or jars. "Wrap 



the bottles in a wet cloth and let the 
end of the cloth extend to the bot- 
tom of the water. The cloth will 
be kept wet by capillary attraction 
and the water, by evaporation, will 
cool the milk. 

By some such method you must 
keep the milk and cream cool until 
used if you desire to safeguard your 
baby's health. 

Care of the Ice Box. — Keep the re- 
frigerator sweet and clean. Person- 
ally inspect it at least once a week. 
See that the outlet for melted ice 
is kept open and the space under the 
ice rack is clean. Scald the place 
where food is kept every week with 
a strong sal soda solution. A single 
drop of spoiled milk or small par- 
ticle of other neglected food will con- 
taminate a refrigerator in a f«w 
days. 

Care of Milk Bottles. — As soon as 
a milk bottle is empty, rinse it in 
clear lukewarm or cold water until 
it looks clean and set it bottom side 
up to drain. Do not use it for any 
other purpose than holding milk. 
Never return filthy bottles. Rinse, 
wash and scald all utensils with 
which milk comes in contact every 
time they are used. Do not wash 
them in dish water or wipe with an 
ordinary dish towel. This will only 
serve to smear them with an invisi- 
ble coating of grease. Boil them in 
clean water containing a little borax 
or washing soda and set them away 
unwiped. If a case of typhoid, scar- 
let fever or diphtheria breaks out in 
a family do not return any milk bot- 
tles to the milkman except with the 
knowledge of the attending physician 
and under conditions prescribed by 
him. Never accept milk from any 
family, dairyman or dealer when you 
know, or suspect, that there are con- 
tagious diseases in his family, or that 
they have recently been exposed to 
such contagion. The above sugges- 
tions apply to cream as well as to 
milk.

Health Hints. — It is much better 
to prevent disease than to cure it. 
Health depends upon strict adherence 
to a few simple rules. Most of the 
sickness of to-day is preventable, and 
is due primarily to carelessness in liv- 
ing habits. It is not enough, how- 
ever, simply not to be ill. Many 
people who are not sick, still are not 
well. To really enjoy life, one should 
be at his best and know the thrill of 
abounding health and the joy of well- 
being. Many people never experience 
this, and the slightest change in their 
environment makes them uncomfort- 
able; yet they would not say they 
were ill. 

Plenty of fresh air, a sane and 
simple diet and regular exercise, com- 
bined with a care-free state of mind, 
are the secrets of a normal, healthy 
life. They are so simple that people 
overlook them. 

Fresh Air. — Sleep with the win- 
dows open, but be protected from the 
direct wind. Night air is not only 
not harmful, but absolutely healthful. 
See to it also that you work under 
conditions of fresh air; it will prove 
a tonic. Bad air depresses all the or- 
gans of the body. Houses, working 
places, offices, hotels, trains, are 
abominably ventilated. Keep on the 
lookout or you will be constantly poi- 



638 



soned. Tenting out in the summer 
time or sleeping on a screened porch 
or roof will prove to the tired worker 
who is run down a wonderful re- 
storer. Make friends with the fresh 
air. 

Exercise. — Just this simple but 
important suggestion: Each person 
must have during each day a fair 
amount of rather vigorous exercise 
of the large muscles of the body. By 
this I mean the muscles of the trunk. 
These muscles are closely related to 
the most important organs of the 
body and the latter depend upon the 
muscles for their vitality. Bending 
the body forward and backward at 
the hips and sideways and twisting 
at the waist are very valuable exer- 
cises. Walking and slow running are 
exceedingly important, especially if 
indulged in until they cause deep 
breathing and perspiration. Of 
course outdoor exercise is best. Hill 
climbing is splendid, especially for a 
weak heart, if done with frequent in- 
tervals of rest. Everyone should have 
a favorite outdoor recreation aside 
from and different from his daily 
work. Baseball and tennis for the 
vigorous, golf and horseback riding 
and wheeling for the more mature, are 
excellent. A medicine ball used with 
a variety of movements is fine for e.\- 



FIRST AID TO THE INJURED 



639 



ercising the large muscles referred to. 
The great increase in the so-called or- 
ganic diseases, namely, diseases of the 
heart, lungs, digestion, and Itidneys, 
reveals the need for systematic exer- 
cise. People who are inclined to 
obesity, in particular, should select 
some helpful forms of exercise. Ex- 
ercise should be tai^en in such a way 
as to be real fun, not work; it should 
be pleasure and not stern duty. 

Bathing. — The day's work should 
be followed by a short, refreshing 
bath. Nothing will prove so cheering 
as this. When depressed or irritable, 
a bath will oftentimes drive dull care 
away. People with weak hearts must 
be cautioned in using very cold water, 
as it is quite a shock to the nervous 
system. The average person, how- 
ever, will find a quick, cool sponge 
bath decidedly stimulating. Many 
prefer it on arising in the morning. 
If one's work causes the skin to be 
moist during the day, it will be more 
refreshing to take it at the close of 
the day's work, possibly, and best 
before the evening meal, allowing 
some time between. 

Returning for the moment to the 
subject of exercise, may I hold out 
one word of warning? Housewives 
and men on farms are particularly 
liable when alone without help near 
by to often lift an object or move it 
which in the act demands great ef- 
fort. This is exceedingly dangerous, 
as in efforts of strain the blood pres- 
sure increases and harm may result. 
Don't attempt to lift or move any 
object requiring great effort. 

Diet. — What one eats is closely 
related to how one feels. Most 
people undoubtedly eat too much. 
This is true particularly of people 
who work indoors and do not exercise 
much. Such people should eat meat 
but once a day, as meat is only re- 
quired in quantities by persons who 
work vigorously with their muscles. 
I do not believe people should be fad- 
dists in reference to eating. To eat 
well-cooked foods, plenty of vege- 
tables, liberally of fruits and cereals 
and sparingly of meat and pastries, 
all well masticated when eaten, is the 
wisest course. It is foolish to be too 
fanciful in the choice of foods and to 



punish oneself in eating raw foods 
and unpalatable mixtures. 

Just a simple word of counsel as to 
what not to eat: Any food which is 
tasted an hour or more after eating 
is being digested with difficulty. This 
will differ as to effects in different 
people. Such foods should be elimi- 
nated. Some people find radishes, 
onions, cucumbers, and sausage very 
difficult of digestion, while others 
thrive upon them. The latter can eat 
them with impunity, while the former 
must do without them, or uncom- 
fortable and even serious results will 
follow. Salads and highly seasoned 
dressings should be eaten with cau- 
tion. 

Fatigue. — This is a day when men 
and women are constantly overwork- 
ing. Some housewives and many bus- 
iness men never know when to stop. 
Consequently, they constantly over- 
work and never get fully rested. 
They are tired and often don't know 
it. They wonder why they are peev- 
ish and irritable. The truth is their 
blood is filled with fatigue products, 
their nerves are tired and insensible. 
Nothing but complete rest will help. 
Under such physical conditions a 
housewife cannot be a good mother 
nor a man a good father. Working 
habits must be adjusted so as to per- 
mit of rest, or living becomes miser- 
able. The housewife should learn to 
regulate her working hours just as 
workingmen do, or health will pay 
the penalty. 

A further and final word in refer- 
ence to health: Consult a doctor fre- 
quently. Many people call the doc- 
tor as a last resort. Tliis is wrong, 
and many a serious illness results 
which otherwise might have been pre- 
vented. The eyes, teeth, and throat, 
should be examined occasionally, es- 
pecially when they are sensitive, as 
diseases of these are peculiarly re- 
lated to the depression of the whole 
body and affect temperament as well. 
This is particularly true of children. 

GENERAL HINTS IN TIME OF 
ACCIDENT 

Keep cool. Try and keep others 
cool. This is the great need. In 



640 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



time of panic, or fire, or accident, 
serious results may be avoided if 
some person is calm enough to take 
charge of things and inspire confi- 
dence. It is well for one to get ac- 
customed to the sight of blood. 
Many cannot control themselves 
under such circumstances. It is a 
good practice to witness an opera* 
tion occasionally, or to assist in dress- 
ing a wound for the purpose of 
schooling oneself. Always send for a 
surgeon immediately in time of ac- 
cident. In doing so, explain as fully 
as possible what the difficulty is, or 
probably may be, so that the physi- 
cian can come prepared. Always see 
that the patient is made comfortable 
in a quiet place. Keep curious 
people away. Loosen collars and 
corset, especially all clothing aljout 
the neck and chest. If the face of 
the injured or unconscious person is 
pale, lower the head. In sunstroke, 
or where the individual's face is 
flushed, have the head high. Do not 
do too much. Do not touch affected 
parts with the hands. Moisten cloth- 
ing in removing from wounds. In 
many instances it will be best to cut 
off the clothing to prevent further in- 
jury. 

How to Dress Wounds. — The 
first essential is to thoroughly cleanse 
the wound and remove all foreign ma- 
terial. This can be done with clean 
water which has been boiled for at 
least ten minutes. The hands and 
arms to the elbow should be cleansed. 
The water can be applied with ster- 
ilized absorbent cotton. After the 
wound is thus cleansed, use a mild 
antiseptic wash. A saturated solu- 
tion of boric acid (not borax) may 
be used. By saturated solution is 
meant as much boric acid as water 
will contain in solution. 

If the wound is a smooth cut, it 
will bleed profusely, as the blood has 
difficulty in securing a hold in order 
to clot. After the wound is cleansed, 
the edges of it can be brought to- 
gether by means of adhesive plaster. 
\Vhere this cannot be done, a surgeon 
will be required to stitch the edges 
together. 

If the head be injured, the patient 
should lie down with the head resting 



upon a pillow or cushion covered 
with a clean towel, taking care that 
the injured part be kept from con- 
tact with surrounding articles. 

If the arm be injured, it should, as 
a rule, be brought across in front of 
the chest and supported in a sling. 

If the lower limb be wounded, it 
may be supported in a comfortable 
position by resting upon a cushion or 
blanket. 

In wounds of the chest, the head 
and shoulders should be raised by 
one or more pillows until the patient 
is able to breathe comfortably. 

If the abdomen be wounded, the 
patient should be made to lie down, 
with his knees drawn up, and turned 
over toward the uninjured side; or 
upon the back if the wound be in 
front. 

Before dressing the wound the 
nails should be thoroughly cleansed 
with a brush and rings removed from 
the fingers. After cleansing the 
hands, do not touch anything not 
absolutely clean. All vessels used 
should be cleansed with boiling water 
before using. 

If the wound is jagged, the dead 
pieces of tissue must be removed and 
extra precaution taken to remove all 
foreign particles; the latter can be 
removed with pincers. Never close 
up a wound until the bleeding has 
been stop2)ed, as a small artery may 
be ruptured, and this must be con- 
trolled first. If the wound is covered 
with grease or soot or dirt, it can be 
removed by using gauze moistened in 
turpentine or benzine. 

A punctured wound, such as an in- 
jury produced by stepping on a nail 
or from the penetration of the point 
of an ice pick is dangerous, because 
the wound closes and excludes the 
air, thus making the wound favor- 
able to the development of the lock- 
jaw germ. This is all the more likely 
to occur if one steps on a rusty nail 
in the vicinity of a stable, as the 
lockjaw germ, or tetanus germ, is a 
dirt germ and thrives in such lo- 
calities. 

The best treatment for a closed 
wound is to open it and let the air in, 
and keep it thus exposed, as the lock- 
jaw germ cannot thrive in the pres- 



FIRST AID TO THE INJURED 



641 



ence of air. Of course the wound 
when thus opened should be cleansed 
the same as any other wound. 

If a needle or splinter has been the 
cause of the wound, see that not a 
particle remains. 

In removing a splinter, see that a 
fair amount of the splinter is ex- 
posed, so that a good hold can be 
got on it by inserting the blade of 
a penknife under it, and press down 
upon the flesh around the top of the 
splinter with the thumb nail and 
draw it out gently. Sometimes it is 
necessary to enlarge the wound some 
to get at the splinter or other object. 
If the splinter is under a finger nail, 
it may be necessary to pare away 
much of the nail in order to expose 
the splinter. 

After wounds are ready for final 
dressing, cover the wound with felted 
cotton, then apply bandages. Fish 
hooks usually have to be pushed 
through the tissues, as they cannot 
be withdrawn. Tlie eyelet of the 
hook will have to be filed or cut off 
to allow it to pass through. 

FIRST AID IN TIME OF INJURY 

The only excuse for acting in time 
of injury is the absence of a physi- 
cian. Always send for a doctor and 
do the necessary things during the in- 
terval of his coming. Of course there 
are occasions when a doctor is not 
available; then, of course, more tlior- 
ough treatment and action is neces- 
sary and permissible. 

Before entering into the considera- 
tion of specific treatment of condi- 
tions, it may be wise to say a word or 
two in reference to equipment. It 
will be well to have handy in the 
house, or in camp, or when on a 
tramp, a medicine case containing at 
least the following remedies: 

Whisky. — Whisky of a good 
quality is valuable for many condi- 
tions, especially in case of snake bite, 
when it is a specific. Care should be 
used in giving it to children. 

Tincture of Peppermint is splen- 
did for relieving colic, bowel troubles, 
and is a remedy for vomiting. The 
dose is 10 to 30 drops on sugar. 

Tincture of Ginger is also good 



for similar conditions, and the dose 
is 10 to 40 drops in sweetened water. 

Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia is 
an indispensable remedy to have 
about. It is a strong stimulant as an 
inhalant and can also be adminis- 
tered internally, the dose being 10 to 
30 drops in sweetened water. It is 
efficient in restoring people in a faint- 
ing condition by letting them use it 
as a smelling bottle. 

Ammonia Water is quite a differ- 
ent remedy, and is not for internal 
use. It is good for insect bites of 
any kind. 

Tincture of Arnica is used for 
bruises, wounds, and cuts. Cloths wet 
with it and applied to bruises are val- 
uable helps. 

Witch-hazel likewise is helpful as 
a lotion for sprains, wounds and con- 
tusions. 

Spirits of Camphor is also valuable 
for smelling purposes and for inflam- 
mations. The internal dose is 1 to 20 
drops on sugar. It is good to over- 
come gas in the bowels. 

Bicarbonate of Soda, namely bak- 
ing soda — not washing soda — is a 
good powder for burns and is an 
antidote for acid poisoning of any 
kind. 

Vaseline is a salve which can be 
put to many uses in treating burns, 
wounds, chafing, and scalds. 

Antiseptic Solution. — In addition 
to the above it is very important to 
have a good antiseptic wash with 
which to cleanse wounds of all kinds. 

Carbolic Acid Solution is good in 
the strength of 1 part of carbolic 
acid to 25 of water. 

Corrosive Sublimate is good, but 
there is more danger from poison, as 
it contains mercury. Tablets can be 
secured from druggists which can be 
used in a pint or quart of water, ac- 
cording to the strength. There are 
a number of popular prepared anti- 
septic solutions, such as listerine, 
which are very convenient to have in 
the house for ready use. 

In addition to the above, a few 
roll bandages of various sizes should 
be secured as well as adhesive plaster 
and a good-sized package of steril- 
ized absorbent cotton. In a camp, or 
in places where accidents occur fre- 



642

quently, this should be supplemented 
by some splints of pliable wood. 
Good, complete first-aid outfits, con- 
taining most of the above, can be se- 
cured from such firms as Johnson & 
Johnson, of New Brunswick, N. J., or 
from the National First Aid to the 
Injured Society of Boston, or the 
New York First Aid Society of New 
York City. 

POISONS AND THEIR ANTIDOTES 

In treating this important subject, 
much could be said, but as it might 
prove confusing, I shall try and con- 
dense the information in the smallest 
possible space and make my sug- 
gestions very simple and clear. 

In cases of poisoning, one must act 
quickly and keep cool. If the person 
affected is unconscious, an empty 
bottle or burns upon the mouth may 
reveal the cause of poisoning. 

There are several things to be done 
in the treatment of poisoning: (1) 
Eliminate the poison from the stom- 
ach; (^2) neutralize the poison by giv- 
ing an antidote; (3) treat the general 
symptoms produced by the poisoning. 
Get these three things clear in the 
mind in acting. 

The material is eliminated by being 
vomited. Vomiting can be induced 
in the following ways: use mustard 
and warm water, beginning with a 
glassful and repeating if necessary. 
If ipecac is in tlie house — and it is a 
good thing to have it about — give 
about a teaspoonful of sirup of ipecac 
to a child or a tablespoonful to a 
grown person every few minutes until 
vomiting is induced. Tickling the 
throat by inserting the forefinger in 
it usually brings quick results. In 
irritating poisons, like carbolic or 
mercury, it is wise not to produce 
vomiting, owing to the lacerated con- 
dition of the walls of the stomach. In 
most instances, however, it is wise 
to induce vomiting. Frequently the 
poison itself produces it. 

Antidotes. — In nearly all cases of 
poisoning, olive oil, if available, can 
be given in large doses, namely, a 
pint or more, as it neutralizes most 
poisons except phosphorus. This can 
be followed by the whites of two 



eggs. When in doubt, use the oil fol- 
lowed by the eggs. 

In giving antidotes, two general 
principles should be observed: namely, 
that acids tend to neutraUze alkalies 
and alkalies neutralize acids. 

For poisoning from acids, such as 
muriatic, oxalic, acetic, sulphuric (oil 
of vitriol), nitric, or tartaric, use 
soapsuds, magnesia, limewater, whit- 
ing, plaster scraped from the wall, 
milk, oil, and baking soda. Also by 
vomiting. In feeding the patient do 
so by the rectum, as the stomach will 
be sore. 

For poisoning from alkalies, such as 
ammonia, potash, or soda, use acids 
as an antidote, such as vinegar, lemon 
juice, and orange juice, followed by 
large doses of olive oil, castor oil, and 
emetics. 

Another group of poisons are the 
narcotics. In this class are chloro- 
form, chloral, ether, and the opium 
preparations , such as opium, mor- 
phine, laudanum, paregoric, and 
soothing sirups. Provide plenty of 
fresh air, induce artificial breathing, 
apply ammonia to nostrils, give ca- 
thartics and stimulants, such as cof- 
fee, brandy, and strychnine. Compel 
the patient to move about. If uncon- 
scious, keep head low. 

The following poisons are men- 
tioned specifically with their treat- 
ment: 

Carbolic Acid and Creosote. — Use 
powdered chalk, Epsom salts, white 
of egg, milk, glycerin, and oil. 
Empty the stomach. 

Alcohol (Treatment). — Keep the 
patient active by pinching, slapping 
with wet towel, or hot and cold 
douches to head and spine; give 
plenty of strong cofifee; inhale am- 
monia cautiously, and use artificial 
respiration if unconscious. 

Poisonous Mushrooms (Toad- 
stools). — Give emetics, castor oil, 
stimulants, and apply heat. Use 
same treatment for poisoning caused 
by eating mussels or fish. 

Belladonna (Deadly Niffhtshadc). 
— This drug is contained in cough 
mixtures, liniments, ointments, and 
plasters. Its active principle, atro- 
pine, is used in eye ointments and 
washes. 



FIRST AID TO THE INJURED 



643 



Treatment. — Give emetics, stimu- 
lants, apply warmth to extremities 
and mustard plaster to feet. If in- 
sensible, use artificial respiration. 

Foxglove (Digitalis). — Give emet- 
ics, strong tea, apply mustard plaster 
over the heart and calves of the legs, 
and give stimulants. 

Phosphorus. — Poisoning frequently 
occurs as the result of sucking or 
swallowing the heads of matches. 

Treatment. — Give emetics, followed 
by magnesia, white of egg, and olive 
oil. 

Zinc. — Bicarbonate of soda (bak- 
ing soda) in water, milk, eggs, strong- 
tea, or warm drinks. 

Tartar Emetic (Antimony or Stib- 
ium). — Give warm water freely, and 
stimulants, strong tea, or coffee. Ap- 
ply heat. 

Corrosive Sublimate (Bichloride of 
Mercury). — This substance is used in 
solution and tablet form for disinfec- 
tion as a surgical antiseptic, etc. It 
is a highly active and dangerous 
poison. 

Treatment. — If seen immediately 
after swallowing, give an emetic; also 
at once abundant doses of white of 
egg, milk, mucilage; or mix up an 
arrowroot gruel, barley water, or 
flour and water, and give all that the 
patient will swallow. 

Lead (Red Lead, Sugar Lead, 
White Lead, Paints). — These poisons 
cause cramps, paralysis, convulsions, 
giddiness, stupor. 

Cause vomiting, give large doses of 
Epsom or Glauber salts, apply mus- 
tard plaster to extremities, and give 
stimulating drinks. In acute attacks 
of lead colic the same treatment may 
be pursued, except to omit the vomit- 
ing. 

Prussic Acid, a violent poison, is 
sometimes taken by children in eat- 
ing the pits of stone fruits or bitter 
almonds, which contain it. The anti- 
dote is to empty the stomach by an 
emetic and give water of ammonia. 
Apply cold water all over the body, 
followed by warm-hand friction. Ap- 
ply a bottle of smelling salts to the 
nose, dash cold water on the face, 
and give stimulants, as whisky, 
etc. 



Vegetable Poisons. — Known or un- 
known herbs such as hellebore, bitter- 
sweet, poke berries, hemlock, James- 
town weed, tobacco, etc. The most 
of these cause vomiting, intoxication, 
stupor, etc. It is a safe rule to cause 
vomiting, give warm drinks, and 
stimulants. 

Iodine or Iodoform. — Give freely 
starch or flour mixed in water, chalk, 
magnesia, and stimulants, if neces- 
sary. 

Blue Vitriol, Blue Stone (Sulphate 
of Copper). — Copper poisoning, due 
to substances which have been cooked 
in copper vessels. Give large drinks 
of warm water, emetic; raw eggs, 
milk, stimulants. 

Nux Vomica (Strychnine). — Strong 
tea, animal charcoal, inhalations of 
chloroform or ether, artificial respira- 
tion. 

Aconite. — This drug is commonly 
found in liniments and ointments. 
Give emetics; use stimulants, am- 
monia, and brandy; apply warmth to 
extremities; mustard plaster over 
heart and calves of legs. If uncon- 
scious, use artificial respiration. 

Arsenic. — This is a frequent cause 
of poisoning. It is found in insect 
powders, rat poison, and Paris green, 
and is also used in coloring wall pa- 
per and artificial flowers. 

Give emetics promptly; large 
amounts of magnesia, lime scraped 
from the walls or ceilings, castor oil, 
sweet oil, or equal parts of sweet oil 
and limewater, or limewater alone, 
raw eggs, milk, stimulants. 

Dialyzed iron may be obtained at 
nearly every drug store. This is a 
prompt and perfect antidote to ar- 
senic. 

Another class of poisons is known 
as the Irritating Gases — carbonic 
acid, chlorine, nitrous acid, and hy- 
drochloric acid. To overcome the ef- 
fect from these gases provide plenty 
of fresh air, inhalations of ammonia, 
ether, the vapor of hot water, or if 
handy inhale amyl nitrate or nitro- 
glycerin. Produce artificial respira- 
tion if unconscious. 

Note. — Poison ivy, snake bite, etc., 
are treated under " Poisonous 
Wounds."

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



FAINTING 

Loss of consciousness often causes 
considerable alarm, and, in fact, 
should not be treated as a light mat- 
ter, because it may be a preliminary 
to a grave illness. 

The first thing to discover in the 
case of insensibility is the cause. No- 
tice the surroundings. The condition 
may be due to a fall, fright, loss of 
blood, drunkenness, or poisoning. 
Convulsions would suggest epileptic 
fits, hysteria, or kidney disease. If, 
however, the cause of the injury is 
known, then a systematic examina- 
tion of the body should be made. 
The presence of a wound or bruise 
or bleeding would throw light upon 
the cause. Examine the eyes. If 
they are sensitive to the touch, brain 
injuries may be eliminated. If the 
pupils are contracted, it is indicative 
of opium poisoning, while unequal 
contraction is a sign of brain lesions. 
If the face be drawTi to one side, it 
would suggest paralysis. A bloated 
face or the odor of liquor would be 
the sign of intoxication. 

Treatment. — Lay the patient on his 
back. If the face is white and blood- 
less, have his head lower than his 
bodJ^ Let him have plenty of fresh 
air. Loosen the clothing. Apply 
cold water to the face. This in most 
cases will bring a return to conscious- 
ness. Aromatic spirits of ammonia is 
a good thing to use as a smelling salts 
and to give internally when conscious- 
ness returns. 

The above treatment is applicable 
in all cases of simple fainting due to 
weakness, mental emotions, and close, 
warm atmosphere of crowds. 

In the event of fainting from shock 
following an accident, there may be 
more marked symptoms, such as cold- 
ness of the skin, dilation of the pu- 
pils, and weak heart action. 

In addition to the above treatment, 
the skin should be rubbed briskly, 
bleeding, if any, controlled, wounds 
dressed, and broken bones bound up. 
Hot-water bottles, flatirons, or plates 
should be applied to the extremities. 
Hot coffee is a good stimulant. 

The temperament of the injured 
person is an important factor in de- 



termining the amount of shock. 
Some people go into hysterics over a 
very simple thing. I have known 
people to faint at the very sight of 
blood. One experience comes to ray 
mind of a young lady who was the 
sweetheart of a member of a volunteer 
regiment. He had violated some rule 
of the regiment and was placed in the 
guard-house for twenty-four hours as 
a penalty. The young lady was told 
of the circumstance, and was so over- 
come that she fell in a dead faint. 
She was picked up from the street 
and carried into a store. Seizing a 
glass of water from the counter in 
the store, I soaked a handkerchief in 
it and applied it to her face. She im- 
mediately revived. She seemed com- 
posed for a time, but suddenly she 
seemed overwhelmed with the terrible 
thought that her lover was impris- 
oned behind iron bars imjustly, and 
that she would not be able to see him 
nor hear his familiar voice for twenty- 
four long hours. She ran down the 
street toward the armory, but fell in 
a dead faint in the middle of the car 
tracks. I rushed out, and dragged 
her from in front of a rapidly ap- 
proaching car. Again I applied the 
wet cloth, and she immediately re- 
vived. This time I held on to her 
wrist and gave her a good talking to. 
This proved a very effective means of 
treatment. 

Stunning. — A condition of the 
mind extending from bewilderment to 
insensibility, due to shaking of the 
brain by sudden violence. Concussion 
of the brain. Pilcher mentions three 
varieties : 

(1) Slight Stunning, — After a blow 
or fall, the patient is confused and 
pale, and the pulse weak for a few 
moments. Treatment: Rest, lying 
down, and apply wet cloth to head. 

{•2) Moderate Stunning. — Patient 
insensible and immovable, skin cold, 
pulse weak, eyes closed, pupils con- 
tracted. May be aroused, but returns 
to unconsciousness. Then comes a 
period of returning consciousness 
and restlessness; vomiting often oc- 
curs on return to consciousness. 
Treatment: Rest, lying down, quiet 
of body. Apply heat to feet and 
lower part of body, and cold to head. 



FIRST AID TO THE INJURED 



645 



(3) Severe Stunning. — Serious. 
Patient cannot be aroused. Pulse 
very weak and irregular. Skin cold 
and clammy. Recovery is very slow, 
and death often occurs. Liability to 
excessive reaction and complication of 
congestion of the brain. 

No stimulants of any kind are to 
be given where the brain is affected. 

In all cases of complete shock, such 
as may come from those cases men- 
tioned in this and other articles, and 
in cases of apoplexy and compression 
of brain, the treatment outlined 
above should be pursued. The pa- 
tient must be kept quiet, placed in a 
comfortable position, the head kept 
cool, and the extremities warm. This 
to be done until the physician ar- 
rives, who should be called immedi- 
ately. 

Insensibility from Sunstroke. — The 
attack is usually preceded by giddi- 
ness, weakness, and nausea; eyes 
bloodshot and contracted; skin hot 
and dry; subject unconscious, breath- 
ing quick and loud ; heart rapid and 
tumultuous. 

Treatment. — Place patient on back 
in a cool place with head raised. The 
chief object is to reduce his excessive 
heat. Remove clothing, pour cold 
water all over the body. Pilcher says 
to hold the vessel four or five feet 
above the patient and pour first on the 
head, then on the chest and abdomen, 
and then on the extremities, and to 
repeat until conscious. Bags of 
cracked ice may be applied to the 
head and under armpits. The patient 
should be wra^jped in cold sheets or 
placed in a tub containing cold water. 
Continue until patient is conscious or 
the heat greatly diminished. Repeat 
if symptoms return. 

In prostration from excessive heat 
— not sunstroke — place the patient 
on his back, with his head on a level 
with his body and loosen clothing. 
Apply heat to the surface of the body 
and extremities. Bathe the face with 
warm water into which a little alcohol 
or whisky has been poured. In pros- 
tration from drinking too much ice 
water when overheated, loosen cloth- 
ing, place on back with head slightly 
elevated, give hot drinks, apply heat 
to the spine and extremities. Don't 



give any alcoholic stimulants. Tea, 
coffee, or warm milk may be used. 

In exhaustion from lieat due to hard 
work and confinement in close, hot at- 
mosphere, cover the body with 
blankets and ajjply heat to the ex- 
tremities. Send for a physician. 

Electricity Accidents. — Proceed 
as follows: (1) Shut off the current 
or release the injured person from 
contact with it. (i2) Don't touch the 
person aft'ected or the live wire with 
the bare hands. If rubber shoes and 
gloves can be secured, well and good. 
Stand on a dry board and cover the 
hands with woolen cloths or paper. 
If a tool of any kind is used, it 
should have a wooden handle. 

After shutting oft' the current, lay 
the patient down, keep him warm, and 
apply artificial respiration. 

Lightning^ Accidents. — To prevent 
accident: (1) Avoid standing under 
trees to escape from the rain during 
a thunder storm, but boldly expose 
yourself to the wet; it will preserve 
you from the lightning. {-2) Avoid 
standing close to any metallic bodies, 
as lead pipes or iron railings, etc. 
(3) When indoors during a thunder 
storm, sit or stand as near to the 
middle of the room as convenient. 
Avoid standing at the window or sit- 
ting near the wall. 

HOW TO TREAT A BRUISE OR 
SPRAIN 

A bruise is a wound under the skin 
and is usually caused by blows, falls, 
squeezes, or pinches. Bruises are 
often referred to as black-and-blue 
spots. The part affected swells, then 
changes color, at first red, then blue, 
fading out to a greenish brown, and, 
lastly, to a dirty yellow. Severe 
cases may be accompanied by synij)- 
toms of shock. Where the case is 
severe, treatment should be admin- 
istered by a physician. 

The best treatment, in my judg- 
ment, is the application of hot water 
to the parts. While it is true tliat 
very cold and hot water act pretty 
much the same, yet my experience in 
the treatment of bruises has led me 
to have greater faith in hot water. 
It relieves the soreness, contracts the 



646 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



blood vessels, assists in carrying off 
the collected venous blood, and di- 
minishes the inflammation. 

Just a word about the proper way 
to apply the hot water. Most per- 
sons, as a rule, apply a towel wrung 
out in hot water; when it cools, they 
remove it, leaving tlie part exposed 
while they are renewing the towel. 
This is not the most effective way, as 
the wound is chilled between appli- 
cations. 

The way to get the best results is 
to have two or three towels in service. 
While one is applied to the wound, 
the other is made ready; the removal 
of the one being followed immedi- 
ately by the application of the other. 
In this way the hot water is kept on 
the bruised parts continuously, giv- 
ing the best results. 

The next step is absolute rest. The 
part should be bandaged in such a 
way that it is kept absolutely quiet. 
Frequent bathing with tincture of 
arnica, camphor, and witch-hazel will 
assist in reducing the swelling and 
promoting absorption. 

^\^lere the bruise involves a large 
area, or has been severe, the softer 
tissues may be seriously involved, and 
in such cases surgical interference is 
necessary. 

The above treatment pertains to the 
bruise with which we have to deal 
most frequently. The same treatment 
is applicable in most cases of sprain, 
except the bandaging occupies a more 
important place. The foot should be 
immersed in a bucket of hot water 
and more hot water added from time 
to time, so that it can be kept as hot 
as can be borne for fifteen or twentj'^ 
minutes, after which a firm bandage 
should be applied and the foot ele- 
vated. 

In sprains of the wrist, a straight 
piece of wood should be used as a 
splint, covered with cotton or wool to 
make it soft, and lightly bandaged and 
the arm carried in a sling. 

BULLET WOUNDS 

Treat as other wounds. Do not 
probe for the bullet. Usually there 
is considerable shock accompanying 
the accident. In severe cases apply 



warm blankets and heat to the ex- 
tremities and spine by means of hot 
irons or hot bottles. Hot drinks 
should be given. It seems needless to 
suggest that a surgeon should be sent 
for immediately. 

TREATMENT OF SPECIAL PARTS 

Rupture of Varicose Veins. — Ele- 
vate the limb, loosen garters, and ap- 
ply bandage below the wound and also 
over it. Blood clots help to stop the 
bleeding and should not be re- 
moved. 

Bleeding of Hand, Wrist, or Arm. 
— Elevate the arm. In arterial bleed- 
ing, make pressure on the inner side 
of the arm, midway between the elbow 
and the armpit. 

Forearm. — Raise the forearm above 
the head. In addition to the pressure 
on the wound or above it, place a 
hard pad, such as a small bottle or 
stick, in the front of the elbow, then 
bend the forearm at the elbow 
and bandage firmly to the upper 
arm. 

Fingers. — Pressure may be made 
at the wrist by using a rubber band. 
If a single finger is affected, a band 
on the finger, close to the hand, will 
suffice. 

Palm of Hand. — A hard, round 
object, like a billiard ball or a hard 
apple covered with gauze, grasped 
tightly in the hand will prove ef- 
fective in stopping the hemorrhage. 
The hand can be bound down upon 
the ball. 

Armpit. — Pack the armpit with a 
hard substance, such as a rolled or 
knotted towel, and then press the arm 
upon it; or if the latter is severed, 
bind the material tight to parts by 
running a bandage about the body or 
shoulder. Pressure should be made 
upon the artery which lies back of the 
collar bone. 

Thigh and Legs. — In bleeding of 
the lower limb, pressure should be 
made on the inner side of the thigh 
near the groin, over the femoral ar- 
tery. This can easily be found. 
Pressure can be made by the fingers, 
elastic bands, or tourniquet. Remem- 
ber always that such pressure must 
not be kept on too long. 



FIRST AID TO THE INJURED 



647 



Bleeding below the knee can also 
be arrested by placing a stick back 
of the knee and doubling the leg 
back upon it tightly, binding it with 
a bandage. 

Elevation of the leg assists in over- 
coming the blood flow in all wounds 
of the lower leg. 

Nosebleed. — Packing the nose with 
gauze usually is effective in severe 
cases. If bleeding continues, summon 
a surgeon. 

Internal Bleeding. — Apply iced 
cloths to abdomen. Have the patient 
lie quietly. If faint, lower head. If 
bleeding is from lungs or stomach, 
give lumps of ice and apply iced 
cloths to chest or stomach. In ac- 
cidents, bleeding from tongue or cut 
lips may sometimes deceive one, and 
it may be thought to come from the 
lungs or stomach. The mouth should 
be examined carefully. It seems 
needless to remind one that in internal 
bleeding a surgeon should be sent for 
at once. 

Bleeding of Neck and Face. — 
Bleeding of the neck is very danger- 
ous, as it is near the large trunk blood 
vessels. Pressure with the thuilib 
should be made at the base of the 
neck, outside the windpipe and near 
the collar bone. Make the pressure 
against the spine. For bleeding of 
the face, pressure can be made under- 
neath the lower jawbone. A little 
notch can be found about midway be- 
tween the chin and back part of the 
jaw, on its lower portion, through 
which this artery passes and which 
supplies the face. Pressure on it 
shuts off the supply. 

Bleeding of the Temple can be 
readilj"^ suppressed by pressure on the 
temporal artery, which can readily 
be seen on the outer side of the fore- 
head. 

Scalp. — Bleeding of the scalp can 
easily be stopped, usually by di- 
rect pressure upon the bleeding 
point. 

Chest and Abdomen. — All that can 
be done is to apply direct pressure 
by means of a large supply of gauze, 
holding it there with the hand until 
surgical help comes, or possibly bind- 
ing it on the wound by running the 
bandage about the body. 



CUTS AND SCRATCHES 

For ordinary cuts and scratches 
precaution should be taken to wash 
the part with an antiseptic solution. 
It is good to have collodion in the 
house, or handy, and apply to such 
abrasions, thus excluding dirt and 
making a bandage needless. 

POISONED WOUNDS 

Insect Bites. — For mosquito bites, 
stings from gnats, wasps, bees, and 
spiders, ammonia is the best treat- 
ment. Oil may follow, or the parts 
washed in salt water. Baking soda 
dissolved in warm water is also good. 
The sting should be removed. Ben- 
zine is said to be good for bites of 
harvest bugs. Camphor is a good 
preventive of bug and gnat bites. 

Snake Bite. — Act quickly. When 
bitten by a snake the first thing to 
do is to prevent the poison from get- 
ting into the general circulation. 
This can be done by immediately 
sucking the wound. Precaution must 
be used in seeing that the mouth is 
not sore or the poison swallowed. 
Shut off the circulation from the part 
by bandaging the limb — if such it be 
— tightly, or if in another part, by 
pressure over the vein. Open the 
wound with a knife blade and let the 
blood flow freely, and squeeze the 
poison out. Some advise use of a 
cupping glass. Wash the wound with 
an antiseptic. If a caustic can be 
had, burn out the woimd with it. 
This can be done also with a hot iron. 
Keep the bandage on several hours, 
and when releasing it do so gradu- 
ally. 

Whisky is recommended as a stim- 
ulant. 

Dog Bite. — The same treatment as 
used for snake bite can be used for 
dog bite. People frequently get very 
much excited over a bite from a dog. 
Hydrophobia is rare. I would advise, 
if the dog shows no signs of being 
mad, that it be not killed, but penned 
up and watched. This will, if the 
dog is normal, relieve the patient and 
his friends from anxiety. Later 
when the patient's condition is abso- 
lutely known, such measures may be 
taken with the dog as may assure the 



648 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



protection of society. In cities where 
antihydropliobia serum is provided, 
this may be used as a pieventive 
measure. 

All animal and rodent bites should 
receive the same attention as has been 
recommended for dog bites. 

POISON IVY AND POISON OAK 

Sumac, Etc. — When poisoned from 
these plants an irritating rash ap- 
pears and is frequently accompanied 
by a painful swelling of the parts 
affected. A strong solution of bak- 
ing soda is good. Zinc ointment is 
also recommended, or in the absence 
of these plain vaseline is good. Sev- 
eral authorities recommend bathing 
the parts two or three times a day 
with sweet spirits of niter. 

Foreign Bodies in the Nose. — Blow 
the nose hard while holding the oppo- 
site nostril closed. Excite sneezing by 
tickling the nose or by giving snuff. 
Instruct the patient to take a full 
breath and close the mouth, then give 
a sharp blow in the back between the 
shoulders. The best way to remove 
a foreign body is with a syringe, but 
this should be done by an experienced 
physician. 

Foreign Bodies in the Throat. — 
An obstruction can generally be car- 
ried down by swallowing pieces of 
bread or potato slightly masticated, 
or, better still, a raw egg, fresh from 
the shell and with its original con- 
sistency broken as little as possible. 
Slapping on the back sometimes helps. 
Sometimes the obstruction will go 
down too far to be reached by the 
fingers. In such cases copious 
draughts of water should be swal- 
lowed rapidly, and if this fails to re- 
move it, give mustard water, or any 
other emetic. Should vomiting fail to 
bring up the obstruction, then me- 
chanical means must be tried. Take 
a long spoon, bend it slightly, make 
the patient throw his head well back, 
and push the handle boldly down the 
the throat. If it is kept well to the 
back of the throat no harm can be 
done. The same operation may more 
conveniently be performed by a bit 
of sponge attached to a bit of whale- 
bone. Occasionally, substances will 



get into such a position in the throat 
as to necessitate a surgical opera- 
tion. 

BURNS 

Burns are caused by contact with 
fire, the rays of the sun, very hot 
bodies, or chemicals. Pilcher divides 
them into three classes, according to 
their degree of severity: (1) Mere 
painful redness; {3) formation of 
bUsters; (3) charring. In severe 
burns there may be considerable de- 
struction of tissue and great shock. 

To treat a burn: first remove the 
clothing by cutting it away with a 
pair of scissors. If it sticks, do not 
pull it off, but flood it with oil. 

If blisters are present, let the water 
out by pricking them with a needle 
after passing it through a flame to 
sterilize it. Take care not to break 
the blisters, so as to avoid exposing 
the tender surface to the air. 

Promptly exclude the air by apply- 
ing a compress wet with water, in 
which is dissolved a liberal amount of 
baking soda. Apply any oil, such as 
olive oil, sweet oil, fresh lard, unsalted 
butter, vaseline, etc. One of the best 
oils to use is a solution of equal parts 
of linseed oil and limewater. 

In the absence of oil, dust boric 
acid over it or apply clay. Cover the 
wound with cotton or some soft ma- 
terial. If the wound is wet, always 
see to it that oil has been used freely 
before using cotton, as when dry the 
latter will stick and reopen the 
burned surface when an attempt is 
made to remove it. 

Burns caused by acids should be 
thoroughly washed with water, then 
with a solution of baking soda and 
water, and then treated like an ordi- 
nary burn. 

Burns caused by alkalies, such as 
caustic potash, caustic soda, or am- 
monia, should be washed with vinegar 
or some other dilute acid. 

Treat shock as explained under 
" Fainting." 

Cover severe burns as quickly as 
possible, so as to exclude the air. 
An application should be ready to ap- 
ply immediately. Do not expose the 
wound, as it may prove fatal. If burn 



FIRST AID TO THE INJURED 



649 



is extensive, dress but a small portion 
at a time. 

The bicarbonate of soda and oils are 
best applied by dipping cloths into 
them, ointments by spreading on 
cloths and then applying. 

In burns of the mouth or throat, 
apply the oil or white of an egg by 
drinking them. If caused by chemi- 
cals, the mouth and throat should be 
rinsed by the proper antidote — vine- 
gar or dilute acid in case of caustic 
soda, potash, ammonia, or lye, and a 
solution of baking soda for acid burns. 

In severe burns summon physician 
at once, as there may be considerable 
destruction of tissue and danger of 
great shock. Burns often heal slowly 
and are frequently attended by fear- 
ful scars and deformity. 

Simburn is a burn of the first de- 
gree and should be treated as such. 

A person whose clothing is burn- 
ing should be made to lie down — if 
necessary, thrown down — as the 
tendency of the flames is to rise up- 
ward. When the patient is lying 
down the flames have less to feed on, 
and there is not so much danger of 
their reaching the face or inhaling the 
fumes. The person should be quickly 
wrapped in a shawl or blanket of 
wool, not cotton, and the fire 
smothered by pressing on the burning 
part. 

BLEEDING 

To be efficient in stopping a hemor- 
rhage, it is necessary to know that 
blood comes from two sources, namely, 
arteries and veins. It must also be 
remembered that blood in an artery 
comes from the heart, and that blood 
in a vein is on its way to the heart. 
Thus, in stopping the bleeding from 
an artery, pressure must be made be- 
tween the heart and the wound, while 
in bleeding from a vein pressure must 
be made on the distant side of the 
wound. 

It is not difficult to determine 
whether the bleeding is from an artery 
or a vein, as in an artery the blood 
spurts and pulsates, while blood from 
a vein oozes and flows without pulsa- 
tion m a steady stream. 

Bleeding from an artery, especially 



one of considerable size, is very seri- 
ous, and prompt efforts must be made 
to stop it. 

General Rules for Treatment. — 
Send for a physician immediately. 
Have the injured person lie down and 
elevate the wounded part. This can 
be done readily if an arm or leg is 
aflFected. Remove clothing from the 
affected part — it may be necessary 
to cut it off. Keep the patient as 
quiet as possible. Apply pressure di- 
rectly upon the bleeding point by 
pressing the finger, covered with 
gauze, upon it. If the bleeding is from 
an artery, make pressure above the 
wound, that is, between it and the 
heart. This can be done with an 
elastic band, a pair of elastic sus- 
penders, or tightly wound bandages. 
In severe cases a tourniquet must be 
used. This can be made by first 
strapping the limb with a bandage, 
making a knot in it, which should be 
placed at a point above the wound di- 
rectly over the artery supjilying the 
bleeding point. The artery can be lo- 
cated with the index finger, as its pul- 
sations can be detected. When the 
knot is made, a loop should be made 
also directly over it, through which a 
small stick can be placed. This can be 
twisted, and thus pressure is brought 
to bear upon the artery until the bleed- 
ing ceases. The bleeding point must 
be watched in the event that the flow 
may recur. Such a tourniquet must 
not be left on the arm or leg for too 
long a time. In minor wounds the 
bleeding will be arrested in 15 to 20 
minutes, when the pressure can be 
reduced. In severe cases of bleeding, 
apply cold by means of ice bandages; 
in ordinary bleeding, pressure by 
means of gauze upon the wound is 
sufficient to stop it. 

In excessive bleeding, general treat- 
ment of the patient is needful. The 
patient may faint or become very 
weak. In the latter case heat should 
be applied to the extremities and 
blankets secured. To overcome the 
fainting, see directions for this pur- 
pose. 

After the bleeding has stopped, 
treat as a wound. Apply gauze which 
has been saturated in a mild antisep- 
tic solution, then apply absorbent cot- 



650 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



ton and dress with bandages. Abso- 
lute cleanliness must be observed. 
There are some popular ideas that 
cobwebs, tobacco, and salves are good 
to stop bleeding. They should never 
be used, as they may cause blood 
poisoning. 

DISLOCATIONS 

In dislocations the patient cannot 
move the limb; there is deformity, 
shortening and pain. It is usually an 
easy matter to diagnose a dislocation, 
wliereas it is often very difficult to 
always detect a fracture. 

Treatment. — Send for a physician 
immediately, and while awaiting his 
arrival place the patient in as com- 
fortable a position as possible. Sup- 
port the injured part with pillows or 
bandages, and apply hot towels to 
the part to reduce the pain and in- 
flammation. Dislocations are not so 
serious if reduced immediately before 
inflammation has begun seriously. 
Long delay makes the work of ad- 
justment very hard, and in severe 
cases the swelling must be reduced be- 
fore the dislocation can be treated. 

Yet, while this is true, unskilled 
handling may prove very serious, and 
where it is possible to secure a sur- 
geon the dislocation had better re- 
main untouched until his arrival. 
Where, however, a surgeon cannot be 
secured for several hours, an attempt 
may be made to correct the disloca- 
tion, and a few hints are given how 
to act. 

The most common dislocation, no 
doubt, is that of the fingers. Tliis 
occurs very frequently in games of 
baseball. Often the first joint of the 
finger is thrown out of place and is 
turned upward and backward. The 
first act in the treatment is to grasp 
the tip of the finger firmly. Then in- 
crease slightly the deformity in order 
to loosen the impaction; at the same 
time press the dislocated end into 
place and pull forward firmly but not 
roughly. When reduced, it would be 
wise to use a small stick as a splint 
and bandage the finger, making it ab- 
solutely immovable. Frequent baths 
in water as hot as can be borne will 
help to soothe and heal. 



A very embarrassing dislocation is 
that of the lower jaw. This occurs 
usually in consequence of extreme 
yawning or sometimes in laughing. A 
friend of mine, an intern in a Jew- 
ish hospital, was called several times 
each week to a home for the Jewish, 
to reduce the dislocation of the lower 
jaw of an old Hebrew who had the 
happy faculty of dislocating his jaw 
at very frequent intervals and often 
at very inopportune times. We are 
surprised that this occurs as fre- 
quently as it does, but really it is still 
more remarkable that it does not oc- 
cur with greater frequency among the 
members of the opposite sex, es- 
pecially at the high-school age. 

Where such an accident occurs the 
victim is found with his mouth wide 
open, with the saliva dripping from 
its corners, and unable to speak dis- 
tinctly. 

To reduce the inflammation, wind a 
handkerchief thickly around both 
thumbs, padding them well, to avoid 
injury by the sudden closing of the 
mouth when reduced. Place the 
thumbs on each side of the lower jaw, 
inside the mouth and as far back as 
possible. Then press firmly down- 
ward and backward, when the jaw 
will be felt to slip into place. When 
in place, bandage to hold in posi- 
tion. 

FRACTURES 

Broken Bones. — A layman should 
not attempt to set a bone. For gen- 
eral purposes we recognize two kinds 
of broken bones: First, those which 
do not break through the skin and, 
second, those in which the bones do 
protrude through the skin. 

The thing to do in a fracture is 
make the injured person comfortable, 
and keep the injured part perfectly at 
rest. Handle the fractured limb very 
carefully, cut ofi" the clothing, lay the 
limb on a splint, placing enough cot- 
ton or soft material underneath the in- 
jured part to make it comfortable, 
then bandage lightly to prevent the 
edges of the bones from moving upon 
one another. 

In compound fractures, dress the 
wound and cover with gauze, cotton, 
and a bandage. 



FIRST AID TO THE INJURED 



651 



In a fractured hand the splint 
should extend from the elbow beyond 
the fingers. Remember to pad the 
splint, having a thick wad of padding 
under the pahn of the hand. Place 
the arm in a sling. 

In fracture of a finger a splint 
should be placed against the finger 
on the palmar surface and extended 
from tip of finger to the wrist. Pad 
the splint and bind to the finger, and 
support it by placing the arm in a 
sling. 

A broken wrist should have a splint 
extending well up the forearm. 

Broken Forearm. — Usually both 
bones are broken. I would advise 
placing two splints padded evenly 
with plenty of cotton, on the arm 
from elbow to tips of fingers, then 
bandage and place in sling. 

Upper Arm Fracture. — Place 
splints on each side of the arm and 
bandage to the body. If the fracture 
is high up toward the armpit, place 
a pad of folded lint in the armpit 
and extend under the arm; then bind 
the upper arm to the side of the chest 
and place the elbow in a sling. 

In fractures of the collar bone or 
shoulder blade, bring the hand up 
across the chest to the opposite shoul- 
der, and bandage the arm to the chest. 

In fracture of the ribs, if it is nec- 
essary to move the patient, strap the 
affected side with strips of adhesive 
plaster from the spine to the chest 
bone. 

In fracture of the jaw, put the 
bones in place and bind a bandage 
across the head, relieving the bones of 
all strain. All that can be done in 
fracture of the nose is to pack the 
nose with gauze and stop the bleed- 
ing. 

DROWNING 

(1) Loosen clothing, if any. (3) 
Empty lungs of water by laying the 
body on its stomach and lifting it by 
the middle so that the head hangs 



down. Jerk the body a few times. 
(3) Pull tongue forward, using hand- 
kerchief, or pin with string, if neces- 
sary. (4) Imitate motion of respiration 
by alternately compressing and ex- 
panding the lower ribs, about twenty 
times a minute. Alternately raising 
and lowering the arms from the sides 
up above the head will stimulate the 
action of the lungs. Let it be done 
gently, but persistently. (5) Apply 
warmth and friction to extremities. 
(6) By holding tongue forward, clos- 
ing the nostrils, and pressing the 
" Adam's apple " back (so as to close 
entrance to stomach), direct inflation 
may be tried. Take a deep breath and 
breathe it forcibly into the mouth of 
jiatient, compress the chest to expel 
the air, and repeat the operation. (7) 
Don't give up ! People have been 
saved after hours of patient, vigorous 
effort. (8) "WTien breathing begins, 
get patient into a warm bed, give 
warm drinks, or spirits in teaspoon- 
fuls, fresh air, and quiet. 

PRONE PRESSURE METHOD 

A new method of producing arti- 
ficial respiration has recently been 
discovered by the noted physiologist, 
Dr. E. A. Shafer. He calls it the 
" prone pressure method " because the 
patient lies at full length face down, 
and pressure is made with the hands 
of the operator on the back over the 
lower ribs and then relaxing the pres- 
sure. This is continued alternately 
about twelve times a minute. Thus 
the air is forced out and sucked in, 
making a frequent exchange of air in 
the lungs. The advantages mentioned 
for this method are that it is very effi- 
cient, is exceedingly simple, can be 
done by one person and without fa- 
tigue, and that because of the posi- 
tion of the patient allows the tongue 
to fall forward and the mucus 
and the water to escape from the 
mouth and thus not block up the 
throat. 



CHAPTER XLIII 
WHAT THE HOME NURSE OUGHT TO DO 

WHAT AN INVALID MAY EAT — WHAT AN INVALID MAY DRINK 
— ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS. 



When a rubber hot-water bag is 
not at hand, a very good substitute is 
a stone bottle with a perfect]}- tight 
coik. The hottest water can be put 
into it without fear of cracking, and 
it will retain heat the greater part of 
the night. Even a glass bottle can be 
used in an extremity; for occasionally, 
during a severe chill, a doctor orders 
hot applications put aU around the 
body, and it is impossible always to 
find enough hot-water bags to supply 
the demand. The greatest care must 
be exercised in seeing that the corks 
are perfectly tight. If the bottles are 
too hot, slip them into stocking legs, 
tying them at each end. 

Simple as the task of making poul- 
tices is, a certain knack is needed: 
Mix flaxseed with boiling water, stir- 
ring constantly with a palette knife. 
When the mixture is thick enough to 
drop from the knife, lift it from the 
fire, beat well to make it light, and 
spread, a quarter of an inch thick, 
between old soft muslin or surgeon's 
gauze. Turn over the edges, lay it 
on a hot plate, cover wath another 
plate, and carry it to the sick room 
as hot as possible. Before laying it 
on the patient, test its temperature 
by holding it against your own cheek. 
If it is too hot for you, it requires 
cooling before applying. When put 
on by degrees, as it were, letting 
down one small piece at a time, it 
will not feel as hot as if put on all 
at once. No poultice should remain 
on longer than an hour; by that time 
it is not as warm as the body. After 
removing, wipe the skin dry, and rub 
tlie sore place with oil or vaseline. 



652 



Fomentations are not easily applied, 
unless one knows exactly how to 
handle them. In every household 
which has due care for emergencies, 
there ought to be a set of fomentation 
cloths; three large ones of heavy 
blanket flannel, about three quarters 
of a yard square. These are neces- 
sary in cases of pain in the stomach 
or abdomen, or in any extended ache 
in the body. Smaller fomentation 
cloths of a thinner flannel are neces- 
sary in an attack of neuralgia, pain 
in the muscles of the neck, toothache, 
or pains about the head. These 
cloths should be about eight or ten 
inches square. Some a few inches 
smaller are handy for pain in the ears 
or eyes. The way to use a large fo- 
mentation cloth is to carry into the 
sick room on a tray a kettle of water 
which has been taken oflF at the boil- 
ing point. Fold the large cloth four 
times. Hold the ends, dipping the 
center of the cloth into the hot water, 
but keeping the ends dry. Then 
twist the flannel into a rope-like roll 
until every drop of moisture is 
squeezed out. It will be very hot, 
still almost dry. Lay this on the ach- 
ing part of the body, folding it quite 
smooth, and applying it gradually, 
keeping the hand beneath to save from 
a sudden shock of intense heat. Over 
the fomentation cloth lay a second 
square of flannel, dry and warm, to 
keep in the heat. If this is bandaged 
loosely around the body, a fomenta- 
tion cloth will retain its heat for ten 
or fifteen minutes. Pain may some- 
times be relieved with one application. 
If it continues, take the other flannel 



WHAT THE HOME NURSE OUGHT TO DO 653 



square and wring from the water in 
the same fashion. An easy way to 
wring the smaller cloths used about 
the head is to fold them into a square 
and lay in a potato ricer. Dip the 
ricer into boiling water and squeeze 
the cloth dry, covering it with an- 
other flannel to keep in the heat. 
After these squares have been used, 
launder them and lay away, ready 
for another emergency. 

A very handy thing to have in the 
sick room is a small nursery refrig- 
erator; but when it cannot be ob- 
tained, you can keep ice with small 
amount of waste by a simple, home- 
made contrivance. Get a large 
flower-pot with a saucer a size or 
two bigger than the pot. On the 
saucer set a wire trivet. Put the 
ice on this, and over it turn the 
flowerpot upside down, stopping up 
the hole in the bottom with a wad 
of absorbent cotton. Cover with a 
piece of flannel, and uncover only 
when ice is needed. The quietest 
thing to use for an ice pick is a 
strong hat pin; stick it in the ice, 
pick with a small hammer, and break 
off a piece as large as you want. 

In the summer when the range fire 
is allowed to go down and there is 
no gas stove, or where the sick room 
is some distance from the kitchen, it 
is a good plan to have some way of 
heating water in the sick room. Do 
not use a stove which burns kerosene 
or gasoline; in spite of the utmost 
care, it will exude odors. The use of 
gas is no better, as it consumes oxy- 
gen, and it is seldom that a pipe can 
be attached tightly enough to prevent 
all odor from the gas. The best ar- 
rangement is an alcohol lamp. If 
that is not in the house, you can man- 
age with a five-o'clock teakettle or a 
chafing dish, which over a hot alco- 
hol flame will boil a pint of water in 
a few minutes. 

The instructions that a doctor lays 
down about medicine, feeding, or any 
sort of treatment must be carried out 
to the letter. The best plan is to 
write his instructions concisely dur- 
ing every visit. If he orders medi- 
cine to be given every two hours, do 
not ti-ust to memory, but reckon the 



time ahead and write it down — medi- 
cine at ten, twelve, two, four, or 
whatever the case may be. Be per- 
fectly accurate in measuring, using a 
medicine dropper for drugs and the 
average-sized teaspoon for a tea- 
spoonful. 

A small clock is a necessity in the 
sick room; but frequently its ticking 
will irritate a nervous patient. The 
best way to overcome this is to cover 
it with a glass shade. In this way it 
can be seen but not heard. 

Occasionally a doctor orders an 
application of hot spirits. This is a 
process which must be very carefully 
carried out, as the alcohol is liable to 
take fire. The best way to heat it is 
to set the whisky into a cup, put in 
a chafing dish, pour hot water aroimd 
it, then put on the lid. Afterwards 
light the flame of the lamp and let 
the water boil gently for a few min- 
utes. Fold old muslin or gauze into 
the shape required, dip it in boiling 
water, and press dry in a potato 
ricer. Dip it again in hot whisky, 
squeeze as dry as possible, apply it 
as hot as can be borne, and cover 
with a piece of dry flannel. Keep 
the whisky hot as long as it is needed, 
and have two bits of muslin, so one 
can be changed while the other is on 
the patient. 

When it is necessary to change a 
nightshirt or nightgown, and the pa- 
tient is too sick to sit up in bed, draw 
it weU up under the arms, slip off a 
sleeve at a time, and push it up to- 
ward the neck, getting it over the 
head as deftly as possible. Roll the 
skirt of the fresh nightdress into a 
coil till it reaches the sleeve, slip the 
patient's arm into the sleeve before 
lifting the head from the piUow, and 
the nightdress can then be pulled 
down over the neck very quickly, aft- 
erwards straightening the skirt. The 
easiest plan in severe sickness is to 
have a nightdress which is open all 
the way down the front. It can be 
easily changed by turning the patient 
on one side and adjusting the night- 
dress from head to foot, then doing 
the same on the other side. 

The patient's hair should be combed 
twice a day at least. If it is a 



654 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



woman's, part it in the middle and 
back, brush and comb one side at a 
time, and make it into two neat 
braids. 

When a patient is allowed to sit up 
for the first time, it is a good idea 
to make it half an hour at meal time. 
It is much easier to eat when in a 
comfortable, upright position, as the 
food tray can then be put in a more 
convenient place. Besides, the nov- 
elty of being able to sit up and eat 
is apt to create a new relish for food. 
If it can be obtained, a handy thing 
to have in a sick room is a one-leg 
adjustable table, which can be set 
high or low, as needed, and be used 
for various needs — to serve a meal 
on, to place the basin on, for the pa- 
tient to wash his face and hands, or 
during convalescence to hold a book 
or for a game of solitaire. Although 
it is not quite as handy, a good sub- 
stitute for this useful bit of furniture 
is an ordinary sewing table. Unfold 
two legs, set it on the floor beside 
the bed, leaving the other legs tucked 
under. To prevent the weight of the 
table from resting upon the patient's 
body, put a couple of props under it 
on the bed. If nothing else is handy, 
a few books or wooden blocks will 
serve to keep it steady. 

Occasionally, the doctor orders an 
ice compress for the head. To make 
it, fold two large handkerchiefs (to 
be used alternately) so they will not 
be so wide as to come over the eyes 
or wet the hair or pillows, and turn in 
the edges. Put a block of ice with 
a little water about it in a basin, 
wring out a handkerchief and lay it 
on the ice until very cold; then apply, 
keeping one on ice, the other on the 
patient's head. 

Occasionally, a room is situated so 
that it is almost impossible to let the 
air sweep through it as it ought with- 
out blowing on the patient. Arrange 
a little tent by placing around the 
invalid a low clotheshorse with three 
panels. Over this spread a sheet or 
blanket. If the air is very cold, put 
a hot bottle at the feet and cover the 
lower part of the body with extra 
clothing. In this way there will be no 
danger of the patient catching cold. 



The Medicine Closet. — Even in the 
household where every member is 
strong and healthy, there ought to be 
in reserve all sorts of simple medi- 
cines and emergency requirements, 
which are ready at the moment 
needed. The medicine closet should 
be high enough to be out of the reach 
of children's hands. If made of 
wood, enamel it white inside and out, 
thus making it very easy to keep 
clean. Put a secure lock on the door 
and keep the key where it can be 
found instantly by any one in the 
household. Divide the shelves into 
different departments for all sorts of 
needs. In one side store everything 
that is poisonous, or in any way dan- 
gerous. In another, keep rolls of an- 
tiseptic gauze, absorbent cotton, ster- 
ilized linen, bags for poultices, lint, 
surgeon's plaster, finger stalls, rubber 
bandages, and court-plaster. Reserve 
one shelf for such common, everyday 
remedies as calomel, camphor, cas- 
tor oil, cascara sagrada, Epsora 
salts, Jamaica ginger, glycerin, pare- 
goric, ipecac, limewater, magnesia, 
sweet spirits of niter, oil of pepper- 
mint, quinine, rhubarb, senna, sul- 
phonal, flowers of sulphur. Upon 
another keep such drugs as are used 
for cleansing wounds or bruises and 
healing burns, also things to be used 
in cases of emergencj', as alcohol, bo- 
racic acid, alum, carbolic acid, arnica, 
borax, charcoal, collodion, witch-hazel, 
iodoform, turpentine, dioxygen, lis- 
terine, and peroxide. There ought to 
be a corner for poultice and plaster 
necessities. There one would find 
mustard, flaxseed, oil silk, bran, lin- 
seed meal, and antiphlogistine. Here, 
too, have small supplies kept together 
of such things as might have to be 
looked for in different parts of the 
house: carbonate of soda, ammonia, 
whisky and brandy, olive oil, sweet 
oil, camphorated oil, limewater, and 
oil liniment. 

Save every morsel of old linen as 
it comes from the laundry, for emer- 
gencies. Cut it into strips two to 
three inches wide and join them, lay- 
ing 6nc end upon the other, and sew- 
ing around the edge. Cut off ravel- 
ings, then begin at one end and roll 



WHAT THE HOME NURSE OUGHT TO DO 655 



up. Make as many of these rolls as 
will go into a wide-mouthed fruit jar. 
Fill the top with absorbent cotton, 
set the jar upon a trivet in a kettle 
of cold water deep enough to have 
the water come nearly to the neck, 
and allow it to come almost to the 
boiling point. The jar will need a 
weight laid across the top to hold it 
steady. Keep the water about 180° 
F. for three hours. Lift off the kettle, 
and let stand until water becomes 
cold. Then take the jar out, screw 
on the top tightly, wipe, and put 
away. The linen will then be so per- 
fectly sterilized that in using it there 
will be no possible danger of infect- 
ing a fresh wound. Save old pocket 
handkerchiefs and bits of soft linen 
and lawn for poultice bags, making 
them of different sizes — some as large 
as an eight-inch square, others just 
big enough to poultice a boil. Stitch 
them around three sides on the ma- 
chine, then they can be tied tightly at 
tlie neck. When thej'^ are wanted fill 
the bag half full of whatever the 
poultice is made of and press it into 
shape between the palms. When 
poulticing a boil, lay over it first a 
scrap of thin sterilized linen moist- 
ened with olive oil and on top of 
that place the hot poultice. When 
poultices must be applied very hot, 
fill three bags and keep them in the 
oven, where two can be kept as hot 
as possible. After putting the poul- 
tice on, cover with several folds of 
old flannel, which helps to retain the 
heat. In making mustard plasters, 
mix with the white of an egg instead 
of water, as it has all the drawing 
power necessary, yet it never blisters 
the skin. Use half mustard and half 
flour, then cover the top of the plaster 
with thin old linen. 

The Sick Room. — Perfect ventila- 
tion, a sunny exposure, and, if pos- 
sible, a fireplace, which has much to 
do with keeping the air pure, are 
necessary for the sick room; which 
should be kept perfectly neat and 
clean in every detail. A bare floor 
with a few small rugs, which can be 
taken up and shaken, is very much 
better than a carpet, or even matting. 
A string mop, used noiselessly about 



the floor, carries away all the dirt 
without raising dust. The bed should 
be placed so the patient can be shut 
off from any draughts, also in a po- 
sition that will not allow the sun or a 
gas light to glare in his eyes. A 
single bed is far better than a double 
one, for various reasons. The best 
frame is of iron or brass with a 
woven wire or national spring, both 
of which can readily be kept clean 
and free from dust. It ought to be 
set on strong, noiseless casters, so it 
can be moved quietly and easily when- 
ever necessary. The higher the bed 
the better, as it is much easier for a 
nurse to lift a helpless patient when 
not obliged to bend very low. If 
obliged to use a double bed, try to 
have the patient sleep on one side 
during the day, leaving the other side 
comfortable for night. A good hair 
or felt mattress is a necessity, and 
it ought to be in one piece, as steady 
use of a divided mattress is liable to 
make it slip around and become very 
uncomfortable. Cotton sheets are su- 
perior to linen, even in summer, when 
coolness is desired, because cotton is 
not a quick producer of heat, and it 
does not absorb perspiration, as linen 
does, afterwards chilling the body. 
Wool blankets, light or warm, ac- 
cording to the season of the year, are 
much better than a comfortable. A 
dimity covering or linen sheet is more 
comfortable than a heavy Marseilles 
counterpane. The pillows are better 
thin and narrow than thick and 
square. 

The furniture of a sick room should 
be as simple as possible; all heavy 
draperies and upholstered chairs be- 
ing removed. Thin muslin curtains 
add to the cheerfulness, and a dark 
shade, if there are no outside shut- 
ters, is almost a necessity during 
long summer days, when the chamber 
has to be darkened during sleeping 
hours. A small table that is steady 
on its legs and light enough to be 
easily lifted, is a necessary article of 
furniture. Do not allow it, however, 
to get piled up with all sorts of use- 
less things. Keep it covered with a 
clean towel and reserve it for the 
necessary articles which should be 



656 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



found there: the thermometer in its 
glass of borax water, a pad and 
pencil, which may be needed during 
the doctor's visit, and a movable hand 
screen, to use on occasions when the 
patient wishes to be shaded from the 
light. A small night lamp, which 
burns with a dull glow, is frequently 
a necessity. If sick nursing has to 
be done during cold weather, when 
artificial heat is necessary, try to al- 
leviate the dryness of the atmosphere. 
This can be done by keeping a basin 
of water upon the radiator, or setting 
before the register a three-fold screen 
of cheese cloth, which should be kept 
constantly wet. A light screen is an- 
other sick-room necessity. The best 
is one of plain bamboo, which does not 
hold dust, the panels made of some 
washable stuff run on rods, so they 
can be quickly changed for laundei-- 
ing. If possible, have no plumbing 
fixtures in a sick room, and when it 
opens into a bath room keep the ad- 
joining door closed as much as pos- 
sible. 

An excellent way to admit fresh air 
to a sick room in winter, when a win- 
dow is near the bed, is to open it the 
desired height, then stretch a piece of 
cheese cloth over the opening and 
tack it fast. A still more convenient 
way is to put the cheese cloth on a 
small frame that will fit into this 
opening; it can then be removed at 
any time, 

A valuable remedy for proud flesh, 
an obstinate outgrowth of flesh from 
small sores, consists of alum. A lump 
of alum is placed upon a stove just 
hot enough to enable it to turn to 
dry powder. The powder placed on 
tlie affected part repeatedly and cov- 
ered with a bandage can be relied 
upon to effect a speedy and inex- 
pensive cure. It has never failed to 
cure when even the services of a 
physician were vainly resorted to. 

Another good remedy: use pow- 
dered resin. Apply as above; do not 
heat the resin, however. 

If there is an invalid in the family 
who must be fanned, have your 
" handy man " make wooden handles 
for several large palm-leaf fans. 
These should be longer than the stem 



handles, nicely polished, and nearly 
as large as that of a broom. The 
center of the stick is hollowed, then 
the stem of the fan is inserted and 
fastened firmly with glue. These 
handles may be made at home by 
using the hollow end of a window- 
shade roller. The wooden handle, on 
account of its size, does not cramp 
the hand as does the small stem. 

All winter, keep in the medicine 
closet a small jar of turpentine and 
lard, melted together in equal quanti- 
ties. If one shows signs of hoarse- 
ness, give the neck and chest a vig- 
orous rubbing with this homemade 
liniment. 

For jammed fingers, immerse the 
hand in water as hot as can be borne 
and rub vigorously. Do up in sweet 
oil or vaseline. If the bruise is on 
the face, apply a cloth wrung from 
hot water, to prevent the blood from 
settling; afterwards apply the oil. 

A cure for eczema is to take yellow 
carrots, scrape them, and fry slowly 
in fresh lard till brown. Drain off 
the lard and melt in it 1 table- 
spoonful of powdered resin. Stir 
well, put in a jar, and when it is cool 
mix in 1 teaspoonfui of sulphur. Ap- 
ply each day; the cure will be speedy. 

Castor oil will not be objectionable 
to children if put in a bottle with an 
equal quantity of pure glycerin, 
heated and shaken well. Each drop 
of oil will be coated with glycerin and 
rendered almost tasteless. 

WHAT AN INVALID MAY EAT 

Sick-room diets are classified as 
liquid, light, and convalescent. The 
first consists wholly of liquid food, 
and is given in cases of typhoid fever 
and other severe illnesses. In ty- 
phoid, nothing is allowed for some 
time except milk, but during the run 
of other diseases gruels, beef tea, and 
broths are prescribed to keep up the 
strength. In fevers, a large number 
of cooling drinks, characterized as 
acid, starchy, or albuminous, are fre- 
quently ordered. Cocoa, hot milk, 
and various malt preparations are 
given at night to produce sleep, while 
occasionally doctors prescribe drinks 



WHAT THE HOME NURSE OUGHT TO DO 657 



containing rum, sherry, or brandy, 
when tlie patient is in need of such 
stimulation. 

A " light diet " is the term used for 
the food that is given when a patient 
who has been very sick is beginning 
to improve. It includes almost every- 
thing that is found in the liquid diet, 
and, in addition, soft-boiled eggs, 
soups, broths, raw oysters, toast, del- 
icate cream soups, chicken broth, soft 
custard, fruit, gelatines, light pud- 
dings, and a small amount of poultry, 
game, or tender meat. 

Convalescent diet includes all the 
dishes which have been already spoken 
of, only as the patient grows stronger 
the amount grows a little larger day 
by day, and includes more nourishing 
foods, with a larger variety. Baked 
potatoes begin to appear on the tray, 
beefsteak, broiled mutton chops, 
sweetbreads, broiled chicken, sponge 
cake, boiled rice, small pieces of 
broiled fresh fish, a slice of tender 
rare roast beef, and ice cream. 

The utmost daintiness is a neces- 
sity when a tray for the sick room is 
being set. Food that is tempting in 
appearance will often create an ap- 
petite where none existed. You must 
remember that an invalid's recovery 
depends as much upon the diet as 
upon medicine. Therefore, every- 
thing that is taken into the sick room 
must be of the best quality — eggs 
that are really fresh laid, the best of 
butter, the tenderest chicken and 
meats, and milk that is perfectly 
sweet. If the physician orders food 
served every three hours, carry the 
tray into the room on the stroke of 
the hour. He knows when the stom- 
ach requires nutrition, and unless you 
have been sick you can never under- 
stand what a terrible sinking sensa- 
tion the patient experiences when the 
lunch hour is forgotten for even fif- 
teen minutes. By making each menu 
just a little different from the one 
before, you can keep your invalid 
guessing. Anticipation creates appe- 
tite. If the tiny meal is delicately 
cooked and daintilj' served, it will 
probably be eaten with a relish. Never 
offer a sick person as much as is re- 
quired by a healthy appetite. 



For the most nourishing kind of 
beef tea, choose a piece of meat from 
the lower part of the round. There 
is more juice in a piece of the animal 
which has been toughened by steady 
exercise than in a very tender cut. 
If we wish to keep in the juices, the 
meat should be seared on the outside 
by exposing it to a strong heat, as in 
roasting, broiling, or boiling, but in 
this case the fiber should be rejected. 

Free from fat, put through the 
finest knife of the meat chopper, and 
cover with a pint of cold water. 
Heat slowly in a double boiler. In 
two hours the juices will be drawn 
out and the fiber left bleached white. 
A square of wet cheese cloth may be 
doubled and spread over a strainer, 
and through this the chopped meat be 
wrung perfectly dry. The juice 
ought to be red. If it cooks long it 
will turn brown; then the albumen, 
which we wish to preserve in liquid 
form, would coagulate, taking from 
the beef tea most of its nutrition. 
If the patient objects to the un- 
cooked look of beef tea, serve in a 
red tumbler which is well heated, be- 
cause the liquid cannot be brought to 
the boiling point. 

Occasionally, a patient is found who 
has such an aversion to milk that he 
will not take it as a liquid. Then 
try to include it in the menu in every 
possible form, that is, if the doctor 
prescribes it. It can be prepared as 
junket and clabbered milk; in cus- 
tards, oyster and cream soups, egg- 
nog, gruels, milk toast, cocoa, and 
blanc mange; in the shape of cream 
served with cereals and soft puddings, 
and if chilled foods are allowed, give 
ice cream. 

Kumiss, for which a recipe is given 
in another chapter, is very nutritious 
and easily assimilated. In fact, it can 
be retained by a stomach which re- 
fuses almost every other sort of 
nourishment. It is invaluable in dis- 
eases where the patient is badly ema- 
ciated, and in dyspepsia, chronic 
vomiting, and diarrhea it is especially 
useful. If given the last thing at 
night to any one suffering from in- 
somnia, it often produces sleep. The 
recipe given in another chapter makes 



658 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



enough for a four-days' supply, and 
if it is to be steadily used, it ought 
to be made fresh every three or four 
days, as it will not keep longer. 

Scraped Beef. — Tack down to a 
meat board with a couple of skewers 
i jiound of steak cut from the top 
of the round. With a sharp knife 
scrape it and lift off all the meaty 
substance, laying it on a platter. 
When one side is scraped bare, turn 
over and get all that is possible off 
the other side; when finished there 
will be nothing left but tough fiber. 
Mold the scraped meat with a knife 
into a little cake, and broil it over 
the coals for a few minutes. Season 
with pepper and salt, and serve on 
buttered toast. 

Chicken Broth. — Cut up a small 
fowl, wash it thoroughly, and skin it; 
also cut away all the fat possible. 
Pour over it a quart of cold water, 
set it back far enough on the stove 
to take at least half an hour to come 
to a boil. Simmer very gently. 
When the meat begins to get tender, 
lift it out, strip it off the bones, and 
put the carcass back to simmer until 
aU the good is out of it. Allow the 
soup to cool, and skim off the fat. 
Reheat, when needed, with a little rice, 
and serve quite hot. A nourishing 
veal soup may be made from a shank 
of veal in the same way. 

Creamed Toast. — Two slices of 
bread; 3 cupful of rice milk; ^ table- 
spoonful of butter; 1 teaspoonful of 
cornstarch; dash of salt. 

Toast the bread a delicate brown 
and butter slightly. Scald the milk, 
thicken slightly with cornstarch, sea- 
son with salt, and pour over the toast. 
A very tasty dish of toast may be 
made from ^ cupful of clam juice, 
taken fresh from steamed clams, and 
poured without thickening over toast. 

Broiled Oysters. — Choose the larg- 
est oysters possible, pour a little 
water over them, and rinse in the 
liquor before lifting out; then drain 
in a napkin till dry. Dip into melted 
butter, then into cracker crumbs 
which have been seasoned with pepper 
and salt, and lay them between the 
wires of an oyster broiler. Move 
gently over a clear, hot fire imtil the 



juice begins to run out. Lay them 
on toast and serve hot. 

Creamed Oysters. — i pint of 
oysters; 1 tablespoonful of butter; IJ 
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch; pepper 
and salt; 1 cupful of thin cream. 

Put the oysters in a bowl, add a 
little water, and rinse carefully, lift- 
ing each one out separately. Dry in 
a napkin. Make the cream, butter, 
and cornstarch into a smooth sauce, 
season with pejjper and salt and drop 
in the oysters. Cook until they begin 
to curl up at the edges, then pour 
over buttered toast. 

Scalloped Oysters (Individual por- 
tion), i cupful of oysters; i cupful 
of cracker and bread crumbs mixed; 1 
tablespoonful of butter; pepper and 
salt; 1 tablespoonful of cream; 1 
tablespoonful of strained oyster 
liquor. 

Wash the oysters and lift them 
from the liquor. Mix the crumbs 
with the melted butter ; scatter a layer 
of crumbs over a deep saucer; then 
a layer of oysters; sprinkle with salt 
and pepper, and cover with the rest of 
the crumbs. Pour over the cream and 
oyster liquor. Bake until the top is 
delicately browned. Serve hot. 

Broiled Squab. — Singe a squab, 
wash, and wipe dry; then, with a 
sharp knife split it down the back 
from the neck to the tail. Lay it 
open and clean the inside; cut through 
at the joints, releasing the tendons. 
Brush over inside and out with melted 
butter, season with pepper and salt, 
and dust with flour. Broil over a hot 
fire ten minutes. Serve on hot but- 
tered toast and garnish the little dish 
prettily with parsley. Quail or any 
small bird may be cooked in the same 
way. 

Broiled Chicken. — Prepare a tender 
chicken in the same fashion as di- 
rected for squab. Unless it is exceed- 
ingly small, half a portion will be 
enough to cook for an invalid; and if 
the appetite is only equal to very 
dainty meals, the tender little breast 
may be sufficient. Season with pep- 
per and salt, brush with melted but- 
ter, put in a greased broiler, and cook 
for twenty minutes, turning the 
broiler frequently. Keep the flesh 



WHAT THE HOME NURSE OUGHT TO DO 659 



side longer over the coals than the 
bony portion. When the chicken is 
delicately browned, put it in a pan 
and set in a hot oven for ten or twelve 
minutes. Serve hot with toast. 

Creamed Chicken. — i cupful of 
thin cream; i tablespoonful of corn- 
starch; 1 tablespoonful of butter; 
pepper and salt; | cupful of cold 
chicken breast. 

Make a white sauce from the cream, 
cornstarch, butter, and seasoning. 
Cut the chicken into cubes, and heat 
in the sauce. Serve on buttered 
toast with a baked potato. The meat 
which is taken from the bones when 
preparing chicken broth may be util- 
ized for this dish; or, if desired, and 
if the patient can digest it, it can be 
made into a chicken salad. 

Broiled Sweetbreads. — Before 
sweetbreads are prepared in any way, 
they have to be parboiled. When they 
come from the market, put them into 
ice water and let them stand an hour, 
then drop in boiling salted water to 
which a tablespoonful of lemon juice 
has been added. This preserves the 
white color of the sweetbread, and 
keeps the flesh firm. After cooking 
slowly for twenty minutes, drop them 
in ice water and pull off the skin, 
fiber, and all waste scraps, divide 
into pieces, and they are ready to 
serve as desired. They make a very 
savory dish for the invalid's tray when 
broiled. Do not separate them when 
cooking this way, but cut in slices, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, brush 
with melted butter, and broil a deli- 
cate brown. Season with pepper, salt, 
and lemon juice, and, if the doctor al- 
lows it, a tablespoonful of tomato 
sauce. 

Sweetbreads are delicious when 
creamed. When served in this way 
they are simply reheated in a white 
sauce, as directed for creamed chicken, 
and poured over buttered toast. If 
you have a small portion left of both 
chicken and sweetbread, it makes a 
delicious dish blended with cream 
sauce. They are also nice reheated in 
a cup of strong chicken stock with a 
dash of lemon juice for seasoning. 

Golden-rod Eggs. — Prepare a white 
sauce as given in the recipe for 



creamed chicken. Add to it the white 
of a hard-boiled egg, chopped. Pour 
the mixture over a slice of toast, and 
on top scatter the hard-boiled yolk 
rubbed into tiny strings through a 
sieve. Serve very hot. 

Egg Sandwiches. — Boil an egg 
hard and chop fine; add salt, mus- 
tard, a few drops of vinegar, and a 
dash of pepper for seasoning. Soften 
i tablespoonful of butter, beat to a 
cream, and mix the egg with it till it 
is a paste. Butter slices of bread, 
spread on the mixture, and make into 
a sandwich. 

French Chops. — Trim from the 
bones of tender, little lamb chops all 
the fat and skin, leaving nothing but 
the tiny round of meat at the end. 
Brush with butter, dust with pepper 
and salt, and broil over a hot fire. 
Slip little paper frills on the bones, 
and serve with a spoon of green peas. 
A delicious way to cook chops for an 
invalid is to broil them inside paper 
cases. Make an envelope of thick 
glazed note paper and rub it with 
butter. Slip the chop inside. Fold 
the paper so there are two sheets cov- 
ering the meat, put the little case be- 
tween the wires of the broiler and 
move about over a clear, hot fire. If 
it is turned quickly and often, there 
will be no danger of the paper tak- 
ing fire. A chop ought to cook in 
this fashion in five or eight minutes. 
It is constantly basted in the butter 
and its own juices, and is very sweet 
and tender. Turn out onto a hot 
plate, being careful that all the gravy 
is saved. Chicken or birds may be 
cooked in the same fashion. 

Creamed Asparagus. — Wash a few 
stalks of asparagus and cut off the 
white part. Divide the tender green 
portion into pieces an inch long. Cook 
in boiling salted water until tender. 
Arrange on a piece of buttered toast, 
seasoning with pepper and salt, and 
pour a little melted butter over it. If 
the invalid desires, a few tablespoon- 
fuls of white sauce may be used in- 
stead of the butter. 

Gum-gluten Biscuits. — 1 cupful of 
self-raising gum gluten; dash of salt; 
1 tablespoonful of butter; milk. 

Sift the dry ingredients, rub the 



660 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



butter into the flour, and add enough 
milk to make a soft dough. Roll it 
out, cut into little biscuits, and bake 
quickly. 

Bran Muffins. — 1 cujjful of flour; 
2 cupfuls of bran; 1 teaspoonful of 
soda; 3 tablespoonfuls of molasses; 4 
tablespoonfuls of butter; U cupfuls 
of sour milk; dash of salt. 

Mix the dry ingredients, rub the 
butter between the fingers, add the 
molasses and sour milk; beat hard for 
five minutes. Pour into greased, hot 
pop-over irons, and bake in a quick 
oven. 

Raw-beef Sandwiches. — Meat is 
often served in this fashion to a pa- 
tient whose stomach will not retain 
it when cooked. Take about -2 table- 
spoonfuls of the raw meat prepared 
as described in scraped beef, season 
lightly with pepper and salt, spread it 
between two slices of buttered bread, 
and toast the outside delicately. Be 
careful not to allow the meat to reach 
tlie edges of the bread or it may 
nauseate the patient. 

Oyster Broth. — 1 pint of oysters ; 
1 cupful of cold water. 

Mince the oysters fine, put in cold 
water and let simmer for fifteen min- 
utes over a slow fire; skim, strain, 
and season. 

Clam Broth. — 6 clams; 1 cupful of 
boiling water; 1 teaspoonful of pow- 
dered cracker; 1 teaspoonful of but- 
ter. 

Let clams stand in boiling water 
until the shells open; drain off the 
liquor, add cracker, butter, and sea- 
soning. 

Tapioca. — 2 tablespoonfuls of min- 
ute tapicoa; 1* cupfuls of boiling wa- 
ter; 1 cupful of cold water. 

Cover tapioca with cold water and 
let soak ten minutes; put into boiling 
water and boil until clear; sweeten, 
and add nutmeg or wine, if desired. 

Junket. — i cupful of milk; a few 
drops of vanilla; ^ tablespoonful of 
sugar; i junket tablet; grating of 
nutmeg. 

Heat the milk till lukewarm, add 
vanilla, sugar, and tablet, which has 
been dissolved in a teaspoonful of 
water. Mix well, pour into a sherbet 
cup, cover, and stand in a warm place 



till the mixture jellies. Grate nutmeg 
over tlie top, and keep in a cold place 
till ready to use. 

Invalid's Ice Cream. — i cupful of 
cream, i cupful of milk; lA tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar; i teaspoonful vanilla. 

Mix ingredients in a baking-powder 
tin. Put on cover, set can in a pail 
or dish and surround with crushed 
ice and salt. Turn the can around 
often, occasionally take off the cover, 
scrape the cream from the sides as 
it freezes, and beat it well. When 
frozen, pour off the brine, beat cream 
with a spoon, pack it evenly in the 
can, and put on the cover. Let stand 
till ready to serve. Put more ice 
around the can if needed. 

Lemon Ice. — J cupful of water; i

WHAT AN INVAIID MAY DRINK 

Irish-moss Lemonade. — 2 cupfuls 
of boiling water; ^ cupful of Irish 
moss; i cupful of lemon juice; 3 table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. 

Soak the Irish moss over night, then 
pick it over very carefully. It is gen- 
erally full of sand and all sorts of 
foreign matter, and can never be made 
palatable unless it has been through a 
number of waters. When clean, put 
it in a double boiler, pour boiling 
water over it, and let it steep until 
dissolved. Strain through a square 
of cheese cloth, then add the lemon 
juice and sugar. Serve very hot. 
This is one of the most soothing 
drinks to give a patient who is suffer- 
ing from a sore throat or lung trouble. 

Grape Water. — ^ cupful of boiling 
water; 4 tablespoonfuls of grape 
jelly; J cupful of cold water; 1 tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice; 1 table- 
spoonful of sugar.

and stir until dissolved. Then add 
the cold water, sugar, and lemon 
juice, and a piece of ice sufficient to 
chill it thoroughly. Another delicious 
drink may be made in the same way 
from red-currant jelly. Blackberry, 
barberry, and black-currant jelly are 
also excellent for this refreshing 
drink.

cook for three hours. It ought to be 
reduced one half and be as thick as 
cream. Season with salt, and, if the 
patient likes it, a little sugar. Pour 
through a fine strainer, and drink 
hot. 

Oatmeal Gruel. — i cupful of oat- 
meal; 1 quart of cold water; 1 tea-

an hour and a half. Rub through a 
sieve, grate a scraping of nutmeg over 
it, and, if desired, put a tablespoonful 
of whipped cream on top. Serve hot 
or cold. 

ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS 

Elsewhere in this book are many 
foods and drinks of which a conva- 
lescent may partake. Instead of re- 
peating again the recipes which have 
Jbeen already given, one may easily re- 
fer to the index. In the chapter on 
beverages are cocoa, afternoon choco- 
late, frozen punch, lime punch, rasp- 
berry and currant punch, raspberry 
vinegar, egg lemonade, black-currant 
cup, fruit cup, currant punch and 
fruit beverage. 

Among soups are foimd a number 
of recipes for this light and nutri- 
tious form of food for an invalid. 
While a convalescent is trying to gain 
strength, it is possible that the doctor 
may order soup for him every day. 
Among some best suited for such a 
diet is consomme, tomato soups, mut- 
ton, Du Barry, veal, chicken, cream 
of corn, cream of celery, asparagus 
cream, clam, Scotch mutton broth, 
and oyster soups. 

From the egg chapter one may 
choose eggs soft boiled, steamed, 
baked, egg nest, poached, shirred, 
poached in milk, eggs in ramequins, or 
any of the delicious omelets. 

Until convalescents are well ad- 
vanced, a doctor allows few vege- 
tables, except, perhaps, a baked po- 
toto or cream asparagus. Later come 



such food as carrots, green peas, 
spinach, or some of the wheat pastes, 
such as macaroni or spaghetti cooked 
in a cream sauce. 

Although for some time after an ill- 
ness toast is the bread usually served 
on an invalid's tray, a variety of 
breads takes its place during con- 
valescence. Entire-wheat bread is 
considered nourishing for certain dis- 
eases, gum gluten bread is often 
rigidly adhered to, or a bread made 
of bran. Then Boston brown bread, 
cornmeal gems, popovers, and baking- 
powder biscuits are allowed as the 
stomach grows stronger. 

It is some time after a sickness be- 
fore salads take their place as a diet, 
then usually the crisp green things 
are served with a French dressing in- 
stead of mayonnaise. Where a may- 
onnaise is desired, the boiled dress- 
ing, blended with an equal quantity 
of whipped cream, often proves quite 
digestible. Among these salads may 
be numbered chicken salad, Waldorf 
salad, sweetbread-and-tomato salad, 
and salads made from hard-boiled 
eggs. 

When one comes to desserts, there 
are an endless variety of delicious 
things which an invalid enjoys be- 
sides the few given in this chapter. 
Among them may be enumerated 
boiled and baked custards, chocolate 
custard, caramel custard, souffles, 
fruit whips, meringues, all sorts of 
junkets, blanc mange, boiled rice, 
plain rice pudding, tapioca cream, 
fruit tapiocas, plain bread pudding, 
chocolate bread pudding, cracker pud- 
ding, and almost any of the delicate 
desserts made from gelatin. Sponge 
cake is allowed, and sometimes a plain 
gingerbread, while ice cream of the 
plainer sort, fruit sherbets, and fruit 
ices are allowable. 

Gruels are more tempting to the 
sick if whipped to a froth with an egg 
beater before serving in a pretty cup. 

Beef tea is wanted frequently when 
there is little time to prepare it. It 
can be made quickly in the following 
manner: take a lean piece of beef, 
run it through a food cutter, using 
the finest cutter; cover with cold 
water and set at the back part of the

range to heat. Do not let it boil, as 
that coagulates the albumen. Stir 
thoroughly, strain, and squeeze dry in 
a potato masher. This will extract all 
the juice of the beef quickly and 
easily. 



As a " pick-me-up," nothing is more 
nourishing than the white of a fresh 
egg beaten to a froth, slightly sweet- 
ened, and blended with the juice of a 
sweet orange. 



CHAPTER XLIV 
THE TOILET AND BATH 

THE SKIN — BATHS AND BATHING — KINDS OF BATHS — THE 
TOILET — THE HANDS — MANICURING 



THE SKIN 

The Human Skin has two principal 
functions: to protect the body, and 
to remove, by perspiration, the prod- 
ucts of certain bodily changes. The 
skin consists of two layers, as may 
be clearly seen when blisters form. 
The upper layer or outer skin shows 
a tendency to form cells of a horny 
substance, such appendages as the 



tflHrrnii 




" The Anatomy of the Skin." 

hair, nails, and corns being a con- 
tinuation of this process. These 
horny substances have the property 
of absorbing a certain amount of 
water. This softens them and causes 
them to swell. It is well known that 
the skin becomes soft by immersion 
in a hot bath or by having the hands 
for a considerable time in suds or 
dishwater, and that this softening ex- 
tends to the nails, corns, and calluses. 
After a warm bath a considerable 



665 



quantity of the horny scales of the 
skin can be removed by the use of 
a rough towel. Nails, corns, and the 
like when wet can be readily cut or 
scraped off. A considerable amoimt 
of water remains in the skin after 
bathing, and unless care is exercised 
it tends by rapid evaporation to re- 
move heat and to cause colds. But 
normally a certain amount of water 
should remain in the skin, and if too 
much of this evaporates, the skin 
chaps and cracks. 

The permanent color of the skin 
is due to certain pigment granules 
found in its inner layer. The tran- 
sient red color, as in blushing, de- 
pends upon the amount of blood in 
the blood vessels and the thickness 
of the epidermis or outer skin, most 
of the blood vessels themselves lying 
in the inner skin. 

The skin contains sweat glands 
which secrete perspiration, and seba- 
ceous glands, which secrete a fatty 
substance that tends to keep the skin 
smooth and to prevent it from drying 
by too great evaporation. This fatty 
substance also gives the hair its nat- 
ural gloss. Obstruction of the sweat 
glands gives rise to pimples, black- 
heads, and the like. These are the 
principal facts regarding the anat- 
omy of the skin, which should be un- 
derstood by those who seek to im- 
prove its appearance. 

There is a direct and reciprocal 
action between the conditon of the 
skin and the general bodily health. 
The two watchwords in the campaign 
for the preservation or improvement 
of the complexion are, therefore, 



666 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



cleanliness and hygiene. Plenty of 
outdoor exercise, good ventilation, a 
well-regulated appetite, and a cheer- 
ful habit of mind are essential. As 
to diet, an excess of butter, fat meat, 
and greasy food should be avoided. 
All stimulants, as coffee, tea, wine, 
and spirits, should be given up or 
used with great moderation. Fruit 
and vegetables should be the staples 
of diet; sweets, cake, and pastry, and 
also pickles and acid foods, should be 
dispensed with. If these instructions, 
with those given under baths and 
bathing, are followed until they be- 
come the habits of a lifetime, the 
bloom of youth can be preserved far 
into old age. 

Hardening the Skin. — The power 
of the skin to adjust itself to changes 
in temperature varies greatly. It 
can be increased by measures which 
improve the circulation of the blood, 
as nourishment and exercise; also 
by what is sometimes called the 
" hardening process." The skin may 
be hardened by living an out-of-door 
life, wearing light but sufficient cloth- 
ing with woolen next the body, sleep- 
ing with open windows but avoiding 
draughts, and taking daily baths, first 
with warm, afterwards with cold 
water. These steps should be taken 
gradually, and increased in severity 
as the body becomes accustomed to 
them. 

Nervous persons, especially chil- 
dren, may be overstimulated by these 
measures, which may thus lead to 
lifelong nervous difficulties. The dan- 
ger is minimized by giving the warm 
bath first. Cold baths alone should 
not be taken except by persons of 
strong constitution. The air bath in 
various temperatures and currents 
of air is also a valuable means of 
hardening the skin. This hardening 
process tends to prevent colds and 
their consequences. 

Diesases of the Skin. — No general 
treatment can be suggested that will 
apply to all diseases of the skin. 
Eruptions and rashes are often 
symptomatic of diseases of the blood 
and other grave conditions. When a 
strange eruption suddenly appears 
on the skin a physician should, as a 
rule, be promptly consulted. There 



are, however, a number of common 
disease conditions which yield to sim- 
ple remedies. Among these are tan, 
sunburn, freckles, moth patches, pim- 
ples, blackheads or flesh worms, moles, 
etc. 

Blackheads or " Flesh Worms." — 
The fatty substance which exudes 
from the sebaceous glands of the 
skin, if not removed by washing, 
sometimes hardens and corks up the 
gland itself. As the gland continues 
to secrete this substance it accumu- 
lates and causes a hard lump or 
swelling. When these blackheads are 
numerous they become very unsightly. 
The best treatment is to press out 
the contents between the fingers or 
press the hollow end of a watch key 
over each speck. The entrance to 
these glands is in spiral form like 
a corkscrew. Hence the contents 
when pressed out have a vermiform 
appearance, and are supposed by 
many to be small animal creatures, 
hence called " flesh worms," but this 
is not the case. 

A warm face bath twice a day, and 
gentle friction from a soft towel, as 
above directed, is the best preventive 
and remedy for this condition. Spe- 
cifics for blackheads are the sulphate 
of zinc or of copper, or common pot- 
ash properly diluted. 

To use, mix 20 grains of sulphate 
of zinc or copper in 1 pint of dis- 
tilled water or rose water, or mix I 
dram of fluid potash with 1 ounce of 
oil of sweet almonds. Then add 6 
ounces of pure soft water. First 
press out the contents of the black- 
head, rub with a rough towel, and 
apply this lotion with a camel's-hair 
brush or soft rag. 

Freckles. — Freckles are discolora- 
tions formed in the deeper layers of 
the skin by the action of sunlight. 
Hence to affect them directly it is 
necessary to work through the outer 
layers of the skin with a remedy that 
will change the deposits of coloring 
matter. Freckles, accordingly, offer 
great resistance and are not amena- 
ble to ordinary treatment. Some au- 
thorities are of the opinion that in- 
digestion may result in a deposit of 
carbonaceous or fatty matter beneath 
the skin, which, when acted upon 



THE TOILET AND BATM 



667 



by sunlight, will produce freckles. 
Hence, as a preventive, attention 
should be paid to diet and exercise 
to promote the normal secretions. 
The skin should be kept scrupulously 
clean by daily bathing, and the ac- 
tivity of the pores should be pro- 
moted by friction with a coarse 
towel. These methods are safer than 
the use of astringents or mineral 
emulsions, and the latter should never 
be employed without the advice of a 
competent physician. The only cer- 
tain preventive is the wearing of a 
brown veil whenever the complexion 
is exposed to sunlight. 

Moth Patches. — Apply a solution 
of common baking soda to the patches 
with a soft rag or camel's-hair brush 
several times a day for two or three 
days. Allow this to dry on. This 
treatment is usually sufBcient. After- 
wards cleanse the face with a bran 
bath and the skin will usually be 
found clear and brilliant. 

Or keep alum at hand and rub oc- 
casionally on the moth patches. This 
will usually cause them to disap- 
pear. 

M,oles. — Depilatories advertised for 
sale for the removal of moles are 
dangerous and their use is not rec- 
ommended. They frequently continue 
eating into the flesh until an ulcer is 
formed, and occasionally blood poi- 
son sets in. Some moles are of the 
nature of tumors, and too much care 
cannot be exercised in treating them. 
Concentrated acetic acid applied by 
means of a hair pencil will some- 
times do the work. If this succeeds 
once it can be used again, but it will 
not prevent the blemish from return- 
ing. Care must be taken that the 
acid does not extend to surrounding 
parts. 

Moles can sometimes be destroyed 
by the use of a burning glass. The 
patient must take his place in the 
clear, strong sunlight, and focus the 
burning glass on the aflfected part 
for about five minutes at a time 
daily, until the mole has been de- 
stroyed. Needless to say, this is a 
painful process, but it cannot be re- 
garded as dangerous. 

The electric needle in the hands of 
a competent physician is a thoroughly 



safe and reliable method of treat- 
ment. 

Pimples. — The immediate cause of 
pimples is usually an excess of fatty 
matter in the skin. They are very 
common in young persons from four- 
teen to twenty years of age. They 
are often caused by constitutional 
conditions, and when very numerous 
are often persistent until the general 
health is restored. Exercise, atten- 
tion to the diet, and general hygienic 
measures are recommended. A warm 
face bath with a heaping teaspoonful 
of borax in the water will be found 
helpful. 

Or bathe the face often with a lo- 
tion consisting of one tablespoonful of 
carbolic acid in one pint of rosewater 
but take care that this does not get 
into the eyes. 

Scars. — Little scars are often left 
on the face after eruptions. A 
course of electric massage treatment 
soon effaces them. For home treat- 
ment, every night applj to the face a 
cold compress, keeping it on until 
the flesh becomes pink, then anoint 
the little spots with ointment of zinc 
oxide. 

Ointment for Wrinkles or Relaxed 
Skin. — To 10 grains of camphor add 
2 ounces of prepared lard and 1 
fluid dram of rectified spirits of 
wine. Apply a little of the ointment 
at night, previously washing the face, 
and strengthen the body by means of 
tonics and nourishing diet. 

Or bathe the parts where the wrin- 
kles appear with alum and water. 
This will tighten the skin. 

Or fresh butter, 3 drams; essence 
of turpentine, 2 drams; mastic, 1 
dram. 

BATHS AND BATHING 

Historians say that the civilization 
of a community can be estimated by 
the quantity of soap it uses. Sim- 
ilarly the refinement of a family is 
indicated by the amount of water it 
consumes. 

Records of cities show that the 
amount used each day on an average 
by each person runs from seven or 
eight gallons among the poor, where 
there is only one faucet in the house. 



668 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



lo about sixty gallons in the homes 
of wealthy persons. The average of 
an ordinary family in cities may be 
taken as about twenty gallons daily 
for each member. More water is 
used in the summer than in the win- 
ter — which is an argument in favor 
of a bathroom, even where there is 
no furnace in the house. About ten 
barrels of water would be required 
every day on this basis by a family 
of ten persons. 

The human skin contains millions 
of pores. The business of these pores 
is to bring to the surface the waste 
materials of the body, which other- 
wise pass off principally through the 
kidneys. If the pores become clogged 
by the accumulation of eifete matter 
they are xmable to fulfill their proper 
functions, and the kidneys are 
obliged to do extra work, which may 
bring on chronic diseases of those or- 
gans. 

Colds are caused by lack of proper 
contraction of the pores of the skin 
when the body is exposed from 
draughts or otherwise. As a result 
the blood is cooled too rapidly and 
has a tendency to chill and congest 
the internal organs, as the mucous 
surfaces of the head and nose, and 
also of the alimentary canal, the kid- 
neys, etc. The resulting symptoms 
show in acute form the bad effects 
of neglect of bathing. In fact, fre- 
quent bathing is almost a sure pre- 
ventive of colds. If the pores are 
kept clean they are active, and resist 
the chills which tend to produce cold. 
If they are not kept clean they are 
sluggish and inactive, and in no con- 
dition to offer normal resistance to 
sudden changes in temperature. 

Certain portions of the body, as the 
armpits, the feet, and the groin, have 
many more pores to the square inch 
than the rest; hence these perspire 
more freely and should be cleansed 
often. The feet especially should be 
very frequently washed. There is no 
better practice from the health stand- 
point than a daily footbath. 

The Bathroom.-^ Bathrooms are no 
longer a novelty in small towns and 
farmhouses. But it must be under- 
stood that to enjoy these in winter, 
requires almost of necessity a range 



or furnace. Pipes in kitchens may be 
kept warm by stoves, and bathrooms 
adjoining the kitchen may be warmed 
by leaving the door open between 
or the bathroom may be over the 
kitchen, and a drum or sraokepipe 
from the kitchen stove arranged so 
as to heat the pipes in the bathroom. 
But it is usually better not to have 
running water in the bathroom in 
winter until a furnace is put in. It 
pays, however, to partition off a 
bathroom near the kitchen and put 
in a bath tub, If there is running 
water or a hand pump in the bath- 
room, with drainpipes to carry away 
waste — even if it is necessary to carry 
cold water to the tub from the kitchen 
sink and hot water from the stove in 
pails. A good bath tub is not a lux- 
ury, but a necessity to comfort, clean- 
liness, and health. 

If the bathroom is near the kitchen, 
the tub can be filled by bringing hot 
and cold water in pails; and if the 
tub is elevated slightly, the water can 
be drawn off in pails and carried to 
the drain after the bath; or, if a tub 
is used which does not have a faucet 
for drainage, the waste water can be 
easily removed by using a small piece 
of rubber tube as a siphon, or by a 
dipper and large bath sponge. Every 
household should be provided with a 
full-size tub, even if it is only of tin. 
Portable rubber tubs which can be 
folded and put away when not in use 
are also obtainable. But a cast-iron 
tub is preferable and not too expen- 
sive. 

The entire cost of plumbing for a 
bathroom, including supply pijie, hot- 
water pipe, and all necessary fixtures, 
provided jou have a water supply in 
the house, will not exceed $150. This 
sum can be reduced bj^ doing some 
of the work yourself. 

Even if there is no furnace, the 
bathroom can be used from early 
spring to late fall, and especially 
through the summer season, when it 
is aliove all essential to health and 
comfort. Every family should make 
the necessary sacrifices to put in and 
enjoy this great convenience. 

To Paint an Iron Bath Tub. — Mix 
the paint to a proper consistency 
with best coachmaker's japan var- 



THE TOILET AND BATH

nish. For white-lead paint, use half 
turpentine and half coachmaker's 
japan. It will not darken much. 
Venetian red is best for a first coat 
for any color but white. 

Temperature of the Bath. — The 
temperature of the bath for cleanli- 
ness should be about 95° F. A cold 
shower bath or douche to follow the 
warm bath should be about 77° F. 
A cool bath should be about 77° F., 
but the temperature at the start may 
be lowered for those who are accus- 
tomed to it. 

The water for a person in ordinary 
health should be drawn about as hot 
as is agreeable; but care should be 
taken not to remain too long in a 
hot bath. This applies especially to 
persons who are thin-blooded, ner- 
vous, or neuralgic. After the body 
has been thoroughly cleansed, it is a 
good idea to gradually introduce cold 
water into the tub until a perceptible 
chill is felt. 

If there is running water in the 
bathroom, a shower bath may be had 
by obtaining the detachable rubber 
tubes and fixtures used for this pur- 
pose, which come very cheap. The 
shower bath is the best means of 
cooling the body after a hot bath. 
When this is done, or after a cold 
bath, a reaction should be brought 
about by a vigorous rubbing with a 
Turkish towel until the body is in a 
warm glow. This practice would al- 
most certainly prevent all colds and 
many fevers, with their fatal conse- 
quences. 

KINDS OF BATH 

Cold Sponge Bath. — Many persons 
make a practice of taking a cold 
sponge bath every morning, followed 
by vigorous rubbing with a coarse 
towel or flesh brush. The best method 
of doing this is to fill a washbowl 
or basin with water and let it stand 
in the room over night, so as to ac- 
quire the same temperature as the 
air in the room. Rub with the bare 
hands rather than with a cloth or 
sponge, wetting only a small portion 
of the body at a time and rubbing 
that portion until a reaction is expe- 
rienced. Washing the face and head, 



next the arms, the back, the lower 
portion of the chest, and the lower 
limbs, in the order mentioned, is a 
good rule for cold-water bathing. 
After the rub-down with a coarse 
towel, the skin should be pink, all in 
a tingle, and the whole surface of the 
body should be in a warm glow. 
Some persons cannot endure this 
regimen, although it is highly bene- 
ficial to others. A few days or weeks 
of experience will test its expediency. 
This is worth trying, because it often 
results in a life habit which is ex- 
ceedingly beneficial. Those who are 
less robust may obtain some of the 
benefits of the cold sponge bath by a 
vigorous rubbing with a towel or 
flesh brush each morning when the 
bath is not taken. When bathing in 
winter, the shock from cold water is 
lessened by standing a minute in the 
cold air after removing the clothing 
and before applying the water. 

Footbath. — This bath may be 
taken for cleansing purposes or for 
the purpose of drawing the blood 
from other parts of the body. Con- 
gestion of blood in the head may be 
relieved by a footbath in cold water. 
If convenient, the patient may walk 
for a few minutes in a brook or 
stream reaching about to the ankles. 
This may be followed by a brisk rub- 
bing and some exercise, as walking. 
Or the patient may first put his feet 
in hot water for from three to five 
minutes and then plunge them for 
half a minute into cold water. Aft- 
erwards the feet should be rubbed 
dry and the person should take ex- 
ercise by walking. 

Salt-water Bath. — Add 4 or 5 
pounds of sea salt, which can be pur- 
chased of any druggcst, to a full bath 
at the temperature of 65° F. The 
patient should remain in this bath 
from 10 to 20 minutes, and after- 
wards should rest for half an hour 
in a recumbent position. Such baths 
are useful in general debility pro- 
duced bv wasting diseases, as scrof- 
ula and other diseases of the skin, 
anaemia, etc. Sea salt should not be 
used for children. It does not pene- 
trate the skin, but acts as a stimu- 
lant. 

Mustard Bath. — The addition of 3 



670 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



or 4 tablespoonfuls of powdered 
mustard to a hot footbath in cases of 
chill is a preventive against taking 
cold, and is also useful in the early 
stages of colds to induce perspira- 
tion. The feet should be taken out 
of this bath as soon as the skin red- 
dens and begins to smart. The parts 
bathed should be carefully cleansed, 
rinsed, and wiped dry. Great care 
should be exercised in giving mustard 
baths to children, else the skin may 
become badly blistered. 

The Bran Bath. — Make a decoction 
of wheat bran by boiling 4 or 5 
pounds of wheat bran in a linen bag. 
The juice extracted, and also the 
bran itself, should be put into the 
water. This is for a full bath at a 
temperature of about 90° F. This 
bath is of service in all skin affec- 
tions accompanied by itching. 

THE TOILET 

The Complexion. — The object of 
attention to the complexion should be 
to preserve the skin in its normal con- 
dition of health, and to remove all 
abnormal effects and conditions. 
Among these may be mentioned ex- 
cessive dryness or evaporation, by 
exposure to dry and biting winds, of 
the water normally contained in the 
skin; the opposite extreme of exces- 
sive perspiration; and the obstruction 
of the pores by dirt or grime or other 
causes, which is the parent of various 
eruptions and other skin diseases. 
These subjects are taken up in turn 
in the following pages, and the prin- 
cipal standard remedies are cited. 

Many persons regard attention to 
these matters as evidence of vanity 
and light-headedness, and others go 
to the opposite extreme and give 
much more time and thought to the 
niceties of the toilet than is either 
wise or necessary. Doubtless the wise 
and sane course lies between these 
two extremes. The normal condition 
of the skin resulting in a firm, 
smooth, and soft texture and a clear 
pink-and-white complexion, not only 
contributes to personal attractiveness, 
but also to the sense of comfort, in- 
cluded in the general term " good 
health." 



Women (and men, too) have a 
natural right to a good complexion. 
The contrary is evidence of some im- 
proper or diseased condition, and it 
is perfectly natural and proper to 
seek and apply suitable remedies. 

Beauty Doctors. — On the other 
hand, we earnestly advise against the 
patronage of so-called " beauty doc- 
tors," many of whom are unquestion- 
ably quacks and charlatans, and we 
urge the use of homemade jirepara- 
tions. Many of the standard prepa- 
rations widely advertised for sale 
contain the most injurious mineral 
drugs, such, for example, as mercury, 
arsenic, lead, bismuth, etc. These are 
freely used by many " beauty doc- 
tors," and most unfortunately rec- 
ipes containing them have been pub- 
lished without caution in many books 
of household recipes which have had 
a wide circulation. All such prepa- 
rations have been carefully excluded 
from this volume. Approved recipes 
have been given which will accom- 
plish every desirable object without 
the possibility of any injurious con- 
sequences. 

Homemade Toilet Preparations. — 
Many toilet preparations advertised 
for sale contain organic substances 
which deteriorate by decaying, and in 
this condition jioison the skin. More- 
over, most proprietary articles are 
very expensive. AVe feel safe in as- 
suring the most careful and conserv- 
ative mothers that the compounding 
at home and use of any of the prep- 
arations herein recommended will be 
a perfectly safe and innocent em- 
ployment for their daughters or them- 
selves. Any disposition to do so 
should, we think, be encouraged. A 
few vials of essential oils as per- 
fumes, small quantities of almonds 
and other required ingredients, may 
be bought at the drug store for less 
than a single bottle of a proprietary 
article can be purchased, and all in- 
terested will have the satisfaction of 
knowing that the materials are fresh 
and of good quality, and that no 
harmful consequences from their use 
need be feared. 

Country Girls should have the best 
complexions in the world, but this is 
not always the case. Those who have 



THE TOILET AND BATH 



671 



not been favored by nature in this 
respect very often envy their city 
cousins' supposed advantages of easy 
access to " beauty doctors " and the 
large department stores and drug 
stores where toilet preparations of 
all sorts are for sale. The country 
girl has, in fact, a pronounced advan- 
tage over her city cousin if she has 
the wit to utilize it. Many of the 
most effective agents and remedies 
for the toilet are to be had in every 
farmhouse, and it is safe to say that 
the country girl can stock her dress- 
ing table with a full line of toilet 
preparations if she so desires, of bet- 
ter quality than her city cousin can 
purchase. And she can do so much 
more cheaply and conveniently. 

To Preserve the Complexion. — To 
prevent the excessive evaporation of 
water normally present in the skin, 
it is well to rub a small quantity 
of cold cream over the face before 
going out in the hot sun or wind. 
Just enough should be used to cover 
the surface without its being notice- 
able. In hot climates the use of 
similar preparations to prevent the 
drying of the skin is practically uni- 
versal. 

A veil is also a desirable protection 
against bad weather. Chiffon or 
other material of the finest mesh 
should be preferred. Frenchwomen 
of the middle and upper classes never 
think of going out without a veil. 
Englishwomen and the inhabitants of 
warm climates generally carry para- 
sols. 

To Wash the Face, — When the 
face is red or dry from exposure to 
sun and air, or grimed with dirt or 
smoke, it is well to put on it a quan- 
tity of cold cream and rub thor- 
oughly with a soft cloth. After the 
irritation has been somewhat less- 
ened, tlie face should be thoroughly 
washed and cleansed. Fill a basin 
two thirds full of fresh soft water. 
If your source of water supply is 
hard water, put a teaspoonful of 
powdered borax into the basin. Dip 
the face in the water, and afterwards 
the hands. Soap the hands well, and 
rub with a gentle motion over the 
face. Dip the face a second time, 
rinse thoroughly, and wipe with a 



thick, soft towel. After the bath a 
slightly astringent lotion is very re- 
freshing. 

The application of alcohol will fur- 
ther cleanse and stimulate the pores. 

The use of a good cleansing cream 
before the face bath and a suitable 
lotion afterwards has a really won- 
derful effect in improving the com- 
plexion. The effect of a clean face, 
however, is itself altogether delight- 
ful. Such a bath tends to rest and 
refresh the bather and put her in a 
good temper. Many a bad complex- 
ion is due to neglect of a proper 
cleansing process. If more faces 
were kept really clean, a great im- 
provement in the complexion would 
be noticed. 

Face Cloth. — The hands themselves, 
in the judgment of many persons, 
are the most effective means of wash- 
ing other portions of the body. To 
those who prefer face cloths we sug- 
gest scrim as the most sanitary ma- 
terial. Scrim is porous and free from 
lint, so that the air circulates through 
it freely. It is so thin that it can be 
quickly washed and dried. 

The Toilet Sponge. — The wash rag 
and the sponge, while convenient and 
regarded by many as indispensable, 
are often sources of injury to the 
skin. Children, especially, are prone 
to take a sponge from dirty water 
and squeeze it dry without ' rinsing. 
The decaying organic matter caught 
in the pores of the sponge gives rise 
to certain acids and ferments very 
injurious to the complexion. Both 
the sponge and the wash rag should 
be thoroughly cleansed and rinsed 
after use. To clean a sour sponge, 
put 1 teaspoonful each of ammonia 
and borax into a basin of warm water, 
wash the sponge, rinse in clean soft 
water and hang in the air, exposed 
to sunshine if possible, until dry. 

Toilet Soaps. — Pure soaps do not 
irritate the skin. There are two prin- 
cipal kinds of soaps: those containing 
free alkali in the form of potash or 
soda lye, and the so-called neutral or 
fatty soaps. The former increase the 
swelling and softening of the horny 
parts of the skin. When these are re- 
moved, they wf course take tlie dirt 
with them. The latter are better 



672 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



adapted to persons of sensitive skin, 
although their detergent effects are 
not so marked. Among these are 
Castile, glycerin, curd soaps, and the 
like. Medicated and highly colored 
or scented soaps should rarely be 
used, and we recommend purchasing 
for household use only well-known 
soaps which have an established repu- 
tation for purity and general satis- 
faction. It must be borne in mind 
that toilet preparations which may 
give good effects on one skin are 
sometimes injurious to another. 
Glycerin is said to burn some skins, 
and benzoin cannot be used by some 
persons. This shows how important 
it is for a woman to know what in- 
gredients are used in making up her 
toilet preparations. It is not always 
safe to " try " some compound, tlie 
contents of which are unknown, be- 
cause it is highly recommended by 
others. 

On the other hand, the difference 
in results obtained by two women 
may often be attributed to the dif- 
ference in the method of use. One 
woman will cleanse her face thor- 
oughly as above indicated, while the 
other will merely apply a cream or 
lotion when the skin may be covered 
with grime and the pores filled with 
dirt. The result may be to still fur- 
ther clog the pores and produce an 
eruption of pimples and blackheads. 
No preparation can give satisfactory 
results in the absence of absolute 
cleanliness. 

THE HAXDS 

Nothing betrays lack of daintiness 
in personal care more than neglect 
of the hands and nails. Of course 
it is more diflBcult for some women to 
keep their nails clean and their hands 
soft, white, and free from blemishes 
than for others. But in the care of 
the hands immaculate cleanliness is 
imperative. They should never be 
washed except when it can be done 
thoroughly. Constantly rinsing them 
in cold water grinds the dirt in and 
ruins the texture of the skin, making 
it rough, coarse, and red. When ex- 
posed to hard usage, as in the rou- 
tine of housework, instead of fre- 



quently washing the hands in water, 
a few drops of oil should be rubbed 
into them. They should then be 
dusted over with talcum powder and 
wiped with a coarse towel. This will 
cleanse them and protect the flesh 
from growing callous. Lemon juice 
will remove stains. 

The hands should always be washed 
in tepid wate**, and a good soap is 
an absolute necessity. It is also im- 
portant that the water be soft. 
Avoid washing the hands frequently 
with cheap laundry soap, washing 
powders, soft soap, or other powerful 
detergents. They tend to roughen, 
redden, and chap the skin. The best 
soap is none too good for the toilet. 
There are many brands on the mar- 
ket which are known to be good, and 
it is better not to experiment with 
those that are new and untried. Any 
hard, white, pure or neutral soap is 
suitable for the toilet. Hence it is 
not necessary to purchase special 
toilet soaps, which are usually expen- 
sive, however desirable they may seem 
to be. To test soap for toilet pur- 
poses, apply the tongue to it. If it 
contains free alkali, it will have a 
caustic or burning taste and should 
be avoided. Otherwise it is not likely 
to be injurious. 

In cold weather or when the hands 
are very dirty rub a little pure lard 
or cold cream over them, and after- 
wards wash them with soap and 
water in the usual way. This has a 
tendency to keep the skin from crack- 
ing or chapping. The use of gloves, 
especially when gardening, driving, or 
walking in sun or wind, helps to pre- 
serve the softness of the hands and 
keep thera clean. Sprinkling the 
hands with orris root or talcum pow- 
der before drawing on the gloves 
will counteract excessive perspira- 
tion. 

Redness and Burning. — These 
troubles are caused by defective cir- 
culation. Attention should be given 
to the general health, and as a pre- 
ventive measure the hands should 
be protected from exposure to the 
weather — especially in the winter — 
by the use of a muff or by fur-lined 
gloves. Or two pairs of gloves may 
be worn, which will be found warmer 



THE TOILET AND BATH 



673 



than one pair lined. After the hands 
have been exposed to the cold they 
may be prevented from tingling by 
washing them in very warm water, 
and drying them carefully on a soft 
towel. The after effect will be a feel- 
ing of coolness, whereas the use of 
cold water causes a glow. 

Moist Hands. — If tlie hands are 
constantly moist from too free per- 
spiration, bathe them frequently 
either in salt water, which acts as 
a stimulant or tonic, or in a solution 
of vinegar or lemon juice, which acts 
as an astringent. 

Or rub them with a mixture of 
powdered alum and tannic acid, both 
of which have astringent properties. 

Or a little of this mixture may be 
dusted inside the gloves. 

But care should be taken not to 
use acid or astringent cosmetics of- 
tener than is necessary, as they tend 
to overwork the pores of the skin 
and to produce injurious after ef- 
fects. 

To Remove Stains from the 
Hands. — Substances recommended 
for removing stains from the hands 
are lemon juice, the juice of ripe 
tomatoes, sulphuric acid (oil of 
vitriol), chloride of lime, oxalic acid, 
fumes of sulphur, and various com- 
pounds of these. The following spe- 
cial directions may be noted: 

To "Use Sulphuric Acid. — Dilute a 
few drops in 20 times its volume of 
water, and apply to stains with a 
brush. Take care this does not touch 
a cut on the flesh or fall upon fab- 
rics of woolen or cotton, as it will 
take out their color and eat holes 
in them. 

To Use Oxalic Acid. — Make a weak 
solution of oxalic acid and water, 
and apply with a brush or rag. Take 
care this does not get into any sores 
and cuts, as it will inflame tliem. On 
healthy skin its action is as mild as 
lemon juice. 

Or dampen the stain and hold it 
over the fumes of an old-fashioned 
sulphur match, freshly lighted. Or 
burn a small piece of suljihur out of 
doors and hold the stain in the fumes. 
Care must, of course, be taken not 
to burn the flesh or inhale the fumes 
of burning sulphur. 



The above are specially useful for 
fruit stains. 

To Remove Stubborn Stains. — Mix 
oxalic acid and cream of tartar in 
equal proportions. This should be 
marked " Poison," and kept out of 
the reach of children. Wet the stain 
with warm water and sprinkle with 
this preparation, rubbing until the 
stain disappears. Then wash the 
hands with soap and rinse well. This 
will remove the most stubborn ink 
and dye stains. 

To Soften the Hands. — Keep on 
the toilet stand near the soap a dish 
of oatmeal, and rub it freely on 
the hands after washing. This will 
cleanse and soften the skin. 

Or use corn meal in the same man- 
ner. 

Or keep at hand a quantity of 
clean white sand. The artificial sort, 
made by crushing quartz or flint 
stone and sold for filters, is pref- 
erable to sea sand or ordinary sand, 
since it has sharper edges. Mix a 
handful of sand with hot soapsuds, 
and wash and rub the hands with 
this mixture for several minutes. 
The sand may be cleansed by pour- 
ing fresh water over it and draining 
through a filter. It can be used 
again and again. This method sof- 
tens and removes the calluses caused 
by housework. The hands may after- 
wards be rubbed with oatmeal or 
corn meal, as above, and treated with 
cold cream or some other simple lo- 
tion. 

Or a pair of white kid gloves may 
be turned inside out and brushed 
over with cold cream or any melted 
mixture of wax, oil, lard, or other 
unguent. These gloves may then be 
drawn on the hands and worn at 
night. 

Or the hands may be rubbed at 
night with cold cream, mutton tallow, 
or honey, and a large pair of gloves 
drawn on. In the morning the hands 
should be thoroughly washed with 
some good toilet soap, and rubbed 
with oatmeal or corn meal and any 
simple lotion. The following mix- 
tures are recommended to use with 
gloves at night to soften and whiten 
the hands: 

Put in a quart glass fruit jar J

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



pound of grated or shaved castile 
soap. Pour over this i pint of alco- 
hol, and let stand in a warm place, 
shaking frequently until the soap is 
dissolved. Add 1 ounce of glycerin 
and oil of almonds, perfume with a 
few drops of any essential oil, and 
seal tightly. 

Or put A pound of grated castile 
or other hard white soap in a dou- 
ble boiler; pour over it 1 gill of olive 
oil, and dissolve with gentle heat. 
Add 1^ ounces of mutton tallow, mix 
thoroughly, remove from the fire, and 
add 2 fluid ounces of alcohol and a 
few drops of any essential oil as per- 
fume. 

Or shave together in a flat glass 
dish or on a marble slab 1 ounce of 
spermaceti, 1 ounce of white wax, and 
1 ounce of gum camphor. Mix with 
olive oil to a stiff paste. 

Or mix 1 ounce of glycerin and i 
ounce of ammonia with ^ ounce of 
rose water. 

Chapped Hands. — Substances rec- 
ommended for chapped hands may 
be distinguished as follows: solid un- 
guents, such as spermaceti and other 
forms of w^ax, lard, unsalted butter, 
mutton suet, tallow, and the like; 
liquid unguents, such as glycerin, 
yolk of egg, honey, almond oil, lin- 
seed oil, and olive oil; various sub- 
stances which have specific soothing 
properties, as borax, bitter almonds, 
bran (decoction of), balsam of fir, 
camphor, sal soda, carbolic acid, 
quince seed, raisins, oatmeal; various 
flavoring and coloring extracts and 
perfumes. 

The objects sought in using these 
substances are as follows: 

The solid and liquid ungents are 
emploj^ed to hold the specific reme- 
dial agent in suspension, and to give 
consistency to the mass so as to make 
it easier to apply them; also to pre- 
vent their speedy evaporation. The 
various remedial agents are selected 
according to their several properties 
and the results desired. These vary 
In their effects with different indi- 
viduals and also according to the con- 
dition of the skin. A little experience 
will indicate which to employ imder 
given conditions. Coloring extracts 
and perfume may, of course, be used 



according to taste. With these 
thoughts in mind it is an easy mat- 
ter to prepare a stock of emollients 
suited to one's ideas and experience, 
based upon a solid unguent if a paste 
or salve is desired, or upon a liquid 
unguent if a lotion is preferred, and 
containing such remedial agents, color- 
ing matter, etc., as are desired. 

Glycerin for the Hands. — Glycerin 
may be used pure or scented with 
any essential oil. Rub on the hands 
at night with the same motion as 
when washing them, either before or 
after the hands have been chapped, 
or apply immediately after they have 
been chilled by exposure. Soft cham- 
ois-skin gloves worn at night will 
prevent this and other preparations 
from making grease spots on bed 
linen. 

To soften and whiten the hands, 
use a mixture of two thirds glycerin 
and one third rose water. 

Or, to prepare glycerin paste for 
toilet use, put 1 ounce of any good 
transparent toilet soap in 4 ounces of 
soft water or rose water, and add 5 
ounces of glycerin. Dissolve all with 
gentle heat, stir in 20 ounces of ad- 
ditional glycerin, pour into a glass 
fruit jar, and when nearly cold per- 
fume with a few drops of any essen- 
tial oil. 

Or simmer with gentle heat in a 
double boiler 1 ounce of glycerin, 2 
ounces of olive oil, and 2 drams of 
spermaceti. Apply to the hands 
night and morning. 

Or mix 3 ounces of glycerin, 1 yolk 
of egg, and 30 grains of carbolic 
acid, and beat up to an emulsion 
with an egg beater. Rub into the 
skin several times daily. 

Or simmer 1 dram of quince seed 
in i pint of boiling water for 10 
or 15 minutes; strain out the quince 
mucilage through a piece of cheese- 
cloth, and to it add one ounce of glyc- 
erin, 1 ounce of borax, and 6 ounces 
of soft water or rose water. Apply 
to the hands two or three times a 
day. 

Bran for the Hands. — Boil a small 
quantity of bran in a linen bag. Put 
both the juice and the boiled bran in 
the washbowl, add warm or hot 
water, and wash the hands with or

without soap. This is perhaps the 
best and simplest treatment for the 
redness, dryness, and roughness 
caused by housework and exposure. 
After washing, the hands may be 
rubbed with a few drops of honey or 
a lotion composed of ^ pound of 
honey, i pound of sal soda, and 1 
pint of water. Mix well and heat 
without boiling. 

Linseed Oil for the Hands. — This 
is good for chapped hands, and also 
for burns and sprains. It has the 
advantage of being cheap and almost 
always available. 

Honey for the Hands. — This may 
be used when the skin is dry, hard, 
and rough. Moisten the hands and 
rub the honey in well. After a while 
wash them thoroughly in bran water 
or some other liquid preparation, and 
they will be perfectly clean and soft. 

Camphor for Chapped Hands. — 
Camphor cakes or balls, to prevent 
chapped hands, may be made as fol- 
lows r 

Melt 3 drams of spermaceti and 4 
drams of white wax. Add 1 ounce of 
almond oil. Moisten 3 drams of 
camphor with spirits of wine, and 
mix up all together. Run this into 
molds or make up into balls in the 
same manner as butter balls are made. 

Or, for an ointment, melt together 
gum camphor, 3 drams; beeswax, 3 
drams; olive oil, 3 ounces. Apply 
at night, and wear chamois-skin 
gloves. 

Other Remedies for Chapped 
Hands. — Mix white wax, 4 drams ; 
olive oil, 2 drams; spermaceti, 18 
grains. 

Or unsalted butter, i pound; rose 
water, 1 wineglassful; yolks of eggs, 
2; honey, 1 tablespoonful. Mix and 
stir in finely ground oatmeal to make 
a paste of the consistency of butter. 
Apply at night and wear gloves. 

Or use almond paste instead of 
oatmeal in the last. 

Or mix equal parts of white mut- 
ton tallow, unsalted butter, beeswax, 
and stoned raisins. Simmer until the 
raisins are dried up but not burned. 
Strain into molds to cool. This prep- 
aration smarts chapped hands, but 
quickly heals them. 

Camphor Ice. — Oil of sweet al- 



monds, 1 ounce; spermaceti, 2 ounces; 
white wax, 1 ounce; camphor, i 
ounce. Melt these ingredients in a 
double boiler, and pour in molds of 
proper size and form. 

Powder for the Hands. — Common 
starch reduced to powder by grind- 
ing with a knife or in a pestle is a 
good substitute for talcum powder 
for the hands. This is always at 
hand. When taking the hands out of 
suds or dishwater, or after washing 
them when they have been chilled 
by exposure, rinse them thoroughly, 
wipe them, and apply the starch 
while they are still damp, covering 
the whole surface. This is cheap, 
convenient, and easy to try. 

MANICURING 

Finger Nails. — The condition of 
the finger nails is one of the best 
tests of the care given to the toilet. 
Well-groomed finger nails are, as far 
as they go, a mark of refinement. 
Needless to say, the toilet for any so- 
cial occasion is not complete until the 
nails have been thoroughly cleaned, 
trimmed, and, if possible, manicured. 
Young men are usually the worst 
offenders in this respect, and they 
would often have cause to blush if 
they should hear the comments 
caused by their appearances in so- 
ciety with finger nails " decorated in 
mourning." 

Machinists and others whose work 
tends to cause the finger nails to be- 
come grimy will find it helpful to in- 
sert a little lard or cold cream under 
the nails each morning. Housewives 
will find this a good plan when 
blacking stoves. 

The most useful article for use on 
the nails is a small orange stick, 
which can be obtained for a trifle at 
any drug store. With this the nails 
can be cleaned each time the hands 
are washed and the skin which ad- 
heres to the nails carefully pushed 
back. This may also be done with 
a dry towel. It will prevent the skin 
from cracking about the roots of the 
nails and forming hangnails. This 
method practiced daily will greatly 
improve the general appearance of 
the hands.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



The nails should never be bitten. 
By this practice the appearance of 
the hands may be spoiled for life. 
To prevent children from biting their 
nails, rub a little bitter aloes or qui- 
nine on the tips of the fingers. If 
this does not effect a cure, tie glove 
tips upon them until tlie habit is 
given up. 

Ingrowing Nails. — The finger nails 
do not often grow in, but when this 
happens a notch cut in the middle of 
the nail will have a tendency to draw 
it up from the sides. 

Manicuring the Nails. — Special 
care and training must be bestowed 
upon the nails, as their condition in 
regard to shape, color, and texture 
of skin makes or mars the loveliest 
hand. 

It is within the power of any 
woman possessed of average ability 
to become her own manicure. It 
takes only a few minutes each day to 
put the nails in perfect condition, and 
properly kejit nails are indications of 
refinement. A manicure outfit will 
cost two or three dollars. Buy good 
instruments to begin with. You will 
need a flexible file, emery boards, 
buffer, orange sticks, cuticle knife, 
curved needle-pointed scissors, nail 
scissors, some red paste and white 
nail powder, and a good bleach of 
glycerin, rose water, and oxalic acid. 

Begin by shaping the nail with the 
file. When you have finished one 
hand, the fingers should be dipped 
into a bowl of lukewarm water, into 
which has been poured a tablespoon- 
ful of lemon juice and a few drops 
of some pleasant antiseptic as lister- 
ine or peroxide of hydrogen. Let 
them remain in this some time to 
soften the cuticle, and then dry them 
with a soft towel. 

With the point of the orange stick 
clean the nail, dipping the stick in 
the bleach if this is necessary. 
Loosen the skin around the nail with 
the cuticle knife. This skin should 
be lifted up, and not pushed down 
and back, as the latter movement 
cracks and splits the cuticle. Keep 
dipping the knife in the water, as it 
helps to lift up the cuticle, which 
must be well raised before it is cut. 
Now use the cuticle scissors, and try 



to trim the cuticle in one piece, oth- 
erwise you are likely to have ragged 
edges and hangnails. 

Be extremely careful about this 
special part of the treatment, for the 
nail may be altogether spoiled by a 
too zealous use of the cuticle knife 
and scissors. Use your red paste 
sparingly, and rub it well into the 
nails with the palm of your hand. It 
is better to dip the fingers in the wa- 
ter again and dry thoroughly, as you 
cannot polish a wet nail. Cut off a 
hangnail with the nail scissors, and 
smooth the edge of the nail with the 
emery boards. Dip the buffer or pol- 
isher in the nail powder. Place the 
center of the buffer on the nail, and 
rub slightly. 

In a short time you will find it very 
easy to manicure your own nails. 

To Whiten the Nails. — First 
cleanse and soften the nails by soak- 
ing in soft water in which a little 
pure toilet soap has been dissolved, 
and then dip the fingers into a mix- 
ture composed of 2 drams of diluted 
sulphuric acid, 1 dram of tincture of 
myrrh, and 4 ounces of soft water. 
Rinse with clear water and polish. 

Or, to remove stains and discolor- 
ations, moisten a chamois buffer or 
a piece of chamois in a mixture of 
lemon juice and water, or vinegar, 
and water. Dip it into powdered 
pumice stone or putty powder, and 
apply carefully until the stain is re- 
moved. But rub as little as possible, 
and do not use these substances 
oftener than is necessary, as their 
constant use tends to make the nails 
thick and coarse. 

To Toughen the Nails. — Mix 8 
grains of pure rectified tar with i 
ounce of cold cream, rectified lard, 
or suet. Apply liberally to the nails 
at night and draw on a pair of loose 
gloves. 

To Polish the Nails. — Apply, with 
a chamois buffer, a mixture of 1 
ounce each of finely powdered emery 
and cinnabar, softened with olive oil, 
almond oil, or the essential oil of bit- 
ter almonds. 

Diseases of the Nails. — Splinters 
under the nails which cannot easily 
be drawn out by pincers may be re- 
moved by softening the nail with pot-

TOILET PREPARATIONS 

Recipes for the Toilet. — The enor- 
mous array of mixtures of all sorts 
for the toilet evinces equally the pop- 
ular interest in these recipes, and 
the whims, caprices, and vagaries of 
their makers. At first glance the 
number and variety of recipes rec- 
ommended by standard authorities is 
bewildering. A careful study of 
these preparations, however, and their 
tabulation in the form of charts for 
comparison, discloses the fact that 
the number of remedial agents con- 
tained in them is relatively small. 
The various forms in which these 
recipes api)ear are merely so many 
attempts to attract the notice of the 
public, whether by appealing to its 
taste or its convenience. The same 
ingredients, for example, may be 
compounded so as to form washes, 
lotions, emulsions, creams, or pastes, 
according to the degree of dilution 
preferred by the individual user. 
Standard recipes differ also by vary- 
ing the proportions of the same in- 
gredients recommended. Very often 
these ingredients will be the same 
with the exception of the perfumes. 
Needless to say the latter may be 
varied to suit the preference of the 
user. 

There are, of course, certain stand- 
ard tj^jcs of toilet preparations. 
These vary according to the different 
bases, remedial agents, and the kind 
and amount of licjuids employed for 



678 



diluting them. A few words on each 
of these subjects will assist the read- 
er in making a satisfactory selection. 

To Save Money. — Practical sugges- 
tions and instructions for preparing 
all kinds of toilet preparations are 
of universal interest and value. Many 
toilet preparations made according to 
recipes given in this section are 
widely advertised for sale. The cost 
of advertising these articles and plac- 
ing them upon the market is usually 
from 50 to 80 per cent of their retail 
price. The purchaser has to pay all 
this in addition to the original cost 
of tlie ingredients and the labor of 
compounding. Moreover, it is impos- 
sible to tell what the ingredients are 
or whether they are of good quality. 
Very often they are injurious and 
even poisonous. Adulteration and 
substitution are very common. Any- 
one can save from 75 to 95 per cent 
on the cost of these by compounding 
them himself. He will also have the 
satisfaction of knowing exactly what 
the preparations are composed of 
and that the ingredients are fresh 
and of good quality. 

To Make Money. — Some persons, 
however, have little skill in com- 
pounding, or have not the time or 
the projjer facilities for the work. 
While any one can prepare these arti- 
cles, it is, of course, true that a per- 
son may become more expert by giv- 
ing special time and attention to 
them, and especially by the jiractice 
of making up prescriptions in fairly 



TOILET PREPARATIONS 



679 



large quantities. Hence any one who 
has an aptitude for work of this kind 
can malie a good deal of money by 
preparing these articles in quantity, 
putting them up neatly in jars, bot- 
tles, boxes, etc., and afSxing to them 
neat printed labels. These can be 
sold on shares at the local stores, or 
bought by friends and neighbors, or 
peddled from house to house by em- 
ploying young people on a commis- 
sion basis. Mail-order business can 
also be worked up for the sale of 
these preparations. The recipes are 
taken from the formulas of manufac- 
turers of standard toilet articles. 
Such preparations also make a very 
popular bazaar at a church fair. The 
work of compounding them in such 
cases can be delegated to a commit- 
tee. 

Bases. — The standard basis for 
solid and semifluid preparations, as 
pastes, creams, and emulsions, are 
white wax, spermaceti, suet, lard, 
yolk or white of egg, and various 
soaps. 

Animal fats, as lards, suet, and 
the like, must be specially refined and 
prepared for toilet purposes. Tliis 
may be done at home by melting and 
simmering the fat slowly with gen- 
tle heat, and straining it through 
linen one or more times. On the 
farm these animal fats are easily ob- 
tained and consequently inexpensive, 
but unless alcohol or other preserva- 
tives are mixed with them they tend 
to become rancid. Hence small quan- 
tities at a time should be prepared, 
and care should be taken not to em- 
ploy such preparations when they be- 
come in the least degree sour. The 
same caution applies to compounds 
containing the white or yolk of eggs 
and honey. 

White wax, spermaceti, Castile and 
other soaps as bases are free from 
these objections, and recipes contain- 
ing them are to be preferred when 
such ingredients can conveniently be 
obtained. In compounding recipes 
having these solid unguents as bases 
they are first melted slowly with gen- 
tle heat, and while in a melted con- 
dition the other ingredients are 
added. They may also be " cut " or 
dissolved in alcohol and spirits. 



Liquid Bases. — Certain toilet prepa- 
rations, as emulsions, lotions, washes, 
and the like, omit the above solids 
or employ them only in small quanti- 
ties, and in their place use certain 
oils and other liquids as bases. The 
principal liquid bases are almond oil, 
olive oil, glycerin, honey, and the 
like. These have a double value: they 
tend to soothe and also to feed the 
skin. They are, therefore, among the 
most deservedly popular of all in- 
gredients. 

Other Bases. — Gum arable, quince 
seed, and white paste are also em- 
ployed as bases when a certain de- 
gree of adhesiveness is desired, as in 
the preparation of bandoline and 
pomades for the hair and beard. 
The quince seeds are prepared by 
simmering them gently in rose water 
until they form a stiff jelly. This 
must then be strained through a fine 
sieve to remove the hulls. Gum ara- 
ble may be dissolved in warm water. 

Bases of Powders. — Wheat starch 
is the standard base for homemade 
toilet powders, but other materials 
often employed are fuller's earth, 
French chalk, and pearl white. Alm- 
ond meal, like almond oil, has the 
double property of serving as a base 
and also as a remedial agent. 

Remedial Agents. — This term is 
employed to describe certain ingre- 
dients used in toilet preparations 
which have specific curative proper- 
ties. Some of the bases already men- 
tioned, notably almonds, fall also un- 
der this heading. Among others of 
especial value may be noted sub- 
stances which soothe and feed the 
skin, as the yolk of egg, honey, and 
cocoa butter; substances which are 
mildly astringent, as lemon juice, 
alum, spirits, and benzoin; and other 
specifics, as glycerin, camphor, and 
sulphur, whose action varies with dif- 
ferent persons. These agents are in 
most cases of a harmless character 
except when otherwise stated. 

Mineral Agents. — The use of min- 
eral drugs in toilet preparations can- 
not be too earnestly deprecated. In 
many cases they are immediately 
harmful, and defeat the very object 
for which they are intended, as in the 
case of bismuth, which frequently 



680 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



blackens the skin. All compounds 
and preparations containing lead in 
any form are positively dangerous 
and sometimes give rise to blood poi- 
son. These mineral compounds are 
often recommended as heroic reme- 
dies, to be tried when other measures 
have failed; as, for example, for the 
removal of obstinate freckles, moles, 
pimples, and similar disfigurements. 
They are very common in hair dyes 
and i)omades, and are too often em- 
ployed under delusion, caused by the 
misleading statements of friends, 
beauty doctors, or others, and by pub- 
lishers of otherwise reputable books. 

Two statements we desire to ear- 
nestly make and stand by: first, 
mineral drugs in toilet preparations 
are dangerous; and, secondly, they 
are not necessary. The simple and 
harmless remedies hereinafter given, 
if patiently and skillfully applied ac- 
cording to directions, will, in due 
course of time, accomplish the results 
intended, and develop the most per- 
fect complexion that the individual 
is capable of. 

The use of mineral drugs, on the 
other hand, whatever the immediate 
benefits derived from them may ap- 
pear to be, will in the end defeat its 
own object by producing after ef- 
fects ruinous to the complexion, and 
the last state of the deluded indi- 
vidual who employs them will indeed 
be worse than the first. 

Diluents or Vehicles. — Distilled 
water, various perfumed toilet wa- 
ters, as rose water, together with al- 
cohol, rectified spirits of wine, and 
other spirits, are the liquids most 
often recommended for diluting toi- 
let preparations to the consistency 
of creams, lotions, washes, and the 
like. 

Distilled water may be prepared at 
home by attaching a tube to the 
spout of the teakettle, immersing as 
much of its length as possible in a 
basin of water shielded from the fire 
and kept cold, if convenient, with ice, 
and collecting the condensed steam at 
the opposite end of the tube in a 
fruit jar or other receptacle. The ob- 
ject of this process is to remove all 
impurities held in suspension, as lime 
and other minerals which are found 



in hard water; also vegetable and ani- 
mal matter and other impurities. In 
winter clean snow, melted, is equiva- 
lent to distilled water. Rain water 
collected in a clean vessel is a good 
substitute. The ordinary water sup- 
ply, softened if necessary by means 
elsewhere recommended, will usually 
answer every purpose. Elder-flower 
water, orange-flower water, and other 
perfumed toilet waters are often 
recommended, but rose water or plain 
distilled or soft water may be used 
as a substitute, if preferred, in all 
cases. 

Perfumes. — Substances used as per- 
fumes commonly occur in several 
forms, i. e., the attar or essential oil, 
the essence, and the tincture or the 
"water," depending upon the degree 
of dilution. They can also be obtain- 
ed in powdered form, as in sachets. 
The most convenient form in which to 
purchase perfumes is the otto or at- 
tar, i. e., the essential oil. This may 
be purchased in small quantity and 
employed according to taste, a few 
drops being sufficient to perfume most 
toilet preparations in quantities suit- 
able for domestic use. The scent of 
these perfumes is fanailiar to most 
persons, but they can easily be in- 
spected at a drug store and a selec- 
tion can be made. It is not neces- 
sary, of course, to purchase or have 
on hand each and aU the different per- 
fumes recommended. In fact, per- 
fumes are now used very much less 
tlian they were formerly, and a strong 
scent of cologne, musk, or other odor 
about an individual is regarded as a 
mark of vulgarity. Many ladies who 
enjoy perfumes compromise by se- 
lecting any particular odor they pre- 
fer, as violet, rose, lavender, or helio- 
trope, and employ this exclusively in 
the toilet. Any of the essential oils 
may be substituted freely for the oth- 
ers, and the quantity may be varied to 
suit the taste as determined by ex- 
periment. 

Coloring Matters. — The standard 
coloring matters employed for lip 
salve, rouge, cold cream, and the like 
are as follows: for rose pink or red, 
alkanet root or dragon's blood; for 
yellow or orange, palm oil or annotto; 
for blue, finely powdered indigo; for 



TOILET PREPARATIONS 



681 



green, spinach leaves. Other coloring 
matter, as the various lakes and other 
mineral substances, are intentionally 
omitted. 

Utensils Required. — The utensils 
required in compounding the follow- 
ing recipes are usually at hand in 
every household. A small pair of 
druggist's scales or balances is a 
great convenience, and will be found 
useful in many ways. A graduate 
glass, marked for the measurement 
of fluid ounces, is also useful, and 
can be obtained of any druggist or 
dealer in photographic materials. 

In addition to the above a small 
spatula or thin, broad-bladed, flexi- 
ble knife, a small mortar and pestle, 
and one or two short pieces of glass 
tube or rod for stirring, will be 
found convenient. Ordinary porce- 
lain-lined saucepans are the best re- 
ceptacles in which to melt and mix 
the necessary ingredients. A double 
boiler is convenient, but if this can- 
not be had, a large saucepan may be 
partly filled with water, and a small- 
er one containing the ingredients to 
be melted placed within it so that 
the water will reach part way up the 
sides. A few nails or other solid ob- 
jects placed in the bottom of the 
large saucepan will raise the small 
one so as to permit the water to cir- 
culate freely beneath it. In this way 
the ingredients may be melted with- 
out danger of burning or sticking to 
the pan. Care must be taken that 
the water in the outer saucepan does 
not all evaporate or boil up and flood 
the inner one. 

Directions for Compounding.— 
First place the solid or liquid con- 
stituents used as a base in a double 
boiler or saucepan, as above sug- 
gested. Simmer with a gentle heat, 
but without boiUng. When the solids 
are melted and the mass is warm 
enough to flow freely, first put in the 
coloring matter, if any, and simmer 
until the color has been fully incor- 
porated. Next strain through linen 
while still hot. 

Return the mixture to the double 
boiler, and while hot add such spe- 
cific remedial agents as the oil of 
bitter almonds, honey, glycerin, ben- 
zoin, lemon juice, alum, etc. 



If rose water or distilled water is 
to be added to form an emulsion, lo- 
tion, or wash, take the mixture off 
the fire and add the water gradually, 
stirring briskly with a spoon or egg 
beater to insure forming a perfect 
emulsion. The last ingredient to be 
added is always the perfume, and 
this should be done after the mixture 
has cooled somewhat, but before it 
sets. Perfumes are volatile, and if 
added to a heated mixture are likely 
to be wasted by evaporation. 

Compounding of Pastes and Pow- 
ders. — The above instructions apply 
especially to liquid compounds. The 
solid constituents of pastes may be 
rubbed together in a mortar, and 
kneaded with the hands or with a 
spatula on a marble or metal slab, a 
clean piece of zinc, or a kneading 
board. In some cases an egg beater 
can be employed if the consistency of 
the mixture will allow it. Almonds 
for pastes may be reduced in a mor- 
tar to the proper consistency by 
moistening them with rose water and 
grinding them with a pestle, or by 
heating them with water in a sauce- 
pan until the mass assumes a granu- 
lar consistency, somewhat similar to 
cooked oatmeal. Both methods are 
employed, but the former is the more 
common. The materials for toilet 
powders may be compounded by sim- 
ple mixture in a mortar or other suit- 
able receptacle. 

General Suggestions. — We would 
suggest to the novice that it will be 
well to first prepare a small quantity 
of some good toilet powder (prefera- 
bly based on wheat starch), a good 
cold cream, and, if desired, one of 
the liquid emulsions or lotions as a 
wash for the face and hands. 

Other preparations, as pastes, 
rouge, aromatic vinegar, and the like, 
may be made up as occasion demands. 
Persons experienced in these matters 
will, of course, need no suggestions. 

Tables. — A number of tables havi? 
been prepared which contain practi- 
cally aU the standard recipes for the 
toilet in use by beauty doctors and 
others in all parts of the world. An 
exception to this statement has al- 
ready been noted; all recipes contain- 
ing preprrations of lead and other in- 



6SS 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



jurious mineral drugs have been ab- 
solutely excluded. A list of the dif- 
ferent ingredients is given at the left 
of the table, and the name of each 
preparation is quoted at the top. Un- 
der each name and op])osite the 
names of the different ingredients will 
be found the amount of each to be 
employed. General directions for 
compounding the following recipes 
have already been given. Special di- 
rections follow each table when neces- 
sary. 

SIMPLE HOME PREPARATIONS 

The following simple homemade 
preparations are suggested in addi- 
tion to the more elaborate recipes 
given later: 

To Remove Freckles. — Prepara- 
tions recommended for the removal of 
freckles are usually of an acid char- 
acter containing alum, lemon juice, 
horse-radish, buttermilk, and the like; 
also mineral drugs, as salts of lead, 
mercury, bismuth, and others. It 
cannot be too clearly stated that all 
such preparations are distinctly in- 
jurious to the complexion, and their 
frequent use is not to be recommend- 
ed. Most young persons of light 
complexion are annoyed by freckles, 
but these ordinarily pass away in 
later life, and the wisest possible 
course is to pay little attention 
to them and allow nature to ef- 
fect a cure. The application of 
preparations advertised to remove 
freckles, the ingredients of which are 
unknown, should be avoided lest they 
contain bismuth, which is liable to 
blacken the skin, or lead or mercury, 
which are active mineral poisons. 
The following recipes, the active 
principles of which are confined to 
animal or vegetable acids, are less in- 
jurious; but it must be borne in mind 
that all cosmetics of an astringent na- 
ture do their work by contracting the 
pores, which thus become weakened 
and in time are unable to discharge 
their natural functions. The result 
may be, in later life, wrinkles and sal- 
lowness, and the last state of the com- 
plexion may be distinctly worse than 
the first. 

Grate a fresh horse-radish root very 



fine, cover with fresh buttermilk, and 
let stand over night. Strain through 
cheese cloth, and wash the face night 
and morning with the resulting 
liquor. 

Or squeeze the juice of a lemon into 
half a tumbler of water, and use two 
or three times daily as a face wash. 

Or dissolve in lemon juice as much 
sugar as it will hold, and apply with 
a soft brush frequently until the 
freckles disappear. 

Or apply a lotion containing glyc- 
erin, but this is hardly a specific. 

Or put in a double boiler 1 ounce 
of grated Venice soap and 1 ounce 
of pure soft water (or distilled wa- 
ter); melt with gentle heat and con- 
tinue the heating until the water is 
evaporated and only the melted soap 
remains. Remove from the fire, and 
stir in l ounce of lemon juice, i 
ounce of oil of bitter almonds, i 
ounce of deliquidated oil of tartar, 
and 3 drops of oil rhodium. This is 
said to be a recipe of the celebrated 
Mme. de Maintenon, the mistress of 
Louis XIV of France. 

Or this mixture can be prepared 
by grating the soap, pouring over it 
the lemon juice and other ingredients, 
exposing it to direct sunlight, and 
shaking occasionally until it is of the 
right consistency. Apply to the face 
at night. 

Or mix J pint of tincture of tola, 
i pint of tincture of benzoin, and i 
ounce of oil of rosemary. Put a tea- 
spoonful of this mixture in one 
fourth tumblerful of pure soft water, 
and apply to the face with a soft 
sponge two or three times a day. 

But none of these preparations can 
be regarded as desirable lotions for 
regular or frequent use. 

Cucumber Milk. — Slice three or 
four large cucumbers with the skin 
on, add 4 pint of water, boil, stir to 
a soft pulp, cool, and strain. Mix 
H ounces of this cucumber juice, 1* 
ounces of 95 per cent alcohol, and J 
ounce of grated Castile soap. Let 
stand in a warm place over night; 
next day add 8 ounces more of the 
cucumber juice, 1 ounce of oil of 
sweet almonds, 20 drops of tincture 
of benzoin, and 5 grains of boracic 
acid. Shake well before using, and

apply to the face two or three times 
a day with a soft cloth or sponge. 

Milk for the Skin. — New milk, 
skimmed milk, and buttermilk each 
possess properties peculiar to it- 
self, and they all make useful and 
simple washes having a general emol- 
lient action on the skin. If used daily 
they tend to make the skin soft, 
smooth, and white, and to preserve it 
from the effects of exposure to 
weather. Buttermilk is useful for 
freckles and acne, and relieves itch- 
ing and local irritations of the skin. 
Pure, fresh cream is a simple and ef- 
fective preventive of chapped hands 
and lips, and is excellent to cure these 
evils. 

Milk as a cosmetic may be im- 
proved by infusing in it freshly 
grated horse-radish, or infusing in 
new milk or buttermilk a quantity of 
flowers of sulphur. These are useful 
remedies for freckles and other dis- 
colorations and slight eruptions of 
the skin. 

Or mix flowers of sulphur with a 
little new milk and let stand an hour 
or two to settle. Pour off the milk 
from the sediment, and rub well into 
the skin before washing. This mix- 
ture is for immediate use only, and 
must be prepared daily. It may be 
prepared at night with evening milk 
and used the next morning, but not 
afterwards. Two or three table- 
spoonfuls are all that need be pre- 
pared at a time. 

Or boil 1 cupful of fine Scotch oat- 
meal — not breakfast food — in 1 pint 
of boiling water until it forms a clear 
liquid. Use a double boiler, or place 
the saucepan containing the oat- 
meal in an open kettle or pan of boil- 
ing water to prevent sticking or burn- 
ing. Strain the clear liquid through a 
cloth, boil again, and strain a second 
time. Add rose water, elder-flower 
water, or orange-flower water until 
the liquor has the consistency of milk. 
Add a few drops of your favorite per- 
fume, and bottle for use. 

Lemon Juice. — Dilute fresh lemon 
juice with five or six times its volume 
of pure soft water. This, however, 
should not be used too frequentlj'^ on 
account of its acid quality and tend- 
ency to impair the work of the pores 



of the skin. It may, however, be used 
on occasion to relieve itching or local 
irritation. 

Or mix equal parts of lemon juice, 
toilet water, and alcohol. Let stand 
over night, pour off the clear liquid, 
and strain through silk or linen. 

Kalydor. — Dissolve 2 drams of 
tincture of benzoin in 1 pint of rose 
water, and use as a face wash for the 
complexion. 

Magnesia Cream. — Mix fine pow- 
dered magnesia with rose water to a 
thin cream, dip the face in warm wa- 
ter to open the pores, apply a glyc- 
erin lotion, and afterwards apply the 
magnesia cream. Let dry and re- 
move with a soft towel. 

Or dissolve fuller's earth in water, 
stir well, then let it settle, and use 
once or twice daily. 

Honey. — Honey is a favorite in- 
gredient in various lotions under the 
name of "honey water," "balsam of 
honey," and the like. The term 
"honey water" is also applied to 
certain combinations of perfumes 
that do not, in fact, contain honey. 

To prepare honey water from 
honey, put in a 2-quart fruit jar 4 
ounces of pure white honey with ^ 
ounce of fresh grated lemon peel, i 
ounce each of calamayta, benzoin, and 
storax, i ounce of cloves, and * ounce 
of nutmeg. Add 2 ounces each of 
rose water and elder-flower water and 
12 fluid ounces of 95 per cent alcohol. 
Let stand 3 or 4 days, shaking fre- 
quently, run through a filter, and bot- 
tle for use. 

Or, for balsam of honey, mix with 
gentle heat 8 ounces of pure white 
honey and 2 ounces of best quality 
glycerin. Let stand until cool, stir in 
2 fluid ounces of 95 per cent alcohol, 
and add 10 drops of the essence of 
ambergris. 

Glycerin. — When pure, glycerin is 
a colorless viscid liquid, having a 
sweet taste and without odor. All 
the ordinary fats contain glycerin, 
which is produced by treating animal 
fats \v\th alkalies, such as caustic 
soda or potash, as is done in the man- 
ufacture of soap. Glycerin is a by- 
product of soap factories. It may 
also be produced by treating fats 
with superheated steam, as is done 



684. 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



in the manufacture of candles. 
Hence glycerin is also a by-product 
of candle factories. 

Glycerin mixes freely with water, 
and pure glycerin absorbs about one 
half its own weight from the atmos- 
phere. It is an excellent solvent, and 
is an important ingredient of po- 
mades, toilet soaps, and cosmetics. 
Glycerin is recommended as a lotion 
for irritation of the skin and for 
itching; also as a preventive against 
sunburn, chaps, and redness from ex- 
posure to the weather. A prepara- 
tion of 1 ounce of glycerin to 19 
ounces of pure soft water is about 
right for regular use as a face wash, 
and is an excellent vehicle in which 
to dissolve various remedies. 

Or 1 ounce of glycerin to 9 ounces 
of water may be used for chapped 
hands and lips, or whenever a strong 
solution is desired. 

Borax. — Dissolve 5 drams of borax 
in 1 ]iint of pure soft or distilled wa- 
ter, and use as a wash for sore gums 
or nipples, boils, or any other irrita- 
tion of the skin or mucous membrane. 

Or combine borax with glycerin in 
the proportion of 6 drams of borax 
and IJ ounces of pure glycerin; add 
16 ounces of rose water. This may 
be used regularly as a face wash. 

Or mix | ounce of powdered borax 
with 1 ounce of pure glycerin and 16 



Or to 1 ounce of glycerin add 2 
ounces of fresh lemon juice, 1 pint 
of pure distilled water, and 1 pint of 
rose water. Apply to the face sev- 
eral times a day and let dry before 
rinsing. 

Lotions for Tan or Sunburn. — 
These are based princijjally on oil of 
almonds, with the addition of Castile 
soap and rock candy, and contain 
various remedial agents, including as- 
tringents, as alum and lemon juice, 
also benzoin, tincture of tolu, tartar 
oil, ox gall, and the like. They are 
diluted usually with alcohol or any 
perfumed toilet water, for which 
plain distilled or soft water may be 
substituted. And they may be per- 
fumed with any essential oil or es- 
sence preferred. Apply any of these 
lotions to the face with a small 
sponge or a soft linen rag. Let it 
dry on without rubbing, and after- 
wards wash the face with soft warm 
water. 

The following is a simple remedy 
for tan or sunburn: apply peroxide 
of hydrogen, pouring a teaspoonful or 
more in the palm of the hand, and ap- 
plying it equally over the hands, arms, 
and face. Let it dry wthout rub- 
bing. After it is thoroughly dry, ap- 
ply any good lotion. This will rapid- 
ly bleach the skin without injuring the 
most delicate complexion.

Almond Preparations. — The prime 
favorite among all ingredients of the 



TOILET PREPARATIONS

various toilet preparations is proba- 
bly the nut or kernel of the almond, 
of which there are two sorts: the 
sweet and the bitter. The almond is 
the fruit of a tree very similar to the 
peach tree. It is cultivated exten- 
sively in Southern Europe, and is now 
grown largely in California. Al- 
monds are much cheaper now than 
they were foi'merly, and are likely to 
become cheaper still. The almond 
contains two active principles: an 
odorless fixed oil of a light color, 
which is obtained by pressure; and 
tlic oil of bitter almonds, which is a 
volatile oil obtained by crushing bit- 
ter almonds in cold water and by dis- 
tillation. This latter oil is colorless, 
limpid, and has the distinctive odor 
of bitter almonds, similar to that of 
prussic acid. It sometimes contains 
prussic acid, in which case, if taken 
internally even in minute quantities, 
it is a deadly poison. 

The ordinary almonds of commerce 
arc sweet almonds of the thin- 
shelled varieties. They contain about 
50 per cent or more of almond oil, 
which may be extracted by boiling in 
water or by softening the kernels with 
water or other liquid, rubbing them 
in a mortar, and mixing the resulting 
mass with various other ingredients. 
Or the oils of commerce may be util- 
ized. Preparations of almonds for 
toilet purposes are variously known 
as " milk of almonds," " almond 
cream," " almond paste," and the like. 
They are likewise known as English, 
French, or other "milk of roses," and 
by similar fanciful titles, arising from 
the various added ingredients and the 
wishes of the different manufacturers. 

Among the ingredients most often 
added to almonds in these prepara- 
tions are solid unguents, as white 
wax, spermaceti, white paste, and the 
like; also liquid unguents, as glycerin, 
honey, the yolk of cf^g, and similar 
substances. Perfumed and distilled 
water, alcohol, and other spirits are 
often used as vehicles. And various 
specifics for the complexion, as ben- 
zoin, salts of tartar, alum, lemon juice, 
and other cosmetics, may be added. 
All recipes containing mineral sub- 
stances, as salts of lead, mercury, bis- 
muth, and the like, are here omitted. 



The oil of almonds is a gentle 
emollient. It not only softens but 
also feeds the skin. Hence it is a 
specific for the complexion, and is 
especially useful for chaps, sunburn, 
redness, and other local irritations. 
The following are standard recipes 
for milk, cream, or paste of almonds, 
in the order mentioned. Among these 
are proprietary articles which are 
sold under various fanciful titles at 
exorbitant prices, but which can be 
readily prepared at home by any one 
who cares to take the necessary pains, 
with the advantage of knowing that 
the materials are fresh and pure and 
that the mixture contains nothing in- 
jurious. 

Milk of Almonds. — The principal 
object to be attained in preparing 
milk of almonds or milk of roses is 
to form a perfect emulsion which will 
not separate, or which, if it separates 
after standing, may be emulsified by 
shaking. Such substances as soap, 
gum, wax, and the like, are added 
for this purpose, and all such prepa- 
rations will be improved by beating 
thoroughly with an egg beater or oth- 
erwise after all the ingredients have 
been incorporated. 

The milk of roses varies from the 
milk of almonds merely in being per- 
fumed with rose water or the essence 
or attar of roses. Other perfumes 
are frequently added, but in such 
limited quantities that the scent of 
roses predominates. 

Rub up in a mortar 1 ounce of 
sweet blanched almonds by adding, 
a little at a time, J pint of distilled 
water or pure soft water, mixing and 
rubbing constantly until a smooth, 
homogeneous milky emulsion is 
formed. Finally strain the resulting 
mixture through a jiiece of net or 
gauze to remove the coarser particles. 
This is the common "millt of al- 
monds " of perfumers, to which glyc- 
erin, %'arious cosmetics, perfumes, and 
coloring matter may be added as de- 
sired. 

Or mix in a mortar 5 drams of 
blanched almonds, 2 drams of white 
lump sugar or rock candy, and 1 
dram of powdered gum arabic, and 
rub up the whole together in the same 
manner, adding distilled water, a lit- 



686 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



tie at a time, until 8 fluid ounces have 
been incorporated. This is an Irish 
formula, and is especially useful when 
it is desired to add oils, gums, or 
balsams. 

Or milk of bitter almonds or emul- 
sion of bitter almonds may be pre- 
pared in the same manner by substi- 
tuting blanched bitter almonds for 
the sweet variety. The milk of bitter 



lavender, and 8 drops of attar of 
roses. Add this mixture to the " milk 
of almonds," rub up thoroughly in a 
mortar, beat with an egg beater or 
otherwise to form a perfect emulsion, 
and strain through silk or linen. 

Enough has been said to indicate 
the method of compounding these 
recipes. The following may be pre- 
pared in the same manner:

Complexion Paste. — The principal 
ingredients in standard pastes for the 
complexion consist of solid and liquid 
unguents, as spermaceti, wax, paste, 
suet, various soaps, and the like; 
soothing substances, as almond oil and 
honey; mild astringents, as lemon 
juice and alum; rose water and alco- 
hol for mixing purposes, and vari- 
ous perfumes. 

As in other toilet preparations, the 
solid unguents give substance to the 
compound and hold the various reme- 
dial agents in suspension. Yolk of 
ef:g, almonds, honey, and the like, feed 
the skin, and other ingredients are

used for convenience in compounding, 
perfuming, etc. 

Any of these pastes may be colored 
by adding coloring matter in the 
process of preparation while the mix- 
ture is in a liquid state. Rich rose, 
pink, or red may be obtained by dis- 
solving i dram of alkanet root or 
dragon's blood in about 8 ounces of 
melted fat. For orange or yellow, 
use palm oil or annotto. For blue, 
use finely powdered indigo. For 
green, steep spinach leaves in oil, and 
strain before using. 

If coloring matter is not used, 
these pastes will be of a pure white 
or a slightly tinted yellow from the 
yolk of egg. 

In compounding the above mixtures, 
a small marble mortar and pestle will 
be found convenient. 

White of egg may be boiled in rose 
water or plain soft or distilled wa- 
ter. Where pulverized almonds are 
required, it is better to obtain the 
fresh nuts and pulverize them shortly 
before using. The nuts may be first 
crushed by a rolling-pin, and after- 



wards pulverized in a mortar. A few 
drops of rose water or almond oil 
added in the mortar will assist by 
softening them. An egg beater will 
be found convenient in thoroughly 
blending all the ingredients in these 
mixtures. Perfumes must be added 
while the material is in a liquid state. 
When oil is used, perfume may be 
first mingled with the oil. Sperma- 
ceti, white and other soaps, may be 
first reduced to liquid form by melt- 
ing. Where alkanet root or other 
may be improved by straining while 
solid substances are used, the paste 
in a liquid condition through a linen 
cloth. The milk of pistachio nuts 
may be obtained by distilling fresh 
peeled nuts in an equal quantity of 
rose water. Simmer over a slow fire, 
and when melted form an emulsion 
with the egg beater. 

With a little attention to the above 
instructions any one may compound a 
paste for himself, and have the sat- 
isfaction of knowing that the ma- 
terials are fresh and that no harmful 
ingredients have been used.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Almond Paste may be prepared in 
two ways: either in the cold or by 
cooking the almonds. To prepare al- 
mond paste in the cold, pound the 
dry kernels of sweet almonds to a fine 
powder in an earthenware or marble 
mortar. This will require time and 
patience. When the almonds are suf- 
ficiently fine, add just enough elder- 
flower, rose, or orange-flower water 
to make a paste of the desired consist- 
ency and perfume with some essential 
oil — as the attar of roses, bergamot, 
neroli, or any other desired. Pre- 
serve in covered glass jars. 

Or, to prepare paste of bitter al- 
monds, take equal parts of bitter and 
sweet almonds and proceed as before. 
It is not necessary to add perfumes, 
as the scent of the bitter almonds is 
sufficient. 

Or add to either of the above 2 
ounces of powdered spermaceti or 1 
ounce of grated Castile soap for each 
pound of almonds. 

Or the white of 1 egg to each pound 
of almonds. 

Or, to prepare almond paste by 
cooking, chop or grind 2i ounces of 
blanched bitter almonds, which may 
be done by passing them through a 
meat cutter, cover with 8 ounces of 
elder-flower or orange-flower water, 
and cook over a slow fire, stirring 
constantly until the almond kernels 
burst and assume the consistency of 
paste. If the fire is too brisk or the 
mass is not constantly stirred, the al- 
monds will burn and the quality of 
the paste will be impaired. It must 
be borne in mind that much of the 
oil of bitter almonds is volatilized by 
heat, and care must be taken not to 
breathe the fumes, which are poison- 
ous. Before removing from the fire, 
stir in 4 ounces more of orange- 
flower or elder-flower water, and rub 
up the paste in a mortar to the proper 
consistency, adding 16 ounces of al- 
cohol and 3 ounces of attar of roses 
or any other essential oil desired. 
Rub through a hair or other fine sieve 
and bottle for use. 

Or, for honey-almond paste, heat in 
a double boiler i ounces of pure white 
honey, strain through cheese cloth, 
and add 4 ounces of bitter white 
paste, 8 ounces of expressed oil of 



bitter almonds, and 2J yolks of eggs. 
Add the egg and the oil gradually, 
and beat vigorously with an egg 
beater or otherwise, as in preparing 
mayonnaise. 

COLD CREAM 

Cold Creams. — The basis of most 
cold creams is either white wax or 
spermaceti or both, with almond oil 
or rectified animal fats, as lard, suet, 
and the like, to which may be added 
various specifics for the complexion, 
and distilled waters, essences, or es- 
sential oils to perfume as desired. 

Cold cream is among the most use- 
ful of all toilet preparations, both as 
a preventive and as a remedy for sun- 
burn and reddening of the skin by 
exposure, chapped hands and lips, 
frostbite, and other local irritations. 
It is also useful for whitening the 
hands and to prevent wrinkles. For 
this purpose it should be applied at 
night and thoroughly washed off in 
the morning. The hands may be pro- 
tected at night by a loose pair of kid 
or chamois gloves. 

To prepare cold cream, melt in 
a double boiler i? drams of white wax, 

1 ounce of spermaceti, and 3J ounces 
of oil of sweet almonds. Remove 
from the fire and add in a thin stream 

2 fluid ounces of rose water, and stir 
constantly until cold. Those who can 
use glycerin with safety may add i 
ounce to 1 ounce before the mixture 
sets. 

Or, for a medicated cold cream, 
melt with gentle heat in a double 
boiler i ounce of white wax, i ounce 
of spermaceti, and 4 ounces of al- 
mond oil. Mix separately i fluid 
oimce each of the tinctures of bal- 
sam of Peru, tolu, and benzola, to 
which add in a thin stream 2 fluid 
ounces of elder-flower water. Beat 
in the meantime with an egg beater 
or otherwise to form a complete 
emulsion. Pour this emulsion in a 
thin stream into the melted wax and 
oil, meantime beating with an egg 
beater until all the ingredients are 
fully incorporated. When cold, this 
compound will set as a permanent 
cold cream which is highly recom- 
mended as a cosmetic.

Or melt together in a double boiler

AROMATIC VINEGAR 

Aromatic Vinegar, or Toilet Vine- 
gar, is a toilet preparation, the active 
principle of which is acetic acid in 
the form of glacial acetic acid, white 
wine or other vinegar, or the like. It 
may be perfumed according to taste 
and may serve as a vehicle for va- 
rious cosmetics. To compound toilet 
vinegar, first dissolve the essential oils 
or other perfumes in the spirits, next 
add the vinegar or acetic acid, and 
lastly the distilled or toilet water. 

Or, if no spirits are used, mix the 
ingredients in a glass fruit jar or 
other tightly stoppered vessel, and 
let stand for several days, shaking 
frequently. 

The following recipes are recom- 
mended : 

Dissolve in i pint of pale rum 1 
dram each of the essences of berga- 



ic acid 1 ounce of camphor. .\dd 
5 grains of pure oil of lavender and 
12 grains of oil of cinnamon. 

Or put in a close vessel 4 ounces of 
dried red-rose leaves, and pour over 
them 1 quart of white-wine vinegar; 
add i pint of strong essence of rose. 
Seal and let stand 2 or 3 weeks, shak- 
ing frequently; filter and preserve in 
a tightly stoppered glass vessel. 

TOILET POWDERS 

The bases of most toilet powders 
are compounds of magnesia, includ- 
ing talc or talcum — which chemically 
is magnesium silicate, and which is 
mined in large quantities in various 
parts of the world — and French 
chalk, which is not chalk but grotmd 
soapstone; fuller's earth, a greenish 
clay found in many parts of England 
and on the continent of Europe; and 
starch, especially rice and wheat 
starch, which is sometimes adulter- 
ated with cornstarch, potato starch,

etc. These preparations usually con- 
tain pulverized perfumed woods, as 
orris root, sandalwood, and other 
perfumes. In addition, it is quite 
customary to use in face powder me- 
tallic bismuth, preparations of mer- 
cury, and other mineral drugs — all 
of which are distinctly harmful, and 
the use of which is therefore never ad- 
visable. No recipes of this sort are 
included in tlie present volume. 

The following are standard prepa- 
rations which contain no injurious 
ingredients: 

For plain face powder without per- 
fume, pure white starch can hardly 
be improved upon. 

Or mix together equal quantities of 
rice flour, fuller's earth, and white 
starch, and perfume with any essen- 
tial oil — rose, violet, or any other 
preferred. 

Or, for violet powder, mix 3 ounces 
of white starch with 1 ounce of pow- 
dered orris root, rub up together in 
water, and perfiune with the essen- 
tial oils of lemon, bergaraot, and 
cloves, using about double the amount 
of lemon as of the two others. 

Or, for a rose face powder, mix 8 
ounces of pulverized rose leaves with 
4 ounces of pulverized sandalwood, 
and add 1 dram of the attar of roses. 

Or to 3^ pounds of powdered rose 
or white starch, add | dram of rose 
pink and 1 dram each of rose oil and 
santal oil. 

ROUGE 

Rouge Paste and Powder. — The 
base of rouge for the lips and cheeks 
is usually French chalk, almond oil, 
or other animal fat, or oil, or one of 
the gums, as gum tragacanth, colored 
with cochineal, carmine, vermilion, 
alkanet, or other red coloring matter, 
and perfumed to taste. To this may 
be added a mild astringent, as alum, 
acetic acid, and the like. 

For carmine rouge, raise to a boil 
in an aluminum or copper vessel 1 
quart of distilled water, to which add 
1 ounce of the best pulverized cochi- 
neal. After 5 or 6 minutes stir in 
carefully 30 grains of powdered Ro- 
man alum. Continue boiling 3 to 5 
minutes and set aside to cool. When 



lukewarm, but before the mixture set- 
tles, pour off the clear liquor from 
the sediment through a piece of white 
silk or chiffon into a glass fruit jar. 
Let stand 3 or 4 days and again pour 
off through white silk into another 
vessel. Allow the resulting liquor to 
settle; pour off the clear liquor from 
the top, and dry the sediment care- 
fully in a cool, shady place. The re- 
sult is a very finely divided powder, 
making a rouge of the best quality. 

Or finely powdered carmine can be 
used by taking a piece of fine un- 
scented pomatum about the size of 
a pea, and placing on it a bit of car- 
mine the size of a pin head. Mix the 
two together and apply with a bit of 
cotton. 

Or the rouge ordinarily used for 
theatrical purposes may be prepared 
by mixing fine French chalk with any 
quantity of powdered carmine neces- 
sary to give the required color. 

Or the so-called Turkish rouge 
may be prepared by putting 1 ounce 
of alkanet in a glass fruit jar and 
pouring over it 1 ounce of alcohol. 
Let stand for a week or 10 days, 
shaking frequently; strain and bottle 
for use. 

Or vinegar rouge may be prepared 
by mixing together li drams each of 
powdered cochineal and carmine lake 
and 3 drams of alcohol. Pour over 
these i pint of alcohol and let stand 
2 or 3 weeks; afterwards strain and 
bottle for use. Perfume with essen- 
tial oils according to taste. 

Liquid Rouge. — Rouge in liquid 
form is variously known as " bloom 
of youth," " bloom of roses," " al- 
mond bloom," " Turkish bloom," etc. 
These various preparations are based 
upon distilled water and alcohol, or 
other spirit, as vehicles, and are col- 
ored with Brazil wood, red sanders, 
cochineal, and various other red col- 
oring matter. In some instances 
they contain an adhesive ingredient, 
as isinglass, and various specifics, as 
benzoin, alum, borax, and the like. 

Put in a glass fruit jar 2 drams of 
dragon's blood, 2 ounces of red san- 
ders, and 1* ounces of gum benzoin; 
pour over these 2 ounces of 90 per 
cent, alcohol and 4 ounces of pure 
soft water. Seal the jar and let 



TOILET PREPARATIONS 



691 



stand a week or 10 days, shaking fre- 
quently; filter and bottle for use. 

Or put in a glass fruit jar 4 ounces 
of finely powdered cochineal; add 4 
fluid ounces of distilled water and 
the same amount of aqua ammonia; 
cover with a wet cloth and let sim- 
mer 3 or 4 hours in a double boiler. 
This preparation is ready for use as 
soon as it is cool. 

Circassian Cream. — Put in a glass 
fruit jar 4 ounces of fresh suet, 6 
ounces of olive oil, li ounces of pow- 
dered gum benzoin, and A ounce of 
alkanet root. Place the jar in a dou- 
ble boiler and simmer with gentle 
heat for several hours. Let stand 24 
hours more; heat, and strain through 
cheese cloth, and when cold perfume 
with i dram of essence of ambergris, 
i dram of oil of lavender, or any 
other essential oil preferred. 

Chapped Lips. — Preparations rec- 
ommended for chapped lips are usu- 
ally based upon white wax, sperma- 
ceti, or beeswax, with the addition of 
almond oil and such specifics as ben- 
zoin, honey, unsalted butter, and the 
like, adding perfumes and coloring 
matter according to taste. 

Melt together with gentle heat 2 
ounces of white wax and 1 ounce of 
spermaceti; add 2 ounces of pure 
strained honey, and continue to heat 
and stir xmtil fully incorporated. 
Add in a thin stream 4 ounces of oil 
of almonds; remove from the fire and 
continue stirring until the mixture is 
nearly cold; finally perfume with any 
essential oil according to taste. 

Or use pure clarified honey. Per- 
fume as desired. 

Or mix equal quantities of white 
sugar candy, white wax, oil of al- 
monds, and spermaceti, melting all 
together with gentle heat. 

ESSENCES AND PERFUMES 

Perfumes. — The subject of per- 
fumery is perhaps not so important 
as it was formerly, because the use of 
strong perfumes appears to be going 
out of fashion. The natural fra- 
grance of flowers, spices, and per- 
fumed woods — the sources of the in- 
gredients used in perfumery — is, 
however, so delightful that those sub- 



stances are likely always to be em- 
ployed to some extent in the toilet. 

The various forms in which per- 
fumes are placed upon the market 
are, according to the degree of dilu- 
tion, the attar or essential oil — also 
called otto — the essence or extract, 
and the perfumed toilet water. In- 
numerable compoimds are sold under 
various fanciful titles, as colognes, 
scents, spirits (French esprit), and 
the like. The substances from which 
these perfumes are obtained may also 
in some cases be purchased, as the 
dry leaves or flowers of plants, vari- 
ous kinds of wood or roots, ambergris 
(supposed to be a morbid secretion of 
the sperm whale), and the like. 

Perfumes are also used in the form 
of sachets or dry powder, to be 
placed among garments or linen, 
either in sachet bags or scattered 
loosely in chests and drawers. They 
are likewise employed to perfume the 
atmosphere of a room by putting 
them in open jars, or burning them in 
the form of pastilles and incense. 

Generally speaking, the most con- 
venient form in which to obtain per- 
fumes is the attar (otto), or essential 
oil. A few drops of these concen- 
trated substances, usually about 5 or 
6 drops to the pint or pound, will 
yield any desired odor. When the 
essence, the perfumed water, or the 
original substances themselves are 
prescribed in recipes, the essential oil 
can be substituted in most cases by 
a little careful experimenting. The 
process of extracting essences and es- 
sential oils, however, is not difficult, 
and can be carried on at home by 
any one who is interested enough to 
procure suitable apparatus. Several 
methods of preparing homemade ex- 
tracts are given below which can be 
employed successfully by any one. 

Volatile Oils. — These are found 
naturally in plants, and are usually 
obtained by distillation. They are 
distinguished by their pungent odor 
and also by the fact that they are 
not capable of uniting with alkalies 
to form soaps. They are used prin- 
cipally in perfumery, with the excep- 
tion of turpentine, which is employed 
in mixing paints and varnishes. This 
oil is obtained from various cone- 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



bearing trees, and exudes from the 
bark mixed with rosin and other 
vegetable juices, from which it is ex- 
tracted by distillation. 

The volatile oils upon being ex- 
posed to air absorb oxygen and crys- 
tallize into substances having the ap- 
pearance of rosin, balsam, or gum 
camphor. The perfumed oils, if not 
tightly corked, gradually lose their 
delicate scent. Most volatile oils are 
obtained by distillation in the pres- 
ence of water or alcohol, but others 
are obtained by mechanical processes 
without heat. The essential oils in 
solution with water are known as es- 
sences, as essence of pennyroyal or of 
mint, and the like. These are often 
prepared by distillation with water, 
forming the distilled perfumed wa- 
ters of commerce. The bath in which 
perfume-bearing substances are dis- 
tilled should be slightly acidulated 
with suljjhuric acid. Use a few drops 
only — just enough to give a sour 
taste to the tongue. All the essen- 
tial oils are soluble in alcohol and 
ether. 

To Test Essential Oils. — As many 
of the essential oils are expensive, 
they are frequently adulterated. Ob- 
tain a drop of the pure oil and deter- 
mine the presence of substitutes by 
placing a drop of each on separate 
pieces of paper and comparing them 
carefully. The attar of roses is often 
adulterated with the oils of rhodium, 
sandalwood, camphor, spermaceti, etc. 
The pure article has a sweet, smooth 
taste. A bitter taste indicates the oil 
of rhodium or sandalwood; a pungent 
flavor, the oil of geranium or cam- 
phor; a greasy stain on paper, sper- 
maceti. 

Or mix a drop of the attar of roses 
with a drop of sulphuric acid. The 
pure attar will not be affected, but 
the adulterated article will become 
dark colored, and the characteristic 
odors of the different substances with 
which it may have been adulterated 
can easily be discerned. 

Or, to test for adulteration with 
fixed oils, place a drop of the sus- 
pected oil on paper and evaporate it 
with gentle heat. The presence of a 
fixed oil will be detected by a perma- 
nent greasy stain. 



Or distill off the volatile oil with 
gentle heat. The fixed oil will be left 
behind. 

Or add three or four times its vol- 
ume of 80 per cent alcohol. The 
fixed oil will not be dissolved. 

Or, to test for alcohol, dilute the 
suspected oil with water. If the 
quantity of alcohol is large, the mix- 
ture will become roily or turbid. 

To test for oil of turpentine — 
which is often used to adulterate the 
oils of orange, lemon, neroli, and the 
like — set a little of the oil on fire, 
blow it out, and the presence of tur- 
pentine may be detected by its char- 
acteristic odor. 

Odor of Perfumes. — The odor of 
the volatile oils is probably caused 
by their gradual oxidation or chemi- 
cal union with the oxj'gen of the air. 
This is the same process as that 
which takes place in the rusting of 
iron, and is similarly promoted by 
moisture. Wlien treated chemically 
so as to be perfectly pure and free 
from oxygen and moisture, the most 
powerful perfumes are odorless. Ex- 
posure to moist air restores their 
odor. Perfume-bearing flowers are 
much more fragrartt when moistened, 
as with dew. In dry climates roses 
and other fragrant blossoms are 
nearly scentless. Rose jars and other 
mixtures of dry perfume-bearing sub- 
stances give off very much more per- 
fume when slightly moistened. 

Individual Perfumes. — Many per- 
sons prefer to have a perfume of 
their own different from those which 
are on the market or used by others 
among their acquaintances. This is 
not especially difficult, although the 
perfumes that are usually employed, 
such as heliotrope, violet, white rose, 
and the like, may, of course, be ob- 
tained by any one. An individual 
perfume may be secured by experi- 
menting with two or more essential 
oils, mixing and blending a few drops 
at a time until a new and agreeable 
fragrance is obtained. This is, in 
fact, the way in which colognes and 
similar preparations are compounded 
for the market. One celebrated 
"German cologne" of the past gen- 
eration is said to have contained no 
fewer than thirty different kinds of 



TOILET PREPARATIONS 



693 



ingredients, the result being a pun- 
gent perfume of a peculiarly agree- 
able odor. The proportion in which 
the various ingredients should be 
blended is entirely a matter of indi- 
vidual preference, to be determined 
by experiment. 



sachet powders, it is only necessary 
to finely pulverize the solids in a mor- 
tar, add the essential oils drop by 
drop, and mix the whole thoroughly 
together. When not required for 
use, sachet powder should be kept in 
tightly sealed boxes, jars, or bottles,

Sachet Powders. — Various solid 
perfume-bearing substances, to which 
may be added small quantities of the 
essential oils, are used in powdered 
form and sprinkled between layers of 
absorbent cotton or otherwise to per- 
fume garments laid away in chests or 
drawers. To prepare the various 



so that the volatile perfumes will not 
be lost by evaporation. 

Incense — Pastilles. — Several per- 
fume-bearing substances may be util- 
ized in solid form by mixing them 
with combustibles, such as charcoal, 
niter, and various gums, and setting 
them on Are to perfume apartments.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



The table on page 695 embraces a 
number of recipes for incense pas- 
tilles. In all cases first reduce the 
solids separately to powder in a mor- 
tar. This may be done by beating the 
ingredients together in an earthen- 
ware bowl, or by mixing them on a 
marble slab or plate of glass with an 
ordinary knife or a palette knife hav- 
ing a thin, broad blade. If gum 
tragacanth is used, it should be dis- 
solved in water to the consistency of 



paste with the charcoal. Dry this 
paste thoroughly, and pour over it 
the liquid perfumes. If other solid 
ingredients are added, they should be 
in powdered form. Mix the whole 
with gum tragacanth dissolved as 
above. Dry and use as above. 

Rose Perfume. — One of the most 
universally popular odors is the per- 
fume of the rose. Most persons can 
obtain rose petals in any quantity 
during the month of June, and their

mucilage. The essential oils and other 
liquid perfumes are then to be added 
and thoroughly worked into the mass, 
the whole formed into small cones 
like chocolate drops, and thoroughly 
dried either in a very slow oven or 
by the heat of the sun. When re- 
quired for use, one or more of these 
cones may be placed on any hot sur- 
face or set on fire at the tip and al- 
lowed to gradually smolder, when 
they will give off an agreeable per- 
fume. 

Or, where niter and charcoal are 
both employed, dissolve the niter in 
suflScient soft water to make a soft 



fragrance may be extracted and 
stored for future enjoyment. 

Attar of Rose. — This costly per- 
fume is prepared principally in the 
Orient and imported to America, but 
the process of preparation is simplic- 
ity itself and can be tried by any one. 
A large quantity of petals of the rose 
are picked carefully so as to be free 
from all foreign substances. They 
are then placed in a large earthen 
pot or a wooden vessel, covered with 
pure soft or distilled water, and ex- 
posed to sunshine. The vessel should 
be taken indoors at night, kept cov- 
ered, and placed preferably in a warm

spot. The attar or essential oil of 
tJhe rose petals rises on the surface 
in the form of a scum. This may be 
carefully taken up by a small piece 
of absorbent cotton on the end of a 
stick. The oil may then be squeezed 
from the cotton into a very small vial 
with a glass or rubber stopper and 
preserved for use. The process 
should be continued until the scum 



gentle heat until the oil has fully ex- 
tracted both the odor and the color 
of the flowers. Or the essential oil 
of roses or of any flower which has an 
agreeable fragrance may be extracted 
as follows: procure a quantity of the 
petals of any flower or flowers de-

no longer rises. The vessel in which 
the roses are steeped should be cov- 
ered during the day with a fine 
screen; otherwise it is likely to be- 
come a breeding place for mosqui- 
toes. Needless to say, it should be 
kept as free as possible from dust and 
dirt. Or put dried rose petals in an 
earthenware or glass vessel, cover 
with olive oil, and simmer with very 



quantity of high-grade olive oil. Put 
a layer of petals in the empty bot- 
tle, sprinkle over them a small quan- 
tity of fine salt, and cover with 
a layer of absorbent cotton dipped in 
olive oil. So continue until the bot- 
tle is filled. Close it tightly with a 
glass stopper, a piece of bladder, 
parchment, or rubber cloth, and ex- 
pose to the sun. In from ten to 



696 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



twenty days squeeze out the oil, 
which will be found nearly equal to 
the commercial article. 

Or arrange the flowers in the same 
manner in an earthen jar and simmer 
with gentle heat by means of a dou- 
ble boiler, changing the flowers oc- 
casionally until the odor is satisfac- 
tory. Rectified spirits may be added, 
and the whole squeezed and strained 
for use. 

Rose Jar. — Many artistic vases 
with suitable lids can be purchased 
for this purpose, and these make very 
acceptable holiday gifts; or an earth- 
enware or glass vessel, such as a fruit 
jar which can be tightly closed, may 
be employed. 

Gather fresh roses on a clear day 
when the petals are dry. Place these 
petals in the rose jar in layers, cov- 
ering each with a thin layer of com- 
mon salt. Then add two or three 
handfuls each of lavender flowers, 
rosemary leaves, and sweet marjo- 
ram. Other flowers may be added if 
desired, or a jar may be filled en- 
tirely with rose petals. Add 4 ounces 
of pulverized bay salt and 1 ounce 
each of various spices, as cloves, cin- 
namon, grated nutmeg, and the like, 
also orris root, storax, or indeed any 
other perfumes that may be pre- 
ferred. The jar is to be kept closely 
covered, except when perfume is de- 
sired. Then the lid may be removed 
and the contents slightly moistened. 

Potpourri. — This is a mixture of 
dried flowers and spices not ground. 
To make it, take dried lavender flow- 
ers, 1 pound; dried rose leaves, 1 
pound; crushed orris root, i pound; 
crushed cloves, 2 ounces; crushed 
cinnamon, 2 ounces; crushed allspice, 
2 ounces; table salt, 1 pound. 

To Prepare Tinctures. — A tincture 
of flowers having strong perfume, as 
the tuberose, jasmine, violet, jonquil, 
and heliotrope, may be prepared by 
crowding the fresh blossoms into a 
fruit jar and covering them with alco- 
hol. After they have stood for a few 
days, the mixture may be strained 
through a linen cloth, the flowers 
squeezed to extract as much of the 
essence as possible, and fresh flowers 
added. 
Or glycerin may be scented for the 



toilet and bath with any desired odor 
by the same method. 

Or put half-inch layers of any 
flowers in an earthen pot or glass jar 
with layers of fine salt between. 
Screw the top on tightly and place 
the jar in a cellar or other dark, cool 
place. This process requires from 
one to two months. At the end of 
this time strain and squeeze the liq- 
uor through a cloth, put it into a glass 
bottle, and let it stand in the sun to 
clarif}'. 

Or place dry rose or other petals 
in a large bottle or fruit jar, cover 
with alcohol or other rectified spirits, 
close tightly, and preserve for use. A 
few drops of this tincture sprinkled 
about a room will give it a delicious 
perfume. 

Geranium Perfume. — A perfume 
which is very agreeable to many may 
be made by either of the above meth- 
ods from the leaves of any of the 
sweet-smelling geraniums. The tinc- 
ture, obtained b}'^ packing the leaves 
in a fruit jar, filling it with alcohol 
and allowing it to stand for a few 
weeks, is perhaps the easiest to pre- 
pare. The leaves may be renewed, if 
desired, to strengthen the perfume. 

Smelling^ Salts. — The base of the 
best quality of smelling salts is the 
true neutral carbonate of ammonia. 
This is a volatile salt which keeps its 
pungency as long as it lasts. The por- 
tion exposed to the air as it volatilizes 
separates into carbonic-acid gas and 
gaseous ammonia. Care should be 
taken in ordering to procure the true 
carbonate of ammonia and not the ses- 
quicarbonate, which does not possess 
an equally strong, agreeable, or last- 
ing pungency. 

Smelling salts may be prepared by 
putting the carbonate of ammonia in 
a suitable glass bottle with a stopper 
of ground glass, and adding any de- 
sired perfume, as 8 parts of carbo- 
nate of ammonia to 1 part of oil of 
lavender, or a suitable quantity of 
other essential oils, as bergamot, 
cloves, cassia, verbena, and the like. 

Or put equal quantities of slaked 
lime and carbonate of ammonia in a 
glass-stoppered bottle, cover with 
aqua ammonia, and add 12 to 20 drops 
of any desired essential oil or oils. 



TOILET PREPARATIONS 



697 



Or put in a glass-stoppered bottle 
absorbent cotton or a small sponge 
cut up into fine pieces. Fill with com- 
mon liquid ammonia, and add 5 or 6 
drops each of various essential oils 
according to taste. 

Perfumed Waters. — A substitute 
for rose water and other distilled wa- 
ters may be quickly prepared by 
dropping the essential oil or attar of 
rose or other substances into distilled 
boiling water. The water should be 
taken off the fire at a boil, the oil 
dropped in, and stirred vigorously 
while cooling. 

Rose Water. — Dissolve 1 dram of 
attar of rose, or a proportionate 
quantity of other essential oils, in 1 
pint of rectified spirits; while hot 
place in a 2-gallon jug and add If 
gallons of pure distilled water, heated, 
but not quite to the boiling point — 
say 190°, Cork the jug and shake, 
cautiously at first but thoroughly aft- 
erwards, until cold. This form of 
rose water will be found equal to the 
commercial article. 

Or drop 12 drops of attar of rose 
on a half oimce of cube sugar. Add 
2 drams of carbonate of magnesia. 
Put in a fruit jar and pour in gradu- 
ally 1 quart of water, stirring briskly. 
Add 2 ounces of rectified spirits. 
Place a funnel of filtering paper in an- 
other fruit jar, and pour through 
the funnel to filter. The effect of the 
magnesia is to break up the oil glob- 
ules and assist in forming an emul- 
sion with water. The magnesia is 
removed by filtering. Other per- 
fumed waters may be prepared in a 
similar manner. 

Violet Water. — Put 1 pint of alco- 
hol or proof spirits in a quart fruit 
jar. Add 1 pound of orris root, cov- 
er, and shake. Let stand on the dregs 
for a week or 10 days. Filter through 
filter paper to remove the orris root. 

Or mix deodorized alcohol, 15 
ounces; rose water, 2 ounces; extract 
of cassia, 1 ounce; and extract of 
violet, 9 ounces. Mix, shake, and fil- 
ter. 

Or mix 1 pint of alcohol and 1 
ounce each of neroli and essence of 
violets. 

lavender Water. — A favorite arti- 
cle for the toilet is the oil of lavender 



diluted with rectified alcohol, to 
which various other perfumes may be 
added according to taste. To pre- 
pare lavender water, it is onlv neces- 
sary to first mix the oil of lavender 
and other essential oils (if any) with 
a little of the alcohol; then add the 
remaining alcohol in a thin stream, 
stirring constantly. Finally stir in 
the other ingredients. The whole 
should be placed in a glass fruit jar 
with rubber rings, or other closely 
stoppered vessel, and allowed to stand 
for several months before using. It 
should be sliaken frequently. The 
longer it can be allowed to stand be- 
fore being opened the better the 
quality will be. The English oil of 
lavender is the best. 

Other perfumed toilet waters may 
be prepared by substituting any of 
the essential oils, according to taste, 
in the following tables. 

Perfumed Toilet Waters.— The 
number of possible combinations of 
perfumes diluted with distilled or 
soft water, which form the perfumed 
toilet waters of commerce, is of 
course, unlimited. The following ex- 
amples illustrate the method of com- 
bining these, and may be recom- 
mended to be as desirable as any: 

Put in a pint glass bottle or fruit 
jar ^ ounce of oil of rosemary and 
1 dram of essence of ambergris; add 
1 pint of 95 per cent alcohol. Shake 
well, remove the cork, and let stand 
S4 hours. Then cork tightly and let 
stand a month or 6 weeks, shaking 
frequently, after which put in a 
tightly stoppered bottle until ready 
for use. This is the well-known 
" Hungary water." 

Or put In a 2-quart fruit jar 1 
ounce of oil of bergamot, i ounce of 
tincture of benzoin, 1 dram of oil of 
cinnamon, and cover with 1 quart of 
95 per cent alcohol. Let stand a 
month or weeks, shake frequently, 
filter, and put in a tightly stoppered 
glass bottle. This is a standard 
recipe for •' Florida water." 

Or, for a simjile " Florida water," 
put in a corked fruit jar i ounce of 
oil of bergamot, i ounce of tincture 
of benzoin, and i pint of 95 per cent 
alcohol. Dilute with pure soft or dis- 
tilled water to the extent desired. 



CHAPTER XL VI 
CARE OF THE HAIR 

DANDRUFF AND SHAMPOOING — HAIR WASHES — HAIR TONICS 
— HAIR DYES — OTHER HAIR TOPICS 



Hairdressing. — The subject of 
hairdressing, while of interest to both 
sexes, is especially important to 
women, both because the mass and 
length of their hair render it difficult 
to handle and keep clean, and also 
because any peculiarities it may have 
are very conspicuous. This subject 
is not only of interest to every woman 
for herself, but it may also be men- 
tioned among the many methods of 
earning pin money in small communi- 
ties. In neighborhoods wher'e there 
is no professional hairdresser any 
woman with natural deftness and 
taste can earn a good many dollars 
by caring for ladies' and children's 
hair, doing up ladies' hair in proper 
style for parties, and also by teach- 
ing inexperienced persons, for a small 
fee, how to do up their own hair in 
the latest style of coiffure. The in- 
formation contained in the following 
paragraphs can thus be put to prac- 
tical use and turned into dollars and 
cents. The attention of neighbors can 
be called to a woman's willingness to 
serve them in this manner by having 
a few business cards printed and giv- 
ing them to one's friends to distrib- 
ute among their acquaintances, or by 
means of a reading notice or business 
card in a local paper, which may be 
paid for by services to the wife or 
family of the editor. 

Nature of the Hair. — The hair, 
like the nails, is formed of the same 
horny substance as that which ap- 
pears on the outer surface of the 
skin when it becomes callous. Each 
hair, on the other hand, has a well- 
developed root which runs deep into 



the skin. The pigments which give 
the hair its color are present in light 
hair as well as dark, except that gray 
hairs may not contain them. Some- 
times gray hairs are produced by the 
splitting of the hair in such a way 
as to admit the air. The daily 
growth of the hair is about one twen- 
tieth of an inch. It normally con- 
tinues to grow for several years, and 
reaches from 18 inches to 1 yard in 
length. The hair is subject to va- 
rious diseases, and may be affected 
by the constitutional results of wast- 
ing and infectious ailments, such as 
typhoid fever, and also by severe 
emotions, such as fright, grief, and 
the like. Many preparations are ad- 
vertised which claim that they will 
infallibly promote the growth of the 
hair. It cannot be too strongly em- 
phasized that all such claims are hum- 
bugs. 

Care of the Hair. — The proper 
care of the hair under normal con- 
ditions is very simple. The objects 
to be kept in mind are to preserve its 
natural luster and texture by means 
of absolute cleanliness, and to mas- 
sage the scalp sufficiently to remove 
any scurf or dandruff that may ad- 
here to it, and thereby promote the 
active circulation of the blood. All 
this must be done without injury to 
the scalp or the hair by pulling, 
scratching, or tearing. Cutting the 
hair frequently has a tendency, es- 
pecially in youth, to thicken the indi- 
vidual hairs and promote their 
growth. Neither this nor any other 
known process, however, tends to in- 
crease the actual number of hairs.

CARE OF THE HAIR 



699 



All claims to the contrary are the 
pretentions of charlatans. 

Professional hairdressers do not 
advocate shampooing the hair oftener 
than once a month. A thorough 
brushing once or twice a week is re- 
garded by them as sufficient for 
cleanliness and as much more bene- 
ficial to the hair and scalp. 

Much contradictory advice has been 
given on the subject of brushing the 
hair, some persons saying that stiflF 
brushes should be used and the scalp 
and hair brushed by means of them 
with a good deal of vigor; others rec- 
ommending soft brushes and a very 
moderate amount of friction. These 
differences are probably due to differ- 
ent views of the objects to be ob- 
tained by brushing. One object is to 
promote the health of the scalp and 
hence to give strength and vigor to 
the hair. For this purpose brushes 
with hard, stiff bristles may be used 
with considerable vigor, provided the 
skin is not injured. The other object 
is to smooth the hair and free it from 
dust. For this purpose brushes may 
be soft and used with a very moderate 
pressure. 

Care should be taken, on the one 
hand, not to scratch the scalp, tear 
the roots of the hair, or cause it to 
split; and on the other, not to neglect 
the stimulating effects of massaging 
the scalp and removing dandruff. In 
other words, a vigorous brushing 
should be directed to the head or 
scalp, the gentler stroke being em- 
ployed in brushing the hair itself. 

The general opinion is that it is 
feasible to brush the hair free from 
dust each night before retiring. Ap- 
plications of tonics and restoratives 
should also be made at this time, as 
they have the best opportunity of 
doing their work during sleep and es- 
pecially while the blood is circulating 
freely as the result of brushing. The 
care of the hair must be governed by 
common sense, and general rules 
must be adapted to individual con- 
ditions. Some persons find it neces- 
sary to wash the hair as often as 
twice a month, and with others once 
a month is sufficient. When the hair 
is oily it should not be brushed as 
freely or frequently as otherwise. 



When it is dry and harsh the appli- 
cation of lanolin or other pomades 
may be necessary. 

An analogy may be found in the 
grooming of horses. Every good 
groom knows by experience that 
plenty of combing and brushing not 
only produces a fine coat but pro- 
motes the health and vitality of the 
animal. Hence brushes with moder- 
ately stiff bristles should be cho- 
sen. 

For men the so-called military or 
broad double brushes, one for each 
hand, are to be preferred. 

To Dry-clean the Hair. — To thor- 
oughly cleanse the hair it should be 
brushed successively from partings 
made in all directions upon the scalp, 
the utmost care being taken that for- 
eign matter accumulated on the brush 
is removed and not returned by the 
next stroke to the hair. 

Professional hairdressers when giv- 
ing the hair a dry cleaning run a 
comb through the brush each time 
the latter is drawn through the hair, 
and afterwards wipe the comb clean 
on a towel. The object of this proc- 
ess is to remove dirt and dandruff 
and bring about the additional soft- 
ness resulting from perfect cleanli- 
ness. If this is not done, the natural 
oil of the hair mixing with foreign 
substances merely makes the hair 
sticky. 

Care of Hairbrushes. — Brushes 
should be cleaned very often and 
thoroughly, as a surprising amount 
of dust and dirt gathers in the hair. 
This quickly accumulates in the 
brushes and fills them. Hence the 
brush should be cleaned immediately 
after using. 

Substances recommended for this 
purpose are gasoline, ammonia, borax, 
and sal soda, of which the last is 
least desirable. It is also a good 
plant to disinfect the brush by put- 
ting a few drops of carbolic acid in 
the water. Neither hot water nor 
soap should be used, and the bristles 
should be allowed to dry thoroughly 
before using them. The effect of hot 
water and soap is to soften the bris- 
tles and also the glue with which they 
are commonly fastened into the 
brush, and when soft, the bristles are 



700 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



likely to split and break off or fall 
out. 

To Clean a Hairbrush. — First 
comb out the loose hair with a coarse 
comb. Turn the brush downward 
and strike the bristles on a smooth, 
solid surface to loosen the dust and 
dandruff. Then rub the bristles over 
a Turkish or other coarse towel to 
wipe off as much of the loosened dust 
as possible. 

To Wash a Brush. — Take two 
bowls of cold water in which to wash 
and to rinse the brush respectively. 
In one put about 1 tablespoonful of 
ammonia to 1 pint of water, and in- 
troduce the bristles in this without 
immersing the back of the brush. 
Rub the bristles back and forth with 
the hand in the water until they are 
clean. 

Or, to assist in cleaning them, re- 
move the brush from the water and 
brush the dust and dirt out of it 
with a clean, stiff' whisk broom which 
will work down into the bristles. Af- 
terwards rinse in clear water in the 
same way. 

Or add about 2 or 3 teaspoonfuls 
of alum to 1 pint of water, and rinse 
the bristles in this to toughen 
them. 

Wipe the bristles back and forth on 
a clean, dry towel, and hang up the 
brush by the handle to dry, or better 
still, lay it down in the draught with 
the bristles down. Never lay a wet 
brush down on the back, as this per- 
mits the water to run down the bris- 
tles and soak the glue with which 
they are fastened to the back. Do 
not expose a wet brush to direct sun- 
shine or other drying heat, as too 
rapid drying has a tendency to warp 
or crack the back of the brush. 

To Clean Combs. — A wire brush or 
whisk broom is the best means to 
clean gtitta-percha combs, and is 
preferable to soaking them in water. 

Or they may be washed in either of 
the solutions recommended above for 
washing brushes. 

DANDRUFF AND SHAMPOOING 

Dandruff. — Dandruff is a very 
conmion disease. It is caused by the 
formation of a scurf on the scalp 



which becomes detached in fine, dry 
scales. Unless these scales are re- 
moved from the hair by frequent 
brushing they give it a dry and his- 
terless ap])earance. They also tend 
to accumulate on clothing and to give 
the impression of undeanliness. Ad- 
vertised pre])a rations for the cure of 
dandruff are not only usually of no 
avail, contrary to the claims which 
are so persistently advertised in their 
favor, but are often positively inju- 
rious. 

Among the causes of dandruff may 
be mentioned weakness of the scalp 
from infectious diseases or otherwise, 
pressure of heavy and close hats and 
caps or of the hair matted upon the 
scalp, excessive use of hair oils and 
dyes, and other causes. These condi- 
tions should be avoided as much as 
possible, and the scalp should be kept 
perfectly clean, with due attention to 
instructions already given for its care. 
Hygienic measures for the improve- 
ment of the general health are also 
very important. Substances which 
are especially recommended for dan- 
druff are yolks of eggs with chloro- 
form, borax with or without camphor, 
carboUc acid, soda, and chlorate of 
potash. 

Add 10 drops of chloroform to tlie 
yolk of an egg, and beat with an egg 
beater to a stiff consistency. Rub 
the size of an English walnut of this 
mixture into the scalp with the tips 
of the fingers, taking care to rub it 
thoroughl}' into the roots of the hair. 
Afterwards wash the scalp with Cas- 
tile or lanolin soa]), and dry thor- 
oughly with a soft towel. Some phy- 
sicians claim that this is the only 
remedy for dandruff that is at once 
harmless and efficacious. 

Or dissolve 1 oimce of flowers of 
sulphur in 1 quart of water. Shake 
frequently while dissolving. Allow 
the solution to stand until it settles, 
and saturate the hair witli the clear 
liquor night and morning. 

Or mix 2 ounces of glycerin with 
i dram of carbolic acid and 1 dram 
of oil of bergamot or other perfume. 
Rub this mixture into the roots of 
the hair with the finger tips and af- 
terwards use bay rum. This tends to 
keep the hair and scalp in good con-

tlition and to prevent the formation 
of dandruff. 

Or dissolve 1 thimbleful of pow- 
dered borax in 1 teacup ful of water. 
Rub this mixture into the scalp with 
the fingers, and follow with a brisk 
brushing. Where the dandruff is 
plentiful, use this mixture daily for 
a week. Afterwards use twice a 
week until a cure is effected. 

To Shampoo the Hair. — Shampoo- 
ing is a word which means cleansing 
the head and hair. The base of the 
best shamjioo mixtures is undoubt- 
edly yolk of egg. Castile soap, how- 
ever, is highly recommended. I3orax, 
ammonia, sal soda, and salts of tar- 
tar are added on account of their 
cleansing properties; alcohol or bay 
rum to cut the oily substances and 
as preservatives; distilled water and 
rose water for convenience of appli- 
cation. 

Perhaps the best of all shampoos 
is the yolk of an egg beaten up with 
a pint of soft warm water. Apply at 
once, and rinse off with warm water 
and castile or other hard white soap. 

Or add 6 drops of chloroform to 
the above. 

Or salts of tartar may be used for 
this purpose and is commonly em- 
ployed by barbers. Dissolve ^ ounce 
of salts of tartar in 1 pint of soft 
water; apply freely and rub to a 
lather. Wash with soft warm water 
and castile soap. 

Or dissolve 1 ounce of salts of tar- 
tar in li pints of soft water. Add 
1 ounce of castile soap in shavings 
and 4 ounces of bay rum. The salts 
of tartar will remove dandruff, and 
the soap will cleanse the hair and 
scalp. 

After using a shampoo mixture, a 
little vaseline, oil, or pomade should 
be rubbed into the hair to take the 
place of the natural oil which is 
washed out in the shampooing. 

Or pea flour or almond meal is rec- 
ommended for cleansing the hair and 
scalp. The hair should first be 
washed with cold water, and a small 
handful of pea flour or almond meal, 
as preferred, rubbed into it for five 
or ten minutes. Fresh water should 
be added from time to time until a 
perfect lather forms. The whole 



head should then be rinsed clean, 
dried with a soft towel, and brushed 
thoroughly. This process thoroughly 
cleanses the hair and tends to give it 
a soft, silky texture. It is also said 
to be invigorating to the scalp. 

To Compound Shampoos. — When 
yolk of egg is employed it should be 
beaten stiff with an egg beater, other 
dry materials added, and the whole 
diluted by adding distilled water 
slowly, and stirring briskly with an 
egg beater or otherwise to form an 
emulsion or thin paste. For the ideal 
egg shampoo, however, see above un- 
der "Dandruff." 

For other remedies, bring distilled 
water to a boil, take it off the stove, 
dissolve in it such substances as cas- 
tile soap, sal soda, borax, etc., add 
bay rum and spirits if desired, strain 
through linen, and allow to cool be- 
fore perfumes are added. 

To Apply Shampoo Mixtures. — 
Apply about a tablespoonful of a 
good shampoo mixture, rubbing it 
into the scalp with the tips of the 
fingers and working it in thoroughlJ^ 
Massage with the hands until a fine 
lather is produced. Afterwards rinse 
with clear soft water, first hot then 
cold, dry the hair with a coarse 
towel, and apply a little oil or poma- 
tum, if desired, to take the place of 
the natural oil which has been re- 
moved from the hair by this process. 

Dry-hair Shampoo. — Mix 4 ounces 
of powdered orris root with 1 ounce 
of talcum powder, and sprinkle free- 
ly through the hair. This absorbs the 
superfluous oil and gives the hair a 
very thick and fluffy appearance. It 
is especially useful to persons whose 
hair is heavy and oily. It is also 
cooling and cleansing to the scalp. 

HAIR WASHES 

The solid and semisolid bases com- 
monly found in toilet preparations 
are naturally to a great degree ab- 
sent from those given here. The base 
of these washes is usually soft water, 
rose water, eau de cologne, or some 
form of spirits in which the remedial 
agencies and perfumes are held in 
solution. Preparations containing al- 
cohol and other spirits should be

used with caution, as by evaporation 
they tend to dry the scalp and also to 
deprive the hair of its natural oil, 
which gives normally a perfect luster. 
Such substances as castile soap, am- 
monia, sal soda, salts of tartar, borax, 
and the like are often added for 
their cleansing properties. The prin- 
cipal remedial agents recommended 
are such substances as cantharides, 
arnica, camphor, sulphur, iron sul- 
phate, and the like, and various veg- 
etable infusions. These are employed 



a handful of rosemary lea%'es, and 
add A tablespoonful of carbonate of 
ammonia. Cork tightly and let stand 
over night, shake well, and strain 
through cheese cloth. Preserve in a 
tightly stoppered bottle. 

Or mix 2 ounces of sal soda and 
1 ounce of cream of tartar. Dilute 
with soft water to any desired con- 
sistency. 

Or dissolve 1 tablespoonful of aqua 
ammonia and 1 teaspoonful of borax 
in 1 quart of soft water. Wash the

for certain specific properties bene- 
ficial to the scalp. As in other sim- 
ilar toilet preparations, rose, elder- 
flower, orange-flower, rosemary, and 
other waters may be used, according 
to taste, and the same may be said 
of the various perfumes. 

Nothing, perhaps, is better to 
cleanse the hair than diluted am- 
monia water — 1 part of aqua am- 
monia to 10 parts of water. The hair 
and scalp should afterwards be well 
rinsed with clear warm water. 

Or pour 1 pint of boiling water on 



hair thoroughly and rub dry with a 
towel. 

Or dissolve 20 grains of salts of 
tartar in 1 pint of soft water, and 
add li ounces of glycerin. 

Care, however, should be taken not 
to use these preparations too fre- 
quently. Once or twice a month is 
often enough to wash the hair in this 
manner unless it is unusually oily, 
and it should be borne in mind that 
the use of hair washes, by depriving 
the liair of its natural oil, has a 
tendency to make it harsh and dry, 



CARE OF THE HAIR

and hence tends to split it. After 
the use of washes of this sort a little 
vaseline, hair oil, or pomatum maj'^ be 
rubbed into the hair to replace the 
natural oil. 

Compounding Hair Washes. — 
When the solid substances, as rose- 
mary or bay leaves, saffron wood, 
southernwood, and the like are rec- 
ommended, they are prepared by 
boiling in the water or other liquid 
for fifteen or twenty minutes to make 
a strong infusion. Next strain, add 
such solids as castile soap (in shav- 
ings), borax, sal soda, and the like 
while the liquor is warm enough to 
dissolve them, and reserve the per- 
fumes until it becomes cool. 

HAIR TONICS 

Loosening and Falling Out of the 
Hair. — This often takes place as the 
result of infectious diseases, on ac- 
count of the weakening of the scalp. 
Contrary to common belief, it is prob- 
ably never due to results of dissij^a- 
tion and excesses. Hygenic measures 
to improve the general health come 
first in importance. The use of tar 
soap and the yolk of egg is beneficial. 
To plunge the head into cold water 
night and morning, and afterwards 
to dry the hair, brushing the scalp 
briskly to a warm glow, is beneficial 
for men so affected. The recipes for 
various tonics and lotions will be 
given containing all the known specific 
remedial agents, and persons threat- 
ened with baldness are earnestly ad- 
vised to compound their own remedies 
and not purchase advertised nos- 
trums. 

Dry and Harsh Hair. — This condi- 
tion of the hair may be improved by 
shampooing the scalp with yolk of 
egg, as recommended for dandruff, or 
the scalp may be washed with a weak 
solution of green tea applied cold, or 
with an emulsion of castile soap con 
taining a small quantity of tannin. 
Alcohol in any form is highly objec- 
tionable, as it tends by rapid evapo- 
ration to increase the dryness of the 
scalp. Shampooing the scalp occa- 
sionally with a good shampoo mix- 
ture is also useful. This condition 
may occur from too frequent wash- 



ing of the scalp with soap or other 
substances that deprive it of its nat- 
ural oils. 

Baldness. — Absolute baldness is a 
condition in which the follicles or 
roots of the hair have lost their vi- 
tality. It is absolutely incurable. 
Hence preventive measures should be 
taken as soon as there is any indica- 
tion of a tendency to baldness, as 
shown by the falling out or loosening 
of the hair. The basis of most hair 
invigorators and restorers is some 
form of cantharides or quinine. A 
number of simple household remedies 
have been recommended which are 
harmless and maj'^ be tried by any 
one, among these being sage tea, Ja- 
maica rum, lemon juice, vinegar, salt 
water, lobelia, onion juice, boxwood, 
and ammonia. 

Instructions for the use of these 
homemade remedies are as fol- 
lows: 

Mix 1 pint of strong sage tea, 1 
pint of bay rum, and 1 or 2 ounces, 
more or less, of glycerin, depending 
upon the amount of natural oil in the 
hair; or substitute neat's-foot oil for 
glycerin if the latter does not suit the 
skin. Shake the mixture well and 
apply with the finger tips to the 
scalp, rubbing thoroughly into the 
roots of the hair every night. This 
tends to prevent the hair from turn- 
ing gray. 

Or pour boiling water on rock salt 
or sea salt, using 2 heaping table- 
spoonfuls to 1 quart of water, and 
allow it to cool before using. Use as 
a wash daily. 

Or steep in a covered saucepan for 
15 or 20 minutes 4 large handfuls 
of the leaves of the common box, 
such as is used for garden borders. 
Let the decoction stand over night. 
Strain through a linen cloth and add 
^ ounce of cologne or lavender water. 
Use as a wash daily. 

Hair Tonics. — Tlie principal reme- 
dial agents in proprietary articles 
usually known as invigorators or res- 
toratives for the hair are the va- 
rious preparations of cantharides 
(usually the vinegar or tincture), 
quinine (either in the form of cin- 
chona bark or quinine sulphate), car- 
bonate of ammonia, tincture of ar-

nica, an infusion of the tendrils of 
the grapevine, and various astringent 
substances. These preparations may 
be based on solid unguents, as lard, 
whitewax, spermaceti, or beef mar- 
row; or on liquid unguents, as sweet, 
olive, cocoanut, or other oil, espe- 
cially castor oil, which is thought to 
be a specific for promoting the

as borax and ammonia, are frequent-

may be perfumed with the various es- 
sential oils according to taste. They 
require only mixing. Hence it is suf- 
ficient to give the formulas in the

various vehicles, as alcohol, eau de

and the like. Jamaica rum, with or 
without the oil of bay, and sherry 



should be shaken well before using 
and applied daily, being well rubbed 
into the roots of the hair until it 
stops falling out, or is otherwise in 
a satisfactory condition. 



CARE OF THE HAIR

The following is an especially rec- 
ommended recipe: put in a glass bot- 
tle 8 ounces of 95 per cent alcohol; 
add i ounce of glycerin, 8 grains 
of sulphate of quinine, 1* grains of 
tincture cantharides, 2i ' drams of 
tincture rhotany, and * ounce of es- 
sence of lavender. Mix and shake 
well before using. 

Compounding Hair Tonics. — In 
compounding the various hair tonics 
in the preceding table the solids, as 
black tea, bay leaves, and the like, 
must be boiled fifteen or twenty min- 
utes to produce an infusion, and then 
strained through a linen cloth. Cin- 
chona bark and jaborandi should be 
first reduced in a mortar to a fine 
powder before boiling. Solid un- 
guents must be melted with gentle 
heat, oils cut in alcohol or other spir- 
its, and remedial agents added while 
the mixture is still hot enough to dis- 
solve them readily. The whole should 
then be removed from the fire, thor- 
oughly mixed by beating with an egg 
beater or otherwise, and strained 
through a linen cloth to remove the 
dregs. The essential oils and other 
volatile perfumes, if any, should be 
reserved until the liquid is nearly 
cold, to prevent loss by evaporation. 

HAIR DYES 

Dyeing as a means of changing the 
normal color of the hair is now very 
little resorted to, except by a small 
number of thoughtless girls and wom- 
en who are misled by ignorant or in- 
terested persons. This practice is re- 
garded by all intelligent persons as 
an unmistakable mark of vulgarity. 
Even the young men themselves, who 
are supposed, if any are, to be de- 
ceived and attracted by this process, 
have coined the expression " chemical 
blonde " and " peroxide blonde " to 
define a woman who has been deluded 
into following this silly fad, and 
boast themselves able to recognize 
such an individual at sight. 

There is more justification for the 
use of hair dyes in case of premature 
grayness and" especially in those pe- 
culiar cases where irregular patches 
of gray hair make their appearance. 
The causes of these conditions are 



not fully understood. It is well 
known that the hair may turn gray 
suddenly as a consequence of extreme 
emotion, fright, pain, and the like. 
Patches of gray hair are sometimes 
attributed to fungous growths at the 
roots. Even in these cases, however, 
it is usually better to avoid taking a 
plunge into the unknown. The difB- 
culties connected with dyeing the hair 
are many, and the injurious conse- 
quences are inevitable. Such a sub- 
stance as a harmless hair dye is not 
known, all claims to the contrary 
notwithstanding. Neither is it possi- 
ble to deceive any one. The natural 
color of the hair is subtly blended by 
nature with the tints and shades of 
the complexion, and any change in 
the color of the hair will produce an 
unnatural disparity which the prac- 
ticed eye readily detects. Men might 
perhaps be deceived, but women 
never. And the man or woman who 
adopts the use of hair dyes speedily 
becomes the subject of more or less 
invidious gossip and ridicule. The 
practice is usually begun with the 
idea that a single application will be 
sufficient. This is not the case. The 
hair grows at the rate of about one 
twentieth of an inch each day; hence 
in a few days a new growth appears 
and a fresh application of the dye 
becomes necessary. Meantime the dye 
has injured the hair and in many 
cases the scalp, brain, and nervous 
system. All preparations of lead, 
silver, and other mineral substances 
are distinctly and often fatally inju- 
rious. We have excluded from this 
book all preparations of this char- 
acter, but in deference to the wishes 
of those who have a legitimate 
reason for wishing to darken the 
color of the hair, we give a number 
of recipes which are as efficacious as 
any that can be recommended with 
safety. 

Hair Dyes. — A careful examination 
of more than 100 counted recipes for 
hair dyes recommended in otherwise 
reputable books of household recipes 
discloses none which do not contain 
injurious mineral substances, except 
those we give below. 

Recent chemical analysis of widely 
advertised hair dyes and washes for

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



bleaching, darkening, or otherwise 
changing the color of the hair dis- 
closes the presence of these mineral 
agents in i)ractically every instance, 
notwithstanding the fact that in all 
cases the proprietors announce that 
the preparations are " harmless." 
Among the injurious substances rec- 
ommended are the following: 

Nitric, muriatic, and sulphuric 
acids; bismuth; lead, as litharge and 
the acetate or sugar of lead, etc.; 
antimony, silver (usually the ni- 
trate), potassium, baryta, iron, tin, 
copper, etc. These metals are rec- 
ommended in the form of various 
salts, as sulphates, acetates, chlorides, 
and the like. They are each and all 
vicious in principle and injurious in 
practice, and those who knowingly or 
unknowingly recommend them should 
be regarded with suspicion. 

To Prevent Gray Hair. — A pre- 
ventive against grayness of the hair 
has already been mentioned, i. e., the 
yolk of egg. Preparations containing 
neat's-foot oil are also beneficial for 
darkening the hair. The action of 
hair dyes in pomades is necessarily 
slow, and they must be used daily or 
frequently until the proper results 
have been secured. Compounds con- 
taining vegetable ingredients are bet- 
ter than those containing mineral 
ones. Among materials which are 
relatively harmless are stains from 
walnut shells and green walnuts, 
which gradually dye light hair to 
dark-brown shades. These have to be 
used constantly, as the color is not 
durable. These stains cannot be used 
in the form of pomades. Henna and 
indigo powders produce various 
shades from yellow to dark brown, 
and other compounds and substances 
are mentioned below. " Chemical 
blondes " wash the hair with greatly di- 
luted hydrogen peroxide. When dyes 
are applied to the hair it should first 
be thoroughly cleansed of its natural 
oils and other foreign substances. 
This may be done by washing the hair 
with a mixture containing one fourth 
part of chloroform and three fourths 
of alcohol. Gloves should be worn, 
and the dye worked into the hair with 
a comb and a clean toothbrush. 

Or mix 1 part of bay rum, 3 parts 



of neat's-foot oil, and 1 part of 
French brandy by measure. Use this 
as a hair wash daily. Shake well be- 
fore applying. 
Or into 1 gallon of new milk put 
2 quarts of the green tendrils of the 
grapevine. Add 2 pounds of honey 
and a handful of rosemary. Simmer 
slowly until the bulk is reduced 
about one half. Strain through a 
linen cloth and apply to the hair fre- 
quently. 

An excess of lime in the system is 
said to have a tendency to make the 
hair brittle and cause it to split and 
crack. This, by admitting air to the 
hair, is the most common cause of 
grayness. Hence hard water for 
drinking purposes should be avoided, 
or softened by means elsewhere rec- 
ommended. 

Walnut Hair Dye. — Press the juice 
from the bark or shells of green wal- 
nuts. Add a small quantity of recti- 
fied alcohol and a little allspice or a 
few cloves. Let the mixture stand 
for a week or ten days and shake oc- 
casionally. Filter through a linen 
cloth and add a small amount of com- 
mon salt as a preservative. Keep in 
a cool, dark place. 

Yellow Hair Dye. — Boil 1 or 2 
ounces of pure annotto in 1 pint of 
soft or distilled water, adding a pinch 
of baking soda. This gives the hair 
a golden yellow, which, however, va- 
ries according to its strength and the 
original color of the hair. Washing 
the hair in a solution of alum water 
deepens the color. The application of 
a solution of lemon juice or vinegar 
after the use of this dye reddens the 
hair or gives it an orange color. 

Black or Brown Hair Dye. — Boil 2 
ounces of black tea in 1 gallon of 
water. Strain through a linen cloth. 
Add 2 or 3 ounces of glycerin, i 
ounce of tincture of cantharidcs, and 
1 quart of bay rum. Let the mixture 
stand 48 hours, shaking occasionally, 
and perfume with any essential oil 
preferred. 

Black Hair Dye. — Mix juice of 
green walnuts as above described with 
neat's-foot oil, using about 1 part of 
the oil to 4 parts of walnut juice ac- 
cording to the amount of natural oil 
present in the hair. 



CARE OF THE HAIR 



707 



Red Hair Dye. — Make a strong de- 
coction of safflowers or of alkanet by 
boiling either in water to which a 
small amount of baking soda has been 
added. This gives the hair a bright- 
red or reddish-yellow color, accord- 
ing to its strength. When the hair is 
dry after this application, wash with 
a solution of lemon juice or vinegar 
mixed with an equal quantity of 
water. 

Or, to darken red hair, mix 1 dram 
each of oil of nutmeg and rosemary, 
1 ounce of castor oil, 2 drams of tinc- 
ture of cantharides, and 8 ounces of 
French brandy. Work a teaspoonful 
or more of this into the hair each day 
with a moderately stiff brush, brush- 
ing 12 to 20 minutes. 

OTHER HAIR TOPICS 

Superfluous Hair. — There is no 
known method which is entirely sat- 
isfactory for removing superfluous 
hairs. Among the various methods 
recommended are shaving, plucking 
out the hairs with tweezers, the use 
of the electric needle, and various de- 
pilatories. The active principle in 
these compounds is usually chloride 
of lime, quicklime, or sulphide of ar- 
senic. These cause the hair shafts to 
fall out, but do not affect the root of 
the hair, and hence must be frequent- 
ly repeated. These substances are 
strong irritants and unless handled 
intelligently may create ugly ulcers. 

Shaving stimulates the growth of 
the hair and by thickening it in- 
creases the discoloration caused by 
the ends of the hair shafts showing 
through the skin. Plucking the hairs 
perseveringly by the roots, the skin 
having been previously softened and 
prepared by the application of a suit- 
able toilet emulsion, is perhaps the 
most satisfactory method. 

A competent operator supplied 
with the proper apparatus can re- 
move superfluous hair permanently by 
means of the electric needle. Tlie 
electrode from the positive pole of 
the battery is attached to the back of 
the patient's neck or other convenient 
spot. A three-cornered electric nee- 
dle with sharp cutting edges is at- 



tached to the negative pole of the 
battery. This is inserted into the 
skin, alongside the hair, care being 
taken not to penetrate too deeply. 
When the current is applied the 
needle becomes hot and causes bub- 
bles of froth to appear at the point 
where it is inserted. The needle is 
then turned so that the sharp corners 
scrape the adjacent surfaces, and the 
process is continued until the hair is 
loosened and destroyed. The result- 
ing scar is so slight as to be hardly 
noticeable, and if the operation is 
properly conducted the results are 
sure and permanent. The following 
are standard recipes for depilatories. 
These are severe remedies, and should 
be employed only with caution and 
due regard to what has been said 
above. 

Spread equal quantities of galba- 
num and pitch plaster on a piece of 
soft chamois leather. Lay it smooth- 
ly on the superfluous hair and let it 
remain three or four minutes. It may 
then be pulled off, hair and all. The 
inflamed skin may then be rubbed 
with olive oil. 

Or pulverize finely in a mortar 1 
ounce of fresh limestone and 1 dram 
of pure potassa. Soak the parts for 
10 minutes in warm water, so as to 
soften the superfluous hairs. Form a 
paste of the above powder with Avarm 
water, apply with a brush, and re- 
move after 5 or 6 minutes or as soon 
as the skin begins to be inflamed. To 
remove this paste, wash it away with 
vinegar. This softens the skin and 
neutralizes the alkali. 

Or mix equal quantities of sul- 
phuret of calcium and quicklime pul- 
verized to a fine powder. Apply pre- 
cisely as for the preceding. The ac- 
tion is quicker. Hence it should be 
removed after two or three minutes 
in the same manner as the last. 

To Curl the Hair. — Preparations 
recommended for curling the hair are 
usually based upon various more or 
less adhesive substances, as gum ara- 
ble, quince mucilage, beeswax, sper- 
maceti, and the like, mixed with va- 
rious oils and diluted with alcohol or 
Avater. They may be perfumed ac- 
cording to taste. Specific curling

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



properties are claimed for beeswax, 
oil of origanum, mastic, and car- 
bonate of potassium. 

It is also said that when the hair is 
clipped, as is sometimes done with 
children or after a serious illness, if 
the head is shaved " against the 
grain " the hair will come in curly or 
wavy. The use of the egg shampoo 
elsewhere recommended also has the 
same tendency. 

The following recipes are recom- 
mended: 

Put in a double boiler 1 ounce of 
oil of sweet almonds, 1 dram of sper- 
maceti, wliite wax, or beeswax, and 
dissolve with very gentle heat. Re- 
move from the lire, stir in 3 drams of 
tincture of mastic. Bottle and cork 
tightly until wanted. Appl_v a small 
quantity and arrange the hair loosely. 
This is a French preparation and a 
commercial article of considerable 
reputation. 

Or mix 12 ounces of olive oil, 1 
dram of origanum, and 1 dram of oil 
of rosemary. Bottle and cork tightly 
until wanted. Apply every other day. 

Or melt a piece of white beeswax 
about the size of a hickory nut in 1 
ounce of olive oil, and perfume with 
a few drops of oil of neroli. This is 
simple and effective. 

Or beat up the yolk of an egg, rub 
it into the hair, and let dry. Rinse 
off with clear warm water and apply 
a little bandoline or pomade when ar- 
ranging the curls. 

To Compound Curling Fluids. — 
Put the above solids or oils in a 
saucepan and simmer with gentle 
heat. When solids are melted or oil 
is well warmed, add other ingredients, 
except perfume. Strain, cool, and 
add perfume when nearly cold. 

Hair Powders. — The basis of pow- 
ders for the hair was formerly wheat 



starch, but potato farina is now more 
commonly used, as it is whiter and 
more lustrous. This is the ordinary 
plain hair powder of commerce, to 
which may be added for a black pow- 
der powdered charcoal or ivory black, 
or, for a sparkling effect, white frost- 
ing. Various perfumes are used ac- 
cording to taste. These may be used 
as a dry powder in the form of sa- 
chet, or they may be dropped on loaf 
sugar, which is afterwards pulverized 
in a mortar. 

The following preparations are rec- 
ommended : 

Mix and sift together through a fine 
hair or other sieve 8 ounces of pow- 
dered wheat bran and 1 ounce of 
powdered orris root. 

Or mix 8 ounces of starch powder 
with 2 ounces of rose sachet. 

Or, for musk hair powder, mix 1 
scruple of musk with 3 pounds of 
wheat starch or farina. 

Or mix 13 ounces of starch or fa- 
rina with 3 ounces of powdered am- 
bergris; or \-2 ounces of starch or 
farina with 3 ounces of violet sachet. 

Or, for a blond hair powder, mix 
4 ounces each of powdered starch or 
farina and powdered orris root; 
add 1 ounce of powdered yellow 
ocher. 

Or, for a black powder, mix 4 
ounces each of powdered starch or 
farina and powdered orris root, and 
add ^ ounce each of powdered char- 
coal and ivory black. 

Or, for a sparkling effect, grind 
white frostings to a powder in a 
mortar. 

Compounding Hair Powders. — 
These powders are merely mechanical 
mixtures. The ingredients should be 
thoroughly mixed in a mortar or other 
suitable receptacle, or sifted through 
a fine hair or wire sieve. 



CHAPTER XL VII 
THE TEETH 



THE TEETH — DENTIFRICES — THE BREATH — TOOTHACHE 



THE TEETH 

Good Teeth. — Modern dentistry has 
greatly assisted in causing the pub- 
lic to realize the value of a set of 
good teeth, but much still remains to 
be done in this direction. Medical in- 
spectors in the public schools of large 
cities report that a very large per- 
centage of school children have poor 
teeth due to the ignorance or neglect 
of parents. Good teeth are necessary 
to health, speech, and beauty. 

From the standpoint of health, it 
must be remembered that the process 
of digestion begins in the mouth. 
This fact is the basis of the system 
of hygiene known as Fletcherism. 
The originator of this system, after 
having become a chronic dyspeptic, 
cured himself at an advanced age by 
attention to two principles: never 
eating when not hungry, and chewing 
food until all the taste is chewed out 
of it and it disappears without con- 
scious effort of swallowing. The im- 
portance of this last is due to two 
facts. The saliva of the mouth has 
the property of converting starchy 
foods into sugar, thus aiding digestion. 
And food finely divided by proper 
chewing is more readily actecl upon by 
the gastric juice of the stomach. 
Good teeth are, of course, necessary to 
good chewing. If any of the teeth 
are lost, part of the food is likely to 
be swallowed without being properly 
chewed, and the ill effects are no less 
certain because they are not always 
immediately noticed or attributed to 
the true source. 

The teeth play an important part 



in pronunciation, and their loss often 
causes a difficulty in speech which, in 
the case of children, at the age when 
they are learning to pronounce their 
words, may have the effect of retard- 
ing the child's mental development. 

Apertures caused by the loss of 
teeth, or irregularities due to the per- 
manent teeth coming in unevenly, are 
life-long disfigurements. For all of 
these reasons, intelligent and pains- 
taking attention to the teeth is per- 
haps the most important single sub- 
ject in connection with the toilet. 

Bad Teeth. — Decayed teeth show- 
ing cavities in the crown, or having 
decayed roots, are not only painful, 
offensive in appearance and in con- 
taminating the breath, but frequently 
are the direct causes of serious dis- 
turbances of digestion. The tem- 
perature of the mouth is about 96° F. 
or considerably above that of ordi- 
nary summer weather. The humidity 
of the mouth is, of course, high. 
Under these conditions, experience 
teaches that fresh meat and other 
organic matter will decay very rap- 
idly. Hence, particles of food lodged 
in cavities or between the teeth, if 
not removed, decay and afford breed- 
ing places for the bacteria of filth 
diseases. These are swallowed with 
food and upon occasion of any irrita- 
tion of the digestive tract, find lodg- 
ment and give rise to indigestion and 
other troubles. These substances also 
contaminate the breath and become 
highly offensive to others. So that 
absolute cleanliness is an imperative 
duty that every one owes to himself 
and also to his neighbor. 
■09

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Moreover, if any of the teeth are 
unsound and painful the adjacent 
teeth are not likely to be used in the 
process of chewing, and the conse- 
quence is imperfect digestion. The 
remedy for these conditions is two- 
fold: personal cleanliness and other 
hygienic measures, and prompt treat- 
ment by a good dentist as soon as the 
first symptoms of decay appear. 

Structure of the Teeth. — The outer 
structure of the tooth consists of 
three parts: the root, which is con- 
tained in the bony substance of the 
jaw; the neck, which is contained in 
the gum, and the crown, which is the 
exposed portion. In the interior of 
each tooth is a cavity which contains 
the pulp, a pale-red soft substance 
composed of nerves and blood vessels. 
The surface of the root of the tooth 
is covered by a thin membrane called 
the periosteum, which, when the teeth 
decay, frequently becomes inflamed 
and is one of the causes of toothache. 

Infant's Teeth. — Fasten a bit of 
absorbent cotton on the point of an 
orange stick or a piece of soft pine 
wood. Dip it in a 5 per cent solu- 
tion of boric acid, and with this 
cleanse the milk teeth of children as 
soon as they appear. 

Or wind a piece of cotton around 
the finger and dip it in a 5 per cent 
solution of boric acid or a dilute so- 
lution of listerine. 

As soon as the full set of milk teeth, 
consisting of twenty teeth, or five on 
each half of each jaw, have all come 
in, a soft toothbrush should be used 
daily. Otherwise the milk, which 
forms such an important part of a 
child's diet, will be deposited between 
the teeth and become transformed into 
lactic acid. This tends to destroy the 
enamel and cause decay. 

Two important facts regarding chil- 
dren's teeth are often overlooked, and 
much mischief results. One is that 
the first permanent teeth usually ap- 
pear about the sixth or seventh year. 
The other is that several of the milk 
teeth are retained until about the 
twelfth year. This overlapping of the 
two sets of teeth makes early and con- 
stant care imperative. The first per- 
manent teeth must, of course, have at- 



tention if they are to be preserved, 
and the milk teeth that are retained 
must be kept in good order to insure 
proper digestion during the period of 
most rapid growth of the child. 

Teeth of Children. — One of the 
most common causes of trouble with 
the teeth in after life is the mistaken 
notion that children's teeth do not re- 
quire very much attention because 
they will soon be lost and replaced 
by others. Children, on the contrary, 
should be taught to clean their teeth 
at a very early age, partly because 
they will thus acquire a habit which 
it will afterwards be more diflBcult 
to teach them, but more especially be- 
cause the lack of proper development 
or decay of the milk teeth has a di- 
rect effect upon the health of the 
child, and an indirect effect upon the 
permanent teeth themselves. 

The appearance of the milk teeth 
about the seventh month is a signal 
that the child should commence to 
have solid food and should no longer 
be fed exclusively on milk and other 
soft foods. And during the entire 
period when the milk teeth are com- 
ing in, children should be encouraged 
to eat crackers and dry bread, and 
not allowed to discard the crusts. 
The resistance of coarse food in- 
creases the circulation of the blood 
and gives the necessary exercise to 
develop the gums and the jaw mus- 
cles that are necessary to proper 
chewing. All of this has a direct in- 
fluence in improving the quality of 
the permanent teeth. If the milk 
teeth show black spots or other evi- 
dence of decay, they should be at 
once treated, and filled, if necessary, 
with the same care as the ])ermanent 
teeth. If they are suffered to decay, 
the permanent teeth coming in their 
place will be likelv to decay also. 

Care of the Teeth.— There are two 
cardinal rules in the care of the 
teeth: keep them clean and consult a 
good dentist. Few professions have 
arrived at a degree of proficiency 
equal to that of modern dentistry. 
In fact, the public does not generally 
realize what dentistry can and ought 
to do. The notion is far too preva- 
lent that the business of a dentist is 



THE TEETH 



711 



to fill decayed teeth, or to pull them, 
and make false teeth, crowns, or 
bridges to take their place. A very 
important part of the duty of a mod- 
ern dentist is to prevent the teeth 
from decaying. Hence it is most un- 
wise to postpone visiting a dentist un- 
til one's teeth commence to ache. On 
the contrary, a dentist should be con- 
sulted at least twice a year and often- 
er if necessary, and children, espe- 
cially, should be taken to a dentist 
quite frequently during the period 
when the milk teeth are being lost and 
the permanent teeth are coming in. 

An honest dentist will make no ex- 
orbitant charges or attempt to do 
work that is unnecessary. On the 
other hand, by keeping the teeth clean, 
filling small cavities when they first 
appear, correcting any malformation 
of the teeth and giving advice as to 
suitable mouth washes and other 
treatment when abnormal conditions 
are present, a positive saving in fu- 
ture dentist's bills will be effected; 
toothache and the pain of pulling 
teeth and other dental work will be 
avoided, and the teeth themselves will 
be, as a rule, preserved intact with 
all of the attendant benefits. 

Tartar on the Teeth. — The accu- 
mulation of tartar in the form of a 
yellowish incrustation, which is usu- 
ally most plentiful on the inner side 
of the lower jaw, is almost universal. 
But the deposit is much more pro- 
nounced in some cases than in others. 
Tartar is not only objectionable in ap 
pearance, but also tends to push the 
gum away from the neck of the tooth, 
and thus expose the soft dentine be- 
tween the root and the harder enamel 
of the crown. In the course of years, 
the gum will recede so far as to allow 
the tooth to fall out, even if it is kept 
perfectly clean and is thus protected 
from decay. The accumulation of 
tartar cannot always be prevented by 
brushing the teeth, although the use of 
suitable tooth powders, pastes, or 
mouth washes will assist, but in all 
cases where the tartar is plentiful, the 
teeth should be thoroughly cleaned by 
a competent dentist three or four 
times a year, and an astringent lotion, 
as a 5 per cent solution of chloride of 



zinc or a solution of alum in soft wa- 
ter, should be rubbed on the gums 
daily. 

Aside from the advice and services 
of a dentist, the teeth should be thor- 
oughly brushed and cleaned at least 
once a day, or better still when pos- 
sible after each meal, and especially 
before retiring at niglit. And the 
teeth of small children should be 
cleaned for them before they are 
themselves old enough to form the 
habit of caring for them. 

Permanent Teeth are thirty-two in 
number, or eight on each half of each 
jaw. Two in the front center of the 
jaw are called inciiors or cutting 
teeth, and appear in the eighth or 
ninth year. One, next in order, the 
canine or dog tooth, appears between 
the eleventh and fifteenth year. Two 
next, called ■premolars, appear be- 
tween the tenth and fifteenth year. 
Three last in the back part of the 
mouth are called molars, of which the 
first (as has already been mentioned) 
appears about the seventh year, the 
second between the thirteenth and 
sixteenth year, and the third, which 
is called the " wisdom " tooth, be- 
tween the eighteenth and twenty- 
sixth year. 

Care of the Permanent Teeth. — 
Chewing dry toast, crackers, hard 
bread or other coarse food, greatly 
assists in keeping the permanent 




The Way the Brush is Handled: 



teeth in good condition. But for the 
purpose of dislodging particles of 
food, removing tartar and other sub- 
stances a good toothbrush is indis- 
pensable. A toothbrush having me- 
dium soft bristles is preferable to one 
having stiff bristles, which may tend 
to injure or inflame the gum. The 
shape of the brush is not particularly 
important, although the so-called 
" prophylactic " brush assists in dis- 
lodging food from the teeth in the 



712 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



back part of the mouth. What is 
more important is the manner in 
which the brush is handled. In 
addition to the sidewise strokes, 
the brush should also be worked up 
and down so as to remove from be- 
tween the teeth particles of food that 
would only be crowded in more tightly 
by rubbing back and forth. This is 
very important. Tlie inner surface of 
the teeth should be brushed in the 
same manner, care being taken to cov- 
er, in brushing, every portion of the 
teeth that can be reached. The 
strokes of the brush should also cover 
the adjacent gums. This may cause 
them to bleed slightly at first, but in 
time they will harden and become 
strengthened. By promoting the cir- 
culation of blood, this will greatly 
improve the nutrition of the teeth 
and insure their permanency. 

Toothpicks. — Etiquette forbids the 
use of the toothpick in public. But 
a supply of quills or wooden tooth- 
picks of good quality should always 
be kept at hand at the toilet table. 
These should be used as frequently 
as possible after meals to remove 
particles of food that cannot be dis- 
lodged by the use of the brush. 
When, as sometimes happens, the 
formation of the teeth is such that a 
toothpick cannot be used to advan- 
tage, a piece of silk thread, such as is 
used by dentists, can be procured at 
a drug store or dentist's oflBce. This 
will be found very useful for this 
purpose. After the use of the tooth- 
pick or thread, the mouth should be 
thoroughly rinsed, preferably with 
warm water, which has the property 
of dissolving foreign substances to a 
greater extent than cold water would 
do. And, if possible, a good antisep- 
tic mouth wash, such as peroxide of 
hydrogen, should be used. 

Or use a strong solution of table 
salt in warm water. 

Care of the Toothbrush. — After 
using a toothbrush, rinse it carefully, 
wipe it dry on a clean towel and hang 
it up where it will be exjiosed to sun- 
light and a draught of air. Never 
keep a toothbrush in a closed box or 
hang it up in a closet. Never lay 
down a wet toothbrush to dry, es- 



pecially on the back, as this allows 
the moisture to run along the bristles 
into the back of the brush, softens the 
glue with which they are fastened in, 
and causes them to decay and fall out. 
It is hardly necessary to say tliat no 
two persons should ever use' the same 
toothbrush. 

DENTIFRICES 

This is a general term including 
all tooth powders, ])astes, and washes 
for the teeth. The principal ingredi- 
ents of these preparations are various 
substances in powdered form that are 
capable of exerting a gentle friction 
on the teeth and also have antacid, ab- 
sorbent, or other useful properties, as 
chalk, Armenian bole, cuttlefish bone, 
charcoal, orris root, and Peruvian 
bark. To these may be added mild 
alkaUes, and other substances having 
cleansing properties, as borax, bicar- 
bonate of soda, and Castile soap; 
astringent substances as alum and 
tannic acid; and agreeable vehicles as 
15owdercd sugar, rock candy, honey, 
sirup, and sugar of milk. ' Any of 
these mixtures may be perfumed with 
a few drops of any of the essential 
oils or essences, or colored by the ad- 
dition of finely pulverized red coral, 
rose pink, cochineal, dragon's blood, 
or red Sanders for red; ocher for yel- 
low; indigo for blue or violet. Vari- 
ous other substances having specific 
properties too numerous to mention 
may be added. 

To Whiten the Teeth.— Salt com- 
bined with peroxide of hydrogen is a 
powerful bleach. Apply' by wetting 
the brush with the pure peroxide and 
sprinkle with dry salt, but do not use 
this oftener than is necessary. 

Tooth powders containing charcoal 
assist in whitening the teeth. A little 
dry charcoal powder may be rubbed 
gently into the crevices between the 
teeth on retiring at night, and brushed 
or rinsed out thoroughly in the 
morning. The use of bicarbonate of 
soda as a tooth powder has the same 
property. 

Mix 1 ounce of chloride of lime, 10 
ounces of prepared chalk, ^ ounce of 
Peruvian bark, 1 teaspoonful of tine- 



THE TEETH 



713 



ture of myrrh. Use once a day until 
the teeth are sufBciently whitened. 
Afterwards use an ordinary tooth 
powder. 

The juice of the common straw- 
berry is said to be a natural denti- 
frice which has the property of dis- 
solving tartar and sweetening the 
breath. 

Or, to remove tartar, dip the brush 
in powdered magnesia. 

Tooth Powder. — A good tooth 
powder is a very necessary toilet ar- 
ticle, as it not only increases the effi- 
ciency of the brush, but also makes 
the operation of cleansing the teeth 
more agreeable, and hence tends to 
strengthen the habit. 

Standard tooth powders are based 
mainly upon some carbonate having a 
slightly alkaline quality. But care 
must be taken not to use the stronger 
alkalies, as they tend to irritate the 
gums and mucuous surfaces of the 
mouth. Manj'^ of the tooth powders 
of commerce, especially the cheaper 
sorts, contain substances that if used 
with hard water produce free alkali. 
This may have a very injurious effect 
upon the gums. Hence it is much 
better to buy the ingredients and 
make up a tooth powder for yourself, 
or have a recipe made up for you by 
a local druggist. Thus you will know 
exactly what ingredients it contains. 
The powders used in tooth powders 
must be very finely pulverized and 
free from gritty particles. Such sub- 
stances as ground oyster shells, pum- 
ice, cuttlefish bone, cigar ashes, and 
the like, unless ground very fine in- 
deed, are unnecessarily coarse and 
gritty. Tooth powders may be col- 
ored at will, as the coloring matter 
does not affect their efficiency one 
way or the other. The addition of 
some agreeable perfume, as the oil of 
wintergreen, sassafras, or the like, 
may have a decided advantage in mak- 
ing children and others take more 
kindly to the frequent use of tooth 
powder. A word of caution is espe- 
cially needed against the use of com- 
mercial tooth powders that rapidly re- 
move tartar and quickly give the teeth 
a snowy whiteness. To accomplish 
these results they contain strong acids 



that will injure the enamel and make 
the last state of the teeth much worse 
than the first. 

To Compound Tooth Powders. — If 
charcoal or cuttlefish bone are used, 
they should be reduced to a very fine 
powder in a mortar, and may be im- 
proved by mixing with water and al- 
lowing tlie coarser and heavier par- 
ticles to settle. The finer particles 
that settle more slowly may then be 
poured off without disturbing the sed- 
iment. The water may then be per- 
mitted to evaporate, thus leaving a 
resulting powder of the best qual- 
ity. 

Or, after the ingredients have been 
rubbed up together in the mortar as 
finely as possible, the whole may be 
rubbed through a very fine gauze sieve 
to remove the coarser particles. As 
tooth powders contain absorbent sub- 
stances, they should be kept in tightly 
closed wide-mouthed bottles when 
not in use. 

Tooth Pastes. — Any of the ordi- 
nary tooth powders may be put up in 
the form of pastes by reducing them 
to a very fine powder and mixing 
them with a little clarified honey or 
almond cream or simple sirup to a 
moderately stiff paste. Sufficient es- 
sential oils or alcohol to act as a pre- 
servative should be added, otherwise 
they are likely to ferment or effer- 
vesce. 

Or the ingredients may be mixed 
with cologne or lavender water or 
other perfumed toilet water to the 
desired consistency. They should be 
tightly covered to exclude the air. 

To compound tooth pastes, first 
rub up the dry materials to a very 
fine powder in a mortar, moisten 
slightly with alcohol or perfumed 
toilet water, and add slowly enough 
honey or sirup to form a paste of the 
right consistency, beating all the time 
with an egg beater or otherwise to 
thoroughly incorporate the materials. 
Or mix the mass on a piece of glass or 
marble or other smooth hard surface. 
Let stand twenty-four hours before 
sealing. 

Mouth Washes. — The use of an 
antiseptic and scented mouth wash is 
very agreeable and is to be recom-

odor, and should contain nothing in- 
jurious to the general health. 

Mouth washes are used with sev- 
eral objects in view, and the ingredi- 
ents recommended vary accordingly. 
Among these may be mentioned hard- 
ening and strengthening the gums, 
cleansing the teeth, neutralizing the 
effects of acids and bacteria pres- 
ent in decayed teeth or parti- 
cles of food, and sweetening and 
purifying the breath. Substances 
recommended for these various pur- 



of tartar, and borax, and perfumed 
substances, as the various essences 
and toilet waters. 

These preparations are simple mix- 
tures. Hence it is only necessary to 
give the various recipes in the table 
given elsewhere. 

Peroxide of Hydrogen. — Peroxide 
of hydrogen is perhaps the most gen- 
erally efficient and satisfactory all- 
around mouth wash that can be used. 
If the peroxide is too active in its 
effects and causes the sensation de-

scribed by athletes as " spitting cot- 
ton," it may be followed by a solu- 
tion of baking soda in water, which 
will neutralize its eflFects. This is a 
chemical substance consisting of di- 
oxide of hydrogen diluted with wa- 
ter. It is a limpid, colorless liquid 
having a slightly acid taste. It is sim- 
ilar in composition to water charged 
with oxj'gen, which is readily set free 
when in contact with any substance 
for which it has an affinity. Thus 
when applied to the mucous mem- 
brane, oxygen is set free, which ac- 
tively attacks any foreign organic 
matter that may be present. It is 
used as a deodorant and an antisep- 
tic in medicine for the treatment of 
sores, sore throat, and diphtheria, and 
as a mouth wash for bleaching the 
teeth and cleansing the gums and 
other mucous surfaces. It is at once 
the safest and most active substance 
known in medical science for these 
purposes, and its general use is to be 
highly recommended. 

THE BEEATH 

Foul breath is most often caused by 
decayed teeth, inflammation of the 
gums, or neglect to use the toothbrush. 
It may also be caused by catarrh 
or various diseases of the throat and 
stomach or other internal organs. 

Substtmces recommended for puri- 
fying the breath are essence of cam- 
phor, chloride of lime, tincture of 
myrrh, chloride of soda, chloride of 
potash, carbolic acid, and various sub- 
stances designed to heal and 
strengthen diseased gums. In addi- 
tion, various perfumes are made up 
into pastilles to perfume the breath, 
but these are rarely effective in over- 
coming foul breath, are in themselves 
offensive to many, and their use may 
be obviated by suitable means to re- 
move the cause. 

One of the most effective remedies 
for foul breath is a mouth wash com- 
posed of a teaspoonful of concen- 
trated solution of chloride of soda in 
a tumbler of water. This should be 
used as a gargle and also forced 
back and forth between the teeth. Or, 
if foul breath is caused by stomach 



troubles, take 8 drops of the solu- 
tion of chloride of soda in half a 
tumbler of soft water before break- 
fast. 

Or use any good mouth wash con- 
taining chloride of potash, tannin or 
tannic acid, myrrh or Peruvian bark. 
All of these are good for the gums 
and tend to prevent foul breath and 
like conditions. 

Or chlorine water obtained from a 
druggist and employed as a wash or 
gargle is helpful. Use a tablespoon- 
ful to half a tumbler of water. 

Or use a tooth powder containing 
charcoal and one of the mouth washes 
mentioned above. If these are not 
efficacious, there is probably some or- 
ganic disease, and a physician should 
be consulted. 

Loose teeth or looseness of the teeth 
may be due to the effects of tartar, 
to diseases of the gum, old age, or 
other causes. Use as a remedy an 
astringent mouth wash of a teaspoon- 
ful of alum dissolved in a quart of 
soft water or any mouth wash con- 
taining myrrh, tannic acid, and simi- 
lar substances. 

To Remove the Odor of Onions. — 
A cup of black coffee tends to re- 
move the odor of onions from the 
breath. 

Or parsley with vinegar is useful 
for this purpose. 

Or 4 or 5 drops of the concentrated 
solution of chloride of soda taken in 
2 teaspoonfuls of cold water. 

TOOTHACHE 

This may arise from several causes. 
Either the crown or root of the tooth 
may partly or wholly decay, the gum 
may recede so as to expose the soft 
dentine of the neck of the tooth, or 
the membrane covering the outer sur- 
face of the root of the tooth may be 
inflamed. All of the conditions that 
give rise to toothache are a serious 
menace to the general health, and 
should have the early attention of a 
competent dentist. Toothache is a 
warning that these conditions are 
present, and if attended to in time 
will certainly be a means of avoid- 
ing graver consequences. When the 



THE TEETH 



717 



enamel of the tooth becomes broken, 
the bone decays in all directions un- 
til the pulp or nerve of the tooth be- 
comes affected. Often a very small 
orifice in the enamel, which is hardly 
noticeable, may lead to the decay of 
the whole interior of the tooth. And 
this condition may not be suspected 
until the crown happens to be chipped 
or broken. Hence, if the teeth are 
sensitive to cold or to the touch, or if 
they ache or " grumble " more or less 
from time to time, a dentist should be 
immediately consulted, so that the 
cavity may be filled before the nerve 
is affected. Otherwise the roots of 
the nerve may decay and produce 
ulcers, which will work their way 
through the bones of the jaw and the 
gums and discharge into the mouth. 
During these conditions the process 
of chewing is much affected, tartar 
accumulates on the teeth, and general 
bad conditions prevail. 

Hence the use of toothache reme- 
dies is only advisable when for any 
reason it is not possible to consult a 
dentist. And the fact that they al- 
lay the pain, and thus seem to effect 
a temporary cure, should not be al- 
lowed to cause the sufferer to lose 
sight of the danger signal that means 
trouble ahead unless the cause of the 
pain is permanently removed. 

Treatment of Toothache. — This de- 
pends upon the cause. And the only 
permanent cure is the removal of the 
cause, if possible, by the aid of a good 
dentist. 

Toothache caused by cavities which 
expose the dentine, but do not affect 
the nerve, is usually due to local irri- 
tations caused by acids, sweets, or 
salt taken into the mouth, by the 
presence of acid in the saliva due to 
indigestion, by the use of the tooth- 
brush, or by exposure to cold. In 
such cases a dentist should be con- 
sulted and the tooth filled as soon as 
possible. Filling the cavities will al- 
most always give immetliate relief. 
If the neck of the tooth is exposed, 
mouth washes should be used contain- 
ing such substances as bicarbonate of 
soda, carbonate of magnesia, and 
other alkalies, to neutralize the acid 
that may be present in the saliva, and 



suitable washes should be used to 
strengthen the guuis. 

Among substances recommended to 
give temporary relief in toothache are 
counterirritants, such as oil of cloves 
or cinnamon, alum, carbolic acid, am- 
monia; and various anaesthetics, as 
opium, belladonna, ether, sulphate of 
morphia, chloral hydrate, laudanum, 
and the like. Many of these are pow- 
erful and dangerous drugs and should 
be used only with the most intelligent 
caution. They should never be used 
when it is possible to consult a dentist, 
and they must not be expected to ef- 
fect a permanent cure. 

First cleanse the cavity, if possible, 
with a bit of cotton on the point of 
a toothpick dipped in peroxide of 
hydrogen or a solution of baking 
soda in warm water, or a solution of 
boric acid, listerine, or other antisep- 
tic. Rinse out the cavity with the 
same solution by means of a medicine 
dropper or small syringe, or by using 
it as a mouth wash. 

Use the oil of cloves or equal parts 
of the oil of cloves and chlorofonm. 
Saturate a bit of cotton with this 
and crowd into the cavity. Renew 
frequently. But if the tooth is ul- 
cerated, saturate the cotton and place 
it on the gum. 

Another effective pain-killer is to 
paint the gum with tincture of iodine. 
Take care, however, not to swallow 
this as it is poisonous. 

In addition to the above, tooth- 
ache will usually be relieved by ap- 
plying to the face any poultice hav- 
ing the property of retaining heat, or 
resting the face on a hot-water bot- 
tle, soapstone, or common red brick 
covered with flannel. 

Dental Work. — Teeth should never 
be pulled unless it is absolutely nec- 
essary. And this will not often be 
the case if the warning given by sen- 
sitiveness of the tooth, or by tooth- 
ache, is heeded in season. The loss of 
the tooth usually renders the corre- 
sponding tooth on the opposite jaw 
useless for chewing. It also impairs 
proper pronunciation in speech. 

Always consult the best dentists 
available and do not put too much 
confidence in the men who advertise

cheap or painless dentistry- When 
the pulp or nerve of the tooth is af- 
fected it should be deadened and 
completely removed, and the root 
canal should be thoroughly cleaned 
out. This cannot be done properly 
without some pain. And if the op- 
eration is painless there is ground for 
suspicion that it may not have been 
thorough. Once the cavity and roots 
have been thoroughly cleaned and 
filled by a competent dentist, all trou- 
ble with that tooth will be at an end. 
The judgment of a dentist should be 
taken as to what sort of filling should 
be employed in any tooth. But all 
cavities should be filled promptly and 
properly, otherwise stomach troubles 
are sure to follow. 



Artificial Teeth. — The progress of 
modern dentistry is nowhere more ap- 
parent than in the cheapness and per- 
fection with which lost teeth can be 
replaced. Sometimes when the crown 
of the tooth is broken, it can be cov- 
ered with an artificial crown, and the 
loss of one or more teeth can some- 
times be repaired by a bridge con- 
sisting of several crowns anchored to 
two or three adjacent roots. All lost 
teeth, whether in the front or back 
part of the mouth, should be, on the 
ground of health, replaced at the ear- 
liest possible moment. Artificial 
teeth should be kept perfectly clean. 
And plates should be removed at 
night and placed in an antiseptic so- 
lution, such as listerine or boric acid.

The custom of this country has 
established Monday as wash day. 
Many families, however, prefer Tues- 
day, in order to have an opportunity 
on Monday to sort over the different 
articles, mend tears, remove stains, 
and the like. 

Bed clothing is usually changed on 
Saturday, and body clothing on Sat- 
urday or Sunday, so that all clothes 
may be readily collected and at hand 
early Monday morning. 

Laundry Bags. — Each person in 
the family should have a laundry bag 
in his or her own room in which 
soiled garments may be kept in prep- 
aration for the weekly wash. A sep- 
arate laundry bag for soiled table 
linen and napkins should be hung on 
the back of the pantry door or some 
other clean dry place where mice can- 
not get at it. If these articles are not 
kept out of the way they will scent 
the spots of grease in table linen and 
gnaw their way to them. 

Laundry bags may be made of 
heavy unbleached muslin, or worn-out 
pillowcases may be used by facing 
them to hold a draw string. 

Ordinary crash toweling, folded 
across and sewed at the sides, makes 
a convenient laundry bag. 

Or ornamental bags may be made 
in the form of a double pocket, hav- 



719 



ing one opening across the middle with 
two bag-like receptacles. 

Clothes Hamper. — In addition to 
these laundry bags a clothes hamper, 
located conveniently near the laundry, 
will be found very handy to receive 
soiled towels and bed linen. Covered 
basket hampers may be obtained at 
the stores. 

Or a cheap clothes hamper may be 
made from a small barrel, by lining 
it inside with cambric or calico and 
covering the outside with cretonne or 
other material arranged in plaits. 
The lid may be covered with the same 
material and supplied with a covered 
knob in the center. The lining should 
be sewed together in breadths like a 
skirt. 

Or a hamper may be made of a 
dry-goods box by lining and covering 
it in the same manner with any suit- 
able material. By padding the top 
this box may be used as a seat and 
may be placed where a barrel would 
be inconvenient. 

Sorting the Laundry. — Spread a 
white sheet on the floor and empty on 
this the contents of the laundry 
bags and hamper. Sort the small and 
delicate pieces of fine linen, as laces, 
fine waists, aprons, and petticoats, in 
one pile. It is a good plan to have 
one or two wash bags of cotton, 



720 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



about two feet square, in which to 
place these pieces to soak and boil 
them. Or they can be boiled sep- 
arately in a kettle or small boiler. 

Put the table linen, linen towels, 
and doOics in one pile; the bed and 
body linen, kitchen towels, and bath 
towels in another; the colored clothes, 
hosiery, and coarser articles in a 
third; and the flannels and woolens 
by themselves. These lots should be 
kept separate throughout the wash- 
ing, the fine linen and table linen go- 
ing into the first tub and the first 
boiler; bed and body linen into the 
second tub and second boiler; colored 
clothes being washed separately, but 
not boiled; and flannels being re- 
served for separate treatment. By 
this plan the same suds maj"^ be used 
in the boiler if desired, although 
changing the water is much to be pre- 
ferred. 

laundry — To Remove Stains. — 
While sorting the clothes, they should 
be carefully looked over for stains 
from fruit, grass, acids, pencil marks, 
ink, etc., as these may be much more 
readily eradicated before they are 
touclied by soap or boiling water. 
Pencil marks especially should be 
erased carefulty with a rubber eraser, 
as the hot water will make them in- 
delible. 

SOAP AND SOAP MAKING 

Properties of Soap. — Garments of 
linen and other fabrics become soiled 
principally by the oily exudations of 
the body, as in perspiration and the 
natural ' oil of the hair, and in the 
case of table linen, by animal fats, 
etc. The skin itself, of course, re- 
tains a considerable part of the oily 
substances not absorbed by the cloth- 
ing. These greasy substances by 
their adhesive quality attract and 
hold particles of dirt. When soap is 
dissolved in water, the neutral alkali 
salts become in part separated into 
alkali which dissolves, and free fatty 
acid which precipitates. This ex- 
plains why the transparency of clear 
water is disturbed by the use of soap 
even of the purest kind. 

The detergent or cleansing proper- 
ties of soap are due to the presence of 



free alkali, either caustic potash or 
soda liberated in the soapsuds. This 
attacks and decomposes the grease 
contained in soiled linen, in perspira- 
tion, and in dishwater, unites with the 
fatty acids, and in turn saponifies 
them. The process is precisely sim- 
ilar to that of soap-making. The 
union of the alkali set free in soap- 
suds with the grease of garments or 
dishwater produces a soapy substance 
which is readily soluble, and hence is 
easily removed bj' rinsing. 

Free Alkali. — Since the cleansing 
properties of soap are due to the 
presence of free alkali, it may be 
asked whj' the alkalies themselves — 
as potash lye or sal soda cannot be 
used without the trouble of uniting 
them with animal fats by soap mak- 
ing. It is true that lye and other 
strong alkalies have strong detergent 
properties. They attack, however, 
not only the grease by also the fab- 
rics themselves and rot or weaken 
them, and also irritate the skin. 
Hence the object of soap-making is 
to form a compound which will re- 
lea^e a small, definite quantity of al- 
kali at the moment that it is required. 

Soap Test. — Alkali has a strong, 
biting taste. Hence the best test of 
soap is to apply the tongue to it. If 
it bites, the soap contains an excess 
of free alkali and is not suitable for 
the toilet or laundry. If it does not, 
it is good soap and will probably not 
injure the most delicate fabrics. 

Importance of Soap. — Whether or 
not cleanliness is next to godliness, 
historians say that the degree of civ- 
ilization of a nation is indicated by 
the quantity of soap it consumes. 
The kind and quality of soap and 
other cleansing articles used by a 
household is a good indication of the 
refinement of the family. There 
should be no economy in the use of 
soap, but since, if very freely used, 
it becomes quite an im]iortant item 
of expense, a considerable saving 
may be made by the use of home- 
made soap and other cleeinsing com- 
poimds. 

The domestic art of soap-making 
also has an educationrii value. Soap 
is a chemical compound, and we per- 
form a real chemical experiment 



THE HOME LAUNDRY 



721 



every time we wash our hands or 
wash clothing in the laundry. Soap 
was made as early as the second cen- 
tury of the Christian era, before the 
modern science of chemistry was in- 
augurated, and good soap may be 
made by observing the following in- 
structions without troubling oneself 
to understand the chemical principles 
involved. On the other hand, it is 
interesting, as a matter of general in- 
formation, to understand the chemis- 
try of soap-making. 

There is a group of substances hav- 
ing similar properties, which is known 
in chemistry as alkalies, and another 
group, having very different proper- 
ties, which is known as acids. These 
two kinds of substances have a 
strong attraction or affinity for each 
other, and when brought together un- 
der suitable conditions they unite to 
form another class of substances, the 
compounds known as salts. Common 
salt is a good example; it consists of 
an alkali, sodium, and an acid, chlorine. 
Most of the salts are freely soluble 
in water. 

Soaps are alkali salts of fatty acids. 
The alkalies commonly used in mak- 
ing soaps are soda and potash. All 
of the animal fats, and also the ani- 
mal and vegetable oils, contain fatty 
acids. When the proper alkalies are 
brought into contact with the animal 
fats or oils, under proper conditions, 
the alkahes attack the globules of fat 
or oil and unite with the fatty acids to 
form alkali salts of fatty acids — i. e., 
soap. This process is known as sa- 
ponification. 

To make soap it is customary to dis- 
solve an alkali, either potash or soda, 
in water, forming a liquid known as 
lye; to dilute the lye; then mix with 
it a suitable quantity of fat or oil, 
and to stir until saponification takes 
place. If the mixture is cold, the pro- 
cess may require several days or even 
months, depending upon the strength 
and purity of the ingredients. But if 
the mixture is raised to 212° F. by 
boiling, the process of saponification 
may take place in a few minutes or 
hours. Hence there are two processes 
of soap-making — in the cold and by 
boiling. 

The cold process, generally speak- 



ing, produces what is known as a soft 
soap. This is not true or pure soap, 
but contains, in addition to the actual 
dry alkali salts of the fatty acids — 
i. e., real soap — certain other ingredi- 
ents, as water, glycerin (which is con- 
tained in all natural fats and is lib- 
erated in the process of soap-mak- 
ing), more or less free alkali, and 
other impurities. In other words, soft 
soap is only partial saponified. The 
pure or hard soap, completing the 
process of saponification, is obtained 
by boiling soft soap until the glycerin 
and other impurities are absorbed by 
the hot lye, and by the addition of 
salt to remove the surplus of water. 
The salt, having a stronger affinity for 
water than the soap has, causes the 
water and the impurities it holds in 
solution to sink into the oil. The pure 
hard soap rises to the surface and 
forms a cake which may be removed. 
The lye, containing glycerin and 
other impurities, can then be dis- 
carded. 

A better quality of soap may be 
obtained by melting the product of the 
first boiling a second time, and by 
adding more clean, strong lye and 
clear, melted grease or oil, and stir- 
ring over the fire until complete 
saponification takes place. 

THE lAUNDRY 

Utensils for Washing. — The list of 
utensils for the laundry includes wash 
boiler, wringer, washboard, washing 
machine, three or four tubs, two or 
three pails, clothes stick, dipper, and 
large and small clothes baskets. 
Wooden tubs and pails are the most 
common, but those made of paper or 
wood pulp are to be preferred, as 
they are lighter and will not fall to 
pieces if allowed to dry. 

The Boiler. — The ordinary tin boil- 
ers are commonly used, but a copper 
or steel boiler enameled white on the 
inside and painted some suitable color 
outside is the best. Tubs and boilers 
should be fitted with faucets to avoid 
lifting and the liability of accident 
in carrying hot suds from place to 
place. With good care a wash boiler 
should last a lifetime. Hence it is 
advisable to buy the best. 



722 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



The Wringer. — The principal cost 
of a wringer is in the rubber rollers, 
and it is true economy to buy an ar- 
ticle that has rolls made of pure rub- 
ber, and that may cost $5 or $(i, 
rather than a cheap article having 
rollers made of a composition that 
will last but a short time. When the 
rollers begin to wear, wrap them 
round with straps of strong, un- 
bleached cotton cloth. This will 
lengthen their usefulness many 
years. 

Washing Machine. — We especially 
recommend the purchase of a good 
washing machine. Like the sewing 
machine, this instrument has a very 
important bearing upon the welfare 
of the family by lessening the physical 
labor devolving upon the wife and 
mother, and thus saving much of her 
energy for the higher and more ele- 
vating duties of the household. We 
believe that any of the standard makes 
of washing machines are to be recom- 
mended in preference to the ordinary 
washboard, which is only a relic of 
barbarism. But we especially recom- 
mend the make which contains an in- 
ner cylinder in which the clothes are 
placed, and which is revolved in an 
outer cylinder containing water. This 
method tends to cleanse the clothes 
evenly and with the least possible 
wear. Other makes accomplish the re- 
sult by holding the clothes stationary, 
agitating the water, and squeezing the 
goods, very much after the fashion of 
the old-style clothes pounder; and 
still others revolve the garments in 
the tub bj' means of prongs, reversing 
the motion from time to time. The 
last method is perhaps the least satis- 
factory. When the clothes are sud- 
denly stopped and sent backward by 
the reverse motion they are subjected 
to a considerable strain. But even 
this method wears out the garments 
far less than does ruljbing on the 
washboard, and we strongly recom- 
mend some washing machine to every 
household. If the clothes are first 
boiled with soap and kerosene, or 
other good washing fluid, they can be 
run through the washer in about five 
minutes. Colored clothes cannot, of 
course, be boiled, and will require a 
longer time to wash. 



NATURE OF THE PROCESS 

Objects of Washing. — Dirt has 
been described as " matter which is out 
of place." The substances which soil 
garments and household linen are un- 
objectionable in their proper places, 
but become dirt when transferred to 
wearing apparel and linen, and re- 
quire to be removed by washing. 
These substances are principally of 
three classes: fruit, acids, ink, and 
other things which produce stains; 
animal oils, grease, or fats from the 
oily exudations from the body in pers- 
piration; or, in the case of table linen, 
from foods or from other sources; 
and particles of earth and other solids, 
either mixed with grease or caught 
in the texture of the fabric. Stains 
require siJecial treatment according to 
the nature of the substance which pro- 
duces them; greasy substances, as oils 
or fats require to be decomposed by 
the use of an alkali, in soaps or other- 
wise; and particles of earth and other 
substances, when set free from the 
grease in which they are usually im- 
bedded, may be removed by the me- 
chanical operations of rubbing and 
rinsing. Aside from stains, the most 
difficult part of washing is the de- 
composition, without injury to the fab- 
rics, of greasy substances by the ac- 
tion of an alkali. Unless this point 
is clearly imderstood, good results in 
washing will come rather from good 
luck than from good management. 

The means employed to remove dirt 
on fabrics are soaking, boiling, rub- 
bing, and rinsing, with the use of an 
alkali either in soaps or in the various 
preparations known as washing pow- 
ders and washing fluids. 

Soaking. — The object of soaking 
garments is to soften the dirt and 
loosen it by swelling the fabric. 
There is no objection to soaking the 
clothes in pure soft water for a rea- 
sonable time, but soaking them over 
night in water with soap and wash- 
ing fluids or powders is not advisable. 
The first effect of the alkali con- 
tained in soap is to soften the greasy 
substances which cause dirt to ad- 
here to the fabric, and to render 
them soluble in water. But if these 
substances are not immediately re- 



THE HOME LAUNDRY

moved by washing and rinsing, an- 
otlier chemical action takes place 
which produces compounds that, 
while not always visible to the 
eye, are very much more difficult to 
remove. This is especially likely to 
be the case if soap or other deter- 
gents are used which contain much 
alkali. The result is often to give 
the clothes a heavy or musty smell 
and a dingy appearance after iron- 
ing. Instead, try soaking the gar- 
ments for about twenty minutes in 
boiling water containing borax. 

Or rub soiled articles with a piece 
of wet soap on the morning of wash 
day and soak in cold water for about 
two hours before washing. 

If clothes are soaked over night 
use pure soft water only, without any 
soap or other washing compounds. If 
not, put the clothes to soak in cold soft 
water the very first thing in the morn- 
ing while the wash water is heating and 
breakfast is being prepared, first rub- 
bing soiled articles, especially the 
greasy spots, with a piece of wet 
soap before putting them in the water. 

Eubbing^. — Rubbing is, of course, 
merely a mechanical operation, but 
it assists the action of soap and wash- 
ing compounds by removing the 
greasy substances that have been de- 
composed by the alkali and by bring- 
ing what remains into contact with 
the alkaline suds. 

Right here note a helpful labor- 
saving device. Instead of rubbing 
the clothes in the usual way lay the 
washboard across the top of the tub 
and apply soap to them with a scrub- 
bing brush having rather stiff bristles. 
Use the brush especially for the neck, 
wristbands, and other spots which are 
especially soiled or greasy. This 
cleanses them much more quickly than 
rubbing in the usual manner, besides 
being easier for the laundress and 
much less detrimental to the garment. 
This method is especially helpful for 
men's overalls, heavy blankets, and 
other coarse articles that are difficult 
to clean. Put the clothes through a 
wringer into the second tub and wash 
again, looking them over carefully for 
dirty spots. 

Boiling'. — Boiling is also a mechan- 
ical process, as the steam passing 



through the garments agitates them 
and loosens the particles of dirt con- 
tained in their texture. Boiling water 
and steam also increase the activity 
of the alkali in attacking and decom- 
posing the grease. 

Hinsing. — Rinsing is a mechanical 
operation for removing the excess of 
soap, with the dirt, glycerin, and 
other impurities that have been re- 
leased by the action of the washing 
compounds. 

These processes should be firmly 
fixed in mind, and the nature and 
properties of soap and other cleansing 
compounds should be fully understood 
by all who wish to obtain satisfactory 
results in washing. 

The principal object of rinsing 
clothes is to remove the excess of 
soap. Hence they must be thor- 
oughly rinsed until all the suds dis- 
appear from the water. If plenty 
of hot water can be had it should be 
used for the first rinsing, as the soap 
contained in the garment will dissolve 
in hot water much more readily than 
in cold. It is customary, however, to 
lift the clothes from the boiler directly 
into a tub of cold rinsing water, rinse 
thoroughly, wring out into a second 
rinsing water, and continue rinsing 
until all trace of soap disappears. If 
any soap is left in the garments it will 
unite with the bluing and make the 
clothes yellow. After the final rinsing 
and bluing the articles must be wrung 
out, rolled in bundles, and sorted, 
starched pieces being placed in one 
basket and unstarched ones in another, 
and hung up to dry at once. It is a 
good idea to first spread a large, clean 
cloth in the bottom of the basket. 

Plan for Wash Day.— The follow- 
ing routine is especially recommended : 
get up at daylight and get the wash- 
ing out of the way as early as possible. 
It is surprising how much can be ac- 
complished early in the morning be- 
fore the regular routine of the day 
begins. 

First Boiling. — Next fill the boiler 
with clear soft water, or if the water 
is hard, add borax to soften it. Put 
it on the stove and bring to a boil. 
Rinse out the tubs with hot water 
and soap to remove any dust that 
may have accumulated. When the 



724 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



clothes have been well soaked, run 
them through a wringer or wring 
them out hghtly by hand, put them in 
tubs half filled witn hot water from the 
boiler, and rub on the washboard, using 
plenty of soap. Or use the washing 
machine. 

Second Boiling. — Run them again 
through the wringer and put them in 
a boiler with cold water over the fire. 
The articles may be rubbed separately 
with soap as they come from the 
wringer before being placed in the 
boiler, or shaved hard soap or other 
washing compounds may be dissolved 
in the water in which lie clothes are 
boiled. If washing fluids or powders 
are used, care must be taken to dis- 
solve them in the water before the 
clothes are put in, as otherwise they 
may settle in the folds of the fabrics 
and eat holes in them with the excess 
of alkali they contain. Let the clothes 
come to a boil, pressing them down 
occasionally with a clothes stick. The 
first boiler should contain the first 
sorting of fine linen, and while these 
are coming to a boil the second sort- 
ing may be in the process of rubbing. 
Tlie boiler should be emptied and re- 
filled with cold water every time a 
new lot is put in. Clothes should be 
lifted from the boiler with a clothes 
stick, held up to drain slightly, and 
placed in a tubful of clear, cold rins- 
ing water. 

WATER FOR THE LAUNDRY 

Laundry Water Supply. — All water 
for laundry purposes must be soft or 
else the clothes cannot be made clean. 
Hard water that contains lime and 
other mineral substances, or that is 
brackish from its vicinity to the sea, 
will cause the soap to curdle and 
float on its surface. In limestone 
regions and other localities where the 
water is hard, perhaps the best method 
is to collect rain water in a cistern or 
rain-water barrel, but hard water can 
be softened in various ways for laun- 
drv purposes. 

To Test Water. — To find out 
whether or not water is fit for laundry 
purposes, dissolve a little good white 
soap in alcohol and put a few drops of 
this solution into a glassful of water. 



If the water is pure the soap solution 
will be dissolved and the water will 
continue limpid, but if it is impure the 
soap will form into white flakes which 
will tend to float on the surface. 

To Soften Hard Water. — Bring the 
water to a boil and expose it to the 
air, which maj' be done by pouring it 
from some little height into a tub or 
other vessel, and afterwards letting 
it stand over night. 

Or boil it with the addition of a 
little baking soda, and afterwards ex- 
pose it to the air. 

Or place a quantity of clean wood 
ashes in a tightly closed woolen bag 
and immerse the bag in a tub of 
water. The required amount of ashes 
can be ascertained by experiment. 

Or use chalk, which may be put 
into the spring or well or used in a tub 
or bucket, the proper amount depend- 
ing upon the extent of the impurities, 
and to be determined in each locality 
by experiment. 

' Rain-water Barrel. — A cask to hold 
rain water should be provided with a 
hinged lid or other cover to prevent 
dust and dirt from getting in, and to 
keep out insects that would use it as 
a breeding place. It should be raised 
above the ground by stone or brick, 
and be furnished with a spigot to 
draw oif the water for use. 

LABOR-SAVING METHODS, WASH- 
ING FLUIDS, ETC. 

Certain compounds added to the 
water in which the clothes are boiled 
are recommended as labor savers. 
Washing fluids and powders contain 
two kinds of ingredients: volatile sub- 
stances, such as kerosene, tui-pentine, 
alcohol, ammonia, and camphor gum; 
and alkaline substances, as potash and 
soda lyes from wood ashes, sal soda, 
and various brands of commercial lye. 
These powerful chemicals must be used 
with the most intelligent caution. 

First Caution. — If the hands and 
arms are immersed in hot water con- 
taining turpentine, alcohol, ammonia, 
camphor, and similar substances, these 
are absorbed through the pores of the 
.skin and may seriously imperil the 
health. Paralysis is said sojuetimes to 
result from this cause. Hence it is 



THE HOME LAUNDRY 



725 



"best to use these compounds only in 
the boiler, and to take the garments 
out of the first rinsing water with the 
clothes stick, especially if hot water 
is used, rather than to immerse the 
arms therein. 

When turpentine has been used in 
the boiling water the clothes must be 
very thoroughly rinsed, as if any of 
it remains in garments worn next the 
skin it may cause mischief. 

Second Caution. — Substances that 
are strong in alkali, as potash and 
soda lyes and the like, are powerful 
cleansers, but clothes should not be 
allowed to lie in water that contains 
them for any length of time. If they 
are used in the boiling water the 
clothes must be boiled for a limited 
time and immediately removed and 
rinsed thoroughly. The alkali, as has 
already been explained, continues its 
action after decomposing greasy sub- 
stances and attacks the fabrics them- 
selves. It is injurious to the skin if 
not thoroughly rinsed from under- 
wear. 

Third Caution. — All washing pow- 
ders should be thoroughly dissolved 
in the boiling water before the gar- 
ments are added, so that the aikali 
and other ingredients may be present 
in equal strength in all parts of the 
water. If these compounds are added 
after the clothes have been put in 
they may settle in spots in the folds 
of the garments and eat into the fab- 
ric. 

Washing Fluids. — Most washing 
fluids amount to neither more nor less 
than potash or soda lye. In other 
words, they are liquids containing an 
excess of free alkali. Their use is 
quite customary on the ground that 
they do the work quickly and well 
and save labor, but they are open to 
the objection that unless used with 
great caution they tend to rot the 
clothes and to roughen and chap the 
hands and arms of the laimdress. 
They are, at best, only suitable for 
the coarser articles, and it is probable 
that their constant use weakens any- 
thing which they are employed to 
clean. 

Caustic Soda lye. — A common fam- 
ily recipe for washing fluid is caustic 
soda lye. Dissolve 1 pound of sal 



soda in 1 gallon of boiling water. 
Slake separately 8 ounces of fresh 
quicklime in '2 quarts of water. 
Bring tlie soda solution to a boil, pour 
in the slaked lime in a thin stream, 
stirring constantly, and let the mix- 
ture stand over night. Pour off the 
clear lye, taking care not to disturb the 
sediment, and preserve in glass bottles 
or stone jugs. "When this fiuid is 
used it is customary to soak the 
clothes over night in clear water, 
wring them out, and soap the soiled 
places. The boiler is then half filled 
with water which is brought to a boil 
and 1 teacupful of this fluid is stirred 
in thoroughly, after which the clothes 
are added and boiled for half an hour, 
when they can be cleaned with very 
little rubbing. The injury that the 
lye may do the fabric is not likely to 
be noticed as a result of a single 
washing, and the gradual weakening 
of the garment is likely to be attrib- 
uted to ordinary wear. Hence it is 
often asserted that this and other 
washing fluids can be used without 
rotting ordinary fabrics. But the in- 
jury, though slight, is certain. At aU 
events, if such fluids are used the 
greatest care must be taken not to let 
garments lie long in the suds, to rinse 
them very thoroughly in two or three 
waters and hang them out as quickly 
as possible. This washing fluid may 
be used in hot water for scrubbing 
floors, removing grease spots, and 
cleansing greasy pots, kettles and the 
like. But care must be taken not to 
use it on tinware or aluminum or 
strong enough to injure the hands. 

Caustic Potash Lye. — The basis of 
another class of washing fluids fre- 
quently recommended is potash lye, 
which is perhaps even more injurious 
than caustic soda lye, requiring the 
same cautions and being open to the 
same objections. The addition of 
various other ingredients, as borax, 
ammonia, and the like, may be re- 
garded as beneficial, as they tend to 
increase the cleansing properties of 
the fluid, and thus lessen the amount 
of pure lye necessary to do the work. 

Put * pound of concentrated lye in 
an earthenware jar or iron kettle and 
pour over it 1 gallon of cold water. 
Stir with a wooden stick until dis- 



726 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



solved, and let stand until cold. Dis- 
solve, each in a separate vessel, i 
pound of borax, i pound of salts of 
tartar, and i pound of lump am- 
monia (not aqua ammonia), using in 
each case as little water as possible. 
After the solution of lye is cold, pour 
into it each of the other solutions in 
a thin stream, stirring constantly, 
pour the mixture into large glass bot- 
tles or earthenware jugs, and cork 
tightly. Use this washing fluid in the 
proportion oi 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls 
to each pailful of water. In all cases 
dissolve it in the wash boiler before the 
clothes are put in, for if the clothes 
are put in first and the washing fluid 
afterwards, it will be stronger in some 
places than others, and be more likely 
to injure the garments. 

Or put 1 pound of crude potash in 
an earthenware jug and pour over it 1 
gallon of soft water. When cold stir 
in i ounce of sal ammoniac and ^ 
ounce of saltpeter previously dissolved 
in a little soft water. Use this fluid at 
the rate of 1 pint to 6 or 8 gallons of 
water. 

Washing Fluids with Turpentine. 
— Turpentine as a washing fluid, with 
or without other ingredients, as cam- 
phor, alcohol, ammonia, and the like, 
is often recommended, but unless 
great caution is observed it is very 
likely to be injurious. These sub- 
stances, especially turpentine and al- 
cohol, open the pores of the skin and 
thus expose a person to the liability 
of taking cold in hanging out the 
clothes. Their frequent use is also 
debilitating. Hence these substances 
should not be used when washing is 
done by hand. They are only per- 
missible where the clothes are pounded 
in the old-fashioned way, or the work 
is done by a washing machine. Even 
breatliing the fumes of turpentine in 
the steam of the laundry may be 
dangerous under certain circum- 
stances, and, on the whole, these reci- 
pes should be used only with the great- 
est caution. Clothes washed with 
turpentine should be rinsed very thor- 
oughly to remove all traces of it be- 
fore being worn, as otherwise it will 
be injurious to the skin. 

To a boilerful of hot water add 14 
bars of hard soap shaved fine, 1 table- 



spoonful of spirts of turpentine, and 
1 teaspoonful of aqua ammonia ; bring 
to a boil and stir until all arc dis- 
solved before putting in the clothes. 

Or, in addition to the soap, use 
1 tablespoonful of spirits of turpen- 
tine and 1 tablespoonful of powdered 
borax. 

Or first soap the water in which the 
clothes are to be boiled, then add the 
following: spirits of turpentine, 1 
tablespoonful; aqua ammonia, 1 table- 
spoonful. Housekeepers who have 
used this washing fluid value it highly. 

Washing Pluids with Sal Soda.— 
Dissolve i pound of sal soda and ] 
pound of borax in 1 gallon of boiling 
soft water. Add 2 gallons of cold 
soft water and 1 ounce of gum cam- 
phor dissolved in i pint of alcohol. 
Stir well and put in corked bottles or 
fruit jars. Add 4 teaspoonfuls of 
this preparation to 1 pint of soft soap 
or 1 bar of hard soap cut into fine 
shavings, and dissolve the whole in a 
boilerful of hot water before putting 
in the clothes. 

Or dissolve ^ pound of washing 
soda and ^ pound of borax in 4 
quarts of boiling soft water. When 
cold add i teacupful of aqua am- 
monia and pour into corked bottles 
or fruit jars. Dissolve in the wash 
boiler in the proportion of 1 teacupful 
to 1 pailful of water before the clothes 
are put in. 

Washing Powders. — Commercial 
washing powders, such as pearline, 
soapine, and the like, are said by 
chemists to be composed of hard 
white soap ground to powder and 
mixed with pulverized sal soda in ap- 
proximately equal parts. Hence they 
are liable to the same objections as 
sal soda, which is well known to con- 
tain an excess of alkali. They are, 
however, useful for dishwashing, scrub- 
bing, and many other purposes. They 
can be made at home much more 
cheaply than they can be purchased. 

To make washing powder, melt in 
a double boiler 1 ounce of good white 
glue in 1 gallon of hot water to make 
a thin glue size. Mix equal parts of 
granulated soda ash with granulated 
sal soda, pulverizing them into grains 
about the size of coarse sand by means 
of a rolling pin. Pour over this 



THE HOME LAUNDRY 



727 



mixture the solution of glue, or use in- 
stead pure linseed oil and stir until 
the mass forms a stiff, thick paste. 
Spread out the whole on a table top 
or other flat surface in a warm room 
to dry. 

Or, instead of the solution of glue, 
use a solution of 1 pint of linseed oil 
to 1 gallon of water. 

Soap Jelly. — Dissolve 1 teaspoonful 
of any good washing powder in a 
cupful of hot water, or dissolve any 
desired quantity of shaved hard white 
or yellow soap in twice its own bulk 
of hot water, using a double boiler. 
Use instead of soft soap for delicate 
fabrics. 

Kerosene for Washing. — This is a 
favorite labor-saving article in many 
households. Use for each boilerful of 
water 1 pound of good hard soap in 
shavings and 1 teaspoonful of kero- 
sene to each pail of water, or about 
2^ tablespoonfuls for a wash boiler 
two thirds full of water. Should it be 
necessary to add more water after the 
first or second boiling, put in i pound 
of shaved soap and 1 tablespoonful 
more of kerosene. This mixture will 
not injure fabrics and will evaporate 
when the clothes are laundered so as 
to leave no odor. When kerosene is 
used very little rubbing will be re- 
quired. 

Special Hints. — When rinsing large 
linen pieces, as sheets, tablecloths, and 
large towels, gather the middle of the 
piece into the hand and souse the 
edges in the water several times. This 
leaves the selvage smooth and ready 
for the iron. 

If a little cooked starch is put into 
the rinsing water it will add just 
enough stiffness to launder properly 
and will give to old linen the appear- 
ance of new. 

A little pipe clay dissolved in the 
water in which the linens are washed 
will assist in cleansing the more 
soiled articles, and also in giving them 
the appearance of having been 
bleached. 

The addition of a teaspoonful of 
paraffin will assist in removing 
stains. 

A small vegetable brush may be 
used to apply soap and water to the 
spots on the coarser linens, and a nail- 



brush is convenient to use on the deli- 
cate fabrics. 

Fine cotton goods, as lawns, cam- 
brics, and muslins, should not be 
washed with linen, especially un- 
bleached linen, as the latter has a 
tendency to discolor them. 

Delicate dresses of lawn, muslin, 
cambric, and print goods should not 
be boiled or rubbed with soap. They 
should be washed in tepid water in 
which soap has been previously dis- 
solved, rinsed quickly, and dried in 
the shade. 

A quart of bran sewed into a tight 
bag and boiled in the wash boiler 
will assist in cleansing delicate gar- 
ments. 

The addition of a handful of salt 
helps to set the colors of light cam- 
brics and dotted lawns. 

A little beef gall will brighten yel- 
low, purple, or green tints. 

Handkerchiefs. — Handkerchiefs, 
used by persons who have affections 
of the nose, throat, and lungs, as 
grippe, catarrh, bronchitis, and the 
like, should not be put in laundry 
bags or clothes hampers containing 
the family wash. The easiest and 
most sanitary method of handling 
these articles is to keep for the pur- 
pose a large tin or enameled-ware pan 
containing a strong solution of com- 
mon salt. Drop the handkerchiefs into 
this, place the pan on the stove when 
clear from cooking, and bring to a 
boil. They may now be rinsed with 
clean water and put into the rest of 
the laundry, or the pan may be filled 
with boiling water containing a table- 
spoonful of any good washing pow- 
der, the handkerchiefs returned to it 
and boiled from twenty minutes to 
half an hour, then removed, rinsed, and 
laid aside for ironing. 

To Wash Corsets. — Choose a clear, 
sunny day; make a strong solution of 
good soapsuds and a small amount of 
ammonia, spread the corsets on a 
clean board or table and scrub with 
a good stiff brush until thoroughly 
clean. Apply clear water in the same 
way to rinse them and hang immedi- 
ately in the sun. Do not wring out. 
Let them drip dry, and the shape will 
not be changed. 

Or make good warm suds, lay the 



728 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



corsets on a washboard, and scrub 
thoroughly on both sides mth a stiff 
brush. Then scald a little, rinse thor- 
oughly, starch slightly, and dry. 
When ironed they look much better 
than when rubbed on a washboard. 
Special Pieces. — In addition to the 
regular wash day it is often advisable 
to lay aside small muslins, laces, rib- 
bons, and other delicate articles to be 
washed at other times when they can 
have special attention, rather than to 
put them into the weekly wash. 
Blankets and other heavy articles can 
also be washed to better advantage by 
themselves, and in the season when 
the days are long and bright. 

COLOEED GOODS 

Care for Colored Goods. — All col- 
ored goods, especially light dress goods 
having delicate colors, as colored lin- 
ens, muslins, lawns, or cambrics; and 
prints, as chintz, ginghams, and cali- 
coes, require special care in washing. 
They must be handled separately from 
other articles, and in many respects 
it is better to make a special job of 
washing fine colored goods on another 
day than the regular wash day. Care 
must be taken in washing colored 
goods that the colors do not soak out 
or run. This may be prevented in 
two ways: by a special process in 
washing, different from the method of 
washing white goods, and by the ad- 
dition of various substances to the 
washing or rinsing water to set the 
colors. 

Cantions for Colored Goods. — The 
best general caution for handling col- 
ored goods is to avoid extremes of 
heat or cold, to avoid hard wringing, 
and to wash and do them up as quick- 
ly as possible. They must not be 
soaked or otherwise delayed in wash- 
ing, boiled, scalded, or exposed to di- 
rect sunlight or the heat of a very 
hot iron. No form of washing soda, 
soft soap, or \\''ashing powders or 
fluids containing free alkali should be 
employed. Use pure white or yellow 
neutral soap only for this purpose. 
Neither must they be allowed to 
freeze. 

To prevent the colors from running 
they may be set by adding certain sub- 



stances to the suds or rinsing water 
or both. 

Don'ts for Colored Goods. — Don't 
soak or soap colored goods over night. 

Don't boil them, don't wash in hot 
water, don't use washing fluids, wash- 
ing powders, or anything else contain- 
ing the slightest particle of sal soda. 

Don't put them all into the tub at 
once. 

Don't let them lie any longer than 
necessary in the suds, rinsing water, or 
clothes basket. 

Don't hang them up to dry so that 
the right side will be exposed to the 
hot sun. 

Don't hang them up in the sun at all 
if shade is available. 

Don't iron them with a very hot 
iron. 

To Wash Colored Goods. — Sort out 
the calicoes and other prints, colored 
linens, etc., and prepare suds with cold 
or lukewarm water and good hard 
white or yellow soap. Have at hand 
a tub of rinsing water containing alum, 
oxgall, or other substances to set the 
colors. Wash each piece separately, 
commencing with the lightest in color, 
rinse, and wring it out as quickly as 
possible, leaving the remaining pieces 
in a dry state. Wash all the colored 
articles as quickly as possible, turn 
them wrong side out, and hang them 
up to dry, if possible, in the shade. 

To Suds Colored Goods. — Prepare 
suds by shaving hard white soap in 
soft water at the rate of about half 
a bar to two pailfuls of water. Bring 
the water to a boil, remove from the 
fire, and allow it to cool until it will 
bear the hands comfortably. 

Do not rub soap on delicate colored 
goods. Wash the garments quickly. 
Put them in the water one at a time, 
and rub as little as possible: rather 
souse them up and down in the hot 
suds. If the suds become foul, pre- 
pare a fresh lather. Wash each gar- 
ment by itself as quicklv as possible. 

To Wring Colored Goods. — Do not 
wring out delicate colored articles, but 
squeeze them gently as dry as possible 
between the hands. 

To Rinse Colored Goods. — Rinse in 
two or tliree clear rinsing waters, add- 
ing various ingredients, according to 
the goods, to set the colors. 



THE HOME LAUNDRY 



729 



To Dry Colored Goods. — Select 
bright, clear weather to wash delicate 
and expensive colored garments, and 
when washed hang them to dry in the 
shade. The best goods will fade if 
hung in the sunshine. In freezing 
weather they may be dried indoors by 
the fire, as the colors will be irrep- 
arably injured if they are allowed to 
freeze. 

To Wash Calicoes. — An exception 
•to the rule against soaking colored 
articles is found in the custom of 
soaking calicoes and other print goods 
in a strong solution of salt before 
washing. Authorities variously rec- 
ommend soaking the articles in strong 
salt water for periods of half an hour 
to over night. We would recommend 
experimenting with a sample of the 
goods before soaking delicate or ex- 
pensive fabrics for a long period. 
First soak new calico garments in 
strong salt water. Dissolve 3 gills of 
salt in 1 gallon of hot water, not boil- 
ing. Put in the garments and soak 
until the colors are thoroughly set. 
The time required will vary accord- 
ing to the fabrics, and may be deter- 
mined by experimenting with samples. 
We would recommend 15 minutes to a 
half hour as an average. 

Wash same as other colored goods, 
using alum or oxgall in the suds and 
salt in the rinsing water. Use alum 
preferably for green. 

Black calico may be washed in an 
infusion of potato starch. Peel two 
or three potatoes, scrape them, boil, 
and strain, washing the calico in the 
pure liquid. 

Or wash in an infusion of wheat 
bran as hereinafter suggested. 

Colored Goods — To Fix Their 
Color. — Substances recommended for 
fixing the colors of calicoes and other 
colored articles vary with the colors 
and the nature of the fabric. They in- 
clude oxgall, salt, infusion of hay, 
alum, and lemon Juice or vinegar; for 
red articles, borax, and for black 
goods lye and black pepper. 

Of these, oxgall and salt are the 
most popular. The gall of an ox can 
be obtained from the butcher. It may 
be preserved by adding to it a hand- 
ful of salt, and keeping it corked 
tightly. A bottle of this preparation 



should always be kept on hand in the 
laundry. Use 1 teacupful to 5 gal- 
lons of water. 

Common salt may be used in the 
proportion of i cupful to 2 gallons of 
water; alum, 1 ounce to each gallon 
of water; borax, 1 tablespoon ful to 
the gallon; vinegar or lemon juice, tlie 
same. Add these substances iji the 
above proportion to both suds and rins- 
ing water. 

Or use a large tablespoonful of ox- 
gall in the suds and a teaspoonful of 
vinegar in each rinsing water. 

Or use alum in the suds and vine- 
gar in the rinsing water. 

Do not use both oxgall and alum. 

To Fix light, Solid Colors. — To 
permanently fix blue, slate, and stone 
colors in cotton fabrics, dissolve 1 
ounce of sugar of lead in 2h gallons of 
hot water. Stir with a wooden stick, 
and let stand until lukewarm. Im- 
merse the garments in this solution for 

1 to 2 hours, and hang up to drip dry 
in the shade before washing. Remem- 
ber that sugar of lead is poisonous; 
hence, after being dried, these articles 
should be washed thoroughly and 
rinsed in plenty of clear water. 

To Fix Dark, Solid Colors. — To fix 
black and other dark colors, dissolve 

2 cupfuls of salt in 2J gallons of water, 
immerse the articles until they are 
thoroughly saturated, and hang them 
up to drip dry in a shady place. Add 
a tablespoonful of salt to the rinsing 
water. 

Or, to prevent black goods and 
hosiery from turning brown, use very 
strong bluing in the water. For black 
goods, also, add a teacupful of lye to 
each pailful of soapsuds in which the 
articles are washed. They must be 
washed quickly and the excess of 
lye thoroughly rinsed out in clear 
cold water to which salt has been 
added. 

Or, for black goods, prepare an in- 
fusion of 1 tablespoonful of powdered 
black pepper with sufficient water 
to cover the articles, and steep 
them in it for a half hour before 
washing. 

To Fix Pinks, Reds, and Greens. — 
Vinegar is especially recommended 
for pink, red, or green goods to 
brighten the color; salt for black, blue, 



730 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



and green colors. Hence, to fix pink 
or green, add i cupful of strong vine- 
gar to 2i gallons of water, immerse the 
articles, and let them drip dry in the 
shade. 

To Fix Red or Scarlet. — For red or 
scarlet table napkins add 1 table- 
SDOonful of borax to each gallon of 
soapsuds when washing. 

To Fix Solid-colored Linens. — A 
strong infusion of common hay made 
by boiling the hay and straining off 
the clear liquor is recommended for 
French linens; black pepper, 1 tea- 
spoonful for each pailful of water, for 
gray and brown linens. 

To Wash Colored Goods with Bran. 
— Delicate lawn and muslin dresses, 
also chintz and cretonne, may be 
washed without soap in an infusion 
of wheat bran. This process cannot 
possibly harm the most delicate fab- 
rics. Boil 1 quart of wheat bran in 
3 quarts of water for about 15 min- 
utes, and strain off the clear liquor 
into the wash water. Boil the bran 
again for 15 minutes in an equal 
quantity of water, and strain off the 
resulting infusion into the rinsing 
water. 

For the wash water add to the in- 
fusion of bran about an equal quan- 
tity of clear soft water. Add also, 
to set the colors, a tablespoonful of 
oxgall or a small lump of alum. Use 
no soap, as the bran itself possesses 
sufficient cleansing properties. Wash 
with as little rubbing and wringing as 
possible. 

Rinse first in the lukewarm bran 
water, adding salt, and afterwards in 
clear water containing a little gum 
arable. No starch will be required. 
The bran after having been strained 
may be fed to pigs or chickens. 

To Clean Colored Goods with Raw 
Potatoes. — Grate the potatoes to a 
fine pulp and mix with 1 pint of water 
for each pound of grated potato. Sift 
with a coarse sieve and let the liquid 
settle until the starch accumulates at 
the bottom. The clear liquid remain- 
ing may be bottled for future use. To 
apply, lay a linen towel over the wash- 
board and spread the soiled garment 
upon it. Sponge with the clear liquid 
and afterwards rinse with clear cold 
water. 



LACES AND LACE CURTAINS 

To Wash Lace. — To wash cotton or 
linen lace or embroidery prepare suds 
of hard white soap with hot water, to 
which add 1 or 2 teaspoon fuls of 
borax. If much soiled, boil the articles 
in the suds before or after washing, 
or both. Squeeze them with the hands 
or draw them through the fingers in 
the suds until clean, rinse in clear 
water, add to the last water about i 
teaspoonful of granulated sugar to 1 
pint of water, and iron without starch- 
ing. 

White Laces. — White linen and cot- 
ton laces and embroideries may be 
washed in soapsuds in the same man- 
ner as other delicate white goods, ex- 
cept that more care is required in 
their handling. To prepare these 
goods for the laundry, baste the small 
pieces, as doilies and smaller embroid- 
eries, Battenberg pieces, edging and 
the like, on a piece of linen or cotton 
cloth larger than the lace. Take care 
to catch every point with basting 
thread. Several small articles can be 
basted on one large piece. After 
washing, if the cloth is stretched, the 
lace will dry in perfect condition with- 
out ironing. Fine lingerie, as lace 
waists, etc., may be basted inside a pil- 
low case or special cotton bag pre- 
pared with a draw string for this 
purpose, and need not be taken out 
from tlie time it is put into the first 
wash water until after it is hung on the 
line, dried, and ready to iron. This 
prevents the lace from being frayed 
or torn by buttons catching in it, etc. 
Lace edging and other long pieces may 
be quickly basted on to a piece of 
cloth with the sewing machine by mak- 
ing the stitch long. 

Or, to prepare a long piece of lace 
for the laundry, it may be wound 
around a large glass bottle. First 
surround the bottle with a jacket of 
cotton or linen cloth sewed on. At- 
tach one end of the lace to this cloth 
jacket with basting thread, and roll 
the lace around it, overlapping care- 
fully as in bandaging. Catch the ends 
and'edges through the cloth jacket with 
basting thread. 

To Soak Laces. — If lace is much 
soiled it may be soaked for an hour or 



THE HOME LAUNDRY 



731 



more before washing in suds made 
of cold water and naphtha or curd 
soap. Do not use yellow soap or any 
form of washing compound which may 
contain free alkali. 

To Prepare Laces for the Wash. — 
First remove all stains, and if much 
soiled by perspiration wash in soap 
and cold water, rubbing the soiled 
spots gently between the fingers. 
After the stains have all been removed 
the lace may be washed in warm suds, 
and, if necessary, afterwards boiled. 

To Suds Laces. — Only the purest 
hard white curd soaps should be used 
for washing laces. Many persons save 
the scraps of fine castile and other 
toilet soaps, melt them with a small 
quantity of water in a double boiler, 
and make a soap jelly for use with 
these delicate fabrics. It is better to 
make soapsuds in a small kettle with 
soft water and fine soap in which to boil 
these articles than to put them in the 
regular boiler. If they are not much 
soiled do not boil them, but bring the 
suds to a boil and pour over the laces, 
letting them soak until the water is 
cool enough to bear the hands. Wash 
as other fine goods, stripping between 
the hands as lightly as possible and 
sousing up and down in the suds. Use 
two or more fresh suds if necessary. 

To Boil Laces. — Laces that are 
soiled may be, if prepared and pro- 
tected in the above manner, boiled in 
soapsuds the same as other white 
goods. To boil laces rolled about a 
bottle, first saturate the lace with olive 
oil or sweet oil, prepare strong soap- 
suds, and stand the bottle upright. 
Or the bottle may merely be dropped 
in with other articles. 

To Rinse and Dry. — Rinse laces 
thoroughly in clear water, pressing 
the water out of them with the hands 
and dry in the hot sun without remov- 
ing from the cloth or bottle which pro- 
tect them. 

Point Lace and Battenberg. — Point 
lace may be washed as other laces if 
very carefully basted to a piece of 
fine white flannel and another piece of 
flannel basted over it. Care must be 
taken to catch all the points, using 
very fine basting thread. After rins- 
ing, the flannel must be carefully 
stretched, and while still damp ironed, 



without removing the lace, until per- 
fectly dry. 

Or the professional method may be 
employed, which is as follows: stretch 
the lace, face down, on a piece of 
clean white duck and carefully tack it 
on, using very fine basting thread and 
taking pains to catch all the points. 
Stretch the duck tent fashion over a 
rod out of doors on a clear day. Make 
a lather of fine castile or curd soap 
and apply the soapsuds with a soft 
brush, as an old toothbrush or a nail- 
brush with soft bristles, or with a 
sponge, until it is thoroughly cleaned. 
Rinse by pouring over it water con- 
taining a little alum. Add a little 
bluing to the last rinsing water. Ap- 
ply thin starch or a solution of gum 
arable with a sponge, and when nearly 
dry lay a Turkish towel over the iron- 
ing board, put the duck on this with 
the lace underneath, and iron the duck. 
This is a perfectly safe method and 
gives a polish which cannot be acquired 
in any other way. 

To Wash a White Lace Veil.— If 
not much soiled, first wash in cold 
water with castile or curd soap, squeez- 
ing between the fingers without rub- 
bing. When stains and spots have 
disappeared, squeeze gently from the 
cold water and pour over it the hot 
suds. Let stand until cool enough to 
bear the hands, and continue squeezing 
vith the fingers until perfectly clean, 
changing the suds if necessary. If 
much soiled, put the veil in a cotton 
bag and boil ten or fifteen minutes. 
Rinse in cold water with a little blu- 
ing, and starch with a thin solution of 
gum arable, rice water, or corn starch. 
Stretch to its original shape and spread 
over a linen towel stretched tent fash- 
ion out of doors, and in the bright sun 
if possible. Pull the edges out to their 
proper shape and fasten with pins. 
When nearly dry iron on a Turkish 
towel through a piece of flannel or 
linen cloth. 

To Wash Black Lace. — Make suds 
of castile or other hard white soap 
and boiling water, and add a table- 
spoonful of oxgall to set the color. 
Allow this to cool until it will bear 
the hand, then immerse the Ince and 
cleanse by squeezing gently with the 
fingers. Rinse in two or more cold 



732 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



waters, adding salt to the first and 
bluing to the last. Starch with a thin 
solution of gum arable or common 
glue made by dissolving a piece of thin 
glue about an inch square in a quart 
of boiling water. Or use thin rice 
water or cornstarch. Lay over black 
silk or cambric stretched tent fash- 
ion, stretch, and pin the edges securely. 
When dry arrange face down on a 
Turkish towel, and iron through a thin 
cloth, following the pattern with the 
point of the iron. Use a warm, not 
hot, iron, as much heat will turn the 
lace rusty. 

To Sponge Black lace. — First dust 
the articles thoroughly and stretch, 
face down, over a piece of black goods, 
tacking down the edges with basting 
thread. Sponge with dilute ammonia 
and water. 

Or sponge with green tea. 

Or use borax water in the propor- 
tion of 1 teaspoonful of borax to 1 
pint of soft water. 

Use, if convenient, an old black kid 
glove as a sponge. Press while still 
damp and without removing from the 
cloth to which it is basted. Lay the 
lace on a Turkish towel protected by 
a piece of dry black goods and iron 
through the protecting cloth on the 
wrong side, using a warm, not hot, 
iron. 

Or a long piece of lace may be 
wound about a bottle and put in a 
warm place to dry. Avoid the direct 
heat of the sun or of a hot stove or 
iron, as these tend to give black arti- 
cles a rusty appearance. 

Lace Curtains — When to launder 
Them. — Have a special day at house- 
cleaning time for lace curtains, doilies, 
dresser scarfs, and all articles of fancy 
work. These require suds made of 
fancy soap and more care in the laun- 
dry than ordinary articles; hence they 
should be handled by themselves and 
given special treatment. After being 
done up they can be laid away until 
housecleaning is finished, and put up 
as each room is cleaned. 

To Air Lace Curtains. — Lace cur- 
tains may be cleaned easily and will 
not need washing so often if hung on 
the line on a clear day with a gentle 
breeze — not too windy — and dusted 
by the wind. Washing these articles 



is a delicate and difficult business, and 
they necessarily sutfer more or less 
from the process. 

To Prepare Curtains for the Laun- 
dry. — Stitch a narrow piece of tape 
along the hem of net or lace curtains 
before they go to the laundry. This 
keeps the curtain from puUing out of 
shape when ironed. Lay tlie curtains 
on an old sheet and brush them care- 
fully with a soft brush to remove tlie 
dust. Fold them separately as a table- 
cloth is folded, taking care to keep the 
edges perfectly together until the folds 
are about two feet square. Baste a 
strip of white muslin along the edges 
to keep the package in order and quilt 
slightly with basting thread. In this 
shape large curtains can be put into 
suds and cleaned with a pounder or 
otherwise. 

Or fold them carefully and insert in 
a piUowcase, running through them at 
intervals strong basting thread to 
keep them flat and prevent their 
bunching in the end of the case. 

Or tliey may be carefully gathered 
crosswise and tied loosely in a bunch 
by two or three cords at intervals. 
Wash like other fine white goods, first, 
if much soiled, soaking for an hour 
or more in soap and cold water, next 
rubbing gently between the hands in 
warm or hot soapsuds, and afterwards 
boiling in one or more hot suds ac- 
cording to their condition. Rinse first 
in hot water, afterwards two or three 
times in cold water, adding bluing to 
the last. Kerosene, ammonia, or tur- 
pentine mav be used in the boiling 
water, but no washing powders that 
may contain free alkali. 

Or put the curtain in a large tin 
funnel wth a wooden handle attached 
to it; work it through suds and rins- 
ing water in such a way that the water 
will pass through the curtain and out 
at the bottom of the funnel, removmg 
the dirt by suction. This process will 
not injure the most delicate fabrics, 
no matter how long it may continue. 

Colored Curtains. — If "there is any 
doubt about colors being fast, deli- 
cate-colored curtains may be cleansed 
with gasohne. 

To Dry Curtains. — If curtains are 
dried out of doors, cover the line on 
which they are hung with one or more 



THE HOME LAUNDRY 



733 



thicknesses of paper or throw over it 
a dry sheet. This will prevent the 
clothespin from marking the articles 
and keep them from being injured by 
the wind. 

Or, if the curtains arc folded and 
basted together with muslin, dry them 
before taking them out of the folds. 

Or lay a blanket on the floor and 
spread the wet curtains on it, stretch- 
ing them carefully. They will keep 
their place and dry without fastening. 

To Stretch Curtains. — A curtain 
stretcher is not used in most families, 
and hence is something of a luxury. 
Sometimes two or three families in a 
neighborhood can combine to purchase 
one for their common use. As a sub- 
stitute lay a sheet or clean wrapping 
paper on the floor, stretch the cur- 
tains over this, and fasten by means 
of heavy pins called bank pins, which 
can be obtained at the stores. Use a 
pin for each scallop, driving them in- 
to the floor with a tack hammer. Lay 
other curtains over these, hooking them 
on the same pins, as is done on 
stretchers. Several curtains may be 
hooked on the same set of pins. The 
pins may be afterwards removed and 
used again. 

Or the curtains may be pinned to a 
sheet laid upon the carpet, two or 
three curtains by carefully matching 
the scallops being pinned down at the 
same time. 

Or stretch a sheet on a quilting 
frame, and pin the curtains to this. 

Or, while damp, hang the curtains, 
one at a time, on a curtain rod, and 
slip a hea^y rod or curtain pole 
through the hem at the bottom. Stretch 
the curtains to their full width, and 
allow them to hang until dry. The 
weight of the rod at the bottom will 
stretch them sufficiently. 

SILKS AND SATINS 

To launder Silks. — To wash silk 
dresses and other garments, ribbons, 
handkerchiefs, stockings, and the like, 
first rip apart made-up garments, 
shake, and brush tlioroughly to free 
them from dust. Prepare soap jelly 
by cutting castile or other good white 
hard soap into shavings, pour over it 
about double its own bulk of water, 



and dissolve by gentle heat. Have 
ready two or three tubs or pans and 
ftU these partly full of hot water. 
Thus the washing and rinsing waters 
will cool alike and always be of ex- 
actly the same temperature. This is 
the great point to observe in washing 
all animal fibers, as silks or woolens. 

In the first receptacle dissolve 
enough soap jelly to make good suds, 
and let stand until the hands can be 
comfortably borne in the water. Wash 
each piece separately in the suds by 
sousing it up and down, raising it in 
one hand and stripping it through 
the fingers wth the other. Continue 
this process until clean, but without 
creasing, wringing, or squeezing it. 
When washed clean, strip through the 
fingers to remove suds. If soiled spots 
do not come out, rub on a little soap 
jellj'^ and immediately dip again into 
the suds. Change the suds if neces- 
sary. Rinse in clear water, following 
the same process as in washing, strip 
out the water between the fingers, or 
shake out the pieces without wring- 
ing, and iron at once without hanging 
up to dry. 

Or for delicate fabrics, as China 
silk, pongee, and similar dress goods, 
for each article, as a waist or sum- 
mer gown, put 11/. pints of bran in a 
bag of white muslin, and pour over it 
sufficient boiling water to wash the 
garment. When the hands can be 
borne in it comfortably, squeeze the 
bag in the water to extract the solu- 
tion of bran. Add 1 or 2 teaspoon- 
fuls of powdered borax, wash, rinse 
in clear water, and iron at once. Use 
no starch, as the bran gives sufficient 
stiffness. 

To Wash Colored Silks. — The same 
cautions must be observed in washing 
colored silks as in the case of other 
colored goods, with the additional cau- 
tion that they must not be crushed, 
squeezed or wrung when wet, or 
wrinkles may be formed which will 
not iron out. Prepare suds for silk 
by dissolving hard while soap in boil- 
ing water, and add oxgall or alum to 
set the colors. Allow the suds to cool 
until they will bear the hands, and 
immerse the silk in them. Lay the 
washboard across the tub, spread nn 
old towel or piece of flannel over it, 



734 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



lay the silk flat on this, and apply the 
suds by rubbing gently with a soft 
cloth or a sponge, or a toothbrush or 
nailbrush having medium liard bris- 
tles. When the silk is clean apply 
cold water with tlie brush and after- 
wards souse in cold water containing 
salt. If the silk is of solid color, dis- 
solve a little dye the color of the silk 
in the rinsing water. If the color has 
faded this will restore it. Silk gar- 
ments rinsed in diluted dye water will 
come out nearly as fresh as new. 

To Wash a Crepe de Chine or any 
Light Weight Silk Dress. — Dissolve 
five cents' worth of soap bark in luke- 
warm rain water and wash tlie dress 
in this with the hands. Rinse in clear 
water, and iron when nearly dry. It 
will look like new. 

To Wash White Silk. — Prepare 
suds as for other delicate white goods 
by using hard white soap, but no soda 
or washing compounds containing free 
alkali. Cleanse the silks by applying 
tlie soapsuds with a soft cloth or 
brush, rinse in cold water, partially 
dry in the sun, and while still damp 
iron between two cloths on the wrong 
side. 

To Wash Satin. — Satins may be 
washed in the same manner as silks, 
or sponge the way of the grain with 
a weak solution of borax. 

To Wash Silk Stockings. — Prepare 
a lather and wash as other silk goods. 
For white stockings add a little blu- 
ing to the last rinsing water. For 
other tints add a little dye of the re- 
quired color. Stretch the stockings 
to their proper shape, and pin or 
baste them between two thicknesses of 
a clean linen towel. Stretch this tent 
fashion, and the stockings will dry in 
their natural shape without ironing. 

Or wash in bran water. 

WOOLENS, WORSTEDS; AND FLAN- 
NELS 

To Wash Woolen Goods and Flan- 
nels. — Washing woolen goods and 
flannels without shrinking them or 
causing them to lose their natural 
softness and delicate colors is one of 
the best tests of the skillful laun- 
dress. 

Cautions for Woolen Goods. — 



Woolen and flannel goods must not be 
soaked, boiled, scalded, or wrung out 
by twisting. They must not be dried 
near a hot fire. The fibers of wool 
are hooked and curled, and when they 
are crushed together by rubbing they 
form knots, which thicken the fiber 
and shrink it in both dimensions. This 
is one of the principal causes of the 
shrinking that is so much feared. Or 
the expansion or contraction caused 
by alternate heat and cold may cause 
the fibers to interlace. Flannels may 
be shrunk, if desired, before they are 
made up by first placing them in cold 
and afterwards in hot water. But 
they can be washed without shrinking 
if proper precautions are observed. 

To Suds Woolens and Flannels. — 
Prepare suds by dissolving 1 bar of 
hard white soap shaved fine in a boil- 
erful of water and adding 2 table- 
spoonfuls of aqua ammonia. Do not 
use yellow soap which contains borax 
or soda in any form, or washing fluids 
and powders of the composition of 
which you know nothing. Pour the 
suds into a tub and allow them to be- 
come cool enough to bear the hands 
comfortably before putting in the 
flannels. Wash these articles one at 
a time as quickly as possible. Do not 
rub soap on them or rub them on the 
washboard. Souse them up and down 
in the water and rub them together 
with the hands until cleaned. Do not 
put them through the wringer or 
wring by twisting, but squeeze out 
the soapsuds with the hands, shake 
out carefully, stretch, and wash in a 
second lather prepared like the first, 
but not so strong. Rinse in warm 
water as near the temperature of the 
suds as possible, to which a little 
bluing may be added, press out the 
rinsing water, shake vigorously, and 
stretch the articles to prevent slirink- 

Pull each piece as nearly as possi- 
ble into its proper shape and hang 
up carefully in such a way that the 
sliape may be preserved. A clear, 
bright day with sunshine and a light 
breeze is " desirable. Flannels should 
be taken down while still slightly 
damp and rolled up in a dry cloth. 
If the weather is not clear they may 
be dried indoors, but not near the 



THE HOME LAUNDRY 



735 



stove. The object should be to avoid 
extreme changes of temperature, as 
these cause flannels to shrink and be- 
come hard. 

To Wash Colored Woolens and 
Flannels. — Wash colored woolens and 
flannels same as other colored goods, 
adding oxgall or alum to the suds to 
set the colors, and salt or vinegar, or 
both, to the rinsing water. Omit the 
use of ammonia or borax. A tea- 
spoonful of glycerine added to the 
rinsing water makes the flannels come 
out like new. Dry delicate colored 
flannels in the shade. 

To Wash Colored Woolen Dress 
Goods. — Cashmere, merino, alpaca, 
and llama dresses and colored worst- 
ed and flannel waists and blouses may 
be washed in suds prepared as for 
other colored woolen goods, provid- 
ed the same cautions are observed. 
Do not soak, boil, or scald any woolen 
goods. Do not use any form of soda, 
lye, or unknown washing fluids or pow- 
ders. Do not use borax or ammonia for 
delicate colored articles. Use pure 
neutral white or yellow soap shaved 
and dissolved in boiling water until 
it will bear the hands comfortably, 
and keep the suds and rinsing water 
at the same lukewarm temperature. 
Rub and wring as lightly as possible, 
rather sousing the garments up and 
down and squeezing out the water 
with the hands. Add oxgall or alum 
to the suds, and salt or vinegar to 
the rinsing water to set the colors. 
Dry delicate colors in the shade. 
Avoid direct sunlight or proximity to 
a hot fire. Take down before dry and 
iron while damp, but without sprin- 
kling. 

Soap Jelly or Woolen Goods. — To 
avoid preparing suds by shaving soap 
and boiling each time, it is convenient 
to prepare in advance a soap jelly, as 
follows: shave any amount of neutral 
white or yellow soap in the propor- 
tion of Vs pound of soap to 1 quart of 
boiling water and simmer until dis- 
solved. When cold it will jell. Use 
this jelly in the proportion of 1 heap- 
ing tablespoonful to Va gallon of warm 
water to prepare suds for washing all 
flannels or woolen goods. This saves 
the time required to bring the water 
to a boil. 



To Wash Dress Goods with Rice. — 
Boil 2 pounds of rice in 12 quarts 
of water for 2 or 3 hours. Pour half 
of this into a tub, and when cool 
enough to bear the hands put the 
garments in and wash them with the 
soft boiled rice the same as with soap. 
Strain the other half through cheese 
cloth. Put the solid part into an- 
other tub of warm water and wash 
the garments once in this. Rinse in 
clear warm water, and a second time 
in warm water in which the clear rice 
water that was reserved for this pur- 
pose has been added. This will take 
the place of starch. No soap or 
starch need be used. The rice should 
be boiled a day or two in advance and 
kept in readiness, so that garments 
may be washed early in the morning 
and done up the same day. 

Woolen Fancy Work — Crochet, 
etc. — SmaU and delicate woolen arti- 
cles may be put into a cotton bag or 
tied up in a pillowcase and washed the 
same as other woolen articles. The 
suds and rinsing v/ater should be plen- 
tiful. The articles need not be taken 
out of the bag while washing, and 
they may be hung up in it on the line 
to dry. 

Woolen Table Covers. — First re- 
move all stains and grease spots; next 
soak thirty minutes in strong salt 
water. Prepare suds, wash, rinse, and 
dry same as other colored woolen 
goods. If much soiled, apply soap and 
water with a scrubbing brush, laying 
the cloth on the washboard placed 
crosswise upon the tub. 

To Wash Knitted Shawls.— Knitted 
or crocheted shawls may be folded as 
flat as possible and laid carefully in 
a pillowcase, run through at inter- 
vals with basting thread to keep flat, 
and treated like other flannel or wool- 
en goods. If washed separately, ob- 
serve the usual cautions for woolen 
goods, gently squeezing through the 
hands and keeping the suds and rins- 
ing water of tlie same lukewarm tem- 
perature. Do not hang knitted goods 
up to dry, but put in the oven on a 
big platter, shaking and turning oc- 
casionally, or lay on a clean cloth in 
the bright sunshine. 

Woolen Shawls. — The most delicate 
colored cashniere and other woolen 



7S6 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



shawls may be washed in soapsuds if 
proper precautions are observed. Make 
suds same as for other woolen goods 
by dissolving 1 pound of hard white 
soap in 214 pailfuls of water. Add 1 
tablespoonful of oxgall or 2 ounces 
of alum and wash the articles by sous- 
ing up and down, rubbing as little as 
possible. Squeeze the water out of 
them and rinse in two or three waters, 
each containing a teaspoonful of salt. 
Place between two dry sheets to wring 
out and wring lightly. Press while 
still damp with a warm, not hot, 
iron. 

To Wash Blankets. — Choose a 
warm, sunny day with a gentle breeze. 
Prepare suds by dissolving in hot 
water Vs bar of any good white hard 
soap, 1 tablespoonful of borax and 1 
tablespoonful of aqua ammonia for 
each pair of blankets. Let the suds 
cool until they will bear the hands. 
Immerse the blankets and let them 
stand in the suds for an hour, keeping 
the temperature about as hot as the 
hands will bear by frequently adding 
hot water. Do not rub soap on the 
blankets nor scour nor rub them. Lay 
the washboard flat across the tub, put 
in one blanket at a time, raise the 
blanket on to the washboard and go 
around the edge, applying the suds 
with a scrubbing brush and rubbing 
vigorously. Meantime heat sufficient 
water for two more lathers. Remove 
from tlie first to a second suds pre- 
pared in the same manner, seize the 
blanket by the middle and souse it up 
and down. Squeeze and press it be- 
tween the hands until clean. Rinse in 
three clear waters, keeping them at 
the same temperature as the suds, 
namely, as hot as the hands will bear, 
and run through the wringer or 
squeeze the water out of them rather 
than wring them in the usual way. 
Fasten by the edges to the line and 
frequently shake and stretch them to 
their proper size while drying. To 
have the best success in washing 
blankets two points must be observed, 
namely: to keep the water at a uni- 
form temperature, neither boiling hot 
nor cold enough to chill, but as hot 
as the hands will bear; and not to 
wring or rub the blankets in such 
a way that the fibers will become in- 



terlaced and cause shrinking. When 
thoroughly dry beat the blankets 
while on the line with a carpet beater. 
This will cause the wool to become 
fluffy like a new blanket. 

To Wash Bedspreads.— If bed- 
spreads are changed quite frequently 
they will not require soaking, but if 
very much soiled they may be soaked 
by putting them in a tub and pour- 
ing over them a boilerful of hot water 
in which 2 tablespoonfuls of borax 
has been dissolved. Prepare suds by 
dissolving 1 bar of hard white op 
yellow soap in a boilerful of hot 
water and wash same as other white 
goods. Do not use any form of soda, 
lye, or any washing fluids or com- 
pounds. If washed on a windy day, 
bedspreads will need no ironing. 
Fold the edges together and pin them 
on the line with the wrong side out. 
This not only prevents the spread 
from wearing across the middle, but 
gives it a fresher appearance than 
ironing. 

To Wash Comforters. — Sometimes 
a heavy comforter can be washed 1^ 
simply tacking it smoothly on a clean 
shingle roof and letting the rain fall 
on it. It is well to previously soak it 
for half an hour or more in a strong 
solution of common salt to prevent 
the colors running. 

Or soak the comforter for an hour 
or two in borax water. Prepare suds 
as for other colored goods, with the 
addition of oxgall or alum and salt. 
Lay the washboard across the top of 
the tub and apply the suds with a 
soft scrubbing brush, especially round 
the edges. Continue as in washing 
blankets. Those who have a supply 
of running water may use the garden 
hose for rinsing blankets, bedspreads, 
and comforters. Remove from the 
suds without wringing, hang them on 
a line, and drench them with water 
from the hose until they are rinsed 
thoroughly. 

BLUING AND SPRINKIING 

Bluing. — It is very difficult to rinse 
clothes quite free from all traces of 
soap or other washing compounds. 
The minute quantities of alkali left 
in the fabrics tend to give white arti- 



THE HOME LAUNDRY 



7a7 



cles a dincy or yellow tinge. The ob- 
ject of bluing is to correct this. 
Hence it is customary to add bluing 
to the last rinsing water for white 
articles or colored goods that have a 
white background. For dark colored 
goods it is also customary to add a 
liberal supply of bluing to the starch. 
Some laundresses do not wring from 
the bluing water table linens and 
similar articles which they desire to 
have a fine, clear white, but hang 
them up dripping in order to deepen 
their luster. 

To Make Bluing'. — Dissolve 1 ounce 
of the best soluble Prussian blue pow- 
der and 1/2 ounce of powdered oxalic 
acid in 1 quart of soft water. 

Sprinkling. — The object of sprin- 
kling is to give the garments a uni- 
form dampness, to soften wrinkles, 
and to prevent the iron from scorch- 
ing. Hence the clothes should be 
sprinkled slightly and afterwards 
rolled up and allowed to lie until the 
moisture has uniformly penetrated 
all parts of the fabric. Delicate col- 
ored goods, flannels and other wool- 
ens, and fine linens mil have a better 
appearance if ironed on the same 
day that they were washed than if 
allowed to become entirely dry before 
ironing. Colored goods especially 
should not be sprinkled if it can be 
avoided. 

Starch and Starching. — The 
amount of starch to prepare for a 
given wasliing depends upon the arti- 
cles to be starched, and must be deter- 
mined in each family by experiment. 
The ability to do up starched linen 
perfectly is one of the most severe 
tests of the successful laundress. 
Hence the importance of knowing how 
to prepare good starch. First mix the 
required amount of common starch 
with a small quantitj'^ of cold water 
to the consistency of cream. Care- 
fully rub and beat the starch with a 
spoon to break up all lumps and in- 
sure that the particles of starch are 
evenly wet through. Thin to the con- 
sistency of milk with a little more cold 
water. For thick cooked starch add 8 
parts of boiling water to 1 of starch. 
For thin cooked starch add 16 parts 
of water to 1 of starch. Pour the 
water while boiling vigorously in a 



thin stream, and stir constantly to pre- 
vent the starch from lumping. Set 
the starch over the fire and continue 
to boil it from 3 to 5 minutes, stirring 
vigorously all the time. If such sub- 
stances as wax, borax, oil, etc., are 
used, they should be mixed with the 
starch while cooking. Bluing should 
not be added until the starch is cold. 
Raw starch or that which has been 
insufficiently cooked will stick to the 
iron and make much trouble for the 
laundress. Cooked starch may be 
thinned by the addition of cold water. 

Cornstarch. — Common cornstarch, 
such as is used for making puddings, 
is preferred by some laundresses in- 
stead of the ordinary laundry starch. 
It is about as cheap and in the 
opinion of many gives a finer gloss 
and more finished appearance to deli- 
cate starched articles. Try this some 
time when the laundry starch is 
out and see how you like jt. A mix- 
ture of the two kinds is also much 
favored. 

Additions to Starch. — Among the 
various substances added to starch for 
different purposes are wax, borax, salt, 
soap, lard, sugar, gum arable, glue, 
stearin, and glycerin. Borax makes 
the starch more fluid, so that it goes 
farther, and also increases the gloss. 
Salt prevents the starch from freezing 
in garments; wax and gum arable and 
stearin increase the gloss and give 
additional stiflFness, and soap and 
sugar improve the gloss. These sub- 
stances may also be mixed together 
according to various special recipes. 

Starch with Wax. — For wliite 
cuffs, collars, and shirt bosoms melt 
with gentle heat white wax or a mix- 
ture of equal parts of white wax and 
spermaceti or a mixture of 1 part of 
white wax to 9 parts of spermaceti, as 
preferred, and stir into ordinary 
starch while boiling. Use a lump of 
wax about the size of a walnut to a 

auart of cooked starch, or estimate 
le amount of wax in the proportion 
of l^g to X^ of the bulk of dry 
starch required for the garments 

Starch with Borax. — Add 1 table- 
spoonful of borax to each pint of 
cooked starch while boiling. This 
makes the starch go farther by lessen- 
ing the amount that adheres to each 



738 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



garment. It increases the gloss with- 
out giving additional stiffness and 
tends to prevent the irons from sticlc- 
ing. 

Or add 1 teaspoonful of borax to 1 
pint of uncooked starch for garments 
requiring stiffness. 

Starch with Salt. — Add 1 teaspoon- 
ful of table salt to 1 pint of cooked 
or uncooked starch. This prevents the 
starch from being whipped out of the 
garments by the wind when drying, 
and also from freezing in severely cold 
weather. 

Or add 1 teaspoonful of Epsom 
salts to each bowl of cooked starch 
while boiling. Tliis will add stiffness 
and tend to prevent the articles from 
being scorched by hot irons. 

Starch with Soap. — Make the boil- 
ing water in which starch is cooked 
slightly soapy with pure castile or 
other neutral white soap. This will 
assist in producing a gloss and will 
also prevent the irons from sticking. 

Starch with Gum Arabic. — Prepare 
a solution of gum arable by putting 
about 2 ounces of the white gum fine- 
ly powdered in a glass bottle or quart 
fruit jar and pouring over it 1 pint 
of boiling water. Cork tightly and 
shake until the powder is dissolved. 
After 24 hours strain through cheese 
cloth and preserve the clear gum wa- 
ter for use. Add 1 tablespoonful to 
each pint of cooked starch while boil- 
ing. This is especially useful for fine 
dress goods, either white or colored, 
as lawns, muslins, calicoes, and the 
like, giving them much of the body 
and appearance of new material. Less 
of the gum water may be used for the 
finished materials, as muslins, and 
more may be added for cuffs, collars, 
and shirt cuffs to increase the stiff- 
ness and impart a gloss. 

Starch with Sugar. — To give 
the so-called domestic finish, add a 
teaspoonful of granulated sugar to 
each pint of starch while boiling. 

Starch with Stearin. — Add a tea- 
spoonful of stearin to each pint of 
starch when boiling. This substance 
with the addition of bluing is sold 
under the name of " starch luster " at 
a much higher price than the stearin 
itself costs, and is no better. 
Starch with Lard. — Add half a 



teaspoonful of lard or butter to each 
quart of cooked starch when boiling. 
This helps to give the soft or domes- 
tic finish, and prevents the irons from 
sticking. 

To Apply Starch. — Strain the hot 
starch through a piece of cheese cloth 
and use while it is still warm. Select 
first the articles that require the most 
stiffness, as shirt bosoms, collars, and 
cuffs. A portion of the starch of 
course adheres to each, so that it be- 
comes thinner by using. Starched 
clothes such as skirts, etc., should 
never be stiff enough to rattle. The 
garments to be starched should be 
nearly dry. Immerse them, or such 
part of them as should be starched, in 
the thick starch, and rub between the 
hands to \vork the starch thoroughly 
into their texture. Remove from the 
starch, squeeze out the excess, and rub 
once more with the hands to distribute 
the starch evenly through the mate- 
rial. If this is not done the surface 
will not iron smoothly. Dry the arti- 
cles, sprinkle them, spread them on a 
clean white cloth, and roll them up 
in bundles so that the dampness will 
be evenly distributed before ironing. 

To Starch Colored Clothes. — Di- 
vide the starch, set apart the required 
amount for colored clothes, and add 
bluing sufficient to make the starch 
quite blue. Use a liberal supply of 
bluing for blacks and dark colors, but 
not so much for light garments, es- 
pecially pink. This will prevent white 
patches of starch from appearing on 
dark garments. 

Or dip black or colored goods, as 
lawns and calicoes, in sweet or sour 
milk and use no starch. Milk alone 
will give the desired stiffness. 

Or, for delicate colored goods, use 
a simple solution of gum arable in- 
stead of starch. 

Or rinse in dilute bran water or rice 
water instead of starch. 

To Starch White Dress Goods.— 
Thin white dress goods, as white 
waists and summer gowns, may be 
starched with cold raw starch. Dry 
without starching. Dissolve a heap- 
ing tablespoonful of starch in suf- 
ficient water to immerse the garment, 
dip it into the starch until saturated, 



THE HOME LAUNDRY 



739 



rinse in cold water, wring out, roll up 
in a dry cloth, and iron half an hour 
later. 

Or dry the garments, dip a clean 
muslin cloth into raw starch, and lay 
over them long enough to dampen 
them. After a few minutes press 
them with a hot iron. 

For delicate lawns and similar fab- 
rics use a solution of gum arable di- 
luted to give the stiffness required. 

IRONING 

To Iron Shirts. — Starch the shirt 
bosoms, collars, and cufifs in cooked 
starch containing also wax or lard or 
other similar substance. The addition 
of gum arabic will increase the stiff- 
ness. First use the common iron in 
the usual way, making the surface 
smooth, but without polishing. Iron 
first the back and sleeves, next the 
collar and bosom, last the front. The 
dull or domestic finish, as it is called, 
is preferred by many persons to a 
high polish, but if the latter is de- 
sired use a smooth hard-wood board 
covered rather thickly with cloth on 
one side, but not on the other. First 
use the padded side of the board, 
ironing the bosom smooth, then turn 
the board, lay the bosom upon the 
hard wood, take the polishing iron, and 
polish by rubbing vigorously cross- 
wise. A good polishing iron should 
weigh between 6 and 7 pounds and 
have a rounded edge at the heel. The 
iron is not laid down flat, but only 
the edge of the heel is used to give 
the polish. Keep the iron very hot 
and dampen the bosom slightly before 
using it by brushing with a damp 
cloth or sponge. If the bosom rises 
in wavelike blisters, dampen it slightly 
and go over it again. It requires a 
little care to use a polishing iron, but 
with experience any laundress can give 
as good a polish as can be produced 
in a steam laundry. A greater finish 
can be obtained by laying over the 
bosom a cloth dipped in starch just 
before the polishing iron is applied. 

To Iron Colored Goods. — Colored 
goods should be ironed, when possible, 
before they are quite dry. They 
should not, as a rule, be sprinkled nor 



allowed to lie over night. The iron 
should be allowed to cool slightly, as 
delicate colors, especially pinks and 
greens, will frequently fade as soon 
as they are touched by a hot iron. 
The pink may turn to purple and the 
green to blue. 

If, however, colored goods cannot 
be ironed the day they are washed, 
they should not be allowed to lie over 
night in a wet condition, but should 
first be thoroughly dried and then 
slightly dampened just before iron- 
ing by rolling them in a damp cloth 
and allowing them to stand for fif- 
teen or twenty minutes. 

Press colored goods on the wrong 
side, especially the collars and cuffs. 
Iron on the right side no more then 
is absolutely necessary to take out the 
wrinkles. 

To Iron Black Sateen and Farmer's 
Satin. — Use no starch. Iron on the 
wrong side. 

To Iron Fancy Work. — Press rib- 
bons, lace, and embroidery on the 
wrong side, and iron delicate articles 
through a piece of linen. For colored 
silks and ribbons, allow the iron to 
cool slightly as with any other col- 
ored goods. 

To Iron Linen. — The appearance of 
linen will be improved if it is ironed 
the same day it is washed and with- 
out hanging out to dry. Rinse thor- 
oughly, wring dry, and roll the linen 
articles in a dry sheet. Let them lie 
for a time and iron dry with a hot 
iron. This saves the wear on fine linen 
of whipping on a clothesline, and gives 
an additional stiffness and luster, es- 
pecially to cheap linens and well-worn 
articles. 

To Do TTp Handkerchiefs. — To save 
ironing, spread the handkerchief wet 
from rinsing water on a clean pane 
of glass or mirror. When dry, fold 
and lay away. Guests at summer 
hotels and persons who are boarding 
will find this plan very convenient. 
It is especially desirable for fine linen 
and delicate lace handkerchiefs, to 
save the wear and tear of the laun- 
dry. 

ironing Hints. — Talile linen and 
handkerchiefs frequently show wear 
where the customary folds have been 



740 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



ironed in. To save wear press the 
article all over until perfectly dry, 
without folding. Then fold and press 
the folds lightly with a hot iron. The 
appearance will be the same as if the 
folds had been ironed separately, but 
the articles will wear longer. 

Large tablecloths that are awkward 
to manage without folding may be 
rolled upon curtain poles as fast as 
they are ironed. ^Mien the entire 
cloth has been ironed it may be un- 
rolled and folded with a light pres- 
sure. 

The clothes wringer will smooth 
sheets, towels, pillowcases, and the 
like sufficiently w'ithout ironing, and 
upon occasion these articles may be 
folded and put away rough dry. Give 
handkerchiefs one fold less than is 
customary, leaving them oblong in- 
stead of square. The economy of time 
is small, but the handkerchiefs lie 
more conveniently in the drawer. 

To Iron Embroidery. — Embroid- 
ered articles, as doilies, shirt waists, 
and the like, Hamburg trimmings, and 
other goods of similar texture may be 
ironed over a Turkish towel. This 
method raises the pattern clearly and 
beautifully. It may also be used for 
napkins, handkerchiefs, and table- 
cloths. The towel yields slightly, less- 
ening the labor of ironing, and the 
process adds to the appearance of the 
article. 

TO DO TIP SIIKS, RIBBONS, AND 
WOOLENS 

To Iron Silks. — Lift silks from the 
rinsing water, shake and snap them 
to remove as much water as possible 
without squeezing or wringing, and 
smooth them out on pieces of old cot- 
ton cloth or towels. Roll them uji in 
these and iron as soon as possible 
without drying. Smooth pieces out 
while wet on the ironing board, lay 
over them a piece of thin white mus- 
lin, and iron on the wrong side with 
a moderate iron to prevent smutting. 
Now remove the cloth, iron perfectly 
dry on the wrong side, and smooth 
slightly, if desired, on the face with a 
warm, not hot, iron. The whole proc- 
ess of washing and ironing should 



be done as quickly as possible after 
the silk is wet, as the colors may 
be affected by lying in that condition. 

To Iron Colored Silks. — Like other 
colored goods silk should not be al- 
lowed to dry, but should be ironed 
while still damp with a warm, not 
hot, iron. Place between two clotbl 
and iron on the wrong side. 

To Do Tip Ribbons. — Wash same as 
other colored silks, and if stiffness is 
required, rinse in weak soapsuds con- 
taining a small amount of gum arabic. 
Now roll the ribbon about a glass 
bottle, or wind about a small rolling- 
pin, smoothing carefully, and dry in 
the shade. 

Or smooth them out, face down, 
upon a piece of varnished wood. 
When dry they will require no ironing. 

To Remove "Wrinkles from Silk. — 
Wrinkled or creased ribbons and silks 
may be restored by laying them on a 
smooth surface and sponging them 
evenly with a sponge moistened in a 
weak solution of gum arabic. Smooth 
out while wet on a polished flat sur- 
face of wood, or roll about a rolling- 
pin and dry in the shade. Iron be- 
tween two pieces of cloth, pressing on 
the wrong side with a warm, not hot, 
iron. 

To Store Away Silks. — Do not 
wrap silks in white paper. The chlor- 
ide of lime used to bleach the paper 
will attack the colors of the silk. 

To Iron Flannel and Woolen Goods. 
— Iron flannels and woolens the same 
day they are washed, if possible, and 
before they become quite dry. Take 
from the line when still damp, roll up 
in a dry cloth, and press on the wrong 
side with an iron not too hot. If 
they become dry they should be damp- 
ened slightly by rolling up in a damp 
cloth to await their turn. 

To Iron Blankets — Iron blankets 
before they are quite dry, and air 
thoroughly before storing away. 

TO DO TTP lACES AND CURTAINS 

To Starch laces. — Good lace does 
not require starching. Enough white 
sugar dissolved in the last rinsing 
water to make it slightly sweet should 
give it the required stiffness. 



THE HOME LAUNDRY 



741 



Or boil 4 ounces of rice in 1 quart 
of water until the kernels break up. 
Strain through cheese cloth and dip 
the laces in the clear rice water. 

Or use a thin solution of gum arabic. 

Or mix 1 teaspoonful of cornstarch 
or wheat starch with cold water to the 
consistency of cream, beating and rub- 
bing until all is wet evenly. Dilute 
to consistency of milk with cold water, 
add 5 or 6 drops of gum arabic, and 
thin with boiling water until nearly 
transparent. Boil for 5 or 6 minutes 
until well cooked. T\\e poorer the lace 
the more stiffness will be required. 
Hence do not dilute too much for 
poor laces. 

To Tint Laces. — For an ecru tint 
add black coffee or powdered saffron 
to the rinsing water. Or add tea to 
give a stronger shade. Experiment 
with a small sample of the goods, add- 
ing a little more color at a time until 
the right shade is obtained. 

To Iron Laces. — If laces are basted 
on cloth, and the cloth is thoroughly 
stretched, or if they are carefully 
wound about a bottle and stitched, 
they may not require any ironing. 
Lace wound about a bottle may be 
dipped into very thin starch or gum- 
arabic water without being removed, 
and may not need any ironing. Lace 
handkerchiefs may be pulled into 
shape while wet and carefully laid on 
a pane of glass, wrinkles being all 
smoothed out. When dry they will 
be ready for use. 

Or dry small lace articles between 
two pieces of clean white blotting 
paper under a weight, with or with- 
out ironing. When starch is used, 
do not allow laces to dry, but roll 
them in a dry towel for half an hour 
or more, and press while still damp. 
Iron on the wrong side over a Turk- 
ish towel to bring up the pattern, 
protecting the articles from the iron 
with a piece of muslin or other thin 
white cloth. Use a warm, not hot, 
iron. Ironing pieces while damp 
greatly improves their appearance; 
ironing on a soft, rough surface both 
protects them and brings up the pat- 
tern, and ironing through a thin cloth 
makes it possible to bring out the 



points and pattern of the lace with the 
point of the iron without injury. New 
embroideries should be washed and 
ironed before using. 

To Remove Wrinkles. — If lace be- 
comes dry before ironing, or if it is 
desired to remove the wrinkles from 
clean lace without washing, hold it 
over the steam of the teakettle or a 
basin of steaming water until thor- 
oughly moistened. While damp press 
it under a weight, with or with- 
out blotters, or iron it as above sug- 
gested. 

To Starch Curtains. — Do not use 
much starch for laoe curtains. This 
is a common mistake when curtains 
are done up at home. It is contrary 
to the essential delicacy of lace to 
make it stiff with starch. Moreover, 
the sun will rot lace which contains 
too much starch or other stiffening 
substances. Only the coarsest kind 
of lace can stand stiffening. 

To Do Tip Curtains. — Starch cur- 
tains the same as other laces with a 
thin boiled cornstarch or wheat starch 
containing a solution of gum arabic, 
and stretch them on suitable frames 
or otherwise to dry. If they are 
stretched properly, they will require 
no ironing or they may be pressed 
slightly when drJ^ 

To Iron Curtains.^ Lay the cur- 
tains while still damp on a folded flan- 
nel blanket and press on the wrong 
side with irons as hot as possible with- 
out scorching. This method brings out 
raised figures and designs. 

To Prevent Scorch. — Wipe the iron 
on a cloth wet with kerosene. 

To Remove Scorch. — Ljnen articles 
and other white goods slightly 
scorched by hot irons may be restored, 
if the fibers have not been destroyed, 
simply by exposing them to the heat of 
the sun or, on dark days, to the heat 
from an ojien oven. Moisten them at 
intervals by sponging lightly with clear 
water. If the stains are deeper, rub 
chlorine water into the spot with a 
sponge or linen rag. 
earth. Boil five minutes, cool, and 
pour over the scorched linen. Let it 
dry on, and afterwards remove by 
washing. Repeat if necessary.

SOLVENTS FOR SPOTS AND 
STAINS 

The commonest stains that have to be 
removed from textile fabrics are ink, 
grass green, iron rust, mildew, grease 
spots, paint, and tar. These require 
treatment according to the nature of 
the stain and the fabric. The princi- 
pal chemicals that should be kept on 
hand in the laundry closet to remove 
stains are certain acids, especially 
oxalic, tartaric, and muriatic acid; 
together with ammonia and hyposul- 
phite of soda to neutralize the effect 
of the acid after the stain has been 
removed; aqua ammonia for the same 
purpose; various substances that have 
the power of cutting or dissolving 
gums and resins, as alcohol, chloro- 
form, and oil of turpentine; and cer- 
tain absorbents, as chalk, French 
chalk, pipe clay, fuller's earth, and 
the like. Other useful articles — as 
fresh milk, sour milk, buttermilk, 
cream of tartar, lemon juice, salt, 
raw potato, etc., will usually be at 
hand. 

Treatment of Spots and Stains. — 
Treatment for stains in general should 
be progressive, beginning with the 
milder remedies and reserving the 
more powerful ones to the last. 
Fresh stains are much more easily 



742 



soluble than those that are allowed to 
remain until various chemical changes 
have taken place. Hence prompt 
treatment is always advisable. When 
stains are fresh, immediate applica- 
tion of any dry absorbent powder, as 
common salt, common starch, chalk, 
pipe clay, etc., will take up much of 
the staining fluid. Dipping at once 
into boiling water for some stains 
and into milk for others will assist in 
dissolving the stain, and various other 
agents may then be applied while the 
fabric is wet. If the stains have been 
suffered to dry they must usually be 
wet by soaking to swell the fibers of 
the fabric, so as to allow the cleansing 
substance to be absorbed. 

The Laundry Closet. — It will be 
found very convenient to provide a 
special receptacle in the kitchen or 
laundry for the various articles for 
removing stains, and for the soaps, 
washing compounds, bluing, starch, 
and other things used in the laundry. 
A complete list will include hard bar 
soap, both white and yellow, naplitlia 
soap, sal soda, bluing, wheat and corn 
starch, borax, aqua ammonia, sugar 
of lead, oxalic, muriatic, and tartaric 
acids, bleaching powder (chloride of 
lime), caustic potash, turpentine, ben- 
zine, and gasoline, besides various 
cleansing mixtures. This closet should 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS 



743 



have a strong lock or padlock, and 
the key should be kept beyond the 
reach of children. Every bottle and 
package of poisonous substances 
should be plainly labeled and should 
bear the word " Poison." 

Utensils for Stains or Spots. — The 
laundry closet should also contain a 
number of small sponges, which can 
be bought for ten cents a dozen, for 
applying various substances to stained 
fabrics; likewise several sizes of small 
camel's-hair paint brushes, such as 
are used for water colors. The stiff 
fibrous sj^onges called " loofah," which 
cost about ten cents apiece, are es- 
pecially useful for grease stains or 
spots. If the goods is rough these 
can be used to scrape with vigorously. 
They can also be used with a lighter 
touch on delicate fabrics. They leave 
no lint and are easily washed and 
dried. When removing spots or 
stains, first hold the garment to the 
light, and if the stain is on the sur- 
face scrape off as much of it as pos- 
sible with a sharp knife before wet- 
ting the fabric or applying chemicals. 

Acids to Remove Stains. — The 
laundry cupboard should be furnished 
with a 4- or 6-ounce vial of oxalic 
and of tartaric acid and a 2-ounce 
vial of muriatic acid. These will be 
found easy to apply, and prove much 
more effective than many of the or- 
dinary methods that often must be 
employed if they are not kept at 
hand. 

Cautions in Use of Acids. — These 
acids are all poisonous and must be 
labeled " Poison," and locked up out 
of the reach of children. They must 
not be used on colored fabrics, and 
must be quickly and thoroughly rinsed 
out as soon as the stain has been re- 
moved. When possible, they should 
be followed by the use of hyposul- 
phite of soda, ammonia, or other 
chemical that will neutralize the acid. 

Oxalic Acid. — This is the active 
principle of salts of sorrel. When 
combined with cream of tartar it is 
known as salts of lemon. It may be 
dissolved in one part of boiling water. 
It is a dangerous poison, and in cer- 
tain quantities will cause death in 
about ten minutes. It is used for 



cleaning leather, scouring metals, es- 
pecially brass and copper, and for re- 
moving various stains. It has very 
much the appearance of Epsom salts, 
from which it must be carefully dis- 
tinguished. 

Use of Oxalic Acid. — Oxalic acid is 
especially useful in the laundry to re- 
move iron mold, fruit stains, and ink 
spots produced by the old style iron- 
gall inks. It does not, however, re- 
move ink stains produced by modern 
writing fluids or blue-black inks com- 
posed of aniline dyes. Oxalic acid 
may be applied to cotton, linen, wool- 
en, silk, or any ordinary fabric if un- 
colored, but it bleaches colored goods. 
The color, can, however, in most cases 
be restored by aqua ammonia. When 
possible, it is advisable to experiment 
with a sample of the goods before ap- 
plying oxalic acid to colored articles. 

To Apply Oxalic Acid. — The acid 
may be applied alone, either dissolved 
in its own bulk of boiling water for a 
" saturated " solution, or in nine parts 
of cold water for a *' dilute " solution. 

Or, as salts of lemon, it may be dis- 
solved in 1 to 10 parts of water, either 
hot or cold. The action of the acid 
is increased by heat as in boiling 
water. 

To apply, either wet the spot in 
water and cover with a dry oxalic acid 
or salts of lemon, or dip the spot into 
the solution, or apply the solution to 
the spot with a small brush, sponge, 
or piece of rag. If the stains are old 
or have penetrated through the fabric 
it will be necessary to rub the acid 
vigorously into the spot and persist 
patiently until successful. Oxalic acid 
is also recommended to bleach silk in 
the proportion of 4 pounds of the 
acid and 4 pounds of salt to 2 quarts 
of water for the raw silk, or 2 ounces 
of oxalic acid and 2 ounces of salt to 
6 quarts of water for white silk that 
has become yellowed from washing. 
The latter proportions may be ob- 
serv^ed for removing vegetable or fruit 
stains, should it be necessary to im- 
merse the article in the solution. 

As soon as the stain disappears, 
rinse with clear water, and after- 
wards wash with soapsuds. 

Uses of Citric Acid. — This is the 



744 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



acid jirincijile of alum and lemon 
juice; it is also found in gooseberries, 
currants, and some otlicr fruits. It 
is intensely sour, is readily soluble in 
water, and is used in medicine; in 
dyeing, to heighten certain colors; and 
to break up certain coloring com- 
pounds. Citric acid may be used dis- 
solved in slightly more than its own 
bulk of water for a saturated solu- 
tion, or in 10 or more parts for a 
dilute solution. It may be applied 
to white goods or fast-dyed cotton or 
woolen, by moistening the stain with 
a solution by means of the fmger tips, 
a small brush, sponge, or rag. Rinse 
immediately in clear water. It may 
be used for stains from fruit, iron- 
gall inks, iron rust, or mildew; but 
for these oxalic or tartaric acids are 
commonly preferred. In the form of 
lemon juice, citric acid is a mild but 
useful agent, and one generally em- 
ployed. With the addition of salt on 
colored goods it may safely be used 
on any ordinary fabric. To apply, 
saturate the spot with lemon juice, 
and for colored goods cover with dry 
salt. Exjiose to direct sunshine and 
repeat if necessary. 

Or apply lemon juice and salt, and 
steam the fabric over a kettle. 

Uses of Lactic Acid. — This is the 
acid which forms in milk when it 
turns sour and which is, therefore, 
contained in buttermilk. It is the 
presence of this acid which causes 
buttermilk to be employed in the proc- 
ess of bleaching linen. Sweet milk, 
sour milk, and buttermilk are all 
recommended for the treatment of 
stains in fabrics, the action being 
strong in proportion as the liquid 
sours with age. Hence, when stains 
are fresh they may be removed by 
dipping immediately in warm milk; 
but wTien they are more stubborn, 
they may require soaking in butter- 
milk for some time. The addition of 
common salt increases their effective- 
ness. This is a simple and useful 
means of treating ink stains from 
iron-gall inks, tea stains, red-wine 
stains, and fruit stains, especially 
when fresh. Sour buttermilk also 
erases mildew. Wet or soak the arti- 
cle in fresh or sour milk or butter- 



milk, cover with common salt — which 
contains chlorine, a powerful bleach- 
ing agent — and expose to sunshine in 
the open air. 

Nature of Tartaric Acid. — This is 
the acid principle of cream of tartar 
and is found in a free state in vari- 
ous plants and fruits, especially the 
grape. It is readily soluble in either 
alcohol or water. If dissolved in 
water and allowed to stand it deteri- 
orates, turning into acetic acid. It is 
the acid principle of Rochelle salts 
and is principally used in dyeing, in 
preparing effervescing beverages, and 
as an ingredient in baking powder. In 
medicine it is used as tartar emetic. 

Tartaric acid is but slightly poison- 
ous, is much less destructive to cloth 
fibers than are other acids, and does 
not injure fast colors. It may be 
dissolved in less than its own bulk of 
water, and hence may be used in a 
very strong solution and readily 
washed out of the most delicate 
fabrics. 

Uses of Tartaric Acid. — Tartaric 
acid is especially useful in grass 
stains, as it changes the chlorophyll 
and chlorophyllan into soluble sub- 
stances. It is nearly as effective as 
oxalic acid on ink spots from iron- 
gall inks. It may be used on all or- 
dinary linen, silk, cotton, woolen, or 
other fabrics, and if combined with 
salt will not cause the colors to run. 
The usefulness of this article in the 
laundry does not seem to be generally 
known. 

To Apply Tartaric Acid. — Wet the 
spot with water and ap]ily the dry 
acid with or without an equal quan- 
tity of salt. 

Or wet the spot and cover with 
cream of tartar, with or without its 
bulk of salt. The process will be 
quickened if the stain is held over the 
steam of a teakettle or laid upon a 
heated dinner plate or other smooth, 
heated surface. The acid may be 
rubbed into white goods with the fin- 
ger tips or the bowl of a spoon, but 
on colored goods it should be applied 
more carefully. 

Or, for a "saturated solution, dis- 
solve in its own bulk or less of hot 
water. For a dilute solution dissolve 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS 



745 



in 10 or more parts of cold water. 
Apply same as oxalic acid. 

Nature of Salts of Lemon. — This 
is a compound of equal parts in bulk 
of cream of tartar and salts of sor- 
rel. It combines the effects of tar- 
taric and oxalic acids. Its uses and 
methods of application are similar. 
It may be used on the same fabrics 
and requires similar caution. 

Nature and Uses of Muriatic Acid. 
— This is a gas produced by treat- 
ing common salt with sulphuric acid 
or oil of vitriol. It is readily soluble 
in water, and this solution is the 
commercial article. It is poisonous, 
has a sharp keen smell and taste, and 
when inhaled causes suffocation. One 
part of water will absorb about 450 
times its own bulk of the gas. It is 
a powerful corrosive, and must be 
provided with a glass or rubber stop- 
per, or the cork must be smeared 
with vaseline, else it will eat the cork 
and evaporate. It corrodes metals. 

To Apply Muriatic Acid. — This 
acid is especially useful to remove red 
rust stains. To apply, lay the fabric 
containing the spot over an earthen 
dish of boiling water. Allow a drop 
of the acid to fall on the stain from 
a glass stopper or medicine dropper. 
This will cause the stain to fade to a 
light yellow. Drop the cloth immedi- 
ately into the water and rinse. Re- 
peat if necessary. As soon as the 
stain disappears, rinse the article and 
dip it into ammonia water. This will 
neutralize any acid that was not re- 
moved by rinsing. 

Muriatic acid may be used on linen 
or cotton fabrics, but not on silks or 
woolens. It can be employed on cer- 
tain fast colors, but it is advisable to 
test a sample of the goods before ap- 
plying. 

Nature and Uses ef Annaonia. — It 
is interesting to note that the name 
" ammonia " was formerly applied to 
common salt on account of the fact 
that salt was anciently found in the 
Libyan Desert near the Temple of 
Jupiter Amnion. Ammonia occurs as 
a colorless transparent gas with a 
pungent odor. It is readily soluble 
in water, 1 part of water absorbing 
about 500 volumes of the gas. A so- 



lution of ammonia in water is called 
aqua ammonia or " spirits of Harts- 
horn." Preparations sold for house- 
hold purposes vary greatly in strength. 
Smelling salts or sal volatile is a car- 
bonate of ammonia. Ammonia com- 
bines with acids to form soluble salts. 
Hence it is useful in removing fruit 
stains and other acids. It may be 
applied freely to all ordinary fabrics; 
to remove stains made by strong acids, 
red wine, iodine, nitrate of silver, and 
also the stains of sea water and cod- 
liver oil. 

Uses of Alcohol. — Alcohol, as is 
well known, is a pure, colorless liquid 
with a burning taste. It burns easily, 
has a strong affinity for water, and 
dissolves many substances. Pure al- 
cohol is called absolute or " anhj--- 
drous" alcohol, but the commercial 
article varies from "proof spirits," 
which contains about 50 per cent of 
alcohol by volume, to " cologne spir- 
its," which contains from 93 to 95 per 
cent. 

The solvent quality of alcohol makes 
it useful to remove stains in silk, 
woolen, and other delicate fabrics, 
provided they are soluble and do not 
require chemical treatment. It may 
be mixed with benzine or aqua am- 
monia or both. It is most effective 
when the stains are fresh. 

Uses of Chloroform. — Chloroform 
is a colorless liquid \\ith a sweetish 
taste and characteristic odor. Its 
anesthetic properties are well known. 
It is slightly soluble in water, but 
readily so in alcohol and ether. It 
has the property of dissolving cam- 
phor, resin, wax, rubber, iodine, and 
other substances. Chloroform may be 
employed to restore certain colors 
that were removed by acids after the 
acids have been destroyed by the ap- 
plication of ammonia. 

Uses of Turpentine. — Turpentine is 
a resinous oil obtained from cone- 
bearing trees. The commercial arti- 
cle is a solution of resin in a volatile 
oil. Turpentine has a well-known 
spicy odor, a bitter taste, and burns 
freely- Oil of turpentine, obtained by 
distillation, is a colorless liquid with 
a peculiar odor; it is insoluble in wa- 
ter, but dissolves readily in alcohol or 



746 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



ether. It also dissolves resin, gummy 
substances, oils, rubber, iodine, sul- 
phur, and phosphorus. Hence its use- 
fulness in treating stains producetl by 
such substances. 'ITie commercial ar- 
ticle is sold in various grades, and is 
used extensively in the preparation of 
paints and varnishes. 

To Apply Turpentine. — Turpentine 
will remove paint, grease, or vaseline 
stains without injury to the most deli- 
cate fabric. Apply sufficient turpen- 
tine to soak the paint or grease spot. 
Use a camel's-hair brush, a common 
pen or feather, or, for large spots, a 
sponge. 

Or apply by dropping from a glass 
bottle. 

The turpentine may be mixed with 
alcohol, salts of lemon, or sulphuric 
ether. 

Kinds and Uses of Absorbents. — 
Various absorbents are recommended 
to remove grease, wax, blood, ink, 
mildew, and other stains from fab- 
rics. Among the most useful of these 
are brown paper and blotting paper. 
Others are chalk, French chalk (which 
is not chalk but ground soapstone), 
pipe clay, fuller's earth, magnesia, 
gypsum, common starch, and melted 
tallow. 

One of the quickest and best meth- 
ods to remove grease (especially when 
it is fresh) and spots of wax is to 
lay over the spot a piece of common 
brown paper and press with a hot 
iron. Care must be taken not to use 
an iron hot enough to change the 
colors of colored silks and print 
goods. If convenient the spot may 
be previously covered with French 
chalk. 

Or any of the above powders may 
be applied dry. The grease or wax 
will be taken up more quickly if held 
near a stove or pressed with a hot 
iron. 

For mildew, rub the spots with wet 
soap, rub in pipe clay, fuller's earth, 
or chalk, cover thickly with the same, 
and expose to sunshine. 

For blood stains use cornstarch. 

Chlorine and Uses of Bleaching 
Powder. — This is the chlori<lo of lime 
prepared by exposing damp slacked 
lime to chlorine gas. A good, fresh 



article contains 25 to 30 per cent of 
effective chlorine, which is a power- 
ful bleaching agent. It decomposes 
and deteriorates with time, setting 
free hydrochloric acid, to which the 
bleaching is due. This is a pale-yel~ 
low gas that has the property 
of decomposing various kinds of col- 
oring matter. Bleaching powder is 
one of the surest agents for removing 
ink stains or writing from white tex- 
tile fabric or paper. Cover the spots 
with dry bleaching powder and mois- 
ten with a weak mineral acid, as acetic 
or tartaric acid. This method is not 
suitable for colored goods, as the 
bleaching powder would remove the 
colors. Afterwards neutralize the acid 
by applying aqua ammonia or hypo- 
sulphite of soda. 

To Make and Use Javelle Water. — 
Chloride of lime or Javelle water is a 
colorless liquid that may be prepared 
from bleaching powder. It is much 
used for taking fruit and other stains 
from white textile fabrics and for 
bleaching wood and straw. For fruit 
stains dissolve A pound of chloride of 
lime in 2 quarts of cold water. Dis- 
solve separately in an agate pan 1 
pound of sal soda in one quart of boil- 
ing water. Mix the two solutions, let 
the mixture settle, and pour off the 
clear liquid. This is Javelle water. 
Apply with a brush, rinse in clear 
water, and dip in ammonia water to 
neutralize the acid. 

Or dissolve 2 ounces of chloride of 
lime in 1 quart of boiling water. Im- 
merse the fabric in this for 5 min- 
utes. Remove, add i quarts of cold 
water, and soak the article for 3 to 
12 hours, depending upon the 
strength of the fabric. This is heroic 
treatment, and should only be used 
on coarser articles, as duck, canvas, 
and the like, as it tends to rot the 
fabric. Afterwards immerse in a so- 
lution of 4 ounces of hyposulphite of 
soda to I gallon of water to neutralize 
the acid. Rinse in clear water and 
wash in soapsuds. 

Nature of Gasoline. — Gasoline is a 
product of the distillation of petro- 
leum. The first liquid that passes 
over in the distillation of petroleum 
is crude naphtha. By redistillation 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS 



747 



this is separated into gasoline and 
the A, B, and C grades of naphtha. 
Gasoline is very commonly used for 
domestic heating and cooking in 
stoves especially jjrepared for the pur- 
pose, and also in gasoline engines for 
the production of power. It is 
highly inflammable and explosive. It 
gives off under ordinary temperature 
a volatile gas which, by contact with 
flame, or a hot stove, will ignite at a 
distance of several feet from the liq- 
uid gasoline. Great caution must, 
therefore, be exercised in its use. 

Benzine is a substance similar to 
gasoline, and may be used for spong- 
ing fabrics in the same manner. 

How to Use Gasoline. — Employed 
by the following methods gasoline 
will thoroughly cleanse wool, silk, vel- 
vet, and other fabrics of animal fibers, 
but not cotton, and will remove 
grease, paint, wax, and mud stains; 
in fact, practically all stains except 
acid ones, without injury to the tex- 
ture or colors of the fabric. Dirt and 
other impurities removed wall sink to 
the bottom and can be removed by 
straining through cheese cloth. Hence 
the same gasoline may be used again 
and again. The best results are ob- 
tained by using a fairly large quan- 
tity of gasoline and soaking and 
washing the articles in it the same as 
in water. The cost of cleaning with 
gasoline is much less than is charged 
by a professional cleaner, and a great 
deal less than that of replacing the ar- 
ticles. Hence it pays to purchase the 
best gasoline in five-gallon cans, and 
to provide and set aside two or three 
covered earthenware jars in which to 
use it. 

Cleaning with gasoline should be 
done preferably out of doors, or if 
indoors, by daylight, and never in the 
vicinity of a hot stove, lamp, or other 
flame. Care must be taken that 
matches are not accidentally lighted 
in its vicinity. 

First, shake and brush the articles 
to remove dust and dirt. Remove 
rubber dress shields or other pieces of 
rubber, as they will be spoiled. Tack 
small articles together and wash 
larger ones singly in an earthenware 
jar filled with gasoline and allow them 



to soak for an hour or more. If the 
jar can be put in a pan which is sur- 
rounded with hot water (but not on 
a stove or near any open flame), the 
gasoline will do its work quicker and 
better and will be less disagreeable 
for the hands. The addition of com- 
mon salt at the rate of a teaspoonful 
to each quart will prevent leaving a 
ring, and a few drops of oil of sassa- 
fras will neutralize the unpleasant

Doors " 

odor. After soaking, work the arti- 
cles about, rubbing carefully between 
the fingers, or rub the spots with a 
toothbrush or nailbrush having fairly 
soft bristles. Or dip the brush into a 
small can of gasoline set into a pan of 
hot water. Squeeze the gasoline out 
of the garments and put them into a 
second jar, into which pour fresh 
gasoline, meantime putting other ar- 
ticles to soak in the first jar. A third 
jar may be used if necessary. After 
rinsing in the second or tliird jar 
squeeze the garments quite dry, stretch 
carefully to their proper shape, and 
thoroughly evaporate liy airing them 
on a line, and afterwards pressing 
them with a hot iron. Hang coats or 



748 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



waists on a coat hanger to keep in 
shape while drying. 

Pour the gasoline back into the can 
through a funnel covered with several 
thicknesses of cheese cloth. 

Or, to remove a spot or a stain, 
stretch the fabric over a piece of blot- 
ting paper and pour the gasoline 
around it. Sponge inwardly toward 
the spot as a center until it is removed. 
Take a dry cloth and continue rub- 
bing in the same manner with light 
strokes until the article is dry. 

Or sprinkle a little i)owdered gyp- 
sum over the spot, extending beyond 
the moistened part. When this is 
brushed off, the spot will be removed. 
Or, if a benzine stain, rub French 
chalk into it with a piece of flannel, 
sprinkle a layer of the chalk over it, 
and let stand for twenty-four hours. 
Cleansing Mixtures. — Shave 4 
ounces of Castile or other hard white 
soap and dissolve in 2 quarts of boil- 
ing water. Remove from the fire, and 
when cold add i/g ounce of saltpeter, 
stirring until ~ dissolved. Strain 
through cheese cloth, let the mixture 
settle, and take off the scum with a 
skimmer. Now add y^ pint of am- 
monia and bottle and cork tightly. 
Keep in an earthenware jug with a 
tight cork. This is the so-called 
"Magic Annihilator,'' which is recom- 
mended to remove grease and oil 
from all kinds of dress goods and 
other fabrics without injuring them, 
and for various other purposes, as 
scouring floors, cleaning windows, 
metals, etc. It must not be used on 
woodenware, as it will remove paint, 
for which purpose it is especially 
recommended. 

Pour this liquid on both sides of 
the spot or article to be cleaned. 
Scrub with a stiff brush, sponge, or 
loof, and rinse with cold water. Re- 
peat if necessary. To clean silverware 
and other metals mix with whiting. 

Chemical Soap. — Shave 1 ounce 
of Castile soap, cover with 1 pint of 
water, and boil until dissolved. Stir 
in 2 ounces of sal soda, 14 ounce of 
starch, i/4 ounce of borax. Pour into 
molds to cool and harden. Apply 
with a rag, sponge, or loofah to re- 
move grease, paint, tar, etc. 



Or mix '/a ounce of borax and y^ 
ounce of camphor in a quart fruit jar. 
Pour over them 1 pint of boiling wa- 
ter. Cork tightly and let stand im- 
til cool. Now acid y, pint of alcohol, 
shake well, and cork tightly. Use to 
sponge woolen dress goods, men's 
clothing, felt hats, and tlie like. 

Or dissolve 1 ounce of Castile soap 
scrai)ed in 1 quart of boiling water. 
Let cool and add y^ ounce of glycerin, 
1/^ ounce of alcohol, and y^ ounce of 
sulphuric ether. Bottle, co~rk tightly, 
and keeji in a dark place. Use to 
sponge all sorts of dress goods, and 
especially to remove grease spots. 

Or mix equal parts of turpentine, 
benzine, and chloroform. 

Scouring Mixtures. — INIix 3 pounds 
of fuller's earth, y, pound of pipe clay, 
2 ounces of powdered French chalk. 
Mix separately 1 ounce of rectified 
spirits of tur])entine, 1 ounce of alco- 
hol, and 12 ounces of soap jelly. Stir 
the two mixtures together to a stiff 
paste and place in tightly covered 
fruit jars. 

Or mix equal parts of fuller's earth 
and soap jelly. To apply, moisten 
the cloth with warm water and cover 
with this mixture, rubbing it well 
into the goods. Let stand until dry, 
then scour with a stiff brush and warm 
water. 

Or mix 1 ounce of baking sode^ 1 
ounce of prepared chalk, 1 ounce of 
pumice stone, and 1 ounce of sifted 
wood ashes. Apply this mixture with 
a piece of raw white potato. 

Nature of the Fabric. — The treat- 
ment of spots and stains depends not 




"With Animal Fibers Caution i.i 
Necessary " 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS 



749 



only upon the kind of stain, but also 
upon the nature of the fabric. Fab- 
rics are of two principal classes : vege- 
table fibers, which include linen and 
cotton goods; and animal fibers, which 
include wool, silk, furs, feathers, and 
the like. All vegetable fibers contain 
cellulose, a hard, woodlike substance 
that offers a strong resistance to the 
action of chemical agents, and is not 
easily injured by rubbing. Hence 
stronger acids and alkalies and more 
vigorous rubbing can be emjiloyed 
upon cottons and linens than upon 
wool, silk, or other animal fibers. 

In the treatment of wool, caution is 
necessary from the fact that the fibers 
of wool have numerous minute hook- 
like projections which, by rubbing the 
fibers together, or by alternate expan- 




" All Vegetable Fibers Contain 
Cellulose." 

sion and contraction (as when plunged 
from hot water to cold water, and 
back again), become interlaced in 
such a way as to warp fabric in all 
directions. This is what causes the 
shrinking of woolen goods, so much 
dreaded by the laundress. Hence 
wool should not be rubbed or wrung 
out in the usual way, nor subjected 
to either very hot or very cold water. 
The water should be lukewarm or not 
too warm to bear the hands comfort- 
ably, and all washing and rinsing wa- 
ters should be kept at a nearly uni- 
form temperature. 

A similar caution in handling silk 
is due to the delicacy of the fabric. 
Silk, if rulibed or wrung out, tends 
to crack or to show permanent wrin- 
gles. It should accordingly be han- 
dled with care, and only the finer 



grades of soap should be employed 
in cleaning it. 

KINDS OF SPOTS AND STAINS 

The principal stains and spots the 
laundress has to do with are tea, cof- 
fee, and wine stains, iron rust, and 
ink; paint and tar, grass stains and 
mildew, blood stains, grease spots, 
and mud stains. These should all be 
removed from washable articles be- 
fore sending them to the laundry. 
Hence many housekeepers set apart 
Tuesdaj^ for wash day, and take oc- 
casion Monday to sort the wash and 
carefully remove all stains, and sponge 
or scrub or dry-clean any articles that 
may require it. 

Grass Stains. — White and other 
light-colored summer gowns, duck 
and flannel trousers, and children's 
garments frequently show grass stains 
in summer. The green stain is pro- 
duced by chlorophyll, a coloring mat- 
ter present in growing vegetation. 
This, when exposed to the action of 
the air, becomes changed into chloro- 
phyllan, which is insoluble in water. 
Grass stains when fresh may be re- 
moved by sponging with alcohol, but 
after the chlorophyll has been con- 
verted into chlorophjilan, the action 
of alcohol will leave an insoluble 
brown stain in place of the green. 
Neither oxalic nor muriatic acid is ef- 
fective with grass stains, but a hot so- 
lution of tartaric acid changes the 
green stain to light brown, that yields 
readily to boiling soapsuds in the 
laundry. If tartaric acid is not at 
hand, wet the stain and apply cream 
of tartar or salts of lemon. 

Or dissolve cream of tartar in boil- 
ing water and apply hot. 

Or rub grass stains with molasses 
and wash in clear, soft water without 
soap. Do not use oxalic or muriatic 
acid. 

Or ammonia and water may be 
used, if the colors are not delicate. 

Tea and Coffee Stains. — These, 
when fresh, all yield readily to the 
action of boiling water, especially if 
the fabric be stretched tightly and 
the boiling water poured upon it with 
some force.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



To prevent scalding the hands when 
pouring hot water over table linen 
in order to remove the stains, stretch 
the stained portion over a deep bowl 
or basin and use clothes pins to hold 
it firmly in place. Tlien it becomes 
an easy matter to pour on the boiling 
water. 

The stains will yield to treatment 
more readily if first soaked in cold 
borax water. 

If stains have been neglected and 
fixed by soap in the laundry, it may 
be necessary to api>ly dilute oxalic 
acid or chloride of lime, or to treat 
them with lemon juice and salt, salts 
of lemon, and other remedies, after- 
wards exposing the article to the air 
and sunshine. The stains of berries, 
especially of blackberries, and of 
plums and peaches are very refractory. 
Hence, if possible, these should have 
immediate treatment. 

Paint. — Paint and resin may be 
quickly dissolved by the action of 
turpentine, benzine, chloroform, or 
sulphurous ether, the treatment de- 
pending upon the nature of the fab- 
ric. Tar maj'^ be rubbed with lard and 
afterwards removed by washing. Oils 
may be dissolved by alcohol, ether, or 
spirits of turpentine. For colored 
goods, these may all be combined with 
ammonia and glycerin. 

Mildew. — Mildew is a fungous 
growth of certain parasitic plants. 
It forms on cloth that is exposed to 
dampness in patches of various col- 
ors, red, black, yellow, or even green. 
Various substances may be used to 
prevent its forming. Mildew pro- 
duces a stain which is very refrac- 
tory. The treatment depends u])on 
the nature of the fabric and the ex- 
tent and depth of the stain, and varies 
from simple remedies, such as soap, 
lemon juice and salt, and the like, to 
chloride of lime and the more power- 
ful acids. Other sul:)stances recom- 
mended are French chalk, starch, and 
buttermilk. The.se must, of course, 
be used with proper caution and a 
due regard to the liability of injury 
to the fabric. They should be after- 
wards assisted by the bleaching agen- 
cies of air and sunshine. 

To Prevent Mildew. — Canvas, duck. 



and similar fabrics used for awnings, 
tents, and the like may be preserved 
against mildew by first soaking them 
in strong suds made by dissolving »/, 
pound of hard white or yellow soap 
in 2 gallons of water, and afterwards 
immersing the fabric, for a period of 
2i hours, in a solution of 1 pound of 
alum dissolved in 1 gallon of water. 

To Remove Mildew. — Dissolve 1 
ounce of chloride of lime in 1 pint of 
boiling water; then add 3 pints of cold 
water. Soak the article in this 
from .3 to \2 hours. Remove, rin.se 
thoroughly, and send to the laundry. 
If the chloride of lime is not thorough- 
ly washed out the fabric may be in- 
jured. 

Or rub the spot with good yellow 
soap, wash, and while wet rub jmw- 
dered chalk into it and cover with a 
layer of chalk. Lay the article on the 
grass in the sun and sprinkle clear wa- 
ter over it. Repeat this treatment un- 
til the mildew is removed. 

Or wet the spots in a solution of one 
half peroxide of hydrogen and one 
half water. Hang out to drip dry, or 
lay on grass to bleach. Repeat, if 
necessary. 

Or mix ^ pound of soap jelly with 
2 ounces of starch, 1 ounce of salt, 
and the juice of 1 lemon. Pour over 
the stain, or apply with a brush. 

Or saturate the spots with lemon 
juice and salt and expose to direct 
sunlight. 

Iron Rust. — Stains from iron rust 
(or " iron mold," as they are some- 
times called) yield readily to both 
muriatic acid and oxalic acid, but as 
the latter is less injurious to fabrics, 
a hot solution of it gives most satis- 
faction. Other substances recom- 
mended to remove iron rust are salts 
of lemon, lemon juice, salt, cream of 
tartar, and various admixtures of 
these. 

Spread the stained fabric over a 
bowl containing 1 teaspoonful of borax 
dissolved in 1 quart of water. Apply 
dilute muriatic or oxalic acid, drop by 
drop, until the stain fades. Then dip 
the fabric into the borax water. Re- 
peat if necessary. 

Or wet the stained fabric, apply the 
cleansing substance and hold in the 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS

steam of a teakettle, or expose to di- 
rect sunshine, spreading on the grass 
when convenient until the stain is re- 
moved. Repeat the treatment as often 
as is necessary. 

To make salts of lemon, mix equal 
parts of cream of tartar and pow- 
dered salt of sorrel. Wet the spot, 
and apply dry salts to the wet sur- 
face. 

Or mix lemon juice with salt and 
cover thickly. 

Or use equal parts of cream of tar- 
tar and oxalic acid, or equal parts of 
cream of tartar and salt. 

To Remove Whitewash. — To re- 
move whitewash stains apply strong 
vinegar. 

Vaseline Stains. — Wash in v^arm 
soapsuds, rinse, and apply chlorinated 
soda. 

Or soak in kerosene and wash in 
strong soap suds. 

To Remove Tomato Stains. — Soak 
the parts stained (before washing) in 
sour milk. 

Wax Stains. — Apply alcohol or 
naphtha with a camel's-hair brush, 
sponge, or piece of rag. 

Or hold the stains within an inch 
or two of a very hot iron, and rub 
with a soft, clean rag. 

Or lay over them a piece of coarse 
brown paper, or blotting paper and 
iron with a hot iron. -V 

Paint Stains. — Rub with benzine or 
turpentine; or for delicate goods and 
colors use, instead, chloroform or 
naphtha. 

Or saturate the stains with gaso- 
line and rub with a small sponge or 
flannel rag. Continue until the paint 
is absorbed, and rub with a clean cloth 
until dry. 

Or saturate the spot for some hours 
with turpentine, and afterwards rub 
the article between the hands, when the 
paint will crumble and can be dusted 
away without injury to the fabric. 

To Remove Tar from washable ma- 
terials, rub fresh lard on it, and allow 
it to stand about two or three hours. 
Then wash with hot water and soap. 

To Remove Sticky Fly Paper from 
clothing or other articles rub with 
fresh lard. Then wash with soap and 
water. 



Iodine Stains. — As iodine is often 
applied externally to the skin, it fre- 
quently stains cotton and linen gar- 
ments. To prevent this add a few 
drops of liquid carbolic acid to the 
iodine. 

To remove the stains when fresh, 
dip the spots in aqua ammonia diluted 
with warm water. 

Or cook starch as for the laundry 
and while hot dip the stain into it and 
rub between the hands or on a board 
until it disappears. This process will 
remove stains of most other drugs and 
medicines. 

Or soak the stains in a strong solu- 
tion of hyposulphite of soda and wa- 
ter. 

Or wet the fabric and cover with 
hyposulphite of soda until the stains 
are removed. 

Nutgall Inks. — Formerly black ink 
was usually made of green vitriol dis- 
solved in an infusion of gallnuts. 
Inks of this sort stain paper perma- 
nently and speedily, rapidly darken 
for a while, but eventually become 
yellow or brown with age. These old- 
fashioned inks were easily removed 
with oxalic and mineral acids, but the 
modern inks contain, in addition to 
tannate of iron (produced by the ac- 
tion of nutgalls upon copperas), ani- 
line blue, indigo, and other dye stuffs 
that are not removable by these acids. 
The first inks of this sort were placed 
upon the market about the middle of 
the nineteenth century. Manj^ of the 
recipes still found in print claiming 
to remove all sorts of ink spots were 
originally published more than fifty 
years ago. All such recipes must be 
regarded with suspicion. No single 
recipe can be given that will remove 
stains made by every kind of ink. 

Chrome-logwood Ink. — Another 
modern ink known as the chrome-log- 
wood ink is produced by the action of 
a solution of logwood upon potassium 
chromate. This is a deep purple ink, 
that turns darker after being exposed 
to the air, and has the advantage over 
iron-gall inks that it will not fade. 
Logwood is also combined with an ex- 
tract of alum or chloride of aluminum. 
The best French copying inks are of 
this class. These inks may be removed 



762 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



by muriatic acid, which flrst turns the 
spot red. This acid must not, how- 
ever, be used on stylographic inks con- 
taining eosin or nigrosine, as it will 
turn them into an indelible dye. 

Stylographic Ink. — This is a mod- 
ern ink made by dissolving in water 
the coal-tar product known as nigro- 
sine. It is used for stylographic pens 
on account of its fluidity, as it con- 
tains no sediment. This ink is of a 
deep blue-black color that does not 
change on exposure to the air and 
has little luster. It does not fade, 
and after a lapse of years is soluble 
in water. Hence if paper containing 
it is wet the color will run. The ef- 
fect upon a nigrosine ink of acids in 
certain recipes " guaranteed to re- 
move any ink spot " is to mordant or 
set the ink, rendering it insoluble and 
practically indelible. Hence it is al- 
ways advisable to moisten an ink spot 
with water, and if it blurs or smirches, 
thus indicating the presence of iji- 
grosine, washing soda, caustic soda, 
potash lye, or any other alkali should 
be used, but not an acid. 

Indelible Ink. — Indelible writing 
and marking inks are mostly finely 
divided carbon which, as is well 
known, offers great resistance to chem- 
ical agents. India and China inks are 
of this class. They are composed of 
carbon, chiefly lampblack or other soot, 
mixed with gum or glue. Indelible ink 
for marking textile fabrics is also made 
of nitrate of silver and other silver 
salts. 

Various other substances are em- 
ployed in ink making, but those we 
have given are the most common. 

Treatment of Ink Stains. — If the 
nature of an ink is known, the proper 
treatment can, of course, be given; 
otherwise it is best to first dip the 
ink in water to test if nigrosine is pres- 
ent. 

If nigrosine is not present try oxalic 
acid, which will remove an old style 
iron-gall ink or decompose a modern 
iron-gall ink by removing the black 
tannate of iron, and leaving the in- 
digo and aniline blue dye stuffs as a 
stain on the fabric. Wet the stain in 
cold water and drop dilute oxalic acid, 
or equal parts of oxalic acid and cream 



of tartar on the spot. Let stand a few 
minutes and rinse in ammonia water. 
If this is not eflFective, try muriatic 
acid. This will remove the stain of a 
logwood or copying ink. Follow this 
with an alliali to remove the effects of 
the acid. 

A nitrate of silver ink stain may be 
removed with cyanide of potassium, 
which is a deadly poison. 

Or apply a dilute solution of per- 
manganate of })otash with muriatic 
acid; follow by soaking in a solution 
of hyposulphite of soda, and after- 
wards rinse in clear water. 

If all else fails, cover the spot with 
dry bleaching powder and moisten 
with dilute acetic acid or strong 
vinegar. Afterwards apply ammonia, 
or dip in a solution of hyposulphite of 
soda and rinse. It must be borne in 
mind that strong acids and alkalies 
will injure the texture of animal fibers 
as wool and silk and bleach colored fa- 
brics. For such articles use pyrophos- 
phate of soda. 

If a garment spotted with ink is 
especially valuable it would be well 
to try a series of experiments with 
the same ink on a piece of similar 
fabric. In the meantime cover the 
stain with various dry absorbents to 
take up the excess of ink. After 
these have done their work, soak the 
article in sweet or sour milk while the 
experiments are being made. 

Or if it is small dip it immediately 
into pure melted tallow. 

If the stain is dry and well set, use 
Javelle water. 

Lemon juice and salt, sour milk, and 
similar remedies are useful if suitable 
acids are not at hand, but cannot be 
depended on to do the work in a 
thorough manner. 

STAINS ON WHITE LINEN OR 
COTTON 

Ink Stains. — Substances recom- 
mended for removing ink from linen 
are salts of lemon, cream of tartar, 
citric acid, oxalic acid, lemon juice, 
vinegar, salt, sour milk, and chloride 
of lime. The treatment to be em- 
ployed depends necessarily upon the 
nature of ink. 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS 



753 



Ink stains should be treated as 
quickly as possible, before the ink 
has had a chance to set. While fresh, 
pour over them a quantity of salt, dry 
starch, or other absorbent, and brush 
it away as it absorbs the ink. Keep 
the spots wet, and continue applying 
the absorbent until the ink is re- 
moved. 

Or keep the spots wet with milk, 
and apply dry salt until the stains 
come out. 

Or wash the stains with sour milk 
and let them soak over night. 

Or dip the stains alternately in 
strong bran water and lemon juice 
until they disappear. 

Or use equal parts cream of tartar 
and powdered salts of sorrel (salts 
of lemon), dissolved in the smallest 
possible quantity of boiling water 
and applied hot. 

Or rinse carefully in clean water 
and apply oxalic acid. If this pro- 
duces a red tinge apply dilute aqua 
ammonia. 

Or dip small articles, as laces, 
handkerchiefs, and the like, in melted 
tallow and after the stain has dis- 
appeared remove the tallow by boil- 
ing in hot soapsuds. This last is 
perhaps the simplest and best of all 
remedies. 

To Remove Marking' Ink from 
Linen. — Apply fresh chloride of lime 
mixed with water. As soon as the 
color fades, dip into a solution of 
aqua ammonia or hyposulphite of soda, 
and rinse well before sending to the 
laundry. 

To Remove Indelible Ink. — Stains 
made by indelible ink containing ni- 
trate of silver may be removed by ap- 
plying chloride of copper. After- 
wards dip the article in hyposulphite 
of soda. 

Or apply a dilute solution of per- 
manganate of potash and muriatic 
acid, and follow with hyposulphite of 
soda. Cyanide of potash is also used 
for this purpose. It is highly poison- 
ous. 

Or melt pure tallow and pour over 
the ink spot while hot. Remove the 
tallow by dipping in hot water; re- 
peat if necessary. This is a method 
employed by many dyers and cleaners. 



and has the merit of not injuring the 
fabric. 

If lamp black has been used in the 
ink the stain cannot be wholly re- 
moved. 

To Remove Printer's Ink. — Soak 
the spots in turpentine for several 
hours. Rub them in the turpentine, 
as in washing. Let dry and brush 
thoroughly with a stiff brush. 

To Remove Iron Rust. — Use lemon 
juice, salt, and sunshine. Or a strong 
solution of oxalic acid rubbed in with 
the fingers. Or equal parts of pow- 
dered alum and salt applied dry to 
the wet fabric. 

Grass Stains. — Use tartaric acid or 
cream of tartar dissolved in boiling 
water. Apply hot. Or rub lard on 
the spot when fresh and afterwards 
wash as usual. 

Ink Stains. — Rub promptly with a 
slice of lemon. Or dip in pure melt- 
ed tallow. Or apply a saturated 
solution of oxalic acid or dilute 
muriatic acid or salts of lemon. 

Use dilute tartaric acid for colored 
goods. If the colors fade, renew with 
dilute aqua ammonia. 

Acid Stains. — Wash the article and 
dip in Javelle or chlorine water. For 
colored goods, moisten in dilute aqua 
ammonia. 

Nitrate of Silver or Nitric-acid 
Stains. — Apply iodine and rub briskly 
with strong aqua ammonia. 

Or apply a dilute solution of per- 
manganate of potash and hydro- 
chloric acid. Afterwards dip in a 
solution of hyposulphite of soda and 
rinse well. 

Mildew. — Boil in strong borax 
water. 

Iodine. — Soak for an hour or more 
in a warm solution of aqua ammonia 
and water. Then while still wet rub 
dry bicarbonate of potash into the 
stain until it is fully removed. 

Cod-liver Oil. — Add kerosene or 
aqua ammonia to the suds and boil. 

Red Wine. — Bleach witii snlphiiT 
fumes over an inverted funnel, or dip 
in Javelle or chlorine water. 

Tannin Stains. — These may be pro- 
duced by green chestnut burs, wal- 
nut husks, or substances used for 
tanning leather. Dip in hot Javelle 



754 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



or chlorine water, remove, and rinse 
quickly. Or apply a strong solution 
of tartaric acid. 

Red Stains from Colored Goods. — 
The dyes used for colored goods, red 
threads, etc., sometimes run and acci- 
dentally stain white goods. Apply 
fumes of sulphur through an invert- 
ed cone, or a saturated solution of 
o.xallc acid or Javelle or chlorine wa- 
ter. 

Mud Stains. — Dip the mud stains 
in kerosene before putting them in 
the boiler. Add kerosene to the 
boiling water. 

Grease Spots. — Apply a hot satu- 
rated solution of alum with a sponge 
or brush, or dissolve in 1 quart of 
warm water 2 ounces of aqua am- 
monia, 1 teaspoonful of saltpeter, and 
2 ounces of Castile soap. Soak the 
spot in this liquid and sponge. 

Or moisten French chalk with 
naphtha. Spread over the grease 
spot and brush off when dry. Or 
moisten salt with benzine or gasoline, 
and with this rub the spot until dry, 
being careful to rub from the outer 
edge toward the center of the 
spot. 

Or moisten the spot with butter or 
olive oil and rub with chloroform. 

Machine Grease or Oil. — Rub sal 
soda or cooking soda into the spot 
and pour boiling water through until 
the spot is removed. 

Or rub with turpentine, or naph- 
tha. 

To Dry-clean White Goods. — Small 
mud stains on a clean white skirt 
may be concealed until ready for the 
laundry by pipe clay or painting 
over with white water-color paint. 

Or if a clean white skirt or shirt 
waist is spattered or spotted by mud 
or soot, let it drj'^, scrape off with a 
penknife, and rub over the stain with 
white crayon or school chalk. 

Rub with a clean white cloth until 
the spot disappears. 

To Dry-clean Shirt Waists. — Put 4 
quarts of corn meal into a 2-4-pound 
flour sack or a pillow slip. Put the 
waist into this, and rub or knead 
gently so that the meal will come in 
contact with all parts of the fabric. 
Leave it there for a day or two, then 



shake and dust thoroughly, and press 
with a hot iron. 

Perspiration. — Use bay rum to re- 
move perspiration stain. 

To Clean Cotton Dress Skirts. — 
IMud stains may be removed from the 
bottom of a cotton dress skirt by 
folding several thicknesses of cloth, 
laying the soiled parts upon them, 
and scrubbing with a nailbrush, soap, 
and water. 

TO REMOVE STAINS FROM VEGE- 
TABLE FIBERS 

For strong tea stains, put a spoon- 
ful of sugar on the stain, dip into the 
water, and let it stand for a few min- 
utes. Afterwards rinse with clear 
water. 

Or, if not convenient to treat in 
this way, cover the stain with a quan- 
tity of powdered starch, let dry, and 
remove by brushing. 

When dried tea, coffee, or milk 
stains are found in table linen, rub 
the stains with butter and after- 
wards rub in hot soapsuds before 
laundering. 

Or apply the yolk of an egg mixed 
with a teaspoonful of glycerin. 

Or take 10 teaspoon fuls of water, 
1 teaspoonful of glycerin, and y, tea- 
spoonful of aqua ammonia. Dip the 
stain in this and allow it to dry. 
Repeat several times. Afterwards 
rub the spot between the fingers, and 
before sending the article to the 
laundry brush or scrub away the dry 
residue with the edge of a knife. 

Mildew on Linen. — Mildew may be 
removed from linen as from other 
fabrics with powdered chalk, lemon 
juice, salt, and pipe clay, and after- 
wards exposing to sunlight. Wash 
the spots in soapsuds made of hard 
white or yellow soap. Rub in pow- 
dered chalk with a flannel cloth, cov- 
er the spot with more chalk, and lay 
in the sun. Repeat if necessary. 

Or soak the spots in lemon juice 
and apply common salt. Afterwards 
cover with pipe clay or ]5owdered 
chalk, or use equal parts powdered 
starch and salt. 

To Remove Ink from Linen. — 
Treatment depends upon the nature 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS 



755 



of the ink. Stretch the linen before 
the steam of a teakettle and brush 
with a strong solution of salts of 
lemon. 

Or use acetic or muriatic acid, not 
too strong. Rinse as soon as the ink 
disappears. Or apply salt and 
lemon juice. Or use the juice of a 
ripe tomato. Squeeze the juice upon 
the ink and rub with the fingers. 
Rinse and apply the juice again, un- 
til the stain disappears. 

Linen, Marking Ink. — Apply a 
saturated solution of cyanide of po- 
tassium, (a deadly poison) rubbing 
with a glass rod. Rinse as soon as 
the ink disappears. 

Linen, Iron Rust and Mold. — Cov- 
er the stain with salts of lemon and 
stretch it across the steam of a tea- 
kettle or a saucepan full of boiling 
water, so that the salts of lemon will 
be gradually dissolved by the steam 
and soaked into the fabric. 

Or put a common dinner plate on 
top of a saucepan containing boiling 
water. Lay the linen over this, cov- 
er the stain with salts of lemon, and 
keep wet with hot water until the 
stain is removed. Afterwards rinse 
carefully in cold water. 

Or rub the spot with butter, then 
add a small quantity of potash Ij^e, 
and again rub the spot until the stain 
has disappeared. Rinse quickly in 
cold water. 

Brass Stains. — Rub with lard or 
olive oil and wash in warm water 
with soap. 

Linen, Yellow Stains. — If linen has 
faded yellow or become stained from 
perspiration, dissolve about one ta- 
ble-spoonful of pipe clay in the wa- 
ter in which it is boiled. 

Linen. Acid Stains. — Wet the arti- 
cle, and cover it with salts of worm- 
wood. Rub the dry salt into the wet 
fabric until the stain disappears. 
Afterwards rinse thoroughly. 

Or rub acid spots with dilute am- 
monia. Rinse with cold water. 

Or form a cone by twisting and 
pinning together a piece of paper, 
and under this light a number of old- 
fashioned brimstone matches or burn 
a bit of sulphur. Hold the stain so 
that the sulphurous-acid gas escap- 



ing through the cone will pass 
through it. 

Linen, Iodine Stains. — Dip the spot 
in cold water and hold it by the fire 
until dry. Repeat until the stain is 
removed. 

Linen, Fruit and Wine Stains. — 
While fresh put a little baking soda 
or washing soda on the stain, stretch 
it tightly over a bowl or pan, and 
pour boiling water upon the stain so 
as to dissolve the soda. No fresh 
fruit, wine, tea, coffee, or other com- 
mon stain is likely to withstand this 
treatment. Let the spot sink into 
the water and soak until the water 
cools, dipping it up and down and 
rubbing with the fingers. When the 
water cools repeat, if necessary, un- 
til the stain disappears. 

Or for more obstinate stains use 
Javelle solution and boiling water in 
equal quantities, immersing the 
stained portion, allowing it to soak 
a few minutes, and then rinsing 
thoroughly with boiling water. Use 
glycerine for peach stains. 

Or rub salts of lemon upon the 
stain and soak in hot water. Or dip 
in a weak solution of chloride of lime 
with water. Afterwards rinse care- 
fully. Or rub in starch with yellow 
soap, then apply starch thickly mois- 
tened with water and expose to the 
sun. Or soak in sour buttermilk. Or 
apply oxalic acid. 

Linen, Tea or Coffee Stains. — If 
tea or coffee stains are noticed at the 
time they are made, remove the ta- 
ble-cloth as soon as convenient, 
stretch the cloth over a pan, and pour 
boiling water through the stains. 

Or, if they are small and the table- 
cloth is clean, slip a saucer or small 
nappy containing boiling water un- 
der the tablecloth and let the stain 
lie in the water. Rub gently with 
the fingers until it is removed. Re- 
move the dish, put a folded napkin 
under the stain, and go over it with 
a warm iron. The cloth will then be 
as fresh as new without having been 
removed from the table. Add a little 
glycerin to the boiling water to re- 
move coffee stains. 

Or, if an old stain is found on a 
tablecloth in the laundry, first soak 



766 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



the spot in cold water without soap, 
and try to remove with boiling water 
and glycerin. If this is not effectual, 
mix the yolk of an egg with a table- 
spoonful of milk and a little warm 
water. Add a few drops of alcohol 
or chloroform, if convenient, and use 
this as soap. 

Milk and Cream. — Wash in cold 
water, then follow with soap. 

Linen, Wine Stains. — Pile a little 
dry salt on a fresh wine stain and it 
will absorb the wine. Afterwards 
rinse in boiling water. Dip old 
stains in boiling milk until removed. 

Linen, Blood Stains. — For fresh 
blood stains on white fabrics apply 
peroxide of hydrogen, which will im- 
mediately remove the color from the 
blood. This is a strong bleaching 
substance. Hence it must not be 
used on colored fabrics, and must be 
immediately rinsed, especially from 
woolen goods. 

Or soak in warm water and cover 
with dry pepsin. This will digest the 
blood. 

Or moisten the stain slightly with 
water and apply a thick layer of 
raw starch paste. Afterwards rinse 
in cold water. Repeat, if necessary. 

TO REMOVE STAINS FROM ANI- 
MAL FIBERS 

To Prepare Silks for Cleaning. — 
If silk garments are to be made over 
or if the silk is much soiled, rip them, 
remove all basting threads, and 
stretch out creases and wrinkles. 
Brush thoroughly all articles, in- 
cluding ribbons and small pieces, to 
remove dust and dirt, shake well, 
and stretch them to their original 
shape. Clear a wooden kitchen ta- 
ble or an ironing board, and on this 
stretch an old linen towel, tacking 
the corners down tightly. Smooth 
the silk out flat on the towel, and 
sponge first on the wrong side, after- 
wards on the right, applying with a 
small toothbrush or nailbrush or 
flannel cloth any of the following 
recipes that may be most convenient. 
After sponging on both sides rinse 
in clear cold water by dipjiing up 
and down, but without wringing or 



squeezing, partly dry in the shade, 
and j)ress between two pieces of 
cloth, ironing on the wrong side with 
a warm, not hot, iron. 

Or while wet spread the silk 
smoothly on a wooden polished sur- 
face, as a varnished table top, and 
let it dry near the fire. It will then 
require no ironing. 

Caution as to Silks. — Observe that 
no measures whatever for cleaning 
colored silks can be employed with 
safety unless the goods are properly 
dj'ed in fast colors. Many modem 
dyestuffs, especially in light and deli- 
cate colors, are very unstable and 
will spot or stain at the first applica- 
tion of any liquid hence it is well in 
all cases first to experiment with a 
sample of the goods to ascertain what 
method, if any, can be employed suc- 
cessfully. 

To Remove Grease from Silk. — For 
removing grease spots from silk, 
chloroform, French chalk, essence of 
lemon, turpentine, white clay, mag- 
nesia, yolk of egg, and benzine are 
all recommended. If possible, apply 
any of these while the grease is still 
warm. 

To Clean Silk and Velvet. — Sub- 
stances recommended for removing 
grease and other spots and stains 
from silks, satins, and velvets are al- 
cohol, chloroform, benzine, turpen- 
tine, juice of raw potato, magnesia, 
French chalk, pipe clay, yolk of egg, 
and various admixtures of these. Lay 
the stained article flat on a smooth 
surface and apply the cleanising fluid 
with a small sponge, toothbrush, or 
nailbrush, unless otherwise directed, 
until the stain is removed. Apply 
chloroform with a light, quick touch, 
using a bit of absorbent cotton or 
soft cotton rag. Dampen the grease, 
and when it disappears rub until dry 
with clean cloth. To use gasoline or 
benzine, add a teaspoonful of salt 
to each quart, wet the spot and also 
a rather large circle around it. Rub 
inward toward the spot as a center 
with quick, firm strokes, and if the 
benzine leaves a stain hold it in the 
steam of a tea-kettle until it disap- 
pears. 

Or rub grease spots with a lump of 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS

wet magnesia. This may be dusted 
oflf when dry. Or mix 4 ounces of 
rectified spirits of turpentine with 14 
ounce of pure alcohol. Or mix 2 
ounces of essence of lemon and 1 
ounce of oil of turpentine. Or use 
turpentine alone. Or mix 2 ounces 
of alcohol, 1 ounce of French chalk, 
and 5 ounces of pipe clay. Apply 
as a paste to the grease spots. 

Or cover grease spots thickly with 
French chalk, lay brown paper over 
them, and smooth with a hot iron. 
The iron will melt the grease, and 
the chalk and paper will absorb 
it. 

Or if chalk is not at hand lay a 
piece of brown paper on the iron- 
ing board, lay the silk over this, place 
another piece of brown paper on top, 
and press with a hot iron, but not so 
hot as to scorch the fabric. This is 
a most effective method. 

Or apply the yolk of an egg with 
or without the addition of 12 drops 
of chloroform or a teaspoonful of al- 
cohol. Afterwards rinse with warm 
water. 

To Clean Silk with Potato Juice. — 
Grate two fair-sized clean raw po- 
tatoes into each pint of water used 
and strain through cheese cloth. Let 
the resulting liquor stand until the 
potato starch it contains settles to 
the bottom, then pour off the clear 
liquid and bottle it. Lay a wash- 
board down flat, spread over this a 
clean cloth, and lay the silk upon it. 
Apply the potato juice with a sponge 
until the silk is clean, and afterwards 
rinse it in clear cold water. 

To Clean Silk with Gasoline. — 
Gasoline and benzine may be applied 
to silk with a sponge, but this should 
be done by daylight and never in the 
vicinity of an open fire or flame of 
any kind. These liquids are highly 
volatile, producing a gas which will 
ignite and explode if it comes in con- 
tact with an open flame. After 
cleansing with gasoline or benzine 
rinse the silk in alcohol. 

Black Silk. — Various substances 
are recommended for cleaning black 
silks, including infusion of oxgall, 
logwood, copperas, tea, coffee, fig 
leaves, vinegar, and ammonia. The 



preparation and use of these is ex- 
plained below. 

Dust the article carefully, spread 
smooth on a flat surface, and apply, 
with a sponge or piece of flannel, a 
cold, strong infusion of black tea. 
Or use equal parts of clear cold cof- 
fee and soft water. Or equal parts 
of coffee and aqua ammonia. Or a 
dilute solution of aqua ammonia in 
water. 

Any left-over tea or coffee may be 
used for this purpose. Strain through 
cheese cloth to remove the dregs. 
Sponge or scrub both sides of the 
fabric, taking care not to crease it. 
Make the silk quite wet. Smooth the 
articles carefully and press as for 
other silk fabrics. Coffee removes 
grease and renews the silk without 
making it shiny. 

Or sponge with oxgall slightly di- 
luted with boiling water and applied 
warm. Rinse in cold water from 
time to time and continue the 
oxgall until the rinsing water is 
clear. 

Or make a strong solution of log- 
wood by boiling 1 ounce in 2 quarts 
of water down to 1 pint. Wash the 
silk clean, immerse in the solution 
and simmer with gentle heat for half 
an hour. Remove the silk, add Y^ 
ounce of copperas to the solution, 
strain through cheese cloth, and dip 
the silk in it. 

Or wash the articles in gasoline, 
dipping them up and down and rub- 
bing lightly between the hands as in 
water. Care must be taken not to 
wrinkle or crease the fabric. This 
removes the dirt quickly and does not 
cause the colors to run. 

To Remove Wax from Silk.— 
Scrape off the excess of wax from 
the surface of the fabric with a pen- 
knife. Apply French chalk made 
into a paste with water. Lay the 
silk on a piece of brown paper spread 
over the ironing board, put another 
sheet of brown paper on it, and press 
with a hot iron. 

Or toast a piece of soft bread be- 
fore the fire until quite hot, but not 
burned, and rub the wax spot with 
the hot bread until cold. Take an- 
other piece, and so continue until the 



768 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



wax is removed. Afterwards rub 
with the dry bread crumbs until per- 
fectly clean. 

Silk — To Remove Paint. — Apply 
a mixture of 5 parts of spirits of tur- 
pentine and 1 j)art of essence of 
lemon with a small brush, sponge, 
or linen rag. Or apply turpentine 
alone. 

Silk — To Remove Tar. — Rub lard 
on the tar, and afterwards wash with 
soapsuds. 

Silk, Stains of Sea Water. — Sponge 
with dilute aqua ammonia and wa- 
ter. 

Silk, Acid Stains. — If the color has 
been taken out by acid stains, apply 
aqua ammonia. 

To Remove Acid Stains from Vio- 
let Silk. — First apply tincture of 
iodine, and immediately afterwards 
cover the spot with hyposulphite of 
soda dissolved in water. Hang in 
the shade to dry. 

To Clean Velvet. — First dust the 
velvet thoroughly, using for this pur- 
pose an old piece of roUed-up crape. 
Sponge with benzine or gasoline, 
same as silk. Stretch the velvet right 
side up over a basin of boiling wa- 
ter so that the steam must pass 
through it. While thus stretched 
brush with a whisk broom in the di- 
rection of the nap. The time spent 
depends upon the condition of the 
velvet, but if patiently continued the 
result will be entirely satisfactory. 
Any ingenious person can arrange a 
contrivance to hold the velvet in place 
while brushing, or an assistant may 
do so. 

Or dampen a newspaper and set it 
in a hot oven until it steams. Lay 
this on the ironing board, cover it 
with a folded cotton cloth, and lay 
the velvet on it. While the steam is 
rising, brushing the velvet against the 
pile. 

Or heat a flatiron, turn it face up- 
ward, and lay a wet cotton cloth on 
it. Lay the velvet, nap up, over the 
iron, and brush while steaming. 

To Revive Faded Velvet or Plush. 
— Brush slightly with a sponge dipped 
in chloroform. 

To Clean Satin. — Sponge satin 
neckties and other small articles with 



a weak solution of borax, following 
the grain, and afterwards iron on the 
wrong side. 

To Clean White Silk.— White silk 
may be washed in soapsuds the same 
as other delicate white fabrics, if care 
is taken not to rub or squeeze the fab- 
ric so as to cause creases or wrin- 
kles. 

Or it may be washed in gasoline, 
or dry-cleaned by rubbing or dusting 
it with magnesia and laying it away 
for two or three days in a paper 
bag covered with magnesia, after- 
wards brushing it with a soft, heavy 
brush. 

Naphtha soap will remove most 
stains from white silk, including 
paint stains. 

To Bleach White Silk. — When 
white silk articles have become j'el- 
low from the laundry or from being 
packed away, dip them in a solution 
of one tablespoonful of ammonia to 
a quart of warm water. Squeeze 
out this solution, and rinse in blu- 
ing water until fully restored. Hang 
in the shade to dry and while damp 
press between dry cloths on the 
wrong side. 

Or dissolve 4 ounces of salt and 4 
ounces of oxalic acid in 6 quarts of 
water. Immerse the silk in this solu- 
tion until it is bleached white. This 
will require a half hour to an hour 
or more. Rinse thoroughly. 

To Remove Stains from Colored 
Silks. — To remove acid stains, apply 
liquid ammonia with a brush or soft 
rag, taking care not to rub the fab- 
ric, as the ammonia may cause the 
colors to fade or run. Should this 
happen, afterwards apply chloro- 
form to restore the color. 

Or cover the spot with cooking 
soda or magnesia and moisten with 
clear water. 

TO CLEAN COLORED GOODS 

Alkali Stains. — Moisten the spot 
with vinegar or tartaric acid, and af- 
terwards a})ply chloroform to restore 
its color. 

Grease Spots or Pitch. — Cover the 
spot with fuller's eartli, pijie clay, or 
French chalk. Place between blot- 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS 



759 



ters or layers of brown paper and 
press with a hot iron. 

Fruit and Wine Stains. — Wet with 
a mixture of equal parts of alcohol 
and ammonia. Afterwards sponge 
gently with alcohol until the stain is 
removed. 

Or rub the spot with soap, and ap- 
ply chloride of soda with a camel's- 
hair brush, rinsing quickly and thor- 
oughly. 

Wax Stains. — Scrape off the sur- 
plus of wax from the surface of the 
fabric, dissolve with alcohol, and re- 
move by rubbing gently with a clean 
flannel rag or pressing with a hot 
iron through brown paper. 

Oil Stains. — Cover with French 
chalk, pipe clay, or fuller's earth, and 
wet with water to a thin paste. Let 
this dry on the fabric and remove by 
brushing. Repeat if necessary. 

Mud Stains. — Let the mud dry 
thoroughly, and then remove as much 
as possible by brushing. When fully 
dry, cover with a mixture of salt and 
flour and keep in a dry place. 

If the stains are extensive place the 
garment in a large paper flour sack 
with a quantity of salt and flour well 
mixed, shake vigorously, tie up the 
sack, and allow it to hang behind the 
stove for a few days. Afterwards 
shake out the dust and press. 

Or, while the stains are wet, cover 
thickly with cornstarch and brush 
away until the stain has disappeared. 
W^hen dry, make a thick paste of 
cornstarch with warm water, lay 
over the stains, and brush ofif when 
dry. Repeat if necessary. 

Rust Stains. — Apply a solution of 
salts of lemon. 

Ink Stains. — Apply 1 teaspoonful 
of dilute oxalic acid to 6 ounces of 
water. Or moisten the spots with a 
strong solution of citric acid. Or dip 
the spots in milk and cover with salt. 
If the colors are affected, restore 
them with aqua ammonia and chloro- 
form. 

Tar. — Rub lard over the tar and 
wash in soapsuds. Or apply oil of 
turpentine, rub with soap, and wash. 
Or soak in olive or sweet oil for 
twenty-four hours. Afterwards wash 
in soapsuds. 



TO CLEAN lACES 

To Dry-clean Lace. — Stretch the 
lace carefully on a thick piece of 
wrapping paper, fastening the edges 
with pins. Sprinkle it quite thickly 
with calcined magnesia. Cover with 
another piece of wrapping paper, and 
place it under a pile of books or other 
heavy weight for three or four days. 
The magnesia can then be shaken off 
and the lace will appear like new. It 
will not only be clean, but the edges 
will be in perfect condition. Calcined 
magnesia is very cheap, and this 
method is well worth trying. 

Or stretch the lace, if not too much 
soiled, on a piece of cloth, pin all the 
points, and work over it with the soft 
part of a loaf of fine bread, not too 
dry, and afterwards shake out the 
crumbs. 

Or use bread crumbs, rubbing them 
over the lace with a soft cloth, con- 
stantly using fresh crumbs, and 
changing the cloth as it becomes 
soiled. 

Or dust a mixture of flour and 
magnesia into the fiber of the lace, 
and rub it with a soft cloth. After- 
wards put the lace under pressure for 
a few hours. 

To Clean Gold and Silver Lace. — 
Stretch the lace and tack it down 
on a piece of woolen cloth, following 
the outline of the pattern carefully 
with basting thread. Brush it thor- 
oughly free from dust. Sprinkle 
over it a mixture of dry crumbs or 
stale bread, and powdered laundry 
blue. Rub gently with a piece of 
flannel until clean. 

Or use burnt alum, pulverized to a 
fine powder, and sifted through 
cheese cloth. Apply with a fine, soft 
brush. 

Or sponge with alcohol. After- 
wards polish with a piece of red vel- 
vet. 



TO DRY-CLEAN MEN'S GARMENTS 

To Clean Men's Clothes. — Hang: the 
garments on a line, beat them with 
a carriage whip or piece of rubber 
hose, and brush them thoroughly with 
a stiff brush. To remove spots, place 



760 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



several thicknesses of soft cloth, like 
an old towel, under the spot, moisten 
it with water, and scour with any 
good cleanser, or moisten the spot 
thoroughly with a liquid cleanser and 
rub it hard. Use for this purpose 
a loofah, a stiff, fibrous sponge, cost- 
ing about ten cents. This is rough 
enough to scrub with vigor if the 
goods will stand it, or it can be used 
more gently on delicate goods. It 
leaves no lint as cloth does, but is 
stiffer than a sponge and can be easily 
washed and dried after being used. 
Or use one or more small scrubbing 
brushes of varying degrees of stiff- 
ness. 

To Remove Spots. — First hold the 
garment up to the light to see if 
there is any surface dirt; if there is, 
scrape off with a sharp knife what 
can be removed (taking care not to 
injure the weave of the garment) be- 
fore wetting the spot in water, cleans- 
ing fluid, or any sort of chemical. 
Next apply the cleanser and rub well, 
so that the dirt when dissolved may 
be forced through into the pad be- 
neath. Rub with a piece of woolen 
cloth folded into a tight pad. Use 
plenty of " elbow grease." The se- 
cret of success lies in hard rubbing. 

To Press Men's Clothes. — Spread 
the garment right side up on an iron- 
ing board, lay over it a cotton cloth 
wrung out of warm water containing- 
about 1 tablespoonful of aqua am- 
monia to 3 pints of water, and iron 
the wet cloth until both the cloth and 
the garment are perfectly dry. This 
prevents the garment from having a 
shiny appearance. 

Black Dye for Renovating, — Put 8 
ounces of logwood chips in a porce- 
lain kettle, cover with 2 quarts of soft 
water, and let stand over night. Boil 
30 minutes, strain through cheese 
cloth, and add 6 grains of prussiate 
of potash and 12 grains of bichro- 
mate of potash previously dissolved 
in as little boiling water as possible. 
Pour this mixture into a black glass 
bottle, cork tightly, and store in a 
dark place. This is a good black 
dye. To ajiply, first sponge or other- 
wise cleanse the garments, stretch 
them out smooth, and go over them 



with this dye by means of a soft 
brush. Let dry thoroughly before 
pressing. 

To Clean a Mackintosh. — To clean 
a mackintosh, scrub both sides with 
soap and water, and afterwards rinse 
it in clear water until the soap is re- 
moved. Hang up to dry without 
wringing. Care must be taken not to 
sponge a mackintosh with alcohol, 
chloroform, benzine, gasoline, tur- 
pentine, or any of the chemicals 
which are used in sponging other 
fabrics, as they have the property of 
dissolving rubber and will injure the 
texture of many waterproof gar- 
ments. Ammonia may be applied 
freely. 

To Renovate "Woolen Goods. — 
After woolen dress goods have been 
sponged or washed, to restore the 
original gloss rub the cloth with a 
brush dipped in a thin solution of 
gum arable, cover with a dry cotton 
cloth, and dry under a weight. This 
method is useful to remove the spot 
caused by sponging out stains. To 
raise the nap on a rough woolen gar- 
ment, wet it, lay it on a smooth sur- 
face, and roughen it gently with a 
common prickly thistle, or what is 
known as a teasel brush. After- 
wards brush with a stiff clothes brush 
the way of the nap. 

To Clean Men's Woolen Clothes. — 
Boil for half an hour 2 ounces of soap 
bark in 1 quart of water, and let 
stand all night on the dregs. Strain 
through cheese cloth, and use alone 
or combined with an equal amoimt of 
gasoline. Or use 1 part of oxgall to 
16 parts of water. Or use 1 table- 
spoonful of oxgall and 1 teaspoonful 
of cooking soda to a quart of water. 
Or mix 1 ounce of sulphuric ether, 1 
ounce of aqua ammonia, and 6 ounces 
of water. 

The most convenient way to clean 
men's garments is to remove the cov- 
er from an ironing board, or use 
some other smooth, clean, narrow 
board or plank, arranged to admit of 
laying the coat smoothly over it, or 
insert the board into the trousers 
legs. A smooth, hard, narrow board 
is also desirable for coat sleeves. 
Arrange the garment on this board 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS 



761 



and with a stifiP brush apply any of 
the cleansers you prefer. A bristle 
nailbrush or horsehair brush, such as 
is used in the stable for smoothing 
the coats of horses, is a most useful 
implement for this purpose. Rub 
with, rather than against, the nap of 
the cloth, wetting the brush fre- 
quently. 

Scrub especially spots of grease 
and, if much soiled by perspiration, 
the collar and cuffs. When the 
.grease and dirt are thoroughly 
loosened, sponge with clear water 
until quite clean. Trousers and 
waistcoats may be rinsed by immers- 
ing in water and sousing up and 
down, but it is better not to immerse 
coats and jackets, as it is difficult, on 
account of the padded linings, to 
press them into shape. 

To Renovate Men's Clothes. — Boil 
8 ounces of logwood chips in 2 gal- 
lons of water down to 1 gallon. 
Strain and add 2 ounces of gum ara- 
ble, dissolved in a little hot water. 
Bottle for future use. 

After dark, solid-colored garments, 
as blacks, blues, or browns, have 
been scrubbed and sponged, dilute 
this mixture to the shade of the gar- 
ment, and go over it lightly with a 
sponge. Do not expose to direct sun- 
shine or the heat of a stove while dry- 
ing. 

Or moisten a soft brush with olive 
oil and carefully go over the gar- 
ment. 

To remove a shiney appearance 
from the seat of a man's trousers, or 
the sleeves, of his coat, sponge 
thoroughly with water to which laun- 
dry bluing has been added and press 
with a cloth dampened in the same. 

To Press Men's Clothes. — After 
sponging the garments, stretch them 
to their proper shape, lay them right 
side up over the ironing board, and 
press through linen or cotton cloth 
previously wrung out of clear cold 
water. A tablespoonful each of ox- 
gall and salt added to every gallon 
of water will tend to brighten the 
colors. Press with a hot iron until 
the garment is dry. 

Care must be taken that all the 
liquid preparations used for clean- 



ing woolen goods be kept at the same 
temperature, which should be about 
as warm as the hands will bear com- 
fortably. 

A large piece of white canvass to 
dampen and spread over both men's 
and women's garments while press- 
ing is a great convenience since it does 
not roll up or wrinkle under the iron. 

After the garments have been 
pressed, brush with the nap while the 
steam is still rising from the cloth, 
and hang on suitable clothes hangers 
or over chairs to dry. Do not wear 
them for twenty-four hours or more 
after pressing, or until they are 
thoroughly dry. 

TO DRY-CLEAN WOMEN'S GAR- 
MENTS 

To Clean Woolen Dresses. — The 
most satisfactory method of clean- 
ing waists or skirts of wool, silk, vel- 
vet, or anything except cotton goods, 
is to soak and wash them in gasoline. 
For this purpose two or three large 
earthen jars will be found very use- 
ful. It pays to buy the best gasoline, 
five gallons at a time, and use it 
plentifully, as the expense is much 
less than would be the charge of a 
professional cleaner, or the cost of a 
new garment. 

First, dust the garments and rub 
soap on soiled or greasy spots. 
Nothing need be removed from them 
except rubber dress shields. 

Next, put large pieces, one at a 
time, in an earthen jar and cover 
with gasoline. Throw a wet cloth 
over the jar, and press the lid down 
tightly. Soak for an hour or more, 
then rub the article well, sousing it 
up and down, and transfer it to a 
second jar containing an equal 
amount of fresh gasoline. Rinse in 
this, squeeze out the gasoline, and 
hang up to dry. A third jar may be 
used if desired. 

Articles washed in this way will re- 
quire to be hung out and aired for 
two or three days, when the odor 
will entirely leave them. They 
should not be pressed until they are 
thoroughly dry and all the gasoline 
has evaporated. The gasoline can be 



76a 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



poured back into the cans through 
cheese cloth and used again, as the 
dirt settles to the bottom. This op- 
eration must be carried on out of 
doors, as much of the gasoline will 
evaporate. If done in the house the 
odor would be very unpleasant, and, 
besides, the vapor is explosive and 
might cause accident. A small bris- 
tle brush dipped in the gasoline will 
be found useful for removing grease 
spots, scrubbing collars, and the like. 
If a small quantity of gasoline be 
put in a tin can and then surrounded 
by a vessel of boiling water (but not 
on the stove), it will do the work 
more quickly and thoroughly. 

To Dry-clean a White Woolen Coat 
or other similar garment, saturate a 
package of cornstarch in gasoline and 
spread this over the garment with a 
soft clothes brush. Roll the garment 
and lay it away for several days, or 
until the gasoline has evaporated, 
leaving the starch dry. Then shake 
out and brush thoroughly. 

Or mix 1 quart of coarse corn meal, 

1 cup of salt, and enough gasoline 
to moisten. Place the garment on a 
firm surface and rub thoroughly with 
this mixture, covering as large a sur- 
face as possible at one time. Rub un- 
til dry. Make a second application, 
if necessary. 

Crape, Mourning, and Other Black 
Goods. — Black dress goods may be 
washed by observing the same caution 
as for other colored fabrics, whether 
cotton, linen, wool, or silk. To re- 
move stains before laundering, apply 
a solution of 1 part of alcohol and 

2 parts of water with a soft cloth, 
sponge, or soft bristle brush. 

To remove paint, apply spirits of 
turpentine; for grease, apply benzine 
or gasoline; for mud stains, rub the 
spot with a piece of raw potato. 

To Remove Gloss. — Sponge with a 
saturated solution of borax and water. 
Afterwards sponge with clear 
water. 

Or boil half a handful of fig leaves 
in a quart of water down to a pint. 
Strain and apply the clear liquor. 

Crape Lace. — Dissolve a square 
inch of sheet glue in a pint of boiling 
water, add a pint of skim milk, and 



dip the lace in this while boiling hot. 
When cool enough to handle, remove, 
stretch, and clap the lace between the 
hands. Pin it to a linen cloth and 
stretch the cloth tent fashion to dry 
in the shade. 

White Spots. — If white spots or 
light-colored stains appear on black 
garments, apply India ink, marking 
ink, or common ink with a camel's- 
hair brush. Put a piece of blotting 
paper underneath the stain to absorb 
the surplus ink. 

To Revive Faded Colors. — In 3 
quarts of boiling water stir H pound 
of green vitriol, 1 pound of logwood 
chips, and i/g pound of bruised galls. 
Boil gently for 3 hours and strain 
through cheese cloth. 

Or mix oxgall, 4 ounces; logwood, 
Yz ounce; green vitriol, i/, ounce; iron 
filings, y, ounce; sumac, % ounce, and 
vinegar, 1 quart. 

Or make a simple solution of log- 
wood, boiling 3 ounces of logwood in 
1 gallon of water down to 1 quart. 

To apply any of the above, dilute 
with suflBcient hot water to cover the 
articles, and boil for half an hour. 
If the infusion of logwood is used 
alone, remove the articles, add an 
ounce of sulphate of iron, and boil 
for half an hour. Hang them up 
without wringing in a shady place 
until they cease to drip. Then rinse 
them in cold water, let them dry, and 
rub gently with a brush moistened 
with a little olive oil. 

To Clean and Scour Woolen Goods. 
— Remove all dirt and dust by shak- 
ing and brushing the articles. Re- 
move grease spots with turpentine, 
benzine, or gasoline. Make a strong 
suds of hard white or curd soap with 
water, and to each gallon add a table- 
spoonful of oxgall. Apply vigorous- 
ly with a fairly stiff nailbrush. Rinse 
by sponging with warm water con- 
taining salt, and dry by rubbing with 
a piece of clean flannel. 

Or, for garments which will not lose 
their shape, rinse in clear cold water 
and hang up to dry. 

Sponging with stale lager beer will 
give some stiffness and gloss to the 
surface. 

Clear black coffee will clean black 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS 



763 



cloth if diluted with water contain- 
ing a little ammonia. 

Or go over the surface with a brush 
slightly moistened with olive oil. 

To Dry-clean Woolen Cloth. — Re- 
move all spots and stains, and cover 
the garment with clean, damp sand, 
with which may be mixed a quantity 
of French chalk. Rub over the sur- 
face of the sand with the hands to 
work it into the texture of the fabric, 
and allow the garment to dry. Af- 
terwards brush off the sand. 

To Clean Scarlet Cloth. — 'Wash in 
bran water, and rinse in clear water 
containing a tablesi^oonful of solution 
of tin to each gallon. 

Or add a small quantity of scarlet 
dye to the last rinsing water. 

To Clean Light-colored Worsteds. — 
For delicate light-brown or buff col- 
ors apply pipe clay mixed with water 
to the consistency of milk. Cover the 
surface with this by means of a sponge 
or brush. Brush off when dry. 

To Shrink Broadcloth and Prevent 
from Spotting. — Take a large Avhite 
cloth, as a sheet, dip in warm water, 
partially wring it, lay it on a table, 
put the broadcloth on it, roll, and 
lay aside for a few hours. It need 
not be opened out full width until 
ready to press. Press on wrong side 
with a hot iron until dry. 

CLEANING AND CARE OF GLOVES 

To Clean Gloves. — For cleaning 
gloves, gasoline, benzine, naphtha, and 
soap used with either milk or water, 
fuller's earth, with or without pow- 
dered alum, cream of tartar, pipe 
clay, French chalk, bread crumbs, and 
corn meal are all recommended; for 
fruit and acid stains, ammonia; for 
ink stains, oxalic acid; and various 
compounds of these substances. 

Gasoline. — Draw the gloves on to 
the hands and wash them in gasoline 
in the same fashion as the hands are 
washed in water. For best results, 
place the bowl containing gasoline in 
a basin of very hot water. The ad- 
dition of a teaspoonful of salt to the 
quart of gasoline will also assist. 

MHpe off surplus gasoline with a 
piece of flannel, and allow the gloves 



to partially dry on the hands. After- 
wards hang on a line to dry in the 
sun. 'Ihe soiled parts of the gloves 
may be rubbed with any good white 
hard soap during this process. But 
they should not afterwards be washed 
in soapsuds, as it shrinks and wrinkles 
them. For light glace kid gloves, 
draw the gloves on to the hands and 




" Wash Them in Gasoline." 

with a flannel cloth apply a paste com- 
posed of flour and gasoline. Rub with 
a clean, dry cloth until quite dry. 

Turpentine. — Before the discovery 
of gasoline, gloves were cleaned by 
washing in spirits of turpentine in 
the same way as they are now washed 
in gasoline. Turpentine is to be pre- 
ferred when the gloves are stained 
with paint or resinous substances. 

Benzine. — Place the gloves in a 
large fruit jar full of benzine, screw 
on the lid and let them soak for twen- 
ty minutes or more, shaking the jar 
vigorously at intervals. Take them 
out and examine for dirt spots, which 
may be removed by rubbing with ben- 
zine on a flannel rag. Afterwards 
hang them up to dry in the open air. 
To remove the odor of benzine, pro- 
fessional cleaners dry articles cleaned 
in this manner in a drying room at 
at temperature of about 200°. But 
this odor will pass off after a time.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Or draw the gloves on the hands, dip 
a flannel rag in benzine, and allow 
it to become nearly dry. While 
slightly damp, moisten the gloves with 
this by rubbing the hands with it as 
if with a towel. 

Or take part of a loaf of bread 
slightly moist, or dry bread crumbs, 
and rub lightly over the gloves until 
they are clean. Change the crumbs 
as they become soiled. Repeat if 
necessary. 

Milk for Kid Gloves. — Draw the 
gloves on the hands, dip a cloth in 
skim milk, and wipe them on the cloth 
as if on a towel. Let them dry on 
the hands. 

Or draw a glove on one hand and 
with the other hand dip a piece of 
flannel in new milk, rub on castile 
soap or any good hard white soap, 
and rub the soiled glove lightly. 

Or lay the glove on a folded towel, 
dip a flannel cloth in milk, rub on 
castile soap or other white soap, and 
rub the glove lightly, working from 
the back or wrist toward the fin- 
gers. 

To Dry-clean Gloves. — Delicate 
white kid or su^de gloves may be dry- 
cleaned with cream of tartar, mag- 
nesia, fuller's earth, alum, pipe clay, 
corn meal, or various compounds of 
these. 

A simple method is to draAV the 
gloves on the hands and wash them 
thoroughly in fine corn meal. 

Or place the glove in a paper bag 
or fruit jar, fill them with a mixture 
of magnesia and cream of tartar, 
cover them with it, shake the bag, and 
let it stand over night. Rub off this 
mixture with a flannel cloth inside 
and out, draw the gloves on the hands, 
and apply a mixture of powdered 
alum and fuller's earth with a small, 
soft brush, sponge, nailbrush, or tooth- 
brush. 

Or brush with fuller's earth with- 
out powdered alum, and dust it off. 

If the gloves are not entirely clean, 
draw them on the hands and apply 
fine bran or pipe clay, or a mixture of 
both. None of these substances will 
injure the gloves, and if one is not 
at hand use another. Bread crumbs 
are also useful, especially when the 



gloves are much soiled. Change the 
crumbs as they become dirty. 

To Clean Wash-leather Gloves. — 
Wash-leather gloves may be cleaned 
with soap and water. Draw them on 
the hands and with a shaving brush 
apply a lather of fine shaving or toilet 
soap. Wipe them on a clean towel 
and let them dry on the hands. 

Or, if much soiled with perspira- 
tion, apply a mixture of magnesia and 
cream of tartar, filling and covering 
the gloves and letting them stand over 
night. Rub off with a flannel cloth, 
draw the gloves on the hands, and 
wash them in lukewarm suds made 
Avith fine white soap, rinse in warm 
water, and let them remain on the 
hands until quite dry. 

To Color Wash-leather Gloves. — 
While the gloves are still damp they 
may be colored yellow by rubbing 
with yellow ochcr, or white by rub- 
bing with pipe clay, or any desired 
intermediate shade by mixing the two. 
Mix into a paste with stale beer or 
vinegar. 

To Renovate Kid Gloves. — White 
kid gloves that are stained bevond 
cleaning may be dyed to a tan shade 
by applying two or three coats of 
saffron and water, drying them be- 
tween the coatings. Apply to the 
surface with a soft brush, wetting as 
little as possible. Black kid or suede 
gloves when defaced may be improved 
by painting the worn spots with a 
mixture of black ink and olive oil. 
Apply it with a camel's-hair brush or 
feather, touch the spots lightly, and 
observe the effect by allowing the 
glove to dry before adding more 
color. Repeat if necessary. 

Glove Cleaners. — Scrape one poimd 
of castile or other hard white soap 
into a powder, place in a fruit jar, 
and add alcohol sufficient to make a 
soap jelly. Stir in a teaspoonful of 
ether or chloroform and keep the 
cover of the jar glued tight. 

Or grate ly^ pounds of castile soap 
in 15 ounces of water and dissolve 
with gentle heat. Melt 3 ounces of 
soap in an equal bulk of water, add 
2 ounces of .lavelle water and 1 tea- 
spoonful of ammonia. This will form 
a thick paste or jell. Apply by put-

ting the gloves on and using a flannel 
cloth. Dry the gloves on the hands. 

To Remove Stains. — Put a few 
tablespoonfuls of aqua ammonia in a 
large two-quart fruit jar, or other 
wide-mouthed bottle or can or similar 
receptacle, taking care not to wet the 
mouth or sides of the vessel. Sus- 
pend the gloves in this vessel above 
the ammonia, where they will be 
penetrated by its fumes, and cover 
tightly. Do not allow the gloves to 
touch the ammonia water. This proc- 
ess will not injure the most delicate 
colors. 

To Remove Ink Stains from Gloves. 
— First dip the stained part in melted 
tallow to absorb the ink. Afterwards 
cover with pipe clay. 

Or, if the stain is not removed, 
make a solution of 1 part of oxalic 
acid to 10 parts of water, and gently 
apply it to the spot with the tip of 
the finger, using as little as possible. 

Follow with a drop of aqua am- 
monia or wet the spot and cover with 
common soda, to neutralize the effect 
of the acid. 

To Clean Kid Gloves. — Shave 2 
ounces of white soap and dissolve in 
a pint of milk with gentle heat. Add 
the white of 1 egg and beat up the 
whole with an egg beater. Add a tea- 
spoonful of sulphuric ether, draw on 
the gloves, and apply the paste with 
a small bit of sponge until clean. It 
is best to keep the gloves on until 
they are dry. This method not only 
cleans but softens and revives the 
leather. 

Or draw the gloves on the hand and 
go over them with a cloth dipped in 
skim milk. Wear them until quite 
dry. 

Or moisten a small sponge or piece 
of cloth in skim milk, rub it on a 
cake of castile or other hard white 
soap, and with this sponge the gloves 
all over until they are clean. Wear 
them until dry. 

Or shave fine 3 ounces of castile 
or other hard white soap in 2 ounces 
of water, and dissolve with gentle 
heat. Remove from the fire, and when 
cold stir in -2 ounces of Javelle water 
and 1 teaspoonful of aqua ammonia. 
Apply with a flannel cloth. 



Or put the gloves in a large-stop- 
pered bottle about half filled with ben- 
zine and let stand several hours, shak- 
ing frequently. Remove the gloves, 
sponge any spots with benzine or 
ether, and hang up to dry. 

Or draw the gloves on to the hands 
and wash in benzine or turpentine. 
Dry on a soft muslin cloth or towel 
and hang up in a draught until the 
odor disappears. 

To Polish Kid Gloves. — Apply tal- 
cum or other good toilet powder or 
French chalk with a piece of soft 
muslin. 

To Clean Chamois. — To clean gloves 
and other articles of chamois skin, 
dissolve 3 tablespoonfuls of aqua am- 
monia in 1 quart of warm water. 
Soak the articles in this for an hour 
or more. Stir occasionally with a 
wooden spoon. Press out as much of 
the dirt as possible. Pour all into a 
basin of warm water, wash with the 
hands, rinse in clear soft water, dry 
in the shade, and rub between the 
hands until soft. 



TO CLEAN FEATHERS, FURS, AND 
STRAW 

To Clean Feathers. — Prepare suds 
by shaving and boiling half a bar of 
hard white or naphtha soap in a 
saucepan with sufficient water. Dilute 
with warm soft water. Immerse the 
plume in this and allow it to soak for 
ten or fifteen minutes, occasionally 
drawing it rather loosely through the 
hands to strip out the dirt with the 
suds. Rinse in water of the same 
temperature. If not yet clean, lay 
the feather on a smooth surface and 
with a soft toothbrush rub gently 
with soap and water, working out- 
wardly from the stem. Rinse in clear 
warm water and afterwards, if a 
white feather, in bluing water. Draw 
through the palm of the hand to 
squeeze out the water, but without 
twisting. Pin or stitch the stem to a 
cloth and hang up to dry with the 
thick end of the stem up and the 
plumage hanging down. Shake oc- 
casionally while drying it, or, if time 
will permit, shake the feathers near 
the stove until dry. 



766 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Or dry out of doors in a gentle 
breeze. But care must be taken that 
the wind does not whip the feather 
and break the stem. 

ftuick Process for Coloring Feath- 
ers, Velvet, Chiffon, Ribbon, Lace, 
etc. — Always use Windsor and New- 
ton Tube Paints. Take one drop of 
the tube paint, rub smooth in a saucer, 
add a little gasoline, and mix well. 
Put in enough gasoline to cover the 
material nicely. Draw the feather or 
other material through the mixture, 
shake out, and dry. If not the desired 
shade, dip again, or add a little more 
paint to the gasoline to get the re- 
quired shade. The material dyed will 
not need any pressing. The most 
delicate fabrics may be dyed in this 
manner without harming them in the 
least. 

To Renovate Feathers. — Black 
feathers after having been washed 
may be restored to their original lus- 
ter as follows: dissolve 1 ounce of 
sulphate of iron in 1 quart of hot 
water. Immerse the feathers in this 
and let them steep until the liquid is 
cold. Hang up in a shady place to 
dry. Make a solution of logwood and 
gallnuts by boiling y^ ounce of each 
in a copper vessel with 1 quart of 
water down to 1 pint. Remove from 
the fire, while hot, immerse the feath- 
ers, and allow them to remain until 
cool. Rinse in clear water and dry. 
Lay them on a smooth surface and 
rub from the stem outwardly with a 
piece of flannel slightly moistened in 
olive oil. 

Grebe Feathers and Other Skins. — 
Tliese may be washed in the same 
manner as ostrich plumes by first re- 
moving the lining. They must be 
handled with great care to prevent 
injury by tearing. 

To Curl Feathers. — Feathers which 
have temporarily lost their curl from 
exposure to rain or fog may be im- 
proved by holding them over a fire 
and shaking occasionally until the 
matted fibers are loosened, when the 
curl will be restored. 

When the curl has been entirely 
taken out by washing or soaking, it 
will be necessarj"^ to curl the fronds 
with the blunt edge of a knife or a 



piece of ivory. The curl will be more 
durable if the feather is held near 
the surface of a hot flatiron while 
curling. The feather should be bone 
dry. Do not take more than two or 
three fronds at a time, and draw them 
between the thumb and the blunt 
edge of a silver knife or ivory pajier 
cutter. Begin at the point of the 
feather, and work along the stem on 
both sides. After a little practice 
feathers may be curled to look as 
good as new. 

Swan's-down. — To clean swan's- 
down, first tack the strips on a piece 
of muslin and wash same as ostrich 
plumes. When partially dry, remove 
the muslin and rub the feather care- 
fully between the fingers to make it 
pliant. 

To Clean Fur. — The nature of fur 
is similar to that of wool, as both are 
animal fibers. Hence anything that 
will injure wool should not be used 
on fur of any description. Stains of 
grease or paint may be removed from 
fur hats or other articles by means of 
turpentine. Afterwards sponge with 
alcohol and dry. 

Or other furs may be^ cleaned by 
rubbing damp corn meal through them 
and allowing it to dry. Afterwards 
remove by shaking and brushing. The 
coarse furs, as bear, buffalo, etc., may 
be scrubbed with warm suds made of 
pure white soap and pure water, and 
their appearance will be very much 
improved by combing with a coarse 
comb. To improve the luster of furs, 
heat corn meal in an iron skillet to 
a rich brown but witliout burning. 
While still hot sprinkle it over the fur 
and rub with a flannel cloth. After- 
wards remove by shaking and brush- 
ing. 

To Clean Straw Hats. — ^The most 
delicate straw goods, as Milan, Leg- 
horn, and other straws, can be thor- 
oughly cleaned by mixing the juice 
of a lemon with a tablespoonful of 
powdered sulphur to form a thick 
paste. Apply this to the hat with a 
nailbrush or toothbrush, first remov- 
ing the band, and rub the paste thor- 
oughly into the straw. Afterwards 
rinse by dashing water upon it from 
a glass, but without soaking. Shape

the hat while still damp with a warm 
iron, pressing through a wet cloth 
until dry. 

Or press into shape and dry out of 
doors in the sun. 

Panama Hats. — Apply corn meal, 
slightly damp, with a fairly stiff nail- 
brush, changing the meal as it be- 
comes soiled. Brush off the excess 
of meal while still damp, dry the hat 
out of doors in the sun, and after- 
wards brush thoroughly. 

Or with a piece of flannel rub full- 
er's earth into the hat, cover quite 
thickly with it, and lay the hat away 
covered with a large piece of paper 
for four or five days. Remove the 
powder by brushing. 

Or apply peroxide of hydrogen with 
a flannel cloth. Repeat if necessary. 

To Size Straw Hats. — Beat up the 
white of an egg and apply to the hat 
after cleaning with a small camel's- 
hair brush or a sponge. 

BLEACHING VEGETABLE AND ANI- 
liIAL FIBERS 

Bleaching. — Bleaching is the proc- 
ess of treating materials in such a 
way as to whiten them. Bleaching is 
commonly applied to textile goods, as 
linen, cotton, wool, and silk; also to 
paper, pulp, straw, ivory, wax, and 
animal and vegetable oils. The oper- 
ation of bleaching textile fabrics con- 
sists of two parts: first, removing 
dirt and other impurities and all for- 
eign substances, and afterwards alter- 
ing the natural coloring matter of the 
fabric by chemicals having specific 
bleaching properties. The prelimi- 
nary operation of cleaning fabrics for 
bleaching is much the same as or- 
dinary washing in the domestic laun- 
dry. It depends upon the action of 
alkaline lyes and certain acids to dis- 
solve the resinous and f attj^ substances 
and other impurities that may either 
be natural or may be introduced into 
the fabrics in the process of manu- 
facture. 

The principal actual bleaching 
agents now employed are chlorine gas, 
usually combined with lime as chlor- 
ide of lime or bleaching powder; and 
sulphurous acid, usually as fumes of 



burning sulphur. Of these the chlor- 
ine compounds are the more power- 
ful. Like free alkali, however, they 
tend, after decomposing the coloring 
matter, to attack the fibers of the fab- 
ric itself and to injure them. Hence 
it is customary at the proper time to 
treat fabrics bleached by this agent 
with such substances as hyposulphite 
of soda to neutralize the excess of 
chlorine and prevent its further ac- 
tion. 

The various vegetable fibers, as cot- 
ton, flax, and hemp, are composed of 
cellulose, a substance that withstands 
to a great degree the action both of 
the acids and alkalies used in prelim- 
inary cleansing and the chlorine used 
as a bleaching agent. Animal fibers, 
on the other hand, as silk, wool, feath- 
ers, and the like, contain no cellulose 
and are readily destroyed by these 
agents. Hence they are commonly 
bleached by the action of sulphurous- 
acid gas. Various other chemicals 
have been recommended for bleach- 
ing, but none of them are commonly 
employed. 

Previous to the application of mod- 
ern chemistry (during the latter part 
of the eighteenth century), bleaching 
was done without the use of chlorine 
or sulphurous acid, by soaking and 
washing the articles alternately in al- 
kaline and acid liquids, exposing them 
on the grass to the action of air, light, 
and moisture, and sprinkling them 
with water several times a day. 

The exact nature of the change 
which takes place in bleaching is not 
known, but it is supposed to be 
brought about by the action of ozone, 
i.e., oxygen in its active form. This 
is set free during the process of 
bleaching with chlorine, and is also 
known to be present in small quan- 
tities in the atmosphere. The ancient 
method of first soaking and washing 
articles in lye and acids and after- 
wards exposing them to the action of 
the elements, is still practiced in many 
localities, but the modern methods of 
bleaching by chlorides and sulphurous 
acid can be practiced successfully in 
any household. 

to Bleach Brown Sheeting. — This 
is for an ordinary partly bleached 



768 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



cotton fabric. First wash with other 
white goods, and afterwards soak over 
night in strong soapsuds. Dissolve 2 
pounds of chloride of lime in a wash 
boiler containing 2^ pails of boiling 
water, or about ^ pound of chloride 
of lime to the gallon. Stir vigorously, 
and when cold pour through cheese 
cloth into a tub. Immerse the goods 
in this, stirring with a clothes stick 
for half an hour. Rinse thoroughly 
with cold water containing 1 ounce 
of hyposulphite of soda to the gal- 
lon. Finally rinse in bluing water 
and hang up to dry. Repeat if neces- 
sary. This will take mildew out of 
cotton or duck cloth, and restore the 
color of cotton goods that have been 
stored and yellowed. 

These methods are, of course, not 
suitable for more delicate cotton fab- 
rics. 

Bleaching with Sal Soda. — Wash- 
ing soda tends to bleach garments, 
but also injures them unless it is thor- 
oughly removed by rinsing. I*ut no 
more than one teaspoonful in a boil- 
erful of clothes. 

Bleaching: by Turpentine. — Dis- 
solve 1 teaspoonful of oil of turpen- 
tine and 3 teaspoonfuls of alcohol in 
the last rinsing water. 

To Bleach Wool with Oxalic Acid, 
— Dissolve 1 ounce of oxalic acid in 1 
gallon of boiling water; allow this to 
cool until it will bear the hands. Im- 
merse the articles and let them steep 
for an hour or more, rinse thoroughly, 
and dry. Repeat if necessary. 

To Bleach Flannel. — Dissolve 1 
ounce of powdered ammonia and 1 
oimce of salt in 2 quarts of water. 
Soak the articles in this for an hour 
or more. 

Or dissolve 2 ounces of bisulphite 
of soda in 1 gallon of water acid- 
ulated slightly with hydrochloric acid. 

To Bleach " Feathers. — Make a di- 
lute solution of bicarbonate of potas- 
sium, 1 part to 10 parts of water, 
sliglitly acidulated with nitric acid, 1 
fluid ounce to tfce gallon. Immerse 
the feathers for S or 4 hours. After- 
wards rinse in clear water, slightly 
acidulated with sulphuric acid, 1 fluid 
ounce to the gallon. 

To Bleach Straw Goods. — Sub- 



stances recommended for bleaching 
straw and straw goods, including 
straw hats, are sulphurous acid (i.e., 
fumes of burning sulphur), chlorine 
water (or chloride of lime), citric 
acid, and oxalic acid. Straw goods 
must be prepared for bleaching by 
scrubbing with lukewarm soap and 
water. 

The safest and best method of 
bleaching straw is perhaps by means 
of the fumes of burning sulphur. 
This method is employed by manufac- 
turers and milliners to bleach hats and 
bonnets. All bands and trimmings 
must first be removed. 

Or apply chlorine water with a 
sponge, cloth, or brush. Afterwards 
rinse in clear water containing hypo- 
sulphite of soda. 

Or make a paste of corn meal and 
a solution of oxalic acid in water. 
Spread this on the hat, allow it to 
dry, and remove by brushing. 

Or apply a strong solution of ox- 
alic acid and water, and rinse. 

Or immerse in a weak solution of 
chloride of lime — 2 ounces to 1 gal- 
lon of water. Rinse in water «oh- 
tainhig hyposulphite of soda. 

Or make a paste of flowers of sul- 
phur, or pulverized brimstone, with 
water. Cover with this, and expose 
to direct sunshine until dry. Repeat 
if necessary. Remove the sulphur by 
brushing. This is simple and success- 
ful. 

To Bleach Straw Braid. — Dissolve 
6 ounces of chloride of lime in a gal- 
lon of water. 

(1) Dip the goods in this for thir- 
ty minutes. 

(2) Dip in clear water acidulated 
with muriatic or sulphuric acid at the 
rate of 1 fluid ounce to the gallon. 

(3) Rinse in clear water contaiaing 
1 ounce of hyposulphite of soda to 
the gallon. 

Or dip in weak soapsuds and ex- 
pose to the fumes of burning sulphur. 

To Prevent White Goods from Fad- 
ingf. — If a suitable lawn or grassplot 
is available, spread white garments 
on the grass to dry during the warm 
months of the year. This is more con- 
venient than fastening to a line and 
keeps the garments always bleached. 



REMOVAL OF SPOTS AND STAINS 



769 



Faded articles may be bleached in 
this way by keeping them constantly 
moistened with clear water. 

To Bleach Unbleached Muslin. — 
Unbleached muslin is more durable 
than that which has already been 
bleached. Hence it pays to buy it 
by the piece and bleach it before mak- 
ing it up. Place on the stove a boil- 
er ful of strong bluing water, or use 
indigo instead of bluing. Unroll the 
cloth, put it in the boiler, and boil 
ten or twenty minutes. Hang it out 
on a clear, sunshiny day to drip; dry 
without wringing. When partially 
dry spread it on tlie grass to bleach. 

To Whiten Lace. — First wash in 
strong soapsuds, rinse and immerse 
in fresh suds, and expose to the sun. 

Or first wash and iron, stitch on 
cotton with basting thread, and soak 
for twenty minutes in olive oil. Af- 
terwards boil for twenty minutes in 
suds of Castile or other hard white 
soap and rinse in warm water. 

To Bleach Faded White Goods. — 
All cotton and linen fabrics and gar- 
ments that have been laundered tend 
to become yellow by the action of the 
alkali contained in the soap, which is 
imperfectly removed in rinsing. Gar- 
ments that have been laid away for a 



time, as summer dresses, will fre- 
quently come out in the spring much 
yellowed or faded. Put the faded ar- 
ticles in a separate boiler and add i 
pound of cream of tartar. Boil until 
the goods are clear. Wring out of 
bluing water and lay on the grass to 
dry. 

Or soak the garments over night in 
clear cold water, wring out, and soak 
for twenty-four hours in sour milk 
or buttermilk. If much yellowed, 
soak a third night in weak suds con- 
taining a little hard white soap and 
a tablespoonful of kerosene. After- 
wards boil in suds containing a table- 
spoonful of kerosene. Rinse in blu- 
ing water, and hang out to drip dry. 

Or boil the articles for fifteen or 
twenty minutes in strong soapsuds 
containing 1 tablespoonful of essence 
of turpentine and 3 tablespoonfuls 
of aqua ammonia, stirring occasion- 
ally. Care must be taken not to 'm- 
merse the arms in suds containing 
turpentine. Rinse the articles, using 
a clothes stick, in one or two clear 
waters, and wash and blue in the 
usual way. 

Washing soda should not be used 
for bleaching purposes, as it tends to 
rot the fabric.

In addition to the daily and weekly- 
routine of housework it is customary 
to give the house and its furnishings 
a thorough overhauling and renovat- 
ing once or twice a year, usually in 
the spring and fall. But this custom 
varies in different parts of the coun- 
try, and in cities is also quite differ- 
ent from what it is in rural neighbor- 
hoods. In cities, winter is the season 
when guests are received and most 
entertaining takes place; hence the 
fall house cleaning, as a preparation 
for the duties and festivities of the 
winter season, is likely to be the more 
important. 

In rural neighborhoods, however, 
summer is the period of greatest ac- 
tivity, and the spring house cleaning 
is usually the more thorough and 
painstaking. 

Spring House Cleaning. — Spring 
house cleaning should ordinarily be 
postponed until the weather has be-« 
come sufficiently settled, so that win- 
ter underwear, draperies, carpets, etc., 
may be stored away if desired, and so 
that tlie health of the household need 
not suffer by reason of the open win- 
dows and dampness attendant upon 



scrubbing floors and walls, white- 
washing, painting, and the like. Most 
women, after constant confinement 
during the winter months, are more 
or less run down in the spring, and 
the change from the bracing tem- 
perature of winter to the enervating 
warmth of the first spring days is 
likely to result in a lowering of tone 
that may expose them to serious mis- 
chief from overexertion. For these 
reasons there is a gradual change of 
sentiment in favor of making spring 
house cleaning a comparatively sim- 
ple affair, putting off the heavy work 
until the fall. But the spring house 
cleaning must be sufficiently thorough 
to renovate and protect all woolens, 
furs, and feathers from the ravages 
of moths, to remove heavy hangings 
and draperies, and everything that 
impedes the free circulation of air 
during the heated term. 

Plan of Campaign. — The work of 
house cleaning will be very much 
simplified by thinking out in advance 
a systematic plan of campaign. In a 
blank book make an inventory of the 
principal contents of each room. 
Measure the floors and the width and 



770

length of the window shades needed. 
Ascertain the number of yards of 
carpet or matting, the number of 
rolls of wall paper and the yards 
of border required for every room in 
the house, the amount of paint or 
stain needed for the various floors; 
also the size of the dining-room table- 
cloths, the length and width of sheets, 
and the size of pillow slips for dif- 
ferent pillows. Divide the book in 
sections, assign a number of pages to 
each room in the house, take accurate 
measurements, note them down, and 
preserve the book for future use. 
Consult it to determine what changes 
shall be made in the rooms, what ar- 
ticles shall be stored away, and what, 
if any, need to be repaired. Provide 
in advance the requisite amount of 
materials of all sorts, and have them 
at hand when the work begins. 

William Morris says: "Have noth- 
ing in your house that you do not 
know to be useful or believe to be 
beautiful." Hence before house clean- 
ing go through the house and criti- 
cally examine each object. Some of 
them may have passed their useful- 
ness, or your tastes may have changed 
and you may no longer regard them 
as beautiful. Then remove them with- 
out question. The art of successful 
living consists in getting along with as 
few articles of furniture as possible, 
rather than in accumulating many dif- 
ferent pieces. Remember that every 
additional object is an additional care. 
If you decide to retain an article, con- 
sider, if it is in order or not, if it can 
be put in order, and in that case 
whether it can be done at home. 
Gather up such pieces as you decide 
to repair and take them to the family 
workshop. 

Consider the discarded articles to 
see if they can be given away, sold, 
or used for fuel, and if not, throw 
them together to make a bonfire to 
celebrate with when the house clean- 
ing is finished. 

Rules for House Cleaning. — It is a 
good rule in house cleaning first to 
clean the cellar, because it is the most 
difBcult and often the most neglected 
part of the house. Afterwards begin 
with the attic and work down. 



Another good rule is to clean thor- 
oughly one room at a time, settling it 
as you go. 

Preparations for House Cleaning. 
— Experienced housewives arrange for 
house cleaning by preparing food in 
advance, boiling ham, baking beans, 
pies, bread, and cake, so as to be 
spared as far as possible the labor of 
cooking while house cleaning is go- 
ing on. 

While house cleaning, dress appro- 
priately for the work. Some house- 
keepers wear a divided skirt or bloom- 
ers made of four widths of heavy dark 
skirting. These are gathered into 
bands and buttoned about the ankles 
and waist. They are valuable pro- 
tectors for skirts, and facilitate climb- 
ing stej>-ladders, scrubbing floors, etc. 

Pull the sleeves up as far as you 
want them to go, and put elastic bands 
on the arms over the sleeves. Trim 
the finger nails as short as can be 
borne with comfort. This prevents 
their being broken or torn when 
obliged to work without gloves. Wear 
a dust cap, a big apron, and loose 
gloves. 

Half the disagreeableness of house 
cleaning is taken away by having a 
lotion to apply to parboiled and un- 
comfortable hands. Soak 2 or 3 
oimces of quince seed over night, strain 
through cheese cloth, and add 2 quarts 
of water and 2 ounces each of glyc- 
erin, boracic acid, and witch-hazel. 
This is one of the best of lotions. 

CLEANING THE CELLAR 

To Clean Cellars. — Begin to clean 
house with the cellar. It is a hard 
job, and you may be inclined to neg- 
lect it if you wait till the rest of the 
work has been done. No part of the 
house cleaning is so important from 
the standpoint of sanitary cleanliness 
or, because it is out of sight, more 
likely to be neglected. 

First sweep all dust and cobwebs 
from rafters and ceiling; sweep the 
shelves and wash them with strong 
suds or soda and water; remove, 
empty, and clean bins and barrels 
that have contained vegetables, and 
set them out of doors exposed directly 



772 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



to the air and sunlight. If the cellar 
admits of thorough drainage, wash 
down the ceilings, walls, and floor 
with a hose, or dash water on them 
from pails by means of a large dip- 
per. Open the bulkhead windows and 
sweep the floor, especially digging out 
the corners. Remove everything that 
is not necessary. The fewer oDJects 
to accumulate dust and to get in the 
way when cleaning, the better. 

Dissolve 2 pounds of copperas in 1 
gallon of water, and sprinkle the walls 
and floor with this solution by means 
of an old whisk broom or watering 
pot having a fine spray. This is a 
good disinfectant and assists In driv- 
ing away rats and other vermin. 

Finally whitewash the walls with an 
old whitewash brush or old broom, 
and use plenty of whitewash, to which 
add copperas at the rate of J pound 
to 1 poimd for each pailful. 

Vegetable Cellars. — If vegetables 
are kept in barrels or bins in the house 
cellar, they should be examined from 
time to time and picked over as Soon 
as they begin to rot. Leaves from 
cabbage heads, celery tops, and other 
vegetable stuff not wanted should be 
carefully removed before they begin 
to spoil. Decaying organic matter of 
any kind is the favorite breeding 
ground of the germs of typhoid fever, 
diptheria, and other contagious filth 
diseases, and decay is much assisted 
by dampness. Hence unless the cellar 
is perfectly dry, clean and free from 
rotten vegetables, those who are re- 
sponsible for its condition cannot in 
case of sickness have a clear con- 
science. An outbreak of black diph- 
theria which caused the death of five 
children in a single family was traced 
by a physician directly to some de- 
cayed vegetable matter on the cellar 
floor. 

Or make an outdoor vegetable cel- 
lar by sinking a strong cask or box 
in the ground below the frost line. 
Knock out the bottom and let the 
vegetables rest on the ground. Pro- 
vide a water-tight cover in two layers, 
with sawdust or charcoal between. Or 
throw over the top straw or hay. 
Thus cabbages, celery, and the like 
may be kept fresh in winter without 



danger of contaminating the air of the 
house. 

To Keep Cellars Warm. — Make a 
flour paste containing a strong glue 
size, and with a whitewash brush apply 
one or more layers of building paper, 
brown paper, or even newspapers to 
the rafters of the ceiling, and let it 
come down over the sills and aroimd 
the frames of windows to prevent 
draughts. The thicker the layer or 
layers of paper the better. This helps 
to keep the floors warm and to make 
the cellar frost p~oof. 

Care of Casks. — Keep an empty 
cask bimged up tight to keep it sweet. 

Tar casks slightly on the inside to 
assist in preserving salt meat. 

To sweeten a sour cask that has 
held pickles, vinegar, or wine, wash it 
with lime water, or throw in hot char- 
coal and ashes. Add water and let 
the cask soak. 

To remove must or other odors, 
wash with sulphuric acid and rinse 
with clear water, or whitewash with 
quicklime, or char the inside with a 
hot iron. In all cases rinse thoroughly 
with scalding water before using. 

To Eemove Dampness. — Place in 
the cellar a large open box or pan con- 
taining fresh lime. This will tend to 
dry and purify the air. Change the 
lime as fast as it becomes air-slaked. 

Whitewash for Cellars. — Slake 
enough lime for a pailful of white- 
wash. Mix half a pint of flour with 
cold water to a smooth paste, thin 
with scalding water, and boil until it 
thickens. Pour this boiling hot into 
the whitewash and stir vigorously. 

Or use boiled rice strained through 
cheese cloth. Add a teacupful of the 
strained rice to a pailful of slacked 
lime. 

Cover cellar walls twice a year or 
oftener with whitewash, to which add 
copperas at the rate of 2 pounds to 
the gallon. Apply whitewash freely, 
especially in out-of-the-way corners, 
removing all shelves, etc., so as to 
cover the entire surface of the walls. 

To Disinfect Cellars. — Close win- 
dows and other apertures and stuff 
the cracks with burlap. Burn a quan- 
tity of sulphur in a suitable receptacle 
on the cellar floor. An ordinary tin 



HOUSE CLEANING 



773 



pie plate covered with earth or sand 
may be used. Place on this live coals, 
on which sprinkle flowers of sulphur 
or brimstone. Take precautions to 
escape quickly so as not to breathe the 
fumes. 

To Prevent Dust in Cellars. — To 
minimize dust from furnaces, wet the 
ashes by throwing water on them from 
a dipper before taking them up. Or 
sprinkle them with water from a 
watering pot. Or sprinkle over them 
wet sawdust. 

This also prevents dust from rising 
into the upper rooms through the reg- 
isters. 

Bins for Cellars. — Have all bins 
for use in the cellar small enough to be 
freely movable. Or use barrels, and 
place bins and barrels on planks 
turned on edge to lift them above the 
cellar bottom. Make a sufficient num- 
ber of swinging shelves by tacking 
pieces of board to the rafters so as 
to project downward, and suspend 
shelves on these to hold canned pre- 
serves and other articles in place of 
having shelves on the walls. Keep the 
walls free to admit of comjilete white- 
washing. 

Pipes — To Prevent Trost. — Wrap 
exposed water pipe with bands of hay 
or straw twisted tight aroimd them, 
or cover with the asbestos tubes that 
are on the market for this purpose. 

Pumps — To Prevent Freezing^. — 
Remove the lower valve and drive a 
tack into the under side of it, project- 
ing in such a way that the valve can- 
not quite close. The pump will work 
as usual, but the water will gradually 
leak back into the well or cistern. 

Or have at hand a suitable hook of 
stout wire by which to lift the valve 
and let the water out of the pipe at 
night. 

Pipes — To Thaw. — If the pipe is 
accessible, wrap woolen cloths, as old 
pieces of underwear, carpet, and the 
like, thickly about it and poTir on 
boiling water. This holds the heat 
and melts the ice gradually. 

Or, if possible, pour boiling water 
containing as much salt as it will dis- 
solve into the pipe above the frozen 
part. This will settle and dissolve the 
ice. 



To Clear Drainpipes. — Flush the 
pipe once a week with boiling water 
containing sal soda. Rinse the kitchen 
sink daily with strong soda water. 

To Stop Leaks. — For cold-water 
pipes apply a thick paste of yellow 
soap and whiting mixed with a little 
water. Or, if the leak is too large, 
wrap the pipe tightly with a tarred 
cloth bandage. Melt the tar, and 
spread it over strong duck, canvas, or 
burlap cloth three or four inches wide. 
Begin to wind the bandage several 
inches from the leak and lap it one 
half or more upon itself at each round. 

For hot-water pipes mix iron filings 
with vinegar and sulphuric acid to a 
thick paste. Dry the pipe, fill the 
cracks with this mixture, and keep 
them dry until it sets. This is very 
durable. 

To Protect Lead Pipes. — Coat the 
inside of the pipe with sulphite of 
lead. This is insoluble and cannot be 
acted upon by water. To effect this 
fill the pipes with a warm concentrated 
solution of sulphide of potassium, and 
let stand fifteen or twenty minutes. 
Then rinse it out. The sulphide coat- 
ing will be formed by chemical action. 

To Clean Boilers. — To prevent scale 
forming on the inside of the boiler 
put into it two or three white oak 
saplings. These will be entirely dis- 
solved in three or four weeks, and the 
boiler will be clean. 

CLEANING THE ATTIC AND CLOS- 
ETS 

Closets and Drawers. — Choose a 
sunny day and empty the contents of 
bureau drawers, wardrobes, closets, 
and other storage places upon an old 
quilt or a sheet spread upon the lawn. 
Shake and dust these vigorously with 
a whisk broom, and sort them. Put 
in one pile ragged articles that are no 
longer useful except for carpet rags 
or to sell to the ragman; in another, 
those that are available for dusters, 
mops, dishcloths, and the like. Lay 
aside articles that need to be mended 
or renovated. Separate woolens and 
flannels, which require protection 
against moths, from cotton fabrics, 
wliicb are moth proof. After remov- 



774 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



ing with a whisk broom all traces of 
moths, hang the larger pieces on the 
line and leave the others out of doors 
exposed to direct sunshine. 

Meantime apply suitable moth de- 
stroyers to the insides of the drawers, 
wardrobes, and boxes that have been 
emptied. Take off the wall paper in 
the closets, as behind the wall paper 
is where you will find the nests of 
moths and other vermin. Wash the 
floors and walls with moth destroyers, 
and apply suitable preventives to 
cracks and openings. Wash out the 
insides of the drawers, and take them 
out to dry in the sun. 

Save fine towels that are too worn 
for further use and lay them in the 
bottom of the drawers, with lavender 
between the folds. 

While the clothes on the line are 
airing, pack flannels, furs, feathers, 
etc., in moth-proof paper bags or boxes 
to be stored away in the attic, and 
before the dew falls at night return 
cotton and other fabrics required for 
summer use to the drawers and ward- 
robes that have been cleansed and 
aired. 

Destroy with a hard heart every 
useless thing, and burn everything 
that you see no probability of need- 
ing in the near future. With the best 
of care odds and ends will accumu- 
late, and the labor of handling and 
preserving them in the hope of finding 
use for them by and by is often more 
than they are worth. 

But remember, if similar objects 
are classified and kept together, many 
uses may be found for them collec- 
tively. A lot of old stockings may be 
turned into a quilt. Old underwear 
is useful for dusters and many other 
purposes. Hence sort, classify, and 
arrange as much as you can, but when 
odds and ends are left over, throw 
them away. 

Drawers that Stick. — Now is the 
time to remedy the bureau drawer 
that sticks. If it is not quite dry 
when returned to its place, you will 
discover the spot that in damp weather 
is likely to swell and make trouble. 
Take a piece of common yellow soap, 
moisten it, and rub freely the parts 
which are too tight. Also soap the 
under part of the drawer where it 



slides. Or apply a tallow candle. Or 
rub the parts freely with bacon rind. 
But the soap is likely to effect the 
most permanent cure. 

CLEANING THE CHAMBERS 

To Clean Bedrooms. — Take down 
all curtains and draperies, if not al- 
ready removed, and carry them to the 
laimdry. Put the bedding on the line, 
shake and beat it, and leave it to air. 
Take the mattress out of doors, and 
beat and air it. 

If the bed spring is exposed and of 
metal, take it out of doors and turn 
the hose on it or dash water on it 
from a pail. Let it dry in the sun. 

If the bedstead is of wood, wash it 
with water containing borax or am- 
monia, but do not use washing soda 
or soap, as the former will spoil the 
paint and the latter will leave a dis- 
agreeable odor. 

If the bedstead is of metal, wipe 
it with a cloth dipped in kerosene. 
Or brush it over with gasoline and 
wipe off with a dry towel. 

Rub the paint of wooden bedsteads 
with a cloth dipped in parafiin. This 
both cleans and freshens it. 

Remove extra blankets and quilts 
to the laundry. 

Take up carpets and rugs to be 
beaten and shaken, or if there is mat- 
ting on the floor and it is not neces- 
sary to take it up, sprinkle dry salt 
over it and wipe with a cloth wrung 
out of warm water. 

If the floor is of hard wood, wash 
it with gasoline as you would with 
water, and ventilate thorouglilii before 
admitting a light. Polish with wax 
and suitable furniture polish. 

If the floor covering is drugget, 
scatter moist bran over it and let re- 
main several hours. When swept up 
the bran will take the dirt with it. 
Then scrub the drugget with hot water 
and ammonia by means of a stiff 
scrubbing brush, and afterwards wipe 
off with a soft cloth until the rinsing 
water is perfectly clear. 

To Renovate Metal Beds. — If the 
enamel is worn from a white enameled 
bed, go over it with an additional coat 
of white enamel, or obtain gilt enamel 
and gild it. This gives the appearance 



HOUSE CLEANING 



775 



of brass. The gilding wears better 
than white enamel and can be washed 
with gasoline. 

Or, if desired, give the white bed 
that needs renovating a coat of black 
enamel. 

Cotton Blankets. — In summer, cot- 
ton blankets and spreads, which are 
much cheaper than woolen ones, are 
to be preferred to woolen blankets or 
old-fashioned cotton quilts. They can 
be easily washed and are more sani- 
tary. The aim should be in summer 
to have the bed coverings as light and 
easy to handle as possible. 

Eiderdown. — With use an eider- 
doAvn quilt becomes compacted to- 
gether and loses its elasticity. Take 
it out of doors, shake and brush it, 
and expose it to sunshine for several 
hours. Spread it on the lawn and 
work over it with a stiff whisk broom 
to loosen the nap. Thus its elasticity 
may be restored, and it will again feel 
soft and downy. 

To Clean Mattresses — Stains on 
mattresses may be removed by cover- 
ing them with dry laundry starch and 
moistening this with enough soap or 
soap jelly (made by melting scraps 
of hard soap in about their own bulk 
of boiling water) to form a thin paste, 
which will dry on, but not soak through 
into the mattress. Let dry, and brush 
off with a stiff whisk broom. Repeat 
if necessarj'. Afterwards sponge with 
ammonia and water. 

To Clean Feather Pillows. — Feath- 
er pillows may be washed without re- 
moving the feathers by boiling them 
in borax water to which a small quan- 
tity of ammonia has been added. Use 
half a teacupful of borax to a boiler- 
ful of water, and add a tablespoonful 
of ammonia. Boll fifteen or twenty 
minutes. After removing the pillow 
from the boiler, scrub the tick, if badly 
stained, by laying it on a washboard 
and applying suds with a stiff brush. 
Rinse in two or three waters and 
hang on the line in a shady place to 
dry. Shake the pillow and change ends 
two or three times a day. Bring the 
pillows into the house before the dew 
falls or if it should come on to rain, as 
it takes a long time to dry pillows at 
best. This process makes the feath- 
ers light, flaky, and sweet smelling. 



Or, if you do not wish to wash the 
feathers, pass them into pillow covers 
and hang them on the line to air while 
the ticks are being washed. 

Or put the pillows out of doors in 
a drenching rain storm. Afterwards 
squeeze as much water out of them as 
possible and hang them up to dry in 
a shady place. 

To Mend Old Blankets. — To mend 
all breaks and tears in old blankets, 
cover both sides with cheese cloth. 
Tack all together with white or col- 
lored yarn, and thus make a light quilt 
superior to a comforter. Finish the 
edge by crocheting around all four 
sides. 

To Clean the Bathroom. — Thor- 
oughly wash down walls and floors, 
clean out the medicine closet, and 
throw away everything that is not 
likely to be used. Look over the 
shelves carefully for cracks and crev- 
ices which may give lodgment to ver- 
min, and wash them with strong soap 
and water. Clean the porcelain tub 
and basin with a cloth wet with kero- 
sene. Pour in kerosene, if necessary, 
and scrub with a whisk broom or fiber 
brush. Remove stains from porcelain 
with dilute muriatic acid (1 part of 
acid to 10 parts of water), applied 
by means of a cotton swab held in a 
cleft stick. 

Or rub on the stain a strong solu- 
tion of oxalic acid in water, but do 
not allow it to remain more than three 
minutes, or it will eat into the porce- 
lain. After the stain is removed ap- 
ply soap and water. 

Polish the metal work of faucets and 
pipes with a suitable cleaner. 

Or clean the bathtub, washbowl, etc., 
with gasoline and flannel. 

When painting the batliroom, if you 
wish the floor darker than the walls, 
without buying two shades of paint, 
get a light-colored paint, as lead color 
or light yellow, and after the walls 
are painted add to the remamder of 
the paint powdered burnt umber. Tliis 
will give to the floor a darker color of 
the same general tone. 

TO CLEAN FLOOR COVERINGS 

Floors in Summer. — Take up car- 
pets in the spring, beat and clean 



776 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



them, roll them up, protect them 
against moths, and, if desired, store 
them away until the fall house clean- 
ing. Fill the floor cracks, if any, with 
a suitable wood filler, and paint or 
stain the floor, or cover with matting 
during summer. This plan saves time 
and labor in the care of floors, and 
prevents much dust from sweeping 
during the hot months. If carpets can 
be replaced by hard-wood floors and 
rugs, so much the better, and taking 
up carpets during the summer time is 
a step in the right direction. Or, if 
preferred, the carpets may, of course, 
be returned to the floors after clean- 
ing. 

When taking up large rugs and art 
squares for the summer, roll them on 
sticks and sew them in canvas or bed 
ticking. These may be tied with strong 
cords and slung on hooks attached to 
the wall or ceiling in the attic or store- 
room. Thus thej' are well protected 
and out of the way. 

To Clean Carpets. — If a carpet is 
much soiled it may require washing 
or scouring after having been beaten. 
This may be done after the carpet has 
been laid on the floor. First remove 
stains and grease spots. Next wash, 
then, with a stiff bristle brush the size 
of a nailbrush, apply suds made with 
warm water and one of the following 
cleansing mixtures: 

Pure soapsuds made by dissolv- 
ing 1 bar of castile or other hard 
white soap in 2 gallons of water. 

Or one bar of hard white soap, 1 
tablespoonful each of borax, washing 
soda, fuller's earth, and salts of tar- 
tar. Cut the soap fine, mix the in- 
gredients in a kettle, add 1 gallon of 
boiling water, and stir until all are 
dissolved. 

Or 1 pint of ox gall dissolved in 1 
quart of cold water. Apply with a 
scrubbing brush until a lather is 
formed. Hub pure ox gall on soiled 
places, rinse, and dry as above. 

Have at hand a pail containing 
suds, another containing clear hot 
rinsing water, a stiff bristle brush, a 
large sponge, and a number of coarse 
porous cloths. Use as little water as 
possible. Take one breadth at a time 
and scrub what can be reached with- 
out moving. Rinse this section imme- 



diately with a spong wrung out of 
clear water and dry with a coarse 
cloth before proceeding to the next. 
Soap soiled spots with any good hard 
white soap dipped in water. Take 
about li yards at a time and work 
quickly, so that the water will not 
soak into the carpet. 

Finally, open the windows and allow 
the carpet to thoroughly dry before 
the room is used. Kindling a fire, if 
convenient, will assist in drying. 

Or ingrain carpets may be ripped 
into breadths and washed in the tub 
like other woolen goods with soap and 
water, or hung out on the line during 
a warm summer rain. 

Any of these methods is suitable for 
all forms of carpets or rugs of similar 
materials, as Oriental, Smyrna, and 
domestic rugs, art squares, and the 
like. 

Stair Carpets. — The better plan is 
to leave the stairs uncarpeted, but if 
a stair carpet is used the steps should 
be padded, especially over the edges, 
as otherwise the carpet will tend to 
wear along the edge. For this pur- 
pose use cotton batting or carpet felt 
or folded newspapers, tacking them 
at the back of each step and allowing 
them to fall two or three inches over 
the edge. This will also assist in 
deadening the sound of footsteps. 

To Freshen Faded Carpets. — After 
carpets have been cleaned and laid, 
the colors, if faded, may be freshened 
by sprinkling the carpet with strong 
salt water and sweeping hard. 

Or dampen a cloth with ammonia 
and rub over the surface of the car- 
pet. 

Or put i pint of turpentine in 
about 1^ gallons of water. Wring a 
cloth out of this solution and with it 
rub the carpet. 

Or go over the carpet with a broom 
or whisk broom moistened with gaso- 
line. 

Or put 1 cupful of cold tea and 1 
tablespoonful of turpentine in 9 
quarts of warm water. Dip the 
broom in this before sweeping. 

Or put 3 tablespoonfuls of turpen- 
tine and 4 of salt in 3 gallons of 
water, and moisten the broom with 
it. 
Or put 1 gill of ox gall in 1 gallon 



HOUSE CLEANING 



777 



of water and apply with a cloth 
wrung out so that it will not drip. 

Or dissolve 1 teaspoonful of alum 
in 1 gallon of water. 

Or any of the above may be ap- 
plied with a clean mop if care is 
taken to wring it out so that it will 
be damp rather than wet. The above 
will not only brighten and set the 
colors of a carpet, restore faded col- 
ors, and prevent fresh colors from 
fading, but will also act as pre- 
ventive against moths, and to some 
extent kill germs that may be pres- 
ent in the carpet. 

To Remove Grease from Carpets. — 
Substances recommended for taking 
grease out of a carpet are ammonia, 
saltpeter, ox gall, chloroform, ether, 
gasoline, fuller's earth, potter's clay, 
and various combinations of these. 

To Remove Grease. — Apply gaso- 
line, benzine, or naphtha with a 
sponge or stiff scrubbing brush. 

Or ammonia and water. Or one 
part common salt and 4 parts alco- 
hol. 

Or, if the grease is fresh, cover the 
spot with a layer of French chalk or 
fuller's earth. Lay a piece of brown 
paper or blotting paper upon the 
chalk, and place on it a hot flatiron. 
Change the iron occasionally. The 
grease will be melted and absorbed 
by the chalk and paper. 

Or apply pure ox gall with a stiff 
brush. 

Or apply chloroform or ether with 
a small brush. 

To Remove Ink Stains. — Cover 
quickly with dry salt or starch. Take 
this up with a spoon as it soaks up 
the ink, but do not rub or sweep it. 
It will take up the surplus and pre- 
vent the spot from spreading. Mois- 
ten with milk and continue to apply 
salt, starch, or similar absolvent un- 
til you remove all the Ink you can. 

Leave the spot covered with dry 
salt and test to see the kind of ink 
spilled. Put some of the ink on a 
piece of writing: paper and allow it 
to dry. Or, better, take some writ- 
ing made with the same ink that has 
stood several days and test that. 
First apply water, and if the ink 
runs, after having been thoroughly 
dried, it is probably stylographic ink, 



made of coal-tar products, eosin or 
nigrosine. In this case you must not 
use buttermilk or any acid. Use in- 
stead an alkali, as potash lye or sal 
soda, diluted with water. If the dry 
ink does not run when touched with 
water, it is probably an iron-gall ink 
or logwood ink with or without ani- 
line dyes. For these inks use dilute 
sulphuric acid, 1 part of acid to 10 
parts of water. If this takes out the 
color, restore it with aqua ammonia. 

Or cover with fresh salt or starch, 
or with a mixture of equal parts 
ground black pepper and salt, mois- 
ten with buttermilk, or salts of sor- 
rel, or tartaric acid, and let stand 
until dry. Repeat if necessary. 

If the colors fade, apply aqua am- 
monia. 

To Remove Kerosene. — To remove 
kerosene spilled on a carpet, cover 
the spot with blotting paper or brown 
paper and press with a hot iron. Re- 
peat if necessary. 

Or cover with corn meal, flour, 
starch, or salt, brush off as fast as the 
oil is absorbed and repeat, if neces- 
sary. 

To Remove Whitewash. — Scrub 
with soapsuds applied with a brush, 
and renew the color by applying 
vinegar, or other acid. 

To Remove Soot. — To remove soot 
which sometimes, in case of a defec- 
tive flue or turning up a lamp too 
high, fills a room and falls on the 
carpet, sprinkle the floor liberally 
with corn meal and sweep carefully a 
little at a time, taking up the sweep- 
ings as you go and before they are 
trodden on. Continue to apply corn 
meal and sweep until the soot is all 
removed. 

RUGS 

Care of Bugs. — Before sweeping, 
rugs should be removed from the 
room and thoroughly cleaned before 
they are returned to the floor. If 
rugs are caught by the ends and 
shaken they soon tear out and un- 
ravel. A better way is to hang them 
on a line and beat them with a car- 
pet beater. 

Or lay the rug on a clean floor and 
sprinkle table salt over it. Sweep it 



i78 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



hard with a broom until it is clean; 
turn it and sweep the other side the 
same way. 

If rugs must be beaten indoors lay 
a damp cloth over them. If they are 
very much soiled, rinse the cloth in 
hot water and repeat imtil the rug 
is clean. 

To Lay Rugs. — To prevent rugs 
from curling at the corners fasten 
under each corner a triangular bit of 
corrugated rubber. Let these extend 
8 or 9 inches along the rug. Bore sev- 
eral small holes in the rubber and sew 
through holes in the fabric. This 
not only keeps the rugs in place but 
makes them last longer. 

Or sew dress stays or whalebone 
under the corners to keep the rug 
from curling. 

Or turn the rug upside down and 
apply a liberal coat of cold flour 
paste with a brush to the corners and 
edges. Let the rug dry flat on its 
face, and when dry turn it over, and 
the weight of the paste will keep it 
in position. 

Care of Oriental Rugs. — Oriental 
rugs, if genuine, are in fast colors, 
and the top or right side is practically 
indestructible. The threads at the 
back, however, are very easily dam- 
aged. Hence Oriental rugs should 
always be beaten on the right side. 
When beaten they should be hung on 
the line or laid over grass or other 
soft surface. 

If much soiled, they may be washed 
or scrubbed by means of a stiff brush 
with soap bark dissolved in boiling 
water, and afterwards wiped off with 
a clean sponge and dried with a dry 
cloth. In winter lay an Oriental rug 
on the porch or other flat surface out 
of doors, sprinkle it with snow, and 
brush it off with a stiff broom or 
heavy whisk broom. 

To Brighten Colors. — Slightly mois- 
ten salt with kerosene. Sprinkle this 
over the rug and sweep it off. Kero- 
sene will leave no greasy effect. Ihe 
dirt will soon pass off and the col- 
ors will be freshened. 

Or substitute corn meal for salt. 

To Clean Oriental and Other Rugs. 
— Oriental rugs and other rugs hav- 
ing fast colors may be scrubbed with 
soap and water, or any of the above 



cleansing mixtures. Tack the rug 
on a bare floor, as a porch or piazza, 
and proceed as with a carpet. 

The following mixture is especially 
recommended for the best quality of 
rugs or carpets and other woolen fab- 
rics: dissolve 8 ounces of good white 
soap in the same quantity of boiling 
water; add 10 ounces of aqua am- 
monia, 5 ounces of alcohol, 5 ounces 
of glycerin, and ^ ounces of ether or 
chloroform. Keep in a fruit jar or 
large glass bottle and cork tightly. 
Use 1 tablespoonful of this prep- 
aration to a pailful of warm water, 
and apply with a stiff brush. Or for 
obstinate stains use a stronger solu- 
tion. 

To Wash Goatskin Rugs. — Wash 
goatskin rugs in gasoline, or in a 
mixture of gasoline and pure soap- 
suds made of hard white soap. 

To Repair a Smyrna Rug. — Shak- 
ing a Smyrna rug often ravels out the 
ends. Continue this raveling so as to 
expose two or tliree inches of the 
woolen filling. Tie and knot the 
loose threads to form a fringe. This 
will prevent additional raveling, and 
the fringe will stand as much wear as 
if new. Use the pattern as a guide, 
so as to make both ends uniform. 

To Patch Rugs and Carpets. — A 
hole in a rug or carpet maj' be patch- 
ed with the rubber mending tissue 
used for patching garments. Damp- 
en a piece of the same material or of 
burlap, lay over this a piece of the 
rubber mending tissue, and place it 
directly under the hole. Over all lay 
a piece of brown paper and press 
with a hot iron. Clip off any frayed 
edges with scissors or darn them with 
the ravelings. 

To Clean Sheepskin Rugs. — A 
sheepskin rug should never be im- 
mersed in water. The less the pelt 
side is wet the better. Hence tack 
the skin on a barrel, pelt side down, 
and apply hot soapsuds to the wool 
side with a stiff, clean scrubbing 
brush until it is clean. Rinse well by 
dashing cold water upon it, putting 
in the last water sufficient bluing to 
make the wool appear white, and 
leave it on the barrel to dry. This 
process does not expose the pelt to 
the rays of the sun, which would cause 



HOUSE CLEANING 



779 



it to become dry and hard. After 
the wool is dry go over it carefully 
with a clean currycomb or other 
coarse comb to prevent the wool from 
matting. It will thus be left fluffy 
and white as snow. 



MATTING 

Take up the matting, roll it up, and 
shake as much dust from it as pos- 
sible by jarring it on the floor. Un- 
roll it on a green lawn and apply the 
hose to it, or dash pails of water on 
it until it is thoroughly clean. This 
should be done on a hot day, and the 
matting should be thoroughly dried 
in the open air as quickly as possible. 
Take it in before the dew falls and air 
it again the second day if it does not 
quite dry the first. 

Or draw the matting over a table 
and apply moist corn meal with a 
scrubbing brush, thoroughly cleaning 
a section at a time. 

Or scrub with bran water. 

To Clean Matting on the Floor. — 
Matting should not be washed or 
scrubbed with soapy water, as damp- 
ness is injurious to it. It may be 
swept with a broom previously dipped 
in hot water, and afterwards gone 
over with a flannel cloth or sponge 
dipped in salt and water. The salt 
will freshen the colors and prevent 
the matting from turning yellow. It 
should be quickly dried with a second 
cloth before the water soaks in. 

Or sprinkle matting with bits of wet 
newspaper or similar substances, as 
with carpets, and sweep the way of 
the weave, but not across it. Wash 
with strong salt and water to 
strengthen the fibers. 

Or borax may be used in the water 
in place of salt. Afterwards, to give 
it a gloss and freshen the colors, it 
may be gone over with a cloth slightly 
moistened in fresh milk. 

Or wash with skim milk, rinse in 
warm water, and dry quickly with a 
coarse cloth. 

To Brighten Matting. — If light- 
colored mattings become stained and 
faded, wash with strong soda water. 
This Will give them a uniform solid 
cream color, harmonizing the differ- 
ent tints. 



Or with a water-color brush apply 
suitable dyestuff to the pattern to re- 
vive and restore it. 

To Remove Stains from Matting. — 
Matting that has been badly stained 
may be cleaned by washing with a 
solution of oxalic acid in the propor- 
tion of 1 ounce of acid to 1 pint of 
water. Apply to the stain with a stiff 
brush, use as little of the solution as 
possible, and afterwards wipe off with 
a dry cloth. Care must be taken to 
throw out the water immediately after 
using, as oxalic acid is a deadly -poi- 
son. 

To Remove Grease Spots, — Cover 
with French chalk and moisten with 
turpentine. Let this stand for a few 
days, and then scrub off with a stiff 
brush. 

To lay Matting. — Before laying 
matting, cover the floor with several 
thicknesses of old newspapers. Mat- 
ting is porous and lets the dust 
through. The paper catches this and 
admits of its being easily removed at 
house-cleaning time. Paper also pro- 
tects the matting from the sharp and 
uneven edges of the boards. 

Matting may be tacked down with 
ordinary carpet tacks or double- 
pointed brads. 

Or the different breadths may be 
sewed together with strong linen or 
cotton thread, using loose buttonhole 
stitches an inch or an inch and a half 
apart. To prevent tacking, the edges 
may be fastened with flour paste. 

Or, to avoid sewing, the edges of 
the several breadths may be pasted 
down. 

Pieces of matting may also be used 
as rugs on hard-wood floors, especial- 
ly for bedroom use in summer, by 
sewing the breadths together with 
buttonhole stitches and binding the 
cut ends with cotton braid or tape. 

OILCLOTH AND LINOLEUM 

To Clean Oilcloth. — Oilcloth should 
not be scrubbed with a stiff brush or 
mop, or saturated with water, nor 
should sal soda or other strong wash- 
ing compounds be used upon it. The 
surface is nothing but paint, and if 
it becomes soaked, especially with 
water containing strong soapsuds or 



780 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



washing compounds, it crumbles and 
quickly decays. 

To use a large sponge with luke- 
warm water containing skim milk is 
the best way to wash oilcloth. A very 
little hard white or yellow soap may 
be used if necessary. A sponge is 
excellent, since it leaves no lint, and 
does not admit of scrubbing the floor 
hard enough to crack or peel off the 
surface. 

After removing the dirt with skim 
milk and water, go over it a second 
time, rinsing with a sponge wrung out 
of clear warm water, and dry enough 
to take up nearly all of the moisture 
and admit of the floor drjing quickly. 

Or rub it over with a dry woolen 
cloth. 

Finally go over the surface with a 
rag dipped in boiled linseed oil or 
crude petroleum oil. This is very 
cheap, costing only 8 or 10 cents a 
quart, and a doth dipped in it will 
take up enough oil to go over the 
floor several times. After the cloth 
has been once saturated it will require 
but a small quantity of oil each time 
afterwards. 

Or use buttermilk to wash the oil- 
cloth. Afterwards rinse with a sponge 
dipped in clear water. 

To lay Oilcloths. — Oilcloths may 
be put down without the use of tacks 
by making a cooked paste of flour and 
water somewhat thicker than flour 
starch. Lay the oilcloth in place and 
apply a strip of paste about an inch 
wide first to the floor and afterwards 
to the edge of the oilcloth. Stand a 
heavy board edgewise over this strip 
until the oilcloth sticks. 

Or, if conditions are right, merely 
press the oilcloth down with the hands. 
The edges may be fastened to the 
floor in the same manner. 

Thus the oilcloth can be taken up 
when necessary without the injury 
caused by tacks and with little diffi- 
culty. 

Table Oilcloths.— The thin oilcloths 
used on kitchen tables, shelves, etc., 
may be cleaned in the same manner 
as the floor oilcloth. Do not use 
either soap or hot water, but moisten 
the rag slightly in kerosene. Rub the 
oilcloth until it is perfectly clean, 
wring the cloth out of hot water, and 



dip again in kerosene when necessary. 
Afterwards rub drv with a flannel 
cloth. 

Or wash with skimmed sweet milk 
or buttermilk, and rinse with a sponge 
and clear water. 

Polish with a little linseed oil or a 
cloth slightly dampened with new 
milk. 

To Wax Oilcloths and Linoleums. 
— First wash the floor as above and 
apply a thin coating of wax with a 
flannel cloth. 

Or use a floor oil mixed with wax. 

This gives a hard, smooth surface, 
which is easily wiped up and kept 
clean. 

To Remove Spots on Oilcloth. — 
Anything hot placed on oilcloth turns 
it white. To remove these spots rub 
with alcohol and polish with a drv 
cloth. 

To Brighten Oilcloth.— Put a little 
salt in the water in which oilcloth is 
washed. This will brighten and 
freslien the colors with which it is 
painted. 

HARD-WOOD nOORS 

Finish for Hard-wood Floors. — 
Rub down a new floor with sandpa- 
per, and polish with pumice mois- 
tened with a little water. Wash clean, 
let dry, fill the nail holes with putty, 
and if the grain of the wood is open, 
apply a suitable fiUer. Avoid a cheap 
filler, based on plaster of Paris and 
the like, as these are not durable. 
The best filler consists of ground 
quartz mixed with linseed oil about 
as thick as white-lead paint. The 
particles of quartz are angular and 
adhere to the grain of the wood. 
When nearly dry, or as soon as it be- 
gins to " flat," go over it witli a cloth 
or other polisher, and wipe clean all 
that will come off. Let stand a day 
or two and polish lightly with the 
finest grade of sandpaper. Wipe off 
the dust with a soft cloth and follow 
with two coats of the best quality of 
pure shellac. Avoid clieap shellac, as 
it is much less durable. This gives 
a high gloss. But if a dull finish is 
required, the shellac may be rubbed 
down by means of a piece of felt 
tacked over a flat surface as a block 



HOUSE CLEANING 



781 



of wood, with pumice stone mois- 
tened with cold-drawn linseed oil or 
olive oil. 

Or to refinish a hard-wood floor that 
has become defaced by age or wear, 
remove the previous finish by wash- 
ing the floor with a strong solution of 
sal soda, or, if necessary, caustic 
potash or soda lye. Or if this does 
not remove the spots, apply tur- 
pentine. After the wood has been 
perfectly cleaned, proceed as above. 

Wax for Hard-wood Floors. — Shel- 
lac alone makes a tough and dura- 
ble finish, but on account of its high 
gloss it readily mars and scratches. 
And these defects are very appar- 
ent. Moreover, a shellac surface can- 
not be touched up in spots because 
the brush marks will show. When de- 
faced, it must be refinished all over. 
Hence it is customary to follow the 
shellac with a protective coat of wax. 

Or wood may be oiled with cold- 
drawn linseed or other clear fixed 
oil, and a coat of wax applied directly 
to the oiled surface without shellac. 
This last is the usual custom abroad. 

A suitable wax properly applied 
gives a hard, glossy surface, is not 
sticky, and does not rub off. Scratches 
or mars on any part of the surface 
can be waxed over at any time, and 
the whole surface can be repolished 
frequently with a weighted brush. 
Floor oils, unless rubbed and pol- 
ished with great care, tend to stain 
skirts, rugs, and draperies. Hence 
wax is the most satisfactory of all 
floor dressings. 

To Wax Floors. — Apply, by means 
of a flannel cloth, beeswax thinned 
with turpentine and rub down with a 
weighted brush. This is a hard wax 
and difficult to apply without turpen- 
tine. But the turpentine quickly 
evaporates, and the wax then forms a 
very durable coating. 

Or as a substitute for beeswax, use 
parafiin wax, which is cheaper, soft 
and easy to apply, but less durable. 
ParaflSn is one of the petroleum 
products, and if not properly refined, 
tends to combine with the tannin of 
oak floors to form black petroleum 
stains, which are difficult to remove. 

Or fasten together four or more 
common red bricks. Lay one or 



more thicknesses of felt over the larg- 
est surface, surround the whole with 
flannel or other soft cloth, sew it on 
and attach an old broom handle with 
which to push or drag it over the 
floor. This is equally as effective as 
a weighted brush and costs nothing. 

Steel Wool for Waxed Floors. — 
To scour a hard-wood floor when 
scratched or marred, or to remove 
dirt that is ground in, use steel wool, 
which comes by the pound for this 
purpose. It can be used in the same 
fashion as cotton waste, and is a very 
effective scourer, which will not in- 
jure the finest surface. 

Polish for Waxed Floors. — Sub- 
stances recommended for polishing 
waxed floors are beeswax or rosin, 
thinned with turpentine, or paraffin 
wax. Stearin and even tallow can- 
dles are sometimes used for the pur- 
pose, but are much less suitable. 
Pure beeswax thinned with turpen- 
tine is the simplest and perhaps most 
desirable polish, but the following 
are recommended: 

Rub through a coarse grater 6^ 
pounds of beeswax. Add 3 pounds of 
pearlash and a little water. Bring to 
a boil and stir well until they cease to 
effervesce. Now stir in 3 pounds of 
dry yellow ocher and pour all into a 
tin pail, having a tight cover, in 
which to preserve it for use. Thin 
when required for use with boiling 
water to the consistency of cream, 
and apply while hot with a soft cloth. 
Polish with a weighted brush and 
wipe up with a coarse flannel. 

Or place in a tin pan 5 ounces 
of powdered rosin, 24 ounces of yel- 
low beeswax, and rub through a 
coarse grater. Add 1 pint of tur- 
pentine, and place the pan in a 
larger pan, surrounded by boiling 
water. This should be done at a dis- 
tance from a stove or open flame, and 
matches should not be lighted in the 
vicinity, as the turpentine gives off an 
inflammable gas. Stir until of a uni- 
form consistency, and pour into glass 
fruit jars or tin pails having tight 
covers to preserve for future use. 
When required for use, thin with 
turpentine to the consistency of 
cream, and a|i]ily as above. 

Spots on Waxed Floors. — Apply a 



782 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



little benzine or turpentine on a soft 
cloth to remove the wax. Rub clean 
with a dry cloth, and let the benzine 
or turpentine evaporate before wax- 
ing. 

To remove dirt that is ground in, 
scour with steel wool. After the spot 
has been removed, rub over the spot 
and adjacent surface with a cloth 
moistened in a solution of wax and 
turpentine or other polisher. Rub dry 
with a weighted brush to a fine pol- 
ish, otherwise it will be sticky. Avoid 
the use of water, as it will turn the 
wax white. Never use soft soap, sal 
soda, or other alkalies, as they tend to 
cut the oil in which the shellac is 
mixed, strike through and darken the 
floor beneath. 

Oil for Floors. — Do not use crude 
petroleum oil on oak or similar hard- 
wood floors. The crude petroleum 
contains a dyestuff which, with the 
addition of tannin, is the basis of 
black ink. All oak and some other 
hard woods contain tannin, which 
unites with certain constituents of 
crude oil and some other petroleum 
products to form in the fibers of the 
wood an insoluble black inky dye. 
Thus, in a short time the floor will be 
turned jet black, and its appearance 
ruined. To remove this stain, wash 
the floor with sal soda or caustic pot- 
ash lye, rinse, dry, and apply a solu- 
tion of 1 pound of oxalic acid dis- 
solved in 10 or 12 quarts of warm 
water. Wet the floor with this so- 
lution and let it dry without rins- 
ing. Let stand, if convenient, over 
night. But remember that oxalic 
acid is an active poison. Hence care 
must be taken to keep pets and chil- 
dren out of the room, and not to 
breatlie in the dust that rises from 
the dry crystals. Pour out the rins- 
ing water into a pit and cover it with 
earth. Oxalic acid will not injure 
shellac or interfere with any subse- 
quent treatment. 

Care of Hard-wood Floors. — To 
prevent furniture from scratching or 
marring hard-wood floors, get pieces 
of thick felt or soft rubber or obtain 
from a cobbler a sheet of rubber sole- 
ing. Cut these to the exact size of 
the table and chair feet. Cover them 
with glue, and when the glue becomes 



"tacky" lay them on. Put newspa- 
pers under the chairs to protect the 
floor until the glue is quite dry. The 
floor will be kept in much better con- 
dition of the members of the family 
wear rubber heels on their shoes. 

To Restore Wax Floors. — Old wax 
may be removed from a hard-wood 
floor by mixing equal quantities of 
sal soda and slaked lime, and using 
about 1 pound of the mixture to a 
pailful of water. Apply this with a 
mop, and afterwards scrub the floor 
with sand soap and water. If neces- 
sary apply dilute sulphuric acid, 1 
part of acid to 10 parts of water. 
Afterwards rinse in water containing 
a little ammonia and wipe dry. 

Remove any remaining traces of 
wax by means of turpentine. Other- 
wise shellac will not adhere. 

CLEANING AND REFINISHINQ 
SOFT WOOD FLOORS 

Cracks in Floors. — Place in a 
sauce pan 1 pound of pastry flour and 
rub up with a little cold water until 
free from lumps. Add 3 quarts of 
boiling water, place on the stove, 
bring to a boll, and stir in 1 table- 
spoonful of alum. Cut a quantity of 
newspaper into fine bits and stir it 
into this paste until it is about as 
thick as putty. Boil and stir until 
the mass is of a uniform consistency. 
Fill the cracks with this by means of 
a putty knife. Or a case knife with 
the point broken or filed square 
across will answer the purpose. Be 
sure to crowd it into the crack as deep 
as possible and finish level with the 
surface. This hardens like papier- 
mache, is of similar appearance and 
nearly as hard as the wood itself, and 
is very durable. 

Or make a strong glue size of 1 
ounce of glue to 16 ounces of water, 
and while boiling hot stir in bits of 
newspaper as above; or equal quanti- 
ties of fine sawdust and prejiared 
chalk; or plaster of Paris, and apply 
as above. Any of these may be mixed 
with coloring matter to match the 
boards. 

Or cracks may be filled with putty. 
But this is not equally good, since 
with shellac or varnish it shows 



HOUSE CLEANING 



783 



through, and is of a slightly different 
color than the wood. 

Oil for Floors. — To oil floors, use 
linseed oil boiled. First remove all 
previous wax, paint, or varnish, wash 
the floor clean and let it dry. Ap- 
ply the oil with a paint brush, keep- 
ing it at the boiling point by means 
of a small alcohol stove or other- 
wise. 

One or two coats of oil, applied 
twice a year, will greatly improve 
kitchen or other rough wood floors, 
and the addition of a coat of wax will 
improve the finish and prevent the 
oil from soiling anything. 

An oiled floor should be cared for in 
the same manner as a waxed floor, 
without the use of soap, wash- 
ing powder, or an alkali. 

To Color Floor Oil. — Add 1/3 table- 
spoonful of burnt umber to each 
quart of oil to darken it. Or an equal 
amount of yellow ocher to make it 
light. 

Stains for Floors. — Ordinary oil 
and lead paints are not suitable for 
floors for two reasons: they tend to 
soften the wood, and also to crack, 
chip, and peel, or wear away in spots 
that are most trodden, so as to give 
the floor an uneven appearance. 
Hence suitable stains (which are the 
same colored pigments that are used 
in paints thinned with oils so as to 
penetrate into the fiber of the wood, 
but without lead) are better for this 
purpose. 

Or the pigment may be applied in 
a vehicle of glue size. 

Or various dyestuffs, as aniline and 
other dyes, may be applied, either 
dissolved in water or oil. 

But the followina: will be found the 
most generally satisfactory: 

For a floor 16 feet square, or ap- 
proximately 250 square feet of floor 
space, one heavy or two thin coats, 
mix 2 quarts of cold-drawn linseed oil 
and 1 quart of turpentine, to which 
add 4 ounces of Japan dryer. Stir in 
about 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of 
any desired pigment or mixture of 
pigment, or enough to bring the whole 
to about the consistency of ordinary 
lead and oil paint, and bring to a boil 
over a slow fire. Dissolve with gen- 
tle heat 2 or 3 ounces of yellow bees- 



wax in a little turpentine, taking care 
that the turpentine does not catch fire. 
Stir in the wax, remove from the fire, 
and when about lukewarm, thin with 
turpentine to about the consistency of 
new milk. Try the stain on a piece 
of the same kind of wood as the 
floor before using, to see if the color 
is right. Soft wood like pine will 
absorb more of the color than hard 
wood like maple. Hence it is im- 
portant to thin the stain to the 
right consistency to get the desired 
effect. Take care to apply the stain 
evenly with the brush, as in painting, 
and lay it on freely the way of the 
grain, rather than against it. The 
addition of turpentine causes the 
stain to strike into the wood. 

Or in place of cold-drawn linseed 
oil with turpentine, use boiled linseed 
oil mixed with any desired pigment, 
and apply boiling hot. Keep the oil 
at the boiling point by means of an 
alcohol stove or otherwise. 

Or dissolve 3 ounces of glue in 2^ 
quarts of soft water. Remove from 
the stove and stir in 2 pounds of yel- 
low ocher. Apply with a paint brush 
while hot, and follow with a coat of 
boiled linseed oil. Let stand over 
night before walking on it. 

Or to give the floor a deep black 
like ebony, boil 1 pound of logwood 
chips in 2 quarts of water down to 

1 quart, and apply one or two coats 
with a paint brush. When dry, fol- 
low with a strong solution of sul- 
phate of iron in water. Afterwards, 
when dry, apply a thin coat of boiled 
linseed oil, wax, and polish. 

Or to 6 quarts of caustic-potash 
lye made from wood ashes add 1 
pound of copperas more or less, to 
give a light or dark oak shade as de- 
sired, and apply one or more coats 
with a brush. When dry, varnish the 
floor, wax, and polish. 

Pigment for Stains. — Add any of 
the following pigments in the form 
of dry powder at the rate of about 

2 heaping tablespoonfuls to the gal- 
lon of stain, to obtain the colors 
mentioned : 

To imitate mahogany, use burnt 
sienna. For black walnut, burnt um- 
ber or Vandyke brown. For cherry, 
burnt sienna mixed with iron oxide. 



784 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



For yellow, raw sienna, yellow ocher, 
or raw umber. Or any of the above 
may be combined freely to form 
tints or shades as desired. Experi- 
ments may be made by adding the 
pigments a little at a time and test- 
ing the color from time to time on a 
piece of board of the same kind of 
wood as the floor is made of. 

Varnish for Stained Floors. — 
Place in a 6-quart saucepan about 
10 oimces of linseed oil. Bring to a 
boil over a brisk fire, stirring con- 
stantly, and stir in 2 ounces of 
pure white borate of manganese in 
very fine powder. Heat separately 8 
pounds of linseed oil to the boiling 
point, and add it to the first solution 
in a thin stream, stirring constantly. 
Continue to heat the mixture as hot 
as possible without burning. Stir con- 
stantly and boil for half an hour. 
Take off the stove and strain through 
cheese cloth. Apply one or two coats 
while hot, and follow when dry with 
shellac or hard white copal varnish. 

Or oil stains may be followed by 
ordinary shellac varnish with the ad- 
dition of 4 ounces of cold-drawn lin- 
seed oil to each quart of varnish. One 
quart of varnish will be required for 
a floor 12 by 12 or about 150 square 
feet of surface. 

To Clean Stained Floors. — Obtain 
a quantity of coarse sawdust of non- 
resinous wood free from dust or 
dirt, and store it in a bin where it 
will be kept dry and clean. Scatter 
this sawdust freely over the floor and 
scrub the floor with it by means of 
a stiff scrubbing brush, as if using 
water. The sawdust may then be 
swept up and burned, and the floor 
wiped up with a soft cloth drawn over 
the head of a broom. This is suitable 
treatment for unpainted, waxed, or 
varnished floors if much dirt has been 
tracked in upon them. 

Or wring a mop out of kerosene 
oil and wipe up with this. Use about 
1 quart for an ordinary floor. Use 
for this purpose only refined kero- 
sene of the best quality, but do not 
use it freely on oak, as it tends to 
darken the wood. 

Care of Oil-stained Floors. — An 
oil-stained floor will not soak up 
grease or show spots like a bare 



floor, and will not require scouring. 
It may be wiped up by means of a 
mop wrung out in clear warm water, 
but do not use soft soap, washing 
powders, or any alkali on an oiled 
surface, as the alkali will dissolve the 
oil. Oil-stained floors may be pol- 
ished with wax or turpentine if de- 
sired. 

Or the oil stain may be followed by 
one or more coats of hard white copal 
or shellac varnish before the wax is 
added. 

To Clean Wood Floors. — Deter- 
gents recommended for cleaning 
kitchen floors and other coarse and 
unpainted woodwork are caustic pot- 
ash and soda lyes, soft soap, sand, 
lime, chloride of lime, ammonia, kero- 
sene, gasoline, and various mixtures 
of these. 

To scrub a wood floor, first take up 
grease spots. Then apply hot soap- 
suds with a scrubbing brush or mop, 
rinse with clear water, and wipe dry. 
Clean and dry a small section of the 
floor at a time and change the water 
frequently. 

Mops and Pails. — A strong pail 
fitted with a small wringer such as is 
used by janitors of large buildings 
will be found a great convenience. To 
save stooping, place this on a chair. 
Or mount a square board on castors 
and set the scrubbing pail on this. 
Use two mops of soft woolen rags, 
one of small size for washing the floor, 
and a larger one for wiping dry. 

Unpainted Floors. — An unpainted 
board floor, " white enough to eat 
off," as the homely saying goes, is 
very attractive, but requires a good 
deal of hard work. Our grandmoth- 
ers used to cover unpainted floors 
with sand. Thus the family, in the 
process of walking to and fro, kept 
the floor boards scoured to a snowy 
whiteness. Ihis is still a good way 
to whiten an unpainted board floor. 
Sprinkle the floor freely with clean 
white sand, and if there is no objec- 
tion, let it remain a few days. Or 
the floor may be scoured with dry 
sand by means of a stiff scrubbing 
brush. The best sand for this pur- 
pose is obtained by purchasing mar- 
ble clippings and heating them to 
redness in an iron kettle or other- 



HOUSE CLEANING 



785 



wise. When cold, they may be read- 
ily pulverized. 

Or ])repare a scouring mixture 
composed of 3 parts of sand, 2 parts 
of soft soap or soap jelly, and 1 part 
of lime. Apply with a stiff scrubbing 
brush, rinse with clear water, and rub 
dry with a flannel cloth. This has 
the additional advantage that it kills 
vermin. 

Or moisten a thin flannel cloth with 
kerosene, draw it over the head of a 
broom, and wipe up the floor each 
day with this. It removes dust and 
grease, and thus obviates the necessity 
for scrubbing oftener than once every 
two or three weeks. 

Or scatter sand over the floor and 
with an old whisk broom sprinkle 
upon the sand a solution of 1 pound 
of caustic potash or soda in 1 quart 
of water. Scrub with hot water and 
scrubbing brush, or mop, rinse, and 
dry. 

Or apply soapsuds and sal soda. 

Or add 1 tablespoonful of ammonia 
to a pail of water. 

Or, for musty floors, use chloride 
of lime, i pound to a pailful of water. 

Spots and Stains. — Scatter ground 
quartz-stone sand, or marble sand, 
over the stain. Pour over it a strong 
solution of caustic soda or potash at 
the rate of 1 pound to a pint of wa- 
ter and scrub by means of a stiff 
bristle brush wet in soapsuds. 

Or scour with a mixture of 1 part 
chloride of lime and 3 parts of sand. 
This will bleach the boards and de- 
stroy vermin. 

To remove whitewash, scrub with 
vinegar and water. 

To remove mold, first scour with 
soap and sand, then sprinkle with 
chloride of lime. Pour on boiling 
water and scrub by means of a stiff 
brush. 

To Remove Grease. — To prevent 
hot grease from sinking into the 
floor, sop cold water on it with a 
cloth to harden it. Scrape off what 
is on the surface with a dull knife. 
Remove the stain with a wet cloth 
sprinkled with baking soda. 

Or kill the grease by pouring tur- 
pentine over it and then scour as 
above. 

Or sponge with gasoline, but take 



care not to work near a lighted 
stove. Greasy walls and other wood- 
work may first be rubbed with gaso- 
line to kill the grease before washing 
them. 

Or wash greasy paint with fresh 
slaked lime diluted to the consist- 
ency of milk. Let dry and rub off. 
Repeat if necessary. 

Or sprinkle a grease spot with 
whiting, fuller's earth, or laundry 
starch. Lay blotting paper or brown 
paper over it aand over that a hot 
flatiron. Let stand until cold. Re- 
peat if necessary. 

Or apply a paste of wood ashes and 
soap. Let stand over night, and wash 
off with soda and water. Repeat if 
necessary. 

Or apply sand mixed with chlo- 
ride of lime, and scrub with a stiff 
brush. 

To Remove Ink Spots from Floors. 
— If the ink contains coal-tar prod- 
ucts, eosin or nigrosine, use a strong 
alkali, as caustic soda or potash; 
otherwise use a strong acid, as 
muriatic acid, vinegar, salts of 
lemon, or oxalic acid diluted with wa- 
ter. 

Dissolve a solution of 1 part of ox- 
alic acid and 10 parts of boiling water. 
Apply by means of a cloth, and after- 
wards rinse with water containing 
sal soda to neutralize the acid. 

Or cover the ink spots with a paste 
of chloride of lime moistened with 
water. 

Or scour out the ink spots with a 
solution of 1 part of sulphuric acid 
in 20 parts of water, applied by 
means of a stiff scrubbing brush with 
sand and water. Rinse with a 
strong solution of ammonia or sal 
soda in water. 

CLEANING PAINT 

To Clean Paint. — To clean paint 
and varnish, whiting, fuller's earth, 
cold tea, wood ashes, kerosene, soda, 
ammonia, turpentine, and bran wa- 
ter are all recommended. Do not 
use much soap or washing powders 
containing free alkali to clean paint, 
nor any soap at all to clean varnish. 
Soap tends to streak or to remove 
paint. Keep the water warm, but 



786 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



not hot, and change frequently. Use 
a flannel cloth or chamois, as cotton 
and similar goods leave lint, which 
sticks to the paint. 

Or use outing flannel or flannel- 
ette. 

Old underwear makes good wash 
cloths for woodwork. Moisture is 
good for woodwork, and hence it 
should be wiped off once a week with 
a damp cloth, and will be improved 
by a thorough washing several times 
a year. If woodwork is too dry, it 
tends to shrink. Hence it is impor- 
tant to wash woodwork for the sake 
of moisture as well as for the sake 
of cleanliness. Beware of recipes 
which call for soft soap, lye, and 
strong soapsuds to clean paint. They 
will remove the dirt, but in time will 
take the paint with it. 

To Clean White Paint and Var- 
nish. — To clean white and other 
delicate colored paints and varnish, 
moisten chamois or flannel cloth 
with warm water, dip it in whiting 
or fuller's earth, and rub over the 
surface gently. This will remove the 
dirt and leave the paint as bright as 
new. Rinse with clear water and 
dry with a soft cloth. 

Fuller's earth is an excellent sub- 
stitute for soap. 

Or, for white paint, moisten a 
cloth in milk, dip it in whiting or 
fuller's earth, and apply. 

Or, to wash varnish or delicate 
paint, use cold tea, with or without 
whiting or fuller's earth. Apply 
with flannel and rub until clean. 

Or boil a pound of bran in a gal- 
lon of water and with it wash the 
paint. This will thoroughly clean 
the most delicate surfaces without 
injuring them. 

To Clean Coarse Paint. — First go 
over it with a cloth dipped in kero- 
sene to loosen the smoke and grime. 
Then rinse with i teacupful of kero- 
sene in 1 gallon of water, and wipe 
dry with a soft cloth. 

Or mix baking soda with water to 
form a thin paste. Smear the 
paint with this and wipe off with a 
cloth wrung out of clear warm wa- 
ter. Cover a small surface at a 
time and remove the soda before it 
dries. 



Or wet a cloth in strong soda and 
water, wash the paint quickly, rinse 
with clear water, and dry at once. 
This should not be used on varnish or 
delicate paint. The cloth should be 
damp rather than wet. 

Or mix 1 tablespoonful of am- 
monia with 1 quart or more of warm 
water for coarse or dirty woodwork. 
This saves labor and takes off the 
dirt, but should not be used on var- 
nish or delicate painted surfaces. 

Or dissolve 1 bar of hard white 
soap in 1 gallon of boiling water. 
Add 1 tablespoonful each of sal soda 
and saltpeter and 2 tablespoonfuls 
of ammonia. Bottle and cork tightly 
for future use. 

Or mix 1 quart of sweet oil with 

1 pint of turpentine and apply. 

To Polish Woodwork. — Mix equal 
parts of lard oil and turpentine, or 

2 parts of sweet oil to 1 part of tur- 
pentine, and rub the woodwork light- 
ly with a cloth saturated with the 
mixture. This may be used on any 
painted surface after washing. 

To Remove Smoke Stains. — To re- 
move smoke stains, wet a cloth, dip 
it into very fine sifted wood or coal 
ashes, and scour the paint clean. 

To Remove Match Stains. — To re- 
move the marks left by scratching 
matches on paint, rub gently with a 
slice of fresh lemon and rinse with 
clear water, using a soft cloth. 

To Remove Paint. — Detergents 
recommended for removing paint 
from woodwork are turpentine, ben- 
zine, gasoline, chloroform, oxalic 
acid, ether, alcohol, caustic potash, 
sal soda, and quicklime. When 
paint begins to check, it indicates 
that its ingredients were impure, and 
it must be removed. 

To soften the paint, apply with a 
paint brush wood alcohol, spirits of 
turpentine, benzine, or a strong so- 
lution of equal parts of oxalic acid 
and water. Any of these will soften 
the paint so that it can be wiped off 
with a coarse cloth or scrubbed away. 
Repeat as often as necessary. 

Or, if these do not soften the paint, 
apply chloroform, either alone or 
mixed with an equal quantity of 
spirits of ammonia. Moisten only a 
small surface, and scrape off the 



HOUSE CLEANING 



787 



paint while moist before proceeding 
farther. 

Or slalie 3 pounds of quicklime, 
add 1 pound of potash, and dilute 
with water to the consistency of 
cream. Apply with a paint brush 
and let stand over night. Remove 
by washing the surface with a flan- 
nel cloth or mop dipped in a strong 
solution of sal soda and ammonia. 

Or scrub with a stifif scrubbing 
brush. 

Or dissolve a bar of hard yel- 
low soap in twice its bulk of water. 
When cool, add 1 tablespoonful of 
potash lye and | cupful of kerosene. 
Before the mixture sets, apply to 
the woodwork with a paint brush. 
After 24 hours apply a strong so- 
lution of sal soda with a scrubbing 
brush. 

Or paint may be burned off by go- 
ing over the surface with a flat flame 
produced by a regular lamp made 
for that purpose, called a " paint 
burner." 

Or apply a red-hot iron. Take 
care to remove the paint as soon as 
It is soft and before the wood is 
charred or burned. 

To Remove Putty. — Go over the 
surface of the putty with a red-hot 
poker or other iron, taking care not 
to burn or char the woodwork. The 
putty can then be peeled off with a 
blunt knife blade. 

Or with a brush apply a paste 
made of soap jelly containing caus- 
tic potash or soda. 

Or apply dilute sulphuric, nitric, 
or muriatic acid with a brush. But 
if any of these soaks into the wood- 
work, it tends to rot the frames. 
Hence burning is the better method. 

WHITEWASHING 

Before applying whitewash, go 
over the wall or ceiling with a brush 
or dust cloth to remove dust, and 
wash with clear water. Fill all 
cracks and broken places with new 
plaster. Cut away the edges of 
broken places to make a square edge. 
Fill small cracks and breaks with 
plaster of Paris. Do not apply 
whitewash until the surface is quite 
dry. Give two or more coats as 
needed. 



To Prepare Whitewash. — The 
principal ingredients in various 
kinds of whitewash are slaked lime, 
whiting, Paris white or sulphate of 
baryta, oxide and sulphate of zinc, 
alum, sugar, rice and wheat flour, 
and glue mixed with milk or water. 
These ingredients are used in various 
combinations. The addition of a little 
bluing will make a clearer white, and 
a small amount of salt assists by mak- 
ing the whitewash stick better. 

The following mixtures are recom- 
mended : 

Slake a sufficient amount of lime 
in water to make a pailful of white- 
wash, and while still hot stir in a 
pint of flour boiled with water to 
form a thin cooked starch. Stir well 
and dilute with hot water to the 
right consistency. 

Or prepare a wash of slaked lime 
in a pail or tub and strain through 
cheese cloth. Mix 4 ounces of whit- 
ing or pulverized burnt alum, 2 
pounds of sugar, and 2 quarts of 
rice flour with hot water and bring 
to a boil, stirring constantly. Add 
this mixture to 1 pailful of sifted 
lime wash. Add also 1 pound of 
best white glue dissolved in boiling 
water over a slow fire. This is a 
very brilliant and durable wash and 
will last for many years. 

Or slake 8 quarts of lime, and add 
1 pound of sulphate of zinc and i 
pound of common salt dissolved in 
water. This is a hard, firm wash 
that will not crack. 

Or mix 6 pounds of Paris white 
with cold water to form a paste, and 
dilute with hot water to the consist- 
ency of milk. Stir in 4 ounces of the 
best white glue dissolved in boiling 
water over a slow fire. This is a 
cheap wash and gives a fine, brilliant 
surface. 

To Color Whitewash. — For a fine 
clear white, add a little bluing. 

For a reddish pink, add Spanish 
brown. 

For a red stone color, mix com- 
mon clay with Spanish brown. 

For yellow, add yellow ocher (or 
chrome yellow, which goes farther 
and makes a better shade). 

For gray or lead color, add lamp- 
black. 



788 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



For cream color, yellow ocher. 

For stone color, -2 parts each of 
limber and lampblack. 

For fawn color, 4 parts of umber, 
2 parts of Indian red, and 1 part of 
lampblack. 

Do not use green with white- 
wash. 

The quantity of coloring matter 
required depends upon the amount 
of whitewash and the warmth of the 
tint desired, and must be determined 
by experiment, but approximately 
two or three pounds to a pailful of 
wash will be advisable. 

Whitewash for Outdoor TJse. — To 
make a good whitewash for fences, 
outbuildings, barns, stucco, and other 
surfaces exposed to the weather, 
slake 12 quarts of lime in a tight 
cask or barrel. Cover with canvas 
to keep in the steam. Strain through 
a large piece of cheese cloth or a 
fine sieve and add 3 quarts of coarse 
salt and 2 gallons of water. Bring 
this to a boil and skim off any im- 
purities. Stir in 2 pounds of potash, 
8 quarts of fine sand, and coloring 
matter as desired. This wash may 
be applied to wood, brick, or stone, 
looks as good as paint, and is weath- 
erproof, fireproof, and very durable. 
It is an excellent preservative for 
shingle roofs and walls. 

Or slake 9 quarts of lime in a 
tight cask or barrel, strain, and add 
J quarts of salt dissolved in hot wa- 
ter. Add boiling starch made of 2 
pounds of rich flour. First mix the 
starch with cold water to a thin 
paste, dilute with hot water, and boil 
the mixture 15 minutes. Stir in 
while boiling hot. Then stir in 4 
ounces of powdered whiting and 8 
oimces of best white glue dissolved 
in hot water over a slow fire. Dilute 
with 3 gallons of hot water, stir vig- 
orously, cover, and let stand 3 or 4 
days. This mixture should cover 24 
to 36 square yards of wood, brick, 
or stone. It may be used instead 
of oil paints, is much cheai^er, and 
will last for years. It should be ap- 
plied hot, which may be done by us- 
ing a portable furnace or by sus- 
pending a kettle over a camp fire by 
means of three poles in the form of 
a tripod. 



Or slake 8 quarts of lime, strain, 
and add 1 pound of dissolved glue 
and 1 or 2 quarts of boiled linseed 
oil. Dilute with water. 

Or dissolve in hot water 4 quarts 
of water lime, 4 quarts of fresh- 
slaked lime, 4 pounds of powdered 
yellow ocher, and 4 pounds of burnt 
umber. This gives a rich cream col- 
or for fences, outhouses, and barns. 

Wash for Bricks. — To make a 
wash for red brick walls, dissolve 9 
ounces of glue in 1 gallon of water 
over a slow fire. Soaking the glue 
for a day or two beforehand will 
make it dissolve more quickly. 
Bring the glue to a boil and stir in 1 
tablespoonful of powdered alum, i 
pound of Venetian red, and 1 pound 
of Spanish brown. Or vary these 
proportions according to taste. Mix 
and apply with a brush. 

To Prepare Calcimine. — Dissolve 
with boiling water in separate ket- 
tles 10 pounds of Spanish whiting, 
8 ounces of white glue, and 8 ounces 
of powdered alum. Use in each case 
enough water to make a thin cream. 
Pour together, stirring vigorously, 
strain through cheese cloth, and add 
1 teaspoonful of bluing. Apply 
while warm. Add coloring matter 
to suit, and dilute with soap jelly to 
the right consistency. Remove pa- 
per, if any, wash off old calcimine or 
lime, fill holes or cracks with plaster 
of Paris, and apply a sizing of glue 
or shellac. 

Mix calcimine with any coloring 
matter desired and apjily the same as 
whitewash. 

Blue Wash for Walls and Ceil- 
ings. — Dissolve 1 pound of blue vit- 
riol and 8 oimces of whiting in 3 
quarts of water. Boil with gentle 
heat 2 or 3 hours, stirring frequently. 
Remove from the fire, stir, and al- 
low to cool. Pour the liquor from 
the sediment, mix the latter with 1 
ounce of common glue dissolved in 
1 gallon of water, and apply with a 
brush. 

PAPER HANGING 

To Remove Wall Paper.— To pre- 
pare a wall for fresh treatment, 
whether by painting, calciniining, or 



HOUSE CLEANING 



789 



hanging fresh paper, first remove 
any paper that may be on the walls. 
Never lay one paper over another. 
The germ of disease, eggs of ver- 
min, and other obnoxious matter are 
not to be gotten rid of by this proc- 
ess. Wet the walls with boiling wa- 
ter applied with a whitewash brush, 
and remove the paper with a hand 
scraper or a large case knife or 
wide-bladed putty knife. Do not al- 
low the scrapings to harden on the 
floor, as when dry they are very dif- 
ficult to remove. After the paper is 
off, wash down the walls with pure 
water or strong soda water or vine- 
gar and water applied with a large 
sponge or brush. Let them dry thor- 
oughly before treating. 

To Repair Plaster. — To repair 
cracks formed in plaster by the set- 
tling of new houses, the sagging of 
old houses, the decay of ceilings and 
floor timbers, and accidental breaks 
in the plaster, first cut away the 
edges of the cracks or breaks with 
a sharp knife. Make the edge 
straight or slightly slanting in. Then 
fill with plaster of Paris mixed with 
water, to which may be added vine- 
gar, flour paste, or sand. 

Or fill with paper pulp moistened 
with glue. 

To mend small breaks, mix plaster 
of Paris with cold water and apply 
quickly with a case knife, smoothing 
the plaster as you apply it. Mix a 
small quantity at a time and work 
quickly, as the plaster hardens very 
fast. 

Or to prevent plaster of Paris 
from hardening quickly, when repair- 
ing larger breaks that take more 
material and more time, mix 1 table- 
spoonful of plaster of Paris with 2 
or 3 tablespoonfuls of fine sand and 
dilute with vinegar. The more vine- 
gar used, the slower the plaster will 
set. 

Or mix plaster of Paris with an 
equal quantity of cold flour paste. 

Or to mend large cracks and 
breaks, soak bits of wall paper to a 
pulp with water, squeeze out the wa- 
ter, and mix to a stiff paste or jell 
with thin size or glue made by dis- 
solving 1 ounce of good glue in 1 
pint of hot water over a slow fire. 



Pour the whole on cheese cloth to re- 
move the excess of water. Press the 
paper pulp into the cracks and holes 
in the plaster with a putty knife. 
But do not quite fill the crack to tlie 
surface of the plaster, as the pulp 
does not admit of a smooth surface. 
When nearly dry, smooth the surface 
with plaster of Paris and let dry be- 
fore tinting or repapering. The pa- 
per pulp when hard is as strong as 
wood, and cracks filled in this man- 
ner will never reopen. 

Size for Paper Hanging. — To pre- 
pare walls for paper hanging, first 
remove old paper, mend cracks and 
breaks, and wash down the walls 
with a cloth or sponge wet in warm 
water. Then apply with a white- 
wash brush a solution of 4 ounces of 
common glue dissolved in 1 gallon of 
boiling water over a slow fire. Or 
apply a good shellac size. 

Paper Hanger's Paste. — Mix 4 
pounds of flour, ^ pound of powdered 
alum, and i pound of pulverized 
rosin. Rub up this mixture with a 
small quantity of warm water until 
smooth and free from lumps. Mix 
with boiling water to the consistency 
of cream and boil until it thickens. 

Or use cornstarch or wheat starch 
or rice flour instead of wheat flour. 

To use this paste, spread it freely 
on the paper, then lay or fold the 
pasted sides lightly together. This 
assists in distributing the paste 
evenly and also in handling the pa- 
per. After the upper end has been 
attached, the lower part may be un- 
folded as it goes on the wall. The 
wall should first be coated with a 
thin glue size made of about 4 ounces 
of glue to 1 gallon of water. 

Or make a glue size by dissolving 
10 ounces of glue in 2* gallons of 
water. INIix 9 pounds of bole, an 
earthy substance resembling clay, 
with water to the consistency of 
cream, and strain oft' the water 
through cheese cloth. Add the mois- 
tened bole to the glue size and stir 
in 2 pounds of gypsum. Strain 
through cheese cloth and dilute with 
boiling water. This is an excellent 
paste for old walls covered with one 
or more coatings of whitewash. 

To Hang Wall Paper. — First trim 



790 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



close to the pattern the plain strip on 
one edge of the paper, but not the 
other. Next measure the height of 
the room by holding an end of the 
paper up to the ceiling and mari<ing 
along the baseboard with any blunt 
instrument. Cut along this mark 
and use the first strip as a pattern. 
Cut a sufficient number of additional 
strips for the plain walls, making al- 
lowances for doors and windows. 
Lay the strips face down on a large 
table, or make a suitable bench by 
laying old boards across a couple of 
chair backs or barrels. Apply the 
paste with a whitewash brush. If 
the paper is heavy, let it lie after 
pasting until it is slightly soaked 
with the paste, or until the surface 
is sticky rather than wet. Com- 
mence at a door or window and place 
the close-cut edge against the frame. 
First press the upper end against the 
ceiling and press downward with a 
clean cloth. Place the next strip so 
that the close-cut edge will overlie 
the half-inch strip left upon the first 
strip, and so proceed until the room 
is finished. 

But remember that all heavy- 
weight papers in solid colors, as in- 
grain, duplex, or cartridge papers, 
and most cloth or fabric wall cover- 
ings, must be " butted " rather than 
overlapped. That is, the edges must 
be placed close enough together to 
cover the wall, but without overlap- 
ping each other. 

To fit around doors, window cas- 
ings, and other jogs, cut and paste a 
full strip, apply it to the wall at the 
ceiling, and press with a cloth down 
to the top of the door or window 
frame and along the side of the ad- 
jacent wall. Press carefully up to 
the frame and cut along the edge 
with a sharp knife to take out the 
section of paper which comes over 
the door or window. It will assist 
to clip diagonally with shears toward 
the corner of the opening, taking care 
not to clip too far, although the di- 
agonal clipping, if it extends into 
the paper on the wall, may be con- 
cealed by carefully bringing the 
edges together. 

To Paper a Rough Wall. — To 
paper old walls of boards, planks. 



or wainscoting without plaster, or 
sanded walls that have not been 
" skimmed " with plaster or lime, or 
other rough surfaces, it may be nec- 
essary to first hang a layer of cot- 
ton cloth to furnish a smooth sur- 
face on which to hang paper. The 
difficulty of hanging paper on a 
rough surface is that the paper, be- 
ing stiff, does not yield to the depres- 
sions in the wall. Hence air spaces 
are left that cause the paper to blis- 
ter and peel off. The advantages of 
using cloth are that it is flexible, that 
it takes up more paste than paper 
does, and hence that it adheres more 
closely to the wall. It affords a 
smooth and suitable surface on which 
to hang paper, and gives the final re- 
sult a good appearance. First go 
over rough surfaces with sandpaper. 
Tack this to a large block of wood, 
into which, to avoid using a steplad- 
der, insert an old broom handle. 

Next apply liberally to the walls 
hot boiled flour or other suitable 
paste containing a tablespoonful of 
borax to each gallon of water. Cover 
with paste one strip at a time, and 
immediately hang on the wet wall 
any suitable cotton stuff. Unbleach- 
ed cotton sheeting or cheese cloth an- 
swers this purpose; or old sheets, 
pillowcases, and the like may be 
utilized. After hanging the cloth, 
brush it down with a whitewash 
brush dipped in the hot paste, and 
allow it to dry. Then hang the wall 
paper in the usual manner. 

To Paint Rough Walls. — To ob- 
tain a suitable surface for painting 
or tinting in colors on rough boards, 
sanded walls, stucco, or other rough 
surfaces, first apply a layer of cot- 
ton cloth as above and hang a cheap, 
light-colored wall paper. When dry, 
pare off with a potato knife the 
seams in the paper caused by over- 
lapping the edges, running the sharp 
edge down the seam from top to bot- 
tom, or use carefully an old razor for 
this purpose. Apply two or three 
coats of paint and white varnish al- 
ternately, allowing one to dry before 
putting " on the next. The " varnish 
will prevent the paint from becom- 
ing soiled, and the surface will last 
a lifetime.

To Paint a Whitewashed Wall. — 
Scrape oflf the loose lime with any 
blunt-edged tool. A hoe is conven- 
ient. Go over the wall with sand- 
paper tacked to a large block of 
wood and fastened to a handle. 
Wash with a sponge to remove the 
lime and let dry. Fill cracks and 
breaks with plaster of Paris. They 
will be concealed by the paint. Do 
not use putty for this purpose, as 
that when dry would have a differ- 
ent-looking surface. Apply one or 
two coats of shellac or glue size, 3 
or 4 ounces of either to a gallon of 
boiling water. Cover with any suit- 
able paint and varnish. 

CARE OF WALLS 

To Clean Wall Paper. — Brush 
down the walls with a hairbrush or 
dust cloth, then cut a loaf of yeast 
bread two or three days old once ver- 
tically through the middle, and again 
crosswise. Hold these pieces by the 
crust and rub the wall downward 
with long, light strokes. Do not rub 
across the paper, or rub harder than 
is necessary. An ordinary coarse 
grater held in the left hand will be 
found convenient to rub off the sur- 
face of the bread as it becomes soil- 
ed. Clean thoroughly as you go. 

Or in 1 quart of water, dissolve 
3 ounces of salt, 1 ounce of am- 
monia, 1 ounce of oil of sassafras. 
Mix well and add flour enough to 
make a stiff batter. Put in a can or 
bucket, close up tight, and hang in a 
boiler of water. Boil until thor- 
oughly done. 

The dough should be stiff enough 
not to stick to the hands or to the 
paper. Take a piece as large as the 
fist, dip it in dry corn meal, and use 
until it becomes soiled. Change as 
often as necessary. 

Or make a similar stiff dough of 
wheat flour and water. Afterwards 
brush down the walls with a clean 
soft brush or dust cloth to remove 
the crumbs. 

To Remove Grease from Wall 
Paper. — To remove grease and oil 
stains from wall paper, fold a piece 
of blotting paper, and in the fold 
spread pipe clay or French chalk. 



Stitch or pin the edges together to 
keep the chalk from falling out. Lay 
this over the grease spot and apply a 
hot iron, taking care not to scorch 
the paper. Change the blotting pa- 
per occasionally, and, if necessary, 
repeat with a fresh iron. 

Or make a thick paste of powdered 
pipe clay or French chalk and apply 
it to the spot with a brush. Let it 
remain until dry. Then brush off 
and repeat if necessary. 

To Dust Walls. — To remove dust 
from walls, use a clean hairbrush or 
window brush with a suitable handle. 
Brush from the top downward. 

Or make a bag to cover the head 
of the broom. 

Or draw a sleeve or leg of a suit 
of old knit underwear over the head 
of the broom. Put the broom han- 
dle through the large part and draw 
it well down over the broom. The 
downward motion of the broom on 
the wall will hold the cloth tightly in 
place. 

Or crumple an old paper bag in 
the hands, but without tearing it, 
and slip it over the head of the 
broom. This can be removed and 
burned after using. 

Or insert into a clean mop handle 
a suitable dust cloth, as several thick- 
nesses of cheese cloth or discarded 
cotton or woolen underwear, and 
sweep down the wall with this. 

To Mend Wall Paper. — To patch a 
spot knocked out of the wall paper, 
or holes in exposed cracks or edges, 
take a piece of paper to match the 
pattern and expose to the sun until 
it fades to the same shade. Cut a 
patch an inch or two larger than the 
broken place, lay it face down on a 
piece of glass, moisten it with a suit- 
able paste, and when moist scrape or 
pare the edge with a sharp knife or 
old razor to a very fine slant or bevel. 

Lay on a fresh coat of paste, es- 
pecially around the edge, and apply 
the patch so as to match the design. 
Rub the edges down with gentle 
strokes of a soft cloth, and if done 
skillfully the patch will not be no- 
ticeable. 

Or, if spots are too small to patch, 
obtain, for a few cents, a child's box 
of water colors, mix the colors to ob- 



792 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



tain the right shade, and paint the 
spots with a small camel's-hair brush. 
A 25-cent box of colors will last a 
long time, and a little practice will 
enable any one to match the colors 
and keep the wall paper in good or- 
der. Faded spots left on solid-col- 
ored wall papers by the removal of 
pictures may be renovated by paint- 
ing them with dyestuff. Select a 
color as near that of the paper as 
possible, follow the directions that 
come with the dye, and apply to the 
wall with a brush. Care must be 
taken not to let the dye drip on floor 
coverings or furniture. When first 
applied, the painted spot will be 
darker than the rest, but it will 
quickly dry to its proper tint or 
shade. 

To Clean Calcimined Walls. — Rub 
on corn meal with a coarse cloth, or 
moisten a soft cloth or sponge in aqua 
ammonia and rub spots very lightly. 

To Renovate Blackened Walls. — 
A smoked or blackened ceiling or 
wall may be cleaned by means of a 
cloth wrung out of a strong solution 
of baking soda and water. Or use 
vinegar and water. If the stain is 
not all removed, dissolve gum shellac 
in alcohol to the consistency of milk 
or cream and with it cover the sooty 
parts. Paint or whitewash over the 
shellac. The black will not show 
through. 

To Dry Walls that Are Damp. — 
If there is much dampness in a room 
that is not commonly heated, it may 
cause the walls to mold or mildew, be- 
sides being unhealthy. To absorb the 
dampness, place unslacked lime in flat, 
open vessels, as dripping pans, plates, 
or saucers. Lime has an affinity for 
dampness and also purifies the air. 
Renew the lime as fast as it becomes 
air-slacked and crumbles into a fine, 
dry powder. 

Walls are often damp for no ap- 
parent cause. Brick and other porous 
walls may hold moisture, or it may 
work up from springs through the 
foundations of brick or stone houses. 
The causes should be sought and, if 
possible, removed. 

To prepare damp walls for cal- 
cimine or paper, make a size of 1 
ounce of glue to 1 gallon of water, 



and add i ounces of alum and t ounces 
of boiled linseed oil. Apply one or 
two coats and let dry before paper- 
ing. 

Or apply with a whitewash brush, 
during summer when the wall is dryer, 
a solution of 1 pound of castile or 
other hard white soap in 1 gallon of 
water. Let stand a day or two to 
dry. Follow with a second coat of 
i pound of alum in a pailful of water, 
and let dry before papering. 

Or, if the walls are very damp, ap- 
ply thin sheet lead or tin foil to the 
walls with a suitable cement. Or 
fasten with flat-headed copper tacks. 
These may be driven into the damp 
spots only or, if necessary, into the 
entire wall. Afterwards paper. 

To Remove Mold from Walls. — 
To remove mold or mildew from walls 
or ceilings, apply with a whitewash 
brush a solution of 1 pound of chloride 
of lime dissolved in a pailful of water. 

To prevent dampness when build- 
ing, after the walls are a few feet 
above the ground lay a row of stone 
or brick with a mixture of tar pitch 
and fine sand in place of mortar. 

WINDOWS, DOORS, ETC. 

To Clean Windows. — Do not use 
soapsuds on windows. The soap ad- 
heres and requires a good deal of 
rinsing to remove. The easiest way 
to clean windows is witn a chamois 
or clean cloth and clear water. Wring 
out the chamois or cloth so as to be 
wet but not dripping, and wash the 
windows clean. Afterwards wring 
dry and go over them again. Finally 
polish with a dry cloth ol" chamois. 
Rinse the cloth and change the water 
as often as necessary. 

Or, if the windows are much soiled, 
use a little washing soda, but do not 
let water containing soda drip or stain 
the paint on the sash. Wash one pane 
at a time and wipe with a dry cloth. 

Or add 1 tablespoonful of kerosene, 
gasoline, or ammonia to each quart of 
water, lliis cleans quickly and gives 
a high polish. 

Or, if the windows are not much 
soiled, wet them with a soft cloth 
dampened with kerosene or ammonia 
water, and wipe with a dry cloth. 



HOUSE CLEANING 



793 



Or mix a little dry starch with cold 
water to the consistency of cream, 
and wash the windows with this, leav- 
ing it to dry on. When dry, rub it 
off with a damp newspaper. This 
gives a high polish without lint or 
streaks. 

To Remove Paint. — To remove 
paint spots from windows, soften them 
with hot, strong vinegar, or a strong 
solution of pearlash and rub a copper 
or silver coin over them to loosen the 
paint. 

To Hemove Putty. — To remove 
putty, go over it with a red-hot poker 
or other hot iron, taking care not to 
touch the paint on the window sashes. 
When the putty is hot, slip a dull 
knife blade between it and the wood- 
work and it will readily come off. 
Any other method that will remove 
putty is likely to injure the paint on 
the sashes. 

Or apply two or three coats of par- 
affin oil by means of a small brush, 
allowing each coat a half hour or more 
to penetrate before the next one is 
applied. 

Or apply soft soap freely by means 
of a brush. In a short time the hard- 
ened linseed oil is dissolved, making 
the putty plastic, so that it can be 
readily removed. 

Window Corners. — Use a whisk 
broom to dig out the corners of the 
window sash, or use wings of turkeys, 
geese, or chickens. These are also 
good to wash windows, as they are 
free from dust and lint. 

Or use a piece of whalebone or a 
skewer to clean out the corners of the 
sash. 

To Polish Windows. — Polish win- 
dows with dry chamois or tissue paper 
or an old newspaper slightly mois- 
tened. 

Or apply with a moistened rag pow- 
dered indigo, pumice stone, or fuller's 
earth, and polish. 

Or fold a piece of cheese cloth and 
put a quantity of pulverized pumice 
stone between the folds, stitching 
around the edge to keep the powder 
from spilling. Polish chimneys and 
window panes with this prepared 
cloth. It gives a high polish instantly, 
and will last a long time. 

Or with a soft cloth rub a little 



vinegar on the glass. Rub dry and 
polish. 

To Prevent Windows from Steam- 
ing. — After cleaning the glass, rub 
over it a rag slightly moistened with 
glycerin. 

Windows — To Keep Out the Sun. 
— Make a paste of powdered gum 
tragacanth and white of egg. Beat 
with an egg beater and let it stand 
twenty-four hours. Apply with a soft 
brush and let dry. 

To Clean Mirrors. — Mix a little 
powdered bluing, whiting, or pumice 
stone with alcohol to form a thin 
paste. Smear the surface of the mir- 
ror with this by means of a small 
sponge or soft rag, and before the al- 
cohol evaporates rub it dry with a 
clean cloth. Afterwards polish with 
silk, chamois, or tissue paper. 

Or wring a cloth or chamois out of 
clear water, dip in dry whiting, and 
apply. Rub with a dry cloth or 
chamois and polish. 

Or apply whiting mixed with tea to 
form a thin paste. Use clear tea to 
remove stains. 

Or wring a newspaper as you would 
a cloth out of cold water, so that it 
will be damp but not wet. Rub the 
glass with this, and afterwards dry 
with a fresh newspaper softened by 
crumpling it in the hands. 

To Polish Mirrors. — Use a dry 
chamois or pumice bag, or a silk hand- 
kerchief, or tissue paper, or apply 
powdered chalk or whiting with any 
of these. Or use a dry cloth slightly 
moistened with a few drops of aqua 
ammonia. 

To Lubricate Window Sashes. — 
To lubricate a window sash that rubs 
or swells in damp weather so that it 
cannot be raised and lowered readily, 
slush freely with common yellow soap 
the edge of the sash and the grove in 
which it runs. This may be done by 
moistening the soap and rubbing it 
over the parts, or by dissolving the 
soap in its own bulk of water, and 
applying the soap jelly with a brush. 

Or use a wax candle instead of 
soap. 

To Prevent Window Sashes from 
Rattling. — A lialf of a clothespin 
will cure temporarily the rattling of a 
window sash. 



794 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



To Restore Window Glass. — To re- 
store the transparency of window 
glass that has become dingy by ex- 
posure to the elements, rub with di- 
lute muriatic acid, 1 part of acid to 
10 parts of water, and polish with a 
moist cloth dii)ped in whiting. 

To Prevent Doors from Creaking. 
— Dij) a feather in oil and apply to 
the hinges. 

Or rub on a piece of soap. 

Or mix equal parts of soap, lard, 
and black lead, and apply with the 
point of a lead pencil or in melted 
form by means of a small brush. 

Burglar-proof Lock. — Lock the 
door, leave the key in the lock, and 
keep it there by means of a heavy 
copper wire 11 inches long bent in 
the shape of a hairpin. Put this over 
the spindle back of the knob, with 
the ends down through the head of the 
key. The key cannot then be ]iushed 
out or turned by a burglar's tool or 
another key inserted from the out- 
side. This is a convenient device for 
a traveler to use in hotels, where du- 
])licate keys are often issued to ser- 
vants and others. 

Or one end of the wire may be fas- 
tened to the casement by means of a 
staple, and the other end formed into 
a hook to hold the key in position. 

Or an ordinary hook may be used 
for this purpose. 

Skeleton Key. — Obtain from a 
locksmith a skeleton key similar to the 
keys used by burglars and furnished 
to employees of hotels whose duties 
require them to have admission to all 
the rooms. This will be exceedingly 
convenient when other keys are lost 
or mislaid. 

To Fit Keys. — To fit an old key 
or a blank to rejjlace a key that has 
been lost, hold the key to be fitted in 
the flame of a candle until it is thor- 
oughly blackened, insert it carefully 
in the lock, and turn it until it .strikes 
the wards. Withdraw the key and file 
away the parts where the soot has 
been rubbed ofiF by the wards. 

CLEANING AND CARE OF FURNI- 
TURE 

To Clean Furniture. — Furniture, 
like other woodwork, tends to shrink 



if it becomes too dry, and should be 
washed for the sake of moisture as 
well as for the sake of cleanliness. 
Hence furniture, besides being cleaned, 
when necessary, with suitable cleans- 
ing compounds, should be sponged oc- 
casionally with clear water and wiped 
dry. 

But do not use soap or washing 
powders on jiainted or varnished fur- 
niture. Remove dirt, dust, and stains 
with other cleansing agents, and rinse 
by sponging with clear water. Wipe 
dry, oil, and polish. Detergents rec- 
ommended for cleaning furniture, re- 
moving finger marks, white spots, and 
stains are olive, sweet, linseed, paraf- 
fin, and other oils; whiting, fuller's 
earth, cold tea, kerosene, turpentine, 
soda, essence of peppermint, camphor, 
asphaltum, vinegar, various acids, and 
combinations of these. 

To Wash Furniture. — To wash fur- 
niture, use a large sponge, wipe dry, 
and polish dry as possible with a 
chamois skin wrung out of clear water, 
or with a soft flannel cloth. Do not 
use dry chamois on varnished wood 
or polished surfaces. AVipe always in 
one direction, preferably with the 
grain of the wood. 

Wash carved wood with a stiff hair 
paint brush dipped in clear water. 

Or wash with cold tea applied with 
a sponge or brush, wipe dry, oil, and 
polish. 

Care of Furniture. — To keep pol- 
ished or varnished furniture in good 
order, each article should be gone 
over lightly once a week on cleaning 
day with clear hot (not boiling) water 
without soap, or with cold tea, or any 
other suitable cleanser. 

Or, if there is not time for this, af- 
ter dusting the furniture, rub it over 
with a cloth moistened with kerosene, 
turpentine, cold tea, or cold-drawn 
linseed oil, or with a mixture of equal 
parts of these. This practice will as- 
sist in keeping it in good order. 

To Remove Finger Marks. — Mois- 
ten a flannel cloth in olive, linseed, 
sweet, or paraffin oil to remove the 
spots. Wipe dry, and polish with 
flannel or a chamois skin wrung out of 
clear water. For oiled furniture use 
kerosene. 

To Remove White Marks. — To re- 



HOUSE CLEANING 



795 



move white marks on furniture caused 
by heat or water, hold a hot iron near 
them, but not near enough to burn or 
scorch. 

Or rub with a cloth moistened with 
kerosene. 

Or with a cloth apply equal parts 
of linseed oil and alcohol. 

Or, if the stain is obstinate, cover 
with baking soda and hold a hot iron 
close to the spot, taking care not to 
scorch or burn the wood. Repeat if 
necessary. 

Or apply olive oil or sweet oil, and 
polish with a cloth moistened in al- 
cohol. 

Or apply essence of peppermint 
with a cloth. Wipe dry and polish. 

Or use a mixture composed of equal 
parts of vinegar, sweet oil, and tur- 
pentine. 

Or rub with a cloth wet in spirits 
of camphor or camphorated oil or 
turpentine. 

Or use a cloth saturated with any 
of these. 

After using any of the above, wipe 
the spot dry, apply furniture oil, and 
polish with damp chamois or silk or 
linen cloth. Do not allow alcohol, 
turpentine, camphor, or similar de- 
tergents to remain on a polished sur- 
face. 

To Remove Ink Stains. — To re- 
move ink stains, first test the ink by 
applying water to see if it contains 
coal-tar products, as eosin or nigro- 
sine. If these are present the ink 
when wet will run. In that case use 
an alkali, as baking soda mixed with 
water to form a paste, and let it dry 
on. Repeat if necessary. 

Or, if water does not cause the ink 
to run, it is probably an iron-gall or 
logwood ink; hence apply an acid, 
preferably oxalic acid, dissolved in 
an equal quantity of water. Saturate 
a cloth with the solution and lay it on 
the spot to soften the ink. Then wash 
with the solution until the ink disap- 
pears. 

Or apply salts of lemon. 

Or a mixture of 6 parts of spirits 
of salt (diluted hydrochloric acid) 
and 1 part of salts of lemon. 

Or use 1 part of nitric, muriatic, 
or sulphuric acid diluted with 10 parts 
of water. Apply by dipping a cork 



in the mixture and touching the stain, 
or by means of a feather. 

But remember that all of these acids 
are poisonous, and that all except ox- 
alic acid will burn or blister the skin. 
Also, if used in too great strength, 
they will remove paint and varnish 
and themselves stain the surfaces they 
are applied to. Hence use no more 
acid than is necessary and immedi- 
ately sponge off with clear water con- 
taining a little ammonia, wipe dry, 
oil, and polish. 

To Remove Bruises from Furni- 
ture. — To renovate furniture that 
has been bruised or scratched without 
injuring the fiber of the wood, apply 
moisture and heat. Wet a cloth in 
warm water, not hot, and lay it over 
the parts. Hold near a hot iron, but 
not near enough to scorch or char the 
wood. Repeat until the bruise comes 
up. If the varnish is discolored, ap- 
ply any of the above remedies. 

Or use, instead of cloth, several 
thicknesses of brown paper moistened 
in water. 

Or, if the bruise is small, omit the 
cloth or paper. Wet the spot and 
hold near it a hot iron. Then lay over 
the scratched or bruised surface a 
cloth dipped in linseed oil. Finally 
rub with a mixture of equal parts of 
turpentine and linseed oil, and pol- 
ish. 

Oils for Wood Furniture. — Furni- 
ture polish containing oil or wax will 
not be needed if tlie wood is washed 
occasionally with clear warm water, 
not hot, without soap, and rubbed 
dry with chamois or a soft cloth. 
But if furniture polish containing 
fixed oils is used the furniture must 
be rubbed vigorously and kept in 
condition by daily rubbing to pre- 
vent oil accumulating so as to be felt 
or seen. Furniture oil should be 
sparingly used and the wood rubbed 
to a high polish or until it does not 
have any greasy feel. 

Soap for Furniture. — Soap should 
not be used on wood finished with 
shellac or varnish or treated with 
furniture wax or oil. Soap has the 
property of destroying oily and resi- 
nous substances, and thus tends to 
eat away the coating, destroy the 
polish, and expose the wood.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



To Remove Furniture Scratches. — 
Go over the articles with a soft raj? 
dampened in kerosene oil. This will 
cause all light scratches or surface 
bruises to disappear. 

Or, if the scratches or cracks are 
deep, melt a little beeswax, and thin 
out with turpentine to the consist- 
ency of sirup. Apply with a soft 
cloth, and polish with flannel or vel- 
veteen. 

To Restore the Color of Furniture. 
— Apply raw linseed oil by means of 
a flannel cloth to restore the color, 
.and let stand over night. 

Or, for highly polished surfaces, as 
rosewood or mahogany, apply a cloth 
moistened with alcohol. Afterwards 
polish with a soft cloth moistened 
with turpentine. 

linseed Oil for Furniture. — Ap- 
ply raw linseed oil as a restorer, with 
or without an equal quantity of tur- 
pentine. 

Care of Piano. — The back of the 
piano should be protected by a dust 
cloth of denim or other suitable ma- 
terial tacked or pasted lightly to the 
frame. In moist climate the wires 
will be protected from dust by 
sprinkling them with unslaked lime. 
The keys should be wiped with al- 
cohol once a week on cleaning day 
to prevent them from yellowing, and 
the varnish may be kept in good con- 
dition by wiping once a week with 
a chamois wrung out of cold or warm 
water, or by wiping with a cloth 
moistened with turpentine, kerosene, 
or cold-drawn linseed oil, or a mix- 
ture of these. 

To Clean Pianos. — A careful in- 
quiry by a dealer in pianos from the 
largest factories in the United States 
discloses the fact that there is no 
better means of cleaning a polished 
piano or any other highly polished 
furniture than to simply wash it in 
lukewarm water, drying each part ])er- 
fectly by rubbing briskly as fast as 
it is washed. This method is as safe 
as it is simple. It leaves the polish 
absolutely uninjured. 

To Clean Piano Keys. — Remove 
stains with oxalic acid and keep the 
keys white by rubbing with a soft 
piece of cloth wet with ;dcohol or 
with cologne water. Expose the kej's 



to sunshine on bright, sunny days to 
bleach them. 

Cleaner for Musical Instruments. 
— To clean guitars, violins, etc., mix 
equal quantities of linseed oil, tur- 
])entine, and water. Shake well be- 
fore using to form an emulsion or 
cream. Hub the instrument with a 
cloth dampened in this cream, wipe 
dry, and polish with woolen cloth, 
chamois, or velveteen. 

To Clean Cane Chairs and Wicker, 
Bamboo, and Rattan Furniture. — 
First blow the dust out of the crev- 
ices with a pair of bellows or a good- 
sizod automobile foot pump. This 
will greatly assist in cleaning. Make 
a suds by dissolving half a bar of 
white soap in a gallon or more of 
water and add half a cupful of com- 
mon salt. This will prevent the cane 
from turning yellow. Apply the suds 
to the chair with a scrubbing brush, 
first one side and then the other, 
using plenty of water so that the cane 
may be thoroughly soaked. Place it 
out of doors to dry in a shady place. 
This will make the cane firm and 
tight and renew its elasticity. 

To Bleach Willow Furniture. — To 
bleach willow furniture, make a suds 
as above and add 2 ounces of bleach- 
ing powder. 

To Renovate Cane Chairs. — When 
the cane bottoms of chairs wear out, 
buy new cane and learn to weave 
cane seats. This is a simple art 
which may be easily learned by any- 
one, experimenting with the cane of 
an old chair and by a little practice. 

CIEANING PICTURE FRAMES 

To Protect Gilt Picture Frames.— 
Brush gilt frames with water in 
which onions have been boiled — three 
or four to a pint. Also wash the 
glass with it. Onion water will not 
injure the frames, and will prevent 
flies from lighting upon the pic- 
ture. 

Or, after dusting, go over the 
frames lightly with a soft flannel 
cloth moistened in kerosene. 

Or give them a coat of clear parch- 
ment size. This will prevent the dirt 
from darkening the gilt. The size 
may be sponged with cold water or

oil of turpentine, and left to dry 
without wiping. 

Or give the frames when new a 
coat of white varnish. This may be 
washed with clear cold water. 

Or wash soiled gilt frames with a 
gill of vinegar dissolved in a pint of 
cold water and applied with a soft 
brush. 

Or stir into a quart of water 
enough powdered sulphur to give it 
a slightly yellow tinge, and in this 
water boil four or five sliced onions. 
Strain and apply with a soft brush 
to soiled gilt frames. 

Or to 3 ounces of white of egg add 
1 ounce of chloride of potassium or 
soda and beat up together. Dust the 
frame with a soft brush, and brush 
over them with the above mixture. 

Or apply well-beaten white of egg 
with a camel's-hair brush and wipe 
off with a soft flannel cloth. But 
rub with the cloth very little and 
very lightly. 

Or wash with alcohol or spirits of 
turpentine, using a soft sponge, and 
let dry without wiping. 

All picture frames should be 
treated with one of the above prepa- 
rations several times during the 
spring and summer. 

Or cover the frames with oiled 
tarlatan, which may be obtained 
ready oiled for this purpose. 

Or brush boiled linseed oil over 
ordinary tarlatan. This is excellent 
for keeping dust from books, bric-a- 
brac, and various other objects. 

Apply alcohol to fly spots and 
other stains with a camel's-hair brush 
to soften them, and wipe off the frame 
with a soft chamois or flannel cloth. 
Do not use linen for this purpose, as 
it deadens the brightness of the gild- 
ing. 

To Renovate Gilt Frames. — Apply 
gilt paint with a camel's-hair brush 
to spots where the gilding has come 
off so as to expose the wood. 

Or if the bit of gilding that has 
come off can he found and is large 
enough, moisten the spot with glue 
and replace it, bringing it u]) to a 
level by means of putty if necess.iry. 
Let dry and go over it with gold 
paint. 
To Clean Gilt Ornaments. — Make 



a strong solution of cyanide of po- 
tassium. But remember that this is 
a deadly poison. Apply with a stiff 
brush, or dip the articles in this solu- 
tion. Afterwards rinse with water, 
using a soft brush, and dry in box- 
wood or other hard-wood shavings. 
These may be obtained of any jew- 
eler. Store away gilt articles in box- 
wood shavings to keep them from 
tarnishing. 

Or clean them with a lather of 
soft white soap, rising with clear 
water. 

To Clean Silver Ornaments. — 
Make a suds by dissolving hard wiiite 
soap in boiling water, immerse the 
articles, and boil for five minutes. 
Remove and scrub gently with a soft 
brush, rinse in clear boiling water, 
and wipe dry with a soft cloth. Lay 
them near the fire until the moisture 
has perfectly evaporated, or cover 
them with boxwood sawdust until 
fully dried. 

To Preserve Oil Paintings. — Ap- 
ply two or three coats of pure white- 
lead paint to the back of the can- 
vas. This preserves the canvas from 
damp, mold, and mildew, and makes 
it practically indestructible. Many 
ancient canvases treated in this way 
have been preserved for centuries. 
The same process will strengthen a 
decaying canvas. 

To Clean Oil Paintings. — To clean 
an oil painting, wash tlie surface 
gently with clear warm water, using 
a soft cloth or fine sponge, let dry, 
and rub gently with a soft flannel 
cloth moistened with pure olive oil. 
The water softens the accumulated 
smoke, dust, and dirt, and the oil 
assists in wiping it away. 

Or wash with milk diluted with 
warm water, and dry without rins- 
ing. 

Or cut a potato in half and rub 
gently with the fresh surface, slicing 
off the soiled portions, until the whole 
is cleansed. 

The practice of covering the sur- 
face of paintings with soft soap or 
other alkaline lyes is a very mischiev- 
ous one. If the paintings are of any 
value, they should be cleaned only by 
an export. 

To Clean Prints. — Fasten the print

to a board by means of tbumb tacks, 
cover with fine common salt, and 
moisten the salt slightly with lemon 
juice. Turn the board at an angle 
and pour boiling water over the sur- 
face until the salt and lemon juice 
are washed off. Dry gradually in the 
shade. 

Or, to remove yellow stains from 
engravings, dissolve hydrochloride of 
soda in water. Moisten a cloth with 
this solution and lay over the stain 
until it is removed. Rinse with clear 
water. 

To Restore White in Oil Paint- 
ings. — To renovate old oil paintings 
in which the whites have become 
dark by the action of the air on 
paints containing carbonate of lead 
or other lead compounds, apply, by 
means of a soft brush, water charged 
with four of five volumes of oxygen. 
Afterwards let dry and go over the 
painting with copal varnish. 

To Mend Gilt Frames. — To replace 
on gilt frames ornaments that have 
been broken off and lost, melt to- 
gether with gentle heat 1 pound of 
rosin, i pint of linseed oil, and i 
gill of Venetian turpentine. Dissolve 
separately i pound of glue in 3 
quarts of water and mix the two 
solutions. Boil and stir constantly 
until the water is evaporated, leaving 
a thick mass, to which add powdered 
whiting until the whole is of the con- 
sistency of putty. Mold to the de- 
sired shape while warm, and when 
cold it will set and harden. Color 
with gilt paint. 

To Clean Wood Frames. — First 
dust with a soft brush, and after- 
wards wipe with flannel dipped in 
sweet oil. 

Or wash with clear, cold water with- 
out soap, washing powder or other 
detergent, as alkalies tend to injure 
the finish. 

To Renovate Old Gilt Frames. — 
Gilt frames that are past retouching 
with gilt paint may be renovated by 
removing the gilding with fine sand- 
]>aper or rubbing down the surface 
with a moistened cloth dipped in 
powdered pumice or rotten stone. 
Paint with black or other color of 
enamel paint or any desired stain, 
and afterwards apply a coat of copal 
or any hard white varnish. 



CLEANING BRIC-A-BRAC 
MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS 



AND 



To Clean Brass Furniture. — Brass 
bedsteads and brass fittings on fur- 
niture may be cleaned by moistening 
a cloth in sweet oil and dipping it 
in powdered whiting or rotten stone 
pulverized finely and sifted through 
cheese cloth. 

Or mix finely powdered tripoli with 
linseed oil. Apply with a sponge or 
rag, and polish with a piece of felt or 
velveteen. 

Or moisten a cloth in ammonia and 
dip in powdered whiting. 

To Clean Brass Inlaid Work. — 
Mix equal quantities of rotten stone, 
starch, and oxalic acid with water 
to a stiff paste and dilute with sweet 
oil. Apply with a piece of felt or 
velveteen, and polish with a flannel 
rag or moistened chamois. 

To Clean Bric-a-Brac. — Brass or- 
naments on bric-a-brac may be 
cleaned with a piece of stale bread. 
Hold the bread by the crust and rub 
carefully, allowing the crumbs to 
fall with the dirt. Brass candle- 
Sticks, lamps, and the like may be 
cleaned with soap and water, but 
lacquered articles require careful 
treatment without soap. 

To Clean Bronzes. — Genuine 
bronzes may be washed with good 
soapsuds and a sponge or rag, and 
wiped dry with a soft flannel cloth 
or chamois. 

Or dirt and stains may first be 
removed with a flannel cloth mois- 
tened in sweet oil; afterwards pol- 
ish with flannel or chamois. 

To Clean Mother-of -Pearl.— Rub 
with a cheese-cloth bag containing 
dry pumice, or apply finely pow- 
dered pumice moistened with sweet 
oil, and polish with a piece of felt 
or velveteen. 

To Clean "Upholstered Furniture. 
— Take the furniture out of doors 
and freely apply gasoline or naph- 
tha. Pour these on so as to saturate 
the upholstered parts, and rub vigor- 
ously with a soft hair brush, sponge, 
or flannel cloth dipped in warm gas- 
oline until all spots and soiled places 
are fully cleaned. Keep the furni- 
ture out of doors in a draught until 



HOUSE CLEANING 



799 



the cleanser evaporates. This process 
will also destroy tnoths. 

To Clean Brick or Stone Work. — 
Mop with a solution of caustic potash 
or soda with oxalic acid dissolved in 
water. Or pour the mixture over the 
surfaces and scrub with a scrubbing 
brush, but do not dip the hands in 
this mixture and do not use it too 
strong. 

To Clean Ivory. — For cleaning 
ivory, use prepared chalk, lime, brick 
dust, turpentine, lemon juice, salt and 
vinegar, lime, potash, and alum. 

Ivory ornaments, brooches, card 
cases, bracelets, carvings, piano keys, 
and the like may be cleaned by 
painting them over with spirits of 
turpentine and, when possible, ex- 
posing them fop two or three days 
to sunshine. Or articles that can be 
taken out of doors may be bleached 
by simply moistening them with water 
and exposing them to direct sun- 
shine. 

Or dissolve slaked lime in water 
to the consistency of milk. Cover the 
articles with this, or dip them in it 
if convenient, and steep as long as 
may be necessary. Remove them, al- 
low the slaked lime to dry on, and 
when dry rub off and polish with a 
dry cloth. 

Or apply salt and lemon juice. 
Polish with whiting. Apply with a 
moist cloth and rub with a chamois. 

If small ivory articles are badly 
stained and discolored, first soak 
them for 24/ hours or longer in a 
solution of 1 part of baking soda 
to 4 parts of water. Rinse, and 
immerse in a solution of 1 pai't of 
sulphite of soda to 3 parts of water 
for another day or two. Then add 
to the latter solution 1 ounce of hydro- 
chloric acid diluted with 6 ounces of 
water, and allow the articles to stand 
in this for 2 or 3 days. Wash in clean 
water, dry, and polish. 

To Clean Bric-a-Brac. — For deep, 
narrow-necked flower vases, rose 
bowls, or carafes, cut some potato 
parings in small squares and pour 
over them water in which baking soda 
has been dissolved. Put them into 
the glasses to be cleaned, let stand a 
few minutes, and shake well. After- 
wards wash in soapsuds and polish. 



Or use 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar 
to 1 of rice. Shake well. 

To polish, use fuller's earth finely 
powdered or whiting. Never use hot 
water for these articles. Allow the 
water to cool until it will bear the 
hands comfortably. 

To Clean a Chandelier. — Apply 
pure vinegar with a small sponge; 
afterwards wash in soapsuds and 
polish with flannel or chamois. 

To renovate tarnished metallic 
parts, paint black with the dull-black 
paint used for ebonizlng. Or aj)ply 
white, gilt, or any other enamel paint 
desired. 

Glass Stoppers. — The glass stop- 
pers of decanters or carafes and other 
bottles sometimes stick and are very 
difficult to remove. To obviate this, 
use a large glass marble, either of 
clear glass or containing fancy fig- 
ures. This makes a good stopper for 
a decanter or water bottle and is 
easily removed. 

To remove a stopper that sticks, 
first apply a few drops of sweet oil 
or salad oil to the neck of the stop- 
per, and let stand a few minutes to 
soak in between the stopper and the 
neck of the bottle. 

If this does not loosen the stopper, 
apply heat to the neck of the bottle 
on the outside. It is well known that 
heat expands all sul)stances, and, if 
applied to the outside, the neck of 
the bottle will expand before the stop- 
per does, and the stopper will become 
loosened. This may be done by put- 
ting a narrow strip of flannel about 
the neck of the bottle and drawing 
it back and forth rapidly to create 
friction. This will sometimes cause 
heat enough in a few minutes. 

Or hold the hand about the neck 
of the bottle until the heat of the 
hand causes it to expand. 

Or, if this is not sufficient, dip a 
rag in water as hot as the hands will 
bear and wrap it about the neck of 
the bottle. Tills must not be done, 
however, when the bottle is very cold, 
as it may be cracked by expanding 
too suddenly. 

Or hold the neck of the bottle 
near a gas jet or an open flame, 
turning it constantly to prevent any 
part from becoming overheated.

HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



Or wrap a piece of cloth about the 
stopper and with a light piece of 
wood tap it gently, first on one side, 
then on the other. Do not use a 
hammer or other metal tool or utensil 
for this purpose. 

To Clean Clocks. — To clean a 
clock, saturate a cloth or pad of 
cotton with kerosene oil and lay it 
inside on a small dish that will pre- 
vent the woodwork from being satu- 
rated. As it evaporates, the fumes 
will loosen any foreign substance on 
the wheels of the clock and cause it 
to drop. Repeat as often as neces- 
sary. The fumes also tend to lubri- 
cate the works. 

Or remove the works of alarm 
clocks and others which are made 
exclusively of metal, and place them 
in an earthenware jar or other clean 
vessel having a tight-fitting cover. 
Pour over them kerosene oil through 
a cloth strainer or filter paper to 
remove all sediment. Let stand un- 
til the grease and dirt have been en- 
tirely cut and removed. The clock 
may be returned to its case without 
waiting for the excess of oil to evap- 
orate. 

To Oil Clocks. — To oil a clock, ob- 
tain the purest olive oil and cleanse 
it by adding half a pint of lime water 
to each quart of oil. Shake well and 
let stand three or four days, when the 
pure oil may be carefully poured off 
the sediment and strained through 
silk or filter paper. 

To Clean Metals. — Various acids 
are recommended for cleaning metals, 
as tartaric, oxalic, acetic, muriatic, 
and the like; also alcohol, turpentine, 
and petroleum products, and such 
materials as whiting, powdered pum- 
ice, rotten stone, bath brick, etc., 
mixed with water or oil. 

Paste for Metals. — Mix 1 ounce of 
oxalic acid with G ounces of rotten 
stone, and dilute to a soft paste with 
equal parts of train oil and spirits of 
turpentine. 

Or mix strong potash or soda lye 
with alcohol and apjily to metals with 
a brush. Let dry, and polish with a 
soft cloth or moist chamois. This will 
remove verdigris and most other forms 
of rust or tarnish. 

Brass — To Prevent Tarnishing. — 



Moisten powdered sal ammoniac with 
water and apply to the brass by means 
of a brush. Afterwards heat the ar- 
ticle until the sal ammoniac is melted. 
Cool, and polish with dry whiting 
and soft cloth. 

To Clean Brass. — Dissolve y, ounce 
of oxalic acid in 1 pint of soft water 
and wash the brass, or moisten a cloth 
in sweet oil dipped in powdered whit- 
ing or rotten stone, and scour. 

Or mix to a soft ])aste 1 ounce of 
starch, 1:3 ounces of rotten stone, 2 
ounces of sweet oil, and 2 ounces of 
oxalic acid with water, and apply with 
a cloth or chamois. 

Or, to clean brass inlaid work, mix 
tripoli with linseed oil, and apply by 
means of a piece of folded velveteen 
or other suitable polisher. Or use a 
good furniture paste. But if the wood 
has a very high polish, finish the clean- 
ing by rubbing on dry starch with the 
palm of the hand. 

Or mix 2 ounces of sulphuric acid, 
IJ ounces of nitric acid, 1 dram of 
saltpeter, and 2 ounces of rain water, 
and let stand until the solution set- 
tles. Dip the articles in this, or go 
over them with a soft brush dipped 
in this mixture, rinse immediately 
with soft water, and wipe dry. Or 
dry in sawdust. To prevent future 
tarnishing, apply a good coat of brass 
lacquer. 

To Clean Bronze. — To clean genu- 
ine bronze, apply hot soapsuds or boil 
the article in suds. Rinse and wipe 
dry with a soft cloth or chamos skin. 

Or, for small articles, apply sweet 
oil with a brush and rub off with a 
flannel cloth. 

Polish with dry whiting and cham- 
ois skin. 

To Clean Nickel. — Mix equal quan- 
tities of alcohol and aqua ammonia 
and stir in whiting to the consistency 
of thin ci'cara. Ajiply with a brush 
and soft cloth, let dry, and polish 
with a clean, dry cloth or chamois 
skin. 

Or, to remove stains from nickel, 
dilute 1 part of suljihuric acid in 50 
parts of alcohol, and dip the articles 
in the solution until the stains are re- 
moved, which should take not more 
than 5 or 10 seconds. Rinse in al- 
cohol and afterwards in clear water, 



HOUSE CLEANING 



801 



and polish with dry whiting and 
chamois. Repeat if necessary. 

To Clean Gilt Metals. — Metals fin- 
ished in gilt or lacquer should not be 
washed with strong soaps containing 
free alkali, but preferably with clear, 
soft warm water and a fine sponge. 

Or a little castile soap or other fine 
white soap may be used if necessary. 

Clean out the crevices in the orna- 
mental parts with a soft brush, as an 
old toothbrush, but use no more force 
than is necessary to avoid injuring 
the gilding. Wipe dry with chamois 
or a piece of soft woolen cloth or 
silk. 

Bronzed articles, not genuine 
bronze, require only dusting or wip- 
ing with a soft cloth. Washing will 
injure the bronzing. 

To clean copper boilers, pipes, etc., 
mix one tablespoonful of oxalic acid 
(poison), one tablespoonful of pow- 
dered pumice stone, and three tal^le- 
spoonfuls of water. Put into a pint 
bottle and shake well to dissolve. 
Apply with a flannel cloth, rinse with 
water, and polish with a dry cloth. 

Burnishing Powder. — To make a 
high polish for metals, mix 4 ounces 
of prepared chalk, 1| ounces of pipe 
clay, 1 ounce of white lead, i ounce of 
carbonate of magnesia, and i ounce of 
jeweler's rouge. 

TO CLEAN MARBLE, BRICK, AND 
STONE 

To Clean Marble. — To clean marble 
mantels, table tops, tops of bureaus, 
washstands, and other polished marble 
surfaces, wipe them with a cloth mois- 
tened in kerosene. 

Or mix 2 ounces of common soda, 1 
ounce of pumice stone, and 1 ounce of 
fine common salt, and dilute with 
water to the consistency of cream. 
Pour this mixture over the marble and 
let stand until all stains are removed. 
Afterwards wash the marble with salt 
and water, rinse, and wipe dry. 

Or mix soft soap and whiting to a 
thin paste, and apply to the marble 
by means of a soft brush. Let stand 
until fully dry, and wash off with 
lukewarm suds made of hard white 
or yellow soap. 

To Remove Iron Rust from Marble. 



— To remove iron stains from marble, 
dilute 1 part of oxalic acid with 10 
parts of alcohol, or 1 part of sul- 
phuric acid with 25 to 50 parts of al- 
cohol; cover the spot and let stand 
15 minutes to a half hour. Wash off 
with water containing aqua ammonia 
to stop the action of the acid. Re- 
peat if necessary. 

Or cover the spot thickly with salt 
and moisten with lemon juice. 

Or apply 1 part of nitric acid diluted 
with 25 parts of water, and rinse with 
aqua ammonia. 

To Clean Marble Steps. — To clean 
coarse marbles, as doorsteps, monu- 
ments, and the like, mix equal quan- 
tities of quicklime and potash lye and 
dilute with water to a thin cream. 
Apply with a brush, let stand twenty- 
four hours or more, and wash ofiF with 
hot soapsuds. 

To Remove Stains from Marble. — 
Cut a lemon in half and rub with it, 
or apply a saturated solution of oxalic 
acid. 

Or make a paste of equal parts of 
whiting and sal soda dissolved in 
water. Cover the stains, and let stand 
for several hours. Afterwards wash 
off with soapsuds. 

To Remove Oil Stains from Marble. 

— Apply common clay, starch, whit- 
ing, or prepared chalk, and saturate 
with gasoline or other petroleum 
product. Should these injure the pol- 
ish, scour with a moistened cloth 
dipped in pumice stone, and polish 
with whiting. 

Or mix with boiling water 2 ounces 
of soft soap, 2 ounces of caustic pot- 
ash, and 4. ounces of fuller's earth. 
Cover the spots thickly, and let stand 
for several hours. Rinse with clear 
water. 

To Clean Brick and Stone Walks. — 
To remove the green fungous growth , 
on brick or stone walks and walls ex- 
posed to moisture, pour over them 
boiling water in which potatoes or 
other vegetables have been cooked, 
provided that it docs not contain 
grease of any kind. Repeat if neces- 
sary. 

Or pour strong brine over the brick 
or stone, or scatter dry salt over it 
just before or after a rain. This will 
also kill any tufts of grass and weeds 



802 



HOUSEHOLD DISCOVERIES 



that come up between the bricks and 
stones, but care must be taken that it 
is not used in quantities sufficient to 
leach off into the soil and kill the ad- 
jacent grass of the lawn or the plants 
in flower beds. Hence use a small 
quantity of salt, and repeat if neces- 
sary. 

To Polish Stucco Work. — Let the 
stucco dry, then rub it down with a 
flat block of pumice stone. Follow 
with whiting and polish with tri])oli, 
using a piece of felt mounted on a 
block of wood. Wash down with 
soapsuds. 

To Polish Glass. — A scratched win- 
dow pane or a show-case top which 
has been roughened by use and par- 
tially lost its transparency may be 
polished by covering with a strong 
solution of potash lye applied by 
means of a brush. Let it dry, and 
polish with a moist cloth. Repeat if 
necessary. 

Or, if this is not effectual, polish 
with putty powder and water by 
means of a piece of felt. 

To Clean Papier-mache. — Wash 
with clean cold water, using a sponge 
or soft cloth. While still damp, cover 
it with dry flour and rub dry with a 
piece of woolen cloth or chamois. 

To Clean Gutta Perclia. — Dissolve 
with gentle heat a little hard white 
soap in an equal bulk of water, and 
stir into the soap jelly thus made an 
equal bulk of powdered charcoal. 
Scour the article with this, and polish 
with a dry cloth and finely powdered 
charcoal. 

CLEANING KITCHEN STOVES AND 
OTHER METALS 

To Clean Stoves. — First examine the 
stove or range to see if any parts need 
replacing. Make a note of these, 
and obtain new ones from the manu- 
facturers or some local merchant. 
Remove clinkers, clean the grate, fire- 
place, spaces under and over the oven, 
flues, etc. Dust off the top of the 
stove, and wash the outside with very 
hot water and soda applied with a 
stiff brush or a coarse cloth, or both. 

Suggestions for removing rust and 
polishing nickel and other ornaments, 
and for blacking and polishing the 



stove and preventing rust when not in 
use, will be found elsewhere. 

To Clean Grates. — Brush tiie dust 
from the grate with a stiff brush. 
Then mix 4 ounces of pure black 
lead with 1 pint of beer, add 2 ounces 
of hard white or yellow soap, bring all 
to a boil, and while hot apply this 
mixture with a paint brush. Allow 
it to cool, then polish with a hard 
brush or polishing mitten. 

Or, if the grate is much rusted, al- 
low the black lead to remain for a 
day or two. It will loosen the rust 
so that it can be scraped off. The 
grate may then be blacked and pol- 
ished. 

Or first scrub the grate with soap 
and water and apply rotten stone 
moistened with sweet oil. Black and 
polish. 

To Black Grates. — Melt 2J pounds 
of asphaltum and add 1 pound of 
boiled oil. Remove from the fire, and 
when cool add 2 quarts of spirits of 
turpentine, stirring vigorously. Ap- 
ply with a brush. 

To Prevent Rust. — Substances rec- 
ommended for preventing rust are 
various animal fats, as lard, suet, and 
tallow, and oils, as linseed oil, olive 
oil, vaseline, etc.; also black lead, 
paraffin, collodion, quicklime, gutta 
percha, varnish, pitch-tar paint, and 
various mixtures of these. The ob- 
ject in all cases is to prevent contact 
of the metal with the oxygen of the 
air, especially where there is mois- 
ture. 

The formation of rust is a process 
of combustion similar to that which 
takes place in breathing and in the 
burning of fuel and other combusti- 
bles. The oxygen of the air uniting 
w-ith iron forms a compound called 
ferrous oxide, which is iron rust. This 
action is very much hastened by mois- 
ture. Hence a coating of any oily, 
greasy, or sticky substance which will 
adhere to the metal without injuring 
it will prevent rust. Which of the 
following recipes is best will depend 
upon the article to be protected, and 
whether or not it is to be used or 
stored away. Such substances as col- 
lodion, paraffin, and black lead mixed 
with lard or other animal fat, boiled 
linseed oil, etc., can be used on small 



HOUSE CLEANING 



803 



polished articles, as steel tools, skates, 
and the like. They can be readily re- 
moved, when necessary, by washing. 

Paraffin, collodion, boiled linseed oil, 
and copal varnish may be applied to 
tools and other articles which are in 
process of use, the excess being wiped 
oflF with a dry cloth. Pitch-tar and 
paint can, of course, only be applied 
to coarser articles according to their 
several characters. 

Stoves — To Prevent Rust. — To 
protect from rust stoves and stove- 
pipes that are taken down in the 
spring and stored during the summer, 
apply kerosene with a brush or cloth. 
The crude oil is better for this pur- 
pose than the refined. It costs less 
and does not evaporate so quickly. 

Or melt 3 parts of lard with 1 part 
of rosin, and apply with a brush while 
warm. 

Or apply linseed oil, or a mixture 
of equal parts of linseed oil and kero- 
sene. 

Or a mixture of 4 parts of linseed 
oil, 4 parts of kerosene, and 1 part of 
turpentine. 

Apply the above mixtures in a thin 
coat while slightly warm. 

To Protect Stovepipes from Rust. — 
Shake the dirt and soot out of the in- 
side of the stovepipe, then insert an 
old broom and brush out as clean as 
possible. Paint the outside of the 
stovepipe with a coat of black paint, 
or apply any of the above rust-proof 
mixtures. 

Stovepipes rust on the inside as 
well as on the outside. Hold the pipe 
with an open end toward a good light, 
or reflect a light inside by means of a 
mirror. Affix a brush to a long han- 
dle and cover the inside of the pipe 
as well as the outside with oil or other 
rust preventives. 

To Keep Nickel Fittings from Rust- 
ing. — Remove the nickel fittings from 
the stove, cover them with any of the 
above preventives, wrap them in thin 
cloths, and lay them away until 
wanted. 

Or cover them with unslaked lime. 

Or, if badly rusted, go over the 
nickel fittings with aluminum paint. 

To Prevent Rust on Roofs. — To 
prevent rust on tin roofs and other 
exposed metal surfaces, bring to a 



boil 2 pounds of linseed-oil varnish. 
Stir into this a mixture of 2 ounces of 
black lead, 8 ounces of sulphide of 
lead, and 2 ounces of sulphide of zinc. 
Apply with a brush. 

Or paint exposed metal surfaces 
with a paint consisting of 30 parts of 
pure white lead, 8 parts of crude lin- 
seed oil, 2 parts of boiled linseed oil, 
and 1 part of spirits of turpentine. 
Apply two or more coats as 
needed. 

To Preserve Metals from Rust. — 
To preserve stoves, skates, sleigh run- 
ners, and other steel articles which are 
stored for a portion of the year, smear 
them with vaseline. 

Or paint them with lampblack mix- 
ed with equal quantities of boiled lin- 
seed oil and copal varnish. 

Or use powdered black lead and 
lard, melting the lard and stirring in 
the lead, and add a small piece of gum 
camphor. Apply while warm with a 
brush. 

Or melt paraffin, and apply while 
warm with a brush, sponge, or cloth. 

Or clean thoroughly and dust over 
with unslaked lime. 

Or plunge small articles into un- 
slaked lime. 

Or dip the articles in boiled linseed 
oil and allow it to dry on them. 

Or apply a coat of copal varnish. 

Or melt 5 pounds of beef or mut- 
ton suet, 1 pound of gutta percha, and 
1 gallon of neat's-foot oil or rape oil 
until dissolved. Mix thoroughly and 
apply when cold. 

Or coat with collodion dissolved in 
alcohol. 

Or wrap in zinc foil or store in zinc- 
lined boxes. 

Or mix 1 ounce of oil varnish with 
4 ounces of rectified spirits of turpen- 
tine and apply with a sponge. 

Or heat the articles and dip them 
in train oil. 

To Prevent Rust on Tinware. — 
Rub new tinware with fresh lard, and 
heat in the oven before using. This 
tends to make it rust ])roof. 

To Preserve Nails, etc.. from Rust. 
— To preserve from ru<;t nails, screws, 
hinges, and other hardware that will 
be exposed to water, heat them (but 
not enough to injure the temper) in 
an iron skillet over a fire and drop

them into train oil. This will pre- 
serve tlieni for many years. 

Or mix i pound of quiciilime in 1 
quart of water and allow it to settle. 
Pour off the clear liquid and add to 
the lime suflRcient olive oil to form a 
stiflf paste. Apply with a brusli to 
iron or steel articles to be stored. 

Or, for rough castings and fence 
wire, mix mineral pitch, coal tar, and 
sand in the proportion of 1 })ound 
each of coal tar and sand to ~'0 pounds 
of mineral pitch. Immerse the arti- 
cles in tlic mixture, remove them, and 
let them stand a day or more to 
harden. 

To Prevent Rust on Piano Wires. — 
Sprinkle piano wires with unslaked 
lime. 

Steel Table Knives. — Fill a flower 
pot or other deep receptacle with 
quicklime and into it plunge the 
blades of the knives. Do not allow 
the lime to touch the handles. 

To Remove Rust from Small Arti- 
cles. — Substances recommended for 
removing rust are muriatic acid, kero- 
sene, chloride of tin, and unslaked 
lime used with or without various 
abrasives, as sandpaper, emery paper, 
pumice stone, powdered brick, and the 
like. 

First immerse the articles in a hot 
solution of sal soda or soapsuds to 
free them from oil or grease. 

Or dilute muriatic acid with twice 
its own bulk of water and immerse 
the articles from a few minutes to 
several hours, according to the 
amount of rust. Remove and apply 
soap and water with a scrubbing 
brush. Repeat if necessary. Rinse, 
dry, and polish with oil and emery 
paper or other good abrasive. 

Or immerse the articles in kerosene 
oil for several hours, or as long as 
may be necessary. This loosens the 
rust so that it may be rubbed off with 
sandpaper or emery paper. But if 
the rust has etched dee])ly into the 
articles, they may have to be refin- 
ished. 

Or soften rust with sweet oil and 
rub with sandpaper. 

Or mix 2 parts of pumice stone with 
1 part of sulphur. Moisten with 
sweet oil and apj>ly with chamois. 
Or use emery and oil. 



Or immerse the articles in a satu- 
rated solution of chloride of tin over 
night, or as long as necessary. Rinse 
in clear water and polish with cham- 
ois. 

Or immerse them in olive oil, and 
polish with whiting or slaked lime by 
moistening a cloth or cliamois and 
di])j)ing it into the dry powder. 

To Clean Zinc. — Substances recom- 
mended for cleaning zinc are kero- 
sene, soft soap, salt and vinegar, vine- 
gar and alum, paraffin, coal ashes, 
sulphuric acid, turpentine, and vari- 
ous compounds of tliese. As zinc is 
not easily injured, these may all be 
used freely. Rub with a coarse cloth 
saturated with kerosene oil. 

Or heat 2 ounces of salt or 2 ounces 
of alum in 1 quart of vinegar and ap- 
ply hot. Wipe with a dry rag. 

Or dip a cotton cloth in melted par- 
affin and rub until the dirt is removed. 
Rinse with clean water and wipe 
dry. 

Or wet with cold vinegar, let stand 
for a few minutes, rinse, and wash. 

Or make a soap jelly by dissolving 
hard soap with twice its own bulk in 
water. Mix with sifted coal ashes to 
a stiflf paste. Apply with a moist 
cloth. 

Or mix dilute sulphuric acid (1 part 
of acid to 10 parts of water) with 
glycerin. 

Or mix 1 pint of linseed oil with 
4 ounces of turpentine. 

Or polish with bath brick. 

To Clean Nickel. — Substances rec- 
ommended for cleaning nickel are 
kerosene, jeweler's rouge, whiting, 
powdered borax, and alum. When 
not much soiled, use jeweler's rouge 
and vaseline mixed to a thin paste. 
Apply with flannel and polish with 
chamois. 

Or dampen a rag and dip in pow- 
dered borax. Or, if the articles are 
small and movable, boil in alum and 
water. 

Or rub with a cloth dipped in kero- 
sene. 

Or apply hot salt and vinegar. 

To Clean Brass. — Substances recom- 
mended for cleaning brass are vine- 
gar and salt, lemon juice, citric acid, 
oxalic acid, rotten stone, turpentine, 
alum, ammonia, sulphuric, nitric, or 



HOUSE CLEANING 



805 



muriatic acid, and various compounds 
of these. 

To clean brass kettles and other 
utensils, dissolve a tablespoonful of 
salt in a teacupful of vinegar and 
bring to a boil. Apply as hot as pos- 
sible to the brass with a scrubbing 
brush. 

Or apply a solution of oxalic acid 
with a scrubbing brush or cloth, using 
equal parts of oxalic acid and wa- 
ter. 

Or apply strong aqua ammonia with 
a scrubbing brush. 

Or dissolve 1 ounce of alum in 1 



pint of strong lye and apply with a 
scrubbing brush. 

To Polish Brass. — After removing 
tarnish with any of the above cleans- 
ers, wash the article with warm soap- 
suds made of any good, hard white 
soap, dry with a cloth, and polish 
with dry chamois or any good silver 
polish, as whiting, or the like. Finish 
by rubbing the articles with a cloth 
slightly moistened with vaseline. 
This will prevent tarnishing. 

Or coat with collodion dissolved in 
alcohol, or thin shellac applied by 
means of a camel's-hair brush.
