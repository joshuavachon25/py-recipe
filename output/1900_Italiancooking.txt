Introduction 



Before thinking about Italian cooking, it's as well to give 
some thoughts to the good foods native to that sunny 
country. 
And before getting down to the food itself, give some con- 
sideration to what, in Italy, is its essential accompaniment — 
good wine. From north to south whether one travels by road 
or by rail, one doesn't travel far without seeing stretches of 
vineyards, and from the delightful Soave, produced in the 
vicinity of Verona, to the slightly spicy Orvieto of the Umbrian 
Hills, down to the delicate Lachrima Christi with which the 
visitor to Naples, Pompeii and Amalfi is regaled, there's no 
excuse in Italy for stinting the wine with which to cook or 
with which to eat the finished dish. Not all Italian wines travel 
well enough to allow them to be brought across to our own 
country, but a little patient exploration of the Italian wine 
shops of Soho will result in a fairly lengthy list of Italian wines 
that can be purchased here in England at a price sufficiently 
reasonable as to make it not an extravagance to use them when 
suggested in the recipe for a truly Italian dish, or to form the 
highly agreeable habit of taking a glass or two of 'Vino' with 
one's Pasta or Ossobuco. Make the acquaintance of your 
Italian wine merchant; talk to him about his various wines, 
ask him to suggest good wines for certain dishes ; get him talking 
about the different wines to be met with in different parts 
of his beloved country — if he's a true Italian, his advice will 
be well worth taking, and the next time you visit his country 
you will order your wine by name, instead of mumbling some- 
thing about 'half a bottle of that red stuff"'. And in spite of the 
long list of 'named' varieties, your Italian wine merchant 
will probably point to the wisdom of buying a carafe of the 
local wine, for many of these local wines, though they do not 
travel well, are excellent when drunk in their own particular 
place of origin. 

Not only is Italy a country of wines, it is also a country of 
cheeses, cheeses of a staggering variety. There is no need at all 
in Italy to ruin an otherwise perfect dish by the addition of two 

[ 7 ] 



tablespoonfuls of grated 'mousetrap', nor is there any need in 
England nowadays to commit such a solecism when a fairly 
good range of Italian cheeses may be found in the best provision 
shops of most of our large towns. Where cheese for cooking 
is concerned, we may have to substitute Bel Paese, which travels 
well, for Mozzarella, which doesn't, and our own cream cheese 
for the Italian Ricotta which again doesn't care much for 
transportation, but where table cheeses are concerned, there's 
a wide variety from which to choose. 

And what of the olive groves, where the silvery-grey leaves 
of the slender gnarled trees give an other-world appearance 
to the landscape? Small wonder that so many truly Italian 
dishes are built upon a foundation of either the fruit, green 
or ripened to blackness, or the oil extracted from the fruit of 
these trees — and remember, the use of oil in cooking does not 
mean that the resulting dish will be oil-y — only the badly 
cooked dish merits that adjective. 

Wines, cheeses, olive oil, lemons, lemon juice and tomatoes 
(raw, cooked or rendered down into the puree or conserve we 
can now purchase in 'tooth-paste' tubes that allow one to use 
a little without wasting the balance), green, red, yellow and 
variegated peppers, purple egg plants, artichokes, and zucchini 
are but a few of the colourful basic foods of the peninsula, 
but they are enough to go on with. 

And why, so far, no word of pasta, that everpresent, ubi- 
quitous Italian dish? For the reason that Pasta, whatever it may 
be to-day, is said not originally to have been a native of the 
country, but is alleged to be one of the many wonders brought 
home by the 13th century explorer, Marco Polo, from his 
travels in China. Nevertheless, although Pasta, in its many 
shapes and forms, may not have started ofif as a true native 
of Italy, to-day it seems as much a part of the country as an 
operatic tenor, and anyone wanting to present a truly Italian 
meal must perforce learn a few of the ways of preparing and 
cooking Pasta. 

So much for the food and drink harvested from the land. 
What about the fruit of the seas that wash the shores of the 
long, indented coastline, all the strange and lovely fish and 
shellfish abounding in the waters? What of the colourful fish 
to be seen in the fish market in Venice, to mention but one 
of the famous markets? In most coastal towns of Italy fish is 
good and recipes for cooking it abound. English taste won't, 
of course, take kindly to all of them, and the mention of octopus 

, [ 8 1 



may bring forth a horrified shudder, but few EngUsh men or 
women look askance at a dish of scampi or red mullet, and these 
are but two of a great number of delicacies piscatorial. 

In the following pages an attempt has been made to offer 
to the English cook a selection of typical Italian dishes that can 
be cooked and enjoyed in her own country. It is a compilation 
rather than an invention, for to 'invent' four hundred 'original' 
Italian recipes would be not merely an impossible task but 
an insult to the established repertoire of Italian cooks.

Flavourings^ Trimmings^ 
Herbs and Spices used in Italian Cookery 



Here in England the catalogue of herbs in general use is 
small : mint for mint sauce, or for adding to the water 
in which we are cooking new potatoes or peas, parsley 
for garnishes or for an addition to white sauce, thyme and 
sage as ingredients for what is collectively known as 'stuffing' 
for pork, veal or a bird, while spices we tend to think of as an 
added ingredient to Christmas cake or Christmas pudding, 
and not too much of them to be used for that purpose. 

In the Italian kitchen, however, herbs and spices play a far 
more important part, and a chapter is not too much to devote 
to their nature and uses. Taking them alphabetically the follow- 
ing is a fairly comprehensive list: — 

BAY: Although it is possible to purchase dried bay leaves at 
most herbal stores and at some chemists' shops, their flavour 
is nothing to be compared with that of a freshly plucked leaf, 
and since the shrubs grow well in tubs and, except for ade- 
quate watering need little care or attention, why not grow your 
own? They make an attractive addition to any garden, 
and even in a small yard or balcony there is room for a small 
tub of bay. If your house stands far enough back from the 
street, a tub of bay each side of the front door is attractive, 
and at the same time provides a useful means of adding to 
your flavouring ingredients. 

A leaf of bay in a risotto — removed before serving — or 
in a casserole of meat or fish, or even as an added flavour 
to the Bechamel base for cream soups is an excellent idea. 

BASIL: Basil is a herb little known and used in this country, 
and one rarely to be met with in the English garden, yet its 
cultivation is not difficult. It grows in profusion in Southern 
Italy where it is used as a fragrant and welcome addition 
to most dishes where tomatoes are used, chopped finely — or 
preferably torn into fine shreds with the fingers — and added 
to a green salad, and it also takes its place as a delicate and 
unusual flavouring in some ^gg dishes and soups. 

— [ 12 ] 



In attempting to grow this delicious herb in an English 
garden, remember the heat and sunshine of Italy where it 
thrives, and choose a sunny corner of your plot or a sunny 
window-box for your experiment. If, in spite of all your care, 
it refuses to flourish, it is possible to buy the dried herb from 
most herb stores, but as with all dried leaf herbs, it is at 
best a poor substitute for the leaves of the growing plant. 

BORAGE: This is a herb we in England associate mainly with 
wine cups, but in parts of Italy it is used as a flavouring 
ingredient, sometimes it finds its way into the filling for 
ravioli, sometimes, finely chopped, a sprinkling is added to 
a green salad, and its flavour combines excellently with 
that of cucumbers. It is a plant that grows wild on our own 
Sussex Downs, but if these are inaccessible to you, it is possible 
to purchase it at some, though not all, herb shops. It is 
advisable to use it quickly after it is picked, as it has a ten- 
dency to wither quickly. 

BREADCRUMBS : It is an excellent idea to get into the habit 
of slicing thinly any left-over stale bread, drying it out in the 
bottom of the oven when baking, and when it is crisp grind- 
ing it into fine crumbs so that one is never without a jar of 
these ready at hand to be used as a coating for fried foods, 
or sprinkled, together with grated cheese, on top of a 
baked fish dish, or as a thickening ingredient for various 
stuffings. 

CELERY: The Italian climate does not appear to produce 
such a deliciously crisp ^eating' celery as we are accustomed 
to in this country, for which reason it rarely makes an appear- 
ance in its raw state in that country, but stalks and even 
the inner, tender leaves are used as flavouring ingredients 
in soups and stews. 

And here is a hint, not native to Italy, but worth remember- 
ing when celery is out of season. Instead of discarding the 
tougher, outer stalks, scrub these clean, wipe them dry, 
and cut into inch lengths. Spread on a tin and dry slowly — 
on the floor of a slow oven, or on top of your kitchen boiler. 
When quite dry, store in a screw-top jar, and use as a flavour- 
ing for soups when fresh celery is no longer available. The 
dried stalks can also be used as a flavouring ingredient in 
stews, but in this case it is best to tie them in a piece of 
muslin, so that they can be removed before the dish is 
served, as they are unattractive to the eye once they have 
been dried. 

[ 13 ] 



CHEESE: The variety of Italian 'table' cheeses Is extensive, 
but there are three 'cooking cheeses' the names of which 
appear time after time in Italian recipes. 

Of these three, the one best known to English cooks is 
Parmesan, the apparently high cost of which has alarmed more 
than one inexperienced housewife. Actually, in practice, 
this cheese works out not at all extravagantly, for its texture 
is so close, its flavour so concentrated that a very little of it 
when grated will produce sufficient to go a long way. Do not 
be tempted to go about the use of Parmesan the 'easy' way 
by purchasing it already ground. If you buy a small lump, 
even as little as two ounces in weight, and grate it freshly 
for each occasion, the flavour is richer and the cost less than 
if you rely on the commercially ground variety. 

Another cheese frequently mentioned is Mozzarella, 
a cheese made from buffalo milk, which unfortunately does 
not stand up to export, and consequently is not to be found 
in this country. It is fairly safe to substitute Bel Paese wherever 
a recipe mentions Mozzarella, and Bel Paese is obtainable 
in most good provision stores nowadays. 

The third cheese for which we in England need to think 
up a substitute is the sheep's milk cheese, Ricotta, met with 
in Southern Italy, a cheese that when fresh possesses a deli- 
ciously pungent flavour, but which, as with Mozzarella, 
does not stand up to export or long keeping. As its consistency 
is much^the same as our own sour milk cottage cheese, al- 
though the suggestion might sound like rank heresy to an 
Italian cook, cottage cheese is a fairly safe substitute where- 
ver Ricotta is prescribed. 
FENNEL: The root of this vegetable, thinly sliced, forms 
a frequent ingredient in salads, particularly in and around 
Venice, where I have often mistaken it at first bite for the 
heart of celery by reason of its somewhat similar appearance 
and texture. A second bite, however, disproves this, for there 
is a slight flavour of aniseed to fennel, which is absent from 
celery. 

Sliced thinly and sprinkled with salt and marinated in olive 
oil, fennel is sometimes served as a tit-bit at the end of a meal. 

We and the French use the leaves of fennel as a flavour- 
ing ingredient far more than does the Italian cook; take for 
example the delicious fennel sauce served as an adjunct to 
boiled fish — particularly salmon, and the French use of it as 
a flavouring for soups and stews. But, except for the districts 

[ 14 ] ■■ 



around Perugia and Gubbio and other cities of the province 
of Umbria, the stalk and leaves rarely find their way into 
Italian recipes. The Umbrians are fond of using fennel to 
flavour the stuffing used in roast sucking pig. 

FISH, TINNED OR SALTED: Anchovies, sardines, and tunny 
are frequent ingredients in Italian cookery, and it is a good 
idea to keep a stock of all three in your store cupboard. 

GARLIC: Yes, I know, we've all encountered that garlic-laden 
breath that has given rise to the legend that all Italian food 
is heavily laced with this odorous bulb, but legend notwith- 
standing, the best type of Italian cooking prescribes no more 
than a discreet use of this pungent member of the onion 
family. 

It is now possible to purchase a garlic crusher, made on 
the principle of a potato ricer, which enables a few drops 
of garlic juice to be added to a dish rather than a too-coarsely 
chopped clove. These presses are not cheap, but in labour- 
saving and flavour-refinement are a worthwhile investment. 
Certainly in and around Naples the use of garlic in dishes 
made from tomatoes and in soups is somewhat lavish, and 
the Neapolitans have a fondness for a dish of spaghetti 
flavoured with nothing more than good, fresh olive oil and 
garlic (here is an instance where your garlic press will give 
good service), but in the main, the use of garlic in Italian 
cooking is tempered with more restraint than rumour would 
have one believe. 

JUNIPER BERRIES: These strike an alien note in English 
minds where flavourings are concerned, but used discreetly, 
they form an interesting addition to the stuffing for pork 
or game. 

MARJORAM with which may be classed the elusive herb REG A NO, 
mentioned in so many Italian recipes, which is the wild marjoram 
similar to that which grows on our English Downs: 

Either the sweet marjoram, which is easily procurable 
from a herb shop, and which many of us grow in our gardens, 
or the wild is a welcome addition to many Italian dishes, 
to soups, and fish dishes, while a pinch in an Omelet aux 
fines herbes does not come amiss. As with all herbs, the fresh 
product, when obtainable, is infinitely preferable to the dried. 

MINT: In English cookery it usually means the mint sauce 
we eat with roast lamb, or a sprig or two to be boiled with 
new potatoes or with spring peas, and that, except for the 
Mint and Currant Pasty of Lancashire is the extent to which 

— [ 15 ] ■ 



we use It. The Italian cook makes a far wider use of the herb, 
particularly in and around Rome where it makes a fairly 
frequent appearance as a flavouring to soups, fish dishes, 
stews and salads. 

MUSHROOMS: Dried mushrooms — uninteresting though 
they may look hanging in strings in an Italian provision 
shop — are excellent used in small quantities in many soups 
and sauces. Before use they should first be soaked in warm 
water to soften them, and added to the dish 1 5 to 20 minutes 
before serving time. Overcooked they tend to lose their 
flavour and their texture is flabby. 

MYRTLE: The sweet-smelling myrtle of Southern Italy and 
Sicily has a stronger odour than our English variety. It is 
used less in Italy as a flavouring ingredient than on the island 
of Sardinia. 

OLIVE OIL: Frequently, all-too-frequently, alas, one meets 
the one-voyage-abroad traveller who complains of Italian 
food that it is 'much too oily' and one feels that the cooking of 
the country has once again been let down by the wrong kind 
of restaurant, for though the Italian cook uses olive oil lavishly 
for deep flaying, for salads, as a dressing for pasta, etc., provi- 
ded the oil and the cook are of first quality, the resulting 
dish is not oily in the objectionable sense, but rich, fragrant 
and delicious. 

The oil, however, must be olive oil of the best quality, and 
the temptation to substitute an anonymous product making 
its appearance under the name of 'frying oil' is one to be 
sternly resisted. Until you know your oils, it is advisable to 
spend your money on a named brand, the San Remo, for 
example. Get accustomed to using a good oil, to recognising 
its flavour and its cooking qualities, and later you may 
safely experiment with less well-known brands, but even then, 
insist that the oil you use must be olive oil, for just as the 
grey green foliage of the olive tree is an essential feature of the 
Italian landscape, so is the oil of its fruit an essential feature 
of Italian cookery. 

PARSLEY: It is used lavishly by Italian cooks, in soups, in 
salads, as an ingredient for the stuffings for meats, vegetables 
and the various forms of ravioli. If you are able to obtain 
a package of seeds of the true Italian parsley, try growing this 
instead of or in addition to our English variety. The leaf is 
flatter, thinner and less curly, so that for decorative purposes 
our English plant may be preferable, but the flavour of the 

[ 16 ] 



Italian parsley is considerably stronger and more poignant 
and for that reason I would recommend its use whenever 
possible. 

PINE NUTS: Do experiment with these, which are stocked by 
most vegetarian stores. A few chopped and added to a sour- 
sweet sauce, or used in place of almonds in cake-making, or 
instead of salted almonds to be served with drinks, will 
reward your courage. 

ROSEMARY: It is a herb we in England tend to think of in 
conjunction with the word 'Remembrance' or even, alas, 
as an ingredient for hair tonic; as a cooking ingredient it 
seems alien to our taste. However, chopped and used sparing- 
ly, since it is extremely pungent, either fresh or dried it is 
delicious sprinkled over saute potatoes during cooking, or 
again used cautiously to flavour a roast of veal, pork or lamb. 
In some of the Italian food markets you will see rolled fillets 
of meat already prepared for roasting and lavishly trimmed 
with this herb, but for English taste a little of it goes a fairly 
long way. 

This again is a herb that can be grown in one's own garden, 
and once again you'll find that a pinch of the fresh is worth 
a peck of the dried. 

SAFFRON: Is used mainly to produce a delicate yellow colour 
in some rice dishes, rather as in Cornwall it is used to produce 
a similar yellow tint in the saffron buns for which that county 
is noted. 

The dried stamens of the Autumn Crocus give us the true 
saffron and when one remembers that there are but three 
stamens to one flower, it can be realised what an extensive 
cultivation of the flower is necessary to produce a very little 
supply of saffron. If you are working with the dried stamens, 
take three or four of these, bruise them to a powder, and allow 
them to steep in a little hot water or soup for five or six min- 
utes before adding the strained liquid to the dish you are 
colouring. A quicker method is to purchase, literally, a thim- 
bleful of powdered saffron from one of the many Italian 
grocery stores to be found in Soho, and experiment by adding 
it a pinch at a time until you have obtained the desired colour. 
The flavour of saffron is so delicate that it is apt to be 
obscured by the stronger predominating flavours of the dish 
so that, preferable though it always is to use the true product, 
in this case, the substitution of a manufactured imitation 
does not materially affect the taste of the finished dish. 

[ 17 ] — — 



SAGE: Although this herb Is used less in Italian cooking than 
in our own, it is occasionally mentioned in a recipe. Because 
of its heavy under-taste, it is to many lovers of Italian cooking 
less attractive than basil or wild marjoram. 

SALT: Here is a case where I would urge you to forsake the 
nicely packed, beautifully ground commercial salt and to 
try the experiment of using the sea salt that can be purchased 
from the provisions department of most big stores. There are 
wooden salt mills that can oe used at table for adding this 
salt to cooked food, and once tried, these are usually pre- 
ferred to the trickle — or in our damp climate, the frequent 
lack-of- trickle — of commercial salt from a salt shaker or salt 
spoon. 

SPICES — a few of the most common. 

Cinnamon: Instead of confining its use to cakes and apple 
dishes, try the occasional pinch in a meat or vegetable dish. 
Cloves: Some Italian cookery books prescribe a pinch, a very 
modest pinch of this aromatip herb in stewed meat or meat 
sauces, and it is a tip worth trying. 

Coriander seeds: Keep a small jar of these in your spice cup- 
board and try one or two crushed as a flavouring for roast 
meat. 

Fennel seeds: These are used for flavouring far more than 
are the leaves and stalks of the raw plant and there is 
a specially delicious kind of salami, native to the city of 
Florence which takes its name 'finocchiona' from the fact 
that fennel seeds are predominant in its flavouring ingre- 
dients. 

In some parts of Italy and Sicily these seeds are used also as 
a flavouring for dried figs. 

Nutmeg: By all means continue to use this spice as a fla- 
vouring in milk dishes, but do experiment now and again 
with the wider use of it — a pinch in a meat stew, or in potato 
soup, or in any dish using spinach makes a welcome addition. 
Pepper: If you have not yet forsaken the commercially 
packaged ready ground pepper for the pleasure of grinding 
peppercorns in your own pepper mill, I cannot too strongly 
urge you to do so without delay. The improvement in flavour 
is almost unbelievable. 

TARRAGON: Is a herb we use little here in England, and for 
that reason it is not always easy to procure it in this country, 
but a leaf or two in a salad is a reward for the effort of run- 
ning it to earth, while the delicate flavour of tarragon vinegar 

[ 18 ] 



once acquired is preferred by many to the cruder taste of plain 
malt vinegar in salads. 

THTME: Although in Southern Italy and in Sicily one often 
comes across this herb growing wild, and after a sprinkling of 
rain finds the air drenched with its fragrance, it is not used as 
much in cooking as it is in England. It can, however, be used 
in restricted doses wherever oregano has been suggested if 
this is unobtainable or difficult to find. 

TO MA TOES: Where tomatoes are concerned, as a general rule 
the tinned varieties imported from Italy are preferable to our 
own fresh, local grown tomatoes. 

In any dish calHng for raw tomatoes, ours are excellent, but 
for cooked dishes, sauces, stews, soups, etc., I would every 
time recommend the tinned, peeled tomatoes. The tomatoes 
grown in Italy are larger and softer than those we grow here, 
their flavour is richer, and their colour deeper. One of the 
most popular and easily-obtainable brands is the CIRIO, but 
there are several others to be purchased in provision stores 
if this particular brand is not available. 

Concentrated tomato paste is another ingredient appearing 
again in Italian recipes, and after years of experimenting, 
a method of packaging this has been evolved that is practical 
and non-wasteful, for it can now be purchased in metal 
tubes, rather after the fashion of tooth-paste, so that when 
a little has been used, the tube can be sealed and the remain- 
der kept without danger of spoiling. Previously this paste 
used to appear in microscopic tins which had a fiendish knack 
of defeating even the best tin-opener, particularly if the cook 
happened to be working against time. Another former method 
of packaging was in small blocks wrapped in oiled paper, 
which, because of the high degree of concentration of the 
paste, necessitated a fair amount of pounding to reduce them 
to a usable consistency. It is still possible to purchase the 
paste in these forms, but the tubed variety is infinitely easier to 
handle. 

Do not fall into the trap of using this paste too lavishly, for 
while a little is excellent, too much can result in an over- 
flavouring that tends to kill the other flavours of any dish. 



[ 19 ] 



Antipasti 



Antipasti is the name given to the large variety of tit-bits, 
or hors d'oeuvres which, in a truly Italian household, 
are served as a prelude to pasta or soup. They may consist 
of a few wafer-thin slices of salami with a garnish of a couple of 
anchovies and a few black olives, or they may be considerably 
more elaborate, but whatever their nature they must be 
interesting to look at and appetising to taste. Some of the fol- 
lowing suggestions may fill you with apprehension ; for instance, 
boiled rice combined with grated carrots, or the slice of ham to 
be eaten with an ice cold slice of honeydew melon, or with 
a couple of ripe figs, but taste and try, and you'll probably come 
back for more. 



[ 20 ] 



ANTIPASTI MADE WITH RICE 

Really delicious antipasti can be concocted starting with a basis 
of plain boiled rice. 

Allow one tablespoonful of rice per person, and boil in salted 
water as directed under the heading of 'RICE'. Drain, and 
before it is quite cold season with a tablespoon of olive oil to 
each tablespoonful of uncooked rice, freshly ground black 
pepper, more salt if needed, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice 
or wine vinegar, plus a suspicion of finely chopped or crushed 
garlic, or a few shavings — very thin — of onion. Allow to 
become quite cold, then mix with any of the following, or 
a combination of two or three of them : 
Grated raw carrot — using half as much carrot as rice. 
Finely shredded raw green peppers — quantity as for carrot. 
Tunny fish broken small with a fork, equal quantities of fish 

and rice, and even better with the addition of one anchovy 

per tablespoonful of tunny fish. 
Finely chopped green olives, half as much as rice. 
Whole black olives, four or five per tablespoonful of rice. 
Minced cold chicken, equal quantities with rice. 
Mushrooms, raw or cooked in equal quantities. 

Fresh peeled shrimps or prawns, or if available, scampi, and to 
enhance these, add also a generous amount of freshly chopped 
parsley and a few cooked green peas or French beans. 

Chopped celery hearts, finely chopped fennel, finely sliced pre- 
served artichoke hearts in equal quantities with the rice, are 
three other alternatives, and with these try the addition of 
a few blanched and chopped almonds or pine nuts. 

Using the foregoing suggestions as a basis, you should be able 
to utilise left-over boiled rice to good advantage to produce 
an interesting hors d'oeuvre.

HARICOT OR BUTTER BEANS 
WITH FISH 

It is now possible to buy cooked butter beans in tins, or alterna- 
tively you may use the small white haricot beans, remembering 
however that these need soaking overnight, and then boiling 
for quite three hours the following day before they are tender. 
Whichever you decide to use, drain and marinate with a little 
under a tablespoonful of olive oil to a tablespoonful of beans, 
seasoning with salt, pepper and a little grated onion, and a little 
lemon juice or vinegar. Serve with equal quantities of flaked 
tunny fish, very cold. 



FENNEL ANTIPASTO 

head of fennel freshly ground 

3 tablespoons olive oil black pepper 

1 tablespoon lemon salt 
juice 

Wash a head of fennel, and soak in very cold water for two 
or three hours to allow it to become crisp. Slice thinly, and pile 
on a dish. With it hand the above dressing, into which the fen- 
nel is dipped before eating. Mix well together and serve cold. 



STUFFED FENNEL OR CELERY 

Wash the tender stalks of either of these, soak in cold water to 
allow them to become crisp, and before serving spread with 
cottage cheese, pounded anchovies, or a combination of the 
two. 



[ 22 ] 



OTHER WAYS WITH FENNEL 

Try combining thinly sliced fennel with thinly sliced crisp red 
radishes, or with thinly sliced unpeeled cucumber, in each case 
serving with a dressing of oil, lemon juice, pepper and salt, 
and a sprinkling of parsley, or mint finely chopped. 



FORTUNATA RUOCCO'S COLD 
PEPPER ANTIPASTO 

To each person allow: 

1 pepper (assorted colours make the finished dish 

more attractive) 
1 small teaspoonful best olive oil 
\ lemon 
a scraping of garlic 

Prepare your peppers by baking them whole in a fireproof dish 
placed in a larger dish with water halfway the height of the 
dish containing the peppers. Cook until the skins are wrinkled — 
about f hour Regulo 6. 

Cool slightly, peel off the thin outer skin, cut in two and re- 
move all the seeds. Slice thinly, and arrange on a serving dish, 
alternating the colours if you have been able to procure peppers 
of varied colours. Sprinkle with a scraping of garlic, and mari- 
nate with olive oil. Cool thoroughly before serving, and allow 
half a lemon per person when the finished dish is served. 



Hot Antipasti 

In addition to the galaxy of ideas for cold antipasti, or hors 
d'oeuvres, our Italian friends are fond of serving delicious little 
hot tit-bits that take the same place in the repast as the cold 
antipasti, and are a trifle less chilling on a cool day. Here are 
suggestions for some of these, which can also make their bow as 
rich little savouries to be served with drinks. 

[ 23 ] — 



CHICKEN TARTLETS 

Into a little rich Bechamel sauce, say a breakfastcupful, mix two 
tablespoons grated Parmesan, and quarter of a pound or more 
of cold cooked chicken, cut into small pieces, a few chopped 
mushrooms, and a slice of lean ham cut small. Mix well together, 
and use as a filling for tartlets. 



CHICKEN LIVER TARTLETS 

This time, impregnate your cupful of Bechamel with chopped 
chicken livers that have been cooked in a little Marsala, and to 
this add chopped mushrooms and seasonings. Mix well and 
use to fill small pastry tartlets. 



STUFFED MUSHROOMS 

Choose the small 'button' mushrooms, and allow three or four 
per person. 

Peel, and remove the stalks, setting the stalks aside to be added 
to soup stock or tomato sauce — DON'T waste them, whatever 
you do, they are far too good a flavouring. Saute the mushrooms 
in hot butter; meanwhile heat the contents of a small tin of 
anchovies, and when the mushrooms are cooked, place a curled 
anchovy inside each mushroom (the dark side is the side to 
receive the anchovy). Serve on toothpicks while still very hot. 



ANCHOVY TOAST 

TO SERVE 4 

Mash to a paste the contents of a small tin of anchovies, mixing 
with a little melted butter. Prepare some slices of bread about 
4 inches by 2 inches, and toast on one side only. On the other 
side spread the anchovy paste fairly thickly, sprinkle with grated 
Parmesan, and if liked a few chopped green olives. Brown under 
a hot grill and serve while piping hot. 

[ 24 ] 



HOT ANTIPASTO MADE WITH 
GREEN PEPPERS 

For each person allow: 

1 green pepper a suspicion of garlic 

1 peeled tomato a few drops of oil 

half a dozen capers from the anchovies 
two or more anchovies 

Remove the seeds from the peppers after having sliced off the 
top; stuff the cavity with one peeled tomato to each pepper, add 
a suspicion of garlic, two or more anchovies, half a dozen capers, 
and a few drops of the oil from the anchovies. Replace the top of 
each pepper. 

Place in a fire-proof deep dish, place in a medium-hot oven 
(Regulo 6), bake 45 minutes, basting at intervals with the 
balance of the oil from the tin of anchovies and a little hot 
water. 

Serve before or in place of soup, very hot. 

These are even more attractive if baked in individual fire- 
proof dishes. 



PANDORATO ALLA ROMANA 

Fried bread in the Roman fashion 

For this recipe, allow one or two half-inch slices of bread per 
person, and remove the crusts so that your slices are about 
3-inches square. 

You will need also a little warmed milk, one or two beaten 
eggs, depending on the number of slices, salt for seasoning, and 
oil for frying. 

An hour before starting to cook the slices, spread them in 
a single layer in a large flat dish and sprinkle them with warm 
milk, and then with sufficient beaten egg to soak the bread 
without making it soggy. Leave for an hour, then lift each slice 
gently with a spatula and fry in hot oil, first on one side then on 
the other until golden brown. 



[ 25 ] 



FRIED BREAD WITH 
ANCHOVIES 

Allow one or one and a half slices of bread per person; cut the 
slices about half an inch in thickness, remove the crusts and 
cut in two, lengthways. To each strip of bread allow a little 
BEL PAESE and half an anchovy and for the whole dish allow 
one or two eggs depending on the quantity of bread to be pre- 
pared. You will need also pepper and salt for seasoning, flour 
and oil for frying. 

On half the number of strips of bread spread a layer of BEL 
PAESE, and on that lay half an anchovy cut into small pieces. 
Season with pepper, and cover with the second slice. 

Heat the oil in a pan, and meanwhile dip the sandwiches 
first of all in water or a little milk, then in flour and finally in 
beaten egg, and fry quickly, first on one side and then on the 
other until golden brown. Serve very hot. 



PANDORATO ALLA CREMA DI 
FORMAGGIO 

Fried bread with cheese cream 

TO SERVE 4 

6 slices of bread, half an inch in thickness, with 
crusts removed and cut in two lengthways 

J lb. Gruyere cheese a walnut of butter 

J pint milk, or a lit- 2 eggs, separated 

tie more 

Whip the whites of eggs. Having prepared the strips of bread, 
dip them first in water or a little milk, then in flour, then in the 
whipped ^gg whites ; fry them in hot olive oil and when golden 
brown, lay in a flat fireproof dish and cover with the following 
cheese cream: 



[26 ] 



CHEESE CREAM FOR 

PANDORATO ALLA CREMA DI 

FORMAGGIO 

Cut the cheese in small pieces and place in a basin, and cover 
with the milk and leave for quite an hour, by the end of which 
time the cheese will have softened. Place it in a double boiler, 
add the beaten tgg yolks and stir with a wooden spoon until the 
whole is mixed well and has become a thick cream. Remove 
from the fire and stir in a knob of butter the size of a walnut. 

Spread this cream over the slices of fried bread and serve hot, 
garnished with sprigs of parsley. 



CROSTINI ALLA NAPOLITANA 

For each person allow two slices of bread, half an inch thick, 
with crusts removed and cut in two lengthways, and for each 
slice of bread allow one anchovy, a little BEL PAESE and half 
a tomato skinned and with the seeds removed. Allow a little 
oregano and pepper for seasoning. 

Fry the pieces of bread in hot oil on one side only, then ar- 
range in a single layer in a greased flat fireproof dish, fried side 
uppermost. On each slice spread a layer of BEL PAESE, half 
an anchovy cut small and a thin slice or two of tomato, and 
finally sprinkle with oregano and black pepper and a few drops 
of olive oil. 

Cook in a hot oven for ten minutes to allow the cheese to 
melt. Serve very hot. 



■[ 27 ] 



FRIED GREEN OLIVES 



3 — 4 large Spanish 
olives per person 

a thick slice of bread 
with the crust 
removed 



1 anchovy to each 

4 olives 
flour 

pepper and salt 
batter and oil for 

frying 



Peel the olives in a spiral so that you can remove the stone 
without breaking the flesh; soak the bread in a little water, 
and when it has become saturated, squeeze it dry in the 
hand; one slice should be sufficient for half a dozen anchovies. 
Remove the bones from the anchovies and pound them in 
a mortar, together with the bread, a few drops of olive oil and 
season them with freshly ground black pepper. When they are 
reduced to a paste, stuff" the cavities of the olives with the mix- 
ture, then dip in flour, and after that into a thin batter, and fry 
in hot olive oil. Drain well before serving.

Soups 



Soup forms an integral part of the daily diet of Italy, and 
the variety of Italian soups is considerable. 
Starting with a basis of chicken or meat stock, we have 
several plain, clear broths, of the consomme type, we have the 
ever-popular 'minestrone' type, where the stock is laced with an 
assortment of vegetables, eked out with dried peas or beans, and 
occasionally meat, and there are the various forms of 'pasta in 
brodo'. 

The Italian verb 'minestrare' — to serve up soup — derives 
from a similar Latin verb 'minestrare' which has the fuller 
meaning of 'putting food on the table', and it must be admitted 
that when a bowl of really good minestrone is placed before 
one, it has the appearance of a meal in itself, and could well 
serve as such, since there seems to be no end to the many 
ingredients that can find their way into this tasty and typically 
Italian dish, and all to its betterment. 

'Pasta in brodo' is the term applied to a generous portion 
of any of the large variety of pastas, cooked and served in hot 
broth, and taking the same place in the menu as the 'pasta 
asciutta', or dry pasta, cooked and served with various sauces, 
with which we have dealt in the section headed 'PASTA'. 

The variety of fish soups in the Italian cook's repertoire is 
far greater than in our own, and although cream soups and 
purees were originally more used in France than in Italy, with 
the passage of years a fairly large number of recipes for these 
have found their way into Italian cookery books, adapted and 
amended so that they now pass as very nearly native to the 
country of their adoption. 

Where the consommes, the minestre, and 'the pasta in brodo 
are concerned, although the family stockpot is not absolutely 
essential, it is strongly to be recommended if time and space 
permit. There are, it is true, some truly excellent chicken and 
beef bouillon cubes now obtainable in good provision stores, 
but the best of these is but a substitute for the broth resulting 
from the operation of a well-run stock-pot. For that reason I am 
starting the recipes of this section with 2 suggestions for Soup 
Stock. 

[ 29 ] 



STOCK FOR CLEAR SOUP 



2 pounds lean beef - shin 

of beef is excellent 
2 quarts cold water 
1 small onion 
a few stalks of celery 



4 cloves stuck into 

the onion 
6 whole peppercorns 
1 bay leaf 
salt, pepper, and 

a sprig of parsley 



Cut meat small, place in a stew pan and cover with cold water 
and bring slowly to the boil. Skim off any scum that rises to the 
top with a perforated spoon. Cover stewpan closely and let it 
simmer slowly for 6 hours or rather more. Strain, cool and re- 
move fat. Replace in pan, adding onion stuck with cloves and 
celery cut small, parsley, peppercorns and bayleaf. Simmer for 
a further 20 minutes after bringing to the boil. Add salt and 
pepper to taste. Strain through a cloth. 

This is an excellent basis for any clear soup, to which may be 
added 'pasta' for a dish of 'pasta in brodo', rice, or pearl barley. 



HOUSEHOLD STOCK POT 



3 quarts of cold 
water 

3 pounds of meat ; 
trimmings from 
steak, bones, etc. ^ 
and the addition 
of a ham bone or 
bacon knuckle 
bone is excellent 



1 small onion stuck 
with 4 cloves 

6 peppercorns 

parsley 

1 stalk celery, 
chopped small 

salt and pepper 



This is a stock that may be used as a foundation for many kinds 
of soups or sauces, for casserole dishes, etc. 

Place meat in a stewpan and cover with cold water and bring 
slowly to the boil, skimming well. Cover and simmer for 5 hours, 
or longer, add balance of ingredients and simmer one hour 
more. Add salt and pepper to taste, being chary of adding too 
much salt if you have among your meat a ham or bacon bone. 
Strain and set aside to cool. Remove the fat before using. 

Brought to the boil once daily, this stock will last for several 
days without spoiling. 

[ 30 ] 



CHICKEN BROTH 

TO SERVE 6 

1 boiling fowl 1 pinch thyme 

2 carrots a dash of nutmeg, 

1 onion salt and pepper to 

3 stalks celery taste 

1 tablespoon 4 quarts of water 
chopped parsley 

Place all ingredients in saucepan, bring to boil and skim ; lower 
heat and simmer for 2 hours or until fowl is tender. Remove 
fowl, strain soup through a fine sieve, allow to cool and remove 
fat. Reheat. This is a good basic soup for any of the varieties of 
pasta in brodo. 

Try it with Cappelletti filled with the following mixture : 

the breast of the boiled 1 Ggg plus one egg 

chicken chopped fine yolk 

J lb. cottage cheese 3 tablespoons grated 

2 tablespoons butter Parmesan 
salt and pepper 



Mix well together and use as filling for Cappelletti. Drop into 
boiling chicken broth five or six minutes before serving. 

Where cream soups are concerned the starting point is a good, 
rich Bechamel sauce, thinner than used when intended purely 
as a sauce, but made with care and using the best ingredients, 
butter, flour, milk and seasonings. The following is a good, 
reliable recipe for a Bechamel to be used as a basis for cream 
soup to serve four people: 

IJ to 2 ounces butter 1^ pints hot milk 

2 tablespoons flour pepper and salt 

Melt the butter in a small saucepan or in the top of your double 
boiler, but do not allow it to brown. Add the flour and blend 
well together, stirring constantly to prevent its going lumpy. 
Add the hot milk slowly, continuing to stir. When thickened, 
allow to cook very slowly for a further 15 minutes, otherwise 
the taste of the flour will predominate. Add a little extra milk 
if it looks like becoming too thick, and if you are unfortunate 

[ 31 ] ■ 



enough to have it go lumpy, do not hesitate to pass it through 
a strainer, though if the flour and butter are well blended and 
the mixture is stirred constantly lumps should be conspicuous 
by their absence. 

Once your Bechamel is properly blended and while it is 
'maturing' in the top of your double boiler, you have time to 
prepare the vegetables for the particular cream soup you have 
in mind. 

A time and washing-up saver is to make the B6chamel from 
start to finish in the top of your double boiler, rather than using 
a separate saucepan for the preliminary cooking and then 
transferring it to the top of the double boiler once the blending 
is completed. 

One small and permissible economy that is often an improve- 
ment in flavour is to eke out the quantity of milk by substitut- 
ing for one-third or one-quarter of it the hot water from a sauce- 
pan of cooking vegetables. Potato water is excellent; so is 
the water in which Brussels sprouts or celery are being cooked, 
but here it is as well to test the liquid for saltiness before adding 
it to the Bechamel, rejecting it if it is too highly salted, unless 
you are prepared to eat an over-salted soup.

A SLIGHTLY RICHER 
SPINACH SOUP 

Proceed as directed in previous recipe, but at the end of 30 min- 
utes cooking* add the following mixture : 

2 yolks of eggs, salt and pepper 

lightly beaten to taste 

2 tablespoons 

grated Parmesan 

Blend together and stir into boiling soup, allowing eggs to 
curdle slightly and serve immediately. 



ZUPPA PAVESE 

TO SERVE 4 

For this really nourishing 'meal in itself soup, you need a quart 
of clear chicken broth, into which at the end of its cooking 
time one egg at a time is thrown into the boiling soup for each 
consumer, stirred rapidly while it 'poaches', and removed to its 
individual soup bowl while the other eggs are similarly treated. 



ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR 
ZUPPA PAVESE 

If you do not mind your eggs very lightly poached, place 
a half-inch slice of toasted French bread in each individual 
soup bowl, and on to it break an egg very carefully so as not 
to break the yolk. Over this pour the boiling soup, and serve 
immediately.

FISH SOUPS 

We in England are not given to preparing fish soups, but in 
Southern France and in Italy these are immensely popular, 
and for that reason, a few recipes ought rightly to appear in any 
compendium of Italian cooking. 

Where your Italian cook says casually 'take a selection of 
fish', it has to be remembered that in his selection can be 
included a great many fish that are not native to our waters, 
nor easily obtainable in this country, such as octopus, lampreys 
(a variety of eel), calamari or squid, scampi. But we in England 
can still, given a little ingenuity, produce 'a selection of fish' 
that should produce a fish soup that is tasty and nourishing. 
Try combining sole with prawns or shrimps, a few scallops, 
a little smoked haddock, or smoked cod fillet — just let your 
imagination work and let your eye wander around the fishmon- 
ger's slab.

ZUPPA DI PESCE DEI PESCATORI 
DI POZZUOLI 

Fish soup made by the Fishermen of Pozzuoli 

From Pozzuoli, once one of the chief commercial ports of the 
Mediterranean in the days of Roman domination, and previ- 
ously one of the most important Greek cities of the region, and 
now not much more than a fishing village, the fishing fleet 
goes out each year for a fishing season in the waters of Santa 
Marinella. The villagers help the fishermen with their nets, 
and it is the custom for the fishermen to prepare, at sea, 
a delicious fish soup, which they share with the villagers. 
This is a soup you won't be able to make at home, one you 
won't be able to taste, unless you happen one day to be lucky 
enough to join this fishing fleet during their summer migration 
from Pozzuoli to Santa Marinella. But imagine the scene, 
the rough old-fashioned stove on board the boat, the earthen- 
ware pot in which, with plenty of water, an assortment of 
freshly caught and cleaned fish is cooked, with a few tomatoes, 
a clove or two or garlic, a few spoonfuls of oil, and a coarsely 
chopped red pepper; cooked together for twenty minutes or 
so, then served in earthenware soup plates, with lumps of home- 
baked bread brought by the villagers to the fishing fleet.

Pasta 



The Italian term Pasta covers a multitude of various 
shapes and forms of what we in England tend to lump 
together in our minds under the heading of Macaroni 
or Spaghetti. 

For centuries now Pasta has formed an integral part of the 
Italian diet, but whether or not it originated in that country 
is open to question. One theory is that it was among the many 
curiosities and wonders brought back by the traveller Marco 
Polo when he returned to Italy during the 13th Century after 
years of travel in the Orient, and in an account of his travels 
there is a description of the Chinese making a kind of dough 
which they cut in strips and dried in the sun, which strips he 
refers to by the ItaHan name o^ Lasagne, the name used to this 
day in Italy for one of the broad, flat ribbon-type Pastas. 

Earlier than Marco Polo, however, there is a reference to 
Pasta in Italian literature, in the Life of the Blessed Hermit 
William, a holy man who lived around the year 1200, which 
rather discounts the Marco Polo legend. 

It looks as though we are safe to assume that Macaroni has 
as good a chance of being native to Italy as Noodles have of 
being of Chinese origin ; the name given to the kind of Pasta 
matters less for the purpose of this book than the various ways 
of cooking the product. 

A word first of all about the various types of Pasta to be met 
with in Italy. Starting with the fine string-like vermicelli, too 
fine to have a bore through its centre, the tubular types come 
in all widths from the regular and familiar Macaroni and Spaghet- 
ti, to the three-inch lengths of Canneloni, three-quarters of an 
inch in diameter which, after a preliminary cooking in boiUng 
water are stuffed and re-cooked in various ways, and served 
up with sauce, or with cheese and butter. 

There are the fancy shapes of Pasta, Shells, Elbows, Cart- 
wheels, Twists, even Alphabet Letters, and there are the various 
flat types, the narrow Noodles, the broader Tagliarellini, progress- 
ing to the broad Lasagne, and there are also the tiny rice-type 
grains known as Pastina, and small star-shapes used as a garnish 
for soups. The variety is infinite and the possibilities of cooking 
the various types into tempting dishes are endless. 

[ 49 ] 



Cooking Procedures 

Provided one remembers a few simple rules, nothing could be 
much simpler than the cooking of Pasta. 

1. See to it that you use a large utensil, a really capacious 
saucepan in which is an ample quantity of really boiling 
water — allow at least a gallon of boiling water per pound 
of pasta, and to each gallon add a tablespoonful of cooking 
salt. Before attempting to add the Pasta, see that the water 
is at a proper boil, and add the Pasta slowly so as not to let 
the water go off the boil, for once the temperature of the 
water drops below boiling point you are running the risk 
of having your Pasta turn into a soft, rubbery mass, instead 
of the desired separate strands or pieces, depending on which 
variety of Pasta you are cooking. 

If you are using the long, uncut Spaghetti or Macaroni, 
don't spoil the Italian appearance of your finished dish by 
breaking the Pasta into shorter lengths; don't get alarmed if at 
first the long ends stick out of your saucepan of water, once 
the submerged part has been heated through it will soften 
sufficiently for you to be able to persuade the long ends to 
follow suit. 

One reason for the emphasis on using a large enough 
saucepan is the need to allow for the 'frothing' that takes 
place when once the Pasta itself reaches boiling point ; lower 
your heat a trifle when this occurs, but not sufficiently to let 
the water drop below boiling point. From time to time run 
a fork or spoon around your saucepan to loosen any stray 
ends of Pasta that may adhere to the bottom or sides of the 
utensil. 

2. Whatever you do, don't fall into the error of over-cooking 
your Pasta, and where cooking time is concerned, you may 
have to go through a period of trial and error before you 
discover the correct cooking time for your own particular 
taste. 

The true Italian likes to be able to bite his cooked Pasta: 
he will tell you it must be 'al dente' (to suit the tooth), 
but while it must certainly not be soft enough to dissolve in 
the mouth, it must need only the tenderest of 'bites', such as 
you might give to — shall we say — a piece of Shrove Tuesday 
pancake. The cooking time will vary with the different 
varieties and thicknesses o^ Pasta, and it is a fairly safe maxim 
in the early days of Pasta-coo\dng to study the instructions 

[ 50 ] 



given on the package of whichever type you choose, and to 
cook your Pasta a minute or so less than the time suggested, 
then fish out a small piece and test it for yourself either by 
biting through it, or by pressing it between two fingers. 
A few experimental 'trial runs' will soon give you a guide 
to your own best cooking times. The following table will 
be helpful in a broad sense, but your own experience will 
eventually stand you in better stead than any instructions. 



3. TABLE OF COOKING TIMES 

(Approximate only) 

Ordinary spaghetti 8 — 12 minutes 

Very thin spaghetti, vermicelli 6 — 10 minutes 

Long macaroni 10 — 12 minutes 

Macaroni shells, wagon wheels etc 8 — 12 minutes 

Broad noodles such as lasagne 6 — 9 minutes 

Medium noodles — tagliatelle 4 — 6 minutes 

Alphabet macaroni, pastina (the ricelike 

macaroni used in soup), small stars, etc. 5 — 7 minutes 
Rigatoni or gavatoni (very large macaroni) 10 — 12 minutes 

And remember, the home-made Pasta needs usually no more 
than half the length of time to cook in comparison with 
the bought varieties. 

4. To make sure that the cooked Pasta will have no slimy outer 
covering, it is an excellent idea to 'blanch' it as soon as it is 
cooked by removing it from the heat, and before draining 
it through a colander, adding a cupful of cold water to the 
boiling mass. Stir rapidly after the addition of cold water, 
then drain immediately through a colander, and, once 
drained, piled on a warm dish. 

5. Having transferred your Pasta to a warmed dish or bowl, 
add whatever Sauce you have prepared and serve imjnedi- 
ately, handing at the same time a bowl of grated Parmesan 
cheese, to be added to the taste of the consumer. 



[ 51 ] 



How Much Pasta Per Person? 

It is difficult to suggest quantities of Pasta per person, for while 
one pound of pasta might be ample for half a dozen people, 
there are addicts to whom a personal share of half a pound 
might not be too much, while others might abstain from tack- 
ling more than two ounces. A fairly 'safe' allowance is three 
ounces per person, plus an added three or four ounces for every 
sixth person, to allow for that little more an addict might 
demand. 

The following recipes will give you an idea of some of the 
many ways you can serve this typically Italian food once you 
have mastered the simple art of preparing your Pasta by its 
initial cooking in boiling water. 

These all come under the category of Pasta asciutta (Dry 
Pasta) to distinguish them from Pasta in Brodo, or Pasta served 
as an addition and an essential ingredient of certain broths 
and soups. 



A RECIPE FOR 
HOME-MADE PASTA 

Although there are excellent commercial brands of pasta in 
the various shapes and sizes, if you are a good pastry maker 
and have time to experiment, you may care to try your hand 
at making pasta for yourself. If you do, remember that the 
cooking time for the home-made variety is considerably less 
than that required for the packaged types — 5 to 7 minutes is 
all that is necessary. 

You will need a fairly large pastry board, and a longer-than- 
usual rolling pin. 

The following quantities will give you sufficient tagliatelle, 
the most usual type of home-made pasta, for six people. 

1 lb. flour a pinch of salt 

2 or preferably lukewarm water 
3 eggs 



[ 52 ] 



Pile your flour in a mound on your pastry board, making 
a well in the middle into which break your eggs, adding salt, 
and to start with a couple of tablespoons of lukewarm water. 
Fold the flour over the eggs and water and knead until the 
liquid is used up. If the paste is too stiff", add a little more 
water, but be careful not to 'drown' it. When the paste can be 
formed into a fairly solid ball, its consistency is right. You 
should now knead it, flouring your hands lightly from time 
to time, and flouring the board, for at least ten minutes ; then, 
dividing it into two portions start the rolling process. It will 
need quite ten rollings and the board and roller should be 
lightly floured between rollings. Finally it should be thin 
enough, metaphorically speaking, to read the newspaper 
through it. Spread a floured cloth over the back of a chair 
and lay the paste over it while you proceed similarly with the 
other half. When both sheets are rolled thin, leave them to dry 
out for half an hour, after which roll them up as you would 
a Swiss roll, or pinwheel biscuit mixture, and with a sharp 
knife cut across the roll at intervals of a quarter of an inch or 
less. Lay them on a floured cloth until you are ready to cook 
your tagliatelle, and remember, 5 to 7 minutes in boiling salted 
water will be ample. 

A useful hint — if you have difficulty in finding a really 
long roller for pasta, a length of broomstick makes an excellent 
one, and for drying the pasta, again a length of broomstick 
resting on two chairbacks, so that the pasta can hang over 
a cloth draped over the broomstick, .is| a iuseful dodge to re- 
member.

SPAGHETTI WITH ANCHOVIES 

TO SERVE 4 

1 lb. spaghetti or 1 small tin anchovies 
'shells' (about a dozen 

just under quarter fillets) 

of a pint of good 8 tablespoons grated 
olive oil Parmesan cheese 

1 clove garlic salt and pepper 

Heat your oil in a heavy frying pan, and when hot add garlic, 
crushed, and fry until it is brown, then remove. Chop anchovies 
into short lengths, add to hot oil and cook for a couple of min- 
utes, stirring with a wooden spoon. Add plenty of black pep- 
per, but add salt with caution, remembering the saltiness of 
anchovies. Add this to a dish of cooked and drained spaghetti, 
topping with the grated Parmesan cheese, and serve immedi- 
ately. 



SPAGHETTI WITH FRESH 
FENNEL SAUCE 

TO SERVE 4 OR 5 

1 lb. spaghetti 1 lb. fennel 

4 tablespoons olive 1 large or 2 small 

oil onions 

1 cup cold water 1 lb. fresh sardines, 
6 ozs. dried pilchards or 

*• breadcrumbs sprats 

1 tablespoon pine 1 tablespoon sul- 

nuts or blanched tanas or seedless 

almonds raisins 

Clean and bone fish. 

Clean fennel and cook for 15 minutes in about a quart of 
boiling water. Drain and chop small. 

Heat olive oil in a stewpan and cook in it the chopped 

[ 61 ] 



onion until it is a golden colour, add fish, cook gently for 10 min- 
utes, stirring frequently; add fennel, sultanas and nuts, cold 
water and seasoning and allow to simmer gently for 10 
minutes. 

Place breadcrumbs on a fireproof plate below a hot grill for 
a few seconds to brown. 

Meanwhile cook the spaghetti in the approved method. 
When cooked and drained, place in deep, warmed dish, pour 
over half the fish and fennel sauce and half the breadcrumbs 
and mix well. Then pile on balance of fennel mixture and 
top with remainder of breadcrumbs and serve very hot. 



MACARONI WITH BROCCOLI 

TO SERVE 4 

1 lb. elbow 1 lb. young 

macaroni broccoli 

J pint olive oil 

While the macaroni is cooking, clean the broccoli, break into 
small pieces, and cook 10 minutes in boiling salted water. 
Heat oil, in a heavy frying pan, drain and add broccoli, and 
fry lightly for 3 or 4 minutes. 

Grease a casserole, sprinkle with grated Parmesan. Pile into 
this the cooked and drained macaroni, and over it pour the 
broccoli and oil. Mix well. Sprinkle with more grated Parme- 
san, and place in a hot oven for 5 minutes. Serve very hot. 



SPAGHETTI WITH BACON, 
EGG, AND ONION 

TO SERVE 4 

3 to 4 ozs. of 4 rashers back bacon 

spaghetti per 4 eggs 

person 4 medium sized 

onions 

While you are cooking your spaghetti in the approved manner, 
peel and chop your onions finely and fry them to a light 
golden hue in a heavy frying pan with olive oil or butter; 



[ 62 ] 



when they are evenly coloured a pale gold, add your rashers 
cut into small pieces. By the time these are cooked your spa- 
ghetti should be ready for blanching and draining. When 
drained, add it to the bacon and onion in the pan, break the 
eggs on to the mixture, stir rapidly with a wooden spoon, and 
serve immediately the eggs have begun to thicken, a matter 
of a few seconds. Freshly ground black pepper is a necessary 
adjunct to this dish, as is a dish of freshly grated Parmesan 
cheese to be handed to the consumers and added to individual 
taste. 

LASAGNE VERDI 

These are the pale green strips of pasta, cut in oblongs as large 
as 3 inches by 2 inches, and although it is possible and permis- 
sible to use in their place the green ribbon noodles obtainable 
in most shops that sell pasta, you may, if you are successful 
with your home-made tagliatelle, wish to experiment with this 
refinement of pasta. 

For six people the quantities are the same as those for taglia- 
telle, except that instead of lukewarm water for mixing, you 
need 3 ounces of pureed spinach (which is weighed after, not 
before cooking, remember). 

Start again with your pound of flour heaped on a board, with 
a well made in the centre into which you break three eggs. 
After blending these with the flour, work in the spinach, and 
proceed with your kneading, rolling, drying and cutting as you 
did for the tagliatelle, except that instead of cutting the pasta 
into strips, you cut it into rather large, flat oblongs. 

Using either your home-made oblongs of lasagne, or a pound 
of bought green noodles, you can make one of the most famous 
pasta dishes of all : 




[ 63 ] 



LASAGNE AL FORNO 

TO SERVE 6 

2 tablespoons olive 1 tablespoon tomato 

oil paste 

1 lb. minced beef 1 lb. lasagne or 

1 medium size onion, green noodles 

chopped finely f to 1 lb. Mozzarella 

1 crushed clove of or Bel Paese cheese 

garlic 3 tablespoons grated 

1 pint water Parmesan 

Heat oil in a heavy frying pan, add the onion and garlic, and 
when slightly browned, add and brown the minced meat. 
Blend the tomato paste with a little water, pepper and salt, 
dilute with the balance of the water and pour slowly over the 
meat; cover and allow to simmer gently for 1 J hours. 

Take 1 lb. lasagne and cook in rapidly boiling salted water, 
5 to 7 minutes if the lasagne is home-made, 15 minutes if com- 
mercially packaged. Blanch and drain. 

Grease an oven glass or earthenware casserole, and in it lay 
a layer of the cooked lasagne, a layer of meat sauce and a layer 
of Mozzarella or failing this of Bel Paese. Continue filling the 
dish in layers until all the ingredients are used up, finishing 
with the balance of the sauce poured over the finished dish, 
which should be topped with grated Parmesan. Bake for 20 
minutes in medium oven.

CANNELLONI FILLED WITH 
CHEESE AND SAUSAGE 

TO SERVE 4 

Although it is possible to buy the large 'channel' macaroni, 
and after a preliminary cooking to fill them with the filling 
mixture, the home-made variety is far preferable, and once again 
the recipe for pasta given under Tagliatelle may be used. But 
when it has had its final rolling it must be cut into oblongs about 
4 inches by 3 inches, and cooked, a few at a time, in boiling 
salted water for four or five minutes, removed gently with 
a perforated spoon so as not to break them, and allowed to cool. 
For four people allow 20 to 24 cannelloni. 

Filling: 

I lb. cottage ^ lb. sausages 

cheese | cup tomato sauce 

grated Parmesan (see 'SAUCES') 

Prick the sausages and place them in a pan, cover with water, 
heat and allow to cook until the water has evaporated, then let 
the sausages remain a few minutes in the fat that will have 
escaped from them in the cooking. Cool slightly, skin and mash 
the filling and mix with the cheese. 

Place a little filling, about a tablespoonful, in the centre of 
each piece of pasta, and roll up into a tube. Grease a flat fire- 
proof dish well and in it place the cannelloni side by side, and 
over them pour tomato sauce, not quite sufficient to cover them ; 
dot with butter and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese, and 
place in moderate oven for 15 minutes before serving. 



[ 66 ] 



Ravioli & Gnocchi 



Having mastered the cooking of pasta of the macaroni 
and spaghetti variety, let us now proceed to the more 
involved types known broadly as 'ravioli' and 'gnocchi.* 

Both may be made at home, and after a little practice made 
well, and although it is possible to purchase both types ready- 
made and needing only to be heated and added to a sauce, if 
there is time available to make one's own ravioli or gnocchi, 
the results are well worth while. 

Ravioli is the term loosely applied to the several varieties of 
little envelopes of paste filled with various forms of stuffing, 
and served either, like 'pasta asciutta', with a tomato or meat 
sauce, or, like 'pasta in brodo' in a clear consomme rather after 
the style of the Jewish 'kraplech', or the Chinese *pork pellets'. 

Once you have become expert in the art of making tagliatelle 
at home, you may, if you wish, use the same recipe for your 
ravioli, agnolotti, anolini, tortellini, or cappelletti, to give a 
few of the various names given to the many types of filled 
pasta. But when your paste has been rolled as thin as possible 
(remember, thin enough for you to be able to read the news- 
paper — or at least the headlines — through it), instead of 
rolling it into a roll as you have done when making tagliatelle, 
keep it in two large, flat sheets, or, supposing your pastry board 
is on the small size, a greater number of small sheets of thin 
pasta. 

As each sheet is rolled to the desired thinness, spread it on 
a clean cloth, and keep it covered with another cloth, so as to 
prevent its going crusty and becoming too breakable to handle. 

When your paste is made and the filling you intend using is 
prepared, spread a sheet of the paste on to a floured pastry 
board, and dot with the filling at regular intervals, say a tea- 
spoonful of filling at intervals of about 1 J to 2 inches. Cover 
lightly with the second sheet of paste, after having brushed the 
'walks' between the lines of filling with beaten ^gg to ensure 
that the second sheet of paste will close down over the filling. 
You may then either use a small round cutter, or, less wastefully, 
run a pastry wheel between the fillings so that you have a series 
of little filled envelopes of paste. Transfer these to a floured 
dish, being careful not to let them overlap, and cover with 
a floured cloth or paper until you are ready to cook them. 

[ 67 ] 



These can be made overnight if wished. 

To cook, have ready a large pan of boiling salted water and 
transfer your envelopes of pasta one at a time, until all are in 
the water, allowing them to cook for four or five minutes or 
until they rise to the top of the pan. Remove them one at a time 
with a perforated spoon or slice, place in a heated dish, and 
serve with a generous helping of melted butter and grated 
Parmesan, or with any preferred sauce. These little filled enve- 
lopes are equally delicious served in a clear consomme, as one 
more form of pasta in brodo. 

Another and slightly richer paste for ravioli and its kindred 
pastas can be made as follows: 

f lb. flour I pint or slightly less 

2 eggs warm water 

1 oz. butter pinch salt 

Sift flour and salt together. Place on a board and make a well 
into which break the eggs. When you have kneaded them into 
the flour, add the softened butter, and gradually sufficient 
lukewarm water to make a dough. Knead until smooth and 
easy to handle ; cover and allow to stand for ten to fifteen min- 
utes before dividing into two portions and rolling very thin on 
a lightly floured board, remembering to flour the paste lightly 
between each of its several rollings.

cook in boiling salted water in deep saucepan for 5 or 6 minutes, 
or until the envelopes of pasta rise to the top of the boiling 
water. Transfer carefully with perforated spoon to a hot dish, 
serve with Tomato Sauce (see under section for SAUCES) and 
when serving hand a bowl of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

chopped meat, and allow to cook for five or six minutes, add 
the wine, and cook for another twenty minutes ; cool, and then 
add the beaten egg, Parmesan and seasonings; blend well, 
and use as a filling for ravioli, or for cappelletti (little hats), 
which latter are 2 J-inch rounds of ravioli paste, in the centre 
of which is placed a teaspoonful of filling, after which the paste 
is folded over and sealed at the edges with a fork.

CAPPELLETTI IN BRODO 

'Little hats in soup^ 

Make cappelletti as just described, heat clear chicken broth to 
boiHng point, drop in your 'little hats*, and allow to cook for 
five to seven minutes before serving. 



BACON AND SAUSAGE FILLING 

TO SERVE 6 

6 rashers lean bacon pepper and salt 

J lb. Mortadella a pinch of nutmeg 

Pass chopped bacon and sausage twice through mincer, blend 
with beaten egg, add seasonings and use to fill ravioli or cap- 
pelletti. This is an excellent filling for yet one more variety of 
pasta in brodo when cooked for five or six minutes in boiling 
clear soup. 



Gnocchi 

Although Gnocchi is placed at the end of the various forms of 
pasta, it is about the easiest form to make at home, for it re- 
quires neither rolling nor filling and consists merely of little 
rolls, croquettes or circles of pasta, various recipes for which 
follow. 



[ 71 ] 



POTATO GNOCCHI 

TO SERVE 4 

2 lbs. raw potatoes J oz. butter 

J lb. flour salt and pepper to 

2 eggs taste 

Boil potatoes in salted water for 20 minutes, drain and mash 
with the butter; gradually incorporate the flour and beaten 
eggs and seasoning. Roll between floured hands into rolls the 
thickness of your finger and cut into pieces an inch long or 
slightly less. Have ready a pan of boiling salted water, and drop 
the gnocchi gently into the pan one by one, boiling for 3 or 4 
minutes until they rise to the top — the water should boil only 
gently, not furiously. Transfer when cooked in a perforated 
spoon on to a heated greased fireproof dish, dot with butter and 
place in a warm oven long enough to allow the butter to melt. 
Serve plain, or with a meat or tomato sauce (see under 'SAU- 
CES'). 



SEMOLINA GNOCCHI 

TO SERVE 6 

1 J pints milk J lb. semolina 

yolks of 2 eggs IJ oz. butter 

3 or 4 ozs. grated a pinch of nutmeg 
Parmesan 

Heat milk, and add semolina slowly, stirring constantly and 
cooking slowly until thick. Remove from fire, add beaten yolks 
of eggs, grated cheese and butter and seasonings and mix well. 
Rinse a flat dish with cold water and on it spread the semolina 
to a thickness of half an inch. Leave for an hour, and when 
cold, cut with a knife rinsed under the tap, into squares or 
diamonds 1 J inches or 2 inches across. 



[ 72 ]. 



GNOCCHI ALLA ROMANA 

Having prepared your gnocchi in accordance with the foregoing 
instructions, butter a fireproof dish and in it lay a layer of 
gnocchij sprinkling with grated Parmesan and dotting with 
buter. Add a second and a third layer, with Parmesan and dots 
of butter between each, and to make dish attractive pile your 
layers in pyramid form. When the last of the gnocchi are used 
up, sprinkle with more Parmesan and over the whole pour 
1 J ounces melted butter. Place dish in moderate oven for twenty 
minutes or until the gnocchi have taken on a golden colour. 
Serve in the dish in which they were cooked. 



GNOCCHI WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

As an alternative to the above dish, make your gnocchi about 
one quarter the size, and serve hot with tomato sauce just 
sufficient to surround each dumpling with sauce but not to have 
the dish 'swimming' in sauce. With these, hand a bowl of grated 
Parmesan cheese. 



[ 73 ] 



Rice 



Although pasta, either pasta asciutta (pasta eaten with 
some form of sauce) or pasta in brodo (pasta in soup) 
appears with fair regularity in the Italian daily diet all 
over the peninsula, there is, in the north, a tendency to vary 
this by the use of rice dishes. Rice is cultivated in northern 
Italy on a heavy scale, and that grown in the Piedmont area, 
that is to say the stretch of country lying between the Bay 
of Genoa on the South and the Grain Alps of Switzerland on 
the North, produces a particularly fine, hard grain, equal in 
quality to the best that Patna in India can offer, and ideally 
suited to the long, slow cooking that is a feature of Italian rice 
dishes. 

It is as well to remember to ask for Piedmont rice, or failing 
this to specify Patjna rice, as the shorter, rounder grained rice, 
known to my local grocer as 'pudding rice', though excellent 
for that good old English standby, rice pudding, is apt to pro- 
duce a somewhat sticky risotto. If, when shopping at a small 
local shop you are asked, as I have been asked: 'Do you want 
the pudding rice or THE OTHER KIND?' it's fairly safe to 
plump for THE OTHER KIND. 

If you have never previously tried to cook a Risotto, the 
instructions may come as a slight bombshell, but I promise you, 
if you will follow them faithfully, the result will surpass anything 
you might achieve if you were to give in to the temptation to 
'par-boil the rice first of all', to mention but one of the many 
incorrect methods. To all such suggestions I cannot too emphat- 
ically say 'DON'T'. 

Supposing you are about to produce a risotto for four people, 
start operations a good three-quarters of an hour before the 
meal is scheduled — and just supposing you happen to be a work- 
ing housewife, let me assure you that, heretical though the 
suggestion may appear to be, an excellent risotto can be pre- 
pared in the morning before you leave for the day's work, and 
re-heated so as to produce a really good dish for dinner the 
same evening — moreover, the flavour is apt to be all the richer 
if the various ingredients have had all day in which to insinuate 
their many and varied flavours into the finished dish. The one 
ingredient I prefer not to allow to remain all day in the risotto is 

[ 74 ] 



the portion of chopped mushrooms, which, to my way of think- 
ing, are much better sauteed in butter or oil and added to the 
dish not more than twenty minutes before serving time. 

One thing to remember where the use of rice in Italy is 
concerned is that except in the case of the famous Osso Buchi, 
rice is not served with meats but whatever meat is used is mixed 
with the rice to form one integrated dish. 

And now to your first risotto for four people. 




[ 75 ] 



PLAIN RISOTTO 

TO SERVE 4 

12 to 15 tablespoons 2 medium sized on- 
Piedmont or Patna ions chopped small 
rice, the quantity 1^ pints or there- 
depending on the abouts of stock, 
appetites of the chicken for prefer- 
consumers ence, and if you 

2 tablespoons best want a touch of 

olive oil, or a luxury, substitute 

mixture of oil and a wineglassful of 

butter or, if you white wine for an 

want it in the equal quantity of 

truly Milanese stock 

style, 2 ozs. of saffron for colouring 
butter 

Heat the oil or butter in a heavy pan, add the onion, chopped 
small, and allow to cook until it is a golden yellow but NOT 
brown. Add the rice DRY, and cook slowly together for a few min- 
utes, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the grains are almost 
transparent. Now begin adding your stock — and now is a good 
moment to insert an asbestos mat between the pan and the 
direct heat of the stove. The stock is added in very small quanti- 
ties a few tablespoonfuls at a time, and the Risotto is stirred 
frequently to prevent sticking. When the first instalment of the 
stock is absorbed, add the next and so on until the rice has fin- 
ished cooking, and most if not all of the stock has been used. 
This should take from twenty-five to thirty minutes. Test the 
rice for tenderness towards the end of this time, and when it is 
tender and the dish looks creamy but is not sticky, the risotto is 
ready for the table. The grains, though tender, should still be 
separate. 

To give your risotto a truly Milanese appearance it should be 
coloured a primrose yellow (rather than a buttercup yellow) 
with saffron at the end of the cooking time. If you are using the 
filaments — the dried stamens of the autumn crocus — take 
two or three of these, and having pounded them to a powder 
and allowed them to steep five minutes or so in a little warmed 



[ 76 ] 



stock, strain and add them to the rice. You may, however, have 
purchased a thimbleful of already powdered saffron from an 
Italian provision shop, in which case add it, small pinch by 
small pinch, until the desired colour is obtained, but be careful 
not to overdo the pinches, as a little goes a long way. 

This dish, omitting the white wine, is excellent with nothing 
added but a generous lump of butter and a few tablespoons of 
grated Parmesan, stirred in, allowed to melt and served imme- 
diately, before it has a chance to go stringy. With it hand more 
grated Parmesan to be added at will, and more butter, and you 
have a truly classic Risotto alia Milanese. 



PLAIN RISOTTO 
A somewhat richer version 

Proceed as before, but with the addition of white wine, and if 
you can procure about an ounce of marrow from marrow bones, 
you will have a really rich dish. 

You may also substitute for the white wine a glass of Marsala, 
but in this case. I would advise against the marrow, as that and 
the Marsala combined would make the dish over-rich for most 
palates. 

Now for the variations of this simple and typically Italian 
dish: 



MUSHROOMRISOTTO 

TO SERVE 2 

1 rasher streaky 6 medium sized 
bacon tomatoes 

2 ozs. butter f pint stock 

2 medium sized pepper, salt, nutmeg 

onions 4 to 6 ozs. cold, lean 

6 ozs. rice meat 

f lb. mushrooms 1 tablespoonful sul- 

tanas 



[ 77 ] 



Cut the bacon small and fry lightly in the butter, remove from 
pan, and add to the pan the chopped onions, frying them for 
two or three minutes. Add the rice and cook gently until it is 
transparent — about 5 minutes — add all the mushrooms 
except about two tablespoons of chopped mushrooms which 
will be useful for garnishing; add sliced and peeled tomatoes 
and replace bacon in pan. Add the stock in small instalments, 
giving the risotto a stir from time to time to prevent the rice 
sticking to the bottom of the pan. Ten minutes before serving, 
add the cold meat chopped small, and the sultanas, together 
with the remainder of the mushrooms which have been cut 
in small pieces and sauteed in a little butter. The rice should 
be cooked in about half an hour from the time it was added to 
the dish. 

Serve, together with grated Parmesan to be added if liked. 



MY OWN FAVOURITE RISOTTO 

TO SERVE 4 

12 tablespoons 1 cupful of cooked 
Piedmont rice (or frozen) green 

4 ozs. butter peas 

2 medium sized on- a few cooked 

ions chopped small French beans, if 

IJ pints stock available 

J lb. mushrooms 1 or 2 tomatoes, 

chopped fine peeled and cut 

^ lb. lean ham or small 

gammon, cut into pepper and salt 

small pieces a pinch of thyme 

a pinch of nutmeg 

Proceed as for plain risotto, but half-way through the cooking 
time add the mushrooms, which have been sauteed in butter, 
the ham, peas, beans and tomatoes, and the seasonings. 

When serving, hand a bowl of freshly grated Parmesan, to be 
added at will. 



[ 78 ] 



RISOTTO WITH BRAINS 

TO SERVE 4 

f lb. lean veal saffron to colour 

a little beef marrow, 1 calf's brain 

if available 1 medium sized 
12 tablespoons onion 

Piedmont rice 1 tablespoonful 
4 ozs. butter parsley 

1 J pints stock pepper and salt to 
4 tablespoons grated taste 

Parmesan 

Wash the brains in salt and water, remove the skin and fibres 
and let them remain in salt and water till ready to use. 

Heat butter in a heavy pan, add chopped onion and allow 
to cook a few minutes until the onion is golden yellow, add the 
chopped parsley, chopped veal and marrow if available, and 
allow to brown for 8 to 10 minutes; add the rice and the stock 
little by little. Drain the brains and cut into small pieces, and 
when the dish has been cooking for quarter of an hour or twenty 
minutes add these to the risotto and continue cooking until the 
rice is tender. Just before serving, add the seasonings and the 
grated Parmesan. 



RISOTTO WITH SHELLFISH 

TO SERVE 4 

Make a perfectly plain risotto, but instead of stock made from 
meat or chicken, use fish stock if available, or failing this, plain 
water plus a wine-glassful of white wine. 

Meanwhile, allowing five or six scampi or Dublin Bay 
prawns, or the equivalent quantity of lobster or peeled shrimps 
per person, sautee the shelled and cut up fish in a little butter to 
which a little crushed garlic has been added. Towards the end 
of the cooking of the risotto add the fish, together with the butter 
in which it has been cooked. Finally stir in butter and grated 
Parmesan.

CHICKEN RISOTTO 

TO SERVE 4 

If you have some left-over boiled chicken, remove any skin, 
and cut the meat into small pieces. You should have at least 
two breakfast cupfuls. In addition you will need: 

1 medium sized 2 peeled tomatoes 

onion 1 small carrot 

1 clove garlic, 1 stalk celery 

crushed 2 tablespoons or 

J lb. mushrooms thereabouts of 

J pint chicken stock; chopped lean 

and later, when ham or gammom

more wine 

1 oz. butter pepper and salt 

chopped parsley 12 ozs. rice 

Heat the butter and in it saut^e the chopped onion, garlic, 
celery and chopped carrot; after five minutes add the chopped 
mushrooms, and the tomatoes cut small ; allow to cook together 
for a couple of minutes, then stir in the chopped chicken and the 
wine and increase the heat so that the dish cooks fast for a couple 
of minutes more ; add the seasonings ; stir in the stock, cover the 
pan and allow to cook slowly for half an hour or so before 
adding the rice — 12 ozs. — and proceeding as for an 
ordinary risotto, using chicken stock or water for further mois- 
tening 'during the cooking of the rice. 

Finally stir in grated Parmesan and a generous portion of 
butter. 



RISOTTO GENOVESE 

Rice in the Genoese style 

TO SERVE 4 

For this dish the rice is first of all par-boiled. Cook 12 ozs. 
of rice in boiling, salted water in a large pan as previously 
directed, but remove and drain a few minutes before it is 
completely cooked, and when drained, turn it into a clean 



[ 80 ]. 



saucepan, and to it add the following sauce, plus a generous 
lump of butter, cooking together and stirring to avoid sticking, 
for five minutes or until the rice has finished cooking. 

When serving, hand with the dish a bowlful of freshly grated 
Parmesan cheese. 

SAUCE 



J lb. raw lean meat, 
beef or veal for 
preference 

2 or 3 stalks of cele- 
ry, washed and 
cut fine 

pepper and salt to 
taste 

butter for sauteeing 
the vegetables and 
meat 



2 or 3 carrots, washed 

and diced 
1 medium onion, 

chopped 
chopped parsley 
a pinch of oregano or 

thyme 
J pint of white 

wine 



Heat the butter, and in it sautee the vegetables until they are 
a golden colour; add the meat and allow to brown, stirring so 
as to prevent sticking. Add the wine, and cook fairly rapidly 
until the liquid has diminished by half, then cover and simmer 
for an hour, by which time the sauce should have the consistency 
of syrup. 



RICE AND PEAS AS SERVED 

IN VENICE 
'Risi e bisV 

TO SERVE 6 



3 lbs. peas weighed 
before shelHng 

1 lb. rice 

2 J to 3 pints hot 

meat stock 
1 tablespoon olive oil 



1 tablespoon butter 

1 tablespoon lard 

2 tablespoons finely 
chopped parsley 

2 spring onions 



Shell and wash peas. Heat oil, butter and lard in heavy pan, 
add finely chopped onions and parsley and cook gently. Add 



[ 81 1 



peas and allow to cook long enough to absorb fat. Then add just 
enough hot meat stock to cover and allow to bubble before 
adding rice, having done which, add a further | pint heated 
stock and cook gently without stirring for 25 or 30 minutes 
until rice is cooked. At end of cooking stir in a further tablespoon- 
ful of butter and 2 tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan, and when 
serving, hand a dish of grated Parmesan so that more may be 
added if wished. This dish should not be allowed to become too 
dry in the cooking. 



RICE WITH TURNIPS 

Riso e rape 

TO SERVE 6 

12 ozs. peeled 2 J to 3 pints meat 

turnips stock 

1 lb. rice salt and pepper to 

\ cupful tomato taste 

sauce (See ^SAUCES') 

Gut the turnips in slices, spread on a plate, sprinkle with salt, 
cover with another plate and allow to stand for two hours, so as 
to draw off the surplus water from the vegetable. At the end of 
this time, drain the turnips, and place in a heavy pan in which 
you have heated the butter; allow to brown a little, stirring 
with a wooden spoon so that they do not stick to the bottom 
of the pan ; stir in the tomato sauce and allow to cook for four 
or five minutes, then cover with heated stock, bring to the boil 
and add the rice. Cook gently for quarter of an hour or twenty 
minutes, adding more stock if the dish begins to appear dry. 
Do not overcook, or the flavour is diminished. 



[ 82 ] 



RICE WITH CABBAGE 

Riso e cavoli 

TO SERVE 6 



Sufficient good hard 
cabbage to weigh 
I lb. when the 
outside leaves and 
hard centre stalk 
have been re- 
moved 



1 lb. rice 

2\ to 3 pints stock, 

chicken stock for 

preference 
salt and pepper to 

taste 



Having removed the outer leaves and centre stalk of the cabbage, 
wash carefully, strain, and cut finely. Bring stock to the boil, add 
the cabbage, let it cook gently for five minutes, then add the 
rice and cook gently for a further fifteen or twenty minutes, or 
until the rice is 'al dente'. To give a richer flavour to this, try 
the addition of two or three slices of lean ham, finely chopped, 
and a little tomato paste 'broken down' with a few tablespoons- 
ful of the hot broth. 



RICE WITH CELERY 

Riso e sedano 

An agreeable dish is obtained by substituting for cabbage in 
the foregoing recipe a good head of celery, washed and chopped 
finely. 



TO BOIL RICE 

Now for a few comments on plain boiled rice. 

You will need a large saucepan, with plenty of boiling water, 
and one or one-and-a-half tablespoons of rice per person. The 
saucepan must be large enough for the rice to move about freely 
[while it is cooking, which allows surplus starch to escape into 
the boiling water, which is something it cannot do under crowd- 
ed conditions. 

Some cooks prefer to wash the rice before cooking, but actual- 
ly, so long as it is looked over and any remaining husks removed, 
washing is not necessary as any dust there may be in the rice 

[ 83 ] 



will rise to the top during the cooking and is easily skimmed off. 
However, if you are going to feel better about washed rice, by 
all means wash it. 

When the water is boiling rapidly and salt has been added, 
add the rice and allow it to boil fast from fifteen to twenty 
minutes, depending on the quality of the rice and on personal 
taste. Towards the end of fifteen minutes test a few grains by 
biting, and when they are soft, and before they have had a chance 
to become 'mushy', remove the saucepan from the stove, and 
strain the rice through a fairly fine colander. Run cold water 
through the colander, shaking the rice as you do so to remove 
any starch still adhering, and then place the rice in a lidless, 
heated fireproof dish in a warm — NOT HOT — oven with 
the oven door left open, for a few minutes to dry. Alternatively, 
the drying can be achieved by placing the dish over a saucepan 
of boiling water on top of the stove for a minute or two. 



BOILED RICE WITH BUTTER 
AND CHEESE 

Riso in cagnoni 

Allow a quarter of a pound of rice per person. Cook the rice as 
directed for Plain Boiled Rice, and when it has finished cooking 
and has been strained, place in a heated casserole, and add 
generous portions of butter and grated Parmesan, mixing well 
before serving. 

As a variation, you may, if you wish, heat the butter first 
until it has become a golden liquid, and you may also, if you 
wish, flavour it with a little finely chopped garlic. 

A simple dish by no means to be despised. 



[ 84 ] 



A RICHER WAY OF SERVING 
BOILED RICE 

Risotto in cagnoni di magro 

TO SERVE 4 

Cook 1 lb. of rice in the approved fashion and when it has 
been cooked and drained, stir into it the following sauce: 

1 onion chopped 1 tablespoonful 

fine chopped parsley 

6 anchovies \ cupful tomato 

4 tablespoonfuls oil sauce 

Cook onion till yellow in the heated oil, stir in the parsley, and 
the anchovies, boned and cut into small pieces; cook together 
for five minutes, stir in tomato sauce, bring to boil and mix 
with the rice. 



CHEESE RICE BALLS . 

TO SERVE 4 i 

2 cupfuls left-over 2 or three slices of 

plain boiled rice lean ham, cut < 

2 eggs into strips i 

4 ozs. Mozzarella oil for frying | 

or Bel Paese cheese 1 further egg i 

breadcrumbs : 

Mix together the rice and beaten eggs, and form into balls. - 

Flatten each ball on the palm of your hand, and on the flattened ■ 

surface lay a strip of ham and a strip of cheese. Close the ball ' 

together again, so that the rice conceals the contents. Continue i 

till all the rice is used. ^ 

Finally dip the balls ('Suppli' if you want the Italian name) j 

in ^gg breadcrumbs, and fry them in hot olive oil until they are ^ 
a golden brown. Drain before serving. 



[ 85 ] 



ARANGINI 

TO SERVE 4 

Often when a train has stopped at a small station in Italy or 
Sicily, the attendant wheeling the 'Tavola Calda', the trolley 
containing hot food to be consumed on the train, makes his 
way down the platform to the accompaniment of the cry ' Aran- 
g-e-e-e-e-e-ni', and the hardy traveller who takes a chance 
on this typically Italian tit-bit is handed a piece of brown paper, 
containing a warm mound of rice, the colour of a pale orange, 
the best way of eating which is out of the paper, using the paper 
later as a napkin to wipe mouth and hands. 

To make 8 of these 'delicacies', you will need the following 
ingredients : 

1 lb. rice f lb. lean minced 

4 tablespoons grated beef 

Parmesan 2 tablespoons 

1 beaten egg chopped parsley 

1 tablespoon olive 2 hard boiled eggs 

oil (a refinement, this 

black pepper addition) 

a pinch of salt breadcrumbs and 

oil for deep frying 

Cook the rice in boiling, salted water, drain and mix with half 
the beaten egg. Heat the olive oil in a heavy pan, brown the 
minced meat in this, remove from the heat and mix with grated 
cheese, parsley and — if used — chopped hard boiled eggs. 

Rinse the hands in cold water, take a handful of cooked rice, 
and in the centre of this place a generous portion of the fore- 
going mixture, closing the rice up to encase the mixture and 
form a ball. Repeat this until all the rice and all the filling is 
used up. Dip the balls in the balance of the beaten egg, coat 
with fine breadcrumbs and fry in deep, hot oil until they have 
taken on a light golden-brown colour. 

A few left-over cooked spring peas are a welcome addition to 
the other ingredients. 

The above recipe makes a delicious dish for home consump- 
tion, that is good eaten with hot tomato sauce, using any of the 
recipes under the heading 'SAUCES'. The railway station 
variety is rather less luxurious, and the hard boiled eggs are 
usually conspicuous by their absence, but nevertheless, it is tasty 
and filling on a long journey when there is no restaurant car on 
the train.

SARTU 

Rice does not appear on the Neapolitan menu nearly as fre- 
quently as do the various types of pasta, but there is one rice dish 
that is a specialty of Naples, and that, in spite of the length 
of time required for its preparation, is well worth trying, parti- 
cularly at a time when you have available some turkey or 
chicken giblets — why not serve such a dish on Boxing Day, as 
a change from the cold left-overs from the Christmas turkey? 
The list of ingredients, though formidable, is not necessarily 
difficult to cope with. For six people you will need the following: 



12 ozs. of rice 
J lb. lean beef 

passed through 

the mincer 
1 egg plus 1 egg 

yolk 

1 clove garlic, 
crushed 

pepper and salt 
chopped parsley 

2 one-inch slices 

of bread with the 

crusts removed 
flour 
oil or lard for 

frying 
about a cupful of 

cooked green peas 
Jib. Bel Paese cheese 



J lb. fresh 

mushrooms cut in 
small pieces or 

J oz . of dried 
mushrooms, 
reconstituted by 
soaking them in 
warm water for 
a few minutes 

turkey or chicken 
giblets, a small 
chopped onion, 
a little chopped 
carrot 

J lb. Italian sausage 

meat sauce with 
tomatoes (see 
'SAUCES' 

about 5 tablespoons 
grated Parmesan 

crisp breadcrumbs 



First of all, combine your minced lean beef, the bread — soaked 
in a little milk and squeezed dry — the garlic and chopped 
parsley with the beaten egg and egg yolk, together with the 
seasonings. Form into small balls or rissoles, and fry in hot 
oil until they are brown on both sides. Meanwhile, boil your 
rice in the approved fashion, in boiling, salted water and drain 
well. Cook the giblets with the exception of the liver, in a little 
water, with the chopped carrot and onion, for at least two 
hours, adding a bay leaf if the flavour is liked. Ten or fifteen 
minutes before the end of this time, add the liver and the sliced 



[ 87 ] 



mushrooms. You are now ready to start composing your 
sartu. Butter a fireproof souffle dish that is large enough to hold 
the combined ingredients, and after buttering it, sprinkle crisp 
breadcrumbs over the bottom and sides. Arrange about three- 
quarters of the boiled rice in a layer covering the bottom and 
the sides of the souffle dish, and in this casing place the meat 
balls, the giblets cut into pieces, the mushrooms, peas and the 
sausages cut in pieces. Over this pour the gravy from the giblets 
and sufficient meat and tomato sauce to moisten. Cut the cheese 
in small pieces and arrange on top, and finally cover with 
the balance of the boiled rice, and pour over a little more 
of the meat and tomato sauce, so that the dish is moist but not 
'mushy'. Sprinkle with a fairly heavy layer of crisp bread, 
crumbs and the grated Parmesan cheese. Bake in a moderate 
oven for half an hour. The ingredients suggested are, so to 
speak, the bare minimum, you may add to the glory and mystery 
of your sart^ by varying the ingredients with a little chopped 
ham or breast of turkey or chicken cut small, and if you wish 
to be particularly luxurious, hard boil a couple of eggs, cut 
them in four lengthways and arrange them on the top of the 
dish before adding the final layer of rice. 



FRIED RICE 

TO SERVE 4 

1 cupful left-over 1 chopped onion 

boiled rice salt and pepper to 

4 eggs scrambled taste 

4 rashers streaky 
bacon 

Cut bacon into inch-long pieces, and fry; chop onion, add to 
bacon and fry until it is golden ; stir in the rice and fry till light 
brown,' and at last minute stir in the scrambled eggs, and mix 
well.

RICE SOUFFLfi WITH 
CHICKEN LIVERS 

TO SERVE 6 

J lb. rice 2 pints chicken 

J lb. butter stock 

^ lb. chicken livers a wineglassful of 

4 eggs Marsala 

2 tablespoonsful 
grated Parmesan 

Cook the rice for twenty minutes in the chicken stock, and at 
the end of that time stir in the cheese, butter and the chicken 
livers which have been cut in strips, floured lightly and fried 
in a little butter and the Marsala. Allow the mixture to cool, 
and then stir in the beaten yolks of the eggs and mix well. 
Beat the egg whites stiff, and fold into the mixture. Grease 
a souffle dish that is large enough to hold the whole mixture, 
line it with buttered paper, and pour in your souffle mixture, 
and cook in a moderate oven for about quarter of an hour. 



RICE SOUFFLfi WITH 
SHRIMPS 

TO SERVE 6 

Proceed as for the foregoing recipe, but substituting for the 
chicken broth either water in which fish has been boiled, or 
failing that, plain water; and for the chicken livers, half a pound 
of shelled shrimps or prawns. 



[ 89 ]• 



Polenta 



One more of the farinaceous foods beloved by Italians is 
the yellow maize flour, known as polenta, which can be 
obtained in Italian provision shops in this country. It 
can be bought either finely or coarsely ground, depending on 
the taste of the consumer. 

It appears frequently on the tables of the north of Italy, 
frequently being used in lieu of bread, and although the plain 
boiled polenta is stodgy and uninteresting, if it is allowed to cool, 
it can be cut into slices, or formed into small dumplings, 
something after the style of gnocchi, and can form the basis 
of a good many agreeable dishes. 

To cook sufficient polenta for four people, start off with six 
to eight ounces of the finely ground variety. Bring a pint of 
water to the boil in a fairly large saucepan, and to this add the 
polenta and cook slowly for about twenty minutes, stirring all 
the time. At the end of this time it should be thick and smooth. 

Spread it on a large plate that has been rinsed with cold 
water, allow to cool, and then either cut it into slices, or with 
floured hands form it into little dumplings the size of a small 

The following are one or two ways in which the cooked 
product may be used. 



[ 90 ] 



BATUFFOLI AL SUGO 

TO SERVE 4 

Prepare half a pound of finely ground polenta as directed, 
and when cool form into little dumplings. Butter a fireproof 
dish, and in it lay a layer of these dumplings. When the first 
layer is completed, cover with a meat sauce and sprinkle 
generously with grated Parmesan, and on top place a second 
layer, continuing the layers until the dumplings are all used. 
Sprinkle little dabs of butter on the top layer, and a generous 
sprinkling of grated Parmesa.n ; place in a hot oven for a few 
moments to allow the cheese to melt and serve very hot. 



POLENTA AND CHEESE 

TO SERVE 4 PEOPLE 

Cook half a pound of Polenta as previously directed, spreading 
on a moistened dish or a marble slab to cool. Cut into slabs 
and lay these in a buttered fireproof dish, sprinkling generous 
helpings of grated Parmesan between the layers, and seasoning 
with salt and a little cayenne. Cover top layer grated cheese 
and a little butter, and bake in a hot oven until brown. Serve 
very hot. 



POLENTA WITH TOMATO 
SAUCE 

TO SERVE 4 

J pint hot water 8 tablespoons 

i pint milk grated Parmesan 

J lb. finely ground oil for frying 

polenta 1 egg 

pepper and salt fine breadcrumbs 

to taste 

Cook the polenta for half an hour in a double boiler in the hot 
water and milk which have been mixed and brought to the 
boil. At the last minute stir in cheese and seasonings, and stir 
until thoroughly mixed. Spread on a moistened dish to cool. 



[ 91 ] 



Beat the egg and when the polenta is cold, cut into slices, 
dip in egg and breadcrumbs and fry in hot olive oil until 
brown. Serve hot with Tomato Sauce (See 'SAUCES'). 

If you don't object to the slight stodginess, you may eat your 
polenta as it comes out of the saucepan, hot, without first 
waiting for it to cool, with any of the meat or tomato sauces 
under the heading of 'SAUCES', or just with butter and cheese, 
but for the average English palate, the cooled and fried or 
baked variety is preferable. 

There is a delicious sausage dish made with polenta that 
rather puts the 'Sausage Toad' of English war-time memories 
in the shade. For it you need half a pound of polenta cooked 
as directed in boiling, salted water; unsweetened tomato sauce 
(See 'SAUCES'), and a pound of Italian sausages, or failing 
these, chipolata. 

Cut the sausages into 1 inch lengths, and fry until they are 
brown, then pour over them the Tomato Sauce and mix well 
together. 

When the polenta is cooked, spread one half of it in a buttered 
fireproof dish, and over this pour one half of the sauce; add 
a second layer of polenta and the balance of the sauce. Sprinkle 
with grated Parmesan and place in a hot oven for a few mo- 
ments so that the cheese melts and browns a trifle. Serve very 
hot. 



CECI 

Chick peas 

These small, hard yellow dried peas simply MUST be soaked 
overnight, and after soaking they need long, slow cooking in 
salted water to which the addition of a half teaspoon of bicar- 
bonate of soda to each quart of water helps in the tenderising 
process. Cooked in this way until tender, and cooled, they make 
a good addition to salad, seasoned with oil and vinegar or 
lemon juice. 



[ 92 ] 



CECI ALLA MARINARA 

Chick peas, sailors^ style 

TO SERVE 4 



1 lb. chick peas, 
prepared as 
suggested in the 
foregoing para- 
graph 

pepper 



2 or 3 tablespoons 

oil 
4 anchovies 
1 tablespoon 

chopped parsley 



Having cooked the soaked peas till tender, allow them to 
keep hot in the water in which they have been cooked. Mean- 
while, heat the oil, and to it add the anchovies cut small, the 
parsley and pepper to taste; mix well. Drain the 'ceci', and over 
them pour the prepared sauce, mixing well before serving.

Omelettes, 
Egg & Cheese Dishes 



If you are a lover of the light, fluffy omelette produced by the | 

deft hands of the English or French omelette maker, you had \ 

better not order an omelette in Italy, for it is a heavier affair, 'f 

it will be cooked in oil, and its filling, if it is a filled omelette, si 

will be over-generous. If, however, you like your omelettes | 

solid and substantial, you will be on safe ground. j 

Here is a typical Italian recipe for an omelette, which can be I 

made *asciutta' or 'morbida', that is to say, dry, or not so dry, ] 

and of the two, the latter more nearly resembles the omelette i 

of France or England. \ 



--[ 94 ] 



FRITTATA SEMPLICE 

Plain Omelette 

TO SERVE 3 

Break six eggs into a basin, and beat them until well mixed 
but not frothy, adding a pinch of salt. Meanwhile in a heavy 
frying pan, preferably one kept only for the making of omelettes, 
heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and cook over moderate heat, 
lifting the edges from time to time with a spatula so that the 
uncooked portion can reach the bottom of the pan and become 
cooked. Continue until there is no liquid remaining. Then, if 
you are an expert pancake tosser, and only then, toss the ome- 
lette so as to reverse it. If you are not so skilled, turn it with 
a metal slice and allow the other side to cook. Turn on to 
a heated dish and serve very hot. 

So much for the FRITTATA ASGIUTTA, the dry ome- 
lette. If you prefer the more digestible FRITTATA MOR- 
BIDA, cook the omelette on the one side, lifting the edges so 
that the liquid portion may reach the bottom of the pan and 
become cooked; form it with the spatula into an oval shape, 
and without turning, slip it on to a heated oval dish and serve 
immediately. 



OMELETTE WITH HERBS 

Using the same basic recipe and procedure, try your omelette 
with the addition of a little chopped parsley, a little chopped 
basil or thyme, or a combination of several chopped herbs, 
and as an experiment, try the addition of a very little chopped 
rosemary. 



FRITTATA AL TARTUFI 

Again starting with the basic omelette recipe, before turning 
it into the frying pan, add a finely chopped black or white 
truffle. 



[ 95 ] 



FRITTATA AL FUNGHI 

Omelette with mushrooms 

While you are preparing the eggs, saut6 a quarter of a pound 
of mushrooms cut in small pieces in a little butter and add to 
the omelette as it is beginning to cook, with a spatula fold the 
cooked portion over the mushrooms so that by the time the 
dish is completely cooked the filling is enveloped in the egg 
mixture, slide on to a heated oval platter and serve very hot. 



FRITTATA ALLA SALSA DI 
POMIDORO 

Omelette with tomato sauce 

Before cooking, add two tablespoons of tomato sauce (See 
'SAUCES') to the egg mixture. 



FRITTATA AL FORMAGGIO 

Cheese Omelette 

To the basic tgg mixture add an ounce of grated Parmesan 
cheese before starting the cooking process. 



FRITTATA AL LEGUMI 

Vegetable Omelette 

If you have a cupful of cooked young green peas, or a similar 
amount of cooked asparagus tips, add these to the omelette 
as it is beginning to cook and proceed as suggested for FRIT- 
TATA AL FUNGHI. 



--[ 96 ] 



FRITTATA AL PROSCIUTTO 

Ham Omelette 

Cut two or three thin slices of ham into small pieces, and add 
to the eggs before starting to cook; proceed as suggested for 
FRITTATA SEMPLICE. If liked, a little ItaHan salami may 
be substituted for the ham. 



FRITTATA ALLA CIPOLLE 

Onion Omelette 

Chop a medium sized onion into small pieces and brown 
in a little butter; when cooked add to the basic egg mixture 
before starting to cook the omelette. 



FRITTATA FARCITA 

Stuffed omelette 

Heat a little butter in a separate frying pan and in it combine 
f lb. mushrooms cut in small pieces, a tablespoon finely 
chopped fresh parsley, salt and pepper to taste and a tablespoon 
of cream. Allow to cook together for five minutes. Meanwhile 
make an omelette as suggested for FRITTATA SEMPLICE, 
and when the underside is lightly cooked, pour on the sauce, 
and continue cooking, wrapping the &gg mixture gradually 
around the filling. Serve very hot. 



FRITTATA AL CARCIOFI 

Artichoke omelette 

For this the small globe artichokes which can be purchased 
preserved are used. The fresh vegetables are, of course, prefer- 
able, but are not always easy to obtain in this country. Take 
half a dozen of the artichokes, drain well, cut in pieces and fry 

[ 97 ] 



lightly in a little butter, meanwhile preparing your FRITTATA 
SEMPLICE, and adding the artichokes as suggested for the 
sauce in FRITTATA FARCITA, just as the underside of 
the omelette is cooked, and wrapping the egg gradually around 
the artichokes so that by the time the omelette finishes cooking 
they are encajsed in it. 

Now for a couple of really 'solid' omelettes. 



FRITTATA DI PATATE 

Potato omelette 

TO SERVE 4 

Boil four medium sized potatoes in salted water, and when 
cooked, drain and mash well, or pass through a ricer. Mix 
with the lightly beaten yolks of four eggs, and a tablespoonful 
of chopped parsley, and, if liked, a pinch of cinnamon ; finally 
stir in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, and fry, first on one 
side and then on the other, in hot butter. Serve hot. 



FRITTATA COL RISO 

Rice omelette 

TO SERVE 4 

1 pint milk 3 oz. rice 

4 eggs 2 oz. grated 

1 oz. butter Parmesan 

salt to taste a pinch of 

cinnamon 

Heat the milk and rice in a double boiler and allow to cook 
gently until the rice is tender and the milk absorbed (about 
1 hour or a Httle longer). Stir in the butter, grated cheese, 
cinnamon and salt, and when it has cooled somewhat, add the 
eggs, beaten lightly. Mix well, and fry in hot butter, first on 
one side and then on the other, or if preferred, bake in a buttered 
souffl6 dish in a moderate oven till browned. 
Solid, but satisfying, this one. 

[ 98 1 ' 



UOVE STRACCIATE 
AL FORMAGGIO 

Scrambled eggs with cheese 

TO SERVE 4 

6 eggs 2 ozs. butter 

1 J to 2 ozs. A little cream if 

grated Parmesan available 

Beat the eggs lightly, adding a tablespoonful of cream if avail- 
able. Meanwhile warm the butter in a small stewpan, pour in 
the tgg mixture, and cook over moderate heat, stirring con- 
tinually, until the eggs are scrambled; at the last moment stir 
in the grated cheese and serve immediately on buttered toast. 



UOVA COL RISO 

Eggs with rice 

TO SERVE 4 

If you have a teacupful of cold boiled rice, this is a good way 
of using it up. 

Allow two eggs per person, place them in boiling water and 
allow them to cook for not longer than five minutes, and as 
soon as they are sufficiently cool to handle, shell them. Mean- 
while, prepare eight small ramekin dishes by greasing fairly 
liberally with butter, and placing a little rice in the bottom 
of each; place a shelled egg on top of the rice, and cover with a 
teaspoonful of grated Parmesan and dot with butter. They can 
then be 'poached', by placing the dishes in a shallow pan 
with hot water halfway up the sides of the dishes, and cooking 
over moderate heat for about five minutes or until the cheese 
melts, or alternatively they may be baked in the oven for a 
similar length of time.

FRIED CHEESE 

For each person allow two slices of Bel Paese about the size 
of half a slice of bread and cut very thin. Flour lightly, and dip 
first in beaten egg and then in breadcrumbs and fry golden 
brown, first on one side then on the other in hot butter, drain- 
ing them after cooking so as to remove surplus fat. SERVE 
VERY HOT.

Fish 



Have you ever stopped to consider the lack of imagination 
shown by the average — and I mean the average, not 
the exceptional — English housewife where the cooking 
and serving of fish are concerned? Yet look at our coastline, 
look at the variety of fish obtainable at most fishmongers' 
shops, and you'll probably agree that there's no real reason 
for our slavish adherence to . . . 



Boiled cod . . . 

Soused Herrings — delicious though they undoubtedly 
are . . . 

Fish'n chips . . . 

With crab or lobster, or a few shrimps or prawns for 
a special treat. 

There's really no reason on earth why Friday, Fish Day, 
should not produce the tastiest and most exciting meals of the 
week. Take a look and see what our friends, the Italians, do 
about fish. To be sure, fish such as octopus and squid are not 
easily come by over here, and many of us wouldn't fancy 
eating them if they were, and for scampi we may have to make do 
with Dublin Bay prawns, but remembering the galaxy of fish 
now at our disposal, we can enlarge our repertoire of dishes 
very considerably. The following few recipes are offered in the 
hope that they will encourage experiments. 



[ 101 \ 



FISH FRIED 
IN THE SICILIAN WAY 

Fry this now and again as an alternative to our own more 
conservative methods of cooking. 

First prepare your fish by cleaning, washing and wiping 
dry, and finally dipping in flour. 

Then in a heavy pan heat a good layer of good quality olive 
oil; when it is really hot, sprinkle generously with salt and when 
it is smoking put in your prepared fish, brown quickly on both 
sides, cover the pan, and lower the heat until the fish is cooked 
through. Serve very hot. 



FISH AU GRATIN 

Pesce gratinato 



TO SERVE 6 

6 ozs. rice J lb. butter 

1 lb. floury potatoes f lb. previously 

2 tablespoonsful boiled fish, from 
flour which skin and 

J pint milk bones have been 

2 tablespoons removed 

grated Parmesan breadcrumbs 

Cook the rice as directed for 'BOILED RICE'; when cooked 
and drained, replace in saucepan, and mix with beaten ^gg 
yolk and 6 ozs. of butter, and allow to keep warm until the butter 
is absorbed. Meanwhile cook and mash the potatoes with 
a little butter. 
'Prepare a Bechamel sauce of 2 ozs. butter, 2 tablespoons 
flour and a quarter of a pint or slightly more of hot milk. 

Flake the fish finely. 

Having made these preparations, butter a fireproof dish 
and in it place the rice, forming a flat 'bed' on which to place 
the flaked fish. Form a border with the mashed potato; pour 
the Bechamel over the fish, and add a layer of Parmesan, 
grated and mixed with crisp breadcrumbs. Cook in a hot 
oven until the Parmesan has melted and the Bechamel has 
taken on a golden colour. 

f 102 ] : 



FISH CAKES 

TO SER\^ 4 

about a cupful 1 tablespoonful of 

each of cold fish, chopped parsley 

and mashed 1 egg beaten 

potatoes pepper and salt 

Flake the fish and combine with the potatoes, seasonings 
and egg; form into small cakes and fry until brown on both 
sides in hot butter or hot olive oil. 



COD AU GRATIN 

Allow one middle steak of cod per person and allow to marinate 
by laying it in a flat dish and covering with a wineglassful of 
oil, the juice of a lemon and pepper and salt to taste. After 
two hours drain, sprinkle with breadcrumbs and grill on a hot 
grill first on one side then on the other. 



GRILLED SOLE 

As with cod, allow your sole to marinate for two hours in 
a marinade composed of a wineglassful of oil, the juice of half 
a lemon — or a whole lemon if liked — pepper and salt to 
taste; drain, cover with breadcrumbs and grill on a hot grill. 



In Tuscany there is a favourite fish dish, very rich, and 
extremely indigestible, but, having been warned, you may stili 
wish to try it: 

CACCIUCCO ALLA TOSCANA 

This dish is interesting if an assortment of fish is used. Try the 
combination of sole with red mullet. Wash and clean your fish 
and wipe dry. 

[ 103 ] ■_ 



Meanwhile, in a stewpan heat a couple of tablespoonsful 
of olive oil and in it brown a chopped onion, a crushed clove 
of garlic and a little chopped parsley ; add rather more than 
half a pound of fresh tomatoes, peeled and cut in small pieces, 
pepper and salt; when the tomatoes are cooked, add the juice 
of half a lemon, boil for a few minutes longer and then pass 
through a sieve or a food mill. Return the strained sauce to 
the stewpan, and in it cook your fish for half an hour or until 
tender; finally add a further tablespoonful of oil. Serve the 
fish on a heated dish with the sauce poured over and with 
it serve fingers of toast with which to soak up the sauce — you 
have been warned, this dish is rich, and somewhat indigestible. 



ARAGOSTA LESSATA 

Boiled lobster 

You'll probably prefer to buy him ready boiled, but if you 
can bear to cope with the live beast, he's much better boiled 
at home. Place your lobster in a deep saucepan of boiling water, 
so that he is completely covered, and boil him for three quarters 
of an hour if he is a large fellow, half an hour for his smaller 
brother, and at the end of that time, if you are going to eat 
him hot, remove him from the water, rub the shell with a little 
olive oil to brighten tiie colour, and split him in two lengthways, 
and serve with olive oil, lemon and salt and pepper. 



COLD LOBSTER 

Allow your lobster to cool before cutting open lengthways, 
then crack the claws so that the meat may be extracted easily, 
and serve with a green salad dressed with oil and lemon juice. 



[ 104 ] 



FRIED LOBSTER 

Having prepared your lobster, remove the meat from the body 
and the claws, dip them first in oil and then in flour seasoned 
with pepper and salt, or in a frying batter and fry in hot oil. 
Serve with sections of lemon. 



CRAWFISH 

These, known in some districts as 'lobster tails', may be substi- 
tuted for lobster in any of the foregoing recipes. 



SOFT SHELL CRABS 

These are tiny crabs caught at a time when they are changing 
their shells, and they are considered a delicacy in early May 
in Venice. Minus their shells the crabs rise to the surface of the 
water and are caught in great quantities. The method is to 
flour them and fry them while still alive in boiling oil — deli- 
cious if you like them and can forget the wholesale murder 
that has taken place to provide you with your dainty dish. 



CALAMARETTI 

Again a dish met with along the Adriatic coast, where baby 
inkfish the size of large house spiders are fried whole in butter, 
often accompanied by scampi — truly worth trying and rather 
less off-putting than the soft shell crabs if you are of a squeam- 
ish nature. 

If you are a lover of eels, here are a few typically Italian 
ways of preparing them. 



[ 105 ] 



ANGUILLA ALLA FERRARESE 

Eels as served in Ferrara 

TO SERVE 4 

IJ lbs. eels, salt and pepper 

cleaned and cut a pinch of mixed 
in slices an inch spice 

thick a pinch of thyme 

1 wineglassful 1 tgg lightly 
white wine beaten 

I bay leaf breadcrumbs 

Having prepared the eels, place in a casserole and over them 
pour the wine mixed with the spices and herbs, add the bay 
leaf. Cover and cook in a moderate oven for three quarters 
of an hour. At the end of that time, lift the eels from the sauce, 
drain, dip in oiled butter, then in beaten egg and breadcrumbs 
flavoured if liked with a little nutmeg, and fry brown on both 
sides in hot butter. 



ROAST EELS 

Large eels may be cut in thickish slices and cooked on a spit, 
with a bay leaf or two and a sprig of rosemary interspersed for 
flavour, and basted from time to time with olive oil and sprin- 
kled with salt. Since we in England cannot often cook in this 
fashion, the next best thing is to lay the slices in a flat dish, 
and pour over them a wineglassful of olive oil seasoned with 
salt and pepper and the juice of half a lemon; allow them to 
remain in this marinade for at least an hour, turning them 
from time to time so that it may penetrate the fish, then place 
in an oiled fireproof dish, and bake in a hot oven till tender, 
basting from time to time with the marinade. 



[ 106 ]- 



ROAST EELS 
A variation 

Instead of a bay leaf or two, use the same number of bruised 
leaves of sage, and so that the flavour may penetrate, lay the 
fish, when it comes to roasting it, on the sage leaves in an oiled 
fireproof dish. 



STEWED EELS i 

TO SERVE 4 

1 J lbs. eels 1 oz. butter 

2 tablespoons oil 1 teaspoonful 

2 leaves of sage, chopped parsley 

chopped 1 wineglassful white 
1 clove of garlic wine 

Skin and clean the eels and cut in pieces about 2 inches in 
length. Melt the oil and butter together in a stewpan, add 
the herbs, the garlic and the eels, and the wine ; cover closely 
and cook over moderate heat for three quarters of an hour, 
adding a little water from time to time if it shows signs of 
drying up. 



ARINGA ALLA GRATELLA 

Grilled herrings 

TO SERVE 4 

8 medium sized a little milk 

herrings 

Clean the herrings and split them open, removing the backbone. 
Lay them in a flat dish and cover with a little milk and leave 
them to soak for a couple of hours. Drain; oil them lightly, 
and grill on a hot grill, serving them with sections of lemon. 



[ 107 \ 



MERLUZZO ALLA FIORENTINA 

Cod, as cooked in Florence 

TO SERVE 4 



6 steaks of cod 


a little chopped 


salt and pepper 


fennel 


a wineglassful of 


oil 


white wine 


flour 



Oil a flat fireproof dish and in it place the lightly floured 
steaks of cod and over them pour a tablespoonful of olive oil, 
the fennel, pepper and salt and white wine and bake in a mod- 
erate oven for half an hour, basting at intervals with the sauce. 



MERLUZZO IN SALSA 

Cod with tomatoes 

TO SERVE 4 

6 steaks of cod 6 tomatoes, skinned 

1 tablespoon olive and cut in pieces 

oil 1 small onion 

chopped 

Heat the onion in a stewpan and in it brown the onion; add 
the tomato cut small and cook together for five minutes, add 
the fish, cover the pan and cook over moderate heat 30 minutes. 

We in England are apt to turn up our noses at the grey 
slabs of salt cod we see hanging in a fishmonger's shop, but the 
Italian cook can teach us several good ways of serving this 
ill-favoured fish. 

First of all it must be remembered that in order to render 
it acceptable at all it should be soaked for at least 24 hours, 
and if this can be done in running water, so much the better; 
failing that, change the water several times during the soaking 
process. At the end of the time, skin the fish, and remove the 
bones before starting any cooking experiments with it. In Italy 
it goes under two names, baccala and stoccafisso. 



[ 108 ]- 



STOCCAFISSO IN SALSA 

Salt cod in sauce 

TO SERVE 4 

2 lbs. of salt cod, salt and pepper 

soaked for at 1 medium onion 

least 24 hours, chopped small 

skinned and 1 stalk of celery 

boned chopped 

2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons 

1 medium sized tomato sauce 
beetroot 

Heat the oil in a stewpan and in it brown the onion for a few 
minutes, then add the beetroot, washed and cut in cubes, 
the celery, the cod, cut in small pieces, the salt and pepper 
and cook very slowly for at least two hours; when the beetroot 
is tender, add the tomato sauce and from time to time add 
a little water if the dish shows signs of drying. 



A variation 

Using the preceding recipe, substitute for the tomato sauce 
a wineglassful of white wine. 



[ 109 ] 



STOCCAFISSO ALLA LIGURE 

Salt cod as cooked in Liguria 

TO SERVE 4 

2 lbs. salt cod, soaked in water for at least 24 hours, 
skinned, boned and cut in small pieces 

1 onion cut in 1 clove garlic, 
small pieces crushed 

1 small carrot cut 1 stick celery cut 
in cubes small 

1 tablespoon 2 anchovies cut 
chopped parsley small 

pepper, salt and J lb. fresh mush- 
nutmeg rooms 

4 tomatoes, skinned 1 tablespoonful 
and seeded flour 

1 tablespoonful 
olive oil 

Heat the oil in a stewpan, and in it cook the chopped vegetables 
and anchovies for a few minutes, sprinkle with the flour, and 
add slowly about half a pint of warm water, stirring constantly. 
Finally add the fish, cut small, cover the stewpan and cook 
slowly for two hours or a little longer, adding more water 
from time to time if the dish looks like becoming too dry. 



CREAM OF BACCALA 

Creamed salt cod 

TO SERVE 4 

2 lbs. of the best cut of salt cod, soaked 24 hours, 
skinned and boned and then steamed for IJ hours 

Pound the fish in a mortar, adding a little olive oil from time 
to time and working till the whole is reduced to a creamy mass, 
adding, if it appears too dry, a little warm milk. At the end 
of the pounding, re-heat in a double boiler, then pile on a 
warmed dish and serve with slices of crisply fried bread. 



4 110 ] 



POLPETTINE DI STOCCOFISSO 

Rissoles of salt cod 

TO SERVE 4 

2 lbs. salt cod, pre- 2 beaten eggs 

pared as for cream 1 tablespoonful 
of baccala and chopped parsley 

allowed to cool a pinch of thyme 

Mix well together and form into small flat rissoles. Fry in hot 
oil and ser\^e with sections of lemon. 



TUNNY FISH AS COOKED 
IN SICILY 

For this dish the fresh tunny is needed, and the best cut is the 
stomach (ventresca), of which you should allow one thin slice 
per person. 

Lay the slices in a flat dish and cover with a dressing com- 
posed of half a wineglassful of white wine, salt, pepper, a pinch 
of nutmeg and the juice of half a lemon, and allow them to 
remain in this dressing for two hours, turning them from time 
to time so that the dressing can penetrate well. Drain, sprinkle 
with a little chopped fresh rosemary and a little crushed garlic, 
and grill on both sides on a hot grill, basting it with the dress- 
ing. When it is nicely browned on both sides, decorate it with 
one or two anchovies cut in strips before sending it to the table. 



TUNNY WITH PEAS 

Again for this dish you need thin sHces of fresh tunny, remem- 
bering that the 'ventresca' is the best cut. Brown on both sides 
in hot oil in a heavy pan, then add a medium sized onion 
chopped finely,' and a teaspoonful of finely chopped fresh 
parsley, and cook all together for ten minutes. Meanwhile, 
partly cook some fresh green peas, allovv^ing three or four ounces 
when sheUed to each slice of tunny fish ; drain and add to the 
pan in which the fish is cooking, add two tablespoonfuls of 
boiling water, and a similar quantity of tomato sauce (See 
'SAUCES') for each slice of fish, cover and cook slowly for 
a further twenty minutes. 

[ 111 ]^ 



TUNNY AS COOKED 
IN LIGURIA 

TO SERVE 4 



1 lb. tunny 
Ventresca' cut in

J pint white wine 
1 tablespoonful flour 



Heat the oil, add the flour, then slowly add the wine, the 
anchovies pounded to a paste and the other ingredients, except 
for the fish; allow to cook together for ten minutes, stirring 
frequently. Add the tunny fish, and pepper and salt to taste; 
cover the stewpan, and lower the heat, allowing to cook slowly 
for three quarters of an hour. Remove the fish to a hot dish, 
and to the sauce add a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and 
the juice of half a lemon ; bring this to boiling point and pour 
over the fish and serve hot. 




[ 112 ] 



STURGEON, HOUSEWIFE

chopped fresh of sherry 

parsley 1 egg, beaten lightly 

salt and pepper breadcrumbs for 

a pinch of nutmeg coating 

Mix together the chopped onion, parsley, salt, pepper and 
soaked bread, and use as a filling between each two slices of 
the fish. Dip the 'sandwiches' in the beaten egg and then in 
breadcrumbs, and fry in hot butter, fiirst on one side and then 
on the other, then pour over them the sherry, and allow to 
cook all together for quarter of an hour. Serve hot with the 
sauce poured over the slicei of fisb. 



TRIGLIE ALLA LIVORNESE 

Red mullet Leghorn style 

Allow one medium-sized red mullet per person. Remove the 
inside, the fins and the scales and wash well. Lay the fish side 
by side in a flat dish in which you have prepared a 'soffritto* 
of a tablespoonful of olive oil, a clove of garlic crushed, a little 
chopped fennel, salt and pepper, and cook in a hot oven for 
ten minutes; then cover with tomato sauce (See 'SAUCES') 
lower the heat slightly and allow to finish cooking, for a further 
half hour in a moderate ove*i.

FRIED RED MULLET 



1 medium sized fish 
per person 

2 tablespoons olive 
oil 

pepper and salt to 
taste 



salted anchovies 
1 clove garlic, 

crushed 
1 tablespoon 

chopped parsley 



Heat the oil, and in it fry the chopped anchovies, and allow 
the mullet to brown first on one side and then on the other; 
when brown, sprinkle over the fish the parsley and crushed 
garlic, lower the heat and allow to finish cooking — the mullet 
need about fifteen minutes cooking in all; just before removing 
from the fire, add a tablespoon of capers to the sauce and pour 
over the fish when serving. 



TRIGLIE ALLA LIGURE 

Red mullet as cooked in Liguria 

TO SERVE 4 



4 medium sized red

Heat the oil in a heavy pan and in it place the onion parsley, 
fennel and chopped mushrooms and anchovies, and allow 
to cook together for five minutes, then add the tomato sauce 
and white wine and cook for a further twenty minutes, stirring 
frequently. Meanwhile clean and prepare the fish and lay 
them side by side in a flat earthenware dish. When the sauce is 
cooked, pour over the fish, and place in a hot oven and cook 
for twenty minutes. 



[ 114 ] 



TRIGLIE ALLA TRIESTINA 

Red Mullet as cooked in Trieste 

TO SERVE 4 

4 red mullet of 1 tablespoonful 

medium size olive oil 

juice of half 1 tablespoonful 

a lemon chopped capers 
1 wineglassful 

white wine 

Heat together in a heavy pan the oil, lemon juice, capers and 
wine, and after ten minutes add the cleaned fish and allow 
to cook for twenty minutes, turning the fish carefully at the end 
of half this time. Serve hot. 



A GENOESE WAY OF COOKING 

FISH 

This method may be used to advantage when cooking trout, 
carp, eels, mackerel, etc. 

After preparing the fish for cooking, lay it in a stewpan, and 
cover with the following sauce, allowing it to cook gently for 
twenty minutes or half an hour or until tender. 

SAUC E 

1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoonful 

1 chopped onion flour 

\ wineglassful white \ pint water or 

wine fish stock 

\ oz. dried 1 tablespoonful to- 

mushrooms mato sauce 

salt and pepper 1 or two anchovies 

2 ozs. butter cut small 

Heat the oil and in it brown the onion. Then add the butter, 
and stir in the flour; slowly add the wine, water and tomato 
sauce, stirring all the time to make sure the mixture does not 
stick to the bottom of the pan; add the dried mushrooms, 
reconstituted in a little warm water and cut small, and the 

[ 115 ] 



anchovies and seasonings. Cook together for ten minutes, then 
pass through a sieve, and use as suggested when cooking trout, 
carp, mackerel, etc. It is also good with cod fillets. Just before 
serving, remove the fish and keep hot, and add to the sauce 
the juice of half a lemon; cook the sauce for a further two or 
three minutes and when serving, pour over the cooked fish. 
The fish section of an Italian cookery book would be far 
from complete if no reference were made to 'scampi', those 
natives of the waters of the Adriatic that, though they resemble 
our own Dublin Bay prawns, are plumper and have a some- 
what finer flavour. Since it is not easy to obtain 'scampi' at one's 
local fishmongers, Dublin Bay prawns may be substituted, 
though with a wishful thought for the finer flavour the dish 
would have 'if only' one were on the shores of the Adriatic and 
able to obtain the right ingredient with ease. 



FRIED SCAMPI 

For this you may suit your own particular fancy; allowing ten 
or a dozen per person, remove the shells, and fry the fish in 
any of these three ways : 

Dust lightly with flour and fry in hot olive oil, serving with 
sections of lemon. 

Dip first in beaten egg and then in crisp breadcrumbs and 
fry in hot oil or hot butter and serve with sections of lemon. 

Dip in a light frying batter and fry in hot butter, again 
serving with sections of lemon, or with Sauce Tartare (See 
'SAUCES').

of the fish and cook together for quarter of an hour. Meanvv^hile 
prepare the fish, add them to the sauce and cook over a mod- 
erate flame for a further quarter of an hour. Serve hot, 
covered with the sauce.

NASELLO CON PISELLI 

Whiting with peas 

TO SERVE 4 

4 whiting 1 medium sized on- 

1 tablespoonful ion, chopped fine 

chopped parsley 1 tablespoonful oil 

1 lb. shelled green 1 tablespoonful 

peas (weighed tomato conserve 

after shelling) 

Half cook the peas in boiling salted water and drain. Meanwhile, 
heat the oil in a stewpan, and in it brown the onion, parsley 
and the whiting; when the whiting is browned on both sides, 
add the drained peas, and the tomato conserve diluted with 
a little boiling water, and allow to cook for a further fifteen 
minutes over moderate heat. 



CURLED WHITING 

If you can persuade your fishmonger to prepare whiting in 
the old-fashioned way, skinning them and passing the tail 
through the eye sockets, allowing one per person, flour the 
fish lightly and fry a golden brown on both sides in hot butter 
in a heavy frying pan. Serve with sections of lemon. 



PESCI ACCARTOCCIATI 

Fish in paper cases 

You will need pieces of greaseproof paper, one for each piece 
of fish to be cooked, and of a size large enough to envelop the 
fish entirely and wrap well over so that no juices escape. Oil 
the pieces of paper on one side, and oil whatever fish you are 
planning to cook, and lay it on the paper, after sprinkling 
it with salt and pepper, a little chopped onion, a scraping of 
garlic, chopped parsley or other herbs you may fancy, half 

[ 118 ] 



a bay leaf if you like the flavour. Close the paper by folding the 
edges together carefully so that the juices cannot escape, and 
cook in a moderate oven. The fish is served in its paper enve- 
lopes, so that each person may be served with the fish with the 
sauce unescaped. 

This is an excellent method of cooking trout, steaks of salmon, 
steaks of turbot, cod or halibut, or whole prepared mackerel. 



FISHTOBOIL 

A wise precaution is to wrap fish intended for boiling in a piece 
of muslin ; this prevents it breaking when it is removed from the 
saucepan in w^hich it has boiled. 

Allow ten minutes per pound. 

Start your fish in cold water, in which you have placed three 
or four peppercorns, a bay leaf and either a tablespoonful of 
vinegar or the juice of half a lemon, and bring it to the boil 
quite slowly; once boiling, allow it to simmer for the required 
time. 



FISH, TO ROAST 

In a great many native Italian recipes you will notice the in- 
struction to toast the fish 'alio spiedo' (on a spit), and since this 
is an implement not often to be found in the English kitchen, 
roasting in the oven has to be substituted. The oven should be 
hot, and the fish scored across with a knife and brushed with 
olive oil, and placed on an oiled grid in a baking dish or tin. 
Allow about ten minutes per pound and baste from time to time 
with oil and any juices that may have fallen into the roasting 
dish. Sprinkle with salt before serving.

OSTRICHE ALLA VENEZIANA 
Oysters^ Venetian style 

At the risk of being accused of heresy for suggesting methods of 
cooking oysters, I would suggest trying this Venetian method. 

Allow half a dozen oysters per person ; open the fish, loosen 
them in their shells, and to each add a little of the following 
mixture, and a few drops of olive oil before grilling under a hot 
grill. Serve with sections of lemon. 

MIXTURE 



I tablespoon chopped 

fresh parsley 
1 stalk of celery 

chopped finely 
1 clove of garlic, 

crushed 



a pinch of chopped 

fresh thyme 
pepper to taste 
1 tablespoonful crisp 

breadcrumbs 



PIGS IN BLANKETS 

Oysters again, and oysters cooked. Allow six per person, remove 
from the shells, wrap each oyster in a strip of ham or streaky 
bacon, and fry in hot butter. 



OR WITHOUT BLANKETS 

Omitting the wrapping of ham or bacon, dip the shelled oysters 
first in beaten tgg and then in breadcrumbs and fry in hot but- 
ter. Serve with sections of lemon. 



[ 120 j 



FRITTO MISTO MARE 

Mixed Fried Fish 

If you go to Italy, and having visited a town on the coast come 
away without having eaten at least one dish of Fritto Misto 
Mare, then you might almost as well have stayed at home. In 
Venice you will probably be served with a mixture of tiny 
octopus, not much larger than a hefty house spider, scampi, 
and minute mullet, all dipped in a light batter and fried in hot 
oil, drained and served with sections of lemon. 

Farther south you may meet some peculiar white circles in 
your Fritto Misto Mare that have a more than slight resem- 
blance in texture to the pencil eraser of school days. Rubber it 
isn't, but ink-fish it is, and it should previously have undergone 
a fairly lengthy operation of skinning, having its insides re- 
moved, its eyes and ink-bag removed also, and the balance boiled 
until tender, and this may take up to an hour if you want to 
avoid that too-great resemblance to pencil eraser texture. 
When tender, and not before, the ink-fish should be cut into 
rings, and if you're frying your own Fritto Misto Mare, allow 
six of these per person, with the same number of scampi and 
one or two tiny mullet. 



CLAMS OR MUSSELS COOKED 
WITH EGGS 

AUow about IJ pints of the fish per person. 

Before cooking, leave them in slightly salted water for two 
hours so that they may open and the sand may come out of 
them. 

Meanwhile prepare in a heavy pan a 'soffritto' of two table- 
spoonsful of oil in which you have browned a small chopped 
onion and a teaspoonful of chopped parsley ; add the fish and, 
when they are opened, add the beaten yolks of two or three 
eggs, depending on the quantity of fish, and the juice of half 
a lemon. Stir the mixture, and keep it just below boiling point, 
and serve as soon as it is well mixed. 



-[ 121 ] 



CLAMS or MUSSELS, 
FIS;^HERMEN'S STYLE 

Having cleaned the fish, place them in a covered pan over 
a fairly strong heat until they begin to open; uncover the pan 
at this point, and sprinkle the fish with chopped parsley and 
crushed garlic, and serve as soon as all are opened. You will 
find they make sufficient juice of their own not to require 
additional liquid. 



SOLE WITH WHITE WINE 

Allow one medium sized sole per person. Skin and remove the 
head and fins and dust with flour. Heat a little butter in a heavy 
pan until it bubbles, lay in the fish and cook first on one side 
then the other, then pour over it a wineglassful of white wine 
for each fish, and a little fish stock made from boiling together 
the head, skin and fins. Reduce the heat and cook gently until 
tender, by which time the sauce will have reduced in volume. 
When serving, strain the sauce over the fish. 

The substitution of cider for white wine is well worth trying. 



SOLE FRIED IN OIL 

Allow one medium-sized fish per person; skin, remove head 
and fins. Dip first in flour and then in beaten egg, and fry 
quickly, first on one side then on the other, in hot oil until 
light golden brown. Serve very hot with sections of lemon. 



[ 122 ] 



PIKE 
to be eaten cold 

Prepare a good sized pike by scraping off the scales, removing 
the inside, and cutting off the fins. Tie in a cloth and place in 
a large saucepan or fish kettle with half a wineglassful of white 
wine, a wineglassful of water, a bay leaf, a pinch of thyme, a 
chopped carrot, a stalk of celery cut small, a tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley, a clove of garlic, two cloves and salt to taste. 
Bring to the boil and cook slowly, allowing ten to twelve min- 
utes per pound. When cooked, allow to cool in its own broth, 
then strain and serve cold with a piquant sauce. 



Or, if you like, to be eaten hot 

When the fish is cooked, instead of allowing it to cool, lift from 
the fish kettle, remove the cloth in which it has been cooked, 
and serve immediately with any sauce you fancy, either a pi- 
quant sauce, or one of the tomato sauces (See 'SAUCES). 



PIKE AU GRATIN 

Clean a medium sized pike and allow to marinate in olive oil 
for half an hour or so. Sprinkle with salt and crisp breadcrumbs 
and grill on both sides until brown. Serve hot with sections of 
lemon. 



TROUT or CARP 

These when cleaned may be prepared in a similar manner and 
are excellent. 

Many Italian cooks prepare fish and meats by cooking on 
a spit; since this is an implement rarely to be found in English 
kitchens, English cooks have to content themselves by using 
a grill where a 'spit' has been prescribed. 



[ 123 ] 



TENCH 

Having cleaned your tench, allow to marinate for half an hour 
in olive oil to which has been added a little chopped fresh 
rosemary, pepper and salt. Drain and grill on both sides and 
serve very hot. 



GRILLED GREY MULLET 

Allow one medium sized grey mullet per person. Scrape off 
the scales with the back of a knife, clean and wipe dry. Oil all 
over and sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook on a hot 
grill, first on one side then on the other. 



RED MULLET 

These should be eaten very fresh. Allow one per person. Scrape 
off the scales, and clean, removing all the inside except the 
Hver ; wash well, wipe dry, oil all over, sprinkle with pepper and 
salt and grill first on one side and then on the other and serve 
hot. 



STURGEON 

If you intend cooking a whole sturgeon, choose a fairly small 
fish. Scrape off the scales with the back of a knife, clean and 
remove the inside ; wash and wipe dry. Make several small holes 
with the point of a knife and in these insert fillets of salted ancho- 
vy. Place in a vessel and cover with two wineglasses of oil, salt, 
and the juice of two lemons, a little chopped parsley and 
chopped thyme. Leave for 2 hours. Remove and drain; wrap in 
greaseproof paper and bake in a moderate oven for 1 hour; 
remove the paper and cook for a further 20 to 25 minutes, 
basting during this time with the mixture in which it v/as 
allowed to marinate Serve very hot. 



[ 124 ]- 



ROAST TUNNY FISH 

After our own brief acquaintance with beige-coloured tunny 
fish in small tins, it is a startling thing to behold one's first piece 
of 'tunny in the raw', a huge, liver-coloured piece of fish on 
a fishmonger's slab in Naples or the towns of Sicily. 

For roast tunny take a fairly thick slice of fresh tunny and 
place it in an earthenware vessel with half a wineglassful of oil, 
some chopped parsley, chopped onion, the juice of a lemon, 
one or two cloves and salt and pepper to taste. Allow it to 
remain in this marinade for a couple of hours, turning from 
time to time. Drain, sprinkle with breadcrumbs and bake in the 
oven for 1 hour or a little longer, ba':iting from time to time with 
the marinading mixture. 



CAPPON MAGRO 

If you are expecting guests for a buffet supper, and know them 
to be lovers of fish, you could prepare few things more appetis- 
ing than this famous fish salad, originating in Genoa, but likely 
to be found in any seaside town in Italy. But be warned, it takes 
a lot of time for shopping, and for preparation, and it is costly. 
The recipe given below should prove sufficient for a party of 
eight or nine. 

First of all, look out your handsomest round or oval serving 
dish, for this is a 'dressed up' dish. Next, if you want to do the 
job properly, procure half a pound of ships' biscuits, break them 
up, and soak them overnight in a tablespoonful of olive oil 
mixed with an equal quantity of vinegar. If you don't like the 
sound of the ships' biscuits, dry half a dozen slices of bread in 
the oven, and when they are crisp, treat them as suggested for 
the ships' biscuits. Next, prepare a selection of vegetables in 
season, say half a pound or more of small new potatoes, and 
similar quantities of shelled fresh green peas, French beans, 
young carrots, cauliflower; cook them separately in boiling, 
salted water — don't overcook — drain and set on one side. 
Prepare a head of celery, | a pound of button mushrooms, 
2 ounces black olives, a similar quantity of green olives, and 
four hard boiled eggs; a small jar of preserved artichoke hearts 
would add interest to the dish; one or two small cooked beetroot 

r 125 ] 



would be colourful — and this is a dish where colour matters. 
Cut the mushrooms in pieces and marinate with a little oil and 
vinegar, pepper and salt. 

Where fish is concerned, prepare a boiled lobster, J a pint 
of shrimps or prawns ; half a dozen scallops ; and two pounds of 
some good white fish, turbot, sole or halibut. 

Poach the white fish and the scallops for seven minutes, lift 
from the water, flake and season with oil, lemon juice, pepper 
and salt. Shell the shrimps, and remove the lobster from its 
shell, and season these also with oil, lemon juice and pepper and 
salt. 

Next prepare the special sauce for Cappon Magro : 

1 teaspoon chopped 1 clove garlic 

parsley 2 tablespoons capers 

6 anchovies 2 or 3 gherkins 

1 tablespoon chopped 4 egg yolks (2 raw, 

nuts 2 hard boiled) 

a pinch of oregano 2 tablespoons vinegar 

J pint olive oil 6 green olives 

1 tablespoon grated 1 thick slice of 

fennel root bread, soaked in 

vinegar and 
squeezed dry 

Place the parsley and garlic in a mortar and pound to a paste, 
add capers, olives (having removed the stones), gherkins, 
fennel, hard boiled egg yolks, bread, nuts and oregano; when 
all pounded to a paste, slowly add the oil, the vinegar and the 
two raw egg yolks, stirring with a wooden spoon; the finished 
sauce should have the consistency of mayonnaise. 

All ingredients being now ready, you may start your dish. 
First of all arrange a platform of the ships' biscuits or bread, 
and on it spread a little of the sauce ; next arrange the various 
ingredients attractively in pyramid fashion on the platform of 
ships' biscuits, a layer of flaked fish, a layer of assorted vegeta- 
bles, a layer of the sauce and so on until all are used up. The 
bright-coloured vegetables, the sliced beetroot, peas and small 
or diced carrots, may be used as garnishes, as may a few un- 
shelled prawns, the lobster claws, cracked for easy eating, and 
the quartered hard boiled eggs. This dish should, of course, 
be served very cold, and the 'prettier' it is in appearance the 
better. 

[ 126 ] : 



Snails & Frogs 

You probably won't fancy them, and in any case you probably 
won't be obtaining the live snails in this country, but just in 
case you want to know, you have to starve the creatures for 
a fortnight so that they lose all their slime and scum. During 
this time, to prevent their wandering, you have to keep them in 
a basket, wrapping them loosely in a cloth, which for hygienic 
reasons it will pay you to change fairly frequently. If you can 
stand this test of endurance, at the end of the time soak the 
snails in salted water with a dash of vinegar for three or four 
hours, washing them after that in running water until there is 
no trace left of the scum or slime. Boil them next in salted water 
for \\ hours, after which strain them and remove them from 
their shells, cutting away the black portion that you will find on 
the end of the body. After all this preparation, you may proceed 
to cook the snails as you fancy. 

One good way of cooking them is to prepare fifty or sixty in 
the manner suggested, remembering that a dozen snails are 
none too many for a snail-fancier. 

When the snails are finally prepared, place a tablespoonful 
of oil in a stewpan, allow it to heat and in it cook together for 
five minutes a crushed clove of garlic, a chopped medium-sized 
onion, a pinch of chopped fresh rosemary, and a teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley. At the end of this time add your shelled snails 
together with half an ounce of dried mushrooms that have been 
reconstituted in a little warm water and cut small, and two table- 
spoonsful of tomato sauce ; cook together for ten minutes, then 
add a wineglassful of white wine and allow to cook slowly for 
ten minutes longer, and serve hot — they're well worth all the 
trouble and fasting. 

What with all this about frogs and snails, you'll probably 
expect 'puppy dogs' tails' to be included in the culinary cata- 
logue, but disappointed though you may be, there is, to my 
knowledge, no recipe for these in the Italian repertoire. 

Frogs, however, the Italian variety, make good eating. Try 
them fried. 

Skin them, removing the head and the inside, cutting off the 
feet and washing them well, then leave them to soak in water to 
which a little salt has been added for two or three hours. Drain 



[ 127 ]~ 



them and then cut in pieces and marinate them for an hour in 
a Uttle oil to which you have added a chopped onion, a Httle 
parsley, a bay leaf, a little chopped thyme and/or rosemary, 
pepper and salt and the juice of half a lemon. Drain, and flour 
them lightly and fry in hot oil or butter. 
Or for a more elaborate experiment try — 



RANE ALLA GASTALDA 

Prepare the frogs as suggested for fried frogs, but when they 
have soaked in water two or three hours, dry them, but do not 
cut them in pieces, truss them with the legs crossed over the 
body, flour them lightly, then brown them in a stewpan with 
a little butter flavoured with chopped parsley, a crushed clove 
of garlic, pepper and salt. When they are browned all over add 
half an ounce of dried mushrooms reconstituted in warm water 
and cut in pieces, and two wineglassfuls of white wine, and cook 
over moderate heat in a covered pan for half an hour or until 
they are tender. Serve with sections of lemon.

Meats 



The following pages give but a small selection from the 
numerous ways Italian cooks have of cooking beef, veal, 
mutton, pork, and the various edible entrails classed in 
English butchers' shops as 'offal'. 

To the casual visitor to the country, it might appear that no 
calf is allowed to grow to maturity, since 'vitello' (veal) makes 
so frequent an appearance on all menus, but living in the coun- 
try one meets fairly frequently all the meats eaten in this country 
of ours, plus several unfamiliar to us, as, for example, young kid, 
which in taste greatly resembles lamb. 

Sucking pig and equally youthful lambs are delicacies to be 
met with in Italy, and, despite their over-richness, they are 
delicious. Recipes for these have not been given, however, 
since they are so rarely met with nowadays in England.

With the point of a sharp knife make several small holes in the 
piece of beef and into these stuff strips of streaky bacon; season 
with pepper, salt and nutmeg. 

Having prepared your piece of meat in this fashion, place it 
in a stewpan with about an ounce of butter, a little beef marrow 
if available, and the chopped vegetables and allow to brown 
slowly, turning the meat so that it browns on all sides ; then add 
meat stock nearly to cover it. Cover the stewpan and cook over 
slow heat for 2| or 3 hours. When half cooked, add the 
tomato conserve diluted with some of the broth, and continue 
cooking till the meat^is tender, by which time the broth should 
be reduced in quantity and thickened. Serve in a dish, surround- 
ed by the broth.

wine in the proportions of two to one, and cook slowly with the 
lid on the stewpan for 2 J or 3 hours. At the end of that time, 
remove the meat to a hot dish, skim the fat off the gravy and 
pour over the meat. 



COSCIA DI MANZO 
ALLA CASALINGA 

Rump steak housewife fashion 

Take a piece of rump steak, and 'lard' it by pricking with the 
point of a sharp knife and pushing strips of fat bacon into the 
incisions; season with pepper, salt and nutmeg, and wrap in 
two or three slices of fat ham or bacon. Place in a casserole with 
a chopped onion, a cupful of meat stock and half a wineglassful 
of white wine and allow to cook slowly in a moderate oven for 
two and a half or three hours. 



MANZO ALLA MASSAIA 

Beef domestic style 

Cut two pounds of stewing beef into small pieces and place in 
a stewpan with a little olive oil, a chopped onion, a teaspoonful 
of chopped parsley and salt and pepper. Allow to brown a little 
then cover with stock or cold water and cook slowly for 2 J 
hours in a covered pan. An hour before serving time, by which 
time the broth will be somewhat reduced, make up to the origi- 
nal quantity by adding tomato sauce (See 'SAUCES').

STUFATO ALLA FIORENTINA 

Stew as cooked in Florence 

2 lbs. stewing beef cut 1 teaspoonful 

in pieces for . chopped rosemary 

serving } wineglassful red 

2 tablespoonsful wine 

olive oil 1 tablespoonful to- 

3 cloves of garlic, mato conserve 
crushed 

Heat the oil and in it allow the garlic and rosemary to brown 
before adding the meat; allow the meat also to brown, then 
reduce heat and add \ a wineglassful of red wine, and the tomato 
conserve diluted with a similar quantity of meat stock or water. 
Cover the pan and cook slowly for 2\ hours, adding more hot 
stock or boiUng water from time to time if the meat looks like 
becoming dry. 

If liked, potatoes peeled and cut in pieces may be added to the 
stewpan an hour before serving, so that they absorb the flavour 
of the merit as they cook. 

Veal 

Where veal is concerned, if you are able to buy it from a Conti- 
nental butcher, do so, for you will find he has a better idea of 
cutting up veal for cutlets and escalopes than his British coun- 
terpart. Excellent veal can be procured in Soho from the shop 
of Benoit Bulcke in Old Compton Street, and there are other 
good Continental butchers to be found in other parts of London 
and in most large cities. 

If you are buying veaJ for *escalopes'« you need thin slices 
of the lean meat cut from the leg or from the fillet, and if you 
are not the possessor of a^ 'cutlet bat', remember to ask your 
butcher to flatten the escalopes for you with his cleaver; this 
type of rough treatment means a far more tender finished dish, 
and an escalope, remember, should be tender enough almost 
to melt in the mouth when eaten. 

It's as well to be extravagant when cooking veal, using butter 
for frying, rather than dripping; butter costs a little more, but 
the flavour is lighter and far more delicious when veal is fried 
crisp in good butter. 

^ ^ — _, [ 132 ]— - — ---• — 



COSTOLETTE or SCALOPPE 
MILANESE 

Either a cutlet or an escalope of veal may be cooked 'alia Mila- 
nese'. In either case allow one or one and a half per person, 
depending upon the size, and before starting to cook, either 
flatten the meat yourself with a cutlet bat, or have the butcher 
flatten it for you. 

If you want to be truly Milanese, you will allow your meat 
to marinate in a bath of milk for an hour or so before starting 
to cook it, but this refinement may be omitted without any real 
detriment to the finished dish. 

Remove all fat and grisde. 

Coat your cutlets or escalopes in beaten egg which has been 
seasoned with salt and pepper; allow surplus egg to drip off, 
then dip the meat in fine toasted breadcrumbs before frying it 
on both sides in a generous amount of hot butter. Cook quickly 
on one side until golden, then turn and cook the other, and 
lift out of the pan with a perforated slice so that any surplus 
fat goes back into the pan. Serve with quartered lemons and 
a garnish of parsley. 

You may either serve these hot, with a green salad, or having 
drained them well, and allowed them to cool, they are equally 
delicious served cold. 



SCALOPPINE AL MARSALA 

The combination of thin, crisply fried pieces of veal with Mar- 
sala is an experiment well worth trying. 

Scaloppine, known sometimes by the name of 'piccate', are 
much smaller than escalopes ; they are cut very thin and should 
not be much more than 2 inches square. Three or four per 
person is the usual allowance. 

Beat your scaloppine flat, and flour them with flour that has 
been seasoned with pepper and salt. In a frying pan large 
enough to accommodate them, if possible, in one layer, heat 
a fairly generous knob of butter, and when it is really hot, brown 
the scaloppine very quickly on each side. While they are still 
in the pan, add about a tablespoonful of Marsala for every four 
scaloppine, and bring to a bubbling boil; add a teaspoonful of 

[ 133 ] 



chicken stock for each tablespoonful of Marsala ; stir well, and 
allow to cook for a few moments under a lower heat. Remember 
that one essential of this dish is QUICK cooking; altogether 
the process should take under ten minutes. 
Serve very hot. 



SCALOPPE ALLA MODENESE 

Allow one or one and a half escalopes per person ; flatten them 
with a cutlet bat, coat with egg and breadcrumbs and fry in hot 
butter. Then place the escalopes side by side in a flat fireproof 
dish, and on top of each place a slice of ham, and on top of that 
a thin slice of Gruyere cheese. Place in a hot oven, and serve 
immediately the cheese has melted. 



SCALOPPE or COSTOLETTE 
DI VITELLO AL SUGO 

Prepare your escalopes as for SCALOPPE ALLA MILANESE 
then arrange them in a flat fireproof dish, and over them pour 
hot tomato sauce (see 'SAUCES') which will be all the better 
if when making it you have added a bay leaf. 
Serve hot, with a green salad. 



VITELLO TONNATO 

Veal with Tunny Fish 

Remove the skin and fat from a piece of leg of veal; remove the 
bone, and stick the meat with small fillets of anchovy. Tie it 
firmly and allow it to boil for 1 J hours in a saucepan, covered 
completely with water in which have been placed a small onion, 
two cloves, a bay leaf, a little chopped celery, parsley and salt. 
At the end of this time, lift the meat from the water — reserving 
the broth to form the basis of a minestrone. Untie the meat, cut 
it in slices and place in a dish covered with the following sauce, 
in which it should be left for two days, after which it should be 
served cold, with the sauce served in a separate vessel. 

[ 134, ] 



SAUCE FOR VITELLO TONNATO 

Mince the contents of a 4 oz. tin of tunny fish with two ancho- 
vies, and pass through a sieve or a food mill, adding olive oil and 
lemon juice in the proportions of three parts of oil to one of 
lemon juice, and finally adding a few chopped capers. 



VITELLO IN UMIDO 
CON PISELLI 

Veal stew with peas 

2 lbs. lean veal butter or oil for 

meat stock and/or browning 

tomato sauce J lb. fresh green peas 

(weighed after 
shelling) 

Heat a little butter or oil in a stewpan, and in it brown the 
veal, which has been cut into 2-inch pieces. Add several table- 
spoonfuls of hot stock and/or tomato sauce (See 'SAUCES'), 
cover and cook gently for half an hour, adding a little more 
stock if it looks like drying out; add the peas, and simmer gently 
for a further 1 J hours. 



BRACIUOLE DI VITELLO 
ALLA VERONESE 

Veal chops in the Veronese style 

Allow one chop per person, and while these are 
being grilled, prepare the following sauce : 

2 cloves of garlic 2 or 3 anchovies 

1 tablespoon from which bones 

chopped parsley have been removed 

2 ozs. butter 



[ 135 1 



Pound together all the ingredients except the butter in a mortar 
until a paste is formed, then add the butter and cream well 
together. Pour into the dish in which the chops are to be 
served, and keep hot over a saucepan of boiling water. When the 
chops are cooked, arrange in the dish and serve hot with sections 
of lemon. 



VITELLO IN FRICASSEA 

FricassSe of veal 

Cut lean veal into small pieces. Fry an onion until golden brown 
in a little butter; add the pieces of veal and brown on all sides; 
cover with boiling stock, lower the heat and allow to cook until 
about half the liquid is evaporated (about \ an hour). Mean- 
while, beat two or three egg yolks with the juice of half a lemon 
and a little chopped parsley, and when the veal has finished 
cooking, add the egg and lemon mixture, removing the stew- 
pan from the heat so as not to curdle the eggs. Mix well and 
serve hot. 



ROAST VEAL 

Allow about 30 minutes to the pound at 300 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Pound together a clove of garlic and an anchovy, and rub these 
over the roast of veal before cooking. Cover the meat with 
strips of fat bacon or salt pork to prevent its drying out, and 
cook in a casserole with a little butter. Be careful if you are 
salting it not to overdo this, as the anchovy will have made 
it fairly salty. At the end of the cooking, add a half a glass of red 
wine to the gravy, and baste the veal with this before removing 
from the oven. 



OSSOBUCO 

This is the knuckle of veal, rich and tasty when prepared 'Alia 
Milanese'. 



[ 136 ] 



OSSOBUCO ALL A MILANESE 

TO SERVE 4 

Allow one small 2 or 3 ozs. butter 

knuckle of veal flour 

per person, and salt and pepper 

it should be sawn 1 wineglassful dry- 
nearly through in white wine 

sections about IJ 1 tablespoonful 
or 2 inches long, chopped parsley 

so that one has 1 anchovy 

a number of sections grated rind of half 
of bone, each a lemon 

surrounded by a stock or water 
circle of muscle. 

Heat the butter in a heavy pan large enough to accommodate 
the veal knuckles in one layer; flour the knuckles and brown 
on both sides in the hot butter, seasoning with salt and pepper; 
add the wine, and continue cooking until the wine has almost 
evaporated, then add stock or water just to cover the meat; 
cover closely, and cook slowly for at least an hour, adding more 
stock if it looks as though the meat is drying. Meanwhile pound 
together in a mortar the garlic, anchovy, lemon rind and parsley, 
and five minutes before serving, add to the gravy, and bring to 
the boil, stirring with a wooden spoon. 

It is customary to serve Ossobuco with a plain Risotto, col- 
oured with saffron; this, incidentally, is the only instance of 
rice served with a meat dish. 



AGNELLO ARROSTO 

Roast Lamb 

Try I'basting a leg of lamb Italian fashion. Before putting it in 
the oven, make a slit in the flesh near the bone and into this 
place one or two cloves of garlic and a sprig of rosemary. Oil 
the meat lightly all over, and place in a hot oven, allowing 15 
minutes to the pound and 15 minutes over, and basting from 
time to time with oil, and, to make it even more delicious, 1 5 min- 
utes before serving, pour over it a wineglassful of white wine 
and baste finally with the juices that have run into the roast- 
ing pan. 

[ 137 ] 



AGNELLO O CAPRETTO 
IN CASSERUOLA 

Lamb or Kid Pot Roast 

Kid is eaten a great deal in Italy and the flesh of young goats 
makes excellent eating. Try a leg of either kid or lamb stuck 
at intervals with rosemary, salted, and then browned on all sides 
in a stewpan in which two tablespoonsful of olive oil have been 
heated. Cover the stewpan when the flesh is browned on all 
sides, and allow it to cook slowly, 15 minutes to the pound, in 
the steam that will develop in the stewpan once it is covered. 



PORK COOKED IN MILK 
*ALLA BOLOGNESE' 

For this you need a piece of loin of pork, boned and with some 
of its fat removed. If you are going to cook it in the true Bolo- 
gnese manner, you will prepare it overnight by sprinkling with 
salt and pepper and leaving till morning, but this treatment is 
not absolutely essential if time is at a premium. 

If you are preparing the meat the day you are cooking, sprin- 
kle it with salt and black pepper before rolling it up, and it is 
an improvement if a clove of garlic is sliced thin and rolled up 
in the centre of the meat, together with a few seeds of coriander 
or fennel. 

Use a saucepan that is more or less the size of theVoUed joint, 
and when the pork is ready for the pan, heat a little butter in it 
and brown the pork all over. 

Heat the milk, allowing roughly a pint of milk to each pound 
of pork, and pour over the meat. Cover the saucepan and allow 
to simmer gently for an hour or a little longer; uncover, and 
allow to cook for another half hour, by which time the quantity 
of liquid will be reduced considerably, and it should be a golden 
brown in colour. Take care that the saucepan does not go dry ; 
if there is any danger of this, add a little more hot milk. 

The joint is excellent hot, served with the sauce from the 
cooking, and if you are able to add a few sliced truffles to this 
it is all the better. 

Another addition is that of a chopped onion and a rasher of 
bacon cut in small pieces, and cooked in the butter before the 
pork is browned. 

« 

[ 138 ] 



LOIN OF PORK 
as cooked in Tuscany 

Again your loin pork should be boned and some of its fat should 
be removed before cooking, and before rolling it should be 
stuck with a few rosemary leaves and a few slivers of garlic, 
and seasoned with salt and pepper. Roll and tie it and roast in 
the oven in the usual fashion, allowing 25 to 30 minutes per 
pound, plus 25 or 30 minutes over. This is excellent allowed to 
cool and served with a potato salad. 

And as cooked in Perugia 

Here, instead of rosemary, fennel leaves are used, and when the 
meat is cooked and served cold, it is a good touch to serve with 
it a potato salad with which has been mixed a little thinly sliced 
fennel. 

PORK CHOPS 
*ALLA NAPOLITANA' 

TO SERVE 6 

The Neapolitans use a lot of green and red and yellow peppers 
in their cooking, and these 'marry' well with pork. For this 
recipe take: 

6 pork chops oil for cooking 

2 red or yellow salt and pepper 

peppers 1 clove of garlic, 

J lb. mushrooms crushed 

1 tablespoonful to- 
mato paste 

Heat oil in a heavy pan, fry garlic in it till pale brown, add the 
chop's and brown on both sides; add salt and pepper. Remove 
from the pan and keep warm. Meanwhile, dilute the tomato 
paste with a little water and add to the pan in which the chops 
have been cooked, remove the seeds and stem from the peppers 
and chop them finely, and add these to the pan together with 
the chopped mushrooms; cover and cook slowly for about 
quarter of an hour, then replace the chops, cooking together 
for another twenty minutes or so. Serve very hot.

FEGATO ALLA SPAGNOLA 

Liver as served in Spain 

TO SERVE 6 

1 J lbs. calf's liver 1 dozen small firm 
2 large onions sliced tomatoes 

thinly into rings 1 lemon 

sprigs of parsley oil 

flour salt and pepper 

[ 141 ] 



Heat the grill, and meanwhile, dip the liver — sliced to about 
the thickness of half an inch — in the flour, then into oil, and 
grill first on one side then on the other. Set on one side to keep 
warm, and having seasoned the tomatoes with salt, pepper and 
oil, grill these also. While this is going on, fry the onions until 
a golden yellow. Have ready a large flat dish, and pile the 
onions into a pyramid in the centre, with the slices of liver 
around, garnished with grilled tomatoes and sprigs of parsley, 
and the lemon cut into sections. 



FEGATO ALL' ITALIANA 

Liver in the Italian style 

TO SERVE 6 

1 J lbs. calf's liver, flour 

cut into thin pepper and salt 

slices 1 lemon 

2 ozs. butter 

Heat the butter very hot in a large heavy frying pan. Flour the 
slices of liver and fry quickly, first on one side and then on the 
other, the whole process to take not more than five or six minu- 
tes. Season with pepper and salt, add a small knob of butter, 
and shake the pan well so that it is distributed over the slices 
of liver. Remove the pan from the fire, and sprinkle the liver 
with the juice of half a lemon before removing to a hot dish for 
serving. Serve very hot. 

Having tried out these two fairly conservative methods of 
cooking liver, how about trying a Tuscan specialty, as per the 
following recipe : 



[ 142 ] 



FEGATO ALLA TOSCANA 

TO SERVE 6 

1 i lbs. calf's liver cut a good tablespoonful 

into thin slices of fresh sage leaves 

flour chopped small 

oil 1 lemon, cut into 

pepper and salt sections 

Flour the liver, and fry in hot oil very quickly ; before removing 
from the stove, season with pepper and salt, and the sage leaves 
cut small. Serve very hot accompanied by sections of lemon. 



Or, having enjoyed veal escalopes alia Milanese, why not 
try liver treated similarly? 

FEGATO ALLA MILANESE 

TO SERVE 6 

IJ lbs. calf's liver, 1 beaten egg 

cut into thin slices breadcrumbs 

flour butter for frying 

pepper and salt 1 lemon 

a tablespoon 
chopped parsley 

For this recipe, start preparations an hour and a quarter before 
you wish to serve the dish, for the slices of liver are spread on 
a flat dish, seasoned with salt, pepper and the chopped parsley 
and left to 'mind their own business' for a good hour. At the end 
of this time, heat the butter in a heavy pan ; flour the liver, then 
dip in beaten egg, and then into crisp breadcrumbs, and fry 
quickly first on one side and then on the other. Arrange on 
a flat, heated dish, pour over the Uver the remainder of the 
butter in which it was fried, and garnish with sections of lemon 
and sprigs of parsley. 



While in Venice the method is strongly reminiscent of 'liver 
and onions', except that oil is used for cooking whereas we 
normally use lard or dripping: 

[ 143 ] 



FEGATO ALLA VENEZIANA 

For each person allow about a quarter of a pound of liver and 
one large onion cut into rings. Heat the oil in a heavy pan and 
in it cook the onions until they are a golden yellow; add the 
liver — floured — and cook quickly on either side, season 
with salt and pepper and serve piled upon a bed of the fried 
onions. 

Then, for real luxury, why not try liver cooked with arti- 
chokes? Since 'Globe' artichokes are not always easy to obtain 
in this country, you may have to make do with the bottled or 
tinned variety, well drained. 



LIVER WITH ARTICHOKES 

For each person allow quarter of a pound of calf's liver, and one 
or two artichokes. 

In a heavy pan fry a chopped onion in a little oil until it is 
golden brown; lower the heat and add the artichokes divided 
into sections, and cook slowly for twenty minutes or so until the 
artichokes are tender; increase the heat, add the floured liver 
and cook quickly on first one side then the other; remove from 
the heat, season with salt, pepper and a tablespoonful of finely 
chopped parsley; sprinkle with lemon juice, and shake the pan 
well so that liver and artichokes are impregnated with the 
seasonings and lemon juice. Serve on a hot dish. 

Here is an excellent way of serving pig's liver as prepared in 
Tuscany. There it is customary to serve the liver thus treated on 
a skewer, interspersed with small sections of toast, and bay 
leaves, but since grilling on a skewer is not the easiest way of 
cooking with modern appliances, omit the toast and the bay 
leaves, and having dipped your thin slices of pig's liver in 
beaten egg, dip them in the following mixture so that they are 
completely coated with it, and fry quickly in hot oil, then serve 
with sections of lemon. 



[ 144 ]-- 



MIXTURE FOR COATING 

A good handful of crisp breadcrumbs; a clove of garlic, crushed 
or cut very fine, a teaspoonful of fennel seeds, salt and pepper. 
Mix well together and when the liver has been dipped in beaten 
egg, coat with this mixture before frying in hot oil.

Woodcock 

These tender little birds need plucking very carefully, and the 
head, which is left on the body, is skinned. They are NOT 
drawn before cooking. 

Partly cook the woodcock in a stewpan with a little oil 
seasoned with salt, then cut in two, and remove the inside, 
throwing away the stomach and gall, but using the remainder 
to enrich the salmi, or sauce. Having removed the birds from 
the pan, heat a little butter, and in it brown a chopped onion 
and the insides removed from the birds and cut in small pieces ; 
replace the birds, adding a very little stock to prevent the 
birds drying; cover and cook until tender. Serve garnished 
with snippets of toast spread with the salmi.

BEGGAGGE ALLA ROMAGNOLA 

Another way with woodcock 

For this recipe, having plucked the bodies and skinned the 
heads, remove the insides. Throw away the stomach and the 
gall, and put the remaining insides in a mortar with a little 
butter, four thin slices of ham cut in small pieces, a little 
chopped parsley and a little soft breadcrumb that has been soaked 
in water or milk and squeezed dry. Pound to a paste, season 
with pepper and salt and stuff the birds with the mixture, 
tying with thread or fine string, and twisting the head round 
so that the beak can be used as a skewer through the thighs. 
Wrap a piece of thin fat pork around the breast, sprinkle with 
salt, wrap in buttered paper and cook gently in a moderate 
oven for about an hour; remove the paper, dip the birds in 
beaten white of egg, sprinkle with crisp breadcri:^bs and allow 
to cook for a further fifteen minutes so as to give them some 
colour. 

Remove from the oven, remove the string or thread and 
serve accompanied with piquant sauce (See 'SAUCES'). 
and sections of lemon. 



FAGIANO AL MADERA 

Pheasant cooked in Madeira

slices of fat bacon, and two slices of ham cut small, half an 
onion cut small, a stick of celery chopped fine, a teaspoonful 
of chopped parsley, a diced carrot and 1 ozs. butter, with 
pepper and salt and a dash of nutmeg. Cook together slowly 
until the pheasant begins to brown, then add a wineglassful 
of Madeira, and an equal quantity of stock ; cover the stewpan 
and allow the bird to finish cooking — about three quarters 
of an hour. Then place the bird in a hot dish, strain the fat 
from the sauce, pass through a sieve and pour over the bird, 
and send to the table, garnished with croutons of fried bread.

Vegetables 



Where vegetables are concerned, the Italian cook is con- 
siderably more imaginative than her English counter- 
part, and one is unlikely to be confronted with 'plain 
boiled' potatoes, or with watery vegetable marrow served with 
a thin white sauce ; try some of these suggestions for livening 
up the vegetable dishes.

cArciofi 

Artichokes 

Globe artichokes, a luxury in England, are one of Italy's 
staple vegetables. In Sicily one can pass acres and acres of land 
planted with these delicious vegetables; small wonder that 
they make frequent appearances on the Italian menu. 

To prepare them for cooking, remove th^^ outer leaves, cut 
off half of the top, or point of the artichoke, cut in halves and 
then in quarters, and allow to remain for about half an hour 
in water to which you have added a little lemon juice or vinegar. 
Drain and place in a saucepan with a little oil, a litde lemon 
juice, salt, pepper, a clove of garlic, crushed, and a pinch of 
origano, allow the artichokes to cook for fifteen minutes, turn- 
ing them frequently so that they become golden brown all 
over; remove to a hot dish and keep warm and to the sauce 
add one or two anchovies cut in small pieces, and cook together 
for a few minutes, then pour over the artichokes and serve hot. 



CARCIOFI IN FRICASSEA 

Fricassie of artichokes 

Prepare the artichokes by removing the outer leaves, and cut

an hour in water to which you have added a little lemon juice. 
Drain, and place in a saucepan with a little butter, chopped 
parsley, a clove of garlic crushed, and salt to taste. Allow to cook 
slowly for three quarters of an hour, then remove the pan from 
the heat, and add one or two egg yolks (depending on the quan- 
tity of artichokes) beaten lightly with a teaspoon of water per 
^gg yolk, the juice of half a lemon, and a tablespoonful of 
grated Parmesan cheese. Serve very hot.

MARROWS 

Whenever I am faced with a helping of boiled marrow, served 
in the English fashion, with white sauce, I think fondly of the 
more enterprising Italian ways of dealing with this vegetable. 
To our credit be it said that from the colossal ripe marrows 
of the late season we English can produce marrow pickle and 
marrow preserve that would bear comparison with any similar 
Continental delicacies, but what we do with early marrow is, to 
say the least, a trifle uninteresting. 

In the fruit and vegetables shops during the summer the tiny 
imported 'zucchini' are to be seen, and may be bought at 
luxury prices, but there is no reason why our English marrows 
should not be harvested while they are still young and tender 
and used in recipes for which 'zucchini' have been prescribed. 
Take for example some of the following : 



ZUCCHINE FRITTI 

Fried small marrows 

TO SERVE 4 

You need either a pound of zucchine, or a small English marrow 
of equal weight. Cut into rounds about f ths of an inch thick, 
spread on a plate, and cover with a sprinkling of salt. Place an 

-[ 177 ] 



inverted plate over them and leave for an hour, by the end of 
which time the liquid will have come out of them. Drain thor- 
oughly, then flour them and fry them in hot olive oil, allowing 
about a minute for each side. Drain them well before serving, so 
as to remove surplus oil, and serve with sections of lemon. 



STUFFED MARROW 

TO SERVE 4 

1 lb. small pepper and salt 

marrows and a pinch of rose- 
chopped ham mary mixed well 
breadcrumbs together 

Split the marrows in two lengthways, and remove the seeds. 
Fill the hollows with the stuffing, put the two halves of the 
marrows together again and tie with white cotton to keep the 
stuffing in. Heat a little butter in a stewpan, add the marrows, 
brown them lightly, then reduce the heat and cover the pan, and 
cook for a further twenty minutes. 



STEWED SMALL MARROWS 

TO SERVE 4 

1 lb. small marrows 3 good-sized onions 

3 tablespoons olive J pint water 

oil pepper and salt to 

taste 

Heat the oil and in it cook the chopped onion until it is golden 
brown. Add the marrows, unpeeled if you have the actual 
zucchine or supposing you are using English marrows these too 
may be unpeeled provided they are quite small, but if you are 
using the larger variety, then peel and cut into 1-inch slices; 
add water and seasoning; cover the pan and cook slowly for 
half an hour. 



[ 178 ] 



MARROW WITH TOMATO 

As a variation of the above dish, omit the water and add instead 
of it either two large tomatoes peeled and sliced, or a small tin 
of tomatoes, and if procurable, a teaspoonful of chopped basil, 
or failing this, a similar amount of chopped parsley. Keep an 
eye on the dish while cooking, and if it looks as though it is 
drying out, add a very Httle water from time to time. 

SPINACH 

Remember the need of washing spinach thoroughly; seven 
waters was at one time prescribed, and unless the spinach is 
phenomenally free from grit and sand, seven waters will not 
prove to be too many. To cook so as to retain as much as possible 
of the natural flavour, do not place the spinach in water, but 
after the last washing, lift it from the vessel with the hands, 
shake it well and place it in a saucepan large enough to hold 
the mass, without the addition of further water; sprinkle salt 
and cook over a low heat for ten or fifteen minutes, pressing it 
down from time to time with a fork to ensure even cooking.

Salads 



The salad most commonly met with in Italy is the fresh 
green salad, liberally doused with good olive oil and 
lemon juice, but there are a fair number of other salads 
to be met with when one spends a longer time in the country, 
and here are a few suggestions. 



♦ . 



[ 181 ] 



ONION SALAD 

Allow one large or two medium sized onions per person. 

Either bake the onions in the oven, or boil them until they 
are cooked but not mushy. Allow to cool and when cold, slice 
them fairly thinly, spread in layers on a flat dish and season 
with olive oil, lemon juice and pepper and salt. 



PLAIN SALAD 

Cos or Batavian lettuce, washed well and hung in a salad drain- 
er until crisp, is excellent by itself served with a plain oil and 
vinegar dressing, mixed well. (See 'DRESSING FOR GREEN 
SALAD'.) 



SALAD WITH HARD 
BOILED EGG 

Allow one hard boiled egg per person, cut in two lengthways 
and arrange on top of a bed of lettuce dressed as previously 
suggested with an oil and vinegar dressing; or if liked, serve 
individual plates of dressed lettuce, with egg, cut lengthways 
decorating each portion. 

With all green salads, remember not to add the dressing until 
the last possible moment before serving, and remember, too, 
that torn lettuce is preferable to lettuce cut with knife or scis- 
sors. 



CUCUMBER SALAD 

Slice thinly an unpeeled cucumber; spread the slices in a flat 
plate, sprinkle with salt, cover with another plate and leave 
for about two hours. Drain, and squeeze moisture out of the 
slices by placing in a cloth and squeezing in the hands. Season 
with oil, wine vinegar (or lemon juice), pepper and salt to taste, 
and, for additional enjoyment, a little castor sugar. 



■[ 182 ] 



MIXED SALAD 

Slice thinly a few gherkins, and a green pepper, add some 
cooked meat — ham, veal, pork or chicken for preference — cut 
in small pieces, a few cold boiled new potatoes, and if liked one 
or two anchovies, boned and cut small. Mix well together and 
serve with an oil and vinegar dressing. 



MIXED SALAD WITH HARD 
BOILED EGG 

Take three or four cold boiled potatoes (not floury ones), 
a beetroot cooked in the oven and cooled. Cut the vegetables 
into dice, and to them add two small gherkins, cut in thin slices. 
Combine these with a head of endive, washed carefully and 
torn into pieces. Mix well, and toss in an oil and vinegar dress- 
ing; sprinkle with capers, and decorate with three or four an- 
chovies, and one hard boiled egg per person, peeled and cut in 
two lengthways. 



INSALATA ALLA GIARDINIERA 

Gardener^s wife^s salad 

Mix together any left-over cooked young vegetables, small young 
potatoes, peas, beans, etc. together with peeled, sliced tomatoes, 
and serve with a dressing of oil and vinegar, pepper and salt. 



SALAD WITH SOUR CREAM 

When eggs are plentiful, hard-boil half a dozen, and having 
passed the yolks through a sieve, mix with half a cup or there- 
abouts of sour cream; add a pinch of salt, freshly-ground black 
pepper and two teaspoons or a little more of wine vinegar, and 
use as a salad dressing on a mixture of lettuce and sliced fresh 
cucumber.

Sweets 



Sweets met with on vacation in Italy seem to be of two 
kinds; either the welcome, well-filled dish of fruits in 
season, or the out-size very rich, very creamy 'layer cake', 
but a longer stay discloses other, more imaginative sweets, and 
a selection of these is given in the following pages. 



[ 184 ] 



ZABAGLIONE or ZABAIONE 

When talking of sweets in the Italian menu, this airy-fairy 
refinement of egg punch is the one that springs first to the mind, 
and it is worth while knowing how to make it to perfection. 

For each consumer allow 2 egg yolks, 2 tablespoons castor 
sugar, and 2 tablespoons of Marsala, or failing this, of good 
Sherry. Vanilla may be added, if liked, but for my taste the 
dish is better without it. 

Beat together the egg yolks and sugar until they are pale and 
creamy, then slowly add the Marsala. Place the mixture over 
hot water in a double boiler, and stir slowly until it thickens, 
taking care not to overcook it, otherwise it will curdle. Serve 
immediately in warmed sherbet glasses. There is a school of 
thought that dictates 'serve hot or cold', but this to most Italian 
palates is heresy — serve your zabaione hot. 



Fritters 

Starting off with a frying batter as a basis, delicious fritters may 
be made of the various fruits as they come into season. 



STANDARD FRYING BATTER 

4 ozs. plain flour 3 tablespoons olive 

a quarter of a pint oil 

or rather more of a pinch of salt 

warm water 1 lightly beaten egg 

white 

Sieve the flour into a basin, make a well in the centre and into 
this pour the oil ; mix \vell, and add the salt, then slowly add the 
water, stirring constantly until the consistency of thick cream 
is obtained. Allow to stand for 2 hours or thereabouts, then stir 
in the lightly beaten egg white, and use as a coating for fish 
or for fruits as suggested in the following pages. 

[ 185 ] _ 



APPLE FRITTERS 

For these use Bramleys or similar large cooking apples, allowing 
one per person. Peel the apples, and remove the core with a 
metal corer, then slice the apples transversely in slices about 
three-eighths of an inch in thickness, dip in batter, and fry in 
hot oil; drain, sprinkle with castor sugar and serve very hot. 

An improvement is to substitute for half the water of the 
batter, an equal amount of white wine. 

A refinement of these fritters also is to be obtained by immers- 
ing the apples, once they are peeled and cored, but before 
slicing them, in rum to which sugar and a pinch of cinnamon 
has been added, allowing them to remain for two or three 
hours, turning them frequently so as to impregnate the fruit 
with the rum, but in this case, the water batter is sufficiently 
rich without the addition of white wine. 



PEAR FRITTERS 

Using the same method, but instead of slicing the fruit, peel 
them, quarter them and core them before dipping in batter, 
hard cooking pears make delicious fritters. 



APRICOT FRITTERS 

For these the apricots should not be over-ripe. Gut in two, 
removing the stones ; place in a vessel deep enough to hold them 
when sprinkled with sugar; leave for several hours, or even for 
a whole day, then remove and drain, dip in frying batter and 
fry in hot oil, drain and serve, hot sprinkled with castor sugar. 
Alternatively, instead of covering with sugar and leaving for 
some hours, the apricots may be covered with rum, to which 
has been added sugar and a pinch of cinnamon, left for two or 
three hours, then drained, dipped in batter and fried. 



[ 186 ]. 



PEACH FRITTERS 

Peel the peaches, halve them and remove the stone. Immerse 
for several hours in white wine to which sugar has been added ; 
remove, drain, dip in frying batter and fry in hot olive oil. 



FIG FRITTERS 

For these you need fresh figs that are not overripe. Cut the 
fruit in two lengthways, and spread on a plate, sprinkling them 
with sugar and with a few drops of a good liqueur, Benedictine, 
Rosolio, or some similar liqueur. Leave for two or three hours, 
then drain, sprinkle lightly with flour, dip in frying batter, and 
fry in hot oil ; drain and serve hot, sprinkled with castor sugar. 



PLUM FRITTERS 

Again use fruit that is not over-ripe. Place in a warm oven for 
half an hour, then cut in halves, remove the stones, and spread 
on a dish, sprinkling with sugar and a few drops of rum and 
a pinch of cinnamon. Leave for two or three hours, then drain, 
dip in frying batter and fry as directed for the previous fruit 
fritters. 



SEMOLINA FRITTERS 

1 pint milk 4 tablespoons sugar 

pinch salt 4 ozs. semolina 

4 egg yolks 2 egg whites 

a little candied 2 ozs. raisins 
citron 

Heat the milk with the sugar and salt and when it begins to 
boil, place in the top of a double boiler, and add the semoUna 
little by little until a thick paste is formed, stirring continually 
so that it does not stick to the bottom of the saucepan; remove 

[ 187 ] 



from the heat, cool slightly and add the beaten egg yolks and 
later the whites beaten stiffly, the citron cut small and the rai- 
sins. Mix together well, and when cool, form into little balls the 
size of a walnut ; dip in beaten egg white and then in bread- 
crumbs and fry quickly in deep oil until a golden brown ; drain 
for a moment or two on blotting paper to drain off any surplus 
oil, and serve hot, sprinkled liberally with castor sugar. 



CHESTNUT FRITTERS 

To half a pound of chestnut flour, add sufficient water to make 
a thick paste ; add a pinch of salt, a few seedless raisins, and 
a few chopped pistachio nuts; mix together well and drop in 
spoonfuls into deep hot oil, cooking till golden brown. Drain and 
serve hot, sprinkled with castor sugar. 



FRITTELLE ALLA FIORENTINA 

To half a pound of fine flour add sufficient water to make 
a thick paste ; add a pinch of salt, the yolk of an egg, a little 
grated lemon rind and a few seedless raisins. Mix well and drop 
in spoonfuls into deep hot oil and fry until golden brown; 
Drain and serve hot. 




[ 188 ] 



SWEET FRITTERS 

2 egg yolks 2 ozs. flour 

1 pint cream a little finely 

2 tablespoons sugar chopped candied 

citron 

Beat together the egg yolks, cream and sugar until well mixed, 
blend in the flour and place in a double boiler, cooking till 
thick and being careful not to allow it to boil, otherwise the 
tgg yolks will curdle. If the cream does not seem to be thick 
enough, a little semolina may be added towards the end of 
the cooking time. Stir in the citron. 

Pour on to a flat plate that has been lightly oiled or greased 
with butter; allow to cool, cut in pieces about two inches 
square; dip in wliite of tgg and then in breadcrumbs, fry in 
butter till golden brown, serve hot, sprinkled with sugar. 



MONT BLANC 

THIS SHOULD SERVE 4 

1 lb. Italian chestnuts J lb. castor sugar 

J pint double cream 

Cut a slit in the chestnuts at the pointed end, and place them 
a dozen at a time in a very hot oven for ten minutes, after 
which they will peel easily. When all are peeled, place in boiling 
water and allow to simmer for an hour or until they are tender. 
Strain, and mash the nuts, adding the sugar and a pinch of 
salt. Pass them then through a potato ricer, allowing them to 
pile up in pyramid form on a dish. The less you touch them with 
your hands the better, otherwise the light appearance of the 
finished dish is apt to be spoiled. 

Whip the cream, flavouring it if you like with a little good 
liqueur, and pile it lightly on the top of the mound of chestnuts, 
rather like snow on a mountain top. 



[ 189 ]. 



CHARLOTTE DI MELE, PERE 
O PESCHE 

Apple, pear or peach charlotte 

TO SERVE 6 



2 lbs. cooking apples, 
pears or peaches 
that are not over- 
ripe 

grated rind of a 
lemon 

1 wineglassful rum 

4 ozs. brown sugar 



1 tablespoon cold 

water 
1 oz. butter 
1 wineglassful white 

wine 
thin slices of bread 

and butter with 

crusts removed 



Prepare the fruit by peeling and coring (or in the case of pea- 
ches, removing the stones), put them in a stewpan with the 
sugar, the water and the white rind and cook until tender; when 
the fruit is reduced to a pulp, add the butter and the grated 
lemon rind, and if not sufficiently sweet add a little more sugar. 
Meanwhile, grease a souffle mould, and line it entirely with 
well-buttered slices of thin bread. Pour in the fruit pulp, and 
over the top place a layer of thinly sliced and buttered bread. 
Sprinkle with sugar. Bake in a moderate oven for half an hour, 
and just before serving, pour over the rum and light, so that the 
dish is carried flaming to the table. This final touch may be 
omitted if preferred.

BODINO DI LATTE ALLA 
MANDORLE 

Milk pudding with almonds 

TO SERVE 4 

For those who like almonds, here is a refinement of milk pud- 
ding that is worthy of attention. 

1 pint milk 4 to 5 ozs. castor 

2 ozs. almonds sugar, depending 
2 slices of bread with on personal taste 

crust removed, 6 whole eggs and 
soaked in milk two extra yolks 

and squeezed dry a little candied 
butter for greasing citron 

a souffle dish 

Blanch the almonds in boiling water and remove the skins, 
then in a mortar pound them to a paste, uniting them with the 
soaked and squeezed bread. Meanwhile heat the milk in a dou- 
ble boiler, with the sugar added ; when the milk reaches boiling 
point, add the paste of almonds and bread, little by little, and 
cook a few minutes longer, stirring so that it does not stick to the 
bottom of the pan. Remove from the fire and slowly add the 
beaten eggs and extra yolks, mixing well. Meanwhile, grease 
your souffle dish, and pour in the milk mixture, and cook for an 
hour in an oven that is not too fierce (the heat you use for rice 
pudding should be right for this). 

Serve hot, and if you wish to make it even more luxurious, 
prepare a zabaglione, and serve at the same time. 



BODINO DI GABINETTO 

Cabinet pudding 

TO SERVE 4 

Sufficient stale Savoy fingers to line your souffle mould, which 
should be the pint-and-a-half size 



[ 191 ] 



J lb. ratafia biscuits f pint milk 

2 whole eggs and 1 tablespoonful 

2 extra yolks castor sugar 

grated rind of half a tablespoonful each 

a lemon of sultanas and of 

a few glace cherries chopped citron 
and a little shred- 
ded angelica 

Grease your souffle dish with butter, and line the sides with 
stale Savoy biscuits — or failing these, stale sponge cakes cut 
in thin slices lengthways ; arrange at the bottom of the mould 
a layer of the sultanas, mixed with the chopped citron, cherries 
and angelica, and on this place the ratafias broken small and 
any trimmings left over from the Savoy biscuits or sponge 
cakes. 

Beat together the eggs, extra yolks and sugar, and when the 
sugar is dissolved, beat in the milk slowly, and strain into the 
mould. 

You may now either cover with buttered paper and steam 
gently for an hour, or place in a not too fierce oven and bake 
for a similar length of time. 

Serve with whipped cream, or with a little apricot jam 
warmed. 



CREMA DI BAGNOMARIA 

Rich steamed custard 

TO SERVE 6 

2 eggs, plus 4 3 tablespoonsful 

extra egg yolks castor sugar 

\ pint milk grated rind of half 

butter for greasing ' a lemon — alterna- 

dish tively, a teaspoon 

of vanilla 

Grate the lemon rind into the milk, or alternatively add the 
vanilla and allow it to stand for half an hour. Break the eggs 
and extra yolks into a basin, and beat together with the sugar, 
then add the milk gradually. When thoroughly mixed, pass 
through a fine sieve, removing all the froth that has formed in 
the beating. Place the liquid in a greased souffle dish and place 

[ 192 ] ^ 



this in a double-boiler, or if one is not available, place it on an 
inverted sandwich cake tin, in a saucepan of boiling water, 
with the water reaching to within 1 ^ inches from the top of the 
outside of the souffle dish. Cook on top of the stove, keeping the 
water just under boiling point for about an hour. If you propose 
eating this dish hot, allow to stand for about ten minutes after 
it has finished cooking, before serving. Alternatively it may be 
allowed to become cold, when it makes a delicious cold sweet. 



CROSTINI ALL'ANANASSO 

Pineapple toast 

TO SERVE 4 

This is a dish worth trying when South African pineapples 
are available at reasonable prices. 

1 or 2 of these 1 2 thin slices of 

small pineapples bread with the 

4 ozs. butter crusts removed, 

a few teaspoonsful of and cut in two 

maraschino or lengthways 

kirsch a little apricot jam 

4 ozs. sugar \ wineglassful of 

water 

Heat the butter in a heavy pan and in it fry the bread very 
lightly, not so much browning it as allowing it to absorb the 
butter. Previously, peel the pineapples and cut into as many 
sHces as there are pieces of bread, lay these in a plate, sprinkle 
lightly with sugar and with the liqueur and allow it to stay for 
two or three hours. When the pineapple has 'marinated' and the 
bread is cooked, arrange in a flat fireproof dish, with a piece of 
pineapple on each piece of bread. 

Cook the sugar with the water until it begins to colour, and to 
this add the liquid in which the pineapple has marinated, to- 
gether with the apricot jam ; boil together for a few minutes, 
then pass through a sieve and serve boiling hot over the 
'crostini'. 



[ 193 ] 



MERINGUES 

Since so many of the foregoing recipes call for 'extra yolks' 
a recipe for meringues is useful for employing the whites left 
over. 

Light the oven before starting to make the meringues, and it 
should be a very slow oven (250 degrees at most). 

4 egg whites 1 cup castor sugar 

a pinch of salt | teaspoon vanilla, if 

liked 

Beat the egg whites with a beater, together with the pinch of 
salt until they are stiff and dry; now add half the sugar a little at 
a time, beating thoroughly after each addition; beat in the 
vanilla ; the balance of the sugar should be folded in with a spa- 
tula or fork. 

Meanwhile run some sheets of brown paper under the cold 
water tap and use as linings for flat 'cookie' tins. Drop the egg 
mixture by large spoonfuls on to the paper, place them in the 
oven and allow to cook for 45 to 60 minutes, or until they will 
lift easily from the paper. The slow cooking is essential, the 
trick being to dry out the mixture rather than to cook it. 
'^i When cooled, serve filled with ice cream, whipped cream, or 
any sweetened fruit. 



PASTICCIO DI FRUTTA 

Fruit flan 

Prepare two pounds of mixed fruit in season, apples, apricots, 
plums, pears, etc. and place to cook in a stewpanwith4 ozs. gran- 
ulated sugar and a wineglassful of white wine. A few soaked 
and stoned prunes make a welcome addition to the mixture. 
When the fruit is tender, add a little chopped candied citron, 
a couple of tablespoons of rum and a pinch of powdered cin- 
namon. 

Meanwhile line flan tins with fairly rich pastry; pour in the 
fruit and bake in a hot oven until the pastry is cooked. 

Serve hot or cold, with whipped cream. 

• 
[ 194 ] 



SFOGLIATA DOLCE DI 
RICOTTA 

Sfogliate are little *bonnes-bouches' of the lightest of light puff 
paste, filled with various fillings; a good number are filled, as 
are our vol-au-vents, with minced chicken, shrimps and other 
savoury fillings; here is one in which ricotta cheese is suggested, 
but which can be made here with the substitution of cream 
cheese for the unobtainable ricotta. 

Prepare a supply of puff pastry made of equal quantities 
(say 4 ozs. each) of flour and butter. 

For the filling: 

J lb. cream cheese 1 tablespoonful 

1 tablespoonful candied orange 

sultanas peel 

1 teaspoonful rum a few drops of va- 
J lb. castor sugar nilla 

For the cream: 

1 Q^gg yolk \ tablespoonful 

1 oz. flour sugar 

1 wineglassful milk 

Beat egg and sugar for coating the sfogliate before baking. Half 
an hour before starting to cook, place the chopped orange 
peel and the sultanas in a cup with the rum, and allow them to 
absorb it before adding them to the mixture of cream cheese and 
sugar. 

Combine the Ggg yolk, sugar and flour, gently add the milk 
and cook together in a double boiler till it has thickened; mix 
with the cheese mixture. 

Divide the puff pastry into squares about 3 inches on each 
side ; brush with beaten &gg ; in the centre of each plate a tea- 
spoonful of the filling, and fold the pastry over comerways, press- 
ing the edges together ; brush the top with beaten ^gg, and bake 
in a hot oven for twenty minutes ; five minutes before finishing 
cooking, remove from the oven and sprinkle liberally with castor 
sugar, which will caramelise slightly, when the sfogliate are 
returned to the heat. 



[ 195 ] 



PIZZA 

A book of Italian cookery would be incomplete without one or 
two recipes for this Neapolitan speciality — try it if you like ; 
speaking for myself, the mention of pizza will always recall 
what arrived at my table in Naples one evening when, fancying 
'something not too heavy', I ordered pizza. I waited a few 
moments and was then confronted with an outsize dinner plate, 
on which reposed something that looked rather like King Henry 
the Eighth's best hat made of pastry that was solid rather than 
light, and filled with a mixture of tomatoes and anchovies that, 
to say the least, was rich, and alarmingly salty. However, if it's 
pizza you fancy, here's how it is made. 



PIZZA ALLA CAMPOFRANCO 

TO SERVE 8 

J lb. plain flour 1 teaspoon chopped 

5 eggs basil 

half tablespoon J oz. brewers' yeast 

sugar J lb. Bel Paese cheese 

J lb. ham 1 lb. tomatoes 

3 tablespoons grated 1 tablespoon olive 

Parmesan oil 

. 5 ozs. butter pepper 

Pile the flour on to your pastry board or cooking table, make 
a hollow in it and in this put the butter, two eggs, a pinch of salt 
and the yeast diluted with a little water or milk. Work the flour 
with the hands until the ingredients are absorbed, then blend in 
the next two eggs, and work the dough until it is elastic to the 
touch; then add the sugar; work the dough a little more; then 
place in a warmed basin. Cover with a cloth and leave in a fairly 
warm place for a couple of hours, by which time it should have 
doubled in size. 

Meanwhile prepare the filling; slice the cheese, and the ham; 
peel the tomatoes and remove the seeds, and cook very quickly 
in oil so that they do not become mushy but retain their firm- 
ness. 



[ 196 ] 



When the dough has risen, flour your pastry board; divide 
the dough in two pieces, one sHghtly larger than the other and 
roll out into two circles. With the larger one, line a greased pie 
plate or flan tin, and on it lay first of all a layer of the cheese, 
then a layer of the cooked tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper 
and a little basil, and on this place a layer of strips of ham ; 
continue in this way till the filling is all used up, and finish oflf 
with a layer of the grated Parmesan. Now beat the fifth egg, 
and with a brush paint the edges of the dough, and over it place 
the smaller circle of dough, pressing the edges together so that 
they remain closed; leave it to rise again in a warm place, for 
about an hour, then paint the top with the balance of the beaten 
egg, and cook for twenty to twenty five minutes in a hot oven. 
Eat hot. 



■[ 197 ] 



Sauces 



The preparation of a sauce is a ritual in Italy; it is not 
unusual for an Italian housewife to spend hours in loving 
preparation of a truly rich and enjoyable sauce to be 
eaten over *pasta', and having tasted the results of some of the 
hours of loving labour, one has to admit the time has been well- 
spent. 



[ 198 ] 



BECHAMEL SAUCE 

IJ ounces butter 2 tablespoons 

1 pint heated milk flour 

salt and pepper 

Allow butter to melt in saucepan, but before it turns brown 
lower heat, and blend in flour, stirring until smooth; then little 
by little add heated milk, stirring constantly. If liked add a pinch 
of nutmeg when adding the seasonings, or alternatively allow 
a bay leaf to remain in the sauce during its final cooking, 
which should be fifteen minutes from the time the milk, flour 
and butter are blended together. It is a good idea to use the 
top of a double boiler for making this sauce, placing it over 
the boiling water in the lower part of the boiler for the last 
fifteen minutes of cooking time. If it is too thick, add a little 
more milk from time to time. 

If you have used a bay leaf for flavouring, remove before 
serving. 

If the sauce is made well in advance, cover with a lid to 
prevent a skin forming. 



VARIATIONS OF BECHAMEL 
SAUCE 

Cheese Sauce 

Make sauce as directed for plain Bechamel sauce, and when 
cooked, add six to eight tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 
and blend well before serving, 
f ^Excellent over cooked broccoli or cauliflower.^ 



Egg and Parsley Sauce 

To 1 pint of Bechamel sauce made as directed, allow two hard 
boiled eggs and three tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley, 
stir in just before serving. A variation is to add also a teaspoon- 
ful of finely chopped mint. 

Excellent with broccoli, cauliflower or fish dishes. 

[ 199 ] 



Mushroom Sauce 

While your Bechamel sauce is cooking, wash and chop finely 
J lb. mushrooms and cook gently for ten minutes in hot olive 
oil before adding to the Bechamel. 



Shrimp Sauce 

To a pint of Bechamel sauce add half a pint of shrimps, shelled 
and chopped, and serve when heated through. 
A good sauce with fish. 



BROWN SAUCE 



1 small onion 

chopped finely 

2 tablespoons 
chopped parsley 

1 pint beef stock 
4 tablespoons flour 
1 bay leaf 



3 tablespoons olive 

oil 
freshly ground 

black pepper 
1 teaspoon oregano, 

or, failing this, 

J teaspoon thyme 



Heat oil in heavy pan, brown onion in this, with parsley, and 
stir in flour. When brown and blended add slowly your beef 
stock; allow to boil for two or three minutes, and add season- 
ings. 



VARIATIONS OF BROWN SAUCE 

Mushroom Sauce 

To half a pint of brown sauce made as above, add quarter of 
a pound of mushrooms that have been washed, chopped finely 
and cooked for five minutes in hot olive oil. Delicious with 
steak and baked meats. 



[ 200 ] 



White Wine Sauce 

To half a pint of brown sauce add a quarter of a pint of white 
wine; heat together to boiling point and serve immediately. 
A good sauce with baked meat. 



PARSLEY BUTTER 

1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon finely 

1 teaspoon lemon minced parsley 

juice pinch salt 

Steak is greatly enhanced with little dabs of this simple sauce. 
Cream butter and blend in remaining ingredients, mixing 
well and allowing to become very cold before serving at table 
with steak. 

Variations 
of Parsley Butter 

Instead of a tablespoon of parsley, try the combination of 
a teaspoonful each of mint, parsley and sweet basil, chopped 
finely, or alternatively, two teaspoons parsley to one of mint, 
or two teaspoons parsley to one of basil. 



ALMOND SAUCE 

2 tablespoons butter 2 ozs. blanched 

juice of two lemons chopped almonds

«SOFFRITTO' OR 'BATTUTO' 

This is the name given to the foundation from which stews and 
soups are often started ; in its simplest form it consists of hot oil, 
butter or dripping, in which has been browned a chopped 
onion or a clove of garlic crushed, but it can be elaborated 
by the addition of chopped carrot, parsley and celery, but all 
very finely chopped and browned before the addition of the 
meat or game which is to form the stew or soup. 



SIMPLE TOMATO SAUCE 



1 medium size tin

Heat oil in a heavy pan, fry onion until transparent and pale 
yellow, add parsley or basil. Strain tomatoes and add. Cook

[ 202 ] 



UNSWEETENED TOMATO SAUCE 

This sauce, which uses the tomato puree instead of the tinned 
tomatoes, needs slightly longer cooking to ensure that the too 
sharp flavour of the concentrated puree is somewhat diluted. 

2 tablespoons 3 tablespoons olive 

tomato puree oil 

1 clove garlic, 2 good-sized onions, 

crushed sliced 

} teaspoon oregano, 1 pint water 

or failing this, salt and pepper 

J teaspoon th^Tne to taste 

Heat oil and in it fry onion gently, until transparent and yellow- 
coloured; add puree, and cook together two or three minutes, 
stirring constantly. Add seasonings and water, cover and cook 
slowly for an hour or slightly more, stirring from time to time 
and adding more water if it becomes too thick. Serve very hot. 



TOMATO SAUCE ALLA 
NAPOLITANA 

SUFFICIENT FOR SPAGHETTI FOR 4 

1 lb. tomatoes 1 onion 

2 stalks celery 1 carrot 

a lew leaves of fresh pepper and salt to 

basil taste 

Wash tomatoes, cut in pieces and place in saucepan with other 
vegetables cut coarsely. Allow to cook slowly for half an hour 
or until the vegetables are tender. Remove from fire and pass 
through a sieve. Season with pepper and salt. Usually in Naples 
a knob of fresh lard is added at the end of the cooking and mixed 
well with the sauce, and just before serving a little freshly 
chopped basil makes an excellent finishing touch. 



TOMATO SAUCE — TO ENRICH 

Try the addition of a slice of ham, finely chopped, and/or 
a glass of Marsala to the finished sauce.

SALSA OLANDESE j 

Hollandaise Sauce \ 

juice of half 2 unbeaten tgg 1 

a lemon yolks \ 

J lb. butter J teaspoon salt \ 

a dash of cayenne \ 



An excellent sauce to serve with artichokes or asparagus. 

Add lemon juice to unbeaten ^gg yolks. Divide butter into 
three and add one-third also to &gg yolks. Cook over hot, but 
not boiling, water, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon 
until the butter has melted and the sauce has thickened. Add 
the second third of the butter and continue stirring until it has 
melted and the sauce has thickened again; repeat the process 
with the remaining third of the butter, and continue stirring 
until the sauce has the consistency of mayonnaise. Add the 
seasonings and beat sauce with a wire whip until it takes on 
a shiny appearance — about half a minute's beating will be 
needed. It should not curdle, but if it should, beat in a little 
boiling water until it is smooth.

TUNNY FISH SAUCE 

FOR 1 POUND OF SPAGHETTI 

1 — 6 ozs. tin tunny 1 lb. (or 1 me- 
fish dium sized tin) 

3 tablespoons tomatoes 

chopped parsley 3 anchovies 

1 tablespoon 3 tablespoons olive oil 

chopped capers 1 clove garlic 

salt and pepper crushed 

Heat the oil and in it allow the capers and crushed garlic 
to cook a few minutes, but do not brown; add tomatoes (cut 
up, skinned and seeded if raw — strained through a sieve if 
tinned), and cook for a further half hour. Flake tunny fish 
small, and chop anchovies finely and add to the tomato sauce, 
together with salt and pepper. Cook uncovered until it has 
become thick. 



CLAM SAUCE 

Substituting a medium sized tin of clams (drained) for the 
tunny fish and anchovies of the preceding recipe you have 
a favourite sauce for spaghetti frequently met with in and around 
Naples, except that there the clams come direct out of the sea 
and not out of tins. 



SHRIMP SAUCE 

1 pint (before 2 tablespoons 

shellings) shrimps olive oil 

or prawns 1 small onion 

1 tablespoon 
chopped parsley 

Chop onion and cook without browning in the heated oil, 
adding a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, and the shelled 
shrimps, together with warm water to cover and simmer 
20 minutes. The addition of a few finely chopped toasted al- 
monds is interesting.

parsley

but do not allow it to brown. Add peeled and cut up tomatoes, 
pepper and salt and cook fairly fast until tomatoes are cooked 
through but not reduced to a pulp. Add a good tablespoonful 
of oregano, basil or parsley, and before serving add another 
clove of garlic cut very, very fine. 

Tinned tomatoes may be used if fresh are not available, 
but for this sauce the fresh are infinitely preferable. 

An excellent sauce to serve with beefsteak.

fresh bread crumb may be substituted for the boiled potato.

PESTO 

FOR 2 PEOPLE 



Pesto is a sauce of Genoese origin that finds its ways into many 
dishes; it is excellent with spaghetti, for instance, and a table- 
spoon added to minestrone greatly enhances the flavour. Any 
left-over pesto may be placed in a small jar, covered with 
olive oil and kept for some days. 



3 cloves garlic 
sufficient fresh basil 


1 cup grated Sardo 
cheese, but since

Pound the garlic and basil to a paste in a mortar, add the cheese 
and continue pounding until a thick paste results, then slowly 
add oil until you have a mixture the consistency of mayon- 
naise. 

A few almonds, pine nuts or even walnuts pounded into 
the paste make an interesting variation. 



[ 208 ] 



RAGU BOLOGNESE 

SUFFICIENT FOR 6 

No book on Italian cookery would be complete without a recipe 
for this, one of Italy's most famous sauces. J lb. lean beef, 
or a mixture of beef with veal and or pork, though the beef 
should predominate, and all should be passed through a mincer 
twice. 

IJ ozs. butter 1 J cups stock or 
3 ozs. streaky water, or for 

bacon preference 1 cup 

onion, carrot, stock plus J cup 

a stick of celery, white wine 

a crushed clove 1 teaspoon tomato 

garlic paste 

2 or 3 cloves i cup cream 

or a pinch of salt and pepper 

powdered cloves to taste 

A few chopped mushrooms may be added if liked, and if you 
have three or four chicken livers available, these, chopped, are 
a great improvement. 

Having minced the meat, place in a stewpan with the heated 
butter, add chopped bacon, onion, carrot and celery, all of 
which can, to save time, have been passed through the mincer. 
Add two or three dried cloves or a pinch of powered cloves, 
and allow to cook until the meat has browned and the vegetables 
are a golden colour. Add the stock and/or wine little by little, 
add tomato paste moistened with a little stock, stir well; add 
salt and pepper. Cover meat with the liquid, lower heat and 
allow the mixture to cook gently for another 15 minutes. 
In one of the traditional recipes milk is used instead of stock, 
which results in a richer-tasting sauce, but this is purely a matter 
of personal preference. 

At the end of the cooking time add the cream and mix well. 

Excellent sauce for serving with spaghetti. 



[ 209 ]- 



LIVER SAUCE FOR GNOGGHI 



J lb. liver,

MAYONNAISE 

Legend has it that a certain Duke of Mayenne, a great gourmet, 
was so busy discussing with the camp chef the preparation 
of a special sauce to grace a cold chicken that by the time 
the discussion had come to an end, his own cavalry had been 
overcome by those of the enemy, and the Battle of Arques was 
lost for his side. So much for history; the Duke deserves an 
honourable mention, for the sauce that caused the trouble 
was the forerunner of Mayonnaise, and took its name from 
the unfortunate gentleman who had a hand in its creation. 
For a good mayonnaise you will need : 

1 J cups good 3 egg yolks 

olive oil about 3 teaspoons 

a pinch of salt lemon juice or 

wine vinegar 

Place the egg yolks and a pinch of salt in a bowl and with 
a wooden spoon or a metal egg whisk beat them slowly, slowly 
until thick, and then start adding your olive oil, literally drop 
by drop. After two or three tablespoonsful have added, the 
mayonnaise may be a trifle too thick, in which case beat in 
a little lemon juice or wine vinegar. Continue beating and 
adding oil slowly until the desired consistency is obtained. 



[ 211 ] 



SALSA REMOULADE 

To a mayonnaise made as in the foregoing recipe add the follow- 
ing: 

1 tablespoonful 1 tablespoonful 
made mustard — finely chopped 
or to taste parsley 

2 tablespoonfuls 2 or 3 chopped 
finely chopped gherkins 
capers 

Excellent to serve with cold meat or with shellfish. 



DRESSING FOR GREEN SALAD 

SUFFICIENT FOR SALAD FOR 4 

J teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon castor 

1 teaspoon French sugar 

mustard freshly ground 

1 tablespoon wine black pepper 

vinegar 3 tablespoons olive 

oil 

Mix together all ingredients except the oil, then slowly add 
the oil, and mix till well blended. An excellent mixer is of the 
type sold for mixing such drinks as Horlicks or Ovaltine. The 
mixing time is two or three minutes, and the dressing is all 
the better if it is made an hour in advance of the meal at which 
it is to be used. Once blended it can be embellished by the addi- 
tion of a teaspoonful or more of finely chopped parsley, mint 
or basil, and by half a clove of garlic very finely chopped, if 
liked. DO NOT ADD TO YOUR SALAD UNTIL A MO- 
MENT OR TWO BEFORE SERVING.
