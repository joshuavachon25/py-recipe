Roasting — Meats, Poultry 



Meats, Fish, Poultry and Soup 

A (?Imple cooking Time Table for "automatic" cooking in the fireless-cooking oven. 

We recommend that all meats be roasted 
in an ■wncovered roasting pan. In prepar- 
ing all roasts, remove excess fat and dredge with flour and salt; if salt alone is used too much 
jr.ice will run before roast is browned. In roasting a small piece of meat (3 lbs. or less) we recom- 
n.or.d using a small pan instead of a large roasting pan. Do not use any water with roasts.

General Rule 



For all meat, poultry or fish dishes not given in this Time 
Table, follow this general rule: 



Direct Heat 



Retained Heat 



10 minutes per pound up to 5 lbs. \ , f 15 minutes per pound up to 4 lbs. 

5 minutes more for each additional lb. / *^ \ 10 minutes more for each additional lb. 



Two extra dishes can be cooked at the same time, making three dishes in all. 
over three, add five minutes direct heat, but no extra retained heat. 



For each dish 



When cooking two or more vegetables or fruits together without any 
meat dish, use the time of the longest-cooking vegetable. Three 
vessels can be cooked on this time. If more than three vessels are used, add five minutes for 
each vessel over three. Start all vegetables and fruits in COLD water in COLD oven.

Before Using Oven for First Time 

Before using the Sentinel Oven for the first time for cooking, 
light the oven burner and allow the Thermostone to bake for 30 
minutes. (Follow instructions for lighting.) This is necessary 
only once — before the stove is used for the very first time. 
It is done to remove the moisture from the new soapstones. 
Some fumes will be given off while the stones are drying. 




Directions for Setting Cooking Clock 
and Lighting Gas 

These pictures illustrate the Hghting of the Cabinet Model. The other models are lighted in just the 
same way, the only difference being that on the other models the Cooking Clock is on the side instead of 
down under the oven.

extending out from under Thermostone. Hold match there until gas is lighted. In case 
match should go out, turn gas off until new match is lighted and ready to use. Be sure 
oven burner is lighted, then close door gently.

What the Sentinel Stove Can Mean to You 



The Sentinel Automatic Cook Stove 
is a gas range with a built-in fireless- 
cooking oven. 

If you use it properly it will save you 
from one to four hours every day by re- 
lieving you of "pot watching." No need 
to stay around the kitchen to add water, 
or stir or baste. No need even to shut 
off the gas! 

The Sentinel stove cooks automat- 
ically. You may put an entire meal — 
soup, meat, vegetables and perhaps a 
pudding — into the fireless-cooking oven 
all at the same time. No need to pre- 
heat the food or the oven. Start the 
whole meal at once, COLD, in a COLD 
OVEN. 



You simply set the Dial Hand of the 
Cooking Clock for the number of min- 
utes Direct Heat required for the meal, 
and then you are free until meal-time. 
You can go shopping or calling, read, 
write, take a nap, or get out of doors. 
At the proper time the Coolking Clock 
will shut off the gas automatically, and 
then the Thermostone in the bottom of 
the oven will begin to give off the heat it 
has been storing up, and your dinner 
will finish cooking on this gentle Re- 
tained Heat, which costs you nothing. 

When meal-time comes, you simply 
slip on an apron, open the oven door 
and take up the meal, thoroughly done, 
steaming hot, and full of juice and flavor. 



How to Use the Time Tables 



"But how am I to knoiv how long to set 
the Cooking Clock for, and how much Re- 
tained Heat to allow?" you ask. 

We have prepared simple but very 
complete Time Tables to guide you and 
make it easy for you to use the Sentinel 
Stove. We believe that never before 
has a stove manufacturer published such 
a complete and helpful book of direc- 
tions to aid women to get the best re- 
sults from their stoves. 

To make it perfectly clear just what 
we mean by "Direct Heat" and "Re- 
tained Heat," and just how to set the 
Cooking Clock according to the Time 
Table, we will work out a sample dinner. 

Sample Automatic Dinner 

Tomato Soup 

Roast Pork (6 lbs.) Baked Potatoes 

Apple Sauce 

Boiled Onions Cauliflower 

Newton Tapioca 
The above menu, giving a complete 
dinner for six servings, should all be 
placed in the oven at the same time. 
Prepare the seven dishes according to 
the following recipes: 

Tomato Soup 
5 can tomatoes 2 c. water 
2 tbsp. butter i c. flour 
1 tsp. salt Pepper 

1 sUce of onion 1 slice of turnip 

Melt butter, stir in the flour, add all 
ingredients. Place in covered utensil. 

Roast Pork 
Dredge the pork with flour and salt, 
and place in a roaster or other utensil. 
Do not use any water. Do not cover. 
Baked Potatoes 
Wash potatoes and place on rack or 
in a pan. (If you will brush potatoes 
with melted butter first, you will be 
delighted with their creaminess.) 

Apple Sauce 
8 tart apples 1 c. sugar 

1 c. water 1 slice of lemon 

Use cold water and prepare in covered 
utensil. Use very little water. 



Buttered Cauliflower 
Break the cauliflower into small 
flowerets, cover with cold salted water 
in a covered utensil. 

Boiled Onions 
Peel onions, cover with cold salted 
water in a covered utensil. 

Newton Tapioca 
5 c. pearl tapioca 5 c. milk 
§ c. Indian meal f c. molasses 
1 tsp. salt i c. butter 

Soak tapioca in water at least 3 hours 
(over night if convenient.) Scald 4 cups 
of milk and pour this over the Indian 
meal and cook 15 minutes. Drain the 
tapioca and combine all. Put in covered 
utensil. 

The time to use in setting the Cooking 
Clock is determined by the time of the 
longest cooking dish — generally the 
meat. In this case it is the pork. 

According to our roasting time table 
it is recommended that a 6-pound piece 
of pork be given 55 minutes "Direct 
Heat." This fifty-five minutes will 
heat three dishes of food as readily as 
one. For each dish over three, as ex- 
plained in the "Note" at the side of the 
Time Table, add five minutes of direct 
heat, that is, five minutes each should 
be added for the fourth, fifth and sixth 
utensils, or fifteen minutes extra, mak- 
ing seventy minutes (or one hour and 
ten minutes) total Direct Heati 

The number of minutes Retained 
Heat for a 6-pound piece of pork ac- 
cording to the Time Table is one hour 
and 20 minutes. Therefore, you would 
set the Dial Hand of the Cooking Clock 
for one hour and ten minutes of gas. 
At the end of this time the gas will shut 
off automatically. Then allow the 
dinner to stay in the oven one hour and 
20 minutes longer on Retained Heat 
(after the gas is shut off), making a 
total cooking time of two hours and 30 
minutes. 



Page 6 



How to Use Time Tables 



Suppose you wanted to serve this 
dinner at 6 o'clock. The entire dinner 
would be prepared at one time and put 
into the oven, cold, at half past three. 
It would cook on Direct Heat until 
twenty minutes of five. Then the gas 
would be turned off automatically by 
the Cooking Clock and the dinner 
would cook from then until 6 o'clock on 
Retained Heat. 

"But," you say, "suppose I want to go 
out at 2 o'clock? Must I wait until half 
past three to put in my dinner?" 

No. You can put in your dinner be- 
fore two o'clock if you wish. Set the 



Cooking Clock for one hour and 10 
minutes just the same and light the gas. 
The dinner can stay in the oven almost 
indefinitely on the Retained Heat with- 
out injury, because this Retained Heat 
is so gentle that it will not dry out the 
roa.st or boil the vegetables dry. Even 
after being in the oven all afternoon 
you will find your dinner full of juice 
and flavor. 

If you should be detained so late that 
your dinner was not steaming hot upon 
your return, you would need only to 
light the oven burner for ten minutes 
and everything would soon be good and 
hot. 



General Suggestions 



To use oven as ordinary gas range 
oven, set Dial Hand of Cooking Clock 
as far as it will go. This will allow for 
one hour and 30 minutes gas. When 
you are through cooking, simply turn 
Dial Hand back to aero and gas will 
shut off. 

In preparing food for automatic cook- 
ing your usual methods can be em- 
ployed with the few simple exceptions 
which follow: 

When boiling or stewing vegetables 
and fruit, start in cold water and always 
use tightly covered vessels. Use less 
water than you ordinarily would, ex- 
cepting with spinach. 

Escalloped dishes and most puddings 
should not be covered if they are to 
brown. 

In roasting meats or fowls, place in 
uncovered roasting pan. Do not use 
water. Place small strips of fat under 
meat or fowl to keep from sticking to 
bottom, if it seems necessary. 

Different people use different baking 
pans and have such different ideas on 
baking, as to when pies or cakes or 
bread are done, and just how brown they 
should be, that it is difficult to give any 
hard and fast rules. We can only give 
times as worked out in our Cooking 
Laboratory. By using these times as a 
guide you can soon learn how to vary 
them to suit your own requirements. 

When oven is not in use, always leave 
the door ajar to allow for a free circula- 
tion of air. This will keep your oven 
dry and sweet and guard against the 
possibility of rust forming. 



All methods of cooking can be done 
automatically in the oven except broiling 
and frying. Boiling — including steam- 
ing, stewing and simmering; roasting — • 
including braising or pot-roasting; bak- 
ing which does not expand or swell; are 
all better and more economically cooked 
automatically in the oven than over the 
open burners, and all three methods can 
be carried on together. In cases of this 
character the times used are those which 
would be used for the longest cooking 
article. 

In cooking meat loaf, pot pies, etc., 
if no time is given in the Time Table, 
allow 35 or 40 minutes, according to 
the nature of the dish and the size. 

If by any chance the clock gets out 
of order or needs any attention, it may 
be taken off very easily by unscrewing 
the two screws which hold the "ears" 
at the back of the clock case, near the 
top. Return the clock by express ad- 
dressed to The Sentinel Manufacturing 
Company, New Haven, Conn, (writing 
us at the same time), for any necessary 
repairs. The removal of the clock will 
detach it from lever (1), and expose a 
square wire hook. Oven may then be 
operated as the oven of an ordinary gas 
range by pulling down lever (1) and 
pushing over bent square wire hook to 
left, which locks lever (1) down. To 
turn off gas, simply release square wire 
hook by pushing to right. 

If trouble of any kind is experienced, 
write to 

The Sentinel Manufacturing Co., 
New Haven, Conn.

"Automatic" Dinners and Luncheons 



In order to make this book doubly 
helpful we are publishing a number of 
complete " automatic " dinners and 
luncheons. Not only do we give the 
menus, but in each case we give careful 
directions for the preparation of each 
dish and the cooking time and stove 
directions for the complete meal. 

These dinners we recommend for 
" automatic cooking." 

The complete dinner can go into the 
oven all at the same time, excepting 
where it is specifically stated that some 



dish is to be prepared on the top of the 
stove. 

You may prepare any of these meals 
as directed, place in the fireless-cooking 
oven, set the Cooking Clock, light the 
gas, and then forget all about your 
dinner until meal-time. Your own 
experience and imagination will suggest 
many other combinations, and the mar- 
velous convenience of this wonder-stove 
will grow on you from day to day as 
you learn more and more to depend 
upon this simple new method of cooking.

A Dinner in the Fireless - Cooking Oven 

This picture 
shows oven open 
and illustrates an 
entire chicken din- 
ner arranged in ov- 
en, ready to cook. 

The chicken is 
put in uncovered 
roasting pan and 
set on rack on first 
or second oven 
groove. Potatoes 
are peeled and put 
around chicken in 
roasting pan. 

The two alumi- 
num utensils on the 
same rack contain 
vegetables. They 
are tightly covered. 

On the top rack is an aluminum kettle (tightly covered) containing soup, 
and an open baking dish containing an apple tapioca pudding. 

Everything is put in cold and the oven itself is cold. When everything 
is in, simply set the Dial Hand of the Cooking Clock, light the gas and shut 
the oven door — and you are free until dinner time! 

Never place anything directly on the Thermostone.

Questions You May Ask 



Q. Suppose I find that my roasts do not 
get done through on the times given 
in the roasting Time Table? 

A. Then allow 5 (or even 10) minutes 
more Direct Heat. 

Q. Suppose I find that my roasts get too 
done on the times given in the 
roasting Time Table? 

A. Then give about five minutes less 
Direct Heat. 

Q. Is the Broiler automatic? 

A. No. It is used just as any other 
Broiler. 

Q. Are the cooking-top burners auto- 
matic? 

A. No. They are used just as the 
cooking-top burners of any other 
gas range. 

Q. When I cook a roast and several 
vegetables together do I allow the 
time for the roast as given in the 
roasting Time Table, plus the time 
for separate vegetables as given in 
the vegetable Time Table? 

A. No. Two extra dishes can be cooked 
with roast without any extra time. 
fSee Note at side of roasting Time 
Table.) The times for separate veg- 
etables are given to guide you in case 
you wish to cook one or more veg- 
etables alone (or with a pudding, 
etc.). In such case, use the time for 
longest cooking vegetable (or other 
dish) as explained on Time Table. 

Q. Suppose I have been doing some 
cooking — baking, for instance — and 
my oven is still hot when it is time 
to put in my dinner, which the cook 
book says should be started in cold 
oven. Do I have to wait for oven to 
get cold? 

A. No. You can put your meal right 
in, even though the oven is still 
warm — or even hot. If quite hot, 
you would allow perhaps five or ten 
minutes less Direct Heat than if 
starting with cold oven. As a rule 
we recommend starting meals to 
cook in cold oven because that 
is the foundation principle of "auto- 
matic cooking," but it is not abso- 
lutely necessary. 

Q. Suppose I have no meat dish to 
cook, but wish merely to cook sev- 
eral vegetables together, or perhaps 
vegetables and a pudding? 

A. Use the time of the longest-cooking 
dish, as given in the Time Table. 
Three dishes will cook on this time. 
If more than three dishes, add five 
minutes for each additional dish. 

Q. Suppose I make a mistake and turn 
the Dial Hand too far? Can I turn 
it backward? 

A. Yes. You can turn the Dial Hand 
either way without injury to the 
Cooking Clock. 

Page 14 



Q. Can I remove the Thermostone 
frame in the bottom of oven to clean 
oven? 

A. Yes. It can be lifted out readily. 
When putting back, be sure that the 
part of the frame with the Uoo legs 
is toward the front, and that the legs 
on the sides of the frame fit down 
into the notches in the round collar 
in the bottom of the oven. Never 
put the soapstones in water. 

Q. Do I need to take out the Thermo- 
stone when using oven as ordinary 
gas range oven? 

A. No. Never take out Thermostone 
except to clean oven. 

Q. Can I open the oven door while my 
dinner is cooking and turn potatoes, 
baste the roast, etc.? 

A. You can if you wish, ivhile the gas is 
burning, though it is not necessary 
ordinarily. 

Q. Can I cook in this oven just as in any 
other gas range oven, getting the 
oven hot before putting in meats, 
cooking entirely on Direct Heat, 
and turning gas low just as I would 
in the usual gas range? 

A. Yes. But we do not recommend 
doing this. It wastes gas, requires 
constant watching, and the food will 
not be as deliciously cooked as it will 
if you use this stove as it was in- 
tended — ^as an automatic fireless- 
cooking gas stove. When used as 
such it saves your time, saves gas, 
and frees you from the kitchen for 
several hours each day. 

Q. Need I turn the gas down when do- 
ing automatic cooking? 

A. No. The gas must be turned on full 
for the length of time given in the 
Time Table when doing automatic 
cooking of meats, vegetables, etc. 
The Retained Heat period (after the 
gas is turned off) corresponds to 
turning the gas low in the ordinary 
gas range, and it saves on your gas 
bill. 



Q. Can I leave the kitchen after my 
dinner is in to cook? 

A. Yes. You can leave the house if you 
wish and be gone for several hours. 
The Cooking Clock will shut the gas 
off automatically at the time you 
set it for and after that the Retained 
Heat will complete the cooking, but 
it will not be hot enough to burn 
anything. 



Questions You May \sk 



Q. How is it possible to cook at the 
same time, foods each of which 
ordinarily requires a different length 
of time? 

A. This is possible because the temper- 
ature at which foods are cooked in 
the fireless- cooking oven is far less 
than is commonly used. The in- 
tense direct heat is onlj'^ used to start 
the cooking. The gentle Retained 
Heat is hot enough to complete the 
cooking but not hot enough to spoil 
those foods which must remain in 
the oven longer than if cooked alone. 
It is high temperature or intense heal 
that breaks down the food fibre, not 
length of time. 

Q. Can puddings be cooked with auto- 
matic dinners? 

A. Yes, but you must not expect the 
impossible of the range in the prep- 
aration of dinners; and while with 
meat or fish dishes practically every 
vegetable and soup can be com- 
bined, we must remember that 
puddings requiring long cooking will 
be those especially suited for auto- 
matic dinners. All tapioca puddings, 
bread puddings, fruit puddings, 
steamed suet puddings, the rice 
desserts, and baked Indian pud- 
dings are practical examples. 

Q. Will not puddings and other delicate 
foods be flavored by odorous veget- 
ables, fish or meats when cooked at 
the same time? 

A. No. Odorous vegetables will not 
flavor other food materials placed 
in the oven at the same time 
if both are started at the same 
time — cold, in a cold oven. The 



boiling and the baking point will 
be reached at practically the same 
time. Onions placed in cold 
salted water may be put into the 
oven with a cold pudding and no 
odor can be given the pudding 
until the onions begin to boil. 
Neither can any odor be taken up 
by the pudding after it is heated 
through and it will always be 
thoroughly heated before the boiling 
point of the onions is reached. 
Puddings thus cooked will never be 
"onion-flavored." However, should 
the onions be placed in boiling water 
or the boiling point be reached be- 
fore the cold pudding is put into the 
oven, we would not answer as to the 
flavor of the pudding. 

This principle is familiar to every 
housewife using a coal or gas oven. 
One would never think of plac- 
ing a pudding or cake in the oven 
when a partly baked fish, for ex- 
ample, was already heated through 
and baking. 

Q. How long will the iireless-cooking 
oven hold its heat? 

A. The oven will hold its heat long 
enough to thoroughly cook any ordi- 
nary meal and keep it "piping hot" 
a reasonable length of time. 

We do not claim, however, that 
the oven will keep a meal steaming 
hot for a period of five or six hours 
after it is thoroughly done and 
should properly be served. On 
the other hand, should you leave a 
meal in the oven an unusual length 
of time — several hours after it is 
done — and find it not steaming hot, 
you need only light the oven burner 
for 10 or 15 minutes to heat meal 
thoroughly.

Questions and Answers on Baking 

Q. Can I bake several kinds of things at once? 

A. Yes, if they take about the same temperatures to start with and about the same 
period of Direct Heat. 

Q. Can I do baking at the same time I am cooking an automatic dinner? 

A. We do not recommend doing so, but it can be done successfully with many kinds 
of baking. For instance, an apple pie may bake all right with your dinner. Of 
course, in such a case the pie should not be put in until the oven is heated up to 
the proper temperature, as in any other range, and it would have to be taken out 
before the dinner was done. 

Q. Will it do any harm if I open the oven door to look at my baking? 

A. No, not if you close it again quickly. 

Q. Suppose I find that my baking burns on the top when placed on the grooves you recom- 
mend and is not done on the bottom? 

A. Place oven rack in a lower groove. 

Q. Suppose I find that my baking burns on the bottom and is not done on the top when 
placed on the grooves you recommend? 

A. Place oven rack in a higher groove. 
Q. Suppose I find that when I follow the temperatures and times given in the Baking 
Time Table, I burn my baking both top and bottom? 

A. Then cut down on the '' pre-heat " or the Direct Heat. These temperatures 
and times are merely given as helps for you at the start. You will soon learn how 
to make the stove bake to suit your personal tastes. 

Q. Suppose I find that, when I follow the temperatures and times given in the Baking 
Time Table, my baking does not get done enough? 

A. Then add to the time of Direct Heat, if not brown enough, or to the time of 
Retained Heat, if brown but not thorovghlij done. We repeat, this Time 
Table is merely printed as a help and is not made up of hard and fast rules. 

Q. Must I put my baking on an oven rack in exactly the groove mentioned in the Time 
Table? 

A. No, not necessarily. In our own Cooking Laboratory we have found these grooves 
to be the best, but you may find your stove slightly different, for there is a varia- 
tion in the pressure and richness of gas in various cities. This explains, also, why 
the times and temperatures for baking in your particular stove may vary from 
the Time Table. 

Q. Must I bake just the numbers of pans or loaves given in the last column of the Time 
Table? 

A. No, this number simply shows how many pans or loaves we baked in working out 
this Time Table. A larger number might bake on these times successfully, or, 
on the other hand, might require a little longer Direct Heat. In baking a 
smaller number it might be necessary to use a little less Direct Heat. Your 
own experience will soon show you. 

Q. Can I open the oven door occasionally to watch my baking, or to shift pans around 
in the oven? 

A. Yes, if necessary. You can do just as you would in baking in an ordinary gas or 
coal range if you wish, though, as a general rule, the less you bother the baking, 
the better. The usual turning about and shifting of pans is not often necessary 
in this oven, because the distribution of heat is more even than in most ovens. 

Q. Can I turn the gas down if I wish to? 

A. Yes, by turning Gas Cock (No. 3) partly down. This is very seldom necessary, 
however, for the period of Retained Heat (when the Thermostone is giving off 
its gentle heat) corresponds to turning the gas down in the usual gas range. Gen- 
erally, if your baking looks like it has come to the point when the gas should be 
turned low, you can, with this stove, turn the gas clear off, and the gentle Re- 
tained Heat will complete the baking perfectly. This means a saving of gas. 

In case you do ever have occasion to turn the gas down, be very careful that 
you do not turn it so low that it goes out. Be sure to shut the oven door gently. 

Q. Suppose the time for the baking of some bread, cake or pie that I may wish to bake 
is not given in the Baking Time Table? 

A. Select the time given for baking the pie, cake or bread most like the article you 
wish to bake. 

Q. Must I leave baking in for entire length of time given under Retained Heat if I feel 
sure it is done sooner? 

A. No. Take your baking out whenever you feel sure it is done, regardless of Time 
Table. 

Important Note — Be careful when baking in this stove, as in any other gas range, not to 
have a door or window open where it will cause a direct draught on the stove.

A Simple Baking Time Table 

In baking it is of course necessary, as with any other range, to pre-heat the oven. 
We give in the following Time Table the degrees of pre-heat necessary, followed by the 
number of minutes Direct Heat andithe number oi minutes Retained Heat, after the gas is shut 
off. We also suggest which groov<3 to place the oven rack on, and also the number of loaves 
or pans that were used in working out this Time Table. You may find other grooves better. 

These times are given only as helps. They are not hard and fast rules. Tour own 
experience will be the best guide for you to follow.

_ Footnote: — -The times given for " Direct Heat " and " Retained Heat " are only sugges- 
tions. We recommend that until you are thoroughly familiar with the stove you wateh 
your baking just as you would with any other stove. When the time comes that you 
would turn the gas low on any other stove, turn it clear of¥ instead. The Retained Heat 
given off by the Thermostone equals the heat given of a low gas flame in the ordinary gas 
stove. Take baking out whenever you feel sure it is done, regardless of Time Table.
