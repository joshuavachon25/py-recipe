WE are gratified to be able to present to our friends 
and patrons the ''Blue and Gold Cook Book" be- 
cause we believe that it will meet with the appre- 
ciation we hope for and can assure you that an extraordin- 
ary amount of time and care has been expended in collect- 
ing and editing this volume of recipes. We have found in 
our experience that almost every cook book which has 
heretofore been published has given too much space to 
ordinary recipes, within the ken of every experienced house- 
wife. 

Our assumption is that the lady who uses a cook book 
knows the ordinary rudiments of the Art of Cookery — that 
in turning to the pages of a cook book she does so in the 
anticipation of finding therein something new — something 
that will appeal through its very novelty. 

With that end in view we have delved deeply into the ques- 
tion and hope that our labors have not been in vain — and 
that the recipients of this book can truly say they have found 
therein something new — something worth while. 

The mistress of the home who is suddenly confronted with 
a houseful of company for either luncheon, dinner or supper, 
may turn to the menus which are provided and feel assured 
that any one of them is perfect in its way and will earn for 
the hostess the appreciation of her guests. 

You will find simple recipes — and elaborate ones — chafing 
dish specialties — canapes and salads — all essential factors 
that make for the successful meal — and the height of accom- 
plishment is atained when you augment these preparations 
with the zest contained in every bottle of Blue and Gold 
Lager. 

Very truly yours, 

OAKLAND BREWING AND MALTING CO.

Cooking 



Cooking is the art of preparing food by the aid of heat. 
for the nourishment of the human body. The principal ways 
of cooking are boiling, broiling, stewing, roasting, baking, 
frying, sauteing, braising, fricasseing and steaming. 

Boiling: Cooking in boiling water. BoiHng point, 212 F. 

Broiling: Cooking over a glowing fire. 

Steaming: Cooking over boiling water. 

Stewing: Cooking for a long time in water below the 
boiling point. Simmering point, 185 F. 

Roasting: Cooking before a glowing fire. 

Baking: Cooking in an oven. 

Frying: Cooking in hot deep fat, deep enough to cover 
article to be cooked. 

Sauteing: Cooking in a small quantity of fat. 

Braising: A combination of stewing and baking. 

Fricasseing: A combination of frying and stewing. 

HOUSEHOLD RULES—HOW TO MEASURE. 

All measurements should be made LEVEL. 

Accurate measurement is essential to insure good cooking. 

A half -pint cup is the standard. They can be had with 
fourths and thirds indicated. 

A cupful is a cup filled LEVEL with the top. To measure 
a cupful, fill lightly with a spoon, taking care not to shake 
the cup; then level with the knife. 

A spoonful is a spoon filled LEVEL with the top. First 
sift the material into the bowl, dip in the spoon, lift it slightly 
heaping, and level it by sliding the side of a knife across the 
top of the spoon. Do not level by pressing it. 

Half a spoonful is obtained by dividing through the mid- 
dle lengthwise. 

A speck of anything is what will lie within a space >4 
inch square. 



COOKING. 



WHAT COOKS SHOULD KNOW. 

Allow four eggs to each quart of milk in making cup 
custards. 

Allow from four to six eggs to each quart of milk in mak- 
ing a custard to be turned from the mold. 

Rice will absorb three times its measure of water and a 
large quantity of milk or stock. 

One ounce of butter equals two level tablespoons. 

One ounce of flour equals four tablespoons. 

One ounce of butter and one-half ounce of flour are used 
to thicken one cup of liquid in making a sauce. 

Allow two level teaspoons of baking powder to each cup 
of flour when no eggs are used. 

One cup of sugar will sweeten one quart of any mixture to 
be served chilled or frozen. 

One teaspoon ful of extract will flavor one quart of custard 
or pudding to be served unfrozen. 

One teaspoonful of extract will flavor one quart of mix- 
ture to be frozen. 

One level teaspoon of salt will season one quart of soup, 
sauce or vegetables. 

The ordinary French dressing (three tablespoons oil, one 
and one-half tablespoons vinegar, one- fourth level teaspoon 
salt, one-eighth level teaspoon pepper, and one-quarter tea- 
spoon of sugar) will marinate one pint of salad. 

One teaspoon of water or milk should be allowed for each 
egg in making an omelet. 

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES AT A GLANCE. 

The Fountain of Good Cookery is Accuracy. 

By level measurements are meant a spoon or cup filled 
full with dry material, then leveled off smooth, to the spoon's 
edge. Flour is sifted before being lifted into the cup or

LOBSTER a la BURNHAM. 

This dish is always appreciated at picnics, and makes a 
nice change for Sunday supper. 

Required: One lobster, half a pint of mayonnaise sauce, 
six ounces of rice, a small beet. 

Wash the rice. Boil it in plenty of fast boiling, salted 
water until it is just tender, then pour it into a colander, 
wash it well under the cold water tap, then dry it carefully, 
either spread on a plate in a cool oven or on the hot plate. 

Supposing it is for supper, it is quite easy to arrange it 
prettily, with the lobster in the center, the rice round as a 
border, and the beet root as a garnish. 

In any case, remove all meat from the lobster, and cut it 
into large dice. Then if it is for a picnic wrap it up in a piece 
of waxed paper, which can be bought at any stationer's — this 
will prevent it from drying. Then put it in a tin or jar. 
Press the rice into another jar, and tie a piece of paper over 
the top. Peel and slice the beet and fold that also in waxed 
paper. Put the sauce into a bottle with a tightly-fitting cork. 

These jars, etc., can be safely packed into the hamper. 
When required, divide the lobster into portions, arrange them 
in neat heaps on "woodpulp" plates, arrange a thick border of 
rice around, garnish with the beet and serve the sauce with it.

CRAB MEAT CHOPS. 

2 cup fuls crab meat, boiled 1 teaspoon chopped parsley, 

and picked, ^ teaspoon chopped onion, 

1 cup thick white sauce, Yi teaspoon salt, 

Cayenne pepper. 



56 SHELL FISH. 



Make thick white sauce, mix with the rest of the in- 
gredients. 

Cook all together and cool. Make 8 separate heaps of 
this and let stand an hour. Take each heap and form into a 
chop shape, dip in beaten egg, dredge in cracker dust and fry 
in hot, deep fat. Serve with hot Tartare sauce, or Hol- 
landaise sauce. 

DEVILED CRABS. 

Put one-half pound of butter into a saucepan with one 
tablespoonful of flour, and cook together, stirring it con- 
tinually to prevent its burning ; add to it one large tumbler- 
ful of rich cream, one boiled soft onion mashed to a paste 
or pulp, a little grated nutmeg, and season with salt and 
cayenne pepper. Then put in the crab meat, enough to 
fill eight crab shells and raw egg or two, stir together 
well and cook until it begins to thicken, which will only 
take a few minutes ; then pour it all on a flat dish and allow 
it to stand until cold. Now fill the back crab shells with 
the mixture, egg them over with a brush and cover with 
grated breadcrumbs or cracker dust. Place them in a bak- 
ingpan, put a small lump of butter on top .of each, and 
bake in a slow oven to a light brown color, or fry them in 
plenty of hot lard. 

CLAM FRITTERS. 
Place some fresh clams into one pan, and the liquor from 
them into another. Prepare a mixture of broken crackers 
and flour in equal quantities, and dip the clams first into 
their own liquor and then into this, repeating this opera- 
tion three times; finally dipping them into milk, and then 
again into the flour mixture. Have prepared some boil- 
ing lard, drop in a few clams at a time, let them fry for 
about five minutes, then remove them with a skimmer, 
place them on a strainer, drain away the fat, and they are

PAN BROILED STEAK. 

Pan broiling of a stake means to broil in a hot pan in 
place of over the coals. It should not be confused with 
frying, sauteing, or any such method. The hot pan should 
be rubbed with a piece of fat just as the broiler is greased 
to keep the steak from sticking, and the steak broiled in it 
precisely as described for broiling over the coals. The pan 
should be very hot at first, the steak seared on both sides, 
then allowed to cook more slowly, but turned every ten 
counts as carefully as if over the coals. In lifting to turn 
it put the fork in the extreme end of the steak, if a fork 
must be used. Any fat that runs out of the steak in cook- 
ing should be poured off in order to prevent the fried look 
or taste that will result if the meat is sauted in its own fat. 

SPANISH STEAK. 
Take three pounds of round steak, cut two and one-half 
inches thick, season with one level tablespoonful of salt, a 
saltspoonful of pepper and butter the size of an egg. Place 
in the oven in a sheet iron baking pan with half a cup of 
water, and cook thirty minutes, then cover with a layer of 
sliced raw onions and cook three-quarters of an hour; add a 
layer of sliced tomatoes, cook until tender, sprinkle with 
grated cheese, and when brown serve with a gravy made 
from the liquor in the pan. 

DANISH BEEF. 
Take one pound of chopped round steak. Make little 
pates and fry to a nice brown in a chunk of butter. Then 
salt and pepper — not until then. Removes pates from frying 
pan — put three good sized onions sliced and add a cup and 
one-half of water. Let simmer five minutes. Then thicken 
with flour and pour over pates.

I FRIZZLED BEEF TETRAZZINL 

Shave into thin slices the best smoked beef you can get. 
Over these pour boiHng water. Leave the water on the beef 
not longer than a second. Place it in a collander, thoroughly 
draining off the water. Be careful to make this draining 
process thorough, for it takes away the salt taste of the beef. 
Then place the beef in a frying-pan in which has been melted 
a tablespoonful of butter and a half cupful of cream into 
which a heaping tablespoonful of flour has been stirred. Stir 
these well with the meat. Pour in last a cupful of sweet 
milk and season sharply with pepper. Just before milk comes 
to a boil drop in two tablespoonsful of sharp grated cheese. 
Take off as soon as milk boils. 

BEEF'S TONGUE, A LA JARDINIERE. 

Boil fresh beef's tongue one hour; skin and lay in your 
roaster upon a layer of vegetables cut into dice — carrots, tur- 
nips and celery, potatoes, peas, beans, and if you can get 
them, button onions and small round tomatoes. Pour about 
the tongue some of the water in which it was boiled ; cover 
and cook slowly for two hours if the tongue be large. 

Remove the tongue, keep it closely covered and hot while 
you take out the vegetables with a skimmer. Thicken the 
gravy with browned flour. Dish the tongue, arrange the veg- 
etables in sorted heaps about it, and pour some of the gravy 
over all, sending rest to table in sauceboat.

1 small carrot, cut in dice, 1 cup strained tomatoes, 
1 tablespoon flour, 1 bay leaf. 

Salt and pepper the meat and dust with the flour. Heat 
the fat in a frying pan and brown the meat in it on all sides. 
Place meat in casserole, add other ingredients, cover and let 
simmer at a low temperature until tender, keeping the cas- 
serole well covered so as not to allow the steam and juices 
to escape. Serve hot with mashed or baked potatoes. 

BEEFSTEAK WITH OYSTERS. 

Broil a sirloin or tenderloin steak; season; take a quart 
of oysters and drain off the liquor; put into stewpan with 
half a cupful of butter — less butter if you have a little 
cream to add. Salt and pepper to season it. When this 
comes to a boil pour over the steak on the platter. Serve 
very hot. 

ROAST LAMB. 

Salt and pepper and dredge with flour, place on rake of 
dripping pan with 1 cup water in hot oven. When brown 
baste every 15 minutes. It will take about 2 hours to roast 
a medium sized roast. 

Leg of lamb may be boned and stuffed with bread dressing. 
Serve with mint sauce, or mint sherbet. 

CROWN OF LAMB. 

Select parts from two loins containing ribs, scrape flesh 
from bone between ribs, as far as lean meat and trim off back- 



MEA'lS. 61 



bone. Shape each piece in a semicircle, having ribs outside 
and sew pieces together to form a crown. Trim ends of 
bones evenly and rather short and wrap each bone in a thin 
strip of the fat scraps to prevent bone from burning. Roast 
lj4 hours or until tender, covering bones with buttered paper. 
Remove fat from bones before serving and fill center with 
peas, puree of chestnut, or mashed potatoes. 

MUTTON STEW WITH RICE. 

After the mutton has been cut in pieces and cooked, add 
four good tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, season with 
salt and pepper ; let it cook at a slow fire ten or twelve min- 
utes. 

Then add a dozen small carrots, a bunch of parsley, 
thyme, bay leaves and a mite of garlic. Moisten with a 
quart of water, cover the saucepan and cook genrtly for an 
hour. 

MUTTON CURRY. 

Fry one tablespoon chopped onion in one tablespoon but- 
ter. Mix one tablespoon curry powder and one teaspoon 
salt with one tablespoon flour. Stir this into the butter and 
onion and add, gradually, one pint hot water or stock. Cut 
two pounds cold lean mutton (roasted or boiled) in pieces 
and add to the sauce. Simmer until tender and serve with 
a border of boiled rice. 

FRENCH MUTTON STEW. 

Having cut the mutton in pieces cook it in a saucepan 
at a sharp fire with clarified fat or lard. Season with salt 
and pepper. 

When the pieces of mutton are well browned, drain out 
nearly all the fat. Add two large soupspoonfuls of flour. 
Cook for several minutes and moisten with a full quart 
of water. Add two skinned tomatoes, or two spoonfuls of 
tomato puree, a bunch of parsley, thyme, a bay leaf, and a 
tiny piece of garlic.

MUTTON STEW WITH WHITE BEANS. 

The beans must be cooked separately and in advance. 
Cut the mutton in pieces and cook till brown, as in the pre- 
ceding method. Then add several large onions divided 
into four, two carrots cut in pieces and two soup-spoon- 
fuls of flour. Let this cook several minutes and moisten 
with a quart of water. 

Add salt and pepper as desired, two or three good ta- 
blespoonfuls of tomato puree, a bunch of parsley, thyme, a 
bay leaf, and a mite of garlic. Cover the saucepan and let 
it cook gently for about an hour. Change the pieces of 
mutton to another saucepan, skim the sauce in the first 
saucepan, strain it over the mutton through a fine strainer. 
Add the white beans, already cooked, and let it simmer 
twenty-five or thirty minutes. Skim the ragout again be- 
fore serving. 

In hot countries mutton often holds the taste of the 
wool. In such cases it is useful to boil it for a few min- 
utes in salted water before cooking. 

IRISH STEW. 

Cut up two pounds of mutton, place the pieces in a 
saucepan of convenient size. The best meat for this pur- 
pose is from the breast, the neck or the shoulder. Cut in 
pieces of three to four ounces. 

Add a large glass of water, then put the saucepan on 
the fire, cover it and let the water evaporate completely. 
Add another glass of water, allow it to evaporate and then 
salt and pepper to taste. Next add four large onions di- 
vided into quarters, a bunch of parsley, thyme and bay. 

Moisten with just sufficient water to cover the meat 
completely. Cover the saucepan and let it boil for twen- 
ty-five to thirty minutes. Then add to the mutton tv/o 
pounds of potatoes skinned and divided in four. Cover 



MEATS. 63 



them with hot water. Season them again if you like it 
highly seasoned. Cover the saucepan and finish cooking. 
Remove the bunch of herbs before serving. 

This dish is also excellent, if sliced carrots and tur- 
nips are added. In this case you must also slice up the po- 
tatoes. Be careful to put the carrots and turnips to cook 
fifteen minutes before the potatoes. Potatoes cooked to 
pieces spoil the stew. 

In this method no flour thickening should be used. 

SAUERBRATEN. 

For six people. Take 4 pounds of rump, chuck or sir- 
loin, pound it, put into 2 quarts vinegar with 1 onion cut 
into slices, 10 pepper-corns, 3 bay leaves, 3 cloves and salt.

this time, take out and lard with bacon cut into pieces 1-3 
inch thick and 2J^ inches long. Pierce meat with a pointed 
knife and insert the bacon. Heat the lard and fry meat 
light brown, both sides, and place on a platter. Brown 
the flour in the lard and pour on the vinegar with spices, 
water and salt. Put in piece of honeycake (PfefTer 
Kuchen) if on hand, and J^ tablespoonful sugar, boil all 
and put the roasted meat into this gravy. The meatroast 
must be covered and baked in over 2J/2 to 3 hours while 
turning it, basting with gravy. One-half hour before done, 
pour in J^^ glass red wine. When the roast is tender, finish 
the gravy. Put the roast on platter, take all grease off the 
gravy and strain. If too thick, add water; if not sour 
enough, add vinegar. 

BRISKET OF CORNED BEEF WITH VEGETABLES. 

A piece of fancy brisket of corned or saltpetered beef, 
say five or six pounds, should be cooked in plenty of water 
until tender, with two carrots, two onions, one-half a head

the same shape the same weight of potatoes as of meat. 
Season the potatoes and toss them in butter. This done, 
put half their quantity into a saucepan with the meat, and 
cover the whole with a few tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce 
and some reduced meat gravy; heat without allowing to 
boil. Distribute the remainder of the potatoes, which should 
be crisply fried, over the hash, and sprinkle with a pinch of 
freshly chopped parsley. In hash the meat must never be 
allowed to boil or it will become hard.

VEAL CHEESE. 

Prepare equal quantities of boiled sliced veal and smoked 
tongue. Pound the slices separately in a mortar, moistening 
with butter as you proceed, then pack it in a jar or pail, 
mixing it in alternating layers, first the tongue and then the 
veal, so that when it is cut it will look variegated. Press 
it down hard and pour melted butter over the top. Keep it 
well covered and in a dry place. Nice for sandwiches or

Meanwhile scald the onions six times. Brown the butter 
and sugar, add half a pint of the water in which the ham has 
been boiled, a drop or two of lemon juice and a teaspoon ful 
of meat extract, and stew the onions in it till brown, the 
sauce being just sufficient to cover them. 

When the ham is done, remove the thick skin and lay the 
ham in a baking-pan. Pour over it some of the brown sauce 
(in making of which, water in which the ham has been boiled 
and the meat extract are employed) and some of the wine

SOUFFLE POTATOES. 

Peel the potatoes and drop them into ice-water. Slice 
them then lengthwise in rather thin slices and drop the 
slices into more ice-water. Have over the fire two frying 
pans containing frying fat, only have one pan in a hotter 
place than the other. Take the potatoes from the water, 
wipe quickly, drop into the pan that is in the cooler place 
to cook for a few minutes, then skim them out and drop 
into the pan with the very hot fat in, when they will souffle 
or expand so remarkably that it will seem a little magic 
has taken place on the kitchen range. 

HUNGARIAN POTATO DUMPLINGS. 

Take about two cupfuls of cold mashed potatoes, stir 
through them two eggs and enough flour to make a stiff 
dough. Now roll this out, strew it thickly with fried bread

Boil an egg hard and serve on top of spinach in quarters or 
grate the egg. 

SPINACH COOKED IN BUTTER. 

Cook the spinach leaves in a pan with salted water. 
Wash them freely with water to remove the sand which 
they may contain completely. Drain them, press out the 
moisture and chop them up very fine. Heal some butter in 
a saucepan, add the chopped spinach, stir them up with a 
long wooden spoon, adding a little butter. This will work 
out the moisture. Season them to taste with salt and a 
little scraped nutmeg. Finished by adding an ounce and 
a half of fine butter. 

SPINACH "AU NATUREL." 

Having cooked the spinach in salt water as before, wash 
and drain the leaves carefully, then remove all water and 
give them a few strokes with the knife without chopping 
them up. Put them into a frying pan in which you have 
heated some butter; salt to taste and serve very hot. 

This method of preparing spinach is very much appre- 
ciated in Italy, where they add filets of anchovies to it. 

SPINACH WITHOUT WATER. 

The following method is very little known and has the 
advantages of preserving all the nutriment in the spinach 
and avoiding the use of boiling water. 

Having washed and drained the spinach very thorough- 
ly, cut it up in coarse pieces and put it in a saucepan in 
which you have heated three and a half ounces of butter to 
every pound of spinach. Add salt, grated nutmeg and cook 
sharply.

move a piece about an inch in diameter from the blossom end 
of each and remove the seeds. Cook a cup of rice in a quart 
of well-seasoned broth, with half a green pepper cut fine. 
When the rice is nearly tender, add half a cup of butter 
and mix thoroughly, but carefully, to avoid breaking the 
grains. Fill the tomato shells with the rice; put back the 
covers, set in a baking pan, stem end down, brush over the

side with a little salt and pepper. Chop onion fine; place in 
saucepan with butter and cook for three minutes to brown, 
being careful not to burn. Add mushrooms and the chicken 
livers chopped. Season with a little salt and pepper. Cook

actly with a very thin round of American cheese; spread 
with mayonnaise, add another slice of tomato and put a 
spoonful of mayonnaise on top. 

TOMATO STUFFED WITH SARDINES. 

Select large ripe tomatoes of uniform size and pare them 
carefully with a sharp knife. Set on the ice to harden and 
cut out the hearts neatly, leaving the walls whole. Pre- 
pare the filling by skimming boneless sardines and laying 
them upon tissue paper to absorb the oil. Then scrape as 
you would pick codfish for balls, and work in a little lemon 
juice and a dash of white pepper. Toss and work with a 
silver fork until smooth and fill the tomatoes with the mix- 
ture. The combination of flavors is very pleasant. 

HOT SLAW. 
Pick off the bad leaves from head of small cabbage, slice 
or cut the cabbage very thin, scald it 5 minutes in 2 quarts 
of boiling water and drain through a colander. Mix it well 
with a sauce made of ^ cup of hot vinegar, 1 cup of sour 
cream, yolks of 2 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of oil, salt and pep- 
per to taste. 



Salad 



HOW TO MAKE A SALAD AND HOW TO SERVE IT. 

First, all materials should be secured fresh, they must be 
well cleansed, washed without handling, and all water re- 
moved as much as possible. The salad should be made imme- 
diately before the meal and be kept cool until wanted. Never 
place a salad in the ice-box where meat is kept. 

If no objection, a garlic flavor is healthy and improves 
all salads very much. A slight rubbing of the salad bowl 
with a clove of garlic or the crust of a small piece of bread 
rubbed with garlic and put in the salad bowl will improve 
the flavor of a moderate-sized salad. 

Chopped fresh tarragon, chervils, or chives give a fine 
taste to all salads. 

The yolk of an egg will give a good body and improve 
all salads. To make a good dressing you must have good 
oil and vinegar. Olive oil and red wine vinegar are pre- 
ferred. If you cannot get red wine vinegar you can add a 
wine glass of red wine to a quart of dressing, which Es 
made of white wine or cider vinegar. If you run short of 
oil use melted butter, cream or some gravy of some kind of 
roast meat, mix with the yolk of an egg. If you run short 
of vinegar the juice of two lemons to half a wine glass of 
red wine will answer the purpose. If your oil gets cloudy 
or frozen, add a teaspoonful of salt to a quart and it will 
clear inside of twenty-four hours. 

SALAD POINTERS. 

Potato salad is best made of warm potatoes. 

Mix salt thoroughly through your minced potatoes before 
adding the dressing to prevent flat taste. 

Wash the lettuce under cold running water and it will be 
crisp* 



124 SALADS. 



Vegetables for salads should be thoroughly dry or the 
dressing will not stick. 

All salads should be thoroughly chilled. 

Stir mayonnaise with an egg beater if hurried. 

For smooth dressing, blend with a fork, not a spoon. 

Mix the flour and sugar together dry for dressing, then 
add boiling water and stir. 

If dressing curdles, add cold water and stir quickly. 

If the vinegar is heated before adding to the dressing, 
it will not curdle. 

If mustard is mixed with milk instead of water it will 
not dry out. 

If a slit is made through the cork of the olive bottle and 
the bottle propped at the right angle,the oil may be dropped 
into the dressing without constant personal attention. 

A Spanish proverb says that to make salad requires four 
persons: "A spendthrift for oil, a miser for vinegar, a 
lawyer for salt, and a madman to stir it up." 

ALSATIAN SALAD. 

Arrange the usual bed of lettuce. Cook three frankfurter 
sausages for a few minutes in boiling water. Chill these and 
cut into very thin slices. Slice four medium-size cold potatoes 
and one small white onion, half a dozen firm pickles and stir 
this mixture lightly with four tablespoons of French dressing. 
Serve on the bed of lettuce leaves. 

EGG SALAD. 

Cut hard-boiled eggs in half lengths, rub their yolks 
through a sieve, mix with equal weight of Parmesan 
cheese, season with chopped chives, pepper and salt, and 
enough butter to moisten. Fill the whites with this mix- 
ture, serve on lettuce, and garnish with sliced tomatoes. 

SCRAMBLED EGG SALAD. 

Select evenly sized tomatoes, cut in halves, scoop out 



SALADS. 125 



the pulp, and fill the hollows with scrambled eggs well sea- 
soned. When cold, spread enough mayonnaise on each to 
cover the egg, and put a thick layer of aspic on top. Ar- 
range neatly in a circle on a cold dish, and garnish with 
beets and gherkins cut in fancy shapes. Fill the center with 
lettuce and sliced tomatoes, all cut in fine strips, and season 
with pepper, salt, oil, and vinegar. Serve very cold. 

ITALIAN EGG SALAD. 

Is a particularly suitable salad for supper. It is light and 
yet contains a good deal of nourishment in the eggs, maca- 
roni, and cream. 

Required: Six hard boiled eggs, a good lettuce, a round 
of toast, four tablespoon fuls of mayonnaise dressing, four 
tablespoon fuls of cream, one tablespoonful of chopped pars- 
ley, three ounces of macaroni, a few red chillies and capers. 

Shell the eggs and cut them in thick rings. Wash and 
lightly dry the lettuce, then pull it in pieces. Trim ofl the 
crusts from the toast, and put it in the salad bowl. 

Whisk the cream until it is thick, then stir into it the may- 
onnaise sauce and parsley. Have the macaroni ready boiled 
until tender in boiling salted water; cut it into short lengths. 

Put a layer of lettuce on the toast, then one of eggs, next 
macaroni, and then some of the dressing; continue until all 
the ingredients are used. 

EGG LILY SALAD. 

Drop hard-boiled eggs into cold water after taking 
them out of the shells, and cut narrow strips from the 
small end very nearly to the large end of the whites. Rub 
up each yolk with a teaspoonful of butter, one of vinegar, 
one each of mustard and salt and pepper. Form into balls 
and put back into the whites. Serve in moulds of spinach 
or, on lettuce leaves with mayonnaise.

and olives into the mayonnaise and mix all well together. 
Garnish with gherkins and tiny onions. Asparagus may be 
substituted for peas. 

JELLIED CHICKEN AND CELERY SALAD. 

Make the chicken jelly and set it in a border mould. 
Chop three bunches of celery, and mix with one can of as- 
paragus tips. When the jelly is cold, set on a platter, and 
heap the celery and asparagus in the center. Slice four 
hard boiled eggs and lay around the jelly in little piles, alter- 
nating with mayonnaise dressing. 

This IS also nice made with fruit jelly with fruit in 
center, omitting the egg and using French dressing made 
with lemon instead of the mayonnaise.

APPLE STRUDEL. 

Take one pint of flour, sift it into a bowl, make a hole 
in the center of the flour, pour in half a cupful of warm 
water, four ounces of butter, two whole eggs and two yolks 
and a pinch of salt. Stir this slowly making a smooth 
dough. Cover up the dough and keep in a warm place un- 
til you have pared half a peck of apples ; cut or shave them 
very fine. Now cover your kitchen table with a clean ta- 
ble cloth, sift flour all over it and roll out your dough as 
thin as possible. Then use your hands, placing them under 
the rolled dough, and stretch it gently, very gently so as 
not to tear it, walking all around the table as you do this 
to get it even and thin as tissue paper. Pour a few table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter over the dough, mix the apples, 
some brown sugar, cinnamon, seeded raisins and a little 
citron cut fine. Take hold, of the table cloth with both 
hands at the corners, lift it and begin to roll the strudel. 
After it is rolled place in a buttered pan, put flakes of but- 
ter on top. When half baked pour a cupful of cream over 
it and finish baking. Bake about half an hour. 

HUNGARIAN STRUDEL. 

Put into a mixing bowl about one and one-half coffee 
cups of flour (good measure) ; add suflicient warm water to 
make a paste soft enough to beat with the hand (not 
knead), until it no longer sticks to the bowl. This will 



156 DESSERT. 



take only a few minutes. Now take a table cloth, spread 
on half of a dining table, sift flour over it thinly, but have 
the cloth thoroughly covered with it. Put the dough on 
this and roll, especially thin in the center, until it is as 
large as a small tray. Now stop rolling and begin to 
stretch it. It will not stretch well unless warm. If you 
have allowed your dough to get cold take a hot frying pan 
and hold it over the dough for a few moments, when it 
will stretch easily. This stretching is rather a difficult 
proceeding, as you must be careful not to break holes in 
it, and it must be almost as thin as tissue paper. A thick 
dough is to be avoided, neither must you leave thick edges. 
After it is sufficiently stretched strew over it thickly and 
evenly six or eight finely chopped tart apples, currants, 
raisins or both, finely shaved citron or orange peel (can- 
died), grated almonds, sugar and cinnamon, and, lastl}^, a 
cup of melted butter, free from all salt, poured over all. 
Now take an edge of the table cloth firmly in both hands 
and roll it quickly from you; in a moment you have before 
you a large thick roll, which form into a round or oblong 
shape, according to the pan in which you wish to bake it. 
The only way to put it into the pan without breaking it is 
to take hold of the cloth and whisk the strudel into the pan 
upside down. Pour more butter on top and place in a 
pretty warm oven; baste with butter that accumulates in 
the pan and bake to a golden brown. Eat warm.

Chafing Disn Specialties 



HOW TO USE THE CHAFING DISH. 

A chafing dish ought to be of extra heavy tin or some 
other metal tinned or nickel-plated. A large flame alcohol 
lamp should be underneath so as to have a good heat if 
needed, or a smaller lamp only to be used if light heat is 
required. In cooking oysters or similar articles a brisk heat 
is necessary, for making rarebits less fire is used. The blazer

Chop five ounces of soft cheese into small bits and put 
into a chafing dish with one egg, a level tablespoonful of 
butter, half a teaspoon ful of salt, a pinch of cayenne, a level 
teaspoonful of mustard and five tablespoon fuls of milk. 
Cook over boiling water until the cheese is soft and creamy, 
then set where it will keep hot without cooking for a few 
minutes. Toast five slices of bread and keep hot. Poach 
two eggs for each slice. Spread the cheese mixture quickly 
over each slice of toast and place over this two eggs on each 
piece. Have a little butter, salt, pepper and mustard rubbed 
together, put a tiny bit on each egg and serve at once. This 
makes a delicious tid-bit for "unpremeditated" suppers.

STEAK MANSFIELD. 

The late Richard Mansfield was a fine cook, and some of 
his favorite recipes have been preserved by his friends who 
were his guests at times, and who often watched him preside 
over the chafing dish. The following was one of Mr. 
Mansfield^s most favored dishes : 

Cut a piece of suet about the size of an ^gg into small bits 
and put it in the chafing dish. Also add the same amount of 
butter. When this melts and is hot, place in the dish a fine 
porterhouse steak about three inches thick. It is better to 
have the bone removed, if serving for many persons. Let 
the steak get hot on both sides, and then cut the surface with 
a sharp knife. Turn the steak about every five minutes, and 
baste with the juice, the same as with chicken. As it begins 
to cook, add the following: One-half of a green pepper, the 



188 CHAFING DISH SPECIALTIES. 

heart of a piece of celery and a bit of parsley, all of which 
have been chopped fine. Also, some stuffed olives and some 
mushrooms, cut in two. Sprinkle the steak with paprika 
while cooking, and salt after taking out. Mr. Mansfield 
used to rub the dish with garlic before beginning to cook 
the steak. About twenty-five or thirty minutes are required 
for the process, but it is worth trymg.

are of creamy consistency, stirring and scraping from bot- 
tom of pan. Serve at once. 

' LARDED SWEETBREADS, SAUT6. 

Parboil and blanch the sweetbreads, and run through each 
four or five thin strips of fat salt pork. Do this with a lard- 
ing-needle, or a sharp, narrow-bladed knife, and let the ends 
of the pork project on each side. Have a tablespoon ful of 
butter in the blazer, and cook the sweetbreads in this, turn- 
ing often. Let them cook rather slowly. 

CURRIED SHRIMPS. 

One can shrimps, one tablespoonful butter, one tablespoon- 
ful flour, half teaspoonful salt, two teaspoonfuls curry pow-

brown, add the flour and curry powder, cook until they bub- 
ble and pour the boiling water upon them. Stir constantly 
and when smooth put in chutney sauce and the shrimps. 
They should cook about five minutes. 



Cheese Dishes 



CHEESE BALLS (No. 1.)

or small ones for each person, and roll in chopped pecan 
nuts. 

CHEESE BALLS (No. 2.)

salt, and cayenne. Beat the eggs to a stiff froth; stir in the 
cheese, salt, and cayenne pepper. Shape the mixture into 
balls the size of marbles, and drop them into boiling lard. 
Fry them for about five minutes till a golden brown, drain 
well, and serve with grated cheese. 

CHEESE ROULETTES.

cheese — Parmesan is preferred. Whip the whites of three 
eggs stiff and mix in the cheese. Flour the hands and mold

two ounces of bread crumbs, one ounce of butter, one tgg 
and two extra yolks, salt and cayenne, crumbs for coating, 
frying fat. 

Mix together the crumbs, cheese, warmed butter, and sea- 
soning. Then add enough beaten yolk to bind them all in a 
soft paste, but it must be sufficiently stiff to shape easily. 

Make the mixture into small balls, like large marbles. 



190 CHEESE DISHES. 

Brush these over with beaten egg, then coat them with crumbs. 
Repeat this egging and crumbing, so that they have two coat- 
ings. 

Have ready a pan of frying fat. When a bluish smoke 
rises from it put in the balls two or three at a time, and fry 
them a pretty golden brown. Drain them well on paper 
and serve them piled up on a lace paper on a hot dish. 

STUFFED CELERY. 
Take some celery stalks, one head for each person, clean

ful of Roquefort and two teaspoon fuls of cream cheese, sea- 
son with paprika, and add a pinch of finely cut chives. Stir 
until a smooth paste is formed and then put in a paper cor- 
net. Take the celery and lift leaf by leaf and squeeze the 
cheese between the celery stalks. Served on chopped ice

FROMAGE ROMANESQUE. 

"Fromage Romanesque" is enough to make an epicure's 
mouth water. It is as delicious a cheese dish as one could 
imagine. 

The cheese used in its making is the common cream or 
Neufchatel variety and two of the second sized cakes are 
used for this recipe — that is, the size we call the ten-cent 
size in this country. The other ingredients are three eggs, 
three-quarters of a cup of very thick, sour cream; five 
teaspoonfuls of clear honey and half a teaspoonful of salt. 
First, beat the cheese and sour cream together until smooth 
as paste; then add the honey and blend in carefully, then 
the salt, then the well-beaten yolks of the three eggs, and 
lastly the whites beaten stifHy. 

Beat the whole mixture vigorously for a few minutes 
and then either pour into cases of thin puff paste and bake 
twenty-five minutes in a brisk oven or bake in an oiled 
or buttered baking dish, without pastry, which makes it a 
sort of cheese souffle, which pulls far up and should be 
served with a cheese sauce made by beating together equal 
parts of thick, sweet cream and cream cheese. These 
should be first blended with a spoon and then beaten with 
an egg-beater. Sometimes sprinkle in chopped olives in 
the sauce.

CHEESE EN SURPRISE. 

The following recipe will be found most appetizing when 
served at one's dinner in place of the usual Roquefort, Neuf- 
chatel, or Camembert, and will prove extremely tasty for 
the little midnight lunches. A little time and patience are 
required in preparing it, and to some it may seem a trifle 
expensive, but I find that I can prepare enough to serve 
six people at a cost of about 40 cents. Mix thoroughly to- 
gether in a bowl one 10 cent cake of fresh cream cheese 
with one-quarter of a pound of Roquefort. Add a pinch 
of salt, a little pepper, a dash of paprika, a scant table- 
spoonful of Worchestershire sauce, a lump of butter, and a 
tablespoonful of thick rich cream. Use one green and one 
red pepper (see that these are firm and fresh) and take 
half of the green pepper and about two-thirds of the red. 
and with a 10 cent bottle of olives (stuffed ones are also 
nice for this purpose) mince all finely together, and stir 
this mixture into the cheese, seeing that it is evenly scat- 
tered throughout the cheese. Take the whole and form in 
mound shape upon an attractive cheese dish; then take the 
remaining half of the green pepper and cut in uniform 
strips, and garnish four sides of cheese. Take rest of red 
pepper, cut in star shape and place on top. When finished 
put immediately in the ice box and leave there until served. 
To those who are fond of cheese this will be a treat.

Sand 



v^iches 



To make sandwiches is a plain affair, but a good many 
do not know how to make them properly and attractively. 
If the bread is cut thin and of an equal thickness and prop- 
erly buttered and the meat free from gristle and fat, and cut 
in nice thin slices, and furthermore, the whole sandwich care- 
fully trimmed into a nice square shape and then cut diag- 
onally, served on a plate covered with a napkin, it will always 
be appreciated. When, however, one gets two chunks of 
bread with thick pieces of meat between, the butter un- 
evenly spread on the bread, it will rapidly diminish the 
appetite. 

Ham, tongue, roast beef, corned beef, lamb, chicken, veal 
and ham, and turkey sandwiches are all made in the same 
plain way, — the bread and meat cut thinly and the butter 
softened so it will spread evenly over the bread. The fresh 
meat sandwiches are seasoned with salt. With ham, tongue 
and beef a little French or English mustard may be added 
according to taste. 

CLUB SANDWICH. 

Toast two slices of bread and cover them thinly with 
mayonnaise dressing. Place two slices of chicken, white meat 
only, on one piece of toast. On top of this place one or two 
lettuce leaves and sprinkle some salt over it. Put the other 
piece of toast on top of this, and press the sandwich together 
a little and trim nicely, and cut the sandwich in two triangles. 
Serve warm if possible. 

Sometimes thin slices of broiled bacon, sliced tomatoes 
and even sliced pickles are added to the club sandwich. Bacon 
is acceptable, but if the two other articles are added the com- 
bination is superfluous.

Eggs, Omeleftes and Souffles 



GENERAL RULES. 

A stale egg rises in water; fresh eggs are heavy, and sink 
to the bottom. Wash eggs as soon as they come from the 
store. Eggs should never be boiled, as that renders them 
tough and difficult of digestion. They should be cooked just 
under the boiling point. 

STEAMED EGGS. 

Break an tgg into a buttered cup or in patent egg steamer. 
Sprinkle it with salt and pepper. Put cup or cups into a 
steamer and cook until the white is set (three to five min- 
utes). Remove carefully from cup with teaspoon. Serve 
on toast garnished with toast points. 

SOFT COOKED EGGS. 

Have the water boiling, drop in the eggs gently, and place 
on stove where they will simmer but not boil, for from five 
to eight minutes. 

HARD COOKED EGGS. 

Place the eggs in boiling water, move to a warm place, 
where they will simmer, not boil, and let cook thirty min- 
utes. Remove shells, cut in quarters lengthwise, and pour 
browned butter over them and serve hot. 

POACHED OR DROPPED EGGS. 

Fill a pan with boiling, salted water. Break eath egg into 
a wet saucer and slip it into the water; set the pan back 
where water will not boil. Dip the water over the eggs with 
a spoon. When the white is firm and a film has formed over 
the yolk, they are cooked. Take them up with a skimmer, 
drain and serve hot, on toast. Season with salt. 



206 EGGS, OMELETTES AND SOUFFLES. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS. 

3 eggs. 1-3 cup milk or water. 

Yz teaspoon salt. spk. pepper. 

1 teaspoon butter. 
Beat the eggs slightly, add the milk and seasoning. Cook 
in a hot, buttered frying pan, stirring constantly until thick. 
Serve hot. 

SHIRRED EGG. 

Butter an t.g'g shirrer or small vegetable dish, cover bot- 
tom and side with fine bread crumbs. Add an ^gg very care- 
fully, cover with seasoned bread crumbs, and bake in a slow 
oven until white is firm and crumbs are brown. 

FRIED EGGS. 

Fried eggs are cooked as buttered eggs without being 
turned. They are usually fried with bacon fat, which is taken 
by spoonfuls and poured over the eggs. Do not have the fat 
too hot as that will give the ^gg a hard, indigestible crust. 

BUTTERED EGGS. 

Melt one tablespoon of butter, slip in an ^gg and cook un- 
til the white is firm. Turn over once while cooking, and 
use just Plough butter to keep it from sticking. 

OMELET A LA PAYSANNE. 

The name of this dish, **a la paysanne" ("in the country- 
woman's style") suggests at once that it is a dish suited 
to modest households. 

The following are the quantities of materials required 
for six persons: Twelve fresh eggs, three and a half ounces 
of lean bacon cut in dice, about five ounces of butter, a 
tablespoonful of chopped chives, five ounces of potatoes 
cut in dice, salt and pepper. 

Put the bacon in a frying pan with an ounce and a half 
of butter and put on a fire not very hot. As soon as the 
bacon begins to fry add the potatoes cut in dice and let 



EGGS, OMELETTES AND SOUFFLES. 207 

them cook at a slow fire. When the potatoes are cooked 
add the chives or parsley. 

While waiting for this you must break the eggs, to 
which you add the salt and pepper necessary, taking into 
consideration the salt in the bacon. The eggs must be 
thoroughly beaten up to make a perfectly uniform liquid 
of them. Then add the bacon and potatoes. 

If you have only one frying pan at your disposal, it 
will be advisable to wipe it with a clean cloth in order 4:hat 
the omelet may not stick to the bottom. Then put the fry- 
ing pan back on a sharp fire, keeping your three and a half 
ounces of butter in reserve. As soon as the butter begins 
to take a light brown color, pour the eggs into the boiling 
butter. Shake the frying pan and stir the eggs with a fork. 
Then turn the omelet as you would a pancake. A few sec- 
onds will sufiice to finish cooking the omelet. Slip it im- 
mediately on a dish and serve at once.

spoon or a small wire whisk for five or six minutes. Take 
the whites of seven or eight eggs, put in a bowl, and beat 
to a very stiff froth. Now mix the yolks and whites together 
very carefully, so that the beaten whites keep their firm- 
ness. Then pile the mixture on a slightly buttered silver or 
metal dish, smooth it over with a knife so as to obtain a 
dome-shaped form, and bake in a very moderate oven for 
about twelve minutes or more and serve immediately. Any 
other flavor than vanilla can be substituted. Some fresh 
strawberries or similar fruit previously sugared can be 
put on the bottom of the dish. To make the omelette souf- 
fle a success two things have to be taken into consideration.

and second, that the mixing together of the whites and yolks 
of the eggs be done very carefully with a flat wooden spoon.

and whites beaten separately. Let remain but one minute 
over fire after the eggs are added. Then set well back on 
the stove. 

EGGS L'AIGLON. 

To make this delectable dish the eggs are boiled hard, as 
many as one wants. They are then cut across in halves, 
the yolks removed and a little clip cut o& each end to make 
the halves stand well. 

Then a stuffing is made from a boiled pepper, chopped 
fine, and placed in a bowl that has been rubbed hard with 
garlic. One small onion minced very fine is mixed with the 
pepper and the yolks of the eggs have been mashed with a 
little olive oil and blended into the whole with a seasoning 
of salt, a speck of mustard and a breath of celery seed. 

The boiled white parts of the egg are then brushed over 
with beaten raw whites of eggs and rolled in grated cheese

till well covered with it. The stuffing paste is then packed 
into the hollows of the eggs and piled high on top; then 
sprinkled thickly with grated cheese and paprika, and placed 
in a hot oven for about ten minutes. They are served with a 
garnish of watercress.
