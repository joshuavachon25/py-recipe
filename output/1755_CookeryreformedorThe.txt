THE 

PREFACE. 

THERE is fcarce any fubje<5t on which 
more books have been written, than 
that of COOKERY j and yet no one 
has been hitherto managed with lefs accura- 
cy, care or judgment ; fome have endea- 
voured to render their writings as bulky as 
poffible, by collecting all kinds of culinary 
materials to fwell them into feveral volumes, 
as if a man's chief bufinefs was to live to eat y 
and not to eat to live j others again have not 
been contented with plain or even ' coftly 
Englifti dimes, but have introduced various 
examples of foreign luxury, the names of 
which, though perhaps well known at nrfl, 
are now fo corrupted that they cannot be ex- 
plained or rectified by the moft copious dicti- 
onaries in any language. Thefe have been 
continued in all books of this kind, even 
in thofe mod in vogue ; in which like wife the 
good and the bad dimes have been jumbled 
together, without order or diftinction. 

But thefe objections are of fmall weight in. 
comparifon of thofe which concern our 
HEALTH, for whatever affects this is of the 
higheft importance ; fince, when this is de- 
praved, we are in effect bereaved cf every

PREFACE. 

other bleffing of life ; becaufe every other en- 
joyment without health, will be rendered alto- 
gether inflpid and ufelefs ; and yetthefe prove- 
ditors for the palate have never troubled their 
heads about it, when they gave directions to 
prepare their cullifes, their crocands and their- 
puptons j it not being an object worth their 
ferious consideration. However, the leaft at- 
tention to thofe matters will convince us, that 
fuch heterogenous mixtures muft necefiarily 
vitiate and inflame the blood, and confe- 
quently difturb and deprefs the active functi- 
ons of the body, and all the noble faculties of 
the mind. I could give various inftances to 
illuftrate this affertion, but I (hall only men- 
tion a pernicious practice, which they all re- 
commend with one voice ; I mean the ufe 
of brafs and copper veffels in pickling, to be- 
flow a beautiful colour on the vegetables to be 
preferved : this indeed will produce the in- 
tended effect, by the corrofive nature of the 
vinegar and other acids acting on the cop- 
per, and turning it into a kind of verdigreafe, 
which tinges the pickles and heightens their 
natural verdure into a bluim green. Now as 
verdigreafe is a flow poifon, it is no wonder 
the frequent ufe of fuch pickles mould pro- 
duce great alterations in the human body, 
while the caufe remains unfufpected. This 
method of reafoning is fully confirmed by 
the late prohibition of the ufe of copper vef- 
iels both in Sweden and France. 

i Few 



PREFACE. 

Few people are very fond of living up to 
the exact rules of phylic, nor is it necefTary 
they mould ; but this is no excufe for taking 
meafures that will infallibly ruin their confti- 
ons j efpecially as any man may make a deli- 
cious repaft, without making himfelf fick with 
the indigeftible gallimawfry of an injudicious 
caterer, in like manner as he may take a chear- 
ful glafs, without poifoning himfelf with the 
ftum'd wine of an avaricious vintner. 

Such confiderations as thefe have prevailed 
on me to examine fome papers that have 
been put into my hands, and to felect fuch 
materials out of them, as are moft condu- 
cive to health and pleafure, without en- 
dangering i he conftitution ; this I think fhould 
be the chief defign of thofe that write trea- 
tifes of this kind. I have like wife in the 
account of aliments, and the method of 
curing difeafes, made fuch corrections and al- 
terations, as I judged would render them of 
real ufe to the publick j and indeed there is 
fuch a natural connection between the pro- 
perties and ufe of aliments and medicine, that 
I think they are here not unfitly joined toge- 
ther ; efpecially as different conftitutions re- 
quire different aliments to correct the excefs 
of them, fo as to render life cafy. 

Now as to different conftitutions, there 
requires no g?eat fund of knowledge to be 

able 



PREFACE. 

able to diftinguifh one from another ; for we 
can fcarce help obferving, that fome perfons 
are heavy, indolent, timorous and void of vi- 
vacity ; which (hews that fuch are of a phleg- 
matic temperament ; they have likewife a pale 
foft ikin and flefh, with lank, light coloured 
hair. Thofe of a bilious conflitution are quick, 
lively and nimble in all their motions ; they 
are choleric, with ftrong pafTions 5 the habit 
of body is lean and dryj and they have ge- 
nerally reddifh curled hair. The melancholic 
are fpare, ftrong, robuft and laborious, with 
a dark complexion and black hair ; they are 
apt to be filent, abfent, grave, folitary, in- 
flexible and void of companion ; all their ac- 
tions are unpolite, they are fond of their own 
opinions, which are generally extravagant 5 
and they are always obftinate in their love and 
hatred. 7.*he fanguine are moderately corpu- 
lent, have a frefli florid complexion ; and are 
pleafant, gay, fincere, polite, modeft and 
amorous. But thefe conflitutions are feldom 
or never met with fimple and unmixt, but 
one of them generally predominates over the 
reft : hence it appears, that what may be fui- 
table and falutary to one conflitution, may be 
unfit for, or rather detrimental to another. 
This renders the ftudv of aliments more ne- 

j 

ceflary than is commonly fuppofed j and tho' 
writers of this clafs have never taken notice 
of any thing of this kind, it may rather be 
attributed to ignorance than defign ; or at 

leaft 



PREFACE. 

leaft they judged it not to belong to their pro- 
vince. 

But though authors of cookery have ne- 
glected this ufeful branch, they generally 
abound with phyfical receipts ; which it were 
to be wifhed they had entirely omitted : 
much mifchief they probably have done, but 
I am fure they never could do any good. 
Many a patient has depended upon thefe for 
relief, till the difeafe has gained ground and 
been rendered incurable ; or by the prepofte- 
rous operation of thefe incongruous medicines 
he has been hurried out of the world. 

It was therefore high time to lay down fuch 
rules and directions for the cure of difeafes, 
as will beft anfwer the end for which they 
are defigned ; fuch will not only prevent the 
ufe of improper remedies, but alfo enable 
ladies and gentlemen in the country to affift 
their poor neighbours, and often raife them 
from the jaws of death j for they are gene- 
rally destitute of any other help. For this 
reafon, the utmoft caution has been ufed that 
nothing might be recommended that would 
not probably anfwer fome valuable purpofe ; 
I fay probably, for there are many difeafes 
that will elude the force of the beft contrived 
remedies, and baffle the {kill of the moft 
able phyficians. 

The 



PREFACE. 

The directions are every where as plain as 
the nature of the fubject will admit of, and 
are fo particular, as to prevent the unfeafon- 
able exhibition of any medicine, if they are 
attended to with due care. Likewife fuch 
things are propofed as may or ought to be 
kept in every apothecary's (hop, that there 
may be no time loft in the preparation of the 
drugs upon any emergency j the neglect of 
which has been 'of confiderable detriment to 
many an unhappy patient: I mention this 
with regard to accute difeafes, which termi- 
nate in life or death in a {hort time j but as 
to chronic or tedious maladies, there will be 
time enough to procure the beft of every kind. 
With regard to acute difeafes, it would 
be well if every family would keep fome 
remedies by them, which are recommended 
in this book, becaufe they are fure to be had 
genuine at the places herein mentioned.

Of drefing BEEF. 

'To choofe BEEF. 

X-B E E F is bed ; which has ge- 
nerally a more open grain than cow- 
beef. The colour mould be carna- 
tion, and the fewet white. When 
young the flefh is fmooth and glofTy, 
and if you make a dent in it with your finger, it 
will rife again ; if old it will be rough and fpongy. 
The neck and brifcuit are more or lefs fo, both in 
young and old. Cow-beef has a ciofer grain, 
the lean is of a paler colour, and the fat more 
B white. 




2 7%e Art of Coo K E R V. 

white. Heifer-beef is next in goodnefs to the 
Ox, and eats exceeding well. The flefh of bulls 
is of a deep dufky red, feels tough when pinch- 
ed, has a rank fmell, and the fat is fkinny and 
hard ; infomuch that the butcher cannot deceive 
you if he would. The figns of youth or age 
are of little confequence, for none will buy it 
that can have better. 

To roaft BEEF. 

Beef mould never be falted before it is laid 
down to the fire, for that either deprives it of 
its gravy, or depraves the tafte ; but if it were 
neceffary to keep it a few days before it is drefs'd, 
you need only dry it well with a clean cloth, and 
then flour it all over ; which done, it muft not 
be hanged in a damp or clofe place, but where the 
air can come to it readily and freely. When you 
are about to lay it down, paper the top ; when 
it is down, bafte it well with fine dripping all 
the time it is roafting, having firft fprinkled fait 
all over it. When the fmoak or fteam of the 
meat is drawn towards the fire, take off the pa- 
per, bafte it well, and drudge it with a little 
flour to make a fine froth ; then take up the 
meat and garnifh the dim with horfe-radifh. If it 
is a final 1 piece, the fire muft be little and brifk, 
that it may be done quick and nice ; if large, the 
fire muft be proportionable, and always clear at 
the bottom. When the beef is half done re- 
move it and the dripping-pan from the fire, and 
ftir it up well to make it brifk j for a great deal 
depends on the goodnefs of the fire. A piece 
of beef of ten pounds, fuppofing the fire to be 
good, v/ill require an hour and a half; twenty 
pounds wil take three hours, when thkk, but if 

thin, 



Art of C o o K E fcy. J 

thin, two hours and a half is fufikient. Re- 
member always, that in frofty weather it muft 
be kept at the fire half an hour longer. 

I'o broil BEEF-STEAKS. 

To broil beef-fleaks properly, the fire muft 
be clear and brifk, and the gridiron very clean ; 
likewife the dilh they are to be put in muft be 
hot, by keeping it over a chafing-dim of coals 
or otherwife. The fteaks Ihould be cut about 
half an inch thick , thofe of the rump are belt. 
They fhould be fprinkled with a little pepper 
and fait, if not difliked, for fome have an aver- 
fion to pepper. Then lay them on the gridiron, 
and keep them without turning till one fide is 
done, for often turning waftes the gravy. Then 
turn them on the other fide and a fine gravy will 
foon rile to the top of the fteaks, which you 
muft endeavour to prcferve. When they are 
enough, remove them into the dim, without 
fhedding the gravy. Some like to have two or 
three fhalots or a good onion diced fine and put 
into the dim, laying the fteaks upon them. This 
done, you may put a hot cover over them and 
carry them to the table. 

To boil BEEF. 

When the beef is frefh put it into the water 
when it boils ; but as it is generally falted firft, 
it muft be put in when it is cold : After the pot 
begins to boil, allow a quarter of an hour for 
every pound of meat, and then take it up. How- 
ever, you muft remember to take off the fcum 
when it arifes ; for if it mould fink again, the 
meat will be difcoloured.

4 T'he Art of COOKERY. 

To force the infide of a Surloin of BEEF. 

When you have put the furloin on the fpit, 
take a fharp knife and carefully raife up the fkin 
and fat on the infide, after which cut out all the 
meat dole to the bone, and chop it fmall. Af- 
terwards take a pound of fuet and chop it fine ; 
as alfo about the fame quantity of crumbs of 
bread, a little thyme and lemon-peel, a little 
pepper and fait, half a nutmeg grated, and two 
fhalots chopt very fine. Mix thefe altogether 
with a glafs of red wine -, then put the mixture 
into the place the meat was taken from, and cover 
it with the fkin and fat ; let them be fkewer'd 
down with fine fkewers, and covered with 
paper. The paper is not to be taken off till the 
meat is roafted and put into the dim. Take 
two fhalots, fhred them fmall and boil them in 
a quarter of a pint of red wine, and pour it in- 
to the dim. This when mixt with the gravy 
will give it a good relifh. 

To make DUTCH-BEEF. 

Take a piece of the lean part of a raw but- 
tock of beef i rub brown fugar well into every 
part, and lay it in a pan or tray two or three 
hours, turning it feveral times ; then fait it well 
with common fait and falt-petre mixt together, 
and let it lie a fortnight, turning it every day. 
This done, roll it up in a coarfe cloth, and let 
it lie for twenty-four hours, and hang it in a 
chimney to dry. When you have occafion to 
boil it put it in a cloth. 



Art 



Toftew a Leg of BEEF. 

Wafh a leg of beef clean, and then crack it 
in two or three places, and then put it into a pot 
with a gallon of water. When it begins to boil 
take off the fcum as it arifes. Afterwards put 
in two or three blades of mace, a little bundle of 
parfly, and a good piece of bread. Let it boil 
till the finews as well as the beef are quite ten- 
der. Toaft fome bread, cut it into fmall fquare 
bits, and lay it in the difh ; then lay in the meat 
and pour the broth over it. 

70 bake a Leg of BEEF. 

Firft of all, cut and hack the beef and put it 
into a large earthen pan with a quart of ftale 
beer. To thefe add a bundle of fweet herbs, 
two onions ftuck with cloves, a piece of carrot, 
a fpoonful of black pepper, and a blade or two 
of mace. This done, cover the whole with a 
fufficient quantity of water, and tie brown pa- 
per rubb'd with butter very clofe over the top 
of the pan : then fend it to the oven and let ic 
be well baked. When it comes back, ftrain the 
meat from the gravy through a coarfe fieve, and 
lay it in a clean difh. Pick out the finews and 
fat, and put them in a faucepan with a few 
fpoonfuls of the gravy, a little red wine, a piece 
of butter rolled in flower, and fome mufrard ; 
$nd when the mixture is hot and thick it will 
ferve as fauce to the beef; difh it up and fend it 
to the table. 

The gravy may be kept in the houfe for ufe ; 

and when it is thickened with butter red wine or

This, after it is well cleaned, muft be put in- 
to the pan in the fame manner and with the

Of dreffing VEAL, 

70 roaft VEAL. 

T N roafting veal, let it lye at firft at fome 
* diftance from the fire till it is foaked : then draw 
it near to make it of a fine brown. A large 
joint muft have a good fire; a (mail piece one 
that is little and briflc. The fat of a fillet or 
loin muft be papered, to preferve it as much as 
pofiible. The breaft muft be roafted with the 
caul on till it is near enough ; and the fweat- 
bread muft be fkewer'd on its backfide. When 
jt is near enough take the caul off, bade it and 
drudge it with a little flour. Soon after any 
other joint is laid down, bafte it well with good 
butter , and when it is near enough bafte it again, 
and drudge it with a little flour. A joint of 
fix pounds will take up an hour and a half before 
it is done : One of twelve pounds three hours, 
unlefs it be thin, apd then two hours will be fuf- 
fident. 



The Art of C OOKERY. 7 

3T0 boil VEAL. 

Put the veal into the water while it is cold, 
and after it boils, allow a quarter of an hour for 
very pound j that is, a piece of four pound 
ihould boil an hour -, of fix pounds, an hour and 
a half j of eight pounds, two hours, &c. 

*To ftew a Knuckle of VEAL. 

Lay four wooden fkewers at the bottom of a 
clean pot or faucepan, and lay the knuckle after 
it is well cleaned upon them, and put it into twa 
quarts of water. To thefe add two or three 
blades of mace, a little thyme, whole pepper, 
a fmall onion, and a cruft of bread ; cover th 
pot clofe ; let it juft boil and then keep it fim- 
mering for two hours ; if it is than enough, take 
it up and lay it in a difh, ftraining the broth 
over it. 

Another 'way toftew a Knuckle of VEAL. 

Proceed as before directed ; but inftead of 
covering the pot clofe, let the water boil away till 
there is juft enough left for fauce ; then put in a 
fpoonful of catchup, a fpoonful of red wine, and 
a fpoonful of walnut pickle, as alfo fome truffles, 
and morels, or fome dry'd mufhrooms cut fmall ; 
boil all together, then take up the knuckle, lay 
it on a dim, and pour the fauce over it. 

To mince VEAL.

Of duffing MUTTON W LAMB.- 

MUTTON ^;^ LAMB. 



H E beft mutton is bred upon downs, which 
are dry and the grafs fhort ; and many are 
of opinion, that this is beft when above five 
years old, becaufe the flavour is rich and high. 
However, when mutton is young, it will pinch 
tender, and the fat will eafily part from the lean. 
The leg of weather mutton, which is beft, has 
a firing which did belong to one of the tefticles ; 
and that of ewe mutton an udder : Befides, the 
grain is clofcr, parts more eafily, and the colour 
is paler. If mutton is fweet, which you may 
know by the fcnell, it is of little confequence how 
long it is killed, forfome \vill keep a leg of mut- 
ton to choofe a week or a fortnight, becaufe 
then it will be more tender aad fuller of gravy. 
When it is defigned for mock-venifon it muft be 
always kept long. Ram-mutton, which is worft, 
has a rank fmell, a clofe grain, feels tough, and 
does not rife again when dented by the ringer ; 
the fat likewife feels fpongy : when a fheep is 
killed that has the rot, the fiem will be pale, 
and readily part from the bone. Likewife, if you 
fqueeze it hard, drops of water will appear like 
fweat ; the fat will be of a fickly palenefs, in- 
clining to yellow. 

To know whether lamb be ftale or not, you 
muft mind the eyes of a lamb's-head ; if they are 
plump and lively it is irefh killed ; if funk and 
wrinkled, ftale. Likewife fmell under the kid- 
ney of a hind quarter , if the fmell is faint and 
the knuckle limber, it is ftale. In the fore-quar- 
ter, when the neck-vein is of an azure blue it is

I'D roaft MUTTON. 

All common joints muft be roafted at a clear 
brifk fire. It muft be bafted when it is laid 
down, and muft be drudged (lightly with a little 
flour juft before it is taken up. If there is too much 
it will fpoil the tafte of the meat. The fkin muft 
always be taken off a bread of mutton j and fome 
ferve a loin in the fame manner, roafting it brown 
without paper. But a faddle, which is two loins, 
and a chine, which is two necks, muft always 
be paper'd, bafting it well while it is roafting, 
and not forgetting to fprinkle it with fait. A 
breaft of mutton may be roafted in little more 
than half an hour at a quick fire ; a fmall neck 
in the fame time ; a large neck in an hour. A 
leg of mutton of fix pounds will take an hour ; 
a moulder the fame. A fmall faddle will take 
an hour and a half; a leg of nine pounds the 
fame. A leg of twelve pounds will take two 
hours ; a large faddle three, becaufe of the pa- 
per. In frofty weather allow a quarter or half 
an hour more, according to the bignefs of the 
joint.

thin bits. Then boil the bones in a fufficient 
quantity of water with an onion, fome fweet 
herbs, a little whole pepper, a blade of mace, 
a little fait, and acruft of bread very well toafted. 
Let them boil till there is about liquor enough 
for fauce, and then ftrain it : Put this into a 
faucepan with a piece of butter rolled m fiour, 
and then add the meat. When it becomes very 
hot tts enough. Pour the ham into a difh 
wherein thin fippets of bread toafted have been

To broil MUTTON -Cnop s. 

Thefe muft not be kept on one fide till they 
are enough, like beef, but muft be turned quick 
and often ; and you muft keep the difh that they 
are to be put in hot over a charing dim of coals. 
And be fure to remember that the gridiron be 
very clean and the fire clear. 

To fluff a leg or Jhculder of MUTTON. 

Take twelve good oifters, the yolks of hard 
eggs, three anchovies, fome beef-fuet, and a 
little grated bread ; as alfo a bit of onion, pep- 
per and fait, a little thyme and winter-favoury, 
with fome grated nutmeg. Mix all thefe toge-

roajl HOUSE-LAMB. 

In roafting houfe-lamb you muft paper the 
outfide, and bafte it with good butter before a 
very quick fire. A fmall neck, breaft, or (houl- 
der, will take a little better than half an hour ; a 
leg three quarters of an hourj a fmall fore -quarter 
an hour -, and a large one an hour and a half. 

70 boil HOUSE -LAMB. 

Houfe-lamb fhould always be put in the pot 
by itfelf, with a good deal of water j and if any 
fcum arifes it muft be taken off. This method 
will make it fweeter and better than when boiled 
in cloth. With regard to the time, the rule is 
to allow a quarter of an hour for every pound. 

70 boil a kg of LAMB. 

Take care to boil it white, as above directed, 
and in about an hour's time it will be enough. 
Cut the loin into {leaks, dip them in crumbs 
of bread mix'd with egg, and fry them nice and 
brown. Boil a good deal of fpinnage in another 
vefiel, and put it in the dim ; place the leg in 
the middle and the fpinnage all round. Then 
cut an orange in four pieces to garnifh the difh. 
Put melted butter into a cup. 

70 drcfs a LAMB'S-HEAD. 

A lamb's head muft be firft boiled till it and 
the pluck is tender ; but care muft be taken 
that the liver is not overdone ; to prevent which 
it muft be taken up before the reft. When the 
head is enough hack it with a knife crofs and 
7 crofs ;

crofs ; after which, grate fome nutmeg over ic 
and lay it in a difh before a good fire. Then 
take fome grated crumbs of bread, fome fweet 
herbs rubb'd fmall, a little lemon-peel chopt 
fine, a very little pepper and fait ; mix them to- 
gether and drew it over it, and then bafte it 
with a little butter , then throw a little flower 
over it, andjufl before it is taken up bafte it and 
drudge it. Take half the liver, the lights, the 
heart, and tongue -, chop them very fmall, and 
fhake fome flour over the meat ; ftir them to- 
gether, and then put in fix or eight fpoonfuls of 
g; avy or water, a good piece of butter roll'd in 
flour, and the liquor that runs from the head 
into the dim , fimmer all together for a few mi- 
nutes, and add half a fpoonful of vinegar be- 
fore you put it into the difh. Lay the head in 
the middle of the minc'd meat, and the other 
half of the liver round the head cut thin, with 
fome rafhers of bacon broil'd. Garnifh the dilh 
with lemon. 

To drefs PORK, PIG, and HAMS. 

HGW to cheofe PORK. 
HEN pork is young the rind will be thin, 



and you may make a dent in it with your 
nails. Likewife the fat will be foft and pulpy, and 
in a manner like'lard. When pork is old the rind 
will be thick, nor can you nip it with your nails. 
Likwife the lean will feel tough, the fat flabby, 
fpongy and rough to the touch. The flefh of a 
boar or hog gelded at full growth, will be red- 
difli, hard, tough, and of a rank f'mell ; the fat 
will be ikinny and hard j the fkin very thick and 

tough, 



i6 I'&e Art of COOKERY. 

tough, falling again immediately when pinch'd 
with the fingers. To know whether it is dale or 
not, put a ringer under a bone that flicks out, 
between it and the flefh, and then fmell it ; for 
the ftrong fmell will foon difcover its being dale. 
Befides, the rind will be fweaty and clammy. 
But if it be fmooth and dry it is frefh killed. 
Meafly pork has kernels in the fat like large fhot. 
It is very unwholefome. 

To roaft PORK. 

There is no meat requires more reading than 
pork ; for if it be under done it difagrees with 
the domach. It is common to cut the fkin of 
the loin and leg crofs-ways, to make it eat more 
crifp and brittle ; and it is then called by fome 
the crackling crud. Though fome think the leg 
will eat better if it is not cut. The bed way 
to road a leg of pork is to parboil it 6rd, and 
then to take the fkin off and road it. It 
mud be baded with butter. Take a little fage 
and Hired it very fine, a little pepper and fait, a 
little grated nutmeg, and fome grated bread 1 ; 
throw a little at a time of this over it all the while 
it is reading. The crumbs that drop from it 
into the pan, mould be mix'd with fome made 
gravy, and put into the dim that the pork is to 
belaid in. A fpring, or hand of pork, when ve- 
ry young, mould be roaded like a pig, and then 
it is good eating ; otherwife it is bed boiled. 
The fparerib mould be baded with a bit of but- 
ter, a little fage fhredded fmall, and a dud of 
flour. Pork grifkins are likewife bed when road- 
eel, and baded with butter, crumbs of bread, 
and a little pepper and fait. Apple fauceis ufed 
with fpareribs. Nothing is requir'd for grifkins 
but mudard. A joint of eight pounds will 

take 



Art 0f COOKER v. 17 

ake upwards of two hours, unlefs it be thin, 
and then two hours will do it. Obferve the 
fame proportion in the reft. 

70 roaft a lorn of PORK with onions. 

Take a fure-loin of pork, and roaft it in the 
common way : Then take a quarter of a peck of 
onions, and let them be peeled, fliced, and put 
into the dripping-pan, that the fat may drop on 
them while the pork is roafting. When the 
pork is near done, take the onions up and put 
them into a faucepan ; let them fimmer over the 
fire a quarter of an hour, fhaking them well ; 
then pour out as much of the fat as you can, 
and fhake in a little flour, adding a fpoonful 
of vinegar and half a fpoonful of muftard ; ftir 
them together and fet the faucepan over the fir 
for four or five minutes. Lay the pork in a dilh 
and put the onions in bafons. 

70 rcaft a PIG. 

Before the pig is laid down to the fire, take a 
little fage fhredded fmall, a bit of butter of 
the fize of a walnut, with a little pepper and 
fait ; put thefe into the infide of the pig, and 
fow up the belly with coarfe thread. The fire 
fhould burn fiercer at each end than in the mid- 
dle ; or, which will anfwer the fame end, hang 
a flat iron on the middle of the grate. When 
you lay the pig down flour it all over very well ; 
this muft be repeated all the time till the pig is 
roafted ; that is, till the eyes drop out, or the 
fkin becomes crifp and hard. When the gravy 
begins to run, fet bafons or pans in the dripping- 
pan to catch it. When you think the pig is 
enough ftir up the fire to make it brifk. Then 
take a coapfc cloth, with a quarter of a pound of 
C butter 



1 8 The Art of COOKERY. 

butter wrapt in it, and rub the pig all over, and 
before all the crackling becomes crifp ; then take 
it up. After it is laid in the difh, cut off the 
head with a fharp knife, before the fpit is drawn 
out, and in this manner let the pig be cut in two. 
Cut the ears off the head and lay one at each 
end-, cut the under jaw in two, and lay one part 
on one fide and the other on the other. Take 
the gravy that was faved and put it into fome 
good melted butter ; boil them together, and 
put the brains in, bruifed fine ; then mix them 
with the fage and fend the difh to the table. 

The time a pig will take in roafting, if juft: 
killed, is an hour. If it was killed the day be- 
fore, it will take an hour and a quarter. If a 
very large one, an hour and a half. 

20 bake a PIG. 

Sometimes it may be inconvenient to roaft a 
pig -, and therefore it will be neceffary to know 
how to bake one. After having put fome fage 
in the belly, according to the directions for roaft- 
ing a pig, lay it in a dim, rub it over with but- 
ter, and flour it well ; likewife butter the difh 
and put it into the oven. When it is enough 
draw it to the oven's mouth, and rub it over 
with a cloth that has butter in it. Then return 
it into the oven till it is dry , take it out and lay 
it in another difh, and cut it up. Take the fat 
off the difh that it was bak'd in, and there will 
be fome good gravy at the bottom. Take this 
and mix it with a little veal gravy, and a little 
piece of butter roll'd in flour. Let the mixture 
juft boil, and then pour it into a difh to the brains 
and fage that was in the belly.

To boil a HAM. 

Put the ham into the copper or pot, and en- 
creafe the fire very (lowly, fo that it may conti- 
nue there three or four hour, before it boils, and 
take off the fcum as often as it rifes. A fmall 
ham may be kept in an hour and a half after 
the pot begins to boil ; but if a large one, it 
will take two hours. 

'To pickle PORK. 

Take a proper part of a hog that has been 
fed fat enough for bacon, and take out the bones ; 
cut it into pieces of a fize fit to lie in a pan or 
tub ; rub them over well with falt-petre. Then 
take two parts of common fait, and one of bay 
fait, and rub them well over again. This done, 
put a layer of fait at the bottom of the tub, and 
a piece of pork over it ; then another layer of 
fait, and then another piece, and fo on ; cover- 
ing the whole with fait, and thrufting it to the 
vacant place on the fides of the tub. As the 
fait melts on the top, fill on more, that it may 
be always covered. Then lay a cloth over the 
tub, and a board over that , laying a weight on 
the board to keep it down. Thus managed, it 
will keep above a year. 

To boil pickled PORK. 

Pickled pork muft not be put into the pot till 
the water boils ; and then a middling piece will 
take an hour before it is enough. if a very 
large piece, it muft boil an hour and a half, or 
two hours. But remember not to boil it too 
long, for it will turn to a jelly.

To dreft PIG'S Petty -Toes. 
Into half a pint of water, put a little whole 
pepper, a blade of mace, a bundle of fweet herbs, 
and an onion. Then put in the petty-toes, and 
let them boil five minutes. After this, take out 
the liver, lights, and heart, and mince them ve- 
ry fine ; grate a little nutmeg over them, and 
fhake on a little flour. Let the feet continue in 
the faucepan till they are tender ; then take them 
out and ftrain off the liquor; Put all thefe to- 
gether into the faucepan, with a bit of butter 
of the fize of a walnut, and a little fait ; let them 
fimmer five or fix minutes, making the fauce- 
pan often ; pour the liquor and minced meat in- 
to the middle of the difh, wherein toafted fip- 
pets are laid. The petty-toes muft be flit, and 
laid round the minced meat. Some add the juice 
of half a lemon, or a very little vinegar. 

To choofe Weflphalia HAMS. 

There is a bone which flicks out of the broad 
end of the ham, between which and the flefli 
if you run a knife, and it comes out tolerable 
clean, with an agreeable flavour, the ham is 
good ; but if the knife comes out fmeared, and 
dull, the ham is either rufty or tainted. 

To choofe Englifli HAMS, GAMMONS, and 
BACON. 

Hams and gammons may be tried in the 
fame manner as the former ; or an iron fcewer 
may be thruft into the middle of them ; and if 
it fmells well and fweet when taken out the meat 
is good. As for bacon, if the fat is white, and 
feels oily, without crumbling or breaking -, and 
if the flefli (licks well to the bone, keeping of 

a good 



Art of COOKERY. 2r 

a good colour, it is good. But when the lean 
has ftreaks of yellow, it is growing rufty, 

To make Bacon HAMS. 

Take a pound of fait, a pound of coarfe fu- 
gar, and an ounce of falt-petre ; mix them all 
together and rub them on your ham. It muft 
lie a month in this pickle, and be turned and 
bafted every day. Then hang it in a chimney, 
where there is nothing made 'but wood fires, 
where no damp or wet can come near it. It 
muft not hang againft a wall. Some after this 
hang it in a damp place till it is mouldy, that 
it may eat fine and ihort. 

To make BACON. 

Take the fide of a hog fed for this pnrpofe 
and lay it on a long board or drefler. Then 
take off all the infide fat, and let the blood drain 
away. After this, rub it with good fait on both 
fides, and let it lie in this manner for a week. 
Then take a quarter of a peck of common fait, 
a pint of bay-falt, two pints of coarfe fugar, a 
quarter of a pound of falt-petre beaten fine, and 
mix them together. Lay your flitch in fome- 
thing that will hold the pickle, and rub it well 
with the above mixture. Lay the fkinny fide 
downwards, and bade it with the pickle every 
day for a fortnight. Then hang it in wood fmoak, 
as you did the ham to dry ; and afterwards in a 
cool place, where no damp or wet can come 
near it. 

To roaft a HAM, or Gammon of BACON. 

Take off the fkin or rind off the ham or gam- 
mon, and lay it in water lukewarm for two or 
three hours. Then put it in a pan, and pour a 
C 3 quart 



22 *fbe Art of COOKERY. 

quart of canary or fack over it, and let it deep 
for twelve hours, or thereabout. This done, put 
it on a fpit, and cover the fat fide with fheets of 
paper. Pour the canary in which the ham was 
ibaked, into the dripping-pan, with which it 
muft be balled all the time it is roafting. When it 
is roafled enough take off the paper, and drudge 
it well with grated bread and parfley, cut very fine. 
Let the fire be made to burn brifk and fierce- 
ly, that the ham may be made of a fine brown. 
Jf it is to be eaten hot, garnim it with rafpings 
of bread ; if cold, ferve it on a clean napkin, 
and garnim it with parfley.

tember till the end of December or January. 
When the clefts of the hoofs are wide and tough 
it is old i when clofe and fmooth it is young. The 
fweetnefs of venifon maybe generally difcovered 
by the fmell : but if you would be more certain, 
put ycur finger or knife under the bone that 
fticks out cr" the haunch, or moulder, or the 
moft flefliy parts of the fides ; and if the fmell 
is fweet, it is good, if rank, bad. Befides, 
when it begins to taint, fome parts will look 
greenim, or more than ordinarily black, 

'To roaft VENISON. 

Take a haunch of venifon and put it on the 
fpit \ then roll four meets of white paper about 
it, well tutter'd -, tie the paper on with a fmall 

ftring,

firing, and bafte the haunch well all the time it 
is roafting. Take care that the fire be very good 
and brilk ; and then it will be fufficiently done 
in two hours ; if the haunch be fmall, an hour 
and a half; if large, two hours and a half. 
When it is enough take off the paper, and drudge 
it a little to make a froth. But you muft be as 
quick as you can, to prevent the fat from melt-- 
ing and dripping away. Put fome very good 
gravy in a boat or bafon, and fweet fauce in an- 
other. A neck and moulder muft be roafted in 
the fame manner, and will take an hour and a 
half. 

To keep VENISON fweet l , and to recover it when 
tainted. 

To keep venifon fweet, you only need to wipe 
it clean with a dry cloth, and hang it in a place 
where the air can come to it freely. If it is 
neceffary to keep it a confiderable time, then it 
will be proper to rub it very wel] with dry clean 
cloths, and to rub it all over with beaten or 
powder'd ginger, hanging it in an airy place as 
before. When it is mufty, or fmells ftrong,

To ctrefs HARES and RABBITS. 

To choofe HARES and RABBITS. 
Hare is of a pale colour, and ftiff, when lately 
killed , but the flefh is generally blackifh, 
and the body limber, when ftale. If the cleft 
of the upper lip fpreads very much, and the 
claws are wide afunder and ragged, it is old ; but 
the contrary, if young. A leveret may be known 
by a knob in the fore-leg, that may be difcover- 
cd by feeling j which a grown hare has not. Be- 
fides, the ears of a young hare wiil tear eafily ; 
but the contrary when old. A frefh rabbit is 
white and ftiff, a ftale one flimy and limber. 
"When young, the claws and fur will be fmooth ; 
but when old, the claws will be long and 
rough. 

To roaft a HARE. 

Before the hare is laid down, it will be ne- 
ceflary to make a pudding in the following man- 
ner. Take a quarter of a pound of grated bread, 
as much fuet, two eggs, and an anchovy fhred- 
ded fmall ; as alfo a little parfley Ihredded fmall, 
as much thyme as will lie on a fixpence when 
fhredded fmall ; fome nutmeg, a very little pep- 
per and fait, and a little lemon- peel. Mix all 
thefe well together, and put the mixture into the 
hare. Then fow up the belly of the hare, fpit 
it, and lay it down to a good fire. Put two 
quarts of milk and half a pound of butter into 
a clean dripping-pan, and bafte it with the but- 
ter and milk all the time it is roafting, till the 
whole is foak'd up ; by which time the hare will 
be enough. Some like to have the liver mix'd

with the pudding ; in which cafe, it mufl be firft 
parboiled, and then chopp'd fine. 

5T0 roaft RABBITS. 

When the rabbits are laid down to the fire, 
they muft be bafted with good butter, and 
drudg'd with a little flour. Make them of a 
fine light brown. When the fire is quick and 
clear, very fmall rabbits will be done in twenty 
minutes -, others in half an hour. The livers 
muft be boiled with a little bunch of parfley, and 
then chop them together till they are fine. Then 
melt fome good butter, and put half the liver 
and parfley therein ; pour it into the difh. Then 
take the other half, and with it garnifh the 
difh. 

To roaft a RABBIT Hare-fafltion. 

To perform this properly, it muft be firft 
larded with bacon, and roafted in the fame man- 
ner as a hare. It will require gravy fauce. If 
it is roafted without larding, it will be neceflary 
to have white fauce. 

70 jugg a HARE. 

Cut the hare into fmall pieces, and feafon them 
with a very little pepper and fait. Then put 
them into an earthen jugg or jar, with an onion 
ftuck with cloves, a blade or two of mace, with 
a bundle of fweet herbs. Cover the mouth of 
the jugg or jar, fo clofe that nothing can get in 
or out ; and then fet it in a pot of boiling water, 
which muft be kept boiling for about three hours, 
and then the hare will be enough. Pour the 
whole into a dilh, take out the onion and fweet 
herbs, and fend it to the table hot.

with cloves, a bundle of fweet herbs, and a nut- 
meg cut to pieces. As alfo fome whole pep- 
per, and a blade or two of mace; pour on 
enough water to cover the whole ; then put the 
lid on the ftew-pan, and let it flew till the hare 
is tender, but not fo as to overdo it. Then take 
out the hare with a fork, and flrain the liquor 
through a coarfe fieve. When the pan is quite 
emptied, put the hare in again with the liquor, 
a bit of butter of the fize of a walnut roll'd in 
flour, one fpoonful of catchup, and another of 
red wine ; ftew all thefe well together with a 
few pickled mumrooms, till the liquor is thick 
and fmooth ; then put all out into a dim, and 
fend it to the table. 

To boil RABBITS. 

Let the rabbits be trufs'd in a proper manner 
fit for boiling, put them into a pot by themfelves, 
and keep them there till they are enough. For 
fauce take the livers, boil them and Hired them 
fine. To thefe add parfley fhredded fine, capers 
chopt fmall, half a pint of good gravy, a glafs 
of white wine, a little powder of mace, and 
grated nutmeg , a little pepper and fait, and a 
bit of butter of the fize of a nutmeg roll'd in 
flour. Boil all thefe together till the liquor is 
thick , then take up the rabbets and pour the

them into dices, and boil them in milk and wa- 
ter, fkimming the liquor ; they will take about 
half an hour. This done, throw them into a 
fieve to drain off the liquor, chop them fmall, 
and put them in a faucepan ; then make in a

Firft boil the neats-tongues till they are ten- 
der, then peel them clean and cut them into thin 
dices, which muft be fried with frefh butter. 
This done, pour the butter out, and put in as 
much gravy as will be wanted for fauce. Then 
add a bundle of fweet herbs, an onion, fome 
pepper and fait, and a blade or two of mace. Let 
them fimmer all together for half an hour ; after 
which, take out the tongue, and ftrain the gra- 
vy ; then put the tongue into the ftew-pan again. 
Take a glafs of white wine, the yolks of two eggs, 
a bit of butter of the fize of a walnut rolPd in

thefe carrots and turnips in flices, with a piece of 
butter roll'd in flour. Stew all together foftly 
over a flow fire for two hours, adding more gra- 
vy, when neceflfary. This done, pour all into a 
dim, take out the fweet herbs and fpices, and 
fend it to the table. The turnips and carrots 
may be left, or they may be boiled by them- 
felves, and afterwards put into the difh. 

To fry TRIPE. 

Let the tripe be cut into pieces about three 
or four inches long ; then dip them into a mix- 
ture made with yolks of eggs and grated bread. 
Put them into a pan, and fry them till they are 
of a fine brown ; afterwards take them out and 
lay them on a difh to drain. Remove them in- 
to a hot difh, and fend them to the table with 
butter and muftard mixt in a cup. 

To Jlew TRIPE.

ly as you can, fo as not to difturb the mixture, 
and keep it together with fine packthread tied 
round it. This done, put it on the fpit, and 
while it is roafting bafte it with butter. When 
you think it is done lay it in the difh. The

To drefs TURKEYS, FOWLS, 
CHICKENS, and PHEASANTS. 

To choofe POULTRY. 

V\7 H E N a cock-turkey is young, his legs 
will be black and fmooth, and his fpurs 
fliort. When frefh killed, the eyes will be frefh 
and lively, and the feet limber ; but if ftale, the 
eyes will be funk in the head, and the feet dry. 
When a turkey-hen is with egg, her vent will 
be foft and open ; but if otherwife, clofe and 
hard. 

A right capon may be known by a fat vein on 
the fide of the breaft, the comb is pale, and 
the rump thick : befides, if he is young, the 
legs will be fmooth and the fpurs (hort. When 
he is lately killed, his vent will be hard and clofe ; 
if ftale, loofe and open. The fpurs of a young 
cock will be (hort and dubbed. But take care 
you are not deceived by their being pared and 
fcraped. The legs and comb of a young hen 

will

wilt be fmooth , of an old one, rough. When 
either is lately killed, the vent will be clofe ; if 
ftale, loofe and open. 

jT<? roaft a TURKEY. 

"When you lay a turkey down to the fire, 
take care to finge it well with white paper; 
bafte it with butter and drudge it with flour. 
When it looks plump, and the fmoke begins 
to draw towards the fire, bafte it again ; then 
drudge it with a little flour, froth it up, and then 
it is done. It will be proper to paper the bread 
after it is fmged, and t take it off before you 
froth it up. A very good fire will roaft a fmail 
turkey in three quarters of an hour ; a middling 
one in an hour, and a large one in an hour and 
a quarter. Some like a turkey larded. 

70 roaft FOWLS and CHICKENS. 

There is no difference in the method of roaft - 
ing turkeys and thefe, only the breaft need not 
be paper'd. A quick and clear fire will roaft 
fmall chickens in twenty minutes, a middling 
fowl in half an hour, and a large one in three 
quarters. 

Another way to roaft a TURKEY. 

Take a turkey, loofen the fkin of its breaft 
and fill it with forced meat ; then lay it down 
to the fire, finge and paper it as before ; roaft 
it till it is of a fine brown ; and when it is near 
enough, take the paper off. The forced meat is 
made thus : Take a quarter of a pound of grated 
bread, as much beef fuet, or, for want of it 
butter, an anchovy, a little lemon-peel, nutmeg, 
parfley, and thyme ; mix, chop, and beat them 

all 



32 tfbe Art of COOKER Y. 

all together with the yolk of an egg, and then 
the fluffing is done. 

To broil CHICKENS. 

The chickens mufl be flit down the back and 
opened, fo that they will lye flat ; then feafon 
them with pepper and fait, and lay them over 
a clear fire at fome diitance from each other. 
The infide mult be laid next the fire at firft. 
till it is above half done ; then turn them and 
lay the flefhy fide next the fire, but take care 
it don't burn. When it is pretty near done, 
throw fome rafpings of bread over it, which 
muft be made brown without burning. The 
difh mtifl be garnifhed, with the livers broiled, 
and the gizzards cut, flafh'd, and broiled, with 
pepper and fait ; as alfo with lemon. 

Tofiew CHICKENS. 

Cut two good chickens into quarters, and 
when they are clean warned put them into a 
faucepan, with half a pint of red wine, a quar- 
tern of water, an onion, a bundle of fweet herbs, 
fome pepper, mace, and a few rafpings ; cover 
them clofe and let them flew half an hour ; then 
roll a piece of butter of the fize of an egg in 
flour, and put it into the reft ; cover the fauce- 
pan clofe for five or fix minutes, and make it 
about ; then take out the herbs and onion, and 
they are done. Garnifh with lemon. 

An agreeable method of flewlng CHICKENS or 
FOWLS. 

The method of performing this, is to boil 

the chickens or fowls till they are half done ; 

then put them in a pewter difh and cut them up, 

feparating all the joints one from another -, the 

2 breaft- 



Art of COOKIE &r. 33 

breaft-bofjes fhould be taken quite out. Put a 
little of the water that the fowls were boiled in 
into the difh, that there may be enough to ftew 
them in, with a blade of mace, and a little fait; 
then cover it with another dim, and fet it over a 
ftove or a chafing-difh of coals. Stew the chickens 
or fowls till they are enough \ and then fend them 
to the table in the fame dim. 

To make u brown fricafee of CHICKENS. 

Tr.ke off the fkin from the chickens and cut them 
into fmall pieces ; then rub them over with yolks of 
eggs. Take grated bread, a little powder of mace, 
and grated nutmeg ; mix tjiem all together and roll 
the pieces of chickens in the mixture. Put a little 
butter into the ftew-pan, and when it is melted put 
in the pieces of chicken. Take care to keep them 
ftirring enough to prevent them flicking to the bot- 
tom of the pan ; and when they are fried of a fine 
brown pour the butter from them ; then pour in 
half a pint of gravy, a glafs of red wine, a few 
mumrooms, or two fpoonfuls of the pickle, a little 
fait, and a piece of butter roll'd in flour. When 
the liquor is thick enough, pour the fricafee into 
a dim and fend it to the table. 

A white fricafee of CHICKENS. 

Take a couple of chickens and fkin them as be- 
fore , then put them in warm water to draw out 
all the blood ; afterwards put them in a clean cloth 
to dry. Mix fome milk and water and put it into 
the ftew-pan with the pieces of chicken, Hewing 
them till they are tender. Then put half a pint of 
cream and a quarter of a pound oi 1 butter into a clean 
faucepan, and ftir them together all the time, till 
the butter is melted ; otherwife they will be greafy. 
Take the chickens out of the ftew-pan with a fork, 
and put them into the faucepan to the butter and

cream. Afterwards add a few mumrooms, a little 
powder of mace, and a very little grated nutmeg. 
Shake all together for a minute or two, and then 
put them in a dim. Rabbits may be fricafeed in the 
fame manner. 

To choofe PHEASANTS. 

A cock pheafant has dubb'd fpurs when young; 
but if he is old they are fharp and fmall. The hen 
pheafant has fmooth legs if young, with flefh of a 
fine grain ; if old the legs and fkin are more rough. 
When me is with egg the vent will be foft and open, 
if otherwife clofe. The cock, when frefh killed, 
has a faft vent, when dale, it is open and flabby. 
The fame marks difcover whether a hen is frefh or 
dale ; unlefs me is with egg, which may be eafily 
known. 

To roaft PHEASANTS. 

When you have two pheafants, fmge anoT lard 
one with bacon ; but let the other remain as it is, 
except fmging of it, for that mult be always remem- 
bered. Paper them on the bread, and when they 
are almoft enough, flour and bade them with 
a little very good butter ; and take care that the 
froth looks fine and white. Then take them up, 
and pour fome good gravy in the dim, and let there 
be good gravy befides. 

When you have but one pheafant, take a fowl, as 
near the fame fize as you can, and keep the head 
on, and Jet it be trufled exactly like a pheafant, and 
turn the head in the fame manner. This done, lard 
the bread and legs with bacon. When they are 
roafted put both in a dim, and the deceit will not be 
difcovered. Obferve, however, that a black -legg'd 
fowl has much of the flavour of a pheafant. 



Art of CooKEkY. 35 

70 boll a PHEASANT. 

There needs no other direction about boiling a 
pheafant, than to allow a good deal of water, and 
to keep it boiling all the time ; which if it be fmall, 
may be half an hour, if large, three quarters of an 
hour. For fauce, flew fellery till the liquor is waft- 
ed away ; then put in a little cream and a bit of 
butter. Take up the pheafant, put it in a dim, and 
pour the fauce all over it. 

Chickens, fowls, and turkies, are to be boiled 
in the fame manner -, only a lefs or a longer time, 
according to their fize. 

To flew a PHEASANT. 

Put a pheafant into veal-gravy, and let it ftew till 
it is enough ; and care muft be taken that there is 
juft liquor enough left for fauce. Into this liquor you 
muft put artichoak bottoms parboiled, chefnuts 
roafted and blanched, with a little powder of mace, 
pepper, and fait, to feafon it ; as alto a glafs of 
white wine , and if the fauce is not thick enough, 
a piece of butter roll'd in flour. Then fqueeze in 
a little lemon-juice, and pour the fauce over the

fat goofe with the mixture. Let it lie in this 
pickle a fortnight, turning and rubbing it every 
day. Then roll it in bran, and hang it in a chim- 
ney where wood only is burnt. If you have not 
that coiiveniency, hang it in a common chimney, 
but not too near the fire. When it is well dried 
you may keep it, in a dry place, for two or three 
months, or more. When it is to be ufed, boil it 
in a good deal of water, and fcum it well.

Take a pint of water, a good thick piece of bread, 
fome whole pepper, and a blade or two of mace ; 
boil them for five or fix minutes, or till the bread

difh of coals for four or five minutes, and it will 
be done. 

'To cboofe SNIPES and WOODCOCKS. 

The difference between a fnipe and a woodcock 
is chiefly in the fize, the former being lefs than the 
latter. When they are fat they feel thick and 
hard ; the contrary when lean. If frefh killed, 
they are limber- footed , if ftale, they are dry- 
footed. When a thick matter proceeds from their 
noftrils, or rheir throats are muddy, they are good 
for nothing. 

To roaft SNIPES or WOODCOCKS. 

Snipes and Woodcocks muft be put on a fmall 
bird fpit. Then they muft be floured and bafted 
with butter. About twenty minutes will roaft 
them. Before they are laid down there muft be a 
flice of bread ready toafted till it is brown -, place it 
under the fnipes to receive the dripping, and when 
they are enough, take them up, and lay them on 
the toaft. If there ate two fnipes take a quarter of 
a pint of hot beef gravy, pour it into the dim, and 
fet it over a chafing-difli of coals for two or three 
minutes. Garnim with lemon. 

To boil SNIPES or WOODCOCKS. 

Thefe are beft boiled in beef gravy made in the 
following manner. Take two quarts of water, 
and put into it a pound of beef cut into fmall 
pieces, with a bundle of fvveet herbs, an onion, 
ilx cloves, fome whole pepper and a blade or two of 
mace. Cover the fauce-pan clofe, and let it boil till 
half the water is wafted > then take it off, and

flrain it ; put the drained liquor back into the 
fauce-pan with- a little fait ; gut the fnipes [ but 
take care not to lofe the guts ] and put them into 
the gravy. Cover the fauce-pan clofe, and in ten 
minutes they will be enough, if they are conftantly 
kept boiling. While this is doing, chop the guts 
and the liver fmall, and flew them with a little of 
the gravy the fnipes are boiling in, with a blade of 
mace. Take as much crumb of bread as the in- 
fide of a ftale roll, made fmall, and fried in frefh 
butter till they are of a light brown. Let them 
ftand ready in a plate before the fire. When the 
fnipes are done, take half a pint of the liquor they 
were boiled in, two fpoqnfuls of red wine, and a 
bit of butter of the fize of walnut rolled in flour ; 
put them into a fauce-pan with the guts, and fhake 
it often till the butter is melted i then put in the 
crumbs and give the fauce-pan another make. This 
done, take up the fnipes, Jay them in a dim and 
pour the fauce over them.

neck end mould be tied clofe, that nothing run out: 
Then run fkewers through their legs, and hang 
them on the hooks of a little hanging- fpit, of which 
there are generally fix. Tie one end of a firing 
or pack-thread to the upper part of the fpit, and 
faften the other end to the chimney in fuch a man- 
ner that the pidgeons may not touch the bars of 
the grate while they are roafting. About fifteen 
minutes will do them with the gravy in. Melt a 
very little butter and put in the dim ; then take 
up the pidgeons very cautioufly, that no liquor be 
fpilr, and their own gravy mixing with the butter 
wiU afford liquor enough. 

Another way to roajl PIDGEONS. 

Shred parfely fine and put fome into the belly 
of the pidgeons, with a bit of butter of the fize of 
a walnut, and a little pepper and fait. Then put 
them on a very fmall fpit, and tie both ends clofe. 
Bafte them with butter, and when they are enough, 
lay them in a dim. They will fwim in gravy. 

To broil PIDGEONS, 

Split the pidgeons and flrew a little pepper and

clear fire, and when they are enough take them up. 
Put melted butter in a cup. Or you may prepare 
them in the above manner as for roafting, and'then 
broil them whole, taking care they don't burn. 

To boil PIDGEONS. 

Pidgeons mould always be boiled by themfelves 
for about fifteen minutes, and then they will be

ro drefs FISH. 

To cboofe FISH. 

H E fremnefs of fifh is generally known by the 
gills and the eyes. When the gills are of a 
lively red and have a good fmell, you'may conclude 
they are new, efpecially if the eyes are full and 
not funk in the head, nor faded ; for then they are 
ftale. Another fign is the ftiffnefs of the fifh, par- 
ticularly with regard to mackrel and herring ; for 
if their tails are limber, their eyes faded, funk and 
wrinkled, they are ftale. 

A cod mould be always thick towards the head, 
and the flefh white when cut. It is not neceflary 
a large fcate mould be frefh caught, for it eats bet- 
ter when kept fome days. Thofe turbuts are beft 
that are thick and plump, with a cream-coloured 
belly. For if it be thin and the belly of a bluifh- 
white, it will not eat firm. Soals likewife mould 
be ftiff and thick, with their bellies of a cream co- 

E 3 lour, 



54 72?t' ^t of C o o K E R Y. 

lour. Flounders and plaice fhould be ftifT, with full 
eyes : but if they are limber and their eyes are dull 
and funk, they are bad. The flelh of flurgeon 
fhould be of a clear white and not crumble when 
cut; where any veins and griftles appear they fhould 
be blue. 

The fcales of pickled- falmon mould be ftiffand 
filming , the flefti feel oily and part in flakes, without 
crumbling or appearing fpongy. Pickled herring 
when opened on the back to the bone mould have 
their fleili white,(leek,and oily. Red-herrings mould 
be gloffy, part readily from the bone and fmell well. 
Dried-ling is bed when thick at the poll and the 
rlefh yellow. 

Boiled-lobfters fhould be heavy, without water in 
the body, vyith a ftifftail \\hich fhuts as if it had a 
fpring. A cock-lobfter has a narrow tail ; that of a 
hen-lobfter is broad. Prawns, craw fifh and mrimps, 
may be chofen in the fame manner as lobfters. 

General rules to be olferved in dreffmg of FISH. 

When the fifh are to be fry'd, they muft be dry'd 
very well with aclean cloth, and after wards flour'd. 
Then put beef dripping, or hogs-iard into a very 
clean ftew-pan, and let it boil before you put in 
the fifh. Then fry them quick till they are of a 
fine light brown* but not deeper. Turn them with 
a fifh (lice ; and when they are enough, take them 
up, and put them in a dim with a coarfe cloth over 
it to foak up the fat. When you fry parfley it 
rnuflbedone quick, and taken out of thedifh as foon 
as it is crifp, otherwife the colour will be fpoiled. 
Roach, dace, fmelts, and the like, mould be fry'd 
as dry as poffible. Then put plain butter in a cup 
and garnifh with lemon. 

Ail the fauce that is required for boiled falmon, 

is 



The Art ff COOKERY. 55 

is likewife plain butter; garnifh with horfe-radifh 
and lemon. When you boil any fort of fifh, except 
mackrel, you muft put a good deal of fait and 
horfe-radifh into the water. When mackrel is tobe 
boiled, put mint, parfley, fennel, and fait into the 
water, which muft be afterwards chopt to mix 
with the butter. In general, fifh mull be well 
boiled, but great care muft be taken that they don't 
break. 

When you bake fifh, butter the pan and lay a 
very little water in tbedifh. Throw fait and flour 
over them, and lay them in the pan. Then ftick 
bits of butter, or dripping upon them, and put in 
an onion and a bundle of fweet herbs. I. et them be 
baked of a fine light brown, and when they arc 
enough, lay them on a dim before the fire. Skim 
ofTalTthe fat from the liquor in the pan, and then 
flrain the latter, which muft be mixt either with 
the fifh fauce, or ftrong foop or catchup.

the mixture ; and then they will be currant cheefe^ 
cakes. If you take half a pound of mackaroons, 
inftead of the Naples bifcuits, they will be mack- 
aroon-cheefe-cakes. If you add tincture of faffron, 
enough to give them a high colour, they are called 
faffron-cheefe-cakes. 

To make LEMON-CHEESE-CAKES. 

Pare off the outfide peel of two large lemons, 
boil it till it is tender, pound it well in a mortar, 
with a quarter of a pound of loaf fugar, half a 
pound of frefh butter, and the yolks of fix eggs. 
When they are well mixt together, cover patty- 
pans with puff-pafte, fill them half full, and bake 
them for half an hour. 

To make ORANGE-CHEESE-CAKES. 

Take the outfide-peel of two oranges, and boil 
them in two or three waters, to take out the bit- 
ternefs, and then proceed in the fame manner as in 
making the lemon-cheefe-cakes.

To make HARTSHORN GELLY, 

Take a fauce-pan that is well tin'd, put in three 
quarts of water, and Haifa pound of hartfhorn fhav- 
ings : fet it over the fire, let it boil till the harts- 
horn is diflblved, and till it hangs to the fpoon 
when a little of it is taken out ; ftrain the liquor 
while it is hot, and return it into the fauce-pan again, 
with a pint of Rhenifh-wine, and a quarter of a 
pound of loaf fugar : beat the whites of five eggs, 
with a whisk up to a froth, and flir them into the 
gelly, by little and little, with a fpoon, in the 
fame manner as if you were taking up liquor to cool 
it ; let it boil three minutes, and then add the juice 
of four lemons ; let it boil again a minute or two 
longer, and when it is of a fine white, and looks 
curdled, pour it into a bag made of fwan-fkin, and 
hold over a China bafon ; when it has paft through, 
pour it back again, repeating the fame till it is as 
fine as rock-water : let it run the laft time into a 
bafon that is quite clean, and with a fpoon fill your 
glafTes j when you have ufed half the gelly, throw 
fome of the outfide lemon-peel into the bafon to the 
reft ; fill the reft of the glaflfes with this, and they 
will be of a fine amber colour. The quantity of 
fugar is too little for moft palates, and fome diflike 
fo much lemon.

pf water to a quart ; when it is cold, fkim off the 
fat from the top, and take the gelly off clean from 
fettling at the bottom : put the gelly into a fauce- 
pan, with a pint of mountain wine, half a pound 
pf loaf fugar, the juice of four lemons, and the 
y/hite pf feven eggs beaten up to a froth with a

boil for a few minutes : pour it into a large fwan-fkin 
bag, and make it run quick into a bafon, which 
repeat till it runs clear. Laftly, let it run into a 
china bafon, in which is placed the yellow part of 
lemon-peel, which will give it a fine colour ; then 
with a clean fpoon fill yuur glaffes.

Take red currants freed from the ftalks, and put 
them into an (lone- ware-pan , fet it halfway into a 
kettle of boiling water, and let it boil half an hour, 
pour the currants into a coarfe hair fieve, to ftrain 
out the juice ; put it into a ftone-ware-pipkin over 
the fire, with a pound of fugar to each pint of 
juice. Let the fire be quick, and keep the liquor 
ftirring till the fugar is melted ; taking off the 
fcum as it rifes : when it is clear and fine, pour it 
into glafTes, and cover them with paper. Some 
direct this to be done in a bell-metal fkillet , but 
this is a pernicious practice, for all acids will cor- 
rode brafs, and render the compofition unwhole- 
fome. The fame may be faid of all other metals, 
for they will yield a difagreeable tafte, though no 
bad confequence fhould refult from them : even the 
glafing of earthen-pans has been diflblved by 
acids. Now, as this glafing is made of lead, it is no 
wonder that many have felt the bad effect of this 
practice : therefore, in all compofitions wherein 
acid juices, acid wines, or falts, are ufed, the 
pipkin mould be made of ftone, and the ftone-ware 
made in Staffordfhire is undoubtely the befl.

To make MUFFINS, BREAD, 

GINGER-BREAD, CAKES, 

and BISCUITS. 

70 make MUFFINS. 

TH E baking of muffins requires a round piece 
of caft iron, called a bake-flone, fmooth on 
the outfide, and placed in bricks juft like a copper : 
thefe are very common in the north of England, 
where^they live much on flat broad oat- cakes. Some 
private families have a particular contrivance to 
place them over a kitchin fire. When you have 
this conveniency to bake the muffins, take a pint 
and a half of good ale-yeaft, or barm, and pour 
water upon it ; let them ftand a night, and pour 
off the water clear the next day : then put the 
yeaft into two gallons of water only milk-warm, 
with two ounces of fait, and ftir them together for 
fome time , put this into a bufhel of fine wheat 
flour laid in a trough, and make it into light- 
dough : let it lie an hour, and it will rife and 
fwell; then take apiece of a proper fize, make it 
round, roll it in flour, flat them with a rolling-pin, 
and lay [it on the table,under a piece of flannel. That 
the iron may be heated all alike, put a brick in the 
middle of the fire, otherwife the middle of the 
flone will be too hot. Lay on the muffins, and 
when one fide changes colour a little, turn the other. 
Take care they don't burn, nor become too brown. 
When you ufe the muffins, toaft them crifp on 
both fides, then pull them open with your hand, 
and they will appear like a honey-comb ; lay on 

a 



The Art of COOKERY. 125 

a piece of butter, and clap the fides together again, 
fetting them by the fire. When the butter is melted, 
turn them upfide down : never ufe a knife. 

To make OAT-CAKES. 

Thefe are made exactly in the fame manner a 
muffins ; only when they are made into round balls 
they mud not be roll'd in flour, and then they will 
fall and fpreadofthemfelves. Likewife the wheat- 
flour muft be mixt with a certain quantity of oat- 
meal. This give them the denomination of oat- 
cakes. 

To make FRENCH-ROLLS. 

When you are about to make the bread, take a 
pint and a half of good ale-yeaft, that is not bitter ; 
put a gallon of water to it over night, and the next 
day pour it off : mix this yeaft with three quarts 
of water, and one of milk, which in the fummer 
muft be milk-warm, in the winter fcalding hot : 
break a quarter of a pound of butter into it with 
your hand, and add a little fait : then beat up two 
eggs in a bafon, and ftir them all together till the 
butter is diflblved ; mix this liquor with a peck 
and a half of flour, in the fummer a little Jefs, in 
the winter a little more. When the dough is well 
mixt, cover it with a cloth while the oven is heating, 
and then make it in rolls, and put them in a very 
quick oven ; let them lie a quarter of an hour on 
one fide, then turn the other, and then bake for 
another quarter of an hour : chip the outfides with 
a knife, which is better then rafping them. 

To make LIGHT- WIGS. 

Take half a pint of milk, mix it with a quarter 
of a pint of good ale-yeaft, and a pound and a half

Take a pint of good ale-yeaft, mix it with a 
little fack, and three beaten eggs, with a little nut- 
meg and fait , knead thefe with two pounds of fine 
flour, a little warm, and lay the compofition 
before the fire till it rifes light : then take a pound 
of frefh butter, and a pound of caraway comfits ; 
knead thefe all together, make buns, place them on 
floured paper, and bake them in a quick oven. 

70 make little PLUMB-CAKES. 

Dry twopounds of flour in an oven, or before the 
fire, and mix it with fix fpoonfuls of cream, and 
four eggs beaten together ; to which add half a 
pound of butter wafhtd in rofe-water, half a pound 
of loaf fugar in powder, and half a pound of cur- 
rants pick'd and rub'd very clean in a cloth. When 
thefe are well united together, make them into 
cakes, and put them into an oven hot enough to 
bake rolls : bake them till they are coloured on 
both fides, then take down the oven lid, and let 
them foak. 

70 make a POUND-CAKE. 

Take a pound of melted butter, and beat it in 
an earthen pan with your hand, or a large wooden 
fpoon, all one way, till it appears like thick cream :

caution is abfolutely neceflary, otherwife it will 
not keep. 

'The common way of potting TONGUES, BEEF, 
VENISON, and FOWLS. 

Take a tongue, beef, &c. after it has been 
boiled and is cold ; cut it fmall, and beat it in a mar- 
ble mortar, with two anchovies and melted butter, 
till it comes to a pafte ; then lay it down clofe in 
your pots, and cover it with clarified butter. You 
may feafon any fort of cold fowl, and put it into a 
pot whole; cover it with butter in the fame manner. 

A 'particular way to pot VENISON. 

Lay a piece of fat and lean venifon in a broad 
earthen pan, and flick bits of butter all over it ; 
then cover the top with brown paper, tie it on, and 
bake it : when it is enough, take the venifon out, 
lay it in a dim, and drain it , when it is cold, take off* 
the fkin, but not the fat, and then cut it fmall -, 
put it in a marble-mortar, with a little of the but-

Of the NATURE o/ ALIMENTS; 

or the good and bad effeEts of 

MEATS and DRINKS. 

Of ALIMENTS from QUADRUPEDES 

or Jour footed animals. 

Of the farts of QUADRUPEDES in general. 

H E MUSCULOUS FLESH of quadrupedes is more 
nourifhing than any other part, is moil in ufe, 
and makes up the bulk of the body. When animals 
are very young, and continue fucking, the flefh is 
tender, foft, vifcous, and abounds with moifture : 
However, it digefts eafily, and keeps the body 
open. Older animals have flefh that is more firm, 
of a richer juice, of a finer flavour, and yield more 
nourifhment , but thofe which are very old are dry, 
hard, and difficult of digeftion. Thofe which are 
bred or fed in low mar my places, breed grofs hu- 
mours ; while fuch as run upon high mountainous 
land, where the air is pure and ferene, are better 
tafted, more wholefome, and yield much better 
nourimment. Hogs, that live upon acorns, or 
are fed with peafe, afford much better meat than 
thofe that eat grains, and devour all manner of 
filth. Every one knows the difference between 
tame rabbets, and thofe that are brought from a 
warren, where they are nounmed with odoriferous 
herbs. 

The 



The Art of COOKERY. 193 

The flefh of the males of fome of thefe creatures 
is hot, rank, dry, and hard of digeflion, fuch as 
the bull and ram ; while others are more agreeable 
then that of the females, particularly buck-ve- 
nifon. The gelding of animals while they are 
young, renders the flefh tender, of a fweeter tafte, 
much more nourifhing, and more eafy of digeflion. 
Thus ox-beef, and weather mutton is preferable 
to the other kinds. Boiled flefh is more moid than 
that which is dreft in any other manner, and is 
moft proper for hot, dry and bilious conftitutions ; 
while that which is roafted, or fryed, agrees better 
with the cold and phlegmatic, who are fubject to 
catarrhs, and other moift di (orders. 

Befides the mufculous flefh, there are other parts 
which are frequently eaten, and therefore will come 
next under ccnfideration. 

The LIVER is a bowel defignedby nature for the 
feparation of the gall, from the mafs of blood : 
it is generally of a dole, compact fubftance, hard 
of digeflion, and apt to occafion obftructions : 
however, it differs greatly according to the age, the 
nature of the animals, and the kind of the aliment 
they live upon. Young animals that are well fed, 
have livers which are tender, fucculent, and of an 
agreeable tafte. Thus the livers of lambs, pigs, 
calves, pullets, and capons, are generally looked 
upon as good eating. 

The MELTS or SPLEENS of animals generate a 
thick, grofs and melancholy juice : therefore it is a 
bad cuflom, which fome are guilty of, to make 
gravy of this part. 

The KIDNEYS of old animals are of a hard, corn- 
pad fubftance, and are difficult to digeft; but 
thofe of calves, lambs, and fucking pigs, are ten- 
der, and have an agreeable tafte. 

The HEART is of a folid compact fubftance, and 
not very eafy of digeftion ; however, when well 

O dreffed, 



1 94 h Art 0/*CooKERY. 

drefled, it .yields good nourifhment, and a lau- 
dable juice. 

The LUNGS, or as fome call them the LIGHTS, 
are of a foft, moift, fucculent, and light fubftances 
eafy of digeftion, and fufficiently nourifhing ; but 
there are not many who are fond of feeding upon 
them alone. 

The GLANDS, particularly the fweet-bread, are 
tender, of an agreeable tafte, yield good juice 
and nourifhment, being of eafy digeftion. 

The STONES of young animals have a very fine 
tafte, and yield exceeding good nourimment ; 
lamb-ftones particularly are eafy enough to be 
had, and are in high efteem for making a delicate 
dim. 

The TONGUE is inferior to no other part in tafte 
and delicacy. The tongues of lambs, fheep, calves, 
and hogs, are eafy of digeftion : that of an ox, 
or a neats-tongue, is more grofs, but the flavour 
is very agreeable, and it yields very good nou- 
rimrrient. 

The FEET are compofed of ligaments, tendons, 
griftles, arteries, and veins ; when they are well 
boiled, they diflblve into a kind of gelly, and arc 
very proper for confumptive perfons, and thofe 
whofe blood and juices are acrimonious, or full of 
lharp humours. 

The INTESTINES are of a membranous fubftance, 
and confequently hard of digeftion ; but tripe that 
is fat, good, and well boiled, is very much in 
requeft, being readily digefted, and free from all 
bad qualities. 

The BLOOD is never ufed as aliment, except that 
of hogs, in making black puddings ; but though 
they are common food, efpecially in country pla- 
ces, they are hard of digeftion, and yield no good 
nourifhment. 

Of 



Art of C o K E RV. 195 

Of VEAL. 

Good veal is of a cooling, moiftening, and bal- 
famic nature, yields good nourifhment, and keeps 
the body open : the head and lights are proper ali* 
mcnt for perfons troubled with diforders of the 
lungs, and who are likely to fall into a confump- 
tion : the feet are pectoral likewife, and proper 
to blunt and fheath the acrimony of the humours. 
Veal broth is good in large bleedings, overflow- 
ing of the menfes, piles, and fpitting of blood> 
Veal agrees with all ages and conftitutions, but it 
is moft proper for the weak and delicate, who 
feldom ufe exercife. 

Of BEEF. 

Beef was cenfured by the antients as being hard 
of digeflion, and yielding grofs nourimment j but 
experience mows the contrary , for though it is very 
much eaten among us, we- find no fuch bad effect : 
on the contrary, it is very wholefome, and renders 
perfons vigorous and ftrong. However, this mult 
be unde. flood of cattle that are well fed, and 
killed at a proper age. In general, it is beft for 
thofe that have a good appetite, that ufe much 
exercife, and are of a bilious coftftitution. Ox-beef 
is bed, cow- beef next, and bull-beef word of all : 
heifer- beef is thought by fome to be inferior to 
none. 

Of PORK, and PIG. 

A barrow hog is a boar that was gelded under a 
year old, which renders the flefh of a much finer 
flavour than that either of the boar or fow. It 
mufl be killed while young or middle aged, for an 
old hog is dry, tough, and hard of digeftion. Ic 
fhould be fed with acorns, peafe or beans ; but 

O 2 the 



1 96 *fbe Art of COOKERY. 

the two firft are beft. It is fubjeft to the leprofy, 
quinfy, ano^ the evil. Pork infected with this laft 
diftemper is faid to be meafled : it is known by 
kernels in the fat, like hail-fhot. In all thefe cafes, 
the flefh is very unwholefome, and apt to breed 
difeafes : in general, pork fhould never be eaten 
when the weather is very hot , it yields plenty of 
nourifhment, but is hard of digeftion, and if ufed 
too often, breeds thick grofs humours : it it bad 
for perfons afflicted with the gout , as alfo for 
thofe that are old, weak, delicate, and inactive. It 
agrees beft with thofe that have a good appetite, 
ufe muchexercife, and are of a bilious conftitution. 
Sucking pigs abound with moifture, and are there- 
fore beft roafted. 

Of the WILD-BOAR. 

The wild-boar is not to be met with in England 
at prefent, whatever it might have been when the 
country was over-run with woods. In many parts 
of. America, the fwine, whick were carried over by 
the Spaniards, are become wild, and hide them- 
felves in the woods. As thefe animals ufe more 
exercife, and feed in a different manner from the 
tame, the flefli is lefs vifcous, more agreeable, 
an$ eafy of digeftion, to which their being hunted 
will contribute. It is very fit for healthy, robuft 
perfons, who ufe a great deal of exercife, and 
require a large quantity of nourifhment. 

Of LAMB. 

The flefh of a good lamb is tender, white, and 
delicate. The feafon for it to be ufed, is the fpring ; 
but now, by a particular management, it may be 
had before Chriftmafs, and almoft at all times of 
the year. It yields plenty of nourimment, does 
not heat the body, nor create lharp acrimonious 

humours. 



Art ^COOKERY. 197 

humours. It will agree with all conftitutions, but 
better with the hot and bilious, than the cold and 
moift. In general, it is a fafe, innocent diet. It 
ought to be well boiled or roafted. 

Of MUTTON. 

The beft fheep are bred in dry paftures and 
downs, "where the air is pure and dry. The 
youngeft is generally recommended ; but fome 
gentlemen of fortune will not touch it till it is 
above five years old ; the tafte and flavour being 
then rich and high : However, it ought to be well 
fed, fat, and free from the diftemper which fheep are 
fubjeft to, that is the rot. It is greatly nourifhing, 
balfamic, creates good juices, and agrees with all 
ages and conftitutions. Weather mutton is beft, 
the next is that of the ewe ; but ram-mutton is 
rank, and has a fmell much like a goat. 

Of the KID and GOAT. 

A kid fhould be killed before it is weaned, and 
tinder fix months old : for as this -creature advan- 
ces in age, the flefh becomes hard, tough, and has 
a difagreeable fmell ; the flefh is eafy of digeftion, 
very nourifhing, and breeds good juices : it may 
be eaten at all times of the year, and agrees with 
all ages and conftitutions, efpecially thofe that are 
recovering after a fit of ficknefs, or whofe ftrength 
is exhaufted : the flefh of a goat is rank and un- 
pleafant, but if gelded when young, he becomes 
fat, and yields good nourishment. The flefh of 
the fhamois-goat is more pleafant and wholefome. 

Of the ROE-BUCK and ROE. 

Thefe animals are to be met with in woody 
mountains fuch as the Alps, in Switzerland, and 

O 3 fome 



1 98 The Art of COOKERY. 

fome parts of Scotland. The roe-buck has bran- 
ched horns, which fall off yearly, and is of the fize 
of a goat, of which kind he feems to be. It is a 
fearful nimble animal, running with great fwift- 
nefs, and has a very acute fight, feeing as well by 
night as by day. If this creature is killed when 
fat, young, and well fed, the flefh yields excellent 
nourifhment fit for any age or conftitution , but if 
old, it is dry, tough, and hard of digeftion. 

Of VENISON. 

Venifon is a fiefti that is generally admired, e- 
fpecially while it is fat and in feafon, which is gene- 
rally till September for buck-venifon 5 at which 
time he begins to rut, and then the fiefh becomes 
rank and difagreeable. Doe-venifon is not fo ex- 
quifite and high flavoured, but is very good eating 
if not too old, and is very wholefome and nou- 
rifhing. "When thefe animals are old, the fiefh. 
becomes hard and compacT:, hard of digeftion, lies 
heavy on the ftomach, and generates grofs melan- 
cholic humours. Venifon agrees well with all 
ages and fexey, but is moft proper for young peo- 
ple of bilious conftitutions, and who ufe a great 
deal of exercife : but there needs little caution on 
this head, becaufe the price of vcnifon is fo high, 
there is no danger of living upon it conftantly. 
The horns are of great ufe for making gellies, 
which are ufeful to re-eflablifh the ftrength, to 
fortify the ftomach, to fheath the acrimony of the 
humours, to ftop a loofenefs, vomiting, and fpit- 



ting of blood. 



HARES. 



A hare mould l?e young, tender, well fed, fat, 
and caught by hunting : the flefli yields moderate 
nourishment, and generates good juices. However, 

when 



*fbe Art of COOKERY. 199 

when too old, it is hard of digeftion, breeds grofs 
melancholic humours, and renders perfons heavy 
and fleepy. Hafes that frequent low, moift, mar- 
fhy grounds are not fo good as thofe that live on 
dry land and mountainous countries, becaule thefe 
laft feed on aromatic herbs, which render the flefh 
of a finer tafte, and a more high flavour. They 
are likewife better in winter then in the fummer, for 
in cold weather the flefh is more tender, more eafy 
of digeftion, and has a more delicate rclifh. 

Q v RABBETS. 

Thofe rabbets are befl that are bred in warrens, 
and feed upon odoriferous herbs, which frequently 
grow wild in fuch places. Rabbets are beft when 
middle aged, for when they are too young, they 
breed vifcous humours, and when too old, the 
flefh is dry, hard, and not eafy of digeftion. They 
agree with all ages and conititutions, provided 
they are ufed with moderation. Tame-rabbets are 
more rank, and not fo well tailed as the wild, 
becaufe their feeding is different, and thefe laft 
ramble about at pleafure, which renders their flefh. 
more wholefome and fit for nourifhment. 

Of MILK. 

Milk differs greatly with refpeft to the animal 
from which it is taken ; the age of that animal, the 
nature of its feeding, and the time of the year 
wherein it is ufed. In medicine, the milk of a 
found woman is moft wholefome ; next to this the 
milk of an afs, which is found to be of great ufe in 
confumptions, and other diforders of the lungs. 
Goat's milk is not fo ferous, and therefore is more 
fuitable to perfons of moift conftitutions, being very 
proper to reftore the decays of nature. Ew's milk 
yields more cheefe and butter than either of the 

O 4 former, 



200 *he Art of COOKERY. 

former, and is never ufed but when other milk is 
wanting. Cow's milk is more generally ufed for 
aliment than any other, becaufe it abounds with 
oily particles, which renders it very proper for 
nourifliment, befides, it has a more agreeable taftc 
than the milk of other animals. Mare's milk is 
more ferous than any, and contains lefs of the 
cheefy and buttery parts. The hords of Tartars, 
who wander -from place to place, have it in the 
higheft efteem, and after it has undergone a fer- 
mentation, they frequently drink it till they are 
intoxicated. 

The milk of every animal is more or lefs whole- 
fome according to the different feafons of the year. 
In the fpring and fummer it is more ferous, lefs 
thick, and more eafy of digeftion than at any otHr 
time, becaufe the animal feeds on more juicy grafs. 
Likewife when the animal is in its ftrength and 
vigour, its milk is more concocted, better condi- 
tioned, and more eafy of digeftion. In general, 
all forts of milk, when they are good in their kind, 
are eafy of digeftion, nourifh much, increafe the 
feminals fluids, reftore the health of the meagre, 
attenuated and confumptive, take off heat of urine, 
and the pains of the gout ; fheathe acrimonious 
humours in the breaft and other parts ; for which 
reafon it is good in loofeneffes, the bloody flux, 
and when perfons have fwallowed corrofive poi- 
fons. In this laft cafe, it muft be mixt with oil, 
and drank plentifully. 

The greaieft inconvenience is its curdling in the 
flomach, for then it will caufe teniions of belly and 
gripes, efpecially in children. For the fame reafon, 
it it not good in fevers, pituitous catarrhs, nor for 
perfons troubled with obftructions. Therefore all 
thole that abound with acids in the ftomach and 
fir ft pa/Tages, mould be careful how they ufe it till 
they are corrected. 

When 



Art of COOKERY. 201 

When milk has flood for fome time, a cream 
will rife to the top, which being whipt whith rods' 
will become rarified, thin, and eafy of digeftion. 
This is called whipt cream. 

Of BUTTER and BUTTER-MILK. 

There are as many different butters, as there 
are milks of different animals \ but that moil in 
ufe is butter made with cows milk, which is beft 
in the month of May. Butter is nourishing and 
pectoral, keeps the body open, blunts the points 
of acrid poifons, and is properly mixt in clyflers 
for the bloody flux. The exceffive ufe of butter 
relaxes and weakens the flomach, deflroys the ap- 
petite, caufes the reaching to vomit, and heats the 
body, efpecially when it is old ; when it is frefli, 
it is very wholefome, and agrees with all ages and 
conftitutions. 

Butter-milk is of excellent ufe as a medicine, 
becaufe it not only nourifhes, but is cooling and 
moiflening. It fuppreffes all preternatural heats 
proceeding from diibrders of the bowels -, cures 
obflinate hoarfneffes, catarrhs, hectic fevers, and 
fuch bleeding in the flomach and guts as renders 
the flools black with a horrible flench. It likewife 
cures pifling of blood in the fmall pox, and has 
been reckoned a great fecret in ulcers of the kidneys. 

Of CHEESE and WHEY. 

Cheefe is nothing elfe but the curds of milk fe- 
parated from the ferum of whey, preffed and 
dried with a gentle heat. It may be made with all 
forts of milk, but that of cows is mofl common. 
It ought to be made with new milk, and mould be 
ufed when it is neither too old nor too new. Cheefe 
yields plenty of nourifhment, but is hard ofdige- 
ftion, and agrees beft with labouring people : eaten 

at 



202 The Art of COOK E * Y. 

at night it lies heavy on the flomach, and difturba 
reft. However a little of it after meals promotes 
the digeftion of others aliments. It is by no means 
proper food for thofe who are troubled with the 
gravel or ftone. When cheefe is new, it is foft, 
clammy and abounds with humidity ; whence it is 
hard of digeftion, lies heavy on the ftomach, and 
generates wind. When it is very old, it becomes 
dry, fharp, bites the tongue, and is quite of another 
nature from what it was at firft, whenct many bad 
effects enfue. All cheefe is not equally efteemed ; 
Parmefan, Chiltoun, and Chedder, are the beft ; 
good Gloceftermire and Chefhire are the next; 
Suffolk cheefe is worft of all. Some have fuch a 
natural antipathy to cheefe, that they cannot fit at 
the table where it is placed. 

Whey is proper to keep the body open, to cleanfe 
the ftomach and guts, to cool preternatural heats, 
and to purify the blood. Hence it is beneficial in 
bilious, burning/and malignant fevers, either alone 
or with a little of the juice of oranges or lemons. 
In all cafes where there is more need of tempera- 
ting the humours than nourifhment, whey is of the 
greateft fervice. Whey drank for a month or two 
is good in all chronic diftempers.

Of ALIMENTS from WINGED 
ANIMALS. 



Of FOWLS. 

OWLS are of feveral kinds, and are diffe- 
rent with refped to their fize, the beauty of 
their plumage, and other particularities. Thofe 
pullets that are young , well fed, and have not 

yet 



F 



*fbe Art of COOKER Y. 

yet begun to lay, are beft : likewife cocks are belt 
when they are about the fame age. The fiefh is 
eafy of digeftion, generates good juices, is very 
nourifhing, is cooling and moiftening, very who- 
Jefome, and is proper for perfons who have been 
brought low by difeafes. It agrees with all ages 
and conftitutions, but more efpecially with the de- 
licate, and thofe that lead an inactive life : for 
thofe that are ftrong, robuft, and ufe much exer- 
cife, generally require more folid aliment, which 
does not pafs off fo fpeedily. The flefh of old 
fowls is dry, hard, and not eafily digefted : howe- 
ver they may be very properly made ufe of for 
broths and foups, which are very nourifhing and 
reftorative. Cocks-combs are reckoned a great 
delicacy by fome. 

Of CHICKENS. 

Chickens are beft when they are about two or 
three months old, and ought always to be roafted 
or broiled, unlefs there is any particular reafon to 
the contrary. The flefh is in all refpecls like the 
former, but is more proper for fick perfons, becaufe 
in fome degree it is more agreeable to a weak 
flomach,and the juices are not fo rich : for the fame 
reafon it islefs proper for ftrong healthy perfons, 
efpecially for frequent ufe. There is a fort of 
broth made with them which is called chicken 
water which is very proper for perfons afflicted 
with a fever, who can bear nothing but (lender 
aliment, 

Of CAPONS. 

A capon, as every one knows, is a gelded cock, 
whofe fiefii is rendered more tender by this ope- 
ration. For as the cock is a very lafcivious ani- 
mal, the balfamic parts of the blood are carryed off" 
by 2. too frequent attendance on the hens - t which 

is 



204 7^ -Art of C o o K E R Y. 

is prevented by taking away the caufe. The fiefh 
indeed is like that of a pullet, but it is more nou- 
rifhing, more agreeable, and more fuitable to per- 
fcnis accuftomed to fatigue, becaufe the juices of it 
are more elaborated, better concocted, and abound 
more with unftuous and balfamic particles. 

Of T u R K i E s. 

Thefe animals were formerly ftrangers in Europe, 
and were firft imported from Numidia in Africa, 
which being a hot country, it is no wonder they 
are brought up with difficulty in this climate. 
The nature and effects of the flefh differ very little 
from fowls ; for when they are young, fat, and 
well fed, they are very reftorative, contribute great- 
ly to preferve health, and are very proper aliment 
after a fit of ficknefs. Whatever has been faid of 
fowls may be applied to turkies, only the flefh 
is fomewhat more firm, and yields more lading 
aliment. 

Of PIGEONS. 

Pigeons are of feveral forts, but they may be 
reduced to two, the tame and the wild : tame 
pigeons mould be chofen young, flefhy, fat, and 
well fed. They nourifh much, are ftrongthening, 
promote urine, but render the body a little coftive. 
They agree with all ages and conftitutions, and are 
feldom or never obferved to have any bad effects. 
Even thofe that are old agree very well with ftrong 
healthy perfons, efpecially if they ufe much exer- 
cife. The ring-dove perches on boughs of trees, 
and feldom or never lights on the ground. The 
flefh is very well tafted, but is fomewhat drier 
than that of the tame pigeon. The moft delicate 
of all is the turtle-dove, for the flefh has the fined 
tafte and flavour ; nor is it fo dry as the former. , 

Of 



The Art of C o o K E R Y. 205 

Of GEESE. 

Geefe are either tame or wild, and are accounted 
good eating, efpecially the wild, which are better 
tafted than the other. Thofe are beft that are fat 
and full grown, for when they are too young, the 
flelh is clammy and breeds grofs, thick humours ; 
when too old it is dry, hard, is full of bad juices, 
and caufes indigeftion. They are moft in feafon 
From September till Chriftmafs. In general, a 
goofe is more agreeable to the tafte than to health, 
becaufe it abounds with thick, grofs juices, which 
render it hard of digeftion , tor which reafon it 
fhould not be eaten too frequently : however, it 
agrees well enough with flrong, robuft perfons, 
who have a good appetite and ufe much exercife, 
becaufe it yields folid and lafting nourifhment. 

Of DUCKS. 

A duck is an amphibious animal, becaufe it lives 
as well in the water as the land. It is either 
wild or tame : the latter is a very foul feeder, for 
there is no naftinefs that it will not devour. The 
fiefh is hard of digeftion and abounds with thick, 
clammy, grofs humours. They are beft in cold 
weather, and are fuitable for ftrong healthy per- 
fons, but are notfo good for the weak and delicate. 
The wild duck feeds cleaner, is finer eating and 
yields better nourishment. Both forts mould be 
chofen young, fat, and well fed. The widgeon 
and teal are much of the fame nature as the wild 
duck, only the teal is efteemed by fome to be a 
much greater delicacy than the other two. 



Of 



206 fbe Art 0fCooKtfRY. 
Of BUSTARDS. 

A buftard is about the fize of a turky, and flies 
with great difficulty. It delights in large open 
places, fuch as Salisbury plain. It lives upon 
grain, herbs, and fruits. Some of them weigh 
thirteens pounds and upwards. The flefh is a 
great delicacy as well as a rarity, and is by fomc 
preferred to a pheafant. It is of eafy digeftion, 
nourifhes much, and agrees with all ages and con- 
ftitutions. They are good, at all times of the year^ 
but belt in winter. 

Of PARTRIDGES. 

Partridges are in high efteem for their fine taflft 
and good qualities. The flem is firm, nourishing, 
reftorative, balfamic, ftrengthening, proper for 
perfons who are weakened by difeafes, and who are 
troubled with a loofenefs. Partridges fhould not 
be drefled immediately after they are killed ; for if 
they are hung up in an airy place for a day or two, 
they will become more tender, and eat better. 
They are beft in the winter feafon, and agree with 
all ages and conftitutions, but more particularly the 
moift and phlegmatic. 

Of PHEASANTS. 

The pheafant is a bird as large as a fowl, arid 
does not tafte much unlike it. However it is recko- 
ned more delicate, and yields excellent nourifh- 
ment. Some affirm a black-legged fowl approa- 
ches neareft to the flavour of the pheafant than any 
other. The cock-pheafant is in much higher 
efteem than the hen for the richnefs of its juices: 
the flefh is eafy of digeftion, reftorative, and good 
for weak, hectic, and confumptive people. Some 
affirm that it is good in convulfions and the falling 

fkknefs. 



Art of COOKERY. 207 

Icknefs. The autumn is the beft time for killing 
this bird, for then it is flefhy and fat. 

Of Q^u AILS. 

The antients had a very bad opinion of quails, 
and rcpreiented them as dangerous aliment ; but 
experience has fhown the contrary, for they are 
very good eating, only a little hard of digeftion : 
the flefh is very nourifhing, breeds good juices, 
and difagrees with no conftitutions. It is a bird of 
the partridge kind, but lefs, being no more than 
feven inches and a half to the end of the tail. 

Of THRUSHES. 

A thrum is a bird a little bigger than a lark, and 
the flefh is well tafted and nourifhing, "becaufe it 
abounds with unctuous and balfamic parts. It 
ftrengthens the ftomach, yields good aliment, 
and is good for perfons who are recovering from 
a difeafe. Some think thrufhes are good for 
the falling ficknefs, becaufe they feed on the ber- 
ries of the mifletoe which is accounted a fpecific in 
that difeafe. They are beft and mofl in leafon in 
cold weather. 

Of BLACK-BIRDS or OUZELS. 

Black birds have many things in common with 
thrufhes ; they delight in thick woods, and are more 
famous for finging than for food , not but they are 
nourifhing, ealy of digeftion, and breed good jui- 
ces. Some think them ufeful eating in dyfenteries, 
and the bloody flux. It needs not be mentioned that 
thofe which are young and fat are moil fit for ufe. 
But in taking thefe fort of birds, there is feldom any 
choice to be made -, however, the winter in the beft 
feafon for killing; them. 

Of 



208 ffie Art of C o o K E R Y. 

Of L A R K Si 

Larks are very delicate birds, and inhighefteem 
for their fine tafte, and the good effects they pro- 
duce. They abound with balfamic and volatile 
particles, which renders them reftorative, eafy of 
digeftion, and proper to generate good juices. As 
they grow old, they gradually loofe thefe volatile 
and balfamic parts, becoming dry and hard of dige- 
ftion. They are moft in feafon in the autumn j for 
they are then fat, and beft flavoured. There are great 
plenty of thefe birds taken on Dunftable-downs. 

Of O R T O L A N S. 

Ortolans are little birds of the fize of a chaffinch, 
and are to be met with in large quantities in fome 
parts of France. They take them firft in the be- 
gining of April, and continue all the month. The 
iecond time is the middle of A uguil, which lafts about 
four weeks. They are feldom fat enough without 
feeding, which they do in cages covered over with 
a cloth, otherwife they would be in conftant agita- 
tion. The flefh of an ortolan is tender, delicate, 
juicy, of an exquifite tafte, and feems to be little 
elfe but a lump of fat : they abound with balfa- 
mic, unduous, and volatiles particles which ren- 
ders them very wholefome : they are agreeable to 
all conftitutions, and there is no exception againft 
them, but their high price. There are feveral 
other fmall birds, fuch as fparrows, linnets, gold- 
finches, &c. which need not be mentioned in par- 
ticular. 

Of WOOD COCKS and SNIPES. 

Wood-cocks and fnipes are much of the fame 
nature, and differ chiefly in their fize : they are 



Art of COOKERY. 209 

temperate, light of digeflion, very nourifliing, and 
are beft in the winter time. The agreeable relifh. 
of thefe birds is a fufficient warrant for their quali- 
ties. Some fay they are hard of digeftion and heat 
the body, but I may venture to affirm they never 
found it by experience. There are feveral other 
forts of birds that might have been mentioned, fuch 
as water-hens, lapwings, plovers, rails, &c. but 
as they are feldom to be met with, or are feldom 
eaten, I lhali pafs them over in filence. 

Of EGGS. 

Eggs are of different forts -, thofe of hens and 
turkies are the beft, thofe of geefe and ducks are 
not fo good. Hens eggs are moft in ufe, which 
ftiould be new laid, and then they yield good nou- 
rifliment, increafe the feminal fluid, abate the 
fharpnefs of humours in the bread, are good in 
confumptions, enormous bleedings, and render 
the voice clear. W hen eggs are old, they heat the 
body, and are bad for bilious conftitutions. They 
fhould be moderately boiled and neither too much 
nor too little done, by which means they will be 
moft eafy of digeftion, and be more readily diftri- 
buted throughout the body. In general they may 
be eaten at any time, and are fuitable to all ages 
and conftitutions.

Of ALIMENTS from FISH. 

Of the PIKE. 

H E pike is a frelh water fifh, and is feldom or 
never met with in the fea. Thefe fifh taken in 
clear running water are better and more wholefome 
than thofe that are bred in muddy ponds or lakes. 
Thofe fhould be chofen that are frefh, fat, large, 
and well fed ; and the flefh will be firm, white, 
and flaky. It is moderately nourifliing, and the 
nourishment is pretty good. % It is beft in winter. 
It is a voracious cruel hardy fifh, will feed on its 
own kind, and will live a long while. The hard 
rows will often vomit and purge violently. 

Of tie CARP, BREAM, DACE, and ROACH. 

The carp is a frefh water fifh, and is to be met 
with in rivers, ponds, and lakes ; but the river 
carp is beft. They have no tongues, and are na- 
turally foft, clammy, and full of phlegmatic moi- 
fture when they are young. Thofe that are large 
and of a yellow colour are beft : likewife the male 
carp has firmer flefh than the female. They fpawn 
five or fix time a year. They are moft in feafon in 
March and September. They are very wholefome 
eating, for thofe that are fondeft of them never 
find any bad effects from their ufe ; though fome 
fay they are bad in the colic. 

The bream is a fifh not very unlike a carp, 
only it has a fmall head, is more flat, lefs, and not 
fo highly efteemed : it is bred in the fame waters, 
feeds in the fame manner, and produces the fame 
eiTccls. It is in feafon in March and April. It 
fpi'.wns in May. 

The 



The Art of C o o K E R Y. 2 1 1 

The dace is ftill lefs than the bream, and eats, 
more firm than the carp. The roach is not very 
different from the dace, unlefs in fhape : when they 
are fpotted, they are bad. At the beft it is not 
efteemed ; but if dreft immediately after they 
^re caught, they make no defpicable diih. 

Of the P E R c H. 

There are two forts of perches, the fea perch, and 
the frefh water perch ; the former is lefs than the 
latter. It is found near rocks, and lives upon 
little fifties. The flefh is dry, tough, and hard of 
digeftion, for which reafon it is feldom eaten. 
The frefh water perch, when in good order, is de- 
licate food, for it is eafy of digeftion, eats firm, is 
very nourifhing, and breeds good juices. This like 
all other fifh, when bred in muddy ponds is not fo 
good. It fpawns in March and April, and then it 
is out of feafon for fome time. 

Of the BARBEL. 

The barbel is a river fifh, and generally weighs 
two or three pounds. However, there are fome of 
feven or eight. He cannot well bear cold weather, 
and therefore he is molt in feafon in the fummer 
time. The ftefh is white, foft, and full of moifture, 
which becomes more firm when old , for which 
reafon he has a better flavour at that time, and 
yields good nourifhment. The fpawn mould be 
carefully taken out before dreffing,for it is a violent 
purge and vomit. 

Of EELS. 

Eels are of feveral kinds, but they all eat very 
well. The filver eel is accounted the beft -, the 

P 2 flefh 



212 The Art of COOKERY. 

flefh is tender, foft, and nourifhing, being full of 
unctuous and ballamic parts : but as they abound 
at the fame time with thick grofs clammy juices, 
they are not very eafy of digeftion ; for which 
reaibn they are beft when a little falted. They may 
be eaten either boiled, broiled, or roafted ; but 
the two latter ways are befl, becaufe by drefling 
them in thofe manners they are deprived of a great 
deal of their vifcous phlegm. They will likewife 
bear feafoning, and a glafs of wine to help dige- 
ftion. They may be eaten at all times of the year, 
but are thought to be not very good for thofe that 
are troubled with the gout or gravel. 

Of tbe T E N c H. 

The tench is a fiih at prefent in great efteem for 
its tafte : it delights chiefly in Handing waters, and 
in flow muddy rivers ; but is no lover of clear ra- 
pid ftreams. For which reafon the ufe of it is 
condemned by fome. But as lakes and ponds are 
the natural habitation of thefe fifh, and as expe- 
rience informs us that they are at leaft as good as 
carp, we need not abftain from them on that 
account. It yields good nourifhment to healthy 
perfons of found conftitutions, but is not fo proper 
for the weak and unhealthy. 

Of T R o u T s. 

There are feveral forts of trouts, which are diffe- 
rent with refpect to the water which they inhabit, 
their fize, and their colour. Some are found in 
rapid brooks and rivulets, and others in lakes. 
Some are blackifh, others reddifh, or rather of a 
gold colour. The largeft kind is the falmon trout, 
which fome think to be nothing but a young fal- 
mon. A trout is covered with fmall fcales com- 
monly 



*The Art of COOKERY. 213 

monly fpotted with red. Thofe are beft that are 
fat, well fed, and whofe fiefh is reddifh ; they are 
eafy of digeftion, afford good nourimmcnt, and 
increafe the ieminal fluid. They are moft in feafon 
in thefummer, and mould not be kep: long before 
they are dreft. In winter their fine flavour is loft. 

Of GUDGEONS. 

Common gudgeons are very well known, and 
are to be met with everywhere. Sea gudgeons 
have a long roundifh body about fix inches long, 
and of various colours ; the tail and fins are ol a 
pale blew ; the head is large and has a double row 
of fmall teeth. Gudgeons are a very innocent 
harmlefs fifh, and may be allowed to weak perfons. 
It is in ufe at all times, and may be eaten by per- 
fons of all conftitutions. 

Of S M E L T s. 

Smelts are fmall fifh which are bred in the fea, 
and come up into rivers, particularly the Thames, 
in the fpring feafon, where they are caught. They 
are not unlike gudgeons, but have a violet fmell, a 
bright pear colour, are a much greater delicacy, 
and have a much finer flavour. They make a very 
innocent dim, and are very far from producing 
any bad effects, for they may be eaten by weak 
fickly perfons as well as thofe that are in health, 

Of L, A M P R E Y S. 

Lampreys are of two kinds, the fea and the river 
lamprey ; ahefe laft are very fmall in comparifon 
of the other. The fea lampreys advance up the ri- 
vers in the fpring every year to fpawn, at which 
time they are in feafon, and are btft tafted , after 
which they become hard and tough, lofing their 

P 3 fine 



214 - ^ Je ^ rt f C OOKE R y. 

fine relifh. They have a griflle down the back , 
bur no bones, and are beft known by feven holes 
under their eyes all in a row, which fome call eyes. 
The flefli is foft and clammy, and yet more eafily 
digefted than that of an eel, of which kind it is. 
When properly dreft, they yield good nourifli- 
ment, and produce no bad effects, but they are 
fitteft for perfons in health and of hot conftitutions. 

Of S A L M o N s. 

The falmon is a fea-fifh, but comes up the rivers 
to fpawn, growing to a great bulk, for fome have 
weighed thirty fix pounds. It is fpotted with red 
or yellow fpots, has fmall fcales, a little head, a 
(harp fnout, and a forked tail. It is often caught 
in the Thames and Severn, but is brought to Lon- 
don,in the greateft quantities, from the rivers of the 
North, either frefli or pickled. The flefh of a 
falmon is flakey, fweet, lufcious, and extremely 
well tafted : but there is no fifh whatever is harder 
of digeftion, and more apt to load the ftomach. 
However, this inconvenience may be remedied by 
eating fparingly, and by proper drefllng. It is 
nourilhing, ftrengthening, and reftorative, agree- 
ing beft with the ftrong and robuft, but is not 
proper for the weak and fickly. 

Of WHITINGS. 

Whitings are a thin (lender fea-fifh, and feldom 
exceed a foot in length : the fcales are fmall, the 
back whiter than other fifh of this kind, and the 
belly is entirely white. There is no common filh 
in higher efteem than this , for it is of eafy dige- 
ftion, has an agreeable flavour, and may be eaten 
fafely by all forts of conftitutions ; even thofe that 
are weak and fickly may feed upon it, without any 
bad confequence. They come into feafon in No- 
vember. 7 Of

The haddock is bigger than a whiting, and 
lefs than a cod, and beneath the gills there is a black 
fpot on each fide, refembling the mark of a finger 
and a thumb ; the flefh eats firmer ^and dryer than 
that of a whiting, for which reaibn it is not fo 
much efleemed .However, it is a wholefome nou- 
rifhing fifh, and with good fauce will make an 
agreeable dim. They are in feafon in the begin- 
ning of November, and continue for fome time. 

Of C o D. 

The fifh called a cod is of the fhape and colour 
of a whiting, but is fomewhat darker on the back, 
and diverfified with yellowifh fpots : it has fcales 
that flick clofe to the fldn, large eyes, and a thick 
and fkfhy head. Salted cod is brought in great 
plenty from Newfoundland. When the flefh is 
frefh and new, it is very agreeable, very nourifh- 
ing, breeds good juices, and is eafy of digeflion j 
but when faked, it is hard of digeftion, eating dry 
and tough. When it is not fufficiently foaked, to 
take out a part of the fait is very heating ; and 
when it is foaked too much, it becomes infipid and 
deprived of its juicy parts, leaving nothing but 
hard indigeflible filaments. The longer it lies in 
fait, the worfe it becomes. It begins to be in 
feafon in October, and continues for fome months. 

Of LING. 

Ling is in fhape and colour pretty much like a 
pike, having fmall fcales, and a long round flender 
body , it is of the cod-kind, and by fome efteemed 
a delicacy when frefh , but when faked properly, 
and dryed, is reckoned by fome the beft of all fait 
fifh. P 4 Of

back of a lovely green with black ftreaks, and the 
belly of a filver colour. They are caught in great 
plenty in May and June, continuing in feafon till 
they are ftiotten or have loft their fpawn. It is a 
fifh in general efteem, and though eaten freely, 
ieldom or never produces any bad effects. Some 
think they are more wholefome when broiled than 
fried. 

Of HERRINGS, PILCHARDS, and SPRATS. 
Herrings are a fea-fifh, and univerfally known 
throughout Europe. They are either frelh, faked, 
pickled, or red. Frem herrings have a fat, foft, de- 
licate and well tafted flelh, which is eafy of dige- 
ftion, and yields good nourifhment. There is no 
comparifon between thofe that are quite new, and 
thofe that have been kept fome time. Salt her- 
rings are rendered hard of digeftion, exciting heat 
and third. The fame may be faid of red herrings, 
efpecially when they are cured fo as to be hard and 
dry , but when they continue moift, and are not 
over fait, they are much more wholefome. When, 
they are pickled after the Dutch manner, for which 
purpofe we have fifheries lately eftablifhed, they 
eat much more agreeably than either of the former 
wr.ys, and fell at a higher price ; but are not 
without inconveniences when eaten too freely : they 
are commonly caught, on our coafts, in September, 
and continue in feafon till they are fhotten. 1 he 
pilchard is rather fhorter than a herring, and the 
flefh eats fomewhat drier, otherwife it is much of 
the fame nature. Sprats are of the fame fhape, and 

have 



*Tbe Art of COOKERY. 217 

have the fame properties as herrings, but are much 
lefs. The beginning of catching them is generally 
in December, and they continue in feafon for fome 
time. They were formerly defpifed on account of 
their low price-, but this prejudice is got over, and 
they have made way to the tables of fome of the 
nobility. When they are quite new, they are very 
good eating. Some take them, but injudicioufly, 
for young herrings. 

Of the STURGEON. 

The fturgeon is a large fifh with a fharp mouth 
like a tube, and without jaws or teeth : it lives in 
the fea and rivers, but grows fatteft in the latter. 
It weighs from one hundred to two hundred 
pounds, it has five rows of fcales, two on each fide, 
and one on the back, which rife in knobs with 
prickles. Sturgeons are now and then taken in the 
Thames and other rivers in England. When the 
flefh can be had quite new and unfalted, it makes a 
very fine dim, is very nourifhing, and produces 
folid aliment : When it is falted, it becomes hard 
of digeftion, and unfit for weak infirm perfons j 
though many are very fond of it even then. 

Of the PLAISE, FLOUNDER, and DAB. 

The plaife is a flat fifh which fometimes grows 
to be a foot long, and feven inches broad. The 
back and fins are fpotted with round red fpots. 
The flounder is generally lefs, and much of the fame 
lhape, unlefs the body be a little longer in propor- 
tion when fully grown and fomewhat thicker. 
Some flounders have yellowiih fpots both on the 
back and fins. They are caught in rivers, though 
they are in great plenty in the fea : their flefh nou- 
rilhes much, and abates the fharp humours of the 

breaft, 



~ 1 8 tfbe Art of COOKERY. 

breaft, becaufe they contain an unctuous and balfa- 
mic juice. When eaten freely, they relax the in- 
teftines and open the body. The dab is thicker 
than the plaife, and has fcales, but no red fpots : 
the flefh is nourishing, but is not in fo great efteem 
as that of the former. 

Of the TURBOT and HALLIBUT. 

The turbot is a fea- fifh, and may be met with 
at all times of the year. It has no fcales : it is 
fometimes two foot and a half long, and about 
two broad : the upper part of the body is of an am- 
colour, and fprinkled, or as it were marbled, with 
black fpots. It is in high efteem for its goodnefs 
and agreeable tafte ; infomuch that fome call it the 
pheafant of the water : it is eafy of digeftion, 
breeds good juices, and nourimes very much. The 
hallibut feems to bear fome relation to the former, 
it grows to a much larger fize, and is for that 
reafon feldom fold by the fimmongers before it is 
cut in pieces. It likewife differs from the turbot 
in having fcales : the flefh is good eating, but not 
to be compared with that of the turbot. However, 
a good cook will be able to drefs it fo as to make an 
excellent difh. 

Of the S o A L. 

The foal is a fmooth fifli, of a longer and a nar- 
rower body than the flounder, and grows to a foot 
in length or upwards. The flelh is more firm and 
folid than that of the flounder. It yields plenty of 
nourifhment, has a pleafant tafte, and is full of good 
juices. Some call it the fea partridge. There is 
one thing remarkable of thefe fifh, that they are fold 
by pairs ; for when they are properly forted, if you 
lay the belly of one to the belly of another, they 
will tally exactly ; which is true of no other flat 
fifh that we know of. Of 



^fbe Art of COOKERY. 219 

Of the SKATE and THORNBACK. 

The fkate is a fmooth fifh, and the thornback 
rough with little round bits of bone which termi- 
nate in fmall points ; befides this, the difference is 
not confiderable. They are very well known, and 
the flefh is in great efteem as a reftorative. When 
thefe fifh are quite frefh, their flefh is hard, tough, 
and difficult of digeflion , but by keeping them 
fome days, it is brought to a proper temperature, 
and becomes excellent aliment : for this reafon, 
in land countries they may have thefe fifh in as 
good order as thofe that live by the fea-fide. 

Of the GAR-FISH. 

The gar-fifh has a long and flender body, with 
a very long fharp fnout : the back is green, the 
fides and belly of a filver colour, and the head of 
a bluifli green : the under jaw is longer than the 
upper, and both are armed with very fharp teeth, 
the upper jaw only is movable. The flefh is hard, 
dry, and but indifferent eating. 

Of the MULLET. 

The mullet is an inhabitant of the fea, rivers, 
and lakes. Some are bred in rivers, and others 
"come out of the fea into the mouths of rivers, where 
they flay fome time, and become fo fat as to render 
it lefs efteemed than thofe taken in the fea, becaufe 
the fat is of a bad tafle ; and therefore they eat beft 
broiled. The flefh of the fea-mullet is more firm, 
better tafted, more wholefome, and requires but 
little feafoning in regard of thofe before mentioned. 
Thofe that are taken in muddy waters are worft of 
all, and generate bad humours : they agree beft 
with ftrong healthy people, and are mcft in feafon 
in the autumn and winter. Of 



220 The Art of COOKERY. 

Of the S H A D. 

The mad is a fea-fifh that comes up to the river^ 
in the fpring, and is in feafon foon after ; for when 
it firft leaves the fea, it is meagre, , dry, and ill- 
tafted, but when it has been in the frefli water fome 
time, it become flefhy, fat, and of a better tafte. 
It is of the herring kind, and is at beft but a boney 
indifferent fifti. Some, to mend them, notch them 
deeply on the fides, and then lay them to broil over 
a hot fire ; by this means, they affirm, the bones 
are confumed, or at lead ceafe to be troublefome, 
and eat abundantly better. The Severn fhad are 
quite another fort of a fim. 

Of LOBSTERS, CRABS, and CRAWFISH. 

Thefe though different as to fhape and the 
places where they inhabit, are much of the fame 
nature, and yield the fame kind of nourifhment. 
They are very reftorative, and a proper diet for 
emaciated confumptive perfons. Crawfim foup 
has been long famous for diforders of the breaft, 
and for fupporting the ftrength of the weak and 
feeble. It is certain that the juice of all thefe ani- 
mals is unctuous and balfamic, and the flefh pro- 
per to help ulcers in the throat and lungs, to pro- 
mote urine, and to purify the blood. Lobfters and 
crabs mould be frem caught, and flefhy. It is 
faid they are not in feafon in thofe months with an 
R in them. 

' Of O I S T E R S. 

Oifters are of as many different kinds as the 
places from which they are brought : Thofe in 
higheft efteem are the Milton ; then Colchefter, 
Queenborough, &c. They fhould be chofen of 

middle 



The Art of COOKERY. 221 

a middle fize, fat, plump, and full of liquor. Oifters 
fharpen the appetite, promote urine, open the 
body, and are great provocatives. Eaten mode- 
rately they are very wholefome, and good in all 
confumptive cafes, becaufe they nourim very much. 
They are beft raw -, for when roafled, fcolloped, 
or boiled, they are more hard of digeftion. They are 
in feafon in cold weather, or, according to the 
common faying, when there is an R in the month, 
But the truth is, in the fummer time, when they 
caft their fpat or fpawn, they are lean and fickly ; 
and if no regard was had to this, they would never 
be eatable between the tropicks, which is contrary 
to all experience. . 

Of MVSCLES and COCKLES. 

Mufcles that are fat, white, and new, are very 

nourifhing, and very eafy of digeftion. They are 

never eaten raw, but are put in a fauce-pan over 

the fire to ftew in their own liquor till they are all 

open, and then they are done enough. It is well 

known that fome, after eating mufcles, have been 

fo puffed up and fwelled as if they had taken poi- 

fon : the fpeedieft remedy in this cafe, is a vomit 

with oily fat things. Some attribute this effect to 

a fmall crab which is fometimes found in thefe 

fhells ; but thofe that are taken near Copperas or 

Brafs works will always produce this pernicious 

accident : otherwife they appear to me to be very 

wholefome, never overloading the ftomach, nor 

caufing the leaft inconvenience. They are beft in 

cold weather, and when taken in or near the fea. 

Cockles are of the fame nature, and are equally 

nourishing, but they give fome trouble to clear 

them from the fand. They are never eaten raw.

Of TORTOISES or SEA-TURTLES. 

Tortoifes are reckoned a delicacy abroad, and 
are often imported into this nation, with intent to 
feaft particular peribns. There are feveral forts, 
but the green and loggerhead are moft in vogue. 
They lay a prodigious number of eggs of the fize 
of a hen's, which are eaten very greedily by failors. 
The fiefli of a tortoife has a very agreeable tafte, 
and refembles beef, though others fay veal : the 
fat looks green, is very fweet, and fits eafy on the 
flomach, though it will fometimes happen that 
thofe who are not ufed to this kind of meat will 
find it a little purgative at firft. It is very nourilh- 
ing, reftorative, and very proper for confump- 
tive perfons. They are of different fizes according 
to their age, and fome have weighed four hundred 
pounds. In Jamaica it is to be found in the mar- 
kets like beef or mutton, and is reckoned ufeful 
againfl the fcurvy, gout, leprofy, French pox, and 
many diforders of the (kin. 



Of ALIMENT taken from 
VEGETABLES. 

Of STRAWBERRIES. 

'T 1 HERE are two forts of ftrawberries, thofe 
that grow in gardens, and thofe that will not. 
The garden ftrawberries are beft, and moft in 
efteem, of which fome are red, and fome are 
white. They mould be chofen large, ripe, full 
of juice, with a fragrant fmell, and a vinous tafte. 
They are cooling, quench thirft, promote urine, 

and 



The Art of COOKER Y. 223 

and take off the heat of the ftomach. They may 
be eaten after dinner with cream, and fugar, or 
with wine, without any prejudice, avoiding excefs. 
They are very ufeful in hot weather, efpecially to 
thofe of warm conftitutions. 

Of RASBERRIES. 

Rafberries have much the fame nature as ftraw- 
berries, and mould be chofen large, juicy, and 
agreeable to the tafte and fmell. They are cooling, 
cordial, and ftrengthen the ftomach when eaten 
moderately. The juice mixt with fugar, is very 
good to abate the heat in fevers. Rafberries infufed 
in wine, impart a delicious tafte and fmell. In ge- 
neral, they are very good for hot bilious perfons, 
whofe blood and humours are in commotion. 

Of GOOSEBERRIES. 

Unripe goofeberries have an acid, auftere tafte; 
for which reafon they are cooling and binding ; 
as alfo very ufefui in fauce, to quicken the appetite; 
but eaten raw, they are hurtful, void of all nou- 
rimment, breed wind, and are bad for cold fto- 
machs. When ripe, they are foft, fweet, of an 
agreeable tafte, and lofe their binding quality. 
They are apt to corrupt in the ftomach, and there- 
fore mould not be eaten too freely. 

Of CURRANTS. 

Currants are red, white, and black. The two 
former are of the fame nature, and are proper to 
abate internal heat, to reftrain the commotions of 
the blood and humours, to ftrengthen the fto- 
mach, to excite the appetite, are very ufeful in bi- 
lious loofeneffes and fevers ; as alfo in hzemorrha- 
ge?,from a diflblution or effervefcence- of the blood. 

Some 



224 The Art of COOKERY. 

Some think them rather too fharp for the ftomach ; 
but a little fugar will remedy that inconvenience. 
Black currants have many phyfical virtues, for they 
promote urine, and are ufeful in the gravel and 
ftone. Some commend them in the wandring 
gout, convulfions, and the palfey. The gelly made 
with the juice has done wonders in curing the quin- 
fey or inflammation of the throat. A little of it 
fhould be (wallowed frequently. 

Of CHERRIES. 

Cherries are of feveral forts, fuch as the common 
red cherry, the black cherry, the great and fmall, 
white-heart, the black-heart, the bleeding heart, 
and the morello. Black cherries are a very whole- 
fome fruit, and the lead apt to furfeit of any. 
They have been recommended by many phyficians 
againft difeafes of the head and nerves, which fhows 
they are very far from prejudicing health. Black- 
cherries have been brought into difrepute from the 
poifonous effects of their diftilled water, which have 
been lately difcovered. But as this may be owing 
to the manner in which it was made, it certainly 
deferves farther conlideration. The common cher- 
ries are cooling, quench thirft, temperate the bile, 
and keep the body open. Their juice mixt with 
water, and fweetened with fugar, make a very 
agreeable drink in hot weather, is grateful to the 
ftomach, and ufeful in fevers. They are bad for 
thofe that haye a weak ftomach,which abounds with 
acid humours, or who are troubled with loofenefies. 

Of APRICOTS. 

Thofe apricots are beft that are large, flefliy 
coloured, ripe, and which part eafily from the 
ftone. They are agreeable to the ftomach, excite 

the 



The Art of COOKERY. 225 

the appetite, promote urine, and are very proper 
for young perfons of hot conftitutions : but they 
are bad for the cold and moifl, and thofe that have 
weak flomachs, for they corrupt therein. When 
eaten immoderately,they fill the ilomach with wind, 
yield a watry nourifhment, and by that means ren- 
der the blood poor, breeding nervous fevers. 

Of PEACHES and NECTARINES. 

Nectarines differ in nothing from common pea- 
ches, but in the fmoothnefs of the rind, being en- 
tirely of the fame nature. Some divide peaches 
into thofe that part readily from the ftone, and 
thofe that do not. Thefe laft are more foft, mu- 
cous, and watry than the former, and confequentiy 
are not fo good. The belt have a fine fmell, 
an agreeable lively tafte, and look beautiful to 
the eye. They cool, moiften the body, and like 
other fummer fruits, yield very little nourifhment. 
When eaten immoderately, they breed crude juices, 
colicks, loofenefles, the bloody flux, and nervous 
fevers. They are hurtful to cold conftitutions, 
and to thofe who have weak, cold flomachs. 

Of PLUMBS. 

The kinds of plumbs are almofl innumerable, 
and differ as to fize, colour, fmell, and tafte. 
They are generally bed that part readily from the 
ftone, but the palate is the principal judge of their 
goodnefs. In general, they are cooling, excite 
the appetite, and quench thirft. They are very 
good for young perfons, and thofe that are of a hot 
and dry conftitution. But they are bad for thofe 
that have weak flomachs, for they weaken the tone 
of that part, produce loofenefles, which often turn 
to a bloody flux. Therefore old perfons, and 
thofe that abound with phlegm, ought to abftain 

Q. from 



226 *fhe Art of COOKERY. 

from them entirely. If we obferve thofe years ki 
which this fruit is very plentiful, we fhall ftnd 
bloody fluxes, nervous and putrid fevers to be very 
common among low people. 

Of A P P L E s. 

Apples are of fo many kinds, ir would take a 
volume to treat of them diftinctly ; I fhall there- 
fore range them according to their tafte and fmell. 
Thofe that are fragrant and fweet, with a little 
tartnefs, are efteemed very wholefome, becaufc 
they agree with cold weak ftomachs, and are re- 
freming and nouriming. Sour apples are cooling, 
and are fuitable to a ftomach that is full of grofs vif- 
ctd humours, becaufe they are inciding and clean- 
fmg: However, they breed wind> and when eaten 
too often raw, they are hurtful to the nerves. Thofe 
that are watery, and have an infipid tafte, corrupt 
readily in the ftomach, and are little worth. Thofe 
that have a rough tafte, and are of a firmer con- 
fiftince, pafs flowly through the body, are ftreng- 
thening, and occafion coftivenefs. All unripe ap- 
ples are bad, hard of digeftion, and prejudicial to 
health : from the eating of thefe, children and 
woman are afflicted with various difeafes, efpecially 
worms, colics, and weaknefs of the nerves. Ap- 
ples mould be eaten with great moderation, and are 
belt coddled or roafted. 

Of PEARS. 

There is a greater variety of pears than apples, 
of which thofe are beft which have a fweet rich 
vinous tafte. The rough and ftyptick are hard of 
digeftion. Some have this quality to fuch a degree 
that they cannot be fwallowed but with the utmoft 
difficulty, and therefore they are called Choak- 
pears. The unripe are hard of digeftion, and 

u n who- 



The Art of COOTIE RY. 227 

URwholefome. Even pears in general are reckoned 
enemies to the nerves, when eaten immoderately. 
This appears from the difeafes that afflict women 
and children, who fwallow all forts without diftin- 
clion in a plentiful year. They yield more nou- 
rimment than apples, but it is of a bad fort, and 
is apt to caufe nervous fevers, by impoveri thing 
the blood. Some pears that are hard and unfit to 
eat raw, become very ufeful when itewed with a 
little fpice. 

O/ F i G s> 

There are feveral forts of figs, which differ in 
lhape, fize, colour, and tafte. They ought to be 
chofen foft, juicy, ripe, and of a fsveet delicious 
tafte. In hot fouthern countries they are greatly 
ufed as aliment as well as dates. They are eafy of 
digeftion, yield moderate nourimment, have a de- 
tergent faculty, and are ufeful in diforders of the 
breaft, kidneys, and bladder. If eaten too fre- 
quently, they are windy, deprave the blood, de- 
ject the ftrength, and breed obftructions. Dry 
figs imported from abroad are moft ufed in phyfick, 
for they are good in diforders of the breaft and 
lungs, coughs, and the aflhma. \Vhen eaten be- 
fore dinner, they open the body, and cleanfe the 
breaft from thick humours and the kidneys from 
gravel. 

Of Qjtf i N C E s. 

Thofe quinces are beft that are ripe, flefhy, and 
have an agreeable fmell. They fhould never be 
eaten raw, becaufe then they generate wind, and 
caufe crudities. They are beft made into marma- 
lade, for this ftrengthens the ftomach, flops vomit- 
ing, is good in loofenefies, and profufe bleeding 
of all kinds : it is fuitable to all ages and confti- 
tutions, provided it be taken moderately. 

Q^2 Of 



228 The Art of COOKERY. 

Of POME GRANATES. 

There are three forts of pome granates, the ibur 9 
the vinous, and the fweet. The four flrengthen 
the ftomach, flop vomiting and loofenefles, fhar- 
pen the appetite, and abate the heat of fevers : but 
they are bad in diforders of the bread, and are 
hurtful to the teeth and gums. The fweet are 
cooling, moiftening, abate the Iharpnefs of acri- 
monious humours in the breaft, and are ufeful in 
coughs. Thefe and the vinous agree with all ages 
and conftitutions, provided they are ufed with mo- 
deration. The four are befl in hot weather, and 
are moft fuitable to perfons of a bilious conftitu- 
tion ; but are hurtful to old perfons, becaufe they 
render the breathing difficult. 

Of MELONS. 

The fkm of melons is moiftening, allays the 
heat of the blood, chears the fpirits, is eafy of di- 
geftion, and yields good nourifnment when eaten 
with moderation ; but when it is fed upon with 
cxcefs, it generates crudities and caufes violent co- 
lics, which are often followed with a very violent 
loofenefs, or the bloody flux, which are hard to 
cure. Sometimes the immoderate ufe of melons is 
fucceeded with quartan agues, which are very obfti- 
nate. Befides, old perfons, who are of a plegmatic 
or melancholic constitution, ought to abftairi from 
them. However, the bad efftfts may be prevented 
by eating them with fait and pepper. Some fttow 
fugar over them, and drink freely of generous 
wine afterwards. 



The Art of COOKERY. 229 

Of CUCUMBERS. 

The world has been greatly divided in their 
opinions about cucumbers, fome thinking them 
abfolutely unwholefome, while others praife them 
above meafure. The truth is, they are hard of 
digeftion of themfelve.s are apt to rife in the fto- 
mach, and cool too much. However, they arc 
very good in the hot fcurvy,by abating the acrimo- 
ny of the humours, and by abforbing the hurtful 
falts of the blood. When they are ftafoned with a 
little vinegar, oil, and pepper, they fit eaiyon the 
ftomach, and are attended with no bad confequen- 
ces, let a peribn's age be what it will. A famous 
author, and fkilful herbalift, continued eating thefn 
till fixty, without the lead inconvenience, and did 
not leave them off then. The making them be- 
tween two plates, to get out the juice, is a fuper- 
fluous labour, for it is not at all noxious. 

Of GOURDS. 

The pulp or fleih of a gourd was faid by the 
antients to be nothing but coagulated water. It is 
cold, moift, yields little or no nourilhment, relaxes 
the flomach-, and take away the defire of drinking. 
Therefore it may be ufeful to the hot, and is no- 
xious to the cold. But as it has a dead infipid 
tafte, is is feldom brought to the table. 

Of C i T R u L s. 

Citruls have a near relation to gourds, and the pulp 
is eaten either raw or boiled. It yields little nou- 
rifliment, renders the blood watry,abates the inflam- 
mation of the internal parts, and temperates the teat 
of the bile. Thofe that think it worth their trouble, 
cook them in various manners, and boil, fry, or 
roafted them with butter, fait, onions, fpices, and 
fugar They are bed in hot weather, for thgfe that 
are young and of a bilious conftitution.

Of ORANGES. 

Thofe oranges are bed which grow in hot coun- 
tries, for the fur, renders the juice more mellow and 
fit for ufe. The pulp of China-oranges is cooling, 
quenches third, and helps the appetite. The juice 
of Seville-oranges is acid, and much more whole- 
fome for fauce, or to make punch, than that of 
lemons \ though no acids are good for coughs and 
confumptions. Being diluted with water, and 
fweetened with fugar, it makes Orangeat, which 
is a very agreeable drink in hot weather, to quench 
thirft, to temperate the heat of the blood, and is 
very ufetul in levers, as alfo for thofe that are trou- 
bled with the fcurvy. The peel helps digeftion, 
ftrengthens the ftomach, renders the humours fluid, 
cifcuifes wind, eafes the colic, promotes womens 
monthly courfes, and kills worms. The rind of 
orange peel,either dry or frem,made into a tincture 
with fpirit of wine, is very good for the famepurpo- 
fes,and makes a very good bitter. Thirty grains of 
the peel;reduccd to powder,may be taken at a dofe. 

Of CITRONS and LEMONS. 

Citrons are not ufed as aliment, but as fauce, 
being cut into quarters, and fqueezed over meat, 
having-both an agreeable tafte and fmell. The juice 
is an agreeable acid, excites an appetite and helps 
digeftion, provided the ufe of it be moderate. It 
is cooling, promotes urine, and is excellent in the 
fcdr'vy. It Hops vomiting caufed by bilious hu- 
mours, and is good in palpitations of the heart. 
The. outward yellow peel has a fine aromatick 
fmell, 'being full of effcntial oil : being chewed, it 
mends the breath, by its bitternefs it ftrengthens 
the'ftomach, kills worms, difcufies wind, and di- 
gefts crude humours in the ftomach and inteftines. 
Lemons are akin to citrons, but the juice is more 

four, 



The Art ofCooKERY* 231 

four, and confequently more cooling. It is put to 
the lame uies as citron or orange juice, but is lefs 
iriendly to the nerves, and is more apt to iritate the 
lungs to coughing. Lemons are lels than citrons, 
the peel is thinner, and the juice in greater plenty. 
The peel has the fame virtues. The juice, water, 
and fugar make lemonade or fherbet. 

Of RAISINS and CURRANTS. 
Raifms and currants are of the fame nature, and 
abound with a fweet juice,which is very nourishing. 
They keep the body open when ftoned, increale 
the appetite, are good in difeafes of the breaft, and 
cure a hoarfenefs. Eaten with their ftones, they 
are more binding, help digeftion, and are good in 
fluxes. They are bad in inflammatory fevers, be- 
caufe they increafe the effervefcence of the humours. 
Their too frequent ufe is bad ior the gums, and 
diipofes them to grow rotten. 

Of MULBERRIES. 

Mulberries, before they are ripe, are rough and 
aftringent, and are ufed in gargles for ulcers of the 
mouth, and diforders of the throat. When they 
are ripe, they are cooling, moiftening, quench 
third, open the body, foften the humours of the 
breaft, and promote expectoration or fpitting. 
They are apt to be windy, are bad in the colic, and 
to cold and moift conftitutions. 

Of MEDLARS. 

Medlars are fit to gather in September, but they 
feldom grow ripe on the tree, and therefore they 
are laid on ftraw, till they grow fbft, and are fit to 
eat, otherwife they would be hurtful to the flomach, 
to which at the belt they are not very friendly. They 
are faid to flop vomiting, to be good in fluxes, and 
to prevent drunkenefs. The riper they are the lefs 
aftrineent they become.

Cf S E R V I C E S. 

There is a great affinity between fervices and 
medlars, and they have much the fame properties ; 
for they are aftrir.gent, ftop vomiting, fluxes, ex- 
cefTive bleedings, and help an offenfive breath. 
They mould be ripe, well tailed, and of an agree- 
able fmell. They do not ripen on the tree like 
other fruits, but are gathered in the autumn, and 
laid u'pon ftraw, till, from being hard, rough, dif- 
agreeable, they become foft. fweet, and delicious. 
They are proper in the winter for hot conftitu- 
tions, and a weak ftomach, provided they are uled 
moderately ; for if they are eaten to excels, they 
breed grofs humours, ferment in the ftomach and 
guts, caufmg colics and gripings. 

Of BARBERRIES. 

Barberries are rather a medicine than an aliment, 
and are accounted cooling and binding. They 
reftrain the effervefcence of the humours caufed by 
the fharpnefs and heat of the gall , they cure bilious 
fluxes, ftrengthen the ftomach and inteftines, refto- 
re a decayed appetite, are helpful in fluxes, and 
ftop bleeding from the acrimony of the humours, 
and the difTolution of the blood. They are not 
proper for thofe that are troubled with a pain in the 
ftomach, or who are afflicted with, or who have 
a weak breaft or a difficulty of breathing. 

Of W A L N u T s. 

Walnuts have an agreeable tafle while they are 
new, but in proportion as they grow old they be- 
come oily, rancid, difagreeable, and prejudicial to 
health. The exceffive ufe of the beft, will caufe a 
itubborn coftivenefsj and bring on the iliac pafilon. 

They 



Art of COOKERY. 233 

They are hard of digeftion, occafion a cough, 
bring on a hoarfenefs, and a heavinefs of the head. 
When they are dry, they mould be fteeped in wa- 
ter, and then the fkin will readily come off. 

O/FILBERDS and HAZLE-NUTS. 

Filberds and hazle-nuts are more nouriming than 
walnuts, and they are befl when they are not quite 
ripe, becaule they are then more moifi, and more 
agreeable to the palate , but they are never digeil- 
ed in the ftomach. When they are full ripe, and 
have been kept fometime,they become more whole- 
fome. When they are eaten too freely, they ren- 
der the head heavy ; and if they are taken foon after 
a meal, they caufe thirft, and a troublefome infla- 
tion. It is a common opinion, that they caufe 
Ihortnefs of breath, and bring on the afthma. 

Of ALMONDS. 

Frelh fweet almonds are nourifhing,but not much, 
and they fit heavy on the ftomach of many whole 
digeftive faculty is weak. Therefore the beft way 
is to chew them very fmall, otherwife they will pals 
unchanged through the body. They are given to 
lick perfons to thicken thin humours, to render 
thofe that are fharp foft, and to reftore the flefh of 
thofe that are in a wafte and a confumption. They 
mould be chofen frefh,not rancid,yellow and fmooth 
outwardly, not wrinkled, very white within, and of 
a fweet agreeable tafte. An emulfion made with 
fweet almonds is given in burning fevers, watching, 
heat of urine, inflammations of the kidneys and 
bladder, all forts of pains, fluxes, and bleedings. 
Bitter almonds are feldom ufed inwardly, and the 
oil that is exprefied from them is like oil of fweet 
almonds. They are poifon to dogs, foxes, and 
many other animals which die in convulfions.

Of PISTACHIO-NUTS. 

Piftachio-nuts mould be chofen heavy, full, 
frefh, of an agreeable fmell, and a fweet aroma- 
tic tafte. They are agreeable to the palate and 
ftomach, and yield plenty of nourimment, but 
fomewhat grofs. They are reftorative, and very 
proper for thofe that are emaciated, or have loll 
their flefli. They are opening, ftrengthening the 
ftomach and other bowels. They are good in 
coughs and confuraptions, becaufe they abate the 
acrimony of the humours. When they are ufed 
immoderately,they are faid to be heating, otherwife 
they agree with all conftitutions. 

Of PINE-APPLE KERNELS. 

Pine-apple kernels mould be frefh, large, white, 
and tender. They are very nourifhing, but a little 
hard of digeftionj they are ufeful to lean comfump- 
tive people, becaufe they cleanfe the lungs, and 
heal the ulcers. They likewife fheath the falts of 
the blood and humours, and on that account are 
good in heat of urine, and flranguaries, as well as 
in ulcers of the kidneys and bladder. They in- 
creafe milk, and the feminal fluid. 

Of CHESNUTS. 

Chefnuts are never eaten raw, but roafted either 
in a pan over the fire, or under the afhes. In fome 
mountainous countries they are ufed inftead of bread: 
However, let them be cooked which way they 
will, they are windy, hard of digeftion, yield grofs 
nourimment, and are fit only for thofe that are 
ftrong, and lead a laborious life. Therefore they 
fhould be ufed with great moderation, efpecially 
by thofe that are troubled with the gravel, the co- 
lic,

He, and obftruftions of the bowels. However, they 
are good in fluxes, and for thofe that fpit blood. 

Of OLIVES. 

Olives, before they are pickled, are rough, bit- 
ter, and have a very naufeous tafte ; but after they 
are prepared with fait, vinegar, and water, they arc 
agreeable enough, efpecially to thofe who are ao 
cuflomed to eat them. They ferve to whet the 
appetite, to ftrengthen the ftomach, and to free it 
from grofs plegm. They are very innocent, for 
they produce no bad effects, unlefs ufed to excefs. 
However, pickled olives are not agreeable to every 
palate ; and I have known fome take a great deal 
of pains to conquer their averfion to them, becaufe 
they would be in the fafhion. 

Of DATES. 

Dates are the fruit of a palm-tree which grow in 
Arabia, Syria, Africa, and other places, in fome 
of which they are ufed inftead of bread. It is laid 
the beft are brought to us from Tunis, which are 
fold at high price, and are ufed only as a fweet- 
meat. Therefore their virtues as an aliment are 
not worth mentioning. They are a little binding, 
ftrengthen the ftomach and are good in fluxes of aH 
kinds. They are good in coughs, thin catarrhs, 
and meath the (harpnefs of the humours. They 
are ufeful to cleanfe the lungs, and bring up the 
obftructing matter without difficulty. 

Of CAPERS. 

The capers that are brought to us are pickled, 
and borrow their tafte from the liquor with which 
they are prepared. They ferve to excite a languid 
appetite, but are of themfelves difficult of digeftion. 

Some

Some give them a beautiful green colour by pickling 
them in a copper veffel, and by that means infed 
them with the poifonous quality of that metal. 
Therefore they mould not be chofen of too lively a 
colour, for then they may juftly be fufpected. 

Of BEANS. 

There are feveral forts of beans, but they are all 
of the fame nature, and therefore need not be treat- 
ed of diftin&ly. They are hard of digeftion, and 
are very proper food for perfons who undergo 
hard labour, becaufe they yield plenty of grofs nou- 
rifliment ; but are too ftrong for thofe that lead fe- 
dentary in active lives. They are windy, difteiad 
the belly, breed the colic, render the head heavy, 
the fight dull, and blunt the faculties of the minds. 
Moft are fond of young beans, but they are not fo 
wholefome as thofe that are old, however agree- 
able they may be to the palate. They mould not 
be eaten at all by thofe of delicate conftitutions, 
or who are troubled with the ftone, the colic, a pain 

in the head, or coftivenefs. 


Of PEASE. 

Peafe are a very common aliment, and yield 
plenty of nourimment, which agrees very well with 
perfons of a robuft conftitution, and who ufe much 
exercife. When they are green and young, they are 
much eafier of digeftion than when they are old 
and dry. They are laxative, windy, and unfit for 
weak ftomachs. They are of great ufe for fea-fa- 
ring people, becaufe when they come on more, 
after long voyages, and eat raw green peafe, they 
yield great relief in the fcurvy. They agree very 
well with perfons of all conftitutions whofe ftomachs 
will digeft them.

Of KIDNEY-BEANS. 

Some give kidneys-beans the name of French 
beans, but improperly. When thefe are young, and 
boiled in the pods, they yield good nourimment, 
and are more eafy of digeftion than peafe, agreeing 
well with mod conftitutions. Some fay they arc 
heating, and moft fuitable to the young and robuft \ 
but if we con ful t experience, we fhall never find 
any complaints from the ufe of them ; which is the 
greateft demonftration of their being wholefome. 
They are opening, emollient, promote urine, and 
are good in the gravel. 

Of L E N T i L s. 

Lentils are in no efleem for food among us," 
though in fome countries they live upon them, 
where they can get nothing better. If they were 
fown in the fields, they would make a fodder for 
cattle, 

Of RICE. 

Rice ferves inflead of bread in the greateft part 
of Africa and Afia, being the chief and almoft only 
aliment in fome countries -, therefore we muft be 
obliged to defert the opinions of fome phyficians, 
who pretend to talk of its bad qualities. It is very 
temperate, yields wholefome nourimment, and is 
thought to be a little binding, but not fo much as 
to produce any inconvenience. Perhaps the fmail 
degree of this quality, may be owing to its fhea- 
thing fharp humours in the ftomach and interlines. 
It is very proper nourimment for thofe that are 
brought low by lofs of blood, as well as for con- 
fumptive and heclic patients, becaufe there is no- 
thing more eSicacious to abate the acrimony of 
the blood,

Of GROATS and OATMEAL. 

Oatmeals is groats coarfely ground $ and groats 
are decorticated oats. Thefe are good in coughs, 
fheath the acrimony of the blood, temperate heat 
and carry off hurtful falts by the urinary paflages. 
Water-gruel has the fame ufes, and may be drank 
in catarrhs, hoarfenefs, coughs, roughnefs of the 
throat, and when there are fmall ulcers therein 5 
as well as in all acute fevers, and other diforders 
that require a low diet. 

Of MILLET. 

Millet is a fmall feed brought from the eaftern 
parts of the world, and is much efteemed by fome 
for making of puddings. It is ufed as aliment, in 
ibme countries, boiled in milk. It is faid to be 
emollient, cooling, and anodyne, to be ufeful in 
obftinate coughs, and diforders of the breaft. Ic 
is not fo good as rice. 

Of BARLEY. 

Barley, in whatever manner prepared, never 
heats the body, but is cooling and cleanfing. It 
is moiftening when boiled, and drying when par- 
ched. Some people formerly made bread of bar- 
ley, as they do at prefent in times of dearth. Ic 
is not fo nourifhing as wheat, is harder of digeftion, 
and yields lefs aliment. Pearl barley made into a 
ptifan with water, has much the fame virtues as 
water gruel, but is not quite fo nouriming. 

Of BREAD. 

Bread is commonly made of wheat- flour reduced 
into dough with water and yeaft, and baked in an 

oven.

oven. It is an aliment that no nation is without, 
except the Tartars, who neglect it entirely, and 
neither have bread, nor any thing to anfwer its ufe. 
I do no mean that other nations have this compofi- 
tion in the fame manner with us, but that they ufe 
fome vegetable which anfwers the fame purpofe. 
Thus the Indians and Chinefe fubftitute rice, the 
Arabians near the Euphrates dates, and the Cir- 
caffians a certain fmall feed which they call Gom. 
Bread is fo neceflary with us, that we know not how- 
to live without it, becaufe we eat it with almoft 
every thing elfe. 

We are told that in the early ages, men made 
bread of acorns, as they do at prefent of dates and 
chefnuts. In America they ufe a root called cafla- 
vi, and in our plantations Indian corn. In the 
Molucca iflands they make it of the pith of a tree, 
and call it fagoe. The Laplanders dry their fifh 
for the fame purpofe, as do fome of the inhabitants 
in the Gulph of Arabia. But we, in thefe parts of 
the world/ prefer wheat bread to all others, as moft 
agreeable to our conflitutions. Some make their 
bread of rye, and fome of wheat and rye mixt, 
which renders it more laxative, but it is not fo 
nouriming. Barley bread, as was obferved above, 
does not afford fuch plenty of aliment, nor is it fo 
wholefome as wheat, and therefore it is not eaten 
where the other fort is to be had. In fome parts 
of this ifland, they live upon oat-cakes inftead of 
bread; but this food difturbs perfpiration,and makes 
them fubject to difeafes of the Ikin. In Italy they 
make a pafte with wheat-flour, water, fugar, faf- 
fron, and the yolks of eggs, which are formed in 
threads like worms j and this they call vermicelly : 
thisferve with us to make foupsj it fhould be cho- 
fen frefh, dry, and of a good colour.

hard of digeilion, yield little nourifhment, breed 
melancholy, puff up the belly, fill the head with 
fumes, dull the fenfes, and caufe troublefome 
dreams. But confult thofe who live very much 
upon them, and you will find no fuch effects : be- 
fides, the antient Romans for fix hundred years

wever, we cannot deny but fome particular perfons 
may find cabbage difagree with them, and fo they 
may any thing elfe. Experience, in this cafe, is the 
only judge, and it will be no hard matter toab- 
Itain from any aliment we find prejudicial to our 
health. Broth or foup made with cabbage keeps 
the body open. 

C/ARTICHOAK.S. 

Artichoaks are eafy of digeftion, and by a fmall

they are cordial, open obftruclions, cleanfe the 
blood, and promote urine. They are never to be 
eaten raw, for then they have bad effects. 

Of ASPARAGUS. 

Afparagus excites the appetite, promotes urine, 
to which it communkares a ftrong fmell, and yields 
but little nourifhment. When taken to excels, it

cleanfe the blood, and render it more fluid, whence 
it is thought to be a remedy againft breakings out, 
and other diforders of the fkin. The ufe of hops 
to preferve malt liquors, and to render them more 
palatable is known to all the world. 

'.Of LETTUCES. 

Lettuces are of feveral forts, but the virtues are 
nearly the fame. They are good to appeafe the 
heat and commotions of the humours, to allay the 
heat of the ftomach, liver, kidneys, and other 
bowels : they likewife relax their fibres, when 
they are too crifp and tenfe ; infomuch that by re- 
ftoring their functions, they procure fleep. They 
foften the belly, and are good for thofe that are 
fubjecl: to coftivenefs, either eaten raw or boiled ; 
as alfo for thofe that are troubled with the fcurvy, 
vapours or 4 hypochondriac and melancholy difeafes. 
If they produce any badjeffects at all, it muft be to 
thofe that are of weak phlegmatic conftitutions.

ftrengthens the folids, promotes the fecretions, 
gives a frefh colour to the face y abates the heat of 
the bowels from obltruclions with (harp humours. 
Hence it is good in thejaundice, cachexy, quinfy,

Borrage is a temperate herb, and yet it is cordial' 
chears the fpirits, and drives away melancholy* 
It cleanfes the blood, renders it more fluid, opens 
obftructions, promotes urine, and helps expecto- 
ration. It is good in all internal heats, which tend 
to an inflammation, in the palpitation of the heart, 
cachexy,and fuppreflion of the monthly courfes from 
thick humours, when hotter medicines would do 
harm. Buglofs is aftringent, and good in all forts 
of bleedings, fpitting of blood, the bloody flux, 
and the whites in women. As alfo in bruifes, falls, 
internal wounds, and ulcers. Thefe herbs are ge- 
nerally mixt together to put into a cool tankard.

Mint is of feveral forts, but but they have all 
the fame general virtues. They are of excellent 
ule to reitore the faculties of the ftomach, to help 
digeftion, to ftop vomiting, and to prevent any 
thing from rifing after 'it is eaten. They are ufe- 
ful to promote urine, to eafe the wind colic, to 
open obftructions of the bowels, and confequently

abates the heat of the bowels, corrects choler, 
quenches thirft, whets the appetite, and refills pu- 
trefaction. It is alfo ufeful in fevers, efpecially of 
the peftilential fort. It makes a very ufeful fauce in 
hot feafons, and agrees beft with perfons of a hot 
conflitution.

This is a fallad herb, but is not very eafy of 
digeftion, efpecially if eaten in too large a quan- 
tity. It is good againft the gravel, and is very 
ferviceable againft bleedings of every kind : for 
which purpofe it may be given in decoctions or 
powder, after it has been dried in the made. 

Of P A R s E L y. 

The leaves and roots of it are in ufe ; the chief 
virtues are to open obstructions of the bowels, to 
promote urine, to cleanfe the kidneys, and to dif- 
cufs wind. They have a tendency to promote wo- 
mens monthly courfes, and to drive back the milk, 
the leaves being bruifed, and laid to the breads. 
The free ufe of it caufes diforders of the head, unlefs

Leeks have been cenfured as being pernicious 
aliment, but without reafon when they are boiled ; 
for then they agree very well with perfons who have 
thick grofs humours, with phlegmatic conftitu-

the menfes, and fometimes cure barrennefs. A 
fyrup made with it, is good to promote expectora- 
tion, and is ferviceable in the moift afthma. 

Of ONIONS, SHALOTS, and CHIVES. 

Onions are eaten raw by many perfons, efpecially 
failors and country people, which makes their 
breath ofFenfive. This may be avoided by boiling 
them i for then they lofe their acrid tafte and 
fmell. They revive a languid appetite, and agree 
with a ftomach that abounds with thick cold clam- 
my humours. They promote urine and the men- 
fes, but yield little nourimment. When eaten top 
freely, they caufe third, pains in the head, 
and excite troublefome dreams. They are provo- 
catives, inflame the blood, and are hurtful tpj 
bilious conftitutions. Shalots have the fame tfFedis 
with onions, though in a lefler degree, for they arq 
milder. Chives are of the fame nature as the for- 
mer, but are not fo ftrong. They are fometimes 
mixt with fallads to quicken their tafte. They are 
not eafily digefted, for which reafon they fill the 
ftomach with wind.

Garlick is very much ufed in fome nations, while 
others have it in great abhorrence. It yields very 
little nourifhment, and that not good. It is no 
way fuitable to perfons of warm or bilious confli- 
tutions, but may be allowed to perfons of weak 
flomachs, to help digeflion and excite the appetite. 
Soldiers, failors, and rufticks are free with it to 
correct bad aliment. It refills putrefaction, pro- 
motes urine, cleanfes the kidneys, cures the wind- 
colic, and kills worms. It promotes expectora- 
tion in the moift afthma, and will fometimes carry 
off the water in a dropfy. The too frequent ufe of 
garlick inflames the flomack and bowels, creates 
third, heats the blood, breeds wind, caufes the 
head-ach, and hurts the eyes. The juice is good 
for burns. Rocambole has the fame properties, 
but weaker. 

Of CHERVIL. 

Chervil is a fallad herb very agreeable to 
the fmell, palate, and ftomach. It is opening, 
attenuating, and inciding ; promotes urine, clean- 
fes the kidneys, brings down the menfes, opens 
obftructions of the bowels, diffolves cloned blood 
occafioned by falls, heals diforders of the fkin, is 
very ufeful in chronic difeafes, and performs won- 
ders in the dropfy. In thefe cafes, three or four 
ounces of the juice muft be taken every third or 
fourth hour.

It is of great ufe in the kitchen as a wholefome 
herb, which agrees well with perfons of a weak 
ftomach, with the phlegmatic and the old. It 
heats too much for thofe of a bilious conftitution, 
and therefore they mould ufe it cautioufly. 

Of CRESSES. 

Garden crefles is much ufed in fallads, becaufe it 
js not only agreeable to the tafte, but promotes the 
digeftion of the reft, by ftrengtheningthe ftomach. 
It incides grofs humours, and opens obftructions of 
the liver, Ipleen, and womb. Befides which, it is

Of MUSHROOMS or CHAMPIGNONS. 

i. 

When mufhrooms or champignons that are fit to 
cat, firft appear out of the earth, they are round 
like a button, and afterwards open by little and little, 
mewing the red or flelh coloured part underneat 
confiding of thin membranes or plates : the upper 
part is fmooth and white, and the infide or flefh, 
when broke, is exceeding white : the ftalk is fhort 
and thick. Before they begin to open, the tafte 
and fmell is good, which is the beft time for gather- 
ing them ; becaufe when they are old, they have 
a ftrong fmell, and change to a dark colour. They 
rife fpontaneoufly in the fields and woods,generally 
after rain. The gardeners have a method of raifing 
them from beds of horfe-dung. There is a poi- 
fonous fort which are often miftaken for the former, 
and even the wholefome have bad effects, if eaten 
too freely. When any are poifoned with them, the 
beft remedy is large quantities of milk and oil.

Of MORELS. 

A morel is a kind of early champignon, which 
is fometimes of the fize of a walnut, and is pitted on 
the outfide like a honey-comb. This is the fweet- 
eft and bed of all fungous fubftances; it excites the 
appetite, increafes the motion of the blood, and 
revives the fpirits, but yields little nourimment. 
The frequent ufe of it is faid to be hurtful to hot 
coriftitutions. 

Of TRUFFLES. 

A truffle is a kind of fungus, found in the earth, 
which hogs are very fond of, and in fome places 
they difcover them by their means. It has neither 
roots nor leaves, is rough and dark coloured with- 
out, but white and fiefhy within. Some have been 
found of a pound weight ; but the beft are middle 
fized, pli mp, hard, ot a iwcetifh tafte, and agreea- 
ble fmell. They are faid to be reftorative, provoca- 
tive, to ftrengthen the ftomach, and to agree beft 
with cold conftitutions. They may be round in 
greareft plenty after rain in the autumn. 

Of POTATOES. 

Potatoes were originally brought from America, 
but not from Virginia as fome have afferted -, for 
their potatoes are as long as a child's leg and thigh, 
and not unlike them in flhape, being probably what 
are called Spanifh potatoes. The French call them 
topinumboes, from a country near the river of the 
Amazons, from whence they had them. They 
lif.ewib grow wild in Brafil. No root ever came fo 
much into ufe as this, for fome poor people almoft 
live upon them a great part of the year ; which is a 

t monftration they are very nourifhing,without any

bad qualities. They are proper aliment to abate 
the acrimony of the blood and humours, as alfo to 
help the disorders of the breaft and lungs. It is 
pity we have no account who it was that firft 
brought them into England. 

Of the RADISH and HORSE-RADISH. 

Common radifhes are only fit for ufe r when they 
are young, and eafily broken. They promote 
urine, cleanfe the kidneys, and whet the appetite ;. 
but they are apt to rife again on the ftomach, which 
is very difagreeabk ta many. Horfc radifh is ufed 
only as a fauce to aliments, but may be made good 
ufe of in phyfick upon many occafions. It cleanies 
the ftomach, promotes urine, and is good in the 
dropfy, the fcurvy, a hoarfenefs, and a moiffc 
cough. The decoction of horf-radifh in milk, is 
excellent for the wandring gout, and old rheuma- 
tic pains. It muft be taken for a month early in a 
morning in bed, and the dofe may be increased or 
dirninifhed according to its effect ; outwardly 
made into a liniment, it is good in palfies of the 
limbs and pains of the fcurvy. 

Of TURNERS. 

Good turneps contain an oily balfamick juice, 
very ufeful to abforb the acrid falts of the blood and 
humours ; and therefore yield very proper nourifh- 
ment for thofe that are young, or to hot conftitu- 
tions. The water that is fq.ueezed out of boiled 
turneps, fweetened with fugar, is very good for a 
hoarfenefs and difeafes of the lungs. Turneps are 
a little windy, efpecially when the ftomach is 
weak. 



<Tbe Art of COOKERY. 

Of CARROTS and PARSNIPS. 



Carrots and parfnips are very ufeful roots, be- 
caufe they are very temperate, nourifhing, and 
agreeable to all ages and conflitutions. However, 
fome have a natural antipathy to parfnips, while 
others are as extravagantly fond of them. Some 
affirm, when parfnips are too old, they diflurb the 
brain; hence in fome countries they are called 
Madnips. 



Skirrets are the moft agreeable and wholefomeft 
root that is planted in gardens, for which reafon it 
is pity they are not more common. They mould 
be chofen tender, eafy to break, and of a fweet 
tafte. They are nourifhing, opening, provocative, 
increafe the appetite, and agree with all ages and 
conftitutions. They are one of the bcft remedies 
for fpitting and piffing of blood, as alfo in the be- 
ginning of a confumption, a ftrangury, tenefmus, 
and a bloody flux. They may be boiled in milk 
or whey, and ufed conftantly for diet. 

Of MUSTARD-SEED. 

Muftard is very good to help digeftion, to 
quicken the appetite, to thin grofs humours in the 
flomach, and is proper for phlegmatic conftitutions, 
and perfons in years. The feed, as a medicine, is 
good in the fcurvy, cachexy, green ficknefs, hypo- 
chondriac, fleepy difeafes, and the rheumatifm. 



<The Art of COOKERY. 251 

Of SPICES. 

Nutmegs help digeftion, ftop vomiting, difculs 
wind, cafe colic-pains, abate loofenefles, and arc 
good in cold diforders of the nerves ; but too free 
a ufe of them, is bad for the head. Mace is a cover- 
ing of the nutmeg, and has the fame virtues. 
Black-pepper and Long-pepperzre heating,drying and 
opening. They ftrengthen the ftomach, clear the 
fpirits, render grofs humours thin, and increafe the 
motion of the blood. They are very ufeful for cold 
ftomachs, and the cold temperature of the brain ; 
but difpofe the ftomach and bowels to inflamma- 
tion by heating the blood and humours. Cinnamon is 
the belt of all fpices,being ftrengthening,reftorative, 
and good in diforders of the nerves and brain: 
whence it is good in loofenefles, the wind-colic, 
the green ficknefs, and palfey ; but as it heats the 
blcod and humours, it moft be ufed with mode- 
ration. Cloves, like other fpices, have a heating and 
drying faculty,are good in weaknefs of the ftomach, 
the wind-colic, and all cold difeafes, efpecially 
when they arife from a defect of motion : they are 
very good againft c>ld difeafes of the head, and 
venereal impotency. Ginger ftrengthens the fto- 
mach, efpecially when it abounds with acid grofs 
humours. It is good in all moift diforders, forti- 
fies the brain, helps digeftion, difcufles wind, and 
is a provocative. This, as well as all other fpices, 
are not agreeable to hot bilious conftitutions. 

Of SUGAR. 

Sugar is the effential fait of the fugar can, and 
a natural foap which will mix with or unite oil and 
water. Hence it helps digeftion, cleanfes the lungs, 
promotes urine, and is good in a hoarfenefs and 

coughs. 



252 The Art of COOK E& y. 

coughs. It never generates phlegm, but is good 
in a fcurvy and all putrid difeafes, the leprofy, and 
bloody flux. It is no enemy to the teeth as has 
been commonly fuppofed, nor breeds an acid till 
after fermentation. Mixt with brandy, it heals 
wounds, cleanfes ulcers, and prevents putrefaction. 

Of SALT. 

Common fait is of great ufe to prevent the putre- 
faction of aliments, and to reftrain the heat of the 
humours of the body ; it abates the fharpnefs of 
the fluids,and tend to carry the noxious particles off 
by urine. It helps digeftion, prevent coftivenefs, 
and procures an appetite : but faked meat breeds 
the flone, caufes the fcurvy, fcabs, and the lepro- 
fy, caufing great heat throughout the body, and 
hurtine; all the functions.

digeftion eafy. WATER is the principal, the m oft 
wholefome, and moft necefiary for life. Soft wa- 
ter is beft,which may be known by its lathering rea- 
dily with foap, and is the greateft diflblvent in na- 
ture , for which reafon it will cure many indifpofi- 
tions -, but ufed too conftantly and freely, it relaxes 
and weakens the folids, and brings cachexies, drop- 
fies, and other difeafes. 

WINE is never prejudicial to health, but when 
ufed too freely, or in a morning as a whet, and 
then it hardens the fibres, hurts the nerves', dimi- 

nifhes 



The Art of COOKERY. 253 

nifties the fecretions, deftroys the appetite, and 
caufes tedious chronical difeafes. The fame may 
be faid of rum, brandy, and other fpirituous li- 
quors. Wine drank moderately, ftrengthens the 
ftomach, procures digeftion,chears the fpirits,warms 
the imagination, helps the memory, invigorates 
the blood, paffes off by urine, and is a principal 
remedy in low nervous fevers. 

MALT-LIQUORS that are fine, clear, and light, 
are grateful to the ftomach, pafs offeafily and free- 
ly by urine. They do not create a heavinefs of the 
head, nor a fournefs of the ftomach, nor fill the 
body with wind : this depends greatly on the good- 
nefs of the water, the boiling the ingredients in a 
due manner, and caufing it to undergo a proper 
fermentation. 

VINEGAR is aftringent and cooling, a fmall 
quantity whets the appetite, helps digeftion, cor- 
rects the bile, and is excellent againft the plague 
and other contagious difeafes ; but taken in large 
quantities, it hurts the nerves, is pernicious to 
thofe that are lean and fpare, to thofe that have 
weak breads, that are troubled with a cough, that 
have a difficulty of breathing, or are troubled with 
melancholy disorders. Many perfons who have 
drank vinegar, to make them lean, have fallen into 
incurable confumptions. It agrees beft with hot 
conftitutions. 

CIDER : When it is ftrqng, fweet, and rich, has 
much the fame qualities as wine, but it is not fo 
heating, and quenches thirft better. It is likewife 
of greater ufe in the fcurvy, and to prevent the 
breeding of the ftone and gravel, for this difeafe is 
-feldom known where they drink little elfe but 
cider. Rough cider is more aftringent, and as 

o B o 

fome think more conducive to health ; but neither 
kind will agree with fome conftitutions, which can 
be only known by experience.

but when it is geod, it comes neareft the nature of 
white wine. 

MEAD ftrengthens the ftomach, excites the ap- 
petite, chears the fpirits, helps the breathing, is 
good in coughs and the wind colic. When it is 
new, it fits heavy on the ftomach, and often cau- 
fcs vomiting. 

CHOCOLATE is very nourifhing, reftorative, and 
proper to re-eftablifh the ftrength and vigour ; it 
helps digeftion, foftens Iharp humours that offend 
the lungs, is provocative and refifts the malignity 
of humours. 

COFFEE ftrengthens the ftomach and brain, clears 
the head, helps digeftion, and reprefies the fumes 
of wine ; but in fome it hinders deep, and caufes a 
trembling of the nerves. 

TEA is good in difeafes of head and nerves, pre- 
vents fleepinefs, chears the fpirits, reprefles vapours, 
helps digeftion, promotes urine, purifies the blood, 
and promotes perfpiratton.

Of DISEASES, and their CURES. 

ABORTION, or MISCARRIAGE, is the exclufion 
of an Embryo, Foetus^ or child before it come to 
maturity, or before the due time. However, a 
child that is born five or fix weeks before the ufual te:m, 
may, by due care, and good nurfmg, be preferved alive. 
The moft common time of mifcarriage, is from the be- 
ginning of the third month, to the end of the fourth. The 
Signs of its approach are coldnefs, and fhivering, a preffing 
pain in the loins, reaching to the bottom of the belly, pro- 
ceeding to the bones oppofite to it behind, as alfo to the 
groin, with a ftronger beating of the pulfe. It is likewife 
preceded with the coming away of bloody water, bleeding, 
<#r flooding, till the mifcarriage is completed. Add to 
thefe, that the belly becomes flat, the infant ceafes to air, 
and the breads are fofter than ufual and flabby, with a de- 
i(ke of going to (tool. 

When a mifcarriage is apprehended, or fear'd, keep the 
body open the firft months with manna or rhubarb, bleed 
In the arm in the third, and give the bark two or three 
t;imes a day for a week. When the f\ mptoms of abortion 
to appear, then bleeding is abioiutely neceflary ; after

which, give three ounces of linfeed oil. When coughing 
is like to caufe abortion, give fix grains of the ftorax pills 
at night, going to bed. When there is a flux of blood from 
the genital parts, then mix equal parts of roch alum and 
dragon's blood, and make them into a fine powder, giving 
the patient half a dram of it every hour, till it ceafes. It 
may be given in a draught, or be made into a bolus with 
conferve of rofes. It will tfop, if at all, in feven hours. 

ABSCESS. When an inflammation has caufed an ex- 
travafation of the blood, it fometimes turns into a puru- 
lent fubftance, and forms an abfcefs or impofthume, which 
is .nothing elfe but a great collection of purulent matter in 
Come particular part 1'hefe abfcefles vary according to the 
parts in which they are feated, and particularly as they 
are either external or internal ; and which are to be diftin- 
guifhed by fome peculiar figns. In general, all large 
abTcefles, in whatever part they are concealed, are attend- 
ed with a flow quotidian fever, with a remiflion and 
exacerbation, a weak quick pulfe, which foon impairs 
the ftrength and preys upon the juices : hence proceed 
nocturnal fweats, and a univerfal decay of the whole body, 

^mietimes an impofthume lies hid between the perito- 
naeum and the mufcles of the abdomen, and is known 
by a fixt pain, and a hard tumour, remaining there a long 
while, which may be often brought to a head by an 
emollient cataplafm. Sometimes a pleurify, an inflamma- 
tion of the lungs, a grievous fall, the meafles or fmall 
pox, will leave an abfcefs in the thorax or cheft, attended 
with an obtufe preffing pain, an inexpreflible anxiety, a. 
difficulty of breathing, a cough in the night, a quick lan- 
guid pulfe, a falling away of the body, particularly of the 
parts about the breafts, and the patient cannot bear to lie 
on the well fide. When the vefiels break, and the matter 
falls upon the diaphragm, it is called an Empyema ; which is 
attended with an intolerable pain near the loins. But it 
muft be obferved that all inflammations of the lungs ojT 
pleura, are followed by an adheiion of thofe parts : fof 
which reafon it is corrimon for abfcefles of the pleura and 
intercoftal mufcles to break outwardly, and is not uncom- 
mon for the lungs to do the fame. In this cafe, the tu- 
mour muft be opened with a lancet, when the pus is fof- 
med ] and if the difcharge is plentiful and conftant> that 

the 



The FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 5 

the ul'cer will not admit healing, it muft be kept open 
with an hollow tent. 

While the purulent matter is contained in a bag, it is called 
a Vcmica ; and then there is a fixt lafting comprefiing pain ill 
the breaft, with a quick pulfe, a dry cough, a ftinking 
breath, a falling away, a lofs of itrength, a want of ap- 
petite, and a debilitating fweat. VVhen this Vomica breaks, 
the patient will fometimes cough up a plerty of matter. 

An abfcefs in the mef-ntery, or membrane that ties the 
guts together, is attended with a weight, without any great 
pain or tumour, a flow fever, frequent fainting, with a 
cold fweat. Sometimes the purulent matter is voided by 
ftool. Sometimes the abfcefs breaks into the cavity of the 
abdomen, and produces intolerable pains, and other hor- 
rid fymptoms, particularly a fever, a tumour, and a 
conftant urging to make water. An abfcefs in the back, 
between the peritonaeum and the pfoa-i mufcle, has the 
fymptoms common to abfcefles, together with a burning, 
fixt, heavy pain of the loins ; as alfo a tumour, and the 
urine fmall in quantity full of filaments and threads, at- 
temied with a ftrangury. The kidneys are likewife fubject 
to abfcefles, which confume their whole fubfance, except 
a bag. In this cafe there is bloody urine, or it i mixt 
with purulent matter, and looks milky, which fettles to the 
bottom, and has a ftrong fmell. Sometimes the bladder is 
corroded by it with intolerable pain. Neither is the head 
free from abfcefTes, which in infants happens behind the 
ears, when the running is ftopt with intolerable pain, a 
fever and a delirium. Sometimes an abfcefs lies hid be- 
tween the cavities of the bones of the fo-ehead, with a 
moft intenfe pain in the forehead, and about the root of 
the nofe, drawing the whole head into confent. When 
fome fpoonfuls of a yellow fetid matter drops from the 
nofe, or is drawn off by a proper errhine, the pain will 
ceafe. 

Thefe abfcefles differ greatly from uicers, for the forrrrr 
-are in the flefhy parts, and contain pure white concocled 
matter ; whereas ulcers attack the cold dry membrana- 
ceous part?, and pour out a little fetid ichor, and depraved 
ferum. The cure of internal abfcefles, in general, is 
too much out of the reach of medicine : neverthelef , they 
may be abforbed, or tranflated to parts within reach, psr-

tlcularly the legs, which has often been the cafe in thefc 
diforders of the breaft. 

ABSORBENTS. Thefe confift of fea-fhells, coral, cuttle- 
fifh-bone, burnt hartfhorn, egg - {hells, crabs -eyes and 
claws, chalk, the calx of all ftones, boles and fealed 
earths; as alfo filings of iron, all fixt falts, and Magnefia 
alba. They blunt and deftroy acids, though never fo 
corrofwe, and change them into a different fubftance. The 
fixt or alkaline falts being united to acids, become neutral falts, 
and acquire other properties ; for they then will incide thick, 
vifcid, tenacious humours, and by a gentle ftimulus either 
move the belly, or promote urine, or excite infenfible per- 
fpiration. It may likewife be obferved, that iron, coral, 
or bole leave an aftringency behind them. 

Abforbents are not good, when there is a great plenty 
of thick foul matter in the ftomach, as is often the cafe 
of burning, bilious, or hec~tic fevers. But they are very 
proper to prepare the body for evacuations, when acidities 
abound in the ftomach. If the intention is to abforb, 
aftringe, and ftrengthen at the fame time, then coral, 
oifter and egg-ihells are proper : if to reftrain a feminal 
flux, cuttle bone ; if to loofen the belly, Magnefia alba ; 
if to provoke urine, crabs-eyes ; if to promote perforation, 
burnt hartshorn ; laftly, if to diflblve coagulated blood, crabs- 
eyes dSflblved in vinegar. 

ACIDS. Among all the errors of diet, there is none 
more d^ruclive to a human body than acids ; and all 
Aliments abounding with acid juices leffen the excretions, 
thicken the blood and lymphatic fluids, caufe coagulations, 
difpofe the vifcera to obftruclions or infarctions, flop the 
ufual evacuations of blood, and confequently generate long 
and grievous diforders. When acids are taken immodera- 
tely, they hinder the generation of chyle, and confequen- 
tly deprave the blood, and deprive all the parts of their 
due nourifhment. Hence a little vinegar, given to puppies 
for two or three months, will ftunt their growth. 

Acids are exceeding hurtful to a weak ftomach, whofe 
contents readily turn four, and being retained there be- 
come frill worfe ; for mixing with the bilious juices, they 
aiTume a corroiive and virulent nature, and by corroding 
the nervous parts of the ftomach and inteftines, they will 
draw the whole nervous fyftem into confcnt, and produce 
5 the 



*Tbe FAMILY PHYSICIAN* 5 

the mod grievous fymptoms. Acid crudities in the firft 
paflages, by corrupting milk, fweet and fat things will 
turn them into a kind of a poifon, which will occa- 
fion heartburns, violent pains in the ftomach, inflations 
of the ftomach and inteftines, head-ach, and obftru&ions 
of the belly, pain in the bowels, a continual dcfire of 
going to ftool, and pale excrements ; as alfo fuch bel- 
chings as are attended with a cough and vomiting. Hence 
it appears why hypochondriac, hyfteric, and feverifli pa- 
tients are never the better for taking aliments. 

Acids often occafion grievous and tedious illnefTes, fuch 
as polypous concretions in the blood veflels, the ftone, pains 
of the joints, the hypochondriac difeafes, and the gout. 
They are very pernicious to women with child, that give 
fuck, are in child-bed, or who have their menfes deficient 
through age. 

Acids are eafily corrected by foap, oifter-fhells, crabs- 
eyes, fixed falts, and the like, which being joined with 
laxatives, balfamics, and ftrengtheners, many grievous di- 
feafes may be either cured, mitigated, or prevented. How- 
ever, when perfons are young, or of a hot conftitu- 
tion, or ufe much exercife, or who live in a hot climate, 
or in hot weather, acids will preferve health, excite the ap- 
petite, and promote digeftion. 

AFTER-PAINS. The violent pains which continue 
after the child is born, may generally be abated .^y drink- 
ing plentifully of the decoction of camomile flowers, in 
the manner of tea. If the labour has been hard, give an 
ounce and a half of frefli oil of fweet almonds in a draught 
of it hot. A dram of the yellow part of orange peel, given 
for a dofe, is likewife very good : or the following bolus j 
*' Take twenty grains of fperma ceti, five grains of volatile 
" fait of hartshorn, five drops of balfam of Peru, thirty grains 
" of Venice treacle, and make them into a bolus, with the 
" fyrup of white popies." Give it foon after delivery.

diiiant from mines and marfhes ; where the water is foft,, 
clear, light, and iniipid. Some tender, weak conititutions, 
cannot bear the northerly or eafterly winds, and therefore 
their bed-rooms {hould be towards the weft or fouth. 

In London, when the weather is d^rk, dull, and fog-

{Tble. Clofe fmail rooms art always prejudicial to health, 
b.caufe the air, in fuch places, will he rendered unfit for 
breathing by the vapours that proceed from our bodies ; and 
it is often a fatal error to draw the curtains clofe about a 
fick perfon, as well as to keep all frefli air out of the 
room, for it prevents the fweet refrefhing influences of 
the air. Befidcs, if a perfln in health cannot bear to fit

ALEXIPHARMACS. See SUDORIFICS. 

ALOETICS. Thefe are medicines wherein aloes is the 
chief ingredient, and are attended with the faculty of 
gently opening the body ; as alfo of ftrengthening the 
tromach, and_ inteftine , when they are weakened by pur- 
ges. They are pr per for perfons of a weak digeftion, when 
recovering from a difeafe, to corret and evacuate crude 
juices, and when there are acid crudities in the ftomach, 
which is the cafe of hypochondriacs. They are likewife 
proper for child-bed women, and when there is an obftruc- 
lion of the monthly courfes. 

When aioes is not properly corrected, or is given in, 
too large a dofe, it raifes commotions in the blood, pro- 
rriotes haemorrhages, or bleeding, caufes too great a flux of 
the menfes, and brings on the piles.

fluid. The nerves lie no where more bare than in the 
nofe, which accounts for the effects of fmells in fainting 
fits. In difeafes, the fpeedieft way to reftore the itrength, 
is by taking away the caufes. Befides, this is not to be 
done merely by the force of medicines which put the fpirits 
in motion, and fpur the folids j for in convulfions and 
fevers, the motions are ftrong, and yet the natural ftrength 
is languid. Whence we may conclude, that true ftrength de- 
pends upon congruous aliment, turned into laudable blood 
and juices, yielding plenty of animal fpirits, which give vi- 
gour and firmnefs to the body. 

ANODYNES are fuch medicines as eafe pain, and pro- 
cure fleep. They are chiefly of the poppy-kind, of which 
opium is the infpiflated juice ; as alfo faftron. NARCOTICS 
are anodynes, by ftupifying the fenfes ; whence they are 
not friendly to nature, but often bring on a deadly fleep, 
or throw the patient into madnefs. Thefe pernicious drugs 
are cheifly henbane, ftrammony, datura, and deadly night- 
fliade. PAREGORICS confift of foft, fulphureous, mucous 
parts, which, by their contact, relax the hard tenfe fibres, 
which are contracted by fpafms, involving and blunting the 
points of the irritating particles; and are therefore of great 
ufe in pains, painful tumours, (harp defluxion*, in the form

cafe, fmoakini; tobacco is likewife good. The decor:on3 
in wine, or infufions in brandy, of pellitory, cloves, mar- 
joram, or angelica, are good for the tongue, mouth, 
teeth, and gums ; as alfo in hardnefs of hearing, and 
noik ,n the ears. They are likewife good in a re'axa- 
tion of the uvula, lofs of voice, and palfy of the tongue, 
with the addition of a little fal ammoniac, or fpirit of 
the fame. 

APO. LEXY. When aperfon is feized with a fit of an 
apoplexy, bleed in the jugular vein as foon as poffible, and 
fcarify the hind-part of the head, or rather let him be 
cup'd in that place with fcarification. Then let him be 
carried backward and forward a-crofs the room, by two 
flrong men. If the patient is likely to come to himfelf, 
a faline clyfter* which irritates the guts, will promote it. 
" Take eight ounces of water, thirty grains of colloquin- 
" tida pills, and three drams of common fait, make them 
" into a clyfter. " Likewife rub the legs and arms 
flrongly, efpecially the bottoms of the feet, with a rough 
cloth to excite pain. Strong blifters fhould likewife be 
applied to the neck, back, and calves of the legs. Vomits 
fhould not be given, for they force the blood and humours 
into the head, and griping purges have brought on the fit. 
If the patient recover?, let him bleed, fpring and fall ; 
keep his body open with rhubarb and Epfom fait, and let 
him constantly drink tea made with balm, betony, fage, 
and the lefllr cardamom feeds. 

APPETITE, want of. This is often an attendant on 
other difeafes, and the reftoring of it depends on their 
cure. Sometimes it is a difeafe of itfelf, and then if there 
js a reaching to vomit, give twenty grains of ipecacuanha, 
to bring the foul matter off the ftomach. Then next, give 
an ounce of Epfom fait, to cleanfe the firft paffages, and to 
carry the humours downwards. After this, give thirty 
drops of the elixir of aloes, three time a day, for a week. 
To complete the cure, let the patient take half a fpoonful, 
or a fpoonful of the bitter tincture every day, an hour 
before dinner, for fome time. Mint, pepper-mint, orange- 
peel, gentian, wormwood, ginger, cinnamon, and the 
bark, are all good for the fame purpofe. "When the fio- 
jnach has been weakened by hard drinking or frequent de- 
bauches.

bauches, then give thirty drops of the fweet elixir of vi- 
triol twice a day. 

ASTHMA. This, in general, is a very laborious and diffi- 
cult breathing, with whcefmg, attended with unutterable 
anxiety, and a ftraitnefs of the breaft. A tr.olft aftbma is 
attended with a cough, which forces up phlegm, or a pi- 
tuitous matter, wherewith the lungs are ftuffed, hindering 
the free ingrefs and egrefs of the air. The dry fpafmodic 
oftbma is a convqlfive contraction of the parts deugned 
for breathing, and may be owing to various caufes, both 
within, and without the body. 

In the fit of moijl ajlbnia^ bleed firft of all, afterwards 
give the following bolus. " Take fifteen grains of fper- 
' ma ceti, ten grains of gum ammoniac, feven grains of 
" fait of hartshorn, and make them into a bolus, with 
" fyrup of fugar. " Or a fpoonful of oxymel of fquills 
may be given every hour, for three or four times. Like- 
wife bathing the feet in warm water, will often give great 
relief. Out of the fit, let the patient be purged every 
third day, with rhubarb or manna, for three times. On 
the days in which purging is omitted, give the powder of 
anifeed made into pills, with Lucatelli's balfam, in the morn- 
ing and at five in the afternoon : half a dram is a doze. 
If the fymptoms ftill continue, repeat the fame method 
over again. Inftead of the pills, the patient may take from 
three drops to ten of the anifated balfam of fulphur, or the 
following pills : ** Take three drams of gum ammoniac, 
" three drams of Caftile foap, one dram of powder pf 
" fquiiis, and make them into pills with white fugar. 
*< Make ten pills out of every dram, and then three is 
a dofe. " 

In the fit of a dry convi/tylve or fpafmodlc ajlbma, if the 
breathing is very difficult, bleeding will be neceflary, and 
then give the following potion : " Take two drams of 
" gum ammoniac, and difiolve it in four ounces of fennel 
" water, then add two ounces of Rhenifh wine, and for- 
" ty drops of liquid laudanum. Give two or three fpoon- 
*' fuls every hour, till the difficulty of breathing remits. " 
The feet muft likewife be rub'd hard, or put into warm 
water. Out of the //, if the difeafe is owing to fullnefs 
of blood in the breaft, bleed in the foot; if to the fup- 
preffion of the bleeding piles, apply leeches to the funda- 
ment ;

znent ; likewife ufe exercife and a flender diet. If .to 
the fuppreffion of the menfes, go to Bath. When there are 
iymptoms of the hypochondriac difeafe, keep the body open 
with manna, or Epfom fait, and order laxative ciylters. 
When impure matter is drove back from the fkin, or old ul- 
cers have been injudicioufiy healed, ufe medicines that promote 
a gentle f/>eat, and laxatives. When the matter of tiie gout 
has left the feet, bathing them in warm water w:ll bring 
it back. 

ASTRINGENTS contract and ftrengthen the fibres, 
thicken the fluids, leflen the diameter of the veilels, and 
ftraiten the pores ; whence they are coniblidating and con- 
glutinating. When they are given injudiciouily in he- 
morrhages and fluxes, they do a great deal of mifchief, 
and bring on flow feven>, cachexies, dropiical tumours, 
the colic, fpafmodic, and hypochondriacal diforders. They 
are belt given in fmall dofes in a fufficient quantity of 
liquid, uling exercife, if poiiible, at the fame time. Enor- 
mous vomiting, bloody unne, haemorrhages of the noie, 
ovtr-fiowing of the monthly courfes, an exce.Lve flux of 
the piles, mould never be attempted to be cured by aftrin- 
gents, before the fpafms are allaytd that occaiion them, 
diverting the humours at the fame time to ot.:er parts. 
Aitrinj!.ents are of great ufe in confumptions of the lun^s, 
the fcurvy, cachexy, and gravel, when the tone of the 
glands and bowels is weakened by a Itagnation of hu- 
mours, unlefs the veflels are obftructed, the fibres con- 
ftiinged, and the lungs are befet with tubercles. 

ATTENDANTS. Some of thefe act upon the fluids, 
and fome upon the folids : of the former fort t, ere are 
very few j t;.e principal are aqueous dilue; ts, whicji cer- 
lainly have a great efficacy in melting down and difiblving 
clammy, fi'/-y humours; as alfo fixt alkaline faits, vola- 
tile and nitrous falts ; for thefe, given in a liquid form, 
render the blood, and thick denie humours more fluid. 
Aimofi all the reft operate on the folids, by increafing 
their tone, itrength and contractile force, by rendering 
the vefiels more elaftic ; infomuch that they more ftrong- 
ly prefs the contained fluids, make their progreffions more 
quick, and the intcftine motions more lively \ infomuch

and reduced to a much lefs compafs, and confequently will 
become more fluid. This action on the folids is perfor- 
med in fome by an acrid fixed fait, as in the roots of 
cuckow-pint, white-pimpenel, afarabacca, Florentine orris, 
Solomon's-fea!, the leaves of arnica, or German leopard's 
bane, and pepper-wort ; as alfo pepper and ginger. Again, 
fome produce their efFecl: by a fubtile volatile acrid fait j 
fuch as horfe-radifh, elecampane, crefles, fcurvy-grafs, mu- 
ftard, leeks, onions and garlic : fome chiefly flimulate, as 
the neutral falts, fuch as fa! ammoniac, Epfom fait, vitriclat- 
ed tartar, and diuretic fait. Others a6t by an acrid fait, 
imbuted with plenty of fulphureous particles, as gum am- 
moniac, fagapenurn, opoponax, the wood of guaiac, and its 
rofln. Laftly, fome operate by a fubtile, penetrating, meta- 
lic fait, as Mercurius dulc.s, and sthiops mineral. 

Some of thefe are moft proper to diflblve and incide 
thick Immours in the ftomach and firft pafiages, fuch as 
the root of cuckow-pint, pepper, ginger, fal ammoniac, 
vitriolated tartar, fak of wormwood, and dulcified fpirit 
of fait. If the humours are to be carried downwards, at 
the fame time, nothing is better than Epfom fait. When 
fizy humours are to be diffolved, in diforders of the breaft, 
then make ufe of elecampane, Florentine crris, maiden- 
hair, gum ammoniac, myrrh, benjamin, flowers of brim- 
flone, balfam of Tolu and Peru, diuretic fait, and oxymel 
of fquills. When the blood is foul and tainted with fcor- 
butic humours, then give horfe-radifh, fcurvy-grafs, wa- 
ter crefies, brooklime, buck beans, the lefier centaury, mu- 
ftard feed, gum ammoniac, myrrh, oil of tartar per de'i- 
quium, fpirit of fal ammoniac, and fait of wormwood, with 
the juice of oranges. When the blood is congrumated in 
any part by bruifes or falls, then direct the root of Sol- 
mon's feal, the leaves of chervil, diftilled vinegar, with crabs 
eyes, or ftibiated nitre. When the lympha is thickned by 
the venereal difeafe, or otherwife, prefcribe the wood of 
guaiac in decoclion, Mercurius dulcis-, or sethiops mineral. 

BATHS. Under this title I mall only take notice of 
domeftic baths, which are made in bathing tubs fitted for 
that purpofe. The water made ufe of muft be foft and light, 
latherino; readily with foap. If this is not to be had, it 
muft foftned by the addition of foap, or by mixing it 
with milk, or by boiling wheat bran in it. Likewife it may 
be corrected by camomile flower, or the leaves, flowers or 

roots

Foots of white lilies, or laflly the leaves of mallows or 
marm-mallows. The water (hou'd be made pretty warm, 
but not too hot, for then it will have bad effe&s. A bath 
thus made vs ufeful to promote an eafy delivery, efpecially 
if it be the firll: child, and the woman is not young and 
of a dry conftitution ; but it muft be ufed principally in the 
Jaft months. Likewife in the dorfal confumption of infants, 
and in the rickets ; becaufe they open the obftru&ed and 
conducted yeflels, render the nutritious juice more fluid, and 
more eafy to be diftributed all over the body. But the 
cold bath is the beft in this laft cafe< if the child is imme- 
diately put between blankets, to fvveat after it. 

Thefe fort of baths are good in difeafes of th head, in me- 
lancholy, in diforders of the mind, attended with dreadful 
dreams, the head-ach, giddinefs of the head, tooth-ach, and 
other pains of the nervous parts ; particularly the pains of 
the ftomach, the colic, and a fit of the gravel. They are fo 
remarkable for eafing pains arifing from fpaflic ftrictures, 
that though iome are quite at eafe while they fit in the bath, 
they will return as foon as they are out of it. They like- 
wife promote the circulation of the blood and humours, and 
forward perfpiration through the flctn ; for if the patient re- 
moves from the bath into a warm bed, and his body is rubbed 
with dry cloths, he will fall into a profufe fweat. 

BELLY- ACH DRY. This is a kind of colic, which fre- 
quently degenerates into a palfy, and is called by fome a nervous 
or convulfive colic. It is known by an intolerable piercing pain 
fometimes in one part, fometimes in feveral parts of the inteftines 
or guts, which fecms to draw them all up together in a heap. 
The patient is kept continually upon the rack for eight, ten, 
or fourteen days, with an obftinate coftivenefs. The whole 
intention of cure, is to open the body, for which purpofe 
fome give twenty grains of the cathartic extract, with a 
grain of opium ; after which two fpoonfuls every hour of 
the infufion of fenna, mixt with a fourth part of tincture of 
fenna. But the following bolus is better : " Take a dram 
4 of vitriolated tartar, ten grains of fait of tartar, and a drop 
" of eflential oil of nutmegs ; make them into a bolus, with 
" a fufficient quantity of lenitive electuary. " This muft be 
repeated every fourth hour, till it begins to work. Some 
ufe emollient fomentations to the belly, or half baths made 
with camomile flowers and marfh mallows. When the cure

is advanced, rhubarb, or the tindtura facra will keep the 
body open. 

BITE of a MAD Doo. Dr. Mead's medicine for this is 
as follows : " Take four drams of afli-coloured ground li- 
" ver-wort, and two drams of black pepper; make them 
*' into a powder." Divide this in into four dofes, and give 
one in warm milk for four mornings fuccefiively. After 
this the patient muft go into a cold bath, river, or pond, 
for half a minute, with his head above water. This is to 
be repeated early in the morning before breakfaft, for thirty 
days together. The Eaft-India medicine, is twenty four 
grains of native and factitious cinnabar, and fixteen grains 
of mufk. If the patient has any fymptoms attending this 
difeafe, he muft take the fame quantity at the end of three 
hours, otherwife not till the end of thirty days. Mufk is 
certainly an excellent medicine againft this difafter alone: 
with cinnabar it has been given every three hours, after bleed- 
ing largely, with opium in large dofes, that is two grains, 
to procure fleep, and a galbanum plafter, with half an ounce 
of pure opium, was laid to the throat and neck. This 
was done after the patient was affected with the dread of 
water. When {he was a little better, (he took them every 
fix hours, with one grain of opium. On ti.e fecond day 
ihe loft twenty ounces of blood, and twelve on the third; 
on which the plafter was renew'd with only two drams 
of opium, and only one opium pill at night. Being coftive 
Ihe had three clyfters with antimonial wine. The fecond 
wrought well. In a week's time {he was pretty well ; but 
being terrified, re'apfed, and was quite cured with the fol- 
lowing powder, her diforder being then hyfterical : " Take 
" twelve grains of affa foetida, ten grains of mufk, and fix 
*' grains of camphire ; make a powder. " This may be 
made into a bolus with fyrup of fugar. This little extract 
of the cafe is not laid down as an example, for then I 
(hould have been more particular ; and thefe medicines muft 
be regulated by the urgency of the fymptoms; for if two 
dofes of opium procure fleep, it would be madnefs to give 
a third, till the effe&s of the former were almoft over. 
So probably many cafes will not require fo frequent a repe- 
tition of the powder, nor may the coftivenefs require fre 
quent clyfters. Nothing but fo dreadful a cafe could have 
juftified fo free a ufe of the opium. However, this roe-

thod affords excellent hints for the management of this dif- 
eafe. I fhould have obferved fhe took the Jaft bolus twice 
the firft day, and then once for two or three days more, 
with draughts proper to cure the ficknefs of the ftomach. 

BLEEDING at the NOSE. Tnis often happens when the 
patient is afflicted with difeafes, and fometimes when he 
is otherwife in health. I fhall only fpeak of the latter in 
this place. It differs much as to quantity, for fome lofe only 
a few drops, fome feveral ounces, and fome five or fix 
pounds ; and it is very apt to return. It conduces to health, 
when the patient is full of blood and humours. Sometimes 
it cures a giddinefs and heavy pains in the head ; as alfo 
a phrenfy, and even the falling ficknefs, When the bleed- 
ing is periodical, and not too large, it fhould not be 
ftopt, nor when there is a fuppreffion of the menfes in 
women, or the lochia in child-bed, or the bleeding piles 
in men, if they are ufed to return at ftated feafons When 
this bleeding has been injudicioufly ftopt, it has produced 
giddinefs, or fwimming in the head, noife in the ears, hard- 
nefs of hearing, the apoplexy, convulfions, the falling fick- 
nefs, and blindnefs. When this bleeding happens to per- 
fons that are young, full of blood, in the fpring of the 
year, or after hard drinking, the commotion of the blood 
may be allayed with nitre thus : 4< Take half an ounce of 
" purified nitre or fa!t-petre, two ounces of loaf fugar, 
" twenty grains of cochineal, and two pints and an 
" half of fpring-water. Boil them to a quart ; let it fettle, 
" and pour off the clear liquor. " Three ounces of this 
may be taken thrice a day : or the patient may take 
five or fix fpoonfuls of the tincture of roies, and repeat it 
as occafion requires. When the bleeding is very violent, 
ten drops of liquid laudanum may be added to each dofe. 
By way of revulfion, bleed the patient in the foot, and 
put his feet in cold water. Outwardly dip a linen cloth 
in the decoclion above mentioned, fqueeze it out gently, 
and lay it to the back parts and fides of the neck. Like- 
wife dip lint in the blue vitriolic water, and put it up 
the noftril. If thefe fail, powder equal parts of roch alum, 
and drazon's blood : the dofe is half a dram every hour. 
BLISTERS. The applying of blifters properly, asiainft any 
difeafe, is very ufeful, and may be fo managed as to cure 
various maladies. But when laid on out of feafon, or in 
4. fome 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. i 

fome ftages of a diftemper, will do a great deal of hurt : 
therefore it is of the highel't confequence to know when 
they are fuitable, and when nor. 

In CHROMIC DISEASES they will relieve obftinate head- 
achs, rhetimatifms of the head, when the blood veflels of 
the whites of the eyes are turgid with blood attended with 
a moift rheum, or when the rednefs of them proceeds from 
the king's evil ; as alfo when the eye-lids are glued to- 
gether in the night by a thick humour. They are likewife 
good in obflinate defluxions on the eyes and ears, in a 
tedious running of the nofe, in the tooth -ach from a fe- 
rous rheum, in fleepy diforders, in little ulcers of the head 
of a long ftanding, or when the humour of a fcald head 
is driven inwardly. Moreover, they are ufeful in a palfy 
of the tongue, in hardnefs of hearing, and in a noife of 
the ears, from a cold caufv.-, and when breaking out, or 
fpots on the (kin have ftruck in, and are to be recalled. 
The fciatica, or hip- gout will yield to bleeding, and laying 
a blifter on the part affe&ed. 

In ACUTE DISEASES they are likewife of great ufe y . 
particularly in the fmall pox, when the puftules lie buri- 
ed in the fkin for two or three days, and when they ap- 
pear like watry bladders. In the fit of an apoplexy, in- 
low nervous fevers, in all fevers when there is a defect of 
vital heat, and the pulfe is weak and languid ; for this 
reafon they ought to be applied at the latter end of 
putrid fevers, when the fpirits and pulfe fink, which is a 
fign that nature wants a fpur, or when this difeafe brings 
on a phrenfy, and bleeding is dangerous becaufe the pa- 
tient is very low. In this laft cafe the defect may be fup- 
plied by apply in I leeches to the temples, and a bliner to 
the head and other parts of the body. But if the pulfe 
is funk, and the patient appears ftupid or infenfible, blitters 
and leeches muft be omitted, an! ftimulatin?; poultices or 
finapifms muft be laid to the foals of the feet. In violent 
inflammations of the eyes, blifters muft be laid behind the. 
ears, muft lie on two or three days, and the fores muft 
' be kept running. In a quinfy, a large and ftrong blifter 
muft be laid to the fore part of the neck. In a pleurify, 
alter the firft bleeding, it mu 1 be applied upon the 
pained fide. In an inflammation of the lungs, after the 
firft bleeding it muft be laid to the back, and to one cr both 

fifes.

des. In a fpurious peripneumony, Jikewife, bliftering is of 
great fervice. In the inflammation of the liver, ftomach* 
or inteftines, in the iliac paffion, and a fact pain of the 
bowels, a large blifter fhould be laid over the part affected; 
BLISTERS ftiould never be applied in the beginning of 
common fevers, if the pulfe is ftrong, and the difeafe is 
gaining ftrength; nor yet to the hectic, to women with 
child, to the lean, nor to thofe who have ftrong tenfe fi- 
bres. Blifters are likewife very improper in a fit of the 
gravel, in the ftone of the kidneys or bladder, when the pa- 
tient is full of blood, without preceding evacuations, as alfo 
in profufe bleedings of any kind. The reafon of all which 
may be readily conceived, when we confider that blifters 
act by ftimulating the folids, attenuating the fluids, by re- 
vulfion, by bringing out the morbific matter, and that they 
particularly affect the urinary paflages, often taufing a 
flrangury, if not prevented in time. They fhould never be 
laid to the thighs or legs, when they are oedematous or 
diftended with water, left they produce a gangrene. Ajlran- 
gury may be prevented by foft diluting liquors, particularly 
by a folution of gum arabic in water. 

BLOOD-LETTING. It is of very great confequence to 
know when to bleed, and when not : for if the patient has too 
little blood or is weak, or has a low weak languid pulfe, 
bleeding is dangerous. But fometimes a lofs of ftrength or 
a low pulfe may be owing to too much blood, and then 
the pulfe will rife as (bon as the blood begins to flow. 
Bleeding is generally neceffary in the beginning of acute, 
continual, or inflammatory fevers, when the pulfe is ftrong 
or hard ; in particular kinds of epidemic fevers it is doubt- 
ful, and the height of the pulfe is moft commonly the rule. 
Bleeding is dangerous in the fit of an ague, in hyfteric 
fits, and in fits of the falling ficknefs j in a fuppreflion of 
the menfes, it will be beft to bleed in the foot. In difea- 
fes of the head, neck, or eyes, it will be propereft in the 
jugular vein, or under the tongue. When the patient is 
full of blood and ftrong, he may loofe twelve ounces at 
once. But it muft be fparing in exceflive bleedings of any 
kind, and in fpitting of blood. In general it ferves for three 
purpofes ; evacuation, revulfion, and derivation. 

BLOODY-FLUX. This begins with fhivering and (baking, 
Which is fucceeded with heat, griping of the guts, flimy ftools,

and violent pain. There is a preffing down, or feeming de- 
fcent of all the bowels at every (tool. In procefs of time, the 
ftools are mixt with blood, and afterwards pure b.ood only comes 
away, which is followed by an incurable gangrene. When 
this is taken in time, the patient muft firft be blooded, and 
afterward take a vomit with twenty grains of ipecacuanha, 
drinking a large quantity of warm water after it. This muft be 
fometimes repeated : but fome think it better to give only five 
grains at a time, and to repeat it twice or thrice the fame day, 
till a vomiting or purging comes on, or the ipecacuanha will be 
rendered more purgative, with a grain or two of emetic tartar. 
The next day give two fcruples or a dram of good rhubarb : this 
purge muft be repeated the next day or the following. No opi- 
ates muft be given till after the patient has been vomited and pur- 
ged j then " Take feven ounces of fmall cinnamon water> 
" one ounce of ftrortg cinnamon water j two drams of the com- 
" pound powder of bole with opium ; mix them. " Give a 
fpoonful or two of this on the days rhubarb is omitted ; and 
the fame night at bed- time. But if the cafe is very bad, omiting 
all other medicines, give feven grains of the cerated glafs of 
antimony every other day,, but let the patient drink nothing 
after it, unlefs he hisfick and difpofed to vomit, and then allow 
him warm water, as in other vomits. Sometimes one dofe will 
cure, and at other times, feveral are required. The patient 
may take water gruel, chicken broth, arid a little harts-horn jelly 
now and then. 

BLOODY URINE, is commonly called piffing of blood,which 
comes away either with or without urine^ when the vefTels of 
the kidneys or bladder are enlarged or broken. When pure 
blood comes away fuddenly without pain, it proceeds from the 
kidneys, or when it is coffee coloured, for then it precedes a fit of 
the gravel. When there is a heat and pain in the pube<, at the 
fame time that the blood is of a dark colour, it comes from the 
bladder. Bloody urine may be caufed by a ftoppage of the bleed- 
ing piles by violent "motions of the body, efpecially riding j 

by ftones wounding the kidneys, ureters or bladder, from erofions 
and ulcers of the bladder, from {harp diuretics, efpecially can- 
tharides. 

When the patient is full of blood, or any ufual evacuation 
of blood has been fupprefled, it will be neceffary to breed in the 
arm, and to take nitre, as directed in the bleeding of the nofe. 
The body muft be kept open wirh rhubarb and cream of tartar 

B If

If the diforder does not ceafe, let the patient drink three half 
pints of lime water in a day. If the bleeding is exceflive, take 
the powder mentioned in the bleeding of the nofe. Otherwife, 
aftringents, that lock the blood up in the veflels, fhould be for- 
borne. When there is purulent matter mixt with the blood, 
there is an ulcer in the kidneys or bladder, and then the beft 
remedy is tar water. 

BOILS ; thefe are fo well known, they need no defcription. 
Some, when they begin to appear, ufe applications to drive them 
back, which is a very dangerous practice. The beft way is to 
draw them to a head, and then open them. This may be done 
withdiacyhlon with the gums, or the following poultice: "Take 
" four ounces of figs, two ounces of yellow bafilicon, and half 
" an ounce of drained galbanum ; beat the figs to a pulp 
" with a little wine or ftrong beer ; then add the bafilicon and 
" gafbanum melted together, and mix them well." When the 
boil is quite ripe, which may be known by its yellow head, 
it may be opened with a lancet or a pair of fciflars, and when 
all the matter is difcharged, then it may be cover'd with dry 
lint, and a plafter over that to keep it on; by which means it will 
foon heal. When infants are troubled with boils, the nurfe 
fhould be purged, and the infant take a few grains of the com- 
pound powder of crab's claws, three times a day. 

BRUISES. A bruife or contufion may be known by the eye; 
for firft it will be red or black, then livid, yellow, green, 
and at laft black again ; unlefs it be flight, for then it recovers 
its natural colour without any application. When you 
have reafon to fufpecl a bruife, and it is not difcoverable 
by the eye, you may feel about the place, and if you feel an un- 
ufual foftnefs, or a fluctuation of extravafated blood, you 
may be fure that is the part affected : as alfo, when there is 
a pain and ftiffhefs. If the inward parts are bruifed, you may 
know which it is by one or other of the functions being hurt. 

When the bruile is flight, as that of a child's fore-head 
by a fall, it may be relieved with fpirit of wine, or campho- 
rated fpirit of wine, or hungary water; or by dipping a bit 
of thick brown paper in very cold water, and laying it on 
the fwelling. If the bruife is large, you may apply lime- 
water mht with camphorated fpirit of wine; or a fpunge 
dipt in frefh urine, in which Venice foap has been diffolved, 
or opodeldoc made warm. If the bruifed part tends to a 
gangrene, a furgeon muft be fent for immediately to fcarify

the part, and fet the ftagnating fluids at liberty : after which 
it muft be fomented with the common fomentation of the 
London difpenfatory, rubbing the tumor with hot cloths 
before it is fomented. Or you may take three ounces of pow- 
der of briony root, and as much Venice treacle, and bring it to 
the confidence of poultice with fea-water, fait water, or com- 
mon water. 

When the bruife is confiderable, internal remedies fhould 
never be neglected ; fuch as the decoction of betony, male 
fpeedwel, rofemary, or fage, drank plentifully. When the 
bruife is internal, you may give a pint a day of the following 
decoction ; " Take the leaves of ground ivy and plantane, 
half an ounce of each j of fpring water three pints j boil it 
to a quart, and fweeten it with an ounce of fine fugar." Or 
give thirty or forty drops of the traumatic balfam, or Friar's 
balfam, feveral times a day. Or you may advife a dram of 
fperma ceti, in a draught of the above decoction. The pa- 
tient muft eat no flefh, nor drink ftrong liquors, but live 
wholly upon broths and fpoon-meat. 

When the fluids in the bruife are difperfed or evacuated, 
the fore may be cured as an ulcer ; which fee. 

BURNS, Alum diflblved in water and applied, or rectified 
fpirit of wine, will prevent the bliftering of a flight burn. 
Or hold the part before the fire ; or apply raw onions, foap 
and oil beaten together for a poultice. When a burn is bli- 
fiered, it is not to be cut, but muft be treated with emollients ; 
or foap and oil, or with the faturnine ointment. When the 
burn is fo deep as to caufe a gangrene, it muft be fcarified 
and treated with emollients ; as alfo warm fomentations and 
poultices. When the efchar is caft off, it muft be cured as 
a wound or ulcer. In all confiderable burns, the patient muft 
bleed, take cooling purges, fuch as the lenitive eledluary, or 
Epfom fait ; and drink plentifully of thin liquors. 

BURNING FEVER. See FEVER BU.<NINO. 

CACHEXY, or ill habit of body. In this the fkin is pale, 
white, yellow, green, tawny or livid, with a heavinefs, a 
fweliing under the eyes, and in oth'er tender parts. Thofe 
moft diftant from the heart are bloated, with a palpitation of 
the heart, which increafes on the leaft motion. The urine is 
crude and thin, with watery fweats, and the body is at laft re- 
duced to a fkeleton, or the patient falls into a dropfy. The 
fiate of the blood and humours muft be made thin with AU-

cant or Caftile foap, of which twenty grains may be taken 
every three hours in the day time, made up into pills. Or 
difiblve an ounce of fait of wormwood in a quart of water, 
fweetening it with double refined fugar, and give half a gill glafs- 
ful every third hour. Continue either of thefe for a week, and 
then take half a dram of the ecphraHc pills night and morn- 
ing, drinking at the fame time the decoiHon of wormwood, 
purl, or bitter wine. Or inftead of the pills, the elixir of 
aloes, formerly called Elixir Pmprietati^ may be taken three 
times a day j the dofe is from twenty drops to fixty. If this 
difea r e degenerates into a dropfy, it muft be cured as fuch. 

CANCER in the breaft. This at firft is a tumour of the fize 
of a pea, with little or no pain ; fometimes it is of the fize of 
a hazle nut, but does not difcolour the fkin, and may continue 
in that ftate for feveral years. When this fmall tumour be- 
comes fuddenly round and livid with an unequal furface, there 
is generally an intenfe (hooting pain. At length it breaks 
through the fkin, and fheds a fordid, vifcid, bloody, famous 
or ichorous matter, with an infupportable ftench. While the 
cancer is fmall and not very painful, the beft way will be to 
ufe a regular diet, and to defend it from external injuries. 
When it is very painful, a thin plate of lead may be laid over 
over it fmeared with quickfilver. Let her conftant drink be 
a decoftion of Lignum Vita^ made with four ounces of the 
rafpings, and three quarts of water boiled to two quarts. She 
may be purged now and then with half a dram of rhubarb 
mixt with five grains of calomel, and an ounce of diacodium, 
or twenty drops of liquid laudanum, may be given to procure 
fleep ; when this fails, thirty drops and upwards. When the 
cancer is broke, the moft certain way is to have it taken off 
before it eats too deep. 

CHILBLAINS. See KIBES. 

COLIC bilious. This colic is known by the hoarfenefs 
of the voice, a violent pain in the ftomaeh, a continual loath- 
ing of victuals, a burning acute continual pain about the 
region of the navel, which either feems to gird in the belly, 
or to bore it through j a vomiting up of green matter or gal> 
a bitterifh tafte in the mouth, a feverim heat, intenfe thirft, 
reftleflhefs, hiccupping, with little urine and high coloured. 
When there is an obftinate coftivenefs, it foon turns to the 
iliac paffion. The patient muft firft be bled freely, and then 
give the following bolus : " Take forty grains of vitriolated 

" tartar* 



FAMILY PH vsi c i AN. 2i 

* e tartar, ten grains of fait of tartar, a drop of efTential oil of 
" nutmegs, and make them into a bolus with lenitive eleo 
" tuary." This mud be given every fourth hour till it purges, 
which three dofes.will generally do. Likewife, a warm bath 
made with an emollient decodion is of the greateft fervice 
in this difeafe, becaufe it relaxes the ftriclure of the guts. 

COLIC from a Jlone in the will-bladder. When there is a 
ftone, or ftones in the gall-blacratr, which prevents the gall 
from running into the guts, by plugging up the paflage; then 
there is a conftant heavy fixed pain on the right fide about the 
region of the liver, which fometimes reaches to the pit of the 
ftomach. This pain is fometimes fo exafperated, that the 
gripes and torture affecl: all the inward parts of the belly. Add 
to thefe, a want of appetite, a reaching to vomit, a pain in 
the ftomach, anxiety about the heart, and coftivenefs. This 
is fucceeded by a jaundice, and in length of time a dropfy. 
In the fit, it will be proper to bleed in the arm ; then give the 
following potion : " Take two ounces of manna, an ounce 
" and half of oil of fweet almonds, a dram and half of cream 
" of tartar, twelve drains of purified nitre ; mix them." Let 
the patient take it by fpoonfuls, at proper diftances of time in 
the morning j or, the patient may take oil of fweet almonds 
alone j or a dram of fperma ceti, diflblved in broth, or fyrup 
of marfh mallows, or whatever elfe is foft, oily, and emollient. 
Out of the fit, the beft remedies are, foap, quickfilver, and 
fait water. Half a dram of Alicant foap may be taken fix 
times a day, made into pills. Half an ounce of quickfilver 
may be rub'd in a glafs mortar, with half an ounce of brown 
fugar candy, and fixteen drops of eflential oil of juniper ber- 
ries, till it difappears ; twenty grains of this may be given at 
night, mixt with twelve grains of fperma ccti, and twenty 
of conferve of mallow flowers, and be repeated every other 
night, feveral times. The patient may likewife be purged, 
now and then, with an ounce of Epfom fait, omitting the 
other things on the fame day. Or half a pint of fea water 
may be given early every morning, for fome time, after the 
foap and quickfilver have been left off. 

COLIC Convulfive. See BELLY-ACH DRY. 

COLIC flatulent^ or COLIC ftom wind. This is an acute 
Ipain in the fmall guts, with a puffing up and fuelling of the 
! belly, which can hardly bear to be touched. The ftomach is 
diftended with wind, the breathing becomes difficult, and the 
body is coftive. At length, the patient is troubled with an 

B 3 in. 



2 Z The FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

ineffectual reaching to vomit, and violent pains in the fto- 
mach. The pain may be either in the right or left fide, as 
well as beneath the ftomach. When there is wind and excre- 
ments pent up in the flexure of the colon, which is often the 
cafe, give the following clyfter : " Take half an ounce of 
" foft foap, and diflolve it in eight ounces of warm water, for 
*' a clyfter." Inwardly direct the following mixture :" Take 
" a gill of fennel-water, a gill of fimple orange* flower- water, 
" a gill of compound juniper- water, a dram and half of dulci- 
" fied fpirit of nitre, and an ounce of the fyrup ot orange peel ; 
*.' mix them." Give a fpoonful of this mixture every hour till 
the pain abates, and then every two hours. The body may be 
kept open, with manna or rhubarb, or a dram of vitriolated 
tartar. Camomile flowers may be frequently ufed like tea. 

COLIC hyfteric, is a fymptom of thehyfteric paflion. It is 
a very violent pain about the pit of the ftomach, attended with 
a vomiting of greenifh matter, and a great finking of the fyi- 
rits. It may continue a day or two, and will return when the 
mind isdifturbed. To cure it, the ftomach fliould be cleanfed 
by drinking a gallon of poiTct drink, and throwing it up again. 
Then give twenty-five drops of liquid laudanum in an ounce 
of ftrong cinnamon-water, which is to be repeated at due in- 
tervals, till the fymptoms difappear. When it returns by fits, 
the pstient may take twenty drops of Peruvian balfam thrice a 
day, in a fpoonful of the fineft fugar ; or a dram night and 
morning of the powder of zedoary, made into a bolus with 
the fyrup of orange-pee!. 

COLIC, from fumes of lead. This difeafe is called in 
Scotland, the MILL-REEK, and is common to all the workers 
in lead, fuch as miners, plumbers, makers of white-lead 4 and 
grinders of colours. At firft, there is uneafmefs and weight 
about the ftomach, efpecially about the pit of it > afterwards 
<tne" e is an intolerable pa,in in the guts like the colic, with 
great coftivenefs. The fpittle is fweet, and inclinable to be 
a little i;luifb i the pulfe a little low ; the fkin all over cold, 
and a clan^m/ fweat frequently breaks out; the legs grow 
feeble with a tingling numbnefs ; the whole body is weak, 
lazv, and unspt for motion. They lofe their appetite, and 
want digefticn, Jf the patient fall into a loofcnefs in this 
ftao-e, it carries off the difeafe, unlefs it continues too long, 
and the patient drinks drams on an empty ftomach ; then 
couws on a fixt pain in the ftomach and guts, efpecially the 
lower part of the klly, extending from one hip to the other,

The FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 23 

with a fenfe of gnawing. The pulfe becomes quick, and the 
(kin warm, with a giddinefs and a violent pain in the head, fuc- 
ceeded by infenfibility and talking idly. The hands and feet 
tremble and are convulfed. The pulfe intermits every third 
or fourth ftroke, and they die fleepy, or in an apoplexy. 

The cure muft be attempted with a double dofe of a vomit; 
that is, two ounces of emetic wine, or eight grains of emetic 
tartar, drinking warm water plentifully while it works. If it 
works upwards and downwards, the patient is in a fair way 
of recovery. Then give twenty grains of ipecacuanha, 
with two grains of tartar emetic, and that will compleat the 
cure. If the double dofe does not work at all, another ftronger 
muft be given foon after. If it does not purge as well as vomit, 
give forty grains of tartar, with twesty grains of calomel. The 
vomits and purges muft be repeated at proper intervals, till the 
uneafmefs of the ftomach and guts is <juite gone. When blood 
or matter is mixt with the ftools, then omit the vomits, till the 
guts are cured. Then, " Take fpring water, eight ounces ; 
*' lenitive eledlary, an ounce and half; Ljcatelli's balfam tiif- 
*' folved in the yolk of an egg, half an ounce; mix them 
* c for a clyfter." This being repeated at proper intervals with 
(oft food, will take aw^y this appearance. When the belly 
is much fwelled, emollient fomentations muft be applied to 
the part. Fat broth taken in a morning, is the beji preservative 
againji this difeafe. Likewife in the cure^ oil of fweet almonds 
taken plentifully by the mouth^ and oily clv/iers^ are of fmgular 
fervice. When this difeafe brings on a palfy of the arms, it 
will be neceflary that the patient Ihould be bathed in foft fweet 
water, and the back-bone mould be anointed with an ointment 
made with hog's lard, exprefled oil of nutmegs, oil of rofe- 
mary, and faffron. 

CONSUMPTION. This is an ulcer of the lungs, with 
a wafting away, a cough, a fpitting of purulent matter, which 
is fometimes bloody, a heflic fever, and a difficulty of breath- 
ing. It is fometimes preceded with a fpitting of blood ; or 
arifes from a congeftion, or fuppuration of blood in the lungs. 
When a confumption is beginning, it is often cured j but 
when it is in its laft ftage, never. 

Then the intentions of cure are to cleanfe and heal the ulcer, 
to allay the cough, to take off the fever, and to preferve the 
ftrength. In the beginning of a confumption, when the lungs 
are fluffed with a grofs phlegm, and there is a continual cough, 
efpecially in the night, take from fix to ten ounces of blood 

B 4 from 



14 bc FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

from the arm, efpecially if the patient is full of blood, or ac- 
cuftomed to bleeding. This muft be repeated twice or thrice at 
proper intervals, particularly when there is a flux of ferum, 
and a copious expectoration of phlegm. If there is a naufea or 
inclination to vomit, give an ounce .and half of oxymel of 
fquills in a draught of poffet-drink ; this may be repeated three 
or four times, every third or fourth day, with a compofmg 
draught at night, or fix grains of ftorax pills. Then give 
manna to carry the humours downwards, and the fame piUs at 
night. While the cough continues moift, give no oily medi- 
cines, but medicines that gently promote a fweat, manna, 
rhubarb, and apply a blifter between the moulders, not for- 
getting the compofmg things at night : or inftead of fweating, 
boil half an ounce of the bark, and half an ounce of lignum 
vitae, in three pints of water, to two, and give fix fpoonfuls 
every four hours, I have known thirty drops of Friar's balfam, 
taken every four hours, cure the beginning of a confumption. 
When the lungs are cbjlrutted^ and the throat and mouth are dry, 
then it will be proper to fup often fome foft liquor, and to 
draw in fleams from the fame. Likewife, " Take two drams 
'* of fpermaceti, forty drops of balfam of Peru, unite them to- 
" gether with part of the yolk of an egg, and then add two 
" ounces of fyrup of marfh-mallows." Take a tea-fpoonful of 
this often, letting it go gently down the throat. When the 
difeafe is ccnftrm'd^ an iffue on the fide moft affected, will be 
of great ufe; as alfo the following pills: " Take three drams 
<c of the powder of hog-lice, one dram of fine gum ammoniac, 
** one dram of the flowers of benjamin, ten grains of the extract 
cc of faffron, and as much balfam of Peru ; make them into pills 
<c with anifated balfam of fulphur." The dofe is twenty grains 
thrice a day. They are of excellent ufe in all flow confump- 
tions, joined to the fcurvy or king's evil, before the tubercles 
of the lung? inflame and putrify. The good effects of riding 
are generally known, ac alfo of affes milk. Half an ounce 
of conferve of rofes eaten at a time, and often, has cured 
very dangerous confumptions. Some patients have taken 
half a pound a day with fuccefi. Others have almoft lived 
vpon it. 

CONVULSIONS. The cure of thefe muft be begun 
with bleeding, if the patient is full of blood, or the pulfe 
great, but not till the fit is over, and may be repeated occafi- 

Tta 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 25 

The patient fhould remove into dry ferene air, and ufe con- 
ftant exercife. The aliment fhould be eafy of digeftion, and 
all drams fhould be forborne. The beft drink is whey. Warm 
baths for the feet, fhould be made with foft water, wheat bran, 
and camomile flowers. They fhould be ufed at bed time, and 
the patient fhould fweat after them. If the patient is coftive, 
his body fhould be kept open with manna and oily clyfters j 
and at the full and change of the moon, give an ounce of man- 
na with three grains of tartar emetic, to cleanfe the ftomach 
and guts. If they happen about fifteen, the diet fhould be foft 
and nourifhing ; fuch as whey, milk, hartfliorn jellies, and 
chocolate. He fhouid likewife ufe baths of foft water with 
milk. 

When convulfions proceed from worms, no fharp medicines 
(hould be ufed; but clyfters made of milk, fugar, and oil. 
Liniments which purge fhould be laid to the navel ; or make 
a plafter with two drams of aloes, eight drops of the efiential 
oil of wormwood, and a fufficient quantity of ox-gall, and 
lay it on the fame part. Likewife, wormfeed may be taken 
inwardly, from a fcruple to a dram. Or you may firft give a 
few fpoonfuls of oil of fweet almonds, and then from fix 
grains to thirty of mercurius dulcis, made into a bolus with 
conferve of rofes. If from the fuppreffion of womens monthly 
evacuation, all hot medicines are hurtful, but bleeding and Bath 
waters will be proper. Asalfothe tincture of caftor; the dofe 
is forty drops, thrice a day. Or, " Take five grains of cam- 
" phi re, four of mufk, and three of ana foetida : make them 
*' into a bolus with conferve of mallow-flowers, and repeat it 
" three times a day." When a ftoppage of the bleeding piles is 
the caufe, ufe the fame remedies, and apply leeches to the fun- 
dament. When the fweating of the feet is ftopt, or the mat- 
ter of difeafes of the fkin is driven in, " Take three drams of 
" wild valerian root, two drams of diaphoretic antimony, 
<c twenty grains of cinnabar; nitre, faffron, and caftor, 
* ( alfo twenty grains each ; make them into a powder." 
The dofe is a fcruple, three or four times a day. The patient 
fhould drink whey for fome weeks, and take now and then a 
dofe of manna with cream of tartar j that is, an ounce of the 
nrft, with two drams of the laft. 

CORDIALS. See ANALEPTICS. 

CORNS. Thefe are hard callous tubercles, infenfible of 
themfelves, but by prefling and bruifmg the adjacent fibres, 
they often become very painful, particularly when they hurt 

the 



z6 The FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

the fibres of the tendons, or the periofleum^ that is the mem- 
brane that immediately covers the bone. When the blood- 
veflels are compreft by corns, the circulation through them 
will be ftopt, whence arifes rednefs, and fometime an inflam- 
mation. If one of thefe fine veflels burft, a drop or two of 
blood will be extravafated, and then it will corrupt and caufe 
the corn to turn blackifh, which forbodes an ulcer. 

Sometimes corns are more painful in the evening, and a- 
gainft change of weather ; becaufe, at thofe times, the nervous 
fibres are more ftretch'd by a fulnefs of the veflels, caufed by a 
diminifhed perfpiration, which is always lefs in the cool of the 
evening, than in the day time; as alfo when the air is moifr, 
the weight of the atmofphere is grown lefs, and the air be- 
comes lefs elaftic, which is always the cafe before rain. 

When the root of the corn penetrates to the tendons, or the 
furfe/lfUm, and ftrongly compreiTes them, or when they have 
received fome blow, or are cut 10 the quick, it has often bad 
confequences, fuch as an inflammation, an abfcefs, a gangrene, 
or convulfions. When corns are fuperficial, and only lodged 
in t u e fkin, they are eafily cured. Thefe need only be foften- 
ed in warm water, and cut as near the root as poffible ; after 
which, a plafter muft be applied, confifting of equal parts of the 
plafter of the mucilages, and that of ammoniac with mercury; or 
a fmall bit of the laft alone will do of itfelf. Some ufe green 
wax, or a thin bit of lead rub'd over with quickfilvcr, or even 
fimple diachylon alone. But, above all, care muft be taken that 
the corn is not pre's'd by the fhoe, or in any other manner. 

Some have the art of drawing out a fuperficial corn, ro-.t and 
all. But if it adheres to a tendon, or to the ferlojliiim^ great care 
muft be taken not to hurt thofe nervous parts. Jn this cafe 
you muft only foften them for fome time in warm water, and 
then pare off the furface, rubbing them afterwards with hot 
linfced oil, and laying a plafter of the mucilages over them. 
Thofe that ufe cauftics, aqua fortis, or butter of antimony, 
often occafion temble accidents. Some aJvife the cinnabar 
plafter of Bates, and recommend it from experience, 

COSTiVENESS. This diforder, when obftinate, is gene- 
rally owing to fpafms in the guts, and is a ufual fymptom of 
convulfions, and the falling ficknefs. It creates wind, makes 
the excrements appear in little buttons like {beep's dung, and 
other bad confequences, efpecially in thofe that are hyfteric or 
hypochondriac. When it is conftitutional, it may be borne 
a iui;g time without danger. Common coftivenefs may be 

cured 



-1 K)e F A M I L Y P H Y S I C I A N. 27 

cured by purging mineral waters, purging falts, an ounce 
of Epfom fait, half an ounce of vitriolated taitar, or any 
other neutral fait and lenitive elecluary. When the harclnefs of 
the excrements is the caufe, eat ripe iummer fruit, or fcalded 
apples, or throw up a clyfter made with half an ounce of foft 
foap, diflblved in half a pint of warm water. 

COUGHS. Thefe may be commonly cured with thirty 
drops of Friar's balfam, taken every four hours, or anifated 
balfam of fulphur, from three drops to ten, thrice a day. When 
a cough is obftinate, firft bleed, and then take three or four 
fpoonfuls of the following mixture every fourth hour : " Take 
" fix ounces of fpring water, an ounce and half of fallad 
" oil, an ounce of pe&oral fyrup, and forty drops of fpirit of 
" harrfhorn ; mix them." When it is ftubborn, and has con- 
tinued fome time, omit oily medicines, and take away from 
four to feven ounces of blood, repeating it once in eight or ten 
days, and give half a dram of the following pills tv/icea day ; 
* c Take half an ounce of Alicant foap, gum ammoniac pre- 
" pared, hog-lice, and frefh fquills, of each half an ounce; 
" of balfam ofCapivi, enough to make them into pills." 

COUGH, hooping. VVhen the child is full of blood, or 
the fpittle is tindured with blood, bleed, efpecially when there 
is a fmall fever, or the child looks black in the face with cough- 
ing. Soon after a vomit muft be given with half a fpoonful 
or a fpoonful, or upwards, of oxymel of fquills, according ,t* 
the child's age, which will bring up the vifcid phlegm. When 
there is a large quantity, it muft be repeated more than once; 
or he may take the decodl'on of twenty grains of ipecauanha. 
Then the body muft be Joofened with about ten grains of rhu- 
barb, to which two or three grains of alkalifated mercury may 
be added. When there is a difficulty of breathing, and an 
oppreflion of the breaft, you may give a fpoonful of milk of 
gum ammoniac, three or four times a day : likewile give eight 
grains of the bark four times a day; or, which is better, 
< f Take fix drams of the extra<St of the bark, twenty grains 
*' ofcamphire, and twenty cf cantharides ; mix them." Ten 
grains of this fhould be given every third or fourth hour, in 
any water fweetened with fyrup of cloves. When a (harp 
thin rheum drops on the lungs, this muft be. omitted, and 
a blifter muft be laid to the back. 

CRAM P . When a cramp is violent, and there is any ftop- 
paie of the ufual evacuation of bloond, the patient muft bleed, 
gs ajfo when the patient is full of blood, and the evacuations 

if

if pofllble muft be reftored. If this method fails, recourfe muft 
be had to the fame remedies as in the falling ficknefs. Out- 
wardly, rub the part with Hungary water, or the faponaceous 
liniment, commonly called opodeldoc ; as alfo with the green 
oil alone, or mixt with eflential oil of rofemary. Likewife, 
the back bone, from the neck downwards, may.be rub'd with 
the fame things. When the part continues hard, anoint it 
with ointment of marfh-mallows, or neats foot oil, or the 
green ointment, or the oil of amber. If thefe fail, recourfe 
muft be had to the temperate baths, the drinking mineral waters, 
ufmg regular diet, and keeping the mind eafy. 

CRISIS Various are the opinions of authors, about the 
nature and certainty of a crifis; but leaving them to their own 
judgments, I (hall only relate what is agreeable to obfervation 
and experience. The crifis has been defined by feme to be a 
fudden change in a difeafe, either for life or death. Thefe 
changes happen on certain days, which are called critical days : 
they are reckoned by feptenaries, and femifeptenaries, that is, 
every feven days, and half feven days or three days and a half. 
This crifis is performed by excretions ; that is, by fw eat, ftool, 
or an hasmorr. ;ige. On all other days, they are only fympto- 
jmatical. 

The fever called an ephemera, comes to a crifis in twenty- 
four hours, and then ceafes. A continual fe\er without re- 
irtifllon, the fourth day or feventh, by a bleeding at the nofe 
with fleepinefs, or a large fweat. Burning and bilious fevers, on 
the fourth or eleventh day, by a profufe fweat, often by a flux 
of the belly. A continual tertian remits on the third or fourth 
day, and turns to an intermittent. Catarrhal and epidemic 
fevers have been obferved to remit on the th rd or fourth day, 
with puftules about the nofe and lips, and an itching fweat. 
A flight pleurify has gone off between the third and fourth 
day, with the expectoration of bloody matter with a cough ; 
in very young perfons on the feventh; in thofe that are older, 
and the difeafe more violent, on the fourteenth, with a large 
fweat, copious fpitting, and a free rcfpiration. A baflard pleu- 
rify generally enJs on the feventh or eleventh day, by a fweat 
or loofe-efs. 

An erydpclaceous fever abates between the third and fourth 
day, when an acrid bilious matter is Tent to the fkin. The 
plague throws out buboes and carbuncles on the third, fourth, 
or feventh ci-v. The fmall pox and meailes ger.eially appear 
between the ;hl:J and fourth t'.ay. In the jpottcd fever, the

fpots appear on the fourth or feventh day. There is a kind of 
crifis in intermitting fevers, by fcabby eruptions about the lips 5 
and many chronic difeafes go off by eruptions on the fkin, ulce- 
rous puftules, and the like. Likewife fleepy difeafes, the 
vertigo and convulfive afthma, have been turned into the 
gout. 

DEAFNESS. Thepaflage into the ear maybe fometimes 
obftrucled with wax, and be the caufe of deafnefs ; or the 
drum of the ear may be ulcerated, corroded, or broken. Like- 
wife the auditory nerve may be obftrucled, relaxed, or com- 
prefled. Exceflive noife, as that of a cannon, will fometimes 
caufe deafnefs. When there is any thing in the outwjrd cavity 
of the ear, which caufes the obftruclion, it may be eafily feen. 
When the fault is in the nerve, a grain of calomel taken every 
night for a month in conferve of rofes, has had good fuccefs. 
When wax plugs up the ear, it muft be taken out carefully with 
a proper inftrument. When the nerve is relaxed, put three 
drops of the following mixture into the ear : " Take a quarter 
" of an ounce of the tin&ure of caftor, fix grains of mufk, 
" fix drops of oil of rofemary, and two drops of the oil of 
" cloves ; mix them." They may be dropt on cotton wool, 
and put into the ear every evening ; or two grains of mufk 
alone may be put into the ear, which has frequently been of 
great fervice. 

DIABETES. This happens when the patient makes water 
too often, and too much, exceeding in quantity the liquor 
drank. It is attended with a thirft, a wafting of the body, a 
heat in. the bowels, with frothy fpittle. Briftol water is a good 
remedy on this occafion, as alfo lime water, which may be 
drank from three half pints, to three pints in a day, as occa- 
fion (hall require. Or you may boil a pint of milk a very lit- 
tle while, and then diflblve in it three drams of roch alum j 
take off the curd, and give the patient a gill of it three times a 
day, if the itomach will bear it ; if not, lefs. Or you may 
quench a hot iron in new milk fo often as to ccnfume a third 
part; the dofe is a gill twice a day. To perfect the cure, 
" Take an ounce and half of the bark, half an ounce of roch 
** alum, and make them into an electuary with a fufficienr 
<c quantity of the fyrup of lemons." Let the patient take the 
quantity of a large nutmeg thrice a day. 

DEMULCENTS, and EMOLLIEN.TS, are fuch things as 
blunt, flieath, or involve the corroding burning acrimony of 
the fluids : they likewife relax zr.d mollify hard rigid tenfe

fibres, render them flexible, and dilate the veflels contracted 
by ftrictures. Demulcents are of great ufe in poifons ; for 
milk* oil, and fat taken plentifully, will blunt their fpicula or 
points, relax the fpafms of the membranes, and promote their 
expulfton by vomit or flool. Emollients given in infufion or 
deco&ion, when in chronic difeafes the acrimony of the hu- 
mours affect the nerves, have commonly wonderful fuccefs, 
even in convulfions attended with madnefs, and fcorbutic con- 
tractions of the joints, with a violent colic : thefe are roots of 
marfli-mallow and piony, leaves of mallows and camomile- 
flowers, borrage-flowers, white-lilies, elder-flowers, wild 
poppy-flowers, figs and fennel-feeds ; a plentiful decodion of 
thefe fhould be ufed, made in water or whey ; with a little oil 
of fweet-almonds, and a bath of new milk and water. 

The marrow of animals taken inwardly, is very good in an 
acrid fcorbutic ftateof the humours : fweet whey, faponaceous 
fubftances, foapitfclf taken often in a morning fatting, with a 
draught of hot liquor, are proper in the wafting of a limb, crack- 
ling of the bones, the flying-gout, and pains in the joints : in the 
ulcers of the kidneys and bloody urine, attending the fmall-pox, 
gum-tragacanth or cherry-tree-gum, or the dried white of an 
egg duTolved in whey, are of great ufe: cream and new milk 
are very good in hedtic-heats, proceeding from the acrimony of 
the humours which arife from a fault in the bowels : in all 
{harpnefs of the humours, as well as in a vomiting and loofe- 
nefs, a bloody-flux, the fcurvy, a fcorbutic confumption, a 
confumption of the lungs, it will be proper to give jellies, 
made with hartfhorn, or calves feet, or flieeps trotters. In 
coftivenefs from a ftriclure of the inteftines, oil of fweet-alr 
monds, whey, water-gruel, or hartmorn, will be ufeful either 
taken by the mouth or fi'iven in clyfters. Mucilage of quince^ 
feeds, is good in erofions and ulcerations of the parts, with 
heat and pain ; fuch as the thrufh, the blind and painful piles, 
tcnefmus, bloody-flux, and the whites in women, which cor- 
rode the parts. 

DIAPHORETICS are fuch medicines as gently promote 
perfpiration, which of all evacuations is the moft falutary ; for 
it. fupprefiion occasions various difeafes. On the contrary, 
the promotion of it corrects, refolves, digefts and difcufles the 
morbific matter, whereby difeafes are fafcly cured. In acute 
difeafes and fevers, as well as in inflammations of every kind, 
diaphoretics alone, given in fmall dofes for fome time in pro- 
per vehicles, anfwcr all the intentions of cure, and are the beft 

purifiers 



FAM ILY PH Y s i c i AN. 31 

purifiers of the mafs of blood. Earthy and alkaline fubftances 
may become diaphoretics, fuch as bole-armoniac and burnt 
hartfhorn, by deftroying acids which reprefs the fpirituous 
parts of the blood : others by the vapours of a foft anodyne 
fulphur, which relax theftritures of the fkin, and eafe pain ; 
as the flowers of elder- faffiron, wild poppy-flowers, gentle 
opiates, camphire, emulfions of poppy-feeds, and the thebaic 
tindlure. Others abate the violent inteftine motion of the 
blood, as fmall dofes of nitre with fixed diaphoretics, dulcified 
fpirit of nitre, emulfions of the greatly cold feeds, the juice of 
lemons and vinegar: others again gently ftimulate the fibres, 
fuch as carduus benedidtus, fcordium, farfaparilla, the lefler 
centaury, contrayerva-root, Virginian fnake-root, faffafras, 
and zedoary. 

DIET. The moft general rule of eating and drinking with 
regard to health, is to proportion the quantity and quality of our 
food to our digeftive powers. Hunger mews the beft time of eat- 
ing, butcuftom confines us to certain hours, which however, 
are different in different countries, in feveral parts of the fame 
country, and even in various parts of this great metropolis. 
Perfons that find no inconvenience from dining and Tupping 
every day, need not change their manner of life : but large 
fuppers, and thofe that are hard of digeftion, fhould be avoided 
by every body that would have quiet reft, a clean mouth, an 
eafy ftomach, and a clear head. 

Solid aliments are taken from feeds, fruits, leaves, (talks and 
roots ; of all which the feeds are moft laboured, and contain a 
mealy and milky fubftance, and yield a foft oil which is very 
friendly to human bodies. The principal preparation of feeds, 
is bread, which is made of wheat, barley, rye, oats and Indian 
corn. Wheat yields moft nourishment, barley is dry and promotes 
coftivenefs, rye is laxative ; oat-cakes are eaten in moft parts of 
| Scotland, and the north of England, without any inconveni- 
I ence. Indian-corn is much ufed in our plantations in north 
America, and is efteemed a wholefome food. The cruft of 
bread is moft eafy of digeftion, the crum being more oily and 
heavy : Some preparations of rice, barley and oats, are moift- 
ening, emollient and reftorativc : Nuts, almonds and cheftnuts, 
are full of a nourishing oil, but are very hard of digeftion. 
Peafe, beans and lentiles, nourifh much, but they are heavy, 
windy and vifcous, and confequently their too frequent ufe 
will caufe obftruclions. 



32 fbe FAMILY PHYSICIAN* 

Fruits, which are pulpy and tart abound with water, and are 
ufeful in hot weather, being moiflening, refreshing and feda- 
tive, becaufe they quench thirft, abate the too rapid motion 
of the blood, and readily pafs off the ftomach, unlels eaten too 
largely; fuch as flraw-berries, goofe-berries, currants, peaches, 
apricots, pears, apples and figs: they mould be eaten ripe 
and in fmall quantities, but as they are windy, they are beft 
boiled or baked, or made into fweet- meats. 

Pot-herbs^ fallad-herbs and roots, are lefs nourifliing than 
the feeds abovementioned. Lettice, fuccory, purflain and for- 
"rel, refrefh, moiften, loofen the belly, and appeafe the orgafm 
of the blood : cellery, crefles, parfley, afparagus, and arti- 
chokes, are a little heating :. jnuftard, pepper, fhallots, onionsj 
garlic, cloves, mace, nutmegs, champignons, truffles, heat 
very much. 

It may be obferved in general with regard to vegetables, 
that thofe are beft which arrive at perfection at their own na- 
tural feafon ; not fuch as are forced by hot beds. The like 
may be t faid of animals, for all cramm'd poultry, and ftall-fed 
cattle, are not fo good as thofe that are brought up in a natu- 
ral manner. 

Fifh abounds with moifture, and is not fo nourifliing as the 
flelh of four-footed animals, and in general pafles more readily 
off the ftomach > I fay in general, becaufe falmon and fome 
others are hard of digeftion. The flefh of young animals is 
the propereft food for tender delicate conftitutions j the juices 
of the old are fpirituous, gelatinous, and more agreeable to the 
tafte, but their flefh is hard of digeftien. Wild animals are 
always preferable to the tame of the fame kind ; and thofe that 
live on vegetables or light frod, are better than thofe that live 
on other animals or hard food. 

Plain dreflcd food is eafier of digeftion, than what is pickled, 
falted, baked, or any way high feafonedj belides, the conftant 
ufe of high feafoned, falted, fmoak-dried meats, together 
with acids, as well as fpirituous liquors, inftead of yielding 
pood nouriftiment, tend to harden and ftiffen the parts of the 
body, and to breed various difeafes, by rendering the blood 
acrid, and rending the fmall capillary vcflels. Children 
fhould be fed with light, thin, {lender, foft aliment, which is 
eafy of digeftion, or with the milk of a woman newly brought 
to bed, which is better than that which is older. Old perfons 
likewife, fhould have foft, nourifhing, moiftening food, eafy 
of digeftion, and not too much at a time, efpecially in the 
evening. Upon 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 33 

Upon the whole, the beft method of preferring health, is to 
live upon plain, fimple aliment, lightly feafoned, if at all ; in a 
quantity and quality agreeable to the age, ftrength of the fto- 
mach, feafon of the year, fex, or constitution ; but more e- 
fpecially what nature has been found by experience to require. 
Perfect digeftion is the beft rule of regulating a meal, efpeci- 
aliy if the perfon is more brifk and lively after a repaft, than 
before. For farther particulars, fee the account of aliments. 

DIGESTION, want of. This is attended with wind in the 
ftomach, and frequent belching : fometimes the corrupt hu- 
mours therein produce a fenfe of weight, and a pain. It may 
be caufed by bad diet, or too plentiful feeding, efpecially upon 
things that are fat and oily, with a fedentary life and idlenefs. 
In this laft cafe it will be proper to give a vomit, and then chew 
rhubarb to carry the humours downwards. The fpaw-waters 
are very good in this cafe, with a fpare diet and exercife: add 
to thefe, bitters, ftomachicsandftreugtheners. 6W APPETITE

DIURETICS. Thefe are medicines that promote the fecre- 
tion of urine. Little urine, or difficulty of making water, may 
proceed from want of moijlure in the blood. Then water, whey, 
tea, coffee, fpaw-water, or any aqueous fluid, will anfwer the 
purpofe. Spaw-water is excellent in this cafe, becaufe it will 
diflblve vifcid and tenacious humours, as well as open obftruc- 
tions of the kidneys. % When grofs thick juices objlrufl the uri- 
nary pajfogesy fixed, alkaline, or lixivial falts will be proper ; 
or Alicant or Caftile foap, or tartar vitriolated, or the diuretic 
fait, or lime-water. When there isfpafm of the tubes of the kid- 
ney^ then nitre will be proper ; as alfo emulnons of the greater 
Cold feeds, or of poppy- feeds, or faffron, or oil of fweet-al- 
monds. When the tubes of the kidneys are too much refaxed, give 
the natural balfams, or turpentine, or rob of juniper-berries, 
alum poflet-drink, or decoctions of ground-ivy, and male- 
fpeedwel. When thejlrength of thefe tubes is almofl //?, then 
you may direct ftimularing diuretics, fuch as hogs-lice, leeks, 
garlic, or cantharides. 

In a fit of the gravel, hot ftimulating diuretics are impro- 
per; but emulfions of white poppy- feeds are good, together 
with nitre, dulcified fpirit of nitre, oil of fvveet-almonds, and 
whey, as alfo emollient baths and fomentations. Stimulating 
diuretics are good for ruftics, and perfons that feed coarfly, for 
women that have the whites, in a gonorrhaea, and a difpofition 
to a dropfy. When there are grofs humours in the bladder? the

FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

.j * 

moft acrid diuretics are beft, fuch as garlic taken with the fpi- 
rit of juniper, powder of millepedes, tincture of cantha- 
rides, C5c. 

In general the mof. proper, fafe and ufeftil diuretics are fait of 
tartar, fait of wormwood, fixed nitre, ftibiated nitre, vitriola- 
tcd tartar, diuretic fait and fal polychrcftum : diuretics, efpeci- 
ally the fixt falts and faponaceous medicines, are the beft prefer- 
vatives againft thedropfy, ftone and gout, whether in the feet, 
or what is called the flying gout. 

DROPSY. There arc three forts of dropfies ; the one is 
when water ftagnates in or is fhed all over the body under the 
fkin, which at laft gets into the belly, and under the fkin of 
the private parts in men. Another kind, is when the water is 
only collected in the belly. Another kind, is when the belly 
is puffed up with wind, and will found when ftruck : this is 
Jcnown by the name of a tympany. The firft approach of the 
dropfy may be perceived by a fwelling of the feet and ankles, 
which will pit in the evening when prefled by the fingers ; e- 
fpecially if there be a difficulty of breathing. In the morning 
this fwelling difoppears. When the feet and legs are greatly 
fwelled, the water rufhes into the belly, and caufes it to fwell 
by little and little to a very great bulk. 

The cure is to be performed by emetic-wine, purgatives, 
clyfters and diuretics. An ounce and a half, or two ounces of 
emetic-wine may be given in a morning, and it will in due 
time free the belly from the load of waters. It muft be re- 
peated as the patient's itrength will permit : if it does not purge 
downwards, it muft be mixt with fyrup of buckthorn after the 
third or fourth dofe. The beft purge is two grains of elateri- 
um : but if the patient is eafily purged, an ounce of fyrup of 
buckthorn alone will be fufEcier.t. 

Some cannot bear either vomits or purge?, and then the cure 
is to be attempted by iuch things as promote urine, thus : 
" Take a pound of broom- afhes, an ounce of leaves of worm- 
" wood, and two quarts of Rhenifh wine, mix them together 
" cold, and let ftand a day or two." A gill of the clear 
HjUo- muft be given in the morning, at five in the after- 
ri.ion, and at night. Or, " take three quarters of a pint of 
*' boiling water, and pour it on half an ounce of the leaves 
" of wormwood, and a dram of fait of tartar. When the 
tc liquor is cold ftrain it, and add half a gill of compound 1 
" juniper water." This ferves for three dofes, and muft be : 
taken in a day : it is of excellent fervice in dropfies,

ceeding fevers. Or, " take an ounce of broom -tops, boil 
'* them in a fufficient quantity of water to a quart." Then 
give the patient a fpoonful of whole mullard feed night and 
morning;, drinking after each dofe, half a pint of the decoction. 
Likewife a dram of nitre taken in a morning in a draught of 
ale, has cured the dropfy, when every thing elfe failed : Or, 
he may take fix grains of the powder of (quills, in a draught 
of warm gruel, mixt with a glafs of mountain-wine. Or, 
" take of the frefti root of fquills, fix grains ; of the com- 
" pound-powder of arum, ten grajns ; of ginger, five grains. 
" Pound them together, and make them into a bolus, with the 
" fyrup of orange-peel " This is to he taken every morning* 
When the bowels are found, the laft refuge is tapping. 

When atympany fucceeds the bloody-flux, or agues, it will be 
fufficient to keep the body open, by giving a fcruple of rhubarb 
every night, with five grains of the aromatic fpecies. When the 
fwelling begins to give way, then order the following electuary : 
" Take two drams of camomile-flowers, and beat them toge- 
" ther with a little fyrup of orange-peel ; then add two drams 
.*' of powder of ginger, and a dram of fieel prepared with 
" fulphur, with enough of the fyrup beforementioned to 
" make an electuary. " The dofe is the fize of a large nut- 
meg, twice a day. 

DRY BELLY-ACH. See BELLY-ACH, dry. 

EAR-ACH. Sometimes the pain of the ear is fo very vio- 
lent, that it may have very bad confequences ; in which cafe it 
will be neceflary to take thirty drops of liquid laudanum, and 
to put a little bit of opium in the middle of a bit of flicking 
plafter, and to lay it to the temple on the affected fide. After- 
wards let the ear be held over a hot decodiion of camomile- 
flowers in milk. You may likewife fill a hog's bladder with the 
fame decoction, and lay it to the ear. In milder cafes, a few 
drops of fp'nit of wine and carnphire may, with cotton-woo!, 
be put into the ear, rubbing the parts behind the ear with the 
fame: Or, rub a dram of carnphire, with an ounce of the oil 
o f fweet-almonds, and ufe it in the fame manner. When any 
thing isgot intotheear,rub the paflage with oil of fweet almonds ; 
then give the patient fomething to make him fneeze, and it 
will be forced out. When the pain comes after fevers, with a 
fwelling of the glands under the ear, cupping on the neck with 
fcarification will yield relief. Worms in the ears may be 
enticed out by warm new milk, or killed with oil of worm- 
wood or almonds.

ERRHINES are fubftances that promote a running at the 
nofe, by ftimulating the pituitary glandulous coat of the nof- 
trils. The milder are called errhines, and the ftronger fternu- 
tatories, becaufe they caufe fneezing. Powders compounded 
of marjoram, marum fyriacum, flowers of benjamin, lilly 
of the valley, the rafpings of lignum aloes, and a grain or two 
of ambergrife, are good in heavy pains of the head, the head- 
ach, fleepy difeafes, weaknefs of memory, running at the nofe, 
difficulty of hearing, a mucous defluxion on the eyes, giddi- 
nefs, and add frefh vigour to the animal functions. Volatile 
fal amoniac mixt with oil of marjoram, and two or three 
grains put up the nofe, has a remarkable virtue in dimnefs of 
fight and difficulty of hearing, in fleepy difeafes, in the palfey 
and apoplexy from a cold caufe. The ftronger errhines are 
pepper, afarabacca, precipitated mercury, powder of white- 
hellebore and euphorbium ; however thefe three laft muft be 
ufed with the utmoft caution. But after all, there is nothing 
better than the watry extract of guaiac dried and reduced to 
a powder, for it has not only a ftimulating but a ftrengthening 
property, and is friendly to the nerves. 

ERYSIPELAS, or St. ANTHONY'S FIJIE. This is common- 
ly reckon'd a difeafe of the (kin, but is more properly an erup- 
tive fever : it begins with chilnefs and fhivering ; when of a 
very bad kind with a great making, a violent pain in the back 
and heat, a vomiting, and a delirium. The eruption generally 
attacks the head and face, but fometimes appears in other parts 
of the body. The tumour is fuperficial, and appears fuddenly 
on the fkin, with a fharp burning heat, and a lively red co- 
lour, which turns white when prefled by the finger. It fre- 
quently terminates in veficles full of a fharp ferous liquor. Some- 
times the tumour fubfides in a day or two, the heat and pain 
ceafe, the rofy colour turns yellow, the cuticle breaks and falls 
off in fcales, and then the danger is over. But if the eryfi- 
pelas is large, deep, and falls upon a part of exquifite fenfe, 
the patient is not very fafe : if the red colour changes into 
black and blue, it will end in a mortification. When the fe- 
ver is attended with difficulty of breathing, a delirium, orflee- 
pinefs, the patient fometimes dies in feven days time. 

The curemuft be begun by taking away eight or ten ounces 
of blood, efpecially if the patient is plethoric, or addicted to 
fpirituous liquors, or when the difeafe attacks the head. In 

this 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 37 

this laft cafe, give the following purging draught, and lay a 
blifter to the back ; otherwife the following may be omitted : 
" Take Epfom fait and manna, of each three quarters of an 
c< ounce; of boiling water three ounces: when the fait and 
" manna are difiblved, ftrainoii the liquor, and then add a dram 
fl of the tin&ure of cardamoms." When the head is free, dia- 
phoretics will be fufficient. " Take of rob of elder-b^rr^s 
*' an ounce, of burnt hartfliorn a dram, of fimple alexiterial 
*' water four ounces; mix and make a draught:" Or, 
" Take Mindererus's fpirit, and fyrup of white poppies, of 
" each half an ounce ; mix them for a draught." When the 
patient is very hot, add twelve grains of nitre to the firft dia- 
phoretic draught. Afterwards cap-paper or linen rags may be 
dipt in the following mixture, and laid pretty warm to the 
part : <e Take of camphorated fpirit of wine half a pint, of 
" Venice treacle two ounces ; mix them :" Or equal parts of 
camphorated fpirit of wine and lime-water, will anfvver the 
fame end. When the part tends to a mortification, give the 
Peruvian bark inwardly, and apply hot tincture of myrrh out- 
wardly with linen rags. 

EXCREMENTS. Regular ftools are a fign of health, but 
when they err either in quantity, quality, or time, they denote 
fome diforder. Coftivenefs creates and exafperates difeafes of 
the head, as is obfervable in the head-ach, epilepfy, madnefs, 
melancholy, thepalfy, and inflammation of the eyes and hardnefs 
of hearing. No fever makes its attack without previous coftive- 
nefs j and when the (tools begin to be natural, it is a promifmg 
fign of health. White or grey excrement denotes the jaun- 
dice : green ftools are common to fucking children, with 
the gripes and convulfion fits. Excrements mixt with pure 
blood with little pain, (hews the diforder is the piles : but 
when there are great pains about the navel, with frequent 
ftools, it is the bloody-flux. In all difeafes, if the body is 
coftive, it fhould be kept open by laxatives. Some perfons are 
naturally coftive when in health, and then it may be borne with- 
out any great inconvenience. 

EXERCISE. This, properly made ufe of, is an excellent 
means to preferve and reftore health. Children are fond of it ; 
and thofe that make moft ufe of it, have founder conftitutions 
[than thofe that fit moping at home. Walking is the beft exer- 
|cife to preferve health before it is loft, or when it has been re- 
jtrieved; but riding on horfeback is moft proper to regain it. 
Riding in a coach agrees beft with the very infirm, as well as 

C 3 young 



^S The FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

young children. That exercife is beft which is ufcd on an 
empty ftomach, at leaft after breakfaft ; and fhould never be 
continued to wearinefs : and then it increafes the circulation 
of the blood, attenuates and divides the fluids, promotes perfpi- 
ration and a due fecretion of the humours, ISrengthens the 
parts, creates an appetite, and helps digeiiicns ; wherefore thoie 
that ufe exercife are generally very robuft, and feldom fubject to 
difeafes. But immoderate exercife difiipatesthe (pirits, weakens 
the body, dtftroys the elafticity of the fibres, and exhaufts the 
fluid parts of the blood. 

The lungs are fortified by loud talking, and walking up an 
cafy afcent: riding helps digefcion, flrengthens the nerves, 
and cures feveral kinds of head-achs. Riding in a coach over 
the ftor.es, is good for the gravel in the kidneys, and will make 
fmali ftones to pafs downwards, that ftick in the ureters. 
Playing at tennis, billiards, bowls, &c. till a fweat is promoted, 
is good for rheumatick pains. Thofe that have feeble arm?, 
fhould play at fhuttle-cock cr tennis, and any fuch like game. 
Thofe that have weak hams, fhould kick a foot-ball, and the 
gouty may recover the ufe of their limbs by walking in rough 
roads, but the fits will be K'ngeft prevented by riding on 
horfe-back, or in a coach: thofe that are obliged to lead fcden- 
tary iivefhculd, if pcilible, walk an hour before dinner, and 
SS much before fupper. 

C oid-bathln^ is a kind of exerci r e, and is very advantageous 
to health ; but fhould never be made ufe of by thofe that have 
weak lungs o* tn2 t are under the fit of a chronical diftemper, 
with a quick pulfe, or the head-sen. The fiefh-brufh is a 
rnoft ufcful exercife, as is very evident from the effect it has 
upon horfes; for this by warming the parts diftributes the 
nourifhrncnt into every part of the body : likewife rubbing 
every part of the body with rough cloths or coarfe flannel, has 
not only been found to preferve health, but to contribute to 
the cure of feveral difeafes. 

EXPECTORANTS, are fuch things as promote the excre- 
tion of pituitous matter from the lungs. In the choice of thefe, 
it muftbe obferved, that when the humour is thin and the paf- 
fages ftraight, then emollients are beft, liquorice, faffron, 
fperma ccti, mallows, wild poppies, cream, oil of fweet-al- 
monds, diacodium, and hartihorn gtlly. When a plenty of 
thick matter fluffs the lungs, then refolvents are neceflary, as 
male fpeedwel, hyfiop, fcordium, diuretic fait, and ftibiated 
nitre : likewife things that ftimulate the nervous coats to ex-

cretion, fuch as gum ammoniac and its tincture, myrrh, ben- 
jamin, elecampane-root, florentine-orice, precipitated fulphur, 
and balfam of fulphur : when a greater fpur is. wanting, as in 
the pitukous afthma and fuffocating catarrh, then oxymel of 
fquills will be cf great fervice. 

We muft: obferve in the ufe of expe&ojants, that when a 
cough proceeds from a thin fharp matter, we ought to ufe no 
ftimulating medicines before it is temperated ; nor on the con- 
trary, we fhould not prefcribe emollients and relaxing things 
when the matter is concocted and prepared. In a moift chronic 
cough and pituitous afthma, when the lungs are fluffed with 
phlegm, lambatives, fyrups and oils tend to weaken the fto- 
mach, deftroy the appetite, digeftion and chylification, which 
will occafion a greater quantity of phlegm, which brings on a 
cachexy or the cedematous fwellings of the dropfy. In this 
cafe it will be beft to order balfamic-peclorals, Friar's balfam, 
tin&ure of myrrh, balfam of fulphur, or anifated balfam of 
fulphur. 

In a difpofition to a confumption or fpitting of blood, in a 
dry cough, in ftraitnefs or difficulty of breathing, in a com- 
preiling pain of the breaft, which arife rather from a con- 
geftion of blood, than from any thing that wants to be brought 
up, we muft neither mollify nor ftimulate, for the diforder 
will be increafed by fuch a pradice. In acute difeafes of the 
breaft, fuch as the pleurify and inflammation of the lungs, 
expectorants muft be cautioufly ufed, efpecially in the begin- 
ning, for fear of increafmg the inflammatory ftate of the blood : 
but when the difeafe is declining, then they will be proper to 
promote the ejection of thick concocted matter from the 
lungs. 

FALLING-SICKNESS. This Is fo called, becaufe when the 
patient has a fit, he falls fuddenly on the ground. \Vhen it 
gives warning of its coming, it may be known by a wearinefs 
of the whole body, unquiet fleep, unufual dread, dimnefs of 
fight, or a noife in the ears. In fome there is a fenfe of cold air 
arifing from the lower part of the brain. The fits are longer or 
fhorter, according to the different caufes ; fome return on certain 
days, hours, and even months; fome at the new or full moon, 
or both. In women often at the time of their monthly evacua- 
tions : fometimes the paflions of the mind will bring on a fit, e- 
fpecially a fudden fright. This difeafe generally ends of itfelf 
in boys when they are fit for marriage, in girls when their 
monthly evacuations begin to appear. Sometimes change O f

place, diet, and the way of living, will put an end to the fal- 
ling ficknefs. 

To perform a cure, blifters may be laid to the back part of 
the head, a little before the fit is expected, and then " Take 
" forty grains of valerian-root, and twenty grains of cinnabar ; 
" make them into a powder." This is one dofe, and muft 
be taken morning and evening, for three or four months. Or, 
rather, " Take of the peruvian bark one ounce, of valerian- 
** root a quarter of an ounce, and make them into an elec- 
" tuary with fyrup of orange-peel." The dofe is a dram, 
morning and night, for three or four months, and afterwards, 
two or three days before the full and change of the moon : but 
if two drams of Virginian fnake-root be added to the above 
electuary, it will make it {till better. Some recommend an 
ounce of mifletoe with a dram of afla foetida, made into a 
powder ; the dofe is half a dram every fixth hour, drinking a 
draught of a itrong infufion of the fame plant after each dofe. 
"When a patient is fo happy as to forefee the fit coming on, let 
the feet and legs be rubbed ftrongly with a coarfe cloth, which 
may prevent it. 

But, after all, there is nothing better than ten grains of mufk, 
taken twice a day ; unlefs a medicine lately difcovered, and 
which may be had at Mr. Newbery's in St. Paul's Church-yard, 
London. It has been ufed in fome of the London Hofpitals, 
with great fuccefs, in the cure of this obftinate difeafe, and has 
fucceeded when other remedies have failed, and perhaps is the 
very beft hitherto found out for this purpofe. I have been 
ivimefs to its efficacy in fome cafes of this kind myfelf. 

INTERMITTING FEVERS or AGUES, are of feveral 
forts : fometimes they come every day, and then they are called 
quotidian ; fometimes every other day, and then they are ter- 
tian ; fometimes there are two days between each fit, and then 
they are quartan or third day agues. An ague generally begins 
with coldnefs, fhivering and {baking, which is the cold fit, 
after which the hot or burning fit takes place, which is fuc- 
ceeded with a fweating, at which time the ague is over 
till the next return : the length of thefe fits differ very much, 
efpecially when they are epidemical or common, and fometimes 
there is fcarcely any cold fit at all, at others the hot fit is 
fcarcely perceptable. Spring agues may be generally cured 
with the bark alone, which you muft begin to give as foon as 
the fit is off, and not before : half a dram is a dofe, and fix of 
thefe dofes muft be given in twenty four hours, till the fit re- 
turns, 



FAMILY' PHYSICIAN. 4! 

turns, which it feldom does ; however, fome give a vomit 
before they will venture on the bark. To prevent a return, it 
will be proper to repeat the bark every eight or ten days, for 
three feveral times ; it may be taken in red wine, or made up 
into an electuary with fyrup of lemons. Thofe agues that hap- 
pen after the end of the fummer, are generally pretty obfti- 
nate, and then it will be neceflary to add two drams and a half 
of Virginian fnake-root to the electuary. When the counte- 
nance is yellow, the belly hard, and the body coftive, it will 
be neceflary to give the following electuary before the bark : 
" Take of Caftile foap an ounce, fpecies of hiera picra and 
44 fteel in filings, of each forty grains, of fyrup of orange- 
" peel a fufficient quantity to make an electuary." The dofe 
is half a dram, four times a day. Sometimes agues that will not 
yield to the bark, may be cured by the following powder : 
44 Take twenty grains of the powder of camomile-flowers, ten 
44 grains of diaphoretic antimony, and the fame quantity of 
44 fait of tartar ; make them into a bolus with fyrup of cloves :" 
it may be repeated every three hours, 

FEVER, REMITTING BILIOUS. Thefe aflTume the 
type of a quotidian or tertian, the cure is the fame in both, 
and are moft frequent in camps. It begins with chillirvefs, 
wearinefs, pains of the head and bones, and a diforder of the 
ftomach j at night the fever runs high, the heat and thirft are 
great, the tongue is parched, and the head achs violently : 
the patient cannot go to fleep, and often talks as if he had 
loft his fenfes : but in the morning a fweat brings on a remif- 
fion of all the fymptoms j in the evening it returns again, but 
without any cold fit, and is commonly worfe than before : 
thus it goes on till it turns to an intermitting or continual 
fever. 

Beginthe cure with bleeding, either in the remiflion or height 
of the fit ; then give a vomit with twenty grains of ipecacu- 
anha, and two grains of emetic-tartar, that it may work up- 
wards and downwards ; this muft be done in the remiflion of 
the fever, and if it brings away a great deal of corrupted gali, 
the cure is effected. When the body is coftive, and there are 
pains in the bowels, or a continual defirc of going to ftool, 
give a dram of vitriolated tartar, with ten grains of fait of 
tartar, diflblved in a convenient liquor, every fourth hour. 
This will not only open the body, but caufe the fever to inter- 
mit. Or when there is no coftivenefs, give the following 
julep. " Take of mint-water and fyrup of lemons of each 

" two 



42 Ibe FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

" two ounces, of fait of wormwood a dram ; mix them/' 
The dofe is a fpoonful every hour. When the patient does not 
fweat freely in the fit, give fome dofes of the following julep : 
" Take four ounces of fimple alexiterial- water or milk-wa- 
** ter, two ounces of Mindererus's fpirit, ten grains of volatile 
" fait of hartfhorn, and fix drams of loaf-fugar ; mix them." 
The dofe is two fpoonfuls every two hours : when the fever 
intermits, and the intermiflions are fhort, begin to give the bark 
before the fweating is quite over. If the patient has not been 
purged, add five grains of rhubarb to every dofe, till the body 
is open. When through neglect it is changed to a continual fe- 
ver, and the pulfe is full and hard, bleed in the arm ; when 
the pu'fe, is fmall and there is a pain in the head or a delirium, 
apply leeches to the temples, but blifters are the fureft remedy ; 
no vomits or purges muft be given, but clyfters may : likcwife 
the following powder every fixth hour. " Take of compound 
** powder of contrayerva twenty grains ; of pure nitre ten 
44 grains, of camphire three grains ; mix them/' If the pulfe 
and fpirits fink greatly, give ten grains of musk made into a 
bolus, and repeat it occasionally. 

FEVER, CATARRHALi This bears fome refemblance 
with the former as to the fits, for it begins in the evening, 
with fhivering and coldnefs of the hands and feer, but more 
particularly the feet and foals of the feet ; there is a weaknefs 
cf the head, a faintnefs of the whole body, thirft, difficulty 
of fwallowing, a heat in the noftrils, mouth and throat, at- 
tended with fneezing : add to thefe a weight in the breaft, and 
a frequent clefire to make water. At night the pulfe grows 
more quick and full with heat, a defluxion of rheum, unquiet 
fieep and fweating in the morning. The caufe of this fever is 
the fharpnefs of the ferum : hence a hoarfenefs, a cough, 
hanking up tough phlegm, a fneezing, a defiuxion on the 
lungs. 

To abate the {harpnefs of the humours, and to put the pa- 
tient i r ;to a breathing fweat, give the following powder every 
fourth or fixth hour. " Take compound powder of contra- 
" yerva twenty grains, Virginian fnake-root and faftron of 
" each five grains ; make a powder." To appeafe the cough, 
*' Take an ounce and a half of fallad-oil, fix ounces of 
" fpring-water, forty drops of fpirit of hartfliorn, and an 
" ounce of the pectoral fyrup ; mix them." The dofe is four 
fpoonfuls every fourth hour ; at night give fix grains of ftorax 
pills, unlefs the head is weak, for then they muft be -omitted : 

very

very heating and very cooling things are equally bad. If 
the body is coftive, open it with manna, diflblved in water- 
gruel ; or at night give twenty grains cf the aromatic pills, 
with four grains of itorax pills. When the fever is declining, 
and the cough is moft frequent and obftinate, give two ounces 
of manna in fennel-water, to carry the humours downwards ; 
or give a fcruple or half a dram of Rufus's pills. When the 
fever is over, and the lungs are weak and lax, give thirty drops 
of the traumatic or Friar's balfam, feveral times a day. You are 
to obferi'e that bleeding is hurtful in this fever. 

FEVER CONTINUAL, without rem>/icn. This is of the 
inflammatory kind, and though it begins with a mild fenfe of 
cold, yet it foon rifes very high, with grievous fymptoms ; it 
always affects one part of the body more than another : when 
it feizes the head, there is a ftrong beating of the temporal ar- 
teries, a fwimming in the head, a drowfinefs, a kind of ftupi- 
dity or a raving, with a pain therein, a fwelling of the face, 
and a rednefs of the eyes, which are full of tears. When it 
affects the heart and vefiel.-, of the lungs, there is a fhort difficult 
breathing, with a ftraitnefs of the breaft, a ftrong beating of 
the heart, with Icfs of ftrength and finking of the fpirits. 
Thus, from the particular oppreflion in any part, the feat of this 
fever may be always known. 

In the cure, to free the vital parts from the inflammatory 

congeftion of blood, the patient muft. lofe blood freely, and 

toe patient may be indulged with gelly of currants, or the 

juices of oranges or lemons } or a cooling drink may be made 

thus: " Take a quart of fpring- water, and mix it with juice 

" of oranges, rofe-water and loaf-fugar, of each an ounce." 

Or he may dri;;k whey with a little lemon-juice : then repeat 

the bleeding the next day if nothing forbids j if drops of blood 

proceed from the nofe, promote it with thrufting up a ftraw : 

if the patient was coftive before the difeafe, he muft take a 

laxative, otherwife clyfters are furHcicnt to procure ftools; the 

nitrous decolion will be likewife proper. " Take two pints 

" and a half of fprin2;-water, with two ounces of fugar, 

" half an ounce of nitre, and a fcruple of cochineal ; boil 

" them to a quart." The dofe is a gill thrice a day. Or give 

the diaphoretic mixture, with fpirit of Mindererus, mentioned in 

the remitting bilious fever. When the jpirits fnk, and the in- 

fiammatory fymptoms Jlili remain, then, and not before, blifters 

may be ufed, and they will prove the chief remedy ; lay one 

firft to the back, then the next day to the legs and thighs, re-

fcrvin the arms for the Jaft : in great lownefs, attended with 
a delirium, fmapifms muft be laid to the feet. Opiates are al- 
ways unfafe in this difeafe. But let me remind you once for #//, 
that the fafeft and fpecdiefl cure in this difeafi, is Dr. jAMES's 
FEVER-POWDER, and not only in this but in all INFLAM- 
MATORY FEVERS, PUTRID, YELLOW and NER- 
VOUS FEVERS, as well as ACUTE RHEUMATISMS j 
and therefore a great deal of hazard and trouble may be fpared 
in attempting the cure any other way. 

FEVERS affeaing INFANTS. Acidity is the chief caufe 
of fevers in children, and therefore the cure depends on de- 
llroyingit; this is done by rendering them fit to be expelled, 
and then purging them out of the body. This is effected by ab- 
forbir.g them with prepared oifter (hells, or compound powder 
of crabs claws. When the child is about a year old, '* take 
" a dram of the compound powder of crabs claws, forty 
" grains of prepared crabs eyes, and fix grains of cochineal ; 
" mix them :" divide this powder into fix parts, and give a dofe 
immediately. If the cafe is urgent, another two hours after- 
xvari's, and then every fourth hour, unlefs prevented by fleep; 
this may be done for two days, in a fpoonful of the following 
iulep. " Take of fimple alexiterial water fix ounces, of fpiri- 
*' tuous alexiterial water half an ounce, of double refined 
* 4 fugar half an ounce, mix them :" another fpoonful may be 
taken to wafh it down. When there is a cough, give a fmall 
fpoonful of the following julep : " Take four ounces of pen- 
" nyroyal-water, two ounces of fyr up of marfti-m allows, and 
<: one ounce of fyrup of balfam ; mix them." On the third 
day, unlefs the meafies or fmall-pox appear, give the following 
laxative. '* Take a quarter of an ounce of folutive fyrup of 
" rofes, ten grains of rhubarb, and a quarter of an ounce of 
" fimple alexiterial water ; mix them." When there is any 
unufual fymptoms arifing from putrid humours, it will be beft 
to give fix grains of Ethiops mineral the night before the purge, 
in a fpoonful of any agreeable fyrup : after the purge, the ab- 
forbent powders are to be repeated three or four times in twen- 
ty four hours, for two days and two nights ; on the third day, 
the purge is to be repeated, which muft be made ftronger or 
weaker, according to the operation of the former; by thefe 
means the fymptoms generally ceafe. 

FEVER MILIARY. This begins with fhivering, fuc- 
ceeded with heat and lofs of ftrerigth ; there is a ftraitnefs 
about tbebreaft, attended with anxiety and deep fighs, reftlefs- 

nefs

nefs and watching; at leaft the flcep is very unquiet and dif- 
turbed : there is a pricking kind of heat perceived in the back, 
with an alternate fucceffion of cold, fhivering, and heat under 
the fkin, but is moft fenfible in the palms of the hands. Child- 
bed women have the lochia ftopt, and the milk leaves their 
breafts. Then comes on a roughnefs of the fkin, like that of 
a goofe, and a great number of puftules or pimples appear, 
fometimes white, fometimes red, or bo'h together, of the fize 
of millet or muftard feed. They firft appear on the neck, 
then the breaft and back, afterwards the arms and hands. When 
thefe pimples begin to rife, the more grievous fymptoms ceafe. 
When they are ripe, they are full of ftinking matter. In feven 
or eight days, the puftules dry and fall off in fcales. Sometimes 
they appear on the fourth day, fometimes on the feventh, and 
fometimes not till the fourteenth. 

The cure muftbe begun with moderate bleed ing, unlefs the 
patient be in a fweat, in which cafe it muft be omitted or put 
off to a more convenient time. L/ikewife, when this fever 
makes its attack with fudden lofs of ftrength, the patient muft 
iofe no blood. Bliftersare generally neceflary, efpecialiy when 
the pimples (bike in, and then they may be applied to the neck 
and calves of the legs. When there is internal heat, thirft, 
and a large pulfe, give the following bolus every fixth hour : 
" Take fperma ceti and compound powder of crabs claws, of 
" each twenty grains ; of purified nitre, fix grains ; of faf- 
" fron, five grains ; make them into a bolus with the fyrup of 
" red poppies." But when there are figns of malignity, with 
coldnefs of the external parts, and heat by fits, nitre muft be 
omitted. When there is a great number of tranfparent blad- 
ders, or pimples hardly viable, give powerful alexipharmacs ; 
fuch as, twelve grains of mufk made into a bolus, with the 
fame quantity of the cordial confection ; or endeavour to carry 
off the difeafe with laxatives, fuch as manna, rhubarb, or Ep- 
fom fait. If, after the difeafe is cured, the patient fhould be 
troubled with a thrufh or hiccuping, they will readily give way 
to a few dofes of the bark. 

FEVER NERVOUS. This comes on with flight tran- 
fient chilneffes, often in a day, and uncertain flufhes of heat. 
They are liftlefs, and feem to be quite weary ; they are apt to 
jfigh, and complain of a heavinefs, finking of the fpirits, with 
la load, pain and giddinefsin the head; as alfoto yawn and doze; 
they have no ftomach, and difrelifh every thing; they have 
a reaching to vomit, but bring up little or nothing. The 
7 breath-

breathing is difficult by fits, and at night all the fymptoms grow 
worie with a LOW, QUICK, UNEQJJAL PULSE, which muji 
be particularly cbferved, as being an infeparable fign of this difeafe. 
The countenance is heavy and dejected ; fometimes they are 
quite wakeful, or if they fall afleep, they will not own it. 
They make water often and fuddcnly. The urine is pale. 
There is often a dull pain and coldnefs on the hind part of the 
head, or a heavy pain on the top of it. 1 hefe commonly pre- 
cede a delirium. About the eighth day, the giddinefs, pain, 
or heavinefs of the head become much greater, and all the 
fymptoms are ftronger. The patient is fubjecl to faint in at- 
tempting to fit up, which may be fometimes fatal, and there- 
fore muft be avoided. 

In tr.e cure, all ftrong medicines muft befhunned : hewever, 
a gentle puke may be given at firft, and clyfters of milk, fugar, 
and fait may be thrown up every fecond or third day. Blifters 
and mild diaphoretics are chiefly to be depended upon ; for a 
breathing fweat gives eafe, but a large one is pernicious. 
" Take of the compound powder of crabs-claws, fifteen grains ; 
*' faffron, caflxr, of each three grains; mix them and make 
" a powder." This may be taken every fourth or fixth hour, 
jn fack whey or foft wine. This laft is a great cordial in this 
difeafe, and will fupport and revive the fpirits ftrangely ; for 
which reafon, cordial juleps fhould not be given by fpoonfuls, 
but by draughts. When there is a great confufion and dejec- 
tion of fpirits, Witters may be laid to the neck, back part of 
the head, or behind the ears. Whatever fymptoms appear, 
for this difeafe will put on various fhapes, avoid bleeding when 
the pulfe is fmail, quick, and unequal, which is always the 
cafe in this fever. When the breathing is thick and laborious, 
with fighing or fobbing, ti en give the following bolus : 
*' Take compound powder of contrayerva, fifteen grains; of 
" faffrqn, three grains; of confection alkermes, enough to 
-' to make a bolus." After which, the following draught 
muft be drank : " Take half an ounce of the juice of lemons, 
" twenty grains of fait of wormwood j then add an ounce 
" and a half of Ample alexiteriai v/ater, a dram and a half of 
* c compound lavender water, and as much of fyrupof faffron, 
" as alfo, a dram of fine loaf fugar ; m::c them." When 
vaft tremblings come on, and touching of the tendons, in-> 
ftead of the bolus, give ten or fifjeen grains of mufk, which 
may be repeated every fifth, fixth, or eighth hour. Like- 
\vife, lay a blifler to the thigha, legs, and arms. Be fure

member, to indulge the patient with any fort of wine he lihs left. 
Towards the decline of the fever, when the fweats are copious 
and weakening, you may give the following tin&ure of the 
bark, every fourth, fmh, or eighth hour : " Take two ounces 
*' of Peruvian bark, an ounce and a half of the yellow part 
" of orange-peel, three drams of Virginian fnake-root, four 
" fcruples of faffron, two fcruples of cochineal, and a pint 
" and a gill of French brandy ; put them into a bottle, cork 
" it up, and let them ftand for fome days." When there is 
an evident intermiffion, other preparations of the bark may be 
given, with half an ounce of the fyrup of lemons, and twen- 
ty grains of fait of wormwood. A dofe of ''lubarb now and 
then will carry the putrid humours downward. 

FEVER PUTRID, MALIGNANT, SPOTTED. 

The fever makes its attack with fudden lofs of ftrenoth, in- 
fomuch that the patient can hardly walk or ftand upright, and 
is apt to faint. The head aches from the very beginning, and 
is hot and dull, with lownefs of fpirtts, and a kind of defpair. 
The patient has little or no fleep, at leaft that is refrefhing. The 
appetite is loft, the countenance deje&ed, the pulfe is weak, 
fmall, and unequal. The patient lies in bed in a diforderly 
manner. There is an oppreffion of the breaft, fometimes with 
a dry cough. There is an undulatory and tremulous twitching 
of the fibres of the mufcles and tendons ; as alfo, a leaping 
or twitching of the tendons themfelves. However, fome are 
infenfible of all other fymptoms but weaknefs and want of fleep. 
-On the fourth, fifth, and feventh day, the fpots appear on the 
back and loins of various colours, generally without relief, be- 
ing rather fymptomatical than critical. 

In the cure, a full quick tenfe pulfe indicates moderate 
bleeding, which muft never be repeated. Befides, takin away 
a large quantity at firft is % generally fatal. If the head only 
.fuffers, it will be fafeft to take blood away from the temples 
with leeches. When there is a delirium, with a funk pulfe, 
bleeding is pernicious. Many have recovered without bleeding, 
but few or none that have loft much blood. Vomits at the be- 
.ginning may nip the difeafe in the bud. When the fever is 
fixed, and vomiting comes on of itfelf, it may be then dange- 
rous to give one. But fome draughts of camomile tea may 
be allowed, and the juice of lemons with fait of wormwood, 
mentioned in the nervous fever, and three quarters of an 
ounce of lyrup of white poppies, may be all given to allay

the commotions j but the common ufe of opiates is dan- 
gerous. 

Coftiveriefs may be removed by laxative emollient clyfters, 
and will be proper at any time of the fever, when there is a 
naufeous bittemefs in the mouth, ficknefs at the ftomach, with 
belchings that have a ftrong fmell. The next care is to promote 
a breathing fweat, which muft be done by mild means : '* Take 
" of contrayerva root, ten grains ; of nitre, fix grains; of 
" camphire, three grains ; make a powder." This may be 
taken every third hour. But the moft certain remedy to pro- 
cure a fweat, is half an ounce of thefpirit of Mindererus. If 
the patient can be brought to a thorough fweat with a fifing 
pulfe, it may prove critical ; but it muft never be forced : when 
it is too profufe in the beginning, it muft be checked. 

If nature endeavours to relieve herfelf by vomit, between the 
feventh and fourteenth day, or by loofe ftools, a gentle laxative 
of manna, or cream of tartar may be proper, unlefs the ap- 
pearance of an eruption, or a kindly fweat forbid it. When 
the loofenefs is too profufe, it may be checked with red wine 
mulled with cinnamon, or an aftringent clyfler with diafcor- 
dium : but it is very dangerous to fupprefs a critical loofenefs 
too foon, efpecially as the difeafe is often carried off that way. 
It certainly promotes health, when the fever is part the height, 
when there is a gentle breathing fweat, or a warm moifture of 
the fkin. When the pulfe finks with a loofenefs, fome drops 
of liquid laudanum may be added to other medicines. 

When the pulfe finks and the ftupor jncreafes, at which time 
the fpots commonly appear, the general remedies are an alexi- 
pharmac decoclion, a cordial mixture, or wine given alternate- 
ly, and the patient muft never be two hours without drinking 
fome of them. The alexipharmac decoiSHon is thus made : 
" Take Virginian fnake-root bruifed, and the Peruvian bark 
" in powder, of each three drams ; boil them in a pint of wa- 
" ter to one half, ftrain off the liquor, and then add an ounce 
*' and a half of fpirituous cinnamon water, and a quarter of 
" an ounce of fyrup of cloves." The dofe is four fpoonfuls 
every fourth or fixth hour. This will keep the patient from 
finking under the difeafe, and, when the fever is gone, will be 
a prefervative againft a relapfe. The fnake-root alone may be 
given as foon as the pulfe begins to fail ; but the bark is not to 
be added till the decline of the difeafe. The patient may like- 
wife be indulged in the free ufe of wine, which alone is a high 
cordial. Some think generous red wine the beft. But if the 

de-

delirium increafes on ufing wine, if the eyes look wild, or the 
voice becomes quick, a true phrenzy is to be feared ; then all 
heating medicines aggravate the fymptoms, and blifters, before 
ufelefs, become of confiderable fervice ; likewife when the pulfe 
moft funk, finapifms muft be laid to the feet ; that is, pul- 
tices with horfe-radifh, or muftard feed with fait and vinegar. 
The patient muft not be allowed to fit up, becaufe many have 
loft their lives by attempting it. 

FEVER, BURNING. This is known by the burning heat 
of the flcin, which is moft remarkable about the heart. The 
breath is extremely hot, with a drynefs of the whole Ikin, no- 
fhils, mouth and tongue. The breathing is thick, difficult 
and quick ; the tongue is yellow or black, parched and rough. 
The thirft is unquenchable, with a loathing of food, a nau- 
fea, and a vomiting But this fever is uncommon in this 
climate. 

The cure requires pure cool air, frequently renewed, and 
after bleeding, he muft drink plentifully of foft, tartHb, watry 
warm liquor, and receive the fteams of warm water into 
the mouth. When there is a coftivenef?, it requires foft, dilut- 
ing, laxative clyfters. A dram of pure nitre, diflblved in a 
a quart of whey, may be given for drink. No medicines 
{hould be given that promote fweat by their acrimony, but 
their plenty, fuchas thole juft mentioned. They may be made 
gratefully acid with tamarinds, which will tend to keep the 
body open. There is a BURNING BILIOUS FEVRR of the 
IVefi-lndie^ commonly called the YELLOW FEVER. It 
has fome fymptoms in common with the former ; but may be 
readily known by the faft'ron colour of the eyes, twelve hours 
after the attack. There has been no certain remedy yet found 
out to cure this difeafe, but Dr. James's FEVER POWDER. 

FEVER, HECTIC. A continual heat attends this fever, 
xvith a hard, quick, weak pulfe, which fymptoms increafe af- 
ter eating, and towards evening. The fkin and tongue are 
hard and dry, the cheeks red, the whole body is weak and 
flabby, the fleep without refrefhment, the urine red with a 
fediment, and a blue fatty fkin on the top. The whole body 
falls away, fo that the bones ftick out every where. 

There is a fever not unlike this called a SLOW FEVER, 
which has milder fymptoms, a gentler heat, with profufe 
fweats after fleeping ; after whic Si, and before noon, the pulfe 
is natural. The Ikin is not fo dry, and urine not fo dark co- 
loured. The c.mfe of this is in the fluids, buc the hectic in

the folids, proceeding from a corruption of fome one of the 

bowels ; whence it feldom or never admits of a cure. 

When a flow fever proceeds from crudities, a vomit will 
be proper, and then give vitriolated tartar to incide and 
carry the humours downward ; afterwards a little rhubarb, and 
thefe muft be given when the fever is off. And indeed, this 
]aft is an effectual remedy againft all flow fevers, unlefs they 
depend on other difeafes, and then regard muft be principally 
had to them. When it proceeds from a great lofs of blood, or 
any of the neceflary fluids of the body, it requires reft both of 
b.;dy and mind ; alight temperate diet, and fuch medicines as 
allay heat, and at the fame time revive the fpirits ; fuch as affes 
milk, chicken broth, craw-fifh-foop, oifters, and other fhell- 
rim ; together v\ un wine mixt with water. In a HeBic Fever, 
the only refuge is a milk diet, with frequent riding. If afles 
milk cannot be had, let the patient drink the milk of a cow 
at grafs in a morning ; that is, a pint mixt with an ounce of 
manna, or fugar of rofes, or conferve of rofes. After this 
let him drink a quart a day, difiblving in it half an ounce of 
fugar, and half a dram of nitre. No wine muft be allowed, 
but a little mead for the ftomach's fake. Likewife, he may 
take fmall dofcs of the bark made into an ele&ary, with fy- 
rup of lemon juice. 

FEVER, MILK. The milk-fever happens on the third or 
fourth day from the delivery, and arifes from the plentiful 
flow of milk into the breafts. Sometimes there is a fwelling 
in the breafts, which reaches as far as the arm-pits, where the 
pain is commonly violent. It generally continues a day or two, 
and ends by the benefit of nature, in a plentiful fweat. The 
child fnould be put often to the breafts ; but if fhe does not 
intend to give fuck, they fhould be drawn by a proper perfon. 
When the pain is great, the lochia will flop, but flow again 
as foon as it is over. To prevent the curdling of the milk, 
warm linfeed oil, or oil of fweet almonds, may be ufed to keep 
the breafts fupple, rubbing fome upon them with a warm hand. 
If the fever (hould happen to be very acute and hot, threaten- 
ing an inflammation of the breafts, it will be proper to bleed. 
Women generally put double cloths dipt in brandy under the 
arm- pits, to drive back the milk. 

FEVER, SCARLET. This chiefly attacks children, and 

begins with a coldnefs and fhivering, without any violent 

ficknefs. Afterwards the fkin is covered with red fpots, which 

are larger, more florid, and not fo uniform as the meafles.

FAMILY PHYSICIAN." 51 

The rednefs remains two or three days, and then difappears. 
The cuticle falls < ff, leaving mealy -fcales behind them. In the 
cure, let the patient abftain from flefh, hot cordials, and fpiri- 
tuous liquors; keep him within, but not confined conftantiy to 
his bed, and then medicines will be of little ufe. But if the 
patient has convulfion fits about the beginning of the dif- 
eafe, or is very fieepy, it will be necefTary to lay a large blifter- 
ingpla'ier to the hind part of the neck, and to give a little 
fyrupof white poppies every night till he is well. His drink 
muft be milk mixt with thrice the quantity of water. After 
it is over, give him a gentle purge. 

FRENCH DISEASE. When a man or woman has had 
the difeafe common called a clap, the cure of which has been 
neglected, or not properly managed, then it rifes to the degree 
called the French pox. This isrirft known by a fwelling like 
boils in the groin, called buboes. Thefe are followed with 
pains, which cruelly afflicl: the head, joints of the {houlders, 
arms, and anclc-s. They are felt moft in the night when the 
patient is warm in bed, and feldom leave him till towards 
morning. Likewife, fcurf and fcabs appear in various parts 
of the body, which are as yellow as a honey-comb ; fometimes 
they are very broad, but the more they are difperfed over the 
body, the lefs is the torment. All thefe fymptoms increafe by 
.degrees, efpecially the pain, which becomes fo intenfe, that the 
patient is not able to lie in bed. Afterwards nodes or knots 
arife in the fkull, fljin-bones, and bones of the arms, which 
being attended with conftant pain and inflammation, they at 
length corrupt and grow rotten. Eating ulcers likewife feize 
various parts of the body, beginning firft at the throat, and 
from thence creep by degrees to the palate, to the griftle of 
the nofe, which being confumed, |he nofe falls down flat. 

The cure has generally been attempted by falivation, but 
that is more hazardous, and lefs effectual than taking quickfi!- 
ver pills: " Take two drams of quickfilver, and grind it in 
*' a mortar, with turpentine enough to kill it, and then add 
*< thirty grains of coloquintida pills, with aloes; mix them 
together, and make twelve pills." One of thefe pills taken 
night and morning, will keep the body open without gripes or 
ficknefs. If they mould make the mouth fore, they muft be left 
off" immediately, and not be taken again till it is gone. They 
muft be repeated till all the fymptoms are gone. If the pa- 
tient at night takes half a pint of the following decodion, as 
'hot as he can, and fweats after it, it will haften the cure. 

D 2 " Take 



52 'Tie FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

" Take four ounces of the rafpings of guaiacum, and boil 
*' them in a gallon of water to two quarts." When there is 
knots in the bones, lay fome of the following plafter over 
them: " Take of factitious cinnabar, two ounces ; of yellow 
*' bees wax, half a pound; oil of rofes, two ounces; melt 
" them together for a plafter." This will difperfethem miracu- 
loufly. A little of the blue ointment may be rub'd into the 
buboes once a day, before they begin to ripen, which will dif- 
perfe them. When the cure goes on fuccefsfully, all other 
fymptoms will vanifh of courfe. 

GALLING in Children. Sometimes the fharpnefs of the 
urine will fret off the outward fkin near the private parts ; as 
will fweating in the wrinkles of the neck, under the arms, and 
in other places. To remedy this, the parts muft firft be wafhed 
in warm water, and then put the fine powder of cerufs in a rag, 
and fliake a little of it out upon the place. When the parts 
are very fore, diflblve thirty grains of white vitriol in half a 
pint of water, and dab a little of it on the fore place with a 
rag. 

GONORRHEA VIRULENT, or a CLAP. There are 
many fyrnptoms by which this difeafe may be known, but I 
(hall pafs them over, becaufe if either fex have a heat or 
fmarting in making water, with a running that colours their 
linen yellow or green, they may certainly conclude they are 
infected. This may fometimes be received from a hufband or 
wife, and the innocent party may not know what is the matter, 
till they are far gone. In men, the urine feems to burn as it 
were the urinary pafTage ; but women complain more of a 
difficulty of making water. 

The cure muft be begun with the following pills : " Take 
* c of quickfilver, two drams ; of gum guaiacum, a dram ; 
" grind this and the quickfilver together, with a little fyrup of 
" lemons, till it difappears ; then add of the coloquintida pill, 
" with aloes, half a dram, and beat them into a mafs, out of 
" which make twenty-four pills." Two of thefe are to be 
taken night and morning, for a week or ten days, unlefs the 
patient's mouth begins to be fore, for then the quickfilver muft 
be left out. If they purge too much, one pill may be taken 
inftead of two. When the penis is bent downward by the 
contraction of the bridle, and continues fo, give twenty grains 
of nitre with as much fugar, in a draught of the following 
mixture now and then : " Take a quart of mercurial water, 
" and mix it with an ounce of the folution of gum arabic, and 

an

Cc and an ounce of fyrup of marfh- mallows." The mercu- 
rial water is thus made : " Take four ounces of quickfilver, 
" and boil it in two quarts of foft water to a quart." The 
patient may diink this through the whole courfe. After this, 
the pills may be given for ten days more at night only, and 
the quantity of a nutmeg of the following eled'tary in the 
morning: " Take of virgin honey, an ounce and a half; of 
" balfam capivi, fix drams ; powdered jalap and falt-petre, of 
" each a dram ; make them into an eledtary." The patient 
muft drink a draught of the mixture, both after the pill, and 
after the eledluary. When the running grows lefs, more 
white and more clammy, the electuary only muft be taken 
night and morning fome days longer. If it purges too much, 
put rhubarb in the room of jalap. If the running will not flop 
by thefe means, give half a dram of boiled turpentine, three 
times a day, made up into pills. When this method is obferved 
carefully, the patient may be cured in about three weeks. 

GOUT FLYING. This is improperly called by fome the 
fcorbutic rbeumatifm, and may generally be diftinguifhed by the 
patient's urine ; for a kind of filaments or threads may be feen 
to float in it, which are not quite fo tranfparent as the urine it- 
felf, but when taken out they will appear as pellucid ascryftal, 
will rope to a great length, and when dry'd will turn white. 
This is the morbific matter of the gravel, gout, hip-gout, and 
all fuch kind of pains diftint from the rheumatifm. To cure 
this diforder, nothing is more certain than Spanifh foap ; of 
which, from half an ounce to an ounce muft be taken in a 
day for a month together. 

GOUT. This difeafe is well known, and needs nodefcrip- 

tion. The beft cure for it is the duke of Portland's powder, 

which is now fold in moft apothecaries {hops in London. A 

dram of this is to be taken every morning for three months, in 

a cup of wine, water, broth, or tea. Then three quarters of a 

ram for three months longer, and half a dram every morning for 

.x months more, fafting an hour and a half after each dofe. Af- 

er the firft year, it will be fufficient to take half a dram every 

ther day. The patient muft not be difcouraged if he perceives 

no great amendment at firft. It works flow, but fure, and it 

may be fometimes two years before he receives any benefit. A 

ram of flower of brimftone taken every morning in a fpoon- 

ul of milk, has prevented the gout for many years. 

GRAVEL, a fit of. This is attended with a fixt pain in the

ftones, a numbnefs of the thigh on the fide of the part affe&ed, 
a naufea and vomiting. When the ftone is fallen into the 
bladder, the urine becomes thick, turbid, of the colour of cof- 
fee, and is mere plentiful than before. The chief intention of 
cure, is to make the ftone pafs eafily from the kidney to the 
bladder, which may be beft done by the fol'owing medicine : 
" Take of Alicant or Caftile foap, four ounces ; of double 
" refined fugar, two ounces; of fine fall ad oil, an ounce; of 
" oil of annifeeds, forty drops ; mix them." A dram of this 
made into pills muft be taken every two hours during the fit. 
When there is a vomiting, mix twenty grains of fait of worm- 
wood with a fpoonful of juice of lemons, and give the patient. 
]f the pain is very violent, then bleed, and diflblve four grains 
of opium in fix ounces of the common deco&ion, and give it 
as a dyfter. Or you may make a bath of camomile flowers, 
roots of marfh-mallows, and hnfeed oil, and let the patient fit 
in it. This will often put an end to the pain, when bleeding 
and opiates have had no effect. When the roots are wanting 
ufe the leaves. 

GREEN-SICKNESS. When a girl is affixed with this 
this difeafe, her complexion at firft is pale and wan, which af- 
ter a while becomes greenim or more dark, and there is a red 
or dark circle appears under the eyes. The whole body is hea- 
vy and dull. The feet feem unapt for motion, with a difficulty 
of breathing, palpitation of the heart, a pain in the head, a 
defire of eating coals, chalk, &c. At length the face is bloat- 
ed, and the ancles and eye-lids become fwelled. The intention 
of cure is to keep the body open, to warm the blood, to dif- 
folve the fizy humours, and to open the obftructed veffels. All 
which may be efFe&ed by the following eleclary : " Take of 
" Caftile or Alicant foap, three ounces ; powder of rhubarb, 
" fpecies of hiera picra, and filings of fteel, of each half 
" an cunce ; of fyrup of orange peel, enough to make an 
" clecbry." The dofe is forty grains, twice a day. The 
patient's drink fhould be fpaw-water, or any other chal\ beat 
water, or a fpoonful of the fteel wine, or two fpoonfuls of the 
bitter wine. Jf the above eleclary fhould be too purgative, . 
fubftitute the following : " Take of the Peruvian bark, half an 
* c ounce; of the compound powder of crabs claws, half an ounce; 
tc of the filings of fteel, t*o drams and a half; of fait of 
*' wormwood, two fcrup'es ; make thefe into an eleclary 
" with fyrup of orange peel." The dofe is the quantity of 
a nutmeg twice a day. Or, take feven grains of the filings of 

iteel, 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 55 

fieel, and make them into three pills, with the extract of worm- 
wood, for one dofe, which muft be taken early in the morning, 
and at five in the afternoon, for thirty days together. HOOP- 
ER's PILLS, fo'd by Mr. Newbery in 'St. Paul's church-yard, 
London, have had very good effects in the cure of this difeafe, 
and is perhaps the beft medicine yet difcovered for this pur- 
pofe. 

GUMS LAX and apt to BLEED. To cure this diforder 
make ufe of the following gargle. " Take of oak-bark an 
*' ounce, of fpring water a pint and a half ; boil them to a 
" pint, and then add of roch alum a dram, of honey of ro- 
" fes an ounce; mix them ;" and gargle the mouth with it 
pretty often. 

HE ART- BURN. This is a pain about the pit of the flo- 
mach, often attended with anxiety, a naufea, reaching to vo- 
mit, and fometimes actual vomiting ; it generally proceeds 
from fharp four humours, gnawing icme part of the ftomach. 
A common heart-burning that happens in a morning, may be 
generally cured by drinking tea or coffee, or a decoclion of 
camomile flowers, or a dram of orange peel in a glafs of wine, 
made pretty hot and fweetened with fugar ; likewife crabs 
claws prepared, or chalk, or any other abforbent powder is good 
to correct the acrimonious humours of the ftomach ; as alfo 
the lozenges, for the heart-burn, of the mops, which may be 
carried in the pocket and eaten at pleafure : or, " take of pre- 
" pared chalk half an ounce, of gum arabic twenty five 
" grains, of white fugar an ounce, and pour on boiling hot 
" water a quart ; then add of fpirituous cinnamon water half 
* c an ounce ; mix them." This may be drank at pleafure. 
When the heart-burn proceeds from a plentiful meal, give a 
gentle vomit; if the vomiting is begun, you muft afiift it with 
large draughts of carduus tea or warm water. 

HIP-GOUT, or SCIATICA, is a violent and obftinate 
pain in the hip, chiefly in the joint, wheie the head of the 
thigh-bone is inferted into its focket : the pain will fometimes 
reach as far as the lower part of the loins, to the thigh and leg, 
and yet no change of colour in the fkin is to be feen outwardly. 
In the cure the patient muft be purged twice a week, for fix 
times, with twenty or thirty grains of rhubarb, and ten grains of 
calomel, made up into a bolus with conferve of mallow flow- 
ers : after this is over, " boil the rafpings or fhavings of guai- 
" acum, of the bark and wood of faflafras, and of raifins 
" ftoned, each a quarter of a pound, in a fufficient quantity of 

D 4 ** water, 



56 The FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

" water, for ten hours, to a gallon ;" this muft be for common 
cirink : then take the following bolus every night. *' Take of 
" cinnabar a fcruple, of gum guaiacum and camphire each 
" five grains, of volatile fait of amber four grains, of con- 
" ferve of wood forrel half a dram, make them into a bolus 
" with fyrup of balfam ;" this muft be continued five or fix 
vceks. Some put the faponaceous Jiniment or opodeldoc upon 
the part, others apply cupping glafles, and others a cauftic 
made vviih a mixture of quick lime and foft foap ; but the beft 
and fureft way ot curing this difeafe, may be feen in the flying 
gout. 

HYPOCHONDRIAC PASSION. This difeafe is at- 
tended with tenfions and windy inflations of the ftomach 
and inteftines, elpecially under the fpurious ribs on the left 
fide, in which a pretty hard tumour may fometimes be per- 
ceived ; befides, there are fuch a large train of fymptoms, it 
would be a hard tafk to relate them all. There is commonly 
a coitivenefs of the body, with an uneafmefs of the mind, 
which renders the patient diftruftful, morofe, fad or melan- 
choly, with loathing of food, wringing pains of the inteftines, 
and various diforders of the head j in fhort, it imitates all dif- 
eafes, and can be known by no fymptom more certainly, than 
a defbair of recovery. The cure muft be begun with laxatives 
or gentle purges, to cleanfe the firft paflages, fuch as manna, 
rhubarb, tinftura facra^ or Epfom fait ; or the patient may 
take the following pill. " Take fuccotrine aloes and Spanifh. 
" foap of each equal parts, of thin honey enough to make 
*' them into pills." The dofe is half a dram over night, or 
early in the morning : all forts of good bitters will be proper 
to flrengthen the ftomach, as alfo the fteel medicines mentioned 
under the green ficknefs : or, " Take of filings of fteel fix 
** drams, of candied ginger an ounce, of conferve of orange- 
" peel three ounces, of fyrup of orange peel enough to 
" make an electary." The dofe is the quantity of a fmall 
\valnutthree times a day ; likewife the following ele&ary is a 
great ftrengthener : " Take of Peruvian bark an ounce and a 
" half, of filings of fteei or colcothar of vitriol three drams, 
" of fyrup of orange-peel enough to make an electary." The 
dofe is the quantity of a nutmeg thrice a day. Sometimes it 
will be proper to bleed in the foot ; or if the bleeeding piles 
have been ftopt, leeches fhould be applied to the part affected, 
as of; en as the patient is troubled with a pain of the loins, or 
;:ear the place from whence the eruption proceeded : in tie fit-,

FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 57 

the patient mould put his feet pretty deep in a warm deco&ion 
of wheat-bran and camomile-flowers, and the body, if coftive, 
Ihould be opened with clyfters. 

HYSTERIC PASSION. This is a diforder proceeding 
from the womb, when there is corrupted blood or ferum re- 
tained therein ; an hyfteric fit is preceded with a preffing pain 
of the forehead, temples or eyes, an effufion of tears, a dim- 
jiefs of fight, and a dulnefs of the mind and fenfes ; the pa- 
tient in the fit is exceeding coftive, and has a ftrong defire to 
make water, which is thin and clear. The whoie body is lan- 
guid, with a difficulty of breathing, a pain in the loins, and a 
(hivering or making ; the belly is hard, and the navel is drawn 
inwards, the heart flutters, the extremities are cold, and the 
parts about the throat feem ftrait as if bound with a cord. 
Some have ftrong convulfions of the head and limbs, others 
have their face and neck look red and inflamed, others again 
break out into fits of laughter, and utter many abfurd things. 
The patients may generally be brought to their fenfes by burn- 
ing feathers or the like under their nofe ; with afTa-foetida, or 
preparations of caftor. For women in child-bed, a girdle 
made of Ruffia-leather, and bound pretty tight, is excellent ; 
likewife clyfters made with camomile-flowers, elder-flowers, 
and male fpeedwel, boiled in whey, to which add a little oil 
of elder. 

Inwardly give twenty grains of the following pills : " Take 
" of gum-ammoniac two drams, of Ruffian caftor a dram, of 
" fait of amber thirty grains, balfam of Peru, enough to make 
* c a mafs for pills." 

Out of the fit, if the patient is full of blood, it will be 
proper to take fome away, unlefs the fits come on at particular 
times of the moon, as the full or new, or at the quarters ; 
then take four grains of the mafs of gum-pills, and make them 
into two pills for a dofe ; this quantity is to be taken every two 
hours. Sometimes it will be proper to lay the following plafter 
to the navel : " Take of galbanum, diflblved in tincture of 
" caftor and ftrained, three drams, of tacamahac three drams ; 
64 mix them, and make a plafter to be applied to the navel." 
If the fits obferve the changes of the moon, then, * take of 
'" wild valerian-root half a dram, of nitre or factitious cinna- 
" bar in fine powder twenty grains, mix and make a powder," 
to be taken morning and evening in a fpoonful of fyrup of 
fugar,

It is neceffary to obferve that all women cannot bear the 
fame medicines: fome have an averlion to all medicines with a 
flrong fmell, which are an immediate relief to others ; fome 
have been brought to themfelves by fprinkl ng cold water on the 
face, when more powerfui fpiri.uous medicines have failed ; 
otheis cannot endure hot things either outwardly or inwardly, 
fuch as baths, fomentations, liniments and nervous applicati- 
ons. Anodynes and opiates, which give eafe and reft to fome, 
are very injurious to thofe of weak nerves, or who are greatly 
debilitated. 

A fcruple of the Peruvian bark, given morning and evening, 
is an excellent remedy in hyfteric convulfions. 

JAUNDICE. This difeafe is firft difcovered by a yellow 
tinclure of the fkin, but more efpecially in the coats of the 
eyes, where it gives notice of the invafion j it is attended with 
a wearinefs of the whole body, uneafmefs in the right fide, 
ficknefs at the ftomach, oppreflion in the breaft, difficulty of 
breathing, a dry harfh fkin, cofHvenefs, hard white ftools, 
and yellow high coloureJ urine, which colours linen like faf- 
fron. In the cure, firft give a vomit with a fcruple of ipeca- 
cuanha, and a grain of emetic tartar ; the next night, give 
half a dram of the following pills : " Take foccotrine-aloes 
" and Caftile foap of each equal parts, of thin honey enough 
" to make them into pills." Two or three dofts of this 
may be given every other day; then give half a dram 
of the following pills twice or thrice a day. " Take of 
" Caftile foap three drams, of hog-lice prepared a dram ; 
" make them into pills with fyrup of faffron :" or if an 
eleclary is liked better, " take of Caftile foap three ounces, of 
** rhubarb in powder half an ounce, of the fpecies of hiera 
*' picra half an ounce, of fyrup of orange-peel enough to 
ct make an eleclary." After fome time, it will be proper to 
add half an ounce of the filings of fteel ; the dofe is half a 
dram twice a day : but if this fhould keep the body too open, 
then " take of the conferve of orange-peel two ounces, of 
41 Caftile foap an ounce and a half, of prepared cinnabar and 
" hog-lice each half an ounce, of faffron in powder half a 
u dram, of the fyrup of orange peel enough to make an 
" ele&ary." The dofe is the quantity of a nutmeg thrice a

evident reafon. If this method fails, fend the patient to 
Tunbridge to drink the waters. 

ILIAC PASSION. This difeafe begins wr.h coftivenefs, 
which is followed with {harp and violent pains ; as alf > a fwell- 
ing about the navel, which feels hard to the touch ; the body is 
fo bound, that neither wind nor excrements can pafs down- 
wards : the wind tirft makes its way upwards, then comes on 
ftcknefs and frequent vomiting of phlegm and yellow mat- 
ter; whatever is eat or drank is foon thrown up again, then 
the matter begins to be red, with a ftinking fmell, which is 
fuppofed to be the excrements. This is fucceeded by lofs of 
ftrength, a preternatural heat, a hard narrow pulfe, with great 
thirft, the urine is red, and made with difficulty. 

In the cure bleed immediately, and repeat it once or twice if 
there is occafion, then apply a blifter where the pain lies,j this 
done, give twenty grains of the cathartic extract, with one 
grain of the Thebaic extract : when there is an inflammation, 
give feven grains of purified nitre, with half a grain of cam- 
phire diffolved in any finall liquor. If the blifter does not re- 
lieve the patient, mix a dram of camphire with an ounce of 
hogs-lard, and anoint the belly therewith. As one chief in- 
tention is to procure ftools, the patient may be led backward 
and forward over a cold floor, with the legs, feet and thighs 
naked ; then dafh cold water on the feet, afterwards the legs, 
and then the thighs, which will procure the intended effect 
wonderfully ; or a pound of quick-filver may be given before 
the cafe is defperate and not after, other wife it will be faid that 
the quick-filver killed the patient. 

INFLAMMATION of the INTESTINES. When this 
happens, nothing will pafs through the body, and there is a 
violent fixt burning pain in fome part of the belly, which is 
exafperated by taking any thing inwardly. When the inflam- 
mation is in the upper part of the guts, the ftomach will be 
diftended with wind, and will produce vomiting, which will 
turn to the Iliac pajfion. Obferve likewife that there is a quick 
pulfe, a lofs of ftrength, an inquietude, and an unufual heat 
throughout the whole body : when the pain is about the navel, 
the fmall guts are certainly in fault. The cure muft be be- 
gun with bleeding, and the only nourishment fhould be broth ; 
alfo the patient may take a clyfter with river water and fyrup 
of marfh mallows : purges rtnder the difeafe worfe, as well as 
fharp clyfters. But in all internal inflammations whatever, 
the beft method is to lay a Wider, after bleeding, as near the 

part

part affected as pofHble ; nor is there any danger of a miftake, 
for they \vill anfwer equally, whether the pain proceeds from 
an inflammation or from wind. 

INFLAMMATION of the EYE. This may be eafily 
perceived ; for, betides a pricking pain, the vefTels of the white 
of the eye are turgid with blood, whence an unufual rednefs 
appears ail over that part. In this cafe, the patient muft ab- 
itain from all heating things, tobacco and frmff; the light muft 
not be flrong nor the room fmoaky, the drink may be water 
alone, or a decolion of fennel feeds, hartfhorn and barley. 
The flighter inflammations from the duft or fun, may be cured 
by fomenting them with milk or water, and anointing the 
eyes with ointment of tutty at night. If the eyes are weak, 
and but little inflamed, they may be wafhed with brandy and 
water. Sometimes moats or the hairs of the eye-lids growing 
inwards, will caufe this inflammation ; therefore the eyes 
fhould be carefully examined, that thefe caufes may be removed. 
The (lighter cafes may be cured without bleeding; but when 
there is a fever or a confiderable inflammation, the patient muft 
be bled freely in the arm or jugular ; however, laying blifters 
behind the ears will fometimes do alone, efpecially if they are 
kept running two or three days : or rather fix two leeches to 
the lower part of the orbit of the eye, or near the outward 
corner ; the wound muft be fuffered to ooze for fome hours 
after they are fallen ofF. In all great inflammations, this me- 
thod muft be ufed after bleeding, bliftering and purging; 
when the inflammation gives way a little to evacuations, the 
alum curd fpread on lint may be laid to the eye at bed-time, 
for it is the beft external remedy. When this difeafe proceeds 
from 2 venereal taint, or from the king's evil, this method 
will fail. 

ITCH. The milder fort of this difeafe appears firft about 
the hams and other joints, and from thence fpreads by degrees 
all over the body, the head only excepted. The moift itch is 
attended with pimples full of purulent matter, with a. flight 
inflammation, which is known from their rednefs before they 
break. The dry kind afHi&s thofe that are lean, old, and of a 
melancholy conftitution : the pimples or puftules are moft nu- 
merous between the fingers, and on the hams, thighs and 
arms. When the itch is frefh caught, it may be fafely cured 
by the following ointment: " Take of pomatum half a pound, 
" of flower of brimftone two ounces, of the eflence of le- 
" pions twenty drops ; mix and make an ointment." Part of 

this 



The FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 61 

this muft be rubbed into the joints, arms and thighs, every 
night at bed-time. When the difeafe is obftinate, it will be 
proper to give a purge with mercury thus : " Take of colo- 
" quintida pills with aloes half a dram, of calomel ten grains, 
" mix, and make five pills for one dofe." When the working 
is over, give five of the following pills thrice a day : " Take 
" Ethiops mineral half an ounce, calx of antimony a dram, 
lc of conferve of hips enough to make them into pills, ten 
" out of every dram." After the third day, the purge may 
be repeated if neceflary, and then the other pills. When the 
cafe is very ftubborn, take calomel and the golden fulphur 
of antimony of each five grains, of foccotrine aloes fifteen 
grains, and fyrup of balfam, make them into pills for five 
dofes, to be taken morning and evening. At night the fol- 
lowing liniment may be rubbed into the parts abovementioned : 
" Take of hogs lard two ounces, of white mercury precipitate 
" a dram, mix them." The diet muft be {lender, and all 
falted meats and hot fpicy things mufl be avoided. 

KING'S EVIL. This is known from the fwelling of the 
kernels in the neck, which rife by degrees, and are generally 
without pain ; they likewife appear under the chin, in the 
armpits, groin and hams, but moft commonly in the neck, 
and below the ears. This difeafe will caufe inflammations in 
the eyes, and a rednefs and puffing up of the edges of the eye- 
lids, as alfo a flux of tears and other matter from the greater 
corner of the eye ; fometimes the upper lip will appear thick 
and fwelled, and there will be a crufty foul ulcer in thenofe. 

The cure of this difeafe requires the moft powerful remedies, 
which muft be perfifted in a long while. " Take of burnt 
" fpunge a fcruple, purified nitre, coraline and white fugar 
" of each ten grains, mix and make a powder." This is to 
be taken twice a day, drinking a large draught of fhell lime- 
water after it : or rather let lime-water be the conftant drink. 
He muft abftain from falted meats and high feafoned dier, 
eating things eafy of digeftion : or, " Take mercurius dulcis 
" and the golden fulphur of antimony of each five grains, of 
" foccotrine aloes fifteen grains, of fyrup of balfam enough 
" to make a mafs, out of which make five pills j" give one 
morning and evening : they will hardly make the mouth foie, 
but if they mould, leave them oft" for a while. Or, " Take 
" of Ethiops mineral two ounces, of hog-lice prepared two 
<l drams and a half, of fponge prepared two drams, of preci- 
*' pitated fulphur two drams, of conferve of mallow flowers fix 

drams, 



62 Tie FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

" drams, of folutive fyrup of rofes enough to make an eleft- 
ary;" the dofe is the fize of a nutmeg morning and evening, 
drinking a pint of fea- water after every morning dofe. 

KIBES or CHILBLAINS. In this diforder whi'e the (kin 
continues whole, and is only diftended with a troublefome in- 
flammation and itching, it will be proper to rub the part with 
fnow or co'd water, and to avoid coming near the fire as much 
as poffible : for as this difeafe isoccafioned by cold, the fire will 
be hurtful, as in all other cafes proceeding from exceffive 
.cold. After the fnow, the part may be rubbed with campho- 
rated fpirit of wine, and then the patient may be put tc be i, 
and be made to fweat with internal medicines. When the 
chilblain tends to break and fuppurate, it may be treated with 
Peruvian balfam, or tin&ure of myrrh and aloes, which will 
deterge and heal them, applying a compref5, dipt in a mixture 
of lime-water and camphorated fpirit of wine; but if itfhould 
turn to a gangrene or fphacelus, a fuppuration muftbe procured, 
or an amputation made : the gangrene mud be fcarified to the 
quick, and treated with warm fomentations or poultices, as in 
burns, to feparate the corrupted part from the living. 1 But in 
all fuch cafes the afliftance of an experienced furgeon muft be 
called in. 

LAXATIVES. Of which manna, caffia and raifins are 
moft proper for difeafes of the breaft, coughs, fpitting of blood, 
pleurefy and confumption ; as alfo indiforders from a fait, acrid 
and fcorbutic ferum, as in pains of the joints, eruptions on 
the fkin, and rheumatifms, becaufe they not only cleanfe the 
belly, but temperate and correct the faline acrimony. Tama- 
rinds, cream of tartar, fal polychreftum, and ftibiated nitre, 
agree beft with hot climates, bilious conftitutions, in the heat 
of fummer, bilious difeafes, attended with a violent heat, as 
in a continual double fummer tertian, a burning fever, with 
intolerable thirft, becaufe they reftrain the inteftine motion of 
the fulphureous parts of the blood and bile. 

In the cachexy and all chronic difeafes, attended with a thick - 
nefs of the fluids, the bitter laxatives are beft, fuch as rhubarb 
and aloes. When thick vifcid humours lurk in the firft paf- 
fages, and caufe want of appetite, belching and wind, then 
give pretty large dofes of natural falts, Epfom fait, in a draught 
of liquor, and it will carry them downwards. In melancholic 
and hypochondiac difeafes, as alfo in quartan agues, then 
magnefia alba is moft^ effectual j ealomel is often dangerous to 

childfen ; 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 3 

children : the neutral falts fhould be given from half an ounce 
to an ounce, particularly Epfom fait. 

LEPROSY. This is beft diftinguifhed by fcales appearing 
on the elbows and knees, which creep from thence gradually- 
all over the body ; though other obftinate fcabby eruptions are 
fometimes diftinguifhed by this name, efpecially if they are 
fcaly : the cure is the fame as in the ftubborn itch, only it ge- 
nerally requires a longer time, and a careful obfervation of a 
proper diet. 

LETHARGY. This is a heavy perpetual fieep, with 
fcarce any intervals of waking, and is attended with a quick 
pulfe j it docs not come on fuddenly, and may continue fome 
time. In the cure fuch things muft be ufed as tend to roufc 
the patient, fuch as cold water thrown on the head, holding 
volatile falts to the nofe, or burning feathers under it ; or poul- 
tices made with leaves of rue, bay-leaves, muftard-feed, caftor 
and camphire may be laid to the head and temples ; that is, a 
dram of camphire may be added to an ounce of the other in- 
gredients mixt with honey ; likewife derivation muft be made 
from the head by things that promote freezing : fuch as ten 
grains of fait of white vitriol diflblved in half an ounce of 
marjoram water, and drawn up the nofe ; blifters muft likewife 
be laid on the feet and neck : add to thefe, cupping the neck 
and moulders, as alfo ftrong frictions of the lower parts, and 
clyfters, with the addition of half an ounce of common fait. 
When the veflels are turgid with blood, bleeding will be ne- 
ceflary; irfwardly the patient may take the following bolus 
every four or fix hours. " Take of caftor a fcruple, of fait 
' of hartmorn five grains, of fyrup of fugar enough to make 
" a bolus ;" but care muft be taken to keep the body open 
with manna, rhubarb or clyfters. When the patient by thefe 
means is brought to himfelf, he muft ufe medicines that 
ftrengthen the nerves. 

LOCHIA. Thefe are the natural cleanfings of women after 
delivery ; when the quantity is too great it is called flooding, 
and may endanger the life of the patient, if not remedied in. 
time. When a woman is delivered, fhe mould be put to bed, 
and a iheet fhould be placed under her hips to receive the 
lochia ; warm linen fhould be applied to the genitil parts to 
keep out the air,- and a comprefs dipt in wine fhould be laiJ 
on the belly, but it muft not be bound too tight. When the 
milk fever comes on, the lochia commonly flop, but as foon 
as it is over return again : an immoderate flux brings on w eak- 

nefs,

fiefs, loathing and fainting, with a weak intermitting pulfe, 
The beft and fpeedieft remedy is the following powder, of which 
in urgent and dangerous cafes half a dram may be taken evey 
hour, in a fpoonful of fyrup, and feven dofes are generally fuffici- 
ent for a cure : " Take roch alum and dragons blood of each 
" two drams, mix and make a powder." When the cafe is not 
very urgent, half a dram of Jefuits bark, taken every two or 
three hours, will be fufficient. When the flux of the lochia 
is fupprefled, or is too fmall in quantity, the following plafter 
fhould be laid to the patient's belly. " Take of galbanum 
" diffolved in the tincture of caftor and ftrained three oun- 
" ces, of tacamahac two drams, mix and make a plafter." 
Then give the patient a fcruple of the compound plafter of 
myrrh every fourth hour : " take caftor, myrrh, faffron, of 
*' each fix grains, mix and make a powder." This muft be 
given in a little pectoral fyrup every fourth and fixth hour ; if 
thefe fail, give a dofe of liquid laudanum once only. If this 
likewife is ineffectual, give a fingle clj'fter of fugar'd milk ; if 
there is a loofenefs, it muft be ftopt. 

LOOSENESS. The difeafe is generally known, and needs 
no defcription ; fometimes this flux is neceflary to health, e- 
fpecially when it is not attended with weaknefs nor lofs of ap- 
petite ; in this cafe it is not to be ftopt at firft : but the pa- 
tient may drink warm diluting liquors or weak broth j after 
this he may take about twenty grains of rhubarb two or three 
times, in as many days. When there is a load of indigefted 
matter in the ftomach, it will be proper to begin with a vomit, 
or two ounces of ipecacuanha in wine; the next day " take 
" of rhubarb half a dram, of cinnamon twelve grains, mix 
" and make a powder :" this may be given two days together 
in any proper liquid, and fifteen drops of liquid laudanum 
each night. If the loofenefs is violent, add as much diafcor- 

D 

dium to the rhubarb as will make it into a bolus, as alfo two 
drops of the oil of cinnamon. 

If the patient is feverifh when attacked with this difeafe, 
then bleed, afterwards give a vomit, then rhubarb, and laft of 
all aftringents ; the aftringent may be thus compounded : 
" Take of the fhavings of logwood three ounces, of water 
" two quarts, boil to three pints, and then ftrain of? the li- 
" quor." The dofe is a tea-cup full every two hours, or 
four ounces four times a day. The firft gently loofen the belly, 
without raifing any commotions in the blood. 

MEASLES. 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 65 

MEASLES. This difeafe begins firft with chilnefs and fhi- 
vering, fucceeded with heat, and then heat and cold fucceed 
each other by turns. The next day the fever comes on with 
great ficknefs, thirft and lofs of appetite ; the tongue is white 
but not dry, with a little cough, a heavinefs of the head and 
eyes, and a continual fleepinefs : there is a fneezing, and fwell- 
ing of the eye-lids, fometimes a watry humour drops from the 
nofe and eyes, which is a certain fign the fpots will foon ap- 
pear ; which are fmall in the face, but broad and red on the 
breaft, not rifing above the furface of the fkin. The patient 
fometiines vomits, but oftner has a loofenefs with greenifh 
ftools. 

Thefe fymptoms increafe and continue till the fourth, fome- 
times till the fifth day, at which time the fpots appear like flea- 
bites, increafing in number and fize, running together in fome 
places, and rendering the face varioufly fpotted ; from the 
face the fpots proceed gradually to the breaft, belly, thighs 
and legs. The vomiting ceafes after this, but the cough and 
fever increafe, with difficulty of breathing : the weaknefs and 
defiuxion on the eyes, fleepinefs and want of appetLe ftill con- 
tinue. 

On the fixth day or thereabouts, the (kin of the face and 
forehead begin to grow rough, and the cuticle breaking, the 
puftules die away, while the fpots on the reft of the body con- 
tinue broad and red. On the ninth day they all vanifh, and 
fine thin fcales like flower fall from the fkin at that time. 

In the cure it will be proper to bleed before the eruption of 
the puftules, to prevent an inflammation of the lungs ; and 
then give either a gentle clyfter, or a laxative with manna, to 
relieve the cough, " Take oil of fweet almonds and thepe&o- 
" ral fyrup of each two ounces, of white fugar candy enough 
" to bring them to the thicknefs of a lambative." The pa^ 
tient may take a little of this as often as the coughing is trou- 
blefome : likewife take of the pedloral decotion a pint and a 
half, of the pectoral fyrup three ounces, mix them ; the dofe 
of this is three ounces four times a day, and at night, give aft 
ounce of diacodium mixt with three ounces of fimple alexite- 
rial water, increafing or diminifhing the dofe according to the 
age, but this muft be ufed fparingly during the increafe of the 
diftemper. Sometimes after the meafles difappear, there will 
happen a difficulty of breathing, a fever, and other fymptoms 
refembling an inflammation of the lungs. Now as this is caufcd 
by the ftriking in of the fpots, it may be prevented by giving 

E fifteen 



66 37v FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

fifteen grains of the bark every three hours, with five grains 
of the watry extract of myrrh, or more or lefs according to 
the age, in fmall cinnamon water; for the bark will caufe the 
fever and cough to ceafe on the feventh day, and the efflore- 
fcence will not leave the face till after the twelfth. When the 
fpots ftrike in before the due time, or become livid or of a bad 
colour, rub the whole body with a hot flannel, and then give 
the following bolus : " Take of virginian fnake-root fifteen 
44 grains, of caftor ten grains, of camphire three grains, of 
" fyrup of clove july-flowers enough to make a bolus." If 
the patient fweats profufely, his linen muft be changed for 
others dry and warm, taking care not to admit fudden cold, 
for that will ftrike in the puftules : if a loofenefs appears when 
the fcales fall off, it muft not be haftily ftopt, but a moderate 
dofe of rhubarb may be given now and then, with toafted 
nutmeg. 

MLNSES. Womens monthly courfes are fo called, and 
when they are irregular they are the caufe of many diforders ; 
when they are obftru6led, you are to confider whether the pati- 
ent is juft recovered from fomedifeafe, and there is confequently 
a want of good blood and juices. In this cafe, the patient muft 
take nourifhing broths and gcllies, and digefticn fhould be pro- 
moted by proper remedies and ftomachic bitters. Sometimes 
in the veflels of the womb and parts adjacent a paflage is de- 
ny'd to this evacuation, and then all forcing things are dan- 
gerous till the parts sre foftened and relaxed by fomentations 
and baths ; or which is better, the patient may be well covered 
and then placed over a hot bath, fo that the fleam or vapours 
may afcend and open the obftru&ions : it may be made in a 
veflel or tub of a convenient fize, with camomile flowers, 
pennyroyal and mugvvort boiled in the water ; red hot flints 
may be thrown in now and then to keep the water hot. When 
the blood is poor, it will be proper to ufe fpices, mynh, rofe- 
mary, pennyroyal, favine, and filings of iron : or, " Take 
* 4 fait of lied and myrrh of each eight grains, of faffron five 
*' grains, of oil of favine a drop ; mix the oil with the fugar r 
44 and then make the whole into a powder." This may be 
given twice or thrice a day in any proper vehicle; but if the 
patient is of a full habit of body, then 4t take of fait of am- 
44 ber fix grains, of faffron five grains, of the root of black 
44 hellebore ten grains, mix and make a powder ;" to be taken 
as before. But the beft remedy ready prepared is HOOPER's 

PILLS, 



The FAMILV PHYSICIAN. 67 

PILLS, which may le had of Mr. Newberry in St. Paul's 
Church-yard, London. 

When the menfes are evacuated in too great a quantity, or 
return too often, the ftrength of the patient will foon be 
brought low, with palenefs, coldnefs of the extremities, drop- 
deal fwellings of the feet, fainting, convuUions, and fome- 
times a dropfy. In common cafes, it will be fufficient to give 
half a dram of the bark four times a day, which feldom fails 
of producing the defired effect ; but when the flux is great, 
give the alum and dragon's blood mentioned under LOCHIA. 

NIGHT-MARE. This never attacks any one but in their 
fleep, when the patient lies on his back, and after eating a 
hearty fupper ; the patient feems to have a weight on his breaft, 
and ftrives to fpeak but cannot : fome think they fee monftrous 
fhapes, and that a witch or other imaginary beings ride on their 
cheft ; whence fome affirm they are hag-ridden ; however, if 
any body calls them by their name, or touches them, this fup- 
pofed load immediately vanifhes. The beft remedy is to eat 
little or no fupper, and to lie with the head pretty high ; it 
frequently affets children, becaufe they eat more than they can 
digeft. 

OEDEMATOUS TUMOUR, or falling. This is a cold, 
indolent and fuft, pitting tumour from watry humours, with- 
out any alteration of the fkin, except a (hining tenfity and 
fmoothnefs. 

When this is attended with a weaknefs, a dropfical difpofi- 
tion or old age, the patient muft take ftrengthening, cordial, 
fpicy, faponaceous medicines inwardly ; and outwardly^he part 
muft be rubbed with warm cloths often repeated, ufing mode- 
rate exercife gradually increafed. The legs and feet muft be 
fomented with a mixture of four ounces of lime water, four 
ounces of rectified fpirit of wine, and one ounce of roch 
alum ; then ftrait ftockings or bandages may be ufed, and the 
patient may take the bark inwardly, with fleel medicines, be- 
ginning with fmall dofes firft, and then iricreaung them gradu- 
ally. 

PAINS violent after DELIVERY. Thefe are often caufed by 
a retention of the after-birth or part of it, or from clotted 
blood in the cavity of the womb, or from hard labour, or 
from a defective flux of the lochia, or from wind, efpiciilly if 
the woman's belly has not been properly fwathed, or if (h- 3 has 
caught cold. In this cafe it will be proper to mix faffrcn with 
tea, or to drink tea made of camomile flowers, or to give a 

2 dram 



68 %bt FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

dram of the yellow part of orange peel : an ounce or two of 
oil of fweet almonds taken in a hot vehicle, will have a very 
good effect. Or, *' Take of fpermaceti a fcruple, of vola- 
" tile fait of hartfhorn five grains, of balfam of Peru five 
" drops, of Venice treacle half a dram, of fyrup of white 
" prppies enough to make a bolus:" this may be given 
foon after delivery. When there is a confiderable heat, give 
the following powder: *' Take of compourd powder of 
" crabs claws fifteen grains, of purified nitre five grains, of 
<c faffron four grains, of cinnabar three grains, mix and make 
" a powder ;" this may be given in a fpoonful of fyrup of 
fugar. In dangerous cafes give an emollient clyfter. 

PALSEY. This happens when any limb or member of the 
body is deprived of fenfe and motion, but more efpccially of 
the latter. VV hen the palfey afte&s all one fide of the body, 
it is generally the confequence of an apoplexy ; when on 
member only is paralytic, it has been preceded with pain 
and a defluxion ; and the parts affecled are generally foft, 
flabby and limber. The tongue is fometimes afflicted with the 
palfey, ancl then the patient cannot fpeak plain; fometimes the 
urinary paflages, and then the patient cannot hold his water. 
A ntimbntfs or trembling of any limb, is a flight kind of a 
palfey. 

When the palfey fucceeds an apoplexy, the patient's body 
fhould be kept open with tintura facra, and an ifTue fhould be 
made in the neck and (boulders above the blade bones ; befides, 
it will be ferviceable to anoint the fkin with a liniment made 
with two ounces of the green ointment, and a quarter of an 
ounce of flrong fpirit of vitriol. When the part is red, the 
liniment muft be taken off, and the part anointed with oint- 
ment of elder. The patient fhould drink fage-tea feveral times 
in a day, and fhould ufe muftard, horfe radifh and fpices pretty 
freely ; or the following mixture may be rubbed into the flabby 
limb : " Take compound fpirit of lavender three ounces, 
tc tindhire of cafK r half an ounce, of fpirit of fal ammoniac 
c< a quarter of an ounce, of caftor water fix ounce?, mix 
" them." He may likewifc take forty drops of the following 
cephalic mixture frequently on a lump of fugar : " Take 
" of the volatile aromatic fpirit or fal volatile drops three 
(i drams, of the compound fp : rit of lavender two drams, of 
" the tinclure of caftor one dram ; mix them :" but as the 
cure requires length of time, it will he proper to take medicines 
which will be always at hand, as the following diet drink : 

" Take 






The FAMILY PH YSI c i AN. 69 

" Take of wild valerian root ten ounces, of whole muftard- 
<c feed fix ounces, Virginian fnake-root and fage of each three 
" ounces, of new fmall ale ten gallons, mix them " the dofe 
of this is half a pint twice a day. Likewife as fteel is frequently 
found ferviceable in this difeafe, the following warm eleclary 
with fteel may be of great ufe : " Take of the ruft or filings 
" of fteel three quarters of an ounce, of candied ginger an 
" ounce, of conferve of orange peel three ounces, of fyrup 
" of orange peel enough to make an ele&ary." Some re- 
commend cold bathing, others the hot bath in Somerfetmire i 
but this laft is doubtful. 

PERIPNEUMONY, BASTARD. When this comes on, 
the patient is hot and cold by turns, is giddy upon the leaft 
motion, and complains of a rending pain of the head when- 
ever he coughs; his breathing is thick and ftiort, his cheeks 
and eyes look red and inflamed, he vom'ts up every thing that 
he drinks, his urine is turbid and intenfely red ; the whole 
cheft is full of pain, and when he coughs his lungs feem ex- 
ceeding ftrait : whence the free courfe of circulation is pre- 
vented, which fupprcfles the common fymptoms of a fever. 
When there is a perpetual laborious wheezing, oppreffion and 
anxiety about the heart, with drowfinefs, coldnefs of the ex- 
tremities, and the nails and face are ill coloured, the patient 
is in immediate danger. 

In the cure take away ten ounces of blood from a wide ori- 
fice, and the next morning give the patient two fcruples of the 
coloqutntida pills with aloes, not forgetting to lay a large blifter 
to the neck, and if there be occafion, to the legs and thighs. 
]f the patient is purged too much, he may fall into faintnefs 
and cold fweats ; if he fpits concoled matter with eafe 
and freedom, he muft neither bleed nor purge, at leaft du- 
ring the expectoration : but he may take gentle laxatives and 
clyfters of the fame kind ; as alfo thin muftard whey, or the 
pectoral decodYion, with a fmall quantity of white wine in 
them : likewife the faline draught made with a fpoonful of 
juice of lemons or vinegar, and enough of fait or fpirit of 
hartftiorn to neutralize them, that is, fpirit of hartftiorn may 
be dropt into the juice as long as it caufes any eftervefcence : 
it likewife relieves the difficulty of breathing, and commonly 
operates by fweat or urine. But if after bleeding the patient 
falls into great fleepinefs, and the breathing is very difficult, it 
will be proper to cup and fcarify the neck and fhoulders, which

has frequently had a furprizing effel ; when the cafe is very 
dangerous lay blifters on the fcarifications. 

PHLEGMON. This is an inflammatory tumour or fuell- 
ing, attended with rednefs, heat, pricking pain, tenfion or re- 
iiftance, with pulfation or throbbing. Thofe phlegmons that 
are flight, without any previous indifpofuion, are moft likely 
to difperfe ; thofe that follow a fever generally fuppurate j 
thofe in very old or dropfical people, when in a foft part, often 
turn to a gangrene or mortification ; when in a glandular part, 
to a fchirrus or cancer : likewife the parts moft diftant from 
the heart are moft likely to turn to a gangrene, and thofe 
neareft the heart to an abfcefs. 

Thefe inflammations may be difperfed by plentiful bleeding, 
by purging with Epfom fait, by living upon veal or chicken 
broth i by taking fix or feven grains of nitre diflbjved in 
broth, three or four times a day. 

But you muft never attempt to difperfe thefe tumour?, if 
there is* danger of a gangrene, if they are critical, if they 
are behind the ears, under the arm-pits, or in the groin ; if the 
humour is malignant, as in peftilential or venereal buboes, or 
from the bites of venemous beafts ; if the pain is exceeding 
violent ; if the patient has a bad habit of body ; or laftly, if 
there is any eruption on the fkin, as the herpes or the itch. 

This tumour may be brought to fuppuration by moift and 
emollient poultices, to relax and foften the fkin. " Take of 
'* the crumb of white bread eight ounces, of white foap an 
"ounce, of new milk a fufficient quantity, boil them to^e- 
" ther a little." It may alfo be promoted by plafters, oint- 
ments, or other unctuous topics. 

When the fwelling is ripe, it may be opened with a knife 
or lancet, according to the diie&ion of the fibres of the muf- 
cles, avoiding large branches of the blood-veflels, and in the 
moft depending part. Venereal buboes and fcrofulous tumours 
are beft opened with caufticks ; in venereal and peftilential 
buboes, we muft not wait till they are ripe. 

When the abfcefs is opened, it may be dreft atfirft with dry 
lint only, or with a foft digeMive fpread on dry lint. Over the 
doffils of lint, lay a large pledgit of tow fpread with bafilicon, 
which will lie much fofter than a defenfative plafter. The 
fame dreffings are to be continued with a proper regimen, till 
the cavity is filled up with fleftj by nature, taking care thai the 
bandage fit loofe and eafy : it may be cicatrifcd with dry lint 
or delkcative powders, keeping the margin clean and free 

from 



The FAMILY PHYSICIAN. jt 

from proud or fungous flefli, by making a moderate compref- 
fure with dry lint, or by levelling the furface with Roman vi- 
triol or red precipitate : the dreflings may be renewed in twenty 
four hours, in hot weather oftner, or when the difcharge is 
great. 

PHRENSY. This is an inflammation of the membranes of 
the brain, and is attended with a furious delirium, fhimng 
eyes which are fet as it were in the head, a burning fever, 
continual watching, and a violent pulfation of the arteries 
about the head and temples j it is generally a dangerous fymp- 
tom of a fever. 

When this is a primary or original difeafe, the cure requires 
fpeedy, large and repeated bleedings, particularly in the jugu- 
lar vein ; the nofe {hould be made to bleed with a ftraw, pen 
or flcewer, or fix or feven leeches to the temples: the reft of 
the cure confifts in blifters, and other things common to inflam- 
matory fevers. 

The SYMPTOMATIC PHRENSY fometimes appears in 
the ftate of the malignant, eruptive and fpotted fever, the 
fmall pox, malignant catarrhal fevers, and camp fevers, efpe- 
cially when they are injudicioufly treated. The cure of this 
is to be begun by bleeding, if the pulfe will bear it ; but if this 
cannot be done by reafon of the great lownefs, it muft be at- 
tempted by leeches and blifters ; it is ufual to begin with 
bliftering the head. The patient muft likewife take often fix 
grains of nitre mixt with one of camphire. 

When this difeafe is like to come on from the ftoppage of the 
lochia or menfes, the patient muft be bled fpeedily and largely 
in the foot. If from the ftoppage of the bleeding piles, leeches 
muft be applied to the veins, from whence the flux proceeded. 
The patient's drink {hould be whey turned with lemon juice and 
fweeetned with fyrup of white poppies, and a dram of purified 
nitre muft be added to every quart of the whey ; externally 
linen cloths may be dipt in hot water and applied to the feet; 
However, the method of cure muft be always accommodated to 
the primary difeafe. 

PLEURISY and PERIPNEUMONY. The pleurify is 
known by a violent pricking pain in the fide, a frequent hard 
pulfe, a difficult painful breathing, a very troublefome cough, 
and fometimes bloody fpittle; it is either moift or dry. In the 
peripneumonyy the pain is not fo acute, but is more tenfive, 
blunt and prefiing j the difficulty of breathing and anxiety is 

E 4 greater, 



?2 *?be FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

greater, the pulfe is foft and quick, the expe&oration more 
troublefome, and the fpittle is of various colours. 

In the cure, you muft bleed freely the three firft days of the 
difeafe, unlefs the fpitting begins in that time, and the bleeding 
muft be omitted or fo moderated, that the breaft may be re- 
lieved without checking the expectoration : after the fourth 
day bleeding is unfafe, but blifters will fhorten the cure, and 
prevent the lofs of a great deal of blood ; for a Ample pleurify, 
or one attended with, little inflammation of the lungs, may be 
cured with little bleeding, by a blifter of the fize of the hand? 
and fingers laid to the affected fi~e, and is beft applied imme- 
diately after the firft bleeding. If the fymptoms vanifh upon 
this application, it will be fafeft to bleed again, unlefs a profufe 
fweat eafes the pain, and then all other remedies will be ren- 
dered unnccefTary ; but if the lungs are much inflamed, the 
blifter and bleeding muft be repeated, though the patient is 
pretty eafy. 

In a PERIPNEUMON Y, bliftering is moft to be relied on 
after bleeding, firft on the back, and then on both the fides ; 
bliftering on the extremities likewife tends to eafe the breaft 
and promote expectoration -, bleeding muft be cautioufly ufed 
if at all, after die fpitting appears. 

In the firft ftage of either of thcfe difeafes, laxative clyfters 
are proper, as alib cool diaphoretics, fuch as eight grains of 
nitre made up into a bolus with confervc of hips ; but purges 
and warm diaphoretics are hurtful. Whenever the patient 
begins tofpit, diaphoretics muft be omitted, or joined to things 
that promote expectoration, of which the chief is oxymel of 
fquills; the dofe is from two drams to half an ounce. In low- 
nefs, after repeated bleedings, give the following pectoral bolus : 
" Take of fperma ceti fifteen grains, of gum ammoniac ten 
" grains, of fait of hartfhorn feven grains, of fyrup of fugar 
" enough to make a bolus." This is a powerful remedy to 
raife the pulfe, and to promote expectoration when it flags : 
notwithftanding this difcharge, if the lungs continue to labour, 
bleeding will be requifite, lor it will be dangerous to fufTer the 
lungs to be overpower'd by the omiinon of bleeding, as well 
as to hazard the fuppreffion of the fpitting by bleeding too 
freely ; but blifters are always feafonable. In the courfe of 
expectoration, a vomit, with an ounce and a half of oxymel of 
fquiils, will be ufeful to difcharge the load of vifcid phlegm. 
Opiates are not to be given when the pulfe is hard, the breath- 
ing difficult, or watchf ulnefs continually occafioned by a fever : 

but 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 73 

but when the fever is over and fleep is only prevented by a thin 
defluxion on the lungs, opiates will procure reft and promote 
the fpitting. If the phlegm is tough and the patient coftive, 
then fquills may be properly joined ; but if the body is open, 
and the head is affected with the opiate, fait of hartfhorn is the 
beft correclor. 

PURGATIVES. Thefe are much ftronger than laxatives, 
and act by means of a cauftic inflammatory fait, which ftimu- 
lates the nervous membranes of the inteftines to difcharge their 
contents ; they fhould never be made ufe of when laxatives 
will ferve, they h-tve often produced moft terrible and fatal 
effects ; they are very pernicious to infants, to old perfons, to 
fuch as have recovered from a difeafe, to thofe who have a weak 
ftomach, to thofe who are fubjet to nervous diforders, and to 
perfons of bilious conftitutions ; as alfo to thofe who are liable 
to hyfteric and hypochondriac diforders. 

They are often neceffary in the dropfy, anafarca, when there 
is no fchirrofity in the bowels and glands : in this let gamboge 
or elaterium be given in proper dofes, or two or three ounces of 
the juice of common purple 'flower-de-luce-in a pint of milk, 
for dropfical perfons, have a kind of dulnefs of the inteltinal 
fibres, which requires fuch a ftimulus : whenever thefe draftic 
purges are given, it will be beft to mix them with cream of 
tartar, or vitriolated tartar, and a few grains of the calx of 
antimony ; or extract of black hellebore, fcammony, rofm of 
jalap, or coloquintida fhould be corrected with cinnabar, faffron, 
fait of ambar, myrrh, or fome aromatic oil. 

QUiNSEY. This is an inflammation of the throat and fau- 
ces, and is attended with a fever, burning pain, fwelling and 
rednefs, with difficulty of breathing or fwallowing : when 
there is no outward rednefs, but a burning pain inwardly, a 
lof> of voice and difficulty of breathing, it often kills in twenty 
four hours : fometimes there is no outward rednefs, but a great 
difficulty of fwallowing and breathing, fo that whatever is 
drank returns through the nofe. 

In the cure bleed freely in the jugular, or firft in the arm, 
and then under the tongue ; but the laft is not quite fo fafe : 
then give the following purge. " Take of manna two 
" ounces, of Epfom fait a quarter of an ounce, of whey half 
" a pint ; diffolve the ingredients, and {train off the liquor." 
If this cannot be taken by the mouth, then give the following 
clyfter : " Take of milk half a pint, of oil of fweet almonds 
64 two ounces, of common fait a quarter of an ounce, of 
j " nitre 



74 e FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

" nitre a dram ; mix and make a clyfter :" likewife lay a 
ftrong and large blifter to the fore part of the neck, or one 
under the chin, and two more to the fides of the neck ; or, 
which is very efficacious, moiften a piece of flannel in the fol- 
lowing liniment, and lay it to the part affedted, which muft be 
renewed every five hours. " Take an ounce of oil of fweet 
*' almonds, and two drams of fpirit of fal ammoniac, ftir 
" them together in a wide-mouthed vial till they perfeSly 
" unite ; or take equal parts of oil and fpirits of hartfhorn, 
" and unite them as before." When the fkin will bear it, 
this laft may be ufed ; for a gargle, " boil two figs in a pint and 
" a half of milk and water to a pint, and to the ftrained li- 
" quor add two drams of the fpirit of fal ammoniac." This 
will thin thefpittle, and caufe it to evacuate more freely ; when 
the cure is not effe&ed by thefe means, the bleeding muft be 
repeated the next day, and the evacuation by ftool the follow- 
ing. To take off the fever, if it continues, give half a dram 
of the mixture of contrayerva root and purified nitre, every 
fix hours, or Dr. JAMES'S Fever powder j when the fymptoms 
are very urgent, the bleeding may be repeated in fix or eight 
hours time after the firft. 

RHEUMATISM. This difeafe generally attacks perfonsin 
the autumn, and fometimes in the fpring ; it is preceded with 
a wearinefs, a heavinefs and coldnefs of the extreme parts, 
which is followed with a chilnefs and fhivering, then a fever, 
inquietude and thirft ; the pulfe is quick and narrow, the ap- 
petite is loft, and the body coftive. In a day or two the pati- 
ent feels a racking pain fometimes in one joint, fometimes in 
another, but more frequently in the wrifts, fhoulders and 
knees ; often fhifting from place to place, leaving a red- 
nelsin the place laft vifited : fometimes it attacks the loins, and 
the lower part of the back bone. 

When the diftemper is mild, that is, when there is a fever 
xvith rheumatic pains without a fwelling, the cure may be 
completed in a few days by twice or thrice bleeding, and promo- 
ting a diaphorefis with vinegar whey ; this is made by boiling 
a pint of milk with a pint of water, and then turning it with 
two fpoonfuls of vinegar. But when the rheumatifm is attend- 
ed with an inflammatory fwelling of the joints, fweatin^ is im- 
proper, and the cure is to be obtained by repeated and almoft 
daily bleedings, till the patient's fever is gone, and the pains 
are removed or eafierj for this diftemper generally attacks 
fuch as can bear thefe evacuations. In this cafe, when the pain 

and 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 75 

and fwelling of the joints remain, apply three or four leeches 
to the part where the fwelling and inflammation are greateft ; 
and let the blood ooze out till it flops of itfelf ; the repetition 
of this method need not be limited : but if there is not both an 
inflammation and a fwelling, leeches will do no good. Inter- 
nal medicines are of little fervice, and the diet muft be of the 
loweft kind ; nor will outward applications avail any thing 
while the fever or inflammation remains. 

If the rheumatifm is confined to one part of the body with 
little or no fever, it may be cured by bleeding once, and fweat- 
ing, with the following draughts : " Take half a dram of 
<l g um guaiac diflblved in the yolk of an egg, two ounces 
" of fpring water, half an ounce of ftrong alexiterial wa- 
" ter, an ounce of the fpirit of Mindererus, and two drams 
" of the fyrup of orange peel ; mix them, and divide them in- 
" to two draughts." One of thefe is to be taken over night, 
and the other early the next morning. If the patient does not 
fweat eafily, give fixty drops of the balfam of guaiacum three 
or four times a day. 

The chronic rheumatifm, which is either the remains of a 
rheumatick fever, or proceeds from neglecled colds, requires 
the taking away eight ounces of blood once in eight or ten 
days, as long as it continues fizy, or the complaints remain : 
between whiles let the patient be purged in the following man- 
ner : " Take two fcruples of gum guaiac diflblved in the 
" yolk of an egg, of fpring water two ounces, of nutmeg 
*' water two drams, of the fyrup of orange peel a dramj 
" mix them for a draught to be taken in a morning, keeping 
" within doors." On the intermediate days give fixty drops of 
fpirit of hartfhorn thrice in twenty four hours, if the joints 
are fwelled and inflamed, leeches are to be ufed as before ; but 
if there is no inflammation, the aching parts rr.uft be rubbed 
with flannel, and anointed with the volatile or faponaceous 
liniment : when this courfe has been continued fome time, 
the recovery will be haftened by the ufe of the cold hath and 
riding. In fome cafes, it will be proper to give a fcruple of 
calomel over night, and to purge it off the next morning; 
this may be repeated once or twice a week. When every 
thing elfe fails, recourfe muft be had to the gout-powder men- 
tioned under the article of the gout. 

RHEUM in the EYE. When there is a hot fait defluxion 
falls upon the eyes, which glews the eyelids together, cfpeci- 
ally in the night time, you muft take a grain of white vitriol, 

and 



76 $be FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

and mix it intimately with a little unfalted butter. Put this 
into the greater corner of the eye at night going to bed, and 
it will effect: a cure. A PELLICLE or thin fkin which covers 
the eye may be taken off with the frefh fat of vipers dropt into 
the eyes. 

RICKETS. This is a difeafe of children very well known. 
To cure it, give ten grains of calomel, and ten grains of rhu- 
barb three times, allowing a day between each dofe ; then give 
a fcruple of Ethiops mineral twice a day for feme time. But 
above all, dip the child every morning in a cold bath. 

SCURVY. This is known by a fpontaneous wearinefs, 
heavinefs of the body, difficulty of breathing, efpecially after 
bodily motion, rottennefs of the gums, ftinking breath, fre- 
quent bleeding of thenofe, and difficulty of walking. There 
is fometimes a fwelling, and fometimes a falling , away of the 
legs ; in which there are always livid, plumbeous, yellow, or 
violet coloured fpots. The colour of the face is generally of 
a pale tawney. 

When the pulfeis weak, fmall, and unequal, it is a fign of 
the cold fcurvy, which is beft cured by mineral waters ; but 
when thefe cannot be had, you may fubftitute a pure light 
fpring water in which a hot iron has been quenched. Befides, 
a milk diet and whey will be proper to deftroy the fcorbutic 
acrimony, efpecially when mixt with the fcorbutic juices : fix 
ounces may be mixt with as much whey as will ferve a day. 
Or, " Take of the fcorbutic juices a quarter of a pint ; of 
" cow's milk a pint ; boil them till the milk is turned, and then 
ct take off the curd." This will ferve for one day. Some think 
the chief virtue of tar-water is to cure the fcurvy. 

The principal medicines againft a odd fcurvy, are, winters 
bark, buckbeans, garlick, horfe-radifli, muftard-feed, com- 
pound hor^-radim water, and elixir of property; to which 
may be added the Peruvian bark. But in the hat fcurv\ , which 
is known by a great and hard pulfe, they muft never be given 
without acids, fuch as wood forrel, and the juice of oranges, 
with cooling fallads, barley-broth, and a low diet. 

Thofe that live on falted meats, as failors, and have rotten 
gums, a (linking breath, eating ulcers, and faltifh urine, fhould 
Jive upon vegetables, and ripe fruits if poffible : and while 
they are at fea, they (hould take from twenty to fifty drops 
of fpiritof fait. They {hould likewife wafh their gums and 
fores in fea-water, and cover the latter with foft cloths or 

fpunges 



The FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 77 

fpunges dipt therein. Likewife, fea-water may be taken in- 
wardly at the fame time. 

Thofe that likemedicines in another form may take the follow- 
ing : " Take of conferve of fcurvy-grafs, two ounces ; of 
" conferve of wood forrel, an ounce ; of the compound pow- 
" der of arum, fix drams; of fyrup of lemons, enough to 
" make an ele&ary." The dofe is the quantity of a nutmeg 
to be taken in the morning, at five in the afternoon, and at 
night, drinking a glafs of the compound horfe-radifh-water 
after each dofe. 

All kinds of evacuations have a doubtful effect in this difeafe, 
and therefore may be omitted. No purge muft be given 
ftronger than a laxative ; and when there is a loofcnefs, it is 
beft cured with toafted rhubarb. 

When the fldn is affe&ed with corroding eruptions, the fol- 
lowing eledtary will be proper : " Take of fine powder of 
'* crude antimony, half an ounce; of conferve of garden fcurvy- 
" grafs ; two ounces of gum-guaiac, two drams ; of the fyrup of 
" the juice of lemons, enough to make an eleftary." The 
dofe is the fize of a nutmeg morning and evening, drinking a 
fmall draught of the decoction of the woods, or lime-water 
after it. 

SLEEPINESS. This difeafe is known to phyficians by the 
name of coma fomno'enttrm, in which the patient complains of 
a conftant drowfinefs. The patient often falls afleep at meals, 
in converfation, and in the midft of bufinefs, and when he is 
awaked he foon falls afleep again. It is not attended with any 
fever. 

There are two kinds ; the one is ferous or watry^ and the 
other funguine. The firft requires the ferous evacuations to be 
rcftored or promoted. Sneezing powders are of great ufe, be- 
caufe they difcharge the ferum through the nofe, and ftimulate. 
When there is a load of vifcid phlegm on the fromach, give 
two grains of emetic tartar, with an ounce of manna, diflblved 
in water gruel, and this will carry it off upwards and down- 
wards. 

In the fanguine kind, when the blood circulate? flowly thro* 
the head, or Magnates there, as in thofe that are hypochondriac 
or fcorbutic, all hot fpirituous remedies are as bad as poifon ; 
but bleeding, clyfters, gentle laxatives, cooling and nervous 
powders are ufcful. A red face, and eyes turgid with blood, 
Ihow that bleeding is necelTary. 

Warm 



78 The FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

Warm baths are bad in fleepy diforders, as well as faffYon 
and opiates. Volatile fpirits and falts are good in the cold fe- 
rous kind, but not in the fanguine. Sneezing powders fhould 
not be ufed in the beginning of this difeafe if the body is full 
of blood becaufe they caufe the humours to flow to the head, 
which may occafion an apoplexy. 

SMALL-POX. This is of two kinds, the dj/ltntf, and ccn- 
fuent* The diftinct begins with chilnefs and (hivcring, intenfe 
heat,, a violent pain in the head and back, and an inclination 
to vomit. Epileptic fits in children, if breeding of the teeth 
is over, is a fign the fmall-pox is at hand. On the fourth day 
the fpcts appear, which are at firft reddifh and fpread themfelves 
over the face, neck, breaft, and the whole body. Then there 
is a pain in the threat, which increafes as the puftules grow 
turgid. 

On the eighth day, the fpaces between the puftules grow 
reddifh, and are aff 6ted with a tenfive pain ; the eye-lids are 
puffed up and clofe the eyes. Next after the face, the hands 
begin to fwell, and the fingers are diftended ; the puftules of 
the face, before fmooth and red, begin to grow rough and 
whitifh, and throw out a yellow matter in colour like honey- 
comb. The inflammation of the face and hands being now 
at the height, the fpaces between the puftules are of the colour 
of damaflc rofes j and the more mild the difeafe is, the greater 
is the likenefs. The puftules about the face grow more rough 
and yellow as they ripen ; but on the hands and other parts of 
the body, they grow more white and lefs rough. On the ele- 
venth day, thefwellingof the face and inflammation difappear ; 
the puftules being ripe, and of the fize of a large pea, grow drjr 
and fall off". On the fourteenth or fifteenth day, they perim 
entirely} except fomeobftinate puftules on the hands, which 
continue a day or two longer, and then break. The reft come 
off in branny fcales. Throughout the whole courfe of this 
d feafe, the patient's body is either wholly coftive, or he goes to 
{tool but very feldom. 

Thus, the firft ftate of the difeafe, from the time of inva- 
fion, till the appearance of the fpots, is four days. The fecond- 
ftate or time of eruption, continues from the fourth day till the 
fcventh. The time of maturation, or ripening, is from the 
feventh till the eleventh. The fourth ftate, or time of exficca- 
tion, or drying of the puftules, is from the eleventh to the 
fourteenth or fifteenth. 

In 



F A M I LY P H Y S I C I A N. 79 

In the confluent fert, all the fymptoms are more violent; on the 
tMrd day, and fometimes before, the fpots appear, and the 
fooner the more they will run together. When there is a very 
violent pain in the loins, like the gravel; in the fide, like a pleu- 
rify ; in the joints, like a rheumatifm ; in the ftomach, with 
ficknefs and vomiting ; the eruption may be retarded till the 
fourth or fifth day. But when this happen', the fymptoms do 
not abate as in the diftint fort, but the fever and other com- 
plaints continue many days after. As the fever increafes, the 
puftules do not arrive to any confiderable height, but are 
entangled with each other in the face, appearing like a red 
blifter, and covering all the countenance, which fwells fooner 
than in the diftinft kind. Afterwards they appear like a white 
fkin glued to the face, and are not much higher than the 
furface. 

After the eighth day, this (kin or pellicle grows more rough, 
and of a dufky colour ; the pain of the fkin becomes more 
intenfe; and in the more cruel kind they do not fall off in broad 
large fcales, till after the twentieth day. The browner the 
puftules are, they are worfe, and the longer in falling off; but 
the more yellow they are the lefs they run together, and the 
fooner they fall off. 

When the fkin or pellicle falls off, there is no roughnefs on 
the face, but branny fcales come in their room, of a very cor- 
rofive nature, which leave pits behind, and fometimes ugly 
fears. 

The danger of thedifeafe is to be eftimated from the num- 
ber and multitude of the puftules on the face alone. The pa- 
tient is in moft danger, in the common confluent fort, on the 
eleventh day from the firft attack ; in the more crude the 
fourteenth, and in tl>e moft crude the feventeenth. 

In the milder fmail pox, the fever is feparated by two perfect 
intermiflions ; and though they run into each other in the ma- 
lignant fort, yet the traces of the limits may be difcerned by 
fome degree of remiflion. Thus, there is a fever of defpumz- 
tion-i and another of maturation^ to which may be added a 
third of retrocejjion^ commonly called the fecondary fe\ er ; for 
the very moment the bafes of the puftules loofe their fiery co- 
lour, this fever kindles like a flam of lightning. 

Some divide the fmall-pox into thejimple, and the malignant. 
The fimple is, when the eruption is attended with a flight fever 
of fbort duration ; the malignant is, when the eruption appears 
with a malignant fever, and the puftule* hardly come to any to!e-

rable degree of ripencls. This has puftules of three forts : 
the cryJiaUine, which are almoft tranfpurent and like bladders 
filled with thin water. The warty: thefe contain no fluid 
and are like warts ; they are peculiar to the diftinct fort. The 
bloody : thefe are fometimes fmall tubercles filled with a black- 
ifti blood, as if the fkin had been pinched with nippers, and 
are attended with purple and livid fpots. Sometimes the pu- 
liules, after the third or fourth day of their coming out, be- 
come livid and a little bloody with black fpots over all the bo- 
dy, which forebode death in a day or two ; in this cafe the 
blood will flow out from every part of the body, fuch as the 
mouth, nofe, eyes, and urinary pafTages 

In the cure, when the pulfe is rapid, full, tenfe, the breath- 
ing hot, {hort, and laborious, the urine high, the thirft great, 
the tongue dry and foul, the pain in the head, back, loins, and 
limbs exceeding acute, there can be no doubt about the necef- 
fity of bleeding. 

But bleeding is by no means proper, when the difeafe comes 
on with the ufual fymptoms of a flow nervous fever, when the 
patient has been drooping for fome time, and the fever is low, 
the fpirits funk, the pulfe weak, quick, and fluttering, the 
countenance pale and fallen, the urine crude and thin, no great 
thirft, no great heat, a continual giddinefs and heavinefs of the 
head, with tremblings, a perpetual naufea and puking, weak- 
nefs and wearinefs, which ends in the fmall pox of a very bad 
fort, being pale, crude and pitted, never rifing well, but con- 
tinuing flat and flaccid, or running together in large watery 
bliflers, full of thin imlijefted matter, and fo remaining to the 
laft, while in the face, from a deadly pale colour like a corps, 
they turn to a ghaftly black, if the patient live long enough ; 
and even then, they generally prove fatal at laft. 

Sometimes, as was obferved above, the fmall pox is attended 
with a malignant fp tted fever, with profufe bleeding, bloody 
and gangrenous puftules ; even when the pox are very few and 
diftincK Each of which particular cafes require a particu- 
lar method, and a regard to the difeafes to which they are re- 
lated. 

In the firft cafe, befides the fymptoms alicady mentioned, if 
an acute pain in the head, rednefs of the eyes, throbbing of 
the carotid and temporal arteries, denote the approach of a 
phrenzy, it will be neceffary to bleed in the foot, as well as the 
arm, which generally has an admirable effect. After bleeding, 
a vomit fhouid be given, if the {tomach abound with phlegm 

or

or bile, or be loaded with food unfeafonably taken. Otherwife 
before the eruption of the pull ales, a parge may be prefcribed 
with the infufion of fena and manna, or with manna alone, 
efpecially for children. If in the courfe of this difcafe the 
patient fliould be coftive, his body is to be o ened with a 
clyfter every fecond or third day. Likewife, under thefe cir- 
cumftances, the fever powder of Dr. 'James has always had 
falutary confequences, when given in tim?, and has difpofed the 
,patient to go through every ifage of the difeafe, free from thofe 
alarming circumftances which frequently attend this difeafe, 
when unafiifted with fo powerful a medicine. 

Moreover, the following powder has a tendency to keep t':c 
inflammation of the blood within due bound., and to aflift the ex- 
pullion of the morbific matter throug 1 the (kin : " Take of com- 
" pound powder of crabs claws, half an ounce; of purified nitre, 
" two drums; mix andmar.e a powder." Half a dram of this 
may be given to an adult three or four times a day, diminifliing 
jhe quantity for children in proportion to their age. When the 
fever runs high, equal quantities of the ingredients may be pre- 
fcribed, and the patient's drink may beftiarpened with fpirit of 
vitri 1. When there is a reaching to vomit, it may be ap- 
peafed with a fpoonfu! of the juice of lemons', and a fcruple of 
the fait of wormwood. 

When t;e eruption of the puuules are completed, the pa- 
tient may take an ounce of the fyrup of white poppies in the 
evening ; and when the inquietude is great, it may be repeated 
in the morning. On the tenth day r from the invafion, at night, 
fhe dofe may be increafed to an ounce and a half, and an ounce 
in the morning, and fo o::, till the patient recovers, unlefs there 
be a delirium, for then it is not convenient. Eighte n drops 
of liquid laudanum may be given inftcad of an ounce of the 
fyrup. But not when there is a fliortr.efs of breath, or ti.e 
patient is like to be choaked with vifcid flime. un'efs oxymcl of 
fquills be given at the fame time, or r.;ther the fteam here- 
after mentioned. When the vefi:Ies do not fill, give from ten 
grains to f.rty of the peruvian bark in fyrup of orange peel, di- 
luted with nutmeg water, every fourth or fifth hour ; children 
may take it in a clyfter. 

But in order to prevent bad fympto;7is, on the day before the 
face is expected to fink, the arms and legs mud be wrapt up 
liihtly in a fuppurating cerate ; for irr.tance, the yellow ccrator, 
which is made by melting an ounce of bees wax with half a 
pound of yellow bafilicon. It rnufi be fpreacl on linen rollers.

and tacked together fo as to make one continuous plafter. This 
facilitates the tranflation of the acrid ferum from the face and 
head to the limbs, promotes the fuppuration of it when it is 
tranflated, and prefently removes the burning pain, which is 
infupport;;ble at this time of the difeafe. Thus, this dangerous 
pesiod may be part over without any alarming fymptom. 

Some perfons, otherwife ftrong, fall into a vaft dejedtion of 
fpirits at the time of the feizure with the fmall pox through 
fear, and then a little blood mould be taken away as early as 
poflible, which muft be repeated if neceffary, but not too large 
a quantity at once. Likewife fomething cordial may bz given 
to chear the heart, and blifters muft be applied to prevent the 
patient from finking under the difeafe ; efpecially when there 
is a rawnefs, forenefs, or great heat of the mouth and throaJ, 
with a fharp rheum, or a ftoppage of the noftrils, with fre- 
quent freezing and a tickling cough. When the matter of fa- 
livation is very vifcidand clogs the throat, the beft method rs 
to boil marfh-mailows, myrrh, and honey in a fufficient quan- 
tity of water and vinegar, and then tranfmit the fteam into the 
patient's mouth, through a glafs or t'rn pipe, of fuch a fhape and 
length as is futtable to the perfon while he lies down. This 
has been found by long experience to be very falutary. 

When the fmall pox has relation to the nervous fever, fome 
cafy cordial nervous medicines will be neceflary, fuch as fack- 
whey, wine and water, and in the more low deprefTed cafe, 
wine alone. Blifters may be now employed, and ftiraulating 
cataplafms to the feet. 

In the malignant fort of the cryJJaUinefmaU pox, the water 
of the puftules can never be brought to laudable fuppuration, 
and therefore it will be proper to give from a fcruple to half a 
dram of nitre, three or four times a day, in fmall wine, to car- 
ry off the groffer humours. And towards the end of the difeafe, 
the patient may be allowed a little canary to comfort the heart. 
The flux of the humour into the puftules may be promoted 
by the cordial confection, or a fcruple of the compound powder 
of crabs-claws with three grains of faffron, or the bark in the 
manner above mentioned, or rather the following tin&ure of 
it, which is an excellent medicine : " Take of the Peruvian 
" bark, two ounces ; of the yellow part of orange peel, an 
** ounce and a half; of Virginian fnake-root, three drams; 
" of faffron four fcruples ; of French brandy, a pint and a 
" quartern; put them together into a bottle, ftopitclofe, and 
" kt it ftand for three or four days, and then ftrain off the 

tv tine.-

" tin&ure." The dofe is from a dram to half an ounce, 
every fourth or fixth hour. You may allb give the plain fpirit of 
hartfhorn. The patient may be allowed a difh of coffee now 
and then, with a little thin milk in it, 

Befides, thefe on the fifth or fixth day of the eruption, 
blifters are to be applied between the moulders, and to the 
arms and legs, to difcharge the ferofities, and to help the 
fever. 

The warty J "mall-pox is more dangerous than the cryftalline, 
becaufe the matter of the difeafe is too thick, and will neither 
fuppurate nor pafs off by urine. Here the above cordial me- 
dicines come in play, and blifters alfo : but there are little or 
no hopes from any method. 

In the bloody fmall-pox thofe medicines are beft, which by 
their ftyplicity thicken the blood, and prevent its breaking 
through the fmalleft arteries. In this cafe butter-milk will lend 
great affiftance, efpecially as it is an enemy to putrefaction. 
As alfo, Peruvian bark, alum, and oil of vitriol; but more 
particularly equal quantities of roch alum and dragon's blood 
melted together and beaten into a powder. A fcruple or half 
a dram of this made into a bolus with conferve of rofes, is a 
proper dofe. It may be repeated in a few hours in dangerous 
bleedings. In lefs urgent cafes, a dram of the Peruvian bark 
may be given every fixth hour; or five or fix fpoonfuls of the 
tindlure of rofes, may be taken feveral times a day : and the 
patients drink may be {harpened with it, when there are purple 
or black fpots interfperfed among the puftules. When there is 
a delirium, blifters may be fafely applied. 

About the ninth or tenth day from the eruption a putrid fe- 
ier, common called the feccndary fever, may come on, and it 
has been common to give gentle purges ; as alfo to bleed when 
the heat is too great, and the patient's ftrength will bear it, not 
omitting blifters . But the patient may be cured without 
bliftering or bleeding, if he takes the abforbent nitrous powder, 
of compound powder of crabs-claws with nitre, before men- 
tioned; as alfo analeptics and plenty of diluting abforbent li- 
quors. The bark has likewife good effects in mitigating the 
fecondary fever, unlefs the lungs be fluffed, and then it is to 
be omitted. 

There are accidents in tie fmall-pox which do not always 
occur, and therefore it will be neceflary to mention them. 
Sometimes the patient is feized with convulfions juft before the 
eruption, which in children is no bad fign ; and then no blood

inufl be taken away, but ablifter may be laid to the neck, and 
a plafter with equal parts of the cephalic and bliftertng plafter 
maybe laid to the feet Inwardly he may take wild valerian- 
root, Ruffian caftor, and the fpirits of hardhorn. 

When there is an entire fuppreflion of urine, the patient's 
body may beppened with a clyfter, and he may take Glauber's 
fait, which is diuretic and la.vativc ; or rather, \vhich is the belt 
medicine, fait of amber, if it can be had genuine. The dofe 
is from eight grains to twenty. 

When the eruption appears without much fever and pain, 
and the puftulcs do not ripen, it will be fucceeded with a fever, 
attended with reitieiihefs of body, anxiety, of mind, difficulty 
of breathing, and a delirium. In this cafe warm medicines 
iliould be given to increafe the fever at firft, and afterwards to 
promote fuppura ion. For this laft intention, li Take of Virgi- 
" man fnake-root, twelve grains ; of contrayerva-root, fix 
" grains ; myrrh and faffron, of each five grains ; mix and 
" make a powder." This may be taken every four or five 
hours, in any prcjit; vehicle. But Peruvian bark, as was ob- 
ferved before, is excellent in this cafe, and particularly the 
tincture of it above mentioned. If the patient is low, a blifter 
will be neceffary. 

When the matter of infection is over abundant, it will pro- 
duce a fpitting on the firft day of the eruption in adults, and 
in children a Joofentfs almoft throughout the whcle difeafe. If 
in adults the fpitting does not fucceed to our wifhea, it fhould 
be promoted with gargles made with a decofiion of muftard- 
feed and pepper mixt with oxymcl : for in the confluent 
and malignant fort, it ought to continue to the end of the 
difeafe. 

When a woman with child mifcarries in the fmall-pox, and 
the flux of the lochia is too large, fhe muft take the fame re- 
medies as in the bloody fmall-pox. If a woman's monthly e- 
vacuations appear in this difeafe, they rather afford relief than 
threaten danger, unlefs the difcharge is fo great as to weaken the 
patient, and then fhe muft take the Ikme remedies as in the 
bloody fmall-pox. 

SCALD-HEAD. This is an ulcerated cruft or fcab, fpread- 
ing over the hairy fcalp with an ill fmell and a violent itching: it 
has often inequalities like a honey-Comb, and moftly affecls 
children. At firft, the head is over-run with a white, dry, 
branny covering ; then it appears granulated like the infide of 
a fig when cut a crofs j and laft, it lov>ks like a honey-comb 

as

*is, above. In the cure, great care mu ft be taken not to drive 
the humour back by judicious applications, for that will be 
fatal to the child. The beft way will be to correct the blood, 
by taking prepared oifter-fliells, crabs eyes, diaphoretic an- 
timony, or the like. As alfo, by two or three grains of cin- 
nabar at night, or five grains of Ethiop's mineral. Some give 
calomel, but it is often dangerous to infants. The (cabs may 
be foftened with cream, or calves marrow, or frefti butter; 
The rood efficacious of all external medicines, is tar melted 
with an equal quantity of mutton fuct: touch the foabs lightly 
with thisatfirft, and as you find the effefr, proceed more free- 
ly, always remembring to give the internal medicines firft. 
The furgeons would have a pitch plafter laid over a!! the head 
to remove the fcabs, and pull all the hair up by the roots 3 but 
this is a cruel operation, and likewife unneceflary, when the 
former rules are obferved. The fmarting of the tar ointment 
is but a flea-bite to this. 

SEDATIVES. In this clafs anodynes are generally mention- 
ed, which I have already fpoken of. They act by allaying 
fpafms and appealing violent motions. In this cafe, nitre Or 
falt-petre. is of extraordinary ufe, becaufe itas by retraining 
the hot fulphufeous parts of the blood, by moivlening the fo! ids?, 
and curbing their exorbitant motions ; upon which account: 
it is anodyne, and good againft fpafms. Cinnabar is of great 
fervice in appeafing convulfive and epileptic diforders, for it 
diflblves the thick mucus which affects the brain and fpinal 
marrow. Camphire mixt with nitre is excellent in pain, watch- 
ing, and deliriums attending inflammations. Afla fcetida re- 
laxes the fpafms of the inteftines in hyfterk: fits, by opening 
the obftruclions of the glands and other vefiels. 

SIGHT, dimnefs cf. This fometimes proceeds from a wea'c- 
nefs '-f constitution, and lownefs of fpirits, and fometimes from the 
forming of cataract, or the beginning of guttaftuwa. I n the firft 
'cafe, it will be proper to drink tea conftantly made with cepha- 
lic herbs and roots, varying them at pleafure. Thefe-are, wild 
valerian root, the leaves of betony, fage, rofemary, fennel, 
and the flowers of rofemary and lavender. In the other cafe', 
regard muft be had to the difeafes; but the cataract muft be 
fuffered to grow ripe and hard, and then it muft be depreft by 
a furgeon fkilful in thefe matters. Sometimes a perfon can only 
fee near objects ; in this cafe he muft make ufe of a concave 
clafs, to be had of the opticians. When he can only fee dt-

ftant objects diftinclly, which is almoft the conftant attendant 
of age, he muft ufe a convex glafs or fpe&acles. 

SPASMS, STICH, CRAMP. Thefe are generally of 
the fame nature, only the pain of the pleurify is fometimes 
improperly called a ftitch. They are an involuntary contrac- 
tion of any mufcle, or of the mufcular, membranous, or ner- 
vous fibres. Sometimes fimple frictions will perform a cure, 
for this will often have fuch an effect that the thick humour, or 
ftiarp matter may be removed or difperfed thereby; or it may be 
appeafed by the application of fpirit of wine and camphire, or 
Hungary water, or fpirits of lavender. When there is a very 
violent cramp, enquiry muft be made whether the blood is too 
abundant, or whether the cuftomary bleedings have been ftopt; 
if this be the cafe, bleeding in the arm will contribute to a cure, 
and the ufual evacuations muft be reftored. Outwardly, the 
fpine of the back muft be rubbed carefully with the faponaceous 
liniment or opodeldoc When the parts remain hard or ftiff, 
anoint them with the ointment of marm-mallows, or the fat 
of capons, or neat's foot oil, or oil of rofemary. if it returns 
often ufe temperate baths, regular diet, and drink the Spaw 
waters. The following liniment is excellent in thefe cafes : 
" Take of Venice foap, two drams ; of camphire, two fcru- 
" pies ; oil of mace by expreflion and Hungary water, of 
" each half a dram ; of the fpirit of fal ammoniac, thirty 
" drops; of the oil of juniper, forty drops ; of caftor a dram 
<c and a half; mix them and make a liniment." 

SPITTLE, to provoke. See APOPHLEGMATIZANTS. 

SQUINTING. The mod common caufe of fquinting, is 
an inequality of the ftrength of the eyes. To prove thi, 
place the perfon near a window, and caufe him to look at a 
fmall object, a pen for inftance; you will readily perceive 
which eye is directed towards it ; then cover that eye with your 
hand, and the perfon will be furprized to find that he has quite 
loft the pen ; which is a demonftration, that he fees but with 
one eye : therefore the beft method of cure, is to exercife the 
weak eye by covering the other now and then, and making 
ufe of the weak eye only. This method will generally fucceed 
when the fquinting is curable. 

STOMA CH, inflammation of. This is known by a con- 
tinual fever, a fixed, burning, pricking pain at the pit of the 
ftomach, which grows worfe when any thing is fwallcwed 
down , then follows a painful vcmiting and hiccup. Add to 

thefe 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 87 

thefe a hard, contracted, quick pulfe, great reftleflhefs, thiift, and 
coldnefs of the extremities. When it is owing to poifon, a vio- 
lent emetic or purge, give new milk with falladoil, cream, or 
oil .of fweet -almonds. When eruptions of the fkin are drove 
back, direct emuliions of cold feeds, a few grains of nitre, 
with one of carnphire mixt with a fcruple of compound pow- 
der of crabs claws. In other cafes after bleeding, the beft re- 
medy is a blifter laid on the part affeded. 

STONE in the bladder. This is known from a pain at the 
time of making water, as well as before and after, from the 
urine coming away by drops, or flopping fuddenly when in a 
full ftream ; from a white, thick, copious, mucous, {linking 
fediment in the urine ; from an itching or pain in the head of 
the penis ; from a tenefmus or defire of going to ftool while the 
urine is difcharged ; and by fearching with the finger or a ca- 
theter. To diflblve the ftone, the patient muft fwallow an 
ounce of Alicant foap in what form he likes bed, and drink 
three pints or more of oifter or cockle fhell lime-water. If 
the foap is divided into three dofes, the largeft muft be taken 
early in the morning fafting, the fecond at eleven before neon, 
and the third at five in the afternoon, drinking a large draught 
of lime-water after each dofe ; the remainder of which muft 
be drank at meals inftead of other liquors. If the tafte of the 
water is not agreeable, a little new milk mixt with it will make 
it palatable. If the patient cannot take the foap, a larger 
quantify of lime-water perfifted in for fome time, may produce 
the effect without it. He fhould abftain from acids arid fer- 
menting liquors. But he may drink punch without acid, com- 
monly called rumbo. Spirits muft not be drank at ?11, and he 
muft forbear fait meats, honey and acid fruits. But he may 
eat artichoaks, afparagus, fpinnage, lettuce, parfeley, purflane, 
turneps, carrots, potatoes, radifhes, and green peas ; but more 
cfpecially onions, leeks and cellery. For common drink he 
may ufe milk and water, but mould drink no more than will 
juft quench his thirft, and he fhould retain his urine as long as 
he can without uneafmefs. If the lime-water makes him co- 
ftive, he may take manna, rhubarb, or fena. It will be beft 
to inject four ounces of warm lime-water into the bladder 
every day juft after making water. To make it more eafy, a 
dram of ftarch maybe rriixt with eight ounces of lime-water 
and be juft brought to boil, and no more ; or half the yolk of an 
eo-g may be mixt with twelve ounces of lime-water for change.

STRENG'I HENERS. Analeptic and ajlnngents are of this 
clafs which I have taken notice of already ; add to thefe, bal- 
pimics AnAjfctaachiti, of which fomcthing remains to be faid. 
Balfamics are hotter and more acrid than analeptics, and they 
comprehend c epka ics as well as antiparalytic>. Of this kind arc 
wood of aloes, yellow fanders, and its tincture evaporated to 
a balfam, ambcrgreafe, amber, benjamin, cane florax, balfam 
of Tolu, Peru and Capivi, Peruvian bark, cinnamon, cloves, 
and all fpicesin general, lavender, rofemary, marjoram, thyme, 
bawm, volatile fpirits, with the efTential oil of lavender, rofe- 
mary, and fpirits and oil of ambar ; thefe are good in difeafcs 
of the head, nerves, fpin^l marrow, ftomach and heart: as 
alfo, in thofe difcafes wherein the humours are thick, and the 
tone of the nerve-, are weakened ; as in the apoplexy, palfy, 
lofs of memory, hardnefs of hearing, and the like. They are 
likewife good when t e llomach abounds with acid crudities ; in 
a bad digeuion, a loofenefs, vomiting, coughs, and in low 
phlegmatic conftitutions. STOMACHICS are fuch things as 
ftrengthen the tone of the ftomncb, and comprehend carmina- 
tives. Thefe are gentian, galangals, zedoary, wormwood, 
camomile flowers, calamus aromaticus, orange peel, the Pe- 
ruvian bark, cinnamon, pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, mint, 
pepper-mint, myrrh, annifeeds, cummin-feeds, caraway-feeds, 
fennel-feeds ; all bitters and preparations of aloes : Add to thefe 
the Spaw and Pyrmont waters. When there is a load of acid 
undigefted crudities in the ftomach, ufe gentian, wormwood, 
fpices ; in a loathing, naufea and vomiting, mint or pepper- 
mint j for a pain in the ftomach, c ,lic, or gripes, fi cfh orange 
peel, or dulcified fpirit of nitre; when a loofencfs proceeds 
from a flipperinefs of the inr.efr.ines, cortex cletttoetiies. When 
the ftomach and inteftines are puffed up with wind, nothing 
is better than the diftiiled oils of caraways and curnmiri; a few 
drops may be tr.!:en on a lump of fugar. 

SUDORIFICS are fuch medicines as caufe fweating, fuch 
as arum or cuckow-pint, a decoction of the woods, extract of 
guaiac, volatile falts r.r,d fpirits, Mindererus's fpirit, the tincture 
of (hake root, dccociion of make-root, camphire julep, all 
diaphoretic draughts and bolus's, and the golden fulphur of 
antimony. Sweating is ufeful in catarrhs, colds, coughs, rheu-

iucceed belt with afufficient quantity of hot liquor. 

TEET H, breeding of When this is difficult, the infant is 
preternaturally hot, ftarts in his deep, cries often, bites the 
nipple, and puts his fingers often in his mouth, tie gums fwell, 
and look white or red, he fiobbers much, and is either coftive 
or has a loofeneH- ; fometimes it is attended with an acute fe- 
ver and convuliion fits. In this cafe, the nurfe fhould be very 
regular in her diet, and the child's body mufl be kept open with 
emollient oily clyfters, and the gums likevvife be anointed with 
cream or unfalted butter, either alone or mixt with honey ; or 
cut a fig in two and apply to the gums, or calves marrow, or 
mucilage of quince feeds with a little of the yolk of an egg.; but 
if the teeth cannot break through the fkin, the beft way wilt 
be to cut the membrane with a lancet, which lies on the ends 
of the t?eth. This feldom or never fails of fuccefs. 

TENE j:\1US. This is a troublefome and conftant defire 
of going to ftool, from a pain in the ftrait gut ; fometimes it 
proceeds from worms called afcarides, which lodge in that part ; 
fometimes from fharp urine in the dyfury and ftrangury ; from 
a ftone in the bladder ; from the (harp matter in a bloody-flux, 
and from the difeafe called the piles. When this difeafe pro- 
ceeds from the afcarides, give frequent clyflers with only an 
ounce and a half, or two ounces of oil of wormwood made by 
decoction. If from a fharp urine, give abforbent powders and 
cooling emulfions inwardly, and injecl: clyftcrs made with oil of 
fweet almonds, poppie-, or linfeed, and fyrup of marfh-mal- 
lows. Jf from the ftone in the bladder, no cure can be had 
till it is removed; but it may be eafed with emollient clyfters' 
prepared with milk, and a fuppofitory may be put up the fun- 
dament of unfalted butter. When from the piles, the above 
clyfter and fuppofitory are ufeful, or the part may be anointed 
with the faturnine ointment. If from the bloody-flux, fit over 
a veflel full of hot water after every motion, or injeft oily 
emollient clyKers. 

TETTERS, RINGWORMS, and SHINGLES. Thefe 
diforders of the fkin, are nearly allied, and are fo weH known 
they need no defcription, only fome kinds eat more deep and 
ulcerate the fkin. The fhingles are fiery puftules that furround 
t!ie body like a belt, and often begin at the cheft. In the cure,

till they are united ; the dofe is feven grains ; fometimes it will 
be necefiary to drink a decoHon of the woods along with 
them, when the difeafe is deeply rooted. Sometimes a com- 
mon ringworm may be cured with dabbing ink upon it pretty 
often i if this fails, ufe the ointment made with precipitated 
mercury ; but above all the tar ointment. In the fhingles, it 
will be proper to fnip off the ends of the largeft puftules, and 
then cover them with the white liniment, to prevent their flick- 
ing to the fnirt. When they are ftubborn the ointment made 
w'uh precipitated mercury may be uftd, not forgetting the in- 
ternals. 

THRUSFI. In this difeafe of infants, there are whitifli 
puflules, or rather fmall ulcers, which befet the mouth, throat, 
and fauces, not exceeding the fize of a hempfeed. The heat 
and pain, not only make the child unquiet, but render the 
fucking and fwallowing very difficult. In the cure, his body 
muft be kept open with two drams of fyrup of rofcs folutive. 
The puftules may be touched with the mucilage of quince 
feeds mixt with honey of rofes. When it attends other dif- 
eafes, that muft be cured, of which this is a fymptom. 

TOOTH-ACH. This is known almoft to every body, 
and proceeds fr<>m a humour which corrodes and rends the li- 
gaments and coats which keep the teeth faft in their fockets. 
The cure may fometimes be effected by taking an ounce of the 
rob of elder-ben ies, and fweating with it in bed ; at the fame 
time gargling the mouth with a little of it diflblved in beer. 
Thofe that are fubje& to defiuxions, fhould drink the mineral 
waters, and if the patient is of a weak bilious conftitution, they 
fhould be mixed with afies milk. When the tooth is rotten, a 
drop of the oil of cloves or box put into it, may be of fervice. 
Jf it is hollow, fill it with a mixture of bees-wax and maftick, 
or a fmall pill made with an equal quantity of opium and cam- 
phire. If thefe will not do, it muft be drawn. When the 
pain is raging, give a dofe of the following pills at night going 
to bed: " Take of the aromatic pills, a dram; of ftorax pills, 
" half a dram ; of extract of faffron, fix grains j mix them 
* c and make pills." Twelve grains of this made into four pills is a 
dofe; or put two or three grains of opium on a fmall bit of flick- 
ing plafter, and lay this to the temple where the artery beats near 
the cavity of the ear : or the juice of the root of yellow water 
flower de luce rub'd on the aching tooth, will cure it like a charm.

A VERTIGO, giddtne/!, or fwlmming of the bead. This 
is either an original difeafe, or proceeds from diforders of the 
ftomach. The former cafe is cured in the fame manner as the 
falling ficknefs, -which fee. Sometimes the fecond kind pro- 
ceeds from long fafting, and then a morfel of bread will drive 
it away. Sometimes it arifes from crudities in the ftomach and 
t! en give a dram of vitriolatcd tartar taken early in the morn- 
ing feveral times ; next give a vomit, and afterward ftomachic 
bitters, with cephalics, and a moderate ufe of wine at meals. 
The wild valerian-root and cinnabar is as good a cephalic as 
as any ; mix equal quantities together. The dofe is half a 
dram. 

VITUS St. his dance. This is a kind of convulfion which 
boys and girls are fometimes fubjecl: to ; it is fo called, becaufe 
they put themfelves into a great many ridiculous antic poftures. 
When they want to drink, they ufe a thoufand odd gefticula- 
tions before they can bring the cup to their mouth ; the fits arc 
generally preceded by a coldnefs of the feet and limbs, or a 
kind of tingling fenfation. To cure this difeafe, firft give a 
gentle purge, then two ounces of the following expreflion of 
hog lice three times a day : " Take of live hog lice three 
" ounces, of fennel water a pint, of compound horfe radiih 
" water half a pint; bruife the hog lice, and then pour on 
* c the water by degrees, then prefs out the liquor j" after this 
give the following ele&ary : " Take of the Peruvian bark an 
" ounce and a half, of the ruft of iron, or prepared Heel 
" three drams, of the fyrup of orange peel, enough to make 
'* an eletfary :" the dofe is the quantity of a large nutmeg 
thrice a day ; befides thefe the cold bath is of fingular fervice. 

ULCER. A fimple ulcer is neither venereal nor fcorbutic, 
nor callous, and requires nothing but to be cleanfed and brought 
to the ftate of a clean wound ; to this end it muft be laid open 
if necefiary, and you muft apply tincture of myrrh and aloes, 
or yellow bafiltcon with red precipitate. During the incarna- 
tion, it may be dreft only with dry lint, when the matter is 
Jaudable ; otherwife a valnerary balfam may be fpread upon the 
lint. If the ulcer is deep, it muft be rilled full of lint, to pre- 
vent the lips from clofing too foon ; when the cavity is filled 
up with flefh, it mav be cicatrifed with dry lint, or traumatic 
balfam, or Fryer's balfam, and a moderate compreflure. If 
there is any proud flefti, it muft be touched with blue vitriol,

or burnt alum, or powder of myrrh, or reJ precipitate, ta 
bring it to a level, as the cuticle advances round about the 
ibre. 

ULCER of the BLADDER and KIDNEYS. The former is 
known from a fetid matter, or blood coining away with 
the urine j as a!fo fmuii pellicles. But if the ulcer i> in 
the kidneys, there are fmall caruncles. The making water 
is always difficult, and attended with pain. When the kid- 
neys are thus affected, there are always intervals of eafe, both 
with regard to the pain, and the difficulty of making water. 
The ulcer of the bladder is very hard to cure, efpecialiy when 
it is of long duration. Rhubarb given to half a fcruple at a 
time, and continued long, may do confiderable fervice. The 
drink fhould be whey or afles milk alone, or which is better 
mixt with lime-water. When the purulent matter that comes 
away is large in quantity, thirty drops of tincture of cantha- 
rid^s fhould be taken twice a day, and if it produces any bad 
efrecls, give five or fix g.ains of camphire. Cherry-tree gum 
diflblved in water and drank is by fome accounted a great fe- 
cret. Others give cow's milk, with half a dram of French 
bole every morning, in an ulcer of the kidneys, which is 
not fo hard to cure, the fame things are beneficial. Some ac- 
count butter milk, when not very four, a .great fecret in this 
cafe. Or you may give a quarter of a pint of new milk twice 
a day, in which a hot iron has been quenched fo long as to 
confume a third. The Spavv waters have been beneficial to 
fome, and fpruce beer is reckoned a good balfamic in this dif- 
order. 

ULCER of tbo WOMB. The chief figns of this ulcer is 
the flowing out of a purulent matter from this part, and the 
greater the quantity, the profounder is the ulcer. When the 
flux is yelloA 7 , vifcid, fanious or mixt with blood, it is a fign 
the fubftance of the womb is vitiated. It is hard to be diftin- 
guifhed from the whites, and therefore obferve, that a fixt pain 
always attends an ulcer, and the matter is always more com- 
pact and fetid. The beft diet is that of milk, which may be 
riced cr mixt with an egg for variety fake : the drink fhould be 
a fmall decoction of Cnina root, and fix drops of balfam of 
Capivi fhould be mixt in every draught, with a little of the 
pciSloral fyrup : or, " Take ground ivy and plantane, of each 
" half an ounce ; of fpring-water, three pints, and then add an 
" ounce of white fugar." The dofe is a pint in a day. ' Bal- 
liimic injections ihould likewife be ufed, fuch-as the following: 

" Take 



Ibe -FAMILY PHYSICIAN: 

c * Take of balfam of Capivi, half an ounce} mix it intimate- 
*' ly with the yolk of an egg; then add fix ounces of diluted 
*' honey of rofes ; mix them all together." When the ulcer is 
fetid and foul, add a little of the Egyptian ointment. Some- 
times manna or rhubarb may be taken to divert the humours 
from the womb. When the pain is great, an ounce of diaco- 
dium or twenty drops of liquid laudanum may be taken at 
night. If either of thefe is not fufficient, increafe the dofe. 

VOMITS, or EMETICS, are of two kinds, the mild and the 
ilrong. The mild are plenty of warm water alone, or warm 
water and oil, or a decoction of carduus benedi"6tus, or a de- 
codlion of the feeds of horfe-raddifh. The ftrong are all pur- 
gatives taken in large dofes, ippecacuanha, gumboge, the leaves 
of afarabacca, the juice of the middle bark of elder, white 
vitriol, and tartar emetic. 

The acTion of mild emetics does not extend beyond tne fto- 
mach, and brings away {limy, crude and bilious humours, which 
are collected therein for want of a good digcftion. Strong e- 
metics in fmall dofes vellicate the ftomach, and the coats of the 
inteftines ; in large dofes they penetrate into the biliary duels, 
the glands of the in(,efline?, mefentery, pancreas, and even 
into the liver, and expell the various humours contained in 
thofe parts. But if they affeclthe whole nervous fyftem, they 
then become prejudicial, and may produce very grievous 
fymptorns. 

The beft and fafeft of all thefa is ipecacuanha given to 
half a dram, and is of great ufe in a loofenefs and the bloody 
flux. The root of afarabacca given in powder to half a dram 
and upwards, is a good vomit in an obftinate quartan ague, 
the dropfy, and jaundice. Three or four grains of emetic tar- 
tar may be properly added to the ippecacuanha to quicken its 
effects : and if you would have a vomit and a purge at the 
fame time, mix three or four grains of this tartar with a folu- 
tion of manna. 

In cafe of poifons, efpecially thofe of the narcotic kind, and 
of fvvallowing the infectious particles in malignant difeafesj as 
alfo when corrupt humours lodge in the ftomach and intefHnes, 
and ftagnating there lay a foundation for flow fevers, quotidian 
and quartan agues, chronic cou^h?, difeafes of the head, me- 
kncholy, the head ach, falling ficknefs, or apoplexy; .then 
flrong vomits become neceffary. 

In difeafes which arife from a thick bile, plugging up the 
biliary duels, iruhe yellow and. black jaundice, and the cachexy, 

vomits 



54 2"^ FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

vomits wil} often cure, when other things have been tried in 
Tain. In the dropfy, anafarca, oedematous tumour of the 
parts, the dropfy afcites when curable, emetics fhould be given 
in a larger dofe than ordinary, and then they will evacuate wa- 
ter from the duels and glands of the interlines, mefentery, 
pancreas, and liver, and carry it downwards. 

Vomits are not to be given in the fit of an ague, an Inflam- 
mation of the ftomach, in violent pains of the ftomach, in 
hyfteric or hypochondriac fits, or where there is a difpofition 
to fpitting of blood, or to too great a flux of the menfes or 
the bleeding piles ; or when difeafes arife from too great a con- 
geftion of humours in the head, fuch as the apoplexy, palfey, 
vertigo, the lofs of fight or hearing ; nor yet in violent pains, 
nor when the patient \s too full of blood and humours, before 
bleeding ; nor laftly, when there is a coftivenefs, and the in- 
teftines fluffed with excrements. 

During the operation of a vomit, the patient muft always 
drink a fufficient quantity of warm liquors, fuch as water- 
gruel, carduus tea, &c. When the operation is over, the 
patient muft avoid cold liquor, the cold air, all hot {Simu- 
lating medicines, and flefh-meats : he muft rather ufe thofe 
that are foft, that yield good juices, and are eafy of digeftion. 

VOMITING. When the matter of the vomiting is phlegm 
from the crudities of the firft paflages, the beft cure is to take 
an emetic, efpecially when there is a troublefome reaching to vo- 
mit, attended with ficknefs and the heartburn. Or, firft give 
half a dram or a dram of vitriolated tartar, to incite the 
phlegm, or a quarter of an ounce of oxymel of fquills, and 
then warm water mixt with unfalted butter very plentifully, or 
a fcruple of ipecacuauha. The common medicine is a fpoon- 
ful of the juice of lemons, with a fcruple of the fait of worm- 
wood. When the patient vomits yellow bilious fluff, which 
proceeds from a bad digeftion, and has its feat in the duode- 
num, this may be cured by gentle laxatives of manna and 
rhubarb. If the biliary duts feem to be too lax, give the Pe- 
ruvian bark, bitter tmc"ture, and fteel medicines. When its 
paflages are plug'd up by flimy matter, or a ftone in the gall- 
bladder, give foapy medicines and fait- water. 

W^hen vomiting proceeds from poifons, give large quantities 
of milk and fweetoil. When from the gout in the ftomach, 
give half a dram of the compound powder of contrayerva 
with five grains of camphire. Likewife, put the feet in 

warm 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. o - 

warm water, rub them well with a coarfe cloth, and injecl 
clyfters. 

Vomiting caufed by a ftoppage of the monthly courfes or 
the bleeding piles, may be cured by abforbents, by gentle lax- 
atives, and more efpecially by bleeding, or caufing the flux to 
return. Giving a vomit in this cafe is as bad as poifon, and 
will either caufe a vomiting of blood, or an inflammation -of 
the ftomach. Morning Teachings after hard drinking may be 
cured by abforbents, by bitters, aud by taking thirty drops of 
the elixir of vitriol twice a day. 

When a woman with child is fubjecl to vomitin?, give a 
fpoonful of cinnamon-water, with a little marmalade of quinces. 
It requires reft both of mind and body, and fometimes bleeding 
in the foot. The drinking of fine foft fpring water will fome- 
times prevent a mifcarriage. 

VOMITING of BLOOD. This happens to perfons that are 
lean and {lender ; women that are irregular in their monthly 
courfes, and when they are going to leave themj men of a weak 
conftitution, who are fubject to the bleeding piles, which either 
ceafe to flow or are too little in quantity. The firft remedy is 
bleeding, which muft be in proportion to the age and ftrength 
of the patient. When the pulfe is impetuous and ftrong, let 
the patient drink the following mixture by little and little, that 
is, a glafs at a time, and often : " Take fpring- water, a pint; 
" of purified nitre, a dram ; of fyrup of wild poppies, half 
" an ounce ; mix them." When there is a pricking pain or 
ftitch in the left fide, add an ounce of diacodium to the mixture. 
To bring the humours downward, give any common clyfter 
with a dram of falt-petre. For outward application, diflblve a 
dram of camphire in an ounce of oil of fweet almonds, and 
anoint the pained fide therewith j if the blood is thrown up 
in great quantities, with lofs of ftrength, makel'gatures upon 
the legs and arms, or dip them in cold water : when the fit is 
over, the patient may drink water in which hot iron has been 
quenched j or, which is better, butter milk, and purge with 
half a dram of rhubarb. 

When vomiting of blood proceed from a fuppreflion of the 
monthly courfes, bleed in the flood, and give frequent clyfters of 
a decoction of pennyroyal and juniper berries : if (harp hu- 
mours corrode the veflels of the ftomach, then give half a 
dram of the compound powder of crabs-claws, and repeat if. 
now and then ; or more particularly ftarch boiled in milk. 
No aftringents or ftypticks muft be given unlefs the cafe is de- 

(perate,

fperate, and then direl the powder of dragons-blood and alum 
fo often mentioned. 

VOMITING *W LOOSENESS. This is a fudden and 
violent purging upwards and downwards, proceeding from a 
convulfive contraction of the ftomach and intettines, caufed 
by a lharp cauftic matter lodged therein ; this often kills the 
patient in twenty four hours, and therefore requires the moft 
fpeedy afiiftance : the cure confifts in giving diluting liquors, 
and the fooner the better ; therefore at fir ft give a argc quan- 
tity of warm water with oil ' r frefh butter or whey. While 
this is doing, boil a large chicken in three gallons of water, 
and let the patient drinK. large quantities of it; likewife inject 
emollient clyfters or chicken broth. If oat-bread can be readi- 
ly got, toaft it as br.own as coffee without burning, and make a 
coffee-c loured decoction with it ; this may be drank as foon 
as it ca * be go; ready, and will come in after the water and oil. 
If the patient is exhaufted, he muft drink a large draught of 
the decocYion as foon as poflible ; and when the naufea is a little 
fettled, two thi:ds of a grain of opium If the patient is con- 
vulfed and the extremities co!d, give twenty five drops of li- 
quid laudanum in an ounce of ftrong cinnamon water, after- 
wards an equal quantity of wine and of the deco&ion ; and 
afterwards the decoction itfelf to qutnch thirft : to prevent a 
relapfe, repeat the opiate for fome days morning and eve- 
ning. 

TJRINE, made too after:, and in too great a quantity. This is 
called a DIABETES, which produces a gradual failure of the 
ftrength, a wafting of body, and a drainin away of its fub- 
#ance ; there is likewife a thirft, a heat of the bowels, a 
fwelling of the loins and hips, and the fpittle i, frothy. The 
Briftol water is very ufeful to cure t;us chforder ; as alfo the 
following whey : " Take two quarts of milk and boil it a 
" little, then add half an ounce of alum ; take off the curd :" 
a quartern of this taken three or four times a day will feJdom 
fail to cure this troublefome diforder. 

URINE, difficulty of If th s proce ds from afpafm or cramp 
of the neck of the bladder, oil of fweet Imonc's, poppy or 
Jinfeed oil may oe g ven inwardly, a fpoonful at a time, aid 
gentle opiates, if th,- difeafe requires them : when the fpafm is 
caufed by fliarpnefs of urine, give laxatives to open the body, 
and the powder of crabs claws, or diaphoretic antimony; the 
dofe is half a dram, the decoction of mallows, or the fyrup of 
n*arih mallows. When the difficulty proceeis from blood in 

the

the neck of the bladder, it muft be diflblved with tea made 
with ground ivy, or male fpcedwel, or with diuretic fait, the 
dofe is from half a dram to a dram : in the mean while apply 
hot roafted onions to the region of the pubes, and give a 
clyfter of camomile flowers boiled in miilc j if they fail, a 
catheter muft be introduced into the neck of the bladder. 
"When there is a difficulty of urine of pregnant women, the 
beft remedy is to eafe the preffure on the part. 

WARTS. The moft certain method of taking off warts 
without deformity, is to diffolve fal ammoniac in as little wa- 
t.r as you can, and dab them feveral times a day with the 
folutionj if you are not impatient, they will vanim without 
leaving any mark behind. 

WHITES. To cure this diforder, it will be proper firft to 
eleanfe the ftomach with a vomit of ipecacuanha, and after- 
wards to take two or three dofes of half a dram of rhubarb, 
with twelve grains of diuretic fait, twice a week ; fometimes 
a prudent repetition of this will carry off the difeafe without 
any farther trouble : if this fails, give the following bolus in 
its room. " Take of rhubarb twenty five grains, of calomel 
" feven grains, of folutive fyrup of rofes enough to make a 
tc bolus:" it is to be given early in a morning, taking care of 
catching cold. If this likewife is ineffectual, give thirty drops 
of the tin<5ture of cantharides twice a day, in a large draught 
of thedecotfion of guaiacum. After all, if nothing elfe will 
do, recoude muft be had to the ftyptic powder as the only an- 
chor of hope : that is, the powder of equal quantities of ro^h 
alum and dragons-blood melted together, from a fcruple to a 
dram of which may be taken thrice a day or oftner, accord- 
ing to the urgency of the difeafe. But care muft be taken that 
the patient has no venereal taint, or that this diforder is not in 
coniequence of the King's evil j for then regard muft be had to 
the original difeafe. 

WHI TLOWS. This is a painful inflammation at the ex- 
tremity of the finger tending to fuppurationj when it is flight, 
it only affecls the fatty membrane round the nail : another kind 
is attended with an inflammation of the periofteum, and is much 
more painful than the former. Jt is often accompanied with 
a fever, and other bad fymptoms. The worft kind is feated in 
the tendons inferted into the bones of the laft joints of the fin- 
gers ; in which cafe the pain will be very violent and caufe an 
intenfe fever, reftlefsnefs, convulfions and a delirium. 

G In 



n8 Tie FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

In all kinds of this difeafe, it will not be prudent to wait for 
a fuppuration, but to lay the part open by incifion, and fo dif- 
charge the confined matter ; in the firft cafe, it may be made 
in length on each fide the nail j and when the periofteum is 
inflamed through the nail to the bone j but in the laft and 
woril kind the incifion muft be made on each fide the fin- 
ger with a lancet, fo as to divide the ligamentary fheaths 
which confine the tendons clofe to the bones, without injuring 
the tendons themfelves. This operation muft be performed 
by one well (killed in the ftrudure of the parts ; after this a fo- 
mentation muft be applied with lime water and camphorated 
fpirit of wine. The patient may be bled in the other arm, 
and take Kpfom fait to purge him ; afterwards the wound may 
be drefled with Peruvian balfam ; but if the bone is foul and 
rotten, the wound muft be kept open till it exfoliates, or till 
the whole bone comes away : the dreffing may be completed 
with dry lint, kept on with a diachylon plafter, and fecured by 
a proper bandage -applied fpirally round the finger. 

WOMB, falling down of. This is a common diforder, 
and fometimes proceeds fo far, that the womb becomes quite 
vifible ; fometimes it is only the internal membrane of the 
vagina : it is very feldom dangerous, for fome have had it thirty 
years. In the cure, firft give a common clyfter; and then bleed, 
then apply white bread and milk to the part, or place the pa- 
tient in an emollient bath, to foftcn the parts : then place the 
patient on her back with her hips higher than her head, and 
her legs quite afunder ; then put the womb back by degrees 
where you find the leaft refiftance, and without any violence : 
let her lie in bed with her thighs clofe and her legs acrofs for 
fifteen days. To compleat the cure, take a fcruple of alum 
and dragons blood, mixt together in equal parts, three times a 
day j then boil two ounces of oak bark in two quarts of wa- 
ter to one ; towards the end, add an ounce of pomgranate 
rind, and an ounce and a half of red rofes : ftrain the liquor* 
and mix it with half a pint of red wine; let the parts be fo- 
mented with flannel dipt in this liquor, morning and evening. 
If thefe fhouid fail* a broad ring made of cork and covered 
with bees wax, may be put up and retained without trouble. 

WOMB 1 , Inflammation tf. This is attended with a pain, 
heat anJ tcnfion at the bottom of the belly, an acute fever, 
and inflation of the belly, a conftant urging to make water 
and go to ftool : when the inflammation is violent, there is a 
frequent fainting, and almolt imperceptible pulfe, and the ex- 

tre- 



Ike FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 99 

tremities are cold, with a delirium and a phrenfy, and what is 
very remarkable, the breafts fwell in proportion as the inflamed 
part. In this cafe, the patient muft live on chicken or veal 
broth ; likewife after bleeding, let her take a fpoonful fre- 
quently of a mixture of equal parts of fyrupof inarm mallows 
and oil of fweet almonds, and inject a domeftic clyfter, or the 
following : " Take of cows milk half a pint, brown funar 
" and oil of fweet almonds of each an ounce, mix and make 
" a clyfter." To eafe the pain, give anodynes or opiutes 
from the very firft, beginning with the mildeft, as fix drams of 
fyrup of white poppies, or half a grain of the Thebaic extract, 
and afterwards twenty drops of the Thebaic tincture, en- 
larging the dofes as occafion requires; after three or four days, 
give an ounce of manna diflblved in a little whey ; but perhaps 
the fhorteft method after bleeding, will be to lay a blifter over 
the part affecled, or as near it as may be. 

Sometimes after hard labour, or from the fault of unfkilful 
midwives, women in childbed have a flight diforder of this 
kind ; and then give a powder made with a fcruple of crabs 
eyes, ten grains of diaphoretic antimony, four grains of pu- 
rified nitre, and five grains of Virginian fnake root, repeat- 
ing it as occafion requires. When there are hyfteric fpafms, 
add four grains of caftor ; likewife it will be proper to give a 
fpoonful of oil of fweet almonds mixt with fperma ceti every 
day, anointing the belly with three ounces of oi! of elder, in 
which a dram of camphire is diflblved. When this difeafe pro- 
ceeds from external caufes, and there is a fever, a pain in the 
groins, difficulty of urine and a coftivenefs, bleed firft in the 
arm, and then in the foot ; afterwards give a clyfier, and then 
lay fome of the following plafter to the grieved part : tC Take of 
" the drawing platter two ounces, of fperma ceti half an 
" ounce, of gum ammoniac two drams, of faffron a dram, 
" of camphire half a dram ; mix and make a plafter." 

WORMS. Children troubled with worms have a gnawing, 
pricking pain in the belly, and fometimes a difcoloured face $ 
they often ftart in their flcep, have a voracious appetite, and ft 
ftinking breath : fometimes they have an inclination to vomit, 
and their mouth becomes full of water: they have often a 
fwimming in the head, or fcratch their nofe. Infants have 
generally a fwelled belly, and void a t ; :ick whitifh matter : 
fome are thrown into fits, others have a worm fever, and fome- 
times adults void worms- upwards and downwards. 

G 2 la- 



i co The FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

Infants who cannot take medicines by the mouth, may be 
cured by the following plafter : " Take of chemical oil of 
" wormwood eight drops, of aloes in powder eight grains, 
*' of oxes gall enough to bring them to a proper confidence :" 
fpread this on leather, and lay it to the navel. For others the 
following powder will ferve in the room or every thing elfe. 
" Take of block-tinreducedinto fine powderafcrupie,ofEthiops 
" mineral ten grains ; mix them." This muft be taken every 
morning in fyrup of fugar or common treacle, taking a 
purge after every fourth dofe, as for example the following 
powder: " Take of choice rhubarb thne drams, fcammony 
" and calomel of each a dram; mix them." The dofe for an

/ WOUNDS without tefs of futylance. To cure thefe you 
muft bring together the divided lips, and keep them in that pof- 
ture; then drefs them with dry lint, or fome mild balfarn 
fpread on lint, to keep the wound from the air. All flight 
wounds may be cured with the traumatic balfam, or Frier's 
balfam, applied with lint alone, without any trouble, and with- 
out fuppuration : fometimes a wound requires digeflion, and 
then lau 'able matter is to be procured by keeping the wound 
from the external air, for then the heat of the part will change 
the extravafated chyle and ferous juices into a white pus> which 
will deterge and feparate the dead lacerated ends of the veflels 
and fibres, that they may afterwards unite with each other , 
and therefore laudable matter Is fo far from injuring a wound, 
that it ferves both to incarn and confolidate it ; though fome, 
from an erroneous opinion of its being offenfvve, are fo fcru- 
puloufly exact in wiping it off, that they retard the healing of 
the wound almoft as faft as it is advanced by nature. In all 
dangerous wounds, a furgeon muft be called in immediately, 
otherwife the patient may lofe his life by unneccflary delays j 
the wound may be cicatrized with dry lint,, or with lint ciipt in 
Frier's balfam. See ULCERS. 

YAWS. This difeafe was very common among the blacks 
of Africa, and has by them been introduced into all cur plan- 
tations ; it appears firft in little fpots on the fkin in all parts of 
the body, which daily encreafe, and become like large pimples : 
afterwards they appear like white floughs, which falling off 
leavered fungufes behind them. In the cure give the following 
bolus every night, for a fortnight or three weeks : " Take of 
" flowers of fulphur a fcruplc, of camphire difiblved in a little 
** fpiritof wine five grains, of Venice treacle a dram, of fy-

<e rup of fafFron enough to make them into a bolus;" di/Iblve 
a dram of corrofive fublimate in an ounce of rum, and touch 
the yaws with a feather, and they will all fall of. His conftant 
drink may be the decoction of guaiac and faflafras, fermented 
with molafles. Afterwards the cure is to be perfected by the me- 
thod of treating the French difeafe, or let him take the following 
electary : " Take Ethiops mineral an ounce and a half, of gum 
" guaiac half an ounce, Venice treacle and the conferve of rofes 
" of each an ounce, of oil of faflafras twenty drops, of fyrup 
" of fafFron enough to bring them to the confiftence of an 
" electary ;" the dofe is two drams morning and evening. 
But as mercurials, and even falivation, often fail in the cure of 
this difeafe, I (hall give the reader another prefcription, which 
is ufed in Carolina, and is faid to be a certain cure : " Take 
" four ounces of the bark of Spanifli oak, two ounces of the 
" middle bark of the pine-tree, two ounces of the root of 
" fumach that bears the berries, of water fufficient to make a 
" ftrong decoction." The patient muft drink a full pint of 
this milk-warm, which will make him vomit plentifully ; the 
day following, let the patient begin to drink half a pint three 
times a day, that is, morning, noon and night, for fix weeks j 
and let the fores be warned fix times a day with the fame decoc- 
tion, till they are healed up, and the patient becomes well. 
He muft abftain from flefh-meat and ftrong liquors during tb 
courfe.

ADDENDA. 



LADDER, inflammation of. This is known by a 
burning, preffing pain at the very bottom of the belly, 
attended with a fever, a continual defire of going to 
ftool, and a perpetual frriving to make water ; add to thefe a 
want of appetite, vomiting, coldnefs of the extreme parts, 
refllefnefs and fometimes convulfions. 

If this difeafe has been preceded by an obftruction of the 
menfes, or a ftoppage of the bleeding piles, the patient muft 
be bled in the foot ; if he is coftive, give him an ounce or 
two of manna ; then direct the following powder : " Take 
*' of purified nitre a fcruple, of diaphoretic antimony fifteen 
" grains of faffron five grains, of camphire two grains, 
" mix and make a powder ;" then anoint the pained parts be- 
tween the legs, with the following liniment : " Take of oil 
" of fweet almonds three drams, of fpirit of fal ammoniac 
" one dram, of camphire a fcruple, of ointment of marfh- 
*' mallows an ounce, mix and make a liniment ;" fometimes 
the perpetual needing, and the difficulty of making water, arife 
from fpafms, or a kind of cramp ; and then boil camomile, 
mallow and elder flowers in milk ; pour this decoclion into a 
clofe-flool, and let the patient fit over it. 

BREASTS, difeafes of. Thofe that give fuck are more 
liable to diforders of the breafts than other women ; the firft 
that I (hall mention, is a rough unequal SWELLING of ihebrea/1, 
preceded with a flight fhivering, and attended with heat, 
tenfion, pain and rednefs ; it is fucceeded by a feverifh diforder, 
which frequently goes off in thirty fix hours; it fometimes, 
when negle&ed, turns to a fuppuration and abfcefs ; its 
caufe is the ftagnation of milk in the breafts : this may 
arife from fudden cold, bad aliment, or change of dier, 
irregular fuckting, and blows ; as alfo from the infant's 
being too weak to fuck. When the fwelling is very great, 
there is a pain in the back part of the arms, and parts adjacent : 
when this diforder is very bid bleeding will be proper, and the 
diet fhouid be thin broth, and thed.nn A lhould be maiden hair ufed

like tea ; keeping the patient, efpecially her breaft, very warm 3 
her belly may be emptied by clyfters, and.a poultice with white 
bread and milk, mixt with honey and half a fcruple of faffron, 
may be laid to the breafts j but above all, the difordered breaft 
fhould be drawn by a grown perfon ; which is the moft cer- 
tain cure ; ir.ftead of the poultice, the following plafter may 
be applied, which is very efficacious : " Take of fperma ceti an 
" ounce, of white bees wax two ounces, of galbaniim half an 
" ounce, of oil of elder enough to bring them to the confidence 
" of a plafter ;" or the following cerate, which is to be had in 
the fhops : " Take of oil of olives a quarter of a pint, of 
" white wax four ounces, of fperma ceti half an ounce, 
<c mix them together and keep the mixture ftirring till it is 
" cold." 

BREASTS, inflammation cf. When the former difeafe is 
neglected, or is not refolved in three days, it will turn to an 
inflammation, and this to an ABSCESS or ULCER. In this 
cafe, fpeedy bleeding fhould never be omitted, either in the 
arm or foot ; and the poultice with white bread and milk, mixt 
with honey, fhould be applied to the part ; or marfh-mallows 
may be boiled in milk for a fomentation, or linen cloths dipt 
in fpirit of wine may be applied hot: when the inflammation 
is difcufled by thefe means, it rarely happens before the feventh 
day. When it tends to a fuppuration, apply the following 
cataplafm : " Take of figs four ounces, of yellow bafilicon 
" an ounce, of ftrained galbanum half an ounce ; firft beat 
*' the figs to a pulp, with a little wine or ftrong beer; then 
*' melt the bafilicon and galbanum together, and mix them 
u well orer the fire." When the abfcefs breaks, or is open'd 
with a lancet, your firft dreffing muft be dry lint, which muft 
be very foft, and the cavity muft be entirely filled with it, 
laying a pledgit over the whole : in a day after this, the lint may 
befpread with a mixture of bafilicon and ointment of gum elemi, 
or rather with the ointment itfelf: over the doffils of lint lay a 
large pledgit of tow fpread with bafilicon \ thefe dreflings 
muft be continued till the wound is incarned and filled up by 
nature ; after this it may be healed by dry lint alone, or dipt 
in Friers balfam. When the matter difcharged from the ab- 
fcefs is mild and fmall in quantity, it will be fufficient to re- 
new the drefling once in twenty four hours ; but when it is 
acrid, or the weather hot, two or three dreflings are required in 
that time. If it fhould turn to a foul ULCER, then cleanfc 
it with bafilicon and red precipitate mixt together, and if it

fhould be deep, keep it full of dry lint, to give an opportunity 
of drefling the ulcer down to the bottom, and to prevent the 
lips from clofmg too foon. 

BREASTS, NIPPLES of, chapt. This difordermay be cured 
by the application of the mucilage of quiuce feed, or with the 
powder of gum tragacanth, fprinkled on through a fine muflin 
rag, or with the oil f wax ; the infant fhould fuck the fore 
nipple as little as poffible, that it may have time to heal. 

COLD, catching of. When a perfon has caught cold, it may 
be cured by lying much in bed j by drinking plentifully of 
warm fack-whey, with twenty or thirty drops of fpirit of 
hartfliorn in each draught; by avoiding all flefh-meat; by 
taking a fcruple of the compound powder of crabs claws every 
night and morning ; in fhort, by treating it as a flight fever : 
for this reafon, a fmall dofe of Dr. James's Fev;r Powder is an 
excellent remedy in this diforder. If the patient has a cough, 
let it be foftened by a mixture of a little fugar candy, with 
oil of fweet almonds, or a folution of gum ammoniac in an 
ounce or two of barley water j or rather two or three fpoon- 
fuls of the milk of gum ammoniac every three or four hours : 
thefe things will render expectoration eafy. 

EYE, blood-Jhot. This diforder may be known by the 
blood-red colour of the white of the eye, which afterwards 
turns livid or black ; it is caufed by a blow or fall, or a violent 
vomiting, whereby the blood is extravafated in the coats of 
the eye : when the cornea is thus affected, all objects will 
appear of a red colour ; but this is feMom the cafe. When 
the diforder is flight, it will vanifn in time without any ap- 
plication ; but when great, the juice of fennel may be mixt 
with a little balfam of Peru, and dropt into the eye; the pati- 
ent likewife fhould bleed by way of revulfion, and take a gentle 
purge, fuch as an ounce of Epfom fait : when it turns to an 
ULCER, mix a little brown fugar with the fapphire coloured 
water of the fhops, and drop it into the eye. 

EYE, white jpeck cr fpot in. When this is fuperficial, it 
always appears white j but when it is deeply rooted, it tends to 
blacknefs, and is fcarce curable. That which follows an in- 
flammation of the eye, generally difappears without any ap- 
plication. To take off this, it is common to mix a little fu- 
gar candy with the water of fennel or eye-bright, or the juice 
of fennel or celandine ; or thefe laft may be mixt with a few 
drops of the balfam of Peru ; when the juice of celandine is 
ufed alone, it will be proper to diffolvc a little gum tragacanth 

in 



FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 105 

in it to (often it ; but the blew or fapphire coloured water of 
the (hops, is as ufeful as any thing, dropt into the eye ; or ra- 
ther the fpot mould be touched with a hair pencil dipt in the 
water. 

EYE, watry. This generally arifes from the weaknefs of 
the lachrymal gland, for which reafon it will be proper to ufe 
ftrengtheners externally, fuch as Hungary water, fennel and 
valerian water ; the parts round about the eye fhould be 
wafhed with thefe : likewife a revulfion fhould be made with 
bliftcrs and iffues. When the nafal du6l is obftrucled, or 
when it turns to a lachrymal hftula, the affiftance of a furgeon 
will be wanted ; when the lachrymal gland is deftroyed, it is 
incurable. 

EYE, a web in. This is a flefhy fkin that arifes from the 
corner of the eye, and at length covers the eye entirely or in 
part ; fometimes the web is thin and white, fometimes thick, 
rough, obfcure and painful ; fometimes it turns cancerous, 
and then nothing is to be done. In the cure, this web or 
coat is to be eaten off by corroding medicines, or removed by 
the hand of the furgeon j the juice of celandine is recom- 
mended, in which glafs of antimony or crocus metallorum 
has been infufed j or make ufe of the following collyrium: 
" Take of the (tone called haematites prepared half a fcruple, 
" of white vitriol fifteen grains, myrrh and faffron of each 
" five grains, of white fugar candy five grains, mix them 
" and make a powder;" mix this with fennel water, and wi,h 
a hair pencil or fine feather apply it to the part. 

FAINTING FITS. Sometimes this difordtr proceeds 
from lofs of ftrength, from profufe bleeding, from a fudden 
fright, from fome terrifying fpeclacle, from long fafiing, and 
from the hyfteric paflion, as well as from a decayed ftrength 
proceeding from other difeafes. 

In the (lighter fort which happens from the opening of a 
vein, from the fight of blood, wounds, ulcers, the cutting of 
a linib, and fo forth, the patient had beftgo into the air, which 
will effel a cure ; but if this cannot be done, hold volatile fpirits 
to the nofe, or fprinkle the face with cold water, or give them 
a draught of generous wine. When the patient is to be let 
blood, and is afraid of fainting, it will be proper to lay him 
on the bed till it is over. 

When the fainting fits are more grievous, apply the flrong 
fpirit offal-ammoniac to the noftrils, temples and pulfes, with 
itrong frictions 5 or give forty or fifty drops of fome frrong 

volatile 



jo6 fbe FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 
volatile fpirit inwardly in water ; not forgetting a draught of 
frrong generous wine, or a glafs of cinnamon water ; likewifc 
the hands and feet may be rubbed ftrongly with coarfe cloths, 
or he may be pulled by the ears, nofe, &c . till he recovers. 

When the patient is hyfteric, things that have a ftrong fmell 
fhould be applied to the nofe, fuch as caftor, afTa foetid a, 
partridges feathers burnt, burnt leather, horn or the like ; or 
the volatile fetid fpirit, not forgetting vellications or fri&ions 
of the aforefaid parts. 

When it proceeds from lofingtoo much blood, from wounds 
or otherwife, it muft be ftopt as foon as poflible ; and {he pa- 
tient muft take ftrong broths, gellies, fpirituous liquors, and 
generous wines. The fame remedies will do in lofs of fcrength 
from difeafes, and from a defect of fpirits and good juices. 

GUT1 A SERENA. This is a lofs of fight when no 
fault appears in the eyes ; the cure may be promoted by drink- 
ing the infufion of male fpeedwel, rofemary- flower-, fage, 
fennel, valerian root, and fafiTafras in the manner of tea ; the 
powder of ho^-lice are excellent in this cafe, the dofe is half 
a dram twice a day, or two ounces of the expreffion of hog- 
lice of the fhops ; fulphur of antimony, given to three or four 
grains once a day, is accounted afpecific: iflues on the future 
on the top of the head, are likewife proper, or in the neck ; 
as alfo cupping with Rarification on the back part of the head, 
by which fome have been reftored to fight in an infiant : a 
grain of calomel given every night in conferve of rofes, has 
been of great fervice. When all things elfe fail, the head 
muft be fhaved, and a blifler laid all over it ; however, when 
this difeafe is old and obftinate, it is generally incurable. 

HE \D-ACH. Sometimes this happens from too great a 
quantity of blood rufhing into the head, which arifcs from a 
plethoric ftate of the body, or from the ufual bleeding of the 
nofe being fupprefled ; and then there is a pain in the whole 
head, which is hot, fwells, achs and looks red, the vefie!s of 
it fwell, and there is a ftrong pulfe in the neck and temples. 
In this cafe, bleeding is neceflary in the forehead or jugular 
veins ; or leeches may be applied behind the ears ; or you may 
bleed in the ankle firft, and then in the veins about the head 
the next day : at the fame time the body muft be cleanfed with 
manna, rhubarb and cream of tartar, or an ounce of Epfom 

fait. 

When the head-ach proceeds from a copious vitiated ferum 
or rheum, ftajrnatin^ in the membranes of the head, with a

dull heavy continual pain, which will neither yield to bleedinw 
or laxatives, then the thick humours muft be diflblved by the 
following pills, and carried downwards : " Take of gum-am- 
*' moniac a dram ; myrrh, fuccotrine aloes, extract of black 
' hellebore, rofm of jalap, mercurius dulcis, prepared cinna- 
* c bar, of each half a dram ; extract of faffron, caftor, and 
' fait of amber, of each fifteen grains ; make twelve pills out 
* c of every fcruple, of which fix muft be taken at night, and 
" fix in the morning ;" they may be repeated every three days, 
and on the days they are taken, the patient muft have nothing 
but thin broths : when there has been a fufficient evacuation, 
the patient (hould exercife till he is in a fweat, and ufe ftrength- 
eners, ftrong frictions, and fuch a diet as promotes ur;ne. 
See diuretics. 

If this fails, lay a blifter of the fize of a crown piece to the 
nape of the neck> with a few grains of camphire; this muft be 
renewed from time to time, and kept running for a Jong while ; 
when the difeafe is evident to the fight and touch, lay a blifter 
all over the head. 

When there is a violent pain fixed in one place, Jay the 
adhefive plafter on the part with a fmall hole in the middle, on. 
which lay a mixture of volatile fal ammoniac and mufiard 
feed. When the head-ach happens frpm a ftoppage of the 
nofe, hold a ftrong fmelling bottle frequently thereto ; or take 
an herb- muff with flowers of benjamin and powder of cloves 
mixt therewith. 

When the head-ach arifesfrom a corrupt mafs of blood, and 
an impure ferum, as in the French difeafe and fcurvy, drink a 
quart a day of the decoction of the woods, in which an ( unce 
of powder of antimony has been boiled and tied up in a rag ; 
J mean an ounce to every quart : this muft be ufed after evacu- 
ations, with the pills abovementioned ; a medicine to promote 
fweat will be likewife proper. " Take native cinnabar, dia- 
*' phoretic antimony, volatile fait of hartfhorn, purified nitre, 
" of each ten grains ; of camphire half a grain ; mix and make 
* c a powder for one dofej" this is to be taken at bed time, 
drinking a draught of the decoction of the wooes after it. 

When the head-ach affects all one fide of the head, the hu- 
mours fliould be carried off by a vomit, with an ounce of 
ipecacuanha wine, and downward with an ounce of Epfom- 
falt ; then give bitters to ftrengthen the ftomach. 

When the head-ach is fo intolerable as to endanger the pati- 
ent's Ufe, firft open the body with a clyfter, then give an 

ounce

ounce of diacodium at night, or twenty drops of liquid lauda- 
num, as alfo a fcruple of cinnabar, laying the following lini- 
ment to the temples: " Take of expreffed oil of nutmegs half 
an ounce, of cane ftorax a dram, extract of faffron and bal- 
*' fam of Peru of each half a dram, of oil of rhodium twelve 
" drops, make a liniment." When the pain is mitigated with 
the above prefcriptions, give a gentle purge ; when there is a 
violent pain in the infide of the nofe, caufe the nofe to bleed 
with fomething thruft up the noftrils. When there is a 
fharp humour lodged under the covering'of tHe fkull, make an 
incifion as in a whitlow : fome affirm Marum Syriacum will cer- 
tainly cure an obftinate head-ach ; the dofe is half a dram. 

JAUNDICE in children. Many infants are afflicted with 
this difeafe foon after they are born, for which the following 
powder may be given in the nurfe's milk, viz. a grain of faff- 
ron with a grain of mineral bezoar, twrce or thrice a day. 

KIDNEYS, Inflammation of. This is known by a pungent 
burning pain in the place where the kidneys are feated, attended 
with a fever ; the urine is made often and fmall in quantity, 
and is very red and flame-coloured ; but in the height of the 
difeafe, watry ; there is a numbnefs of the thigh, and a pain in 
the groin and tefticle of the fame fide, with a bilious vomiting 
and continual belching. 

Keep the body open with the following clyfter ; " Take of 
e cows milk half a pint, mufcovado fugar and fallad oil of each 
" an ounce mix them ;" then lay a blifter to the region of the 
loins ; alfo gum arabic mould be taken often, mixt with fyrup of 
marm mallows : when there is an exceffive pain, an ounce of 
diacodium may be proper, which may be repeated at proper in- 
tervals. This method carefully purfued, will cure this difeafe 
without any thing elfe. 

LABOUR, hard or difficult. When this arifes from want 
of ftrength in the mother, and the child lies in a natural fitu- 
ation, as alfo when the mouth of the womb is open, which 
the midwife is to be fure of by examination, then fomething 
cordial mould be given, as a fmall draught of generous wine 
mulled or otherwife, which may be occafionally repeated : 
fometimes the mother is teazed with falfe pains, refembling 
thofe of the colic, and then it will be proper to give a grain 
or two of opium, which will give her eafe, and nature will be 
able to perform her work effectually j befides, this will open 
and relax the genital parts. 

When 



The FAMILY PHYSICIAN.' 109 

When the genital parts are in fault as being too ftralt or 
hard, which fometimes happens at the firft birth, efpeciallr 
when the woman is not young ; or when the parts are too dry : 
in thefe cafes, they muft be often anointed with frefh oil or 
butter, and the mouth of the womb muft be carefully dilated 
with the fingers. When the Womb is preternaturally clofe by 
fome excrefcence or membrane, or the vagina is clofed by a 
coalefcence, a fuigeon's affiftance will be wanted. 

Sometimes the midwife is in fault, when fhe is for hurrying 
on delivery too haftily, before there is any true labour- pains, 
and before the mouth of the womb is open, which is a certain 
fign to diftinguifli the true pains from the falfe. In this cafe, 
DO forcing things fhould be given, but the mother mould be 
luftered to reft till the true time of birth comes on. 

When the fault is in the fituation of the child, the care of a 
fkilful perfon is neceflarily required to deliver the mother in 
the fafeft manner. 

LIVER, Inflammation of. This is attended with a very 
acute continual fever, and a violent pain in the nervous mem- 
branes of the liver, which is felt every time the patient draws in 
his breath : there is likewife a cough, fneezing, and a fenfe of 
repletion or fullnefs of theftomach, a naufea, vomiting, acorn- 
preflion of the belly ingoing to ftool or making water; the 
breathing is not deep but fmall, and is performed by the breaft 
only, for the abdomen or belly remains immoveable : there is 
a conftant delirium, a fardonic laughter, and as the difeafe 
advances, convulfions. The cure is the fame as in other in- 
flammations, but clyfters are particularly advantageous ; and 
the beft remedy after plentiful bleeding, is a blifter laid to the 
part affected ; the liquors taken inwardly (hould be cooling 
and fmall, fuch as whey with the leaves of forrel boiled in it, 
or mixt with jelly of currants : as alfo tamarinds boiled with 
water or whey. If this method is purfued in time, it is fel- 
dom attended with any danger. 

MADNESS, MELANCHOLY. Thefe are fo nearly allied, 
that they cannot well be treated of apart ; when a perfon be- 
gins to be melancholy, he is fad, deje&ed, dull without any 
apparent caufe ; he is fearful, and yet loves to be alone : he is 
generally, coftive and his excrements are often dry, round, and 
covered with a black bilious humour; their urine is a little 
/harp and bilious, the countenance is pale and wan, they are 
weak and inactive, and vet are often greedy in euting. 

Ttefe

Thofe who are aRually mad^ are in an exceflive rage when 
provoked to anger ; fome make a hideous noife, others ftiun 
the fight of mankind, and others again endeavour to do them- 
felves a mifchief ; fome are mad only at times, and others have 
their raving fit at the new and full moon, efpecially in hot 
weather. 

In the cure, bleeding is the mod efficacious of all remedies : 
open a vein firft in the foot ; in a few days after in the arm, 
then in the jugular, or in the noftrils with a ftraw ; and laft of 
all in the vein of the forehead with a blunt lancet, for fear of 
hurting the membrane that furrounds the fkull, making a liga- 
ture round the neck to caufe the veins to fwell j warm half 
baths are likewife convenient, to derive the blood from the 
head to the lower parts : but before he enters the bath, he 
fhould have his head covered with a cloth dipt in cold water, or 
poured thereon ; purgatives are likewife ufeful, but the gentle 
are preferable to the violent, efpecially when this difeafe pro- 
ceeds from the hypochondriac pafiion. 

Add to thefe the Sellers mineral waters, which is fold in 
London, mixt with a third part of affes milk, which Ihould be 
drank fpring and fall five or fix weeks ; but more efpecially, 
the nitrous deception is of fingular fervice in melancholy- 
madnefs ; the following mixture has cured many people : 
" Take of the leaves of balm cut fmall a handful, infufe 
" them in a quartern of brandy, and then add half a dram of 
*' crabs eyes, mix them;" the dofe is two fpoonfuls three or 
four times a day : fome give a dram of white briony root in a 
quarter of a pint of milk to purge off the bad humours, and 
fome direct large dofes of camphire, even to half a dram every 
night. When the patient is exhaufted, bleeding is hurtful, and 
reftoratives good ; fometimes it will be proper to give a fcruple 
of black hellebore in the morning, and a compofing draught at 
night, which may beufed frequently if not too violent in the 
operation, and then the dofe may be lefTened ; but remember 
that opiates often given, render the patient ftupid : among the 
other medicines, it will be proper to give an ounce of tincture 
of valerian root pretty often, for it is of fingular advantage to 
the head. 

NL'R S E, the choice of a good one. When the mother can- 
not or does not choofe to give fuck, it will be neceflary to 
provide a good nurfe ; her age (hould be from twenty three to 
thirty, for then fhe is in her full health, flrength and vigour ;

child Is healthy, and if it be the fecond or third fo much the 
better, becaufe me will then have a greater quantity of milk; 
if me has already fuckled another's child with fuccefs, it is a 
proof of her ability and the goodnefs of her milk ; but the 
principal thing is the healthful conftitution of her body, for 
on this all the reft depend. Her parents, if known, mould have

weak and inaSive, but able to undergo fatigues, and her hus- 
band mould have the fame figns of health ; fhe mould neither 
be too fat nor too lean, nor diftinguifhed by any deformity of 
the body ; nor yet muft fhe have a return of her monthly 
courfes, which fome nurfes have two or three months after 
they have lain in, which is a fign the blood is not right ; be- 
fides, it will leffen the quantity of her milk : fhe mould moreo- 
ver be clean and neat in her perfon and apparel, that no bad 
fmell may proceed from any part of her body ; add to thefe, 
found teeth, a fvveet breath, a comely face, a lively eye, and 
apleafant chearful countenance : befides, if fhe has an agreeable 
voice, it will pleafe and enliven the child. 

The nurfe's hreaft mould be of a fize fuffictent to contain a 
proper quantity of milk, but not very large and fwagging ; 
they mould be full, plump, fmooth, pretty firm, and free 
from lumps, that the milk may be the better prepared ; but 
they mould not be fat nor flefhy, nor clofe together ; the chcft 
mould be broad and full, it being a fign of plenty of vital heat : 
the nipples mould be of a moderate fize and firmnefs, but not too 
fhort or thick, or hard or grifty or depreffed ; for if the nipple 
is too fhort, the child cannot lay hole! of it ; and if too hard, it 
is not eafily drawn ; if too big, it fills the mouth fo that it 
cannot fuck : likewife the milk mould flow out at a good dif- 
tance, by a gentle compreffion of the breaft, in feveral fmail 
ftreams. 

The milk fhould be of a thickifh confidence, not wheyifh or 
watry, but (hould remain upon the hand, and not run off 
from a gentle inclination ; but if it does not run off at all, it 
is too thick : the whiter it is the better, for when it is wheyifh 
it is blue : yellow milk is a fign of too great a thicknefs, or a 
mixture of bile in thofe fubjedl to the jaundice. It mould be

perfe5lly well tailed, the fweeter the better, and free from 
every uncommon flavour. 

Laftly, the nurfe mould be of an agreeable, fweet, even 
temper, not drunken nor (-aflionate nor melancholy ; but modefl, 
ibbcr and compaffionate ; her diet fhould be nourifhing and 
eafy of digeftion ; flie fhould carefully abftain from all failed 
fmoak-dried provifions, four things, as well as fpices, drams, 
and all kinds of {harp acrimonious food ; fhould live in a healthful 
air, ufe moderate exercife, and avoid the inclemency of the 
weather : fhe fhould be temperate in her eating and drinking, 
and never faft too Ion.;:, or feed to'excefs. The'ecautions well 
obferved, will not only prevent a great many diforders in chil- 
dren, but hinder them from imbibing vicious inclinations, 
which too often are fucked in with the nurfe's milk. 

PILES. Thefe are either the BLEEDING, or the BLIND. 
The bleeding piles are not always a difeafe, for fometimes they 
return regularly once a month, and then they cannot be ftopt 
without caufing grievous diforders. When it is a difeafe, it is 
often exceffive, and will fometimes laft from twenty to thirty 
day?, endangering the life of the patient : the blind are varicous 
fwellings of the veins, fometimes with exceffive pain, and fel- 
dom or never bleed. 

In the bleeding piles, it will be neceflary to take blood from 
the arm, when the patient is of a fuH habit of body, and the 
patient fhould drink cooling liquors with a few grains of nitre, 
and an ounce or tvo of fyrup of red poppies at night ; but 
without giving a long detail of medicines, the patient need-? 
only take half a drain ot the bark every three or four hours. 
If this fails, which it feldom does, powder equal pans of alum 
and dragon's blood ; the dole is half ,< dram every hour : a few 
dofes are generally fufncient. In the blind piles, take half a 
dram or m.-re of the flowers of fulphur in milk every morning, 
till they nre cured ; fume take a fpoonful at a time, or " Take 
' cf lenitive eletary two ounces, of flowers of fulphur half an 
* ounce, of purified nitre two drams, of fyrup of oranges 
" enough to make an eleclnry;" t >e dofe is a dram twice a 
day. When the pain is great, fry ied:s in butter, and that 
will eafe it. 

PLAGUE. This i; a malignant contaiious fever, attended 
with a violent heat, thirft, anxiety, and other grievous fymp- 
toms, together with buboes and carbuncles, commonly called 
j-v-sruie fores; as alfo wiih black and blue marks on the fkin 
iik.- the wales of a whip. The defcripcinn of this dreadful

difeafe need not be more particular, for whenever it appears, the 
alarm is general, infomuch that it is not liable to be miftaken ; 
as foon as ever the patient feels a faintnefs with a pain at the 
ftomach, give a vomit as foon as poflib'e,' which may crufh 
the difeafe in the bud; then pour boiling water on two drams 
of Virginian fnake-root, and when it has flood a little pour it 
offj then put in a glafs of ftrong alexiterial water with vine- 
gar, and let the patient fup it pretty hot in bed to promote a 
fweat: rue, betony, garlick and juniper berries flceped in vine- 
gar, and given to the patient now and then by fpoonfuls, has 
caufed many to efcape; as alfo the following ele^ary : " Take 
" rob of elder-berries, and honey, of each half a pound, of 
" gunpowder an ounce, of camphire a dram; mix them; the 
" dofe is a dram or two." When the buboes appear foon it is 
a good fign, and cupping glafles fhould be fixt upon them to 
draw them out ; or a blifter may be applied thereto : they Ihould 
be opened with a lancet before they are quite ripe, and then 
cleanfed with ointment of gum elemi, mixt with bafilicon. 
Carbuncles fhould be treated with digeftives till the cruft 
falls off, and then with Egyptian ointment ; if they mortify, 
they muft be fcarified and drefTed with four ounces of fpirit of 
wine, two drams of camphire, one dram of faffron, and as 
much artificial nitre made with fal ammoniac and fpirit of 
nitre, for this will diffolve entirely in fpirit of wine : in ge- 
neral, the patient mould neither be kept too warm, nor too 
cold. 

POISONS. There are various kind of poifons, but it is of 
very little confequence t be acquainted with their names or 
nature, becaufe the cure is much the fame in all, except a 
flow poifon to be mentioned hereafter. As foon as a perfon is 
known to be poifoned, becaufe in thefe parts it is generally 
done with fomewhat of a corrofive nature, the beft remedy is 
milk mixt with fallad oil, and taken in quantities large enough 
to caufe vomiting; for they by their foft oleous contexure, 
blunt the acrimony of the poifon, and defend the coats of 
the ftomach againft its effects: when the quantity of poifon 
has been great, the patient has been fometimes obliged to take 
ten quarts of this mixture before it has been all brought up. 
When there is no oil at hand, milk alone may be given, and 
if the patient does not vomit, it fhould be promoted with fome 
squick emetic, fuch as two or three grains of emetic tartar, or 
(half a dram of fait of vitriol : when the ftomach is emptied 
as much as poflible, the patient fhould take half a dram of 

H Venice 



U4 77;^ FAMILY PHYSICIAN. 

Venice treacle or a dram of the confection of kermes, with a 
glafs or two of foft generous wine j as alfo decoction of China 
root or laflafras tea.. 

There is likewife a flow poifon given by the Indians irr 
America, the effects of which are there generally known ; the 
cure for it is three ounces of the juice of plantain, and as 
much of the roots of wild horehound frem or dried ; boil 
them in two quarts of water to one, and let the patient take 
one third of the decoction three mornings together : if he 'finds 
relief, it muft be continued till he is perfectly recovered : 
they will either of them cure alone. 

RUNNING at the NOSE. The matter of this is a thin 
{harp ferum in great plenty, which gradually becomes thick, 
and fometimes changes its colour j it often excoriates the parts 
and at length flops up the noftrils, fo as to hinder breathing. 
Oil of anifeed mixt with barley-flower, will cure the forenefa 
of the parts; as alfo oil of fweet almonds in which camphire 
is diflolved, will do the fame, if rubbed thereon ; the matter 
that flops up the nofe may be diflolved by oil of marjoram* 
made into fnufF with the leaves of the fame plant. When the 
head is heavy and dull, the top of it fhould be anointed with 
balfam of Peru j when the cafe is very bad, it will be proper 
to begin with bleeding in the arm, and then give laxatives to 
carry the humours downward : the diet fhould be fparing and 
temperate ; motion and exercife are proper, and a cold moift 
air bad.
