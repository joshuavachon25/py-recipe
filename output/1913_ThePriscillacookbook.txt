INTRODUCTION 



IT is the aim of this book to present to Everyday Housekeepers a col- 
lection of recipes for cooking which shall be thoroughly practical and 
reliable in every detail, and to suggest the combination of these dishes 
in well-balanced menus for breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, and special 
occasions. Recipes are given for all of the items in these menus which 
are marked with *. 

All the recipes have been prepared by Fannie Merritt Farmer, the 
author of the Boston Cooking School Cook Book, head of the School of 
Cookery which bears her name, and for many years in charge of the 
Cooking Department of The Modern Priscilla, all of which in itself is 
ample guarantee that the recipes are reliable and thoroughly tested, and 
may be used by the most inexperienced housekeeper with absolute cer- 
tainty of success, providing the directions are carefully followed. 

In these recipes all measurements are made level. Measuring cups, 
divided into thirds and quarters, are used; also tea and table measuring 
spoons. 

As a matter of convenience, these recipes have been arranged in 
groups, forty altogether, each one of which takes up a different branch 
of the art of cooking. Directions are given for making all the various 
Fish and Meat Sauces, Salad Dressings, Pudding Sauces, Frostings, and 
Fillings mentioned in connection with the various recipes, and they may 
be readily found by reference to the index in the back of the book. 

In view of the prevailing high cost of beef and other food supplies, 
special attention has been given to the use of the Cheaper Cuts of Meat, 
the so-called Meat Substitutes, such as nuts, cheese, dried beans, etc., also 
uses for Stale Bread, Sour Milk, and Left-overs. Sick-Room Cookery, 
Chafing-dish recipes, and the School Lunch are subjects of special 
departments. In fact, we have endeavored to provide a book which shall 
be a practical helper to the Everyday Housekeeper, and a guide which 
she can safely follow in providing food and refreshment for her family 
and friends.

Cook, without stirnng, two cups 
of sugar, one-third teaspoon cream-of-tartar, and 
one-half cup_ water, until mixture will form a soft 
ball when tried in cold water. Remove from range, 
and pour syrup into an earthen bowl, being sure not 
to scrape the sides of saucepan. Set bowl into a pan 
of cold water, cool syrup slightly, and stir with a 
spoon until white and creamy; then turn on a platter 
and knead with the tips of the fingers until perfectly 
smooth. Make several quantities, put all together in 
a bowl, cover with oil paper to exclude air, that a 
crust may not form on top, and let stand over night. 
This has been found by one having years of experi- 
ence in candy-making more satisfactory than doubling 
the recipe. It will not be necessary to wash the sauce- 
pan between the cookings. It is always desirable to 
make fondant on a clear day, as a heavy atmosphere 
has an unfavorable effect on the boiling of sugar.

less than one-fourth inch in thickness. Cut in shape 
with a small round tutter, place on oil paper and let 
stand over night. If flavored with wintergreen, color 
with red coloring. In the morning melt some of the 
fondant in a small earthen-ware pudding-dish placed 
in a saucepan over boiling water. Flavor to corre- 
spond with the mints. Take up each mint separately, 
lower into the ' melted fondant, and after the entire

Remove from broiler to warm plate, and cut in pieces 
of correct size to fit metal lemon-squeezer. Make 
several gashes in pieces on both sides, put in lemon- 
squeezer and express juice. Turn juice into a cup, 
set in saucepan of hot water. Season with salt, and 
serve at once. Care must be taken that cup does not 
become sufficiently hot to coagulate albuminous juices. 

Beef Tea Remove fat from one pound 
round beefsteak, wipe meat with a 
cloth wrung out of cold water, and cut in three- 
fourths inch cubes. Put in a sterile canning jar,

minutes. Place on a trivet in kettle of cold water, 
having water surround jar as high as contents. Heat 
water, gradually, to yo° F., keeping at this temper- 
ature for two hours, then increase temperature 
slightly until the liquid becomes a chocolate-color and 
the albuminous juices are slightly coagulated,; other- 
wise the beef tea will have a raw taste. Pour off 
liquid and season with salt. Beef tea may be made 
by diluting beef extract with an equal quantity of 
hot water.

Canned Peaches If'"/* *? ^t used for canning should 
-..oMA^,^ M. <;i>vu<.o jjg fresh, firm, of good quality, and 

not overripe. If overripe some of the spores may sur- 
vive the boiling, then fermentation will take place in 
a short time. For canning fruit, allow one-third its 
weight in sugar, and three cups water to each pound 
of sugar. Boil sugar and water ten minutes, to make 
a thin syrup ; _ then cook a small quantity of the 
fruit at a time in the syrup ; by so doing, fruit may be 
kept in perfect shape. Fill sterilized jars, placed on 
a cloth wrung out of hot water, with cooked fruit and 
add enough syrup to overflow the jars. If there is not 
sufficient syrup add boiling water, as jars must be filled 
to overflow. Introduce a spoon between fruit and jar, 
that air bubbles may rise to top and break ; then quick- 
ly put on rubbers and screw on sterilized covers. Let 
stand until cold, and again screw covers, being sure 
that jars are air-tight. 

Wipe peaches and put in boiling water, allowing 
them to stand long enough to easily loosen skins. 
Remove skins and cook fruit at once, that it may 
not discolor. Peaches may be canned whole, cut in 
halves, or small pieces, if desired.

As soon as syrup reaches the boiling-point, skim and 
add plums, a few at a time, that fruit may better 
keep in shape during the cooking. Cook until soft. 
It is well to use two kettles, that work may be done 
more quickly, and syrup need not cook too long a 
time. Put into glass or stone jars.

The Most . 
Helpful 
^ Magazine 
For Women 

There are many mag- 
azines devoted to 
stones, many others 
filled with miscellane- 
ous matter of more or 
less value and general 
interest; but there is 
just one magazine that 
specializes in the two 
subjects most closely 
associated with the 
average woman's daily 
Hie — "Fancy-Work" 
and "Housekeeping" 
— with just enough 
clever, wholesome fic- 
tion added to give 
zest. That magazine is 

The Modern hiscilla. 




tecy-Work," The 

liip^ies designs in 

lontb), with pat- 

and explicit in- 



WHAJL^FANrY.WnmC" MBAWS 

Wlien they see or hear the word "Fancy-Work," many people think 
only of Art Needltwork. But as used by The Modern Prisciua, the 
expression "Fancy-Work" has a much broader meaning. It includes not 
only Embnidery, in all its manifold varieties, but it includes as well such 
feminine handicrafts and occupations as Knitting, Crochet, Laet-makinv, 
Weaving. Netting, Tatting, Basketry, Bead-work, Oil, Water-eolor. and 
Chiina Fainting, Stenciling, Art Brata Work, Art Leather Work, Pyrog- 
raphy, and the like. 

In Tub Modern Fsiscilla space is devoted to aU these subjects from 
time to time, and no other magazine covers.Uiem half so thoroughly. 

WHAT PRi.srn lA r.rvEs 

In connection with what is broadly termi 
Modern Prisolla gives a three-fold service 
infinite variety and of rare beauty (from 50 to II 
tems for those Who desire them. 2. It gives di 
struction, so clear and complete that any woman of avIT^e intelligence 
can gain proficiency in the work that most appeals to ni^. .^. It provides 
a wealth of suggestions for the practical use and applicattbn of the knowl- 
edge thus gained. 

HOW PA«8Hir>W«^ iprr IM 

This last service is especially noticeable in the Faehitm Department, 
where in addition to sane and sensible adaptations of the latest modes, 
the use of the most appropriate embroidery is pictured and described in 
connection with each costume illustrated. 

urwu PPigrniA savts it-S cost 

"iibncB-trbrlt." it will now be seen, at least the " Faney-Wark" that 
The Modern Priscilla stands for. is no frivolous occupation for idle 
hours, but a decidedly itsefid occupation, that will supply at small cost 
many a dainty bit of wearing apparel or household decoration that could 
otherwise be had only at considerable expense, or perhaps could not be 
afforded at all. 

Many a subscriber has gratefully acknowledged this debt to Priscilla, 
more than a few asserting that a single copy has often suggested econ- 
omies amounting to more than the year's subsciiption price. 

HOW A r.nnn mahazinp. was made , better ■ 

Much as can truthfully be said about the "Faney-Work" value of 
The Modern Priscilla, scarcely half the story has been told. 

In 1911 the publishers of The Modern Priscilla purchased the well 
known domestic science magazine called "Everyday Houeekeeping," and 
in due season merged it with their older publication, making what has 
well been called a "DotMa Value tiagaxSme" 

THF. MISSION OF "RVKRYJaAY HOUSEKEEPtNG " 

"Everyday Housekeeping" is now a distinct and separate section of 
The Modern Priscilla, and it is the aim of the editors to make it of the 
greatest possible helpfulness to Priscilla readers. 

Its recipes are economical, appetizing and nourishing, its special 
articles are authoritative and deal with practical subjects, its hints, helps 
and suggestions are gleaned from the experience of housekeepers the 
country over. 

THF. PRICF, SMAtl— T!-'" VALUE UNUSUAL 

When all the foregoing is considered, even the most critical must ad- 
mit that at $1.00 a year The Modern Priscilla is an exceptional value 
(Canadian subscription price, $1.25) and that its steady growth in circu- 
lation from a few hundred copies 25 years ago to nearly 400,000 to-day is 
but the natural outcome of its policy of helpfulness. 

The news-stand price of The Modern Priscilla is 10 cents a copy. 
Orders for subscriptions should be sent to The Prieeilla Publiehing Com- 
pany, SS Broad Street, Boeton, Maea.
