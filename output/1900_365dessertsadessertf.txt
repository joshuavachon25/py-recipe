moisture of the prunes should blend with the 
sugar and form a syrup. If the prunes are

erate oven where they will simply dry. If 
the oven is hot, they will swell, crust on the 
outside, then fall, and you have a result very 
much like the meringue on the top of a pie. 
It is wise to have the paper greased, fitted on 
the board, and the oven in good condition 
before beginning to beat the whites of the 
eggs. After the sugar is added, the mixing
