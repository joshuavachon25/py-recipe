PREFACE. 



Owing to the present popular interest in the subject of mush- 
rooms, and to the fact that there is no cook book devoted ex- 
clusively to them (most cook books having only a few receipts, 
usually for cooking the common mushroom,), it would seem 
■^t a collection of receipts like the one here offered to the 
public would meet with favor. 

The idea of arranging such a book was suggested to the 
compiler by several persons unknown to each other, who knew 
her interest in mushrooms in this relation to the cuisine. 

To my own receipts I have added those collected from 
friends, and from the different books, English and American, 
on the subject. Many of the receipts may be changed to suit 
the individual taste, and if one has not enough of one variety a 
mixture will often make a very palatable dish. I have heard of 
as many as six varieties cooked together. 

I have made no attempt to describe the edible, nor to warn 
against the emetic and poisonous kinds. To do so would re- 
quire too much space, and besides, such knowledge is to be 
presumed. 

I am greatly indebted to Mr. Wm. Knox, President of the 
Mycological Club of Cleveland, for his introduction to this 
book. Mr. Knox's well-known enthusiasm for this subject 
and his kindly interest have been helpful to many. 

K. R. S, 



INTRODUCTION. 



The general opinion in this country regarding mush- 
rooms has been, that with one or two exceptions, all forms of 
fungus growth are either poisonous or unwholesome, but it is 
very gratifying to observe the change that is rapidly taking 
place in the public mind. Soon public opinion will acknowl- 
edge that it is an established fact that the great majority of 
the larger funguses, especially of those that grow in fields and 
other open places, is not only wholesome but highly nutritious. 

The terrible tales of poisoning, so carefully collected and 
recorded in the daily newspapers are traceable to a few species ; 
these seem to have placed a curse on the whole tribe, which 
would otherwise be — as nature must have intended — a valuable 
addition to our food supply. 

The mushroom has been for centuries a staple article of 
diet in many of the countries of continental Europe and 
eastern Asia. It is said that in these countries thousands of 
persons live for several months of the year almost entirely upon 
this kind of food. It is gathered by the people living in the 
country for their daily use and also to be preserved, dried or 
pickled for winter stock. Large quantities are also sent daily 
to the markets of the neighboring cities and sold at a good 
profit. 

No country is richer in this wholesome and palatable food 
than our own, and in no other country is it to be found in 
greater variety and profusion. But owing to prejudice or 



INTRODUCTION. 

ignorance, vast quantities are allowed to rot year after year 
where they grow, while thousands of 'the poor may feel the 
pinch of hunger. What Dr. Badham wrote of England fifty 
years ago could be applied to America today, "Hundred 
weights of rich, wholesome diet rotting under trees, woods 
teeming with food, and not one hand to gather it." 

The value of the mushroom as an article of diet is not gen- 
erally understood. 

Funguses differ from most other vegetables in that, like 
animal life during its growth, they absorb oxygen and as a rule 
give out carbonic acid ; to chemical analysis they also show the 
several components of animal structures and have therefore 
been aptly named vegetable meat. 

It is claimed that America uses more butcher's meat per 
head of population than any other country. But if the people 
would learn to know a few species of edible mushrooms the 
butcher's bill would be smaller and they would find during 
the summer and autumn months an agreeable and wholesome 
change, for while mushrooms contain all the constituents of 
animal food, they have the advantage of being more tender and 
more easily digested. Like animal struotures, they are subject 
to rapid decay, and therefore should be prepared for the table 
only when quite fresh and perfectly sound. If more are gath- 
ered than required for one meal, it is better to cook them all 
wlien fresh, unless they are to be dried and put away for 
winter use. 

Owing to mushrooms being highly nitrogenous they ought to 
take the place of animal food, rather than that of an extra 
vegetable on the table. Indigestion caused by overeating 
mushrooms will be just as disagreeable as it would be from 
overeating roast beef, and the mushrooms will probably get 
th€ entire blame for the trouble. 



INTRODUCTION. 



The best kinds of food may be spoiled in the cooking, and 
mushrooms, to be thoroughl}^ enjoyed and easily digested, must 
be carefully cooked. The receipts for cooking given in this 
book are gatnered from many sources, some being the results 
of many experiments. 

The mushrooms named in the appended list have been gath- 
ered in the vicinity of Cleveland, and although some are richer 
and better flavored than others, still they are all good and 
perfectly wholesome.

SOUPS. 



'Muse, sing the man that did to Paris go, 
That he might taste their soups, and mushrooms know." 
— W. King, Art of Cookery. 



AGARICUS CAMPESTER SOUP. 

(^Common Mushroom.) 
Take a good quantity of the mushrooms, cut off the 
lower ends, and wash and peel, then put in stew-pan 
with butter, pepper and salt and a little stock, stir 
until tender, take off, and chop in small pieces; pre- 
pare a good stock, as for any other soup, and add it 
to the mushrooms and the liquor they have been stewed 
in. Boil all together and serve. I have used the stems 
only for this soup and the following one with good 
success. 



COPRINUS COMATUS SOUP. 

{Shaggy mane.) 

Take a sufficient quantity of the mushrooms, clean 

and peel, then throw in a saucepan and stew with 

butter, pepper and salt until tender; take out and chop, 

then return to the liquor, to which add a little stock. 



10 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

Another way is to add celery, onion, a bay leaf and a 
blade of mace."^ 



HUNGARIAN BOLETUS SOUP. 
Dry the Boleti in the oven, soak in tepid water, 
thickening w^ith toasted bread, till the whole is the con- 
sistency of a puree; then rub through a sieve, throw 
in some stewed boleti, boil together and serve w4th 
the usual condiments. 



BOLETUS SOUP. 
Slice and fry in a tablespoonf ul of butter tw^o onions ; 
to these add two quarts of water a half dozen 
boleti, two cloves, a blade of mace, a pinch of herbs, 
and salt and pepper to taste; when the mushrooms are 
tender strain through a sieve and serve with croutons. 
This makes a very rich soup. 



FISTULINA HEPATICA SOUP. 
{Beefsteak Mushroom.) 
Fry two or three onions in butter, add the beef- 
steak mushrooms, which have been cut in small pieces, 
and any gravy or pieces of meat (left-overs), two 

♦ Almost any soup will be improved by the addition of a few 
mushrooms. 



ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 11 

quarts of water, two cloves, a blade of mace, a bay 
leaf, salt and pepper to taste. This makes a good 
bouillon. By adding tomatoes, celery or other vege- 
tables a good vegetable soup is the result. In fact, 
you may use the beefsteak mushroom in soup just as 
you would a piece of beef. Old dried specimens may 
be used in soups and gravy. 



POLYPORUS SULPHUREUS SOUP. 

(Sulphur Mushroom.) 
This mushroom tastes and smells, when cooking, 
like chicken. Only the young and tender parts should 
be used. Cut into rather small pieces, and cook in 
boiling salted water. When tender strain, and to the 
broth add more salt if necessary, pepper, onion and 
rice, as for chicken broth. The pieces from which the 
broth is made may be used for salad, for which a 
recipe is given under the salads on another page. 



PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS SOUP. 
(Oyster Mushroom.) 
Clean, cut up in small pieces and stew until tender, 
with butter, salt and pepper; and then strain. Mush- 
rooms too tough for eating may be used in this way. 
The clear broth is delicious ; but if one prefer, milk, or, 
still better, cream may be added. 



12 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

WHITE MUSHROOM SOUP. 
(Button Mushroom, Cultivated.) 

One quart of stock, one quart of milk, one gill of 
thick cream, one-half can of mushrooms, and all the 
liquor, or one quart of white button mushrooms, which 
have been stirred in butter, a tablespoonful of butter, 
and one of flour, and a teaspoonful of salt. 

Put the stock and milk on to boil separately; stir 
in a saucepan over the fire, the butter and flour to- 
gether until they bubble; pour on half the milk, 
quickly stirring all the time ; add the rest and then the 
stock. When thick as cream and smooth, put in the 
mushrooms, salt, and, last, the cream. Just before 
using squeeze in some lemon juice or throw in pieces 
of lemon. 



PUREE OF MUSHROOMS. 
To make a puree of mushrooms, take as many but- 
ton mushrooms as desired; wash them in cold water 
and wipe dry ; chop them fine as possible and press in 
a cloth; put them in a stew-pan with a little butter, 
pepper and salt ; let them stand over a brisk fire ; when 
the butter is melted squeeze in lemon juice and add 
jelly broth, according to the quantity of mushrooms. 
Stew until reduced to the consistency of pea soup.

STEWS. 



"That I should live so long and ignorant of such wealth as 
this." — Randolph. 



AGARICUS CAMPESTER STEW. No. I. 
(The Common Mushroom.) 
Peel the mushrooms ; if necessary, wash them in cold 
water; cut off bottom of stalks. Then put them in a 
porcelain saucepan; to every pint of mushrooms, add 
one tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour. Let the 
mushrooms cook in their own liquor and the butter for 
fifteen minutes, then add salt and pepper, and serve 
immediately. 



AGARICUS CAMPESTER STEW. No. II. 

(The Common Mushroom.) 
Peel the mushrooms, and, if, necessary, wash them 
in cold water; cut off the bottom of stalks. Then put 
them into a porcelain lined kettle; to every pint of 
mushrooms add a tablespoonful of butter divided into 
four pieces, rolled in flour. Let the mushrooms cook 
in their own liquor and the butter and flour for fifteen 
minutes, then add two tablespoonfuls of thick cream; 



14 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

salt and pepper to j;aste. Take from the fire, add the 
well-beaten yolk of an egg, and, if you use it, one 
tablespoonful of sherry. Serve at once. 



AGARICS DELICATELY STEWED. 
Remove the stalks and skin from young, half- 
grown agarics, and throw them into a basin of water 
slightly acidulated with the juice of a lemon or vinegar. 
When all are prepared remove them from the water, 
and put into a stew-pan with a small piece of 
fresh butter. Sprinkle with pepper, salt and a little 
lemon juice; cover up closely and stew for half an 
hour; then add a spoonful of flour, with sufficient 
milk or cream till the whole has the thickness of 
cream. Season to taste and stew until tender. Re- 
move the butter from the surface, and serve hot, 
garnished with slices of lemon. A little mace or 
catsup may be added if you like. 



ARMILLARIA MELLEA STEW. 

(Honey-colored Mushroom.) 

Soak the tops for half an hour in a quart of water, 

in which a tablespoonful of vinegar has been placed. 

Roll a tablespoonful of butter in flour and put in 

saucepan, add the mushrooms and sufficient water to 



ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. l5 

cover ; stew until tender. Season with salt and pepper 
and serve hot. 



CANTHARELLUS CIBARIUS STEW. 
(Chantarelle.) 

This mushroom being of a somewhat tough con- 
sistency, requires long and slow cooking. One au- 
thority says, "by soaking them in milk the night before 
less cooking will be requisite." 

Cut the mushroom across and remove the stems; 
put them into a closely covered saucepan with a little 
fresh butter, and ''sweat" them until tender at the 
lowest temperature. A great heat always destroys 
the flavor. Chantarelles may be minced and served 
with meat or other mushrooms. 



CLAVARIA STEW. 
{Coral Fungus.) 
After sousing in tepid water, and wiping perfectly 
clean, the fungus should be "sweated" over a slow 
fire, afterward to be strained and the liquor thrown 
away; stew for an hour; add salt, pepper, cloves and 
parsley to taste, masking with plain stock and dredging 
occasionally with flour. Thicken with yolks of eggs 
and cream ; serve hot.

i6 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

COPRINUS ATRAMENTARIUS STEW. 

(Inky Mushroom.) 

Gather in the white or pink stage. Take a table- 
spoonful of butter, roll in flour and put in the bottom 
of a porcelain saucepan ; throw in the mushrooms and 
cook until tender; add salt and pepper to taste, and 
cream if you like. 



COPRINUS COMATUS STEW. 

(Shaggy Mane.) 
These should be used only in the young state, when 
pink or white underneath. Cut off lower part of the 
stems, peel the cap, and stew slowly until tender in 
their own liquor and a tablespoonful of butter rolled in 
flour ; add salt and pepper to taste and serve on squares 
of buttered toast. 



FISTULINA HEPATICA STEW. 

(Beefsteak Mushroom.) 

Fry a small onion in butter, add the beefsteak 

mushroom, which has been peeled and cut in small 

pieces, enough water to cover, and stew until tender; 

add salt, pepper and thickening, and serve hot. 



RAGOUT OF HELVELLA OR MORELS. 
Pick and clean your fungi and cut in two ; wash and 
dry them well by wiping; then put them in a stew- 



ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 17 

pan with butter, or a piece of ham or bacon ; place over 
a brisk fire; when the butter is melted, squeeze in a 
little lemon-juice, give a few turns, then add salt, pep- 
per, and a little grated nutmeg; cook slowly for an 
hour, pouring on at intervals small quantities of beef 
stock to prevent burning. When done, thicken with 
yolks of eggs. 

The lemon juice is omitted by many, who think it 
unpalatable as well as unwholesome. 



HYPHOLOMA SUBLATERITIUS STEW. 
(Brick Top.) 
Put a tablespoonful of vinegar in a quart of water, 
soak the mushroom caps in the mixture for twenty 
minutes. Take them out and stew slowly for half an 
hour, or until tender, in a covered vessel, adding butter, 
pepper and salt to taste. A small quantity of onion is 
thought by some to improve the flavor, and a thicken- 
ing of cornstarch and milk just before serving is an 
improvement. 



HYDNUM STEW. No. I. 
(Medusa Mushroom.) 
Cut the mushrooms in pieces and let them steep in 
warm water for twenty minutes. Then allow them to 



18 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

simmer for an hour in a pan with butter, pepper, salt 
and parsley, with the addition of stock or gravy. 



HYDNUAl STEW. No. II. 
{Medusa Mushroom.) 
Cut the fungus into pieces and simmer in a little 
water ; season with butter, pepper and salt ; add a little 
cream. When cooked, pour the mixture over toast, 
or saute the pieces in butter; add a little sherry just 
before taking from the fire and serve on softened toast. 



LEPIOTA PROCERA STEW. No. I. 
(Parasol Mushroom.) 
Remove scurf spots, steep for two hours, with some 
salt, pepper and a little onion ; then toss them in a stew- 
pan over a brisk fire with a little parsley chopped fine 
and a little lemon juice. 



LEPIOTA PROCERA STEW. No. II. 
(Parasol Mushroom.) 

Remove the scales and stalks from the young speci- 
mens, and throw each one as you do into a basin of 
water, in which has been placed a little lemon juice or 
vinegar. When all are prepared, drain and put in the 



ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 19 

Stew-pan with a small piece of butter; sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, and add a little lemon juice. Cover 
up closely and stew for half an hour. Then add a 
spoonful of flour with sufficient cream or cream and 
milk until all has the thickness of cream. Season to 
taste and stew gently until tender. Remove the butter 
from the top, and serve in a hot dish garnished with 
lemon. A little mace, nutmeg or catsup may be added, 
but some think the spice spoils the flavor. 



LYCOPERDON GIGANTEUM STEW. 
(Giant P II fF Ball.) 
Peel (discarding all yellow or those streaked with 
yellow. Cut in small pieces and put in stew-pan with 
a cup of cream; stew for at least half an hour; they 
must be well cooked to be good; add salt and pepper 
to taste and serve on toast. 



MARASMIUS OREADES STEW. No. I. 

(Fairy Ring Mushroom.) 

If dry, soak, wash thoroughly, as they are apt to be 

full of grit and dirt; cut oft* stems. Cook in cream 

until tender; salt and pepper to taste and serve on 

toast. 



20 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

MARASMIUS OREADES STEW. No. 11. 
(Fairy Ring Mushroom.) 

Wash carefully, cut off stems; put in stew-pan a 
tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour; put in the fair\^ 
rings, enough water to cover and stew until tender; 
add salt and pepper to taste and serve hot. 



MORCHELLA ESCULENTA STEW. No. I. 
(Common Morel.) 

Having washed and cleansed from earth, which is 
apt to collect in the hollows of the plants, dry them 
thoroughly in a napkin and put in a saucepan with a 
little parsley, salt and pepper, adding a piece of ham 
if you like it; stew for one hour, pouring in occasion- 
ally a little broth to prevent burning. When tender 
bind together with the yolks of two eggs and serve 
on buttered toast. 



MORCHELLA ESCULENTA STEW. No. H. 
(Morelles a I'ltalienne.) 

Having washed and dried the mushrooms, divide 
them across; put them on the fire with some parsley, 
scallion, cheveril, burnet, tarragon, cives, a little salt 
and two spoonfuls of good oil; stew until the juice runs 
out, then thicken with a little flour. Serve with bread 
crumbs and a squeeze of lemon. 



ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 21 

STEWED RUSSULA. 
Take as many as needed, look over carefully and 
peel; put a tablespoonful of butter in the pan and the 
russulas and cook until tender ; thicken with flour, add 
salt and pepper to taste, and serve. They are im- 
proved by adding cream. Some people consider the 
russulas rather tasteless for stewing. 



TRUFFLES RAGOUT. 
For a ragout the tubers snould be well washed, and 
afterwards soaked in oil, then cut in slices a quarter 
of an inch thick; place in stew-pan, with oil or butter, 
salt and pepper and a little white wine. When cooked 
bind the whole together with the yolk of an egg. 



PIEDMONTESE TRUFFLES. 

Soak first in oil, then slice thin, and put them in 
a stew-pan with salt, oil and pepper, grating over them 
some Parmesan cheese; then place in stew-pan over 
brisk fire for fifteen minutes.

BAKED. 



'Nearer as they came, a genial savor 
Of certain stews and roast-meats and pilans, 
Things which to a hungry mortal's eyes find favor." 

— Byron. 



AGARICUS CAMPESTER, ROASTED. 
{Common Mushroom.) 
Cut the larger specimens into fine pieces, and place 
them in a small dish, with salt, pepper and butter to 
taste; put in about two tablespoonfuls of water, then 
fill the dish, with the half-open specimens and buttons ; 
cover tightly and place in the oven, (which must not 
be overheated), for about ten or fifteen minutes. The 
juice of the larger mushrooms will keep them moist, 
and if fresh, yield abundant gravy. 



AGARICUS ARVENSIS, BAKED. 

{Horse Mushroom.) 
Peel off the cuticle of the cap, and then, cutting the 
stem close to the gills, lay them gills upward in a 
shallow dish; sprinkle with salt and pepper, and place 
a lump of butter on each. Cover and place in the oven 
until tender. Serve on toast. 



ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 23 

AGARICUS CAMPESTER, SCALLOPED. 

(Common Mushroom.) 
Make a sauce of one tablespoonful of butter and 
one of flour, and two cupfuls of chicken broth or 
white stock ; add to this the chopped stalks of a pint of 
mushrooms; reduce the same one-half, add a table- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, pepper and salt. Turn 
this sauce into a shallow baking dish, put in as many 
mushrooms as will fill the dish, placing them close 
together, gills up, put a piece of butter on each one 
and sprinkle the tops with crumbs, and place in an 
oven for ten minutes or until tender, and serve hot. 



AMANITA CAESAREA, ROAST. 

(The Orange Amanita.) 
Remove peel and stems, but reserve the upper half 
of the stems. Rinse the mushrooms well in cold water, 
take them out and wipe dry on a cloth. Make a force 
meat with the upper part of the stems minced, bread 
crumbs, sweet herbs, garlic, pepper, salt and a little 
oil. Pack this upon the gills of the mushrooms. Put 
them on a pie plate in a hot oven and continue to baste 
them with oil. Cook fifteen minutes and serve. 



BAKED BOLETL 
Select carefully, as the boleti are the prey of worms ; 
cut off stems and pare w4th a sharp knife, (some 



24 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

even recommend cutting off the pore surface; but this 
takes away from the flavor). Bake with butter, salad 
oil, pepper, salt and chopped 'herbs and bread crumbs, 
to which may be added some mince or anchovy or ham. 



BOLETUS EDULIS ROAST WITH ONIONS. 

As the onions take longer than the boleti, bake them 
first with butter, pepper and salt; when they begin to 
grow tender add the boleti and bake until tender. 



LEPIOTA PROCERA BAKED. No I. 
(Parasol Mushroom.) 
Remove scales and stalks, place the caps in layers in 
a dish, placing a little butter on each ; season with salt 
and pepper. Cover and bake twenty minutes or half 
an hour. Place on toast in a hot dish and pour sauce 
around them. 



LEPIOTA PROCERA BAKED. No. II. 
(Parasol Mushroom.) 
Remove scales and stalks; do not wash the ''para- 
sols," as they are usually very clean; put some slices 
of toast on a well-buttered pie-plate, and with a little 
melted butter or cream poured over them, lay in the 



ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 25 

mushrooms, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and a little 
minced parsley, which has been previously rubbed in 
onion or garlic ; cover the dish with a plate and bake in 
a hot oven for twenty minutes. 



LACTARIUS DELICIOSUS BAKED. 

(Delicious Lactarius.) 
This mushroom requires delicate cooking, too long 
or too rapid cooking makes it tough. One of the best 
methods is to bake gently three quarters of an hour in 
a covered dish, having seasoned with butter, pepper 
and salt. It may also be fried or cooked in a white 
sauce, and serve in the same dish, not taking off the 
cover until ready to serve. 



MORCHELLA ESCULENTA STUFFED. 

(Common Morel.) 
Choose the whitest and freshest morels; open the 
stalks at the bottom; wash and wipe them well; fill 
with veal or chicken stuffing, anchovy, or any rich 
farce you choose, securing the ends and dressing be- 
tween slices of bacon. Serve with sauce. 



BAKED RUSSULA. 
Wash, peel and pick over carefully, cut off the stems 
and save to chop up. Lay the caps on a buttered pie- 



26 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

plate with gills up. Make a stuffing of chopped stems, 
bread crumbs, two slices of onions, a small pinch of 
herbs, a little lemon juice, two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter or oil, pepper and salt to taste. Fill the 
caps and bake until tender, about twenty minutes. 



BAKED TRICHOLOMA GAMBOSUS. 

{St. George's Mushroom.) 

Place some fresh made squares of toast on a dish 
and the agarics upon it; pepper, salt and a small piece 
of onion on each ; then pour over each a tablespoonful 
of milk or cream, add a single clove to the whole dish, 
place an inverted basin over the whole, bake for 
twenty minutes, not removing the cover until ready 
to serve. 



BAKED TRICHOLOMA PERSONATUM. 

(Blewit.) 

Qeanse and peel, cut off stems and lay the cap gills 

up on a baking dish, prepare a stuffing of chicken, veal 

or beef, fill the caps, cover the dish and bake for 

twenty minutes.

TRUFFLES A L'lTALIENNE. 
Take ten truffles, cleanse and brush, cut in thin 
slices and put them in a baking dish; pour over them

a tablespoonful of minced parsley, a very little finely 
minced garlic, two blades of pounded mace and a 
tablespoonful of lemon juice; cover and bake until 
tender.

agarics, fry gently for ten minutes and serve quickl}^ 
on toast. 



TRICHOLOMA GAMBOSUS FRIED. No. II. 

(St. George's Mushroom.) 
Cut the stems off close, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
and place them in a frying-pan, gills up, in fat in which 



30 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

bacon has been fried, or in default of bacon place a 
piece of butter on each cap. Then fry them until 
thoroughly done, when they will be soft all over, and 
appetizing in odor. Serve either with bacon or on toast. 



MUSHROOMS FRIED WITH BACON. 
Take some full-grown mushrooms, clean them well. 
Procure a few rashers of bacon, streaked with lean, 
and fry in the usual manner. When nearly done add 
a dozen or so of mushrooms, and fry them slowly until 
they are cooked. Season and serve hot. 



LEPIOTA PROCERA BROILED. 
(Parasol Mushroom.) 
Remove scales and stalks, and boil lightly over a 
clear fire on both sides for a few minutes; arrange 
them on a dish, over fresh made toast; sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, and put a small piece of butter on each 
and set in the oven to melt the butter. Then serve 
quickly. Bacon toasted over the mushrooms is thought 
by some to improve the flavor, and saves butter. This 
method may be used in broiling any of the Agarics. 



LYCOPERDON GIGANTEUM BROILED. 

(Giant Puff -Ball.) 
Peel and slice in half-inch slices, rejecting all that

are yellow or striped with yellow, broil on a wire 
broiler, first on one side and then on the other; lay on 
a hot dish, salt and pepper, and put a piece of butter on 
each slice ; set in the oven a minute and serve at once. 



TRICHOLOMA PERSONATUM BROILED. 

(Blewits.) 
These may be broiled like the Parasol mushroom, or 
cooked like any of the recipes given for the St. 
George mushroom. 



THE FISTULINA HEPATICA BROILED. 
Some like this broiled. Broil over a hot fire first 
on one side, then other ; season, pour over melted butter 
and serve. 



COTTAGER'S PROCERA PIE. 
Cut fresh agarics in small pieces and cover the 
bottom of a pie dish. Pepper and salt, and place 
them on small shreds of fresh bacon, then put in a 
layer of mashed potatoes, and so fill the dish layer by 
layer with a cover of mashed potato for the crust; 
bake well for half an hour.

MUSHROOM PIE. 
A very good mushroom pie is made in the following- 
manner: Chop a quart of common mushrooms into 
small pieces ; season with salt and pepper, add a pound 
of round steak chopped fine, and seasoned with a small 
piece of onion. If the steak is lean, add a small piece 
of suet or butter. Put chopped steak and mushrooms 
in a deep saucepan with a cover and stew slowly until 
tender. Make a crust as for beefsteak pie and put 
in deep dish, lightly browning the under crust before 
adding the stew, and cover with a crust lightly punc- 
tured.

SAUCE 



"Epicurean cooks. 
Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite." 

Antony and Cleopatra, iii, 



LEPIOTA PROCERA SAUCE. 
{Parasol Mushroom.) 
Chop up about half a pint of these agarics, pepper 
and salt and add an ounce of butter rolled in flour. 
Put in a stew-pan over a slow fire for a few minutes ; 
add half a pint of milk, or, better still, cream, boil 
gently, stirring all the while, until sufficiently thick 
and smooth. Pour around fowls or rabbits or any 
fricassee. 



PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS SAUCE. 
{Oyster Mushroom.) 

A nice addition to a veal stew is to take some young, 
tender specimens of the oyster mushroom, chop up and 
stew in veal stock with salt and pepper. Pour over 
the veal and serve. 



34 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

CREAM MUSHROOM SAUCE. 
Make a cream sauce and add one cup of fresh 
common mushrooms chopped fine, or the same quan- 
tity of canned mushrooms; if the latter, just heat 
through, as long cooking toughens them; if the fresh 
mushrooms, cook in a double boiler for ten minutes. 
Stems chopped fine may be used for this sauce. 



BROWN MUSHROOM SAUCE. 
Make a brown sauce, add to it one pint of fresh 
common mushrooms, or canned mushrooms; if the 
first, simmer gently for fifteen minutes; if the latter, 
only five. Take from the fire and add wine if you 
use it. Some think a little mace or nutmeg an im- 
provement, or a little Harvey sauce.

spoonful of butter and ten drops of lemon juice. 
Cover closely and simmer for ten minutes; add one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne, 
and one-half a cupful of good beef stock and simmer

Take from the fire long enough to cool. When cold, 
roll some puff paste very thin, cut in pieces four by 
six inches, lay on each a spoonful of mushroom mix- 
ture, moisten the edges of the paste with the white of 
egg and roll up like cigars, pinch the ends carefully 
together. Dip in beaten egg, roll in fine bread crumbs 
and fry a nice brown in hot fat. 



MUSHROOM BASKETS. 

Make some puff paste; roll it out very thin; line 
some small, suitably shaped moulds ; fill the center with 
uncooked rice or flour to keep the shape while baking ; 
cut some strips of paste, twist them and bend them 
for handles, bake to a pale brown. 



42 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

When the cases are done, empty out the rice, re- 
move from the moulds and fill with the following 
mixture : 

Chop as many fresh or canned mushrooms as you 
need with a small piece of onion, squeeze to them the 
juice and pulp of a large tomato, put them in a stew- 
pan with a tablespoonful of butter, and one of thick, 
white sauce. Stir until the consistency to eat with a

PUFF BALLS WITH STEAK. 
Peel and cut the puff balls in small pieces, then put 
in a saucepan a tablespoonful of butter or olive oil; 
toss them about until slightly browned, then add one- 
half a pint of beef juice or strong soup stock, salt and 
pepper and a tablespoonful of browned flour rubbed 
smooth in a little beef stock. Stir constantly until it 
thickens, then add a wineglassful of port wine. Pour 
over some freshly broiled steak and serve at once.

stew until tender. Thicken with a little flour smoothed 
in beef stock or water. If liked, a little onion or 
parsley may be used.

minutes in enough good stock to cover them well, add 
a tablespoonful of butter, thicken with a teaspoonful 
of curry powder and a tablespoonful of flour; boil

ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 45 

LOBSTER AND MUSHROOMS. 

One pound of lobster cut into dice. Take a table- 
spoon of butter; when melted, add a tablespoonful of 
flour, but do not brown, mix smooth ; to this add a half 
pint of milk and stir constantly until it boils; add to 
this a pint of mushrooms chopped fine, salt, pepper 
and the lobster; stir until cooked. Serve in cases. 



RICE AND MUSHROOM CROQUETTES. 

Open a can of mushrooms (the French Champig- 
nons) several hours before you make the croquettes; 
drain off the liquor, stew them for ten minutes in 
mutton or chicken stock, drain again and chop. Save 
the soup-stock and cook in it half a dozen table- 
spoonfuls of rice. The rick will soak the broth, unless 
there is more than necessar)^ Add the soft rice to the 
chopped mushrooms, two teaspoonfuls of melted butter 
and the beaten yolks of two eggs, and season with 
pepper and salt. When the paste is thoroughly cold 
flour your hands and make into croquettes. Roll these 
in egg and cracker dust, and set them several hours in 
the ice-chest before frying in deep fat.

AGARICUS CAMPESTRIS KETCHUP. No. I. 
{Common Mushroom.) 
Any of the agarics may be used for this ketchup. 
Place them, as large size as you procure, but not 
worm-eaten, layer by layer in a deep pan, sprinkling 
each layer with a little salt. The next day stir them 
well several times to extract the juice. On the third 
day strain off the liquor, measure, and boil for ten 
minutes, then to every pint of liquor add half an ounce 
of black pepper, a quarter of an ounce of bruised 
ginger root, a blade of mace, a clove or two, and a tea- 
spoonful of mustard seed. Boil again for half an 
hour; put in two or three bay leaves, and set aside till 
quite cold. Pass through a sieve, and bottle; cork 
well and dip the ends in sealing wax. A very little 
Chili vinegar is an improvement, and some add a 
glass of port wine, or a glass of strong ale to every 
bottle. Care should be taken that the spice is not so 
strong as to overpower the true flavor of the agaric. 
A careful cook will always keep out a little of the 
simple liquor to guard against this mistake. 



ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 47 

MUSHROOM KETCHUP. No. H. 

Take freshly gathered mushrcMDms and examine them 
carefully to see they are all right. Wipe, but do not 
wash. Put a layer of mushrooms in the bottom of an 
earthen dish, sprinkle with a little salt, then another 
layer of the mushrooms, and another layer of salt and 
so on until the jar is full; cover with a folded towel, 
stand in a warm place for twenty-four hours, then 
mash and strain through a coarse bag. To every quart 
of liquor, add one ounce of pepper corns, and boil 
slowly in a porcelain-lined kettle for thirty minutes; 
then add a quarter ounce of whole allspice, a half ounce 
of sliced ginger-root, one dozen whole cloves, and three 
blades of mace. Boil fifteen minutes or longer. Take 
from the fire and stand in a cool place. When cold 
strain through flannel and put in small bottles, filling 
to the very top ; cork lightly and dip in sealing wax. 



TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS. No. I. 

Select a number of small sound agarics, as nearly 
alike in size as possible. Throw into cold water for 
a few minutes, then drain, cut off the stalks and peel. 
Then boil the vinegar, adding to each quart two ounces 
of salt, a half of a nutmeg grated, a drachm of mace, 
and an ounce of white peppercorns. Put the mush- 



48 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

rooms into the vinegar for ten minutes over the fire, 
then pour the whole into small jars, taking care that 
the spices are equally divided; stand a day, and then 
cover. 



TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS. No. II. 

Sufficient vinegar to cover the mushrooms, to each 
quart, add two blades of mace^ one ounce of ground 
pepper, and salt to taste. Choose nice, young button 
mushrooms, rub off the skin with a piece of flannel 
and salt, cut off stalks. Put them in a stew-pan, 
sprinkle the salt over them with the pounded mace, 
and pepper in the above proportion; shake them well 
over a clear fire until the liquor flows, keep them there 
until the liquor dries, then add vinegar to cover and 
let them come to a boil. Store away in stone jars or in 
Mason jars, if you prefer. 



MARASMIUS OREADES PICKLES. 
(Fairy Ring Champignon.) 

Collect fresh buttons of the Fairy Ring and use 
them at once. Cut off the stems quite close, throwing 
each one into a basin of salted water. Drain them 
from it quickly afterwards and lay them on a soft 
cloth to dry. For each quart take nearly a quart of 



ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 49 

pale white wine vinegar, add to it a heaping teaspoon- 
ful of salt, half an ounce of whole pepper, an ounce 
of ginger bruised, two large blades of mace, a fourth 
of a spoonful of cayenne tied in a piece of muslin. 
When the pickle boils through in the Fairy Rings, and 
boil them in it over a clear fire moderately fast, from 
six to nine minutes. When tolerably tender, put them 
into warm, wide-mouthed bottles, dividing the spice 
equally among them. When cold cork well and stand 
in a dry place, out of frost. 



'Pray take them, Sir — enough's a feast; 
Eat some and pocket up the rest." 



DRIED AGARICS. 

Wipe the mushrooms clean, peel off the skin, and lay 
on shallow baking-pans, which have been covered with 
white paper; only put on a single layer of the mush- 
rooms, stand in a cool oven to dry. When dry and 
shriveled, take them out, put them in paper bags, and 
hang in a cool, dry place. When wanted for use, put 
them in cold water or milk and bring slowly to simmer. 
In this way they will regain almost their natural size 
and flavor. 



50 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

DRIED BOLETI. 

These are among the most common of the dried 
fungi. Place on a stout twine leaving space between 
for the circulation of air. Some people cut in slices 
before putting on the twine. If convenient they can 
be dried artificially by placing in a not too hot oven. 
Dried either way they may be kept all winter. Before 
using they should be soaked in milk or water. They 
make a good filling for pies or may be used in soups 
or gravy. 



DRIED CHANTARELLES. 

Chantarelles are admirably adapted for drying, and 
should be dried in the same manner as the Marasmius 
Oreades, unless they are very large, when they should 
be cut in half in order to facilitate drying. The 
Italians both dry and pickle the chantarelle. 



DRIED HYDUMN. 

{Hedgehog Mushroom.) 

They should be cut in slices, as the whole specimen 
if large is apt to decay, if dried slowly. 



ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 5l 

TRICHOLOMA GAMBOSUS DRIED. 

(St. George Mushroom.) 

This mushroom is recommended by some for dry- 
ing. 



DRIED MARASMIUS OREADES. 

(Fairy Ring Mushroom.) 
These can be strung on a Hne by passing a twine 
through a hole in the stems and suspending them in 
kitchen until dry. They have so little water in their 
composition that they will dry readily without a ten- 
dency to decay, and the flavor is hardly equaled by 
another. Those I have tried when soaked in cold water 
have regained their natural size and almost their nat- 
ural flavor. 



CHAMPIGNON POWDER. 

(Fairy Ring Champignon.) 
Champignon Powder is good for winter use. Put 
the Fairy Rings into a stew-pan with a little mace, a 
few cloves, and a sprinkling of white pepper. Simmer 
and shake constantly to prevent burning, until the 
liquor that may exude is dried up again. Dry thor- 
oughly in a warm oven until they will easily powder. 
Put the dried fungi, or the powder, into wide-mouthed 
bottles, and store in a dry place. 



52 ONE HUNDRED MUSHROOM RECEIPTS. 

TO POT ^lUSHROOMS. 
(Marasinius Ureades.) 
The small open mushrooms suit best for potting. 
Trim and rub off the skins; put into a stew-pan a 
quart of mushrooms, three ounces of butter, two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt, a half teaspoonful of cayenne and 
mace mixed. Stew for ten or fifteen minutes or until 
the mushrooms are tender, then take them carefully 
out and drain them on a sloping dish, and when cold 
press them into small pots and pour clarified butter 
over them, in which state they will keep for several 
weeks. Writing paper over the butter and melted suet 
over that will effectually preserve them for a long time 
in a dry, cool place.
