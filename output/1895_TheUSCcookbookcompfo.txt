DEDIC-A.TIOIT. 

To Mrs. Sarah M Barnes, the faithful 
and. efficient leader in our church work, this 
little book is affectionately dedicated. ' ft 

Though humble in aspect, may it suggest 
the heart-felt appreciation of her labors in 
theU.' S. C, and the regard of her sincere 
friend, the author. 

ANNA M. SCOTT. 







)T a certain luncheon party, our hostess, Mrs. Smith, 
being- complimented upon the excellence of her 
^$$$ viands, took occasion to give us some of her early 
experience in cooking 

"Soon after our marriage," said she, "My husband met 
with crushing losses in business, and in consequence was 
greatly depressed in spirits. With true loyalty to our busi- 
ness firm, I hailed the opportunity to show my heroism as a 
good, economical wife. I resolved on sudden retrenchment 
in household expenses. One item had troubled me from 
the first. Our housekeeper was wasteful and careless. Her 
miserable cooking had kept my husband longing for his 
mother's old fashioned living. This added, I knew, to his 
gloominess; for I never found anyone so dependent as Mr. 
Smith on having just what he wanted to eat. An inspira- 
tion seized me It was the hope of snatching my husband 
from ruin. I determined he should have some of his favor- 
ite dishes every day. This would revive his spirits and 
turn the financial scale. To this end I turned off the cook, 
and resolved that very day to give Mr. Smith some of his 
favorite peach pie. 

"I went to the kitchen in search of the old receipt book. 
Alas! it was gone. The cook had taken her own, for as I 
remembered I had given her the book Without repining, 
I rallied to meet the situation I could make pies without 
a receipt book. Of course I could I had seen my mother- 
in-law cook everything. Let's see! Peach pie? Tt is not 
peach season Apple pie? That is nice, and here are dried 
apples. How white and beautiful ! What delicious pie 
they will make. In a jiffy the crust was rolled and laid 
smoothly, then the rings of white evaporated apples spread 
carefully, then a coating of sugar with flour dredged over 
it. I was almost sure this was mother's formula before 

[9] 



10 U. S. C. COOK BOOK. 

putting on the top crust. Full of confidence the pie went 
into the oven. I served it at dinner with due formality. 
But to m}' chagrin, the pie was so tough and hard that it 
could not be eaten at all. Now as if the fates had planned 
a climax to my mortification, who do you suppose dropped 
in just at the hour of this unfortunate dinner? My mother- 
in-law ! And when I told her of the dried apples placed 
between crusts without being first cooked, she laughed till 
the tears rolled down her cheeks. 

"That apple pie incident remains a standing joke in our 
family yet. But I came out victorious at last, and it was 
by getting hold of a good cook book. One gotten up by 
Kansas women, who are scientific cooks." 

In the receipts which this U. S. C. Cook Book contains, 
there is nothing but what has been tried by persons whose 
names are appended. Each one has been tested at home, 
where the substantial dishes as well as the delicacies have 
been enjoyed. The excellence of many of the viands has 
become known to the public through various social channels 
when banquets and entertainments were given. After such 
occasions noted successes are referred to as Mrs. J. C. 
Scott's pie crust, Mrs Baskin's white citron cake, or Mrs. 
Crail's graham pudding, etc , etc. 

Many wishing to know how such and such favorites 
were prepared, have asked for various receipts. This evi- 
dent demand for practical directions has suggested their 
publication in the pages that follow. Doubtless an ap- 
preciative public will readily discover that much pains has 
been taken to collect and arrange this useful information, 
and will extend liberal patronage as a just reward. 

Note how minutely the necessary details are given in 
regard to preparation of ingredients as also quantity and 
kind. Read, if you please, as a specimen, the receipt for 
"chow chow" in the pickle department. The directions are 
so explicit in this little book that if well followed there is 
no chance for blunder, such as the pie story illustrates.

Shake thoroughly, then put in about equal quantities of 
strawberries, raspberries, cherries, (stonedl peaches (cut in 
small pieces i also pine apple (shredded). Other varieties of 
fruit may be added. This operation may be commenced 
early in the season, and in order to preserve the propor- 
tions, one may put in a one half pound each of the different 
fruits, and in this way it will be easier to keep track of the 
proportions which must not vary. Add one half pound of 
sugar and one half pound of fruit at the same time. 

More alcohol will not be needed unless a large amount 
of fruit is added —say five pounds - after which another pint 
may be put in, or one quart, if there are signs of fermenta- 
tion Care should be taken in opening the jar to add fruits 
as they ripen, that the cover is replaced as soon as possible. 

Keep the jar in a cool place and in the dark. This 
preserve is excellent with cold meats or poultry, or used in 
the same way as cranberry sauce. Mrs. W. W. Baskix.

an egg. Cut to fit inside of glasses on top of jelly to 
exclude the air. Tie cloth over top. Evelyn B. Davis. 



153 MACARONI. 

Break the macaroni into strongly salted boiling water. 
Boil forty-five minutes. The secret of cooking macaroni is 
to have the water boiling and keep it boiling until taken 
from the fire. Then drain immediately and put into greased 
baking dish a layer of macaroni, followed by a layer of 
grated cheese alternate, until the dish is full, having a thick 
layer of cheese on top. Place in a quick oven and let bake 
twenty minutes or until brown. EVELYN B. DAVIS.

A HYGIENIC DINNER. 



Riding in Philadelphia one morning, I observed a sign 
over the front door of a large brick mansion. 

WATER-GORE AND BOARDING HOUSE. 

The name was that of the greatest of Hygienic physic- 
ians, whom I had long wished to meet. I leaped from the 
car, rang the bell, audaciously determined to have a chat 
with the wonderful man, who could persuade thousands of 
people, both sick and well, to forego their accustomed table 
luxuries, for the sake of good bodily and mental health. 

1 hardly knew what gustatory enjoyments the disciples 
of that extremist might have ; albeit 1 had spent several 
years at water cures and other sanitariams (not lunatic asy 
lums); but I was determined to find out. 

Asking for Dr. Trail I was conducted to a slender lady, 
not yet thirty, of very attractive appearance "lam Dr. 
Trails daughter in-law, ' she said ; and this is a branch of 
his large cure. It followed that I received an urgent invi- 
tation to spend an entire day with the charming doctor, be 
initiated as to her system of water treatment and — eat a 
Hygienic dinner! You will have, therefore, in this article, 
directions for preparing certain kinds of food after the 
strictest so called Hygienic methods. Wide experience 
and much observation of invalids (there were a thousand at 
once in Clifton Sanitariam where I have spent much time) 
lead me to indorse these preparations heartily for dyspep- 
tics. Even people supposed to be in health, by adopting a 
similar but less severe clietectic system, will be less subject 
to head aches, billious attacks, and that lassitude which is 
likely to be caused by impeded digestion and imperfect 
assimilation. 

Imprimis: Dr. Trail wholly discards animal food, not 
even allowing fish, eggs or milk (except for babes). Full- 
fed persons are often much benefitted by a temporary 
adoption of this plan ; although there are undoubtedly many 



MISCELLANEOUS. 87 



who crave or constitutionally demand flesh and kindred food. 

Secundus : Dr. Trail, perceiving that far too much use 
is made of salt, to the injury especially of the scrofulous 
and impure blooded, pulls the other way, and denies that 
the human system has any use for it. 

Terttus : He objects to sugar made from sap and the 
juice of the cane, claiming that until nature has fully elab- 
orated her saccharine material so that it has become organ- 
ized and embodied in grains, fruits, etc., it is not worthy to 
build up the perfect man and woman. Moreover he insists 
that nature prepares nutrition in due PROPORTION, and that 
when we add pure sugar (or impure rather),- we are getting 
just so much more than the human system requires. In this 
last sense, he is probably nearly or quite correct. 

Understanding what deprivations awaited me, I sat 
down to my Hygienic dinner (after the most hunger pro- 
voking bath I ever had) feeling that even I, nine tenths 
vegetarian by nature, would fail to be satisfied. At the 
tables were many business men of apparently large intelli- 
gence and good health, who of choice had for years followed 
the course of feeding prescribed by Dr. Trail. 

One strict rule is to drink shortly before meals, but 
never during them, or within three hours thereafter. Some 
concession was made in the way of soup, of which here and 
there, one partook. 

Green corn scraped, rather than cut from the cob was 
cooked in a little water. To this was added tomatoes which 
had been cooked and passed through a colander, the whole 
being boiled and rapidly stirred till thoroughly commingled. 
•No salt! Although I should have pronounced such a mix- 
ture unhygienic, it no way interfered with my digestion, 
and was quite as palatable as our fashionable tomato-bisque 
which is prepared in the same way, substituting milk for 
corn, and adding salt. 

Vegetables and legumes naturally took the place of 
meat, — roasted Irish potatoes, roasted and boiled yams, 
sliced beets (without vinegar) tenderly cooked cauliflower, 
turnips, boiled carrots, afterward nicely browned) and salad 
dressed with olive oil and flavored with sweet herbs; best 
of all, baked Hubbard squash ! Not so much as a pinch of 
salt anywhere ! But though I am fond of salt, I now per- 
ceived for the first time the true delicacy of vegetable food, 
and the peculiar self-flavor which makes each kind enjoy- 



88 U. S. 0. COOK BOOK. 

able unadulterated. There was all the difference between 
smelling flowers separately or together. The keener sense 
prefers the former. 

These were cooked with elaborate care. The baked 
potatoes and yams were squeezed open when taken from 
the oven so that no condensing steam could make them 
soggy The boiled beans— at least the Lima and T think 
the Navy also, were cooked in but one water, which was 
allowed to almost wholly evaporate, so that they were serv- 
ed nearly dry with all their rich qualities conserved. They 
were the best I ever ate. 

Meantime the breadstuff* were mostly novel. No fer- 
mented bread was allowed, nor any prepared of white flour 
alone, except by special prescription. First of all the true, 
original Graham gems —so named because of precious value 
as food ! Trust no recipe but this for gems ! 

Perfect Graham flour, not too finely ground, and con- 
taining all the bran — that is the first requirement! Next, a 
set of cast iron cup pans— tin will not do ; then a strong, 
steady fire, much hotter than is required for bread. Put 
your pans in to heat Then beat the flour rapidly and 
lightly into cold water ; (never pour the water on the flour) 
until the dough is nearly as thick as ordinary pancake 
dough. It must run, not drop, from the spoon. Fill the 
cups nearly level — (they must be hissing hot and will need 
but the merest touch of butter), and bake twenty minutes 
before opening the oven door. They will probably require 
ten minutes longer to be thoroughly done. The hot iron 
sears the bottom at once, the upper heat soon sears the top, 
and fast as the water within is converted into steam, which 
cannot escape, it separates their particles so that they turn 
out very light. I have fed chiefly on Graham gems (more 
or less perfect according to conditions) more than thirty 
years — and still live ! No other bread compares with them. 

The Graham finger rolls were however preferred at Dr. 
Trail's table, and at one cure where I spent some time. 
Pour boiling water on Graham flour, stirring until the 
dough is of sufficient consistency to roll in the hands. Add 
flour as you roll, and make them in size about as the name 
indicates, baking them brown in a fairly hot oven. 

Old fashioned granular oatmeal was handed me, made 
into bread prepared after an original method by Miss Julia 
Coleman, professor of dietectics under Dr. Trail. I have 



A HYGIENIC DINNER. 89 



the recipe with others directly from Miss Coleman, who is a 
personal friend To one cup of oatmeal take three cups ot 
cold water. Grease a hot cast iron spider lightly with but- 
ter pour in the mixture, set on top of the stove, cover close 
and let it slowly bake twenty minutes; then uncover and 
bake till somewhat browned. This is incomparably better 
than the old Scotch oatmeal yeast cakes. 

Dr Trail's objection to fermented bread, amounts to 
this: The yeast germ feeds upon an essentially nutritive 
property of the grain, and wholly destroys it. The grain as 
the Lord made it is right; any chemical alteration or pro- 
cess of destruction makes it wrong. . 

If the reader ever chewed wheat, he has some idea ot 
its delicate sweetness All grains, unrobbed and unadulter- 
ated, properly cooked, eaten without salt, are delicious, and 
form the most perfect food of man. 

When, at our dinner, we were well through with the 
solids, I had so thoroughly enjoyed the meal that I could 
eat little more without a disagreeable sense of sturhng 
Still I was there to learn, even at some cost In addition 
they serve various mushes of oatmeal, graham rye mea, 
barley meal (best of all), golden millet buck-whea meal, 
corn-meal, with coarser preparations of Scotch ^oat^pio- 
nounced groutsY samp and hominy. Also German gieen 
corn-being whole grains of rye, cut while unripe, and 
almost equal to American green corn. 

Miss 1 Coleman's general rule for mushes is to use one 
part meal to four parts water, stim-ng it in slowly, never 
Sfbwin* the water to stop boiling; then set back where 
they will slowly bubble without burning for four hours 
They are not to be stirred after once made. You who pre- 
pare mush just before meal time, know nothing of its super- 

lative excellence , ... . • 

We ate ours without cream, but some used fruit-juice 
(any kind will do) slightly thickened to give it body. Am

crust, it was made of Graham flour and it was tender, being 
shortened with old fashioned granulated oatmeal. My 
mother, humoring mv dyspepsia, used sometimes to sift a 
thin layer of cornmeal over a pie-tin, for pumpkin or cust- 
ard pies, and if well baked, 1 ask no better crust. 

To end our Hygienic dinner we were given fruits and 
nuts. Of all the food (which as you see was in unusual 
variety) nothing could have disturbed a delicate digestion, 
unless the diner had eaten both fruit and vegetables which 
together tend to create fermentation. With vegetables i 
do not class tomatoes, corn (unless very green), beans, peas 
or any leguminous food. 

Above all things, eat your Hygienic food slowly and 
reverentlv, taking moderate mouthfuls and appreciating the 
delicate flavors brought out only by thorough mastication. 
A\n], when you have ended, thank God for a good dinner.
