DeMcate^ to 

The Old Memories which this Book will recall of the Hospitable 
Homes of the North and the South. 



INTRODUCTION- 



INTRODUCTION. 

The title of this book by itself conveys so much that any intro- 
duction to the many good things told in its pages seems superfluous. 
It certainly should not require any urging to induce all who can to 
read, mark, learn and inwardly digest them. 

" One hundred years ago and more " brings before us a delightful 
period in our country's history, and recalls the generous, cordial feel- 
ings which prevailed among our ancestors — that " open-handed spirit, 
irank and blythe, of ancient hospitality," which made the homes of the 
New World all that a stranger could desire. 

We may reconcile ourselves to the passing of " the fugaceous 
hospitalities of the snuffbox " as needing the powdered wig and three- 
cornered hat to justify them. What a genuine ring there is in the 
words of Washington, referring to Mount Vernon, when he said : 
" T.et the hospitality of the house with respect to the poor be kept up; 
let no one go hungry away." And the cordiality of Jefferson while 
living in Philadelphia is delightfully expressed in a letter to Richard 
Peters: "Call on me whenever you come to town, and if it should 
be about the hour of three, I shall rejoice the more. You will find a 
bad dinner, a good glass of wine, and a host thankful for your favour 
and desirous of encouraging repetitions of it, wathout number, form, 
or ceremony." 

It was a time when there was truly that " hospitality sitting with 
gladness," w-hich all the luxuries of the present day cannot supply. 

Athenaeus, as early as the Third century, held that " Every inves- 
tigation which is guided by principles of nature fixes its ultimate aim 
entirely on gratifying the stomach." And Dr. Johnson, in simpler 
phrase, confirms Athen?eus when he says : " I look upon it that he 

15 



i6 FAMOUS OLD RECEIPTS 

who does not mind his belly will hardly mind anything else." This 
volume would appeal to both philosophers. 

The sources of the recipes add greatly to their value and interest. 
Though described as coming from " the kitchen," they were the work 
of as gentle dames as ever graced a court. 

It is a sad error to suppose that the homely accomplishments of 
housewives, deemed essential at the end of the eighteenth and begin- 
ning of the nineteenth centuries in this country, are no longer impor- 
tant. A hundred years ago so much could be left to faithful serv^ants 
that even less was required of the heads of households than now. 
There are, alas! no more of those loyal, devoted, if humble, members 
of the family circle who, in wealth and health or in trouble, never 
failed to supply the comforts and maintain the dignity of the old 
homes. To-day even in England or Scotland a Caleb Balderston 
would be hard to find, and the colored " Aunties " have disappeared 
under the changed conditions at the South. 

The character of the hospitality at the North differed from that 
at the South, especially in the rural sections. In the North the well- 
kept inns to be found on many of the principal roadways supplied 
what the roof of the planter generously offered to the traveler in the 
Southern States. " The spare room " provided in a Northern home 
had little meaning to the Southerner, whose every room was always a 
guest chamber, if necessary, for the welcome of one coming to his 
door. The tables of the North could, however, vie with those of the 
South, and, within the recollection of many now living, Christmas 
dinners rivaled in their generous profusion such a feast as Pepys 
lovingly records as " most neatly dressed by our owm only mayde." 
" We had a fricassee of rabbits and chickens, a leg of mutton boiletl. 
three carps in a dish, a great dish of a side of lamb, a dish of roasted 
pigeons, a dish of four lobsters, three tarts, a lamprey pie, — a most 
rare pie, — a dish of anchovies, good wine of several sorts, and all 
things mighty noble to my heart's content." 

Prior to the year 1800, perhaps, the best social conditions in the 
North were to be found in Philadelphia. Society, naturally, became 



INTRODUCTION 17 

more cosmopolitan there, as it was the seat of government; and the 
foreign ministers preferred Philadelphia, even after the removal of 
the capital to Washington. That city, which the Abbe Correa wittily 
described as " the city of magnificent distances," presented few attrac- 
tions in its early days. Distinguished visitors from abroad, attracted 
by the novelty of the new country, and later many who were driven 
away by the French Revolution, gave additional variety and attractive- 
ness to Philadelphia society. Many of the houses built with a view 
to entertaining w'ere spacious and luxurious. Balls and dinners were 
frequent. The very w-omen wdiose hands recorded the dainty dishes 
herein described, by their brilliancy and beauty established the repu- 
tation for charm which American women have sustained ever since. 

This is not the place to describe in detail these centres of social 
interest, though a fcAv may be mentioned. 

At the house of Tench Francis and his wife, who was Anne 
Willing, both before and after the Revolution could be met the most 
cultivated and interesting people. Distinguished foreigners and vis- 
itors from all parts of the country were included in their receptions, 
and it became a delightful Salon. 

The large mansion and gardens of William Bingham, Senator of 
the United States, whose wife was also a Miss Willing, continued, 
while they lived, to be the scene of many entertainments. Frequent 
mention of them is made in the published memoirs of persons wlio 
visited America at that time. 

Among many others, the homes of Chief Justice Chew, Robert 
Morris, Samuel Powell — whose wife has contributed to the receipts 
given in this volume — Governor Hamilton, whose beautiful house and 
park, " The W^oodlands," still remains, though converted into a ceme- 
tery; George Harrison, General John Cadwalader, and later his son. 
General Thomas Cadwalader, Richard Peters and Alexander Wilcocks 
may be named. These were all centres of social influence. In addi- 
tion to private influence, society at the period referred to was largely 
controlled by certain associations, which in some instances continue to 
the present day. " The State in Schuylkill." known generally as " The 



]8 FAMOUS OLD RECEIPTS 

Fish House," was formed in 1732, and is still conducted under the 
same constitution and rules. It is believed to be the earliest incor- 
porated body of its kind existing anywhere. Its government is formed 
upon that of a State, with a governor and other officers. The new 
members are taken as apprentices and are trained to be expert cooks. 

An incident occurred to Tench Francis, already mentioned, when 
he was in England, that showed the value of his Fish House training. 
Mr. Francis had been detained in England for two years waiting to 
have a case vitally affecting his interests heard by the Lord Chancellor. 
When almost in despair a lady friend said that Lord Camden was a 
bon vivant, and if Mr. Francis would prepare the turtle she would 
invite the Lord Chancellor and himself to dine. At dinner she would 
announce to whose good offices his lordship owed his favorite dish. 
and then ask the favor in return. The dinner was given, the turtle 
was prepared. The Lord Chancellor was charmed both by his hostess 
and the turtle, ordered the hearing for the following Thursday, and 
forthwith decided the case in Mr. Francis's favor. 

Fish House punch might also have been provided, for that bever- 
age was celebrated then and is still a delightful compound for those 
who can stand it. But the Dabney mint julep is far better. 

The Wistar party, composed of members of The American Philo- 
sophical Society, is another social function of a century's existence 
which still brings together, every fortnight, at the houses of its mem- 
bers, the scientific, literary and professional world. To these may be 
added " The Assemblies," which have continued since 1740. It is not 
probable that any similar social organization has endured so long. 
except the St. Cecilia, of Charleston, South Carolina, a similar organi- 
zation, of which the Charleston Gazette of November 5. 1737, records 
the first meeting on Queen street, Thursday, the 12th, 1737. These 
balls are still of great interest, and with the increase in the social world 
the anxiety to secure invitations is extreme. It might serve a good 
purpose to give to the public a fuller insight into what really consti- 
tuted society in the days when our country was young. While there 
was a simplicity in one sense, there was true dignity, much cultivation, 



INTRODUCTION 19 

and a substantial character totally lacking- to-day. It is deplorable if 
the authoress of the introduction to Fads and Fancies is right when 
she declares that " We cannot gainsay the fact that wealth and the 
power it brings rule supreme in our land, . . . and to this decree 
of the people American society has bowed down obediently." 

Even in New York, which is assumed by the writer of the quoted 
words to be the controlling centre of social influence to-day, it is to be 
hoped there still exists a higher plane of thought w'hich does not rest 
upon " the golden basis." Elsewhere, and certainly in the South, 
there is still a controlling class who rise above the influence of mere 
wealth. 

If for nothing else this publication is valuable as showing the 
homely virtues of those who have thrown more lustre upon our coun- 
try than can be effaced by the highest priced biographies in Fads and 
Fancies.

AN OLD-FASHIONED CHRISTMAS DINNER. 

Christmas, with its festivities and its preparations, was a busy 
time to the housekeeper of fifty years ago, " befo' de war," in Vir- 
ginia. It meant thought and labor for weeks beforehand; especially 
was this true of the homes in the country, where lavish entertainment 
was the rule. The home I have in mind is a rambling, old-fashioned 
Virginia house, thirty miles from Fredericksburg, and in that part of 
Virginia known as the Northern neck, which is said to have produced 
more great men than any other place of the same size in this country. 
Weeks before Christmas supplies were ordered from either Baltimore 
or Richmond. Then came the busy time. The Southern woman in 
those days, while the " Lady Bountiful " of her domain, and sur- 
rounded by servants ready to do her bidding, had her responsibilities 
and cares. She was up with the lark, saw her household in order; 
she ministered to the sick and comforted the afflicted ; bond and free 
alike had her care. There was as much excitement and anticipation 
among the negroes at Christmas as among the whites, from the small- 
est little darkey to Uncle Peter, the oldest negro on the plantation. 
Two weeks before Christmas began the busy time, seeding raisins, 
cutting citron, washing and drying currants, for these were the days 
before all this could be bought. Every housekeeper had her own 
especial receipts handed down from mother to daughter. In the big 
kitchen at night, before a blazing log fire, would sit the cook, sur- 
rounded by several of the house servants preparing the fruit for cakes, 
mincemeat and plum pudding. Apple toddy was made by an old 
family receipt usually a month beforehand, as it improved, like many 
other things, with age. The menu for a Christmas dinner at this old 
house was a soup, either calf's head or turtle ; then a turkey at one end 
and a young pig or a haunch of venison at the other, with a great 

21 



22 FAMOUS OLD RECEIPTS 

variety of vegetables. Wines of different kinds were served through- 
out the dinner, and of a rare vintage were they, for every man of 
means had his wine cellar and the V^irginia gentleman of those days 
was a connoisseur. Then came the dessert, to childhood's eyes most 
important; a bowl of calvesfoot jelly, sparkling in the cut glass bowl, 
and the oft repeated comparison of Santa Claus in the old nursery 
jingle, " that he had a round face and a little round belly, which shook 
when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly," was a good one to juvenile 
minds. The plum pudding was always brought in, in a blaze of glory, 
with a sprig of holly in the top, while the blue flame danced around it. 
A big fruit cake, mince pies and blanc-mange moulded in the shape of 
eggs and lying in a nest of thinly shaved lemon peel, were some of the 
Christmas cheer on that dinner table. The china was the old blue 
Canton, while the finest damask, cut glass and old silver added its 
aristocratic touch to the picture. Every servant had his share of 
the good things, and that night the sound of the fiddle and the shuffle 
of many feet gave evidence of a dance in the kitchen for the negroes. 
Years have passed. The master and mistress of this happy home 
have been sleeping many years in the old graveyard on the plantation. 
The descendants are scattered far and wide. The old blue china 
hansfs on the walls of the home of one of them in Germantown, with 
some of the silver that graced that last Christmas dinner. Two old 
receipt books, yellow^ with age and worn with much handling, are still 
preserved, and here are some of the receipts from such famous Vir- 
ginia housekeepers as Mrs. Roy Mason, Mrs. O. Taylor, Mrs. Ran- 
dolph and many others.

HOW TO COOK A HUSBAND. 

GODERICH, LAKE HURON, CANADA. 

In a lecture room, before a cooking school, 
For cooking a husband was given this rule : 
First, in selecting, to market don't go; 
The best you'll not find there, most surely no. 
For although there are many, yes, galore, 
The prime will always be brought to your door. 
Don't think for a moment, to bake or broil, 
Much better tie in the kettle to boil. 
Use a silken cord called comfort — 'twon't break, 
But one called duty is apt to be weak. 
To make him secure it is well, no doubt. 
Yes ! for aught we know, he'd be falling out. 
And then, too surely if your back were turned, 
He'd become, alas! both crusty and burned. 
In cooking a husband you'll plainly see, 
Like lobsters and crabs, alive they must be. 
Should he sputter and fuss, help there is none; 
Some husbands do it until they are done. 
Some sugar add, in the form of kisses ; 
You'll find to absorb, he rarely misses. 
Vinegar and pepper, use none at all; 
But of spice you may add a sprinkling small. 
Stir some, lest to the kettle he adhere. 
Thus making him useless, I greatly fear. 
Please not in his side some instrument stick, 
For when he is done you will know it quick. 
With proper treatment and excellent care 
You'll find him, indeed, delicious and rare.

THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE KITCHEN. 

Next in importance to the mammy in the Southern home was 
the cook, not only in her own estimation, but to those with whom she 
came in contact. She was queen in her domain — the kitchen. A 
representative of a prominent South Carohna family tells the follow- 
ing story: When a little girl of ten, she heard her mother say one 
(lay that she was descended from the Indian Princess, Pocahontas. 
This made a great impression on her childish mind. Going one day 
into the kitchen, she was summarily ordered out by the cook. Rising 
to the dignity of her ten years, and the blood of this princess, which 
she felt coursing through her veins, she said : " Don't you dare order 
me out. I am descended from a Princess." With great dignity the 
old cook, assuming a most queenly air, said: " I am descended from 
a princess, too." With rare, quick wit this young lady said : " Who 
is vour princess? " " Pocahontas," was the reply. " And," said this 
charming woman, " I never told the name of my princess, and retired 
from the royal dominion."

" Good bread, and good drink, a good fire in the hall, 
Brawer, pudding and sauce, and good mustard with all, 
Beef, mutton and pork, shred pies of the best, '^ 

Pig, veal, goose and capon, and turkey well drest. 
Cheese, apples and nuts, jolly carols to hear, 
Ah these, in the country, are counted good cheer ! " 

GOOD BREAD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. 

If bread is the " staff of life," the Southern housekeeper has many 
and a great variety. They are troublesome in a way, as they require 
while rising to be moved from one warm place to another in winter, 
or cold place in summer. The old negro cooks would often declare: 
" They sutinly did have to nuss dat bread last night,' meaning that 
the temperature varied and they got up to put the bread in a cooler 
or warmer place. Some years ago a party of young men went on a 
hunting trip, taking with them an old negro cook John. They were 
Southern men, who considered hot bread for breakfast a necessity. 
Morning after morning they would sit down to breakfast to heavy 
bread, so they told John he must do better. John was much im- 
pressed, so the next morning, although the night had been unusually 
cold, the rolls were light. " Why, John," they exclaimed. " these 
rolls are fine." " Yes, Sar," said John. " I made up my mind 1 
want gwine to have no more trouble, so I done tuk dat brade to l)ade 
wid me and done kiver it up jest like I done myself."

(A method of planking shad used by the Piscataway tribe in Mary-

Contributed by Mrs. W. Hincklc Smith, Bryn Mazvr, Pa. 

A pile of cord wood is made about 3 ft. high, 4 ft. wide, and 8 
to 20 ft. long, according to the number of shad to be planked. When 
this has been reduced to a bed of coals, the shad, which have been 
previously cleaned and split down the back, are fastened with nails 
to oak planks about 2 ft. wide, 4 ft. long, and 3 in. thick. These 
planks like wine of ancient vintage, are all the better for long keeping. 
After the impalement the planks are set up edgewise before the fire, 
and while cooking the shad are continually basted with a mixture of 
butter, baking grease and Worcestershire sauce, with the addition of 
salt and pepper. Meantime, the roes are being prepared on another 
and smaller fire. When all is ready they are served with clam chow- 
der and fresh spring vegetables. Many years ago old Jack Anderson, 
a relic of the days of slavery, used to say : '" Well, I tell you, when 
dey's done, marse, you jes' cook an' baste, an' baste an' cook twel dey 
smells so good you cain't wait no longah, den dey's done."

ICES, PUNCHES, ETC. 

THE ART OF SERVING WINE. 

Contributed by Mr. Paul Garrett, Norfolk, Va. 

From time immemorial, wine has stood for the pledge of 
friendship and good fellowship. 

To-day, more than ever, the serving of light wines has an estab- 
lished place in social usage. 

A glass of wine and a wafer makes the ideal repast for the 
afternoon gathering of ladies. The informal call, the evening party, 
the birthday table, the picnic or the lawn party, the wedding and the 
christening, not to mention the formal dinner — on every occasion 
sacred to the home where friend greets friend in social intercourse, 
pure light wines have their recognized place. 

In this country this is true to-day more so than ever before, 
because the American people are just waking up to the fact that Iiere 
at home are raised the best grapes in the world — grapes that by 
improved processes are being converted into wines of unquestioned 
purity and wholesomeness. 

" \'irginia Dare," "Pocahontas" and " ^Minnehaha " are the 
lightest of wines — clear, pure and with a clean, fresh, natural flavor 
delightful to the taste. Besides adding zest to the meal, they form 
an important supply of food for the nerves — food just as impor- 
tant as that which goes to the building up of bone and muscle. 

" How to Serve Wine " is a question of greater or less com- 
plexity, as the occasion is formal or informal. On an informal occa- 
sion, perhaps, only one wine will be served, the taste of the guests, 
of course, deciding the variety. If they be accustomed to the dry 
imported wines of Northern Europe, such as Rhine Wine, ]\Ioselle, 
or Sauterne. a bottle of Minnehaha should be served. 

If, on the other hand, the guests have no acquired tastes, noth- 

175 



176 FAMOUS OLD RECEIPTS 

ing can excel Virginia Dare or Pocaliontas. Being so delicate and 
fruity in flavor, these wines invariably find enthusiastic devotees in 
the ladies. 

In serving wines for a large formal dinner, there is much 
variation of ideas. It is a matter of taste rather than of rule. 
There is, however, a logical sequence that is usually followed : 

White wines with oysters (Minnehaha, Sauterne or Moselle). 

Yellow wines with soup (Virginia Dare, Sherry or Tokay). 

Red wines with roasts and game (Pocahontas, Port, F. F. V. 
Claret, Burgundy or Hiawatha — a red sparkling wine). 

Sweet wines with dessert (Pocahontas, Virginia Dare, Port, 
Madeira or Southern Sunshine). 

After dinner, before coffee, old Ports, Aladeiras, Sherries or 
Champagne. 

Champagne any time after soup, although strictly speaking it 
is an after-dinner wine. 

, Champagne is the ideal table wine. 

When Sherries are used, an old dry quality wnth nutty flavor 
is served with oysters, while a richer one should be used before 
coffee. 

If both Claret and Burgundy are desired, serve the Claret with 
the entree. Burgundy with the roast. 

WINE CAUTIONS. 
Contributed by Mr. Paul Garrett, Norfolk. Va. 

Dry wines should be kept in a cool, dry cellar, the bottles laid 
on their sides, so that the moisture will render the cork thoroughly 
air-tight. This is not necessary, however, when the bottles are 
sealed with other devices, as. for instance, the Garrett Cap and 
Crown. 

All old still wines — Claret, Sauterne. Sherry, Port, Madeira 
— should be decanted when they have been in bottles a sufficient 
time to precipitate. 



ICES, PUNCHES, ETC. 177 

In England, gentlemen decant their own wines; it is very 
simple, but must be done carefully. 

Stand the bottles upright 24 hours before decanting, first 
loosening the cork. When ready, draw the cork, hold the bottle 
to the light and pour slowly into the decanter, until the sediment 
begins to move. The decanted wine will then be perfectly clear and 
bright. 

Burgundies by custom are often served from the original bot- 
tles, but it is better to decant all still wines just before using. 

It must be remembered, however, that only the fortified wines, 
or those to which alcohol has been added, will keep for any time 
after being exposed to the air. The fortified wines are Sherry. 
Tokay, Port and Madeira. Many other foreign wines are fortified 
to a sufficient extent to stand exportation, rendering them strongly 
alcoholic. For this reason it is better for Americans to drink the 
wines of their own country. There being no need to export, there is 
no temptation to fortify and render them intoxicating. Scupper- 
nong products are the lightest and most delicate in the world, con- 
taining a minimum of alcohol and are rich in the health-giving 
properties of the grape. 

Clarets and Burgundies should be served at a temperature of 
about 65 to 70 degrees, generally obtained by keeping the bottles 
in the dining-room several hours before serving. 

White wines (Virginia Dare, Minnehaha, Rhine, Sauterne. 
Moselle, Reisling) should be cooled, but not thoroughly chilled, to 
about 40 to 50 degrees. 

Sherry and Port should not be too cold, for if they are chilled 
they will cloud. 

Madeiras are best at about 65 degrees. " Extra Dry " Cham- 
pagne cannot be too cold — the nearer to frappe the better. 

" Brut " Champagne should be chilled, but too low a tempera- 
ture makes it acid and rough. Freezing kills it entirely. 

Remember, that if a variety of wines is to be used, a very little 
of each is required. 



178 FAMOUS OLD RECEIPTS 

ETIQUETTE OF THE WINE GLASS. 

Contributed by Mr. Paul Garrett, Norfolk, Va. 

Each place at table should be supplied with all the glasses to 
be used during the dinner. 

There are, in general, four varieties : 

The Claret Glass is used for all still wines. With white wines 
a delicately tinted ruby glass is sometimes used with pretty effect. 
For red wines the glass must always be colorless. 

The Sherry Glass is used exclusively for Sherry. There are 
numberless designs, both in plain glass and cut glass, but the gen- 
eral shape is always the same. Round base, slender stem, plain 
or ornamental — bowl , lily shaped — the whole effect being very 
graceful and delicate. 

The W^ine Glass is very much like the Claret Glass in shape, 
but smaller. It is used for Port, Madeira, and heavy fortified 
wines. This is the glass which should be used in the serving of 
wine at an afternoon gathering or as an informal evening refresh- 
ment. 

Champagne Glasses are of three kinds, the selection being 
largely a matter of taste. 

•The " Saucer " Champagne is perhaps the most popular glass 
just now. It has a thin stem and a wide shallow bowl. 

The " Fountain " Champagne will always be preferred by most. 
It has a hollow stem and deep bowl. The wine, effervescing from 
the stem, creates a miniature fountain in the center of the glass, 
with very pretty effect. 

The Champagne Tumbler is a glass preferred principally by 
gentlemen, who are sometimes inclined to scorn the esthetic and 
who care less for beautiful effects.

JOHN DABXEY'S MINT JULEP. 

Richmond, Va. 

This famous receipt has a history well worth recording of 
"the man and his julep." John Dabney was the famous old negro 
caterer of Richmond until a few years ago. John was a very 
remarkable character, and in personality most striking, combining 
as he did some of the Indian with his negro antecedents. He was 
a slave of a prominent Virginia family, who had consented to set' 
John free some years before the war. John had almost finished 
paying for his freedom by his thrift and determination when war 
came. After Mr. Lincoln's proclamation his master said, " John, 
you are free." and wished him good luck, and John started life for 
himself as a caterer in Richmond. He soon had a small bank ac- 
count. Meantime war had left his master's family in reduced cir- 
cumstances — his master dead. Taking the amount that was still 
due his old master, had war not settled the account in a different 
way. John Dabney went to his mistress and begged she would 
accept what he believed to be rightfully hers. Thomas Nelson Page 
hearing of the incident embodied it in one of his most character- 
istic bits of the old South. General IMaury meeting John Dabney 
on the streets of Richmond a few days afterwards extended his 
hand and said, " John, I have just been reading what Mr. Page 
savs about you, and John you are a gentleman." Taking off his 
hat ^^■ith that well-bred courtesy that the negro of the past had. and 
the negro of the present has not, he said, " Thanky. General, that's 
what I tries to be, sar." The young men of the different clubs in 
Richmond had presented John with two very handsome silver loving' 
cups appropriately inscribed. John was very proud of these, and 
when he wanted to confer an especial honor one of these cups was 
sent filled to the brim with one of his juleps. One morning at the 
Old White there was a knock at my door just before breakfast. In 
answer, there stood one of John's assistants with one of John's 



i8o FAMOUS OLD RECEIPTS 

cups filled to the brim with John's julep, which he presented with 
John Dabney's compliments. On the top rested a pink rose. 

Here is what composed this beverage: Crushed ice, as much 
as you can pack in and sugar, mint bruised, and put in with the 
ice, then your good whiskey, and the top surmounted by more mint, 
a strawberry, a cherry, a slice of pineapple, or, as John expressed it, 
" Any other little fixings you like." On mine was the pink rose. 
I pinned on the rose, drank some of that never-to-be-forgotten 
I'uelp. Had I drunk half, I would have never danced my morning 
german. Then I went with my father to seek John and express 
my appreciation of the honor. I found him at the door of his 
sanctum. With a most profound bow he received my thanks. 
" Yes, mam," he said, " I always was mighty fond of your Pa, the 
General." Here's to you, John Dabney ! Would there were others 
of your race to follow in your footsteps. — Sue Mason Maury Hal- 
sey' — (Mrs. James T. Halsey).

make you unable to reach the lamp post, the third, alas ! will make 
you fight yourself. 

One and a half gals. (6 qts.) Jamaica rum, 8 qts. Apollinaris. 
2 lbs. sugar, i jar or can Maraschino cherries, ijA doz. lemons, i can 
sliced pineapple, i small tumbler raspberry cordial. Reserve 3 qts.

LADY WASHINGTON WEDDING CAKE. 

This recipe was taken from an old family recipe book (tat- 
tered, but still legible in spite of century old ink). The old-fash- 
ioned recipe was intended for baking before an open fire, and con- 
tained directions for baking before an open fire, for putting embers 
under the oven, and letting the batter rise 3 hours, then baking 
for 3 hours and drawling the oven away from the fire, letting 
the cake soak at least 2 hours. If it was very large, it was to be 
left in the chimney corner all night.

window^ of his modest state home, " as it could not be called more "

good living that they willingly accepted the offices of our Aunt 
Phebe.

PICKLE. 

Virginia housekeepers have always been noted for their pickles, 
and their receipts are good, old, and tried ones. After all, a decade 
brings around its customs, modified. In an old history which I have 
recently read an account is given of the old days and entertaining at 
Mount Vernon, and mentions that just before dinner was announced 
the old butler would pass pickle with the mint juleps. So now before 
dinner we have an olive in our cocktail.

Private recipe 75 years old. 
Contributed by Mrs. Louis R. Lemoiue, Philadelphia, Pa. 

Ten heads of cabbage (hard packed). It is better to get them 
in fall or winter. Slice cabbage J^ in. thick, crosswise, pack it in a 
new tub or very large vessel, cover with salt and cold water (which 
you will make strong enough to hold an egg), then add about a 
quarter more water. Slice, crosswise. 6 large white onions, sprink- 
ling salt between each layer. Next morning wash the onions and 
cover with fresh cold water. Drain the cabbage from the brine and 
chop it. Put a layer of cabbage in a large wooden bowl, sprinkle 
some of the chopped onions, some turmeric, and a handful of celery- 
seed, and so on, layer after layer. Then mix with, hands thoroughly. 
While this is being done have in your preserving kettle about 13^ 
gallons of white vinegar with ten cents worth of nice fresh cinna- 
mon, some whole grains of black pepper, a little mace, a few cloves 
and a few pods of dried red peppers, or a level teaspoon of cayenne 
])epper. Boil until the vinegar is quite strong of the spices, add to 
the vinegar about 2 lbs. of sugar. Strain the vinegar through a thin 
muslin bag over the cabbage. Wash out the kettle and transfer the 
mixture to the kettle and scald until hot all through, but do not let 
it boil or cook. Stir frequently with a w^ooden spoon. At the time 
you put the cabbage in bowl to be chopped, take about j^ of a 40-cent 
box of good mustard and mix it, smooth, and quite thick, with warm 
water. While the cabbage is cooling, beat into the mustard a bot- 
tle of the very best olive oil, as you would for a nice, smooth, dress- 
ing, adding vinegar until smooth and thick. When the cabbage is 
cool mix the dressing well in, put into '5^ gallon jars and cover 
closely. In two or three days it will be ready for use. 

Ingredients Needed. — Ten heads of cabbage. 6 large white

DELICIOUSLY STICKY SPONGE CAKE. 
Emeline Iungerich Fowle. 

Contributed by Afrs. George D. Fowle, Phila., Pa. 

Take 6 eggs, and their whole weight, in powdered sugar. Break 
them, and keep yolks and whites apart. Take ^ their weight of 
sifted flour, the juice and grated rind of i lemon, unless a stronger 
flavor is desired, then use -2 lemons. Beat the yolks and sugar to- 
gether, until very light. Beat the whites until they are so light and 
dry, that you can turn the dish upside down. 

Add the lemon juice to the yolks and sugar, then half the flour, 
and % of the whites of the eggs. Put them with the yolks and 
sagar, in a bowl, and mix all together with a wooden spoon. Then 
add more flour, but do not use all the flour, if the batter is thick, for 
if too thick, it will make the sponge' solid. 

The batter must drop evenly from the spoon. Then stir in 
lightly, on the top, the rest of the whites of the eggs, to make a light 
crust. Bake in a moderate oven twenty or twenty-five minutes. 
Grease the pans thickly with butter, as it makes the crust crisp. If 
the oven is too hot, the cake will puff up, and become dry and brown, 
and the crust will not form. The success depends upon the mixing 
and baking.
