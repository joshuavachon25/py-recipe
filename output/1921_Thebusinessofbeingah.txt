Nl II' 



As meat is one of the most important items of American diet, its price is 
a matter of moment to every housewife. Comparisons between the cost of Hve 
animals and the price per pound of meat sometimes lead to the conclusion that 
the existing margin is too wide and that possibly the profits of the middleman are 
too large. 

After fair analysis, the housewife realizes that a live animal is not all meat 
and, furthermore, that the meat carcass is not all steaks and rib roasts. A com- 
parison, therefore, between the live cost of meat animals per pound and the cost 
per pound of a tenderloin is misleading, if it results in any conclusions relative 
to margins. 

Then we must reckon with the wide difference in grades of meat. We can- 
not correctly estimate the cost of a steak cut from a prime beef by that of a steak 
from a grass-fed cow. There are several grades of meat, depending upon the 
nature and feeding, each wholesome and nutritious, but some demanding more 
special cooking than others. 

About fifty-five per cent of a steer is meat; the remainder includes the hide 
and various other by-products, which, except the hide, are not worth in their 
primary state anywhere near as much per pound as they cost alive. The fifty-five 
per cent of the animal which is meat must,. therefore, carry the greater portion 
of the original cost. That is why a steer carcass might be sold by the packer for 
twenty cents a pound and still fail to pay a profit, even though the live animal 
cost the packer only twelve cents a pound. The casual observer, noting a differ- 
ence of eight cents a pound between the live animal and the carcass, might say a 
sixty-six per cent increase in price is unduly large; but a little deeper study de- 
velops that the return from the carcass in this instance would fail to equal the 
amount paid for the live steer. 

When a retailer buys a carcass, he purchases neck meat as well as loins; chucks 
as well as rounds. Portions of the carcass have to be sold at or sometimes less 
than he paid per pound for the carcass. The choice cuts necessarily have to 
make up for the losses on the less desirable portions. It is not unreasonable, there- 
fore, that the retailer should charge fifty or sixty cents a pound for choice steaks 
and fifteen cents a pound for boiling beef out of a carcass which he bought at the 
rate of twenty cents a pound. 

Only the aggregate price which the retailer gets for all parts and portions of 
the carcass will show his margin over the initial cost. It is wholly improper, 
therefore, to compare sixty-cent steaks with twelve-cent cattle with a view to 
determining profit. 

The same thing is true of hogs and of sheep. A hog is not all meat, nor is the meat 
all ham. A sheep is not all carcass and only a small part of the carcass cuts up into 
chops. One must know the aggregate return and something about the costs of doing 
business before a justifiable conclusion as to price margins can be determined.

THE BUSINESS OF BEING A HOUSEWIFE 




THE home managers have in their hands the most im- 
portant business of the nation. American women 
reaUze that to their duties as home makers, mothers, 
and guiding influences, is added an important economic 
responsibihty. The manner in which the purchasing power 
of twenty million home managers is used has an inestim- 
able effect upon the production, collection, and distribution 
of all products in the market. 

This second edition of "The Business of Being a 
Housewife" is respectfully dedicated to the thousands of 
wise home managers who are determined to understand 
more fully their relation to the producers of the country 
and to the great industries, such as that of Armour and 
Company, who have made possible the providing of per- 
fect food in perfect condition at any distance from the 
farm. 



ECONOMIC A study of the national and world situation 
CHANGES on food production shows that old-time low 
food prices may never return. Formerly 
much of the food was raised by numerous individual 
families on Government land at nominal cost; today prac- 
tically all food is raised on expensive land — the plains 
have been turned into villages and farms by the increasing 
population. Many men and expensive machinery and 
equipment are needed to produce our present high standard 
products. 

It became economically unsound for so great a per- 
centage of food producers to spend their time in producing 
meats and staples, only part of which could be consumed 
by themselves and their near neighbors, the rest going to 
waste. The great waste of the surplus products set the 
minds of men of genius to devising ways to preserve the 
foods of abundant harvests for the seasons of scarcity. 
The result is before us in the form of modern cold-storage 
plants, refrigerator cars, volume-curing and pickling of 
meat products, and volume-canning of fish, meats, fruits, 
and vegetables; great cereal factories, etc. 

The standard of quality has been raised and the sani- 
tary handling of foods greatly developed. While this has 
increased the prices a little, it has also increased the efii- 
ciency and earning power of the consumer and has tended 
towards the better health of the nation. The only way 
to equalize prices, for the high quality of foods demanded 
by discriminating home managers, is through efficient 



commercial handling and the conservation of every bit 
of material. While the efficiency of the Armour organiza- 
tion is regarded as of the highest standard, the organiza- 
tion is continually striving to still further increase this 
efficiency. 

Armour and Company act as a great service link 
between the farmers and consumers. Through our agri- 
cultural department we reach out to the farmer and advise 
him in producing the best meat animals and farm products 
within his farm's possibilities. We assist him to improve 
his soil and to feed his animals to the best advantage. 

The raw material buyers for Armour and Company 
are all experts in their special lines. They search the 
markets to select the best products for each branch of our 
service. Then various corps of specialists analyze and 
prepare the foods in the most efficient, scientific, and satis- 
factory way for the consumer. Through able management 
the most expert service today goes into the translating of 
a meat animal into wholesome U.S. Government inspected 
meat, either fresh, smoked, dried, prepared, or canned. 

BUY FOR Expensive experimenting with foods may 
REAL be eliminated from your accounts by the 

VALUE simple method of buying by known brands. 

Label reading is today's most important 
buying guide. A dealer soon learns the wants of his quality 
buyers, and, knowing your demand for high standard 
commercially prepared foods, he will be careful to select 
correspondingly good quality foods when replenishing his 
stock. 

Every careful home maker demands that the meat she 
buys, whether fresh, smoked, dried, cured, or canned, bears a 
U. S. Government inspected-and-passed label, and should 
demand canned foods marketed under a reliable firm nariie. 

Standards of purity and quality in the preparation of 
commercial foods have gradually raised, until now there is 
practically every food for every need in convenient sani- 
tary packages at your corner market under a quality label 
guarantee. 

Drudgery has been literally taken out of food prepara- 
tion. Madam Home Manager's time may now well be em- 
ployed along more constructive lines than in shelling peas 
and stringing beans. Her's is the responsibility and privi- 
lege of selecting foods for her family's menus in such 
combinations that every food-need of the body is supplied 
in proper proportion. 



Be sure of real value for every expenditure 



DO YOU KNOW This is one of the most serious mat- 
FOOD VALUES? ters before us today, and the physi- 
cians of the entire country are deplor- 
ing the fact that many of the children of the wealthy as 
well as of the poor are undernourished. Do you know foods? 
Prepared foods release you from less important tasks, that 
you may have time to learn food values. It rests with 
the responsible housewife to plan her own time so as to 
achieve the greatest returns in the health and efficiency 
of her family. Food knowledge means a better-fed nation. 
A pantry stocked with a wide variety of quality foods 
and a working knowledge of individual needs and food 
values will make it possible for the home manager to pre- 
pare the proper foods within her budget limitations. 

PLAN YOUR A simple budget, or account keeping 

EXPENDITURES system, is a necessity in every well- 
ordered, successful business. The 



world of today holds so many attractions that we must 
carefully select those necessities and comforts that will 
mean the most in real value to us, and then adhere to 
that selection. The only way to know that we are following 
our own plan is to have a simple accounting system. At 
the end of the month, we should look over the figures 
and decide upon the readjustments necessary. To insure 
progress and stability, our monthly accounts should show 
some savings and advancement expenditures. 

We offer suggestions throughout this book, arranged 
to help the average housewife solve her knotty home- 
managing problems. We have been greatly assisted by 
the women editors of national women's publications, 
prominent home economics teachers, and writers on vital 
home subjects. This array of talent aims to make this 
book of the greatest help possible to the American House- 
wife. 

— Jean Prescott Adams 



ARMOUR PRODUCTS 



Many thousands of housewives have come to depend 
upon the Armour Oval Label as a buying guide for a wide 
variety of their pantry and refrigerator staples; they know 
they can depend upon the uniformity and quality of every 
Oval Label product 

Madam Home Manager receives the full benefit of our 
fifty-some years of experience in caring for foods. She 
has the Armour assurance of uniformity and quality and 
is guided in her buying by the distinguishing quality Oval 
Ubel. 

We prepare and distribute with great efficiency, fresh, 
smoked, cured, dried, prepared, and canned meats, all 
Government inspected. 

A full line of Armour shortenings and frying mediums, 
as well as our economical oleomargarines and delicious 
Cloverbloom Butter, may be secured from your dealer. 
Salad oil under the Oval Label, as well as peanut butter, 
will continue to meet with popular favor. The evaporated 



milk and identifiable or carton eggs are considered indis- 
pensable by the average home manager. 

Cheese is becoming more and more favored for its 
high food value, and it is with satisfaction that many learn 
of the great variety of cheese sold under the Armour 
guarantee of quality. 

Armour's Pork and Beans. Peanut Butter, Evaporated 
Milk, Mince Meat, etc., are favorite products, and Madam 
Home Manager will be able to obtain the well-established 
Armour brands at her market. 

Armour and Company maintain a well organized de- 
partment of Food Economics as a medium of expression 
to the American housewife. This department is made up 
of trained and experienced dietitians, teachers of home 
economics, food chemists, practical home managers, writers 
and lecturers. 

We are equipped and prepared to give every home 
maker the practical, technical and economic information 
she may need on any food or home managing subject. 



THE PURPOSE 

It is the purpose of this book to assist Madam Home 
Manager in her masterj- of the problems incident to the 
feeding of a family for health, happiness and efficiency. 

To simplify the presentation of this very important 
material, we have divided the book into four sections: 
Section one covers the apportionment of the income; Sec- 
tion two deals with the wise selection of foods and the 
place of each class of food in the building of a well-bal-

anced menu. Section three is devoted to fundamental 
cooker>' suggestions. Section four holds for the reader a 
wealth of general information to assist in simplifying the 
labor of cookery. 

As this is a manual of household efficiency and econo- 
my, we have aimed to give the greatest possible number 
of helpful suggestions, referring the reader to a number 
of splendid cook books for recipes. (See Page 28)

MAKING YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE 




Every home maker has a cherished ideal for the vari- 
ous members of her family. The rapidity with which that 
dream is realized depends upon how the family income 
and individual energy are used. To those who have never 
kept a record of expenditures, the first definite step toward 
establishing a substantial financial basis and assuring prog- 
ress to the family is the keeping of an expense account. 
Each day, make an accurate accounting of all expenditures. 
Keep this carefully for four months, then, with that account 
as a basis, plan your expenditures for the next four months 
and live within that plan. The third quarter, keep your 
expense account again and then you will have the accurate 
information regarding the financial needs of your partic- 
ular family. After a careful analysis, make up a year's 
budget, cutting down non-essentials and adding to ac- 
counts that really mean an advance step toward your goal. 

The following percentages will serve as a guide show- 
ing the possibilities of various incomes. Each family will 
find it necessary to adjust the figures according to special 



needs, local conditions and family ambitions. Special edu- 
cation is worth economy in many lines, as it offers future 
returns and is really an investment. 

The food section of the Family Account Book is per- 
haps the most important Without properly prepared food 
in proper combination, and quantity, we are not able to ex- 
ercise our greatest earning ability, to grasp new situations 
as we should, or to invest our savings wisely. By keeping 
the food account according to the body building uses of 
the food purchased, we daily progress in our food know- 
ledge and become adepts at using alternative foods. 

When one really operates a budget plan to win, it is an 
advancement in itself. In cases of a large independent in- 
come it is wise to have your banker's representative work 
out a budget for you. The budget outline, on page 6, is 
estimated for a family of five, one young child, two school 
children, mother and father. Where the family is smaller, 
the food and clothing accounts will change, the amount saved 
going either to savings, investments, or advancements.

The accompanying is a family budget outline that is easily adjust- 
able to entirely satisfactory use in your home. If the home manager, 
by means of her ingenuity or by domg work herself, saves on the 
regular scheduled expenditures, that money should go to her per- 
sonal account. Preparedness is a big factor in the growth of the 
Home Manager's credit column. 

With this form as a guide, lay out your family budget outline, 
in any ordinary notebook eight by eleven inches. Substitute your 
own income and percentage figures, listing your needs under their 
proper heads. As this outline is general, it may contain some sug-

SELECTING FOODS FOR QUAUTY AND VARIETY 




PROTEIN FOODS 

Food experts agree that 20 per cent, of the entire diet 
should consist of protein. In our country, meat is the 
favorite protein food. It provides a portion of the energy 
which is also furnished by carbohydrates and fats, but its 
chief purpose is to supply material for growth and repair 
of the body tissues which are constantly worn out in the 
performance of their various functions. 




FRESH BEEF 

Much of the frontier, upon which vast numbers of 
cattle were formerly raised, is now cut up into small 
farms and town lots. Hereafter, we must raise the greater 
portion of our meat animals upon expensive land and feed. 
The cost of production has increased many fold and con- 
sequently meat is 
higher in price. 
Packers, through 
utilizing by-prod- 
ucts, keep the 
cost of wholesome 
meat within the 
reach of the con- 
sumer.

U.S. GOVERNMENT MEAT INSPECTION 




Every home manager should have a thorough under- 
standing of what U. S. Government Inspection of meat is — 
its significance and importance in her selection of meats. 
Practically everyone who has ever purchased meat has 
noticed a round purple stamp, the size of a half dollar, 
bearing the words "U. S. Inspected and Passed," in the 
center of the commercial cuts displayed. 

The government stamp on the meat you purchase is 
your absolute guarantee that the meat you are buying is 
wholesome. It signifies that the animal from which that piece 
of meat was cut had passed four separate inspections, and 
that the meat was found to be free from all disease and in 
perfect condition when it left the packing house. 

Government meat inspection is one of the greatest 
protections to the American table. Only concerns doing

All meats have four inspections. The ante-mortem 
inspection is termed "on the hoof." The three post-mor- 
tem inspections are made upon the glands of the neck, on 
the viscera and on the dressed carcass. 

Only about 60 per cent of the meat consumed in the 
United States is United States Government inspected. 
When the public shall demand that all meats be inspected, 
we will have the much-needed nation-wide inspection, which 
will insure wholesome meats for all. Women's organiza- 
tions should make this movement a definite part of their 
regular programs and consider it a duty to buy only U. S. 
Government inspected meats. 

The products of each packing house are identified by 
the letter and number and the U. S. Gov't Inspection mark 
on each commercial cut. 

COLD STORAGE HELPS SOLVE THE 

NATION S FOOD PROBLEMS 

Cold storage is a great factor in the present solution 
of the nation's food problems. It is a means of holding 
certain foods over from the season of plenty to the season 
of scarcity. Since the first mechanical refrigeration was 
installed in the late eighties. Government investigators have 
been continually studying various methods of preserving 
food, without canning, and all insist that there is no modern 
method which equals cold storage. Understanding is fast 
eliminating the prejudice against use of supplies from cold 
storage plants of reputable houses. 



Cold storage makes possible a full variety of foods at all seasons 



The first cold-storage house was cooled by the use of 
a mixture of crushed ice and salt. The modern process 
is the ammonia brine method. As the liquid ammonia 
enters the pipes that carry the refrigeration through the 
cooler, it expands and is forced through the pipes as an 
ammonia gas. An absorption method is also frequently 
in use. Ammonia brine is by far the best method pf cool- 
ing. It is cleanly, absolutely odorless and, through use, 
has proved its efficiency. 

The establishment of scientific refrigeration plants has 
made possible a variety and abundance of food at any 
season on the American table. 

Coolers are kept at an average temperature of 38° F. 
for foods kept a short time. The temperature of the freezer 
is normally ten above zero to ten below. Fresh meats are 
not allowed to stay in the coolers longer than one to two 
weeks. If they must be held longer, they are sent to the 
freezer. When meat is to be thawed, it is taken from the 
freezer and sent to the coolers. Once taken from the 
freezer and defrosted, neither meat nor any other food 
should ever go back. There are time limiting cold-storage 
laws in twenty states. Twelve months is the limit of time 
allowed in nineteen states. 



BUTTER AND Butter in cold storage is kept at a tem- 
EGGS perature of zero to five below. Its 

sweetness and delicate flavor is the 
same when taken from storage as when put in. 

Eggs that are absolutely fresh and in perfect condi- 
tion when placed in cold storage, will keep perfectly at a 
temperature between 29° F. and 31° F. for six to nine 
months. Eggs laid in April and May are kept for mid- 
winter use, and the June pack is used in autumn and early 
winter when the supply is scarce and prices high. 



POULTRY The box of frozen poultry your dealer dis- 
plays fresh from cold storage is most attrac- 
tive and appetizing. A Nationally known name on the 
box guarantees the quality. Such poultry was especially 
selected and carefully fed some time before killing. It is 
fine-flavored and dainty. Always buy your frozen poultry 
in the frozen state and thaw it out at home. Directions for 
thawing are on page 13.

GREAT VARIETY OF MEAT CUTS 



The great importance of meat as food lies in its high 
protein content. Protein is body building material. It 
forms one-fifth of our food requirements. Half of the pro- 
tein requirement is furnished by meat. In lean meat the 
solid protein is very nearly in the pure form. 

Meat is delicately constructed with small cells of tis- 
sue holding the flavory juices. These cells are held together 
by a connective tissue. In the cheaper cuts of meat, the 
cells or fibers holding the juices are long and the connec- 
tive tissue thick. In the structure of the expensive steaks 
and loin cuts, the cells are short and the connective tissue' 
thin. It is this difference in structure that makes it neces- 
sary to use entirely different methods of cooking for the 
tender cuts and for the cheaper ones. The same result — 
a tender, flavory, nutritious cut of meat — may be obtained 
with the cheaper cut as with the expensive loin cuts, if the 
proper method of cooking is employed. 

EQUALIZING One so often hears the remark, "I wish 
YOUR MEAT someone would invent a new animal." 
BUYING The housewife is tired of ordering beef, 

mutton, pork or veal day after day. Too 
often she orders only the roasts, steaks or chops from these 
typical animals and then complains because her meat bill 
is high. This idea of lack of variety in fresh meats is all be- 
cause of the unsound and uninteresting habit of buying the 
same cuts over and over again. 

For every loin of beef there are several other cuts 
besides the extra portions, such as heart, liver, kidney, 
brain, etc. In these lie possibilities for many distinctive 
dishes and interesting flavors. 

While there are not so many cuts of pork and lamb, 
there are great possibilities for variety in the preparation. 

Nine out of ten home managers have believed for 
years, as do some even now, that the more expensive and 
most tender cuts of meat must naturally be most nutritious 
and that the cheaper, long fibered cuts are to be discarded 
or left for the butcher to dispose of, not realizing that their 
purchase of the tender cuts only, forces prices of these cuts 
high enough to cover the cost of the carcass. We are 
grateful that our leading dietitians of today are teaching 
women the truth: that the cheaper cuts of meat are ex- 
actly as nutritious as the tenderer cuts, if not more so, be- 
cause the blood is drawn to the parts in which the muscles 
are constantly used, thus continually rebuilding the tissue. 

In a dressed beef carcass of 700 pounds there are 
about 200 pounds of prime meat. The loin of the hind 




quarter, composed of sirloin, porterhouse, and club steaks, 
and the prime ribs of the fore quarter, are the commercial 
cuts most tender and easily prepared, and so are most in 
demand. Your butcher orders the cuts you demand. If 
you neglect the cheaper cuts and extra meat portions, 
he will not order them, and the expense of their production 
will be distributed over the cuts in demand. 

An economically sound buying campaign would be a res- 
olution by the housewives to use in its regular order every 
cut on a side of meat before reordering a cut. One of the 
extra meat portions could well be every third meat purchase. 

In order to secure the most satisfactory cuts of meat, 
marketing should be done in person. Before this can be 
done with any degree of satisfaction, the buyer should be 
familiar with the various cuts of beef, pork and mutton. 

The meal is planned around the meat dish, as a rule ; 
so it is most important to select the main meat dish with 
greatest care. 

HOW When buying beef, see that it is bright red 

TO SELECT in color, streaked with fat— and firm. The 
MEAT streaks of fat add to the food value and 

make a more flavory steak or roast. Veal 
is pink in color, but less firm. Mutton flesh is firm and 
dull red in color, the fat hard and white or slightly yellow. 
Pork is dark pink in color and the fat is less firm than 
beef or mutton. 

SUPPLYING YOUR The modem system of refrigeration 
DEALER WITH has made world-wide distribution of 

FRESH MEAT fresh meat possible. Refrigerator 

cars, iced en route in such a man- 
ner that the contents are kept always in a current of cold 
air, make it possible to carry the products of the packing 
house to remote parts of the country and deliver them in 
sound condition. 

The housewife in turn may have such products by be- 
ing discriminating in her marketing, skillful in her cooking 
and careful in her serving. 

By a knowledge of all the cuts of meat, the housewife 
can keep down her meat expenditures. She should also 
have her recipe file well stocked with tested recipes for the 
wide variety of popular meat dishes to be made with the 
less expensive cuts. 

For those who do not include meat in their diet, there 
is a wide variety of non-meat protein foods to choose from. 
Eggs, cheese, milk, and beans will give the necessary pro- 
tein for a complete diet.

BEEF THE FAVORITE MEAT 




Much of the vigor and force of Americans is attributed to the beef which is so generously included in the American diet. 
It is the favorite meat of a large percentage of people of every nation because it is easy to secure, is delicious of flavor 
and, properly cooked, is easily assimilated. The best cuts of beef for broiling are porterhouse, sirloin, and tenderloin 
steaks. For roasting, the prime ribs are preferred, while for the pot roast the rump, round, chuck, shoulder clod and 
brisket result in a tender piece of meat of delicious flavor when subject to slow, moist cooking.

POULTRY 




Poultry is one of the most popular meats found upon 
the American table. Dry-picked poultry is the most san- 
itary and desirable. It is no simple matter to provide 

fresh poultry to 



our thickly pop- 
ulated cities. 




But with improved breeding, scientific feeding and the 
modem cold-storage houses and refrigerator cars, Armour 
and Company supply a large clientele with either fresh or 
cold-storage poultry of the highest quality. "Spring chick- 
ens," so called because before the days of storage they could 
be obtained only in the spring — are from three to six 
months old. The older members of the chicken family are 
known as "fowl." 

HOW TO SELECT A chicken's feet are soft and smooth 

and the end of the breastbone is 

flexible. Poultry that is to be carried over from the season of 



plenty is carefully selected and specially fed and prepared. 
Only the choicest corn and milk fed poultry is worthy of 
the skill and science displayed in modem cold storage. 
Scientific methods of packing fresh poultry, and shipment 
in the refrigerator cars originated by the packers, assures 
the most select fresh poultry in season. The undrawn 
pouJtry is preferred to the drawn poultry in the market. 

To thaw frozen poultry, submerge it in a pan of cold 
water and leave in the water until thawed — about four 
hours for a four-pound hen. Cook as soon as thawed. 
To "draw," it is only necessary to make an incision 
below the breastbone just large enough to insert the hand 
and remove the entire viscera at once. 
_^_\ Separate the giblets, remove the gall 

JJ5|»<^^i bladder without breaking it, and clean 

?<St' S ? the gizzard by cutting through the flesh 

and removing the inside sack intact ; peel 
the fleshy part off the sack. Insert two 
fingers under the skin of the breast and 
draw out and discard crop and windpipe.. 
Wash the inside of the bird by allowing 
clean cold water to run through it. Wipe 
inside jmd out From this point, the 
chicken is treated according to the method to be used 
in cooking. If it is to be "fried," it is split in half length- 
wise, if very young, or in smaller pieces if it is a fowl. 
For a roast, the chicken is left whole ; for stewing, the fowl 
is entirely disjointed.

MAIN DISHES FOR MANY MEALS 




LAMB 

Lamb and mutton afford welcome meat dishes. Lamb 
is most easily digested and very nutritious. 

From a standpoint of economics, the increased use of 
lamb and mutton results in greater production of wool. 

In the menu, lamb and mutton should hold a perma- 
nent place because of the number of attractive and whole- 
some dishes they afford. The crown roast of lamb is a 
decorative and delicious oish. The leg of lamb and shoulder 
roll are just of the right size to be convenient for the aver- 
age family. With a sauce of tart jelly accompanying, they 
make an excellent special or company dinner dish. There 
are the loin chops; "French" and "American" rib chops, 
delicious morsels when broiled; the shoulder, which may be 
made into a mock duck that would deceive the most observ- 
ant; the neck and other cuts, which make delicious stews, 
ragouts and broth. Twice a week is not too often to have 
lamb in the menu.

PORK 

The story of pork in the menu takes us back to the 
days when the Chinese people discovered the goodness of 
roast pork when the house burned and accidentally result- 
ed in the first "burnt pig." Every house in the village was 
soon in ashes to supply every inhabitant with the delicacy, 
and its popularity has steadily increased. 

Like all meat, pork is classed among the protein foods 
and builds body tissue. Because of its high percentage of 
fat, it also supplies heat and energy to the body. 

The U. S. Government Inspection stamp guarantees 
the wholesomeness of the pork you buy. 

The digestibility of pork depends largely upon proper 



cooking — it should be thoroughly cooked in a slow oven. 
Smoked pork, in the form of ham and bacon, is very easily 
digested, this being due to the curing and smoking. 

In planning the menu including pork, include vege- 
tables containing considerable water, such as cabbage or 
greens, and tart fruit and spicy dessert. Such a combina- 
tion will complete a meal rich in food value and satisfying 
to the appetite.

FISH 

Fish is an easily assimilated protein food and is suffi- 
cient for the main dish of the meal occasionally. See 
cook books, referred to on page 28, for cookery methods. 

Fresh fish of many varieties are available only to those 
who live near the great bodies of water. The national pro- 
ducer, however, by canning makes it possible for all house- 
wives, regardless of residence, to have these valuable foods 
at any season. The process of canning is done with the 
utmost attention to every detail necessary to produce a 
f)erfect product. 

The best quality of various kinds of fish are selected, 
canned, and transported to all parts of the country. The 
housewife has but to exercise her ability in attractive ser- 
vice and correct combination when using these foods. The 
nationally recognized brands of shrimp, sardines, lobster, 
clams, and salmon are found in every quality retail store 
throughout our country.

HAM AND BACON 



Ham and bacon are two of the 
most popular foods in the Amercan 
I l.l-<I;^ market. These tasty staple foods 
serve a double purpose. While they are perhaps the most 
satisfactory stimulators of a dull appetite, they are such 
hearty foods that in proper combination they easily satisfy 
the most ravenous appetite. 

Hams smoked in the stockinet covering retain their 
shape and keep moist and juicy to the last slice. The 
covering should be left on the raw ham and folded or 
tied over the cut surface so the ham will retain all the 
delicate nut flavor given by our special cure and expert 
handling. 

The ideal ham is firm, moist, juicy, tender and of me- 
dium weight not too fat or too lean. The stockinet cov- 
ering keeps the selected ham moist and firm. 

Ham in some form is a welcome part of either break- 
fast, luncheon or dinner several days every week. 

Bacon should be fine and firm — it is selected to suit 
varying tastes and may be purchased with either the fat 
or lean predominating or evenly distributed. Through

changes take place in meats »• " 
which render them more

bacon is one of the 
most easily di-

and savory forms of fat. As sources of heat and energy, 
bacon and ham rank high. 

Even for. a small family, it is wise to buy a whole ham. 
This kind of quantity buying is economical and the many 
ways to serve ham add variety to your menus. In plan- 
ning the use of the whole ham, first use the slices for 
broiling, baked slice of ham, creamed ham and other dishes 
recjuiring slices or cubes of ham. Use the last half of the 
ham for baking in the piece. 



Bacon in the piece or car- 
tons of bacon should be kept on hand 
at all times. A breakfast of bacon 
and eggs is the accepted breakfast and may be quickly and 
easily prepared. A few strips of bacon add just the right 
flavor to the roast fowl, meat loaf, larded tenderloin, or 
casserole of vegetables or cereals. 

The drippings from ham and bacon should be kept in 
a cold place and used for shortening in spice cakes and 
cookies, for flavor in sauces for vegetables and meats, for 
sauteing where the smoked meat flavor is desirable, in the 
dressing for vegetable salads, and in the stuffing for fowl.

MILK THE COMPLETE FOOD 



Milk is nature's own food. It contains all the food 
elements necessary for body growth, protein, mineral salts, 
carbohydrates, fats, vitamines and water. It is the indis- 
pensable food for the young. It lends itself to a great 
variety of uses in the correct diet of the individual. Mod- 
em housekeeping demands that a supply of a quality brand 
of canned milk be in every pantry. 

As an addition to coffee or tea, evaporated milk has 
long been a recognized boon. Now, however, the conven- 
ience of this as a pantry staple for the country, town or 
city home cannot be overestimated. It is ever ready for 
the milk or cream call necessary to the completion of a 
perfect festive meal, or the easily digested milk toast or 
eggnog for the convalescent as well as the everyday bak- 
ing need. 

According to latest scientific experiments, the growth 
properties known as vitamines, so rich in milk, are in no 
way effected by the process of water elimination used to 
produce evaporated milk. 

Evaporated milk is a product of the greatest impor- 
tance to all families far removed from the source of a re- 
liable fresh milk supply. It is just the pure milk with a 
large part of the moisture removed. It contains all the 
natural butter fats, mineral salts, proteins, and solids of the 
fresh milkj Nothing is changed in evaporated milk except- 




ing the quantity of water in the fluid. For that reason, when 
canned milk is used to feed to children it is best to purchase 
a reliable brand of evaporated milk. Condensed milk is 
whole milk reduced by heating ; it differs from evaporated 
milk in that it has 40';^ to 44% sugar added. 

A high quality evaporated milk contains 26.16% solids 
and 69.247(1 water. A test of the keeping qualities of this 
product demonstrated that evaporated milk would keep 
sweet ten days after the can was opened. On souring 
it may be used the same as soured whole milk and with 
equally good results. 

To use evaporated milk as whole milk, it should be 
diluted in the proportion of one cup of evaporated milk to 
two and one-quarter cups of water. This will give a prod- 
uct averaging a rich whole milk. 

VARIETY Evaporated milk is most satisfactory for 
OF USES cream soups; for sauces for vegetables, fish 
and meats. Whipped for puddings( undiluted). 
Used diluted, it gives splendid results in cakes, muffins, 
biscuits and other flour mixtures. As cream for coffee, 
cocoa and chocolate, cereals, fruits and puddings it adds 
food value and flavor. As a beverage diluted with water 
or for eggnog it is just as satisfactory as ordinarj' milk for 
children. For ice creams and custards, cream candies and 
fudge it adds a smoothness and creaminess.

TISSUE BUILDING FOODS 



^^^-er 




TS^ 



CHEESE Cheese has an important mission in the dietary ; 
served as an accompaniment, it adds food 
value, flavor and distinction. In large quantities it may 
take the place in food value of the meat dish. It must, of 
course, be served in combination with vegetables or cereal 
food to supply the proper bulk. 

Cheese contains protein and fat. It builds tissue and 
creates heat and energy. For variety it may occasionally 
be served as the main food for a meal — and adds zest when 
used in salads and other table specialties. 

In fuel value, one pound of cheese is equal to three and 
one-third pounds of baked beans — or three quarts of whole 
milk, twenty-five average size eggs, or of peanut butter 
approximately three-fourths pounds. 

Popular cheese dishes are Spaghetti and Cheese, Maca- 
roni and Cheese, Cauliflower and Cheese au Gratin, Potatoes 
au Gratin, Melted Cheese Sandwiches, Cheese Crackers, 
Eggs au Gratin, Cheese Croquettes, etc. 

PEANUT BUTTER Peanut Butter is a highly concen- 
trated, rich food, containing protein, 
carbohydrates and fat, all in large proportion. For this 
reason it may be used as a main dish in the menu in 
proper combination. Peanut loaf, peanut soufl^e, peanut 
omelet, and peanut salad are fitting main dishes for the 
dinner or luncheon. 

In order to properly balance in the diet, peanut butter 
must be combined with foods of more bulk and less food 
value. Salad dressing and peanut butter make excellent 
sandwiches. Combined with tomato pulp and milk, peanut 




butter forms delicious soup. It may be used to flavor and 
to shorten cookies and drop cakes. It also adds to custards 
or salads. Due to its popular flavor, it also lends itself for 
use in the making of delicious confections. 

BEANS Beans are in the class with meat and cheese as 
protein food and may alternate with them as the 
main dish in the menu. They offer a variety to the menu 
served as bean loaf, souffle, croquettes, relish, salad, or as 
pur6e. 

The choicest commercially prepared pork and beans 
are made from selected double hand-picked Michigan pea 
beans with carefully selected government-inspected pork. 
They are cooked by the Appert Dry Steam Process, thereby 
blending and retaining all the delicious bean flavor. 

This dry steam process renders the beans more easily 
digestible than is possible for home-cooked beans. 

EGGS Eggs contain all of the elements necessary to 
life. Next to milk, selected eggs are the most 
economical source of animal protein and. like milk, con- 
tain the growth elements popularly known as fat soluble 
A. Vitamines. 

The highly concentrated food value of eggs makes it 
necessary to combine them with such starchy foods as bread 
or potatoes so that there will be sufficient bulk food for 
the stomach to act upon. Eggs are an excellent substitute 
for meat and are as indispensable as sugar in cooking. 
It is necessary to cook eggs slowly and at a low tempera- 
ture to have them easily digested.

THE TASTY SAUSAGE 




Delicately seasoned sausage, made of carefully selected 
Government-inspected meats, has a very definite place as a 
staple food. Sausage is all food, no waste, and most ap- 
petizing. The correctly blended seasonings of high-grade 
sausage, fresh, smoked or dry, start the gastric juices and 
act as an aid to digestion. 

FRESH PORK SAUSAGE 

Fresh pork sausage is very high in fuel value, the 
fat adding to the protein, heat and energy-pro- 
ducing material. This makes it essentially ^^^ 
a cold-weather food. The drippings should ^5^.. 
always be saved to use as a sauteing medium 
or shortening. 

HOW TO Fresh sausage, either links or bulk. Fry and 
SERVE serve with toast, pancakes or muffins, mashed 
potatoes, rice or hominy, for breakfast, dinner 
or luncheon. Stuff potatoes and apples with fresh pork 
sausage, bake and serve as a nutritive luncheon novelty. 

Tart fruit always adds to the meal of which fresh pork 
sausage is the main dish. 

SMOKED SAUSAGE 

Bologna and Frankfurters have gained wide reputation 
as dependable meats satisfactory for all informal occasions. 
They are made of pork, beef, and mutton. They are care- 
fully spiced with delicate mild spices. 

SUGGESTIONS Smoked sausage may be used for any 
FOR SERVING meal. The Bologna is preferable for 
luncheon dishes and picnics; the Frank- 
furters for any hot meal. 



Left-overs of either sausage may be made into such 
appetizing breakfast dishes as omelet, creamed sausage on 
toast or heated in the oven with mashed potatoes. 





Frankfurters offer many possibilities 



More than the best breakfas' 

DRY SAUSAGE 

As dry sausage is a product which originated across 
the water, American housewives are rapidly learning to 
appreciate its higher food value. Fresh U. S. Gov't in- 
spected meat cuts are selected and combined with the 
choicest seasonings and subjected to unique curing process- 
es, making this a most delicious food ready to eat. There is 
a wide variety to suit every taste. Recipes from Italy, 
France and the other foreign countries are followed or im- 
proved upon to make American dry sausage the superior 
food it is. 

Dry sausage may be made into a great variety of appe- 
tizing dishes or served sliced, cold. It is wholesome and 
nutritious. An attractively garnished platter of Dry Sausage 
is a favorite for a cold meal. 

Breakfast ; Creamed dry sausage with 
apple -fritters; diced and cooked in pan- 
cakes; stuffed into potatoes before bak- 
ing; or in fritters. 

Luncheon: Dry sausage cro- 
quettes, dry sausage sandwich; cheese 
and dry sausage rarebit; omelet au 
summer sausage. 

Dinner: Dry sausage dressing for 
fowl or meat, dry sausage stuffed in pep- 
pers, dry sausage with tomato sauce; pota- 
toes stuffed with dry sausage and cheese; 
dry sausage meat loaf; casserole of dry 
sausage and hominy. (Continued on page 20)

READY TO SERVE MEATS 




A.^ the many advantages of ready-cooked canned meats 
have become more generally known, their universal use 
has constantly increased, so that to-daythousands of house- 
wives maintain on their pantry shelves a variety of canned 
meats to supply all regular and emergency requirements. 

Meat was first put up in cans to prolong its keeping 
qualities, especially during the hot weather season. So uni- 
formly successful were these experiments that the original 
purpose has been almost forgotten, and canned meat now 
occupies an allyear-round prominent place in the national 
food supply. 

When canned meats are sold under a nationally known 
brand name, such as Armour's Veribest, you can be sure 
that the meats are carefully selected, U. S. Government in- 
spected, and prepared, cooked and seasoned in sanitary, scru- 
pulously clean kitchens by the most expert chefs. Complete 
sterilization, accompanied by a vacuum process of sealing, 
guarantees their perfect keeping qualities and enables the 
home manager to serve this meat on her table with all the deli- 
ciousness of meat prepared by the nation's most expert cooks. 

The cost per pound is a trifle higher than fresh meat, 
but it is already cooked, there is no shrinkage, it is 100% 
edible, and therefore can be served on the table at a rela- 
tively lower cost. Canned Meats served either hot or cold 
can be prepared in as many appetizing ways as fresh meat. 

The housewife should always buy canned meats by 
brand name; for the label, plus the U. S. Government In- 
spection stamp, is the safest buying guide that can be found. 

In every home where meals are served regularly it is a 
great convenience to have on the panti-y shelf a complete 
supply of canned meats, for it takes the guesswork out of 
cookery, saves time and labor, and assures the home 
manager of a successful meat dish for any regular or emer- 
gency meal. 

Any first-class dealer can supply you with a complete 
variety of high quality canned meats. 

Always read the label when buying and be sure to 
look for the U. S. Government inspected and passed legend 
on every can of meat you buy. 

MEAT LOAF 
Meat loaf is made from choice selected Government 
Inspected meats. Prepared commercially by chefs who 
daily use the same accurate measurements of beef and 
pork trimmings combined with macaroni, eggs, cheese and 
seasonings. The results are standard products. Whan 
whole, the loaves average about six pounds in weight

FATS FOR SPREADS AND COOKING 





A properly balanced diet 
contains a regular supply of 
fat. The ideal diet deter- 
mined by weight, height, 
occupation and general 
health of the individual 
contains just sufficient 
quantity of fat and carbo- 
hydrates to give the required 
amount of heat and energy. 
In popular terms, one-fifth of the diet should consist of tat. 
Much of this may be fat of vegetables or meats, but some 
of it should be butter fat or its equivalent, especially for 
children because of the vitamines it contains. Scientists 
agree that oleo oil also contains the growth - promoting 
elements. 

The necessity of fat in the diet has been proven by 
numerous experiments. Animals lacking certain fats do 
not grow and cannot reproduce. Disastrous results have 
attended nations where shortage of supplies made it im- 
possible to include the necessary fat in the diet. 

Fats supply a large part of the heat and energy re- 
quired, an ounce giving two and one-half times as much 
heat and energy as an ounce of carbohydrates. Butter, 
oleomargarine, nut margarines, pure leaf lard, bacon, salt 
pork, the fats of beef, mutton, pork and fowl, vegetable 
fats and oils and peanut butter are our principal sources 
of fat. A certain percentage is found in all nuts, cereals 
and vegetables. For the average healthy person fats are 
not difficult to digest if not taken in too large quantities 
and if the fat is properly used in the food. 

SPREADS 

Butter, oleomargarine, nut margarine and 
peanut butter are the spreads in general use. 
In a well balanced diet these may be 
used interchangeably. The food value is 
principally in the heat and energy 
furnished, which is practically equal 
in all the spreads. Butter and high- 
est grade oleomargarine contain 
certain growth elements not found 
in the nut butter, but milk or the 
average well varied diet corrects this. 

Butter is one of the best sources 
of fat for the daily diet. High grade creamery 



butter, such as Cloverbloom, is made in the heart of the rich 
dairy districts, from sweet pasteurized cream. 

. Oleomargarine has a well recognized place among 
spreads, due to a growing understanding among intelligent 
housewives as to its composition and the ideal conditions 
under which it is made. It is made by churning pure, sweet 
animal oils and vegetable oils in pasteurized milk and 
salting to taste. Since the housewife knows that materials 
used in oleomargarine are used daily in one form or an- 
other in her home and that it is given Government Inspec- 
tion,oleomargarine has become a most generally used spread. 

The vegetable or nut margarines are made from pure 
cocoanut and peanut oils churned in pasteurized milk. 
They are daily growing in public favor. The low moisture 
content of nut margarine and the care in preparation 
make it a rich and tasty spread. Nut-ola is the popular 
Armour nut margarine. 

Peanut butter, although used as a spread, has become 
universally known as one of our most excellent protein 
sources to replace meat. Easily digested, it is not only 
popular with adults, but a good food for children. 

THE PROPER FAT FOR EVERY COOKERY USE 

For shortening purposes, fats are used to improve the 
texture of the product. The fat in the mixture protects the 
starch grains from the moisture until the proper time in 
baking, allowing the leavening agent to act and the starch 
grains to swell, resulting in a light even-textured product. 
It is possible to use a 
great variety of fats for 
cooking. Animal fats 
ave been popular short- 
enings. Re-

Selecting Foods 



acquainted us with the value of.vegetable fats as shortening 
and in spreads. Armour's vegetable fat is Vegetole. It 
contains the same fuel value and has the same shortening 
value as lard. Pure Leaf Lard or vegetable fats are the 
ideal shortenings. Salad Oil, highly refined vegetable fat, 
Oleomargarine, Nut-ola, butter, and drippings from bacon, 
ham, beef and pork are used with entire satisfaction for 
shortening purposes. 

The fats best suited to deep frying and saut^ing are 
those which have a very high burning point. For general 
" all purpose " satisfaction, pure leaf lard ranks first. There 
is an Armour product especisdly suited to every cookery 
need. 

FATS 

Bacon drippings may be substituted for lard in frying, 
baking, or in gravies, providing the drippings are clarified 
and not too strong. A great many people prefer the flavor 
of bacon drippings to any other shortening. 

Beef suet drippings, for reheating meats or for frying 
or shortening purposes, take the place of lard and are much 
more economical. 

Pork fat, left from roast, chops or ham, can be used in 
the same manner. 

Mutton drippings need no longer be set aside, since 
the housewife has learned how to sweeten them. 

Smoky kitchens indicate the improper use of fat in 
cooking. Too high a temperature causes a chemical chsmge 
to take place which results in smoke and disagreeable odor, 
and also renders the fat less digestible. 

Put cold fat into a cold pan before placing it over the 
heat. Bringing into contact with the hot pan frequently 
results in burning the fat. 

For deep frying and saut^ing, care should be taken not 
to heat the fat to too high a temperature, as burning de- 
composes the fat and renders it less digestible. In deep 
fat frying, place the food to be fried in the hot fat a small 
amount at a time. The addition of the cold food reduces 
the .temperature of the fat. 

Do not pile fried articles. Drain on unglazed paper. 

Strain fat after using, save, and use again. 

FOODS When fat is not hot enough, when mixture 

SOAK FAT is too rich, when mixture is too moist, and 
when too much soda or baking powder has 
been used, deep-fried foods will take up too much fat and 
be greasy. 

TEST FOR A piece of soft bread will brown in 40 

TEMPERATURE seconds in deep fat that is just hot 

enough for cooked articles, or in 60 

seconds in fat at the right temperature for uncooked foods. 

Fat is too hot if it smokes. 



TO CLARIFY To clarify the frying medium for second 
FAT or third use, melt, add raw potato cut in 

quarter inch slices, and allow to heat 
gradually; when it ceases to bubble and the potatoes are 
well browned, strain through double cheesecloth, placed 
over the wire strainer into a pan. 

SALAD OIL USED IN COOKING 
Vegetable salad oil meets all the requirements for a 
rich, delicately flavored oil for salad dressing. Highly re- 
fined cottonseed oil and cocoanut oil are American products, 
made from highly refined vegetable oil. Both have proved 
entirely satisfactory and economical as salad oil. Highly 
refined cottonseed oil for frying has a high smoking point, 
and, properly used, gives off no unpleasant odor.

FRUITS TO COMPLETE THE MEAL 



The dietetic value of fruits 
lies in the fruit sugar, mineral 
salts, and organic acids which 
they contain. Fruits are body regulators. 

Fruit sugar or carbohydrates are the chief sources of 
fuel value in fruit. Most fruits also contain the substance 
which is necessary for jelly making. A fruit which does 
not contain pectin, such as pears and pineapple, must be 
combined with some fruit containing pectin. Apples, 
grapes, and currants contain great quantities of pectin. 

Fresh fruit eaten the first thing in the morning acts as 
a cleanser. Care must be taken in the selection of fruit, 
it should be ripe, but not overripe. If overripe, it is liable 
to cause fermentation in the alimentary tract. 

Science has perfected the drying process to such a 
degree that dried fruit has become a great convenience 
when the fresh product is not obtainable. 

Because it is impossible to wholly consume all fruits 
at the harvesting time, great quantities are canned for 
later consumption. To retain the highest natural flavor 
and full fruit sugar value, it is necessary to can fruits and 
vegetables just as they ripen and immediately after picking. 
Commercial canning of fruits has reached such a high de- 
gree of excellence that the average home manager prefers 
to buy a reliable brand she knows to be uniform, rather 
than run the risk of having fruits spoil that she uses her 
own time and material to "put up." 

The wide variety of fruits on the market under reliable 
brand names makes it possible to serve practically any 
fruit at any season. Even the special types of fruits may 
be purchased canned, as Royal Anne Cherries, Muscat 
Grapes, Bartlett Pears, Egg Plums, etc.

VEGETABLES 

Vegetables contain a large amount of water, cellulose, 
and mineral matter. They are included under the classi- 
fication of carbohydrates, or mineral salts according to the 
predominance of starch or mineral matter. Leafy vege- 
tables are rich in vitamines. 




The mineral salts afford 
bone building material, while 
the large amount of cellulose 
which they contain furnishes bulk in the diet. 

Canned vegetables are preserved by sterilization. Salt 
is used to bring out the flavor, acts as a preservative, and 
increases the mineral content. 

Dried vegetables are being used in soups and ragouts. 
The dried vegetables have not yet reached as extensive 
use as have the dried fruits. 

Commercially canned vegetables add year round 
variety to practically every American table. The selection 
of a reliable brand simplifies the marketing. 

The Vegetables to Serve with Various Meats 
Tomatoes — Broiled Steak, Lamb Chops. Asparagus 
— Planked Steak, Roast Beef, Lamb Chops, Veal Chops. 
Spinach — Ham, Tongue, all meats, eggs, fish. Peas — 
Lamb Chops, Chicken, Meat croquettes. String Beans — 
Ham, Boiled Lamb, Chicken. Okra — Chicken, Tuna, Ham. 
Celery — Cheese Dishes. 
All vegetables combine in vegetable casseroles and salads. 

MINCE Mince Meat nearly conforms to the requisites 
MEAT of a perfect food. It contains protein from the 
meat content, carbohydrates, both sugar and 
starch in the form of fruits, and moisture. Spices and 
flavoring make it complete. Its fuel value is considerable. 
It should not merely be used as a holiday food, but as an 
all year round product. 

Mince meat contains only the best and most whole- 
some ingredients. On the market are two varieties, the 
condensed and moist. Moist mince meat requires more 
attention because of its aptness to ferment. In making it, 
green apples and fresh cider are used. As cider makes 
vinegar and raisins and currants make wine, fermentation 
is possible. This does not mean that the mince meat is no 
longer good. The alcohol formed acts as a preservative. 

Concentrated mince meat contains dried apples and 
boiled cider. In this respect only does it differ from moist 
mince meat. By the addition of water, the condensed 
becomes equal to moist. Condensing is done merely to aid 
in packing and delivery. 

VARIETY OF USES 

Pie Patties, Brown Bread and Mince Meat Sandwich, 
Pudding, Tomato stuffed with Mince Meat, Mince Meat 
Salad, Mince Meat Relish, Mince Meat Cookies.

THE PANTRY STOCK 

Perhaps one of the greatest simple helps toward a well-ordered home is a well-stocked pantry. With this to rely 
upon, one is always ready for any demand that can interfere with the regular plans of the household. 

Besides a carefully selected assortment of quality foods already prepared, a number of menus and the recipes 
to accompany them should be easily accessible, so that in case the home-manager herself is away from home or is ill, 
almost any member of the family can keep the meals going satisfactorily. 

The pantry shelf should contain CANNED soups, fish, meats, milk, vegetables, fruits; jams, jellies, condiments, a few 
packages of cookies and crackers. A few cans of evaporated milk come in handy, even on the farm, now and 
then, and will keep until needed. 

Let the Armour Housewives' Choosing List be your guide in stocking this shelf. When a package is used, 
replace it at once so that the shelf will be ready for all staple and emergency calls, sure to come when least expected. 
During the warm months, many of the foods illustrated on pages 24-25 will be kept in the refrigerator.

Selecting Foods 





Cookery, to meet the present day standards, is necessarily 

an art and a science. (See page 46 for measures and abbreviations.) 

Skill in blending flavors, and arranging dishes to please the eye as well 

as the palate, is an art of which every home manager may be proud. Still more important, however, is the scientific 

preparation of nutritious and economical dishes to supply the body needs of every member of the family. 

In these pages devoted to cookery we have covered important cookery points which influence the palatability, 
digestibility, and combination of materials for best results. Our aim is to present to the American home manager a 
valuable cooking manual, not a recipe book. Below are listed many splendid books of recipes in your public library:

SOUPS 



Prepare soup stock in a kettle which will retain heat. 
Fit with a tight cover, for the vapors must be held in to 
add to the flavor of the stock. Shank and neck of beef, 
pork or lamb, left-over morsels of meat, bones from steaks, 
roasts, chops and the carcasses of poultry, are good materi- 
als from which to make meat stock. 

Crack and saw bones to uniform size, put into kettle 
and add cold water in the proportion of three cups 
of cold water to one pound of bones. 

Let stand for one-half hour or until water is 
colored by juices, heat to boiling point. Skim off 
fat, reduce heat and let simmer or bubble slowly 
for four hours. The stock must be kept at low 
temperature in cooking so that the albumen or 
jelly of the meat will not coagulate, but be retained 
in the stock, giving it full flavor. 

Cook until the meat is shredded and colorless. 
When nearly done, add vegetables and seasoning. 
Strain, set stock aside to cool - discard bones, re- 
serving vegetables and meat portions, which are 
still rich in food value, for further use in pressed loaves. 
A bit of Extract of Beef will add the desired meat flavor. 



Stock is used as the foundation for all meat and vege- 
table soups. Cream soups have white sauce as a founda- 
tion with the vegetable pur^e added. 
CANNED SOUPS So much time is consumed in prepar- 
ing soup that the great variety of high 
quality canned soups are a welcome addition to Madam 
Home Manager's Labor Savers.

MEAT COOKERY 




(See pages 7, 8 and 9 for Meat Charts) 

To be sure of success in meat cookery, know first the structure of the 
cut of meat you are to prepare, then use a standard tested method for making 
that cut tender, fiavory and juicy. 

Always have a good fire before placing meat over the heat, for all meat cookery requires the greatest heat first to 
seal the appetizing juices in. Your skill will be shown in your first ten minutes of handling. 

The short fibered cuts comprising the loin cuts, porterhouse, and club steaks may be given the entire short cooking 
over a hot fire. Practically all the other cuts on the carcass require long moist cooking after the searing process. 

All boiling pieces should be put into boiling water first and after ten minutes' brisk boiling, the heat should be re- 
duced so that the meat simmers until the connective tissue softens and the meat is tender and just right for carving. 
Too long brisk boiling makes the meat stringy. Roasts should be cooked on the same principle. Put into the hot oven 
for fifteen minutes, then reduce the heat and cook the cut slowly, basting frequently. Steaks and chops that are to be 
pan broiled, should be put on a hot pan and quickly turned so as to sear and brown evenly, then allowed to cook through, 
over the hot fire. As salt draws the juices out of meats it should not be added until after the first ten or fifteen minutes 
of cooking, when the meat is thoroughly seared. 



METHODS 
BROILING This process of cooking subjects the meat, 
fish or poultry to the direct rays of the fire, 
quickly searing and browning the meat; this is the approved 
method of cooking tender steaks and chops, fish and spring 
chicken. An intense, even heat is necessary. 
PAN BROILING A very hot frying pan is used without 
addition of any fat ; chops and steaks 
are cooked in this way. 

ROASTING Roasting is oven cooking in an uncov- 

AND BAKING ered pan. Baking differs only in the fact 
that the pan is covered, thus making the 
cooking self basting. Prime ribs, loin or leg, and fowl, are 
roasted; rump, short ribs and shoulder are frequently baked. 
POT Wipe the meat, dredge with flour and brown 

ROASTING the entire surface in a little fat, place the 
meat on a rack in a deep kettle and cover 
with boiling water. Cook with vegetables and seasoning, 
adding vegetables at intervals to allow for the perfect 
cooking of each class of vegetables by the time the meat 
is done. Place cover on kettle and simmer slowly about 
four hours. Serve with the thickened liquor. 

BOILING Cooking in liquid at 212° F. is boiling. Meat 
should never be boiled rapidly, as the fibers be- 
come tough and the tissues dissolved. To have boiled meats 
tasty and juicy, plunge the meat into boiling water and 
cook for ten minutes, then lower the heat and cook slowly 
until tender. An excellent way to cook shank,clod, shoulder 
plate, brisket or neck. A fireless cooker is practical for 



this type of cookery. A pressure cooker makes it possible 
to cook a tough fowl or cut of meat in a very short time. 
BRAISING Cooking in a closely covered pan in the oven 

is termed braising; a small amount of water 
is used. The meat is usually sauteed first, to prevent es- 
cape of much juice. Vegetables are often cooked with the 
meat. The temperature should be kept low. It is an ex- 
cellent way for cooking spareribs, brisket, rump, shoulder 
or chuck roast. Besides stewing or boiling, it is an excellent 
way to prepare the tough cuts. 

SAUTEING f 3" frying in just enough fat to brown the 
foods nicely and keep them from sticking 
to the pan is called sauteing. Fish, steaks, chops and po- 
tatoes are cooked by this method. 
STEWING Meat for a stew, such as neck, clod, shank, 

brisket or chuck, can be cut in small pieces, 
browned to hold in juices before cooking in the boiling 
water; or, omitting that process, put directly in a small 
amount of hot water and cooked at a low temperature for 
a long time. All nutriment is retained in the meat. 
DEEP FRYING ^'^'^ this method of cooking, an iron 
kettle is best. Half fill the kettle with 
fat and place over fire ; melt and, when a slight blue vapor 
arises, test with a small cube of bread. If bread browns in 
one minute, the temperature is right for uncooked mixtures 
(doughnuts). If it browns in forty seconds, it is right for 
cooked materials (croquettes). The temperature of the 
fat should average 350-400 degrees F. Keep the temperature 
even ; if too cool, the food will soak fat ; if too hot, both fat 
and material to be cooked will bum. Foods cooked in deep 
fat should be drained on brown paper.

STEAKS 

BROILED SIRLOIN STEAK 

Serves 6-7. Preparation 10 minutes. 
3^ lbs. steak '. p tsp. pepper 

% tsp. salt 2 tbsp. butter 

Wipe meat with cloth wrung out of cold water. Re- 
move superfluous fat and use to grease the broiler. Have 
broiler very hot. Place meat on broiler about three inches 
from the heat, which should be even, whether it is coal, 
gas or el jctricity. Turn meat every 
ten seconds at first, that the sur- 
face may be well seared and prevent 
the escape of the juices. 

Steak I'z inches thick will re- 
quire 10 minutes if desired rare, 12 
to 15 minutes if preferred well done. 

PLANKED RUMP STEAK 

Serves 5-6. Preparation 25 minutes.

minutes. Grease an oak plank and arrange, close to the 



edge, a border of mashed potatoes, pressed through a pas- 
try bag. Remove steak to plank, put into a hot oven, and 
bake until steak is cooked and potatoes are browned. 
Spread steak with butter, salt and pepper, and garnish with 
parsley, lemon and olives. Arrange beets and other vege- 
tables, if desired, on the side. 

MEAT SAUCES AND GRAVY 

Use the meat juices left from cooked meat or fowl, 
removing any excess fat. Extract of beef may be substi- 
tuted for meat juices in gravy. 

After removing meat and excess fat from the roasting 
pan or skillet, heat meat juices to boiling and thicken care- 
fully. To avoid lumpy gravy, the best way is to mix the 
flour with a small amount of water, stirring until smooth, 
then gradually adding more cold water until the thickening 
is of the right consistency. Add gradually to the hot liquid, 
stirring constantly. 

Allow mixture to cook ten minutes. Gravy should be 
cooked thoroughly to avoid any raw or starchy taste, too 
common to American gravies. 

Season carefully, according to the meats gravy is to be 
served with. It is wise to taste before serving. 

The distinctive touch French chefs are noted for in 
their meat and fish dishes is often due to the sauce accom- 
panying them. Any careful American cook can acquire 
the same reputation for skill by following the suggestions 
to cook thoroughly and season distinctively.

HOW TO COOK POULTRY ■ 



(See pages 13 and 40) 




SELECTION OF YOUNG FOWL 



The flesh of young fowl is smooth. The claws and 
feet are usually light yellow in color and are very supple. 
A breastbone which bends easily indicates young fowl. 
Fowl should be plump, but not over plump. If fowl is ex- 
ceptionally fat at the crop, it indicates large inner organs. 
They weigh heavily, and therefore are poor purchases. 

PREPARATION FOR COOKERY 

Care should be taken that the fowl is drawn and 
thoroughly cleansed. This is often attended to by the 
local butcher, but special care and attention is also needed 
in the home. 

The pin feathers must all be removed and the fowl 
singed. AH blood clots, portions of lungs, etc., should be 
removed. Hold fowl under faucet, and let water from 
faucet rush through it to remove any clinging portions, 

TERMS USED IN SELECTING FOWL 
Chicken — Term applied to fowls under ten months. 
Broilers — Young spring chickens about six months old. 
Fowl — Term includingchicken, turkey, goose and duck. 
Pullet — Young hen. Term including fowl up to the 
age of one year. 

Capon — Specially fattened male chicken. 

METHODS OF COOKING 
ROASTING Chicken and turkey being dry meat, require 

frequent bastings. The grease which ac- 
cumulates in the roasting of geese must be poured off 
from time to time. This should be clarified and carefully 
saved for use in pastries and as spreads. Strips of salt 
pork or bacon if placed across turkey or chicken baste 
the fowl as well as flavor it. 

STEWING Older fowl is best when stewed. The fowl 
should be put into boiling water, seasoning 
added, and gently cooked at the simmering point for sev- 
eral hours before the vegetables are added. Cook until the 
meat is very tender. Add dumplings the last twenty 
minutes. 

BROILING Fowl that is to be broiled should be brushed 

well with oil and allowed to stand in oool 

place some time before broiling. Sprinkling with lemon 



juice also tends to make it tender as well as flavors the fowl. 
Strips of bacon laid across the top baste the fowl. Turn 
frequently to insure thorough cooking. 

FRYING Select young fowl for frying. Long, slow cook- 
ing is needed to thoroughly cook the fowl. The 
portions are dipped in egg and crumbs to protect them 
from the high heat of the pan and so keep them tender. 
Use a shallow griddle and add bacon fat as necessary. 

DRESSING In order that the legs, wings, and neck of 
A FOWL fowl will not dry out, it is well to truss the 
fowl for roasting. 
Fold back the wings so that they form a "V" on the 
back. Fold the neck back so that it fits beneath the wings. 
Fasten with twine. Bend back legs and fasten them close 
to the rump. Also fasten joints close to the body. If 
dressing is to be used, stuff in body and then sew up the 
openings. A trussing or darning needle threaded with 
twine makes the matter of trussing quite simple. 

FROZEN If fowl is purchased frozen, thaw in pan of 
FOWL cold water or place in refrigerator for six 
hours and then dress in the usual manner. 
Frozen fowl handled by a nationally recognized food or- 
ganization has been carefully selected and possesses a 
delicate flavor. 

PRESSURE Fowl may be fried or stewed in the pressure 
COOKERY cooker. The foods are made ready as in 
OF FOWL the ordinary method and are placed in the 
bottom of the cooker. Vegetables or cere- 
als may be placed on the rack above and cooked at the 
same time. The lid is then adjusted and the pressure 
raised to about 18 pounds and then kept there for thirty 
minutes. Fowl that is old is quickly cooked tender in a 
pressure cooker. 

WAYS OF SERVING LEFT-OVER FOWL

SALADS 



Salads are combinations of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, 
or fruits and nuts with a dressing. 

Mayonnaise should not be added to salad until just 
before serving, as it may liquefy. It is most satisfactory 
to mix each ingredient in a fruit or vegetable salad with the 
dressing separately and combine at the last moment 

Green vegetables, such as lettuce, should not have 
dressing added until just before serving. 

The flavor of meat and fish salads is improved by mar- 
inating in French dressing before combining with other 
materials. 

CARE OF MATERIALS

SOME HEARTY MEAT SUBSTITUTES 



EGGS 

Although hens' eggs are more commonly in use, the 
eggs of ducks, geese, guinea fowl and turkeys are all used 
as food. 

USES The various uses of eggs in cooking may be listed 
as follows: 



1 As a substitute for meat 

2 To clear soup and coffee 

3 To thicken sauces, etc. 

4 To make certain foods light, 

omelet, souffles 



5 As a garnish 

6 To improve flavor 

7 To color certain foods 

8 To glaze breads, rolls, etc. 

9 As a leavening agent in baking 



PRINCIPLES In cooking eggs, heat produces a change 
OF COOKERY in both color and in firmness, the firm- 
ness, or hardness, depending on the 
temperature and length of time cooked. The change 
which takes place in the egg albumen is called coagula- 
tion. A high temperature for any continued length of 
time will produce a leathery consistency, which necessi- 
tates a longer time for digestion. 

Soft -cooked eggs digest more quickly and more satis- 
factorily than do eggs prepared any other way. 

The margin is slight, however, and the stomach takes 
care of all kinds of cooked eggs.

HOW TO As there is a harvest time for eggs, it is nec- 
PRESERVE essary to insure eggs for year around use 
by preserving a supply for winter release. 
Preserve only fresh clean eggs in the spring and early 
summer when they are cheap and plentiful. They may be 
preserved in any of the following virays : 

1 Commercial cold storage is the most satisfactory method of pre- 

serving eggs. 

2 Pack in sawdust, salt, bran or sand, with small end down. 

3 Cover with salt brine, limewater or water glass. 

4 Coat with lard, oil or paraffin. 




CHEESE 
PRINCIPLES Cheese is sufficiently cooked when melt- 
OF COOKERY ed. Protein is toughened by a high 
temperature, therefore a low tempera- 
ture process should always be used in preparing cooked 
cheese dishes. 

Cheese should be kept dry and covered, but never 
wholly exclude the air. If spread with melted paraffin, 
it will keep moist. Soft cheese should be kept in the ice 
box. The receptacle for cheese should be thoroughly steri- 
lized before new cheese is placed in it. 

Cheese gives character to many nourishing but indis- 
tinct-flavored foods.

Melt the oleomargarine, add the flour and when well 
mixed add gradually the scalded milk. Then add salt, 
cayenne and cheese. Remove from the fire and add the 
yolks of eggs, beaten until lemon colored. Cool the mix- 
ture and fold into the whites, beaten until stiff. Pour into 
a buttered baking dish and cook twenty minutes in a slow 
oven. Serve at once. Cheese souflli is suitable as the 
main dish for luncheon, dinner or supper. 

CHEESE SAUCE 

Serves 5. Preparation 20 minutes: 
2 c. medium white sauce 1 c. grated cheese 

Make a medium white sauce. To each cup of sauce 
add half a cup of grated cheese and cook in double boiler 
until melted. 

Use as a sauce over macaroni, spaghetti, rice, hominy, 
escalloped vegetable dishes, over toast as mock rarebit, or 
as a foundation for cream of cheese soup.

VEGETABLE COOKERY 




Fresh vegetables should be whole and sound when 
purchased. Roots and tubers require special care as to 
cleanliness. Perishable vegetables should be used as soon 
as purchased. If kept for any length of time, they should be 
stored in a cool, dry place. From time to time, they 
should be looked over and those which show signs of de- 
cay, removed. 

PREPARATION FOR COOKING 

The first step is cleansing. Wash thoroughly in cold 
water and then pick over or scrub with a vegetable brush to 
thoroughly remove any small portions of dirt that may be 
embedded in the outer covering or hidden among the leaves. 
Remove all leaves, tops, etc. The ideal way, from a food 
value standpoint, is to cook potatoes with the skins on, for, 
if pared, the valuable mineral salts escape into the water. 
Vegetables that are pared before cooking should be pared 
very thin. Between the skin and outer layers of the vege- 
table lies a layer containing much nutritive material, and, 
unless the parings are thin, this material is lost. Water in 
which pared vegetables are cooked should be saved and 
used as soup stock. 

METHODS OF COOKING 

BOILING Vegetables should be cooked in boiling water. 
Strong smelling vegetables, such as cabbage, 
onions, etc., will not give off strong odors if cooked in 
plenty of water and uncovered. Other vegetables should 
be cooked in just enough water to cover and the kettle 
should be covered. Salt, however, toughens the fiber and, 
for this reason, is only used in the cooking of young, 
tender shoots. For the older vegetables the salt may be 
added just before serving. 

STEAMING Steaming is a very satisfactory method of 
cooking vegetables. The vegetables are 
placed on racks in the steamer and cooked until tender. 
None of the juices are lost, the fiber is not toughened, and 
the appesu^ance and shape of the vegetables are preserved. 

BAKING Vegetables may be washed, and baked in a 
moderate oven until the skin bursts. This 
method of cooking is satisfactory in that no nutriment is 
lost. The vegetables classed as roots, such as turnips, 
parsnips, etc., may be baked, but are less suited to this 
method of cooking.

GARNISHES 

Garnishes of vegetables are often used to give a color- 
ful touch to meat dishes. A little sprig of parsley is often 
sufficient decoration. Clever garnishes are made by means 
of vegetable cutters. These are attractive additions when 
used as a border around a meat dish. 

Lettuce is used extensively as a garnish. It is used 
most commonly as a garnish for cold meats.

Cake is judged by its delicate flavor, 
fine grain or texture, evenly baked crust, 
and appearance. Special pastry flour 
assures a more delicate texture than 
bread flour in cake making. 

PROPORTION AND USE OF 
MATERIALS 

Salt is used to bring out flavor. 
Quantity used should be according to 
amount of butter present. When nuts 
are used, the amount of salt should be 
increased slightly to bring out flavor. 
When chocolate or cocoa is used, de- 
crease the amount of fat, as there is a 
certain amount of fat in the cocoa and 
chocolate. (Continued on page 37)

Use Armour's Veribest Oleomargarine for cake making 



Cookery Section 




PASTRIES 




PLAIN PASTRY 

In plain pastry the shortening is mixed into the flour by 
chopping or with tips of fingers. All ingredients and uten- 
sils should be cold. When the lard is thoroughly chilled a 
large amount of ice-water can be incorporated, which, when 
converted into steam, acts as a leavening agent and makes 
the pastry light and fluffy. 

PUFF PASTE 

In puff paste the shortening is worked into a paste 
of flour and water by folding and rolling. Equal parts by 
weight of flour and shortening are used. 

MATERIALS 

Pure leaf lard is the ideal shortening for pastry mak- 
ing. It makes a light colored, soft, tender crust. Pure 
leaf lard is made only of leaf fat rendered in open kettles 
by a special process which makes the resulting product 
extremely rich and delicate. 

Vegetole may be successfully used, following the same 
methods as with lard. Vegetole is an absolutely pure vegeta- 
ble fat, processed to proper cooking consistency without 
anything being added. It may be secured in a sanitary 
pail in convenient size for home use. 

Butter and oleomargarine are especially desirable for 
puff paste. A fine pastry or cake flour will absorb moisture 
least and is therefore one of the first requisites to pastry 
making. A small quantity of baking powder insures light- 
ness to pie paste, but is not an essential to the product of 
an expert. 

RULES Everything must be cold, handled lightly and 
quickly and baked in a hot oven, to assure deli- 
cate pastry. To prevent escape of juice, mix cornstarch or 
flour with sugar and sprinkle lightly over the fruit before 
covering with the top crust. Press the edges of the upper and 
lower crusts tightly together. A cone of paper or piece of 
macaroni may be put into the slit of the crust to allow the 
escape of steam. 

FRENCH PASTRY 

French pastries are nationally popular and are very 
attractive for tea or fancy dessert service. The maker 
has wide scope for the display of individuality in devising 
and decorating pastries. Slices of jelly roll, loaf or sponge 
cake may be spread with mocha frosting to form individ- 
ual cakes. Fruit-filled tarts, topped with a bit of meringue, 
are always popular. The real French pastry is made of puff 
paste, very tender and flaky, and filled with fruit. 



CAKE MAKING (Continued from page 36) 

LEAVENING AGENTS 

Baking powder, soda and eggs are used as leavening 
agents; this is to make the cake light. If the number of 
eggs is increased in the cake recipe, decrease the amount 
of baking powder. One egg is equivalent to one teaspoon 
baking powder in leavening. Egg atid milk together 
should not exceed IK cups liquid with three cups flour. 
SHORTENING 

A large amount of fat makes a cake close-grained ; a 
small amount makes it porous, but it dries out easily. With 
too much fat, the cake crumbles and it maybe heavy. If 
melted fat is used in a cake, add it cool. If added hot, the 
cake will be tough, coarse in grain and less light. 
LIQUID 

If water is substituted for milk, use seven-eighths cup of 
water where one cup of milk is called for. If Veribest 
Evaporated Milk is substituted for whole milk, use one-third 
cup of evaporated milk and two-thirds cup of water. If 
cream is substituted for milk, lessen the shortening and 
use more cream than the milk called for. 

USE OF SOUR OR SWEET MILK 

Soda and acid both act on gluten and tend to make it 
tender, so cakes made with sour milk or buttermilk will be 
more tender than those made with water or sweet milk. 
One scant teaspoonful of soda is necessary to neutralize a 
cup of buttermilk or milk of the same sourness as butter- 
milk. An excess of soda gives the product an unpleasant 
flavor and, if present in too large a quantity, is injurious as 
well. 

Sour evaporated milk is very useful in cookery. Dilute 
it as when sweet and add the necessary amount of soda 
to the product in which it is to be used. 

Muffins, griddle cakes and biscuits are better made 
with sour milk than with sweet milk. Every bit of sour 
evaporated milk may be used in this way. 

Evaporated milk does not sour quickly because of the 
thorough sterilization in heating to the temperature neces- 
sary for evaporation. 

A quality grade of evaporated milk will keep after 
being open some four days before souring in warm weather 
and over a week in cold weather. 

Foods made with sour milk are characterized by a 
particular softness of texture. 



Use Armour's "Simon Pure" Leaf Lard or Vegetole for particular pastry making

CEREALS AND FRUITS 



Cereals are economical, contain unusually good pro- 
portions of necessary food ingredients with small proportion 
of refuse, are readily prepared for the table, palatable, 
digestible, compact, and easily preserved without 
deterioration. 

Rolled oats is perhaps the best-known of the cereals 
and lends itself to the greatest variety of dishes, aside from 
its popular use as a breakfast food. 

Com flakes are manufactured of the best pure white 
corn, thoroughly toasted and ready to serve. Wheat flakes 
are the whole wheat berry, flaked and toasted. 

Macaroni, spaghetti, and egg noodles are made from 
Durum wheat semolina, ground fine. Eggs are added to 
the cereal for noodles. 

Hominy grits and whole hominy are favorite American 
breakfast cereals and combine well with other foods as the 
main dish for the meal. 

Among the staple food products, rice is one of the least 
expensive and should appear frequently on the family bill 
of fare. 

Thorough cooking is the secret of the tasty and easily 
digested dish of cereal. Cereals in bread, muffins, cookies, 
cakes, croquettes, and in casseroles with cheese, fish, or 
left-over meat; in the baking dish with a slice of ham, or 
with a vegetable, they give variety to the menu and make 
the preparation of the everyday dishes more interesting.

Stir cereals gradually into required quantity of boiling 
water, allowing one teaspoon salt to each cup of cereal. Fine 
granular cereals may be mixed first with a small amount 
of cold water to prevent lumping, then add boiling water. 
Stir flaky cereals with a fork. Cook rapidly at first over 
flame five or ten minutes, then in double boiler. For pre- 
pared cereals, allow plenty of time to cook thoroughly as 
their palatability and ease of digestion depend largely on 
this. 

For variety, stir figs, dates or marmalade into cereals 
before serving. Serve with canned fruits, baked apples, 
or fresh fruits sliced over the cereal. 

Cold cooked cereals may be sliced, dipped in flour, or 
in eggs and crumbs and fried. In preparing corn meal 
mush for frying, a little flour added to the corn meal will 
make it slice more easily. 



SERVE MORE FRUITS 



During the season when fruits are plentiful serve them 
plain, uncooked and well ripened. Small fruits and berries 
should be thoroughly chilled. All fruits should be washed 
and drained or wiped before serving. To wash berries, 
place in a colander and pour water over them, handling 
as little as possible. If washed under the faucet turn to a 
small stream. Wash strawberries before removing the 
stems, otherwise they will become water soaked. 

CANNED FRUITS 
Serve canned fruits with their juices as a dessert for 
luncheon and dinner, as an appetizer for breakfast, in 
cocktails for dinner, and in various desserts in which fruit 
is used as a base. The flavor of canned fruit is improved 
by removing from the can to a dish and allowing to stand 



in the air one hour before using. The juice which is not 
served with the fruit should be used in fruit gelatins, 
sauces, or drinks. Do not waste any fruit juice. 

Certain fruit juices contain a neutral substance called 
pectin, which, when properly cooked, causes them to solidify 
or jell. In this form much of our excess fruit and juices 
are preserved. Apples, grapes, currants, cranberries, and 
plums are the best known jell makers. 

GRAPEFRUIT AND ORANGE 

In preparing grapefruit to serve, chill the fruit 
thoroughly, cut in two crosswise, remove the seeds with a 
sharp pointed knife, remove the center, and. slipping the 
knife down between rind and pulp, loosen all around with- 
out cutting the tissue.

BREAD MAKING 



{Also see page 40) 




Bread can be made out of flour, water, yeast, and salt, 
but usually a little fat and sugar are added to give addition- 
al food value and flavor. Milk when used in place of water 
makes a more nutritious bread, and the crust has a more 
appetizing appearance. 

Hard wheat flour, which is made from spring wheat 
and contains a high percentage of gluten, is best for bread 
making. Winter or soft wheat flour is used where a lighter, 
more flaky product is desired. 

QUALITIES Good bread is sometimes described as po- 
OF GOOD rous or containing a large number of holes, 
BREAD all about the same size and shape. A loaf 

of bread should be light in weight accord- 
ing to its size and should be elastic and have a s'.Tnmetrical 
form and an unbroken golden crust. 

POINTS TO 1. Use dependable materials and correct 
REMEMBER utensils. 

2. Cleanliness. Exactness of proportions, 
measuring, mixing and molding. 

3. Set bread to rise in a warm place. Keep it warm while 
rising. 

4. Adjust oven temperature high at first to form crust, 
then medium and steady. 

5. Cool loaves without steaming. 

BAKING Baking bread (1) kills the ferment (2) makes 
starch soluble (3) drives off the alcohol and 
carbon dioxide (4) forms brown crust of pleasant flavor. 
Bread should be baked 45 minutes -1 hour in a moderate 
oven at a temperature of 350°-400.° If the oven is too 
hot, the crust will brown too quickly before the center of 
the bread is baked. The flrst fifteen minutes of the baking, 
the loaves should continue rising, then should brown and 
continue browning for the next twenty minutes. The last 
fifteen minutes should finish the baking. 

After baking, the loaves should be removed from the 
pans at once, and turned on their side on a wire bread or 
cake cooler. If a solt crust is desired, brush with butter and 
cover; if a crisp crust is preferred, allow the bread to cool 
without covering. 



tablespoons of sugar or molasses. When cooled to luke- 
warm, add one-third a cake of compressed yeast, softened 
and mixed with half a cup of lukewarm water, three cups 
of whole wheat flour and two of white flour. Mix with a 
knife to a dough, adding as much more flour as is required 
to make a dough that may be kneaded. Knead until 
smooth and elastic. Wash and butter the mixing bowl ; in 
it put the dough, carefully cover and set aside out of 
draughts. When the dough is doubled in bulk, cut down 
and shape into two loaves. When again nearly doubled 
in bulk bake one hour.

SMOTHERED CHICKEN 

Serves 4. Preparation 1 hour 20 minutes. Inexpensive in season. 

1 chicken Water Parsley 

Seasonings Flour I tablespoon lard 

This is a most delicate and palatable way of cooking 
chicken. After cleaning the young chicken, split down 
the back and dredge with salt and pepper. Put a table- 
spoonful of lard into the frying pan, and, when it is hot, 
add the chicken. Cook over slow fire fifteen minutes, then 
add a half cup of water, and set back on the stove, and let 
it simmer gently and steadily for about an hour. .Serve 
with a garnish of chopped parsley. Some smother the 
chicken in butter, but this is according to taste. 



CORN FRITTERS 

Serves 6. Preparation 45 minutes. Time to cook 15 minutes. 
Economical. 

1 can of com 2 teaspoonfuls baking powder 

2 eggs 1 teaspoon ful of salt 

1 cupful of flour >i teaspoonful of pepper 

Put the com through a food chopper; add the well- 
beaten eggs, flour, seasoning and baking powder. Mix 
well and fry on a well-greased hot griddle or in deep fat. 

BEATEN BISCUIT 

Serves 4. Preparation 1 hour. Economical. 

2 cups flour 2 tablespoons lard 
1 cup milk or water % teaspoonful salt 

Stir the flour and add the salt, mixing thoroughly; 
then add the lard, and blend by rubbing through the hands 
till not a lump remains in the flour. Now add gradually 
the water or milk, or the milk and water combined, using 
half and half of each, and knead all together till the 
dough, which must not be too soft, but rather stiff, is 
formed. Then lay the dough on a biscuit board on a block, 
and beat for a half hour with a rolling pin. Knead lightly, 
and beat again for a full ten minutes, till from every por- 
tion of the surface and sides the air bubbles or "blisters" 
form. A special biscuit beater simplifies this process. 
Roll to quarter of an inch thick and cut round with round 
cutter, or square with a knife, and stick here and there with 
a fork. Bake in a moderate oven for about ten or fifteen 
minutes, till a delicate brown above and below. 

SOUTHERN EGG BREAD 

Serves 5. Preparation 25 minutes. Economical. 

1 quart commeal 1 cup of milk ( buttermilk if possible) 

2 eggs 1 teaspoonful of salt 2 tablespoonfuls of butter 
Scald the cornmeal with boiling water, add butter, and 

stir. Beat the yolks of the eggs very, very light. Add 
the cornmeal and melted butter and the salt, and beat until 
very light, moistening with the milk. Then add the whites 
of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Beat all well together. 
Pour into shallow tins and bake quickly. This is the real 
Creole corn bread, so highly praised by all tourists through 
Louisiana. The secret of the exquisite flavor depends 
upon the proper beating of the eggs, as well as on the rising 
of the com bread itself. If the eggs are well beaten, the com 
bread will need neither soda nor baking powder to make 
it rise properly. Some add a tablespoonful of sugar when 
they wish to have sweetened corn bread. Com bread, to 
be delicious, should always be served hot and generously 
buttered.

THE POPULAR SANDWICH 



The sandwich plays such an 
important part in the diet that its 
food value from the standpoint 
of balanced ratiim is of interest. A sandwich, being com- 
posed of slices of bread filled with meat or fruit and salad 
dressing, constitutes a meal when coupled with a beverage. 
All food principles are present and in the right proportions. 
A sandwich embodies protein, carbohydrate, mineral mat- 
ter and fat. 

Bread for sandwiches should be twenty-four hours old. 
Remove all outside crusts or not. as desired, before slicing. 
Slice very thin, for sandwiches should be dainty. Always 
cream the butter. It not only goes farther, but spreads 
more easily. 

Cold sliced meats form dainty sandwiches of fine flavor. 
Chopped pickles, olives, capers or other adjuncts improve 
meat sandwiches by adding a tart, spicy flavor. 

Butter is often mixed with creamed cheese, chopped 
anchovies, or other material of like nature, to form sand- 
wich pastes for filling. An ordinary sized loaf of sandwich 
bread should make between two and three dozen dainty 
sandwiches. One-half pound of butter is allowed for 
spreading this number of sandwiches.

USE OF LEFT-OVERS 

Waste has no place in the substantial American home. 
The wise home manager uses every bit of wholesome edible 
product for food. She makes tasty dishes of all left-over 
foods. A bit of extract of beef adds just the flavor nec- 
essary to make many left-over meat and vegetable dishes 
favorites with the family. 

Left-over egg yolks are rich in fat and may be used 
with skimmed milk in making custards, pudding sauces, 
salad dressings, noodles and in soups or drinks. Left-over 
whites may be used to clear coffee, consomme or bouillon. 

Left-over bits of cheese are excellent as garnishes and 
as flavoring for soups and milk sauces; they not only add 
a great deal of fat, but some protein also. Cheese may be 
grated, added to white sauce and served on toast. This 
makes a fine, tasty luncheon dish.

FEEDING THE YOUNGER GENERATION 



The fundamental principle in child feeding is the 
gradual development of the digestive powers. 

A normal child fed upon his mother's milk doubles in 
weight in the first six months of his life, largely because his 
food is adapted to his needs. Never will he double his 
weight so rapidly again. 

Cow's milk is the safe staple throughout the second 
year. Milk is easily assimilated; its protein furnishes nitro- 
gen in the best form for muscle building, and its fat provides 
the valuable vitamines. The mineral salts, so necessary to 
bone formation, are also found in this valuable food. Great 
care must be exercised to maintain clean, pure milk. 

Eggs, cereals, orange juice, tomato juice, or other mild 
fruit juices (a few spoonfuls at a time), round out the diet. 

When the teeth are cut, stale bread or dry toast should 
be added to the diet, to train the child to masticate. 

When the children grow older they should be gradually 
given a variety in diet and, above all, trained to eat what is 
put before them without comment. Avoid monotony; chil- 
dren as well as adults enjoy change in the form in which 
food is served. 

A normal child three to four years old needs 1100-1400 




calories of food per day; at the age of five. 1435-1517 calories 
are required; at the age of six, 1530-1575 calories; and at 
seven, 1600-1700 calories, according to weight. 

Milk and eggs continue to supply the necessary pro- 
tein, even after green vegetables are introduced, and a plain, 
simple dessert may be served at the end of a meal. 

Each day's menus should contain some protective foods. 
Breakfast is an important meal for the school child 
and should be given early so the child is not hurried or 
worried by fear of being late. Many children do poor work 
in school because they are not sufficiently nourished, and 
frequently the meager breakfast is at fault. A regular meal 
schedule should now be established and strictly adhered 
to. Irregularity is a grave error in child feeding. 

Milk, to the extent of a quart a day, should be con- 
tinued up to the twelfth year. Evaporated milk contains 
all the food properties of fresh milk.

CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME 

Much waste of food is due to carelessness in handling after it is delivered in the home. Thus the benefits of the 
elaborate care exercised in bringing the food to the consumer are sometimes lost by the carelessness of the housewife. 



Few of us realize the patient care and ofttimes bur- 
densome labor incident to food production. The long 
hours of labor necessary to produce food in any form 
should give us a wholesome respect for it when it comes 
into our kitchen all ready to form a part of the family diet. 

In case of vegetable foods, the preparation of the soil, 
selection of seed, the planting, care while growing, har- 
vesting and perhaps threshing, all demand great care and 
much labor upon the part of the farmer and his family. 

The food product ready, it is put to one of two uses- 
fed to the live stock from which we obtain our milk, butter, 
cheese, meat and meat products, or it is sent to factories 
where by means of much more labor and care it is further 
prepared for our table. By canning, as in case of fruits 
and vegetables, by milling of grains, or, if the product is a 
meat animal, by the many complicated processes of packing, 
the food is prepared for transportation. 

Perishable foods must be cared for in cold storage and 

Select foods carefully and use them with respect 



transported in refrigerator cars, all of which occupies the 
time and energy of thousands of people. 

Next, the retailer adds his services, and the article 
which has cost so much in money and energy is finally de- 
livered in the home in good condition. 

It is the duty of the housewife to unpack and properly 
put away all foods as soon as they are delivered. 

Place butter, milk, oleomargarine, shortenings, and 
frying mediums, eggs, and meat, as well as other perishables, 
in appropriate receptacles and put them in the refriger- 
ator. Meat should be unwrapped, placed on a plate and 
set in the refrigerator, but never directly on ice. Fresh 
salad materials should be cleaned, wiped dry, and put in a 
salad bag, in a cool place. 

Place cereals, syrups, coffee, tea, spices, baking powder, 
salt, extracts and all canned foods upon the pantry shelf 
or in the convenient kitchen cabinet.

TO HELP THE HOSTESS 

To observe the rules given for maid service when without a maid, 
would be an unnecessary tax upon one's time and strength. The serv- 
ing can be done nicely if attention be paid to certain points. 
To avoid disturbance and frequent rising from the table, all foods which the temperature of the rooms will not affect should be placed 
upon the table or the serving table. 

It is a good plan to have some young member of the family circle perform what service is required. For this kind of service it is per- 
missible to remove plates or dishes two at a time, one in each hand, and to leave a person without a plate. This is. of course, contrary to 
conventional service. 

A FEW STANDARD RULES FOR SERVING 

1. Pass and place everything from the left, except 
beverages and extra silver belonging on the right. 

2. Place and remove plates one at a time. To save 
time, two plates may be brought to the dining room. 
Place one on the serving table and the other on the din- 
ing table ; return to the serving table for the second plate, 
rather than to the pantry. 

3. Use a folded napkin in the hand under all dishes 
served which contain food. 

4. Use a tray only when passing or removing more 
than one article, as cream and sugar, or salt and pepper. 

5. In removing a course, first take all dishes contain- 
ing food, then soiled plates and silver. 

6. Special watchfulness should be given by the maid 
that each person's needs are attended to. 

7. Two pieces of silver placed on a platter containing 
food to be served are more convenient than one, for the 
person serving himself. 

8. No sound of preparation should come from the 
pantry. 

9. Hot dishes must come to the table hot and served 
on hot plates. Cold dishes must be cold and served on 
cold plates. 

10. A maid should always wear a clean fresh dress 
and apron. 

PREPAREDNESS MAKES DOING EASY 

The great majority of the American housewives do 
their own work. 

A bit of hourly help now and then is the extent of help 
in thousands of representative homes. 

To be able to prepare a perfect meal, have the house in 
order, the children happy and spotless, the table attractively 
set, and to serve the meal oneself at the same time retain- 
ing one's poise, occupying the hostess' place at the table, 
directing the conversation and creating a feeling of true 
hospitality is, perhaps, the greatest test of one's generalship. 

These suggestions will help make the accomplishments 
a pleasure. 



The "Day Before" 

1. Plan menu and do all buying excepting fresh salad 
materials. 

2. Prepare as much as possible of the company meal. 

3. Put the house in order. 

4. See that all silver, china, glassware and linen is in 
perfect condition. 

The "Day Of" 

1. Set the children at an interesting game early in 
the day where they will be free to romp. They will then 
want a rest at your busy time. 

2. Think what a joy these guests are to be and how 
happy you want to make everyone. 

3. Do necessary finishing touches, arranging decora- 
tions, and rest ten minutes, enjoying your anticipated pleas- 
ure before beginning the actual preparation of the meal. 

4. Manage a rest period of twenty minutes before 
dressing for dinner, and call to mind a few amusing inci- 
dents to relate. 

The ideal hostess is never tired or worried and has a 
fund of interesting conversation. 

THE THREE FORMS OF TABLE SERVICE 

1 The Russian Service is most formal. No food is 
on the table except candy and nuts. All serving is done 
from the pantry or the serving table. The food is attrac- 
tively arranged upon suitable dishes from which each 
person helps himself ; or portions may be arranged upon 
plates, one of which is placed before each person. The 
former method is preferable. 

2. The English Service is informal. The food is 
placed upon the table and served by those seated at the 
head and the foot. If one has a maid, the passing is done 
by her; if not, by those sitting at the table. 

3. The Mixed Service is a combination of the two 
mentioned and requires the service of a waitress. Some 
of the courses are served "from the side" (Russian), and 
some "from the table" (English). Frequently the meat is 
served from the table and the accompanying vegetables 
served from the side (Russian). 



Manage your buying so thai your guests may enjoy your company as well as your feasts

FOOD VALUES 




The body needs food to keep it warm, to furnish en- 
ergy for the activities of daily life; to build and repair 
tissue and to regulate the body process. 

Proteins, fats, carbohydrates, mineral matter, and 
water, are the chief classes of food. The chief work of 
proteins is to build and repair tissue. Meat and milk are 
the principal sources of protein. Nuts, vegetables and 
some cereals also supply this element. 

Carbohydrates are the starches and sugars. They are 
found in vegetables, cereals, and fruits and give heat and 
energy to the body. Fats give two and a half times as 
much energy as any other food. 

Mineral matters enter into the composition of the body 
tissues and blood. They act as regulators, preserving the 
alkalinity of the body. They are found in varying propor- 
tions in all foods, but milk contains all the essential ones. 

Vitamines are necessary for growth and are abundant 
in leafy vegetables and milk. Foods rich in vitamine 
content are known as protective foods. They prevent 
the development of deficiency and old age diseases. 

Water is necessary as a carrier and regulator. It aids di- 
gestion, removes waste, and keeps the temperature normal. 



Balanced Rations 

A general balance of food should be maintained in each 
day's diet : l/5th meat or meat alternatives, l/5th fat, and 
3/5ths carbohydrates, with a serving of fruits and vegetables 
and plenty of liquid, completes the necessary variety. 
WHERE THE CALORIE COMES IN 

Before assimilation, the food weeat must be oxidized or 
burned. The heat resulting from this oxidation is measured 
in terms of calories, or heat units. 

While the number of calories supplied by the diet is im- 
portant, the proper balance as to the classification of the food 
is of prime importance. We cannot build up the diet on calorie 
values alone without consideration of the food elements.

PROTECTIVE FOODS 



The responsibility for the correct development of a 
family rests more and more surely at the door of the one 
who plans and cooks the meals for that family. 

Nutrition experts are continually making careful tests 
and giving us valuable information through the news- 
papers and women's national publications. With such easy 
access to the fundamentals of correct eating, it comes close 
to criminal negligence for a mother to feed her family im- 
properly the present percentage of under-nourished child- 
ren is appalling, and many of these are in the homes of the 
well-to-do. 

The most important "food finding "of the year has been 
the information given the public 
regarding Protective Foods, some- 
times called dietetic ferments or the 
foods rich in the vitamines that pro- 
mote growth and those rich in the 
vitamines that protect one from de- 
ficiency diseases such as scurvy, 
beriberi, pellagra and less dangerous 
skin diseases. 

Milk and its products, butter and 

Armour's Veribest Evaporated Milk is a staple for the completely appointed pantry shelf 



cheese, are foremost growth promoters. In this class comes 
also the yolk of eggs, glandular meats, and grains with the 
living germ still intact. Leafy vegetables, such as spinach, 
lettuce, cabbage, chard, cauliflower, kale, all greens, water 
cress, onions, string beans, and a few others are classed with 
protective foods. 

While Professor McCuUom does not yet definitely list 
the tomato under protective foods, it is found to have val- 
uable protective qualities, often being substituted for orange 
juice in preventing scurvy in baby feeding. The protective 
substance of the tomato is not easily destroyed. 

Experiments are continually being completed which 
add new foods to this important group.

TIME AND TEMPERATURE 
It will not be long before thermometers will be gener- 
ally used as kitchen appliances. Until then we must show 
how we may know when a food is cooked, instead of stat- 
ing the exact number of minutes required. It is better in 
most cases to subject foods to a moderate heat for a long 
time, than to intense heat for a shorter period. The shape 
and size of the article to be cooked and the variety and 
age of fruit or vegetables must be considered.
