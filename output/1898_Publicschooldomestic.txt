*' I h.ave come to the conclusion thr.u more than half the disease 
which embitters the latter half of life ia due to jivoidablo errors in 
diet, and that more mischief in the form of actual disease, of 
impaired vigour, and of shortened life, accrues to civilized man in 
England and throughout Central Europe from erroneous habits of 
eating than fr<jm the habitual use of alcoholic drink, considerable 
as I know that evil to be." — Sir Henry Thomp.'ion. 



"Knowledge which subserves self-preservation by preventing 
loss of health is of primary importance. Wo do not contend that 
possession of such knowledge would by any means wiiolly remedy 
the evil. But we do ccmtend that the right knowledge imj)ressed 
in the right way would effect much ; and we furtlier contend that 
as the laws of health must be recognized before they can be fully 
conformed to, the imparting of sjich knowledge nmst precede a 
more rational living." — Herbert Spencer, 



"Cooking means the knowledge of Medtja and Circe, and of 
Calypso and Helen, and of Rebekah, and of the Queen of Sheba. 
It means the knowledge of all fruits, and herbs, and balms, and 
spices, and of all that is healing and sweet in fields and groves, 
and savory in meats ; it means carefulness, and inventiveness, 
and watchfulness, and willingness, and readiness of appliance ; it 
means nmch tasting and no wasting ; it means Knglisli thorough-

that you are to be perfect and always 'ladies' — 'loaf-givers.'"

PREFACE. 



J* 



AN eminent authority* says : " I'p to tlie age of sixteen 
even a lucid statement of principles is received by all 
but a few pupils as dogma. They do not and cannot in any 
adequate sense realize the reasoning process by which scientific 
conclusions are reached. They are taught not only facts but 
classificati(ins and laws, and causes in relaticm to their effect. 
These are not, in the majority of cases, elaborated by the 
pupil. The teaching of them accordingly degcMiei-ates into a 
statement of facts, and the learning of them into an act of 
memory." 

To obviate this condition, or to at least neutralize its 
effects somewhat, is one of the principal reasons for intro- 
ducing r)<miestic Science into the Public School curriculum ; a 
science which relates so closely to the daily life that it cannot 
be left to an act of memory ; where cause and effect are so 
palpable that the pupil may readily arrive at an individual 
conclusion. 

The aim of this text-book is to assist the pupil in acquiring 
a knowledge of the fundamental principles of correct living, to 
co-ordinate the regular school studies so as to make a i)ractical 
knowledge already acuuired. Arithmetic nhivs an

important part in tho arranging of weights and measures, in 
the study of tho analysis and relative value of various kinds 
of food, in estimating the cost of manufactured products in 
proportion to their market value, in tiie purchase of food 
material, etc. History and geogiaphy are closely allied to the 
study of the (Het and customs of the diil'erent countries, with 
their variety of climate and ]»ioducts. Physiology and tem- 
perance principles permeate the whole course ( '. study. In 
addition to these are the direct lessons, provided by the 
practice work, in neatness, promptness and ch^anliness. It 
will therefore be necessary to have a wide general knowledge 
before entering upon a course in Domestic Science. 

Owing to the limited time allowed for this course in the 
Public Schools, it will be impossil)le to teach more than a few 
of the first principles governing each department of the work, 
viz., a knowledge of the constituent parts of the human body ; 
the classification of food and the relation of each class to the 
sustenance and repair of the body ; simple recii)es illustrating 
the most whoh^some and economical methods of preparing the 
various kinds of food ; the science of nutrition, economy and 
hygiene ; general hints on household management, laundry 
work, and care of the sick. 

To enter more fully into the chemistry of food, bacteriology, 
etc, would tend to cause confusion in the mind of the aver- 
age school girl, and possibly create a distaste for knowledge 
containing so much abstract matter. 

This book is not a teacher's manual, nor is it intended to 
take the place of the teacher in any way. The normal training 
prescribed for teachers will enable them to supplement the 
information contained herein, by a much more general and com- 
prehensive treatment of the various questions, than would be 
possible or judicious in a primary text-book. It has been found 
difficult for pupils to copy the recipes given M'ith each lesson,

order to moot this (htlicuUy, also to onahlo tho pupil to work 
at home under the same rules whicli govern tho class work, 
simple recipes are given, heginning with a class requiring a

After tho pupils liave ac<piired a knowledge of tho " wiiy and

will have little ditUculty in following the more elaborate 
recipes given in the numberless co(>k-])ooks provided for house- 
hold use. Once the art — and it is a fino art — of cookery is 
mastered, it Ix'comes not only a pleasant occupation but 
provides excellent mental exercise, thereby preventing the 
reaction which fi-ecjuently follows school life. 

The tables gi\on are to be used for reference, and not to be 
memorized by the pupil. 

The writer is greatly indebted to Prof. Atwater for his 
kindly interest and assistance in providing nmch valuable 
inforuiation, which in some instances is given verbatim ; also 
to Dr. Oilman Thompson for permission to give extracts 
from his valuable book, "Practical Dietetics"; to Prof. 
Kinno, Columbia University (Domestic Science Dept.), for

School of Domestic Science, for practical hints and schedule 
for school work. The Boston Cook Book (with Normal 
Instruction), by Mrs, M. J. Lincoln ; and the Chemistiy of

Owinj; t(» tlie limitations of .-i text-hook, it will bu nucossjiry for 
the tcjicher to enter very cjirefully into Jill the details of the various 
(liiestions ; to exi)lain the uiulorlyiii"^ principles so thoroughly 
that " the why and the wherefore" of every action in the prepar- 
ation of food will lie clearly understood. She should endeavor to 
impress upon the pupils the value of thoroughly understanding the 
relation of food to the body. In practice lessons fre(pient reference 
should be made to tiie analysis of the various fonds, as given in the 
tables and charts. 

The first practice lesson should be given on the making and care 
of a fire, regulating dampers, cleaning stove, etc. The pupils 
should then be taught the name and place of all the utensils. 
Special attention should })e given to the explanation of weights and 
measures ; the table of abbreviations should be memorized. Ar- 
range the class work so that each pupil may in alternation share the 
duties of both kitchen work and cooking. 

Personal cleanliness nuist be insisted \\\un\. Special attention 
should be given to the hands and nails. The hair should be care- 
fully pinned back or confined in some way, and covered by a cap. 
A large clean apron and a holder should be worn while at work. 
Never allow the pupils to use a handkerchief or their aprons in 
place of a holder. Untidy habits must not be allowed in the class- 
room. Set an example of perfect order and neatness, and insist 
upon pupils following that example. Teach the pupils that cooking 
may be done without soiling either hands or clothes. The pupils 

shoidd do all the work of the class-room, except scrubbing the

floor. Kverythin;^ must bo loft; in porfoct order fit the close of each 
lesson. 

Fro(iiU!nt reviews are ■.bsoliitoly necessary. I'rge the puijils to 
think for themselves, aiul not to rely upon the text-bonk. Wiiere 
j)upils are backward, or have not had previous })ractice in kitchen 
Work, jj;ive special attention to their manner of holding a knife or 
spoon in preparing articles for use, and in boating or stirring 
mixtures. Kncourage deftness and light handling of kitchen ware. 
Insist iipon promptness and keeping within the time limit, both in 
preparing the food and in the cooking. 

Owing to the variety of climate and markets, it would be impos- 
sible to arrange the lessons in the text-book in regular order. A 
few sample menus are given at the back of the ])ook, but each 
teaclier must be governed by circumstances in arranging the lessons 
for her class. For instance, recipes without eggs should be given 
in mid-winter, when eggs are dear. Fruits and vegetables must be 
given in season. 

The recipes given in the text-book are suitable for class work ; in 
some cases it may be necessary to divide them, as the quantities 
given are intended for home practice. The teacher should con.sider 
herself at liberty to substitute any recii)e which slie may consider 
valuable. The digestibility of food, the etiect of stimulants — 
especially of tea and coffee, the value of fresh air, etc., should be 
carefully impressed upon the pu})il. 

The teacher must keep the object of this instruction con.stantly 
before her : (I) to co-ordinate other school studies, such as arith- 
metic, history, geography, physiology and temperance ; (*J) to 
develop the mental in conjunction with tlie manual powers of the 
children; (.S) to enable pupils to understand the reason for doing 
certain things in a certain way ; in other words, to work with an

intelligent C(»ncci)ti»>n of the value, both physically and hyj^ienically, 
of knowing how the daily duties should he performed. 

In order rhat material may not be needlessly destroyed, each 
class of food should bo introduced by an experimental lesscni. For 
instance, liefore giving a lesson in the preparation of starches, each 
pupil should be given an opportunity to learn how to mix and stir 
the mixture over the fire, so as to prevent it from ]»urning or 
becoming lumpy ; this may be done by using water and common 
laundry starch, or Hour. The same test ai)plies to sauces, etc. A 
few chea}) a})ples and potatoes may ])e used in learning to pare 
these articles. The effect of cold and hot water on albumen and 
tissues may be illustrated l)y tlie cheaper pieces of meat. 

Although the more scientific studies are grotiped together, it 
does not follow that they are to be studied in the order given. 
The teacher must arrange her lessons— from the beginning — so as 
to include a certain amount of the theory with the practice work. 
Fre(iuent reference should be m.-ule during practice lessons to the 
various chapters bearing more directly upon the science of cooking, 
so as to interest the pupil in the theoretical study of the food 
(question. 

The teacher should insist ufxm the pupils taking careful notes 
while she is demonstrating a lesson, so that they may not be 
entirely dependent upon the text-book, which from its limitations 
nmst simi)ly serve as the key-note for further study. 

Si)ecial attention must be given to the chapter on "Digestion," 
page 58, in the Puljlic School Physiology. Tliis chapter should be 
studied — especially jiages 71-75 — in conjunction with "Food 
Classifications " (Chap. 2) ; also in dealing with the digestibility of 
starches, etc.

CHAPTER I. 
The Relation of Pood to the Body. 

\n order to niKlcr.staiid tlie relation of food to the 
sustenance and iv])airin^ of the hody, it ^vill be neces- 
sary to learn, first, of what the body is composed, and 
the corresponding- elements contained in the food recjuired 
to buihl and keej3 tlie body in a liealthy condition. Tlie 
followino- table gives the approximate analysis of a man 
weighing 148 pounds: — 

Oxygen 92. 1 pounds. 

Hydrogen 14.6 n 

Carbon 31.6 t, 

Nitrogen 4.<5 n 

Pho.sphorus 1.4 n 

Calcium 2.8 

Suli)hur 0.24 

Cldorine 0.12 

Sodium 0. 1*2 « 

Iron 0.02 

Potassium 0. 34 r 

Magnesium 0.04 « 

Silica ? „ 

Fluorine 0. 02 i. 

Total . 148.00 pounds. 

As food contains all tliese elements, and as there is con- 
stant wearing and repair going on in the body, it will be 
readily seen how necessary some knowlerlge of the rela- 
tion of food to the body is, in order to preserve health.

Hydrogen uiid oxyn^en combined form water, hence we 
find from tlie Jibovc calcuhition that a])ont three-tiftlis of 
tlie body is com[)Osed of water. Cai'bon is a solid: 
diamonds are neai-ly pur(3 carbon ; "lead" of lead pencils, 
antln-acite coal and coke ai'e imj)ure forms of carbon. 
Carbon combined with other elements in the body 
makes aljout one-fifth of the whole weiirlit. Carbon 
with oxygen will ])nrn. In this way tlie carbon taken 
into th(i body as food, when combined with the oxygen 
of the inhaled air, yields heat to keep the body wann, 
and foi'ce — muscular strenii;th — for work. The carbonic 
acid (or carbon dioxide) is given out through the lungs 
and skin. In the further study of carbonaceous foods, 
their relation to the body as fuel will be more clearly 
und(3i-stood,as carbon is the most important fuel ehnnent. 
Phosphoi-us is a solid. According to the table, about one 
pound six ounces would be found in a body weighing 
148 pounds. United with oxygen, phosphoinis forms 
what is known as phosphoric acid; this, with lime, makes 
phosphate of lime, in which fcji'm it is found in the bones 
and teeth; it is found also in the brain and neives, flesh 
and blood. Hydi'ogen is a gas, and like carbon unites 
with the oxygen of the inhaled air in the body, thus 
serving as fuel. The water produced is given oflf in 
the respiration through the lungs and as perspiration 
throuixh the skin.* Calcium is a metal. The table o:iven 
allows three pounds of calcium ; united with oxygen, 
calcium forms lime. This with phosphoric acid mak(!S 
phosphate of lime, the basis of the bones and teeth, in 
which nearly all the calcium of the body is found.

The elements which bear no direct relation to the 
force production of the body, but whicli enter into tissue 
formation, are chlorine, sulphur, iron, so<lium, potassium, 
phosphorus, calcium and ma«,niesium. l^one tissue con- 
tains about 50 per cent, of lime phosphate, hence the 
need of this substance in tlie food of a (,n-o\vin<^f infant, 
in order that the bones may become firm and stroti*^. 
Lack of iron salts in the food impoverishes the colorin<r 
matter of the red blood corpuscles on which they dej)end 
for tlieir powi^r of canyin*^ oxy<^en to the tissues; 
an.nomia and other disorders of deficient oxidation result. 
The lack of suflieient potasli salts is a factor in producinjj^ 
scurvy, a condition a<r<^ravated by the use of connnon 
salt. A diet of salt meat and starches may cause it, with 
absence of fi'esh fVuit and vej^e tables. Such illustrations 
show the need of a well-balanced diet. 

In order to understand the value of the various classes 
of food and their ndation to the body as force producers, 
tissue builders, etc., the foUowin*^ table may prove 
helpful : —

with tho science of this question, as it ndates to the daily 
life, should be to learn something of how food Ijuilds the 
body, rejjairs the waste, yields heat and eneroy, and to 
teach the principles of food economy in its relation to 
health and income. This, with the development of ex- 
ecutive ability, is all that can be attempted in a jn-imary 
course.

"Nitrogenous extractives" of llesh, i.p., of meats and fish. 
These include kreatiu and allied compounds, and are the 
chief ingredients of beef tea and most meat extracts. 
Amids: this term is frequently applied to the nitrogenous 
non-albuminoid compounds of vegetable foods and feeding 
stull's, among which are amido acids, such aa aspartic acid 
and asparagin. Some (»f them are more or less allied in 
chemical constitutiou to the nitrogenous extractives of

to the carbonaceous ^roup. 

Therefore, for practical pur[)osrs, \V(^ will confine our- 
selves to th(! mort! «^'eneral terms used in Atwater's tabh?. 

Uses of Pood. 

First, food is used to foi-m the materials of the l)ody 
and repair its waste; second, to yield enei'<4y ^'^ ^^"' form 
of (1) heat to kee]) the Ijody warm, (2) to provide mus- 
cular and other power for tlai work it has to do. In 
forminLj'the tissues and iluids of the bodv tlu; food serves 
for buildini'' and repair. In vieldinii' enert'-v, it ser\-es as 
fuel for lu'at and power. The principal tissue formers 
are the albuminoids; these form the fi'ame-work of the 
body. They l)uild and repair the nitro^a-nous materials, 
as those of nniscle, tendon and bone, and HU[)ply the 
albuminoids of blood, milk and other Iluids, The chief 
fuel int^redients of food are tlu; carbohydrates and fats. 
These are either consumed in the })ody or are stored as 
fat to be used as occasion demands. 

Water. 

By referring to a preceding- chapter we find that water 
composes three-fifths of the entire body. The elasticity 
of muscles, cartilage, tendons, and even of bones is duo 
in great })art to the water wliich these tissues contain. 
The amount of water recjuired by a liealthy man in 
twenty-four hours (children in proportion) is on the

CHAPTER IV. 

Food and Economy. 

It has been stated that " a (piart of milk, three-quarters 

of a pound of moderately lean beef, and five ounces of 

wheat flour contain about the same amount of nutritive 

material ; " l)ut we pay different prices for them, and they 

have different values for nutriment. The milk comes 

neai'est to being a perfect food. It contains all the dif- 

fei'ent kinds of imtritive materials that the body requires. 

Bread made from wheat flour will support life. It 

contains all the necessary ingredients for nourishment, 

but n(jt in the proportion best adapted for ordinary use. 

A man might live on beef alone, but it would be a very 

one-sided and imperfect diet. IMeat and bread together 

make the essentials of a healthful diet. In order to give 

a general idea of food economy, it will be necessary to 

deal briefly with the functions of the various food 

principles. As our bodies contain a great deal of muscle, 

the waste of which is repaired by protein found in such 

food as lean meat, eggs, cheese, beans, peas, oatmeal, flsh, 

etc., a sup2)ly of these articles nnist be considei'ed in 

purchasing the daily supply. Fatty tissue (not muscle) 

serves as fuel, therefore the value of such foods as butter, 

cream, oils, etc., is apparent. Carbohydrates form fat and 

serve as fuel and force producers; these come in the form 

of starches, sugars, — vegetables and grains ])eing the most 

important. "In being themselves burned to yield energy, 

the nutrients protect each otlier from being consumed. 

Tlie protein and fats of body tissue are used like those

of foods. An important use of thc^ carhohy«lrates and 
fats is to protect protein (muscle, etc.) from consumption. 
" The most healthful food is that whicli is best fitted to 
the wants of the user : tlie clieapest food is that whicli 
furnishes the largest amount of nutriment at the least 
cost : the best food is tliat wliich is both healthful an<l 
cheap." By refen-ing to the various charts a fair 
estimate of food values may be obtained. 

As will be noticed, the animal foods contain the most 
protein and fats, while the vegetable foods are rich in 
carbohydrates. A pound of cheese may have 0.2S 
pound of protein, as much as a man at ordinary work 
needs for a day's sustenance, while .a 2)ound of milk 
would have only 0.04, and a pound of potatoes 0.02 
pound of protein. The materials whicli have the most 
fats and carbohydrates have the highest fuel value. 
The fuel value of a pound of fat pork may reach 2.995 
calories, while that of a pound of salt codfish would be 
only .315 calories. On the other hand, the nutritive 
material of the codfish would consist almost entirely of 
protein, while the pork contains very little. Among the 
vegetable foods, peas and beans have a high ])roporti()n 
of protein. Oatmeal contains a large proportion also. 
Potatoes are low in fuel value as well as in protein, 
because they are three-fourths water. For the same 
reason milk, wliich is seven-eights water, ranks low in 
respect to both protein and fuel value, hence the reason 
why it is not so valuable as food for an adult as many 
of the other food materials. 

These few illustrations will help to show the need of 
an intelligent idea of food values before attempting to 
purchase the supplies for family use. As one-half a

Quantity of Food Required. 

The quantity of food recpiired to maintain the body in 
a vigorous condition de2)ends upon the following condi- 
tions : — (1) Climate and season, (2) clothing, (8) occupa- 
tion, (4) age and sex. In civilized countries more food is 
eaten, as a rule, than is necessary to maintain health and 
strength. Climate and seasons influence the quantity of 
food eaten. A cold, bracing atmosphere stinnilates the 
appetite, tempts one to exercise, while a hot climate has 
the contraiy effect ; hence the need for more or less food. 
Abundant clothing in cold weather conserves the body 
heat ; less food is therefore re(iuired to maintain life. 
Exercise and muscular work cause greater oxidation in 
the tissues and greater waste of thenuiscles; this nmst 
be replaced by proper food. Outdoor work requires 
more food than indoor, and physical labor more than

Just what ini:re(hents of the food serve for nourisli- 
ment of the ])rain and nerves, and liow they do that 
sei'viee, are mysteries which have not yet been solve<l. 
Brain and nerv(^ contain the elements nitrojjfon and 
plios])horus, which aiH^ found in protein compounds but 
not in th«i ti'Uc; fats, sugars, and starches, which contain 
only carbon, hy(h'0<4en and oxy<^en. We naturally infer 
that the protein compounds must be especially concerned 
in building up brain and nerve, and keepinti^ them in 
I'epair. Just liow nnicli food the biain worker needs is 
a (|Uestion which lias not yet ])een decided. In o^eneral it 
aj)pears that a man or a woman whose occupation is 
what we call sedentary, who is without vijxorous exercise 
and does but little hard nuiscular work, needs much less 
than the man at liard manual labor, and that the brain 
worker needs comparatively little of carbohydrates or 
fats. JMany physicians, physiologists and students of 
h^'giene have become convinced that Avell-to-do people, 
whose work is mental rather than physical, eat too much; 
tliat the diet of people of this chiss as a whole is one- 
sided as well as excessive, and that the principal evil is 
the use of too nmch fat, starch and suoar. It is well to 
remendjiir that it is tlie qujintity of food digested which 
builds the body, and more injury is likely to result from 
over-eating than from a restricted diet, lience the value

Quality of Food. 

It is a great mistake to think tliat the best is the 
cheapest in regard to the food question, that the higher 
priced meats, fish, butter, etc., contain special virtues 
lacking in the clieaper articles. Poor cooking is the chief 
cause of this error in jvdgment. No doubt a well broiled 
steak is more appetizing and delicate in flavor than some 
of the cheaper cuts, but in proportion to the cost is not 
e(|ual in nutritive value ; careful cooking and judicious 
flavoring render the cheaper pieces of beef equally palat- 
able. That expensive food is not necessary to maintain 
life has been clearly demonstrated by the traditional diet 
of the Scotch people w^ith their oatmeal and lierring ; the 
Irish, j)otatoes and buttermilk; New England, codfish and 
potatoes, and pork and beans ; the Chinese, rice, etc. Mo- 
notony of diet, however, is not recommended, for reasons

{ic(juired this knowle'dge she will have covered the ti«*ld 
of food economy. Prof. Atwater says : "When we know 
what are the kinds and amount of nutritive substances 
our bodies need and our food materials contain, then and 
not till then shall wt^ be able to adjust our diet to the 
demands of health and purse." 

Cooking of Food. 

It is sometimes asked, whv do we cook our food ? As 
many opportunities will occur during this course of in- 
struction for a comparison of the customs and diet of 
the various countries, and the advance of civilization in 
this direction, we will contine ourselves to tlu^ deflidtion 
of the term as it concerns ourselves. 

Mr. Atkinson says, that "Cooking is the right aj)pli- 
cation of heat for the conversion of food material." 

As much of our food recjuires cooking, lunv W(; shall 
cook it so as to render it more palatable, more digesti])l(', 
and with the greatest economy of time, fuel and money,

notony of di(^t and of flavor lessens the appetite and 
fails to stinnilate the digestive or^iuns. 

The chemical changes, produced by cooking- food j)ro- 
perly, aid dio-ostion, beside destroyiiii^ any e(.|-i,,s ^vhich 
may be contained in the food. Nearly all foods — exce])t 
fruit — require cookin^-. The digest ibi lily of staieh de- 
pends almost entirely upon the manner in Avhich it is 
cooked, especially the cereal class. Gastric troubles ai'e 
sure to follow the use of improperly cooked grains or 
starches. (See Chap. VI I.) 

Methods. 

The following are the usual methods observed 
in cooking, viz.: (1) boiling, (2) stewing, (Ji) 
i-oasting, (4) broiling, (5) frying, (6) braising, (7) 
baking, (8) steaming. 

Water boils at a temperature of 212° F. 
Sinnnering should be at a temperature of from 
175'' F. to 180 F. When water has reached the 
boiling j)oint, its temperature cannot be raised, 
but will be converted into steam; hence the folly 
of adding fuel to the tire when water has already 
reached the boiling point. 

Stewing allows the juices of the meat to 
become dissolved in water heated to the simmer-

with the meat. If not injured by the addition 
of rieh sauces or fats, tliis is usually a very 
di<^estible method of pi'e[)arin»( certain kinds of 
nu'at. 

]^>roilin(jf is cooking directly over the liot coals, bikhlinu. 
A coatint; of coa^ailated albumen is fcjrmed ui)on 
the outer surface. This C(^atin<( prevents the 
evaporation of the juices, ^vhich with the extrac- 
tive materials are retaitied and improve the 
Havor. Meat cooked in this way has a decided 
advantaire, in both flavor and nutritive value, 
over that which has been boiled or stewed. 
There are, however, only certain kinds of meat 
that are suitable for broiling. 

Fryin<^ is cookin<ij in liot fat. The boiling fryino. 
point of fat is far above that of water. Fat 
should not be heated above 400^ F., as it will 
then turn dark and emit a disai^reeable odor. 
Fried i'oo<l, unless very carefully prepared, is con- 
sidered unwholesome. The only proper method 
for frying is to immerse the food completely in a 
bath of liot fat. 

Braisini; is cookinir meat in a covere*! vessel braising. 
surrounded by a solution of vegetable and animal 
juices in a strong but not boiling temperature. 
Tough meat may be rendered veiy palatable and 
nutritious by cooking in this way. The cover of 
the pan or kettle must fit closely enough to pre- 
vent evaporation. It requires long, steady cook- 
ing. The flavor is improved by browning the

Food Preservation. 

Food is preserved by the followinu^ processes : 
(1) drying, (2) smoking, (8) salting, (4) fi-ee/ing, 
(5) refrigerating, (6) sealing, (7) addition of anti- 
septic and preservative substances. 

Drying in the sun and before a fire is the 
usual method employed by liousekeepers. Fruits 
and vegetables, meat and lish may be preserved 
by drying, tlie latter with the addition of salt. 

Smoking is chiefly applied to beef, tongue, 
bacon, liam, and fish, which are hung in a con- 
fined chandler, saturated with wood smoke for a 
long time until they absorb a certain percentage 
of antiseptic material, which prevents the fat 
from becoming rancid, and the albumen from 
putrefying. Well smoked bacon cut thin and

s<'rvinir food. 'J'he addition of a little saltot'tre 
helps to preserve the color of the meat. Urine 
is fi-e(|uently used to temporai-ily preserve meat 
and other sul)stances. Corne<l berf is a popiilai' 
form of salt ])re.s('rvation. All salted meats re- 
(juire long, slow cooking. They should always 
be ])laced in cold Avater an«l heated gradnally in 
order to extract the salt. Salt meats are less 
digestible and not (piite so nutritious as fresh 
meats. 

Food may be kept in a frozen condition almost kkkkzimj. 
indefinitely, but will decompose very quickly 
when tliawed, hence the necessity for cooking 
innnediately. Frozen meat loses 10 per cent, of 
its nutritive value in cooking. 

This process does not involve actual freezing, ukfkickr- 
but implies preservation in chandlers at a tem-"^^'*"^*'' 
perature maintained a few degrees above fret'zing 
point. This method does not atlcct the flavor or 
nutritive value of food so much as freezino-. 

Sealing is accomplished not only in the process .skalinc;. 
of canning but by covering with substances 
which arc impermeable. Beef has been pre- 
served for considerable time by innnersing in 
hot fat in which it was allowed to remain after 
coolino;. 

Chemicals are sometimes used in the preserva- en kj^h- 
tion of food, but the other methods are safer.

CHAPTER V. 

Foods Containing Protein, or Nitrogrenoua 

Matter. 

Animal foods contain nutritive matter in a 
concentrated form, and being chemically similar 
to the composition of the body is doubtless the 
reason why they assimilate more readily than 
vegetable foods, although the latter are richer in 
mineral matter. The most valuable animal foods 
in connnon use are meat, eggs, milk, fish, gelatin 
and fats. 
MEAT. ]\Ieat is composed of muscular tissue, connec- 

tive tissue or gristle, fatty tissue, blood-vessels, 
nerves, bone, etc. The value of meat as food is 
due chiefly to the nitrogenous compound it con- 
tains, the most valuable being the albuminoids ; 
the gelatinoid of meat is easily changed into 
gelatin by the action of hot water. Gelatin 
when combined with the albuminoids and ex- 
tractives has considerable nutritive value. Ex- 
tractives are meat bases, or rather meat which 
has been dissolv^ed by water, such as soup stock 
and beef tea. The object in cooking meat is to 
soften and loosen the tissue, which renders it more 
easily digested. Another object is to sterilize or 
kill any germs which may exist and to make it 
more palatable. The digestibility of meat is 
influenced by the age of the animal killed and 
the feedinof. The followini; table is oiven as an 
average of the digestibility of animal foods : —

of the juices. If tlte meat alone is to be used it 
should be placed in sufficient boilint^ water to 
completely cov^er, and kept at boilin^^ point 
(212° F.) for at least ten minutes, so as to harden 
tlie albumen and prevent the escape of the juices. 
The temperature should then be allowed to fall 
to sinnnering point (175" F.). If the water is 
kept boiling it will render the meat tough and 
dry. If the juice is to be extracted and the 
broth used, the meat should be placed in cold 
water; it' bones are.fidded they should be cut or 
broken into small pieces in order that the gela- 
tin may be dissolved. If the water is heated 
gradually the soluble materials are more easily 
dissolved. The albumen will rise as a scum to 
the top, but should not be skinmied off, as it 
contains the moat nutriment and will settle to 
the bottom as sediment. 

If both meat and broth are to be used the 
process of cooking should be quite different. In 
stewing, the meat should be cut into small pieces, 
put into cold water in order that the juices, 
flavoring material and fibre may be dissolved. 
The temperature should be gradually raised to 
sinnnering point and remain at that heat for 
at least three or four hours, the vessel being kept 
closely covered. Cooked in this way the broth 
will be rich, and the meat tender and iuicy. Any 
suitable flavoring may be added. Tins is a good 
method for cooking meat containing gristle.

shrinka<re in a roast of meat during*; cookint; is 
chielly due to a loss of water. A small roast will 
iv([uire a hotter fire than a larger one, in order 
to harden the exterior and prevent the juices 
from escaping. Meat is a poor conductor of 
heat, conseipiently a large roast exposed to this 
intense heat would become bui'ncd before the 
interior could be heated. The large roast should 
l)e exposed to intense heat for a few minutes, but 
tlie temperature should then be reduced, and long 
steady cooking allowed.

contains too much fat to agree well with people 
of delicate digestion. 

Yeal, wdien obtained from animals killed too vkai. 
young, is apt to be tough, pale and indigestible, 
but good v^eal is considered fairly nutritious. It 
contains more gelatin than beef, and in broth is 
considered valuable, especially for the sick. 

]\Iutton is considered to be more digestible mitton. 
than beef, that is well fed nuitton from sheep 
at least three years old ; but as it is more ditli- 
cult to obtain tender mutton than beef, the latter 
is nujre generally preferred. Mutton broth is 
wholesome and valuable in sickness. 

Lamb, when tender and of the right age, is lamb. 
(juite as digestible as beef or njuttcm, but the 
iiesh contains too large a proportion of fat.

VENISON. Venison is a tender meat with sliort fibres, 
which is very dio-estible when obtained from 
young deer, but is considered to be rather too 
stinmlating. Its chemical composition is simiUir 
to lean beef. 

PORK. Pork is a tender-fibred meat, but is very indi- 

gestible owing to tlie liigh percentage of fat, 
which is considerably more than the nitrogenous 
viiaterial it contains. Pork ribs may liave as 
much as 42 per cent, of fat. 

Haiii is more digestible wlien well boiled and 
<';)ten cold. Bacon is more easily digested than 
I'itlKThamor pork; when cut thin and cooked 
I'll Iv'ly — -until transparent and crisj) — it can 
ofteii b<; eaten by dyspeptics, and forms an ex- 
•,"<'llent k:c>^ for consumptives. 

FOWL. Chick cix i- of.e of the most digestible of meats, 

contains considerable phosphorus and is particu- 
larly valuable as food for invalids. Turkey is 
somewhat less diirestible tlian cliicken. Ducks 
and geese are dilficult of digestion, unless (juite 
young, on account of the fat they contain. 

(lame, if well cooked, is fairly digestible. 

Sweetbread, which is thymus gland of the 
calf, is a delicate and agreeable article of diet, 
particularly for invalids. Tripe, heart, liver and 
ki«ln(^ys are other forms of animal viscera used 
as food — valuable chiefly as affording variety. 

Fisu. The chief difference in fish is the coarseness of 

fibre and the (piantity of fat present. Fish

[)ercenta<]je of albuminoids: — Red snapper, white- 
tisli, brook trout, salmon, bluefish, shad, eels, 
mackerel, halibut, haddock, lake trout, bass, cod 
and flounder. The old theory that fish consti- 
tuted "brain food," on account of the phosphorus 
it contained, has proved to be entirely without 
foundation, as in reality many fish contain less 
of this element than meat. The tribes which live 
lar^^ely on fish are not noted for intellectuality. 
Fish havint^ white meat when broiled or boiled — 
not fried — are excellent food for invalids or 
people of weak digestion. Fish should be well 
cooked. 

Oysters are a nutritious food, and may ])e<>YSTKus. 
eaten either raw or cooked. Lobsters, crabs aiid 
shrimps are called " sea scavent^ers," and unless 
absolutely fresh are not a desirable food. 

Milk contains all the elements which areMU.K. 
necessary to maintain life ; and constitutes a 
complete diet for infants. It will sustain life in 
an adult for several months. Althout^h milk 
furnishes a useful food, it is not essential to a 
diet required for active bodily exercise. It is 
seldom given to athletes while in active training. 
Adults who are able to eat any kind of food are 
kept in better health by abstaining from milk, 
except as used for cooking purposes. An occa- 
sional glass of hot milk taken as a stinnilant for 
tired brain and nerves is sometimes beneficial.

30 DOMESTIC SCIEXCE. 

Milk i.s composed of water, salts, fat, milk sn^ar 
or lactose, albumen and casein. Avera<^o milk 
has from 8 to 10 per ctnit. o^' cream. (Jood milk 
should form a layer of cream about 2^ in. thick 
as it stands in a quart bottle. Lactose (milk 
suo-ar) is an important in<^redient in milk. It is 
less liable to ferment in the stomach than cane 
sugar. In the presence of fermentinj^ nitrogen- 
ous material it is converted into lactic acid, 
making the milk sour. Casein is present in milk 
chielly in its alkaline form, and in conjunction 
with calcium phosphate. ]\Iilk absoi-bs germs 
from the air and from unclean vessels very 
readily. CJood, clean, uucontaminattMl milk 
ought to keep fresh, exposed in a clean room 
at a temperature of 68' F., for 48 hours without 
souring. If the milk is taintecl in any way it 
M'ill sour in a few hours. Boiled milk will keep 
fresh half as long again as fresh milk. Milk 
absorbs odors very quickly, therefore should 
never be left in a refrigerator with stale cheese, 
ham, vegetables, etc., unless in an air-tight jar. 
It should never be left exposed in a sick room 
or near waste pipes. Absolute cleanliness is 
necessary for the preservation of milk; vessels 
in which it is to be kept must be thoroughly 
scalded with boiling water, not merely washed 
out with warm waiter.

Gelatin is obtained from bones, ligaments, and 
other connective tissues. In combinations with 
other foods it has considerable nutritive value. 
The place given to it by scientists is to save the 
albumen of the body ; as it does not help to form 
tissue or repair waste it cannot replace albumen 
entirely. Gelatin will not sustain life, but when 
used in the form of soup stock, etc., is considered 
valuable as a stimulant.

The principal animal fats are butter, cream,

Carbohydrate Foods. 

Tlie idt'ji of starchy foods is usually connected 
with such substances as laundry starch, corn- 
starch, arrow root, etc. These are, of course, 
more concentrat('<l forms of starch than pota- 
toes, rice, etc. j\Iany starchy foods contain other 
in<;redients, and some are especially rich in 
proteids.

It is estimated that starch composes one-half 
of peas, beans, wheat, oats and rye, three-fourths 
of corn and rice, one-fifth of potatoes. Vegetable 
proteids, as already stated, are less easily dioest- 
ed than those belonjxiuir to the animal kiniidom, 
therefore it must be remeiidiered that a purely 
ve(retable diet, even though it niay be so ai'rang-

its own work to do, and the saliva acts 
directly upon the starchy food; hence the im- 
portance of thoroughly masticating such food as 
bread, potatoes, rice, centals, etc. The action of 
lieat, in baking, which causes the vapor to rise, 
an<l forms the crust of stai-chy food, produces 
what is called dextrine, or partially digested 
starch. Dextrine is soluble in cold water, hence 
the ease with which crust and toast — when 
properly made — are digested. It is moi'e im-

(Konig.) 

Grains. 

While the grains contain less proteid than the 
legumes, they are more valuable on account of 
the variety of the nutrients contained in them, 
and are more easily adapted to the demands of 
the appetite. They, however, re(piire long, slow 
cooking in order to soften the tiljre and render 
the starch more soluble. Among the most im- 
portant we may place ; 

A wheat kernel may be subdivided into three 
layers. The first or outer one contains the brjin ; 
second, the gluten, fats and salts; third, the starch. 
Some of the mineral matter for which wheat is 
so valuable is contained in the bran, hence the 
value of at least a portion of that part of the 
wheat being included in bread flour — not by 
the addition of coarse bran (which is indigest- 
ible) to the ordinary flour, but by the refining 
j)rocess employed in producing whole wheat 
flour. While wheat is used in other forms, its 
principal use as food is in the form of flour.

bread from wheat and maize, will be of interest

BREAD. 



I'lio most v}ilua))l(' food pi-oduct iiuinnfaetured 
from flour is bread. 

Bread contains so many of tlie in^n-edients re- 
quired to noui'isli tlie body, viz. : fat, pnjteid, 
salts, sugar an<l stareli, tliat it may well be 
termed the "slatKof life." As it does not con- 
tain enough fat for a perfect food the addition 
of butter to it rendei-s it moi-e valuable as an 
article of diet. Mrs. Ellen 11. Richards gives 
the following explanation of what constitutes 
ideal bread: "(1) It should retain as much as 
possible of the nutritive principles of the grain 
from which it is made; (2) it should be prepared 
in such a manner as to secure the complete 
assimilation of thes(^ nutritive principles; (3) 
it should be light and poi'ous, so as to allow the 
digestive juices to penetrate it (piickly and 
thoroughly; (4) it should ]»e nearly or quite free 
from coarse bi-an, which causes too rapid mus- 
cular action to allow of complete digestion. This 
etlect is also produced when the bread is sour." 
Bread is made from a combination of Hour, 
li(|uid (either milk or water), and a vegetable 
ferment called yeast (see yeast recipes). The 
yeast acts slowly or rapidl}' according to the 
tenqjeratiu'e to which it is exposed. The starch 
lias to be changed by the ferment called 
diastase (<liastase is a vegetable ferment which 
converts starchy foods into a soluble material 
called maltose) into sugar, and the sugar into 
alcohol and carbonic acid gas (carbon dioxide), 
when it makes itself known by the bubbles

may be no large holes and the fei-mentation be 
e(pial throughout. The loaf is baked in older to 
kill the ferment, to render the starch soluble, to 
expand the carbonic acid gas and drive off' the 
alcohol, to stiffen the gluten and to form a crust 
which sliall have a pleasant flavoi-. jMuch of the 
indigestibility of ])read is owing to the imperfect 
baking; unless the interior of the loaf lias reached 
the sterilizing point, 212 F., tin; bacteria con- 
tained in the yeast will not be killed, and some 
of the gas will remain in the centre of the l<jaf. 
The scientific method of l)akinir bread is to fix 
the air cells as quickly as possible at first. This 
can be done better by baking the bread in small 
loaves in se[)arat(i pans, thei-eby s<'curing a uni- 
form heat and more crust, which is considered to 
hi) th(! most e.'isily digested part of the bread. 
SoiiH! cooks consider that lonij, slow baking Dro- 
duces a more desirable llavor and renders bread 
more digestible. One hundred poun<ls of lloin- 
will make an average of one hundred and thirt v- 
hve pounds of bread. This increas" of weight is 
due to the addition of water.

Buckwheat is tlie least important of tlie 
cereals. 

Rye is almost C(]ual to wheat in initritivc 
value. Its treatment in rei^ard to bread makina" 
is similar to that of wheat. 

Corn contains fat, pi'oteid and starch, and 
produces heat and energy. It is very fattening, 
and when eaten as a vegetable is considered 
difficult of diixestion. Cornmeal is a whoh^some 
food ; it contains more fat than wheat flour, and 
less mineral matter. 

Rice constitutes a staple food of a great many 
of the world's inhabitants. It contains more 
starch than any other cereal, but when properly 
cooked is very easily digested. It should bi; 
combined with some animal food, as it contains 
too little nitrogen to satisfy the demands of the 
system. It forms a wholesome combination 
with fruit, such as apples, peaches, prunes, 
berries, etc. 

Barley is almost ecpial to wheat in nutritive 
value. It contains more fat, mineral matter and 
cellulose (cellulose is often called indigestible 
fibre, as it resists the solvent action of the

ible. Pea and bean soups are considered xt^i-y 
nutritious. Lentils grow in France; they an; 
dried and split, in wliich form tliey are used in 
soups. 

Potatoes are the most popular of all the tubfi-s. i-otatoks. 
As an article of diet they possess litth; nutritive;

contain some mineral matter, hence the reason 
why they are better boiled and baked in th<;ir

Beets contain between 85 and 90 per cent, of 
stareh and sugar, some salts, and a little over one 
per cent, of pnjteid matter. Y()nn<r beets, either 
in the form of a ve^^ctable or a sala<l, are con- 
sidered to be very wholesome. 

Carrots, turnips, parsnips and oyster plant, 
althoui]fhcontaininf»; a larffe perecntaue of water, 
are consider«'<l valuable as nutrients, the turnip 
])eincjf the least nutritious. 

Green vem'tables do not contain much initri- 
ment, and are chieily valuable as atloi'diucr a 
pleasincr variety in diet; also for supplyinii^ 
mineral matter and some acids. In this class 
we niay include cabbage, cauliflower, spinach, 
lettuce and celery. 

Tomatoes arc wliolesome vegetables ; on ac- 
count of the oxalic acid they contain they do not 
always agree with people of delicate digestion. 

Cucumbers are neither wholesome nor di- 
gestible. 

Asparagus is a nnich prized ^•egetable. The 
substance called asparagin which it contains is 
supposed to ])ossess some value. 

Rhubarb is a wholesome veiretable. 

Om'ons, gallic, an<l shallots are valuable both 
as condiments and eaten sepai'ately. They con- 
tain more nutrients than the last ve<^etables

Fruits. 



Fruits an; composed largely of wntd-, with 
starc'lics, a vt'g('(al)lo jelly, pectin, ccllulost; and 
organic acids. Tlie most important acids in frnit 
ai-o citric, malic and tarta?'ic. Citric acid is 
I'onnd in lemons, limes and oranires; tartaric 
acid in grapes ; malic acid in apples, pears, 
peaches, apricots, go()sel)en-ies ancl cnrrants. 
Among the least acid are peaches, sweet apples, 
bananas and prunes. Strawberries arc moder- 
ately acid, while lemons and currants contain 
the most acid of all. 

Uses of Fruit. 

(1) To furnish nutriment; (2) to convey water 
to the system and relieve thirst; (-S) to introduce 
various mineral matter (salts) and acids which 
improve the (piality of the blood ; (4) as anti- 
scorbutics ; (5) as laxatives and cathartics; 
(0) to stinnilate the appetitf^ impi-ove digestion 
and provide variety in the diet. Apples, lemons 
and oranges are especially valuable f(jr the jiot- 
ash salts, lime and magnesia they contain. 
Fruit as a connnon articU* of daily diet is hi<ddv 
beneficial, and should be used freely in season. 
Cooked fruit is more c 



IS more easily digested than raw, 
and when over-ripe should always be cooked in 
order to prevent fruit jjoisoning.

Beveragres. 

Tannin is an astrin«.,^cnt of vegetable origin 
which exists in tea, is also found in cott'ec and 
wines, and is very injurious. Tea i.S' a prepar- 
ation made from the leaves of a slirub called 
Thea. The ditference b(;tween ])lack and green 
tea is due t(3 the mode of preparation, and not to 
separate species of plant. Green tea contains 
more tannin than black. The following table

The .stimulating properties which tea pos.se.sses, 
as well as its color and flavor, depend upon 
the season of the year at which the leaves are 
gathered, the variety of the plant, the nge < 
leaves, which become tough as they ., 

and the care exercised in their ^ parai di. 
Much depends upon the manner in which k^a is

Coffee is frequently adulterated with chicory, 
which is harmless. Coti'ee should not be allowed 
to boil long or stand in the coti'ee pot over a tire, 
as the tannin is extracted, which renders it more 
inditrestible. Much controversy has been in- 
dulged in over the effect of coffee upon the 
system, but like many other similar (questions it 
has not reached a practical solution. The general 
opinion seems to be that when properly made 
and used in moderation it is a valuable stimulant 
and not harmful to adults. 

Cocoa and chocolate contain more food sub- cocoa. 
stances than tea or coffee, although their use in 
this respect is not of much value. The following

CundiiiHnits and spices are used as food ad-

beiniij mainly stimulatinL,^ and are very injurious 
when used in excess. Thev ad<' flavor to foo<l 
an<l relieve monotony of diet. 'J'he use of such 
condiments as pepper, curry, pickles, vinegar and 
mustard, if abused, is (h'cidedly liarmful. Salt 
is the only necessary condiujent, for reasons 
given in the chapter on mineral matter. The 
blondinu^ of flavors so as to mak»' food more 
palatable without bein;^ injured is one of the fiije 
arts in cookerv. Some flavors, such as leinon 
juice, vinc<^ar, etc., increase the solvent pi'opei'tics 
of the gastric juice, making certain foods iiuht 
diijestible.

how the vaiMous foods should ])e prepared, either 
hy cookini^ or in whatever foi'in circiniistaiiceH 
and the matei'ial niay iHMpiii'e. TW, first re(jui- 
site for e(Jokini^ pui'posi's is heat ; thisneeessitates 
the use of fuel. Tlu^ fuels ehiefly used for house- 
hold pui'poses are wood, eoal, kei-osene oil and 
jfixs. Soft woods, such as pine; or hireh, arc; best 
for kindlint^ an<l for a (juitdc fii'e. Hani woods, 
oak, ash, etc.,, burn more slowly, retain the heat 
Ioniser, and are better adapted for cooking 
purpc )ses. 

Coal (anthi-aeit«') is alxnit 95 per cent, carbon, coal 
Tt kindles slowly, <jives a steady heat, and burns 
for a loui^'er time without attention than wood. 
Stoves for ])urninif oil and i^as hav«; become 
popular, and are very convenient and satisfactory 
for eookin<^ puiposes. 

Oil is considered to be tin; cheapest fuel. on..

CARE or casior it "svill Ix; to kt'ep it clean. There slioiild 
})e plenty of (laniper.s that can hia used to hasten 
tlie fire or to check it. Learn tliorou^^hly the 
nianai^enient of the ran<;e before beifiiniinij to 
cook. In lightini( a tire, reni(jve the covers, 
brush the soot from the t<>p of the oven into the 
fire-box; clean out the grate (savint^ all the un- 
burned coal, and cinders). Put in shavings or 
paper, then kindling ari'anged crosswise, allowing 
plenty of air space between the pieces, a little 
liard wood and a sinHe laver of coal. Put on 
the covers, open the direct draft and ov<'n damper, 
then light the paper. When the wood is thor- 
oughly kindled and the first layer of coal heated, 
fill tlie fire-box with coal even with thi; top of 
the oven. When the blue flame becomes white, 
close the oven damper, and when the coal is burn- 
in<r freelv, shut the direct di'aft. When coal be- 
comes bright red all through it lias lost most of 
its heat. A great deal of coal is wasted by tilling 
the fire-box too full and leaving the di'afts open 
till the coal is red. T(j keep a steady fire it is 
better to add a little coal often ratlwr than to 
add a huge (piantity and allow it to burn 
out. Never allovr dust or cinders to accunndate 
around a range, either inside or out. Learn to 
open and shut the oven door (piietly and (piickly. 
Study the amount of fire re(|uired to heat the 
oven to the desired temperature. Learn which 
is the hotter or cooler side of the oven, and move 
the article whicii is being baked as re(|uired, 
being very caireful to move it gently.

Carrots and TrRxips. 

Carrots as a V(>o-etabl«3 for tlu^ table are more palatable 
when yoiin<r and tender. They should be washed and 
scraped, boiled until tend(,'r, and served with butter, 
pepper and salt or a white sauce. Tui-nips contain little 
nutriment; having no starch, they are very suitable foi- 
eating with potatoes. They re.piire more salt than any 
other vegetable, and should be served with fat meat, 
corned beef, roast pork or nnitton. Turnips shouM b,. 
washed, pared, cut into slices or strips, Ixjiled until 
tender. Drain, mash and season with pepper and salt. 

Peas (Green). 

Wasli the pods, which should be green, crisp and 
plump, before shelling, then the peas will not re(pn-re 
washing. Put the peas into a strainer or colander and 
sliake out all the tine particles. Boil mitil tender. 
Wlien nearly done add the salt. Use little water in 
cooking, when they may be served without draining; 
season with a little butter, pepper and salt. If draiixCM^ 
serve either dry with butter, pepper and salt, or with a' 
white sauce. 

Green- Sweet Corn. 

Remove the luisk and silky fi})re, cover with boiling 
water (the flavor is improvrd ]>y a<lding a i'rw of tlir 
clean inner husks) and cook, if young and t.'nd.-r, from 
10 to 15 minutes. Try a k.M-nel and take up the coi-n

SOUPS. 

Soups may be divided into two classes, soup made with 
stock, and witli milk. As soup should fc^rm part of 
the regular daily diet, and may be made from tlic 
cheaper materials, it is absohitely necessary tliat eveiy 
housekeeper should understand the art of making it 
23roperly. 

In the first plac3e it is well to know what may bo used 
in the process of soup making. The first and most im- 
portant step is to prepare the stock. For tliis purpose 
have a large earthen bowl or "catch all," as some teachers 
J call it. Into this put all the bones, trimmings, bits of 

steak or chop and gravy which has been left over. Keep 
in a cold place. When needed, cover with cold water an<l 
sinnner 4 or 5 hours; strain and set away to cool. When 
cold, remove the fat which will have formed a solid coat- 
ing on the top. The stock is now ready for use. By 
saving the remains of vegetables cooked for the tablr, 
the outer stocks of celery, a hard boiled q^;^^, etc., a \-eiy 
palatable and nutritious soup may be made at a ti-iilin^ 
cost. In families where huge quantities of meat ai'I 
used, there should be sufficient material without 
buying meat for soup. It is not necessary to luue all 
the ingredients mentioned in some recipes in order to 
secure satisfactory results. It will, however, be necssai-v 
to understand soup flavorings, so as to know which oik's 
may be left out. Stock made from Um shin (,f Invf, or 
from the cheaper pieces which contain t Ik; coars.-r fibre 
and gristle, refpiire long, slow cooking (see :\rethods). 

Never soak meat in water before cooking in unv form. 
Wipe carefully with a damp chjth before cutting or pre-

DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 



pariiijr for nso. For soup broiik or saw tlio Ijoiies into 
small pieces, and for oacli pound of meat and bone allow 
1 qt. of cold water. Cov(»r the kettle closely and let it 
heat slowly until it reaches the sinniit'rin<^ point, when 
it should be moved back and kept at that deforce for 
several hours. Soup slujuld never be allowed to boil 
hard. The scum which rises to the surface is the albu- 
men and juices of the meat, and shouhl not be skimnie<l 
ofi*. If the kettle is clean, and all impurities removed from 
the meat, there will not be anythin*;* ol)jectionable in the 
scum. Stociv nuist always be allowed to remain until 
cold, so that the fat may be removed before usinj^^ 
A stron<^, <:^reasy soup is rarely relished, an<] is one of 
the principal reasons why so many people dislike this 
valuable article of diet. Do not add salt to the meat 
which is beino' prepared for stock until a few minut<\s 
before removinfj from the fire. Salt hardens the water 
if added at first and makes the tissues more dithcult to 
dissolve. Stock may be kept for several days by occasion- 
ally briuij^ino' it to the boilin*^ point. This is not neces- 
sary in winter if it is kept in a cold place.

FISH. 

Fish is an invaluable article of food. It provides 
variety in diet, and while less stimulating than meat, is 
usually more easily di_L;vsted. I'^ish should be perfectly 
fresh and thoroughly cooke<l. The most wholescjmii as 
well as the most palatablt; metliods for cooking tish are 
l)roilin<x Jiud bakinix- The ilesli of fresh tish is tirni and 
will not retain the impress of the tinger if pressed into it. 
The eves should be brio-ht and iilassv, the i>il]s rvd and 
full of l)lo()d. Fish sIkjuM be cleaned as soon as possible 
and thoi'oughly wiped with a cloth wet in salt water, and 
sliould be kept in a cool place. Do not put it near other 
food such as milk, butter, etc., as they will absorb the 
odor. 

Broiled Fish. 

Ivub a double broiler well with a piece of suet before 
putting ill the fish. Lay the tish flat so that the flesh 
side will be exposed on one side of the broiler and the 
skin on the other. Bi-oil carefully, as the skin side 
burns very cpiickly. A flsh weighing ,S lljs. will take 
about 25 or ,S0 minutes to broil. When cooked sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and serve very hot.

MEAT. 

(See Auali/.'iiii, Chap. V). 

As moat is composed (jf s<'verjil substances, fi])rine, 

albumen, (gelatin, i'at and tlie juices, it is necessary to 

understand tlie various methods of cookin*; in order to 

s(!cure tlio best results. JMeat has its season as w^U as 

many other foods. Pork is better in autunni and 

winter: veal in the spring and sunnncr: i'owd in autumn 

and winter; lamb in the sunnner and autunni; nnitton 

and beef may bo used any time. IMeat should nut be 

allowed to remain in the paper in which it comes from 

market, as it absorbs the juices and injures the ilavor. 

Wipe all over with a clean wet cloth. Examine carefully, 

remove any tainted or unclean portions and keep in a 

clean, cool place until i'e(juired. Good l)eef should be a 

brit;-ht red color, well mixed with fat, and a layer of fat 

on the outside ; the suet should be dry and crumble 

easily. (See meat diagrams for difterent cuts.) IMutton 

shouM have an abundance of clear, white fat, the tiesh 

fine jxrained and a bri<dit red color. 'J'he fat of veal 

should be clear and white, the lean pink, and should 

always be thoroughly cooked. Pork is more indigestible 

when fresh than when cured, as in l)acon and ham. 

Fresh pork should be firm, the fat white, the lean a pale 

red. 

Roast of Beef. 

Wipe, trim, and tie or skewan* into shape the cut for 
roasting. If there be a large piece of the flank, cut it oti* 
and use for soups or stew^s. If you wish to roast it, turn 
it underneath and fasten with a skewer. Lay the meat 
on a rack in a pan, and dredge all over with flour. Put 



KECII'KS— MEAT.

on the top of a roast 2 or ,3 tbsps. of dripping or pieces 
of the fat; put it in a very liot oven at first. After the 
outside lias become seared, check off the heat and allow- 
to cook slowly, basting frecjuently. (See time table for 
baking.) 

Bkoilki) Steak. 
Trim the steak free from all sn<'t (save all trinniiings 
for stews or the stock pot). Put the meat plate to warm, 
grease the broiler with a little of the fat. See that the' 
fire is clear. Put the steak on the hot broiler and place 
it over the lire, turning eviny 10 seconds. It will take 
about 8 minutes if the steak is 1 inch thick. When 
done, place it on the hot plate, dredge it with salt and 
pepper; turn over and season the other side. Serve 
immediately. 

Pan-Broiled Steak. 
When the fire is not suitable for broiling, heat the 
frying pan until smoking hot; trim the steak as for 
broiling, place firmly on the hot pan, turn frecpiently as 
in broiling, with a broad knife or pancake turner ; never 
insert a fork, as it allows the juice to escape. It will 
cook in 10 minutes. Season, and serve the same as 
broiled steak. If a gravy is desired, fry a little of the 
suet and trimmings in the pan— after the steak has 
been removed— until brown, lift out the meat or suet, 
add 1 tbsp. of flour, stir until bi-own, add pepper and salt 
to taste, then add 1 teacup of boiling water. Cook for 
2 or 8 minutes and strain over the steak.

Fried Bacon. 

Cut into very thin slices, put into a very hot frying 
pan, and cook until clear and crisp. 

Sausace. 

Prick tlie skins with a sliai-p fork so as to prevent 
burstin<^ ; place them in a frying pan over a moderate 
fire and fry in their own fat until a nice brown. After 
taking the sausage from the pan, add 1 tbsp. of flour to 
the fat in the pan, add 1 cup of boiling water, stir until 
it boils, pour over the sausage and serve. 

LiVKii AND Bacon. 

Have the bacon cut in thin slices and keep it cold 
until the time to cook it. Havt; the liver cut into slices 
about J of an inch thick. If it be calf or sheep's liver, 
wash it in cold water and let it drain ; but if it be beef 
liver, after washing it, cover with boiling water and let 
it stand for 5 minutes, then drain it. Cook the bacon as 
directed, then take it up. Lay the slices of liver in the 
hot fat, cook them for 8 or 10 minutes, turning often : 
season with pepper and salt. Arrange the liver on a 
warm platter, make a gravy as directed in other recipes, 
pour over the liver, placing the bacon round the outside. 
(Always cook bacon quickly and liver slowly.) 



POULTRY. 

The best cliickens have soft yellow feet, short thick

slip the skin back from the neck and cut the neck otl* 
close to the body, leavino- skin enough to fold over on the 
back. Remove the windpipf, pull the crop away from 
the skin on the neck and breast, and cut oft' cl()S(.' to the

inclies below^ the leg joint, bend the Irg at the cut l)y 
pressing it on the edge of tlu^ table and break otK the

cut only through the skin, these cords may be pulled out 
easily, one at a time, ^vith the fingers; or hy putting 
the foot of the fowl against the casing of a dooi-, then 
shut the door tightly and pull on the leg. '^Fhe drum

can reach in beyond the liver and heart, and loosen on 
either side down toward the back. Draw ever\th.ini»: 
out carefully. See that the kidneys and lungs are not 
left in, and be very careful not to break any of the 
intestines. When the fowl has been cleaned carefully it 
will not require nnich washing. Rinse out the inside 
quickly and wipe dry. In stuffing and trussing a fowl, 
place the fowl in a ])owd and put the stuffing in at the

should be very thick. Add the seasoning, and mix it 
while hot with the meat or flsh. It is improved by 
adding a beaten egg just before the sauce is taken from 
the fire. When cold, shape into rolls or like a pear, roll

CAKE. 

There .are practically two kinds of cake, that made 
with butter, and cake made without butter. When 
these two methods are understood, cake making becomes 
easy. A few simple rules must govern all cake making.

baking, do it quickly and without jarring the stove. 
10th. To find out if it is baked, run a broom straw 
through the centre, if no dough adheres the cake is done. 
11th. If browning too quickly, cover with brown paper 
and reduce the heat gradually. This is usually neces- 
sary in baking fruit cake. 12th. Mix cake in an earthen 
bowl, never in tin. LSth. Soda, cream of tartar, and 
baking powder should be crushed and sifted with the 
flour. Always attend to the fire before beginning to 
make rake. Coarse gi*anulated sugar makes a coarse, 
heavy ca.ce. If cake browns before rising the oven is too 
hot. When it rises in the centre and cracks open it is 
too stiff' with flour. It should rise first round the edge, 
then in the middle and remain level.

PASTRY. 

Pastrv, unless liirlit and tender, slunild never be eaten: 
even tlien it sliould be avoided by people with poor 
digestion. There are so many food preparations sujjerior 
to pastry in both nutritive vahie and cost of time and 
material, that it will be wise to give it a very secondary 
place in the training of a culinary artist. However, as 
it is still a popular fancy with many, we may as well 
make the best of it. Butter is more wholesome in pastry 
than lard, although the latter makes a light crust. In 
order to secure satisfactory results in pastry making — 
especially puti' pastry — three things should be observed: 
(1) liave all the materials cold ; (2) use as little liijuid as 
possible; (8) handle lightly and (|uickly. Pastry should 
be very cold when it is put into the oven. Have the 
oven very hot. 

Puff Paste. 



1 lb. flour. 
1 lb. butter. 



Enough ice water to iiuike into 
a very stiff dough. 



If the butter is saltv, wasli it as follows : Scald a 
large bowl, tlien fill with cold water; wash the hands in 
hot soapy water, then rinse them in cold water, as this 
will prevent the butter from sticking to the liands. Turn 
the cold water out of the bowl ; fill it with ice water, put 
the butter into it and work with the hands until soft an<l 
elastic. Drain the water frcjm the butter and place on 
ice until liard. Sift the flour, put \ of the Imtter into 
the flour, cut with a knife or chopping knife until 
thoroughly mixed ; then gradually add ice water until 
it is moist enough to hold toirethcr, tui'ii out on tlu; 
board or marble slab. Press into shape, roll lightly until

the roll keep the layers one above the other, not turning

pastry, roll five or six: times, provided it is not allowed to

Cold food shoulil ])v. served very cold. A little (jfarnish 
of parsley, hai'd-b<)ile<l e^'-g, sliced lemon, toast, water- 
cress or centre of a lettuce head adds mucli to the 
attractiveness of a dish. Small rolls, a S(juare of bread, 
or croutons should be served with scnip. Sliced lemon 
with fish. Cold beets, carrots, turnips, and the whites 
of hard-boiled eggs, stamped out with a fancy vegetable 
cutter, make a pretty garnish for cold meats. Toast cut 
into trianMes makes a suitable ijarnish for manv dishes. 

Whi])ped cream is tlie most delicatt^ garnish for all 
cold, light puddings; a little coloring may be added to 
part of it in order to vary the decoration.

Ca\\i\<} and 1M{i;skhvi\<j. 

C.'uiniuL^ fiMiit is simply stci'ili/in^ and scaling in air- 
ti;^lit jars. Any Iresh ripii fruit may be kept in this way. 
By (jbsL'i'viiii^ a few <ij«Mi(?ral rulrs any boust'kecjxT may 
preserve i'ruit successful ly. 1st. Have j^^ood fruit, r\[)o 
ajid fresh. 2nd. Have air-tiglit jars - test by UllinL^ with 
water and invertinjjf. 3rd. See that the j.-n-s have bcm well 
scalded Jind are i'vi'n from odor of any kind. 4th. Have 
rims and covers at hand so that the jars may be sealed 
immediately when the fruit is put into thnn. 5th. Fill the 
jars till they (nrrflow. (1th. Let the syi-up simmer for 
a few minutes bcfoi'c pnttin<j^ in the fruit. 7th. Cook 
the fi'uit slowly so as to avoid breakini;* ; place carefully 
in the jai's, fill up with syru[) and seal at once. A (j;ood 
method for cannintj^ fruit is to cook the fruit in the jars, 
b}^ placiuLC them in a boiler or kettle of watrr with .a 
wire fi'amc or somethinjx underneath to avoid bi-('akin<»;. 
Fill the jai- with fruit ; pour over a syrup of the desired 
consistency, sci'ew on the top loosely — so as to allow tin; 
^as to escape — ai»d place in the boiler ; till the boiler with 
cold water up to the i-im of the jar and bring slowly to 
boilin*.^ point. Allow small fi'uits to remain 10 minutes, 
and peaches, pears, etc., 15 minutes after the water boils. 
Remove the tops, fill to (nerilowing with boiling syrup, 
and seal at once. By this method fruit retains the flavor 
somewhat UKJi'e than by cooking in an open kettle. An 
average syrup for canning fruit is made by adding a 
pound of sugar to a pint of water (see rule (i). In order 
to prevent fi'uit jars from cracking, wring a cloth out of 
cold water on which the jar should be plaecil befortj 
tilling with the hot fi'uit, oi* by placing a silver s])oon or 
fork in the jar befoi'e [Hiring in the syrup, fruit or jelly.

128 



DOMESTIC SCIKNCE. 



Always Kce that the tops are screwed on ti^litly before 
puttinj,^ the jar away in a cool place, which should not 
be done until the fruit has become cold. 

I*11KSEHVIN(J. 

Preservin;^ diH'ei's from cannin<^ in the amount of su<,nir 
us(m1 ; otherwise the method is similar. Preserves are 
usually mad(! fi'om e(|ual weights of suj^ar and fruit, and 
cooked at least 20 minutes. 

Jellies. 

Fruit jellies an; made of e(iual parts of clear fruit juice 
and su<^ar. Crab apples, currants, and quinces are the 
most reliable fruits for jelly. Cook the fruit— currants 
may be mashed and drained without cooking — until soft. 
Drain over night through a ilannel bag. In the morn- 
ing measure 1 pint of sugar for each pint of juice. Heat 
the sugar in a large earthen bowl in the oven, stirring 
often to prevent burning. Let the juic»; ])oil 20 minutes; 
then add the liot sugar and l)oil about 5 minutes longer, 
or until it thickens when dropped from a spoon. 



SUGGESTIONS FOR YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS. 

Carefully supervise the daily dietary so that a reason- 
able proportion of the necessary food elements may be 
provided. See that the proportion of proteid is one part 
to four of carboh^^lrates and fats. Adapt the dietary to 
the season and climate. Do not waste time and money 
in preparing rich puddings, entrees, cakes, etc., when fresh 
fruit, vegetables, salads, etc., are so nmch more nutritious, 
economical and convenient. Arrange to have a variety

of food — (lifforcnt kinds of incut, fisli.jiiid poultry — cooked 
in various ways. See tliat suitable food is provided for 
the children; especially pure milk and food containing 
mineral salts. Do not allow children to use tea, cofi'ee, 
or other stimulants. A (,dass of hot milk (not boiled) is 
the best stimulant for a child when wearied with study 
or over exertion of any kind. 

See that the water which has stood in the pipes over

water u.sed for drinkinj^ purposes is j^ure ; if suspicious, 
either liave it filtered or })oiled ])efoie usin<x. Do not 
allow soiled raj^^s, dish cloths or towels to lie around the 
kitchen. Wash and scald the dish cloths and towels 
after each dish washintj^, han^inj^ them outside to dry 
— if possible. Keep plenty of clean towels; some tine 
ones for <rlass and china, coarser ones for general use. 
Have special cloths for kitchen use. Keep a holder 
within reach of the oven so as to avoid bui-niuir the 
tin<;ers, or using an apron. See that a kettleful of 
boiling water is poured down the sink pipes every day. 

All boxes, jars and shelves in which food is kept, nuist 
be kept scrupulously clean and well aired. 'J'he refriger- 
ator recpiires special attention ; see that the drain pipe 
and interior of ice-box are kept thoroughly clean. A stiti*

cloth. Burn all refuse, both for convenience and as a 
sanitary measure. If a refuse pail is used, it should be 
scalded fre(iuently and a solution of carbolic acid, chloride 
of lime or other disinfectant used. Do not put pans and 
kettles half filled with water on the stove to soak, as 
it only hardens whatever may have adhered to the 
kettle and makes it more difficult to clean. 

Dish Washixcj. 

Many young housekeepers look upon dish washing 
as the "buiT-bear" of the kitchen. It need not be 
disagreeable work ; indeed the washing of china, glass 
and si: -er ware may be placed among the arts of house- 
keeping. It should be the ambition of every young 
housekeeper to know how everything pertaining to 
household management should be done, and how to do 
it ; whetlier she has to do it herself or direct otheis. 

One of the most important duties is dish-washing. A 
few simple rules may help to make this duty less objec- 
tionable. 1. Collect knives, forks and spoons by them- 
selves. Scrape the dislies, empty the cu[)s, and arrange 
neatly in the order in which they are to be washed. 
2. Never pile dishes indiscriminately in a dish pan, as each 



kind

then rinse in the clt^ar hot water; wipe while warm. 
8. Change dish water often, especially if the dishes 
are greasy; and do n(3t leave the soap in the water to 
waste and stick to the <lishes. 9. Use fresh water for 
the kitchen crockery, and pots and pans. After wiping 
tinware, place it on tlu^ lusirth to dry, as it rusts very 
easily. 10. l\>lish the knives with bath])nck, wood 
ashes or sandsoap. Wash, and wipe perfectly diy ; hoKl 
in the hand and wash with the dish cloth ; do not under 
any cii'cumstances allow knives and forks to lie in hot 
watin*. Next wash the tray, the rinsing pan, the table and 
the sink. Finally, the dish towels, dish cloth and dish 
pan. 

Pans in which fish or onions have been cooked should 
be washed and scalded, then filled with water, in which 
put a tsp. of soda. Place them on the top of the stove 
for h liour; this will remove the fiavor of fish or onions,

Ventilation and Sanitation. 



Ah pure air is one of the ess(3iitijils of j^ood liesilth, it 
folhnvs tliat one of tlie chief duties of a liousekeeper is 
to see that tlie family siipply of tliis iK'cessary eh^ment is 
properly regulated. Very few liousekeejjers realize the 
importance of ventilation in promoting the general 
liealth and comfort of the family. As tlie scope of this 
book prevents anything further than a few suggestions 
or a brief outline of the principles underlying these im- 
portant questions, we will adopt the rule followed in tlie 
preceding chapter, beginning with the cellar : 1. See 
that surface water is carried away from all sides, by 
cither natural or artificial drains, and that the cellar is 
perfectly dry. Have enough windows in the cellar to 
secure plenty of light and air, and see that they are opened 
every day. 2. Have the cellar thoroughly' chsaned ami 
whitewashed with lime at least once a ye«':r, twice if pos- 
sible, in the spring and fall. 3. Keep the coal in a dry 
place, 4. Do not allow decomposed vegeta])les, or old 
bottles, which may cause unpleasant odors, to accumulate 
in the cellar. Unless there is a special cellar for vege- 
tables, where they may be kept at a ])roper temperature 
and carefully looked after, it is much better for the 
liousekeeper to j)urchase in small ([uantities. llemember 
the ventilation of the cellar is of the greatest importance, 
and should never be neolected. 



One of the most note(l authoi'ities in America, on the 
question of ventilation, s.iys : "The three; important 
objects are, (1) To provide an abundance of pure air in 
every part of the house; (2) To avoid drafts, either liot 
or cold ; (3) To provide means of escape for foul air and

odors," As ])(>foro stated, iniicli of th(^ vii^or, ooinfort and 
happiness of th(i family depends upon attention to tlieso 
matters. Next to the cellar, we will take the livinir and 
sleepint^ rooms, whieli should be tlun-ou^jhly air*'(l every 
day, not simply by opening the window a ffw inches 
at the bottom, or— as in S(jme<lou))h.' or outside windows — 
by a little opening a few inches wide; but by causing a 
circulation of air in the room, and providing an outlet for 
foul air near the ceiling, which may be done by lowering 
the window from the top. An outlet for foul air is (piite 
as important as an iidet for fresh air. 

If there is a skylight at the top of the house, it should 
be kept oj)en a few inches all the time as an outlet for 
impure air; an attic window will serve the same purpose. 
Have doors and win<lows so arran<jed that a draft mav 
be made possible when needed to change the air of a 
room (juickly, or in airing bedclothes ; two windows being 
<jf course more desirable. After dressing in the morning, 
open the window of the sleeping room, top and bottt)m ; 
turn back the clothes over one or two chairs; place 
pillows an<l mattress wdiere tluy will have a curi'ent of 
fresh air; also open the closet door. Do not allow water 
to remain in a bedroom more than twentvd'our hours. 

When a sleeping room has been used for a sewing or 
sitting room during the day, it should be thoroughly 
aired before bedtime. Open the bathi'oom window fre- 
(|Uently, top and bottom, for a few minutes, so as to allow 
the air to escape out of doors instead of into other j)arts 
of the house. A nursery, sitting room or school I'oom, 
which has been occupii'd by a nund)er of people, should 
have the windows o})en, top and bottom, while liie occu- 
jiants are at meals or elsewhere. A room which has been

retii'e, in oivlcr to prevent the impure air making its way 
thron<j|;h the Ixnise duiiui,' the ni<'ht. 

Special attention shcmld be given to kitchen ventila- 
tion. Jn order to prevent kitchen odors from penetrating 
through tlu; other parts of the house, it is necessary to 
have an outlet f'jr steam and impure air near the ceiling 
in the kitchen. If windows are placed so as to secure a 
draft, they may be opened at the top only, when tliey 
will serve the purpose adiiiiral)ly. There should be a 
ventilating Hue in all kitchen chimneys. In building a 
house, see that register ventilat(;rs are placed in the 
kitchen on diH'erent walls, which may be closed in very 
cold weather. 

Laundry Work. 

As the first essential of laundry work is a plentiful 
supply of water, a word concerning that necessaiy article 
may not be out of place. Pure water is a chemical com- 
pound of hydrogen and oxygen. It has great absorbent 
and sol ve)it powers, therefore pure water is seldom found. 
The first fall of any shower is mixed with the impurities 
of the air; among these may be acids, anniionia and 
carbon in the foi'm of soot and creosote. It is these 
impurities which cause the stain left when rain water 
stands on the window-sill or other finished wood. Rain 
water absorbs uiore or less carbon dioxide from various 
sources, and soakin<>' into the soil oft«'n comes in contact 
with lime, magnesia and other compounds. Water 
saturated with carbon dioxide will dissolve these sub-

sub- 



stances, foniiiiiir carbonates or other salts wliicli are 
soluble ; such water is known as " hard." 

Water for domestic uses is called either " hard " or 
"soft," according to the amount of salts which it may 
contain. When soap is added to hard water, the new 
compound formed by the union of the lime with the 
fatty acid of the soap is insoluble, and is deposited upon 
the sui-fac(; of any article with which it comes in contact. 
This is the reason why "liard " water rccpiires more soap 
when used for laundry work. It is nmch better to soften 
tlie water by the addition of alkalies, annnonia or sal- 
soda before u.sin<jj for laundry purposes thau to depend 
entirely upon soap for cleansing. 

Another important material used in the laundry is soap. 
In purcliasing soap, it is safer to choose the make of some 
well-known firm, who have a reputation to lose if their 
products are not good ; and for anything stronger than 
soap, it is ))etter to buy sal -soda and use it knowingly 
than to trust to the various packages so extensively 
advertised. Washin<r soda should alwavs be dissolved in 
a separate vessel, and added to the water to be used. 
Annnonia may be us(3d, but its too frecpient use will 
yellow bleached fabrics. Borax is an effectual cleanser, 
disinfectant and bh'acher. It is more expensive than 
ammonia or soda but is the safest alkali to use. Turpen- 
tine is valuable in removing grease ; 1 tbsp. to a quart of 
water will serve for washiniT silks and other dehcate 
materials. It should never be used in hot water. 

RrnioviiKj Staiiif^. — All spots and stains should be 
taken out before the clothes are put into tlie g»'n(!ral 
wash to be treated with soap. Fruit stains are the most 



136 



DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 



i 



fre(juent and tli(3 most iiulc^liblo, wlion m'<^lecto<l. Tlie 
composition of fruit jnico is rcsidily (lissolv«'(l by boiling 
water. Strctcli tbo stained part over an eartlieii disli 
and pour boilinj^ water upon tlie stain until it disappears. 
If fruit stains are allowed to remain, they will re(piire 
an acid, or in some cases a bleaching li(|uid like chloride 
of lime to remove them. Wine stains should be 
innnediately covered with a thick layer of salt. Boilin*;" 
milk may ])e us(mI for takin<^ out wine or fi'uit stains. 
Medicine stains usually yield to alcohol. Iodine dissolves 
in ether or chloroform. 

Cott'ee, t<'aand cocoa stain badly; the latter, if neglected, 
will resist to the destruction of the fabric. These all 
contain tannin, besides various coloring matters, and are 
" tixed " by soap and water. Clear boiling water will 
often remove fresh cott'ee and tea stains, althouii'h it is 
safer to si)rinkle the stains with borax and soak in cold 
water iirst. An alkaline solution of great use and 
convenience is Javelle water. It will remove stains and 
is a general bleacher. It is composed of 1 lb. of sal-soda 
with J lb. (if chloride of lime in 2 quarts of boiling 
water. When the substances have dissoKed as much as 
they will, and become cool and settled, pour off the clear 
licpiid and bottle it for use. Be careful not to allow any 
of the solid portions to pass into the bottle. Use the 
dregs for scouring inipainted woodwork, or to cleanse 
waste pipes. When a spot is found on a white table- 
cloth place under it an inverted plate. Apply .lavelle 
water with a soft tooth brush (the use of the brush i)ro- 
tects the skin and the nails). Hub gently till the stain 
disappears, then rinse in clear watrr and finally in 
ammonia. Blood stains reijuire clear cold or tepid water ; 



st'(!(}EsTi()N's For vorxc; iiorsKKKErKus. 1.S7 



hot water and soap render tlie re(l colorin*^ matter less 
soluble. When the stain is nearly e-one soap and lujt 
water may be used. Stains from meat juiee should be 
treated in the same way. When blood is mixed with 
nnieous, as in the case of handkerchiefs, it is well to soak 
the stains for some liours in a solution of salt and cold 
water — 2 tablespoonfuls to a (juart. ( Jrass stains dissoU e 
in alcoliol. If applied immediat«'ly, amuKjnia and water 
will sometimes wash them out. 

Tlie following; metlKxls liaye proved successful, and 
may be tried where colors are likely to \nt atiected by 
alcohol. Molasses, or a paste of soap and cookin<jj soda 
may be spread over the stain and left for some liouis, or 
the stain may bi; kept moist in the sunshine tuilil the 
<j;reen color has changed to brown, when it will wash out 
in pure water. I^rihlew re( pii res ditfe rent treatment from 
any pi-eviously considered. Strong soap suds, a layer of 
s(jft soap and pulverized chalk, or one of chalk and salt, 
are all elective, if in addition the moisten«'d cloth ])e 
su])jected to stron^; sunlight, which kills the plant and 
bleaches tlie fibre. Javelle water niay be trie(l in cases 
of advanced growth, l)ut success is not always assured. 
Some of the animal and vegetable oils may be taken out 
by soap and cold water, or diss(jlved in na})htha, chloro- 
form, ether, etc. Some of the vegetable oils are solul)l(! 
in hot alcohol (care being taken that the temperature be 
not raised to the point of igniting). \'aseline stains 
should be soaked in kei'osene before water and soap 
touch them. 

Tidv spots on white goods are the same in character as 
on colored fabrics. Where the iidv is an iron compcjund, 
the stain may be treated with oxalic, muriatic or hot

tartaric acid, applied in tlic same manner as for iron 
rust stains. No definite rule can be ^iven, for some inks 
are afi'ected by stroni^ alkalies, otliers by aci<ls, while 
some will dissolve in clear water. Red iron rust spots 
must be treated with acid. Fill an oartlu'ii dish two- 
thirds full of hot water and stretch the stained cloth over 
this. Have two other dishes with clear water in one and 
ammonia water in the other. The steam from the hot 
water will furnish the heat and moistun? favorable for 
chemical action. Drop a little nuu'iatic acid on the stain; 
let it remain a moment, then lower the cloth into the 
cle.'ir water. Repeat until the stain disappears. Rinse 
carefully in the clear water and thially inunerse in the 
ammonia water, that any excess of acid may be neutral- 
ized and the fabric protected. Salt and leuion juice are 
often sufficient for a slii^ht stain. 

Many spots appear upon white goods, which n^semble 
those made by iron rust, or the fabrics themselves accpiire 
a vellowish tiiiire. This is the result of the use of blueiuiX 
and soap, where the clothes have been imperfectly rinsed. 
Therefore, if all dirt is removed, and the clothes thor- 
oughly rinsed from all soap or alkalies used in removing 
the dirt, and exposed for a long time to air and sunshine, 
the use of blueing is unnecessary. In cities, where con- 
veniences for drying and bleaching in the sunshine are 
few, a thorough bleaching two or three times a year is a 
necessity; but in the country it is wiser to abolish all use 
of blueing and let the sun, in its action with moisture 
and the oxygen of the air, keep the clothes white and 
pure. Freezing aids in bleaching, for it retains the 
moistun^ upon which the sun can act so much longer. 
When clean grass, dew and sunshine are not available,

Whether to ))oil clothes or not, depends lar<rely upon 
the i)uritv'' < >' the materials used and the care exercised. 
Many feel that the additional disinfection which boiling 
insures, is an element of cleauTiess not to be disi'en;arde(l, 
while others insist that boiling yellows the clothes. This 
yellowness niay b; caused by impure material in the 
soap, the deposit of iron from the water or the boiler; 
the imperfect washin<]^ of the clothes, that is, the oi^anic 
matter is not thorou<ji;hly removed. The safer process is 
to put the clotlies into cold Avater, with little or no soap, 
let the temperature rise gradually to boilin*^ point and 
remain there for a few miiuites. Soap is nujre readily 
dissolved by hot than bv cold water, hence the boilini^ 
should help in the complete removal of the soap, and

All wool j>oo<ls recjuire the ^i-eatest care in wasliing. 
The ditferent waters used should ])e of tlie same tempera- 
tui"e, and never too liot to be borne comfortably by tlie 
lian<ls. Soap should always be used in the form of a 
solution. No soap should bo rubbed on the fabric, and 
only a <^)od white soap, free from resin, or a soft potash 
soap is allowable. j\Iake each water slif^htly soapy, and 
leave a very little in the fabric at the last rinsiii^r^ in 
order to furnish a dressin(j^ as nearly like the original as 
possible. Annnonia or borax is sometimes used in pre- 
ference to soap. For pure white tlannel borax is the 
most satisfactory, on account of its bleaching quality. 
Only enough of any alkali should be used to make the 
water vei'V soft. 

Wool fibres collect nmch dust, and should therefore be 
thoroughly brushed or shaken before the fabric is put 
into the water. Woollen fabiics should be cleansed bv 
scpieezing, and not by rubbing. Wool should not be 
wrung by hand. Either run the fabric smoothly through

combu.stible, if used in stron*^ solution after tlu^ final 
rinsing. Dish cloths and dish towt'ls nnist Im; kept clean 
as a matter of liealth, as well as a necessity for clean, 
bri(^ht tableware. The greasy dish cloth furnishes a 
most favorable field for the gi'owth of ecrms. It must 
be washed with soap and hot water and dried thoroughly 
eacli time. All such cloths should form part of the 
weekly wash and receive all the disinfection possible, 
with soap, Jiot water and long drying in the sunshine 
and open air. Beware of the disease-breeding, greasy, 
damp, dish cloth hung in a warm, dark j)lace. Oven 
towels, soiled with soot, etc., niay be soaked over night 
in just enough kerosene to cover, then washed in cold 
water and soap. 

Laundry tubs should b(^ carefully washed an<l dried. 
Wooden tubs, if kept in a dry place, should be turned

is the ventilation of the sick room. Care nnist In; taken 
that the air is not vitia.te(l by an^'thing in the roou), such 
as a kerosene lamp, wilte<l cut flowers, soiled clothing, 
etc. The bed should be so arranged as to avoid a draft 
— especially when airing the room. If the room is too 
small to allow this, a very good way to protect the 
patient is to raise an umbrella and place it over tho liead 
and shoulders; over this put a bl.-inket while the room is 
beinijf aired; allowin<i: it to remain \nitil the room has 
reached the desired i,emperature again. Never tun. t)

Ono of the most important essentials in a siek i-ooiii is

some varieties are provided, in accordance with the

objectionable and unappetizing forms of serving food. 
Do not allow fresh fruit, which is intended for th«i 
])atient, to remain in the sick nxmi, l)ut keep in a cool 
place and serve when needed. Never visit a sick room

Berf Tni (X<K 2). — Put a pound of finely minced beef 
into a ^dass fruit jar, add a pint of cold water. Let it 
stand for an hour, stiri'inj^ and pressing occasionally. 
Place the jar in a kettle of water; place over the fire 
and allow the water to reach boiling point. Move back 
where the water will just sininicr for an hour, keeping 
the jar closely covered. Strain the beef tea through a 
tine wire strainer; allowing the fine sediment to pass 
through, which should be drunk with the licpiid. Flavor 
with salt. (For an especially stnjng beef stinnihint, see 
recipe for Bouillon, in a former chapter.)

of al)sor[)(ion and assimilation. The food must be 
abundant, and of the character to fui'uish new tissue, and 
to yiehl enerey in the form of heat and muscular activity. 
The food should also coi:tain salts of lime to meet the 
re()uirements of formation of the bones and teeth. Many 
children ac(|uire habits of dislike for certain articles of 
food, which become so fixed in later life that they find it 
very inconvenient, especially when placed in circum- 
stances, as in ti'avelling, where (nie cannot always obtain 
the accustouied diet ; it therefoje is unwise to cultivate 
such habits, which are often a serious obstacle to normal

cases of ana'niia and cldorosis, whieli are so connnonly 
ser'n in youni^ ^irls, are directly traceal)]e to a faulty 
diet. It should be the imperative duty of all teachers 
to C()nsider the responsibility of ri^jhtly developin^j;' tlu* 
physical constitutions of those entrusted to their care. 
They should remember that the mind keej)S on (h'veloj)-

individual is estal)lishe(l for tlw; n-mainder of life. At

•greater importance than success in m«'ntaJ attainments." 
(Thompson.) 

An important consideration in school diet is to avoid 
monotony, which becomes so conunon from economic 
reasons, or morci ofti'ii from carelessness. It is so nnich 
easier to yield to i-(;utineaud force of habit than to study 
the (piestion. The hours for study and for meals should 
be so re;:ulated that sutlicient timt; will Ixj allowed 
befon; each meal for children to wash and })iepar(^ them- 
selves comfortably without f;"oin;^ to the table excited by 
hurry, and theyshouM be retjuired to remain at the table 
for a lixed time, and not allowed to hastily swallow theii* 
food in order to complete an milinislu'd tasl< or eame. 
An interval of at h'ast half an hour should intervener 
after meals before any mental exertion is i'e(|uired. C'on- 
stant nibblinif atfood betw<.'en meals should l)e forbidden ; 
it destroys the appetite, increases the .saliva, and inter-

.sentence and for its effect upon the muscles and nerves. 
It is being more and more realized ])y tlie })u])lic in 
general, that the Livaking down oi liealtli at scliool is 
more often due to im|)(jverished nutrition tlian to over- 
work. Delicate children should not be allowed too long 
intervals between meals, as for instance, the evening 
me;d at six o'clock and breakfast the following morning 
at seven or lialf past. A glass of milk and a piece of 
whole wheat l)rea<l and butter should be given — if tliey 
awaken — durintf the ni«dit. ])elicate children whose 
a[)petites are poor, and who do not do proper justice to 
their regular meals, should be given an extra allowance 
of hot broth or hot milk with bread and butter, between 
meals. 

These rules are applicable in cases of childn^n who, 
during one or two years, seem to develop with exti'aordin- 
ary rapidity, growing souK^times two inches or more in 
six months. The demands of this rapid growth nnist be 
met by proper nutrition, or serious subse(|uent inqiair- 
ment of vitality may result. Such children should have 
their meals made tempting l)y good cooking and pleasant 
variety, ns well as an agreeable appearance of the food. 
]Meat which is carved in unsightly masses and vegetables 
which are sodden and tasteless will be refused, and an 
ill attempt is made to supply the deficiency in proper 
fool by eating indigestible candy, nuts, etc. Children 
often have no natural liking for meat, and prefer 
puddings, pastry or sweets when they can obtain them; 
it is therefore more important that meat and other 
wholesome foods should be made attractive to them at 
the age when they need it.

SUGGESTIONS FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN'S DIET. 

If early risiiif^ is insisted upon, a child should never 
be set at any task before breakfast, espc'cially in winter; 
and if it is not expedient U) serve a full breakfast at 
half-past six or seven, the child should be <(iven a bowl 
of milk and ])reud, a cup of cocoa with a roll or other 
light food. Breakfast may Ixi served later, after the 
first exercises of the moiriin*:^, and should c(jnsist of 
porridge of wheaten«irits, hominy, fish, eggs, fruit (raw or 
cooked), bread and butter. ])inner, which should always 
be served near the middle of the day, shouM compi-ise 
meat, potatoes, one or two green vegetables, some form 
of light pudding or sweet. Supper, it is genei'ally ad- 
mitted, should comprise easily digested articles of food ; 
such substances as pastry, cheese and meats are better 
omitted ; it should consist of a porridge, with milk or 
cream, or a light, farinacious pudding of rice, tapioca or 
sago, with bread and butter, and some simple form of 
preserve, stewed apples or prunes, or veiy light, plain 
cake. A good bowl of nutritious broth — or soup — with 
bread or crackers, may be substituted for the porridge 
or pudding. It will sometimes be f(jund best to serve 
this meal at seven or half-past seven o'clock : in this 
case the child should be given a slice of bread and butter 
or a glass of milk (drinking it slowly), at half-past four 
or five. 

Some of the more important articles of school diet 
recpiire special mention ; the following extract from Dr. 
Thompson's Practical Dietectics may prove helpful : — • 

Bread. — " Bread, as a rule, should be made of whole 
meal, but must not be too coarse. The advantage of this

once a day when fish or e<j;;ijs are supplied; it sIkjuM, 
however, be <(iven at least onc(j daily, to rapidly growing 
children." 

Sicerts. — " The greater mnnber of children have a 
natural craving for sweets." 

The energy developed in active childhood necessitates 
the consumption of a larger propcjrticjn of sugar than is 
recpiired by adults. The craving of children for con- 
fections, can<ly, etc., furnishes a true iiulicatiou of the 
actual requirements of nature, an«l it nnist ])e admitted 
that a certain amount of wholesome candy not only does 
most children no harm, but may serve them as an 
excellent food. The Uiain ditiiculty with such forms of

TXKANTS' DIET. 

()\iv of tlir most important sul)j«'('ts included in n 
domestic! scicnci' courst! of study is tlic rcedinir and care 
of inlants. A sultjcct iT(jniriM<; special inteHi<^ence and 
consideration ; on(^ which endxtdii's the condensed infor- 
mation of the prece(lin;4 ciiajiters, and is th(^ foundation 
upon winch the future physical structure is huilt. 

]t is not upon the motliei* alone that th(! baby depends 
for care and attention. Many younjjj j^irls, esju^cially 
elder sisters and nurse-maids, have this responsiblllly 
placed upon them when they are little more than 
children themselves. Tt) these, as well as to y()Un<^ 
mothers, the followin<^ su^'i;*estions may prove helpful. 

The first demand of an iid'ant is for food, and upon 
the quality and (piantity of the article provided di'pends 
the health of the child, as well as the comfort of the 
liousehold. 

JMilk is the only food re([uired by an infant until it is, 
at least, seven or ei;^ht months old, or until sutUcient 
saliva is secreted to assist di;j^estion ; some authorities 
say one ytsar, others until the child has sulHcient teeth 
with which to masticate food. If nature's supply is 
not available, or sutHcient, tlie best substitute is cow's 
milk. As cow's milk contains less su^ar of milk, and 
fat (cr»>am), than Innuan milk, these must be supplied. 
Bein«j^ more acid than alkaline, this must be corrected by 
the use of lime water. 

There is more casein (curd) in cow's milk tlian in 
mother's milk, theri'fore water nnist be added to reduce 
this. The following j)roportions have been submitted as 



infants' dikt.

Temperature of Food. 

Food .should bo " milk warm," or about 90^ Fah., when 
^ivcn to a baby. Hot food is very injurious. 

Nursing Bottles and Feeding. 

Have two plain bottles with rubber to]i^, ivifhoiU tubes. 
T>ottlos with ounces and tablespoon fuls marked on thom 
can be purchased, an<l are a great convenience in measur- 
ing the amount of food required. 

A ftor using the lx)ttle, empty the remaining milk ; rinse 
in cold water, then in .scalding water. 

If particles of milk adhere to the bottle use coarse salt 
or raw potato cut in small piecc^s. If the glass looks 
cloudy, add a little ammonia to the water. Turn the 
I'ubber tops inside out and scrub with a stift' brush ; boil 
them every alternate day for 10 miinites. 

A}>solufe rleauliness is a vecessifi/ in the care of a 
baby's f(x)d, bottles and rubber tops. 

The bottle should be held, while the baby is fiuiding, in 
such a position that the top is fdll of milk. If air is 
sucked in with the milk stonach-ache will likelv result. 

Starchy food should not be given to a child until it is 
able to masticate. (See digestion of starch, Chap. Vtll.) 

Arrowroot, cornstarch, rice, etc., vnist not he ylven to 
infiints. 

Flot'r Ball. 

Put a Ixjwlful of floin- inU) a strong cloth, tie it up like 
a })U«lding, and place it in a kettle of boiling water. 
]i()il for 10 or 12 hours. When boiled turn it out of

tho amount for an older child. This n-ay ])e prepared i i 
the same manner as cornstaroli or ilour. The lonj>: l)()il- 
ing converts the starch into dextrine, which is more easily 
digested than starch. This is esjiecially valuahle in cases 
of diarrho'a, and may he used instead of barley gruel as 
a" food. 

Oatmkai, (JHI'KK. 

Pound a cupful of oatmeal in a pestle or on a bread 
l)oard. Put in a bowl and pour o\er it I pint of cold 
water. Stir it up, then let the mixture settle for a few 
minutes. Pour off the milky ihiid, repeat this process. 
Boil this water for an hour, ad<ling a pinch of salt, and 
US(^ it to dilute the milk instea«l of water. 

A thicker gruel may ])e made fi'oni oatmeal by allow- 
ing 1 tablespoonfui to a cup of boiling water. J^r't it

Alhi'minized Food.

an excellent sub.stitut<3. 

Shake the white of 1 egt^ with J a pint of water 
(filtered or boiled and cooled) in a ^lass jar until they 
are thoroughly mixed. Add a few grains of salt. 

Chihlren do not require a great variety in their food. 
Oive one article of diet at a time and see how it agrees 
before trying another. 

After a child is a year old the various cereals may be 
given as porridge instead of gruel, with the addition of a 
little sugar. 

Remember, all cereals should be thoroughly cooked 
(see page 88). 

Biscuits. 

Gluten, soda, oatmeal or Gntham biscuits may be 
soaked in milk or given alone. Do not give the fancy 
ur sweet biscuits to young children. 

E(J(js. 

A properly boiled egg (see page 69) may be given 
every altomate day to a child 1 year old. 

Junket. 

Junket is much better for young children than 
custards or puddings, and sometimes agi'ees well with 
babies. 

Take 1 pint of milk, heat it to 08" Fah., or milk warm. 
Add 1 teaspoouful of rennet and ]. teaspoonful of sugar.

Potatoes should not ])e ^dven to a child under 2 years 
old in any other form than baked. The potash salts are 
the most valuable constituent, and are lost when tlu^y 
are peeled and ])()ilt'd They should be dry and mealy. 
A little salt, butter or cream should be added.

Baked apples and tlie juice of an orange an; the oidy 
fruits which should be given to children under tw(j years

KicE. 

Rice is an excellent food for young children, but not 

for infants. 

Ventilation. 

Foul air is injuri(/us to grown persons, but it is in- 
finitely more dangerous to the sensitive organization of a 
child. Therefore special attention should be given to the 
ventilation of rooms occupied by a bal)y (see l)age 1 .*V2). 

Fresh air, wholesome food, regular bathing, and plenty 
or sleep will insure the normal growth of the aviu'age 
baby, and are within reach of every one who has the 
care of young children.

170 DOMESTIC SCIEXCIi. 

PLANNING AND SERVING MEALS. 

During tlie last quarter of scliool work each pupil 
should submit a typical menu for breakfast, dinner and 
supper, allo\vin<^ for a certain number of people. Consider 
the occupation, and give reasons for the choice of food for 
each meal. 

State how long it should take to prepare the meal, and 
give the cost. Insist upon variety in menus, and re(piest 
the pupil to describe how the meal shouM be served. 
System, neatness and promptness should be especially 
emphasized. Clean table linen — no matter how coarse — 
is possible for every oju;. A dish of fruit or flowers, if 
only a bunch of green foliage, improves the appearance 
of the table. 

During the scIkjoI course a special lesson should be 
devoted to setting the table and serving meals, witli and 
without a waitress, so as to give a knowledge of how a 
meal should be served, no matter what the pupil's posi- 
tion in life may be or what jmrt she may have to perform. 

A Few General Hints on Setting the Table. 

Although every housekeeper has her own method for 
serving meals, a few general principles govern all properly 
retrulated service. When settintj; the table, cover first 
with a canton-tlannel or felt cloth, in order to prevent 
noise and protect the table. Place each article in its pro- 
per place and not in a confused "jumble." See that the 
tablecloth is spread smoothly, that the corners are of 
eipial length, that the crease — if the cloth has been folded 
instead of rolled — is exactly in the centre. Place the 
fruit or flowers in the centre of the table. 



rLANNIN'G AND SERVING MEALS. 



171 



For each person place knife, sp(x)n and glass on the 
ri^^lit, foi'k and napkin on the left. Place the glass at the 
point of the knife. Turn the edge of the knife towards 
the plate and the fork tines up, the spoon with the 
bowl up. If soup is to be served, place a s(piare of bread 
or a roll on top of the napkin or between the folds. Place 
the pepper an<l salt at the corners of the table, unless 
individual i^alts are used, when they should be jjlaced at 
the head of the plates, where the dessert spoon may be 
placed — the handle towards the right — for convenience. 

The general rule in serving simple family meals, with 
or without a waitress, is for the hostess to serve the por- 
ridge and collee at breakfast ; the soup, salad and dessert 
at dinner, and pour the tea at the evening meal. When 
luncheon is served in the middle of the day tlie hostess 
usually does the greater part of the serving, as luncheon 
is considered to be the most informal meal of the dav. 



A Few Hints for Waitresses. 

Learn to move quickly and quietly. Be scrupulously 
clean and neat in every detail of dress and habit. Before 
servinor a meal see that hands and fin<xer nails are clean. 
Always have a fresh white apron ready to put on before 
the meal is announced. Look over the table and see that 
everything is in its place before announcing a meal. Fill 
the glasses with water either before the family enter the 
dining room or inunediately after they are seated. Lift 
the covers from hot dishes and turn them over at once in 
order to prevent the steam from dropping on the cloth. 
Take the plate from the host or hostess, and place before 
eav.h person from the right side — keep the thumb well 



172 



domkstk; sriKXOK. 



under tlie plato. Wlieii passing anytliing from wliich 
tlie persons S(iate(l at table lielp tlieinselves, such as 
ve<^etables, sauces, etc., always vro to the left, so as to 
leave the right liand of the one to be servinl free. Keep 
a watchful eye over the table and pass anything appar- 
ently required. 

Learn U) receive instructions from the; hostess in an 
undia'tone. Do not get excited and try to do too many 
things at once. It is an accomplishment to be a good 
waitress, as it re(|uires special reiinemciit and deftness, 
which are scarcely compatible with an unt'dy nature. 

When serving meals without a waitress, the daughters 
of the house should consider it their special privilege to 
save the mother any annoyance or discomfort during the 
meal time. Never allow dishes, which have been used, 
to accumulate on the table or allow the table to become 
disordered. As much of the food as possible should l)e 
placed on the table before the family are seated, and the 
plates or dishes removed at once after using. No matter 
how simple the meal may be, every housekeeper should 
see that it is served neatly and on time. Teachers may 
exercise a far-reachini; inthience in the refinin<f of home 
life by impressing upon the pupils the importance of 
these — too often considered — minor matters, and by 
}j:ivin<f minute instructions in the settine: of table and 
serving the meal. One carefully plainied ^^rac^ice lesson 
will convey more knowledge of such matters than any 
number of lectures or pages of theory.

Tlie following menus arid analyses are taken from 
bulletin No. 74, prcpai-ed in the United States Experi- 
ment Stations, and are inserted so as to give some idea 
of tlie cost and relative value of various foods in com- 
bination. It must be rpmcinhcrcd t}((it tJie 2)i'^('<'-'^ 0^^'^'^^

The more expensive m«'nus hav(! Ixm'ii omitted. The 
writer of the article sa}s : — 

"In plannnig a well balanced diet the following points 
must be considered : — 

(1) The use of any considerable amount of fat meat or 
starchy food should be otl'set l)y the use of some material 
rich in protein. Thus, if roast pork is to be eaten for 
dinner, veal, fish, or lean beef might well be eaten for 
])reakfast or supper, or both. Bean soup furnishes a con- 
siderable amount of protein, while bouillon, consomme, 
and tomato soup are practically useless as a source of 
nutriment. Skim milk also furnishes protein, with but 
very little accompanying fats and carbohydrates to 
increase the fuel value. 

(2) The use of lean meats or fish for all three meals 
would re([uire the use of such foods as rice, tapioca, or 
cornstarch pudding, considerable (juantities of sugar and 
butter, and more vegetables, in order to furnish sufficient 
fuel value. 

(8) Since flour, sugar, an<l l)utter or lard enter very 
largely into pastries and desserts, tlie larger the quan-

titles of tlioHo dislic's tliat <are coiiHiinicd tlio larger does 
tlie fuel value tend to become as compared with the 
protein. 

The principal classes of food materials may be roughly 
grouped as follows as regards the proportion of protein 
to fuel value, beginning with those which have the 
largest proportion of pi'otein and ending with those 
which contain little or no protein: — 

'Fish ; veal ; lean beef, such as shank, 
shoulder, canned corned, round, neck, 
and chuck ; skiui milk. 

'Fowl ; eggs ; mutton leg and shoulder ; beef, 
fatter cuts, such as rib, loin, rump, flank, 
and brisket ; whole milk ; beans and peas ; 
mutton chuck and loin ; cheese ; lean 
pork ; oatmeal and other breakfast foods ; 
flour ; bread, etc. 

Foods containing little or p^«ge tables and fruit ; fat pork ; rice ; tapi- 
no protein. | ^^^ i starch ; butter and other fats and 

I oils ; sugar, syrups. 



Foods containing a large 
amount of protein as 
compared with the fuel 
value. 



Foods containing a me 
dium amount of protein. 



The Menus. 

To illustrate the ways in which milk may be combined 
with other food materials, to form daily dietaries with 
about the amount of protein and the fuel value called 
for by the standard for men at moderate muscular work, 
a few menus are given in the following pages. These 
menus are intended to show how approximately the same 
nutritive value may be obtained by food combinations 
differing widely as regards the number, kind, and price of 
the food materials used to make up three daily meals. 
They also illustrate how the cost of the daily menu may

u may 



vary greatly with the kind and variety of materials pur- 
chased, though the nutritive value remains the same. 
These sample menus should not, however, be regarded as 
in any sense '* models " to be followed in actual practice. 
The daily menus for any family will necessarily vary 
with the market supply, the season, and the relative 
expensiveness of different food materials, as well as with 
the tastes and purse of the consumers. Tlie point to 
which we wish here to draw especial attention is that the 
prudent buyer of foods for family consumption can not 
afibrd to wholly neglect their nutritive value in making 
such purchases. 

With reference to the following daily menus, several 
points must be definitely borne in mind. (1) The 
amounts given represent about what would be called 
for in a family equivalent to four full-grown men at 
ordinary manual labor, such as machinists, carpenters, 
mill-workers, farmers, truckmen, etc., according to the 
usually accepted standards. Sedentary peoj^le would 
require somewhat less than the amounts here given. (2) 
Children as a rule may be considered as having " moder- 
ate muscular exercise," and it may easily be understood 
that the 14-year-old boy eats as much as his father who 
is engaged in business or professional occupation, both 
requiring, according to the tentative standard, 0.8 of the 
food needed by a man with moderate muscular work. 
(3) It is not assumed that any housewife will find it con- 
venient to follow exactly the proportions suggested in 
the menus. The purpose is to show her about what 
amounts and proportions of food materials would give 
the required nutrients. 

A family equivalent to four men having little muscu- 



176 



DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 



11 



lar o.\(!rcis(3 — i.e., men witli sedentary occupation — would 
re(|uire Imt about 0.«S the (piantities indicated in the fol- 
lowing^ menus. It would be very doubtful, however, if 
they would eat proportionally less of every food material. 
It would, in fact, be more probable that the amounts of 
meat, fish, eg^s, potatoes, and bread eaten would be 
reduced in a much greater proportion than fruit, pastry, 
cotl'ee, etc.

In tliese inemis the amount of milk lias, as a rule, been 
taken as representing somewhere near the average con- 
sumption. The amount of milk can be increased in any 
of the menus given above either by substituting it to 
some extent for coffee or tea, or by using more milk and 
smaller quantities of meats, butter or eggs. Roughly 
speaking, 1 quart of whole milk could be substituted for 
half a pound of meat or eggs and the amount of nutrients 
would be the same, while a pint of milk would give as 
large a fuel value as 1 J ounces of butter, and in addi- 
tion considerable protein not furnished by the latter. 

This replacement of meats by milk is illustrated in the 
following menu, in which a diet with a rather small 
quantity of milk is so changed as to include a much larger 
amount. Thus for breakfast in the modified ration a pint 
and a half of milk is made to take the place of half a 
pound of broiled steak. For dinner a quart of skim milk 
(or buttermilk) is called for, or a glass for each person 
unless some of it is used in the cooking. At the same 
time, 4 ounces less roast pork is required. In the same 
w^ay a glass of whole milk is allowed each person for 
supper, or the bread can be made into milk toast and the 
most of the extra milk used in this way. This allows the 
canned salmon to be reduced 6 ounces.

Menus VI and VII, following, are intended to illustrate 
how nourishing food can be procured in sufficient quan- 
tities and moderate variety at a cost of not over 16 cents 
per day. The cost to the farmer would be much less, 
since these menus call for considerable amounts of milk.

Which is Imrdly wortli more; than ouc-liult' or onr-thiiil 
as much on tho farm as it costs in tlie towns and cities. 
Cofi'uu lias not always been indicated, but can be intro- 
duced for any meal at a cost of from \ to 1\ cents per 
cup, accordin^^ to how much cofi'ee is used in making the 
infusion, and how^ much sugar, milk, and cream are added. 

It is, of course, not important that each meal, or the 
total food of each individual day, should have just the 
ri<^ht amount of nutrients, or that the ^proportions of 
protein and fuel int^redients should be exactly correct so 
as to make the meal or day's diet w^ell balanced. Thv, 
body is continually storin<( nutritive materials and usin<^ 
them. It is not dependent any day upon the food eaten 
that particular day. Hence an excess one day may b(j 
made up by a deficiency the next or vice versa. Healthful 
nourislnnent recjuires simply that the nutrients as a 
whole, durintr longer or shorter periods, should be fitted 
to the actual needs of the body for use.

Discussion of the Menus. 

These menus attempt to give, as nearly as convenient, 
the range of food materials and the variety of combina- 
tion which might be found in the average well-to-do 
household. Some of the menus are more varied and 
costly than others, and a few are given showing the 
effect of the use of more milk, and also how a diet might 
easily become one-sided. The quantities of the different 
foods used per meal will not, it is believed, be found out 
of proportion to each other, though of course they will 
not suit every family. The weights of all materials, oat- 



184 



DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 



meal aiul other cereals, meat, vegetables, etc., are for 
these substances as purchased. 

The calculation of the (luantities of nutrients con- 
tained in the diti'erent foods is based upon the average 
percentage composition of these materials. Inasmuch as 
the fats and carbohydrates are used simply as fuel they 
are not shown in the menus, only the quantity of protein 
and the fuel value of the food beiny: of interest. 

The cost of the diti'erent food materials must of neces- 
sity be more or less of a varying (juantity, depending 
upon the season of the year, the character of the markets, 
large or small, city or country, etc. Of the more import- 
ant food materials the assumed price per pound is as 
follows: l^eef loin, bS to 25 cents; shoulder, 12 cents; 
round, 14 cents; chicken, 15 cents; nuitton loin, 16 
cents; lamb leg, 20 cents; bacon, 16 cents; sausage, 10 
cents; milk, 8 cents (6 cents per quart); skim milk, 1 J, 
cents (8 cents per quart); butter, 32 cents; cheese, 1() 
cents: eggs, 1() cents (24 cents per dozen); flour and 
meal, 2 J to 8 cents ; cereals, 5 to 8 cents ; bread, 4 cents: 
potatoes and other vegetables, 1| cent (90 cents per 
bushel): bananas, about 8 cents (20 cents per dozen); 
oranges, about 7 cents (25 to 40 cents per dozen) ; apples, 
Ih cent pi'r pound (90 cents per bushel). 

It is pn)bable that the above figures represent more 
nearly the average prices of the difl'erent food materials 
in the eastern part of the covnitry than in the central 
and western j)ortions, where meats, cereals, and many 
otlier products are somewhat cheaper. It is also to be 
borne in mind that by observing the markets many food 
materials can be purchased much cheaper than here 



CONSIDERATION OF MENUS.

indicated, wliile on the other liand there may be times 
when they will be much mure exjiensive. The choice of 
vegetables and fruits will naturally be governed by their 
abundance and cost. 

Another point that must not be overlooked is that the 
quantities, an<l consequently the costs, here given are for 
four working men; that is to say, men engaged in 
moderately hard muscular labor. Of course, ditierent 
individuals ditt'er greatly in their needs for food. These 
figures express only general averages and are based upon 
the best information accessible. 



A Few Points to be Considered in Planning Meals. 

Dietetic authorities advise people who are engaged in 
activ^e muscular work to partake of the more substantial 
meal in the middle of the day, leaving such articles of 
food as soup — which is a valuable stimulant after a day 
of hard work — fruit, cake, etc., for the evening meal, 
when the system is too nuich exhausted to digest the 
more concentrated foods. When men are obliged to take 
cold lunches in the middle of the day the housewife 
should see that the lunch basket contains the necessary 
nourishment in the form of cheese, cold meat, meat or 
fish sandwiches, liard boiled eggs, a fish or vegetable 
salad, cold pork and beans, rice pudding, whole wheat 
bread and butter, a b(^ttle of milk or strained tea or 
coffee, pie, doughnuts, etc. 

Remember, a man working in the open air or in a large 
building recpiires food which will not oxidize too quickly, 
or in other words, food which will keep up the fuel and 
force necessary for his work. Supper in such cases 



186 



DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 



should consist of a good broth or well made soud, and 
the lighter foods ; but breakfast and dinner should be 
more substantial. It is a question of economy to provide 
suitable food for the wage-earner. The children may be 
equally well nourished on a less expensive diet, such as 
whole wheat bread and butter, milk puddings, fruit, 
green vegetables, cereals, milk, and meat once a day. 

On the other hand the individual engaged in sedentary 
employment, such as book-keeping, teaching, needlework, 
etc., should dine later in the day, as it leaves a longer 
interval for digestion, which is much slower when the 
individual is confined in a close office or work-room, and 
where little exercise is taken.* Care should be taken in 
planning meals for this class to avoid food which requires 
much oxygen, such as fresh pork, fried food, sausage, 
warm bread, pastry, griddle cakes, etc. The mid-day 
meal of a brain worker or business man should be light ; 
a soup, glass of milk (hot or cold), fruit, bread and butter, 
vegetable salad, a broiled chop or steak, etc., are suitable 
for luncheon. 

Special attention should be given to the diet of school 
children. (See p. 153.) 

Students and children who are obliged to study at 
night should, as a rule, take some light nourishment be- 
k)re retiring ; a biscuit, a piece of bread and butter, or a 
glass of hot milk, is sufficient. 

Young girls, who are employed in shops, factories, etc., 
frequently hurry away to their work in the morning 

* The teacher may make this clear by comparing the digestion of the 
two classes to the action of the air upon coal in a range with the drafts 
open and closed, the more rapid combustion, effect of oxygen, etc. 



CONSIDERATION^ OF MENUS. 



187 



without taking a substantial breakfast. It is needless to 
say that such action is sure to be followed by a physical 
breakdown. A glass of hot milk or an e^g beaten and 
added to a glass of milk will serve as an occasional sub- 
stitute for a more substantial meal, but is not enough to 
sustain active exercise for any length of time. 

Another point to consider in the planning of meals 
is economy of fuel. The thoughtful housekeeper will 
arrange to have food requiring long, slow cooking, such 
as stews, soup stock, bread, etc., and ironing done by the 
same fuel. Broiling, toasting, omelets, etc., require a 
quick fire. It is in the careful consideration of details 
that economy in both food and fuel may be exercised.

SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS. 

In giving instruction in Domestic Science, the teacher 
must be careful to explain the moaning of any words 
used wliich the pupils would not belikoly to understand ; 
for instance, oxidation, combustion, solubility, etc., and 
many of the terms used in the analysis, such as fermenta- 
tion, casein of milk, albumen, cellulose, etc. In order Uy 
keep the attention of pupils fixed on a subject, frecpient 
illustrations and comparisons should be made. 

Questioning is one of the best methods of riveting 
attention, and as every teacher has not the faculty of 
asking questions, a few suggestive ones are given which 
may prove helpful.

APPENDIX. 



Outlines Nos. 1 and II, for class work, are contrihuttMl by Prof. 
Kinne, of Teachers' College, Columbia University, N. V. City. 

Outline I. 

The following outline is offered as a tentative plan of 
work, for an average class of girls, in the highest grades 
of the Public school. The exact order of lessons depends 
in a measure on the skill and interest of the pupils, and 
the special dishes selected to illustrate a principle, upon 
the circumstances of the pupils, and upon the season of 
the year. 

It should be noted that beginning with the third 
lesson, there are four lessons on the cooking of cai*bo- 
hydrates ; then four on the cooking of nitrogenous foods; 
next the batters, combining the two, and introducing the 
use of fat, and so on. It is the purpose of this arrange- 
ment to enforce the effects produced by heat on the food 
principles, singly and in combination ; to alteniate the 
groups, so that there is a constant review of principles 
already established ; and to give practical w^ork of in- 
creasing difficulty. 

The course in cooking should be preceded by a few 
lessons in house- work ; and at least one on the care of 
the kitchen. It is taken for granted that the lessons are 
accompanied by a study of food values, the cost of food, 
marketing, etc. 

1. Simple experiments in combustion — to illustrate the 
structure of stoves and the care of such stoves. Study 



13

of the fuol and apparatus to be used in tlie scliool 
kitclien; practice in using tlie apparatus; comparison 
witli otlH.T apparatus. 

2. Utensils — wliat tliey are, of wliat materials, and 
wliy. It is well to have pupils make a list in note-book 
of simple; kitchen furnishing. 

Experiments with tlu; ])()ilin(r of water, in Florence 
flask, in tea-kettle, and in covered saucepan, using ther- 
mometer. Use of doubh; boiler. Compjire with boiling 
wattir the temperature of fat hot enough for frying, 
and also that of the oven. To illustrate the two latter, 
croutons may be mach;. 

8. Measuring — experiment with the cooking of starch 
in watei* ; cornstarch pudding, or tapioca or sago jelly. 
Develop the idea of the effect of the boiling temperature 
on the starch grains, the bursting of the grains, and the 
chan<i;e in Havor due to continued cookiniji;. 

4. A cereal and a fruit, — sa}'', baked apples. In the 
cereal, in addition to the starch, is the cooking of the 
woody fibre. Note in both cereal and fruit the flavors 
developed by heat, the cooking being a continuation, as 
it were, of the ripening process. 

5. A starchy and a green vegetable ; as, for instance, 
potatoes and cabbage. Here, again, are the two prin- 
ciples, cookiMy of starch an<l vegetable fibre; again the 
(level (jpment of flavor by heat. Cookery of peas and 
beans would better be deferred until the pupils are 
familiar with the effect of water on nitrogenous sub- 
stances. 

If time allows, a sauce may be made to serve with a 
vegetable, or this may be given in the next lesson.

pjii-t a review lesson. Opportunity is offered here l'(jr the 
study of proportions, several in«rredients bein*,' used, how 
much vetretahle pulp or juico to how much licjuid; how 
much thickenincr, and how much salt to a (juart of scjup. 

7. Egcrs. Experiments to show the coa(,mlatin(,^ point 
of the white and yolk, foll()W(id hy soft and hard cocjking 
of eggs, and possibly a plain omelet. 

8. Eggs and milk. 

9. Oysters. 

10. Fish. 

11, 12, 18. Batters. In these three lessons study 
especially proportions, methods of mixing and baking. 
A good sequence of batters is the following: popovers, 
griddle c^dves, muffins, and baking powder biscuit; or a 
sweet batter in the form of a plain cake may be given 
for sake of variety. 

Pan broiling and broiling.

preparation of simple meals. The plan can be followed 
in a longer course.

" I bave corne to the conclusion that more than hall the disease

as the laws of health must be recognized before they can be fully 
conformed to, the imparting of such knowledge must precede a 
more rational living."--Herbert Spencer.

PREFACE. 

N eminent authority * says : " Up to the age of sixteen 
even a lucid statement of principles is received by all 
but a few pupils as dogma. They do ,ot and cammt in any 
adequate sense realize the reasoning l,rocess by which scientific 
conclusions are reached. They are taught not only facts but 
classifications and laws, and causes in relation te» their effect. 
These are re»t, in the majority of cases, elaboratcd by the 
pupil. The teacbing of them accordingly dgenerates into a 
statement of facts, and the learning of them into an act of 
memory." 
To obviate this condition, or to at least neutralize ifs 
effects somewhat, is one of the principal reasons f,»r intro- 
ducing Domestic Science into the Public School curriculum ;  
science vhich relates so closely to the daily liïe tl,at it cannot 
be lcft fo an act of memory ; where cause and effect are so 
palpable that the pupil may reoeily arrive at an individual 
conclusion. 
The aim of this text-book is to assist the pupil in acquiring 
a knowledge of the fundamental principles of correct living, to 
co-ordinate the regular school studies so as to ,mke a practical 
use of knowledge already acquired. Arithmetic plays an

important part in the arranging of veights and measures, in 
the study of the analysis and relative value of various kinds 
of food, in estimating the cost of manufactured products in 
proportion to their market value, in the purehase of food 
material, etc. ttistory and geography are closely allied to the 
study of the diet ad eustoms of the differen countries, with 
their variety of climate and products. Physiology and tem- 
perance lrinciples permeate the vhole course of study. In 
addition to these are the direct lessons, provided by the 
practice work, in neatness, 10romptne and cleanliness. It 
vill therefore be necessary to have a vide general knowledge 
belote entering upon a course in Iomestic Seienee. 
Owing to the limited time allowed for this course in the

or fo write out the instructions carefully without infringing 
upon the tilne which should be devoted to practice work. 
order to meet this diflïculty, also to enable the pupil to work 
at home under the saine rules which govern the class work, 
simple recipes are given, beginning with a class requiring a 
knowledge of heat and its effect, going on to thoso requiring 
hand dexterity, belote attempting the more difficult subjects. 
After the pupils have acquired a knowle,lge of the "why and 
wheref,»re" of the different processes required in cooking, they 
will bave little difficulty in following the more elaborate 
recipes given in the nulnberless cook-books pr,»vided for house- 
hold use. Once the art--and it Ls a fine art--of cookery is 
mastered, it becomes hot only a pleasant occupation but 
provides excellent mental exercise, thereby preventing 
reaction which frequently follows school life. 

The tables given are to be used for reference, and hot tobe 
memorized by the pupil. 

The writer is greatly indebted to Prof. Atwater for his 
kindly interest and assistance in providing much valuable 
information, which in some instauces is given verbatim ; also 
to Dr. Gilman Thompson for Iermission to give extracts 
from his valuable book, "Practical Dietetics"; to 1)rof. 
Kinne, Columbia University (Domestic Science I)el0t.), for

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHER. 

Owing to the limitations of a text-book, it will be necessary for 
the teacher to enter very carefully into all the details of the v«trious 
questions; to explain the underlying principles so thor«»ughly 
that " the why and the wherefore" of every action in the prepar- 
ation of food will be clearly understood. She should endeav,,r to 
impress upon the pupfls thc value of thoroughly understanding the 
relation of food t,» the body. In practice lessons frequent refere»ce 
should be made to the analysis «,f the various fof,ds, as given in the 
tables and charts. 
The first practice lesson should be givcn on the making and care 
of a tire, regulating dampers, cleaning store, etc. The pupils 
should then be taught the naine and place of all the utensfls. 
Special attention should be given to the e.xp!anation of weights and 
measures ; the table of abbreviations should be memorized. Ar- 
range the class work so that each pupil may in alternation share the 
duties of both kitchen work and cooki,g. 
Personal cleanliness must be insisteà upon. Special attention 
should be given to the hands a-'d halls. The hair should be care- 
fully pinned back or confined in some way, and covcred by a cap. 
A large clcan apron and a holder should be worn whfle af work. 
Never al]ow the pupils to use a handkerchief or their aprons in 
place of a holàer. Untidy habits must not be allowed in the class- 
room. Set an example of perfect order and ncatncss, and insist 
upon pupils following that example. Teach thê pupils that cooking 
may be done without soiling either hands or clothes. The pupfls 
should do all the work of the clss-room, except scrubbing the

floor. Everything must be left in perfeet order at the close of eaeh 
le88on. 
Frequent reriews are absolutely neeessary. Urge the pupils go 
thiak f,,r themselves, and hot go rely upon the text-book. Where 
i,upils are baekward, or have hot had previous praetiee in kitehen 
work, give speeial attention to their manner of holding a knife or 
spoon in preparing articles f,r use, and in beating or stirring 
mixtures. Encourage deftness and light llandling of kitehcn ware. 
hmist upt,n promptness and keeping within the rime limit, b,,th in 
preparing the food and in the eooking. 
Owing to tire varicty of climate and markets, it would be impos- 
sible go arrange the lessons in the text-book in regular order. A 
few sample menus are given af the back of the book, but ench 
teaeher must be governed by circumstances in arranging the lessons 
for her elass. For instance, reeipes without eggs should be given 
in mid-winter, when eggs are dr. Fruits ard vegetbles must be 
given in season. 
The recipes given in the text-book are suitable for class work ; in 
some cases it nmy be necessary to divide them, as the quantities 
given are intended f,,r home i,ractice. The teacher should consider 
herself at liberty to substitute any recipe which she may consider 
valuable. The digestibility of food, the effect of stimulants-- 
especially of tea and coffee, the value of fresh air, etc., should be 
carefully impressed upon the pui,il. 
The teacher must keep the object of this instruction constantly 
beforc her: (1) to co-ordinate other school studies, such as arith- 
metic, history, geography, physiology ard temperance; (2) to 
develop the mental in conjunction with the manual powers of the 
children ; (3) to enable pupils to understand the reason for doing 
certain things in a certain way ; in other words, to work with an

intelligent conception «,f the value, both physically and hygienically, 
of knowing how the daily duties should be performed. 
In order that material may not be needlessly destroyed, each 
class of food should be introduced by an experimental lesson. For 
instance, before giving a lesson in the preparation «,f starches, each 
pupil should be given an opportunity to learn how t«» mix and stir 
the mixture over the tire, so as to prevent it from burning or 
becoming lumpy ; thia may be donc by using water and common 
laundry starch, or flour. The saine test applies to sauces, etc. A 
few cheap apples and potatoes may be used in learning to pare 
these articles. The effect «,f cold and hot water on albumen and 
tissues may be illustrated by the cheaper pieces of meat. 
Although the nmre scientific studies are gr.uped together, if 
does not follow that they are to be studied in the ,,rder given. 
The teacher must arrange her lessons--from the beginning--so as 
to include a certain amount «,f the theory with the practice work. 
Frequent reference should be ruade during practice lessons t,» the 
various chapters bearing more directly upon the science of cooking, 
so as to interest the pupil in the theoretical study of the food 
question. 
The teacher should insist upon the pupils taking careful notes 
while she is demonstrating a lesson, so that they may not Le 
entirely dependent upon the text-book, which from its limitations 
must simply serve as the key-note for further study. 
Special attention must be given to the chapter on "Digestion," 
page 58, in the Public School Physiology. This chapter should be 
studied--especially pages 71-75--in conjunction with "Food 
Cla.ssifications" (Chap. 2) ; also in dealing with the digestibility of 
starches, etc.

CHAPTER I. 

The Reletion of Food fo the Body. 
In order to un,l,.rstand the r«.lation of 5,od to the 
sustenance and reI,airing of thc body, it will be neces- 
sary fo learn, first, of what t],e l»dy is composed, a,,d 
the corresponding elements contain,:d in the food required 
fo build and keep the body in a healthy condition. Thc 
following tuble gives the api,roxin,ate analysis of a man 
weighing 148 potmds :-- 
Oxygen ........................... 92.1 pounds. 
Hydrogeu .................. 14.6 ,, 
Carbon .................... 3 l. (; ,, 
N itrogn ............... 4.6 ,, 
Phosphorus ...... 1.4 ,, 
Calcium ....... -°.S ,, 
Sull,hur ....................... 0.24 ,, 
Chlorine ........................... 0.12 ,, 
Sodium ............................. 0.12 ,, 
lron .............................. 0.02 ,, 
Potassium ....................... 0..)4 ,, 
Magnesium ...................... 0.04 ,, 
Silica ......................... ç ,, 
Fluorine ............................ 0.02 ,, 
Total ...................... 148.00 poun,l.. 
As food contai,s all these elements, and as there is col,- 
stant wearing and repair going on in the body, it will be 
readily seen how necêssary some knowledge of the rela- 
tion of food to thc body is, in order to prcsêrvc health. 
1 



P. DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

Hydrogen and oxygen combined form water, hence we 
find from the above calculation that about three-fifths of 
the body is composed of water. Carbon is a solid: 
dialnonds are nearly pure carbon ; "lead" of lead pencils, 
anthracite coal and coke are impure forms of carbon. 
Carbon combined with other elements in the body 
makes about one-fifth of the whole weight. Carbon 
with oxygen will burn. In this way the carbon taken 
into the body as food, when combined with the oxygen 
of the inhaled air, yields heat to keep the bo]y warm, 
and force--muscular strength--for work. The carbonic 
acid (or carbon dioxide) is ven out through the lungs 
and skin. In the further study of carbonaceous foods, 
their relation to the body as fuel will be more cleady 
understood, as carbon is the most important fuel element. 
Phosphorus is a solid. According to the table, about one 
pound six ounces wouhl be found in a body weighing 
148 pounds. United with oxygen, phosphorus forms 
what is known as phosphoric acid; this, with lime, makes 
phosphate of lime, in which form it is found in the bones 
and teeth ; if is round also in tbe brain and nerves, flesh 
and blood. Hydrogen is a gas, and like carbon unites 
with the oxygen of the inhaled air in the body, thus 
serving as fuel. The water lroduced is given off in 
the respiration through the luns and as perspiration 
through the skin.* Calcium is a metal. The table given 
allows three pounds of calcium ; united with oxygen, 
calcium fOl'lnS lime. This with phosphoric acid Inakes 
phosphate of lime, the basis of the bones and teeth, in 
which nearly ail the calcium of tbe body is found. 

"An illustration of vapor rising ma)- be given by breathing upon a mirror. 



TttE RELATION OF FOOD. 

The elements which bear no direct relatioa tu the 
force production of the body, but xvhich enter into tissue 
formation, are chlorine, sulphur, iron, sodium, potassium, 
phosphorus, calcium and magnesium. Bone tissue con- 
tains about 50 per cent. of line phosphate, hence the 
need of this substance in the food of a growing infant, 
in order that the bones may become firm and strong. 
Lack of iron salts in the food impoverishes the coloring 
matter of the red blood corpuscles on which they depend 
for their power of carrying oxygen tu the tissues; 
anoemia and other disordcrs of deficient oxidation result. 
The lack of sufficient potash salts is a factor in pro, hcing 
scurvy, a condition aggrgvated by the u,e of comnton 
salt. A diet of salt meat and starches may cause it, with 
absence of frcsh fruit and vegetables. Such illustrations 
show the need of a well-balanced diet. 
In order tu undcrstand the value of the various classes 
of food and their relation tu the body as force producers, 
tissue builders, etc., the folloxving table may prove 
he]pful :

Fin,ling tha out food and our bodies eonain essen- 
tially the saine elements, we must also bear in mind that 
the body eannoç ereate anything for itself, neither 
material nor energy ; all mus be supplied by the fo,,,l we 
eaU, which is transformed into repair matcl'ial for the 
body. Thorofore, the objeeç of , course of study dcaling 
with the science of this question, as i relates to the daily 
lire, should be to learn SOlaethilg of how food builds he 
body, repairs the wa.ste, yields ]mat and energy, and to 
teaeh le principles «,f food eeonomy in its relation fo 
health and incolne. This, with the develoi,men of ex- 
ecutive ability, is all that tan 1»«. attempt«.d in a primary 
course. 



CHAPTER IL 

Food Classification. 

The followiug are familiar exalnples of compounds of 
each of the fuur principal classes of nutrients: 
'Albuminoids, e.g., albumen of eggs ; myosin, the 
basis of muscle (lean meat); the albuminoids 
which make up the gluten of wheat, etc. 
Proteids. Gehttinoids, constituents of connective tissue which 
yield gelatin and allied substances, e.g., coilagen 
of tendon ; ossein of bone. 
"Nitrogenous extractives" of flesh, i.e., of meats and fish. 
PROT]IN.- These include kreatin and allied compounds, and are the 
chier ingredients of beef tea and most meat extracts. 
Amids: this terre is frequently applied to the nitrogenous 
non-albuminoid compounds of vegetable foods and feeding 
stuffs, among which are amido acids, such as aspartic acid 
and asparagin. Some of them are more or less allied in 
chemical constitution to the nitrogenous extractives of 
flesh. 
I Fat of meat ; fat of milk ; oil of corn, wheat, etc. The in- 
gredJents of the "ether extract" of animal and vegetable 
Fats . .. foods and feeding stuffs, which it is customary to group 
I together roughly as fats, include, with the true fats, 
various other substances, as lecithians, and chlorophylls. 
Carbohydrates, sugars, starches, celluloses, gums, woody fibre, etc. 
Miter«tl [Potassium, sodium, caleium and magnesium chlorids, sul- 
tatter. ( phares and phosphats. (Atwat¢r). 
The terres (a) " nitrogenous" and (b) " carbonaceous " 
are frequently used to designate the two distinct classes 
of food, riz.: (a) the tissue builders and flesh formers; 
(b) fuel and force producers. 
6 



WTE. 7 

Each of these classes contains food material derived 
from both the animal and vegetable kingdom, although 
the majorty of the animal substances belong to the 
nitrogenous, and the majority of the vegetable substances 
to the carbonaceous group. 
Therefore, for practical purposes, we will confine our- 
selves to the more gencral terres used in Atwater's table. 

Uses of :Food. 
First, food is use,1 to form the materia]s of the body 
and repair its waste ; second, to yiehl ener in the form 
of (1) heat fo keep the body warm, (2) to provide mus- 
cular and other power for the work it has to do. In 
forming the tissues and fluids of the body the f,o,l serves 
f,r building and repair. In yelding energy, it serres as 
fuel for heat and power. The principal tissue formera 
are the albuminoids; these form the frame-work of the 
body. They build and repair the nitrogenous materials, 
 those of muscle, tendon and bone, and supply the 
albuminoi,ls of blood, milk and other fluids. The chief 
fuel ingTedients of food are the carbohydrates an,l fat 
These are either consumed in the bo, ly or are stored as 
fat to be used a occasion dcmands. 

Water. 

By referring to a preceding chapter we find that water 
composes three-fifths of the entire body. The e]asticity 
of muscles, cartilage, tendons, and even of bones is due 
in grcat part fo the watcr which these tissues contain. 
The amount of water required by  healthy man in 
twenty-four hours (children in proportion) is on the

average between 50 and 60 ounces, beside about 25 
ounces taken as an ingmdiont of solid food, thus nmking 
a total of from 75 to 85 ounces. One of the most uni- 
versal ,liet«.tic fai]ings is neglect fo take enough water 
into the system. Dr. Gilman Th«,mi)son gives the fol- 
lowing uses of wacr in the 1)ody : 
(1) Ig enters into the ehemieal composition of 
tissues ; (2) if forms tle ehi,f ingq'edi«,nç of all the fluids 
of the bo,ly and maintains çheir proper degee of dilu- 
tion ; (3) by moisçening vmqous sm'faees of çhe body, sueh 
as the IllUCOUS and serous m/.mbmes, if 1,revents friction 
and the uncomfortable symptoms which might rcsult 
from d3-in" ; (4) it fm'nishes in the blood and lymph a 
tluid me,lium by which food may be takcn to remotc 
parts of the body and the waste marrer removed, thus 
promoting rapid tissue changes; (5) if serres as a 
,listributer of bo, lr h,.at; (6) if regulatcs the body 
cmp«.raturc l,y the physical l»roc«-ss«.s of als«wption 
and evaporati«,n. 

Salts (Mineral Natter).- Use of Salts in Food. 

(1) To regulate the specific gravity of the blood and 
other fluids of the body ; (2) fo preserve the tissues from 
«lisorganization and putrefaetion; (3) to enter into the

CHAPTER III. 

Nutrition. 

It is not within the scope of this book to deal with 
the science of nutrition; but a f,.w general principles 
may be given vhich c,»ncern the eflbct upon the syste, 
of the diflrent classes of food. Animal food requires 
a considcrable quantity of oxygen for its complete 
colnbustion. Meat in gcneral has a more stimulating 
effect upon the systeln and is more strengthening than 
vegetable food. There is, however, a tendency fo eat 
too much meat, and when its effects are not counter- 
balanced by free outdoor exercise, it causes biliousness 
and sometimes gout and other troubles. Albuminous 
f«×ds can l»e eaten longer alone without exciting loath- 
ing than can rats, sugars or starchea A carbonaccous 
dict taxes the excrctory organs less than animal food. 
Mcat is hot necessary to lire. :Nitrogenous food man 
must have, but it need not be in the form of meat. 
The estimate commonly given is, that meat should 
occupy one-fourth and vegetable food three-fourths of 
a mixed diet, but in many cases the mcat eaten is 
much in excess of this allowance. The proper associa- 
tion of different foods always keeps healthy people 
in better condition; thcre are flirtes, however, when it 
l,,ay be necessary to abstain from certain articles of 
diet. It may be well to bear in mind, that the protein 
compounds can do the work of the carbohydrates and 
fats in bcing consumed for fuel, but the carbohydrates 
and iats cannot do the work of lrotein in building and

repalrlng the tissues of the body. As already stated, 
 mixed diet is the only rational one for man. An 
exclusively vegetable dit, while if may maintain  con- 
dition of helth for a time, eventually results in  loss 
of strength and power fo resist discase. Tl,rcfore if is 
necessary to undcrstand tlm approxim«tte value of each 
class of food in rranging the daily dietary. 



CHAPTER IV. 

Food and Economy. 

It bas been stated that "a quart of milk, three-quarters 
of a pound of mo, lcrately lean becf, and rive ounces of 
wheat fl, mr contaiu al»out the saine amount of nutritive 
matel'ial ;" but we 1,ay ,liflrcnt prices for them, an,1 they 
bave diflbrcnt vahms for nutrilnent. The milk cornes 
ncarest to being a l»a'fect food. It contaius ail the dif- 
forent kin,ls of nutritive materials that the body requires. 
Brea,1 ruade froln wheat flore" will support lire. It 
contains all the necessary ingredients for noulshment, 
but hot in the proportion best adapte,l for or, lilmry use. 
A man lnight ]ive on beef aloue, but it would be a very 
Olm-sidcd and imrfect diet. Meat and bread togethcr 
lnake the essentials of a healthful ,lier. In order fo give 
a general idca of food CCOlmmy, it will be necessary fo 
deal briefly with the functious of the various food 
prilmiplcs. As our bodies contain  great deal of muscle, 
the waste of which is repaired by protein found in such 
food as lean meat, eggs, eheese, beans, peas, oatmeal, fish, 
etc., a supply of these articles lnUSt be eonsidered in 
purchasing the daily supp]y. Fatty tissue (hot muscle) 
serves as fuel, therefore the value of sueh foods as butter, 
erealn, oils, etc., is apparent. Carbohydrates tbrm fat and 
serve as lu,.1 and fome produeers; these eome in the fo 
of starehes, sugars,vegetables and grains being the moet 
important. "In heing themselves burued to yield energy, 
the mtents proteet eaeh other froln being eonsumed. 
The pl'otein and fats of body tissue are used like those

of foods. Au in,portant use of thc earbohy, lrates and 
fts is fo protect protcin (muscle, etc.) from consumption. 
"The ,ost healthful food is that which is best fifted fo 
the wauts of the user: the cheapest food is fhat whicb 
furnishes the largest amouut of nutriment at the least 
cost: the best food is that which is both healthful 
cheap." ]y referring fo the various charts a fait 
estimate of f,od values nay be obtaincd. 
As will be noticed, the animal foods conta]u the most 
- I)roteiu and rats, while the veget«b]e foods are rich i 
carbohydrates. A pound of cheese may have 0.2 
pound of protein, as much as  nmn af ordinary work 
needs for a day's susteuance, while  pound of mi|k 
would have only 0.04, and a pound of potatoes 0.02 
pound of pro/ein. The nmterials which have the most 
fats and carb¢hydrut,.s have the highest fuel value. 
The fuel wdue of a 1,oun,l of fat pork ,my reach 2.995 
calories, while that of , pound of sait codfish woul,1 be 
only .315 calories. On the otler hand, the nutritive 
matcrial of the codfish wouhl consist almost entirely of 
protein, while the pork contains very little. Amont tbe 
vegetable foods, peas and beans bave a high proportion 
of proteiu. Oatmeal contains a large l»r[portion a]so. 
Potatoes are low lu fuel value as we]l as in protein, 
because they are three-fourths water. For /he saine 
reaon nfilk, which is scven-eights water, ranks low 
respect fo both protein and fuel value, hence the rcason 
why it is hot so valuable as food for an adult as many 
of the other food materials. 
These few illustrations will he]p to show the need of 
an intelligent ide of food values before attempt]ng fo 
purchase the sui)plies for family use. As one-half a

Quantity of Food Required. 

The quantity of food re, luired fo maintain the body in 
 vigorous condition depends upon the following condi- 
tions :---(1) Climate and season, (2) clothing, (3) occupa- 
tion, (4) age and sex. In civilized countries more food is 
eaten, as a rulc, than is necessa T to maintain hcalth and 
strength. Clinmte and seasons influence the quantity of 
food eaten. A cold, bracing atmosphere stimulates the 
appetite, tempts one fo exercise, while a, hot climate bas 
the contrary effêct ; hence the need for more or less food. 
Abundant clothing in cold weather conserves the body 
heat; less food is therefore required fo maintain life. 
Exercise and nuscular work cause 'eater oxidation in 
the tissues and greater waste of the muscles; this must 
be replaced by proper food. Outdoor work requires 
more food than indoor, and physical labor more than 



QUANTITY OF FOOD t{EQUIRED. 15 

mental. It has been estimated "that a child of ten years 
requires hall as much f(»od as a growu woman, and one 
of fourteen n equal mnount. The rapidly growing 
active boy often eats as much as a ,mn, and the middle- 
aged man requires more than the age«:[ A man of 
seventy years may preserve l,calth on a quantity which 
would soon starve his grandson." 
Just what inredients of the food serve for nourish- 
ment of the brain nd nerves, and how they do that 
service, are mystees wl,]ch have hot yct been solve,1. 
Brain and nerve contain the elcments nitrogen and 
i)hosphorus, which are f,»un«l in protein compounds but 
hot iu the true fts, sugars, aml starches, which contain 
only carbon, hy, lroEen and oxygen. We nafurally infer 
that the protcin compounds ,ust be esi»cially concerned 
in building up brain and nerve, and kçeping them in 
repair. Just how much food the brain worker needs is 
a question which has n«gt yet becn decided. In general it 
appea that a man or a w(»man whose occupati(»n is 
whaç we call sedenta'y, who is without vigorous exercise 
and does but little hard muscular work, needs much lcss 
than the man af hard manual labor, and that the brain 
workcr needs comparativel)" little of carbohydrates or 
fats. Many physicians, physiologists and students of 
hygiene have become convinced that well-to-do p..oplc, 
whose work is mental rather than physical, eat too much ; 
that the diet of 10eople of this class as a whole is 
sided as well as excessive, and tha the pncipal evil is 
the use of too much fat, starch and sugar. If is wt, ll to 
remember that if is the quantity of food digested which 
builds the body, and ,mre injury is likely fo rcsflt fr,)m 
over-eating than from a restricted diet, hence the value

Quality of Food. 

If is a great mistake tn think tha the best is the 
chcapest in regard fo the food question, that the higher 
price,l mcats, fish, butter, etc., omtain special virtues 
lacking in the cheaper articles. 1-'oor cooki-ng is tle clief 
ca:.«'e qf t] is e'rrac in judgmet. No doubç a well broiled 
steak is more appetizing and delicate in flavor than some 
of the cheaI«'r cuts, but in propooEion fo the cost is hot 
eqnal in nutritive value; careful cooking and judicious 
flavoring rcnder the cheaper pieces of beef equally palat- 
al,le. That expensive food is hot nccessary to maintain 
lire has been clearly demonstrated by the traditional diet 
of the Scotch people with their oatmeal and hem'ing ; the 
Irish, potatoes aud buttermi|k; N'ew England, codfish and 
potatoes, an,1 pork and beans ; the Chinese, rice, etc. 
notony of diet, hovever, is no$ recommended, for reasons

given in a previous chapter, and lu the countries where a 
special diet prevails owing fo the climate, nature of soli 
and markets, the results bave hot warranted us in be- 
lieving that if is as good as s mixed diet. From this 
necessarily brief outline of the food question we have 
learned (1) thaç u knowledge of the requirements of tle 
body are absolutely necessary in r,.gulating a proper 
diet; (2) fo furnish the food principles in a cheap rather 
than a dear form; (3) fo un,|e'stand the art of cookery 
so as fo secure the full nutritive value and af the saine 
rime stimulate the ai)petite; (4) the value of economy in 
regard fo food i)riucii)les. When the housekeeper bas 
acquired this knowledge she will lave covcred tle ficld 
of food economy. Prof. Atwater says : "When we know 
whaç are the kinds ami an,ount of nutritive substances 
our ho,lies need and our food materials contain, then and 
hOt till then shall we le able to adjust out diet to the 
demands of health and i»urse." 

Cooking of Food. 
If is sometimes asked, why do we cook our food ? 
many opi)ortunities vill occur during this course of in- 
struction for a comi)arison of the customs and d«-t of 
the various countris, and the advance of ci'iliTation 
this direction, we will confine ourselves fo the dcfinition 
of the terre as if concerns ourselves. 
5If. Atkinson says, that "Cooking is the right appli- 
cation of heat for the conversion of food material." 
As much of our ïood requires cooking, how we shall 
cook if so as fo ren«ler if more palatable, more digestble, 
and with the greatst cconomy of rime, fuel and moncy,

is an object deserving the most careful attention. The 
art of cooking lies in the llower fo develoll certain 
flavors -«'hieh are agreeable to the I,alate, or in other 
words, vhich "make the l,outh water," without inter- 
fering with the nutritive «lualities of the food llrepared, 
fo understan,l by "xhat metlo,1 certain foods may bc 
rendered more digestible, and o provide variety. 
notony of diet and of flav«,r lessens the appetite and 
fails to stinmlate the digestive orgaus. 
The ehelnical chanes, produced by cooking food pro- 
perly, aid digestion, beside destroyi,g any gel'mS which 
may be contained in the food. 1X'eal'ly ail foods--excellt 
fruit--require cooking. The digestibility of starch dt- 
llen,ls ailnost entirely upon the manner in which if is 
cooked, esllecially the cereal class. Gastric troubles are 
sure fo follow the use of imllroperly coked grains or 
starches. (See Chall. VII.) 
Methods. 
The following are the u.ual methods observed 
in cooking, viz.: ç l boiling, (2) stewiig, (3) 
r,»asting, (4) broiling, (5) frying, (6) braising, (ï) 
baking, (,) steaming. 
Water boils at a telnperature of 212° F. 
,";immering shou.ld be af a temperature of from 
175" F. to 180 F. When ,xater bas reaehed the 
boiling i«ñnt, its tempêratul'e cannot be rai.ed, 
but will be con',:rte«l into steam; henee the folly 
of adding fuel fo the tire when water has already 
reached the boiling lloint. 
Stewing allows the .iuices of the lnea.t fo 
beconle dissolved in water heatcd to the silnmer-

ing ])oint. The juiees thus dissolved are eaten 
with the meat. If hotinjured by the addition 
,,f rich sauces or fats, this is usu«dly a v:ry 
,ligestible method «,f preparing certain kin,ls of 
Broiling is cooking directly over the hot coa]s. ,,. 
A coating of coagulated albumen is formed upon 
the outer surface. çhis coating prevents the 
evuporation of the juices, which with the extruc- 
tire mtefiMs are retained and improve the 
flavor. Meat cooked in this way has a decide,1 
advuntage, in both flavor and nutritive value, 
over that which has been boiled or stcwed. 
There are, however, on]y certain kinds of meat 
that are suitable f,,r broiling. 
Fing is cooking in hot fat. The boilingvawu. 
point of fat is far above that of water. Fat 
should hot  heuted above 400  F.,  if will 
then turn dark and emit a disagreeab]e odor. 
Ffied foed, unless ve carefully ppared, is con- 
sidered unwholesome. The on]y proper method 
for frng is te» immer the food completely in a 
bath of hot fut. 
Braising is cooking meat in a covercd vcssel m«,s. 
suounded by  solution of vegetable and animal 
juices in a strong but hot boiling mperaturc. 
Tough meat muy be rended very palatable and 
nutritious by cooking in this way. The cover of 
the pan or kettle must fit closely enough fo pre- 
vent evaporatio It requires long, steady cook-

meat in either ]lot fat or in a very hot oven 
before braising. 
Baking is cooking in confined h,:at. Meat 
properly co,,ked in an oven is consid,.red by 
many authorities as quite equal in delieaey of 
flavor to that rc»asted before a tire, and is equally 
digestible. 
Steaming is eooking food over eondonsed 
steam, and is an excellent method for preparing 
f,»d whieh requires long, slow eooking. Pud- 
dings, eereals, and other glutinous mixtures are 
often eooked in this way. It is an eeonomieal 
method, and ]las the advantage of developing 
flavor without loss of substance. 

Food Preservation. 
Food is preserved by the following processes: 
(1) drying, (2) smoking, (3) salting, (4) fr,.ezing, 
(5) refrigerating, (6) sealing, (7) addition of anti- 
s;ptic and preservative substancea 
Drying in the sun and before a tire is the 
usual method employed by hou.ekeepers. Fruits 
and vegetables, meat and fish may be preserved 
by drying, the latter with the addition of salt. 
Smoking is chiefly applied fo beef, tongue, 
bacon, haro, and fish, which are hnng in a con- 
fined chamber, saturated with wood smoke for a 
long rime until they absorb tf certain percentage 
of antiseptic nmterial, which prevents the fat 
from becoming rancid, and the albumen from 
putrefying. Wcll smoked bacon cut thin and

properly cooked is a digestible form of fatty 
food, espeeilly f(gr tubercular patients. Smok- 
ing improves the digestibility of haro. 
Salting is one of the oldest methods of pre-sALTIN 
sela-ing food. The addition of a little saltwtre 
helps to preserve Oie color of the meat. ]rine 
is frequently used fo temporarily preserve nJeat 
and other substances. Corned beef is a poI)ular 
form of salt preservation. Ail salted meats 
«luire long, slow cooking. Th«.y shou]d always 
be placcd in cold water and heated gr«ulually in 
. o,'der fo extract the sait. Salt m,'ats are less 
digestible and hot quite so nutritious as fresh 
meats. 
Food may be kept in a frozen condition ahnost FREEZI-6. 
indefinitely, but will deeonTose very quiekly 
when thawed, henee the necessity for eooking 
immediately. Frozen meat loses 10 per cent. of 
its nutritive value in eooking. 
This proeess does hot involve aetual freezing, 
but implies preservation in chambers af a tem-TI.-. 
peratm maintained a few de'ees above freezing 
i,oint. This method does hot affeet the flavor or 
nutritive value of food so nmeh as freezing. 
Sealing is aecomplished not only in the proeess 
of eanning but by eovering with substances 
whleh are impermeable. Beef has been pre- 
ser'ed for eonsiderable time by immer.ing 
hot fat in whieh if was allowed fo remain after 
eooling. 
Chemieals are sometimes used in the preserva- 
tion of food, but the other methods are saler, cs. 



CHAPTER V. 

Foods Containing Protein, or litrogenous 
Matter. 

MEAT. 

Animal foods eontain nutritive marrer in a 
eoncentrated form, and being ehemically similar 
to the composition of the body is doubtless the 
reason why they assimilate more readily than 
vegetable foo,]s, although the latter are richer in 
mineral matter. The most wfluable animal foods 
in conm,m use are nleat, eggs, milk, fish, gelatin 
and fats. 
M,:at is composed of muscular tissue, connec- 
tive tissue or oxistle, fatty tissue, blood-vessels, 
nerves, bone, etc. The value of meat as food is 
due chiefly to the nitrogenous compound if con- 
tains, the most valuable being the albuminoids: 
the gelatinoid of meat is easily changed into 
gelatin by the action of hot water. Gelatin 
when combined with the albuminoids and ex- 
tractives has considerable nutritive value. Ex- 
tractives are meat bases, or rather meat which 
has been dissolved by water, such as soup stock 
and beef tea. The object in cooking lneat is to 
soften and loosen the tissue, which reders it more 
easily digeste& Another object is fo sterilize or 
kill any germs which may exist and fo make if 
more palatable. The digestibility of meat is 
influenced by the age of the animal kille, l and 
the feeding. The following table is given as an 
average of the digestibility of animal foods :--

In boiling meat two principles must be con-

of the juices. If the meat alone is tobe used it 
should be placed in suflàcient boiling water to 
completely cover, and kept st boiling point 
(212 ° F.) for a,t least ten minutes, so ms tre harden 
the albumen and prevent the eseape of the juices. 
The temperature should then be allowed fo fall 
fo silnmering poing (175 ° F.). If the water is 
kept boiling if will tender the meat touffh and 
ch T. If the juice is to be extracted and the 
bl'oth used, the meat shoul,1 be placed in cold 
watcr; if boncs are ad,led they should be eut or 
broken into small pieces in order that the gela- 
tin may be dissolved. If the water is heated 
gradually the sohlble materials are more e«tsily 
dissolved. The albumen will fise as a scum fo 
the top, but should hot be skinlmed off, as if 
contains the nlost nutriment and will settle fo 
the bottom as sediment. 
If both nlcat and broth are fo be used the 
proeess of cooking should be quite different. In 
stewing, the meat should be eut into small pieces, 
put into cold water in order that the juices, 
flavoril,g Inateril and fibre may be dissolved. 
The temperture should be gradually raised to 
simmering point and renmin st that heat for 
at least three or four hom's, the vessel being kept 
elosely covered. Cooked in this way the broth 
will be rich, and the meat tender and juicy. Any 
suitable flavoring may be dded. This is a good 
luethod for cooking ment containing gristle. 
When the meat alone is go be eaten, êithêr 
roasting, broiling or frying in deep fat is  more

economical method, as the juices are saved. The 
shrinkage in a roast of meat during cooking is 
chiefly due to a loss of wat,.r. A sm«dl toast will 
require a hotter tire than a larger one, in ord_.r 
to harden the exterior and prevent the juices 
from escaping. Meat is a poor con,luctor of 
heat, conse,tuently a large roast exposed to thi. 
intense heat would become burne,l before the 
interior could be heate& The large roast .houl,| 
be exposed fo intense heat for a fev minutes, but 
the temperature should then be reduced, and long 
steady cooking allowed. 
Broiling (see broiling in previous chai,ter, p. 1 .q.) 

Varieties of Meat. 
Beef tongue is a tender form of meat, 
contains too nmch fat fo agree well with people °GU' 
of dclicate digestion. 
Veal, when obtained from animals kille, l too 
young, is apt to be tough, pale and indigestible, 
but good veal is considered fairly nutriti,ms. It 
contains more gelatin than beef, anti in broth 
considered valuable, especially for the sick.

Pork is  ten,lcr-fibred meat, but is very indi-

pcrcentage of albuminoids:--Red snapper, white- 
fish, brook trout, sahnon, bluefish, shad, eels, 
mackerel, halibut, haddock, lake trout, bass, cod 
aud flounder. The old theory that fish consti- 
tuted "brain food," on account of the phosphorus 
if contained, has proved tobe entircly without 
foundation, as in reality many fish contain 1,.ss 
of this element than meat. The tribes wlfich live 
largely on fish are hot noted for intellectuality. 
Fish having white meat when broilcd or boiled--

people of weak digestion. Fish should be well 
cooked. 
Oysters are a nutritious food, and may beo'sES.

Adults who are able to eat any kind of food are

CHAPTER VI. 

Fats and Oils. 
Fats and oils contain three elements---earbon, 
oxygen and hydrogen. About one-fifth of the 
body is eomposêd of fat. I3efore death results 
from starvation 90 per eenç. of the body faç is 
COllSUIlled. 
(1  To furnish energy for the developmcnt of 
heat; (2) fo supply force; (3) fo serve as cover- 
ing and protection in the body; (4) fo lubricate 
the various structures of the body; and (5) fo 
spare the tissues. The rats and oils used as food 
ail serve the saine purpose, and corne 1le-fore the 
carbohydrates in fuel and force value ; in comt)in- 
ation with proteids, they form valuable foods 
for those engaged in severe muscu]ar exercise, 
such as army marching, miningexpcditious, etc. 
Fats and oils are but little changed during 
digestion. The fat is divided into little globules 
by the action of the pancreatic juice and other 
digestive elements, and is absorbed by the systcm. 
Fa.t forms the chier material in adipose tissue, a 
fatty layer lying bcneath the skin, which keeps 
the warmth in the body, and is re-asorl)e,1 into 
the blood, keeping up hea.t and uctivity, und pre- 
serving other tissues during abstincnce from 
food. Fat somctimes aids the digestion of 
starchy foods by preventing them from forming

lumpy masses in the mouth and stomach, hence 
the value of using butter with bread, potatoes, 
etc. The niml fat.s are more nutritive than 
the vegetble, butter and cream heading the list. 
Cooking rats st a very high temperature, sueh as 
frying, causes  reaetion or deeomposition, whieh 
irritates the mucous membrane and interferes 
with digestion. 
The principal animal fats are butter, cream, 
lard, suet, the fat of mutton, pork, bacon, bef, 
fish and cod livêr oil. The vegetable fats and 
oils chiefly used as food are derived from seeds, 
olives, and nutK The most important rats and 
oils for household purposes are: 
Butter, which contains from 5 fo l0 per cent. mrrrE. 
of water, 1 1.7 per cent. fat, 0.5 per cent. casein, 
0.5 per cent. milk sugar (Konig). The addition 
of salt fo butter prevents fermentation. Butter 
will not support life when taken alone, but with 
other foods is highly nutritious and digestible. 
Cream is one of the most wholesome 
agreeable forms of fat. It is an excellent substi- 
tute for cod liver off in tubercu|osis. Ice cream

Carbohydrate Foods. 

The idea of starchy foo, ls is usually connected 
with such substances as buwlry starch, corn- 
starch, arrow roof, etc. Thse are, of course, 
more concentrated forms of stu'ch than pot- 
toes, rite, etc. Many starchy foods contain (_,tlwr 
ingredients, «tnd some are especially rich in 
proteids.

:If is estimated that starch composes one-half 
of peas, beans, wheat, oats and rye, three-fourths 
of corn and rice, one-fifth of potatoes. Vegetable 
proteids, as already stated, are less easily digest- 
ed than those belonng fo the animal kingdom, 
therefore iç must be remembered that a purely

over-fax the digestive organs more than a mixed 
dieç from both the animal and vegetable king- 
dores. Mueh depends upon the cooking of 
starehy foods in order to rgn«ler them digestible. 
(Stu,ly ehapter on Digestion in the Publie Sehool 
Physiology.) 
The digestion of starch--which is insoluble in 
cold water--rcally 1),gins with the cooking, 
which by softening the outer coating or fibre 
of the ,rains, causes them fo swell and burst, 
therel)y 1)r,-paring them for the clwmical change 
which is c«msed by tbe action of the salira lu 
converting the starch into a spccics of sugar 
before if enb.rs the stomach. Substances which 
are ius,,luble in cold water cannot be absorbed into 
the l, lood, thcr«.f,,re are hot of any value as food 
until thcy |rave become c|mnged, and ruade 
soluble, which overtaxes the digestive organs 
and causes trouble. The temi,crature of the 
salira is too low fo dissolve the starch fibre 
unaide,1. Each of the digestive juiccs has 
its om work to do, and thc salira acts 
directly upon the starchy fl»od; hence the im- 
portance of thoroug|dy masticating such food as 
bread, potatocs, rice, ceruals, etc. The action of 
heat, in baking, which causes the vapor fo rise, 
and foras the crust of starchy food, produces 
what is called dcxtrine, or I)artially digested 
starch. Dextrine is soluble in cold water, hence 
the ease with which crust and toast--when 
properly ma,le--are digested. I is more

While the ,q-ains contain less proteid than the 
lcgumes, they are more valuable on account of 
the vaiety of the nutrients contained in them, 
and are more ea.sily a, lapted to the dcmands of 
the appetite. Thcy, h)wever, require ],)ng, slow 
cooking in ordcr to softcn the iibre and rcn, ler 
the starch more soluble. Among the most im- 
portant we may place: 
A wheat kernel may be subdivided into three 
layers. The first or outer one contains the bran: 
second, the gluten, fats and salts; third, the starch. 
Statue of the minerai marrer for which wheat is 
so valuable is containcd in the bran, hcnce the 
value of at least a portion of that part of the 
wheat being included in bread flournot by 
the addition of coarse bran (which is indigest- 
ible) to the ordinary flour, but by the refining 
process employed n producing whole wheat 
flour. While wheat is used in other forms, 
principal use as food is in the form of flour. 
The following table, giving the composition of

COiPOSITI«-*N OF BREAD. 



 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

BREAD. 

T]te most valuable food pro,luct manufactured 
from flour is bread. 
]3read contains so many of the inoTedients re- 
quired to nourish the bo,]y, viz. : ftt, proteid, 
salts, sugar an,1 starch, that it may well be 
termed the "staff of lift." As it does not con- 
tain enough fat f,»r a perfect food the ad,lition 
of butter to it rcn,h.rs it more valuable as an 
article of dict. Mrs. Ellcn H. Richards gives 
the following expbtmtin of what constitutes 
ideal bread : " (1) It shoul,1 rctain as much as 
possible of the nutritive princil, les of the/o'ain 
from which it is ma,ht ; (2} it should be prepared 
lu such , mam,-r as fo secure the complete 
assimilttion of these nutritive principles; (3) 
it should be li;'ht and p»r«»us, so as to allow the 
digestive juiccs to pcnctrate it (luickly and 
thoroughly; (4) it should be nearly or quite free 
ïrom coarse bran. which causes too rapid mus- 
cular action to allow of complote digestion. Tins 
etthct is also produced whcn the bread is sour." 
Bread is ruade fr,»m a combinatioa of fiour, 
li«tuid (either milk or water), and a vegetable 
ferment called yeast (sec ycast recipes). The 
yeast acts slowly or rtpidly according fo the 
temperature to which it is exposed. The starch 
has fo be changed by the ferment called 
dimstase (,liastse is a vegetable ferment which 
converts starchy foods into a soluble material 
called maltose) into sugar, and the sugar into 
tlcohol and carbonic cid gaz (carbon dioxide),

whole mss. If is the effect of the ctrbonic acid 
gas upon the gluten, which, when checked af the 
proper rime belote the ferment bcco,ncs acetic 
(sour) by baking, produces the sweet, wholesome 
bread which is the pride of all good housekeepers. 
The kneading of bread is to break up the gas 
bubbles into small portions in or, lcr that the,'e 
may be no large holes and the fermentation be 
equal ttn'oughout. The loaf is baked in order to 
kill the ferment, to render the starch soluble, fo 
expand the carbonic acid gas and drive off the 
alcohol, fo stiffen the gluten and to form a crust 
wtfich shall have a plcasant flav,,r. Much of the 
indigestibility of bread is owil,g to the imperfect 
baking; Uld,.ss the interior of the loaf has reached 
_1_ F., the bacteria con- 
the sterilizing point, o 
tained in the yeast will hot be killed, and some 
of the gas will remain in the centre of the loaf. 
The scientific meth,»l of baking bread is fo fix 
the air cells as quickly as possible af first. This 
can be d,»ne better by baking the bread in small 
loaves in separate pans, th,.reby secul'ing a uni- 
form heat and more crust, which is considered to 
be the most easily digested part of the brea,1. 
Some cooks consi,ler that long, slow baking pro- 
duces a m,»re desil'able flavor and renders bread 
more digestible. One hundred pounds of flour 
will make an average of one hundred and thirty- 
rive potmds of breud. This incrca.. ,,f wight is 
due fo the addition of water.

Buckwheat is the least important of the

Rye is ahnost equal fo wheat in nutritive

Corn contains fat, protei,l and starch, and 
Droduces heat and energy. It is very fatteniug, 
aud when eaten as a vegetable is considered 
difficult of digestion. Corumeal is a wholesome 
food ; it contains more fat than wbeat flour, and

starch than any other cereal, but when properly

too little nitrogen to sati.fy the demands of the

CHAPTER VIII. 

Fruits. 

Fruits are composed largely of water, with 
starches, a vegetal)le jelly, pt'ctin, cellule,se and 
organic aci,ls. The most important acids in fruit 
are citïic, malle and taïtaric. Citric acid is 
found in lemons, limes and oranges; tartaric 
acid in graI3es; malle aci,l in apples, pears, 
peaches, apricots, gooseberries and currants. 
Among the last acid are peaehes, sweet alTles , 
bananas and prunes. Strawberries are moder- 
ately acid, while lemons and currants contain 
the m,Jst acid of ail. 

Uses of Fruit. 

(1) To furnish nutriment ; (2) to couvey water 
fo the system and relieve thirst; (3) to introduce 
variots mineral marrer (salts) and acids which 
improve the quality of the blood; (4) as anti- 
scorbutics; (5) as laxatives and cathartics; 
(6) fo stimulate the appetite, improve digestion 
and provide variety in the diet. Apples, lemons 
and oranges are especially valuable for the pot- 
ash salts, lime and maesia they contain. 
Fruit as a comm,m article of daily diet is highly 
beneficial, and should be used freely in season. 
Cooked fruit is more easily digested than raw, 
and when over-ripe should always be cooked in 
order fo prevent fruit poisoning.

TEA. 

DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

Nuts contain proteid, with some starch and 
sugar, but are hot considcr,.d valuable as nu- 
trients. Cocoanuts, almonds and English walnuts 
are the most nutritious. 

Beverages. 

Tannin is an astringent of vegetable origin 
which exists in tea, is also fould in cottie and 
wines, and is vçry injurious. Tea is a prepar- 
ation ruade fl-«t the leaves of a shrub called 
Thea. The diflçrence between black and green 
tea is due fo the mode of preparation, and not f 
separate spccics of plant. Green tea contains 
m,,re tamfin than black. The following table 
will show the difl;_.rence :--

The stimulating proprtics which/ca possesses, 
as well as its color and flavor, depend upon 
the season of the year af which the leaves are 
gathered, the variet.y of the plant the age of the 
leaves, which become tough as they grow older, 
and the tare exercised iii their preparation. 
Much depends upon the manner in which tea is 
infused. (1) Use freshly boiled water; (2) allow 



lb to infuse onIy three or four minubes, in or,|er 
to avoid extracting the tannin When carefully 
prepared as above, tea is nob considered unwhole- 
some for people in good health. 
Coffee is ruade from the berries of 
arabica, which are dricd, r«Jasted and browne,l. 
The following table gives an approximate idea 
of the composition of coffee beans (Konig) :--

Albumiaoids ............................. 13.98 
Other nitrogenoua matter ................. 45.09

Cffee is frequently adulterated with chicory, 
which is harmless. Coflhe should nob be allowed 
to boil long or stand in the coffee pot over a tire, 
as the tannin is extracted, which renders it more 
indigestible, hIuch controversy has been in- 
dulged in over the effccb of coffe upon the 
system, but like many other similar questions it 
bas hot reached a practical solution. The general 
opinion seems fo be that when properly made 
and used in moderation lb is a valuable stimulant 
and hot harmful fo adult

Condiments and spices are uscd as food ad- 
juucts; they supply little nourishment, the effcct 
l»..ing min]y stinm]ating, and are very injurious 
when used in excess. Thcy a,]d flvor fo foo,l

con«liments as pepper, curry, pickles, vin'gar and 
mustard, if abused, is decidedly harmful. Sait 
is the only necessary eondiinent, for reasons 
given in the chaptcr on raillerai matter. The 
blen,lin,g of flavors so as t.o make food more 
palatal»le without bcing itÙure,l is one of the fine 
arts in cookery. Some flavors, such as lemon 
juice, vinegar, etc., incrense the solw.nt pr,,p,.rties 
of tbe gastric juice, nmking certain foo,ls more 
digestible. 



CHAPTER IX. 

Preparing Food. 
The knowle,lge of f,)«»l wtlues and their rela- 
tion to the body will be of little use f,»r practical 
purposes unless combine,l with the knowledge of 
how the various foods should be pl'epar«.,l, either 
by cooking or in whate»r forln circumstauccs 
and the material nmy require. The first requi- 
site for cooking purposes is hcat ; this neccssitates 
the use of fuel. The fuels cl,iefly uscd for house- 
hold purposes are wood, ce»al, kr,».ene oi! and 
gas. Soflz w,»o,]s, such as pine or birch, are best 
for kind]ing and for a quick tire. Har, l woods, 
oak, ash, etc., burn more slowly, retain the heat 
longer, and are better adapted for cooking 
purp,»ses. 
Coal (anthracite) is about 95 per cent. carbon. 
It kindles slowly, gives a steady boat, and burns 
for a longer time without attention than wood. 
St»ves for burning oil an,l gas bave boc<,me 
popular, and are ver)- convenient and satisfacIx»ry 
for cooking purposes. 
Oil is considercd to be the cheapest fuel. oto. 
Gas is a very satisfactory fuel for cooking pur- 
poses, but can only be used in certain localities.

Great care should be exercised in the se]ection 
of a store or range. The plainer the range the

A FIRE. 

easier it will be to keep it clean. There should 
be plcnty of damI,ers that can be used to hasten 
the tire or to check it. Learn thoroughly the 
management of the range before beginning fo 
cook. In lighting a tire, remove the covers, 
brush the soot fr,,m the t,»p of the oven into the 
tire-box; clean out the grate (saving all the un- 
bmaaed coal, and cin,h.rs). Put in shavings or 
paper, then kin,lling arranged crosswise, allowing 
plenty of air space bct, ween the pieces, a little 
hard wood and a single layer of coal. Put on 
the covers, open the direct draft and ovcn damper, 
then light the paper. When the wood is thor- 
oughly kin, lled and the first layer of coal heated, 
fill the tire-box with coal evcn with the top of 
the oven. When the blue flame becomes white, 
close the oven damper, and ",vhen the coal is burn- 
ing free]y, shut the direct draft. Whên coal be- 
cornes bright red all through it has lost most of 
its heat. A ga'eat deal of coal is wasted by filliag 
the tire-box too full and leaving the drafts open 
till the coal is re,l. To keep a steady tire it is 
better to a,hl a little coal often rather than to 
add a large quantity and allow it to buaa 
out. :Never allow dust or cindcrs to accumulate 
around a range, êither inside or out. Learn fo 
open and shut the oven d,9or quietly and quickly. 
Study the amount of tire re«luired to heat the 
ovcn to the desired temperature. Learn which 
is the hottcr or coolcr side of the oven, and move 
the article which is being bakcd as required, 
being very careful to move it gently.

BREAD. 
As bread is one of the most important articles of the 
,laily diet, if naturally follows tlmt special attention 
,should be given to a subject upon which the health 
of the f«mily, fo a great extent, dei)ends. A know- 
le,]ge of the chemical changes and their effect (see Chai). 
VII) n,ust be understood before proficieny in bread- 
making can be attained. The first element to consider is 
the y,'«t.'t, and the generating of carbonic aci,1 gas, so 
as fo have the brea, l light, tend.r, anal I)orous. 
Yeast is a plant or vegetable growth pr«gluced from 
grain which has commenced fo bud or sprout, and which 
forms the sub,stance called diastase. This substance has 
the power to c,,vert ,star,'h into sugar. (See Champ. VII 
for eflhct of yea,st upon th,ur.) 
The temperature af which fermentation takes I)lace, 
and when to check it, are important features of bread- 
making. 
The liquid (milk or water) should be tei)id when mixed, 
as too great heat de,stroys the 'owth of the yeast. The 
dough should ri.se in a tcmp-rature of 75 ». After 
fermentation has become active the t««nperature may be 
gradually lowered--as in setting bread over night-- 
without in jury. 
Avoid a cobl draft or sudden change of temperatm'e, 
as if checks fermentation md affects the flavor. 
N,.ver allow br.d fo rise until if "settles," or runs 
over the ,si,le of the bowl. The usual rule is fo let if 
rise until it is double in bulk, both in the bowl and after 
if is I)ut into the I)ans. If if is hot convenient fo bake 
the bread when rea,ly, it may Le kneaded again and kept

in , cool place, to I)revent souring. Bread should be 
mixed in a stone or granite bowl. 
The only lleCesS«tl'y ingq'edients for bread are 
flour, salt, and yeast. Sugar may be a,l,h:d to reste»re 
natural sweetness of the fl«»ur which bas been lost dm'ing 
fermention, but it is hot necessary. If milk is uscd, 
and the bread well kneadcd, no other shortening is re- 
quired; but with watcr, fle a,ldition of  ]ittle butter 
or dripping nmkes the brcad more tender, thcrcfore it 
is more easily penetrated },y the digestive flui,ls. Tough, 
leathery bread is not easily digcstcd, no marrer how 
light it may be. As alrcady stated, by the action of 
heat the ferment is killed, the starch-gahs ruptured, 
the gas carricd off, and the crust formcd. In ordcr 
bread m:y be thoroughly c,,»ked, and plenty of crus 
fone,], ech le,af should be bakc,l in a i,an al)ou 4 ich,.s 
dcep, 4 fo 6 inches wi,le, and fr«m 8 to 12 inches 1,mg. 
Smaller loaves are cven more desirable. It is vcry diffi- 
cult  bake a large loaf so as to insure the escal)e of 
all the carbonic aci,l gas, an,l fo cook the starch 
ciently without injuring the trust, b,.si,l,.s entai]ing an 
unnecessary waste of fuel. The custom of baking sev- 
ertl loaves togethcr in one 1,rge pan is contrary to all 
scientific rules of brea,]-nmking. The owîn sh,»uld be hot 
enough to brown a spnful of flour in rive minutes, 
for bread. The dough should l'ise during the first fifteen 
minutes, then begin fo brown; keep t],e ]mat steady for 
the next fifteen or twenty minutes, then decrease it. If 
tire oven is too hot a hard crust will form and prcvent 
the dough from rising, which 'ill not only cause the 
bread  be heavy, but will prcvent the gas from 
esping. If, on the other hand, the oven is not hot

enough, the bread will go on rising until if becomes sour. 
A loaf, the size already mentioned, should take from 
fifty-five fo sixty minutes fo bake, and should give a 
hollow sound, if tapped, when removed from the oven. 
B.tt.r take too long than hot long enough, as doughy 
brca,1 is most objectionable and unwholesome. If the 
crust is bcginning fo burn, cover the loaf with brown 
paper, and rcduce the heat, but bave a brown crust, hot 
a whity-brown, which is usually hard and without flavor. 
Upon removing the loaves from the paris, place them 
on a rack, where the air may circulate freely. Never 
leave warm bread on « pine table, or where if wfll absorb 
odors.

EGGS. 
While eggs are nuttious and valuable as fool they 
should hot be used too freely, as they are a highly con- 
eentrated form of food. The albumen (white) of egg is 
one of the mosç valuable tissue builders. Mueh depends 
upon the manner i which they are eooked. Eggs fried 
in fat or hard boiled are very in, ligestible. Do hot use 
an egg until if has been laid some hours, as the white 
does hot beeome thiek till then and eannot be beaten 
stiff. Eggs should be kept in a cool dark i»laee, and 
handled earefully in or,ler to avoid nfixing the white 
and yolk, whieh causes the egg fo spoil quickly. 

]OILED EGG,. 

Have the water boiling in a saucepan. Put in the eggs 
and move to the back of the store n'lere the water will 
keep hot, about ]î5 or 180 F., for from 8 to 10 mbmtes. 
If the back of the store is too hot, more to the hearth. 
The white should be of a soft, jelly-like consistency, the 
yolks sort but not li,luid. An egg fo be cooked soif 
should never be cooked in boiling water. 



Cook eggs for °O miroites in water jus below tire 
boiling point. The yolk of an egg cooked 10 minutes is 
tough and in,ligestible; 20 minutes will make i dry and 
mealy, when itis ,ore easily penetrated by the gastric 
fluid. 

POACHED EGGS. 

Have a clean, shallow pan nearly full of salted and 
boiling water. Remove the scum and let the water just 
simmer. Break each eo'«, careful]y into a saucer and 
slip ibgent]y into the waer. Dip the water over if 
with the en,l of the spoon, and when a film has f,rmed 
over the yolk an«l the white is like a soft j,.lly, take up 
with a skimmer and place on a piece of neatly trimmed 
toast. This is the mos wholesome way of cooking 
for servig with haro or bacon. 

OMELET. 

Beat. the yolks of two eggs, add two t.bsps, of milk, 1 
ssp. of sait and ¼ of a ssp. of pepper. Beat the whites till 
stiffand dry. Cut and fohl them into the yolks till just 
covered, ttave a elean, smooth omèlet pan (or spider). 
When hot, tub well xvith a teaspoonful of butter; see 
that t.he butter is ail over the pan, tm'n in the olnelet 
and spread evenly on the pan. Cook until slightly 
browned underneath, bcing careful hot to let it bm'n ; set

FRUIT. 

If people would on]y realize the value of fruit in its 
natural state, much of the time devoted to the prepara- 
tion of pies, pu,ldings, etc., would be saved. Ail un- 
cooked fruit should be thoroughly ripe and served fresh 
and cold. Sometimes fruit is more easily digested when 
the woody fibre has been softened by cooking than when 
in its natural state, therefore a few simple recipes for 
cooking ff'uit are given. 

APPLESAUCE. 

Pare, core and quarter 6 or 8 tart apples. $lake a 
syrup with x cup of sngar, - cup of water, and a little 
grated lemon peel. When boiling, a, ld the apples and 
cook carefully ti]l they are just tender, but hot broken. 
Remove them carefully, boil the syrup down a little and 
pour it over the apples. (For serving with roast goose, 
etc., cook the apples in a little water, mash until smooth, 
dd sugar to taste.) - 

CODDLED APPLES. 

Pare fart apples of uniform size; remove the cores 
without breaking the apples. Stand them in the botton 
of a ,n-anite ket.tle, sprinkle thickly with sugar, eover

and allow the apples to steam on the back I,art of the 
store till tender. Lift earefully without breaking, pour 
the syrup over them an,l stand away to cool (delicious 
served with whipped eream).

Vegctables shouid be use,l very frcely, as they contain 
saline substances which counteract the effect of too much 
meafi, and are the chier somme of mineral supply for the

RECIPES--SOUPS. 89 

SOUPS. 

Soups may be divided into two classes, soup made with 
stock, and with milk. As soup should form part of 
the regular daily diet, and may be ruade from the 
cheaper materials, it is absolutely necessary that every 
housekeeper should understand the art of nmking it 
l»roperly. 
In the first place if is well to know what may be used 
in the process of soup making. The first an«l most im- 
portant step is to prepare the stock. For this purpose 
h,zve a large eal'then bowl or "catch all," as some teachers 
call it. Into this put all the bones, trimmings, bits of 
steak or chop and gravy which hts been h'ft over. Keep 
in a cold place. When needed, cover with col,1 water and 
sinmmr 4 or 5 hours; strain and set away fo cool. When 
col,l, remove the fat wMch will bave forme,1 a solid coat- 
ing on the top. The stock is now ready for use. By 
saving the remains of vegetables cooked f,,r the table, 
t}e outer stocks of celer3, a hard boiled e¢,,,, etc., a very 
palatable and nutritious soup may be ma«le at a trifling 
co,t. In familles where large quantities of meat are 
used, there should be sufflcient mateial without 
buying meat for soup. If is noç necessary to bave all 
the ingredients mentioned in some recipes in order fo 
secure satisfactory results. It will, however, be necessar 3- 
to understand soup flavorings, so as to know which ones 
may be left out. Stock ruade from the shin of beef, or 
from the cheaper piec:s which contain the coaler fibre 
and gristle, require long, slow cookin/g (sec Metho, ls). 
Never soak meat in water bcfore cooking in any form. 
Wipe carefully with a damp cloth bef,,re cutting or pre-

paring for use. For soup break or saw the bones into 
small pieces, and for each pound of meat and bone allow 
1 qt. of col«l water. Cover the kettle closely and let it 
heat slowly until it reaches the simmcring point, when 
it should be moved back and kept at that deq'ee for 
several hours. Soup should never be allowed to boil 
hard. The scum which rises fo the surface is the albu- 
1,mn an,l juices of the meat, and should not be skimmed 
off: If the kettle is clean, and all impurities removed from 
the meat, there will hot be anything objectionable in the 
scun Stock must always be allowed to reman until 
cold, so that the ftt may be removed before using. 
A strong, greasy soup is rarely relished, and is one of 
the principal reasons why so many people «lis]ike this 
valuable article of diet. I)o hot add sait to the meat 
which is bcing prepared for stock until a few minutes 
before removing from the tire. Salt hardens the water 
if added at first and makes the tissues more difficult to 
dissolve. Stock  may be kept for severa| davs by occasion- 
ally brindng it to the boiling point. This is not neces- 
sary in wintr if it is kept in a cold place.

killed. Cut off the head, and if the fowl is la» be roasted, 
slip the skin back from the neck and cut the neck off 
close to the body, leaving skin enough to fold over on the 
back. Remove the windpipe, pull the crop away from 
the skin on the neck and breast, and cut off close fo the 
openiug in the body. Cut through the skin about 2 
inches below the leg joint, bond the leg at the eut by 
pressing it on the edge of the table and break off th« 
bone. Tl,en pull out the tendon. If care be takt.n to 
cut only through the skin, thêse cor,ls may be pulh«l out 
easily, one at a rime, with the fingers; or by putting 
the foot of the fowl against the casing of a door, then 
shut the door tightly and pull on the h.g. The drum 
stick of a toast chicken or turkey is greatly improved 
by removing the tendons. Cutoutthe oil bag in the 
rail, make an incision near the vent, insert two fingers, 
keeping the fingers up close to the breast bone until you 
can reach in beyond the liver and heart, and loosen on 
either side down toward the back. Draw everything

quickly and wipe dry. In stuffing and trussing a fowl, 
plnce the fowl in a bowl and put the stuflàng in at the

PASTRY. 
Pastry, unless light and tender, should never be catch; 
even then it should be avoided by people with poor 
digestion. There are so many food preparations supcrior 
to pastry in both nutritive value and cost of time and 
material, that it will be wise fo give it a very seconda,'y 
place in the training of  culinary artist. HCm'ever, as 
it is still  popular fancy with many, we may as well 
mke the best of it. ]3utter is more wholesome in pastry 
than lard, alhough the latter makes  light crust. In 
order to secure satisfactory results in pastl'y making-- 
espeeially puff pastry--three things should be observe,l : 
(1) bave all the materials cold ; (2) use as little liquid as 
possible; (3) handle lightly and quickly. Pastry should 
be very e«»l,l when it is put into the oven. Have the 
oven very hot.

hot soapy water, then rinse them in eold water, as this 
will prevent the butter from stieking to the hands. Turn 
the cold watr out of the bowl ; fill it with iee water, put 
the butter into it and work with the hands until sort and 
elastie. Drain the water froln the butter and place on

A FEW GENERAL HINTS. 

CANNIN'G AN'D PRESERVING. 
Cauning fruit is simply sterilizing and sealing in air- 
tight ja. Any fresh ripe fruit may be kei)t in this way. 
By observing a few general rules any housekeeper may 
preserve fruit successfully. 1st. Have goo«l fruit, rii)e 
a, nd fresh. 2nd. Have air-tight jars--test by tïlling with 
water and inverting. 3rd. See that the jars have bcen wcll 
scalded ,nd are free from odor of any kin«l. 4th. Have 
riras ncl covers af hand so that the jars may be sealed 
immediately when the fruit is put into them. 5th. Fill the 
jars till they overflow. 6th. Let the syrup simm_r for 
a few minutes before putting in the fruit. 7th. Cook 
the fruit slowly so as to avoi,] breakinv ; I)lace carefully 
in the jars, fill up with syrup and seal af once. A good 
method for canning fruit is to cook the fruit in the jars, 
by placing them in a boiler or kettle of water with a, 
wire fmme or something underneath to avoi,] breaking. 
Fill the jar with fruit ; pour over a s)n'up of the dcsired 
consistency, screw on the toi) loose]y--so as fo allow the 
gas fo escai)e--an,l 1,lace in the boilcr ; fill the boiler with 
coM water ui) to thc rira of the jar and bring slowly to 
boiling I)oint. Al]ow small fruits fo remain 10 minutes, 
,nd I)eoehes, eears, etc., 15 minutes ,ftcr the water bvils. 
Remove the toi)s, till fo overflowiug with boiling syrtp, 
and seal af once. By this method fruit retains the flavor 
somewhat more than by cookiug in an open kettle. An 
average ssq-u p for canning fruit is nmde by adding a 
I)oun,] of sugar to  I)int of wat_r (see rule 6). In or, ler 
fo prevent frui jars from cracking, wring , cloth out of 
cold water on which the jar shoul,l be placed before 
filling with the hot fruit, or by placing , silver spoon or 
fork in the jar 1)ef,»re putting in the syrui) , fruit or jclly. 



Always see that the tops are screwed on tightly before 
putting the jar away in a cool place, which should hot 
be done until the fruit has become cold. 

PRESERVING. 
Preserving differs from canning in the amount of sugar 
used: otherwise the metho«] is similar. Preserves are 
usually ruade from e«lual weights of sugar and fruit, and 
cooked af least 20 minutes. 

JELLIES. 

Fruit jellies are n,ade of e_lual parts of clear fruit juice 
and sugar. Crab aIiles, currants, and quinces are the 
most reliable fruits for jelly. Cook the fruitcurrants 
may be mashed and drained without cooking--until soft. 
Drain over night through a flannêl bag. In the morn- 
ing measure 1 pint of sugar for each pint of juice. Heat 
the sugar in  large earthen bowl in the oven, stirring 
often fo prevent burning. Let the juice boil 20 minutes; 
thên ad«l the hot sugar and boil about 5 minutes longer, 
or mtil it thickens whcn dropped from a spoon. 

SUGGESTIONS FOR YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER,S. 

Carefully supervise the daily dieta .ry so that a reason- 
 able proportion of the necessar" food elements may be 
provided. See tl,at the proportion of proteid is one part 
to four of carboh.v,lrates and fat.s. Adapt the dietary fo 
the season an,1 climate. Do hot wase time and money 
in prepm'ing qch puddings, entrees, cakes, etc., when fresh 
fruit, vegetables, salads, etc., are so much more nutritious, 
economical and convenient. Arrange fo ha,ce a variety

of food---different kinds of meat, fish,and poultry--cooked 
in various ways. Sec that suitable food is provided for 
the children; especial]y pure milk and food coutaining 
mineral salts. Do not allow children to use tea, coffee, 
or other stimulants. A glass of hot milk (hOt boiled) is 
the best stimulant for a chil«l when wearied with study 
or over exertion of any kind. 
Sec that the water which has stood in the pipes over 
night is drawn before filling the tea-kettle for breakfast, 
or using the water for pOl'ldge or other purposes. Rinse 
the tea-kettle every molning belote using, zNever use 
water from the hot tank f«»r cooking. Sec that the 
water used for drinking purposes is pure ; if suspicious, 
either have if filtered or boiled before using. Do hot 
allow soiled rags, dish cloths or towels fo lie around the 
kitchen. Wash and scald the dish chths and towels 
after each dish washing, hanging them outside fo dry 
--if poasible. Keep plenty of clean towels; some fine 
ones for g]ass and china, coarser ones for general use. 
Have special cloths for kitchen use. Keep a holder 
within reach of the oven so as to avoid bunfing the 
fingers, or using an a]?ron. ee that a kett]eful of 
boiling water is poured down the sink pipes every da)'. 
All boxes, ja-s and shelves in which food is kept, nmst 
be kept scrupulously clean and well aired. The rcfriger- 
ator requires special attention; sec that the drain pipe 
and interior of ice-box are kept thoroughly clean. A stiff 
wire with a piece of cloth fastened on the end may be 
used fo clean the drain pipe af least once a week. Do not 
have any closet under the sink or places of concealment 
for dirty pots and pans. Bowls which bave been used for 
flour mixtures should be filled with cold water if hot

wshed immediately after using. Never put kitehen 
knives and forks into the dish water, as if loosens the 
handles; hold them in the hand and wash with the dish 
eloth. Burn all refuse, both for eonvenienee and as a 
sanitary measure. If a refuse pail is used, if shoald be 
scalded frequently and a solution of carbolic acid, chloride 
of lime or other disinfectant used. Do not put paris and 
kettles hall filled with water on the store fo soak, as 
it only hardens whatever may bave adhered to the 
kettle and makes it more difficult to clean. 

)ISH VASHING. 

Many young housekeepers look upon dish washing 
as the "bug-bear" of the kitchen. It need not be 
disagreeal»le "«-ork; indeed the washing of china, glass 
an,l silver ware may be placed anaong the arts of house- 
keeping. It should be the ambition of every young 
housekeeper to know how everything pertaining fo 
househol,l management should be done, and how to do 
it; whether she ha.s fo do it herself or direct othel. 
One of the most important duties is dish-washinff. A 
few simple rules may help fo make this duty less objec- 
tionable. 1. Collect knives, forks an,] spoons by them- 
selves. Scrape the dishes, empty the cups, and arrange 
neatly in the order in which they are to be washe, l. 
2. Nevor pile dishes indiscriminately in a dish pan, as each 
kind requires separate treatment. 8. Havetwo pans hall 
full of water- one with soapy water, the other with 
clear hot water for rinsinK. 4. Wash the glassware first, 
in mo,lerately hot water, slip the glasses in sideways so 
that the h,,t water mav strike insi,le and outside af once, 



SUGGESTIONS FOR YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS. 131 

which will prevent breaking. Rinse and wipe at once, 
as they will be much brighter and clearer than if alb,wed 
to drain. 5. If the glass is eut, use  brush to cleanse 
out all the grooves. As it is difflcul to dry such glass- 
ware, i should be dipped in clear cold water aft,.r 
washing, and allowed to drain. 6. Always keep tl,," 
towel between the hands and the glass so as to avoid 
finger marks, linse glasses which have contahmd milk 
in cold water before washing. 7. Next wa.h the sih»_r 
and wipe at once; then the china, first in the hot suds, 
then rinse in the clear hot watr; Wil,e while warm. 
8. Change dish water oftcu, especially if the di.hes 
are greasy; and do not ]eave the soap in the wat_r to 
wa.ste and stick to the dishes. 9. Use fresh water for 
the kitchen crockery, and pots and pans. After wiping 
tinware, place if on the hearth fo dry, as it rusts v«,ry 
easily. 10. Polish the knives with bathbrick, woc,1 
ashes or san(lsoap. Wash, and wipe perfectly dry ; h«,ld 
in the hand and wash with the dish cloth ; do hot und.r 
any circumstances allow knives and forks to lie in hot 
water. Next wash the tray, the rinsing pan, tlJe table and 
the sink. Finally, thê dish towels, dish cloth and dish 
pan. 
Pans in which fish or onions have been cooked should 
be washed and scalded, then fille,l with water, in which 
put a tsp. of soda. Place them on the top of the store 
for ½ hour; this will remove the flavor of fish or onions, 
If the steel of knives or forks should become rusted, dip 
them in sweet oil and let stand for twcnty-four hours, 
then tub with powdered quicl¢-]ime and the stain will 
be removed. Rub the ivory handles which bave become 
stained, with whiting and spirits of turpentine. 



13 .9. DOMISTIC SCIENCE. 

VENTILATION AND SANITATION. 
As pure air is one of the essentials of good health, it 
follows that one of the chier duties of  housekeeper is 
to see that the family sup[»ly of this necessary elementis 
properly regulated. Ve T few housekeepers realize the 
im[»ortance of ventilation in promoting the general 
health and comfort of the family.  the scope of this 
book prevents anything further than a few suggestions 
or a brief outline of the principles underlying these im- 
pooEant questions, 'e will adopt the rule followed in the 
preceding chapter, benning with the cellar: l. Sec 
that surface water is carried away from aH sides, by 
either natal or aloEificial drain, and that the cellar is 
pcrfectly dç'. Have enough windows in the cellar to 
secure plenty of light and air, and sec that they are opened 
every day. 2. Have the cellar thorou¢hly cleaned and 
whitewashed with lime at least once  yeer, twice ff pos- 
sible, in the spring and fall. 3. Keep the coal in a dry 
place. 4. Do not allow decomposed vegetables, or old 
bottles, which may cause unpleasant odo, to accumulate 
in the cellar. Unless there is a special eellar for vege- 
tables, where they my be kept at  pror temperature 
and oerelly loeked after, it is much better for the 
housekeeper to purchasc in small «tuantities. Remember 
the ventilation of the cellar is of the eatest impoance, 
and should never be neglected. 
One of th, most noted authorities in Amefica, on the 
question of ventilation, says: "The three imposant 
objects are, 1) To proxfide an abundance of pe air in 
eve paoE of the hoe; 2) To void drafts, either hot 
or cold; (3) To prode means of pe for fo a and 



SUGGESTIONS FOR YOUNG HOVSEKEEPERS. 133 

odors." As before stated, much of the vigor, comfort and 
happiness of the family depends upon attention to these 
matters. :Next fo the celtar, we will take thc living and 
sleeping rooms, which should be thoroughly aired cvery 
da3", hot simI»ly by opening the window a 5.w iches . 
af the botton, or--as in some double or outside win, lows-- 
by e little opening  few inchcs wide ; but by causing  
circulation of air in the room, and proqding an outl,'t for 
foul air near the ceiling, which may be donc by lowering 
the window frofia the top. An ourlet 5)r foul air is quite 
as important as an inlet for fresh air. 
If there is a skylight at the top of the house, it should 
be kept open a few inches ail the rime as an outlet for 
impure air; an attic window will serve the saine purpose. 
Have dehors and windows so arranged that a draft may 
be ruade possible when needed fo change the air of a 
room quickly, or in airing bedclothes; two windows being 
of course more desirable. After dressing in the morning, 
open the window of the sleeping room, top and bottom; 
turn back the clothes over one or two chairs; place 
pillows and mattress where they will have a current of 
fresh air; also open the closet door. I)o hot allow water 
fo remain in  bedroom more than twenty-four home. 
When a sleeping room bas been used for a sewing or 
sitting room during the day, if should be thoroughly 
aired before bedtime. Open the bathroom window fre- 
quently, top and bottom, for a few minutes, so as fo allow 
the air to escape out of doors instead of into other parts 
of the house. A nursery, sitting room or school room, 
which has been occupied by a numbcr of peopIe, should 
bave the windows open, top and bottom, while the occu- 
pants are af meals or elsewhere. A room which has been 



1'-]- ] » »-MEST1C 8('IENCE. 

occupie,l as a family sitting room during the evening 
sllould be airçd by the last member of the family fo 
retire, in ord,.r fo prcvent the impure air making its way 
through the house during the night. 
Special attention shoulfl be dven to kitchen ventila- 
tion. In or,]er fo prevcnt kitchen odors from penetrating 
tllrough tlle other parts of tl,e house, if is necessary to 
have an outlet for stcam an,] impure air near the ceiling 
in the kit«hc. If win,l,ws arc placed so as to secm'e a 
draft, th,.y may be opene,l at the top only, when they 
will serve the purpose a,]mirably. There should be a 
ventilating flue in all kitcllen chimneys. In building a 
llouse, see that restcr ventilators are placed in the 
kitchen on different walls, which may be closed in very 
ol,l weather. 

LAUNDRY W»RK. 

As tbe first essential of laundry vork is a plentiful 
supply of watcr, a, word concerning that necessary article 
may uot be out of place. Pure water is a chemlcal com- 
poun,l of hydrogen and oxygen. It has great absorbent 
al01 solvcnt powers, ther_f,re pure water is seldom round. 
The first fall of al,y shower is mixed with fhe in,pu_rities 
,,[ the air; among tbese may be acids, ammonia and 
carbon in the form of soot and creosote. It is these 
iml,urities which cause the stain left when rain water 
stands on the window-sill or other finished wood. Rain 
water absorbs more or lcss carbon dioxide from various 
sources, and soaking into tbe soil oftcn cornes in contact 
with lime, magqmsia and other compounds. Water 
saturat.d with carbon dioxide will dissolve these sub- 



SUGGESTIONS FOR YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS. 135 

stances, formbg carbonetes or other salts which are 
soluble ; such water is known as "" hard." 
Watcr for domestic uses is called either "har, l " or 
"soft," according fo the amount of salts which it may 
contain. When soap is a,|ded fo harcl water, the new 
eompound formed by the mion of the lime with the 
fatty acid of the soap is insoluble, and is deposited upon 
the surface of any article with whieh it cornes in contact. 
This is the reason why "hard "water rcquires more soap 
when used for laundry work. It is much botter fo soften 
the water by the addition of alkalies, ammoni or sal- 
sod before using for lauu,lry I)urI)oses than fo dcpcn,1 
eutirely upon soap for eleansing. 
Anotlwr important material used in the laundry is soap. 
In i)Ul-ehasilg soaI), it is safer fo ehoose the make of some 
well-known firm, who have a reputation fo lose if their 
produefs are hot good ; and for anything stronger thau 
soap, if is better fo buy sal-soda and use if knoving]y 
than fo trust to the vari,3us packages so extensive]y 
advertised. Washing sodtt shoul,1 alwtys be dissolved in 
a separate vessel, and a,lded fo the water fo be used. 
Ammoni may be used, but ifs too fr('quent use will 
yellow bl_aehed fabric. Borax is an effeetual clcansr, 
disinfectant and bleacher. If is more expensive thal 
alnnonia or soda, bu is the safes alkali to use. Turpen- 
fine is valuable in removing grease ; 1 tbsl), fo a quart of 
water will serve for washing silks and other delicate 
materials. It should never be used in hot water. 
Rerrwviag Stains.--All spots and stains should be 
tak«,n out before fle clothes are put into the general 
wash fo be treated with soai). Fruit staius are the most 



136 DOMESTIC SCIEN'CE. 

frequent and the most indelible, when neglected. The 
composition of fruit juice is readily dissolved by boiling 
water. Stretch the ætained part over an earthen dish 
and pour boiling water upon the stain until it disappears. 
If fruit stains are allowed fo remain, they will require 
an acid, or in some cases a bleaching liquid like chloride 
of lime fo remove them. Wine stains should be 
immediately covered with a thick layer of salt. Boiling 
milk may be used for taking out wine or fruit stain 
Medicine stains usually yield to alcohol. Iodine dissolves 
in ether or chloroform. 
Coffee, tea and cocoa stain badly; the latter, if neglected, 
will resist to the destruction of the fabric. These ail 
contain tannin, besides various coloring matters, and are 
" fixed "' by soap and water. Clear boiling water will 
often remove fresh coffee and tea stains, although it is 
safer to sprinkle the stains with borax and soak in cold 
water first. An alkaline solution of great e and 
convenience is Javelle water. It will remove stair and 
is a general bleacher. It is composed of 1 lb. of sal-soda 
with ¼ lb. of chloride of lime in 2 quarts of boiling 
water. When the substances bave dissolved as much as 
they will, and become cool and settled, pour off the clear 
liquid and bottle it for use. Be careful hot to allow any 
of the solid portions fo pass into the bottle. Use the 
dregs fr scouring unpainted woodwork, or fo cleanse 
waste pipes When a spot is found on a white table- 
cloth place under if an inverted plate. Apply Javelle 
water with a soft tooth brush (the use of the brush pro- 
tects the skin and the nails). Rub gently till the stain 
disappears, then rinse in clear water and tinally in 
ammonia. Blood stains require clear cold or tepid water; 



SUGGESTIONS FOR YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS. 137 

hoç water and soap render the red coloring lllattcr lss 
soluble. When the stain is nearly gone soap and hot 
water may be used. Stains from meat juice should be 
treated in the saine way. Vlletl blood is mixe«l with 
mucous, as in the case of handk«'chiefs, if is well to soak 
the stains for SOltm hours in a solution of sali and cold 
water--2 tablespoonfuls fo a quart. Grass stains dissolve 
in alcohol. If applied inllncdiately, alnlllonia and watcr 
will sometimes wasb thelll out. 
The following methods have proved successful, and 
may be tried where colors are likely to be affected by 
alcohol. Molasses, or a paste of soap and cooking soda 
may be spread over the stain and lcft for some hours, or 
the stain nlay be kept moist in the sunshilm mltil the 
green color bas changed to brown, when it will wash out 
in pure watcr. Mil,lew requiresdifferent treatment from 
auy prviously considered. Strong soap suds, a layer of 
sort soap and pulvcrized chalk, or one of chalk aud salt, 
are all effective, if in addition the moisteucd cloth be 
subjccted to strong sunlight, which kills the plant and 
bleaches the fibre. Javelle watcr nmy be tried in cases 
of advanccd growth, but success is hOt alwa-s assured. 
Some of the animal and vegetable oils may be taken out 
by soap and cold water, or dissolved in naphtha, chloro- 
form, ether, etc. Some of the vegetable oils are soluble 
in hot alcohol (care being taken that the temperature be 
hot raised to the poilt of igniting). Vaseline stains 
should be soaked in kerosene before water and soap 
touch them. 
Ink spots on white goods are the saine in character as 
on colored fabrics. Where the ilik is an iron compound, 
t]le stain may be treated with oxalic, muriatic or hot 



138 DOMESTIC S('I EN'CE. 

tartaric acid, applied in the same manner as for iron 
rust stains. N'o definite rule can be given, for some inks 
are affecte«l by stroug alkalies, others by aci,ls, while 
some will ,lissolve in clear water. Red iron ru.st spot.s 
must be trcated with aci,1. Fill an eartlmn dish two- 
thirds full of hot water and stretch the stained cloth over 
this. Have two other dishes with clear water in one and 
ammonia water in the other. The steam from the hot 
watcr will furnish the heat and moisture fax'orable for 
chemical action. Drop a little muriatic acid on the stain; 
let it remain a laoment, then ]ower the cloth into the 
c]ear water. Repent unti] the stain disappears. Rinse 
carefu]]y in the clear water and finally ilmnee in the 
ammoni: water, that any excess of acid may bc neutra]- 
ized and the fabric protected. Salt and ]emon juice are 
often suflïcicnt f,r a slight stain. 
3Itny spot.s appear upon white goods, which re.semble 
those ma, le by iron ast, oî the fabrics themselves acquire 
 y,.ll,wish ting« This i.s the result of the use of blueing 
and soap, where tlm clothes bave been imperfectly tqnsed. 
Therefore, if all dirt is re.moved, and the cl,thes thor- 
ough]y rinse,-I from ail soap or alkalies use,1 in removing 
the dirt, and exposed for a long time fo air and sun«hine, 
the use of blueing i.s unnecessary. In citiês, where con- 
veniences for drying and bleaching in the sunshine are 
fow, a thorough bleaching two or three rimes a year is a 
eces.ity; but in the country it is wiser to abolish all use 
of blueing and let the sun, in its action with moisture 
and the oxygen of the air, keep the c]othes white and 
[»ure. Freezing aids in bleaching, for if retains the 
moisture upon which the sun can act so much longer. 
When c]ean grass, dew and sunshine are hOt available, 



SUGGESTIt»NS FoR Y()I'NG HOUSEKEEPERS. 139 

use a b|eaching powder. Directions for the use of the 
powder usua!ly accompany tl,e can in which itis bought. 
Care n, us be taken o comp]ee]y rinse out the aci,l 
present in the pow&r. Grease is more quick]y actc,l 
un by hot water than by cold, but other organic mattcr 
is fixed by the hot water. An effective mcthod is to soak 
thoroughly the most soiled p,,rtion of the clothes, fold 
these togethcr towards the centre, roll the whole tightly 
and ak in col,l water. The water sh,,uld just o»vcr the 
artich-s. In this way the soap is kept whcre itis most 
nt.e,le,1, and hot washe,l away before it has ,1,me ifs work. 
Whcn the elothes are unrolled, the dire may be washed 
out with lcss rubbing. Too long soaing, whcn a strong 
soap is use, I, will weaken the fabric. 

Wlwther to boil clothes or hot, depends largely upon 
the purity of the materials used and the care exercised. 
Many feel that the ad,litional disinfection which boiling 
insures, is an element of cleanness hot to be disr«.gar, le,1, 
while others insist that boiling yellows the clothes. This 
yellowness may be caused by impure matcrial in the 
soap, the deposit of iron from the water or the 1,oiler; 
the imperfect washing of the clothes, that is, thc organic 
,,atter is hot thorou.ghly removed. The safer 1,rocess is 
to put the clothes into cold water, with little or no soap, 
let the temperature fise gradually fo boiling point and 
remain thcre for a f,.w minutes. Soap is more readily 
dissolved by hot than by cold wat,.r, hcnce the boiling 
should heIp in the COml,lete removal of the soap, and 
should precede the rinsin.g. O,,e tablespoonful of l»,rax 
fo every galh,n of water a,lded to each boilerful, serres as 
a bleacher and disinfectant. Scalding or pouring boiling 



140 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

water over the clothes is hot so effectual for their disin- 
fection as boiling, because the temperature is so quickly 
loweld. 
The main points in laundry cleansing seem tobe: (1) 
The removal of all stains; (2) Sort water and a good 
quality of soap ; (3) The use of alkalies in solution only ; 
(4) N,»ç t,o ]mç nor too much water, while the soap is 
aeting on the dirt; (5) Thorouzh rin.ing, that all alkali 
may be rcmove,l; (6) Long exposure to sunlight, the best 
bleaeher an,l ,lisinfeetant. 

WASHING OF WO«)LLENS. 
A|l wool goods require the greatest care h washing. 
The diff,.rent watel used should be of the saine tempera- 
ture, and never tçx) hot to be borne eomfortably by the 
ha,ds. Soap should always be used in the form of a 
solution. No soap should be rubbed on the fabrie, a.nd 
only a g-od white sap, free from resin, or a sort potash 
soap is allowable. 3Iake eaeh water slightly soapy, and 
leave  very little in the fabrie at the last rinsing, in 
or, let to furnish a dressing as nearly like the original as 
possible. Ammonia or krax is sometimes used in pre- 
h«'enee to soap. For pure white flannel borax is the 
most satisfaetory, on aeeount of its bleaehing quality. 
,)nly enough of any alkali should be used fo make the 
water X»_l-y sort. 
Wool fibres collect mueh dust, and should therefore be 
thoroughly brushed or shaken belote the fabrie is put 
into tbe water. Woollen fabrles shouhl be eleansed bi" 
squeezing, and hot by rubbing. Wool should hot be 
wrung by hand. Either run the fabrie smoothly through 



SUGGESTIONS FOR YOU'G HOUSEKEEPERS. 141 

a wringer or squeeze the water out, so that the fibres mty 
hot become twisted. Woollen articles may be dried more 
quickly by rolling the article tightly in a thick, dry 
towel or sheet, and squeezing the who]e till ail moisture 
is absorbe& Shake the article thoroughly before pltc- 
ing fo dry. Woollen goods should hOt be allowe,1 to 
freeze, for the teeth become knotted and hard. 

COLORED COTTONS. 
Colored cottons should have their colors fixed before 
washing. Salt will set most colors, but the proccss nmst 
be repeated at each washing. Alum sers the colors per- 
manently, and af the saine rime r«mders the fabric less 
combusçible, if used in strong solution after tbe final 
rinsing. Dish cloths and dish towels must be kepç cl,,an 
as a matter of health, as well as a neeessity for eh.an, 
bright tableware. The greasy dish eloth furnishes a 
most favorable field for the growth of germ If ,ust 
be washed with soap and hoç water and dried thoroughly 
eaeh rime. Ail sueh eloths should form parç of the 
weekly wash and reeeive ail the disinfeetion possible, 
with soap, hot water and long drying in the sunshine 
and open air. Beware of the disease-breeding, greasy, 
damp, dish eloth hung in a, warm, dark plaee. Oven 
towels, soiled with soot, ete., may be soaked over night 
in just enough kerosene to eover, then washed in eold 
water and soap. 
Laundry tuhs should be carefully washed and dried. 
Wooden tubs, if kept in a dry place, should be turned 
upside dom, and have the bottoms eovered with a little 
waer. The rubber rollers of he wringer may be kept 
elean and white by rubbing them with a, elean eloth and 



a few drops of kerosene (coal oil). Ail waste pipes, from 
that of the kitchen sink to that of the refrigerator, 
become foul vith grease, lint, dust and other organie 
matters which are the result of bacterial action. They 
are sources of contamination fo the air of the entire 
h,mse an,1 to the food supply, thereby endangering 
health. 
Al] bath, wash basin and water-c]oset pipes shou]d be 
flushed generously (as stated in  previous chapter) once 
a day af least. The kitchcn sink pipe and lam»]ry pipes 
shouhl have a thorough c]eaning with a strong boi]ing 
solution of washing soda daily, and  monthly flushing 
with crude potash. The soda solution should be used 
for c]eansing the drain pipe of the refrigerator. 

CAt/ING FOR INVALIDS. 

One of the first consi,lerations in caring for an invalid 
is the vontilation of the siek room. Care must ge taken 
tlmt the air is hot vitiated by anything in the room, sueh 
as a kerosene lamp, wilted eut flowers, soiled elothing, 
etc. The bed should be so arranged as fo avoid a dnfft 
---espeeially when airing the room. If thê room is too 
small to allow this, a very good way to protect the 
patient is to raise an umbrel]a and place it over the head 
and shoulders ; over this puç a blanket while the room is 
being aired; allowing it fo remain until the room has 
reached the dosired temperature again. :Never turn the 
wick of a lamp below the point of free combustion in 
the room of either sick or well, as the odor is hot only 
disa'eeable but injurious. 



CARING F[»R INVALIDS. 143 

One of the most important essentials in a sick room is 
perfcct clanliness of the room, the bed linen and cloth- 
ing of the patient, lTevêr air or dry cloths or gannents 
in the sick room. Covr the broom with a damp flannel 
cloth in swping, so as to avoid noise and prçvcnt the 
dust from rising. Avoid noise in placing coal on the 
tire by putting the coal in  paper bag, placing bag and 
ail upon the tire. Do hOt allow loud talking or discus- 
sion in the sick rooln ; neithr is whispering dcsirable, as 
it is apt fo irritate the patient. Do hot consult the 
patient about the food, but see that tempting, whole- 
some varieties are provided, in accor, lance with the 
doctor's ordrs concerning the diet. Sel've food in small 
quantitis, and eit]mr hot or cold, as the article may 
require. A warm dish which should be hot, and a tepid 
drink, or food, which shouhl be col,l, is one of the most 
objectionable and unappetizing forms of scrving food. 
Do not allow fresh fruit, which is intended for the 
patient, to remain in the sick room, but keep in a cool 
place and serve when needed. Never visit a sick room 
when in a olent perspiration or with an empty stomach, 
as the system at that time is nore susceptible fo con- 
taon. 
One of the most important qualifications in  nurse is 
a thorough knowle,lge of the nature, use and digesti- 
bility, as wll as the best methods of preparing the 
different kinds of food, so as fo adapt them to the 
different f«)rms of disease. In some cases, when the 
system bas been overtaxed, either mentally or physi- 
cally, a complete test is necessary, and the diet should be 
food which mrely satisfies the hunger--neither stimu- 
lating nor especially nourishing. Such foods colne under 



the head of gruels, soups, jellies, fruit and drinks. On 
the other hand when a patient has become wasted from 
a long continued illness and requires building up, more 
nourishment is required to supply the waste. In some 
cases the food must be given in concentrated form. Milk 
is one of the most valuable foods in this class; some- 
rimes if requires the addition- of a little pepsin in order 
to facilitate digestion ; sometimes the addition of a pinch 
of salt makes milk hot only more agreeable to the 
patient, but aids digestion. Eggs, either lightly boiled 
or in e¢(- n_,- are easily digested and very nourishing. 
Meat and milk soups, farina and oatmeal oTuel, port 
wine jclly, alhumen an, l milk (which is the white of egg 
and milk shaken together), and in some cuses a bit of 
carefully broiled steak or chop, with dry toast, are suit- 
able foods for this class of patient. In convalescence, 
any well cooked, easily digested food may be given. 
Fried food, rich puddins and pastry must be careful]y 
avoide,1. 
People with consumptive tendencies should eat whole- 
some, easily digeste,l food, with plenty of fat, such as 
cream, butter, fat of bacon and of roast beef, nmtton, 
olive oil, salads, cornmeal and cereals, and take plenty of 
outdoor exercise. Soups which bave in them cream or 
milk are better for invalids than those containing a 
grvater amount of gelatine. A fev simple recipes are 
given, which are suitable for invalids. 

]EVERAGES.

boil for 20 minutes closely covered. Strain and sweeten, 
and flavor with lemon juice ; a little lemon peel may bc 
added while boiling if desired. 
Apple Wate'.--Take 2 or 3 fart apples. Aftcr baking, 
put them in a bowl and pour over thcm 1 cup of 
boiling water, strain and sweeten fo faste; serve when 
cold. 
Flax Seexl Tea.--One-half cupful of flax seed--which 
has been carefully washcd in cold water--to 1 quart 
of boiling vater; boil slowly 30 minutes, move fo the 
back of the stove a,d allow if to remain l0 or 15 
minutes longer. Strain, and flavor fo faste with lemon 
juice and sugar. 
JLemonade.--Slice 1 lemon, add 1 tablespoonful «d sugar, 
press the lemon and sugar, a,I,l 1 cup of boiling water. 
Strain and serve hot or eold as required. 
Orange Water.--Made the saine as lemonade.

Beef T«a.--Cut juicy pieces of steak--the round steak 
is the best--into small pieces, cover with col,1 watcr and 
heat gradually fo 160 F. Allow it to remain at this 
temperature 10 or 15 minutes. Press, strain, and flavor 
with sal and pepper.

Beef Tea (IVo. 2).--Put a pound of finely minced beef 
into a glms fruit jar, add a pint of cold water. Let it 
stand for an hour, stirring and pressing occasionally. 
Place the jar in a kettle of water; place over the tire 
ald allov the water fo reach boiling point. Move back 
where the water will just simmcr for an hour, keeping 
the jar closely covered. Strain the beef tea through a 
fine wire straiuer; allowing the fine sediment to pass 
through, which should be drunk with the li«luid. Flavor 
with sait. (For an especially strong beef stimulant, see 
reciI»e for Bouillon, in a former cl»apter.) 
Bee.fE.sence.--(This method is highly recommended.) 
One ounce of finely chopped fresh beef, free from fat; 
pour over it 8 ounces of soft water, add 5 or 6 drops of 
dilute hydrochloric acid, and 50 or 60 grains of common 
salt, stir well, and leave for 3 hours in a cool place. 
Strain the fluid throu£,h a hair sieve, pressing the meat 
slightly ; a«l,ling gradually toward the end of the strain- 
ing, 2 ouaces of watcr. The li,luid is of  bright red 
color, tasting like soup. It should be sêrved cold, in a 
small quantity at a time. If preferred warm it must hot 
be put on the tire, but heated in a covered vessel placed 
in hot water. 
(iclcen Broth.--Singe an,1 clean a small chicken. 
One-half of the chicken may be used fl»r broth, and the 
other hall for broiling or a fricassee. Disjoint, and cut the 
meat into small pieces. Break or crush the bones. Dip 
the feet into boiling water and scald until the skin and 
nai]s will peel off (as the feet contain gelatin). Cover the 
meat, feet md bones with cold water ; heat very slowly, 
and simmer till the meat is tender. A few minutes

before removing from the tire add sait and pepper to 
taste, also ½ tea.spoonful of sugar. Strain, and when c,»ol 
remove the fat. When needed, heat the necessary 
quantity, aud if desired very clcar add the shcll and 
white of 1 etc Let this boil slowly 3 or 4 minutes. 
Skim and strain through a fine cloth. A little lemc, n 
juice may be added to vary the flavor. This nay 
poured into small cups and kep in a cool place; or if 
the patient can take it some of the breast meat inay be 
cut iuto small pieces and moulded with it. If the broth 
is served hot, it should hot be cleared with the egg. 
_lwttoez B roth.--Chop 1 pound of lean,j uicy mutton very 
fine; pour over it 1 pint of cold water. Let it stand 
until the water is very red, then heat it slowly. Allow 
it to simmer 10 minutes. Strain, season, and if liked 
thick, 2 tablespoonfuls of sort boiled rice may be ad,led : 
,»rit may be tlfickened with a little cornstarch wet with 
cold water and stirred into the hot broth. Serve very 
hot. If there is hot enough rime fo cool the broth and re- 
heat, the fat nmy be removed by using a picce of tissue, 
coarse brown or blotting paper, which, by passing over 
the surface, will remove any fat which cannot be taken 
off with a spoon. 
Oatneal Gruel.--To 1 quart of boiling water add 2 
tablespoonfuls of oatmeal, salt fo taste. ]3oil 1 hour, 
strain and serve with or without milk. Another method 
is fo cover the oatmeal with cold water. Stir well; let 
it settle, then pour off the mealy water into a saucepan. 
Then boil the water. 
Egg Soup.--Put 1 ounce c,f sago with ½ pint of milk 
into a double boiler, and cook 20 minutes. Strain 



through a sieve and add ½ pint of beef extract (or 
Bouillon). When hot take it from the tire and stir 
gradually into it the yolks (well beaten) of 2 egc,s. eason 
to taste, and serve. Chicken or mutton broth may be used. 
Albznvn ad Millc.--Put the white of 1 egg into  
pint of milk. Pour into a pint fruit jar, screw on the top 
tightly and shake well for 1 minute, when it should be 
light and smooth. Serve at once. A pinch of sait may 
be added if desired. 
Egg-.Vog.Beat 1 egg until very light, add 2 teaspoon- 
fuls of sugar, and beat again; add  cup of colà milk, 
mix well, and if ordered, 2 teaspoonfuls of brandy may 
be added. A pinch of salt adde, l fo the yolk of the egg 
makes it more pa]atable. 
O'age Soup.--Soak the juice of an orange, ] of the 
rated tin,I, and 1 teaspoonful of lemon juice for ½ bout. 
,train, and make the li,luid up to a cupful with water. 
Bring fo boiling point and adà two level tespoonfuls of 
arrowroot, moistened with a very little cold water, stir- 
ring constantly until iL thickens. When it reaches the 
boiling point, add 1 tablespoonful of sugar, turn into a 
h,wl and stand away fo cool. Serve very cold. (Any 
tart fruit juice may be used for this soup.) 
Arrou'root Grel.Dissolve 2 level teasioonfuls of 
arrowroot in a little cold water, add 1 cap of boiling 
water, cook for a few secon«ls; take from the tire, add a 
tablespoonful of su-tr, 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice. 
{One egg may be beaten, white and yo]k separately, until 
very light, mix them carefully and pour over the egg 
slowly one pint of hot arrowroot gruel, ruade as above; 
stir until well mixed.)

A FEW GENERAL HINTS FOR SCHOOL 
CHILDREN. 
"Too much attention cannot be ,iven by parents fo the 
,liet of school chi]dren, or by teachers to the diet of 
pupils under their care in boar,|ing schools and colleges. 
The average age of school children is from six to sixteen 
years. During this time both mind and body are 
undergoing development. Throughout school period the 
growth of the body is continued until almost completed. 
There are unusual demands, therefore, upon the functions 
of absorption and assimilation. The food must be 
abundant, and of the character fo furnish new tissue, and 
to yield ener,- in the fc)rm of heat and muscu]ar activity. 
The food shoul,1 also contaln salts of lime fo meet the 
requirements of formation of the bones and teeth. Many 
children acquire habits of dislike for certain articles of 
food, which become so fixed in later life that they find it 
very inconvenient, especially vhen placed in circum- 
stances, as in travelling, where one cannot always obtain 
the accustomed diet; if therefore is unwise to cultivate 
such habits, which are often a serious obstacle fo normal 
development. 



GE.ERAL HINTS FOR 8CHO(}L CHILDREN. 151 

" A physician is often baffted in the treatment of a 
severe disease by the vitiated taste of the patient, lIany 
cases of anoemi« and chlorosis, which are so commonly 
seen in youJg girls, are directly traccab]e fo a faulty 
diet. It should be the imperative duty of all teachers 
to cousider the responsibility of rightly developing the 
physical constitutions of those etrusted fo their care. 
They should relnember that the mind keeps on develop- 
ing long fter the body, and tha the period under 
discussion is one in which the constitution of the 
idividual is e/stablished f,»r the -emainder of lire. At 
this stage success in digesti«»n ad assimilation is of 
greater importance than success in ment«d attainments." 
(Thompson.) 
A impooEant consideration in school diet is to avoid 
monotony, which becomes so common from economic 
reasous, or more oft,_.n from carclessness. It is so much 
easler to yield to routine and force of habit than to study 
the question. The 1,ours for sîu, ly and for neals should 
be so regulated that sufflcicnt rime will be allowed 
before eacl nmrl for children to wash and 1)repare them- 
selves comfortably without going fo the table excited by 
hurry, aud they should be required fo remain at the table 
for a fixed rime, and no allowed to hastily swallow their 
food in order fo complete au unfiished task or gaine. 
An interval of af 1,'ast hall an hour should intervene 
after meals before an S- mental exertion is required. Con- 
stant nibbling af food betveen meals should be forbidden ; 
i destr,»ys he ai)petite, iicreases the sali,ca, and inter- 
feres with gastric digestion.

sentence and for ifs effect upon the muscles and nerves. 
It is being more and more rea|ized by the public in 
general, that the brcaking down of health af school is 
more often due to impovershed nutrition than to over- 
work. Delicate chihlren should hot be allowed too long 
],terva|s between meals, as-for instance, the evening 
meal at six o'c|ock and breakfast the following morning 
at seven or half past. A g|ass of milk and  piece of 
whole wheat bread and butter should be givenif they 
awakendurng the night De|icate cM|dren whose 
api»tites are poor, and who do hot do proper justice to 
their r-u]ar meals, should be ven an extra, al]owance 
of hot broth or hot milk wth bread anti butter, between 
nlea]s. 
The_se rulcs are ai»plicable in cases of children who, 
dur]ng one or two years, seem to develop with extraordin- 
ary rapdity, «rowng sometimes two inches or more in 
six months. The d_mands of this rapid growth must be 
mt by proper nutrition, or serious subsecluent impair- 
ment of vitality may result. Such children shoulcl have 
thcir meals ruade tempting by good cooking and pleasant 
vaiety, as well as an aTeeab|e appearance of the food. 
M,_at -hich is carved in unsightly masses and vegetables 
wh]ch are sodden and tasteless will be refused, and an 
i|| attemlt is ruade to supply the deficency in proler 
f,o:l by eating indigestible candy, nuts, etc. Children 
often have no natural l-lSng for meat, and prefer 
puddings, pastry or sweets when they can obtai them ; 
]t is therefore more important that meat and other 
who|esome foods should be made attractive to them at 
the age when they need it.

DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

INFANTS' DIET. 
One of the most important subjects included in a 
domestic science course of study is the feeding and cre 
of infants. A subject requiring specil intelligence and 
c«nsideration ; one which embodies the condensed infor- 
mntion of the pr,ceding chapters, and is the foundution 
upon which the future physical structure is built. 
Itis not upon the mother alone thnt the bnby depends 
for care ami attention. Many young girls, especia]]y 
clder sisters and nurse-maids, bave this responsibility 
[)|tced upon them when they are litt]e more than 
chihlren tiemselves. To tlese, as well as t young 
mothcrs, the following suggestions may prove helpful. 
T|le first demand of an infant is for food, and upon 
the Tality and «luantity of the atoEicle provided dçpends 
the hcalth of the child, as well as the comfort of the 
household. 
:Milk is the on]y food required by an infant until it is, 
af least, sevcu «»r eight months ohl, or until sufficient 
salivais secreted to assist digestion; some authorities 
say one year, others until the chi]d has sufficient teeth 
with w]Sch to masticate food. If nature's supply is 
hot avai]able, or sufficient, the best substitute is cow's 
milk. As cow's milk contains less sugar of milk, and 
fat (cream), than ||uman milk, these must be supplied. 
Being more acid than alkaline, this must be corrected by 
the use of lime water. 
There is more casein (curd)in cow's milk than in 
mother's milk, therefor,,  water musb be addcd to reduce 
this. The fo]lowing proportions bave been submitted as 

III 



INFANTS' DIET. 157 

a digestible form of preparing cow's milk for young 
infants (Dr. Meigs):-- 
Cream, 2 tbsps. I Lime water, 2 tbsps. 
Milk, I tbsp. I Milk-sugar water, 3 tbsps. 
One quarter of this amount fo be given every two 
hours during the day, and once or twice af night. 
Aftcr the baby is a week old, the quantity lnay be 
increased to one-half af each meal; af two months the 
whole amount prepared may be given at once. 
The proportion of milk should be gradually increased, 
and the water and cream decreased, until af two months 
old the proportion should be :-- 
3 tbsps, milk. I 1 tbsp. lime water. 
1 tbsp. creaoE I 3 tbsps, sugar water. 
Vhen six months old the quantity of milk is doubled. 
It should be increased every day until ten tablespoonfuls 
are given af a feeding. 
BARLEY WATER. 
2 tbsps, pearl barley. ] 1 pt. boiling water. 
Wash the barley carefully. Pour over it the boiling 
watcr. Let if simmer for two hours. Strain and sweeten 
with a pinch of sugar of milk. 
MILK-SUGAB" WATER. 
 oz. sugar of milk. [  pt. boiling water. 
Diolve, and keep cloly covere& It will not keep 
long, so should be ruade when required to use. 
LIME WATER. 
Take a lump of lime weighing about one ounce. Put 
in a bottle with a quart of cold water (wh]ch has been 



158 ................ . 

boiled). Shake the bottle well until the lime is dissolved, 
and let if stand ïor 12 hours. Pour the clear liquid into 
another bottle, being careïul hot fo «listurb the sediment. 
Keep carefully corked. Water will only absorb  certain 
quantity o[ lime, so there is no danger o[ its being too 
strong. 
As cow's milk is more difflcult to digest than mother's 
milk, it is sometimes necessary to substitute barley water 
in place of the lime water nd milk, using the same 
amount of cream as given in recipe. 

3IALTED :FOOD. 
2 oz. wheat flour or barley meal. I l tsp. extract of malt. 
1 qts. water. 
3Ii the flour to  pste with  little water, gradully 
add  quart of the water; put it in  double boiler and 
boil 10 minutes. Dissolve the malt extract in 4 tbsps. 
of the waer (coldç. Lift out the inner vessel and dd 
the malt and rcmainder of the cold water. Lt it 
stand 15 minutes, replace, and boil again ïor 15 nfinutes. 
Strain through  wire guze strainer. (ttalf this 
quantity may be malle.) 
This I)repartion is used when both barley water and 
lime-xvater disagree. It must always be given with 
milk. It prevents the large tou,.:h curds forming, which 
is such an objectionable feature in using cow's milk, 

PEPTONIZED IILK. 

In cases of especia|ly weak digstion it may be neces- 
sary to peptonize the milk, whieh may be donc as 
follows: Add 5 grains of extraet of panereas and 1.5 



INFANTS' DIET. 159 

grains of baking soda to 1 pint of lnilk. (Tablets of 
panereatin and soda may be use&) 
Mter adding the peptonizing material put tlle lni|k in 
a double boiler or in a vessel whieh may be set in a larger 
one, holding water, as hot as the hand tan bear being 
dipped into quiekly, or about 115 ° Fah. L,.ave the lnilk 
in the hol; water about 20 minutes, then place on the iee. 
If heaed too long the milk will taste bitter. 
The preparation given in reeipe No. 1, or with the 
barley water added, lllll.y be peptonize,l.

Put the amount of milk re,luired for a meal into pint 
or half pint bottles, allowing f,,r the number of times 
the ehild is to be fed in 24, hours. Use eotton batting 
as a stopper. Place a wire frame, or invert a pel-f«»rated 
tin pie plate, in the bottom of a saueepan; stand the 
bottles on this, pour around them enough water to corne 
well above the milk, eover the saueepan or kettle, and 
when the water b,ils lift the saueepan from the tire and 
allow the bottles to remain in the hot water for 1 hour. 
Keep in the iee box or sand them in eold water until 
needed. If milk is to be use,l during a long journey it 
will be neeessary to repeat the above operation three 
times, letting the milk cool between eaeh rime. 
Unless the milk is perfeetly fresh, and has been 
handled with great eare, it is safer to sterilize or pasteur- 
ize it. The f,rmer, if any doubt is enteoEaind as to the 
quality of the milk, the latter in every case.

TEMPERATURE OF FOOD. 
Food should be " milk varm," or about 99 ° Fah., when 
ven to a baby. Hot food is very injurious.

the mnount for an older child. This may be prcpare,l 
the saine nmnner as cornstarch or flour. The lon boil- 
ing converts thc starch into dextrine, which is more easily 
digested than starch. This is especially valuable in ca.cs 
of dirrh«a, and may be used instead of brley grucl as 
 food.

When milk cannot bc taken, albuminize, l food proves 
an excellent substitute. 
Shake the white of 1 egg with   pint of water 
(filtered or boile«l and cooled)in  glass jar until they 
are thoroughly mixed. Add  few grains of salt. 
Chi]dren do hot require  grcat variety in their food. 
Give one article of diet at a time and sce how if agrces 
before trying another. 
After a chi],l is a year old the various cerea]s may be 
giron as porridge instead of gruel, with the addition of a 
little sugar. 
Remember, all cereals should be thoroughly cooked 
(see page 83). 
]ISCUITS. 
G]uten, soda, oatmeal or Graham biscuits nmy be 
soaked in milk or given a]one. Do hot give the fancy

Junket is much better for young children than 
custards or puddings, and sometimes aoTees wel| with

BAKED POTATOES. 

Potatoes should not be/ziven fo a child under 2 years 
old in any other form than baked. The potash salts are 
the most valuable constituent, and are lost when they 
are peeled and boiled They should be dry and mealy. 
A little salt, lmtter or cream should be added. 

_IA CA_RONI. 
(See pe,je 85.) 
hlacaroni is an excellent foo, l for young children. 

FRUIT. 
Baked apples and the juice of an orange are the only 
fruits which should be given to children under two yers 
of age. 
I ICE. 
Rice is an excellent food for young children, but not 
for infants. 
VENTILATI(N. 
Foul air is injurious fo gown persons, but if is in- 
finitely more dangerous to the sensitive organization of a 
child. Therefore special attention should be given fo the 
ventilation of rooms occupied by a baby (see page 132). 
Fresh air, wholesome food, regular bathing, and lvlenty 
(:ï sleep will insure the normal growth of the average 
baby, and are within reach of every one who bas the 
care of young chikh'en. 



]  DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

The ,,vriter is indebted fo Miss Scovil, Superintendent 
of Newport Hospital, and one of the associate editors of 
the Z.ds' Home Jourd, for many of the above hints 
concerning the «]]et of nfants. 
EMERGENCIES. 
As frequent accidents occur during the performance of 
household duties, a few sugffestions as to how slight 
injuries should be treated may prove useful to the 
yOllng ]tmsekecper. 
Cu«.--A cut shou]d be washed with cold wter, 
covered with a small pari of cotton, bound up, and left 
alone. Shoul,l matter f»rll2, the bandage nmst be taken 
off, thc woun,l bathed with carbolized water, 1-80, and a 
]ittlc. carb,lizcd vaseline sprca, l on a bit »f linen and laid 
ox»_r it. The washing and dressitg shoul,l be repeated 
two or three times a day if thc're is much discharge. 
Bc_i.e«.--A flannel wrung out of vcry hot water, and 
laid on a bruise, relieves the soreness. 
For bruises on the face, apply ice. ]3rown paper wet 
in vimîgar is an old-fasMoned rcmedy. If the skin is 
broken, treat as a wound, with carbolized water and 
carbolized vaseline. 
,pr« is.--Both hot and cold treatment is recommend- 
ed. Immerse the joint in water as hot as can be borne. 
Keep up the temperature by gradually adding more hot 
watcr. ]Let if soak for an hour or more. Then -rap in 
warm flamel, and sxuround witla hot water bags or bottles. 
Stlngs.--]3athe the part in ammonia, or baking soda 
and water; wet a cloth in the saine, and bind over it. 
Be'.,s.--The best houselaold remedies for burns are 
ba'king soda and carbolized vaseline. For slight burns 



LN'FANTS' DIET. ] 6 

mlx the soda to a 1,aste with water, and sprea, l thickly 
over the part ; cover with linen or old cotton. This may 
be kcpt wet by S, lueezing water ov_.r if. If shreds of 
clothing adhere to a burn, they should be soaked with 
oil, and hot pulled off until softencd. If the skin is 
gone, spread carbolized vaseline on linen, and bind on 
the part until the doctor arrives. 
In burns causcd by acids, water shouhl hot be applied 
to the parts. Cover with dry baking soda. 
If caused by an alkali, such as lye, ammonia, or quick- 
lime, use an acid, as vinegar or lemon juice, diluted. 
Poisonig.--For poison ivy, saturate a cl-th in a 
solution of baking soda, or alnmonia and vater, and lay 
over the part. 
When poison has been swalloxved, the first thing fo do 
is to get it out of the stomach. Secon,lly, fo prevent 
what relnains from doing more mischief. Give an 
emetic tt once. One tbsp. of salt in a glass of tepid 
water; 1 tsp. of mustard, or 1 tsp. of powdered alum in 
a glass of tepid water. A tsp. of wine of ipecac, followed 
by varm water. Repeat any of these three or tirer rimes if 
necessary. The quantities given are for children ; larger 
doses may be given to a, lults. Itis well fo give a dose 
of castor oil after the danger is over, fo carry off any 
remnants of the poison that may have lodged in the 
intestines. 
After a poison hes burned the mouth and throat, 
plenty of milk may be ven, also flour, arrowroot, or 
cornstarch gruel. 
For drowning and othcr serious accidents, see Public 
School Physiology.

FURNISHING A CLASS-R()OM. 
The furnishing of a class-room should be so complete 
that each pupil should be able fo attend to the appointed 
task without delay. The furniture should consist of a 
stove, or range, gas stove if more convenient, a hot water 
tank or boiler, sink, table (side), towel rack, 2 dozen 
chairs, or seats with tabler arms, a cupboard or kitchen 
"dresser" for table ware,  large cupboard or arrange- 
ment f,r l«ckers, in which caps, aprons, etc., should be 
kcpt, a large table--horseshoe shape is the most satis- 
factory--with drawers, and space for rolling pin, bread 
board, etc., underneath. The table should be large 
enough fo allow st least 2 ft. 6 in. for each pupil. 
Twenty pupils is the limit of a practice class. On the 
table shouhl be placed af regu]ar intervals, l 0 tas burners 
with ïrame. The teacher's table shou]d stand in the 
opening at the end of the table so that she may see each 
pupil while st work, and when demonstrating may be 
seen by each pupil. 
The following list of utensils will be found sufficient 
for practice work for a class of 20 pupils.

two or more pupils demonstrating the lesson under the 
supervision of the teacher, the pupils taking this duty in 
alten,ation. The ren,ainder of the class observe and 
take notes. 



FUIRNISHING A CLASS-ROOM. 169 

The cost of material is trifling. It should not average 
more than fifty cents per pupil per armure, and for a 
large number should average less than this amount. 
The Boston school kitchens are, many of them, fur- 
nished af a cost of from 8200 to 8300. A fait are_rage 
cost for Ontario should be about 8175. 



 70 DOMESTIC S('IE\'CE. 

PLANNING AND SERVING MEALS. 
During the last quarter of school work each pupil 
should subn,it a tsTical menu for breakfast, dinner and 
supper, allowi,g for a c,«'tain nun,ber of peop]e. Consider 
the occupation, an,l ve reasons for the ehoice oï food for 
eaeh lin.al. 
Ntate how long ig shoul,l take to prepare the meal, and 
gi'e the cost. Iusi.t up,,n wu-iety in menus, an, l request 
the pupil to describe hc, w the meal s]muhl be serve& 
Sy.«'t««m, neatncss and pl'omptness should be especially 
t.mphasized. Clean tble linon--no matter how coarse-- 
is p,)ssible for every on. A dish of fruit or flowers, if 
only a bunch of -een foliage, improres the appearance 
«»f the table. 
During the scho(»l course a special lesson shoul, l be 
devoted to setting the table and sewing meals, with and 
without a waitress, so as fo gdve a knowledge of how a 
meal should be served, no matter w]mt the pupil's posi- 
tion in lire may be or what part she may bave to perform. 
A FEw GENEI/AL HINTS ON SETTING THE T.BLE. 
Although every housekeeper has her own method for 
serving meals, a few general principles gov,îru all properly 
regulated service. When setting the table, cover first 
with a cs.nton-itannel or f_-lt c]oth, in or, h:r to prevent 
noise and protcct the table. Place each article in its pro- 
per place an,l n,t in a confused "jmnble." Sec that the 
tableclot]l is spread smoothly, that the corners are of 
equal length, that the crea--if the cloth bas been folded 
instead of rolledis exuctly in the centre. Place the 
fruit or ltowers in thc centre of thc rai)le. 



PLANNING AND SERVING ][EALS. 171 

For each person place knife, spoon an,1 glass on the 
right, fork and napkin on the left. Place the glass at the 
point of the knife. Turn (he e,lge of the knife towards 
the plate and the fok tines up, the spoon with the 
bowl up. If soup is fo be served, place a S«luare of bread 
or a roll on t,,p of the napkin or b,4ween the folds. Place 
the pepper and sait at the corners of thc table, unless 
indivi,hml salts are used, when thcy should be place,1 at 
the hem of the plates, where the dcss«.rt spoon nmy be 
plaeed--the handle towards the right--for eonvenienee. 
The general rule in serving simple family meMs, with 
or without a waitress, is for the hosh:ss to serve the I»r- 
ridge and coffee at breakfast ; the soup, salad and dessert 
at dinner, and pour the tea at the evcning meal. When 
luneheon is served in the middle of the day the hostess 
usually does the greater part of the s,.rving, as hmeheon 
is e, msidered to be the m»st informal meal of the day. 

,. FEw HINTS FoR WAITRESNES. 

Learn to move quickly an,l quietly. Ee scrupulously 
elean and nea.t in every detail of dress and habit. Before 
serving a meal sec that hands and finger nails are elean. 
Always have a fresh white apron ready to put on bote,re 
the meal is announeed. Look over the table and sec that 
everything is in ifs place b,fore announeing a meal. Fill 
the glasses with water either before the family enter the 
dining room or immediately after they are seated. Lift 
the eovers from hot dishcs and turn them over at once in 
order to prcvent the sh,am fron dropping on the eloth. 
Take the plate from the host or hostess, and place before 
eaeh person from the right side--keep the thumb well 



:1 '2 DOMESTIC SCIER'CE. 
under the plate. Wben psing anything from whlcla 
the pers«ms seated at table bclp themselves, such as 
vegetables, sauces, etc., always go to the left, so as to 
leave the right hand of the one fo be served free. Keep 
a watchful eye over the table and pass anything appar- 
ently required. 
Learn fo receive insLructions from the hosLess in an 
und,rtone. Do hot get excited and try fo do too man)- 
things at once. It is an accomplishment to be a good 
waitress, ms iç requires special refinement and deftness, 
which are scarcely compatible vith an untidy nature. 
\Vhen serviug meals without a waitress, the daughters 
of tbe house shou]d consider it their special privilege fo 
save the mother any annoyance or discomfort during the 
meal rime. /Vevcr allow dishes, which bave been used, 
fo accumulate on the table or allow the table to become 
,lisordere& As nmch of the food as possible should be 
placed on the table before the family are seated, and the 
plates or dishes r«moved at once after using. /Vo rnatter 
how simple the meal may be, every housekeeper should 
see that if is served neatly and on rime. Teachers may 
exercise a far-reaching influence in the refininff of home 
lire by impressing upon çhe pupils the importance of 
thesetoo often consideredminor matters, and by 
giving minute instructions in the setting of table and 
serving the meal. One carefully planned lrractice lesson 
will convey more knowledge of such matters çhan any 
number of lectures or pages of theory. 



CONSIDERATION OF bIENUS. 173 

CONSIDERATION OF MENUS. 
The following menus and analyses are taken from 
bulletin No. 74, prelr»red in the United States Experi- 
ment Stations, and are inserted so as to give some idea 
of the cost and relative value of various foods in com- 
bination. If mst be q'emembered tlat the prices givo

mene would be l«ss tl«n is gicen 
The more expensive m.nus bave bcen omitted. The 
writer of the article says 
"Ir planning a well balanced dict the following points 
must be considered 
(1) The use of any considerable amount of fat meat or 
starchy food should be oftet by the use of soine material 
rich in protein. Thus, if roast pork is to be eaten for 
dinner, veal, fish, or lean bêcf mighb well be eaten for 
breakfa.st or supper, or both. ]ean soup furnishcs a con- 
siderable amount of protein, while bouillon, consommé, 
and tomato soup are practically useless as a source of 
nutriment. Skim milk also furnishes I, rotein, with but 
vcry little accompanying fats and carbohydrates to 
increase the fuel value. 
(2) The use of lean meats or fish for all three meals 
would require the use of such foods as rice, tapioca, or 
cornstarch pudding, considerable quantities of sugar and 
butter, and more vegetables, in order fo furnish suflïcient 
fuel value. 
(3) Since flour, sugar, and butter or lard enter very 
largely into pastries and desserts, the larger the quan-

tities of these dishes that are consumed the larger does 
the fuel value tend fo become as compared with the

THE IENVS. 

To illustrate the ways in which milk nmy be combined 
with other food materials, to form daily dietaries with 
about the amount of pr«_,tein and the fuel value called 
for }»3" the standard for men af moderate muscular work, 
a few menus are/dven in the following pages. These 
laenus are intended to show hov approximatcly the saine 
nutritive value may be obtained by food combinations 
,liff,ring widely as regards the number, kind, and price of 
the food materials used to make n I) three daily meals. 
They also illustrate how the cost of the daily menu may 



CONSIDERATION (»F MENUS. 175 

vary greatly with the kind and variety of materials pur- 
chased, though the nutritive value remains the saine. 
These sample menus should hot, however, be regarded as 
in any sense "models" fo be followed in actual practice. 
The daily menus for any fami[y will necessarily wtry 
with 15he markeç supply, the season, and the rela15ive 
expensiveness of different food materials, as well as with 
the tastes and purse of the consumer.s. The l»oint to 
which we wish here t5o draw especial attention is that the 
prudent5 buyer of foods for fami]y consumption can 
afford t5o wholly neglec15 their nutritive value in making 
such purchases. 
With reference fo the following daily menus, several 
points must be definitely bonae in mind. (1) The 
amounts ffiven represen15 about5 what would be called 
for in a family equivalent fo four full-gTown men af 
ordinary manual labor, such as machinists, carpcnters, 
mill-workers, farmers, truckmen, etc., according fo the 
usually acceptd standards. Sedentary peop]e wou]d 
require somewhat h.ss than the amounts hcre given. (2) 
Children as a rule nay be considered as having "" moder- 
are nauscular exercise," and if may easily bc undcrstood 
that the 14-year-old boy eats as much as his f;rthcr who 
is engaged in business or professional occupation, both 
requiring, according t5o 15he ten15ative standard, 0.8 of the 
food needed by a man with moderate lnUscular work. 
(3) I15 is hOt assumed tha15 any housewife will find it con- 
renient5 fo follow exactly the proportions suggested in 
15he menus. The purpose is to shoxv her about what 
amotmts and proportions of food materials would give 
15he required nutrients. 
A family equivalent to four lnell having iittl muscu- 



176 DOMESTIC ,SCIENCE. 

lar exercise--i.e.,-men with sedentary occupation--would 
require but about 0.8 the quantities indicated in the fol- 
lowing menus. If wou]d be very doubtftfl, however, if 
they would eat proportionally less of every food material.

Ira these nenus the amount of milk has, as a rule, been 
taken as representing somewhere near tire average con- 
sumption. The amount of milk can be increaed in any 
of the menus given above either by substituting if to 
some extent for coffee or tea, or by using more milk and 
smaller quantifies of meats, butter or eggs. Rough]y 
speaking, 1 quart of whole milk could be substituted for 
half e pound of meat or eggs and the amount of nutrients 
woul,l be the saine, while a pint of milk would give as 
large a fuel value as 1½ ounees of butter, and in addi- 
tion considerable protein hot furnished by the latter. 
This replacement of meats by milk is illustrated in the 
following menu, in which  diet with a rather small 
quantity of milk is so changed as fo include a much larger 
amount. Thus for breakfast în the modified ration a plut 
and a half of milk is mude to take the place of half a 
pound of broiled steak. For dinner  quart of skim milk 
(or buttermilk)is oel]ed for, or a glss for each person 
unless some of it is used in the cooking. At the saine 
rime, 4 ounces less toast pork is required. In the saine 
way a glass of whole milk is allowed each person for 
supper, or the bread e_n be marie into milk toast and the 
most of the extrn milk used in this way. This allows the 
canned sMmon fo be reduced 6 ounces.

Menus VI and VII, following, are intended fo illustrate 
how nourishing food can be procured in sufficient quan- 
tifies and moderate variety af a cost of hOt over 16 cents 
per day. The cost to Lhe farmer would be much less, 
since these menus call for considerable amounts of milk, 



180 DOIIESTIC SCIENCE. 

which is hardly worth more than one-half or one-third 
as much on the ïarm as it costs in the towns and cities. 
Coffee has hot always been indicated, but can be intro- 
duced for any meal ai a cost of from ½ fo 1½ cents per 
cup, according fo how much coffee is used in making the 
infusion, and how much sugar, milk, and cream are added. 
Itis, of course, not importnt that eemh meal, or the 
total food of each indivi,lual day, should have just the 
right amount of nutrients, or that the proportions of 
protein and fuel ingredients should be exactly correct so 
as fo make the meal or day's diet well balanceoE The 
body is continually storing nutritive materials and using 
them. If is not dependent any day upon the food eaten 
that purticular dny. Hence an excess one day may be 
ruade up by a deficiency the next or vice ver'sa. Healthful 
nourishment requires simply that the nutrients as a 
whole, during longer or shorter periods, should be fitted 
to the actual needs of the body for use.

DISCUSSION OF THE 
These menus attempt to give, as nearly as convenient, 
the range-of food materials and the variety of combina- 
tion which might be round in the verage well-to-do 
household. Some of the menus re more varied and 
costly than others, ncl a few are ven showing the 
effect of the use of more milk, and also how  diet might 
easily become one-side& The quantities of the different 
foods used per mel will hot, if is believed, be round out 
of proportion to each other, though of course they will 
hot suit every family. The weights of ail materials, 



184 DOIESTIC 

meal and other cereals, ment, vegetables, etc., are for 
these substances a.s purchased. 
The calculation of the quaTtities of nutrients con- 
tained in the different foo, ls is based upon the average 
percentage composition of these materials. Inasmuch as 
the rats and carbohydrates are used simply a fuel they 
are hot shown in the menus, only the quantity of protein 
and the fuel value of the food being of interest. 
The cost of the different food materials must of neces- 
sity be more or less of a varying quantity, depending 
upon the season of the year, the character of the markets, 
large or small, city or country, etc. Of the more import- 
ant food mtterials the assumed priee per pound is as 
follows: Beef loin, 1 fo 25 cents; shoulder, 12 cents; 
round, 14 cents; chicken, 15 cents; mutton loin, 16 
cents; lamb leg, 9-0 cents; bacon, 16 cents; sausage, 10 
cents; milk, 3 cents (6 cents per quart); skim milk, l- 
cents (3 cents per quart); butter, 32 cents; cheese, 16 
cents; eggs, 16 cents (24 cents per dozen); flour and 
meal, 2 fo 3 cents ; cereals, 5 fo 8 cents ; bread, 4 cents; 
potatoes and other vegetables, 1½ cent (90 cents per 
bushel); bananas, abouç 8 cents (20 cents per dozen); 
oranges, about 7 cents (25 fo 40 cents per dozen) ; apples, 
1½ cent per pound (90 cents per bushel). 
It is probable that the above figures represent more 
nearly the average prices of the different food materiaLs 
in the e,steru part of the country than in the central 
and western portions, where meats, cereals, and many 
other products are somewhat cheaper. It is also fo be 
borne in mind that by observing the markets many food 
materials can be pu_rchased much cheaper than here 



CONSIDERATION OF ]IENUS. 185 

indicated, while on the other hand there may be rimes 
when they will be much more expensive. The choice of 
vegetables and fruits will naturally be governed by their 
abundance and cost. 

- Another point that must hOt be overlooked is that the 
quantities, and consequently the costs, here given are for 
four working men; thaç is fo say, men engaged in 
moderately hard muscular labor. Of course, different 
individuals diflr greatly in their needs for food. These 
figures express only general averages and are based upon. 
the besç information accessible. 

A FEW POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED IN PLANNING I[Eh_LS. 
Dietetic authorities advise people who are engaged in 
oetive muscular vork to partake of the more substantial 
meal in the middle of the day, leaving such articles of 
food as soup--which is a valuable stimulant after  day 
of hard work--fruit, cake, etc., for the evening meal, 
when the system is too much exhausted to digest the 
more concentrated fooda When men are obliged to take 
cold lunches in the middle of the day the housewife 
should see that the lunch basket contains the necessary 
nourishment in the form of cheese, cold meat, meat or 
fish sandiches, hard boiled eggs, a fish or vegetable 
salad, cold pork and beans, rice pudding, whole wheat 
bread and butter, a bottle of milk or st'ained tea or 
coffee, pie, doughnuts, etc. 
Remember, a man working in the open air or in a large 
building requires food which will hot oxidize too quickly, 
or in other words, food which will keep up the fuel and 
force necessary for his work. Supper in such cases 



]8 DOMESTIC SCIENCE. 

should consist of a good broth or well malle souv, and 
the lighter foods;but breakfasç and dinner should be 
more substantial. If is a question of economy fo provide 
suitable food for the wage-earner. The children may be 
equally well nourished on a less experLsive diet, such as 
whole wheat bread and butter, milk puddings, fruit, 
green vegetables, cerels, milk, and meat once a day. 
On the other hand the individual engaged in sedentary 
employment, such as book-keepîng, teahing, needlework, 
etc., should dine later in the day, as if leaves a longer 
interval for digestion, which is much slower when the 
individual is confined in a close office or work-room, and 
where little exercise is taken.* Care should be taken in 
planning meals for this class to avoid food which requires 
much oxygen, such as fresh pork, fried food, sausage, 
warm bread, pastry, griddle cakes, etc. The mid-day 
meal of a brain worker or business man should be light; 
a s,up, glass of milk (hot or cold), fruit, bread and butter, 
vegetable salad, a broiled chop or steak, etc., are suitable 
for luncheon. 
Special attention should be given to the diet of school 
childre (ee p. 153.) 
Students and children who are obliged fo study st 
night should, as a rule, take some light nourishment be- 
fore retiring ;  biscuit, a piece of bread and butter, or  
glass of hot milk, is sufficient. 
Young grls, who are employed in shops, factories, etc., 
frequently hurry away to their work in the morning 

 The teacher m,y make this clear by compuring the digestion of the 
two classes fo the action of the air upon coal in a range with the drafts 
open and clo$ed, the more rapid combustion, effect of oxygen, etc. 



CONSIDERATION OF IIENUS. 187 

without taking a substantiaI breakfast. It is needless fo 
say that such action is sure fo be followed by a physical 
breakdown. A glass of bob milk or an egg beaten and 
added fo a glass of milk will serve as an occasional sub- 
stitute for a more substantial nleal, but is n«»t enough to 
sustain active exercise for any length of rime. 
Another point fo consider in the planning of meals 
is economy of fuel. The thoughtful housekeeper will 
arrange fo bave food requiring long, slow cooking, such 
as stews, soup stock, bread, etc., and ironing done by the 
same fuel Broiling, toasting, omelets, etc., require a 
¢luick tire. If is in the careful consideration of details 
that economy in both food and fuel may be exercised.

SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS. 
In giving instruction in Domestic Science, the teacher 
must be careful to explain the meaning of any words 
used which the pupils would not be likely to understand ; 
for instance, oxidation, combustion, solubility, etc., and 
many of the terres used in the analysis, such as fermenta- 
tion, casein of milk, albumen, cellulose, etc. :In order fo 
keee the attention of Pul»ils fixed on a subject, frequent 
illustrations and comparisons should be ruade. 
Questioning is one of the best methods of riveting 
attention, and as every teacher has hot the faculty of 
asking questions,  few suggestive ones are given which

APPENDIX. 

Outlines Nos. I and II, for clas work, are contributed by Prof. 
Kinne, of Teachers' Co/lege, Columbi University, N . Y. City. 

OI_7I'LINE I. 
The following outline is offered as a tentative plan of 
work, for n average class of girls, in the highes grades 
of the Public school. The exc ortier of lessons depends 
in a measure on the skill and interes of the pupils, and 
the special dishes selected to illustrate a l,rinciple, upon 
the circumstances of the pupils, and upon the season of 
the year. 
If should be r.oted that beginning with the third 
lesson, there are four lessons on the cooking of carbo- 
hydrates ; then four on the cooking of nitrogenous foods; 
next the batters, combining the two, and introducing the 
use of fat, and so on. Itis the purpose of this arrange- 
ment to enforce the eflbcts produced by heat on the food 
principles, singly and in combination; to alternate the 
groups, so that there is a constant rcview of principles 
already established; and to give practical work of in- 
creasing difliculty. 
The course in cooking should be preceded by a few 
lessons in house-work; and af leaqt one on the care of 
the kitchen. Itis taken for granted that the lessons are 
accompanied by a study of food values, the cost of food, 
marketing, etc. 
1. Simple experimefits in combustion--to illustrate the 
structure of stoves and the care of such stoves Study

of the fuel and apparatus tobe used in the school 
kitchen; practice in using the apparatus; comparison 
with other apparatus. 
2. Utensils--what they are, of what materials, and 
why. It is well to bave pupils make a list in note-book 
of simple kitchen furnishing. 
Experiments with the boiling of water, in Florence 
flask, in tea-kettle, and in covered saucepan, using ther- 
mometer. Use of double boiler. Compare with boiling 
water the temperature of fat hot enough for frying, 
and al that of the oven. To illustrate the two latter, 
croutons may be ruade. 
3. Measuring--experiment with the cooking of starch 
in water: cornstarch pudding, or tapioca or sago jelly. 
Develop the idea of the effect of the boiling temperature 
on the starch grains, the bursting of the grains, and the 
change in flavor due to continued cooking. 
4. A cereal and a fruit,--say, baked apples. In the 
ceral, in addition to the starch, is the cooking of the 
woody fibre. Note in both cereal and fruit the flavors 
dcveloped by heat, the cooking being  continuation, as 
it were, of the rpening process. 
5. A starchy and a green vegetab!e; as, for instance, 
potatoes and cabbage. Here, again, are the two prin- 
ciples, cookery of starch and vegetable fibre; again the 
dvelopment of flavor by heat. Cookery of peas and 
beans would botter be deferred until the pupils are 
familiar with the effect of water on nitrogenous sub- 
stances. 
If time allows, a sauce may be ruade to serve with a 
vegetable, or this may be given in the next lesson-

6. Vegetable soups, without meat stock. This is in 
I)art a reviev lesson. Oi)i)ortunity is offered here for the 
study of proportions, several ingredients bcing used, how 
much vegetable pull) or juice fo how much liquid; how 
much thickening, and how much salt fo a quart of soui). 
7. Eggs. Experiments fo show the coagulating point 
of the white and yolk, followed by soft and hard cooking 
of eggs, and possibly  plain omelet. 
8. Eg and milk. 
9. Oysters. 
10. Fish. 
ll, 12, 13. Batters. In these three lessons study 
especially proportions, methods of mixing and baking. 
A good sequence of batters is the following: popovers, 
griddle cakes, muffins, and baking powder biscuit; or a 
sweet batter in the form of a plain cake may be given 

for sake of variety. 
14. Tender meat. 
15. Tender meat. 
18. Tough meat. 
19. Tough meat. 

1)an broiling and broiling. 
Roasting and making of gravy. 
Soui)s and stews. 
Soups and stews. 

Made dishes of meat can be given in these two lessons 

20. Beverages. 
21. Salads. 
22. Desserts. 
23. A breakfast. 
24. A luncheon. 
25. A dinner; or, ctinner and sut)per.

Other topics, in addition to these, or in plce of some 
of them; bacon, and trying out of fat; cheese dishes: 
canning and preservng; dishes for invalids; other 
desserts and ruade dishes. 
Ç.)UTLI NE II. 
This outline has been found proetical in a shor course 
where it wa advisable fo dve the pupils work in the 
preparation of simple mls. The plan can be followed 
in a longer course.
