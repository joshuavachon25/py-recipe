INTRODUenON 

'JV ^HANY and various are the cook books now 
^jS^^C on the market, but few, if any, are plain, 
practical, thorough, and complete enough 
for all-around use and everyday reference 
in farm homes — in families where plain 
tastes and limited means forbid extrav- 
agant or fancy culinary indulgences and the accompany- 
ing unnecessary expenditure of time and labor. 

This book is intended especially and primarily for 
farm cooks, though it will be found equally useful and 
helpful in the city kitchen where economy is an object. 
It is, of course, understood that country or farm house- 
keepers have many advantages their town sisters lack, 
such as fresh fruits, vegetables, poultry, eggs, milk, 
cream and butter, which naturally cannot always be had 
in city markets, where even inferior grades of produce are 
high priced. In the average farm kitchen such things 
are considered necessities, not luxuries, and are accepted 
quite as a matter of course. How true it is that blessings 
brighten when they take their flight, as many an ex- 
country housewife could testify! 

But in spite of the many advantages which the farm 
cook enjoys, it is a deplorable fact that poor cooks are 
not confined to city limits. It is a pity that there should 
be any poor cooks, in city or country, since the art of 
plain and wholesome cooking is an easy one to master 
and yet means so much in the life economy of worjcing 
people, who in turn are of the utmost importance in the 
grand scheme of life. 

Some women do not seem to realize that very 
intimate relations exist between their own kitchens and 
the despised .liquor saloons. Poor cooks have done 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



more to drive men to strong drink than all the female 
temperance lecturers in the world can ever hope to 
redeem. To accomplish the most effective work for 
the cause of temperance, health and happiness, it is 
therefore necessary that women should first of all learn 
how to properly prepare palatable and nourishing food 
which will so well satisfy the natural cravings of the 
average human stomach that artificial and harmful 
stimulants will not be required. We should eat intel- 
ligently. Food and drink are to the human machine 
what fuel and oil are to the mechanical. 

It is hoped that this little cook book will induce 
housewives to try an occasional change in their usual 
daily bill of fare. The introduction of- some variety will 
make the cook's work less monotonous and is likely to 
be appreciated by other members of the family as well. 

The editor of this unique little cook book begs the 
indulgence of all who may become possessed of a copy. 
She does not claim to ''know it all," and in this instance 
has confined herself chiefly to the task of picking out 
from among a million good recipes, kindly contributed 
by housekeeping readers, such as seemed the best and 
the most deserving of finding a place in the "Orange 
Judd Cook Book." 

A glance through the index will prove that there is 
no lack of variety, and every woman who is represented 
in this book with one or more recipes has reason to be 
proud of being found in such good company. 

The editor extends hearty thanks to each and every 
one for the kindly and intelligent co-operation which 
helped to make this book possible, and that in turn, it is 
hoped, will help out many sister cooks all over this broad 
land of ours, where the "Orange Judd" papers are wel- 
come visitors, when confronted with the problem, "what 
shall I cook, for a change?"

Soups, Stews and Qhowders 

ECIPES for soups and stews vary so much 
in small details that it may safely be said 
that no two cooks make any soup or stew 
ahke. Nevertheless, there are some funda- 
mental rules that cover this culinary branch, 
as well as all others. The following recipes 
present a nice variety, and any of them may be slightly 
altered to suit individual tastes. Good, palatable and 
nourishing soups and stews are as inexpensive as they are 
easy to prepare, and should be served frequently, especially 
during cold weather. When properly prepared they will 
not be refused by anyone blessed with normal tastes and 
hearty appetite. To say that your family does not like 
soup is to confess that you are not quite "up" to making 
soup as palatable as it might be, and this is a lack which 
the following recipes will help anyone to overcome. 

Vegetable Sonp I 

To 3 pts water add 3 large fresh tomatoes or an equal 
amount of canned tomatoes, 1 large potato, peeled and sliced, 1 
small carrot, peeled and cut very fine, a few tender cabbage 
leaves chopped fine, 2 small onions cut fine, salt to taste, 1 
heaping tablesp drippings or butter, and % teasp mixed celery 
and coriander seeds, with 1 bay leaf and 1 small pod red pep- 
per. One or 2 stalks of celery may be added. If liked. Boil 
until the vegetables are thoroughly cooked, adding a little boil- 
ing water occasionally, if necessary. — [Mrs. A. B. C, Tex. 

Vegetable Soup II

small, tender cabbage, 2 small carrots, 1 rutabaga, 1 parsnip, 
and 3 potatoes, all cut fine. Let boil gently about lU hours,

smooth in a little cold water. — [Mrs. W. J., Wis.

THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Beef Soup 

The best cuts for beef soup are from the rump, shoulder or 
plate, the latter being the cheaper grades of the sides and flank. 
Oxtails also make a strong, rich^soup, and lean meat is better 
than fat meat, greasy soup being unwholesome. Always cook 
a few beef or veal bones with the soup, and a little piece of beef 
liver the size of an egg imparts a delicious flavor, which, how- 
ever, cannot be recognized as liver. Soup requires long and 
slow boiling to extract the juice from the meat. If boiled too 
hard, the meat will be hard and tough and will not yield its 
juices. Put the meat and bone on with cold water, and when 
it comes to a boil, skim carefully and do not add salt until 
after you are through skimming. For 1 lb meat, allow 1 qt 
water, 1 small onion, a small stalk of celery, sprig of parsley, 
and 1 teasp rice may be added. If liked, or 1 small potato. 
Oxtails should be chopped into pieces and boiled 4 or 5 hours. 
If it should become necessary to add water to the soup while 
boiling, add boiling water, as the addition of lukewarm or cold 
water will stop the boiling and spoil the flavor. Be very care- 
ful not to over-salt. Before serving, strain the soup througk 
a fine sieve. This soup is nice to serve clear, or to use as a 
foundation stock for other soups. — [Mrs. G., Wis. 

Beef and Tomato Soup 

Boil a good soup bone in about 1 gal cold water, with salt to 
taste, until the meat is nearly tender. Then add 1 pt tomatoes, 
V2 cup rice and 1 pt sliced potatoes, with 2 or 3 stalks of celery 
and a small onion, cut fine. — [B. O., Kan. 

Veal Soup 

Boil a veal bone about 3 hours, with potatoes, celery, onions 
and any other vegtable desired, but nothing acid, like toma- 
toes. When the vegetables are tender, strain the soup and let 
it come to a boil, and when ready to serve, add 1 pt milk and 
2 well-beaten eggs. — [A. H. B., Mich. 

Mutton Soup with Tapioca 

Put about 3 lbs mutton with as much bone in 4 qts of water, 
and let simmer at least 5 hours. Then strain and cool, remove 
layer of fat, and return broth to the fire. Add 1 onion, 2 small 
carrots, 1 small turnip and 2 stalks celery, all cut fine, and boil 
until vegetables are very tender. Have ready 4 tablesp tapioca 
soaked in cold water, stir this gradually into the soup, and boil 
10 minutes longer. — [M. W. W., O. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Chicken and Bean Soup 

Clean and cut up a nice fat hen, and put on to boil in plenty 
cold water. Parboil 1 qt white beans, adding % teasp soda

to taste. — [Mrs. S. O., N. D. 

Cliicken and Rice Soup 

Cut a nice fat chicken in small pieces, cover well with cold 
water and add salt and 1 cup rice. Boil slowly until done, add- 
ing more water as needed. When nearly done, add a few noo- 
dles or dumplings and boil until done. — [Mrs. W. H. L., Ky. 

Giblet Soup 

The head, neck, feet, heart, stomach, lungs and liver of a 
chicken are often thrown away. If properly cleansed and pre- 
pared, they make a nourishing soup. Split the heads, pick ofC 
all feathers, and lay in salt water. Pour boiling water over the 
feet and pull off the skin. Wash the heart, clean stomach, 
lungs, liver and neck in cold water. For three sets giblets 
allow 3 pts water, and simmer gently 3 hours. When cold it 
will be like jelly. The soup should be salted to taste and fla- 
vored with a few peppercorns. — [I. A. G., N. Y. 

Five Minute Soup 

Cut some stale slices of bread into small dice. Heat some 
butter in a frying pan, and when hot fry the diced bread in this, 
and when nicely browned add hot milk according to the quan- 
tity of bread. Season with pepper and salt and serve as soon 
as it has boiled up once. This soup can be prepared in 5 min- 
utes — hence the name. — [I. A. G., N. Y, 

Salsify or Mock Oyster Soup 

"Wash and slice thin, enough salsify to make 1 pt and boil in 
3 pts water 20 minutes, then add 1 qt scalded milk, 2 tablesp 
butter blended with 1 tablesp flour and pepper and salt to 
taste. Serve with oyster crackers. — [Mrs. W. G. McH., Kan. 

Rivel Milk Soup 

Put on to boil 1 qt or more of milk, with a little water. Pre- 
pare egg rivels by taking some flour, a pinch of salt and 1 egg, 
and stirring them together until the mass forms into little 
"rivels," Add these to the boiling milk, salt to taste, and let 
boil until the rivels are done. — [Mrs. L. M., O.

work in all the flour possible. Turn out on floured board, roll 
very thin, cut into pieces and roll each piece as thin as a piece 
of paper. Let these pieces dry, but not long enough to become 
brittle. After they have dried, lay the pieces one on top of the 
other, roll up, and with a sharp knife, cut very thin slices from 
this roll. Toss the noodles lightly to separate them, let them 
dry, and store in well-covered tins or jars. — [A. G., ]\Tass. 

Egg Noodles 

To 2 well-beaten eggs add 1 cup sweet milk, a generous pinch 
of salt, and flour enough to make a stiff dough, sifted with 2 
level teasp baking powder. Roll thin like piecrust, and cut in 
strips like shoe strings. These are fine cooked in beef or 
chicken broth. — [Mrs. H. D. K. T., Minn. 

Croutons for Soup 

Trim slices of stale bread, cut into small cubes about ^/^ inch 
square, and brown in a moderate oven, or fry brown in hot 
butter. Especially nice to serve with chicken broth, bean soup

dumplings or noodles, and when done, serve at once. — [Mrs. 
S. P., Mass. 

Beef Stew 

Take about 7 or 8 lbs of beef from a low-priced cut — the 
lower part of the leg — and boil in enough water to cover, until 
the meat parts from the bone. Remove the bone, skim off the 
fat, and then add 8 potatoes, 1 small turnip and 4 onions, cut 
fine. When nearly done, add dumplings made from 1 pt flour, 
a little salt, % teasp soda, and sour milk enough to make a 
stiff batter that will drop from the spoon. Cook about 12 or 15 
minutes. — [M. L. Q., Me.

the proper consistency with a little flour and cold water stirred

Corned Beef Stew with Suet Dumplings

and tied with cord. Put the beef on to cook in hot water, and 
boil until tender, then add suet dumplings made as follows: To

required — salt pork, and either beef or chicken, preferably

and stir frequently until the meat and vegetables are thor- 
oughly done and the stew is of the consistency of thick cream. 
Serve with crisp soda crackers. For picnics this stew, in more 
generous quantities, is generally made over a gypsy fire in a 
large iron kettle, and the cook begins his preparations 10 or 12 
hours before the stew is to be served. — [Mrs. H. L., Va.

Pish, Shell^Pish and Qrustaceans 

ITCHEN lore has it that fish is good brain 
food. This is probably owing to the fact 
that fish contains all the elements of meat 
in an easily digested form, and is, therefore, 
more easily assimilated by the system and 
consequently especially good for people 
yoing brain work or following other sedentary occupations. 
As a matter of fact, good fish properly prepared is always 
■wholesome food for old and young, and particularly so in 
spring, after a season of "heavy" eating, as is usual in win- 
ter. The observance of Lent is therefore to be recom- 
mended, even to those who do not consider it a religious 
duty. The following recipes offer a nice variety in the way 
of fish food. 

To Can Fish 

Clean, scrape and wash fish thoroughly in plenty fresh water. 
Cut into pieces of convenient size, but do not remove large 
bones or skin — only fins, head, tail, etc. Have in readiness 
glass fruit jars perfectly clean and dry, with new rubbers 
and covers to fit air tight, put a little salt in the Dottom of the 
jars, dry the pieces of fish with a clean towel, then pack in a 
layer of fish, fill the crevices with salt, put in more fish and 
salt, and so continue until the jar is full, using no water. 
Pack down as solidly as possible. Screw the lids on lightly, 
then put the cans in a boiler the same as for canning fruit 
(see rules for canning), pour in cold water to within an inch 
of the tops of the cans, cover the boiler, bring the water slowly 
to a boil, and let boil steadily 3 or 4 hours. Do not le.t the 
water stop boiling, and do not let any steam escape. When 
done lift out one can at a time, screw the covers down as 
tightly as possible, and after all the covers are screwed down 
tight, return the cans to the boiler, pour in more boiling water, 
so as to fully cover the cans, then cover the boiler, and set it 
away to get cold. When cold take out each can carefully 
and turn each one on its head. Leave them standing thus 
about an hour, and if there is no leakage, brush melted paraf- 
fine around the edge of the lids, and set away ia a cold, dry 
and dark place. I also can meat this way, removing the bones 

11 



12 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

and adding spices to suit. Be sure to boil long enough, and be 
sure the cans are air tight. Last year I canned 70 qt jars of 
beef in two days, and did not lose a can. By simply heating it 
up, I can have fresh meat or fish any time. — [Mrs. A. A., 
Wash. 

To Salt and Smoke Fish 

Cut off the heads, tails and fins, but do not scale the fish. 
Split them along the backbone, and scrape them clean inside, 
but do not use water. Pack the fish solidly, using plenty of salt, 
in a good clean keg, or a large glass jar, put a clean cloth on 
top, an inverted plate and a weight, and set away in a cool 
place for 3 or 4 days. Then remove from the brine, wipe each 
piece of fish clean, and pack in another clean keg or jar with 
more salt, and cover and weight as before. The fish should 
always be well under brine. 

To smoke fish first clean them as directed above, pack them 
away in salt, and let them remain there about 48 hours, after 
which wipe dry, string 2 halves on a cord, so that they can 
be hung over a stick, and smoke in barrel or box, if you 
have no smoke house (directions how to make a barrel or box 
smoker are printed in the department of recipes for butcher- 
ing time), and smoke about ?, or 3 days. — [Mrs. C. B., Minn. 

To Remove Skin and Bones from Fish 

To remove skin cut off the fins along the back, and then a 
strip of skin less than ^^ inch wide down the full length 
of the back. Dip the fingers in salt, then loosen skin below 
the head and draw it off from one side by pulling gently with 
one hand and pushing with the back of a silver knife held 
in the other hand. To bone a fish begin at the tail on one 
side. Slip the knife in between the skin and the bone and 
carefully cleave the flesh from the bone its entire length. — 
[J. H. 

General Ways of Cooking Fish 

Fish may be boiled, baked, broiled, or fried. Red-blooded 
fish, as salmon, bluefish and mackerel, in which the fat is 
distributed throughout the fish, is better boiled, not fried in 
fat, but white-blooded fish, as cod, haddock, and halibut, in 
which the fat is concentrated in the liver, may be fried or 
baked. Salmon, which contains a large proportion of fat, is 
best cooked in boiling water. "When the white-blooded varie- 
ties are cooked in water they should be served with sauces, 
and when baked they should be basted often or they will be 
dry and tasteless. All fish should be thoroughly cooked, but 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 13 

if cooked too long fish loses it flavor. When boiling fish put it 
on In warm water, and add 1 teasp salt and 1 tablesp vinegar 
or lemon juice to each 2 qts water. If the fish were put on 
in cold water the juices would be extracted, and putting it on 
in boiling water causes the skin to contract and crack. 

Fish, that, when dressed, presents a flat surface, particularly 
those varieties in which oil is distributed throughout the 
flesh, as shad, biuefish and mackerel, are very nice broiled 
over a clear hot fire, but not too hot, or they will become 
hard and indigestible. Before broiling rub well with butter 
or oil. Fish may be baked whole or in large thick slices, and 
white-blooded fish should be basted frequently. Shad, halibut, 
salmon, biuefish, white fish and bass are very nice when baked. 
Baked fish is nice stuffed with any preferred dressing, but 
not too full. Cut gashes in the upper side of the fish and 
insert strips of salt pork. 

Small fish are most suitable for frying. After cleaning, 
washing and drying, season with salt and pepper, roll in 
flour, then in- beaten egg, and then in bread or cracker 
crumbs. See that every part of the fish is well covered with 
the egg and crumbs dressing, which forms a fat-proof cover- 
ing. The fat should be smoking hot and kept hot until the 
fish is done. After removing from the frying pan lay the fish 
on several layers of salted paper, to absorb the fat. — [J. H. 

To Freshen Salted Fish 

Cover the salted fish with plenty fresh, cold water, and put 
it on the back of the range to heat very gradually, and when 
the water is hot, pour it off, put on fresh cold water, and let 
it heat gradually once more. Then pour off the hot water, 
remove the skin and bones from the fish, and flake it with 
the fingers or a fork. Salt fish should never be boiled hard— 
always let it simmer slowly. — [Mrs. H. L., Va. 

Some Codfish Ways 

For boiled codfish select a nice thick piece of salted codfish 
and freshen it according to directions given elsewhere. Cover 
it for the third time with clear, cold water, and let it simmer 
slowly 3 or 4 hours, according to the size and thickness of 
the fish. Serve with butter gravy and baked potatoes. To 
make codfish balls use the freshened and flaked fish, or some 
left-over pieces of boiled fish, and mix with the same quan- 
tity of potatoes — raw potatoes sliced fine if the fish is raw, or 
mashed potatoes if the fish is boiled. If raw, boil until tender, 
then add 1 or 2 well-beaten eggs, a little piece of butter, and 
a very little cream or milk, with flour enough to shape into 
small balls. Fry brown on both sides in deep, hot fat. A 
very nice pudding can be made in the same way, by leaving 
out the flour and adding a little more eggs and milk. — [E. P., 
Mass. 



14 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Broiled Codfish 

Cut one-inch slices from the thick part of the codfish, ani 
soak them in fresli water to remove the extra salt. Boil until 
half done and then broil over a hot fire. Serve with small 
cubes of salt pork browned to a crisp. Potatoes ''boiled in 
their jackets'* are nice to serve with this fi^h dinner. — [F. !*> 
R.. Ct 

Codfish JLoaf 

Flake 2 cups cold, boiled codfish very fine. Prepare an 
equal quantity of highly seasoned mashed potatoes and mix 
well together while both are hot. Pry 1 tablesp minced 
onion in 2 tablesp butter until it yellows, then add 1 teasp 
mustard, a dash of cayenne pepper, and 1 tablesp lemon juice. 
Stir well, then add this sauce by degrees to the fish and potato 
mixture. Pour into a well buttered pudding dish, and bake 
^A hour.— [L. J. P., Ore. 

Codfish VFith Vegetables 

Flake a nice piece of cod, freshened and boiled, put a 
layer in a buttered pur? ding dish, then a layer of mashed pota- 
toes, then a layer of mashed parsnips, another layer of fish» 
and so on until all the fish and vegetables have been used; 
cover the top with cracker crumbs, dot with butter, pour in 
a little hot railk, and bake until the top is brown. Serve 
hot with egg sauce. This is a nice way to use up left-over 
fish, potatoes and vegetables. — [Mrs. E. P. P., Mass. 

Creamed Codfish 

To 1 lb codfish, freshened and flaked, add 1 tablesp butter 
creamed with 2 tablesp flour, 1 pt milk, and 1 cup boiling 
water. Let simmer slowly and when done serve with mashed 
potatoes. — [Mrs. H. L., Va. 

Codfish Fritters 

Boil some freshened and flaked codfish slowly for 10 or 15 
minutes, in water barely enough to cover, then strain dry and 
cool. Make a griddle batter of milk, eggs and flour, with a 
little salt and baking powder, stir in the drained, flaked cod- 
fish, and fry the fritters brown in deep hot fat. — [E. P. P., 
Mass» 

Codfish Soup 

To 1 pt strained tomatoes add 1 cup boiled and flaked cod« 
fish, 1 qt water, and a lump of butter. Boil 15 minutes, then 
add scant i/^ teasp soda, and while it is foamy, pour in 1 pt 
scalded milk. Serve at once. — [A. H. B., Mich. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 15 



Salt Mackerel 

Soak fish in cold water 24 hours, then drain, cover witti 
water, add 1 tablesp vinegar, and boil until tender. Serve 
on a hot platter with melted butter poured over it. — [Mrs. M. 
R., N. Y. 

Baked Pickled Mackerel 

Clean, scrape and wash small mackerels thoroughly. Prepare 
a mixture of 1 pt salt, 1 tablesp each ground cloves and all- 
spice, 1 heaping teasp pepper and a little ground celery seed. 
Roll mackerel in this mixture and pack in an earthen pot. 
Pill with cider vinegar, and bake slowly 4 or 5 hours. The 
above pickling mixture is enough for 25 small mackerels. This 
is an especially fine dish to serve in cold weather. — [A. R. W., 
Mass. 

Fried Salt Herring 

Wash the salt herrings in clear, cold water, in which a little 
soda has been dissolved, scrape off the scales, open and clean, 
and then cut clear down through the backbone. Wash the 
inside well, then lay the halves, cut side dov/n, in clear water, 
deep enough to cover, and let them remain there about 12 
hours, after which wash again, dry on a towel, sprinkle each 
piece with black pepper on the inside, fold, dip in cornmeal or 
flour, and fry over a hot fire in plenty hot lard. Nice served 
with com pones or hoe cakes. — [Mrs. H. L., Va. 

Pickled Herring: 

Freshen salted herring in clear cold water about 4 hours, 
changing water every hour. Cut in pieces of convenitmt size 
and put in a jar of vinegar with a few slices of raw onions and 
some whole spices. — [Miss M. C, N. D. 

Baked Pickled Herring 

Put a layer of fresh fish in a small, deep baking pan, sprinkle 
with salt, pepper, cinnamon, cloves and flour, dot with small 
bits of butter, and so proceed until the pan is full, then cover 
with good cider vinegar and bake about 3 hours. Can be 
sealed in air-tight jars, but would keep quite a long time in 
a cold place, even without sealing. — [Mrs. J. O. W., N. Y. 

Fresh Herring with Onions 

Prepare and wash the fish, remove heads, tails and fins, 
cut eaeh fish in halves down the back, remove the bones, and 



J 6 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



dry on a clean towel. Cut 2 onions fine and fry them about 
4 or 5 minutes in hot drippings, then dip each piece of herring 
in batter and fry with the onions, adding more hot fat if nec- 
essary. Fry about 8 or 10 minutes, then place the fish in the 
center of a hot platter, arrange the onions around them, and 
garnish with parsley. — [Mrs. E. P. C, Me. 

Directions for Baking Fish with Dressing 

Clean, scrape and thoroughly wash the fish, and then wipe 
dry on a clean towel. Sprinkle the inside of the fish lightly 
with salt, and fill with a dressing made of bread or cracker 
crumbs, a little butter or cubes of salt pork fried brown, a 
little minced onion, and pepper, salt and sage to taste. The 
flavoring is always a matter of taste. Skewer the fish with 
wooden toothpicks, or sew up, and put in a baking pan with 
1 or 2 cups of water, sprinkle the fish with a little salt and 
flour, dot with bits of butter, and bake slowly until done, 
basting frequently. Serve hot. If the fish is large a nice way 
is to cut several deep gashes on the bias across the top of the 
fish and insert thin stripes of salt pork or bacon in these 
gashes. It is sometimes difficult to remove a baked fish from 
the pan without breaking. A flat piece of perforated tin, 
put in the pan under the fish, will help to obviate this trouble. 
• — [A. G., Mass. 

Shad 

To bake a shad follow the directions for baked fish. The roe 
may be baked in the same pan with the fish. Baste frequently. 
If the fish is large it is well to rub in and outside with 
salt, let stand a while, and then wash in clear water. — [A. G., 
Mass. 

Steamed or Baked Halibut 

Clean and wash thoroughly and dry with a clean towel. 
Butter a colander or any perforated dish, put the fish in this 
and place the colander over a kettle of boiling water. Do not 
let the fish touch the water. Cover colander closely and 
steam about 1 hour, or until the fish is done. Turn out on a 
hot platter, pour melted butter over it, season with pepper 
and salt, and garnish with slices of lemon. Halibut is also 
nice baked with half water and half milk, filling the baking 
pan about I/2 inch, dotting the top with butter, and basting 
often. The gravy in the pan may be thickened with a little 
flour and served with the fish. Potatoes and lettuce are nice 
served with any fish. — [Mrs. E. P. C, Me.

Baked Fresh Salmon 

When I lived in Oregon a friend showed me how to bake 
fresh salmon, and I have never tasted anything more delicious. 
Wash and clean a small salmon thoroughly, in and outside, 
rub with butter, salt, and pepper, slice 1 onion, and put some 
of the slices in the fish and over the fish, and then pour 1 pt 
can of tomatoes over all. Bake in a moderate oven and baste 
frequently. Turn out on a hot platter and garnish with 
parsley. — [Mrs. E. G., Mich. 

Boiled Fresh Salmon 

Clean the fish thoroughly inside and out, put on in boiling

pieces of convenient size, put them in boiling hot water, a 
few at a time, and let cook only a few minutes. Drain and put 
a layer of the fish pieces in a jar, alternating with layers of 
onions and spices, until the jar is full. Cover with good cider 
vinegar, cold, and put on an inverted plate with a weight, 
cover the jar with paper and cloth, and set away in a cold 
place. In 2 or 3 weeks the fish will be pickled sufficiently for 
use. — [Mrs. F. M., Wash.

About Oysters and Clams 

Oysters, which are comparatively easy of digestion, though 
not very nutritious, are in season from September to May — 
that is, they are not considered good during May, June, July 
and August — the months without an "r." After removing 
from shell, 1 liquid qt contains about 50 small or medium 
sized oysters. To open oysters push a thin flat knife under 
the upper valve (the lower valve is deepest), and cut the 
muscle which holds the shells together. This muscle and the 
edges of the oysters are tough and indigestible and should 
be removed. Drain the liquor through a piece of cheesecloth 
wrung out of clear cold water, and carefully wash the oysters 
to remove grit or bits of shell. The harder parts of clams 
when cooked are quite indigestible and if not discarded ought 
to be chopped very fine. 

Better do without oysters or clams than risk buying them 
canned. Many cases of poisoning have resulted from eating 
canned oysters or clams that were not strictly fresh. It is 
safest to buy clams or oysters in the shell, and open them 
yourself, or have them opened by the dealer. When the 
shells open themselves the clams or oysters are dead and 
unfit for use. Clams and oysters should always be washed 
thoroughly, to free from grit. Long boiling toughens oysters 
• — they should boil only about 1 minute, or until the edges 
curl. Do not boil them in milk, but add the milk and salt 
just before serving. Oysters should be served immediately, 
as long standing toughens them. — [A. G., Mass. 

DcTiled Oysters 

Drain 2 doz oysters, chop fine, and mix with small i/^ loaf 
bread moistened with a little water. Season with salt, black 
pepper and a pinch of cayenne pepper, 1 tablesp butter, and a 
little finely chopped parsley. Fill cleaned oyster shells witk 
this mixture, sprinkle with cracker crumbs, and set in a brisk 
oven to brown. — [Mrs. G. T. D., La. 

Pickled Oysters 

Wash 4 doz large oysters and wipe dry; strain the liquor 
and add to it 1 teasp pepper, 2 blades of mace, 1 level tablesp 
salt, and 6 or 7 tablesp vinegar. Simmer the oysters in 
this liquor a few minutes, then skim them out and put them 
in a small jar. Boil the pickle a few minutes longer, skim, 
and when cold, pour it over the oysters. Have the jar 
overflowing full, and seal air tight. — [M. P., N. H.

Scalloped Oysters 

Have ready a buttered baking dish, some melted butter in a 
saucer and some fine cracker and bread crumbs mixed. Rinse 
and drain small oysters, lift each one on a fork, roll first in 
melted butter, and then in crumbs, and put in the baking dish. 
Cover the bottom of the dish with oysters treated this way, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper and a very, very little mace — be 
careful not to use too much. Fill the dish in this way, and 
then pour in about % cup strained oyster liquor and 2 tablesp 
cream. Cover the top with a thin layer of crumbs, dot with 
bits of butter, and bake in a hot oven about V2 hour. — [M. P., 
N. H. 

Baked Oysters 

Wash and drain 1 qt small oysters. Make a sauce of 1 cup 
strained oyster liquor, V2 cup milk and % cup each butter and 
flour. Season with 1 level teasp salt, a few dashes of pepper 
and 1 tablesp grated cheese. Add the cheese after the sauce 
has cooked 5 minutes, and remove from the fire as soon as the 
cheese is melted. Parboil the oysters in a little of their own 
liquor until the edges curl, then put them in the sauce pre- 
pared as directed above, turn all into a buttered baking dish, 
cover with 1 cup fine cracker crumbs, dot liberally with butter, 
and bake until the crumbs are brown. Parboil the oysters 
before making sauce, as the extra liquor will be needed. — < 
[M. P., N. H. 

Fried Oysters or Clams, and Fritters 

Wash, drain and dry oysters between clean cloths. Dip in 
beaten eggs, then in bread or cracker crumbs, and then in eggs 
and cracker crumbs again, seasoned with salt and pepper. 
Fry about 1 minute in deep, smoking hot fat. Drain on soft 
paper to absorb the grease, and serve at once. To make frit- 
ters dip the oysters in a batter made of flour, eggs and a little 
of the oyster liquor and salt. The oysters should be gener- 
ously covered with the batter. Fry quickly in deep, hot fat. 
Clams may be prepared the same way. — [A. G., Mass. 

Oyster Stew 

To 1 cup strained oyster liquor add y2 cup water, boil and 
skim, then add V2 teasp salt, i/4 teasp pepper, 1 tablesp butter 
and 1 tablesp fine cracker crumbs. When it boils add 1 qt 
oysters and boil 1 minute. Put % cup cream in a tureen, pour 
the boiling oyster stew in this, and serve at once. Do not cooi 
the oysters in milk, as that toughens them. — [E. K., Mass.

or 4 qts water, 6 potatoes, 6 onions, 3 carrots, i^ small tur- 
nip and % small head cabbage, all chopped fine. Let boil 
about 2 hours, then add about 1 qt tomatoes, 3 or 4 bay leaves, 
some celery salt or fresh celery, chopped fine, a little parsley 
and salt to taste. Boil until all the ingredients are well done, 
then add 1 or 2 qts clams, chopped fine, and a little of the 
liquor strained. Boil 15 or 20 minutes, and just before serv- 
ing add 1 qt hot milk, if liked. Serve with crisp crackers. — 
[A. G., Mass. 

Crabs and Ijobsters 

The natural color of a live, healthy lobster is usually a dark, 
mottled, bluish green, but in sandy regions sometimes 
slightly reddish, and when boiled the color of the lobster 
changes to red. Lobsters are most plentiful during April and 
May, and the average weight is from 2 to 5 lbs. Lobsters 
should always be bought alive (unless they are bought ready 
cooked), and cooked, at once, by plunging as quickly as possi- 
ble into a large kettleful of boiling and bubbling hot water, 
head first. Add about 1 tablesp salt, cover the kettle closely, 
and boil briskly 1 minute, and then simmer gently V2 hour. 
Hard shell crabs are treated the same way. To dress a crab 
or lobster remove the shell by cutting with scissors, leaving 
the white flesh whole, wherever possible, and discarding the 
intestinal vein and stomach. Lobster or crab meat, cut fine, is 
nice mixed with an equal amount of cream sauce. Soft shell 
crabs are usually fried. Dress carefully, dip in milk, season 
with salt and pepper, roll in flour or bread or cracker crumbs, 
and fry a golden brown in deep, hot fat. — [A. G., Mass. 



Frozen fish should be thawed out in cold water, and then 
cooked at once. — [A. G., Mass. 

Never salt oysters until just before removing from the fire, 
or they will shrivel and harden. — [S. E. W., O. 

The old fish rule is, "Always fry my belly brown before you 
turn my back down." This a good rule, as the fish will not 
break in pieces if fried this way. — [Mrs. M. R., N. Y. 

It is best to fry fish in pure olive oil, fresh lard comes next, 
and butter is the least desirable. Lemon juice or slices 
of lemon are generally served with fish, as the acid corrects 
and balances the strong, fishy taste. — [Mrs. E. J. G., Mass. 




Meat, Poultry and Game 

AINTY cookery can convert the cheaper cuts of 
meat and fowl that is anything but tender, into 
wholesome, appetizing and hearty dishes. If the 
housewife can do this, she has learned the trick 
of reducing the butcher's bill by half, without 
stinting the meat supply. Authorities claim that 
the cheaper cuts of beef when properly prepared are by far 
more nutritious than the fancy, high-priced cuts. The fol- 
lowing recipes include some very economical meat, poultry 
and game dishes, that sound decidedly **good," and by 
following the special directions for boiling and roasting, it 
ought not to be so difficult to get satisfactory results. The 
various recipes will also be found to be valuable aids in 
providing welcome variety for the dinner table, and though 
game is a rarity in most homes, yet these recipes will 
doubtless be appreciated too, when luck favors the hunter. 

General Directions for Boiling and Roasting Meat 

If meat is put on in cold water and salted at once the juices 
will be extracted, and therefore this method should be used 
only for soups or broths. Putting it on in boiling water will 
close the pores and form a coating which will help to retain 
the juices. Salt also helps to extract juices and therefore 
should not be added until the meat is almost done. Meat for 
roasting should be wiped dry and put in a hot pan with very 
hot fat, in a very hot oven, adding salt after the meat is half 
done. Pot roasts should likewise be put dry into very hot fat 
and browned on all sides before water is added. When roast- 
ing meat the heat of the oven can be slightly decreased after 
the first half hour. Pot roast should simmer slowly after the 
first half hour, as quick cooking toughens it. — [A. G., Mass. 

Boiled Beef with Dressing 

Put a piece of nicely trimmed beef in a kettle, and any pre- 
ferred dressing, sewed up in a cheese cloth bag. Add boiling 
water to cover, and boil until the meat is done. Thicken 
some of the stock with a little flour, and serve as gravy. The 



24 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

remainder of the stock can be used as a foundation for soup. 

If the meat is not fat enough add some butter to the dressing, 
and if the meat will require very long boiling, do not add the 
bag of dressing until the meat is half done, when salt may 
also be added. Onion added to the dressing or the liquor 
improves the flavor. — [Mrs. E. P. C, Me. 

Steamed Beef 

Trim a nice piece of beef, cut deep gashes into it, and insert 
strips of salt pork, tie with twine to keep in shape, then put 
in a lard pail, add 1 chopped onion and a little sage, if liked, 
but no water. Cover the pail tightly, and put it in an iron pot 
filled with boiling water, and boil steadily about 3 hours. 
Then open the pail, season the meat with salt and pepper, 
and fill nearly full with sliced raw potatoes. Cover the pail 
again and steam 3 hours longer. If inconvenient to use the top 
of the stove, the steaming can be done in the oven just as well, 
where it will only require 5 hours in all. — [Mrs. E. P. C, Me. 

To Cook Corned Beef 

Wash the meat, and if very salty, soak it in cold water 
6ver night, then put it into a pot with cold water to cover, 
set over a brisk fire, let it come to a boil, remove the scum, 
and let simmer slowly 3 or 4 hours, according to size. If the 
water boils away add more boiling water. Cabbage or turnips 
and potatoes may be boiled with the meat during the last 
hour. If the meat is to be served cold allow it to cool in the 
liquor. — [Mrs. E. D., Ida. 

Pressed Beef 

Cook a cheap piece of beef very slowly until very tender, 
then let the liquor boil away to a small amount; chop or grind 
the meat very fine, season well with salt, pepper, and a little 
sage and summer savory, moisten with the liquor in which 
the meat was cooked, pack very solidly in jars, and set away 
to chill. Serve cut in thin slices. — [Mrs. G. W. S., Kan. 

Braised Beef 

Cut 2 lbs round steak in dice 1 inch square. Put 2 gener- 
ous slices of salt pork in a kettle and fry brown; then remove 
the scraps, and add to the hot fat 1 large onion, sliced, and 
fry until brown, after which add the meat dredged with flour, 
the brown pork scraps, and enough water to partly cover, and 
simmer slowly 3 hours. During the last hour season with salt 
and pepper, and when done thicken the gravy with a little 
flour. — [Mrs. E. P. C, Me.

Roast Beef 

Take a piece of rib or loin, trim and wipe clean with a dry 
towel, put in a hot dripping pan with a little hot butter or 
suet, and set in a very hot oven. Remember that the oven 
must be very hot when the roast is first put in. Baste fre- 
quently and when partly done and nicely browned, season with 
salt and pepper and dredge with flour. Do not salt the raw 
meat, as that would draw out the juices and make it tough. 
A roast of about 8 lbs will require about 2 hours roasting. 
Less would leave the inside too rare and longer roasting 
would dry it out. When done remove the roast to a hot 
platter, skim the fat from the gravy in the pan, add about 
1 tablesp flour, stir well over the fire, and when browned pour 
in about 1 cup water. Boil up once and pour in a hot gravy 
boat.— [Mrs. L. J. P., Ore. 



A Quick Way to Roast Beef 

Plunge the beef in a kettle of boiling water and boil briskly 
until almost done. Add salt to taste during the last half 
hour. Put some butter or drippings in a pan on top of the 
stove, lift the meat from the broth, drain, and then put it in 
the pan of hot drippings and brown quickly on both sides. 
When nicely browned all over, remove the meat to a hot 
platter, add a little flour to the gravy in the pan, and when 
brown stir in some of the broth in which the meat was cooked. 
When boiling beef do not use any more water than is necessary. 
A nice roast can be prepared in this way in half the time it 
would take to roast it in the oven in the usual way. — [Mrs. 
E. M. C, 111. 

Pot Roast (Beef or Pork) 

Top or bottom round, or a piece of the chuck is nice for a 
pot roast of beef. The pot should be no larger than necessary 
to accommodate the meat, and an iron pot is best. Put some 
drippings in the pot, and let get very hot. Trim the meat, 
wipe it clean with a dry towel, and then put in the sizzling 
hot drippings, and turn until browned all over. Meanwhile 
fry some onions brown in a little drippings in a separate pan, 
and when the meat in the pot is well browned, add the 
browned onions, % or 1 cup boiling water, salt and pepper to 
taste, and 2 or 3 bay leaves. Cover the pot closely so that 
no steam can escape, and let it simmer on top of the stove 
until the roast is nice and tender, turning often and watch- 
ing carefully, so it does not burn. If the water seems to boil 
away too rapidly, add a very little more boiling water, when- 
ever necessary. When the meat is done, put on a hot platter. 



26 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

add a little flour to the gravy, and when this has browned 
nicely pour in a little cold water, boil up once, and then pour 
the gravy into a gravy boat. If a slightly sour taste is liked, 
1 or 2 tablesp vinegar may be added to the meat while roast- 
ing. — [A. G., Mass. 

Sour Pot Roast of Beef 

Put a piece of nicely trimmed beef in a deep dish, pour 
over it 1 cup vinegar, and set away in a cold place 3 days, 
turning and basting the meat with the vinegar frequently 
every day. After 3 days remove the meat from the vinegar, 
wipe with a dry towel, cut gashes in the meat and insert 
strips of fat bacon rolled in a mixture of salt, pepper and 
ground cloves. Put some butter or drippings in an iron pot, 
and when hot put in the beef, dredged with flour, and brown 
nicely on all sides; then add about 2 cups boiling water, 2 car- 
rots and 2 onions cut in pieces, 1 teasp whole pepper, 1 blade 
of mace, a small piece of lemon peel, and salt to taste. Cover 
closely and let simmer gently until the meat is tender, then 
take out the meat and vegetables, strain the gravy, return to 
the fire and thicken with a little flour. Put the meat on a 
platter, pour over 1 or 2 tablesp of the gravy, and garnish 
with the onions and carrots. Serve remainder of gravy in a 
boat.— [S. E. W., O. 

To Fry or Broil Steak 

Beefsteak should be cut thick. If you have any well- 
founded suspicion that it is not tender, lay it out on a clean 
table, and pound it hard on both sides with the side of a 
wooden potato masher. Have the frying pan very hot, put in 
some drippings, or butter, and when this is hot, put in the 
steak, and keep on moving it around, but do not prick with a 
fork, as this would cause the juices to run out. When brown 
on one side turn and brown on the other. The fire must be 
hot, for if steak is not fried quickly it will be tough. Put 
on a hot platter, add a very little hot w^ater to the gravy 
in the pan, pour over the steak, season with salt and pepper^ 
and serve at once. To broil steak have a nice clear fire of red 
coals, and turn steak often until a nice brown on both sides. 
Put on a hot platter with butter and season with salt and 
pepper. Never add salt to steak while frying or broiling. — ' 
[A. G., Mass. 

Hamburg Steak (Beef or Pork) 

Use clear beef, beef and pork mixed, or clear pork, allow- 
ing 14 part fat to % part lean. Chop or grind, sfieason with 
a little chopped onion, or onion juice, add pepper and salt 
to taste, shape into small, flat cakes, and fry brown on both 
sides in hot butter or drippings. — [M. A. M., Ind.

minced onion if liked, roll up, and tie securely with a string, 
or fasten with skewers. Put in a hot dripping pan with 
hot drippings, on top of the stove, and turn jthe roll until 
well browned on all sides, then pour in about 1 pt boiling 
water and 1 tablesp vinegar, season well with salt and pepper, 
cover closely, and let simmer on back of stove about 3 hours, 
by which time it will be nice and brown and tender. Thicken 
the gravy with a little flour, and serve with the meat. Nice 
sliced when cold. Can be roasted in the oven, if preferred. — 
[N. S. C, Cftl.

all the clots of blood and stringy parts, soak in salt water 2 
or 3 hours, then drain and put in a kettle with plenty of 
water, a piece of suet the size of an egg, salt and pepper to 
taste, and let boil until tender. Make a dressing moistened 
with the water in which the heart was boiled, and fill the 
opening of the heart, then put in a deep pan, and if any of 
the dressing is left over, place it around the heart, and 
bake until brown, turning and basting often, using the 
water in which the heart was boiled. — [Mrs. J. H. S. Mich.

1 tablesp salt, 1 teasp pepper, 2 or 3 well-beaten eggs, a 
very small chopped onion, 8 tablesp fine bread or cracker 
crumbs, and 1 cup milk. Mix thoroughly, shape into two loaves, 
roll in bread crumbs, dot with bits of butter, and bake 1 
hour, basting often. This recipe may be varied by combining 
% beef with ^,4 pork, omitting the suet, and using less 
eggs when the pork is used. Veal loaf is also nice, with 
1/4 part pork, which may be either fresh or salt. If the 
onion taste is not liked omit these, and flavor with a very 
little nutmeg and cloves. Instead of milk, water can be 
used, and instead of shaping into large loaves, make into 
small rolls or balls and either bake or fry them. The gravy 
in the pan should be thickened with a little flour and served 
with the meat. — [Mrs. L. P., Ore. 

Mutton with Cabbage and Potatoes 

Cut mutton in small pieces and put on with cold water 
enough to cover, add 1 small head crisp, tender cabbage, cut

water enough to cover and let come to a boil, then drain 
the water from the pork, return it to the fire, put slices of 
veal on top of the pork, dust with salt and pepper, and 
fry slowly, turning often until both are nicely browned. The 
flavor of both meats is improved by this combination and 
method of cooking. — [Mrs. A. B. W., N. Y. 



30 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



JeUied Veal 

Boil a lean piece of veal in water enough to cover, until 
the bones separate from the meat. Cut the meat in small

taste. Bring the edges of the meat together and sew them 
up, then wrap the meat in a well greased sheet of white 
paper, tie up with twine, put in a dripping pan, place in a 
hot oven, and baste often with the grease which will melt 
from the roast. Bake about 20 minutes for eacl pound of 
pork. — [Mrs. R. F. K., la. 

Pried Pork Tenderloin 

Cut the tenderloin in 1-inch slices, pound with a potato 
masher, sprinkle with salt and pepper, roll in beaten egg, 
then in cracker crumbs, and fry a nice brown in plenty hot 
drippings, or butter. Tenderloin is too dry for boiling, and 
if roasted should be basted frequently. — [Mrs. M. M. B., Mo. 

Mock Birds (Pork) 

Spread any preferred dressing on thin slices of lean, boiled 
salt pork, fasten the ends together firmly with wooden tooth- 
picks, brown these rolls in; a pan, and then remove to a

A Favorite Dutch Dish 

Boil 8 good sized ham bone in about 1 gal water for several 
hours. Water in which the ham was boiled (if the ham was 
scraped nice and clean) can be used. When done, take out 
the ham bone, and when the water is cooled, add to it 1 qt 
dried apples, and let them soak until they have softened. This 
should be done the evening before the dish is wanted, and 
the same evening a new baking of bread should be put 
to rise. Next morning put the pot of ham bone liquor and 
soaked apples over the fire, and as soon as it boils, break off 
little pieces from the raised bread dough, size of a walnut, drop 
into the boiling liquor and boil till the apples and bread 
dumplings are done. Serve hot. — [Mrs. H. L., Va. 

Sansage Fritters 

To V<z pt sour milk or buttermilk, add % teasp soda, Vz 
teasp salt, and flour enough to make a moderately stiff

escape. — [Mrs. M. E. R., Wis. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 33 



Crust for Pot Pie 

To 1 qt flour add 1 teasp salt, 4 teasp baking powder, and 
milk enough to make a stiff batter. Drop batter by spoonsful 
into a pan of flour, roll around in the flour, pat into shape 
with the hands, and when the meat is nearly done, drop these 
bits of crust into the kettle. The liquid should be boiling 
briskly. Cover and cook i/^ hour. The covered kettle may 
be transferred from the stove to a hot oven, as soon as the 
crust is put in and if the kettle is not too full, it will not 
boil over, and the crust will not be heavy. — [Miss G. R., N. Y. 

Meat Pie 

Use any remnants of left-over beef, pork, veal, lamb or mut- 
ton and left-over potatoes ot equal quantity, or take small pieces 
of fresh meat and raw potatoes, and boil them together until 
tender, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Let the 
gravy boil down some, and thicken with very little flour. Line 
a deep pie pan with a short biscuit or pie crust, rolled out 
about V4. inch thick, put in the meat and potatoes with the 
gravy, cover with a top crust, in which several slits were 
cut to allow for the escape of steam, pinch the edges together, 
and bake until a nice brown. Do not put too much gravy in 
the pie, but if there is any left over, serve it separately with 
the pie. If onions are liked, boil this with the meat and 
potatoes. — [Mrs. J. H. S., Mich. 

Veal Pot Pie 

Cut 2 lbs veal in small pieces, and put over the fire with 
2 qts cold water. Bring to a quick boil, then move to the

gravy, or, if you have no gravy, make some by frying onions 
brown in drippings, and thickening with flour, adding a very 
little water. Put the meat and gravy in a pudding dish, and 
cover with mashed potatoes an inch thick. Moisten the top 
slightly with milk, dot with bits of butter, and bake until 
brown. Serve hot. — [Mrs. S. C. P., Mass. 

Mock Chicken Pie 

Pare and slice 1 qt potatoes and 3 onions, add 2 tablesp 
butter, and 1 teasp each sage and salt. Cook until tender 
in plenty water, then drain and put the liquid in a basin to 
keep hot. Put the potatoes and onions in a well buttered 
dish, slice 6 hard-boiled eggs on top, moisten with a little 
of the potato liquid, cover with a rich biscuit dough, and 
bake. The potato water may be thickened with a little flour, 
and served with the pie. — [Miss E. I. B., Cal. 

Ham Pie 

Boil slice of lean, cured ham or shoulder about 1 hour. Line 
a buttered pan with biscuit dough, put in a layer of the 
cooked meat, season with pepper, scatter a few dumplings 
of the dough over the meat, pour over some of the water 
the ham was boiled in, then another layer of meat and dump- 
lings with some more of the meat liquor, and then break in 
as many eggs as you have people to serve, or as many as 
you can spare. Put on the top crust, bake, and when nearly 
done pour in about 1 pt sweet milk, and finish baking. — 
[Mrs. H. A. B., Mont. 

Baked Hash 

Take pieces of left-over cooked or roasted meat and pota- 
toes, chop coarsely, and season with salt, pepper and onion 
juice. Butter a pudding dish, cover the sides and bottom 
with bread crumbs, put in the meat and potatoes, add some 
left-ovei gravy, or hot butter and water, cover with crumbs, 
dot with bits of butter, and bake about 20 minutes. If no 
cold boiled potatoes are at hand, chop some raw potatoes 
and onions, put in the pan with a little water, salt and 
pepper, cover, and simmer until done, then add the meat 
and pour into the pudding dish. — [A. G., Mass. 

India Cnrry with Rice 

Cut onions in rings and fry brown in butter; when brown 
take out the onions, and fry pieces of meat, fish, garne^ OE 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 35 

poultry in the same fat, adding a small piece of garlic, a 
little coriander seed, and 1 heaping teasp curry powder. 
Let simmer 1 minute, stirring all the time, then add a 
little hot water and let simmer 1 hour over a slow fire. 
Adtiing an apple cut in pieces is a great improvement. Put 
1 cu:p rice over the fire with 3 qts water, and when tender, 
drain through a colander. Pour a pt cold water over the rice 
in the colander, shake well, and when thoroughly drained, 
serve hot with the curry. The water that the rice was 
boiled in makes good starch for clothes, or with a little 
lemon juice and sugar makes a good drink for invalids. — 
[Capt. A. H., N. J. 

To Pick and Clean Poultry 

For market, dry picking is the best way — that is, pulling 
out the feathers immediately after killing, while the poultry 
is still warm, but for home consumption, the scalding method 
is the quicker and easier. After killing dip in scalding hot 
water and move about for a few minutes, then pick as 
quickly as possible. Ducks should be scalded a little longer 
and then wrapped in canvas or any close cloth, to steam 
about 5 to 10 minutes, after which the feathers can be 
easily pulled. The hairs should be singed off by holding 
and turning the poultry in the flames of a lighted twist ©f 
paper, or some burning alcohol. Wash thoroughly and dry, 
and then lay on several folds of paper, and clean at once. 
The quicker poultry is cleaned, the better, but it is best not 
to cook it until 24 hours after killing. 

After singeing, and before drawing, pull out all pin feathers, 
then cut off the head, and next cut through the skin around 
each leg, about l^^ inches below the first leg joint, being 
careful not to cut tendons. Place the leg* with the cut 
over the edge of a table, press downward to snap the bone, 
then take the foot in the right hand, holding the bird firmly 
in the left hand, and pull off the foot, and with it the 
tendons. Make a lengthwise cut through the skin just 
below the breast bone, large enough to admit the hand, 
and remove the entrails entire, by first carefully loosening 
them all around, and then bringing the hand forward, grasp- 
ing the entrails firmly, and with one pull drawing them out. 
The lungs and kidneys, on either side of the back-bone, 
should next be removed, and then the wind-pipe and crop^ 
close to the skin of the breast, by inserting two fingers under 
the neck skin. Draw down the skin and cut the neck off 
close to the body, leaving on enough skin to close up the 
opening after the crop is partly filled with a little dressing. 
The giblets (gizzard, heart and liver) should next be care- 
fully separated from the entrails, being careful not to break 



36 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



the gall bag attached to the liver, the bile from which would 
impart an extremely bitter flavor to any parts it came in 
contact with. Then wash the bird thoroughly in and out- 
side, rub with salt, and let hang in a cool place over night. — ■ 
[A. G., Mass. 

Steamed Fowl 

Dress a 5 or 6 lb chicken, wash and dry thoroughly, and 
rub with salt and pepper, in and outside. Place an onion 
and a bay leaf inside, and put the fowl into shape the same 
as for roasting. Sprinkle a clean towel v/ith flour, wrap it 
about the fowl, pinning closely, and then place it, back 
down, in a steamer, and steam continuously 2 or 3 hours, 
according to its age and size. Serve with currant or cran- 
berry jelly. — [Mrs. E. D., Ida. 

Fried Chicken 

Dress a young chicken, cut off the legs, wings and neck, 
and then cut down the back bone, and press the body open, 
breaking the breast bone by pounding lightly. Boil the legs, 
wings, and giblets in water enough to cover, and when 
tender add salt and pepper to taste, and 1 tablesp flour mixed 
with 1 tablesp butter. This will answer as a dressing for the 
fried chicken. Dip the body of the chicken in corn meal 
and fry brown in hot drippings. — [Mrs. H. L., Va. 

Pickled Chicken 

This is a nice way to prepare old and tough chicken. Clean 
and joint and soak in cold salted water several hours, then put 
on with fresh water and salt, 2 or 3 sliced onions, 2 or 3 
bay leaves, % doz whole allspice, and when nearly done 
add enough vinegar to make it quite sour to taste. Let boil 
until done, then pour into a crock. There should be enough 
liquid to cover the fowl. Let stand over night. When cold 
the liquid will be jellied. — [Mrs. G. A., Minn. 

Scalloped Chicken 

Dress and joint the chicken, sprinkle with pepper and salt 
and place in a pan with butter size of an egg, and milk to cover. 
Bake until tender. If the milk boils away add more milk, 
or hot water. Thicken the milk gravy with a little flour 
just before serving. — [C. B. O., Kan. 

Smothered Chicken 

Dress and joint a young chicken, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, roll in flour or corn meal, place the pieces closely in 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



a bread pan, half cover with cold water or milk, and if the 
chicken is not very fat add lumps of butter or some thick 
slices of fat bacon. Bake until done. When one side is 
brown, turn to brown on the other side, and when nearly done 
put a 2-inch square of biscuit dough on top of each piece of 
chicken, return to the oven, and bake until a nice brown. 
When done, remove the chicken with crust to a hot platter, 
add 1 cup rich cream to the liquor in the pan, thicken with. 
a little flour, let boil up, and serve with the chicken. — » 
[Mrs. M. M. B., Mont. 

Pressed or Potted Chicken 

Dress and joint a chicken, and boil in water enough to 
cover, until the meat slips from the bones. Drain off the 
liquor, remove the bones, and cut the meat in small pieces, 
but do not chop fine, and season with salt and pepper. Boil 
the broth down to 1 pt, put a layer of meat in a mold 
with some slices of hard-boiled eggs, then more chicken and 
eggs, seasoning to taste, then pour in the broth, and set 
away to get cold. Another way instead of boiling down 
the broth, is to thicken it with bread crumbs, or 1 tablesp 
clear gelatine dissolved in a little hot water. — [K. S., la. 

Chicken Fricassee 

Dress and joint a chicken, and let it simmer slowly, closely 
covered, in 1 qt hot water, with 2 stalks celery, 1 bay leaf, 
1 slice of onion, salt and pepper to taste, and a pinch of 
curry. When the chicken is tender, remove from the liquid 
and place on a hot platter. Stir into the liquid 1 beaten 
egg, V2 cup cream, or 1 tablesp butter, and 1 tablesp flour, 
and let boil up, then pour over the chicken and serve hot. 
The platter may be garnished with a border of hot mashed 
potatoes, and edged with parsley. — [Mrs. E. J. G., Mass. 

Chicken Sonp with Dumplings 

Dress and cut up a chicken, and put on to boil in plenty 
of cold water, adding salt to taste. Let boil long and slowly, 
and about one hour before serving add 1 pt carrots, peeled 
and sliced fine, and % hour later 1 qt potatoes, peeled and 
sliced also, an onion, if liked, and % hour later dumplings 
made as follows. Put Vz cup butter in a frying pan and when 
hot add ^2 cup flour, and let cook about 10 minutes, stirring 
vigorously, but do not let it brown. Then add some of the 
chicken broth, a little at a time, to convert the mass into a 
smooth ball which will free entirely from the pan. Remove 
from the fire, and when cool add 1 or 2 beaten eggs, and 
mix well. Drop into the boiling soup by spoonsful and boil 
steadily about I'B or 20 minutes. — [Mrs. A. P., Neb.

Hot Tamales 

Boil a chicken until very tender, remove bones and chop 
meat fine. To each lb meat add 1 medium sized tomato and 
onion chopped fine, salt and red pepper to taste, and moisten 
to the consistency of mush with the chicken broth. Heat 
the remainder of the liquor to boiling, stir in cornmeal to 
make a little stiffer than ordinary mush, and cook thoroughly. 
Take nice, fresh corn husks and soak in warm water until 
soft. Then spread a half-inch layer of mush on each husk, 
and put a good spoonful of the meat mixture on that, and 
roll up so that the meat is covered by the mush and the 
whole is nicely wrapped in the husks. Turn in the ends 
and tie tightly with twine, and steam % hour. Serve in 
the husks. Nice tamales can be made in the same way 
with either fresh beef or fresh pork. The neck of beef is 
best, as it has the right proportion of fat and lean, and the 
shoulder of pork is good, adding a little more fat to it. ^ 

Fried Guinea-Hen 

Select a nice, fat guinea-hen weighing about 3 lbs, clean 
and wash thoroughly in cold water, and put in a kettle over 
the fire with scarcely enough cold water to cover, adding 1 
teasp salt and 1 tablesp vinegar, after the hen has boiled 
1 hour. When tender joint and cut in pieces of convenient 
size, and fry brown on both sides in butter. Remove from 
the frying pan to platter, add 1 cup thick sweet cream to 
the gravy in the pan, season to taste, let boil up, and serve. — 
[Mrs. C. E. D., N. Y. 

Roast Turkey 

Having properly dressed and stuffed the turkey, rub entire 
surface with salt, spread breast, wings and legs with butter, 
rubbed until creamy and mixed with flour, and dredge bottom 
of pan with flour. Place in hot oven, and when flour on 
turkey begins to brown, reduce heat, baste with fat in pan» 
and add 2 cups soiling water. Continue basting every 15 
minutes until tur ey is cooked, which will require about 3 
hours for a 10-lb turkey. For basting, use Vz cup butter 
melted in y2 cup boiling water in which the giblets were 
cooked, and after lis is used baste with fat in pan. During 
cooking, turn turk y frequently, that it may brown evenly. 
To prepare gravy: As soon as turkey is removed from pan 
pour off liquid, from which skim 6 tablesp fat, return fat 
to ^^an, brown with 1 or 2 tablesp flour, and pour on gradually 
t\e remaining liquor, to which the giblets, finely chopped, 
nave been added, and cook 5 minutes. Remove string and 
skewers from turkey, and garnish with parsley or celery tips 
before serving.

Roast Goose 

Dress and wash thorouglily, and half fill with a dressing 
prepared as follows: Boil and chop fine 1 doz onions and 
mix well with an equal quantity of bread crumbs; add 1 
teasp sage, salt, and 1 level teasp pepper. Bake in a hot 
oven, basting frequently. When done skim the fat from 
the gravy in the pan, add the liquid from the boiled giblets, 
and also the giblets chopped fine, thicken with a little flour, 
and season o taste. Serve goose with apple sauce. — [S. B., 
N. Y. — A very nice dressing for goose is boiled sauerkraut, 
seasoned with pepper. — [Mrs. J. H., Minn. 

Boiled or Koasted Duck 

A delicious flavor is imparted to boiled duck by boiling 
with it 1 large onion, 1 tablesp vinegar, and about V2 teasp 
sage, besides salt and pepper. When tender, remove the 
duck, boil down the liquor, skim off the fat, thicken with a 
little flour browned in a pan with some butter, return the 
duck to the gravy, and let simmer a few minutes. To roast, 
if the duck is very fat or old, parboil it first, with a pinch 
of baking soda, then stuff with any preferred dressing, (the 
English use raisins, prunes or apples in the dressing), pin 
a few thin slices of salt pork across the breast with wooden 
toothpicks, and baste often. Onions, sage and salt pork 
combine very nicely with the duck flavor. Another nice way 
is to joint, season with salt, pepper and sage, roll in flour, 
and put in layers in a small pan, with minced onion and bits 
*f butter between, ending with a layer of onions, bread crumbs 
and butter. Then fill the pan half full with water or milk, 
cover closely, and bake about 2 hours, removing the upper 
paa during the last % hour, to brown nicely. — [A. G., Mass. 

Baked Jack Rabbit 

If "jack" is old, after dressing, parboil for 3 to 5 minutes, 
adding about 1 teasp soda to the hot water, and then drain. 
Fasten slices of salt pork across the back of the rabbit, with 
wooden toothpicks. This imparts a good flavor and prevents 
the drying out of the meat. Season and dredge well with 
flour, and put a few bits of butter around the rabbit in the 
pan, adding a very little water, and about 1 tablesp vinegar. 
Baste often. When done thicken the gravy with a little 
flour. — [Mrs. W. H., Kan. 

Curried Rabbit 

Wash and joint the rabbit and dredge each piece with 
flour. Put the good trimmings and a few scraps of meat 



40 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

with 2 large onions, 1 carrot, sliced, a small pinch of herbs, 
6 pepper corns, and 1 tablesp curry powder in a saucepan 
with enough cold water to cover, and simmer for l^^ hours, 
and then strain off the liquor. Pry 1 small minced onion 
a light brown in 1 tablesp drippings, add 1 tablesp curry 
paste, and stir over the fire about 10 minutes, then add the 
stock, and when it has come to a boil, draw It to the side 
and let it simmer. The sauce may be thickened with a 
little flour. While this is simmering prepare the rabbit as 
follows. Fry the flour-dredged joints brown in a little 
drippings, with 1 onion, then add to the curry sauce, and 
let stand on the back of the range to simmer very slowly 
about 1 hour. Just before serving add a little lemon juice, 
and pepper and salt to taste, and serve hot, with boiled rice 
and red currant jelly. — [M. L. D., Scotland. 

Stewed Rabbit 

Dress and clean a couple of young rabbits, joint them, 
and put into a stew pan with 2 large Spanish onions, cut 
small; add enough milk to cover, season with white pepper, 
cover closely, and stew very slowly until tender, then season, 
with salt, add butter to the gravy, and thicken with flour. 
If any of this dish is left over dip each piece in beateu 
egg, roll in bread crumbs or cornmeal, season with salt, 
pepper and a little grated lemon rind, and fry in hot drip- 
pings until nicely browned on both sides. Serve hot with 
the gravy seasoned with lemon juice and cayenne pepper, 
or a little catsup. Young rabbits are also nice cooked with 
green peas. Joint and put in a stew pan with a slice of lean 
ham, cut in small pieces, 1 tablesp butter, 1 or 2 spring 
onions, a small sprig of parsley, and 1 qt fresh green peas. 
Dredge in some flour, pour in a little milk, and let come 
to a boil, then draw to the back of the stove and let stew 
slowly until rabbit and peas are tender. Just before serving 
season with salt and a very little sugar. — [M. L. D., Scotland. 

Baked Coon 

The raccoon which makes free with the farmer's com gets 
very fat in the fall, on corn, apples and clover, and makes 
delicious eating, though often thrown away because of the 
prejudice that many people have against wild meat. FirstJ 
skin the coon carefully, then remove the layer of fat, which! 
is often an inch thick, right under the skin. This fat would 
give the meat a disagreeable, oily taste, if left on, but it is 
nice and white, and can be tried out the same as leaf lard, 
and used for soap. Thoroughly wash the dressed coon in 
cold water and soak over night in cold water with 1 tables^ 
salt added to each gallon water. Bake the same as veaL 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 41 

If the coon is old, as shown by large size, dark meat, and 
stiff hard bones and joints, it should be parboiled from 1 
to 2 hours, before roasting. — [I. R. N., Me. 

"'Possum and Sweet 'Taters" 

Pour a large kettleful of hot water in a convenient vessel, 
add a small shovel of ashes, and then put the 'possum in 
this, but do not have the water as hot as for scalding chickens. 
Turn the 'possum around until the fur is loosened, and you 
will have no trouble in skinning him perfectly clean. Remove 
head, feet and entrails, wash thoroughly in cold water, salt in 
and outside, and let hang over night. In the morning wash 
again and put in a baking pan with a little water. Cover 
closely with another pan, and put it over the fire. When 
tender remove the top pan and put the 'possum in the oven to 
brown. Dust with black pepper and baste with lard. While 
it is baking, peel potatoes, cut them in thick slices, and put 
them in a skillet over the fire with salt and a little water and 
lard. Cover, and let steam until tender. By that time the 
'possum will be nicely brown. Turn the prepared potatoes 
over him, return to the oven, and when nicely brown, put 
the 'possum on a platter, arrange the potatoes around him, 
and serve. — [Mrs. S. J. S., Ala. 

Fried Venison with Gravy 

Cut venison into medium thick slices, hack it criss-cross 
with a butcher's knife on both sides, roll in flour, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and fry in hot drippings until evenly 
browned on both sides. Put the steak on a warm platter 
and add V2 cup milk and cream mixed to the gravy in the 
frying pan and a very little flour to thicken slightly. Let boil 
up once, and then pour over the steak, and serve at once. — 
[Mrs. B. H., Ore. 

Bread Dressing 

To 1 qt bread crumbs add 1 onion, chopped fine, salt, pepper 
and sage to taste, 1 or 2 beaten eggs, and fatty meat liquor 
to moisten. — [Mrs. W. H. B., Cal. 

Oyster Dressing 

Mix together 1 qt stale bread crumbs, 1 pt finely chopped 
oysters, 1 beaten egg, 2 tablesp melted butter, 1 teasp herbs, 
and milk enough to moisten. — [Mrs. J. C. R., Ind. 



When roasting beef or pork, add some thick slices of raw 
carrot. They impart a delicious flavor to the meat and 
gravy. — [Mrs. B. L. G., Ore.

Drawn Butter Sauce 

Melt V4, cup butter in a saucepan, add 2 tablesp flour, % 
teasp salt, a pinch of pepper, and when well blended, 1 pt hot 
water or hot clear soup stock. Stir rapidly until it thickens; 
then add another scant ^^ cup butter, a little at a time, and 
continue stirring and cooking until the butter is all absorbed. 
This sauce can be made the basis of parsley, egg, caper, 
lemon, celery, shrimp, mustard, oyster, lobster and other

White Sauce 

Melt 2 rounding tablesp butter in a saucepan, adding the 
same quantity flour, and stirring until free from lumps. Then 
add 1 pt hot milk, pouring in less than half at first, and 
when it thickens rubbing and beating until entirely free from 
lumps. Then add the remainder of the milk, a very little 
pepper and V2 teasp salt, and let it boil up again. Half the 
milk may be replaced by clear soup stock, or cream may be

sauce may be used instead of drawn butter sauce, in any of 
the variations of drawn butter sauce, if a less rich sauce 
is desired. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 43 



Brown Sauce 

Melt - rounding tablesp butter in a saucepan, adding the 
same quantity of flour, and stirring until nicely browned, but 
not burned. Then add 1 pt hot, dark soup stock, i/^ teasp 
salt, a little pepper, and, if not dark enough, caramel (burnt 
sugar) enough to give the desired color. Cook until it thick- 
ens, rubbing out all lumps. The sauce will be better flavored 
if pot herbs, a bit of onion and a few peppercorns are added

through a sieve; add to y^ pt white sauce made with cream, 
and serve with lamb or mutton chop. 

Mint Sauce 

Chop enough leaves and tender tops of mint to fill 1 cup 
(or use half the quantity of the dried leaves). Add y^ cup 
sugar, and y^ cup not-too-strong vinegar. Prepare an hour 
before using, to allow the vinegar to absorb the flavor of 
the mint. 

Tomato Sauce 

To 1 pt stewed tomatoes add a small chopped onion, a sprig 
of parsley, a bay leaf, blade of mace, salt and pepper to taste. 
While they are simmering for 15 minutes, melt 3 level tablesp 
butter and rub into it 1 tablesp flour. Strain the tomatoes 
through a sieve, add to the flour and butter, and boil until it 
thickens, stirring continually. 

Hot Horseradish Sauce

To make it, melt 1 tablesp butter in a saucepan and stir in 1 
tablesp flour. Add 1 cup milk, or better, 1 cup chicken or veal 
broth, and boil for 5 minutes. Beat the yolk of 1 ^zz, add 
1 scant teasp each of sugar and made mustard, and i^ cup

lemon juice, and simmer for 2 or 3 minutes. Use at once. 

Celery Sauce 

Clean and chop very fine 2 large heads of celery, reserving 
a few of the stalks to cut into inch lengths. Cover with cold 
water and cook until the celery is quite tender and the water 



44 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

nearly boiled away. Pick out the long pieces, and add 1 pt 
rich milk or cream, 1 level teasp salt, and a dash of 
pepper. Rub together 1 heaping tablesp each of butter 
and flour, add the beaten yolk of 1 egg, and stir into the 
milk. Let simmer for 10 minutes, adding the long pieces of 
celery, and serve with chicken or turkey. The egg is not 
essential, but gives a better color to the sauce. 

Chestnut Sauce 

Shell 1 pt chestnuts and drop into boiling water 5 minutes. 
Slip off the skins, split open, and cook in salted water or stock 
until very tender. Rub through a sieve and add to the brown 
pan gravy from roast turkey. To make the sauce independent 
of the turkey gravy, brown 1 tablesp flour in 2 tablesp butter, 
pour in the water or stock in which the nuts were boiled, 
adding the mashed nuts, pepper and salt to season-. 

Made Mustard 

Mix together 2 tablesp mustard, 1 teasp each of sugar, flour

ing 3 tablesp made mustard, and a dash of cayenne to 1 pt 
drawn butter sauce. — [Mrs. A. B., Col. 

Spanish Sauce 

Peel and chop fine 2 or 3 large, ripe tomatoes and 2 onions, 
add 3 or 4 green chillis, seeds removed, and chopped fine, and 
season with salt, and a little vinegar. This is usually served 
with barbacued meat. — [Mrs. L. J., Cal. 

Fish Sauce 

Cook 3 or 4 ripe tomatoes with 1 tablesp butter, % an onion, 
cut fine, and salt and pepper to taste. When done rub through 
a sieve and gradually stir in 1 cup boiling milk. Thicken with

eggs, 1 cup sweet cream, V2 cup mustard, and 1 teasp salt, and 
pour this mixture into the vinegar and let come to a boil. Then 
put in jar and seal. This will keep well in a cold place and 
is nice with cold meats, fish, etc. — [G. W. J. 




Potatoes, Vegetables and Salads 

AREFUL cooking of vegetables and judi- 
cious mixing of salads are not the least part 
of culinary proficiency. Since vegetables 
are the most healthful of our food stuffs, 
they should be served freely, but in such 
shape that they may be easy of digestion 
and palatable. That responsibility rests 
with the cook. Salads are considered of less importance 
in food value, but as a relish they find a welcome place 
on the menu. It takes an '"artist" to properly blend the 
ingredients for a salad dressing — quantities can only be 
suggested in a recipe — the rest is "up to" the cook. 

Potato Ways 

Do not always serve potatoes in the same old way. It would 
seem to be a very simple matter to boil a potato, and yet 
there is a proper and improper way of doing even this. First 
wash potatoes, then peel and drop in cold water, and if the 
tubers are old, let them stand in fresh cold water for an hour 
or two, to draw out the sharp flavor. Use an agate or por- 
celain-lined vessel. Cover the potatoes with fresh boiling 
water, add salt, cover closely, and boil briskly until done. Test 
with a sharp steel fork. When done, drain off water and put 
the pot on back of the stove to let the potatoes dry 
off, then cover with a clean napkin, to keep warm, but do not 
delay the serving any longer than necessary. When potatoes 
are to be boiled "in their jackets" — that is, without peeling — 
wash them clean and follow the above directions. When done 
put them in a hot oven a few minutes to dry. To bake pota- 
toes, wash, place in a hot oven, and prick the skins with a 
sharp fork, to allow the steam to escape. Potatoes are also 
nice when baked with the roast meat. Peel and cut in uniform 
size, place around the roast during the last three-quarter hour, 
and baste potatoes along with the roast meat. 

Boiled potatoes for frying should not be too soft and mealy; 
cut in thin slices and fry in very hot drippings, turning so that 
they may be browned evenly; but do not have too many pota- 
toes in the pan at once, and be sure to have the fat hot, and 
fry quickly, otherwise the potatoes will soak grease and turn 



46 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



out unpalatable and unwholesome. To fry raw potatoes slice 
them any thickness desired (for potato chips they should be 
cut very thin), dry thoroughly on a clean towel, and drop in 
smoking, hot fat, the same as doughnuts, turning to brown on 
both sides. Do not put too many potatoes in at once, as this 
would reduce the temperature of the fat and cause the pota- 
toes to soak grease. When done skim out the slices, lay them 
out on a piece of soft paper to soak up the superfluous fat, 
sprinkle with salt, and serve hot. They should be nice and 
crisp. Another way is to peel the potatoes and then peel 
them again, so as to have a long spiral ribbon, and bake these 
in deep hot fat. A very nice dish is made of diced potatoes, 
salt pork and onions. Cut the pork in pieces, fry brown, and 
then add the potatoes and onions, and let all brown together. 
To prepare mashed potatoes, mash the potatoes- after boiling 
and draining, add hot milk and butter, and beat until light. 
If desired, the yolk of an egg may be added, and a little 
more milk, the mixture turned into a buttered pudding dish, 
rolled cracker or bread crumbs sprinkled over the top, with 
dots of butter, and put in the oven to brown. — [A. G., Mass. 

Escalloped Potatoes 

Slice cold, boiled potatoes, put a layer in a buttered pudding 
dish, then a layer of cracker or bread crumbs, sprinkle with 
pepper and salt, dot with butter, and so proceed until the 
dish is full, topping off with bread crumbs and butter. Put 
in milk enough to come almost to the top of the potatoes, and 
bake brown. Raw potatoes can be treated the same way, and 
if liked, some finely cut onions added, and salt pork fried 
brown; add either milk or clear soup stock for liquid. — [Mrs. 
C. G., N. D. 

Stuffed Potatoes 

Cut large baked potatoes in two, lengthwise and scoop out 
the interior, keeping the shells whole. Mash the potatoes and 
to each one add 1 teasp grated cheese, 1 tablesp cream, and 
salt, pepper and butter to taste. Whip until light, heap into 
the shells, and return to oven to brown. Serve with a garnish 
of lettuce and hard-boiled eggs. — [Mrs. G. L. S., N. Y. 

Potato Loaf 

To 1 cup chopped suet add 2 qt chopped potatoes, 2 large 
onions, cut fine, 1 cup meat gravy or soup stock, or milk and 
butter mixed, and salt and pepper to taste. Turn into a but- 
tered baking dish, cover, and bake till done. Then remove the 
cover and brown the top. — [Mrs. L. S., Minn. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 47 



Sweet Potato Croquettes 

Mash cold sweet potatoes and to each qt add 1 teasp salt, 2 
tablesp sugar, 1 beaten egg, and scant y2 cup rich milk, with 
a very little flour — just enough to handle. Shape into small 
biscuits, roll in flour, and fry brown on both sides in hot 
butter. — [Miss F. E. S., Ga. 

Stuffed Sweet Potatoes 

Peel large, short, sweet potatoes, and cut in half length- 
wise; scrape out one-third of the potatoes, and fill the cavities 
with pork sausage meat, then lay the halves together again, 
and fasten at each end with a wooden toothpick. Put in a 
baking pan with a little water, and bake until tender, with a 
moderate fire, basting occasionally. — [Mrs. J. C. R., Ind. 

Candied Sweet Potatoes 

To 2 cups sugar add 1 cup water, and boil until it syrups, 
the same as for preserves, then remove from the fire and stir 
in 1 heaping tablesp butter. Slice boiled sweet potatoes into 
a buttered baking pan of the proper size, pour the syrup over 
them to almost cover, put extra bits of butter about on top 
of them, and bake about 1 hour, or longer, basting occasion- 
ally by tilting the pan and dipping up some of the liquid. Be 
careful not to let the top get dry. Serve hot in the pan in which 
it is baked. — [Mrs. P. A. D., Mo. 

Fried Corn 

Cut tender corn from the cob and fry In a little sweet butter, 
just enough to keep the corn from sticking to the pan, stirring 
often. When nicely browned, season with salt and pepper, and 
add a little sweet cream. Serve immediately. — [L. A. K., 111. 

Baked Com 

To 1 pt green corn cut from the cob, add 1 qt milk, 3 beaten 
eggs, 1 heaping tablesp butter, and salt to taste. Sprinkle a 
battered pudding dish with cracker crumbs, pour in the com 
mixture, cover with cracker crumbs, dot with butter, and bake 
slowly 11/2 hours. — [L. A. K., 111. 

Boiled Green Com 

Freshly gathered com is best for boiling. It loses its 
sweetness if you wait too long after picking. Strip off the 
husks and silk, cut off the stem ends, and plunge into briskly 
toiling water to cover. Do not add any salt. Cover the kettle 



48 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



and let boil fast, 20 minutes. Pile the corn up on a platter, 
cover v/ith a clean towel, and serve at once, or cut from the 
cob, add pepper, salt, butter and a little cream. — [L. A. K., 111. 

Dried Corn 

Cook sweet corn on the cob in salted water about 20 min- 
utes, then cut from the cob, spread on shallow plates, and dry 
very slowly in a rather cool oven. Put the dried corn in sacks 
and place in a v/arm, dry place. If in about 10 days the corn 
shows no signs of moisture it will keep well, but if any mois- 
ture remains in the corn, it will mildew. When wanted for 
use soak 1 pt dried corn in cold water over night, and if 
wanted for dinner, put over the fire about ten o'clock with a 
small piece of lean fresh pork, or salt pork, 1 doz potatoes, 
peeled and cut in small pieces, and water enough to cook. — 
[Mrs. M. E. B., Wis. 

Salted Corn and Beans 

Cook corn on the cob, cut off and salt down in a glass 
jar, allowing 1 cup salt to 4 cups corn. This will make 
its own brine, but if in 2 or 3 days there is not sufficient brine 
to cover, make a strong brine and cover, and weight down. 
When wanted for use put the desired quantity of corn in clear 
cold water, and put it on the back of the range where it will 
get lukewarm, and let stand 3 or 4 hours, after which drain^ 
and if not too salt, add cream and butter, and cook. Beans, 
when fresh and tender, can be put down in salt the same 
way, only do not cook the beans first. — [Mrs. A. H., Col. 

Stewed Tomatoes 

There are many different ways of stewing tomatoes. I do 
not like my stewed tomatoes mixed with a lot of mushy bread 
or cracker crumbs. Peel ripe tomatoes, or use the peeled 
canned tomatoes. Boil until tender, but no longer, and do 
not add any seasoning until just before serving, and then add 
pepper, salt and butter, and thicken with a very little flour 
mixed to a smooth paste with cold water. Boil up once, and 
lastly add a very little sugar — not enough to make it sweet, 
but just enough to kill the sour taste. Never boil tomatoes 
any longer than absolutely necessary, and serve at once. — 
[A. G., Mass. 

Creamed Tomatoes 

Let 1 qt canned or fresh tomatoes come to a boil, then add 
1 heaping tablesp each flour and sugar, 1 teasp salt, and a 
pinch of soda, all mixed well with a little cold milk to a smooth 
paste. Let boil up once, then add 1 cup thick, sweet cream, 
and when heated through, serve at once. — [Mrs. A. B., Ore. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 4& 



Escalloped Tomatoes 

Sprinkle the bottom of a buttered pudding dish with bread 
crumbs, then fill up with ripe, peeled and sliced tomatoes, 
seasoning each layer with butter, pepper, salt and some minced 
onions, if liked. Cover thickly with bread crumbs, dot liber- 
ally with butter, and bake. — [E. T., N. Y. 

Fried Tomatoes 

Either ripe or green tomatoes may be used. Peel, cut cross- 
wise in half-inch slices, dip in beaten egg, sprinkle with salt, 
pepper, and a very little sugar, dip in flour and fry in hot 
butter. — [Mrs. E. A., N. H, 

Scrambled Tomatoes 

Peel % doz medium sized tomatoes, cut in small pieces, 
and put in a saucepan with butter size of an egg, salt, and a 
little pepper. Boil till soft, then stir in 4 beaten eggs, cook 2 
or 3 minutes longer, and serve at once. — [R. M. P., Mass. 

Stuffed Tomatoes 

Cut slice from stem end of tomatoes, remove pulp, and mix 
up with some minced onion, bread crumbs, beaten egg, and 
pepper and salt, and fill into the tomato shells. Put a lump of 
butter on each tomato, and bake in a buttered pudding dish. 
Another way is to mix with the tomato pulp some hulled corn, 
or rice, or macaroni with grated cheese. — [R. M. P., Mass. 

Baked Tomatoes and Onions 

Peel and cut up 6 medium sized green tomatoes and 3 
onions, add 1 qt water (or a litle less), 1 tablesp each salt, 
sugar, and butter, 2 tablesp vinegar, and i/4 teasp pepper. 
Boil until tender, then turn into a buttered pudding dish, 
cover with 1 pt bread crumbs, dot with bits of butter, and 
bake. — [Mrs. H. M. S., Pa. 

Carrots 

Peel and cut carrots in very small pieces and put over the 
fire with a little water, salt and butter. Cook until tender, 
and when most all the water has cooked off, thicken the re- 
mainder with a little flour rubbed to a smooth paste with cold 
milk, and add a very little sugar. Onions may be stewed with 
the carrots, but in this case omit the sugar, and add pepper. — • 
[E. K., Mass. 



50 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Carrot Fritters 

Mash 2 boiled carrots, add 2 beaten eggs, 3 tablesp flour 
moistened with a little cream, and 1 teasp sugar. Drop by- 
spoonsful in hot fat and fry brown, like doughnuts. Serve 
hot and just before serving squeeze a little lemon or orange 
juice over each fritter, and dust with powdered sugar. — [S. 
E. W., O. 

Carrots and Peas 

Boil 1 pt carrots cut in dice, in enough water to cover, and 
after 10 minutes add 1 pt shelled green peas, and boil all 
together until tender. When done the water will be greatly- 
reduced. Then add V2 cup cream, a little butter, pepper and 
salt, and thicken with a little corn starch or flour. Let boil 
2 or 3 minutes longer and serve. — [Mrs. H. H., Cal. 

Smothered Carrots and Onions 

Cut salt pork in small cubes and fry light brown, then add 
1 doz onions, and as many tender carrots, cut fine. Season 
well with salt and pepper, add 1 cup water, cover, and cook 
1 hour. — [Mrs. A. B., Me. 

Pickled Carrots 

Wash and scrape carrots and cook in salted water until 
tender, then cut in pieces of convenient size, and cover with 
hot vinegar, which may be sweetened and spiced, if liked. 
Let stand in this vinegar 2 days, before using. — [Mrs. L. A. 
G., Me. 

Minced Beets 

Remove the greens and wash the beets clean, but do not 
peel nor cut off the root or stem ends. Plunge into boiling 
water and boil rapidly until tender, then plunge into cold 
water. The skins can easily be slipped off after this treatment. 
Slice or chop, discarding the coarse and fibrous parts, and for 
1 qt beets allow 2 tablesp butter, 2 tablesp sugar, salt to 
taste, and plenty of pepper, 2 to 4 tablesp vinegar, (according 
to taste), and 1 cup thin, sweet cream, poured over just 
before serving. Serve hot. — [L. R., Ind. 

Creamed Beets 

Cook until tender, then peel and chop coarsely. Add 1 cup 
cream to 1 qt beets, and season with salt and pepper. A little 
vinegar and sugar may be added, also some butter, and the 
creamed beets baked in the oven about 15 or 20 minutes.— 
tA. E. R., N. H. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 51 



Creamed or Ma^ed Turnips 

Peel turnips, then cut up in small dice, discarding all tough 
and stringy parts. Cover with cold water, add salt, and boil 
until tender, then drain. Prepare a cream sauce of butter and 
milk thickened with a little flour, add the boiled diced turnips 
with salt and pepper to taste, and serve at once, or mash the 
turnips after draining, and add pepper and salt and butter to 
taste. — [A. G., Mass. 

Creamed Parsnips 

Wash and scrape parsnip, slice lengthwise in inch pieces, 
add boiling water to cover, salt, and boil till tender. If there 
is too much liquid pour a little of it off and add 1 cup milk, 
a little butter, salt and pepper, with a dash of sugar, if liked, 
and fiour to thicken a little. — [Mrs. E. D., Ida. 

Fried or Baked Parsnip 

Boil 4 large parsnips until tender, then drain and mash, 
add salt and pepper, butter the size of an egg, 3 beaten eggs, 
% cup sweet cream, and some bread crumbs to bind together, 
and fry like fritters, or bake in the oven. — [Mrs. G. McM., Cal. 

Steamed Green Peas 

Peas should be picked when young and tender, and cooked 
as soon after picking as possible, or they will lose flavor and 
sweetness. Pill a cheese cloth bag about two-thirds full of 
the shelled peas, and place in a colander, hung into a kettle 
of boiling water, and cover closely, but do not let the water 
touch the peas. Steam until done, which will take a little 
longer than boiling, but the peas will be much finer and 
sweeter in flavor, than when boiled in water. When done add 
plenty of butter and a little salt, and serve, at once. — [Mrs. 
J. I. M., N. H. 

Lima Beans 

Fresh lima beans should be cooked immediately after gath- 
ering. Shell and cook till tender in water barely enough t© 
cover, allowing most of the water to boil away. Then add 
salt and pepper to taste, and 1 cup rich sweet cream, or some 
butter. — [Mrs. L. O. M.. O. 

Baked Peas 

This is a good recipe for the big, mealy peas. Parboil 1 qt 
ripe peas, then drain, and put in a bean pot with 1 lb salt 



52 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



pork, Vz teasp each pepper, salt, sugar and mustard, and enough 
cold water to cover the peas. Bake about 8 hours. — [Mrs. L. 
A. G., Me. 

Mashed (dried) Peas or Beans 

Soak 1 qt dried peas or beans in plenty water over night. 
Next morning drain and put them in a kettle with boiling 
water and boil 1 hour, then drain, add fresh boiling water, 
and boil 3 hours, after which mash through a colander, add 
butter, salt and pepper to taste, and a little thyme. Serve with 
browned onions. Nice served with ham and sauerkraut.—" 
[N. P., N. H. 

To Cook String Beans 

Cook immediately after gathering, wash and snap in small 
pieces and remove strings if there are any. Put on in cold 
water barely enough to cover, cover closely, and cook slowly 
until tender, adding a little butter or drippings and salt to 
taste. Another way is to boil them with salt pork. Do not 
use any more water than necessary. — [A. G., Mass. 

Baked Beans 

Soak 1 qt white beans in cold water over night (15 or 16 
hours is none too long). Next morning drain, cover with cold 
water, boil V2 hour, then add a pinch of soda, and let boil, 
uncovered, until skins crack; then drain. Meanwhile boil 
y2 or % lb salt pork about 20 minutes, then cut deep gashes 
crisscross in the top fat of the pork, and put the pork and 
the parboiled beans in a bean pot, so that the cut pork will 
be even with the top of the beans; also put 1 small onion, 
peeled, in with the beans. In a large cup mix i/^ teasp ground 
mustard, 1 teasp salt, and V2 teasp pepper, with V2 cup molas- 
ses (or less), thinned with some of the liquor in which the pork 
was cooked, pour over the beans, (the liquid should almost 
come to the top of beans), and bake slowly about 8 hours. 
Tomato juice can be added instead of meat liquor. The bean 
pot should be of earthenware, and deep. If the liquid evap- 
orates too rapidly, add a very little hot water from time to 
time. During the last half hour increase the heat so that the 
top of the beans and the pork may brown nicely. Long soak- 
ing in cold water and long, slow baking are essential to suc- 
cess. — [A. G., Mass. 

Stuffed Cucumbers 

Peel large cucumbers, cut in half lengthwise, and remove 
seeds and soft pulp. Prepare a filling of 1 cup each minced 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 53 



cold chicken and bread crumbs, 1 teasp each minced parsnip 
and onion, 1 tablesp melted butter, 2 tablesp cream, and salt 
and pepper to taste. If filling seems too stiff, add more 
cream. Pack this filling heaping full into the cucumber boats. 
Place side by side in a baking dish, and pour around them 
some well seasoned stock or gravy, or a little hot water and 
butter. Cover and bake Vz hour, then uncover and brown. 
Remove the cucumbers to a heated platter, thicken the gravy 
in the pan with a little browned flour, pour around the cucum- 
bers, and serve at once. — [Mrs. E. E. S., Pa. 

Fried or Baked Squash 

Peel tender squash, cut in strips as long and thick as the 
finger, sprinkle with pepper and salt, roll in flour, and fry 
brown in hot drippings, then cover and cook slowly until 
tender. — [E. E. K., Me. 

Peel a round squash, cut a piece from the stem end, and 
remove the seeds and stuff the cavity with a filling made of 
bread crumbs, hard boiled eggs, cold ham, or some other kind 
of meat, and 1 beaten egg. Dot the top with butter, return 
the cover to the squash, put in baking pan with just enough 
water to keep from burning, and bake until tender. Squash 
is also nice cooked with a roast of meat, same as potatoes. — * 
[Mrs. P. J. S., Tex. 

Escalloped Squash 

Peel, remove seeds, and boil and mash squash. When cool 
add 2 beaten eggs, ^ cup milk, butter, and pepper and salt 
to taste. Pour into a buttered baking dish, cover with bread 
crumbs, dot with butter, and bake. Serve hot. — [M. B., 111. 

Cooked Celery 

Trim and cut celery stalks in small pieces, reserving the 
tender inner parts to serve raw, and the greens for soup. 
Boil until tender in no more water than necessary, then season 
with salt and pepper, add butter and milk, and slightly thicken 
the gravy with a little flour. — [Mrs. J. L. R., O. 

Celeriac 

Not all housewives are acquainted with the turnip-rooted 
celery, or celeriac, which is generally used for soups and 
stews. Here is another way. Pare and slice the root, add a 
medium sized onion, sliced thin, and boil till tender, then 
add a cream sauce, and let simmer on back of the range a 
few minutes, until ready to serve. — [Miss M. W., Mass.

To Cook Asparagus 

Tlie usual way is to cook asparagus uncut, in water to cover, 
but in this way you are obliged to cook the tender beads just 
as long as the tough stalks. This is my way: Cut off all the 
tops and an inch or so of the tender top stalk, and lay these 
aside, then peel the bottom stalks, cut in one-inch lengths, and 
stew slowly % hour, adding a small pinch of soda, then add 
the tops and boil 10 or 15 minutes longer. Season with pepper 
and salt, and add butter and cream.^[Mrs. C. J., Ct. 

Egg Plant Ways 

Peel egg plant and cut in slices i/^-inch thick, sprinkle 
lightly with salt and let stand V2 hour, after which dip them 
in beaten egg, then in flour, and fry brown on both sides. — 
[Miss A. E. H., Pa. 

Cut egg plants in half, scrape out the inside and put in a 
saucepan with 2 tablesp minced ham, water to cover, and boil 
until soft then drain, add 2 tablesp bread crumbs, 1 tablesp 
butter, 1/^ an onion, minced, V2 teasp salt, and a dash of 
pepper. Stuff each half of the egg plant with this mixture, 
top oft with 1 teasp butter, and bake 15 minutes. — [Mrs. K. 
R. P., Tex. 

Pare and cut an egg plant in slices %-inch thick, cover 
with water, add a little salt, and stew until tender. Then 
drain, mash with a fork, add 2 beaten eggs, 4 tablesp sweet 
cream, a small pinch cayenne pepper, and flour enough to make 
a batter that will drop from a spoon, sifted with 1 teasp 
baking powder. Drop by spoonsful into hot lard or drippings, 
and fry brown on both sides. Serve with powdered sugar. — 
[Mrs. J. J. R. 

Boiled or Fried Rutabaga 

Peel and slice rutabaga, add water to cover, salt and pepper, 
1 tablesp lard, and a small pinch soda. Cook until tender, 
then remove cover^ and fry brown. — [C. O., N. D. 

Peel and slice rutabaga i/^-inch thick, and boil in slightly 
salted water until tender; then drain, roll in flour, and fry in hot 
drippings, adding salt and pepper to taste. — [Mrs. L. S., Minn. 

Baked Salsify or Oyster Plant 

Scrape and slice the salsify and cook till tender in slightly 
salted water. Then put in buttered baking pan alternate layers 
of bread crumbs and salsify, seasoning each layer with salt, 
pepper and butter. Fill the pan half full of sweet milk, and 
then add sweet cream until nearly full. Cover the top with 
bread crumbs, and dot with butter. Bake in a hot oven. A 
very little sugar added to the salsify is liked by some. — [Mrs. 
G. G., Mo.

Stewed Radishes 

WaBh and scrape 3 or 4 bunches white radishes, cut in 
small pieces, cover with water, add a little salt and sugar, boil 
until tender, then drain, mash and add a little butter and 
cream. We like this better than turnips. — [Mrs. P. H. J., Ore. 

Stuffed Peppers 

Remove seeds from 6 large, sweet peppers. Put over the 
fire in cold water, bring to the boiling point, and then drain. 
Repeat this twice. Prepare a filling of 1 cup each boiled rice, 
cold meat, chopped fine, and tomatoes, cut fine, and V2 cup 
bread crumbs. Season with salt, pepper and onion. Fill the 
parboiled peppers with this mixture, sprinkle the tops with 
bread crumbs, and dot with butter. Bake in brisk oven % 
hour. Another way is to cut the parboiled peppers in slices, 
dip in a batter and fry brown on both sides. — [Mrs. D. D. 
P., Cuba. 

Creamed Raw Cabbage 

Select a solid and tender head of young cabbage and shave 
fine. Make a cream sauce of ^/^ cup thick, sweet, or sour 
cream, 1 tablesp sugar, 1 or 2 tablesp vinegar, and 2 tablesp 
fresh fried ham drippings. Beat this until foamy, then pour 
over the shaved cabbage, adding salt and pepper to taste. Nice 
to serve with roast pork and mashed potatoes. — [Mrs. P. B., 
N. Y. 

Escalloped Cabbage 

Trim a nice, tender head of cabbage, cut in quarters, and 
cook in slightly salted water about 20 minutes, then drain, 
chop fine, and mix with a dressing made of 4 tablesp butter, 
creamed with 4 tablesp flour, and 1 qt hot milk, stirring con- 
stantly, and when the flour is done add 6 hard-boiled eggs, 
chopped fine, and salt and pepper to taste. Turn the cabbage 
and cream mixture into a buttered baking pan, sprinkle the 
top with bits of butter and bake in a quick oven about 15 min- 
utes. — [Mrs. H. J. H., Col. 

Stuflfed Cabbage 

Trim off the outer leaves and remove the heart from a fine 
head of tender young cabbage, so as to leave a shell of cabbage 
about 1 inch thick. Fill the cavity with cold, chopped chicken, 
veal, pork or beef, mixed with a little cold chopped potatoes, 
if liked, also the beaten yolk of an egg, and seasoned well with 
salt and pepper. Cover with several crisp cabbage leaves well 
tucked in at the top, tie in cheese cloth, and boil 2 hours. — • 
[Mrs. J. D. C, Cal. . 



56 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Stewed Red Cabbage 

Trim a small head of red cabbage and shavo -^ne. Put into 
a granite kettle 1 heaping tablesp lard or drippings, and when 
hot put in the shaved cabbage, and a small onion pierced with 
3 or 4 whole cloves, 1 teasp salt, 1 tablesp sugar, % cup 
boiling water, and scant i/4 cup vinegar. Cover closely and 
Btew slowly about 2 hours, stirring often to prevent scorching. If 
it seems to get too dry add a little more boiling water. White 
cabbage may be prepared the same way, omitting the cloves 
and sugar, and adding Yz teasp caraway seeds, if that flavor 
is liked.— [Mrs. G., Wis. 

Hot Slaw 

Put some drippings into a deep frying pan, and when hot 
add finely shaved raw cabbage, and mix thoroughly. When 
the fat has become well mixed with the cabbage, cover the 
pan closely and set on the side of the range to simmer slowly 
until tender. The steam will furnish suflicient moisture, but 
if there is danger of scorching, add a very little hot water. 
About 15 minutes before serving add pepper, salt and vinegar 
to taste. — [A. G., Mass. 

Stewed Cauliflower 

Select a nice, fresh head of cauliflower, break it apart, trim 
the stem ends carefully, and let stand a few minutes in cold, 
slightly salted water, then drain and put in a granite stew pan 
with cold, slightly salted water, and let boil till tender. It 
is a good plan to tie the cauliflower in a net, so that it can be 
lifted out of the boiling water when done, without breaking 
the flower. Prepare a cream sauce of milk and butter, thicken 
with a little flour, and season with salt and pepper. A beaten 
egg, may be added, if liked. Pour this over the cauliflower, 
and serve at once. — [Mrs. M. M. B., Mo. 

To Cook Sauerkraut 

Wash sauerkraut in cold water to freshen just right to 
taste, then put on 1 qt saukerkraut with % cup lard or drip- 
pings and a little water to prevent scorching. Cover closely and 
stew slowly until tender, adding a very little hot water if 
necessary. It is a mistake to wash the sauerkraut too much 
or to parboil it as this leaves nothing but a wilted, tasteless 
mass. Plenty of fat and slow boiling are necessary. Serve 
^ith boiled or roast pork, and mashed potatoes. — [A. G., Mass.

Creamed Onions 

Take young onions before they are full grown, cut off tops 
and roots, peel, and boil in slightly salted water until tender; 
then drain. Make a cream sauce of milk, butter and beaten 
egg, thickened with a little flour, and seasoned with salt and 
pepper. Cook until smooth, and then pour over the boiled 
onions. When the onions are older and stronger, the first 
water, after boiling 5 minutes, should be poured off and the 
onions boiled in fresh water until tender. — [Mrs. G. W., N. Co 

Fried Spring Onions 

Fry a few slices of bacon or salt pork until well browned, 
then remove from the pan and put into the hot fat green 
onions, cut up into inch lengths. When the onions are well 
fried push them to one side of the pan and add about 1 
tablesp flour to the gravy, and when smooth add 1 pt boiling 
water. Mix well, boil 1 minute, then serve. — [Mrs. H, L., Va. 

Baked Onions 

Peel large onions and boil 1 hour in slightly salted water, 
th-en drain and put them in a shallow buttered baking dish, 
sprinkle with pepper and salt, dot each onion with butter, 
pour a little milk in the pan, cover the onions with bread 
crumbs, and bake slowly 1 hour. Another way is to put 
alternate layers of onions and bread crumbs in a pudding dish, 
season with pepper, salt, and butter, and moisten with milk. — » 
[N. P., N. H. 

Onion GraTy 

Peel and slice fine 2 onions and let them simmer in a pan 
with 3 or 4 tablesp lard or drippings, until tender, taking care 
not to burn. Then add 2 or 3 level tablesp flour, salt and pepper 
to taste, and 2 cups milk. Let come to a boil, then add 1 
well-beaten egg. — [Mrs. H. A. S., Ala. 

Boiled or Baked Spinach 

Pick and wash spinach carefully and boil aoout 15 or 20 
minutes. It will require very little water, if any, as greens 
boil down very much, and the water which clings to the leaves 
after washing is almost enough to cook them. When done 
pour in a colander to drain, chop lightly, and pick out all the 
tough stem ,parts. Return to the kettle with butter and salt 
and pepper to taste, or use the frying fat from ham. Heat 
thoroughly and serve at once with a garnish of hard-boiled 
eggs, sliced. Another way is to put the boiled spinach in a 



58 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



buttered baking dish, slice the hard-boiled eggs on top, cover 
with a cream sauce, sprinkle with grated cheese, and pepper 
and salt, then with a layer of bread crumbs, dot with bits of 
butter, and bake until brown. — [A. G., Mass. 

Dandelion, Cowslip, and Dock 

The leaves, stalks and buds of cowslips can be used. Wash 
and pick over carefully, parboil about 10 minutes in boiling 
water, to which add V2 teasp soda, then drain, and boil until 
tender with some lean salt pork. Just before serving, add 
vinegar, salt and pepper. Dandelions should be picked before 
blossoming time. Wash, and discard the little stems or 
buds that would turn to blossoms, boil until tender, then drain 
and season with salt, pepper and butter. Use the leaves only 
of narrow dock, and prepare the same as cowslips. The addi- 
tion of a few horseradish leaves is an improvement. — [Mrs. 
G. M. N., N. Y. 

Swiss Chard 

When the leaves are large and plenty of stalk or stem, 
strip the leaves from the stems, and treat the latter as follows: 
Cut in short pieces and cook with a very little water until the 
stalks are tender and the water has almost all boiled away. 
Then pour over as much milk as you want soup, bring to a 
boil, thicken with a little cornstarch, add 1 or 2 well-beaten 
eggs, with seasoning to taste. This tastes like oyster soup. 
The greens can be boiled the same as spinach. — [Mrs. C. I. D., 
Cal. 

Beet Greenis 

Cut % lb cold boiled ham in dice and fry in 1 tablesp butter 
with V2 an onion minced fine, then add 2 tablesp hot vinegar, 
and pour this sauce over beet greens which were boiled in hot 
salted water until tender, and then drained and chopped fine. 
Serve hot with poached eggs on top of the greens. — [Mrs. C. 
J. M., Neb. 

Okra Ways 

Cut the stems from 1 qt okra and cut the pods into pieces 
% inch thick; add 1 pt tomatoes, and 1 cup corn cut from the 
cob, and cook until tender. Season with butter, salt and pep- 
per. Another way is to take the small tender pods of okra, 
Btem and wash, and while wet, roll in flour, sprinkle with salt 
and fry in hot fat. For a stew put the okra on with enough 
hot water to cover, and when well done, drain, and season 
to taste with pepper, salt, butter and vinegar. — [A. G., Mass, 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 59 



Gumbo is made by taking equal quantities of young okra 
chopped fine, ripe tomatoes peeled and chopped, 1 or 2 onions, 
minced, a lump of butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Add 
1 or 2 tablesp water if necessary, and stew until tender. — 
[Mrs. P. A. D., 111. 

This is the way I prepare okra. To 1 qt okra add 1 qt 
tomatoes, 6 onions, 3 green peppers, and 3 or 4 slices of bacon. 
Boil until done, season with salt and pepper. — [P. J. S., Tex. 

Peel onions under water to prevent the shedding of teafs. 
To kill onion and cabbage odor while cooking, set a small, 
open dish of vinegar on. the back of the stove. — [A. G., Mass. 

Salad Garnishes 

A.lmost anything in the line of fresh greens, potatoes, vege- 
tables, fruits, fish, meat, nuts, etc., can be dished up as salad 
and make a very presentable as well as palatable dish, with 
the aid of a nice salad dressing and garnishes. It is well to 
have some prepared salad dressing always ready to hand — 
stored in glass fruit jars it will keep some time in a cool place. 
If too thick, thin with cream. For garnishes use crisp leaves 
of lettuce, parsley, or celery, slices of lemon, red beets cut in 
fancy shapes, radishes, hard-boiled eggs, slices of cucumber, or 
small pickles cut in half lengthwise. The ingenious cook with 
an eye to the beautiful can easily convert whatever material 
she may happen to have at hand to decorative purposes. 



Salad Dressings 

French Dressing: To ^ teasp salt add % teasp pepper, a 
few grains of cayenne, a very little mustard, 6 tablesp olive oil, 
and 3 to 6 tablesp lemon juice or vinegar, according to taste. 
Put together in the order named, adding the oil and vinegar 
gradually, and beating well, until all the ingredients are well 
combined. A little onion juice may be added, if liked. — [A. 
G., Mass. 

Cream Dressing: Mix well together ^ cup each sour cream, 
sugar and vinegar, with a dash of salt, using a little more sugar 
if the cream and vinegar are very sour, or diluting the latter 
with a very little water. Nice for lettuce. — [E. L., Neb. 

Cabbage Dressing: Boil together a few minutes % cup each 
sugar and vinegar, and V2 tablesp butter, then add 1 cup sour 
cream and 1 beaten egg, and boil a few minutes longer. Let 
get cold. — [L. P., 111.

Piquant Dressing: Rub together % cup butter and 1 heap- 
ing tablesp flour, add 2 tablesp sugar, 1 teasp salt, ^A teasp 
each mustard and pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper, and

slowly until it thickens. Will keep a long time. Nice for 
any salad.— [Mrs. W. A. M., O. 

Egg Dressing: Mix together 2 tablesp sugar, 1 tablesp corn- 
starch, 1% teasp mustard and V2 teasp salt. Heat 1 pt milk 
to the boiling point, add 2 tablesp butter, stir in 2 beaten eggs 
with the above dry ingredients, and lastly add 1 cup vinegar. 
Beat and stir well to prevent curdling while cooking. Will 
thicken like custard. When cold put in glass fruit jar. — [Mrs. 
M. M., Wis. 

Mustard Dressing: Mix well 1 cup sugar, % cup flour, 1 

teasp salt, and V2 lb mustard. Rub to a smooth paste with a 
little cold vinegar, then add gradually the remainder of 3

Should be the consistency of thick cream. — [L. P., Neb. 

Mayonnaise Dressing: Mix together % teasp each salt and 
mustard and 1 teasp powdered sugar, add the raw yolks of 2 
eggs, and V2 teasp vinegar, then, drop by drop, % cup olive 
oil, stirring vigorously, and as the mixture thickens, add 
gradually, alternating with the oil, 1 tablesp each vinegar and 
lemon juice. Have all ingredients cold and beat the mixture 
constantly. — [Mrs. D. W. R., Mich. 

Boiled Mayonnaise: Beat 2 raw eggs, add 2 tablesp each 
sugar and butter, ^2 teasp mustard, ^ teasp salt, a little white 
pepper, and 8 tablesp vinegar. Boil until it thickens, stirring 
constantly. Nice for vegetable salad. For fruit salad use 
more sugar and dilute the vinegar with water. Thin with 
cream when ready to use. Adding whipped cream makes it 
nice and fluffy. — [Mrs. J. W. Van B., Wis. 

Potato Salad 

Tha potatoes must be cold, and not too soft or mealy. Cut 
in dice or slices. Add a little finely minced onion, if liked, 
and if obtainable, crisp, tender celery, cut fine. Use any pre- 
ferred dressing — French or mayonnaise, and garnish dish with 
a "frill" of lettuce leaves, inside of that a "chain" of sliced, 
hard-boiled eggs, then cubes or diamonds of red beets, varied 
with tiny tips of parsley, and a few slices of cucumber, pickles, 
or lemon. — [A. G., Mass.

Cabbage Salad 

Shave about 1 qt white cabbage and sprinkle lightly with 
salt. Cut ^ lb smoked ham in dice, and fry brown and crisp; 
then add V2 cup cider vinegar and when thoroughly heated 
through turn over the shaved cabbage, to which has been added 
1 finely minced onion; add pepper to taste. Another way is 
to use half cabbage and half cold boiled potatoes, or half cab- 
bage and half celery, with any preferred cold dressing. — * 
[Mrs. F. B., N. Y. 

Vegetable Salad 

For this» all sorts of mixed vegetables can be used, such as 
boiled peas, beans, beets, carrots, potatoes, raw cucumbers, to- 
matoes, cabbage, celery, onions, and even a few tart apples. 
Use any preferred dressing, serve on a platter of lettuce 
leaves, and garnish with hard-boiled eggs. Exact quantities 
cannot be given — the skill of the cook must be called into play, 
for the "blending" is a nice art. — [A. G., Mass. 

Meat Salad 

Chicken, turkey, ham, veal — in fact, any boiled meat can be 
made up into nice salads. Trim and cut up in small pieces, 
add potatoes and celery, or cabbage, or cucumbers, also cut 
in small pieces, mix with any preferred dressing and garnish 
with lettuce, pickles and hard-boiled eggs. — [A. G., Mass. 

Fish Salad 

Salmon, herring, sardines, or almost any fish, also crabs and 
lobsters, make excellent salad. Mix with chopped cabbage, 
celery, cucumbers or pickles, hard-boiled eggs and potatoes, all 
cut to uniform size, and use any preferred dressing and gar- 
nish. A nice herring salad is made as follows. Soak 1 doz 
salt herrings in water over night, and next morning wash again 
and cut fine, add 1 doz large, tart apples and V2 doz large, 
white onions, 3 lbs boiled veal or chicken, scant Vz cup sugar,

some minced sardines, ham or chicken, seasoning to taste, and 
return to the white boats, with a spoonful of dressing on each. 
[A. G., Mass. 



62 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Tomato Salad. 

Sliced tomatoes and cucumbers make a nice salad, witli a 
French dressing. Should be served immediately after mixing, 
and be real cold. Another way is to peel ripe tomatoes with 
a sharp knife, cut a slice off stem end, carefully scoop out the 
pulp, and mix same with chopped cucumbers and a dressing, 
and return to the tomato shells. — [A. G., Mass. 

Wilted or Dutch Lettuce 

Trim and clean and break apart 2 or 3 crisp heads of 
lettuce, slice in 4 or 5 green onions with the tender stalks, 2 
or 3 boiled potatoes, 2 or 3 hard-boiled eggs, and sprinkle with 
salt and pepper. Cut about 2 oz fat salt pork in small cubes 
and fry crisp, then add 1 cup vinegar, let it boil up and pour 
it over the lettuce mixture and mix well with a wooden fork 
and spoon. Tender young dandelion greens can be used the 
same way. — [Mrs. G. M. N., N. Y. 

Waldorf Salad 

Chop or cut fine 1 bunch of tender, crisp celery, the same 
Quantity of fine flavored apples, add 1 cup walnut meats, cut 
small (or any other nuts, even chestnuts, boiled) and mix with 
any preferred salad dressing. This is most delicious. — [A. G., 
Mass. 

Banana Salad 

Take large, ripe bananas, peel and cut in half lengthwise. 
Allow one piece for each person, and place on crisp lettuce 
leaf. Put 2 tablesp ground salted peanuts on the banana, and 
cover all with a thick mayonnaise dressing, containing but little 
mustard, but plenty cream. Delicious. — [E. M. B., Mich. 

Fruit Salads 

Almost an unlimited variety of delicious fruit salads may be 
made in combination with the following foundation: Soak 1 
tablesp clear granulated gelatine in 1 cup cold water and add 
1 cup sugar. If you have fruit juice of any kind on hand, put 
1 pt over fire to heat to the boiling point, and pour on the 
soaked gelatine, and stir until dissolved. If you have no fruit 
juice, use water, then pour over the fruit and put in a cool 
place to harden. Delicious frait combinations are: Oranges, 
bananas and pineapple, or grated pineapple alone, or grated 
pineapple and chopped nuts, or canned cherries alone, or 
canned peaches, canned pears, and pineapple, or pineapple and 
strawberries, or any combination of the above, and canned 
apricots, raspberries, or indeed, any fruit. I save the juices 
from canned fruits when I make pies, to use to dissolve the 
gelatine, or when canned fruits are used for the salad, pour 
off the juice and use it in this way. Serve fruit salad with 
whipped cream. — [Mrs. C. W. K., 111. 




PaddiitfSs, Gustards and Sweet Sauces 

HEN fruit is plentiful puddings appear 
often as dessert on well supplied farm 
tables, and at all seasons puddings, when 
well made and not too rich, afford whole- 
some and favorite variety to the daily bill 
of fare. Every cook will surely be able to 
find among the following extensive collection of 
recipes something to suit her culinary resources and the 
family taste. The same recipes can frequently be used by 
substituting some other fruit, or varying the flavor. There 
are tricks in all trades, and a clever cook can manage to 
make occasional changes to suit herself, without impairing 
the result. 

Apple Pudding 

To 1 cup cream add 1 beaten egg, 2 teasp baking powder, 
and a little salt sifted with flour enough to make a thick bat- 
ter. Lastly stir in about ^^ doz large apples chopped fine. 
Bake in moderate oven. The hardest winter apples can be 
used as long as they are chopped fine enough and the pudding 
is baked slowly. Sour cream and 1 teasp soda can be used if 
preferred, in that case omitting baking powder. Serve with a 
sweet sauce. — [Mrs. I. M. C, Wash. 

Crab Apple Pudding 

Core the apples and stew until soft in a syrup made of sugar 
and water. Do not have more syrup than the apples will take 
up, but be careful not to let the latter burn. When they are 
done, put them in a buttered pudding dish, and if they are not 
quite sweet enough, add sugar to taste. Make a soft batter of 
1 pt flour, 2 teasp baking powder, and milk. Turn this over 
the apples, cover the dish, and steam about 1% hours. Serve 
with cream. Another good way is to cover the apples with a 
thick custard made of milk, egg yolks, cornstarch and sugar, 
using the whites to make a meringue for the top. — [N. P., N. H. 

Dutch Apple Pudding 

Make a stiff batter of 2 cups flour sifted with 2 teasp baking 
powder, % cup butter, 1 egg, 1 scant cup milk, 2 tablesp sugar, 

63

with sugar and cinnamon, and bake about 30 minutes. Serve 
with cream and sugar. — [Mrs. E. E. S., Pa. 

Apple Slump

lemon, 1 cup sugar, and butter the size of a small egg. Place 
in a hot oven and then make a rich cream biscuit crust. Cut 
in small rounds with a tin box about size of a 50-cent piece, 
or if you have no such cutter handy, pinch off little pieces of 
the dough, flatten with the hands, and lay these little biscuits 
over the apples, closely together, but not overlapping. Cover 
the pudding dish, and when the pudding is nearly done, remove 
the cover to brown the biscuits. Serve hot with cream or any 
perf erred sauce. — [Mrs. K. C, Mo. 

Baked Apple Roll 

Make a dough of 1 qt flour, 1 teasp salt, 2 teasp baking pow- 
der, 2 tablesp butter, and 1 pt milk. Roll out about % inch 
thick, and spread with chopped apples. Roll up and pinch the

in a baking pan with % cup butter, 2 cups sugar and 3 cups 
water. Bake about 1 Vz hours. This will make its own sauce. 
— [Mrs. D. H. H., Ida. 

Boiled Apple Roll 

Make a dough of 1 qt flour, 1 tablesp lard, a little salt, and 
1 teasp soda, mixed with sour milk enough to make a dough 
that will roll. Roll about i/4 inch thick, cover well with finely 
sliced apples, sprinkle with sugar and a little nutmeg or cin- 
namon, and roll up, carefully pinching the ends together to 
prevent the escape of juice. Put this roll in a well floured bag, 
and boil out one hour. The water must be boiling when the 
pudding is put in, and must continue to boil without interrup- 
tion until the pudding is done. Any other fruit may be substi- 
tuted for apples. Serve with any preferred sauce. — [Mrs. R. 
T. B., N. C. 

Baked Brown Betty- 
Grate some dry bread quite fine and pare and core apples 
and chop fine. Butter a baking dish, put in a layer of bread 
crumbs, then a layer of apples, sprinkle with sugar, and a lit- 
tle nutmeg or cinnamon, dot with bits of butter, and alternate 




o

in this way until the dish is filled. If the apples are not very 
juicy moisten with a little water. Bake until the apples are 
done and the pudding is brown on top. The top layer should 
be of bread crumbs, sprinkled with sugar and dotted with but- 
ter. Serve warm with cream. — [Mrs. G. O. F., N. H. 

Peach Pudding 

Fill a pudding dish with whole peeled peaches, pour over 
them 2 cups water, cover closely and bake until tender. Then

juice 1 pt sweet milk, 3 or 4 well-beaten eggs, 1 cup sugar, 1 
tablesp melted butter, and 1 cup flour sifted with 1 teasp bak- 
ing powder and a little salt. Beat well and pour this batter 
over the peaches in the pudding dish. Bake a rich brown and 
serve with cream. — [Mrs. W. K., Cal. 

Orange Pudding 

Make a boiled custard of eggs, milk and cornstarch, sweet- 
ened to taste. Put a layer of this in a dish, then a layer of 
sliced oranges, another of custard, and so on until the dish is 
filled. Chill, and serve with whipped cream. In preparing the 
oranges be sure to remove all the white particles of the peel 
and between sections, and be careful that no pits remain in the 
pieces. — [Mrs. H. M. C, Ind. 

Boiled Lemon Pudding 

Put over the fire in an agate vessel 2 V2 cups water or milk, 
and 1 cup sugar. When this is boiling stir into it 4 heaping 
teasp cornstarch dissolved in % cup water. Let this boil a few 
minutes, stirring constantly, then remove from fire and add 
the juice and grated rind of 3 lemons, the beaten yolks of 3 
eggs, and 1 teasp butter. Fill small preserve dishes with this 
mixture and let them stand a while to allow the pudding to 
thicken and get cold. When ready to serve top off each dish 
with a meringue made of the beaten whites of the eggs, pow- 
dered sugar, and a little lemon flavoring. — [Mrs. C. von W., 
N. J 

Frosted Lemon Pudding 

To 1 pt bread or cake crumbs (or both mixed) add 1 qt

a roasting pan, sprinkle with 1 cup sugar, dot with pieces of 
butter, and pour over all the juice of the plums, adding enough 
boiling water to almost cover the roll. Bake about V2 hour

too much sauce. Any other tart fruit can be substituted for 
plums. — [Mrs. M. R., Ida.

Stewed Whole Cranberries 

Use only the best ripe berries, discarding all the soft and 
inferior ones, which may be used for marmalade or strained 
sauce. Wash the berries, and then put them into a double 
boiler. In a separate vessel cook together for 10 minutes one- 
half as much sugar as you have berries, and half as much 
■water as sugar. Then pour this boiling syrup over the berries 
in the double boiler, and place the latter over a hot fire, and 
cook until the berries are done. This will take about 1 hour. 
Do not stir the berries, but from time to time press them down 
under the syrup, so that all may be equally cooked. Be care- 
ful that the water does not get too lov/ in the outside boiler. 
Cooked in this manner the skins do not separate from the 
pulp, and the cranberries apnear more like stewed cherries. — . 
[N. M. P., N. H. 

Cranberry and Apple Sauce 

To the desired amount of cranberries add one-half as much 
peeled apples, cored and quartered, and stew together until 
tender. Then remove from fire and let stand until nearly 
cold before adding sugar to. taste. It will not require nearly 
as much sweetening as when hot, and the apples impart a 
pleasant flavor, and also help to save sugar. If this sauce is 
rubbed through a sieve to remove the skins of the cranberries, 
it will be found to be a very pleasing as well as economical 
sauce to serve with meats of any kind. — [Mrs. E. B. L., Me. 

Cranberry Sauce (Jelly)

Rhubarb Sauce 

Wash the rhubarb (about 1 lb of it, if your family is small, 
for like apple sauce, it is better not to let it stand for any 
length of time), trim the tops, but do not peel as the red 
skins impart a fine flavor and color. Cut it up into pieces and 
to 3 cups rhubarb add 2 cups sugar but no water. Place on 
the back of the range until the sugar melts gradually and then 
cook slowly without stirring, until done. In this way the pieces 
will remain nice and whole. — [Mrs. C. C, N. Y.

2 cups water, and cook until tender. Then add 1 cup sugar

scorching. Press through a colander, add a dash of cinnamon, 
and if served hot, add 1 tablesp butter. A few thin shavings 
of lemon peel may be cooked with the apples. — [Mrs. A. C, 
W. Va. 

Boiled Cider Apple Sauce 

Pare, core and quarter 1 lb of "sweets," if you have them. 
If not, use any good sweet apples. I do not weigh or measure 
for this sauce, but pour over the apples the boiled cider 
reduced with a little water until it has a mild and pleasant 
flavor. Add sugar to taste and cook very slowly until apples 
can be pierced with a splint. Put up in cans or jars. It will 
keep nicely even if not sealed air tight. — [Mrs. G. G., N. Y. 




Pies and ShoMcakes 

LL rich pastry preparations are hard to 
digest, according to learned authorities, 
and therefore pie is not considered health- 
ful. But when pastry is prepared by a 
skillful cook, the discomforts, not to say 
dangers, which are supposed to attend its 
consumption, can be reduced to a mini- 
mum, by artful blending and sensible omissions. Rich 
crusts that in their composition call for equal parts of 
flour and butter or shortening, are rarely used in these 
days, because they are too rich, too indigestible and too 
expensive, and because we have found better ways of 
preparing acceptable substitutes. The chief requisites 
are that pie crust should be light and flaky, and not soggy 
and leathery, as some "counterfeits" are turned out. 
Much depends upon the pie filling, also, for dyspepsia 
often lurks in that delectable article, as Avell as in the 
greasy crust. It behooves each cook, therefore, to take 
careful note of the gastronomical idiosyncrasies of the 
family, and to wisely adjust her pastry selections and 
preparations accordingly. The following recipes would 
seem to offer a large enough variety in the line of pies 
and pastry to satisfy all tastes. They were sent in as. 
"tried and tested" by Orange Judd readers, and since the 
consumers lived to tell about the pies and such things 
that they prepared and ate, the recipes would seem to be 
safe for others to try. Take your choice. 

Suet Pie Crust 

To 2 cups flour add % teasp baking powder and a pinch of 
salt; then mix in V2 cup clear suet with a chopping knife 
until the whole is smooth and fine grained. Then add sweet 
milk to make a dough that can be rolled out. The suet should 
be measured after it has been clarified and cooled. — [Mrs. A.

one-half butter and one-half lard ) , using a chopping knife 
to cut through the flour, and lastly add about Vz cup cold 
water, or enough to make a stiff dough. Mix and handle 
as little as possible — only just enough to get it into shape and 
to roll it out. This amount will make two pies.— [Mrs. E. 
D., Ida. 

Flaky Pie Crust 

The rule that I follow for measuring for pie crust is always 
one-half the quantity of the previous ingredients. Thus 1 
cup flour, V2 cup lard, % cup water. The secret of having 
flaky pie crust is in chopping or cutting the different ingredi- 
ents together, always using a knife. In rolling out do not use 
any more flour than is absolutely necessary. Cut or chop 
the lard through the flour until the former is in pieces about 
the size of small beans. — [Mrs. G., Wis. 

Sweet Cream Pie Crust 

To 1 cup thick sweet cream add 1 tablesp sugar and mix this 
into 2 cups flour sifted with 1 teasp baking powder and a 
pinch of salt. This quantity is enough for two pies. — [Mrs. 
L. S., Minn. 

Sour Cream Pie Crust 

We think this is the most wholesome pie crust of any that 
we have tried. Dissolve 1 level teasp soda in 1 pt thick sour 
cream, and pour this mixture with a little salt added into 
sufficient flour to make a dough of the proper consistency. Roll 
into rather thin crusts. — [Mrs. A. C. W., W. Va. 

Egg Pie Crust 

Here is a wholesome pie crust that never fails me. To 1 
cup flour, add a pinch salt, i/^ teasp baking powder, 2 
tablesp sugar, 1 tablesp butter, and 1 tablesp lard. Work 
together thoroughly with a batter spoon, fork or knife, and 
then wet with 1 beaten egg. — [Mrs. P. A., Minn. 

Rich Puff Paste 

Into 1 lb flour cut or chop % lb butter, and add cold water 
enough to make a dough that can be rolled. Roll out on a 
board and gradually work in another % lb butter by spreading 
a little at a time over the crust, folding over, and rolling out 
again, repeating this operation half a dozen times or more, or 
until all the butter is used. Keep the dough as cold as possible 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



and if, while working, it seems to get too soft and warm, set 
it away for 10 or 15 minutes in an ice box, and finish rolling 
with butter after it is good and cold again. — [Mrs. P. A. B., 111. 

Baked Pie Crust 

All pie crust made of lard should be handled as little as pos- 
sible, in order that it may be tender and feathery. In mak- 
ing crusts to be used for lemon or cream pies, or any that have 
to be baked before the filling is put in, instead of the inside I 
cover the outside of my pie tins with the dough. Prick with a 
fork and turn the tin upside down to bake. In this way the 
crust will not shrink or puff as it is likely to do if put on the 
Inside. When done it can be slipped off and put inside and is 
then ready to fill. I use the same method when making tart 
shells in patty tins. — [Mrs. L. M, D., Mich. 

Mince Meat I

fruit cans. This will keep a long time. — [Mrs. M. A. B., Tenn. 

Mince Meat HI 

To 4 lbs beef, cooked and chopped, add 3 lbs chopped suet, 
8 lbs seeded raisins, 4 lbs currants, 8 lbs sugar, 16 lbs chopped

any kind fruit juice or jelly — sweet pickle or canned fruit juice 
— to make 1 gal, and 1 qt cider or vinegar. Mix well, boil up

and 1 teasp flour. Beat all well together and then stir in milk 
enough to fill a pie tin, lined with a good rich crust. Grate a

Dutch Pie 

Pare and cut in quarters sour apples that cook easily, and 
dispose these quarters in circles on a pie tin lined with a not 
too rich crust. Allow a large enough edge for the pie crust 
and crimp it with your fingers or a fork. Crowd in all the 
apples you can without allowing them to lay one on top of the 
other, then pour cold water over them to about half fill the 
tin. Next sprinkle over the apples sugar enough to sweeten to 
taste, and also a little cinnamon or nutmeg, if liked. Bake 
slowly. This pie is improved by dotting pieces of butter over 
the apples. — [Mrs. E. C. S., Mo.

meringue made from the egg whites and powdered sugar. This 
is sufficient for two pies. — [Mrs. F. D. D., N. Y. 

Squash Pie 

Pie made of good ripe squash can be just as delicious as 
pumpkin pie, and even better, to my mind. Peel the squash, 
scrape out pulp and seeds, cut in 2-inch pieces, and stew 
until tender in water to nearly cover, then pour in a colander 
and let all the water drain off. Mash thoroughly and to 3 qts 
squash, add 1 qt rich sweet milk, 6 well-beaten eggs, 2 tablesp 
corn starch wet with a little cold milk, 3 cups sugar (it should

taste quite sweet before baking), Yz a grated nutmeg, 2 teasp 
ginger, and 1 teasp cinnamon. Fill this mixture into deep plates 
lined with, a good, rich crust. Shake some cinnamon over the 
filling and bake in a good, steady oven until the center is firm 
and the crust nicely browned. — [R. A. McD., S. D. 

Green Pumpkin Pie 

Choose a green pumpkin just showing first yellow streaks; 
cook until tender, rub through a colander, and to each pint 
pumpkin pulp add % cup sugar, 1 tablesp butter, 1 tablesp 
flour, 3 tablesp vinegar, 1 teasp cinnamon and a little allspice, 
and 1 beaten egg. Bake between two crusts. This tastes very 
much like green apple pie. — [Mrs. J. T. C, Minn. 

Pumpkin Pie 

I can highly recommend this recipe. Pare, remove pulp, cut 
in small pieces, and cook pumpkin 5 or 6 hours, then strain 
carefully through a colander and for 4 cups strained pumpkin 
allow 4 cups rich milk, 4 well-beaten eggs, 1 heaping cup brown 
sugar, 1 teasp salt, i/^ a grated nutmeg, 2 teasp ginger and Vz 
teasp mace. The milk should be heated and added gradually 
to the seasoned pumpkin, stirring constantly, and lastly add 
the eggs well-beaten. Turn into deep pie plates lined with 
rich pastry. Be sure to have the pumpkin mixture hot. Bake 
to a rich brown; it will take about one hour. — [R. M., Mich.

and flavor with lemon or vanilla. Bake in an under crust, and 
when done cover with a meringue made of the whites of 3 eggs 
and powdered sugar. Return to the oven for a few minutes to 
brown lightly. I also make pumpkin pie by this recipe, by sub- 
stituting the same quantity of pumpkin for sweet potatoes. —

beaten eggs, and 1 cup butternut meats, chopped fine. Bake 
between two crusts. When eggs are scarce use 1 egg and 1 
teasp flour. — [Mrs. J. C. H., Vt. 

Cottage Cheese Pie 

To 1 cup cottage cheese add 1 cup sweet cream, 1 beaten egg, 
3 tablesp sugar, mixed with 1 tabiesp flour, a pinch of salt, and 
cinnamon to taste. Bake in an under crust. The cottage

bag, and hanging it up. When the whey has dropped out, mix 
the cheese smooth with a little sweet cream and salt it to 
taste. — [Mrs. E. C, Mo.

pour the mixture into a baked pie shell, and cover with a 
meringue made with the whites of the eggs and a little pow- 
dered sugar. Put in the oven a few minutes to brown lightly. 
When cold drop small lumps of jelly around on the top. — [M. 
F. P., N. Y. 

Fried Pies 

These are very nice and when fried just right, so as not to 
soak fat, are every bit as good as baked pies. Roll some 
biscuii dough quite thin, cut in small pieces of any desired size 
or shape, put on each piece a small spoonful of hot mince meat, 
fold the crust over and pinch the edges together securely all 
around so it will not open anywhere while frying, and fry 
these small individual mince pies in hot lard until a delicate 
brown, same as doughnuts. If you have never tasted any like 
these you have a real treat in store. — [I. A. S., Me. 

Fig Pie 

To 1 cup molasses add 1 cup sugar, the grated rind of 1 
lemon, % lb figs, cut fine, 2 cups water, 1 beaten egg, 2 tablesp

Strawberry Sauce for Shortcake 

Cream together 1 cup butter and 1 lb powdered sugar. 
Pick, wash and drain carefully 1 qt ripe strawberries and add 
these to the butter and sugar cream, crushing tbout three 
quarters of the berries. Have three layers of shortcake ready, 
spread the sauce between each layer and decorate the top 
with some whole berries. This should be prepared about 
half hour before serving. — [Mrs. C. von W., N. J. 

Strawberry Cobbler 

Sift 1 qt flour with 2 teasp baking powder and a pinch of 
salt. Cut % cup butter (or butter and lard mixed) into the 
flour and add sweet milk enough to make a dough that can 
be handled. Roll out a third of the dough, large enough to 
cover the baking pan you intend to use, and bake at once 
in a separate tin. This is to be used as a middle crust. 
Meanwhile roll out the rest of the dough to line a deep bak- 
ing pan, half fill with strawberries, sprinkle liberally with 
sugar, put on the baked middle crust and then finish filling 
the pan with berries, sprinkle with sugar, and cover the top 
with a crust, first cutting a number of air holes in it. Bake, 
and serve warm with sweetened cream. — [Mrs. B. B., la. 

Peach or Berry Cobbler 

Half fill an enameled pan, well buttered, with either berries 
or peaches cut fine, sprinkle with a liberal amount of sugar 
and dot generously with butter, lastly sprinkling with some 
flour. Cover the top with a layer of shortcake dough in 
which cut a few air holes. Bake in a moderately hot oven. — ^ 
[Mrs. W. W. P., Okla. 

Cranberry Mound 

Make a rich biscuit dough, roll out Vz inch thick, cut into 
four different sized circles, ranging from two to six inches. 
Cover each circle with a layer of finely chopped cranberries and 
a thick sprinkling of sugar, then place the larger circle on a 
well buttered plate, cover with the next smallest circle, and so 
on, the smallest circle coming on top. Set in a steamer and 
steam % hour. Serve with cream and sugar, or if preferred, 
a hot, sweet sauce. — [N. M. P., N. H. 

Cherry Rolls 

Roll out a rich biscuit dough about 1 inch thick, cover 
with ripe, pitted cherries (first draining off the juice), sprinkle 
plentifully with sugar, fold one side of the cake over the

other, to form a long narrow roll, pinch the edges, and then 
with a sharp knife cut off sections the size you wish to serve 
to each person. Lay these pieces in a bread pan, well but- 
tered, with the cut side up, and after all the pieces have been 
disposed of, drop lumps of butter over all and sprinkle with 
1 cup sugar and a very little flour. Then add the cherry 
juice and enough water to make a sufficient quantity of sauce. 
Bake until the crust is done. This is delicious. — [Mrs. W. 
T. G., Mo. 

Strawberry Rolls 

Roll out a rich biscuit dough about ^ inch thick, then 
spread with lightly crushed berries and sprinkle liberally 
with sugar. Roll up tight and pinch the ends closely together, 
so that no juice can escape. Place in a steamer and steam 
steadily for one hour. Cut in slices and serve with any pre- 
ferred sweet sauce. — [Mrs. M. P., N. H. 

Rhubarb Rolls 

Mix up a rich, short biscuit dough and roll out about V2 
inch thick, cover with a layer of finely cut raw rhubarb, 
sprinkle thickly with sugar, roll up, put it in a buttered tin 
and steam 40 minutes. Then put in a hot oven just long 
enough to dry off. Serve warm with a hard sauce. — [Mrs. N. 
P.. N. H. 

Cheese Straws 

To 4 tablesp grated cheese add 2 tablesp butter, 1 cup flour, a 
pinch salt, and cayenne pepper, and mix with a little cold water 
to the proper consistency. Roll about % inch th^.ck, cut in 
strips V2 inch wide and 3 inches long, and bake in a not too 
hot oven. — [Miss N. P., S. C. 

Cheese Patties 

Roll out in a sheet about % inch thick some ordinary pie 
flough and cut in triangular pieces. In the center of each 
place a spoonful grated cheese, sprinkled with a little pepper, 
lap one end of the dough over on the other, press the edges 
together with a fork and bake. — [Mrs. H. L., Va. 

Cocoanut Patties 

Boil together about 8 or 10 minutes 1 cup sugar and V2 pt 
boiling water, then add V2 cup grated cocoanut, and boil about 
8 minutes more, after which remove from the fire and add 2 
well-beaten eggs. Line little patty pans with ordinary pie 
crust, put a tablesp of the above mixture in each, and 
bake in a hot oven. — [Mrs. M. W., Me. 




Qakes, Fillings and Prostin^s 

OR cakes and in all branches of cookery it 
always pays to use the best and purest 
ingredients. Inferior flours, or cheap sodas, 
baking' powders, spices and extracts, inva- 
riably fail to give satisfaction, because more 
than the ordinary quantities are required, 
and because they are generally unpalatable, and, most im- 
portant of all, because they are positively injurious to 
health. If you must practice economy, do so in quantity, 
not quality — in other words, select plain recipes and leave 
the fancy and more elaborate combinations for special 
occasions. 

Some like cakes very sweet and rich, while others do 
not. In presenting the following recipes, the editor has 
tried to steer a middle course. It is understood that salt 
should be added to every cake, although it was not thought 
necessary to repeat this in every recipe. The amount of 
salt required will vary — less if salted butter is used, and 
more if lard or any other unsalted drippings are used. 

The recipes which follow were mostly furnished by 
Orange Judd readers, whose initials are signed. 
These recipes are all claimed to be tried and tested, and 
whatever else there may or may not be said of them, they 
certainly sound "tasty," and most of them have the addi- 
tional merit of being economical. The assortment includes 
plain and rich cakes, "raised" or yeast cakes, baking powder 
cakes, sour milk, buttermilk and soda cakes, eggless cakes, 
butterless cakes, fruit cakes, and various wholesome and 
palatable light and dark cakes, in loaves, layers, rolls and 
small cakes, together with all sorts of fillings and frostings. 
It would seem as though the variety would be large enough 
to suit all tastes.

General Directions for Baking Cake 

Measurements can be only approximately given, since flours 
vary in their capacity to absorb moisture, and every house- 
keeper does not measure with the same sized cv.^, or spoon. 
Therefore it will be necessary for each cook to experiment to 
some extent for herself. Bread flour should only be used for 
bread or yeast cakes, as it contains too much gluten, and is 
liable to make baking powder cakes too thick. Cups of dry 
ingredients are measured level, teaspoons or tablespoons should 
be rounded, while liquid measure should never be overflowing 
full. A complete table of weights and measures is given 
elsewhere in this book, also an index to the abbreviations used. 

Cake batters are usually mixed by first creaming together 
the butter and sugar, then adding the eggs, one at a time, and 
beating them well with the butter and sugar. Sometimes only 
the yolks are added, and the beaten whites at the very last. 
After the eggs, molasses, or milk, or whatever liquid the recipe 
calls for, is added, then the flour, in which the baking powder 
should first be mixed dry, and all sifted together before adding 
to the other ingredients. 

The seeded or seedless raisins and the currants should be 
thoroughly cleaned and lightly dredged with flour before adding 
to the batter, the very last thing. Citron and candied lemon 
peel or orange peel, as well as nut meats, should also be 
dredged with flour before adding to the batter. This prevents 
the fruit from sticking together and falling to the bottom of 

When sour milk is used in cake, it calls for about 1 teaspoon 
saleratus (soda) to each cup sour milk, or buttermilk — more 
or less soda, according to the acidity of the milk. Too much 
soda makes the cakes unpalatable, and causes the objectionable 
little brown spots. Sweet milk can be substituted for sour 
milk by omitting soda, and using baking powder instead. It 
usually requires about 1 to 1% teaspoons baking powder to 2 
cups flour. Also, sour milk can be substituted for sweet milk 
by omitting baking powder and adding a teaspoon soda to each 
cup sour milk. One cup sour milk with 1 teaspoon saleratus 
generally equals about 2 teaspoons baking powder in "raising" 
power. A good substitute for the "boughten" baking powder 
is made of cream of tartar combined with saleratus '«oda^ — 
two parts of the former with one of the latter. 

In dark cakes that call for butter, any gooa shortening 
can be substituted for the sake of economy — lard, chicken fat, 
or drippings, but none of strong flavor, such as goose or mut- 
ton, or any fat in which onions have been cooked. When try- 
ing a new recipe it is a good plan to measure the shortening 
and the sugar and molasses scant, until the individual family 
taste has been ascertained. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 99 



When cakes "fall" in the center while baking, or immedi- 
ately after removing from the oven, it is generally because the 
batter was too thin, or too rich with butter or molasses, or the 
baking was too rapid, so that a hard outer crust had formed 
before the center had solidified. It is for this same reason that 
the crusts will break, and the batter come up between, thus 
forming unsightly broken tops to the cakes. 

When the cake is thought to be about done, test it by 
inserting a broom straw with thick end cut to a fine point. If 
no moisture, or half baked batter adheres to the straw, the 
cake is done. Also, when the cake is done it usually recedes 
a little from the sides of the tin. After removing the cake 
from the oven never place in a draft or on a cold surface, but 
place the pan on a cloth or towel wrung out of water, and 
allow it to remain there a few minutes, after which the cake 
can be easily removed from the tin. The more delicate the 
cake, the more careful the handling should be. 

Cake pans are best greased with baking oil, or lard, never 
with salted butter, as the latter burns easily, and sometimes 
also causes the cake to stick to the tins. Some cooks like to 
sprinkle flour in the greased tins to prevent cakes from stick- 
ing. Sprinkle liberally and shake out superfluous flour by 
inverting the tin and tapping lightly on the outside. Another 
good plan is to place a fitted piece of well greased paper (white 
or light brown) in the bottom of cake pan, and sometimes also 
along the sides, especially for rich cakes that require long 
baking. 

Most cakes require medium heat in the baking, except when 
the recipe states otherwise. If the oven is too hot, a pan of 
cold water placed in it will help to reduce the temperature. As 
a rule, layer cakes and small cakes require a hotter oven than 
loaf cakes. Cakes made with baking powder call for a higher 
temperature than those in which cream of tartar and soda, or 
lemon juice and soda, or molasses and soda are used. Cakes 
made rich with the yolks of eggs require less heat than cakes 
made with the whites of eggs — that is, an oven should be hot- 
ter for an angel cake than for a yellow or rich and heavy cake. 
Cake containing fruit should always be baked in a slow oven. 

The regulation of the oven temperature spells success or 
failure in cake baking. As a general rule, the oven should be 
slow at first, and the heat gradually increased. Never attempt 
to bake a delicate cake mixture with a freshly built coal fire, 
which, as everyone knows, always gives out a more intense 
heat, or with a fire from which the life has largely died out. 
When the same recipe is used with success at one time and 
results in failure at another time the fault can generally be 
attributed to an oven of improper temperature. 

In mixing cakes lightened with yeast, observe the same 
points considered essential to success in bread making. On 
account of the tendency of sugar, butter and eggs to retard 



100 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



fermentation it is advisable to add these only to a light sponges 
or to a light bread dough. When filling cake tins the batter 
should never fill more than two-thirds of the space. Draw 
the mixture away from the center toward the corners or edges. 
If this is done, the cakes when baked will have level tops, pro- 
viding the oven was properly heated. 

It is a saving of time, and results will generally be more sat- 
isfactory, if, before beginning to mix a cake, the cook will see 
to it that she has everything needed ready at hand and in such 
condition that the ingredients can be put together quickly. 

Farmer's Cake 

When putting raised bread in pans to bake, leave out a 
piece about half the size of a loaf. Keep it in raiser and cover 
warm, while you get the following ready: 1 cup lard (melted, 
warm, not hot), 1 lb currants, i/^ lb raisins, 1^^ cups sugar, 1 
small cup molasses, 2 eggs, 1 teasp each ground cloves, ginger, 
allspice, cinnamon and soda. Mix the warm lard, beaten eggs 
and molasses and put in with dough. Then beat, and beat until 
it is light and like batter, after which add sugar and beat all 
again well. Lastly put in the floured fruit, but don't beat — 
just fold over and over until well mixed, and put in a roaster 
in a hot oven, and cover and bake for l^^ hours. Do not 
open oven door until cake is cooked. If your bread is ready 
to bake first, it does not hurt cake to leave it standing in warm 
place until oven is ready. This cake is very good and sub- 
stantial. — [Mrs. E. W., O. 

Wedding Cake 

I have prepared this for all my children when they were 
married, and everybody who has tasted this cake declares that 
it is unsurpassed. Cream 1 lb sugar and 1 lb butter (or use 
half butter and half shortening), add 12 eggs, one at a time, 
I lb sifted flour, 4 lbs raisins, seeded, 3 lbs currants, 2 lbs al- 
monds, blanched and chopped fine, and 1 cup raspberry jam. 
Put in a separate small bowl 1 or 2 nutmegs grated, 1 tablesp 
cinnamon, 1 teasp cloves, and pour over it 3 wine glasses 
good brandy and 2 wine glasses white wine. Cover the bowl 
and let this stand while you are mixing the cake, then stir it 
up, and pour it in the cake batter the very last thing. Mix 
well, and bake at once in a moderate oven. It is best to line 
the tin with well greased paper, and care must be used that the 
cake will not burn at the bottom. These cakes will keep a year 
or more. Do not bake : i too large tins. Use half the quanti- 
ties if less cake is wanted. — [Anon., N. Y. 

Angel Food Cake 

A moist and tender angel cake is one of the best things in 
the art of cookery. Remember that angel food should never be 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 101 

eaten the same day it is baked. It is better when a week old. 
The best that was ever baked will be tough when it is fresh. 
Keep in tightly closed tin box. The recipe which I have used 
with success is as follows: Add a pinch salt to the whites of 
9 eggs and beat till partly stiff, then add % teasp cream tartar 
and beat till very stiff. Fold in gradually and very carefully 
1% cups granulated sugar that has been sifted several times. 
Sift 1 cup best pastry flour half doz times, and fold lightly into 
the sugar and eggs. Lastly add 1 teasp vanilla extract, and 
pour the batter into an unbuttered pan which has been lightly 
dredged with flour. Bake for 35 to 50 minutes, and when done 
do not remove from pan until the cake is almost cold, after 
which it can be easily loosened and lifted out. — [H. E. S., Ind. 

Three In One Cake 

This recipe will answer for a French cream cake, a whipped 
cream cake, or a roll jelly cake. Beat 3 eggs and 1 cup sugar 
thoroughly, then add 2 tablesp cold water and li/4 cups flour 
sifted with 2 teasp baking powder. Always stir this batter 
in one direction. For a French cream cake bake in two round 
layers. Split the cakes, while warm, and put together with 
the following cream filling: Put 1 scant pt milk in a double 
boiler to heat. Dissolve 2 tablesp cornstarch in a little cold 
milk, add 1 beaten egg, and ^ cup sugar. Then pour this 
mixture into the hot milk and stir constantly until thick. Add 
piece of butter size of an egg, remove from the fire and flavor 
to taste, and spread between the layers. For the roll jelly cake 
bake in a long bread pan in a not too hot oven, or the edges 
will be hard and the cake will break when you try to roll it up. 
When done turn out on a clean towel, spread with jelly or 
jam, and roll up, leaving the cloth around the cake until it is 
cool. For whipped cream cake, bake in two round layers, split 
them while warm and put them together with sweetened 
whipped cream flavored to taste. This is best eaten fresh. — 
[Mrs. A. I., la. 

Fig Pound Cake

Bake in layers and put together with frosting made with the 
white of the egg and sugar, or use whipped cream. This is ex- 
cellent. — [L. A. B. 

Blackberry Jam Cake 

Cream l^^ cups sugar with y2 cup shortening, add 3 eggs, 
leaving out the white of one for the frosting, 14 cup sour milk, 
in which dissolve 1 scant teasp soda, 2^ cups flour sifted with 
1 teasp cinnamon, and last of all 1 cup of blackberry jam, mix- 
ing it no more than necessary after adding jam. Sweet milk 
may be used instead of sour milk by leaving out the soda and 
adding I teasp baking powder instead. This is a delicious 
cake. — [Miss E. C, Ore. 

Strawberry Jam Cake 

Cream V2 cup butter with 1 cup brown sugar, add yolks 
3 eggs, 5 tablesp sour milk or cream, in which dissolve 1 teasp

on cake. — {Mrs. J. S. D., N. Y. 

Here is a good substitute when cream is not at hand : Scrape 
or grate 1 good-sized apple into 1 cup of sugar. Keep on mix- 
ing to prevent the apple from turning dark, then add the 
beaten white of 1 egg and beat for about 20 to 30 minutes. Add 
vanilla flavor. — [Mrs. C. W. J., O.

two before cake is cut. — [E. L., Neb. 

Cook until it is thick and ready to candy, 2 cups brown 
sugar, ^2 cup thick cream, and butter size of walnut. Remove

Put white of 1 egg in a deep bowl, add 1 cup sugar and 1 cup 
red raspberries crushed and the juice drained off. Whip for 
about V2 hour. If beaten long enough, this filling will be stifC

late, 2 tablesp sugar and 1 tablesp boiling water. Remove from 
fire, flavor with vanilla, and spread on cake before icing is cold, 
using a broad-bladed knife dipped in cold water to smooth it. 
If the icing seems too thick, add a little more boiling water, 
but never use cold water. — [Miss U. R., la.

preferred flavoring. Beat with an egg beater until the mix- 
ture is white and begins to get firm. Before it gets too stiff, 
beat into it 1 pt of whipped cream. The cream should be 
whipped first, and the gelatine mixture should be added to it 
gradually. This filling will keep stiff indefinitely. Be careful 
not to use too much gelatine. — [Mrs. K. R. F., Tex. 




Ices, Ice Qreant and Qontections 

HAT is more delightfully cooling and refresh- 
ing than frozen fruit ices and ice cream ? And 
not only are they most palatable, but ice cream 
is nourishing as well, and of great value in the 
sick room. Pure, homemade candies also pos- 
sess dietetic value, and when partaken of spar- 
ingly and only occasionally, can do no harm, except perhaps 
to those whose state of health requires total abstinence from 
all sweets. The following directions and recipes will doubt- 
less answer all the needs of the family of average 
means, in that particular branch of the art of cookery. 

How to Freeze Ices and Creams 

Small freezers, for family use, can now be had at such 
reasonable prices, that almost nine out of every ten house- 
keepers can count a freezer among her necessary cooking uten- 
sils. On farms where milk, cream, eggs and fruit are plenti- 
ful, the chief item of expense, when making ice cream, is the 
ice — unless the farm can also boast of a well-filled ice-house — 
but even if not, 5c or 10c worth of ice will go a long way. 

Put the ice in a bag and crush fine by pounding with a 
•wooden mallet or the broad side of an axe — there should be 
no pieces larger than a walnut — the finer, the better. Use 
three parts coarse rock salt to one part crushed ice, 
evenly distributed and pack closely and solidly around the can 
in the freezer. The cream will freeze more quickly if more 
salt is used, but will not be so fine grained. Remember that 
freezing increases the bulk of the cream mixture, and there- 
fore never fill the can more than three-quarters full. The 
ice and salt need come up no further than the contents of can. 

Cover the can closely, adjust the top, and make sure that 
the can fits in the socket, so that the crank may be turned 
readily. Turn the crank slowly and steadily at first, after- 
wards more rapidly, until it becomes difficult to turn, which 
is the sign that freezing has been accomplished. More ice 
and salt may be added, from time to time, if necessary, but 
the water should not be drawn off before the freezing is 
done, unless it gets so high that it threatens to run over into 
the can. It is the salt water that does the freezing, and it is 
the salt that melts the ice, and the more salt, the quicker the 

;ii9 



120 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



freezing, although, as before mentioned, quick freezing 
produces a coarse grained cream. 

After the mixture is well frozen, draw the water off, care- 
fully remove cover and dasher, and pack the cream down 
solidly, then return the cover, closing the opening in same 
securely with a cork, and repack the freezer, using four parts 
crushed ice to one part salt. Cover with a piece of carpet or 
quilt, and let stand at least two or three hours to "ripen," 
before serving, although it may stand even longer. 

Lemon or Orange Ice 

For a lemon ice boil together 20 minutes 2 cups sugar with 
4 cups water, or until it syrups, then add % oup strained 
lemon juice, let get cold, and then freeze. Proceed the same 
for orange ice, only use less lemon — about ^, cup lemon juice 
' — and 2 cups orange juice, with the grated rind of 2 oranges. 

Strawberry, Raspberry and Currant Ices 

To 1^/4 cups sugar add 4 cups water and boil 20 minutes, or 
until it syrups, then add either 2 cups strawberry, raspberry 
or currant juice (a mixture of half raspberry and half currant 
Is nice), and in the case of strawberry or raspberry alone, 
add to the former 1 tablesp and to the latter 2 tablesp lemon 
juice. Let the mixture get cold, and then freeze. To obtain 
the pure fruit juice, mash, heat a little, but add no water, and 
squeeze through a cheese cloth bag. Strain again if the liquid 
does not look clear enough. 

Milk Sherbet 

Mix together 1% cups sugar and the juice of 3 lemons (if 
small or not very juicy, use 4 lemons) and then add, slowly 
and gradually, stirring constantly, 4 cups milk. If this is 
■carefully done, it will not curdle, but if it should happen 
to curdle, it will not spoil the sherbet, though it may not 
look so nice. Freeze. 

Peach Sherbet 

To 2 cups sugar add 1 qt water and about 10 peach kernels, 
and bcil 20 minutes, then add 1 teasp clear granulated gela- 
tine, soaked in 2 tablesp cold water, and stir until dissolved. 
Let get cold, and then add 1% cups mashed peach pulp (fully 
ripe peaches mashed through a sieve), and the juice of 1 
lemon and 2 oranges. Freeze. 

Coffee Sherbet 

To % or % cup finely ground coffee add 1 beaten egg and 
the crushed shell, then stir in % cup cold water, and when

well mixed, add 6 cups boiling water and let boil 2 or 3 min- 
utes, but no longer, then add 2 teasp clear granulated gela- 
tine soaked in 2 tablesp cold water, and stir till dissolved, then 
strain through cheese cloth wrung out of hot water. Add to 
the strained liquid 1^^ cups sugar, and when dissolved and 
cold, freeze. Serve in glass cups, each one topped off with a 
spoonful of whipped cream. 

Grape Sherbet 

To 1 pt sugar add 1 qt water and boil 20 minutes, then add 
1 teasp clear granulated gelatine soaked in 1 tablesp cold 
water, and when dissolved, remove from fire, add 1 pt clear 
grape juice, and the juice of 2 lemons. Cool and freeze. 

Pineapple Frappe 

To 1% cups sugar add 2 cups water and boil 15 minutes, 
then add juice of 3 lemons and a fresh pineapple, shredded 
(or canned pineapple, but in that case use less sugar in the 
syrup). Remove from fire and stir in 2 cups cold water, and 
when cold, freeze, using equal parts of ice and salt. Other 
juicy fruits or berries can be used the same way. 

Vanilla or Chocolate Ice Cream 

Mix well together 1 cup sugar, 1 tablesp flour and % teasp 
salt, then add 1 beaten egg, and very gradually 2 cups hot 
milk. Cook in a double boiler 20 minutes, stirring constantly, 
and when cold add 1 qt cream (thin), and 2 tablesp vanilla 
extract. The mixture should be nice and smooth, like custard, 
but should it happen to curdle, it will not show after freez- 
ing, nor affect the taste. Freeze. For chocolate ice cream 
use only 1 tablesp vanilla, and add 1 or l^/^ squares of bitter 
chocolate, or an equal quantity of cocoa. Ice creams should 
taste very sweet before freezing. For variety, when making 
vanilla ice cream, burn half the sugar (to make a caramel) 
and add it to the hot custard. Chopped nut meats added to 
vanilla ice cream is also nice. 

Coffee Ice Cream 

Scald together lYz cups milk and Vz cup freshly made, 
strong, black coffee, then gradually add this to 1 V4, cups sugar 
mixed with 2 beaten eggs and a pinch of salt, stirring vigor= 
ously, and cook in a double boiler until thickened, then add, 
slowly and gradually, 1 qt cream, stirring constantly, and let 
stand on back of range about 20 minutes. Cool and freeze. 



122 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Unboiled Foundation Cream 

Into a bowl put the white of 1 egg, V2 tablesp cold water, 
and % teasp vanilla, and beat until well mixed, then add 
gradually 1 lb confectioner's sugar (or a little less), until stlfE 
enough to handle or knead. This cream can be used in various 
ways. For creamed walnuts, break off small pieces, shape into 
small, fiat cakes, and press half a walnut on either side of 
each cake. For chocolate crear drops, shape into small balls, 
stick on end of knitting needl- or a toothpick, and dip in 
melted chocolate, to which no water has been added. For nut 
bars, work chopped nut meats into the cream, and cut in small 
bars. The cream can be flavored and colored to suit. 

Colorings for Candy 

Prepared cochineal is harmless and tasteless, used in small 
quantities, and produces all the pretty and varying shades from 
a light pink to a deep red. Buy 1 oz powdered cochineal at 
the drug store and boil it with 5 grains bi-carbonate of soda 
and ^A pt soft water until reduced one-half, then add 2 
drachms erch of powdered alum and cream of tartar, let boil 
10 minutes longer, and strain through double cheese cloth. 
Bottle and cork. From 5 to 10 drops is enough to color candy. 

A nice yellow color is obtained by using more or less of the 
grated rind of an orange, or the following preparation: Boil 
1 oz English hay-saffron in 1 pt water until reduced one-half, 
then strain, and bottle and cork. Be careful not to use too 
much of this coloring, or you may find the flavoring objec- 
tionable. 

Pretty amber or light brown colors can be obtained by using 
a few drops, more or less, of caramel, which is prepared as 
follows: Put % pt sugar in a granite-ware kettle over the 
fire, and stir constantly until it melts and begins to smoke and 
burn, then quickly add % pt water, and stir and boil until a 
thick syrup, the consistency of molasses. Bottle and cork. 
Will keep a year. 

Use spinach greens to obtain green shades. Boil down to a 
very small quantity, then strain and boil the juice again until 
it curdles, after which strain again and let the soft residue 
dry in the air until it forms a thick paste, then rub in an equal 
quantity of powdered sugar, and when smooth, put away in 
a covered glass jar. 

Peppermint Drops 

Stir until dissolved 1 % cups sugar and % cup boiling water, 
then boil 10 minutes, remove from fire, add 6 to 8 drops oil 
of peppermint, and beat until the right consistency to drop 
from tip of spoon on buttered paper. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 123 



Gum Drops or Wafers 

Soak 1 oz gum tragacanth (bought at drug store) in 1 cup 
cold water about 24 hours, and then rub through a fine wire 
sieve. Knead in enough confectioner's sugar so the mass can 
be handled, and add flavoring and coloring as preferred. Roll 
thin on a smooth board dredged with confectioner's sugar, cut 
in small squares or fancy shapes, and roll in granulated sugar. 

Plain Molasses Candy 

Put 3 tablesp butter in a small granite-ware kettle, place 
over fire, and when melted, add 2 cups molasses and % cup 
sugar, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Boil steadily until, 
when a little is dropped in cold water, the candy will become 
brittle. Stir constantly, to prevent burning and boiling over. 
Just before removing from the fire, add 1 tablesp vinegar, 
and pour the mixture on a well-buttered pie plate. When cool 
enough to handle, pull until the candy is porous and light 
colored, using the hands, well buttered, but be careful to 
handle the candy lightly, between fingers and thumbs. Squeez- 
ing between the hands would spoil it. Cut in small pieces with 
a sharp knife, and arrange on buttered plates to cool. 

Velvet Molasses Candy 

Put over the fire, in a granite-ware kettle, 1 cup molasses, 
3 cups sugar, 1 cup boiling water, and 3 tablesp vinegar. 
When it reaches the boiling point, add ^ teasp cream of 
tartar, and boil until, when a little is dropped in cold water, 
it will become brittle. Stir constantly, and when nearly done! 
add V2 cup melted butter and ^ teasp soda. Pour on a but- 
tered pie plate, and when cool enough to handle, pull, same as 
directed in recipe for plain molasses candy, working in, while 
pulling 1 teasp vanilla and V2 teasp lemon extract, or a few: 
drops of peppermint or oil of wintergreen. 

Sugar Candy 

Put 2 tablesp butter in a granite-ware kettle, and when 
melted add 2 cups sugar and % cup vinegar. Stir until sugar 
is dissolved, and boil until when a little of the mixture is drop- 
ped in cold water it will become brittle. Pour on a buttered 
pie plate, and pull, the same as molasses candy. 

Cream Candy 

Into an agate-ware kettle put 3 cups sugar, ^ cup boiling 
water, V2 tablesp vinegar, and 14 teasp cream of tartar. Stir 
until the sugar is dissolved, then boil without stirring until 
it will brittle when a little is dropped in cold water. Pour on 
a buttered plate, and as soon as it can be handled, pull until 



124 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



white and glossy, meanwhile working in any desired flavor — « 
lemon, orange or vanilla extract, or a few drops of oil of win- 
tergreen or sassafras, or peppermint. Cut In small pieces and 
lay on a buttered plate to cool. 

Old-Fashioned Butter Scotch 

Boil together until it will brittle, 1 cup sugar, % cup molas- 
ses, % cup butter, 2 tablesp boiling water, and 1 tablesp vine- 
gar, then pour on a buttered plate, and before it hardens, 
mark in squares with a knife. If liked, a little vanilla ex- 
tract or cinnamon may be added, after removing from fire. 

Plain Butter Taflfy 

Boil until it brittles, 2 cups brown sugar, % cup molasses, 
2 tablesp each vinegar and water, and % teasp salt. When 
nearly done add M: cup butter, and after removing from fire, 
2 teasp vanilla extract. Pour on a buttered plate, and before 
it hardens, mark in squares with a knife. 

Horehound Taffy 

Buy any desired quantity of pressed horehound at the drug 
store, cut off a piece about 1 inch square, and steep 1 minute 
in 2 cups boiling water, then strain through a double cheese 
cloth, add 3 cups sugar and % teasp cream of tartar, and boil 
until it will brittle, then pour on a buttered plate, and before it 
hardens, mark with a knife in small squares. 

Chocolate or Nut Caramels 

Put 21/^ tablesp butter in a kettle over the fire, and when 
melted add 2 cups molasses, 1 cup brown sugar, and V2 cup 
milk. Stir until sugar is dissolved, let come to the boiling 
point, then add 2 or 3 squares bitter chocolate, and stir until 
it is melted. Boil until, when a little is dropped in cold 
water, it can be shaped into a soft, firm ball, between the 
fingers, then remove from fire, add 1 teasp vanilla, pour on a 
buttered plate, and when cool, mark in inch squares with a 
sharp knife. To make nut caramels, add to the above 1 lb 
English walnuts, chopped fine, or y2 lb blanched almonds, 
chopped, or any other nut meats. 

Cocoanut Candy 

Put 2 teasp butter in a granite-ware saucepan, and when 
melted add 1^ cups sugar and 1 cup milk, and stir until sugar 
is dissolved. Boil 12 minutes after it begins to boil, then 
remove from fire and add V2 teasp vanilla and % cup grated 
or shredded cocoanut, and beat until creamy, then pour on a 
buttered plate, cool, and mark in squares with a sharp knife. 
Any nut meats may be used instead of cocoanut. 




Beverages and Syrups 

OLD water would suffice as a beverage for 
man, were he minded to so limit himself, 
and providing the water was pure, the cause 
of good health would certainly be better 
served by abstinence from some of the con- 
coctions and brews that have followed in 
the wake of civilization. However, this is not saying that 
water is the only healthful drink. When properly made, and 
not indulged in to excess, the beverages prepared according 
to the following recipes will be found to be not only harm- 
less, but pleasant, nutritious and refreshing — making all 
due allowances for those who, on account of some organic 
trouble or physical disability, have been cautioned by their 
physicians to abstain from certain drinks. 

Drinking Water 

It is of the utmost importance that water used for drinking 
and cooking should be absolutely pure. To be careless about 
this matter is to invite malaria, typhoid and many other dan- 
gerous diseases. If any doubt exists as to the purity of the 
water, which supplies your family, have it examined. Often 
this question of drinking water is the hinge on which the 
whole subject of health turns. Filters require great care and 
close attention to secure absolute cleanliness, by frequent 
changes of the filtering material, or they will only make a 
bad matter worse. The safest way is to boil water, when its 
purity is doubtful, and cool it in clean, tightly corked bottles. 
Boiling destroys disease germs. 

The well or source of water supply should on no account 
be situated anywhere near to barn, stable, cesspools, manure 
heaps, earth closets, or any other possible means of contam- 
ination, since the fluid from these filters through the earth 
and is often carried considerable distances, finally joining 
veins or springs of water that flow to the well. Look into 
this water question most carefully, and spare neither trouble 
nor expense to make it right. Remember, there is no health- 
ful substitute for pure water — nature's provision for one of 
man's chief needs.

Milk and Its Care 

Milk, though classed as a beverage, is in reality a food. 
However, milk alone, as a food, would not sufiQce for the 
average adult, who requires well-balanced food, in which the 
liquid does not exceed the other needful food elements, but 
when milk is taken with a meal, less other food is required. 
Raw milk should be sipped very slowly, and if a very little 
lime or barley water is added, it can be retained and digested 
by the most delicate stomach. 

The question of cleanliness in the handling and storing of 
milk is as important in its relation to health as is the water 
question. Milking should be done under the strictest sanitary 
conditions. Negligence in this respect is positively criminal. 
That lawmakers have been obliged to force this issue is not 
creditable to farmers and dairymen, for in these days of 
enlightenment and free information and scientific researches, 
they cannot even plead ignorance as an excuse. Many a child 
has gone to an untimely grave because of some one's lack of 
conscience in this matter. However, it is not always the 
dairyman who is responsible — often the housewife or mother 
is to blame, for though the milk may come to her hands pure, 
her negligence may cause the greatest mischief. 

Milk is one of the best soils for the growth and multiplica- 
tion of certain disease germs — hence the great need of cleanli- 
ness, from the time it is yielded by a healthy cow, until it is 
consumed. It would take a full chapter to do justice to this 
question of the sanitary care and handling of milk, but any- 
one who is not an idiot can figure it out for himself and there- 
fore, no more need to be said about it here. One more caution 
— remember that milk readily absorbs odors and flavors, so 
be sure to always keep it tightly sealed, 

Konmiss 

Koumiss is frequently ordered by physicians for patients 
who are convalescent an who require an easily digested and 
nutritious tonic. It is prepared as follows: Heat pure, fresh 
milk to about 100 degrees, then add to each qt l*/^ tablesp 
sugar, 1 tablesp fresh, lively yeast or a liberal ^ cake of 
fresh compressed yeast, dissolved in 1 tablesp lukewarm 
water, stir until thoroughly mixed, and then put in pint bottles 
to within about 2 Inches of the top, and cork tightly and tie 
the corks down securely. Let stand from 10 to 12 hours in a 
temperature of about 60 to 70 degrees, after which it will be 
ready for drinking. Keep in a cool place and chill before 
using. The average dose for an adult is 1 glass, three times 
a day. Do not prepare too much koumiss at once, as it is 
not good when it gets old. One qt milk, with the other 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 127 



ingredients, will be about enough for 3 pt bottles, and more 
than that should not be prepared at one time for only one 
patient. — [A. G., Mass. 

Egg-Nogg 

Beat the yolks of 3 eggs and 2 or 3 tablesp powdered sugar 
to a cream, add the beaten whites and a little grated nutmeg, 
% cup cream, stirring well, and gradually 1 pt fresh milk. 
Vanilla flavor may be used instead of nutmeg, if liked. Serve 
very cold. — [A. G., Mass. 

Tea 

The water for tea should be drawn fresh and brought to a 
quick boil and used immediately. Stale water that has lost 
3ts sparkle, or water that has been standing in the kettle will 
not make good tea. Of course, teapot and kettle should be 
kept scrupulously clean. Rinse the teapot (china or earthen- 
ware), with boiling water, put in 1 teasp tea for each cup 
or person to be served, pour on the boiling water (water 
must be boiling furiously), cover the teapot closely, and set 
on back of range to steep from 3 to 5 minutes, but no longer, 
and serve at once. Over-steeped tea is not healthful, and even 
dangerous, while properly prepared tea is harmless and mildly 
stimulating. If too strong, add hot water to each cup when 
pouring, and if not strong enough, use more tea. Serve 
with unboiled cream. If a good tea leaf was used, and these 
directions are faithfully followed, a delicious and refreshing 
brew will be the result. Always keep the dry tea in a closed 
canister and never allow left-over tea to remain in teapot. 
For iced tea, pour the freshly made tea from the leaves into 
a pitcher and let cool, after which add ice and serve as soon 
as chilled.— [Mrs. J. C, N. Y. 

Coffee 

There are three methods of preparing coffee — one by filter- 
ing, the other by boiling, and the other by the careless process 
which produces a muddy and ill-flavored concoction which is 
as harmful as it is unpalatable. In the first place, the water 
should be freshly boiled (see directions for tea), and the 
coffee pot must be immaculately clean — of china, earthen or 
graniteware. Never allow left-over coffee to stand in the 
coffee pot, and scald the latter about once a week, adding 
a little soda to the water. The coffee pot should be rinsed 
with boiling water, and the fresh water for the coffee be boil- 
ing furiously. If a filtered coffee is desired, use a regular 
filterer or a homemade one, consisting of a round cheesecloth 



128 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



bag with a wire run through the hem at the top, the circle 
a little wider than the top of the coffee pot, so that vrhen the 
bag is suspended in the pot, the edge of the bag may turn 
over the edge of the pot, and permit the cover to be put 
on, and put 1 tablesp finely-ground coffee for each cup or 
person to be served into the filterer, and pour over the freshly 
boiling water. Keep the coffee pot standing in another pot 
of boiling water, to keep hot. The filtered coffee may be 
turned over the grounds in the filterer for a second time, to 
extract all the strength, and the coffee should then be served 
at once, with rich, boiling hot milk, or thick, sweet uncooked 
cream. 

The coffee for filtering should always be ground very fine, 
but for boiled coffee, it should be ground coarse. For the 
latter put the coffee right into the pot, pour over the boiling 
water, cover closely, let boil up 1 minute, then move to back 
of stove and let draw 5 minutes, but no longer, pour off 
carefully through a fine sieve into another hot coffee pot, 
and serve at once. If properly prepared, the coffee will not 
be muddy and no egg nor shells will be required to "settle'* 
it. The "settling," if necessary, is accomplished just as well 
with a dash of cold water. A good quality coffee, well roasted, 
is essential to good results. Do not grind a lot of coffee at 
once, and keep the beans in a tightly covered canister, so that 
they may not take on any other flavors, and that none of 
the aroma escapes. If the beans are in the slightest degree 
damp, they will be hard to grind. They can be made fresh 
and crisp by placing in a hot oven a few minutes, and cooling 
quickly. — [Mrs. J. C. N. Y. 

Cereal Coffee 

The directions which are printed on the package in which 
cereal coffee is bought should be carefully followed, and the 
same rules for tea and coffee, regarding fresh water and clean 
pots, are applicable here too. Cereal coffee requires long 
cooking, and when properly prepared is not only harmless, 
but delicious, nutritious and easily digested. — [A. G., Mass. 

Homemade Cereal Coffee 

To 1 qt wheat bran add 1 pt corn meal, V2 cup molasses, 
and 1 egg. Mix well together, then spread in a pie pan about 
V2 inch thick, and brown slowly and evenly in the oven. 
Watch carefully, as it burns easily, and if burned it would spoil 
the flavor. Some people like to add a very little butter or 
salt to the mixture. When browned and dry, store in covered 
tin cans. To make coffee use 1 cup of this cereal mixture for 
1 qt coffee, and let boil 1 hour or more — it requires long 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 129 



boiling to bring out the flavor. If desired, 1 tablesp grounS 
coffee may be added during the last 5 minutes of boiling. Serve 
with cream and sugar. — [Mrs. V. R. L., Pa. 

Cocoa and Cocoa Shells 

Use half and half scalded milk and boiling water in a 
double boiler, allow 1 level teasp each of cocoa powder and 
sugar for each cup of liquid, mix these well in a cup, fill gradu- 
ally with the boiling mixture, stirring to free from lumps, and 
then turn into the rest of the milk, boil 5 minutes, and serve 
at once, with or without extra thick, sweet cream. First 
boiling the cocoa in the water and then adding the scalded 
milk is an improvement. Cocoa shells or "nibs" are cheap 
and make a delicious drink. Be sure they are fresh. Allow 
V2 cup cocoa shells or more to 1 qt boiling water and boil 
gently at least 3 hours, then strain and serve hot with cream 
and sugar. A little vanilla flavor added to cocoa or cocoa 
shell "tea," after removing from fire, is liked by come. — [A. 
V. N., N. Y. 

Chocolate 

Allow 2 ozs bitter chocolate for 1 qt boiling water and 
scalded milk — half and half — and 4 level tablesp sugar. 
Melt the chocolate and sugar in a very little hot water, stir 
smooth, then gradually add the rest of the boiling water and 
boil 5 minutes, after which add the scalded milk and boil 
from 3 to 5 minutes longer, stirring to prevent boiling over 
and a skin from forming on the top. — [A. V. M., N. Y. 

Quick Lemonade 

Melt 1 lb sugar with enough water to prevent burning, and

[Mrs. L. S., Minn. 

To Keep Cider 

Make the cider of nice, sound apples, and while still fresh, 
strain, and heat, skimming the scum as it rises, but do not 
boil. Pill the hot cider into glass fruit jars, and seal air 
tight. This will come in handy in summer time for the harvest 
hands. — [No Name. 

Canned Grape Juice

water and cook as for jelly. When soft, strain through a jelly 
bag, but do not squeeze the bag, as this would cloud the 
liquid. To each pt strained juice add 1 cup sugar, boil 2 or 3 
minutes, skim, bottle, cork, and seal while hot. When wanted 
for use, mix with an equal amount of water. The sugar may 
be omitted, if desired — many dyspeptics are ordered to drink 
unsweetened grape juice. Must be sealed in air-tight jars. — ^ 
[K. A. D., N. D. 

Syrups 

Use only the best sugar and soft, filtered water, if possible, 
as this will save the trouble of clarification, which is necessary 
when inferior ingredients are used. Pour the water cold over 
the sugar, and let it slowly melt. Boil by gentle heat, and 
then keep simmering until it syrups. Buy the essence and 
tincture from a reliable druggist. 

To make plain syrup, add to 6 lbs sugar 14 gal water. Boil 
until thoroughly dissolved and syrupy, and then filter. 

To make clove syrup add to 1 lb plain syrup 30 drops 
quintessence of cloves. Bottle and shake well before using.

lined kettle, bring to boiling point, add rose petals, cover, 
take from fire, and stand away over night. Next morning 
strain through a fine cloth, add the sugar, and boil until 
sugar is entirely dissolved and "syrupy." Fill into clean 
bottles, press in good, clean corks that have been soaking in 
boiling water, to which a pinch of baking soda was added, and 
dip the tops of bottles (cork and all) into melted wax or paraf- 
fine. Keep in a cool place. Fine rose flavor for cakes, ice 
creams, ices, icing, drinks, candies, etc. — [A. G., Mass. 

Imitation Maple Syrup 

Boil 1 doz clean corn cobs (red are best), from 1 to 2 hours, 
tn enough water to leave nearly 1 pt liquid, when done, then

desired. This syrup has a fine flavor, very much like maple 
syrup. — [Mrs. J. L. R., O. 

Silver Drip Syrup 

To 3 cups sugar add 1 cup water and % teasp purifier, and 
boil 15 minutes, then skim or strain. Nice to ser\e with warm 
cakes. The purifier is made as follows: Mix and sift together 
three times 1 teasp each flour, sugar, and powdered alum. This 
mixture can be kept on hand and used as needed. — [Mrs. C. 
H. Y., Mo. 

Soda Syrup 

To 2 lbs sugar add 2 ozs tartaric acid and 1^^ qts boiling 
water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, and let cool, then

water, and stir in scant i/4 teasp soda. — [Mrs. E. T., Vt. 

Cherry Syrup 

Boil ripe cherries with a very little water, and when soft, 
strain through a jelly bag. For each qt juice allow 3 lbs sugar. 
Put the sugar on with freshly boiled water, allowing 1 pt 
water for every 3 lbs sugar. Stir until dissolved, then add 
the cherry juice, bring to a boil, skim, and boil rapidly for 
1 or 2 minutes. Bottle, cork and seal. This syrup is delicious 
with hot cakes, or for flavoring puddings, sauces, ice cream, 
etc. — [Mrs. O. M, P., N. H. 

Toast Water 

Cut slices of stale bread V4, inch thick, put in slow oven 
to crisp, and w^hen a golden brown, break in pieces, add an 
equal amount boiling water, let stand 1 hour, then strain, 
and serve hot or cold with or without sugar. — [J. H. 



Doughnuts, Griddle Qakes and Fritters 

HERE are all kinds of doughnuts — good, 
bad, and indifferent. When they are not as 
good as they should be, it rests with the 
cook, who has probably failed to inform 
herself on all the fine points of doughnut 
manufacture. The following hints may 
be found useful in following the various reci- 
pes presented herewith. The dough should be as soft as 
possible, and not handled any more than is absolutely neces- 
sary. If too much baking powder is used the doughnuts 
will soak up fat, and if the dough is too stiff the fried cakes 
will be tough. Since they are fried in grease it is not 
advisable to use much shortening in the doughnuts. Equal 
parts of clarified lard and suet are the best to fry them 
in. The kettle should not be too small and there should 
be plenty of the fat, which should be hot. To keep the fat 
clear and to keep it from over-heating, some cooks drop in 
a piece of raw potato. It is well to test with a sample 
doughnut, to see if the dough is of the right consistency 
and the fat at the proper degree of heat. When the 
doughnut is dropped into the fat it should come to the top 
almost immediately, and when it is brown on one side it 
should be turned to brown on the other side. When the 
doughnuts are lifted from the fat they should be laid out 
on brown paper, to absorb the superfluous fat. It is best 
not to fry more than five or six doughnuts at a time, as drop- 
ping in too many fresh doughnuts would cool the fat 
too rapidly. A little practice and careful following of 
directions should result in a product that is both whole- 
some and palatable.

berry sauce as a side dish, they are most delicious, but when 
allowed to cool, they become heavy and soggy. — [A. G., Mass,

Qookies, Qraekers, and Small Qakes 

O keep the cookie jar replenished keeps 
many a mother and housewife busy and 
often necessitates a baking every week, for 
not only the young folks but "children of an 
older growth" frequently manifest their 
fondness for these wholesome little dainties 
by surreptitious inroads on the reserve supply, much to the 
dismay of the indulgent cook, who, however, apparently 
ignores these small depredations and wisely looks upon 
them as a tribute to her skill. Every one has his or her 
favorite cookie, but a little variety is generally welcomed 
by all. If you find among the following recipes any that 
are new to you, but "sound good," why not try them? A 
change will vary the monotony for the cook and provide a 
delightful surprise for the family.

flour a chance to swell, as the hot water takes the place of eggs. 
Use no more flour than necessary to form a soft dough for 
rolling out. These are excellent and economical cookies, and 
the only trick is to use as little flour as possible. — [Mrs. B. G., 
Mich.

Biseaits, Muffins and Dumplings 



"L&J" 




EAVY biscuits, made by newly-wed wives, 
have served as capital for the joke-makers 
for many years, but the following recipes 
are all so plain and the directions so easy 
to follow, that with their aid even the inex- 
perienced, amateur home-baker ought to be 
able to turn out creditable results in the line of biscuits, 
muffins, gems, dumplings, etc. As will be noted, soft 
doughs, little handling and quick baking are the three 
essentials to success in this department of cookery. It 
goes without saying that only the best obtainable ingredi- 
ents should be used, as no good results can reasonably be 
expected from inferior qualities of flour, baking powder, 
spices, etc. There is no lack of variety among the follow- 
ing recipes. Try some of them. 

Baking Powder Biscuits I 

To 1 qt sifted flour add 3 heaping teasp baking powdex% 1 
level teasp salt, 1 tablesp each of lard and butter, and milk 
enough to make a soft dough. Mould quickly, handle as little 
as possible, and bake in a quick oven. — [Mrs. W. A. M., N. Y.

Egg Dumplings 

About 1 hour before you want tlie dumplings ready to 
serve, beat up 4 eggs until light and add to them V2 pt hot 
soup broth and flavor with nutmeg, salt, and a little finely 
chopped parsley. Pour into a v/ell buttered vessel and stand 
this into another vessel filled with boiling water. Allow the

a pinch of salt, and a little nutmeg. Drop by the tablespoonful 
into salted, boiling water, and cook about 5 minutes, with 
the kettle uncovered. These are very good to serve with 
roast meat and gravy. It is a good plan to first boil one dump- 
ling and experiment with it, to see if the seasoning is just 
right, or if there is enough flour to hold them together. — [N.

Baking powder makes just as nice biscuits with sour milk as 
with sweet, in fact I think the sour milk and baking powder 
biscuits are usually more tender. — [Mrs. J. E. W., Kan. 

Instead of working the shortening into the biscuit dough, I 
have found this to be a quicker way: Before putting the bis- 
cuits in the oven make a dent in each with a knife, and put a 
little piece of butter in each. — [Mrs. A. P. H., N. Y. 




Bread, Rolls, Buns and Toast 

"Back of the loaf is the snowy flour, 

And back of the flour, the mill. 
Back of the mill is the wheat and the shower 

And the sun, and the Father's will." 

N the culinary line there is nothing- more 
important than to know how to prepare and 
bake good, wholesome bread — "the staff of 
life." The dry, tasteless composition mis- 
called bread by some anxious-to-get-rich- 
quick professional bakers, and by don't-know- 
how housewives, is calculated to make one place undue 
emphasis on the old saying that ''man cannot live on bread 
alone." As a matter of fact, such stuff is not only 
unpalatable, but also lacks the nutritive elements bread ought 
to have, being made of poor flour and deprived of what- 
ever little good there may have been in the flour by 
ignorant or careless handling and baking. And yet, really 
good, wholesome, nutritious and palatable bread is not 
expensive nor difficult to make. On the contrary, the art 
can be easily learned by any one who is willing and anxious 
to learn, be she a wholly inexperienced beginner or a dis- 
couraged amateur, desirous of improving. That our farm 
cooks know how to bake bread is fully attested by the fol- 
lowing delightful variety of recipes: 

The Ingredients of Bread 

Four of the simplest ingredients in the culinary laboratory 
enter into the composition of a loaf of bread; yet the changes 
through which these materials pass before a finished loaf is 
evolved are the most complicated in all cookery. The four 
ingredients that enter into a loaf of bread are flour, yeast, 
salt and liquid. Milk or water, or a part of each, may com- 
prise the latter. Bread made with milk is more nutritious, 
but it dries more quickly than does bread in which water is 
used. The texture of milk bread, even with slight kneading, 
is velvelty and pleasing. Half milk and half water is quite 
generally used. Water bread, without shortening, carefully 

165 



166 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



manipulated, gives a loaf of nutty flavor, but with tough crust. 
"Water, with two tablespoons shortening to the pint, is more 
generally preferred by American housekeepers. Opinions 
differ as to just what properties good bread should possess. 
Some wish a moist crumb and tender crust, others a dry crumb 
and a flinty crust. But there are certain points upon which 
all agree; namely, bread should be agreeable in smell and 
taste, while it should be light and porous, and the loaf should 
keep in good condition several days. — [J. McK. H. 

About the Flour 

The prime requisite for good bread is good flour. Without 
good flour the best cook cannot possibly make good bread. 
Obviously, it is poor economy to buy the poorer grades of 
flour, and if your local dealer cannot or will not furnish you 
with the best, send an order to the nearest town or city, and 
insist upon getting the right kind. Flour made from inferior 
wheat or wheat that has been exposed to moisture produces a 
heavy, moist bread, which moulds quickly. 

To test bread flour, according to Mrs. Rorer, make a small 
ball of dough from flour and water, knead well, as for bread, 
and then quickly break the ball or biscuit in half. It should- 
break with a crack, but if it is poor flour it will first pull and! 
stretch and finally break without a sound. Another test is toj 
take a handful of flour, close the hand tightly, then open it,i 
and if the flour falls apart and does not pack, it is good forj 
bread or biscuits. The color should be a rich, creamy tint — ■■' 
blue-white or greyish tints indicate poor, cheap flour. 

Pastry flour should never be used for bread, biscuits or| 
mufiins, but only for fine pastry, cakes and similar light mix- 
tures that do not require kneading. Genuine pastry flour is 
a pale, yellowish white, fine and starchy, and will easily retain 
the form of the hand upon pressure. It is usually sold in smalli 
boxes or bags, but very seldom, if ever, in bulk, to retailers.j 
The only permissible substitute for genuine pastry flour, when 
that cannot be obtained, is a soft, winter-wheat flour. 

Whole wheat flour is of a dark, brown color, rather coarse, 
and should be free from bran, which is the outside coat of the 
wheat. All the other nutritive parts of the wheat grain are 
retained in the whole wheat flour, while only the inner por-^ 
tions are used for the fine white flour, which lacks many of, 
the more nutritious elements. Bread made from whole wheat 
flour is considered by physicians to be the best diet for young! 
and old — especially those suffering from weak digestion, for, 
nursing mothers and for those inclined to be anaemic, espe-| 
cially children inclined to rickets, and those whose teeth showj 
signs of early decay, as whole wheat is rich in alkaline phos-j 
phates. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 167 

Again, according to Mrs. Rorer, most graham flour sold in 
«kur markets is composed of a little white flour and a goodly 
quantity of bran, mixed with a certain proportion of "shorts" 
or "middlings." These particles being indestructible, graham 
bread therefore cannot be recommended very highly for steady 
consumption. 

Experienced housewives know that flour varies in its 
capacity to absorb moisture, and that therefore no recipe can 
indicate exactly the necessary amount of flour to be used. A 
little practice, perseverance and common sense will soon teach 
ambitious beginners the methods which will produce best 
results. 

About Kneading Bread Dongh 

Stir sufficient flour into the sponge to make a dough that 
may be turned on to a board sprinkled with flour; then flour 
the hands. Draw the dough farthest from you over into the 
center several times, and then turn the whole mass half 
around. Draw it again from the opposite side toward the 
center; and press it down either with the fingers or the ball 
of the hand, then half turn again, and repeat this, with a sort 
of rocking motion, until the dough has been thoroughly and 
evenly kneaded. This will take at least 15 minutes. At first 
you must add flour, just a little at a time; but after the dough 
has lost its stickiness, knead it on a dry board. When it 
ceases to stick on pressure, the kneading may be discontinued. 
— [Mrs. S. T. Rorer. 

When the bread dough becomes elastic and loses its stick- 
iness, it has been kneaded sufficiently long and is ready for its 
first raising. Kneading is really the most important part of 
bread making. In most households, the hands are used for 
this purpose. Good and inexpensive bread mixers can now 
be had which save three-quarters of the labor in bread mak- 
ing. — [A, G., Mass. 

Good Bread Without Kneading 

I find that the chief secret of good bread is mixing the dough 
softe Use any favorite bread recipe, but use more wetting. 
Mix it so soft that you can easily beat it with a strong spoon — 
so soft that you cannot handle the dough except with well 
floured hands, and so soft that you cannot shape it into round 
loaves. I mix bread in a large granite-ware pail, cover with a 
tin cover, and wrap the whole thing snugly in an old com- 
forter, set it on top of a high stool, which in turn I place upon 
the top of a chair, and put all in a warm corner of the room. 
This arrangement keeps the draughts off, and as the upper lay- 
ers of air in the room are the warmest it secures for the bread 
a uniform degree of v/armth throughout the whole process of 
fermentation. This is not always easy to get, particularly in 



168 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



winter. In the morning I turn the dough into nicely buttered 
bread tins, smear the top with melted butter, and let stand 
until it is double in bulk. Have the oven pretty hot for the first 
20 or 30 minutes, and then reduce the heat somewhat. This 
gives a deliciously crisp crust. — [Mrs. W. J. T., Vt. 

About the Baking 

The baking of the bread is of the greatest importance, as the 
yeast plant must during the baking process be thoroughly 
killed. Otherwise it is capable of setting up fermentation in 
the stomach. If the oven is too hot and the loaves large, the 
crust surrounding will prevent the heat from penetrating to 
the center of the loaf. Such bread is very unwholesome. There 
are several ways of testing the oven without a thermometer. 
The old-fashioned baker's method was to throw flour on the 
floor of the oven and if it browned up after 3 minutes without 
taking fire, the oven was sufficiently heated. The ordinary 
cook will hold her hand in the oven while she slowly counts 
twenty. If you have an indicator on your oven, the hand 
should register 8. When the bread is done, it should immedi- 
ately be removed from the pans and tipped up so that the air 
may circulate freely around each loaf. Do not cover the 
bread even with a light cloth, as in this way the moisture is 
held, destroying the crispness of the crust, and making the 
center rather heavy. — [Mrs. S. T. R. 

To Make Yeast Without Yeast 

On Monday morning boil 2 ozs hops in 4 qts water % hour, 
strain, and when the liquor is lukewarm add a small handful 
salt and V2 lb brown sugar. Mix V2 lb flour to a smooth paste 
with some of the liquor and then mix all well together and let 
stand till Wednesday, then add 3 lbs raw potatoes, grated, 
mix well and let stand till Thursday. It should be stirred 
frequently and stand in a warm place. When baking bread 
you will find that it will not require more than Vz of this 
yeast as compared to other yeast. — [Mrs. N. E. W., Mo. 

Fresh Yeast 

To 4 large tablesp hot mashed potatoes add ^/^ teasp salt, 
1 teasp sugar, and hot water enough to make a thin batter. 
When lukewarm, add 1 cake compressed yeast, thoroughly dis- 
solved in a little lukewarm water. Stir well and set in a warm 
place to rise over night. I always make yeast fresh the day 
before I bake bread. This insures sweet, delicious bread, with 
no sour taste. — [L. M., N. Y. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 169^ 



Perpetual Yeast 

Dissolve 1 cake compressed yeast in 1 pt lukewarm unsalted 
water in which potatoes were boiled. Mix well, add % cup 
sugar, stir thoroughly, pour into a 2-Qt glass jar, cover loosely, 
a,nd then let stand in a warm place over night. Next morning 
it will be a foaming mass. Put the rubber on the can, screw 
the cover down tight and set away in a cool place. When 
ready to make bread, pour into the can of yeast foam prepared 
as above, 1 pt lukewarm water in which potatoes were cooked, 
mix well, and then stir in i^ cup sugar. Let the can stand 
open in a warm place about 5 hours, or until the contents are 
very light and foamy. Then stir it down and use 1 pt of the 
mixture for raising four loaves of bread. Put the rubber and 
cover on the jar again and keep in a cool place. Some of this 
yeast may be used once or twice a week, or every night, by 
adding fresh potato water and sugar as described above. — 
[Mrs. C. E. A., N. H. 

Potato Yeast 

To 1 qt hot, unsalted, mashed potatoes, add 1 qt hot un- 
salted water in which the potatoes were boiled, and a paste 
made of 3 tablesp flour and a little cold water. Beat well, and 
then add 3 tablesp sugar, 2 tablesp salt and 1 pt cold water. 
When this mixture is lukewarm, add 1 cake compressed yeast, 
thoroughly dissolved in a little lukewarm water. Let stand 
in a warm place until light, and when light, use as much of 
this yeast as you have water — 1 qt yeast and 1 qt water with 
flour enough to knead to the proper consistency will make 
about five or six loaves of bread. — [Mrs. J. B., Kan. 

Raw Potato Yeast 

Peel and grate 5 medium sized raw potatoes, put in a gal 
crock and add V2 cup each salt and sugar, and stir it well, 
then pour in boiling water, stirring constantly until the mix- 
ture thickens. Stir or beat with a spoon occasionally while 
allowing it to cool, and when lukewarm add % pt old yeast 
or % cake compressed yeast dissolved in a little lukewarm 
water. Set away in a warm place until light. — [Mrs. D. L. A., 
Ore. 

Hop and Raw Potato Yeast 

Boil a handful of hops in 1 qt water, then strain, pour the 
liquid in a jar and add to it 1 cup sugar, % cup salt, 1 level 
tablesp ginger and 8 medium sized raw potatoes, grated. Mix 
well, and when lukewarm, add 2 cakes compressed yeast, thor- 
oughly dissolved in a little lukewarm water. Cover and let 



170 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

stand in a warm place till light, then seal and keep in a cool 
place. One cup of this will be plenty for three loaves of bread. 
Shake the jar well before using this yeast.— [Mrs. B. B. G., 
Mass. 

Buttermilk Yeast Cakes 

Scald 1 qt fresh buttermilk but do not let it boil, and while 
it is scalding hot sift in about 1 V2 qts white corn meal mixed 
with 1 teasp salt. Stir vigorously, and when the mixture is 
lukewarm stir in 1 cake compressed yeast, dissolved in a little 
lukewarm water. Set away in a warm place to rise, and when 
the mixture has become very light, stir it down again. Do 
this three times and then add more corn meal and flour suffi- 
cient to make the mass stiff enough so it will stick together and 
can be easily handled. Form into small cakes and let them 
dry.— [L. M., N. Y. 

Tanzy Yeast 

Boil together in 1 pt water, 1 large potato, and about 10 
tanzy leaves. When the potato is soft, skim out the tanzy 
leaves, mash the potato fine and when lukewarm stir in 2 
tablesp flour and 1 cake compressed yeast, dissolved in a lit- 
tle lukewarm water, 1 tablesp sugar and 1 teasp salt. Set 
away in a warm place until light and foamy, then stir in about 
IVz pts white corn meal. It should be quite stiff. Roll out on 
a well floured board, about 1/2 inch thick, cut in 1-inch 
squares, and dry. Store in sealed paper bags and hang in a 
cool place. Use one of these cakes for three loaves of bread.— 
[Mrs. M. McC, Kan. 

Jug Yeast 

"Wash and peel 6 medium sized potatoes, cut into quarters 
and boil until soft. While the potatoes are cooking, steep a 
handful of hops in 1 pt water. When the potatoes are well 
done, mash them fine, sift over them 1 pt flour, add % pt 
sugar and scant i^ pt salt. Mix well and then pour over this 
the hot water in which the potatoes were cooked and the 
strained water in which the hops were steeped, and beat all 
well together until smooth. Then add enough water to make 
I gal in all. When lukewarm add 2 cakes compressed yeast, 
thoroughly dissolved in a little lukewarm water. Stir well and 
set away in a warm place until it ferments and is light, then 
pour in a jug, cork tightly, and keep in cool place. Use about 
V2 pt of this yeast for a baking of bread.— [Mrs. H. C. H., 
Col. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 171 



Homemade Baking Powder 

To 1 lb and 2 ozs cream tartar add ^^ lb bi-carbonate of 
soda and % lb fine cornstarch. Mix well and sift through 
a very fine sieve at least six times to be sure that the ingredi- 
ents are evenly distributed. All the ingredients must be dry, 
and the baking powder should be kept in a close tin, and set 
away in a dry place. Weigh the ingredients exactly, accord- 
ing to the above given quantities. Too much soda will cause 
yellow or brown spots to appear in the batters where this bak- 
ing powder is used, and besides being unpalatable, when too 
much soda is used it hinders digestion. — [A. G., Mass. 

White Bread 

At noon, when the potatoes are cooked for dinner, select 
3 about the size of an egg, mash very fine, add 1 level tablesp 
salt, 2 of sugar and 3 of flour. Mix all well together, then 
add scant % cup boiling water, stirring vigorously, and when 
lukewarm add % cake compressed yeast dissolved in a little 
lukewarm water. Stir the mixture well, cover and let stand 
in a warm place. In the evening scald 2 cups sweet milk, 
pour it into the mixing pan, add 2 cups cold water, and when 
lukewarm add the light yeast mixture, and mix stiff with warm 
flour. Turn out on the bread board and mould into a large 
loaf, kneading about 10 or 15 minutes; then return to the mix- 
ing bowl, cover, and set in a warm place over night. In the 
morning knead it down and divide into three loaves. Put into 
greased tins, and set in a warm place to rise until they have 
doubled in bulk. Bake one hour in a moderately hot oven. — 
[Mrs. B. G., N. Y. 

Yeast Bread (Compressed Yeast) 

At noon pour 1 qt water from the boiled potatoes over 1 
cup granulated sugar and let stand till lukewarm, then add 1 
compressed yeast cake, stir well, cover, and set in a warm place 
until next morning. Put 2 qts warm sifted bread flour in the 
mixing pan, make a hole in the middle, put in V2 cup sugar, a 
little salt, and a small piece of lard, then add 1 pt yeast as 
prepared above, and 1 qt lukewarm water. Stir well, cover 
and set in a warm place to rise. When light and foamy, mix 
stiff, adding more flour if necessary, and knead from 5 to 15 
minutes or longer. Let rise again, and when light shape into 
small loaves, but do not add any more flour. Place in dripping 
pans so the loaves just touch, brush with melted lard, and set 
to rise in a warm place. When light, but not too light (it 
should be no more than double in bulk), bake in a hot oven 
about 50 minutes. When done, take out, brush over with 
melted butter, cover with a light clean cloth and let cool. 
Keep the balance of the prepared yeast in a jar in a cool place« 



172 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



and the next time, the day before you wish to bake, start the 
yeast as before, only use the remaining prepared yeast, instead 
of the compressed. — [Mrs. E. McC, N. Y. 

White Bread (Perpetual Yeast) 

For four loaves bread use 3 qts flour, 1 scant qt lukewarm 
water, 1 tablesp salt and 1 pt perpetual yeast. (See perpetual 
yeast recipe.) Knead the dough until thoroughly mixed, rub 
the outside of the mass with a tablesp lard, or lard and butter, 
put in a bowl, cover, and set in a warm place to rise over night. 
Next morning mould into loaves, let stand in a warm place 1 
hour, and when light bake 1 hour in a hot oven. — [Mrs. C. B. 
A., N. H. 

Potato Yeast Bread 

Sift 3 qts warm flour in a warm mixing bowl with 1 tablesp 
salt, % tablesp sugar and Vz tablesp lard, then add 1 pt potato 
yeast, and 3 pts lukewarm water. Knead thoroughly, set in a 
warm place, and let rise over night. Next morning mould into 
loaves, set in a warm place until it has doubled in bulk, and 
then bake. — [Mrs. D. L. A., Ore. 

Hop Yeast Bread 

After tea time make a thin sponge with warm flour, 3 pts 
warm water and 1 cup hop yeast. Cover and let stand 2 hours 
in a warm place until light; then knead into a loaf, cover, and 
let stand in a warm place over night. In the morning mould 
into three loaves, let rise, and when light bake 1 hour. Have the 
oven quite hot when the loaves are first put in, and gradually 
moderate the heat. — [M. D., O. 

About "Salt Rising" or "Emptyings" 

This sponge or leavening is made by fermenting flour and 
water or milk without the addition of ordinary yeast. The true 
conditions of this fermentation are not exactly known. Judg- 
ing from the odor produced, bacteria play an important part 
in the "fermentation." Then, too, the wild yeast plants of the 
air find this an exceedingly good resting place, and grow with 
great rapidity. Whether or not this bread is wholesome, is an 
open question. We know this, that in a perfectly clean room 
(and by this we mean a room surgically clean, one free as nearly 
as possible from all germ contaminations) it is almost impossi- 
ble to make good "emptyings." Carry the basin from this room 
to one where the floor is covered with carpet, especially if the 
carpet has not been carefully cleaned or shaken recently, and 
almost immediately you will have a pitcher full of foaming 
''emptyings." We fully realize that many persons have eaten 
bread made after this method for years, and are, perhaps, in 
fairly good health. The question is, then, what would they have 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 173 

been if, instead, they had always used good bread? The effect 
of heat upon bread greatly influences its digestibility. "Salt 
rising" bread will not bake as easily or quickly as that made 
with yeast. The crust is always light and soft, and the crumb 
moist; seeming to hold much more water than other breads. 
This sponge, made from the wild yeast floating in the air, and 
unwholesome yeasts used in bread making, are the frequent 
causes of indigestion. This bread then should be used but 
sparingly, if at all. — [Mrs. S. T. Rorer. 

Salt Rising Bread I 

To 1 small cup new milk add 1 scant cup boiling water, and 
stir into this 1 large cup white corn meal, and enough flour to 
make as thick as cake batter, 1 tablesp sugar, y^ teasp salt, 
and a small pinch of soda. Set away in a moderately warm 
place over night. In the morning it will be light. Stir in a 
little warm water and a little flour to make of the proper con- 
sistency, and then set the mixing bowl in a vessel of warm 
water over the back of the stove, and by the time breakfast is 
over it will probably have risen to the top of the tin, or be 
thoroughly light. Next sift into a bread mixing pan enough 
flour for a large loaf (about 1 qt or more), .add a little lard, 
salt and sugar, and mix up with the foamy "rising," using a 
little warm water if more wetting is needed. Knead well, shape 
into loaves, put in well greased pans, and set in a warm place 
to rise. When light bake in a not too hot oven. I have used 
this recipe for 15 years, and it has never failed me. I usually 
use a quart fruit can to prepare the "rising." — [E. A. E., N. C. 

Salt Rising Bread II 

Put into a qt pitcher or jar 1 pt boiling water, 1 teasp 
su:?ar, and % teasp each soda and salt. When cool enough to 
bear your hand in it, add flour to make a thick batter, beat 
well, and put the jar or pitcher m a vessel filled with hot water 
but not hot enough to scald the mixture. Keep up a uniform 
temperature until the "rising" Is light. If set early in the 
morning, it will be ready just before noon to make sponge. 
Add 1 qt Y/arm milk and flour to make a sponge. Set in a 
warm place and when light make into loaves and let them rise 
again. Care should be taken not to let them rise too long, or 
the bread will be dry and tasteless. — [Mrs. J. A. W., Mo. 

Directions for Steaming Bread 

For moulds, if you do not have the boughten ones, use 1-Ib 
baking powder cans, or cottolene cans, or small lard pails, with 
covers to fit snugly. Butter the inside of the moulds well, and 
also the inside of the covers. Pill the moulds no more than 
two-thirds full, to allow space for swelling. If you do not own 



174 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



a "steamer," it is a good plan to set the covered mould inside 
of a larger vessel with a thin little piece of wood in the bottom, 
and fill the outside vessel with boiling water to within an inch 
of the top of the mould, but no more, as otherwise the water 
would leak into the mould while boiling. Cover the outside 
vessel securely, and boil steadily for the length of time the 
recipe calls for. It is important that the water should not stop 
boiling until the bread is done, otherwise the bread will be 
soggy. Have a kettle of hot boiling water always in readiness, 
and if necessary add a little water to the steaming vessel, if the 
water in it boils away too much. When done remove the cover 
from the mould, and put the bread in the oven about 5 or 10 
minutes, to dry and brown. — [A. G., Mass. 

Entire Wheat Bread 

Sift 2 % cups entire wheat flour with 1 scant teasp soda and 
^2 teasp salt, add 1 cup buttermilk. Mix well, then turn into 
greased pans and bake Vz hour. If liked 1 or 2 tablesp sugar 
may be added. — [J. B. J., O. 

Baked Graham Bread 

To Vz cup molasses or scant % cup brown sugar add V2 cup 
each white flour and corn meal, 2 cups each graham flour and

added last. Bake in 1-lb baking powder cans, about % hour. 
^— [Mrs. B. W. A., Cal. 

Steamed Graham Bread 

To 1 % cups graham flour add 1 cup wheat flour, Vz cup corn 
meal, 1 teasp baking powder, V2 cup sugar, 1 egg, 2 tablesp 
butter, 1 cup each sweet milk and buttermilk in which dissolve 
1 teasp soda, l^^ cups molasses, and a pinch salt. Steam 2 
hours, then bake 20 minutes. — [Mrs. E. V., N. Y. 

Baised Graham Bread I 

Early in the morning scald 1 pt fresh milk, and while hot 
add 1 teasp butter or lard, and small pinch soda. When luke- 
warm add 1 cake compressed yeast dissolved in a little luke- 
warm water. Mix well, then add 1 qt graham flour, 1 pt 
wheat flour, Vz cup sugar, and 1 teasp salt. The ingredients 
should all be lukewarm. Mix well, and if there is not quite 
enough wetting, add a little more lukewarm water. Cover, 
and set in a warm place to rise. When light (which ought to 
be in a few hours) divide into two loaves, mould on a well 
floured board, just enough to shape them into loaves. Put in 
greased tins, cover with a cloth, and set in a warm place to 
rise again. When light, bake about 1 hour, and when done»

remove from the tins immediately and place on a clean cloth 
until cold. — [Mrs. A. C, Mass. 

Raised Graham Bread U 

To 1 pt light bread sponge add 1 pt lukewarm water, and 
then stir in 1 qt graham flour, a little salt, and Vz cup sugar. 
Knead to the proper consistency with white flour, and let rise 
the same as white bread. This will make two loaves. — [Mrs. 
J. W. M., Pa. 

Rye Bread 

Sift and mix together 1 % qts rye meal, Vz qt white flour, 1 
level tablesp salt, and ^^ tablesp caraway seed. Make a hollow 
in center of flour and pour in 1 cake fresh compressed yeast 
dissolved in 1 qt lukewarm milk and water mixed, and 1 level 
tablesp melted lard. Stir in a little bit of the surrounding 
flour to make a soft sponge, cover, and set in a warm place to 
rise. At the end of 1 or 2 hours it will be light. Then work 
into the sponge the rest of the surrounding flour, using a big 
wooden spoon, and work about 10 minutes, then cover and 
again put away in a warm place to rise, which will take from 2 
to 3 hours, when it should double in bulk. Turn out on mix- 
ing board, sprinkle with white flour, and knead into loaves, 
kneading each loaf about 10 minutes. Put each loaf into 
greased pans, cover with a clean cloth, and let rise again. 
When light put into a moderately hot oven and turn bread 
every 10 minutes for the first % hour (three times), so that it 
will raise even. After the first V2 hour increase the heat some. 
After the loaves have baked 1 hour, take them out of the pans 
and put them on the bare oven shelves, and bake Vz hour 
longer. This v/ill make a nice brown crust all around. When 
done wrap in a clean cloth, and lean against something until 
cold. When compressed yeast is not on hand, V2 cake dry 
yeast may be used by starting the sponge the day before. — -

Oat Meal Bread I 

Pour 3 cups boiling water over 1 cup rolled oats, add ^ cup 
molasses or sugar, 1 tablesp lard, and 2 teasp salt. When luke- 
warm add V2 or % cake compressed yeast dissolved in a little 
lukewarm water (in winter it may be necessary to use 1 whole 
cake yeast), then add enough bread flour to make a firm 
dough, and knead. Let rise over night, then mould into two 
loaves, and when light, bake about 1^^ hours. — [G. I. C. Mass.

Oat Meal Bread 11 

Take any desired quantity of bread sponge and before you 
have kneaded it quite stiff enough, for bread, work in enough 
oat meal to make it stiff, then shape into loaves, grease well 
all over, and set in a warm place to rise. It will take longer to 
rise then ordinary white bread. When light, bake. — [Mrs. W.

of a walnut. Mix well and when lukewarm add 1 qt light 
bread sponge. When this is well mixed add % teasp soda and 
warm flour enough to knead and mould into small loaves. Put 
in well greased pans, let rise and when light bake in a moder- 
ate oven about % hour. When done remove from the pans, 
rub the loaves with butter, wring a clean cloth out of hot water, 
lay it over the bread, and let stand till cold. The crust will be 
nice and tender. Follow the same plan for softening crust of 
any bread. — [A. G., O. 

Pumpkin Bread 

To 1 cup stewed pumpkin add pinch salt, 1 egg, 2 teasp each 
sugar and molasses, 1 cup sweet milk, 1 teasp soda dissolved 
in 1 cup sour milk, and a mixture of corn meal and white flour 



178 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



enough to make a batter as for sponge cake, using % part flour 
and % part corn meal. Pour 3 or 4 tablesp thick sweet cream 
over the top of the batter just before placing the pan in the 
oven. — [Mrs. E. R. S., N. Y. 

Light Com Bread 

Add 1 tablesp sait to 1 qt water, bring to a boil and then 
stir in enough corn meal to make a medium thick mush. Let 
boil up once and remove from the fire, stir in 2 qts cold water, 
and thicken with corn meal until stiff. Cover and set in a 
warm place to rise. When it is light it will puff up, and the 
batter will crack open and seem thinner. Stir in V2 cup sugar 
and 1 cup flour, and let rise again, which will take about 15 or 
20 minutes; then pour the mixture into a deep, well greased 
pan and bake in a hot oven. — [Mrs. W. T. P., Mo. 

Corn Meal Egg Bread 

To 2^/^ cups corn meal add ^^ cup white flour, 1 teasp salt, 
2 tablesp sugar, 1 scant teasp soda dissolved in 1 cup sweet 
milk, 2 beaten eggs, and 1 cup sour milk or cream. Beat well, 
put 1 tablesp butter into a hot spider, just large enough to 
bake a cake the size of a breakfast plate, pour the batter into 
this and then pour over it 1 cup sweet milk, but do not stir. 
Bake about 25 to 30 minutes in a hot oven. When the cake is 
cut, the milk poured in last will show in delicious creamy veins 
running through it. — [Mrs. G. A. S., N. Y. 

Com Bread (No Eggs) 

To 2 cups corn meal add 1 cup flour, % cup sugar, 1 teasp 
soda and % teasp salt. Sift these ingredients well, then add

with 1 scant teasp baking powder and a little salt. Beat well, 
and then pour in the melted lard which had been placed in the 
tin pan in the oven, stir well, and then pour the mixture into 
the hot pan. Some people like a slice of bacon placed on top 
of the batter. Bake 15 minutes in a quick oven. Serve with 
fried fish or chicken. — [Mrs. H. L., Va. 

Chesterfield Corn Bread 

This is to the south what fried mush is to the north, but we 
think it more palatable and hygienic. To 1 cup corn meal add 
pinch salt and 1 scant teasp baking powder. Mix well, then stir 
in water enough to make a batter that can be poured out. Have 
a large pie pan with 1 tablesp lard in the oven getting hot while 
preparing the batter. Pour the batter into the hot pan, and

using flour, into long round strips of uniform size and shape. 
The strips should be no thicker than a thick lead pencil. Lay 
the strips in a well greased dripping pan, allowing space 
between for swelling, let rise until light, and then bake in a 
hot oven. If the braids are wanted, roll the strips to the desired 
length, pinch the tops of three of four together, and then braid 
them loosely, and pinch the ends together. Let rise and when 
light, bake. — [J. H.

Qannin^ and Preserving 

URING the spring, summer and early fall 
months, the good housekeeper on the farm 
finds her hands full, for in each of those 
seasons Mother Nature provides something 
in the line of fruit or vegetable which needs 
to be canned or preserved for use during the 
bleak and barren months of winter, begin- 
ning with the earliest berries and garden truck and winding 
up with the late pears, peaches, plums, etc., in the fall 
months. To do one's own canning and preserving means 
much warm work during the warm seasons, but it also 
means many dollars saved and a wholesome and bounteous 
table supply for the greater part of the year. Therefore, 
every good housekeeper is interested in canning and pre- 
serving recipes, and it is hoped that among the following 
she will find many that will please her and perhaps point 
the way to new methods or combinations. 

Methods of Canning 

There are two canning methods most generally used, the 
first being to boil the fruit in a syrup and then filling into 
the jars and sealing while hot. The second method is a little 
more troublesome, but thought by many cooks to be the 
best. The glass cans are filled with the fruit and sugar or 
juice, raw or partly cooked, the covers adjusted loosely, and 
the cans then set in a boiler of water and boiled for a pre- 
scribed time. Hay or pieces of wood are first placed in the 
bottom of the boiler, and hay or cloths packed between the 
jars, so they will not crack, and the water is allowed to come 
almost but not quite up to the tops of the jars. The boiler 
is closely covered during the boiling process, to retain the 
steam. When they have boiled or steamed long enough the 
jars are removed from the boiler, each one filled full with 
j-uice or syrup, the rubbers adjusted, and the covers screwed 
down as tight as possible. 

183 



184 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

About the Jars for Canning 

Of course, the jars must be perfectly clean, the covers 
ditto, and fit exactly, and the rubbers new and of good quality. 
Sometimes, though very seldom, two old rubbers that seem 
good can be used in place of one new one, but it is always 
more or less of a risk to try this. Jars, covers and rubbers 
about which there is the least bit of doubt had better be 
kept for very sweet or spiced preserves, catsups or. hot rel- 
ishes, that do not spoil easily. The wise housekeeper, as 
soon as she empties a glass jar of its contents, immediately 
washes and dries the jar, cover and rubber band, and puts 
the jar away in a dust-proof place with the rubber band and 
a small lump of charcoal inside and the cover screwed on 
loosely. This saves time and trouble for the next canning 
season, when the task of fitting cans and covers is especially 
wearysome. However, if this was not done, it will be nec- 
essary to try all the cans and covers. This is best done the 
evening before they are wanted. Wash and rinse the jars 
and covers thoroughly, using some baking soda with hot 
water, until you are sure each jar is sweet and clean. Then 
put some clean water in each jar, put on the rubbers and 
the covers that seem to fit best, screw tight, and let the jars 
stand on their heads all night. The leaky ones can then be 
easily taken out the next morning, and perhaps tried with 
other covers, or set aside for other use. The foregoing direc- 
tions apply chiefly to the old-fashioned glass cans with 
zinc porcelain-lined covers — when the new glass covered 
snap or lightning jars are used, there need be no matching of 
covers and jars. 

Heating and Filling Jars 

If hot fruit and syrup are poured into cold glass jars, they 
will immediately crack. Warm jars by placing them in hot 
water on the back of the stove, and when ready to fill stand 
the jars on a folded towel wrung out of hot water. A silver 
fork or spoon placed in the jar while it is being filled is also 
said to be effective in preventing cracking from heat. The 
jars must be overflowing full when the covers are put on, 
and great care should be taken that no air bubbles remain 
in the jar. To break these up, gently run a silver knife 
through the contents, just before the final filling up. If not 
quite enough syrup is on hand to fill the jars full to over- 
flowing, a little boiling water may be poured in each. Seal 
while hot, screwing down the lids as tight as possible. Before 
they are quite cold, try if they can be screwed any tighter. 
If properly fitting covers and good, new rubbers were used, 
the jars will be sealed air tight, but if there is any doubtJ

about this, let them stand on their heads over night. Those 
that show any signs of leaking will have to be opened and 
the contents heated over again, and put in jars with better 
fitting covers. Store all canned goods in a cool, dark and 
dry place. A paper bag slipped over each jar will help ex- 
clude light. — [A. G., Mass. 

About Salicylic Acid 

A number of recipes for canning and preserving, which 
call for salicylic acid to help the preserving process, were 
received by the editor of this book, but have been omitted 
because it was deemed unwise to recommend them, inasmuch 
as salicylic acid, if used at all, must be used with the greatest 
caution. Salicylic acid is a drug which should only be pre- 
scribed by a competent physician fully aw^are of the condi- 
tion of his patient. It is dangerous to partake of it fre- 
quently, however small the quantity may be. What is meat 
for one man may be poison for another. Chemical preserva- 
tives should never be used in putting up articles of food. 
Our national pure food laws have recently made wise pro- 
visions in this respect. — [Editor. 

Canned Cherries 

Pick cherries over carefully, discarding all wormy and un- 
ripe ones. Allow 1 cup sugar for each qt jar of fruit. Put 
the cherries and sugar in layers in the jars until they are 
nearly full, then arrange the jars in a boiler, first placing a 
layer of straw in the bottom of the boiler and also pack some 
straw between the jars. Cover the jars but do not put on 
the rubbers. Then pour enough water into the boiler to 
come nearly to the top of the jars but not enough so that 
any of it can run into the jars. Cover the boiler and let 
boil until the sugar in the jars is melted and forms a clear 
syrup. Meanwhile have more syrup in a preserving kettle, 
and when the fruit is ready, take out the jars, one at a 
time, fill up full with the boiling hot syrup, put on the rub- 
bers, and seal at once. Be sure to have the glass overflowing 
full with syrup. — [M. C, Va. 

To Can whole Cherries Cold 

Use freshly picked, carefully selected cherries, not over- 
ripe and with the stems on, wash and drain them carefully 
and fill into cans, but do not pit them or remove the stems, 
and be careful not to break the stems. Fill the cans with 
fresh cold water, shake well to be sure there are no air 
bubbles in the can, then fill to overflowing with fresh water 



186 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

and seal at once. When opened they will he just like fresh 
picked cherries, and you can serve them Christmas time and set 
your guests to wondering where you got fresh cherries. They 
must be sealed air tight, and stored in a dark, dry and coal 
place. — [Mrs. L. W., O. 

Cherry Preserves 

Wash the cherries thoroughly at least 3 times, then drain 
well and weigh. To each lb cherries allow 1 lb sugar and boil 
until most of the cherries have broken to pieces. If liked, 
add 1 sliced lemon (seeds discarded), to every 4 qts of the 
preserves and boil together with the preserves until done. 
Put up in stone jars. — [Miss K. B., Minn. 

Soiir Cherry Preserve 

For each lb carefully selected cherries, allow 1 lb sugar. 
Put the sugar in a perserving kettle and add 1 small cup cold 
water to every lb sugar and boil until the syrup is transparent, 
taking care not to let it scorch or burn, and skimming off 
all skum that rises to the surface. After this put in the 
cherries and let them boil for 15 minutes, then skim out the 
cherries and put them into glass jars. Let the syrup boil 
down some and add to it any of the juice that has drained 
off the cherries in the jar. When the syrup is boiled suffi- 
ciently, fill up the jars with it and seal at once. Store in a cool 
dark, and dry place. — [Mrs. O. M. P., N. H. 

Canned Baked Apples 

Fill a large pudding dish with sour apples, pared, cored 
and quartered. Sprinkle with % cup sugar for each qt apples 
and add a sprinkle of cinnamon if liked. Pour in about 1 
cup water, cover closely and bake several hours in a moderate 
oven, or until the apples turn red. Fill at once into hot fruit 
cans and seal air tight. — [I. A. S., Me. 

Candied Apples 

Preserve the apples in the usual way, usin? 1 lb sugar to 1 
lb fruit. When the apples are done and just before removing 
the kettle from the fire, dissolve 1 tablesp cream of tartar 
(more or less according to the quantity of apples used) in a 
little water and add this to the preserved fruit, stirring 
gently. Pour the fruit into jars, let stand about 10 days or 2 
weeks, then drain the fruit from the syrup and spread on 
platters and let dry in a cool room, first dipping each piece 
of fruit in granulated sugar. This is a fine substitute for 
citron in cakes or puddings. — [L. E. M., Mich. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 187 

Pickled Apples 

Boil together 1 qt vinegar and 6 cups brown sugar. When 
it has come to a boil, skim and add 1 teasp each cloves, cin- 
namon and allspice, then fill the boiling spiced syrup full 
with sweet apples that have been washed and wiped dry, cut 
in halves and the cores removed. Do not pare the apples. 
Let boil until soft but not soft enough to break. Can and 
seal air tight. Give the cans a little shake, once in a while, 
when filling them, so the contents will settle down and the 
air bubbles break. Be sure to fill the cans overflowing full. 
— [M. P., N. H. 

Crabapple Preserves 

Allow 1 lb sugar for every lb of carefully selected ripe, 
red crabapples. Wipe the apples clean but leave the stems 
on and scald them in boiling water. Make a syrup of the 
sugar, adding a very little water, and when the sugar is boiled 
clear, put in the fruit and boil until soft. Then skim out the 
apples carefully and put them into jars. Boil the juice down 
until it is quite thick. Drain out the liquid collected in the 
jars and add it to the boiling juice. When suflaciently thick, 
pour it over the fruit, having each jar as full as possible. Seal 
while hot. These may be put up in small stone jars, but in. 
that case, do not cover the jars until the contents are 
thoroughly cold. — [M. P., N. H. 

Spiced Crabapples 

Thoroughly heat 1 pt vinegar and 4 lbs sugar, then add 6 
lbs crabapples, chopped fine, 2 lbs raisins, seeded and chopped, 
the grated rind and juice of 2 lemons, 1 teasp cloves and 2 
teasp cinnamon. Cook slowly until the apples are done. 
Oan and seal. — [Mrs. F. D. D., N. Y. 

Canned Pineapple 

Pick out the eyes and peel, and slice i/4 inch thick and core 
sound, ripe pineapples. Cut into small dice or chips and put 
over the fire in a preserving kettle, adding 1 cup sugar Tor 
each qt fruit, and water enough to cover. Cook until tender, 
then turn into jars and seal while hot. — [Mrs. C. W. K., 111. 

Canned Currants 

For 3 lbs carefully selected stemmed, washed and drained 
currants, allow 1 lb sugar. Put the fruit and the sugar 
together to boil about 10 minutes or until the juice is pretty 
well extracted, then carefully skim out the fruit and let the 
juice boil about 20 minutes, after which return the fruit 
to the juice again and let cook long enough to heat through. 
Then can and seal air tight. — [Mrs. B. B., Mo. 



188 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

To Can Currants Cold 

Select good, ripe currants, remove stems, wash and drain, 
and allow equal weight of sugar. Wash the currants and be 
sure that every single one is crushed. Mix thoroughly with 
the sugar and let stand over night. Next morning stir well, 
and when all the sugar is dissolved, put it in air-tight fruit 
cans and set away in a cool, dark and dry place. Be sure 
to have the cans full and to pack them closely, so that no air 
bubbles will remain in them. — [Mrs. W. L. J., Vt. 

Spiced Currants 

Put 1 tablesp ground cinnamon and 1 teasp whole cloves 
in a little cheese cloth bag and let it simmer slowly about 15 
minutes with 1 cup vinegar and 4 lbs sugar. Then add 4 lbs 
currants and boil slowly till rich and thick. Remove spice 
bag and can and seal while hot. Stoned cherries may be 
prepared the same way. Boil 1 cup cherry stones in the bag 
with the spices. — [Mrs. J. P. D., Neb. 

Quince Preserves 

Pare and quarter the fruit, removing the core and hard 
parts, then weigh and allow % lb sugar to 1 lb quinces. 
Cover the fruit with water and boil slowly until tender. Then 
skim out the fruit, strain the juice if necessary, put the sugar 
in the juice, and cook and skim until it is a thick syrup, then 
return the quinces to the syrup and cook until they are of 
the desired shade and thickness. Put up hot in air-tight jars. 
The flavor will be improved if a tart apple or a little apple 
juice is added. — [Mrs. J. L. R., O. 

Canned Grapes 

Pick carefully selected ripe grapes from stems and put 
in 1-qt jars. Allow 1 cup sugar and 3 cups water for each 
Qt can and boil until it syrups. Place the grape-filled cans on 
the stove shelf, where they may become warm, have a tea- 
kettle filled with freshly boiled water, and when the cans 
are thoroughly warmed so they will not break, fill 1 can at 
a time as rapidly as possible with clear boiling water, pour off 
immediately, and then fill with the boiling syrup and seal at 
once. — [Mrs. M. B. W., N. Y. 

Canned Grapes (No Sugar) 

Use only good, ripe grapes, separate pulp and skins, throw- 
ing them in separate vessels. Put the pulp over the fire with a 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 1S» 

very little water and boil slowly until the seeds separate. 
Then rub through a sieve to remove the seeds, return the pulp 
to the preserving kettle containing the skins, and cook well 
together, stirring often to prevent scorching. When the skins 
are tender, fill into jars and seal air tight. — [Miss B. K., Ind. 

Grape Preserves I 

Pick over ripe grapes, carefully discarding faulty ones, 
press out pulp, preserving skins or hulls. For every lb hull3 
allow 1 lb brown sugar. Put in preserving kettle and let 
stand over night, then put over the fire and cook until thick. 
This makes a very rich and "winey" preserve. It needs no 
flavoring. The pulp can be boiled with a very little water 
and then rubbed through a colander to remove the seeds 
and then boiled with an equal quantity of sugar for jam.— - 
[Mrs. G. W. C Tex. 

Grape Preserves 11 

Use only good, ripe grapes, wash and drain, separate the 
pulps and skins and throw them in separate vessels. Cook 
the skins with barely enough water to cover and cook the 
pulp in another kettle in its own juice until the seeds separate, 
then rub through a colander and add the strained pulp to the 
skins, which should have boiled nearly dry by that time^ 
Measure and allow an equal measure of sugar. After the 
pulp has been added to the skins, let this mixture cook 26 
minutes, stirring often, then add % of the sugar and boil 5 
minutes, add another ^A of the sugar, again boil 5 minutes, 
and proceed this way until the sugar is all used and the skins 
are soft. — [L. A. S., Me. 

Spiced Grapes 

Separate the pulps and skins of 4 qts grapes, putting them 
in separate vessels. Cook the pulp until the seeds separate, 
then strain through a colander and add to the skins with 
Zy2 lbs brown sugar, V2 pt vinegar, 1 tablesp cinnamon, and 
% tablesp each cloves and allspice. Boil slowly about 2% 
hours, or until the skins are tender. — [F. M. P., Mass. 

Canned Pears 

Put 1 teasp each of cinnamon and nutmeg in a little cteese 
cloth bag and drop it into a syrup made of 1 % lbs sugar and 
1% cups water. Slice in 2 lemons, pits removed, and let boil 
until it thickens like syrup. Then add 3 lbs ripe pears, 
weighed after peeling, and cook until the pears are done 
and of a delicate pink color. Remove the spice bag before 
pouring into jars. Seal while hot. — [C. B. H., Mich, 



190 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Chipped or Spiced Pears 

Cut 8 lbs pears into small dice or chips, cover with 6 lbs 
sugar, and let stand over night. Next morning add the grated 
rind and juice of 3 lemons and 2 ozs white ginger root. Sim- 
mer slowly about 3 hours and can while hot. — [Mrs. L. G., Cal. 

Canned Pliims 

Wash 2 lbs plums, red, blue, yellow or green Gage. Prick 
them with a silver fork or a steel knitting needle (to keep 
the skins from breaking while boiling) and then put the 
plums whole into a thick, boiling syrup made by boiling 
together 1 lb sugar and 1 pt water. Boil the plums in this 
mixture about 8 or 10 minutes, or until tender. Seal while 
hot. Cherries may be canned in the same manner. — [K. A. D., 
N. D. 

Preserved Plums 

Make a syrup of 1 lb sugar and Vz cup water and when boil- 
ing briskly, drop in 1 lb plums that have been washed and 
drained, cut in halves and the pits removed. Boil gently until 
the plums are done. Seal while hot in glass jars. — [Mrs. B. E. 
T., Va. 

Spiced Plums 

Wash and prick % gal plums, cover with water and boil 5 
minutes, then pour off the water and add to the plums 3 lbs 
sugar, 1 pt vinegar and 1 teasp each ground cloves, allspice 
and cinnamon. Boil about 30 minutes, stirring frequently. 
Can and seal while hot. — [M. B., 111. 

Canned Whole Peaches 

Select firm, medium sized peaches, free from decay, a trifle 
under-ripe is better than over-ripe, pare, but do not remove 
the stones. Throw the fruit into cold water as fast as pared 
to keep it from turning dark, but do not let it remain long in 
the water, or the flavor will be lost. Make a syrup of 1 pt 
sugar and 1 qt water for every 4 lbs peaches. Place the fruit, 
after draining off, in a shallow, wide preserving kettle, and 
pour the hot syrup over it and cook gently until the fruit is 
easily pierced by a straw. Transfer the fruit carefully to glass 
jars, fill almost to the top with hot syrup, then run a silver 
knife around inside the jar to let out the air bubbles. Fill 
quickly overflowing full with the hot syrup and screw down 
the cover as tight as possible. If some of the juice overflows 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 191 

on the rubber during the sealing process, it will do no injury, 
but will rather aid in the sealing. Peaches canned whole in. 
this way are delicious — much better than when the stones are 
removed, as they impart a fine flavor. — [L. O. C, Ala. 

To Can Peaches Without Boiling 

Peel good, not over-ripe peaches, cut in halves and fill into 
jars which have been placed in boiling water. Then cover imme- 
diately with a hot syrup made of 1 pt sugar and 1^ pts 
water. Have the cans overflowing full and be sure there are 
no air bubbles in them. Then seal at once while hot and 
allow the cans to stand submerged in hot water until they have 
all cooled. This method far surpasses the old-fashioned 
method of canning, and the fruit will retain its fresh flavor. — • 
[A. McL., 111. This method is also vouched for by Mrs. E. F. 
G., N. Y. 

Peach Preserves 

Pare peaches and mix with sugar and let stand over night. 
Allow 4 lbs sugar to 5 lbs fruit. Next morning, put over the 
fire and boil 20 minutes, then skim out the fruit with a per- 
forated spoon and spread on a flat dish to cool and harden. 
Let the syrup boil until it almost begins to candy, then return 
the fruit to the syrup and boil very slowly 10 minutes. Seal 
in glass jars while hot. If the syrup has not cooked long 
enough, the preserves are likely to ferment, and the riper the 
fruit, the longer it will take to boil the water out of tne syrup. 
— [Mrs. A. A. W., N. C. 

Sweet Pickled Peaches 

Prepare a syrup of 4 lbs brown sugar, 1 qt best cider vine- 
gar and 2 ozs stick cinnamon. Boil 20 minutes. Prepare 
peaches by putting them a few minutes in boiling water and 
slipping off the skins. Put enough of these peeled peaches in 
the syrup to cover the bottom of the kettle, and cook until 
tender. Fill glass jars with the peaches, pour the boiling syrup 
over them and seal. — [M. B. G., Wis. 

Preserved Citron Melons 

Peel the melons, remove the seeds and cut into small slices 
about Vz inch thick. For every 6 lbs melon allow 3 lbs sugar, 
the juice and yellow rind of 4 lemons and a small piece of 
green ginger root. Boil the melons in a little water about 
Vz hour, or until they look clear and can be pierced with a 
straw. Then drain, cover with cold water and let stand over 



192 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

night. Next morning tie the ginger root in a clieese cloth hag 
and hoil it in 3 pts water until the water is highly flavored 
with the ginger. Then remove the ginger, add the sugar, and 
when the sugar is melted, add the thin yellow peel of the lem- 
ons and boil and skim until no more skum rises. Remove the 
lemon peel and add the lemon juice and the sliced citron, thor- 
oughly drained from the cold water, and boil all together 
until the citron is quite transparent and soft, but not soft 
enough to break. Can while hot in air-tight jars. — [Miss J. 
R. W., Kan. 

Watermelon Preserves ^ 

Pare the green rind from the melon, discard the soft pulp 
and seeds, using only the solid parts of the rind. Cut into 
small pieces, weigh and allow 7 lbs sugar for 10 lbs melon, 2 
sliced lemons, seeds discarded and a little piece of ginger root 
(the ginger may be omitted if the flavor is not liked). Boil 
all together until the melon is clear and the juice is thick. — • 
[Mrs. B. F. G., 111. 

Cantaloupe Presei*ves 

Half ripe cantaloupe or muskmelons are best for preserves. 
Remove peel and seeds, cut in small pieces and for every 3 
lbs melon, allow 2 lbs sugar. Put melons and sugar in pre- 
serving kettle and let stand a few hours to draw the juice, 
then boil until the syrup is thick and the fruit tender. Can 
while hot in air-tight jars. Any flavoring that is liked may be 
added while boiling. — [Mrs. S. B., Tex. 

Preserved Elderberries 

To 7 lbs elderberries add boiling water to cover. Let stand 
about 15 minutes and then drain. Chop fine 3 lemons, remov- 
ing seeds, then add them to the drained elderberries with % 
pt vinegar and 5 lbs sugar. Let boil about 15 minutes, then 
skim out the berries and boil the juice down thick, after which 
add the berries again and boil 13 minutes longer. Can be 
put up in stone jars or discarded jars for canning, that are not 
air tight. — [Miss L. M. B., N. Y. 

Canned Huckleberries 

Put 6 qts huckleberries and 2 lbs sugar in a preserving ket- 
tle over the fire and let simmer gently a few minutes until the 
sugar is melted, then allow them to come to a boil and boil 4 
or 5 minutes. Can at once in air-tight jars. — [Mrs. C. vonW.,

Canned Blueberries 

Pick over carefully and wash and drain ripe blueberries, 
and stew them in their own juice, with a very little water 
added at first to keep the lower ones from sticking to the ket- 
tle. When all are well cooked through turn them at once into 
warm jars and seal air tight. They will keep without sugar 
and are nice for pies. — [L. A. S., Me. 

Canned Gooseberries — Green or Wild 

Remove stems and flower ends and wash carefully in warm 
water and drain thoroughly. To 1 qt gooseberries add 1 cup 
water and 2 cups sugar. Cook slowly 1 hour and then turn 
into fruit cans and seal while hot. This will keep indefinitely 
if sealed air tight and stored in a dark, cool place. — [Mrs. L. 
A. G., Me. 

To Can Gooseberries Without Sugar 

Remove stem and blossom ends from carefully selected ripe 
gooseberries and put in a preserving kettle with just enough 
water to come up through them, but not quite cover them. Let 
boil just long enough for the gooseberries to turn from the 
original color to a clear yellow, and then pour into jars and 
seal immediately. Canned in this v/ay they retain their 
natural, fresh fiavor. — [Mrs. B. T. W., Mo. 

Rhubarb and Gooseberry Preserves 

Boil together equal parts of rhubarb and gooseberries, and 
when soft, strain through a sieve, then return to the fire and 
boil until it looks clear and begins to thicken. Then add 
sugar of equal- weight with the fruit, measured before boiling, 
and boil about 15 minutes longer. Pour into jelly glasses or 
jars, and when perfectly cold, cover with melted paraffine or 
paper. This need not be sealed air tight, — [Mrs. F. E. A., 
Wash. 

Spiced Blackberries 

To 5 qts blackberries add 1 qt vinegar, 3 lbs sugar, 1 tablesp 
cloves and ^A tablesp each allspice and cinnamon. Put the 
spices in a cheese cloth bag and boil them with the berries 
until they are of the consistency of preserves. Remove the 
spice bag and can, not necessarily air tight.- — [Mrs. S. Q., 
Tenn. 



194 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Canned Raspberries 

Pill fruit jars with carefully selected ripe, red raspberries, 
and fill full to overflowing with a thick hot syrup made of 
sugar and water. Seal the jars tight and submerge them in a 
tank or boiler of boiling hot water, and allow them to remain 
there until they are cold. Cover the boiler and throw a carpet 
or quilt over it to retain the heat. Be sure the cans are sealed 
air tight. — £Mrs. R. K., Pa. 

Raspberry Preserves 

Make a thick syrup by boiling together 2 cups sugar and % 
cup water, and when clear add 2 cups carefully selected ripe 
red raspberries, and boil 5 minutes longer. Can air tight. 
This make 1 pt. — [Mrs. R. K., Pa. 

To Can Raspberries Without Cooking 

"Wash, drain and mash ripe, red raspberries. Be sure that 
each berry is thoroughly mashed. Add an equal measure of 
sugar and stir, on and off, for 3 or 4 hours, or until all the 
sugar is melted and the acid gases have evaporated. Then fill 
into jars, pack tight and overflowing full, and seal air tight. 
When opened this will taste like the fresh berries, and is nice 
to use for shortcakes. — [Mrs. R. K., Pa. 

Canned Strawberries 

Allow 2 qts strawberries for a 1-qt jar. Select only the fin- 
est berries, fully ripe and of a deep, dark color. Hull, wash 
and drain 2 qts berries. Put about 2 or 3 tablesp berries on 
a plate and with a fork crush each berry and mix together 
thoroughly. Put these crushed berries in a preserving kettle 
with 1 cup of the best granulated sugar and put over the fire 
and let it heat up. When the sugar is dissolved put in what 
remains of the 2 qts of berries, and as soon as they have 
boiled and heated through thoroughly, carefully skim them 
out, put them in a glass jar, and if the remaining syrup seems 
too thin, or there is more than needed for filling the jar, let 
it boil down some more and then pour it boiling hot over the 
berries in the jar. Never attempt to do more than 2 qts at a 
time, in the manner described above. Any remaining juice 
should be boiled down to a jelly with the addition of a little 
more sugar, or it may be bottled and sealed, to use as a fla- 
voring for sauces, cakes, ice cream or sherbet. Be sure to use 
only the best berries, fully ripe and of a dark red color, and 
be sure to use only the best granulated sugar. Can and seal 
while hot and use the same precautions as in canning all other 
fruits. Set away in a cool, dark and dry place. — [Mrs. R. B. 
v., Okla. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 195 



Canned Strawberries Without Cooking 

Fill a qt can about % full of selected ripe strawberries, 
which have been hulled, washed and thoroughly drained, and 
then pour over them a syrup made by boiling together 5 min- 
utes 1 y2 cups sugar and 1 cup water. Pour the syrup over the 
fruit boiling hot, and seal at once. Screw down the covers as 
tight as possible and then set the jars in a pail or boiler and 
fill up with boiling water, entirely covering the cans. Cover 
the boiler and throw a thick cloth or carpet over it, and leave 
it undisturbed until the water is cold. Then take out the jars, 
and if the covers can be screwed any tighter, do so. This will 
keep very nicely for a year or more, and they will be found to 
be of a delicious, fresh flavor when opened. — [Mrs. W. G., 
N. Y. 

StrawbeiTy Preserves 

Hull, wash, drain and mash 4 qts strawberries and put 
them over the fire in a preserving kettle and bring slowly to a 
boil. Then strain through a jelly bag, pressing to extract the 
juice. To every pt juice add 1 pt sugar and boil all together 
briskly about 10 minutes, removing all skum that arises to 
the surface. Then, add 4 qts firm, ripe berries, and simmer 
gently for 10 minutes, after which skim out the berries care- 
fully, place into jars, fill with the boiling hot syrup, and seal 
at once. Raspberries may be preserved the same way, with 
the juice of 1 lemon added to every 4 lbs raspberries. — [Mrs. 
J. P. D., Neb. 

Baked Canned Rhubarb 

Cut up rhubarb, mix with the required amount of sugar, 
and put in a covered dish in hot oven, but add no water. 
When done, this will be a fine, rich sauce. Can while hot. — 

When rhubarb is in season, can a lot of the juice made into 
a thin syrup. It will help to make a fine jelly when cherries 
are ripe by using % rhubarb and ^/^ cherry juice. — [F. W. C, 
N. Y. 

To Can Rhubarb in Cold Water 

Fresh, tender, young rhubarb need not be peeled as a rule. 
Wash, cut up in small pieces, pack into cans and fill with 
pure, running cold water. Let settle, then fill with water 
again, fill to overflowing, and seal air tight. Keep in a cool, 
dark and dry place, and when wanted, simply drain off the 
water and proceed as with fresh rhubarb. — [Mrs. D. W. B., 
N. Y. 



196 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Canned Rhnbarb and Strawberries 

Peel rhubarb, cut in small pieces and put over fire with 1 
Qt sugar and a very little water. When done add 1 qt strawber- 
ries, cook about 5 or 10 minutes longer, and can and seal 
while hot. — [Mrs. E. F. H., N. Y. 

Preserved Pumpkin 

Slice 5 lbs pumpkin and 5 lemons in thin slices, discarding 
seeds, add 5 lbs sugar, mix thoroughly, and let stand in an 
earthen vessel about 2 days, in a cold place, after which let it 
boil gently till the pumpkin is clear and almost transparent. 
Can and seal. — [Mrs. C. L. C, Mass. 

To Can Pumpkins or Squash 

As soon as my pumpkins or squash show signs of not keep- 
ing, I peel and cut them up and boil them till well done in 
just enough water to cover, then can and seal in air-tight jars. 
The cans must be overflowing full and the juice must cover 
the pumpkins, and all other canning precautions must be 
strictly observed. — [Mrs. A. W. S., Pa. 

Canned Sweet Red Peppers 

Wash dry 1 pk red bell peppers, cut a thin slice from the stem 
end of each and remove the seeds, then cut round and round 
the peppers with a pair of scissors, making strips i/4 inch wide 
and as long as possible — in one piece, if this can be managed, 
something like a cne-piece apple paring. Next cover the pep- 
per strips with boiling water, then drain off the water imme- 
diately and repeat this if the peppers are liked very mild. 
Next, put into ice water, using plenty of ice to chill thoroughly, 
then drain and pack solidly in pt jars. Boil 1 qt vinegar and 
2 cups sugar to the consistency of syrup, pour over the pep- 
pers in the jars and seal. Keep in a cold, dark and dry place. 
The above quantities will fill 4 pt jars. Peppers thus prepared 
retain their pretty red color and are nice for garnishing salads 
or for making cheese and pepper sandwiches. — [E. G. C, 
Washington, D. C. 

To Can Cucumbers Sweet 

Select firm cucumbers about 2 inches long, wash and dry 
carefully and pack in a gal jar with small pieces of horse- 
radish. Bring 1 qt cider vinegar and 1 cup sugar to a boil 
and pour it over the cucumbers, while boiling hot. Cover and 
set away in a cool place over night. Next morning drain off 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 197 



tlie vinegar, boil it over again, and pour it over ttie cucum- 
bers, and repeat this 3 mornings, after which seal air tight 
and keep in a cool, dark and dry place. The can should be 
full to overflowing when sealed. — [Mrs. E. R. McC, Tenn, 

Cuctunber Preserves 

Use firm, ripe cucumbers, just turning yellow, peel, dis- 
card seeds and cut in 2 or 3-inch pieces. Soak in weak salt 
water about 8 hours, then drain and dry carefully with a clean 
towel and drop into a boiling syrup made of 2 qts cider vine- 
gar, 2 V2 lbs sugar and Vz oz mixed whole spices. Put the 
spices in a small cheese cloth bag. Boil slowly 20 minutes, 
then take out the spice bag and boil the cucumbers in the 
syrup until they are soft and transparent, after which skim 
out the pieces, drain thoroughly, put them in a glass jar, 
boil syrup until thick, pour over the cucumbers, and seal. — 
[Mrs. J. D. C. Cal. 

To Can Peas 

Can peas immediately after gathering. Shell them, and 
pack them in the cans as tightly as possible without breaking 
them, add a little salt, then fill the cans overflowing full with 
cold water, pouring it in until all bubbles have disappeared. 
Put on rubbers and covers, but do not screw the covers tight. 
Place the cans in a boiler with the usual packing on the bot- 
tom and between the cans, pour in cold water within an inch 
of the tops of the cans, cover the boiler, bring to a boil, and 
boil for 3 hours. Then remove boiler from fire, screw the 
covers on the cans as tightly as possible, and leave in the hot 
water until cold. — £Miss G. R., N. Y. 

To Can String Beans 

Wash, drain and break in pieces tender, meaty, freshly gath- 
ered, green string beans or butter beans, and cook until almost 
done in well salted water. Turn into glass jars, and into each 
can pour 2 tablesp hot vinegar. Fill up with the juice and seal 
air tight. When ready to use, if the beans are too salty, or the 
vinegar taste is not liked, soak them a little in clear water, and 
finish by cooking them with salt pork. — [Mrs. S. D. P., O. 

To Can String Beans With Bacon 

String tender, freshly gathered beans, break in small pieces, 
and put over the fire with water enough to cover. Place a 
piece of boneless breakfast bacon in the center of the beans. 
Use about 1 lb bacon to ^ pk beans. Cook until tender, then 
pack the beans in cans, hot. Lay a slice of bacon on the top of 



198 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



each, about 

the beans were boiled, and seal. Be sure that there are no air 
bubbles in the can. This recipe has been used in our family for 
three generations, and if properly packed, free from air, and 
sealed air tight, the beans thus canned will keep two years or 
more. When ready to use, heat the beans thoroughly, and they 
are ready to serve, and will be found to be as delicious as if 
they had just come from the garden. — [Mrs. E. E. W., Pa 

To Can Beets 

Cook and peel the beets in the usual way. To each qt beets 
allow V2 pt vinegar and V2 pt water, to which add ^ cup 
sugar, V2 teasp mixed spices, and a little horseradish, which 
keeps the beets from turning white. Let all come to a boil, 
drop in the beets, boil up once more, and fill the cans with 
beets, being careful to cover them fully with the spiced vine- 
gar. Seal air tight in the usual way. — [Mrs. L. W., Ind. 

Canned Sweet Com I 

Only good, deep, milky, ripe corn is worth while canning. 
Pick, strip and cook immediately, the same as for table use. 
Then with a sharp knife shave off the kernels, but do not cut 
too near the cob. After cutting scrape the balance of the corn, 
and milk from the cobs, using the back of a silver knife. Use 
2 tablesp salt for each qt corn and add a very little sugar, if 
liked, but if the corn is sweet, sugar will not be necessary. 
Put over the fire in a porcelain-lined kettle with barely enough 
water to cover and let it boil until tender, stirring frequently 
to prevent burning. Fill jars while boiling hot, to within i^ 
inch of the top, being careful to pack solidly and to break all 
the air bubbles by running a silver spoon or fork through the 
contents. Then fill to overflowing with melted butter and 
screw on the covers tightly. When opened freshen corn in 
clear water, add a little milk, and it will taste like fresh corn. 
— [Mrs. M. R., N. Y. 

Canned Sweet Com II 

Pick, cut and scrape corn as directed in recipe No. 1. Then 
measure the corn and to 6 qts allow 1 oz tartaric acid. When 
the corn is done, dissolve the acid in some hot water, stir it in 
and cook 5 minutes longer. Then can and seal while hot. 
When ready to use, heat the corn, dissolve V2 teasp bi-carbon- 
ate of soda in a little water or milk and stir this into the corn, 
adding seasoning to taste. Canned thus, I have been told that 
mine tasted just like the canned, tinned corn bought in stores. 
s— [No name. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 199 



Canned Corn Salad 

To 18 ears green corn, cut from the cob, add 4 large onions, 
2 green peppers or 1 ripe pepper, 1 large white cabbage, all 
ellopped fine, scant i/4 cup salt and 1 qt vinegar. Cook about 
15 minutes. Boil together 1 qt vinegar, 2 tablesp ground 
mustard, 1 teasp cinnamon, 2 cups sugar and 1 scant cup flour. 
When done add to the above mixture and cook all together 
until thoroughly mixed and heated through. Can hot and seaL 
.— [R. W., Mo. 

Canned Corn and Tomatoes 

Select perfectly sound, ripe tomatoes and full tender corn. 
Peel the tomatoes and remove the green cores. Cut and 
scrape the corn from the cob and boil the corn and tomatoes 
together, allowing a cup of tomatoes to a qt of corn. Salt, boil 
until done and can in the usual way. — [Mrs. J. L. R., O. 

Green Tomato Preserves 

For each lb green tomatoes allow % lb sugar, and % lemon. 
Melt the sugar in a very little water, add the grated rind and 
juice of the lemon then put in the green tomatoes, washed, 
trimmed and cut in quarters, but not peeled. Cook gently 
until tomatoes are tender and transparent. If desired, a little 
ginger root can be cooked with the tomatoes, or the preserves 
can be flavored with cinnamon or cloves. This will keep with- 
out sealing air tight, but it is better to put up in small jars, as 
it is so rich that only a little is wanted at a time. — [L. S., Me. 

To Can Ripe Tomatoes 

Use only good, firm, ripe tomatoes, discarding all doubtful 
and imperfect ones. Peel with a sharp knife, or by scalding 
them in hot water a few minutes, cut out all the hard parts, 
and cut the tomatoes in halves or quarters, according to their 
size. Put in a perfectly clean preserving kettle of agate ware, 
or porcelain lined, and be sure that no taste or odor, or any 
sign of its previous contents are noticeable. Set on the back of 
the stove a few minutes to extract the juices, then draw to the 
front and let them boil 15 or 20 minutes, or until tender, and 
thoroughly heated through. A little salt to taste may be 
added, if desired, but it is not necessary, and the tomatoes may 
be strained or not, before canning. I think it is better not to 
strain them. Have the sterilized jars and covers ready in the 
usual way, fill up the jars with the boiling hot tomatoes, pass 
a silver fork or spoon through the contents to cut the air bub- 
bles, shake the jar gently to settle contents, and when you are 
absolutely sure that it is packed as closely as possible, and 



200 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



there are no more air bubbles in the can, fill to overflowing 
with the juice and screw on the hot covers a,s tight as possible. 
Put no more of the juice in the cans than necessary. The sur- 
plus juice can be bottled and sealed separately and used for 
soup flavorings, etc. If the tomatoes were good, and no 
decayed spots or particles were allowed to slip in, and if the 
jars and covers were properly sterilized, and the rubbers were 
new, and the covers fitted perfectly, and if no air was canned in 
with the tomatoes, then there is absolutely no reason why they 
should spoil. Be absolutely sure that the jars are sealed air 
tight, and when cooled brush edge of the lids with melted par- 
affine. Do not lift the cans by the tops as this Vv^ould loosen 
the lids. Slip a paper bag over each can, and store in a cool, 
dark and dry place. It is best not to attempt to can tomatoes 
on a very hot, or sultry day, when the air is damp and full of 
unwholesome germs, and it is also best not to attempt to do 
too much canning in one day. — [A. G., Mass. 

Spiced Ripe Tomatoes 

To 12 lbs ripe tomatoes, peeled and sliced, add 4 lbs brown 
sugar, 1 qt vinegar, 1 tablesp each allspice and cloves and 2 
tablesp fcinnamon. Cook until thick, stirring often to prevent 
scorching, and seal while hot. — [Mrs. W. G., Mo. 

To Can Dandelion or Other Greens 

Pick the dandelion greens before they are in bud or blossom, 
digging down deep for them. Discard all the tough leaves and 
buds, wash and rinse thoroughly, and cook until tender in 
salted water. Then drain and pack into the cans while hot, 
and fill with clear, boiling hot water, and then screw on covers 
loosely. Be sure that there are no air spaces or air bubbles 
left in the cans. Place the cans in a boiler of water, proceed- 
ing in the usual manner, and boil for 15 minutes, after which 
seal tight. Beet, mustard, spinach and other greens can be 
canned in the same way. — [B. F. H., Me. 



Cherries should be washed well several times to remove that 
strong taste so common to cherry preserves. — [Mrs. M. M. B., 
Mo. 

Mulberries will not keep if canned alone. They should be 
combined with gooseberries, or with the juice of rhubarb. — r 
[E. H., 111. 

The best apples for preserving are the old-fashioned "sweet- 
ing," as they will not boil to pieces like tart apples. They 
require the same proportions and treatment as the peach. — <

Jellies, Jams and Marmalades 

Y the time winter sets in, jellies, jams and 
marmalades are in great demand, and it 
therefore behooves the careful housewife 
to put up a goodly supply of these delec- 
table sweets. When made at home from 
good material, by the following recipes, 
they will prove to be as palatable as they are wholesome. 
For jellies, fruit not yet fully ripe is best, and for jams, 
marmalades or "butters'' (which are almost identical in 
composition), fully ripe fruit m^ay be used and such that 
are not perfect enough for canning whole, but are never- 
theless all right for cutting up and boiling down with 
sugar. It is a waste of time and sugar to try to use fruit 
that is not good — therefore, don't. 

Some Jelly Rules 

The principal rules governing jelly making from fruit, 
applicable to almost all kinds of berries and fruits, are as 
follows: Berries or fruit should not be too ripe. They are in 
the best state just before ripening. Use only sound fruit, 
pick over carefully, wash and drain, mash, and put over a 
slow fire to extract the juices. In the case of very juicy 
fruit, water need not be added, and for others a very little 
water will do — just enough to prevent burning. When done 
and the juices run freely from the fruit, turn into a jelly bag 
and let drain all night. Do not squeeze the bag to extract 
the juice, unless the recipe especially calls for such a proceed- 
ing, as otherwise the juice will become cloudy. The pulp 
that remains can often be used for jams or marmalades or 
pies, with the addition of sugar and spices. 

In the morning measure the juice, and then measure out 
the same quantity of sugar, or a little less in the case of 
naturally sweet fruit. Put the sugar in the oven to heat, 
but be careful not to let it burn. Put the juice over the 
fire in a granite or porcelain-lined kettle kept strictly for 
such purposes, and allow it to boil briskly from 15 to 20 
minutes. Then add the hot sugar, stir until dissolved, and 
boil 5 to 10 minutes longer. Test, and remove from the 
fire as soon as it is ready to "jell." Pour at once into clean, 

201

warm, dry glasses, placed on a folded towel wrung out of 
liot water, cover with mosquito netting, and let get cold. 
The next morning cover the top of the jelly in each glass 
with fitted rounds of white paper dipped in brandy or alcohol, 
and either pour over a layer of melted paraffine, or cover with 
several layers of paper, securely tied down over the sides of 
the glasses. Set away in a cool, dry and dark place. — [A. G., 
Mass. 

About Preserving Kettles and Jelly Bags 

Never use a kettle in which meats, vegetables, pickles, etc., 
have been cooked, for canning or sweet preserving, no matter 
how carefully you may clean it. It will always retain some of 
the old cooking flavor and mar the preserve products. It is 
economy to keep one or more good granite or porcelain-lined 
kettles specially for jellies, jams and marmalades. Clean at 
once after each using, and do not be content with the ordinary 
washing, but fill with hot water, add a teasp of baking 
soda, and let stand a while to sweeten the kettle, and also 
to remove fruit discolorations. Never use rough scouring 
soap to clean the inside of a preserving kettle, as that would 
ruin the enamel and cause the contents to burn so much more 

Jelly bags are best made of cheese cloth, of one or two 
thicknesses. Some cooks prefer flannel, claiming that the 
juice will come through this clearer. If the jelly bags are 
made in pointed, oval shape, about 12 inches wide (double) 
on top and tapering down to 3 or 4 inches at the bottom, 
that will be found to be much more convenient and satis- 
factory. A cheap wire extension arm used for hanging up 
bird cages is a great convenience in the kitchen in preserving 
time. The jelly bag can be hung up on this, and the drip 
vessel placed on a chair directly beneath. If flies or gnats 
are plentiful, envelop the bag, bowl and chair with a mosquito 
netting. — [A. G., Mass. 

Spiced Apple Jelly 

For % pk sour apples allow 2 pts vinegar, 1 pt water, 
iy2 ozs stick cinnamon, and 1 oz whole cloves. Boil all 
together, and drain through a jelly bag over night. For 
every pt juice allow 1 lb sugar, and boil until it jellies. This 
is nice served with meat. — [Mrs. H. J. T., Vt. 

Apple Jelly 

Wipe the apples carefully, remove stem and blossom ends, 
cut out affected parts, and cut in quarters, discarding all 
wormy apples. Put over the fire in a preserving kettle with 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 203 

cold water to half cover. Cook slowly until the apples are 
soft. If a few elderberries or blackberries are cooked with 
the apples the color will be much improved. Strain through 
jelly bag over night. Next morning measure juice and for 
each cup allow % cup sugar. Set sugar in oven, bcii the 
juice 20 minutes, add hot sugar, boil 5 minutes longer, and 
then turn into jelly glasses. — [Mrs. C. J. H., Vt. 

Apple and Grape Jelly 

Cook grapes and apples separately until soft, then drain 
in separate bags over night. To 1 part grape juice add 2 
parts apple juice, and allow two-thirds as much sugar as you 
have combined juice (measured before boiling). Add sugar 
hot to juice, after it has boiled 20 minutes, and let boil a few 
minutes longer, or until it is ready to "jell." — [Mrs. J. J. C, 
Mich. 

Quince Jelly 

This may be made of parings, if a little of the whole 
fruit is added, but all seeds must be removed, and blossom 
and stem ends. Almost cover with cold water, cook until 
very soft, then strain through a jelly bag over night. Allow 
% pt sugar to 1 pt juice. Boil the juice from 15 to 20 
minutes, skim, and then add sugar which should have been 
thoroughly heated in oven. Let boil up a few minutes, and 
then turn into glasses. One-half quince and one-half apple 
makes a very nice jelly. — [Mrs. J. L. R., O. 

Red Currant Jelly 

Select not too ripe currants, pick over carefully, put them 
in a preserving kettle, and let stand on back of range until 
juices draw. Stir occasionally until skins are broken, and 
then pour into jelly bag and let drain over night. To each 
pt juice allow 1 pt sugar. Put sugar in oven to heat, put 
juice over fire, and boil and skim 20 minutes, then add hot 
sugar, until melted, and let boil up again a few minutes, 
after which remove from fire and fill at once into jelly 
glasses. Let them stand in the sun as long as possible that 
day, but be careful to cover the glasses with a netting to 
prevent any flies from falling in. Jelly made by this formula 
will be clear, and have that sparkle so much admired and 
desired. Other berry or fruit jellies can be made in the 
same manner. — [L. E. B., Ind. 

Black Currant Jelly 

Boil black currants in almost as much water as you have 
fruit. Drain in jelly bag over night, and for each qt juice 
allow 1 pt sugar. Boil 3 hours. Black currant needs longer 
boiling then other jellies. — [Mrs. A. L. C, Okla. 



204 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Grape Jelly 

Use grapes that are just beginning to ripen, but not quite 
ripe. Pick, wash and boil slowly with a very little water 
about 15 minutes. Strain through jelly bag over night, 
then heat juice to boiling point, add an equal quantity of 
sugar, thoroughly heated in oven, and boil briskly about 5 
minutes, and then turn at once into jelly glasses. Green 
grape jelly can also be made by this recipe.- — [R. M. P., Mass. 

Green Grape Jelly 

Wash and pick over grapes carefully, partly cover with 
water, and let boil until soft, stirring and mashing while 
they are cooking. Turn into jelly bag and let drain over 
night, then boil juice 20 minutes, skim, and to each pt juice 
(measured before boiling) allow 1 lb sugar, heated in the 
oven. Let boil up a few minutes, and then turn into jelly 
glasses. — [No Name. 

Cranberry Jelly 

Use not too ripe red berries. Pick over carefully and wash 
and drain. To 2 qts berries allow 1 scant pt cold water, boil 
briskly about 15 minutes, then turn into a jelly bag and drain 
over night. In the morning bring the juice to a boil, add 
2 lbs sugar, which has been thoroughly heated in the oven, 
and boil all together about 20 minutes, stirring constantly. — • 
[M. B., 111. 

Elderberry Jelly 

Put the elderberries over the fire with barely enough water 
to cover, and when done turn them into a jelly bag and drain 
over night. When making elderberry jelly I always squeeze 
the jelly bag to get out the good clear juice. Measure the 
juice and for each pt allow 1 lb sugar. Bring the juice 
to a boil, and then boil 2 minutes, add the sugar which 
should have been heated thoroughly in the oven, let it boil 
up thoroughly once more, and pour into jars. This will not 
get solid like other jellies. We like to eat it with pancakes 
in the winter. — [Mrs. E. B., N. Y. 

Barberry Jelly 

Boil together until soft 4 qts barberries and 12 large, sour 
apples, adding no more water than necessary. Let drain over 
night, and for each pt juice allow 1 pt sugar. Put juice over 
fire with juice of 3 oranges, a little of the thin orange peel, 
(but none of the white part) and Vz lb seedless raisins. Boil 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 205 



until orange peel and raisins are soft, then carefully skim 
tiiese out, add the sugar, which should first have been 
thoroughly heated in the oven, and boil about 15 minutes. — ■ 
[Mrs. W. H. M., Mass. 

Gooseberry Jelly 

Carefully pick and wash the gooseberries, and to each pt 
allow % pt water. Simmer until berries are all broken, then 
turn into jelly bag and let drain over night. Measure juice 
and boil briskly about 15 minutes, then stir in an equal 
amount heated sugar, and boii steadily about % hour. — 
[L. E. B., Ind. 

Raspberry or Blackberry Jelly 

Pick berries over carefully, wash and drain, and put over 
fire with just enough water to keep from burning. Stir and 
mash while cooking, and when well done, turn into jelly 
bag and let drain over night. Do not squeeze the bag if you 
want nice, clear jelly. Boil and skim juice about 10 minutes, 
then measure, and for each pt juice allow 1 pt sugar. Heat 
sugar and add it to the boiling juice. Boil about 15 or 20 
minutes, or until it is ready to "jell." — [Mrs. A. C, Va. 

Cherry Jelly 

Sour cherries, not too ripe, are best. Wash and drain, add 
a very little v^ater, and let simmer slowly i/^ hour, then turn into 
jelly bag, and let drain all night. For 2 cups juice allow iy2 
cups sugar. Bring juice to boiling point, boil 20 minutes, then 
add sugar, which should have been thoroughly heated in the 
oven, boil up briskly for another few minutes, and turn at 
once into jelly glasses. The jelly w^ill be firmer if 14 part 
currant juice is added to the cherry juice. — [Mrs. O. M. 
P., N. H. 

Plum Jelly 

Choose plums that are not too ripe and put over fire with 
water enough to half cover. Boil until soft, turn into jelly 
bag and let drain over night. Measure juice, add an equal 
amount sugar, and boil and skim. "When it is ready to "jell," 
which will be when it is thick enough to drop slowly from a 
spoon, turn at once into jelly glasses. — [Mrs, F. M. C, Tex. 

Strawberry Jelly 

Use only fine colored, fresh berries; pick over carefully, 
wash and drain, and put in a porcelain-lined kettle on back 



206 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



of range to draw juices. Stir and mash with a wooden spoon. 
When juice runs freely, turn berries into jelly bag and let 
drain over night. Allow 1 lb sugar for each pt juice. Let 
juice boil about 15 minutes, then add heated sugar, and boil 
10 minutes longer. The left-over pulp can be used for jam. — 
[F. L., Wis. 

Rhubarb Jelly 

To 4 qts rhubarb cut in small pieces, but not peeled, add 
about V2 or % qt washed cherry leaves, about 1 pt fresh 
water, and cook slowly until rhubarb is tender. Strain through 
a jelly bag over night. For each pt juice allow 1 pt sugar. 
Bring juice to a quick boil, boil about 20 minutes, skim, 
and then add sugar, which should have been previously heated 
in the oven. Boil briskly another 5 minutes, and then turn 
at once into jelly glasses. Instead of cherry leaves, orange 
juice can be used as a flavoring. The cherry leaves will im- 
part to the rhubarb a delicious flavor of cherries. — [Mrs. W. 
V. L., Me. 

Tomato Jelly 

Wash, drain and cut in halves 4 qts yellow tomatoes. Boil 
until soft, then turn into jelly bag and let drain over night. 
Allow Vz cup granulated sugar for each cup juice. Let juice 
boil 20 minutes, then turn in the sugar, heated, and boil 
about 15 minutes longer. I allow 1 slice lemon, pits removed, 
to every qt juice, and skim lemon out just before turning 
jelly into glasses. — [Mrs. G. W. A., Pa. 

Rules for Preparing Jams and Marmalades 

Fully ripe fruit or berries can be used for jams, but it will 
not pay to use over-ripe fruit. Berries should be carefully 
picked over, washed and drained and put on the back of the 
stove in an agate or porcelain-lined kettle with % or % 
the amount of sugar. Stir and when the sugar is melted, 
bring the kettle to the front of the stove and let the jam 
boil until it begins to thicken, which will be from 20 to 30 
minutes. Stir frequently to prevent burning and skim off 
all skum that rises to the surface. Apples, peaches, pears, 
etc., should be peeled, cored and quartered and if the fruit 
is not juicy enough, add a very little water. Jams may be 
put up the same as jellies, in glasses or jars, and no air- 
tight sealing is necessary, a layer of melted paraffine and a 
cover of paper being suflicient. Set away in a cool, dark and 
dry place. — [A. G., Mass. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 207 



Cherry Jam 

Stone S lbs cherries, stir in 2 lbs sugar, let stand 10 or 
12 hours, then boil slowly until converted into a smooth 
jam. — [E. K., Mass. 

Strawberry Jam 

Hull, wash and drain the berries, mash, add an equal 
quantity sugar or a little less sugar if very sweet jams are 
not liked, put over a slow fire, bring to the boiling point 
and boil about 20 minutes. Test by taking out a teaspoonful 
on a saucer, and if the liquid does not jelly when cool, boil 
a little longer. About % part currants added to the straw- 
berries is a great improvement. — [A. G., Mass. 

Raspberry and Blackberry Jam 

To each lb berries add % lb sugar, and if berries are not 
juicy enough, a very little water. I always add some currants 
to raspberry jam as they provide just the necessary acidy 
flavor. Some people like a little cinnamon flavoring. Boil 
until it thickens and the juice is ready to jelly. Put away 
in glasses or jars and seal with paraffine. — [A. G., Mass. 

Rhubarb Jam 

To 2% lbs rhubarb, cut in small pieces, add 2 lbs sugar, 
1 cup vinegar, 1 teasp cinnamon and Vq teasp cloves. Boil 
about Vz hour and when thick pour in glasses and seal with 
paraffine. — [A. McL., 111. 

Wild Cherry and Grape Jam 

Boil 2 gals wild cherries with barely enough water to 
cover them, until they are soft enough to rub through a sieve. 
In another vessel boil 1 gal green grapes the same way, and 
afterwards combine the pulp of the two with V2 as much 
sugar as pulp, and boil together about 2 hours. — [Mrs. J, 
K., Neb. 

Cold Currant Jam 

Stir well together equal parts mashed currants and granu- 
lated sugar, let stand over night, then stir up again and 
pour into glass jars, seal, and keep in a cool place. Be sure 
every currant is mashed. This is nice to serve with roast 
meats.— [Mrs. D. J. C. N. Y.

Use gooseberries that are not too ripe, place a layer in an 
earthern or granite-ware vessel, cover with sugar, put in 
another layer of gooseberries, cover with sugar again, and so 
on until the pan is almost filled. Then add 1 pt w^ater to every 
6 lbs gooseberries, place in a moderately heated oven, and 
leave it there till the sugar is converted into a syrup and the 
contents begin to boil. Put up in small jars, not forgetting 
to pour a fine sheet of paraffine over the top, which will 
prevent moulding. — [P. L. B. R., Ct. 

Tomato Jam 

To 4 lbs peeled and sliced ripe tomatoes, add 2 lbs sugar, 
1 pt vinegar and salt, cinnamon and cloves to taste. Cook 
till thick, like fruit jam. — [Mrs. J. B. M., N. Y. 

Rhubarb and Raspberry Jam 

Peel and cut rhubarb in small pieces and for each lb allow 
1 lb raspberries and 2 lbs sugar. Boil together slowly and

plate. Strawberries and rhubarb may be combined in the 
same way. — [Mrs. N. M. P., N. H. 

Damson Jam 

Allov/ "A lb sugar for each lb fruit. Wash fruit and boil 
with just enough water to prevent scorching. When soft 
press through a colander, then return the pulp to the kettle, 
add the sugar and a few blanched kernels of the plums. Boil 
gently until the consistency of jelly, skimming off the skum. 
After it has cooled off a little, pour into small earthern jam 
pots, jelly glasses or jars. Damson jam is an excellent side 
dish to serve with meats, game or poultry. — [O. M. P., N. H- 

Baked Peach Jam 

Use ripe, perfect fruit, pare and remove the stones, mash 
as fine as possible, turn into an earthernware or agate dish, 
place in a hot oven and cook for an hour or more. Then put 
in about half as much sugar as there is fruit and cook 1 
or 2 hours longer, or until the consistency of jam. — [J. L. 
R., O. 

Apricot Jam 

Select good, ripe fruit and to every lb, after peeling and 
stoning, allow % ib sugar. Crack a few of the stones, take

Cherry Marmalade 

Remove stones from cherries, crush the stones, put in a 
Tiettle with a small quantity of water, and boil until the 
flavor is extracted. Put fruit in a preserving kettle, add 
a little clear water and boil until reduced to a pulp, stirring 
frequently with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking. For 
each lb fruit allow % lb sugar and add sugar to the strained 
water in which the stones have been cooked and boil until 
transparent bubbles appear en top. Pour this syrup over the 
fruit and continue boiling and stirring until thick and smooth. 
— [A. G., Mass. 

Orange Marmalade 

Boil the thin yellow peel (none of the white rind) of 1 doz 
ripe oranges in just enough water to cover. When tender, drain 
off the water and chop the peel in fine pieces. Peel the oranges, 
pull to pieces, and discard all the white parts, fibre and seeds, 
and add 1 cup sugar to each cup orange pulp. Let this 
stand until the sugar is dissolved, stirring frequently, then 
add the boiled and chopped orange peel and boil all together 
about 20 minutes. If the oranges are not tart, the juice of 
1 lemon may be added. — [Mrs. H. L., Va. 

Quince Marmalade 

"The fruit should be quite ripe. Peel, quarter and core, and 
cook until soft in a very little water, then rub through a 
sieve, weigh the pulp, add an equal weight of sugar, and boil 
slowly until of the proper consistency. — [Mrs. A. C. McP., O.

THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 211 



Plum Butter 

Wash, put into a kettle, cover with water, boil until thor- 
oughly cooked, then let cool, and rub through sieve or 
colander. A medium sized muskmelon added to every 2 
qts of plums greatly improves the flavor, but may be omitted. 
For each lb fruit pulp, allow V2 lb sugar. Boil gently about 
3 hours. Skim well and stir often. Put into glass jars 
and seal tight. — [Mrs. W. S., Neb.

pieces and stew in a very little water until soft, then add 
V2 as much sugar and spices to suit taste, and boil down until 
very dark or until it cannot boil any longer without sticking, 
stirring constantly. Put up boiling hot in fruit jars. Squash 
butter is made the same way. To dry pumpkin, stew until 
soft in as little water as possible, then mash fine, adding 1 
tablesp sugar or molasses to each pt pumpkin, and stew slowly 
until it is almost dry. Spread about 1 inch thick on greased 
pans and place in a moderate oven till thoroughly dry, turn- 
ing around when necessary. After it is dry and cold put up 
in paper bags and hang in a dry place. Soak pieces of this 
in a little water over night when wanted for pies. — [Mrs. J.

Crabapple Jumble 

To 7 lbs crabapples, quartered and cored, but not pared, 
add 1 lb sugar, 2 lbs seeded raisins, and yellow peel and pulp 
of 2 oranges, discarding seeds and white parts. Cook all 
together with just enough water to dissolve sugar. When 
done it should be of a thick, honey-like consistency, and a 
clear, reddish amber in color. This will make about 1 gal 
and will keep indefinitely, sealed in a jar. — [Mrs. E. G. P.r

and simmer slowly % hour in 1 cup water. Then add to the 
spiced water 7 lbs cranberries, Zy2 lbs sugar and 2 cups cider 
vinegar. Cook slowly until as thick as marmalade. Pour 
into glasses and when perfectly cool, seal with melted paraf- 
fine, or cover securely with paper. — [N. M. P., N. H. 

Quince Honey 

Peel and grate 3 or 4 good sized, ripe and juicy quinces, 
and add to a briskly boiling syrup made of 3 pts sugar and 
1 pt water. Boil 20 minutes after the quince has been added. 
As quick as the quinces are grated, turn them into the 
syrup. Allow the kettle to stand on the back of the stove 
until all are in. — £Mrs. D. A. F., Pa. 

Fig Paste 

"Wash and cut fine 1 lb figs, add 1 qt cold water, bring slowly 
to the boiling point, and then cook slowly 1 hour. Next add 
3 cups sugar, and cook until it thickens like jelly when a little 
of it is cooled. Settle in jelly glasses. This is very nice to 
eat with warm biscuits, or for layer cake, and is excellent 
to make sweet sandwiches for the children's lunch. — [Mrs. 
J. D., N. Y. 



It is best not to try to make large quantities of jellies or 
jams at one time. When made in small quantities — a quart or 
two at a time— they turn out much better. — [A. G., Mass. 

A little lemon juice added to blackberry jam when it is 
boiling improves the flavor. — [No name. 

If you object to the raspberry and blackberry seeds in jam, 
run them through a fine wire sieve after boiling the berries 
until soft, and before adding the sugar. — [A. G., Mass. 

By adding V4, apple pulp to % blackberry pulp, a nice jelly 
of improvsd flavor is obtained. — [A. G., Mass. 

For strawberry jam, I use the following proportions: 4 lbs 
strawberries, 2 lbs sugar, 1 pt currant juice. — [L. E. B., Ind.

Picklin^^^Soup and Sweet 

VERY housewife who can procure or has 
at her disposal the necessary ingredients, 
is, or should be, interested in pickling 
recipes, since pungent and spicy relishes are 
generally considered necessary adjuncts to 
a well equipped table. They can be made 
at home at small expense and with httle trouble and 
expenditure of time. The bulk of pickling is done in the 
cooler months of fall, and if only therefor alone, the work 
is or would seem to be much less laborious than the can- 
ning and preserving, which must be done during the warm 
summer season, when most of the fruit ripens. When the 
directions call for air-tight sealing, the usual canning pre- 
cautions should be carefully observed. Good vinegar, sugar 
and spices are as necessary to success as good fruit and 
vegetables, for however fine the latter may be, if the former 
are of an inferior quality, the finished product w411 be most 
unsatisfactory. Among the following are a choice variety 
of pickling recipes, sour, sweet and spicy, which can be 
varied or modified to suit individual tastes. 

To Salt Down Cucumbers For Pickles 

Have ready a perfectly clean jar, crock, or keg — whether 
the receptacle is glass, stone, or wood is immaterial, as long 
as it is clean and does not leak. Use only good, firm cucum- 
bers, not too large, and cut them from the vines with a pair 
of sharp scissors, leaving about % inch stem on each. Never 
pull them from the vines, and always handle them carefully 
so as not to bruise them. Wash clean and wipe dry. Put a 
2 or 3-inch layer of coarse salt in the bottom of the keg, then 
a layer of closely packed cucumbers, cover with salt, and pro- 
ceed in this way until all the cucumbers are used, topping off 
with a layer of salt, and over that a layer of freshly picked 
grape leaves. Use plenty salt — there is more danger in using 
too little than too much. Pour in cold, hard water to cover, 
put a clean white cloth over the top, tucking in the edges 
snugly down the sides, then put in an inverted plate, or a 
hard board to fit, and weigh it down with a large, clean stone,

to keep the cucumbers well under brine. Cover the keg and 
set away in a cool place. Cucumbers may be added from time 
to time as they are gathered, with some more salt, until the 
crock is full. Be careful to keep the cucumbers always well 
under the brine, and if there should be too much brine, throw 
some of it away. When removing cloth, plate, and stone, do 
so carefully, and if any scum has gathered, wash thoroughly 
before returning to the crock. When the pickles are wanted 
for table use, take out enough to last about one week, freshen 
them in clear, cold ■\rater baths, until they are plump and just 
right to the taste, changing the water frequently and tasting 
a pickle occasionally to see if it is too salty. The pickles are 
then ready to be put in cold vinegar with any preferred spices, 
and in about 10 hours or less they will be ready for use. A 
small bunch of dill put in the vinegar imparts a delightful 
flavor. Cover the jar, and set in a cool place. — [A. G., Mass. 

To Salt Down String Beans 

Select firm, meaty, juicy and tender beans. Wash and drain, 
string and break or cut up in small pieces. If the beans are 
large and meaty, and cut up fine, on the bias, the result will 
be much more satisfactory. Pack the beans into a crock in 
alternate layers with salt, beginning and topping off with a 
layer of salt. Keep in a moderately warm place so the salt will 
dissolve and form a brine, which should cover the beans well. 
Beans and salt may be added from day to day until the jar is 
full. Then cover inside with a clean cloth, plate or board and 
weight down with a clean stone. Be sure that the brine covers 
the beans. Cover the crock, tie over with cloth or paper, and 
set away in a cool place. — [E. R. G., R. I. 

To Salt Down Whole Ripe Tomatoes 

Ripe and perfectly sound tomatoes may be kept for winter 
use by simply packing them carefully in large stone jars and 
pouring over them a very strong brine. Cover tight to keep 
out the air. When wanted for use, take out the required 
number of tomatoes and soak them 24 hours in cold water. 
They can then be peeled and sliced, and will taste as though 
they had just come from the vines. — [Mrs. E. L., Mass.

Cucumber Pickles IV 

Cui cucumbers from vines with sharp scissors, when about 

2 or 3 inches long, allowing about % inch stem to remain on 
each. For 1 pk cucumbers allow 1 cup coarse salt and make 
a brine sufficient to cover the cucumbers, and pour it over 
them boiling hot. Let stand for a day, drain off, and repeat 
this twice, using new brine each time, and allowing 24 hours 
between each change. On the fourth day drain off the brine, 
pour over clear, boiling water, and let stand 24 hours; then 
drain and pack the cucumbers in jars, sprinkling among them 
some whole cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and any other spices 
liked, and to each gallon jar of pickles add a piece of alum 
the size of a small hazelnut. Pour over hot vinegar to cover 
and when cold, cover the top with horseradish leaves. The 
pickles must always be kept well under the vinegar. For 
sweet pickles melt 1 cup sugar in each qt vinegar. — [Mrs. G., 
Wis. 

Dill Pickles 

Wash sound, medium sized pickles and put them to soak 
over night in a brine made of 1 cup salt to 2 gals water. Next 
morning wipe the cucumbers dry, put a layer in a jar, then a 
layer of freshly gathered grape leaves, another layer of 
cherry leaves and one of dill, then another layer of cucum- 
bers, and so on until the jar is full. Cover with a fresh brine 
prepared the same as directed above, cover with a cloth, 
weight down with a board and stone, so that the cucumbers 
will be well covered with the brine, cover the jar, and set away 
in a cool place. — [M. S. L., Wis.

Green Tomato Pickle 

Green tomatoes are the most used and the most abused 
for pickling. Many soak them all night in salt water, which 
toughens them, and as a consequence green tomato pickle 
is not a favorite. Green tomato pickle as I prepare it may not 
look so fancy as some other pickles, but it tastes good, and 
that is the most important consideration. I put the tomatoes 
and other ingredients all together, and cook until the tomatoes 
are tender, and seal while the mixture is boiling hot. In this 
way there is no tiresome soaking in brine, draining, reboil- 
ing, etc. One can put up a big lot in the morning and have 
it done ready to put away before dinner. In the first place, 
do not use undersized, very green tomatoes, but select those 
that are full grown and green, almost ready to ripen. 

Slice 1 gal green tomatoes without peeling, but cut out the 
hard stem ends. Core, peel and slice 6 good sized onions 
(white onions are best), add 1 pt best cider vinegar, 1 pt sugar 
(white or brown), 1 tablesp each salt, ground mustard, whole 
black pepper and white mustard seed, i^ tablesp whole all- 
spice, and 1 heaping teasp whole cloves. Mix well together and 
then stew until tender, stirring often to prevent burning. If 
one wishes a hot or extra peppery taste, add ^ teasp red pep- 
per, or one red pepper pod cut up in small pieces, with the 
seeds taken out. This pickle may be boiled until tender and 
each slice of tomato retain its shape. There will be plenty 
of rich juice without adding water, but if it should become 
too dry before boiled tender, add a very little hot water. Put 
up in glass jars and seal. The above given quantities will 
make about 4 or 5 qts of pickle. Set away in a cool, dark 
and dry place. This same recipe may be used for ripe toma- 
toes, or half ripe ones. — [1. C. T.. Ind.

place and from day to day drop in carefully selected small 
yellow tomatoes, first pricking each tomato with a fork, to 
keep them from bursting. When jar is full, cover with a

Sauerkraut 

Cabbage in the form of kraut, if properly made and cared 
for, is nutritious and makes a desirable dish, being convenient 
and very little trouble to prepare. I have been using the follow- 
ing recipe for years and have never lost a pound or had any 
trouble with mouldy cloths on top of kraut. For large quanti- 
ties I use clean oak barrels, for a few gallons I prefer stone' 
jars. For packing in barrels, I place the barrel near the wall 
of a building or a heavy post, make a follower that will just fit 
inside of the barrel and press down by means of a lever, one end 
in a crack of the building or under a block nailed to a post. 
Pack in solid, but do not pound or stamp, as this breaks and 
mashes the fiber of the leaves and causes them to become dark. 
The way I want kraut to look when taken from the barrel is 
long, stringy and of a snowy whiteness, and to have a sour, not 
a soured taste and smell. 

Early morning, when the dew is on, is the best time to 
gather cabbage for kraut. The weather should be warm enough 
to cause fermentation to take place in 2 or 3 days from time of 
packing. After fermentation has ceased, keep in a shady cool 
place. Remove all outside leaves and the heart or stalk of the 
cabbage. Use a two or three-knife kraut cutter, place over a 
tub, and shred the required amount to fill barrel or jars. Use 
1 tablesp salt to each gal of kraut, and no more, for if more salt 
is used fermentation will not be so perfect — the salt will pre- 
serve, instead of allowing the cabbage to ferment. Sprinkle 
salt over the cut cabbage and thoroughly mix by working over 
with the hands or a large wooden spoon or paddle. Do not use 
any metal spoons or kettles, Yfter mixing, press in the barrels 
or jars very solid. If in barrels replace the head and bore m 
it an inch auger hole, set level, and pour in cold water until it 
will take no more. Keep the head of barrel covered with water 
by adding more every day, or as needed. After fermentation 
has ceased, stop up tight and keep head of barrel covered with 
water, to exclude the air. If put up in jars, keep a weight on to 
hold kraut under brine, and keep it running over with water, 
to cause all skum to work off. — [J. W. G., Ky. 




Qatsups and Relishes 

AUCES and spiced relishes, in one shape 
or another, are to be found on almost every 
well equipped table, and while a too liberal 
indulgence in them is properly considered 
unwholesome, yet they fill a gastronomical 
want which is universal and therefore not 
to be overlooked. As almost all the ingredients except 
some of the spices and sugar are grown on the average 
=home farm, catsups and sauces can be prepared at com- 
paratively small expense by country housekeepers, while 
town and city dwellers must pay high prices for the raw 
material of an inferior quality, or buy the ready-made 
bottled relishes of whose purity they cannot be assured. In 
preparing homemade catsups and relishes it is imperative 
that the following rules be observed: Have the bottles 
thoroughly clean and drained dry. Be sure the corks are 
sound and clean, and allow them to soak a little while in 
hot water before using. See to it that the corks are large 
•enough, and press them into the bottles as far as they 
w^ill go. Then trim off the tops evenly with a sharp knife, 
and dip the top of each bottle to the depth of about one inch 
or more in a melted sealing mixture made of beeswax and 
rosin, in the proportion of one part rosin to two parts bees- 
wax, or dip the bottles into melted sealing wax the same 
as that used for sealing letters. Prepared paraffine or seal- 
ing wax cakes, ready for melting, can be bought in the 
stores. 

Ripe Tomato Catsup 

Wash and cut out the stem end of 1 pk good, ripe tomatoes. 
Cut up and boil until very soft, then rub through a colander 
first, and a fine sieve afterward. This will remove all the

or porcelain lined kettle, put over the fire and add the follow- 
ing: 2 tablesp salt, 1 tablesp each ground black pepper, 
ground cloves and celery seed, 1 teasp cayenne pepper and

cloth bag, and let the catsup boil about 6 hours, stirring 
occasionally until the last hour, then almost constantly to 
prevent burning. Pour into a stone jar, and let stand until 
perfectly cold, then add 1 pt good vinegar and remove the

Butchering Time Recipes 

ERHAPS there is no work which falls to 
the lot of housekeepers on our farms that 
is more dreaded or disliked by them than 
the yearly or semi-yearly jobs connected 
with butchering time, which the women 
must perform — the trimming, salting, cur- 
ing, pickling and smoking, and the rendering of fat. 
,Though fresh meat is rare in many farm homes most of 
the year,„ when butchering time comes, there is such a 
plethora of it that the appetite and appreciation for it 
decrease at a rapid rate. This is only natural, and it is 
therefore well to know how to preserve as much of it as 
possible, for use during those seasons when fresh meat, or 
meat of any kind 'besides poultry, is not so plentiful. A 
careful study of the following recipes will convince the 
economical and ambitious housewives that there need be 
very little, if any, waste at butchering time, and that there 
need be no monotony or lack of good meat "timber" in 
farm homes, where the farmers do their own butchering. 

How to Cut Up a Beef 

When killing a beef it is very essential to properly quarter 
and cut the carcass, in order that the good cuts may be sepa- 
rated from the poor. Figure I illustrates the ordinary method 
of cutting up a beef, now used by butchers. The following 
explanation of the various parts gives the names of these cuts 
and the common uses to which they are put: 

The hind quarter is divided into nine cuts as follows: No 1, 
choice roasts, the porter and sirloin steaks; 2, rump, used for 
steaks, stews and corned beef; 3, aitch-bone, used for boiling 
pieces, stews and pot roasts; 4, bullock or round steak, for 
roasts or boiling pieces; 5, bottom round, for boiling and stew- 
ing; 6, shin or leg, for soups and hashes; 7, thick flank, for 
stews, corned beef and boiling pieces; 8, veiny piece, for 
corned or dried beef; 9, thin flank, for corned beef and boiling. 

The fore quarter is divided into nine parts as follows: No 10, 
forerib, prime roasts and fine steaks; 11, middle ribs, prime 

233 



234 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

roasts; 12, chuck ribs, the second quality of roasts and steaks; 
13, brisket, for corned beef, soups, etc; 14, shoulder piece, for 
soups, mince meat, and hashes; 15-16, neck, for soup, mince 
meat, hash and bologna sausage; 17, shin or shank, for soups 
and stews; 18, cheek, for mince meat and sausage. 

The Chicago retail meat dealers have a somewhat different 
method of cutting up the animal, as shown in Fig II. The 



FIG I — COMMON CUTTING METHOD 




FIG II — CHICAGO RETAIL, METHOD 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 235 



parts as numbered on the sketch are: 1, neck; 2, chuck; 3, 
prime rib; 4, porterhouse; 5, sirloin; 6, rump; 7, round; 8 
plate; 9, flank; 10, shin; 11, shank. They cut a larger part 
of the animal in the portions 3, 4, and 5, which represent the 
higher priced cuts. — [F & H. 

About Pork Making 

Hog killing and pork making on the farm have become 
almost lost arts in these days of mammoth packing establish- 
ments which handle such enormous numbers of swine at all 
seasons of the year, says the editor of "Home Pork Making," 
published by the Orange Judd Company, New York and Chi- 
cago. Yet the progressive farmer of today should not only pro- 
vide his own fresh and cured pork for family use, but also 
should be able to supply at remunerative prices such persons 
in his neighborhood as appreciate the excellence and general 
merit or economy of homemade pork product. "Home Pork 
Making" is a complete guide for the farmer in all that pertains 
to hog slaughtering, curing, preserving and storing pork prod- 
uct, from scalding vat to kitchen table and dining room, 
including numerous prize recipes. 

The general appearance of the most choice pork is from an 
animal, the carcass of which will not weigh less than 50 lbs, 
and not more than 120 lbs, according to Voe, author of the 
"Market Assistant" published by Orange Judd Company, New 
York and Chicago. The skin should present a semi-transparent 
appearance, approaching white in color; the fat on the back 
should not be less than half inch thick, white and firm, and 
the lean should be of a pale reddish color, and juicy. The 
skin of the older animals is thicker and coarser, while the lean 
is of a darker color, but equally sweet, juicy and tender. By 
many, fresh pork is considered to be exceedingly unwholesome 
during the months of the year of high temperature. This, no 
doubt, to a great extent is true, the fatty, gross character of the 
flesh not being easily assimilated, when the animal economy of 
the human system requires less heating nourishment to the 
blood, and therefore requires less irritating food to the diges- 
tive organs. 

The carcass. of pork being intended for immediate use while 
in its first state, is hung by the foot of its right hind leg, then 
cut down through the skin of the center of the back from the 
tail to the neck, followed with the splitting down of the back 
bone through the line of the incision, dividing it into halves or 
Bides. These are again divided, after taking off the head, into 
quarters. The hind quarter is first divided by taking off the 
leg of pork and when intended for corning, should be kept in 
pickle 10 or 12 days before use. The loin of pork, if not too 
fat, is good for roasting and also furnishes fine pork chops and 



236 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



delicate pieces for corning. The fore quarter of pork if smail^ 
is often roasted wliole, after having the blade hone removed; 
If large, it is divided across the ribs, using the thin part or 
brisket of pork for corning, after taking off the hocks and feet. 
Figure I, which shows the pork carcass lying on a block or 
table, furnishes a good diagram for cutting. First separate the 
head from the carcass, then split the carcass through the back 
bone with a chopper, then with a sharp knife loosen the leaf 
and kidney fat and tear it away toward the leg, the kidney, of 
course, being brought away with it. Each side is then divided 
into its fore and hind quarters by leaving two ribs on each of 
the latter. The next cut loosens the tenderloin from where it 
is connected with the ham, when it is torn out upwards towarcj 




PIG I— PORK CARCASS ON A BLOCK 

the ribs or head. The hams are then removed, beginning at the 
tail side and cutting circularly to the flank, after sawing the 
small bone about half way and chopping or sawing off the feet. 
Next cut off the brisket of pork, which is usually corned. The 
chine of pork, without the back fat, is much used for chops, 
steaks or roasting, while some prefer this part for sausage 
meat. The back fat, on the loin, is also taken off in the same 
manner, when, the loin is prepared for either chops or roast- 
ing. 

Figure II represents the mode of cutting pork carcass for 
barreling. The same mode of cutting is here adapted, by sep- 
arting the head from the carcass, then splitting the carcass, 
cutting off the fresh hams and feet, tearing out the leaf and 
kidney fat, taking out the tenderloin — as previously shown. 
Then the head (10 and 3) is divided by cutting off the cheeks, 
beginning from the corner of the mouth, following the line 
towards 9 (see also Fig I, A B), and saw off the jawbone, 
which separates the cheeks from the plate ; then crack the bone 
of the under jaw between the front teeth and the cheeks, held 
together to hang up by. Next take off the shoulder by cutting 
straight across the side, as shown Fig I (D); then trim off the 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



237 



spare ribs, by cutting under the breast-bone, and so follow the 
ribs as far as the chine-bone, when the knife is continued on 
directly to the end of the long bones in the back, which leaves 
the shoulder about one thickness, and the spare-ribs (not too 
spare), with meat enough left on them to make a roast. Then 
trim the shoulder round (see 2), and saw off the feet, which 
forms the shoulder similar to a ham. The brisket and flanks 
are next cut off, then the ribs (5) and loin pieces (4) are cut 
In suitable sizes, when all are ready to salt, except that the 
trimmings and some other pieces can be used for sausages. 
The leaf fat and pieces of fat are rendered into lard, and the 
pate, etc, is used for head cheese.

The flesh of the hog, diseased when slaughtered, is exceed- 
ingly unwholesome, and is not fit to be used for any purpose. 
Certain diseases may be known by yellowish lumps or kernels 
distributed through the fat and lean, and the flesh having a 
heavy, dull appearance. 

By Way o^f Preparation 

The day before you butcher, sharpen the knives, prepare 
the table, and set down the dipping barrel half of its depth 
into the ground, tilting it toward the table. Now fix a pulley 



238 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

directly above, which should be used when dipping, and also 
when hanging the pork to cool. If the weather is not very 
cold, butcher in the evening, so as to allow the pork to cool 
quickly, but in cold weather begin early in the morning and 
have plenty of boiling water and everything else in readiness* 
£F & H. 

Cleaning and Separating the Entrails 

As soon as the entrails are removed from the carcass, carry 
them into the house, lay out on a table, and go to work 
swiftly, before they have a chance to get cold. Have ready 
several sharp little knives, plenty of clean cloths, and some 
twine. The table should be long and narrow, and tipped up 
slightly at one end, and the feet at the other end placed in 
a large tub, to catch the drip. Better still is a flat wooden 
flue, of the correct width and length, with a 6-inch strip nailed 
along each side. 

Carefully cut away all fat and throw into cold salt water, 
the leaf lard being put in a separate vessel. Put the heart, 
kidneys and liver in a separate vessel of salt water, being 
careful not to break the gall bag. If an ox, save the latter, 
as ox gall is good for many things. Clean the stomach and 
also put in salt water, and treat the casings the same. Waste 
can be fed to the chickens. If you should happen to cut into 
the intestines, quickly tie up with twine and clean away excre- 
ment. It is better for two people to go at this work, to finish 
before it gets cold. — [A. G., Mass. 

When Beef Is KiUed 

When the weather gets cold, and after the beef is butchered, 
we let it hang for 2 or 3 days in a cool place, and then cut it 
up. We cut quite a number of nice lean pieces without any 
bone in them, and put them in brine for 2 or 3 weeks, then 
take them out and wipe dry, and put each one into a little 
cheesecloth sack, and hang over the cook stove to dry. This 
makes our dried beef. This is the way we hang them up: 
We take two pieces of rope about 2 feet long, and double 
them and fasten the ends to the ceiling about 5 feet apart, 
letting the loops hang down. Then we take a long smooth 
stick, and fasten all the little cheesecloth sacks of beef on the 
stick, and put each end of the stick in the loops of rope. 

We use some of the beef to make several large crocks of 
mincemeat, as it will keep all winter in a cold place. The rest 
of the beef we corn. Be most particular about the barrel 
— never use a barrel that has been used for other purposes, 
or if beef has ever soured in it. Get a new barrel, (a good 
molasses barrel is best), and clean it well. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 239 



Cut all the large bone out of the meat and then pack the 
beef in the barrel tightly. Cover with a hardwood board that 
will lat down in the barrel, put a clean, heavy stone on it, and 
it is ready for the pickling brine, which we make as follows: 
To 2 gals water add 3 lbs salt, 1 lb sugar, 1 oz saltpeter, and 
2 tablesp baking soda. Make as many gallons as you need, 
adding the same ingredients to every 2 gals water. Put in 
a boiler, boil, skim well, and pour boiling hot over the beef. 
Be sure the brine covers the beef well — yes, more than covers 
it — as it will soak in the beef some. If you should ever need 
to add more brine, do not put it on hot — that is only done 
the first time. — [Farmer's Wife, Colo. 



To Pack Pork in Salt 

The pork should hang in a cool place over night. Be sure 
that all the animal heat is out of it. Cut the sides into strips 
crosswise. Cover the bottom of a perfectly clean barrel with 
clean, coarse salt, and then pack in the strips of pork closely, 
edgewise, with the rind next to the barrel. Then fill the crev- 
ices in between with salt, and cover the top of the layer with 
salt, and proceed in this way until the pork is all in, or the 
barrel is filled. Make a strong brine of salt and cold water, 
using so much salt that the water will not dissolve any more — ■ 
it should be strong enough to float an egg. Boil and skim this 
brine, and then pour it into the barrel over the pork, while 
boiling hot. Cover the pork with a round, hard piece of 
board, a little smaller than the barrel head, put a clean stone 
on it, heavy enough to keep it down under the brine, then 
cover the barrel and set away in a cool, dry place. If at any 
time the brine should froth or look red, it should be turned 
out, scalded and skimmed, and then poured over the meat 
again scalding hot. Never put cold brine on old pork. We 
have pickled our pork in this way for many years, and have 
never lost any. When wanted for use freshen the pork by 
letting it stand in warm water on the back of the stove about 
half hour. — [Mrs. E. E. J., Cal. 



To Pack Frozen Meat in Hay-Box 

Take a large, strong, tight, wooden dry goods box, line 
inside with several thicknesses of paper, pasting it in closely 
and overlapping the seams generously, then put a thick layer 
of hay or sawdust in the bottom of the box, and cover with 
paper. Freeze hams, spare ribs, shoulders, or any pieces of 
fresh pork, beef, or poultry that you wish to keep fresh for 
future use, and be sure that the freezing is most thorough. 



240 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

SO that each piece is frozen all the way through. Wrap each 
piece separately in several layers of clean, light brown paper, 
then pack a layer of these pieces in a box prepared as above, 
fill all the crevices between the pieces with fine hay, packing 
it in solidly, cover the layer of meat pieces with about 5 or 6 
inches of hay, then pack in more meat as directed above, and 
so on until all the frozen meat is stored, or the box is full, 
being careful to have plenty of hay all around the sides, and 
on the top. Next put on a tight cover of wood, also lined 
with paper inside, and throw some thick covering over the 
box, such as an old comforter, blanket, fur robe, or a piece 
of heavy carpet. The box, of course, should stand in a cold 
and dry place. Frozen meat packed in this way will remain 
frozen and sweet for months, and will even withstand quite a 
long thaw. — [Mrs. I. R. N., Me. 

Canning Meat, Poultry and Sansages 

Cut the meat or poultry in pieces of convenient size, trim 
carefully, and be sure they are sweet and clean. Boil until 
tender in enough water to cover, seasoning to taste, the same 
as for immediate use, and when all the meat is well done 
and tender, press a little at a time in hot glass fruit jars, 
then pour in a little of the hot gravy (which should first have 
been boiled down until it is almost ready to jelly when cold), 
until the gravy fills up all the vacant places around the meat, 
but not enough to cause the meat to float. Then press in 
another layer of meat and more gravy, and proceed in this 
way until the jar is filled up to within one inch of the top. 
Be very sure that there are no air spaces left in the cans. Then 
fill each can overflowing full with melted suet, and seal air 
tight, using new rubbers and observing all the usual canning 
precautions. Set the jars away in a permanent storage place, 
which should be cool, dark and dry, and do not move the cans 
after once setting away. The melted suet on top will harden, 
and moving the cans after the layer of suet has hardened is 
apt to break it. Sausages should be pricked and boiled in 
water until tender, and packed in jars the same as meat, with 
a layer of melted lard or suet on top. Everything wants to 
be boiling hot when canned, sealed air tight, and set away 
while hot. Great care must be taken to use only perfect, air- 
tight cans. This recipe for canning meat has been used in our 
family successfully for many years. — [Mrs. M. R., N. Y. 

Smoking Meat 

The smokehouse should be large enough and have enough 
ventilation to prevent the meat becoming overheated. It is 
best to have the fire outside, with a length of stovepipe to 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 241 



conduct tlie smoke into the house. Hard wood, such as maple 
or green hickory, smothered with sawdust of the same, are 
the best for smoking meat, and corncobs the next best. Wood 
with resin, as spruce or pine, gives a bad flavor to the meat. 
There is a low, prickly, evergreen shrub, bearing green ber- 
ries, that grows in some localities, and where this can be had 
it is nicer than anything else, giving the meat a delicious 
flavor. Meat to be smoked should be well washed, or scrubbed 
with a hand brush in tepid water, to prevent a crust of 
salt forming on the outside, or if very salt, soaked over night. 
It should hang and dry out a day before being put into the 
smokehouse, and then hung so no two pieces touch each 
other. The fire should be slow at first, to heat up the meat 
gradually, and meat should never be frozen when put in the 
smokehouse. In cold weather it is best to keep the fire going 
steadily until finished, or the meat will not smoke evenly, 
owing to the inside being too cold for the smoke to penetrate, 
after cooling. Thirty-six hours will smoke meat nicely, if 
the fire is kept going steadily, or in warm weather a fire built 
every other day for two weeks cures it nicely, keeping the 
ventilator screened and the house dark, to exclude flies. — 
[F & H. 

Keeping Smoked Meat 

If the meat can be kept away from flies, it will keep nicely 
in a cool, dry cellar, but if one fly can get at it, it must be 
otherwise protected. A good and easy way is to wrap in paper 
and then in muslin sacks, and bury in a grain bin, by this 
method keeping a uniform temperature and excluding insects. 
If this cannot be done, it will be absolutely safe if wrapped in 
paper and put in muslin sacks, and the sacks completely 
coated with either ordinary lime whitewash or "yellow wash," 
and hung up so they do not touch. The directions for "yel' 
low wash" are: 3 lbs barites, 4 lbs flour, Vs lb chrome yel- 
low, 1-6 lb glue. Make the day before using. Heat 1% gals 
water and add the flour, mixed to a smooth paste. Dissolve 
the chrome in 1 qt water and add it. Boil, stirring con- 
stantly, and adding barites slowly. Apply cold with a brush, 
and stir often while using. — [P & H. 

Smoking In a Box 

Take a large, light box, place hooks inside the top to hang 
the meat on, and have a hole made on the side to fit a stove- 
pipe. Then take an old discarded heater and fit the pipe 
to the box, with the stove outside the box. Have a lid or 
door on one side of the box, so you can look to the meat. 
Start a fire with a few dry cobs, fill partly with straw, and 



242 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



then with boughs of cedar. If kept up all day, the meat will 
be done by night. The meat should have been in brine for 
2 or 3 weeks, then hung up to dry a little, before smoking. 
When smoked, let hang in box until ready to put down. Wrap 
the pieces in cloths, put in a barrel, and cover with oats. 

A Barrel Smoker 

Screw 3 or 4 hooks in the inside of the bottom of a good 
clean, close and large barrel, and turn it over an iron vessel 
in which a few live coals have been placed, with corn cobs 
and hickory chips piled on top, to make a steady smoke. 
Hang the hams, shoulders or pieces on the hooks, but be care- 
ful not to crowd in too many, or the smoke cannot reach all 
parts. The smoking should be done slowly, evenly and 
steadily. A little ventilation is needed, or the fire will go 
out, but not enough to allow too much smoke to escape. — 
[A. G., Mass. 

Smoked Barrel for Bacon and Hams 

Put a few live coals in an iron kettle, cover with clean 
com cobs, turn a clean barrel over this kettle, and smoke 2 
hours at a time for 2 days. If smoked too long at a time, 
it would shrink the barrel. When thoroughly smoked, put a 
brine in the barrel made of 10 lbs salt, 8 ozs saltpeter and 
2y2 qts molasses, for every 100 lbs meat. Add water enough 
to cover the meat. Pack the meat in this brine and weight 
down. The smoked barrel will impart the smoked flavor to 
the meat. — [Miss G. A. P., N. H. 

Treating Hams After Smoking 

Have a boiler full of boiling water, dip the hams in, and 
let them remain 2 or 3 minutes, then remove, and cover 
Ihem with a thick paste made of flour, water and cayenne 
pepper. The paste should be red with the pepper. Hang 
the covered hams in the sun until the paste covering is dry. 
Then put in stout paper sacks, tie closely, and hang in a dark 
and cool place. — [Mrs. J. S. H., 111. 

To Keep Meat Without Smoking 

After the animal heat has gone out of the meat, pack the 
pieces away in dry salt 4 weeks, after which dip each piece 
in a very strong solution of boiling hot salt water, dry oft 
and rub thoroughly with borax and black pepper. — [Mrs. M. 
G. P.. I. T. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 243 



To Di-y Sugar Oiu'e Meat 

For 400 lbs meat allow 10 lbs salt, l*/^ lbs each black 
pepper and brown sugar, and 4 ozs saltpeter. Mix well 
together and rub each piece of meat well with this mixture, 
using the hands, about 5 or 10 minutes. Do not pile up the 
pieces of meat, but lay them out on a board or table, skim 
side down, in a cool place, but not cold enough to freeze. 
Let them stay there 4 to 6 weeks, after which they will be 
ready to smoke. After smoking wrap them in clean, sweet 
hay then put them in muslin sacks, and hang in a cool, dark 
place. — [Mrs. A. W., Mo. 

Dry Cured Pork 

For each 100 lbs pork use 5 lbs salt, 2 lbs sugar and 2 ozs 
saltpeter. Mix well and divide into three parts. Rub the 
meat thoroughly with a third of the mixture at intervals of 
3 days, packing very closely in the barrel, and reversing 
the order of the pieces at each rubbing. If there is a good 
deal of meat, it is easier to have two barrels, putting the meat 
into one, as it is taken from the other, and pouring over the 
little liquid, if any forms. After the last rubbing let it lie for 
10 days in the barrel, when it will be cured and ready for 
smoking. While curing, the meat must be kept in a cool and 
moist place, and unless it can be, it is best to use the brine 
method. — [F & H. 

Salt Cured Pork 

Heat salt in a baking pan in the oven, until it is thoroughly 
hot, then rub it in the fleshy side of the meat with a large 
flat spoon, as it will be too hot to apply with the hand. Rub 
all on that will stick to the meat — for large hams two applica- 
tions will be necessary. This does not harden the lean meat, 
as brine does. Be sure to keep the salt hot. I have cured 
meat in this way in hot weather, and never lost any — the 
salt strikes in so quickly that it cannot spoil. — [Farmer's 
Wife, Col. 

The Barrel for Pickling or Curing 

It is most important that the barrel for pickling meat 
should be absolutely clean. First scald and scrape the barrel 
thoroughly, then set into the barrel a vessel containing a small 
lump of quicklime, pour a pail of boiling hot water over the 
lime, cover the barrel, and let the fumes of the slacking lime 
sweeten it. After this wash the barrel again, then put in a 
generous armful of new sweet hay, paur over plenty boiling 



244 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

water, cover closely, and leave until cold. After this, thor- 
oughly rinse the barrel again with fresh water, and if any 
bad odor remains, the case is hopeless and a new barrel an 
unavoidable necessity. — [Mrs. E. L. G., N. Y. 

To Cure Hams 

For 100 lbs meat allow 7 lbs salt, 2% lbs brown sugar, 2 
ozs saltpeter, and suflacient water to cover the meat, when 
closely packed in a barrel. Boil the salt, sugar, saltpeter and 
water, skim and then add 1 oz cayenne pepper and 2 ozs 
each ground clove and black pepper. Cool, and when cold 
pour over the meat, weight down, cover, and set away in. a 
cool place. — [Mrs. F. C. F., N. H. 

Preserving Meat Joints 

For medium sized joints allow 2 tablesp black pepper, 1 
tablesp red pepper, 3 tablesp brown sugar, and 1 pt salt. 
Mix thoroughly and apply dry to each joint all that can be 
made to adhere. Take a square of muslin large enough to 
enclose the joint and lay it on the table. Then lay on the 
cloth two or three thicknesses of paper and sprinkle some of 
the mixture on it. Lay the joint on and thoroughly rub the 
remainder of the mixture on, rubbing and stuffing it well into 
the bone end. Wrap the paper closely around the meat, then 
fold the cloth around, sew fast, tie, and hang up in a cool 
place.— [S. K. S. 

Dried Beef 

The round makes the best dried beef. For every 20 lbs 
beef, use 1 pt salt, 1 teasp saltpeter, and % lb sugar. Mix 
well together, d.ivide into three parts, and rub well into the 
meat for three successive days. Keep the beef in a jar and 
turn it over frequently in the liquid, which will fprm of itself. 
After it has soaked in this about a week, hang it up to dry, 
and after that smoke, if liked. When dry, sprinkle with pep- 
per, tie up in paper bags, and hang up in a cool, dry place. — 
[Mrs. J. L. R., O. 

Corned Beef 

Use only the poorer parts for corning, such as brisket, 
flanks, crossribs, and plate, and cut into pieces 6 inches square. 
Fifty lbs meat will require 50 lbs salt. Sprinkle a layer of 
salt in the keg or barrel, put in a layer of meat, packing very 
closely, then a layer of salt, then more meat and salt, until 
all is used, leaving just enough salt for a good layer over the 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 245 



top. Let stand over night, then dissolve 1 oz baking soda, 
2 lbs sugar, 2 ozs saltpeter in 2 gals tepid water, and after 
it is cold pour it over the meat. Two gallons should cover 
the 50 lbs meat, if packed right. If not, use the same pro- 
portions in making more. Weight with a board and stone, 
and let stand from 30 to 40 days before using. If kept over 
in hot weather, watch the brine, and if it gets "ropy," pour 
it off, wash the meat, and cover with a new brine. — [F & H. 

Beef Pickle I 

To 1 V2 lbs salt, add V2 lb sugar, 1 teasp soda, V2 teasp salt- 
peter and 1 gal water. This pickle can also be used for sau- 
sage. Be sure to weight down the meat or sausage, so as to 
keep well under the pickle. — [Mrs. C, No address. 

Beef Pickle II 

For 100 lbs beef, use Vz pk salt, % lb each saltpeter and 
soda, and 1 qt molasses, or 2 lbs brown sugar. Dissolve the 
saltpeter, soda and salt in a little warm water. The meat 
will be ready to use in 10 days. For spiced beef, add mace, 
cloves and allspice to the above pickle. — [Mrs. C, No address. 

Brine for Pork 

For 100 lbs pork allow 10 lbs salt, 3 lbs brown sugar, 2 ozs 
saltpeter, 1 oz cayenne pepper, and 4i/^ or 5 gals water. Let 
boil 5 minutes, skim well, let get perfectly cold, and then pour 
over meat packed in large jars or barrels. Put in a weight 
to keep the meat under the brine, cover the jar and set away 
in a cool place. Meat kept in this way is never rancid and 
flies do not get at it. In the spring draw off the brine, boil it 
again, skim well, let get cold, and pour over the meat again> 
—[Mrs. P. O. B., Mont. 

Sweet Pickle for Pork 

For 100 lbs of side meat or hams allow 8 lbs clean, coarse 
salt, 2 Ibc brown sugar, or 1 qt molasses, 3 ozs soda, 2 ozs salt- 
peter and sufficient water to dissolve these ingredients. Put 
over the fire and just before it boils, skim well, let it boil up 
once, skim again, and when perfectly cold pour it over the 
me:it, packed in a jar or barrel. Weight down so that the 
mea,t will always be under the brine, cover, and set in a cool 
place. After 5 or 6 weeks lift the sides and hams out of this 
brine, let drain and smoke well with corn cob, hickory or 
maple chips. We have used this recipe for years, and I am 
sure that anyone who will try it will be very well pleased 
with it. — [Mrs. M. J. S., N. U, 



246 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Pickle for Pork Sausage 

For every gal sausage in cases allow 1 cup salt and 1 cup 
brown sugar, thoroughly mixed. Place layers of sausage in 
jars and sprinkle the mixture between each layer. Put a 
stone on top, and if a brine does not form in 3 days, make a 
little cold brine and pour it over. — [Mrs. M. J. L., Mich, 

Souse 

Use the head of a hog and any other small parts of the 
animal that are not too fat. Clean the head thoroughly and 
do not spare yourself any pains during this process, to make 
sure that everything is as clean as you can possibly make it. 
Soak in salt water for several hours, then scrape and clean 
again, and then soak once more in salt water for several 
hours, after which put in a kettle, cover with cold water, add 
salt, and boil slowly until the meat will separate from the 
bones, and all the gristle is perfectly soft. Next remove from 
the fire, drain, remove all the bones, and hard gristle from 
the meat and from the liquor. Put a layer of meat and fat, 
distributed evenly, in a stone jar, sprinkle well with salt and 
pepper, and then pour over a generous allowance of hot, boiled 
cider vinegar. Then put in another layer of meat, seasoning, 
and boiled cider vinegar, and so on until the meat is all used, 
or the jar is full to within 3 or 4 inches of the top, topping 
off with salt, pepper and vinegar. Be careful to pack the 
meat firmly and closely together, and to have it covered with 
the vinegar. Boil down liquor in which the meat was cooked 
until there is only a little of it left, being careful not to let 
it burn. Season well with salt and pepper (it should be con- 
siderably more salt than palatable), and when the meat in 
the jar is thoroughly cold, pour this hot, boiled-down liquor 
over the meat, and when all has become cold, cover the jar 
well and store it in a cold place. When wanted for use, 
scrape away a little of the jelly at one side of the jar, cut out 
slices of the souse, and return the displaced jelly, spreading 
it over smoothly. The sliced souse can be fried in hot butter, 
but first drain off the liquid by allowing the souse to stand 
in the pan on the back of the stove a while. This will extract 
the vinegar, and after frying brown in butter, the souse will 
be deliciously crisp. Serve with hot, baked potatoes. — [Mrs. 
N. P., N. H. 

Pickled Pig's Feet 

Soak the feet over night in cold water, remove the toes and 
scrape clean, boil until very tender, and salt before they are 
done. Pack in a stone jar or keg and cover with hot, spiced 
vinegar, using whole cloves, allspice and pepper. Nice eaten 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 247 



just so, or heated up in boiling water, or split, rolled in flour^ 
and fried a nice brown on both sides in hot fat. Will keep 
indefinitely. — [Farmer's Wife, Col. 

Pickled Tongue I 

Use either beef or pork tongues. Scald, trim, scrape and 
boil until tender, in salted water. When cold, cut in i/^-inch 
slices, and cover with cold vinegar. Boiled pigs feet are also 
very nice when pickled in vinegar. — [Mrs. C. B. B., Kan. 

Pickled Tongue II 

For the brine allow 1 gal water, 3 lbs salt, 4 ozs sugar, 
and 2 ozs saltpeter. Boil and cool, then put in the trimmed 
and cleaned tongues, and weight to keep them under brine. 
Will keep any length of time. When wanted to use, soak 
over night in cold water, boil until tender, skim, remove skin, 
slice, and serve with mustard. Or, if liked pickled, slice 
and cover with spiced vinegar. Will keep after being pickled. 
' — [Farmer's Wife, Col. 

Pickled Tripe and Beef Tongue 

Clean the tripe thoroughly, cut in pieces, and sprinkle 
lightly with unslacked lime. Roll up each piece separately, 
with the furrowed side inside, place the rolls in a tub and 
pour over enough cold water to cover. Let stand about 10 or 
15 minutes, then lift out the pieces, lay them on a board, 
scrape them well and rinse them clean in cold water, after 
which put them in a tub and cover with a weak brine, allow- 
ing them to remain there about 12 hours. After removing 
from this brine, scald thena with boiling water, scrape them 
again lightly, and again wash in cold water, after which they 
will be ready for pickling. Make a hot spiced vinegar by 
adding 1 teasp each of allspice, cloves and cinnamon, to 1 qt 
vinegar, and V2 cup sugar. If liked very spicy, ^4 teasp 
cayenne pepper or black pepper may be added. Beef tongue 
should be put in a brine or pickle, the same as that prepared 
for beef, and allowed to remain in there a week, after which 
drain, and either smoke or dry, or put in a prepared spiced 
vinegar, as directed above. — [Mrs. A. C. McP., O. 

To Keep Roast Pork in Lard 

Take pieces of the side meat or any other part without 
bones, salt and pepper to taste, place in a roasting pan in 
a hot oven, and roast till well done, but do not scorch. When 
well done pack the pieces in a stone jar and fill all the spaces 



248 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



between, and cover the top, with fresh melted lard. Tie heavy 
paper and a cloth over the jar, and set away in a cool, dry- 
place. This will keep until warm weather comes. Fresh 
sausage cakes can be kept in the same way. After seasoning 
with salt, pepper and a little sage, mould the sausage meat 
into little cakes about 1 inch thick, fry until well done, 
and pack in a stone jar with melted lard, the same as directed 
above for the roasted meat — [Mrs. H. L. J., Wash. 

To Keep Beefsteak I 

Mix together equal parts of salt and sugar and half the 
amount of saltpeter. Place a layer of steak in a jar, sprinkle 
with this mixture, and so continue until the jar is full, then 
weight down with an inverted plate and heavy stone. This 
will form a brine of its own, and the meat will keep sweet 
for a long time. Cover well and store in a cool, dark place. — 
[M. D., O. 

To Keep Beefsteak II 

Fry beefsteak as for the table, only be sure it is not the 
least bit rare, then pack it closely in jars and cover well with 
melted lard. Store in a cool place. — [Mrs. E. S., 111. 

Smoked Pig Paunch 

Thoroughly clean a pig paunch or stomach, and boil until 
well done. Take as much lean pork as it will require to fill 
the stomach, chop fine, and cook until partly done, then mix 
with scant V2 teasp saltpeter, and season with salt, ground 
pepper and cloves, and any other preferred spices to taste. 
Pack into stomach securely, sew up and then return to the 
liquor in which the stomach was boiled, and let boil slowly 
1 hour. Remove from fire and let remain in this liquid over 
night, then drain and smoke 6 days. Hang in a cool, dark, 
airy place. When wanted, cut in thin slices and serve with- 
out cooking. — [Mrs. G. L., N. Y. 

To Try Out Lard or Suet 

Only clear, fat pieces of meat should be salted dojvn in the 
pork barrel, and all the thin, streaky pieces of lean and fat 
should be put with the sausage meat. The soft fat should 
be cut in very small pieces and put in a separate kettle, with 
a little water, and set over the fire to try out. The leaf lard 
should be cut up fine and put in another kettle, with a little 
cold water, to try out. While the lard is trying out, stir it 
up often with a long handled spoon or skimmer, and be very 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 249 



careful that it does not burn or scorch. Stirring it often will 
make the lard try out more evenly. "When the little pieces 
of lard have shrunk to very small dark brown scraps, strain 
lard through a fine wire sieve into a perfectly dry and clean 
tin pail. For the sake of convenience and to save burning 
my fingers, I hang the sieve through a piece of board cut out 
to fit the sieve. The board should be long enough to fit across 
the top of the pail, and project several inches on either side. 
This little board will not only save your temper, but will 
catch all the scraps that may fall from the top of the strainer, 
and that would otherwise fall into the pail of lard. The 
brown scraps should be turned into a cheese cloth bag and 
while still warm, squeezed between wooden squeezers to txtract 
any of the lard that is still in them. These squeezers can be 
made of two flat pieces of board about l^^ feet long and 5 
or 6 inches wide, joined together at one end with little pieces 
of leather, and the other end whittled for handle. The lard 
squeezed out this way should be put in a separate pail. When 
cold, cover the pails well and store in a cool, dry place. Suet 
is tried out the same way. After the suet is tried out, pour 
it into a pan of ice cold water, and when hard, wipe it dry, 
wrap in white paper, and then put in a linen or close cloth 
bag and hang in a cool, dry place. Excellent for pie crust. — 
[Mrs. N. P., N. H. 

Canned Suet 

Trim and chop suet fine, add salt to taste, and 1 cup molas- 
ses for every cup suet. Can in air-tight jars. This is fine to 
put in cakes or puddings and no other shortening will be 
needed. — [Mrs. K. St. J., N. Y. 

Calf's or Hog's Head Cheese 

Put a large kettle over the fire, almost filled with water, 
and let heat to boiling point. You will need a large kettle as 
the calf's head should be almost entirely under water. After 
the butchering, when the animal heat is well out of the head, 
lift it by one ear and hold it in the kettle of boiling water, 
nose down. It will scald in a few minutes, so that with a 
sharp knife you can easily scrape off the hair, leaving the 
head nice and white and clean. Wash thoroughly, then saw 
off the nose, just at the comers of the mouth, being careful 
not to saw through the tongue, or to saw on to the teeth. 
With a sharp, pointed knife, take the eyeballs out, first cutting 
the muscles around them, then cut off the ears and remove 
the ear drums, and then wash the head again thoroughly and 
rinse in cold water, after which put in a kettle or pail of 
cold water and let it soak over night. Fc tliis^head cheese 



250 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



I also use the heart, liver and lungs or "lights," as the latter 
are called, also the legs, as far as the knee. Carefully trim 
and clean the heart, liver and lungs, and let these soak in cold 
water over night. The legs should be scalded, scraped 
cleaned and washed, and also put to soak in cold water over 
night. Next morning rinse all in clean cold water, and then 
put over the fire in several kettles of cold water to cook, 
adding salt. Cook slowly until the meat drops from the 
bones, then drain, pick out all the bones, and chop or grind 
fine. The tongue should be removed whole, root end cut off 
and discarded, the rough skin or coating scraped off, and saved 
for a separate dainty, to be served cold, in slices. After chop- 
ping all the meat, add enough boiled-down liquid in which the 
meat was cooked, to make the meat very moist. The liquid 
will be jelly-like and will help to make the meat hold together, 
so that it can be easily sliced when cold. Add salt and pep- 
per and a little sage to taste, and while hot turn into molds 
and set away to cool and harden. Cover with melted lard and 
store in a cold place. Hog's head cheese is prepared in the 
same manner, discarding most of the fat. If there seems to 
be too much fat on the liquid left after cooking the head and 
legs, skim the fat off and use the liquid underneath. Nice 
sliced, rolled in fiour, and fried brown on both sides. — [Mrs. 
E. C. W., Me. 

Hog's Head Pudding 

Cut the meat from hog's head, discard the skin, and also 
use the heart, tongue and part of the liver. Wash all 
thoroughly and scald the tongues to remove the coating. Cook 
until tender, then grind or chop fine and season with salt and 
pepper, after which return to the liquor in which the meat 
was cooked, and when it begins to boil, thicken with buck- 
wheat flour or cornmeal. Be sure to season just right, and 
have the pudding stiff enough, so it can be cut in slices when 
cold, to fry, like mush. — [Miss A. E. H., Pa. 

Potted Beef, Ham, Tongue or Liver 

Boil either tongue or liver in salted water until very tender 
and put through the meat grinder. Boil down the liquid 
until there is just enough to moisten the meat nicely, being 
careful it is not too salty. Mix well with the meat, heat, put 
in little jars, and pour melted suet, lard or butter over the 
top, when cold. Potted ham can be made in the same way. — 
[Farmer's Wife, Col. 

To 1 lb boiled lean ham add V2 lb ham fat, or if preferred, 
butter, a little cayenne pepper and white pepper, mix all 
together, pound until smooth, press firmly into small jars.

THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 251 

cover with melted butter or lard, seal, and store in a cool 
place. — [I. C, Va. 

Boil beef until it is tender and separate from the bones. 
Then mince the meat fine, reason to taste, and pack down 
solidly in small close jars, topping off with melted suet. Cover 
and store in a cool place. — [Mrs. E. R. W., Va. 

Sausage Casings 

Casings can be made from the intestines of beef, hogs, or 
sheep, the sheep casings being used for small sausage, like 
wiener-wurst, and hog casings for link sausages, and beef 
for bologna sausage, ham sausage, and blood sausage. 
Empty as soon as possible, turn inside out and scrape and 
clean first the in and then the outside. The cleaning is easy 
where one has running water. Soak 24 hours in lime water 
or lye v/ater, turn, scrape and rinse again, then salt down and 
use when needed. When one cannot clean the casings, good 
substitutes can be made by stitching up tubes of new 
unbleached muslin, 1^ or 2 feet long, and 2 or 3 inches in 
diameter, when filled. When ready to hang away, rub the 
outside well with melted lard, to exclude all air, and sprinkle 
with pepper. — [Parmer's Wife, Col. 

Uses for Bladders 

Wash, scrape and clean thoroughly, soak in salt water, 
rinse, and then inflate and tie them. When making preserves, 
cut off pieces large enough to cover the mouths of the jars, 
pour boiling water over the bladder pieces, then stretch them 
tightly over the jars and tie securely. These are equal to self- 
sealing, air-tight cans. Bladders are also useful to keep sau- 
sage meat. Stuff full of the sausage meat, tie securely and 
smoke. — [B. M. R., Va. 

Filling Sausage 

Sausage meat should be finely ground, as it keeps and holds 
together better. Beef alone, or pork alone can be used, but 
better two-thirds fat and lean pork, and one-third beef. Vary 
the seasoning by using pepper, onions, sage, nutmeg or cloves 
— the latter two are not very common. For filling the skins 
a piece of bone 2 or 3 inches long is most serviceable, but a 
piece of tin, shaped into a funnel, smallest end a trifle smaller 
than skins, will do very nicely. Insert this funnel into one 
end, hold in left hand, and proceed to fill, using the thumb to 
force the meat down. Prick the casings often with a hatpin, 
to let out any air. To have a change make some with cooked 
barley and some with potato (raw), finely chopped or ground. 
Use the proportion of ^/i of barley or potatoes. This is fine. — ■ 
[Farmer's Wife. Col. 



252 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



Liver Sausage I 

*^ 

• Boil liver till done, chop, season with black and red pepper, 
sage and salt, and pack in casings or long narrow muslin 
bags, and hang up to dry. Smoke with sassafras chips. — 
[No Name. 

Liver Sausage II 

Boil the liver and heart until tender. Chop very fine, sea- 
son to taste with salt and pepper. Add some clean currants, 
if liked, mix well, and fill into casings. Should be fried brown 
and served hot. — [Mrs. G. L., N. Y. 

Liver Sausage III 

Boil a pig's liver 10 minutes, then grind or chop fine and 
add twice as much cooked lean pork, and i/4 lb fresh bacon, 
also ground or chopped. Season to taste with salt and ground 
pepper, cloves and nutmeg. Fill into casings, leaving about 
2 inches space in each sausage unfilled, as the liver swells. 
Boil the sausages % hour in salted water, then put them in 
cold water 10 minutes, after which they may be smoked or 
hung in a cool place to dry. — [Mrs. J. P. D., Neb. 

Kidney, Heart and Liver Sausage 

Split the kidneys and soak them in strong salt water, 
changing the water several times, then wash thoroughly and 
put them in a large kettle with the heart and liver, bits of 
pork rind, and scraps of lean pork. Cover with water and 
boil until tender. The liver must be lifted out after boiling 
10 or 15 minutes, as it does not require such long boiling 
as the rest. When the meat is all tender run through a sau- 
sage grinder, season with salt, pepper and a little thyme, pack 
into crocks, and set the crocks on the back of the range until 
they are hot. This helps to pack the meat more solidly. 
Cover with melted lard and set away in a cool place. — [Mrs. 
E. S., 111. 

Mixed Sausage 

This can be made of almost any proportion of beef and 
pork one has when both are killed at once, but is nice made 
in the proportions of 2 lbs lean pork, 1 lb lean beef, and 1 lb 
fat pork. This should be ground and seasoned the same as 
pork sausage, and kept in the same way, in casings, or jars 
with lard run over. It is better to use several small jars than 
one large one. — [Farmer's Wife. Col. 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 253 



Bologna Sausage I 

Chop very fine 6 lbs lean beef, 1 lb salt pork, 3 lbs lean 
fresh pork and 1 lb beef suet. Mix well, then add 1 oz ground 
white pepper, 1 teasp ground mace, 3 ozs salt, ^ teasp cay- 
enne pepper, and 1 large onion, chopped very fine. Mix well 
then fill into casings, or muslin bags. Make a strong brine 
that will float an egg, put the sausage in this, and let remain 2 
weeks, turning and skimming every day. At the end of the 
first week, throw away old brine, and put the sausage in a 
new brine for the second week, then take out, drain and smoke 
for a week. After smoking, rub over the outside thoroughly 
with melted lard, and if you wish to keep the sausage for any 
length of time, sprinkle outside liberally with pepper, after 
rubbing with lard. Hang in a cool, dry and dark place. — » 
[Mrs. F. E- A., Wash. 

Bologna Sausage n 

Chop or grind very fine 50 lbs beef, add 3 lbs sugar, 8 ozs 
pepper, 2% ozs saltpeter and 2^^ pts salt. Mix the dry 
ingredients thoroughly, then mix thoroughly with the meat and 
fill into casings or thin muslin bags about 4 inches wide and 
12 inches long. Do not put these sausages into brine, but 
smoke them until thoroughly dry. — [Mrs. C, no address. 

Bologna Sausage HI 

Use trimmings of fat and lean portions of pork, taking 
care to have twice as much lean as fat. After trimming and 
cutting, weigh the pork and add % its weight of lean beef. 
Chop or grind fine and then season with 2^^ lbs salt and 10 
ozs ground pepper for each 100 lbs ground meat. A little sage 
or thyme may also? be added, if liked. Mix thoroughly and 
let stand in a cool place about 24 hours, after which fill into 
casings and fry down in hot lard. Put into crocks and cover 
with hot lard, and store in a cool place. — [Mrs. E. S., 111. 

Bologna Sausage IV 

Add 1 lb fat pork or fat bacon to each 10 lbs lean beef, 
and grind fine. Season with 1 oz black pepper, Vz oz fine 
salt, and a little ground coriander seed to each 6 lbs meat. 
Stuff in beef casings, making 1 foot long for the large cas- 
ings, or 15 inches for the small ones, tying the small ones 
together and letting the large ones hang straight. Smoke 
12 hours, then boil until they float on the water. Lay on 
clean hay in the sun until dry, and then hang away in a cool 
place. — [Farmer's Wife. Col. 



254 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



To Prepare Casings for Sausage 

Select the best of the beef casings, empty and wash them 
thoroughly, then throw them into a strong brine and let them 
soak several hours, after which rinse them thoroughly in 
fresh water, turn them, lay them on a smooth board and 
scrape them clean with the back of a knife. Rinse and soak 
in salt water again, then give them another scraping and 
wash again, and do not rest satisfied until you are positive 
they are perfectly clean. After they have been thus treated, 
put them in salt water, changing water frequently, until you 
are ready to use the casings. I think that sausages packed 
into these casings with a sausage stuffer are much better than 
sausages packed in muslin bags. — [E. S., 111. 



Scrapple I 

Cook until tender, hogs' livers, hearts, and scraps of lean 
meat. Salt to taste, and when done, remove the meat, boil 
the liquid a little longer, and then thicken with cornmeal 
until it is a thin mush. Let this cook well, and then add the 
meat, minced fine, and salt, pepper and sage to taste. Pour 
into pans to cool, and when wanted, slice and fry until brown 
on both sides. — [Mrs. F. L., Iowa. 

Scrapple BE 

Clean and cut up one hog's head and remove all skin and 
larger bones. Let soak in salt water over night, and next 
morning wash again and put over the fire in cold water enough 
to cover. Cook slowly until the bones separate from the meat, 
then drain, pick out all the bones and hard gristle, and chop 
or grind the meat fine. Strain the liquor and return it with 
the ground meat to the kettle, season with salt and pepper 
to taste, and when it begins to boil, stir in, slowly, enough 
cornmeal to thicken, adding some white flour to make it 
hold together. Stir constantly until done, then spread out in 
pans, and when cold cut in slices and fry brown on both sides. 
By running melted lard over it, it can be kept a long while. 
^— [Mrs. F. G. F.. O. 

Mince Meat, Canned 

I always make mince meat during the butchering season. 
To 8 lbs meat, (either pork or beef, or both mixed) boiled and 
chopped fine, add 6 lbs cleaned currants, 6 lbs seedless raisins, 
4 lbs suet, 2 lbs citron, 20 lbs raw apples, all chopped fine, 
12 lbs sugar, 2 gals boiled cider, 12 tablesp cinnamon. 8 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 255 



tablesp mace and 4 tablesp each of allspice, salt and grated 
nutmeg. Put the cider in a large kettle, let it come to a boil, 
and then put in the other ingredients, well mixed together 
and boil 1 hour, stirring frequently. Can while hot, in air- 
tight jars, with a layer of melted lard or suet on top. If all 
the usual canning precautions were observed, mince meat 
canned in this way will keep indefinitely. — [Mrs. M. M., Kan. 

Calf's Foot Broth and Jelly 

Clean and scald the feet, cut up, cover with water, and boil 
until the liquid is reduced to one-quarter. Season to taste, 
thicken with 1 beaten egg, and serve plain, or with a few 
homemade noodles boiled in it. For jelly, boil the liquid 
down to 3 pts salt, then strain and let get cool, after which 
remove the layer of fat, re-heat the jelly, and add 1 cup 
sugar, the juice of 2 lemons, the whites of 2 eggs, small pieces 
of stick cinnamon, and about Vz pt good wine, if liked, and 
intended as nourishment for an invalid, although the latter 
may be omitted. Strain through a cloth and set away to get 
solid. Serve cut in small cubes. — [Mrs. J. C. R., Ind. 

Pig's Feet JeUy 

Clean and boil pig's feet till well done, without salt. Strain, 
and to 1 qt liquor add 1 pt sugar, and flavor to taste. Boil 
skim and pour in molds. Serve with cream. 

Pig's Feet Cheese 

Clean feet, boil till bones fall out, remove bones, add a few 
bay leaves, 2 slices lemon, 2 cups vinegar, a few cloves, and 
salt to taste. Cook until tender,., then pour into a mold to 
cool. Serve in thin slices. 

To Cook an Ox Cheek 

Split the head in halves, remove tongue, brain and eyes and 
wash first in salt water and afterward in 2 or 3 fresh waters. 
When clean put into a saucepan of cold water, add salt, and 
let boil 4 hours. When it has been boiling about 2 hours add 
potatoes, onions, carrots, turnips, and celery, according to 
taste. Cooked in this way the liquor makes a nice soup, and 
the meat taken from the bone and served with a little of the 
soup for gravy, makes a tender and savory dish for the first 
day's dinner. The soup is better served next day. If there 
should be any small pieces of the meat left from the dinner, 
they may be cut up with 2 or 3 hard-boiled eggs, sprinkled 
with a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg, put into a mold,, and 
turned out for breakfast, luncheon or supper. 




Tlddenda 

INCE this book was first published, in 
1907, various changes have been made, 
and new illustrations inserted, for which 
the recipes will be found on the following 
pages. This is felt to be a distinct im- 
provement on the first edition, and one 
which will be generally appreciated. Variety is certainly 
the spice of life to the good cook, and in this book she will 
find no lack of it. For each of the recipes following, an 
illustration will be found on the page noted. A trial of 
each is recommended. 

Brown Bread 

[See illustration on Page 8.] 

Mix 1 cup each of rye meal, corn meal, graham flour, and 1 
teasp salt, then stir in a mixture made of 2 cups sour milk, 1 % 
cups sweet milk (or water), % cup molasses, and % tablesp 
soda. Turn into well-buttered molds and steam 3i^ hours. 

Bran Muffins 

Mix 2 cups bran and 1 cup ilour, with V2 teasp salt, then cut 
in 1/4 cup butter, and chop fine with a chopping knife, so that

morning add 1 scant cup butter, 1 cup sugar, 2 or 3 well-beaten 
eggs, and warm sifted flour, enough to make a sponge. Set in 
a warm place to rise, and when light knead, using no more 
flour than necessary. Let rise again, then shape into small 
buns, cut a cross on tops, put in well-greased pans, let rise till 
light, then brush the tops with sweet cream, sprinkle with 
sugar and bake in a moderate oven. Another ivay: After 
the dough has raised for the second time, roll out % inch thick, 
spread with cream, sprinkle with sugar, roll up like jelly cake, 
pinch the edges, and cut off slices about % inch thick. Place 
flat on a well-greased pan, let rise till light, and bake in a 
moderately quick oven.

teasp soda and a pinch of salt. Turn % the batter into another 
bowl and add 2 tablesp cocoa wet with 2 tablesp hot water 
and 1 teasp vanilla. To the yellow part add a teasp of lemon 
extract. Use small cake tins, and with yellow batter, teasp at a 
time, make a ring a little more than an inch wide. Inside this 
ring lay a ring of dark batter, and fill in center with yellow. 
Make two of these layers, then one other with dark batter on 
outside ring and in center (this is to be the middle layer, 
when cake is put together). Ice with % lb confectioner's 
sugar wet with sweet cream and vanilla extract. Bake cake

2 tablesp sugar and sift in % teasp bicarbonate of soda and Vz 
teasp cream of tartar. Beat 3 eggs, add 1 cup milk, then pour 
into the dry ingredients. Mix well, and half fill gem pans, 
which have been greased and heated. Bake in a moderate 
oven half an hour. 

Christmas Plum Pudding 

[See illustration on Page 80.] 

Take 1 pt bottle grape juice and soak therein 1 small loaf 
of bread. Take 1 lb finely chopped suet, 2 lbs each of raisins 
and currants, and 1 cup walnuts, broken, not chopped; dredge 
over them all enough flour to keep them .from sticking. Beat 6 
eggs very light, add 1 lb brown sugar, then the soaked bread 
and fruit, etc, also i^ lb citron, cut very fine. Season with 1 
teasp salt, 2 teasp allspice, 1 teasp cloves, 1 nutmeg, 4 teasp 
cinnamon. The mixture should be so stiff a spoon will stand 
upright, but if too stiff (for some flours thicken more than 
others), a cup of milk may be added. Put in 4 greased bowls, 
cover and tie cloths over, so no water can get in. Steam 8 
hours, adding water as needed. A dishpan may be used and 
will hold all 4 puddings, in which case cover with another 
dishpan. 

Grape Foam 

['See illustration on Page 81.] I 

Pour a large coffee cup 14 full of grape juice, put in scant 
Vo cup sugar and fill up with boiling water. Turn into a basin 
and add ^2 cup more of water and let come to a boil. When 
boiling pour this over 1 package of some orange gelatin instead 
of the pt of hot water v/hich the directions for making call 
for. Stir till clear, turn into a deep bowl and set in an outer 
dish half full of cold water. When the jelly begins to quiver 
as if setting, whip with an egg beater till it is light and 
foamy. Place in outer dish of cold water again. 

Put y2 cup sugar and 2 tablesp hot water with a tiny pinch 



2 60 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 



of cream of tartar in a basin on the stove. Cook till the syrup 
drops from fork in threads. Have ready the white of 1 egg 
in a soup plate, beaten to a dry foam. Pour the syrup over 
this slowly, beating constantly. Beat till €ool, then fold into 
the stiffened grape foam. Drop a little on top of each sherbet 
glassful. 

Grape juice from either wild or tame fruit may be prepared 
by pouring enough water over the fruit to cover, after picking 
from the stem, and boiling till soft. Pass through a cheese- 
cloth bag, boil up again, and if not to use at once, seal airtight 
in fruit cans. 

Plain Pumpkin Pie 
[See illustration on Page 96.] 

Pare a good pumpkin or squash and cut into strips, and 
steam in a colander over a kettle of boiling water. When per- 
fectly tender, pass through a coarse sieve. To each pt pump- 
kin add 1 cup sugar, 3 well-beaten eggs, 1 pt rich milk, and 

1 teasp each of cinnamon and ginger, and ^ teasp nutmeg. 
The spices can be omitted if liked. Mix well and bake in deep 
pie tins lined with thin pastry, until a golden brown. 

Cream Pumpkin Pie 

[See illustration on Page 97.] 

To 1 pt pumipkin add 1 cup sugar, 1 cup cream or rich milk, 

2 well-beaten eggs, 2 tablesp melted butter (if cream is not 
used), 1 teasp each of cinnamon and ginger, and % teasp salt. 
Bake in deep pastry lined tins. Just before serving (the pie 
should be cold before serving), cover the top with whipped 
cream flavored with a little vanilla. Very pretty if a few 
candied cherries are placed over the top. 

Longfellow Cake 

[See illustration on Page 112.] 

This cake is really a white fruit cake, and to make it you

"A Cornish Pasty and Dish of Tay" 

[See illustration on Page 208.] 

Should you be driving in Cornwall, England, late in the 
afternoon and begin to feel that it is time for afternoon tea, 
you will hail with gladness the thatched inn, where the driver 
tells you that you may get a- "Cornish pasty and a cup of tay." 

The pasty looks like an American apple dumpling, but it 
doesn't taste like one. It is so good that you ask the quaintly 
garbed Cornish woman for the recipe, and very much to 



264 THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 

your surprise she consents to give it to you, and in turn it 
is here given. 

The woman declared that there were "pasties and pasties,'* 
but that the real Cornish ones are made after the directions 
given, and that they varied in size, some being much larger 
than others, particularly when served with a cup of "tay" 
to travelers. 

Cornish Pasty — Cook a good-sized onion until tender, chop 
it finely and mix it with i/4 lb steak cut into dice, and the same 
weight of boiled potatoes also cut into dice, adding salt and 
pepper to taste. Roll out a proportionate quantity of short 
crust to about i/4 inch thick and cut it into rounds about the 
size of a silver dollar. Put a little of the meat, onion and 
potatoes on each round and sprinkle again with pepper and 
salt. Wet the edges of the paste, press them lightly together, 
making, if you can (it is not difficult), a frill on the top, 
and carefully insert a knife beneath the frill for a vent. Bake 
from 35 to 40 minutes. 

Lemon Jelly 

[See illustration on Page 209.] 

Soak 2 tablesp granulated gelatin in % cup cold water %i 
hour, then add 2^^ cups boiling water, 1 cup sugar, and % cup 
strained lemon juice. Pour in a wet mold and set away to 
chill. Serve with sliced oranges and bananas. 

Apple Kaisin Cake 

[See illustration on Page 224.] 

Mix 1 small cup bread sponge, % cup warm water, ^^ teasp 
salt, 3 tablesp each sugar and lard, 1 beaten egg and 1 cup 
raisins. Stir in iy2 cups flour, let rise in a warm place and 
beat down. Turn into a deep pie pan. Pare, core and quarter 
3 apples, halve the quarters and press on the cake, round side 
up. Sprinkle over scant ^> cup sugar mixed with 1 teasp 
cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. Dot with butter. Let rise 
1 hour and bake slowly in a moderate oven. Take from the 
oven and sprinkle with sugar. 

Beet and Potato Salad 

[See illustration on Page 225.] 

Boil beets as usual, slip off the skins, and cut in rather 
thick slices, then, while still warm, put them in a vinegar 
bath slightly salted and sweetened. Leave them in the vine- 
gar a few hours, or until the beets have become pleasantly acid. 
Prepare mashed potatoes, using plenty butter and just enougli 



THE ORANGE JUDD COOK BOOK 265 

milk, then arrange on a platter with lettuce leaves, alternately, 
slices of the beets with layers of the mashed iwtatoes. 

How to Roast Beef 

[See illustration on Page 240.] 

Wipe the beef clean and dry, put on a rack in dripping-pan, 
skin side down, rub over with salt, and dredge meat and pan 
with flour. Place in very hot oven, that the surface may be 
quickly seared, thus preventing escape of inner juices. After 
flour in pan is browned, reduce heat, and baste with fat which 
has tried out; if meat is quite lean, it may be necessary to put 
trimmings of fat in pan. Baste every 10 minutes; if this rule 
is followed, meat will be found more juicy. When meat is 
about half done, turn it over and dredge with flour, that skin 
side may be uppermost for final browning. 

If there Is danger of flour burning in pan, add a small quan- 
tity of water; this, however, is not desirable, and seldom need 
be done, if size of pan is adapted to size of roast. Beef, to 
be well roasted, should be started in a hot oven and heat 
decreased, so that when carved the slices will be red through- 
out, with a crisp layer of golden brown fat on the top. Beef 
roasted when temperature is so high that surface is hardened 
before heat can penetrate to the center, is most unsatisfactory.
