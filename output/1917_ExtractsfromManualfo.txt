CHAPTER I. 
THE RATION. 

1. A ration is the allowance for the subsistence of one person for one 
day. The garrison ration ia intended for troops in garrison, and 
in time of peace tor troops in maneuver camps; the ration to be 
issued to troops on the march in time of peace vidll be prescribed 
by the commander and will not exceed the allowance prescribed 
for the garrison ration; the travel ration is for troops traveling 
otherwise than by marching and separated from cooking facilities; 
the reserve ration is carried on the person of the men and in the 
trains, and constitutes the reserve for field service; the field ration 
is the ration prescribed in orders by the commander of the field 
forces; the Filipino ration is for use of the Philippine Scouts; and 
the emergency ration for troops in active campaign for use on 
occasions of emergency or in the field for purposes of instruction. 

In time of war when Philippine Scouts are serving in the field 
they will be subsisted the same as are regular troops. When im- 
practicable for Philippine Scouts to use the Filipino ration while 
traveling otherwise than by marching, on account of the lack of 
cooking facilities or for other reasons, the travel ration may be 
prescribed. 

The Hnds and quantities of the component articles of the Army 
ration and the substitutive equivalent articles which may be issued 
in place of such component shall be as follows:

One day in each alternate month of the season of practical instruc- 
tion, not exceeding 3 days in each year,, the use of the reserve 
ration with individual cooking will be required by all troops in 
the field for purpose of instruction. 

4. Field Ration. 

The field ration is the ration prescribed in orders by the com- 
mander of the field forces. It consists of the reserve ration in 
whole or in part, supplemented by articles of food requisitioned 
or putchased locally, or shipped from the rear, provided such sup- 
plements or substitutes correspond generally with the component 
articles or substitutive equivalents of the garrison ration.

Scout organizations will be required to use the entire allowance 
of the meat component, and not more than 16 ounces of rice per 
day to be used for each ration. The purchase of 1.6 ounce of beans 
per ration in substitution of the portion of the rice ration not 
drawn will be made, and use of as large an extent as possible of 
native products, such as camotes, mongos, and squash, wUl be 
required. 

6. Emergbncy Ration. 

The emergency ration is furnished, in addition to the r^;ular 
ration, as required for troops on active campaign or in the field 
for purposes of instruction, and will not be opened except by 
order of an oflScer or in extremity, nor used when regular rations 
are obtainable. 

Ration returns upon which emergency rations are drawn will 
bear the certificate of the organization commander that such 
rations are required for the enlisted men of his organization and 
that the money value of any rations previously drawn by him, 
and improperly opened or lost, has been charged against the per- 
son responsible. 

Company and detachment commanders are responsible for the 
proper care and use of emergency rations carried on the person 
of the soldier. 



KAiniAL FOS AKH7 COOKS. 11 

All articks of the garrison, tmvel, or Filipino ration due a com- 
pany or other oiganisation will be retained by the quartennaster 
and ctedit given to the oiganizatiou for the money value of these 
articles at the current price of the articles, and the quaitermaster 
will pay as savings to the organization commanders any excess 
in value of the stores so retained over those purchased by the 
organization. Such savings shall be used solely for the pur- 
chase of artides of food. 

When on the marck in tinte of peace a daily issue of rations will 
be made in the manner prescribed in the Field Service R^nla- 
tions for the time of war. The ration to be issued to trooxis on the 
march in time of peace will be prescribed by the commander, 
and will not exceed the allowances prescribed for the garrison 
ration. 

In timt of peace the ration savings privilege will be suspended 
for troope on the maitdti, except that when so ordered by the com- 
mander the savings privil^e will be allowed on certain specified 
articles of the ration. 

Upon arrimd of troops at mobilization or concentration camps 
the ration saving priArilege will be suspended and entirely replaced 
by issue of rations in kind. This same restriction also applies 
during the i>eriod of field operations. 

The commanding officer will designate the periods for which 
ration returns are to be submitted. Immediately upon the re- 
ceipt of a ration return by the quartennaster duly signed and 
apjwoved he wiU enter it, t(^ther with the actual cost of the 
ration as compated on the back of the ration and savings account. 
The stores required will be purchased from the quartermaster on 
charge sales slips, in the name of the o^anization, against their 
credit shown on the account. At the end of the month, or when- 
ever necessary, the organization commander will setde the ac- 
coimt with the quartermaster, when the savings due the organiza- 
tion, or the amount due tiie quartermaster, as the case may be, 
will he paid and the accoimt certified as required. 

All articks of the ration required for the supply of tooops will 
be obtained from the quartermaster when on hand, but if any 
article be not in stock a temporary supply may be porchased 
ebewhene. 

When Tiecessary to reiietc reserve rations or to avoid loss <rf ration 
articles that have accumulated, the quartermaster will report 
the facts to the commanding genial or commanding officer, as 
the case may be, who, if he considers it necessary to prevent Io@, 
will give in writing the necessary ordeis looking to the issue <t

such supplies to troops. Such issues will not exceed the ration 
allowance and will be continued until the surplus is exhausted 
or until such other action as may seem advisable can be taken 
to protect the interests of the Government. 

2. On account of the variation in the cost of the ration in different 
localities, the ration and savings account should be settled upon 
departure from a post, to include the last day for which rations 
are taken. Upon arrival at a new station a new account is opened 
and credit given at the prevailing price at the new station, thus 
avoiding any pecuniary loss through having to purchase articles 
of the ration at prices higher than those upon which the credit 
allowance was computed. 

BATION TABLES. 

3. The cash value of the garrison and travel ration is determined 
by taking the percentages of the several components and sub- 
stitutive articles as indicated below at the price current during 
the month:

4. After securing a price list of ration articles from the quarter- 
master for the ensuing month, the mess sergeant should consult 
the preceding table in order to fix in his mind the quantities and 
value of the different ration articles he will make use of and the 
amounts he will leave to the credit of the organization. 

He should make a saving on the beef component in order to pur- 
chase Uver, hearts, fish, pork, chicken, etc. 

From the savings ori flour he should purchase prepared breakfast 
food and oatmeal. 

From the savings on potatoes he should purchase cabbage, sweet 
potatoes, turnips, and fresh vegetables in season. 

A proper use of the bean component will enable Hm to purchase 
Lima beans and other varieties of beans often cheaper than the 
issue bean. 

The savings on prunes (dried fruit) may be used when the differ- 
ent fresh fruits are available to supply a change. 

The stock on hand in the storeroom must be considered in order 
that the total on hand will not exceed the requirements for the 
period for which drawn. 

The mess sergeant is able with ease to purchase quantities sufficient 
to run the mess for given periods without having an excess amount 
of stock on hand at the end of the ration period. This will often 
prevent his organization from being in debt after the inventory of 
subsistence stores near the end of the month. 

5. The preceding table should be memorized by the mess sergeant 
and the cooks, in order that they may know the components on 
which the cash allowance is based. While under ordinary condi- 
tions in garrison or permanent camp the organization may be on 
the cash allowance, the regulations provide for an issue in kind 
while on the march or in the field. 

6 . Thefollovnng table is ot especial assistance to the mess sergeant 
when rations are issued in Mud.

HOW TO KEEP WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CKEDIT ALLOWANCE OF 
THE GARRISON RATION DAY BY DAY. 

7. Due to the fact that the monthly inventory of subsistence 
stores is taken at any time from the 23d to the 27th of the month, 
it is almost impossible for the organization commander to keep an 
accurate check on his ration allowance. For example, the date 
of this inventory may vary one day in an organization of 100 men, 
increasing or diminishing by about $25 the cash credit of the 
organization for that month. 

The ration return is usually submitted on the first day of each 
month, based on the strength of the organization as shown by the 
morning report of the last day of the preceding month. The ad- 
ditions or deductions for the preceding month are credited or 
deducted on this ration return. 

If the number of men fed during the month remained constant, 
the mess sergeant could base his expenditures on his cash credit 
for the month. But as this number changes from day to day, the 
amount expended each day should be based on the actual number 
rationed that day. 

It frequently happens that the mess sergeant fails to allow for 
the changes in the number of men he feeds during the month 
and bases his expenditures on his ration allowance computed by 
the quartermaster from his last ration return. Thus, if the strength 
of the company is 70 men and the month has 30 days and the value 
of the ration is 25 cents, his ration return will call for 2,100 rations, 
or $525. If he has to prepare 200 additional rations during the 
month, he should allow his company $575 instead of $525. 

On the other hand, if there is a reduction in the number of men 
fed, causing a deduction of 200 rations prepared during the month, 
he should aUow his company $475 instead of $525.' If he does not 
allow for this deduction, he will find it necessary to reduce his 
allowance per man the following month so as to avoid running 
into debt. Thus it happens, that the mess sergeant frequently 
feeds the company bountifully one month and scantily the next, 
because he considers his credit with the quartermaster for that 
month instead of his daily allowances as shown by the morning 
report. 

For this reason it is better to run the mess on a daily cash basis 
computed from the strength of the organization present each day 
as shown by the morning report. 



KANTTAL FOB ARMY COOES. 21 

The sergeant computes the cash value of a ration for the current 
month as per table in paragraph 3 or obtains the same from the 
quartermaster. Each day he computes the cash allowance for 
that day and takes care to see that the cooks do not exceed it or 
that they exceed it only when a saving has previously been made 
. to cover the excess. 

If in the field, on the march, or at mobilization camps, it will 
be necessary for the command to subsist on the ration in kind. 
The mess sergeant should each day compute the allowance of the 
components authorized in orders for the number of men present 
for rations carried on the morning report of the organization. Care 
should be taken to see that this allowance is not exceeded for that 
day in the preparation of the bill of fare, except when a saving 
has previously been made. 

The table in paragraph 6 will prove useful in computing this 
allowance in kind when drawing or issuing, on the march, or in 
mobihzation camps. 

The general scheme of figuring the bill of fare one day ahead 
should be followed, and in doing this the ingredients to be used in the 
various dishes for each meal should be set down on a memorandum 
or scratch pad and an accurate record kept of/ the value of all 
articles used for the bill of fare. See copy of scratch pad memoran- 
dum in connection with the following bill of fare. 

This method will at first appear irksome and unnecessary, 
but it is the only positive method of keeping track of the daily 
ration allowance either on a cash basis in garrison or when draw- 
ing rations in kind in the field, on marches, or in camp. 

The ingredients on the memorandum are copied on the bill of 
fare when the meal is prepared. The memorandum is then de- 
stroyed and the bill of fare serves as a voucher by means of which 
the company commander checks the stores on hand. 

A model "Daily report" and a model "Daily mess statement" 
follow. 

The daily mess statement is the daily statement required of the 
organization mess sergeant. 

The daily report is made up by the first sergeant and turned 
over to the mess sergeant each morning. It shows the number of 
men to be present at the three meals — dinner, supper, and break- , 
fast — and is filed by the mess sergeant as a voucher to the daily 
mess statement. See first two lines top of model daily mess state- 
ment, " Number of men in mess."

A bill of fare based on the ration in kind can be readily prepared 
by consulting the table in paragraph 6, showing the quantity of 
the different components and substitutive articles allowed per 
ration. The mess sergeant or cook can quickly ascertain the 
amounts of the different ingredients he should use for the day. 
This table should be used on a cash basis as well as when drawing 
the ration in kind. This in order that there will be no confusion 
when subsisting under the different methods prescribed in orders. 

The various schools for bakers and cooks have blank forms for 
keeping mess accounts. These consist of bills of fare, stock sheets 
or daily mess statements, and daily reports. They can be secured 
upon application to the schools direct. 

The following bills of fare have been prepared as a general guide 
for winter and summer. They are merely offered as suggestions.

CHAPTER II. 
THE RATION COMPONENTS. 

8. Beef. — This component is dealt with in Chapter III. It is the 
most important as well as the most expensive article of the ration, 
its value being about equal to all^e other components combined. 
It is the foundation of the ration and careless handling will soon 
put an oiganization in debt, while if it is handled carefully sub- 
stantial savings may be made with which to purchase pork, chicken, 
and other meats not included in the ration. The organization 
commander should pay particular attention to the beef and flour 
components, which taken together amount to more than one-half 
of the value of the ration. 

9. The cash value of the beef component if properly handled is 
sufficient to cover the cost of all meats used in the company kitchen 
and provide a saving for other articles. By careful selection of 
such low-priced meats as liver, beef hearts, and sausages, together 
with such high-priced meats as pork, fish, chicken, etc., an average 
price will result which will enable one to secure a satisfactory 
variety, while living within the limits of the ration. Such pur- 
chases are economical when it is considered that these low-priced 
meats are generally without bone, which in beef constitutes about 
20 or 25 per cent of the whole weight. 

Remember that in handling meat in the kitchen aU bones and 
trimmings must be retained until the juices are extracted for stock 
and all suet and fat are rendered for drippings. 

When meat is received in quarters it is of the utmost importance 
that the mesa sergeant and cooks understand how to cut it up for 
kitchen use and for what purpose each cut is best adapted. The 
instructions given in the following pages should be carefully fol- 
lowed. All tough parts of fresh meat should be put through the 
grinder and u^ed as Hamburg steaks, hash, and meat balls. 

Remember that in cooking tough meats a long period of alow 
cooking is required. 

All meat should be sliced in the kitchen before serving in order 
that fats, gristle, and other portions that will be left, if taken on 
the men's plates, may be saved and either rendered out or used 
in some other form. 

10. Specifications for frrsh beef. — ^To be good in quality and 
condition, fit for immediate use, and equal numbers of fore and 
hind quarters to be delivered, including all the best cuts; no car- 
cass to weigh less than 500 pounds when trimmed; neck;^ to be cut 

27 



28 MANUAL FOR ABICY COOES. 

off perpendicular to the line of the vertebrae, leaving but three 
cervical vertebrae on the carcass; the shanks of fore quarters to be 
cut off at the knee joint and hind quarters at the hock joint (com- 
mercial cut), and to compensate for the shank bone thus allowed 
to remain 2i pounds will be deducted from the weight of each fore 
quarter and SJ pounds from each hind quarter; difference between 
fore and hind quarters not to exceed 25 pounds per carcass (one rib 
to be left on each hind quarter). Necks, kidney fat, beef from 
bulls, and stags and from females (except from spayed heifers) will 
be excluded from delivery. Such quantities of fresh meat as may 
be required by the quartermaster from time to time shall be deliv- 
ered to him in bulk at the quaitermaster's storehouse or other 
designated place on such days and at such hours as he may pre- 
scribe under the direction of his commanding officer. 

11. Remarks on specifications. — In order that the difference in 
weight between fore and hind quarters shall not exceed the limit 
(25 pounds per carcass) the cut must be made so as to leave one rib 
only on the hind quarter, and this is the ordinary packing-house cut. 

The minimum weight is placed at 500 pounds to insure getting a 
proper proportion of meat to bone. 

The specified n^ck cut is unusual in commercial transactions, 
and the dehvery will generally be made with five or six neck ver- 
tebrae left on the carcass unless special attention is paid to this 
trimming. The neck meat is worth commercially about one-half 
the contract price for the carcass, and it should be accepted under 
no circumstances. 

The deduction of 2 J pounds for the shank of the fore quarter and 
3J for the hock (both of which were formerly cut out before de- 
livery) is very apt to be overlooked by the contractor unless es- 
pecially cautioned by the responsible person. Neglect to make 
the neck and shank trimmings and deductions net the contractor 
more than |3 a carcass even when the price is as low as 11 cents 
per pound. 

By "kidney" fat is meant the fat immediately surrounding the 
kidney and does not refer to other suet in the hind quarter. 

The meat from bulls, stags, and cows is excluded for the reason 
that it is inferior to that from the steer of the same age and condi- 
tion. 

A careful study of the characteristics that definitely determine 
the differences between these classes of carcasses is necessary in 
order to protect the interests of the Government and of the com- 
panies. 



KANTTAL FOB AS.JSY COOKS. 89 

12. Sex of beef. — By definition, the bull is the uncastrated male, 
and the stag a male castrated late in life. In practice, a bull is 
castrated when he has served his purpose, and economy requires 
that he should be placed on the market. Being castrated he takes 
on flesh and being fattened brings a better price at the stock yards. 
As a bull he will rarely fatten under any circumstances, but in 
either case the flesh is, very dark — conspicuously so — and the 
muscles "stand out," hard and compact, especially on the shanks. 
In the cod there is almost an entire absence of scrotal fat. The 
carcass of the bull or stag shows massive shoulders, a thick bulging 
neck, broad chest, a very round rump, and coarse-grained flesh. 
His fore quarters are relatively larger than his hind quarters. 
His general makeup is so different from that of the steer that if 
after careful examination of the carcass a doubt exists as to whether 
it is a steer or a stag (or bull) the chances are that it is a steer. 

The flesh of bulls and stags is drier than that of steers and cows 
and is used to advantage in bologna and sausages, for when cured it 
will have taken up and retained more moisture than other classes 
of beef. As a rule, contractors will not now attempt to run in such 
meat in quantity, but if it is dehvered it should be promptly 
rejected. It is generally tough and unstdted to company use. 

A steer is a male not full grown, castrated when young, and an 
ox the corresponding full-grown animal. Generally speaking, 
we call the meat from the carcass of either "steer meat," and for 
Army use the only beef dehvered should be from animals from 
2 to 6 years of age, excepting only the meat from the "spayed 
heifers," which is occasionally suppKed. 

A spayed heifer is a female from which the ovaries were removed 
early in Ufe. Cows are sometimes spayed after having had one 
or more calves, if it is necessary to let them run at large with a herd 
while preparing them for the market, but if the operation has 
been performed at all the scar should be generally plainly visible 
in the left flank (though the ovaries are sometimes otherwise 
removed). 

A cow is a female that has had a calf. A maiden heifer is an 
adult female that has not been allowed to breed. 

Cows are frequently not placed on the market until much benefit 
has been derived from them either for dairy or breeding purposes, 
and consequently they are generally older than steers when slaugh- 
tered. If killed within a certain period before or after calving, 
they are considered unfit for food. 



30 MANUAl FOH ARMY COOKS. 

Generally speaking, a steer produces considerably more flesh to 
bone than the cow, and the carcass of a steer at the present time 
brings from 2 to 2i cents per pound more than that of a cow in 
the same condition. This explains the tendency of contractors 
to run in cow meat whenever it will be accepted. 

13. Age and qwality. — The age of dressed beef can be estimated 
by the character of the cartilage tipping the spines of the dorsal 
vertebrse; by that between the vertebrae throughout the spinal 
column, and by that in the brisket, sufficiently well to indicate 
the toughness or tenderness of the beef so as to regulate its accept- 
ance or rejection. When the layers of cartilage between the 
vertebrse become so tough and hard as to resist the penetration 
of the point of a skewer of soft pine wood, the quarter should gen- 
erally be rejected because the steer was too old. The eye will 
note as accompanying this condition a very limited amount of 
cartilage in the brisket (practically none in the cow); the bones 
of the sacrum will have generally grown into a solid mass, with 
few or no hnes of demarcation between the several vertebrae; 
the cartilaginous extensions of the spines of the dorsal vertebrse 
will be more bone than cartilage (in the cow they will be solid 
bone); the diaphragm will be exceedingly tough; the bones will 
present a bleached-out appearance instead of beiag ruddy or full 
of blood as in youth, and the marrow will be hard and Ught yellow 
or almost white instead of soft and red. Generally the fat will be 
hard and yellow instead of soft and white as in youth, although 
in some breeds of cattle the fat is naturally yellow at all ages. 
The cartilage of the joints will be pale white instead of having 
a bluish tinge as in youth, and more or less "water" may be 
present. 

The flesh of veal is of a pale red color. That of a steer should be 
a bright red; a deeper red indicates greater age and toughness. 
The flesh of a cow is generally darker than that of a steer in the 
same condition. The flesh of bulls and stags is very dark, so dark 
that it should be at once detected. Color in meat should be 
judged from portjons that have been cut a few minutes previously. 
Freshly-cut portions and those that have been exposed to the air 
for a considerable period present an unnaturally dark appeamace. 
(For method of telling age of cattle on the hoof, see par. 2305, 
.Manual for the Quartermaster Corps, 1916.) 

In passing upon meat it should be remembered that the contract 
specifications are so definitely stringent, so far as the contractor 
is concerned, and so liberal with respect to the troops, that almost 



MANITAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 



31 



any quality of beef can be procured that is insisted upon by the 
quartermaster and post commander. It is contemplated , by the 
Quartermaster Corps that the beef shall be "good in quality and 
condition," etc., made as to the same by the post authorities. 
A strict interpretation of the requirements results in high bids 
and increased cost of the ration. 

It is considered, however, that regardless of what may have 
been the contractor's estimate of the situation at any particular 
post, he should be required to comply strictly with specifications 
as to sex, weight of carcass, trimming of necks, and allowance of 
weights for shanks, etc., but that a reasonable interpretation 
should be put upon the clause referring to "quality and condi- 
tion." Beef for Army use should be only moderately fat, though 
the fat should be well distributed and the cuts of lean meat present 
a marbled appearance. Beef in good condition and otherwise 
complying with the contract should be accepted if between 2 
and 6 years of age. It is perfectly evident that we can not 
expect to be supplied with com -fed beef from native stock 2 
years of age and younger, as part of the regular ration. 

14. Selection of parts for different uses in the kitchen. — ^The parts 
of the carcass should be selected in the following order when 
quality alone is considered:

1 While the higher grades of meat may be boiled or corned, it desired or if neces- 
sarj; to save them from spoiling, the parts above mentioned are those selected 
during the regular routine of kitchen work as being the most economical. 

For Hamburg steak and potpies, meat from all parts of the car- 
cass may be used, though the quality will, of course, depend 
much upon the tenderness or toughness of the parts used. 

For stews, any part of the carcass may be used; but for reasons 
of economy it is best to use the parts noted for boiled beef. 

For soups, all bones broken or sawed, and the particles of meat 
clinging thereto, may be used. Left-over meats may be worked 
as noted in theTecipes.

UAHTTAL f OR ABUY COOKS. 33 

17. Preserving fresh mgat. — Fresh meat is more nutritious and 
palatable than salted or cured meat. It is therefore desirable to 
use as large a proportion of fresh meat as possible. In a company 
refrigerator -with a temperature of 55° F. fresh meat can be kept 
with safety for three or four days. "When the temperature is 
reduced to 40° F., or less, with good ventilation and circulation 
of air, fresh meat can be kept for a week or 10 days. It is very 
important that the circulation be free and the air dry. Moisture 
in a refrigerator tends to develop wet mold or slime, and a little 
decay soon contaminates the whole piece. Less difficulty will 
be experienced in preserving fresh meat if it is kept in a room where 
the temperature is relatively high and the air dry than where 
the temperature is low and the air damp. 

In the North, meat is kept during the cold season by freezing. 
A carcass is cut up into quarters, or even smaller pieces, and hung 
in an outbuilding where it will remain frozen solid . When a por- 
tion is wanted it may be cut oft with a saw. If the meat is then 
taken into a cold room and slowly thawed out the flavor is only 
slightly injured. No more should be taken in at one time than 
is wanted for immediate use. Repeated freezing and thawing are 
injurious to the flavor and quality of the meat, hence the impor- 
tance of keeping it where the temperature will remain stifflciently 
low to prevent thawing. 

Insects should not be allowed to get at the meat. For this 
reason a dark, cool cellar is a good place for keeping it. The 
cellar should be well ventilated, clean, and free from odors, or 
the meat will become tainted. 

18. How to preserve fresh meat when refrigerator faxsilities are not 
at hand. — It should be himg in a cool, dry place, and in a draft if 
possible. It should be well protected from flies by having cheese- 
cloth or other gauzy material for a covering and this should be 
hung loosely about the meat so as to permit a free circulation of 
air. If care be exercised in the handling of meat it can be kept 
for several days without the least sign of decay. A test to reveal 
the commencement of decay is the knife blade test. Insert a clean 
knife blade in the meat to the bone, and if it can be extracted 
without resistance of the tissue it is an indication that the meat 
has begun to decay. The smell of the blade will indicate whether 
decomposition has commenced. 

2479°— 17 — 3 



34 HAHUAL FOR ABDCY COOKS. 

The cloth used for the protection of the meat is principally tn 
keep flies from it, and hence it should not at any point come in 
direct contact with the meat. The meat miay be hung in the 
middle of a frame made of barrel hoops. The cloth is then placed 
around the hoops, thus preventing flies from reaching the meat 
and permitting a free circulation of air. It may frequently be- 
come necessary to keep meat for several days in camp. In wooded 
country a good place is generally found in the shade of a tree and 
about 3 or 4 feet from the ground. However, it is still better to 
hang the meat about 30 feet high in the branches of a tree. In 
case no trees are available it should be hung in a shady spot pro- 
vided by erecting a fly and suspending the meat from the ridge- 
pole, where it will have plenty of draft. 

19. Curing meats. — Meat must be properly and thoroughly 
cooled to insure good keeping quahties when cured. If salted 
before the animal heat is out, the shrinkage of the muscles causes 
the retention of injurious gases, giving an offensive odor to the 
meat. Neither should meat be frozen when salted, as the action 
of the frost will prevent the proper penetration of the salt and an 
uneven curing will result. It is important, also, that meat be 
cured as soon as cooled and while still fresh. Tainted meat may 
be ciured so that it will keep, but nothing in the line of preserva- 
tives can bring back the natural flavor when it is once lost. The 
safest rule to follow is to salt meat as soon as the animal heat is 
out and before it freezes or starts to decay. Ordinarily, 24 to 36 
hours after slaughtering will allow time for cooling. 

20. Pork. — Fresh pork is. not suppUed by the Quartentoster 
Corps, and when desired, must generally be purchased from sav- 
ings on the ration, imlesa hogs are raised by the company. The 
cutting up of pork is very simple, as the meat is tender and the 
bones are relatively soft. Unlike beef and mutton, it should be 
cut as soon as cooled throughout. If the carcass is thoroughly 
chilled, it is well to have two knives and one cleaver, the utensils 
not in use being kept submerged in a bucket of hot water. If 
the carcass is still warm, an extra knife is not necessary. Trim 
off most of the fat and use the loin for chops and the shoulder and 
ham for roasts. All left-over parts — head, skin, and shanks — 
may be used, together with an equal portion of beef, in the pre- 
paration of headcheese or sausage.

dressed carcaas of mutton to be about 50 pounds. 



UANUAL FOR AKKY COOES. 37 

The leg may be cut into steaks, but is generally roasted or boiled. 
The loin may be cut into chops, using one rib to a chop, or may be 
roasted. The shoulder may be used as a roast when from a yotmg 
animal, or as boil when from an old one. The brisket and flanks 
may be used for stews and the neck and shank for soup stock. 
The meat remaining in the stock boiler may be used up in fritters, 
meat balls, croquettes, etc., though the juices having been ex- 
tracted, the meat will be hard and dry. 

22. Soup. — ^A good stock soup should be prepared daily for din- 
ner and served in a course by itself, before the more substantial 
portion of the meal. Serve plenty of croutons or crackeiB with it, 
seeing that it is hot when served and that the grease is skimmed off. 
Soup stock should be made fresh every day or two. Cut the fresh 
meat into small pieces, break or saw the bones and place them to- 
gether in cold water for several hours, then put on range and 
allow to simmer for about six hours. After about two hours of 
simmering the juices will be extracted from the meat. The meat 
should then be removed from the boiler before the fibers have be- 
come hard and indigestible, and placed in a cool place for use 
in hash, meat balls, etc. The grease rises to the top and forms a 
crust, which may easily be removed and placed in the drip pan. 
The stock when prepared should be poured into another receptacle 
and cooled. The stock boiler should then be cleaned out and a new 
start made. Beef stock is not only used in making soup, but in 
hash, stews, gravies, pot pies, etc. 

The average cook does not seem to realize that he has more 
opportunity to show his skill in preparing a good appetizing soup 
thim in most other dishes. Seasoning such as can be obtained from 
a judicious use of different kinds of pepper, celery, bacon, or parsley 
and a substantial filling of different vegetables will produce a dish 
which the men will enjoy as much as any part of the meal. 

23. Bread andflowr. — ^This is the cheapest component of the ra- 
tion, considering the nutritive value, and consequently the greater 
the quantity used, the less expensive will be the mess. At least 
10 per cent should be saved on this component after buying the 
flour and bread used in the kitchen. This saving should be used 
for the purchase of breakfast foods, for which no allowance is 
given. Bread should not be cut untU just before it is to be used and 
then in thin slices, which should be piled close together in orSer 
to prevent it from drying out. It should be purchased in small 



38 MANUAL FOB AKMY COOKS. 

quantities as required from day to day. Bread left over should be 
piled in the form of the loaf before it was cut, covered with a cloth, 
put in the bread box, and served first at the next meal. All crumbs 
and pieces of dried bread not desirable for the table should be saved 
and placed in a &oxa sack and allowed to dry out. It may then be 
toasted and ground for use in place of cracker crumbs or in pre- 
paring croquettes, meat balls, etc. Milk toast and bread put- 
tings should be served often enough to use up the remainder of the 
dried bread. 

The flour should be used in the preparation of biscuits, pan- 
cakes, hot rolls, and desserts. 

Bread and rolls that have dried out may be greatly freshened by 
moistening and placing in a slow oven for half an hoxa. Place a 
moistened &oxa sack or dish towel in the bottom of a bake pan so 
that the ends may be folded over the bread or rolls, or place a 
pan of boiling water in the bottom of the oven and the pan of 
bread or rolls on the top shelf without a cloth, leaving the oven door 
on the second notch. The bread should be allowed to remain in a 
20-count oven for about 20 minutes. 

Hard bread which is ordered sold to the troops to prevent its 
accumulating may be toasted and used in soups, chowder, bread 
puddings, etc. 

Com meal should be served occasionally as mush, fried or in 
com bread. 

24. Baking powder. — The allowance is sufficient for one mess of 
pancakes, biscuits, etc., each day. Usually about one-half as 
much of a more expensive baking powder is required. In using 
baking powder remember that it, with the other ingredients, 
should be mixed with cold water or milk and used at once. This 
is because the action of water on the ingredients in the powder 
causes the carbonic gas, which makes the dough light and spongy, 
to form and escape. If the mixture is not used at once it should 
be kept cool, otherwise this gas will escape and the results will be 
unsatisfactory. The best rule is to use at once after mixing. 

Becipefor hahing powder. A very good baking powder can be 
made as follows: Take 16 ounces of cream of tartar, 8 ounces 
baking soda, and 4 ounces of cornstarch and mix thoroughly by 
putting through a sieve at least nine times. 

25. The bean component is one of the most important. Beans 
and peas contain much muscle-building material and with the right 
proportion of fat added in the form of bacon (about 20 per cent) 



MANUAL FOB, AEMY COOKS. 89 

are equal to meat in food value, and are a suitable substitute for 
fresh beef. The variety of beans served should be as great as pos- 
sible. The best results are obtained by soaking the beans lirree 
hours, pouring off the water, scalding them in a second water which 
is poured off, boiling them an hour in a third water, then allowing 
them to simmer until done; This gives the beans a more agreeable 
flavor than if the water is not changed. 

For an organization of 100 men the maximum amount of dried 
vegetables to be used in a 30-day period, even during the season 
when fresh vegetables are not plentiful, is as follows: 

Issue beans, 200 pounds. This is sufficient for five messes of 
baked beans, three messes of stewed beans, and three soups. 

Dried peas, 60 pounds. This will make three messes of stewed 
peas. 

Lima beans, 60 pounds. This is sufficient for three messes of 
stewed beans. 

Kidney beans, 45 pounds. This is sufficient for three messes of 
stewed beans. 

Chili beans, 50 pounds. This will furnish sufficient beans for 
two meals of chiU con came and two of stewed beans. When 
served as a vegetable, add five pounds of bacon. 

Rice, about 70 pounds. This should supply three meals of 
boiled rice, three of curry and rice, and about two puddings, and 
leave sufficient for soups. 

Dried sweet com, 40 pounds. This is sufficient for three messes 
of stewed com and three of soup. It takes up very readily about 
twice its weight of water and can be prepared in about 50 minutes. 

Hominy, 30 pounds. This is sufficient for three messes. Should 
be served as a vegetable, boiled, with diced bacon added. It may 
be boiled and, when cold, sliced, fried, and served with sirup. 
The canned lye hominy is much enjoyed by the men when fried 
brown in ham or bacon fat and served at breakfast. 

26. Vegetables consist of potatoes, onions, and canned tomatoes. 
The allowance of vegetables is ample during the winter months, 
while during the season of fresh vegetables a considerable saving 
should be made. This saving may be used for the purchase of 
fresh garden truck, or, when a company garden is provided, should 
be added to the general mess fund. During the winter and early 
spring the mess will derive gi;eat benefit from the dried vegetables 
mentioned in the preceding paragraph. 



40 MANUAL FOR ARUY COOKS. 

Onions and tomatoes are most valuable as seasoning components. 
They may be served as a vegetable about once in five days. To- 
matoes are chiefly used in soups and stews and onions in Hamburg 
steals, salads, etc. 

Potatoes should be stored in a cool, dry place. Warmth and 
moisture hasten decay and promote the'growth of sprouts. Sprouts 
should be removed as soon as they appear, as this growth ejchausts 
the nutritive value of the potato. After peeling and until used, 
tiie potatoes should be kept covered with cold water, exposure to 
the air causing them to become dark and tough. Fermentation is 
likely to start if the potatoes are left in warm water. Keep them 
cool. 

All potatoes left over should be used up in the form of fried 
potatoes, in meat balls, hash, soups, and salads. 

All left-over vegetables should be cooled and placed in the ice 
box in warm weather. This applies to potatoes, beans> and salads 
in particular. Ferments thrive in temperatures above 70° F. 
The careless cook may, through neglect, cause stomach trouble in 
warm weather. 

Cabbage is invaluable in the season when fresh vegetables can 
not be procured. It contains a certain percentage of sulphur, and 
while cooking it should be submerged in water, which absorbs the 
sulphur. 

Parsnips, turnips, beets, and carrots are all valuable for a change 
during the winter months. If purchasing with the intention of 
storiug for the winter use they should be well matured, otherwise 
they will not keep. 

27. Dried fruits. — Excellent recipes are given in this pamphlet 
for handling dried fruits, and the entire allowance should be con- 
sumed in the mess unless fresh fruit is abundant and cheap enough 
to be purchased from the savings. The acids in fruit are desirable 
in a well-regulated diet. The quantity of fruit allowed is based 
upon ordinary requirements. 

The dried fruits issued are easily prepared for the table. The 
men tire of them when they are prepared as stews too often. They 
should be prepared as butter and used as fillings for pies, rolls, 
cobblers, plum duffs, etc. 

The following recipe, by Lieut. Col. Wilkins, Quartermaster 
Corps, has furnished excellent results: 

1. Thoroughly wash the evaporated fruit in about three waters. 

2. Cover with plenty of water and soak overnight. 



UANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 41 

3. Stew slowly until tender. 

4. Rub through, a colander and add to each pound of dried fruit 
used three-fourths of a pound of sugar, one teaspoonful of cloves, 
two teaspoonsful of cinnamon, and a little vinegar. 

28. Coffee. — ^The use of tea and coffee to the exclusion of water is 
a great mistake. The quantity of coffee component consumed 
will be greatly reduced if plenty of cold water is placed on the 
table where the men can help themselves. If good coffee is made 
the allowance is hardly sufficient. The use of tea, however, 
decreases the consumption. 

Allow coffee to boil not over five minutes, then reduce to a sim- 
mering temperattire. Do not allow it to boil violently enough to 
permit the air to carry off the aroma which gives the coffee its 
agreeable flavor. If boiled for more than five minutes the tannic 
acid is extracted and forms injurious compounds which irritate 
the membranes of the stomach. The grounds should not be 
allowed to accumulate for more than three meals — ^better two — 
before the pot is scoured and cleaned. 

Tea is a very good substitute for coffee and should be used for 
dinner and supper, iced in summer. _ Jt has about the same physio- 
logical effect as coffee, but is lighter and less bulky. 

In preparing tea it is well to clean it by pouring over it boiling 
water, then put the leaves in boiling water and allow to draw for 
about five minutes just before serving. Do not allow to stand 
longer in the hot water. About three-fourths of an ounce per 
gallon of water is sufficient for strong tea, one-half ounce for medium 
strong. Tea should not be allowed to stand in tin vessels, even for 
a short time, on account of the action of tannic acid on the metal. 

29. Sugar is a cheap article of diet, considering its high nutritive 
value. Next to fat and oil it furnishes the most complete food for 
heat and energy. It is a quick-acting food and relieves exhaustion 
very rapidly. It should be placed on the table and the men should 
be allowed to help themselves. When this method is used the 
consumption will increase for a short time, but soon adjusts itself 
when properly supervised. The mess sergeant should take care to 
see that none is left on the bottom of the cups after the coffee is 
drunk. 

Granulated sugar makes an excellent simp for table use; it is 
cheaper than other sirup and the men prefer it to cheap grades. 



42 UANTJAl FOR ARUY COOKS. 

30. Milh.— The allowance is based upon the requirements for 
cofiee only. If used directly in the coffee there is sufficient for 
use twice daily. 

31. Seasonings— flavoring extracts.— The allowance is about suffi- 
cient, any excess used or saving made will affect the cash credit 
very little. Sugar, salt, bacon, ham, onions, parsnips, carrots, 
pepper, garlic, mustard, herbs, spices, lemons, and many other 
articles are used for flavoring food. 

32. Butter and oleomargarine. — The allowance, one-half ounce 
per man per day, is sufficient for hot cakes, rolls, or biscuits. It 
should be served individually. 

33. Lard and lard substitute. — The cash credit of this component 
is sufficient. The suet from beet and all surplus fat received should 
be carefully rendered. This with the grease skimmed from stock, 
soups, and gravies will furnish most of the shortening, drippings, 
etc., required in the kitchen. A pan or kettle in which the suet 
is rendered should be kept on the stove and all fat should be placed 
in it. The grease which gathers on the stock or on gravies, etc., 
should be skimmed off and placed in this pan. Each evening the 
grease which has accumulated in the suet pan is strained off into 
a jar or other receptacle and placed in a cool place. This accumu- 
lation, which is called drippings, can be used for frying, either 
deep or shallow, and can be used in rolls or pastry when carefully 
strained. Lard, however, is better for the latter. 

34. Desserts. — The ration contains all the material necessary for 
supplying a dessert each day. The recipes given herein provide 
a sufficient variety. The dessert is usually one of the cheapest 
components of the meal and should be given at dinner and fre- 
quently at supper. The men enjoy it, especially on bean day, 
when a good plum duff is much relished by those who do not care 
for beans. 

A good sauce should be provided for puddings. It costs little 
and is well liked. One gallon is sufficient for about 25 men. 



CHAPTER III. 
PBEPABATION AND SANITATION OF FOODS. 

35. Preparation of food, or proper cooking, has- much to do with 
the nutritive value. Cooking changes food into more soluble forms 
and renders it more nutritious and appetizing. The application 
of the heat necessary tor cooking destroys any disease germs, para- 
sites, and dangerous organisms that the food may contain. This 
applies to both animal and vegetable food. The cooking of meat 
brings out the flavor and odor of the extractives and softens the 
gelatinoids of the connective tissues, making the meat more tender. 
Extreme heat, however, has a tendency to harden the lean portions 
(albuminoids) and decrease the flavor. 

Meats lose weight in cooking mainly through the loss of water. 
The nutritive value of beef soup depends upon the substances 
dissolved by the water out of the meat, bones, and gristle. 

In many vegetables the valuable portions (carbohydrates) are 
contained in tiny cells with thick walls, on which the digestive 
juices have little effect. The heat of cooking ruptures these walls 
and makes the starch more soluble. The heat tends also to pro- 
duce agreeable flavors by changing the starch into sugar. 

Flour is made more palatable in the form of bread, cake, and 
pastry through the use of compressed air, yeast, or baking powder. 

Scrupulous cleanliness should always be observed in handling, 
keeping, and serving food. This is most important for the sake 
of health. Cleanliness in handling food not only consists in per- 
sonal cleanliness, the cleanliness of utensils, kitchen equipment, 
etc., but also freedom from, undesirable bacteria, other nunute 
organisms, worms, and parasites. Food, raw or cooked, should be 
kept scrupulously clean, whether in the market, the cart, or the 
storeroom, otherwise it is likely to be contaminated. Infected 
water, milk, oysters, and certain vegetables have been known to 
spread typhoid, cholera, scarlet fever, and diphtheria, thus bring- 
ing sickness and death to large numbers of people. 

Meats may also contain parasites, such as tapeworms in beef, 
pork, and mutton, also trichinae in pork, which are always injuri- 
ous to the health. 

Vegetables, too, have been known to become contaminated with 
the eggs of parasites, due to certain garden fertilizers. 

Raw fruits and vegetables should always be thoroughly cleaned 
before eating. The heat of cooking is usually sufficient to destroy 
all dangerous oiganisms. 

43 



44 MANITAL 70K ABICT COOES. 

36 . Methods of cooling meat. — The object to be attained -will often 
decide the manner of cooking. For example, in roasting meat we 
desire to retain the juices within. Hence the meat is placed in a 
very hot oven to seal the pores and prevent the escape of the 
juices, the oven being reduced to a lower temperature when the 
meat has been thoroughly browned. 

To make beef stock, first place the bones and fresh meat in cold 
water for some time, as the juices of the bones and meat are readily 
extracted in this manner. The process is hastened by the addition 
of a little salt. 

To make a stew or potpie, a part of the meat juices should be 
retained in the meat and a part in the surrounding liquid: hence 
we place the meat in cold water and bring it to boil as soon aa 
possible in order to seal the pores after a certain amount of the 
juice has been extracted. 

To get the best results in boiling beef, it is necessary to retain 
the juices within the meat. For this reason the water is made to 
boil briskly before the meat is introduced . Upon contact with the 
hot water the pores are sealed. The temperature is then lowered 
and the cooking continued at a simmering point. 

Size of articles. — ^The time required for cooking any article de- 
pends upon its size, consequently when several pieces of meat are 
roasted in the same pan, or when potatoes are baked together in 
the same oven, an effort should be made to have them about the 
same size. 

37. Temperature of baking, etc. — Frequently too little attention 
is paid to the proper temperature of the oven and to the general 
character of the meat or other articles to be cooked. For example, 
a temperature that is exactly right for browning a roast will ruin 
a fruit cake in a few minutes. To roast properly, a tough piece 
of meat requires a "slow " oven and much time in order to permit 
the heat to penetrate to the center, thoroughly dissolving and break- 
ing down the tissues, thus making it tender, while a small piece 
of meat can be roasted in a "quick oven." It is this principle of 
slow cooking in a moderately low temperature for a long period 
that renders the fireless cooker so much superior to anything else 
for certain kinds of work, especially that of cooking tough meat 
until it is tender. 

To determine the tem,perature of an oven. — A good practical method 
of determining the temperature of an oven is to insert the hand well 
into it and count the number of seconds that you are able to keep 



UANUAL FOB AKITY GOOES. 



45 



it there. In counting, repeat moderately slow 0-1000, 1-1000, 2- 
1000, and the small numbers iodicated will correspond very closely 
to the number of seconds. The burning sensation experienced 
about the roota of the nails is sufficiently uniform to the experienced 
cook to render this a reliable method. It is followed by the expe- 
rienced chef and should be by the student cook. If the tempera- 
ture of the oven is somewhat greater than anticipated, food will 
often have the appearance of being well done, when, as a matter 
of fact, the cooking has barely begun. For this reason a cook 
should have some idea as to the "times" of cooking, as well as to 
oven temperature. Consult the following table:

46 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

39. Cold is used in preventing fermentation, hence is a preservative 
of food. We conBtantly make use of this fact by placing butter, 
milk, meats, etc., in the ice box; by storing certain vegetables 
and fniits in root cellars and pits in the ground; by preserving 
yeast in a cool place; and by stopping the further proving (rising) 
of dough so that it shall not be ready to bake before the oven is 
ready to receive it. Fresh meat will keep better in a moderately 
cool, dry place than in a damp ice box at a much lower tempera- 
ture. Should hot weather require the use of the ice box, the meat 
should not come in contact with the walls or with the ice. 

Cold water keeps fresh vegetables from wilting. — It quickly re- 
stores such garden truck as radishes, lettuce, onions, etc., that 
have been exposed to the sun after gathering or have been left in 
a warm temperature for a time, rendering them fresh, crisp, and 
wholesome. Potatoes and turnips that have been peeled must be 
placed in cold water to keep them crisp and to prevent them from 
becoming discolored and tough. If cooked while wilted and dis- 
colored they retain their discoloration and toughness to a consider- 
able extent. 

Cold water draws out certain undesirable flavors when vegeta- 
bles and certain canned, barreled, or dried fish and meats are 
submerged in it. It also extracts the juices from meats and bones. 
This process is hastened by the addition of a small quantity of 
salt. 

40. Flavors. — Food should possess decided flavors without being 
too highly seasoned. It should be served hot or cold as intended. 
Generally we like our tea, coffee, cooked vegetables, and meats 
served hot, while we prefer our drinking water, butter, salads, 
fresh fruits, such garden truck as lettuce, radishes, and onions, 
and many of our desserts served cold. Many components of a 
meal that are lukewarm instead of decidedly hot or cold are most 
imappetizing. 

41. Seasoning. — Cooks must not be satisfied with learning the 
proper proportions of ingredients and think that the work is done 
when the cooking begins. Food must be properly prepared, deli- 
cately seasoned, and served hot or cold, as desired. Lukewarm, 
iU-seafloned food is unpalatable and if served in a slovenly manner 
is most imappetizing. Any amount of seasoning at the table can 
not make up for poor seasoning in cooking. The same flavors can 
not be obtained. The only cook that should be styled a chef is 



MANUAL FOE ARMY COOES. 47 

one who loses the proper proportions in cooking, who delicately 
seasons his food, and serves it in an appetizing manner. 

42. Deep lard. — ^The advantage of cooking in deep lard lies in 
the fact that lard or drippings can be heated to such an extremely 
high temperature that certain articles can be thoroughly cooked 
without giving time for the grease to soak into them. Grease boils 
at about 565 to 600° F., but this temperature is too high for cook- 
ing; the exterior of the food would be burned before it is cooked 
throughout. 

The grease begins to smoke between 385 and 450° F., and this 
is the best temperature at which to use it. A common error is to 
introduce too much food at one time, cooling the fat and allowing 
it to soak into the food before it is thoroughly cooked. If this fact 
is borne in mind, almost anything that can be fried at all can be 
fried in "deep lard." Meat balls, potato balls, and croquettes are 
rolled in egg and cracker or bread crumbs before frying; the egg 
coagulates, and the crumbs, which are held in place by it, form a 
brown crust surrounding the ball, and the grease is prevented from 
penetrating further. Com fritters contain eggs, and a good crust 
is quickly formed, preventing the penetration of the grease. 

It is noticed that as soon ae the articles mentioned have been 
dropped into the grease, which is far below its boiling point, a vio- 
lent ebullition is observed. This is diie to the escape of steam 
formed by contact of the moisture in the article introduced with 
the hot grease. All articles fried in deep lard should have as dry 
a surface as possible. If food with a damp surface is introduced, 
grease is apt to be thrown out upon the range, take fire, and cause 
trouble.

For an organization between 115 and 200 men 1 extra cook and 
1 extra cook's police should be allowed. 

44. Duties of the mess sergeant. — The meas sergeant is in imme- 
diate charge of the mess and directly responsible forite manage- 
ment. He should be a well-instructed cook — ^if possible, a graduate 
of one of the training schools — and especially selected on account of 
his fitness for the position. 

Under the direction of the company commander he draws or 
purchases all rations and other supplies required for the company 
mess. 

He prepares all bills of fare and submits them to the company 
commander for approval. 

He submits to the company commander a daily statement show- 
ing the exact financial condition of the mess. This statement 
includes receipts from all sources from the first of the month, 
the cash credit with the quartermaBter, value of stock on hand, 
the allowance from the company fund, if any, and a detailed 
report of the expenditures. A balance is struck, and clearly shows 
whether the stock on hand, the credit with the quartermaster, and 
the unexpended cash are sufficient for rtmning the mess for the 
number of days remaining in the ration period. 

He is responsible for the care and preservation of the rations 
and sees that fresh vegetables are picked over when first received. 
Those decayed should be returned to the quartermaster; others 
not in first-class condition should be washed and dried before 
storing.

He has the cooks' white clothing laundered, mended, and 
replaced when worn out. 

He frequently checks the dishes and utensils for which he is 
responsible, and submits at the end of the month a list of all 
broken or missing articles, with the names of the soldiers against 
whom charges for the same should be entered. 

He has the ice box scrubbed with soap and hot water every day 
just before the ice is delivered. He requires that all utensils, 
including those of the field equipment, are kept clean and in their 
proper places when not in use. 

He requires that the men detailed as kitchen police report not 
later than 10 minutes before mess call for breakfast and that they 
absent themselves only by authority or in case of actual necessity. 

He is present in a clean white coat and trousers 30 minutes 
before mess caE and personally supervises the final preparation of 
the food and the service of the meals. 

He is responsible for the orderly conduct of those present at 
the meals and that all enter the dining room in proper uniform 
in a quiet and orderly manner and with hands and feces washed 
and hair combed. He has the kitchen and dining room prepared 
for inspection at the time appointed by the company commander. 

He sees that all the seats at the table are occupied in succession, 
beginning with the table farthest away from the entrance. He 
prevents loud talking and other unnecessary noises and requires 
that the men wait quietly at their places until the food is passed to 
them. He prevents them from wasting food by taking more on 
their plates than they will eat. Food left on the plates is not used 
again; that which remains on the platters, serving dishes, etc., is 
returned to the kitchen, to be served in some other palatable form 
at a subsequent meal. 

He has the garbage and slop cans frequently emptied, and does 
not allow them to stand in the kitchen or near the outside doors. 
Tin cans and other noncombustible materials must not jbe mixed 
with slops in garbage cans. The garbage is frequently bmmed in 
the crematory and cans clog up the grates. If the slops are carried 
away for hogs, cans and glass are a great nuisance. 

45. Suggestions to mess sergeants. — ^The bills of fare should vary 
constantly. For each meal there should be at least one dish that 
has not been served for some time. 

2479°— 17— t 



60 MANUAI. FOB, ABIIY COOKS. 

Seasonings penetrg,te foods best in the liquid or semiliquid state 
and much, more quickly when hot than when cold, and conse- 
quently any amount of seasoning after the food is placed on the 
table can not compensate for insufficient or careless seasoning while 
in the course of preparation. 

The prevention of waste and the proper use of left-over food is 
the secret of success in compaiiy kitchens. 

The kitchen and storeroom should be kept scrupulously neat and 
the men required to clean up immediately after finishing each piece 
of work. Floors and tables should not be allowed to remain littered 
up after the necessity therefor has ceased. A piece of food left on 
the floor is sure to be stepped on and will make dozens of spots 
instead of one. Cleanliness should be the first lesson taught. 

The kitchen force should at all times present a neat, clean ap- 
pearance. Especially should the cooks be clean as regards their 
toilet, as they are continually called upon to mix with their hands 
such articles as cakes, hashes, etc., and to handle nearly all food 
products in preparation for cooking. Men with dirty hands or 
untrimmed dirty finger nails communicate filth and disease germs 
to foodstuffs which they handle. 

Each man should have definite duties assigned to him for which 

. he should be held solely responsible. Work must not be assigned 

in a general way to the kitchen force. If this is done, it frequently 

happens that some part of it is neglected and each man claims that 

he is not responsible. 

No kitchen can be managed successfully unless each man knows 
what is expected of him. Should there be a failure on the part of 
anyone to perform his share of work, the responsibility should be 
fixed at once and punishment follow immediately. 

Only those articles and cooking utensils being used in the kitchen 
or dining room should be kept by the mess sergeant. Other articles 
should be turned over to the supply sergeant so that they may be 
held in reserve to replace similar ones that may later become un- 
serviceable. Moreover, these surplus articles must be kept clean, 
and this requires unnecessary labor. 

46. Duties of the cooks. — In the absence of the mess sergeant, th^ 
first cook assumes his duties and responsibilities. Acting undeif 
the direction of the mess sergeant, he is responsible for the proper 
preparation of the food. 

The other cooks are under the orders of the mess sei^eant an4 tfe% 
tat cook. 



UANTTAL FOR ARICY GOOES. 61 

During the service of the meals the cooks remain in the kitchen 
and serve the food to the dining-room orderly and cooks' police, 
who act as waiters. 

The cooks take turns lq getting up to prepare breakfast, and the 
one who prepares it may be excused from afternoon kitchen duty. 

After breakfast the cook on duty sweeps out the oven, cleans the 
ranges and boilers, washes off the kitchen table, and, assisted by 
the kitchen police, scrubs or mops the kitchen floor. 

47. Duties of the dining-room orderly. — He should be detailed 
monthly. He is under the orders of the mess sergeant and is held 
responsible for the cleanliness of the dining room and pantry and 
for the dishes and utensUs used therein. 

Upon assuming charge the mess sergeant will verify with him 
all the dishes and other equipment for which he will be held re- 
sponsible. A strict account is kept by him in a book provided 
for the purpose of all the breakage that occurs and he reports to the 
mess sergeant the names of the men responsible for the breakage. 
Upon being relieved all breakage unaccounted for is charged 
against him. 

He reports at the dining room not later than 10 minutes before 
mess call. He then cuts the bread into thin slices and piles it 
neatly upon plates, one of which is provided for each table. Dur- 
ing the service of the meal he remains in the bread room, cuts the 
bread, and gives it to the waiters as they call for it. Toward the 
end of the meal he should be careful not to issue more than he 
thinks will be used. After each meal he gathers up the food left 
on the platters' and returns it to the kitchen for future use. 

Slices of bread not consumed are piled as closely as possible to 
prevent the exposure of the crumb to the air and consequent drying 
out. They are placed in the bread box and served first at the next 
meal. Crumbs of bread accumulating in the pantry and bread 
box are saved and disposed of by the mess sergeant. 

He takes charge of all work in the dining room and, assisted by 
the cooks' police, clears the tables after each meal. Hethenbrushes 
oft the tslbles, scrubs them with hot water and soap, rinses them 
with clean water, and dries them. He then cleans the saltcellars, 
pepper boxes, vinegar cruets, mustard pots, and sugar bowls and 
fills them for the next meal. 

After breakfast he places the stools on the tables with legs up, 
sweeps and mops or scrubs the diniag-Toom floor, using but litOa 



52 UAmTAL POS ARICY COOES. 

water, and carefully dries it. After dinner and supper he sweeps 
the dining room. As soon aa the floor is dry he sets the tables and 
aligns the stools in their proper places, being careful to make the 
tables present as clean and neat an appearance as possible. 

48. Care of equipment. — Bake pans should never be scraped or 
scoured, as this removes the bronze or bluing. They should be 
washed with soap and water, wiped dry, and hung on the back of 
the range with S hooks. 

Boilers. — Each time boilers are used, except for boilJTig water, 
they should be scoured out with Sapolio or wood ashes, thoroughly 
rinsed with clean water, dried, and sunned. 

Boilers for coffee. — ^They should be scoured with wood ashes or 
Sapolio once each day. Many cooks remove a portion only of the 
coffee grounds after each cooking, always leaving a portion in the 
pot. Good coffee can never be made in this manner. All the 
strength is not extracted at the first cooking, and it is best to 
allow the grains to accimiulate in the boiler for three meals (unless 
tea. is used for one meal of the day, in which case the coffee 
should not be carried over), and then remove the entire lot. Al- 
though there is some waste of coffee by this method, it is a great 
. deal better than any other and the coffee ^s always good. 

Dining-room floors. — ^They should be swept after each meal, 
mopped oat each morning, and scrubbed once or twice each week. 

Dining-room tables. — They should be scrubbed after each meal 
with soap or Sapolio and hot water. In this way stains can be re- 
moved with less labor and scouring material and the tables kept in 
better condition than if scrubbed once a day. 

Kitchen fhoTS. — The flushing of floors is prohibited by Army 
Regulations, but they should be thoroughly scrubbed each morn- 
ing. Whenever a grease spot appears on the floor it should be 
scrubbed out, using the scrubbing brush and plenty of soap or lye. 
After dinner and supper the floors are mopped . Always sweep the 
floor thoroughly before mopping or scrubbing. 

Kitchen tables. — They should be scrubbed With soap and water 
after each meal. Boiling linseed oil should be well rubbed into 
them once in each two or three months. 

-iiange. — ^Each morning before cleaning the kitchen, sweep out 
the ovens and rub off the range with a greasy cloth. A greasy 
cloth applied daily keeps the range in better condition than stove 
polish applied once a week. Once a week the range should be 



UAinTAL FOK ARIHY COOES. £3 

thoroughly cleaned out. To do this, remove the top and sweep 
off the oven, protecting the casing plates. Remove the soot by a 
scraper through the flue doors. The mantel should be wiped 
often with a damp cloth and when necessary washed with soap 
and water. This prevents dishes from picking up dirt and grease 
and thus soiling the tables. 

Stools. — They should be wiped with a clean damp cloth after 
each meal and should be washed with soap and water each week. 

49. Serving the meal. — ^A meal, however well prepared, must 
be served properly to give satisfaction and to prevent unnecessary 
waste. This requires a system by which everything is brought 
on the table hot or cold, as intended. All of the tables must be 
served promptly and in an orderly manner. This requires every 
man of the kitchen detail to perform properly the particular duties 
assigned to him. 

Five minutes before mess call the coffee (or other beverage), 
bread, and soup must be placed on the mess tables (the soup in 
1-gallon tureens to tables of 10 men) and the salad and dessert on 
the bread table. 

The dinner is now ready, and the mess sergeant goes into the 
dining room to superintend the service. The cooks remain in the 
kitchen and serve the food to the waiters as they come for it. 

The food, after being cooked, must be arranged on clean platters, 
vegetable dishes, etc. The outside of these dishes must be kept 
clean and all drippings of sirup, gravy, etc., removed from them. 

The table must be set with care and kept scrupulously neat. 
Order in the dining room and conduct at the table are influenced 
by the care with which arrangements are made for the reception 
of the men. 

50. All the men at each table must finish their soup before the 
remainder of the meal is served at that table. The mess sergeant 
not only superintends the service but personally assists and sees 
that all are served properly and without delay or confusion. 

As the men finiish at each table it is cleared off, the food left 
being transferred to other tables or returned to the kitchen, and the 
dishes placed in the sink for washing. 

When all have finished their dinner the food still remaining on 
the serving trays is returned to the kitchen and the bill of fare Is 
made out for supper, care being taken to use, if practicable, all the 
food left over from breakfast and dinner. At the same time the 



S4 MANTTAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

bills of fare are prepared for breakfast and dinner for the following 
day. The waste collected from the plates should not fill more than 
a quarter of an ordinary bucket. The men should be given all 
they will eat but should not be permitted to take on their plates 
more than they are going to eat. Each man may help himself as 
often as he likes, but waste of food must be met with prompt pun- 
ishment. After a few punishments there will be no further trouble . 
The men will see the benefit derived from careful management and 
economy and will appreciate the good results they themselves have 
helped to obtain. 



CHAPTER V. 
FIELD COOKING. 

51. The reguJatwns require that on the march, in concentration 
or maneuver camp, or in the field the savings privilege be sus- 
pended and the troops subsisted on the ration in kind. It is also 
provided that the commanding officer will designate the ration to 
be issued to the troops, but that it shall not exceed the amount of 
any component authorized in garrison. 

To prevent waste there must be even closer supervision in camp 
than in garrison, especially when the individual mess kit is used. 
Each man is served from the issuing table and the general tendency 
is to issue too freely, the men taking away more than they ^dll eat. 
The food left on the mess kit is wasted. The mesa sergeant should 
closely supervise this issue and insist that the cooks and the dining- 
room orderly use care and judgment when serving. Through close 
observation the mess sergeant and the cooks may learn the proper 
portions for each individual. 

52. In permanent camp.— The conveniences of a long-established 
camp gradually approach those of garrison, and where careful 
supervision is exercised troops fare well. The savings privilege is 
often granted by special authority of the War Department to troops 
serving in perinanent camp. Fresh beef may be supplied regu- 
larly and bills of fare are much the same as in garrison. The dining- 
room arrangements are more simple and the kitchen work is greatly 
reduced because each man looks after his own individual mess kit. 

With the improvised bake ovens mentioned herein plenty of 
rolls, buns, and biscuits can be baked. 

FKes are a pest in warm weather, and in all camps of the least 
degree of jjermanence the kitchen and dining room should be 
screened. When this is not feasible, a screened cage may be made 
in which to keep the food. Coal oil should be used freely about 
the refuse cans to keep away flies and destroy their larvae. 

53. In temporary mmp.—ln a temporary camp of from 5 to 10 
days the cooking is very much the same as in permanent camp. 
Meals are served to the men in the same manner and the same care 

55 



66 UANTTAI. FOE ABUT COOES. 

must be exercised in the prevention of waste. In bot or wet 
weather a fly should be stretched over the range and the rations 
carefully protected. Frequently the escort wagon in which the 
rations are carried may be used for the storage of mess supplies, and 
a tent fly should then be put up for the protection of the cooks and 
food before issue. When possible a wall tent and fly should be 
used in place of the arrangement just indicated. 

Though not absolutely necessary where the range is supplied, an 
excavation should be made in windy weather for the protection of 
the fire when an open grate is used. A pit 1 foot deep, wjth the 
additional protection afforded by the earth thrown upon the sides, 
will be ample. 

54. On the march. — ^The savings privilege is suspended and the 
ration is designated by the commanding ofiicer. The regulations 
require the issues to be made daily. The table given in paragraph 
6, showing the quantities of the component and substitutive articles 
allowed from 1 to 1,000 rations, will prove invaluable. 

The quartermaster of the troops should, if practicable, arrange in 
advance for the supply of fresh meat and bread along the route. 
If it can not be done, such qimntity of fresh meat, dependent upon 
the weather, as can be carried without danger of sjioiling, should 
be -taken along. 

Several days' supply of fresh bread may be carried under favor- 
able conditions. A field bakery unit and personnel may be at- 
tached to a command the size of a regiment. 

The above measures insure the two most important components 
of the ration for a few days, but bacon, canned meats, hard bread, 
and dried vegetables must be used on the march almost to the 
exclusion of these more bulky components. Dried vegetables 
and canned goods are convenient on accotmt of their small bulk 
and the ease with which they can be transported. 

There is little time in the morning to prepare breakfast and no 
attempt should be made to have a great variety. A few com- 
ponents, good and substantial, including plenty of coffee, are about 
as much as can be provided. Upon arrival in camp it is necessary 
to get a quick meal, as the men are usually tired and hungry. 
The idea is to have somethLug-prepared quickly as a lunch. A fire 
should be started at once to heat water for coffee, which, with some 
form of canned meat and bread, is sufficient. Then, while the 
company is making camp the cooks have ample time to prepare 



ICANITAL FOK ARMT COOKS. 57 

the nmin meal of the day, which is usually served in the late 
afternoon. ^.^ 

The folio-wing bill of fare is suggested as an example of what might 
be prepared for one day on the march. 

BREAKFAST. 

Fried bacon or beefsteak, boiled potatoes, bread, and coffee. 

LUNCH ON ARRIVAL IN CAMP. 

Canned corned beef or fried bacon or canned salmon, cold canned 
tomatoes, hard or fresh bread, and coffee. 



Soup, boiled or roast beef, or other boiled or roasted meat, 
mashed potatoes, peas, corn or succotash, bread, and coffee. 

The improvised fireless cooker described in this chapter has 
been used to advantage on the march. 

55. In campaign. — Troops subsist on the field ration. This 
ration is prescribed in orders by the commander of the field forces, 
and consists of the reserve ration in whole or in part supplemented 
by articles of food procured locally or brought from the rear. It is 
contemplated that sufficient articles of food will be added to make 
this reserve ration equal the garrison ration, when practicable. 

The arrai^ements for mesaing are dependent upon conditions 
and subject to many changes. These may approximate the ar- 
rangements in permanent camp, or on the march where the com- 
pany messes as a unit or the men may be required to cook indi- 
vidually, as when on patrol or in the presence of the enemy. It 
ia best as a measure of economy and health to prepare the food 
for the organization as a whole rather than to issue it out to indi- 
viduals or groups. Experience proves that the organization fares 
best when all members are present and the ration is handled by 
experienced men. This applies to the present field ration more 
than to any previously authorized. 

The bills of fare will be simple and the mess sergeant and cooks 
are compelled to use their utmost ingenuity to provide a variety. 
It is considered impracticable to suggest a bill of faje for the field, 
because the ration varies at different times from the reserve to the 
full garrison ration. 



68 MANUAl FOR ARMY COOKS. 

56. Field ranges. — The Army field range No. 1, complete, as 
described herein, weighs approximately 264 pounds with utensils, 
and with the addition of the Alamo attachment is designed to cook 
for 150 men. It consists essentially of two parts, viz, the oven 
No. 41 and the boiling plate. The boiling plate has three sections. 
No. 42 and two other parts, forming the Alamo attachment No. 42A 
and 42B. 

To pack the utensils and range for transportation, place the 
bake pan No. 52 on the ground. Set boiler No. 50 inside of bake 
pan No. 52; boiler No. 51 inside of boiler No. 50. Place tent 
guards inside of boiler No. 51 on bottom. Telescope the 4 joints 
of pipe. Inside of the pipe place 2 forks, 3 knives, 1 sharpener, 
1 cleaver, and 2 folding lanterns. Place joints of pipe containing 
utensils inside of boiler No. 51. Place meat chopper in boiler 
No. 51 alongside of joints of pipe. Place 2 basting spoons, 1 meat 
saw, and 1 skimmer in boiler No. 51 on top of pipe. Cover with 
lid No. 51, then No. 50. Place bake pan No. 52 upside down over 
lid No. 50. Care should be taken that bake-pan handles are well 
down to sides of the pan. Nest 4 boilers Nos. 48, 49, 53, and 54, 
No. 48 outside. Place stovepipe elbow in No. 54. Place dipper 
alongside of elbow. Place covers Nos. 54, 53, 49, and 48 on boilers 
in 'Order named. Place nested boilers Nos. 48, 49, 53, and 54 in 
rear end of oven. Place bake pans and nested boilers in front end 
of oven. Close the oven door and lock with damper lock. Place 
42A on left front comer of oven Nos. 41 and 42B on right front 
corner, inserting bar in crimp; This bar now rests against the 
pipe collar and prevents sliding. Place boilipg plate No. 42 on 
top of range, eye fitting over stovepipe flange and engaging under 
the flat hook. Make secure by fastening hook on front of boiling 
plate to the lug on back of range. The range is now secure for 
transportation. 

56. Installing Hie range (see par. 62). — On the march the range 
is ordinarily set uy by simply leveling the ground selected and 
placing the oven No. 41 and boiling plate No. 42 side by side, so 
that the oven door and fire-box door will be, at the same end. 
Draw in 42 A and 42B and secure bar lock. Insert 42 A into 42 
and rest 42B snugly on the angle iron on the rear of the range. 
The oven should not be banked, as this would cause the sheet 
iron along the sides to warp and finally burn through. Suffi- 
cient earth, however, should be tamped along the sides and closed 
end to prevent the passage of gases beneath. This earth should 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 69 

not extend above the straps along the sides and under the oven 
door. 

When used for one day only it Tvill be unnecessary to dig a 
trench, but if a few shovelfuls of earth are removed from the place 
to be covered by the boiling plate it will facilitate firing. The 
best results are obtained by using short wood — keeping the fire 
well toward the firing end of the boiling plate — or, if using long 
sticks and branches, pushing them imder the boiling plate as they 
are consumed. 

57. Trenching.- — If the range is to remain in place for several 
days, prepare trench as shown in paragraph 62. 

When the range is set up on different ground daily no difficulty 
will be experienced in obtaining the proper temperature in the 
oven, both for top and bottom heat. Whenever it remains for a 
longer time than one day in the same spot, the ground will become 
dried out and hot, and it will be necessary to elevate the bake pans 
slightly above the floor of the oven, thereby leaving an air space 
under the pans. This can be done by the use of angle irons or 
other means. Never use earth or sand on the bottom of the oven 
chamber, for by so doing a hole will soon be burned in the bottom 
of the plate. 

To instal the range on a railroad car or on a wooden floor, see 
paragraph 70. 

58. Bridk fire box. — -The trench may be eliminated by installing 
the range on a brick wall about 8 inches thick and 3 bricks high. 
Set up the range temporarily and mark on the ground the outline 
of the oven. Alamo attachment, and boiling plate. Build the wall 
on the outline and on the line between the oven and boiling plate 
the wall extending about 4 inches on each side of the outline, so 
that the base of the range will rest on the center of the wall. Then 
set up the range on the wall and fill up with earth or brick the 
space under the oven, except about 6 inches at the rear end. Bank 
the outside of the wall with earth. 

In a permanent camp (see par. 63) it is frequently necessary to 
evaporate waste under the range and to consume the garbage by 
the same fire. In this case dig a pit about 4 feet long, 3^ feet wide, 
and 2 feet deep, to give a reservoir for waste water. Pill the pit 
with cobblestones, leaving a fire box and a gas chamber under 
boiling plate and Alamo attachment as suggested for teinporary 
installation. Place a length of stovepipe or any kind of chute at 



60 KANtTAl FOR AEKT COOKS. 

a convenient place anywhere along the side of the oven, arranging 
the rocks on which it rests so that there will be a free passage for 
the water. Pour in the waste water as it acciunulates, retaining 
all solid matter with a wire screen. The solid matter is burned in 
the trench under the boiling plate, a little at a time, after the meal 
has been prepared. 

59. Reassembling for transportation. — When reassembling for 
transportation, draw boiling plate No. 42 forward. Unfasten bar 
lock, pull apart, and remove 42 A and 42B and proceed as indicated 
above. 

60. Remarks on handling the range. — If properly installed, the 
oven will not be too hot on the bottom for ordinary baking, owing 
to the fact that the fire does not strike the range proper. A tin will 
be found inside the baking chamber, which may be used if for any 
reason the bottom of the oven is too hot. Should the bottom of 
the oven be too cold for efficient baking the tin should be removed . 
Articles brought to a boil on the boiling plate will continue to 
simmer if set on top of the oven or if placed alongside the oven. 
In this manner a dinner has been prepared for an entire battalion 
by adding the necessary utensils. A little care and judgment are 
necessary to secure satisfactory results. 

Coal should never be used when wood is obtainable. If possible, 
even when coal is used, part of the fuel should be wood, for the 
use of coal alone will quickly destroy the range. 

In permanent camp the space above and on the sides of the oven 
and the stovepipe should be cleaned at least once a week. This 
also applies to the boiling plates. The range, boiling plates, and 
pipes should be coated with a mixture of sugar and grease. This 
preservative prevents rust and gives a neat, polished appearance 
to the range.

FIBELBSS COOKERS. 

64. Afireless cooker is an air-tight receptacle for the slow prepa- 
ration of partly cooked food by heat stored up in the food, or 
•mechanically introduced as when soapstones are used. It is also 
jUsed to preserve the temperature of food cooked or imcooked. 

It is generally a box-like arrangement liaed with a noncon- 
aducting material within which is the well or reservoir, into which 
!.the vessel containing the hot food is placed. 

Many different makes of fireless cookers are found on the market, 
and various material such as asbestos, paper felt, hay, indurated 
fiber, etc., are used as nonconductors. In some types heated 
-rBoapatones are placed in the well to keep the food at a cooking 
tempetatuce ioc long periode^ or to supply the heat oidinarily 
^vto to the food be&Ke itia placed in the cx>oker. 



64 



KANlTAi; FOK ASnCT COOKS. 



To cook food requires th.e application of a certain amount of 
heat at a temperature between 130° and 385° F. (in the case of 
fireless cookers, between 130° and 212°) though the lower the 
temperature the longer the process will be. 

The object of a fireless cooker is simply to use the heat above 
130° P. which has been stored in the food to finish cooking it. 

The advantages are: The food may be served warm on the 
march or upon arrival in camp; it saves fuel; being a slow process 
it renders such food as tough meats tender and palatable; and the 
food, having been placed iu the cooker, requires no further atten- 
tion. 

To prepare food for cooking in the fireless cooker the general idea 
is to place food on the range and when sufficient heat has been 
stored up in it to transfer the food directly to the cooker, where 
cooking will continue as long as the temperature remains above 
130° P. 

By experience the following times of cooking have been ascer- 
tained:

HANUAL FOK ARIffY COOKS. 



66 



To get the best results, most articles of food to be cooked should 
be covered with liquid when put in the cooker. 'Such vegetables 
as potatoes, parsnips, etc., should be about half cooked, the water 
dtaiaed oft, and then put into the cooker. The vegetable is then 
allowed to finish cooking with its retained heat, remaining in the 
cooker for a few hoiUB only. 

A considerable amount of acid is found in tomatoes, and dishes 
containing them should not be permitted to remain in the fireless 
cooker or other tin receptacles for longer than foiir or five hours. 
Coffee should be first prepared by boiling in a sack in the regular 
boiler so that the grounds need not be placed in the cooker. 



65. 



IMPROVISED FIRELESS COOKER. 




Most satisfactory flreless cooker yet devised, which is a milk can placed within 
a water or ash can with hay or straw packed in between. In camp the large cans 
are used for water and the small ones for cooking, so that no unnecessary impedi- 
menta is carried. 

The type of fireless cooker shown has proven as efficient as any 
on the market and more convenient for field service. Those on 
the market are too heavy and bulky for field use, and are not 
popular in garrison.

HANTJAL EOB ARMY COOKS. 



Used as an improvised cooker, two of the water cans and two lOr 
gallon milk cans mil provide one meal of coffee and hot beans or 
beef stew for 80 men. Eight of these cans will supply lunch for 
about 300 men, and, when loaded on an escort wagon, leave suffi- 
cient room for rations and equipage. 

The food can be prepared at the same time the cooks are pre- 
parii^ breakfast and placed in the cooker, which is loaded on the 
wagons, so as to be readily accessible when needed. 

INDIVIDUAL cooking; 

' 66. Weights and measures. —It will often be necessary to issue 
rations to men individually where there are no scales available. 
The ordnance cup will be found very convenient for determining 
weights tmder these conditions. The new regulation cup holds ]J 
pints; the old cup holds seven-eighths of a quart.

soldier when thrown upon his own resources, the following bills 
of fare have been prepared. "Where the tin cup and spoon are 
mentioned, reference is made to those issued with the field mess kit. 

The best fire for cooking is a small clear one or a few brisk coals. 
Almost any article of food can be cooked in some way in the mess 
kit, though the methods of cooking^re few and the quantities that 
can be cooked are small.

SUGGESTIONS FOR HANDLING BILL OF FAKE NO. 1. 

69. Take two-thirds of a cup of water and bring to a boil. Add 
4 spoonfuls of rice and boil until tender — i. e., until it can be 
mashed by the fiiigers with but little resistance. This requires 
about 15 minutes. Add 2 pinctes of salt, and after stirring pour 
oft the water and empty the rice out on the lid of the mess pan. 

Meanwhile, fry 3 slices of bacon until slightly browned in the 
mess pan over a brisk fire or hot coals and lay them on top of the 
rice, leaving sufficient grease in the pan in which to fry the flapjack. 

Take 6 spoonfuls of flour and one-third spoonful of baking pow- 
der and mix thoroughly. Add sufflicient cold water to make a 
batter that will drip freely from the spoon. Add a pinch of salt 
and 2 pinches of sugar and pour the batter into the mess pan, 
which should contain the grease from the fried bacon. Place over 
medium hot coals and bake from 5 to 7 minutes. See that it will 
slip easily in the pan and then, by a quick toss, turn it over and 
continue the baking from 5 to 7 minutes longer or until, by ex- 
amination, it is found to be done. 

While the batter is frying^ wash out the tin cup, two-thirds fill 
with water, and let come to a boil. Add 1 medium heaping spoon-

Tea.— A little more than, medium strength, the same as when using % ounce to 
the gallon, and within the ration allowance if made three times per day. 

Chocolate and cocoa. — About 1 ounce per man per meal. If available, milTt 
should be used in the place of water, and should be kept somewhat below the boil- 
ing point. Mix a l^und can of evaporated milk with 3^ quarts of water to make 
1 gallon of milk of the proper strength for use in making cocoa or chocolate

and let boil for about 5 minutes. Let simmer for about 10 min- 
utes longer. Settle by a dash of cold water or let stand a few 
minutes. 
A hot meal is now ready. Time, about 40 minutes. 



72. Bacon. — Cut the side of a bacon in halt lengthwise. Then 
cut slices about five to the inch, three of which should generally 
be sufficient for one man for one meal. Place in a mess pan with 
about one-half inch of cold water. Let come to a boil and then 
pour water oft. Fry over a brisk fire, turning the bacon once and 
quickly browning it. Remove the bacon to lid of mess pan, 
leaving the grease for frying potatoes, onions, rice, flapjacks, etc. 

Fresh meat, fried. — Put one or two spoonfuls of grease in mess pan 
and let come to a smoking temperature, then drop in the steak 
and, if about one-half inch thick, let fry for about one minute 
before tiumng, the time depending upon whether it shall be rare, 
mediimi, or well done. Then turn and fry briskly as before. Salt 
and pepper to taste. 

Applies to beef, veal, pork, mutton, venison, etC; 

Fresh meat, stewed. — Gut into pieces of from one-half to 1 inch 
cubes. Kll cup about one-third full of meat and cover with 
about 1 inch of water. Add such fibrous vegetables as carrots, 
turnips, or cabbage, cut into small pieces, and let boil or simmer 
about an hour. Potatoes, onions, or other tender vegetables are 
added when the meat is about half done. Amoimt of vegetables 
to be added ia about the same as meat, depending upon supply 
and taste. Salt and pepper to taste. This applies to all fresh 
meat and fowls. 

Fresh fish may be handled as above, except that it requires less 
time to cook. Potatoes, onionis, and canned com are the vegeta^ 
bles generally used with it, thus making a chowder. A slice of 
bacon improves the flavor. 

Stews may be conveniently cooked in mess pan or tin cup. 

Fresh meat, broiled. — Cut slices about 1 inch thick, from half as 
large as the hand to four times that size. Sharpen a stick or 
branch about 2 to 4 feet in length and weave the point of the stick 
through the steak several times so that it may be' readily turned 
over a few brisk coals or a small fire. Allow to brown nicely.

tuming frequently. Salt and pepper to taste. Meat with con- 
siderable fat is preferred, though any meat may be broiled in this 
manner. 

FBESH VEGETABLES. 

73. Potatoes, fried. — ^Take two medium-sized potatoes or one 
large one (about one-half pound), peel and cut into slices about 
one-fourth inch thick and scatter well in the mess pan in which 
the grease remains after frying the bacon. Add sufficient water 
to half cover the potatoes, cover with the lid to keep the moisture 
in, and boil from 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the cover and dry 
as desired. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Potatoes, boiled. — Peel two medium-sized potatoes or one large 
one (about one-half pound), and cut into cubes of about 1^ inches. 
Place in mess pan about three-fourths full of water, cover with 
lid, and let boil or simmer for 15 or 20 minutes. They are done 
when easily penetrated with a sharp stick. Pour off the water 
and allow to dry for one or two minutes over hot ashes or light 
coals. 

Potatoes, baked. — ^Take two medium-sized potatoes or one large 
one cut in half (about one-half pound). Lay in a bed of light 
coals, cover with same, and smother with ashes. Do not disturb 
for 30 or 40 minutes, when they should be done. 

Onions, fried. — Same as potatoes fried. 

Canned tomatoes, stewed. — Pour into the mess pan one man's 
allowance of tomatoes (about one-fifth of a 2-pound can), add 
about two large hardtacks broken into small pieces, and let come 
to a boil. Add salt and pepper to taste, or a pinch of salt and 
one-fourth spoonful of sugar. 

Or, having fried the bacon, pour the tomatoes into the mess pan, 
the grease remaining, and add, if desired, two broken hardtacks. 
Set over a brisk fire and let come to a boil. 

Or, heat the tomatoes just as they come from the can, adding 
two pinches of salt and one-half spoonful of sugar, if desired.

for use in transit, without Alamo attachment. 

a baggage car. With this equipment the messing arrangements 
are similar to those when the standard kitchen cars are used. 

The following instructions are given for installing and disman- 
tling field range No. 1 and boiling plate in a baggage car. 



74 KAN1TAL FOR AKXCY COOKS. 

Construct a box 6 feet 8 inches long by 3J feet wide and about 12 
inches deep, inside measurements, using IJ or 2 inch material if 
available. Line the sides, ends, and top edge of the box with 
galvanized iron or zinc. Place the box in car, running length'wise 
on one side of the car, about 2 feet from the side. Fill box with 
dirt up to about 2 inches of the top. Place a brick flush with top 
of dirt at each of the foiu- comers where the range will set. Place 
range in box, front and oven end close up against end of box, 
and deep enough in box so that when oven door is opened it will 
lie flat on edge of box. Place boiling plate in box, the end resting 
on top of angle iron on rear of range. Place a brick under each 
front comer of boiling plate, flush with top of dirt. The Alamo 
attachment is not used when range No. 1 is installed in the above 
manner. 

Fasten ravage and boiling plate firmly to box by means of strap 
iron or two or three strands of telegraph or telephone wire, at 
points shown on figure. Fill space between range, boiling plate, 
and side of box with soft mud, to prevent heat fi'om escaping. 
Three and even four field ranges may be installed in a car. 

Remove one of the top ventilating windows from car; tack tent 
guards, furnished with each range, over the opening — one on the 
outside of the car and one on the inside. Carry stovepipe up and 
out through the opening. End of pipe should extend about 6 
inches outside of the ventilator opening. Elbow should be placed 
on end of pipe facing up and wired firmly to car. Wire stovepipe 
firmly to both sides of car. 

Box can be held firmly in position on floor of car by nailing 2 by 4 
inch strips around sides and ends of box. This is important and 
must not be neglected. 

The following additional equipment to that supplied with each 
range is necessary: 

2 G. I. water cans. 
2 G. I. buckets. 
1 elbow, stovepipe. 
100 feet wire. 

Water cans should be filled on every possible occasion where 
stops are made. 

If the equipment is to be set.up in a freight car, a hole will have to 
be cut in the top of car for the stovepipe, using tent guards as 
explained above, to cover the opening.

stituted for chili beans. 
111.- Ifam, boiled (for 100 men): 
Ingredients used — 
35 pounds ham. 
Wash and scrape the ham, removing any part that may be 
decayed. The water in which hams are cooked should never be 
allowed to reach the boiling point. Hams may be cooked five 
hours at 200° F. or seven hours at 180° F. Absolute cleanliness of 
meats, water, and cooking vessels must be the rule. Too much 
cooking and too little are both to be avoided. Place hams in 
near boiling water 5 or 10 minutes, after which reduce the water 
to a tepid temperature by the introduction of cold water, then 
heat to 180° F. and keep at that temperature until the hams are 
cooked. This process requires about 20 minutes to the pound. 
Hams thus cooked are practically steamed, as the moisture in the 
flesh is converted into vapor and the steaming process is taking 
place in the meat all the time. Skim all the impurities from the 
water as they arise. Let the hams cool in the water in which they 
are cooked.

where they will barely simmer. It may be necessary to add more 
water several times in the course of the momii^ (in order to keep 
the beans barely covered). By 10 o'clock in the morning there 
should be suflicient juice in the kettle, so that bubbles wUl rise 
to the surface as the beans simmer; in one-half hour the beans will 
be ready to serve and should be removed to a place where they 
will be kept warm. Serve hot with some kind of salad.

MANTJAX FOR ABIIY COOKS. 97 

To utilize left-over baked potatoes: 

Unless care is exercised in peebng these, a large portion of the 
potato will adhere to the skin. This may be avoided by boUing 
10 or 15 minutes and peeling at once. 

143. Potatoes, boiled (for 100 men): 
Ingredients used — • 

35 pounds potatoes.

Do not allow them to boU until broken, as this will cause them 
to absorb water and become pasty and soggy. Remove the kettle 
to back of stove, allowing the steam to escape. This will give 
them a sweet and nutty flavor. Keep hot until ready to serve. 
The cooking should be so regulated that they can be served imme- 
diately thereafter. 

145. Potatoes, fried (for 100 men): 
Ingredients used — 

35 pounds potatoes.

about 30 minutes. 

146. Potatoes, French fried (for 100 men): 
Ingredients used — 

35 pounds potatoes, peeled. 

Cut lengthwise into one-half inch slices and fry in deep lard 
until nicely browned; after frying, dust slightly with salt gmd 
serve hot with any kind of meat. 

On account of the quantity of potatoes to be prepared for an 
organization mess it is not advisable to cut in thin slices, as is 
usually done. This is a dish much relished by the men, and 
on account of its comparative cheapness it is recommended for 
frequent use.

it ie believed that a large amount of lard or other fat is required 
to fry them. Experiments have proven conclusively that, when 
considerable lard or fat is required to float them, a very small 
amount is actually consumed in frying. In recent experiments 
with pure lard it was found that only 10 oimces were used for 
frying 17 pounds of potatoes. One pound of refined cottonseed oil 
will fry 25 pounds of potatoes.

5 cans evaporated milk. 
8 pounds sugar. 
i ounce extract. 
Boil the rice for a few minutes and then strain through a sieve; 
add the eggs, cream, and sugar, with a pinch of salt and sufficient 
water to cover about one-half inch; bake slowly in the oven until 
slightly brown. The rice should not be overboiled, as the kernels 
should remain separate and firm. Serve with cold or hot sauce 
flavored with lemon. 



174. Potato j/eas«{l-gaUon mixture): 
Ingredients used — 

4 pounds potatoes. 
2 ounces sugar. 

1 ounce salt. 

4 ounces flour. 

2 ounces dried yeast. 

Clean potatoes thoroughly and boU until weU done. Place the 
sugar and flour in a clean wooden or earthenware receptacle. 
Strain the water from the potatoes into another vessel. Place the 
hot potatoes on top of the sugar and flour, mash them, and mix 
thoroughly. Add hot potato water, mix weU, and set aside to 
cool. Place dried yeast in 1 pint of cold water and soak. When 
the mixture is about the temperature of the hand, add the dried 
yeast and sufficient water to make 1 gallon. Mix thoroughly. Set 
in a temperature of about 85° F. to prove. 

This yeast will require approximately 10 hours to mature, de- 
pending on the temperature, and if after maturing it is kept in a 
temperature below 60° F. will keep for several days. 

175. STTiall dough (1-gallon mixture). — To make the sponge: 
Soak three yeast cakes in a pint of lukewarm water until soft (or 
use 1 pint of stock yeast prepared in the kitchen) and add two

inedium-sized potatoes which have been boiled until well done, 
and add enough lukewarm water to make one-half gallon. Make 
into a stiff batter by adding about 6 pounds of flour, and let rise 
and fall. When it has dropped about 1 inch, add sufficient water 
to make 1 gallon; make a dough by adding about 8 pounds of flour 
and the following ingredients:

> Where two or more quantities are glvea in the same column correspondingly 
large or small amounts should be used together. The richness of the product 
depends upon the quantities of such ingredients used. 

Note. — The temperature of the sponge, of the dough, Eind of the buns while 
proving should be as near to 80° F. as possible. ■ 

Let the dough rise to about three times its size, punch down, 
work over, and permit to rise to twice its original size. Then work 
into 1-pound loaves (round), weighing the dough on the scales, 
and let prove for about 15 or 20 minutes. Then, for small doughs, 
cut into 8 equal parts. This can best be done by rolling the proof 
ball or loaf, cut into a cylinder, dividing it in halves with the 
scraper, subdividing each half into halves, and then in a similar 
way subdividing again. The above recipe is sufficient for about 
180 buns or about 22 Jenny Linds. 

176. To handk a sponge in cold weather. — The temperature of the 
room, flour, and water should be such that the sponge, when com- 
pleted, will have a temperature of from 85° to 90° F. Place the 
sponge in a suitable vessel and the vessel in a fireless cooker. If 
one is not available select another vessel about 8 inches larger in 
diameter and 6 inches deeper; place cloths or sacks in the bottom 
of the larger vessel to a depth of 2 inches. Then put the vessel 
containing the sponge into the larger vessel and close the top of 
the smaller, packing cloths or sacks over the inner and outer 
vessels. Close the top of the outer vessel and put it in a warm 
place in the kitchen. The sponge, thus protected, will be sub-

jected to only a slight variation in temperature during the night. 
Dry hay, grass, or straw may be used in lieu of cloths or sacks. 
This arrangement is similar in action to a fiieless cooker and is 
especially recommended for camp.
