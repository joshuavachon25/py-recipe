PREFACE 



In the preparation of this volume we have sup- 
plemented our own experience by free use of tjie current 
literature in text-books and magazines. Since the na- 
ture of the book precludes extensive bibliographical 
references, we take this opportunity of acknowledging 
our indebtedness. To many of our colleagues on the 
staff of Michael Reese Hospital we owe debts of grati-* 
tude for suggestions and help; Dr. Joseph C. Friedman 
has given us much valuable assistance; the chapter on 
Diseases of the Heart was planned by Dr. Sidney 
Strauss; the one on Diseases of the Skin was outlined 
by Dr. Phillip P. Shaffner. The publishers have con- 
stantly extended courtesies for which we are sincerely 
thankful.

FOOD FOR THE SICK 



CHAPTER I. 
INTRODUCTION 

The conceptions behind this little book are ( i ) that 
the patient may justly demand more explicit instruc- 
tions in diet than he has hitherto received; (2) the 
physician needs a practical guide book for imparting 
such instructions, especially when the patient must rely 
on himself or his family for the preparation of his diet. 
It has seemed to us that many diseases in which food 
plays an important role in treatment do not progress 
favorably because of the inability of the patient to 
grasp in terms of the kitchen what the physician says 
in terms of the laboratory. A cook book does not fill 
this need any more than does an elaborate treatise on 
the science of dietetics, which many physicians find 
difficulty in mastering. 

As an example, the meaning of a "low-nitrogenous, 
salt- free diet" is rarely so clear that a patient with 
Bright's disease may leave an institution, where he has 
had an elaborate cure, with definite knowledge of what 
he is to eat in the future. He must either follow 
rather blindly the diet sheets of his cure, or ask 
for instructions which to be successful must go 
into questions of cause and effect, of food values, of 
building menus, of special cookery. In giving de- 

(II)

FOOD FOR TH^ SICK, 



tailed instructions the physician of to-day assumes a 
standard of intelligent co-operation with the patient 
which is far removed from the attitude of mystery too 
often adopted in discussions of diet and disease. One 
thing- is certain: Good results in treatment can not 
be attained as long- as food as a means of cure is 
shrouded in mystery, as long as the patient is ignorant 
of the fundamental principles of his cure; he must 
learn how to make the science of nutrition and the art 
of cooking work hand in hand for his good. 

Probably both physician and patient will ask: Can 
this be done with safety? The ph3'sician may doubt 
his own ability to impart implicit instructions, the 
patient may doubt his own intelligence. But to us the 
answer to these doubts has been found in the experi- 
ences in the past years acquired in the treatment nf 
diabetes mellitus. Where formerly we advised our 
patients in general terms, gave them diet lists and told 
them to report occasionally, in more recent days we 
have instructed our patient in the details of the dis- 
ease, tile relation of articles of diet to various eflFects; 
we have given him enough of the fundamental science 
to at least control his own case ; we have guided him 
through the intricacies of food values ; we have shown 
him how to figure equivalents; we have taken him or 
his wife through the diet kitchen — and on the whole 
have educated him to be our assistant rather than 
merely our blind follower. Now, if this revelation has 
been possible in the most diMcult of all dietary diseases, 
it ought to be possible in all diseases in which the diei 



i

feature is important. We believe that this is not only 
possible, but most desirable, and in our book we hope 
' to offer the bridge over which safe passage may be 
made from institutional treatment, with all its controls, 
to home treatment, with all its apparent dangers. 

Since this book is to be written for the perusal of 
physician and patient, it must be constructed from the 
patient's as well as from the physician's point of view, 
and written in language which the patient will be able 
to understand. At the same time, it must adhere to 
the strictest tenets of true science. But we shall 
avoid the mistake of confusing science with theory, and 
theory will be brought in only when absolutely neces- 
sary to prove a fact. For our purpose, we might 
imply by science the "knowing why", and by art the 
"knowing how'' of feeding. To know how to diet for 
obesity is not the same thing as to know why the diet 
is prescribed ; but we shall consider that we have not 
filled our piu*pose unless we can show both the "why" 
and the "how." 

The plan of the book, then, must be very definite. 
Each chapter will be devoted to a single subject, and 
we shall first discuss the disease or the condition in 
such a way as to make plain the reasons for the dietary 
rules which follow. Complete details of the diet will 
then be given, with instructions in preparing foods and 
many menus. The first chapter will be devoted to a 
description of the normal use of food, and to lessons 
in practical application of food tables in building any 
kind of special menus. The succeeding chapters on 



14 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 



disease will aim to be scientific and practical, and to 
be the means of assuring confidence to both physician 
and patient : to the physician the confidence which goes 
with an assurance that his instructions are in "black 
and white"; to the patient the confidence which goes 
with knowledge. 



CHAPTER II. 



FOOD AND ITS USES 

It is a fact that in many diseases diet has largely 
taken the place of medication, and for this reason too 
much stress cannot be laid upon the value of a knowl- 
edge of the different classes of foods and the role which 
they play in nutrition of the body. A very pertinent 
question then arises: What is food? Food is any- 
thing which, when taken into the body, is able to fur- 
nish heat or energy or material for repairing waste of 
the body and of building new tissue. 

No clear ideas of either the need or the regulation 
of diets in disease can be possible to one who has not 
some conception of the use of food by the normal in- 
dividual. The mere putting of food in the stomach 
through the mouth is only a preliminary step, but most 
of us do not stop to consider why we eat, why we 
select certain foods to form our normal day's diet, or 
what happens to the foods we do eat. By what pro- 
cesses are foods handled so that part leaves the body 
in the stools and part is used for the nourishment of 
its different parts? All these questions, and more, 
arise as soon as one attempts to study the reasons for 
diet in any special disease. 

Very briefly, then, the use of food by the body will 
be explained. The first step in this process is diges- 
tion, and by digestion is meant the preparation of food 
in the mouth, the stomach, and the intestines (the 

(IS) 



gastro-mtestinal canal), so that it can be taken up or 
absorbed by the blood and assimilated by the body. 
Let us take a piece of roast beef, for example. In the 
condition in which it is put into the mouth the body 
can not use roast beef for its needs, but by the time the 
digestive juices in the stomach and intestines have done 
their work the beef has been put in shape so that w^hat 
the body can use is easily taken up by the blood, while 
the portion of no use to the body is passed along as 
feces. 

After food has been digested and its titilizable por- 
tion has been assimilated by the body, it has two main 
duties to perform. One, and perhaps the most im- 
portant duty, is to furnish heat and energy to the body, 
in exactly the same way as coal furnishes the energy 
for a furnace or gasoline for an automobile. 

In the many activities of all kinds which fill a per- 
son's life he is constantly using energy. Every time 
a man walks or raises his arm he is performing work, 
and in this respect he is like all machines which must 
have fuel if they are to work, Tlie food a man eats 
supplies the fuel for his work, and the amount of fuel 
hfi needs will depend to a great extent on the amount 
of work he does. This, of course^ explains w^hy per- 
sons taking active exercise or doing an unusual amount 
of work have an increased appetite; the appetite being 
the signal that extra food is needed. 

But food has another duty to perform which is dif- 
ferent from supplying fuel to an engine. Unhke an 
engine, the human body can use its own parts as fuel 



FOOD AND If S USES. 



17 



and would soon burn up its own tissues if food were 
not supplied to replace what is lost in ordinary activi- 
ties. Everybody knows how in starvation and in cer- 
tain so-called wasting diseases the body loses weight. 
The reason the healthy body does not lose weight is 
that the food which has been digested and taken up by 
the blood can be and is used by the body to prevent 
and repair waste as it occurs. If no food is given, the 
body "eats" its own parts in order to furnish food for 
its activities, and there is considerable waste. But 
when foods of the proper sort are given, there is no 
need for this, and consequently there is very little waste. 
However, there is always some loss of the body, and 
this loss is supplied by certain elements in the food. 

In all steps by which the body uses food chemical 
reactions occur just as they do in a chemical labora- 
tory. Most of these are extremely complicated, and 
it is unnecessary to discuss them here. The formation 
of urine represents an important principle in the gen- 
eral chemistry of nutrition, and should be explained. 
We have already stated that food is taken up by the 
blood after digestion, and is in such shape that it can 
be used by the body for two main purposes : ( i ) to 
supply fuel energy; (2) to repair waste and build tis- 
sue. We have further said that all this is actually a 
complex chemical process. Now the blood, in addi- 
tion to carrying digested food to the body organs, 
takes away from these organs what is left after the 
chemical processes are finished; and this left-over ma- 
terial has to get out of the body. The blood carries 
2 



V 



fOOD FOR TH^ SrCK< 



this to the kidneys, where it is passed out of the body 
as urine. The urine, therefore, represents the residis 
of the chemical processes in the body, while the feces 
represents merely the actual part of the food which 
does not get out of the alimentary canal. The chem- 
ical end-products are passed in the urine in solution in 
water, which forms by far the largest amoimt of any 
urinary constituent. The water comes either from the 
water we drink or from the food. 

The name used to describe these chemical processes 
by which the body changes food and uses it is '^metab- 
olism," This is a general name, used to describe the 
breaking down of food and its rebuilding in the regular 
course of its use by the body. Diabetes is a disease 
of metabolism, because patients with diabetes can not 
use certain foods as a healthy person does, and as a 
result sugar appears in the urine. 

Following this brief review of the use of food by 
the human body, it is necessarj^ to interpret the mean- 
ing of certain tenns used in defining foods. 

The body is composed of certain cheniical elements, 
Some of the most important ones are carbon, hydro- 
gen, oxygen, nitrogen » iron, calcium, phosphorus and 
sulphur. As the body grows or is destroyed by life 
processes, these must be again supplied, according to 
tile demands of the body. These elements are sup- 
plied to the body by the food which we eat. In differ- 
ent foods we find different elements and different com- 
binations of elements. For instance, water is a com- 
bination of hydrogen and oxygen. 



) 



FOOD AND ITS USES. 



19 



Generally speaking, all foods are classified under 
five main groups or headings : ( i ) Water. (2) Pro- 
tein. (3) Fat. (4) Carbohydrate. (5) Mineral 
matter or salts. 

Practically all food substances contain water; some, 
such as vegetables, as much as 90 per cent. ; others, 
such as the cereals, a small amount. The other food 
groups are complex chemical compounds, which differ 
from each other in a specific chemical way. Yet it 
would be difficult to give understandable definitions in 
chemical terms, , and perhaps a better idea of what the 
names mean will be obtained by a citation of examples. 
Protein, for instance, is the substance forming the 
main part of meat of all kinds, including chicken and 
fish. The white of egg is almost pure protein. All 
proteins are characterized by the presence of the ele- 
ment nitrogen. Certain vegetables (the legumes), 
such as peas and beans, contain a somewhat high per- 
centage, but most vegetables contain only a negligible 
amount of protein. 

Carbohydrates are found mainly in "starchy" foods, 
such as all flour preparations, the cereals — like oatmeal, 
rice, farina. Sugar is a pure carbohydrate. Vege- 
tables contain a varying amount of carbohydrate ; some, 
such as asparagus, lettuce, tomatoes, having about 3 
per cent. ; others, such as corn or beans, running as 
high as 20 per cent. Potatoes are also a carbohydrate 
food, as most of the solid matter in potato is carbo- 
hydrate. The fruits, like the vegetables, contain car- 



20 



FOOD FOR m% SICK, 



bohydrate in different amounts, grape fruit being very 
low, plums and bananas very high. 

The meaning of fat is evident to all. and the most 
common fat used is butter, which is almost pure fat. 
Cream is often spoken of in tenns of percentage of 
butter fat as "i8 per cent, cream," "20 per cent cream." 
Also the fats in meat, the fat in bacon and pork are ap- 
parent examples of ''fat'* food. All oils, such as olive 
oil, cottonseed oil, are pure fats, and certain nuts are 
particularly rich in fat. 

All these food elements have definite purposes in 
the body. Most fofKls contain a certain amount of 
each kind (see below, page 22), and a well-regulated 
normal diet will contain the amounts of each neces- 
sary to maintain the body at its highest point of effi- 
ciency. The protein food makes up the repair loss, 
the waste of the body tissues. Graham Lusk^ says : 
'Trotein has one profierty out of all proportion to 
that possessed by the other food stuffs : it very largely 
increases the production of heat in the body. In- 
dividuals maintained on a low protein diet may suf- 
fer intensely from cold. A good piece of beefsteak or 
roast beef will put the heat production on a higher 
level, and a |)erson going out of doors on a cold day 
after a meal high in protein does not feel the cold. 
For the same reason, on a hot summer day, meat will 
be avoided," Carbohydrate is the main fuel of the 
bod\^ as it is readily burnt to form heat and energ\^ 
Fat is also burned, but is also used as storage ma-

21 



terial, and is laid up as body fat. Water is necessary 
to replace the water in the body which is constantly 
being lost. 

In addition to these most important groups is 
another, the mineral salts, or ash, which is absolutely 
necessary for growth, and which must be supplied 
properly to nourish certain parts of the body, as the 
bones, the teeth. The mineral salts are distinguished 
from the other food substances in that they are in- 
organic chemical compounds ; that is, they do not con- 
tain the element carbon. In growing children they 
are necessary for complete growth; without calcium 
(lime) the bones do not develop; in adult life they 
also play another role, the exact nature of which is 
not quite understood. Salt is the commonest min- 
eral used, and the craving for it by most healthy 
persons is an indication of its requirement by the 
body. Almost all foods contain small amounts of 
mineral salts, and a diet which contained none would 
not only be distasteful, but would sooner or later show 
its effect on the general condition of a person. 

These five groupings, known as food nutrients, then, 
form the most important divisions of food, and, as 
said before, are all necessary to a well-regulated diet. 

As we have said that one function of food is to 
furnish heat for the body, we are much interested in 
knowing the amount of heat which different foods 
will furnish, so that we can more wisely choose our 
food according to occupation, season, climate, etc. 
The heat value of different foods has been determined 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 



by an mstnimeiit called the calorimeter. A small 
amount of food, one gram, is placed in a ball-like ap- 
paratus and immersed in water. The food is burned 
by electricity and a thermometer registers the change 
in the temperature of the water caused by the burning 
of the food. The standard unit of heat production is 
the calorie. This is the amount of Iieat that is neces- 
sary to raise the temperature of one pound of water 
4** Experiments have proved that one gram of 
protein will produce 4.1 calories of heat; i gram of fat. 
9.3 calories; i gram of carbohydrate, 4.1 calories. 

The question which now naturally arises is how to 
tell the proportions of each food nutrient to be found 
in any paticular food. Fortunately, all this work has 
been done by analytical chemists, and the Department 
of Agriculture of the U. S. Government has issued 
Bulletins, which give complete analyses of most Amer- 
ican food stuifs. The two most valuable of these are 
Farmer's Bulletin, No. 28, which can be obtained by 
sending twelve cents to the Department of Agricul- 
ture, and Farmer's Bulletin, Xo, 142, which is in part 
copied here.

t Plain confectionery not containing nuts, fruit, or chocolate. 

t Such vegetables as potatoes, squash, beets, etc. , have a certain 
amount of inedible material, skin, seeds, etc. The amount varies with the 
method of preparing the vegetables, and can not be accurately estimat'Cd. 
The flgures given for refuse of vegetables, fruit, etc., are assumed to rep- 
resent approximately the amount of refuse in these foods as ordinarily 
prepared.

tCereal coffee. Infu- 
sion (1 part boiled

t Milk and shell. 

i The average of five analyses of cereal coffee grain is: Water 6.2. 
protein 13.3, fat 8.4, carbohydrates 72.6. and ash 4.6 per cent. Only a por- 
tion of the nutrients, however, enter into the infusion. The average in the 
table represents the available nutrients in the beverage. Infusions of 
genuine coffee and of tea like the above contain practically no nutrients. 



It only requires a little practice to learn Jiow to 
use this table. For example, it is interesting to know 
what an ordinary day's diet will contain. In Bul- 
letin No. 28 the differences between food as bought 
and as served on the table are given, for it is apparent 
that cooking will change the proportions of various 
substances in some foods. As an example, oatmeal 
when bought is dry, and when finally cooked it will 
take up so much water that one ounce of the dry roll- 
ed oats will make about ten ounces of "oatmeal" 
ready to eat. On the other hand, in broiling meat the 
heat causes the water in the meat to evaporate, so that 



28 



FOOD FOR THJ^ SICK, 



there will be less weight when it is ready to eat than 
when it was bought- In the **average" Food values 
given in the table the figures refer to the material as 
bough t^ so that in trying to use it we must consider 
the food in the condition in which it is bought. There- 
fore, in learning to use the table for figuring an or- 
dinary day's diet, the first thing to do is to put down 
on paper just w^hat is being eaten, then to weigh out 
the amount of food used. In weighing food it is 
much easier to work in terms of grams than in ounces, 
especially when percentages are to be reckoned. All 
that is necessary to know^ is that one ounce equals ap- 
proximately 30 grams, and one pound equals 480 
grams. If the scales weigh in ounces only, it is easy 
to change the ounce values to grams. 

Having weighed out the total amounts of the various 
foods eaten in a da}^ we can turn to the table to see 
what they contain in protein, fat, carbohydrate, and 
how many calories are furnished* In an ordinary diet 
we need not consider refuse, w^ater or ash (mineral 
salts). The Avater and salts usually take care of them- 
selves, because a person adds w-ater and table salt to 
his diet usually to suit his needs or tastes. The refuse 
is of more economic than dietary importance, since^ 
naturally, the more refuse one gets in his purchase of 
food, the less he gets to eat for his money. Using 
the diet below as a basis, we see that oatmeal con- 
tains 16.7 per cent, protein, 7.3 per cent, fat and 66.2 
per cent, carbohydrate (in its dried state )» and as 
the serving of oatmeal was made from one-half ounce

oats (15 grams), this amount would contain 16.7 
per cent, of 15 grams=2.5 grams protein; 7.3 per 
cen^. of 15=1 gram fat, and 66.2 per cent, of 15=9.9 
grams carbohydrate.

The caloric value of the food can be estimated in 
either one of two ways : (i) Kroni the last columns in 
the table, where the fuel value of each food is given; 
or (2) by adding the total protein, fat and carbo- 
hydrate in the diet and multiplying each by the speci* 
fic figures already explained. In using food tables 
for any work it is necessary to know that they give 
only approximate values, as foods may naturally vary 
considerably in the proportions they contain. A side 
of bacon left hanging in a butcher's shop on a warm 
day will lose water by evaporation, and will therefore 
contain a larger per cent, of solid matter than it did 
when it left the packers. Strawberries will take up 
water after a heavy rain; the amount of fat in a piece 
of beef will depend on the condition of the steer, and 
milk, of course, will vary a great deal, depending on 
the cow's food. 

Already some question as to what the term ^'normal 
diet'' means has doubtless arisen in the reader's mind. 



IfOOD AND ITS USES 3 1 

Scientists have prepared tables of standard weights 
which they have obtained by actual examination of 
many individuals. In the preparation of these tables, 
the height, weight, age and sex of the individual have 
been considered, and by means of many comparisons 
they have obtained results similar to the following : 

In the following table are given the estimated 
heights, weights and food requirement of an average 
man at diflferent ages, the figures for height and weight 
being based upon the data given by Hill for males of 
the Teutonic races. (Recent advances in Physiology 
and Biochemistry) :

Even with these tables we must know that every in- 
dividual of given weight, height and age cannot be 
given the same amount or the same kind of food. 
There are other important factors which influence body

needs. By far the most important of these is the ac- 
tivity of the individual, denoted by work and rest. 
The kind of work and tlie conditions under which the 
person works are of vast importance A person may 
do hght work, moderate work or work which demands 
severe muscular exertion. The amount of tissue de- 
stroyed in each case will vary greatly, so that one can 
readily see that the amount of food needed to replace 
the body waste must vary greatly. 

Standard dietaries to meet these conditions have 
also been prepared by different scientists. One method 
by which results have been obtained has been the selec- 
tion of different individuals, living under different con- 
ditions. All the food which these people have eaten 
has been analyzed and all the excreta from the body. 
In this way comparisons have been made between the 
weights of the individual at different times in order 
to determine whether the food taken into the body was 
equal to the daily w^aste of the body substance. 

Some of the standard daily dietaries suitable for a 
man of average weight and build doing moderate 
amount of muscular work are as follows:

A boy 15-16 requires .9 of the amount of food of a man at moder- 
ate work. 

A girl 15-16 requires .8 of the amount of food of a man at moder- 
ate work. 

A boy of 12 requires .7 of the amount of food of a man at moder- 
ate work. 

A girl 10-12 requires .6 of the amount of food of a man at moder- 
ate work. 

A child 6-9 requires .5 of the amount of food of a man at moder- 
ate work. 

A child 2-5 requires .4 of the amount of food of a man at moder- 
ate work. 

Mental work is also an important factor influencing 
the amount and the nature of the food required by an 
individual. As the person doing mental work does 
little or no muscular labor, body waste is not so great : 
therefore less food is needed to make good natural 
losses. For example, a clerk doing desk work may be 
well nourished on a diet yielding 2500 calories, while 
a blacksmith at hard labor would require 4500-5000 
calories to keep himself in good condition. 

Other factors which influence the food requirement 
are age and sex, climate and season, weight and build 
and personal idiosyncrasies or peculiarities. In all 
animal life the young demands food for growth as well 
as for repair, so we know that, relative to its weight, 
a child requires more food than an adult. Women re- 
quire less food than men, because as a rule they are 
smaller and their bodies contain more fat and less mus- 
cle than those of men relative to their weight, so we 
say that women need about .8 as much food as men 

under similar conditions.

^OOD f^OR TH^ SICK, 



In cold climates more fuel food is needed to keep 
body temperature normal. As the external tempera- 
ture decreases more food must be consumed, and it is 
better to increase the protein as it g'ives a greater 
amount of heat than other food nutrients. Seasons 
affect the food requirements more as to the kind than 
as to quantity of food which one needs. A diet rich in 
vegetable matters and relatively poor in proteins is bet- 
ter in sinmmer. 

The build and shape of the body is of more import- 
ance when computing its food requirements than the 
weight. The greater the surface of the body, the more 
heat is lost by radiation and more food is required to 
maintain body temperature. Thus a tall, thin man of 
a giv^en weight may require more food than a short, 
fat man of the same weight living under the same con- 
ditions. 

Personal pecuUarity plays a very important role in 
the diet requirement of different individuals living 
under identically the same external conditions. The 
nervous system of each regulates the utilization of 
food materials, and lx>dy waste varies accordingly. 
This teaches us that we cannot moke or fake any stand- 
ard dietary and attempt to apply it to all mdividiials 
Innng under simUar conditiotis. Every man is a sep- 
arate entity, in heahh and in disease, and this fact must 
always be borne in mind. However, this does not 
mean that we cannot make and use. with discretion, 
standard dietaries for people living under varying con- 
ditions. From these tables we can obtain valuable in-

formation which will enable us properly to balance our 
diet Quite as much harm can be done and is done by 
an improperly balanced diet as by a diet which is in- 
sufficient in food value. A diet too rich in fats may 
be ^conducive to certain diseased conditions of the 
body. A diet too low in food value may undermine 
the general health and thus be a predisposing factor 
for the development of certain diseases. Ignorance 
more than poverty is to blame for both of these 
conditions. A campaign to scatter easily available 
knowledge is needed to correct the evil. The poorer 
classes need to be taught food values and to be shown 
that just as good and nourishing a diet may be ob- 
tained from food relatively low in cost as from food 
representing a considerable outlay of money. The 
proper preparation and cooking of good nutritious 
foods cannot be overestimated, as many people in their 
ignorance throw out of the back door more than the 
wage earner can bring in at the front door. 

Here it is interesting to show some diets actually 
consumed by individuals of different countries and of 
different social ranks. These are selected from some 
of Atwater's tables, and most of them approach stand- 
ards very closely:

In planning the menu for a meal we do not limit 
our selection to one, two or three foods. We like va- 
riety for several reasons, to balance the diet, to tempt 
the appetite, and to aid digestion. For instance, we 
precede a heavy meal with a light soup, not for the 
dietetic value of the soup, for that is low ; but to stimu- 
late the appetite and flow of digestive juices, A pickle, 
relish or salad may be used as an appetizer, not because 
it is high in nutritive value, ahhough the value of each 
depends upon its nature. Monotony of diet will de- 
prive many people of appetite and will thus leave them 
in a poorly nourished condition in which they will be 
more susceptible to disease. Therefore it is a good 
thing to add to the daily dietary many harmless foods 
relatively low in food value because of the psychic as 
well as dietetic value which they possess.

Proper dieting for the sick depends a great deal on 
the ability of either the patient or some member of 
his family to use diet tables ; but when the principle of 
their use is once grasped, their application to the sick 
person is mainly a matter of common sense and arith- 
metic. Vague though our conceptions of the exact 
nature of the fundamental food groups may be, if we 
know what is wanted and why, it should be a simple 
matter to consult the table and plan a diet accordingly. 
If the physician wishes a typhoid fever patient to have 
a diet of high caloric value containing, say, 250 grams 
carbohydrate, 100 grams protein, and 200 grams fat, 
and also wants easily digested foods, he can work out 
from the tables a diet such as

The division of any diet into meals will be dependent 
to a great extent on the nature of the disease and the 
caprices of the patient's appetite ; but it is usually bet- 
ter to plan a day in detail, so that a routine can be 
established which will not be interfered with ; and one 
can be reasonably sure that the whole amount figured 
on will be taken. 

The obtaining of variety in menus is perhaps more 
important in disease than in health, since more rigid 
limits as to foods are placed on the sick person. In 
the following chapters dealing with various diseases 
the question of variety in foods will be discussed, both 
from the standpoint of the scientific requirements of 
the disease and from the standpoint of preparation. 



CHAPTER III. 



DIABETES MELLITUS 

Diabetes is a disease characterized by the appear- 
ance of sugar in the urine. Normally sugar is not 
found in urine by the common tests and its presence 
generally but not always means diabetes. The condi- 
tion of sugar in the urine is called "glycosuria": this 
is not always diabetes. Nowadays the diagnosis of 
true diabetes can easily be made, and no one having 
sugar in his urine can afford to go without consulting 
a physician. The sugar appears in the urine of a dia- 
betic because he is unable to use the carbohydrate of 
his diet, and part or all of it passes through the blood 
to the kidneys where it is excreted as sugar. As al- 
ready stated in the second chapter, the carbohydrates 
of ordinary food are found in sugars, in the so-called 
starchy foods such as bread, potatoes, cereals, in 
fruits and some vegetables; and as the sugar in the 
urine comes from these substances the logical way of 
treating diabetes would seem to be merely the exclu- 
sion from the diet of all such carbohydrate foods. But 
unfortunately the disease is not so simple as this even 
in its mildest stage, and one cannot remove all carbo- 
hydrate from the diet of a normal person without 
danger. If we take starchy foods away from a normal 
person a substance appears in the urine known, as ace- 
tone which indicates that the body is being poisoned. 
Now this poison comes from the fats in the food and will 

(41) 



?ooD roR The sick. 



usually b§ found if a healthy person eats no carbohy- 
drate food for even as short a time as 24 to 48 hours; 
and it appears because there is no carbohydrate to be 
burned. The oormal person who is not eating enough 
carbohydrate soon shows acetone, and the diabetic who 
is not using the carbohydrate he receives is in e^tactly 
the same position. Although the carbohydrate gets 
into the stomach, something is lacking in the body to 
make it of use, and it passes througli the body. Any 
one who knows anything about an automobile engine 
will see a ready comparison in ''carbureter troubles," 
A plentiful supply of gasoline is fed to the machine, 
but because the carbureter is not correctly performing 
its task of getting the "gas'' ready for the motor the 
machine balks and finally stops. So with the diabetic. 
When the obscure cause of the disease starts the body 
on its path of not using carbohydrate, the disease if 
untreated generally progresses and less carbohydrate is 
being used all the time. So that no matter how much 
starchy food a diabetic may eat he uses only a small 
portion of what he eats, and he is therefore in approxi- 
mately the same condition as the normal person who is 
getting no carbohydrate. If this keeps up long enough 
the dial set es becomes se\'ere and acetone may appear in 
the urine in the course of the disease. If all starchy 
foods are taken away from tlie diabetic, as was formerly 
done, it is true that the sugar may disappear, but at the 
same time acetone may appear in the urine, and the 
patient may show signs and symptoms of poisoning 
which are more dangerous than the presence of sugar. 



DIABETES MELUTUS. 



43 



That is the reason why the treatment of diabetes is not 
the simple matter of withdrawing carbohydrates. 

It has been said so far that diabetes is a disease char- 
acterized by sugar in the urine, but that other danger- 
ous substances (acetone bodies) may also be found 
The sugar comes from the carbohydrates of the food, 
and the acetone from the fats of the food; so that it 
can be seen that in diabetes two of the most import- 
ant food elements are or may be involved. But that 
is not all. The third important food division is pro- 
tein, and in quite a few cases of diabetes the sugar in 
the urine is made from the protein in the food or in 
the body tissues as well as from carbohydrate. It re- 
quires considerable skill and much careful analysis of 
both food and urine to determine in an individual case 
just how the food is behaving and just what abnormal 
constituents of the urine come from what source of 
food, but nowadays that is done as part of the treat- 
ment of every case, and it must be done if the patient 
is going to be able to assist the physician in taking care 
of himself. Usually better results are obtained if the 
patient is in an institution where the urine can be ex- 
amined every day, and where the patient can be care- 
fully controlled in every particular, which means diet, 
rest and exercise, drink, etc. ; and whenever this is pos- 
sible it will be found that a stay of from one to three 
weeks will be a tremendous saving all around. Also 
we want to enable the patient who may have oppor- 
tunity to take hospital treatment for a time, upon leav- 
ing the institution, to assist his physician in taking 



44 



rOOD FOR THI^ sick. 



care of him. But witli some patients this is not pos- 
sible, in which case the physician has to da the best he 
can, and with intelhgent co-operation by the patieni 
he can often achieve wonderfully good resuhs. 

In treating diabetes it must be understood at tht; 
outset that the aim of treatment is to get the urine 
free from sugar and free from acetone. The means 
of doing this vary with the individual case and with 
the severity of the disease. In the course of historv 
many so-called diabetic * 'cures" have been described, 
but it can safely be said that a specific diabetic cure 
has never been found. It is true that patients can be 
made free from sugar and acetone and then can eat 
a considerable amount of all kinds of food, but even 
these patients if they are real diabetics can not trans- 
gress certain limits which have been found for them. 
That is one of the strongest arguments for the mod- 
ern practice of telling a patient as much about his dis- 
ease as he can understand, and that is why we are go- 
ing into such details in this chapter. 

As we have already stated, the aim of treatment is 
to get the urine free from sugar and acetone. If 
acetone is not present Ave must aim to prevent its ap- 
pearance during treatment In the mildest cases of 
diabetes the sugar will disappear from the urine if we 
simply remove some of the carbohydrates from the 
diet, whereas in other cases it may be necessary to 
starve a patient completely. The best way to find out 
just what kind of a *'case" we are dealing with is to 
put the patient on a special diet in which every article 



DIABETES MEI.UTUS.

of food is known, and either weighed accurately or 
estimated approximately. Such a diet may be seen 
below :

This diet contains approximately 70 gms. protein, 
100 gms. fat and 70 gms. carbohydrate, and the pa- 
tient is kept on it for at least two days. Then the 
carbohydrate is cut down by taking away 25 gms. of 
bread every day. If the case is a mild one, the sugar 
will disappear and no acetone will appear, and then 
the first step of treatment will have been accomplished. 
The next step is to keep the urine clear for some days,

and then carbohydrate is added gradually in order to 
see how much the patient will use without siugar re- 
appearing. This is best done by again adding one 
ounce of bread a day until the patient is taking 4 or 
5 ounces. It is wise not to attempt to use more than 
one kind of starchy food at a time at this stage of 
treatment, but if the patient prefers potato or some 
cereal like oatmeal we can use either potato or oat- 
meal instead of bread. When we do we must remem- 
ber that 3 ounces of potato, or 9 ounces of cooked, oat- 
meal contain the same amount of carbohydrate as i 
ounce of bread, so that we can safely use 3 times as 
much potato or 9 times as much cooked oatmeal. If 
on the other hand the patient would like to eat more 
than one kind of carbohydrate food, we must find out 
whether he can do this without the appearance of sugar, 
as some patients can not "mix" their carbohydrate 
food. The best way of doing this is to substitute for 
the bread already in the diet equivalent amounts of 
potato or oatmeal. For instance, on the first day we 
can give 9 ounces of cooked oatmeal in place of one 
ounce of the bread, and the next day we can give 3 
ounces of potato instead of one ounce of bread. This 
method of testing equivalent foods is illustrated in 
some sample diets:

Of course the changes which can be run into such 
a diet are many. One must know just how much car- 
bohydrate the patient is receiving, and if it is desired 
to substitute some other foods all that is necessary is 
to consult the food tables. For this purpose the ar- 
rangement of foods into groups on the basis of the 
amount of carbohydrate they contain is very convenient 
and the table which Dr. Joslin has used is most con- 
venient.

In this little table the more common foods are all put 
down under the percentage of carbohydrate tliey con- 
tain; and it requires very simple arithmetic to learn to 
use it. For example any one of the gr^^^p can 
be substituted for the same amount of any other food 
in the groiip; only the anaount of any of the io^> 
group, and only 1/3 the amount of any in the 15'^*' 
group, howeven can be substituted for articles in the 
5% group. On the other hand if the patient wants 
to eat apples instead of bread all he has to know is 
that apples contain 15'^*' carlx>hydrate, while bread 
contains 60%, so that it will take 4 times as much 
apple as bread to yield the equivalent amount of carbo- 
hydrate in the food. He can then substitute for one 
ounce of bread 4 ounces of apple, which is the average 
weight of one ordinary sized apple. Such substitu- 
tions can be carried out in an almost indefinite manner, 
so that after the exact amount of carbohydrate which 
a patient can use is once determined menus of sur- 
prising variety can be served. 

Some examples of menus showing such possible sub- 
stitutions and the methods of making them are now 
shown, and at the end of the chapter will be found 
numerous more memis. The carbohydrate content o" 
the food for all three days is approximately 54 grams,

Unfortunately most cases of diabetes, unless they 
come for treatment very early in the disease, do not 
clear up as easily as the mild ones just described, and 
in such cases the procedure employed to make the urine 
free from sugar is different. Most of such patients 
already show acetone and diacetic acid in the urine, in 
which case a real danger may e.xist from further re- 
ducing the calxjhydrate of the food. All sorts of 
methods for treating such patients have been described, 
but need not be discussed in this book because it has 
been shown tliat the A'ery best thing to do for such pa- 
tients is to take all food away. It may sound strange 
to say that withdrawing the carlxihydrates and leaving 
the other foods may be dangerous, whereas withdrawal 
of all food will give good results, hut the experience 
of many years shows this to be true. 

But this star^-ation treatment can not be considered 
a simple procedure, and it must be carried out with the 
greatest care and always under the control of a physi- 
cian. The patient is confined to bed during the star- 



I 

i 



DIABETES MELUTUS. 



53 



vation days, and the physician makes daily examina- 
tions of the urine. In our opinion it is inadvisable 
suddenly to put a patient on starvation, and the physi- 
cian must determine in the individual case just when to 
take away all food. If the patient is put on the test 
diet already described on page 45 it may be found 
that he is not only showing sugar but a large amount 
of acetone bodies in the urine. In such a case it is prob- 
ably best to remove most of the fats before anything 
else is done. Then follow one or two days in which 
nothing but 3 or 4 eggs, 250 to 300 gms. (8-10 oz.) of 
^% vegetables are given, and as a rule starvation can 
follow safely. During the starvation nothing is given 
by mouth except water as much as wanted, coffee or 
tea without sugar or cream (6 ounces 3 times during 
the day), and in some cases 8-10 ounces of clear 
chicken or meat broth and whiskey }i ounce every 
3 hours. Starvation is kept up until the urine is free 
from sugar; some physicians have starved patients as 
long as 10 days. With the method we have just out- 
lined. 1-3 days' starvation is usually successful. 

Before discussing the treatment which follows we 
want to show actual diets used in reaching the starva- 
tion level. The two days test already described on 
page 45 were followed by the following diets :

Starvation until sugar-free urine is obtained. 

If by this method we have succeeded in making the 
urine free from sugar and acetone, we have accom- 
plished the same thing as w^e did with the milder cases 
by a simple withdrawal of carbohydrate. The patient 
is in relatively the same condition as the mild case, 
and is now ready to have food. When we give to 
this class of patients we must remember what was 
said earlier in this chapter about the possible dangers 
from protein and fat as well as from carbohydrate, so 
that we must add food very slowly and know exactly 
what we are giving. The principle to have in mind 
now is the gradual addition every day of compara- 



DIABETES MELUTUS. 55 



lively small amounts of food whose value in protein, 
fat and carbohydrate is known. The 5^^ vegetables, 
forming as they do a large bulk with small nourish- 
ment, are the first carbohydrate to be added, while the 
protein and fat are found in eggs. The following 
schedules of JosHn, with their explanatory notes, will 
give a good idea of how this part of the treatment is 
carried out. 

Fafltflnir* until sufpir-free. Drink water freely and tea* 
coffee and clear meat broth as desired. In very severe, long stand-" 
ing and complicated cases, without otherwise changing habits or 
diet, omit fat, after two days omit protein and halve carbohydrate 
daily to 10. grams, then fast. 

Carboliydr«te Toleranee. When the 24 hour urine is 
sugar-free, add 150 grams of 6 per cent, vegetables, and continue to 
add 6 grams carbohydrates daily up to 20, and then 6 grams every 
other day, passing successively upward through the 5, 10, and 
15 per cent, veeetaibles, 5 ana 10 per cent, fruits, potato and 
oatmeal to bread, unless sugar appears or the tolerance reaches 
3 grams carbohydrate per kilogram body weight. 

Protein Tolerance. When the urine has been sugar-free 
for 2 days, add 20 nams protein (3 eggs) and thereafter 15 grams 
protein daily in tine form of meat until the patient is receiving 

1 gram protein per kilogram body weight, or if the carbohydrate 
tolerance is iero, only ^ gram per kilogram body weight. 

Fat Tolerance. While testhig the protein tolerance, a 
small quantity of fat is included in the eggs and meat given. Add 
no more fat until the protein reaches 1 gram per kilogram (unless 
the protein tolerance ui below this figure) but then add 25 grams 
daily until the patient ceases to lose weight or receives not over 
40 calories per kilogram body weight. 

Reappearance of Sugar. The return of sugar demands 
fasting for m hours or until sugar-free. The diet is then increased 
twice as rapidly as before, but the carbohydrate should not exceed 
half the former tolerance until the urine has been sugar-free for 

2 weeks, and it should not then be increased more than 5 grams 
per week. 

Weekly Faiit Days. Whenever the tolerance is less than 
20 grams carbohydrate, fasting should be practised one day in 
seven; when the tolerance is oetween 20 and 60 grams carbo- 
hydrate, upon Uie weekly fast day 5 per cent vegeubles and one- 
half the usual quantity of protein and fat are allowed; when the 
tolerance is between 50 and 100 grams carbohydrate, the IQ and 15 
peir cent vegetables are added as well. If the tolerance is more 
than 100 grams carbohydrate, upon weekly fast days the carbo- 
hydrate should be halved.

FOOD FOR Tut SICK. 



If these additions are made slowly enough, in many 
cases considerable carbohydrate as well as protein and 
fat may he added, hut it is wel! to renieml>er that 
modern science has sho\\'n that it is most unwise to 
attempt to ''stuff" a patient as was formerly clone with 
protein or fat or both. The patient does not have to 
gain back his weight: it has been found that if he can 
comfortably live and perform his normal activities on 
less food than he is accustomed to his diabetes will be 
improved. 

If the patient has understood what has ]}een done 
for him up to this point he will easily be able to go 
home and continue the *'cure.*' The amount of each 
kind of food which is best for him having already 
been established, he can by a little study control his 
own diet. He should learn to test his own urine for 
sugar (the test is given at the end of this chapter) 
and should know what to do if sugar appears. We 
believe that the very l>est results in treatment can be 
attained if the patient lives on a scheduled diet. If 
Sunday is his accustomed heavy feeding day, lie should 
begin his week on Monday with a partial fast da v. 
This would include eggs, bacon, 5% and 10^'' vege- 
tables; the next day he takes his usual diet with only 
one half his limit of carbohydrate food; for instance, if 
he has been eating 4 ounces of bread or its equivalent in 
oatmeal or potato, he should on Tuesday eat only 2 
ounces. On Wednesda\^ he takes ^ and for the 
rest of the week lie can have his full quota of carlx>- 
hydrate.

During all this time he ought to lead a regular life 
in which exercise plays an important role. Every dia- 
betic patient, be it man, woman or child, will get along 
better after the treatment we have outlined if exercise, 
especially in the open air, becomes a regular part of the 
routine of living. If the diabetic is accustomed to al- 
cholic drinks a glass of Rhine or Moselle wine, or a 
high-ball with dinner may help his digestion, but beer, 
champagne and all sweet wines are strictly forbidden. 

The condition of the diabetic may change from time 
to time, so that during the home treatment sugar may 
appear in the urine without a definite reason. When- 
ever sugar appears it is a signal to cut down the carbo- 
hydrates, and the best way to do this is by a fast day 
which usually will cause the sugar to disappear. Then 
if the gradual addition of cabohydrates be practised 
as we have just advised, it is easy to find out how much 
carbohydrate may be safely added to the diet before 
sugar appears. Then, of course, no more than this 
amount should be taken. On the other hand, many 



6o 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 



patients find that after some time they can eat more 
carbohydrate than their allowance, which means that 
the treatment has improved the condition ; and in such 
cases it is usually safe to allow the extra amount. But 
even with the improved patients we believe that the 
gradual schedule of food should be followed and that 
the chances for a continuation of improvement are 
greater if such a schedule is used.

Haines' Test for Sugar in the Urine. 

Haines' test is chosen because it seems to offer 
greater ease of perfonnance and less chance of error in 
interpretation than other tests. 

The solution contains: Pure copper sulphate 30 
grains, distilled water oz. Dissolve the copper in 
the water; add pure glycerin J/^ oz. Mix thoroughly 
and ^ add liquor potassae 5 oz. 

Put about one teaspoonful of this solution in a test 
tube, boil gently over an alcohol or Bunsen burner, add 
6 to 8 drops of urine, and again bring to a boil. The 
presence of sugar is indicated by a yellow or yellow-red 
precipitate. 



CHAPTER IV. 



GOUT 

Gout is a definite disease, with definite symptoms, 
characteristic blood and urinary findings and a fairly 
well defined course. Gout is an inflammation of the 
joints, associated with or caused by a retention of uric 
acid in the blood, and, except in the beginning of an 
acute attack, lessened excretion in the urine. As a 
rule in true gout there is a deposit of the sodium salt 
or uric acid somewhere in the body — the lobe of an 
ear, the joint itself, over the elbow, in front of the 
knee — a chalky white deposit with a characteristic ap- 
pearance under the microscope. 

These words picture true gout, which, although 
comparatively rare in this country, may be seen when 
looked for. Many other conditions have unfortu- 
nately been associated with gout — under the name 
"goutiness,'' "uric acid diathesis,*' etc., but at the 
present time such a grouping is unwise and mislead- 
ing. The urine of many persons will on standing pre- 
cipitate a large amount of uric acid or its salts, but 
this is not gout and in no way related to it. "An ex- 
cess of uric acid" often reported in urine analyses 
usually means a physical-chemical change in the 
urine, and is quite different from the small amount 
usually excreted in gout. 

The uric acid which is retained in the blood stream 
in gout is derived from two sources: i, protein food 
' (97) 



rich in nuclei — the niicleo-proteins [exogenous uric 
add] ; 2, destruction of cells in the body [endogenous 
uric acid]. These nucleo-proteins, whether they origi- 
nate from the food or from tlie constant cell destruc- 
tion occurring during normal life, are called the 
'*purin bodies." The difference between a normal 
and a gouty person is this: purin bodies are taken 
with food by both, and also arise from normal body 
activity in both, but a normal person excretes his ex- 
cess, whereas the gouty person can not excrete his. 
and it remains in the blood. 

The treatment of gout can be considered under two 
main headings: (i), prevent the formation of uric 
acid; (2), facilitate its elimination. Since uric acid 
arises from two sources the exogenous (food) and en- 
dogenous (cell destruction), and since it is obviously 
more difficult to control cell activity than the food in- 
take, the necessity of careful dietary regulation is at 
once apparent. The traditional association of gout 
with high livers and drinkers is of course based on 
facts. Excessive eating really means a potential in- 
crease in the uric acid precursors from cell destruc- 
tion as well as an actual increase from external sources ; 
for it has been shown that excessive work put upon 
the digestive glands causes an increased formation of 
endogenous uric acid. 

The food of a gouty patient must be regulated from 
every direction^ — quantity, quality and habits of eat- 
ing. Not only must the purin metabolism be con- 
sidered, but in many instances careful attention must 



GOUT. 



99 



be paid to the carbohydrates, for gouty individuals 
often show glycosuria; to the kidneys which not in- 
frequently are affected; and to the weight of the pa- 
tient, for obesity should be avoided. The best results 
in treating a gouty patient would be obtained in an 
institution where the patient can be "tested out'* just 
as a diabetic is tested, and where a tolerance limit for 
purins can be established. 

During an acute attack of gout a "purin-free diet,'* 
such as Chace recommends, can be given. 

Breakfast: Apple or banana, cream of wheat or fa- 
rina with cream and sugar, one egg, cup of cereal cof- 
fee with cream and sugar, toast and butter. 

Dinner: One egg, baked potato with butter, string 
beans, rice or macaroni, baked apple with sugar, a glass 
of milk. 

Supper: Rice with butter, cream cheese, bread and 
butter, stewed pears, rice pudding. 

The diet for chronic gout must be well balanced 
and should maintain the patient's strength. For a man 
weighing 150 lbs. Chace recommends 70 gms. of pro- 
tein (mainly vegetable), 200 gms. carbohydrate, 150 
gms. fat (2500 calories). The purin content of 
the various foods should be understood and the fol- 
lowing table from Walker Hall gives the purin con- 
tent of some commoner foods.

There is no essential difference in the purin con- 
tent of the different meats, chicken or fish ; certain of 
the vegetables are purin free, others contain varying 
amounts. Of drinks tea, coffee and cocoa are especially 
rich in purins. Whiskey drinkers are not prone to 
gout, but beer drinkers are, and although the percen- 
tage of purin in beer seems small, a heavy beer drinker 
will consume large amounts in a day. Certain other 
points should be remembered. Meats which are boiled 
contain less uric acid precursors than roast meats. Al- 
cohol, even in the purin-free beverages, should be used 
only as a necessary stimulant. All condiments, certain 
fruits, as strawberries, oranges, cucumbers, should not 
be used. 

Salt should be used sparingly as it tends to cause a 
deposit of sodium urates. Water, especially the saline 
mineral types, has a special use in assisting elimination, 
but alkalies and alkali waters may cause the deposit of 
urates and should be avoided.

The essential element in the treatnient of gout is in- 
dividualization of the patient. The remote causes are 
as important as the uric acid metabolism. Poor habits 
of living should be corrected, a sedentary life ought to 
be replaced by mikl exercise or massage. Excesses of 
alcohol or of eating must be replaced by moderation. 
Certain occupations, such as working with lead, seem 
to predispose to gout, and tt would be folly to diet a 
lead worker and allow him to continue his dangerous 
trade.

CHAPTER V. 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY 
ACUTE NEPHRITIS 

In acute nephritis the kidney tissue is damaged by 
inflammation from bacterial or Other poison so that it 
is unable to perform its usual functions. The symp- 
toms arising in acute nephritis are in part due to the 
damming back into the body of those products of the 
body chemistry (metabolism) which normally are 
passed by the kidney from the blood into the ureters. 
Since little or no urin6 is passed in this condition, 
such products of metabolism enter the general circula- 
tion, and the symptoms of uraemia or of edema de- 
velop as a result. Whether, as has been generally ac- 
cepted, the uremic symptoms are due to the reten- 
tion of products of nitrogen metabolism and edema 
to retention of salts or water, or both; or whether 
Fischer's theory, that the symptoms are referable to 
the acidifying of the kidneys and the tissues, be cor- 
rect cannot be discussed in these pages, although the 
practical application of both conceptions, as applied to 
the dietetic management of the disease, will be thor- 
oughly considered. 

Using as a basis of treatment the same rational 
procedure which would be applied to the treatment of 
an infected finger, we should first of all as nearly as 
possible allow the kidneys an opportunity to attain 

(los) 



io6 



I^OOD I^OR the; sick. 



functional rest. The accomplishment of this aim 
would be easy enough were it not for the fact that 
kidney rest is incompatible with normal body function : 
the kidneys must get rid of the toxic metabolic pro- 
ducts constantly being formed in ordinary body econ- 
omy. Some of these substances seem to have a harm- 
ful eflfect on the damaged kidney itself. Therefore, 
since complete functional rest is impossible and since 
certain products of metabolism are more harmful than 
others, we have to select a path to which the kidneys 
offer least resistance; in other words, we have to try 
to bring to the kidney substances which in their pas- 
sage are the least harmful to it. 

While there are no means of actually testing which 
substances harm the kidney, there is much evidence to 
prove retention of certain substances. The presence 
of edema shows water retention, which, however, may 
not necessarily be primary ; the small amount of sodium 
chloride excreted in the urine proves that sodium chlo- 
ride is retained ; and the quantitative determination of 
non-protein nitrogen or of urea in the blood indicates 
that nitrogenous end products do not pass through the 
kidneys in a normal manner. Water, salt and nitro- 
gen are all food elements, so that the role food plays 
in the management of such a case seems apparent ; and 
the effort to secure a suitable diet in nephritis, either 
acute or chronic, is one of the most important, if not 
the most important element in its therapeutics. Food 
must be selected so that the end products of its metab- 
olism are as far as possible "bland'' substances with 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. 



107 



regard to the kidney tissue; and especial attention must 
be paid to the nitrogen, salt and water content. The 
reason milk has formed the basis of most "cures" of 
acute nephritis is that ( i ) milk contains a small salt 
content; (2) the protein element in milk is not only 
small, but it is of such a nature that the end-products 
of its metabolism are comparatively non-toxic; (3) 
the water content is exactly known, and (4) it is 
easily digested. One great trouble with milk as an 
ideal food is that too large amounts are needed to sup- 
ply enough calories for the nourishment of the body 
without flooding the body with an excess of water. 

In the most acute stage of nephritis perhaps the best 
way to attain functional renal rest is to give nothing 
to eat and to allow only water in limited amounts to 
enter the body. Plain or carbonated water by mouth, 
ice pellets, or even water per rectum are allowed ; but 
how much each patient should receive must be deter- 
mined for the individual patient by carefully balanc- 
ing the amount of urine voided and the extent of 
edema against the symptoms of uraemia. If the kid- 
neys are secreting any urine at all, somewhat more 
water should be allowed in the 24 hours than is void- 
ed, because water itself is a good diuretic and prob- 
ably helps "flush" retained poisons through the kidney. 
The intense thirst of this period may be allayed by the 
addition of cream of tartar and lemon juice to the 
water, which makes a pleasant slightly diuretic drink.* 

• To one pint boiling waKr add 1 dram of cream of tartar, the Juice of 
% lemon and a little sugar. 



io8 ?ooD i^OR the: sick. 

How long to maintain a patient merely on water will 
naturally depend almost entirely on his reaction to 
treatment. If he is going to react at all, two or three 
days at most should suffice, and then milk can be 
added. 600-900 cc. (20 to 30 oz.) of milk will fur- 
nish as much water as tlie body can w^ell handle at this 
stage, and the additional nourishment can be supplied 
by other non-irritating bland foods, provided of course 
the patient is able to eat at all. Such substances as 
the cereals, poor in salts and protein, dry toast, 
potato, lactose, and, if digestion is not too impaired, 
sakless butter will add extra calories; and the citrous 
vegetables well prepared seem to have a good effect. 
Such a diet is the so-called salt-free "non-nitrogenous" 
and has a limited water content, and therefore it com- 
bines the principles of the most accepted "cures." 

Some specimen menus of such a diet as used by us 
with analyses are here shown:

This cure is usually begun by giving 3 to 6 oz. of 
milk three or four times a day. Gradually the amount 
given and the number of feedings is increased until 
the patient is getting about 2 qts. daily. The milk 
may be given plain but is usually diluted with some 
alkaline mineral water, as lime water. In the summer 
the milk is given at room temperature, and in winter

H must be warmed. If the stools remain solid after 
one week of strict milk diet the amount given is in- 
creased to 2 qts daily. If gastric disturbances and 
diarrhoea result, it is certain that the milk is being im- 
properly digested, and the amount should be tempora- 
rily decreased. If constipation result, this is a sign 
that the milk is agreeing and is being well utilized by 
the individual, and laxatives and enemeta may be used. 
This condition may also be overcome to some extent 
by diluting the morning portion of milk with small 
amounts of coffee and by adding baked apple or prunes 
to the afternoon's diet. If patient complains of thirst, 
feedings may be diluted with plain hot water j carbonat- 
ed water or lime water. If the desire for food is too 
great to be withstood, herring or stale salt free bread 
in small amounts may be added, and milk soup thick* 
ened with cereal may be given once a week. This 
cure is usually given for five or six weeks and then a 
normal diet is gradually resumed, large quantities of 
milk still being taken. 

Martin Fischer has advanced an hypothesis of 
nephritis based on physical-chemical laws. According 
to his conception the symptoms of nephritis are due to 
an acidifying of the tissues of the body with a subse- 
quent osmosis of water. Edema is due not to salt or 
water retention by the kidneys, but to a disturbance 
of the general chemical reaction of the tissues which* 
becoming acid, take up water according to the laws of 
colloids ; uraemia is the result of the same condition in 
the brain. If this conception is correct, the treatment 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. 



Ill 



outlined by us is incorrect, and Fischer does use a 
treatment based on his theory. Instead of limiting salt 
and water intake, he injects into the circulation or 
through the rectum a large quantity of his solution : 

Sodium carbonate (pure crystals) 14 

Sodium chloride 10 

Distilled water 1000 

The salts in this solution reaching the tissues change 
their chemical reaction, osmosis is reversed, water is 
withdrawn from the tissues, including the kidney, and 
free diuresis results. 

In clinical practice divergent results have been re- 
ported from the use of Fischer's solution. It is rather 
difficult to reconcile such a radical departure from 
clinical practice — a practice with at times brilliant re- 
sults, and we have been loath to employ it generally. 
In certain cases where anuria or a marked decrease in 
urinary secretion persisted, Fischer's solution given 
per rectum has seemed to have a beneficial result, but 
in other cases no particular advantage over the therapy 
already outlined could be noted. 

CHRONIC NEPHRITIS 

Since acute nephritis is very likely to develop into 
chronic nephritis or to occur as an exacerbation of 
chronic nephritis, it is logical to continue our dietary 
discussion of chronic nephritis along the lines already 
outlined. Assuming that the acute stage is gradually 
passing and that the patient is reaching a condition in 
which his kidneys have partially regained the power to 



ri2 



TOOD I^OR TH^ SICK. 



functionate, onr method of treating will be corres- 
pondingly chang^ed to meet the increased functioning 
power of the kidney. As the symptoms of uremic 
poisoning or the edema subside, the additions to the diet 
must be based not on theory or on generahzation, but 
entirely on the reaction of the individual patient. For 
example J Mr. P. recovered from an acute nephritis 
with a complete disappearance of uremic symptoms 
but with a persistent edema, and in his diet we care- 
fully avoided increasing salt or water, but allowed the 
gradual addition of carbohydrates, fats, and even a 
small amount of protein for days before the edema dis- 
appeared, when we carefully added salt and water to 
the diet. 

Another patient showing a different effect was Mr, 
X,, in whom the acute stage subsided and all signs of 
edema and uremia disappeared. This man was kept 
on a low salt, low protein diet for a long time; his 
urine was clearing up but he did not feel up to stand- 
ard and remained anemic. Thinking that perhaps 
some of his symptoms were due to the absence of pro- 
tein in the diet, we slowly added meat until his total 
protein intake was 60 grams. Almost immediately 
there was a marked general improvement in his con- 
dition without any signs of increased renal disturb- 
ance. This probably means that in this particular case 
the kidneys were not harmed by products of protein 
metabolism, but on the contrary they needed, as did 
the rest of the body, the elements of nutrition which 
protein alone can furnish. 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. II3 



Owing to the confusion which exists regarding the 
proper classification of the chronic nephritides we have 
so far avoided the use of the older pathological terms, 
which post mortem experience has shown are of no 
great service in the therapeutics of the disease. As a 
matter of fact, all modern studies have attempted to 
classify nephritis on the basis of function, and many 
schemes have been devised to discover in the individual 
patient just what his kidneys can do. Although many 
of these functional tests have as yet not passed beyond 
the stage of academic interest, no discussion of diet in 
chronic nephritis would be complete without mention 
of the test diets of Hedinger and Schlayer and Mosen- 
thal. By application of a meal known to contain 
definite amounts of so-called diuretic substances and 
careful urinalysis, it is hoped that the particular fun- 
tion of the kidney which is harmed will be demon- 
strated, so that logical dietetic procedures for the par- 
ticular case can be determined. The test, as modified 
by Mosenthal and as used by us in detail, is :

The urine is collected at two hour intervals during 
the day, and all of the night urine is saved separately. 
The amount and the specific gravity of each specimen 
is measured, the sodium chloride and nitrogen are de- 
termined on the grouped day specimens and on the 
night specimen. 

Unfortunately it is not always a simple matter to 
interpret the findings from such a test so that they 
can be made of value in prescribing a diet; and from 
our standpoint it seems best at present to adopt some 
other standard. Although, as stated above, the divis- 
ion of cases of chronic nephritis on an anatomical 
basis of parenchymatous and interstitial nephritis is no 
longer warranted, from the standpoint of therapeutics 
we can well group the symptoms supposedly associated 
with the one type or the other and build our menus for 
the symptoms. Obviously a case of nephritis with 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. II5 

marked edema and no signs of uremic poisoning is 
treated differently from one with symptoms of intoxi- 
cation and lio edema; and the plan of diet would vary 
also. 

Now it is a clinical fact that we see most cases of 
chronic "parenchymatous nephritis'' as a sequel to an 
acute attack, so that the diet for this type logically 
can be continued where we left off the discussion of 
acute nephritis. The diet then would have to be fixed 
almost entirely by the course of the disease. With a 
patient rapidly recovering from his symptoms we can 
rapidly increase his diet, bearing in mind always (i) 
the limitations of his renal function; (2) the neces- 
sity of supplying sufficient calories properly to nour- 
ish the body; (3) the prevention of undue strain at 
any particular time. The choice of foods for such a 
patient is large, and the table given later (page 128) 
can be consulted. Even though there be no consid- 
erable evidence of protein intoxication, it must be 
borne in mind that there is probably no pwre type of 
renal disease, and that all those foods whose metab- 
olic end-products might damage the kidneys must 
be carefully considered. On this basis we would 
limit the protein to a minimum compatible with 
health and a fueling of well-being, and in no case 
of nephritis ought we allow more than 60-70 gms. 
protein. We have seen several patients whose gen- 
eral as well as renal condition showed definite im- 
provement after protein had been added to a diet main- 
tained too long on a very low nitrogen basis. 



ii6 



^OOD FOR TH^ SICK. 



This leads naturally to a discussion of the relative 
toxicity of different kinds of protein food. What may 
well be called a "traditional prejudice*' against red- 
meats in favor of fish or chicken is certainly not found- 
ed on scientific or clinical experiments and is based on 
the conception that the ^'extractive" content of red- 
meats is poisonous. It is true that beef-extract, be- 
ing rich in purins, is harmful, but it is likewise true that 
thorough cooking of meat destroys the toxic proper- 
ties of its extractives. From any other standpoint the 
protein of meat is the same as the protein of fish or 
chicken, and we see no reason why a patient may not 
have a well-done steak if he prefers it to a chicken, 
and in the same ainount he would have of chicken. 
This does not take into consideration the * 'relati ve di- 
gestibility" of meat as compared to fish or chicken, 
which is merely a general question of feeding to an in- 
valid and must not be confused with renal function. 
Naturally any sick man or woman should be given a 
tray of food which is tasteful and easy to digest, and 
as a rule the convalescent from any illness can more 
easily tackle a soft fish or the meat of a chicken than he 
can a well-done piece of roast beef. As a matter of 
practical cookery most individuals do not care for well- 
done red meat unless the native taste of the meat is 
either not **ruined*' by the fire or is supplanted by high 
seasoning certainly contra-indicated in nephritis. 

Ordinary stock soups are a very weak solution of 
beef extract flavored with salt and other seasonings, 
with a very high %vater content, relatively high content 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. 



117 



in substances toxic to the kidney (extract, salt, season- 
ings) and an extremely small caloric value. Stock 
soups, therefore, outlaw themselves at once from the 
dietetic scheme of nephritis. A solution of toxic sub- 
stances inta medium itself not without danger is by no 
means an ideal food. So-called "cream soups,'' how- 
ever, call for an entirely different comment. Made 
with milk, cream, flour or any combination of these 
three, flavored with vegetables allowed in the nephritis 
dietary, cream soups form a palatable, digestible and 
high caloric introduction to a meal. Vegetables, ex- 
cept legumes high in nitrogen seem to have a particu- 
lar field, possibly on account of their alkaline diuretic 
action. The legumes, being high in protein, must be 
considered under the class of proteins. All the carbo- 
hydrates and fat foods may be employed with safety 
as far as their toxicity to the kidney is concerned ; but 
since the digestion of these patients may be impaired, 
attention to palatability and digestibility will caution 
against excessive use of any food. 

The preparation and seasoning of food for the 
nephritic patient is just as important as the choice of 
foods to be used. It is very easy to deprive good foods 
of their dietetic value by improper preparation and by 
using condiments for seasoning which are harmful to 
the patient. Salt is the only condiment which should 
be used, and it should be used very sparingly. In some 
cases, when salt is poorly excreted, it is necessary to 
forbid its use entirely. In these cases the prepared 
"celery salt" or "onion salt" may be used when needed 



for seasoning. Fried foods should 7iever be used as 
food; the browned outer surfaces, saturated with 
grease, are harmful to both sick and well. Spices^ 
strong acids, alcoholic beverages, tea and coffee should 
be avoided, as they are irritating to the kidntys. 

Bearing in mind not only the qualitative limitations 
of food in nephritis, but also the fact that excessive 
quantities of any food at a given time are likely to 
make too severe a strain on the renal reserve, the ne- 
phritic menu should of necessity consider both the kind 
of food and the time it is served. It is well to use 
the five-meal day, making the 3 main meals less ^'heavy'* 
than normal and adding between-meal lunches. In 
this way the burden of elimination is spread through 
the day. Menus based on the principles we have just 
outlined and used with some of our nephritic patients 
are now shown.

CHRONIC "INTERSTITIAL" NEPHRITIS 

This is the name usually given to the condition gen- 
erally coming on insidiously with a somewhat vague 
group of symptoms, associated usually with high blood 
pressure, cardiac symptoms and with a urine charac- 
terized by its low specific gravity, a mere trace of al-

bumen, a few casts and often increased excretion, A!- 
thou^h as stated above '"pure" types of nephritis are 
uncommon, edema is rarely found in this class of pa- 
tients. On the contrary, careful lalxjratory studies of 
blood and urine show in the circulating bood an in- 
crease of urea and other nitrog^enous end products, 
whereas salt and water metaboHsm is not essentially 
disturbed. In these patients, then, the diet need not 
consider salt or water, but must embrace the protein 
and energy factors. This is particularly the kidney 
disease in which functional studies have shown an in- 
ability of the kidneys to pass a concentrated urine; the 
kidney has no reserve energy and therefore can not 
meet extra demands. The amount of solids excreted 
as represented by the specific gravit}^ is fairly constant 
clay and night, and practically never reaches as high a 
percentage as is found with normal kidneys. This 
probably is the reason for the increased excretion of 
water 

This disease is almost invariably associated with 
high blood pressure, and later in its course with car- 
diac complications. The question as to whether high 
blood pressure may occur without such a disturbance of 
the kidney has not yet been definitely settled, so that 
high blood pressure as part of the disease chronic in- 
terstitial nepbritis may be different from high bloods 
pressure in other conditions. See page 143. 

The symptoms of this type of chronic Bright 's 
disease may be obscure and elusive, and it is not al- 
ways the easiest disease to diagnose. The patient may

complain merely of slight headache, or of lassitude, or 
he may have stomach disturbances, or notice that he 
has to get up at night to urinate, or he may even not 
notice any symptoms until life insurance examination 
shows the trace of albumen and the casts, or perhaps 
the high blood pressure. He may not even know he 
is sick until some sudden strain results in an attack of 
apoplexy. 

Obviously then the treatment in this condition will 
depend on the stage at which the patient applies for 
medical treatment. If the diagnosis is made early, 
before any serious damage is done, the diet, like the 
rest of the treatment, must be aimed at preventing com- 
plications. The course usually followed is to order the 
patient to lower the tension at which he works, to 
work less and sleep more ; to eliminate from his day's 
routine things which are not necessary — in other words 
'*to take things easy." As far as diet is concerned, it 
seems to us far more important to restrict the amount 
taken than to over emphasize the harmfulness of any 
particular articles of food. Heavy meals which mean 
w^ork for all the organs of the body are contra-indicated, 
and the patient is ordered to leave the table before his 
appetite is completely satisfied. If he is hungry be- 
tween meals light luncheons of milk, or buttermilk and 
crackers or toast are allowed. 

Although we do not know the actual harmful effects 
of various foods in this condition we do have clinical 
and experimental evidence of the toxic action of some 
foods, as has already been explained in previous dis- 



124 



FOOD FOR Tut SICK. 



cussion. The avoidance of uraemic symptoms can per- 
haps be helped by restriction of nitrogenous foods, and 
the discussion of such foods in the earlier portion of 
this chapter applies with equal force here. It is very 
doubtful, however, if complete restriction of animal 
protein is good practice when a disease is of long" 
standing and the patient is likely to be engaged in 
normal pursuits which demand a rather liberal diet. 
Judgment must be exercised to balance the effect of 
articles of food, but excessive use of any food is always 
contra-indicated. Likewise restriction of certain arti- 
cles of diet frequently found in a normal man's bill of 
fare, such as any kind of fried food, highly seasoned or 
rich food, pastries, should be insisted upon; these 
things are not necessary and may be harmful. 

As a basis we give menus for such a patient for 
seven days, which will show what restrictions are 
necessary, and how great is the variety from which to 
pick a suitable diet.

If the disease has progressed so far as to show signs 
of so-called uraemic poisoning, the diet, like the rest of 
the treatment, must be more rigid, and if frank uraemia 
is present the treatment will be different. Uraemic indi- 
cations call for vigilant attempts to rest the kidney and 
to eliminate accumulated poisons through channels 
other than the kidney. Rest in Bed, purgation, sweats 
all have this object in view, and the diet must try to 
adhere to the principles laid down at the beginning of 
this chapter. The one exception — water — is founded 
on the physiological-chemical conception of uremias. 
One type, rather rare, is associated with general edema 
and is probably due to edema of the brain. When 
uraemic symptoms occur with generalized edema we 
know of no better dietary regime than the one already 
planned for the treatment of acute nephritis. The 
uraemia may, however, be due to one of two other 
causes: (a) retention of urinary products, (b) a toxin 
produced by the renal disease. In either one of these 
types — the commonest met with in practice — restriction

of water is not only not indkated, but in the use of 
water we have one of the mildest and most efficient 
diuretics known. If there be an accumulation in the 
body of some substances poisonous to the body, and 
if such substance can be "washed out'' with water, we 
should certainly attempt to do so. In case of an ac- 
companying cardiac complication the use of water 
must be restricted merely because of the mechanical 
inability of the heart to pump it through the body. 

In resume then, when ureamic symptoms appear , the 
diet is changed accordingly. If these syitiptoms are 
mild, an increase in headache, greater lassitude, with- 
out any more marked manifestations, perhaps a com- 
plete removal of nitrogenous foods,, with the customary 
purgation and sweating, will accomplish the purposes. 
It is really not difficult for a patient to get a fairly 
liberal diet on this basis. The lists given on page 124, 
without meat, may be consulted. Water, as stated, 
should be used freely. 

If, on the other hand, more marked symptoms are 
noted, it is best to employ a strict milk and water diet, 
at least temporarily, and then gradually to add cereals, 
cream, sugar, bread, vegetables, as has been described 
under acute nephritis. In these cases the diet is merely 
an accessor}^ in the general scheme to procure func* 
tional renal rest.

DISEASES 01? THE KIDNEY. 



VEGETABLES. 

The vegetables which the nephritic should use are 
green vegetables, as lettuce and spinach, and the roots 
and tubers, as potatoes and beets. Legumes, peas and 
beans should be avoided. Green vegetables and tubers 
have a large percentage of water. The chief food prin- 
cipal found in these is starch. They are low in 
protein and fat. Mineral salts are found in these in 
varying amounts and this makes these vegetables very 
valuable foods. A good rule for cooking vegetables is, 
use enough water to cover strong vegetables, and small 
amount for sweet vegetables. Onions and cabbage 
would thus require a larger quantity of water for cook- 
ing than spinach or squash or beets. 

Mashed Potatoes, 

Pare potatoes and put in cold water to keep 
from discoloring. Put into pan or kettle and cover 
with boiling water. When nearly cooked, add 
pinch of salt or tp. to every 3 potatoes. When 
tender, drain and mash. Add i teaspoon butter 
and I tsp. of hot milk or cream to every cup (8 
oz.) of mashed potato. Beat until light and 
creamy. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Scrub thoroughly one Irish or sweet potato. Cut

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 

"Blood pressure'* is now one of the bywords of the 
profession. Just as when appendicitis sprang into the 



144 



FOOD ^OR The sick. 



limelight of easy diagnosis, almost everyone seemed 
to suffer from appendicitis; so to-day, thanks primar- 
ily to the zeal of life insurance examiners, *1iig;h blood 
pressure'' is one of the commonest complaints of office 
practice. This concentration of attention on one symp- 
tom has been a tremendous factor for good — not un- 
mixed, however, with evil. Many patients have the 
impression that if they have high blocd pressure they 
have a disease which will probably cause their death in 
short order, and it is certainty the minority who ever 
realize that hypertension is rarely more than a symp- 
tom indicating some underlying pathological disturb- 
ance. '^Hardening of the arteries'*^ — once a stylish 
name, occupies an insignificant niche now, not only in 
lay minds, but, too frequently, in the minds of physic- 
ians when high blood pressure is found. A low-grade 
chronic nephritis is most often overlooked, merely be- 
cause the single urine specimen examined does not 
show albumen and casts. Hypertension, as the result 
of a chronic infection in tonsils, in teeth, in prostate, 
has received much attention; but too often an unjus- 
tified tonsil enucleation or a wholesale extraction of 
teeth is executed without any attempt at proving the 
relation of cause and eflfect. We do not wish to be- 
little in any way the practice of removing a possible 
source of infection and toxic absorption, but we feel 
that the interesting study of hypertension as a sym- 
tom receives a serious shock from a practice too often 
executed without study of the individual patient. And 
it is the purpose of this introduction merely to em- 



DISEASES 01^ THE KIDNEY. 



phasize that high blood pressure does not mean the 
same thing in every patient, and that properly to treat 
it requires careful analysis and a proper classification 
. before treatment is begun. 

The dietary regime one should advise a patient to 
follow would naturally depend almost entirely on the 
fundamental cause of the trouble. Since by far the 
greatest number of patients with high pressure have 
at least an accompanying if not a causative chronic 
nephritis of the interstitial type, the diet used in chronic 
nephritis will be found most valuable. Just as this 
diet is modified to suit the variations of the disease 
with the individual nephritic patient, so it is modified 
to perhaps an even greater extent with the patient with 
high blood pressure, and few if any other symptoms. 
Diet has seemed to us of perhaps less value than the 
avoidance of strain, emotional as well as physical. 
Not infrequently the worry associated with the knowl- 
edge of the possession of high blood pressure acts as a 
remarkable stimulant to mamtenance or increase of the 
pressure, and unless means to control such emotion are 
undertaken we believe dietary restrictions will be use- 
less, if not actually harmful, because of the tendency 
to center attention and increase the worry. It seems 
to us that it would be a better plan in many instances 
to allow a normal not excessive diet, rather than to 
adopt a strict regime when the latter would tend to 
upset the patient's equilibrium. (For details of diet 
see page 124.)

If the blood pressure is associated with arterial or 
cardiac disease, then of course treatment must aim at 
helping- the heart. This will be discussed in the fol- 
lowing chapter. 

KIDNEY STONE 

Broadly speaking tiie chemical composition of the 
kidney stone will determine the nature of the diet to 
be employed. There are tliree general types of stone: 
those made up of (i) uric acid, (2) calcium oxalate, 
(3) phosphates. 

Much has been written about the relation of diet to 
these various stones, but in not all cases do the chem- 
ical indications point to successful dietary treatment. 
However, with some patients it may be possible to 
prevent the formation of new calculi by proper control 
of diet and living, and certainly the attempt should be 
made in ail cases. 

Those patients whose calculi consist mainly of uric 
acid should be treated as w^e treat patients with gout. 
A well regulated life, a well balanced low caloric diet, 
plenty of water, and the prohibition of articles of food 
rich in uric acid precursors is advised (see page 100). 
One point in treatment differing from the treatment 
in gout may be mentioned. The uric acid calculus 
may be precipitated by physical-chemical changes in 
the urine rather than by a fundamental metabolic dis- 
turbance, the chemical change being shown by increas- 
ed urinary acidity. The use of alkalies or of alkali 
drinking w^ater is therefore advised in cases of uric 
acid stone. 



1 



DISEASES THE KIDNEY. 



So little is known of the cause of oxalate stones that 
it would not be of great avail to lay down explicit 
dietary rules. The removal from the diet of articles 
of food known to be rich in oxalates is advised from 
empiric reasons. Such foods are pepper, sorrel, rhu- 
barb, spinach, haricots, beet roots, dried figs, tea and 
cocoa. Food especially rich in calcium as milk, eggs 
and fresh vegetables (peas, beans, asparagfus, radishes) 
should also be avoided. Meats, cereals, bread, rice, 
potatoes, apples, in moderation, may all be used to ad- 
vantage by the person who must avoid oxalates and 
calcium. Also since in many cases the oxalate stone 
is associated with uric acid, the advice just given for 
uric acid stones may well be followed. 

Phosphatic stones usually are found only when the 
urine presents two distinct abnormalities (i) alkalin- 
ity, (2) evidence of infection of the . genito-urinary 
tract. The condition known as "phosphaturia", iti 
which a person passes an alkaline urine heavily loaded 
with a precipitation of phosphates, is often associated 
with a disturbance of the nervous system, and is prob- 
ably not due to diet. For this reason the treatment of 
patients who have had phosphatic stones is directed 
toward improving the nervous condition producing 
the phosphaturia, keeping the kidneys well washed out, 
and the urine acid or amphoteric — its normal condi- 
tion. Whether diet can influence this is doubtful; it 
has been suggested (Neuberg) that the limitation of 
foods high in lime such as milk, eggs, fruit and sub- 
stitution of lime-poor foods such as meat, potato, 



148 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 



cereals, has shown a good effect in some cases. The 
most important element in the diet and the only 
proved helpful agent is water, which should be taken 
freely. As far as "trying-out" different theoretical 
diet cures is concerned it seems to us that a good game 
of golf or tennis or a few days' outing is more potent 
in eliminating "phosphaturia" than is food. If the 
phosphaturia disappears, the treatment of an accom- 
panying infection will do the rest... 



CHAPTER VI. 

DISEASES OF THE HEART 

There can be no special diet for all patients suffer- 
ing with heart disease, any more than there can be 
a general method of treatment of such patients. A 
person with a disease of the heart without symptoms is 
quite different from the same patient after the disease 
has progressed to the stage where the heart muscle no 
longer performs it's normal function — the stage of de- 
compensation. A person with a completely compen- 
sated heart can lead a normal life with the possible ex- 
ception of the restriction or prohibition of alcohol and 
tobacco. There must be no excesses in food as in 
other matters, but on the whole, as has already been 
stated in the discussion of hypertension, the less at- 
tention such a patient pays to his diet the better he 
will be. 

When, however, decompensation sets in there are 
some principles of diet to be observed : ( i ) spare the 
work of the heart; (2) avoid pressure on the heart 
by the stomach and intestines. Fluids usually should 
be restricted, as the elimination of large amounts of 
fluids puts an extra burden on the heart. Fifteen hun- 
dred (1500) cc. best taken between meals forms the 
maximum limit for most cases. The severely ill pa- 
tients with edema generally will react to the same 
treatment already described for the "wet" cases of 
nephritis; in such cases the Karell cure (page 109) 
often causes a rapid disappearance of the edema. A 

(149) 



salt-poor diet has the same indications in heart disease 
as it has in kidney disease — edema ; and it can be used 
when we do not wish as low a diet as the Karell cnre. 
Alcohol is advised in very small qnantities, if at alL 

The actual food for moderately decompensated pa- 
tients should be easily digestible, and of a kind not 
likely to produce gas in the stomach. Small meals at 
frequent intervals will relieve the burden of the heart 
and kidneys, and will not be so likely to produce pres- 
sure on the heart by distending the stomach. The com- 
pletely decompensated patient, bed-ridden and dys- 
pnoeic requires a very light diet He will be incapable 
of the muscle work necessar>' to chew foods so that 
his diet must contain substances requiring only the 
effort of swallowing. Both because the stomach should 
not be filled and because of the danger of overexertion 
the food should be given at frequent intervals and in 
small amounts,

DISEASES OF THE HEART. 



As convalescence is established the diet can grad- 
ually be increased until a full tray is reached. All 
meats and vegetables should be chopped or scraped at 
first, and the heavier foods should be given only when 
the heart is practically compensated. For the reasons 
already given, no heart patient who has ever shown the 
signs of decompensation should eat large meals — the 
5 meal day should be his custom through life. Foods 
likely to ferment and produce gas in the stomach or 
intestines should be avoided. Mineral waters should 
be "stiir' rather than charged. It is always well for 
patients with heart disease — and this is especially true 
of those suffering from angina pectoris — to rest for 
one-half to one hour after meals. Often the strain of 
exercise, added to that of digestion and pressure from 
the full stomach, is just sufficient to bring on an at- 
tack of decompensation or of angina. Many patients 
with angina die suddenly just after eating — the symp- 
toms often being gastric, although the cause of death 
is the heart. 

We have already spoken of the diet in the arterio- 
sclerotic or the old myocarditic patient. (See page 
143.) On the whole it is difficult to persuade Ihese pa- 
tients to submit to any dietary changes, and as a mat- 
ter of fact many get along surprisingly well without 
interference with their ordinary habits. We can re- 
peat what we have already said in regard to dieting 
patients — especially older persons — with high blood 
pressure: if dietary restriction causes the patient to 
fret or worry about his condition more harm than good

can arise from insistence. Obviously unwise habits 
should be corrected, but on the whole a suitable diet

CHAPTER VII. 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

Perhaps the commonest disease of the stomach is 
acute indigestion. The disease which the newspapers 
often describe as acute indigestion, and which produces 
death, is usually angina pectoris or some other heart 
disease. Acute indigestion is the ordinary upset stom- 
ach occurring from food or drink which disagrees in 
some way ; for example, the green apple stomach ache ; 
the bad after effect of too cold or too hot drinks ; the 
result of improperly cooked foods — these are real 
acute indigestion. The symptoms generally noticed 
are referable to both stomach and intestines. The 
dietary rules are logical and simple: give the gastro- 
intestinal'canal a rest by taking away all foods except 
perhaps water and weak tea for 24 hours. Then the 
diet is gradually increased, at first using easily digested 
foods which have little "residue" until a normal diet 
is reached. The following diet will give a scheme for 
treating cases of acute stomach disturbances, which, of 
course, must be individualized. Barley water, strain- 
ed gruels, albumen water, broths and soups, soft eggs 
and soft toast may follow the weak tea and water diet. 
Milk diluted with water or seltzer may be given next, 
if milk is well borne. Gelatins, custards and other soft 
milk puddings are useful here. Mashed potatoes and 
strained vegetables are added next, and finally easily 
digested meats as fish or chicken. If no further symp- 

(155)

toms are experienced, the patient may then resume his 
former diet, 

ULCER OF THE STOMACH 

By ulcer of the stomach we mean an erosion of the 
lining which may be more or less deep, and more or 
less chronic. In its pathological picture it is so anala- 
goiis to an ulcer anywhere on the surface of the body 
that in principle the same treatment is applied — as fer 
as possible remove the cause of the ulcer and pre- 
vent further irritation, so as to allow it to heal. In 
the stomach this is not as easily accomplished as on the 
surface of the body, as it is not always easy to remove 
the hyperacid stomach juice which almost always ac- 
companies an ulcer and which probably has a causative 
relation to it. We can, however, attempt to neutral- 
ize this acid by the use of alkalies and proper food. 
Proper food must not only help neutralize the acid, but 
must be non-irritating to the ulcer and of such a nature 
that the work of digestion by the stomach will be re- 
duced to a minimum. In fundamental principles, at 
least, this method does not differ from the methods of 
treating a superficial ulcer. 

There are many surgical aspects to the treatment 
of gastric nicer, depending on the nature of the change 
in the stomach. A perforated ulcer or one which in 
its development has caused contraction and obstruc- 
tion of the stomach can hardly be benefited by a dietetic 
cure, and before subjecting such a patient to a rigid 



DISE:ASES 01^ TH^ STOMACH. 



medical treatment judgment must be used in deciding 
whether the patient requires operation. 

Each one of the many diet cures for ulcer of the 
stomach has for its object the attainment of gastric 
rest and the neutralization of the hyperacid gastric 
juice. Every form of dietetic treatment of ulcer has 
two phases — the acute treatment usually carried out 
with the patient on his back, and a continuation of this 
treatment by the patient as he gradually goes about 
his affairs. The latter part of the treatment is un- 
doubtedly the most difficult, because of the many temp- 
tations which meet a man's appetite when he is not 
under direct medical supervision. It is not difficult 
for a patient to follow orders while he is on his back 
and his tray is brought to him, but let the same patient 
begin to feel better, and he will find the path of least 
resistance to be to eat what tastes good. Therefore, 
the necessity for much detailed instruction to this pa- 
tient arises, and this instruction should deal not only 
with his "must not eat" but with his "may eat" as 
well. Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the fact 
that seldom if ever does the ordinary "ulcer cure" 
actually cure, but that a long standing supervision of 
diet is necessary. 

There are many diet cures in use, but the principles 
of all are the same: (i) bland food; (2) small quan- 
tities; (3) frequent feedings; (4) gradual increases. 
To accomplish our object we must adapt our method 
to the demands of the individual case. In many cases 
where the ulcer is superficial and producing slight

symptoms, Lenhartz' method may well be used. Tlie 
chart given explains itself, and it is only necessary to 
add that in the beginning the milk, eggs and sugar are 
mixed together, kept ice cold, and fed to the patient 
in teaspoon ful doses at frequent intervals. As more 
food is added the amount at each feeding is increased 
and the interval between feedings lengthened.

Continue for three weeks. 



In the course of any diet aire for ulcer other factors 
must be borne in mind as of equal importance. The 
patient is kept on his back in a state of physical and 
mental rest, an ice bag is kept on the abdomen, and 
large doses of alkali and of bismuth subcarbotiate, used 
in cases of hypersecretion^ usually are necessary. 
Many cases need no medication other than this. We 
have usually prescribed sodium bicarbonate and light 
calcined magnesia, 10 grains of each every 4 hours, 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. 



159 



alternating with bismuth subcarbonate gr. xv or xxx 
every 4 hours. 

Many physicians recommend absolute rest for the 
stomach for a few days before starting any diet 
regime. Some cases will even require rectal feeding 
for a few days. Oftentimes milk is not well borne, 
and as this forms the basis of the usual ulcer diet, it 
must be peptonized or modified by the addition of lime 
water or barley water, or some other alkaline water. 

Cases of ulcer of the stomach cannot be treated by 
any hard and fast rule, but they must be individualized 
and fed accordingly. As there are several types of 
ulcers, different methods of diet as well as of medica- 
tion must be used in treating them. The following 
plan has been used successfully in the treatment of 
some ulcer cases at The Michael Reese Hospital. It is 
impossible to give any stated length of time for the 
use of the diet at the beginning. It may only be neces- 
sary to continue milk and cream for three or four 
days, and it may have to be used for a much longer 
time. That must be decided by the physician accord- 
ing to the condition of the patient. Many patients 
will be able to reach the sixth stage at the end of two 
or three weeks. This diet, a gastro-intestinal diet 
similar to that given on page 169, must be followed for 
some weeks. Additions to the diet from this time 
should only be made by the physicians in charge, as the 
patient is not cured when he leaves the hospital, and 
he must be told plainly the danger of a return of his 
trouble if he returns to a normal diet too rapidly.

Gastro-intestinal Diet similar to that given on page

More rigid cures are prescribed when the symptoms

not stEirve except for hemorrhage or where there has 
been evidence of considerable gastric irritation; in the 
latter instance only until the disappearance of nausea 
and vomiting; in the case of hemorrliage for 2 to 4 
days. The food is begun very slowly, usually on the 
first day oz. each of milk and cream every hour for 
12 feedings, and continued according to the reaction 
of the patient 



DISEASES OF TH^ STOMACH. 1 63 



When the patient is ready to get up and out he must 
be impressed with the fact that although his diet is 
being changed, he is to continue to take small doses 
of bland foods at frequent intervals; that all highly 
seasoned foods, fried foods, pastries or other rich foods 
are to be avoided ; that alcohol and coffee are poisons 
to him, and that he should never let himself get hun- 
gry- 

With some little application at first most patients 
soon learn to develop a diet suitable to their taste as 
well as the disease, and they get along very well. But 
at times the construction of proper menus is difficult, 
and to ease this burden we refer to some specimen 
menus which have given satisfaction. (See page 169). 

RUI.ES FOR GASTRIC UI.CER PATIENTS. 

(Post Hospital Care.) 

1. Avoid irregularity of meals. 

2. Do not eat late dinners or midnight suppers. 

3. Do not over-eat. 

4. Avoid highly-seasoned foods, pickles, pastries, 
fried foods, -raw foods, coarse vegetables or any vege- 
tables not thoroughly cooked and strained, coffee or 
tea, alcoholic beverages, acid foods, very hot or very 
cold foods or beverages. 

5. Remember that your diet and your method of 
living require supervision for many months. 



FOOD fOR THE SICK. 



NERVOUS DYSPEPSIA 

Ulcer of the stomach is an organic disease — un- 
doubtedly the most common organic stomach disease, 
but it is probably true that most patients who com- 
plain of symptoms referable to the stomach have no 
organic stomach disease, A person may have pain 
and other pronounced symptoms of stomach trouble, 
without the stomach itself being diseased. Such symp- 
toms are usually due to disturbances somewhere in the 
very complex nervous mechanism controlling the work 
of the stomach. The nervous control of all organs 
can be compared to the system of wires controlling a 
telephone exchange. A short circuit in the basement 
may upset the whole service, or it may merely inter- 
fere with the 'phone in one's office. So, a mental ^ or 
an emotional shock may upset the nervous control of 
the stomach ; fright may produce nausea, intense men- 
tal application not uncommonly upsets a man*s diges- 
tion, and the overtired athlete has been known to end 
a race with an attack of vomiting. Such examples 
of emotional and mental control are easy to grasp, be- 
cause they have been experienced by most of us. Such 
nervous conditions, or as they are called ^^gastric 
neuroses,*' while not serious, may be extremely dis- 
tressing and require considerable care in treatment. 
Many cases are based on a change or disease elsewhere 
in the body, and the stomach symptoms then have to be 
considered secondar>^ to the seat of the trouble. 

These nervous derangements of the stomach are 
classified into (a) motor, (b) secretory and (c) sen- 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. 



sory disturbances, although rarely does one encoun- 
ter a pure type, as most cases of nervous dyspepsia 
show symptoms referable to all three functions of the 
stomach. From the standpoint of dietetic therapeutics 
it is not necessary to give details about the various 
types of such conditions encountered in practice ; mere- 
ly to mention the many and varied possible symptoms 
will suffice for our purpose. Gurgling and movements 
in the stomach, eructations of gas (many patients call 
this "gas-tritis"), vomiting, spasmodic pain, dull 
aches, heart-bum, variations in appetites may occur 
singly or in a group large enough and distressing 
enough to make a person think his illness is most seri- 
ous. It cannot be emphasized too often that if these 
symptoms are traced to an underlying physical or 
nervous disturbance, treatment must be directed to the 
primary cause of the trouble. It will do no good •to 
prescribe a diet for a woman whose symptoms are due 
to exhaustion from work or worry or from a fibroid 
of the uterus, unless we also treat the cause. In many 
men too much work and too little exercise causes con- 
stipation and many stomach symptoms, and in such 
men a diet aimed merely at the stomach symptoms is 
very likely to increase the constipation and do more 
harm than good. 

But if no cause can be found for symptoms, and the 
careful use of the stomach tube, especially the new 
tube of Rehfuss, has shown the exact functional de- 
rangement in the stomach, treatment for the stomach 
will often produce good results. The functional dis- 



i66 



fOOD FOR TH^ SICK. 



turbance most generally encountered is an excessive 
secretion df gastric juice of high acidity, the same 
condition found in ulcer of the stomach. In such 
cases the diet already planned for the second stage of 
ulcer should be used. (See page 169.) Increased 
motility of the stomach produces some of the symp- 
toms enumerated, but this condition is generally asso- 
ciated with hypersecretion and requires practically the 
same treatment, 

ATONY OF THE STOMACH 

Atony of the stomach — weakness of the muscular 
walls — requires a different regime. Here the functional 
disturbance is caused by an inability of the stomach to 
perform its muscular work; the diet then should be 
one which while not putting a burden on the stomach 
will nevertheless gradually strengthen the walls, so 
that ultimately they will do their work. The most im- 
portant elements would be the restriction of the amount 
of food and fluid taken at any time, and the use of 
food which does not require excessive muscular work, 

Friedenwald and Rtihrah recommend the following

7 A. M, Orange juice 40 gms. ........ 80 cal,

Hutchinson prohibits the following foods in cases of

1. All green vegetables except spinach anrf cauli- 
flower. Turnips, carrots, peas, beans and lentils. 

2. Fruits except baked apples and stewed prune 
pulp. 

3. Sugars and jam. 

4. Soups.

5, Bread not toasted, 

6. Tea, 

Potatoes may be taken very sparingly and coffee 
with plenty of milk. However, as little fluid as pos- 
sible must be taken with meals. 

Salisbury advocates an exclusive meat diet for 
atonic dyspepsia of a very severe type: 

y A. M. Hot water, ' 
S,jo A. M. Minced beef 2 oz. and upward. 
Water i pt. or less, 
M. Hot water. 
1.30 P. M, Minced beef 2 oz, and upwards. 
Water i pt. or less, 
5 P. M, Hot water or clear tea. 
tf,jo P. M. Minced beef 2 oz. and upwards. 
Water i pt. or less- 
10 P. M. Hot water. 

The water should be sipped slowly at about 120 F., 
and not over 13^ qts. should be taken daily, Salis- 
bury advocates this treatment only in exceptionally 
severe cases having a liberal gastric secretion, and even 
then for a period not exceeding six weeks. 



ACHYLIA CASTRICA 

One condition sometimes occurring as a gastric neu- 
rosis is known as "achylia gastrica"- — a disease of the 
stomach in which too little gastric juice is secreted. 
This condition may occur in cancer of the stomach, 
chronic gastritis, as a gastric neurosis and occasionally 



DISEASES THE STOMACH. 1 69 



as a secondary manifestation of disease elsewhere in 
the body. Since there is in this condition an absence 
of gastric juice, the diet should be easily digestible, and 
should be well prepared, so that the work of the stom- 
ach is lessened. We append a week's diet for such 
cases, the diet known in the Michael Reese Hospital 
as the "Gastro-intestinal Diet." The use of dilute 
hydrochloric acid and pepsin as an accessory to the diet 
is especially valuable in these cases.

CHRONIC GASTRITIS 

Chronic inflammation of the wall of the stomach is 
in practice a comparatively rare disease, and is seen 
usually only in persons who have exposed their stom- 
achs to the continued insults of alcohol, or poorly cook- 
ed foods, of foods too hot or drinks too cold. It fre- 
quently also occurs as a secondary manifestation of 
some constitutional disease, such as anemia, diabetes 
or especially tuberculosis ; and it may accompany local 
disorders of the stomach, especially cancer. The con- 



T72 



^OOD FOR THB SICK- 



dition of the stomach secretions may vary with the 
stage of the disease; at first an acid secretion may be 
found, but^ if the disease is of any standing, anacid- 
ity is almost sure to be present. Mucus is al\va}'s 
found in true gastritis. 

Dietetic treatment in this condition is of the utmost 
importance J but there cannot be a standard diet for 
all such patients. First of all the actual cause of the 
condition must be ascertained and corrected. If the 
patient drinks too much alcohol, no diet will help him 
until the alcohol is removed from his day's routine. If 
excessive indulgence in hot breads is responsible, hot 
breads must be removed. 

After the cause of the disturbance is corrected, a 
well-balanced diet can easily be constructed, but in the 
menu due attention must be paid to idiosyncrasies of 
the patient. It is a well known fact that a food which 
one man can digest will produce serious stomach symp- 
toms in the next, and it is useless to attempt to force 
all patients to take the same cure. Certain funda- 
mental facts are apparent in any diet for chronic gas- 
tritis. ( I ) Food must not be irritating to the already 
irritated stomach wall, and (2) it should be "bland," 
The gastro-intestinal diet already given (page 169) 
offers a good basis for treatment. 

CANCER OF THE STOMACH 

The dietetic aim for a patient with cancer of the 
stomach would be to give him as much comfort as 
possible, and to allow him to eat what agrees with 



DISEASES THE STOMACH. 



him. A distaste for meats is common with such. pa- 
tients, and usually fluids and soft foods are best borne. 
It is often difficult to stimulate the appetite for any 
foods, and it seems to us of far more importance to 
prepare the food in an enticing way than to direct the 
use of any special foods. If the caprices of appetite 
carry a patient beyond the bounds of the theoretically 
indicated foods he should bq allowed to follow his 
whims. Those in charge of patients with cancer must 
learn to cater to their appetites, but they must also 
learn to see that the food contains nourishing sub- 
stances. Almost any taste can be gratified by care in 
selecting and preparing the articles of diet. (See page 
186.) 



CHAPTER VIII. 



. DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES 
ACUTE DIARRHEA 

Diarrhea as an acute manifestation is perhaps most 
frequently caused by the same agents as produce acute 
indigestion — or acute gastritis : something wrong with 
the food or drink. 

The diet for an acute diarrhea must be an easily di- 
gested non-irritating one. In very severe cases ab- 
stinence from all food is often advisable. Barley 
water, weak tea, or plain water may be given to quench 
thirst. Weak cereal waters and gruels given at body 
temperature afford the first nourishment given follow- 
ing the fasting; thin broths, bouillons and albumen 
waters, boiled milk diluted with lime water, beef juice, 
cold tea flavored with a little lemon juice are often well 
used after the cereals. It is, of course, impossible to 
prescribe any set diet for diarrheas. The cause of the 
diarrhea must be found first and the diet will be gov- 
erned by this, of necessity. In general, however, it is 
safe to say, that in cases of either acute or chronic diar- 
rheas all bulky foods, fruits, sour foods, hot liquids and 
alcoholic beverages should be avoided. This proscribed 
list would contain green vegetables, coarse breads, 
fruits, coffee. 

If the disease has been acute and the cause has been 
found and removed, it is often well to proceed as in 
the case of chronic diarrheas in order to avoid irritat- 

(175)

ing the intestines. If inilk can be taken at all, and one 
must proceed with caution in determining this, the food 
value of the diet will more easily approach the normal. 
A few diets beneficial in some cases are given here :

CHRONIC DIARRHEA 

Diarrhea, constipation and pain in the abdomen are 
the three most usual symptoms of intestinal disease, 



DISEASES THE INTESTINES. 1 77 



but what has already been said as to the necessity of 
diagnosing the cause of symptoms in stomach disease 
refers with equal force to the intestines. Diarrhea 
may arise as a result of constipation, and constipation 
itself may result from all sorts of causes. If a patient 
has diarrhea as a result of the irritant action of fecal 
masses, dietary regulations directed to the diarrhea will 
only increase the symptoms; constipation may come 
from bad habits of living or of going to stool, it may 
be the result of obstruction of the bowels from various 
causes, or it may be a secondary manifestation of some 
stomach disturbance. Of course, exactly the same con- 
dition exists as regards pain in the abdomen. There- 
fore, no symptom or gjroup of symptoms of disease of 
the intestinal tract should receive medical or dietetic 
treatment until the underlying cause is ascertained. 
However, when the real disturbance is once proved 
diet will be found often the most valuable theraupeutic 
asset. 

We must assume then that a diagnosis has been es- 
tablished, and that the diarrhea to be treated belongs 
to one of the groups commonly encountered, which 
may be conveniently discussed under the following 
classification: (i) Diarrhea due to Chronic Colitis; 
(2) Mucous Colitis; (3) Achylia Gastrica; (4) Diar- 
rhoea Nervosa;. (5) Amebic Dysentery; (6) Small 
Intestine Inflammation; (7) "Food Diarrheas." 

There is considerable discussion as to the use of 
various articles of food in these diarrheas, but it seems 
to us that as Friedman [Med. CI., Chic. Vol. 2, Sept., 
12 



^7^ FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

'9'^ p. 354/1 says, the manner of preparing the food 
IS of greater iini>ortance than the nature of the fo^ 
K.von. All irritating parts of food and substances not 
easily absorbable are certainly contra-indicated. There- 
forr, if meat is given it should be scraped; if vegetables 
arc added they must be pureed. 

fii the nervous diarrheas produced so easily by the 
slightest emotion in a susceptible individual dietary re- 
sl I id ions seem decidedly out of place. Such patients 
an- apt lo be under-nourished anyhov\^, and attention to 
their diet will concentrate interest on their ailments 
and canse a pronounced vicious circle, vsrhich will re- 
Mill in <'ven greater undcr-nourishment. The way to 
treat lliesc patients is by upbuilding the nervous sys- 
tem and re-education. In the cases of so-called mu- 
eons eoliiis some men achieve better results by a heavy 
dirl aimerl at the constipation, others advise bland food. 
We believe that in these cases the diet to be used will 
deiHMid on the nature of the constipation; if it is of the 
spastic ty|>e a bland diet is indicated, if atonic then the 
heavy constipation diet will give better results. .

CONSTIPATION 

Constipation as a symptom of other diseases of the 
intestines need not be discussed in these pages. As a 
clinical entity — ^a disease in itself, it occurs frequent- 
ly enough to warrant our devoting considerable space 
to it. Strangely enough some persons have symptoms 
when the bowels do not move at an appointed hour 
each day, whereas others go through life constipated 
and symptomless. In some persons constipation is like 
Topsy ; despite a normal life in every particular it "just 
grows," and very frequently this tendency runs in 
families. In most persons, however, constipation can 
be traced to the method of living or the method of 
eating. Too frequently busy men or careless women 
seem to forget that attention to their bowels is as im- 
portant to health as attention to their business or 



I So FOOD FOR THE SICK, 

household is to success. The man who rushes from 
his breakfast to his business and from his business to 
his pleasures, and thus finds no time to attend to the 
call of Nature, soon finds that the call no longer is 
made; and unless he checks himself in time, he ulti- 
mately finds himself a habitual user of little pills or 
a chronic drinker of laxative waters. His bowels 
^vhich he refused to care for no longer care for him, 
and habitual constipation is his portion. Then there 
are persons whose interest in food is to tickle the palate, 
and who pay no attention to the needs of the stomach 
or intestine ; one may eat food containing more residue 
or undigestible material than his intestines have the 
power to get rid of, the other may not eat enough of 
the coarser foods to provide a stimulus to the intes* 
tine. In making out a normal diet due attention is not 
always paid to the elements of food which aflfect in- 
testinal movements. There is another class of persons 
— the so-called nervous dyspeptic — ^who without an 
organic stomach trouble nevertheless have numerous 
stomach complaints traceable to an excessive secretion 
of gastric juice due usually to some nervous complaints. 
Whatever be the original stimulus to these stomach 
symptoms, constipation generally accompanies or fol- 
lows, and a vicious circle is established; constipation 
intensifying the nervous symptoms and the dyspepsia 
intensifying the constipation through the fear of proper 
food. 

The pathological condition of the intestines in con- 
stipation usually may be discovered by physical and 



DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES. l8l 



X-Ray examination, and should be determined before 
treatment is instituted. Most cases of constipation may 
be classified under one of three types (a) the atonic 
colon, (6) the spastic colon, (c) the dilated rectum. 
Probably the most common type encountered is the 
atonic colon. 

Practically all patients except those with the spastic 
colon or with the dilated rectum can be subjected to the 
same general scheme of treatment, and can be promised 
relief if they persevere in following the rules. Although 
the diet plays a most important role, other elements 
dealing with one's daily routine enter into the treat- 
ment, especially regularity in eating, in exercise and in 
attention to the bowels. In those patients whose con- 
stipation seems the result of too little attention to the 
bowels especial insistence on regularity must be en- 
joined. Those who have neglected exercise and have 
spent their whole time seated at a desk need exercise; 
either muscular movements, which are so pronounced 
an aid, or outdoor exercise. The nervous dyspeptic 
whose stomach symptoms are definitely proved to be 
functional will often be surprised at the ease with 
which he can digest a dinner of corned beef and cab- 
bage, or other coarse food. But in all patients a rou- 
tine must be enjoined and must be adhered to. We

of this duty must be considered almost a rite. (4) 
At least one hour's exercise a day, (5) water in plenty

This diet will be found beneficial for most cases of 
constipation, but it is doubtful if it will benefit the pa- 
tients with a spastic colon or with the weak dilated 
rectum. Such patients require a less bulky diet which, 
however, should contain starches, fruit juices and 
strained vegetables. The gBstro-intestinal diet (page 
169) forms a good basis for treatment.

MEATS. 

Scraped beef: Take a slice of round steak about 
^ inch to I inch thick and scrape meat from the fibres 
with a metal spoon. Scrape with the grain of the 
meat. Make this into cakes and pan broil lightly and 
serve hot. Season with speck of salt. 

Minced or ground beef or lamb: Take slices of 
well-cooked lamb or beef and free them from fat and 
gristle as nearly as possible. If a grinder is used one 
must have very fine knives and the meat must be finely 
divided. If chopped, chop as finely as possible. The 
meat may be served with gravy from which the fat has 
been removed. 

Minced chicken: Chop or grind chicken very finely. 
Serve with white sauce or with chicken gravy from 
which the fat has been removed.

CHAPTER IX 



DISEASES OF THE LIVER 

Whether the so-called attacks of "biliousness" so 
frequently complained of by patients are to be con- 
sidered hepatic in origin, or whether they result en- 
tirely from intestinal stasis, is a disputed question. 
From a practical standpoint the treatment would be the 
same in either condition, for any treatment which would 
cause intestinal movements would be apt to cause an in- 
creased flow of bile from the liver. The old fashioned 
method of giving a dose of calomel and salts and a 
temporary starvation diet generally produced results, 
and certainly can not be improved upon unless one ob- 
jects to the use of calomel as a purge. But in patients 
subject to such attacks prevention is better than cure, 
and the physician should attempt to discover the cause 
of the attacks. - A person usually active, who is cem- 
pelled to lead a sedentary life, and who as a result be- 
comes constipated, is very likely to become "bilious" 
and just as likely to be free of his biliousness as soon 
as he has regular bowel movements. But there • are 
persons subject to the vague symptom complex under 
discussion whose complaints definitely arise from 
dietary indiscretions. Such errors may take any form ; 
one eats sweets in excess, the next eats too much fat. 
Usually only a cursory analysis of the patient's habits 
is necessary to detect the source of his complaints, and 
if detection is followed by abstinence, a cure will fol- 

(191)

low. Alcohol is undoubtedly a common cause, and we 
are of the opinion that excessive smoking may like- 
wise be indicted as a harmful agent in the production of 
**bilioosness/' 

During an acute attack while the "cleaning out" pro- 
cess is taking place, as little food as possible should be 
taken and that should be easily digestible, not gas- 
forming, and with little fat, for example : 

Breakfast: Tea, toast, oatmeal with a little milk and 
sugar. 

Dinner: Soup, poached eggs on toast^ baked apple^ 
glass of milk. 

Supper: Same as dinner. 

Following the attack, food chosen from the following 
diet list may be taken, gradually increasing the variety 
and amount of the food until the diet approaches the 
normal as nearly as possible. In some cases no milk 
can be taken. Very little sugar should be used. 

Lean beef or lamb, white lean fish, chicken, squab, 
sweetbreads, eggs, custard, junket, buttermilk, skim- 
med milk, green vegetables and salads (without oil), 
small amount of potatoes once daily, rice, tapioca, sago, 
fresh and stewed fruit (very little sugar), weak tea 
and coffee, 

I. 

Breakfast: Stewed prunes, oatmeal with milk, weak 
coffee with milk, dry toast. 

Dinner: Vegetable soup, crackers, roast lamb (very 
lean), small serving boiled potatoes, junket, weak tea

CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER 

The treatment of cirrhosis of the liver will depend 
first on the cause and second on the stage of the disease 
at which treatment is instituted. The commonest types 
of cirrhosis are those produced by alcohol and by 
syphilis; in both instances diet plays an important role 
13 



194 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 



in cure, but the diet will be determined by the oHidition 
of the patient. It is a fact that many cases of cirrhosis 
of the liver are not diagnosed until long after the onset 
of the disease, when the sjmptoms are those of cir- 
culatory obstruction or of poisoning. If, however, a 
diagnosis is made early, excellent results can often be 
obtained by proper restrictions of food and drink. When 
alcohol has been the causative agent, abstinence must 
be practiced, and the temperate use of all foods urged. 
The food ingested should be of the non-irritating bland 
t)T>e, the amounts taken at any one time should not be 
large, the bo%vels must move regularly, and the patient 
should lead a well-regulated life. Even when alco- 
hoi is not the cause of the cirrhosis it must be strictly 
enjoined in all suffering from liver disease except when 
especially indicated as a stimulant. 

Unfortunately most patients with cirrhosis of the 
liver come for treatment w^hen there are many symp- 
toms due to obstruction. These symptoms may vary 
from dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting — even hematemesis, 
to ascites. In such cases the condition of all the organs 
must be studied before treatment is instituted, and the 
diet to be prescribed will depend almost entirely on the 
condition of the other organs. If the symptoms are 
mainly gastric and there is no ascites, no heart or kid- 
ney involvement, a gastro-intestinal diet will be use- 
ful. Reference to the diets given in Chapter VII for 
chronic gastritis will he helpful in these cases. When 
ascites is present, with or without kidney disturbances, 
at least a temporary employment of a "dry" diet, or 



DISEASES OF THE UVER. 



195 



even of the Karell milk cure is advisable. (See 
page 109). 

DRY DIET. 

The dry diet restricts fluids to two pints daily. It 
consists of the ordinary diet with no soups and very 
little tea or coffee. 

When the kidney is involved, the diet to be used 
must depend on the function of the kidney. This has 
been discussed in full (see page 105). In the very 
late stages of the disease when the patient is evidently 
suffering from poisoning the treatment is eliminative, 
and the diet will be mainly composed of milk and milk 
products. 

Finally, in summarizing, we would say in all cases 
of liver complaints, the restrictions are chiefly limited 
in three things, fats, carbohydrates and alcoholic bev- 
erages. The "bile which is secreted by the liver is the 
chief emulsifier of the fats which are consumed. When 
the liver is diseased the flow of the bile is lessened and 
fats cannot be utilized by the body. Hence they are 
of no use to the body, so we necessarily restrict or pro- 
hibit their use according to the severity of the disease. 

One function of the liver is to convert the sugar, 
which has entered the blood, into glycogen. If the 
liver is diseased its glycogen forming power is impair- 
ed so that the intake of starches and sugars must be 
lessened accordingly. 

Alcoholic beverages, unless prescribed by the attend- 
ing physician, should never be taken. Then they are 
usually given well diluted. It is a well known fact 



FOOD FOR THE SICK, 



that excessive or constant use of alcohol produces cer« 
tain changes in the liver which hinders Its usefulness, 

CALL STONES 

In gall stones and in inflammatory diseases of 
the gall bladder diet plays a prominent role both in 
prevention and treatment. Clinical and experimental 
evidence may be accumulated to prove a metabolic in* 
fluence in gall stones — an influence which must be rec- 
ognized even in those cases in which surgical interfer- 
ence is indicated. Persons having had gall stone at- 
tacks should learn certain dietary rules, the most im- 
portantof which are (i) avoid fats; (2) prevent stasis 
of bile. The rules apply as well to the patient already 
treated surgically as to the one on whom we wish to 
prevent an operation, for it has been shown that in 
gall stone disease, as in many other abdominal condi- 
tions, surgery, under certain indicationSj acts to create 
a condition which cannot be maintained without con- 
tinous and careful control of the nutrition. 

We have just stated that the first rule is the avoid- 
ance of fats, as fats are harmful in two ways: (i) 
they apparently exert a direct chemical influence on the 
formation of stones; (2) they produce indigestion and 
intestinal stasis. Intestinal stasis, by producing a 
slowing up of the whole intestinal canat, is likely to 
dam back the flow of bile, which would assist the 
formation of stones, not only because of the mechanical 
effect but because of the influence of bacteria. 



DISEASES OF THE UVER. 



197 



In persons subject to gall stones an attempt should 
be made to have the flow of bile almost continuous, 
and perhaps the best way if not the only way to accom- 
plish this end is by a diet making practically a contin- 
uous call on the liver. In other words, the patient 
should eat at frequent intervals, should even eat before 
retiring, and should break the long night fast by a 
large breakfast. In persons whose gall bladder has 
been drained a cessation of the flow of bile into the 
drainage tube can be demonstrated at night, and can 
be relieved by the giving of food. 

A diet then based on the principles just outlined can 
be given as follows: 

DIET how IN FAT. 

Soups: Stock soups, meat broths, from which all 
fat has been removed. 

Vegetables: Fresh and cooked, except peas and 
carrots and sweet vegetables. 

Fruits: Oranges, lemons, grapefruit and unsweet- 
ened stewed fruit. 

Cereals: Wheat, barley and rice cereals; sago and 
tapioca.

daily; use salt in moderation.

CHAPTER X. 



DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 

Some diseases of the respiratory system are discussed 
under different headings, and in order to prevent rep- 
etition will not be mentioned in this chapter. In cer- 
tain other diseases the diet plays no important role be- 
yond that indicated for the general condition, of which 
the respiratory disturbance is a part. 

PLEURISY 

Pleurisy may be either dry or wet; in either case it 
is likely to be tuberculous in origin. In the dry fibrin- 
ous pleurisy certainly no especial dietary rules are in- 
dicated. If the disease is acute and febrile it should be 
treated as an acute fever (see Chapter XII, page 223), 
until the acute stage is past. When no longer acute, 
pleurisy means that the patient should be given the 
benefit of the doubt and should receive the same good 
nourishing food which is advocated in the treatment of 
pulmonary tuberculosis (Chapter X, page 204). 

On the other hand, considerable discussion has arisen 
as to the diet in pleurisy with effusion — a discussion 
based on the assumption that a ''dry" diet accompanied 
by free watery stools promotes absorption of fluid. 
Theoretically at least such a diet, or even one in which 
salt is restricted, may be indicated and may well be 
tried out in the individual case; but in every case of 
pleurisy with effusion a high caloric nourishing diet 

(201) 



must be employed. Otherwise \ve sliall find to our 
regret that we have undermined the stren^h of the pa- 
tient just at the time he needs it most. 

BRONCHIAL ASTHMA 

Bronchial asthma as distinct from the asthma of 
cardiac or renal disease, or that produced by thyroid or 
th\Tnus pressure, is a disease very like hay fever; and 
within recent years a most interesting line of work has 
been opened tending to show that as hay fever repre- 
sents a state of susceptibility to the proteins of certain 
plants, so asthma also represents a state of suscep- 
tibility to protein. In the case of asthma the proteins 
may be (a) inspired through the respiratory tract, (b) 
ingested through the gastro-intestinal tract, or (c) de- 
rived from the bacteria in a focus of infection anywhere 
in the body. The treatment of asthma then would de- 
mand that an attempt be made to discover the offend- 
ing protein. The method to be pursued is, however, 
not always simple ; especially if the offender belongs 
to the ingested proteins — ^the food stuffs. In Chapter 
XIj page 21 on diseases of the skin, we shall discuss 
the skin test by which protein sensitization can be dis- 
covered. If a particular food is found to be at fault 
the patient will frequently be freed of his asthmatic 
attacks merely by the elimination of that food from 
his diet But in cases of asthma, as in other instances 
of food susceptibility, we should not rest content with 
merely finding a food to which the patient reacts. The 
presence of a focus of infection anywhere in the body 



DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. 203 

will often be the4)rimary cause of protein suscepti- 
bility, and until the focus is cleaned out permanent re- 
sults will not result from dietary changes. 

But in not all cases of bronchial asthma can a defi- 
nite cause be localized, and in all cases diet must be 
used which will aid the patient. Many asthmatics know 
certain foods which either produce or intensify their 
attacks, and all asthmatics have learned certain rules of 
eating. An asthmatic patient should not eat large 
meals, should beware of any food which produces in- 
testinal gas and should have regular bowel movements. 
If the asthma has persisted, and is associated with a 
weakening of the heart muscle, special care must be 
. exercised in feeding (see myocarditis, page 151). Dur- 
ing an attack the food should be reduced to a minimum ; 
between attacks the rules just laid down will suggest 
the following menu. Only light, easily digested foods 
should be taken. The heavy meal should always be 
taken at noon and the evening meal should be light 
and not too late in the day. 

DIET i^OR ASTHMA. 

Breakfast: Stewed fruit, i or 2 eggs, cereal with 
cream, coffee, cream, toast and butter. 

Dinner: Cream or. meat soup, small serving of poul- 
try or fish, beef or lamb, potatoes, one easily digested 
vegetable, as spinach, carrots, peas, etc., soft pudding or

FOOD FOR THE SICK, 



TUBERCULOSIS 

The manifestations of tuljerculosis are varied in- 
deed. One patient may have an acutely febrile, rapidly 
progressive disease, the next may have a slow, chronic 
infection with only minor symptoms requiring atten- 
tion ; or the disease may present a picture between 
these extremes. In all cases we should use every means - 
in our power to increase the patient's resistance, and 
the means commonly employed have this object in view. 
We give the patient a combination of fresh air, sun- 
light, rest— pliysical and mental, and good food. With- 
out a healthy surrounding food will not be of nmch 
avail, nor will it benefit a patient to send him 'Svest to 
a warmer climate" unless we are sure that he will have 
good food when he gets there. The factors in a cure 
are potent for good only when grouped together, so 
that in the individual patient it is often necessary to 
emphasize one neglected factor in order to equalize all. 

Although food does play such an important role in 
the cure of tuberculosis, we do not believe that the 
giving of proper food is equivalent to overfeeding. In 
fact, our experience with tuberculous patients leads us 
to believe that at least in some cases overfeeding is 
decidedly contra-indicated. The tuberculous patient re- 
quires strength rather than fat, and often the attempt to 
"put on flesh" adds such a burden to the digestive sys- 
tem as seriously to interfere with the proper healing of 
his tuberculous focus. 

There are two elements in feeding (i) the state of 
nutrition, (2) the appetite and digestion. It is obvi- 



DISEASES OF THK RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. 20$ 

ous that the strength to resist an infection is not pos- 
sible with a man whose general system is undernourish- 
ed, and it is equally obvious that a person whose appe- 
tite and digestion are impaired can not successfully as- 
similate food unless we assist his digestion by the 
proper choice of food substances. 

We shall not discuss the feeding problem in institu- 
tions for the tuberculous, where the purely medical 
side is so closely bound with the problems of ad- 
ministration and of economics, but shall direct our ef- 
forts to the feeding of the tuberculous patient at his 
home or wherever his individual tastes and caprices can 
be learned and appealed to. 

Speaking then entirely of the individual patient, our 
problem is to put him in a good state of nutrition, and 
if necessary improve appetite and digestion. These 
rules apply to all patients ; with some undernourishment 
results from digestive disturbances, with others it may 
be due to a poorly selected diet. The acutely ill tuber- 
culous patient with fever, and perhaps hemorrhages, 
will not eat the same food we would give to a man 
with a less virulent infection ; but even the febrile pati- 
ent should as soon as possible receive a high caloric 
diet. If his fever is high and he is at absolute 
(bed) rest, a diet such as we have already described as 
the "High Caloric Typhoid Diet" (see page 39) as 
a rule will be well assimilated. This would apply to 
the very sick patient at any stage of the disease. 

The digestive disturbances and lack of appetite of 
the less severely ill will often disappear when his sur-

roundings are changed and he learns to '^take life easy" 
and to live out-doors. But it may be necessary to sup- 
plement our diet instructions with information obtained 
by the stomach tube and analyses of the stool. If hypo 
or hyperacidity is present it must be taken into con- 
sideration and the diet modified to meet the actual con- 
ditions in the stomach. (See pages i68 and 169). If 
there is evident distress after certain foods, or if the 
examination of the stools shows deficiency of digestion 
of any particular food it is wise to withhold such foods 
from the diet. When constipation arises, the food must 
be considered from this standpoint (see page 179). 
Ordinarily speaking a well balanced normal diet (see 
page 36) is the best food we can prescribe for a tuber- 
culous patient, provided attention is paid to the particu- 
lar demands of the individual. When there is evident 
under-nutrition the patient should, of course, be built up 
to a normal weight, or even beyond his normal; but 
nothing is gained in the long run by overwhelming the 
tuberculous patient with food. As a rule three square 
meals a day, in which the proportions of protein, fat 
and carbohydrate are properly balanced, will give a 
patient all the nutrition he needs or can well use. As a 
means of filling a day's schedule and of relieving the 
routine of the *'cure/* small between-meal feedings 
may be used, but are by no means necessary. 

We have for a long time had in actual practice the 
method of feeding just described. Our tuberculous 
patients, rich or poor, are told to eat w^ithout special 
regard to any particiUar food or class of foods, and 



DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. 20/ * 

most seem to get along very well indeed. Of course, 
the patient' whose gastro-intestinal canal requires at- 
tention receives special instruction; but as a rule such 
disturbances are miner and of short duration. It 
must be emphasized again that although under-nutri- 
tion must be combatted, mere addition of weight to a 
tuberculous patient does not necessarily mean an im- 
provement in his lung condition, and should never be 
the ultimate goal of the treatment.

CHAPTER XI. 



DISEASES OF THE SKIN 

There are certain diseases of the skin which are 
caused by errors in diet and certain others which sure- 
ly are influenced by food. Yet on the whole the diet- 
ary control of diseases of the skin cannot be said to 
be very satisfactory. At present, however, a consid- 
erable amount of research is going on which may have 
an important bearing in associating many skin dis- 
eases with disorders of nutrition. More diseases are 
constantly being considered from the viewpoint of in- 
dividual susceptibility — sensitization — to some partic- 
ular food-stuff, and in the study of such relations use 
is freely made of the skin reaction made familiar by 
von Pirquet. In the cases of foods, extracts of vari- 
ous suspected materials are made and the patient test- 
ed just as he would be tested for von Pirquet' s tuber- 
culin test ; the person sensitive to a particular food will 
react just as a tuberculous patient will react to the 
von Pirquet test. Although much valuable informa- 
tion has already been derived from this line of work, 
especially in regard to urticaria and eczema, we do not 
feel that as yet far-fetching conclusions are justifiable. 

Bulkley has pointed out various theoretical ways in 
which diet may influence skin disorders. 

I. There may be a direct irritating action from the 
ingesta upon the stomach and intestine producing a 
reflex skin eruption, as in erythemas and urticaria from 
shellfish, strawberries, mush, etc. 

(211) 



212 



^OOD FOR the: sick. 



2. Articles of diet may produce various forms of gas- 
tric and intestinal indigestion leading to the produc- 
tion of imperfectly elaborated material or to toxins 
which then have a direct irritating effect on the circu- 
lation through the capillaries, or on the skin during 
their elimination, as in acne from excessive indulg- 
ence in sweets, and some other affections from an ex- 
cessive protein diet. 

3. Possibly certain food elements may have an ac- 
tion directly on the skin in a manner similar to that of 
some drugs, as the iodides and bromides, 

4. Errors in diet may consist in the absence of cer-^ 
tain elements requisite for the proper and exact nutri- 
tion of the skin. 

A good general rule to follow In the dietary treat- 
ment of skin diseases is this, "the more acute the der* 
matitis the more restricted the diet." This measure is 
in accord with the known medical law udiich demands 
putting an inflamed part at rest, and it is obvious that 
an inflamed skin, like the rest of the body, may obtain 
functional rest by cutting dow'n the amount or chang- 
ing the character of the food. An itching skin will 
not tolerate articles of diet such as alcohol or highly 
spiced foods which intensify itching and other inflam- 
matory symptoms by increasing the blood supply to the 
already highly vascularized areas, 

ECZEMA (Adurt Type) 

No absolute rule can be laid down regarding the 
diet in eczema. Each individual should be given the 



DISEASES THE SKIN. 



213 



quantity and quality of food necessary to nourish the 
body without interfering with digestion and elimina- 
tion. Most patients with eczema eat an excess rather 
than an insufficient amount of food. It is well for 
eczematous individuals to avoid the beginning and the 
end of a meal. Soups do harm by diluting the gas- 
tric juice or by producing indigestion because of their 
fat content. The patient should avoid all fried foods, 
all highly seasoned food, "rich" food such as dough- 
nuts, pastries and hot breads, food of high caloric 
value such as cheese, nuts, raisins, very sweet pre- 
serves, candies, soda water with heavy syrup. Coffee 
or tea may not be harmful, but water should be taken 
freely. Probably the fame of the various mineral 
springs in skin diseases is due not to the particular 
kind of water consumed but to the quantity that indi- 
viduals frequenting these resorts feel it their duty to 
drink. In an eczema associated with glycosuria the 
usual diet for that condition should be instituted (see 
Chapter III). If in eczema the skin reaction already 
mentioned shows a definite susceptibility to one par- 
ticular kind of food, that food should be entirely 
eliminated from the diet. 

In some of the very acute and generalized eczemas 
met with good results can frequently be obtained by 
limiting the patients to a low caloric diet. Bulkley 
employs rice, bread and water and restricts the entire 
dietary to these foods until the acuteness subsides. 



214 



^OOD FOR TH^ SICK, 



Bui.ki.ey's **Rice Diet/' 
Rice boiled in water for J4 hour, then left uncovered 
to dry out for 15 or 20 minutes. 

Fine white bread at least 24 hours old. 
Butter is used freely, at least }^ pound daily. 
Water hot or cold (not iced) drunk separately from 
food. 

AH food is thoroughly masticated, giving 5^ hour 
to each meal. The rice is eaten with a fork. The diet 
is kept up 5 days for an acute eruption and is repeated 
or continued as necessary. 

INFANTILE ECZEMA 

The dietary treatment of infantile eczema has been a 
much disputed question, and at some time or other 
each of the four cardinal food constituents has been 
held to be at fault. The general opinion to-day is that 
eczematous chiFdren are over-fed, although oc- 
casionally even in properly fed individuals, adults as 
well as children, one sees an eczema produced or re- 
cur upon the ingestion of some particular article of 
food, as for example egg white, oatmeal or buck- 
wheat flour. This reaction is undoubtedly anaphylac- 
tic in nature. It is surprising to see the excellent re- 
sults accomplished by merely cutting down the quan- 
tity of food in eczematous infants. It is the general 
nile to diminish the quantity of all four food elements, 
although it has been recently advanced that one may 
have an infantile eczema due to excessive fat or one 
due to excessive sugar; the former being of the weep- 



DISEASES 01^ THE SKIN. 



ing type, the latter dry. The diet then is the most im- 
portant part of the treatment, and more stress should 
be laid on the diet than on the local care of the skin. 
The latter should be protective and non-irritating. 

In the case of eczema occurring in nursing children 
the calories can be diminished by reducing the num- 
ber and duration of feedings. In addition the ad- 
ministration of water sweetened with a little sugar, if 
necessary, before each feeding, will satisfy the child's 
hunger and yet by "spoiling his appetite" prevent the 
intake of too much milk. 

As the child, grows older broths and fruit juices 
which have a small food value can be given with the 
idea of satisfying the appetite without increasing the 
caloric value of the food. In still older patients coarse 
vegetables can be substituted for the rich cereals, but- 
ter, cream, jellies and cakes which these children 
usually eat in excess. As a rule, when a nursing child 
with eczema is put on a mixed diet, the eczema im- 
proves or even disappears. In many children the ques- 
tion resolves itself into the choice of food, as many of 
the patients are fed substances totally unfit for even 
the adult stomach. It is common experience to en- 
counter eczema in children who have been fed such 
indigestible foods as sweet cakes, candy, or pastries, 
cabbage, bananas, pickles; and in these cases the ec- 
zema is likely to disappear when the oflFending food- 
stuffs are removed. 

The nursing mother is often responsible for the 
eczema of her child. Excessive use of tea, chocolate, 



2l6 



FOOD FOR TH^ SICK. 



beer or wme may so interfere with the mother's di- 
gestion and assimilation of foods as definitely to affect 
her milk supply. When such indiscretions are dis- 
covered prompt attention must be directed to the 
source of supply. 

ACNE 

The dietary care of the patients with acne (vul- 
garis and rosacea) is of considerable importance, al- 
though it cannot be said that dietary errors alone pro- 
duce the disease. The majority of acne patients are 
constipated, are big eaters and with little or no ten- 
dency to exercise. It is therefore a\lvi sable to put 
these individuals on a coarse diet of a relatively low 
caloric value in addition to exercise and general hy- 
giene. It is wise, in order to reduce food errors to 
a minimum, to ask the patient to carry a small note 
book in which he jots down each article eaten and 
any article that he may desire to eat. This book is in- 
spected weekly and all necessary corrections made.

Milk, eggs, fat meats, butter, potatoes (in excess),

fowl), two coarse vegetables (beets, carrots, turnips, 
parsnips, sweet potatoes, cabbage, green beans or peas, 
sweet corn, radishes, tomatoes, lettuce, etc.), and 
stewed fruit. 

Dinner: Meat (beefsteak, lamb chop, fish or fowl), 
two coarse vegetables, fruit salad, coffee or tea. 

In acne rosacea one employs much the same scheme. 
In these cases, the harmful effect of alcohol is probably 
more appart-.c than in any other skin disease. In acne 
rosacea alcohol seems to exert its action especially on 
the circulation, and it is very common to see the red 
"whiskey nose" in alcoholics, although the excessive 
use of any other stimulant, as tea or coffee, can pro- 
duce the same picture. 



PSORIASIS 

A vegetable diet has been recommended for many 
years for patients with psoriasis. In some cases one 
obtains results with such a regime^ but the majority 
of psoriatics fail to respond to any special diet. We 
do know, however, that patients with psoriasis, 
especially the acute form, improve on a low protein 
diet, and Schamberg has shown a nitrogen retention 
which diminishes as the patient improves or recovers. 
Perhaps these individuals improve in the summer be- 
cause of the restricted meat and protein diet during 
that season. Alcohol has been known to aggravate 
or start anew^ an attack of psoriasis. Coffee, cocoa, 
chocolate, because of their xanthin content, are harmful 
in psoriasis. 

URTICARIA 

Hives, which might well be called the "great tor- 
mentor*' are so common as to warrant considerable at- 
tention. Unfortunately for the sufferer from hives, 
scientific knowledge of the condition is limited, as is 
evident from the numerous methods of cure and the 
chronicity of many cases. The acute attack of hives 
commonly follows some indiscretion in diet, and 
usually is quickly relieved by prompt emptying of the 
gastro-intestinal canaL Some persons can produce an 
attack at will by eating a particular article of food — 
one man cannot eat berries, another can produce hives 
by eating fish food, a third has an idiosyncrasy to 
some other article of diet 



DISEASES THE SKIN. 



219 



Chronic urticaria may develop after an acute attack, 
but in by no means all cases can a definite article of 
food be discovered as the cause. It has seemed to us 
that perhaps medical men have gone too far in assum- 
ing a food insult as the cause of most cases of chronic 
urticaria; certainly in many cases we have over-em- 
phasized the food element at the expense of the direct 
skin condition. This is an angio-neurosis — an effusion 
of serum through the skin capillaries, and the direct 
cause of the effusion is some instability in the minute 
nerves controlling the capillaries. Food often plays 
a primary role, but on the other hand the condition can 
occur apparently as a pure neurosis. 

It is no small task to prove whether any particular 
food element is at the bottom of chronic urticaria, or 
what the particular food is. ^ In some cases, as in acute 
urticaria, the patient knows that his hives appear when 
he eats fresh fruits or meat, and in such cases the cure 
is easy. The patient may be "tested out" by a dietary 
regime which, starting with purgation and starvation is 
gradually an9 carefully increased by the addition of one 
article of food at a time. Sometimes the offender may 
be caught in this manner, or it may be possible to vac- 
cinate the patient with numerous foods. If he is "sen- 
sitive" to a particular food he will respond- with a 
characteristic "wheal" at the site of the vaccination. 
Since it is difficult to procure material for vaccination 
from all kinds of food, this procedure will not always 
be successful. 



As a routine practical procedure to detect a possible 
cause of hives we ha\ e usually first completely starv- 
ed and purged our patient, g^iving nothing but water 
for one or two days. Milk is then given, often with 
buttermilk (Bulgarian Bacillus). Then bread, the 
various cereals, first without sugar; the various vege- 
tables, fruits, meats, etc., are added always one at a 
time; but often despite such a course we have been 
unable to locate a definite food idiosyncrasy. In fact, 
we have seen patients do better on a full unrestricted 
diet than on a smaller fare, and in these cases it has 
seemed unwise to continue the tests. In some cases, 
however, we have found definite food causes, as fresh 
fruit or vegetables, animal protein in any form. In 
these cases it is good policy to attempt to find an even 
more remote pathological condition whose presence 
makes the food poisonous for the individual; this 
may be a disturbance in the gastro-intestinal canal 
or even an infection in some other part of the body. 
From our experience w^ith food idiosyncrasies of vari- 
ous sorts we firmly believe that such an apparent idio- 
syncrasy may be only a secondary metabolic expression. 
This idiosyncrasy will be manifest until the primary 
cause is discovered and removed, 

FURUNCULOSIS 

In furunculosis an excess of sugar may be found in 
the blood. This conforms to our clinical observation 
that furuncles are common in individuals who over- 
eat carbohydrates. It is therefore advisable to limit 



DISEASES THE SKIN. 



221 



the ingestion of sugars and starches in such patients; 
the "carbohydrate-free diets/' given in Chapter III, will 
be found useful. In many patients who resist ordin- 
ary therapeutic methods resort to such a diet will be 
followed by an immediate cure. 



CHAPTER XII. 



FEVERS 

We can hardly talk about feeding in fevers unless 
we modify our remarks to suit the special case. Fever 
is usually the result of an infection, and both the fever 
and the poisoning of an infection increase the body 
metabolism. In some cases where the disease is of 
short duration, this increased metabolism and the re- 
sulting loss of body weight are not of as great im- 
portance to the patient as are other considerations ; for 
example, pneumonia is usually a disease of such short 
duration and uncomplicated convalescence that we need 
not fear the temporary loss of weight which might re- 
sult from a diet used to spare the heart. On the other 
hand, typhoid fever is a long and tedious drain on the 
patient who needs to conserve all his energy if he is 
successfully to overcome the infection and pass 
through convalescence without relapse. In typhoid 
fever, one of the most important elements in treatment 
should be a deliberate attempt to maintain nutrition, 
but in pneumonia this is of minor importance as com- 
pared to the. danger of cardiac insufficiency, or even of 
meteorism — intestinal putrefaction and gas. In other 
fevers, too, special stress is laid on other features, as for 
example scarlet fever, where the diet and all treatment 
must always have in view the danger of its most seri- 
ous complication — nephritis. 

(223) 



224 ' FOOD If OR THE SICK. 

It seems evident, then, that there can be no definite 
diet for fever, no set of rules to govern all cases. In 
the acute infections of short duration often one of the 
most marked symptoms is loss of appetite, and in such 
cases it is obviously unwise to try to force food. The 
use of liquid foods in these cases has the double ad- 
vantag^e of being usually more easily assimilated and 
digested than solids and of furnishing a larger amount 
of water. Some patients show a peculiar capricious- 
ness of appetite during fever, and it is probably true 
that no harm will arise if the demand for strange foods 
be answered. In fact, generally speaking, the appe- 
tite and desires of the patient must be considered even 
uiien fluids alone are employed^ and the comfort and 
well-being of tl^e patient more often depend on the 
art of the cook than on the orders of the physician. 

It is not ahvays easy to furnish a suitable fluid diet, 
which is especially true wlien for some reason milk 
is not well borne. When milk is part of the diet it, 
of course, forms the basis of any fluid regime; but 
it rarely can be used extensively for any period of 
time without variations. Milk can be used in so many 
different ways, pleasing to a patient who dislikes it 
pure, that w^e have collected in this cliapter many 
recipes, some of which are sure to prove satisfactory. 
The various modificaHons of milk now extensively 
used in the sick room, as, for example, malted milk or 
buttermilk, also furnish excellent material for a fluid 
diet Raw eggs, either whole or merely the albumen, 
can be served alone or combined with various drinks; 



FEVERS. 225 

stock soups and meat extracts, while of little value as 
fuel, have considerable value as stimulators of appe- 
tite and for their water content. 

Alcoholic beverages are rarely necessary as food, 
except when the patient has been a heavy drinker. 
Occasionally champagne will be of value when noth- 
ing else is retained by the stomach, and enough brandy, 
whiskey or sherry to flavor a milk drink will often 
stimulate an otherwise sluggish appetite. There are 
times when alcohol is necessary as a stimulant — in 
which cases it is given not as a food but as medicine. 
Tea or coflFee are used at the discretion of the physi- 
cian. Fruit juices and the **soft" drinks are useful 
adjuncts to a liquid diet and will help considerably in 
adding variety. 

The class of cases for which such a liquid diet is 
suitable are the acute uncomplicated fevers of short 
duration. In this group we include the acute infec- 
tions of the upper air passages — ^tonsilitis, "cold in the 
head," influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia; some of the 
more acute "contagious diseases," as for example — 
measles, mumps, meningitis, diphtheria, erysipelas, 
etc. Acute articular rheumatism in its earlier stages 
may also be classified in this heading. 

If a liquid diet is ordered, it is well to plan a diet 
on a two-hour schedule, and, as already mentioned, 
especial attention should be paid to the requirements 
of the individual appetite. Certainly care in selecting 
some of the appended preparations will be gratefully 
appreciated by the patient.

234 MOD FOR *tHt SICK, 

Some physicians never consider it necessary to limit 
a diet strictly to fluids^ and from the beginning of an 
acute infection they allow the addition of *'soft" 
articles of food, as, for example, strained cereals, 
vegetable purees, soft tOTSt (milk or broth), stewed 
fruits, mashed potato, gelatines, etc. Whether one 
agrees with this practice or not, it is certainly true that 
as soon as the acute process is over additions such as 
these to the diet should be made as quickly as the pa- 
tient's appetite allow^s. A "soft'* diet would embrace the 
fluids already discussed and any of the following 
articles : 

Milk toastj soft eggs, custards and other soft milk 
puddings, ices and ice creams, strained vegetables and 
fruits, mashed potato, strained cereals, butter

12 P. M. and 4 A. M. 

Milk 6 oz. with i oz. cream if patient is

As convalescence is established and the patient ap- 
proaches the normal, the diet is gradually or rapidly 
increased, depending entirely on the general welfare 
and appetite of the individual. At the close of any 
uncomplicated infection it can be said that a normal 
full diet cannot be reached too quickly. In influenza, 
for example, the drop in temperature to normal usually 
means the end of the disease, but the patient is apt to 
be more profoundly weakened than he realizes, and his 
diet should be increased rapidly. After the crisis in 
pneumonia complications usually are not encountered 
unless it be empyema; but the severe cardiac strain 
prevents too rapid an increase in food. As we have 
already said, the details of increasing food must be 
established for the individual case ; but as an example 
of the general method we usually employ we shall now 
cite the diet we usually employ with our pneumonia 
patients :

^ooD :roR mt SICK, 



If milk IS well borne it should form the major part 
of the diet during the acute stage of the disease- 
Plenty of water should be giv^en also and acid bev- 
erages are very valuable during the severe stage. 

As frequent feedings are necessary, 4 to 6 ounces of 
milk may be given every 2 or 3 hours. Gradually, as 
the fever abates, semi-solid food may be added to the 
diet. In some cases we have had very good success 
in feeding the high caloric diet which we use for 
typhoid fever. Then the return to a full diet is sim- 
ilar also. If milk is not well borne, broths, whey^ 
malted milk, egg albumin and liquid beef preparations 
must be used. Starches and sugars are not well borne 
usually, and so are best omitted from the diet, 

TYPHOID FEVER 

At present the standard diet for typhoid fever pa- 
tients is a so-called **high caloric" diet. The adoption 
of this type of diet is based primarily on the facts (i) 
that the long continued fever and intoxication of the 
infection increase metabolism and reduce weight by 
burning of body fat and protein, (2) this loss of weight 
and strength lowers the resistance of the patient, and 
(3) to a great extent it can be prevented by proper 
diet. The food should, of course, be easily digested 
and assimilated, and should contain no coarse residue 
which entering the intestine might irritate or ev^en rup- 
ture the ulcers constantly present in this disease. The 
older method of feeding milk or milk and albumen 
water was based on the idea that solid food would in- 



FEVERS. 



239 



crease the fever and would be more dangerous to the 
inflamed intestine than was milk; but it is true that 
milk entering the stomacK a liquid may enter the in- 
testine a curdled, solid mass, whereas a mashed po- 
tato or a dish of gelatine may be liquified by the time 
the inflamed intestine is reached. Practical tests at 
the bedside have now shown conclusively that we 
need not fear complications when we feed our ty- 
phoid patients liberally, but that on the other hand 
complications are less likely to occur, convalescence is 
shortened, and the patient recovers from the disease 
more nearly like a human being than a starved skele- 
ton. 

It is, however, often difficult to make the typhoid 
fever patient take his food, and all sorts of dietary 
artifices may be necessary to suit his appetite and his 
digestion. Frequent feeding of small amounts is more 
likely to succeed than trying to give a few large meals, 
and for that reason the patient should be given some- 
thing every two hours; although we do not believe it 
a wise practice to disturb his slumber at night for food 
unless we cannot get him to eat during the day. 
Especially in the beginning of the disease it is often 
difficult to force the patient to eat, and yet this is the 
most important time to establish his schedule, for 
if the patient acquires the habit early it is much 
simpler to continue later when food is needed. 

We have used the following high caloric diets in the 
Michael Reese Hospital with good success. The pa- 
tients on the whole have taken the food well, and when

As this diet is liberal, we increase the diet very 
slowly during convalescence. A little apple sauce is 
added with the breakfast, no other change being made 
for a few days. Then we add a small amount of 
strained mashed potato to the noon meal. Strained 
peas or some other light vegetable is next added, and 
lastly a small amount of minced chicken ; within a few 
days scraped beef or minced fish are alternated with the 
chicken to afford a variety. We very often give the 
patient a gastro-intestinal diet (see page 169) before 
giving more solid food, then very gradually change 
the diet so that he receives stewed fruit and vegetables 
without straining. Raw food should be avoided for 
weeks and sometimes months after the patient is able 
to leave the hospital. 

Some physicians still use milk almost entirely 
through the acute stage of typhoid fever, so we give 
Coleman's Milk, Cream and Lactose Diets as ex- 
amples of the fluid diet.

SCARLET FEVER 

A special word is necessary concerning scarlet fever, 
because, as we have already stated, in scarlet we always 
fear and must try to prevent the onset of nephritis. 
On account of the fear of this serious complication, 
milk for years has been the accepted food for patients 
with this disease, but in more recent times careful com- 
parative studies of parallel series of patients have 
shown that a more liberal diet does not increase the in- 
cidence of nephritis. It seems to us, however, that 
some caution should be exercised and that the patient 
should be guarded, and at least during the height of 
the fever milk should form the main article of food. 
If the patient is not too sick the addition of some soft 
foods of the farinaceous type, or stewed fruits, or of 
vegetable purees can not possibly do harm and can be 
given from the beginning. As soon as the fever sub- 
sides the patient should receive enough food to main- 
tain nutrition, but despite the investigations quoted 
above we believe it wise to refrain from excessive use 
of protein or of salt. Although protein and salt may 
not be potentially dangerous, yet it is better to err on 
the side of caution, especially since enough calories can 
easily be supplied without protein. 

A diet scheme on this basis would not be difficult to 
construct: reference to the lists already given in this 
chapter will supply the information needed. 

"RHEUMATISM " 

"Rheumatism" is a word which by itself has no 
place in the literature of medicine ; we use it here simply 



244 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 



as a convenient handle for a group of diseases com- 
monly and erroneously classed together, and we use 
it mainly to show the error of this grouping. For 
this word as too often employed is made to embrace 
everything or anything whfch causes pain in the mus- 
cles or joints. Excepting gout, which has been dis- 
cussed, there is nothing in the course of rheumatic 
troubles which suggests metabolic disturbances. The 
acute arthritis cases should be treated as ordinary acute 
fevers (see page 225) ; the chronic joint disturbances 
should receive as much good nourishing food as pos- 
sible, just as other chronic infectious diseases are fed 
up in the effort to increase resistance. The so-called 
muscular rheumatism is usually the result of an inflam- 
matory reaction in the muscles to some absorbed toxin, 
and diet can have little, if any, effect on its course. 



CHAPTER XIII. 



OBESITY 

The dietary problem of most general popular in- 
terest is the one associated with obesity. Every fat 
person wants to grow thin, but few are willing to 
work toward that end or to make; sacrifices to do so. 
There are patients whom one wants to reduce for 
definite medical reasons, but most persons who diet 
for obesity have a pure cosmetic motive. The prob- 
lem of why some persons are stout and others thin 
is as yet unsolved ; we know of course that a tendency 
to obesity or to thinness may run in families, but we 
do not know the basic reason for this tendency. We 
call this an hereditary constitutional tendency, which 
in terms of metabolism means nothing. Not all stout 
persons are by any means heavy eaters, and not all 
heavy eaters are stout; but despite this apparent fact 
obesity arises from a disproportion between the amount 
of food taken and the amount actually burned by the 
body. A woman approaching her menopause may 
put on fat although she does not change her diet in 
any way ; and in this case there is probably a diminish- 
ed use of food because of deep chemical changes re- 
sulting from the diminished ovarian secretion. On 
the other hand the athlete at the training table eating a 
carefully selected diet and taking plenty of exercise 
will stay "fit," but allow him to stop exercise and to 
eat more freely and he will "put on flesh.'* In the 

(245)

case of the woman at " the menopause there is no 
change in food intake, and the obesity results from a 
disturbance of body metabolism : in the case of the 
athlete, increased weight results from a combination 
of two factors (1) increased food and (2) diminished 
energy. On the other hand a man who all of his life 
has been accustomed to a sparse diet, but who sud- 
denly becomes prosperous and eats accordingly is 
very likely to grow fat merely because he increases 
his fcK>d supply, without correspondingly increasing 
his energy. 

So then the causes of obesity may be summarized 
in brief as follows: (i) a constitutional tendency, (2) 
overeating, (3) diminished expense of energy, (4) a 
combination of 2 and 3. 

It is not always easy to prove that an obese person 
belongs to one of the groups 2, 3 or 4. Many men 
and women really think they do not overeat and do 
take enough exercise, and when asked to put on paper 
the exact amount of food they consume, the exercise 
they take, the alcohol they drink, and the amount of 
sleep they indulge in are greatly surprised at the 
physician's proof of their over-eating. This attitude 
is of course not an attempt to deceive, but is merely 
the result of ignorance of food values. If careful in- 
quiry into the details of ordinary life be made in all 
obese patients, many, apparently constitutionally fat, 
will prove to be obese because of a disproportion be- 
tween food intake and energy consumed. 

In all cases the principle of the cure will be the

same, but the application will have to vary for the in- 
dividual patient. The foods from which fat is most 
easily made are the carbohydrates and the fats, the 
main ingredients of those foods which stout persons 
enjoy most. The fundamental concept in treatment 
then will be the reduction of the amount of carbohy- 
drates and fats in the diet. But it is not sufficient to 
tell a fat person merely to restrain from fat-forming 
foods; other foods must be provided to take their 
place. In those cases where an evident excess of 
sweets such as candy, pastry or ice-cream is the cause 
of the trouble, and where the aim of treatment is 
merely to prevent further increase in weight, it is 
often necessary merely to remove the noxious sweets 
from the diet. In most cases, however, excessive detail 
must be provided. It is not sufficient to tell a patient 
to eat much protein and many vegetables; you have 
to write out his menus for him. The success of a 
certain popular method of achieving thinness is due to 
the fact that diets are printed; the patient does not 
have to devote any energy to figuring out what he 
may or may not eat; he is told from day to day and 
week to week what to eat, and he is urged to follow 
the menus without change — except perhaps of taste.. 

There are many cures for obesity, most of which 
are given at the end of this chapter. Most of them 
are too strenuous for ordinary usage, and some are not 
without potential harm. It is our practice in handling 
such cases to employ the following method : 
I. Get a detailed diary of the patient's life. 



248 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 



II. Kxamine patient 
IIL Using this as a basis for correction, prescribe 
(a) the amount of sleep; (b) the amount of exercise; 
(c) the diet. In figuring^ out the diet we (i) dimin- 
ish the total caloric intake ; (2) diminish intake of fats 
and carbohydrates to a minimum compatible with the 
health of the individual and his occupation; (3) con- 
trol the water intake. 

Speaking of the last element first, we do not feel 
that excessive restriction of fluids helps greatly in all 
cases, but occasionally water restriction is found neces- 
sary. Drinking at meals, being a bad habit at best, is 
not allowed, but tiie more recent studies clearly show 
that only in certain exceptional cases does water intake 
really influence metabolism. 

In giving the various known "obesity cures'' we wish 
again to emphasize that indiscriminate dieting for 
obesity is a procedure not entirely devoid of danger. 
We do not believe that any person should undertake 
treatment except under the advice and care of a physi- 
cian. With proper guidance good results can be ob- 
tained without the harm which may result from too ex- 
cessive employment of inanition, A cure which re- 
duces slowly is better, safer, and more permanent than 
any radical one.

CHAPTER XIV. 



ANEMIA, SCURVY AND GOITRE 
ANEMIA 

It is necessary briefly to discuss anemia as a pri- 
mary and a secondary condition. When anemia is sec- 
ondary the underlying^ disease must be treated and the 
diet prescribed to suit the demands of the primary 
disturbance. We cannot treat the anemia which ac- 
companies nephritis in the same way as. we treat the 
anemia of acute articular rheumatism ; in nephritis the 
very nature of the disease imposes limitations beyond 
which we dare not trespass in any effort to increase 
the blood (see page 105) ; in rheumatism no such bar- 
rier to our progress exists. Where we can prescribe 
for the anemia itself we order a well balanced full diet 
in which protein and the fresh vegetables and fruits 
play an important role. The medicinal use of iron or 
of arsenic usually indicated can be supplemented by 
the foods richer in iron. 

The iron content of some foods can be seen from 
the two tables given below. 

Milligrams of iron in 100 grams fresh material. (Bouis- 
singault). 

Meat 37.5 Potatoes 6.6 

Lentils 8.3 Egg 5.7

Both these tables are copied from Friedenwald and Ruhrah^ 

But as we have already freely discussed under tuber- 
culosis, in giving a full diet we must consider the 
patient's stomach and intestines. A full diet given 
to a stomach unable to digest it is of no avail to the 
patient, and for that reason any special condition of 
the stomach or intestine should be looked for and 
treated, 

PRIMARY PERNICIOUS ANEMIA 

In treating pernicious anemia it must be borne in 
mind that often the disease is accompanied by an ab- 
sence of gastric juice and by symptoms of intestinal 
indigestion. For these reasons diet forms an impor- 
tant part of treatment, but owing to the accompany- 
ing gastro-intestinal disturbances it can not always be 
directed to the anemia. The patient whose stomach 
rebels at meat should not be told to eat raw beef, no

matter how much theoretical good can be obtained 
from raw beef; nor should the carbohydrates be 
forced on another patient if they produce flatulence 
and discomfort. When a patient with pernicious 
anemia is in the remission stage, that is when the dis- 
ease may be said to be active and acute, the food prob- 
lem is to give him as nourishing a diet as he will eat 
and digest. If he can eat a full diet so much the bet- 
ter, but if he has achylia gastrica we must feed him for 
the stomach condition.

Soups: Meat soups and cream soups. 

Meats: Finely divided beef, lamb and chicken.

Then as soon as improvement begins to be mani-

changed; and in arriving at a full diet special atten- 
tion should be paid to the value of the animal proteins 
as blood producers. In a diet for anemia, either sec-

FOOD i?OR The stck. 



SCURVY 

Scurvy is a disease due to the absence in the food 
of certain elements found in fresh fruit veg^etables 
and meats. Formerly a common invader of camps 
and prisons, an unwelcome guest on long boat jour- 
neys, a dreaded accompaniment of exploring parties 
it has retreated before the advance of modern hygiene 
and preventive medicine and is a comparatively rare 
disease. Occasionally, ho%vever, it is still seen in in- 
fants improperly fed, or in adults whose diets for rea- 
sons of illness or ignorance have been poorly chosen. 
We have seen typical scurvy in a rich farmer whose 
meals consisted almost entirely of tea, biscuits and 
canned goods. The cure is complete when fresh vege-- 
tables, fresh fruits and fresh meat are added to the 
diet, 

GOITRE 

Just a few words are necessary concerning the diet, 
in goitre. In the simple enlargement of the thyroid 
gland so frequently seen in certain geographic loca- 
tions, as for instance along the Great Lakes, not infre- 
quently a considerable reduction in the goitre will 
results from the rule drink no water unless it is boiled 
or distilled/' We know no special dietary indications 
for this condition. 

Exophthalmic goitre has been the subject of much 
metabolic study and the center of more dietary discus- 
sion. An increased metabolism has been proved as a 
fact, but the use of special forms of diet usually has 
been prompted by theory. In our experience we have 



ANEMIA, SCURVY AND GOITRE. 265 



not satisfied ourselves that any particular form of food 
was either distinctly beneficial or distinctly harmful, 
and we have merely advised a plentiful diet. DuBois 
in the most recent metabolic study of this disease has 
shown that an exophthalmic goitre patient requires 
from 154 to 2 times as much food as a normal person. 
He was unable to show a particularly beneficial effect 
from any of the food elements. 

The theory has been advanced by some physicians 
that goitre may be benefited by a lacto-vegetarian diet. 
In this diet all flesh foods are prohibited and vege- 
tables and milk and eggs make up the diet. We have 
no evidence of benefit derived from this diet, but in 
some cases it may be beneficial and worthy of a trial.

trations, 175 ill colors. Cloth, J 8, 00 net; Half Morocco, 

$9.50 net. Piiblislied Anguse, lOlS 

SECOND EDITION 

You will pronounce this new book the most elaborate^ the most supe'-bly 
illustrated work on Obstetrics you have ever seen. Especially will you value 
ihe 938 illustrations, all, with but few exceptions, origiual, and the best work 
of leading medical artists. Some 175 of these illustrations are in color. 
Such a magniHcent collection of obstetric pictures — and with reaUy pratHci^ 
fmw^has never before appeared in one book* 

You will find the text extremely practical throughout Diagnosis is fea* 
tnred, and the relations of ol:^tetric conditions and accidents to general medi- 
cine, surgery, and the specialties are brought into prominence. 

Regarding: Trtntmmt: Yon get here the verj' latest advances in this field, 
and yon can rest assured every method of L'eatment, every step in operative 
technic^ is just right* Dr. DeLee's twenty-one years* experience as a teacher 
ftnd obstetrician guarantees this^ 

Worthy of your particular attention are the descriptive legends under the 
illastrations. These are nnu?iually full, and by studying the pictures serially 
with their detailed legends you are better able to follow the operations than 
by referring tO the pictures from a distant text— the usual method.

INCLUDING SURGERY Or NEWBORN 

Dr. Davis' new work on Operative Obstetrics is a most practical one, and 
no expense has been spared to make it the handsomest work on the subject 
as well. Every step in every operation is described minutely, and the technic 
shown by beautiful new illustrations. The section given over to surgery of 
the newborn you will find unusually valuable. It gives you much informa- 
tion you want to know — facts you can use in your work every day. There 
is an excellent chapter on anesthesia in obstetrics. 

The Lancet, London

THIRD COITION— 60 PAGCS ON INTERNAL SECRETIONS 

This new work by Dr. Bandler is just the book that the physician en- 
gaged in general practice has long needed. It is truly the practitioner' s gyne- 
cology — planned for him, written for him, and illustrated for him. There are 
many gynecologic conditions that do not call for operative treatment ; yet, 
because of lack of that special knowledge required for their diagnosis and 
treatment, the general practitioner has been unable to treat them intelligently. 
This work gives just the information the practitioner needs. 
American Journal of Obitetrics 

" He has shown good judgment in the selection of his data. He has placed most 
emphasis on diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. He has presented his facts in a manner 
to be readily grasped by the general practitioner." 



Bandler's Vaginal Celiotomy 

Vaginal Celiotomy. By S. Wyllis Bandler, M. D. Octavo 
of 450 pages, with 148 illustrations. Cloth, ^5 00 net. 

SUPERB ILLUSTRATIONS 

The vaginal route, because of its simplicity, ease of execution, absence of 
shock, more certain results, and the opportunity for conservative measures, 
constitutes a field which should appeal to all surgeons, gynecologists, and 
obstetricians. Posterior vaginal celiotomy is of great importance in the re- 
moval of small tubal and ovarian tumors and cysts, and is an important step 
in the performance of vaginal myomectomy, hysterectomy, and hystero- 
myomectomy. Anterior vaginal celiotomy with thorough separation of f'ie 
bladder is the only certain method of correcting cystocele. January, 1911 

The Lancet. London 

*' Dr. Bandler has done good service in writing this book, which gives a very clear 
description of all the operations which may be undertaken through the vagina. He makes 
out a strong case for these operations."

Kelly and Noble's Gynecolo^ 
and Abdominal Sur|(ery 

Gynecology and Abdominal Surgery. Edited by Howard 
A.. Kelly, M. D., Professor of Gynecology in Johns Hopkins 
University; and Charles P. Noble, M.D., formerly Clinical 
Professor of Gynecology in the Woman's Medical College, Phila- 
delphia. Two imperial octavo volumes of 850 pages each, con- 
taining 880 illustrations, mostly original. Per volume : Cloth, 
$8.00 net ; Halt Morocco, $9.50 net. Volume I published May, 
1907; Volume II published June, 1908. 

WITH 880 ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIONS BY HERMANN BECKER 
AND MAX BRODEL 

In view of the intimate association of gynecology with abdominal surgery 
the editors have combined these two important subjects in one work. For 
this reason the work will be doubly valuable, for not only the gynecologist and 
general practitioner will find it an exhaustive treatise, but the surgeon also will 
find here the latest technic of the various abdominal operations. It possesses 
a number of valuable features not to be found in any other publication cover- 
ing the same fields. It contains a chapter upon the bacteriology and one upon 
the pathology of gynecology, dealing fully with the scientific basis of gyne- 
cology. In no other work can this information, prepared by specialists, be 
found as separate chapters. There is a large chapter devoted entirely to 
medical gynecology^ written especially for the physician engaged in general 
practice. Heretofore the general practitioner was compelled to search through 
an entire work in order to obtain the information desired. Abdominal stir- 
gery proper, as distinct from gynecology, is fully treated, embracing operations 
upon the stomach, upon the intestines, upon the liver and bile-ducts, upon the 
pancreas and spleen, upon the kidney, ureter, bladder, and the peritoneum. 
Special attention has been given to modern technic. The illustrations are the 
work of Mr. Hermann Becker and Mr. Max Brddel. 

American Journal of the Medical Sciences 

" It is needless to say that the work has been thorou|;hly done : the names of ^he authors 
and editors would guarantee this ; but much may be said in praise of the method of presen- 
tation, and attention mav be called to the inclusion of matter not to be found elsewhere."

FOR THE PRACTITIONER 

Dr. Webster has written this work especially for the general practitioner, 
discussing the clinical features of the subject in their widest relations to 
general practice rather than from the standpoint of specialism. The magni- 
ficent illustrations, three hundred and seventy-two in number, are nearly all 
original. Drawn by expert anatomic artists under Dr. Webster's direct super- 
vision, they portray the anatomy of the parts and the steps in the operations 
with rare clearness and exactness. Published January, 1907 

Howard A. Kelly* Prqfesfr ^Gynecologic Surgery, Johns Hopkin* University, 

** It is undoubtedly one of the best works which has been put on the market within

ACCURATE 

Regularly every year a new edition of this excellent text-book is called 
for, and it appears to be in as great favor with physicians as with students. 
Indeed, this book has taken its place as the ideal work for the general prac- 
titioner. The author presents the best teaching of modern gynecology, un- 
trammeled by antiquated ideas and methods. In every case the most modem 
and progressive technique is adopted, and the main points are made clear by 
excellent illustrations.

PREFACE 



In the preparation of this volume we have sup- 
plemented our own experience by free use of the current 
literature in text-books and magazines. Since the na- 
ture of the book precludes extensive bibliographical 
references, we take this opportunity of acknowledging 
our indebtedness. To many of our colleagues on the 
staff of Michael Reese Hospital we owe debts of grati- 
tude for suggestions and help ; Dr. Joseph C. Friedman 
has given us much valuable assistance ; the chapter on 
Diseases of the Heart was planned by Dr. Sidney 
Strauss; throne on Diseases of the Skin was outlined 
by Dr. Phillip F. Shaffner. The publishers have con- 
stantly extended courtesies for which we are sincerely 

thankful.

FOOD FOR THE SICK 



CHAPTER I. 
INTRODUCTION 

The conceptions behind this little book are ( i ) that 
the patient may justly demand more explicit instruc- 
tions in diet than he has hitherto received; (2) the 
physician needs a practical guide book for imparting 
such instructions, especially when the patient must rely 
on himself or his family for the preparation of his diet. 
It has seemed to us that many diseases in which food 
plays an important role in treatment do not progress 
favorably because of the inability of the patient to 
grasp in terms of the kitchen what the physician says 
in terms of the laboratory. A cook book does not fill 
this need any more than does an elaborate treatise on 
the science of dietetics, which many physicians find 
difficulty in mastering. 

As an example, the meaning of a "low-nitrogenous, 
salt-free diet" is rarely so clear, that a patient with 
Bright's disease may leave an institution, where he has 
had an elaborate cure, with definite knowledge of what 
he is to eat in the future. He must either follow 
rather blindly the diet sheets of his cure, or ask 
for instructions which to be successful must go 
into questions of cause and effect, of food values, of 
building menus, of special cookery. In giving de- 

(II) 



12 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

tailed instructions the physician of to-day assumes a 
standard of intelligent co-operation with the patient 
which is far removed from the attitude of mystery too 
often adopted in discussions of diet and disease. One 
thing- is certain: Good results in treatment can not 
be attained as long as food as a means of cure is 
shrouded in mystery, as long as the patient is ignorant 
of the fundamental principles of his cure; he must 
learn how to make the science of nutrition and the art 
of cooking work hand in hand for his good. 

Probably both physician and patient will ask : Can 
this be done with safety? The physician may doubt 
his own ability to impart implicit instructions, the 
patient may doubt his own intelligence. But to us the 
answer to these doubts has been found in the experi- 
ences in the past years acquired in the treatment nf 
diabetes mellitus. Where formerly we advised our 
patients in general terms, gave them diet lists and told 
them to report occasionally, in more recent days we 
have instructed our patient in the details of the dis- 
ease, the relation of articles of diet to various effects ; 
we have given him enough of the fundamental science 
to at least control his own case; we have guided him 
through the intricacies of food values ; we have shown 
him how to figure equivalents; we have taken him or 
his wife through the diet kitchen — and on the whole 
have educated him to be our assistant rather than 
merely our bhnd follower. Now, if this revelation has 
been possible in the most difficult of all dietary diseases, 
it ought to be possible in all diseases in which the diet 



INTRODUCTION. 13 

feature is important. We believe that this is not only 
possible, but most desirable, and in our book we hope 
to offer the bridge over which safe passage may be 
made from institutional treatment, with all its controls, 
to home treatment, with all its apparent dangers. 

Since this book is to be written for the perusal of 
physician and patient, it must be constructed from the 
patient's as well as from the physician's point of view, 
and written in language which the patient will be able 
to understand. At the same time, it must adhere to 
the strictest tenets of true science. But we shall 
avoid the mistake of confusing science with theory, and 
theory will be brought in only when absolutely neces- 
sary to prove a fact. For our purpose, we might 
imply by science the "knowing why", and by art the 
"knowing how" of feeding. To know how to diet for 
obesity is not the same thing as to know why the diet 
is prescribed; but we shall consider that we have not 
filled our purpose unless we can show both the "why" 
and the "how." 

The plan of the book, then, must be very definite. 
Each chapter will be devoted to a single subject, and 
we shall first discuss the disease or the condition in 
such a way as to make plain the reasons for the dietary 
rules which follow. Complete details of the diet will 
then be given, with instructions in preparing foods and 
many menus. The first chapter will be devoted to a 
description of the normal use of food, and to lessons 
in practical application of food tables in building any 
kind of special menus. The succeeding chapters oti 



14 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

disease will aim to be scientific and practical, and to 
be the means of assuring confidence to both physician 
and patient : to the physician the confidence which goes 
with an assurance that his instructions are in "black 
and white"; to the patient the confidence which goes 
with knowledge. 



CHAPTER II. 
FOOD AND ITS USES 

It is a fact that in many diseases diet has largel)' 
taken the place of medication, and for this reason too 
much stress cannot be laid upon the .value of a knowl- 
edge of the different classes of foods and the role which 
they play in nutrition of the body. A very pertinent 
question then arises: What is food? Food is any- 
thing which, when taken into the body, is able to fur- 
nish heat or energy or material for repairing waste of 
the body and of building new tissue. 

No clear ideas of either the need or the regulation 
of diets in disease can be possible to one who has not 
some conception of the use of food by the normal in- 
dividual. The mere putting of food in the stomach 
through the mouth is only a" preliminary step, but most 
of us do not stop to consider why we eat, why we 
select certain foods to form our normal day's diet, or 
what happens to the foods we do eat. By what pro- 
cesses are foods handled so that part leaves the body 
in the stools and part is used for the nourishment of 
its different parts? All these questions, and more, 
arise as soon as one attempts to study the reasons for 
diet in any special disease, 

-Very briefly, then, the use of food by the body will 
be explained. The first step in this process is diges- 
tion, and by digestion is meant the preparation of food 
in the mouth, the stomach, and the intestines (the 

(IS) 



l6 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

gastro-intestinal canal), so that it can be taken up or 
absorbed by the blood and assimilated by the body. 
Let us take a piece of roast beef, for example. In the 
condition in which it is put into the mouth the body 
can not use roast beef for its needs, but by the time the 
digestive juices in the stomach and intestines have done 
their work the beef has been put in shape so that what 
the body can use is easily taken up by the blood, while 
the portion of no use to the body is passed along as 
feces. 

After food has been digested and its utilizable por- 
tion has been assimilated by the body, it has two main 
duties to perform. One, and perhaps the most im- 
portant duty, is to furnish heat and energy to the body, 
in exactly the same way as coal furnishes the energy 
for a furnace or gasoline for an automobile. 

In the many activities of all kinds which fill a per- 
son's life he is constantly using energy. Every time 
a man walks or raises his arm he is performing work, 
and in this respect he is like all machines which must 
have fuel if they are to work. The food a man eats 
supplies the fuel for his work, and the amount of fuel 
he needs will depend to a great extent on the amount 
of work he does. This, of course, explains why per- 
sons taking active exercise or doing an unusual amount 
of work have an increased appetite ; the appetite being 
the signal that extra food is needed. 

But food has another duty to perform which is dif- 
ferent from supplying fuel to an engine. Unlike an 
engine, the human body can use its own parts as fuel. 



FOOD AND ITS USES. 17 

and would soon burn up its own tissues if food were 
not supplied to replace what is lost in ordinary activi- 
ties. Everybody knows how in starvation and in cer- 
tain so-called wasting diseases the' body loses weight. 
The reason the healthy body does not lose weight is 
that the food which has been digested and taken up by 
the blood can be and is used by the body to prevent 
and repair waste as it occurs. If no food is given, the 
body "ea:ts" its own parts in order to furnish food for 
its activities, and there is considerable waste. But 
when foods of the proper sort are given, there is no 
need for this, and consequently there is very little waste. 
However, there is always some loss of the body, and 
this loss is supplied by certain elements in the food. 

In all steps by which the body uses food chemical 
reactions occur just as they do in a chemical labora- 
tory. Most of these are extremely complicated, and 
it is unnecessary to discuss them here. The formation 
of urine represents an important principle in the gen- 
eral chemistry of nutrition, and should be explained. 
We have already stated that food is taken up by the 
blood after digestion, and is in such shape that it can 
be used by the body for two main purposes : ( i ) to 
supply fuel energy; (2) to repair waste and build tis- 
sue. We have further said that all this is actually a 
complex chemical process. Now the blood, in addi- 
tion to carrying digested food to the body organs, 
takes away from these organs what' is left after the 
chemical processes are finished; and this left-over ma- 
terial has to get out of the body. The blood carries 
2 



1 8 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

this to the kidneys, where it is passed out of the body 
as urine. The urine, therefore, represents the results 
of the chemical processes in the body, while the feces 
represents merely the actual part of the food which 
does not get out of the alimentary canal. The chem- 
ical end-products are passed in the urine in solution in 
water, which forms by far the largest amount of any. 
urinary constituent. The water comes either from the 
water we drink or from the food. 

The name used to describe these chemical processes 
by which the body changes food and uses it js "metab- 
olism." This is a general name, used to describe the 
breaking down of food and its rebuilding in the regular 
course of its use by the body. Diabetes is a disease 
of metabolism, because patients with diabetes can not 
use certain foods as a healthy person does, and as a 
result sugar appears in the urine. 

Following this brief review of the use of food by 
the human body, it is necessary to interpret the mean- 
ing of certain terms used in defining foods. 

The body is composed of certain chemical elements. 
Some of the most important ones are carbon, hydro- 
gen, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, calcium, phosphorus and 
sulphur. As the body grows or is destroyed by life 
processes, these must be again supplied, according to 
the demands of the body. These ele-ments are sup- 
plied to the body by the food which we eat. In differ- 
ent foods we find different elements and different com- 
binations of elements. For instance, water is a com- 
bination of hydrogen and oxygen. 



FOOD AND ITS USES. 1 9 

Generally speaking, all foods are classified under 
five main groups or headings : ( i ) Water. (2) Pro- 
tein. (3) Fat. (4) Carbohydrate. (5) Mineral 
matter or salts. 

Practically all food substances contain water; some, 
such as vegetables, as much as 90 per cent. ; others, 
such as the cereals, a small amount. The other food 
groups are complex chemical compounds, which dififer 
from each other in a specific chemical way. Yet it 
would be difficult to give understandable definitions in 
chemical terms, and perhaps a better idea of what the 
names mean will be obtained by a citation of examples. 
Protein, for instance, is the substance forming the 
main part of meat of all kinds, including chicken and 
fish. The white of tgg is almost pure protein. All 
proteins are characterized by the presence of the ele- 
ment nitrogen. Certain vegetables (the legumes), 
such as peas and beans, contain a somewhat high per- 
centage, but most vegetables contain only a negligible 
amount of protein. 

Carbohydrates are found mainly in "starchy" foods, 
such as all flour preparations, the cereals — like oatmeal, 
rice, farina. Sugar is a pure carbohydrate. Vege- 
tables contain a varying amount of carbohydrate ; some, 
such as asparagus, lettuce, tomatoes, having about 3 
per cent. ; others, such as corn or beans, running as 
" high as 20 per cent. Potatoes are alsO' a carbohydrate 
food, as most of the solid matter in potato is carbo- 
hydrate. The fruits, like the vegetables, contain car- 



20 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

bohydrate in different amounts, grape fruit being very 
low, plums and bananas very high. 

The meaning of fat is evident to all, and the most 
common fat used is butter, which is almost pure fat. 
Cream is often spoken of in terms of percentage of 
butter fat as "i$ per cent, cream," "20 per cent, cream." 
Also the fats in meat, the fat in bacon and pork are ap- 
parent examples of "fat" food. All oils, such as olive 
oil, cottonseed oil, are pure fats, and certain nuts are 
particularly rich in fat. 

All these food elements have definite purposes in 
the body. Most foods contain a certain amount of 
each kind (see below, page 22), and a well-regulated 
normal diet will contain the amounts o-f each neces- 
sary to maintain the body at its highest point of effi- 
ciency. The protein food makes up. the repair loss, 
the waste of the body tissues. Graham Lusk^ says : 
"Protein has one property out of all proportion to 
that possessed by the other food stuffs : it very largely 
increases the production of heat in the body. In- 
dividuals maintained on a low protein diet may suf- 
fer intensely from cold. A good piece of beefsteak or 
roast beef will put the heat production on a higher 
level, and a person going out of doors on a cold day 
after a meal high in protein does not feel the cold. 
For the same reason, on a hot summer day, meat will 
be avoided." Carbohydrate is the main fuel of the 
body as it is readily burnt to form heat and energy. 
Fat is also burned, but is also used as storage ma-

FOOD AND ITS USES. 21 

terial, and is laid up as body fat. Water is necessary 
to replace the water in the body which is constantly 
being lost. 

In addition to these most important groups is 
another, the niineral salts, or ash, which is absolutely 
necessary for -growth, and which must be supplied 
properly to nourish certain parts of the body, as the 
bones, the teeth. The mineral salts are distinguished 
from the other food substances in that they are in- 
organic chemical compounds ; that is, they do not con- 
tain the element carbon. In growing childrai they 
are necessary for complete growth; without calcium 
(lime) the bones do not develop; in adult life they 
also play another role, the exact nature of which is 
not quite understood. Salt is the commonest min- 
eral used, and the craving for it by most healthy 
persons is an indication of its requirement by the 
body. Almost all foods contain small amounts of 
mineral salts, and a diet which contained none would 
not only be distasteful, but would sooner or later show 
its effect on the general condition of a person. 

These five groupings, known as food nutrients, then, 
form the most important divisions of food, and, as 
said before, are all necessary to a well-regulated diet. 

As we have said that one function of food is to 
furnish heat for the body, we are much interested in 
knowing the amount of heat which different foods 
will furnish, so that we can more wisely choose our 
food according to occupation, season, climate, etc. 
The heat value of different foods has been determined 



22 



FOOD FOR THE SICK. 



by an instrument called the calorimeter. A small 
amount of food, one gram, is placed in a ball-like ap- 
paratus and immersed in water. The food is burned 
by electricity and a thermometer registers the change 
in the temperature of the water caused by the burning 
of the food. The standard unit of heat production is 
the calorie. This is the amount of heat that is neces- 
sary to raise the temperature of one pound of water 
4° F. Experiinents have proved that one gram of 
protein will produce 4. i calories of heat ; i gram of fat, 
9.3 calories; i gram of carbohydrate, 4.1 calories. 

The question which now naturally arises is how to 
tell the proportions of each food nutrient to be found 
in any paticular food. Fortunately, all this work has 
been done by analytical chemists, and the Department 
of Agriculture of the U. S. Government has issued 
Bulletins, which give complete analyses of most Amer- 
ican food stuffs. The two most valuable of these are 
Farmer's Bulletin, No. 28, which can be obtained by 
sending twelve cents to the Department of Agricul- 
ture, and Farmer's Bulletin, No. 142, which is in part 
copied here.

t Plain confectionery not containing nuts, fruit, or chocolate. 

t Such vegetables as potatoes, squash, beets, etc. , have a certain 
amount of inedible material, skin, seeds, etc. The amount varies with the 
method of preparing the vegetables, and can not be accurately estimated. 
The flgures given for refuse of vegetables, fruit, etc., are assumed to rep- 
resent approximately the amount of refuse in' these foods as ordinarily 
prepared.

♦ Fruits contain a certain proportion of inedible materials, as skin, 
seeds, etc., which are properly classed as refusci In some fruits, as oranges 
and prunes, the amount rejected in eating is practically the same as refuse. 
In others, as apples and pears, more or less of the edible material is ordi- 
narily rejected with the skin and seeds and other inedible' portions. The 
edible material' which is thus thrown away, «,nd should properly be classed 
■with the waste, is here classed with the refuse. The figures for refuse 
here given represent, as nearly as can be ascertained, the quantities ordi- 
narily rejected.

t The average of five analyses of cereal coffee grain is: Water 6.2, 
protein 13.3, fat 3.4, carbohydrates 72.6, and ash 4.5 per cent. Only a por- 
tion of the nutrients, however, enter into the infusion. The average in the 
table represents the available nutrients in the beverage. Infusions of 
genuine coffee and of tea like the above contain practically no nutrients. 

It only requires a little practice to learn how to 
use this table. For example, it is interesting to know 
what an ordinary day's diet will contain. In Bul- 
letin No. 28 the differences between food as bought 
and as served on the table are given, for it is apparent 
that cooking will change the proportions of various 
substapces in some foods. As an example, oatmeal 
when bought is dry, and when finally cooked it will 
take up so much water that one ounce of the dry roll- 
ed oats will make about ten ounces of "oatmeal" 
ready to eat. On the other hand, in broiling meat the 
heat causes the water in the meat to evaporate, so that

there will be less weight when it is ready to eat than 
when it was bought. In the "average" Food values 
given in the table the figures refer to the material as 

. bought, so that in trying to use it we must consider 
the food in the condition in which it is bought. There- 
fore, in learning to use the table for figuring an or- 

~ dinary day's diet, the first thing to do is to put down 
on paper just what is being eaten, then to weigh out 
the amount of food used. In weighing food it is 
much easier to work in terms of grams than in ounces, 
especially when percentages are to be reckoned. All 
that is necessary to know is that one ounce equals ap- 
proximately 30 grams, and one pound equals 480 
grams. If the scales weigh in ounces only, it is easy 
to change the ounce values to grams. 

Having weighed out the total amounts of the various 
foods eaten in a day, we can turn to the table to see 
what they contain in protein, fat, carbohydrate, and 
how many calories are furnished. In an ordinary diet 
we need not consider refuse, water or ash (mineral 
salts). The water and salts usually take care of them- 
selves, because a person adds water and table salt to 
his diet usually to suit his needs or tastes. The refuse 
is of more economic than dietary importance, since, 
naturally, the more refuse one gets in his purchase of 
food, the less he gets to eat for his money. Using 
the diet below as a basis, we see that oatmeal con- 
tains 16.7 per cent, protein, 7.3 per cent, fat and 66.2 
per cent, carbohydrate (in its dried state), and as 
the serving of oatmeal was made from one-half ounce-

oats (15 grams), this amount would contain 16.7 
per cent, of 15 grams=:2.5 grams protein; 7.3 per 
cent, of 15=1 gram fat, and 66.2 per cent, of 15=9.9 
grams carbohydrate.

The caloric value of the food can be estimated in 
either one of two ways : ( i ) From the last columns in 
the table, where the fuel value of each food is given; 
or (2) by adding the total protein, fat and carbo- 
hydrate in the diet and multiplying each by the speci- 
fic figures already explained. In using food tables 
for any work it is necessary to know that they give 
only approximate values, as foods may naturally vary 
considerably in the proportions they contain. A side 
of bacon left hanging in a butcher's shop on a warm 
day will lose water by evaporation, and will therefore 
contain a larger per cent, of solid matter than it did 
when it left the packers. Strawberries will take up 
water after a heavy rain ; the amount of fat in a piece 
of beef will depend on the condition of the steer, and 
milk, of course, will vary a great deal, depending on 
the cow's food. 

Already some question as to what the .term "normal 
diet" means has doubtless arisen in the reader's mind. 



FOOD AND ITS USES 3 1 

Scientists have prepared tables of standard weights 
which they have obtained by actual examination of 
many individuals. In the preparation of these tables, 
the height, weight, age and sex of the individual have 
been considered, and by means of many comparisons 
they have obtained results similar to the following : 

In the following table are given the estimated 
heights, weights and food requirement of an average 
man at different ages, the figures for height and weight 
being based upon the data given by Hill for males of 
the Teutonic races. (Recent advances in Physiology 
and Biochemistry) :

Even with these tables we must know that every in- 
dividual of given weight, height and age cannot be 
given the same amount or the same kind of food. 
There are other important factors which influence body 



3^ FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

needs. By far the most important of these is the ac- 
tivity of the individual, denoted by work and rest. 
The kind of work and the conditions under which the 
person works are of vast importance. A person may 
do light work, moderate work or work which demands 
severe muscular exertion. The amount of tissue de- 
stroyed in each case will vary greatly, so that one can 
readily see that the amount of food needed to replace 
the body waste must vary greatly. 

Standard dietaries to meet these conditions have 
also been prepared by different scientists. One method 
by which results have been obtained has been the selec- 
tion of different individuals, living under different con- 
ditions. All the food which these people have eaten 
has been analyzed and all the excreta from the body. 
In this way comparisons have been made between the 
weights of the individual at different times in order 
to determine whether the food taken into the body was 
equal to the daily waste of the body substance. 

Some of the standard daily dietaries suitable for a 
man of average weight and build doing moderate 
amount of muscular work are as follows : 

Carbo- 
Authority. Protein. Fat. hydrate. Calories. 

Voit ii8-gms. 56 gms. 500 3055

A woman requires .8 the food required by a man at moderate 

work. 



FOOD AND ITS USES. 33 

A boy 15-16 requires .9 of the amount of food of a man at moder- 
ate work. 

A girl 15-16 requires .8 of the amount of food of a man at moder- 
ate work. 

A boy of 12 requires .7 of the amount of food of a man at moder- 
ate work. 

A girl 10-12 requires .6 of the amount of food of a man at moder- 
ate work. 

A child 6-9 requires .5 of the amount qi food of a man aj: moder- 
ate work. 

A child 2-5 requires .4 of the amount of food of a man at moder- 
ate work. 

Mental work is also an important factor influencing 
the amount and the nature of the food required by an 
individual. , As the person doing mental work does 
little or no muscular labor, body waste is not so great ; 
therefore less food is needed to make good natural 
losses. For example, a clerk doing desk work may be 
well nourished on a diet yielding 2500 calories, while 
a blacksmith at hard labor would require 4500-5000 
calories to keep himself in good condition. 

Other factors which influence the food requirement 
are age and sex, climate and season, weight and build 
and personal idiosyncrasies or peculiarities. In all 
animal life the young demands food for growth as well 
as for repair, so we know that, relative to its weight, 
a child requires more food than an adult. Women re- 
quire less food than men, because as a rule they are 
smaller and their bodies contain more fat and less mus- 
cle than those of men relative to their weight, so we 
say that women need about .8 as much food as men 
under similar conditions.

34 FOOD FOR THF SICK. 

In cold climates more fuel food is needed to keep 
body temperature normal. As the external tempera- 
ture decreases more food must be consumed, and it is 
better to increase the protein as it gives a greater 
amount of heat than other food nutrients. Seasons 
affect the food requirements more as to the kind than 
as to quantity of food which one needs. A diet rich in 
vegetable matters and relatively poor in proteins is bet- 
ter-in summer. 

The build and shape of the body is of more import- 
ance when computing its food requirements than the 
weight. The greater the surface of the body, the more 
heat is lost by radiation and more food is required to 
maintain body temperature. Thus a tall, thin man of 
a given weight may require more food than a short, 
fat man of the same weight living under the same con- 
ditions. 

Personal peculiarity plays a very important role in 
"the diet requirement of different individuals living 
under identically the same external conditions. The 
nervous system of each regulates the utilization of 
food materials, and body waste varies accordingly. 
This teaches us that we cannot nuake or take any stand- 
ard dietary and attempt to apply it to all individuals 
living under similar conditions. Every man is a sep- 
arate entity, in health and in disease, and this fact must 
always be borne in mind: However, this does not 
mean that we cannot make and use, with discretion, 
standard dietaries for people living under varying con- 
ditions. From these tables we can obtain valuable in- 



FOOD AND ITS USES. 35 

formation which will enable us properly to balance our 
diet. Quite as much harm can be done and is done^ by 
an improperly balanced diet as by a diet which is in- 
sufficient in food value. A diet too rich in fats may 
be conducive to certain diseased conditions of the 
body. A diet too low in food value may, undermine 
the general health and thus be a predisposing factor 
for the development of certain diseases. Ignorance 
more than poverty is to blame for both of these 
conditions. A campaign to scatter easily available 
knowledge is needed to correct the evil. The poorer 
classes need to be taught food values and to b,e shown 
that just as good and nourishing a diet may be ob- 
tained from food relatively low in cost as from food 
representing a considerable outlay of money. The 
proper preparation and cooking of good nutritious 
foods cannot be overestimated, as many people in their 
ignorance throw out of the back door more than the 
wage earner can bring in at the front door. 

Here it is interesting to show some diets actually 
consumed by individuals of different countries and of 
different social ranks. These are selected from some 
of Atwater's tables, and most of them approach stand- 
ards very closely:

In planning the menu for a meal we do not limit 
our selection to one, two or three foods. We like va- 
riety for several reasons, to balance the diet, to tempt 
the appetite, and to aid digestion. For instance, we 
precede a heavy meal with a light soup, not for the 
dietetic value of the soup, for that is low ; but to stimu- 
late the appetite and flow of digestive juices. A pickle, 
relish or salad may be used as an appetizer, not because 
it is high in nutritive value, although the value of each 
depends upon its nature. Monotony of diet will de- 
prive many people of appetite and will thus leave them 
in a poorly nourished condition in which they will be 
more susceptible to disease. Therefore it is a good 
thing to add to the daily dietary many harmless foods 
relatively low in food value because of the psychic as 
well as dietetic value which they possess.

Proper dieting for the sick depends a great deal on 
the ability of either the patient or some member of 
his family to use diet tables ; but when the principle of 
their use is once grasped, their application to the sick 
person is mainly a matter of common sense and arith- 
metic. Vague though our conceptions of the exact 
nature of the fundamental food groups may be, if we 
know what is wanted and why, it should be a simple 
matter to consult the table and plan a diet accordingly. 
If the physician wishes a typhoid fever patient to have 
a diet of high caloric value containing, say, 250 grams 
carbohydrate, 100 grams protein, and 200 grams fat, 
and also wants easily digested foods, he can work out 
from the tables a diet such as

The division of any diet into meals will be dependent 
to a great extent on the nature of the disease and the 
caprices of the patient's appetite ; but it is usually bet- 
ter to plan a day in detail, so that a routine can be 
established which will not be interfered with; and one 
can be reasonably sure that the whole amount figured 
on will be taken. 

The obtaining of variety in menus is perhaps more 
important in disease than in health, since more rigid 
limits as to foods are placed on the sick person. In 
the following chapters dealing with various diseases 
the question of variety in foods will be discussed, both 
from the standpoint of the scientific requirements of 
the disease and from the standpoint of preparation. 



CHAPTER III. 
DIABETES MELLITUS 

Diabetes is a disease characterized by the appear- 
ance of sugar in the urine. Normally sugar is not 
found in urine by the common tests and its presence 
generally but not always means diabetes. The condi- 
tion of sugar in the urine is called "glycosuria" : this 
is not always diabetes. Nowadays the diagnosis of 
true diabetes can easily be made, and no one having 
sugar in his urine can afford to go without consulting 
a physician. The sugar appears in the urine of a dia- 
betic because he is unable to use the carbohydrate of 
his diet, and part or all of it passes through the blood 
to the kidneys where it is excreted as sugar. As al- 
ready stated in the second chapter, the carbohydrates 
of ordinary food are found in sugars, in the so-called 
starchy foods such as bread, potatoes, cereals, in 
fruits and some vegetables ; and as the sugar in the 
urine comes from these substances the logical way of 
treating diabetes would seem to be merely the exclu- 
sion from the diet of all such carbohydrate foods. But 
unfortunately the disease is not so simple as this even 
in its mildest stage, and one cannot remove all carbo- 
hydrate from the diet of a normal person without 
danger. If we^take starchy foods away from a normal 
person a substance appears in the urine known as ace- 
tone which indicates that the body is being poisoned. 
Now this poison comes from the fats in the food and will 

(41) 



42 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

usually be found if a healthy person eats no carbohy- 
drate food for even as short a time as 24 to 48 hours ; 
and it appears because there is no carbohydrate to be 
burned. The normal person who is not eating enough 
carbohydrate soon shows acetone, and the diabetic who 
is not using the carbohydrate he receives is in exactly 
the same position. Although the carbohydrate gets 
into the stomach, something is lacking in the body to 
make it of use, and it passes through the body. Any 
one who knows anything about an automobile engine 
will see a ready comparison in "carbureter troubles." 
A plentiful supply of gasoline is fed to the machine, 
but because the carbureter is not correctly performing 
its task of getting the "gas" ready for the motor the 
machine balks and finally stops. So with the diabetic. 
When the obscure cause of the disease starts the body 
on its path of not using carbohydrate, the disease if 
untreated generally progresses and less carbohydrate is 
being used all the time. So that no matter how much 
starchy food a diabetic may eat he uses only a small 
portion of what he eats, and he is therefore in approxi- 
mately the same condition as the riormal person who is 
getting no carbohydrate. If this keeps up long enough 
the diabetes becomes severe and acetone may appear in 
the urine in the course of the disease. If all starchy 
foods are taken away from the diabetic, as was formerly 
done, it is true that the sugar may disappear, but at the 
same time acetone may appear in the urine, and the 
patient may show signs and symptoms of poisoning 
which are more dangerous than the presence of su^ar. 



DIABETES MEEUTUS, 43 

That is the reason why the treatment of diabetes is not 
the simple matter of withdrawing carbohydrates. 

It has been said so far that diabetes is a disease char- 
acterized by sugar in the urine, but that other danger- 
ous substances (acetone bodies) may also be found 
The sugar comes from the carbohydrates of the food, • 
and the acetone from the fats of the food; so that it 
can be seen that in diabetes two of the most import- 
ant food elements are or may be involved. But that 
is not all. The third important food division is pro- 
tein, and in quite a few cases of diabetes the sugar in 
the urine is made from the protein in the food or in 
the body tissues as well as from carbohydrate. It re- 
quires considerable skill and much careful analysis of 
both food and urine to determine in an individual case 
just how the food is behaving and just what abnormal 
constituents of the urine come from what source of 
food, but nowadays that is done as part of the treat- 
ment of every case, and it must be done if the patient 
is going to be able to assist the physician in taking care 
of himself. Usually better results are obtained if the 
patient is in an institution where the urine can be ex- 
amined every day, and where the patient can be care- 
fully controlled in every particular, which means diet, 
rest and exercise, drink, etc. ; and whenever this is pos- 
sible it will be found that a stay of from one to three 
weeks will be a tremendous saving all around. Also 
we want to enable the patient who may have oppor- 
tunity to take hospital treatment for a time, upon leav- 
ing the institution, to assist his physician in taking

care of him. But with some patients this is not pos- 
sible, in which case the physician has to do the best he 
can, and with inteUigent co-operation by the patient 
he can often achieve wonderfully good results. 

In treating diabetes it must be understood at the 
• outset that the aim of treatment is to get the urine 
free from sugar and free from acetone. The means 
of doing this vary with the individual case and with 
the severity of the disease. In the course of history 
many so-called diabetic "cures" have been described, 
but it can safely be said that a specific diabetic cure 
has never been found. 'It is true that patients can be 
made free from sugar and acetone and then can eat 
a considerable amount of all kinds of food, but even 
these patients if they are real diabetics can not trans- 
gress certain limits which have been found for them. 
That is one of the strongest arguments for the mod- 
ern practice of telling a patient as much about his dis- 
ease as he can understand, and that is why we are go- 
ing into such details in this chapter. 

As we have already stated, the aim of treatment is 
to get the urine free from sugar and acetone. If 
acetone is not present we must aim to prevent its ap- 
pearance during treatment. In the mildest cases of 
diabete? the sugar will disappear from the urine if we 
simply remove some of the carbohydrates from the 
diet, whereas in other cases it may be necessary to 
starve a patient completely. The best way to find out 
just what kind of a "case" we are dealing with is to 
put the patient on a special diet in which every article 



DIABETES MEtLlTUS. 45 

oi food is known, and either weighed accurately or 
estimated approximately. Such a diet may be seen 
below :

This diet contains approximately 70 gms. protein, 
100 gms. fat and 70 gms. carbohydrate, and the pa- 
tient is kept on it for at least two days. Then the 
carbohydrate is cut down by taking away 25 gms. of 
bread every day. If the case is a mild one, the sugar 
will disappear and no acetone will appear, and then 
the first step of treatment will have been accomplished. 
The next step is to keep the urine clear for some days, 



46 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

and then carbohydrate is added gradually in order to 
see how much the patient will use without sugar re- 
appearing. This is best done by again adding one 
ounce of bread a day until the patient is taking 4 or 
5 ounces. It is wise not to attempt to use more than 
one kind of starchy food at a time at this stage of 
treatment, but if the patient prefers potato or some 
cereal like oatmeal we can use either potato or oat- 
meal instead of bread. When we do we must remem- 
ber that 3 ounces of potato, or 9 ounces of cooked oat- 
meal contain the same amount of carbohydrate as i 
ounce of bread, so that we can safely use 3 times as 
much potato or 9 times as much cooked oatmeal. If 
on the other hand the patient would like to eat more 
than one kind of carbohydrate food, we must find out 
whether he can do this without the appearance of sugar, 
as some patients can not "mix" their carbohydrate 
food. The best way of doing this is to substitute for 
the bread already in the diet equivalent amounts of 
potato or oatmeal. For instance, on the first day we 
can give 9 otmces of cooked oatmeal in place of one 
ounce of the bread, and the next day we can give 3 
ounces of potato instead of one ounce of bread. This 
method of testing equivalent foods is illustrated in 
some sample diets :

Of course the changes which can be run into such 
a diet are many. One must know just how much car- 
bohydrate the patient is receiving, and if it is desired 
to substitute some other foods all that is necessary is 
to consult the food tables. For this purpose the ar- 
rangement of foods into groups on the basis of the 
amount of carbohydrate they contain is very convenient 
and the table which Dr. Joslin has used is most con- 
venient.

50 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

In this little table the more common foods are all put 
down under the percentage of carbohydrate they con- 
tain ; and it requires very simple arithmetic to learn to 
■ use it. For example any one of the 5% group can 
be substituted for the same amount of any other food 
in the group; only }4 the amount of any of the 10% 
group, and only 1/3 the amOunt of any in the 15^" 
group, however, can be substituted for articles in the 
5% group. On the other hand if the patient wants 
to eat apples instead of bread all he has to know is 
that apples contain 15% carbohydrate, while bread 
contains 60%, so that it will take 4 times as much 
apple as bread to yield the equivalent amount of carbo- 
hydrate in the food. He can then substitute for one 
ounce of bread 4 ounces of apple, which is the average 
weight of one ordinary sized apple. Such substitu- 
tions can be carried out in an almost indefinite manner, 
so that after the exact amount of carbohydrate which 
a patient can use is once determined menus of sur- 
prising variety can be served. 

Some examples of menus showing such possible sub- 
stitutions and the methods of making them are now 
shown, and at the end of the chapter will be found 
numerous more menus. The carbohydrate content of 
the food for all three days is approximately 54 grams.

Unfortunately most cases of diabetes, unless they 
come for treatment very early in the disease, do not 
clear up as easily as the mild ones just described, and 
in such cases the procedure employed to make the urine 
free from sugar is different. Most of such patients 
already show acetone and diacetic acid in the urine, in 
which case a real danger may exist from further re- 
ducing the cabohydrate of the food. All sorts of 
methods for treating such patients have been described, 
but need not be discussed in this book because it has 
been shown that the very best thing to do for such pa- 
tients is to take all food away. It may sound strange 
to say that withdrawing the carbohydrates and leaving 
the other foods may be dangerous, whereas withdrawal 
of all food will give good results, but the experience 
of many years shows this to be true. 

But this starvation treatment can not be considered , 
a simple procedure, and it must be carried out with the 
greatest care and always under the control of a physi- 
cian. The patient is confined to bed during the star- 



diabe;te;s melmtus. 53 

vation days, and the physician makes daily examina- 
tions of the urine. In our opinion it is inadvisable 
suddenly to put a patient on starvation, and' the physi- 
cian must determine in the individual case just when to 
take away all food. If the patient is put on the test 
diet already described on page 45 it may be found 
that he is not only showing sugar but a large amount 
of acetone bodies in the urine. In such a case it is prob- 
ably best to remove most of the fats before anything 
else is done. Then follow one or two days in which 
nothing but 3 or 4 eggs, .250 to 300 gms. (8-10 oz.) of 
5% vegetables are given, and as a rule starvation can 
follow safely. During the starvation nothing is given 
by mouth except water as much as wanted, coffee or 
tea without sugar or cream (6 ounces 3 times during 
the day), and in some cases 8-10 ounces of clear 
chicken or meat broth and whiskey J^ ounce every 
3 hours. Starvation is kept up until the urine is free 
from sugar.; some physicians have starved patients as 
long as 10 days. With the method we have just out- 
lined 1-3 days' starvation is usually successful. 

Before discussing the treatment which follows we 
want to show actual diets used in reaching the starva- 
tion Idvel. The two days test already described on 
page 45 were followed by the following diets :

Starvation until sugar-free urine is obtained. 

If by this method we have succeeded in. making the 
urine free from sugar and acetone, we have accom- 
pHshed the same thing as we did with the milder cases 
by a simple withdrawal of carbohydrate. The patient 
is in relatively the same condition as the mild case, 
and is now ready to have food. When we give to 
this class of patients we must remember what was 
said earlier in this chapter about the possible dangers 
from protein and fat as well as from carbohydrate, so 
that we must add food very slowly and know exactly 
what we are giving. The principle to have in mind 
now is the gradual addition every day of compara- 



DIABETES MEI<WTUS. 55 

tively small amounts of food whose value in protein, 
fat arid carbohydrate is known. The 5% vegetables, 
forming as they do a large bulk with small nourish- 
ment, are the first carbohydrate to be added, while the 
protein and fat are found in eggs. The JoUowing 
schedules of Joslin, with their explanatory notes, will 
give a good idea of how this part of the treatment is 
carried out. 

Fasting:. Fast until sugar-free. Drink water freely and tea, 
coffee and clear meat broth as desired. In very severe, long stand-' 
ing and complicated cases, without otherwise changing hiabtts or 
diet, omit fat, after two days omit protein and halve carbohydrate 
daily to 10. grams, then fast. 

Carboliydrate Tolerance. When the 24 hour urine is 
sugar-free, add 160 grams of 6 per cent, vegetables, and continue to 
add 5 grams carbohydrates daily ap to 20, and then 6 grams every 
other day, passing successively upward through the 5, 10, and 
15 per cent, vegetables, 6 and 10 per cent, fruits, potato and 
oatmeal to bread, unless sugar appears or the tolerance reaches 
3 grams carbohydrate per kilogram body weight. 

Protein Tolerance. When the urine has been sugar-free 
for 2 days, add 20 grams protein (3 eggs) arid thereafter 16 grams 
protein dailjr in the form of meat until the patient Is receiving 

1 gram protein per kilogram body weight, or if the carbohydrate 
tolerance is zero, only |^ gram per kilogram body weight. 

Fat Tolerance. While testing the protein tolerance, a 
small quantity of fat is included in the eggs and meat given. Add 
no mol'e fat until the protein reaches 1 gram per kilogram (unless 
the protein tolerance is below this figure) but then add 26 {[rams 
daily until the patient ceases to lose weight or receives not over 
40 calories per kilogram body weight- 
Reappearance of Sugar. The return of sugar demands 
fasting for 24 hours or until sugar-free. The diet is then increased 
twice as rapidly as before, but the carbohydrate should not exceed 
half the former tolerance until the urine has been sugar-free for 

2 weeks, and it should not then be increased more than 5 grams 
per week. 

Weekly Faot Days. Whenever the tolerance is less than 
20 grams carbohydrate, fasting should be practised one day in 
seven; when the tolerance is between 20 and 60 grams carbo- 
hydrate, upon the .weekly fast day 5 per cent vegetables and one- 
half the usual quantiw of protein and fat are allowed; when the 
tolerance is between «) and 100 grams carbohydrate, the 10 and 15 
per cent vegetables are added as well. If the tolerance is more 
than 100 grams carbohydrate, upon weekly fast days the carbo- 
hydrate should be halved. 



S6 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

If these additions are made slowly enough, in many 
cases considerable carbohydrate as well as protein and 
fat may be added, but it is well to remember that 
modern science has shown that it is most unwise to 
attempt to "stuff" a patient as was formerly done with 
prptein or fat or both. The patient does not have to 
gain back his weight : it has been found that if he can 
comfortably live and perform his nomial activities on 
less food than he is accustomed to his diabetes will be 
improved. 

If the patient has understood what has Ijeen done 
for him up to this point he will easily be able to go 
home and continue the "cure." The amount of each 
kind of food which is best for him having already 
been established, he can by a little study control his 
own diet. He should learn to test Jiis own urine for 
sugar (the test is given at the end of this chapter) 
and should know what to do if sugar appears. We 
believe that the very best results in treatment can be 
attained if the patient lives on a scheduled diet. If 
Sunday is his accustomed heavy feeding day, he should 
begin his week on Monday with a partial fast day. 
This would include eggs, bacon, 5% and 10% vege- 
tables; the next day he takes his usual diet with only 
one half his limit of carbohydrate food; for instance, if 
he has been eating 4 ounces of bread or its equivalent in 
oatmeal or potato, he should on Tuesday eat only 2 
ounces. On Wednesday he takes ^ and for the 
rest of the week he can have his full quota of carbo- 
hydrate.

During all this time he ought to lead a regular life 
in which exercise plays an important role. Every dia- 
betic patient, be it man,_ woman or child, will get along 
better after the treatment we have outlined if exercise, 
especially in the open air, becomes a regular part of the 
•routine of living. If the diabetic is accustomed to al- 
cholic drinks a glass of Rhine or Moselle wine, or a 
high-ball with dinner may help his digestion, but beer, 
champagne and all sweet wines are strictly forbidden. 

The condition of the diabetic may change from time 
to time, so that during the home treatment sugar may 
appear in the urine without a definite reason. When- 
ever sugar appears it is a signal to cut down the carbo- 
hydrates, and the best way to do this is by a fast day 
which usually will cause the sugar to disappear. Then 
if the gradual addition of cabohydrates be practised 
as we have just advised, it is easy to find out how much 
carbohydrate may be safely added to the diet before 
sugar appears. Then, of course, no more than this 
amount should be taken. On the other hand, many 



6o FOOD FOR THF SICK. 

patients find that after some time they can eat more 

carbohydrate than their allowance, which means that 

the treatment has improved the condition ; and in such 

cases it is usually safe to allow the extra amount. But 
even with the improved patients we believe that the 

gradual schedule of food should be followed and that 
the chances for a continuation of improvement are 
greater if such a schedule is used.

CHAPTER IV. 
GOUT 

Gout is a definite disease, with definite symptoms, 
characteristic blood and urinary findings and a fairly 
well defined course. Gout is an inflammation of the 
joints, associated with ox caused by a retention of uric 
acid in the blood, and, except in the beginning of an 
acute attack, lessened excretion in the urine. As a 
rule in true gout there is a deposit of the sodium salt 
or uric acid somewhere in the body — the lobe of an 
ear, the joint itself, over the elbow, in front of the 
knee — a chalky white deposit with a characteristic ap- 
pearance uiider the microscope. 

These words picture true gout, which, although 
comparatively rare in this country, may be seen when 
looked for. Many other conditions have unfortu- 
nately been associated with gout — under the name 
"goutiness," "uric acid diathesis," etc., but at the 
present time such a grouping is unwise and mislead- 
ing. The urine of many persons will on standing pre- 
cipitate a large amount of uric acid or its salts^ but 
this is not gout and in no way related to it. "An ex- 
cess of uric acid" often reported in urine analyses 
usually means a physical-chemical change in the 
urine, and is quite different from the small amount 
usually excreted in gout. 

The uric acid which is retained in the blood stream 
in gout is derived from two sources: i, protein food 

' (97) 



98 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

rich in nuclei — the nucleo-proteins [exogenous uric 
acid] ; 2, destruction of cells in the body [endogenous 
uric acid] . These nucleo-proteins, whether they origi- 
nate from the food or from the constant cell destruc- 
tion occurring during normal life, are called the 
"purin bodies." The difference between a normal 
and a gouty person is this : purin bodies are taken 
with food by both, and also 'arise from normal body 
activity in both, but a normal person excretes his ex- 
cess, whereas the gouty person can not excrete his 
and it remains in the blood. 

The treatment of gout can be considered under two 
main headings : ( i ) , prevent the formation of uric 
acid; (2), facilitate its elimination. Since uric acid 
arises from two sources the exogenous (food) and en- 
dogenous (cell destruction), and since it is obviously 
more difficult to control cell activity than the food in- 
take, the necessity of careful dietary regulation is at 
once apparent. The traditional association of gout 
with high livers and drinkers is of course based on 
facts. Excessive eating really means a potential in- 
crease in the uric acid precursors from cell destruc- 
tion as well as an actual increase from external sources ; 
for it has been shown that excessive work put upon 
the digestive glands causes ^n increased formation of 
endogenous uric acid. 

The food of a gouty patient must be regulated from 
every direction — quantity, quality and habits of eat- 
ing. Not only must the purin metabolism be con- 
sidered, but in many instances careful attention must 



GOUT. 99 

be paid to the carbohydrates, for gouty individuals 
often show glycosuria; to the kidneys which not in- 
frequently are affected; and to the weight of the pa- 
tient, for obesity should be avoided. The best results 
in treating a gouty patient would be obtained in an 
'institution where the patient can be "tested out" just 
as a diabetic is tested, and where a tolerance limit for 
purins can be established. 

/ 
During an acute attack of gout a "purin-free diet," 

such as Chace recommends, can be given. 

Breakfast: Apple or banana, cream of wheat or fa- 
rina with cream and sugar, one egg, cup of cereal cof- 
fee with cream and sugar, toast and butter. 

Dinner: One tgg, baked potato with butter, string 
beans, rice or macaroni, baked apple with sugar, a glass 
of milk. 

Supper: Rice with butter, cream cheese, bread and 
butter, stewed pears, rice pudding. 

The diet for chronic gout must be well balanced 
and should maintain the patient's strength. For a man 
weighing 150 lbs. Chace recommends 70 gms. of pro- 
tein (mainly vegetable), 200 gms. carbohydrate, 150 
gms. fat (2500 calories). The purin content of 
the various foods should be understood and the fol- 
lowing table from Walker Hall gives the purin con- 
tent of some commoner foods.

There is no essential difference in the purin con- 
tent of the different meats, chicken or fish ; certain of 
the vegetables are purin free, others contain varying 
amounts. Of drinks tea, coffee and cocoa are especially 
rich in purins. Whiskey drinkers are not prone to 
gout, but beer drinkers are, and although the percen- 
tage of purin in beer seems small, a heavy beer drinker 
will consume large amounts in a day. Certain other 
points should be remembered. Meats which are boiled 
contain less uric acid precursors than roast meats. Al- 
cohol, even in the purin-free beverages, should be used 
only as a necessary stimulant. All condiments, certain 
fruits, as strawberries, oranges, cucumbers, should not 
be used. 

Salt should be used sparingly as it tends to cause a 
deposit of sodium urates. Water, especially the saline 
mineral types, has a special use in assisting elimination, 
but alkalies and alkali waters may cause the deposit of 
urates and should be avoided. 



I02 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

The essential element in the treatment of gout is in- 
dividuahzation of the patient. The remote causes are 
as important as the uric acid metabolism. Poor habits 
of living should be corrected, a sedentary life ought to 
be replaced by mild exercise or massage. Excesses of 
alcohol or of eating must be replaced by moderation. 
Certain occupations, such as working with lead, seem 
to predispose to gout, and it would be folly to diet a 
lead worker and allow him to continue his dangerous 
trade.

CHAPTER V. 

DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY 
ACUTE NEPHRITIS 

In acute nephritis the kidney tissue is damaged by 
inflammation from bacterial or other poison so that it 
is ijnable to perform its usual functions. The symp- 
toms arising in acute nephritis are in part due to the 
damming back into the body of those products of the 
body chemistry (metabolism) ~ which normally are 
passed by the kidney from the blood into the ureters. 
Since little or no urine is passed in this condition, 
such products of metabolism enter -the general circula- 
tion, and the symptoms of uraemia or of edema de- 
velop as a result. Whether, as has been generally ac- 
cepted, the uremic symptoms are due to the reten- 
tion of products of nitrogen metabolism and edema 
to retention, of salts or water, or both ; or whether 
Fischer's theory, that the symptoms are referable to 
the acidifying of the kidneys and the tissues, be cor- 
rect cannot be discussed in these pages, although the 
practical application of both conceptions, as applied to 
the dietetic management of the disease, will be thor- 
oughly considered. 

Using as a basis of treatment the same rational 
procedure which would be applied to the treatment of 
an infected finger, we should first of all as nearly as 
possible allow the kidneys an opportunity to attain 

(105) 



I06 FOOD FOR THF SICK. 

functional rest. The accomplishment of this aim 
would be easy enough were it not for the fact that 
kidney rest is incompatible with normal body function : 
the kidneys must get rid of the toxic metabolic pro- 
ducts constantly being formed in ordinary body econ- 
omy. Some of these substances seem to have a harm- 
ful effect on the damaged kidney itself. Therefore, 
since complete functional rest is impossible and since 
certain products of metabolism are more harmful than 
others, we have to select a path to which the kidneys 
offer least resistance; in other words, we have to try 
to bring to the kidney substances which in their pas- 
sage are the least harmful to it. 

While there are ho means of actually testing which 
substances harm the kidney, there is much evidence to 
prove retention of certain substances. The presence 
of edema shows water retention, which, however, may 
not necessarily be primary ; the small amount of sodium 
chloride excreted in the urine proves that sodium chlo- 
ride is retained; and the quantitative determination of 
non-protein nitrogen or of urea in the blood indicates 
that nitrogenous end products do not pass through the 
kidneys in a normal manner. Water, salt and nitro- 
gen are all food elements, so that the role food plays 
in the management of such a case seems apparent ; and 
the effort- to secure a suitable diet in nephritis, either 
acute or chronic, is one of the most important, if not 
the most important element in its therapeutics. Food 
must be selected so that the end products of its metab- 
olism are as far as possible "bland" substances with 



DISEASES OE THE KIDNEY. lO/ 

regard to the kidney tissue ; and especial attention must 
be paid to the nitrogen, salt and water content. The 
reason milk has formed the basis of most "cures" of 
acute nephritis is that (~i) milk contains a small salt 
content; (2) the protein element in milk is not only 
small, but it is of such a nature that the end-products 
of its metabolism are comparatively non-toxic; (3) 
the water content is exactly known, and (4) it is 
easily digested. One great trouble with milk as an 
ideal food is that too large amounts are needed to sup- 
ply enough calories for the nourishment of the body 
without flooding the body with an excess of water. 

In the most acute stage of nephritis perhaps the best 
way to attain functional renal rest is to give nothing 
to eat and to allow only water in limited amounts to 
enter the body. Plain or carbonated water by mouth, 
ice pellets, or even water per rectum are allowed; but 
how much each patient should receive must be deter- 
mined for the individual patient by carefully balanc- 
ing the amount of urine voided and the extent of 
edema against the symptoms of uraemia. If the kid- 
neys are secreting any urine at all, somewhat more 
water should be allowed in the 24 hours than is void- 
ed, because water itself is a gOod diuretic and prob- 
ably helps "flush" retained poisons through the kidney. 
The intense thirst of this period may be allayed by the 
addition of cream of tartar and lemon juice to the 
water, which makes a pleasant slightly diuretic drink.* 

* To cnfe pint boiling waV-r add 1 dram of cream of tartar, the juice of 
% lemon and a little sugar. 



I08 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

How long to maintain a patient merely on water will 
naturally depend almost entirely on his reaction to 
treatment. If he is going to react at all, two or three 
days at most should suffice, and then milk can be 
added. 600-900 cc. (20 to 30 oz.) of milk will fur- 
nish as much water as the body can well handle at this 
stage, and the additional nourishment can be supplied 
by other non-irritating bland foods, provided of course 
the patient is able to eat at all. Such substances as 
the cereals, poor in salts and protein, dry toast, 
potato, lactose, and, if digestion is not too impaired, 
saltless butter will add extra calories; and the citrous 
vegetables, well prepared seem to have a good efifect. 
Such a diet is the so-called salt-free "non-nitrogenous" 
and has a limited water content, and therefore it com- 
bines the principles of the most accepted "cures." 

Some specimen menus of such a diet as used by us 
with analyses are here shown:

This cure is usually begun by giving 3 to 6 oz- of 
milk three or four times a day. Gradually the amount 
given and the number of feedings is increased until 
the patient is getting about 2 qts. daily. The milk 
may be given plain but is usually diluted w^ith some 
alkaline mineral water, as lime water. In the summer 
the milk is given at room temperature, and in winter

it must be warmed. If the stools remain solid after 
one week of strict milk diet the amount given is in- 
creased to^ qts daily. If gastric disturbances and 
diarrhoea result, it is certain that the milk is being im- 
properly digested, and the amount should be tempora- 
rily decreased. If constipation result, this is a sign 
that the milk is agreeing and is being well utilized by 
the individual, and laxatives and enemeta may be used. 
This condition may also be overcome to some extent 
by diluting the morning portion of milk with small 
amounts of coffee and by adding baked apple or prunes 
to the afternoon's diet. If patient complains of thirst, 
feedings may be diluted with plain hot water, carbonat- 
ed water or lime: water. If the desire for food is too 
great to be withstood, herring or stale salt free bread 
in small amounts may be added, and milk soup thick- 
ened with cereal may be given once a week. This 
cure is usually given for five or six weeks and then a 
normal diet is gradually resumed, large quantities of 
milk still being taken. 

Martin Fischer has advanced an hypothesis of 
nephritis based on physical-chemical laws. According 
to his conception the symptoms of nephritis are due to 
an acidifying of the tissues of the body with a subse- 
quent osmosis of water. Edema is due not to salt or 
water retention by the kidneys, but to a disturbance 
of the general chemical reaction of the tissues which, 
becoming acid, take up water according to the laws of 
colloids ; uraemia is the result of the same condition in 
the brain. If this conception is correct, the treatment 



' DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. Ill 

outlined by us is incorrect, and Fischer does use a 
treatment based on his theory. Instead of limiting salt 
and water intake, he injects into the circulation or 
through the rectum a large quantity of his solution : 
Sodium carbonate (pure crystals) .... 14 

Sodium chloride 10 

Distilled water 1000 

The salts in this solution reaching the tissues change 
their chemical reaction, osmosis is reversed, water is 
withdrawn from the tissues, including the kidney, and 
free diuresis results. 

In clinical practice divergent results have been re- 
ported from the use of Fischer's solution. It is rather 
difHcult to reconcile such a radical departure from 
clinical practice — a' practice with at times brilliant re- 
sults, and we have been loath to employ it generally. 
In certain cases where anuria or a marked decrease in 
urinary secretion persisted, Fischer's solution given 
per rectum has seemed to have a beneficial result, but 
in other cases no particular advantage over the therapy 
already outlined could be noted. 

CHRONIC NEPHRITIS 

Since acute nephritis is very likely to develop into 
chronic nephritis or to occur as an exacerbation of 
chronic nephritis, it is logical to continue our dietary 
discussion of chronic nephritis along the lines already 
outlined. Assuming that the acute stage is gradually 
passing and that the patient is reaching a condition in 
which his kidneys have partially regained the power to 



112 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

functionate, our method of treating will be corres- 
pondingly changed to meet the increased functioning 
power of the kidney. As the symptonis of uremic 
poisoning or the edema subside, the additions to the diet 
must be based not on theory or on generalization, but 
entirely on the reaction of the individual patient. For 
example, Mr. P. recovered from an acute nephritis 
with a complete disappearance of uremic symptoms 
but with a persistent edema, and in his diet we care- 
fully avoided increasing salt or water, but allowed the 
gradual addition of carbohydrates, fats, and even a 
small amount of protein for days before the edema dis- 
appeared, when we carefully added salt and water to 
the diet. 

Another patient showing a different effect was Mr. 
X., in whom the acute stage subsided and all signs of 
edema and uremia disappeared. This man was kept 
on a low salt, low protein diet for a long time; his 
urine was clearing up but he did not feel up to stand- 
ard and remained anemic. Thinking that perhaps- 
some of his symptoms were due to the absence of pro- 
tein in the diet, we slowly added meat until his total 
protein intake was 60 grams. Almost immediately 
there was a marked general improvement in his con- 
dition without any signs of increased renal disturb- 
ance. This probably means that in this particular case 
the kidneys were not harmed by products of protein 
metabolism, but on the contrary they needed, as did 
the rest of the body, the elements of nutrition which 
protein alone can furnish. 



DISEASES OE THE KIDNEY. II 3 

Owing to the confusion which exists regarding the 
proper classification of the chronic nephritides we have 
so far avoided the use of the older pathological terms, 
which post mortem experience has shown are of no 
great service in the therapeutics of the disease. As a 
matter of fact, all modern studies have attempted to 
classify nephritis on the basis of function, and many 
schemes have been devised to discover in the individual 
patient Just what his kidneys can do. Although rnany 
of these functional tests have as yet not passed beyond 
the stage of acadernic interest, no discussion of diet in 
chronic nephritis would be complete without mention 
of the test diets of Hedinger and Schlayer and Mosen- 
thal. By application of a meal known to contain 
definite amounts of so-called diuretic substances and- 
careful urinalysis, it is hoped that the particular fun- 
tion of the kidney which is harmed will be demon- 
strated, so that logical dietetic procedures for the par- 
ticular case can be determined. The test, as modified 
by Mosenthal and as used by us in detail, is : 

the nephritic test diet. saltiness.

The urine is collected at two hour intervals during 
the day, and all of the night urine is saved separately. 
The amount and the specific gravity of each specimen 
is measured, the sodium chloride and nitrogen are de- 
termined on the grouped day specimens and on the 
night specimen. 

Unfortunately it is not always a simple matter to 
interpret the findings from such a test so that they 
can be made of value in prescribing a diet ; and from 
our standpoint it seems best at present to adopt some 
other standard. Although, as stated above, the divis- 
ion of cases of chronic nephritis on an anatomical 
basis of parenchymatous and interstitial nephritis is no 
longer warranted, from the standpoint of therapeutics 
we can well group the symptoms supposedly associated 
with the one type or the other and build our menus for 
the symptoms. Obviously a case of nephritis with 



DISEASES OE THE KIDNEY. II5 

marked edema and.no signs of uremic poisoning is 
treated differently from one with symptoms of intoxi- 
cation and no edema ; and the plan of diet would vary 
also. 

Now it is a clinical fact that we see most cases of 
chronic "parenchymatous nephritis" as a sequel to an 
acute attack, so that the diet for this type logically 
can be continued where we left off the discussion of 
acute nephritis. The diet then would have to be fixed 
almost entirely by the course of the disease. With a 
patient rapidly recovering from his symptoms we can 
rapidly increase his diet, bearing in mind always (i) 
the limitations of his renal function; (2) the neces- 
sity of supplying sufficient calories properly to nour- 
ish the body; (3) the prevention of undue strain at 
any particular time. The choice of foods for such a 
patient is large, and the table given later (page 128) 
can be consulted. Even though there be no consid- 
erable evidence of protein intoxication, it must be 
borne in mind that there is probably no p-wre type of 
renal disease, and that all those foods whose metab- 
olic end-produGts might damage the kidneys must 
be carefully considered. On this basis we would 
limit the protein to a minimum compatible with 
health and a feeling of well-being, and in no case 
of nephritis ought we allow more than 60-70 gms. 
protein. We have seen several patients whose gen- 
eral as well as renal condition showed definite im- 
provement after protein had been added to a diet main- 
tained too long on a very low nitrogen basis. 



Il6 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

This leads naturally to a discussion of the relative 
toxicity of different kinds of protein food. What may 
well be called a "traditional prejudice" against red- 
meats in favor of fish or chicken is certainly not found- 
ed on scientific or clinical experiments and is based on 
the conception that the "extractive" content of red- 
meats is poisonous. It is true that beef-extract, be- 
ing rich in purins, is harmful, but it is likewise true that 
thorough cooking of meat destroys the toxic proper- 
ties of its extractives. From any other standpoint the 
protein of meat is the same as the protein of fish or 
chicken, and we see no reason why a patient may not 
have a well-done steak if he prefers it to a chicken, 
and in the same amount he would have of chicken. 
This does not take into consideration the "relative di- 
gestibility" of meat as compared to fish or chicken, 
which is merely a general question of feeding to an in- 
valid and must not be confused with renal function. 
Naturally any sick man or woman should be given a 
tray of food which is tasteful and easy to digest, and 
as a .rule the convalescent from any illness can more 
easily tackle a soft fish or the meat of a chicken than he 
can a well-done piece of roast beef. As a matter of 
practical cookery most individuals do not care for well- 
done red meat unless the native taste of the meat is 
either not "ruined" by the fire or is supplanted by high 
seasoning certainly contra-indicated in nephritis. 

Ordinary stock soups are a very weak solution of 
beef extract flavored with salt and other seasonings, 
with a very high water content, relatively high content 



DISEASES OE The kidney. 117 

in substances toxic to the Icidney (extract, salt, season- 
ings) and an extremely small caloric value. Stock 
soups, therefore, outlaw themselves at once from the 
dietetic scheme of nephritis. A solution of toxic sub- 
stances in a medium itself not without danger is by no 
means an ideal food. So-called "cream soups," how- 
ever, call for an entirely different comment. Made 
with .milk, cream, flour or any combination of these 
three, flavored with vegetables allowed in the nephritis 
dietary, cream soups form a palatable, digestible and 
high caloric introduction to a meal. Vegetables, ex- 
cept legumes high in nitrogen seem to have a particu- 
lar field, possibly on account of their alkaline diuretic 
action. The legumes, being high in protein, must be 
considered under the class of proteins. All the carbo- 
hydrates and fat foods may be employed with safety 
as far as their toxicity to the kidney is concerned ; but 
since the digestion of these patients may be impaired, 
attention 'to palatability and digestibility will caution 
against excessive use of any food. 

The preparation and seasoning of food for the 
nephritic patient is just as important as the choice of 
foods to be used. It is very easy to deprive good foods 
of their dietetic value by improper preparation and by 
using condiments for seasoning which are harmful to 
the patient. Salt is the only condiment which should 
be used, and it should be used very sparingly. In some 
cases, when salt is poorly excreted, it is necessary to 
forbid its use entirely. In these cases the prepared 
"celery salt" or "onion salt" may be used when needed 



Il8 FOOD iPOR THi; SICK. 

for seasoning. Fried foods should never be used as 
food; the browned outer surfaces, saturated with 
grease, are harmful to both sick and well. Spices, 
strong acids, alcoholic beverages, tea and coffee should 
be avoided, as they are irritating to the kidneys. 

Bearing in mind not only the qualitative limitations 
of food in nephritis, but also the fact that excessive 
quantities of any food at a given time are likely to 
make too severe a strain on the renal reserve, the ne- 
phritic menu should of necessity consider both the kind 
of food and the time it is served. It is well to use 
the five-meal day, making the 3 main meals less "heavy" 
than normal and adding between-meal lunches. In 
this way the burden of elimination is spread through 
the day. Menus based on the principles we have just 
outlined and used with some of our nephritic patients 
are now shown.

CHRONIC "INTERSTITIAL" NEPHRITIS 

This is the name usually given to the condition gen- 
erally coming on insidiously with a somewhat vague 
group of symptoms, associated usually with high blood 
pressure, cardiac symptoms and with a urine charac- 
terized by its low specific gravity, a mere trace of al- 



122 FOOD FOR THE SIGK. 

bumen, a few casts and often increased excretion. Al- 
though as stated above "pure" types of nephritis are 
uncommon, edema is rarely found in this class of pa- 
tients. On the contrary, careful laboratory studies of 
blood and urine show in the circulating bood an in- 
crease of urea and other nitrogenous end products, 
whereas salt and water metabolism is not essentially 
disturbed. In these patients, then, the diet need not 
consider salt or water, but must embrace the protein 
and energy factors. This is particularly the kidney 
disease in which functional studies have shown an in- 
ability of the kidneys to pass a concentrated urine; the 
kidney has no reserve energy and therefore can not 
meet extra demands. The amount of solids excreted 
as represented by the specific gravity is fairly constant 
, day and night, and practically never reaches as high a 
percentage as . is found with normal kidneys. This 
probably is the reason for the increased excretion of 
water. ' 

This disease is almost invariably associated with 
high blood pressure, and later in its course with car- 
diac complications. The question as to whether high 
blood pressure may occur without such a disturbance of 
the kidney has not yet been definitely settled, so that 
high blood pressure as part of the disease chronic in- 
terstitial nephritis may be different from high blood 
pressure in other conditions. See page 143. 

The symptoms of this type of chronic Bright's 
disease may be obscure and elusive, and it is not al- 
ways the easiest disease to diagnose. The patient may 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. 123 

complain merely of slight headache, or of lassitude, or 
he may have stomach disturbances, or notice that he 
has to get up at night to urinate, or he may even not 
notice any symptoms until life insurance examination 
shows the trace of albumen and the casts, or perhaps 
the high blood pressure. He may not even know he 
is sick until some sudden strain results in an attack of 
apoplexy. 

Obviously then the treatment in this condition will 
depend on the stage at which the patient applies for 
medical treatment. If the diagnosis is made early, 
before any serious damage is done, the diet, like the 
rest of the treatment, must be aimed at preventing com- 
plications. The course usually followed is to order the 
patient to lower the tension at which he works, to 
work less and sleep more ; to eliminate from his day's 
routine things which are not necessary — in other words 
"to take things easy." As far as diet is concerned, it 
seems to us far more important to restrict the amount 
taken than to over emphasize the harmfulness of any 
particular articles of food. Heavy meals which mean 
work for all the organs of the body are contra-indicated, 
and the patient is ordered to leave the table before his 
appetite is completely satisfied. If he is hungry be- 
tween meals light luncheons of milk, or buttermilk and 
crackers or toast are allowed. 

Although we do not know the actual harmful effects 
of various foods in this condition we do have clinical 
and experimental evidence of the toxic action of some 
foods, as has already been explained in previous dis- 



124 FOOD FOR THi;. SICK. 

cussion. The avoidance of uraemic symptoms can per- 
haps be helped by restriction of nitrogenous foods, and 
the discussion of such foods in the eariier portion of 
this chapter apphes with equal force here. It is very 
doubtful, however, if complete restriction of animal 
protein is good practice when a disease is of long 
standing and the patient is likely to be engaged in 
normal pursuits which demand a rather liberal diet. 
Judgment must be exercised to balance the effect of 
articles of food, but excessive use of any food is always, 
contra-indicated. Likewise restriction of certain arti- 
cles of diet frequently Jound in a normal man's bill of 
fare, such as any kind of fried food, highly seasoned or 
rich food, pastries, should be insisted upon; these 
things are not necessary and may be harmful. 

As a basis we give menus for such a patient for 
seven days, which will show what restrictions are 
necessary, and how gfeat is the variety from which to 
pick a suitable diet.

If the disease has progressed so far as to -show signs 
of so-called~uraemic poisoning, the diet, hke the rest of 
the treatment, must be more rigid, and if frank uraemia 
is present the treatment will be different. Uraemic indi- 
cations call for vigilant attempts to rest the kidney and 
to eliminate accumulated poisons through channels 
other than the kidney. Rest in bed, purgation, sweats 
all have this object in view, and the diet must try to 
adhere to the principles laid down at the beginning of 
this chapter. The one exception — water — is founded 
on the physiological-chemical conception of uremias. 
One type, rather rare, is associated with general edema 
and is probably due to edema of the brain. When 
uraemic symptoms occur with generalized edema we 
know of no better dietary regime than the one already 
planned for the treatment of acute nephritis. The 
uraemia may, however, be due to one of two other 
causes : (a) retention of urinary products, (b) a toxin 
produced by the renal disease. In either one of these 
types — ^the commonest met with in practice — restriction 



128 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

of water is not only not indicated, but in the use of 
water we have one of the mildest and most- efficient 
diuretics known. If there be an accumulation in the 
body of some substances poisonous to the body, and 
if such substance can be "washed out" with water, we 
should certainly attempt to do so. In case of an ac- 
companying cardiac complication the use of water 
must be restricted merely because of the mechanical 
inability of the heart to pump it through the body. 

In resume then, when ureamic symptoms appear," the 
diet is changed accordingly. If these s)miptoms are 
mild, an increase in headache, greater lassitude, with- 
out any more marked manifestations, perhaps a com- 
plete removal of nitrogenous foods, with the customary 
purgation and sweating, will, accomplish the purposes. 
It is really not difficult for a patient to get a fairly 
liberal diet on this basis. The lists given on page 124, 
without meat, may be consulted. Water, as stated, 
should be used freely. 

If, on the other hand, more marked symptoms are 
noted, it is best to employ a strict milk and water diet, 
at least temporarily, and then gradually to add cereals, 
cream, sugar, bread, vegetables, as has been described 
under acute nephritis. In these cases the diet is merely 
an accessory in the general scheme to procure func- 
tional renal rest.

VEGETABLES. 

The vegetables which the nephritic should use are 
green vegetables, as lettuce and spinach, and the roots 
and tubers, as potatoes and beets. Legumes, peas and 
beans should be avoided. Green vegetables and tubers 
have a large percentage of water. The chief food prin- 
cipal found in these is starch. They are low in 
protein and fat. Mineral salts are found in these in 
varying amounts and this makes these vegetables very 
valuable foods. A good rule for cooking vegetables is, 
use enough water to cover strong vegetables, and small 
amount for sweet vegetables. Onions and cabbage 
would thus require a larger quantity of water for cook- 
ing than spinach or squash or beets. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

Pare potatoes and put in cold water to keep 
from discoloring. Put into pan or kettle and cover 
with boiling water. When nearly cooked, add 
pinch of salt or J^ tp. to every 3 potatoes. When 
tender, drain and mash. Add i teaspoon butter 
and I tsp. of hot milk or cream to every cup (8 
oz.) of mashed potato. Beat until light and 
creamy. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Scrub thoroughly one Irish or sweet potato. Cut 
off a small piece at each end to allow steam to es- 
cape. Bake in hot oven 45 to 60 minutes. When 
tender, either break potato open or prick with a 



138 FOOD FOR thb; sick. 

fork to allow steam to escape. Serve as soon as 
possible after baking. 

Creamed Potatoes. 

Prepare as for boiling or mashing. When ten- 
der drain and add White Sauce No. i and cook un- 
til potatoes nearly absorb this. 

Bscalloped Potatoes. 

Wash and pare potatoes. Into a baking dish 
put a layer of sliced potatoes. Sprinkle over this a 
little salt and flour and add a little butter. Pro- 
ceed in this manner until required amount is ob- 
tained. Then cover with sweet milk and bake in 
a hot oven 50 to 60 minutes. 

Asparagus. 

34 bunch asparagus makes an individual 
serving. Cut off lower end of stalk, wash and 
cook in boiling salted water until tender. Drain 
and serve with drawn butter sauce or with White 
Sauce No. 2, either plain or on toast. 

Spinach. 

Pick over spinach carefully, discarding heavy 
stems. Boil in salted water about 20 minutes. 
Drain and serve with butter sauce, or chop and 
serve with cream sauce. 

Stewed Celery. 

Scrape and wash celery. Cut into small pieces 
and cook until tender in boiling salted water. Serve 
with White Sauce No. 2. Celery is cooked in 
small amount of water and is not drained.

salted water in which a pinch of soda has been ad- 
ded. Drain and cover with boiling water and 
cook until very tender. Drain off water and add 
a little milk. Onions may be broiled by cooking 
by same method. After draining, cut in slices Y^. 
to J^ inch thick. Put into baking pan and put 
small piece of butter on each slice and broil under 
direct fire until nicely browned. 

Stewed Squash. 

Peel squash and cut into small pieces. Cook in 
boiling salted water until tender. Mash and ad,d 
butter and salt to season.

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE 

"Blood pressure" is now one of the bywords of the 
profession. Just as when appendicitis sprang into the 



144 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

limelight of easy diagnosis, almost everyone seemed 
to suffer from appendicitis; so to-day, thanks primar- 
ily to the zeal of life insurance examiners, "high blood 
pressure" is one of the commonest complaints of office 
practice. This concentration of attention on one symp- 
tom has been a tremendous factor for good — not un- 
mixed, however, with evil. Many patients have the 
impression that if they have high blood pressure they 
have a disease which will probably cause their death in 
short order, and it is certainly the minority who ever 
realize that hypertension is rarely more than a symp- 
tom indicating some underlying pathological disturb- 
ance. "Hardening of the arteries"-^-once a stylish 
name, occupies an insignificant niche now, not only in 
lay minds, but, too frequently, in the minds of physic- 
ians when high blood pressure is found. A low-grade 
chronic nephritis is most often overlooked, merely be- 
cause the single urine specimen examined does not 
show albumen and casts. Hypertension, as the result 
of a chronic infection in tonsils, in teeth, in prostate, 
has received much attention; but too often an unjus- 
tified tonsil enucleation or a wholesale extraction of 
teeth is executed without any attempt at proving the 
relation of cause and effect. We do not wish to be- 
little in any way the practice of removing a possible 
source of infection and toxic absorption, but we feel 
that the interesting study of hypertension as a sym- 
tom receives a serious shock from a practice too often 
executed without study of the individual patient. And 
it is the purpose of this introduction merely to em- 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. 145 

phasize that high blood pressure does not mean the 
same thing in every patient, and that properly to treat 
it requires careful analysis and a proper classification 
before treatment is begun. 

The dietary regime one should advise a patient to 
follow would naturally depend almost entirely on the 
fundamental cause of the trouble. Since by far the 
greatest number of patients with high pressure have 
at least an accompanying if not a causative chronic 
nephritis of the interstitial type, the diet used in chronic 
nephritis will be found most valuable. Just as this 
diet is modified to suit the variations of the disease 
with the individual nephritic patient, so it is modified 
to perhaps an even greater extent with the patient with 
high blood pressure, and few if any other symptoms. 
Diet has seemed to us of perhaps less value than the 
avoidance of strain, emotional as well as physical. 

Not infrequently tjhe worry associated with the knowl- 
edge of the possession of high blood pressure acts as a 
remarkable stimulant to mamtenance or increase of the 
pressure, and unless means to control such emotion are 
undertaken we believe dietary restrictions will be use- 
less, if not actually harmful, because of the tendency 
to center attention and increase the worry. It seems 
to us that it would be a better plan in many instances 
to allow a normal not excessive diet, rather than to 
adopt a strict regime when the latter would tend to 
upset the patient's equilibrium. (For details of diet 
see page 124.)

146 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

If the blood pressure is associated with arterial or 
cardiac disease, then of course treatment must aim at 
helping the heart. This will be discussed in the fol- 
lowing chapter. 

KIDNEY STONE 

Broadly speaking the chemical composition of the 
kidney stone will determine the nature of the diet to 
be employed. There are three general types of stone : 
those made up of (i) uric acid, (2) calcium oxalate, 
(3) phosphates. 

Much has been written about the relation of diet to 
these various stones, but in not all cases do the chem- 
ical indications point to successful dietary treatment. 
However, with some patients it may be possible to 
prevent the formation of new calculi by proper control 
of diet and living, and certainly the attempt should be 
made in all cases. 

Those patients whose calculi consist mainly of uric 
acid should be treated as we treat patients with gout. 
A well regulated life, a well balanced low caloric diet, 
plenty of water, and the prohibition of articles of food 
rich in uric acid precursors is advised (see page 100). 
One point in treatment dififering from the treatment 
in gout may be mentioned. The uric acid calculus 
may be precipitated by physical-chemical changes in 
the urine rather, than by a fundamental metabolic dis- 
turbance, the chemical change being shown by increas- 
ed urinary acidity. The use of alkalies or of alkali 
drinking water is therefore advised in cases of uric 
acid stone. 



DISEASES OF THE KIDNEY. I47 

So little is known of the cause of oxalate stones that 
it would not be of great avail to lay down explicit 
dietary rules. The removal from the diet of articles 
of food known to be rich in oxalates is advised from 
empiric reasons. Such foods are pepper, sorrel, rhu- 
barb, spinach, haricots, beet roots, dried figs, tea and 
cocoa. Food especially rich in calcium as milk, eggs 
and fresh vegetables (peas, beans, asparagus, radishes) 
should also be avoided. Meats, cereals, bread, rice, 
potatoes, apples, in moderation, may all be used to ad- 
vantage by the person who must avoid oxalates and 
calcium. Also since in many cases the oxalate stone 
is associated with uric acid, the advice just given for 
uric acid stones may well be followed. 

Phosphatic stones usually are found only when the 
urine presents two distinct abnormalities ( i ) alkalin- 
ity, (2) evidence of infection of the genito-urinary 
tract. The condition known as "phosphaturia", in 
which a person passes an alkaline urine heavily loaded 
with a precipitation of phosphates, is often associated 
with a disturbance of the nervous system, and is prob- 
ably not due to diet. For this reason the treatment of 
patients who have had phosphatic stones is directed 
toward improving the nervous condition producing 
the phosphaturia, keeping the kidneys well washed out, 
and the urine acid or amphoteric — its normal condi- 
tion. Whether diet can influence this is doubtful; it 
has been suggested (Neuberg) that the limitation of 
foods high in lime such as milk, eggs, fruit and sub- 
stitution of lime-poor foods such as meat, potato. 



148 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

cereals, has shown a good effect in some cases. The 
most important element in the diet and the only 
proved Helpful agent is water, which should be taken 
freely. As far as "trying-out" different theoretical 
diet cures is concerned it seems to us that a good game 
of golf or tennis or a few days' outing is more potent 
in eliminating "phosphaturia" than is food. If the 
phosphaturia disappears, the treatment of an accom- 
panying infection will do the rest. 



CHAPTER VI. 
DISEASES OF THE HEART 

There can be no special diet for all patients suffer- 
ing with heart disease, any more than there can be 
a general method of treatment of such' patients. A 
person with a disease of the heart without symptoms is 
quite different from the same patient after the disease 
has progressed to the stage where the heart muscle no 
longer performs its normal function — the stage of de- 
compensation. A person with a completely compen- 
sated heart can lead a normal life with the possible ex- 
ception of the restriction or prohibition of alcohol and 
tobacco. There must be no excesses in food as in 
other matters, but on the whole, as has already been 
stated in the discussion of hypertension, the less at- 
tention such a patient pays to his diet the better he 
will be. 

When, however, decompensation sets in there are 
some principles of diet to be observed : ( i ) spare the 
work of the heart; (2) avoid pressure on the heart 
by the stomach and intestines. Fluids usually should' 
be restricted, as the elimination of large amounts of 
fluids puts an extra burden on the heart. Fifteen hun- 
dred (1500) cc. best taken between meals forms the 
maximum limit for most cases. The severely ill pa- 
tients with edema generally will react to the same 
treatment already described for the "wet" cases of 
nephritis; in such cases the Karell cure (page 109) 
often causes a rapid disappearance of the edema. A 

(149) 



ISO FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

salt-poor diet has the same indications in heart disease 
as it has in kidney disease — edema ; and it can be used 
when we do not wish as low a diet as the Karell cure. 
Alcohol is advised in very small quantities, if at all. 

The actual food for moderately decompensated pa- 
tients should be easily digestible, and of a kind not 
likely to produce .gas in the stomach. Small meals at 
frequent intervals will relieve the burden of the heart 
and kidneys, and will not be so likely to produce pres- 
sure on the heart by distending the stomach. The com- 
pletely decompensated patient, bed-ridden and dys- 
pnoeic requires a very light diet. He will be incapable 
of the muscle work necessary to chew foods so that 
his diet _ must contain substances requiring only the 
effort of swallowing. Both because the stomach should 
not be filled and becavtse of the danger of overexertion 
the food should be given at frequent intervals and in 
small amounts.

DISEASES OF THE HEART. 151 

As convalescence is established the diet can grad- 
ually be increased until a full tray is reached. All 
meats and vegetables should be chopped or scraped at 
first, and the heavier foods should be given only when 
the heart is practically compensated. Kor the reasons 
already given, no heart patient who has ever shown the 
signs of decompensation should eat large itieals — the 
5 meal day should be his custom through life. Foods 
likely to ferment and produce gas in the stomach or 
intestines should be avoided. Mineral waters should 
be "still" rather than charged. It is always well for 
patients with heart disease — and this is especially true 
of those suffering from angina pectoris — to rest for 
one-half to one hour after meals. Often the strain of 
exercise, added to that of digestion and pressure from 
the full stomach, is just sufficient to bring on an at- 
tack of decompensation or of angina. Many patients 
with angina die suddenly just after eating — the symp- 
toms often being gastric, although the cause of death 
is the heart. 

We have already spoken of the diet in the arterio- 
sclerotic or the old myocarditic patient. (See page 
143.) On the whole it is difficult, to persuade these pa- 
tients to submit to any dietary changes, and as a mat- 
ter of fact many get along surprisingly well without 
interference with their ordinary habits. We can re- 
peat what we have already said in regard to dieting 
patients — especially older persons — with high blood 
pressure : if dietary restriction causes the patient to 
fret or worry about his condition more harm than good

can arise from insistence. Obviously unwise habits 
should be corrected, but on the whole a suitable diet 
will be the one which tempers the demands of science 
to meet the life-long habits of the individual. Some 
diets in which a moderate amount of fluid is allowed

CHAPTER VII. 

DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 

Perhaps the commonest disease of the stomach is 
acute indigestion. The disease which the newspapers 
often describe as acute indigestion, and which produces 
death, is usually angina pectoris or some other heart 
disease. Acute indigestion is the ordinary upset stom- 
ach occurring from food or drink which disagrees in 
some way ; for example, the green apple stomach ache ; 
the bad after efifect of toa cold or too hot drinks ; the 
result of improperly cooked foods — these are real 
acute indigestion. The symptoms generally noticed 
are referable to both stomach and intestines. The 
dietary rules are logical and simple: give the gastro- 
intestinal canal a rest by taking away all foods except 
perhaps water and weak tea for 24 hours. Then the 
diet is gradually increased, at first using easily digested 
foods which have little "residue" until a normal diet 
is reached. The following diet will give a scheme for 
treating cases of acute stomach disturbances, which, of 
course, must be individualized. Barley water, strain- 
ed gruels, albumen water, broths and soups, soft eggs 
and soft toast may follow the weak tea and water diet. 
Milk diluted with water or seltzer may be given next, 
if milk is well borne. Gelatins, custards and other soft 
milk puddings are useful here. Mashed potatoes and 
strained vegetables are added next, and finally easily 
digested meats as fish or chicken. If no further symp- 

(iSS)

toms are experienced, the patient may then resume his 
former diet. 

ULCER OF THE STOMACH 

By ulcer of the stomach we mean an erosion of the 
lining which may be more or less deep, and more or 
less chronic. In its pathological picture it is so anala- 
gous to an ulcer anywhere on the surface of the body 
that in principle the same treatment is applied — as far 
as possible remove the cause of the ulcer and pre- 
vent further irritation, so as to allow it to heal. In 
the stomach this is not as easily accomplished as on the 
surface of the body, as it is not always easy to remove 
the hyperacid stomach juice which almost always ac- 
companies an ulcer and which probably has a causative 
relation to it. We can, however, attempt to neutral- 
ize this acid by the use of alkalies and proper food. 
Proper food must not only help neutralize the acid, but 
must be non-irritating to the ulcer and of such a nature 
that the work of digestion by the stomach will be re- 
duced to a minimum. In fundamental principles, at 
least, this method does not differ from the methods of 
treating a superficial ulcer. 

There are many surgical aspects to the treatment 
of gastric ulcer, depending on the nature of the change 
in the stomach. A perforated ulcer or one which in 
its development has caused contraction and obstruc- 
tion of the stomach can hardly be benefited by a dietetic 
cure, and before subjecting such a patient to a rigid 



DISEASES OE THE STOMACH. 1 57 

medical treatment judgment must be used in deciding 
whether the patient requires operation. 

Each one of the many diet cures for ulcer of the 
stomach has for its object the attainment of gastric 
rest and the neutralization of the hyperacid gastric 
juice. Every form of dietetic treatment of ulcer has 
two phases — the acute treatment usually carried out 
with the patient on his back, and a continuation of this 
treatment by the patient as he gradually goes about 
his affairs. The latter part of the treatment is un- 
doubtedly the most difficult, because of the many temp- 
tations which meet a man's appetite when he is not 
under direct medical supervision. It is not difficult 
for a patient to follow orders- while he is on his back 
and his tray is brought to hira, but let the same patient 
begin to feel better, and he will find the path of least 
resistance to be to eat what tastes good. Therefore, 
the necessity for much detailed instruction to this pa- 
tient arises, and this instruction should -deal not only 
with his "must not eat" but with his- "may' eat" as 
well. Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the fact 
that seldom if ever does the ordinary "ulcer cure" 
actually cure, but that a long standing supervision of 
diet is necessary. 

There are many diet cures in use, but the principles 
of all are the same: (i) bland food; (2) small quan- 
tities; (3) frequent feedings; (4) gradual increases. 
To accomplish our object we must adapt our method 
to the demands of the individual case. In many cases 
where the ulcer is superficial and producing slight 



158 fOOD FOR THE SICK. 

symptoms, Lenhartz' method may well be used. The 
chart given explains itself, and it is only necessary to 
add that in the beginning the milk, eggs and sugar are 
mixed together, kept ice cold, and fed to the patient 
in teaspoonful doses at frequent intervals. As more 
food is. added the am.ount at each feeding is increased 
and the interval between feedings lengthened.

Continue for three weeks. 

In the course of any diet cure for ulcer other factors 
must be borne in mind as of equal importance. -The 
patient is kept on his back in a state of physical and 
mental rest, an ice bag is kept on the abdomen, and 
large doses of alkali and of bismuth subcarbonate, used 
in cases of hypersecretion, usually are necessary. 
Many cases need no medication other than this. We 
have usiially prescribed sodium bicarbonate and light 
calcined magnesia, 10 grains of each every 4 hours, 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. 1 59 

alternating with bismuth subcarbonate gr. xv or xxx 
every 4 hours. 

Many physicians recomrnend absolute rest for the 
stomach for a few days before starting any diet 
regime. Some cases will even require rectal feeding 
for a few days. Oftentimes milk is not well borne, 
• and as this forms the basis of the usual ulcer diet, it 
must be peptonized or modified by the addition of lime 
water or barley water, or some other alkaline water. 

Cases of ulcer of the stomach cannot be treated by 
any hard and fast rule, but they must be individualized 
and fed accordingly. As there are several types of 
ulcers, different methods of diet as well as of medica- 
tion must be used in treating them. The following 
plan has been used successfully in the treatment of 
some ulcer cases at The Michael Reese Hospital. It is 
impossible to give any stated length of time for the 
use of the diet at the beginning. It may only be neces- 
sary to continue milk and cream for three or four 
days, and it may have to be used for a much longer 
time. That must be decided by the. physician accord- 
ing to the condition of the patient. Many patients 
will be able to reach the sixth stage at the end of two 
or three weeks. This diet, a gastro-intestinal diet 
similar to that given on page 169, must be followed for 
some weeks. Additions to the diet from this time 
should only be made by the physicians in charge, as the 
patient is not cured when he leaves the hospital, and 
he must be told plainly the danger of a return of his 
trouble if he returns to a normal diet too rapidly.

Gastro-intestinal Diet similar to that given on page 
169, avoiding sharp acids. 

More rigid cures are prescribed when the symptoms 
or signs point to a deeper ulcer. Personally we do 
not starve except for hemorrhage or where there has 
been evidence of considerable gastric irritation ; in the 
latter instance only until the disappearance of nausea 
and vomiting; in the case of hemorrhage for 2 to 4 
days. The food is begun very slowly, usually on the 
first day J4 oz. each of milk and cream every hour for 
12 feedings, and continued according to the reaction 
of the patient. 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. 163 

When the patient is ready to get up and out he must 
be impressed with the fact that although his diet is 
being changed, he is to continue to take small doses 
of bland foods at frequent intervals; that all highly 
seasoned foods, fried foods, pastries or other rich foods 
are to be avoided; that alcohol and coffee are poisons 
to him, and that he should never let himself get hun- 
gry- 

With some little application at first most patients 
soon learn to develop a diet suitable to their taste as 
well as the disease, and they get along very well. But 
at times the construction of proper menus is difficult., 
and to ease this burden we refer to some specimen 
menus which have given satisfaction. (See page 169). 



RUIvES FOR GASTRIC ULCER PATIENTS. 

(Post Hospital Care.) 

1. Avoid irregularity of meals. 

2. Do not eat late dinners or midnight suppers. 

3. Do not over-eat. 

4. Avoid highly-seasoned . foods, pickles, pastries, 
fried foods, raw foods, coarse vegetables or any vege- 
tables not thoroughly cooked and strained, coffee or 
tea, alcoholic beverages, acid foods, very hot or very 
cold foods or beverages. 

5. Remember that your diet and your method of 
living require supervision for many months. 



1 64 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

NERVOUS DYSPEPSIA 

Ulcer of the stomach is an organic disease — un- 
doubtedly the most common organic stomach disease, 
but it is probably true that most patients who com- 
plain of symptoms referable to the stomach have no 
organic stomach disease. A person may have pain 
and other pronounced symptoms of stomach trouble, 
without the stomach itself being diseased. Such symp- 
toms are usually due to disturbances somewhere in the 
very complex nervous mechanism controlling the work 
of the stomach. The nervous control of all organs 
can be compared to the system of wires controlling a 
telephone exchange. A short circuit in the basement 
may upset the whole service, or it may merely inter- 
fere with the 'phone in one's office. So, a mental or 
an emotional shock may upset the nervous control of 
the stomach ; fright may produce nausea, intense men- 
tal application not uncommonly upsets a man's diges- 
tion, and the overtired athlete has been known to end 
a race with an attack of vomiting. Such examples 
of emotional and mental control are easy to grasp, be- 
cause they have been experienced by most of us. Such 
nervous conditions, or as they are called "gastric 
neuroses," while not serious, may be extremely dis- 
tressing and require considerable care in treatment. 
Many cases are based on a change or disease elsewhere 
in the body, and the stomach symptoms then have to be 
considered secondary to the seat of the trouble. 

These nervous derangements of the stomach are 
classified into (a) motor, (b) secretory and (c) sen- 



DISEASES OE THE STOMACH. 1 65 

sory disturbances, although rarely does one encoun- 
ter a pure type, as most cases of nervous dyspepsia 
show symptoms referable to all three functions of the 
stomach. From the standpoint of dietetic therapeutics 
it is not necessary to give details about the various 
types of such conditions encountered in practice ; mere- 
ly to mention the many and varied possible symptoms 
will suffice for our purpose. Gurgling and movements 
in the stomach, eructations of gas (many patients call 
this "gas-tritis"), vomiting, spasmodic pain, dull 
aches, heart-bum, variations in appetites may occur 
singly or in a group large enough and distressing 
enough to make a person thjnk his illness is most seri- 
ous. It cannot be emphasized too often that if these 
symptoms are traced to an underlying physical or 
nervous disturbance, treatment must be directed to the 
primary cause of the trouble. It will do no good to 
prescribe a diet for a woman whose symptoms are due 
to exhaustion from work or worry or from a fibroid 
of the uterus, unless we also treat the cause. In many 
men too much work and too little exercise causes con- 
stipation and many stomach symptoms, and in such 
men a diet aimed merely at the stomach symptoms is 
very likely to increase the constipation and do more 
harm than good. 

But if no cause can be found for symptoms, and the 
careful use of the stomach tube, especially the new 
tube of Rehfuss, has shown the exact functional de- 
rangement in the stomach, treatment for the stomach 
will often produce good results. The functional dis- 



1 66 FOOD FOR THg SICK. 

turbance most generally encountered is an excessive 
secretion oif gastric jufce of high acidity, the same 
condition found in ulcer of the stomach. In such 
cases the diet already planned for the second stage of 
ulcer should be used. (See page 169.) Increased 
motility of the stomach produces some of the symp- 
toms enumerated, but this condition is generally asso- 
ciated with hypersecretion and requires practically the 
same treatment. 

ATONY OF THE STOMACH 

Atony of the stomach — ^weakness of the muscular 
walls — requires a different regime. Here the functional 
disturbance is caused by an inability of the stomach to 
perform its muscular work; the diet then should be 
one which while not putting a burden on the stomach 
will nevertheless gradually strengthen the walls, so 
that ultimately they will do their work. The most im- 
portant elements would be the restriction of the amount 
of food and fluid talcen at any time, and the use of 
food which does not require excessive muscular work. 

Friedenwald and Ruhrah recommend the following 
diet for atonic dyspepsia : 

7 A. M. Orange juice 40 gms 80 cal.

Hutchinson prohibits the following foods in cases of 
atonic dyspepsia : 

1. All green vegetables except spinach and cauli- 
flower. Turnips, carrots, peas, beans and lentils. 

2. Fruits except baked apples and stewed prune 
pulp. 

3. Sugars and jam. 

4. Soups. 



1 68 POOD FOR THE SICK. 

5. Bread not toasted. 

6. Tea. 

Potatoes may be taken very sparingly and coffee 
with plenty of milk. However, as little fluid as pos- 
sible must be taken with meals. 

Salisbury advocates an exclusive meat diet for 
atonic dyspepsia of a very severe 'type : 
7 A. M. Hot water. 

Minced beef 2 oz. and upward. 
Water i pt. or less. 
Hot water. 

Minced beef 2 oz. and upwards. 
Water i pt. or less. 
Hot water or clear tea. 
Minced beef 2 oz. and upwards. 
Water i pt. or less. 
10 P. M. Hot water. 

The water should be sipped slowly at about 120- F., 
and not over i^ qts. should be taken daily. Salis- 
bury advocates this treatment only in exceptionally 
severe cases having a liberal gastric secretion, and even 
then for a period not exceeding six weeks. 

ACHYLIA GASTRICA 

One condition sometimes occurring as a gastric neu- 
rosis is known as "achylia gastrica" — a disease of the 
stomach in which too little gastric juice is secreted. 
This condition may occur in cancer of the stomach, 
chronic gastritis, as a gastric neurosis and occasionally

as a secondary manifestation of disease elsewhere in 
the body. Since there is in this condition an absence 
of gastric juice, the diet should be easily digestible, and 
should be well prepared, so that the work of the stom- 
ach is lessened. We append a week's diet for such 
cases, the diet known in the Michael Reese Hospital 
as the "Gastro-intestinal Diet." The use of dilute 
hydrochloric acid and pepsin as an accessory to the diet 
is especially valuable in these cases.

CHRONIC GASTRITIS 

Chronic inflammation of the wall of the stomach is 
in practice a comparatively rare disease, and is seen 
usually only in persons who have exposed their stom- 
achs to the continued insults of alcohol, or poorly cook- 
ed foods, of foods too hot or drinks too cold. It fre- 
quently also occurs as a secondary manifestation of 
some constitutional disease, such as anemia, diabetes 
or especially tuberculosis ; and it may accompany local 
disorders of the stomach, especially cancer. The con- 



172 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

dition of the stomach secretions may vary with the 
stage of the disease; at first an acid secretion may be 
found, but, if the disease is of any standing, anacid- 
ity is ahnost sure to be present. Mucus is always 
found in true gastritis. 

Dietetic treatment in this condition is of the utmost 
importance, but there cannot be a standard diet for 
all such patients. First of all the actual cause of the 
condition must be ascertained and corrected. If the 
patient drinks too much alcohol, no diet will help him 
until the alcohol is removed from his day's routine. If 
excessive indulgence in hot breads is responsible, hot 
breads must be removed. 

After the cause of the disturbance is corrected, a 
well-balanced diet can easily be constructed, but in the 
menu due attention must be paid to idiosyncrasies of 
the patient. It Js a well known fact that a food which 
one man can digest will produce serious stomach symp- 
toms in the next, and it is useless to attempt to force 
all patients to take the same cure. Certain funda- 
mental facts are apparent in any diet for chronic gas- 
tritis. ( I ) Food must not be irritating to the already 
irritated stomach wall, and (2) it should be "bland." 
The gastro-intestinal diet already given (page 169) 
offers a good basis for treatment. 

CANCER OF THE STOMACH 

The dietetic aim for a patient with cancer of the 
stomach would be to give him as much comfort as 
possible, and to allow him to eat what agrees with 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH. 1 73 

him. A distaste for meats is common with such pa- 
tients, and usually fluids and soft foods are best borne. 
It is often difficult to stimulate the appetite for any 
foods, and it seems to us of far more importance to 
prepare the food in an enticing way than to direct the 
use of any special foods. If the caprices of appetite 
carry a patient beyond the bounds of the theoretically- 
indicated foods he should be allowed tO' follow his 
whims. Those in charge of patients with cancer must 
learn to cater to their appetites, but they must also 
learn to see that the food contains nourishing sub- 
stances. Almost any taste can be gratified by care in 
selecting and preparing the articles of diet. (See page 
186.) 



CHAPTER VIII. 

DISEASES OF THE INTESTINES 

ACUTE DIARRHEA 

Diarrhea as an acute manifestation is perhaps most 
frequently caused by the same agents as produce acute 
indigestion — or acute gastritis : something wrong with 
the food or drink. 

The diet for an acute diarrhea must be an easily di- 
gested non-irritating one. In very severe cases ab- 
stinence from all food is often advisable. Barley 
water, weak tea, or plain water may be given to quench 
thirst. Weak cereal waters and gruels given at body 
temperature afford the first nourishment given follow- 
ing the fasting; thin broths, bouillons .and albumen 
waters, boiled milk diluted with lime water, beef juice, 
cold tea flavored with a little lemon juice are often well 
ysed after the cereals. It is, of course, impossible to 
prescribe any set diet for diarrheas. The cause of the 
diarrhea must be found first and the diet will be gov- 
erned by this, of necessity. In general, however, it is 
safe to say, that in cases of either acute or chronic diar- 
rheas all bulky foods, fruits, sour foods, hot liquids and 
alcoholic beverages should be avoided. This proscribed 
list would contain green vegetables, coarse breads, 
fruits, coffee. 

If the disease has been acute and the cause has been 
found and removed, it is often well to proceed as in 
the case of chronic diarrheas in order to avoid iiTitat-

ing the intestines. If milk can be taken at all, and one

CHRONIC DIARRHEA 



Diarrhea, constipation and pain in the abdomen 'are 
the three most usual symptoms of intestinal disease, 



DISEASES OE THE INTESTINES. 1 77 

but what has already been said as to the necessity of 
diagnosing the cause of symptoms in stomach disease 
refers with equal force to the intestines. Diarrhea 
may arise as a result of constipation, and constipation 
itself may result from all sorts of causes. If a patient 
has diarrhea as a result of the irritant action of fecal 
masses, dietary regulations directed to the diarrhea will 
only increase the symptoms; constipation may come 
from bad habits of living or pf going to stool, it may 
be the result of obstruction of the bowels from various 
causes, or it may be a secondary manifestation of some 
stomach disturbance. Of course, exactly the same con- 
dition exists as regards pain in the abdomen. There- 
fore, no symptom or group of symptoms of disease of 
the intestinal tract should receive medical or dietetic 
treatment until the underlying cause is ascertained. 
However, when the real disturbance is once proved 
diet will be found often the most valuable theraupeutic 
asset. 

We must assume then that a diagnosis has been es- 
tablished, and that the diarrhea to be treated belongs 
to one of the groups commonly encountered, which 
may be conveniently discussed under the following 
classification : ( i ) Diarrhea due to Chronic Colitis ; 
(2) Mucous Colitis; (3) Achylia Gastrica; (4) Diar- 
rhoea Nervosa; (5) Amebic' Dysentery; (6) Small 
Intestine Inflammation; (7) "Food Diarrheas." 

There is considerable discussion as to the use of 
various articles of food in these diarrheas, but it seems 
to us that as Friedman [Med. CI., Chic. Vol. 2, Sept., 
12 



178 FOOD FOR rut SICK. 

1916, p. 354,] says, the manner of preparing the food 
is of greater importance than the nature of the food 
given. All irritating parts of food and substances not 
easily absorbable are certainly contra-indicated. There- 
fore, if meat is given it .should be scraped; if vegetables 
are added they must be pureed. 

In the nervous diarrheas produced so easily by the 
slightest emotion in ;i susceptible individual dietary re- 
strictions seem decidedly out of place. Such patients 
are apt to be under-nourished anyhow, and attention to 
their diet will concentrate interest on their ailments 
and cause a pronounced vicious circle, which will re- 
sult in even greater under-nourishment. The way to 
treat these patients is by upbuilding the nervous sys- 
tem and re-education. In the cases of so-called mu- 
cous colitis some men achieve better results by a heavy 
diet aimed at the constipation, others advise bland food. 
We believe that in these cases the diet to be used will 
depend on the nature of the constipation ; if it is of the 
spastic type a bland diet is indicated, if atonic then the 
heavy constipation diet will give better results.

CONSTIPATION 

Constipation as a symptom of other diseases of the^ 
intestines need not be discussed in these pages. As a 
clinical entity — a disease in itself, it occurs frequent- 
ly enough to warrant our devoting considerable space 
to it. Strangely enough some persons have symptoms 
when the bowels do not move at an appointed hour 
each day, whereas others go through life constipated 
and symptomless. In some persons constipation is like 
Topsy ; despite a normal life in every particular it "just 
grows," and very frequently this tendency runs in 
families. In most persons, however, constipation can 
be traced to the method of living or the method of 
eating. Too frequently busy men or careless women 
seem to forget that attention to their bowels is as im- 
portant to health as attention to their business or 



l80 FOOD POR THE SICK. 

household is to success. The man who rushes from 
his breakfast to his business and from his business to 
his pleasures, and thus finds no time to attend to the 
call of Nature, soon finds that the call no longer is 
made; and unless he checks himself in time, he ulti- 
mately finds himself a habitual user of little pills or 
a chronic drinker of laxative waters. His bowels 
which he refused to care for no longer care for him, 
and habitual constipation is his portion. Then there 
are persons whose interest in food is to tickle the palate, 
and who pay no attention to the needs of the stomach 
or intestine ; one may eat food containing more residue 
or undigestible material than his intestines have the 
power to get rid of, the other may not eat enough of 
the coarser foods to provide a stimulus to the intes- 
tine. In making out a normal diet due attention is not 
always paid to the elements of food which afifect in- 
testinal movements. There is another class of persons 
— the so-called nei^vous dyspeptic — who without an 
organic stomach trouble nevertheless have numerous 
stomach complaints traceable to an excessive secretion 
of gastric juice due usually to some nervous complaints. 
Whatever be the original stimulus to these stomach 
symptoms, constipation generally accompanies or fol- 
lows, and a vicious circle is established; constipation 
intensifying the nervous symptoms and the dyspepsia 
intensifying the constipation through the fear of proper 
food. 

The pathological condition of the intestines in con- 
stipation usually may be discovered by physical and 



disi;ases of the intestines. i8i 

X-Ray examination, and should be determined before 
treatment is instituted. Most cases of constipation may- 
be classified under one of three types (a) the atonic 
colon, (b) the spastic colon, (c) the dilated rectum. 
Probably the most common type encountered is the 
atonic colon. 

Practically all patients except those with the spastic 
colon or with the dilated rectum can be subjected to the 
same general scheme of tre'atment, and can be promised 
relief if they persevere in following the rules. Although 
the diet plays a most important role, other elements 
dealing with one's daily routine enter into the treat- 
ment, especially regularity in eating, in exercise and in 
attention to the bowels. In those patients whose con- 
stipation seems the result of too little attention to the 
bowels especial insistence on regularity must be en- 
joined. Those who have neglected exercise and have 
spent their whole time seated at a desk need exercise ; 
either muscular movements, which are so pronounced 
an aid, or outdoor exercise. The nervous dyspeptic 
whose stomach symptoms are definitely proved to be 
functional will often be surprised at the ease with 
which he can digest a dinner of corned beef and cab- 
bage, or other coarse food. But in all patients a rou- 
tine must be enjoined and must be adhered to. We 
have been accustonjed to order patients to follow a 
general scheme which, of course, must be varied to 
suit the individual needs, but which, in general takes 
this form. ( i ) Immediately on arising a glass of hot 
water, (2) all meals at regular hours, (3) a set time

each day for the visit to the toilet. This can not be 
varied, once a set time is settled, and the performance 
of this duty must be considered almost a rite. (4) 
At least one hour's exercise a day, ( 5 ) water in plenty 
between meals, (6) fresh or cooked fruit before -retir- 
ing (vide infra) and (7) gradual reduction of all medi- 
cation.

tion we give a list of foods which we consider bene- 
ficial, and a week's menus. ,

This diet will be found beneficial for most cases of 
constipation, but it is doubtful if it will benefit the pa- 
tients with a spastic colon or with the weak dilated 
rectum. Such patients require a less bulky diet which, 
however, should contain starches, fruit juices and 
strained vegetables. The gastro-intestinal diet (page 
169) forms a good basis for treatment.

CHAPTER IX 

DISEASES OF THE LIVER 

Whether the so-called attacks of "biliousness" so 
frequently complained of by patients are to be con- 
sidered hepatic in origin, or whether they result en- 
tirely from intestinal stasis, is a disputed question. 
From a practical standpoint the treatment would be the 
same in either condition, for any treatment which would 
cause intestinal movements would be apt to cause an in- 
creased flow of bile from the liver. The old fashioned 
method of giving a dose of calomel and salts and a 
temporary starvation diet generally produced results, 
and certainly can not be improved upon unless one ob- 
jects to the use of calomel as a purge. But in patients 
subject to such attacks prevention is better than cure, 
and the physician should attempt to discover the cause 
of the attacks. A person usually active, who is cem- 
pelled to lead a sedentary life, and who as a result be- 
comes constipated, is very likely to become "bilious" 
and just as likely to be free of his biliousness as soon 
as he has regular bowel movements. But there are 
persons subject to the vague symptom complex under 
discussion whose complaints definitely arise from 
dietary indiscretions. Such errors may take any form ; 
one eats sweets in excess, the. next eats too much fat. 
Usually only a cursory analysis of the patient's habits 
is necessary to detect the source of his complaints, and 
if detection is followed by abstinence, a cure will fol- 

(191)

low. Alcohol is undoubtedly a common cause, and we 
are of the opinion that excessive smoking may like- 
wise be indicted as a harmful agent in the production of 
"biliousness." 

During an acute attack while the "cleaning out" pro- 
cess is taking place, as little food as possible should be 
taken and that should be easily digestible, not gas- 
forming, and with little fat, for example : 

Breakfast: Tea, toast, oatmeal with a little milk and 
sugar. 

Dinner: Soup, poached eggs on toast, baked apple, 
glass of milk. 

Supper: Same as dinner. 

Following the attack, food chosen from the following 
diet list may be taken, gradually increasing the variety 
and amount of the food until the diet approaches the 
normal as nearly as possible. In some cases no milk 
can be taken. Very little sugar should be used. 

Lean beef or lamb, white lean fiish, chicken, squab, 
sweetbreads, eggs, custard, junket, buttermilk, skim- 
med milk, green vegetables and salads (without oil), 
small amount of potatoes once daily, rice, tapioca, sago, 
fresh and stewed fruit (very little sugar), weak tea 
and coffee. 

I. 

Breakfast: Stewed prunes, oatmeal with milk, weak 
coffee with milk, dry toast. 

Dinner: Vegetable soup, crackers, roast lamb (very 
lean), small serving boiled potatoes, junket, weak tea 
with milk, toast.

CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER 

The treatment of cirrhosis of the liver will depend 
first on the cause and second on the stage of the disease 
at which treatment is instituted. The commonest types 
of cirrhosis are those produced by alcohol and by 
syphilis ; in both instances diet plays an important role 
13 



194 POOD FOR THE SICK. 

in cure, but the diet will be determined by the condition 
of the patient. It is a fact that many cases of cirrhosis 
of the liver are not diagnosed until long after the onset 
of the disease, when the symptoms are those of cir- 
culatory obstruction or of poisoning. If, however, a 
diagnosis is made early, excellent results can often be 
obtained by proper restrictions of food and drink. When 
alcohol has been the causative agent, abstinence must 
be practiced, and the temperate use of all foods urged. 
The food ingested should be of the non-irritating bland 
type, the amounts taken at any one time should not be 
large, the bowels must move regularly, and the patient 
should lead a well-regulated life. Even when alco- 
hol is not the cause of the cirrhosis it must be strictly 
enjoined in all suffering from liver disease except when 
especially indicated as a stimulant. 

Unfortunately most patients with cirrhosis of the 
liver come for treatment when there are many symp- 
toms due to obstruction. These symptoms may vary 
from dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting — even hematemesis, 
to ascites. In such cases the condition of all the organs 
must be studied before treatment is instituted, and the 
diet to be prescribed will depend almost entirely on the 
condition of the other organs. If the symptoms are 
mainly gastric and there is no ascites, no heart or kid- 
ney involvement, a gastro-intestinal diet will be use- 
ful. Reference to the diets given in Chapter VII for 
chronic gastritis will be helpful in these cases. When 
ascites is present, with or without kidney disturbances, 
at least a temporary employment of a "dry" diet, or 



disi;ases of the liver. 195 

even of the Karell milk cure is advisable. (See 
page 109). 

DRY DIET. 

The dry diet restricts fluids to two pints daily. It 
consists of the ordinary diet with no soups and very 
little tea or coffee. 

When the kidney is involved, the diet to be used 
must depend on the function of the kidney. This has 
been discussed in full (see page 105). In the very 
late stages of the disease when the patient is evidently 
suffering from poisoning the treatment is eliminative, 
and the diet will be mainly composed of milk and milk 
products. 

Finally, in summarizing, we would say in all cases 
of liver complaints, the restrictions are chiefly limited 
in three things, fats, carbohydrates and alcoholic, bev- 
erages. The bile which is secreted by the liver is the 
chief emulsifier of the fats which are consumed. When 
the liver is diseased the flow of the bile is lessened and 
fats cannot be utilized by the body. Hence they are 
of no use to the body, so we necessarily restrict or pro- 
hibit their use according to the severity of the disease. 

One function of the liver is to convert the sugar, 
which has entered the blood, into glycogen. If the 
liver is diseased its glycogen forming power is impair- 
ed so that the intake of starches and sugars must be 
lessened accordingly. 

Alcoholic beverages, unless prescribed by the attend- 
ing physician, should never be taken. Then they are 
usually given well diluted. It is a well known fact 



196 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

that excessive or constant use of alcohol produces cer- 
tain changes in the liver which hinders its usefulness. 

GALL STONES 

In gall stones and in inflammatory diseases of 
the gall bladder diet plays a prominent role both in 
prevention and treatment. Clinical and experimental 
evidence may be accumulated to prove a metabolic in- 
fluence in gall stones — an influence which must be rec- 
ognized even in those cases in which surgical interfer- 
ence is indicated. Persons having had gall stone at- 
tacks should learn certain dietary rules, the most im- 
portant of which are (i) avoid fats; (2) prevent stasis 
of bile. The rules apply as well to the patient already 
treated surgically as to the one on whom we wish to 
prevent an operation, for it has been shown that in 
gall stone disease, as in many other abdominal condi- 
tions, surgery, under certain indications, acts to create 
a condition which cannot be maintained without con- 
tinous and careful control of the nutrition. 

We have just stated that the first rule is the avoid- 
ance of fats, as fats are harmful in two ways: (i) 
they apparently exert a direct chemical influence on the 
formation of stones; (2) they produce indigestion and 
intestinal stasis. Intestinal stasis, by producing a 
slowing up of the whole intestinal canal, is likely to 
dam back the flow of bile, which would assist the 
formation of stones, not only because of the mechanical 
effect but because of the influence of bacteria. 



DISEASES OF THE EIVER. 197 

In persons stibject to gall stones an attempt should 
be made to have the flow of bile almost continuous, 
and perhaps the best way if not the only way to accom- 
plish this end is by a diet making practically a contin- 
uous call on the liver. In other words, the patient 
should eat at frequent intervals, should even eat before 
retiring, and should break the long night fast by a 
large breakfast. In persons whose gall bladder has 
been drained a cessation of the flow of bile into the 
drainage tube can be demonstrated at night, and can 
be relieved by the giving of food. 

A diet then based on the principles just outlined cati 
be given as follows : 

DIET LOW IN FAT. 

Soups: Stock soups, meat broths, from which all 
fat has been removed.

CHAPTER X. 

DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 

Some diseases of the respiratory system are discussed- 
under different headings, and in order to prevent rep- 
etition will not be mentioned in this chapter. In cer- 
tain other diseases the diet plays no important role be- 
yond that indicated for the general condition, of which 
the respiratory disturbance is a part. 

PLEURISY 

Pleurisy may be either dry or wet; in either case it 
is likely to be tuberculous in origin. In the dry fibrin- 
ous pleurisy certainly no especial dietary rules are in- 
dicated. If the disease is acute and febrile it should be 
treated as an acute fever (see Chapter XII, page 223), 
until the acute stage is past. When no longer acute, 
pleurisy means that the patient should be given the 
benefit of the doubt and should receive the same good 
nourishing food which is advocated in the treatment of 
pulmonary tuberculosis (Chapter X, page 204). 

On the other hand, considerable discussion has arisen 
as to the diet in pleurisy with effusion — a discussion 
based on the assumption that a "dry" diet accompanied 
by free watery stools promotes absorption of fluid. 
Theoretically at least such a diet, or even one in which 
salt is restricted, may be indicated and may well be 
tried out in the individual case; but in every case of 
pleurisy with effusion a high caloric nourishing diet 

(201) 



202 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

must be employed. Otherwise we shall find to our 
regret that we have undermined the strength of the pa- 
tient just at the time he needs it most. 

BRONCHIAL ASTHMA 

Bronchial asthma as distinct from the asthma of 
cardiac or renal disease, or that produced by thyroid or 
thymus pressure, is a disease very like hay fever; and 
within recent years a most interesting line of work has 
been opened tending to show that as hay fever repre- 
sents a state of susceptibility to the proteins of certain 
plants, so asthma also represents a state of suscep- 
tibility to protein. In the case of asthma the proteins 
may be (a) inspired through the respiratory tract, (b) 
ingested through the gastro-intestinal tract, or (c) de- 
rived from the bacteria in a focus of infection anywhere 
in the body. The treatment of asthma then would de- 
mand that an attempt be made to discover the offend- 
ing protein. The method to be pursued is, however, 
not always simple; especially if the offender belongs 
to the ingested proteins — the food stuffs. In Chapter 
XI, page 211, on diseases of the skin, we shall discuss 
the skin test by which protein sensitization can be dis- 
covered. If a particular food is found to be at fault 
the patient will frequently be freed of his asthmatic 
attacks merely by the elimination of that food from 
his diet. Butjn cases of asthma, as in other instances 
of food susceptibility, we should not rest content with 
merely finding a food to which the patient reacts. The 
presence of a focus of infection anywhere in the body 



DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. 203 

will often be the primary cause of protein suscepti- 
bility, and until the focus is cleaned out permanent re- 
sults will not result from dietary changes. 

But in not all cases of bronchial asthma can a defi- 
nite cause be localized, and in all cases diet must be 
used which will aid the patient. Many asthmatics know 
certain foods which either produce or intensify their 
attacks, and all asthmatics have learned certain rules of 
eating. An asthmatic patient should not eat large 
meals, should beware of any food which produces in- 
testinal gas and should have regular bowel movements. 
If the asthma has persisted, and is associated with a 
weakening of the heart muscle, special care must be 
exercised in feeding (see myocarditis, page 151). Dur- 
ing an attack the food should be reduced to a minimum ; 
between attacks the rules just laid down will suggest 
the following menu. Only light, easily digested foods 
should be taken. The heavy meal should always be 
taken at noon and the evening meal should be light 
and not too late in the day. 

DIET FOR ASTHMA. 

Breakfast: Stewed fruit, i or 2 eggs, cereal with 
cream, coffee, cream, toast and butter. 

Dinner: Cream or meat soup, small serving of poul- 
try or fish, beef or lamb, potatoes, one easily digested 
vegetable, as spinach, carrots, peas, etc., soft pudding or 
stewed fruit, milk or tea, bread or toast and butter. 

Supper: Rice with cream, one soft cooked tgg, stewed 
fruit, cocoa, bread or toast and butter.

TUBERCULOSIS 

The manifestations of tuberculosis are varied in- 
deed. One patient may have an acutely febrile, rapidly 
progressive disease, the next may have a slow, chronic 
infection with only minor symptoms requiring atten- 
tion; or the disease may present a picture between 
these extremes. In all cases we should use every means 
in our power to increase the patient's resistance, and 
the means commonly employed have this object in view. 
We give the patient a combination of fresh air, sun- 
light, rest — ^physical and mental, and good food. With- 
out a healthy surrounding food will not be of much 
avail, nor will it benefit a patient to send him "west to 
a warmer climate" unless we are sure that he will have 
good food when' he gets there. The factors in a cure 
are potent for good only when grouped together, so 
that in the individual patient it is often necessary to 
emphasize one neglected factor in order to equalize all. 

Although food does play such an important role in 
the cure of tuberculosis, we do not believe that the 
giving of proper food is equivalent to overfeeding. In 
fact, our experience with tuberculous patients -leads us 
to believe that at least in some cases overfeeding is 
' decidedly contra-indicated. The tuberculous patient re- 
quires strength rather than fat, and often the attempt to 
"put on flesh" adds such a burden to the digestive sys- 
tem as seriously to interfere with the proper healing of 
his tuberculous focus. 

There are two elements in feeding (i) the state of 
nutrition, (2) the appetite and digestion. It is obvi- 



DISEASES OE THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. 205 

ous that the strength to resist an infection is not pos- 
sible with a man whose general system is undernourish- 
ed, and it is equally obvious that a person whose appe- 
tite and digestion are impaired can not successfully as- 
similate food unless we assist his digestion by the 
proper choice of food substances. 

We shall not discuss the feeding problem in institu- 
tions for the tuberculous, where the purely medical 
side is so closely bound with the problems of ad- 
ministration and of economics, but shall direct our ef- 
forts to the feeding of the tuberculous patient at his 
home or wherever his individual tastes and caprices can 
be learned and appealed to. 

Speaking then entirely of the individual patient, our 
problem is to put him in a good state of nutrition, and 
if necessary improve appetite and digestion. These 
rules apply to all patients ; with some undernourishment 
results from digestive disturbances, with others it may 
be due to a poorly selected diet. The acutely ill tuber- 
culous patient with fever, and, perhaps hemorrhages, 
will not eat the same food we would give to a rrian 
with a less virulent infection ; but even the febrile pati- 
ent should as soon as possible receive' a high caloric 
diet. If his fever is high and he is at absolute 
(bed) rest, a diet such as we have already described as 
the "High Caloric Typhoid Diet" (see page 39) as 
a rule will be well assimilated. This would apply to 
the very sick patient at any stage of the disease. 

The digestive disturbances and lack of appetite 'of 
the less severely ill will often disappear when his sur- 



206 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

roundings are changed and he learns to "take life easy" 
and to live out-doors. ' But it may be necessary to sup- 
plement our diet instructions with information obtained 
by the stomach tube and analyses of the stool. If hypo 
or hyperacidity is present it must be taken into con- 
sideration and the diet modified to meet the actual con- 
ditions in the stomach. (See pages i68 and i6g). If 
there is evident distress after certain foods, or if the 
examination of the stools shovsfs deficiency of digestion 
of any particular food it is wise to withhold such foods 
from the diet. When constipation arises, the food must 
be considered from this standpoint (see page 179). 
Ordinarily speaking a well balanced normal diet (see 
page 36) is the best food we can prescribe for a tuber- 
culous patient, provided attention is paid to the particu;- 
lai- demands of the individual. When there is evident 
under-nutHtion the patient should, of course, be built up 
to a normal weight, or even beyond his normal; but 
nothing is gained in the long run by overwhelming the 
tuberculous patient with food. As a rule three square 
meals a day, in which the proportions of protein, fat 
and carbohydrate are properly balanced, will give a 
patient all the nutrition he needs or can well use. As a 
means of filling a day's schedule and of relieving the 
routine of the "cure," small between-meal feedings 
may be used, but are by no means necessary. 

We have for a long time had in actual practice the 
method of feeding just described. Our tuberculous 
patients, rich or poor, are told to eat without special 
regard to any particular food or class of foods, and 



DISEASES OE THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. 207 

most seem to get along very well indeed. Of course, 
the patient whose gastro-intestinal canal requires at- 
tention receives special instruction; but as a rule such 
disturbances are minor and of short duration. It 
must be emphasized again that although under-nutri- 
tion must be combatted, mere addition of weight to a 
tuberculous patient does not necessarily mean an im- 
provement in his lung condition, and should never be 
the ultimate goal of the treatment.

But as tuberculosis is so commonly fotmd among the 
poorer classes of people, we must also give a rational 
plan of feeding which will combine economy and diet- 
etic value and will thus be practicable to many suf- 
ferers to whom the preceding examples of liberal diets 
for tuberculosis are inhibitive. Butterine or oelomar- 
garine may be substituted for butter, lowering the 
economic but not the nutritive value of the food. 
Cornmeal, hominy, rice, macaroni and beans may be 
used liberally to raise the carbohydrate value of the

CHAPTER XI. 
DISEASES OF THE SKIN 

There are certain diseases of the skin which are 
caused by errors in diet and certain others which sure- 
ly are influenced by food. Yet on the whole the diet- 
ary control of diseases of the skin cannot be said to 
be very satisfactory. At present, however, a consid- 
erable amount of research is going on which may have 
an important bearing in associating many skin dis- 
eases with disorders of nutrition. More diseases are 
constantly being considered from the viewpoint of in- 
dividual susceptibility — sensitization — to some partic- 
ular food-stuff, and in the study of such relations use 
is freely made of the skin reaction made familiar by 
von Pirquet. In the cases of foods, extracts of vari- 
ous suspected materials are made- and the patient test- 
ed just as he would be tested for von Pirquet's tuber- 
culin test ; the person sensitive to a particular food will 
react just as a tuberculous patient will react to the 
von Pirquet test. Although much valuable informa- 
tion has already been derived from this line of work, 
especially in regard to urticaria and eczema, we do not 
feel that as yet far-fetching conclusions are justifiable. 

Bulkley has pointed out various theoretical ways in 
which diet may influence skin disorders. 

I. There may be a direct irritating action from the 
ingesta upon the stomach and intestine producing a 
reflex skin eruption, as in erythemas and urticaria from 
shellfish, strawberries, mush, etc. 

(211) 



212 FOOD FOR THF SICK. 

2. Articles of diet may produce various forms of gas- 
tric and intestinal indigestion leading to the produc- 
tion of imperfectly elaborated material or to toxins 
which then have a direct irritating effect on the circu- 
lation through the capillaries, or on the skin during 
their elimination, as in acne from excessive indulg- 
ence in sweets, and some other affections from an ex- 
cessive protein diet. 

3. Possibly certain food elements may have an ac- 
tion directly on the skin in a manner similar to that of 
some drugs, as the iodides and bromides. 

4. Errors in diet may consist in the absence of cer- 
tain elements requisite for the proper and exact nutri- 
tion of the skin. 

A good general rule to follow in the dietary treat- 
ment of skin diseases is this, "the more acute the der- 
matitis the more restricted the diet." This measure is 
in accord with the known medical law which demands 
putting an inflamed part at rest, and it is obvious that 
an inflamed skin, like the rest of the body, may obtain 
functional rest by cutting down the amount or chang- 
ing the character of the food. An itching skin will 
not tolerate articles of diet such as alcohol or highly 
spiced foods which intensify itching and other inflam- 
matory symptoms by increasing the blood supply to the 
already highly vascularized areas. 

ECZEMA (Aduit Type) 

No absolute rule can be laid down regarding the 
diet in eczema. Each individual should be given the 



DISE;AS]eS Of THB SKIN. 213 

quantity and quality of food necessary to nourish the 
body without interfering with digestion and elimina- 
tion. Most patients with eczema eat an excess rather 
than an insufficient amount of food. It is well for 
eczematous individuals to avoid the beginning and the 
end of a meal. Soups do harm by diluting the gas- 
tric juice or by producing indigestion because of their 
fat content. The patient should avoid all fried foods, 
all highly seasoned food, "rich" food such as dough- 
nuts, pastries and hot breads, food of high caloric 
value such as cheese, nuts, raisins, very sweet pre- 
serves, candies, soda water with heavy syrup. Coffee 
or tea may not be harmful, but water should be taken 
freely. Probably the fame of the various mineral 
springs in skin diseases is due not to the particular 
kind of water consumed but to the quantity that indi- 
viduals , frequenting these resorts feel it their duty to 
drink. In an eczema associated with glycosuria the 
usual diet for that condition should be instituted (see 
Chapter III). If in eczema the skin reaction already 
mentioned shows a definite susceptibility to one par- 
ticular kind of food, that food should be entirely 
eliminated from the diet. 

In some of the very acute and generalized eczemas 
met with good results can frequently be obtained by 
limiting the patients to a low caloric diet. Bulkley 
employs rice, bread and water and restricts the entire 
dietary to these foods until the acuteness subsides. 



214 food for the sick. 

Buckley's "Rice Diet." 

Rice boiled in water for y^ hour, then left uncovered 
to dry out for 15 or 20 minutes. 

Fine white bread at least 24 hours old. 

Butter is used freely, at least ^ pound daily. 

Water hot or cold (not iced) drunk separately from 
food. 

All food is thoroughly masticated, giving J^ hour 
to each meal. The rice is eaten with a fork. The diet 
is kept up 5 days for an acute eruption and is repeated 
or continued as necessary. 

INFANTILE ECZEMA . 

The dietary treatment of infantile eczema has been a 
much disputed question, and at some time or other 
each of the four cardinal food constituents has been 
held to be at fault. The general opinion to-day is that 
eczematous children are over-fed, although oc- 
casionally even in properly fed individuals, adults as 
well as children, one sees an eczema produced or re- 
cur i^pon the ingestion of some particular article of 
food, as for example ^^^ white, oatmeal or buck- 
wheat flour. This reaction is undoubtedly anaphylac- 
tic in nature. It is surprising to see the excellent re- 
sults accomplished by merely cutting down the quan- 
tity of food in eczematous infants. It is the general 
rule to diminish the quantity of all four food elements, 
although it has been recently advanced that one may 
have an infantile eczema due to excessive fat or one 
due to excessive sugar ; the former being of the weep- 



DISEASES OP The skin. 215 

ing type, the latter dry. The diet then is the most im- 
portant part of the treatment, and more stress should 
be laid on the diet than on the local care of the skin. 
The latter should be protective and non-irritating. 

In the case of eczema occurring in nursing children 
the calories can be diminished by reducing the num- 
ber and duration of feedings. In addition the ad- 
ministration of water sweetened with a little sugar, if 
necessary, before each feeding, will satisfy the child's 
hunger and yet by "spoiling his appetite" prevent the 
intake of too much milk. 

As the child grows older broths and fruit juices 
which have a small food value can be given with the 
idea of satisfying the appetite without increasing the 
caloric value of the food. In still older patients coarse 
vegetables can be substituted for the rich cereals, but- 
ter, cream, jellies and cakes which these children 
iisually eat in excess. As a rule, when a nursing child 
with eczema is put on a mixed diet, the eczema im- 
proves or even disappears. In many children the ques- 
tion resolves itself into the choice of food, as many of 
the patients are fed substances totally unfit for even 
the adult stomach. It is common experience to en- 
counter eczema in children who have been fed such 
indigestible foods as sweet cakes, candy, or pastries, 
cabbage, bananas, pickles; and in these cases the ec- 
zema is likely to disappear when the offending food- 
stuffs are removed. 

The nursing mother is often responsible for the 
eczema of her child. Excessive use of tea, chocolate, 



2l6 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

beer or wine may so interfere with the mother's di- 
gestion and assimilation of foods as definitely to affect 
her milk supply. When such indiscretions are dis- 
covered prompt attention must be directed to the 
source of supply. 

ACNE 

The dietary care of the patients with acne (vul- 
garis and rosacea) is of considerable importance, al- 
though it cannot be said that dietary errors alone pro- 
duce the disease. The majority of acne patients are 
constipated, are big eaters and with little or no ten- 
dency to exercise. It is therefore advisable to put 
these individuals on a coarse diet of a relatively low 
caloric value in addition to exercise and general hy- 
giene. It is wise, in order to reduce food errors to 
a minimum, to ask the patient to carry a small note 
book in which he jots down each article eaten and 
any article that he may desire to eat. This book is in- 
spected weekly and all necessary corrections made. 

DIET FOR ACNE. 

Milk, eggs, fat meats, butter, potatoes (in excess), 
bananas, tea, coffee, pastries, soups, alcohol, nuts, 
cheese, cocoa and chocolate, spices, condiments and 
all highly seasoned or concentrated foods are pro- 
hibited. Graham or bran bread is advised to be eaten 
at all meals. 

A list of permissible foods follows. 
Meats. Lean beef, lamb, fish, chicken. 



DISEASES OE THE SKIN. 21/ 

Vegetables. Spinach, cabbage, cauliflower, Brus- 
sels sprouts, string beans, carrots, beets, peas, turnips, 
parsnips, corn, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, romaine, en- 
dive, radishes. 

Fruits. Fresh and stewed, except bananas. 

Cereals. All kinds in moderate amounts. 

Beverages. Lemonade, orangeade, water, (some- 
times cofifee with cream). 

Bread. All coarse breads, graham, bran, rye and 
wheat. 

Breakfast: Fruit, wheat bread with an equal part of 
dry breakfast food and cream, Graham toast and 
honey, cofifee and cream. 

Luncheon: Cold meat (roast beef, veal, mutton or 
fowl), two coarse vegetables (beets, carrots, turnips, 
parsnips, sweet potatoes, cabbage, green beans or peas, 
sweet corn, radishes, tomatoes, lettuce, etc.), and 
stewed fruit. 

Dinner: Meat (beefsteak, lamb chop, fish or fowl), 
two coarse vegetables, fruit Salad, coffee or tea. 

In acne rosacea one employs much the same scheme. 
In these cases, the harmfid effect of alcohol is probably 
more apparent than in any other skin disease. In acne 
rosacea alcohol seems to exert its action especially on 
the circulation, and it is very common to see the red 
"whiskey nose" in alcoholics, although the excessive 
use of any other stimulant, as tea or coffee, can pro- 
duce the same picture. 



2l8 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

PSORIASIS 

A vegetable diet has been recommended for many 
years for patients with psoriasis. In some cases one 
obtains results with such a regime, but the majority 
of psoriatics fail to respond to any special diet. We 
do know, however, that patients with psoriasis, 
especially the acute form, improve on a low protein 
diet, and Schamberg has shown a nitrogen retention 
which diminishes as the patient improves or recovers. 
Perhaps these individuals improve in the summer be- 
cause of the restricted meat and protein diet during 
that season. Alcohol has been known to aggravate 
or start anew an attack of psoriasis. Cofifee, cocoa, 
chocolate, because of their xanthin content, are harmful 
in psoriasis. 

URTICARIA 

Hives, which might well be called the "great tor- 
mentor" are so common as to warrant considerable at- 
tention. Unfortunately for the sufferer from hives, 
scientific knowledge of the condition is limited, as is 
evident from the numerous methods of cure and the 
chronicity of many cases. The acute attack of hives 
commonly follows some indiscretion in diet, and 
usually is quickly relieved by prompt emptying of the 
gastro-intestinal canal. Some persons can produce an 
attack at will by eating a particular article of food — 
one man cannot eat berries, another can produce hives 
by eating fish food, a third has an idiosyncrasy to 
some other article of diet. 



DISEASES OE THE SKIN. 219 

Chronic urticaria may develop after an acute attack, 
but in by no means all cases can a definite article of 
food be discovered as the cause. It has seemed to us 
that perhaps medical men have gone too far in assum- 
ing a food insult as the cause of most cases of chronic 
urticaria; certainly in many cases we have over-em- 
phasized the food element at the expense of the direct 
skin condition. This is an angio-neurosis — an effusion 
of serum through the skin capillaries, and the direct 
cause of the effusion is some instability in the minute 
nerves controlling the capillaries. Pood often plays 
a primary role, but on the other hand the condition can 
occur apparently as a pure neurosis. 

It is no small task to prove whether any particular 
food element is at the bottom ocf chronic urticaria, or 
what the particular food is. In some cases, as in acute 
urticaria, the patient knows that his hives appear when 
he eats fresh fruits or meat, and in such cases the cure 
is easy. The patient may be "tested out" by a dietary 
regime which, starting with purgation and starvation is 
gradually and carefully increased by the addition of one 
article of food at a time. Sometimes the offender may 
be caught in this manner, or it may be possible to vac- 
cinate the patient with numerous foods. If he is "sen- 
sitive" to a particular food he will respond with a 
characteristic "wheal" at the site of the vaccination. 
Since it is difficult to procure material for vaccination 
from all kinds of food, this procedure will not always 
be successful. 



220 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

As a routine practical procedure to detect a possible 
cause of hives we have usually first completely starv- 
ed and purged our patient, giving nothing but water 
for one or two days. Milk is then given, often with 
buttermilk (Bulgarian Bacillus). Then bread, the 
various cereals, Urst zvithout sugar; the various vege- 
tables, fruits, meats, etc., are added always one at a 
time; but often despite such a course we have been 
unable to locate a definite food idiosyncrasy. In fact, 
we have seen patients do better on a ftdl unrestricted 
diet than on a smaller fare, and in these cases it has 
seemed unwise to continue the tests. In some cases, 
however, we have found definite food causes, as fresh 
fruit or vegetables, animal protein in any form. In 
these cases it is good policy to attempt to find an even 
more remote pathological condition whose presence 
makes the food poisonous for the individual; this 
may be a disturbance in the gastro-intestinal canal 
or even an infection in some other part of the body. 
From our experience with food idiosyncrasies of vari- 
ous sorts we firmly believe that such an apparent idio- 
syncrasy may be only a secondary metabolic expression. 
This idiosyncrasy will be manifest until the primary 
cause is discovered and removed. 

FURUNCULOSIS 

In furunculosis an excess of sugar may be found in 
the blood. This conforms to our clinical observation 
that furuncles are common in individuals who over- 
eat carbohydrates. It is therefore advisable to limit 



DISEASES OE THE SKIN. 221 

the ingestion of sugars and starches in such patients; 
the "carbohydrate-free diets," given in Chapter III, will 
be found useful. In many patients who resist ordin- 
ary therapeutic methods resort to such a diet will be 
followed by an immediate cure. 



CHAPTER XII. 

FEVERS 

We can hardly talk about feeding- in fevers unless 
we modify our remarks to suit the special case. Fever 
is usually the result of an infection, and both the fever 
and the poisoning of an infection increase the body 
metabolism. In some cases where the disease is of 
short duration, this increased metabolism and the re- 
sulting loss of body weight are not of as great im- 
portance to the patient as are other considerations ; for 
example, pneumonia is usually a disease of such short 
duration and uncomplicated convalescence that we need 
not' fear the temporary loss of weight which might re- 
sult from a diet used to spare the heart. On the other 
hand, typhoid fever is a long and tedious drain on the 
patient who needs to conserve all his energy if he is 
successfully to overcome the infection and pass 
through convalescence without relapse. In typhoid 
fever, one of the most important elements in treatment 
should be a deliberate attempt to maintain nutrition, 
but in pneumonia this is of minor importance as com- 
pared to the danger of cardiac insufficiency, or even of 
meteorism — intestinal putrefaction and gas. In other 
fevers, too, special stress is laid on other features, as for 
example scarlet fever, where the diet and all treatment 
must always have in view the danger of its most seri- 
ous complication — nephritis. 

(223) 



224 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

It seems evident, then, that there can be no definite 
diet for fever, no set of rules to govern all cases. In 
the acute infections of short duration often one of the 
most marked symptoms is loss of appetite, and in such 
cases it is obviously unvi^ise to try to force food. The 
use of liquid foods in these cases has the double ad- 
vantage of being usually more easily assimilated and 
digested than solids and of furnishing a larger amount 
of water. Some patients show a peculiar capricious- 
ness of appetite during fever, and it is probably true 
that no harm will arise if the demand for strange foods 
be answered. In fact, generally speaking, the appe- 
tite and desires of the patient must be considered even 
when fluids alone are employed, and the comfort and 
well-being of the patient more often depend on the 
art of the cook than on the orders of the physician. 

It is not always easy to furnish a suitable fluid diet, 
which is especially true when for some reason milk 
is not well borne. When milk is part of the diet it, 
of course, forms the basis of any fluid regime; but 
it rarely can be used extensively for any period of 
time without variations. Milk can be used in so many 
-different ways, pleasing to a patient who dislikes it 
pure, that we have collected in this chapter many 
recipes, some of which are sure to prove satisfactory. 
The various modifications of milk now extensively 
used in the sick room, as, for example, malted milk or 
buttermilk, also furnish excellent material for a fluid 
diet. Raw eggs, either whole or merely the albumen, 
can be served alone or combined with various drinks; 



FEVERS. 225 

Stock soups and meat extracts, while of little value as 
fuel, have considerable value as stimulators of appe- 
tite and for their water content. 

Alcoholic beverages are rarely necessary as food, 
except when the patient has been a heavy drinker. 
Occasionally champagne will be of value when noth- 
ing else is retained by the stomach, and enough brandy, 
whiskey or sherry to flavor a milk drink will often 
stimulate an otherwise sluggish appetite. There are 
times when alcohol is necessary as a stimulant — in 
which cases it is given not as a food but as medicine. 
Tea or coffee are used at the discretion of the physi- 
cian. Fruit juices and the "soft" drinks are useful 
adjuncts to a liquid diet and will help considerably in 
adding variety. 

The class of cases for which such a liquid diet is 
suitable are the acute uncomplicated fevers of short 
duration. In this group we include the acute infec- 
tions of the upper air passages^ — ^tonsrlitis, "cold in the 
head," influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia; some of the 
more acute "contagious diseases," as for example — 
measles, mumps, meningitis, diphtheria, erysipelas, 
etc. Acute articular rheumatism in its earlier stages 
may also be classified in this heading. 

If a liquid diet is ordered, it is well to plan a diet 
on a two-hour schedule, and, as already mentioned, 
especial attention should be paid to the reqtrirements 
of the individual appetite. Certainly care in selecting 
some of the appended preparations will be gratefully 
appreciated by the patient.

234 FOOD FOR THU SICK. 

Some physicians never consider it necessary to limit 
a diet strictly to fluids, and from the beginning of an 
acute infection they allow the addition of "soft" 
articles of food, as, for example, strained cereals, 
vegetable purees, soft toast (milk or broth), stewed 
fruits, mashed potato, gelatines, etc. Whether one 
agrees with this practice or not, it is certainly true that . 
as soon as the acute process is over additions such as 
these to the diet should be made as quickly as the pa- 
tient's appetite allows. A "soft" diet would embrace the 
fluids already discussed and any of the following 
articles : 

Milk toast, soft eggs, custards and other soft milk 
puddings, ices and ice creams, strained vegetables and 
fruits, mashed potato, strained cereals, butter.

As convalescence is established and the patient ap- 
proaches the normal, the diet is gradually or rapidly 
increased, depending entirely on the general welfare 
and appetite of the individual. At the close of any 
uncomplicated infection it can be said that a normal 
full diet cannot be reached too quickly. In influenza, 
for example, the drop in temperature to normal usually 
means the end of the disease, but the patient is apt to 
be more profoundly weakened than he realizes, and his 
diet should be increased rapidly. After the crisis in 
pneumonia complications usually are not encountered 
unless it be empyema; but the severe cardiac strain 
prevents too rapid an increase in food. As we have 
already said, the details of increasing food must be 
established for the individual case; but as an example 
of the general method we usually employ we shall now 
cite the diet we usually employ with our pneumonia 
patients :

238 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

If milk is well borne it should form the major part 
of the diet during the acute stage of the disease. 
Plenty of water shpuld be given also and acid bev- 
erages are very valuable during the severe stage. 

As frequent feedings are necessary, 4 to 6 ounces of 
milk may be given every 2 or 3 hours. Gradually, as 
the fever abates, semi-solid food may be added to the 
diet. In some cases we have had very good success 
in feeding the high caloric diet which we use for 
typhoid fever. Then the return to a full diet is sim- 
ilar also. If milk is not well borne, broths, whey, 
malted rhilk, egg albumin and liquid beef preparations 
must be used. Starches and sugars are not well borne 
usually, and so are best omitted from the diet. 

TYPHOID FEVER 

At present the standard diet for typhoid fever pa- 
tients is a so-called "high caloric" diet. The adoption 
of this type of diet is based primarily on the facts ( i ) 
that the long continued fever and intoxication of the 
infection increase metabolism and reduce weight by 
burning of body fat and protein, (2) this loss of weight 
and strength lowers the resistance of the patient, and 
(3) to a great extent it can be prevented by proper 
diet. The food should, of course, be easily digested 
and assimilated, and should contain no coarse residue 
which entering the intestine might irritate or even rup- 
ture the ulcers constantly present in this disease. The 
older method of feeding milk or milk and albumen 
water was based on the idea that solid food would in- 



FEVERS. 239 

crease the fever and would be more dangerous to the 
inflamed intestine than was milk; but it is true that 
milk entering the stomach a liquid may enter the in- 
testine a curdled, solid mass, whereas a mashed po- 
tato or a dish of gelatine may be liquified by the time 
the inflamed intestine is reached. Practical tests at 
the bedside have now shown conclusively that we 
need not fear complications when we feed our ty- 
phoid patients liberally, but that on the other hand 
complications are less likely to occur, convalescence is 
shortened, and the patient recovers from the disease 
more nearly like a human being than a starved skele- 
ton. 

It is, however, often difficult to make the typhoid 
fever patient take his food, and all sorts of dietary 
artifices may be necessary to suit his appetite and his 
digestion. Frequent feeding of small amounts is more 
likely to succeed than trying to give a few large meals, 
and for that reason the patient should be given some- 
thing every two hours; although we do not believe it 
a wise practice to disturb his slumber at night for food 
unless we cannot get him to eat during the day. 
Especially in the beginning of the disease it is often 
difficult to force the patient to eat, and yet this is the 
most important time to establish his schedule, for 
if the patient acquires the habit early it is much 
sirripler to continue later when food is needed. 

We have used the following high caloric diets in the 
Michael Reese Hospital with good success. The pa- 
tients on the whole have taken the food well, and when

As this diet is liberal, we increase the diet very 
slowly during convalescence. A little apple sauce is 
added with the breakfast, no other change being made 
for a few days. Then we add a small amount of 
strained mashed potato tO' the noon meal. Strained 
peas or some other light vegetable is next added, and 
lastly a small amount of minced chicken; within a few 
days scraped beef or minced fish are alternated with the 
chicken to afford a variety. We very often give the 
patient a gastro-intestinal diet (see page 169) before 
giving rnore solid food, then very gradually change 
the diet so that he receives stewed fruit and vegetables 
without straining. Raw food should be avoided for 
weeks and sometimes months after the patient is able 
to leave the hospital. 

Some physicians still use milk almost entirely 
through the acute stage of typhoid fever, so we give 
Coleman's Milk, Cream and Lactose Diets as ex- 
amples of the fluid diet.

FEVERS. 243 

SCARLET FEVER 

A special word is necessary concerning scarlet fever, 
because, as we have already stated, in scarlet we always 
' fear and must try to prevent the onset of nephritis. 
On account of the fear of this serious complication, 
milk for years has been the accepted food for patients 
with this disease, but in more recent times careful com- 
parative studies of parallel series of patients have 
shown that a more liberal diet does not increase the in- 
cidence of nephritis. It seems to us, however, that 
some caution should be exercised and that the patient 
should be guarded, and at least during the height of 
the fever milk should form the main article of food. 
If the patient is not too sick the addition of some soft 
foods of the farinaceous type, or stewed fruits, or of 
vegetable purees can not possibly do harm and can be 
given from the beginning. As soon as the fever sub- 
sides the patient should receive enough food to main- 
tain nutrition, but despite the investigations quoted 
above we believe it wise to refrain from excessive use 
of protein or of salt. Although protein and salt may 
not be potentially dangerous, yet it is better to err on 
the side of caution, especially since enough calories can 
easily be supplied without protein. 

A diet scheme on this basis would not be difficult to 
construct: reference to the lists already given in this 
chapter will supply the information needed. 

"RHEUMATISM" 

"Rheumatism" is a word which by itself has no 
place in the literature of medicine ; we use it here simply 



244 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

as a convenient handle for a group of diseases com- 
monly and erroneously classed together, and we use 
it mainly to show the error of this grouping. For 
this word as too often employed is made to embrace 
everything or anything which causes pain in the mus- 
cles or joints. Excepting gout, which has been dis- 
cussed, there is nothing in the course of rheumatic 
troubles which suggests metabolic disturbances. The 
acute arthritis cases should be treated as ordinary acute 
fevers (see page 225) ; the chronic joint disturbances 
should receive as much good nourishing food as pos- 
sible, just as other chronic infectious diseases are fed 
up in the efifort to increase resistance.. The so-called 
muscular rheumatism is usually the result of an inflam- 
matory reaction in the muscles to some absorbed toxin, 
and diet can have little, if any, effect on its course. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

OBESITY 

The dietary problem of most general popular in- 
terest is the one associated with obesity. Every fat 
person wants to grow thin, but few are willing to 
work toward that end or to make sacrifices to do so. 
There are patients whom one wants to reduce for 
definite medical reasons, but most persons who diet 
for obesity have a pure cosmetic motive. The prob- 
lem of why some persons are stout and others thin 
is as yet unsolved ; we know of course that a tendency 
to obesity or to thinness may run in families, but we 
do not know the basic reason for this tendency. We 
call this an hereditary constitutional tendency, which 
in terms of metabolism means nothing. Not all stout 
persons are by any means heavy eaters, and not all 
heavy eaters are stout; but despite this apparent fact 
obesity arises from a disproportion between the amount 
of food taken and the amount actually burned by the 
body. A woman approaching her menopause may 
put on fat although she does not change her diet in 
any way ; and in this case there is probably a diminish- 
ed use of food because of deep chemical changes re- 
sulting from the diminished ovarian secretion. On 
the other hand the athlete at the training table eating a 
carefully selected diet and taking plenty of exercise 
will stay "fit," but allow him to stop exercise and to 
eat more freely and he will "put on flesh." In the 

(245) 



246 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

case of the woman at the menopause there is no 
change in food' intake, and the obesity results from a 
disturbance of body metabolism: in the case of the 
athlete, increased weight results from a combination 
of two factors (i) increased food and (2) diminished 
energy. On the other hand a man who all of his life 
has been accustomed to a sparse diet, but who sud- 
denly becomes prosperous and eats accordingly is 
very likely to grow fat merely because he increases 
his food supply, without correspondingly increasing 
his energy. 

So then the causes of obesity may be summarized 
in brief as follows: (i) a constitutional tendency, (2) 
overeating, (3) diminished expense of energy, (4) a 
combination of 2 and 3. 

It is not always easy to prove that an obese person 
belongs to one of the groups 2, 3 or 4. Many men 
and women really think they do not overeat and do 
take enough exercise, and when asked to put on paper 
the exact amount of food they consume, the exercise 
they take, the alcohol they drink, and the amount of 
sleep they indulge in are greatly surprised at the 
physician's proof of their over-eating. This attitude 
is of course not an attempt to deceive, but is merely 
the result of ignorance of food values. If careful in- 
quiry into the details of ordinary life be made in all 
obese patients, many, apparently constitutionally fat, 
will prove to be obese because of a disproportion be- 
tween food intake and energy consumed. 

In all cases the principle of the cure will be the 



OBESITY. 247 

same, but the application will have to vary for the in- 
dividual patient. The foods from which fat is most 
easily made are the carbohydrates and the fats, the 
main ingredients of those foods which stout persons 
enjoy most. The fundamental concept in treatment 
then will be the reduction of the amount of carbohy- 
drates and fats in the diet. But it is not sufficient to 
tell a fat person merely to restrain from fat-forming 
foods; other foods must be provided to take their 
place. In those cases where an evident excess of 
sweets such as candy, pastry or ice-cream is the cause 
of the trouble, and where the aim of treatment is 
merely to prevent further increase in weight, it is 
often necessary merely to remove the noxious sweets 
from the diet. In most cases, however, excessive detail 
must be provided. It is not sufficient to tell a patient 
to eat much protein and many vegetables; you have 
to write out his menus for him. The success of a 
certain popular method of achieving thinness is due to 
the fact that diets are printed; the patient does not 
have to devote any energy to figuring out what he 
may or may not -eat; he is told from day to day and 
week to week what to eat, and he is urged to follow 
the menus without change — except perhaps of taste. 
There are many cures for obesity, most of which 
are given at the end of this chapter. Most of them 
are too strenuous for ordinary usage, and some are not 
without potential harm. It is our practice in handling 
such cases to employ the following method : 
I. Get a detailed diary of the patient's life. 



248 FOOD FOR THE SICK. 

II. Examine patient. 
III. Using this as a basis for correction, prescribe 
(a) the amount of sleep; (b) the amount of exercise; 
(c) the diet. In figuring out the diet we (i) dimin- 
ish the total caloric intake; (2) diminish intake of fats 
and carbohydrates to a minimum compatible with the 
health of the individual and his occupation; (3) con- 
trol the water intake. 

Speaking of the last element first, we do not feel 
that excessive restriction of fluids helps greatly in all 
cases, but occasionally water restriction is found neces- 
sary. Drinking at meals, being a bad habit at best, is 
not allowed, but the more recent studies clearly show 
that only in certain exceptional cases does water intake 
really influence metabolism. 

In giving the various known "obesity cures" we wish 
again to "emphasize that indiscriminate dieting for 
obesity is a procedure not entirely devoid of danger. 
We do not believe that any person should undertake 
treatment except under the advice and care of a physi- 
cian. With proper guidance good results can be ob- 
tained without the harm which may result from too ex- 
cessive employment of inanition. A cure which re- 
duces slowly is better, safer, and more permanent than 
any radical one.

CHAPTER XIV. 
ANEMIA, SCURVY AND GOITRE 

ANEMIA 

It is necessary briefly to discuss anemia as a pri- 
mary and a secondary condition. When anemia is sec- 
ondary the underlyingf disease must be treated and the 
diet prescribed to suit the demands of the primary 
disturbance. We cannot treat the anemia which ac- 
companies nephritis in the same way as we treat the 
anemia of acute articular rheumatism ; in nephritis the 
very nature of the disease imposes limitations beyond 
which we dare not trespass in any effort to increase 
the blood (see page 105) ; in rheumatism no such bar- 
rier to our progress exists. Where we can prescribe 
for the anemia itself we order a well balanced full diet 
in which protein and the fresh vegetables and fruits 
play an important role. The medicinal use of iron or 
of arsenic usually indicated can be supplemented by 
the foods richer in iron. 

The iron content of some foods can be seen from 
the two tables given below.

But as we have already freely discussed under tuber- 
culosis, in giving a full diet we must consider the 
patient's stomach and intestines. A full diet given 
to a stomach unable to digest it is of no avail to the 
patient, and for that reason any special condition of 
the stomach or intestine should be looked for and 
treated. 



PRIMARY PERNICIOUS ANEMIA 

In treating pernicious anemia it must be' borne in 
mind that often the disease is accompanied by an ab- 
sence of gastric juice and by symptoms of intestinal 
indigestion. For these reasons diet forms an impor- 
tant part of treatment, but owing to the accompany- 
ing gastro-intestinal disturbances it can not always be 
-directed to the anemia. The patient whose stomach 
rebels at meat should not be. told to eat raw beef, no 



ANEMIA, SCURVY AND GOITRE. 26 1 

matter how much theoretical good can be obtained 
from raw beef; nor should the carbohydrates be 
forced on another patient if they produce flatulence 
and discomfort. When a patient with pernicious 
anemia is in the remission stage, that is when the dis- 
ease may be said to be active and acute, the food prob- 
lem is to give him as nourishing a diet as he will eat 
and digest. If he can eat a full diet so much the bet- 
ter, but if he has achylia gastrica we must feed him for 
the stomach condition. 

Piet for Achylia Gastrica. 

Soups: Meat soups and cream soups. 

Meats: Finely divided beef, lamb and chicken. 

Vegetables: Strained peas, carrots, spinach, cauli-

Breads: Toast, zweibach and crackers. 

Beverages: Weak tea or coffee, occasionally cocoa, 
milk, vichy, buttermilk and fruitades. 

Cereals: Strained cereals of all kinds. 

Bggs: Soft-cooked, poached or boiled. 

Pats: Butter, cream in moderate amounts. 

Then as soon as improvement begins to be mani- 
fest the quantity and quality of the food must be 
changed; and in arriving at a full diet special atten- 
tion should be paid to the value of the animal proteins 
as blood producers. In a diet for anemia, either sec-

ondary or primary, more protein than is usually em 
bodied in a normal diet should be prescribed.

264 5*000 FOR THE SIQK. 

SCURVY 

Scurvy is a disease due to the absence in the food 
of certain elements found in fresh fruits, vegetables 
and meats. Formerly a common invader of camps 
and prisons, an unwelcome guest on long boat jour- 
neys, a dreaded accompaniment of exploring parties 
it has retreated before the advance of modern hygiene 
and preventive medicine and is a comparatively rare 
disease. Occasionally, however, it is still seen in in- 
fants improperly fed, or in adults whose diets for rea- 
sons of illness or ignorance have been poorly chosen. 
We have seen typical scurvy in a rich farmer whose 
meals consisted almost entirely of tea, biscuits and 
canned goods. The cure is complete when fresh vege- 
tables, fresh fruits and fresh meat are added to the 
diet. 

GOITRE 

Just a few words are necessary concerning the diet 
in goitre. In the simple enlargement of the thyroid 
gland so frequently seen in certain geographic loca- 
tions, as for instance along the Great' Lakes, not infre- 
quently a considerable reduction in the goitre will 
results from the rule "drink no water unless it is boiled 
or distilled." We know no special dietary indications 
for this condition. 

Exophthalmic goitre has been the subject of much 
metabolic study and the center of more dietary discus- 
sion. An increased metabolism has been proved as a 
fact, but the use of special forms of diet usually has 
been prompted by theory. In our experience we have 



ANEMIA, SCURVY AND GOITRE. 265 

not satisfied ourselves that any particular form of food 
was either distinctly beneficial or distinctly harmful, 
and we have merely advised a plentiful diet. DuBois 
in the most recent metabolic study of this disease has 
shown that ■ an exophthalmic goitre patient requires 
from ij^ to 2 times as much food as a normal person. 
He was unable to show a particularly beneficial effect 
from any of the food elements. 

The theory has been advanced by some physicians 
that g-oitre may be benefited by a lacto-vegetarian diet. 
In this diet all flesh foods are prohibited and vege- 
tables and milk and eggs make up the diet. We have 
no evidence of benefit derived from this diet, but in 
some cases it may be beneficial and worthy of a trial.

The second portion of the book is devoted to special gynecologic disease 
and is arranged particularly for the convenience of medical students. The first 
two parts (covering 500 pages) are entirely non-surgical, giving only drug and 
mechanical therapy and material invaluable to the general practitioner. The 
third partis exclusively a treatise on surgical gynecology,?caA includes profusely 
illustrated descriptions of those gynecologic operations that to the author seem 
most feasible. A number of new operations are given. Published May, 1916

DeLee's 
New Obstetrics 

Text-Book of Obstetrics. By Joseph B. DeLee, M. D., 
Professor of Obstetrics at Ndrthwestem University Medical 
School, Chicago. Large octavo of 1087 pages, with 938 illus- 
trations, 1 75 in colors. Cloth, |8. 00 net ; Half Morocco, 

%^-^0 net. Published August, 1915 

SECOND EDITION 

You will pronounce this new book the most elaborate, the most superbly 
illustrated work on Obstetrics you have ever seen. Especially will you value 
the 938 illustrations, all, with but few exceptions, original, and the best work 
of leading medical artists. Some 17$ of these illustrations are in color. 
Such a magniiicent collection of obstetric pictures — and with really practical 
vatue — has never before appeared in one book. 

You will find the text extremely practical throughout Diagnosis is fea- 
tnred, and the relations of obstetric conditions and accidents to general medi- 
cine, surgery, and the specialties are brought into prominence. 

Regarding Treatment: You get here the very latest advances in this field, 
and you can rest assured every method of treatment, every step in operative 
technic, is just right. Dr. DeLee' s twenty-one years' experience as a teacher 
and obstetrician guarantees this. 

Worthy of your particular attention are the descriptive legends under the 
illustrations. These are unusually full, and by studying the pictures serially 
with their detailed legends you are better able to follow the operations than 
by referring to the pictures from a distant text — the usual method. 

Prof. W. Stoeckel, Kiel, Germany 

" Dr. DeLee's Obstetrics deserves the greatest recognition. The whole work is of 
such sterling character through and through that it must b'e ranked with the best works of 
our literature."

INCLUDING SURGERY OF NEWBORN 

Dr. Davis' new work on Operative Obstetrics is a most practical one, and 
no expense has been spared to make it the handsomest work on the subject 
as well. Every step in every operation is described minutely, and the technic 
shown by beautiful new illustrations. The section given over to surgery of 
the newborn you will find unusually valuable. It .gives you much informa- 
tion you want to' know — facts you can use in your work every day. There 
is an excellent chapter on anesthesia in obstetrics. 

The Lancet, London 

" The best and most interesting part of the book is the summary of results given at the 
end oi the chapters and compiled from the author's own experience and from the literature."

Ashton's 
Practice of Gynecology 

SIXTH EDITION— publiihed October, 1916 

The Practice of Gynecology. By W. Easterly Ashton, 
M.D., LL.D., Professor of Gynecology at the Medico-Chirurgical 
College, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Pennsyl- 
vania. Octavo of 1097 pages, containing 1052 original line- 
drawings. Cloth, ^6.50 net; Half Morocco, |!8.oo net. 

Among the important new matter may be mentioned the De Keating- Hart 
fulguration treatment, Coley's mixed toxins for sarcoma of the genito-urinaiy 
organs, the cutireaction of von Pirquet in the diagnosis of tuberculosis, " 606 " 
for syphilis, the hormone theory, the Fowler-Murphy treatment of suppurative 
peritonitis, tincture of iodin in sterilization, and Baldy's new round ligament 
operation for retrodisplacement. Nothing is left to be taken for granted, the 
author not only telling his readers in every instance what should be done, but 
also precisely how to do it. A distinctly original feature of the book is the 
illustrations, numbering 1058 line drawings made eapecially under the author's 
personal supervision. 

From its first appearance Dr. Ashton's book set a standard in practical 
medical books ; that he has produced a work of unusual value to the medical 
practitioner is shown by the demand for new editions. 

Howard A. Kelly. M. D., 

Professor of Gynecologic Surgery ^ yohns Hopkins University 

"It is different Irom anything that has as yet appeared. The illustrations are particu- 
larly clear and satisfactory. One specially g-ond feature is the pains with which you 
describe so many details so often left to the imagination." 

Charles B. Penrose, M. D., 

Formerly Professor of Gynecology ^ University of Pennsylvania. 

" I know of no book that goes so thoroughly and satisfactorily into all the details of 
•verything connected with the subject. In this respect your book differs from the others." 

George M. Edebohls. M.D. 

Professor of Diseases of fVomen, New York Post- Graduate Medical School, 
" I have looked it through and must congratulate you upon having produced a text- 
book most admirably adapted to teach gynecology to those who must get their knowledge, 
even to the minutest and most elementary details, from books."

Bandler's 
Medical Gynecology 



Medical Gynecology. By S. VVyllis Bandler, M. D., 
Adjunct Professor of Diseases of Women, New York Post- 
Graduate Medical School and Hospital. Octavo of 790 pages, 
with 150 original illustrations. Cloth, ^5.00 net; Half Morocco, 

*6 CO net. Published February, 1914 

THIRD EDITION— 60 PAGES ON INTERNAL SECRETIONS 

This new work by Dr. Bandler is just the book that the physician en- 
gaged in general practice has long needed. It is truly the practitioner' s gyne^ 
cology — planned for him, written for him, and illustrated for him. There are 
many gynecologic conditions that do not call for operative treatment ; yet, 
because of lack of that special knowledge required for their diagnosis and 
treatment, the general practitioner has been unable to treat them intelligently. 
This work gives just the information the practitioner needs. 
American Journal of Obstetrics 

*' He has shown good judgment in the selection of his data. He has placed most 
emphasis on diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. He has presented his facts in a manner 
to be readily grasped by the general practitioner." 



Bandler's Vaginal Celiotomy 

Vaginal Celiotomy. By S. Wyllis Bandler, M. D. Octavo 
of 450' pages, with 148 illustrations. Cloth, ^5.00 net. 

SUPERB ILLUSTRATIONS 

The vaginal route, because of its simplicity, ease of execution, absence of 
shock, moie certain results, and the opportunity for conservative measures, 
constitutes a field which should appeal to all- surgeons, gynecologists, and 
obstetricians. Posterior vaginal celiotomy is of great importance in the re- 
moval of small tubal and ovarian tumors and cysts, and is an important step 
in the performance of vaginal myomectomy, hysterectomy, and hystero- 
myomectomy. Anterior vaginal celiotomy with thorough separation of f'/e 
bladder is the only certain method of correcting cystocele. January, 1911 

The Lancet, London 

" Dr. Bandler has done good service in writing this book- which gives a very clear 
description of all the operations which may be undertaken through the vagina. He makes 
out a strong case for these operations."

Hirst's Obtetrics 

New (8th) Edition 

A Text-Book of Obstetrics. By Barton Cooke Hirst, 
M. D., Professor of Obstetrics in the University of Pennsylania. 
Handsome octavo, 875 pages, with 700 illustrations. Ready 
in October, 1917. 



The revision of the work for this edition was so thorough and complete that 
the book had to be entirely reset. Nothing has been omitted that could make 
this work a practical, valuable text-book embracing all the modern advances 
in the field. Among the new subjects included are the use of Dakin's solu- 
tion and of the sunlight and open-air treatment of puerperal infections, a new 
chapter on various anesthesias in obstetrics, and another on the repair of in- 
juries of the genital tract due to childbirth. The illustrations form one of the 
features of the book. They are numerous and most of them are original. 

British Medical Journal 

<< The illustrations in Dr. Hirst's volume are far more numerous and far better exe* 
cuted, and therefore more instructive, than those commonly found in the works of writera 
on obstetrics in our own country."

SECOND EDITION 

As diagnosis and treatment are of the greatest importance in considering 
diseases of women, particular attention has been devoted to these divisions. 
The palliative treatment, as w6ll as the radical operation, is fully described, 
enabling the general practitioner to treat many of his own patients without 
referring them to a specialist. Published August, 1905 

Medical Record, New York 

" Its merits can he appreciated only by a careful perusal. , . Nearly one hundred 
pa^es are devoted to technic, this chapter being in some respects superior to the descrtp*

WITH 880 ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIONS BY HERMANN BECKER 
AND MAX BRODEL 

In view of the intimate association of gynecology with abdominal surgery 
the editors have combined these two important subjects in one work. For 
this reason the work will be doubly valuable, for not only the gynecologist and 
general practitioner will find it an exhaustive treatise, but the surgeon also will 
find here the latest technic of the various abdominal operations. It possesses 
a number of valuable features not to be found in any other publication cover- 
ing the same fields. It contains a chapter upon the bacteriology and one upon 
the pathology of gynecology, dealing fully with tlie scientific basis of gyne- 
cology. In no other work can this information, prepared by specialists, be 
found as separate chapters. There is a large chapter devoted entirely to 
medical gynecology, written especially for the physician engaged in general 
practice. Heretofore the general practitioner was compelled to search through 
an entire work in order to obtain the information desired. Ahdo?ninal sur- 
gery proper, as distinct from gynecology, is fully treated, embracing operations 
upon the stomach, upon the intestines, upon the liver and bile-ducts, upon the 
pancreas and spleen, upon the kidney, ureter, bladder, and the peritoneum. 
Special attention has been given to modern technic. The illustrations are the 
work of Mr. Hermann Becker and Mr. Max Brodel.

" It is needless to say that the work has been thoroughly done : the names of fhe autliors 
and editors would guarantee this ; but much may be said in praise of the method of presen- 
tation, and attention mav be called to the inclusion of matter not to be found elsewhere."

FOR THE PRACTITIONER 

Dr. Webster has written this work especially for the general practitioner^ 
discussing the clinical features of the subject in their widest relations to 
general practice rather than from the standpoint of specialism. The magni- 
ficent illustrations, three hundred and seventy-two in number, are nearly all 
original. Drawn by expert anatomic artists under Dr. Webster' s direct super- 
vision, they portray the anatomy of the parts and the steps in the operations 
with rare clearness and exactness. Published January, 1907 

Howard A. Kelly* M.D.» Pro/essoro/Gynecolog;icSuig<;ry,Ji3hnsHopkinsUniversity, 

*' It is undoubtedly one of the best works which has been put on the market within 
recent years, showing from start to finish Dr. Webster's well-knowp thoroughness. The 
illustrations are also of the highest order."

A MASTER WORK 
ILLUSTRATED BY AUGUST HORN AND HERMANN BECKER 

This monumental worU, the fruit of over ten years of untiring labors, will 
remain for many years the last word upon the subject. Written by those men 
who have brought, step by step, the operative treatment of uterine rayoma to 
such perfection that the mortality is now less than one per cent., it stands out 
as the record of greatest achievement of recent limes. 

The illustrations have been made with wonderful accuracy in detail by Mr. 
August Horn and Mr. Hennann Becker, whose superb work is so Avell known 
that comment is unnecessary. For painstakmg accuracy, for attention to every 
detail, and as an example of the practical results accruing from the associa- 
tion of the operating amphitheater with the pathologic laboratory, this work 
will stand as an enduring testimonial. Published May, 1909

well illustrated, so practical, and so far reaching in their teaching to general practitioner,

ACCURATE 

Regularly every year a new edition of this excellent text-book is called

trammeled by antiquated ideas and methods. In every case the most modern 
and progressive technique is adopted, and the main points are made clear by 
excellent illustrations.

FOURTH EDITION 

While Dr. DeLee has written his work especially for nurses, the practi- 
tioner will also find it useful and instructive, since the duties of a nurse often 
devolve upon him in the early years of his practice. The illustrations are 
nearly all original and represent pliotographs taken from actual scenes. The 
text is the result of the author' s many years' experience in lecturing to the 
nurses of five different training schools.
