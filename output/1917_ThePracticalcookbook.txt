PREFACE 

This book presents a rather large collection of tested and 
economical recipes, in such a manner as to show their relation 
to one another and to the whole question of balanced meals. 
The plan of the book is novel, but it is hoped that it will the 
more commend itself to the public for that very reason. It is 
absolutely essential that the General Directions which accom- 
pany each group of recipes should be read and followed ; also 
that the references should be carefully traced. If the house- 
keeper calculates the cost of each dish as she prepares it, the 
columns headed Price will serve as a reasonably accurate 
guide to the cost of her daily meals. 

The book has grown out of many years of classroom work, 
and the arrangement is designed, by omitting all unnecessary 
directions, to force the student to reason out the recipes for 
herself. But it is a cookbook, not a textbook, and laboratory 
directions and explanatory text are purposely omitted. 

In preparing the book, the bulletins of the United States 
Department of Agriculture, magazines dealing with the sub- 
ject of food, and many standard works on dietetics and the 
preparation of food have been freely consulted. 

The author wishes to express her gratitude to the many 
friends who have allowed her to use their original recipes, as 
well as to those who have read and criticized the manuscript.

THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 



INTRODUCTION 

Food is anything which, taken into the body, rebuilds the 
tissues, yields heat and energy, or aids in body processes. 
All foods contain one or more chemical compounds, and the 
amounts of those compounds furnish a means of classifying 
foods, as follows : ( i ) Proteids, containing nitrogen, supply 
tissue-building materials and yield heat and energy, but, as they 
alone can build tissue, should not be depended upon as heat- 
givers. (2) Starch and sugar (carbohydrates) yield energy and 
heat, because they contain carbon. (3) Fats and oils (hydro- 
carbons) give a larger amount of heat, but are less valuable as 
proteid-sparers and, like starch and sugar, may be stored as fat 
in the body. (4) Mineral salts aid largely in forming bones, 
teeth, hair, and nails, and assist in the processes of digestion, 
assimilation, metabolism, circulation, respiration, etc. (5) Water 
is necessary to support life, carry away waste, soften food for 
digestion, and, by evaporation, keep the body at its normal 
temperature. 

Food is cooked to destroy any germs it may contain and 
to render it more palatable, more digestible, or both. 

Cooking is the preparation of food by the aid of heat. The 
common methods of cooking are (1) with water, as boiling, 
steaming, simmering, and stewing ; (2) in the oven, as roast- 
ing or baking; (3) by direct heat, as broiling; (4) with fat, 
as frying or sauteing. 

Careful and accurate measurements are necessary for good 
results in cooking. Cups which are to be filled with liquid 



2 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

should be placed on a plate to avoid spilling. To fill a cup 
with any dry material, put the food into the cup by the spoon- 
ful until heaping full, and then level with the back of a case 
knife. Butter should be packed into the cup (or spoon) with 
a knife, then leveled. 

To measure dry material by the spoonful, dip in the spoon, 
fill full, then level as above. A half spoonful should be 
measured as above, then divided lengthwise into halves. 

Measure acid substances with agate or glass cups and stir 
with a wooden or silver spoon. 

Sift powdered sugar, flour, meal, etc. before and after 
measuring. If materials are all prepared and measured before 
beginning to mix the ingredients, much time and confusion 
may be saved. Study the recipes carefully, and if several cook- 
ing processes are involved, attend first to that which requires 
the most time. When more than one material is to be pre- 
pared, begin with that which will be least harmed by standing ; 
for example, when celery and apples are to be used as a salad, 
the celery should be cut up first, as the apples will discolor if 
exposed to the air. 

Use as few utensils as possible in your work, and as soon 
as you have finished using them, arrange them neatly for 
washing. Bowls, etc., which have contained eggs, starchy 
mixtures, cereals, or milk, should be soaked in cold water ; 
hot water should be used for anything which has held sugar. 
Greasy dishes should first be wiped with clean, soft paper 
(which should be burned), and then soaked in hot, soapy water.

THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 



Stuffed prunes. Cook as for Stewed primes (p. 7). When 
fruit is soft, remove the stones carefully, place half a walnut in 
each cavity, and roll prune firmly round it. Place fruit, when 
prepared, in a serving-dish and pour over it the sirup left from 
cooking the prunes. The sirup should be rather sweet. Serve 
with cream (plain or whipped). 

Stuffed dates. Dates will not require soaking, but should 
be washed and dried thoroughly. Remove the stones with a 
sharp knife and refill the dates with nuts, crystallized ginger, 
fondant, peanut butter, or cream cheese, made into small rolls 
after seasoning with a little salt and paprika. When nuts, 
ginger, or fondant are used, roll the dates in powdered sugar 
and serve as a confection. Cheese dates or nut-butter dates 
may be served with a salad or after dinner with crackers.

MINERAL SALTS 9 

General Directions. Fruit should be kept in a cool place 
and should be thoroughly washed before being used for the 
table or for cooking. All decayed portions should be carefully 
removed. Apples must be pared, except for baking ; cran- 
berries should be picked over thoroughly ; grapefruit should 
be cut in halves, the seeds removed, and the pulp separated 
from the tough membrane ; pineapples should be pared, the 
eyes removed with a sharp knife, and the fruit shredded with 
a silver fork ; bananas should be peeled and scraped ; oranges 
for slicing should be pared with a sharp knife in order to re- 
move the thin as well as the thick skin, and sliced so that the 
core will not be included ; lemons should be cut crosswise, not 
from stem to blossom end ; rhubarb, when young and tender, 
should not be peeled, as the red skin gives an attractive color 
to the sauce. 

Baked apples. Pare and core apples (or, if it is desired 
to retain the color, do not pare) ; put in a buttered baking- 
dish, fill centers with sugar and spice mixed, pour the water 
around them, and bake in a moderate oven until soft, basting 
occasionally. The dish should be covered. 

Stuffed apples. Additional ingredients : 4 tb. raisins, 2 tb. 
chopped nuts. Mix these with the sugar, which may be either 
brown or white, and proceed as above. Serve with whipped 
cream. 

Glazed apples. Boil sugar and water gently for 5 min. 
Quarter and core the apples ; put \ the pieces into the sirup, 
removing when soft ; put in the remainder of the apples and 
cook in the same way. When all are cooked, strain sirup over 
them. Lemon rind, thinly pared, may be cooked in the sirup 
if the apples are not sour, or a bit of stick cinnamon or ginger 
root may be added. 

Apple sauce. Quarter the apples and cook with the water 
until soft enough to rub through a strainer, adding sugar and 
spice about 10 min. before removing from fire. If sauce is 
desired unstrained, core the apples before cooking. 



10 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Cranberry sauce. Add sugar and water to berries ; cover 
and boil 10 min. Strain if desired. 

Cranberry jelly. Cook berries with the water for 15 min. 
Strain, rubbing as much as possible through sieve, add sugar, 
cook 5 min., and pour into a mold or glasses. 

Baked bananas. Cut bananas in quarters, lengthwise, and 
place in a buttered baking-dish. Mix sugar and lemon juice, 
adding 1 tb. melted butter if desired ; spread this mixture over 
the fruit and bake in a slow oven till bananas are soft, basting 
with the juice at least once. May be served with whipped 
cream or as a vegetable. 

Fruit macedoine. Oranges, grapefruit, bananas, pineapples, 
peaches, and strawberries may be used, combining two or 
more kinds. Fruit should be prepared according to General 
Directions, then mixed with the sugar and lemon juice 
and chilled before serving. May be used as a dessert, or, 
under name of " fruit cocktail," as the first course for a 
formal luncheon. 

Fruit punch. Use juice of fruit only. A good combination 
is made by using 1 lemon, 1 orange, and -|- c. grape juice or 
i c. strong tea. Boil sugar and water, then add the fruit juice. 
It is better to chill the punch than to add ice to it. 

Rhubarb sauce. Cut rhubarb into inch lengths and put into 
an agate or porcelain-lined saucepan with just enough water 
to cover bottom. Cook until soft and sweeten to taste. May 
also be baked until soft. 

VEGETABLES 

Winter Vegetables 

Source. Roots, tubers, stems, leaves, bulbs, fruit, or flowers 
of various plants. 

Food Value. Principally for mineral salts, acids, and crude 
fiber. Some contain starch. 

Cost. See market prices.

General Directions. All vegetables should be thoroughly 
washed, prepared according to kind, and, if necessary, fresh- 
ened by standing in cold water for an hour or more before 
cooking. Then cook in enough freshly boiling salted water to 
cover the food. When soft enough to pierce easily with a fork, 
drain very dry and season. Strong-flavored vegetables should 
be cooked in an uncovered kettle. 

Buttered carrots. Scrape carrots and cook i to 2 hr. Slice 
or cut in strips either before or after cooking. Add required 
seasonings or serve in i c. white sauce. 

Buttered parsnips. Same as for Buttered carrots (above). 
May be cut in quarters, lengthwise, and browned in hot butter 
or drippings. 

Mashed turnips. Pare turnips and cut in quarters. Cook 
about i hr. After cooking, mash and add required seasonings. 
May be cut in cubes before cooking and served in a white 
sauce. 

Stewed celery. Scrape celery and cut in inch lengths. Cook 
\ hr. Add required seasonings or serve in i * c. white sauce. 

Buttered beets. Cook beets 3 to 5 hr. Peel and slice after 
cooking and season as required, or chop fine and reheat with 
the seasonings, adding 1 tb. butter. 



12 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Pickled beets. Cover cold cooked beets with vinegar, add- 
ing a bit of bay leaf and a few cloves and peppercorns. 

Boiled onions. Peel under water and let stand 1 to I hr. 
in cold water to which a little cooking-soda has been added. 
Drain and add fresh water at least twice while cooking. Cook

Stuffed peppers. Additional ingredients: 4 tb. chopped 
meat or 6 tb. grated cheese. 1 tsp. scraped onion may be 
used with meat. Remove stem end and seeds from the peppers 
and parboil 10 min. Drain thoroughly, turning upside down 
to dry, and fill with a stuffing made from the stale bread 
crumbs and the seasonings, adding enough boiling water to 
moisten well. Bake 25 to 30 min. in a moderate oven and 
serve with or without toast and Broxvn sauce (p. 30). 

Eggplant. Wash eggplant and cut in l-inch slices. Pare, 
pile slices together with plenty of salt between them, cover 
with a plate and weight, and let stand several hours. Drain, 
wash well in cold water, and dry. Dip in batter or in egg and

Melt butter and add to it the crumbs, which should be fine and 
dry. Place tomatoes in a buttered baking-dish in two layers ; 
sprinkle with salt, pepper, and crumbs, with more crumbs on top 
than between the layers. Bake 35 to 45 min. in a moderate oven. 

Stuffed tomatoes. Instead of peeling and slicing the toma- 
toes, a small section may be removed from the center and the 
crumbs and seasonings used for a stuffing, as for peppers. 



MINERAL SALTS 15 

Baked tomatoes. Additional ingredient : 2 tb. chopped 
green pepper. Cut tomatoes in halves and place, skin side

boiling water with ^ tb. salt and boil until they can be pierced 
easily with a fork. Drain thoroughly, return to saucepan, sprinkle 
with salt, and set on back of stove till dry and mealy. Do not 
cover, as that keeps in the steam and makes the potatoes moist. 

Mashed potatoes. Prepare potatoes and cook like Boiled po- 
tatoes. When dry and mealy, mash thoroughly in saucepan used 
for cooking them, add other ingredients, beat well with a fork, 
and when light and creamy set in a hot place until ready to serve,

Drain, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and flour, place in a pan with 
meat that is being roasted, and cook till potatoes are soft, 
basting occasionally with the drippings. 

Creamed potatoes. Prepare potatoes ; make a white sauce 
of other ingredients and heat potatoes in this. 

Scalloped potatoes. Make a white sauce of the necessary in- 
gredients, put potatoes into a buttered baking-dish or ramekins, 



STARCH 21 

pour sauce over them, sprinkle with buttered crumbs (3 tb. 
melted butter to 1 c. crumbs), and bake until crumbs are 
brown. 1 c. cold cooked meat, fish, or eggs, with or without

24 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

General Directions. Pick over rice, put in strainer, and set in 
bowl of cold water. Wash between hands, draining and renew- 
ing water three times. 

Steamed rice. Wash rice as above, put in double boiler 
with salt and water, and cook until kernels are soft. Add more 
water if needed. Uncover to let steam escape before serving. 
Use as a vegetable, or mold in cups for a pudding and serve 
with stewed figs. For variety place half an apricot, peach, or 
steamed apple in bottom of cup and serve with Soft custard 
(p. 66). 

Boiled rice. Wash rice and cook in rapidly boiling salted 
water until kernels are soft. Drain thoroughly and set pan on 
back of stove to dry. This method wastes a little of the nour- 
ishment, but the kernels of rice are more distinct than when 
steamed. The rice water may be saved to use in tomato soup. 

Rice and cheese. Prepare Boiled rice (above) ; add to it the 
white sauce and cheese, chopped fine. Serve plain as a supper 
dish, or put in ramekins, cover with buttered crumbs (\\ tb. 
melted butter to \ c. fine crumbs), and bake until brown. 

Hominy and cheese may be prepared like Rice and cheese, 
using cooked hominy instead of rice. 

Rice and tomato. Method I. Prepare Steamed rice (above), 
using 2 c. water, and when the water is almost absorbed, add 
tomato. When rice is cooked, season and serve as a vegetable. 
May be baked like Rice and cheese (above). 

Method 2. Additional ingredient: 2 tb. flour. Boil rice as 
for Boiled rice (above), and just before serving add I c. tomato 
sauce made from remaining ingredients. See directions for 
Tomato sauce (p. 31). 

Hominy and tomato may be made by substituting cooked 
hominy for the rice in Method 2. 

Rice with salmon. Additional ingredients : 1-pound can 
salmon, 1 c. peas. Cook the rice as for Steamed rice (above), 
and just before serving add the seasoning and mix in lightly 
the salmon (flaked) and the peas.

General Directions. Milk must be scalded and other liquids 
hot, except in White sauce, Method 2. The kind of stock to 
be used is indicated by the name of the recipe. Use bread 
flour for thickening. 

Drawn-butter sauce. Mix flour with salt and pepper. Melt 
butter, stir in flour, then add water, i at a time. Boil sauce 
with every addition of water, beating each time until smooth. 



30 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Parsley sauce. Add I tb. chopped parsley to Drawn-butter 
sauce. 

Egg sauce. Add I hard-cooked egg, sliced, to Drawn-hitter 
sauce. 

White sauce (thin, medium, or thick). These sauces vary 
in thickness, and any one of them may be made by any of the 
following methods and used according to individual preference 
wherever a recipe, calls for white sauce. 

Method I. Melt butter in a saucepan and stir in the flour 
without removing the saucepan from the stove. Add l of the 
milk, stir until the mixture boils, then beat until the sauce is 
perfectly smooth ; add another third of the milk and repeat the 
stirring and beating ; then add remainder of milk, and when 
the sauce boils, season as required. This method develops the 
flavor of the sauce better than Method 2 and Method J. 

Method 2. Melt butter in a double boiler, stir in the flour. 
then add the milk (cold). Stir constantly till sauce thickens. 
Add seasonings. 

Method J. Scald | c. milk and mix the flour with remain- 
der of the milk before adding hot liquid. Cook at least 
15 min. in double boiler, stirring until thick. Butter and 
seasoning should be added last. This method of making is 
considered better for those of weak digestion. 

Mock hollandaise sauce. Make like White sauce (medium), 
Method I, using 2 tb. butter instead of 1 tb. Just before 
removing from fire add yolk of 1 egg mixed with a little of 
the sauce, and when ready to serve, stir in 1 tb. lemon juice. 

Cheese sauce. Add to White sauce (medium), Method 2, 
i c. chopped cheese and stir until melted. 

Brown sauce. Butter and onion should be cooked 5 min., 
then flour added and browned ; add liquid l at a time, as for 
White sauce, Method I. Onion may be omitted if desired, 
and 1 tsp. vinegar, catsup, or Worcestershire sauce added. 

Sauce piquante . Add to Brown sauce 1 tb. chopped cucumber 
pickles, 1 tb. vinegar, 1 tsp. walnut catsup, and 1 tsp. capers. 



STARCH 



31 



Tomato sauce. Make like Brown sauce (p. 30), but do not 
allow butter to brown. 

Tomato cream sauce. Additional ingredient: -^g tsp. soda. 
Add the soda to the hot tomato stock, and when bubbling 
ceases, stir the tomato, a little at a time, into a white sauce 
made from the remaining ingredients. 



Yeast Bread and Rolls 

Source. Universal. Made from cereals, ground into meal or 
flour ; their use in some form extends through the civilized 
world. 

Food Value. Largely for starch, but contain considerable pro- 
tein, and when served with butter provide a well-balanced food. 

Cost. 

Yeast cake, 2 $. 5-cent loaf = 20 to 24 slices 

Bread, 5 per loaf. 5-cent loaf =50. crumbs. 

Yeast. A microscopic plant, always present in the air. 
Grows and multiplies rapidly in a warm, moist, sweet, nitroge- 
nous soil. Given these, as in bread, its presence causes some 
of the starch to be changed to sugar and then into alcohol and 
carbon dioxide. These, in their attempt to escape, cause the 
dough to rise.

32 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

General Directions. Amounts of flour given should be used 
cautiously, as different brands vary greatly. For all these recipes 
the yeast should be dissolved in lukewarm water (i yeast cake 
to \ c.) before using. Pour hot liquid over butter, sugar, and 
salt. Add yeast to the above mixture when it is lukewarm. 
For Water bread and Milk bread add enough flour to knead. 
For Graham bread and Whole-zvheat bread all the flour should 
be added and the whole well beaten. Set in a warm place, cover- 
ing the bowl well, and let stand 8 or 10 hr., or until double 
its bulk. Knead for a second time, then shape the dough or, 
for Graham bi'ead and Whole-wheat bread, beat well. Fill 
pans \ full, let rise until twice its original size, and bake in a 
moderate oven until it is light and well browned and there is 
no crackling in the loaf (45 to 75 min.). 

Water bread. Will make 2 loaves or 2 pans of biscuits. 
Use only enough flour to make a dough that can be handled 
easily, and knead until smooth and elastic. 

Milk bread. See Water bread (above). Half water and half 
milk may be used in place of 2 c. milk. 

Graham bread. Will make 1 loaf. Should rise in pans until 
a little less than twice original size. 

Whole- wheat bread. Proceed as for Graham bread (above). 

Rolled-oats bread. Additional ingredients : \ c. molasses, 
1 c. rolled oats. Add boiling water to rolled oats, let stand \ hr., 
and add other ingredients ; let rise overnight, beat thoroughly, 
turn into buttered bread-pans ; let rise again, and bake. 

Raised flour muffins. Additional ingredient : 1 egg. Add 
butter, sugar, and salt to hot milk ; when lukewarm add yeast 
cake to this mixture, then egg (well beaten) and flour. Beat 
thoroughly, cover, and let rise overnight. In the morning fill 
buttered gem-pans f full, let rise till pans are full, and bake 
30 min. in moderate oven. 

Oatmeal muffins. Additional ingredient: \ c. cold cooked 
oatmeal. Mix the hot milk with the oatmeal and proceed as 
for Raised flour muffins (above), omitting the egg. 



STARCH 33 

Parker House rolls I. Put milk, butter, sugar, and salt into 
a mixing-bowl. When lukewarm add yeast and 3 c. flour. 
Beat well, cover, and let rise till light. Add enough more 
flour to make dough stiff enough to knead, and let rise again. 
When double its bulk, knead again, roll out, shape, and let 
rise till light in buttered pan. Bake in hot oven 12 to 15 min. 
If made overnight, ^ yeast cake is enough. 

Luncheon rolls. Additional ingredients : I egg, I tb. lard, 

1 tsp. grated lemon rind. Add sugar, salt, and shortening to 
milk. When lukewarm add yeast and 1 c. flour. Cover and let 
rise ; then add egg, lemon rind, and enough flour to knead, and 
let rise again. Roll A in. thick, shape with biscuit-cutter, place 
in buttered pan ; let rise again, and bake. 

Coffee rolls. Additional ingredients : 1 egg, ^ c. raisins 
(cut fine). Pour the hot milk over the butter, sugar, and salt. 
When lukewarm add the yeast, raisins, egg (well beaten), and 
flour enough to knead. Knead till smooth and elastic and let 
rise overnight. Roll out in a thin sheet, brush with melted 
butter, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and roll like a jelly 
roll. Cut in small slices, place close together in a buttered 
baking-pan, let rise till double their bulk, and bake about 
30 min. in a hot oven. The process may be completed in a 
day if 1 yeast cake is used. The dough may be spread in a 
large pan, brushed over with 1 egg, and, after rising, may be 
covered with the following mixture : 3 tb. butter, 2 tb. sugar, 

2 tb. flour, 1 tsp. cinnamon. When baked it should be broken 
into small squares. 

Buns. Additional ingredient : \ c. raisins (stoned and quar- 
tered). Add the sugar, salt, and butter to the milk ; when luke- 
warm add yeast and lie. flour ; cover and let rise till light ; 
then add raisins and flour to make a soft dough. Let rise, 
shape like biscuit ; let rise again, and bake. May be glazed by 
brushing with egg before baking. 

Breadsticks. Additional ingredient: white of I egg. Add 
butter, sugar, and salt to milk ; when lukewarm add yeast, egg

General Directions. For toast, cut bread in slices of uniform 
thickness, put into toaster, hold some distance from fire until 
dried through, then brown quickly on both sides. In a gas 
stove bread may be put into large baking-pan in broiling-oven, 
but must be carefully watched and turned. (Old pieces of bread 
may be dried, rolled, sifted, and kept in jars to use for frying 
or scalloped dishes. Cover with cheesecloth.) 

Plain toast. Toast bread ; butter, and send to table at once. 

Hot-water toast. Toast bread ; put butter and salt in a 
shallow dish, pour over them the boiling water, dip each slice 
quickly in this, using a knife and fork. Send to table hot, with 
slices piled on top of each other. 

Cream toast. Toast bread ; make a white sauce of remain- 
ing ingredients ; dip each slice of toast into this, put in a 



STARCH 35 

covered dish, and strain the rest of the sauce over the toast. 
Toast may be buttered before dipping. 

Egg toast. Beat egg, add sugar, salt, and milk. Dip slices 
of bread separately into this mixture, and when all have been 
softened, brown on both sides on a hot, well-greased griddle 
or frying-pan. Use only enough fat to keep bread from 
sticking. Serve for breakfast or lunch or, with a sweet sauce, 
for dessert. 

Cheese sandwiches may be made by the following recipe : 
Omit sugar, and after browning toast lay thin slices of cheese 
between 2 slices of toast, sprinkle with salt and paprika, and 
place in oven till cheese is melted. 

Tomato cream toast. Additio7ial ingredient: \ tsp. soda. 
Heat tomato, add soda, stir, and strain. Add this to sauce 
made from other ingredients, season, and proceed as for 
Cream toast (p. 34). Serve immediately. 

Croutons. Use stale bread and cut about f in. thick. Butter 
well, using softened or melted butter. Cut in strips -| in. wide, 
then cut these in cubes. Bake in a moderate oven till golden 
brown, shaking the pan occasionally. 

DncJicss crusts. Brown the strips of bread, making them 
A in. wide. Grated cheese may be spread on the crusts before 
baking. Season with cayenne pepper. 

Croustade cases. Cut slices of bread 2 in. thick. Stamp 
rounds from these with a cooky-cutter and scoop out the inside, 
leaving a shell. Brush over with melted butter and brown. 
Oblong cases may be made by dividing slices of bread in halves 
and scooping out the center. Fill with creamed vegetables, 
fish, or meat.

3 tb. melted butter. Put a few crumbs in bottom of a buttered 
baking-dish or ramekins, then put ^ the food used as a foundation 
(with seasonings), and repeat the process, reserving at least ^ 
the crumbs for the top layer. Milk or stock should be made 
into a sauce with the butter and flour and mixed with meat, 
fish, or vegetables. Bake about 20 min. in a moderate oven. 

Scalloped meat. Meat should be finely chopped and mixed 
with a brown sauce made of the other ingredients before putting 
into the dish with the crumbs. Stewed and strained tomato 
may be substituted for the stock ; or if chicken or veal be the

Make like Fruit bread pudding (p. 37), melting butter in the 
hot milk and adding beaten egg last. Flavor with vanilla or 
lemon. Serve with Hard sauce (p. 60) or Creamy sauce 
(p. 60). If a meringue is desired, use 2 eggs for the pud- 
ding and reserve the whites for the meringue. Omit sauce 
if a meringue is used. 

Queen of puddings. Soak bread crumbs in hot milk till 
soft and mash them. Add egg yolks and other ingredi-

When quite cold flavor with lemon juice and the grated lemon 
rind. Beat whites of eggs stiff, add the powdered sugar, heap 
lightly on the pudding, and serve at once. 

Berry pudding. Use blueberries, huckleberries, raspberries, 
or blackberries. (In winter canned berries may be used.) Stew 
the fruit with the sugar, adding a little water if necessary. 
Butter the bread, lay 2 slices in the bottom of a melon mold, 
cover with the hot fruit, and add remainder of the materials 
in layers. Chill thoroughly, remove from mold, and serve with 
whipped cream, sweetened and flavored. 

Hot berry pudding. Use same ingredients as for Bei'ry

General Directions. Dry ingredients should be sifted, the sugar 
with them except in Doughnuts. If eggs are not separated, 
they may be combined with milk after being beaten. Butter 
should be melted and added last, just before whites of eggs. To 
saute (brown on both sides in shallow fat) the first five mix- 
tures, use a heavy frying-pan, griddle, or waffle iron. Grease 
well with salt pork, drippings, or butter. If latter is used, re- 
move pan to back of stove when adding fresh fat, then reheat. 
Use only enough fat to keep food from sticking. For the dough- 
nuts and the fritters use lard, or any lard substitute ; butter is 
unsuitable. Put fat in a deep kettle, having plenty to cover the 
food. For full directions for frying see Frying (p. 99) and 
Croquettes (p. 99) and follow carefully. 

Buckwheat cakes. Additional ingredients : buckwheat flour 
should be used, also 4 tb. corn meal, 2 tb. molasses, \ tsp. soda. 



40 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Sift all dry ingredients except the soda. Add yeast dissolved in 
a little of the water, then the lukewarm water and molasses. 
Beat well, let rise overnight, and in the morning stir in the 
soda and beat well. Cook by the spoonful on a hot, well- 
greased griddle. 

Raised waffles. Mix like Raised flour muffins (p. 32), 
omitting the egg. When well risen add the egg and cook in 
a well-greased waffle iron till brown. Serve with butter and 
sugar or sirup. 

Plain waffles. Sift dry ingredients ; add milk to beaten 
egg yolks and combine the two mixtures. Then add the butter 
(melted) and the whites of eggs (beaten stiff). Cook and serve 
as for Raised waffles (above). 

Griddlecakes. Mix like Plain waffles (above) and cook by 
the spoonful on a hot, well-greased griddle. 2 c. sour milk and 
1 tsp. bicarbonate of soda may be substituted for the sweet milk 
and baking-powder. The eggs need not be separated and are 
sometimes omitted if sour milk is used. 

Bread griddlecakes. Additional ingredient: 2 c. soft bread 
crumbs. Scald milk and pour it over the bread crumbs. Let 
stand till cool and proceed as for Plain waffles (above). Cook 
on a griddle as for Griddlecakes (above). 

Doughnuts. Additional ingredient: \ tsp. spice (either 
nutmeg or cinnamon or a combination of both). Beat the eggs 
light without separating and add the sugar and the butter 
(melted) ; then add the milk and lastly the dry ingredients sifted 
together. More flour may be used to make the mixture stiff 
enough to roll out, but it should be kept as soft as possible. 
It will roll more easily if chilled on ice before handling. Divide 
into quarters and roll out one quarter at a time. Cut with a 
floured doughnut-cutter and fry in deep fat. Drain on brown 
paper. Stir the trimmings into the next quarter of dough and 
proceed as before till all dough is used. The fat should be hot 
enough to brown a bit of bread while counting 60. The dough- 
nuts may be sprinkled with sugar after being fried. 



STARCH 



41 



Corn fritters. Additional ingredients : 1 c. corn, A tsp. pa- 
prika. Use canned corn, or cold cooked corn cut from the cob ; 
chop it and add the milk. Stir in the dry ingredients and 
when well mixed add the eggs, well beaten. Drop by the 
spoonful into hot fat, and when brown drain on brown paper. 
Test the fat as for Doughnuts (p. 40). 

Com oysters. Make like Com fritters, omitting I egg and 
the milk and using i c. flour with less seasoning. Cook on a 
hot, well-greased griddle. 

Fruit fritters. Additional ingredient : 1 to I A c. fruit, cut 
in small pieces. Make a batter as for Griddlecakes (p. 40) ; stir 
the fruit into this and fry by the spoonful in hot fat. Bananas, 
apples, oranges, pears, or peaches may be used. Use bread 
flour.

General Directions. For all these mixtures containing sugar, 
the shortening should be creamed and the sugar added grad- 
ually. Add the egg (beaten) ; then add the milk and the sifted 
dry ingredients alternately. When sifting dry ingredients, re- 
serve part of flour in case all is not needed. The shortening 
may be all butter or a mixture of butter and lard or sweet 
drippings. Any preferred spice may be used and amounts 



48 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

varied to suit individual tastes. Molasses cookies may be made 
with all lard or drippings. Add only enough flour to make the 
dough stiff enough to handle ; too much will make the cookies 
tough and hard. Roll out only a small portion at a time and 
keep the remainder cool till ready to use. Add the trimmings 
to a fresh portion of the dough. For thin cookies and wafers 
the dough should be chilled on ice before using. Shape with 
a floured cutter and bake on well-greased sheets or inverted 
dripping-pans. Cookies require a rather quick oven. 

Molasses cookies. Add soda to molasses and beat thor- 
oughly, then add milk, shortening (melted), and other ingredi- 
ents. Use enough flour to make a soft dough, which must be 
chilled. Roll ^ in. thick. Bake 10 to 12 min. 

Sugar cookies. Mix according to General Directions and 
roll very thin. Bake about 10 min. 

Chocolate cookies. Additional ingredient : 2 oz. chocolate. 
Melt the chocolate and add to the mixture before adding the 
flour and milk. Proceed as for Sugar cookies (above). 

Filled cookies. Mix as directed for Sugar cookies (above) 
and roll about i in. thick. Place two cookies together with a 
spoonful of jelly, marmalade, or the following mixture between. 
Bake 12 to 15 min. 

Filling. 1 c. raisins, i c. sugar, i c. water, 1 tb. flour. Mix 
sugar and flour with the water, add the raisins (chopped), and 
cook till thick. 

Peanut cookies. Additional ingredient : \ c. chopped pea- 
nuts. Mix like Sugar cookies (above), adding peanuts to dry in-

General Directions. Separate the eggs ; beat the whites stiff 
and the yolks till light-colored and thick. Add the sugar to 
the beaten yolks unless otherwise directed, then all the liquid 
if rule calls for it. Stir in other dry ingredients and fold in 
the whites lightly. 



50 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Water sponge cake. Flavor with lemon extract and bake 
25 min. in a buttered and floured shallow pan. For cream 
pies etc. use two round pans. When cake is cool, split and fill. 
Dries quickly, but is good if used at once. 

Cheap sponge cake. Use vinegar for flavoring and bake 
35 min. in a moderate oven in a buttered and floured cake-pan. 
Does not keep well, so should be used at once. 

Rich sponge cake. Use lemon juice as flavoring ; a little 
grated lemon rind may also be added. Bake 30 to 40 min. in 
a moderate oven in a buttered and floured deep pan, preferably 
one with a tube. 

Sponge drops. Use vanilla for flavoring. Beat the whites 
of eggs till stiff and dry, then add sugar and continue beating. 
Mix in the yolks (well beaten), then flavor, and cut and fold 
in the dry ingredients. Shape with a teaspoon on unbuttered 
paper, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and bake 8 min. in a 
moderate oven. 

Lady fingers. Make like Sponge drops and shape long and 
narrow with a pastry bag or a spoon. 

Angel cake. Use whites of eggs only, flavor with vanilla, 
and add 1 tsp. cream of tartar to whites of eggs while beating. 
Beat till stiff, then add sugar gradually. Fold in flour, mixed 
and sifted 4 times with the salt, add vanilla, and bake 35 to 
45 min. in an unbuttered tube pan. (Only a pan that has 
never been buttered can be used in this way. Others must be 
buttered, but the crust of the cake will in that case be thicker.) 
Angel cake requires a hotter oven than sponge cake and may 
be covered with buttered paper when it begins to brown. 

Creamcakes. Cook water and butter in a saucepan, and as 
soon as it boils add flour and continue beating till mixture is 
smooth and thick. Remove from fire and add unbeaten eggs, 
one at a time, beating each one into the mixture separately. 
When all have been added, beat well and drop by the spoon- 
ful on a buttered tin, leaving spaces between. Bake 30 min. 
in a rather hot oven. When firm and brown remove, cool, 



STARCH 



51 



split, and fill with Cream filling (p. 58) or whipped cream. 
Recipe should make 10 to 12 creamcakes. 

Apricot priffs. Fill Creamcakes (p. 50) with stewed and 
sweetened apricots and serve with whipped cream as a des- 
sert. Crushed and sweetened strawberries may also be used. 

Vanilla eclairs. Make creamcake mixture, shape in long, 
narrow ovals, and bake. Fill with Cream filling (p. 58) and 
frost with Confectioner s frosting (p. 57). 

Chocolate eclairs. Make like Vanilla eclairs, adding 1 oz. 
chocolate to the filling and 1 oz. to the frosting. 

Coffee eclairs. Make like Vajiilla eclairs, flavoring both 
filling and frosting with 1 tb. coffee extract.

General Directions. All ingredients should be measured before 
the mixing is begun. Eggs should be washed and broken into a 
cup one at a time to test them before putting them into a bowl 
together. Cake-pans should be buttered and floured or lined 
with paper, which should project over two sides. The paper and 
unprotected ends of pan should then be buttered. Oven should 



52 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

be ready when cake is mixed. Except where otherwise directed, 
the butter should be well creamed and sugar added to it grad- 
ually. For Jelly roll and Cup cakes I the yolk and white of 
the egg should be beaten together. In all the other recipes 
the well-beaten yolks should be stirred into the butter and 
sugar, then the milk and sifted dry ingredients added alter- 
nately. If fruit, nuts, or coconut are to be used, they 
should be floured with a little of the flour and added next. 
Then fold in the whites of the eggs (beaten stiff) and flavor. 
Bake according to special directions. After baking is almost 
completed, test by inserting a clean wooden toothpick into the 
center of the loaf. If dry, cake is done. It should be well 
browned and elastic, and should shrink from pan ; there 
should be no singing sound. The oven should be carefully 
regulated while cake is baking. Divide the approximate time 
required into quarters. During the first quarter the cake should 
rise but not brown ; during the second the cake should continue 
to rise and begin to brown in spots ; during the third the 
rising should be completed and an even brown color develop ; 
during the fourth the cake will shrink slightly and dry off. 
The oven heat may be decreased during this last period if 
necessary. 

For variety, | to I c. currants, raisins, or citron (cut fine), 
^ c. chopped nuts, or 1 c. shredded coconut may be added to 
Cup cakes I, Cup cakes II, Loaf cake, Sour-milk cake, or Coffee 
cake. All may be frosted if desired except Coffee cake. 

Jelly roll. Beat egg until light and add the sugar gradu- 
ally ; then add the milk, flour sifted with baking-powder and 
salt, and lastly the butter (melted). Line bottom of dripping- 
pan with buttered paper. Spread mixture evenly in pan and 
bake I2min. in a moderate oven. Take from oven and turn 
on cheesecloth or paper sprinkled with powdered sugar. Re- 
move paper and cut off thin edges of cake. Spread with jelly 
or jam beaten a little, and roll. Then roll cake in cloth or 
paper till cool enough to retain its shape. 



STARCH 53 

Apricot roll. Make like Jelly roll, using stewed apricots 
instead of jelly. 

Layer cake. Mix according to General Directions, flavor 
with lemon or orange extract, and bake in layer-cake tins or 
gem-pans about 1 5 to 20 min. in a rather hot oven. Use any 
filling desired. 

Cup cakes I. Mix according to General Directions, flavor 
with any extract, and bake in gem-pans 15 to 20 min. in a 
rather hot oven. 

Cup cakes II. Follow directions for Cup cakes I (above). 

Loaf cake. Reserve the white of 1 egg for the frosting.

General Directions. Use white sugar for the first five recipes, 
and brown sugar for the remainder. Flavor with vanilla except 
for Barley candy, which requires lemon juice, and Peppermints, 
which require oil of peppermint. Measure ingredients, chop 
nuts, butter pans, and have ice water ready for testing, before 
beginning to cook the candy. 

Nut brittle. Put the sugar into an agate saucepan or a 
frying-pan and stir constantly until melted and light brown. 
Add the nuts to this while on the fire ; then pour immediately 
into a pan, which should be large so that the candy will not 
be over i in. thick. Mark in small squares when it begins to 
cool, and break when brittle. 

54 



SUGAR 55 

Barley candy. Put ingredients into an agate saucepan 
and stir over slight heat till sugar is dissolved. Then allow 
the candy to boil without stirring until it is very brittle when 
dropped into ice water. While cooking, the grains of sugar 
should be wiped off the sides of the saucepan with a pastry 
brush or a cloth, moistened well with cold water. When the 
candy is done, pour into pan and cut as above. 

Peppermints. Cook as for Barley candy (above) until the 
sirup will form a ball in ice water. Remove from the fire and 
let stand 10 min. Then flavor and beat until the candy grows 
thick and creamy. Drop by the teaspoonful on paraffin paper 
and remove when cold. This candy may be flavored with 
wintergreen and colored pink, or with vanilla and I oz. of 
melted chocolate. 

Fondant. Cook as for Peppermints (above) until the soft-ball 
stage is reached. Let stand 5 min. and pour out upon a well- 
greased platter. When the bottom of the platter is cool enough 
to be held on the hand, work the mixture with a wooden spoon 
till it becomes creamy, then knead into a smooth, firm ball, 
put into a bowl or jar, cover with paraffin paper and a plate, 
and let stand 24 hr. or longer. It may then be melted in a 
double boiler and used for dipping bonbons or for mints. 
Centers for creamed dates and walnuts should be shaped 
from bits of the unmelted fondant. 

Fudge. Put all ingredients except vanilla into an agate 
saucepan and boil, stirring seldom, until the mixture will form 
a ball in cold water. Flavor, set the pan into cold water, and 
beat till candy is creamy, or let it stand for 10 to 15 min. 
and then beat the candy. Pour into pan, and when cold cut 
in squares. 

Panocha. Make like Fudge (above), adding nuts and flavor- 
ing after the candy is cooked. 

Caramels. Put butter into saucepan and when melted 
add all other ingredients except vanilla ; stir constantly till 
chocolate is melted. Boil until mixture will form a firm ball 



56

when tested in cold water ; then add vanilla and pour into 
pan. Mark in squares when cool, and when hard enough, 
break and wrap in paraffin paper. 

Butter taffy. Additional ingredient: I tb. lemon juice. Boil 
all ingredients except butter and vanilla until the mixture is 
brittle when dropped into cold water. Add butter just before 
removing from the fire and vanilla before pouring into pan.

SUGAR 57 

General Directions. Most uncooked frostings should be spread 
on the cake when it is slightly warm. Cooked frostings and 
confectioner's frosting may be put on the cake when it is cold, 
and if difficult to spread, a knife dipped in boiling water may 
be used. 

To test sirup for frosting, take up a little on the end of 
teaspoon or fork. Let it drip above the saucepan, and if a fine 
thread blows off from the drop, the sirup is ready to use. 

Plain frosting. Beat white of egg until stiff ; add water, 
then sugar. Flavor (A tsp. vanilla or lemon extract may be sub- 
stituted for the lemon juice), and add more sugar if frosting 
is not stiff enough to spread. 

Confectioner's frosting. Add enough sugar to the water (boil- 
ing) to make it stiff enough to spread. Flavor and use at once. 

Boiled frosting. Cook sugar and water, as for Fondant 
(p. 55), until sirup threads. Pour slowly on the well-beaten 
egg white, and continue beating until frosting is thick enough 
to spread. Flavor. 

Chocolate frosting I. Melt I oz. chocolate and add to Boiled 
frosting while beating. 

Coffee frosting. Substitute A c. coffee for the water and 
omit vanilla. Follow recipe for Boiled frosting. 

Ornamental frosting. Add 3 tb. of the sugar to the unbeaten 
egg ; beat 2 min. Add 3 tb. more and repeat till all the sugar 
has been used ; the lemon juice may be added gradually as 
mixture stiffens. Add more sugar if needed to make the frost- 
ing stiff enough to spread. Test by taking a little on back 
of spoon and making a cut through ; if separation remains, 
frosting is ready to use for surface covering. If used with 
pastry tube, it may require still more sugar. 

Orange frosting. Additional ingredients : 2 tb. orange juice, 
grated rind 1 orange, and 1 tsp. grated lemon rind. Let the rind 
stand in the fruit juice for 5 min., then add this to egg yolk 
(slightly beaten), with enough sugar to make it of the proper 
consistency to spread. 



58 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Caramel frosting. Use brown sugar and make like Boiled 
frosting (p. 57). \ c - chopped nuts may be added. 

Chocolate frosting II. Additional ingredient : 3 oz. choco- 
late. Cook sugar and water till sirup threads, and pour slowly 
on the melted chocolate. Beat till thick ; flavor and spread. 

Chocolate frosting III. Additional ingredients : 2 oz. choc- 
olate, spk. salt. Melt chocolate over hot water ; add the milk 
slowly, then salt, yolk of egg, and flavoring. Mix till smooth, 
and stir in enough sugar to stiffen the mixture. 

Milk frosting. Put ingredients in saucepan. Stir to dissolve 
the sugar and boil 10 min. without stirring. Beat until thick 
enough to use ; flavor and spread. Crease when cool. 

Cream filling. Additional ingredients : 6 tb. flour, 1 tsp. 
salt. Use eggs whole. Scald milk. Mix sugar and flour, pour 
on them the hot milk, return to double boiler, and cook for 
10 min., stirring till thick. Add this to the eggs and cook 
2 min. longer. Flavor and cool. 

Chocolate cream filling. Use recipe for Cream filling and 
add 1 oz. melted chocolate with the eggs. 

Coffee cream filling. Use 1 c. strong coffee with 1 c. milk 
for the liquid and omit vanilla. Follow recipe for Cream filling. 

Lemon filling. Additional ingredients : rind of 2 lemons 
(grated), 4 tb. flour. Mix sugar and flour, add rind, lemon juice, 
water, and egg (slightly beaten). Put butter in a saucepan ; 
when melted add the mixture and stir till it boils, being 
careful not to burn it. Cool before spreading. 

Orange filling. Make like Lemon filling, using only | c. sugar, 
and rind of 1 orange instead of rind of 2 lemons. Substitute 
for the lemon juice 4 tb. orange juice and 1 tb. lemon juice. 

Fig filling. Additional ingredient : I c. finely chopped figs. 
Cook in a double boiler till thick enough to spread. 

Chocolate filling. Additional ingredient : 2 oz. chocolate.

Plain junket. Roll tablet fine ; heat milk until just luke- 
warm and add other ingredients. Stir a very little and pour 
into a serving-dish to harden. Serve with sugar and cream. 
Vary by using 1 tb. cocoa with the sugar. 

Caramel junket. Brown the sugar, add boiling water, and 
cook until reduced to | c. When cool add to lukewarm milk 
and proceed as for Plain junket. Serve with sweetened and 
flavored whipped cream. 

Cottage cheese. Use sour milk. Heat gradually until just 
lukewarm, strain, and press out all the whey. Add salt and a 
little cream, or butter. Pack into a mold to harden. 

Note. Butter may be made from milk by allowing the milk to stand 
long enough for the cream to rise. The milk should then be skimmed and 
the cream churned or shaken in a jar until the fat separates from the butter- 
milk. The butter should be thoroughly washed in ice water to remove all 
liquid and may then be salted if desired. Sweet or sour cream may be used.

Soft-cooked eggs. Put eggs into a saucepan, pour over them 
the boiling water, and let stand in warm place from 5 to 10 min. ; 
or put eggs into cold water and remove when water reaches 
boiling point. 



64 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Hard-cooked eggs. Cook as for Soft-cooked eggs, leaving 
eggs in hot water 45 to 50 min. If time is an object, they 
may be boiled for 15 min., but will be less digestible. 

Scrambled eggs. Beat the eggs slightly, add milk, salt, and 
pepper. Melt butter in a double boiler or a saucepan over an 
asbestos plate. Add the egg and stir constantly until thickened. 
Serve on toast, in potato cases, or in a deep dish alone. 

Scrambled eggs with tomato. Use J c. tomato in place of 
the milk and cook as in Scrambled eggs. Dried beef may also 
be added to the egg. Allow \X.o\ lb.; shred, soak 15 min. in 
warm water, then drain and cook with the egg. 

Dropped eggs. Make toast first, dip edges in boiling salted 
water, butter it, and put on a platter. Butter a frying-pan, put 
in water and salt, and when water reaches boiling point break 
in the eggs, one at a time. Pour the water over them gently 
with a spoon, and when the white is set take out carefully 
with a skimmer and serve on the hot toast. 

Omelet. Separate yolks and whites of the eggs and beat the 
whites stiff. Beat the yolks and add salt, pepper, and milk (or 
water if preferred). Melt butter in a frying-pan, and when 
brown, fold the beaten whites into the yolks mixture and turn 
at once into the hot butter. Cook without stirring until brown, 
then set frying-pan into the oven until the egg is firm. Fold 
in the middle and turn onto a hot platter. 

Bread omelet. Add to the egg yolks \ c. soft bread crumbs 
soaked in -|- c. scalded milk and omit liquid called for in recipe. 
Make as for Omelet. Either of these omelets may be served 
with Cheese sauce (p. 30) or Tomato sauce (p. 31); and chopped 
ham, grated cheese, or peas may be folded into them. 

Creamy eggs. Scald milk and add to it the butter, season- 
ings, and eggs (slightly beaten) ; cook till mixture thickens and 
serve on slices of toast. 

Creamed eggs. Additional ingredients : 4 tb. flour, | tsp. 
paprika. Cook the eggs hard and slice them ; reheat in a white 
sauce made from the other ingredients. These may be scalloped. 



PROTEIDS 



65 



Goldenrod eggs. Ingredients as for Creamed eggs. Chop the 
whites, mix with the sauce, and pour over buttered toast. Rub 
yolks through a strainer and sprinkle over the sauce. 

Baked eggs. Additional ingredients : 2 tb. flour, A c. but- 
tered crumbs. Break the eggs into buttered ramekins, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, cover with crumbs and a white sauce 
made from the other ingredients, and bake in a pan of hot 
water till crumbs are brown. Sauce and crumbs may be omitted, 
or \ c. chopped cheese may be added to the sauce.

beaten in ; the remainder of the sugar should then be care- 
fully folded in. Allow 4 tb. powdered sugar to whites of 3 eggs. 

Baked meringue. Allow the whites of 3 eggs and 8 tb. 
powdered sugar. Beat the whites of the eggs stiff and beat in 
A the sugar with egg-beater. Fold in remainder of sugar and 
bake 10 to 12 min. in a moderate oven. 

Baked custard. Scald milk ; beat eggs slightly, add sugar 
and salt, and slowly pour on this the hot milk, stirring con- 
stantly. Flavor, put into buttered cups, set in a pan of hot 
water, and bake until custard is firm. When done, a knife 
blade put into the center will not look milky. 

Chocolate custard. Use recipe for Baked custard, adding 
2 tb. cocoa to the sugar. The yolks of 3 eggs may be sub- 
stituted for 2 whole eggs. 

Caramel custard. Use I c. instead of i c. sugar, brown it, 
and dissolve it in the hot milk. Then proceed as for Baked 
custard. 

Soft custard. Prepare as for Baked custard (above), return 
to double boiler after adding milk, and cook, stirring con- 
stantly, until mixture thickens on spoon. Strain at once and 
flavor when cool.

custard. 

Fruit custard. Make by recipe for Soft custard, adding 1 c. 
of sliced bananas, oranges, pineapple, cooked dried apricots, 
prunes, or peaches, or a mixture of the first three. If a me- 
ringue is desired, use only egg yolks for the custard, allowing 
1 extra, and reserve the whites for the Meringue (p. 65). 

Tapioca custard. Cook prepared tapioca in milk until trans- 
parent, then proceed as for Soft custard (above). The white 
of egg may be beaten separately and stirred into custard when 
it is removed from fire, or may be reserved for a meringue. 
If pearl or flake tapioca are used, allow twice as much, wash, 
and soak for several hours in cold water. Drain before using. 



PROTEIDS 67 

Baked tapioca pudding. Use pearl tapioca. Soak 1 hr. in 
cold water to cover ; drain, add to milk, and cook in double 
boiler 30 min. Beat egg slightly, add sugar and salt, then

dressing (p. 68). 

Vegetable salad. Cut vegetables in well-shaped pieces, mix 
with the dressing, and serve on lettuce leaves or without. 
Potatoes, beets, beans, and carrots make a good combination. 
Use Plain salad dressing (p. 68) or Rich salad dressing

MEAT 

Source. Flesh of various animals, used as food. The most 
common meats are as follows : beef from the ox ; mutton from 
the sheep ; pork from the pig ; veal from the calf ; venison 
from the deer ; lamb from the lamb. 

Food Value. Largely for protein ; contains some fat. 

Cost. Variable. 

General Directions. As soon as meat is received from the 
market remove it from the paper and place on a plate in 
the refrigerator. When ready to use trim' off any discolored 
portion and wipe with a damp cloth. Fresh meat is bright 
in color, firm to touch, has no unpleasant odor, and is 
never slimy. 

Roast, Broiled, and Boiled Meats etc. 

Roast meat. Use lamb, mutton, beef, veal, or pork, select- 
ing tender cuts. Remove superfluous fat and trim off any dis- 
colored meat. Wipe thoroughly with a cloth wet in cold water, 
and sprinkle with flour, salt, and pepper. Place on a rack in a 



PROTEIDS 71 

dripping-pan, with pieces of the fat laid underneath. Put into a 
rather hot oven, and as soon as the meat is seared, reduce the 
heat, put a little water in the pan, and finish cooking the meat 
slowly. Allow 10 min. to a pound if desired rare, 15 min. if 
well done. If the gravy in the pan is very fatty, skim off 4 tb. 
of fat and use for making a brown sauce for the meat. If not 
fatty, 6 tb. flour may be mixed with a little cold water and the 
hot liquid in the pan poured slowly on it. The gravy should 
then be boiled, seasoned, and strained. Any drippings not 
used for the gravy may be saved and added to soup stock. If 
very fatty, use for fried potatoes. 

Broiled meat. Use rump, sirloin, or tenderloin steak, or 
mutton, lamb, or veal chops. Pork chops are usually sauted 
in their own fat. Round steak is sometimes used, but the 
meat is tough and may be better if cooked in other ways. Wipe 
the meat thoroughly with a damp cloth and trim off the 
fat. Grease a broiler with the meat fat, put in the steak, 
and cook over a hot fire from 8 to 12 min., according to the 
thickness of the meat. Turn every 10 sec, to sear both 
sides evenly. Put on a hot platter, and season well with salt, 
pepper, and butter. 

Pan-broiled meat. If a coal fire is not available, the meat 
may be pan-broiled ; that is, cooked in a frying-pan heated 
very hot and thoroughly greased, but with no fat left in pan. 
The meat should be turned frequently, as in broiling. When 
cooked, season and serve like broiled meat. 

Boiled meat. A leg or shoulder of mutton is generally used 
for boiling, other methods of cooking being more suitable for 
the other fresh meats. Wipe meat with a damp cloth and 
trim off superfluous fat. Plunge into boiling water and boil 
for 10 min. Then draw back on the stove and cook gently 
till done. Allow 10 min. per lb. if desired rare, 15 min. if 
well done. Serve with Drazvn-butter sauce (p. 29) to which 
\ c. capers have been added. Save the water for broth or 
stock and skim when cold. 



72 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Sauted meat. This method is commonly called frying, but 
since no fat is used except that which "tries out" from the 
meat, " sauteing is a more correct term. Ham, sliced, is gen- 
erally used. Allow a slice of ham weighing from I to il lb. for 
four people. It should be cut from f to i in. thick. Cover with 
warm water and let stand 15 min. Drain and wipe dry. Put 
into a hot frying-pan, brown quickly on both sides, then draw 
back on the stove and cook slowly for 1 5 min. Chops may be 
cooked by this method. 

Corned and smoked meats. Beef, ox tongue, and pork 
(smoked shoulder and ham) are usually selected for preserving 
by these methods. The fibers of the meat are toughened by 
curing, so it is necessary to allow a much longer time for cook- 
ing them (30 to 40 min. per lb.). Smoked meats should be 
soaked overnight before cooking, and both corned and smoked 
meats should be put over the fire in cold water and heated 
gradually. The water should then be allowed to boil very 
gently till the meat is tender. 

Corned beef may be served hot or may be pressed into a 
pan, weighted, and chilled so that it can be turned out of the 
mold. Sometimes the superfluous fat is removed and the meat 
chopped before pressing. This makes a more delicate dish. 

Corned shoulder is served hot or cold. Ox tongue, whether 
corned or smoked, should be trimmed and skinned after cook- 
ing, and served cold. 

Smoked shoulder or ham should be skinned, sprinkled with 
bread crumbs, stuck with whole cloves, and baked until brown 
(30 to 45 min.). It may then be served hot, with a brown sauce 
to which \ glass of currant jelly has been added, or served 
cold, without sauce.

General Directions. Meat should be cleaned and all dark 
portions rejected. Use cold water and simmer the soup. Where 
vegetables are required, a mixture of carrots, turnips, and 
celery is desirable (about half as much celery as of either of 
the others). Some salt may be added while meat is cooking. 
Pepper, and more salt if needed, should be added when soup 
is served. Save all meat from soup stock for made dishes. 

Soup stock. Additional ingredient: small bunch of herbs. 
Wipe meat, cut into small pieces, and have the bones cracked. 
Put the marrow, fat, bones, and meat into a kettle with the 
cold water. Let stand 30 min. ; then heat slowly to boiling 
point and cook gently 4 to 6 hr. with kettle covered. Prepare 
vegetables, cut in small pieces, add to the stock, with season- 
ings, and cook 1 hr. longer. Strain and cool quickly. Part 
of the meat may be rolled in flour and browned in a little of 
the meat fat, to give the soup a richer color. Use as a founda- 
tion for vegetable, rice, macaroni, tomato, and other soups. 
Bones and bits of cold cooked meat may be used for a soup 
stock, but the amount of water and seasonings should in that 
case be somewhat reduced. 

Lamb broth. Use neck of lamb or mutton. Wipe meat 
with a damp cloth and cut in small pieces. Put bones, gristle, 
and onion into the cold water and simmer gently for 2 hr. 
Cool slightly and skim off the fat or absorb it with clean brown 
paper. Strain over the meat and cook until latter is almost 
tender. Then add the rice, well washed ; boil for 20 min., 
season, and serve. 



74 



THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 



Scotch broth. Cook meat etc. as for Lamb broth (p. 73). 
Soak barley several hours and add it to the broth when the 
meat is added. Heat the vegetables in 2 tb. drippings or butter 
and cook in the soup until tender, adding them when broth 
from bones is strained over meat. 

White stock. Use celery only for the vegetables and buy 
knuckle of veal for the meat. Make like Soup stock (p. 73)

Wipe meat with a damp cloth, remove gristle, bones, and 
poorer parts of the meat, put them into cold water, and heat 
slowly to boiling point. Cut remainder of meat into inch cubes, 
roll them in the flour, and brown in a little of the meat fat, 
with the onion sliced thin. Add this to rest of meat etc. 
when the water reaches the boiling point. Cook slowly till meat 
is tender, i hr. before stew is to be served add carrot and 
turnip (prepared and cut in small cubes). Potatoes should be 
cut in eighths, parboiled, and cooked in the stew for 20 min. 
Season highly and remove large bones before serving. The 
stew may be thickened with flour if desired, and Dumplings 
(p. 43) may be served with it. 

Lamb or veal stew. Use shoulder of lamb or veal. Make 
like Beef stew without browning the meat and onion, and omit 
the vegetables. 

Italian stew. Additional ingredients : 2 c. tomatoes, 1 c. 
spaghetti, \\ slices salt pork, J tsp. curry, 1 tsp. paprika. Use 
raw meat (preferably round of beef), and run through meat-

sides in the hot fat. Place meat in a deep pan on a trivet or 
skewers. Pour fat and onion around it and add water to about 
half cover. Put into a slow oven and cook 3 or 4 hr., turning 
meat occasionally and renewing water if needed. The pan 
should be covered tightly to keep in the steam. When the 
meat is almost tender add vegetables and seasonings. Serve 
with gravy poured around the meat. Vegetables may be omitted 
if preferred, and the meat may be cooked on top of the stove 
if kettle is tightly covered. 

Jellied meat. Additional ingredients : 1 tsp. poultry season- 
ing, 10 peppercorns, 10 whole cloves, 1 bay leaf. Use shin of 
beef, with considerable meat on it, and have bones cracked. 
Cook slowly until meat shreds easily. Pick out lean meat, 
shred, and mix with poultry seasoning to taste. Strain liquor, 
boil down to 1 pt., pour over meat, and cool. 

Hamburg steak. Use round of beef. Wipe meat with a 
damp cloth and cut in small pieces, removing fat and gristle. 
Put through a meat-chopper, add seasonings, and form into 
8 round, slightly flattened cakes. Heat a frying-pan, grease 
with the meat fat, put in the cakes, and brown quickly on 
both sides. Draw back on the stove and cook slowly for 
10 min. Keep the meat hot while making the gravy. Try 
out fat in the frying-pan. Add flour and stir until well 
browned ; then stir into it slowly the boiling water or stock. Let 
this boil up once, season with salt, pepper, and any meat sauce 
if desired, and strain over the meat on a hot platter.

or bacon, 1 egg. Use round of beef. Wipe meat with a damp 
cloth and trim. Put through meat-chopper, add the other ingre- 
dients, and mix well, moistening with a little water or stock if 
too dry. Shape into a roll and place in a buttered pan. Brush 
over with melted butter and put thin slices of salt pork on the 
meat. Bake 30 to 40 min. in a moderate oven. Serve with 
Brown sauce (p. 30) or Tomato sauce (p. 31). Egg may be 
omitted, but cannelon will then not slice so well. 



PROTEIDS yy 

Meat loaf I. Additional ingredients: 1 lb. salt pork, 
4 Boston crackers, 4 tb. milk or stock, 1 tb. lemon juice or 
vinegar, 1 tb. tomato catsup or any meat sauce. Use any

pork fat. Serve cold. 

Meat rolls. Additional ingredients : 2 c. bread crumbs, 1 tsp. 
poultry seasoning, 2 tb. butter. Use round steak. Wipe meat 
and pound until rather thin. Cut in strips about 2 in. wide 
and 6 in. long. Moisten crumbs with boiling water, mash, and 
add seasonings and butter. Spread the meat with this mixture, 
roll up the strips, and tie securely. Dredge with flour and 
brown in hot drippings. Put into a saucepan, cover with water 
or stock, and simmer gently until meat is tender (2 hr. or more). 
Remove strings and serve in the gravy, without straining. 

Rolled beef may be prepared in the same way from the 
whole slice of steak, but will require 4 or 5 hr. cooking. 

Veal birds. Prepare as for Meat rolls, using thin slices of 
veal. Allow most of the water to evaporate ; when meat is 
tender add 1 c. milk or cream, and when heated thicken with 
2 tb. flour mixed with a little cold water. Use butter or salt 
pork for browning the meat before cooking. 

Liver and bacon. Additional ingredient : \ lb. bacon. The 
measured flour and water are for the gravy. Have liver sliced 
thinly and let stand in boiling water for 10 min. Drain and 
remove skin and membranes. Dry thoroughly, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, and dip in flour. Fry the bacon and keep 
warm while cooking the liver in the bacon fat. Turn occasion- 
ally to prevent burning. When cooked, pour off all but 2 tb. of 
the fat, add the flour to this, and stir till well browned. Add

General Directions. Make sauce from the butter, flour, and 
stock called for, using water if you have no stock. For lamb, 
veal, or chicken, milk may be used in place of stock. Butter 
or drippings may be used. Scrape onion for seasoning. All 
made meat dishes should be carefully prepared, and should be 
free from bone and gristle and well seasoned. 

Minced meat. Chop the meat fine. If there is no left-over 
gravy, cook the meat trimmings to make stock for the brown 
sauce. Add meat to this, simmer very gently for i min., season, 
and pour it over half slices of toast, which may or may not be 
buttered. Tomato catsup, onion juice, or any bottled meat sauce 
may be used for seasoning, and if the meat is mutton, lamb, 
veal, or chicken, a little nutmeg may be added. 

Meat hash. Beef is most suitable for warming in this way. 
Mix meat and mashed potato, season to taste ; add 1 the butter 
(melted), and the onion juice. Melt the rest of butter or drip- 
pings in a frying-pan ; when brown add the hash, and cook 
slowly till well browned at the bottom. Turn on a platter, with 
crust uppermost.

POULTRY 

Source. Flesh of domestic birds. 

Food Value. For protein. 

Cost. Variable. 

General Directions. Fresh poultry should be of firm texture 
and moderately fat, with a yellowish tinge to the skin. A bluish 
color shows cold-storage birds. A pliable breastbone, few 
scales on the legs, and small pinfeathers characterize young 
birds, while many scales and hairs on the skin denote age. 

Poultry should be picked and cleaned at the market, but the 
body cavity should be examined and cleaned again when ready 



PROTEIDS 83 

to cook. Never wash poultry before placing in refrigerator ; 
it may cause it to spoil quickly. Singe the bird, remove pin- 
feathers with a sharp knife, cut off the neck, leaving the skin, 
and remove oil-bag in tail ; then wash thoroughly and proceed 
as directed. 

To truss a fowl, run a skeWer through each leg and wing, 
pinning it close to the body. Then tie a piece of twine to the 
end of one wing skewer, run it across back of fowl to the 
skewer diagonally opposite ; connect this with skewer in other 
leg, then back to the other wing. This will hold fowl in shape 
without marking the breast. Remove skewers and string 
before serving. 

Boiled fowl. Dress, clean, and truss a 4-pound fowl ; tie 
in a piece of cheesecloth, place on a trivet in a kettle, half 
surround with boiling water, cover, and cook slowly till tender, 
turning occasionally. Add salt last hour of cooking. A piece 
of salt pork boiled with the fowl gives a good flavor and may 
be sliced and served with it. Serve with Drawn-butter sauce 
(p. 29), or with White sauce (p. 30), or with chopped celery, 
sliced eggs, or cooked oysters added to either sauce. 

Roast chicken. Clean, singe, and wash a 4-pound chicken, 
removing pinfeathers if necessary. Dry well and stuff, using 
recipe for Stuffing (below). Sew up openings and skewer into 
shape. Sprinkle with salt. Try out chicken fat, measure 3 tb., 
and mix with 2 tb. flour. Spread breast and legs of chicken 
with this mixture. Roast i| hr., reducing heat of oven after 
15 min. and basting chicken every 10 min. with chicken fat 
and hot water (2 tb. chicken fat to 1 c. water). Put more 
water in pan if chicken browns too fast, and use for basting if 
necessary. 

Stuffing. Ingredients : 

2 c. soft bread crumbs Onion juice 

4 tb. melted butter Salt 

1 tb. poultry seasoning Paprika 
Hot water 



84 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Mix ingredients in the order given, seasoning to taste and

Chicken fricassee. Dress, clean, and cut up a fowl. Put in 
a kettle, cover with boiling water, and cook slowly until tender, 
adding salt to the water when chicken is about half done. 
Remove from water, dry well, sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
dredge with flour, and saute in butter or pork fat. Arrange 
chicken on pieces of toast, and pour around it 2 c. white sauce, 
or reduce stock to 2 c, strain, and remove fat ; melt 3 tb. 
butter, add 4 tb. flour, and gradually pour on the stock ; cook 
until smooth and season. 

Brown fricassee. Make like Chicken fricassee, but serve with 
a sauce made by browning butter and flour before adding stock. 

Chicken pie. Ingredients : 

4-pound fowl 3 c. stock 

1 rule Quick paste (p. 102) 8 tb. flour 

1 slice onion 4 tb. chicken fat 

1 bay leaf Bit of parsley 
Salt and pepper 

Cook fowl in boiling water to which a bit of parsley, the 
onions, and bay leaf have been added. When tender, remove 
and let stock boil down. Cool and skim. Reheat 3 c. Melt 
the chicken fat, mix with the flour, and pour on slowly the hot 
stock. Separate meat into small pieces, removing large bones. 
Place inverted cup in middle of baking-dish, surround with 
chicken, and pour sauce over it, seasoning well. Cover with 
paste ; make several incisions in crust and bake in a moderate 



PROTEIDS 85 

oven till crust is well browned. Potato cubes and i c. small 
carrot cubes, both cooked till tender, may be added to the pie. 
Individual dishes may be used instead of one large dish. 

Roast turkey. Prepare as for roast chicken, using twice the 
amount of stuffing. Allow 1 5 min. to each pound for roasting. 
Serve with Giblct gravy (p. 84).

FISH 

Boiled, Broiled, Baked, and Fried Fish etc. 

Source. White-fleshed fish, as cod, haddock, pike, halibut, 
flounder, etc. ; oily-fleshed fish, as salmon, herring, mackerel, 
sardines, etc. 

Food Value. For protein and fat. 

Cost. Variable. 

General Directions. Fish is a useful food, on account of 
its food value as a substitute for meat and its low cost. It 
should be perfectly fresh, however, as serious illness is likely 
to result from the use of stale fish. When fresh the eyes 
should be bright, gills red, and flesh firm, and there should 
be no unpleasant odor. 

White-fleshed fish, being rather insipid, requires a well- 
seasoned sauce. 

Boiled fish. Salmon, halibut, swordfish, cod, or haddock 
may be used. Wipe fish thoroughly and, if whole, skin it if 
desired. Tie in a clean cloth or put into a wire basket. Plunge 
into boiling water, cook for 10 min. on front of stove, then 



86 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

draw back and simmer gently till done. Drain thoroughly, 
remove cloth, and serve with Egg sauce (p. 30). For a thick 
piece of fish allow 1 2 to 15 min. per pound ; for a thin piece, 
10 min. 

Broiled fish. Haddock, cod, bluefish, mackerel, etc., may be 
broiled whole ; swordfish, halibut, and salmon should be sliced. 
Wipe fish thoroughly, put into a well-greased broiler, and cook 
over hot coals till flakes separate, turning constantly, and cook- 
ing the flesh side longest. Remove from broiler carefully, and 
season with salt, pepper, and melted butter. To broil in a gas 
stove, put broiler in a dripping-pan, and cook at some dis- 
tance from the broiler flame, turning occasionally. Cooking 
may also be done in gas oven. Fish should then be placed 
on buttered tin sheet in a dripping-pan, seasoned and covered 
with buttered crumbs, and cooked 20 to 30 min. without turning. 
Broiled fish may be served with Tartar sauce (below). 
Tartar sauce. Ingredients : 

1 tb. vinegar \ tsp. salt 

1 tb. lemon juice \ tsp. paprika 

4 tb. melted butter Spk. cayenne pepper 

\ tsp. any prepared meat sauce 

Brown the butter slightly and then add the other ingredients. 
Heat before pouring over fish. 

Baked fish. Cod, haddock, and bluefish are most commonly 
used. Clean and wipe the fish, and fill with Stuffing (p. 83). 
Sew up fish, lay on a well-buttered fish-sheet in dripping-pan, 
brush over with melted butter or lay thin slices of salt pork on 
the fish, and add 1 c. hot water. Bake 45 to 60 min., unless 
small fish are used, when 30 min. will be sufficient. Serve with 
a gravy made from fat in pan as for Roast meat (p. 70), 
using water for the liquid, or with Parsley sauce (p. 30). 

Baked fillet of fish. Use thin slices of halibut, or swordfish, 
or cod, or haddock, skinned and boned. Place a layer of Stuff- 
ing (p. 83) between two pieces of fish, sprinkle with salt, pepper, 
and buttered crumbs, and bake in a moderate oven 30 to 45 min.,

General Directions. These fish have all been smoked or 
salted to preserve them and will be improved by soaking 1 hr. 
or more in warm water, unless the recipe requires that they 
should be cooked in water before using. Do not use steel 
knives or forks in preparing them except for cutting fish. 

Creamed salt fish. Fish should be shredded after soaking, 
or cut in very small cubes. Make a white sauce of remaining 
ingredients. Add the fish, reheat, and serve on toast or with- 
out. By using 2 c. milk and other ingredients in same propor- 
tion, 1 c. cold cooked potatoes, cut in cubes, may be combined 
with the fish. 

Spanish codfish. Additional ingredients : I A pimientos, 
1 c. tomato, l c. buttered crumbs. Use cold cooked potatoes. 
Prepare fish as for Creamed salt fish (above), draining thor- 
oughly. Make a tomato sauce of necessary ingredients. Place 
fish and potato in layers in a baking-dish, sprinkle with salt, 
pepper, and the pimientos cut in strips, pour over them the 
sauce, cover with crumbs, and bake until brown. Fish may be 
heated in the sauce and served without baking if preferred. 

Smoked salmon. Cover the fish with hot water and let stand 
where water will keep hot, but not boil, for 20 min. Drain 
well, brush the fish with 1 tb. of the butter (melted), and cook 
in oven 15 to 20 min., or till flakes separate. Remove to a 
hot platter and pour around it a white sauce made of the re- 
maining butter and other ingredients. Sauce may be omitted 
and fish seasoned with salt, pepper, and butter. 

Baked finnan haddie. Wash fish, put flesh-side down in a 
dripping-pan, cover with warm water, and let stand for 1 5 min. 
where heat is moderate. Drain thoroughly and dry. Put back 
in the pan, add 1 c. each milk and water, and bake 20 min. or 
till flakes begin to separate. Serve on a platter surrounded by 
Drazvn-bnttcr sauce (p. 29) made from other ingredients. 

Creamed finnan haddie. Flake left-over finnan haddie and 
proceed as for Creamed salt fish (above), omitting the toast 
for serving.

General Directions. Clams should be cleaned by pressing 
out the small black portion in the soft part of the clam, care- 
fully removing bits of shell, and washing as for oysters. 
Oysters must be picked over with the fingers to find pieces of 
shell ; they should then be washed by placing in a strainer and 
pouring A c. cold water over them. This liquid may be added 
to the oyster liquor if strained through cheesecloth to take out 
impurities ; both may then be used if needed, but should be 
heated and skimmed before using. Clean scallops like oysters, 
but do not reserve the liquor. Lobsters are better bought whole 
and opened at home. If lobster is fresh, the tail springs into 
place quickly when bent back. Remove claws and separate body 
from tail. Crack large claws and joints and take out meat. Cut 
the tail shell between the legs, remove meat, cut lengthwise, 



PROTEIDS 91 

and take out vein that runs through tail. Hold body in left 
hand with head down and pull out from upper shell, leaving 
head and stomach (lady) in the shell. Pick out meat from 
small bones, being careful to avoid the gills, which are rough 
and feathery. The green portion lying around the stomach is 
the liver and may be used if desired. 

Clam chowder. Additional ingredient: 1 tb. chopped salt 
pork. Separate hard and soft part of clams ; chop the former 
and cook with the water for 20 min. Cook pork and the

clams and water and cook 15 min. Add seasoning, the butter, 
and soft part of clams. Cook 10 min. and add the hot milk. 
Crackers may be added, and if preferred the crisp pork and 
onion need not be left in the chowder. 

Oyster stew. Scald milk and water. Prepare oysters care- 
fully. Wash them and strain the liquid through cheesecloth 
with the oyster liquor, put into a saucepan, heat, and skim ; 
add the oysters and cook gently till the edges begin to curl. 
Then add other ingredients and serve at once with oyster 
crackers. All milk may be used in place of the pint of water, 
and 1 qt. oysters may be used if desired. 

Panned oysters. Melt butter and add oysters, well cleaned, 
drained, and seasoned. Place oysters on squares of buttered 
toast, pour over each piece of toast a little of the prepared 
oyster liquor, and cook in hot oven till the edges of the oysters 
shrivel. Serve at once. 

Scalloped oysters. Additional ingredients : 1 c. bread crumbs 
or cracker crumbs, \ tsp. nutmeg. Prepare oysters. Mix crumbs 
and melted butter. Heat, skim, and strain oyster liquor and 
add to milk. Put layer of crumbs in bottom of baking-dish, 
then 1 the oysters and 1 the liquid, and season ; repeat, having 
crumbs on top. Bake 30 min. in moderate oven. 

Oyster pie. Additional ingredients : 1 tb. chopped parsley, 
1 rule Shortcake (p. 45) dough, 1 c. oyster liquor. Add the 



92 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

latter to the milk and make a white sauce with the butter and 
flour. Potatoes should be cooked and cut in cubes. Add these

moderate oven. 

Deviled scallops. Additional ingredients : 1- tsp. mustard, a 
few drops of tabasco sauce. Clean like oysters and cook for 
5 min. over hot water. Drain, add to the sauce, and season. 
Serve on buttered toast or crisped crackers. May be covered 
with buttered crumbs and baked till crumbs are brown. 
Mustard may be omitted. 

Deviled lobster, Deviled crabs, Deviled shrimps, Deviled 
clams, or Deviled oysters may be prepared like Deviled scallops. 

Creamed lobster. Additional ingredient : 1 c. celery, cut 
fine. Make like Deviled scallops (above), but omit mustard. 
Any shellfish may be used, and the mixture may be scalloped 
if desired. Rice may be substituted for the celery. 

Fried oysters. Additional ingredient: 1 egg. Use bread 
flour. Pick over, wash, and dry the oysters. Make a batter of 
the other ingredients. Dip oysters in this batter and fry in 
deep fat. Drain and serve on a folded napkin ; garnish with

General Directions. Prepare salads just before serving, as they 
wilt if allowed to stand long. Keep cold. Serve extra dressing 
with salad if desired. Any recipe for mayonnaise may be used, 
or a boiled dressing may be substituted. 



FATS AND OILS 97 

Vegetable salad. Use potatoes as a foundation. Cut in 
cubes ; freshen the celery and cut in small strips. Mix pota- 
toes with Butter salad dressing (p. 69) while hot, chill, and 
add celery and the other seasonings. Serve on lettuce leaves. 
Peas, beets, or other vegetables may be substituted for celery. 
If salad is a little dry, add 1 or 2 tb. cream or top of milk. 
Cooked mayonnaise (p. 96) may be used if preferred. 

Celery and apple salad. Pare and core apples and cut into 
small cubes. Let stand in ice water to which a little lemon 
juice has been added. Prepare celery by chopping or cutting 
it, add apple drained thoroughly, mix with the salad dressing, 
and serve at once on lettuce or without. May be served in 
apples with inside scooped out. The pulp should be used in 
the salad. 

Bird's-nest salad. Additional ingredients: 1 small cream 
cheese, 1 tb. finely chopped nuts. Use cabbage as a founda- 
tion, preparing as directed (p. 16). Mash the cheese, season, 
and make into 12 egg-shaped balls. Roll them in the chopped 
nuts. Drain cabbage thoroughly and mix with French dress- 
ing. Place on individual plates in shape of nests and put 
3 cheese balls in each. Lettuce may be used on the plates 
if desired. 

Pineapple salad. Additional ingredient : 8 maraschino 
cherries. Cut slices of canned pineapple so as to give a fan- 
shaped appearance to the outer edge. Arrange on lettuce 
leaves and season. Quarter the cherries and use for garnishing 
the slices of pineapple. Pour sweet French dressing over all. 

Egg-and-sardine salad. Additional ingredients : 8 sardines, 
8 stuffed olives. Cook eggs hard, chop whites, and rub yolks 
through a strainer. Shred the coarse leaves of lettuce and 
mix with them the whites of the eggs and the sardines (freed 
from skin and bones and broken in small pieces). Add the 
salad dressing and seasonings. When thoroughly mixed arrange 
on lettuce leaves, cover with the sifted yolks, and garnish with 
olives (cut in slices to show the pepper). 



98 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Fish salad. Use haddock, halibut, or salmon. Remove 
bones and skin, and flake the fish fine. Shred the coarser 
lettuce leaves, reserving the bleached ones for garnishing. 
Mix fish, shredded lettuce, and French dressing ; season and 
serve on lettuce leaves. Garnish with mayonnaise. Cooked 
dressing may be used for both oil dressings if preferred. 

Lobster salad. Remove lobster from shell ; clean and cut in 
small cubes and marinate with French dressing. Wash and 
dry the lettuce and shred the coarser leaves. Mix lettuce with 
the lobster and add a little of the mayonnaise and seasonings. 
Arrange in nests of the smaller lettuce leaves and put a 
spoonful of mayonnaise on each. More lettuce may be used. 

Shrimp salad. Remove shrimps from can and let stand in 
ice water for 20 min. Drain and remove vein and break in 
small pieces ; proceed as for Lobster salad. 

Meat salad. Veal may be used as a basis for this salad or 
cold lamb. If the latter is chosen, use \ cold ham to | lamb. 
The meat should be cut in small cubes entirely free from fat 
or gristle, and the celery (cut fine) mixed with it. Then pro- 
ceed as for Lobster salad (above), omitting the shredded lettuce 
if desired. 

Chicken salad. Make as for Meat salad, allowing equal 
parts of celery and chicken.

CROQUETTES, FISH BALLS, ETC. 

Source. General. 

Food Value. Contain all the food principles. 

Cost. See market prices and cost of individual items. 

General Directions. Frying. Frying is cooking food in 
enough hot fat to cover. The fat used must be inexpensive, 
as so much is required ; it should also be free from mois- 
ture, as water causes fat to spatter badly when heated to the 
high temperature required. Fats suitable for frying are lard, 
lard substitutes, drippings, etc. ; butter is undesirable because 
it is expensive and likely to spatter and burn. If food to be 
fried has not been previously cooked, the fat used should 
be hot enough to brown a bit of bread while one is count- 
ing 60. If the food has been cooked, count 40 while bread is 
browning. Reheat fat before putting in more food. When fat 
has been used for frying, it may be clarified for subsequent 
use, by cutting some slices of raw potato into it, heating slowly, 
and proceeding as for drippings. Be careful not to pour the 
sediment from the fat into the pail. 

Drippings may be prepared at home from any pieces of 
sweet meat fat, preferably beef. Cut the fat in small pieces 
and put in a deep kettle with about 1 in. of cold water. Heat 
slowly, stirring constantly, and cook gently till bubbling ceases. 
Cool slightly and strain through cheesecloth into a tin pail.

IOO THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Test fat as directed. Have a dripping-pan with brown paper 
in it near the stove. Fish balls and potatoes should be lifted 
from the fat with a skimmer and drained on the paper. Cro- 
quettes should be fried in a frying-basket and turned from 
that onto the paper. To shape croquettes take up I tb. of the 
mixture, roll into a ball, and then into a short cylinder. Dip 
in crumbs, in egg, and in crumbs again, before frying. The 
crumbs should be made from bread, dried in the oven, rolled 
fine, and then sifted. Dilute the egg with 2 tb. milk or water. 
Either white or yolk may be used, though less satisfactory 
than the whole egg. (This is in addition to any eggs called 
for in the list of ingredients.) A thorough coating of eggs 
and crumbs is required to hold croquettes in shape. 

Fried potatoes. Wash and pare medium-sized potatoes and 
cut in long strips about i in. thick. Let stand in cold water for 
i- hr. ; then drain, and dry thoroughly. Fry and drain according 
to directions for Frying (p. 99). Sprinkle with salt and paprika. 

Fish balls. Use salt fish and cut potatoes in cubes. Keep 
fish in cold water while shredding it. Prepare the potatoes, 
put them with the fish into boiling water, and cook till potatoes 
are soft but not watery. Drain thoroughly and beat till light. 
Add seasoning and egg (well beaten), beat well, and drop by 
the spoonful into hot fat. 

Potato croquettes. Additional ingredients: 1 tb. chopped 
parsley, \ tsp. scraped onion. Use hot riced potato, add other 
ingredients, shape, and fry according to General Directions. 

Rice croquettes. Additional ingredients : 1 tb. chopped pars- 
ley, 1 tb. tomato catsup, 1 tsp. any bottled meat sauce. Use 
cold boiled rice. Mix all together, shape, and fry according 
to General Directions. 

Sweet rice croquettes. Additional ingredients : 4 tb. sugar, 
spk. nutmeg, f c. rice (measured before cooking). Cook rice 
in water in a double boiler till very soft. Add butter, sugar, 
salt, and egg yolk, using a little milk to moisten if mixture 
seems very dry. Shape, dip in egg and crumbs, and proceed

General Directions. Butter, lard, and water should be ice-cold, 
except for Egg paste. Handle pastry as little as possible and 
avoid using too much flour in rolling. Lard substitutes may 
be used in place of the lard and butter, although the pastry is 
usually more satisfactory if directions are followed. 



102 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Quick paste. Sift all dry ingredients into a chopping-bowl. 
Chop in the shortening, add enough cold water to make a 
stiff dough, roll to about | in. thick, and use at once. Suit- 
able for Meat pie (p. 79), Apple dumplings (p. 104), etc. 

Chopped paste. Mix salt and flour, put in chopping-tray, add 
lard and butter, and chop till well mixed. Moisten to a dough 
with cold water, toss on floured cloth, pat, and roll out. Fold 
to make three layers, turn halfway round, pat, and roll out in 
long, narrow strip. Roll up like a jelly roll and cut in halves, 
using one half for each crust. Use for pies and turnovers. 
Requires a hot oven. 

Plain paste. Wash butter, pat, and form in circular piece. 
Add salt to flour and work in lard with fingers or case knife. 
Moisten to a dough with cold water. Toss on floured board, 
pat, and roll out. Lay butter in center of lower half and fold 
dough over it, turning upper half over it. Then turn right side 
of pastry over, the left side under, the butter ; pat and roll out. 
Fold so as to make three layers, turn halfway round, pat, and roll 
out; repeat; then roll as for Chopped paste (above), making roll 
short and thick. Use for pies, turnovers, or tarts. Pastry may 
be used at once or folded in cheesecloth or waxed paper and 
placed in cold place, not on ice. Requires a rather hot oven. 

Egg paste. Put butter and boiling water in a saucepan over 
the fire ; when it boils add flour and salt, and stir until mixture 
leaves sides of pan, keeping it over the heat. Then turn mix- 
ture into a bowl, cool, and beat in the unbeaten yolk of 1 egg ; 
when smooth add 1 whole egg and continue beating until the 
paste is smooth. 

Chou cases. Cut six rounds of paste from Quick paste (above) 
with a large-sized cooky-cutter and pipe Egg paste around the 
edges of these, using a pastry bag. Bake in a moderate oven 
till brown. Use as cases for creamed fish or meat, prepared 
as directed for Scalloped meat (p. 36) or Scalloped fish (p. 36), 
omitting the crumbs. Trimmings left from pies may be used 
for the rounds of paste. 



FATS AND OILS 



103 



Pates. Roll and cut the paste with biscuit-cutter and 
doughnut-cutter, making three times as many rings as rounds. 
Moisten edge of each round and place three rings on it, mois- 
tening the lower one. Bake about 20 min. in a moderate oven. 
Fill with oysters, chicken, lobster, etc., reheated in white sauce, 
and well seasoned. ( Allow 2 c. sauce to 1^ c. meat or fish. 

Tarts. Make and shape as for Pates, using only two rings 
for each tart. Fill with jelly or jam.

General Directions. Apple pie, Apricot pie, and Mock mince 
pie will require upper and under crusts, the other pies only an 
under crust and rim. Either paste may be used, as preferred. 
Roll the two crusts separately about 1 in. thick, keeping the 
paste as nearly round as possible. Cut paste somewhat larger 
than the pie-plate and fit it in loosely to allow for shrinking. 
Put in the under crust, brush with white of egg (to prevent 
filling from soaking into it), and make an edge with strips of 
the paste, holding them in place by moistening the top of each 
layer with cold water. Fill the pie and put on the top crust ; 
press edges together lightly and cut slits in the crust to let 
steam escape. 2 to 3 c. fruit will generally be needed for 1 pie. 



104 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

For a pie with under crust only, build up the edges with strips 
of paste to make it the required depth. Whenever possible, if 
the filling does not require a long cooking, bake the pastry- 
shell over an inverted pie-plate, pricking it many times with 
a fork to prevent the formation of air bubbles, then fill and 
finish cooking. 

Apple dumplings. Use rule for Quick paste (p. 102). Roll 
out the dough and cut in six equal pieces, as nearly square as 
possible. Wash, pare, and core the apples, put one in the center 
of each square, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, fold dough 
over them, pressing edges together, and bake in a buttered 
pan in a hot oven till crust is brown and fruit tender. Serve 
with a sweet pudding sauce. 

Apple pie. Prepare and slice the apples. Line plate as 
directed, put in the apples, add sugar, salt, and water, and finish 
according to General Directions. Bake about 40 min. in a hot 
oven, reducing the heat after pie begins to brown. A little 
grated lemon rind or \- tsp. cinnamon or nutmeg may be added 
if desired. 

Peach pie, Berry pie, or Cherry pie. Make according to 
recipe for Apple pie, reducing the amount of water if fruit is 
very juicy. Any of these may be baked in a deep pudding- 
dish, with only an upper crust. 

Apricot pie. Use stewed dried apricots, sweeten to taste, 
and proceed as for Apple pie (above). 

Dried peach pie or Dried prune pie. Make by recipe for 
Apricot pie. Flavor with lemon juice and lemon rind and 
remove stones from prunes. 

Mock mince pie. Additional ingredient : 1 lemon (juice and 
grated rind). Use raisins and rhubarb for the fruit. Chop them, 
and add the other ingredients. Mix well and bake with two crusts. 

Custard pie. Additional ingredients : i tsp. vanilla, a little 
nutmeg. Scald the milk ; beat eggs slightly, add sugar and 
salt, and pour on slowly the hot milk. Flavor and turn into a 
pie-plate lined with one crust according to General Directions. 



FATS AND OILS 105 

Bake about 30 min. in a rather hot oven, reducing heat when 
custard begins to set. 

Squash pie. Additional ingredients : \ tsp. nutmeg or cin- 
namon, 1 1 c. cooked and sifted squash. Scald the milk; mix 
sugar, egg, salt, spice, and milk. Pour this on the squash. 
Strain. Line pie-plate, pour in the squash mixture, and bake 
till crust is brown and the filling firm. 

Lemon pie. Additional ingredient: 6 tb. powdered sugar. 
Use juice and grated rind of the lemons. Bake a pastry shell 
according to General Directions and fill with a mixture made 
as follows : Mix dry ingredients, add lemon and egg yolks, 
and stir in slowly the boiling water. Cook in a double boiler 
for 15 min., stirring till thick. Turn this into the shell and 
cover with a meringue made from the whites of eggs and 
powdered sugar. Bake 10 min. in a moderate oven. 

Orange pie. Additional ingredients : juice ^ lemon, 4 tb. 
powdered sugar. Use both rind and juice of orange. Make 
like Lemon pie (above), putting white of 1 egg into the filling 
and reserving the other 2 for a meringue. 

Chocolate pie. Additional ingredients : 2 tsp. vanilla, 3 oz. 
chocolate, 2 tb. powdered sugar. Mix sugar, flour, and salt ; 
add the beaten yolks of eggs, the butter, and the boiling 
water with chocolate melted in it. Cook till thick, stirring 
constantly. Flavor and pour into a pie-shell made according 
to General Directions. Cover with a meringue made from the 
whites of eggs and powdered sugar, and bake about 10 min. 
in a moderate oven. 

Butterscotch pie. Additional ingredients : 4 tb. powdered 
sugar, 1 tsp. lemon juice. Use brown sugar for the filling. 
Scald 1 c. milk ; mix flour and salt with rest of cold milk, 
pour on the hot milk, return to double boiler, and cook till 
smooth and thick, stirring constantly. Melt butter, add sugar, 
and cook till mixture bubbles. Stir into the cornstarch mixture, 
then add the 2 egg yolks. Pour into a pie-shell, cover with 
a meringue, and bake about 10 min. 



106 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Florentine meringue. Additional ingredients : raspberry 
jam, chopped almonds. Use powdered sugar and whites of 
eggs only. Roll the paste into a sheet, cut in strips 2x4 in., 
and bake till light brown. Spread with jam, cover with a 
meringue, sprinkle with chopped almonds, and bake about 
10 min. in a moderate oven. Trimmings left from pies may 
be used for these. 

Banbury tarts. Additional ingredients: rind and juice of 
1 lemon, 1 common cracker, rolled fine. Beat egg slightly 
and add other ingredients. Roll out the paste and cut with 
large round cooky-cutter. Place 2 tsp. of the filling on ^ the 
paste, cover with the other rounds, press edges together, and 
bake about 20 min. in a rather hot oven. 

Melba tarts. Make chou cases (p. 102) and fill with 
apricot jam.

General Directions. The ice-cream freezer should be thor- 
oughly scalded before being used. Allow 3 parts of ice to 
1 part of salt for freezing ice cream or sherbet ; equal parts 
of ice and salt for packing a mousse. The crank should be 
turned slowly. Always wipe cover before removing it, pushing 
down the ice and salt so that they cannot fall into the cream. 
Any crushed acid fruit or juice may be substituted for that 
required in Orange ice or Pineapple sherbet. Ice cream may be 
flavored with extracts or 3 tb. cocoa, 1 c. pounded macaroons, 
4 tb. sugar (caramelized), or 1 c. sliced bananas, peaches, or 
crushed strawberries or preserved ginger may be added. Pre- 
served fruit and juice may also be used, in which case it should 
be substituted for part of the milk. These recipes are for thin 
cream. Heavy cream may be used for richer mixtures. 

Orange ice. Boil sugar and water 20 min. Add other in- 
gredients, strain, and freeze. 

107 



108 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Pineapple ice. Make like Orange ice, substituting 2 c. grated 
pineapple for the orange juice. Leave pineapple in the sirup. 

Lemon ice. Use recipe for Orange ice, substituting the juice 
of 4 more lemons for the orange juice. 

Pineapple sherbet. Make like Pineapple ice (above), soaking 
the gelatin in | c. cold water and dissolving it in the sirup. 
The fruit should not be strained from the sirup. 

Lemon milk sherbet. Mix juice and sugar and stir con- 
stantly while adding the cold milk ; strain and freeze. 

Custard ice cream. Additional ingredients : 2 tb. flour, \ tb. 
vanilla. Omit vanilla and use lemon juice if fruit is added to 
the ice cream. Mix flour and sugar, add 2 c. of the milk, and 
cook 15 min. in a double boiler, stirring often. Add the eggs 
(1 or 2 may be used), cook 3 min., strain, and cool. Add the 
other ingredients, folding in the whipped cream last. Freeze 
according to General Directions. 

Chocolate ice cream. Add 2 oz. melted chocolate to cooked 
mixture of Ctistard ice cream. 

Vanilla ice cream. Add 1 c. of the milk to the cream and 
whip until foamy. Add other ingredients and freeze. See 
General Directions for use of fruit or chocolate.

thick turn into a melon mold, cover tightly, sealing with a strip 
of cloth dipped in melted drippings, and pack in ice and salt 
from 1 to 3 hr. Other fruits may be used. 

Coffee mousse. Use recipe for Ginger mousse, omitting 
ginger and substituting 1 c. coffee for 1 c. of the milk. 



IX 
CANNING AND PRESERVING 

By careful preparation and sterilization, fruits and vegetables 
may be cooked in their season and kept for winter use by 
being sealed tightly in glass jars. 

Canning implies the use of little or no sugar. Sound fruit 
and vegetables, not overripe, should be selected. Wash and 
prepare according to kind, remove imperfections, and pack in 
sterilized jars. If vegetables are used, add I tb. salt for each 
pint jar, and fill to overflowing with cold water. Put on the 
covers, but do not use rubbers or fasten the clamp at first. 
Set jars on a rack in a large boiler of cold water, cover closely, 
bring to boiling point, and boil I hr. Remove jars from water 
and clamp on the cover. Repeat the cooking process for 2 days 
in succession, being careful to unclamp covers while cooking. 
At the third cooking the covers should be removed quickly, 
just before the jars are put back into the cold water, and rub- 
bers, dipped in boiling water, placed on them. This method 
is called intermittent sterilization, and food so prepared keeps 
well, as both spores and bacteria are destroyed. Tomatoes may 
be stewed, then canned as above, without water. If fruit is used, 
pack it into the jars after preparing and weighing it, and fill 
the jars with sirup instead of cold water. The amount of sirup 
to make may be determined by allowing ^ to | lb. sugar to 
each pound of fruit according to its sweetness, and 2 c. water 
for each pint jar. Sirup should be boiled from 5 to 10 min. 
before being added to the fruit. 

Two precautions should be observed in this method of can- 
ning — the jars should always be put on to heat in water of 
the same temperature as the contents of the jar, and they 
should not touch during the cooking process. 

109 



no THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

To sterilize jars wash, fill with cold water, place on a rack 
in a pan containing enough cold water almost to cover them, 
bring to boiling point, and boil 15 min. Do not empty till 
ready to fill with fruit. Covers also should be sterilized. 

Preserving requires more sugar than canning. The fruit 
should be washed and prepared as for canning, and a sirup 
made, allowing l to 1 lb. sugar for each pound of fruit and only 
enough water to dissolve the sugar. Cook the fruit in this 
sirup till tender and seal in sterilized jars as in canning. 

Hard pears, quinces, etc., are better if cooked in clear water 
till almost tender, as long cooking with sugar tends to harden 
the fruit. Use the water in which they were cooked for 
making the sirup. 

JELLY-MAKING 

General Directions. Wash fruit, cut in small pieces, and if 
hard fruits like apples and crab apples are used, almost cover 
with water ; grapes and currants should be washed, but will 
require no water. Cook till fruit is very soft, drain through a 
coarse sieve, then put in jelly bag and drain overnight. Allow 
equal amounts of juice and sugar. Boil juice 20 min. Heat 
sugar, add to juice, and boil 5 min. Skim and pour into 
sterilized glasses. 

Orange marmalade. Ingredients: 

3 oranges 2 qt. water 

1 lemon 4 qt. sugar 

Use all the fruit except the seeds. Cut fruit into small pieces, 
and rind into thin strips. Add the cold water and let stand

Put in sterilized glasses or jars. 
Amber marmalade. Ingredients : 

1 lemon 1 orange 

1 grapefruit Sugar 

Water 



CANNING AND PRESERVING in 

Wash fruit and cut up small. Measure and add three times as 
much water. Soak overnight ; then boil till tender. Let stand 
overnight again, measure, add three times as much sugar, and 
boil till thick and jellylike (about 2 hr.). Put into sterilized 
glasses or jars. 

PICKLING 

The preservative action of vinegar and spices is so effective 
that unless there is much moisture, pickles may be kept in 
covered crocks or jars. If liquid, they should, however, be 
sealed like preserves. Vegetables should be washed thoroughly 
and all decayed portions removed.

FOOD FOR INVALIDS 

In preparing food for invalids or convalescents, the instruc- 
tions of a physician should be obtained and carefully followed. 
Diets may be classified as follows : 

i. Fluid diet 

2. Light soft diet 

3. Soft, or convalescent, diet 

4. Special diets 

In general the first is suitable for patients with slight fever, 
the second for those who may have very easily digested solid 
food, the third for convalescents, the fourth for patients who 
must omit some one class of foodstuffs entirely. 

All should be daintily and attractively served, in small 
amounts. 

FLUID DIET 

This diet comprises such foods as milk, broths, beef juice, 
beef tea, tea, coffee, cocoa, lemonade, barley water, rice water, 
toast water, albumenized fruit juice, gruels, and milk soups. 
Many of the recipes may be found in their respective places ; 
recipes follow for those not previously given. 

Eggnog. Beat 1 egg; add | tb. sugar and beat well. Add 
I c. milk or cream and flavor with 1 tsp. vanilla, or 1 tb. brandy, 
or 1 tb. coffee extract. Strain into a glass and serve cold. 

Fruit eggnog. Make as above, using 2 tb. sugar, | c. water,

In addition to the diets given on pages 1 1 3-1 1 5, a diet for con- 
valescents may be selected from the following foods : chicken, 
sweetbreads, squabs, white fish, bacon, eggs (except hard-cooked 
whites), potatoes (except fried), peas, asparagus, cauliflower, 
salads, fruits, desserts, occasionally chops or steak. Recipes for 
most of these dishes may be found by reference to the Index.

Add 1 tb. each of salt and vinegar to 1 qt. water, bring to 
the boiling point, add sweetbreads, and simmer 1 5 to 20 min. 
Drain and put into cold water. Cool quickly and remove 
membrane, fat, and veins. The meat may then be split and 
broiled for 10 min. ; or creamed and served on toast or in bread 
or potato cases ; or used as salad ; or rolled in beaten egg and 
bread crumbs and baked till brown, then served with White 
sauce (p. 30). Green peas are a suitable accompaniment for 
sweetbreads.

XII 
SELECTION OF FOOD 

HOW TO PLAN MEALS 

In the choice of food for an individual or a group of people, 
there is great need of an understanding of the properties of 
food and the work which it must do in the body. The classi- 
fication of food has been given elsewhere ; its selection and 
combinations only will be considered here. 

It is frequently said that appetite is the best guide in the 
choice of food for the individual. That is probably true of 
a normal appetite, but most appetites have become so perverted 
by misuse that it is not safe to trust entirely to them. Two 
points, then, must be borne in mind in planning the daily 
dietary : first, that food must be of good quality, well prepared, 
attractively served, and wisely combined, in order to please 
the eye and palate and so stimulate digestion ; second, that it 
must meet the needs of those for whom it is prepared, both 
as to quantity and composition. 

To fulfill the first two requirements is easy. Buy the best 
that can be obtained (not always the most expensive, but that 
which is seasonable and of high grade), then prepare according 
to methods which have proved satisfactory. Food out of season 
is always an extravagance and is often of inferior quality. 

Attractive serving depends on the fact that the eye governs 
the taste and that food which is unattractive in appearance is 
distasteful and therefore indigestible. Avoid overdecoration, 
though a slight garnishing adds greatly to the aesthetic value 
of many dishes. Slices of lemon, pimientos, stuffed olives, 
hard-cooked eggs, shredded lettuce, watercress, parsley, or 

137 



138 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

any greens suggested by one's ingenuity may be used to gar- 
nish savory dishes, while whipped cream (delicately colored), 
candied cherries, angelica, chopped nuts, etc., are suitable for 
cakes and desserts. Be careful that greens which may wilt are 
not used on hot dishes, and remember that whipped cream 
liquefies on hot desserts. 

To obtain variety serve only a few kinds of food at a meal, 
but vary the selection for each meal. Once a day is enough to 
use meat in most families ; in its place fish and the various 
meat substitutes may be included in the luncheon menu, while 
eggs, salt fish, baked beans, or a hearty cereal (such as whole 
oatmeal or cracked wheat, served with plenty of milk) may re- 
place it for breakfast. If a starchy vegetable is desired for two 
meals, use potatoes for one and rice, macaroni in its various 
forms, hominy, or sweet potatoes for the other. Where a sec- 
ond vegetable is desired, choose a succulent one, such as greens, 
asparagus, onions, turnips, or carrots for a hot dish and cucum- 
bers, lettuce, tomatoes, celery, or cabbage for a cold dish. Avoid 
vegetables similar in flavor or texture ; even the color should be 
different, except at a formal meal, which may carry out a color 
scheme. When meat is served with gravy, a second sauce 
should not accompany the vegetables, nor should two creamed 
dishes be used at the same meal. 

Bread in some form, butter, and a beverage are permissible 
at all meals, but while coffee and tea have no food value except 
for the milk and sugar added, cocoa is distinctly nourishing 
and should only be used to increase the nutritive value of a 
meal. When the first course is soup, no beverage should be 
served except a small cup of after-dinner coffee, as too large an 
amount of liquid weakens the power of the gastric juice to 
digest the solid foods. 

It is probably true that it is impossible, under normal con- 
ditions, to serve too many fresh fruits and vegetables if care is 
taken to select them wisely and to have the diet otherwise 
balanced. Our common habit of beginning a meal with fruit 



SELECTION OF FOOD 139 

stimulates the digestive system and puts it into condition to 
receive the foods more difficult of digestion. The same is true 
of the use of hot soup. On the other hand, we place sweets at 
the end of a meal in order that they may leave a pleasant sen- 
sation and excite the flow of the gastric juice ; they should not, 
however, be used for this purpose at the beginning of a meal, 
since they are so satisfying as to lessen the desire for more 
nourishing food. And while an excessive use of relishes and 
condiments is not to be recommended, they, also, undoubtedly 
serve much the same purpose, since highly seasoned food 
increases the secretion of the digestive juices. Thus many of 
our common practices have a physiological basis which we 
cannot afford to ignore in the choice of our food. 

Yet it is also true that many of our eating habits are bad. 
Sugar on rice used as a vegetable, butter for seasoning fat 
meats, oil dressings or rich sauces on meat or fish, sirup on 
griddlecakes, ice cream as a sauce for pies, whipped cream on 
chocolate, bonbons during a meal — all may be relished by the 
epicure, but should be indulged in only by those whose diges- 
tions are excellent. And any combination is difficult to digest 
if, as in fried food or pastry, starchy materials are coated with 
fat. These should not necessarily be wholly excluded from the 
diet, but should be served infrequently and eaten in moderation. 

For the second point to be considered in the choice of food, 
namely, that it should meet the needs of the individual as to 
quantity and composition, some standard for estimating those 
needs is essential. It is not enough that food should build and 
repair the tissues and framework of the body, it must also fur- 
nish heat to maintain the body temperature and supply energy 
for its work ; that is, it must have a caloric 1 value. And while 
the building and repairing of the tissues and framework of the 
body can be done only by protein and mineral salts respectively, 

1 A calorie is the unit by which heat is measured. It is commonly reckoned 
as the amount of heat required to raise one kilogram of water one degree 
centigrade. 



140 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

all foods except mineral salts may yield heat. Protein and carbo- 
hydrates supply 4 calories per gram, while fats and oils furnish 
9 calories per gram. Protein should not be depended on too 
largely as a source of energy, not only because it is generally 
an expensive source of heat, but because the body can care for 
only a moderate amount of it. From one eighth to one tenth 
of the amount of heat required by the body may generally be 
furnished by the protein in the diet without harm. Scientists 
have demonstrated that an average daily need is for food that 
will supply 2400 to 3500 calories, the smaller amount being 
required by a woman at light muscular work, the larger by a 
man at moderately active muscular work. Age and sex modify 
the requirement, which is reduced by a sedentary occupation 
and increased by vigorous out-of-door life. Children under 
sixteen require from three tenths to eight tenths of the larger 
number of calories. 

Dr. Langworthy says in the Scientific Monthly for March, 
1916 : 

A consideration of the results of American experiments and other data 
has led us to conclude that, with our ordinary food habits, involving, as they 
do, the use of a considerable variety of foods in reasonably liberal quantities, 
one is justified for many purposes in discussing dietetics on a basis of 
energy only, since a diet which supplies 3000 to 3500 calories of energy 
per man per day, as ours very commonly does, almost inevitably supplies 
the needed protein, ash, and other constituents also. Particularly is this 
the case when one takes pains to include in the diet a reasonable amount 
of milk, green vegetables, and fruit. 1 

The daily menus given at the end of this section are based 
on the needs of a man requiring 3500 calories per day, giving 
due consideration to the inclusion in those menus of a proper 
amount of each foodstuff, namely, protein, fat, starch, sugar, 
and ash (mineral salts). To supply the latter the housekeeper 

1 The reader is referred to a reprint of this article issued by the Journal of 
Home Economics, Baltimore, Md., for further valuable information; also to a 
publication of the American School of Home Economics, Chicago, 111., entitled 
" Food Values," which gives an excellent list of 100-calorie portions. 



SELECTION OF FOOD 141 

must know their chief sources. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen 
are present in all foods, while nitrogen and sulphur are found 
in all protein, so these are easily supplied in the diet. A liberal 
supply of milk, eggs, and cheese will furnish calcium and phos- 
phorus, the latter being also abundant in whole grains and 
vegetables. Sodi?im is largely used, being one of the ingredi- 
ents of common salt and also being found in many vegetables. 
Chlorine is supplied by common salt. Vegetable foods, espe- 
cially spinach and prunes, are valuable sources of iron, while 
entire wheat contains both iron and magnesium, which is also 
present in cocoa, chocolate, dried beans, almonds, walnuts, pea- 
nuts, and oatmeal. Dried beans and peas, figs, dates, prunes, 
raisins, cocoa, and most acid fruits furnish a relatively large 
amount of potassium. 

For further assistance in arranging a family dietary, the food 
values given for each group of recipes may be consulted. No 
one meal need include all the foodstuffs if all are represented 
in the menus for the day. It is likewise true of the daily cal- 
oric need that a slight lack on one day may be made up by a 
corresponding increase on the next. 

The menus which follow may be modified to suit the needs 
of one or more individuals. By way of contrast with the well- 
balanced meals are given three examples of meals containing 
an excess of the food principle indicated, in the hope that they 
may assist in the avoidance of such mistakes.

PREFACE 

This book presents a rather large collection of tested and 
economical recipes, in such a manner as to show their relation 
to one another and to the whole question of balanced meals. 
The plan of the book is novel, but it is hoped that it will the 
more commend itself to the public for that very reason. It is 
absolutely essential that the General Directions which accom- 
pany each group of recipes should be read and followed ; also 
that the references should be carefully traced. If the house- 
keeper calculates the cost of each dish as she prepares it, the 
columns headed Price wOl serve as a reasonably accurate 
guide to the cost of her daily meals. 

The book has grown out of many years of classroom work, 
and the arrangement is designed, by omitting all unnecessary 
directions, to force the student to reason out the recipes for 
herself. But it is a cookbook, not a textbook, and laboratory 
directions and explanatory text are purposely omitted. 

In preparing the book, the bulletins of the United States 
Department of Agriculture, magazines dealing with the sub- 
ject of food, and many standard works on dietetics and the 
preparation of food have been freely consulted. 

The author wishes to express her gratitude to the many 
friends who have allowed her to use their original recipes, as 
well as to those who have read and criticized the manuscript.

THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 



INTRODUCTION 

Food is anything which, taken into the body, rebuilds the 
tissues, yields heat and energy, or aids in body processes. 
All foods contain one or more chemical compounds, and the 
amounts of those compounds furnish a means of classifying 
foods, as follows : (i) Proteids, containing nitrogen, supply 
tissue-building materials and yield heat and energy, but, as they 
alone can build tissue, should not be depended upon as heat- 
givers. (2) Starch and sugar (carbohydrates) yield energy and 
heat, because they contain carbon. (3) Fats and oils (hydro- 
carbons) give a larger amount of heat, but are less valuable as 
proteid-sparers and, like starch and sugar, may be stored as fat 
in the body. (4) Mineral salts aid largely in forming bones, 
teeth, hair, and nails, and assist in the processes of digestion, 
assimilation, metabolism, circulation, respiration, etc. (s) Water 
is necessary to support life, carry away waste, soften food for 
digestion, and, by evaporation, keep the body at its normal 
temperature. 

Food is cooked to destroy any germs it may contain and 
to render it more palatable, more digestible, or both. 

Cooking is the preparation of food by the aid of heat The 
common methods of cooking are (i) with water, as boiling, 
steaming, simmering, and stewing ; (2) in the oven, as roast- 
ing or baking ; {3) by direct heat, as broiling ; (4) with fat, 
as flying or saut^ing. 

Careful and accurate measurements are necessary for good 
results in cooking. Cups which are to be filled with liquid 



d,:...l,CjOO^:;Ic 



2 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

should be placed on a plate to avoid spilling. To fill a cup 
with any dry material, put the food into the cup by the spoon- 
ful until heaping full, and then level with the back of a case 
knife. Butter should be packed into the cup (or spoon) with 
a knife, then leveled. 

To measure dry material by the spoonful, dip in the spoon, 
fill full, then level as above. A half spoonful should be 
measured as above, then divided lengthwise into halves. 

Measure acid substances with agate or glass cups and stir 
with a wooden or silver spoon. 

Sift powdered sugar, flour, meal, etc. before and after 
measuring. If materials are all prepared and measured before 
beginning to mix the ingredients, much time and confusion 
may be saved. Study the recipes carefully, and if several cook- 
ing processes are involved, attend first to that which requires 
the most time. When more than one material is to be pre- 
pared, begin with that which will be least harmed by standing ; 
for example, when celery and apples are to be used as a salad, 
the celery should be cut up first, as the apples will discolor if 
exposed to the air. 

Use as few utensils as possible in- your work, and as soon 
as you have finished using them, arrange them neatly for 
washing. Bowls, etc., which have contained eggs, starchy 
mixtures, cereals, or milk, should be soaked in cold water ; 
hot water should be used for anything which has held sugar. 
Greasy dishes should first be wiped with clean, soft paper 
(which should be burned), and then soaked in hot, soapy water.

MINERAL SALTS 9 

General Directions. Fruit should be kept in a cool place 
and should be thoroughly washed before being used for the 
table or for cooking. All decayed portions should be carefully 
removed. Apples must be pared, except for baking ; cran- 
berries should be picked over thoroughly ; grapefruit should 
be cut in halves, the seeds removed, and the pulp separated 
from the tough membrane ; pineapples should be pared, the 
eyes removed with a sharp knife, and the fruit shredded with 
a silver fork ; bananas should be peeled and scraped ; oranges 
for slicing should be pared with a sharp knife in order to re- 
move the thin as well as the thick skin, and sliced so that the 
core will not be included ; lemons should be cut crosswise, not 
from stem to blossom end ; rhubarb, when young and tender, 
should not be peeled, as the red skin gives an attractive color 
to the sauce. 

Baked apples. Pare and core apples (or, if it is desired 
to retain the color, do not pare) ; put in a buttered baking- 
dish, fill centers with sugar and spice mixed, pour the water 
around them, and bake in a moderate oven until soft, basting 
occasionally. The dish should be covered. 

Stuffed apples. Additional ingredients: 4 tb, raisins, 2 tb. 
chopped nuts. Mix these with the sugar, which may be either 
brown or white, and proceed as above. Serve with whipped 
cream. 

Glazed apples. Boil sugar and water gently for 5 min. 
Quarter and core the apples ; put \ the pieces into the sirup, 
removing when soft ; put in the remainder of the apples and 
cook in the same way. When all are cooked, strain sirup over 
them. Lemon rind, thinly pared, may be cooked in the sirup 
if the apples are not sour, or a bit of stick cinnamon or ginger 
root may be added. 

Apple sauce. Quarter the apples and cook with the water 
until soft enough to rub through a strainer, adding sugar and 
spice ibaat 10 min, before removing from fire. If sauce is 
desired unstrained, core the apples before cooking. 

d,:...l,CjOO^:;Ic 



lO THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Cranberry sance. Add sugar and water to berries; cover 
and boil lO min. Strain if desired. 

Cranberry jelly. Cook berries with the water for 15 min. 
Strain, rubbing as much as possible through sieve, add sugar, 
cook 5 min., and pour into a mold or glasses. 

Baked bananas. Cut bananas in quarters, lengthwise, and 
place in a buttered baking-dish. Mix sugar and lemon juice, 
adding i tb. melted butter if desired ; spread this mixture over 
the fruit and bake in a slow oven till bananas are soft, basting 
with the juice at least once. May be served with whipped 
cream or as a vegetable. 

Fmlt machine. Oranges, grapefruit, bananas, pineapples, 
peaches, and strawberries may be used, combining two or 
more kinds. Fruit should be prepared according to General 
Directions, then mixed with the sugar and lemon juice 
and chilled before serving. May be used as a dessert, or, 
under name of "fruit cocktail," as the first course for a 
formal luncheon. 

Fruit punch. Use juice of fruit only. A good combination 
is made by using i lemon, i orange, and J c. grape juice or 
^ c. strong tea. Boil sugar and water, then add the fruit juice. 
It is better to chill the punch than to add ice to it. 

Rhubarb sauce. Cut rhubarb into inch lengths and put into 
an agate or porcelain-lined saucepan with just enough water 
to cover bottom. Cook until soft and sweeten to taste. May 
also be baked until soft. 

YEGETABLES

Method I. Melt butter in a saucepan and stir in the flour 
without removing the saucepan from the stove. Add J of the 
milk, stir until the mixture boils, then beat until the sauce is 
perfectly smooth ; add another third of the milk and repeat the 
stirring and beating ; then add remainder of milk, and when 
the sauce boils, season as required. This method develops the 
flavor of the sauce better than Method 2 and Method j. 

Method 2. Melt butter in a double boiler, stir in the flour. 
then add the milk {cold). Stir constantly till sauce thickens. 
Add seasonings. 

Method J. Scald | c. milk and mix the flour with remain- 
der of the milk before adding hot liquid. Cook at least 
IS min. in double boiler, stirring until thick. Butter and 
seasonmg should be added last. This method of making is 
considered better for those of weak digestion. 

Mock kollandaise sauce. Make like White sauce {medium), 
Method I, using 2 tb, butter instead of i tb. Just before 
removing from fire add yolk of i egg mixed with a little of 
the sauce, and when ready to serve, stir in \ tb. lemon juice. 

Cheese sauce. Add to White sauce (medium). Method 2, 
\c. chopped cheese and stir until melted. 

Brown sauce. Butter and onion should be cooked g min., 
then flour added and browned ; add liquid J at a time, as for 
While sauce, Method i. Onion may be omitted if desired, 
and I tsp. vinegar, catsup, or Worcestershire sauce added. 

Sauce piquante. Add to Brown sauce I tb, chopped cucumber 
pickles, I tb. vinegar, i tsp. walnut catsup, and i tsp. capers. 



D,....L,C.oo8lc 



STARCH 31 

Tomato sauce. Make like Brown sauce (p. 30), but do not 
allow butter to brown. 

Tomato cream sauce. Additional ingredient : -^ tsp. soda. 
Add the soda to the hot tomato stock, and when bubbling 
ceases, stir the tomato, a little at a time, into a white sauce 
made from the remaining ingredients. 

Yeast Bread and Rolls 

Source. Universal. Made from cereals, ground into meal or 
flour ; their use in some form extends through the civilized 
world. 

Food Value. Largely for starch, but contain considerable pro- 
tein, and when served with butter provide a well-balanced food. 
Cost. 

Yeast cake, z ^. 5-cent loaf = 20 to 24 slices 

Bread, 5 ^ per loaf. 5-cent loaf = 5 c, crumbs, 

Yeast. A microscopic plant, always present in the air. 
Grows and multiplies rapidly in a warm, moist, sweet, nitroge- 
nous soil. Given these, as in bread, its presence causes some 
of the starch to be changed to sugar and then into alcohol and 
carbon dioxide. These, in their attempt to escape, cause the 
dough to rise.

32 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

General Directions. Amounts of flour given should be used 
cautiously, as different brands vary greatly. For all these recipes 
the yeast should be dissolved in lukewarm water (i yeast cake 
to \ c.) before using. Pour hot liquid over butter, sugar, and 
salt. Add yeast to the above mixture when it is lukewarm. 
For Waier bread and Milk Bread add enough flour to knead. 
For Graham bread and Whole-wheat bread all the flour should 
be added and the whole well beaten. Set in a warm place, cover- 
ing the bowl well, and let stand 8 or lo hr,, or until double 
its bulk. Knead for a second time, then shape the dough or, 
for Graham bread and Whole-wheat bread, beat well. Fill 
pans \ full, let rise until twice its original size, and bake in a 
moderate oven until it is light and well browned and there is 
no crackling in the loaf (45 to 75 min.). 

Water bread. Will make 2 loaves or 2 pans of biscuits. 
Use only enough flour to make a dough that can be handled 
easily, and knead until smooth and elastic. 

Milk bread. See Water bread (above). Half water and half 
milk may be used in place of 2 c. milk. 

Graham bread. Will make r loaf. Should rise in pans until 
a little less than twice original size. 

Whole-wheat bread. Proceed as for Graham bread (above). 

Rolled-oats bread. Additional ingredients: \ c, molasses, 
I c. rolled oats. Add boiling water to rolled oats, let stand \ hr., 
and add other ingredients ; let rise overnight, beat thoroughly, 
turn into buttered bread-pans ; let rise again, and bake. 

Raised flour muffins. Additional ingredient: I egg. Add 
butter, sugar, and salt to hot milk ; when lukewarm add yeast 
cake to this mixture, then egg (well beaten) and flour. Beat 
thoroughly, cover, and let rise overnight. In the morning fill 
buttered gem-pans \ full, let rise till pans are full, and bake 
30 min. in moderate oven. 

Oatmeal muffins. Additional ingredient: \c. cold cooked 
oatmeal. Mix the hot milk with the oatmeal and proceed as 
for Raised flour muffins (above), omitting the egg. 



STARCH 33 

Parker House rolls I. Put milk, butter, sugar, and salt into 
a mixing-bowl. When lukewarm add yeast and 3 c. flour. 
Beat well, cover, and let rise till light. Add enough more 
flour to make dough stiff enough to knead, and let rise again. 
When double its bulk, knead again, roll out, shape, and let 
rise till light in buttered pan. Bake in hot oven 12 to 15 min. 
If made overnight, ^ yeast cake is enough. 

Luncheon rolls. Additional ingredients : 1 egg, 1 tb. lard, 
^ tsp. grated lemon rind. Add sugar, salt, and shortening to 
milk. When lukewarm add yeast and J c. flour. Cover and let 
rise ; then add egg, lemon rind, and enough flour to knead, and 
let rise again. Roll ^ in. thick, shape with biscuit-cutter, place

rise overnight. Roll out in a thin sheet, brush with melted 
butter, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and roll like a jelly 
roll. Cut in small slices, place close together in a buttered 
baking-pan, let rise till double their bulk, and bake about 
30 min, in a hot oven. The process may be completed in a 
day if I yeast cake is used. The dough may be spread in a 
large pan, brushed over with i egg, and, after rising, may be 
covered with the following mixture : 3 tb. butter, 2 tb. sugar, 
2 tb. flour, I tsp. cinnamon. When baked it should be broken 
into small squares. 

Buns. Additional ingredient : ^ c. raisins (stoned and quar- 
tered). Add the sugar, salt, and butter to the milk ; when luke- 
warm add yeast and ij-c. flour; cover and let rise till light;

General Directions. For toast, cut bread in slices of uniform 
thickness, put into toaster, hold some distance from fire until 
dried through, then brown quickly on both sides. In a gas 
stove bread may be put into large baking-pan in broiling-oven, 
but must be carefully watched and turned. (Old pieces of bread 
may be dried, rolled, sifted, and kept in jars to use for frying 
or scalloped dishes. Cover with cheesecloth.) 

Plain toast. Toast bread ; butter, and send to table at once. 

Hot-water toast. Toast bread ; put butter and salt in a 
shallow dish, pour over them the boiling water, dip each slice 
quickly in this, using a knife and fork. Send to table hot, with 
slices piled on top of each other. 

Cream toast. Toast bread ; make a white sauce of remain- 
ing ingredients ; dip each slice of toast into this, put in a 

d,:...l,CjOO^:;Ic 



STARCH 35 

covered dish, and strain the rest of the sauce over the toast. 
Toast may be buttered before dipping. 

Egg toast. Beat egg, add sugar, salt, and milk. Dip shoes 
of bread separately into this mixture, and when all have been 
softened, brown on both sides on a hot, well-greased griddle 
or frying-pan. Use only enough fat to keep bread from 
sticking. Serve for breakfast or lunch or, with a sweet sauce, 
for dessert. 

Cheese sandwiches may be made by the following recipe : 
Omit sugar, and after browning toaSt lay thin slices of cheese 
between 2 slices of toast, sprinkle with salt and paprika, and 
place in oven till cheese is melted. 

Tomato cream toast. Additional ingredient: \ tsp. soda. 
Heat tomato, add soda, stir, and strain. Add this to sauce 
made from other ingredients, season, and proceed as for 
Cream toast (p. 34). Serve immediately. 

Croutons. Use stale bread and cut about | in. thick. Butter 
well, using softened or melted butter. Cut in strips | in, wide, 
then cut these in cubes. Bake in a moderate oven till golden 
brown, shaking the pan occasionally. 

Duchess crusts. Brown the strips of bread, making them 
^ in. wide. Grated cheese may be spread on the crusts before 
baking. Season with cayenne pepper. 

Cronstade cases. Cut slices of bread 2 in. thick. Stamp 
rounds from these with a cooky-cutter and scoop out the inside, 
leaving a shell. Brush over with melted butter and brown. 
Oblong cases may be made by dividing slices of bread in halves 
and scooping out the center. Fill with creamed vegetables, 
fish, or meat.

General Directions. Dry ingredients should be sifted, the sugar 
with them except in Doughnuts. If eggs are not separated, 
they may be combined with milk after being beaten. Butter 
should be melted and added last, just before whites of eggs. To 
saut^ (brown on both sides in shallow fat) the first five mix- 
tures, use a heavy frying-pan, griddle, or waffle iron. Grease 
well with salt pork, drippings, or butter. If latter is used, re- 
move pan to back of stove when adding fresh fat, then reheat. 
Use only enough fat to keep food from sticking. For the dough- 
nuts and the fritters use lard, or any lard substitute ; butter is 
unsuitable. Put fat in a deep kettle, having plenty to cover the 
food. For full directions for frying see Frying (p. 99) and 
Croquettes (p. 99) and follow carefully. 

Buckwheat cakes. Additional ingredients : buckwheat flour 
should be used, also 4 tb. corn meal, 2 tb, molasses, ^ tsp. soda. 



d,:_..l,CjOO^:;Ic 



40 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Sift all dry ingredients except the soda. Add yeast dissolved in 
a little of the water, then the lukewann water and molasses. 
Beat well, let rise overnight, and in the morning stir in the 
soda and beat well. Cook by the spoonful on a hot, well- 
greased griddle. 

Rajsed wafBes. Mix like Raised flour muffins (p. 32), 
omitting the egg. When well risen add the egg and cook in 
a well-greased waffle iron till brown. Serve with butter and 
sugar or sirup. 

Plain waffles. Sift dry ingredients ; add milk to beaten 
egg yolks and combine the two mixtures. Then add the butter 
(melted) and the whites of eggs (beaten stiff). Cook and serve 
as for Raised waffles (above). 

Griddlecakes. Mix like Plain waffles (above) and cook by 
the spoonful on a hot, well-greased griddle. 2 c. sour milk and 
I tsp. bicarbonate of soda may be substituted for the sweet milk 
and baking-powder. The eggs need not be separated and are 
sometimes omitted if sour milk is used. 

Bread griddlecakes. Additional ingredient: 2 c. soft bread 
crumbs. Scald milk and pour it over the bread crumbs. Let 
stand till cool and proceed as for Plain waffles (above). Cook 
on a griddle as for Griddlecakes (above). 

Doughnats. Additional ingredient: \ tsp. spice (either 
nutmeg or cinnamon or a combination of both). Beat the eggs 
light without separating and add the sugar and the butter 
(melted) ; then add the milk and lastly the dry ingredients sifted 
together. More flour may be used to make the mixture stiff 
enough to roll out, but it should be kept as soft as possible. 
It will roll more easily if chilled on ice before handling. Divide 
into quarters and roll out one quarter at a time. Cut with a 
floured doughnut-cutter and fry in deep fat. Drain on brown 
paper. Stir the trimmings into the next quarter of dough and 
proceed as before till all dough is used. The fat should be hot 
enough to brown a bit of bread while counting 60. The dough- 
nuts may be sprinkled with sugar after being fried. 



d,:_..l,CjOO^:;Ic 



STARCH 



41 



Com fritters. Additional ingredients : i c. corn, ^ tsp. pa- 
prika. Use canned corn, or cold cooked com cut from the cob ; 
cliop it and add the milk. Stir in the dry ingredients and 
when well mixed add the eggs, well beaten. Drop by the 
spoonful into hot fat, and when brown drain on brown paper. 
Test the fat as for Doughnuts (p. 40). 

Com oysters. Make like Com fritters, omitting i egg and 
the milk and using ^ c. flour with less seasoning. Cook on a 
hot, well-greased griddle. 

Fruit fritters. Additional ingredient: 1 to i^ c. fruit, cut 
in small pieces. Make a batter as for Griddlecakes (p. 40) ; stir 
the fruit into this and fry by the spoonful in hot fat. Bananas, 
apples, oranges, pears, or peaches may be used. Use bread 
flour.

General Directions. For all these mixtures containing sugar, 
the shortening should be creamed and the sugar added grad- 
ually. Add the egg (beaten); then add the milk and the sifted 
dry ingredients alternately. When sifdng dry ingredients, re- 
serve part of flour in case all is not needed. The shortening 
may be all butter or a mixture of butter and lard or sweet 
drippings. Any preferred spice may be used and amounts 

d,:...l,CjOO^:;Ic 



48 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

A/aried to suit individual tastes. Molasses cookies may be made 
with all lard or drippings. Add only enough flour to make the 
dough stiff enough to handle ; too much will make the cookies 
tough and hard. Roll out only a small portion at a time and 
keep the remainder cool till ready to use. Add the trimmings 
to a fresh portion of the dough. For thin cookies and wafers 
the dough should be chilled on ice before using. Shape with 
a floured cutter and bake on well-greased sheets or inverted 
dripping-pans. Cookies require a rather quick oven. 

Molasses cookies. Add soda to molasses and beat thor- 
oughly, then add milk, shortening (melted), and other ingredi- 
ents. Use enough dour to make a soft dough, which must be 
chilled. Roll J in, thick. Bake lo to 12 min. 

Sugar cookies. Mix according to General Directions and 
roll very thin. Bake about 10 min. 

Chocolate cookies. Additional ingredient: 2 oz. chocolate. 
Melt the chocolate and add to the mixture before adding the 
flour and milk. Proceed as for Sugar cookies (above). 

Filled cookies. Mix as directed for Sugar cookies (above) 
and roll about \ in. thick. Place two cookies together with a 
spoonful of jelly, marmalade, or the following mixture between. 
Bake 1 2 to 15 min. 

Filling. I c. raisins, \ c. sugar, \ c. water, i tb, flour. Mix 
sugar and flour with the water, add the raisins (chopped), and 
cook till thick. 

Peanut cookies. Additional ingredient: ^ c. chopped pea- 
nuts. Mix like Sugar cookies (above), adding peanuts to dry in- 
gredients and having the dough soft enough to drop from tip of 
teaspoon onto a buttered pan. Allow room for mixture to spread. 
Place ^ peanut on each and bake 10 min. in a moderate oven. 

Ginger wafers. Additional ingredient : ^ tsp. soda. Dough 
should be soft enough to spread with a knife on an inverted 
dripping-pan. Bake quickly and cut in squares as soon as it 
is taken from the oven. Run a broad-bladed knife under the 
wafers, holding it very flat, to remove them from the pan.

Nut wafers. Additional ingredients : ^tsp. vanilla, ^c. nuts 
(almonds or walnuts). Mix like Sugar cookies (p. 48), roll 
very thin, cut with small cutter, place \ nut on each wafer, 
and bake a delicate brown. A mixture of butter and lard is 
desirable for the shortening. 

Hermits. Additional ingredient: | c. raisins, stoned and cut 
small, added to the creamed butter and sugar. Allow twice as 
much cinnamon as of clove and nutmeg for the teaspoonful 
of spice. Roll about | in. thick. Cut and bake as usual. 

Jumbles. Mix according to General Directions, roll ^ in. 
thick, and bake about 10 min. in a hot oven. 

Ginger snaps. Additional ingredient: J tsp. soda. Heat 
molasses and shortening to boiling point. Add dry ingredients, 
mixed and sifted. Chill thoroughly and roll very thin. Cut with 
a small round cutter and bake in a moderate oven.

the beaten yolks unless otherwise directed, then all the liquid 
if rule calls for it. Stir in other dry ingredients and fold in 
the whites lightly. 

d,:..:l,CjOo^:;Ic 



50 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Water spoi^e cake. Flavor with lemon extract and bake 
2$ mill, in a buttered and floured shallow pan. For cream 
pies etc. use two round pans. When cake is cool, split and fill. 
Dries quickly, but is good if used at once. 

Cheap spoi^e cake. Use vinegar for flavoring and bake 
35 min. in a moderate oven in a buttered and floured cake-pan. 
Does not keep well, so should be used at once. 

Rich sponge cake. Use lemon juice as flavoring ; a little 
grated lemon rind may also be added. Bake 30 to 40 min. in 
a moderate oven in a buttered and floured deep pan, preferably 
one with a tube. 

Sponge drops. Use vanilla for flavoring. Beat the whites 
of eggs till stiff and dry, then add sugar and continue beating. 
Mix in the yolks (well beaten), then flavor, and cut and fold 
in the dry ingredients. Shape with a teaspoon on unbuttered 
paper, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and bake 8 min. in a 
moderate oven. 

Lady fingers. Make like Sponge drops and shape long and 
narrow with a pastry bag or a spoon. 

Angel cake. Use whites of eggs only, flavor with vanilla, 
and add i tsp. cream of tartar to whites of eggs while beating. 
Beat till stiff, then add sugar gradually. Fold in flour, mbced 
and sifted 4 times with the salt, add vanilla, and bake 35 to 
45 min. in an unbuttered tube pan. (Only a pan that has 
never been buttered can be Used in this way. Others must be 
buttered, but the crust of the cake will in that case be thicker.) 
Angel cake requires a hotter oven than sponge cake and may 
be covered with buttered paper when it begins to brown, 

Creamcakes. Cook water and butter in a saucepan, and as 
soon as it boils add flour and continue beating till mixture is 
smooth and thick. Remove from fire and add unbeaten eggs, 
one at a time, beating each one into the mixture separately. 
When all have been added, beat well and drop by the spoon- 
ful on a buttered tin, leaving spaces between. Bake 30 min, 
in a rather hot oven. When firm and brown remove, cool,

General Directions. All ingredients should be measured before 
the mixing is begun. Eggs should be washed and broken into a 
cup one at a time to test them before putting them into a bowl 
together. Cake-pans should be buttered and floured or lined 
with paper, which should project over two sides. The paper and 
unprotected ends of pan should then be buttered. Oven should 

d,:...l,CjOO^:;Ic 



52 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

be ready when cake is mixed. Except where otherwise directed, 
the butter should be well creamed and sugar added to it grad- 
ually. For Jelly roll and Cup cakes I the yolk and white of 
the egg should be beaten together. In all the other recipes 
the well-beaten yolks should be stirred into the butter and 
sugar, then the milk and sifted dry ingredients added alter- 
nately. If fruit, nuts, or coconut are to be used, they 
should be floured with a little of the flour and added next. 
Then fold in the whites of the eggs (beaten stiff) and flavor. 
Bake according to special directions. After baking is almost 
completed, test by inserting a clean wooden toothpick into the 
center of the loaf. If dry, cake is done. It should be well 
browned and elastic, and should shrink fronrt pan ; there 
should be no singing sound. The oven should be carefully 
regulated while cake is baking. Divide the approximate time 
required into quarters. During the first quarter the cake should 
rise but not brown ; during the second the cake should continue 
to rise and begin to brown in spots ; during the third the 
rising should be completed and an even brown color develop ; 
during the fourth the cake will shrink slighdy and dry off. 
The oven heat may be decreased during this last period if 
necessary. 

For variety, |- to i c. currants, raisins, or citron (cut fine), 
\ c, chopped nuts, or \ c. shredded coconut may be added to 
Cup cakes /, Cup cakes II, Loaf cake. Sour-milk cake, or Coffee 
cake. All may be frosted if desired except Coffee cake. 

Jelly roll. Beat egg until light and add the sugar gradu- 
ally ; then add the milk, flour sifted with baking-powder and 
salt, and lastly the butter (melted). Line bottom of dripping- 
pan with buttered paper. Spread mixture evenly in pan and 
bake iz min. in a moderate oven. Take from oven and turn 
on cheesecloth or paper sprinkled with powdered sugar. Re- 
move paper and cut off thin edges of cake. Spread with jelly 
or jam beaten a little, and roll. Then roll cake in cloth or 
paper till cool enough to retain its shape.

SUGAR 55 

Barle7 candy. Put ingredients into an agate saucepan 
and stir over slight heat till sugar is dissolved. Then allow 
the candy to boil without stirring until it is very brittle when 
dropped into ice water. While cooking, the grains of sugar 
should be wiped off the sides of the saucepan with a pastry 
brush or a cloth, moistened well with cold water. When the 
candy is done, pour into pan and cut as above. 

Peppermints. Cook as for Barley candy (above) until the 
sirup wiU form a ball in ice water. Remove from the fire and

and remove when cold. This candy may be flavored with 
wintergreen and colored pink, or with vanilla and i oz, of 
melted chocolate. 

Fondant. Cook as for Peppermints (above) until the soft-ball 
stage is reached. Let stand 5 min, and pour out upon, a well- 
greased piatter. When the bottom of the platter is cool enough 
to be held on the hand, work the mixture with a wooden spoon 
till it becomes creamy, then knead into a smooth, firm ball, 
put into a bowl or jar, cover with paraffin paper and a plate, 
and let stand 24 hr. or longer. It may then be melted in a 
double boiler and used for dipping bonbons or for mints. 
Centers for creamed dates and walnuts should be shaped 
from bits of the unmelted fondant. 

Fudge. Put all ingredients except vanilla into an agate 
saucepan and boil, stirring seldom, until the mixture will form 
a ball in cold water. Flavor, set the pan into cold water, and 
beat till candy is creamy, or let it stand for 10 to 15 min.

General Directions. Most uncooked frostings should be spread 
on the cake when it is slightly warm. Cooked frostings and 
confectioner's frosting may be put on the cake when it is cold, 
and if difficult to spread, a knife dipped in boiling water may 
be used. 

To test sirup for frosting, take up a little on the end of 
teaspoon or fork. Let it drip above the saucepan, and if a fine 
thread blows off from the drop, the sirup is ready to use. 

Plain frosting. Beat white of e^ until stiff ; add water, 
then sugar. Flavor (|- tsp. vanilla or lemon extract may be sub- 
stituted for the lemon juice), and add more sugar if frosting 
is not stiff enough to spread. 

Confectioner's frosting. Add enough sugar to the water (boil- 
ing) to make it stiff enough to spread. Flavor and use at once. 

Boiled frosting. Cook sugar and water, as for Fondant

egg ; beat 2 min. Add 3 tb. more and repeat till all the sugar 
has been used; the lemon juice may be added gradually as 
mixture stiffens. Add more sugar if needed to make the frost- 
ing stiff enough to spread. Test by taking a little on back 
of spoon and making a cut through ; if separation remains, 
frosting is ready to use for surface covering. If used with 
pastry tube, it may require still more sugar. 

Orange frosting. Additional ingredients : 2 tb. orange juice, 
grated rind i orange, and i tsp, grated lemon rind. Let the rind

Roast, Broiled, and Boiled Meats etc 

Roast meat. Use lamb, mutton, beef, veal, or pork, select- 
ing tender cuts. Remove superfluous fat and trim off any dis- 
colored meat. Wipe thoroughly with a cloth wet in cold water, 
and sprinkle with flour, salt, and pepper. Place on a rack in a 

d,:...l,CjOO^:;Ic 



PROTEIDS yi 

dripping-pan, with pieces of the fat laid underneath. Put into a 
rather hot oven, and as soon as the meat is seared, reduce the 
heat, put a little water in the pan, and finish cooking the meat 
slowly. Allow lO min, to a pound if desired rare, 15 min, if 
well done. If the gravy in the pan is very fatty, skim off 4 tb. 
of fat and use for making a brown sauce for the meat. If not 
fatty, 6 tb. flour may be mixed with a little cold water and the 
hot liquid in the pan poured slowly on it. The gravy should 
then be boiled, seasoned, and strained. Any drippings not 
used for the gravy may be saved and added to soup stock. If 
very fatty, use for fried potatoes. 

Broiled meat. Use rump, sirloin, or tenderloin steak, or 
mutton, lamb, or veal chops. Pork chops are usually sauted 
in their own fat. Round steak is sometimes used, but the 
meat is tough and may be better if cooked in other ways. Wipe 
the meat thoroughly with a damp cloth and trim off the 
fat. Grease a broiler with the meat fat, put in the steak, 
and cook over a hot fire from 8 to 1 2 min., according to the 
thickness of the meat. Turn every 10 sec., to sear both 
sides evenly. Put on a hot platter, and season well with salt, 
pepper, and butter. 

Pan-broiled meat. If a coal fire is not available, the meat 
may be pan-broi!ed ; that is, cooked in a frying-pan heated 
very hot aiid thoroughly greased, but with no fat left in pan. 
The meat should be turned frequently, as in broiling. When 
cooked, season and serve like broiled meat. 

Boiled meat. A leg or shoulder of mutton is generally used 
for boiling, other methods of cooking being more suitable for 
the other fresh meats. Wipe meat with a damp cloth and 
trim off superfluous fat. Plunge into boiling water and boil 
for 10 min. Then draw back on the stove and cook gently 
till done. Allow 10 min, per lb. if desired rare, 15 min. if 
well done. Serve with Drawn-butter sauce (p. 29) to which 
\ c. capers have been added. Save the water for broth or 
stock and skim when cold.

72 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Sauted meat. This method is commonly called frying, but 
since no fat is used except that which "tries out" from the 
meat, " saut^ing " is a more correct term. Ham, sliced, is gen- 
erally used. Allow a slice of ham weighing from i to i| lb. for 
four people. It should be cut from ^ to i in. thick. Cover with 
warm water and let stand i s min. Drain and wipe dry. Put 
into a hot frying-pan, brown quickly on both sides, then draw 
back on the stove and cook slowly for 1 5 min. Chops may be 
cooked by this method. 

Comed and smoked meats. Beef, ox tongue, and pork 
(smoked shoulder and ham) are usually selected for preserving 
by these methods. The fibers of the meat are toughened by 
curing, so it is necessary to allow a much longer time for cook- 
ing them {30 to 40 min. per lb.). Smoked meats should be 
soaked overnight before cooking, and both corned and smoked 
meats should be put over the fire in cold water and heated 
gradually. The water should then be allowed to boil v^ 
gently till the meat is tender, 

Comed t>eef may be served hot or may be pressed into a 
pan, weighted, and chilled so that it can be turned out of the 
mold. Sometimes the superfluous fat is removed and the meat 
chopped before pressing. This makes a more delicate dish. 

Comed shoulder is served hot or cold. Ox tongue, whether 
corned or smoked, should be trimmed and skinned after cook- 
ing, and served cold. 

Smoked shoulder or ham should be skinned, sprinkled with 
bread crumbs, stuck with whole cloves, and baked until brown 
{30 to 4 5 min.). It may then be served hot, with a brown sauce 
to which J glass of currant jelly has been added, or served 
cold, without sauce.

General Directions. Meat should be cleaned and all dark 
portions rejected. Use cold water and «w»«fr the soup. Where 
vegetables are required, a mixture of carrots, turnips, and 
celery is desirable {about half as much celery as of either of 
the others). Some salt may be added while meat is cooking. 
Pepper, and more salt if needed, should be added when soup 
is served. Save all meat from soup stock for made dishes. 

Soup stock. Additional ingredient: small bunch of herbs. 
Wipe meat, cut into small pieces, and have the bones cracked. 
Put the marrow, fat, bones, and meat into a kettle with the 
cold water. Let stand 30 min.; then heat slowly to boiling 
point and cook gently 4 to 6 hr, with kettle covered. Prepare 
vegetables, cut in small pieces, add to the stock, with season- 
ings, and cook i hr, longer. Strain and cool quickly. Part 
of the meat may be rolled in flour and browned in a little of 
the meat fat, to give the soup a richer color. Use as a founda- 
tion for vegetable, rice, macaroni, tomato, and other soups. 
Bones and bits of cold cooked meat may be used for a soup 
stock, but the amount of water and seasonings should in that 
case be somewhat reduced. 

Lamb broth. Use neck of Iamb or mutton. Wipe meat 
with a damp cloth and cut in small pieces. Put bones, gristle, 
and onion into the cold water and simmer gently for 2 hr. 
Cool slightly and skim off the fat or absorb it with clean brown 
paper. Strain over the meat and cook until latter is almost 
tender. Then add the rice, well washed ; boil for 20 min,, 
season, and serve.

THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 



Scoteh broth. Cook meat etc. as for Lamb broth (p. 73). 
Soak barley several hours and add it to the broth when the 
meat is added. Heat the vegetables in 2 tb. drippings or butter 
and cook in the soup until tender, adding them when broth 
from bones is strained over meat. 

White stock. Use celery only for the vegetables and buy 
knuckle of veal for the meat. Make like Soup stock (p. 73) 
without browning the meat. Use for white soups. Chicken or 
fowl may be used in place of the veal. 

Oxtail soup. Additional ingredients : \ c. salt-pork cubes, 
2 tb. butter, 2 tb, flour. Have the oxtails cut at joints. Try 
out salt pork, roll meat in flour, and brown in pork fat. Cook 
in water 4 hr,, add vegetables, using no turnip, and season 
well. Cook 1 hr, longer ; strain, cool, and remove fat. Take 
meat from bones and put back into soup. Cook butter and 
flour together till brown, add the soup, and heat. Season, if 
necessary, and serve.

Genera/ Directions. Make sauce from the butter, flour, and 
stock called for, using water if you have no stock. For lamb, 
veal, or chicken, milk may be used in place of stock. Butter 
or drippings may be used. Scrape onion for seasoning. All 
made meat dishes should be carefully prepared, and should be 
free from bone and gristle and well seasoned. 

Minced meat. Chop the meat fine. If there is no left-over 
gravy, cook the meat trimmings to make stock for the brown 
sauce. Add meat to this, simmer very gently for i min., season, 
and pour it over half slices of toast, which may or may not be 
buttered. Tomato catsup, onion juice, or any bottled meat sauce 
may be used for seasoning, and if the meat is mutton, lamb, 
veal, or chicken, a little nutmeg may be added. 

Meat liash. Beef is most suitable for warming in this way. 
Mix meat and mashed potato, season to taste ; add J the butter 
(melted), and the onion juice. Melt the rest of butter or drip- 
pings in a frying-pan ; when brown add the hash, and cook 
slowly till well browned at the bottom. Turn on a platter, with 
crust uppermost.

it may cause it to spoil quickly. Singe the bird, remove pin- 
feathers with a sharp knife, cut off the neck, leaving the skin, 
and remove oil-bag in tail ; then wash thoroughly and proceed 
as directed. 

To truss a fowl, run a skewer through each leg and wing, 
pinning it close to the body. Then tie a piece of twine to the 
■ end of one wing skewer, run it across back of fowl to the 
skewer diagonally opposite ; connect this with skewer in other 
leg, then back to the other wing. This will hold fowl in shape 
without marking the breast. Remove skewers and string 
before serving. 

Boiled fowl. Dress, clean, and truss a 4-pound fowl ; tie 
in a piece of cheesecloth, place on a trivet in a kettle, half 
surround with boiling water, cover, and cook slowly till tender, 
turning occasionally. Add salt last hour of cooking. A piece 
of salt pork boiled with the fowl gives a good flavor and may 
be sliced and served with it. Serve with Drawn-butter sauce 
(p. 29), or with White sauce (p. 30), or with chopped celeiy, 
sliced eggs, or cooked oysters added to either sauce. 

Roast diicken. Clean, singe, and wash a 4-pound chicken, 
removing pinfeathers if necessary. Dry well and stuff, using 
recipe for Stuffing (below). Sew up openings and skewer into 
shape. Sprinkle with salt. Try out chicken fat, measure 3 tb., 
and mix with 2 tb. fiour. Spread breast and legs of chicken 
with this mixture. Roast i^ hr., reducing heat of oven after 
15 min, and basting, chicken every 10 min. with chicken fat 
and hot water (2 tb. chicken fat to i c. water). Put more 
water in pan if chicken browns too fast, and use for basting if 
necessary.

FISH 

Boiled, Broiled, Baked, and Fried Fish etc. 

Source. White-fleshed fish, as cod, haddock, pike, halibut, 
flounder, etc. ; oily-fieshed fish, as salmon, herring, mackerel, 
sardines, etc. 

Food Vabie. For protein and fat. 

Cost. Variable. 

General Directions. Fish -is a useful food, on account of 
its food value as a substitute for meat and its low cost. It 
should be perfectly fresh, however, as serious illness is likely 
to result from the use of stale fish. When fresh the eyes 
should be bright, gills red, and flesh firm, and there should 
be no unpleasant odor. 

White-fleshed fish, being rather insipid, requires a well- 
seasoned sauce. 

Boiled fish. Salmon, halibut, swordfish, cod, or haddock 

may be used. Wipe fish thoroughly and, if whole, skin it if 

desired. Tie in a dean cloth or put into a wire basket. Plunge 

into boiling water, cook for 10 min. on front of stove, then 

d,:...l,CjOO^Ic 



86 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

draw back and simmer gently till done. Drain thoroughly, 
remove cloth, and serve with Egg sauce (p. 30). For a thick 
piece of fish allow 12 to 15 min. per pound; for a thin piece, 
10 min. 

Broiled fish. Haddock, cod, bluefish, mackerel, etc., may be 
broiled whole ; swordfish, halibut, and salmon should be sliced. 
Wipe fish thoroughly, put into a well-greased broiler, and cook 
over hot coals till flakes separate, turning constantly, and cook- 
ing the flesh side longest. Remove from broiler carefully, and 
season with salt, pepper, and melted butter. To broil in a gas 
stove, put broiler in a dripping-pan, and cook at some dis- 
tance from the broiler flame, turning occasionally. Cooking 
may also be done in gas oven. Fish should then be placed 
on buttered tin sheet in a dripping-pan, seasoned and covered 
with buttered crumbs, and cooked 20 to 30 min, without turning. 
Broiled fish may be served with Tartar sauce (below). 

Tartar sauce. Ingredients : 

I tb, vinegar \ tsp. salt 

I tb. lemon juice | tsp. paprika 

4 tb. melted butter Spk. cayenne pepper 

^ tsp. any prepared meat sauce 
Brown the butter slightly and then add the other ingredients. 
Heat before pouring over fish. 

Baked fish. Cod, haddock, andtluefish are most commonly 
used. Clean and wipe the fish, and fill with Stuffing (p. 83). 
Sew up fish, lay on a well-buttered fish-sheet in dripping-pan, 
brush over with melted butter or lay thin slices of salt pork on 
the fish, and add 1 c. hot water. Bake 45 to 60 min., unless 
small fish are used, when 30 min. will be sufficient. Serve with 
a gravy made from fat in pan as for Roast meal {p. 70), 
using water for the liquid, or with Parsley sauce (p. 30). 

Baked fillet of fish. Use thin slices of halibut, or swordfish, 
or cod, or haddock, skinned and boned. Place a layer of Stuff- 
ing (p. 83) between two pieces of fish, sprinkle with salt, pepper, 
and buttered crumbs, and bake in a moderate oven 30 to 45 min..

using a fish-sheet as directed for Baked fisk (p. 86), Remove 
from pan carefully and serve with White sauce (p. 30) or 
Parsley sauce (p. 30) or Tomato cream sauce (p. 31). 

SaatM fish. Use cod, haddock, or hake. Have fish cut into 
pieces for serving. Wipe, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and 
roll in corn meal. Use drippings or try out slices of salt pork. 
Have only a little fat in pan and cook fish rather slowly, turn- 
ing, that both sides may brown, and adding more fat if needed. 
If salt pork is used, garnish the platter with the crisp slices. 
Smelts, perch, and butterfish may be cooked in this way, but 
should be left whole. 

Fried fish. Ingredients: 

2 lb. haddock or cod i egg 

Salt and pepper 2 tb. milk 

Bread crumbs or com meal

General Directions. Clams should be cleaned by pressing 
out the small black portion in the soft part of the clam, care- 
fully removing bits of shell, and washing as for oysters. 
Oysters must be picked over with the fingers to find pieces of 
shell ; they should then be washed by placing in a strainer and 
pouring ^ c. cold water over them. This liquid may be added 
to the oyster liquor if strained through cheesecloth to take out 
impurities ; both may then be used if needed, but should be 
heated and skimmed before using. Clean scallops like oysters, 
but do not reserve the liquor. Lobsters are better bought whole 
and opened at home. If lobster is fresh, the tail springs into 
place quickly when bent back. Remove claws and separate body 
from tail. Crack large claws and joints, and take out meat. Cut 
the tail shell between the legs, remove meat, cut lengthwise,

Crackers may be added, and if preferred the crisp pork and 
onion need not be left in the chowder. 

Oyster stew. Scald milk and water. Prepare oysters care- 
fully. Wash them and strain the liquid through cheesecloth 
with the oyster liquor, put into a saucepan, heat, and skim ; 
add the oysters and cook gently till the edges begin to curl. 
Then add other ingredients and serve at once with oyster 
crackers. All milk may be used in place of the pint of water, 
and I qt. oysters may be used if desired.

General Directions. Prepare salads just before serving, as they 
wilt if allowed to stand long. Keep cold. Serve extra dressing 
with salad if desired. Any recipe for mayonnaise may be used, 
or a boiled dressing may be substituted. 



FATS AND OILS 97 

Vegetable salad. Use potatoes as a foundation. Cut in 
cubes ; freshen the celery and cut in small strips. Mix pota- 
toes with Butter salad dressing (p. 69) while hot, chill, and 
add celery and the other seasonings. Serve on lettuce leaves. 
Peas, beets, or other vegetables may be substituted for celery. 
If salad is a little dry, add i or 2 tb, cream or top of milk. 
Cooked mayonnaise (p, 96) may be used if preferred. 

Celery and apple salad. Pare and core apples and cut into 
small cubes. Let stand in ice water to which a little lemon 
juice has been added. Prepare celery by chopping or cutting 
it, add apple drained thoroughly, mix with the salad dressing, 
and serve at once on lettuce or without. May be served in 
apples with inside scooped out. The pulp should be used in 
the salad, 

Bird's-nest salad. Additional ingredients: I small cream 
cheese, i tb, finely chopped nuts. Use cabbage as a founda- 
tion, preparing as directed (p. 16), Mash the cheese, season, 
and make into 12 egg-shaped balls. Roll them in the chopped 
nuts. Drain cabbage thoroughly and mix with French dress- 
ing. Place on individual plates in shape of nests and put 
3 cheese balls in each. Lettuce may be used on the plates 
if desired. 

Pineapple salad. Additional ingredient : 8 maraschino 
cherries. Cut slices of canned pineapple so as to give a fan- 
shaped appearance to the outer edge. Arrange on lettuce 
leaves and season. Quarter the cherries and use for garnishing 
the slices of pineapple. Pour sweet French dressing over all. 

Egg-and-sardine salad. Additional ingredients : 8 sardines, 
8 stuffed olives. Cook eggs hard, chop whites, and rub yolks 
through a strainer. Shred the coarse leaves of lettuce and

Food Value. Contain all the food principles. 

Cost. See market prices and cost of individual items. 

General Directions. Frying: Frying is cooking food in 
enough hot fat to cover. The fat used must be inexpensive, 
as so much is required ; it should also be free from mois- 
ture, as water causes fat to spatter badly when heated to the 
high temperature required. Fats suitable for frying are lard, 
lard substitutes, drippings, etc. ; butter is undesirable because 
it is expensive and likely to spatter and burn. If food to be 
fried has not been previously cooked, the fat used should 
be hot enough to brown a bit of bread while one is count- 
ing 60. If the food has been cooked, count 40 while bread is 
browning. Reheat fat before putting in more food. When fat 
has been used for frying, it may be clarified for subsequent 
use, by cutting some slices of raw potato into it, heating slowly, 
and proceeding as for drippings. Be careful not to pour the 
sediment from the fat into the pail. 

Drippings may be prepared at home from any pieces of 
sweet meat fat, preferably beef. Cut the fat in small pieces 
and put in a deep kettle with about i in. of cold water. Heat 
slowly, stirring constantly, and cook gently till bubbling ceases. 
Cool slightly and strain through cheesecloth into a tin pail.

lOO THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Test fat as directed. Have a dripping-pan with brown paper 
in it near the stove. Fish balls and potatoes should be lifted 
from the fat with a skimmer and drained on the paper. Cro- 
quettes should be fried in a frying-basket and turned from 
that onto the paper. To shape croquettes take up i tb. of the 
mixture, roll into a ball, and then into a short cylinder. Dip 
in crumbs, in egg, and in crumbs again, before frying. The 
crumbs should be made from bread, dried in the oven, rolled 
fine, and then sifted. Dilute the egg with 2 tb. milk or water. 
Either white or yolk may be used, though less satisfactory 
than the whole egg, (This is in addition to any e^s called 
for in the list of ingredients.) A thorough coating of eggs 
and crumbs is required to hold croquettes in shape. 

Fried potatoes. Wash and pare medium-sized potatoes and 
cut in long strips about ^ in, thick. Let stand in cold water for 
J hr. ; then drain, and dry thoroughly. Fry and drain according 
to directions for Frying (p, 99). Sprinkle with salt and paprika. 

Flsli balls. Use salt hsh and cut potatoes in cubes. Keep 
fish in cold water while shredding it. Prepare the potatoes, 
put them with the fish into boiling water, and cook till potatoes 
are soft but not watery. Drain thoroughly and beat till light. 
Add seasoning and egg (well beaten), beat well, and drop by 
the spoonful into hot fat. 

Potato croquettes. Additional ingredients: i tb. chopped 
parsley, \ tsp. scraped onion. Use hot riced potato, add other 
ingredients, shape, and fry according to General Directions. 

Rice croquettes. Additional ingredients : i tb. chopped pars- 
ley, I tb, tomato catsup, X tsp, any bottled meat sauce. Use 
cold boiled rice. Mix all together, shape, and fry according 
to Cieneral Directions. 

Sweet rice croquettes. Additional ingredients : 4 tb, sugar, 
spk. nutmeg, ^ c. rice (measured before cooking). Cook rice 
in water in a double boiler till very soft. Add butter, sugar, 
salt, and egg yolk, using a little milk to moisten if mixture 
seems very dry. Shape, dip in egg and crumbs, and proceed 



FATS AND OILS roi 

as for Potato croquettes (p. loo) ; or shape in balls, making a

General Directions. Butter, lard, and water should be ice-cold, 
except for Egg paste. Handle pastry as little as possible and 
avoid using too much fiour in rolling. Lard substitutes may 
be used in place of the lard and butter, although the pastry is 
usually more satisfactory if directions are followed. 

d,:...l,CjOO^:;Ic 



102 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

Quick paste. Sift all dry ingredients into a chopping-bowl. 
Chop in the shortening, add enougli cold water to make a 
stiff dough, roll to about \ in. thick, and use at once. Suit- 
able for Meat pie (p. 79), Apple dumplings (p. 104), etc. 

Chopped paste. Mix salt and fiour, put in chopping-tray, add 
lard and butter, and chop till well mixed. Moisten to a dough 
with cold water, toss on floured cloth, pat, and roll out. Fold 
to make three layers, turn halfway round, pat, and roll out in 
long, narrow strip. Roll up like a jelly roll and cut in halves, 
using one half for each crust. Use for pies and turnovers. 
Requires a hot oven. 

Plain paste. Wash butter, pat, and form in circular piece. 
Add salt to flour and work in lard with fingers or case knife. 
Moisten to a dough with cold water. Toss on floured board, 
pat, and roll out. Lay butter in center of lower half and fold 
dough over it, turning upper half over it. Then turn right side 
of pastry over, the left side under, the butter ; pat and roll out. 
Fold so as to make three layers, turn halfway round, pat, and roll 
out; repeat; then roll as for Chopped paste (above), making roll 
short and thick. Use for pies, turnovers, or tarts. Pastry may 
be used at once or folded in cheesecloth or waxed paper and 
placed in cold place, not on ice. Requires a rather hot oven. 

Egg paste. Put butter and boiling water in a saucepan over 
the fire ; when it boils add fiour and salt, and stir until mixture 
leaves sides of pan, keeping it over the heat. Then turn mix- 
ture into a bowl, cool, and beat in the unbeaten yolk of i egg; 
when smooth add i whole egg and continue beating until the 
paste is smooth, 

Chotc cases. Cut six rounds of paste from Quick paste (above) 
with a large-sized cooky-cutter and pipe Egg paste around the 
edges of these, using a pastry bag. Bake in a moderate oven 
till brown. Use as cases for creamed fish or meat, prepared 
as directed for Scalloped meat (p. 36) or Scalloped fish (p, 36}, 
omitting the crumbs. Trimmings left from pies may be used 
for the rounds of paste.

General Directions. Apple pie. Apricot pie, and Mock mince 
pie will require upper and under crusts, the other pies only an 
under crust and rim. Either paste may be used, as preferred. 
Roll the two crusts separately about \ in. thick, keeping the 
paste as nearly round as possible. Cut paste somewhat larger 
than the pie-plate and fit it in loosely to allow for shrinking. 
Put in the under crust, brush with white of egg (to prevent 
filling from soaking into it), and make an edge with strips of 
the paste, holding them in place by moistening the top of each 
layer with cold water. Fill the pie and put on the top crust ; 
press edges together lightly and cut slits in the crust to let 
steam escape. 2 to 3 c. fruit will generally be needed for i pie. 

d,:...l,CjOO^:;Ic 



104 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

For a pie with under crust only, build up the edges with strips 
of paste to make it the required depth. Whenever possible, if 
the filling does not require a long cooking, bake the pastry- 
shell over an inverted pie-plate, pricking it many times with 
a fork to prevent the formation of air bubbles, then fill and 
finish cooking, 

Apple dumplings. Use rule for Quick paste (p. io2). Roll 
out the dough and cut in six equal pieces, as nearly square as 
possible. Wash, pare, and core the apples, put one in the center

CANNING AND PRESERVING 

By careful preparation and sterilization, fruits and vegetables 
may be cooked in their season and kept for winter use by 
being sealed tightly in glass jars. 

Canning implies the use of little or no sugar. Sound fruit 
and vegetables, not overripe, should be selected. Wash and 
prepare according to kind, remove imperfections, and pack in 
sterilized jars. If vegetables are used, add i tb. salt for each 
pint jar, and fill to overflowing with cold water. Put on the 
covers, but do not use rubbers or fasten the clamp at first. 
Set jars on a rack in a large boiler of cold water, cover closely, 
bring to boiling point, and boil I hr. Remove jars from water 
and clamp on the cover. Repeat the cooking process for 2 days 
in succession, being careful to unclamp covers while cooking. 
At the third cooking the covers should be removed quickly, 
just before the jars are put back into the cold water, and rub- 
bers, dipped in boiling water, placed on them. This method 
is called intermittent sterilization, and food so prepared keeps 
well, as both spores and bacteria are destroyed. Tomatoes may 
be stewed, then canned as above, without water. If fruit is used, 
pack it into the jars after preparing and weighing it, and fill 
the jars with sirup instead of cold water. The amount of sirup 
to make may be determined by allowing ^ to | lb. sugar to 
each pound of fruit according to its sweetness, and 2 c. water 
for each pint jar. Sirup should be boiled from 5 to 10 min. 
before being added to the fruit. 

Two precautions should be observed in this method of can- 
ning — the jars should always be put on to heat in water of 
the same temperature as the contents of the jar, and they 
should not touch during the cooking process. 



I ro THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

To sterilize jars wash, fill with cold water, place on a rack 
in a pan containing enough cold water almost to cover them, 
bring to boihng point, and boil 15 miq. Do not empty till 
ready to fill with fruit. Covers also should be sterilized. 

Preserving requires more sugar than canning. The fruit 
should be washed and prepared as for canning, and a sirup 
made, allowing ^ to r lb. sugar for each pound of fruit and only 
enough water to dissolve the sugar. Cook the fruit in this 
sirup till tender and seal in sterilized jars as in canning. 

Hard pears, quinces, etc., are better if cooked in clear water 
till almost tender, as long cooking with sugar tends to harden 
the fruit. Use the water in which they were cooked for 
making the sirup. 

JELLY-MAKHTG 

General Directions. Wash fruit, cut in small pieces, and if 
hard fruits like apples and crab apples are used, almost cover

coarse sieve, then put in jelly bag and drain overnight. Allow 
equal amounts of juice and sugar. Boil juice 20 min. Heat

FOOD FOR INVALIDS 

In preparing food for invalids or convalescents, the instruc- 
tions of a physician should be obtained and carefully followed. 
Diets may be classified as follows : 

1. Fluid diet 

2. Light soft diet 

3. Soft, or convalescent, diet 

4. Special diets 

In general the first is suitable for patients with slight fever, 
the second for those who may have very easily digested solid 
food, the third for convalescents, the fourth for patients who 
must omit some one class of foodstuffs entirely. 

All should be daintily and attractively served, in small 
amounts.

SELECTION OF FOOD 

HOW TO PLAN HEALS 

In the choice of food for an individual or a group of people, 
there is great need of an understanding of the properties of 
food and the work which it must do in the body. The classi- 
fication of food has been given elsewhere ; its selection and 
combinations only will be considered here. 

It is frequently said that appetite is the best guide in the 
choice of food for the individual. That is probably true of 
a normal appetite, but most appetites have become so perverted 
by misuse that it is not safe to trust entirely to them. Two 
points, then, must be borne in mind in planning the daily 
dietary : first, that food must be of good quality, well prepared, 
attractively served, and wisely combined, in order to please 
the eye and palate and so stimulate digestion ; second, that it 
must meet the needs of those for whom it is prepared, both 
as to quantity and composition. 

To fulfill the first two requirements is easy. Buy the best 
that can be obtained (not always the most expensive, but that 
which is seasonable and of high grade), then prepare according 
to methods 'which have proved satisfactory. Food out of season 
is always an extravagance and is often of inferior quahty. 

Attractive serving depends on the fact that the eye governs 
the taste and that food which is unattractive in appearance is 
distasteful and therefore indigestible. Avoid overdecoration, 
though a slight garnishing adds greatly to the eesthetic value 
of many dishes. Slices of lemon, pimientos, stuffed olives, 
hard-cooked eggs, shredded lettuce, watercress, parsley, or 



138 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

any greens suggested by one's ingenuity may be used to gar- 
nish savory dishes, while whipped cream (dehcately colored), 
candied cherries, angelica, chopped nuts, etc., are suitable for 
cakes and desserts. Be careful that greens which may wilt are 
not used on hot dishes, and remember that whipped cream 
liquefies on hot desserts. 

To obtain variety serve only a few kinds of food at a meal, 
but vary the selection for each meal. Once a day is enough to 
use meat in most families ; in its place fish and the various 
meat substitutes may be included in the luncheon menu, while 
eggs, salt fish, baked beans, or a hearty cereal (such as whole 
oatmeal or cracked wheat, served with plenty of milk) may re- 
place it for breakfast. If a starchy vegetable is desired for two 
meals, use potatoes for one and rice, macaroni in its various 
forms, hominy, or sweet potatoes for the other. Where a sec- 
ond vegetable is desired, choose a succulent one, such as greens, 
asparagus, onions, turnips, or carrots for a hot dish and cucum- 
bers, lettuce, tomatoes, celery, or cabbage for a cold dish. Avoid 
vegetables similar in flavor or texture ; even the color should be 
different, except at a formal meal, which may carry out a color 
scheme. When meat is served with gravy, a second sauce 
should not accompany the vegetables, nor should two creamed 
dishes be used at the same meal. 

Bread in some form, butter, and a beverage are permissible 
at all meals, but while coffee and tea have no food value except 
for the milk and sugar added, cocoa is distinctly nourishing 
and should only be used to increase the nutritive value of a 
meal. When the first course is soup, no beverage' should be 
served except a small cup of after-dinner coffee, as too large an 
amount of liquid weakens the power of the gastric juice to 
digest the solid foods. 

It is probably true that it is impossible, under normal con- 
ditions, to serve too many fresh fruits and vegetables if care is 
taken to select them wisely and to have the diet otherwise 
balanced. Our common habit of beginning a meal with fruit 

d,:...l,CjOO^:;Ic 



SELECTION OF FOOD 1 39 

stimulates the digestive system and puts it into condition to 
receive the foods more difficult of digestion. The same is true 
of the use of hot soup. On the other hand, we place sweets at 
the end of a meal in order that they may leave a pleasant sen- 
sation and excite the flow of the gastric juice; they should not, 
however, be used for this purpose at the beginning of a meal, 
since they are so satisfying as to lessen the desire for more 
nourishing food. And while an excessive use of relishes and 
condiments is not to be recommended, they, also, undoubtedly 
serve much the same purpose, since highly seasoned food 
increases the secretion of the digestive juices. Thus many of 
our common practices have a physiological basis which we 
cannot afford to ignore in the choice of our food. 

Yet it is also true that many of our eating habits are bad. 
Sugar on rice used as a vegetable, butter for seasoning fat 
meats, oil dressings or rich sauces on meat or fish, sirup on 
griddlecakes, ice cream as a sauce for pies, whipped cream on 
chocolate, bonbons during a meal — all may be relished by the 
epicure, but should be indulged in only by those whose diges- 
tions are excellent. And any combination is difficult to digest 
if, as in fried food or pastry, starchy materials are coated with 
fat. These should not necessarily be'wholly excluded from the 
diet, but should be served infrequently and eaten in moderation. 

For the second point to be considered in the choice of food, 
namely, that it should meet the needs of the individual as to 
quantity and composition, some standard for estimating those 
needs is essential. It is not enough that food should build and 
repair the tissues and framework of the body, it must also fur- 
nish heat to maintain the body temperature and supply energy 
for its work ; that is, it must have a caloric ^ value. And while 
the building and repairing of the tissues and framework of the 
body can be done only by protein and mineral salts respectively, 

' A calorie is the unit by which heat is measured. It is commonly reckoned 
as the amount of heat required to raise one kilogram of water one degree 



d,:...l,CjOO^:;Ic 



140 THE PRACTICAL COOKBOOK 

all foods except mineral salts may yield heat. Protein and carbo- 
hydrates supply 4 calories per gram, while fats and oils furnish 
9 calories per gram. Protein should not be depended on too 
largely as a source of energy, not only because it is generally 
an expensive source of heat, but because the body can care for 
only a moderate amount of it. From one eighth to one tenth 
of the amount of heat required by the body may generally be 
furnished by the protein in the diet without harm. Scientists 
have demonstrated that an average daily need is for food that 
will supply 2400 to 3500 calories, the smaller amount being 
required by a woman at light muscular work, the larger by a 
man at moderately active muscular work. Age and sex modify 
the requirement, which is reduced by a sedentary occupation 
and increased by vigorous out-of-door life. Children under 
sixteen require from three tenths to eight tenths of the larger 
number of calories. 

Dr. Langworthy says in the Scientific Monthly for March, 
rgr6 : 

A consideration of the results of American experiments and other data 
has led us to conclude that, with our ordinary food habits, involving, as they 
do, the use of a considerable variety of foods in reasonably liberal quantities, 
one is justified for many purposes in discussing dietetics on a basis of 
energy only, since a diet which supplies 3000 to 3500 calories of energy 
per man per day, as ours very commonly does, almost inevitably supplies 
the needed protein, ash, and other constituents also. Particularly is this 
the case when one takes pains to include in the diet a reasonable amount 
of milk, green vegetables, and fruit.' 

The daily menus given at the end of this section are based 
on the needs of a man requiring 3500 calories per day, giving 
due consideration to the inclusion in those menus of a proper 
amount of each foodstuff, namely, protein, fat, starch, sugar, 
and ash (mineral salts). To supply the latter the housekeeper 

' The reader is referred to a reprint of this article issued by the Journal of 
Homf Economics, Baltimore, Md., for further valuable information; also to a . 
publication of the American School of Home Economics, Chicago, III, entiUed 
" Food Values," which gives an excellent list of loo-calorie portions. 



L>,,...L,C.oo8lc 



SELECTION OF FOOD 141 

must know their chief sources. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen 
are present in all foods, while nitrogen and sulphur are found 
in all protein, so these are easily supplied in the diet. A liberal 
supply of milk, eggs, and cheese will furnish calcium and phos- 
phorus, the latter being also abundant in whole grains and 
vegetables. Sodium is largely used, being one of the ingredi- 
ents of common salt and also being found in many vegetables. 
Chlorine is supphed by common salt. Vegetable foods, espe- 
cially spinach and prunes, are valuable sources of iron, while 
entire wheat contains both iron and magnesium, which is also 
present in cocoa, chocolate, dried beans, almonds, walnuts, pea- 
nuts, and oatmeal. Dried beans and peas, figs, dates, prunes, 
raisins, cocoa, and most add fruits furnish a relatively large 
amount of potassium. 

For further assistance in arranging a family dietary, the food 
values given for each group of recipes may be consulted. No 
one meal need include all the foodstuffs if all are represented 
in the menus for the day. It is likewise true of the daily cal- 
oric need that a slight lack on one day may be made up by a 
corresponding increase on the next. 

The menus which follow may be modified to suit the needs 
of one or more individuals. By way of contrast with the well- 
balanced meals are given three examples of meals containing 
an excess of the food principle indicated, in the hope that they 
may assist in the avoidance of such mistakes.
