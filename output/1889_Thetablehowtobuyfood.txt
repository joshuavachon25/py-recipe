THE TABLE. 



THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE. 



THE pleasures of the table are enjoyed by all who possess good health. 
Nothing is more fascinating than to be seated at a well-served, well- 
cooked breakfast or dinner; and yet, of the immense number that 
enjoy the good cheer and luxuries of the table, how few, very few, 
there are who stop to consider the vexatious trouble our host undergoes 
when arranging the daily bill of fare. "Variety is the spice of life," 
but nowhere is it more important, aye, actually necessary, than in the 
getting up of a palatable meal. This pertains not only to the dining-room 
of a hotel of the least pretensions or to the so-called " grand" restaurant, 
but particularly to the family table. The writer has known a gentle- 
man who presided over an immense restaurant, and daily provided the 
supplies therefor. He experienced no difficulty with any single part of 
his business, yet when he came to arrange the details of his own family's 
meals, and attempted to practically fulfill them, he was puzzled and 
annoyed beyond description. And, after all, there is no place in the civil- 
ized world where the market for the supply of food is so well provided 
as in New York, both as to variety and excellence, and even as to luxu- 
ries. Educated as thousands of persons have been, in the art of dining, 
by the famous Delmonico and his able lieutenants, New York, perhaps, 
contains a larger number of so-called high-livers than any other city. 

These " gourmands" (if you please), and their number is legion, have, 
with the aid of the excellent resources of the American market and the 
encouragement given to the culinary art of the period, brought the modern 
American table to virtual perfection. This is saying a great deal, inas- 
much as the famed restaurants of London, Paris, and Vienna have ever 
claimed a reputation and an ascendancy over others that seemed to form 
a part of history itself. 

But as times change, so we change with them. Westward the course 
of Empire sways, and the great glory of the past has departed from those 



THE TABLE. 



centres where the culinary art at one time defied all rivals. The sceptre 
of supremacy has passed into the hands of the great metropolis of the 
New World. It has been the writer's good fortune to gain experience on 
this subject from his observations in Europe as well as in this country. 
He can state, without fear of contradiction, that more first-class, well-fatted, 
and corn-fed cattle reach the markets of New York, than any other market 
of the United States. Whenever a first-class article of beef is required by 
one of the inland hotels, they send to New York for it. 

Ask the ordinary traveler, and he will tell you that a first-class steak, 
an "A i " chop, or prime roast beef is a rara avis in hotels outside 
of New York. London has excellent mutton and good beef; that is all. 
Paris gives plenty of variety, but it is all of an inferior quality with the 
exception of veal, which is good. The same may be said of northern 
Germany, where, in addition, the larger hotels in Hamburg and Bremen 
are able to supply good steaks, the cattle in that country being of fine 
quality. 

Yet no American, accustomed to his prime beef at New York, can be 
pleased at any of these continental hotels, as he loses sight of his favorite 
roast and steak. 

At the extensive cattle yards of Berlin, which are under control of an 
excellent administration, and perfectly arranged, it was impossible, for 
instance, on a well-supplied market day to find a single dozen corn-fed 
young steers that would make good enough beef for first-class custom in 
New York. The bulk of cattle offered for sale was made up of oxen 
that had been overworked they had horns bigger than themselves and 
the remainder were old cows and bulls. 

Of the bovine family, the branch most celebrated for the good quality 
of beef is the Durhams or Shorthorns. It is only fifty years ago that 
the first were imported to this country from England, and so well have 
they prospered and multiplied that the finest and best specimens of the 
race are now found in these United States. They are now freely exported, 
at large prices, to the mother-country, where they are highly prized for 
breeding purposes. There are farms in Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, 
and even in Missouri and Kansas, that turn out annually from 300 to 1,000 
head of fatted, corn-fed cattle, from two to four years old, and weighing 
from 1,500 to 2,500 pounds per head. 

As to mutton, this country is already beginning to occupy a position 
second to none. We may probably not as yet surpass England in this 
respect, but we have learned a great deal on this subject during the past 
thirty years; hence the American breed of sheep has considerably 
improved. The quality and flavor of our mutton is improving to that 
extent that a long time cannot possibly elapse before the prejudice now 
existing in favor of the English article must give way to the honest 
acknowledgment that the American mutton, if not superior to, stands at 
least fully on a par with, the English rival. 

Our farmers and agriculturists have learned a great deal on this ques- 
tion. They now know that, as to early lambs, for instance, the ewes 



THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE. 



should be strong, and kept in good condition, so that they can supply the 
lambs with plenty of milk. They are now kept in a warm barn where the 
cold winds do not touch them, and where the sun can shine on them. 
They commence feeding them by putting a little bran in the lamb's mouth, 
so that it can taste it, and the lambs commence eating from a box 
separate from the sheep. They generally feed them with cracked corn or 
meal, and sometimes oats and corn ground together, with plenty of milk 
from the ewes. If kept in good order and well fed, they will be ready 
for market, by the time they are six to eight weeks old. After the month 
of June, lambs come from New York State mostly from Dutchess County. 
They are turned out to graze on the hills, where some cracked corn and 
meal are put in the fields, so they can eat it at their pleasure. Many of 
the late sheep and lambs come from Canada. Two of the largest sheep 
ever sold in New York were raised by Mr. Vail, of Dutchess County, and 
sold by A. Luyster to Mr. L. Delmonico for the sum of $100. The 
two weighed, alive, 632 Ibs., and dressed, 420 Ibs. 

One of the leading questions that directly affects the American cuisine 
is the contest now progressing as to the transportation of animal food to 
the great Eastern markets. Heretofore live cattle were transported to, 
and slaughtered at, the places of consumption. This so-called home- 
slaughtering interest has within the past few years experienced great 
competition with the slaughterers of cattle in the far West, who have 
brought their meats to the Eastern market in refrigerator-cars. The 
great question now is: Which is the better way, and by which method are 
the public interests served the best, as well as the sanitary condition of 
this important article of food most improved ? 

There can be no doubt that, while this controversy lasts, the consumer 
has already been benefited, and the transportation of live cattle has already 
been greatly facilitated and improved. The quality of the meat does not 
depend upon the place where the animal is slaughtered, but it does depend 
upon the stafe of the animal's health when it is slaughtered. Let the 
cattle-cars be improved so that cattle can be transported without being 
knocked about and bruised, and let them be properly fed and watered 
while in transit; after making the long journey from the far West, let 
them be well rested and cooled off before slaughtering. 

The Western dressed-beef men will also have to be on their mettle in 
order to meet the exigencies of the times. Let them keep their wild 
prairie cattle and their scalawags out of the better markets, handle their 
beef carefully, keep it subjected to a uniform temperature of about 38* 
Fahrenheit, discard all artificial preservative means, and all opponents to 
their interests will be bereft of argument. 



THE TABLE. 



OUR MARKETS. 



OUR markets contain an abundant supply of poultry and game of an 
exceptionally fine quality. For superior and palatable chickens 
we are recommended to those raised about the creameries of New 
Jersey. The hand-fed geese and ducks of Rhode Island rival in flavor 
and delicacy the celebrated Caneton-de-Rouen, while the American tur- 
keys are famous the world over. To give any adequate idea of the quan- 
tity of game which comes from the vast feeding-grounds of this country, 
or to enumerate substantially every form in which, during the different 
seasons, game appears in market, would require too much space. 

No game is more highly prized or more eagerly sought after in Europe 
than our American canvas-back ducks, grouse and wild turkeys. It has 
become part of our history that during the late war twenty thousand 
turkeys were shipped by one firm in New York City to supply a Thanks- 
giving dinner to an army ; while at present so plentiful is the supply that 
but a few days would be required to secure double that number. 

Near Rhode Island, on one farm of about fifty acres, twenty thou- 
sand geese, and as many ducks, are fattened annually for market. In 
Vermont and other cold localities during December, when turkeys are 
full grown and fattest, hundreds of tons of them are dressed, frozen hard 
in boxes, and preserved in that condition for use in the spring and sum- 
mer months; when freshly killed, turkeys are tough and unpalatable. 
Unless well experienced, the purchaser would do better to leave the 
selection of poultry and game to some reliable dealer, rather than depend 
upon " signs," which are at times deceiving. 

Spring chickens appear in market about May ; those hatched in incu- 
bators come somewhat earlier. They are very small, weighing about a 
pound each, and improve in flavor and richness as they increase in size. 
Tender chickens may be had almost the whole year, but they are not 
plentiful during the spring months. 

Capons are good from December until April. 

Young turkeys are first killed in September ; they are full grown and 
fattest in December, and remain good until spring, when they are super- 
seded by frozen turkeys. 

Geese and ducks are first brought to market in June, and, if they have 
been properly fed, are a great delicacy. They may be had through the 
summer, autumn, and winter months. Geese are called "green" until 
they are three or four months old. 

Guinea-fowls are best in summer and autumn, when young and fat. 

Squabs are in market the whole year. 



OUR MARKETS. 



The laws for killing and selling game vary somewhat in the different 
States, and sometimes in the different counties of the same State. Refer- 
ence is made principally in regard to the New York City markets. So 
great are the facilities for forwarding quickly by rail and steamer, that 
supplies of game are easily obtained from long distances ; and birds killed 
in southern Texas, or other remote places, may be served perfectly fresh 
on New York tables a few days later. The flight of birds is greatly 
controlled by the weather. An early or late season, or a wet or dry one, 
or even a cold wave, may hasten or retard them, and make game plentiful 
or scarce, fat or poor ; but an abundant supply of all kinds of game in its 
best condition is generally to be had in the months it is in season, as 
follows : 

Ruffed grouse, commonly called partridges, are in season from Sep- 
tember i to February i. 

Pinnated grouse, commonly called prairie-chickens, from September 
I to February i. 

Quails, from November i to February i. 

Woodcock are in the market from August i to February i, and are 
fattest in October. 

English snipe appear in the spring, and again in the autumn, when they 
are in their best condition, and are to be had in smaller quantities during 
the winter. 

Yellow-legged snipe, robin or red-breasted snipe, dowicher and black- 
breasted or winter snipe, also common snipe, are abundant in the spring, 
and again from July through October, when they are best. 

Upland, grass, or gray plover are in market through the spring and 
summer months, and are fattest in August and September. 

Doe-birds are to be had a* about the same time. They are plover of a 
larger size, and are considered not inferior to any other. 

Golden plover, or frost-birds, are plentiful in the spring, and are in fine 
condition in September and October. 

Sora, or Virginia rail, are best in September and October. 

Reed-birds, or rice-birds, become very fat in August and September. 
When found among the reeds of New Jersey they are called reed-birds, 
and rice-birds when from the wild rice-fields of the South. 

Rabbits and hares are in season from November i to February i. 

Venison is in market from August i to January i only, and is good 
during that time. 

Antelope may be generally had through the autumn and winter 
months. 

Wild pigeons appear in the spring and autumn, but no longer in such 
immense numbers as formerly. It is only possible to obtain them for 
market when their " nestings" are near a railroad, which facilitates their 
quick shipment. The young birds (wild squabs), taken from the nest, 
make a most delicious broil. 

Wild ducks, swan, geese, and brant are in season from September r 
to May i. The choicest of these are: canvas-back, mallard, teal, red-

head, widgeon, wood, brant, cygnet or young swan, goose when young 
and fat. 

English pheasants, English hares, and Scotch grouse are to be found 
in the New York markets in excellent condition during the winter months. 

The wild mongrel goose, which appears in our markets about Christ- 
mas-time, is, like the canvas-back duck, considered as one of the greatest 
luxuries, and exclusively American. 

The far-famed canvas-back duck is also an exclusively North American 
species. Closely resembling in appearance and habits the red-head of 
America and the pochard of Europe, it is still quite distinct from and 
superior to both these species in the excellence of its flesh. It is found 
throughout North America, from the Arctic Ocean to Central America, on 
the interior waters and on both shores. Chesapeake Bay is the most 
noted ground for canvas-back ducks in the country, but they are espe- 
cially abundant in Southern California. They breed on the ponds, rivers, 
and lakes, from Oregon to the more extreme northern portions of the con- 
tinent. The canvas-back is without doubt the most sought after and 
widely known of all our ducks, and in localities where it can obtain the 
root of the Vallisneria spiralis (called by some tape-grass, and by others, 
incorrectly, wild celery), the food to which it owes the peculiarly delicate 
flavor for which it is so famous. As a highly prized delicacy, it stands 
without a rival. When, however, it is obliged to content itself with a diet 
chiefly of animal food, or is not properly handled in the kitchen, it becomes 
merely a very ordinary table bird. The Vallisneria is not found on the 
Pacific Coast, but in many parts of the interior, and especially in the 
Chesapeake Bay. The canvas-back being an excellent and strong diver, 
brings from the bottom the Vallisneria by the roots ; these it bites off and 
swallows, while the red-head, black-head, and other ducks feed on the refuse 
grass, or occasionally a root snatched from the canvas-back. At times 
the water is covered with grass thus pulled up. By the middle of Decem- 
ber the canvas-back becomes so fat as to have been known to burst open 
in the breast in falling on the water. In New Orleans it is called " canard 
cheval." The canvas-back is covered somewhat like the red-head, but 
there is no reason for the confusion which exists in the minds of so many 
people regarding the two species. A careful comparison of the following 
descriptions of the two birds will indicate well-marked differences by 
which they may always be distinguished. The cook of a Buffalo gentle- 
man, when asked if she knew the difference between a red-head and a 
canvas-back replied, "To be sure! one has the head of a fool!" (meaning 
the canvas-back).

Iris yellow. 

The weight of a pair of good 
fat red-head ducks with feathers 
on will average five pounds. 

The red-head duck is found in greater or less numbers throughout 
North America, on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, breeding in high north- 
ern latitudes, and frequenting in winter the southern portions of the con- 
tinent as far as Mexico. The red-head is not common on the coasts of 
New England. During the winter months it abounds considerably al-ong 
the south shore of Long Island, and is extremely abundant from this 
point south, especially at Chesapeake Bay and Currituck. Its flesh is 
excellent and when it is enabled to feed on the well-known Vallisneria is 
almost fully equal in point of flavor to that of the canvas-back. The diet 
of the red-head is by preference vegetable, but in default of a sufficiency 
of food of this nature, they will, like other ducks, eat frogs, tadpoles, and 
various mollusks. In the West they feed largely on corn and wheat, 
which they glean from the fields, and on wild oats, the seed of the water- 
lily, and roots and leaves of other aquatic plants. 



THE TABLE. 



VARIETIES OF FISH TO BE FOUND IN 

THE MARKETS DURING THE 

DIFFERENT MONTHS. 



JANUARY. 

Live codfish \Gadus morrhua~\. Haddock \Melamogramus agle finus\. 
Cusk \Brosmius brosme\ ; this belongs to the cod family, and although 
very little known, is an excellent table fish. Hake \Phycis chuss\ ; this is 
another of the codfish family, but inferior to any of the other varieties. 
Halibut \Hypoglossus -vulgaris}. Small chicken halibut \Hypoglossus vul- 
garis}. Striped bass \Roccus lineatus}. Eels \_Arguilla vulgaris\. Lobsters 
\_Homarus Americanus\\ very scarce, and in poor condition. Fresh salmon 
\Oncorhynckus chouichd\ ; these salmon are caught in the Columbia River, 
Oregon, all the year round, and are shipped in refrigerator-cars, and 
received daily in the New York markets. Frozen salmon [Salmo salar\\ 
caught in the Restigouche River in July, and kept in freezers. Turbot 
\Platysomatichthys hippoglossoides\, coming from Newfoundland, are occa- 
sionally in market during this month. Frost-fish, sometimes called torn- 
cods \_Microgdus tomcod\. Frozen fresh mackerel [Scomber scombrus]. 
Frozen Spanish-mackerel [Scomber omarus], Pompano [Trachynotus caro- 
linus] ; a few occasionally in market, coming from Pensacola, Florida. 
Red-fish, or channel bass \Scioena ocellata], caught in Florida. Sheep's-head 
\Diplodus pobatocephahis\ from Florida. Grouper \Epinephelus moriq^, 
from Pensacola ; a very good fish for boiling, somewhat like the red- 
snapper, but the meat is of a finer grain. Red-snapper [Lutjanus Black- 
fordii\ has become a staple article in our markets during the winter. 
They weigh from two pounds upward, as much as twenty pounds each. 
It is good either boiled or baked, but most epicures prefer it baked. In 
selecting a fish, care should be taken not to buy one that weighs over eight 
pounds, as anything larger than that is apt to be tough and lacking in 
flavor. Shad [Clupea sopidisima], caught in the St. John's River, in Florida, 
are to be had nearly every day during this month. Frozen bluefish 
[Pomatomus saltatrix\, preserved by being kept in freezers since the pre- 
vious fall. Herring [Clup'ea harengus\ from Nova Scotia. Skate, or ray- 
fish [Plerroplatea maclura]. The demand for this fish increases every year. 
The American people begin to appreciate its many excellences. Probably 
the annual dinners of the Ichthyophagous Club, at which this fish is 
always served, have materially increased the popularity and demand for 
this fish. Rainbow trout [Salmo irrided]. These fish were first marketed 
during the winter of 1885 and 1886, and they are one of the notable exam- 



VARIETIES OF FISH, 



pies of fish-culture, as the following brief history will show. Six years 
ago Professor Spencer F. Baird, then Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries 
for the United States, received a lot of eggs of the rainbow trout from 
California. He presented five hundred of them to the South Side Club, 
who have one of the most complete fish-cultural establishments in this 
State. These eggs were hatched and the fish raised in the preserves of 
the Club, where they increased to such an extent that the Club decided to 
send their surplus to market, and they have become very popular, and 
sell readily at one dollar and twenty-five cents per pound. The open 
season for these trout is from April to September. Salmon-trout, frozen 
[Salvelimis namaycusJi\. Whitefish, frozen [Coregonus dupeiformis\. Pick- 
erel \Esox reticulatus\ weighing from half a pound to ten pounds each, 
are very good during the winter months. Wall-eyed pike [Sticostedium 
vitreuni\. Catfish {Ictalurtis punctatus]. Smelts [Osmerus mordax} are 
received from different parts of the East and North during this month. 
The choicest come from Maine and Massachusetts! Those coming from 
Canada are always frozen, and are inferior, and sold at a very low price. 
Green turtle. Diamond-back terrapin. Prawns, from South Carolina. 
Scallops. Oysters. The following are the best in this month : Blue 
Points, Shrewsbury s, East Rivers, and Mill Ponds. Hard crabs. Crab- 
meat, fresh picked. Whitebait. Finnan haddie. Smoked salmon. 
Smoked halibut. Best boneless dried codfish. 

FEBRUARY. 

Live codfish. Haddock. Halibut. Striped bass. Eels. Live lob- 
sters. Fresh salmon. Frost-fish. Fresh Spanish-mackerel are found 
occasionally in market, coming from Pensacola, Florida. Pompano. 
Sheep's-head. Red-fish, or channel bass. Grouper. Red-snapper. White 
perch [Rocctis Americanus}, from Long Island ; one of the best pan-fish 
that is found in market. Smelts, green, from Maine, Massachusetts, and 
Rhode Island, and frozen smelts from Canada. During the latter part of 
the month very choice smelts are received from Long Island. These fish 
are large, and are considered the best of all varieties of smelts received. 
Shad. During the latter part of the month they begin to come from North 
Carolina. These fish are oftentimes large, weighing six pounds each, and 
in flavor are equal to those taken in the Connecticut River. Herring. 
Skate, or ray-fish. Salmon-trout. Whitefish. Yellow perch [Perca Amer- 
icana]. Pickerel. Wall-eyed pike. Catfish. Green turtle. Terrapin. 
Prawns. Scallops. Oysters. Codfish tongues. Soft shell crabs during 
this month are in excellent condition, and are considered one of the most 
seasonable shell fish in market at this time. Hard crabs. Whitebait. 
Crab-meat, fresh picked. Finnan haddie. Smoked salmon. Boneless 
dried codfish. Smoked halibut. 

MARCH. 

Live codfish. Haddock. Halibut. Striped bass. Chicken Halibut. 
Eels. Live lobsters. Salmon, from the Columbia River. During the 



IO THE TABLE. 



latter part of the month a few fish are received from Nova Scotia, weigh- 
ing about eight pounds each, and are called Kennebec salmon by the 
tradesmen, although no salmon are caught either in the Penobscot or 
Kennebec rivers, Maine, until about the ist of May. Large flounders 
[Pseudopleuronectes Americanus], suitable for making fillet of sole. Spanish- 
mackerel. Pompano. Sheep's-head. Red-snapper. Grouper. Shad are 
abundant this month from North Carolina, and about the 25th or 3Oth of 
March they make their first appearance in the North or Hudson River. 
Herring. Skate, or ray-fish. Sturgeon \Acipencer sturio\. Salmon-trout. 
Whitefish. Yellow perch. Pickerel. C\sco[Coregonus artedi]. Catfish. Wall- 
eyed pike. Green turtle. Terrapin. With the month of March closes the 
terrapin season, as after the ist of April it seems to be univerally con- 
ceded that the weather is too warm, and terrapin are not relished, nor 
does the palate crave them. Soft shell clams are still excellent this month. 
Prawns. Scallops. Oysters. Those known as East Rivers, caught on 
the north shore of Long Island, are considered best in this month. Crab- 
meat, fresh picked. Smoked haddock. Smoked salmon. Smoked halibut. 
Smoked mackerel. 

APRIL. 

Live codfish. Haddock. Halibut. Striped bass. Chicken halibut. 
Eels. Live lobsters. Tomcods. Salmon, fresh from the Columbia River. 
Salmon, fresh from Nova Scotia. Flounders. White perch. Fresh mack- 
erel. About the first part of April mackerel make their appearance on 
our coast, oftentimes in enormous numbers, and are sold in the markets 
at prices so low as to make them the cheapest food of the season. Span- 
ish-mackerel and pompano are occasionally in the market from Pensacola, 
Florida. Kingfish [Mentidrrus nebulosus\ ; a few come into market from 
North Carolina. Sheep's-head, from North Carolina. Smelts ; with the 
close of this month the fish goes out of season. Red-snapper are to be 
found in market up to the isth of April. Sea bass [Serranus atrarius] ; 
a few occasionally come into market from Charleston, S. C. Shad increase 
in abundance from the North and Hudson rivers. Skate, or ray-fish. 
Bluefish \Pomatomus saltatrix] ; a few make their appearance, caught on 
the Florida coast. Brook-trout [Salvelinus fontinalis]. The open season 
for this fish commences April i. Salmon-trout. Whitefish. Pickerel. 
Cisco. Wall-eyed pike. Catfish. Green turtle. Prawns. Crayfish [As- 
tacus fluviatilus~\ are found during this month in the markets ; they are 
caught in the Potomac River. Scallops ; with the close of this month 
they are out of season. Oysters are generally better during the month of 
April than at any other time of the year, but, according to custom, with 
the close of this month the oyster season ends. Fresh frogs' legs during 
the latter part of this month are taken, and begin to make their appear- 
ance in market at prices of about sixty to seventy-five cents per pound. 
Codfish tongues. Hard crabs. Crab-meat. Whitebait. Smoked had- 
dock. Smoked salmon. Smoked halibut. 



VARIETIES OF FISH. \ \ 



MAY. 

Codfish during this month is apt to be poor, as no live fish are 
brought to the New York markets. It is mostly fish caught off Nan- 
tucket and repacked in Boston, and from there shipped to New York. 
Haddock ; the same applies to this fish as to the cod. Halibut is 
in excellent condition this month, both large fish for steaks, and small 
chicken halibut for dinner fish. Striped bass. Eels. Lobsters. Black- 
fish \_Teutogo onitis]. Salmon from Restigouche make their appear- 
ance about the 2Oth of May. Oregon salmon continue to come during 
this month, although not in as good order as in previous months. 
Large flounders for fillet of sole are excellent this month. Fresh mack- 
erel. Spanish-mackerel and pompano from Pensacola, Florida. A few 
come to market from North Carolina during this month. Butter-fish 
[Stromateus triacanthus~\ make their appearance in the market this month. 
Weakfish [Cyonosdon regale} plenty and cheap. Kingfish from Long 
Island make their appearance during this month in the markets, and are 
an excellent fish, growing better each month till October, when they go 
out of season. Sheep's-head ; a few make their appearace from Long 
Island. Porgies \Stenotomtts chrysops~\, from Long Island. Sea bass during 
this month are abundant from Narragansett Bay. Shad from Connecticut 
is probably at its best this month. There is no doubt that shad from 
this river possesses a flavor superior to all others. Shad from the North 
River begin to get soft and are not in good condition. Bluefish; there are a 
few weighing one and a half to two pounds each in market. Squid [Loligo 
pealcci\ This is an article of food that Spaniards and Italians think a great 
deal of, but it is very little used by American people as yet. It has been 
introduced to the American public by the dinners of the Ichthyophagous 
Club, which is composed of a few gentlemen connected with the leading 
newspapers, and some eminent scientific men, whose object is to cultivate 
a taste and demand for those varieties of fish which are not generally sup- 
posed to be good edible food. Brook-trout under the existing law come 
into market on April I. Probably the finest flavored trout found on 
this continent are the wild brook-trout taken in the streams of Long 
Island. Cultivated brook-trout that are raised in ponds and preserves 
depend very much upon the character of their food as to what the flavor 
will be. Trout that are fed entirely upon chopped liver are usually flat 
and insipid to the taste. But trout that are fed upon small minnows or 
other fish-food, such as clams, larvae of insects, and small fish of any 
kind, are always more delicate in flavor. Salmon-trout and whitefish ; a 
few are found in market this month, but during warm weather it is very 
difficult to obtain them in New York City markets in prime condition. 
Carp {Cyprinus carpia}. These fish are now making their appearance in 
our markets in considerable quantities, having been introduced into this 
country through the instrumentality of Professor Spencer F. Baird, late 
United States Fish and Fisheries Commissioner, some eight years ago. 



12 THE TABLE. 



They have been distributed in nearly every State of the Union, and in the 
Southern States have grown larger, and are found in better condition, than 
they are in Germany, where the parent fish came from. The market is 
principally supplied now with fish caught in the Potomac River, weighing 
from two to fifteen pounds each, and are selling at present for twenty-five 
cents a pound ; but in the course of a few years there is no doubt that 
these fish will be sold for from ten to twelve cents a pound. Green turtle. 
Frogs' legs. Crayfish during this month come from Wisconsin. They 
are of very fine flavor, and are the best that are found in this country. 
Prawns from South Carolina. Crab-meat, fresh picked. Soft crabs grow 
more abundant during this month, and are in excellent condition. A very 
choice smoked fish is in season this month, called the roe herring, and by 
some of the grocers under various names, such as bloaters, Burlington 
herring, etc. 

JUNE. 

Codfish may be had, but not in good condition. Haddock may be had, 
but not in good condition. Halibut. Striped Bass. Eels. Lobsters. 
Fresh salmon from the Kennebec and Penobscot rivers, Maine, and from

month, and are to be had at the lowest price during the season, selling 
oftentimes as low as fifteen cents per pound by the whole fish. Large 
flounders for fillet of sole. Blackfish. Fresh mackerel. Pompano. Span- 
ish-mackerel. Weakfish. Butter-fish. Kingfish. Sheep's-head. Porgies.

condition, but with the close of this month go out of season. Bluefish are 
larger, sometimes weighing four to six pounds each, and are improving in 
quality. Carp. Skate, or ray-fish. Black bass \Micr -opterus dolomiei\ are 
in season from the ist of June until the ist of January. This is a very 
choice table fish; probably one of the best of the fresh water fishes.

VARIETIES OF FISH. 



a very inferior fish as compared with the Spanish-mackerel. Crevalle 
\Caranx hippos]. This fish is sometimes sold as pompano, but is a very 
inferior fish, as the pompano is one of the choicest fishes that we have in 
market. Butter-fish. Tilefish \_Lopholatilus chamaelconticeps]. This fish 
was first discovered in our waters by the United States Fish Commission 
in 1880. It is very brilliant in color, but the meat is very coarse-flaked, 
and somewhat resembling the haddock in appearance and flavor. Lafa- 
yette [Liostomus xanthurus\ a small fish weighing about a quarter of a 
pound each, and a very desirable pan-fish. Sea-robins \Prionotus palmipes\. 
This fish is found very plentifully at this season of the year in the waters 
of Long Island, and was first introduced as a table fish by the Ichthyo- 
phagous Club some five years ago. It is a very fair pan-fish. Sea bass. 
Kingfish. Sheep's-head. Porgies. Bluefish. Moonfish. Squid. Skate.

in price, and with the close of the month fresh salmon caught on the 
Atlantic coast go out of season. Large flounders for fillet of sole. Black- 
fish. Fresh mackerel. Spanish-mackerel. During this month the Spanish- 
mackerel are in their best condition, being fat and of delicate flavor. Cero 
\Scomberom0rus caballa\. A large fish, weighing from six to twenty pounds 
each, resembling the Spanish-mackerel in appearance, but not so fine 
flavored. Crevalle \Caranx hippos]. Pompano. Butter-fish. Tilefish. 
Weakfish. Lafayette. Porgies. Squid. Smelts make their appearance 
for the first time in the season during this month. Red-snapper are to be 
found in market this month, the first of the season. Grouper ; a fish 
somewhat resembling the red-snapper in form, but of a darker red color, 
and similar in flavor to the red-snapper, and by a great many people 
thought to be superior to the red-snapper. Sea bass. Skate. Bluefish 
are in better condition, and in their prime during this month. Salmon- 
trout. Pickerel. Whitefish. Catfish. Wall-eyed pike. Carp. Green 
turtle. Crayfish. Prawns. Frogs' legs. Scallops begin to come into market 
at this time, but are not quite so good as they are a month later. Hard 
crabs. Whitebait. Soft crabs are in better condition and of better flavor 
during this month than at any other time of the year. Moonfish. Butter-

OCTOBER. 

Codfish ; during the latter part of this month codfish are brought alive 
to the market. Haddock. Halibut. Striped bass. Eels. Lobsters. 
Blackfish. Columbia River salmon commence to come into market at this 
time. These salmon are what are known as the steel-head variety \Salmo 
gardneri]. They are not as fine flavored nor as much esteemed as those 
that are called chinooks, which come earlier in the season. Large

are not considered good for the table until the weather is cold, and with 
the month of October are first used on the table. Crayfish. Prawns. 
Frogs' legs. Hard crabs. Soft crabs are to be found in market usually 
up to the loth of October. White-bait. Scallops. Redfish, or spotted

Salmon-trout. Whitefish. Yellow Perch. Pickerel. Cisco. Shad. For 
the past two or three years, during the month of November, shad have 
been taken off the coast of Massachusetts in the nets along with the mack- 
erel. These shad are large, weighing five pounds each, and are very fat 
and of excellent flavor. Bluefish. This month usually closes the bluefish 
season, but during the months of December, January, and February they 
are found in market, but always are fish that have been preserved by 
freezing. Masquallonge \Esox nobilier}. This fish weighs from four to 
twenty pounds each, and is of the pickerel family, and considered the 
most superior in flavor to all the pickerels. Wall-eyed pike. Catfish.

about one-fourth of a pound each ; very sweet, and a desirable pan-fish. 
Cusk. Blackfish. Grouper. Smelts. Mullet \_Mugil albula], A Southern

brown color ; not equal in flavor to the soft crab found during the 
summer. 



VEGETABLES. 



VEGETABLES. 



VEGETABLES are grown to such an extent in the South, and also in 
hot-houses in the North, that we may enjoy, even in the coldest 
winter weather, nearly every variety. 

The growing of vegetables in the South for Northern markets received 
its impetus through an incident which happened in a then well-known 
resort in New York. A party of gentlemen, among them a steward on 
one of the Southern steamers, were seated one day in January con- 
versing, when the steward, who was in the habit of bringing mint with him 
for this particular resort, ordered a mint-julep; this order, at that time of 
the year, created a little surprise, especially to one of the party, who was 
a dealer in vegetables. However, the matter was explained, and the 
dealer arranged with the steward to bring him some mint, together with 
whatever vegetables he could get, on each of his Northern trips. The 
demand for them increased so fast that a great many growers commenced 
to raise vegetables, so that the business has grown to vast proportions. 

The following information may be useful to those who wish to know 
at what season of the year certain vegetables may be had, and also where 
they may be had in their prime. 

Asparagus. The consumption of asparagus has grown so much dur- 
ing the past few years, partly, perhaps, through the recommendation of 
physicians, that it might be well here to give an idea as to where and 
when it is grown. It first makes its appearance in market from the 
middle of February until the middle of March, according to the condition 
of the weather. 

Occasionally it may be had during the winter from hot-houses, but of 
inferior quality. The first of out-door growth comes from Charleston, 
S. C., where there are a number of very large beds, and where it is grown 
very successfully, both as to quality and quantity. It is shipped from 
there to Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, and New York, arriving at 
the latter place by express in a little less than forty-eight hours after 
cutting. Although North Carolina is growing more every year, the next 
location where it is raised in quantities for market is Norfolk, Va., the quality 
being of the best. We now reach our own vicinity Oyster Bay and New 
Jersey. The former place has long had the reputation of raising the finest 
asparagus, but as a great many of their beds are getting old, and not 
receiving the proper attention, they are fast losing their prestige to 
Jersey, where they are growing more and more every year, and of the 
very finest quality. Asparagus may be had at its best from the ist of 
May, until the ist of June; after this time it commences to run out until 
July first, when cutting is stopped. The demand has been so great for 



1 6 THE TABLE. 



the past few years that, although more and more is raised every year, the 
price advances instead of getting less, and for the large " Colossal " or 
" Delmonico " asparagus immense prices are paid. 

French artichokes may be had all the year round; the quality and 
size depend on the condition of the weather during their growth. Most 
of the supply is from France, but occasionally from California and the 
South. 

Jerusalem artichokes appear from the ist of October until June; they 
are always good. 

String beans can be had from the middle of February until December; 
they are in their prime during the spring and fall months. Occasionally 
we receive them in December and January from Havana, but they are not 
first-class. 

Lima beans, which are seldom shipped from the South, can be had 
from August until frost sets in; they are always good. 

Beets all the year round; best in spring'and summer. 

Cabbage all the year round; always good. The first new cabbage 
comes from Florida in March. During the winter large quantities of 
cabbages are imported from Denmark. 

Carrots all the year; the small young ones appearing in the spring. 

Chives can be had all the year round. 

Cucumbers all the year round. In the winter we get them from the 
hot-houses around Boston; they are of the very finest quality, although 
rather expensive. 

Cauliflower all the year round; we have them in January, February, 
and March from England and France, and in April and May from the hot- 
houses on Long Island. They are of fine quality at all seasons except 
during summer. 

Celery may be had in every month but May and June, but is best 
during the cold weather. It is being extensively raised in Kalamazoo, 
Mich., for the past three or four years; and as they raise it much earlier 
than we, and of good quality, it will not be long before we have it all 
the year round. 

Chervil may be had all the year round, but is usually poor during 
warm weather. 

Chicory we have from August until March; best during fall and winter 
months; occasionally during February and March; a fine quality comes 
from France. 

Corn or winter salad (called by the French doucette, and by the Germans 
fetticux) from September until warm weather sets in. It is purely, as its 
name indicates, a winter salad, as it never grows in the summer. 

Cress all the year round; best in the spring. 

Dandelion from January i to June. 

Escarolle salad from August until March. 

Egg-plant all the year round ; scarce during winter. 

Garlic all the year round ; in large quantities for the past two or three 
years during May, June, and July, from New Orleans. 



VEGETABLES. \ 7 



Herbs, such as thyme, sage, sweet basil, borage, dill, lavender, 
sweet-fennel, sweet-marjoram, rosemary, summer-savory, tansy, etc., 
may be had green in the summer and fall, and dry during the balance 
of the year. 

Kohl-rabi from May until November. 

Knot celery from September until May. 

Leeks all the year round. 

Lettuce can be had all the year round. In the winter it comes from 
the hot-houses of Boston, Providence, Long Island, and Jersey, but princi- 
pally from Providence, as that city for the past few years has made a 
business of growing lettuce for the New York market. It is best in the 
fall and spring. It is almost impossible to grow good lettuce in the 
summer, for, should it head at all, the warm weather would rot it. 

Mint can be had nearly all the year round; scarce during December 
and January. 

Mushrooms can be had all the year round; they are raised principally 
in cellars and hot-houses on Long Island, and the demand for them 
increases yearly. The people are gradually getting over the fear they 
once had of the poisonous toad-stools, of which, by the way, there is no 
danger now, as the mushrooms are carefully picked and sent to market 
by men who understand the business They are scarce during the very 
warm weather. 

Oyster-plant can be had from September until June. 

Okra appears all the year round; in the winter and spring it comes 
from Havana. 

Parsley all the year round. 

Onions may be had all the year round. 

Green peppers all the year round. In winter we get them from 
Havana. 

Potatoes all the year round. There need be but little fear of a potato- 
famine. During the past few years, when our own crop has been light, 
large quantities were imported from England, Ireland, Scotland, and 
Germany. The first new potatoes come from Bermuda about April i. 

Sweet potatoes from August until June. 

Peas from March until November. 

Parsnips from September until June. 

Pumpkins from September until February. 

Romaine salad can be had in the spring and fall. 

Radishes all the year round; they are very scarce in hot weather. 

Rhubarb from February until July. 

Brussels-sprouts from October until April. We import the very 
finest from France during March and April, but our growers are improv- 
ing in raising them from year to year, and we hope before long to rival the 
French. 

Kale-sprouts from November until June. 

Shallots all the year round. They are green in spring and summer 
and can be had dry during winter. 
2 



1 8 THE TABLE. 



Spinach all the year round; it is covered up in the early winter to 
keep it from freezing, but occasionally during extreme cold weather the 
cold reaches it, when it is impossible to cut it, which makes it scarce and 
high in the markets. 

Sorrel can be had all the year round; it is raised mostly by French 
gardeners. 

White and yellow summer-squash from April until October. 

Marrow-squash all the year round, except May and part of June; 
they are used quite generally to make pies instead of pumpkins. 

Tomatoes can be had all the year round, except December and part 
of January. The first new ones come from Key West; they are of 
excellent quality. 

White and ruta-baga turnips can be had all the year round. 

Estragon appears from March until December. 



WATER-MELONS AND MUSK-MELONS. 



WATER-MELONS first make their appearance in market about the 
first of July, and can be had until the middle of October. Un- 
like the musk-melon, they are of a rather hardy nature, and 
after the melon has grown on the vine, the changes in temperature, or rain, 
have little effect on them. The first in market come from Florida, and as 
the season advances we get them from further North, until New Jersey is 
reached. More melons are raised in Georgia than in any other State, and of 
far better quality. The best variety to be relied on, as to quality, is known 
as the " Gem." 

Musk-melons, although raised in nearly all parts of the country where 
the climate will admit, are seldom shipped to New York from any distance 
further than North Carolina, as a musk-melon, in order to be of good fla- 
vor, must be ripened, or nearly so, on the vine. When ripe they are 
so easily cracked or mashed that they would not stand transportation. 
For the past two or three years, a few, of a rather hard-rind variety, but 
of excellent flavor, have been shipped from New Orleans, but with only 
partial success, as the cost of transportation and the loss are so great that 
it hardly pays. We often hear the remark, " I have not eaten a good 
melon this season." This can be easily explained. 

A melon is of a very sensitive nature, and the delicious flavor is destroyed 
by rain or cold weather. A melon-patch from which we get finely flavored 
melons to-day, may be ruined (as to flavor) for a few days, by a heavy 
rain-storm ; for the melon absorbs water like a sponge. When we have 
hot nights and no rain, we have perfect melons. Invariably, it is during 
this kind of weather that they are most appreciated. Melons first appear 
about the middle of July, and last until cold weather. 



HOW TO SET A TABLE. 



HOW TO SET A TABLE. 



TO set a table seems, perhaps, very easy, but to set it properly and 
tastily is not such an easy matter. The advice herewith given may 
prove advantageous to many. 

Place the table in the centre of the dining-room, under the chandelier, 
and see to it that it is perfectly steady ; that is to say, that there is no

7 Glass for Water. 



danger of its being shaken while the dinner is in progress. Should it not 
rest firmly, perhaps an old relic, in the shape of a Bland Dollar, could be 
made serviceable by placing it under one of the feet. See to it that 
-there is plenty of space between each cover ; it is annoying to come in 
contact with every move of your neighbor. 

A table for six persons should be six feet long. Take a woolen cloth 
.and put it over the table, and then place a linen cloth on top of it ; this 
will deaden the noise of plates and glasses. 

Flowers should never be absent from the table when you have guests ; 
they can be procured at all seasons. A large basket or bouquet should be 
placed in the centre of the table ; a large bouquet on the right side for 
each lady, and a small boutonntire for each gentleman, also on the right 
side of the cover. 



2O THE TABLE. 



On each side of the centre-piece place a fruit-stand, nicely arranged 
with the choicest fruits of the season. Next to this place a compotier with 
assorted cakes. Place celery, olives, or radishes symmetrically in the 
space that is left between the centre and the covers. Fish-knives, soup- 
spoons, and oyster-forks must be placed on the right side of the plate, 
and the fork on the left side. If desired, place fancy pieces on the table, 
(pieces months}; but as the foregoing items pertain only to a dinner for six 
persons it would crowd out much available space. The diagram on the 
preceding page will illustrate the arrangement of the glasses on the table. 

Napkins can be arranged in various styles and figures ; into flowers or 
any other desired form. The latest and most fashionable way is to arrange 
them folded plainly, so as to show the monogram of the family. A small 
salt-cellar should be placed at each cover, to avoid asking the servant for it. 

Menus, either printed or written, should be placed at each cover. It 
is not a breach of etiquette to refuse a course you do not desire ; by know- 
ing what is coming, you can with propriety refuse a course, and take the 
next one. 

About ten minutes before commencing dinner, fill the decanters with 
Sauterne and with sherry, and place the same on the table, as in diagram, 
marked C and D. 



HOW TO SERVE MEALS. 



NEARLY every family of means is in the habit of giving a few dinners 
to its friends during the year. As a matter of course, the mem- 
bers of the family are, in return, invited to " dine out." 

If you invite your friends to a dinner, you should not wish them to 
go away dissatisfied. After a varied experience of many years, both in 
this country and in Europe, the author feels that no apologies are neces- 
sary if he endeavors to enlighten our epicures and dinner-givers as to how 
to arrange and serve a fine dinner, from commencement to close, after the 
manner of the French. 

It should not be forgotten that much depends upon the appearance of 
the table, and the manner of serving the courses. In fact, more success 
can be attained by studied attention to the room, the table, and the serv- 
ing of the courses, than in the preparation of costly viands. 

On entering a dining-room, the first object which strikes the eye is the 
table. If the table is void of flowers, and other side decorations, includ- 
ing olives, radishes, and celery, tastefully arranged napkins and wine- 
glasses, an impression is given of a boarding-house table. On the contrary, 
when you see a beautifully decorated and artistically arranged table, the 
heart is immediately gladdened. 

A proper regard should be given to the comfort of the guests as 
regards temperature. Have the room neither too cold nor too warm; the 



HOW TO SERVE MEALS. 21 

temperature should never exceed sixty degrees. The dining-room should 
be well aired before dinner commences. Great care should be taken that 
the dinner be served very hot. Noises with plates and glasses should 
be avoided. 

There is as much system in serving a fine dinner as there is in running 
a railroad, or in any other business. French dinners are generally served 
in three main courses, viz., Releves, Entries, and Rotis ; all the rest are 
considered side courses. It depends entirely on the taste of the host as 
to how many main courses he desires served. The author would suggest 
two relevJs, three entries, and one or two rotis; this could be made an 
elaborate dinner. 

Naturally, what you shall serve will depend entirely on what there is 
in market at the season. For instance, you cannot serve brook-trout 
in January, or canvas-back duck during the months of June, July, August, 
or September. However, the very best in the market should invariably 
be selected. 

Care should be taken to have the wines at the right temperature. 
Sherry, Sauterne, Chablis, and Rhine wines should always be served cold. 
Champagne should be served very cold, almost at the freezing-point. 
Bordeaux and Burgundy should be kept twelve hours before dinner in a 
room at a temperature of seventy degrees. Servants. should be instructed 
not to fill the glasses more than three-fourths full; for guests are in dan- 
ger of soiling their dresses, and, again, it is not considered good form. 

The following is a fair menu for a New Year's dinner, with the 
necessary instructions how to serve it:

22 THE TABLE. 



To begin with the oysters or clams: place some finely chopped ice on 
each soup-plate, with a small fancy napkin on top. Arrange the oysters 
or clams nicely on top of each plate, with a piece of lemon, and serve. 
With this course serve also Haut Sauterne. It is understood that the 
oysters or clams are to be served after all the guests are seated. It should 
be made a rule never to remove any plates while some of the guests are 
still eating. When all have finished, remove the oyster-plates and leave 
dinner-plates in their stead; then serve the soup. The servant is expected 
to present a plate of each kind to each guest, and ask which is preferred. 
Serve sherry with the soup. Always serve the plates on the right side, 
and remove on the left. Serve timbales. First put a spoonful of sauce 
on each plate, and then the timbale; at the same time you are serving the 
timbale, remove the cold plates and serve the fish. Put the fish on the 
plates, then the sauce, with a few potatoes on the same plate. Serve 
Rauenthaler-Berg. Remove the plates and serve fillet of beef, which 
should be cut in small, even slices. Put the sauce on the plate, and then 
the fillet. Place the artichokes on the same plate. Serve Pommery Sec 
with this and with the other course. Remove the plates and serve saddle 
of mutton. Cut the loin of the saddle lengthwise, and then crosswise, 
and serve with a little gravy and a spoonful of string-beans on the same 
plate. When this course is finished, serve the sweetbreads. Put the 
sauce first on the plate, as with the fillet, with a spoonful of peas. With 
this serve Chateau Latour. The next course, terrapin, should be served 
in a very hot tureen. Before serving, add a little fine sherry; mix well, 
and give each guest a small portion. Serve more Chateau Latour with 
this course. 

After this comes sorbet. This can be served in glasses or in shells; 
for instance, take six lemons or six small oranges, cut off the tops, take 
the soft parts out of them, and in them place the sorbet. Arrange them 
on cold dessert-plates, decorated with small fancy napkins or fancy paper. 
While the guests are enjoying the sorbet, remove sherry, Sauterne, and 
Hock glasses, no matter if empty or full. (Replace knives and forks 
before serving the sorbet.) 

Now come canvas-back ducks. Before serving, place them for a 
moment before the host, so that all the guests can see them. Cut off only 
the breasts, and serve with a little of the gravy and a small piece of fried 
hominy, on very hot plates; then pass around the currant jelly. You can 
serve a whole breast or a half one; however, during a hearty dinner, a 
half one is preferable; this is entirely at the disposition of the host. Serve 
celery salad with mayonnaise dressing on separate dessert-plates, with 
forks, and then serve Chambertin. 

When this course is finished, remove all side dishes, casters, and salt 
and pepper cruets, and leave nothing on the table but flowers, fruits, and 
cakes. Clean the table neatly with a brush or napkin, and then place 
dessert spoons and forks at each cover. Serve plum pudding the same as 
omelette au rum. Pour the rum over the pudding, spread powdered 
sugar on top, and, with a spoon, keep pouring the burning liquid over it 



HOW TO SERVE MEALS. 23 

until it ceases to burn. Then cut in slices and serve, putting some of the 
liquid on each plate. 

Vanilla and pistache ice-cream should be served on cold dessert-plates 
with fancy paper underneath, and with dessert spoons and forks. Serve 
the cakes with the ice-cream. 

When this course is finished, serve to each guest a finger-bowl, with a 
thin slice of lemon in the water. Small cups for coffee should be passed 
at the same time. Fruits, nuts, and raisins come next. It is customary 
with some old American families to introduce at this course a bottle of 
very old Madeira wine; but this is certainly not necessary. 

Now comes the last, the coffee, which must be served fresh and very 
hot, for the preparation of which the author refers you to page 381. At 
the same time serve cordials, and the dinner will be completed. 



MENUS FOR EVERY DAY IN THE YEAR. 



EXPLANATORY NOTE. 

While these menus are Dimple and complete, it is not supposed that they can always be 
carried out in detail. They will, however, furnish suggestions to house-keepers who are daily 
perplexed with the question, "What shall we have for breakfast, luncheon, and dinner?" The 
number placed after each dish refers to the recipe showing how the dish is prepared. The 
menus are arranged so as to be used foi any year. New Year's, 1890, will begin on a Wednes- 
day instead of a Tuesday, as here printed; in that' case, use the New Year's menu and then turn 
to the first Thursday in January and proceed in regular order. Should you come out uneven 
at the end of the month, through skipping some days at the first, turn back again to the begin- 
ning. For instance should Thursday be the 2yth of January, instead of the last, as punted, turn 
back to the first Friday in January, and proceed until the month is completed. Special menus 
have been prepared for New Year's Day, Washington's Birthday. Fourth of July, Thanksgiving 
Day, and Christmas.

SOUPS 



1. Bonille-a-Baisse. Chop two medium-sized, peeled, sound onions 
very fine, with one medium-sized, fine, fresh, green pepper, the same 
way, and put them in a pan on the hot range, with a gill of sweet oil. 
When well browned, moisten with three pints of hot white broth (No. 99). 
Cut three skinned, good-sized, sound, well-washed potatoes into quarters, 
also three fine, good-sized, sound, red, peeled tomatoes into rather small 
pieces ; put all in the soup. Season with a pinch of salt (the equivalent 
of a tablespoonful) and half a pinch of pepper, and then boil well for fully 
one hour and a half, placing into it a strong bouquet (No. 254) at the be- 
ginning, also half a teaspoonful of powdered saffron, diluted in a little 
water; when nearly done, add one pound of boned codfish, cut into small 
pieces ; boil again for three minutes, pour into a hot soup tureen, and 
serve with six slices of toasted bread. 

2. Brimoise. Pare and cut into small squares three medium-sized 
carrots, one turnip, half an onion, and two leeks ; put these with two 
ounces of butter in a covered saucepan for a few moments ; moisten with 
three pints of broth (No. 99), season with half a tablespoonful of salt, and 
a teaspoonful of pepper. Cook for three-quarters of an hour, and then 
add a handful of chiffonade (No. 132) ; when ready, ser.ve with six slices 
of toasted bread. 

3. Br II noise with Bice. The same as for No. 2, adding half a cupful 
of uncooked rice about seventeen minutes before serving ; taste to see if 
sufficiently seasoned, and serve. 

4. Brimoise With Sorrel. The same, adding two good handfuls of 
chopped sorrel about two minutes before serving. 

5. Beef a 1' Anglaise. Cut up into small squares a quarter of a pound 
of raw, lean beef ; brown them a little in a saucepan on the hot range, 
then moisten with three pints of broth (No. 99), add half a pint of prin- 
tanier (No. 51), a handful of barley, and half a pinch each of salt and pep- 
per. Boil thoroughly for half an hour, and a few moments before 
serving put in one medium-sized sliced tomato, taste to see if sufficiently 
seasoned, then pour the soup into a hot tureen, and send to the table. 

6. Beef a PEcossaise, thickened. Brown in a little fat, in a sauce- 
pan, a quarter of a pound of small squares of lean beef and a sliced onion ;

spoonful of pepper. Let cook for thirty minutes, then serve. 



THE TABLE. 



7. Busecca. Brown in a saucepan one pint of raw printanier (No. 51), 
adding half a pint of chopped celery ; let steam gently for about ten 
minutes, then moisten with three pints of white broth (No. 99) and a 
quarter of a pound of very finely shred tripe ; season with half a table- 
spoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper. Cook thoroughly for 
twenty-five minutes, and serve with a little grated cheese, separate. 

8. Bisque of Clams. Open twelve large clams, scald them whole in 
their own juice, and drain. Then pound them in a mortar, and put 
them back into a saucepan with the same water. Add one quart of 
white broth (No. 99), one bouquet (No. 254), half a pint of raw rice, a 
little pepper, but no salt ; boil for forty-five minutes, then strain through 
a fine sieve, adding half a cupful of good cream. Let it heat, but not 
boil again, and serve with very small squares of fried bread. 

9. Bisque of Crabs. Boil four hard-shelled crabs in salted water for 
about fifteen minutes; wash and drain them well, and proceed as for No. 8. 

10. Bisque of Lobster. The same as for No. 8. Two pounds of 
lobster boiled in the shell will be sufficient; serve with small squares of 
boiled lobster claw, cut in dice. 

11. Croute-au-Pot. Take two carrots cut in round slices, one 
turnip, cut .the same, adding a few pieces of celery and half a quarter of 
chopped-up cabbage ; stew them for ten minutes in a covered saucepan, 
with two ounces of butter ; then moisten with three pints of white broth 
(No. 99), adding half a tablespoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper. 
Boil well for thirty minutes, and serve with six pieces of dry toasted 
rolls. 

12. Fish Chowder, Boston style. Take a nice live codfish of about 
six pounds, cut the head off and remove all the bones, then cut the fish 
into square pieces, place them in a bowl, and add half a pinch of salt and a 
pint of cold water so as to have the flesh firm. Take the head and 
bones, place them in a saucepan with two quarts of white broth (No. 99) 
on the stove, and as soon as it comes to a boil, skim it well. Season 
with one pinch of salt and half a pinch of pepper. Let boil for twenty 
minutes. Peel and slice very fine one small, sound onion, place it in a 
saucepan with one ounce of butter, half an ounce of salt pork, cut in small 
dice-shaped pieces, let cook for five minutes, then add two tablespoonfuls 
of flour. Stir well together for three minutes on a brisk fire, being care- 
ful not to let it get brown. Strain the broth into a bowl, and when all 
strained in, add it to the flour," stirring well until all the broth is added. 
Let boil for ten minutes. Cut two good-sized, sound potatoes in small 
dice-shaped pieces, add them to the soup. Boil five minutes. Drain the 
codfish, wash it once more, and add it to the soup. Boil five minutes 
more ; add half a pint of cold milk, being very careful not to allow to boil 
again; sprinkle a teaspoonful of chopped parsley over, and serve very hot. 

13. Clam Chowder. Wash six fine, medium-sized potatoes, peel and 
cut them into small dice-shaped pieces, wash again in fresh water, take them 
Up with a skimmer ; place them in a stewpan large enough to hold three 
quarts. Immediately add two quarts of cold water (not placing the pan on 



SOUPS. 153 



the fire until so mentioned). Peel one medium-sized, sound onion, chop it 
up very fine, and place it on a plate. Take a quarter of a bunch of well- 
washed parsley greens (suppressing the stalks), place it with the onions ; 
wash well two branches of soup celery, chop it up very fine, place it with 
the parsley and onions, and add all these in the stewpan. Place the pan on 
a brisk fire. Season with a light pinch of salt, adding at the same time a 
light tablespoonful of good butter. Let all cook until the pototoes are 
nearly done; eighteen minutes will be sufficient. Cut out from a piece 
of fresh pork, crosswise, one slice a third of an inch thicic, then cut it in 
pieces a third of an inch square, fry, and reduce it in a pan on the hot stove 
for four minutes. Add it to the broth, add also three-quarters of a 
teaspoonful of branch dry thyme. Lightly scald four fine, medium-sized 
tomatoes, peel and cut them into small pieces and add them to the prep- 
aration. Open and place in a bowl twenty-four medium-sized, fine, 
fresh clams ; pour into another bowl half of their juice. Place the clams 
on a wooden board, cut each one into four equal pieces, and immediately 
plunge them into the pan with the rest; gently mix, so as to prevent 
burning at the bottom while boiling, for two minutes. Range the pan on 
the corner of the stove to keep warm. Season with a saltspoonful of 
black pepper, one tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce, gently stir the 
whole with a wooden spoon ; break in two pilot crackers in small pieces, 
stir a little again. Leave two minutes longer in the same position, but 
under no circumstances allow to boil. Pour it into a hot soup-tureen, and 
serve. 

14. Chiffonade. Wash we!2, drain, and chop up very fine one quart 
of sorrel with the green leaves of a lettuce-head. Brown in a saucepan, 
with two ounces of butter and a sliced onion, seasoning with half a table- 
spoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper. Moisten with three pints of 
white broth (No. 99), add a handful of peas, the same of string beans and 
asparagus tops; boil for three-quarters of an hour with an ounce of but- 
ter; serve with six slices of toasted bread. 

15. How to Prepare Green Turtle. Select a medium-sized turtle, 
cut off the head, and let it bleed for twelve hours. Remove the bones by 
opening the sides ; cut the carcass in pieces, and blanch them for three 
minutes in boiling water. Lift off the top shell and place it in a sauce- 
pan, covering it with white broth (No. 99), a handful of whole pepper, 
one dozen cloves, half a bunch of thyme, and six bay leaves (all the 
above spices and herbs carefully tied in a white cloth). Add a handful of 
salt, and cook for about one hour. Drain, remove the bones, cut the 
rest in dice-sized squares. Let the broth be reduced to three-fourths its 
quantity, then put in the white, lean meat, letting it cook for ten minutes, 
and then add the green part (the shell) of the turtle. Fill some medium- 
sized pots with this, and when cooled off pour hot lard over the tops. A 
good glassful of Madeira wine can be added to the broth, according to 
taste.

about six hours. 

141. Meat Glaze Glace de Viande. As this meat glaze, when prop- 
erly made, will keep in perfect condition for any length of time, I would 
advise that half a pint be made at a time, in the following manner. Place

one ounce of good butter; then place it in a saucepan on a moderate fire, 
stirring, until it clarifies, for about five minutes; then strain through a 
napkin, letting it drop into cold water. When it is congealed, take it out, 
and place it in a warm basin, stirring until it assumes the desired color. 
The same method can be used for lobsters and shrimps. 

151. Sauce Espagnole for one gallon. Mix one pint of raw, strong

placed in cold, fresh water for two hours, then drained, and with the 
hand split in two along the backbone. Lay them in a small bowl and 
cover with sweet oil, and use as desired. 

286. Saucisson de Lyon. Procure a medium-sized, fine saucisson 
de Lyon, 'cut twelve very thin slices from it, dress nicely upon a radish- 
dish, and place a few parsley-leaves in the centre. 

287. Mortadella, To be served the same as the above (No. 286). 

288. Tomatoes, side dish. Take six fine, firm, red tomatoes, wipe 
well, then plunge them into boiling water for one minute, drain and 
peel them. Put them in a cool place, and when thoroughly cold, cut 
them into slices, arrange them on a radish-dish, sprinkle a little salt, 
pepper, and vinegar over. 

289. Cucumbers, side dish. Take two medium-sized, fine cicum- 
bers, peel neatly, and cut them in thin slices. Place in a bowl with a 
good pinch of salt, and put them in a cold place for two hours. Then 
drain the liquid off, and season with half a pinch of pepper, a tablespoon- 
ful of vinegar, and the same quantity of oil. Dress nicely in a radish- 
dish. 

290. Celery, in glass. Procure a bunch of fine, white Kalamazoo 
celery, pare off the green stalks, and trim the roots neatly. Be careful to 
save the clear, white hearts. Cut each plant lengthwise into four equal 
branches. Wash them well in cold water, and put them into clean water 
with a piece of ice until ready to serve ; then arrange them nicely in a 
celery glass, or dress on a china radish-dish, with a few pieces of ice in 
the centre. 

291. Celery, frizzled. Another and economical way to prepare celery 
for a side dish to decorate the table. Take only one large head of fine 
celery. Pare off the green stalks, and cut off the root (reserving it for 
a delicious and wholesome salad). Cut the stalk lengthwise into four 
equal branches. Wash them well in cold water, then cut each one 
into pieces about as long as one's finger ; by so doing, all the branches 
will be separated. With the aid of a small, keen knife pare the thin 
sides a little, making five or six slits in each piece, starting from the top, 
downwards, leaving half to three-quarters of an inch uncut; place 
them in cold water with plenty of ice, leaving them in for two hours. 
Lift it from the ice-water, artistically dress on a round glass dish, and 
send to the table. Celery arranged and served in this way makes a beauti- 
ful effect on the table, but requires a little patience in its preparation. 

292. Radishes, how to prepare. If the radishes be 'quite large, take 
three bunches if small, four bunches being careful to select them 
round, firm, and the reddest procurable. Pare off all the leaves and 
stems except the two prettiest on each radish. Cut away the roots, and 
also a little of the peel around the roots. With a small, sharp knife 
divide the remaining peel into five or six equal-sized leaves, beginning 
at the root end, and cutting toward the green stems, but being careful to 



192 



THE TABLE. 



avoid detaching the leaves. They can be formed into any desired design 
by cutting them with care. Place them in cold water until required. 
When serving, arrange the radishes artistically on a flat saucer, the 
radishes meeting toward the centre, the green leaves lying outward. 
Serve with chopped ice over them. 

293. Remarks Regarding- Radishes. The following incident hap- 
pened in my presence over twenty-five years ago. One evening, dinner was 
served to a party of prominent gentlemen in Lyons, France, among whom 
were Alexander Dumas, pere, the great novelist, and JBerger, the famous 
billiard player. While the waiter was in the act of handing the radishes 
to M. Dumas, he saw a change come over him ; anger was depicted in 
his face, and he thoroughly expected to see the radishes, radish-dish, etc., 
flung full at him. He stood amazed, not daring to question the dis- 
tinguished guest. When his anger subsided, he amiably explained 
that the cause of his sudden ill-temper was offering to him radishes 
peeled, and deprived of their green stalks; he asserted that the healthiest 
and best parts had been removed. After inquiries of more experienced 
co-laborers, the waiter thoroughly agreed with M. Dumas, and experi- 
ence has taught him the correctness of his judgment. 

Radishes are a luxurious and healthful adjunct to the dinner-table, and 
can be procured almost the whole year ; but in the spring the markets 
are more plentifully supplied, and that is the most wholesome season to 
partake of them. 

294. Welsh Rarebit. Take one pound of American cheese ; cut up 
in small pieces. Place them in a sautoire, adding half a glassful of good ale. 
Season with half a saltspoonful of red pepper. Stir it continually with 
a wooden spoon until the mass is well melted, which will take about ten 
minutes. Have six nice, fresh, large pieces of toast ; arrange them on a 
very hot dish, and distribute the preparation equally over, serving the 
rarebit very hot. 

295. Golden Buck. Proceed as for the above (No. 294), and when 
ready to serve, dress a poached egg (No. 404) on each piece of toast, and 
serve very hot. 

296. (Gherkin Buck. Prepared the same as Golden Buck (No. 295), 
only adding to each toast a slice of broiled bacon (No. 754), and sending 
to the table very hot. 

297. Welsh Rarebit an Gratin. Prepare six toasts of American 
bread ; broil them lightly, remove, and cover each with a slice of Swiss 
cheese a little less than half an inch thick ; lay them in a roasting-pan, 
sprinkling a very little pepper over. Put in the oven for ten minutes. 
Arrange the toasts on a very hot dish, and send to the table. 

A pinch of salt represents 205 grains, or a tablespoonful. 
Half a pinch of pepper represents 38 grains, or a teaspoonful. 
A third of a pinch of nutmeg represents 13 grains, or half a tea- 
spoonful,

298. How to Serve Oysters for Private Families. Oysters should 
be kept in a very cold place before they are opened, and well washed 
before using, otherwise their appearance will be destroyed. They should, 
according to the French custom, be opened on the deep shell, so as to 
better preserve the liquor, then laid on finely chopped ice for a short time 
too long destroys their flavor. While they should be kept as cold as 
possible, they should never be allowed to freeze, therefore they must only 
be opened shortly before they are needed ; for once frozen, they quickly 
turn sour. The proper way to open them is to place the deep shell in 
the palm of the left hand, and break them on one side. The Boston stab- 
bing-knife is preferable for this, but if there.be none handy use a small 
block that the oyster can fit into, and stab it on the edge ; or even a chop- 
ping-block and chopping-knife may be employed in case of necessity. 
Serve six oysters for each person, nicely arranged on oyster-plates with 
quarters of lemon. 

299. Oysters a 1'Alexandre Dumas. Place in a sauce-bowl a heaped 
teaspoonful of salt, three-quarters of a teaspoonful of very finely crushed 
white pepper, one medium-sized, fine, sound, well-peeled, and very finely 
chopped shallot, one heaped teaspoonful of very finely chopped chives, 
and half a teaspoonful of parsley, also very finely chopped up. Mix lightly 
together, then pour in a light teaspoonful of olive oil, six drops of Tabasco 
sauce, one saltspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, and lastly one light gill, 
or five and a half tablespoonfuls, of good vinegar. Mix it thoroughly with 
a spoon ; send to the table, and with a teaspoon pour a little of the sauce 
over each oyster just before eating them. 

300. How to serve Clams. Clams should be served on deep plates, 
covered previously with finely chopped ice. To have them sweet and 
fresh, they should be kept as cold as possible. Serve six on each plate 
with quarters of lemon. 

301. To prepare Breaded Fish. i. After the fish is pared, cleaned, 
and dried, dip it first in milk, then in flour, and fry in very hot fat. 

2. Take very clean fish, dip it in beaten egg, then in freshly grated 
bread-crumbs, and fry in very hot fat. 

3. For certain fish, like whitebait, immerse them in milk, then in flour 
mixed with pulverized crackers, shake well in a colander, and throw into 
very hot fat. Oysters are breaded the same way, but should be flattened 
before frying. 

4. For croustades of rice or potatoes, dip in beaten egg and roll in 
fresh bread-crumbs ; repeat three times before frying. 

302. Salmon, en Papillotes. Procure two pounds of very fresh sal-

the kettle on a brisk fire. Five minutes after coming to a boil the salmon 
will be sufficiently cooked. Remove from the kettle, drain it well ; dress 
on a hot dish with a folded napkin, nicely decorate with parsley-greens all 
around the salmon, and serve with a pint of hot oyster sauce (No. 173) 
separately. 

The necessary time to cook the above to perfection, from beginning to 
end, will be thirty-five minutes.

strain the broth into a sautoire, reduce it to one-half, and add to the gar- 
nish with a regence garnishing (No. 235) ; glaze the top of the fish with

Broiled Spanish-mackerel are prepared in the same way. 

330. Mackerel en Papillotes. Oil three sheets of white paper a little 
larger than the length of the fish. Cut six thin slices of cooked, lean ham; 
lay one slice on each piece of paper, and on top a tablespoonful of cooked

on each side; season with a good pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper, 
divided evenly on both sides of the fish, then roll them lightly, and lay 
the mackerel on top of the fine herbs; spread a tablespoonful more herbs 
over each mackerel, and cover with a slice of ham. Then lift up the other 
side of the paper and twist the edges together with the fingers, or a 
simpler way is to fold them the same as trout (No. 316). When ready, 
put them in a baking-sheet, place them in a moderate oven, and let bake

heavy pinch of salt and three drops of vinegar. Have easily at hand 
twelve fresh eggs. When, and only when, the water boils, rapidly but 
carefully crack six of them, one by one. As success to have them in 
proper shape and cooked to perfection depends upon how they are handled, 
special care should be taken to crack them as rapidly as possible, care- 
fully avoiding to break the yolks, and dropping each one right on the 
spot where the water bubbles, and as near the boiling-point as possible. 
Poach for one minute and a quarter from the time that the water boils 
after the eggs were put in. Lift them up with a skimmer, lay them on 
the freshly prepared toasts, or use for any other desired purpose; and

silver dish. Repeat the same operation .with ten more, two at a time ; 
when all on the dish, sprinkle over them an ounce of grated Parmesan 
cheese. Place in the hot oven to brown for one minute. Reduce the 
gravy in which they were poached to one-half, then carefully pour the

753. How to Prepare Ham for Broiling and Frying-. Procure a fine, 
sound, smoked ham, weighing about twelve to thirteen pounds, select- 
ing it as lean as possible. With a sharp knife, begin cutting it care- 
fully at the end of the shank bone, between the bone and the string used 
for hanging purposes, coming down on to the knuckle ; follow the edge 
of the bone, until the small edge-bone is fully reached, then make a 
straight cross-cut from the bone, so as to separate it entirely. When this 
is accomplished, put the bone part aside for soup, garnishing, scrambled 
eggs, sauces, or any other needful purposes. Keep the ham hung up in 
a dry place in a moderate temperature. 

For broiling and frying. Cut from the boneless part the necessary 
number of slices desired to be used each time, as thin as possible, always 
beginning from the side of the edge-bone. Pare off the skin neatly from 
the slices, and arrange them on the broiler, then broil them for two min- 
utes on each side; take from off the fire, dress them on a hot dish, and 
send to the table.

crisp and enjoyable. When frying, four minutes will be sufficient in very 
hot fat.

English breakfast bacon, and with a keen knife cut the under bones off; 
pare both edges neatly, also the end (the opposite side to the string which 
hangs it up). With the use of the same sharp knife, cut the necessary 
number of slices desired for immediate use, and no more. Thin slices are 



262 THE TABLE. 



always preferable, so that the bacon, whether broiled or fried, will be 
crispy and tasty. When cutting off the slices be careful to avoid detach- 
ing them from the skin, also cut them crosswise, but never lengthwise. 
Arrange the slices on the broiler, and broil on a moderate fire for two 
minutes on each side ; dress the crispy slices on a hot dish, and serve 
immediately. 

Four minutes will suffice for frying. See that the bacon is kept hang- 
ing by the string in a dry, cool place, but never put it on the ice. 

A pinch of salt represents 205 grains, or a tablespoonful. 

Half a pinch of pepper represents 38 grains, or a teaspoonful.

very careful not to make any holes in the skin, as it should remain per- 
fectly intact. Make an incision from the first joint, then bone both legs. 
Cut away also, very carefully, the two wing bones. Season the inside 
with one pinch of salt and half a pinch of pepper, evenly divided. Place 
it on a dish, and lay it in the ice-box until needed. Take two pounds 
of lean, raw veal, three pounds of fresh pork, and half a pound of 
larding pork, all cut up into small dice-shaped pieces. Season with two 
pinches of salt, one pinch of white pepper, the third of a saltspoonful of 
grated nutmeg, and the same quantity of thyme. Mix all well together. 
Place all in the chopping machine, and chop it exceedingly fine, repeating 
the process, if necessary, until it is chopped to perfection. Should there be 
any sinews among the ingredients, remove them all. Place on a cold dish, 
and put away in the ice-box to cool until the following is prepared. Have 
ready a quarter of a pound of the end (red) part of a cooked smoked beef- 
tongue, eighteen medium-sized, sound truffles, both tongue and truffles cut

box, and thoroughly mix the tongue and truffles with it, pouring in also a 
wine-glassful of Madeira wine. Half a cup of well-peeled pistache can be 
added, if at hand. Take the turkey from the ice-box, spread it on a clean 
table (skin-side downward). Then, with a keen knife, cut away even 
slices from the breasts, arrange them on the thin, so that the turkey 
should have an equal thickness all over. Place the forcemeat right in the 
centre of the turkey, column shaped, leaving a clear space of two inches 
at each end, and of four inches at each side. Spread on a table a strong, 
clean napkin, sprinkling over it a little cold water. Fold up first both 
ends of the turkey, then both sides, so that the four ends should be envel- 
oped ; gently lift, and lay it right in the centre of the napkin. Roll it 
carefully in the napkin. Tightly tie one end first, then the other, as firmly 
as possible, taking in the slack of the napkin. Place it in a large sauce- 
pan on the hot range, with the carcass, and whatever bones and debris 
pertain to it, completely cover with cold water, place the lid on, and 
when coming to a boil thoroughly skim it, then add one medium-sized, 
sound, scraped carrot, and one well-peeled onion with three cloves stuck 
in. Season with one pinch of salt, and then let boil on a moderate fire for 
fully two and a half hours. Remove the galantine with a skimmer ; let 
cool enough so that it can be easily handled. Cut the strings at both ends ; 
roll it over again as before, and tightly tie both ends exactly as before. 
Lay it in a flat tin pan, placing on top of it a board the size of the boned 
turkey, and on top of it a weight of seven pounds, leaving the weight on 
until the galantine is thoroughly cold, which will take a whole night ; but 
avoid placing it in the ice-box until thoroughly cold. Two days after the 
preparation it will be ready for use ; keeping it in the ice-box in the 
same napkin in which it was cooked. 

814. Jelly for Boned Turkey. Strain the broth in which the galantine 
was cooked into another saucepan, thoroughly skim all the fat off, add

POULTRY. 273 



juice of half a sound lemon, adding half a glassful of Madeira wine, and a 
small piece of ice, the size of an egg, finely cracked. Beat all sharply 
together with a wire whip. Place the broth on the table at hand near the 
eggs, &c. , and with a soup-ladle in the left hand, a wire whip in the 
right, add a ladleful of broth, little by little, to the eggs, carefully and 
sharply stirring with the whip until all the broth has been added. Place

strain through a flannel bag or a napkin into a clean bowl and let cool, and 
it will be ready for use.

and if it detaches easily, the artichokes are sufficiently done. Take them 
from the water, and put them to drain upside down. Arrange them on a 
dish with a folded napkin, and serve. Artichokes prepared in this way 
can be eaten with white, blonde, Hollandaise, or any kind of sauce. To

1037. Anchovy Salad. Have eighteen bottled anchovies (or the same 
quantity of Norwegian anchovies if possible), soak them in cold water for 
two hours, so they are thoroughly unsalted, then drain them in a cloth,

DKSSKRTS: 

PASTRY, JELLIES, ICES, PRESERVES, ETC. 



1076. Feuilletage, or Puff Paste. Have ready one pound of flour, one 
pound of fresh butter, one pint of ice-water, and a saltspoonful of salt. 
If the butter be salted instead of fresh, no salt is necessary, but wash the 
butter well before using it. Put the flour on the table, make a hollow 
space in the centre, then put in it one ounce of the butter, adding the pint 
of ice-water and the salt, and mix the whole well together, incorporating 
it gradually. Put it aside in a cool place for five minutes. Have ready 
the remaining fifteen ounces of butter, which must be very firm ; sprinkle 
the space of a square foot of the table with a very little flour, place the 
dough on it, then lengthen and widen with a wooden roller to the thick- 
ness of half an inch, and lay the fifteen ounces of butter in one lump in 
the centre. Fold over the four edges so as to enclose it, then flatten 
again lightly with the roller until it forms a piece two inches thick, and 
then put it away to cool for ten minutes. Roll it again lengthwise, fold 
it in four, and let it rest for another five minutes ; then repeat the same 
twice more, rolling it each time in a contrary direction. After five min- 
utes it will be ready for use. This feuilletage, or puff paste, if put away 
carefully in a cool place, will keep for three days, and can be used for the 
following purposes : vol-au-vents of chickens, oysters, clams, shrimps, 
lobsters, codfish, crabs, and crawfish; also for making chicken patties, 
bouchees a la reine, all kinds of tarts, allumettes, mille-feuilles, chaus- 
sons, turnovers, petits pates a la religieuse, etc., etc. 

1077. Paste for Pies. Sift on a table one pound of flour ; make a 
hollow space in the centre, pour into it a pint of cold water, two ounces 
of butter, and half a saltspoonful of salt; then, with the hand, knead the 
ingredients well together for two minutes, and gradually and slowly incor- 
porate the flour with the rest for four minutes. Lay the paste on a dish, and 
put it to rest in a cool place for three minutes. Have ready six ounces of 
well-washed butter in one lump, as for feuilletage (No. 1076); return the 
paste to the table, flatten it slightly, then put the lump of butter in the 
centre, fold over the edges, so as to enclose the butter, then roll it out 
lengthwise with the pastry roller, and -refold the paste into three folds. 
Let it rest again in a cool place for three minutes, then roll it again, fold 
it as before, and set it in the ice-box for five minutes ; the paste will now 
be ready to use, and by keeping it in the ice-box it will remain in good 
condition for three days. 

1078. Pate-a-Foucer, Foundation Paste. Sift one pound of flour on 



318 THE TABLE. 



the table, make a hollow in the centre, and pour into it half a pound of 
well-washed butter, a saltspoonful of salt, and a gill of cold water. Knead 
well the salt, butter, and water, using the hand, for two minutes, then 
incorporate the flour gradually, which will take three minutes more, and 
knead sharply with the hands. Detach it from the table, and roll it into 
a ball, then press it again on the table in different directions for two 
minutes ; remove again from the table. Flour the table slightly, lay the 
paste over, and with the fingers of the right hand press down the paste in 
the centre, and with the left bring up the edges all around to the centre, 
repeat this three times, and when finished the paste must have its original 
shape ; lay it on a dish, cover with a towel, and set it in a cool place to 
rest for twenty minutes. 

1079. How to Make a Pastry-bag, for General Use. Cut a piece of 
white duck-cloth as follows: twenty-four inches wide at the top, twenty 
inches deep, and three inches at the lower end. Fold, and sew up length- 
wise, so as to make a perfect cornet-bag. Hem the top and the bottom, 
and the pastry bag will then be ready for use. 

The accompanying design will show how it should be made. 




PASTRY-BAG. 



This pastry-bag is essential and useful for kitchen and pastry use, being 
both facile and economical, but care must be taken to wash it thoroughly, 
and immediately after using it, and to let it dry perfectly, otherwise it 
will soon become useless. 

1080. How to Clean and Prepare Sultana Currants and Raisins for 
Pastry. To avoid the trouble of preparing them each time they are 
needed, it were better to clean many at a time, for they will keep in 
perfect condition for five or six months, if put away in a well-closed tin 
box. Procure ten pounds of currants or Sultana raisins, lay them on a 
table, and should they be damp, dredge a little flour over to prevent them 
adhering to the hands. Rub them thoroughly, then take a wire sieve, 
No. 3 (or as fine a one as will prevent them passing through), place the 



DESSER TS. 



319 



currants on it, and shake them well for two or three minutes, so that they 
be perfectly free from flour and stalks. Lay the sieve containing the 
currants in a large dish-pan, filling it to the level of the sieve with hot 
water, then, with a skimmer, stir them, so that they get washed thoroughly 
for at least five minutes. Lift up the sieve, and let them drain in the 
same for three minutes. Cover an iron oven-pan with a- sheet of brown 
paper, pour the currants on it, spreading them out evenly, and set it in a 
very slow oven for ten minutes; remove, and lay them aside in the warm- 
est spot on the kitchen shelf, and leave them to dry thoroughly for at least 
two days. If in the country, the pan can be left out in the sun during the 
day. When dry, lay them on the table, and should any more foreign 
matter be found. among them, pick it out carefully with the fingers, and 
examine them well to see whether they be free of stones, stalks, stems, 
sand, &c. When finished, put them away in a closed tin box, and they 
will then be ready for use. 

1081. How to Clean Malaga Raisins. Have as many Malaga raisins 
as deemed necessary, but it were better to purchase five pounds at a 
time. Lay the raisins on a table, have a bowl of cold water on the right 
hand, and the raisins in front; pick off the dry stalks adhering to them, 
then, either using a small knife or the fingers, pick out the seeds, taking 
care to wet the fingers in the bowl of water, so as to prevent them stick- 
ing while seeding them. Close up again, giving them their original form; 
when finished, put them in a tin can, cover well, and place in a moderate 
temperature for use when required. Raisins prepared in this way will 
surely keep six months. 

1082. Mince Pie. Put into a vessel two ounces of currants, prepared 
as for No. 1080, two ounces of Sultana, and three ounces of Malaga raisins,

one ounce of powdered sugar, a saltspoonful of salt, one drachm 
of ground allspice, half a drachm of ground cloves, half a drachm 
of ground cinnamon, and mix together for one minute. Peel, core, 
and chop up very fine three large, sound apples, add them to the prepa- 
ration, then pour in half a gill each of brandy and sherry wine, mixing 
again for three minutes. Take half a pound of pie-paste as for No. 1077, 
cut out a piece of three ounces, roll it round-shaped, ten inches in diameter, 
and lightly butter a pie-plate nine and a half inches in diameter, Arrange 
the paste over, and pour the preparation in the centre, flattening it evenly, 
and leaving an inch space clear around the edge of the plate ; take the 
remaining five ounces of paste, roll it out round-shaped, the same as 
before, fold it in two, and, with a knife, make incisions in the centre, of half 
an inch each. Moisten lightly the edge of the plate with a little beaten 
egg, then cover with the paste, pressing down with the hand all around 
the edge, so as to inclose the preparation entirely, then moisten the surface 
slightly with the beaten egg. Place in a moderate oven, and let bake for 
fifty minutes; remove it to the oven-door, sprinkle plenty of powdered

ounce of corn-starch; grate in the peel of a medium-sized lemon, squeezing 
in the juice of two others, and mix the whole well together with a spatula 
for three minutes. Pour the preparation over a lined plate, as for mince 
pie (No. 1082), cover, and finish exactly the same. 

1087. Pineapple Pie. Procure a medium-sized, fine, sound, pineapple; 
pare, peel, and slice it into fine slices, laying them in a vessel, and mixing 
in three ounces of powdered sugar. Have a pie-plate lined with paste, as 
for mince pie (No. 1082), spread over one tablespoonful of apple sauce 
(No. 1328); arrange the pineapple nicely on top, then take three ounces of 
pie-paste, roll it out lengthwise, two feet long, and fold it carefully in 
two, so as to make a long narrow strip; roll it slightly again until about 
thirty inches long by one wide, paring off both sides evenly, so as to have 
it exactly the one inch in width. Moisten the edge of the pie-plate with 
beaten egg, and arrange the strip around, fastening the two ends together, 
one over the other; glaze the surface of the strip with beaten egg, then 
place the pie in a moderate oven, and let bake for fifty minutes. Remove 
to the door, dredge the pie well with powdered sugar, return to the oven

and half a saltspoonful of salt. Cover, and let cook for ten minutes. Remove 
the lid, and add to the apples two tablespoonfuls of apricot marmalade 
(No. 1335). Stir slightly at the bottom for four minutes with the spatula, 
being careful to avoid breaking the apples. Cover the bottom and sides 
of the timbale with half a pound of the boiled rice; pour in the apples, 
lay the remainder of the rice on top, and cover with an ounce and a half of 
pie-paste. Put the timbale into a moderate oven, and cook for thirty 
minutes. When the surface is of a good golden color, remove, and put 
aside to cool thoroughly, leaving it at least two hours. Turn it over onto 
a dessert-dish, remove the mold, and lay the timbale in a short, low, ivide 
freezer; cover, then put it in a tub of nearly the same size, filling it well 
with chopped ice; sprinkle the top and sides freely with rock salt, and 
freeze thoroughly for an hour and a half. Remove the cover carefully 
to avoid any ice or salt falling into the freezer. Take out the timbale, and 
wipe well the dish. Have ready one pint of whipped cream (No. 1254) 
with half a gill of maraschino; beat this well for two minutes. Pour it 
over the timbale, and send immediately to the table. Should there be no 
freezer handy, the timbale may be cooled by placing in the ice-box for 
three hours. 

1176. Croustade de Riz Meringnee. On a floured board roll half a 
pound of feuilletage paste (No. 1076) into an oval shape, and a quarter of 
an inch thick. Lay it upside down on an oval dish ten inches long by six 
wide, and with a knife cut away the superfluous paste. Remove the 
dish, and place the oval paste in a baking-dish; then roll out the pieces 
which were cut away, and with a small fancy paste- cutter (No. i) cut 
it all up. With a small hair pastry-brush dipped in beaten egg, wet the 
edges of the oval, and arrange the pieces all around, crown-shaped. Bake 
this croustade in a moderate oven thirty minutes. Have ready six ounces 
of boiled rice (No. 1172). Peel and core six medium-sized fine apples. 
Put them into a saucepan with two ounces of powdered sugar, a gill of 
cold water, and half a saltspoonful of salt. Put on the lid, and let cook 
on a slow fire for twenty minutes. Arrange half the rice on the croustade, 
dress the apples over, and fill up the cavities with the rest of the rice. 
Add to the juice of the apples in the pan two ounces of apricot marma- 
lade (No. 1335). Mix well for two minutes and pour it over the whole. 
Then set it in a slow oven for fifteen minutes. Remove, and beat up two 
eggs as for a meringue (No. 1247), mixing in two ounces of powdered 
sugar. Put this into a pastry-bag (No. 1079), and decorate the surface of 
the croustade artistically with it, sprinkling a little sugar over. Return 
it to the oven for five minutes, to get a good color. Pass a knife gently 
under the croustade, and dexterously slide it from the baking-pan onto a 
hot dessert-dish, and serve. 



DESSERTS, 339 



1177. Rice with Milk. Cleanse well a quarter of a pound of fine Ital- 
ian rice. Place it in a saucepan with half a pint of water, adding half a 
pinch of salt, the zest of half a lemon, and one bay-leaf. Cook slowly for 
twenty-five minutes. Then put in three tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar and a pint of hot milk; finish cooking on a slow fire for ten minutes, 
and serve in a hot, deep dish. 

1178. Rice a la Turque. Wash well a quarter of a pound of rice, and 
blanch for ten minutes in boiling water. Put it into a saucepan, with a 
pint of milk, and let cook firmly; adding three tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar, and a lump of sugar onto which has been rubbed the peel of half a 
small lemon; also half an ounce of good butter, one ounce of cleaned cur- 
rants (No. 1080), and a saltspoonful of salt. After twenty minutes, 
remove from the fire and thoroughly stir in the yolks of four eggs. Place 
this in a croustade, as for 1176, and put it in a slow oven for fifteen min- 
utes. Remove, sprinkle with a little sugar, pass a hot shovel or salaman- 
der over the top; glaze it well, and serve at once. 

1179. Rice a FIndienne. Prepare the rice as for the above (No. 
1178), adding the third of a glassful of rum and a small infusion of 
diluted powdered saffron, to give it a good color. Serve glazed, as for 
the preceding (No. 1178). 

1180. Rice a la Franchise, Wash well, and blanch in boiling water 
for ten minutes, one-quarter of a pound of Italian rice. Boil in a sauce- 
pan with an ounce of butter, adding three tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar, a pint of milk, two bitter almond macaroons (No. 1209), half a tea- 
spoonful of orange-flower water, half an ounce of candied orange-peel cut 
into shreds, about twelve candied cherries cut into halves, and twelve 
large, seeded, Muscatel raisins (No. 1081); also a quarter of an ounce of 
thin slices of candied angelica. Finish as for rice a la Turque (No. 1178), 
and serve with a sauce thickened with a gill of Alicante or Val-de-peras 
wine, or sherry, kirsch, or rum. 

1181* Rice a la Conde. Boil one pint of milk with one pint of water. 
When boiling, add four ounces of well-cleaned rice. Boil twenty-five 
minutes, stirring at the bottom every three minutes with a spatula. Set 
the saucepan on a table; add half a saltspoonful of salt, four ounces of 
powdered sugar, and six drops of orange-flower water. Mix well for one 
minute, break in three whole eggs, and stir again for two minutes. 
Arrange the rice nicely in a hot dessert-dish, keeping it high in the centre, 
and decorate with twelve pieces of stewed peaches (No. 1332), two ounces 
of dried currants (No. 1080), and one ounce of candied angelica cut in 
small lozenge-shaped pieces; beginning with the peaches on the top, and 
arranging the remainder of the fruit around. 

1182. IVouiUeSj or Noodles. Sift onto a table one pound of flour; make 
a hollow space in the centre, and place therein six egg yolks, half a gill 
of lukewarm water, one ounce of fresh butter, and half a saltspoonful of 
salt. Knead these thoroughly for five minutes; then mix in the flour 
gradually, and knead again for five minutes. Pile up the paste into a 
lump, flour the table slightly, and use the left hand to press the paste

down in the centre, and with the right bring up the edges all around. 
Continue to repeat this for five minutes. Roll the paste into a ball, put 
it on a dish, cover with a napkin, and set it in a cool place to rest for 
fifteen minutes. Roll it out to the thickness of a fifty-cent piece. With a 
knife cut it into strips two inches wide, and from these, beginning at the 
end of each, shred it with the knife into narrow pieces resembling matches. 
Leave these to dry slightly on a floured board for thirty minutes, and they 
will be ready for use. 

1183. Buckwheat Cakes. Dilute one drachm of compressed yeast with 
a gill of lukewarm water, and let it rest for ten minutes. Add it to a half 
pound of buckwheat flour in a basin, pouring in a pint of cold water, and 
season with a light pinch of salt. Mix thoroughly with the spatula, cover 
the basin with a cloth, and let rest for four hours. 

Have a griddle large enough to hold six cakes. Grease lightly with a 
piece of fat pork-rind, and place it on a hot stove. Pour half of the batter 
into the six sections of the griddle, distributing it evenly. Bake two and 
a half minutes, turn over and bake two and a half minutes longer. Heap 
them on a hot dessert-dish. Make the other six exactly the same way. 
Send to the table with honey or maple sugar separately. 

11S4. Wheat Cakes. Put into a vessel four ounces of sifted wheat 
flour, half an ounce of powdered sugar, one drachm of compressed yeast. 
Break in four whole eggs, and mix well with the spatula for three minutes. 
Add half a pint of cold milk, and beat well with the pastry-whip for four 
minutes. Strain through a sieve into another vessel. Place on the stove 
a small griddle, greasing the surface lightly. Drop about two ounces of 
the batter onto the griddle; bake ten seconds; turn it with a cake-turner, 
and bake ten seconds on the other side. See that the cake is a light brown 
color on both sides. Put them on a hot dish, keeping it warm on a corner 
of the range, and proceed to make eleven more with the remainder of the 
batter. Serve very hot, with honey or maple sugar separately. 

1185. Batter for all Kinds of Frying. Put half a pound of flour into 
a basin. Make a hollow in the centre, and drop into it one egg yolk, half 
a teaspoonful of sweet oil, a tablespoonful of brandy, and a light saltspoon- 
ful of salt. Mix all the ingredients, except the flour, for three minutes, 
using the hand. Then gradually knead in the flour, meanwhile dropping 
in, little by little, one gill of cold water. Mix well, moving in the same 
direction for five minutes. Then put it into a vessel, cover with a cloth, 
and set aside to rest for three or four hours. When ready to use, beat 
the whites of three eggs to a froth with a pastry-whip, add it to the batter, 
and mix together thoroughly with the spatula for two minutes. It will 
now be ready for use, but should it not all be required, it will keep in a 
cool place. 

1186, French Pancakes. Sift half a pound of wheat flour into a bowl. 
Break in three whole eggs. Add one ounce of powdered sugar, and mix 
well with the spatula, adding half a pint of cold milk, pouring it in very 
gradually, and mixing for five minutes. Butter lightly a griddle or frying- 
pan; place it on the stove, and when it is hot, drop on to it two and a half 



DES SEATS. 341 



ounces of the batter, and bake two minutes ; turn over, and bake the 
other side as long. Turn the pancake on a hot dessert-dish, and sprinkle 
over plenty of powdered sugar. Make eleven more out of the remaining 
batter. Serve very hot. 

1187. French Pancakes a la Gelee. Make the batter exactly the same 
as for No. 1186. When cooked, arrange the pancakes neatly upon a nap 
kin, and spread over each one about a teaspoonful of currant jelly. Foil 
them up nicely, and dress on a hot dessert-dish, sprinkling a little pow 
dered sugar over. Then, with a red-hot iron, glaze the surface of each cake 
in three different parts ; wipe the sides of the dish nicely, and send to the 
table. 

French pancakes with apple, apricot, plum, pineapple, strawberry, 
raspberry, or peach jelly are to be prepared exactly the same, using differ- 
ent jellies. 

1188. German Pancakes. Prepare a batter as for French pancakes 
(No. 1 1 86) ; butter an iron pan, one foot in diameter and one and a half 
inches deep. Place this on a hot stove, and pour all the batter into it, 
letting it cook for three minutes. Remove to a brisk oven for seven min- 
utes. Take it out, slide the cake carefully on a hot dessert-dish, and send 
it to the table with six pieces of lemon. 

1189. German Pancakes with Apples. Prepare the batter exactly as 
for No. 1 1 86. Butter the pan as for the above. When the batter has been 
poured in, spread over it evenly, one pint of preserved apples, cut into 
small pieces, and finish cooking exactly as for the plain pancake (No. 1188). 
When ready, slide it carefully on a hot dessert-dish, sprinkle plentifully 
with powdered sugar, and send to the table very hot, with six pieces of 
lemon separately. 

1190. Batter for Fritters. Mix a quarter of a pound of sifted flour in 
a small basin, with half a pint of lukewarm water, to which three-quar- 
ters of an ounce of fresh butter has been added. Place in a saucepan, 
which should be tilted on the range so that when the water boils the 
butter can be skimmed off the top. Add, if necessary, a little more water 
to make a soft paste, beating well with a spatula, to keep it free from 
lumps, and of a proper consistence ; it must be gray and compact-looking. 
Add just a little warm water to render the paste soft and diluted, although 
sufficiently thick to cover the objects for which it is intended; that means, 
it must drop easily from the spoon. Add to this half a pinch of salt and 
two egg-whites ; beat well together for one minute, and use at once. 

1191. Apple Fritters. Take three medium-sized, fine, sound apples; 
peel and core them neatly. Cut each into six equal round slices. Place 
them in a vessel, pour over a gill of good brandy, add a light saltspoon- 
ful of ground cinnamon, and let all steep for two hours. Strain them 
through a fine sieve, being careful to keep them whole, and saving the 
liquid for further use. Prepare a fritter batter, as for No. 1190, dip each 
slice separately into it, and with a spoon, drop them singly into very hot 
but not boiling lard, being careful to remove them with a skimmer as 
soon as they are of a good golden color. Two minutes will be sufficient 



342 THE TABLE. 



to have them properly done. Then lay them on a clean cloth, to dry off 
the grease. Arrange a folded napkin on a hot dessert-dish ; arrange the 
fritters on it, and leave it at the oven door for two minutes. Dredge 
about an ounce of powdered sugar over, and serve. 

1192, Fritters Souffles a la Vanille. Infuse in a saucepan half of a 
vanilla-bean in half a pint of boiling milk, and reduce it to half. Remove 
the vanilla-bean, and put in one ounce of good butter. Let it come to a 
boil, then add two ounces of sifted flour, and with the spatula stir briskly, 
to form a paste so stiff that it will no longer adhere to the saucepan. 
Remove it to another vessel. Add one ounce of powdered sugar, two 
egg yolks, and half a saltspoonful of salt. Beat the white of one egg to 
a stiff froth, and mix it in with half a spoonful of whipped cream (No. 
1254); this will form a consistent paste. Roll it on a floured board, 
besprinkle lightly with flour, and cut out pieces the size of a walnut. 
With a skimmer drop them into very hot but not boiling fat. Cook 
quickly for three minutes, until they are a fine golden color. Arrange upon 
a folded napkin, and serve with powdered sugar sifted over. 

1198. Pound Cake. Put in a vessel half a pound of butter, with half 
a pound of powdered sugar. Grate in the rind of half a lemon, and with 
the hand knead well for twenty minutes. Break into a plate five whole 
raw eggs; add gradually and carefully, kneading sharply with the hand 
for ten minutes longer. Now add half a pound of well-sifted flour, mix- 
ing the whole slowly and thoroughly for five minutes more. Butter a 
two-quart, round cake-mold, and line it with brown paper at the bottom 
and sides. Fill it with the preparation, and put it in a slow oven to bake 
for fully one hour. Remove, and let cool off for about two hours. 
Unmold, detach the paper, and lay it on a pastry wire-grate. Glaze the 
top and sides with a preparation as for vanilla eclairs (No. 1245). Lay the 
cake on a dessert-dish with a fancy white paper. Prepare three ounces of 
candied cherries, two ounces of angelica, two ounces of red and the same 
of white pears, both candied; cut the cherries in two, the angelica lozenge- 
shaped, and the pears each in six parts (except one white one, which is 
kept whole), keeping the fruits all separate. Place the whole pear on top 
of the cake in the centre, stem upward. Then decorate thus : at the base 
of the pear lay two slices of red pear, carefully, one against the other on 
one side. Repeat on the other side, and arrange ^in the same way two 
slices of the white pear in the middle of the space on one side, and two 
more slices opposite. Now cover the four empty spaces nearest the pear 
with half a cherry each, and arrange four angelica lozenges in the empty 
place at the end of the layers of pear. Then on each of the four angelica 
points lay half a cherry. Begin decorating the edge of the cake all around 
in a crown-shape with one angelica lozenge, putting near the point one 
half cherry, then another lozenge, and continue the same all around until 
joined. Arrange the remaining slices of pear in the empty space near the 
border, and it will be ready to send to the table. 

1194. Wedding" Cake. Place in a large bowl one pound of powdered 
ugar and one pound of well-washed butter. Grate in the rind of two 



DESSERTS. 343 



lemons; and with the hand knead well for ten minutes. Break in ten 
whole eggs, two at a time, and knead for ten minutes longer. Mix in a 
plate a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, a teaspoonful of ground cloves, 
two of ground allspice, one of mace, and one of grated nutmeg, and add 
these, with half a gill of confectioners' molasses. Mix well for one min- 
ute with the hand. Add one pound of well-sifted flour, stirring for two 
minutes more. Add two pounds of currants, as for No. 1080, two pounds 
of Sultana (No. 1080), two pounds of Malaga raisins (No. 1081), one 
pound of candied citron, finely sliced, one gill of Jamaica rum, and one 
gill of brandy. Mix the whole well together for fifteen minutes using 
both hands, if necessary. Butter the interior of a plain, five-quart, round 
cake-mold. Line the bottom and sides with paper, leaving it an inch and 
a half higher than the edge of the mold. Pour in all the preparation, and 
place it in a very slow oven to bake for five hours. When done, lay it on 
a table, to cool off for four hours. Unmold, detach the paper, and turn 
the cake bottom up on a wire pastry-grate. After ten minutes, glaze it 
with one egg-white which has been beaten in a bowl with four ounces of 
extra fine sugar, using the spatula; use a knife to apply the glazing. 
Now lay the cake in a warm place to dry for two hours. Then beat up 
the white of an egg with four ounces of extra fine sugar for ten minutes, 
and glaze the cake as before, evenly all around, and lay aside for two 
hours more. After it is thoroughly dried, lay it on a round wooden board, 
with a fancy paper over, two inches wider than the board. Procure a 
fancy wedding-bell, with a miniature bride and groom standing under, lay 
it in the centre of the cake, fastening it on with glace royale (No. 1206), 
pressing it through a paper cornet with a fancy tube. Decorate the sur- 
face of the cake with ornaments made of the glace; also a fancy border 
around the edge and base. Let it dry slightly for two hours, and it is 
ready for use. 

1195. Sponge Cake. Put into a copper basin half a pound of pow- 
dered sugar. Break in seven whole eggs, and grate in the rind of half a 
lemon. Beat well together with the wire whip for one minute ; then 
place it on a slow fire and heat it slightly, stirring it sharply and continu- 
ally. Take it from the fire, and beat it well until thoroughly cold. Re- 
move the whip, and with a skimmer mix in carefully and slowly half a 
pound of well-sifted flour; two minutes and a half will be sufficient. But- 
ter the interior of a one-quart, round cake-mold, and line it with paper, 
keeping it an inch and a half higher than the mold. Then fill it with the 
preparation, and bake for one hour and fifteen minutes in a moderate 
oven. Let it cool thoroughly for two hours; unmold, place it on a pastry 
wire-grate, and glaze it the same as for vanilla eclairs (No. 1245). Deco- 
rate artistically with a glace royale (No. 1206), arranging it in any desired 
fanciful design. Serve on a dessert-dish covered with a fancy paper. 

1196. Waffles, with Sugar. Put in a vessel three ounces of powdered 
sugar, one pound of flour, three raw eggs, three ounces of melted butter; 
mix all well together with a spatula for five minutes. Add a pint and a 
half of sweet cream, and mix again well for two minutes. Have your 



344 



THE TABLE. 



waffle-iron hot on both sides, and on a clear fire. Grease with melted 
butter, using a feather for the purpose, and drop into each of the holes 
two tablespoonfuls of the paste. Bake two minutes on each side, and if 
they have not a good golden color bake one minute longer on each side. 
Heap them as fast as cooked on a hot dessert-dish. When all are done, 
besprinkle plentifully with powdered sugar, and serve very hot. 

1197. Savarin Cakes. Dissolve two drachms of compressed yeast in 
a gill of lukewarm cream. Add four ounces of sifted flour, knead well 
for two minutes, and set in a warm place for five minutes. Sift into 
another vessel six ounces of flour. Make a hollow in the centre, and 
pour into it two ounces of powdered sugar, four eggs, a gill of lukewarm 
milk, and a saltspoonful of salt. Knead these well for two minutes, but 
do not mix in the flour. Add three ounces of melted butter and half a 
gill of cura^oa (or any other liquor desired), then knead in the flour with 
the other ingredients, adding the yeast-dough previously laid aside, and 
mix with the hands, briskly beating the whole in a contrary direction for 
twenty minutes without ceasing. Cover with a cloth, and set in a warm 
closet to raise double, which will take about half an hour. Butter a 
crown-shaped mold holding about three pints. When ready, take two 
ounces of peeled almonds (No. 1207), mince fine, and add them to the 
dough, and beat well together for two minutes longer. Then with a 
spoon drop the paste carefully into the mold ; this not being quite filled 
to the top. Set aside again in the warm closet until the paste raises to 
the edge ; then place in a moderately brisk oven for twenty-five minutes. 
Should the oven be slow, thirty-five minutes will be necessary. To 
ascertain whether the cake be perfectly baked, thrust the point of a lard- 
ing-needle into the centre, and should any dough adhere to it, the cake 
must be left in five minutes longer. 

When done, turn it out on a plain, round wire grate, and glaze it with 
a firm glace a 1'eau made as follows : put into a sugar-pan one ounce of 
granulated sugar, with one tablespoonful of cold water, and let it come to 
a boil ; remove, and add immediately a tablespoonful of cura^oa, mixing 
well together. Glaze the cake with this, then let cool. Place a folded 
napkin on a dessert-dish, dress the cake nicely on top, and serve. 

1198. Savarin Cake, hot. -Prepare a savarin cake exactly as for the 
above (No. 1197), and when unmolded, place it on a wire grate, but do 
not glaze it. Pour into a saucepan a pint of cold water with five ounces 
of granulated sugar, and let boil for five minutes. Take it off, and add 
immediately half a gill of kirsch, mixing it in well. Place the grate with 
the savarin in a vessel, take hold of the handle with the right hand, and 
drop the syrup carefully all over the top; lift up the grate and cake. Re- 
move the syrup remaining in the vessel into the pan, boil it again; return 
the grate and cake to the vessel, and pour over the remaining syrup. 
Then, lifting the grate on one side, glide the cake carefully onto a dessert- 
dish. Put into a saucepan four ounces of candied cherries with half a gill 
of kirsch. Stir it slightly until it comes to a boil and decorate the top of 
the cake with it ; then serve.

1199. Savarin Cake a 1'Anglaise. Prepare a savarin cake as for No. 
1197; when unmolded, place it on a wire grate ; do not glaze it. Cut it 
evenly through the centre, so as to make two equal discs. Garnish the 
top of the under one with four ounces of apricot marmalade (No. 1335); 
arrange the other half on top as carefully as possible, so that the cake has 
its original form. Have a dessert-dish with a folded napkin ; dress the 
cake on top, and serve with a sauce-bowl of creme a 1'Anglaise (No. 1200) 
separately. 

1200. Creme & 1'Anglaise. Put into a saucepan two ounces of butter 
and one ounce of flour. Place on a slow fire, and with a spatula stir 
slightly for two minutes, adding two ounces of sugar, half a gill of 
Madeira wine, and one gill of Middletown milk; stir well again for two 
minutes, to avoid its coming to a boil. Then take it from the fire, and 
immediately add half a gill of rum, stirring it slightly again. Pour the 
creme into a sauce-bowl and serve with the savarin. 

1201. Brioches. Take half a pound of sifted flour, put two ounces of 
it into a vessel. Make a hollow in the centre, and put into this two 
drachms of compressed yeast and half a gill of lukewarm milk. Dissolve 
well the yeast with the milk for about one minute, then quickly beat in 
the flour for one minute. Cover the vessel with a cloth, and let it rest in 
a warm closet for fifteen minutes. Put in another vessel the remaining 
six ounces of flour, make a hollow in the centre, and put into it half a 
saltspoonful of salt, three whole eggs, two tablespoonfuls of sweet cream, 
two ounces of fresh butter, and one ounce of powdered sugar. Mix 
thoroughly with the hand, all except the flour, for three minutes, men 
incorporate the flour gradually, and beat it sharply with the hands for three 
minutes. Add one egg, beat one minute; add another, and beat one min- 
ute longer. Take four ounces of fresh butter, spread it in pieces over the 
paste, then mix in well for two minutes. The yeast being properly raised 
double by this time, add it to the other ingredients, and mix the whole 
carefully by cutting it several times with the hand, being sure to repeat 

,this for at least five minutes. Cover the vessel with a cloth, and lay it in 
a closet or elsewhere, at a moderate temperature of about*eighty degrees, 
for three hours, when it will be raised to twice the size. Then with the 
right hand cut it again into pieces in every direction, for about four min- 
utes. Then recover the vessel with the cloth, and leave it in a cool 
place for thirty minutes. Dredge a board with flour, pour the paste over 
it; then cut off a three-ounce piece, and lay it aside. With the hands roll 
up the remaining part of the paste into a ball. .. Butter well a round, two- 
quart mold, line it with paper, and put in the paste. Take the piece laid 
aside, and roll it pear-shaped with the hands. Make a small cavity in the 
centre of the paste in the mold, using a spoon. Arrange the pear-shaped 
piece in this, having the larger part on top. Then lay the mold on a 
baking-sheet ; glaze the top lightly with beaten egg, and put it in a 
moderate oven. After it has been in fifteen minutes, cover it with a 
buttered paper, close the oven door, and bake lor one hour more , test it 
by thrusting in a larding-needle, and if no dough adheres to this the brioche

is thoroughly cooked: if not, leave it in ten minutes longer. Remove 
from the oven, unmold, and let it cool. Dress on a dessert-dish with a 
folded napkin, and serve. 

1202. Small Brioches. Prepare the dough as for the above (No. 
1201), and when raised to twice the size, lay it upon a board which has 
been lightly dredged with flour. Cut out a piece of three ounces, and lay 
it aside until needed, then cut the rest of the paste into twelve equal 
pieces, and with the right hand roll them into separate balls. Lay these 
in a pastry baking-pan. Divide the paste laid aside into twelve parts, roll 
them out, and give each a pear-shape. With a spoon make a cavity in the 
centre of each ball, and put into each one of the pear pieces, having the 
larger part on the top. Leave them to rise in a closet for fifteen minutes; 
glaze them lightly with beaten egg, and put them in a brisk oven for twelve 
or fifteen minutes, but no longer. Remove, and with a light hair-brush 
glaze them all over with fresh butter. Keep in a warm place until ready 
to serve. If the brioches should be required cold, do not glaze them with 
butter, but dress them on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin. It is better 
to prepare the paste the evening previous, covering it with a cloth, and 
leaving it in a cool place over night. 

1203. Brioche a la Conde. Have a brioche cooked as for No. 1201, 
and when done, cut it in two, crosswise. Then with a spoon spread over 
the top of the lower half four ounces of apricot marmalade (No. 1335), 
mixed with one ounce of melted butter. Then replace the other half on 
top. Put in a saucepan two ounces of candied cherries, four ounces of 
candied apricots, cut in slices, and four ounces of candied pineapple. Add 
half a pint of cold water, and boil well together on a hot fire for three 
minutes. Dress the brioche on a dessert-dish, pour the preparation over, 
and serve hot. 

1204. Brioches Flllttes. Prepare a brioche paste, as for No. 1203 ; 
lay it on a floured board, and cut it into twelve equal pieces. Roll out 
each one separately with the hands until it is ten inches, or three finger- 
lengths, long, rounding them into shape. Put them in a pastry baking- 
pan, and leave them in a closet to rise for ten minutes ; take out and 
glaze them lightly with beaten eggs, sprinkle them over with powdered 
sugar, and put them in the oven for ten minutes ; remove, and dress them 
on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve when cool. These 
brioches will keep well for three or four days, and they are delicious 
when served with tea, coffee, or chocolate. 

1205. Allumettes. Take three quarters of a pound of feuilletage (No. 
1076) ; spread it out twelve inches long to four inches wide. Cover with 
a thin layer of glace royale (No. 1206). Divide it into six even pieces ; 
put them in a pan, and let rest for five minutes. Then place in a moder- 
ate oven, and bake for forty minutes, until of a good golden color. Serve 
either hot or cold. 

1206. Glace Eoyale for Allumettes. Put into a small bowl half the 
white of a raw egg and two ounces of extra fine sugar, and beat well, 
with a spatula. Drop in carefully just one drop, and no more, of lemon

juice; beat again for five minutes, until thickened; it will then be ready 
for use. 

1207. How to Peel and Pound Almonds. Put the almonds into boil- 
ing water; let them soak three minutes; strain, and lay them in cold 
water to thoroughly cool. 'Drain well again, and peel by pressing each 
almond between the thumb and fingers. Then put them into a sieve, and 
place them at the door of a slow oven to dry for ten minutes. Now pound 
them gently in a mortar, stirring well to prevent them from getting oily, 
and taking care to pound them very fine for at least ten minutes. Lay 
them on a cold dish, and use when needed. 

1208. Almond Cake Grlace. Put a quarter of a pound of powdered 
sugar and a quarter of a pound of butter into a bowl; beat well together 
with a wooden spatula for ten minutes. Break in two eggs; beat well, 
and break in two more; continue beating, and break in two more (six in 
all), until well mixed together. Then grate in the peel of the third of a 
small lemon. Add two ounces of peeled and pounded almonds (No. 1207), 
and a quarter of a pound of flour. Mix gradually together for no longer 
than two minutes. Butter and sugar a round form holding one quart, 
and pour the preparation into it. Place it in a slow oven for one hour. 
See that it gets a good golden color. Take it out; let it get thoroughly 
cool, and remove from the mold. Lay it on a dish with a folded napkin. 
Glaze the top lightly with a small hair-bush, as for No. 1206, until it 
looks well, and send to the table. 

1209. Bitter Almond Macaroons. Take a quarter of a pound of sweet 
almonds, and two ounces of bitter almonds; peel and pound them as for 
No. 1307. Put them into a bowl with twelve ounces of powdered sugar 
and the whites of two eggs. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spatula for 
at least five minutes. Then take a pastry-bag (No. 1079), slide down to 
the bottom of it a No. 3 tube (which should not be larger than a five-cent 
piece), and pour the preparation into the bag. Prepare a pastry baking- 
pan; lay on it a piece of brown paper the full size of the pan (do not put 
it on the stove at present); then with the two hands press the preparation 
down gently into the papered pan, dropping it carefully into bits the size 
and shape of a silver quarter-dollar, trying to have them as near alike as 
possible, and taking care that each is entirely separated from the others. 
Take a damp towel and drop it gently on to the macaroons, so as to shape 
them perfectly. Then place the pan in a slow oven for twenty minutes. 
Before lifting them out, be careful that they are a good golden color. Let 
them get thoroughly cool. To remove the macaroons easily from the 
paper, wet part of a table; lay the paper over this for two minutes, and 
the macaroons will detach very easily. The above quantity will make 
about fifty macaroons. Put aside in a jar those not needed, as they will 
keep perfectly fresh for several days. 

1210. Sweet Macaroons. Proceed as for bitter macaroons (No. 1209), 
only omitting the two ounces of bitter almonds, and substituting for them 
two extra ounces of sweet almonds, or six ounces in all. 

1211. Apple Cake. Peel and core four fine, sound pippin apples. 



THE TABLE. 



Put them into a saucepan with two ounces of boiled and peeled chestnuts, 
and a piece of cinnamon an inch long. Toss well on the fire for ten min- 
utes, then transfer them to a copper basin, stirring in a teaspoonful of 
corn-starch, and adding a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar. Place 
on a slow stove for ten minutes, then put aside. When thoroughly 
cooled, add three egg yolks and one whole one ; mix well with a wooden 
spatula, and the preparation will be ready for use. Take a three-pint, 
square mold, butter it lightly, and with a small hair-brush sprinkle in a 
little powdered sugar, and pour in the prepared apple. Place the mold io 
a tin pastry-pan, filling the latter to half the height of the mold with cold 
water,' and place the whole in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. Take 
the mold from the pan, and lay on top of it a hot, deep dessert-dish, 
slightly larger than the cake ; turn the mold bottom up, and lift it off, 
leaving the cake on the dish. While the cake is in the oven, prepare the 
following sauce : mix in a saucepan two egg yolks, one ounce of pow- 
dered sugar, half a pint of water, and half a teaspoonful of ground cinna- 
mon. Place on a brisk fire, and stir constantly for five minutes, not 
allowing it to boil. When the cream is ready, add half a glassful or a 
gill of rum, or any other kind of liquor. Mix well for half a minute, pour 
the sauce over the cake, and serve very hot. 

1212. St. Honors ll la Rose Delmonico. Peel neatly two medium- 
sized, sound, red oranges. Separate the sections carefully to avoid tear- 
ing the skin, as, should they lose any of their juice, they would become 
useless. Lay a sheet of paper over a tin pan, arrange the pieces of 
orange on top, and leave them in a warm place to dry for four hours. 
Wipe neatly twenty-four Malaga grapes, leaving on each about a quarter 
of an inch of stem, so that they shall remain firm while using them. Beat 
up a pint and a half of sweet cream a la vanille as for No. 1254, and lay it 
aside in a cool place until needed. Roll three ounces of pie-paste (No. 
1077) into a round piece eight inches in diameter. Lay it on a baking- 
sheet ten inches wide, and proceed to prepare a pate-a-chou as follows : 

Put into a saucepan a gill of cold milk with one ounce of good butter, 
place it on a hot fire, and when boiling, add at once three ounces of well- 
sifted flour. Stir briskly with the spatula all round ; take it from the 
fire, set on a table, and add immediately a saltspocnful of powdered 
sugar, mixing well for one minute more. Break in an egg, stir briskly 
for one minute, break in another, mix again, and then another, mixing all 
together for two minutes. Slide down the pastry-bag (No. 1079) a tube 
(No. 3), pour in the above preparation, and press down the top with the 
hands onto the edge of the paste in the baking-sheet, so as to make an even 
border half an inch high, and with the remainder of the paste press down 
onto another baking-sheet into twenty-four small, round choux, half an inch 
in diameter, leaving them one inch apart. Glaze the surfaces with beaten 
egg, and place them in a brisk oven to bake for twelve minutes. Remove, 
and let them get thoroughly cold. Spread over the paste, inside the bor- 
der, two tablespoonfuls of apple sauce (No. 1328); then put it in a mod- 
erate oven to bake for twenty-five minutes. Remove, and put to cool for 



DESSERTS. 349 



thirty minutes. Make a paper cornet, cut off a quarter of an inch from 
the point, and put into it three ounces of currant jelly (No. 1326). Press 
this out gently, dividing it evenly into the twenty-four small choux. 
Cook one pound of granulated sugar as for No. 1264. Oil two square 
feet of the surface of a marble table, and place at hand the pan containing 
the sugar. Plunge one of the grapes into this ; remove it immediately 
with a fork and lay it on the oiled table. Proceed the same with the other 
twenty-three, being careful to lay them one inch apart from each oth?r. 
Now dip twelve of the sections of prepared oranges into the sugar, one by 
one, and lay them on the oiled table exactly the same as the grapes. Dip 
carefully the surfaces of the small choux into the sugar, and lay them on 
the same oiled table. Then take the St. Honore bottom in the baking- 
sheet, and proceed to arrange it as follows : with the cooked sugar stand- 
ing on the right, lift the choux up, one by one, dipping one side of each 
lightly in the cooked sugar, arranging them on top of the pate-a-chou 
border close together to form a crown. Should the sugar be too thick, 
return it to the stove, and let it boil up once ; then take it off, and dip the 
thin part of the oranges lightly in it, and lay them over the small choux, 
the thick part upward, each one adhering to the other, until they form 
the crown. Dip the tops of the grapes lightly into the same sugar, 
and place one on each join of the oranges, with another in the centre, the 
stems being upward ; attach to the small choux the six remaining grapes, 
dividing them evenly. Arrange a fancy paper on a dessert-dish, and lay 
the St. Honore over carefully, then take the froth part only of the 
whipped cream ; transfer it to another vessel, and, with the whip, beat 
briskly for five minutes, adding half a gill of good cognac, a quarter of a 
gill of Swiss kirsch, and three ounces of well-pounded and sifted maca- 
roons (No. 1210). Mix well together for two minutes longer, and fill the 
empty space of the St. Honore with three-quarters of this preparation, 
keeping it as high as possible. With the use of the pastry-bag and fancy 
tube press down the rest of the cream, and decorate artistically the top 
and sides, taking care not to put any on the oranges, and send to the 
table. 

1213. Gingerbread a la Franchise. Make a hollow space in a pound 
of flour laid on the table. Peel and chop up very fine five ounces of 
almonds; put them into the hollow with a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, 
the same quantity of ground cloves, four ounces of powdered sugar, and 
seven ounces of fresh honey. Knead the ingredients well for five minutes, 
then mix in the flour, and knead the preparation with the hands in all 
directions for fully thirty minutes without ceasing. Finish by forming it 
into a ball. Lay this on a dish, cover it with a napkin, and place it in a 
temperature of about 60 for six hours. Lay the paste on a floured table, 
and roll it out eighteen inches long by twelve wide. Butter well a baking- 
sheet, lay the paste on top, and put it in a very slow oven to bake for 
forty-five minutes. Remove, lay the baking-sheet on the table, cutthecake 
immediately into small pieces, lozenge shaped, one and a half inches long 
by one inch wide, or any other shape desired; let cool off thoroughly for 



350 THE TABLE. 



about twenty minutes, then dress on a glass bowl, and serve. The above 
cakes can be glazed with a glace a 1'eau, as for No. 1197, and served the 
same. 

1214. Strawberry Shortcake. Put into a vessel half a pound of 
powdered sugar with half a pound of well-washed butter, grate in the 
rind of half a sound lemon, and, with the hand, mix well for ten minutes. 
Break in five whole eggs, one at a time, meanwhile mixing for ten min- 
utes longer, always with the hand. Then add gradually half a pound of 
well-sifted flour, and mix for three minutes. Cover a baking-sheet with 
brown paper, place on top three tin cake-rings, nine inches in diameter 
and one inch high. Divide the preparation equally into the three rings; 
then place in a moderate oven to bake for thirty minutes. Remove, and 
allow the cakes thirty minutes more to cool. Lift up the paper, with the 
cakes, turn it upside down on the table, remove the paper, and detach the 
cakes from the rings by passing a knife all around. Pick and clean thor- 
oughly three pints of fine, sound, ripe strawberries; have a dessert-dish 
with a fancy paper over, lay one of the cakes on top of this, spread over 
eve-nly two tablespoonfuls of whipped cream (No. 1254), then cover 
with half the strawberries, nicely and evenly divided. Sprinkle liberally 
with powdered sugar, then cover with another cake, spread over the same 
quantity of cream as before, then arrange the other half of the strawber- 
ries on top; dredge again with powdered sugar, and lay the last cake over 
all, sprinkling with more sugar. Slide down a tube (No. 2) into a pastry- 
bag (No. 1079), put into it six tablespoonfuls of whipped cream a la vanille 
(No. 1254), and with it decorate the top of the cake in an artistic manner, 
and send to the table. 

1215. Blackberry Shortcake. Prepare and proceed exactly the 
same as for strawberry shortcake (No. 1214), only substituting three pints 
of well-picked, and thoroughly cleaned, fine, sound, ripe blackberries for 
the strawberries, and serving the same. 

1216. Baba. Have ready half a pound of the best flour, one drachm 
of compressed yeast, and half a gill of warm water. Put three ounces of 
the flour into a vessel, make a hollow in the centre, and in it lay the yeast 
and water; with the hands mix the yeast gently with the water for three 
minutes, then mix all together gradually for three minutes more. 
Cover the vessel with a towel, and leave it in the warmest 
place in the kitchen (not on the stove), and after thirty minutes it will 
rise to twice the size. Lay the remainder of the flour on the table, make 
a hollow in the centre, putting in it an ounce of powdered sugar and four 
raw eggs. Mix the sugar and eggs with the hands; then add a gill of 
cream and half a gill of good Madeira wine. Season with a drachm of 
very fine salt, and mix all with the flour for five minutes. Make a hollow 
in the centre again, and into this put five ounces of good, fresh, soft butter; 
mix well again for two minutes. If the prepared yeast-dough be now 
raised to its proper height, mix the two pastes together for at least five 
minutes; return it to the vessel, leave it in the same warm place, covering 
it as before. When rested one hour, have ready two ounces of cleaned 



DES SEATS. 351 



Sultana currants (No. 1080), two ounces of cleaned raisins (No. io8i),and 
one ounce of finely chopped citron. Grease with cold butter the inside of 
a cylindrical copper or tin form large enough to hold three pints. If the 
paste be now raised to twice the size, mix in the raisins, currants, and 
citron, stirring for five minutes; put it in the mold, and lay it in a warm 
place (not on the stove) for another twenty minutes. Then place it in a 
moderate oven for one hour. When a good golden color, remove, and let 
it cool slightly. Place a round dish over the mold, turn upside down, 
lift off the form, and glaze the cake with a glace a 1'eau (No. 1197). Deco- 
rate the top and dish with candied fruits, and send to the table. 

1217. Baba ail Madere. Prepare a baba cake exactly the same as for 
the above (No. 1216); but do not glaze it. Slit the cake in two, and remove 
the top piece. Pour a pint of cold water in a very clean pan, add half a 
pound of sugar and half a medium-sized sound lemon. Place it on the 
stove, and boil well for three minutes; then remove, and at once add a 
gill of good sherry wine and half a gill of curaoa. Lay the top part of 
the cake in a round, flat-bottomed vessel. To avoid breaking it, a wire 
basket is recommended, with which it can be lowered carefully onto the 
pan. Pour gradually over it the prepared sauce; let it rest for two min- 
utes, then replace it carefully on top of the other half of the cake. 
Arrange it nicely on a dessert serving-dish, garnish tastefully with can- 
died cherries, and decorate the border with small, thin slices of candied 
pineapple. 

For Baba au Rhum, substitute Jamaica rum for the sherry. 

1218. Baba, Creme a la Vanille. Prepare a baba cake as for No. 
1216. When removed from the mold and laid on a dish, cut it into six 
equal parts. Take six ounces of apricot marmalade (No. 1335), and pro- 
ceed as follows : take one piece of cake in the left hand, and with a knife 
in the right, cover both sides, where they were cut, with the marmalade. 
When finished, arrange the six pieces together on the dish, and give them 
the same form as before they were cut; to be eaten with the following 
sauce (No. 1219). 

1219. Creme a la Yanille Sauce. Boil one pint of cold milk in a 
saucepan; put three egg yolks into a small vessel with two ounces of pow- 
dered sugar, one ounce of flour, and a piece of vanilla-bean one inch long. 
Beat well together with a wire whip for two minutes. Pour this into the 
boiling milk. Stir again briskly with the whip until it boils once more; 
remove from the fire, and add half a f gill of maraschino. Beat again for 
one minute, and pour the cream nicely over the cake before sending to 
the table. 

1220. Home-made Cake. Put into a bowl half a pound of sugar and 
half a pound of good butter. Mix thoroughly with the hand for fifteen 
minutes. Break four eggs, leaving the whites in a basin, and drop the 
yolks in with the butter and sugar. Mix again. Now beat the whites to 
a froth and add them to the other ingredients. Grate in half a saltspoon- 
ful of nutmeg; add half a pound of flour; mix well again; stir in two 
ounces of well-cleansed currants (No. 1080), and two ounces of peeled 



352 THE TABLE. 



sweet almonds (No. 1207) out into small pieces. Mingle all well together 
with the hand for five minutes, and with the other hand drop in one gill 
of brandy. Have a round cake-mold holding two quarts; butter it lightly 
with a hair brush, and sprinkle in a little sugar. Drop a third of the 
preparation into the mold; spread over it two ounces of candied orange, 
shred into thin slices; then add half of the remaining preparation; spread 
on top of it two ounces of shred, candied citron, and fill the mold with the 
rest. Lay a piece of brown paper over, and put the mold into a very mod- 
erate oven for two hours. Let it get a good golden color. Remove, and 
cool off in the mold, which will take about three hours. Remove the cake 
by turning it bottom up. Arrange a lace paper on a dessert-dish. Glaze 
the cake with a glace a 1'eau (No. 1197), dress it on the dish, and deco- 
rate the top and border tastefully with assorted candied fruits. 

1221. Plain Galette. Knead well and finely together in a vessel one 
pound of good flour with six ounces of fresh butter, one gill of cold water, 
and a saltspoonful of salt. After ten minutes, when it becomes soft, roll 
it into a flat, circular cake using a rolling-pin, well floured, to prevent 
its adhering. Place it in a baking-pan. Bake in a very slow oven for 
thirty-five minutes. When a nice light color, remove and let it cool. Serve 
it on a dessert-dish, over a folded napkin. 

1222* Rice Cake. Boil two ounces of rice for twenty-five minutes. 
When well done, drain, and add to it a short paste, made of half a pound 
of flour, six ounces of butter, two egg-whites, and half a saltspoonful of 
salt. Pound the paste and rice well together in a mortar, and have a bak- 
ing-pan covered with a sheet of buttered paper; lay the paste on top, 
spreading it out about six inches square. Put it in the oven for twenty 
minutes. Remove it, detach it from the paper, lay it on a dessert-dish, 
with a folded napkin, and serve hot. 

Vermicelli cake is prepared the same way, only the vermicelli should 
not cook longer than twelve minutes. 

1223. Mille-feuilles Cake. Take a pound of short paste or feuille- 
tage (No. 1076), and divide it into five equal parts. Roll out each piece 
twelve inches long by four wide, then lay them in a baking-pan, sprinkle 
a little powdered sugar over, and place them in the oven for ten minutes. 
Remove, and form the cake by laying these one on top of the other, with 
layers of preserves between, each layer being of different colored pre- 
serves. Put the fifth piece on top of the last layer for a cover. Then cut 
the cake into six equal pieces ; decorate either with different colored pre- 
serves, or with whipped cream (No. 1254), and serve on a dessert-dish 
with a folded napkin. 

1224. Almond Cake* Make a plain paste in a vessel with four ounces 
of butter, three egg yolks, half a pound of well-sifted flour, four ounces 
of powdered sugar, a quarter of a pound of finely pounded almonds (No. 
1207), a saltspoonful of salt, and about six drops of orange-flower water. 
Mix and stir well for five minutes. It will then be of a proper consistency, 
spread it round about eight, inches in diameter on a buttered paper in a 
pan, and with a light hair-brush moisten the surface slightly with beaten

egg. Bake twenty minutes. Remove, detach from the paper, set away 
to cool, and serve. 

1225. Cake de Pitlliviers. Put in a vessel four ounces of pounded 
almonds (No. 1207), half a pound of powdered sugar, two ounces of 
chopped, candied lemon-peel, and a quarter of a pound of good, fresh but- 
ter. Mix in gradually four eggs, well beaten, and finish as for the almond 
cake (No. 1224), serving it the same. 

1226. Madeleine. Rub the rind of two small lemons on a lump of 
sugar ; crush it very fine with a roller, mixing three ounces of powdered 
sugar with it. Put two ounces of this into a saucepan with two ounces of 
sifted flour, one egg yolk, and two whole eggs, two teaspoonfuls of good 
brandy, and half a saltspoonful of salt. Stir all together with a wooden 
spatula, and after two minutes, when the paste is well mixed, stir it again 
for one minute only. Put two ounces of good butter into a separate sauce- 
pan ; as soon as the scum rises, stir it carefully for one minute, and let it 
cool slightly. Then spread it well over the sides of a three-pint made- 
leine-mold. Put the saucepan containing the preparation on a very slow 
fire ; stir slightly to prevent it adhering to the bottom of the sauce- 
pan, and as soon as it becomes liquid take it off, and fill the mold. Lay it 
in a moderately heated oven for forty-five minutes ; remove, and let cool. 
Unmold it on a dessert-dish over a folded napkin, and serve. 

1227. Madeleine Printaniere. Prepare the cake as for the above 
(No. 1226) until the mold is ready to be filled. Butter the interiors of 
twelve small madeleine-molds, fill them with the preparation, lay them on 
a pastry baking-pan, and place them in a moderate oven for twenty min- 
utes. Remove, let them cool, unmold, and turn them up-side down ; cut 
a piece from the thinnest part of the top of each madeleine to serve as a 
cover. With a dessert-spoon scoop out of each madeleine a cavity one 
inch deep, fill this with a plombiere a la vanille (No. 1294). Replace the 
covers, lay them on a wire grate, and, withabrush, glaze gently with glace 
a 1'eau (No. 1197), flavored with two tablespoonfuls of strawberry juice, 
and sprinkle over with three ounces of well-chopped pistache. Place in 
the oven for one minute more ; then dress on a dessert-dish with a folded 
napkin, and serve. 

1228. Milan Cake. One pound of flour, half a pound of butter, half 
a pound of powdered sugar, and four whole eggs. Sift the flour on the 
table. Make a hollow in the centre, and fill it with the sugar and butter, 
and the grated rind of a lemon. Knead well the butter and sugar for 
three minutes ; add the eggs, one at a time, and incorporate the flour 
slowly, so as not to burn the paste. Let it rest for about half an hour in a 
cool place. Then roll out about a quarter of an inch thick. Cut out six 
pieces with a round cake-cutter ; glaze the surfaces with beaten .egg and 
milk, and bake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. When cold, dress 
on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve. Keep the rest of the 
paste for further use, as it will remain sweet and fresh for two or three 
days. 

1229. Rum Cake. Half a pound of flour, two ounces of sugar, three

,54 THE TABLE. 



whole eggs, one ounce of butter, and two drachms of compressed yeast. 
Sift the flour on a board. Take one third of it ; make a hollow in its 
centre, and put into it the yeast and half a gill of warm milk. When the 
yeast is dissolved, mix well for one minute. Then put it into a bowl, 
cover with a cloth, and let it rise in a warm place until twice the size. Take 
the rest of the flour, make a hollow in the centre, and put into it the 
sugar, eggs, and six drops of orange-flower water. Knead well together, 
slowly incorporating the flour ; then gradually add the butter and the 
prepared yeast-dough. Mix all together for five minutes ; return to the 
bowl, and again lay it aside to rise to twice its -size. Butter well six 
round rum-cake molds, fill them about three quarters high with the 
dough, and let it rise until they are full; then lay them on a baking-pan 
in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. When well browned, remove, 
unmold, place them on a pastry-wire, and pour over them a sauce made 
thus : put a quarter of a pound of sugar in a saucepan with half a pint 
of water, adding half a sliced lemon. When boiling, take from the fire, 
and pour in half a gill of rum, then throw it over the cakes. Dress on a 
dish, and serve. 

1230. Rice Cake h la Mazzini. Put a pint of cold milk into a sauce- 
pan on a hot stove, and when it boils add half a pound of well-cleaned 
rice and let it cook slowly for twenty minutes, stirring frequently to the 
bottom with a spatula. Then set the saucepan in a cool place for thirty 
minutes. Add six ounces of powdered sugar ; mix well for one minute, 
and break in three whole eggs ; flavor with eight drops of orange-flower 
water, mixing well together for three minutes longer. Take a quarter of 
a pound of pie-paste (No. 1077), roll it out very thin, and with it line a 
three-pint, round, channeled mold ; fill it with the preparation, and place 
it in a moderate oven to bake for forty minutes. Remove, and let it 
become thoroughly cold, which will take an hour. Then unmold, and lay 
the cake over a round pastry - grate. Have a quarter of a pound of 
vanilla eclair glazing (No. 1245), put it in a saucepan, adding a teaspoon- 
ful of cold water. Place it on the hot range, and with a spatula mix it 
gently and thoroughly until it becomes lukewarm ; then pour it over the 
cake. Arrange the cake on a dessert-dish, and serve. 

1231. Biscuits h la Cuillere, or Lady-fingers. Put four ounces of 
powdered sugar and the yolks of five eggs into a small bowl. Beat thor- 
oughly with a spatula for five minutes. Put the whites of the eggs into 
a copper basin, and with a wire whip beat them to a stiff froth. Add to 
the sugar and yolks four ounces of flour ; mix together gently for half a 
minute, and immediately add the whites. Beat gently for one minute 
more, and the preparation will be ready. Take a well-cleaned pastry-bag 
(No. 1079), slide into it a No. 2 tube, and with a wooden spoon or small 
skimmer pour the preparation into the bag. When it is all in, close the 
upper part of the bag very firmly, and lay it aside for one moment. Take 
two separate sheets of solid, brown paper, each measuring seventeen 
inches long by five inches wide ; lay them on the table, one beside the 
other. Take hold of the lower part of the bag near the tube with the left 



D ESSEX TS. 355 



hand, and the upper part with the right, press with the latter, and drop 
the batter on the paper in straight strips four inches long by one inch 
wide. Make ten of equal size on each paper, being careful to leave an 
empty space of three quarters of an inch between each. Then with a 
sugar-dredger sprinkle them lightly with powdered sugar three times, at 
one minute's interval between each sprinkling. When finished, lift up 
one paper at a time, keeping it perfectly straight, and shake off the loose 
sugar, being particular that the biscuits do not detach from the paper. 
Now lay them in a pastry baking-pan, and let rest for two minutes ; put 
them into a slow oven, and bake for twenty minutes, until of a light golden 
color. Remove, lift them from the pan, and lay on a table to cool off. 
Have ready a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, then detaching the bis- 
cuits gently from the paper with the hands, dress them neatly or the 
dish, and send to the table. 

1232. Biscuit a la Richelieu. Put half a pound of sugar, half a pound 
of peeled and pounded almonds as for No. 1207, and four egg yolks into 
a bowl, and with a spatula mix well together for two minutes. Place the 
whites of eight eggs in a copper basin, with half a saltspoonful of salt, 
and with a wire whip beat them to a stiff froth ; add this to the above 
preparation, with three ounces of melted butter, three ounces of flour, and 
a teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring. Mix slowly together for three min- 
utes. Butter a plain mold holding three quarts ; line the interior thor- 
oughly, and pour in the preparation ; place it in a moderate oven for an 
hour and a half, then remove, and let it cool, and unmold. Dress on a 
dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve. 

1233. Biscuit a la Livornaise. Prepare the paste exactly as for the 
above (No. 1232), and when ready have a square tin pan, lined all through 
with paper. Spread the paste over an inch thick with a knife, and put it 
in a moderate oven for eighteen minutes. Take it out, and when cool 
lay the cake on a table ; detach the paper, sprinkle the surface freely 
with powdered sugar, and cut it into any shaped pieces desired. Dress 
on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve. 

1234. Petits Biscuits Ambrosiennes. Proceed the same as for biscuits 
a la cuillere (No. 1231). After the paste has been placed in the bag, have 
a well-cleaned pastry baking-pan, well buttered and lightly sprinkled with 
flour. Drop the paste carefully into the pan, forming biscuits, each 
about two inches long, by one inch wide. There should be in all about 
forty biscuits. Place them in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. Re- 
move, and lay them on a table. With a hair-brush spread over them six 
ounces of apricot marmalade (No. 1335), and glaze them with a glace a 
1'eau (No. 1197), flavored with half a gill of white cura9oa. Sprinkle 
over them four ounces of finely chopped pistaches; shake the pan lightly, 
and they will adhere to the glace. Set for two minutes in the oven to get 
dry ; remove, and when cool, dress neatly in a glass bowl, and serve. 

1235. Almond Biscuits. Take two ounces of sweet almonds and half 
an ounce of bitter, peel, and pound them as for No. 1207. Then put them 
in a vessel with eight ounces of powdered sugar. Add the yolks of five 



356 THE TABLE. 



eggs, and beat the preparation thoroughly for five minutes; then 
separately beat the whites to a froth with a pastry wire whip, and mix in 
with the yolks and sugar, adding also one ounce of flour. Stir thoroughly 
with a wooden spatula until perfectly firm, which will require about five 
minutes. It is now ready. Have six paper boxes, any shape desired, 
and fill them with the preparation, using a tablespoon for the purpose. 
Sprinkle the tops with a little finely powdered sugar, arrange them in a 
pastry baking-pan, and put in a slow oven for fifteen minutes ; they must 
get a good golden color. Remove, and when cooled off, dress nicely on a 
dish, and serve. 

1236. ChailSSOn Cakes. Roll half a pound of feuilletage paste (No. 
1076) into a piece eighteen inches long by three wide, and pare off the 
edges lightly. Cut out six square pieces, all the same size, and with a 
pastry-brush moisten the surfaces with beaten egg. Fold up each piece 
by laying one' corner over the other, so they will have a triangular shape. 
Put them on a baking-sheet in the oven for twenty minutes; remove them 
to the oven door ; dredge plenty of powdered sugar over, put them back, 
and close the door for one minute and a half, to allow the sugar to melt 
thoroughly. Remove from the oven, and cool for twenty minutes. The 
cakes will have risen about two inches in front. Then, with the thickest 
part of a larding-needle, make a hollow in front of each cake. Put three 
ounces of currant jelly (No. 1326) into a paper cornet, and with it fill the 
insides of the cakes. Dress them on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, 
and serve. 

1237. Petites Bouche*es des Dames. Put into a pastry-bag (No. 1079) 
half the quantity of biscuits-a-la-cuillere preparation (No. 1231). Butter 
and flour a baking-sheet, and form about fifty small, round biscuits the 
exact shape of macaroons. Sprinkle slightly with powdered sugar, and 
place in a brisk oven to bake for twelve minutes. Remove, and set to 
cool for fifteen minutes. Then lift them from the pan, and lay them up- 
side down on a table. With a knife make a small cavity in the centre of 
each, half an inch in diameter, and fill these with a pastry cream (No. 
1242). Fasten them, two by two, to enclose the cream; they will then be 
ball-shaped. Dip carefully one after the other into a glace preparation 
as for chocolate eclairs (No. 1243). Lay them on a pastry-grate to 
dry for fifteen minutes; then dress on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, 
and send to the table. 

1238. Petites Bouche'es a. la Mrs. Astor. Butter and flour a baking- 
sheet. Put into a pastry-bag (No. 1079) half the quantity of the biscuits- 
-la-cuillere preparation (No. 1231), and drop it on the baking-sheet into 
Lima- bean-shaped pieces, one and a half inches long by half an inch wide. 
Sprinkle them lightly with powdered sugar, and place them in a brisk 
oven to bake for twelve minutes. Take them out and let them cool for 
fifteen minutes, then put them on a table upside down, and in the 
middle of each one cut a hole one inch long by a quarter of an inch wide. 
Fill the holes with apricot marmalade (No. 1335), then unite them, two by 
two, so as to enclose the marmalade and be the perfect shape of Lima 



DESSER TS. 357 



beans. Glaze them neatly by dipping them separately into a glace prep- 
aration as for eclairs a la vanille (No. 1245), and lay them at once on 
a pastry-grate to dry for fifteen minutes. Dress them on a dessert- 
dish with a folded napkin, and serve. The remainder of the paste may 
be used the following day. 

1239. Fancy Almond Cakes. Peel and pound half a pound of 
almonds as for No. 1207; then add two egg whites; when thoroughly 
pounded, put them into a vessel with ten ounces of powdered sugar, and 
the grated rind of a good lemon; then, with the hand, knead well together 
for twenty minutes. Slide a fancy tube (No. 3) into a pastry-bag (No. 
1079), and pour in the above preparation. Cover a baking-sheet with 
brown paper, and holding the top of the bag with the right hand, guide 
the bottom with the left, and press the paste through onto the paper in 
small round bits one inch wide and half an inch high. Make ten of these, 
being careful to keep them one inch apart. Make ten more, shaped like 
the letter S, using the same quantity as for the others; then ten more, 
crescent-shaped, or like the letter C; and with the remainder of the paste 
make ten more, heart-shaped, being careful to keep them from touching 
one another. Take five candied cherries, cut them in halves, and arrange 
them on top of the round cakes; have twenty dried currants (No. 1080), 
and place one on each end of the S. Cut a candied apricot in two, and each 
half into five slices, and lay them on top of the crescents, and lastly have 
one ounce of candied angelica cut into very thin strips, and arrange them 
nicely on the heart-shaped pieces. 

It would be advisable to prepare these cakes the evening before they 
are needed, and lay them aside in a warm place over night. The next 
morning, glaze them lightly with beaten egg, using a pastry-brush, and 
place them in a brisk oven to bake for ten minutes. When of a nice brown 
color, remove, and let them become thoroughly cold. Lift them up care- 
fully with the paper, laying them gently upside down on a table, and 
with a wet towel moisten the paper, so that the cakes will detach easily. 
Turn the paper over immediately as it stood before, let rest for two min- 
utes; then remove the cakes. Lay them on a pastry-grate upside down, 
to allow them to dry for thirty minutes. Dress them on a glass stand 
with a folded napkin, and send to the table. 

1240. Pate-h-Chou. Put into a saucepan two gills of cold milk and 
r.wo ounces of butter. Place it on the range, stir slightly with the spatula, 
and when boiling, immediately add a quarter of a pound of well-sifted flour ; 
stir briskly for two minutes. Then stand the pan on a table. Break in one 
egg; mix sharply for two minutes, break in a second egg, mix sharply again; 
and repeat with a third and a fourth egg; then the pate-a-chou is ready. 

1241. Eclairs. Arrange in a pastry-bag (No. 1079), a tube (No. 3); put 
into it the above quantity of pate-a-chou (No. 1240), and press out upon a 
baking-sheet fifteen eclairs, each one three inches long. Bake them in a 
hot oven for twenty minutes. Remove, and let them cool; then with a 
pair of scissors open each eclair on one side, and with a spoon fill the 
interiors with a creme patissiere (No. 1242). 



358 THE TABLE. 



1242. Creme Patissiere. Put a pint of cold milk into a saucepan, and 
place it on the stove. Mix in another vessel two ounces of powdered 
sugar, with one ounce of flour, and half an ounce of corn-starch. Break 
in two whole eggs, and beat well together with the whip for two minutes. 
When the milk is boiling, add it to the preparation, and after stirring for 
one minute longer, put it into another saucepan, and place it on the stove. 
Beat well until it comes to a boil; then remove from the fire, and add 
immediately a teaspoonful of vanilla essence. Mix thoroughly again for 
one minute longer; then pour it into a bowl, and let it get cold. 

1243. How to Glaze Eclairs with Chocolate. Put in a saucepan one 
pound and three quarters of granulated sugar and a gill of cold water. 
Place on the stove, and with a spatula mix well until Xhe sugar is thor- 
oughly melted, and when boiling remove from the stove, and pour it 
gradually on a marble slab, on which it will spread about three feet 
square. Let it cool off for ten minutes. Then cut two ounces of cocoa 
into small pieces; put them on a plate, and leave them at the oven door to 
melt. With a spatula begin working the sugar that is on the marble as 
rapidly as possible in every direction until it begins to whiten; then add 
the melted cocoa, mixing it thoroughly again until it becomes hard; 
remove the spatula, and detach the preparation quickly from the marble 
with a knife. Put it into a vessel, and covering it with a damp cloth, let 
it rest for thirty minutes. Then place half of it in a saucepan on the hot 
stove, and with the spatula mix thoroughly and slowly until it is luke- 
warm, meanwhile adding a teaspoonful of cold water. Take the 6clairs, 
one by one, and with the hand dip them into this preparation. Lay them 
on a pastry - grate ; let them cool off for five minutes ; dress on a 
dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve. 

Keep the rest of the preparation for further use. When laid aside in 
a cool place, and properly taken care of, it will be as good in two weeks' 
time as when freshly made. 

1244. Eclairs au Cafe. Have a pate-a-chou ready, as for No. 1240; 
then proceed to make the eclairs. Bake, and fill them with a creme patis- 
siere (No. 1242) exactly as for the chocolate eclairs; glazing them the same 
as for No. 1243, only instead of cocoa use half a gill of coffee essence 
(No. 1263). Serve precisely the same. 

1245. Eclairs a la Yanille. Prepare a pate-a-chou as for No. 1240. 
Make the eclairs, bake, and fill them with a creme patissiere, as No. 1242. 
Glaze them as for No. 1243, only substituting two teaspoonfuls of vanilla 
essence for the cocoa, and serving them the same. 

1246. ChoilX a la Creme. Prepare a pate-a-chou as for No. 1240, and 
put it into the bag. Press it down onto a baking-sheet into six round, equal 
cakes, about two inches high. Glaze the surface of each with beaten egg. 
Bake in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. Watch them carefully, and 
when they are of a good golden color, remove from the oven and let cool 
for half an hour. Make an incision on one side, about half-way in the 
cakes, using a pair of scissors. Fill the insides with creme patissiere 
(No. 1242), and close them again. Dredge well with powdered sugar, 



DESSERTS. 359 



and dress on a dessert-dish, with a folded napkin, before sending to the 
table. 

1247. Meringues. Put six egg whites into a copper basin, with a 
light half saltspoonful of salt, and with a wire whip begin beating slowly, 
but gradually increase until a stiff froth is obtained. Should it become 
grainy, beat briskly again, adding half an ounce of powdered sugar. 
(Eight minutes should suffice to have a proper froth.) Remove the whip. 
Have on a plate one pound of powdered sugar, and with a spatula drop 
the sugar slowly and carefully over the froth, mixing, it in meanwhile 
with the spatula. This should take about two minutes. Flavor it with 
any desired flavoring, and it will be ready for use. 

1248. Apples^ Meringuees. Have six fine apples cooked as for No. 
1169; dress them on a dessert-dish, filling the cavities with currant jelly 
(No. 1326); then decorate all round and the tops with meringue, prepared 
as for No. 1247, half the quantity being sufficient. Sprinkle them moder- 
ately with powdered sugar; lay the dish on a baking-pan, and put it in the 
oven for five minutes. When a light brown color, remove, and serve 
either hot or cold. 

1249. Small Fancy Meringues a la Ch. C. Delmonico. Put into a 
sugar-pan one pound of granulated sugar with half a pint of cold water, 
and place on the hot stove. Have two quarts of ice-water in a vessel, 
and when the sugar comes to a boil, dip the fingers of the right hand into 
the ice-water and pass them quickly around the inside of the pan, and let 
boil for five minutes. Dip a wooden stick, similar to a pen-holder, in the 
ice-water, then quickly into the boiling sugar, and again in the ice-water, 
lifting up the stick to feel the sugar that adheres. Should it not be suffi- 
ciently consistent to form into a ball, let boil a little longer; then try once 
more; and should it be a proper thickness, remove from the fire and set 
it on the corner of the stove, so that it no longer boils. While the sugar 
is cooking, beat the whites of five eggs in a copper basin until they are a 
firm froth; and while beating, have an assistant pour very gradually the 
prepared sugar into the egg-froth; and when all is added, lay the* basin 
containing the preparation into a vessel half filled with ice- water. Remove 
the whip, and using a wooden spatula, mix gently for five minutes, add- 
ing a teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring. Cover the basin with a napkin, 
letting it rest for ten minutes. Butter and flour a baking-sheet; slide 
down a fancy tube (No. 3) into a pastry-bag (No. 1079), fill it with the 
preparation, press down onto the baking-sheet, giving a C-shape, two 
inches long by one wide, to forty of them; and then forming twenty more, 
shaped like the letter D. Sprinkle them lightly with powdered sugar; 
place in a very slow oven, and let bake for fifteen minutes. When baked, 
these cakes should be perfectly white. Remove them from the oven, let 
get thoroughly cold; dress on a glass stand, and send to the table. 

1250. Meringue-shells. Prepare a meringue as for No. 1247. Slide a 
tube (No. 4) down a pastry-bag (No. 1079); lay a piece of paper over a bak- 
ing-sheet, and after putting the meringue into the bag, press it out onto 
the paper, giving it an egg-shape, two and a half inches long by one inch 



360 THE TABLE. 



high. There will be enough to make eighteen equal-sized shells. Be 
careful to keep them one inch apart. Sprinkle over liberally with pow- 
dered sugar, and place in a very slow oven to bake thirty minutes. Re- 
move, and set to cool for twenty-five minutes. Then turn the paper con., 
taining the shells upside down on the table; and with a wet cloth or 
brush moisten well the paper; turn them over again, and let rest for two 
minutes, when the shells will detach easily. With the finger press them 
gently, one by one, in the bottom, into a perfect shell-shape. Return 
them to the baking-sheet, laying them upside down, and put them in the 
oven to dry thoroughly for ten minutes; then leave them to cool for thirty 
minutes more. Keep them in a dry place, either in a tin or paper box, 
and use when required. Meringue-shells prepared this way will keep 
nicely for at least twenty-five days. 

1251. Swiss Meringues k PHelve"tieime. Have a meringue prepara- 
tion as for No. 1247; slide down in a pastry-bag (No. 1079) a tube (No. 4). 
Butter and flour a baking-sheet ; make on it one design eight inches in 
diameter ; another exactly the same shape, only six inches, and another of 
the same, only four inches. Put the meringue into the bag, and press it 
down gently over and around the first design, making the paste three- 
quarters of an inch thick ; repeat the same for the second and third forms. 
Press down in the pan some more meringue, making a little cone four 
inches high, two inches in diameter at the base, and tapering gradually to 
a point at the top. Sprinkle the whole lightly with powdered sugar, and 
place the pan in a very moderate oven to bake for twenty-five minutes. 
Take it out, and let it thoroughly cool for half an hour. Have a quart of 
whipped creme & la vanille (No. 1254), add to it half a gill of Swiss kirsch 
and half a gill of maraschino, and with a pastry-whip beat the whole 
together for three minutes. Have ready a round dessert-dish with a 
fancy paper over, detach carefully the largest form from the pan, lay it 
on the dish, detach the second, lay it over the first, and fill the hollow 
space with half of the cream ; now detach the third and smallest piece and 
lay it over the others, filling it entirely with part of the cream, and finally 
detach the cover, and arrange it nicely on the top. Pour the remaining 
cream into the pastry-bag containing the fancy tube, and with it decorate 
the places where the rings are joined. Then send to the table. 

1252. Creme Benversee. Put in a copper sugar-pan three ounces of 
granulated sugar with half a gill of cold water. Toss the pan briskly to 
melt the sugar well; then place it on the stove, and let it boil slowly until it 
becomes a light brown color. If a moderate fire, it will require four min- 
utes, but if a brisk one only two will suffice ; this will now be a caramel. 
Take a pudding-mold holding one quart ; line the interior with all the 
caramel, holding the mold in the left hand, and spreading it evenly all 
round. Put the mold in a cool place, and let it become thoroughly cold. 
Have one pint of milk in a bowl ; break in four eggs, add a quarter of a 
pound of powdered sugar and a teaspoonful of lemon essence. Beat well 
for five minutes ; strain through a sieve into another bowl, and fill the 
mold with this cream. Place it in a tin pan filled with water to half the 



361 



height of the mold, and place in a very moderate oven for forty-five min- 
utes. When of a good golden color remove, and cool for at least two 
hours. Turn it on a dessert-dish, and serve with its own juice. 

1253. Creine en Mousse au Cafe. Take a pint of whipped cream as 
for No. 1254, add three tablespoonfuls of coffee essence (No. 1263), and 
beat well together for five minutes. Transfer it to a china bowl, and put 
it in a cold ice-box. When ready to serve, use a spoon to drop the cream 
carefully upon the centre of a cold, round dessert-dish, keeping it as high 
as possible, shaping it into a pretty, artistic dome. Send immediately to 
the table. 

1254. "Whipped Cream & la Yanille. Put a pint of sweet cream into a 
basin. Have a tub or large dish-pan containing chopped ice and a little 
\vater, and lay the basin on top. With a soft wire egg-whip beat the 
cream slowly at first, and increase in swiftness until it is a firm froth. 
Sweeten with two ounces of powdered sugar, and add a teaspoonful of 
vanilla flavoring, beating constantly. Let it rest, and use when needed. 
Remove all the superfluous milk which may be found with the cream, 
before using it. 

1255. Creme en Mousse au Rhuiu. With a pint of fresh, sweet cream 
proceed as for No. 1254, adding a gill of rum, and beating well together 
for five minutes. Transfer it into a china bowl, and place in the ice-box 
until ready to use. When serving, have a cold dessert-dish, and with a 
wooden spoon drop the cream carefully into the centre of the dish, keep- 
ing it piled high as possible so to give it a pretty dome form, and send to 
the table immediately. 

1256. Creme en Mousse an Kirsch. Proceed as for No. 1255, only 
substituting a gill of kirsch for the gill of rum ; serve in the same 
manner. 

1257. Creme en Mousse au Maraschino. Prepared the same as creme 
en mousse au rhum (No. 1255), substituting a gill of maraschino for the 
rum. 

1258. Creme en Mousse au Cognac. The same as for No. 1255, add- 
ing a gill of cognac instead of the rum, but serving the same way. 

1250. Creme en Mousse au Cura^oa. Substituting a gill of cura9oa 
for a gill of rum, and proceeding precisely the same as for No. 1255. 

1260. Creme en Mousse. To be prepared exactly the same, Only 
using a gill of any other liquor desired, and serving the same as No. 1255. 

1261. Charlotte Russe a la Creme. Take six small, round charlotte 
russe molds two and a half inches high, three inches in diameter at the 
top by two at the bottom. When thoroughly cleaned, line them with 
biscuits a la cuillere (No. 1231), cut them in two, and should they be 
higher than the mold, trim them off to the edge. Pour the whipped cream 
(No. 1254) into a pastry-bag (No. 1079), and fill up the molds. Turn them 
over onto six dessert-plates, spread a little more cream on the top of each, 
and cover them each with one macaroon (No. 1210). Dress the rest of 
the cream nicely around the plates, and serve. 

1262. Charlotte Russe au Cafe. Line and prepare six small charlotte- 



362 THE TABLE. 



molds as for the above (No. 1261), adding to the whipped cream two table- 
spoonfuls of coffee essence (No. 1263). Beat thoroughly together for two 
minutes, then fill the molds, and serve as for the above. 

1263. Coffee Essence. Take one ounce of good, ground coffee; place 
it in a small saucepan with half a pint of cold water, and let boil until 
reduced to about two tablespoonfuls. Then strain through a cloth, press- 
ing it well, and let cool thoroughly. Add it to the cream as described in 
No. 1262. 

1264. How to Cook Sugar. Put into a sugar -pan one pound of 
granulated sugar, with half a pint of cold water; place it on a brisk stove. 
Have a vessel containing two quarts of ice-water, and when the sugar 
comes to a boil dip the fingers of the right hand into the water, and quickly 
pass them all around the inside of the pan, being careful to avoid touching 
the sugar; repeat this two or three times. However difficult this opera- 
tion may appear, it is essential that it should be done, in order to have 
the sugar in a perfect condition. Take care to dip the fingers into the ice- 
water each time. Let the sugar boil; then squeeze in three drops of 
lemon juice. To know when it is sufficiently boiled, have a thin piece of 
wood the shape of a larding-needle. Dip the point into the ice-water, and 
then plunge it into the boiling sugar; remove it quickly, and dip it imme- 
diately into the water again. Lift it out, and see whether the sugar adher- 
ing to the wood be thoroughly hard. If not, let boil again, and continue 
to test with the stick as before. To be certain that the sugar is perfectly 
done, place the point of the stick between the teeth, and bite it. Should 
the sugar stick to the teeth, it needs more boiling, but if it cracks easily 
without sticking, it is thoroughly done. Rem.ove it immediately from the 
fire, and place the bottom of the pan in the ice-water to prevent the sugar 
from turning brown. 

The above cooked sugar can be used for glazing dried fruits and candied 
fruits of all kinds; also to fasten on pieces of of nougat, and to make any 
kind of caramels, etc., etc. 

1265. Burned Sugar. Put into a small iron omelet-pan half a pound 
of granulated sugar, and place on a slow stove, to burn thoroughly for 
thirty minutes. Remove the pan to the table to cool slightly for five 
minutes, and then add half a pint of boiling water, mixing well with an 
iron spoon. Replace the pan on the stove, and boil for five minutes, stir- 
ring continually ; then strain the sugar through a sieve into a vessel, and 
put in a cold place to cool thoroughly. Pour it into a bottle, and use 
when required. Burned sugar prepared this way will keep in perfect 
condition for several weeks. 

1266. Nougat. Have ready four ounces of peeled and dried almond 
(No. 1207). Cut each into four slices, and lay them in a tin pan with a 
sheet of paper under them. Put the pan in a warm place, but not on the 
stove. Take a copper sugar-pan, or dropper, put into it six ounces of 
powdered sugar, and place it on a hot stove ; then with a dry, wooden 
spatula stir continually, until the sugar is dissolved, being careful to avoid 
browning it, Remove from the fire, add one drop of lemon juice, and let 



363 



it cool aff slightly for three minutes, stirring constantly ; then add the 
almonds, mixing all gently with the spatula for two minutes. The nougat 
is now ready for use, and can be molded into cornets-d'abondance, columns, 
bases, or any shape the fancy may dictate. 

1267. Small Pyramid of Nougat. Oil slightly the interior of a 
small, round base. Take half the nougat, prepared as for No. 1266, 
lay it on a marble table (the nougat should always be hot), roll it out very 
thin with an oiled roller, and with this line the oiled base. Then with a 
whole lemon sharply press the nougat onto the mold to give it a perfect 
form, cutting it evenly away all around the edge. Put the pieces with 
the rest in the pan, and place near the fire to keep hot. Have a small 
cornet-d'abondance (cornucopia), oil it slightly, and line the inside with half 
the remaining nougat, rolled out as before, and pressing it the same. Cut 
away all the superfluous part, and let it cool slightly. Then unmold both 
the base and cornet. Oil a tartlet-mold, and line it with the rest of the 
nougat. Lay the base carefully upon a glass stand of suitable size, the 
covered part uppermost, and fasten to the stand with cooked sugar (No. 
1264). With cooked sugar fasten the cornet in the middle, small end 
uppermost, using cooked sugar for the purpose. Put the remaining 
piece from the tartlet-mold on top of all, and fasten it in the same way. 
All this should be done carefully and patiently. Have ready two well- 
peeled, sound oranges, pull them gently to pieces, looking closely at each 
separate section to see that the skin is not broken or loosened. Have a 
quarter of a pound of fresh Malaga grapes, detach them, leaving on each 
grape about a quarter of an inch of stem. Take also two ounces of candied 
cherries, plunge the grapes into the cooked sugar (No. 1264), and with a 
fork lift them up, and immediately lay them on a well-cleaned, oiled, 
marble table. Treat the pieces of orange and the cherries each the same 
way. During this time, should the sugar become cool, heat it up once 
more ; fill the cornet with these fruits, dipping one side of each piece into 
the cooked sugar to make them adhere together. With a part of them fill 
the tart-shaped piece on top, proceeding in the same manner, and decorate 
with glace royale (No. 1269). 

1269. Grlace Royale. Put the white of one egg into a small bowl. 
Beat it well with a small spatula, adding six ounces of extra fine sugar, 
and squeezing in three drops of lemon juice. Then continue beating for 
twenty minutes. When finished, it should be snow-white and pulpy. 
Make a small brown paper cornet, cut off the lower end, slide down a 
small fancy tube, and pour in some of the glace royale, covering the 
remainder of it with a damp cloth. Then with the cornet decorate the 
edge of the nougat base as in the preceding (No. 1268), also the upper 
edge, and all around the edge of the cornet, and finish by decorating 
artistically the tart-shaped piece on top; then send it to the table. 

All nougat pieces, when finished, should be kept in a moderate 
temperature. 

1270. Blanc-manger k la Josephine Delmonico. Peel neatly six 
ounces of sweet almonds and two ounces of bitter almonds (No. 1207).

Put in a vessel, cover with cold water, and let them soak for fully one 
hour. Drain thoroughly through a sieve, and pound them well in a 
mortar, adding, little by little, a gill of cold water, and continue pounding 
for ten minutes. Now remove to a vessel and add two gills of lukewarm 
water, and mix together with the spatula for two minutes. Spread a 
large napkin over another vessel, pour on the above preparation, lift up 
the four corners, and holding it with the left hand, squeeze the liquid 
through with the right. Lay this almond milk aside for further use. Put 
into a saucepan two gills of cold water, half an ounce of gelatine, a piece 
of vanilla-bean two inches long and split in two, and four ounces of 
powdered sugar. Mix well with the spatula for two minutes; remove the 
spatula, put on the lid, and let infuse for thirty minutes. Then place the 
saucepan on the hot stove, and stir gently from the bottom, allowing it to 
boil slowly for four minutes. Remove it from the fire, and let the pan 
rest on the table for three minutes. Pour in the almond milk, mix again 
for two minutes, using the spatula, and strain the whole through a fine 
sieve into another vessel. Have a three-pint, channeled blanc-manger 
mold; put some broken ice at the bottom of a pail, place the mold on it, 
arranging more broken ice around the sides, so that the mold be entirely 
sunk in the ice as far up as the edge. Stir the preparation for one minute, 
then pour it into the mold, cover the pail with a napkin, and leave it to 
congeal for one hour. Take up the mold carefully from the pail, wipe off 
the ice with a towel, and have ready a cold dessert-dish with a folded nap- 
kin over. Turn out the blanc-manger onto this; decorate the surface with 
two ounces of candied cherries and one ounce of angelica, and it is ready 
for the table. 

1271. Vanilla Ice-cream. Boil in a saucepan one pint of milk with 
half a vanilla-bean; put in a vessel half a pound of powdered sugar, and 
six egg yolks, and with a spatula mix thoroughly for ten minutes; then 
add it to the boiling milk, stirring for two minutes longer, and pour the 
whole into a copper basin, placing it on a moderate stove to heat for five 
minutes, stirring at the bottom continually with the spatula, and being 
careful not to let it boil. Remove from off the fire, place it on a table, and 
add immediately one pint of sweet cream, still mixing it for two minutes 
more; let cool off for thirty minutes, then strain through a sieve into an 
ice-cream freezer; put on the lid, and lay it in an ice-cream tub, filling the 
freezer all round with broken ice, mixed slightly with rock-salt; then turn 
the handle on the cover as briskly as possible for three minutes. Lift up 
the lid, and with a wooden spoon detach the cream from all around the 
freezer, and the bottom as well. Re-cover it, and turn the handle sharply 
for three minutes more; uncover, and detach the cream the'same as before, 
being careful that no ice or salt drops in. Put the lid on, and repeat the 
same three times more. The ice-cream should by this time be quite firm, 
so have a cold dessert-dish with a folded napkin, dress the ice-cream over, 
and send to the table. 

This same ice-cream can be formed into a single brick by having a 
brick-shaped form, filling it with the cream, and pressing it down quickly 



DESSERTS. 365 



with a spoon; cover closely, being careful that the form is completely 
filled, so that no salted water can penetrate into it. Put broken ice at the 
bottom of a pail, mixing in a little rock-salt, lay the form on top, covering 
it entirely with broken ice and salt; let freeze for one hour, remove, and 
bathe it in a vessel containing lukewarm water; wash off the ice and salt 
that adhere, and lift it out as quickly as possible; remove the cover, and 
turn it on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, lift up the mold, and send 
the ice-cream to the table. 

1272. Chocolate Ice-cream. Prepare and cook exactly the same as 
for vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271); put in a saucepan two ounces of well- 
chopped cocoa and an ounce of powdered sugar, add to it half the cream 
preparation ; place the pan on the stove, and with a pastry-whip stir 
briskly, and let boil for three minutes ; take it from the fire, add it to the 
remaining half of cream, then mix the whole well together for two min- 
utes. Strain through a fine sieve into an ice-cream freezer, let cool for 
thirty minutes, then proceed to freeze it exactly the same as for the 
vanilla ice-cream, and serve it also the same. 

1273. Coffee Ice-cream. Put in a vessel half a pound of powdered 
sugar and six egg yolks ; mix well with the spatula for ten minutes, then 
add one pint of boiling milk, stir for two minutes longer, and pour the 
whole into a copper basin; place it on the hot stove, and with the spatula 
stir gently at the bottom until well heated, but it must not boil. Take 
from off the fire, set it on a table, then immediately add a pint of sweet 
cream, mixing again for two minutes, and throw in two ounces of freshly 
ground Mocha coffee, stirring for two minutes longer ; return the basin 
to the stove, beat it up again with the pastry-whip, and lay it on the table 
once more. Cover with a napkin, so that the coffee can infuse thoroughly 
for- half an hour, then strain through a fine sieve into the freezer, and 
proceed freezing, and serving exactly the same as for vanilla ice-cream 
(No. 1271). 

1274. Strawberry Ice-cream. Prepare and proceed exactly the same 
as for the coffee ice-cream (No. 1273), suppressing the coffee, and when 
the cream is cooked and cool, add half a pint of well picked and cleaned 
strawberries. Mix well with the spatula for two minutes, then strain 
through a fine sieve into the freezer, pressing the strawberries through 
with a wooden spoon ; remove the sieve, cover the freezer, and proceed 
to freeze, and serve precisely the same as for vanilla ice-cream (No. 
1271). 

1275. Pistache Ice-cream. Have two ounces of fine, dried pistaches, 
using only the best quality ; put them into a pie-plate, place it in the 
oven to let the nuts get a light brown color, which will take about six 
minutes ; remove from the oven, lay the pistaches in a mortar with one 
ounce of granulated sugar, and pound slightly. Have a cream prepara- 
tion exactly the same as for coffee ice-cream (No. 1273), suppressing the 
coffee. When cooked, add the pint of sweet cream and the pistache, then 
place it on the stove and heat well, stirring continually. Remove from 
the fire, cover the basin with a napkin, and let get thoroughly cool for

thirty minutes. Add three drops of orange-flower water and five drops 
of spinach-green, mix the whole well for two minutes, then strain through 
a fine sieve into the freezer, and proceed to freeze and serve exactly the 
same as for vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271). 

1276. Peach Ice-cream. Put in a vessel half a pound of powdered 
sugar with six egg yolks, then mix well with the spatula for ten minutes ; 
add a pint of boiling milk, stir for two minutes longer, and pour the whole 
into a copper basin. Place it on a hot stove, and heat it thoroughly, stir- 
ring continually, but not letting it boil ; remove, lay it on the table, and 
mix in immediately one pint of sweet cream; then leave it to cool for 
thirty minutes. Have six ripe, fine, sound peaches, wipe them nicely > 
cut them in two, remove the stones, then mash them into the cream, mix- 
ing thoroughly for three minutes ; strain through a fine sieve into a 
freezer, pressing the peaches through with a wooden spoon, then proceed 
to freeze, and serve precisely the same as for the vanilla ice-cream (No. 
1271). 

1277. Banana Ice-cream. Prepare and proceed exactly the same as 
for the peach ice-cream (No. 1276), using four peeled, sound, and ripe 
bananas instead of the peaches, and finishing exactly the same as for the 
other. 

1278. Lemon Ice-cream. Put half a pound of powdered sugar into 
a basin ; grate in the rind of two fine lemons, add four egg whites, and 
mix well with a wire whip for two minutes, then add a pint of cold milk, 
stirring again for one minute. Place the basin on the hot stove, stir 
briskly with the whip, and take it off when coming to a boil, lay it on the 
table, and pour in a pint of sweet cream, mixing well for two minutes. 
Let it get cool during half an hour, then strain through a fine sieve into a 
freezer, and finish precisely the same as for vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271). 

1279. Lemon Water-ice. Put in a vessel half a pound of powdered 
sugar, with one quart of cold water ; grate in the rind of a large lemon, 
or of two small ones, squeezing in the juice of three good-sized ones, or 
of four if small, and with the spatula beat well together for five minutes. 
Have a syrup-weigher, place it in the centre of the preparation, and if it 
be twenty-one degrees it is correct, if not, add a little more powdered 
sugar ; remove the weigher, mix a little more, and then strain through a 
sieve into the freezer, putting on the cover, and proceed to freeze it pre- 
cisely the same as for vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271), serving it the same. 

1280. Orange Water-ice. Put into a vessel one quart of cold water, 
half a pound of powdered sugar, and grate in the rind of two fine, ripe, 
medium-sized, red oranges, adding their juice besides, the juice of three 
medium-sized, sound lemons, then finish the same as for lemon water-ice 
(No. 1279). 

1281. Raspberry Water-ice. Place in a vessel half a pound of pow- 
dered sugar, squeeze in the juice of three sound lemons, add a pint of

and proceed to finish and serve the same as for lemon water-ice (No. 1279). 



DESSERTS. 367 

1282. Cherry Water-ice. Procure one pound of sound, solid, sour 
cherries ; put them in a vessel, after picking off the stems nicely, with 
half a pound of powdered sugar, and squeeze in the juice of three fine 
lemons. Mix well with the spatula for five minutes, then add a quart of 
cold water, stirring the mixture for two minutes longer, and strain through 
a fine sieve into the ice-cream freezer, pressing the cherries down with a 
wooden spoon. Proceed to freeze, and serve exactly the same as for the 
vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271). 

1283. Pineapple Water-ice. Cut a small-sized, ripe pineapple in 
two ; put one half away for further use, paring and peeling the other 
half neatly, then cut it into small pieces ; place them in a mortar, and 
pound them thoroughly to a pulp; ten minutes will suffice for this. Add 
half a pound of powdered sugar, and pound again for five minutes ; trans- 
fer the whole into a vessel, squeeze in the juice of three sound lemons, 
then pour in a quart of cold water, and mix well with the spatula for two 
minutes. Strain through a fine sieve into the freezer, adding two egg 
whites, beaten to a stiff froth, then beat well for one minute more. Cover 
with the lid, and finish it the same as the vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271). 

1284. Peach Water-ice. Procure eight medium -sized, fine, ripe 
peaches ; wipe them neatly, cut in two, remove the stones, then mash 
them in a vessel with half a pound of powdered sugar ; squeeze in the 
juice of three fine lemons, mix well with the spatula for two minutes, and 
pour in a quart of cold water, mixing for two minutes more. Strain 
through a fine sieve into the freezer, cover, and proceed to freeze the 
cream as for vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271), serving it the same. 

1285. Apricot Water-ice. Have twelve good-sized, fine, sound apri- 
cots; wipe them neatly, cut them in two, remove the stones, and put 
them in a vessel with half a pound of powdered sugar, mashing them 
thoroughly. Have two ounces of bitter almonds, peel, and pound with- 
out drying 'them ; add one gill of cold water and one ounce of pow- 
dered sugar, pounding the whole together. Arrange a napkin over 
the vessel containing the apricot preparation; pour over it the contents 
of the mortar, pressing the juice through the napkin into the vessel, and 
mix well together for two minutes with the spatula. Squeeze in the juice 
of three sound lemons; add a pint and a half of cold water, mix again for 
two minutes, then strain through a fine sieve into the freezer. Put on 
the cover, and proceed to finish exactly the same as for the vanilla ice- 
cream (No. 1271). 

1286. Biscuits GlaceS. Put six egg yolks in a copper basin, with two 
ounces of powdered sugar, half a gill of maraschino, and a quarter of a 
gill of Swiss kirsch. Then with a pastry-whip beat well together for two 
minutes. Place the basin on a hot stove, and stir briskly with the whip 
for five minutes. Remove it from the fire, and immediately put the 
basin into a vessel containing ice-water, and stir continually for two min- 
utes more. Add a pint and a half of whipped cream a la vanille (No. 1254), 
and mix well with the rest for three minutes. Then cover the basin with 
a napkin, and let repose for ten minutes. Have six paper cases, four

inches long, two inches wide, and one and a half inches high, and fill 
equally with the above preparation. Have ready a square biscuit-glace 
box, ten inches high by six inches square, and having inside a loose, two- 
tier frame. Place this box in an ice-cream tub, filling it with broken ice 
mixed with rock-salt. Wipe the cover neatly, and after lifting it up, 
remove the frame and place three biscuits on each tier; return the frame 
to the box, put the cover on, and let freeze for one and a half hours. Have 
a cold dessert-dish covered with a folded napkin; uncover the box, lift up 
the frame, and dress the biscuits nicely on the dish, sending them to the 
table at once. 

1287. Biscuits Tortoili. Prepare and proceed exactly the same as for 
biscuits glaces (No. 1286), only placing the preparation into six round, 
fancy paper cases, instead of square ones. When filled, sift evenly over 
the surfaces two ounces of finely powdered macaroons (No. 1210); lay 
them on the tiers of the frame, and freeze them, serving them precisely 
as the biscuits glaces. 

1288. Iced Pudding a la Diplomatc. Have a biscuit-glac prepara- 
tion exactly the same as for No. 1286; cut ten biscuits a la cuillere (No. 
1231) into dice-shaped pieces, and add them to the preparation. Then, 
with a wooden spoon, mix lightly for two minutes. With this fill a three- 
pint, melon-shaped form, and place the cover on. Have a pail, with broken 
ice in the bottom; lay the form on it, and fill the pail with more broken ice 
and rock-salt, and let it freeze thoroughly for two hours. Have ready a 
vessel with warm water; take out the mold from the pail, plunge it into the 
warm water, to wash away the ice and salt; then remove it immediately, 
unmold it onto a dessert-dish with a fancy paper, and serve. 

1289. Plum Pudding Glac a la Gladstone. Have ready three ounces 
of Malaga raisins, prepared as for No. 1081; place them in a stone jar 
with half a pint of good old sherry, adding three ounces of candied cher- 
ries cut into quarters, one ounce of finely chopped candied citron, and 
two ounces of candied apricots, also cut into small pieces; then with the 
spatula mix gently together for one and a half minutes. Cover the jar, 
and let infuse for fully twelve hours. Prepare a chocolate ice-cream, as 
for No. 1272, and just before removing it from the freezer add the above 
fruit preparation, mixing well with the spatula for fully two minutes. Put 
on the cover, and let freeze again for five minutes longer. Take a three- 
pint melon-form, and with a spoon fill it with the pudding preparation; 
cover it well, and put it in a pail containing broken ice and rock-salt at 
the bottom; then fill up the pail with more ice and salt, allowing it to 
freeze for fully two hours. In the meanwhile prepare the following sauce: 
put in a saucepan two egg yolks with one ounce of powdered sugar; 
place it on a slow stove, and with a pastry-whip stir briskly, adding grad- 
ually one gill of old English brandy. Heat it well, but it must not boil. 
Then take from the fire, set the pan on a table, and continue stirring for 
twelve minutes. Add a pint of well-whipped creme a la vanille (No. 1254), 
mixing the whole well together with the whip for two minutes, and pour 
the sauce into a china bowl, placing it in the ice-box. Have a vessel 



DESSERTS. 369 



ready containing warm water; lift the mold from the pail, plunge it into 
the water to remove the ice and salt adhering; then lift it up, unmold the 
pudding immediately, and place it on a dessert-dish, with a fancy paper 
cover. Beat well the sauce; transfer it to a silver sauce-bowl, and send 
it to the table with the plum pudding, serving it separately. 

1290. Macaroon Ice-cream. Take six ounces of macaroons (No. 1210); 
put them into a tin pan, and place it in a moderate oven to dry for ten 
minutes. Remove, and lay them on a table to cool off for twenty min- 
utes, then put them in a mortar, pound thoroughly, and sift them over a 
sheet of paper. Have ready a vanilla ice-cream as for No. 1271, and just 
before serving add to it the sifted macaroons, and with the spatula mix 
thoroughly for five minutes, and with this fill a three-pint brick-mold, 
covering it tightly. Have ready a pail with broken ice and rock-salt at 
the bottom, lay the mold over, and fill up the pail with more ice and salt. 
Let it freeze for two hours, and when ready to serve, have ready a vessel 
with warm water, take up the mold, bathe it in the water, and wash off 
all the salt and ice that adhere, then unmold the ice-cream onto a dessert- 
dish with a fancy paper over, and send to the table immediately. 

1291. Pudding Glace a la Frankie Cleveland. Prepare half the quan- 
tity of vanilla ice-cream as for No. 1271; when frozen, let it rest, and pre- 
pare also half the quantity of biscuit-glace preparation (No. 1286), and 
when ready cover the basin, and let rest also. Have half a pound of 
marrons glaces (candied chestnuts); break them into pieces onto a plate ; 
take a three-pint melon-form, arrange the vanilla ice-cream all around it, 
dividing it evenly, and filling up with alternate layers of the biscuit prep- 
aration and the marrons glaces ; cover the mold tightly, and place it in a 
pail with broken ice mixed with rock-salt at the bottom, also filling the 
pail with more ice and salt, then let freeze for fully two hours. Two 
minutes before serving, bathe the mold in warm water to remove the ice 
and salt that adhere, unmold, and send to the table immediately with a 
sauce-bowl full of the following sauce : add to half a pint of whipped 
cream a la vanille (No. 1254) one gill of strawberry juice, and half a gill, 
or two ounces, of yellow chartreuse ; beat well together with the whip 
for two minutes, then pour it into the sauce-bowl. 

1292. Napolitaine Ice-cream. Prepare a pint of vanilla ice-cream as 
for No. 1271; a pint of pistache ice-cream (No. 1275), and a pint of rasp- 
berry water-ice (No. 1281). Take a long brick-form holding three pints, 
put at the bottom of this the raspberry water-ice, arrange the vanilla ice- 
cream on top, and fill up with the pistache, then cover tightly. Take a 
pail with broken ice mixed with rock-salt at the bottom, lay the form 
over, and fill up the pail with more ice and salt, and let freeze for two 
hours. Plunge the form in warm water to wash off the ice and salt, and 
unmold the ice-cream onto a piece of paper laid on the table. Dip a long 
knife in warm water, cut the brick lengthwise through the centre, then 
each piece into three, so that the Napolitaine will be divided into six 
equal-sized square pieces, each one having the three kinds of cream. 
Dress on a cold dessert-dish with a fancy paper over, and serve,

37O THE TABLE. 



1293. Tutti-frutti. Prepare a pint of vanilla ice-cream as for No. 
1271, half a pint of strawberry ice-cream (No. 1274), and half a pint of 
lemon water-ice (No. 1279); let them remain in the freezers. Put four 
ounces of candied cherries onto a plate, cut them in halves, and add two 
candied apricots cut into small pieces. Take six tutti-frutti molds, open 
one of them, and lay on the cover a spoonful of strawberry ice-cream, 
with a spoonful of the lemon water-ice, one beside the other, press the 
sixth part of the candied fruits onto the ice-cream in the cover of the 
mold, filling the bottom with vanilla ice-cream, and close together firmly. 
Lay it immediately into a pail with broken ice and rock-salt at the bottom, 
cover the mold slightly with more ice and salt, then proceed to prepare 
the other five molds exactly the same. When they are all in the pail and 
covered as the first one, fill it up entirely with broken ice and salt, and let 
it freeze for one hour. Have a vessel containing warm water ready at 
hand, and prepare six small dessert-plates with a small fancy paper on 
each, lift up the molds, one after the other, wash them off quickly with 
the warm water, and unmold the tutti-fruttis onto the cold plates, and 
serve. 

1294. Plombiere a la King-man. Put together into a saucepan eight 
egg yolks, half a pound of powdered sugar, a piece of vanilla-bean one 
inch long and split in two, also a pint of sweet cream, and six ounces of 
finely grated cocoa. Mix well with the spatula for two minutes, then 
place the pan on the hot stove, and stir constantly while heating, but 
under no circumstances must it boil. Remove it from the fire, and lay 
the pan in a cool place on the table for thirty minutes. Put an ice-cream 
freezer into a tub, fill it all round with broken ice mixed with rock-salt, 
remove the cover, and after wiping the freezer well, strain the prepara- 
tion through a sieve into it, cover it again, and with the hands turn the 
handle of the cover for five minutes in opposite directions. Lift up the 
cover, and with the spatula detach the preparation that adheres to the 
sides, readjust the cover, and turn again the handle, beginning in an 
opposite direction from the first time ; after five minutes, detach from the 
sides as before, and repeat for the third time the turning process. Finally 
lift off the cover, and detach the cream from all around, and it will now 
be thoroughly firm, so cover it again, and let it rest. Beat up to a froth 
one gill of sweet cream as for No. 1254 ; take a glass or silver stand, and 
with an ice-cream spoon remove the cream from the freezer, spoonful by 
spoonful, and dress it in the centre of the bowl, keeping it as high as pos- 
sible, and giving it a pretty, pyramid shape. Fill a paper cornet with the 
whipped cream, cut off the point, and decorate artistically the top and 
sides of the plombiere. Chop up very fine two ounces of pistache, and 
sprinkle them evenly over the surface, then send to the table. 

1295. Parfait an Cafe a la Parisienne. Place sixounces of powdered 
sugar in a saucepan with six egg yolks and a pint of sweet cream, and 
mix well together for two minutes ; set the saucepan on the hot stove, 
then stir gently and continually from the bottom, using a spatula, until 
nearly coming to a boil ; as this is difficult to determine on account of the 



D ESSEX rs. 371 



briskness of the fire, the best way to tell when it is sufficiently done is to 
lift up the spatula and see whether the cream adheres thickly to it, if so, 
remove the saucepan from the fire and lay it on the table, add immedi- 
ately to it four ounces of freshly roasted Mocha coffee in beans, then stir 
again well for one minute more. Remove the spatula, cover the sauce- 
pan with a napkin, put the lid on, and let infuse for one hour. Beat up 
one pint of fresh sweet cream as for No. 1254, and let rest until needed. 
Place an ice-cream freezer in a tub, fill it up all round with broken ice 
mixed with rock-salt, wipe the cover nicely, and then remove it ; strain 
the infused preparation through a fine sieve into the freezer, put on the 
cover, then take hold of the handle, and turn th? freezer briskly in oppo- 
site directions for five minutes ; remove the cover, and with the spatula 
detach all the cream that adheres to the sides and bottom, recover, and 
turn sharply as before ; remove the cover, detach the cream from the 
sides and bottom, replace the cover, and begin turning again in opposite 
directions for five minutes longer. The cream should now be thoroughly 
frozen. Drop the whipped cream into the freezer, very little at a time, 
meanwhile mixing it gently with the spatula, which should take four min- 
utes to accomplish it; then have ready a three-pint, channeled, ice-cream 
mold, and with an ice-cream spoon fill the mold with the preparation, and 
put on the lid. Place some broken ice with rock-salt at the bottom, of a 
pail, lay the mold over, and fill up the pail with more ice and salt, then 
let freeze for fully one hour. Afterward remove the mold, dip it into 
lukewarm water, wipe away the ice and salt, and lift it up immediately, 
take off the cover, and turn the cream onto a cold dessert-dish with a 
folded napkin, and serve. 

1296. Rice and Cream a la Croce. Put one pint of cold milk into a 
saucepan, adding one pint of cold water and half a saltspoonful of salt, 
place the pan on the hot stove, and when boiling, throw in four ounces of 
well-cleaned, raw rice; then with a spatula stir slowly and continually at 
the bottom while it is cooking for twenty-five minutes, then take the pan 
from off the fire, lay it on a table, and add immediately four ounces of 
powdered sugar and one ounce of fresh butter ; mix well together with a 
spatula for two minutes, then transfer it into another vessel, and set it in 
a cold place for one hour to have it thoroughly cooled off. Whip to a 
froth one pint of sweet cream as for No. 1254, cover the basin with a nap- 
kin, and let rest for twenty minutes ; should there be any milk settled at 
the bottom, pour it off, and add to the cream two ounces of powdered 
sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring, then with a wire whip beat 
well together for two minutes longer, and remove the whip. Take the 
rice from the vessel, drop it gradually into the whipped cream, then mix 
the whole together slowly and carefully for three minutes. Line a two- 
quart, tin melon-form with three ounces of peach marmalade (No. 1331), 
fill the mold with the preparation, put on the cover, and after placing a 
little broken ice at the bottom of a pail, lay in the mold, and cover it 
entirely with broken ice (no salt is necessary for this), and let freeze for 
one hour. Have a vessel with two quarts of lukewarm water ; lift up 



72 THE TABLE. 



the mold from the pail, dip it into the water, wash off the ice, and raise 
it up immediately ; remove the cover, turn the preparation onto a cold 
dessert-dish, and send to the table. 

1297. Oranges Glacees a la George Renanldt. Have six fine, solid 
oranges, and with a pastry-tube, one and a quarter of an inch in diameter, 
cut off the tops of the oranges, then with a small knife remove the covers 
gently, laying them aside until later. With either a Parisian-potato cutter 
or a spoon, empty the insides of the oranges, being careful to avoid 
breaking any of the skin, for should that occur, they will be useless ; the 
interiors can be used for some other purpose. Arrange the oranges, with 
their covers on, in a square biscuit-glace box as for No. 1286 ; place the 
box in a tub, filling it with broken ice mixed with rock-salt, and let freeze 
for one hour. Prepare a champagne punch as for No. 1307, and with it 
fill the interior of the oranges, put on the covers, and with different col- 
ored ribbons tie each one, beginning at the top ; when at the bottom, turn 
the ribbon and bring it back to the top in an opposite direction, then make 
a graceful bow on top of the covers. Lay them again in the box, and let 
them freeze for one hour longet, then dress them on a dessert-dish with 
a folded napkin, and serve. 

1298. Macedoine Glacee a la Cavour. Prepare a pint of lemon ice- 
cream as for No. 1278, also a pint of coffee ice-cream (No. 1273), leaving 
them in their freezers. Take two ounces of candied cherries, cut in 
halves, two ounces of candied apricots, cut in slices, one ounce of candied 
angelica, cut into very small, lozenge-shaped pieces, two ounces of can- 
died pineapple, cut into very thin slices, and twelve French walnuts, 
shelled and divided. Have a three- pint, square ice-cream mold, place 
half the lemon ice-cream at the bottom, arrange a third part of the fruits 
nicely over, dividing them equally, then cover with half of the coffee ice- 
cream, and with a spoon press it down well. Lay half the remaining 
fruits on top of this, and spread over the rest of the lemon ice-cream, 
then the last of the fruits, and fill up the mold with the balance of the 
coffee ice-cream. Close very firmly, and lay it into a pail with broken ice 
mixed with rock-salt at the bottom, and filling it with the same, then let 
freeze for two hours. Two minutes before serving prepare a vessel with 
warm water, lift up the mold, and wash off the ice and salt, then unmold 
the macedoine immediately on a cold dessert-dish with a fancy paper 
over, and send it to the table. 

1299. Charlottes Glacees. Take six small charlotte-molds, and line 
them nicely with twelve biscuits a la cuillere (No. 1231) cut crosswise 
into halves. Have ready one pint and a half of vanilla ice-cream (No. 
1271), and fill the interiors of the molds with it, and turn them onto a des- 
sert-dish with a folded napkin over. Divide the remaining ice-cream 
evenly over the six charlottes, with one macaroon (No. 1210) on top of 
each, then send immediately to the table. 

1300. Charlottes Panachees. Have six charlotte-molds lined as for 
charlottes glacees (No. 1299); fill them with a pint of vanilla ice-cream 
(No. 1271), then turn them onto six cold dessert-plates. Take a pastry-

bag (No. 1079), slide down in it a fancy tube (No. 3), and pour into it a 
pint of whipped creme a la vanille (No. 1254); press a little of this onto 
the top of the charlottes, arrange over them six macaroons (No. 1210), 
press a little more cream about the size of a nut on the top of each maca- 
roon, then with the balance of the cream decorate the bottom of the char- 
lottes all around, and serve. 

1301. Meringues Glacees. Prepare a pint and a half of vanilla ice- 
cream (No. 1271), and with a round ice-cream spoon divide it evenly onto

(No. 1250), so as to nearly enclose the ice-cream, and then send to the 
table. 

1302. Meringues Panachees. Have six meringue-shells (No. 1250); 
divide evenly into them a pint of vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271). Slide into 
a pastry-bag (No. 1079) a fancy tube (No. 3), and pour into it a pint of 
whipped creme a la vanille (No. 1254) ; press half of it into six other 
meringue-shells, then join them to the other six containing the ice-cream. 
Lay them on six cold dessert-plates, and decorate the joints nicely with 
the balance of the cream, then send to the table at once. 

1303. Punch a la Lorenzo Delmonico. Put in a china bowl half a

pour into the freezer half a gill of St. Croix rum, a quarter of a gill of 
Delmonico's fine champagne cognac, and half a pint of Delmonico's cham- 
pagne. Cover immediately with the lid, and place the freezer in a narrow 
ice-cream tub, filling the latter all round with broken ice mixed with rock- 
salt ; then with the handle on the cover turn as sharply as possible for 
three minutes ; wipe the cover neatly, uncover, and with a wooden spoon 
detach the punch from the sides of the freezer, as also from the bottom ; 
cover again, turn the handle for three minutes more, uncover, detach the 
punch as before, cover, and repeat this three times as explained for the 
vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271). Have six. cold dessert-plates covered with 
fancy papers, each one having an L. D. designed on it ; fill six punch- 
glasses with the punch, arrange them on the plates, and send to the 
table. 

1304. Bomaine Punch. Make half the quantity of the preparation the

maraschino; put on the lid, and freeze it the same as for vanilla ice-cream 
(No. 1271), only serving it in six punch-glasses. 

1307. Champagne Punch. Have half the quantity of preparation 
described for orange water-ice (No. 1280), strain it through a sieve into 
the freezer, and add half a pint of good champagne. Place the cover on,

ing it in six punch-glasses. 

1308. Punch a la Lalla Rookh. Have ready half the quantity of 
preparation of vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271); strain it through a fine sieve 
into the freezer, adding one gill of Jamaica rum; freeze it the same, and 
serve it in glasses.

a pear, one of an apple, one of a banana, one of a tomato, one of a pine- 
apple, and one of a peach. Fill a tin pan with finely cracked ice well 
mixed with rock-salt, lay on it the six molds, opened flat, fill them with 
cold water, also the pan to half its height, and let it all rest for one hour; 
feel the inside of the molds to find whether a frozen crust adheres to them; 
if so, continue to finish the punch. Have any kind of desired punch 
ready; take up each mold separately, empty out the water, and fill 
them one after another; close tightly, and lay them in a pail previously 
prepared with broken ice and rock-salt at the bottom; cover them with 
plenty more ice and salt, and let freeze one hour. Have ready a cold 
dessert-dish with a folded napkin over; put some warm water in a vessel, 
take up each mold, one by one, dip them into the water, and hastily wash 
off any ice or salt which may adhere, unmold them carefully, and lay 
them nicely on the dessert-dish, and send to the table at once. 

1310. Punch a la Franqaisej Hot. Put in a saucepan on the hot 
range one pint of Jamaica rum, with twelve ounces of granulated sugar; 
stir continually with the spatula until reduced to half the quantity. Add 
the juice of three lemons, the juice of four sweet oranges, then set the 
pan on the corner of the stove to keep hot. Put into a tea-pot one ounce 
of green tea, pouring over it a pint of boiling water, and let infuse for ten 
minutes, then strain into the preparation; return it on the hot place, and 
when about boiling, skim thoroughly with a skimmer. Take it from the 
fire, pour it into a punch-bowl, and serve. 

1311. Punch a la FranC,aise ? Iced. Have a punch a la Francaise 
ready as for the above (No. 1310), and let cool off. Pour it into a small 
freezer, cover it, and lay it in a wooden tub filled with chopped ice all 
around. Sprinkle the ice well with rock-salt, and with the hands turn the 
freezer sharply around in opposite directions. While doing -this, stop 
every two minutes to detach the punch from around the freezer (using a 
spatula), so that it will be perfectly firm. If sharply handled, fifteen min- 
utes will suffice to freeze it thoroughly, then serve in six punch-glasses, 
dividing it equally. 

1312. Punch a la Czarina, Hot. Place in a copper or tin vessel one 
pound of granulated sugar, half a pint of Swiss kirsch, four ounces of St. 
Croix rum, and two ounces of good cognac. Light this mixture with a

match, and let it burn until the sugar is dissolved, then pour in a quart of 
Roederer's champagne, not colder than fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Squeeze 
in the juice of a good-sized mellow orange, and add twelve thin slices of 
pineapple; mix the whole well with a ladle, heat it slightly, being careful 
it does not boil, then pour the punch into a fancy bowl, and serve hot 
with six punch-glasses. 

1313. Champagne Cup. Squeeze the juice of half a good-sized, sound 
lemon into a fancy glass pitcher large enough to contain five pints; 
sweeten with one tablespoonful of powdered sugar, then add two ponies 
of red curacoa, one bottle of plain soda, and two slices of cucumber-rind. 
Pour in three pints of any brand of champagne, adding about a quarter of 
a pound of ice, then mix thoroughly with a spoon, and ornament the 
punch nicely with strawberries, very thin slices of pineapple, a finely 
sliced, medium-sized orange, and half a bunch of fine, fresh mint; send the 
cup to the table with six champagne-glasses. 

1314. Claret Cup. Have a glass pitcher holding two and a half 
quarts, or five pints; squeeze in the juice of three medium-sized, sound 
lemons, add four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, two ponies of red 
cura$oa, and two slices of cucumber-rind, then pour in three pints of 
claret, and one bottle of plain soda ; or a pint of either Clysmic, Apolli- 
naris, or carbonic water will answer. Mix thoroughly with a spoon, 
adding a lump of ice weighing about three quarters of a pound; mix again, 
then decorate with a finely sliced orange, cut into small pieces, berries of 
any kind, and finally with half a bunch of fresh mint. Serve in six punch- 
glasses, and the effect will be exceedingly pretty. 

1315. Water-lfielon a la Komero. Have a fine, sound, large, ripe 
water-melon, and with a very thin knife cut out a piece in the centre two 
inches square by three and a half inches deep; remove the piece carefully, 
and pour gradually into the inside one quart bottleful of champagne; 
replace the piece of melon in its former position, then lay the melon in 
the ice-box for six hours to infuse; set it on a silver dessert-dish, and send 
to the table, cutting it according to taste. 

1316. Water-melon a la Jose" Paez. Proceed and prepare exactly the 
same as for the above (No. 1315), only substituting one pint of Jamaica 
rum for the champagne, and serving the same. 

1317. Water-melon a la Seward. Prepare a water-melon as for No. 
1315, pouring into it one pint of Delmonico's cognac, instead of the cham- 
pagne, and serving it the same. 

1318. Sherry-wine Jelly. Put one quart of cold water into a sauce- 
pan with half a pound of granulated sugar; break in two ounces of gelatine 
in small pieces, and grate in the rind of a medium-sized lemon, squeezing 
in the juice as well. Mix well, and place the saucepan on the hot stove. 
Beat up in a basin two egg whites, and add them to the other ingredients, 
then grate in a saltspoonful of nutmeg, adding six cloves, and one bay- 
leaf, mixing well with the whip for one minute. Have ready a seamless 
jelly-bag (which can be purchased ready made), tie it on a jelly-stand, or 
if none handy, two kitchen chairs will answer the purpose. Stir the 



376 THE TABLE. 



preparation, and when coming to a boil, set it back to a cooler part of the 
stove to prevent it overflowing; stir, while boiling, for six minutes. Place 
a vessel under the jelly-bag, remove the pan from the fire, and pour the 
whole into the bag, immediately adding to it half a pint of good sherry 
wine, and a teaspoonful of burned sugar(No. 1265). Let it drain into the 
vessel, then return it to the bag, placing another vessel underneath, then 
let it drain through for fully two hours. Have a quart jelly-mold, pour 
the jelly from the vessel into it, and set it aside in a cool place for two 
hours, then put it into the ice-box to harden for two hours more. Prepare 
a cold dessert-dish, and after dipping the mold lightly and carefully to 
near its edge in lukewarm water, take it up immediately, and turn it onto 
the dish, wiping neatly the latter all around, then send to the table. 

1319. Kirsch Jelly. This jelly is to be prepared the same as the 
sherry-wine jelly (No. 1318), omitting the burned sugar, and replacingthe 
sherry w^ine by a gill of Swiss Kirschwasser, then serving it the same. 

1320. Jamaica-rum Jelly. Proceed exactly the same as for sherry- 
wine jelly (No. 1318), only substituting a gill of Jamaica rum for the 
sherry, then finish and serve the same. 

1321. Brandy Jelly. To be prepared precisely the same as the sherry- 
wine jelly (No. 1318), substituting a gill of good brandy for the sherry, and 
served the same as the other jellies. 

1322. Champagne Jelly. To be made the same as the sherry-wine 
jelly (No. 1318), suppressing the burned sugar, and using half a pint of 
Delmonico's champagne, instead of the sherry. To be served the same. 

1323. Kttmmel Jelly. Prepare and proceed exactly as for sherry-wine 
jelly (No. 1318), suppressing the burned sugar, and replacing the sherry 
by a gill of Russian kummel, sending it to the table the same as for the 
others. 

1324. Rhein-wine Jelly. The same as for sherry-wine jelly (No. 1318), 
omitting the burned sugar, and using half a pint of Lieberfraumilch wine, 
instead of the sherry, and serving the same. 

1325. Marcella-wine Jelly a la Castellar. To be made exactly the 
same as sherry-wine jelly (No. 1318,) using half a pint of Marcella wine in 
place of the sherry, and finished the same. 

1326. Currant Jelly. Select sixteen pounds of small, old Dutch cur- 
rants, not too ripe; those are preferable which are picked at the end of 
the month of June. Place them in a copper basin on the hot stove, 
and begin stirring them immediately from the bottom, using a wooden 
spatula; when they begin to scald, pour them into a clean tub, and with a 
pounder mash them thoroughly. Strain them through a flannel jelly-bag 
back into the copper basin, adding to the juice seven pounds of granulated 
sugar. Return the pan to the fire, and let boil until reduced to about half 
the quantity, then dip in a skimmer, lift it up, and feel the jelly with the 
two forefingers; close them, and open them slowly, if the jelly is 
mucilaginous, then it is done; if not, cook for a few minutes longer. 
Take it from the fire, and pour a little into every glass jar ready to use, 
as this will prevent them cracking. Afterwards fill them up. When 



DESSERTS. 377 



thoroughly cold, which will be in about two hours, during which time 
they must not be disturbed, cork them tightly, and put them in a closet. 
Currant jelly prepared in this way will keep in good condition for two 
years. 

1827. Apple Jelly. Put six good-sized apples into a saucepan after 
cutting them into quarters ; add a pint of cold water and a quarter of a 
lemon, then place it on a hot stove, and let boil for fifteen minutes. Place 
a sieve over a vessel, pour the contents of the pan onto it, and let drain 
thoroughly for fifteen minutes, then remove the sieve, and pour the apple 
juice into a saucepan with a pound of granulated sugar. Replace it on 
the hot stove, and let boil for thirty minutes, so that it be reduced to 
half, then take it from the fire, and pour it into a stone jar to cool off 
thoroughly, and use it when required for pies, cakes, or any other desired 
purpose. 

1328. Apple Sauce. Press the apples cooked in the above (No. 1327) 
through the sieve into a bowl, add half a pound of powdered sugar, a 
teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, and mix well together for two minutes, 
place it in a stone jar, and use when required. 

1329. Cranberry Sauce. Put in a saucepan one quart of fine, red, 
cleaned cranberries with a gill of water; place it on a hot stove and boil 
for fifteen minutes, then add five ounces of powdered sugar, and stir 
lightly with a spatula for five minutes. Remove it from the fire, pour it 
into a sieve over a vessel, and press well through with a wooden spoon. 
Transfer it into a stone jar, and use when required. 

1330. Stewed Prunes a la General Dufour. Procure ten ounces of 
the best imported prunes (which should invariably be purchased at a 
responsible dealer's), and put them in a vessel with a quart of cold water, 
letting them soak for four hours; then thoroughly drain them. Put them 
in a saucepan with half a pint of cold water, the zest of a sound lemon, 
a two-inch-length piece of cinnamon, two ounces of fresh butter, and four 
ounces of powdered sugar. Place the pan on a slow fire, and with the 
spatula stir carefully and gently once in a while, to avoid breaking them. 
After letting them cook slowly for two hours, remove the pan from the 
stove, and add immediately a pint of Bordeaux wine, replace it on the 
stove to heat thoroughly, but not allowing it to boil again ; take from off 
the fire, pour the prunes into a stone jar, let get cold, then serve. 

1331. Peach Marmalade. Peel and cut into slices twelve good-sized, 
sound peaches ; put into a saucepan half a pound of granulated sugar and 
a pint of cold water ; place it on a hot stove, and let come to a boil, then 
add the peaches, and cook for twelve minutes, stirring continually with 
the spatula. Remove from the fire, and strain through a pastry-sieve 
into a bowl, adding twelve peeled almonds (No. 1207), then let cool off 
thoroughly. Put it into a china bowl, lay it aside in a cool place, and 
use when needed. This marmalade will keep for several days if properly 
prepared. 

1332. Stewed Apples. Take six fine, sound Middletown pippin apples, 
peel them neatly, and with an apple-corer core them thoroughly, then cut 



TABLE. 



each apple into four quarters, and lay them in a saucepan with a pint of 
cold water, adding half a pound of granulated sugar. When the contents 
of the pan come to a boil, skim well, and then flavor with the juice of 
half an orange, or the same quantity of lemon, and a saltspoonful of 
ground cinnamon can also be added. When flavored, let cook for five 
minutes longer, and with a spatula stir slowly from the bottom to avoid 
mashing the apples. Remove from the fire, pour into a china bowl, and 
cool off thoroughly before serving. 

1333. Stewed Pears. Are to be prepared and cooked exactly the 
same as for the above (No, 1332). 

1334. Stewed Peaches. Peel and cut into quarters ten medium-sized, 
sound, ripe peaches, removing the stones, put them into a saucepan with 
a pint of cold water, adding half a pound of granulated sugar. Place the 
pan on the stove, and when boiling skim well ; let cook for five minutes, 
meanwhile stirring them slowly from the bottom, to avoid mashing the 
fruit; then remove, and immediately add a gill of kirsch, mixing well 
together for about half a minute. Pour into a china bowl, let get cool, 
then dress on a dessert-dish, and serve. 

1335. Stewed Apricots. Peel, cut, and stone twelve good-sized apri- 
cots, or fifteen if they be small; then proceed to prepare them exactly as 
for stewed peacries (No. 1334), only substituting a gill of brandy for the 
kirsch. 

1336. Stewed Green-gages. Have eighteen or twenty solid, ripe, 
green-gages, peel them neatly, cut them in halves, and stone them. Pro- 
ceed exactly the same as for stewed peaches (No. 1334), only replacing the 
kirsch by a gill of red cura9oa, and serving the same. 

1337. Stewed Plums. Proceed exactly the same as for the above (No. 
!336), substituting the same quantity of plums for the green-gages. 

1338. Stewed Quinces. Take twelve fine, firm, ripe quinces, peel and 
core them thoroughly, then cut them into quarters, and put them in a 
saucepan with a pint of cold water and half a pound of granulated sugar. 
Place them on the stove; when boiling, skim well, and let cook for fifteen 
minutes, stirring them gently at the bottom with a spatula to avoid mash- 
ing the fruit. Remove from the fire, and immediately add a gill of 
maraschino; stir lightly again, then pour into a china bowl to let cool. 
Dress on a dessert-dish and serve. 

1339. Syrup for Preserving Fruits. Put seven pounds of granulated 
sugar into a sugar-pan, adding five pints of cold water, and when on the 
hot stove, stir with the spatula until thoroughly heated, but it must not 
boil. Remove it from the fire, lay it aside, and use when needed for 
different fruits. The above quantity will produce five quarts at thirty 
degrees Fahrenheit. 

1340. Preserved Peaches. The best variety for preserving are 
either the " Crawford Late," or " Smoke." Select one hundred thoroughly 
ripe, sound, medium-sized peaches; peel them neatly, cut them in halves, 
and remove the stones with care. Have ready ten patent lightning-glass 
jars, each holding one quart, or twenty holding only a pint each; then divide 



D ESSEX TS. 379 



the peaches equally into them, and pour into each one pint of syrup 
prepared as for No. 1339, or half a pint, if using the pint jars, taking care 
that the peaches floating on the top should be entirely covered, even if it 
be necessary to press them down lightly. Put on the cover very tight, 
then bring the larger wire up in the very centre between the two small 
knobs, and press the smaller one downwards. Place the jars in a large 
saucepan standing, seeing that they do not touch each other, otherwise 
they might break, and arrange a little hay or straw between every one. 
Fill the pan with cold water so as to cover them entirely, and placing it 
on the hot stove, let boil for ten minutes. Take from off the fire, stand 
the pan on a table, and with a towel lift up the jars one by one, laying 
them most carefully on a dry kitchen table, and avoid putting them in a 
cold place. When all are so arranged, taking the towel into the hand, lift 
up the smaller wire, so that the gas slightly escapes for one minute, then 
immediately pull it down again until hermetically sealed. Let them stand 
till thoroughly cold, then put them away for general use. The right 
temperature for keeping them is from 65 to 75 degrees. Should the sauce- 
p'an not be sufficiently large to contain all the jars, boil five at a time. 

The best time to select the peaches is from August 20 to Sep- 
tember 20. 

1341. Preserved Bartlett Pears. Procure one hundred medium-sized^ 
sound, and fully ripe pears, fit to eat in their natural state; peel them 
carefully keeping them in their original form, then split in halves, and cut 
out the cores and seeds. Fill ten lightning-glass jars with the pears, 
and pour over five quarts of syrup (No. 1339), covering them tightly the 
same as for the peaches (No. 1340), placing them likewise in the saucepan, 
but boiling for fifteen minutes instead of ten. When lifted from the pan, 
proceed precisely as for the peaches. The best time to purchase the 
fruit is from August 25 to September 20. 

1342. Preserved Apples. Select sixty medium-sized, fine, sound, ripe 
Newtown pippins, the best time for this being from October I to Decem- 
ber i. Peel and core them with a corer, then cut them into quarters, 
and divide them equally into ten glass jars as for peaches (No. 1340). 
Fill them up with the syrup at thirty degrees, then cover tightly, put 
them in the saucepan exactly the same as for the peaches, and boil for 
fifteen minutes instead of ten. Take from off the fire, and finish the same 
as for the peaches, putting them away in the same temperature. 

1343. Preserved Egg-plums. Have two hundred medium sized egg- 
plums, ripe enough to break easily from the stones ; wash them care- 
fully, drain, then divide them equally into the ten quart lightning-jars. 
Fill them up with the thirty-degree syrup (No. 1339), cover tightly, and 
arrange them in the pan precisely as for peaches (No. 1340). Boil them 
for eight minutes instead of ten, then take from the stove, and finish pre- 
paring them exactly as for the peaches. The best time to procure these 
is from August 5 to September i. 

1344. Preserved Grreen-gages. Procure two hundred and fifty fine, 
ripe green-gages, selecting those which break easily from the stones ; 



380 THE TABLE. 



wash them well in cold water, drain thoroughly, then divide them equally 
into the ten patent glass jars, exactly as described for peaches (No. 1340). 
Fill up with five quarts of thirty-degree syrup (No. 1339), an d finish pre- 
paring them the same as for peaches, but boiling them only for eight 
minutes instead of ten ; put them away the same as the other fruits. The 
best time to procure green-gages is from August i to September i. 

1345. Preserved Strawberries. Always purchase the berries from 
June 7 to July 20, when residing in New York. Have fully the 
equivalent of ten quarts of well-picked and thoroughly washed, ripe, 
sound, and perfect strawberries, drain them well. To have these well 
selected it will doubtless require twenty-two to twenty-five quart baskets 
of unpicked fruit. When well drained, fill the ten quart lightning-glass 
jars with the berries, and pour in the thirty-degree syrup (No. 1339), but 
using it hot instead of cold. Cover them tightly, and proceed precisely 
the same as for peaches (No. 1340), only boiling them five minutes instead 
of ten, and putting them away the same. 

1346. Preserved Kaspberries. Have ready the equivalent of ten 
quarts of fine, ripe, solid, well- washed, and thoroughly drained raspber- 
ries ; sixteen quart baskets will be about the necessary quantity to pur- 
chase. When ready, fill up the ten lightning-glass jars, and proceed to 
prepare them as explained for peaches (No. 1340), the only exception 
being that they must be boiled five minutes instead of ten. The proper 
time to obtain the berries is from July 10 to July 20. 

1347. Preserved Cherries. Purchase twenty-five pounds of fine, 
sound, ripe, white wax cherries ; pick off the stems neatly, and should 
there be any unripe or spoilt ones among them, throw them away, as 
they would likely ruin the rest. When finished, there should be about 
twenty pounds of sound cherries suitable for preserving. Have ready 
ten quart lightning-glass jars, same as for the peaches (No. 1340); divide 
the picked cherries evenly into them, and fill up with the thirty-degree 
syrup (No. 1339). Cover them tightly and carefully, then arrange them 
in a large saucepan precisely the same as the peaches, and finish them 
exactly as described in that number, boiling them for the same length of 
time. June 15 to July i is the best time to obtain the fruit. 

1348. How to Boast Coffee. If practicable, procure a small family 
coffee-roaster. Have three quarters of a pound of Java, mixed with a 
quarter of a pound of Mocha, place it in the roaster, and taking one of the 
lids from off the stove, put the roaster on a moderate fire, and turn the 
small handle constantly and slowly until the coffee becomes a good brown 
color; for this it should take about twenty-five minutes; open the cover to 
see when it is done, then transfer it to an earthen jar, cover it tightly, and 
use when needed; or, a more simple way, and even more effectual, is to 
take a tin baking-dish, butter well the bottom, and placing the same 
quantity of coffee therein, put it in a moderate oven to let get a good 
golden color; twenty minutes will suffice for this, being careful to toss it 
frequently with a wooden spoon, then remove to an earthen jar. and cover 
it well. 



DESSERTS. 381 



Roasting one's own coffee is a sure way of having it always fresh; 
besides, it retains its full flavor; but care must also be taken to purchase 
coffee from a responsible, first-class dealer. 

1349. How to Make Black Coffee. Take six light tablespoonfuls of 
coffee-beans from the jar (No. 1348); grind them in a mill, neither too 
coarse nor too fine. Have a well-cleaned French coffee-pot, put the coffee 
on the filter, with the small strainer over, then pour on a pint and a half 
of boiling water, little by little, recollecting, at the same time, that too 
much care cannot be taken to impress on those making the coffee, the 
necessity of having the water boiling thoroughly, otherwise it were as 
useless to attempt the feat as to try and raise musk-melons at the North 
Pole, notwithstanding that the coffee be of the very first quality. When 
all the water is consumed put on the cover, and let infuse slightly, but on 
no account must it boil again; then serve in six after-dinner cups. Coffee 
should never be prepared more than five minutes before the time to serve. 

1350. Cafe Noir a PAlexander the Great. Put in an earthen pot on 
the hot range three pints of cold water; when boiling, immediately add 
four and a half ounces of freshly ground coffee, and as soon as the coffee 
has been added, put the pot on the corner of the stove to rest for three 
minutes. Have a piece of hot, red (very red) charcoal the size of a small 
banana, plunge it into the coffee. (If no charcoal at hand, a piece of red 
stove-coal will answer). Let rest again for three minutes; then you will see 
a heavy foam appearing at the surface of the coffee, thoroughly skim it off 
with a skimmer. Then carefully and gently pour it into a hot coffee-pot, 
and send to the table with six small, hot demi-tasses; accompanied with 
six ponies of old Renauldt cognac. , 

I would recommend that, after the scum has been removed, the coffee 
should be handled as gently as possible, so that all undesirable elements 
will remain at the bottom. 

1351. Cafe au Lait (Coffee With Milk). Have a clean French coffee- 
filter ready on the hot range ; place in it four and a half ounces of freshly 
ground coffee, as for No. 1349; then gradually pour over it, all around, 
half a pint of boiling water; let rest for three minutes, then gradually 
pour over two pints and a half more of boiling water (taking special care 
that, under no circumstances, should it be allowed to boil again after the 
water has been poured over). When all dripped down, pour it into a hot 
coffee-pot. Take three pints of good, freshly and thoroughly heated milk 
(but do not boil it), pour it into a hot pitcher, send to the table with six 
hot cups i cafeau lait, pouring into each cup half coffee and half milk. 

1352. Cafe au Lait a la St. Gottardo. Place in an earthen pot on the 
hot range two quarts of very fresh milk, and let it heat until near the boiling- 
point, then immediately add two and a half ounces of fresh, finely ground 
coffee (No. 1349). Shuffle the pot in contrary directions until it comes to 
a boil; then let it rest for three minutes. 

Strain it through a clean napkin into a hot serving-pitcher, and serve 
with six cafe-au-lait cups. 

1353. Cafe Glace (Iced Coffee). Prepare one quart of coffee as for 



382 THE 7 'ABLE. 



No. 1349, and also one quart of thoroughly heated milk (not boiled). 
Pour both coffee and milk into a small ice-cream freezer. Sweeten with 
three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; tightly cover the freezer, place 
it in a tub containing broken ice and rock-salt a little higher than the 
height of the coffee, then sharply turn it by the handle of the cover, in 
different directions, for five or six minutes; neatly wipe the cover of the 
freezer all around to avoid that any ice should fall in; and with the aid of 
a ladle pour it into a pitcher, and serve with six coffee-glasses, and 
powdered sugar separately. 

1354. The (Tea). Place in a tea-pot three heaped tablespoonfuls, or 
one and a half ounces, of the best English-breakfast tea, purchased from a 
responsible dealer. Pour over five pints of boiling water. See to it that 
the water is boiling, else, even with the best quality of tea, you will never 
succeed to have it made to perfection. Let infuse for five minutes (but 
do not boil again), then send to the table with a pint of cold milk, or a 
pint of sweet cream. 

The Glace (Iced Tea). Prepare the same quantity of tea the same as 
above, pour into an ice-cream freezer, sweeten, and proceed the same as 
for iced coffee (No. 1353), (omitting the milk); pour it into a cold pitcher, 
and send to the table with six coffee-glasses, six slices of sound lemon, and 
powdered sugar separately. 

1855. Th6 a la RUSSC (Russian Tea). Place in a tea-pot three heaped 
tablespoonfuls of English-breakfast tea; pour over a little boiling water, 
just sufficient to cover the tea, about two tablespoonfuls; let infuse for 
one minute, then draw the water out, but do not use it. Pour in half a 
pony of good old Jamaica rum and three pints of boiling water; let infuse 
for four minutes, and then serve in cup with a decanter of old Jamaica 
rum separately, thin slices of lemon, and powdered sugar. 

This is the old Russian style. Later fashion is to flavor it with a little 
vanilla flavor and a few drops of lemon juice. 

1856. HOW to Make Chocolate. Select three quarters of a pound of 
good chocolate (Maillard's is preferable), break it into pieces, and put 
thern in a saucepan on the stove with half a pint of boiling water ; stir 
well with a wooden spoon, and when the chocolate is thoroughly dis- 
solved pour one quart of boiling water over, using a quart of milk instead 
of the water when chocolate and milk is desired. Let it cook well for ten 
minutes, then serve. 

1357. Chocolat au Lait aja Georg-e Washington. Have a stone pot 
on the hot range with half a pint of cold water. Break in six tablets of 
one ounce each of Maillard's chocolate, sharply mix with a very clean 
wooden spoon or spatula until it is thoroughly dissolved ; then add two 
quarts of good cold milk, thoroughly heat until it comes to a boil, mixing 
lightly with the wooden spoon meanwhile. Pour it into a hot pitcher, 
and send to the table with cups and powdered sugar separately. 

A pinch of salt represents 205 grains, or a tablespoonful. 

Half a pinch of pepper represents 38 grains, or a teaspoonful. 

A third of a pinch of nutmeg represents 13 grains, or half a teaspoonful.

1358. Lobster a la Rushmore. Select three fine, fresh lobsters, each 
weighing two pounds; boil them in salted water for ten minutes, then 
take them out and put to cool for eighteen minutes. Pick out all the 
meat, leaving the main body-shells intact for further use. Mince up the 
tail-parts, coral, and claws into pieces a quarter of an inch thick by three 
quarters of an inch wide. Put a sautoire containing half an ounce of fresh 
butter on the hot stove; chop up very fine one good-sized, sound shallot, 
add it to the butter in the pan, also the minced lobster, and season with a 
light pinch of salt, a light saltspoonful of cayenne pepper, and half a 
glassful of good white wine; let the whole reduce for ten minutes, stirring 
it meanwhile with a wooden spoon. Add one tablespoonful of tomato 
sauce (No. 205), four tablespoonfuls of Espagnole sauce (No. 151), and 
six mushroom-stalks chopped up very fine. Let cook well for ten minutes 
longer, then set the sautoire on the corner of the stove to keep warm. 
Take the .three main shells of the lobsters, split them evenly in two, 
lengthwise, pare the ends off neatly, wash them thoroughly, and wipe 
them dry. These shells should not be longer than four and a half inches. 
Fill the six shells with the prepared lobster, lay two mushroom heads on 
top of each, put them on a tin plate and pour over the remainder of the 
sauce in the sautoire. Set them in the hot oven to bake for five minutes, 
then remove and dress them on a hot dish with a folded napkin, and send 
to the table. 

1359. Haw Hamburg Steak. Chop up two pounds of beef the same 
as for cooked Hamburg steak (No. 526), only selecting more tender pieces, 
and return it to the machine two or three times so as to have it finer. 
Season with one large pinch of salt, half a pinch of pepper, and the third 
of a pinch of nutmeg. Place the meat on a dish, divide it into six small, 
flattened steaks, and throw a raw egg yolk over each one; garnish with 
two shallots, one tablespoonful of parsley, the same quantity of capers, 
and three anchovies, all finely minced, and arranged in clusters around the 
dish. 

1360. Mignons of Lamb, Sauce Bearnaise. Procure a fine, tender leg 
of lamb, bone it with a sharp knife so as to detach the meat from the 
knuckle, beginning from the hip-side downwards. Cut out from this six 
even pieces or steaks, one inch thick by two and a half in diameter, pare 
them nicely, and with a small, keen knife remove any sinews that are 
liable to adhere to the meat. Lay them on a cold dish, and season with a 
good pinch of salt and a light pinch of pepper, and roll them well, so that 



THE TABLE. 



the seasoning be equally distributed. Put half an ounce of good butter 
in a frying-pan, set it on a brisk fire, and add the pieces, or mignons, im- 
mediately, being careful that they do not lay one on top of the other, and 
cook them very briskly for two and a half minutes on each side. Prepare 
half a pint of Bearnaise sauce (No. 166), pour it on a hot serving-dish, 
dress the six mignons nicely over, one overlapping the other, and send to 
the table immediately. 

Any lamb that may be left over after cutting off the mignons can be 
utilized for minced lamb, soup, or any other purpose desired. 

13B1. Hind-quarter of Spring Lamb. Procure a medium-sized, fine, 
white hind-quarter of lamb ; pare it neatly, trim the small handle-bone, 
and fold the flank over the ribs, to prevent them being overdone; that 
means that the leg and ribs will be equally cooked the same length of 
time. Tie it well together, then season with one and a half pinches of 
salt divided evenly, and envelop it well in its caul or leaf-fat ; lay it in a 
roasting-pan, pouring in one tablespoonful of broth or water, then place 
it in a moderate oven, and let roast for one hour, basting it occasionally 
with its own dripping. Take it from the oven, remove the caul, untie, 
and dress it on a hot dish, adjusting a neat paper ruffle to the handle- 
bone. Skim the fat from off the gravy, strain the latter over the lamb, 
and serve. 

1362. Chicken, Saute a la Ch. C. Delmonico. Select from a good 
poultry-dealer two fine, tender Philadelphia spring-chickens weighing 
two pounds each. Singe them over a little alcohol poured onto a plate, 
draw the entrails, wash well the interiors, then wipe them dry with a 
clean cloth. Cut each chicken into six pieces, place them in a sautoire 
with two tablespoonfuls of sweet oil, season with a good pinch of salt and 
one pinch of pepper, then set the sautoire on a very brisk fire, and let 
cook until the pieces assume a good, light brown color (ten minutes will 
suffice), stirring them lightly in the meanwhile. Chop up very fine one 
sound shallot ; cut one green pepper into small, dice-shaped pieces, also 
the end part only of a medium-sized, peeled carrot ; place all these with 
the chickens, and let cook together for one minute and a half, then add 
one glassful of good white wine, and let the liquid reduce to one-half, 
which will take ten minutes on a brisk fire, stirring it occasionally. Now 
add one gill of Espagnole sauce (No. 151), a tablespoonful of tomato 
sauce (No. 205), the juice of a good-sized, very sound lemon, and a quar- 
ter of an ounce of fresh butter ; let all cook for ten minutes longer, stir- 
ring it lightly with a spoon. Plunge three canned artichoke-bottoms into 
very hot water, lift them up immediately with a skimmer, wipe them 
thoroughly dry with a napkin, then cut each one into four quarters ; slice 
three medium-sized truffles very fine, and add all these to the chickens 
two minutes before serving. Dress the chickens and sauce on a very 
hot serving-dish, adjust paper ruffles to the ends of the four legs ; gar- 
nish the dish artistically with the artichokes star-shaped. Place a slice of 
truffle on the centre of each artichoke, and a very small, round slice of 
Spanish sweet pepper on top of each truffle, and send to the table very hot. 



S UPPLEMENT. 385 



1363. Chicken, Saute a la Ranhofer. Select two fine, tender chickens 
weighing two pounds each ; singe them well, draw the entrails, wash 
thoroughly, and wipe very dry; then cut each chicken into six pieces, and 
season them with a good pinch of salt and a light pinch of pepper. Place 
the pieces of chicken in a sautoire with three quarters of an ounce of 
good butter and half a tablespoonful of sweet oil, and set it on a very 
hot stove. Chop up one shallot very fine, and one sound, green pepper 
cut in small, dice-shaped pieces ; when the chickens are of a light brown 
color, add the shallot and pepper, and stir well for one minute; then add 
a wine-glassful of good white wine, and let reduce to one quarter, which 
will take six minutes. Pour in one gill of tomato sauce (No. 205) and one 
and a half gills of Espagnole sauce (No. 151), and let cook rather slowly 
for ten minutes longer, stirring it occasionally. Dress the chickens and 
sauce on a very hot serving-dish, adjust paper ruffles on the ends of 
the four legs, and decorate the dish with the following garnishing : take 
six canned artichoke-bottoms, spread a tablespoonful of Duxelle (No. 215) 
in the centre of each one ; empty the interiors of six fine, sound, medium- 
sized green peppers, cooked in the oven for five minutes, stuff them with 
Duxelle garnishing (No. 189), and arrange them on top of. the artichokes, 
their thin part uppermost, so as to give them a pyramidal shape; then 
lay them on a buttered tin plate or dish, and set them in a slow oven to 
bake for five minutes ; remove them, but while they are baking cut out 
six round pieces of fresh bread, half an inch thick by two and a half 
inches in diameter ; place them on a hot stove in a frying-pan with half 
a tablespoonful of butter, and let get a light brown color for two minutes. 
Arrange the six artichokes and peppers on top of the 'pieces of bread, 
garnish the dish nicely, and send to the table at once. 

1364. Filets Millions a la Lorillard. After preparing six timbales 
as described below, and when removed from the oven, have ready six 
fine filets mignons as for No. 509, and serve with the following garnish- 
ing and sauce: take six small timbale-molds, measuring one and three 
quarter inches in diameter and two inches deep ; butter well the insides, 
and set them in the ice-box to get thoroughly cold. Have one medium- 
sized, cooked carrot, also one cooked turnip; cut them both with a tube a 
quarter of an inch in diameter by one inch long ; have also half a 
medium-sized, fine, white cabbage, and trim the outer leaves neatly. Put 
into a stewpan one ounce of salt pork cut into small dice-shaped pieces; 
add the cabbage, and season with half a pinch of pepper ; set the pan on a 
rather slow fire, cover it tightly, and let cook slowly for thirty minutes, 
without removing the lid ; during this time decorate the six cold timbales 
by laying a slice of truffle, half an inch in diameter, at the bottom of each, 
and just in the centre, and with the aid of a larding-needle arrange a row 
of cooked green peas around this, then decorate half the interior of each 
timbale with half the prepared carrots and turnips, using the utmost care, 
and keeping them inclining slightly toward the right, and the other half 
inclining toward the left. Fill up the timbales with the cooked cabbage, 
using a spoon to press it in gently, so that they are filled entirely as far 

25 



386 THE TABLE. 



as the top. Put them on a roasting-pan, filling it with hot water to half 
the height of the timbales, then place them in a hot oven, and heat from 
three and a half to four minutes. Take them from the oven, and leave 
the pan on the corner of the stove to keep warm. Cut an oval-shaped 
slice from an American loaf of bread, one inch in thickness, pare the edges 
neatly, then butter it lightly, and place it in the oven on a tin plate to get 
a light brown color; two minutes will be sufficient for this; lay it on a 
very hot dish, and dress the six filets mignons on top of the bread 
croustade, each one lengthwise and slightly overlapping one another, and 
so on until all are used. Pour over the mignons half a pint of hot Colbert 
sauce (No. 190), to which add whatever parings or pieces of truffle 
remain, one minute before using; then with a towel remove the timbales 
from the pan, one after the other, turn them upside down, unmold, and 
with these decorate the dish, placing one at each end and two on each 
side, then send to the table immediately. 

It would be advisable to prepare and cook the fillets after the timbales 
are removed from the oven. 

,1365. Flageolets Sautes au Beurre. Take three quarters of a quart 
can of fine, French flageolet beans, parboil them in boiling and lightly 
salted water for one and a half minutes, then drain them on a colander, 
and place them immediately in a saucepan on the hot stove with an ounce 
of good butter ; season with a teaspoonful of salt, and shuffle lightly 
with a wooden spoon while cooking for three minutes, and when serving, 
add half a teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley. Dress them on a hot 
dish, and serve. 

1306. Eggs a la Post. Wash and scrape neatly one good-sized, sound 
carrot, then, with a vegetable-scoop, scoop out twelve round pieces; place 
them in a sautoire with one gill of white broth (No. 99), and a teaspoon- 
ful of good butter. Cook them on the hot range for twenty minutes. 

Place twelve fine, sound, roasted, and shelled Italian chestnuts 
into the sautoire with the carrots, let come to a boil. Remove all the 
skin from two uncooked sausages. Make twelve equal balls out of it, 
place on a tin plate, and bake in the hot oven four minutes. Remove, and 
add them to the carrots and chestnuts. Season with a light pinch of salt 
and the third of a saltspoonful of red pepper; add one gill of Madeira sauce 
(No. 185). Cook for two minutes longer. Have a silver dish sufficiently 
large to contain twelve eggs so that they do not touch one another. 
Place in the centre of the dish half a pint of hot puree of chestnuts (No. 
131), then arrange twelve fried eggs over the puree prepared the same 
as in No. 412. Carefully and equally divide in clusters around the dish, 
the carrots, chestnuts, and sausage balls, then pour the sauce around the 
eggs with a spoon, but none over the eggs. Place on top of each egg 
one thin slice of truffle cut with a tube. Place in the hot oven to heat for 
one minute. Take from out the oven, and serve. 

1367. Oysters Fried a la Arthur Sullivan. Carefully open thirty 
large, fine, fresh box-oysters; place them in a saucepan with their own 
juice, season with the third of a saltspoonful of red pepper, adding half a 



SUPPLEMENT. 387 



medium-sized fine, sound lemon, cut into thin slices, one sprig of thyme, 
a small bay-leaf, and a branch of well-washed parsley. Place on the hot 
range, and heat up very fast without boiling, for which, on a very brisk 
fire, it should be done in one minute and a quarter; then place the whole 
in an earthen bowl to cool. 

Beat up one raw egg in a bowl with one gill of cold milk, seasoned 
with a light pinch of pepper and a light pinch of salt; steep the oysters in 
this, one by one, then lightly roll them in cracker-dust; give them a nice 
even shape in the palm of the hand, and lay them on a dish. Heat up 
thoroughly in a frying-pan on the hot range one gill of clarified butter 
and half a gill of olive oil (it must be very hot before placing in the 
oysters), and fry them for one minute on each side. Remove them with 
a skimmer, dress on a hot dish with a folded napkin, and serve with the 
following sauce separately: 

Strain the juice of the oysters into a saucepan, and reduce it to one 
half on the hot range, with half a saltspoonful of red pepper, adding also 
the juice of half a sound lemon and a gill of sauce Espagnole (No. 151). 
Cook for three minutes, add a teaspoonful of chopped chives, pour it into 
a sauce-bowl, and send to the table. 

1368. Lobster Salad a la Boardman. Split lengthwise two very fine 
medium-sized, freshly boiled, and cooled lobsters; pick all the meat out 
from the shells, as well as from the cracked claws, suppress both intes- 
tines and pouch. Cut the meat into very small, equal, square pieces, and 
place them in a salad-bowl. Finely chop up, as fine as hashed potatoes, 
three hard-boiled eggs; add them to the lobster. Peel and chop, also very 
fine, two small, sound shallots, and add to the lobster, with one and a half 
teaspoonfuls of very fine freshly chopped chives and one and a half tea- 
spoonfuls of finely chopped parsley. Chop also, very fine, one root of 
thoroughly pared and well-cleaned sound celery (using nothing but the 
perfect white), add it to the lobster. Season with a light tablespoonful 
and a half of salt, a teaspoonful and a half of fresh, finely crushed white 
pepper, half a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, a tablespoonful and 
a half of olive oil, two tablespoonfuls of very good white vinegar. Mix 
well, then add three tablespoonfuls of freshly made mayonnaise sauce 
(No. 206). Gently but thoroughly mix the whole well together; wipe 
neatly the edges of the salad-bowl with a napkin. Plant right in the 
centre a branch of parsley-greens, and send to the table. 

1369. Game Pie a la LeviP. Morton. Take one fine partridge, one 
grouse, and one medium-sized rabbit ; pick, draw, and singe well. Thor 
oughly bone them. Place the fillets in a saucepan with one tablespoonful 
of clarified butter. Season with one pinch of salt, half a pinch of pepper, 
and a quarter of a pinch of thyme. Cook on a brisk fire for one minute 
on each side ; then add half a glassful of good Madeira wine, and reduce 
to one half, which will take five minutes. Place in a bowl and let thor- 
oughly cool. Chop up the bones into fine pieces ; place them in a sauce- 
pan with one medium-sized, sound onion cut into slices, a small carrot 
cut the same, one bay-leaf, three cloves, twelve whole peppers, and a

blade of thyme. Cook all together with one ounce of butter until it has 
obtained a light brown color ; then add one glassful of Madeira wine, 
half a medium-sized, sound lemon cut in slices, one quart of white broth 
(No. 99), and two ounces of gelatine. Let cook one hour. Then strain 
through a napkin or a fine sieve into a china bowl, and lay aside to thor- 
oughly cool. Chop up very fine a quarter of a pound of lean, raw veal, 
a quarter of a pound of fresh pork, and six ounces of larding-pork. Sea- 
son with one good pinch of salt and half a pinch of pepper. Cut into dice- 
shaped pieces eight truffles, three ounces of cooked smoked beef-tongue ; 
mix well together, and it will be ready for use. Knead well together, on 
a marble table, wooden board, or in a vessel, half a pound of flour with 
four ounces of butter, then gradually add a gill of cold water, mixing well 
until it is a perfect dough, for five minutes at least without ceasing. Then 
place it in a cool place, and let rest ten minutes before using. Lightly 
butter the interior of an oval-shaped mold ten inches in length, six inches 
wide, and four and a half high. Place the mold in an iron roasting-pan. 
Roll out three quarters of the dough to one quarter of an inch thick, and 
with it evenly line the inside of the mold, taking special care not to make 
any holes in the dough. Cut some very thin slices of larding-pork, and line 
the dough all around with it. Then place one layer of the forcemeat and 
one layer of the game, and so on, until all is used. Make a hole with a 
teaspoon right in the centre down to half the depth of the patty (pate). 
Roll out the other quarter of dough to the same thickness, quarter of an 
inch ; cut a cover out oval-shaped, and with it cover the pate, making a 
small hole in the centre to connect with the other. Decorate the surface 
with leaves made out of the dough, glaze it with the yolk of one fresh 
egg and half a gill of cold water. Place in a moderate oven to cook for 
two hours. Remove from the oven. Put away in the ice-box for six 
hours. 

1370. Plombiere a la Hamilton. Beat up one and a half pints of 
sweet cream as in No. 1254. Let it rest for half an hour. Neatly pick 
one and a half pints of sound, ripe strawberries ; carefully wash them in 
cold water, then drain them on a colander. Transfer the whipped cream 
into another vessel with a skimmer. Briskly beat the cream again for 
two minutes. Mix in three ounces of powdered sugar, one teaspoonful of 
vanilla flavor, and half a gill of cognac. Mix the whole well together for 
one minute longer. Remove the wire whip, add the prepared strawber- 
ries, and with the aid of a wooden spoon gently mix for one minute. 
Pour the preparation into a well-cleaned, two-quart freezer, cover, and 
lay it into a pail ; fill the pail all around with broken ice (but no rock- 
salt), and let freeze for one hour. Have a fruit-stand ready, then with an 
ice-cream spoon dress the plombiere on the stand, giving a dome shape, 
and immediately send to the table. 

The above makes a delicious dessert, also, when served without being 
frozen. 

1371. Tutti-frutti a la Gen. Harrison. Line the interior of a three- 
pint melon-form with a pint of vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271). Cut four 



SUPPLEMENT. 389 



ounces of candied apricots into small pieces, also four ounces of candied 
cherries into halves. Mix these together. Evenly spread half the quan- 
tity of the fruits all around the ice-cream in the form. Carefully arrange 
a pint of raspberry water-ice (No. 1281) evenly around the fruits. Spread 
the balance of the fruits all around the water-ice ; then fill the form with 
a pint of pistache ice-cream (No. 1275). Tightly cover the form. Lay it 
in a pail with a layer of broken ice and rock-salt at the bottom, and then 
fill up to the surface with the same. Let freeze for one and a half hours. 
Unmold the tutti-frutti ; dress on a glass stand, and serve with the fol- 
lowing sauce : put in a vessel a pint of whipped cream (No. 1254) with 
two ounces of powdered sugar and a gill of maraschino. Beat the whole 
well together for two minutes. Pour it over the tutti-frutti, and immedi- 
ately send to the table. 

1372. Frogs' Legs a la Merrill. Neatly pare off the claws of half a 
pound of very fine, fat, fresh frogs' legs. Cut them into pieces at each 
joint. Place them in a saucepan on the hot range, with half an ounce of 
very good butter. Season with one pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful 
of red pepper. Cook on a brisk fire for five minutes, then add a wine- 
glassful of Madeira wine, with two finely minced truffles; reduce for three 
minutes. Crack into a bowl three egg yolks, add to it half a pint of 
sweet cream, beat well together one minute, pour it into the pan with the 
frogs, then gently shuffle the pan in opposite directions until the sauce 
thickens, which will take two minutes and a half. Pour into a hot soup- 
tureen, and serve. 

1373. Strawberries. After selecting and thoroughly washing the 
berries, fill the cans and cover with a twenty-five-degree syrup, seal up, 
and cook five minutes. Open the vent, to let hot air out, about one min- 
ute, then close the vent and put away. The best berries are in market 
between June 7 and 14. 

1374. Pineapple. The best pineapples (the sugar-loaf) come to 
market between June 15 and July 15. After selecting the ripest fruit, 
pare and cut all the eyes out, take the core out, cut in slices, and fill 
cans ; cover with a twenty-five-degree syrup ; seal up and cook twenty 
minutes. Open vent to let hot air out, close, and put away. 

1375. Asparagus. The best asparagus for canning is the Colossal, 
from Monmouth County, New Jersey, and the best time from May 12 
to June 12. After selecting the large, perfect spears, wash thoroughly, 
then scald about ten minutes, and after filling the cans full, cover with a 
light salt water, and seal the cans up, leaving the vent open; then cook 
ten minutes ; then close the vent and cook two and one half hours. Open 
vent to let the gas out, and close it again. 

1376. Rhubarb, or Pie-plant. After peeling and cutting the rhubarb 
in pieces about one "inch long, fill cans and cover with a light syrup, seal 
up, and boil five minutes ; open vent to let the air out, close, and put 
away. The best time is from May 20 to June I. 

1377. Cherries. The best cherry, the white Ox-heart, ripens between 
June 20 and July i. Select the fruit, fill cans, and cover with a twenty- 



THE TABLE. 



five-degree syrup, seal up, cook fifteen minutes, open vent, close, and 
put away. 

1378. Gooseberries. Select the berries when green, between June 
17 and July i. After filling the cans, cover with a light syrup, seal up, 
and bathe five minutes, open vent, close, and put away. 

1379. Currant Jelly. The best jelly can only be made before the cur- 
rants are fully ripe between June 25 and July 3. After scalding the 
currants well, press them through a flannel bag, and while the juice is 
hot, boil six or seven pounds of the best crushed sugar with one gallon of 
juice, watching closely until it attains the proper consistency; then pour 
in molds to cool. 

Another way to make a very delicate jelly is to boil one gallon of juice 
about ten minutes, and while boiling hot stir in eight pounds of granulated 
sugar, and keep stirring until all dissolved, then pour into molds. 

1380. Raspberries. The best time is between July 5 and 15, and pro- 
ceed same as strawberries. 

1381. Blackberries and Whortleberries between July 15 and August 
15. After carefully washing the berries, put on any degree of syrup you 
wish, as this fruit will make pies or do for the table. Seal up, and cook 
eight minutes; open vent, close, and put away. 

1382. Peas, Corn, and Lima Beans are so hard to keep that it is im- 
possible for a family to put them up. They require a greater heat than 
boiling water, and have to be cooked in a super-heated steam chest. 

1383. Egg-plains and Green-gages are best when nearly ripe be- 
tween August 15 and September i. After filling cans cover with a 
twenty-five-degree syrup and cook ten minutes, then open the vents, close 
and put away. 

1384. Tomatoes. Between August 15 and September 15, select 
thoroughly ripe tomatoes, scald them about two minutes in hot water, so 
that the skin will peel off very thin to leave the perfect shape of the fruit; 
then fill the cans as full as you can press them in; seal them and cook 
twenty minutes, then put away. 

1385. Peaches and Bartlett Pears. Last of August to last of Septem- 
ber, select ripe fruit; pare carefully; fill cans and cover with a twenty-five- 
degree syrup; seal up, cook twenty minutes, then open vent, close and 
put away. 

1386. String Beans are best in October. Select the small refugee 
beans; after taking strings off. wash and scald well; then fill cans with 
whole beans, and cover with a light brine. Seal up; cook one half hour, 
then open vent, close again, and cook three fourths of an hour more, then 
put away. 

1387. Apples. Newtown pippins are the best about November 15. 
Pare and quarter; take cores out; then fill cans and cover with any 
strength syrup required. Seal up, and cook five minutes, open vent, 
close and put away. t 

Six pounds of the best crushed sugar to a gallon of water will make 
a syrup of twenty to twenty-five degrees. 



S UPPLEMENT, 3 9 1 



1388. Tenderloin Broil a la Stanton. Prepare three fillets exactly as 
in No. 503, and one minute before they are cooked, lightly devil them on 
both sides ; then broil half a minute on each side. 

Chop very fine one small, well-peeled, sound shallot, place it in a small 
saucepan on the hot range with a teaspoonful of butter, fry for one min- 
ute; then add half a glassful of good white wine, and reduce to one half. 
Add one medium-sized, sound pickle, and one sweet pepper cut into small 
dice-shaped pieces. Season with half a pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful 
of red pepper; add half a gill of Spanish sauce (No. 151). Cook for one 
minute rather briskly, then pour the sauce on a hot serving-dish, dress 
the fillets over it; arrange six heart-shaped croutons (No. 133) around the 
dish, place a slice of truffle on top of each crouton, then a round slice of 
Spanish sweet pepper, cut with a tube, over each slice of truffle, and send 
to the table. 

1389. Filets Mignons a la Brown. Chop very fine one medium-sized, 
sound, peeled shallot, place it in a small saucepan on the hot range, with 
a teaspoonful of very good butter; heat well for one minute without 
browning; add half a wine-glassful of good Madeira wine, boil for two min- 
utes, then add half a teaspoonful of freshly chopped tarragon, one good-sized 
sweet pepper cut in small dice-shaped pieces, twelve stoned and stuffed 
olives, six whole mushrooms, and one artichoke-bottom, cut in dice- 
shape, also a gill of sauce Espagnole (No. 151). Season with half a 
pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful of red pepper. Cook for three min- 
utes and a half, then pour this garnishing on a hot serving-dish. Nicely 
dress over it six freshly cooked mignons filets as in No. 509, one over- 
lapping another; decorate the dish with six heart-shaped croutons (No. 
133), and serve. 

1390. Broiled Grouse a la Pomeroy. Prepare and broil three fine, 
tender grouse, precisely the same as for No. 854, but one minute before 
they are cooked, lightly devil them, and then gently broil again for half 
a minute on each side. 

Place in a small saucepan on the hot range one medium-sized, sound, 
peeled, and finely chopped shallot, with a tablespoonful of good butter; 
cook for one minute, then add two chopped mushrooms, one chopped 
pickle; moisten with a tablespoonful of English sauce; add alight tea- 
spoonful of English mustard; mix all well together. Season with half a 
pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful of red pepper. Cook for one minute 
and a quarter. Pour the sauce on a hot serving-dish, place the grouse 
over it, decorate the dish with six slices of broiled bacon (No. 754), six 
thin half slices of lemon; arrange six slices of truffles in the centre of the 
slices of lemon, and serve very hot. 

1391. Mazagran a la General Bngeaii. This will be found a superior 
and pleasantly stimulating summer beverage for ladies, as well as for the 
sterner sex. 

Prepare the same quantity of coffee as in No. 1349. Have six goblets 
half filled with clean ice, pour in the coffee, evenly divided; add a pony 
of good cognac- to each glass, mix thoroughly with a teaspoon, and serve. 



3Q2 THE TABLE. 



The above is a delicious and healthful after-dinner summer drink, and 
is enjoyed in nearly all the large cities of Europe, especially by military 
men, who prefer it to the usual after-dinner demi-tasse, or " gloria," as 
they call it in Paris. 

The name is derived from the village of Mazagran, Province d'Oran, 
Algeria, famous for a long and heroic siege in 1840, wherein one hundred 
and twenty-three French soldiers were victorious against twelve thousand 
Arabs. 

1392. Mazagran a la General Dufour. The same as above, only sub- 
stituting a pony of Swiss kirsch instead of cognac. 

1393. Smelts a la Van Volkenburg-h. Wash well, and thoroughly 
dry, eighteen fine, fresh Long Island smelts. Split them right along the 
backbone in the centre; remove the backbone of each. Season with a 
pinch of salt and half a pinch of pepper; sprinkle them with half an ounce 
of flour, then place them in a pan with one ounce of good butter on the hot 
range, and fry for two minutes on each side, or until they obtain a good 
light brown color. Dress them on a hot dish; place in a pan one ounce of 
good butter, fry it until it becomes of a good nut-brown color; add to it a 
tablespoonful of vinegar, then pour over the smelts; decorate the dish all 
around with parsley-greens, and serve. 

1394. Tomatoes with Rice a la Watson. Wash in cold water six fine, 
red, sound, equal-sized tomatoes, wipe them dry, then cut off the top of 
each tomato (keeping them on a plate until needed); remove the seeds of 
the tomatoes with a vegetable-scoop. Season the inside of each with half 
a pinch of pepper and half a pinch of salt. 

Place them in a well-buttered pan. Place two ounces of well-picked 
rice in a cup or in a dish, add to it one teaspoonful of melted butter, 
half a medium-sized, sound, peeled, and finely chopped shallot; season 
with half a pinch of salt only, mix all well together, then put into 
each tomato one teaspoonful of rice; place the tops on as a cover, sprinkle 
a little clarified butter over, and then cover them with a well-buttered 
paper. Bake them in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. 

Thoroughly wash six large, fresh mushrooms. Cut off the stalks, chop 
up very fine half a sound, peeled shallot, as well as the mushroom stalks, 
place in a pan with a tablespoonful of good butter and two drops of lemon 
juice. Season with half a pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful of pepper. 
Cook five minutes, without browning, then add the mushroom-tops, with 
half a glassful of Madeira wine; reduce for two minutes; add now half a 
gill of demi-glace (No. 185); let cook for five minutes longer. 

Dress the tomatoes on a hot serving-dish, place one head of mush- 
room on top of each tomato, upside down, pour a little of the sauce over 
the six mushrooms, and the rest on the dish around the tomatoes; arrange 
a thin slice of truffle on top of each head of mushroom, and send to the 
table. 



HOW TO CARVE. 393 



HOW TO CARVE. 



THE art of cookery and carving is an old one. During the Roman 
Empire it was taught by professors in the schools, and had at that time 
attained a high standard. France leads all nations in the art of cooking 
and carving, although the United States is not far behind in this respect. 

Good cooking and carving go hand in hand. It is no trifle to prepare 
and cook a good dinner; but it is an easy matter to spoil the effect, if not 
the entire dinner, by negligent carving. 

The first and most important factor is a strong and very sharp knife. 

Chickens. Lay the roasted chicken (of three to four pounds) on its 
side. Stick your fork into the leg and lift it up, meanwhile holding down 
firmly the rest of the chicken. Then cut through the joint on the back; 
pressing the joint between the leg and second joint, cut through. 
Stick your fork into the wing so as not to interfere with the knife; cut 
through the joint and loosen the meat surrounding it; pull down with the 
fork and press firmly on the carcass with the knife. If done carefully, you 
can pull all the meat from the breast with the wing. Then cut each breast, 
crosswise, In half. Turn around, and proceed as in the first operation. 

Turkey. Cut away the leg the same as with a chicken. The leg of a 
turkey being larger than that of a chicken, it would be advisable to cut 
into slices the leg and second joint. After the leg is cut off, stick your 
fork into the breast-bone; hold the fork firmly with the left hand; then, 
with the sharpknife in your right hand, starting from the outside of the 
breast, proceed to cut, carefully, thin slices, until you reach the bone. 
Then turn, and proceed the same as before. 

Serve each person with a piece of the dark and a slice of the white meat. 

Should the turkey be stuffed, place a little of the stuffing on each plate. 
A capon, large chicken, or English pheasant should be carved the same way. 
. Partridges. In America only the breasts of the birds are generally 
eaten, the legs being strong and bitter. Stick your fork straight into the 
breast-bone; cut one slice from the outside breast; then cut close along- 
side of the breast-bone and around the wing, carefully pushing all the meat 
from off both breasts, one after the other. 

Grouse. The grouse is generally carved the same way as the partridge. 

Canvas-back Duck. The " King of Birds." The breast only is 
carved, served, and eaten. Stick the fork straight and firmly into the 
middle of the breast-bone. Commence from the neck down to the back, 
straight to the back-bone, and around the back; then from the point of 
starting, around the collar-bone. Cut the joint from off the wing. Com- 
mence cutting again from the point of starting; carefully and gently 
carving off the whole breast, so that no meat remains. Proceed precisely 
the same with the other side. When finished, there will remain only the 



394 THE TABLE. 



Red-head, black-head, mallard, teal, &c. , are carved the same as the 
canvas-back. 

Tame duck, duckling, goose, &c., are carved as a chicken, unless they 
are over four or five pounds, then they should be carved the same as a 
turkey or a capon. 

For small birds, such as squab, snipe, plover, woodcock, &c., no carv- 
ing is necessary, as they are generally served whole. 

Saddle of Mutton, Lamb, or Venison should always be carved 
especially for private families lengthwise first, on both sides of the spinal 
bone, then crosswise downward. Special care should be taken to stick 
the fork right in the centre of the saddle, and holding it firmly while carv- 
ing with a very sharp knife, and keeping as near the bone as possible, till 
down to the end on both sides. When all detached, cut it crosswise into 
small pieces of about half or three-quarters of an inch thick, and serve. 

Steak. Sirloin steak can be carved in various ways crosswise, 
lengthwise, in small or large pieces, as desired. 

When serving, the cut part should always be laid uppermost. I would 
suggest, though, carving it diagonally into six fine, even slices, till you 
reach the fat part. When carved this way it makes it look inviting, and 
has a beautiful effect. Always place a small piece of the fat on each plate 
when serving. 

Tenderloin, or Fillet. Fillet is carved straight, in as many pieces as 
desired, but when serving, the cut part should always be served the same 
as the sirloin, uppermost. 

Roast Beef. As soon as the rib-beef is roasted to perfection, as men- 
tioned in No. 527, remove it from the hot oven, place it always on a hot 
dish, with the rib-bones downward ; should it be crusty on top, cut off 
just a little from the surface, which is generally so hard that often it is an 
impediment in cutting the slices to the desired perfection. Stick in the 
fork-tines lengthwise, on top of the roast, near the edge, in a slanting 
manner, so as to avoid pricking the lean part of the roast and the result- 
ing loss of juice or blood; hold firmly the fork with the left hand, and with 
a large, sharp knife in the right hand, carefully cut, in even, small slices 
a quarter of an inch thick, right down to the rib-bones; gen.tly make a 
cut underneath, so as to have each slice separate from one another; 
then serve. 

Roasted Leg of Mutton. If practicable, when carving a leg of mutton 
a patent handle should be adjusted to the end bone, which would be a sub- 
stitute for the fork, and an avoidance of soiling the hands at the same time. 
Begin carving small, thin, even slices, about quarter of an inch in thick- 
ness, straight or diagonally down to the bone, till you come to the end 
bone, then lengthwise underneath to the end. On account of the much 
thinner meat on the other side of the leg, carve it diagonally, and serve 
one piece from each side. 

Roasted Leg of Lamb. Is to be carved exactly the same as the leg 
of mutton.

CURIOUS MENUS OF VARIOUS NATIONS. 413 



M E N U 



THROUGH the courtesy of a gentleman who has for many years lived 
in Central Africa, and who has brought with him a young prince, son of 
one of the powerful chiefs of the Baaili tribe, to be educated in this 
country, the author is enabled to illustrate the habits and customs now in 
vogue in the Royal Kitchen there. 

As a rule, there is only one principal meal, which is eaten in the early 
part of the evening. It mostly consists of parrot-soup, roasted or stewed 
monkeys, alligator eggs (also well liked by Europeans), and birds of every 
description. They also have moambo or palm-chops, and fish. A great 
delicacy, so considered by Europeans and natives alike, is elephant's 
feet and trunk. They have somewhat the taste of veal, and have a very 
delicious flavor. To prepare them they dig a hole, about five feet deep, 
in the sand, and build in it a large fire. After the sand is thoroughly 
heated, the fire is removed, leaving only the ashes in the hole. They 
place the trunk and feet in this hole, covering them with leaves, and 
afterward with hot sand; they remain there about two hours, when they 
are considered done. 

* All carcasses of animals which are to be cooked, are placed on a block 
of wood, and pounded until every bone Is broken, care being taken not to 
tear or bruise the skin. They are then boiled or roasted on an open wood- 
fire, in hot sand or ashes, without removing the hide or feathers. 

The cooking is of a very inferior grade; the only spices used being 
salt and pepper. 

The kitchen utensils consist of common earthen or wooden ware. 

Very little time is taken for setting or decorating the table; knives, 
forks, napkins, &c., &c. , are dispensed with. 

All victuals are served in large wooden vessels. After the members of 
the chief's household and his guests have assembled, each person is sup- 
plied with a wooden spoon, and selects whatever he wishes out of the 
different vessels, using his hands in eating it. 

In the line of vegetables, they have also several dishes well liked by 
Europeans. N'gutti-N'sengo is a dish eaten all over Africa. It consists 
of egg-plant, small fish, somewhat like our sardines (N'sengo), and the 
roots of the cassava or manioca plant (called N'gutti), which have a 
knotty appearance, and often weigh as much as twenty pounds. 

As the latter contains poison, they soak the manioca in water for three 
to four days, to extract the poisonous substance. They are cut and 



414 THE TABLE. 



sliced, adding small tomatoes. All is placed in a vessel with water, and 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and boiled. Moambo,or, as the Europeans 
call it, palm-chops, is also a favorite dish. The palm-nuts are first boiled 
in water, until the pulpy substance loosens from the pit. 

Then the shell, which contains a very delicious oil, is placed in a 
wooden mortar and crushed to obtain the oil. Then whatever the meal 
consists of, meat, fish, mussels, &c., all is put in a vessel, adding the oil 
and the pulpy part of the palm-nut, also red pepper and salt, and is boiled. 

Roast or boiled squash (Loenge) is generally eaten with it. 

Sweet potatoes (M'balla Benga) are more farinaceous, and sweeter than 
ours, but do not taste so good. They are boiled or roasted in the same 
way as we do here. 

Bananas (Bitaebe) weigh about a half pound each, and are about fifteen 
inches long. When half ripe they are cut in slices, adding much salt and 
pepper, and are boiled in water. 

N'sensi is a little red bean, which is boiled in water without adding salt 
or pepper. 

Peanut bread (Chisulu): the peanuts are first roasted, then crushed. 
This mass is then rolled and put into the skin of a banana, adding a little 
pressure, forming it into a body. It readily retains this shape from the 
presence of the oily substance in the peanut.

As to the Chinese, at their formal dinners or feasts no menus are 
used. The bill of fare consists of an interminable list of dishes, and 
which has been arranged by the author in the form of a menu card. The 
tables are laden with such dishes as shark-fins, beche-de-mer fish, fish- 
soup, chicken-soup, duck-soup, rice, rice, rice, and tea, tea, tea, and tea ; 
not forgetting the edible birds' nests, candies, and cakes. One's appetite 
is almost taken away on entering a Chinese house at which a banquet is 
to be given the effect of burning incense and other vile herbs. The 
Chinese can be extremely polite. Champagne is a favorite drink among 
Chinese officials at the Treaty Ports, and is always brought out when 
they have a foreign guest.

A most delicious sauce, called "Shoyu," which is the basis of Wor- 
cestershire sauce, is also used to give spice to the food. Throughout 
the repast the guests are served from time to time with " Saki," a pale 
liquor made from rice, and which tastes very much like sherry. It is 
served hot, and is a most insinuating tipple. In a large party you. are 
expected to exchange cups and drink with every one present. The result 
is that, in nine cases out of ten, you leave the house just a " wee bit fu'," 
as they say in Scotland. Like the Chinese, no knives, forks, or napkins 
are used " chop sticks" only. To smack your lips or belch during the 
feast is, strange to say of such a supremely polite people, not considered 
bad form.

In Corea Chinese fashions are very closely followed. Greasy messes

The food is always conveyed to the mouth by the aid of " chop sticks," 
and during the progress of a meal the mind becomes catered to by an 
animated conversation.

Among the Kanakas, the food eaten for breakfast, luncheon, and dinner 
is about the same, and consists chiefly of the native dish called " POI," 
which is eaten whenever they (the Kanakas) are hungry. 

"POI" is made from a root called " Taro" and in shape and size 
resembles a raw beet, it has a dark skin, and the vegetable itself has a 
variety of colors pink, gray, purple, and white. 

The " Taro" is cooked in the ground, after the manner of a " New 
England clam-bake;" after obtaining the softness of a cooked potato it is 
peeled, and beaten with a large stone or iron, made, for that purpose, into 
a pulp. It is then mixed with water until it forms the thickness of paste 
(and which makes very good paste, as it is often used for sticking bills, 
etc., when a theatrical company arrives), and after standing for a few 
days, to allow it to ferment, it is ready to be eaten. 

The " Poi " is always eaten out of a "Calabash" (a large gourd 
about the size of a pumpkin), the natives always eating with their fingers, 
this being done by sticking the two fore-fingers into the "Calabash," 
giving it one or two twists, and dexterously turning it around in front of 
their. ..faces, until it looks like a ball of "taffy on a stick" (no pun 
intended). 

" Taro " is sometimes cooked and eaten like potatoes and is consid- 
ered very wholesome food. 

The next important dish is "Raw Fish" which are caught along the 
coast and eagerly eaten by the natives. Fish is also cooked in the 
ground, and is served on large leaves about the size of palm-leaves, 
called " Ti " leaves. Raw meat, raw liver, and a fragrant sea-weed form 
delicate side-dishes. . . , 

Coffee, within the last few years, has to a great extent been drunk as 
a beverage, but not so much as the Hawaiian tea, which tastes and smells 
like medicine. '' 

Vegetables are also eaten, but sparingly, comprising sweet potatoes, 
Irish potatoes, cabbages, etc. 

Fruit, the product of the Islands, is very much eaten and relished, 
such as guavas, mangoes, bananas, mountain-apples, oranges, etc. 

The Hawaiians when eating always sit on mats. All eat out of the 
same calabash. After eating, it is the custom to pass the pipe of friend- 
ship, which is a small pipe made from shades teeth.

THE TABLE. 



THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE. 



THE pleasures of the table are enjoyed by all who possess good health. 
Nothing is more fascinating than to be seated at a well-served, well- 
cooked breakfast or dinner; and yet, of the immense number that 
enjoy the good cheer and luxuries of the table, how few, very few, 
there are who stop to consider the vexatious trouble our host undergoes 
when arranging the daily bill of fare. "Variety is the spice of life,"' 
but nowhere is it more important, aye, actually necessary, than in the 
getting up of a palatable meal. This pertains not only to the dining-room 
of a hotel of the least pretensions or to the so-called " grand" restaurant, 
but particularly to the family table. The writer has known a. gentle- 
man who presided over an immense restaurant, and daily provided the 
supplies therefor. He experienced no difficulty with any single part of 
his. business, yet when he came to arrange the details of his own family's 
meals, and attempted to practically fulfill them, he was puzzled and 
annoyed beyond description. And, after all, there is no place in the civil- 
ized world where the market for the supply of food is so well provided 
as in New York, both as to variety and excellence, and even as to luxu- 
ries. Educated as thousands of persons have been, in the art of dining, 
by the famous Delmonico and his able lieutenants. New York, perhaps, 
contains a larger number of so-called high-livers than any other city, i 

These "gourmands" (if you please), and their number is legion, have, 
with the aid of the excellent resources of the American market and the 
encouragement given to the culinary art of the period, brought the modern 
American table to virtual perfection. This is saying a great deal, inas- 
much as the famed restaurants of London, Paris, and Vienna have ever 
claimed a reputation and an ascendancy over others that seemed to form 
a part of history itself. 

But as times change, so we change with them. Westward the course 
of Empire sways, and the great glory of the past has departed from those

centres where the culinary art at one time defied all rivals. The sceptre 
of supremacy has passed into the hands of the great metropolis of the 
New World. It has been the writer's good fortune to gain experience on 
this subject from his observations in Europe as well as in this country. 
He can state, without fear of contradiction,' that more first-class, well-fatted, 
and corn-fed cattle reach the markets of New York, than any other market 
, of the United States. Whenever a first-class article of beef is required by 
one of the inland hotels, they send to New York for it. 

Ask the ordinary travelei-, and he wijl tell you that a first-class steak, 
an "A T " chop, or prjme roast beef is a rara avis in hotels outside 
of New York. London has excellent mutton and good beef; that is all. 
Paris gives plenty of variety, but it is all of an inferior quality with the 
exception of veal, which is good. The same may be said of northern 
Germany, where, in addition, the larger hotels in Hamburg and Bremen 
are able to supply good steaks, the cattle in that country being of fine 
quality. 

Yet no American, accustomed to his prime beef at New York, can be 
pleased at any of these continental hotels, as he loses sight of his favorite 
roast and steak. 

At the extensive cattle yards of Berlin, which are under control of an 
excellent administration, and perfectly arranged, it was impossible, for 
instance, on a well-supplied market day to find a single dozen corn-fed 
young steers that would make good enough beef for first-class custom in 
New York. The bulk of cattle offered for sale was made ' up of oxen 
that had been overworked — they had horns bigger than themselves — ^and 
the remainder were old cows and bulls. 

Of the bovine family, the branch most celebrated for the good quality 
of beef is the Durhams or Shorthorns. It is only fifty years ago that 
the first were imported to this country from England, and so well have 
they prospered and multiplied that the finest and best specimens of the 
race are now found in these United States. They are now freely exported, 
at large prices, to, the mother-country, where they are highly prized for 
breeding purposes. There are farms in Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, 
and even in Missouri and Kansas, that turn out annually from 300 to 1,000 
head of fatted, corn-fed cattle, from two to four years old, and weighing 
from 1,500 to 2,500 pounds per head. , 

As to mutton, this country is already beginning to occupy aU)osition 
second to none. We may probably not as yet surpass Englandun this 
respect, but we have learned a great deal on this subject during the past 
thirty years; hence the American breed of sheep has considerably 
improved. The quality and flavor of our mutton is improving to Uhat 
extent that a long time cannot possibly elapse before the prejudice now 
existing in favor of the English article must give way to the honisst 
acknowledgment that the American mutton, if not superior to, stands dt 
least fully on a par with, the English rival. \ 

Our farmers and agriculturists have learned a great deal on this ques- 
tion. They now know that, as to early lambs, for instance, the ewes 



THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE. 



should be strong, and kept in good condition, so that they can supply the 
lambs with plenty of milk. They are now kept in a warm barn where the 
cold winds do not touch them, and where the sun can shine on them. 
They commence feeding them by putting a little bran in the lamb's mouth, 
so that it can taste it, and the lambs commence eating from a box 
separate from the sheep. They generally feed them with cracked corn or 
meal, and sometimes oats and corn ground together, with plenty of milk 
from the ewes. If kept in good order and well fed, they will be ready 
for market by the' time they are six to eight weeks old. After the month 
of June, lambs come from New York State — mostly from Dutchess County. 
They are turned out to graze on the hills, where some cracked corn and 
meal are put in the fields, so they can eat it at their pleasure. Many of 
the late sheep and lambs come from Canada. Two of the largest sheep 
ever sold in New York were raised by Mr. Vail, of Dutchess County, and 
sold by A. Luyster to Mr. L. Delmonico for the sum of $ioo. The 
two weighed, alive, 632 lbs., and dressed, 420 lbs. 

One of the leading questions that directly affects the American cuisine 
is the contest now progressing as to the transportation of animal food to 
the great Eastern markets. Heretofore live cattle were transported to, 
and slaughtered at, the places of consumption. This so - called home- 
slaughtering interest has within the past few years experienced great 
competition with the slaughterers of cattle in the far West, who have 
brought their meats to the Eastern market in refrigerator-cars. The 
great question now is: Which is the better way, and by which method are 
the public interests served the best, as well as the sanitary condition of 
this important article of food most improved ? 

There can be no doubt that, while this controversy lasts, the consumer 
has already been benefited, and the transportation of live cattle has already 
been greatly facilitated and improved. The quality of the meat does not 
depend upon the place where the animal is slaughtered, but it does depend 
upon the state of the animal's health when it is slaughtered. Let the 
cattle-cars be improved so that cattle can be transported without being 
knocked about and bruised, and let them be properly fed and watered 
while in transit; after making the long journey from the far West, let 
them be well rested and cooled off before slaughtering. 

The Western dressed-beef men will also have to be on their mettle in 
order to meet the exigencies of the times. Let them keep their wild 
prairie cattle and their scalawags out of the better markets, handle their 
beef carefully, keep it subjected to a uniform temperature of about 38° 
Fahrenheit, discard all artificial preservative means, and all opponents to 
their interests will be bereft of argument. 



THE TABLE. 



OUR MARKETS. 



OUR markets contain an abundant supply of poultry and game of an 
exceptionally fine quality. For superior and palatable chickens 
We are recommended to those raised about the creameries of New 
Jersey. The hand-fed geese and ducks of Rhode Island rival in flavor 
and delicacy the . celebrated Caneton-de-Rouen, while the American tur- 
keys are famous the world over. To give any adequate idea of the quan- 
tity of game which comes from the vast feeding-grounds of this country, 
or to enumerate substantially every form in which, during the different 
seasons, game appears in market, would require too much space. 

No game is more highly prized or more eagerly sought after in Europe 
than our American canvas-back ducks, grouse and wild turkeys. It has 
become part of our history that during the late war twenty thousand 
turkeys were shipped by one firm in New York City to supply a Thanks- 
giving dinner to an army ; while at present so plentiful is the supply that 
but a few days would be required to secure double that number. 

Niear Rhode Island, on one farm of about fifty acres, twenty thou- 
sand geese, and as many ducks, are fattened annually for market. In 
Vermont and other cold localities during December, when turkeys are 
full grown and fattest, hundreds of tons of them are dressed, frozen hard 
in boxes, and preserved in that condition for use in the spring and sum- 
mer months; when freshly killed, turkeys are tough and unpalatable. 
Unless well experienced, the purchaser would do better to leave the 
selection of poultry and game to some reliable dealer, rather than depend 
upon " signs," which are at times deceiving. 

Spring chickens appear in market about May ; those hatched in incu- 
bators come somewhat earlier. They are very small, weighing about a 
pound each, and improve in flavor and richness as they increase in size. 
Tender chickens may be had almost the whole year, but they are not 
plentiful during the spring months. 

Capons are good from December until April. 

Young turkeys are first killed in September ; they are full grown and 
fattest in December, and remain good until spring, when they are super- 
seded by frozen turkeys. 

Geese and ducks are first brought to market in June, and, if they have 
been properly fed, are a great delicacy. They may be had through the 
summer, autumn, and winter months. Geese are called "green" until 
they are three or four months old. 

Guinea-fowls are best in summer and autumn, when young and fat. 

Squabs are in market the whole year. 



OUR MARKETS. 



The laws for killing and selling game vary somewhat in the different 
States, and sometimes in the different counties of the same State. Refer- 
ence is made principally in regard to the New York City markets. So 
great are the facilities for forwarding quickly by rail and steamer, that 
supplies of game are easily obtained from long distances ; and birds killed 
in southern Texas, or other remote places, may be served perfectly fresh 
on New York tables a few days later. The flight of birds is greatly 
controlled by the weather. An early or late season, or a wet or dry one, 
or even a cold wave, may hasten or retard them, and make game plentiful 
or scarce, fat or poor ; but an abundant supply of all kinds of game in its 
best condition is generally to be had in the months it is in season, as 
follows : 

Ruffed grouse, commonly called partridges, are in season from Sep- 
tember I to February i. 

Pinnated grouse, commonly called prairie-chickens, from September 
I to February i. 

Quails, from November i to February i. 

Woodcock are in the market from August t to February i, and are 
fattest in October. 

English snipe appear in the spring, and again in the autumn, when they 
are in their best condition, and are to be had in smaller quantities during 
the winter. 

Yellow-legged snipe, robin or red-breasted snipe, dowicher and black- 
breasted or winter snipe, also common snipe, are abundant in the spring, 
and again from July through October, when they are best. 

Upland, grass, or gray plover are in market through the spring and 
summer months, and are fattest in August and September, 

Doe-birds are to be had at about the same time. They are plover of a 
larger size, and are con^dered not inferior to any other. 

Golden plover, or frost-birds, are plentiful in the spring, and are in fine 
condition in September and October. 

Sora, or Virginia rail, are best in September and October. 

Reed-birds, or rice-birds, become very fat in August and September. 
When found among the reeds of New Jersey they are called reed-birds, 
and rice-birds when from the wild rice-fields of the South. 

Rabbits and hares are in season from November i to February i. 

Venison is in market from August i to January i only, and is good 
during that time. 

Antelope may be generally had through the autumn and winter 
months. 

Wild pigeons appear in the spring and autumn, but no longer in such 
immense numbers as formerly. It is only possible to obtain them for 
market when their " nestings " are near a railroad, which facilitates -their 
quick shipment. The young birds (wild squabs), taken from the nest, 
make a most delicious broil. 

Wild ducks, swan, geese, and brant are in season from September i 
to May I, The choicest of these are : canvas-back, mallard, teal, red- 



THE TABLE. 



head, widgeon, wood, brant, cygnet or young swan, goose when young 
and fat. 

English pheasants, English hares, and Scotch grouse are to be found 
in the New York markets in excellent condition during the winter months. 

The wild mongrel goose, which appears in our markets about Christ- 
mas-time, is, like the canvas-back duck, considered as one of the greatest 
luxuries, and exclusively American. 

The far-famed canvas-back du ck is also an exclusively North American 
species. Closely resembling in appearance and habits the red-head of 
America and the pochard of Europe, it is still quite distinct from and 
superior to both these species in the excellence of its flesh. It is found 
throughout North America, from the Arctic Ocean to Central America, on 
the interior waters and on both shores. Chesapeake Bay is the most 
noted ground for canvas-back ducks in the country, but they are espe- 
cially abundant in Southern California. They breed on the ponds, rivers, 
and lakes, from Oregon to the more extreme northern portions of the con- 
tinent. The canvas-back is without doubt the most sought after and 
widely known of all our ducks, and in localities where it can obtain the 
root of the Vallisneria spiralis (called by some tape-grass, and by others, 
incorrectly, wild celery), the food to which it owes the peculiarly delicate 
flavor for which it is so famous. As a highly prized delicacy, it stands 
without a rival. When, howevqr, it is obliged to content itself with a diet 
chiefly of animal food, or is not properly handled in the kitchen, it becomes 
merely a very ordinary table bird. The Vallisneria is not found on the 
Pacific Coast, but in many parts of the interior, and especially in the 
Chesapeake Bay. The canvas-back being an excellent and strong diver, 
brings from the bottom the Vallisneria by the roots ; these it bites off and 
swallows,while the red-head, black-head, and other ducks feed on the refuse 
grass, or occasionally a root snatched from the canvas-back. At times 
the water is covered with grass thus pulled up. By the middle of Decem- 
ber the canvas-back becomes so fat as to have been known to burst open . 
in the breast' in falling on the water. In New Orleans it is called ' ' canard 
cheval." The canvas-back is covered somewhat like the red-head, but 
there is no reason for the confusion which exists in the minds of so many 
people regarding the two species. A careful comparison of the following 
descriptions of the two birds will indicate well-marked differences by 
which they may always be distinguished. The cook of a Buffalo gentler 
man, when asked if she knew the difference between a red-head and a 
canvas-back replied, "To be sure! one has the head of a fool!" (meaning 
the canvas-back).

The red-head duck is found in greater or less numbers throughout 
North America, on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, breeding in high north- 
ern latitudes, and frequenting in winter the southern portions of the con- 
tinent as far as Mexico. The red-head is not common on the coasts of 
New England. During the winter months it abounds considerably along 
the south shore of Long Island, and is extremely abundant from this 
point south, especially at Chesapeake Bay and Currituck. Its flesh is 
excellent, and when it is enabled to feed on the well-known Vallisneria is 
almost fully equal in point of flavor to that of the canvas-back. The diet 
of the red-head is by preference vegetable, but in default of a sufficiency 
of food of this nature, they will, like other ducks, eat frogs, tadpoles, and 
various mollusks. In the West they feed largely on corn and wheat, 
which they glean from the fields, and on wild oats, the seed of the water- 
lily, and roots and leaves of other aquatic plants. 



THE TABLE. 



VARIETIES OF FISH TO BE FOUND IN 

THE MARKETS DURING THE 

DIFFERENT MONTHS. 



JANUARY. 



Live codfish \Gadus morrhua\. Haddock \Melamogramus agle finus\. 
Cusk \Brosmius brosme\ ; this belongs to the cod family, and although 
very little known, is an excellent table fish. Hake \Phycis chuss\ ; this is 
another of the codfish family, but inferior to any of the other varieties. 
Halibut \Hypoglossus ■vulgaris\. Small chicken halibut \Hypoglossus vul- 
garis]. Striped bass [^Roccus lineatus\. Eels [Arguilla ■vulghris\. Lobsters 
[ffomarus Americanus]; very scarce, and in poor condition. Fresh salmon 
[OiicorAync&us chouicha\ ; these salmon are caught in the Columbia River, 
Oregon, all the year round, and are shipped in refrigerator-cars, and 
received daily in the New York markets. Frozen salmon [Salmo salar]; 
caught in the Restigouche River in July, and kept in freezers. Turbot 
\Platysomatichthys hifpoglossoides\, coming from Newfoundland, are occa- 
sionally in market during this month. Frost-fish, sometimes called tom- 
cods \Microgdus tomcod\. Frozen fresh mackerel \Scomber scomirus]. 
Frozen Spanish-mackerel [Scomber omarus\. Pompano [Trachynottis caro- 
linus] ; a few 'occasionally in market, coming from Pensacola, Florida. 
Red-fish, or channel bass [Sciosna ocellata], caught in Florida. Sheep's-head 
[Diplodus' fobatocephalus\, from Florida. Gxouf&x \Epinephelus morio], 
from Pensacola ; a very good fish for boiling, somewhat like the red- 
snapper, but the meat is of a finer grain. Red-snapper {^Luijanus Black- 
fordi{\ has become a staple article in our markets during the winter. 
They weigh from two pounds upward, as much as twenty pounds each. 
It is good either boiled or baked, but most epicures prefer it baked. In 
selecting a fish, care should be taken not to buy one that weighs over eight 
pounds, as anything larger than that is apt to be tough and lacking in 
flavor. Shad \Clupea sopidisimd], caught in the St. John's River, in Florida, 
are to be had nearly every day during this month. Frozen bluefish 
[Pomatomus saltatrix], preserved by being kept in freezers since the pre- 
vious fall. Herring [C/upea harengus], from Nova Scotia. Skate, or ray- 
fish [Plerroplatea maclurd]. The demand for this fish increases every year. 
The American people begin to appreciate its many excellences. Probably 
the annual dinners of the Ichthyophagous Club, at which this fish is 
always served, have materially increased the popularity and demand for 
this fish. Rainbow trout [^Salmo irrided]. These fish were first marketed 
during the winter of 1885 and 1886, and they are one of the notable exam- 



VARIETIES OF FISH. 



pies of fish-culture, as the following brief history will show. Six years 
ago Professor Spencer F. Baird, then Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries 
for the United States, received a lot of eggs of the rainbow trout from 
California. He presented five hundred of them to the South Side Club, 
who have one of the most complete fish-cultural establishments in this 
State. These eggs were hatched and the fish raised in the preserves of 
the Club, where they increased to such an extent that the Club decided to 
send their surplus to market, and they have become very popular, and 
sell readily at one dollar and twenty-five cents per pound. The open 
season for these trout is from April to September. Salmon-trout, frozen 
\Salvelinus namaycusK\. Whitefish, frozen \Coregonus clupeiformis]. Pick- 
erel [Esox reticulatus], weighing from half k pound to ten pounds each, 
are very good during the winter months. Wall-eyed pike \Sticostedium 
■vitreum\. Catfish \Ictalurus punctatus\. Smelts \^Osmerus mordax] are 
received from dififerent parts of. the East and North during this month. 
The choicest come from Maine and Massachusetts. Those coming from 
Canada are always frozen, and are inferior, and sold at a very low price. 
Green turtle. Diamond-back terrapin. Prawns, from South Carolina. 
Scallops. Oysters. The following are the best in this month : Blue 
Points, Shrewsburys, East Rivers, and Mill Ponds. Hard crabs. Crab- 
meat, fresh picked. Whitebait. Finnan haddie. Smoked salmon. 
Smoked halibut. Best boneless dried codfish. 

FEBRUARY. 

Live codfish. Haddock. Halibut. Striped bass. Eels. Live lob-

perch [Hoccus Americanus], from Long Island ; one of the best pan-fish 
that is found in market. Smelts, green, from Maine, Massachusetts, and 
Rhode Island, and frozen smelts from Canada. During the latter part of 
the month very choice smelts are received from Long Island. These fish 
are large, and are considered the best of all varieties of smelts received. 
Shad. During the latter part of the month they begin to come from North 
Carolina. These fish are oftentimes large, weighing six pounds each, and 
in flavor are equal to those taken in the Connecticut River. Herring. 
Skate, or ray-fish. Salmon-trout. Whitefish. Yellow perch [Ferca Amer- 
icana], Pickerel. Wall-eyed pike. Catfish. Green turtle. Terrapin. 
Prawns. Scallops. Oysters. Codfish tongues. Soft shell crabs during 
this month are in excellent condition, and are considered one of the most 
seasonable shell fish in market at this time. Hard crabs. Whitebait. 
Crab-meat, fresh picked. Finnan haddie. Smoked salmon. Boneless 
dried codfish. Smoked halibut. 

MARCH. 
Live codfish. Haddock. Halibut. Striped bass. Chicken Halibut. 
Eels. Live lobsters. Salmon, from the Columbia River. During the 



lO THE TABLE. 



latter part of the month a few fish are received from Nova Scotia, weigh- 
ing about eight pounds each, and are called Kennebec salmon by the 
tradesmen, although no salmon are caught either in the Penobscot or 
Kennebec rivers, Maine, until about the ist of May. Large flounders 
\Pseudopleuronectes Americanus], suitable for making fillet of sole. Spanish- 
mackerel. Pompano. Sheep's-head. Red-snapper. Grouper. Shad are

Whitefish. Yellow perch. Pickerel. Cisco[Coregonus artedi]. Catfish. Wall- 
eyed pike. Green turtle. Terrapin. With the month of March closes the 
terrapin season, as after the ist of April it seems to be univerally con- 
ceded that the weather is too warm, and terrapin are not relished, nor 
does the palate crave them. Soft shell clams are still excellent this month. 
Prawns. Scallops. Oysters. Those known as East Rivers, caught on 
the north shore of Long Island, are considered best in this month. Crab- 
meat, fresh picked. Smoked haddock. Smoked salmon. Smoked halibut. 
Smoked mackerel.

Live codfish. Haddock. Halibut. Striped bass. Chicken halibut. 
Eels. Live lobsters. Tomcods. Salmon, fresh from the Columbia River. 
Salmon, fresh from Nova Scotia. Flounders. White perch. Fresh mack-

our coast, oftentimes in enormous numbers,, and are sold in the markets 
at prices so low as to make them the cheapest food of the season. Span- 
ish-mackerel and pompano are occasionally in the market from Pensacola, 
Florida. Kingfish [Menticirrus nebulosus] ; a few come into market from 
North Carolina. Sheep's-head, from North Carolina. Smelts ; with the 
close of this month the fish goes out of season. Red-snapper are to be

tacus flumatilus\ are found during this month in the markets ; they are 
caught in the Potomac River. Scallops ; with the close of this month 
they are out of season. Oysters are generally better during the month of 
April than at any other time of the year, but, according to custom, with 
the close of this month the oyster season ends. Fresh frogs' legs during 
the latter part of this month are taken, and begin to make their appear- 
ance in market at prices of about sixty to seventy-five cents per pound. 
Codfish tongues. Hard crabs. Crab-meiat. Whitebait. Smoked had- 
dock. Smoked salmon. Smoked halibut. 



VARIETIES OF FISH. I I 



MAY. 

Codfish during this month is apt to be poor, as no live fish are 
brought to the New York markets. It is mostly fish caught off Nan- 
tucket and repacked in Boston, and from there shipped to New York. 
Haddock ; the same applies to this fish as to the cod. Halibut is 
in excellent condition this month, both large fish for steaks, and small 
chicken halibut for dinner fish. Striped bass. Eels. Lobsters. Black- 
fish \Teutogo onitis\. Salmon from Restigouche make their appear- 
ance about the 2oth of May. Oregon salmon continue to come during 
this month, although not in as good order as in previous months. 
Large flounders for fillet of gole are excellent this month. Fresh mack- 
erel. Spanish-mackerel and pompano from Pensacola, Florida. A few 
come to market from North Carolina during this month. Butter-fish 
\Stromateus triacanthus\ make their appearance in the market this month. 
Weakfish \Cyono5cion regale\ plenty and cheap. Kingfish from Long 
Island make their appearance during this month in the markets, and are 
an excellent fish, growing better each month till October, when they go 
out of season. Sheep's-head ; a few make their appearace from Long 
Island. Porgies \_Stenotom.us chrysops^ from Long Island. Sea bass during 
this month are abundant from Narragansett Bay. Shad from Connecticut 
is probably at its best this month. There is no doubt that shad from 
this river possesses a flavor superior to all others. Shad from the North 
River begin to get soft and are not in good condition. Bluefish ; there are a 
few weighing one and a half to two pounds each in market. Squid \Loligo 
peal(zi\ This is an article of food that Spaniards and Italians think a great 
deal of, but it is very little used by American people as yet. It has been 
introduced to the American public by the dinners of the Ichthyophagous 
Club, which is composed of a few gentlemen connected with the leading 
newspapers, and some eminent scientific men, whose object is to cultivate 
a taste and demand for those varieties of fish which are not generally sup- 
posed to be good edible food. Brook-trout under the existing law come 
into market on April i. Probably the finest flavored trout found on 
this continent are the wild brook-trout taken in the streams of Long 
Island. Cultivated brook-trout that are raised in ponds and preserves 
depend very much upon the character of their food as to what the flavor 
will be. Trout that are fed entirely upon chopped liver are usually flat 
and insipid to the taste. But trout that are fed upon small minnows or 
other fish-food, such as clams, larvae of insects, and small fish of any 
kind, are always more delicate in flavor. Salmon-trout and whitefish ; a 
few are found in market this month, but during warm weather it is very 
difficult to obtain them in New York City markets in prime condition. 
Carp \Cyprinus carpia]. These fish are now making their appearance in 
our markets in considerable quantities, having been introduced into this 
country through the instrumentality of Professor Spencer F. Baird, late 
United States Fish and Fisheries Commissioner, some eight years ago. 



12 THE TABLE. 



They have been distributed in nearly every State of the Union, and in the 
Southern States have grown larger, and are found in better condition, than 
they are in Germany, where the parent fish came from. The market is 
principally supplied now with fish caught in the Potomac River, weighing 
from two to fifteen pounds each, and are selling at present for twenty-five 
cents a pound ; but in the course of a few years there is no doubt that 
these fish will be sold for from ten to twelve cents a pound. Green turtle. 
Frogs' legs. Crayfish during this month come from Wisconsin. They 
are of very fine flavor, and are the best that are found in this country. 
Prawns from South Carolina. Crab-meat, fresh picked. Soft crabs grow 
more abundant during this month, and are in excellent condition. A very 
choice smoked fish is in season this month, called the roe herring, and by 
some of the grocers Under various names,, such as bloaters, Burlington 
herring, etc. 

JUNE.

but not in good condition. Halibut. Striped Bass. Eels. Lobsters. 
Fresh salmon from the Kennebec and Penobscot rivers, Maine, and from

oftentimes as low as fifteen cents per pound by the whole fish. Large 
flounders for fillet of sole. Blackfish. Fresh mackerel. Pompano. Span- 
ish-mackerel. Weakfish. Butter-fish. Kingfish. Sheep's-head. Porgies.

larger, sometimes weighing four to six pounds each, and are improving in 
quality. Carp. Skate, or ray-fish. Black bass \Micropterus dolomiet\ are 
in season from the ist of June until the ist of January. This is a very 
choice table fish; probably one of the best of the fresh water fishes.

a very inferior fish as compared with the Spanish-maclcerel. Crevalle 
\Caranx hippos\. This fish is sometimes sold as pompano, but is a very 
inferior fish, as the pompano is one of the choicest fishes that we have in 
market. Butter-fish. Tilefish \Lopholatilus chavtaeleonticeps\. This fish 
was first discovered in our waters by the United States Fish Commission 
in i88o. It is very brilliant in color, but the meat is very coarse-flaked, 
and somewhat resembling the haddock in appearance and flavor. Lafa- 
yette [Liostomtts xanthurus], a small fish weighing about a quarter of a 
pound each, and a very desirable pan-fish. Sea-robins \Prionotus palmipes\. 
This fish is found very plentifully at this season of the year in the waters

VEGETABLES. 



15 



VEGETABLES. 



VEGETABLES are grown to such an extent in the South, and also in 
hot-houses in the North, that we may enjoy, even in the coldest 
winter weather, nearly every variety. 

The growing of vegetables in the South for Northern markets received 
its impetus through an incident which happened in a then well-known 
resort in New York. A party of gentlemen, among them a steward on 
one of the Southern steamers, were seated one day in January con- 
versing, when the steward, who was in the habit of bringing mint with him 
for this particular resort, ordered a mint-julep; this order, at that time of 
the year, created a little surprise, especially to one of the party, who was 
a dealer in vegetables. However, the matter was explained, and the 
dealer arranged with the steward to bring him some mint, together with 
whatever vegetables he could get, on each of his Northern trips. The 
demand for them increased so fast that a great many growers commenced 
to raise vegetables, so that the business has grown to vast proportions. 

The following information may be useful to those who wish to know 
at what season of the year certain vegetables may be had, and also where 
they may be had in their prime. 

Asparagus. The consumption of asparagus has grown so much dur- 
ing the past few years, partly, perhaps, through the recommendation of 
physicians, that it might be well here to give an idea as to where and 
when it is grown. It first makes its appearance in market from the 
middle of February until the middle of March, according to the condition 
of the weather. 

Occasionally it may be had during the winter from hot-houses, but of 
inferior quality. The first of out-door growth comes from Charleston, 
S. C, where there are a number of very large beds, and where it is grown 
very successfully, both as to quality and quantity. It is shipped from 
there to Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, and New York, arriving at 
the latter place by express in a little less than forty-eight hours after 
cutting. Although North Carolina is growing more every year, the next 
location where it is raised in quantities for market is Norfolk, Va. , the quality 
being of the best. We now reach our own vicinity — Oyster Bay and New 
Jersey. , The former place has long had the reputation of raising the finest 
asparagus, but as a great many of their beds are getting old, and not 
receiving the proper attention, they are fast losing their prestige to 
Jersey, where they are growing more and more every year, and of the 
very finest quality. Asparagus may be had at its best from the ist of 
May, until the ist of June; after this time it commences to run out until 
July first, when cutting is stopped. The demand has been so great for 



1 6 THE TABLE. 



the past few years that, although more and more is raised every year, the 
price advances instead of getting less, and for the large "Colossal" or 
" Delmonico " asparagus immense prices are paid. 

French artichokes may be had all the year round; the quality and 
size depend on the condition of the weather during their growth. Most 
of the supply is from France, but occasionally from California and the 
South. 

Jerusalem artichokes appear from the ist of October until June; they 
are always good. 

String beans can be had from the middle of February until December; 
they are in their prime during the spring and fall months. Occasionally 
we receive them in December and January from Havana, but they are not 
first-class. 

Lima beans, which are seldom shipped from the South, can be had 
from August until frost sets in; they are always good. 

Beets all the year round; best jn spring and summer. 

Cabbage all the year round; always good. The first new cabbage 
comes from Florida in March. During the winter large quantities of 
cabbages are imported from Denmark. 

Carrots all the year; the small young ones appearing in the spring. 

Chives can be had all the year round. 

Cucumbers all the year round. In the winter we get them from the 
hot-houses around Boston; they are of the very finest quality, although 
rather expensive. 

Cauliflower all the year round; we have them in January, February, 
and March from England and France, and in April and May from the hot- 
houses on Long Island. They are of fine quality at all seasons except 
during summer. 

Celery may be had in every month but May and June, but is best 
during the cold weather. It is being extensively raised in Kalamazoo, 
Mich. , for the past three or four years ; and as they raise it much earlier 
than we, and of good quality, it will not be long before we have it all 
the year round. 

Chervil may be had all the year round, but is usually poor during 
warm weather. 

Chicory we have from August until March;, best during fall and winter 
months; occasionally during February and March; a fine quality comes 
from France. 

■ Com or winter salad (called by the French doucette, and by the Gernians 
fetticux) from September until warm weather sets in. It is purely, as its 
name indicates, a winter salad, as it never grows in the summer. 

Cress all the year round; best in the spring. 

Dandelion from January i to June. 

Escarolle salad from August until March. 

Egg-plant all the year round ; scarce during winter.. 

Garlic all the year round; in large quantities for the past two or three 
years during May, June, and July, from New Orleans. 



VEGETABLES. 1 7 



Herbs, such as thyme, sage, sweet basil, borage, dill, lavender, 
sweet-fennel, sweet- marjoram, rosemary, summer-savory, tansy, etc., 
may be had green in the summer and fall, and dry during the balance 
of the year. 

Kohl-rabi from May until November.' 

Knot celery from September until May. 

Leeks all the year round. 

Lettuce can be had all the year round. In the winter it comes from 
the hot-houses of Boston, Providence, Long Island, and Jersey, but princi- 
pally from Providence, as that city for the past few years, has made a 
business of growing lettuce for the New York market. It is best in the 
fall and spring. It is almost impossible to grow good lettuce in the 
summer, for, should it head at all, the warm weather would rot it. 

Mint can be had nearly all the year round; scarce during December 
and January. 

Mushrooms can be had all the year round ; they are raised principally 
in cellars and hot-houses on Long Island, and the demand for them 
increases yearly. The people are gradually getting over the fear they 
>once had of the poisonous toad-stools, of which, by the way, there is no 
danger now, as the mushrooms are carefully picked and sent to market 
by men who understand the business. They are scarce during the very 
warm weather. 

Oyster-plant can be had from September until June. 

Okra appears all the year round; in the winter and spring it comes 
from Havana. 

Parsley all the year round. 

Onions may be had all the year round. 

Green peppers all the year round. In winter we get them from 
Havana. 

Potatoes all the year round. There need be but little fear of a potato- 
famine. During the past few years, when our own crop has been light, 
large quantities were imported from England, Ireland, Scotland, and 
Germany. The first new potatoes come from Bermuda about April i. 

Sweet potatoes from August until June. 

Peas from March until November. 

Parsnips from September until June. 

Pumpkins from September until February. 

Roraaine salad can be had in the spring and fall. 

Radishes all the year round; they are very scarce in hot weather. 

Rhubarb from February until July. 

Brussels-sprouts from October until April. We import the very 
finest from France during March and April, but our growers are improv- 
ing in raising them from year to year, and we hope before long to rival the 
French. 

Kale-sprouts from November until June. 

Shallots all the year round. They are green in spring and summer 
and can be had dry during winter. 
2 



1 8 THE TABLE. 



Spinach all the year round; it is covered up in the early winter to 
keep it from freezing, but occasionally during extreme cold weather the 
cold reaches it, when it is impossible to cut it, which makes it scarce and 
high in the markets. 

Sorrel can be had all the year round'; it is raised mostly by French 
gardeners. 

White and yellow summer-squash from April until October. 

Marrow-squash all the year round, except May and part of June; 
they are used quite generally to make pies instead of pumpkins. 

Tomatoes can be had all the year round, except December and part 
of January. The first new ones come from Key West; they are of 
excellent quality. 

White and ruta-baga turnips can be had all the year round. 

Estragon appears from March until December. 



WATER-MELONS AND MUSK-MELONS. 



WATER-MELONS first make their appearance in market about the 
first of July, and can be had until the middle of October. Un- 
like the musk-melon, they are of a rather hardy nature, and 
after the melon has grown on the vine, the changes in temperature, or rain, 
have little effect on them. The first in market come from Florida, and as 
the season advances we get them from further North, until New Jersey is 
reached. More melons are raised in Georgia than in any other State, and of 
far better quality. The best variety to be relied on, as to quality, is known 
as the " Gem." 

Musk-melons, although raised in nearly all parts of the country where 
the climate will admit, are seldom shipped to New York from any distance 
further than Ndrth Carolina, a^ a musk-melon, in order to be of good fla- 
vor, must be ripened, or nearly so, on the vine. When ripe they are 
so easily cracked or mashed that they would not stand transportation. 
For the past two or three years, a few, of a rather hard-rind variety, but 
of excellent flavor, have been shipped from New Orleans, but with only 
partial success, as the cost of transportation and the loss are so great that 
it hardly pays. We often hear the remark, " I have not eaten a good 
melon this season.'' This can be easily explained. 

A melon is of a very sensitive nature, and the delicious'flavor is destroyed 
by rain or cold weather. A melon-patch from which we get finehf flavored 
melons to-day, may be ruined (as to flavor) for a few days, by a heavy 
rain-storm ; for the melon absorbs water like a sponge. When we have 
hot nights and no rain, we have perfect melons. Invariably, it is during 
this kind of weather that tbey are most appreciated. Melons fifst appear 
about the middle of July, and last until cold weather.

HOW TO SET A TABLE. 



To set a table seems, perhaps, very easy, but to set it properly and 
tastily is not such an easy matter. The advice herewith given may 
prove advantageous to many. 
Place the table in the centre of the dining-room, undfer the chandelier, 
and see to it that it is perfectly steady ; that is to say, that there is no

danger of its being shaken while the dinner is in progress. Should it not 
rest firmly, perhaps an old relic, in the shape of a Bland Dollar, could be 
made serviceable by placing it under one of the feet. See to it that 
there is plenty of space between each cover ; it is annoying to come in 
contact with every move of your neighbor. 

A table for six persons should be six feet long. Take a woolen cloth 
and put it over the table, and then place a linen cloth on top of it ; this 
■will deaden the noise of plates and glasses. 

Flowers should never be absent from the table when you have guests ; 
they can be procured at all seasons. A large basket or bouquet should be 
placed in the centre of the table ; a large bouquet on the right side for 
each lady, and a small boutonnUre for each gentleman, also on the right 
side of the cover. 



20 THE TABLE. 

On each side of the centre-piece place a fruit-stand, nicely arranged 
with the choicest fruits of the season. Next to this place a compotier with 
assorted cakes. Place celery, olives, or radishes symmetrically in the 
space that is left between the centre and the covers. Fish-knives, soup- 
spoons, and oyster-forks must be placed on the right side of the plate, 
and the fork on the left side. If desired, place fancy pieces on the table, 
(^eces monUes); but as the foregoing items pertain only to a dinner for six 
persons it would crowd out much available space. The diagram on the 
preceding page will illustrate the arrangement of the glasses on the table. 

Napkins can be arranged in various styles and figures ; into flowers or 
any other desired form. The latest and most fashionable way is to arrange 
them folded plainly, so as to show the monogram of the family. A small 
salt-cellar should be placed at each cover, to avoid asking the servant for it. 

Menus, either printed or written, should be placed at each cover. It 
is not a breach of etiquette to refuse a course you do not desire ; by know- 
ing what is coming, you can with propriety refuse a course, and take the 
next one. 

About ten minutes before commencing dinner, fill the decanters with 
Sauterne and with sherry, and place the same on the table, as in diagram, 
marked Cand D, 



HOW TO SERVE MEALS. 



NEARLY every family of means is in the habit of giving a few dinners 
to its friends during the year. As a matter of course, the mem- 
bers of the family are, in return, invited to "dine out." 

If you invite your friends to a dinner, you should not wish them to 
go away dissatisfied. After a varied experience of many years, both in 
this country and in Europe, the author feels that no apologias are neces- 
sary if he endeavors to enlighten our epicures and dinner-givers as to how 
to arrange and serve a fine dinner, from commencement to close, after the 
manner of the French. 

It should not be forgotten that much depends upon the appearance of 
the table , and the manner of serving the courses. In fact, more success 
can be attained by studied attention to the room, the table, and the serv- 
ing of the courses, than in the preparation of costly viands. 

On entering a dining-room, the first object which strikes the eye is the 
table. If the table is void of flowers, and other side decorations, includ- 
ing olives, radishes, and celery, tastefully arranged napkins and wine- 
glasses, an impression is given of a boarding-house table. On the contrary, 
when you see a beautifully decorated and artistically arranged table, the 
heart is immediately gladdened. 

A proper regard should be given to the comfort of the guests as 
regards temperature. Have the room neither too cold nor too warm; the 



HOW TO SERVE MEALS. 21 

temperature should never exceed sixty degrees. The dining-room should 
be well aired before dinner commences. Great dare should be taken that 
the dinner be served very hot. Noises with plates and glasses should 
be avoided. 

There is as much system in serving a fine dinner as there is in running 
a railroad, or in any other business. French dinners are generally served 
in three main co\iX%&s,\\T., Relevh, Entries, axA Rotis ; all the rest are 
considered side courses. It depends entirely on the taste of the host as 
to how many main courses he desires served. The author would suggest 
two relevis, three entries, and one or two rotis; this could be made an 
elaborate dinner. 

Naturally, what you shall serve will depend entirely on what there is 
in market at the season. For instance, you cannot serve brook-trout 
in January, or canvas-back duck during the months of June, July, August, 
or September. However, the very best in the market should invariably 
be selected. 

Care should be taken to have the wines at the right temperature. 
Sherry, Sauterne, Chablis, and Rhine wmes should always be served cold. 
Champagne should be served very cold, almost at the freezing-point. 
Bordeaux and Burgundy should be kept twelve hours before dinner in a 
room at a temperature of seventy degrees. Servants should be instructed 
not to fill the glasses more than three-fourths full; for guests are in dan- 
ger of soiling their dresses, and, again, it is not considered good form.

necessary instructions how to serve it:

2 2 THE TABLE. 



To begin with the oysters or clams: place some finely chopped ice on 
each soup-plate, with a small fancy napkin on top. Arrange the oysters 
or clams nicely on top of each plate, with a piece of lemon, and serve. 
With this course serve also Haut Sauterne, It is understood that the 
oysters or clams are to be served after all the guests are seated. It should 
be made a rule never to remove any plates while some of the guests are 
still eating. When all have finished, remove the oyster-plates and leave 
dinner-plates in their stead ; then serve the soup. The servant is expected 
to present a plate of each ki<d to each guest, and ask which is preferred. 
Serve sherry with the soup. Always serve the plates on the right side, 
and remove on the left. Serve timbales. First put a spoonful of sauce 
on each plate, and then the timbale ; at the same time you are serving the 
timbale, remove the cold plates and serve the fish. Put the fish on the 
plates, then the sauce, with a few potatoes on the same plate. Serve 
Rauenthaler-Berg. Remove the plates and serve fillet of beef, which 
should be cut in small, even slices. Put the sauce on the plate, and then 
the fillet. Place the artichokes on^the same plate. Serve Pommery Sec 
with this and with the other course. Remove the plates and serve saddle 
of mutton. Cut the loin of the saddle lengthwise, and then crosswise, 
and serve with a little gravy and a spoonful of string-beans on the same 
plate. When this course is finished, serve the sweetbread^. Put the 
sauce first on the plate, as with the fillfet, with a spoonful of peas. With 
this serve Chateau Latour. The next course, terrapin, should be served 
in a very hot tureen. Before serving, add a little fine sherry; mix well, 
and give each guest a small portion. Serve more Chateau Latour with ■ 
this course. , 

After this comes sorbet. This can be served in glasses or in shells; 
for instance, take six lemons or six small oranges, cut off the tops, take 
the soft parts out of them, and in them place the sorbet. Arrange them 
on cold dessert-plates, decorated with 'small fancy napkins or fancy paper. 
While the guests are enjoying the sorbet, remove sherry, Sauterne, and 
Hock glasses, no matter if empty or full. (Replace knives and forks 
before serving the sorbet.) ' 

Now come canvas-back ducks. _ Before serving, place them for a 
moment before the host, so that all the guests can see them. Cut off only 
the breasts, and serve, with a little of the gravy and a small piece of fried 
hominy, on very hot plates; then pass around the currant jelly. You can 
serve a whole breast or a half one; however, during a hearty dinner, a 
half one is preferable; this is entirely at the disposition of the host. Serve 
celery salad with mayonnaise dressing on separate dessert-plates, with 
forks, and then serve Chambertin. 

When this course is finished, remove all side dishes, casters, and salt 
and pepper cruets, and leave nothing on the table but flowers, fruits, and 
cakes. Clean the table neatly with a brush or napkin, and then place 
dessert spoons and forks at each cover. Serve plum pudding the same as 
omelette au rum. Pour the rum over the pudding, spread powdered 
sugar on top, and, with a spoon, keep pouring the burning liquid over it 



ffOW TO SERVE MEALS. 23 

*- 

until it ceases to burn. Then cut in slices and serve, putting some of the 
liquid on each plate. 

Vanilla and pistache ice-cream should be served on cold dessert-plates 
vfith fancy paper underneath, and with dessert spoons and forks. Serve 
the cakes with the ice-cream. 

When this course is finished, serve to each guest a finger-bowl, with a 
thin slice of lemon in the water. Small cups for coffee should be passed 
at the same time. Fruits, nuts, and raisins come next. It is customary 
with some old American families to introduce at this course a bottle of 
very old Madeira wine; but this is certainly not necessary. 

Now comes the last, the coffee, which must be served fresh and very 
hot, for the preparation of which the author refers you to page 381. At 
the same time serve cordialsi and' the dinner will be completed. 



Menus for Every Day in the Year. 



EXPLANATORY NOTE. 

While these menus are biinple and complete, it is not supposed that they can always be 
carried out in detail. They will, however, furnish suggesuons to house-keepers who are daily 
perplexed with the question, "What shall we have for break&st, luncheon, and dinner?" The 
number placed after each dish refers to the recipe showing how the dish is prepared. The 
menus are arranged so as to be iise(^foi any year. New Year's, 1890, will begin on a Wednes- 
day instead of a Tuesday, as here printed; in that case, use the New Year's menu and then turn 
to the first Thursday in January and proceed in regular order. Should you come out uneven 
at the end of the month, through skipping some days at the first, turn back again 10 the begin- 
ning. For instance should Thursday be the 29th ofjanuary, instead of the last, as punted, turn 
back to the first Friday in January, and proceed until the month is completed. Special menus 
have been prepared for New Year's Day, Washuigton's Birthday, Fourth of July , Thanksgiving 
Day, and Christmas.

minutes. Remove them, drain well, and serve on a hot dish with a folded 
napkin. Any desired garnishing may be added. 

279. Croquettes of Macaroni. — Boil a quarter of a pound of Italian 
macaroni in salted water for twenty-five minutes. Drain, and put it in a 
saucepan with a good ounce of butter, half an ounce of Parmesan cheese, 
and a quarter of an ounce of cooked, smoked tongue cut into small pieces, 
and one truffle cut the same.' Toss all together, then change it to a well- 
buttered sautoire, spreading the preparation one inch thick on the bottom. 
Cover with a buttered paper, press it well down, and put away to cool. 
Cut the preparation with a plain paste-cutter into six parts ; roll each one 
in grated Parmesan cheese, dip in beaten egg, and roll in grated, fresh, 
white bread-crumbs. Fry in very hot fat for four minutes, drain well, 
and serve on a hot dish with a folded napkin. 

280. Anchovies on Toast. — Prepare with American bread six dry 
toasts, spread over them a little anchovy butter (No. 146), and cover each 
with four half anchovies. Place the toasts on -a. tin baking-sheet in the 
oven for one minute. Arrange them on a dish with a folded napkin, and 
serve. 

281. Caviare on Toast. — Prepare six toasts of American bread. Put 
half the contents of a small box of Russian caviare into a sautoire ; add 
two tablespoonfuls of cream, and heat one and a half minutes on the 
stove, stirring it carefully meanwhile ; pour this over the toasts, and 
serve on a dish with a folded napkin. 

282. Tlion Marine. — Fold a napkin on a radish-dish, and dress on it 
the desired quantity of Thon Marin6 — -pickled tunny. Decorate with a 
little fresh parsley, and serve as a hors-d ceuvre. 

283. Sardines k I'Huile. — Lift the sardines carefully out of the box

drain them on a cloth, then dress them artistically on a radish-dish. 
Decorate with a hashed, hard-boiled egg and some chopped parsley. 



HORS VCEUVRES. 



igr 



285. Norwegfian Anchories. — These are considered far superior to 
the bottled anchovies. On taking them out of the keg they should be 
placed in cold, fresh water for two hours, then drained, and with the 
hand split in two along the backbone. Lay them in a small bowl and 
cover with sweet oil, and use as desired. 

286. Saucisson de Lyon. — Procure a medium-sized, fine saucisson 
de Lyon, cut twelve very thin slices from it, dress nicely upon a radish- 
dish, and place a few parsley-leaves in the centre. 

287. Mortadella. — To be served the same as the above (No. 286). 

288. Tomatoes, side dish. — Take six fine, firm, red tomatoes, wipe 
well, then plunge them into boiling water for one minute, drain and 
peel them. Put them in a cool place, and when thoroughly cold, cut 
them into slices, arrange them on a radish-dish, sprinkle a little salt, 
pepper, and vinegar over. 

289. Cncnmbers, side disll. — Take two medium-sized, fine cacum- 
bers, peel neatly, and cut them in thin slices. Place in a bowl with a 
good pinch of salt, and put them in a cold place for two hours. Then 
drain the liquid off, and season with half a pinch of pepper, a tablespoon- 
ful of vinegar, and the same quantity of oil. Dress nicely in a radish- 
dish. 

290. Celery, in glass. — Procure a bunch of fine, white Kalamazoo 
celery, pare off the green stalks, and trim the roots neatly. Be careful to 
save the clear, white hearts. Cut each plant lengthwise into four equal 
branches. Wash them well in cold water, and put them into clean water 
with a piece of ice until ready to serve ; then arrange them nicely in a 
celery glass, or dress on a china radish-dish, with a few pieces of ice in 
the centre. 

291. Celery, frizzled. — Another and economical way to prepare celery 
for a side dish to decorate the table. Take only one large head of fine 
celery. Pare off the green stalks, and cut off the root (reserving it for 
a delicious and wholesome salad). Cut the stalk lengthwise into four 
equal branches. Wash them well in cold water, then cut each one 
into pieces about as long as one's finger ; by so doing, all the branches 
will be separated. With the aid of a small, keen knife pare the thin 
sides a little, making five or six slits in each piece, starting from the top, 
downwards, leaving half to three - quarters of an inch uncut ; place 
them in cold water with plenty of ice, leaving them in for two hours. 
Lift it from the ice-water, artistically dress on a round glass dish, and 
send to the table. Celery arranged and served in this way makes a beauti- 
ful effect on the table, but requires a little patience in its preparation. 

292. Radishes, how to prepare. — If the radishes be quite large, take 
three bunches — ^if small, four bunches — being careful to select them 
round, firm, and the reddest procurable. Pare off all the leaves and 
stems except the two prettiest on each radish. Cut away the roots, and 
also a little of the peel around the roots. With a small, sharp knife 
divide the remaining peel into five or six equal-sized leaves, beginning 
at the root end, and cutting toward the green stems, but being careful to 



192 



THE TABLE. 



avoid detaching the leaves. They can be formed into any desired design 
by cutting thera with care. Place them in cold water until required. 
When serving, arrange the radishes artistically on a flat saucer, the 
radishes meeting toward the centre, the green leaves lying outward. 
Serve with chopped ice over them. 

298. Eemarks Regarding Badishes. — The following incident hap- 
pened in my presence over twenty-five years ago. One evening, dinner was 
served to a party of prominent gentlemen in Lyons, France, among whom 
were Alexander Dumas, pfere, the great novelist, and Berger, the famous 
billiard player. While the waiter was in the act of handing the radishes 
to M. Dumas, he saw a change come over him ; anger was depicted in 
his face, and he thoroughly expected to see the radishes, radish-dish, etc., 
flung full at him. He stood amazed, not daring to question the dis- 
tinguished guest. When his anger subsided, he amiably explained 
that the cause of his sudden ill-temper was offering to him radishes 
peeled, and deprived of their green stalks; he asserted that the healthiest 
and best parts had been removed. After inquiries of more experienced 
co-Hborers, the waiter thoroughly agreed with M. Dumas, and experi- 
ence has taught him the correctness of his judgment. 

Radishes are a luxurious and healthful adjunct to the dinner-table, and 
can be procured almost the whole year ; but in the spring the markets 
are more plentifully supplied, and that is the most wholesome season to 
partake of them. 

294. Welsh Rarebit. — Take one pound of American cheese ; cut up 
in small pieces. Place them in a sautoire, adding half a glassful of good ale. 
Season with half a saltspoonful of red pepper. Stir it continually with 
a wooden spoon until the mass is well melted, which will take about ten 
minutes. Have six nice, fresh, large pieces of toast ; arrange them on a 
very hot dish, and distribute the preparation equally over, serving the 
rarebit very hot. 

295. (jtOlden Buck. — Proceed as for the above (No. 294), and when 
ready to serve, dress a poached egg (No. 404) on each piece of toast, and 
serve very hot. 

296. (jiherkin Buck. — Prepared the same as Golden Buck (No. 295), 
only adding to each toast a slice of broiled bacon (No. 754), and sending 
to the table very hot. 

297. Welsh Rarebit au Gratin. — Prepare six toasts of American 
bread ; broil them lightly, remove, and cover each with a slice of Swiss 
cheese a little less than half an inch thick ; lay thetn in a roasting-pan, 
sprinkling a very little pepper over. Put in the oven for ten minutes. 
Arrange the toasts on a very hot dish, and sepd to the table. 

A pinch of salt represents 205 grains, or a tablespoonful. 
Half a pindh of pepper represents 38 grains, or a teaspoonful. 
A third of a pinch of nutmeg represents 13 grains, or half a tea- 
spoonful.

298. How to Serre Oysters for Private Families.— Oysters should 
be kept in a very cold place before they are opened, and well washed 
before using, otherwise their appearance will be destroyed. They should, 
according to the French custom, be opened on the deep shell, so as to 
better preserve the liquor, then laid on finely chopped ice for a short time 
— too long destroys their flavor. While they should be kept as cold as 
possible, they should never be allowed to freeze, therefore they must only 
be opened shortly before they are needed ; for once frozen, they quickly 
turn sour. The proper way to open them is to place the deep shell in 
the palm of the left hand, and break them on one side. The Boston stab- 
bing-knife is preferable for this, but if there be none handy use a small 
block that the oyster can fit inf.o, and stab it on the edge ; or even a chop- 
ping-block and chopping-knife may be employed in case of necessity. 
Serve six oysters for each person, nicely arranged on oyster-plates with 
quarters of lemon. 

299. Oysters k I'Alexandre Dumas.— Place in a sauce-bowl a heaped 
teaspoonful of salt, three-quarters of a teaspoonful of very finely crushed 
white pepper, one medium-sized, fine, sound, well-peeled, and very finely 
chopped shallot, one heaped teaspoonful of very finely chopped chives, 
and half a teaspoonful of parsley, also very finely chopped up. Mix lightly 
together, then pour in a light teaspoonful of olive oil, six drops of Tabasco 
sauce, one saltspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, and lastly one light gill, 
or five and a half tablespoonfuls, of good vinegar. Mix it thoroughly with 
a spoon ; send to the table, and with a teaspoon pour a little of the sauce 
over each oyster just before eating them. 

300. How to serve Clams. — Clams should be served on deep plates, 
covered previously with finely chopped ice. To have them sweet and 
fresh, they should be kept as cold as possible. Serve six on each plate

bread-crumbs, and fry in very hot fat. 

3. For certain fish, like whitebait.'immerse them in milk, then in flour

on a hot dish with a folded napkin, nicely decorate with parsley-greens all 
around the salmon, and serve with a pint of hot oyster sauce (No. 173)

strain the broth into a sautoire, reduce it to one-half, and add to the gar-, 
nish with a regence garnishing (No. 235) ; glaze the top of the fish with

roll it over again as before, and tightly tie both ends exactly as before. 
Lay it in a fiat tin pan, placing on top of it a board the size of the boned 
turkey, and on top of it a weight of seven pounds, leaving the weight on 
until the galantine is thoroughly cold, which will take a whole night ; but

the table, make a hollow in the centre, and pour into it half a pound oi 
well-washed butter, a saltspoonful of salt, and a gill of cold water. Knead 
well the salt, buttei:, and water, using the hand, for two minutes, then 
incorporate the flour gradually, which will' take three minutes more, and 
knead sharply with the hands. Detach it from the table, and roll it into 
a ball, then press it again on the table in different directions for two 
minutes; remove again from the table. Flour the table slightly, lay the 
paste over, and with the fingers of the right hand press down the paste in 
the centre, and with the left bring up the edges all around to the centre, 
repeat this three times, and when finished the paste must have its original 
shape ; lay it on a dish, cover with a towel, and set it in a. cool place to

1079. How to Make a Pastry-bag, for General Use. — Cut a piece of 
white duck-cloth as follows: twenty-four inches wide at the top, twenty 
inches deep, and three inches at the lower end. Fold, and sew up length- 
wise, so as to make a perfect cornet-bag. Hem the top and the bottom, 
and the pastry bag will then be ready for use. 

The accompanying design will show how it should be made. 




PASTRY-BAG. 



This pastry-bag is essential and useful for kitchen and pastry use, being 
both facile and economical, but care must be taken to wash it thoroughly, 
and immediately after using it, and to let it dry perfectly, otherwise it 
will soon become useless. 

1080. How to Clean and Prepare Sultana Currants and Raisins for 
Pastry. — To avoid the trouble of preparing them each time they .are 
needed, it were better to clean many at a time, for they will keep in 
perfect condition for five or six months, if put away in a well-closed , tin 
box. Procure ten pounds of currants or Sultana raisins, lay them on a 
table, and should they be damp, dredge a little fiour over to prevent them 
adhering to the hands. Rub them thoroughly, then take a wire sieve, 
No. 3 (or as fine a one as will prevent them passing through), place the 



DESSEJiTS. 3ig 



currants on it, and shake them well for two or three minutes, so that they 
be perfectly free from flour and stalks. Lay the sieve containing the 
currants in a large dish-pan, filling it to the level of the sieve with hot 
water, then, with a skimmer, stir them, so that they get washed thoroughly 
for at least five minutes. Lift up the sieve, and let them drain in the 
same for three minutes. Cover an iron oven-pan with a sheet of brown 

■ paper, pour the currants on it, spreading them out evenly, and set it in a 
very slow oven for ten minutes; remove, and lay them aside in the warm- 
est spot on the kitchen shelf, and leave them to dry thoroughly for at least 
two-days. If in the country, the pan can be left out in the sun during the 
day. When dry, lay them on the table, and should any more foreign 
matter be found among them, pick it out carefully with the fingers, and 
examine thera well to see whether they be free of stones, stalks, stems, 
sand, &c. When finished, put them away in a closed tin box, and they 
will then be ready for use. 

lOSl. How to Clean Malag'a Raisins. — Have as many Malaga raisins 
as deemed necessary, but it were better to purchase five pounds at a 
time. Lay the raisins on a table, have a bowl of cold water on the right 
hand, antf the raisins in front ; pick off the dry stalks adhering to them, 
then, either using a small knife or the fingers, pick out the seeds, taking 
care to wet the fingers in the bowl of water, so as to prevent them stick- 
ing while seeding them. Close up again, giving them their original form; 
when finished, put them in a tin can, cover well, and place in a moderate 
temperature for use when required. Raisins prepared in this way will 
surely keep six months.

and leaving an inch space clear around the edge of the plate ; take the 
remaining five ounces of paste, roll it out round-shaped, the same as 
before, fold it in two, and, with a knife, make incisions in the centre, of half 
an inch each. Moisten lightly the edge of the plate with a little beaten 
egg, then cover with the paste, pressing down with the hand all around- 

. the edge, so as to inclose the preparation entirely, then moisten the surface 
slightly with the beaten egg. Place in a moderate oven, and let bake for 
fifty minutes; remove it to the oven-door, sprinkle plenty of powdered

the mold in a square tin pan, filling it to half its height with hot water, 
then place in a moderate oven for one hour. Remove it from the pan, 
lay a dessert-dish over the mold, unmold, and decorate the top with fanci- 
ful designs of red-currant jelly (No. 1326); serve it hot with a sauce-bowl- 
ful of the following sauce (No. 1165).

of powdered sugar, mix briskly with the pastry-whip for two minutes, 
then add one and a half pints of cold milk, and a teaspoonful of lemon 
essence; then mix well again for one minute, strafn this through a sieve 
into another vessel. Butter and sugar well six small molds as for maras- 
chino pudding (No. 1134), fill them one inch high with caramel (No. 1252), 
let cool off for five minutes, then pour in the preparation, dividing it 
equally; place them in a tin pan filled to half the height of the molds with 
warm but not boiling water, put in a moderate oven, and let steam for 
forty minutes. Take them out, turn them on a hot dessert-dish, and 
serve in their own sauce. This pudding may be prepared in cups instead 
of molds. 

1167. Apple Charlotte. — Select four large or six medium-sized New- 
town pippins. Peel, core, and cut them into quarters. Put them into a 
saucepan with two ounces of fresh butter and four ounces of powdered 
sugar, and place on a moderate fire. Toss them for two minutes, then

purpose, and sprinkle powdered sugar lightly over. Let each slice over- 
lap slightly until the bottom is covered. Then line the sides to the edge 
in the same way. Fill the mold with the prepared apples, and cover 
with slices of bread. Lay it on a baking-pan, and place it in a brisk oven 
for forty-five minutes, or until the bread be a good golden color. Then 
take it out, lay a hot dessert-dish on top, turn it over, and remove the 
mold. Heat in a saucepan two ounces of apricot nlarmalade with two 
tablespoonfuls of maraschino and one of water. Mix well, pour it over 
the charlotte, and serve very hot. 

116$. Small Apple Charlottes. — Prepare and cook the apples the 
same as for No. 1167, and when removed from the fire, put it aside to cool. 
Trim the crust off of a quarter of a loaf of stale American bread. Cut it 
into slices the thickness of a silver dollar. Butter and sugar well six 
small, round pudding-molds. Shape the slices of bread carefully, to line 
the insides. Butter them lightly ; place them in a clean baking-pan, and 
leave in the oven for five minutes to get a brown color. Remove them; 
let them cool a little, and then line the molds with them. Fill in with 
the apples, and lay the full molds on a baking-pan in the oven for twenty 
minutes. Turn the charlottes out on a dessert-dish. Heat half a pint of 
raspberry juice in a saucepan, pour it over them, and serve hot.

water, and let cook for twelve minutesi Place the cooked apples in a 
square tin pan, pour the boiled rice over them, and put into a moderate 
oven for ten minutes. Then have a hot , dessert-dish ready, and with a 
tinned cake-turner dress them carefully on the dish, decorating the sides 
with the rice. Should a pyramidal shape be desired, place three apples 
in the centre, two on top of these, and the last one above them all, then 
fill up the empty space around them with the rice, and serve with half a 
pint of vanilla syrup in a separate sauce-bowl. 

The sauce is made thus : put two pounds of granulated sugar into a 
saucepan with one quart of cold water, and set it on the hot stove. Stir 
well for two minutes ; add two vanilla-beans split in halves, and boil for 
ten minutes longer. Remove from the fire ; strain through a sieve into 
another vessel, and use when required. This syrup, when cold, may be 
poured into bottles, and if corked tightly and put away in a cool place, 
will keep in good condition for a month at least.

and let it cool off for thirty miniltes. Add the yolks of two eggs. Beat 
the whites to a froth in a basin with a wire whip, and add them to the 
rice. Sweeten with three ounces of powdered sugar and flavor with a 
teaspoonful of orange-flower water. Mix well together for five minutes. 
Peel and core four sound Newtown pippin apples, and cut in slices about the 
thickness of a silver dollar. Butter the sides of a saucepan lightly ; then 
cover the bottom with a layer of the prepared rice half an inch thick ; put 
a layer of sliced apples over this, and so dispose of all the apples and rice 
in alternate layers. Put on the lid, and put the saucepan into a moderate 
oven for fifteen minutes. Remove, dress on a hot dish, and serve. 

1173» Biz aa Pommes il la Czar. — Prepare rice and apples as above 
(No. 1172), but before putting into the oven, run a larding needle down 
through it in a dozen places at equal distances, and pour over half a gill 
of Russian kummel. Put on the lid; place in a moderate oven and let 
cook for twenty minutes. Remove, and dress it neatly on a dish, sending 
it to the table with a bowl of sauce 4 la creme (No. 1133), but using two 
tablespoonfuls of the kummel instead of the brandy for flavoring, as 
described in cocoanut pudding (No. 1147). 

1174. Turban of Apples au Biz. — Prepare half a pound of boiled 
rice as for No. 1172. Butter a mold holding three pints. Garnish the 
bottom and sides .with the rice, using a wooden spoon for the pur-

pin apples. Put them into a saucepan with three ounces of pow- 
dered sugar, a gill of cold water, and half a saltspoonful of salt. Place 
the pan on a hot stove, put on the lid, and let cook for ten minutes. 
Remove, and fill the mold with eighteen of the pieces, reserving the other 
six for later use; then put it in a slow oven for twelve minutes. Use an 
ordinary towel to remove it from the oven. Lay a dessert-dish on top, 
turn over, and lift off the mold. Decorate the base with the rest of the 
apples, inclining them slightly; and the top with two ounces of cleaned 
currants (No. 1080). Garnish between the apples with four ounces of 
candied fruits, placing some on top. Pears, angelica, and cherries, all sliced, 
make a pretty effect. Return to the oven for five minutes, and serve.

being careful to avoid breaking the apples. Cover the bottom and, sides 
of the timbale with half a pound of the boiled rice; pour in the apples, 
lay the remainder of the rice on top, and cover with an ounce and a half of 
pie-paste. Put the timbale into a moderate oven, and cook for thirty 
minutes. When the surface is of a good golden color, remove, and put 
aside to cool thoroughly, leaving it at least two hours. Turn it over onto 
a dessert-dish, remove the mold, and lay the timbale in a short, low, wide 
freezer; cover, then put it in a tub of nearly the same size, filling it well 
with chopped ice; sprinkle the top and sides freely with rock salt, and 
freeze thoroughly for an hour and a half. Remove the cover carefully 
to avoid any ice or salt falling into the freezer. Take out the timbale, and 
'wipe well the dish. Have ready one pint of whipped cream (No. 1254) 
with half a gill of maraschino; beat this well for two minutes. Pour it 
over the timbale, and send immediately to the table. Should there be no 
freezer handy, the timbale may be cooled by placing in the ice-box for 
three hours. 

1176. Croustade de Eiz Meringn^e. — On a floured board roll half a 
pound of f euilletage paste (No. 1076) into an oval shape , and a quarter of 
an inch thick. Lay it upside down on an oval dish ten inches long by six

dish, and place the oval paste in a baking-dish; then roll out the pieces 
which were cut away, and with a small fancy paste- cutter (No. i) cut 
it all up. With a small hair pastry-brush dipped in beaten egg, wet the 
edges of the oval, and arrange the pieces all around, crown-shaped. Bake 
this croustade in a moderate oven thirty minutes. Have ready six ounces 
of boiled rice (No. 11^2). Peel and core six medium-sized fine apples. 
Put them into a saucepan with two ounces of powdered sugar, a, gill of 
cold water, and half a saltspoonful of salt. Put on the lid, and let cook 
on a slow fire for twenty minutes. Arrange half the rice on the croustade, 
dress the apples over, and fill up the cavities with the rest of the rice. 
Add to the juice of the apples in the pan two ounces of apricot marma- 
lade (No. 1335). Mix well for two minutes and pour it over the whole. 
Then set it in a slow oven for fifteen minutes. Remove, and beat up two 
eggs as for a meringue (No. 1247), mixing in two ounces of powdered 
sugar. Put this into a pastry-bag (No. 1079), and decorate the surface of 
the croustade artistically with it, sprinkling a little sugar over. Return 
it to the oven for five minutes, to get a good color. Pass a knife gently 
under the croustade, and dexterously slide it from the baking-pan onto a 
hot dessert-dish, and serve.

down in the centre, and with the right bring up the edges all around. 
Continue to repeat this for five minutes. Roll the paste into a ball, put 
it on a dish, cover with a napkin, and set it in a cool place to rest for 
fifteen minutes. Roll it out to the thickness of a fifty-cent piece. With a 
knife cut it into strips two inches wide, and from these, beginning at the 
end of each, shred it with the knife into narrow pieces resembling matches. 
Leave these to dry slightly on a floured board for thirty minutes, and they 
will be ready for use. 

1183. Buckwheat Cakes. — Dilute one drachm of compressed yeast with 
a gill of lukewarm water, and let it rest for ten minutes. Add it to a half 
pound of buckwheat flour in a basin, pouring in a pint of cold water, and 
season with a light pinch of salt. Mix thoroughly with the spatula, cover 
the basin with a cloth, and let rest for four hours. 

Have a griddle large enough to hold six cakes. Grease lightly with a 
piece of fat pork-rind, and place it on a hot stove. Pour half of the batter 
into the six sections of the griddle, distributing it evenly. Bake two and 
a half minutes, turn over and bake two and a half minutes longer. Heap 
them on a hot dessert-dish. Make the other six exactly the same way. 
Send to the table with honey or maple sugar separately. 

1184. Wheat Cakes. — Put into a vessel four ounces of sifted wheat 
flour, half an ounce of powdered sugar, one drachm of compressed yeast.

minutes. Strain through a sieve into another vessel. Place on the stove 
a small griddle, greasing the surface lightly. Drop about two ounces of 
the batter onto the griddle; bake ten seconds; turn it with a cake-turner, 
and bake ten seconds on the other side. See that the cake is a light brown 
color on both sides. Put them on a hot dish, keeping it warm on a corner 
of the range, and proceed to make eleven more with the remainder of the 
batter. Serve very hot, with honey or maple sugar separately. 

1185. Batter for all Kinds of Frying. — Put half a pound of flour into 
a basin. Make a hollow in the centre, and drop into it one egg yolk, half 
a teaspoonful of sweet oil, a tablespoonful of brandy, and a light saltspoon- 
ful of salt. Mix all the ingredients, except the flour, for three minutes, 
using the hand. Then gradually knead in the flour, meanwhile dropping 
in, little by little, one gill of cold water. Mix well, moving in the same 
direction' for five minutes. Then put it into a vessel, cover with a cloth, 
and set aside to rest for three or four hours. When ready to use, beat 
the whites of three eggs to a froth with a pastry-whip, add it to the batter, 
and mix together thoroughly with the spatula for two minutes. It will 
now be ready for use, but should it not all be required, it will keep in a 
cool place. 

1186. French Pancakes. — Sift half a pound of wheat flour into a bowl. 
Break in three whole eggs. Add one ounce of powdered sugar, and mix 
well with the spatula, adding half a pint of cold milk, pouring it in very

DESSERTS. 341 



ounces of the batter, and bake two minutes ; turn over, and bake the 
other side as long. Turn the pancake on a hot dessert-dish, and sprinkle 
over plenty of powdered sugar. Make eleven more out of the remaining 
batter. Serve very hot. 

1187. French Pancakes h la Gelee. — Make the batter exactly the same 
as for No. 1186. When qooked, arrange the pancakes neatly upon a nap 
kin, and spread over each one about a teaspoonful of currant jelly. Poll 
them up nicely, and dress on a hot dessert-dish, sprinkling a. little pow 
dered sugar over. Then, with a red-hot iron, glaze the surface of each cake 
in three different parts ; wipe the sides of the dish nicely, and send to the 
table. 

French pancakes with apple, apricot, plum, pineapple, strawberry, 
raspberry, or peach jelly are to be prepared exactly the same, using differ- 
ent jellies. 

1188. German Pancakes. — Prepare a batter as for French pancakes 
(No. 1186) ; butter an iron pan, one foot in diameter an^ one and a half 
inches deep. Place this on a hot stove, and pour all the batter into it, 
letting it cook for three minutes. Remove to a brisk oven for seven min- 
utes. Take it out, slide the cake carefully on a hot dessert-dish, and send 
it to the table with six pieces of lemon. 

1189. German Pancakes with Apples. — Prepare the batter exactly as 
for No. 1186. Butter the pan as for the above. When the batter has been 
poured in, spread over it evenly, one pint of preserved apples, cut into 
small pieces, and finish cooking exactly as for the plain pancake (No. 11 88). 
When ready, slide it carefully on a hot dessert-dish, sprinkle plentifully 
with powdered sugar, and send to the table very hot, with six pieces of 
lemon separately. 

1190. Batter for Fritters. — Mix a quarter of a pound of sifted flour in 
a small basin, with half a pint of lukewarm water, to which three-quar- 
ters of an ounce of fresh butter has been added. Place in a saucepan, 
which should be tilted on the range so that when the water boils the 
butter can be skimmed off the top. Add, if necessary, a little more water 
to make a soft paste, beating well with a spatula, to keep it free from 
lumps, and of a proper consistence ; it must be gray and compact-looking. 
Add just a little warm water to render the paste soft and diluted, although 
sufficiently thick to cover the objects for which it is intended ; that means, 
it must drop easily from the spoon. Add to this half a pinch of salt and 
two egg-whites ; beat well together for one minute, and use at once. 

1191. Apple Fritters. — Take three medium-sized, fine, sound apples; 
peel and core them neatly. Cut each into six equal round slices. Place 
them in a vessel, pour over a gill of good brandy, add a light saltspoon- 
ful of ground cinnamon, and let all steep for two hours. Strain them 
through a fine sieve, being careful to keep them whole, and saving the 
liquid for further use. Prepare a fritter batter, as for No. 1190, dip each 
slice separately into it, and with a spoon, drop them singly into very hot 
but not boiling lard, being careful to remove them with a skimmer as 
soon as they are of a good golden color. Two minutes will be sufficient 



542 THE TABLE. 



to have them properly done. Then lay them on a. clean cloth, to dry off 
the grease. Arrange a folded napkin on a hot dessert-dish ; arrange the 
fritters on it, and leave it at the oven door for two minutes. Dredge 
about an ounce of powdered sugar over, and serve. 

1192. Fritters Souffles & la Tanille.— Infuse in a saucepan half of a 
vanilla-bean in half a pint of boiling milk, and reduce it to half. Remove 
the vanilla-bean, and put in one ounce of godd butter. Let it come to a 
boil, then add two ounces of sifted flour, and with the spatula stir briskly, 
to form a paste so stiff that it will no longer adhere to the saucepan. 
Remove it to another vessel. Add one ounce of powdered sugar, two 
egg yolks, and half a saltspoonful of salt. Beat the white of one egg to 
a stiff froth, and mix it in with half a spoonful of whipped cream (No. 
1254) ; this will form a consistent paste. Roll it on a floured board, 
besprinkle lightly with flour, and cut out pieces the size of a walnut. 
With a skimmer drop them' into very hot but not boiling fat. Cook 
quickly for three minutes, until they are a fine golden color. Arrange upon 
a folded napkin, and serve with-powdered sugar sifted over. 

1193. Found Cake. — Put in a vessel half a pound of butter, with half 
a pound of powdered sugar. Grate in the rind of half a lemon, and with 
the hand knead well for twenty minutes. Break into a plate five whole 
raw eggs; add gradually and carefully, kneading sharply with the hand 
for ten minutes longer. Now add half a pound of well-sifted flour, mix- 
ing the whole slowly and thoroughly for five minutes more. Butter a 
two-quart, round Cake-mold, and line it with brown paper at the bottom 
and sides. Fill it with the preparation, and put it in a slow oven to bake 
for fully one hour. Remove, and let cool off for about two hours. 
Unmold, detach the paper, and lay it on a pastry wire-grate. Glaze the 
top and sides with a preparation as for vanilla Eclairs (No. 1245). Lay the 
cake on a dessert-dish with a fancy white pape^. Prepare three ounces of 
candied cherries, two ounces of angelica, two ounces of red and the same 
of white pears, both candied; cut the cherries in two, the angelica lozenge- 
shaped, and the pears each in six parts (except one white one, which is 
kept. whole), keeping the fruits all separate. Place the whole pear on top 
of the cake in the centre, stem upward. Then decorate thus : at the base 
of the pear lay two slices of red pear, carefully, one against the other on 
one side. Repeat on the other side, and arrange [in the same way two 
slices of the white pear in the middle of the space on one side, and two 
more slices opposite. Now cover the four empty spaces nearest the pear 
with half a cherry each, and arrange four angelica lozenges in the empty 
place at the end of the layers of pear. Then on ea^ch of the four angelica 
points lay half a cherry. Begin decorating the edge of the cake all around 
in a crown-shape with one angelica lozenge, putting near the point one 
half cherry, then another lozenge, and continue the same all around until 
joined. Arrange the remaining slices of pear in the empty space near the 
border, and it will be ready to send to the table. 

1194. Wedding Cake. — Place in a large bowl one pound of powdered 
Ugar and one pound of well-washed butter. Grate in the rind of two 



DESSEHTS. 343 

lemons; and with the hand knead well for ten minutes. Break in ten 
whole eggs, two at a time, and knead for ten minutes longer. Mix in a 
plate a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, a teaspoonful of ground cloves, 
two of ground allspice, one of mace, and one of grated nutmeg, and add 
these, with half a gill of confectioners' molasses. Mix well for one min- 
ute with the hand. Add one pound of well-sifted flour, stirring for two 
minutes more. Add two pounds of currants, as for No. 1080, two pounds 
of Sultana (No. 1080), two pounds of Malaga raisins (No. 1081), one 
pound of candied citron, finely sliced, one gill of Jamaica rum, and one 
gill of brandy. Mix the whole well together for fifteen minutes — ^using 
both hands, if necessary. Butter the interior of a plain, five-quart, round 
cake-mold. Line the bottom and sides with paper, leaving it an inch and 
a half higher than the edge of the mold. Pour in all the preparation, and 
place it in a very slow oven to bake for five hours. When done, lay it On 
a table, to cool off for four hours. Unmold, detach the paper, and turn 
the cake bottom up on a wire pastry-grate. After ten minutes, glaze it 
with one egg-white which has been beaten in a bowl with four ounces of 
extra fine sugar, using the spatula; use a knife to apply the glazing. 
Now lay the cake in a warm place to dry for two hours. Then beat up 
the white of an egg with four ounces of extra fine sugar for ten minutes, 
and glaze the cake as before, evenly all around, and lay aside for two 
hours more. After it is thoroughly dried, lay it on a round wooden board, 
with a fancy paper over, two inches wider than the board. Procure a 
fancy wedding-bell, with a miniature bride and groom standing under, lay 
it in the centre of the cake, fastening it on with glace royale (No. 1206), 
pressing it through a paper cornet with a fancy tube. Decorate the sur- 
face of the cake with ornaments made of the glace; also a, fancy border 
around the edge and base. Let it dry slightly for two hours, and it is 
ready for use. 

1195. Sponge Cake.— Put into a copper basin half a pound of pow- 
dered sugar. Break in seven whole eggs, and grate in the rind of half a 
lemon. Beat well together with the wire whip for one minute ; then 
place it on a slow fire and heat it slightly, stirring it sharply and continu- 
ally. Take it from the fire, and beat it well until thoroughly cold. Re- 
move the whip, and with a, skimmer mix in carefully and slowly half a 
pound of well-sifted flour; two minutes and a half will be sufficient. But- 
ter the interior of a one-quart, round cake-mold, and line it with paper, 
keeping it an inch and a half higher than the mold. Then fill it with the 
preparation, and bake for one hour and fifteen minutes in a. moderate 
oven. Let it cool thoroughly for two hours; unmold, place it on a pastry 
wire-grate, and glaze it the same as for vanilla Eclairs (No. 1245). Deco- 
rate artistically with a glace royale (No. 1206), arranging it in any desired 
fanciful design. Serve on a dessert-dish covered with a fancy paper. 

1196. Waffles, mth Sugar.— tPut in a vessel three ounces of powdered 
sugar, one pound of flour, three raw eggs, three ounces of melted butter;

waffle-iron hot on both sides, and on a clear fire. Grease with melted 
butter, using a feather for the purpose, and drop into each . of the holes 
two tablespoonfuls of the paste. Bake two minutes on each side, and if 
they have not a good golden color bake one minute longer on each side. 
Heap them as fast as cooked on a hot dessert-dish. When all are done, 
besprinkle plentifully with powdered sugar, and serve very hot. 

1197. Savarin Cakes. — Dissolve two drachms of compressed yeast in 
a gill of lukewarm cream. Add four ounces of sifted flour, knead well 

, for two rninutes, and set in a warm place for five minutes. Sift into 
another vessel six ounces of flour. Make a hollow in the centre, and 
pour into it two ounces of powdered sugar, four eggs, a. gill of lukewarm 
milk, and a saltspoonful of salt. Knead these well for two minutes, but 
do not mix in the fiour. Add three ounces of melted butter and half a 
gill of curajoa (or any other liquor desired), then knead in the flour with 
the other ingredients, adding the yeast-dough previously laid aside, and 
mix with the hands, briskly beating the whole in a contrary direction for 
twenty rtiinute? without ceasing. Cover with a cloth, and set in a warm 
closet to raise double, wjiich will take about half an hour. Butter a 
crown-shaped mold holding about three pints. When ready, take two 
ounces of peeled almonds fNo. 1207), mince fine, and add them to the 
dough, and beat well together for two minutes longer. Then with a 
spoon drop the paste carefully into the mold ; this not being quite filled 
to the top. Set aside again in the warm closet until the paste raises to 
the edge ; then place in a moderately brisk oven for twenty-five minutes. 
Should the oven be slow, thirty-five minutes will be necessary. To 
ascertain whether the cake be perfectly baked , thrust the point of a lard- 
ing-needle into the centre, and should any dough adhere to it, the cake 
must be left in five minutes longer. 

When done, turn it out on a plain, round wire grate, and glaize it with 
a firm glace % I'eau made as follows : put into a sugar-pan one ounce of 
granulated sugar, with one tablespoonful of cold water, and let it come to 
a boil ; remove, and add immediately a tablespoonful of curajoa, mixing 
well together. Glaze the cake with this, then let cool. Place a folded 
napkin on a dessert-dish, dress the cake nicely on top, and serve. 

1198. Savarin Cake, hot. -Prepare a savarin cake exactly as for the 
above (No. 1197), and when unmolded, place it on a wire grate, but dd 
not glaze it. Pour into a saucepan a pint of cold water with five ounces 
of granulated sugar, and let boil for five minutes. Take it off, and add 
immediately half a gill of kirsch, mixing it in well. Place the grate with 
the savarin in a vessel, take hold of the handle with the right hand, and 
drop the syrup carefully all over the top; lift up the grate and cake. Re- 
move the syrup remaining in the vessel into the pan, boil it again; return 
the grate and cake to the vessel, and pour over the remaining syrup. 
Then, lifting the grate on one side, glide the cake carefully onto a dessert- 
dish. Put into a saucepan four ounces of candied cherrifcs with half a gill 
of kirsch. Stir it slightly until it comes to a boil and decorate the top of 
the cake with- it ; then serve. 



DESSERTS. 345 



1199. SaTarin Cake k I'Anglalse.— Prepare a savarin cake as for No. 
1 197; when unmolded, place it on a wire grate ; do not glaze it. Cut it 
evenly through the centre, so as to make two equal discs. Garnish the 
top of the under one with four ounces of apricot marmalade (No. 1335); 
arrange the other half on top as carefully as possible, so that the cake has 
its origfinal form. Have a dessert-dish with a folded napkin ; dress the 
cake on top, and serve with a sauce-bowl of crfeme ^ l'Anglaise(No. 1200) 
separately. 

1300. Creme tt I'Anglaise. — Put into a saucepan two ounces of butter 
and one ounce of flour. Place on a slow fire, and with a spatula stir 
slightly for two minutes, adding two ounces of Sugar, half 1 gill of 
Madeira wine, and one gill of Middletown milk; stir well again for two 
minutes, to avoid its coming to a boil. Then take it from the fire, and 
immediately add half a gill of rum, stirring it slightly again. Pour the 
creme into a sauce-bowl and serve with the savarin. 

1201. Brioches. — Take half a pound of sifted flour, put two ounces of 
it into a vessel. Make a hollow in the centre, and put into this two 
drachms of compressed yeast and half a gill of lukewarm milk. Dissolve 
well the yeast with the milk for about one minute, then quickly beat in 
the flour for one minute. Cover the vessel with a cloth, and let it rest in 
a warm closet for fifteen minutes. Put in another vessel the remaining 
six ounces of flour, make a hollow in the centre, and put into it half a 
saltspoonful of salt, three whole eggs, two tablespoonfuls of sweet cream, 
two ounces of fresh butter, and one ounce of powdered sugar. Mi.x 
thoroughly with the hand, all except the flour, for three minutes, men 
incorporate the flour gradually, and beat it sharply with the hands for three 
minutes. Add one egg, beat oiie minute; add another, and beat one min- 
ute longer. Take four ounces of fresh butter, spread it in pieces over the 
paste, then mix in well for two minutes. The yeast being properly raised 
double by this time, add it to the other ingredients, and mix the whole 
carefully by cutting it several times with the hand, being sure to repeat 
this for at least five minutes. Cover the vessel with a cloth, and lay it in 
a closet or elsewhere, at a moderate temperature of about eighty degrees, 
for three hours, when it will be raised to twice the size. Then with the 
right hand cut it again into pieces in every direction, for about four min- 
utes. Then recover the vessel with the cloth, and leave it in a cool 
place for thirty minutes. Dredge a board with flour, pour the paste over 
it; then cut off a three-ounce piece, and lay it aside. With the hands roll 
up the remaining part of the paste into a ball. Butter well a round, two- 
quart mold, line it with paper, and put in the paste. Take the piece laid 
aside, and roll it pear-shaped with the hands. Make a small cavity in the 
centre of the paste in the mold, using a spoon. Arrange the pear-shaped 
piece in this, having the larger part on top. Then lay the mold on a 
baking-sheet ; glaze ' the top lightly with beaten egg, and put it in a 
moderate oven. After it has been in fifteen minutes, cover it with a 
buttered paper, close the oven door, and bake lor one hour more ; test it 
by thrusting in a larding-needle, and if no dough adheres to this the brioche

is thoroughly cooked: if not, leave it in ten minutes longer. Remove 
from the oven, unmold, and let it cool. Dress on a dessert-dish with a 
folded napkin, and serve. i 

1202. Small Brioches. — Prepare the dough as for the above (No. 
1201), and when raised to twice the size, lay it upon a board which has 
been" lightly dredged with flour. Cut out a piece of three ounces, and lay 
it aside until needed, then cut the rgst of the paste into twelve equal 
pieces, and with the right hand roll them into separate balls. Lay these 
in a pastry baking-pan. Divide the paste laid aside into twelve parts, roll 
them out, and give each a pear-shape. With a spoon make a cavity in the 
centre of each ball, and put into each one of the pear pieces, having the 
larger part on the top. Leave them to rise in a closet for fifteen minutes; 
glaze them lightly with beaten egg, and put them in a brisk oven for twelve 
or fifteen minutes, but no longer. Remove, and with a light hair-brush 
glaze them all over with fresh butter. Keep in a wariti place until ready 
to serve. If the brioches should be required cold, do not glaze them with 
butter, but dress them on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin. It is better 
to prepare the paste the evening previous, covering it with a cloth, and 
leaving it in a cool place over night. 

1203. Brioche k la Cond^. — Have a ■brioche co^ied-as for No. 1201, 
and when done, cut it in two, crosswise. Then with a spoon spread over 
the top of the lower half four ounces of apricot maripalade (No. 1335), 
mixed with one ounce of melted butter. Then replace the other half on 
top. Put in a saucepan two ounces of candied cherries, four ounces of 
candied apricots, cut in slices, and four ounces of candied pineapple. Add 
half a pint of cold water, and boil well together on a hot fire for three 
minutes. Dress the brioche on a dessert-dish, pour the preparation over, 
and serve hot. 

1201. Brioches FInttes. — Prepare a brioche paste, as for No. 1203 ; 
lay it on a floured board, and cut it into twelve equal pieces. Roll out 
each one separately with the hands until it is ten inches, or three finger- 
lengths, long, rounding them into shape. Put them in a pastry baking- 
pan, and leave them in a closet to rise for ten minutes ; take out and 
glaze them lightly with beaten eggs, sprinkle them over with powdered 
sugar, and put them in the oven for ten minutes ; refcove, and dress them 
on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve when cool. These 
brioches will keep well for three or four days, and they are delicious 
when served with tea, coffee, or chocolate. 

1205. Allumettes. — Take three quarters of a pound of feuilletage (No. 
1076) ; spread it out twelve inches long to four inches wide. Cover with 
a thin layer of glace royale (No. 1206). Divide it into six even pieces ; 
put them in a pan, and let rest for five minutes. Then place in a moder- 
ate oven, and bake for forty minutes, until of a good golden color. Serve 
either hot or cold. 

1206. Glace Boyale for Allnmettes. — Put into a small bowl half the 
white of a raw egg and' two ounces of extra fine sugar, and beat well 
with a spatula, Drop in carefully iust one drop, and no more, of lemon 



DESSESTS. 347 



juice; beat again for five minutes, until ttiicliened ; it will then be ready 
for use. 

1207. How to Peel and Found Abnonds.— Put the almonds into boil- 
ing water; let them, soak three minutes; strain, and lay them in cold 
water to thoroughly cool. Drain well again, and peel by pressing each 
almond between the thumb and fingers. Then put them into a sieve, and 
place them at the door of a slow oven to dry for ten minutes. Now pound 
them gently in a mortar, stirring well to prevent them from getting oily, 
and taking care to pound them very fine for at least ten minutes. Lay 
them on a cold dish, and use when needed. 

1208. Almond Cake Glac^. — Put a quarter of a pound of powdered 
sugar and a quarter of a pound of butter into a bowl; beat well together 
with a wooden spatula for ten minutes. Break in two eggs; beat well, 
and break in two more; continue beating, and break in two more (six in 
all), until well mixed together. Then grate in the peel of the third of a 
small lemon. Add two ounces of peeled and pounded almonds (No. 1207), 
and a quarter of a pound of flour. Mix gradually together for no longer 
than two minutes. Butter and sugar a round form holding one quart, 
and pour the preparation into it. Place it in a slow oven for one hour. 
See that it gets a good golden color. Take it out; let it get thoroughly 
cool, and remove from the mold. Lay it on a dish with a folded napkin. 
Glaze the top lightly with a small hair-bush, as for No. 1206, until it 
looks well, and send to the table. 

1209. Bitter Almond Macaroons. — Take a quarter of a pound of sweet 
almonds, and two ounces of bitter almonds: peel and pound them as for 
No. 1307. Put them into a bowl with twelve ounces of powdered sugar 
and the whites of two eggs. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spatula for 
at least five minutes. Then take a pastry-bag (No. 1079), slide down to 
the bottom of it a No. 3 tube (which should not be larger than a five-cent 
piece), and pour the preparation into the bag. Prepare a. pastry baking, 
pan; lay on it a piece of brown paper the full size of the pan (do not put 
it on the stove at present); then with the two hands press the preparation 
down gently into the papered pan, dropping it carefully into bits the size 
and shape of a silver quarter-dollar, trying to have them as near alike as 
possible, and taking care that each is entirely separated from the others. 
Take a damp towel and drop it gently on to the macaroons, so as to shape 
them perfectly. Then place the pan in a slow oven for twenty minutes. 
Before lifting them out, be careful that they are a good golden color. Let 
them get thoroughly cool. To remove the macaroons easily from the 
paper, wet part of a table; lay the paper over this for two minutes, and 
the macaroons will detach very easily. The above quantity will make 
about fifty macaroons. Put aside in a jar those not needed, as they will 
keep perfectly fresh for several days. 

1210. Sweet Macaroons. — Proceed as for bitter macaroons (No. 1209), 
only omitting the two ounces of bitter almonds, and substituting for them 
two extra ounces of sweet almonds, or six ounces in all. 

1211. Apple Cake. — Peel and core four fine, sound pippin apples. 



548 THE TABLE. 



Put them into a saucepan with two ounces of boiled and peeled chestnuts, 
and a piece of cinnamon an inch long. Toss well on the lire for ten min- 
utes, then transfer them to a copper basin, stirring in a teaspoonful of 
corn-starch, and adding a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar. Place 
on a slow stove for ten minutes, then put aside. When thoroughly 
cooled, add three egg yolks and one whole one ; mix well with a wooden 
spatula, and the preparation will be ready for use. Take a three-pint, 
square mold, butter it lightly, and with a small hair-brush sprinkle in a 
little powdered sugar, and pour in the prepared apple. Place the mold in 
a tin pastry-pan, filling the latter to half the height of the mold with cold 
water, and place the whole in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. Take 
the mold from the pan, and lay on top of it a hot, deep dessert-dish, 
slightly larger than the cake ; turn the mold bottom up, and lift it off, 
leaving the cake on the dish. While the cake is in the oven, prepare the 
following sauce : mix in a* saucepan two egg yolks, one ounce of pow- 
dered sugar, half a pint of water, and half a teaspoonful of ground cinna- 
mon. Place on a brisk fire, and stir constantly for five minutes, not 
allowing it to boil. When the cream is ready, add half a glassful or a 
gill of rum, or any other kind of liquor. Mix well for half a minute, pour 
the sauce over the cake, and serve very hot. 

1212. St. Honors k la Rose Delmonico. — Peel neatly two medium- 
sized, sound, red oranges. Separate the sections carefully to avoid tear- 
ing the skin, as, should they lose any of their juice, they would become 
useless. Lay a sheet of paper over a tin pan, arrange the pieces of 
orange on top, and leave them in a warm place to dry for four hours. 
Wipe neatly twenty-four Malaga grapes, leaving on each about a quarter 
of an inch of stem, so that they shall remain firm while using them. Beat 
up a pint and a half of sweet cream k la vanille as for No. 1254, and lay it 
aside in a cool place until needed. Roll three ounces of pie-paste (No. 
1077) into a round piece eight inches in diameter. Lay it on a bakhig- 
sheet ten inches wide, and proceed to prepare a pate-^chou as follows : 

Put into a saucepan a gill of cold milk with one ounce of good butter, 
place it on a hot fire, and when boiling, add at once three ounces of well- 
sifted flour. Stir briskly with the spatula all round ; take it from the 
fire, set on a table, and add immediately a saltspoonful of powdered 
sugar, mixing well for one minute more. Break in an egg, stir briskly 
for one minute, break in another, mix again, and then another, mixing all 
together for two minutes. Slide down the pastry-bag (No. 1079) a tube 
(No. 3), pour in the above preparation, and press down the top with the 
hands onto the edge of the paste in the baking-sheet, so as to make an even 
border half an inch high, and with the remainder of the paste press down 
onto another baking-sheet into twenty-four small, round choux, half an inch 
in diameter, leaving them one inch apart., Glaze the surfaces with beaten 
egg, and place them in a brisk oven to bake for twelve minutes. Remove, 
and let them get thoroughly cold. Spread over the paste, inside the bor- 
der, two tablespoonfuls of apple sauce (No. 1328); then put it in a mod- 
erate oven to bake for twenty-five minutes. Remove, and put to cool for 



DESSERTS. 349 



thirty minutes. Make a paper cornet, cut off a quarter of an inch from 
the point, and put into it three ounces of currant jelly (No. 1326). Press 
this out gently, dividing it evenly into the twenty-four small choux. 
Cook one pound of granulated sugar as for No. 1264. Oil two square 
feet of the surface of a marble table, and place at hand the pan containing 
the sugai*. Plunge one of the grapes into this ; remove it immediately 
with a fork and lay it on the oiled table. Proceed the same with the other 
twenty-three, being careful to lay them one inch apart from each oth^r. 
Now dip twelve of the sections of prepared oranges into the sugar, one by 
one, and lay them on the oiled table exactly the same as the grapes. Dip 
carefully the surfaces of the small choux into the sugar, and lay them on 
the same oiled table. Then take the St. Honor6 bottom in the baking- 
sheet, and proceed to arrange it as follows : with the cooked sugar stand- 
ing on the right, lift the choux up, one by one, dipping one side of each 
lightly in the cooked sugar, arranging them on top of the p&te-4-chou 
border close together to form a crown. Should the sugar be too thick, 
return it to the stove, and let it boil up once ; then take it off, and dip the 
thin part of the oranges lightly in it, and lay them over the small choux, 
the thick part upward, each one adhering to the other, until they form 
the crown. Dip the tops of the grapes lightly into the same sugar, 
and place one on each join of the oranges, with another in the centre, the 
stems being upward ; attach to the small choux the six remaining grapes, 
dividing them evenly. Arrange a fancy paper on a dessert-dish, and lay 
the St. Honorfe over carefully, then take the fi-oth part only of the 
whipped cream ; transfer it to another vessel, and, with the whip, beat 
briskly for five minutes, adding half a gill of good cognac, a quarter of a 
gill of Swiss kirsch, and three ounces of well-pounded and sifted maca- 
roons (No. 1210). Mix well together for two minutes longer, and fill the 
empty space of the St. Honorfe with three-quarters of this preparation, 
keeping it as high as possible. With the use of the pastry-bag and fancy 
tube press down the rest of the cream, and decorate artistically the top 
and sides, taking care not to put any on the oranges, and send to the 
table. 

1213. Gingerbread k la Fraii<;al8e. — Make a hollow space in a pound 
of flour laid on the table. Peel and chop up very fine five ounces of 
almonds; put them into the hollow with a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, 
the same quantity of ground cloves, four ounces of powdered sugar, and 
seven ounces of fresh honey. Knead the ingredients well for five minutes, 
then mix in the flour, and knead the preparation with the hands in all 
directions for fully thirty minutes without ceasing. Finish by forming it 
into a ball. Lay this on a dish, cover it with <t napkin, and place it in a 
temperature of about 60° for six hours. Lay the paste on a floured table, 
and roll it out eighteen inches long by twelve wide. Butter well a baking- 
sheet, lay the paste on top, and put it in a very slow oven to bake for 
forty-five minutes. Remove, lay the baking-sheet on the table, cut the cake 
immediately into small pieces, lozenge shaped, one and a half inches long 
by one inch wide, or any other shape desired; let cool off thoroughly for 



350 THE TABLE. 



about twenty minutes, then dress on a glass bowl, and serve. The above 
cakes can be glazed with a glace k I'eau, as for No. 1197, and served the 
same. 

1214. strawberry Shortcake. — Put into a vessel half a pound of 
powdered sugar with half a pound of well-washed butter, grate in the 
rind of half a sound lemon, andj with the hand, mix well for ten minutes. 
Break in five whole eggs, one at a time, meanwhile mixing for ten min- 
utes longer, always with the hand. Then add gradually half a pound of 
well-sifted flour, and mix for three minutes. Cover a baking-sheet with 
brown paper, place on top three tin cake-rings, nine inches in diameter 
and one inch high. Divide the preparation equally into the three rings; 
then place in a moderate oven to bake for thirty minutes. Remove, and 
allow the cakes thirty minutes more to cool. Lift up the paper, with the 
cakes, turn it upside down on the table, remove the paper, and detach the 
cakes from the rings by passing a knife all around. Pick and clean thor- 
oughly three pints of fine, sound, ripe strawberries; have a dessert-dish 
with a fancy paper over, lay one of the cakes on top of this, spread over 
evenly two tablespoonfuls of whipped cream (No. 1254), then cover 
with half the strawberries, nicely and evenly divided. Sprinkle liberally 
with powdered sugar, then cover with another cake, spread over the same 
quantity of cream as before, then arrange the other half of the strawber- 
ries on top; dredge again with powdered sugar, and lay the last cake over 
all, sprinkling with more sugar. Slide down a tube (No. 2) into a pastry- 
bag (No. 1079), put into it six tablespoonfuls of whipped cream i la vanille 
(No. 1254), and with it decorate the top of the cake in an artistic manner, 
and send to the table. 

1215. Blackberry Shortcake. — Prepare and 'proceed exactly the 
same as for strawberry shortcake (No. 1214), only substituting three pints 
of well-picked, and thoroughly cleaned, fine, sound, ripe blackberries for 
the strawberries, and serving the same. 

1216. Baba. — Have ready half a pound of the best flour, one drachm 
of compressed yeast, and half a gill of warm water. Put three ounces of 
the flour into a vessel, make a hollow in the centre, and in it lay the yeast 
and water; with the hands mix the yeast gently with the water for three 
minutes, then mix all together gradually for three minutes more. 
Cover the vessel with a towel, and leave it in the warmest 
place in the kitchen (not on the stove), and after thirty minutes it will 
rise to twice the size. Lay the remainder of the flour on the table, make 
a hollow in the centre, putting in it an ounce of powdered sugai' arid four 
raw eggs. Mix the sugar and eggs with the hands; then add a gill of 
cream and half a. gill of good Madeira wine. Season with a drachm of 
very fine salt, and mix all with the flour for five minutes. Make a hollow 
in the centre again, and into this put five ounces of good, fresh, soft butter; 
mix well again for two minutes. If the prepared yeast-dough be now 
raised to its proper height, mix the two pastes together {or at least five 
minutes; return it to the vessel, leave it in the same warm place, covering 
it as before. When rested one hour, have ready two ounces of cleaned 



DESSEI^TS. 



351 



Sultana currants (No. 1080), two ounces of cleaned raisins (No. io8i),and 
one ounce of finely chopped citron. Grease with cold butter the inside of 
a cylindrical copper or tin form large enough to hold three pints. If the 
paste be now raised to twice the size, mix in the raisins, currants, and 
citron, stirring for five minutes; put it in the mold, and lay it in a warm 
place (not on the stove) for another twenty minutes. Then place it in a 
moderate oven for one hour. When a good golden color, remove, and let 
it cool slightly. Place a round dish over the mold, turn upside down, 
lift off the form, and glaze the cake with a glace d I'eau (No. 1197). Deco- 
rate the top and dish with candied fruits, and send to the table. 

1217. Baba an Uadfere. — Prepare a baba cake exactly the same as for 
the above (No. 1216); but do not glaze it. Slit the cake in two, and remove 
the top piece. Pour a pint of cold water in a very clean pan, add half a 
pound of sugar and half a medium-sized sound lemon. Place it on the 
stove, and boil well for three minutes; then remove, and at once add a 
gill of good sherry wine and half a gill of cura9oa. Lay the top part of 
the cake in a round, flat-bottomed vessel. To avoid breaking it, a wire 
basket is recommended, with which it can be lowered carefully onto the 
pan. Pour gradually over it the prepared sauce; let it rest for two min- 
utes, then replace it carefully on top of the other half of the cake. 
Arrange it nicely on a dessert serving-dish, garnish tastefully with can- 
died cherries, and decorate the border with small, thin slices of candied 
pineapple. 

For Babaau Rhum, substitute Jamaica rum for the sherry. 

1218. Baba, Creme a la Yanille. — Prepare a baba cake as for No. 
1216. When removed from the mold and laid on a dish, cut it into six 
equal parts. Take six ounces of apricot marmalade (No. 1335), and pro-

THE TABLE. 



sweet almonds (No. 1207) cut into small pieces. Mingle all well together 
with the hand for five minutes, and with the other hand drop in one gill 
of brandy. Have a round cake-mold holding two quarts; butter it lightly 
with a hair brush, and sprinkle in a little sugar. Drop a third of the 
preparation into the mold; spread over it two ounces of candied orange, 
shred into thin slices; then add half of the remaining preparation; spread 
on top of it two ounces of shred, candied citron, and fill the mold with the 
rest. Lay a piece of brown paper over, and put the mold into a very mod- 
erate oven for two hours. Let it get a good golden color. Remove, and 
cool off in the mold, 'which will take about three hours. Remove the cake 
by turning it bottom up. Arrange a lace paper on a dessert-dish. Glaze

sugar with it. Put two ounces of this into a saucepan with two ounces of 
sifted flour, one egg yolk, and two whole eggs, two teaspoonfuls of good 
brandy, and half a saltspoonful of salt. Stir all together with a wooden 
spatula, and after two minutes, when the paste is well mixed, stir it again 
for one minute only. Put two vounces of good butter into a separate sauce- 
pan ; as soon as the scum rises, stir it carefully for one minute, and let it 
cool slightly. Then spread it well over the sides of a three-pint made- 
leine-mold. Put the saucepan containing the preparation on a very slow 
fire ; stir slightly to prevent it adhering to the bottom of the sauce- 
pan, and as soon as it becomes liquid take it off, and fill the mold. Lay it

hand, and the upper part with the right, press with the latter, and drop 
the batter on the paper in straight strips four inches long by one inch 
wide. Make ten of equal size on each paper, being careful to leave an 
empty space of three quarters of an inch between each. Then with a 
sugar-dredger sprinkle them lightly with powdered sugar three times, at 
one minute's interval between each sprinkling. When finished, lift up 
one paper at a time, keeping it perfectly straight, and shake off the loose 
sugar, being particular that the biscuits , do not detach from the paper. 
Now lay them in a pastry baking-pan, and let rest for two minutes ; put 
them into a slow oven, and bake for twenty minutes, until of a light golden 
color. Remove, lift them from the pan, and lay on a table to cool off. 
Have ready a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, then detaching the bis-

dish, and send to the table. 

1232. Biscuit h, la Riclielien. — Put half a pound of sugar, half a pound 
of peeled and pounded almonds as for No. 1207, and four egg yolks into 
a bowl, and with a spatula mix well together for two minutes. Place the 
whites of eight eggs in a copper basin, with half a saltspoonful of salt, 
and with a wire whip beat them to a, stiff froth ; add this to the above 
preparation, with three ounces of melted butter, three ounces of flour, and 
a teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring. Mix slowly together for three min- 
utes. Butter a plain mold holding three quarts ; line the interior thor- 
oughly, and pour in the preparation ; place it in a moderate oven for an 
hour and a half, then remove, and let it cool, and unmold. Dress on a 
dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve. 

1233. Biscuit k la Livornaise. — Prepare the paste exactly as for the 
above (No. 1232), and when ready have a square tin pan, lined all through 
with paper. Spread the paste over an inch thick with a knife, and put it 
in a moderate oven for^ighteen minutes. Take it out, and when cool 
lay the cake on a table ; detach the paper, sprinkle the surface freely 
with powdered sugar, and cut it into any shaped pieces desired. Dress 
on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve. 

1234. Petits Biscuits Ainbrosiennes.. — Proceed the same as for biscuits 
k la cuillfere (No. 1231). After the paste has been placed in the bag, have 
a well-cleaned pastry baking-pan, well buttered and lightly sprinkled with 
flour. Drop the paste carefully into the pan, forming biscuits, each 
about two inches long, by one inch wide. There should be in all about 
forty biscuits. Place them in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. Re- 
move, and lay them on a table. With a hair-brush spread over them six 
ounces of apricot marmalade (No. 1335), and glaze them with a glace k

eggs, and beat the , preparation thoroughly for five minutes; then 
separately beat the whites to a froth with a pastry wire whip, and mix in 
with the yolks and sugar, adding also one ounce of flour. Stir thoroughly 
with a wooden spatula until perfectly firm, which will require about five 
minutes. It is now ready. Have six paper boxes, any shape desired, 
and fill them with the preparation, using a tablespoon for the purpose. 
Sprinkle the tops with a little finely powdered sugar, arrange them in a 
pastry baking-pan, and put in a slow oven for fifteen minutes ; they must 
get a good golden color. Remove, and when cooled off, dress nicely on a 
dish, and serve. 

1236. Chausson Cakes. — Roll half a pound of feuilletage paste (No. 
1076) into a piece eighteen inches long by three wide, and pare off the 
edges lightly. Cut out six square pieces, all the same size, and with a 
pastry-brush moisten the surfaces with beaten egg. Fold up each piece 
by laying one corner over the other, so they will have a triangular shape. 
Put them on a baking-sheet in the oven for twenty minutes; remove them 
to the oven door ; dredge plenty of powdered sugar over, put them back, 
and close the door for one minute and a half, to allow the sugar to melt 
thoroughly. Remove from the oven, and cool for twenty minutes. The 
cakes will have risen about two inches in front.- Then, with the thickest 
part of a larding-needle, make a hollow in front of each cake. Put three 
ounces of currant jelly (No. 1326) into a paper cornet, and with it fill the 
insides of the cakes. Dress them on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, 
and serve. 

1237. Petites BoucMeS des Dames. — Put into a pastry-bag (No. 1079) 
half the quantity of biscuits-a.-la-cuill6re preparation (No. 1231). Butter 
and iiour a baking-sheet, and form about fifty small, round biscuits tho 
exact shape of macarobns. Sprinkle slightly with powdered sugar, and 
place in a brisk oven to bake for twelve minute's. Remove, and set to 
cool for fifteen minutes. Then lift them from the pan, and lay them up- 
side down on a table. With a knife make a small cavity in the centre of 
each, half an inch in diameter, and fill these with a pastry cream (f^o. 
1242). Fasten them, two by two, to enclose the cream; they will then be 
ball-shaped. .Dip carefully one after the other into a glace preparation 
as for chocolate 6clairs (No. 1243). Lay them on a pastry-grate to 
dry for' fifteen minutes; then dress on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, 
and send to the table.

sheet. Put into a pastry-bag (No. 1079) half the quantity of the biscuits- 
jl-la-cuillfere preparation (No. 1231), and drop it on the baking-sheet into 
Lima-bean-shaped pieces, one and a half inches long by half an inch wide. 
Sprinkle them lightly with powdered sugar, and place them in a brisk, 
oven to bake for twelve minutes. Take then^ out and let them cool for 
fifteen minutes, then put them on a. table upside down, and in the 
middle of each one cut a hole one inch long by a quarter of an inch wide. 
Fill the holes with apricot marmalade (No. 1335), then unite them, two by 
two, so as to enclose the marmalade and be the perfect shape of Lima

beans. Glaze them neatly by dipping them separately into a glace prep- 
aration as for 6clairs h. la vanille (No. 1245), and lay them at once on 
a pastry-grate to dry for fifteen minutes. Dress them on a dessert- 
dish with a folded napkin, and serve. The remainder of the paste may 
be used the following day. 

1239. Fancy Almond Cakes. — Peel and pound half a pound of 
almonds as for No. 1207; then add two egg whites; when thoroughly 
pounded, put them into a vessel with ten ounces of powdered sugar, and 
the grated rind of a good lemon; then, with the hand, knead well together 
for twenty minutes. Slide a fancy tube (No. 3) into a pastry-bag (No. 
1079), and pour in the above preparation. Cover a baking-sheet with 
brown paper, and holding the top of the bag with the right hand, guide 
the bottom with the left, and press the paste through onto the paper in 
small round bits one inch wide and half an inch high. Make ten of these, 
being careful to keep them one inch apart. Make ten more, shaped like 
the letter S, using the same quantity as for the others; then ten more, 
crescent-shaped, or like the letter C; and with the remainder of the paste 
make ten more, heart-shaped, being careful to keep them from touching 
one another. Take five candied cherries, cut them in halves, and arrange 
them on top of the round cakes; have twenty dried currants (No. 1080), 
and place one on each end of the S. Cut a candied apricot ii^ two, and each 
half into five slices, and lay them on top of the crescents, and lastly have 
one ounce of candied angelica- cut into very thin strips, and arrange them 
nicely on the heart-shaped pieces. 

It would be advisable to prepare these cakes the evening before they 
are needed, and lay them aside in a warm place over night. The next 
morning, glaze them lightly with beaten egg, using a pastry-brush, and 
place them in a brisk oven to bake for ten minutes. When of a nice brown 
color, remove, and let them become thoroughly cold. Lift them up care- 
fully with the paper, laying them gently upside down on a table, and 
with a wet towel moisten the paper, so that the cakes will detach easily. 
Turn the paper over immediately as it stood before, let rest for two min- 
utes; then remove the cakes. Lay them on a pastry-grate upside down, 
to allow them to dry for thirty minutes. Dress them on a glass stand 
with a folded napkin, and send to the table. 

1240. Pate-k-Chou. — Put into a saucepan two gills of cold milk and 
fwo ounces of butter. Place it on the range, stir slightly with the spatula, 
and when boiling, immediately add a quarter of a pound of well-sifted flour ; 
stir briskly for two minutes. Then stand. the pan on a table. Break in one 
egg; mix sharply for two minutes, break in a second egg, mix sharply again ; 
and repeat with a third and a fourth egg; then the pite-i-chou is ready. 

1241. Eclairs. — Arrange in a pastry-bag (No. 1079), a tube (No. 3); put 
into it the above quantity of pate-a.-chou (No. 1240), and press out upon a 
baking-sheet fifteen Eclairs, each one three inches long. Bake them in a 
hot oven for twenty minutes. Remove, and let them cool; then with a 
pair of scissors open each 6clair on one side, and with a spoon fill the 
interiors with a crSme patissifere (No. 1242).

1242. Greme Patissiere. — Put a pint of .-old milk into a saucepan, and 
place it on the stove. Mix in another vessel two ounces of powdered 
sugar, with one ounce of flour, and half an ounce of corn-starch. Break 
in two whole eggs, and beat well together with the whip for two ihinutes. 
When the milk is boiling, add it to the preparation, and after stirring for 
one minute longer, put it into another saucepan, and place it on the stove. 
Beat well until it comes to a boil; then remove from the fire, and add 
immediately a teaspoonful of vanilla essence. Mix thoroughly again for 
one minute longer; then pour it into a bowl, and let it get cold. 

1243. How to Glaze Eclairs with Chocolate. — Put in a saucepan one 
pound and three quarters of granulated sugar and a gill of cold water. 
Place on the stove, and with a spatula mix well until the sugar is thor- 
oughly melted, and when boiling remove from the stove, and pour it 
gradually on a marble slab, on which it will spread about three feet 
square. Let it cool off for ten minutes. Then cut two ounces of cocoa 
into small pieces; ,put them on a plate, and leave them at the oven door to 
melt. With a spatula begin working the sugar that is on the marble as 
rapidly as possible in every direction until it begins to whiten; then add 
the melted cocoa, mixing it thoroughly again until it becomes hard; 
remove the spatula, and detach the preparation quickly from the marble 
with a knife. Put it into a vessel, and covering it with a damp cloth, let 
it rest for thirty minutes. Then place half of it in a saucepan on the hot 
stove, and with the spatula mix thoroughly and slowly until it is luke- 
warm, meanwhile adding a teaspoonful of cold water. Take the Eclairs, 
one by one, and with the hand dip them into this preparation. Lay them 
on a pastry - grate ; let them cool off for five minutes ; dress on a 
dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve. 

Keep the rest, of the preparation for further use. When laid aside in 
a cool place, and properly taken care of, .it will be as good in two weeks' 
time as when freshly made. 

1244. Eclairs an Caf6. — Hkve a pite-^-chou ready, as for No. 1240; 
then proceed to make the feclairs. Bake, and fill them with a crSme patis- 
sidre (No. 1242) exactly as for the chocolate eclairs ; glazing them the same 
as for No. 1243, only instead of cocoa use half a gill of coffee essence 
(No. 1263). Serve precisely the same. 

12^5. Eclairs k la YaniUe. — Prepare a pite-a-chou as for No. 1240. 
Make the Eclairs, bake, and fill them with acreme patissifere, as No. 1242.

put it into the bag. Press it down onto a baking-sheet into six round, equal 
cakes, about two inches high. Glaze the surface of each with beaten egg. 
Bake in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. Watch thefm ^carefully, and 
when they are of a good golden color, remove from the oven and let cool 
for half an hour. Make an incision on one side, about half-way in the 
cakes, using a pair of scissors. Fill the insides with creme patissifere 
(No. 1242), and close them again. Dredge well with powdered sugar,

and dress on a dessert-dish, with a folded napkin, before sending to the 
table. 

1247. Meringnes. — Put six egg whites into a copper basin, with a 
light half saltspoonful of salt, and with a wire whip begin beating slowly, 
but gradually increase until a stiff froth is obtained. Should it become 
grainy, beat briskly again, adding half an ounce of powdered sugar. 
(Eight minutes should suffice to have a proper froth.) Remove the whip. 
Have on a plate one pound of powdered sugar, and with a sptSula drop 
the sugar slowly and carefully over the froth, mixing it in meanwhile 
with the spatula. This should take about two minutes. Flavor it with 
any desired flavoring, and it will be ready for use. 

1248. Apples, Meringnees. — Have six fine apples cooked as for No. 
1169; dress them on a dessert-dish, filling the cavities with currant jelly 
(No. 1326)" then decorate all round and the tops with mfiringue, prepared 
as for No. 1247, half the quantity being sufficient. Sprinkle them moder- 
ately with powdered sugar; lay the dish on a baking-pan, and put it in the 
oven for five minutes. When a light brown color, remove, and serve 
either hot or cold. 

1249. Small Fancy Meringues & la Ch. C. Delmonico.— Put into a 
sugar-pan one pound of granulated sugar with half a. pint of cold water, 
and place on the hot stove. Have two quarts of ice-water in a vessel, 
and when the sugar comes to a boil, dip the fingers of the right hand into 
the ice-water and pass them quickly around the inside of the pan, and let 
boil for five minutes. Dip a wooden stick, similar to a pen-holder, in the 
ice-water, then quickly into the boiling sugar, and again in the ice-water, 
lifting up the stick to feel the sugar that adheres. Should it not be suffi- 
ciently consistent to form into a ball, let boil a little longer; then try once 
more; and should it be a propft- thickness, remove from the fire and set 
it on the corner of the stove, so that it no longer boils. While the sugar 
is cooking, beat the whites of five eggs in a copper basin until they are a 
firm froth; and while beating, have an assistant pour very gradually the 
prepared, sugar into the egg-froth; and when all is added, lay the basin 
containing the preparation into a vessel half filled with ice-water. Remove 
the whip, and using a wooden spatula, mix gently for five minutes, add- 
ing a teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring. Cover the basin with a napkin, 
letting it rest for ten minutes. Butter and flour a baking-sheet; slide 
down a fancy tube (No. 3) into a pastry-bag (No. 1079), fill it with the 
preparation, press down onto the baking-sheet, giving a C-shape, two 
inches long by one wide, to forty of them; and then forming twenty more, 
shaped like the letter D. Sprinkle them lightly with powdered sugar; 
place in a very slow oven, and let bake for fifteen minutes. When baked, 
these cakes should be perfectly white. Remove them from the oven, let 
get thoroughly cold; dress on a glass stand, and send to the table.

high. There will be enough to make eighteen equal-sized shells. Be 
careful to keep them one inch apart. Sprinkle over liberally with pow- 
dered sugar, and place in a very slow oven to bake thirty minutes. Re- 
move, and set to cool for twenty-five minutes. Then turn the paper con- 
taining the shells upside down on the table; and with a wet cloth or 
brush moisten well the paper; turn them over again, and let rest for two 
minutes, when the shejls will detach easily. With the finger press them 
gently, *ne by one, in the bottom, into a perfect shell-shape. Return 
them to the bakitig-sheet, laying them upside down, and put them in the 
6ven to dry thoroughly for ten minutes; then leave them to cool for thirty 
minutes more. Keep them in a dry place,, either in a tin or paper box, 
and use when required. Mferingue-shells prepared this way will keep 
nicely for at least twenty-five days. 

1251. Swiss Meringues Si I'HelT^tienne. — Have a mfirinfeue prepara- 
tion as for No. 1247; slide down in a pastry-bag (No. 1079) a tube (No. 4). 
Butter and flour a baking-sheet ; make on it one design eight inches in 
diameter ; another exactly the same shape, only six inches, and another of 
the same, only four inches. Put the meringue into the bag, and press it 
down gently over and around the first design, making the paste three- 
qjiarters of an inch thick ; repeat the same for the second and third forms. 
Press down in the pan some more mferingue, making a little cone four 
inches high, two inches in diameter at the base, and tapering gradually to 
a point at the top. Sprinkle the whole lightly with powdered sugar, and 
place the pan in a very moderate oven to bake for twenty-five minutes. 
Take it out, and let it thoroughly cool for half an hour. Have a quart of 
whipped creme S, la vanille (No. 1254), add to it half a gill of Swiss kirsch 
and half a gill of maraschino, and with a pastry-whip beat the whole 
together for three minutes. Have ready a round dessert-dish with a 
fancy paper over, detach carefully the largest form from the pan, lay it 
on the dish, detach the second, lay it over the first, and fill the hollow , 
space with half of the cream ; now detach the third and smallest piece and , 
lay it over the others, filling it entirely with part of the cream, and finally 
detach the cover, and arrange it nicely on the top. Pour the remaining 
cream into the pastry-bag containing the fancy tube, and with it decorate 
the places where the rings are joined. Then send to the table. 

1^252. Creme Eenvers^e. — Put in a copper sugar-pan three ounces of 
granulated sugar with half a. gill of cold water. Toss the pan briskly to 
melt the sugar well; then place it on the stove, and let it boil slowly until it 
becomes a light brown color. If a moderate fire, it will require four min- 
utes, but if a brisk one only two will suffice ; this will now be a caramel. 
Take a pudding-mold holding ' one quart ; line the interior with all the 
caramel, holding the mold in the left hand, and spreading it evenly all 
round. Put the mold in a cool place, and let it become thoroughly cold. 
Have one pint of milk in a. bowl ; break in four eggs, add a quarter of a 
pound of powdered sugar and a teaspoonful of lemon essence. Beat well

hours. Turn it on a dessert-dish, and serve with its own juice. 

1253. Crfinie en Mousse au CaK. — Take a pint of whipped cream as 
for No. 1254, add three (ablespoonfuls of coffee essence (No. 1263), and 
beat well together for five minutes. Transfer it to a china bowl, and put 
it in a cold ice-box. When ready to serve, use a spoon to drop the cream 
carefully upon the centre of a cold, round dessert-dish, keeping it as high 
as possible, shaping it into a pretty, artistic dome. Send immediately to 
the table. 

1254. Whipped Cream & la Tanille. — Put a pint of sweet cream into a 
basin. Have a tub or large dish-pan containing chopped ice and a little

before using it. 

1255. Creme en Mousse au Rhum. — With a pint of fresh, sweet cream 
proceed as for No. 1254, adding a gill of rum, and beating well together 
for five minutes. Transfer, it into a. china bowl, and place in the ice-box 
until ready to use. When serving, have a cold dessert-dish, and with a 
wooden spoon drop the cream carefully into the centre of the dish, keep- 
ing it piled high as possible so to give it a pretty dome form, and send to 
the table immediately. 

1256. Creme en Mousse an Eirsch. — Proceed as for No. 1255, only 
substituting a gill of kirsch for the gill of rum ; serve in the same 
manner. 

1257. Creme en Mousse an Maraschino. — Prepared the same as crSme 
en mousse au rhum (No. 1255), substituting a gill of maraschino for the 
rum. 

1258. Creme en Mousse an Cognac. — The same as for No. 1255, add- 
ing a gill of cognac instead of the rum, but serving the same way. 

1259. Cr^me en Monsse au Cura^oa. — Substituting a gill of cura9oa 
for a gill of rum, and proceeding precisely the same as for No. 1255. 

1260. Crfinie en Mousse. — To be prepared exactly the same, only 
using a gill of any other liquor desired, and serving the same as No. 1255. 

1261. Charlotte Rnsse il la Creme. — Take six small, round charlotte 
russe molds two and a half inches high, three inches in diameter at the 
top by two at the bottom. When thoroughly cleaned, line them with 
biscuits 4 la cuillere (No. 1231), Cut them in two, and should they be 
higher than the mold, trim them off to the edge. Pour the whipped cream 
(No. 1254) into a pastry-bag (No. 1079), and fill up the molds. Turn them 
over onto six dessert-plates, spread a little more cream on the top of each, 
and cover them each with one macaroon (No. 1210). Dress the rest of 
the cream nicely around the plates, and serve. 

1262. Charlotte Ensse au Caf6. — Line and prepare six small charlotte- 



362 THE TABLE. 



molds as for the above (No. 1261), adding to the whipped cream two table- 
spoonfuls of coffee essence (No. 1263). Beat thoroughly together for two 
minutes, then fill the molds, and serve as for the above. 

1263. Coffee Essence.— Take one ounce of good, ground coffee; place 
it in a small saucepan with half a pint of cold water, and let boil until 
reduced to about two tablespoonfuis. Then strain through a tloth, press- 
ing it well, and let cool thoroughly. Add it to the cream as described in 
No. 1262. 

1264. How to Cook Sugar. — Put into a sugar -pan one pound of 
granulated sugar, with half a pint of cold water; place it on a brisk stove. 
Kave a vessel containing two quarts of ice-water, and when the sugar 
comes to a boil dip the fingers of the right hand into the water, and quickly 
pass them all around the inside of the pan, being careful to avoid touching 
the sugar; repeat this two or three times. However difficult this opera- 
tion may appear, it is essential that it should be done, in order to have 
the sugar in a perfect condition. Take care to dip the fingers into the ice- 
water each time. Let the sugar boil; then squeeze in three drops of 
lemon juice. To know when it is sufficiently boiled, have a thin piece of 
wood the shape of a lar^ding-needle. Dip the point into the ice-water, and 
then plunge it into the boiling sugar; remove it quickly, and dip it imme- 
diately into the water again. Lift it out, and see whether the sugar adher- 
ing to the wood be thoroughly hard. If not, let boil again, and continue 
to test with the stick as before. To be certain that the sugar is perfectly 
done, place the point of the stick between the teeth, and bite it. Should 
the sugar stick to the teeth, it needs more boiling, but if it cracks easily 
without sticking, it is thoroughly done. Remove it immediately from the 
fire, and place the bottom of the pan in the ice- water to prevent the sugar 
from turning brown. 

The above cooked sugar can be used for glazing dried fruits and candied 
fruits of all kinds; also to fasten on pieces of of nougat, and to make any 
kind of caramels, etc., etc. 

1265. Burned Sugar. — Put into a small iron omelet-pan half a pound 
of granulated sugar, and place on a slow stove, to burn thoroughly for 
thirty minutes. Remove the pan to the table to cool slightly for five 
minutes, and then add half a pint of boiling water, mixing well with an 
iron spoon. Replace the pan on the stove, and boil for five minutes, stir- 
ring continually ; then strain the sugar through a sieve into a, vessel, and 
put in a cold place to cool thoroughly. Pour it into a bottle, and use 
when required. Burned sugar prepared this way will keep in perfect 
condition for several weeks. 

1266. Vongat. — Have ready four-ounces of peeled and dried almond 
(No. 1207). Cut each into four slices, and lay them in a tin pan with a 
sheet of paper under them. Put the pan in a warm place, but. not on the 
stove. Take a copper sugar-pah, or dropper, put into it six ounces of 
powdered sugar, and place it on a hot stove ; then with a. dry, wooden 
spatula stir continually, until the sugar is dissolved, ^eing careful to avoid 
browning it. Remove from the fire, add one drop of lemon juice, and let 



DESSEJiTS. 363 

it cool off slightly for three minutes, stirring constantly ; then add the 
almonds, mixing all gently with the spatula for two minutes. The nougat 
is now ready for use, and can be molded into cornets-d'abondance, columns, 
bases, or any shape the fancy may dictate. 

1267. Small Pyramid of Nougat.— Oil slightly the interior of a 
small, round base. Take half the nougat, prepared as for No. 1266, 
lay it on a marble table (the nougat should always be hot), roll it out very 
thin with an oiled roller, and with this lin^the oiled base. Then with a 
whole lemon sharply press the nougat onto the mold to give it a perfect 
form, cutting it evenly away all around the edge. Put the pieces with 
the rest in the pan, and place near the fire to keep/ hot. Have a small 
comet-d'abondance (corniicopia), oil it slightly, and line the inside with half 
the remaining nougat, rolled out as before, and pressing it the same. Cut 
away all the superfluous part, and let it cool slightly. Then unmold both 
the base and cornet. Oil a tartlet-mold, and line it with the rest of the 
nougat. Lay the base carefully upon a glass stand of suitable size, the 
covered part uppermost, and fasten to the stand with cooked sugar (No. 
1264). With cooked sugar fasten the cornet ini the middle, small end 
uppermost, using cooked sugar for the purpose. , Put the remaining 
piece from the tartlet-mold on top of all, and fasten it in the same way. 
All this should be done carefully and patiently. Have ready two well- 
peeled, sound oranges, pull them gently to pieces, looking closely at each 
separate section to see that the skin is not broken or loosened. Have a 
quarter of a pound of fresh Malaga gApes, detach them, leaving on each 
grape about a quarter of an inch of stem. Take also two ounces of candied 
cherries, plunge the grapes into the cooked sugar (No. 1264), and with a 
fork lift them up, and immediately lay them on a well-cleaned, oiled, 
marble table. Treat the pieces of orange and the cherries each the same 
way. During this time, should the sug&r become cool, heat it up once 
more ; fill the cornet with these fruits, dipping one side of each piece into 
the cooked sugar to make t}iem adhere together. With a part of them fill 
the tart-shaped piece on top, proceeding in the same manner, and decorate 
with glace royale (No. 1269). 

1269. Glace Boyale. — Put'the white of one egg into a small bowl. 
Beat it well with a small spatula, adding six ounces of extra fine sugar, 
and squeezing in three drops of lemon juice. Then continue beating for 
twenty minutes. When finished, it should he snow-white and pulpy. 
Make a small brown paper cornet, cut off the lower end, slide down a 
small fancy tube, and pour in some of the glace royale, covering the 
remainder of it with a damp cloth. Then with the cornet decorate the 
edge of the nougat base as in the preceding (No. 1268), also the upper 
edge, and all around the edge of the cornet, and finish by decorating 
artistically the tart-shaped piece on top; then send it to the table. 

All nougat pieces, when finished, should be kept in a moderate 
temperature. 

1270. Blanc-manger k la Josephine Delmonico. — Peel neatly six 
ounces of sweet almonds and two ounces of bitter almonds (No. 1207). 



364 THE TABLE. 



Put in a vessel, cover with cold water, and let them soak for fully one 
hour. Drain thoroughly through a sieve^ and pound them well in a 
mortar, adding, little by little, a gill of cold wat«r, and continue pounding

spatula, put on the lid, and let infuse for thirty' minutes. Then place the 
saucepan on the hot stove, and stir gently from the bottom, allowing it to 
boil slowly for four minutes. Remove it from the fire, and let the pan 
rest on the table for three minutes. Pour in the almond milk, mix again 
for two minutes, using the spatula, and strain the whole through a fine 
sieve into another vessel. Have a three-pint, channeled blanc-manger 
mold; put some broken ice at the bottom of a pail, place the mold on it, 
arranging more broken ice around the sides, so that the mold be entirely 
sunk in the ice as far up as the edge. Stir the preparation for one minute, 
then pour it into the mold, cover the pail with a napkin, and leave it to 
congeal for one hour. Take up the mold carefully from the pail, wipe off 
the ice with a towel, and have ready a cold dessert-dish with a folded nap- 
kin over. Turn out the blanc-manger onto this ; decorate the surface with 
two ounces of candied cherries and one ounce of angelica, and it is ready 
for the table. 

1271< Tanilla Ice-cream. — Boil In a saucepan one pint of milk with

:add it to the boiling milk, stirring for two minutes longer, and .pour the 
whole into a copper basin, placing it on a moderate stove to heat for five 
minutes, stirring at the bottom continually with the spatula, and being 
careful not to let it boil. Remove from off the fire, place it on a table, and 
add immediately one pint of sweet cream, still mixing it for two minutes 
more; let cool off for thirty minutes, then strain through a sieve into an 
ice-cream freezer; put on the lid, and lay it in an ice-cream tub, filling the 
freezer all round with broken ice, mixed slightly with rock-salt; then turn 
the handle on the cover as briskly as possible for three minutes. Lift up 
the lid, and with a wooden spoon detach ,the cream from all around the 
freezer,- and the bottom as well. Re-cover it, and turn the handle sharply 
for three minutes more; uncover, and detach the cream the same as before, 
being careful that no ice or salt drops in. Put the lid on, and repeat the 
same three tirnes more. The ice-cream should by this time be quite firm, 
so have a cold desSert-diish with a folded napkin, dress the ice-cream over, 
and send to the table. 

This same ice-cream can be formed into a single brick by having a 
brick-shaped form, filling it with the cream, and pressing it down quickly

the bottom, lay the mold over, and fill up the pail with more ice and salt. 
Let it freeze for two hours, and when ready to serve, have ready a vessel 
with warm water, take up the mold, bathe it in the water, and wash off 
all the salt and ice that adhere, then unmold the ice-cream onto a dessert- 
dish with a fancy paper over, and send to the table immediately. 

1291. Fndding Glac^ k la Frankie Cleveland. — Prepare half the quan- 
tity of vanilla ice-cream as for No. 1271; when frozen, let it rest, and pre- 
pare also half the quantity of biscuit-glac6 preparation (No. 1286), and 
when ready cover the basin, and let rest also. Have half a. pound of 
marrons glac6s (candied chestnuts); break them into pieces onto a plate ; 
take a three-pint melon-form, arrange the vanilla ice-cream all around it, 
dividing it evenly, and filling up with alternate layers of the biscuit prep- 
aration and the marrons glacis ; cover the mold tightly, and place it in a 
pail with broken ice mixed with rock-salt at the bottom, also filliiig the 
pail with more ice and salt, then let freeze for fully two hours. Two 
minutes before serving, bathe the mold in warm water to remove the ice 
and salt that adhere, unmold, and send to the table immediately with a 
sauce-bowl full of the following sauce : add to half a pint of whipped 
cream 4 la vanille (No. 1254) one gill of strawberry juice, and half a gill,

1293. Tutti-frutti. — Prepare a pint of vanilla ice-cream as for No. 
1271, half a pint of strawberry ice-cream (No. 1274), and half a pint of 
lemon water-ice (No. 1279); let them remain in the freezers. Put four 
ounces of candied cherries onto a plate, cut them in halves, and add two 
candied apricots cut into small pieces. Tal^e six tutti-frutti molds, open 
one of them, and lay on the cover a spoonful of strawberry ice-cream, 
with a spoonful of the lemon water-ice, one beside the other, press the 
sixth part of the candied fruits onto the ice-cream in the cover of the 
mold, filling the bottom with vanilla ice-cream, and close together firmly. 
Lay it immediately into a pail with broken ice and rock-salt at the bottom, 
cover the mold slightly with more ice and salt, then proceed to prepare 
the other five molds exactly the same. When they are all in the pail and 
covered as the first one, fill it up entirely with broken ice and salt, and let 
it freeze for one hou*. Have a vessel containing, warm water ready at 
hand, and prepare six small dessert-plates with a small fancy paper on 
each, lift up the molds, one after the other, wash them off quickly with 
the warm water, and unmold the tutti-fruttis onto the cold plates, and 
serve. 

1294. Plombiere k la Eing'man. — Put together into a saucepan eight 
egg yolks, half a pound of powdered sugar, a piece of vanilla-bean one 
inch long and split in two, also a pint of sweet cream, and six ounces of 
finely grated cocoa. Mix well with the spatula for two minutes, then 
place the pan on the hot stove, and stir constantly while heating, but 
under no circumstances must it boil. Remove it from the fire, and lay 
the pan in a cool place on the table for thirty minutes. Put an ice-cream 
freezer into a tub, fill it all round with broken ice mixed with rock-salt, 
remove the cover, and after wiping the freezer well, strain the prepara- 
tion through a sieve into it, cover it again, and with the hands turn the 
handle of the cover for five minutes in opposite directions. Lift up the 
cover, and with the spatula detach the preparation that adheres to the 
siifts, readjust the cover, and turn again the handle, beginning in an 
opposite direction from the first time ; after five minutes, detach from the 
si^es as before, and repeat for the third time the turning process. Finally 
lift oft the cover, and detach the cream from all around, and it will now 
be thoroughly firm, so cover it again, and let it rest. Beat up to a froth 
one gill of sweet cream as for No. 1254 ; take a glass or silver stand, and 
with an ice-cream spoon remove the cream from the freezer, spoonful by 
spoonful, and, dress it. in the centre of the bowl, keeping it as high as pos- 
sible, and giving it a pretty, pyramid shape. Fill a paper cornet with the 
whipped cream, cut off the point, and decorate artistically the top and 
sides of the plombifere. Chop up very fine two ounces of pistache, and 
sprinkle them evenly over the surface, then send to the table. 

1295. Parfait au Cafe k la Parisienne. — Place six ounces of powdered 
sugar in a saucepan with six egg yolks and a pint of sweet cream, and 
mix well together for two minutes ; set the saucepan on the hot stove, 
then stir gently and continually from the bottom, using a spatula, until 
nearly coming to a boil ; as this is difficult to determine on account of the 



VESSEJiTS. 371 



briskness of the fire, the best way to tell when it is sufficiently done i^ to 
lift up the spatula and see whether the cream adheres thickly to it, if so, 
remove the saucepan from the fire and lay it on the table, add immedi- 
ately to it four ounces of freshly roasted Mocha coffee in beans, then stir 
again well for one minute more. Remove the spatula, cover the sauce- 
pan with a napkin, put the lid on, and let infuse for one hour. Beat up 
one pint of fresh sweet cream as for No. 1254, and let rest until needed. 
Place an ice-cream freezer in a. tub, fill it up all round with broken ice 
mixed with rock-salt, wipe the cover nicely, and then remove it ; strain 
the infused preparation through a fine sieve into the freezer, put on the 
cover, then take hold of the handle, and turn th^ freezer briskly in oppo- 
site directions for five minutes ; remove the cover, and with the spatula 
detach all the cream that adheres to the sides and bottom, recover, and 
turn sharply as before ; remove the cover, detach the cream from the 
sides and bottom, replace the cover, and begin turning again in opposite 
directions for five minutes longer. The cream should now be thoroughly 
frozen. Drop the whipped cream into the freezer, very little at a time, 
meanwhile mixing it gently with the spatula, which should take four min- 
utes to accomplish it; then have ready a three-pint, channeled, ice-cream 
mold, and with an ice-cream spoon fill the mold with the preparation, and 
put on the lid. Place some broken ice with rock-salt at the bottom of a 
pail, lay the mold over, and fill up the pail with more ice and salt, then 
let freeze for fully one hour. Afterward remove the mold, dip it into 
lukewarm water, wipe away the ice and salt, and lift it up immediately, 
take off the cover, and turn the cream onto a cold dessert-dish with a 
folded napkin, and serve. 

1296. Eice and Cream k la Croce. — Put one pint of cold milk into a 

saucepan, adding one pint of cold water and half a saltspoonful of salt, 
place the pan on the hot stove, and when boiling, throw in four ounces of 
well-cleaned, raw rice; then with a spatula stir slowly and continually at 
the bottom while it is cooking for twenty-five minutes, then take the pan 
from off the fire, lay it on a table, and add immediately four ounces of 
powdered sugar and one ounce of fresh butter ; mix well together with a 
spatula for two minutes, then transfer it into another vessel, and set it in 
a cold place for one hour to have it thoroughly cooled off. Whip to a 
froth one pint of sweet cream as for No. 1254, cover the basin with a nap- 
kin, and let rest for twenty minutes ; should there be any milk settled at 
the bottom, pour it off, and add to the cream two ounces of powdered 
sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring, then with a wire whip beat 
well together for two minutes longer, and remove the whip. Take the 
rice from the vessel, drop it gradually into the whipped cream, then mix 
the whole together slowly and carefully for three minutes. Line a two- 
quart, tin melon-form with three ounces of peach marmalade (No. 1331), 
fill the mold with the preparation, put on the cover, and after placing a 
little broken ice at the bottom of a pail, lay in the mold, and cover it 
entirely with broken ice (no salt is necessary for this), and let freeze for 
one Hour. Have a vessel with two quarts of lukewarm water ; lift up

oranges, and with a pastry-tube, one and a quarter of an inch in diameter, 
cut off the tops of the oranges, then with a sma^l knife remove the covers 
gently, laying them aside until later. With either a Parisian-potato cutter 
or a spoon, empty the insides of the. oranges, being careful to avoid 
breaking any of the skin, for should that occur, they will be useless ; the 
interiors can be used for some other purpose. Arrange the oranges, with 
their covers on, in a square biscuit-glac6 box as for No. 1286 ; place the 
box in a tub, filling it with broken ice mixed with rock-salt, and let freeze 
for one hour. Prepare a champagne punch as for No. 1307, and with it 
fill the interior of the oranges, put on the covers, and with different col- 
ored ribbons tie each one, beginning at the top ; when at the bottom, turn 
the ribbon and bring it back to the top in an opposite direction, then make 
a graceful bow on top of the covers. Lay them again in the box, and let 
them freeze for one hour longec, then dress them on a dessert-dish with 
a folded napkin, and serve.

half the lemon ice-cream at the bottom, arrange a. third part of the fruits 
nicely over, dividing them equally, then cover with half of the coffee ice- 
cream, and with a spoon press it down well. Lay half the remaining 
fruits on top of this, and spread over the rest of the lemon ice-cream, 
then the last of the fruits, and fill up the mold with the balance of the 
coffee ice-cream. Close very firmly, and lay it into a pail with broken ice 
mixed with rock-salt at the bottom, and filling it with the same, then let 
freeze for two hours. Two minutes before serving prepare a vessel' with 
warm water, lift up the mold, and wash off the ice and salt, then unmold

spatula; when they begin to scald, pour them into a clean tub, and with a 
pounder mash them thoroughly. Strain them through a fTannel jelly-bag 
back into the copper basin, adding to the juice seven pounds of granulated 
sugar. Return the pan to the fire, and let boil until reduced to about half 
the quantity, 'then dip in a skimmer, lift it up, and feel the jelly with the 
two forefingers; close them, and open them slowly, if the jelly is 
mucilaginous, then it is done; if not, cook for a few minutes longer. 
Take it from the fire, and pour a little into every glass jar ready to use, 
as this will prevent them cracking. Afterwards fill them up. When

stove, and add immediately a pint of Bordeaux wine, replace it on the 
stove to heat thoroughly, but not allowing it to boil again ; take from off 
the fire, pour the prunes into a stone jar, let get cold, then serve. 

1331. Peach Marmalade. — Peel and cut into slices twelve good-sized, 
sound peaches ; put into a saucepan half a pound of granulated sugar and 
a pint of cold water ; place it on a hot stove, and let come to a boil,^then 
add the peaches, and cook for twelve minutes, stirring continually with 
the spatula. Remove from the fire, and strain through a pastry-sieve 
into a bowl, adding twelve peeled almonds (No. 1207), then let cool off 
thoroughly. Put it into a china bowl, lay it aside in a cool place, and 
use when needed. This marmalade will keep for several days if properly 
prepared. 

1332. Stewed Apples.— Take six fine, sound MiddlQtown pippin apples, 
peel them neatly, and with an apple-corer core them tiioroughly, then cut 



>78 THE TABLE. 



each apple into four quarters, and lay them in a saucepan with a pint of 
cold water, adding half a pound of granulated sugar. When the contents 
of the pan come to a, boil, skim well, and then flavor with the juice of 
half an orange, or the same quantity of lemon, and a saltspoonful of 
ground cinnamon can also be added. When flavored, let cook for five 
minutes longer, and with a spatula stir slowly from the bottom to avoid 
mashing the apples. Remove from the fire, pour into. a china bowl, and 
cool off thoroughly before serving. , 

1333. Stewed Pears. — Are to be prepared and cooked exactly the 
same as for the above (No. 1332). 

1334. Stewed Peaches. — Peel and cut into quarters ten medium-sized, 
sound, ripe peaches, removing the stones, put them into a saucepan with 
a pint of cold water, adding half a pound of granulated sugar. Place the 
pan on the stove, and when boiling skim well ; let cook for five minutes, 
meanwhile stirring them slowly -from the bottom, to avoid mashing the 
fruit; then remove, and immediately add a gill of kirsch, mixing well 
together, for about half a minute. Pour into a china bowl, let get cool, 
then dress on a dessert-dish, and serve. 

1335. Stewed Apricots. — Peel, cut, and stone twelve goodrsized apri- 
cots, or fifteen if they be smajl; then proceed to prepare them exactly as 
for stewed peaches (No. 1334), only substituting a gill of brandy for the 
kirsch. 

1336. Stewed Green-gages. — Have eighteen or twenty solid, ripe, 
green-gages, peel them neatly, cut them in halves, and stone them. Pro- 
ceed exactly the same as for stewed peaches (No. 1334), only replacing the 
kirsch by a gill of red cura9oa, and serving the same. 

1337. Stewed Plums. — Proceed exactly the same as for the above (No. 
1336), substituting the same quantity of plums for the green-gages. 

133S. Stewed Quinces. — Take twelve fine, firm, ripe quinces, peel and 
core them thoroughly, then cut them into quarters, and put them in a 
saucepan with a pint of. cold water and half a pound of granulated sugar. 
Place them on the stove; when boiling, skim well, and let cook for fifteen 
minutes, stirring them gently at the bottom with a spatula to avoid mash- 
ing the fruit. Remove from the fire, and immediately vadd a gill of 
maraschino; stir lightly again, then pour into a china bowl to let cool. 
Dress on a dessert-dish and serve. 

1339. Syrup for Preserril^ Fruits. — Put seven pounds of granulated 
sugar into a sugar-pan, adding five pints of cold water, and wheii on the 
hot stove, stir with the spatula until thoroughly heated, but it must not 
boil. Remove it from the fire, lay it aside, and use when needed for 
different fruits. The above quantity will produce five quarts at thirty 
degrees Fahrenheit. 

1310. Preserved Peaches. — The best variety for preserving are 
either the " Crawford Late," or " Smoke." Select one hundred thoroughly 
ripe, sound, medium-sized peaches; peel them neatly, cut them in halves, 
and remove the stones with care. Have ready ten patent lightning-glass 
jars, each holding one quart, or twenty holding only a pint each; then divide 



DESSEJRTS. 



379 



the peaches equally into them, and pour into each one pint of syrup 
prepared as for No. 1339, or half a pint, if using the pint jars, taking care 
that the peaches floating on the top should be entirely covered, even if it 
be necessary to press them down lightly. Put on the cover very tight, 
then bring the larger wire up in the very centre between the two small 
knobs, and press the smaller one downwards. Place the jars in a large 
saucepan standing, seeing that they do not tduch each other, otherwise 
they might break, and arrange a little hay or straw between every one. 
Fill the pan with cold water so as to cover the)j entirely, and placing it 
on the hot stove, let boil for ten minutes. Take from off the fire, stand 
the pan on a table, and with a towel lift up the jars one by one, layirig 
them most carefully on a dry kitchen table, and avoid putting them in a 
cold place. When all are so arranged, taking the towel into the hand, lift 
up the smaller wire, so that the gas slightly escapes for one minute, then 
immediately pull it down again until hermetically sealed. Let them stand 
till thoroughly cold, then put them away for general use. The right 
temperature for keeping them is from 65 to 75 degrees. Should the sauce- 
pan not be sufficiently large to contain all the jars, boil five at a time. 

The best time to select the peaches is from August 20 to Sep- 
tember 20. 

1341. Preserved Bartlett Pears. — Procure one hundred medium-sized^ 
sound, and fully ripe pears, fit to eat in their natural state ; peel them 
carefully keeping them in their original form, then split in halves, and cut 
out the cores* and seeds. Fill ten lightning-glass jars with the pears, 
and pour over five quarts of syrup (No. 1339), covering them tightly the 

'same as for the peaches (No. 1340), placing them likewise in the saucepan, 
but boiling for fifteen minutes instead of ten. When lifted from the pan, 
proceed precisely as for the peaches. The best time to purchase the 
fruit is from August 25 to September 20. 

1342. Preserved Apples. — Select sixty medium-sized, fine,spund, ripe 
Newtown pippins, the best time for this being from October i to Decem- 
ber I. Peel and core them with a. corer, then cut them into quarters,' 
and divide them equally into ten glass jars as for peaches (No. 1340). 
Fill them up with the syrup at thirty degrees, then cover tightly, put 
them in the saucepan -exactly the same as for the peaches, and boil for 
fifteen minutes instead of ten. Take from off the fire, and finish the same 
as for the peaches, putting them away in the same temperature. 

1343. Preserved Egg-plnms.— Have two hundred medium sized egg- 
plums, ripe enough to break easily from the stones ; wash them tare- 
fully, drain, then divide them equally into the ten quart lightning-jars. 
Fill them up with the thirty-degree syrup (No. 1339), cover tightly, and 
arrange them in the pan precisely as for peaches (No. 1340). Boil them 
for eight minutes instead of ten, then take from the stove, and finish pre- 
paring them exactly as for the peaches. The best time to procure these 
is from August 5 to September i. 

1344. Preserved Green-gages.— Procure two hundred and fifty fine, 
ripe green-gages, selecting those which break easily from the stones ; 



380 TitE TABLE. 



wash them well in cold water, drain thoroughly, then divide therh equally 
into the ten patent glass jars, exactly as described for peaches (No. 1340). 
Fill up with five quarts of thirty-degree syrup (No. 1339), and finish pre- 
paring them the same as for peaches, but boiling them only for eight 
minutes instead of ten ; put them away the same as the other fruits. The 
best time to procure green-gages is from August i to September i. 

1345. Preserved Strawberries. — Always purchase the berries from 
June 7 to July 20, when residing in New York, Have fully the 
equivalent of ten quart^ of well-picked and thoroughly washed, ripe, 
sound, and perfect strawberries, drain them well. To have these well 
selected it will doubtless require twenty-two to tWenty-five quart baskets 
of unpicked fruit. When well drained, fill the ten quart lightning-glass 
jars with the berries, and pour in the thirty-degree syrup (No. 1339), but 
using it hot instead of cold. Cover them tightly, and proceed precisely 
the same as for peaches (No. 1340), only boiling them five minutes instead 
of ten, and putting them away the same. 

1346. Preserved Raspberries. — Have ready the equivalent of ten 
quarts of fine, ripe, solid, well-washed, and thoroughly drained raspber- 
ries ; sixteen quart baskets will be about the necessary quantity to pur- 
chase. When ready, fill up the ten lightning-glass jars, and proceed to 
prepare them as explained for peaches (No. 1340), the only exception 
being that they must be boiled five minutes instead of ten. The proper 
time to obtain the berries is from July 10 to July 20. 

1347. Preserved Cherries. — Purchase twenty-five pounds of fine, 
sound, ripe, white wax cherries ; pick off the stems neatly, and should 
there be any unripe or spoilt ones among them, throw them away, as' 
they would likely ruin the rest. When finished, there should be about 
twenty pounds of sound cherries suitable for preserving. Have ready 
ten quart lightning-glass jars, same as for the peaches (No. 1340); divide 
the picked cherries evenly into them, and fill up with the thirty-degree 
syrup (No. 1339). Cover them tightly and carefully, then arrange them 
in a large saucepan precisely the same as the peaches, and finish them 
exactly as described in that number, boiling them for the same -length of 
time. June 15 to July 1 is the best time to obtain the fruit. 

1348. How to Boast Coffee. — If practicable, procure a small family 
coffee-roaster. Have thr^e quarters of a pound of Java, mixed with u 
quarter of a pound of Mocha, place it in the roaster, and taking one of the 
lids from off the stove, put the roaster on a moderate fire, and turn the 
small handle constantly and slowly until the coffee becomes a good brown 
cdlor; for this it should take about twenty-five minutes; open the cover to 
see when it is done, then transfer it to an earthen jar, cover it tightly, and 
use when needed; or, a more simple way, and even more effectual, is to 
take a tin baking-dish, butter well the bottom; and placing the same 
quantity of coffee therein, put it in a moderate oven to let get a good 
golden color; twenty minutes will suffice for this, being careful to toss it 
frequently with a wooden spoon, then remove to an earthen jar., and cover 
it well. 



DESSERTS. -igl 



Roasting one's own coffee is a sure way of having it always fresh; 
besides, it retains its full flavor; but care must also be taken to purchase 
coffee from a responsible, first-class dealer. 

1349. How to Make Black Coffee.— Take six light tablespoonfuls of 
coffee-beans from the jar (No. 1348); grind them in a mill, neither too 
coarse nor too fine. Have a well-cleaned French coffee-pot, put the coffee 
on the filter, with the small strainer over, then pour on a pint and a half 
of boiling water, little by little, recollecting, at the same time, that too 
much care cannot be taken to impress on those making the coffee, the 
necessity of having the water boiling thoroughly, otherwise it were as 
useless to attempt the feat as to try and raise musk-melons at the North 
■Pole, notwithstanding that the coffee be of the very first quality. When 
all the water is consumed put on the cover, and let infuse slightly, but on 
no account must it boil again; then serve in six after-dinner cups. Coffee 
should never be prepared more than five minutes before the time to serve. 

1350. Caf6 Noir k I'Alexander the Great. — Put in an earthen pot on 
the hot range three pints of cold water; when boiling, immediately add 
four and a half ounces of freshly ground coffee, and as soon as the coffee 
has been added, put the pot on the corner of the stove to rest for three 
minutes. Have a piece of hot, red (very red), charcoal the size of a small 
banana, plunge it into the coffee. (If no charcoal at hand, a piece of red 
stove-coal will answer). Let rest again for three minutes ; then you will see 
a heavy foam appearing at the surface of the coffee , thoroughly skim it off 
with a skimmer. Then carefully and gently pour it into a hot coffee-pot, 
and send to the table with six small, hot demi-tasses; accompanied with 
six ponies of old Renauldt cognac. 

I would recommend that, after the scum has been removed, the coffee 
should be handled as gently as possible, so that all undesirable elements 
will remain at the bottom. 

1351. Cafe au Lait (Coffee with Milk). — Have a clean French coffee- 
filter ready on the hot range ; place in it four and a half ounces of freshly 
ground coffee, as for No. 1349; then gradually pour over it, all around, 
half a pint of boiling water; let rest for three minutes, then gradually 
pour over two pints and a half more of boiling water (taking special care 
that, under no circumstances, should it be allowed to boil again after the 
water has been poured over). When' all dripped down, pour it into a hot 
coffee-pot. Take three pints of good, freshly and thoroughly heated milk 
(but do not boil it), pour it into a hot pitcher, send to the table with six 
hot cups h cafd au lait, pouring into each cup half coffee and half milk. 

1352. Crf6 an Lait Si la St. Gottardo. — Place in an earthen pot on the 
hot range two quarts of very fresh milk, and let it heat until near the boiling- 
point, then immediately add two and a half ounces of fresh, finely ground 
coffee (No. 1349). Shuffle the pot in contrary directions until it comes to 
a boil; then let it rest for three minutes. 

Strain it through a clean napkin into a hot serving-pitcher, and serve 
with six caf6-au-lait cups. 

1353. CaK Glac6 ^£ced Coffee).— Prppare one quart of coffee as for 



382 THE TABLE. 



No. 1349, and also one quart of thoroughly heated milk (not boiled). 
Pour both coffee and milk into a small ice-cream freezer. Sweeten with 
three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; tightly cover the freezer, place 
it in a tub containing broken ice and rock-salt a little higher than 'the 
height of the coffee, then sharply turn it by the handle of the cover, in 
different directions, for five or six minutes; neatly wipe the cover of the 
freezer all around to avoid that any ice should fall in; and with the aid of 
a ladle pour it into a pitcher, and serve with six coffee-glasses, and 
powdered sugar separately. 

1354. Th6 (Tea). — Place in a tea-pot three heaped tablespobnfuls, or 
one and a half ounces, of the best English-breakfast X.e.a., purchased from a 
responsible dealer. Pour over five pints of boiling water. See to it that 
the water is boiling, else, even with the best quality of tea, you will never 
succeed to have it made to perfection. Let infuse for five minutes (but 
do not boil again), then send to the table with a pint of cold milk, or a 
pint of sweet cream. 

Th6 Glac6 (Iced Tea). — Prepare the same quantity of tea the same as 
above, pour into an ice-cream freezer, sweeten, and proceed the same as 
for iced coffee (No. 1353), (omitting the milk); pour it into a cold pitcher, 
and send to the table with six coffee-glasses, six slices of sound lemon, and 
powdered sugar separately. 

1355. Th6 Jlla Busse (Russian Tea). — Place in a tea-pot three heaped 
tablespoonfuls of English-breakfast tea; pour over a little boiling water, . 
just sufficient to cover the tea, about two tablespoonfuls; let infuse for 
one minute, then draw the water out, but do not use it. Pour in half a 
pony of good old Jamaica rum and three pints of boiling water; let infuse 
for four minutes, and then serve in cup with a decanter of old Jamaica 
rum separately, thin slices of lemon, and powdered sugar. 

This is the old Russian style. Later fashion is to flavor it with a little 
^vanilla flavor and a few drops of lemon juice. 

1356. How to Make Chocolate. — Select three quarters of a pound of 
good chocolate (Maillard's is preferable), break it into pieces, and put 
them in a saucepan on the stove with half a pint of boiling water ; stir 
well with a wooden spoon, and when the chocolate is thoroughly dis- 
solved pour one quart of boiling water over, using a quart of milk instead 
of the water when chocolate and milk is desired. Let it cook well for ten 
minutes, then serve. 

1357. Chocolat an Lait !l la George Washington. — Have a stone pot 
on the hot range with half a pint of cold water. Break in six tablets of 
one ounce each of Maillard's chocolate, sharply mix with a very clean 
wooden spoon or spatula until it is thoroughly dissolved ; then add two 
quarts of good cold milk, thoroughly heat until it comes to a boil, mixing 
lightly with the wooden spoon meanwhile. Pour it into a hot pitcher, 
and send to the table with cups and powdered sugar separately. 

A pinch of salt represents 205 grains, or a tablespoonful. 

Half a pinch of pepper represents 38 grains, or a teaspoonful. • 

A third of apinch of nutmeg represents 13 grains, or half a teaspoonful.

SUPPLEMENT. 



1338. Lobster & la Bashmore. — Select three fine, fresh lobsters, each 
weighing two pounds; boil them in salted water for ten minutes, then 
take them out and put to cool for eighteen minutes. Pick out all the 
meat, leaving the main body-shells intact for further use. Mince up the 
tail-parts, coral, and claws into pieces a quarter of an inch thick by three 
quarters of an inch wide. Put a sautoire containing half an ounce of fresh 
butter on the hot stove; chop uj very fine one good-sized, sound shallot, 
add it to the butter in the pan, also the minced lobster, and season with a 
light pinch of salt, a light saltspoonful of cayenne pepper, and half a 
glassful of good white wine; let the whole reduce for ten minutes, stirring 
it meanwhile with a wooden spoon. Add one tablespoonful of tomato 
sauce (No. 205), four tablespoonfuls of Espagnole sauce (No. 151), and 
six mushroom-stalks chopped up very fine. Let cook well for ten minutes 

, longer, then set the sautoire on the corner of the stove to keep warm. 
Take the three main shells of the lobsters, split them evenly in two, 
lengthwise, pare the ends off neatly, wash them thoroughly, and wipe 
them dry. These shells should not be longer than four and a half inches. 
Fill the six shells with the prepared lobster, lay two mushroom heads on 
top of each, put them on a tin plate and pour over the remainder of the 
sauce in the sautoire. Set them in the hot oven to bake for five minutes, 
then remove and dress them on a hot dish with a folded napkin, and send 
to the table. 

1339. Eaw Hamburg' Steak. — Chop up two pounds of beef the same 
as for cooked Hamburg steak (No. 526), only selecting more tender pieces, 
and return it to the machine two or three times so as to have it finer. 
Season with one large pinch of salt, half a pinch of pepper, and the third 
of a pinch of nutmeg. Place the meat on a dish, divide it into six small, 
flattened steaks, and throw a raw egg yolk over each one; garnish with 
two shallots, one tablespoonful of parsley, the same quantity of capers, 
and three anchovies, all finely minced, and arranged in clusters around the 
dish. 

1360. Mignons of Lamb, Sauce B^amaise. — Procure a fine, tender leg 

of lamb, bone it with a sharp knife so as to detach the meat from the 
knuckle, beginning from the hip-side downwards. Cut out from this six 
■ even pieces or steaks, one inch thick by two and a half in diameter, pare 
them nicely, and with a small, keen knife remove any sinews that are 
liable to adhere to the meat. Lay them on a cold dish, and season with a 
good pinch of salt and a light pinch of pepper, and roll them well, so that 



584 tHE TABLE. 



the seasoning be equally distributed. Put half an ounce of good butter 
in a frying-pan, set it on a brisk fire, and add the pieces, or mignons, im- 
mediately, being careful that they do not lay one on top of the other, and 
cook them very briskly for two and a half minutes on each side. Prepare 
half a pint of B6arnaise sauce (No, 166), pour it on a hot serving-dish, 
dress the six mignons nicely over, one overlapping the other, and send to 
the table immediately. 

Any lamb that may be left over after cutting off the mignons can be 
utilized for minced lamb, soup, or any other purpose desired. 

1361. Hind-quarter of Spring' Lamb. — Procure a medium-sized, fine, 
white hind-quarter of lamb ; pare it neatly, trim the small handle-bone, 
and fold the flank over the ribs, to prevent them being overdone; that 
means that the leg and ribs will be equally cooked the same length of 
time. Tie it well together, then season with one and a half pinches of, 
salt divided evenly, and envelop it well in its caul or leaf-fat ; lay it in a 
roasting-pan, pouring in one tablespoonjul of broth or water, then place 
it in a moderate oven, and let roast for one hour, basting it occasionally 
with its own dripping. Take it from the oven, remove the caul, untie, 
and dress it on a hot dish, adjusting a neat paper ruffle to the handle- 
bone. Skim the fat from off the gravy, strain the latter over the lamb, 
and serve. ' 

1362. Cliicken, Saute h. la Ch. C. DeLtaonico. — Select from a good 
poultry-dealer two fine, tender Philadelphia spring-chickens weighing, 
two pounds each. Singe them over a little alcohol poured onto a plate, 
draw the entrails, wash well the interiors, then wipe them dry with a 
clean cloth. Cut each chicken into six pieces, place them in a sautoire 
with two tablespoonfuls of sweet oil, season with a good pinch of salt and 
one pinch of pepper, then set the sautoire on a very brisk fire, and let 
cook until the pieces assume a good, light brown color (ten minutes will 
suffice), stirring them lightly in the meanVf hile. Chop up very fine one 
sound shallot ; cut one green pepper into small, dice-shaped pieces, also 
the end part only of a medium-sized, peeled .carrot ; place all these with 
the chickens, and let cook together for one minute and a half, then add 
one glassful of good white wine, and let the liquid reduce to one-half) 
which will take ten minutes on a brisk fire, stirring it occasionally. Now 
add one gill of Espagnole sauce (No. 151), a tablespoonful of tomato 
sauce (No. 205), the juice of a good-sized, very sound lemon, and a quar- 
ter of an ounce of fresh butter ; let all cook for ten minutes longer, stir- 
ring it lightly with a spoon. Plunge three canned artichoke-bottoms into 
very hot water, lift them up immediately with a skimmer, wipe them 
thoroughly dry with a napkin, then cut each one into four quarters ; slice 
three medium-sized truffles very fine, and add all these to the chickens 
two minutes before serving. Dress the chickens and sauce on a very 
hot serving-dish, adjust paper ruffles to the ends of the four legs ; gar- 
nish the dish artistically with the artichokes star-shaped. Place a slice of 
truffle on the centre of each artichoke, and a very small, round slice of 
Spanish sweet pepper on top of each truffle, and send to the table very hot. 



SUPPLEMENT. 385 



1363. Chicken, Sant^ ^ la Banhofer. — Select two fine, tender chickens 
weighing two pounds each ; singe them well, draw the entrails, wash 
thoroughly, and wipe very dry; then cut each chicken into six pieces, and 
season them with a good pinch of salt and a light pinch of pepper. Place 
the pieces of chicken in a sautoire with three quarters of an ounce of 
good butter and half a tablespoonful of sweet oil, and set it on a very 
hot stove. Chop up one shallot very fine, and one sound, green pepper 
cut in small, dice-shaped pieces ; when the chickens are of a light brown 
color, add the shallot and pepper, and stir well for one minute; then add 
a wine-glassful of good white wine, and let reduce to one quarter, which 
will take six minutes. Pour in one gill of tomato sauce (No. 205) and one 
and a half gills of Espagnole sauce (No. 151), and let cook rather slowly 
for ten minutes longer, stirring it occasionally. Dress the chickens and 
sauce on a very hot serving-dish, adjust paper ruflSes on the ends of 
the four legs, and decorate the dish with the following garnishing : take 
six canned artichoke-bottoms, spread a tablespoonful of Duxelle (No. 215) 
in the centre of each one ; empty the interiors of six fine, sound, medium- 
sized green peppers, cooked in the oven for five minutes, stufif them with 
Duxelle garnishing (No. 189), and arrange them on top of the artichokes, 
their thin part uppermost, so as to give them a pyramidal shape; then 
lay them on a buttered tin plate or dish, and set them in a slow oven to 
bake for five minutes ; remove them, but while they are baking cut out 
six round pieces of fresh bread, half an inch thick by two and a. half 
inches in diameter ; place them on a hot stove in a frying-pan with half 
a tablespoonful of butter, and let get a light brown color for two minutes. 
Arrange the six artichokes and peppers on top of the pieces of bread, 
garnish the dish nicely, and send to the table at once. 

1364. Filets Mignons & la Lorillard. — After preparing six timbales 
as described below, and when removed from the oven, have ready six 
fine filets mignons as for No. 509, and serve with the following garnish- 
ing and sauce: take six small timbale-molds, measuring one and three 
quarter inches in diameter and two inches deep ; butter well the insides, 
and set them in the ice-box to get thoroughly cold. Have one medium- 
sized, cooked carrot, also one cooked turnip; cut them both with a tube a 
quarter of an inch in diameter by one inch long ; have also half a. 
medium-sized, fine, white cabbage, and trim the outer leaves neatly. Put 
into a stewpan one ounce of salt pork cut into small dice-shaped pieces; 
add the cabbage, and season with half a pinch of pepper ; set the pan on a. 
rather slow fire, cover it tightly, and let cook slowly for thirty minutes, 
without removing the lid ; during this time decorate the six cold timbales 
by laying a slice of truffle, half an inch in diameter, at the bottom of each, 
and just in the centre, and with the aid of a larding-needle arrange a row 
of cooked green peas around this, then decorate half the interior of each 
timbale with half the prepared carrots and turnips, using the utmost care, 
and keeping thfm inclining slightly toward the right, and the other half 
inclining toward the left. Fill up the timbales with the cooked cabbage, 
•using a spoon to press it in gently, so that they are filled entirely as far 
25 



386 THE TABLE. 



as the top. Put thera on a roasting-pan, filling it with hot water to half 
the height of the timbales, then place them in a hot oven, and heat from 
three and a half to four minutes. Take them from the oven, and leave 
the pan on the corner of the stove to keep warm. Cut an oval-shaped 
slice from an American loaf of bread, one inch in thickness, pare the edgps 
neatly, then butter it lightly, and place it in the ovfn on a tin plate to get 
a light brown color; two minutes will be sufficient for this; lay it on a 
very hot dish, and dress the six filets mignons on top ojf the bread 
croustade, each one lengthwise and slightly overlapping one another, and 
so on until all are used. Pour over the mignons half a pint of hot Colbert 
sauce (No. igo), to which add whatever parings or pieces of truflle 
remain, one minute before using; then with a towel remove the timbales 
from the pan, one after the other, turn them upside down, unmold, and 
with these decorate the dish, placing one at each end and two on each 
side, then send to the table immediately. 

It would be advisable to prepare and cook the fillets after the timbales 
are removed from the oven. 

1365. Flageolets Sautes au Beurre. — Take three quarters of a quart 
can of fine, French flageolet beans, parboil them in boiling and lightly 
salted water for one and a half minutes, then drain them on a colander, 
and place them immediately in a saucepan on the hot stove with an ounce 
of good butter ; season with a teaspoonful of salt, and shuffle lightly 
with a wooden spoon while cooking for three minutes, and when serving, 
add half a teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley. Dress them on a hot 
dish, and serve. 

1366. Eggs k la Post. — Wash and scrape neatly one good-sized, sound 
carrot, then, with a vegetable-scoop, scoop out twelve round pieces; place 
thera in a sautoire with one gill of white broth (No. gg), and a teaspoon- 
ful of good butter. Cook them on the hot range for twenty minutes. 

Place twelve fine, sound, roasted, and shelled Italian chestnuts 
into the sautoire with the carrots, let come to a boil. Remove all the 
skin from two uncooked sausages. Make twelve equal balls out of it, 
place on a tin plate, and bake in the hot oven four minutes. Remove,, and 
add them to the carrots and chestnuts. Season with a light pinch of salt 
and the third of a saltspoonful of red pepper; add one gill of Madeira sauce 
(No. 185). Cook for two minutes longer. Have a silver dish suflSciently 
large to contain twelve eggs so that they do not touch one another. 
Place in the centre of the dish half a pint of hot purfee of chestnuts (No. 
131), then arrange twelve fried eggs over the purSe prepared the same 
as in No. 412. Carefully and equally divide in clusters around the dish, 
the carrots, chestnuts, and sausage balls, then pour the sauce around the 
eggs with a spoon, but none over the eggs. Place on top of each egg 
one thin slice of truffle cut with a tube. Place in the hot oven to heat for 
one minute. Take from out the oven, and serve. 

1367. Oysters Fried k la Arthur Snllivan. — Carefully open thirty 
large, fine, fresh box-oysters; place them in a saucepan with their own 
juice, season with the third of a saltspoonful of red pepper, adding half a. 



SUPPLEMENT. 387 

medium-sized fine, sound lemon, cut into thin slices, one sprig of thyme, 
a small bay-leaf, and a branch of well-washed parsley. Place on the hot 
range, and heat up very fast without boiling, for which, on a very brisk 
fire, it should be done in one minute and a quarter; then place the whple 
in an earthen bowl to cool. 

Beat up one raw egg in a bowl with one gill of cold milk, seasoned 
with a light pinch of pepper and a light pinch of salt; steep the oysters in 
this, one by one, then lightly roll them in cracker-dust; give them a nice 
even shape in the palm of the hand, and lay them on a dish. Heat up 
thoroughly in a frying-pan on the hot range one gill of clarified butter 
and half a gill of olive oil (it must be very hot before placing in the 
oysters), and fry them for one minute on each side. Remove them with 
a skimmer, dress on a hot dish with a folded napkin, and serve with the 
following sauce separately: 

Strain the juice of the oysters into a saucepan, and reduce it to one 
half on the hot range, with half a saltspoonful of red pepper, adding also 
the juice of half a sound lemon and a gill of sauce Espagnole (No. 151). 
Cook for three minutes, add a teaspoonful of chopped chives, pour it into 
a sauce-bowl, and send to the table. 

1368. Lobster Salad h, la Boardman. — Split lengthwise two very fine 
medium-sized, freshly boiled, and cooled lobsters; pick all the meat out 
from the shells, as well as from the cracked claws, suppress both intes- 
tines and pouch. Cut the meat into very small, equal, square pieces, and 
place them in a salad-bowl. Finely chop up, as fine as hashed potatoes, 
three hard-boiled eggs; add them to the lobster. Peel and chop, also very 
fine, two small, sound shallots, and add to the lobster, with one and a. half 
teaspoonfuls of very fine freshly chopped chives and one and a half tea- 
spoonfuls of finely chopped parsley. Chop also, very fine, one root of 
thoroughly pared and well-cleaned sound celery (using nothing but the 
perfect white), add it to the lobster. Season with a light tablespoonful 
and. a half of salt, a teaspoonful and a half of fresh, finely crushed white 
pepper, half a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, -0. tablespoonful and 
a half of olive oil, two tablespoonfuls of very good white vinegar. Mix 
well, then add three tablespoonfuls of freshly made mayonnaise sauce 
(No. 206). Gently but thoroughly mix the whole well together; wipe 
neatly the edges of the salad-bowl with a napkin. Plant right in the 
centre a branch of parsley-greens, and. send to the table. 

1369. Game Pie k la leri P. Morton.— Take one fine partridge, one 
grouse, and one medium-sized rabbit ; pick, draw, and singe well. Thor 
oughly bone them. Place the fillets in a saucepan with one tablespoonful 
of clarified butter. Season with one pinch of salt, half a pinch of pepper, 
and a quarter of a pinch of thyme. Cook on a brisk fire for one minute 
on each side ; then add half a glassful of good Madeira wine, and reduce 
to one half, which will take five minutes. Place in a bowl and let thor- 
oughly cool. Chop up the bones into fine pieces ; place them in a sauce- 
pan with one medium-sized, sound onion cut into slices, a small carrot 
cut the same, one bay-leaf, three cloves, twelve whole peppers, and a

blade of thyme. Cook all together with one ounce of butter until it has 
obtained a light brown color ; then add one glassful of Madeira wine, 
half a medium-sized, sound lemon cut in slices, one quart of white broth 
(No. 99), and two ounces of gelatine. Let cook one hour. Then strain 
through a napkin or a fine sieve into a. china bowl, and lay aside to thor- 
oughly cool. Chop up very fine a quarter of a pound of lean, raw veal, 
a quarter of a pound of fresh pork, and six ounces of larding-pork. Sea- 
son with one good pinch of salt and half a pinch of pepper. Cut into dice- 
shaped pieces eight truffles, three ounces of cooked smoked beef-tongde ; 
mix well together, and it will be ready for use. Knead well together, on 
a. marble table, wooden boqrd, or in a vessel, half a pound of flour with 
four ounces of butter, then gradually add a gill of cold water, mixing well 
until it is a perfect dough, for five minutes at least without ceasing. Then 
place it in a. cool place, and let rest ten minutes before using. Lightly 
butter the interior of an oval-shaped mold ten inches in length, six inches 
wide, and four and a half high. Place the mold in an iron roasting-pan. 
Roll out three quarters of the dough to one quarter of an inch thick, and 
with it evenly line the inside of the mold, taking special care not to make 
any holes in the dough. Cut some very thin slices of larding-pork, and line 
the dough all around with it. Then place one layer of the forcemeat and 
one layer of the game, and so on, until all is used. Make a hole with a 
teaspoon right in the centre down to half the depth of the patty (p&t6). 
Roll out the other quarter of dough to the same thickness, quarter of an 
inch ; cut a, cover out oval-shaped, and with it cover the p&t6, making a 
small hole in the centre to connect with the other. Decorate the surface 
with leaves made out of the dough, glaze it with the yolk of one fresh 
egg and half a gill of cold water. Place in a moderate oven to cook for 
two hours. Remove from the oven. Put away in the ice-box for six 
hours. 

1370. Plombiere h la Hamilton.— Beat up one and a half pints of 
sweet cream as in No. 1 254. Let it rest for half an hour. Neatly pick 
one and a half pints of sound, ripe strawberries ; carefully wash them in 
cold water, then drain them on a colander. Transfer the whipped cream 
into another vessel with a skimmer. Briskly beat the cream again for 
two minutes. Mix in three ounces of powdered sugar, one teaspoonful of ■ 
vanilla flavor, and half a gill of cognac. Mix the whole well together for 
one minute longer. Remove the wire whip, add the prepared strawber- 
ries, and with the aid of a wooden spoon gently mix for one minute. 
Pour the preparation into a well-cleaned, two-quart freezer, cover, and 
lay it into a pail ; fill the pail all around with broken ice (but no rock- 
salt), and let freeze for one hour. Have a fruit-stand ready, then with an 
ice-cream spoon dress the plombifere on the stand, giving a dome shape, 
and immediately send to the table. 

The above majces a delicious dessert, also, when served without being 
frozen. 

1371. Tntti-frntti h. la Gen. Harrison.— Line the interior of a three- 
pint melon-form with a pint of vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271). Cut four 



SUPPLEMENT. . 389 

ounces of candied apricots into small pieces, also four ounces of candied 
cherries into halves. Mix these together. Evenly spread half the quan- 
tity of the fruits all around the ice-cream in the form. Carefully arrange 
a pint of raspberry water-ice (No, 1281) evenly around the fruits, Sfjread 
the balance of the fruits all around the water-ice ; then fill the form with 
a pint of pistache ice-cream (No. 1275). Tightly cover the form. Lay it 
in a pail with a layer ot broken ice and rock-salt at the bottom, and then 
fill up to the surface with the same. Let freeze for one and a half hours. 
Unmold the tutti-frutti ; dress on a glass stand, and serve with the fol- 
lowing sauce : put in a vessel a pint of whipped cream (No. 1254) with 
two ounces of powdered sugar and a gill of maraschino. Beat the whole 
well together for two minutes. Pour it over the tutti-frutti, and immedi- 
ately send to the table. 

1372. Frogs' Legs k la Merrill. — Neatly pare off the claws of half a 
pound of very fine, fat, fresh frogs' legs. Cut them into pieces at each 
joint. Place them in a saucepan on the hot reinge, with half an ounce of 
very good butter. Season with one pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful 
of red pepper. Cook on a brisk fire for five minutes, then add a wine- 
glassful of Madeira wine, with two finely minced truffles; reduce for three 
minutes. Crack into a bowl three egg yolks, add to it half a pint of 
sweet cream, beat well together one minute, pour it into the pan with the 
frogs, then gently shuffle the pan in opposite directions until the sauce 
thickens, which will take two minutes and a half. Pour into a hot soup- 
tureen, and serve. 

1373. Strawberries. — After selecting and thoroughly washing the 
berries, fill the cans and cover with a twenty-five-degree syrup, seal up, 
and cook five minutes. Open the vent, to let hot air out, about one min- 
ute, then close the vent and put away. The best berries are in market 
between June 7 and 14. 

1374. Pineapple. — The best pineapples (the sugar-loaf) come to' 
market between June 15 and July 15. After selecting the ripest fruit, 
pare and cut all the eyes out, take the core out, cut in slices, and fill 
cans ; cover with a twenty-five-degree sVrup ; seal up and cook twenty 
minutes. Open vent to let hot air out, close, and put away. 

1375. Asparagus. — The best asparagus for canning is the Colossal, 
from Monmouth County, New Jersey, and the best time from May 12 
to June 12. After selecting the large, perfect spears, wash thoroughly, 
then scald about ten minutes, and after filling the cans full, cover with a 
light salt water, and seal the cans up, leaving the vent open; then cook- 
ten minutes ; then close the vent and cook two and one half hours. Open 
vent to let the gas out, and close it again, 

1376. Bhnbarb, or Pie-plant.— After jjeeling and cutting the rhubarb 
in pieces about one inch long, fill cans and cover with a light syrup, seal 
up, and boil five minutes ; open vent to let the air out, close, and put 
away. The best time is from May 20 to June i. 

1377. Cherries. — The best cherry, the white Ox-heart, ripens between 
June 20 and July i. Select the fruit, fill cans, and cover with a twenty- 



39© THE TABLE. 



five-degree syrup, seal up, cook fifteen minutes, open Vent, close, and 
put away. 

1378. Gooseberries. — Select the berries when green, between June 
17 and July i. After filling the cans, cover with a light syrup, seal up,' 
and bathe five minutes, open vent, close, and put away. 

1379. Cnrrant Jelly. — The best jelly can only be made before the cur- 
rants are fully ripe — between June 25 and July 3. After scalding the 
currants well, press them through a flannel bag, and while the juice is 
hot, boil six or seven pounds of the best crushed sugar with one gallon of 
juice, watching closely until it attains the proper consistency; then pour 
in molds to cool. 

Another way to make a very delicate jelly is to boil one gallon of juice 
about ten minutes, and while boiling hot stir in eight pounds of granulated 
sugar, and keep stirring until all dissolved, then pour into molds. 

1380. Raspberries. — The best time is between July 5 and 15, and pro- 
ceed same as strawberries. 

1381. Blackberries and Whortleberries between July 15 and August 
15. After carefully washing the berries, put on any degree of syrup you 
wish, as this fruit will make pies pr do for the table. Seal up, and cook 
eight minutes; open vent, close, and put away. 

1382. Peas, Corn, and Lima Beans are so hard to keep that it is im- 
possible for a family to put them up. They require a greater heat than 
boiling water, and have to be cooked in a super-heated steam chest. 

1383. Egg-plnms and Green-gages are best when nearly ripe— be- 
tween August 15 and September i. After filling cans cover with a 
twenty-five-degree syrup and cook ten minutes, then open the vents, close 
and put away. 

1384. Tomatoes. — Between August 15 and September 15, select 
thoroughly ripe tomatoes, scald them about two minutes in hot watei', so 
that the skin will peel off very thin to leave the perfect shape of the fruit ; 
then fill the cans as full as you can press them in; seal them and cook 
twenty minutes, then put away. 

1385. Peaches and Bartlett Pears. — Last of August to last of Septem- 
ber, select ripe fruit; pare carefully; fill cans and cover with a twenty-five- 
degree syrup; seal up, cook twenty minutes, then open vent, close and 
put away. 

1386. String Beans are best in October. Select the small refugee 
beans; after taking strings off. wash and scald well; then fill cans with 
whole beans, and cover with a light brine. Seal up; cook one half hour, 
then open vent, close again, and Cook three fourths of an hour more, then 
put away. 

1387. Apples. — Newtown pippins are the best about November 15. 
Pare and quarter; take cores out; then fill cans and cover with any 
strength syrup required. Seal up, and cook five minutes, open vent, 
close and put away. 

Six pounds of the best crushed sugar to a gallon of water will make 
a syrup of twenty to twenty-five degrees. 



SUPPLEMENT.

they are cooked, lightly devil them, and then gently broil again for half 
a minute on each side. 

Place in a small saucepan on the hot range one medium-sized, sound, 
peeled, and finely chopped shallot, with a tablespoonful of good butter; 
cook for one minute, then add two chopped mushrooms, one chopped

over it, decorate the dish with six slices of broiled bacon (No. 754), six 
thin half slices of lemon; arrange six slices of truffles in the centre of the 
slices of lemon, and serve very hot. 

1391. Mdzagran & la General Bngeaa. — This will be found a superior 
and pleasantly stimulating summer beverage for ladies, as well as for the 
sterner seX. 

Prepare the same quantity of coflEee as in No. 1349. Have six goblets 
half filled with clean ice, pour in the coffee, evenly divided ; add a pony 
of good cognac to each glass, mix thoroughly with a teaspoon, and serve. 



592 THE TABLE. 



The above is a delicious and healthful after-dinner summer drink, and 
is enjoyed in nearly all the large cities of Europe, especially by military 
men, who prefer it to the usual after-dinner demi-tasse, or " gloria," as 
they call it in Paris. 

The name is derived from the village of Mazagran, Province d'Oran, 
Algeria, famous for a long and heroic siege in 1840, wherein one hundred 
and twenty-three French soldiers were victorious against twelve thousand 
Arabs. 

1392. Mazagran a la General Dnfour. — The same as above, only sub- 
stituting a pony of Swiss kirsch instead of cognac. 

1393. Smelts k la Tan Volkenbnrgh. — Wash well, and thoroughly 
dry, eighteen fine, fresh Long Island smelts. Split them right along the 
backbone in the centre; remove the backbone of each. Season with a 
pinch of salt and half a pinch of pepper; sprinkle them with half an ounce 
of flour, then place them in a J>an with one ounce of good butter on the hot 
range; and fry for two minutes on each side, or until they obtain a good 
light brown color. Dress them on a hot dish; place in a pan one ounce of 
good butter, fry it until it becomes of a good nut-brown color; add to it a 
tablespoonful of vinegar, then pour over the smelts; decorate the dish all 
around with parsley-greens, and serve. 

1394. Tonidtoes ■with Eice k la Watson.— Wash in cold water six fine, 
red, sound, equal-sized tomatoes, wipe them dry, then cut off the top of 
each tomato (keeping them on a plate until needed); remove the seeds of 
the tomatoes with a vegetable-scoop. Season the inside of each with half 
a pinch of pepper and half a pinch of salt. • 

Place them in a well-buttered pan. Place two ounces of well-picked 
rice in a cup or in a dish, add to it one teaspoonful of melted butter, 
half a medium-sized, sound, peeled, and finely chopped shallot; season 
with half a pinch of salt only, mix all well together, then put into 
each tomato one teaspoonful of rice ; place the tops on as a cover, sprinkle 
a little clarified butter over, and then cover them with a well-buttered 
paper. Bake them in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. 

Thoroughly wash six large, fresh mushrooms. Cut off the stalks, chop 
up very fine half a sorund, peeled shallot, as well as the mushroom stalks, 
place ill a pan with a tablespoonful of good butter and two drops of lemon 
juice. Season with half a pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful of pepper.

room on top of each tomato, upside down, pour a little of the sauce over 
the six mushrooms, and the rest on the dish around the tomatoes; arrange 
a thin slice of truffle on top of each head of mushroom, and send to the 
table. 



UOW TO CAS VS. 393 



HOW TO CARVE. 



The art of cookery and carving is an old one. During the Roman 
Empire it was taught by professors in the schools, and had at that time 
attained a high standard. France leads all nations in the art of cooking 
and carving, although the United States is not far behind in this respect. 

Good cooking and carving go hand in hand. It is no trifle to prepare 
and cook a good dinner; but it is an easy matter to spoil the effect, if not 
the entire dinner, by negligent carving. 

The first and most important factor is a strong and very sharp knife. 

Chickens. — Lay the roasted chicken (of three to four pounds) on its 
side. Stick your fork into the legand'lift it up, meanwhile holding down 
firmly the rest of the chicken. Then cut through the joint on the back; 
pressing the joint between the leg and second joint, cut through. 
Stick your fork into the' wing so as not to interfere with the knife; cut 
through the joint and loosen the meat surrounding it; pull down with the 
fork and press firmly on the carcass with the knife. If done carefully, you 
can pull all the meat from the breast with the wing. Then cut each breast, 
crosswise, in half. Turn around, and proceed as in the first operation. 

Turkey. — Cut away theleg the same as with a chicken. The leg of a 
turkey being larger than that of a chicken, it would be advisable to cut 
into slices the leg and second joint. After the leg is cut off, stick your 
fork into the breast-bone; hold the fork firmly with the left hand; then,, 
with the sharp knife in your right hand, starting from the outside of the 
breast, proceed to cut, carefully, thin slices, until you reach the bone. 
Then turn, and proceed the same as before. 

Serve each person with a piece of the dark and a slice of the white meat. 

Should the turkey be stuffed, place a little of the stuffing on each plate. 
A capon, large chicken, or English pheasant should be carved the same way. 

Partridges. — In America only the breasts of the birds are generally 
eaten, the legs being strong and bitter. Stick your fork straight into the 
breast-bone; cut one slice from the outside breast; then cut close along- 
side of the breast-bone and around the wing, carefully pushyigall the meat 
from off both breasts, one after the other. 

Gronse. — The grouse is generally carved the same way as the partridge. 

Canvas-back Duck. — The " King of Birds." — The breast only is 
carved, served, and eaten. Stick the fork straight and firmly into the 
middle of the breast-bone. Commence from the neck down to the back, 
straight to the back-bone, and-around the back; then from the point of 
starting, around the collar-bone. Cut the joint from off the wing. Com- 
mence cutting again from the point of starting; carefully and gently 
carving off the whole breast, so that no meat remains. Proceed precisely 
the same with the other side. When finished, there will remain only the 
carcass. 



394 THE TABLE. 



Red-head, black-head, mallard, teal, &c., are carved the same as the 
canvas-back. 

Tame duck, duckling, goose, &c. , are carved as a chicken, unless they 
are over four or five pounds, then they should be carved the same as a 
turkey or a capon. 

For small birds, such as squab, snipe, plover, woodcock, &c. , no carv- 
ing is necessary, as they are generally served whole. 

Saddle of Mutton, Lamb, or Yenison should always be carved — 

especially for private families — lengthwise first, on both sides of the spinal 
bone, then crosswise downward. Special care should be taken to stick 
the fork right jn the centre of the saddle, and holding it firmly while carv- 
ing with a very sharp knife, and keepiflg as near the bone as possible, till 
down to the end on both sides. When all detached, cut it crosswise into 
small pieces of about half or three-quarters of an inch thick, and serve. 

Steak.— ^Sirloin steak can be carved in various ways — crosswise, 
lengthwise, in small or large pieces, as desired. 

When serving, the cut part should always be laid uppermost. I would 
suggest, though, carving it diagonally into six fine, even slices, till you 
reach the fat part. When carved this way it makes it look inviting, and 
has a beautiful effect. Always place a small piece of the fa-t on each plate 
when serving. 

Tenderloin, or Fillet. — Fillet is carved straight ( in as many pieces as 
desired, but when serving, the cut part should always be served the same 
as the sirloin, uppermost. 

Boast Beef. — As soon as the rib-beef is roasted to perfection, as men- 
tioned in No. 527, remove it from the hot oven, place it always on a hot 
dish, with the ribrbones downward ; should it be crusty on top, cut off 
just a little from the surface, which is generally so hard that often it is an 
impediment in cutting the slices to the desired perfection. Stick in the 
fork-tines lengthwise, on top of the roast, near the edge, in a slanting 
manner, so as to avoid pricking the lean part of the roast and the result- 
ing loss of juice or blood; hold firmly the fork with the left hand, and with 
a large, sharp knife in the right hand, carefully cut, in even, small slices 
a quarter of an inch thick, right down to the rib-bones; gently make a 
cut underneath, so as to have each slice separate from one another; 
then serve'. 

Roasted Leg of Mutton. — Jf , practicable, when carving a leg of mutton 
• a patent handle should be adjusted to the end bone, which would be a sub- 
stitute for the fork, and an avoidance of soiling the hands at the same time. 
Begin carving small, thin, even slices, about quarter of an inch in thick- 
ness, straight or diagonally down to the bone, till you come to the end 
bone, then lengthwise underneath to the end. On account of the much 
thinner meat on the other side of the leg, carve it diagonally, and serve 
one piece from each side. 

Boasted Leg of Lamb. — is to be carved exactly the same as the leg 
of mutton.

^ ]V[ K N U ^ 

FROM 

Central Africa. 



Through the courtesy of a gentleman who has for many years lived 
in Central Africa, and who has brought with him a young prince, son of 
one of the powerful chiefs of the Baaili tribe, to be educated in this 
country, the author is enabled to illustrate the habits and customs now in 
vogue in the Royal Kitchen there. 

As a rule, there is only one principal meal, which is eaten in the early 
part of the evening. It mostly consists of parrot-soup, roasted or stewed 
monkeys, alligator eggs (also well liked by Europeans) , and birds of every 
description. They also have moambo or palm-chops, and fish. A great 
delicacy, so considered by Europeans and natives alike, is elephant's 
feet and trunk. They have somewhat the taste of veal, and have a very 
delicious flavor. To prepare them they dig a hole, about five feet deep, 
in the sand, and build in it a large fire. After the sand is thoroughly 
heated, the fire is removed, leaving only the ashes in the hole. They 
place the trunk and feet in this hole, covering them with leaves, and 
afterward with hot sand; they remain there about two hours, when they 
are considered done. 

All carcasses of animals which are to be cooked, are placed on a block 
of wood, and pounded until every bone is broken, care being taken not to 
tear or bruise the skin. They are then boiled or roasted on an open wood- 
fire, in hot sand or ashes, without removing the hide or feathers. 

The cooking is of a very inferior grade; the only spices used being 
salt and pepper. 

The kitchen utensils consist of common earthen or wooden ware. 

Very little time is taken for setting or decorating the table; knives, 
forks, napkins, &c., &c., are dispensed with. 

All victuals are served in large wooden vessels. After the members of 
the chief's household and his guests have assembled, each person is sup- 
plied with a wooden spoon, and selects whatever he wishes out of the 
different vessels, using his hands in eating it. 

In the line of vegetables, they have also several dishes well liked by 
Europeans. N'gutti-N'sengo is a dish eaten all over Africa. It consists 
of egg-plant, small fish, somewhat like our sardines (N'sengo), and the 
roots of the cassava or manioca plant (called N'gutti), which have a 
knotty appearance, and often weigh as much as twenty pounds. 

As the latter contains poison, they soak the manioca in water for three 
to four days, to extract the poisonous substance. They are cut and 



414 ^-^-^ TABLE. 



sliced, adding small tomatoes. All is placed in a vessel with water, and 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and boiled. Moambo, or, as the European* 
call it, palm-chops, is also a favorite dish. The palm-nuts are first boiled 
in water, until the pulpy substance loosens from the pit. 

Then the shell, which contains a very delicious oil, is placed in a 
wooden mortar and crushed to obtain the oil. Then whatever the meal 
consists of, meat, fish, inussels, &c., all is put in a vessel, adding the oil 
and the pulpy part of the palm-nut, also red pepper and salt, and is boiled. 

Roast or boiled squash (Loenge) is generally eaten with it. 

Sweet potatoes (M'balla Benga) are more farinaceous, and sweeter than 
ours, but do not taste so good. They are boiled or roagted in the same 
way as we do here. 

.Bananas (Bitaebe) weigh about a half pound each, and are about fifteen 
inches long. When half ripe they are cut in slices, adding much salt and 
pepper, and are boiled in water. 

N'sensi is a little red bean, which is boiled in water without adding salt 
or pepper. 

Peanut bread (Chisulu): the peanuts are first roasted, then crushed. 
This mass is then rolled and put into the skin of a banana, adding a little 
pressure, forming it into a body. It readily retains this shape from the 
presence of the oily substance in the peanut.

As to the Chinese, at their formal dinners or feasts no menus are 
used. The bill of fare consists of an interminable list of dishes, and 
which has been arranged by the author in the form of a menu card. The 
tables are laden with such dishes as shark-fins, beche-de-mer fish, fish- 
soup, chicken-soup, duck-soup, rice, rice, rice, and tea, tea, tea, and tea ; 
not forgetting the edible birds' nests, candies, and cakes. One's appetite 
is almost taken away on entering a Chinese house at which a banquet is 
to be given— the effect of burning incense and other vile herbs. The 
Chinese can be extremely polite. Champagne is a favorite drink among 
Chinese officials at the Treaty Ports, and is always brought out when 
they have a foreign guest.

A most delicious sauce, called " Shoyu,'' which is the basis of Wor-

the repast the guests are served from time to time with " Saki," a pale 
liquor made from rice, and which tastes very much like sherry. It is 
served hot, and is a most insinuating tipple. In a large party you are 
expected to exchange cups and drink with every one present. The result 
is that, in nine cases out of ten, you leave the house just a " wee bit fu'," 
as they say in Scotland, Like the Chinese, no knives, forks, or napkins 
are used — " chop sticks " only. To smack your lips or belch during the 
feast is, strjatnge tp^ay of such a supremely polite people, not considered 
bad form.

In Corea Chinese fashions are very closely followed. Greasy messes 
and appetite-destroying smells are their most characteristic features. 
The food is always conveyed to the mouth by the aid of " chop sticks," 
and during the progress of a meal the mind becomes catered to by an 
animated conversation.

Among the Kanakas, the food eaten for breakfast, luncheon, and dinner 
is about the same, and consists chiefly of the native dish called " POI," 
which is eaten whenever they (the Kanakas) are hungry. 

"POI "'is made from a root called " Taro,'' and in shape and size 
resembles a raw beet, it has a dark skin, and the vegetable itself has a 
variety of colors — pink, gray, purple, and white. 

The "Taro " is cooked in t:he ground, after the manner of a " New 
England clam-bake ;" after obtaining the softness of a cooked potato it is 
peeled, and beaten with a large stone or iron, made for that purpose, into 
a pulp. It is then mixed with water until it forms the thickness of paste 
(and which makes very good paste, as it is often used for sticking bills, 
etc., when a theatrical company arrives), and after standing for a. ievf 
days, to allow it to ferment, it is ready to be eaten. 

The "Poi" is always eaten out of a "Calabash" (a large gourd 
about the size of a pumpkin), the natives always eating with their fingers, 
this being done by sticking the two fore-fingers into the " Calabash," 
giving it one or two twists, and dexterously turning it around in front of 
their faces, until it looks like a ball of "taffy on a stick" (no pun 
intended). 

"Taro" is sometimes cooked and eaten like potatoes and is consid- 
ered very wholesome^food. 

The next important dish is "Raw Fish" which are caught along the 
coast and eagerly eaten by the natives. Fish is also cooked in the 
ground, and' is served on large leaves about the size of palm-leaves, 
called " Ti " leaves. Raw meat, raw liver, and a fragrant sea-weed form 
delicate side-dishes. 

Coffee, within the last few years, has to a great extent been drunk as 
a beverage, but not so much as the Hawaiian tea, which tastes and smells 
like medicine. 

Vegetables are also eaten, but sparingly, comprising sweet potatoes, 
Irish potatoes, cabbages, etc. ' 

Fruit, the product of the Islands, is very much eaten and relished, 
such as guavas, mangoes, bananas, mountain-apples, oranges, etc. 

The Hawaiians when eating always sit on mats. All eat out of the 
same calabash. After eating, it is the custom to pass the pipe of friend- 
ship, which is a small pipe made from shark's teeth.
