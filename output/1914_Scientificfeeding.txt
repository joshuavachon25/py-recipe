INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO SECOND EDITION 

Before the manuscript for the first edition of "Scientific 
Feeding" went to the press, it was reviewed by several presi- 
dents of Mothers' Clubs and other women organizations; they 
realized that it would fill a long-felt want in the home and a 
large number of advance subscriptions were sent in. 

After publication the gratifying demand for this work neces- 
sitated the preparation of a second edition within a month.

INTRODUCTION 

HIS is a practical and hygienic cook book for all 
who consider life and health valuable. Intelligent 
homekeepers, nurses, managers of institutions and 
factories, all who are interested in furnishing the 
most nutritious food at the least cost, or wish to 
distribute such a work, will find this book worth its weight in 
gold. 

After twenty years of persistent study, combined with prac- 
cal work as nurse and physician in private and in institutions, 
beginning in Germany, I am able to-day to present this val- 
uable work, and hope that it may be placed in the hands of 
every home-maker in the country. It is designed for the pur- 
pose of modifying the cost of living and of eliminating, to 
some degree, the hardships and drudgeries of our women. It 
is excellent for school feeding, and presents the keynote to 
health and longevity, helping to prevent mental, physical, and 
moral diseases. 

The great facilities for research work in the modern labora- 
tory offer a wide field for the study of preventive medicine and 
hygiene. The world is beginning to recognize the fact that a 
large number of diseases are the result of wrong conditions. 



8 INTRODUCTION 

improper eating, drinking, sleeping, unsuitable work, excess 
of amusement, and wrong educational systems are to blame 
for a large number of germ diseases and chronic ailments. 

The body is the temple of the soul, therefore the laws of 
hygiene (concerning our internal and external body) are 
divine. Many of the orthodox teachings and divine laws in 
reference to hygiene, fasting, and feeding are a safe guide for 
the prevention of disease. 

It has been my object to present a practical and sane method 
of living, free from fads and the teachings of one-sided extrem- 
ists. All natural foods are wholesome, if properly combined, 
prepared, proportioned, and selected with care to agree with 
the temperament, environment, age and climatic conditions. I 
have devoted a special chapter to economical menus for people 
of moderate means, and have endeavored to show how it is 
possible to feed a family of five on a moderate sum, without 
injury to health. The amount of food and the proportions 
agree with what is demanded by modern standard dietaries. 

A large number of cook books have been written during the 
last one hundred years to tickle the palate. Much valuable 
time has been wasted and many innocent victims have paid 
the price for the sins of gluttony, caused by modern methods 
cf living. 

The most learned and advanced thinkers are turning their 
attention more and more to scientific dietetics. The question 
of feeding is one of the most important subjects our present 
generation has to deal with. It is my desire that this book 
may contribute to this cause, and that it may awaken thousands 
of mothers and daughters to appreciation of the dignity and 
importance of their life work. 



PREFACE 



The human body is a wonderfully complex and mysterious 
establishment, presided over by life. It is composed of the 
dust of the earth, organized by creative power. 

The elements composing the human body are : Oxygen, 
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, chlorine, sulphur, phosphorus, 
fluorine, calcium, natrium, magnesium, silicon, iron and potas- 
sium. 

Our bodies are maintained by food, air, light, activity, rest 
and sleep. 

The union of oxygen with one or more of these elements is 
called oxidation. If the process of oxidation within our bodies 
goes on rapidly we feel warm and energetic ; if it goes on 
slowly, the degree of heat and energy is less ; in fever there is 
rapid oxidation ; in people who suffer with chronic diseases 
there is incomplete and slow oxidation. 

In order to produce harmony between the elements in the 
body, it is not only necessary to breathe pure air, and eat 
wholesome foods, but it is equally important to have those 
food elements, which are taken into our body, selected in the 
r'ght quantity, quality and combination. It is further neces- 
sary to have them prepared in the mouth by mastication and 
in?alivation. If this is done, the chemical affinity or combining 
power of the foods is satisfied, and digestion, absorption, san- 
guification, circulation, oxidation, assimilation, excretion and 
Glorification will go on perfectly. 

In order to keep our bodies in perfect health, we must 
understand their laws. The structures and functions of the body 
are intimately connected, and one is dependent upon the other. 

Life at the beginning is a tiny cell ; as it multiplies into 
other cells, it forms blood vessels, nerves, muscles, bones, 
lungs, liver, brain, heart, and stomach, until the body is com- 
pleted. The growth of the body is from within, before and 
after birth. The natural food for the infant is mother's milk, 
the next best is the milk of a wet-nurse, whose child is about 



io PREFACE 

the same age as the one to be nursed. Artificial preparations 
of milk from a cow, goat or donkey is the next best. 

The appearance of the teeth indicates that the feeding of 
solid food can. be begun. The kind of food required for the 
child as well as for the adult differs with different individuals. 
A normal and healthy mother will be directed by her instincts, 
reason and judgment to choose the right food for herself as 
well as for her infant. 

An old saying goes, "God created foods, the devil created 
the cooks." A few thousand years ago, when the art of 
cooking was in its infancy, physicians and surgeons were not 
in such demand as to-day. The preparation of foods for the 
average household in those days consisted mainly of boiled 
cereals prepared with salt and water, boiled and roasted meats, 
and baked breads. Such articles, if eaten in proper combina- 
tion with raw fruits, greens, and nuts, will keep the appetite 
at the normal state. The principal victims of disease in those 
days were the kings, the idle rich and the very poor. Since 
civilization has progressed, and the rights of man are more 
equalized, the whole race is in danger of degeneration through 
the invention of fashionable and artificially prepared foods. 

In this age of refinement, our teeth, which were made to 
last as long as our bodies, begin to decay before we are ma- 
tured. Foods are ingested into our bodies instead of being 
digested. Public hygienists and technical bacteriologists work 
hard, trying to prevent such diseases as diphtheria, scarlet 
fever, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and many other infectious 
and epidemic diseases, resulting from unclean food and water, 
and imperfect sewage systems. 

Even with the purest of milk, meat, and water, we can make 
a filthy garbage can of our intestinal tract by the ingestion of 
foods which do not harmonize chemically, the result being 
decomposition. Right here we have all the dangers of modern 
diseases and pus formation, resulting in appendicitis, phlebitis, 
ovaritis, cancer, Bright's disease, and all the above mentioned 
diseases, without having to look further for the garbage can 
on the back porch or the sewage system in the yard. The 
waste products from our tables, and the excretions from our 
bodies would be less dangerous to health if the selection, com- 



PREFACE ii 

bination, and preparation of our food were more natural. The 
excretions of properly fed animals are not so dangerous to our 
health; why should ours be? 

The hygienic rules as taught by the orthodox Jew in refer- 
ence to the combination and preparation of foods are wise. 
He is not allowed to mix milk and meat, meat and fish, 
and many other articles of food which do not combine well 
chemically. The Jewish methods of killing animals and the 
preliminary preparations such as the watering and salting of 
meats before cooking are also more hygienic. They eliminate 
part of the toxins of the meat, which have been in close con- 
tact with the air. 

Since life and personal health are generally in charge of 
woman, the right place for every girl under eighteen or twenty 
years is at home or in. school. No young girl under this age 
should be allowed to enter a profession, workshop, or business 
college. An occupation which by long hours of work over- 
develops a certain set of muscles and nerves before maturity, 
will produce an abnormal development and an unstable tem- 
perament. Co-education at this age is also harmful, the result 
being premature development, and elopement marriages, or 
arrested sexual development and extreme independence, or 
marriage and continual suffering, owing to physical defects 
and lack of knowledge of the care of the human body, and of 
domestic science. 

Every woman is a born nurse. Ho\v valuable would it be, 
then, to give every young girl, beginning at the age of twelve, 
a rudimentary course in nursing and in the care of children ; 
in the art of selecting, combining, and preparing foods ; and in 
the art of housekeeping. An industrial high school course with 
such technical work as is suitable for woman's sensitive brain 
would develop her brain and body in every direction and make 
the future woman, a healthy mother of healthy offspring. 
Those muscles and nerve centers which have been well devel- 
oped during puberty will be the strongest throughout life. 

The store, the factory, the office, and the business college 
are no places for a girl under tw r enty years of age. If for 
some reason she has no desire to follow her natural calling in 



12 PREFACE 

life, there will be plenty of time to prepare herself for other 
work after the age of twenty. 

If a law could be enforced to compel every woman to pre- 
sent a certificate of health and maturity, and a diploma of 
qualification when applying for a marriage license, much un- 
necessary misery, disease, and many untimely deaths could be 
avoided. 

The feeding as well as the mental, moral and physical train- 
iny of children, is the natural profession for women. Children 
have in them all the possibilities for good and evil. Mistakes 
during this period will affect the child throughout its life. 
Thousands of infants and young children are killed every year 
by wrong feeding and environment. A large percentage of 
brilliant and exceptional children fill the jails and insane asy- 
lums. Idleness, stupidity, and criminal tendencies are diseases, 
and diseases can be avoided by right living. Children with 
hereditary weaknesses require double care and attention ; but 
remember the wonderful law of nature works always toward 
the normal ; the good tends to overcome the bad. 

If the brain of a child becomes starved by the use of sweet- 
meats, and clogged by the use of rich condiments and highly sea- 
soned food, or by an excess of starchy foods, there is always 
great danger, and more so, if the child is exceptionally bright 
and active. A large amount of arterial blood is sent to the 
brain, and if this blood contains much waste matter, the elim- 
inating organs will soon be overworked and all kinds of dis- 
eases are liable to follow, such as brain fever, softening and 
subluxation of bones, epilepsy, chorea, meningitis, paralysis, 
tuberculosis of the lungs, bones, and mesentery. 

Many young women who, through wrong food, environment 
and unsuitable educational systems, have dwarfed their bodies, 
find motherhood a great burden. They have to pay the penalty 
for the sin that is committed on them. Their children will 
not be so strong, and will have less resisting power, and their 
grandchildren, if there be any, will land in the institutions for 
the incurable, if the careless feeding and wrong habits are kept 
up by each succeeding generation. On the other hand, if the 
progress of degeneration is checked by right living, the work 
and time invested will be well repaid during one generation. 



PART ONE 



CHAPTER I. 

"THE BLOOD IS THE LIFE." 

Its Structure and Function Depend on the 
Building Material. 

Foods are substances which, when introduced into the sys- 
tem, supply the necessary material for growth, renewal and 
maintenance of the vital structures. Food is anything that 
nourishes. 

Foods must contain the same elements found in our bodies. 
The body requires a combination of different food elements in 
proper proportion to produce a suitable diet. Foods are 
divided into five classes : water, protein, fats, carbohydrates 
and mineral matters. 

Air and sun are also foods, but are not generally spoken of 
as nutrient. 

WATER. 

Our bodies consist of about two-thirds water. It helps to 
regulate the body processes, and supplies building material. 
Watery fruits and vegetables contain pure distilled water. 
The amount of water required for the average individual dif- 
fers greatly. If water is added to our foods in the cooking 
process, a lesser amount is required for drinking. Wholesome, 
non-stimulating food \vill call for a normal supply of water 
between meals. 

PROTEINS. 

These are sometimes called albumen, and they supply the 
body with nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus. They are great 



i 4 FOOD 

tissue builders; they also furnish energy and heat, in combina- 
tion with fats and carbohydrates. 

Sources of Proteins : 

Legumes, lean meats, nuts, cheese, whites of eggs, fish, and 
the glutens of the grains. Milk contains proteins in the right 
proportion with fats and sugars to make it suitable as a food 
for infants. Oats, wheat, and rye contain more protein than 
orner grains, and if no other protein foods are on hand, these 
can maintain health for a long time without harm. (For com- 
binations, see introduction of "Poor Man's Bill of Fare.") 

FATS. 

They are obtained from the vegetable and animal kingdoms. 
They supply heat and energy in the most concentrated form, 
and are also flesh-builders. In diseased conditions, where 
economy of nerve force is required, fats in combination with 
acids, minerals and gelatine can form a substitute for part of 
the protein foods. 

CARBOHYDRATES. 

These are found in large percentage in cereals and in. fruits 
which contain stones and seeds, and in underground vegetables, 
including the lighter starches, such as sago, agar agar, sea 
moss and gum. Milk can serve as a carbohydrate for special 
conditions; being evenly proportioned with fats and protein 
it contains little waste. A certain amount of carbohydrate 
foods in the form of cereals is necessary in our daily diet, 
as they are rich in lime and fat yielding material which is 
required for ligamentous and other elastic tissue. People who 
live on fruits, greens and nuts, or on fruits, greens and meats 
only, require a larger amount of protein food, in order to make 
lip for the loss of cereals. 

MINERAL MATTER. 

In an organic form, we find mineral matter in large propor- 
tions in green leaf vegetables, small fruits and berries, bran, 
rye, green peas, string beans, tomatoes, yolks of eggs and in 
all the outer skins of legumes, grains and fruits. The import- 
ance of the mineral elements in our foods has been little under- 
stood, so far. Of late, health reformers are beginning to real- 
ize that many serious diseases, such as tuberculosis, insanity 



FOOD 15 

and malnutrition, are the result of mineral starvation. Three- 
fourths of these valuable minerals are removed from our foods 
daily by modern milling, bleaching, and polishing of rice, 
wheat, corn and all the other grains. Not alone the minerals, 
but necessary volatile oils, acids, and ferments are removed 
by these processes. Refined white flour and sugar have been 
on the market for the last hundred years; and much time and 
health have been wasted with the writing of fashionable cook 
books, and the manufacture of anemic snow white cakes, crack- 
ers, biscuits and soft putrefying puddings and desserts, pre- 
pared with skim milk, sugar and eggs. The deficiency of 
minerals in these products has created an abnormal desire for 
salts, spices, and chemically pure sugar, followed by an. addi- 
tional craving for intoxicating beverages and liquors. The 
latter articles cannot enter into the composition of perfect 
teeth and bone, or gray nervous tissue; therefore, the result 
is premature death and many new diseases. 

It is my desire to present in this book such food combina- 
tions as perfect as can be produced from food material with 
our present methods of milling and preliminary treatment. 
Many people have become so delicate in structure that they 
cannot use coarse breads and cereals; therefore, a variety of 
different cereal foods have been included. Vegetable foods, 
such as are rich in minerals, have been added to the breakfast 
foods in place of sugar and beverages. In order to supply the 
body with the necessary amount of minerals, we must learn, to 
eat greens for breakfast, until our so-called breakfast foods 
have improved in quality. 

All foods possess potential or latent energy. The sun is the 
great positive element, and plants store up the sun's energy. 
It is transferred to us through the eating of plants and animal 
foods. Through the process of oxidation this energy is set 
free in our bodies, and appears as heat and muscular power. 
This energy contained in foods is known as heat or fuel value, 
and is expressed in terms of a heat unit or calorie. A calorie 
is the amount of heat necessary to raise one kilogram of water, 
one degree centigrade. This is spoken of as a large calorie, 
which is used in determining the energy value of food. The 
small calorie is i/iooo of a large calorie. 



16 FOOD. 

The physiological fuel and energy value of the different 
foods is as follows : 

i gram of Protein yields 4 Calories 

i gram of Fat yields 9 Calories 

i gram of Carbohydrates yields 4 Calories 

To determine the energy value of a food or combination of 
foods it is necessary to know first its composition. Then de- 
termine the weight of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in grams 
and multiply these weights accordingly. 



CHAPTER II. 

STUDY OF FOODS. 

The average homekeeper knows little of the nutritive value 
and chemical composition, of the food she buys. The desire 
to tickle the palate enters more into the selection of food than 
reason or judgment. Others, who have studied along certain 
lines without the fundamental training for this work, often 
make greater mistakes in the selection and combination of 
foods than if they had not studied the subject at all. 

It is not sufficient to know just which foods are suitable to 
the individual and which are harmful; it is necessary to have 
a fairly well balanced diet which contains the correct propor- 
tions of protein and non-protein elements. 

The following pages present briefs on the value and chemical 
nature of different foods not mentioned in recipes : 



VEGETABLE FOODS. 

These are divided into several classes. They are : Legumes, 
cereals, roots, bulbs, tubers, leaf, flower and fruit vegetables, 
All plants are made up of a mass of cells, each consisting of a 
membranous wall, enclosing a gelatinous mass, in which lie 
imbedded the nucleus or center of cell activity and minute 
grains of starch or other material which the plant has manu- 
factured. 

In young plants these cell walls are called cellulose; later 
wood cells begin to develop. The wood cells grow into 
fibrous material, called woody fibre. In poorly grown or stale, 
vegetables this woody tissue becomes very hard and thick, and 
therefore is indigestible. For this reason it is best that all 
green vegetables are grown quickly and eaten while they are 
fresh. When fresh they will snap crisply. Peas, green, corn 
and string beans will cook in one-third of the time if used 
directly after gathering, instead of being kept for several days 
before using. 



i8 STUDY OF FOODS. 

THE LEGUMES. 

The legumes are rich in vegetable protein, and differ from 
flesh foods on account of being richer in protein and minerals 
and less stimulating. They are free from animal intoxication. 

DRIED PEAS. 

Green peas are richer in minerals than yellow peas, beans 
or lentils, the protein being in the form of legumin and easier 
to digest. They are very purifying and should be eaten freely, 
especially during the cold winter or rainy season. They are a 
suitable food for the brain-worker as well as for the muscular- 
worker, and can be prepared in many different ways. Yellow 
peas are an excellent food for muscular-workers. 

DRIED BEAXS. 

They contain more of the protein than peas, lentils or beef. 
They are therefore a very rich food and should not be con- 
sumed in large quantities. The brown, red, and black beans 
are richer in iron and minerals, and are therefore more suitable 
in cold weather. The hulls of all legumes are difficult to digest, 
therefore it is important to soak legumes before cooking. In 
countries where the water is hard, it is well to have soft water 
on hand for the cooking of legumes. If rain water cannot be 
obtained, boil a kettle of water each day and set aside to cool 
for cooking purposes. Legumes may be soaked with hot or 
cold water. Green lima beans should be put to cook in boiling 
water without soaking, like all green vegetables. 

LENTILS. 

They are rich in iron and should be used freely in cold 
weather. Boiled onions are a good addition, in place of fat 
meat GREEN PEAS AND BEANS. 

Green, peas differ from other green vegetables. They are 
richer in protein and can serve as a meat substitute during the 
summer. String-beans resemble the green leaf vegetables in 
their composition, but do not contain sufficient protein to serve 
as a meat substitute. They are very purifying to the liver and 
intestines, and should be eaten freely by people of a bilious 
temperament. 



STUDY OF FOODS. 19 

CABBAGE. 

Cabbage is rich in minerals. It can be made very indigesti- 
ble by careless preparation. Raw cabbage is easily digested if 
chopped very fine and mixed with grated potato and mayon- 
naise dressing. Cooked cabbage should be treated with acid 
and mixed with the yolk of an egg if it disagrees. Some people 
prefer sprouts to cabbage. They resemble each other very 
much in composition. Cabbage contains more water and cellu- 
lose. It is best to use only the innermost part of cabbage, if it 
disagrees. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

This belongs to the cabbage family. It is rich in sulphur 
and is one of the most easily digested vegetables, if properly 
prepared. If it disagrees, treat it with acid or serve it for 
breakfast instead of for dinner. 

CELERY. 

Celery contains valuable minerals and is soothing to the 
nervous system. Celery roots are rich in fat and a healing food 
for people with kidney, liver, and intestinal trouble. The green 
stalks of celery root should never be thrown away. They can 
be tied into a bunch and cooked with soups of meat or legumes. 
Celery is a very valuable food for people with a bilious tem- 
perament. 

ASPARAGUS. 

This is an easily digested vegetable and resembles celery. 
As a food for medicinal purposes it may be eaten raw or 
cooked. 

CARROTS AND PARSNIPS. 

They resemble each other, carrots being richer in sugar; 
the parsnip contains a little gluten. They may be eaten in the 
raw state with good effect. 

TURNIPS. 

Turnips contain some valuable minerals, but being rich in 
sugar and water, they are liable to ferment in weak stomachs, 
especially if eaten with lean meats, white breads or other foods, 



20 STUDY OF FOODS. 

which are poor in fat. They should not be eaten in the middle 
of the day by people who do active work. If they disagree at 
night, they may be eaten for breakfast in. combination with fat 
meats or stale bread and butter. Yellow turnips are richer in 
nutriment than white turnips. Raw turnips are wholesome if 
they agree. Never combine turnips with other starchy foods 
at the same meal, such as potatoes, rice, white flour prepara- 
tions, apples or cucumbers. 

CORN. 

Green corn is rich in fat and protein, and can form a perfect 
meal during the summer if combined with tomatoes. Do not 
cook the corn if it is agreeable raw. Canned corn should be 
used with care for people with intestinal weaknesses. If used 
for soups it should be strained and diluted with an. equal 
amount of hot water before thickening. 

TOMATO. 

The tomato stimulates peristalsis and is a wonderful tonic 
for the liver. It is one of the most perfect fruits, rich in oxalic 
acid and iron, and unsurpassed as a medicinal food. It contains 
a vegetable calomel and serves as a purifier for the liver in 
bilious conditions. It can be prepared and combined in many 
different ways. It may be one of the first articles given to 
a patient after an operation, serving as a food and tonic ; it 
counteracts the sweetish taste of the chloroform and prevents 
fatty degeneration of the liver. 

Whether a food is eaten raw or cooked it is important that 
it be ripe. (Not ripened on the market.) For people with 
weak digestive organs, the best way to serve tomatoes is in 
the form of sterilized strained juice over toast in combination 
with 'milk or in the form of soup from canned strained toma- 
toes. The theory that tomatoes are liable to produce cancer 
is entirely unfounded. Any kind of food if eaten in excess and 
wrongly combined will aid in the progress of disease, but .all 
natural foods rightly combined are wholesome if eaten accord- 
ing to needs of the individual. 

Tomatoes combine well with fatty foods, eggs, cheese, 
meats and fish. 



STUDY OF FOODS. 21 

LETTUCE. 

This is the most desirable greens on our tables and combines 
well with almost any kind of food. Being rich in minerals and 
alkaloidal extracts, it tends to render the digestive fluids alka- 
line and promotes oxidation and nutrition. If lettuce is eaten 
in proper proportion with other foods at the morning or noon 
meal, it has a sedative effect and keeps an excitable constitu- 
tion, better balanced throughout the day. People with delicate 
stomachs should not eat lettuce at the evening meal. All raw 
salads prepared from greens and super-acid fruits are best 
eaten at the beginning of the meal, or with the meat dish at 
the morning or noon meal. 

CUCUMBERS. 

They are a valuable food and should be eaten almost daily 
by growing children and anemic people, especially if much 
muscular work is required. The cucumber is considered an 
indigestible article of food by people with perverted appetites. 
The way in which the cucumber is .usually prepared in the 
average household renders it unfit to eat. The extraction of 
the natural juice and the treatment with salt make the cucum- 
ber tough and indigestible, and, if eaten in combination with 
half a dozen other articles, it produces indigestion. Cucumbers 
should never be eaten at night. 

NUTS. 

Xuts are high in nutritive value, and are better evenly com- 
bined with non-protein elements than flesh foods are. They 
are rich in fat and minerals, and form an ideal diet in combina- 
tion with raw fruits and greens. They are not sufficiently ap- 
preciated as a food, and receive much unjust criticism as to 
their digestibility. All nuts are wholesome. The right com- 
bination and proportion, and the time of day when eaten, are 
of great importance. The kind of activity as well as individual 
peculiarities have much to do with likes and dislikes or re- 
quirements of certain foods.

These nuts feed the higher nerve centers and generate a 
high quality of intelligence.

WALNUTS, PINE KERNELS AND CHESTNUTS. 

These are excellent for those who wish to put on flesh. Care 
must be taken not to overtax the liver. People who have been 
accustomed to a large amount of bread or other starchy foods 
should begin with a small amount, and substitute them for 
bread. If they disagree, use lemon, cranberries, oranges or 
fruit salads with them. Walnuts supply the larger nerve 
structures. They are well balanced in all the elements and 
are excellent for people doing hard, muscular work. Sweet 
dried fruits also form a good combination with nuts. Chest- 
nuts resemble cereals on account of being rich in starch. They 
contain less protein, fat and minerals than other nuts, and 
therefore combine well with such foods as supply these ele- 
ments. Baked and boiled chestnuts are generally more agree- 
able than raw ones. Pine nuts are rich in both protein and fat. 

COCOANUTS. 

They are rich in. starch and fat and resemble the cereals 
cl sel y- HAZELNUTS. 

They are a valuable food, but require thorough mastication. 

THE PEANUT. 

The peanut is a very nutritious nut, but rather difficult of 
digestion for some people. It resembles beans and peas, and 
is sometimes classed as a legume. Excess of nuts at one meal, 
or nuts which have been poorly masticated, may cause severe 
disturbances of the liver and stomach. If the teeth are poor, 
the nuts may be ground, but even then great care must be 
exercised to insure their proper insalivation. Cooked nut 
foods and all vegetarian dishes to which strained legumes, nut- 
butter, eggs and other rich foods are added, should not be in- 
dulged in by people with weak stomachs. 

NUT-BUTTER. 

Great care should be exercised in the preparation of foods 
with nut-butter. Never spread it on bread without first dilut- 
ing it with an equal amount of water. Do not keep it on the 
shelf like ordinary butter after it has been mixed with water; 
prepare only sufficient to last for twenty-four hours, and keep 
it on ice.

FRUITS. 

There are three classes of fruit: acid, sub-acid, and sweet 
fruits. 

Fresh raw fruits, if eaten in the right proportion with other 
articles, are wholesome. The habit of eating a large amount 
of acid fruits at the beginning of the morning meal is not neces- 
sary. If a heavy meal is eaten, in the evening, remaining half 
digested in the stomach over night and putrefying, then acid 
fruits will cleanse the stomach in the morning. The better way 
is to go to bed with an empty stomach and there will be no 
need of cleansing in the morning. People of a highly nervous 
temperament should not eat the very sweet fruits at the morn- 
ing or noon meal, as at this time they are too stimulating. 

Hot' house fruits out of season are health destroying. Cer- 
tain fruits, such as apples, plums, tomatoes, apricots, grapes, 
figs, bananas and cranberries, will keep for a long time in the 
natural state, if properly preserved. Some of them can be 
dried and used in the winter. Fresh fancy summer fruits are 
not required during the winter by healthy individuals, neither 
are canned fruits, jams or jellies. 

The canning of fruits during hot summer days is a health 
destroying occupation and a waste of time and money. Fresh 
fruits prepared with a large amount of water and sugar are 
li'tle better than beer, wine and whiskey. If such fruits are 
eaten with yeast bread, potatoes and a variety of other food- 
stuffs, they set up fermentation and burden, the eliminating 
organs. A few jars of sterilized fruit juice should be prepared 
and kept on hand for medicinal purposes only. 

Fruits are an important article of diet, but few people know 
how to use them wisely. A large percentage of deaths in 
ycung children is due directly to the wrong use of fruits. 
Many forms of infantile paralysis, intestinal disease and mal- 
nutrition in general are due to the lack of knowledge of the 
scientific combination of fruits with other articles of food, so 
as to furnish a wholesome meal. 

Many teachers of Domestic Science and writers in monthly 
magazines seem to have forgotten, entirely of what an ordinary 
mixed diet should consist. Their bills-of-fare are becoming 



24 STUDY OF FOODS. 

more complex all the time. AYe find combinations, such as 
banana fritters, custard, meat, potatoes, nuts, milk, biscuits, 
dates, several kinds of vegetables, puddings, cheese, coffee, 
cake and ice cream, suggested for one meal (sometimes less, 
other times more than this). Any intelligent, thinking person 
must realize that such a mixture, besides being a great waste, 
will turn the stomach of the strongest individual into a yeast 
pot. Those with strong eliminating organs, who take plenty 
of out-door exercise and recreation of some kind, may be able 
to throw off the excess of poison for a long period, while 
others endowed with less vigor will suffer from the effects 
within a short time. 

People who live on cooked foods consisting mainly of meat, 
bread, sugar, soups, puddings, cooked cereals, milk, etc., should 
realize that they have already filled their systems with foods 
which contain a large amount of water, and therefore will 
overburden their intestines and kidneys by adding a liberal 
amount of -fruits to such a dietary. There is always great dan- 
ger of fermentation and. putrefaction, especially if constipation 
sets in, and here we have all the dangers of modern diseases, 
which begin with mal-nutrition, be it from under- or over-feed- 
ing. Only the most perfect specimens of men and women are 
safe from danger. Why? Because their instincts lead them 
to choose the right articles in the right combination, and at 
the table they know "when to stop," while an individual with 
weak sensory nerves does not feel the effects of satisfaction 
from the food until dullness, pain or discomfort appear. It is 
from this lattter class mostly, that we have our health reform- 
ers, while the former class with their perfect battery, which 
can turn the poorest food materials into first grade tissue, look 
on us as diet cranks and faddists. 

The man who ate three square meals all his life, indulged 
in tea, coffee, liquor and tobacco, was never sick and lived to 
be 100 years old, probably could have lengthened his years to 
300, had he not been so dangerously strong. 

The menus suggested in this book are made up carefully and 
scientifically, so that each individual can easily find a diet 
suited to his temperament, environment, age and occupation. 
Nuts contain a high percentage of protein, and therefore form 



STUDY OF FOODS. 25 

an ideal dietary in combination with fruits. Meats, eggs, 
cheese, cream and fish are the next best articles suitable to 
combine with fruits; raw greens are an excellent addition, but 
breads, puddings, sugars, beverages, mushes and cooked vege- 
tables are better left out at a meal if an abundance of fruits 
are taken, especially at dinner, or the amount of watery foods 
taken into the body during twenty-four hours will not be in 
the proper proportion to the solids. Dry legumes are very 
rich in protein, but being dissolved with water during the cook- 
ing process are less suited to combine with raw fruits, especial- 
ly for those suffering with flatulence or kidney disorders. 
Apples, tomatoes and vegetables combine best with legumes. 
Apples and tomatoes, being of the most perfect type of foods, 
combine well with all classes of protein foods, including cereals. 
They should be staple articles in every household. As to other 
fiuit combinations, study recipes and menus, and keep in mind 
that no matter how 7 valuable an article may be, excess is a 
poison. 

Those who live mainly upon dry foods, such as uncooked 
cereals and nuts, can safely make their morning and evening 
meal of fruits alone, while others who live like the average, 
if they attempt to make a meal of fruits alone, and continue 
to do active work, will soon fail in health. 

BERRIES. 

All berries are rich in minerals and feed the brain cells. They 
contain traces of protein. Blackberries and huckleberries are 
rich in volatile oils and iron, and are of great medicinal value. 
They are excellent for the evening meal in the form of gruels 
and drinks. 

People with digestive troubles should be careful in combin- 
ing raw blackberries with other foods. They are rich in pro- 
tein and may take the place of part of the meat dish on hot 
summer days. They should never be used as a dessert after a 
heavy meal. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

Strawberries are the first fruit to make their appearance in 
the spring. They are rich in iron and valuable acids. As they 



26 STUDY OF FOODS. 

are in season for a long time they should not be eaten to ex- 
cess, never more than once per day. From three to eight 
ounces, according to age, is sufficient for one meal. If perfect- 
ly fresh, they combine well with fresh cream or milk. Yeast 
bread, red meats or legumes should not be eaten at the same 
meal with strawberries. Berries which have undergone slight 
decomposition should be placed in a mason fruit jar with a 
little water and be sterilized. This juice will keep for several 
days in a cold place and can be used for the flavoring of milk, 
or for softening zwieback which is to be served with cream or 
milk. If the juice has undergone fermentation reboil it before 
using. It may be used for fruit puddings or fruit gruels or be 
mixed with other fruit juices. In this way everything is util- 
ized and nothing wasted. 

CHERRIES. 

The cherry season is short. Therefore, they should be eaten 
almost daily. All varieties are wholesome. If desired, several 
kinds may be mixed at one meal. They combine well with egg 
foods, whole wheat, cornmeal and fish. They may be eaten 
at the beginning or at the end of a meal or by themselves. 
People with weak stomachs should not eat them at night. 

BLACKBERRIES. 

They are a valuable and nutritious fruit and can form a 
perfect meal in combination with light cereal foods. They 
have little preservative properties and therefore should be 
eaten only^when perfectly- fresli. For young children or people 
with* intestinal weakness, only the juice should be used in the 
4orm of wine or gruels. 

RASPBERRIES. 

T<fe?y gre a light and delicious fruit. They combine well with 
milk, egg foods, or nuts; and can be served morning, noon or 
night. 

PEACHES, PEARS AND APRICOTS. 
They are all three rich ; n sugar and cellulose, and can form 
a substitute for part of the cereal foods during hot summer 
days. (See recipes for Salads.) 



STUDY OF FOODS. 27 

THE PINEAPPLE. 

The pineapple contains bromaline and is of medicinal value 
in the treatment of certain stomach disorders. It is not a 
necessary article for the table of people of moderate means. 

BANANAS. 

They are a very nutritious fruit and can partially replace the 
cereals. If combined with green leaves, and lemon, they can 
form a perfect meal. The bitter substance which is contained 
in the inner skin of the banana should be scraped off with a 
knife and added to the bulk, as it counteracts the sweet flavor 
of the banana and adds to its digestibility. Baked bananas 
are not necessary for a healthy stomach. 

APPLES. 

They are among the most perfect of fruits. People who have 
difficulty in digesting a sufficient amount of cereals should eat 
apples almost daily. If raw apples disagree, they can be made 
agreeable by combining them with fat meats or oil in. the form 
of a salad. Baked apples and apple sauce are also good, pro- 
vided they are not spoiled with too much sugar. Some apples 
are fibrous and muscle-feeding; others are richer in phosphates 
a/.d valuable minerals. For salads use tart apples. 

GRAPES. 

Grapes are a valuable fruit for the table if eaten in the right 
proportion with other foods which contain fat and protein. 
They are rich in sugar and tartaric acid. As a medicinal fruit 
they may be eaten in large quantities by themselves. 

NECTARINES. 

Like the pineapple, they belong to the luxurious fruits and 
are adapted for people with a large purse. They are rich in 
sugar and starch, with a small amount of cellulose. 

ORANGES, GRAPEFRUIT, LEMONS AND LIMES. 

They all belong to the citric acid group, and are of all the 
fruits, the richest in valuable acids, which in the process of 
digestion are converted into salts, rendering the blood more 
alkaline. The latter three should be used in greater quantities 
in countries near the coast or in low and damp districts, espe- 
cially during the rainy season. The outer skin is rich in vola- 



28 STUDY OF FOODS. 

tile oils and is useful in the preparation of fruit-and-milk 
soups. The white rind is useful as a medicine, for patients 
who suffer from malaria. A small amount of it chewed while 
sipping a glass of fresh milk will greatly add to the digesti- 
bility of the milk and serve as a germicide to the liver. The 
juice of one-quarter of a lemon may be taken in. connection 
with the skin of one-half a lemon, in combination with a glass 
of milk. During fever, the skin should be carefully expecto- 

FRUIT JELLIES. 

If prepared from fruit juice and cane sugar only, they are 
powerful stimulants and have little food value, for the reason 
that they arouse the nerve cells to extreme activity and rapid 
oxidation. They furnish no food for the nerve cells, and the 
nutritious elements in the other food materials taken in com- 
bination with these jellies pass out of the body without being 
assimilated, or produce congestion and inflammatory conditions. 
Even natural stimulants, in the form of raw fruits, can become 
harmful if taken, in excess, or in the wrong combinations, un- 
suitable to the individual requirements. If the glycogen-mak- 
ing function of the liver becomes overburdened, the result will 
be diabetes, neuralgia or starch-poison. 

COMPOTES OR STEWED FRUITS. 

They are more wholesome and economical than jams and 
jellies, which are prepared with large amounts of sugar. 

They are best served with the meat dish or with some sub- 
stantial pudding. If served with sponge cake at the end of a 
rneal, the digestive juice becomes acid, and produces fermenta- 
tion and mal-nutrition. 



Green, red and blue plums are all valuable fruits. The blue 
plum is rich in iron, minerals, and sugar, and is, next to apples 
and tomatoes, one of the most perfect fruits. It has great pre- 
serving qualities and if picked on a dry, sunny day and placed 
carefully in straw in a dry, cold place, will keep until Christ- 
mas. For combination, see menus and salads. 

People who have distress from eating raw plums should let 
them alone or eat them in the dried state only. 



STUDY, OF FOODS. 29 

FIGS AND DATES. 

They have an average of thirty per cent water, are rich in 
sugar and contain some protein and saline matter. They are 
an excellent food for people who are fond of sweets. They are 
more wholesome than canned summer fruits. However, they 
should not be indulged in during hot summer days, or in the 
spring time when the brain needs relaxation. 

THE WATERMELON. 

This is the largest of the melon fruits, containing sugar, 
salts, cellulose and distilled water. It is an excellent food 
curing hot weather. People who suffer from chronic kidney 
disorders should only indulge in it in small quantities at a 
time, and never combine it with mushy or other starchy foods. 
A few drops of lemon is a good addition, in place of free salt. 

MUSKMELON. 

This fruit is also rich in. sugar and cellulose. What has been 
said of watermelon in reference to combination also applies to 
this fruit. CRANBERRIES. 

Cranberries, like gooseberries, currants and lemons, are puri- 
fying to the blood and very valuable as a food in malarial dis- 
tricts. Cranberries combine well with oatmeal, cornmeal, pork, 
chicken, turkey and veal. Use no more sugar for the prepara- 
tion than is absolutely necessary to counteract the tart taste. 
Cranberry jelly prepared with pure sugar is unwholesome. 
Raw cranberries and raw celery are a good combination for 
salad. 



CEREALS. 

Cereals are the most perfect products of the vegetable king- 
dom, and make fairly well balanced foods. They are deficient 
in fat, with the exception of corn and oats. In the processes 
of milling and cooking, cereals have been more abused than 
any other foods, by depriving them of their'valuable minerals, 
and by compounding them into soft putrefying puddings or rich 
cakes. Concentrated or predigested cereals, as advertised 
under the name of breakfast foods, cannot take the place of 



30 STUDY OF FOODS. 

ordinary rolled, whole, or steel cut cereals ; they have lost val- 
uable salts and lime during the process of baking and they also 
deprive the walls of the stomach of the normal stimulus, which 
is necessary for thorough utilization. 

Well boiled cereal foods in the form of dumplings, macaroni, 
noodles or whole cereals are stimulating and heating to the 
whole alimentary tract, they take longer to digest, and are more 
thoroughly utilized by the system. Predigested cereals and 
zwieback are more suitable for the evening meal, or at the 
end of the noon meal, when the body has expended energy. 
Shredded wheat and zwieback may be used with benefit for 
breakfast, if a sufficient amount of raw fruits or greens is eaten 
with them, but if they are used in combination with other 
predigested foods, such as milk or sugar, it gives the intestine 
nothing to do. For the evening meal, toasted breads and ce- 
reals combine well with such foods as supply the lack of lime, 
fats and minerals : cream, fruit-gruels, yolks of eggs, gelatine, 
sago, milk and green foods. 

WHEAT. 

Wheat can be used the year around. In cooking cereals it 
is very important to start with the right quantity of water, and 
allow each starch granule to burst by fast boiling during the 
first twenty or thirty minutes. After this, let it cook slowly for 
twenty or thirty minutes longer, or until it is done. It is not 
necessary to cook cereals for several hours in order to make 
them fit for the human stomach. If well boiled cereals disagree, 
they are generally poorly prepared and allowed to get pasty 
before the starch granules have burst, or else they are combined 
with raw sugar and cream, which produces fermentation. 

RYE. 

Rye is richer in minerals and contains less starch than wheat. 
It is not superior to wheat, but it is one of the oldest and most 
perfect foods, and is the staff of life to some of the healthiest 
and strongest races of the old world. It is laxative, and be- 
cause of this it is more suitable for certain individuals than 
for others. Rye is a good winter food; during the summer 
we have many valuable berries which supply the system with 



STUDY OF FOODS. 31 

certain minerals, therefore we require less of rye bread, or rye 
preparations, during this time of the year. 

Rye combines well with all starchy fruits and vegetables, 
which are deficient in minerals, such as potatoes, pumpkins, 
squash, melons, turnips, carrots, beets, bananas, cucumbers, 
rice and corn. It also combines well with sweet fruits. Apples, 
pork, veal, lamb, cheese, eggs, cream, milk, bacon and oily foods 
are all good additions to rye. Boiled rye and starchy foods are 
unsuitable combinations. 

Whole rye or wheat bread should never be eaten fresh. It 
should be kept in a bread box, with good ventilation, in a dry 
place, or near the stove. Sun dried bread is the best. 

OATS. 

Oats are rich in fat and lime, and like wheat and rye belong 
to the most perfect foods. A fireless cooker is a convenient 
apparatus for the preparation of oats and wheat. They should 
be thoroughly cooked for at least half an hour before setting 
them into the fireless cooker. 

RICE. 

Rice, although low in protein and fat, is one of the most 
easily digested of all cereals, and is especially suitable for brain 
workers and people of sedentary habits. This book contains a 
large number of different recipes for the preparation of rice. 

SAGO AND TAPIOCA. 

They are manufactured from certain palms and roots, and 
belong to the lighter forms of cereals. They are easily digested 
if soaked for several hours before cooking, and can be partially 
substituted for the heavier cereals. Cornstarch, arrowroot, 
potato-flour and agar agar belong to the same class. They 
are all valuable for the sick and for young children. 

BARLEY. 

Barley is also rich in lime ; it should take a more prominent 
place among food substances than, it does. Pearl barley should 
be soaked with soft water before cooking. If it is to be 
strained, mash it up thoroughly with a potato masher, and pour 
more boiling water over it after the first liquid is strained off. 



32 STUDY OF FOODS. 

ANIMAL FOODS. 



EGGS. 

Eggs contain all the elements necessary for the building up 
of a young animal ; they also contain all the elements which 
can be found in, the human body. The eggs of hens are used 
most commonly. The chemical combination of the whole egg 
and that of the brain and nervous system have much in com- 
mon. The white of the egg contains about eighty per cent 
water, twelve of albumen, a small amount of fat and some salts. 
For medicinal purposes, eggs should.be fresh, directly from the 
nest. Eggs are deficient in minerals and should be combined 
with foods which are rich in minerals. 

CHEESE. 

Cheese is one of the most economical and nutritious of foods, 
and a true meat substitute. To serve cheese after a dinner is a 
wasteful extravagance, and dangerous to health. Cheese com- 
bines well with bread, macaroni, potato and other cereals ; 
raw greens are also a good addition. Cooking or baking cheese 
makes it indigestible. Grated or sliced is the best way to 
serve it. People who have difficulty in digesting cheese should 
always combine it with raw apples, onions, or tomatoes and 
lettuce, in the form of a salad. If it still disagrees, leave out 
the cereals entirely at the meal, or use black bread with it. A 
combination of cheese, eggs and milk in the form of a Welsh 
rarebit makes a heavy and indigestible meal, and should only 
be indulged in by people who are very strong, and exercise a 
great deal out of doors. 

People who live almost entirely on cooked foodstuffs and 
white flour bread, find meat a necessary article of food, and 
consume it in larger quantities than would be necessary, if 
whole wheat bread and raw fruits and greens were used. Under 
the present systems of forced and improper feeding of animals, 
and the preservation of meats by cold storage, flesh foods are 
becoming more dangerous. There is no need for such an 
excess in the production of meat, except to satisfy our habits. 
V. human beings and animals are fed by force, they are not 



STUDY OF FOODS. 33 

healthy. Flesh, eggs and milk from animals which are fed by 
force, are unwholesome and inferior in quality. 

Under certain conditions and in cold climates, meat is a 
necessity, therefore the feeding of animals should be under the 
observation of health officers. We need quality more than 
quantity. 

Pork, although condemned by many people as unfit for food, 
is a wholesome article, if the animal is fed upon dry, substan- 
tial food. Pork requires a longer time to digest than other 
meat, and therefore it should not be eaten at the evening meal. 
Pork was considered as an unclean food by the ancient Jews ; 
perhaps the reason for this was that the Jew's system did not 
require pork, because of his constitution and the climatic con- 
ditions. Fat pork is a specific food for the kidneys ; it is less 
stimulating and easier to oxidize than any other meat. 

Beef is perhaps the most economical meat for family use. A 
good quality of meat should contain both fat and lean. All 
meats should be well soaked and washed before cooking. Cold 
meats are sometimes more agreeable than hot meats. 

Veal, lamb, chicken and game are all wholesome meats if 
eaten in. moderation and at the right time of the year. Fresh 
meats should not be served oftener than once per day, or better 
still, three times per week. The internal organs and glands, 
such as the lungs, liver, kidneys, tongue and stomach, are very 
nutritious. Sausages, if prepared from fresh, clean meat, and 
not highly seasoned, are cheaper and more nourishing than 
canned meats, and often preferable to fresh meat, which has 
hung a long time in a meat shop. The internal organs contain 
much lime and organic salts, as they feed the glands of the 
body; they should be well soaked before cooking, in order to 
drain the thick and impure blood out of them. 

Beefsteak, chops and roasts should be slightly salte^ before 
they are cooked. Free salt sprinkled on meat, or other dry 
foods, before serving, is injurious to the lining of the stomach 
and blood vessels ; lemon can be used instead. Many people 
have an abnormal craving for salt. This is a symptom of 
anemia ; the system lacks minerals. The only way to supply 
the necessary elements is by taking salt in the organized state 
in raw greens and fruits. Free salt can satisfy such craving 



34 STUDY OF FOODS. 

temporarily, but it creates an abnormal thirst. Raw apples, 
tomatoes and all other acid fruits, in combination with greens, 
are the best additions to meats. 

FISH. 

Fish is a valuable article of food. It is less stimulating than 
lean meat, and easier to digest and oxidize; for this reason it 
can be recommended for brain workers. It contains a large 
amount of phosphorus and nitrogen, and if properly combined 
with foods which are rich in minerals, such as apples, tomatoes, 
lemons and greens, fish is quickly utilized. Fish and whole rye 
bread is also an excellent combination. Fish being soft, it is 
necessary that it be thoroughly masticated. Fish can become 
very dangerous as a food when not fresh. 

MILK. 

Milk is found indispensable in some cases of sickness, espe- 
cially in. fevers. The greatest care should be exercised in get- 
ting clean, fresh and perfect milk, and in keeping it in a cold, 
clean atmosphere after delivery. Milk may be given as a food, 
raw, boiled, sterilized, pasteurized, or peptonized, and can be 
modified with water or other foods in many different ways. 
The best and most suitable method of preparing it for the 
patient must be left to the attending physician. 

The color of perfect milk is yellowish white, not blue white. 
Its odor is pleasant. A drop of milk poured into a glass of 
fresh water will go to the bottom if it is good milk. In order 
to ascertain if the milk is alkaline, neutral or acid, put a small 
piece of red litmus paper into it, and if it turns strongly blue 
the milk is alkaline. If a blue litmus paper turns strongly red, 
the milk is acid. Perfect milk should be neutral or slightly 
alkaline. After the milk has stood for several hours it grad- 
ually becomes more acid. 

Milk which is acid in reaction, or blue in color, is unfit as a 
food for children and invalids. If a mother is uncertain as to 
the quality of the milk she is feeding her child, she should have 
it examined by the city chemist. 

Milk, even if handled very carefully, contains many germs. 
Therefore, on hot days it is better to sterilize the milk for an 



STUDY OF FOODS. 35 

infant, even if the child is in perfect health, or able to take raw 
milk. If the milk can. be obtained directly from the cow two 
or three times per day, it may be given raw on those occasions. 
If it has stood a little while, it may be heated quickly to 155 
degrees F. over a hot fire, while stirring it. 

CERTIFIED MILK. 

This is a high grade of sanitary milk which comes from 
special dairies, where great care is taken to keep everything 
in perfect sanitary condition. The cows are kept in perfect 
health and are fed upon food which produces milk perfect in 
composition. There are, however, milkmen who have principle 
enough to supply their customers with milk of good character 
and perhaps of as high a grade as that from inspected dairies. 

I have, in my practice, often come in contact with people who 
v, ere informed by their milkmen that certified milk required no 
boiling or sterilization. Some people are impressed with the 
idea that certified milk has already undergone some sort of 
preparation. The fact that in these days milk laboratories can 
be found in many large cities, may easily bring confusion, of 
mind as to "what the milk is certified for," especially to those 
vvho are not acquainted with the preparation of milk and do not 
know the difference between raw and sterilized milk, if they 
buy it. Such instructions should be given by better authorities 
than those who deliver milk, or the label should state "what 
the milk is certified for." Certified, or any other raw milk, 
which is over eight hours old, is not a fit food for infants. 

BOILED MILK AXD CREAM FOR TABLE USE. 
Put the desired amount of milk or cream, or mixed milk and 
cream, into a clean sauce-pan, stir over a hot fire until it reaches 
the boiling point or to about 2OOF. Then pour into a pitcher 
and set in a pan of cold water; stir until the milk is cold. Set 
on ice or in a cold place for 24 hours. Milk prepared in, this 
way is the only wholesome kind to use in addition to boiled 
cereals and fruit puddings. It is also often preferrable to raw 
cream and milk, in combination with raw fruits. If the milk 
is to be used on cereals for the morning meal, it can be reheated 
or used directly after boiling. If hot milk is added to cereals, 
the sugar will not be missed. 



36 STUDY OF FOODS. 

If boiled milk or cream has stood for 24 hours it has become 
unfit for further use unless it is reboiled. If putrefaction has 
set it, boiled milk can become more dangerous as a -food than 
raw milk which has stood for the same length of time ; there- 
fore careful handling of boiled milk as well as other boiled 
foods is of the utmost importance. (See Chapter on Hygiene 
and Economy, under Left-Overs.) 

In many foreign countries it is a general custom in every 
household to boil milk directly after delivery, for the infant as 
well as for table use. To do differently means uncleanliness. 
Modern invention of coolers and ice-boxes in every house, and 
delivery of milk in bottles, has gradually done away with this 
custom. Many of our present generation of house-wives are 
so little acquainted with practical housekeeping that they con- 
sider food fit -for use as long as it has not soured, notwithstand- 
ing the many changes it has undergone on the pantry shelf. 
Raw cream is fit for use only directly after it has left the 
separator. Raw milk should not be considered fresh and whole- 
some for table use longer than eight or ten hours after milking, 
and then only with the most careful handling. Following this 
precaution, morning milk, which is delivered during the day, 
should not be used raw later than five or six o'clock in the 
evening. Remember that all milk begins to turn acid as soon 
as it comes in contact with the air. The longer it stands the 
more acid it will be, besides being laden with germs. The 
process of cooking or scalding raw milk checks the fermenting 
processes and renders the food more alkaline, especially if it is 
to be taken with cereals or fruit puddings and gelatines. 

Cooked milk is not a natural -food, but neither are cooked 
cereals. Raw milk is quickly digested, while boiled milk takes 
several hours to digest, and so do boiled cereals. A combina- 
tion of raw milk, or cream, and cooked cereals will force the 
stomach to absorb the milk immediately, while the remainder, 
poorly masticated and filled with germs, will tend to produce 
an acid process rather than an alkaline. If sugar is added to 
raw milk and cereals, the process of intestinal fermentation is 
complete. If the glandular system and the eliminating organs 
are strong, they will work harder in order to rid the system of 
this excess of acid ; but if the constitution is not able to stand

the strain of wasteful nervous expenditure, discomfort and 
disease will be the result ! Enlarged tonsils are often the first 
sign of danger. We cannot invent customs of feeding that 
interfere with natural laws without paying the penalty. 



MISCELLANEOUS FOODS. 

FATS. 

Fats are derived from the animal and vegetable kingdom ; 
they are rich in carbon and hydrogen, but poor in oxygen. 
Emulsified fats are present in cream, nuts and the yolks of 
eggs. Oleins are mainly found in oils obtained from fruits, 
nuts and vegetables. Butter contains mainly palmitin. Suet, 
from beef and mutton, consists of stearin and palmitin. Leci- 
thin is found in yolks of eggs and in some nuts ; it is a highly 
complex compound, and a food for the brain and nerve sub- 
stance. Suet and mutton fat contain much stearin, and are 
harder to digest by some people than other fats. However, the 
digestibility of a food depends much upon the individual re- 
quirements, and a little self study will soon convince each 
what forms of fat are best suited to his needs. As a rule, peo- 
ple of large bone structures require a greater amount of fat in 
their food than those not so constructed. 

Fats are changed into fatty acids and glycerine by the secre- 
tion of the bile and pancreatic juice, and in combination with 
the intestinal juices form soluble soaps. In acute diseases fats 
should be taken only in the form of butter, milk, or cream, in 
limited quantities. Fatty foods are beneficial for children suf- 
fering with scrofula or rickets, and :'n all chronic, wasting dis- 
eases. 

People who do much indoor work, or those who are not able 
to digest a sufficient amount of protein or cereals, require more 
fats. The latter can be made easily digestible if rightly com- 
bined and prepared in the form of soups, warm sauces, boiled 
custards and mayonnaise dressing. In this way the fat globules 
are equally divided in the food and can be better emulsified than 
if eaten in the solid form, or in combination w r ith white bread 
or other unsuitable articles. Cream, and the lighter nuts, com- 



38 STUDY OF FOODS. 

bine well with sweet foods, while oils, yolks of eggs, meat fats, 
and solid fats, combine well with foods which are rich in min- 
erals and oxygen. 

People who are unable to furnish their table with expensive 
fats, such as butter, olives, cream, olive oil, bacon, eggs, eel 
and other delicacies, should use the cheaper forms of fats, as 
corn, oats, herring, walnuts, cream-cheese, cottonseed oil, bran., 
leaf lard, vegetable butter, middle rib of beef, blood and liver 
sausages. Meat products, prepared -from the internal organs of 
the animal, are rich in lime and fat, and, if prepared from fresh 
meats of healthy animals, they are often preferable to canned 
and cold storage products, or to meat which hangs in a meat- 
shop for a week. However, every one who buys these articles 
should investigate the source and manner of preparation for 
himself. 

SUGAR. 

Artificial sugar is not a necessary article of food for the 
healthy individual who is able to supply his body with fresh 
and dried fruits the year round. 

True candies are : figs, dates, raisins and other tropical fruits. 
The delicious summer fruits are better eaten without sugar. 
Undoubtedly nature did not mean for us to indulge in sweets 
during hot days, or she would have provided us more plenti- 
fully with them. All the spring fruits are tart : people who 
wish to improve the taste of berries add sugar to them at the 
expense of health. Our forefathers, who did not enjoy such 
luxuries, had better health than our present generation. The 
sugar-cane in its natural state is a valuable food. It contains 
gluten and minerals, such as are found in other vegetables, and 
if eaten in this form it is more wholesome than refined sugar. 
The gluten and minerals are destroyed by chemical processes 
which are necessary to produce sugar from the cane and beet. 
Pure, crystalized sugar cannot sustain life, unless it is eaten 
in the proper proportion, with foods which contain gluten, min- 
erals and fats. 

Sugar which contains minerals cannot crystalize : it remains 
syrup, therefore the latter is more wholesome than sugar. In 
order to produce beets, which are richer in sugar and poorer in 



STUDY OF FOODS. 39 

salts, certain methods of manuring are employed. The profit 
gained by this method is a financial one. The consumer is 
the loser. 

If artificial sugar is united with cocoa or other bitter, sour, 
nutritious substances it will serve as a food; therefore, sugar 
in the form of a prepared food such as chocolate, gelatine and 
gruels is wholesome for those who require cooked foods. If 
the sugar industry were diminished, the canning and stewing 
of fruits would also be diminished, and we would have fewer 
tea and coffee drunkards. All this gluttony in stimulating bev- 
erages and sweet fruit sauces was not indulged in by the masses 
a hundred years ago, therefore the constitution of the average 
individual at that time was much stronger. 

Many parents are impressed with the idea that their children 
require a large amount of sweets, in order to make them grow. 
"*Ye cannot force nature without paying the penalty. At ma- 
turity, we reap what has been sown for us, or what we have 
sown for ourselves. 

SPICES. 

Spices are a species of aromatr'c vegetables and fruits used 
for the seasoning and preservation of foods. Their flavor is 
pleasant and stimulating to the mucous membrane of the 
mouth. 

The odoriferous substances yielded from these plants are: 
the volatile oils and ethers of peppermint, roses, orange flower, 
lavender, camphor, lemon, bitter almond, wintergreen, cinna- 
mon, cloves and a number of others. They are used for per- 
fumes, medicines, confections, and in the art of cookery. Many 
of the spices used for food are dried, as bay leaves, thyme, 
marjoram, vanilla beans, dried skins of lemons and oranges. 
Ground spices or liquid extracts should be used sparingly. 
Many of them are adulterated. Free salt and ground spices 
create an abnormal desire for water and food, and they injure 
the mucous membrane lining of the blood vessels and glandular 
structures, and obstruct the capillaries. 

People who cannot relish their food without these artificial 
appetizers should fast a while, or replace them by natural stim- 
ulants, as tomatoes, apples, lemons and greens. Few people 



40 STUDY OF FOODS. 

realize the harm that is done by the number of salt, sugar and 
pepper holders that are placed on the table at every meal, to 
say nothing of the dozens of boxes of ground spices that fill 
the kitchen shelf. A pinch of pepper on gravies, milk soups, or 
other nutritious dishes, if mixed thoroughly with the food, 
assists in the coagulation of soft nitrogenous foods and prevents 
putrefaction, but excess of it, or if sprinkled on dry food, is very 
harmful. 

The best way to use spices is to buy them whole, in the fresh 
or dried state, and chop, grate, or grind them when needed. 
Vanilla beans, bitter almonds, bay leaves, cinnamon bark ancl 
many others may be used whole and removed before serving. 

Children's food should never be covered with pepper or other 
stimulating spices. Under our present system of living salt has 
become a necessary adjunct to our food. Legumes, cereals or 
any other foods which require a large amount of water for cook- 
ing need an additional amount of salt. It should be added be- 
fore the food is removed from the fire, so that the salt will be 
properly dissolved and combined with the food. Moderate 
amounts of preserved, salted meats and fish are valuable as 
antiseptics, if combined with soft, cooked, nutritious foods in 
the form of soups and gravies, or with milk foods, eggs, cereals 
or legumes. Salt used in this way will not hurt the lining of 
the alimentary tract and other tissues, as free salt does when 
it is sprinkled on lettuce, meat, potatoes or other dry food. 
Never use salted, smoked or preserved meats or fish in excess. 
If possible, investigate the source and manner of preparation of 
preserved foods. 

DESSERTS. 

Desserts have only been, mentioned in the form of steamed 
puddings, gelatines, oranges, grapes or bread and butter in 
combination with black unsweetened coffee. Artificially pre- 
pared desserts in the form of attractive, soft puddings and 
other rich mixtures flatter the palate and renew the appetite. 
The true enjoyment of eating is in the satisfaction of hunger. 
The craving for desserts indicates a desire to stimulate certain 
nerves, which force the contents of the stomach into the intes- 
tine and destroy the digestive processes or produce decomposi- 



STUDY OF FOODS. 41 

tion, hasten absorption, and exhilarate the brain with the 
toxins hereby produced. 

Those who desire to correct the habits of intoxication in 
themselves or in others should consider whether the abnormal 
craving is for merely physical pleasure or for the satisfaction 
of starved and overworked brains and bodies, and the change 
should be brought about accordingly. To drop a long acquired 
habit at once may prove harmless to one person and very fatal 
to another. 

The worn-out digestive organs need to be toned up and de- 
veloped gradually, either by stimulating fruits or fruit juices 
or by tonics in the form of bran-tea and malt-coffee. 

People who have vigorous appetites and strong digestive 
organs may eat a few nuts at the end of the meal until the 
appetite has been restored to normal. For those who like 
sweets, a large number of recipes have been given for fruit 
salads and light cooked dishes. Many can be served as whole 
meals for the evening, or in combination with milk broths or 
soups. 

MUFFINS AND PANCAKES. 

Many people who find pancakes indigestible will do well 
to observe the time when they are most agreeable. If they are 
made with eggs, cream, and water, or with rich milk, and prop- 
erly prepared and combined with suitable articles, they are 
generally agreeable to the most sensitive stomach. 

People of sedentary habits, or those who do brain work 
mainly, should not eat pancakes or muffins for breakfast. 

All ingredients, as well as the vessel, should be cold. The 
batter should also be made in a cold place or out of doors. 
The oven, the baking pans and the oil in which the cakes are 
baked, should be as hot as possible. 

BREAD. 

Bread made from white flour and yeast is the staff of death. 
Few people realize that if they wish to use white bread as a 
food the proper amount of minerals, fats and nitrogen must 
be added, in order to make it a perfect food. Yeast bread, if 
eaten with jams and jellies in large quantities between meals, 



42 STUDY OF FOODS. 

is health destroying and dwarfs the body. It is also unwise to 
eat white bread in combination with other starches, as rice, 
potatoes and soft puddings. The average individual who takes 
plenty of out-door exercise may get along well for years on 
such mixtures and suffer no inconvenience, but people with 
poor eliminating organs or chronic ailments, or those who do 
much indoor work, do well to use yeast bread in moderation, 
especially if prepared from white flour. 

Baked and boiled cereals are more nutritious than bread. In 
the fermenting process which takes place in rising bread, val- 
uable substances such as lime and salts are lost. It is rendered 
more acid, and therefore unfit as a food for people with weak 
stomachs. If yeast bread is combined with foods which render 
the fluids of the stomach alkaline, it is less harmful. 

SOUPS. 

Many American housekeepers do not know how to prepare 
soups and do not like them. The fact that people of many 
nations in the old world, with smaller incomes than the average 
American working man, use soups daily, once or twice, and 
are far superior in physical strength and endurance to the 
latter, who lives mainly on beefsteak, white bread, potatoes, 
sugar, tea and coffee, should convince every one that nutritious 
soups are an important article of diet. Close study and per- 
sistent effort will enable every homekeeper with small means 
to learn how to prepare a soup that is palatable and nutritious. 
The daily use of white bread and butter is expensive. Besides 
it produces diseases, imperfect bodies and premature old age. 

All who are in the habit of eating more than their systems 
require and especially those who indulge in large amounts of 
bread at dinner, would do well to begin their meal with a soup. 
Legume and cream soups will furnish a satisfactory meal by 
themselves. For combinations see "Menus."

CHAPTER I. 

GREEN VEGETABLES. 

Green vegetables furnish a large amount of easily digested 
carbohydrates and contain much mineral matter in which meats 
and cereals are deficient. That they add to the highest purity 
of our blood has been proven by the fact that many blood and 
skin diseases have been cured by the application of specific 
greens alone. However, no matter how valuable an, article is, 
it should be used according to the needs of the individual. As 
vegetables also contain a large amount of water, it is not wise 
for one who has to perform active mental or physical labor 
to indulge in a large amount of cooked, especially under- 
ground, vegetables at the noon meal. At this time of the day 
the system requires the most nutritious foods in the form of 
proteid elements, no matter whether the meal consists of 
cooked food, cold or warmed over. Green peas and corn are 
best eaten at the noon meal, as they are rich in proteid ele- 
ments. Asparagus, tomatoes, string beans and leaf greens are 



44 VEGETABLES. 

also suitable at this time of the day, provided some nutritious 
food of the proteid class is served with them. For further com- 
binations, see "Left Overs" and Menus. 

The blanching of vegetables, as advised by some authorities, 
\\ill always remove valuable constituents of the plant. The 
blanching and ventilation, of vegetables during the process of 
cooking is advised, in order to make them more wholesome. 
A31 artificially prepared foods will lose certain constituents 
through the process of cooking, and this loss is generally made 
up by additional flavoring or sauces. Vegetables which are 
cooked in very little water and kept well covered (not venti- 
lated), will love less of their natural qualities, and the inju- 
rious gases which do not escape by this process can be made 
harmless through the addition of fats, in the emulsified form, 
as sauces, the yolk of an egg, lemon or cream. 

In the consumption of food, as well as the custom of dress 
and education, some people have reached that stage of refine- 
ment where degeneration begins. We cannot refine natural 
food without paying the penalty for it, which means the pro- 
ducing of disease and the shortening of life. The excessive use 
of refined sugar, alcohol and other artificial stimulants, has 
produced a dislike for fatty foods by many people, so that 
they refuse to eat sauces, or fat meats in any form, the only fat 
they use being butter. While the latter is a valuable food, it 
often cannot be assimilated by the system if spread on white 
bread, or mixed with cooked vegetables ; it generally serves 
only as a lubricant. If butter is eaten in excess, especially in 
the summer, it clogs the system. Some people prepare vege- 
tables and soups with melted butter for the sake of convenience. 
This is a waste, since a tablespoonful of butter or other fat 
properly emulsified as directed under butter sauces will often 
give more nutriment than one-quarter of a pound of butter 
wasted by soaking into toast or other cooked foods. 

The American method of cooking green vegetables in a 
large amount of water and throwing it away, then seasoning 
them with butter and spices and serving them with lean meat 
and white bread, produces a starvation diet. In such a meal, 
the important mineral matter and the fats in vegetables and 
whole wheat grains are left out, and are supplemented by an 



VEGETABLES. 45 

excess of starches and water in the form of bread, beverages 
and desserts. Additional fats should be added scientifically 
and combined with foods which are rich in minerals and acids. 

All vegetable water, especially that of canned or sterilized 
fruits and vegetables, is very wholesome and antiseptic. 
Strained, sterilized tomato, currant, gooseberry and strawberry 
jnices are unsurpassed as a liver medicine in some conditions. 
These same foods will lose their medicinal value if stewed 
in an open kettle. They should be prepared in Mason jars or 
cans. After opening, these fruit juices may be kept in earthen- 
ware on. ice for twelve hours, and served again. After this they 
should be reboiled or sterilized, in order to check fermentation. 
For the sick, the same precaution should be taken with keeping 
fruit juices as with milk. 

AYhen using canned vegetables, never throw away the 
water, if it is not to be used for dressing. Add it to soups or 
i;se it in place of beverages. Pea, bean and asparagus water 
may be made very palatable if cream is added. See prepara- 
tion of legume teas under "Fluids." 

In, preparing vegetables for the sick, the finest of all dress- 
ings is the yolk of an egg and lemon juice, with a small amount 
of butter. The fat in the yolk of the egg being emulsified in 
a perfectly natural state, it feeds the mucous membrane of the 
entire alimentary tract and blood vessels. Besides neutralizing 
the gas producing tendencies of the foods, it aids in, the diges- 
tive and assimilating processes and feeds the nerve sheaths. 
In all chronic conditions, which are the result of hardening of 
the arteries, a large amount of the yolk of eggs, combined 
with lemon and oil, may be used. There are a few vegetables 
which do not combine well with the yolk of an egg, such as 
turnips, carrots, beets and onions. These contain a large 
amount of sulphur and iron, which is also found in the yolk of 
the egg. Fat meats are good additions to the last mentioned 
vegetables, except onions, which are rich in oil themselves. If 
underground vegetables are served in the form of purees, they 
should be mashed very fine or rubbed through a colander ; the 
butter which is added should not be allowed to boil. Peas, 
beans, cauliflower and cabbage are most likely to disagree if 



4 6 VEGETABLES. 

served with butter only. Butter sauces, cream sauces, yolks 
of eggs and lemon are the best additions to make them agree- 
able. 

Some people prefer vegetables cooked in oil. Those whose 
systems can digest a large amount of fat will find them agree- 
able. 

ARTICHOKES. 

Wash them thoroughly and remove the outside leaves. Drop 
into salted boiling water and cook for 20 or 30 minutes. Add 
a few drops of vinegar to the water while boiling. Serve warm 
with a white sauce or let cool and serve with French or mayon- 
naise dressing. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Wash and cut them into inch pieces until the hard part of 
the stem is reached. Boil them for 20 minutes, or until tender. 
Serve warm with butter, milk, cream, or egg sauce, or cold 
with French or mayonnaise dressing. The asparagus may be 
scraped and tied into bundles when boiling. 

BEETS. 

Remove the green tops and wash them carefully. Do not 
prick the skin, as the juice will then escape and injure the 
color as well as the flavor. Young beets will be tender in about 
one hour, older ones take two to three hours. When done, 
peel and slice. Serve with a butter or cream sauce, or plain, 
with butter and chopped parsley. For salad, cut into slices 
and pour over them boiling vinegar, diluted with one-half 
water. Add whole spices if desired. 

MASHED BEETS. 

Prepare like the above. When tender, peel and mash very 
fine with a potato masher, and add butter and a few drops of 
lemon juice. 

BEET GREENS. 

Wash the tops and boil in a very little water until tender. 
A^ small piece of salted or smoked lean meat may be boiled 
with them to give them a better flavor. Chop fine and flavor 



VEGETABLES. 47 

with butter and lemon juice. A brown butter sauce may be 
prepared from the water in which the greens have been boiled ; 
when done mix with the finely chopped greens, and let it boil 
a second, and flavor with lemon. 

ROASTED CARROTS. 

Wash, scrape, and cut them lengthwise into half's and quar- 
ters, then cut crosswise into inch pieces or smaller. Cover with 
boiling water and cook for 10 or 15 minutes, with a little salt. 
Drain off the water (add to soups) ; brown some fat and flour, 
add to it soup stock, whey or the water which was drained off, 
and roast the carrots in it until done. Cover them tightly and 
add more fluid while roasting, if necessary. Flavor with 
chopped parsley. 

CARROT PUREE. No. i. 

Steam or cook the carrots with salt and as little water as 
possible. A small piece of lean bacon or cornbeef may be 
added for flavoring. When done, mash very fine with a potato 
masher. Flavor with butter and a little pepper and parsley or 
lemon. 

CARROT PUREE. No. 2. 

Prepare like the above, and add one potato to three medium- 
sized carrots. If the potatoes require less time to cook, add 
them when the carrots are half done. This preparation may 
be especially recommended for chronic invalids or for those 
who have a dislike for the sweet flavor of the vegetable. 

CREAMED CARROTS. No. i. 

Cook like carrot puree. When tender, make a butter sauce 
with the water; add parsley and hot cream, if desired. 

CREAMED CARROTS. No. 2. 

Cook like number one, thicken with flour or corn starch, 
and add some hot cream and parsley. Serve, like soup or 
vegetables, for breakfast or supper, with dry whole wheat or 
black bread. Butter is not required at the meal if cream is 
used. If the butter and cream are emulsified as in sauces, they 
are more wholesome. 



4 S VEGETABLES. 

PEAS. 

Wash the peas while in the pods, then shell. Boil the pods 
in a very little water for 15 minutes, then take out and put the 
peas to boil in the same water. Add a little salt and sugar 
when almost done. Prepare further like creamed carrots. 
Some people prefer them with no dressing except butter. 
Those who have difficulty in digesting starch and wish to cut 
out the bread at the meal may use sauces or cream dressings 
with their vegetables, especially in the winter. 

MIXED PEAS AND CARROTS. 

Put the peas on to boil, and when half done, add an equal 
amount of carrots which have been cut into half inch pieces. 
Prepare with a butter sauce like creamed carrots, and add 
chopped parsley. This will afford a perfect meal for dinner in 
spring or summer. A few bread or flour dumplings may be 
served with it. The latter should be cooked with the peas 10 
minutes before serving. Salted or smoked meats give them a 
good flavor. 

PEAS AND CODFISH (Saxon Dish). 

Cook the peas with a very little water, and add meat broth 
while they are boiling. Boil some fresh codfish in a separate 
saucepan, and when done remove the skin and bones, cut into 
pieces and mix with the peas. Prepare a butter sauce from 
the liquid remaining on the peas. Carrots may be added. 

PEAS WITH LAMB. 

Boil the lamb with sufficient water to cover it. Add salt and 
onion. When half done, put it to boil with the peas, which 
should have been boiled with water in, another saucepan for 
10 minutes. When meat and peas are done, remove the fat, 
thicken with flour and add the pea water to make a butter 
sauce. Flavor with parsley. Use the meat broth for soup or 
add the yolk of an egg or two, and serve in cups. 

MIXED VEGETABLES (Leipsiger Dish). 
Use asparagus tops, young French carrots, peas, and cauli- 
flower. Cook each vegetable separately with salt, in as little 



VEGETABLES. 49 

water as possible. When done, drain the water from each and 
use for soup. Mix the different vegetables in one dish and 
pour browned butter over them. Serve with Lobster Curry. 
A butter sauce may be prepared from the vegetable water in 
place of brown butter. Bread or flour dumplings may be 
served with it. Lean meat is also a good combination. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

Cauliflower should be avoided by those who have delicate 
stomachs, at the evening meal. It should be perfectly fresh 
and put into salted water for an hour before cooking, in order 
to take out any hidden insects. It should be boiled 20 to 30 
minutes; if steamed it takes a little longer. Flavor with salt 
and a little sugar while boiling. Serve with brown or melted 
butter and lemon, or prepare a butter sauce with soup stock 
and the yolk of an egg, or with cream. Season with pepper. 
Serve with chipped beef or grated cheese for breakfast, or 
with lean meat for dinner. Left over cauliflower may be baked 
in the oven with cheese or bread crumbs, and served for break- 
fast. Tomato sauce is also suitable as a dressing. Cold cheese 
is a better combination with the latter than cream sauce or 
baked cheese. 

STRING BEANS. 

They are very purifying and should be eaten often, by peo- 
ple of a bilious tendency. Select young string beans, pull off 
the string on each side and break in pieces an inch long. Boil 
in slightly salted water and prepare like green peas. They 
may be mixed with carrots. Ribs of beef or lamb can be 
cooked with them as described in recipe for peas. For other 
combinations, see "Boiled Mixed Dinners." 

SPINACH. 

This is also a very valuable vegetable. Besides being rich 
in iron and phosphates, it is laxative, and excellent as a medici- 
nal food for constipation. Wash it thoroughly. For a delicate 
stomach use the leaves only. Steep in as little water as possi- 
ble, chop very fine or rub through a colander; season with 
pepper, salt, lemon and butter, or prepare with a brown or 



5 o VEGETABLES. 

white butter sauce from soup stock, or spinach water. Gelatine 
may be used in place of soup stock by dissolving the gelatine 
in the vegetable water. Smoked or salted lean meat may be 
cooked with it for flavoring. Serve with eggs or lean meat. 

SPINACH (Saxon Dish). 

Boil in as little water as possible, and chop fine. Then chop 
fine some well watered salt herring or other salt fish. Prepare the 
spinach with a butter sauce made from soup stock, add the 
fish and serve on toast. Dried bread crumbs or browned flour 
mixed with butter, without the liquid, may be added to any of 
the green leaf vegetables. 

MUSTARD GREENS. 

Dandelions, yellow dock, horse radish tops and lettuce may 
be prepared in the same manner as spinach. 

OKRA. 

Wash and remove the stems. Boil in salted water for 40 or 
50 minutes. Prepare with a butter or cream sauce. 

STEWED CUCUMBERS. 

Wash and peel them. Then, cut into pieces and cook with as 
little water as possible, until tender. Serve with fish or lean 
meat for dinner, or with whole wheat or rye bread for break- 

CELERY ROOT. 

Wash and boil the roots with the skins. When tender, peel 
them and cut into slices. Prepare with a butter sauce made 
with soup stock or serve with French dressing. Flavor with 
parsley. BLACK CARROTS. 

Wash and scrape. Boil in salt water to which a little vine- 
gar has been added. Prepare with a butter sauce, or mash 
fine. Serve with tongue, croquettes or boiled beef. 

EGG PLANT. 

Cut in slices about an inch thick. Make a batter of eggs, 
salt and flour ; dip the slices of egg plant in the batter, and fry 
in hot fat. Serve with lean meat, for dinner or supper,'or serve 
with green salad for breakfast. 



VEGETABLES. 51 

STUFFED GREEN PEPPERS. 

Cut off the stem end and remove the seeds. Fill the peppers 
with a dressing such as is given, in recipes for bread dump- 
lings or meat croquettes. Place them in a baking dish with 
two tablespoonfuls of oil or fat ; when brown add a little flour 
and some soup stock, cover the dish and bake in an oven for 
about 50 minutes. The inner part of the peppers may be 
mixed with the filling. 

ONIONS. 

For stewing use small or medium sized onions. Boil them 
in salt water, drain off the water and serve with butter and 
lemon, or prepare a butter or cream sauce. They are best eaten 
for breakfast or dinner with some salted meat, and wheat or 

rve bread. 

RAW ONIONS. 

People who like onions and find they disagree on account 
of the strong acids, should grate them and mix thoroughly with 
sauces, or French or mayonnaise dressing. 

FRIED ONIONS. 

Chop the onions very fine in a wooden bowl. Then heat some 
butter and oil and fry them until light brown and pour over 
steak or mix with potatoes. 

PARSLEY. 

Chop enough to last for several days. Melt some butter and 
add the parsley, and let boil up once. When cold put on ice. 
This saves time, though it is best to prepare the parsley fresh 
for each meal. 

MUSHROOMS. 

Wash and dry them, then roll in flour and fry in fat until 
brown. Add some soup stock and steep until done. Cover 
well. If the stock is too thin, add a little browned flour; season 
and serve on toast. * 

RED CABBAGE. 

Wash and cut in quarters. Mince very fine and put on to 
boil in a little water ; let it cook for 20 minutes in earthen ware, 
then add three to five ounces of fat or oil, some vinegar, sugar, 
salt and caraway seed. Let all cook for several hours. A few

apples may be cooked with the cabbage and taken out when 
done. The latter may be served for breakfast. When the 
cabbage is done, thicken with browned flour and let cook 10 
minutes longer. Onion may be added if desired. A piece of 
salt pork is also a good addition in place of oil. 

WHITE CABBAGE. No. i. 
Prepare the same as red cabbage. 

WHITE CABBAGE. No. 2. 

Cut in quarters and boil in a little water with a small piece 
of lean salted smoked meat, or without meat. When tender, 
drain and serve with butter and the yolk of an egg and lemon, 
or with an egg sauce or tomato sauce. 

SPROUTS. 

Remove the outside leaves and put to boil in a little sail 
water. When tender, drain and season with butter and lemon. 
The yolk of an egg may be added. A butter or egg sauce is 
also good. 

COOKED CORN. 

Remove the leaves and put in cold salt water for 30 minutes. 
Then, boil for 20 minutes. Corn is best when eaten raw. It is 
very nutritious and will afford a perfect meal during the sum- 
mer with tomato salad and lettuce. 

CANNED CORN. 

Thicken the corn with flour and water. Add a small amount 
of hot cream and season with salt and pepper or a few spoon- 
fuls of tomato juice. If no cream is desired, drain off the 
liquid and thicken like butter sauce. Canned corn., being a rich 
and soft food, should not be mixed with many other 'foods at 
the same meal. It is more suitable for the morning or noon 
meal than for supper. 

KOHLRABI. 

Peel, slice thin, and stew in a very little water. When nearly 
done, add some hot soup. Prepare with a butter sauce. Chop 
fine some green leaves of the plant previously boiled and add. 
Serve with boiled beef. 



VEGETABLES. 53 

VEGETABLE OYSTER. 

Wash, scrape and boil in salt water until tender about 40 
minutes. Prepare with butter, milk or cream sauce, or mash 
fine and fry like potato balls. Season with lemon or pepper. 

TURNIP PUREE. 

Prepare like carrot puree. Cook with as little water as pos- 
sible. ROASTED TURNIPS. 

Prepare the same as roasted carrots. They combine well 
with mutton. FRIED PARSNIPS. 

Scrape, wash and cut in slices, lengthwise. Boil in salt 
water for 5 minutes, then drain and fry in smoking hot fat. 
They can be turned in batter if desired. They may be fried 
without cooking, like sweet potatoes. 

KALE. 

This is a desirable vegetable in cold weather. It is purifying 
and very valuable during the rainy season, in malarial districts. 
Remove the leaves from the stems, wash and boil in salt water, 
using as little water as possible. Chop very fine and prepare 
like spinach. A little smoked meat may be added. 

SQUASH. 

If young and tender it does not require peeling. Wash, cut 
into small pieces and steam. When done, mash fine and season 
with salt, pepper and cream, or butter, and a few drops of 
lemon. It may be cut in. slices and fried in oil, or dipped in 
butter and fried like egg plant. 

TOMATO PUREE. 

Cut some fresh, firm tomatoes into several pieces. Cook in 
a double boiler with as little water as possible. Rub through 
a sieve with a spoon or potato masher. From 3 to 6 ounces of 
thick puree is sufficient at a meal, for the average adult. For 
medicinal purposes, tomatoes may be eaten in large quantities. 

CANNED STEWED TOMATOES. No. i. 
They are more wholesome if not cooked. Place a can of 
tomatoes in hot water to heat, drain, off the liquid, and serve 
with meat, fish, eggs or cheese. The liquid may be kept for 
soup. 



5 4 VEGETABLES. 

STEWED TOMATOES. No. 2. 

Heat a can of tomatoes, thicken with flour and water, and 
let boil 10 minutes. Add some butter and flavor with onion, 
and small amount of sugar if desired. 

STEWED TOMATOES. No. 3. 

Prepare as number two, thicken with bread or cracker 
crumbs, instead of flour. 

STEWED TOMATOES. No. 4. 

Heat a can of tomatoes. Then heat some butter and oil in 
a flat saucepan, thicken with mixed flour, flavor with onion, add 
the tomatoes gradually, and let boil a few minutes. 

STUFFED TOMATOES. 

Wash the tomatoes and cut off the upper part with a sharp 
knife. Scrape out the pulp and fill the tomatoes with cold 
chopped meat mixed with onion and mayonnaise dressing. Gar- 
nish with lettuce and serve with bread and butter, or as an en- 
tree. 

SAUERKRAUT. 

Wash the sauerkraut in cold water several times. People 
with sensitive stomachs should boil it for a short time. Then 
drain off the water and put on to boil again. If no meat is 
served with it, use a few tablespoons of oil, lard, butter, or 
goose fat. Add onions and a little sugar or some apples for 
flavoring. Cook from one to two hours. Then add a little 
flour dissolved in cold water, or two raw grated potatoes. Re- 
move the apples before serving. The latter may be eaten for 
breakfast or supper. If the onions disagree, remove them be- 
fore serving. Good combinations with sauerkraut are: Pea 
puree, pork, bacon, liver, liver-pudding, white fish, and oysters 
stewed or fried. 

CABBAGE ROLLS. 

Wash some large cabbage leaves. Fill them with finely 
chopped left-over meat, mixed with eggs. (See recipe for 
croquettes.) Then tie the rolls together with a string. Steam 
in a shallow dish with as little water as possible. Serve with 
an egg sauce. Flavor with mace. 



VEGETABLES. 55 

POTATOES. 

Potatoes consist mainly of starch and water. They are more 
expensive than wheat, rye, oats, barley and corn. They should 
not be eaten oftener than once a day, or better three times a 
week. People who do hard physical or mental work should 
not eat potatoes at the noon meal. Fat meats, eggs, fish and 
greens combine well with potatoes ; if they are served with 
lean meat, some fatty substance in the form of butter, cream 
or gravy should be eaten with them. Fried potatoes are not 
wholesome. The best way to prepare them is to boil or bake 
them in the skins, or boil or mash them in cream or butter- 
milk. 

POTATO SALAD. 

Boil or steam some potatoes with their jackets on. When 
done, peel and slice them into a deep bowl while warm; then 
sprinkle over them a little salt, pepper, and finely chopped or 
grated onion, and pour over them some boiling hot vinegar 
diluted with one-half water and mixed with melted butter or 
oil. Cover with a saucer and shake well ; let stand for twenty 
or thirty minutes. If there is too much liquid, pour off some 
and mix the remainder with mayonnaise dressing and chopped 
parsley, if desired. 

SWEET POTATOES. 

Boil the potatoes in the jackets, let cool, peel, slice, and fry 
in one-half butter and one-half oil. Serve with cranberry sauce, 
lettuce, and lean meat. 

Sweet potatoes may be peeled and sliced in the raw state, 
and fried in half oil and half butter. Serve as above. They are 
very suitable for breakfast. 

CREAMED POTATOES. 

Select small potatoes and boil in the skins. Add some salt. 
When done, peel and cut into thin slices. Bring some milk 
to a boil, and thicken with corn starch dissolved in water, or 
prepare a butter sauce with butter, flour and milk. Add the 
potatoes and some finely chopped parsley. Serve with fish or 
salted preserved meat. 



56 VEGETABLES. 

CRUST POTATOES. 

Use small, imported German potatoes. Boil with the skins, 
peel and turn in yolk of eggs and rye nuts ; fry in oil and butter. 
Serve with sprouts, or spinach and meat. 

STEAMED POTATOES. 

Peel small sized potatoes, wash and put into a steamer or 
colander. When done pour into a dish, and mix with chopped 
parsley and fresh butter. Serve with fish. 

FRENCH FRIED POTATOES. 

Peel and cut into long strips or thin slices. Put into salt 
water on ice for half an hour. Fry in boiling oil. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Peel, wash, and boil or steam the potatoes ; when done, mash 
fine, and add some hot cream or cold butter-milk, and a little 
salt, also a piece of butter. 

MASHED SWEET POTATOES. 
Prepare the same as white potatoes. 

POTATO BALLS. 

Beat 2 eggs with an egg beater, mix with one cup of left- 
over mashed potatoes, shape into balls and fry in hot fat. Serve 
with bacon, fish, or sausage, for breakfast. 

POTATO PUDDING. 

Prepare the same as potato balls. Put the mass into a pud- 
ding dish and cover with rye nuts, grated cheese, or a beaten 
egg mixed with rye nuts, and bake half an hour. 

POTATO AND APPLE PUREE. 

Prepare as for mashed potatoes. Use apple sauce in place of 
u 'ilk or cream, mix well and add a liberal piece of butter. 
Serve with sauer roast, veal cutlets or sausage. It is good 
for breakfast with bacon. 



CHAPTER II. 



LEGUMES AND MEATS. 

BAKED BEANS. 

Pick over the beans carefully, wash and soak them in soft 
water as directed in chapter on legumes. If the beans are to be 
cooked with fat, scald or parboil the meat first, add it to the 
beans after they have cooked for about an hour. If the beans 
require long cooking, take the meat out when it is tender. 
When the beans are tender, pour them into a beanr-pot or 
round pan. cover the top with part of the fat meat cut into 
slices, or pour some cooking! oil over the beans, and add a few 
whole onions. Bake for about an hour. Onions and fat meat 
eaten at the same meal are liable to disagree, therefore serve 
the onions at another time, or use them only for flavoring pur- 
poses. 

BAKED LENTILS OR PEAS. 

Prepare in the same manner as baked beans. They require 
less fat for cooking, and are more palatable if served without 
neat than are beans. Onions are rich in oil, therefore if 
plenty of onions are used, the meat is not missed so much. 
In cooking legumes, it is best not to add the salt until they are 
nearly done, because the salt hardens the water. If legumes 
are preferred cooked instead of baked, it is better to add a 
thickening of flour and butter before serving, otherwise they 
may produce flatulent dyspepsia. 

Legumes lose their natural flavor and. stimulus in the drying 
and soaking process, therefore they are not palatable or easy 
to digest without some form of fat and appetizing raw salad, 
v/hich supplies the needed stimulant. Many people add sweets 
to legumes or make them more indigestible by adding ground 
nuts and other rich foods to them, as in many vegetarian 
dishes. Such foods are a dangerous burden to a weak stomach 



58 LEGUMES AND MEATS. 

and liver. Heavy protein foods require an acid medium for 
proper digestion and utilization. If legumes are used in the 
form of soups and purees, nothing should be added but a little 
flour, dry toast, fats, or raw vegetables. If we wish to be 
strict vegetarians we must live upon raw foods. If we wish 
to live on cooked foods, a moderate amount of meat is neces- 
sary for most people. 

LIMA BEANS. No. i. 

Soak some lima beans in soft water. Cook in a small amount 
of water with a little salt. When tender, dissolve some corn- 
starch with cold water and add to the beans ; boil for 10 min- 
rtes, then add a few tablespoonsful of hot cream and remove 
from the fire. Flavor with chopped parsley, if desired. Serve 
with frankfurter or other lean, smoked meats. Mashed or raw 
carrots are also a good addition. 

LIMA BEANS. No. 2. 

Prepare like the foregoing. Drain off the water and add 
a piece of butter, the yolk of an egg, a little lemon juice and 
parsley, if desired. 

LIMA BEANS. No. 3. 

Prepare like the foregoing. Drain off the water and prepare 
a butter-sauce, mix with beans and serve plain, or add the yolk 
oi an egg, a little lemon, and parsley. 

PEA PUREE. 

Soak y^ cup of dried green peas in soft water. Boil with I 
quart of water and i onion for about an hour. Bake in a bean- 
pot for 1 1/2 hours or longer; add more water if necessary. 
Keep the peas covered. When done run through a colander 
and add i teaspoonful of butter. This makes about ^4 of a 
cup of puree. One-third of this portion is sufficient for a sick 
person or a young child. Serve on toast, or with raw carrots, 
or cold fat meat. 

BEAN AND LENTIL PUREE. 

Prepare and serve like the foregoing. A small veal or mut- 
ton bone may be boiled with it. The puree must not be greasy. 



MEATS. 59 

SOUR ROAST. 

Let a quart or less of vinegar come to a boil, dilute it with 
one-half the amount of boiling water, add some bay leaves, 
cloves, whole pepper, onions, or any other flavoring, and pour 
over a piece of beef (rump piece) which has been slightly 
rubbed with salt. Let it stand for several days. Then take 
it out of the liquid, cover with bacon or suet, and put into hot 
fat. After it has roasted for a while, stir a large tablespoonful 
of flour into the fat, add some water, and the spiced herbs. 
Cover well, and let it roast two or three hours. Add water or 
buttermilk to the gravy, if desired. Serve with potato dump- 
lings, lettuce and stewed prunes. 

VEAL CUTLETS. 

Sprinkle some lemon juice over the chops, then beat up sev- 
eral yolks of eggs, turn the chops in them, dip in rye nuts and 
fry in hot fat for ten minutes. Serve with lettuce and toma- 
toes, or with boiled potatoes, lettuce, stewed prunes or apple 

CHICKEN IN GELATINE. 

Put a small veal bone to boil with the chicken. When ten- 
der, take a part of the broth, add some vinegar to it, boil for 
ten minutes with onions and spiced herbs. Cut the chicken 
into pieces, place in a deep bowl, and pour the hot broth and 
vinegar over it. Cool and serve the next day. Use about ^ 
cup of vinegar to i quart of broth. 

Another way is to pour pure, hot vinegar over the meat in 
the bowl, let it stand an hour or longer, then pour off the vine- 
gar, and pour enough broth on the meat to cover it. Meat 
preserved in this way will keep on ice or in a cool place for a 
week. The meat and gelatine may be brought to a boil again 
at the end of the week. This will preserve it for a longer time. 
Goose may be prepared in the same manner. 

LAMB OR PORK IN GELATINE. 

The loin is the best part for this purpose. Prepare with veal 
bone like chicken. 

PORK CUTLETS. 
Prepare the same as veal cutlets. Fry with plenty of onions. 



60 MEATS. 

KIDNEY HASH.

boiling water and boil in the soup together with a soup bone. 
When done, mince fine and prepare with a brown flour gravy. 
Serve on toast. TRIPE 

Cut into small pieces and boil with a very little water, and 
a pinch of salt. When done, add some sweet whey or tomato 
juice. Heat some butter or oil, thicken with flour and add the 
liquid gradually, as for butter sauce. Season with chopped 
parsley. HAMBURG STEAK. 

Grind some round steak in a meat grinder. Shape into flat 
c;>kes and fry in, hot fat with plenty of onions. Turn from side 
to side while frying. 

STEAMED LIVER. 

Liver must be fresh in order to be wholesome. During hot 
weather it may become dangerous as a food after it is one day 
old. Remove the toxic blood by placing the liver in water or 
sour milk for one hour. Change the water several times. 
Then remove the skin and tie some bacon or suet over it. Roll 
in flour and steam in fat for 20 minutes. Then, add sufficient 
boiling water to half cover the meat. Flavor with bay leaves, 
salt, pepper and plenty of onions, also add a little vinegar and 
sugar, and steam for about an hour. Keep the saucepan well 
covered. Serve with potatoes or with apple and lettuce salad. 
The gravy can be strained and used the next day for breakfast 
or supper. See recipe for flavoring of sauces. 

HASH. 

Chop fine any kind of left-over, cold meat. Mix with one- 
third portion of grated or mashed potatoes, and add plenty of 
finely chopped onion and parsley. Brown some flour and but- 
ter, add a little soup stock and mix with the meat. Cook and 
serve on toast or with salad of greens. 

FRIED CALVES' LIVER. 

Slice the liver and put in cold water or sour milk for at least 
an hour. Change the water several times, then dry the liver

third dried bread-crumbs, a little salt, pepper and mace. Then 
add several beaten eggs, mix well, form into balls, roll in egg 
and cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot fat. Drain on paper or in 
a wire sieve. TO NGUE IN GELATINE. 

Fresh left-over tongue. may be kept for a while by preserving 
it in gelatine with veal bone. 

BRAINS. 

Brains are very nutritious, but they are not a wholesome 
food for people with chronic indigestion. They should be 
served on dry toast and eaten with sour salads of fruits and 

SALISBURY STEAK. 

Secure some fresh, thick, sliced, round steak. Scrape, or 
grind in a meat-cutting machine, and mould into flat, round 
Cokes. Have an iron spider very hot and oiled to prevent stick- 
ing. Lay the meat cake in, and turn from side to side till 
cooked sufficiently. 

CREAMED CHIPPED BEEF. 

Bring to a boil some soup stock from veal or mutton bone, 
thicken with cornstarch or white flour, boil 10 minutes, and add 
one-quarter or one-third part of hot cream. Cut or chop the 
dried beef fine, pour over it some boiling water, let stand a 
minute, then drain, and mix the beef with the cream gravy. 
Add a pinch of pepper, if desired. In place of cream, milk and 
butter may be substituted and prepared like butter sauce. 

BREADED GOOSE. 

Use goose which has been cooked in sour gelatine. Take 
the pieces out of the bowl and warm in order to remove the

gelatine. Then beat up several yolks of eggs, turn the meat 
in it, then roll in flour or rye nuts, and fry in hot fat. Serve 
with apple sauce or tomato puree. 

HAM HASH. 

Take equal parts of mashed potatoes and finely chopped 
boiled ham. Mix with several well beaten eggs and fry in the 
form of a large flat cake. Serve with macaroni. 

MEAT CAKE. 

Soak some stale bread in cold water. Press out very dry 
and mix fine. Add some finely chopped onions, parsley, and 
a little pepper, and mix with one-third or one-half of finely 
chopped left-over or fresh meat. Mix all well and shape into 
a loaf. Bake in an oven with moderate heat. Add boiling 
water and fat. Baste occasionally, and bake one hour. When 
done, thicken the gravy with a little flour. Serve for dinner 
with salad of greens. 

SMALL MEAT CAKES. 

Prepare the same as the foregoing. Shape into small balls 
and fry in hot fat. TURKEY 

Wash and clean the turkey, stuff it with tart apples, cut into 
quarters, to which a half cup of dried currants and half cup of 
bread-crumbs or rye nuts have been added. Sew it up, flavor 
and cover with sliced salt-pork or bacon. Fill the pan one- 
third full of boiling water, add onions, cover and roast from 
two to three hours. Add more water, if necessary. Serve with 
cranberry sauce. Use the gravy left in the pan the next day, 
with steamed potatoes or rice, for breakfast or dinner. 

TURKEY STEW. 

Cut off the wings, neck, and legs, before roasting the turkey. 
Put to boil with a small veal bone, add the giblets and stew 
until tender. Prepare a butter sauce from the broth. Flavor 
with onion and parsley. 

TURKEY IN GELATINE. 
Prepare like turkey stew, and finish like chicken in gelatine. 



MEATS. 63 

RIBS OF PORK WITH APPLE FILLING. 
Prepare the same as turkey, sew the ribs together and roast 
two to three hours. 

STUFFED TURKEY NECK. 

Cut off the neck from a large turkey. Stuff it with a bread 
dressing to which the giblets, fat and liver of the turkey have 
been added. Roast it in the same pan with the turkey or pre- 
pare it for another meal. 

LIGHT BREAD DRESSING FOR TURKEY 

OR CHICKEN. 

Remove the crust from a small loaf of graham bread. Crum- 
ble up the soft part and mix with chopped parsley, onion-, gar- 
lic, thyme, marjoram, sage, salt, one well beaten egg and one- 
half cup of finely chopped fat of the bird, or suet. This is suffi- 
cient for an 8-pound turkey. This dressing is especially good 
for people with delicate stomachs. 

BOILED BACON. 

Select firm, eastern bacon. Wash* thoroughly with cold and 
warm water. Let it come to a boil, throw away the water and 
pour on some fresh water. Boil about an hour. Let it cool 
on a platter and use the next day. Warm, fat meat is not 
v.-holesome for a delicate stomach. 

FRIED BACON. 

Parboil the bacon for one-half hour. Follow directions for 
boiled bacon. Let it cool and slice for frying. If the bacon is 
preferred raw, pour some boiling water over sliced bacon, let 
stand 5 minutes, pour off the water and fry or broil in the oven. 

LEAF LARD. 

Chop some leaf lard very fine and let it stand in cold water 
for several hours, or over night. Fry in an iron skillet, with 
apples and onions, until crisp and brown. Strain the lard into 
a bowl and serve the residue warm with stale black bread. 
Spread the lard on black bread. 

BACON FAT. 

Remove the fat from boiled or fried bacon, and spread on 
stale black bread. Combine with raw apples. This is good for 
breakfast. 



CHAPTER III. 

FISH, CHEESE AND EGGS. 

Fish should be cleansed as soon as it is caught, or directly 
after delivery from the market, and preserved with salt until 
ready for cooking. If the fish is to be fried, the salt should be 
washed off, the fish thoroughly dried and rolled in egg and rye 
nuts, or flour. If the fish is to be boiled, the salt should also 
be washed off, and the water for seasoning be flavored with 
spiced herbs. If more salt is necessary, add it to the water. 

BOILED FISH. 

Prepare as directed in the foregoing. 

Fish in gelatine can be prepared with veal bone as directed 
for chicken. For gravies with boiled fish, see chapter on 
"Sauces." 

SHELL FISH. 

Shell fish, as well as all other fish, should be eaten only when 
in season. People with chronic constipation and torpid liver 
should avoid shell fish because they are soft, and easily putrefy. 
Oysters and clams are a very valuable food for the sick, and 
also for the pregnant woman. They are rich in lime substances 
and nourish the glands of the body. They should be served 
in combination with lemon and greens, or be prepared with 
milk. 

PICKLED HERRING. 

Clean and wash the fish. Place in a colander and add salt. 
Let stand for several hours. Then, wash the fish and dry ; roll 
in flour and fry in hot fat or oil. Serve warm with lemon, or 
lay in a stone jar. Add a few bay leaves, whole peppers, and 
raw onions. Bring some vinegar to a boil with an equal 
amount of water, pour over the fish and add the fat in which 
the fish have been fried. If they are kept for several weeks, an 
extra amount of fat should be added for covering, so as to ex- 
clude the air. 



FISH, CHEESE AXD EGGS. 65 

FISH CAKES. 

Any left-over fish may be made into a nutritious dish for the 
morning, noon, or evening meal. 

Take equal quantities of finely chopped fish and grated po- 
tato, beat up several eggs with a little salt and pepper, add some 
thick cream, and flavor with grated onions. Form into balls 
with a tablespoon and fry in hot fat. Serve with rice, or with 
a salad of apples, or tomatoes and lettuce. 

CODFISH CAKES. 

Take one-third of shredded or finely chopped codfish .with 
two-thirds of grated potatoes; prepare as in the foregoing 
recipe. 

COTTAGE CHEESE. 

Put some whole, or skim milk, into a pan and set in a cool 
room, which has plenty of fresh air. Do not cover the Dan. If 
the room is exposed to dust, put a few long sticks over the pan 
and cover with a cheese-cloth. When the milk begins to get 
thick, set the pan into a larger pan with warm water, and keep 
it in a warm place or in the oven until the curd separates; it 
must not become hard. Then put a cheese-cloth on a colander 
and pour the milk into it. Let stand for several hours, until 
the whey is thoroughly drained off. Then chop fine some green 
peppers or onions, mix with the cheese, add a little salt and 
pepper, and serve with apple or potato salad or spread on sand- 
wiches. A few teaspoonsful of sugar and caraway seed may 
be added in place of the onion and pepper. 

SOFT BOILED EGGS. 

Put the eggs into cold water, place on the stove, and when 
the water begins to boil, the eggs will be done. 

BOILED EGGS. No. 2. 

Pour boiling water over them and let stand on a hot stove for 
10 minutes. 

BOILED EGGS. No. 3. 

Pour boiling water over the eggs and let them stand on a hot 
stove for 15 to 30 minutes. 



66 EGGS. 

SCALLOPED EGGS. 

Prepare a plain white sauce, mustard or horse-radish sauce. 
Cut some hard boiled eggs in halves, pour the sauce over them. 
Serve with potatoes. 

OMELET. 

Mix a tablespoonful of flour with a half cup of warm milk or 
water, and a little salt. Beat up two eggs, mix well with flour 
and water, then pour into a hot pan in which some butter has 
been melted. Cover and bake on, the stove with moderate heat 
for eight or ten minutes. Turn if desired. Serve with lettuce 
and fruit sauce. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS. 

Beat together one-half cup of soup stock, milk or water, and 3 
eggs. Add one-half tablespoonful of flour and mix well. A 
little chopped, cold, salted meat may be added. Pour all into 
a hot pan with melted butter, and stir until it is stiff. 



CHAPTER IV. 

SOUPS. 

LEGUME SOUPS. 

Soups prepared from legumes, fruits or cereals require an 
addition of fat in the -form of butter, oil, the yolk of an egg, 
cream, or fat meat. 

A soup of peas, beans, corn or lentils may be prepared from 
left-over food or fresh cooked legumes. To one cup of cooked 
legumes add three to five cups of hot water or weak soup stock, 
boil or mix well, then strain. Heat one or two tablespoonsful 
of butter or half butter and half cooking oil, add to this one 
or two tablespoonsful of mixed flour, let boil, then add the hot 
broth at short intervals, stirring to prevent lumps. When all 
the broth -is used, let the whole boil a few minutes. Remove 
from the fire, flavor with lemon juice, pepper, bay leaves, 
chopped fresh thyme, sage or parsley, and serve. 

To these soups an addition of hot cream may be made be- 
fore serving, if desired. They form a perfect and an economical 
meal without the addition of meat, eggs, fish or other protein 
foods. Celery, lettuce, raw apples and crackers with butter are 
a good addition. They should be well masticated, and the soup 
eaten with them very slowly. 

BEAN SOUP. 

AYash i^ cup of black, white red or mixed beans and soak 
in i quart of warm soft water over night. The next day add 
about 5 pints of cold or boiling water to the beans, let come 
to a boil ; add two finely cut onions and a potato, parsley or 
other flavoring. Then wash ^ pound o-f bacon several times 
with hot and cold water and put on to boil in sufficient water 
to cover it. Let boil 5 or 10 minutes, pour off the water and 
put the bacon into the bean soup. Let all boil for about an 
hour; when the meat is tender, take it out and put on a plate 
to cool. Let the soup simmer slowly for 3 hours or longer ; 



68 SOUPS. 

then strain. Let stand a little while, remove the fat and mix 
it with 2 or 3 tablespoonsful of flour in a clean saucepan over 
the fire, add the strained bean soup gradually, let all boil a few 
minutes and serve. If the soup is desired thin, use only a part 
of the fat and a little flour. A cupful of strained tomato juice 
and chopped parsley may be added before serving. This should 
make five soup plates full. Serve with fried bread or bread 
and butter and raw carrots. 

CREAM OF BEAN SOUP. 

Prepare like the foregoing. Leave out the meat, butter, 
flour, and tomatoes; mix with one-fifth part or less of hot

CHAPTER VI. 
BREADS, CAKES AND PUDDINGS. 

POMPERNICKLE OR BLACK BREAD. 
Prepare a sponge with a pint of white flour, three-fourths of 
a yeast cake, a little salt and sugar, and a pint of warm water. 
When light, add two quarts of rye meal, a tablespoonful of salt 
and about one quart of water. Mix well, and let rise over 
night. The next morning add about one quart of warm rye 
meal, and one of white flour; knead the dough for at least one- 
half hour. Let rise again, knead a little more, and shape into 
loaves. When light, bake in a hot oven, for about an hour. 
Pure rye meal may be used in place of one-fourth white flour. 

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD. 

Prepare the same as black bread. Use whole wheat flour 
in place of rye meal. 

LIGHT WHOLE WHEAT BREAD. 
Make a sponge from one cupful of luke warm water and one 
cake of yeast, with enough white flour to make the thickness 
of sponge cake. Cover and set in a warm place, about 90 de- 
grees F. When foamy, add about three pints of luke warm 
water, or milk which has been scalded and cooled to luke warm, 
about two teaspoonsful of salt, a little sugar and a piece of 
butter or fat. Stir into it with a spoon sufficient white flour 
to make it of the same consistency as the first sponge. Beat it 
from 10 to 15 minutes, dust the top with flour, and put it into 
a warm place to rise. When light, add enough whole wheat 
flour to make a stiff dough. Put it on bread-board with flour 
to prevent sticking, knead for half an hour or longer, and let 
it rise again. When light, shape in loaves without kneading, 
put into pans and prick top with a fork several times. When 
sufficiently raised, bake in hot oven for about an hour. Cover 
top with pieces of oiled paper, the first 20 or 30 minutes. When 
done, put the bread on a sieve or in towels to cool. 



BREAD AXD CAKES. 85 

LIGHT GRAHAM BREAD. 
Prepare in the same manner as light whole wheat bread. 

WHITE BREAD. 

Prepare the same as whole wheat bread, using pure, rich 
milk, cream and water, or sweet whey. Add a large piece of 
butter or cocoanut. Use white flour instead of whole wheat, 
mix it with one-fourth white corn meal, or rice flour. 

COFFEE CAKE. 

Prepare the same as white bread, using less flour, and add 
a few well beaten eggs, the grated rind of several lemons and 
oranges, or flavor with nutmeg, dried fruit, vanilla, mace or 
bitter almonds. Serve with fresh, sweet milk, or with scalded 
milk, as a whole meal for supper. 

All breads and cakes made with yeast are more nutritious 
and wholesome when stale, on account of the evaporation of 
water and the changes which take place in the bread. They 
should be kept in tins with holes on all sides, to allow a perfect 
circulation of air. The tins should be placed in the sunlight, 
or on a high, dry place near a stove. In many foreign countries 
pompernickle is kept for many months during the winter by 
placing it on top of high stone ovens near the ceiling. It 
finally assumes a sweet taste similar to that of nuts. 

Bread and cake may be kept sweet and free from mildew 
for a long time in the following way : Cut it with a sharp knife, 
when about four days old, into slices about one inch thick, 
then place it on a large, wire screen in the hot sunshine, cover 
with a cheese cloth, and let it lie for several hours, turning each 
slice until thoroughly dry. Then place the slices in an upright 
position in a square box made of wire screening, and keep in a 
dry or sunny place, covered with a light cloth. The box may 
be placed in the sunshine several times a week. 

ROMAN MEAL BREAD. 

Prepare the same as whole wheat bread, and use Roman 
meal instead of whole wheat flour.

ful of salt; add the eggs and beat with an egg beater until all 
is very light. Pour the mixture into the pans, filling two-thirds 
full, and bake in a quick oven. This will make about eight 
pop-overs. 

BRAN MUFFINS.

and a little rum to make a paste which is not very stiff. Roll 
ir several times, then cover and put it in the ice box for an hour. 

SAND TART. 

Mix one-half pound of white flour and one-half pound of rice 
powder, or wheat starch. Keep in a warm place. Melt one

CHAPTER VII. 
SAUCES AND SALAD DRESSINGS. 

SAUCES. 

Sauces are a necessary addition to cooked foods, especially 
in cold weather. The proper utensils used for sauce making 
are wooden spoons and flat, round bottomed saucepans. 

Good fresh butter, oil and dry flour are necessary to make 
nutritious sauces. Flour for thickening should boil at least 
ten minutes. If the flour is to be cooked with fat before the 
liquid is added, only a few minutes of boiling is necessary, for 
the reason that fat, when boiled, reaches a higher temperature 
than water or milk. Mixed flour is preferable to pure wheat 
flour. Sauces prepared from soup stock, vegetables or fruits 
and gelatines are a better addition to meats than brown gravies, 
which are prepared from the small amount of juice which is 
extracted from the meat by roasting. Sauces prepared in tke 
latter way are too rich as a food if eaten in combination with 
meat; they are a perfect meal by themselves if eaten in com- 
bination with whole wheat bread and greens. 

BUTTER SAUCE. No. i.

utes. Flavor with salt, onion, chopped parsley, celery, nutmeg, 
bay leaves, anchovy-paste, lemon, chopped salted meat or what- 
ever flavor is desired. Serve with meat or fish.

Fry until brown. Pour the fat into a stone jar and put the 
bacon on a plate. Mix a tablespoonful of the bacon fat and one 
- f butter with a tablespoonful of flour, and add hot water, whey, 
or soup stock. Flavor with chopped parsley or strained tomato 
juice and add the bacon. 

FLAVORING OF MEATLESS SOUPS AND SAUCES. 
Soups and sauces prepared with flour and water may be im- 
proved by an addition of left-over meat gravies or with crisp 
bacon and flavored with finely cut onions.

Prepare like white wine sauce. Add a little more sugar, and 
a teaspoonful of brandy, if desired. 



SALAD DRESSINGS FOR MEATS, CEREALS, FISH, 
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS. 

They can be prepared from oil, butter, eggs, cream. or nut 
butter. Dressings prepared from nut butter are especially good 
during the summer months. They can be prepared by making 
a plain butter sauce with flour and water, and adding nut butter 
before serving, or by diluting nut butter with water to the 
desired consistency. They may be flavored with orange or 
lemon juice. If a sweet flavor is desired, boil a little water 
with sugar, then add the juice of lemon or oranges and -mix 
with nut butter. Serve hot or cold. 

FRENCH DRESSING. 

Mix three tablespoonsful of olive oil with one of vinegar, or 
.vith the juice of one lemon and one grated onion. To this 
may be added sugar, pepper, salt, parsley or mustard, if de- 
sired. The proportion of oil and vinegar may be changed ac- 
cording to the taste. For fruit salads, lemon should always be 
used instead of vinegar. For raw vegetables, the dressing 
should not be poured over the salad until ready to serve.

CHAPTER IX. 
GELATINES AND TOASTS. 

GELATINE PREPARATIONS. 

Gelatine is a valuable food for the sick. The nutritive value 
of gelatine is under-estimated. While it alone cannot sustain 
life, it is superior to beef tea, and if eaten with other articles 
which supply the elements which it lacks, it can partially take 
the place of meat and other nitrogenous foods for sick people 
and for people of sedentary habits. For people who do hard 
labor gelatine is of little value. 

FRUIT GELATINE. 

To prepare fruit gelatine the acid and super-acid fruits are 
best, and no more sugar should be used than is necessary. 
Gelatine preparations must be kept on ice, or in a very cold 
place, and not be prepared in large quantities, as they easily 
putrefy. For the sick and for children, it should not stand 
longer than twenty-four hours, and it should not be kept in 
metallic dishes. The best time to serve gelatine is for the 
evening meal. It may be served wtih sterilized cream, and 
zwieback or wafers. 

Prepare some gelatine according to directions on package. 
Add to it juice from preserved apples, cherries, raspberries, 
strawberries or currants. 

GELATINE PUDDING MADE WITH SOUR MILK. 
Prepare some white gelatine with two cups of water. Take 
twice the amount of gelatine directed and add one-half cup of 
sugar. Remove from the fire, cool slightly, then add two 
cups of sour milk which has been beaten, and mix all well. 
Flavor and set in a cool place. Serve with sweet cream and 
zwieback. 

WHIPPED SOUR MILK. 

Beat one quart of thick, sour milk with an egg beater for 
10 minutes. Serve with zwieback in soup plates. Three-fifths 



U2 GELATINES. 

tablespoonful of powdered sugar and a little cinnamon may 
be added, if it is agreeable. 

Whipped sour cream may be prepared the same as sour milk. 

WHIPPED SWEET CREAM. 

Whip one quart of sweet, thick cream with two-fifths of a 
tablespoonful of powdered sugar, add a little vanilla, if desired. 
Serve with fruit gelatines or ground white figs, stewed prunes, 
baked apples or raw fruits, such as peaches, strawberries, rasp- 
berries or bananas. 

BANANA GELATINE. 

Prepare some gelatine with orange, cranberry or lemon 
juice. When nearly cold, cut up some bananas and mix with 
the gelatine. Flavor and set on ice, serve with whipped or 
sterilized cream. 

PINEAPPLE GELATINE. 

Prepare some gelatine with lemon or orange juice. When 
nearly cold, add some fresh or canned pineapple. Serve with 
whipped or sterilized cream, and zwieback. 

BEER GELATINE. 

Prepare with rye beer in the same way as the fruit juice. 
Take one pint of beer to one pint of water. Use the imported 
root beer. BLANC MANGE 

Prepare some gelatine with milk, sugar and a little salt. Re- 
move from the fire, set on ice, and mix with boiled custard when 
cool. Flavor with vanilla or bitter almond. 

CALVES' FOOT JELLY. 

Wash a calf's foot several times in hot and cold water. Bring 
to a boil and pour off the first water. Bring to a boil again, 
add some salt, and cook from two to three hours. Strain 
through a cheesecloth. The next day remove the fat, bring 
to a boil again, add one to two cups of wine, the juice and rind 
of several lemons or oranges, and sufficient sugar to counter- 
act the sour taste. Pour into a dish which has been oiled, and 
set on ice. It may be served with whipped cream or the beaten 
whites of eggs, and shredded wheat or zwieback. 



GELATINES. 113 

SNOW PUDDING. 

Soak some gelatine according to directions. Add a pint of 
boiling water, some tart fruit juice and the necessary amount of 
sugar. Let it come to a boil, stir and strain, and let stand in a 
cold place for several hours. When it begins to set, beat up 
the whites of two eggs with a little salt or lemon juice, and 
sugar, and mix with the gelatine. Pour into molds and set on 
ice. Serve with whipped cream or custard sauce. 

RICE GELATINE. 

Boil one cup of rice in about three pints of water with a 
little salt, for 40 minutes. Soak gelatine, half the amount di- 
rected on the package, and when soft, add the strained rice 
water to it, bring to a boil, sweeten to taste, and put into molds 
or cups. Serve with whipped or sterilized cream and zwieback. 
Merk's sugar of milk should be used if prepared for the sick.

to the boiling point, adding lemon or salt, if desired. Put into 
molds and set in a cool place. Serve with cold meat or fish, 
olives and greens. 

BARLEY GELATINE. 

Prepare like rice gelatine. Half rice and half barley may be 
used. Dried raisins or currants may be added, if desired. 

WHEAT GELATINE. 

Cook three tablespoonsful of Cream of Wheat with two or 
three pints of water and some salt. Boil 20 to 30 minutes. 
Strain and prepare like rice gelatine. Flavor according to 
desire. If the rind of a lemon is used, boil with the gelatine. 
This gives it an excellent flavor. 

BUCKWHEAT GELATINE. 

Wash the buckwheat groats several times with cold water, 
then soak or put into boiling water at once. Boil from 30 to 40 
minutes. Flavor to taste. Finish like the foregoing. It is 
very good during the winter. 



II4 GELATINES. 

OAT GELATINE. 

Wash and soak one cupful of steel cut oats in two quarts of 
water. Add some bran, if desired. Boil 30 to 40 minutes with 
a little salt, and drain and strain. Do not press the starch 
through. Prepare like rice gelatine. 

BRAN GELATINE. 

Soak one cupful of bran in three pints of soft water for sev- 
eral hours, or over night; one-half cupful of rylax or black 
crusts may be added. Bring to a boil slowly and let simmer 
for 15 or 20 minutes. Soak some gelatine, a little less than the 
directions call for. Add the strained bran juice and a few 
dried currants which have been soaked in boiling water. If 
sugar is desired, add a small tablespoonful. Let it come al- 
most to the boiling point, add salt, and put into molds. Serve 
plain or with sterilized cold cream. 

RYE GELATINE. 

Prepare like bran, gelatine, using less bran. Toast thorough- 
ly brown three or four slices of stale pompernickel and soak 
with the bran. If boiling water is used for soaking, less time 
will be required for it. A stick of cinnamon gives the rye a 
good flavor. Rylax may be used in place of pompernickel. 

PEA GELATINE. 

Wash and soak over night one cupful of whole dried green 
peas in three pints of soft water. The next day let them slowly 
come to a boil and add cut-up onions, carrots, celery or parsley, 
and salt if desired. Simmer slowly in earthen ware for one 
hour at least. Strain and prepare with gelatine as directed in 
the foregoing. Do not press the peas hard through a strainer; 
allow only a little pulp in the broth. Serve with zwieback 
spread with almond butter or with a little finely ground walnut 
meat. 

COFFEE GELATINE. 

Pour two pints of boiling water on four or five tablespoons- 
ful of coarsely ground coffee. Steep (not boil) for five min- 
utes, then strain. Soak some gelatine according to directions 



GELATINES. 115 

on package. When soft, mix with the hot coffee, add sugar 
to suit the taste, and let it come almost to the boiling point. 
Mix well and pour into molds or cups, which have been rinsed 
in cold water. Serve with whipped or sterilized cream, and

VEAL JELLY. 

Veal jelly may be flavored in. many different ways. It is 
better to cook the stock with salt only. In this way the flavor 
can be changed each time by adding vegetable broth obtained 
by boiling vegetables in a small amount of water and straining. 
Onions are a very good flavoring. A great variety of vege- 
tables should not be used at one time. 

MALTED MILK. No. i.

i 3 4 FLUIDS. 

LEMONADE WITH EGG. 

Take some lemonade prepared from oranges and lemons and 
add to it the yolk or the whole of an egg. The acid taste must 
dominate the sweet taste. 

MILK EGGNOG. 

Beat up the whole or the yolk of an egg with a little water 
and some brandy, sherry, cognac or whiskey, and one or two 
teaspoonsful of sugar. To this add eight to ten ounces of rich 
raw or sterilized milk, or one-half cream and one-half water. 
Flavor with nutmeg or bitter almond.

Boil some water with a little sugar and the rind of a lemon, 
orange or apple. Add to it some preserved strawberry, cherry, 
pineapple, currant or raspberry juice, and seltzer water, or add 
a mixture of several different fruit juices. This is excellent 
for fever patients, but not for people suffering with lung or 
heart diseases. 

ALMOND MILK. 

Blanch one cup of almond meats, chop or grind them

MALT OR CEREAL COFFEE. 

Take one-half cup of instantaneous Postum or Kneipp's malt 
coffee, pour three or four cups of boiling water on it. Let stand 
from 5 to 15 minutes, then strain. Serve hot or cold, with or 
without cream. People who wish to leave off coffee may add

in warm soft water over night. The next day put on to boil 
in a quart of water, cook slowly for one hour or longer, and 
keep covered well. Then strain and serve plain, or add some 
hot cream to it. Small white and lima beans are excellent in 
the summer. 

PEA AND LENTIL TEA. 

Prepare the same as bean tea. Dry green peas are richer in 
minerals than yellow peas. Yellow peas contain more starch. 



CHAPTER I. 
FOOD REQUIREMENTS. 

It is important that the diet should contain the proper 
amount of protein, starches and fats, suitable to the individual 
needs. Age, weight, size, occupation, season and climate 
must all be considered. The majority of civilized men and 
women consume from two to three times the amount of food 
necessary. Numerous and careful researches regarding food 
requirements have been made during the last fifty years. 

The composition of American food materials and the dietary 
standards of Professors Voit and Atwater can be found on the 
last pages of this book. 

The recent experiments of Professor Chittenden, of Yale 
University, have demonstrated that 60 grams of protein, with 
the necessary amount of fats and carbohydrates to yield from 
1500 to 2500 calories per day, is sufficient. These requirements 
are regarded as presenting the minimum of what is necessary 
for the maintenance of health, strength and activity. To take 
more food than the body requires means not only waste of food, 
but an unnecessary strain upon the body, by this excess, which 
must be gotten rid of at the expense of energy, that could be 
more profitably expended for other purposes. 

The sample menus given on following pages are taken from 
the results of my own experimental work with different people, 
under different conditions, and of weights varying from 130 to 
160 pounds. They were people in poor health, suffering from 
lack of nutrition brought about by unsuitable food, such as too 
much protein or starchy foods ; insufficient fats and minerals 
in the -food ; excess of cooked foods ; improper combinations and 
wrong time for eating. Some improved in health and strength 
immediately after the change of diet, and were able to do from 



138 FOOD REQUIREMENTS. 

eight to twelve hours of active work, while others found it 
necessary to take a rest and develop their stomachs gradually 
by a change to raw foods. 

I am convinced that the amount of protein presented in the 
sample bills of fare is sufficient for the average individual, pro- 
vided the food is properly masticated, digested and assimilated, 
and not forced down by artificial stimulants and poisonous bev- 
erages. The amount of carbohydrates and fat required differs 
greatly with different temperaments and individual peculiari- 
ties, and must be determined by the individual himself. Those 
who can use a considerable amount of cereals and fruits re- 
quire less fat, while others who are not so well able to digest 
large amounts of starchy foods and fruits require more fats. 

Cooked foods are more easily digested than raw foods, but 
the nutritive value is very definitely influenced by the process 
of cooking; therefore it is important to consume as much food 
as possible in the raw state.

FOOD FOR THE AGED 



Many people at the ages of sixty and seventy still lead an 
active life, while others retire from activity at forty-five or fifty. 
Therefore, the food must conform to the person's mental and 
physical requirements. If the teeth are poor and the digestive 
powers are weak, the food should be light, consisting mainly 
of well cooked cereals, baked potatoes, rice, cooked greens, a 
small amount of meat, raw fruits and raw greens in combina- 
tion with fatty foods, as salads, milk and buttermilk, toasted 
breads and soups. The total fuel requirement depends upon 
whether the individual leads a quiet or active existence. For 
a person who lives mainly indoors, and makes little use of the 
muscles of the arms, shoulders and trunk, 1000 to 1200 calories 
is sufficient for twenty-four hours. If more food is eaten than 
the body requires, the excess will manifest itself by the develop- 
ment of chronic ailments and obesity, or feeble-mindedness. 

The morning and evening meals should consist of fluid and 
semi-fluid foods, or of toasted breads and salads. Meats, eggs 
(except the yolks), cheese, beans, peas and nuts should be 
eaten only during- the middle of the day in small quantities. 
One can cut down his amount of food greatly by thoroughly 
chewing each morsel. The demand for protein at this period 
is small, while the amount of fat should be increased. A few 
srmple bills of fare may be of assistance to those who wish to 
make a study of food requirements for themselves or for others.

CHAPTER II. 
DIET DURING PREGNANCY. 

A healthy woman will be guided by intuition, as to the selec- 
tion of food suited to her condition. Unfortunately, only a 
few women are properly matured in these days of forced edu- 
cation and unnatural occupations for young girls during the 
age of puberty. 

The craving of pregnant women for pickles, spices and cer- 
tain fruits out of season indicates an anemic condition. The 
individual longs for an article, of which her mind is most con- 
scious, to bring about satisfaction. 

Pregnant women, require a larger amount of phosphates, 
lime and other minerals in their food, especially during the 
first four months. The amount of food taken should be rather 
less in quantity: and the starches and sweets should be cut 
down as much as possible, unless the mother has to perform 
a large amount of physical work. 

Vomiting during the early months of pregnancy is generally 
due to excess of starches and indigestible foodstuffs. The 
eliminating organs not being able to throw off the excess 
of waste, the system rids itself of it through the effort of the 
liver, before the waste enters the blood stream. 

A suitable diet depends much upon the constitution of the 
mother. In severe cases of vomiting or headache, a diet 
should be prescribed by a physician. 

DIET FOR THE MOTHER AFTER LABOR. 
This is another important period for the welfare of the 
mother as well as of the infant. Improper feeding during the 
first month after the child is born is responsible for many 
nervous breakdowns of the mother, at the time when she 
should be in the best of health and ready to take charge of 
her infant. A healthy new born infant can stand an enormous 
amount of abuse in the matter of feeding before it is sent to 
an early grave, or before the foundation is laid for a life of 
long suffering. 



DIET DURING PREGNANCY. 151 

The mother's milk during the first month of the infant's 
life is richer in cream and sugar than in the later months. 
Therefore, such foods should be given as yield these ele- 
ments to the milk. The mother herself, having expended a 
large amount of energy, demands a food rich in lime, fats, 
sugar and organic salts. The physiological enlargement of the 
abdominal organs must be treated with great care. 

As a rule, no food is required during the first few hours 
except water. In exceptional cases where the mother is greatly 
exhausted, a glass of fresh milk or some warm stimulating food 
may be served. 

The food during the first four days should consist largely of 
strained water gruels, prepared from steel cut oats and bran, 
or from rolled wheat or cream of wheat. Stewed prunes, 
toast, soft boiled eggs or other egg foods should be served 
once per day at the noon meal. Fresh milk is best given dur- 
ing the afternoon or evening or at 10 a. m. A slice of toast 
may be served with it. If the milk of the mother is scanty, 
serve water gruels several times per day. If the mother has 
too much milk, fluid foods should be restricted and a dry diet 
adopted. After the fourth day add rice, baked potatoes, fish 
and a small amount of meat to the diet. Avoid drinking milk 
or other liquid food, except a little water with the dinner. If 
milk or broth is desired, take it at the beginning of the meal. 
Avoid artificially prepared desserts at the end of the meal. 
Use oranges or grapes as desserts, or a little black coffee and 
toast. 



Suggestive Menus for Breakfast during the First Week. 

1. Three-fourths of a pint of barley gruel with or without

The nursery should be well lighted and ventilated, and if 
possible be located on the southeast side of the house. The 
windows should be broad and not too low. The wall-paper 
should be a cheerful green, or blue with designs of lighter 
shades, and the rug of bro\vn or tan color. Avoid all bric-a- 
brac, useless curtains, and other hangings which tend to 
darken the room, gather dust and absorb odors. The furni- 
ture should be adapted to the size and needs of the child. 
During the first four years the meals are best served in the 
nursery, or at a time when the parents are not at the table. 
It avoids much unnecessary excitement and temptation, and 
if the child is under the constant care of the mother it will 
give her relief during these hours. All children between the 
ages of four and ten should have their evening meals served 
alone, or else be so well trained as not to expect to eat the same 
food as the adults. 



PREPARATION OF FOOD FOR INFANTS. 
MILK. 

In preparing modified milk or other fluid foods for infants, 
where top milk is used, it is very important that the milk con- 
tain the same amount of cream for each feeding, or else diges- 
tive disturbance and irregularity of bowel movements will 
occur. 

If milk, fresh from the cow and run through the cooler, is 
put into bottles or jars and kept at the same temperature, the 
same percentage of top-milk will be obtained daily. Five 
hours is generally sufficient to obtain the desired quality. 
The best means of removing it is by a spoon, or siphon. 



i 5 4 FOOD FOR INFANTS. 

If raw milk is used without being- sterilized, the desired 
amount for each meal should be put into sterile bottles di- 
rectly after delivery and lightly covered by cheese-cloth or 
cotton and kept on ice or other cold place. In this way each 
bottle will contain the same amount of cream. 

PREPARATION OF MODIFIED MILK (RAW). 

Put the desired amount of top-milk into as many bottles as 
are required for feeding during twelve hours. Prepare a 
solution of water and milk-sugar by dissolving the sugar with 
the desired amount of boiling water. Let cool and keep on 
ice for twenty-four hours. At each feeding, add the prescribed 
amount of water to the milk, shake and heat in, a water bath. 
Add a tablespoonful of lime water or barley water. If the milk 
cannot be obtained fresh twice per day, it is safer to scald the 
i.nlk which is used during the night. 

All milk, even if handled carefully, contains a large number 
of germs. When one is not certain that the cows from which 
the milk is obtained are healthy, the milk should be sterilized. 
During the summer it is safer to scald or sterilize all milk for 

infants. 

SCALDED MILK (MODIFIED). 

Dissolve the desired amount of milk sugar in boiling water 
in a clean saucepan, add the milk, stir over a quick fire until it 
foams, which means that the milk is heated to about 200 F. 
The most harmful germs are generally destroyed by this pro- 
cess. Pour the milk into a clean pitcher and set the latter in a 
pan of cold water. Stir the milk until cold and change the 
water several times. The stirring makes the milk homo- 
geneous and easier to digest. If any scum has formed on top, 
through careless preparation, the milk should be strained 
through a cheese-cloth before putting it into bottles. Put a 
cotton stopper in the bottles and set on ice. Milk prepared 
in this manner is generally suitable for the average healthy 
infant. 

STERILIZED MILK (MODIFIED). 

Dissolve the milk sugar as directed for scalding milk. Add 
the desired amount of milk, top-milk or cream, and prepare as 
directed in the chapter under "Sterilized Milk." 



FOOD FOR INFANTS. 155 

PASTEURIZED MILK. 

Put the desired amount of milk or milk and cream mixture 
into sterile bottles, put on a stopper and set in a water bath ; 
heat the water to 155 or 170 F., and keep it at that tempera- 
ture for 30 minutes. Then remove the bottles at once, cool 
them in a pan of cold water and set on, ice. 

BOILED MILK. 

Put the desired amount of milk, or modified milk, into a 
clean saucepan, stir over a hot fire and boil from 2 to 5 minutes. 
Then cool by setting the pitcher into a pan of cold water; stir 
until cold and set on ice. This is excellent for infants as well 
as for the sick who suffer with diarrhoea. The milk may be 
modified with arrow-root, barley water or rice flour gruel, 
which has been boiled with salt and water and a stick of cinna- 
mon. Milk-sugar should be boiled with the gruels, two level 
tablespoonsful to a pint of boiling water. 

ESKAY'S FOOD. 

Prepare as directed on label or use like the foregoing in 
place of arrow-root.

156 FOOD FOR INFANTS. 

DIRECTION FOR PREPARATION. 

Put the desired amount into a saucepan and scald, as di- 
rected under "Scalding Milk," or put into bottles and pasteur- 
ize or sterilize. 

If the bowels of an infant are too loose, lessen the amount 
of cream, and add more milk in place of it. If the child is 
constipated, add more cream and use less milk. If it disagrees, 
add oatmeal, rice, rye, barley or legume water. For prepara- 
tion, see "Teas," in. Chapter on Fluids. Use one-half the 
amount of water, as directed above, add the other half in the 
form of tea. Prepare the tea separately, and add the desired 
amount to each bottle when heating. Camomile tea is often 
beneficial for a few days. It can be added in the same manner 
as other teas, or given, without sugar or cream, when colic 
appears. The latter way is preferable to too much hot water, 
when the infant is suffering with colic. 

ORIGINAL RECIPE FOR DELICATE INFANTS. 

Mixture of Cream, Milk, Water, Milk-Sugar, Rice Flour and 
Pearl Barley (Condensed Milk, if Required). 

Dissolve two tablespoonsful of rice flour in a little cold 
water, stir into twelve ounces of boiling water, add one-fourth 
of a teaspoonful of salt, and boil for 20 minutes. Pour into a 
pitcher and keep on ice for 24 hours. Use. 

Soak one-fourth of a cup of pearl barley for several hours, 
or over night. Boil with a quart of water and a little salt for 
one and one-half hours. This will make about ten ounces of 
barley water when strained. Keep the barley water and rice 
flour gruel in separate pitchers. If an additional amount of 
condensed milk is found more agreeable, add one tablespoonful 
of Eagle Brand Condensed Milk to the barley water in place of 
milk-sugar, before straining it. 

Prepare the milk as follows : Dissolve two tablespoonsful 
of milk-sugar in ten ounces of boiling water, add four ounces 
of cream and four of milk, stir the milk and water in. a sauce- 
pan over a quick fire until it foams, and pour into eight clean 
warm bottles which have been set in a kettle of hot water. 
Put cotton stoppers in the bottles, and pour enough water into 



FOOD FOR INFANTS. 157 

the kettle so that it is even with the milk in the bottles. Let 
it stand on a hot stove and keep the water at the temperature 
of 170 to 200 F. for half an hour. Then set the kettle on the 
floor and when, the water is cold, remove the bottles and put 
them on ice. At each feeding, add one ounce of the prepared 
barley water, and a tablespoonful of rice flour gruel to the 
bottle ; shake well, and heat by setting the bottle in warm 
v,-ater. This will make about 28 ounces of food for 24 hours, 
or 31/2 ounces per bottle for eight feedings during 24 hours. 
This quantity is required for the average child during the 
second month. Ten feedings are generally required during 
the first month. 

During the first week of the infant's life use 5 ounces of 
cream, 5 ounces of water, 8 ounces of rice and barley water, 
and no milk. This makes 18 ounces of -food for 24 hours, or 
about 2^ ounces per bottle for ten feedings during 24 hours. 
If a larger quantity is desired during the first month, add 2^2 
ounces of water and 2 ounces of milk to the cream mixture, 
then gradually change to the proportion given in above for- 
mulas. As the child grows older, increase the amount of 
milk to 12 or 15 ounces until the age of ten months. After 
that age 42 ounces of food is required during 24 hours, and 
the child is generally able to begin with semi-liquid or solid 
food. The rice flour alone, or any other cereal gruel or water 
may be used in place of barley and rice, but the latter is found 
especially beneficial for delicate infants with whom plain modi- 
fied milk disagrees. 

It is often desirable to change the cereal occasionally. Use 
oats, rye and barley during the winter and the lighter cereals 
during the summer. Other suitable foods for the infant are 
bran or rye tea with or without milk or cream, and broths from 
veal or mutton with the yolk of an egg (10 ounces of broth to 
one yolk). Strained steel cut oats and bran are excellent for 
a while where milk or cream are found to disagree. 

During the period from the tenth to the fifteenth month the 
healthy infant requires an addition of solid food. The appear- 
ance of the teeth indicate when it should begin. The change 
must be made gradually from liquid to semi-liquid and finally 
to solid food. The middle of the day is the best time to begin 



i 5 8 SECOND PERIOD. 

with the change of food. Lean meat is not a necessary food 
for children, therefore it is -mentioned only occasionally for 
those who think their children must have it. On, the other 
hand, legumes are a very important food for young children, 
and their use should begin during the second year. They are 
easily digested if prepared in the form of soups and purees, and 
combined as directed in the different menus. They should not 
be given at night. 

SECOND PERIOD: FROM THE TENTH TO 
THE FIFTEENTH MONTH. 

During this period the infant should sleep three times dur- 
ing the day: From 8 to 10 a. m., from i to 3 p. m., and from 6 
to 8 p. m. If the child should not awaken for the last feeding 
and sleep until 4 or 5 a. m., give the feeding at 4 a. m. instead 
of between 8 and 10 p. m. If it should be in the habit of 
awakening during the middle of the night, change the habit by 
awakening it at 10 p. m. Reduce the quantity of milk given 
at this time gradually to 3 or 4 ounces, and finally replace it by 
water. 

If the child should sleep from 6 p. m. to 6 a. m. without 
awakening, it does not require the extra feeding; four meals 
are sufficient. 

Some children require five meals until they are two years 
old. With intelligent study and simple regularity the mother 
can make her work very easy. She can transform delicate 
children into strong, vigorous ones, avoid disease and many 
unnecessary doctor bills. 

Do not begin, the habit of stuffing the child with bread and 
crackers every time it cries. If it desires something to bite 
upon give it a teething-ring. Give the child as many meals 
as it requires, but avoid feeding between meals. Give it cold 
or slightly warmed water between meals. Do not force the 
child to drink water. If fed correctly it will call for the neces- 
sary amount of water. If a child is too heavy in. weight for 
its age, reduce the amount of milk. Give it strained oatmeal, 
bran and barley gruels, with butter or cream. Some children 
require three pints of milk during 24 hours, between the tenth 
and fifteenth months, while others are satisfied with one and 



MENUS FOR THE SECOND PERIOD. 159 



one-half pints of milk and four to six ounces of cream. If 
broths or other nutritious liquids are substituted for milk, the 
amount of milk required for the day would be less than that 
mentioned above. Never force the child to eat food; when it 
awakens in the morning it generally requires food immediately. 
When it awakens for its dinner, let it play for a while until it 
calls for food. If it refuses food, leave out a meal once in a 
while, or reduce the number of meals to suit the appetite.

Some children are able to digest all the above mentioned 
foods before they are three years old ; others are not. Certain 
foods are agreeable to certain, temperaments and disagreeable 
to others. No exact rules can be laid down. Reason and judg- 
ment must guide the mother in the selection of foods as well 
as in other details. 



164 GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 

Unleavened crackers, raw cereal flakes and stale sundried 
pompernickle or whole wheat bread are the best dry cereal 
foods for children. If cooked cereals are served, crackers and 
wheat bread are not necessary at the same meal. A few black 
crusts or raw vegetables combine better with cooked cereals. 

Soda crackers or thoroughly toasted unsweetened zwieback 
may be given occasionally for the evening meal in combina- 
tion with sago, fruit gruels or jellies. 

Do not feed a child fresh breads and cakes which contain 
soda, yeast or baking powder. 

A child over three years of age may eat occasionally unleav- 
ened fruit cake, pancakes and fruit tarts which are prepared 
with eggs. 

Never allow a child to eat ice-cream at the end of a heavy 
meal. Serve it at the beginning of the meal or during the 
afternoon. 

Four meals per day is generally the best plan for a child, 
as long as it sleeps during the day-time. If it is fed on plain, 
non-stimulating food it generally takes a nap up to the age of 
4 or 5 years, and sometimes later, while a child that is fed 
upon meats, beef juices, meat soups and excess of starch and 
sweets often refuses to sleep during the day-time at the age of 
two. 

Meats and sweets or excess of any kind of food irritate the 
sensitive nerves and produce restlessness and sleeplessness 
in the child, and much unnecessary work and sleepless nights 
of the mother. Any normal healthy child can be trained in the 
matter of eating, sleeping, evacuation of the bowels and in 
other details like clock-work, if the proper conditions are fur- 
nished. 

At the end of the third year the child may begin to eat well 
baked beans, peas or lentils several times per week during the 
winter, hey should be given at the noon meal, in combina- 
tion with raw or finely mashed carrots, or with a tomato salad 
and raw greens. No more than two tablespoonsful should be 
given at one meal. Systematic training in chewing is abso- 
lutely necessary for a good digestion. If legume foods should 



WRONG MANAGEMENT. 165 

cause gas on the stomach, they must be strained and given in 
the form of soups or purees. Walnuts may also be used. Give 
two or three at the end of the meal. For combination, see 
''Menus for Adults." The amount of food should be increased 
gradually. At the age of 12 or 14, a child may eat nearly as 
much as an adult. 

Moving picture shows, car and automobile rides require 
more nervous energy than strolling in the woods. Instead of 
supplying the system with plain nutritious foods, such as milk, 
nut preparations or wholesome sandwiches on such occasions, 
the excitable nerves are generally more stimulated by artificial 
foods : candies, cookies, sweet graham crackers, gums or by 
exhilarating (pure fruit?) lemonade or germ laden ice-cream. 

Artificial lights and amusements of this kind, associated with 
nerve starvation, cause much eye trouble in children. Think 
of the amount of nervous and muscular energy expended dur- 
ing those hours in comparison with walks or other kind of 
natural amusements ! 

If the chewing of gum, candies and other fancies is per- 
missible in cars and theatres, why not wholesome foods? A 
small satchel will hold an aluminum can with milk, a few 
napkins and other wholesome food products. If confectionery 
and ice-cream parlors and cheap restaurants were supplanted 
by hygienic food laboratories and pure water stands, saloons 
would soon be on the decrease. 

WRONG MANAGEMENT. 

The dyspeptic business men and women who have no time 
or power to digest a meal during the middle of the day are 
generally the victims of early habits acquired when at school. 

We cannot try to change the fixed and immovable laws of 
nature without paying the penalty. Nature will keep us in 
order and control our machine, if we fulfill her laws. The sun 
is in sympathy with our digestive forces; therefore we should 
rest from labor during the middle of the day, so that the 
muscles of the stomach may be able to give all the circular 
movements, and others that are necessary, to thoroughly mix 
the food with the stomach juices for rapid digestion. Solid 
foods of the protein class, can only undergo perfect digestion 



166 WRONG MANAGEMENT. 

if eaten in the middle of the day. They require many hours 
to digest, and in this way they are ready for oxidation and 
assimilation- at night, when the air is cool. The body can rest, 
and the lungs and heart can work better when the stomach 
is emptied. While on the other hand, if the heaviest meal is 
taken at night, it is either too rapidly digested by physical 
force, or it is left half digested in the stomach over night. It 
congests the liver and kidneys, produces fermentation, robs 
lungs, heart and skin of their nerve force, and creates an ab- 
normal appetite the next morning for an excess of energy- 
giving food, or it produces a languid feeling and loss of 
appetite. Such a system of living is responsible for the large 
number of acute and chronic diseases and consumption, while 
those who seemingly keep in good health under such condi- 
tions do surely shorten their life. 

Perfect health and comfort are worth more than earthly 
possessions, and those who strive earnestly to possess and 
retain health will find a way to change their system of living. 
There is strength in union, and if a sufficient number of sensi- 
ble people demanded different hours for school-children and 
for people who work indoors, it would be possible to obtain 
them. 

During hot summer days or in, the tropics the noon hour is 
not always the best for the heaviest meal of the day, but 
neither should it be spent for work. Two meals per day is the 
best plan on hot days. An individual who is always keyed 
up to the highest point during the middle of the day, and ex- 
pends the best of his energy for work, cannot expect anything 
else but bankruptcy. 

For people who desire two meals per day, the best time for 
breakfast is between nine and ten in the morning, and for 
dinner between three and four in the afternoon. 

If three meals are taken, hard muscular workers, or those 
who are employed out of doors, do well to substitute for their 
dinner a substantial cold or warm lunch. If through lack of 
time and convenience a child cannot have its dinner before 
4 p. m., it is better off without it. Remember that a cooked 
dinner consisting of meat, potatoes and vegetables is not at all 
necessary for the child's welfare and development, and cooked

vegetables should never be forced upon it if it prefers to eat 
them raw. Healthy children have keen instinct, and unless 
their appetite has become perverted by sweets and other arti- 
ficial, unnatural foods, they are more likely to select the right 
kind of food than the average adult. 

This book gives a large number of menus, consisting of raw 
foods, which can be quickly prepared when the child comes 
home from school. Nuts, fruits and raw vegetables form an 
ideal diet for the summer. Baked beans, peas and lentils 
warmed over, or jellied fish, egg foods, cheese or steamed pud- 
dings in combination with a warm soup or raw apples form a 
perfect meal during cold, winter days. If the dinner is eaten 
between the hours of 3 130 p. m. and 4 :oo p. m., no more food 
is necessary. If it is served at noon, give milk or soup be- 
tween 5 and 6 p. m. Children should take at least one-half an 
hour's rest before eating, when coming home from school. The 
better way would be to allow children two hours for their noon 
meal or curtail the hours of school work from 9 a. m. to 
i or 2 p. m. Such is the custom in many European countries, 
and there is no reason why it could not be practiced here. 

Children between the ages of eight and fourteen should retire 
between 7 and 8 p. m. If they get sufficient sleep and are 
properly fed, children's diseases need not be feared.

SANDWICHES. 

The sandwich is an important part of the bill of fare. It 
is not necessary to eat a cooked dinner in order to have a 
square meal, but for those who work indoors and are unable 
to take walking exercises before or after their noon meal, it 
is important to take some warm fluid or semi-fluid -food in the 
form of broth, milk or soup as an entree or with their meal. 
With the convenience of modern inventions of gas, alcohol and 
electric stoves, or patented bottles which keep food warm for 
hours, this is easily obtained. 

An endless variety of nutritious lunches can be prepared 
from left-over or fresh vegetables, meats, fish, eggs and cheese, 
or from raw cereals, nuts, fruits and greens. The bread used 
for sandwiches should always be stale or sun dried and be 
kept in a dry place in a tin box with good ventilation.

The harmony and disharmony between the different foods 
as mentioned above are only stated in a general way. Certain 
combinations are absolutely harmful to every individual, others 
are either harmful to certain temperaments, or, to mix them 
would mean a waste in the animal economy of the body. 

REMARKS. 

Use only one rich protein, food at any meal. 

Exceptions : A few nuts which are rich in fat may be eaten 
at the end of a meal where lean meat is served. 

Milk and milk soups may be taken at the beginning of a 
meal where meat is served, but they should never be mixed 
with the meat dish or used at the end of a meal where meat is 
served. 



CHAPTER V. 

LAXATIVE FOODS.

MENUS. 

A menu which is one-sided or combined wrongly, that is, one 
in which either protein, carbohydrates, minerals or fluids are 
provided in excess, leads to waste of nervous energy as well 
as to waste of nutritive material. A wrong combination creates 
fin abnormal appetite for too much or too little food. 

Each person should learn by experience to select the kinds 
of food which yield him nourishment and avoid those which 
disagree.

WHAT SHALL WE DRINK WITH OUR MEALS? 

This question is often asked. It depends entirely on the 
quality and combination of food which is eaten. 

A diet consisting of a variety of solids and vegetables with 
excessive fluids gives the stomach nothing to do ; the contents 
pass at once into the intestines. Such mixtures are ingested 
instead of being digested ; they cannot be fully utilized because 
the stimuli upon the drainage of the body is lacking. 

If dry foods are eaten, such as sandwiches, rice, macaroni, 
potatoes or dry cereals, without the addition of fruits, vege- 
tables or soups, a small amount of liquid should be taken. 
Such simple foods do not form a perfect meal, therefore milk 
or broths are preferable to water. \Vater is best taken from 
five to fifteen minutes before the meal or from one to two hours 
after meals. Black malt coffee is sometimes beneficial if one- 
half cupful is taken after or with meals. It acts like a tonic, 
especially if the liver is sluggish.

cottage cheese, Swiss cheese, fish, lamb chops, meat cakes 
(prepared from left-over cooked meats), eggs, pancakes (pre- 
pared with eggs or cream), fried egg-toast, sausages, legume

190 POOR MAX'S BILL OF FARE. 

If porridge with milk is desired for breakfast, substitute a 
quart of milk in place of apples, oil, lemon and onion. Use one 
and three-fourths cup of rolled wheat or rye in. place of two and 
one-half cups. If sugar is necessary, add fifteen prunes or five 
level tablespoons of sugar. During the summer, substitute 
carrots or cucumbers for the sweets. Raw, sweet or sub-acid 
fruits do not combine well with cooked cereals. Raw fruits 
and raw cereals is a better combination. 

In order to reduce the cost of living to 10 cents per person 
per day or 50 cents per day for all, leave out the fat meat cost- 
ing 15 cents, and some of the butter, replacing it by cooking 
oil. It is easy to modify the diet or add to it in a given direc- 
tion. If more protein is required, a boiled egg or a few nuts 
may be added to the breakfast. If more fuel is needed, it can 
be added in the form of soup, fruits or fat. In comparing the 
value of i pound of legumes with i pound of lean meat and the 
additional fatty and green foods that are necessary with a meat 
diet, the housewife will realize that she must either have a big 
purse for the bills of fare with meat, or starve her family if they 
<!o not like legumes. 

Ten. cents per day is a small sum for a useful citizen to live 
on, yet thousands of people are compelled to do so every year, 
and for these the following pages might be of assistance. 

Economical management, self-denial and abstinence from 
luxuries are the lessons to be studied. Look over the chapter 
on- protein foods carefully. Never economize in these in order 
to buy cake, pastry or sweets. All who, for some reason or 
other, have to fight off starvation, will find that whole wheat 
bread and pure water or oatmeal porridge are the most perfect 
foods to keep them in fair health. They prevent diseases 
which might be the result of such conditions. To keep up on 
tea, coffee, sugar, white bread and liquor might result in dan- 
gerous breakdowns, insanity, murder and suicide. Coffee, tea 
and alcohol are medicines ; they are valuable at times for the 
sick, when the system cannot digest food, or under conditions 
where not sufficient natural food can be obtained. On such 
occasions they may prevent disease and death.

192 BOOKKEEPING. 

Knowledge of bookkeeping is a necessity for systematic 
homekeeping. The experience gained from a household book 
with careful planning for one year is of more value than the 
experience gained from five years of unsystematic housekeep- 
ing. Wise management of a home will enable a family with 
a moderate income to enjoy comforts and pleasures, of which 
a family in better circumstances, but with poor and unwise 
management, is deprived. 

"Time is money." therefore careful planning of the time that 
is expended for work, rest, recreation and outdoor life is as 
important as management of finances. Many women waste 
much valuable time with nonsensical details in the line of clean- 
ing, cooking and fancy sewing. This abnormal amount of 
manual \vork and neglect of mental development is generally 
followed by worry and poor health, as the result of an anemic 
brain. In those conditions mental healers perform miraculous 
c tires either by changing the activity of the mind or by paralyz- 
ing it to the extent of ignoring the plain facts of nature, and by 
denying the testimony of the senses. 

The modern household is full of unwholesome things, too 
many pictures, carpets, curtains and other ornaments, and too 
many salted, peppered, sugared and greasy artificial foods, with 
a lot of unnecessary dishes and utensils. A woman who enjoys 
spending all her time in drudgery, values herself below the 
poorest paid day-laborer. 

To save time and strength means investing time and strength 
on more important subjects, such as harmonious conversations, 
out of door exercise, attending lectures, and the teaching of the 
laws of health and hygiene to the young, which cannot be be- 
gun too early. Unsystematic management of household work 
and the care of children has broken up many a home.

RECIPES FOR MIXED BOILED DINNERS. 

They are much appreciated in many foreign countries by 
people of moderate means. The housekeeper who does her own 
work can save much time by introducing a few of these 
menus at her table. The preparation of foods in. this manner 
requires less water, it is more of a steaming process, and fewer 
dishes and utensils are needed. 

Dishwashing becomes a burden in many a large household 
and the intelligent homekeeper studies economy in all direc- 
tions. 

I ask in advance that you try the recipes ; lay aside prejudice 
against some of the good old-fashioned dishes, to which you are 
not accustomed, and stop wasting your time over new and 
fashionable recipes that ruin your health. Simplicity and 
knowledge are a great help for a low purse. 

I. 

LIMA BEANS WITH CARROTS AND POTATOES. 
Soak one pound of lima beans in rain or soft water over 
night, cook for half an hour, add salt, and then add five good 
sized carrots cut to the size of the beans. Cook both for half 
an hour, then* add four or five potatoes and cook all together 
until done. Thicken the broth with corn starch, add chopped 
parsley and butter. A tablespoon of vinegar and sugar may be 
added to the sauce if the flavor is desired. The carrots may 
be cooked by themselves ; when done, add the water to the 
beans and potatoes, pour a little diluted vinegar over the car- 
rots, let stand 20 minutes, drain off the vinegar and add the 
carrots to the beans and potatoes. This is preferable for people 
who dislike the sweet taste of the carrots. Serve with pork, 
bacon, frankfurters or without meat. Bread is not needed at 
this meal, as potatoes and carrots furnish sufficient carbo- 



MIXED BOILED DINNERS. 215 

hydrates. If bread is desired, it should be eaten in place of 
dessert with a little unsweetened black coffee or malt coffee. 

II. 

Small White or Brown Beans with Carrots and Potatoes. 

Prepare the same as the foregoing. The time -for cooking 
beans depends on the quality. The carrots should not be added 
until the beans are nearly d'one. 

III. 
Dried Green Peas with Carrots and Pork. 

Prepare the same as the foregoing. Young green peas or 
string beans may be used in place of dried ones. The latter 
are excellent during the summer in combination, with salted 
pickled herring or creamed chipped beef. 

IV. 
Green Dried Peas with Dumplings. 

See recipe for bread or flour damplings. Cook the dump- 
lings in salted water and serve with the peas in place of meat 
or prepare a pea soup and boil the dumplings in the soup. This 
makes a perfect meal for dinner. 

Use one-fourth to one-half a cup of dried peas per person, 
according to size and age of the individual. Green fresh peas 
may be substituted in the summer. Fried bacon is a good ad- 
dition. 

Dumplings with Potatoes and Prunes. 
Steam the potatoes. Prepare some nutritious dumplings 
from flour or bread with eggs. Heat some butter, bacon fat or 
oil, add finely chopped onions, fry until brown, remove from 
the fire and add two tablespoons of syrup and some lemon 
juice or vinegar. Pour the potatoes and dumplings on a dish, 
mix with stewed cold or warm prunes, pour the syrup sauce 
over it and serve. Serve with lettuce. The syrup sauce can 
be thickened with flour and strengthened with the water in 
which the dumplings have been cooked; the prune juice can be 
added in place of the syrup. Serve with fried bacon. Good 
during the summer. 



216 MIXED BOILED DINNERS. 

VI. 

Potatoes, Macaroni and Prunes. 

Cook the macaroni until very tender, drain, off the water, 
combine and serve in same manner as the foregoing. 

VII. 

Fried Dumplings. 

Cut left-over dumplings into thin slices, fry in hot fat or 
butter until brown. Flavor with onions if desired. 



MEMORANDUM 



PART FOUR 



CHAPTER I. 

DISEASE. 

Disease is that condition of the body where there is any de- 
parture from the normal, in function, or structure. It may be 
local or general, and may tend to recovery, death or life-long 
suffering. 

Many so-called forms of dyspepsia are brought about by 
improper eating, or by eating when not hungry or when tired. 
In such cases, a regulated life and the right selection, combi- 
nation and preparation of foods is the only means to correct it. 

ULCERATION OF STOMACH AND INTESTINE. 

Causes : After effects from acute diseases, worry, envy, ex- 
cesses of eating or drinking, bony displacements, anemia and 
overwork. The patient should consult a physician at once. 
If certain areas of the glandular structure of stomach or intes- 
tine have been destroyed once, the normal structure cannot 
be restored; but with good care and proper dietetic measures 
great improvement can take place. Excess of starchy foods 
is always harmful. Particles of food not well masticated can 
cause much disturbance. The presence of fats in large amounts 
or wrongly combined with other foods will also retard diges- 
tion ; they cause the pyloric orifice to contract more, and leave 
the food contents in the stomach for a long time, and in this 
way cause fermentation, and putrefaction. 

Dyspepsia and indigestion are the beginnings of a dis- 
ordered metabolism and if neglected the results are: Nervous 
prostration, insanity, consumption,, pelvic disorders, difficult 
child-birth, weak offspring, different forms of tumors and 
cancers and a multitude of fashionable and epidemic diseases. 



DISEASE. 219 

CONSTIPATION. 

The recognized rule is that the bowels should be evacuated 
once per day. Nevertheless, there are a number of people 
whose bowels act only every second or third day, and whose 
health is not impaired thereby. Healthy people who live on 
natural foods, such as raw fruits, nuts and grains, or on simple 
cooked foods with a moderate amount of meat, as a rule wilt 
not find it necessary to resort to artificial means for evacuation 
of the bowels. 

People, whose diet consists mainly of meats, cooked vege- 
tables and potatoes mixed with fermentable substances, or 
those who mix meat with milk and sweets or soft puddings will 
find it absolutely necessary to have a daily evacuation of the 
bowels, in order to retain perfect health. 

CHRONIC CONSTIPATION. 

Different habits of diet have a great effect upon evacuations. 
People who suffer from chronic constipation without any par- 
ticular ailment or disease may often be greatly benefited by 
adding a greater amount of fruits or vegetables to their diet. 
Others find it necessary to discard cooked fruits for a while 
and take oily substances. Some people are constipated from 
insufficient protein elements in- their food. The original cause 
may have been mechanical obstruction. Morbid anatomy 
and morbid physiology go hand in hand. Therefore, if proper 
hygiene and diet does not correct the condition, the patient 
should consult a physician for special treatment. 

MALARIA. 

Malaria is a germ disease, but like many other germ dis- 
eases, the primary cause is lowered resistance, caused by 
poisoned air and adulterated food stuffs. Protection against 
adulterated food stuffs depends upon enforcement of pure- 
food laws, and the training of every housekeeper in the art of 
domestic science. Impure milk, whether poisoned by the 



220 DISEASE. 

milkmen or handled carelessly by the housekeeper, cannot 
be turned into good blood. The same is true of other food 
stuffs. 

Dry, pure air is absolutely necessary for the patient who 
suffers with malaria. Dwelling places near which are stag- 
nant pools, rain barrels, marsh land or stores where decayed 
fruits and vegetables are housed, are dangerous to people who 
are afflicted with malaria or any other germ disease. Mos- 
quitoes are held responsible for both malaria and yellow fever. 
They breed in warm weather, wherever stagnant water is 
found. To prevent a disease that is spread by animal or vege- 
table parasites we must direct our effort against the breeding 
places of these disease carriers. Coal oil, poured upon the 
surface of stagnant water on streets, or near our homes, is a 
great help in preventing the multiplication of mosquitoes. 
Screens on dwelling houses, dry basements, plenty of sunshine 
in the home and the prevention of accumulation of vegetable 
refuse can do much toward protection from these parasites. 

People who are afflicted with partial congestion of the portal 
circulation have stagnant and poisoned blood, and are more 
liable to contract malaria than those whose liver is in good 
working order. Many people are under the impression that 
they have liver trouble if they put more work upon this organ 
than it is able to do. Overtaxing of any part of the body will 
finally result in congestion and disease. 

If mechanical obstructions are responsible for sluggish con- 
ditions of the liver, they should be remedied by anatomical 
and physiological adjustment. Deep breathing is of the great- 
est importance in all diseases affecting the abdominal organs. 
Fresh air at night is as important as during the day. During 
rainy weather have a fire going during the night in order to 
keep the air dry. Protect the body with warmer clothing after 
sunset, and wear light woolen underwear if necessary to avoid 
chills during sleep. 

The diet should be light and nutritious. Avoid all rich con- 
diments, spices, soft puddings containing milk and eggs, yeast 
breads and cakes. Some cases should avoid milk, cheese, shell- 
fish and other foods rich in protein. 



DISEASE. 221 

THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS MAY BE HELP- 
FUL TO INVALIDS WHO SUFFER FROM CHRON- 
IC AFFECTIONS OF THE LIVER AND 
INTESTINAL INDIGESTION. 

1. Spend at least four hours per day out of doors. 

2. Take short walks before and after dinner and before and 
after supper. Take deep breathing exercises by open win- 
dows before breakfast, and exercise the lower limbs while 
in bed,. 

3. Have breakfast at 9 a. m. and supper between 4 and 5 p. m. 

4. Never work or eat when, the hands and feet are cold. 

5. Relax and breathe deeply with face down for 20 minutes, 
three times per day before meals. 

6. During damp or rainy weather rest more, eat more greens, 
citrus fruits and fatty foods, and little or none of those 
foods which are rich in protein, such as cheese, whites of 
eggs, lean meats, nuts, beans, canned corn and milk foods, 
and select protein foods for the noon meal in the form of 
green pea or lentil soup, with or without tomatoes, or fat 
cold pork, fish or bacon in combination with apples, mashed 
beets, carrots or yellow turnips with lemon, hard yolks of 
eggs and fried bacon. Rice with tomato sauce and cold fat 
meat is also good. Black stale bread is best. 

7. For breakfast use fats in the form of mayonnaise dressing 
with raw apples and tomatoes and plenty of onions, also 
fat meat if desired, and corn meal mush with eggs and 
cranberry sauce and celery; or the above mentioned green 
leaf vegetables. Celery roots, raw or cooked, with lemon 
and toasted bread and butter or fried bacon is also good. 
Use raw carrots, cranberries and beets with greens and 
French dressing. Raw cabbage is also good. 

8. For supper select your food according to your appetite. If 
you are warm, active and energetic, take some raw fresh 
milk with zwieback and tomato or cranberry juice, or suck 
the juice of one-half or one-fourth of a lemon or grape- 
fruit with it, white and yellow skin and all, expectorate the 
residue. Bran tea, barley or oatmeal water with one-fourth 



222 DISEASE. 

sterilized cream is good. If you are cold and chilly eat a 
plate of warm soup made of tomatoes or plums, huckle- 
berries, string beans or asparagus (treated with lemon), 
or potato soup, or eat green cooked leaf vegetables with 
lemon and fried bacon, toasted or puffed wheat, and butter. 
9. During the dry, frosty season, when the sun is bright dur- 
ing the middle of the day, eat a moderate amount of those 
foods forbidden under No. 6, combine them rightly, and 
take walks in the sunshine after dinner. 

ic. Mornings and evenings eat about the same foods as sug- 
gested in the foregoing. 

11. Dress the body according to the changes of temperature. 

12. Avoid over-heated rooms, and stay in bed until the sun 
rises, if necessary. 

13. Keep the bowels in good order by enemas. 

14. Black malt coffee prepared with a few whole or crushed 
coffee beans is of medicinal value if taken in small quanti- 
ties after meals, especially after the noon meal ; it acts as 
a tonic to the liver. Law cranberries may be substituted 
if desired. 

The above mentioned suggestions are for extreme cases of 
liver degeneration. They also apply to many chronic, so- 
called incurable diseases where the protein and starches of the 
diet should be limited in quantity to the minimum, compatible 
with the requirements of the individual. 

There are cases of liver trouble where there is no interfer- 
ence with the glycogenic and oxidizing action of the liver, 
and where an. entirely different diet is required. Therefore, no 
patient should attempt to treat a disease by a book, without 
having his case diagnosed by a physician and receiving advice 
as to the special diet required. 



DISEASE. 223 

TUBERCULOSIS. 

It is one of the most fatal diseases that affects men and animals. 
It is due to a germ called the bacillus of tuberculosis. This 
germ, however, is not the primary cause for the development 
of the disease. Wrong environment, unclean air and food are 
the causes that multiply these germs. Hereditary weaknesses 
play an important part, but the disease itself is never inher- 
ited. Lowered vitality, infection through milk and meat, and 
careless spitting are in a large measure responsible. 

Children of parents who suffer from tuberculosis may grow 
up into healthy and strong individuals, if the proper conditions 
are furnished. Tendencies to disease are universally manifest 
in the weaker structures, and this \veaker resisting power is 
the exact measure of the power inherent in heredity. 

Tuberculosis may affect the lungs or manifest itself in dif- 
ferent parts of the body, and is kno\vn under the following 
names : Potts disease or curvature of the spine ; hip joint dis- 
ease, when it affects the hip joint ; white swelling or knee joint 
disease ; ankle joint disease ; lupus or skin disease ; scrofula, 
when it affects the glands of the neck; tuberculous ulceration, 
v, hen it affects the inside of the intestine ; tuberculous peritoni- 
tis, when it affects the outside of the intestine; and consump- 
tion, when the lungs are involved. 

PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS. 
The House We Live In. 

Sunlight is the best known disinfectant. The direct rays 
of the sun destroy tubercular germs and the majority of other 
micro-organisms. Plants cannot grow without sunshine. Hu- 
man beings cannot enjoy health in dark dwelling places, with- 
out sulight. The houses we live in should contain a large 
number of windows and glass doors, so as to permit all rooms 
to be permeated with sunlight. It is a pity that modern 
houses, with all their conveniences and sanitary arrangements, 
have so little provision for proper sterilization by sunlight. 

Many new modern houses are provided with a lot of uri- 



224 DISEASE. 

necessary closet room, pantries and double stairways, halls 
and other accessories, which shut up impure air and prevent 
proper ventilation. Instead of living in large, luxurious 
houses, our health and comfort could be greatly improved by 
the investment of more space in artistically constructed gar- 
dens. Smaller houses, long and narrow in form, or wide and 
short, according to the location and size of the lot, could be 
daily disinfected and sterilized from cellar to attic by the 
rays of the glorious sun. A building of this kind may consist 
of two, four, eight, ten or more rooms, with one or three 
floors, and can offer comfort for one family, or be divided 
into apartments or flats. A house should be built on porous 
ground. 

A lower floor, with parlor and spare bedrooms, is more easily 
ventilated and kept clean than a high basement with poor 
flooring, and no provision for proper airing or the admission 
of sunlight. 

The mother of a family who has to do her own work in a 
two-story house could save much time and strength by having 
her kitchen and dining room on the upper floor, with hall and 
stairway and glass door in the center of the house, which 
would enable her to attend to the door from above. A house 
so constructed could easily be provided with porches for sleep- 
ing, and a place for the children to play during the morning 
hours, and in this way relieve the mother of many unnecessary 
steps. 

Large, beautiful gardens call for work which is mixed with 
brains, while large houses with fashionable accessories call 
for slavery and compel one woman to become the servant of 
another woman. 

All human beings are born with a pair of arms, which by 
gradual development enable them to care for their bodies in 
matters of feeding, dressing, hygiene and comforts. Assistants 
in the home are required for the child, the sick and the help- 
less. 

Modern inventions relieve us partly of house-cleaning and 
laundry work, and modern methods of simple feeding and 
luxurious airing will relieve us from solving the servant prob- 
lem and prevent diseases that are created by wrong living. 



DISEASE. 225 

TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS. 

Clinical experience with hygiene and diet have proved that 
they are the most important factors in the treatment of dis- 
ease. 

A certain class of patients who are in the early stages of this 
disease may be benefited by a liberal diet, but the larger percent- 
age of sufferers really have indigestion and can only gain bene- 
fit by cutting down their diet and by living upon plain, non- 
stimulating food. The amount of carbo-hydrate foods should 
be decreased and the amount of fats increased. Olive oil in 
combination with raw vegetables, acid fruits and raw eggs 
and fat meats should be given daily. They are best taken for 
breakfast. The heavier protein foods should be eaten at the 
noon meal in combination with a small amount of cereals and 
raw greens. The evening meal should consist of broths with 
egg, cooked green vegetables, toast and bacon, or of milk 
foods. If extra milk is required it should be given with a 
keen appetite. Food eaten without relish cannot be properly 
oxidized and assimilated. 

People who are compelled to work while sick should take 
seme extra milk between 10 and 12 a. m. and during the after- 
noon. Milk may be taken raw or boiled, according to the in- 
dividual requirements. The bowels should be kept in order 
by enemas and laxative foods. 

RICKETS. 

This is a condition where there is interference with the 
nutrition of the bones. The bones, like other parts of the 
body, are injured by lack of nourishment; they become soft 
and yielding like wax, and are drawn by the muscles into de- 
formity. The animal matter which enters into the composition 
of the'skeleton is in great excess, and the earthy (or mineral 
matter) is deficient in proportion. Causes for such conditions 
are: Lack of lime and minerals in. the food, before or after 
birth; impure or inferior milk; fermenting foods; excess of 
starchy foods, sweets and meats ; insufficient greens, legumes 
and nut-foods in the mother's food, and overwork of the mother 
before or after birth of the child ; damp and impure air and un- 



226 DISEASE. 

healthy dwellings. The first symptoms of this disease or a 
tendency to it can sometimes be detected in a child during the 
first year by soft and flabby muscles, excess of fat, difficulty 
and backwardness of learning to walk, and in cutting teeth, 
extremely narrow chest, continual digestive disturbances with 
constipation, or greenish looking evacuations, and catarrh of 
the bowels. Softening of the bones of the head is often pres- 
ent. 

The prevention and treatment of this disease demands care- 
ful regulation of the diet, sufficient sleep, pure air, dry, sunny 
dwellings, warm baths, massage and salt rubs. If the child 
perspires much on the upper part of the body during sleep, 
avoid feather pillows and keep the lower limbs warm by arti- 
ficial heat if necessary. Avoid pressure on the head by placing 
a narrow pillow about two inches in width under the neck, and 
no pillow under the head. Keep the child in the lying position 
as much as possible. Do not carry it on the arm except when 
necessary, and never force it to stand or walk against its own 
will. 

The diet should consist of milk and cream with well cooked 
blrained pearl barley and steel cut oats or bran, a moderate 
amount of toast, calf's-foot jelly, eggs strained legumes and 
fat meats. Raw greens, fruits and nuts should be given, as 
soon as the child is able to digest them without difficulty. Al- 
ways select the food in the right combination and never allow 
excesses of any kind. The bowels must be kept regular by 
enemas. 

OBESITY. 

Obesity is a constitutional disease, due to excess of food in 
general or to excess of wrong food and interference with the 
nerve supply controlling the oxidation processes. 

Thousands of people who suffer from this "fat habit" could 
cure themselves by proper attention to hygiene and diet. A 
normal individual who lives right, thinks right and is engaged 
in useful work, does not need to carry useless fat around with 
him. 

Do not take the advice of a friend who promises relief with 
dangerous drugs and salves, or excessive steam-baths and 



DISEASE. 227 

violent exercises. A diet suitable in quality and quantity to 
the particular constitution, useful activity, alternated with 
sufficient rest and recreation, and plenty of sunlight and dry, 
fresh air, are the only means to bring permanent results. A 
change of occupation is necessary at times. The dry diet, con- 
sisting of the necessary amount of proteins, with a large 
amount of raw greens or fruits and fats, and abstinence from 
tea and coffee and foods which are rich in starch and sugar, 
will bring relief to the majority of people who have a tendency 
tc grow stout. 

There are special conditions which require special treat- 
ment, such as tonic baths, massage, sun-baths, osteopathic 
tieatments and special prescribed diets and exercises which 
cannot be discussed here. 



CHAPTER II. 
CARE AND FEEDING OF CONVALESCENTS. 

Convalescence depends much upon the proper food. Fevers 
require that the patient's strength should be kept up. If the 
body has been overfed on certain articles, these must be 
stopped, and those elements which are needed must be admin- 
istered in the form of food, water, air and so on. The fever 
is nature's method of throwing off disease, and if properly 
guided it does not become dangerous. A physician should be 
sent for at once. The diet prescribed for the patient and the 
directions in regard to quantity, temperature and time of ad- 
ministration should be carried out in every detail, just like 
other' directions in regard to nursing. Many a patient has 
been, seriously injured or even killed through the administra- 
tion of foods which were forbidden by the doctor. At times 
there is a special desire for a particular kind of food. It may 
be an indication that the system requires it, and such craving 
should always be reported to the doctor, and if possible the 
physician will suggest such a food or some substitute which 
will answer the purpose. 

The temperature of the food should be tested before serving. 
Blood warm is generally the best. The tray should not be 
loaded with a variety of foods. The patient should not be 
tempted with food unless forced feeding is indicated. 

If the tongue is coated, give a little water with lemon juice 
before breakfast, especially if milk foods are to be eaten. If 
the appetite is not keen, do not take milk foods for breakfast. 

VOMITING. 

If vomiting occurs or is continued for any length of time, 
it may be checked by giving cold weak tea or black coffee at 
frequent intervals, or a few drops of brandy in a tablespoonful 
of ice water. In many cases it is better for the patient to have 
his breakfast in bed for some time after recovery, especially 
if the exertion of dressing is tiresome or the temperature of the 



DIET FOR THE SICK. 229 

room is unsuited to the patient's condition. A mild warm 
room is preferable to an overheated one. 

DIET. 

Diet for the sick may be classified as liquid, semi-liquid and 
solid foods. A liquid diet is generally given only during acute 
illness or after operations. The kind of food, as well as the 
amount and intervals at which it should be given, are usually 
prescribed by the attending physician. Therefore, only a few 
suggestions are given. 

If nourishment by enema is necessary, predigested sub- 
stances are the best ; peptonized milk and malt extracts or well 
prepared, strained gruels of bran and oats, or of bran alone, to 
\vhich one to two teaspoonsful of brandy have been added. 
Black sereal coffee or weak black coffee are often excellent 
where stimulation is desired. The amount should be from one 
to three ounces at a time, and the temperature should be luke 
warm. It must be injected very slowly. 

If the patient is of a nervous temperament, or suffers from 
irritability of the stomach, he should have as little animal food 
as possible, especially for breakfast. As a rule a well prepared 
water gruel satisfies the demands of the body until the noon 
hour. It acts as a sedative and rests the whole body, and in 
this way more nervous energy can be expended for digestion 
at the noon meal. 

There are some exceptions ; for example, if a patient has 
had a restless night and is exhausted, he may have a cupful of 
freshly prepared whey or bran-tea with milk or cream before 
his breakfast. As a rule such conditions should not appear 
during convalescence, and may be prevented by intelligent 
nursing and avoidance of unnecessary company. 

The greatest care should be taken not to allow a patient to 
eat rapidly or to take large quantities at one time, and also 
to avoid foods which produce fermentation.

MEMORANDUM 



APPENDIX. 

MENTAL HYGIENE AND DIET. 

Proper growth and activity of the brain and nervous system 
are promoted by a healthy flow of blood. Pure air and suffi- 
cient protein food properly combined and proportioned with 
carbo-hydrate and fatty foods, rich in prosphates and minerals, 
are essential. Choose more of the lighter form of protein and 
starchy foods, as fish, eggs, almonds, green peas, bacon, a mod- 
erate amount of lamb and beef, rice, sago, wheat, and vege- 
table gelatines. Foods rich in minerals are celery, apples, 
tomatoes, greens, oranges, and practically all the fresh fruits 
and vegetables, especially the small berries. Melons and 
starchy vegetables in large quantities are suitable for muscular 
workers. Use as little as possible of so-called pure chemical 
substances, such as refined sugar and flour. 

Avoid poisonous beverages, tobacco and all forms of drugs. 
Sleep at least nine hours in a well ventilated room, facing east 
or south. Avoid constipation. Combine mental work with 
moderate amounts of useful and enjoyable exercise, or physical 
work. Protect the eyes from strong artificial light. Keep the 
feet warm. Relax before and after meals. A certain amount 
of manual labor is absolutely necessary for the brain-worker. 
It favors deep breathing and creates a demand for more air 
and water, and thus improves digestion, oxidation and nutri- 
tion. The body poisons are carried off quicker and nervous 
headaches and despondency are avoided. Short walks out of 
doors before retiring are very beneficial for people who suffer 
with cold hands and feet. 

"THE IMMIGRANT." 

All who leave the land of their birth should make themselves 
acquainted with the art of living and the peculiarities of the 
new country in which they intend to live. 



246 THE IMMIGRANT. 

To depart entirely from their old customs and habits is as 
dangerous as to neglect the study of the new environment or 
the failure to adopt necessary changes. 

In some States the climatic conditions of the United States 
are very changeable; we have extreme heat and cold, and 
excess of rain with wind storms and dryn-ess changing within 
a short time. West of the Rocky Mountains we have a mild 
sea air. In the Southern States and near the Pacific Coast we 
have low districts where malaria and catarrhal conditions are 
easily acquired. 

Tropical fruits and vegetables which are looked upon as lux- 
uries in Northern Europe are necessary articles of food in the 
country where they grow, therefore the stranger should make 
himself acquainted with such foods and' by degrees learn to 
eat them. 

In countries where the days are extremely hot and the 
nights are cold, the selection of foods should be made accord- 
ingly. Fats produce more than twice the amount of energy 
than carbo-hydrates, therefore they are more suitable during 
the early part of the day. During the middle of the day 
select foods of the protein class, in proper proportion with 
fruits and raw greens. For the evening meal use the stimu- 
lating sub-acid and sweet fruits in combination with light 
protein and cereal foods. 



HEALTH HINTS FOR BUSY PEOPLE. 

1. Keep the feet warm, the head cool and the stomach not 
too full. 

2. Take walks out of doors daily and breathe deeply. 

3. Do not wear tight shoes or tight corsets. 

4. Masticate your food thoroughly. Select, combine and 
prepare it rightly. Do not overeat. 

5. Avoid fresh breads, inferior cakes and pastry. 

6. Do not eat unless you are hungry. 

7. Do not over-indulge in athletic or any other kind of ex- 
ercise. 

8. Remember that natural feeding, pure air and sufficient 
sleep call for natural breathing and natural exercise. 

9. Unnatural feeding and late hours create disease or ner- 
vousness. 

10. Don't take drugs for sleeplessness. 

11. Tired feeling in the morning is the result of nerve 
starvation and auto-intoxication. 

12. The house we live in should be constructed for health 
and comfort, rather than for style. 

13. Sleep by open windows. Night air is as pure as day air. 
Protect yourself from dampness by an open fire if necessary. 

14. Do not dress and wash in a cold bath room. Have your 
wash bowl in. the bed room. 

15. Sewer gas from a small pipe in a well ventilated bed 
room is not harmful, as it is carried off in the air. Have the 
stopper placed in the hole when not in use. 

16. Dress by an open fire or in a sunny room. A chill 
before breakfast produces indigestion and a desire for unnec- 
essary hot foods. 

17. Never sleep by night lamps or any other artificial light. 
They are injurious to the eyes and absorb oxygen. 

1 8. Teach a growing child that 'selecting and preparing his 
food is an important occupation. 

19. Do not allow a child to fill his body with trash. 

20. Pure water is as important as pure food. If you boil 
your water the minerals are deposited on the bottom of the 
kettle instead of in the system for bone-making material. 



248 HEALTH HINTS. 

21. Milk is a food, not a drink; it should never be taken in 
addition to, or at the end of, a heavy meal. 

22. Many people object to boiled milk on account of a 
theory that it tends to constipate. Do not dwell on theories ; 
find out the effect for yourself. Potatoes, toast and many other 
cooked foods are constipating also. Why not object to those? 

23. Raw foods are more nutritious than cooked foods, if 
they are pure and fresh and can be digested without difficulty. 

24. A change from cooked to raw foods might produce 
diarrhoea or constipation. The latter condition is generally 
not dangerous. Constipation from cooked foods is more dan- 
gerous. 

25. A daily evacuation oi" the bowels is not always a sign 
that the stomach and -intestines are in good working order. 
The bowels can be forced to move by the eating of too rich 
foods. 

26. Some people are clearer in mind on a vegetarian diet, 
while upon others it has no such effect at all. 

27. A healthy individual does not need to confine himself 
to a special system of diet. Avoid dangerous experiments car- 
n'ed on- for orthodox reasons. 

28. Rich soaky cooked nut foods are not health -foods. Jf 
you want to be a vegetarian, live on raw foods. 

29. Some people thrive on raw foods while others do not. 
The best time to begin with raw foods is in childhood. 

30. Hot house plants cannot digest raw foods. Open, your 
doors and windows and learn to breathe first. Fresh air and 
sunshine are necessary for the change of food. 

31. If your teeth are poor, substitute a food-chopper or 
grinder for your foods. 

32. The most perfect foods, such as apples, tomatoes, wheat, 
oats, rye, legumes and nuts seldom disagree with a healthy 
individual, provided they are used wisely. 

33. Sunlight is a great disinfectant. Dark rooms are a 
breeding place for tuberculous germs. 

34. Daily out-of-door exercise in the sunshine will increase 
health and reduce the coal bill. Without exercise our food 
can be of little benefit to us. 



HEALTH HINTS. 249 

35. By natural feeding, overwork is not possible. The body 
demands rest when its strength is exhausted. 

36. Artificial stimulants are deceivers. They make a man 
feel strong when he is weak. They produce artificial heat and 
will-power and an abnormal temperature; they lead to over- 
work, abnormal development and degenerate brains and bodies. 

37. Natural will-power can direct its force wherever it is 
wanted, be it for work or rest; it can sustain on bread and 
water for many days. 

38. Without substance there can be no power. Substantial 
food, fresh air, water and natural exercise develop strong 
bodies and minds. 

39. Artificial sweets, white bread and poisonous beverages 
develop butterflies that crave excitement and artificial life. 

40. The world is full of people that are without substance, 
power or principle. They earn their living the easiest way they 
can. Wrong feeding is responsible for such conditions. 

41. Social reformers and humanitarians cannot splve prob- 
lems until they have learned how to feed the race. 

42. Many people are under the impression that if a certain 
food is recommended as especially healthful, over-indulgence 
must be beneficial. 

43. All natural foods are wholesome ; over-eating produces 
discomfort and disease. 

44. Some fruits and vegetables have high medicinal values. 
Specific foods prescribed in large quantities are useful for cer- 
tain ailments, but not for a healthy individual. 

45. Each individual is a law unto himself. Two different 
people afflicted with a disease of the same name may require 
entirely different treatment. Human beings cannot be stan- 
dardized like inert machines. 

46. Canned fruits out of season are not a necessary article 
of food ; they are of value as a medicine. 

47. If certain foods do not agree, or produce indigestion, 
study their combination and preparation carefully, also the 
proportion, and time of the day when most suitable. If this 
does not prove satisfactory, leave them alone. 

48. Don't buy cheap or inferior food of any kind. 



250 HEALTH HINTS. 

49. Don't always believe your dealer as to the quality of 
the product. Investigate for yourself. 

50. Don't use fruits in excess if you lead a very active life. 
The right-proportion is the key note to main-tain balance. 

51. Excessive fruits and rest is a prescription for sickness. 

52. If no great hunger is felt at a meal, do not eat nuts or 
any kind of foods classed as protein. Neither stuff yourself 
\vith liquid foods. A fast or fruits or fruit juices are the best 
under such conditions. 

53. Do not offer a guest more food than he desires. It may 
be polite, but it is an unwholesome fashion. 

54. Drink sufficient pure natural water between your 
meals. There is danger in over-drinking as well as in under- 
drinking. 

55. A definite employment, practical and loving sympathy 
with our fellow men and faith in the almighty power of crea- 
tion is a good prescription for imaginary diseases. 

56. There is a great medicmal force in a mind of peace. If 
you suffer from chronic ailments brought on by overwork, 
seek rest and solitude, and exercise your soul. The latent 
powers within you can be awakened by right study. Give up 
wrong thoughts and habits. 

57. Hard arteries are the result of high-pressure life. 

58. Restlessness and sleeplessness are the result of an acid 
or toxic condition of the blood. 

59. The liver is the great filter and germ destroyer of the 
body. Co-operate with nature and treat your liver right. 
Germs are not attracted to healthy people. 

60. Many lung diseases are often the result of an abused 
liver. 

61. Mouth-breathing is the result of structural and function- 
al derangement. 

62. Children that are allowed to sit with cold feet in the 
school room cannot keep their health or study their lessons. 

63. A destructive or mischievous child can be corrected by 
proper food and sufficient suitable employments. 

64. Defective teeth and eyesight are often the result of 
improper feeding. Glasses cannot make up the deficiency. 



HEALTH HINTS. 251 

65. Cleanse the mouth and teeth on arising and after each, 
meal. 

66. If you wish to prevent colds, stop overloading your 
stomach. 



HYGIENE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 

The pantry shelf with its contents is responsible for many 
acute diseases and ptomaine poisoning by unhygienic and care- 
less handling and preservation of foodstuffs. 

A closet for the preservation of food should be located on 
the north or east side of the house if possible. It should 
have several long and narrow windows from top to bottom, 
so as to allow plenty of air and light. The shelves should be 
constructed of wire, zinc or wooden slats, and be removable. 

Raw fruits and vegetables should never be kept in the same 
closet with cooked food. Milk and butter should not be kept 
near meat or other cooked foods. Potatoes, carrots and under- 
ground vegetables should be kept out of doors or in a dry 
basement. They may be preserved in a box with dry sand. 

Onions should not be left in. a paper bag; hang them up in 
the sun or keep them in a flat box in a dry place. Onions 
which have been cut should never be used again for food, 
unless the cut side has been preserved in vinegar or oil. 

All raw foods which have a thick skin have better keeping 
qualities than those with a thin skin; therefore, fancy summer 
fruits should be eaten while fresh on the same day they were 
picked. No more should be bought than can be eaten the 
same day, or else they should be preserved by sterilization.. 

Green vegetables should be used fresh if possible, and not 
kept longer than three or four days.- Never keep them in 
the house or pantry. 

Apples or other winter fruits should be kept in a dry store 
room out of doors, in the attic or in a dry basement. 

The white film that often, gathers around grapes is a breed- 
ing place for diphtheria germs. Wash thoroughly before eat- 
ing all fruits which have been stored in houses or at the 
market. Do not prepare more raw food than can be eaten 
at one meal. Never allow it to stand after it is cut. 



252 HYGIENE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 

Many housekeepers think it important to scald their dishes, 
but do not know that it is far more important to sterilize or 
reboil cooked foods which have stood on the shelf for 18 or 24 
hours and sometimes longer. Such foodstuff is dangerous 
long before the process of fermentation can. be detected by the 
sense of smell or taste. 

Some foods begin to undergo changes immediately after 
cooling; therefore, cooked foods left over, with the exception 
of a few, should be reboiled before serving again. Rice or 
other cereals should be stirred over the fire for a while and then 
baked in the oven until they are thoroughly sterile. The 
care of milk has been discvissed in the chapter on food. Soups 
which are preserved with fat will keep wholesome for several 
days without reboiling. Fruits and fruit juices should not 
stand longer than 24 hours. Eggs are best preserved in bran 
or lime-water or on ice if kept for a week or longer. Boiled 
or thoroughly roasted meats will keep wholesome for 36 
hours in a cold place. During the summer meat should not be 
kept from one day to another. 

If left-over meat is cut from the bone and cooked up in 
gravy or soup stock or preserved in gelatine (with fat to cover 
it), it can be kept wholesome for 4 or 5 days and longer, ac- 
cording to the manner of preservation. Half cooked chops 
and beefsteak should never be kept in the same manner they 
are served. They should be cooked thoroughly in fat or gravy 
before being put away. All meats should be freshly cut 
and cooked the same clay after delivery, or be preserved by 
partly cooking or roasting, until the next day. Many house- 
keepers keep roasts, chops and beefsteak until it looks blue 
and green with putrefaction before it is cooked. Never buy 
meat which has an unnatural color. Be sure that your butcher 
does not use poisonous substances to keep the meat from de- 
composition. Visit your butcher often and investigate how 
often he gets a fresh supply of meat. This is of more benefit 
than to save time by telephoning. 

Never allow sliced bacon to lie in the ice box or pantry 
for several days. It becomes rancid and is unfit for food. Buy 
your bacon in bulk and slice it with a sharp knife when wanted. 



HYGIENE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 253 

Do not keep sliced meat of any kind longer than one day in 
cold weather. Do not keep it in hot weather without pre- 
serving it in gravy or fat or by sterilization. 

Do not keep a tight cover on a dish, jar or bottle which con- 
tains raw or cooked food, unless the air within is sterile. 

Allow cooked food to stand open until it is cool, then put 
the cover over two-thirds of its opening or cover with a cheese- 
cloth or a colander. 

If milk or cream is delivered in bottles, remove the cover 
immediately after delivery. If the air where it stands is dusty, 
protect the milk with cotton or cheese-cloth. Treat boiled 
milk in the same manner. 

Cooked foods which have poor keeping qualities should not 
be kept for further use, or no more should be prepared than 
can be eaten at one meal. To this class belong cooked under- 
ground or leaf vegetables, custards, soft puddings, milk and 
egg foods and gelatines. Damp or rainy weather is more 
favorable for decomposition of foodstuffs than dry weather. 

Whites of eggs should not be kept longer than 18 or 24 
hours. They must be preserved in- a very cold place and be 
utilized at the earliest opportunity. They are like all proteins, 
more dangerous than starches if left to ferment, whether the 
fermentation begins on the pantry shelf or in the stomach. 
\Yhite of egg can be used in many different ways. It may be 
beaten to a froth and served on fruit-soups or fruit pies, or it 
can be taken in place of broth at the beginning of a meal. 
Add a tablespoon of water and a few drops of lemon or orange 
or apple or cranberry juice to one white of an egg and beat up 
with a fork, or drink without beating. White of egg can also 
be utilized for brancakes. 

If a variety of left-over food is on hand which cannot be 
combined into one dish, it is better to serve different food to 
each member rather than to divide each article for all; the 
latter custom may be more polite, but it is not wise to mix a 
great variety of foods at one meal. 

Left-over skim-milk is best utilized for cheese, pancakes, 
whey gruel, whey or milk sauce, or be boiled and served with 
stale rye or corn bread. Vegetables prepared with milk do 
not make a good combination. Soft puddings prepared with 



254 HYGIENE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 

skim-milk, sugar and eggs, are not very wholesome unless 
the necessary amount of fat is added in the form of butter or 
suet. Skim-milk and fruit is not a good combination. 

Left-over potatoes can be utilized in many different ways : 
tor fish-cakes, pancakes, hash, potato-dumplings, creamed pota- 
toes or for salad. Fried cooked potatoes are not "a v good food 
for the noon meal, especially for children or people doing active 
work. 

Baked legumes if preserved with fat meat or oil can be kept 
on hand for a week and be rebaked two or three times per 
week. 

PRESERVATION OF EGGS FOR THE WINTER. 

Put one layer of common salt or bran one inch deep on the 
bottom of a wooden pail or washtub. Then grease the eggs 
with parafine or oil and place them with the small end down, 
so that they will not touch the bottom of the tub. Fill with 
enough salt to cover the eggs one inch. 

PRESERVATION OF EGGS. No. 2. 

Preserve the eggs with salicylic acid, w r hich can be bought 
in the drug store. Follow directions on package. 

CHILDREN. 

A child should have his face and hands washed before and 
after each meal. He should not be allowed to carry foodstuffs 
and candy about the house, or touch carpets and furniture 
with sticky and greasy fingers. If he requires food between, 
meals, give him four or five meals per day, but have him eat 
his food in the proper place. 

The breeding of flies, mosquitoes and other disease carriers 
is greatly favored by allowing children to eat at any and all 
times without napkins or special preservation of their dress or 
without cleaning their hands before and after eating or before 
and after playing with animals and pets. 

The American child is given too much consideration at the 
table. There is a great difference between the saying "I don't 
like a certain food" and "I don't want it," because there are 
things which taste better. 



HYGIENE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 255 

To leave one's plate half full of foodstuffs and ask for or 
accept another food is fashionable, but before the law of our 
Creator it is unclean and disrespectful. 

The physiological laws of our bodies are based on. very 
economical plans ; nature utilizes everything and wastes noth- 
ing. Cooked foodstuffs, whether they are wasted within our 
bodies by over-indulgence, or in the garbage can, create de- 
composition, and germs. 

Cooked green foods and mushes are neither wholesome foods 
for chickens or pet animals. Natural food is dry, and animals 
which are fed on dry food produce a better quality of milk, 
eggs and flesh than animals which are fed upon slops. 

DISHWASHING. 

Dishwashing is a work which takes up so much time in 
every household, that it is a subject which should receive some 
attention. 

The housekeeper who serves a considerable amount of raw 
food saves much time and strength by relieving herself of 
greasy dishes and saucepans. 

Scrape off the fragments from plates and utensils and pre- 
pare one basin with hot soapsuds and another with rinsing 
water of clear hot or cold water. People whose time is valua- . 
ble can save much work by placing the dishes from the drain- 
board upside down on a shelf prepared from wooden slats, or 
set them in a wire basket and let them dry without wiping. 

If the dishes are not washed immediately after each meal, 
place the silverware and knives in a high bowl or quart meas- 
ure and let them soak in hot or cold water. Remove all foods 
from metallic utensils immediately after the meal is over. 
Never allow metallic spoons to stand in fruit sauce, salt or 
in any kind of prepared food. Acids dissolve metal and in this 
way may produce poisoning. 

In contagious diseases all dishes should be sterilized. Burn 
up all particles of left-over food, put the dishes into a narrow 
pail and boil with plenty of water and soda for an hour or 
longer. 



256 HYGIEXE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 

DISINFECTION OF EXCRETA. 

Use solutions of carbolic acid or chloride of lime. Mix with 
equal quantities of the excreta and allow it to stand for several 
hours before it is disposed of. 

WHITEWASH FOR WOODWORK. 

Soak one-fourth of a pound of glue in cold water over n.ight. 
Dissolve some lime with cold water, add a few handsful of salt. 
Heat the glue until it is dissolved and add to one bucket of 
whitewash. This makes a smooth and healthy paint. Use 
for rough or smooth woodwork, twice per year in laundry, 
basement or cellar or pan.try.

a Plain confectionery not containing nuts, fruit, or chocolate. 

b Such vegetables as potatoes, squash, beets, etc., have a certain amount of inedible 
material, skin, seeds, etc. The amount varies with the method of preparing the vegetables, 
and cannot be accurately estimated. The figures given for refuse of vegetables, fruits, 
etc., are assumed to represent approximately the amtount of refuse in these foods as 
ordinarily prepared. 

C Fruits contain a certain proportion of inedible materials, as skins, seeds, etc., which 
are properly classed as refuse. In some fruits, as oranges and prunes, the amount re- 
jected in eating is practically the same as refuse. In others, as apples and pears, more or 
less of the edible material is ordinarily rejected with the skin and seeds and other inedible 
portions. The edible material which is thus thrown away, and should properly be classed 
with the waste, is here classed with the refuse. The figures for refuse here given repre- 
sent, as nearly as can be ascertained, the quantities ordinarily rejected.

enter into the infusion. The average in the table represents the available nutrients in the 
beverage. Infusions of genuine coffee and of tea like the above contain practically no 
nutrients.

INTRODUCTION 



HIS is a practical and hygienic cook book for all 
who consider life and health valuable. Intelligent 
homekeepers, nurses, managers of institutions and 
factories, all who are interested in furnishing the 
most nutritious food at the least cost, or wish to 
distribute such a work, will find this book worth its weight in 
gold. 

After twenty years of persistent study, combined with prac- 
cal work as nurse and physician in private and in institutions, 
beginning in Germany, I am able to-day to present this val- 
uable work, and hope that it may be placed in the hands of 
every home-maker in the country. It is designed for the pur- 
pose of modifying the cost of living and of eliminating, to 
some degree, the hardships and drudgeries of our women. It 
is excellent for school feeding, and presents the keynote to 
health and longevity, helping to prevent mental, physical, and 
moral diseases. 

The great facilities for research work in the modern labora- 
tory offer a wide field for the study of preventive medicine and 
hygiene. The world is beginning to recognize the fact that a 
large number of diseases are the result of wrong conditions, 
improper eating, drinking, sleeping, unsuitable work, excess 
of amusement, and wrong educational systems are to blame 
for a large number of germ diseases and chronic ar'lments. 

The body is the temple of the soul, therefore the laws of 
hygiene (concerning our internal and external body) are 
divine. Many of the orthodox teachings and divine laws in 
reference to hygiene, fasting, and feeding are a safe guide for 
the prevention of cl : sease. 

It has been my object to present a practical and sane method 
of living, free from fads and the teachings of one-sided extrem- 
ists. All natural foods are wholesome, if properly combined, 
prepared, proportioned, and selected with care to agree with 
the temperament, environment, age and climatic conditions. I

have devoted a special chapter to economical menus for people 
of moderate means, and have endeavored to show how it is 
possible to feed a family of five on a moderate sum, without 
injury to health. The amount of food and the proportions 
agree with what is demanded by modern standard dietaries. 

A large number of cook books have been written during the 
last one hundred years to tickle the palate. Much valuable 
time has been wasted and many innocent victims have paid 
the price for the sins of gluttony, caused by modern methods 
cf living. 

The most learned and advanced thinkers are turning their 
attention more and more to scientific dietetics. The question 
of feeding is one of the most important subjects our present 
generation has to deal with. It is my desire that this book 
may contribute to this cause, and that it may awaken thousands 
of mothers and daughters to appreciation of the dignity and 
importance of their life work. 



PREFACE 



The human body is a wonderfully complex and mysterious 
establishment, presided over by life. It is composed of the 
dust of the earth, organized by creative power. 

The elements composing the human body are : Oxygen, 
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, chlorine, sulphur, phosphorus, 
fluorine, calcium, natrium, magnesium, silicon, iron and potas- 
sium. 

Our bodies are maintained by food, air, light, activity, rest 
and sleep. 

The union of oxygen with one or more of these elements is 
called oxidation. If the process of oxidation within our bodies 
goes on rapidly we feel warm and energetic ; if it goes on 
slowly, the degree of heat and energy is less ; in fever there is 
rapid oxidation ; in people who suffer with chronic diseases 
there is incomplete and slow oxidation. 

In order to produce harmony between the elements in the 
body, it is not only necessary to breathe pure air, and eat 
wholesome foods, but it is equally important to have those 
food elements, which are taken into our body, selected in the 
r'ght quantity, quality and combination. It is further neces- 
sary to have them prepared in the mouth by mastication and 
insalivation. If this is done, the chemical affinity or combining 
power of the foods is satisfied, and digestion, absorption, san- 
guification, circulation, oxidation, assimilation, excretion and 
Glorification will go on perfectly. 

In order to keep our bodies in perfect health, we must 
understand their laws. The structures and functions of the body 
are intimately connected, and one is dependent upon the other. 

Life at the beginning is a tiny cell; as it multiplies into 
other cells, it forms blood vessels, nerves, muscles, bones, 
lungs, liver, brain, heart, and stomach, until the body is com- 
pleted. The growth of the body is from within, before and 
after birth. The natural food for the infant is mother's milk, 
the next best is the milk of a wet-nurse, whose child is about 



io PREFACE 

the same age as the one to be nursed. Artificial preparations 
of milk from a cow, goat or donkey is the next best. 

The appearance of the teeth indicates that the feeding of 
solid food can- be begun. The kind of food required for the 
child as well as for the adult differs with different individuals. 
A normal and healthy mother will be directed by her instincts, 
reason and judgment to choose the right food for herself as 
well as ior her infant. 

An old saying goes, "God created foods, the devil created 
the cooks." A few thousand years ago, when the art of 
cooking was in its infancy, physicians and surgeons were not 
in such demand as to-day. The preparation of foods for the 
average household in those days consisted mainly of boiled 
cereals prepared with salt and water, boiled and roasted meats, 
and baked breads. Such articles, if eaten in proper combina- 
tion with raw fruits, greens, and nuts, will keep the appetite 
at the normal state. The principal victims of disease in those 
days were the kings, the idle rich and the very poor. Since 
civilization has progressed, and the rights of man are more 
equalized, the whole race is in danger of degeneration through 
the invention of fashionable and artificially prepared foods. 

In this age of refinement, our teeth, which were made to 
last as long as our bodies, begin to decay before we are ma- 
tured. Foods are ingested into our bodies instead of being 
digested. Public hygienists and technical bacteriologists work 
hard, trying to prevent such diseases as diphtheria, scarlet 
fever, tuberculos : s, typhoid fever, and many other infectious 
and epidemic diseases, resulting from unclean food and water, 
and imperfect sewage systems. 

Even with the purest of milk, meat, and water, we can make 
a filthy garbage can of our intestinal tract by the ingestion of 
foods which do not harmonize chemically, the result being 
decomposition. R ; ght here we have all the dangers of modern 
diseases and pus formation, resulting in appendicitis, phlebitis, 
ovaritis, cancer, Bright's disease, and all the above mentioned 
diseases, without having to look further for the garbage can 
on the back porch or the sewage system in the yard. The 
waste products from our tables, and the excretions from our 
bodies would be less dangerous to health if the selection, com- 



PREFACE n 

bination, and preparation of our food were more natural. The 
excretions of properly fed animals are not so dangerous to our 
health; why should ours be? 

The hygienic rules as taught by the orthodox Jew in refer- 
ence to the combination and preparation of foods are wise. 
He is not allowed to mix milk and meat, meat and fish, 
and many other articles of food which do not combine well 
chemically. The Jewish methods of killing animals and the 
preliminary preparations such as the watering and salting of 
meats before cooking are also more hygienic. They eliminate 
part of the toxins of the meat, which have been in close con- 
tact with the air. 

Since life and personal health are generally in charge of 
woman, the right place for every girl under eighteen or twenty 
years is at home or in. school. No young girl under this age 
should be allowed to enter a profession, workshop, or business 
college. An occupation which by long hours of work over- 
develops a certain set of muscles and nerves before maturity, 
will produce an abnormal development and an. unstable tem- 
perament. Co-education at this age is also harmful, the result 
being premature development, and elopement marriages, or 
arrested sexual development and extreme independence, or 
marriage and continual suffering, owing to physical defects 
and lack of knowledge of the care of the human body, and of 
domestic science. 

Every woman is a born nurse. How valuable would it be, 
then, to give every young girl, beginning at the age of twelve, 
a rudimentary course in nursing and in the care of children ; 
in the art of selecting, combining, and preparing foods ; and in 
the art of housekeeping. An industrial high school course with 
such technical work as is suitable for woman's sensitive brain 
would develop her brain and body in every direction and make 
the future woman a healthy mother of healthy offspring. 
Those muscles and nerve centers which have been well devel- 
oped during puberty will be the strongest throughout life. 

The store, the factory, the office, and the business college 
are no places for a girl under twenty years of age. If for 
some reason she has no desire to follow her natural calling in 



12 PREFACE 

life, there will be plenty of time to prepare herself for other 
work after the age of twenty. 

If a law could be enforced to compel every woman to pre- 
sent a certificate of health and maturity, and a diploma of 
qualification when applying for a marriage license, much un- 
necessary misery, disease, and many untimely deaths could be 
avoided. 

The feeding as well as the mental, moral and physical train- 
iny of children is the natural profession for women. Children 
have in them all the possibilities for good and evil. Mistakes 
during this period will affect the child throughout its life. 
Thousands of infants and young children are killed every year 
by wrong feeding and environment. A large percentage of 
brilliant and exceptional children fill the jails and insane asy- 
lums. Idleness, stupidity, and criminal tendencies are diseases, 
and diseases can be avoided by right living. Children with 
hereditary weaknesses require double care and attention ; but 
remember the wonderful law of nature works always toward 
the normal ; the good tends to overcome the bad. 

If the brain of a child becomes starved by the use of sweet- 
meats, and clogged by the use of rich condiments and highly sea- 
soned food, or by an excess of starchy foods, there is always 
great danger, and more so, if the child is exceptionally bright 
and active. A large amount of arterial blood is sent to the 
brain, and if this blood contains much waste matter, the elim- 
inating organs will soon be overworked and all kinds of dis- 
eases are liable to follow, such as brain fever, softening and 
subluxation of bones, epilepsy, chorea, meningitis, paralysis, 
tuberculosis of the lungs, bones, and mesentery. 

Many young women who, through wrong food, environment 
and unsuitable educational systems, have dwarfed their bodies, 
find motherhood a great burden. They have to pay the penalty 
for the sin that is committed on them. Their children will 
not be so strong, and will have less resisting power, and their 
grandchildren, if there be any, will land in the institutions for 
the incurable, if the careless feeding and wrong habits are kept 
up by each succeeding generation. On the other hand, if the 
progress of degeneration is checked by right living, the work 
and time invested will be well repaid during one generation. 



PART ONE 



CHAPTER I. 

"THE BLOOD IS THE LIFE." 

Its Structure and Function Depend on the 
Building Material. 

Foods are substances which, when introduced into the sys- 
tem, supply the necessary material for growth, renewal and 
maintenance of the vital structures. Food is anything that 
nourishes. 

Foods must contain the same elements found in our bodies. 
The body requires a combination of different food elements in 
proper proportion to produce a suitable diet. Foods are 
divided into five classes: water, protein, fats, carbohydrates 
and mineral matters. 

Air and sun are also foods, but are not generally spoken of 
as nutrient. 

WATER. 

Our bodies consist of about two-thirds water. It helps to 
regulate the body processes, and supplies building material. 
Watery fruits and vegetables contain pure distilled water. 
The amount of water required for the average individual dif- 
fers greatly. If water is added to our foods in the cooking 
process, a lesser amount is required for drinking. Wholesome, 
non-stimulating food will call for a normal supply of water 
between meals. 

PROTEINS. 

These are sometimes called albumen, and they supply the 
body with nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus. They are great 



14 FOOD 

tissue builders ; they also furnish energy and heat, in combina- 
tion with fats and carbohydrates. 

Sources of Proteins : 

Legumes, lean meats, nuts, cheese, whites of eggs, fish, and 
the glutens of the grains. Milk contains proteins in the right 
proportion with fats and sugars to make it suitable as a food 
for infants. Oats, wheat, and rye contain more protein than 
otner grains, and if no other protein foods are on hand, these 
can maintain health for a long time without harm. (For com- 
binations, see introduction of "Poor Man's Bill of Fare.") 

FATS. 

They are obtained from the vegetable and animal kingdoms. 
They supply heat and energy in the most concentrated form, 
and are also flesh-builders. In diseased conditions, where 
economy of nerve force is required, fats in combination with 
acids, minerals and gelatine can form a substitute for part of 
the protein foods. 

CARBOHYDRATES. 

These are found in large percentage in cereals and in fruits 
which contain stones and seeds, and in underground vegetables, 
including the lighter starches, such as sago, agar agar, sea 
moss and gum. Milk can serve as a carbohydrate for special 
conditions; being evenly proportioned with fats and protein 
it contains little waste. A certain amount of carbohydrate 
foods in the form of cereals is, necessary in our daily diet, 
as they are rich in lime and fat yielding material which is 
required for ligamentous and other elastic tissue. People who 
live on fruits, greens and nuts, or on fruits, greens and meats 
only, require a larger amount of protein food, in order to make 
up for the loss of cereals. 

MINERAL MATTER. 

In an organic 'form, we find mineral matter in large propor- 
tions in green leaf vegetables, small fruits and berries, bran, 
rye, green peas, string beans, tomatoes, yolks of eggs and in 
all the outer skins of legumes, grains and fruits. The import- 
ance of the mineral elements in our foods has been little under- 
stood, so far. Of late, health reformers are beginning to real- 
ize that many serious diseases, such as tuberculosis, insanity 



FOOD 15 

and malnutrition, are the result of mineral starvation. Three- 
fourths of these valuable minerals are removed from our foods 
daily by modern milling, bleaching, and polishing of rice, 
wheat, corn and all the other grains. Not alone the minerals, 
but necessary volatile oils, acids, and ferments are removed 
by these processes. Refined white flour and sugar have been 
on the market for the last hundred years; and much time and 
health have been wasted with the writing of fashionable cook 
books, and the manufacture of anemic snow white cakes, crack- 
ers, biscuits and soft putrefying puddings and desserts, pre- 
pared with skim milk~~sugar and eggs. The deficiency of 
minerals in these products has created an abnormal desire for 
salts, spices, and chemically pure sugar, followed by an addi- 
tional craving for intoxicating beverages and liquors. The 
latter articles cannot enter into the composition of perfect 
teeth and bone, or gray nervous tissue ; therefore, the result 
is premature death and many new diseases. 

It is my desire to present in this book such -food combina- 
tions as perfect as can be produced from food material with 
our present methods of milling and preliminary treatment. 
Many people have become so delicate in structure that they 
cannot use coarse breads and cereals ; therefore, a variety of 
different cereal foods have been included. Vegetable foods, 
such as are rich in minerals, have been added to the breakfast 
foods in place of sugar and beverages. In order to supply the 
body with the necessary amount of minerals, we must learn, to 
eat greens for breakfast, until our so-called breakfast 'foods 
have improved in quality. 

All foods possess potential or latent energy. The sun is the 
great positive element, and plants store up the sun.'s energy. 
It is transferred to us through the eating of plants and animal 
foods. Through the process of oxidation this energy is set 
free in our bodies, and appears as heat and muscular power. 
This energy contained in foods is known as heat or fuel value, 
and is expressed in terms of a heat unit or calorie. A calorie 
i? the amount of heat necessary to raise one kilogram of water, 
one degree centigrade. This is spoken of as a large calorie, 
which is used in determining the energy value of food. The 
small calorie is i/iooo of a large calorie. 



16 FOOD. 

The physiological fuel and energy value of the different 
foods is as follows : 

I gram of Protein yields 4 Calories 

i gram of Fat yields 9 Calories 

i gram of Carbohydrates yields 4 Calories 

To determine the energy value of a food or combination of 
foods it is necessary to know first its composition. Then de- 
termine the weight of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in grams 
and multiply these weights accordingly. 



CHAPTER II. 

STUDY OF FOODS. 

The average homekeeper knows little of the nutritive value 
and chemical composition of the food she buys. The desire 
to tickle the palate enters more into the selection of food than 
reason or judgment. Others, who have studied along certain 
lines without the fundamental training for this work, often 
make greater mistakes in the selection and combination of 
foods than if they had not studied the subject at all. 

It is not sufficient to know just which foods are suitable to 
the individual and which are harmful ; it is necessary to have 
a fairly well balanced diet which contains the correct propor- 
tions of protein and non-protein elements. 

The following pages present briefs on the value and chemical 
nature of different foods not mentioned in recipes : 



VEGETABLE FOODS. 

These are divided into several classes. They are : Legumes, 
cereals, roots, bulbs, tubers, leaf, flower and fruit vegetables, 
All plants are made up of a mass of cells, each consisting of a 
membranous wall, enclosing a gelatinous mass, in which lie 
imbedded the nucleus or center of cell activity and minute 
grains of starch or other material which the plant has manu- 
factured. 

In young plants these cell walls are called cellulose ; later 
wood cells begin to develop. The wood cells grow into 
fibrous material, called woody fibre. In poorly grown or stale 
vegetables this woody tissue becomes very hard and thick, and 
therefore is indigestible. For this reason it is best that all 
green vegetables are grown quickly and eaten while they are 
fresh. When fresh they will snap crisply. Peas, green corn 
and string beans will cook in one-third of the time if used 
directly after gathering, instead of being kept for several days 
before using. 



18 STUDY OF FOODS. 

THE LEGUMES. 

The legumes are rich in vegetable protein, and differ from 
flesh foods on account of being richer in protein and minerals 
and less stimulating. They are free from animal intoxication. 

DRIED PEAS. 

Green peas are richer in minerals than yellow peas, beans 
or lentils, the protein being in. the form of legumin and easier 
to digest. They are very purifying and should be eaten freely, 
especially during the cold winter or rainy season. They are a 
suitable food for the brain-worker as well as for the muscular- 
worker, and can be prepared in many different ways. Yellow 
peas are an excellent food for muscular-workers. 

DRIED BEANS. 

They contain more of the protein than peas, lentils or beef. 
They are therefore a very rich food and should not be con- 
sumed in large quantities. The brown, red, and black beans 
are richer in iron and minerals, and are therefore more suitable 
in cold weather. The hulls of all legumes are difficult to digest, 
therefore it is important to soak legumes before cooking. In 
countries where the water is hard, it is well to have soft water 
on hand for the cooking of legumes. If rain water cannot be 
obtained, boil a kettle of water each day and set aside to cool 
for cooking purposes. Legumes may be soaked with hot or 
cold water. Green lima beans should be put to cook in boiling 
water without soaking, like all green vegetables. 

LENTILS. 

They are rich in iron and should be used freely in cold 
\\ eather. Boiled onions are a good addition, in place of fat 
meat. GREEN PEAS AND BEANS. 

Green peas differ from other green vegetables. They are 
richer in protein and can serve as a meat substitute during the 
summer. String-beans resemble the green leaf vegetables in 
their composition, but do not contain sufficient protein to serve 
as a meat substitute. They are very purifying to the liver and 
intestines, and should be eaten freely by people of a bilious 
temperament. 



STUDY OF FOODS. 19 

CABBAGE. 

Cabbage is rich in minerals. It can be made very indigesti- 
ble by careless preparation. Raw cabbage is easily digested if 
chopped very fine and mixed with grated potato and mayon- 
naise dressing. Cooked cabbage should be treated with acid 
and mixed with the yolk of an egg if it disagrees. Some people 
prefer sprouts to cabbage. They resemble each other very 
much in composition. Cabbage contains more water and cellu- 
lose. It is best to use only the innermost part of cabbage, if it 
disagrees. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

This belongs to the cabbage family. It is rich in sulphur 
Liid is one of the most easily digested vegetables, if properly 
prepared. If it disagrees, treat it with acid or serve it for 
breakfast instead of for dinner. 

CELERY. 

Celery contains valuable minerals and is soothing to the 
nervous system. Celery roots are rich in fat and a healing food 
for people with kidney, liver, and intestinal trouble. The green 
stalks of celery root should never be thrown away. They can 
be tied into a bunch and cooked with soups of meat or legumes. 
Celery is a very valuable food for people with a bilious tem- 
perament. 

ASPARAGUS. 

This is an easily digested vegetable and resembles celery. 
As a food for medicinal purposes it may be eaten raw or 
cooked. 

CARROTS AND PARSNIPS. 

They resemble each other, carrots being richer in sugar; 
the parsnip contains a little gluten. They may be eaten in the 
raw state with good effect. 

TURNIPS. 

Turnips contain some valuable minerals, but being rich in 
sugar and water, they are liable to ferment in weak stomachs, 
especially if eaten with lean meats, white breads or other foods, 



20 STUDY OF FOODS. 

which are poor in fat. They should not be eaten in the middle 
of the day by people who do active work. If they disagree at 
night, they may be eaten for breakfast in- combination with fat 
meats or stale bread and butter. Yellow turnips are richer in 
nutriment than white turnips. Raw turnips are wholesome if 
they agree. Never combine turnips with other starchy foods 
at the same meal, such as potatoes, rice, white flour prepara- 
tions, apples or cucumbers. 

CORN. 

Green corn is rich in fat and protein, and can form a perfect 
meal during the summer if combined with tomatoes. Do not 
cook the corn if it is agreeable raw. Canned corn should be 
used with care for people with intestinal weaknesses. If used 
for soups it should be strained and diluted with an. equal 
amount of hot water before thickening. 

TOMATO. 

The tomato stimulates peristalsis and is a wonderful tonic 
for the liver. It is one of the most perfect fruits, rich in oxalic 
acid and iron, and unsurpassed as a medicinal food. It contains 
a vegetable calomel and serves as a purifier for the liver in 
bilious conditions. It can be prepared and combined in many 
different ways. It may be one of the first articles given to 
a patient after an operation, serving as a food and tonic ; it 
counteracts the sweetish taste of the chloroform and prevents 
fatty degeneration of the liver. 

Whether a food is eaten raw or cooked it is important that 
it be ripe. (Not ripened on the market.) For people with 
weak digestive organs, the best way to serve tomatoes is in 
the form of sterilized strained juice over toast in combination, 
with milk or in the form of soup from canned strained toma- 
toes. The theory that tomatoes are liable to produce cancer 
is entirely unfounded. Any kind of food if eaten in excess and 
wrongly combined will aid in the progress of disease, but all 
natural foods rightly combined are wholesome if eaten accord- 
ing to needs of the individual. 

Tomatoes combine well with fatty foods, eggs, cheese, 
meats and fish. 



STUDY OF FOODS. 21 

LETTUCE. 

This is the most desirable greens on our tables and combines 
well with almost any kind of food. Being rich in minerals and 
a!kaloidal extracts, it tends to render the digestive fluids alka- 
line and promotes oxidation and nutrition. If lettuce is eaten 
in proper proportion with other foods at the morning or noon 
meal, it has a sedative effect and keeps an excitable constitu- 
tion, better balanced throughout the day. People with delicate 
stomachs should not eat lettuce at the evening meal. All raw- 
salads prepared from greens and super-acid fruits are best 
eaten at the beginning of the meal, or with the meat dish at 
the morning or noon meal. 

CUCUMBERS. 

They are a valuable food and should be eaten almost daily 
by growing children and anemic people, especially if much 
muscular work is required. The cucumber is considered an 
indigestible article of food by people with perverted appetites. 
The way in which the cucumber is usually prepared in the 
average household renders it unfit to eat. The extraction of 
the natural juice and the treatment with salt make the cucum- 
ber tough and indigestible, and, if eaten in combination with 
half a dozen other articles, it produces indigestion. Cucumbers 
should never be eaten at night. 

NUTS. 

Nuts are high in nutritive value, and are better evenly com- 
bined with non-protein elements than flesh foods are. They 
are rich in fat and minerals, and form an ideal diet in combina- 
tion with raw fruits and greens. They are not sufficiently ap- 
preciated as a food, and receive much unjust criticism as to 
their digestibility. All nuts are wholesome. The right com- 
bination and proportion, and the time of day when eaten, are 
of great importance. The kind of activity as' well as individual 
peculiarities have much to do with likes and dislikes or re- 
quirements of certain foods. 

ALMONDS AND BRAZIL NUTS. 

These nuts feed the higher nerve centers and generate a 
high quality of intelligence. 



22 STUDY OF FOODS. 

WALNUTS, PINE KERNELS AND CHESTNUTS. 

These are excellent for those who wish to put on flesh. Care 
must be taken not to overtax the liver. People who have been 
accustomed to a large amount of bread or other starchy foods 
should begin with a small amount, and substitute them for 
bread. If they disagree, use lemon, cranberries, oranges or 
fruit salads with them. Walnuts supply the larger nerve 
structures. They are well balanced in all the elements and 
are excellent for people doing hard, muscular work. Sweet 
dried fruits also form a good combination with nuts. Chest- 
nuts resemble cereals on account of being rich in starch. They 
contain less protein, fat and minerals than other nuts, and 
therefore combine well with such foods as supply these ele- 
ments. Baked and boiled chestnuts are generally more agree- 
able than raw ones. Pine nuts are rich in both protein and fat. 

COCOANUTS. 
They are rich in. starch and fat and resemble the cereals 

closel y- HAZELNUTS. 

They are a valuable food, but require thorough mastication. 

THE PEANUT. 

The peanut is a very nutritious nut, but rather difficult of 
digestion for some people. It resembles beans and peas, and 
is sometimes classed as a legume. Excess of nuts at one meal, 
or nuts which have been poorly masticated, may cause severe 
disturbances of the liver and stomach. If the teeth are poor, 
the nuts may be ground, but even then great care must be 
exercised to insure their proper insalivation. Cooked nut 
foods and all vegetarian dishes to which strained legumes, nut- 
butter, eggs and other rich foods are added, should not be in- 
dulged in by people with weak stomachs. 

NUT-BUTTER. 

Great care should be exercised in the preparation of foods 
with nut-butter. Never spread it on bread without first dilut- 
ing it with an equal amount of water. Do not keep it on the 
shelf like ordinary butter after it has been mixed with water; 
prepare only sufficient to last for twenty-four hours, and keep 
it on ice. 



STUDY OF FOODS. 23 

FRUITS. 

There are three classes of fruit: acid, sub-acid, and sweet 
fruits. * 

Fresh raw fruits, if eaten in the right proportion with other 
articles, are wholesome. The habit of eating a large amount 
of acid fruits at the beginning of the morning meal is not neces- 
sary. If a heavy meal is eaten, in the evening, remaining half 
digested in the stomach over night and putrefying, then acid 
fruits will cleanse the stomach in the morning. . The better way 
is to go to bed with an empty stomach and there will be no 
need of cleansing in the morning. People of a highly nervous 
temperament should not eat the very sweet fruits at the morn- 
ing or noon meal, as at this time they are too stimulating. 

Hot house fruits out of season are health destroying. Cer- 
tain fruits, such as apples, plums, tomatoes, apricots, grapes, 
figs, bananas and cranberries, will keep for a long time in the 
natural state, if properly preserved. Some of them can be 
dried and used in the winter. Fresh fancy summer fruits are 
not required during the winter by healthy individuals, neither 
are canned fruits, jams or jellies. 

The canning of fruits during hot summer days is a health 
destroying occupation and a waste of time and money. Fresh 
fruits prepared with a large amount of water and sugar are 
Irlle better than beer, wine and whiskey. If such fruits are 
eaten with yeast bread, potatoes and a variety of other food- 
stuffs, they set up fermentation and burden the eliminating 
organs. A few jars of sterilized fruit juice should be prepared 
and kept on hand for medicinal purposes only. 

Fruits are an important article of diet, but few people know 
how to use them wisely. A large percentage of deaths in 
young children is due directly to the wrong use of fruits. 
Many forms of infantile paralysis, intestinal disease and mal- 
nutrition in general are due to the lack of knowledge of the 
.scientific combination of fruits with other articles of food, so 
as to furnish a wholesome meal. 

Many teachers of Domestic Science and writers in monthly 
magazines seem to have forgotten, entirely of what an ordinary 
mixed diet should consist. Their bills-of-fare are becoming 



24 STUDY OF FOODS. 

more complex all the time. We find combinations, such as 
banana fritters, custard, meat, potatoes, nuts, milk, biscuits, 
dates, several kinds of vegetables, puddings, cheese, coffee, 
cake and ice cream, suggested for one meal (sometimes less, 
other times more than this). Any intelligent, thinking person 
must realize that such a mixture, besides being a great waste, 
will turn the stomach of the strongest individual into a yeast 
pot. Those with strong eliminating organs, who take plenty 
of out-door exercise and recreation of some kind, may be able 
to throw off the excess of poison for a long period, while 
others endowed with less vigor will suffer from the effects 
within a short time. 

People who live on cooked foods consisting mainly of meat, 
bread, sugar, soups, puddings, cooked cereals, milk, etc., should 
realize that they have already filled their systems with foods 
which contain a large amount of water, and therefore will 
overburden their intestines and kidneys by adding a liberal 
amount of fruits to such a dietary. There is always great dan- 
ger of fermentation and putrefaction, especially if constipation 
sets in, and here we have all the dangers of modern diseases, 
which begin with mal-nutrition, be it from under- or over-feed- 
ing. Only the most perfect specimens of men and women are 
safe from danger. Why? Because their instincts lead them 
to choose the right articles in the right combination, and at 
the table they know "when to stop," while an individual with 
weak sensory nerves does not feel the effects of satisfaction 
from the food until dullness, pain or discomfort appear. It is 
from this lattter class mostly, that we have our health reform- 
ers, while the former class with their perfect battery, which 
can turn the poorest food materials into first grade tissue, look 
on us as diet cranks and faddists. 

The man who ate three square meals all his life, indulged 
in tea, coffee, liquor and tobacco, was never sick and lived to 
be 100 years old, probably could have lengthened his years to 
300, had he not been so dangerously strong. 

The menus suggested in this book are made up carefully and 
scientifically, so that each individual can easily find a diet 
suited to his temperament, environment, age and occupation. 
Nuts contain a high percentage of protein, and therefore form 



STUDY OF FOODS. 25 

an ideal dietary in combination with 'fruits. Meats, eggs, 
cheese, cream and fish are the next best articles suitable to 
combine with fruits ; raw greens are an excellent addition, but 
breads, puddings, sugars, beverages, mushes and cooked vege- 
tables are better left out at a meal if an abundance of fruits 
are taken, especially at dinner, or the amount of watery foods 
taken into the body during twenty-four hours will not be in 
the proper proportion to the solids. Dry legumes are very 
rich in protein, but being dissolved with water during the cook- 
ing process are less suited to combine with raw fruits, especial- 
ly for those suffering with flatulence or kidney disorders. 
Apples, tomatoes and vegetables combine best with legumes. 
Apples and tomatoes, being of the most perfect type of foods, 
combine well with all classes of protein foods, including cereals. 
They should be staple articles in every household. As to other 
fiuit combinations, study recipes and menus, and keep in mind 
that no matter how valuable an article may be, excess is a 
poison. 

Those who live mainly upon dry foods, such as uncooked 
cereals and nuts, can safely make their morning and evening 
meal of fruits alone, while others who live like the average, 
if they attempt to make a meal of fruits alone, and continue 
to do active work, will soon fail in health. 

BERRIES. 

All berries are rich in minerals and feed the brain cells. They 
contain traces of protein. Blackberries and huckleberries are 
rich in volatile oils and iron, and are of great medicinal value. 
They are excellent for the evening meal in the form of gruels 
and drinks. 

People with digestive troubles should be careful in combin- 
ing raw blackberries \vith other foods. They are rich in pro- 
tein and may take the place of part of the meat dish on hot 
summer days. They should never be used as a dessert after a 
heavy meal. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

Strawberries are the first fruit to make their appearance in 
the spring. They are rich in iron and valuable acids. As they 



26 STUDY OF FOODS. 

are in season for a long time they should not be eaten to ex- 
cess, never more than once per day. From three to eight 
ounces, according to age, is sufficient for one meal. If perfect- 
ly fresh, they combine well with fresh cream or milk. Yeast 
bread, red meats or legumes should not be eaten at the same 
meal with strawberries. Berries which have undergone slight 
decomposition should be placed in a mason fruit jar with a 
little water and be sterilized. This juice will keep for several 
days in a cold place and can be used for the flavoring of milk, 
or for softening zwieback which is to be served with cream or 
milk. If the juice has undergone fermentation reboil it before 
using. It may be used for fruit puddings or fruit gruels or be 
mixed with other fruit juices. In this way everything is util- 
ized and nothing wasted. 

CHERRIES. 

The cherry season is short. Therefore, they should be eaten 
almost daily. All varieties are wholesome. If desired, several 
kinds may be mixed at one meal. They combine well with egg 
foods, whole wheat, cornmeal and fish. They may be eaten 
at the beginning or at the end of a meal or by themselves. 
People with weak stomachs should not eat them at night. 

BLACKBERRIES. 

They are a valuable and nutritious fruit and can form a 
perfect meal in combination with light cereal foods. They 
have little preservative properties and therefore should be 
eaten only when perfectly fresh. For young children or people 
with intestinal weakness, only the juice should be used in the 
form of wine or gruels. 

RASPBERRIES. 

They are a light and delicious fruit. They combine well with 
milk, egg foods, or nuts, and can be served morning, noon or 
ni^ht. 

PEACHES, PEARS AND APRICOTS. 
They are all three rich fn sugar and cellulose, and can form 
a substitute for part of the cereal foods during hot summer 
days. (See recipes for Salads.) 



STUDY OF FOODS. 27 

THE PINEAPPLE. 

The pineapple contains bromaline and is of medicinal value 
in the treatment of certain stomach disorders. It is not a 
necessary article for the table of people of moderate means. 

BANANAS. 

They are a very nutritious fruit and can partially replace the 
cereals. If combined with green leaves, and lemon, they can 
form a perfect meal. The bitter substance which is contained 
in the inner skin of the banana should be scraped off with a 
knife and added to the bulk, as it counteracts the sweet flavor 
of the banana and adds to its digestibility. Baked bananas 
are not necessary for a healthy stomach. 

APPLES. 

They are among the most perfect of fruits. People who have 
difficulty in digesting a sufficient amount of cereals should eat 
apples almost daily. If raw apples disagree, they can be made 
agreeable by combining them with fat meats or oil in. the form 
of a salad. Baked apples and apple sauce are also good, pro- 
vided they are not spoiled with too much sugar. Some apples 
are fibrous and muscle-feeding; others are richer in phosphates 
ai.d valuable minerals. For salads use tart apples. 

GRAPES. 

Grapes are a valuable fruit for the table if eaten in the right 
proportion with other foods which contain fat and protein. 
They are rich in sugar and tartaric acid. As a medicinal fruit 
they may be eaten in large quantities by themselves. 

NECTARINES. . 

Like the pineapple, they belong to the luxurious fruits and 
are adapted for people with a large purse. They are rich in 
sugar and starch, with a small amount of cellulose. 

ORANGES, GRAPEFRUIT, LEMONS AND LIMES. 

They all belong to the citric acid group, and are of all the 
fruits, the richest in valuable acids, which in the process of 
digestion are converted into salts, rendering the blood more 
alkaline. The latter three should be used, in greater quantities 
in countries near the coast or in low and damp districts, espe- 
cially during the rainy season. The outer skin is rich in vola- 



28 STUDY OF FOODS. 

tile oils and is useful in the preparation of fruit-and-milk 
soups. The white rind is useful as a medicine, for patients 
who suffer from malaria. A small amount of it chewed while 
sipping a glass of fresh milk will greatly add to the digesti- 
bility of the milk and serve as a germicide to the liver. The 
juice of one-quarter of a lemon may be taken in. connection 
with the skin of one-half a lemon, in combination with a glass 
of milk. During fever, the skin should be carefully expecto- 

FRUIT JELLIES. 

If prepared from fruit juice and cane sugar only, they are 
powerful stimulants and have little food value, for the reason 
that they arouse the nerve cells to extreme activity and rapid 
oxidation. They furnish no food for the nerve cells, and the 
nutritious elements in the other food materials taken in com- 
bination with these jellies pass out of the body without being 
assimilated, or produce congestion and inflammatory conditions. 
Even natural stimulants, in the form of raw fruits, can become 
harmful if taken, in excess, or in the wrong combinations, un- 
suitable to the individual requirements. If the glycogen-mak- 
ing function of the liver becomes overburdened, the result will 
be diabetes, neuralgia or starch-poison. 

COMPOTES OR STEWED FRUITS. 

They are more wholesome and economical than jams and 
jellies, which are prepared with large amounts of sugar. 

They are best served with the meat dish or with some sub- 
stantial pudding. If served with sponge cake at the end of a 
meal, the digestive juice becomes acid, and produces fermenta- 
tion and mal-nutrition. 

PLUMS. 

Green, red and blue plums are all valuable fruits. The blue 
plum is rich in iron, minerals, and sugar, and is, next to apples 
and tomatoes, one of the most perfect fruits. It has great pre- 
serving qualities and if picked on a dry, sunny day and placed 
carefully in straw in a dry, cold place, will keep until Christ- 
mas. For combination, see menus and salads. 

People who have distress from eating raw plums should let 
them alone or eat them in the dried state only. 



STUDY OF FOODS. 29 

FIGS AND DATES. 

They have an average of thirty per cent water, are rich in 
sugar and contain some protein and saline matter. They are 
an excellent food for people who are fond of sweets. They are 
more wholesome than canned summer fruits. However, they 
should not be indulged in during hot summer days, or in the 
spring time when the brain needs relaxation. 

THE WATERMELON. 

This is the largest of the melon fruits, containing sugar, 
salts, cellulose and distilled water. It is an excellent food 
during hot weather. People who suffer from chronic kidney 
disorders should only indulge in it in small quantities at a 
time, and never combine it with mushy or other starchy foods. 
A few drops of lemon is a good addition, in place of free salt. 

MUSKMELON. 

This fruit is also rich in sugar and cellulose. What has been 
said of watermelon in reference to combination also applies to 
this fruit. CRANBERRIES. 

Cranberries, like gooseberries, currants and lemons, are puri- 
fying to the blood and very valuable as a food in malarial dis- 
tricts. Cranberries combine well with oatmeal, cornmeal, pork, 
chicken, turkey and veal. Use no more sugar for the prepara- 
tion than is absolutely necessary to counteract the tart taste. 
Cranberry jelly prepared with pure sugar is unwholesome. 
Raw cranberries and raw celery are a good combination for 
salad. 



CEREALS. 

Cereals are the most perfect products of the vegetable king- 
dom, and make fairly well balanced foods. They are deficient 
in fat, with the exception of corn and oats. In the processes 
of milling and cooking, cereals have been more abused than 
any other foods, by depriving them of their valuable minerals, 
and by compounding them into soft putrefying puddings or rich 
cakes. Concentrated or predigested cereals, as advertised 
under the name of breakfast foods, cannot take the place of 



30 STUDY OF FOODS. 

ordinary rolled, whole, or steel cut cereals ; they have lost val- 
uable salts and lime during the process of baking and they also 
deprive the walls of the stomach of the normal stimulus, which 
is necessary for thorough utilization. 

Well boiled cereal foods in the form of dumplings, macaroni, 
noodles or whole cereals are stimulating and heating to the 
whole alimentary tract, they take longer to digest, and are more 
thoroughly utilized by the system. Predigested cereals and 
zwieback are more suitable for the evening meal, or at the 
end of the noon meal, when the body has expended energy. 
Shredded wheat and zwieback may be used with benefit for 
breakfast, if a sufficient amount of raw fruits or greens is eaten 
with them, but if they are used in combination with other 
predigested foods, such as milk or sugar, it gives the intestine 
nothing to do. For the evening meal, toasted breads and ce- 
reals combine well with such foods as supply the lack of lime, 
fats and minerals : cream, fruit-gruels, yolks of eggs, gelatine, 
sago, milk and green foods. 

WHEAT. 

Wheat can be used the year around. In cooking cereals it 
is very important to start with the right quantity of water, and 
allow each starch granule to burst by fast boiling during the 
first twenty or thirty minutes. After this, let it cook slowly for 
twenty or thirty minutes longer, or until it is done. It is not 
necessary to cook cereals for several hours in order to make 
them fit for the human stomach. If well boiled cereals disagree, 
they are generally poorly prepared and allowed to get pasty 
before the starch granules have burst, or else they are combined 
with raw sugar and cream, which produces fermentation. 

RYE. 

Rye is richer in minerals and contains less starch than wheat. 
It is not superior to wheat, but it is one of the oldest and most 
perfect foods, and is the staff of life to some of the healthiest 
and strongest races of the old world. It is laxative, and be- 
cause of this it is more suitable for certain individuals than 
for others. Rye is a good winter food; during the summer 
we have many valuable berries which supply the system with 



STUDY OF FOODS. 31 

certain minerals, therefore we require less of rye bread, or rye 
preparations, during this time of the year. 

Rye combines well with all starchy fruits and vegetables, 
which are deficient in minerals, such as potatoes, pumpkins, 
squash, melons, turnips, carrots, beets, bananas, cucumbers, 
rice and corn. It also combines well with sweet fruits. Apples, 
pork, veal, lamb, cheese, eggs, cream, milk, bacon and oily foods 
are all good additions to rye. Boiled rye and starchy foods are 
unsuitable combinations. 

Whole rye or wheat bread should never be eaten fresh. It 
should be kept in a bread box, with good ventilation, in a dry 
place, or near the stove. Sun dried bread is the best. 

OATS. 

Oats are rich in fat and lime, and like wheat and rye belong- 
to the most perfect foods. A fireless cooker is a convenient 
apparatus for the preparation of oats and wheat. They should 
be thoroughly cooked for at least half an hour before setting 
them into the fireless cooker. 

RICE. 

Rice, although low in protein and fat, is one of the most 
easily digested of all cereals, and is especially suitable for brain 
workers and people of sedentary habits. This book contains a 
large number of different recipes for the preparation of rice. 

SAGO AND TAPIOCA. 

They are manufactured from certain, palms and roots, and 
belong to the lighter forms of cereals. They are easily digested 
if soaked for several hours before cooking, and can be partially 
substituted for the heavier cereals. Cornstarch, arrowroot, 
potato-flour and agar agar belong to the same class. They 
are all valuable for the sick and for young children. 

BARLEY. 

Barley is also rich in lime ; it should take a more prominent 
place among food substances than it does. Pearl barley should 
be soaked with soft water before cooking. If it is to be 
strained, mash it up thoroughly with a potato masher, and pour 
more boiling water over it after the first liquid is strained off. 



32 STUDY OF FOODS. 

ANIMAL FOODS. 

EGGS. 

Eggs contain all the elements necessary for the building up 
of a young animal ; they also contain all the elements which 
can be found in. the human body. The eggs of hens are used 
most commonly. The chemical combination of the whole egg 
and that of the brain and nervous system have much in com- 
mon. The white of the egg contains about eighty per cent 
water, twelve of albumen, a small amount of fat and some salts. 
For medicinal purposes, eggs should be fresh, directly from the 
nest. Eggs are deficient in minerals and should be combined 
with foods which are rich in minerals. 

CHEESE. 

Cheese is one of the most economical and nutritious of foods, 
and a true meat substitute. To serve cheese after a dinner is a 
wasteful extravagance, and dangerous to health. Cheese com- 
bines well with bread, macaroni, potato and other cereals; 
raw greens are also a good addition. Cooking or baking cheese 
makes it indigestible. Grated or sliced is the best way to 
serve it. People who have difficulty in digesting cheese should 
always combine it with raw apples, onions, or tomatoes and 
lettuce, in the form of a salad. If it still disagrees, leave out 
the cereals entirely at the meal, or use black bread with it. A 
combination of cheese, eggs and milk in the form of a Welsh 
rarebit makes a heavy and indigestible meal, and should only 
be indulged in by people who are very strong, and exercise a 
great deal out of doors. 

People who live almost entirely on cooked foodstuffs and 
white flour bread, find meat a necessary article of food, and 
consume it in larger quantities than would be necessary, if 
whole wheat bread and raw fruits and greens were used. Under 
the present systems of forced and improper feeding of animals, 
and the preservation of meats by cold storage, flesh foods are 
becoming more dangerous. There is no need for such an 
excess in the production of meat, except to satisfy our habits. 
]* human beings and animals are fed by force, they are not 



STUDY OF FOODS. 33 

healthy. Flesh, eggs and milk from animals which are fed by 
force, are unwholesome and inferior in quality. 

Under certain conditions and in cold climates, meat is a 
necessity, therefore the- feeding of animals should be under the 
observation of health officers. We need quality more than 
quantity. 

Pork, although condemned by many people as unfit for food, 
is a wholesome article, if the animal is fed upon dry, substan- 
tial food. Pork requires a longer time to digest than other 
meat, and therefore it should not be eaten at the evening meal. 
Pork was considered as an unclean food by the ancient Jews ; 
perhaps the reason for this was that the Jew's system did not 
require pork, because of his constitution and the climatic con- 
ditions. Fat pork is a specific food for the kidneys ; it is less 
stimulating and easier to oxidize than any other meat. 

Beef is perhaps the most economical meat for family use. A 
good quality of meat should contain both fat and lean. All 
meats should be well soaked and washed before cooking. Cold 
meats are sometimes more agreeable than hot meats. 

Veal, lamb, chicken and game are all wholesome meats if 
eaten in. moderation and at the right time of the year. Fresh 
meats should not be served oftener than once per day, or better 
still, three times per week. The internal organs and glands, 
such as the lungs, liver, kidneys, tongue and stomach, are very 
nutritious. Sausages, if prepared from fresh, clean meat, and 
not highly seasoned, are cheaper and more nourishing than 
canned meats, and often preferable to fresh meat, which has 
hung a long time in a meat shop. The internal organs contain 
much lime and organic salts, as they feed the glands of the 
body; they should be well soaked before cooking, in order to 
drain the thick and impure blood out of them. 

Beefsteak, chops and roasts should be slightly salted before 
they are cooked. Free salt sprinkled on meat, or other dry 
foods, before serving, is injurious to the lining of the stomach 
and blood vessels ; lemon can be used instead. Many people 
have an abnormal craving for salt. This is a symptom of 
anemia ; the system lacks minerals. The only way to supply 
the necessary elements is by taking salt in the organized state 
in raw greens and fruits. Free salt can satisfy such craving 



34 STUDY OF FOODS. 

temporarily, but it creates an abnormal thirst. Raw apples, 
tomatoes and all other acid fruits, in, combination with greens, 
are the best additions to meats. 

FISH. 

Fish is a valuable article of food. It is less stimulating than 
lean meat, and easier to digest and oxidize; for this reason it 
can be recommended for brain workers. It contains a large 
amount of phosphorus and nitrogen, and if properly combined 
with foods which are rich in minerals, such as apples, tomatoes, 
lemons and greens, fish is quickly utilized. Fish and whole rye 
bread is also an excellent combination. Fish being soft, it is 
necessary that it be thoroughly masticated. Fish can become 
very dangerous as a food when not fresh. 

MILK. 

Milk is found indispensable in some cases of sickness, espe- 
cially in fevers. The greatest care should be exercised in get- 
ting clean, fresh and perfect milk, and in keeping it in a cold, 
clean atmosphere after delivery. Milk may be given as a food, 
raw, boiled, sterilized, pasteurized, or peptonized, and can be 
modified with water or other foods in many different ways. 
The best and most suitable method of preparing it for the 
patient must be left to the attending physician. 

The color of perfect milk is yellowish white, not blue white. 
Its odor is pleasant. A drop of milk poured into a glass of 
fresh water will go to the bottom if it is good milk. In order 
to ascertain if the milk is alkaline, neutral or acid, put a small 
piece of red litmus paper into it, and if it turns strongly blue 
the milk is alkaline. If a blue litmus paper turns strongly red, 
the milk is acid. Perfect milk should be neutral or slightly 
alkaline. After the milk has stood for several hours it grad- 
ually becomes more acid. 

Milk which is acid in reaction, or blue in color, is unfit as a 
food for children and invalids. If a mother is uncertain as to 
the quality of the milk she is feeding her child, she should have 
it examined by the city chemist. 

Milk, even if handled very carefully, contains many germs. 
Therefore, on hot days it is better to sterilize the milk for an 



STUDY OF FOODS. 35 

infant, even if the child is in perfect health, or able to take raw 
milk. If the milk can. be obtained directly from the cow two 
or three times per day, it may be given raw on those occasions. 
If it has stood a little, while, it may be heated quickly to 155 
degrees F. over a hot fire, while stirring it. 

CERTIFIED MILK. 

This is a high grade of sanitary milk which comes from 
special dairies, where great care is taken to keep everything 
in perfect sanitary condition. The cows are kept in perfect 
health and are fed upon food which produces milk perfect in 
composition. There are, however, milkmen who have principle 
enough to supply their customers with milk of good character 
and perhaps of as high a grade as that from inspected dairies. 

I have, in my practice, often come in contact with people who 
were informed by their milkmen that certified milk required no 
boiling or sterilization. Some people are impressed with the 
idea that certified milk has already undergone some sort of 
preparation. The fact that in these days milk laboratories can 
be found in many large cities, may easily bring confusion, of 
mind as to "what the milk is certified for," especially to those 
w ho are not acquainted with the preparation of milk and do not 
know the difference between raw and sterilized milk, if they 
buy it. Such instructions should be given by better "authorities 
than those who deliver milk, or the label should state "what 
the milk is certified for." Certified, or any other raw milk, 
which is over eight hours old, is not a fit food for infants. 

BOILED MILK AND CREAM FOR TABLE USE. 
Put the desired amount of milk or cream, or mixed milk and 
cream, into a clean sauce-pan, stir over a hot fire until it reaches 
the boiling point or to about 200 F. Then pour into a pitcher 
and set in a pan of cold water; stir until the milk is cold. Set 
on ice or in a cold place for 24 hours. Milk prepared in. this 
way is the only wholesome kind to use in addition to boiled 
cereals and fruit puddings. It is also often preferrable to raw 
cream and milk, in combination with raw fruits. If the milk 
is to be used on cereals for the morning meal, it can be reheated 
or used directly after boiling. If hot milk is added to cereals, 
the sugar will not be missed. 



36 STUDY OF FOODS. 

If boiled milk or cream has stood for 24 hours it has become 
unfit for further use unless it is reboiled. If putrefaction has 
set it, boiled milk can become more dangerous as a food than 
raw milk which has stood for the same length of time; there- 
fore careful handling of boiled milk as well as other boiled 
foods is of the utmost importance. (See Chapter on Hygiene 
and Economy, under Left-Overs.) 

In many foreign countries it is a general custom in every 
household to boil milk directly after delivery, for the infant as 
well as for table use. To do differently means uncleanliness. 
Modern invention of coolers and ice-boxes in every house, and 
delivery of milk in bottles, has gradually done away with this 
custom. Many of our present generation of house-wives are 
so little acquainted with practical housekeeping that they con- 
sider food fit for use as long as it has not soured, notwithstand- 
ing the many changes it has undergone on the pantry shelf. 
Raw cream is fit for use only directly after it has left the 
separator. Raw milk should not be considered fresh and whole- 
some for table use longer than eight or ten hours after milking, 
and then only with the most careful handling. Following this 
precaution, morning milk, which is delivered during the day, 
should not be used raw later than five or six o'clock in the 
evening. Remember that all milk begins to turn acid as soon 
as it comes in contact with the air. The longer it stands the 
more acid it will be, besides being laden with germs. The 
process of cooking or scalding raw milk checks the fermenting 
processes and renders the food more alkaline, especially if it is 
to be taken with cereals or fruit puddings and gelatines. 

Cooked milk is not a natural food, but neither are cooked 
cereals. Raw milk is quickly digested, while boiled milk takes 
several hours to digest, and so do boiled cereals. A combina- 
tion of raw milk, or cream, and cooked cereals will force the 
stomach to absorb the milk immediately, while the remainder, 
poorly masticated and filled with germs, will tend to produce 
an acid process rather than an, alkaline. If sugar is added to 
raw milk and cereals, the process of intestinal fermentation is 
complete. If the glandular system and the eliminating organs 
are strong, they will; work harder in order to rid the system of 
this excess of acid ; but if the constitution is not able to stand 



STUDY OF FOODS. 37 

the strain of wasteful nervous expenditure, discomfort and 
disease will be the result ! Enlarged tonsils are often- the first 
sign of danger. We cannot invent customs of feeding that 
interfere with natural laws without paying the penalty. 



MISCELLANEOUS FOODS. 

FATS. 

Fats are derived from the animal and vegetable kingdom; 
they are rich in carbon and hydrogen, but poor in oxygen. 
Emulsified fats are present in cream, nuts and the yolks of 
eggs. Oleins are mainly found in oils obtained from fruits, 
nuts and vegetables. Butter contains mainly palmitin. Suet, 
from beef and mutton, consists of stearin and palmitin. Leci- 
thin is -found in yolks of eggs and in. some nuts ; it is a highly 
complex compound, and a food for the brain and nerve sub- 
stance. Suet and mutton fat contain much stearin, and are 
harder to digest by some people than other fats. However, the 
digestibility of a food depends much upon the individual re- 
quirements, and a little self study will soon convince each 
what forms of fat are best suited to his needs. As a rule, peo- 
ple of large bone structures require a greater amount of fat in 
their food than those not so constructed. 

Fats are changed into fatty acids and glycerine by the secre- 
tion of the bile and pancreatic juice, and in combination with 
the intestinal juices form soluble soaps. In acute d:'seases fats 
should be taken only in the form of butter, milk, or cream, in 
limited quantities. Fatty foods are beneficial for children suf- 
fering with scrofula or rickets, and in all chronic, wasting dis- 
eases. 

People who do much indoor work, or those who are not able 
to digest a sufficient amount of protein or cereals, require more 
fats. The latter can be made easily digestible if rightly com- 
bined and prepared in the form of soups, warm sauces, boiled 
custards and mayonnaise dressing. In this way the fat globules 
are equally divided in the food and can be better emulsified than 
if eaten in the solid form, or in combination with white bread 
or other unsuitable articles. Cream, and the lighter nuts, com- 



38 STUDY OF FOODS. 

bine well with sweet foods, while oils, yolks of eggs, meat fats, 
and solid fats, combine well with foods which are rich in min- 
erals and oxygen. 

People who are unable to furnish their table with expensive 
fats, such as butter, olives, cream, olive oil, bacon, eggs, eel 
and other delicacies, should use the cheaper forms of fats, as 
corn, oats, herring, walnuts, cream-cheese, cottonseed oil, bran., 
leaf lard, vegetable butter, middle rib of beef, blood and liver 
sausages. Meat products, prepared from the internal organs of 
the animal, are rich in lime and fat, and, if prepared from fresh 
meats of healthy animals, they are often preferable to canned 
and cold storage products, or to meat which hangs in a meat- 
shop for a week. However, every one who buys these articles 
should investigate the source and manner of preparation for 
himself. 

SUGAR. 

Artificial sugar is not a necessary article of food for the 
healthy individual who is able to supply his body with fresh 
arid dried fruits the year round. 

True candies are : figs, dates, raisins and other tropical fruits. 
The delicious summer fruits are better eaten without sugar. 
Undoubtedly nature did not mean for us to indulge in sweets 
during hot days, or she would have provided us more plenti- 
fully with them. All the spring fruits are tart; people who 
wish to improve the taste of berries add sugar to them at the 
expense of health. Our forefathers, who did not enjoy such 
luxuries, had better health than our present generation. The 
sugar-cane in its natural state is a valuable food. It contains 
gluten and minerals, such as are found in other vegetables, and 
if eaten in this form it is more wholesome than refined sugar. 
The gluten and minerals are destroyed by chemical processes 
which are necessary to pro'duce sugar from the cane and beet. 
Pure, crystalized sugar cannot sustain life, unless it is eaten 
in the proper proportion, with foods which contain gluten, min- 
erals and fats. 

Sugar which contains minerals cannot crystalize ; it remains 
syrup, therefore the latter is more wholesome than sugar. In 
order to produce beets, which are richer in sugar and poorer in 



STUDY .OF FOODS. 39 

salts, certain methods of manuring are employed. The profit 
gained by this method is a financial one. The consumer is 
the loser. 

If artificial sugar is united with cocoa or other bitter, sour, 
nutritious substances it will serve as a food; therefore, sugar 
in the form of a prepared food such as chocolate, gelatine and 
gruels is wholesome for those who require cooked foods. If 
the sugar industry were diminished, the canning and stewing 
of fruits would also be diminished, and we would have fewer 
tea and coffee drunkards. All this gluttony in stimulating bev- 
erages and sweet fruit sauces was not indulged in by the masses 
a hundred years ago, therefore the constitution of the average 
individual at that time was much stronger. 

Many parents are impressed with the idea that their children 
require a large amount of sweets, in order to make them grow. 
We cannot force nature without paying the penalty. At ma- 
turity, we reap what has been sown for us, or what we have 
sown for ourselves. 

SPICES. 

Spices are a species of aromatr'c vegetables and fruits used 
for the seasoning and preservation of foods. Their flavor is 
pleasant and stimulating to the mucous membrane of the 
mouth. 

The odoriferous substances yielded from these plants are: 
the volatile oils and ethers of peppermint, roses, orange flower, 
lavender, camphor, lemon, bitter almond, wintergreen, cinna- 
mon, cloves and a number of others. They are used for per- 
fumes, medicines, confections, and in the art of cookery. Many 
of the spices used for food are dried, as bay leaves, thyme, 
marjoram, vanilla beans, dried skins of lemons and oranges. 
Ground spices or liquid extracts should be used sparingly. 
Many of them are adulterated. Free salt and ground spices 
create an abnormal desire for water and food, and they injure 
the mucous membrane lining of the blood vessels and glandular 
structures, and obstruct the capillaries. 

People who cannot relish their food without these artificial 
appetizers should fast a while, or replace them by natural stim- 
ulants, as tomatoes, apples, lemons and greens. Few people 



40 STUDY OF FOODS. 

realize the harm that is done by the number of salt, sugar and 
pepper holders that are placed on the table at every meal, to 
say nothing of the dozens of boxes of ground spices that fill 
the kitchen shelf. A pinch of pepper on gravies, milk soups, or 
other nutritious dishes, if mixed thoroughly with the food, 
assists in the coagulation of soft nitrogenous foods and prevents 
putrefaction, but excess of it, or if sprinkled on dry food, is very 
harmful. 

The best way to use spices is to buy them whole, in the fresh 
or dried state, and chop, grate, or grind them when needed. 
Vanilla beans, bitter almonds, bay leaves, cinnamon bark and 
many others may- be used whole and removed before serving. 

Children's food should never be covered with pepper or other 
stimulating spices. Under our present system of living salt has 
become a necessary adjunct to our food. Legumes, cereals or 
any other foods which require a large amount of water for cook- 
ing need an additional amount of salt. It should be added be- 
fore the food is removed from the fire, so that the salt will be 
properly dissolved and combined with the food. Moderate 
amounts of preserved, salted meats and fish are valuable as 
antiseptics, if combined with soft, cooked, nutritious foods in 
the form of soups and gravies, or with milk foods, eggs, cereals 
or legumes. Salt used in this way will not hurt the lining of 
the alimentary tract and other tissues, as free salt does when 
it is sprinkled on lettuce, meat, potatoes or other dry food. 
Never use salted, smoked or preserved meats or fish in excess. 
If possible, investigate the source and manner of preparation of 
preserved foods. 

DESSERTS. 

Desserts have only been mentioned in the form of steamed 
puddings, gelatines, oranges, grapes or bread and butter in 
combination with black unsweetened coffee. Artificially pre- 
pared desserts in the form of attractive, soft puddings and 
other rich mixtures flatter the palate and renew the appetite. 
The .true enjoyment of eating is in the satisfaction of hunger. 
The craving for desserts indicates a desire to stimulate certain 
nerves, which force the contents of the stomach into the intes- 
tine and destroy the digestive processes or produce decomposi- 



STUDY OF FOODS. 41 

tion, hasten absorption, and exhilarate the brain with the 
toxins hereby produced. 

Those who desire to correct the habits of intoxication in 
themselves or in others should consider whether the abnormal 
craving is for merely physical pleasure or for the satisfaction 
of starved and overworked brains and bodies, and the change 
should be brought about accordingly. To drop a long acquired 
habit at once may prove harmless to one person and very fatal 
to another. 

The worn-out digestive organs need to be toned up and de- 
veloped gradually, either by stimulating fruits or fruit juices 
or by tonics in the form of bran-tea and malt-coffee. 

People who have vigorous appetites and strong digestive 
organs may eat a few nuts at the end of the meal until the 
appetite has been restored to normal. For those who like 
sweets, a large number of recipes have been given for fruit 
salads and light cooked dishes. Many can be served as whole 
meals for the evening, or in combination with milk broths or 
soups. 

MUFFINS AND PANCAKES. 

Many people who find pancakes indigestible will do well 
to observe the time when they are most agreeable. If they are 
made with eggs, cream, and water, or with rich milk, and prop- 
erly prepared and combined with suitable articles, they are 
generally agreeable to the most sensitive stomach. 

People of sedentary habits, or those who do brain work 
mainly, should not eat pancakes or muffins for breakfast. 

All ingredients, as well as the vessel, should be cold. The 
batter should also be made in a cold place or out of doors. 
The oven, the baking pans and the oil in which the cakes are 
baked, should be as hot as possible. 

BREAD. 

Bread made from white flour and yeast is the staff of death. 
Few people realize that if they wish to use white bread as a 
food the proper amount of minerals, fats and nitrogen must 
be added, in order to make it a perfect food. Yeast bread, if 
eaten with jams and jellies in large quantities between meals, 



42 STUDY OF FOODS. 

is health destroying and dwarfs the body. It is also unwise to 
eat white bread in combination with other starches, as rice, 
potatoes and soft puddings. The average individual who takes 
plenty of out-door exercise may get along well for years on 
such mixtures and suffer no inconvenience, but people with 
poor eliminating organs or chronic ailments, or those who do 
much indoor work, do well to use yeast bread in moderation, 
especially if prepared from white flour. 

Baked and boiled cereals are more nutritious than bread. In 
the fermenting process which takes place in rising bread, val- 
t'able substances such as lime and salts are lost. It is rendered 
more acid, and therefore unfit as a food for people with weak 
stomachs. If yeast bread is combined with foods which render 
the fluids of the stomach alkaline, it is less harmful. 

SOUPS. 

Many American housekeepers do not know how to prepare 
soups and do not like them. The fact that people of many 
nations in the old world, with smaller incomes than the average 
American working man, use soups daily, once or twice, and 
are far superior in physical strength and endurance to the 
latter, who lives mainly on beefsteak, white bread, potatoes, 
sugar, tea and coffee, should convince every one that nutritious 
soups are an important article of diet. Close study and per- 
sistent effort will enable every homekeeper with small means 
to learn how to prepare a soup that is palatable and nutritious. 
The daily use of white bread and butter is expensive. Besides 
it produces diseases, imperfect bodies and premature old age. 

All who are in the habit of eating more than their systems 
require and especially those who indulge in large amounts of 
bread at dinner, would do well to begin their meal with a soup. 
Legume and cream soups will furnish a satisfactory meal by 
themselves. For combinations see "Menus."

CHAPTER I. 

GREEN VEGETABLES. 

Green vegetables furnish a large amount of easily digested 
carbohydrates and contain much mineral matter in which meats 
and cereals are deficient. That they add to the highest purity 
of our blood has been proven by the fact that many blood and 
skin diseases have been cured by the application of specific 
greens alone. However, no matter how valuable an. article is, 
it should be used according to the needs of the individual. As 
vegetables also contain a large amount of water, it is not wise 
for one who has to perform active mental or physical labor 
to indulge in a large amount of cooked, especially under- 
ground, vegetables at the noon meal. At this time of the day 
the system requires the most nutritious foods in the form of 
proteid elements, no matter whether the meal consists of 
cooked food, cold or warmed over. Green peas and corn are 
best eaten at the noon meal, as they are rich in proteid ele- 
ments. Asparagus, tomatoes, string beans and leaf greens are 



44 VEGETABLES. 

also suitable at this time of the day, provided some nutritious 
food of the proteid class is served with them. For further com- 
binations, see "Left Overs" and Menus. 

The blanching of vegetables, as advised by some authorities, 
will always remove valuable constituents of the plant. The 
blanching and ventilation, of vegetables during the process of 
cooking is advised, in order to make them more wholesome. 
All artificially prepared foods will lose certain constituents 
through the process of cooking, and this loss is generally made 
up by additional flavoring or sauces. Vegetables which are 
cooked in very little water and kept well covered (not venti- 
lated), will love less of their natural qualities, and the inju- 
rious gases which do not escape by this process can be made 
harmless through the addition of fats, in the emulsified form, 
as sauces, the yolk of an egg, lemon or cream. 

In the consumption of food, as well as the custom of dress 
and education, some people have reached that stage of refine- 
ment where degeneration begins. We cannot refine natural 
food without paying the penalty for it, which means the pro- 
ducing of disease and the shortening of life. The excessive use 
of refined sugar, alcohol and other artificial stimulants, has 
produced a dislike for fatty foods by many people, so that 
they refuse to eat sauces, or fat meats in any form, the only fat 
they use being butter. While the latter is a valuable food, it 
often cannot be assimilated by the system if spread on white 
bread, or mixed with cooked vegetables ; it generally serves 
only as a lubricant. If butter is eaten in excess, especially in 
the summer, it clogs the system. Some people prepare vege- 
tables and soups with melted butter for the sake of convenience. 
This is a waste, since a tablespoonful of butter or other fat 
properly emulsified as directed under butter sauces will often 
.give more nutriment than one-quarter of a pound of butter 
wasted by soaking into toast or other cooked foods. 

The American method of cooking green vegetables in a 
large amount of water and throwing it away, then seasoning 
them with butter and spices and serving them with lean meat 
and white bread, produces a starvation diet. In such a meal, 
the important mineral matter and the fats in vegetables and 
whole wheat grains are left out, and are supplemented by an 



VEGETABLES. 45 

excess of starches and water in the form of bread, beverages 
and desserts. Additional fats should be added scientifically 
and combined with foods which are rich in minerals and acids. 

All vegetable water, especially that of canned or sterilized 
fruits and vegetables, is very wholesome and antiseptic. 
Strained, sterilized tomato, currant, gooseberry and strawberry 
juices are unsurpassed as a liver medicine in some conditions. 
These same foods will lose their medicinal value if stewed 
in an open kettle. They should be prepared in Mason jars or 
cans. After opening, these fruit juices may be kept in earthen- 
ware on. ice for twelve hours, and served again. After this they 
should be reboiled or sterilized, in order to check fermentation. 
For the sick, the same precaution should be taken with keeping 
fruit juices as with milk. 

When using canned vegetables, never throw away the 
water, if it is not to be used for dressing. Add it to soups or 
t;se it in place of beverages. Pea, bean and asparagus water 
may be made very palatable if cream is added. See prepara- 
tion of legume teas under "Fluids." 

In. preparing vegetables for the sick, the finest of all dress- 
ings is the yolk of an egg and lemon juice, with a small amount 
of butter. The fat in the yolk of the egg being emulsified in 
a perfectly natural state, it feeds the mucous membrane of the 
entire alimentary tract and blood vessels. Besides neutralizing 
the gas producing tendencies of the foods, it aids in, the diges- 
tive and assimilating processes and feeds the nerve sheaths. 
In all chronic conditions, which are the result of hardening of 
the arteries, a large amount of the yolk of eggs, combined 
with lemon and oil, may be used. There are a few vegetables 
which do not combine well with the yolk of an egg, such as 
turnips, carrots, beets and onions. These contain a large 
amount of sulphur and iron, which is also found in the yolk o-f 
the egg. Fat meats are good additions to the last mentioned 
vegetables, except onions, which are rich in oil themselves. If 
underground vegetables are served in the form of purees, they 
should be mashed very fine or rubbed through a colander ; the 
butter which is added should not be allowed to boil. Peas, 
beans, cauliflower and cabbage are most likely to disagree if 



46 VEGETABLES. 

served with butter only. Butter sauces, cream sauces, yolks 
of eggs and lemon are the best additions to make them agree- 
able. 

Some people prefer vegetables cooked in oil. Those whose 
systems can digest a large amount of fat will find them agree- 
able. 

ARTICHOKES. 

Wash them thoroughly and remove the outside leaves. Drop 
into salted boiling water and cook for 20 or 30 minutes. Add 
a few drops of vinegar to the water while boiling. Serve warm 
with a white sauce or let cool and serve with French or mayon- 
naise dressing. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Wash and cut them into inch pieces until the hard part of 
the stem is reached. Boil them for 20 minutes, or until tender. 
Serve warm with butter, milk, cream, or egg sauce, or cold 
with French or mayonnaise dressing. The asparagus may be 
scraped and tied into bundles when boiling. 

BEETS. 

Remove the green tops and wash them carefully. Do not 
prick the skin, as the juice will then escape and injure the 
color as well as the flavor. Young beets will be tender in about 
one hour, older ones take two to three hours. When done, 
peel and slice. Serve with a butter or cream sauce, or plain, 
with butter and chopped parsley. For salad, cut into slices 
and pour over them boiling vinegar, diluted with one-half 
water. Add whole spices if desired. 

MASHED BEETS. 

Prepare like the above. When tender, peel and mash very 
fine with a potato masher, and add butter and a few drops of 
lemon juice. 

BEET GREENS. 

Wash the tops and boil in a very little water until tender. 
A small piece of salted or smoked lean meat may be boiled 
with them to give them a better flavor. Chop fine and -flavor 



VEGETABLES. 47 

with butter and lemon juice. A brown butter sauce may be 
prepared from the water in which the greens have been boiled ; 
when done mix with the finely chopped greens, and let it boil 
a second, and flavor with lemon. 

ROASTED CARROTS. 

Wash, scrape, and cut them lengthwise into halfs and quar- 
ters, then cut crosswise into inch pieces or smaller. Cover with 
boiling water and cook for 10 or 15 minutes, with a little salt. 
Drain off the water (add to soups) ; brown some fat and flour, 
add to it soup stock, whey or the water which was drained off, 
and roast the carrots in it until done. Cover them tightly and 
add more fluid while roasting, if necessary. Flavor with 
chopped parsley. 

CARROT PUREE. No. i. 

Steam or cook the carrots with salt and as little water as 
possible. A small piece of lean bacon or cornbeef may be 
added for flavoring. When done, mash very fine with a potato 
masher. Flavor with butter and a little pepper and parsley or 
lemon. 

CARROT PUREE. No. 2. 

Prepare like the above, and add one potato to three medium- 
sized carrots. If the potatoes require less time to cook, add 
them when the carrots are half done. This preparation may 
be especially recommended for chronic invalids or for those 
who have a dislike for the sweet flavor of the vegetable. 

CREAMED CARROTS. No. i. 

Cook like carrot puree. When tender, make a butter sauce 
with the water; add parsley and hot cream, if desired. 

CREAMED CARROTS. No. 2. 

Cook like number one, thicken with flour or corn starch, 
and add some hot cream and parsley. Serve, like soup or 
vegetables, for breakfast or supper, with dry whole wheat or 
black bread. Butter is not required at the meal if cream is 
used. If the butter and cream are emulsified as in sauces, they 
are more wholesome. 



4S VEGETABLES. 

PEAS. 

Wash the peas while in the pods, then shell. Boil the pods 
in a very little water for 15 minutes, then take out and put the 
peas to boil in the same water. Add a little salt and sugar 
when almost done. Prepare further like creamed carrots. 
Some people prefer them with no dressing except butter. 
Those who have difficulty in digesting starch and wish to cut 
out the bread at the meal may use sauces or cream dressings 
with their vegetables, especially in the winter. 

MIXED PEAS AND CARROTS. 

Put the peas on to boil, and when half done, add an equal 
amount of carrots which have been cut into half inch pieces. 
Prepare with a butter sauce like creamed carrots, and add 
chopped parsley. This will afford a perfect meal for dinner in 
spring or summer. A few bread or flour dumplings may be 
served with it. The latter should be cooked with the peas 10 
minutes before serving. Salted or smoked meats give them a 
good flavor. 

PEAS AND CODFISH (Saxon Dish). 

Cook the peas with a very little water, and add meat broth 
while they are boiling. Boil some fresh codfish in a separate 
saucepan, and when done remove the skin and bones, cut into 
pieces and mix with the peas. Prepare a butter sauce from 
the liquid remaining on the peas. Carrots may be added. 

PEAS WITH LAMB. 

Boil the lamb with sufficient water to cover it. Add salt and 
onion. When half done, put it to boil with the peas, which 
should have been boiled with water in, another saucepan for 
10 minutes. When meat and peas are done, remove the fat, 
thicken with flour and add the pea water to make a butter 
sauce. Flavor with parsley. Use the meat broth for soup or 
add the yolk of an egg or two, and serve in cups. 

MIXED VEGETABLES (Leipsiger Dish). 

Use asparagus tops, young French carrots, peas, and cauli- 
flower. Cook each vegetable separately with salt, in as little 



VEGETABLES. 49 

water as possible. When done, drain the water from each and 
use for soup. Mix the different vegetables in one dish and 
pour browned butter over them. Serve with Lobster Curry. 
A butter sauce may be prepared from the vegetable water in 
place of brown butter. Bread or flour dumplings may be 
served with it. Lean meat is also a good combination. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

Cauliflower should be avoided by those who have delicate 
stomachs, at the evening meal. It should be perfectly fresh 
and put into salted water tor an hour before cooking, in order 
to take out any hidden insects. It should be boiled 20 to 30 
minutes; if steamed it takes a little longer. Flavor with salt 
and a little sugar while boiling. Serve with brown or melted 
butter and lemon, or prepare a butter sauce with soup stock 
and the yolk of an egg, or with cream. Season with pepper. 
Serve with chipped beef or grated cheese for breakfast, or 
with lean meat for dinner. Left over cauliflower may be baked 
in the oven with cheese or bread crumbs, and served for break- 
fast. Tomato sauce is also suitable as -a dressing. Cold cheese 
is a better combination, with the latter than cream sauce or 
baked cheese. 

STRING BEANS: 

They are very purifying and should be eaten often, by peo- 
ple of a bilious tendency. Select young string beans, pull off 
the string on each side and break in pieces an inch long. Boil 
in slightly salted water and prepare like green peas. They 
may be mixed with carrots. Ribs of beef or lamb can be 
cooked with them as described in recipe for peas. For other 
combinations, see "Boiled Mixed Dinners." 

SPINACH. 

This is also a very valuable vegetable. Besides being rich 
in iron and phosphates, it is laxative, and excellent as a medici- 
nal food for constipation. Wash it thoroughly. For a delicate 
stomach use the leaves only. Steep in as little water as possi- 
ble, chop very fine or rub through a colander; season with 
pepper, salt, lemon and butter, or prepare with a brown or 



5 o VEGETABLES. 

white butter sauce from soup stock, or spinach water. Gelatine 
may be used in place of soup stock by dissolving the gelatine 
in the vegetable water. Smoked or salted lean meat may be 
cooked with it for flavoring. Serve with eggs or lean meat. 

SPINACH (Saxon Dish). 

Boil in as little water as possible, and chop fine. Then chop 
fine some well watered salt herring or other salt fish. Prepare the 
spinach with a butter sauce made from soup stock, add the 
fish and serve on toast. Dried bread crumbs or browned flour 
mixed with butter, without the liquid, may be added to any of 
the green leaf vegetables. 

MUSTARD GREENS. 

Dandelions, yellow dock, horse radish tops and lettuce may 
be prepared in the same manner as spinach. 

OKRA. 

Wash and remove the stems. Boil in salted water for 40 or 
50 minutes. Prepare with a butter or cream sauce. 

STEWED CUCUMBERS. 

Wash and peel them. Then, cut into pieces and cook with as 
little water as possible, until tender. Serve with fish or lean 
meat for dinner, or with whole wheat or rye bread for break- 

fast CELERY ROOT. 

Wash and boil the roots with the skins. When tender, peel 
them and cut into slices. Prepare with a butter sauce made 
with soup stock or serve with French dressing. Flavor with 
parsley. BLACK CARROTS. 

Wash and scrape. Boil in salt water to which a little vine- 
gar has been added. Prepare with a butter sauce, or mash 
fine. Serve with tongue, croquettes or boiled beef. 

EGG PLANT. 

Cut in slices about an inch thick. Make a batter of eggs, 
salt and flour; dip the slices of egg plant in the batter, and fry 
in hot fat. Serve with lean meat, for dinner or supper, or serve 
with green salad for breakfast. 



VEGETABLES. 51 

STUFFED GREEN PEPPERS. 

Cut off the stem end and remove the seeds. Fill the peppers 
with a dressing such as is given, in recipes for bread dump- 
lings or meat croquettes. Place them in a baking dish with 
two tablespoonfuls of oil or fat ; when brown add a little flour 
and some soup stock, cover the dish and bake in an oven for 
about 50 minutes. The inner part of the peppers may be 
mixed with the rilling. 

ONIONS. 

For stewing use small or medium sized onions. Boil them 
in salt water, drain off the water and serve with butter and 
lemon, or prepare a butter or cream sauce. They are best eaten 
for breakfast or dinner with some salted meat, and wheat or 



RAW ONIONS. 
People who like onions and find they disagree on account 
of the strong acids, should grate them and mix thoroughly with 
sauces, or French or mayonnaise dressing. 

FRIED ONIONS. 

Chop the onions very fine in a wooden bowl. Then heat some 
butter and oil and fry them until light brown and pour over 
steak or mix with potatoes. 

PARSLEY. 

Chop enough to last for several days. Melt some butter and 
add the parsley, and let boil up once. When cold put on ice. 
This saves time, though it is best to prepare the parsley fresh 
for each meal. 

MUSHROOMS. 

Wash and dry them, then roll in flour and fry in fat until 
brown. Add some soup stock and steep until done. Cover 
well. If the stock is too thin, add a little browned flour; season 
and serve on toast. 

RED CABBAGE. 

Wash and cut in quarters. Mince very fine and put on to 
boil in a little water ; let it cook for 20 minutes in earthen ware. 
then add three to five ounces of fat or oil, some vinegar, sugar, 
salt and caraway seed. Let all cook for several hours. A few 



52 VEGETABLES. 

apples may be cooked with the cabbage and taken out when 
done. The latter may be served for breakfast. When the 
cabbage is done, thicken with browned flour and let cook 10 
minutes longer. Onion may be added if desired. A piece of 
salt pork is also a good addition in place of oil. 

WHITE CABBAGE. No. i. 
Prepare the same as red cabbage. 

WHITE CABBAGE. No. 2. 

Cut in quarters and boil in a little water with a small piece 
of lean salted smoked meat, or without meat. When tender, 
drain and serve with butter and the yolk of an egg and lemon, 
or with an egg sauce or tomato sauce. 

SPROUTS. 

Remove the outside leaves and put to boil in a little salt 
water. When tender, drain and season with butter and lemon. 
The yolk of an egg may be added. A butter or egg sauce is 
also good. 

COOKED CORN. 

Remove the leaves and put in cold salt water for 30 minutes. 
Then, boil for 20 minutes. Corn is best when eaten raw. It is 
very nutritious and will afford a perfect meal during the sum- 
mer with tomato salad and lettuce. 

CANNED CORN. 

Thicken the corn with flour and water. Add a small amount 
of hot cream and season with salt and pepper or a few spoon- 
fuls of tomato juice. If no cream is desired, drain off the 
liquid and thicken like butter sauce. Canned corn., being a rich 
and soft food, should not be mixed with many other -foods at 
the same meal. It is more suitable for the morning or noon 
meal than for supper. 

KOHLRABI. 

Peel, slice thin, and stew in a very little water. When nearly 
done, add some hot soup. Prepare with a butter sauce. Chop 
fine some green leaves of the plant previously boiled and add. 
Serve with boiled beef. 



VEGETABLES. 53 

VEGETABLE OYSTER. 

Wash, scrape and boil in salt water until tender about 40 
minutes. Prepare with butter, milk or cream sauce, or mash 
fine and fry like potato balls. Season with lemon or pepper. 

TURNIP PUREE. 

Prepare like carrot puree. Cook with as little water as pos- 
sible. ROASTED TURNIPS. 

Prepare the same as roasted carrots. They combine well 
with mutton. FRIED PARSNIPS. 

Scrape, wash and cut in slices, lengthwise. Boil in salt 
water for 5 minutes, then drain and fry in smoking hot fat. 
They can be turned in batter if desired. They may be fried 
without cooking, like sweet potatoes. 

KALE. 

This is a desirable vegetable in cold weather. It is purifying 
and very valuable during the rainy season, in malarial districts. 
Remove the leaves from the stems, wash and boil in salt water, 
using as little water as possible. Chop very fine and prepare 
like spinach. A little smoked meat may be added. 

SQUASH. 

If young and tender it does not require peeling. Wash, cut 
into small pieces and steam. When done, mash fine and season 
with salt, pepper and cream, or butter, and a few drops of 
lemon. It may be cut in. slices and fried in oil, or dipped in 
butter and fried like egg plant. 

TOMATO PUREE. 

Cut some fresh, firm tomatoes into several pieces. Cook in 
a double boiler with as little water as possible. Rub through 
a sieve with a spoon or potato masher. From 3 to 6 ounces of 
thick puree is sufficient at a meal, for the average adult. For 
medicinal purposes, tomatoes may be eaten in large quantities. 

CANNED STEWED TOMATOES. No. i. 
They are more wholesome if not cooked. Place a can of 
tomatoes in hot water to heat, drain, off the liquid, and serve 
with meat, fish, eggs or cheese. The liquid may be kept, for 
soup. 



54 VEGETABLES. 

STEWED TOMATOES. No. 2. 

Heat a can of tomatoes, thicken with flour and water, and 
let boil 10 minutes. Add some butter and flavor with onion, 
and small amount of sugar if desired. 

STEWED TOMATOES. No. 3. 

Prepare as number two, thicken with bread or cracker 
crumbs, instead of flour. 

STEWED TOMATOES. No. 4. 

Heat a can of tomatoes. Then heat some butter and oil in 
a flat saucepan, thicken with mixed flour, flavor with onion, add 
the tomatoes gradually, and let boil a few minutes. 

STUFFED TOMATOES. 

Wash the tomatoes and cut off the upper part with a sharp 
knife. Scrape out the pulp and fill the tomatoes with cold 
chopped meat mixed with onion and mayonnaise dressing. Gar- 
nish with lettuce and serve with bread and butter, or as an en- 
tree. 

SAUERKRAUT. 

Wash the sauerkraut in cold water several times. People 
with sensitive stomachs should boil it -for a short time. Then 
drain off the water and put on to boil again. If no meat is 
served with it, use a few tablespoons of oil, lard, butter, or 
goose fat. Add onions and a little sugar or some apples for 
flavoring. Cook from one to two hours. Then add a little 
flour dissolved in cold water, or two raw grated potatoes. Re- 
move the apples before serving. The latter may be eaten for 
breakfast or supper. If the onions disagree, remove them be- 
fore serving. Good combinations with sauerkraut are : Pea 
puree, pork, bacon, liver, liver-pudding, white fish, and oysters 
stewed or fried. 

CABBAGE ROLLS. 

Wash some large cabbage leaves. Fill them with finely 
chopped left-over meat, mixed with eggs. (See recipe for 
croquettes.) Then tie the rolls together with a string. Steam 
in a shallow dish with as little water as possible. Serve with 
an egg sauce. Flavor with mace.

POTATOES. 

Potatoes consist mainly of starch and water. They are more 
expensive than wheat, rye, oats, barley and corn. They should 
not be eaten oftener than- once a day, or better three times a 
week. People who do hard physical or mental work should 
not eat potatoes at the noon meal. Fat meats, eggs, fish and 
greens combine well with potatoes ; if they are served with 
lean meat, some fatty substance in the form of butter, cream 
or gravy should be eaten with them. Fried potatoes are not 
wholesome. The best way to prepare them is to boil or bake 
them in the skins, or boil or mash them in cream or butter- 
milk. 

POTATO SALAD. 

Boil or steam some potatoes with their jackets on.. When 
done, peel and slice them into a deep bowl while warm ; then 
sprinkle over them a little salt, pepper, and finely chopped or 
grated onion, and pour over them some boiling hot vinegar 
diluted with one-half water and mixed with melted butter or 
oil. Cover with a saucer and shake well; let stand for twenty 
or thirty minutes. If there is too much liquid, pour off some 
and mix the remainder with mayonnaise dressing and chopped 
parsley, if desired. 

SWEET POTATOES. 

Boil the potatoes in the jackets, let cool, peel, slice, and fry 
in one-half butter and one-half oil. Serve with cranberry sauce, 
lettuce, and lean meat. 

Sweet potatoes may be peeled and sliced in the raw state, 
and fried in half oil and half butter. Serve as above. They are 
very suitable for breakfast. 

CREAMED POTATOES. 

Select small potatoes and boil in the skins. Add some salt. 
When done, peel and cut into thin slices. Bring some milk 
to a boil, and thicken with corn starch dissolved in water, or 
prepare a butter sauce with butter, flour and milk. Add the 
potatoes and some finely chopped parsley. Serve with fish or 
salted preserved meat. 



56 VEGETABLES. 

CRUST POTATOES. 

Use small, imported German potatoes. Boil with the skins, 
peel and turn in yolk of eggs and rye nuts ; fry in oil and butter. 
Serve with sprouts, or spinach and meat. 

STEAMED POTATOES. 

Peel small sized potatoes, wash and put into a steamer or 
colander. When done pour into a dish, and mix with chopped 
parsley and fresh butter. Serve with fish. 

FRENCH FRIED POTATOES. 

Peel and cut into long strips or thin slices. Put into salt 
water on ice for half an hour. Fry in boiling oil. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Peel, wash, and boil or steam the potatoes ; when done, mash 
fine, and add some hot cream or cold butter-milk, and a little 
salt, also a piece of butter. 

MASHED SWEET POTATOES. 
Prepare the same as white potatoes. 

POTATO BALLS. 

Beat 2 eggs with an egg beater, mix with one cup of left- 
over mashed potatoes, shape into balls and fry in hot fat. Serve 
with bacon, fish, or sausage, for breakfast. 

POTATO PUDDING. 

Prepare the same as potato balls. Put the mass into a pud- 
ding dish and cover with rye nuts, grated cheese, or a beaten 
egg mixed with rye nuts, and bake half an hour. 

POTATO AND APPLE PUREE. 

Prepare as for mashed potatoes. Use apple sauce in place of 
li'ilk or cream, mix well and add a liberal piece of butter. 
Serve with sauer roast, veal cutlets or sausage. It is good 
for breakfast with bacon. 



CHAPTER II. 

LEGUMES AND MEATS. 

BAKED BEANS. 

Pick over the beans carefully, wash and soak them in soft 
water as directed in chapter on legumes. If the beans are to be 
cooked with fat, scald or parboil the meat first, add it to the 
beans after they have cooked for about an hour. If the beans 
require long cooking, take the meat out when it is tender. 
When the beans are tender, pour them into a bean-pot or 
round pan, cover the top with part of the fat meat cut into 
slices, or pour some cooking oil over the beans, and add a few 
whole onions. Bake for about an hour. Onions and fat meat 
eaten at the same meal are liable to disagree, therefore serve 
the onions at another time, or use them only for flavoring pur- 
poses. 

BAKED LENTILS OR PEAS. 

Prepare in the same manner as baked beans. They require 
less fat for cooking, and are more palatable if served without 
neat than are beans. Onions are rich in oil, therefore if 
plenty of onions are used, the meat is not missed so much. 
In cooking legumes, it is best not to add the salt until they are 
nearly done, because the salt hardens the water. If legumes 
are preferred cooked instead of baked, it is better to add a 
thickening of flour and butter before serving, otherwise they 
may produce flatulent dyspepsia. 

Legumes lose their natural flavor and stimulus in the drying 
and soaking process, therefore they are not palatable or easy 
to digest without some form of fat and appetizing raw salad, 
v/hich supplies the needed stimulant. Many people add sweets 
to legumes or make them more indigestible by adding ground 
nuts and other rich foods to them, as in many vegetarian 
dishes. Such foods are a dangerous burden to a weak stomach 



58 LEGUMES AND MEATS. 

and liver. Heavy protein foods require an acid medium for 
proper digestion and utilization. If legumes are used in the 
form of soups and purees, nothing should be added but a little 
flour, dry toast, fats, or raw vegetables. If we wish to be 
strict vegetarians we must live upon raw foods. If we wish 
to live on cooked foods, a moderate amount of meat is neces- 
sary for most people. 

LIMA BEANS. No. i. 

Soak some lima beans in soft water. Cook in a small amount 
of water with a little salt. When tender, dissolve some corn- 
starch with cold water and add to the beans ; boil for 10 min- 
v.tes, then add a few tablespoonsful of hot cream and remove 
from the fire. Flavor with chopped parsley, if desired. Serve 
with frankfurter or other lean, smoked meats. Mashed or raw 
carrots are also a good addition. 

LIMA BEANS. No. 2. 

Prepare like the foregoing. Drain off the water and add 
a piece of butter, the yolk of an egg, a little lemon juice and 
parsley, if desired. 

LIMA BEANS. No. 3. 

Prepare like the foregoing. Drain off the water and prepare 
a butter-sauce, mix with beans and serve plain, or add the yolk 
oi an egg, a little lemon, and parsley. 

PEA PUREE. 

Soak % CU P f dried green peas in soft water. Boil with I 
quart of water and I onion for about an hour. Bake in a bean- 
pot for i]/ 2 hours or longer; add more water if necessary. 
Keep the peas covered. When done run through a colander 
and add I teaspoonful of butter. This makes about ^4 of a 
cup of puree. One-third of this portion is sufficient for a sick 
person or a young child. Serve on toast, or with raw carrots, 
or cold fat meat. 

BEAN AND LENTIL PUREE. 

Prepare and serve like the foregoing. A small veal or mut- 
ton bone may be boiled with it. The puree must not be greasy. 



MEATS. 59 

SOUR ROAST. 

Let a quart or less of vinegar come to a boil, dilute it with 
one-half the amount of boiling water, add some bay leaves, 
cloves, whole pepper, onions, or any other flavoring, and pour 
over a piece of beef (rump piece) which has been slightly 
rubbed with salt. Let it stand for several days. Then take 
it out of the liquid, cover with bacon or suet, and put into hot 
fat. After it has roasted for a while, stir a large tablespoonful 
of flour into the fat, add some water, and the spiced herbs. 
Cover well, and let it roast two or three hours. Add water or 
buttermilk to the gravy, if desired. Serve with potato dump- 
lings, lettuce and stewed prunes. 

VEAL CUTLETS. 

Sprinkle some lemon juice over the chops, then beat up sev- 
eral yolks of eggs,, turn the chops in them, dip in rye nuts and 
fry in hot fat for ten minutes. Serve with lettuce and toma- 
toes, or with boiled potatoes, lettuce, stewed prunes or apple 
qn 11 pp 

CHICKEN IN GELATINE. 

Put a small veal bone to boil with the chicken. When ten- 
der, take a part of the broth, add some vinegar to it, boil for 
ten minutes with onions and spiced herbs. Cut the chicken 
into pieces, place in a deep bowl, and pour the hot broth and 
vinegar over it. Cool and serve the next day. Use about y 2 
cup of vinegar to I quart of broth. 

Another way is to pour pure, hot vinegar over the meat in 
the bowl, let it stand an hour or longer, then pour off the vine- 
gar, and pour enough broth on the meat to cover it. Meat 
preserved in this way will keep on ice or in a cool place for a 
week. The meat and gelatine may be brought to a boil again 
at the end of the week. This will preserve it for a longer time. 
Goose may be prepared in the same manner. 

LAMB OR PORK IN GELATINE. 

The loin is the best part for this purpose. Prepare with veal 
bone like chicken. 

PORK CUTLETS. 
Prepare the same as veal cutlets. Fry with plenty of onions.

parsley. HAMBURG STEAK. 

Grind some round steak in a meat grinder. Shape into flat 
cukes and fry in. hot fat with plenty of onions. Turn from side 
to side while frying. 

STEAMED LIVER. 

Liver must be fresh in order to be wholesome. During hot 
weather it may become dangerous as a food after it is one day 
old. Remove the toxic blood by placing the liver in water or 
sour milk for one hour. Change the water several times. 
Then remove the skin and tie some bacon or suet over it. Roll 
in flour and steam in fat for 20 minutes. Then, add sufficient 
boiling water to half cover the meat. Flavor with bay leaves, 
salt, pepper and plenty of onions, also add a little vinegar and 
sugar, and steam for about an hour. Keep the saucepan well 
covered. Serve with potatoes or with apple and lettuce salad. 
The gravy can be strained and used the next day for breakfast 
or supper. See recipe for flavoring of sauces. 

HASH. 

Chop fine any kind of left-over, cold meat. Mix with one- 
third portion of grated or mashed potatoes, and add plenty of 
finely chopped onion and parsley. Brown some flour and but- 
ter, add a little soup stock and mix with the meat. Cook and 
serve on toast or with salad of greens.

a wire sieve. TON GUE IN GELATINE. 

Fresh left-over tongue may be kept for a while by preserving 
it in gelatine with veal bone. 

BRAINS. 

Brains are very nutritious, but they are not a wholesome 
food for people with chronic indigestion. They should be 
served on dry toast and eaten with sour salads of fruits and 

SALISBURY STEAK. 

Secure some fresh, thick, sliced, round steak. Scrape, or 
grind in a meat-cutting machine, and mould into flat, round 
Cokes. Have an iron spider very hot and oiled to prevent stick- 
ing. Lay the meat cake in, and turn from side to side till 
cooked sufficiently. 

CREAMED CHIPPED BEEF. 

Bring to a boil some soup stock from veal or mutton bone, 
thicken with cornstarch or white flour, boil 10 minutes, and add 
one-quarter or one-third part of hot cream. Cut or chop the 
dried beef fine, pour over it some boiling water, let stand a 
minute, then drain, and mix the beef with the cream gravy. 
Add a pinch of pepper, if desired. In place of cream, milk and 
butter may be substituted and prepared like butter sauce.

been added. Roast it in the same pan with the turkey or pre- 
pare it for another meal. 

LIGHT BREAD DRESSING FOR TURKEY 

OR CHICKEN. 

Remove the crust from a small loaf of graham bread. Crum- 
ble up the soft part and mix with chopped parsley, onion, gar- 
lic, thyme, marjoram, sage, salt, one well beaten egg and one- 
half cup of finely chopped fat of the bird, or suet. This is suffi- 
cient for an 8-pound turkey. This dressing is especially good 
for people with delicate stomachs. 

BOILED BACON. 

Select firm, eastern bacon. Wash thoroughly with cold and 
warm water. Let it come to a boil, throw away the water and 
pour on some fresh water. Boil about an hour. Let it cool 
on a platter and use the next day. Warm, fat meat is not 
wholesome for a delicate stomach. 

FRIED BACON. 

Parboil the bacon for one-half hour. Follow directions for 
boiled bacon. Let it cool and slice for frying. If the bacon is 
preferred raw, pour some boiling water over sliced bacon, let 
stand 5 minutes, pour off the water and fry or broil in the oven. 

LEAF LARD. 

Chop some leaf lard very fine and let it stand in. cold water 
for several hours, or over night. Fry in an iron skillet, with 
apples and onions, until crisp and brown. Strain the lard into 
a bowl and serve the residue warm with stale black bread. 
Spread the lard on black bread. 

BACON FAT. 

Remove the fat from boiled or fried bacon, and spread on 
stale black bread. Combine with raw apples. This is good for 
breakfast. 



CHAPTER III. 

FISH, CHEESE AND EGGS. 

Fish should be cleansed as soon as it is caught, or directly 
after delivery from the market, and preserved with salt until 
ready for cooking. If the fish is to be fried, the salt should be 
washed off, the fish thoroughly dried and rolled in egg and rye 
nuts, or flour. If the fish is to be boiled, the salt should also 
be washed off, and the water for seasoning be flavored with 
spiced herbs. If more salt is necessary, add it to the water. 

BOILED FISH. 

Prepare as directed in the foregoing. 

Fish in gelatine can be prepared with veal bone as directed 
for chicken. For gravies with boiled fish, see chapter on 
"Sauces." 

SHELL FISH. 

Shell fish, as well as all other fish, should be eaten only when 
in season. People with chronic constipation and torpid liver 
should avoid shell fish because they are soft, and easily putrefy. 
Oysters and clams are a very valuable food for the sick, and 
also for the pregnant woman. They are rich in. lime substances 
and nourish the glands of the body. They should be served 
in combination with lemon and greens, or be prepared with 
milk. 

PICKLED HERRING. 

Clean and wash the fish. Place in a colander and add salt. 
Let stand for several hours. Then, wash the fish and dry ; roll 
in flour and fry in hot fat or oil. Serve warm with lemon, or 
lay in a stone jar. Add a few bay leaves, whole peppers, and 
raw onions. Bring some vinegar to a boil with an equal 
amount of water, pour over the fish and add the fat in which 
the fish have been fried. If they are kept for several weeks, an 
extra amount of fat should be added for covering, so as to ex- 
clude the air. 



FISH, CHEESE AND EGGS. 65 

FISH CAKES. 

Any left-over fish may be made into a nutritious dish for the 
morning, noon, or evening meal. 

Take equal quantities of finely chopped fish and grated po- 
tato, beat up several eggs with a little salt and pepper, add some 
thick cream, and flavor with grated onions. Form into balls 
with a tablespoon and fry in hot fat. Serve with rice, or with 
a salad of apples, or tomatoes and lettuce. 

CODFISH CAKES. 

Take one-third of shredded or finely chopped codfish .'with 
two-thirds of grated potatoes; prepare as in the foregoing 
recipe. 

COTTAGE CHEESE. 

Put some whole, or skim milk, into a pan and set in a cool 
room, which has plenty of fresh air. Do not cover the Dan. If 
the room is exposed to dust, put a few long sticks over the pan 
and cover with a cheese-cloth. When the milk begins to get 
thick, set the pan. into a larger pan with warm water, and keep 
it in a warm place or in the oven until the curd separates ; it 
must not become hard. Then put a cheese-cloth on a colander 
and pour the milk into it. Let stand for several hours, until 
the whey is thoroughly drained off. Then chop fine some green 
peppers or onions, mix with the cheese, add a little salt and 
pepper, and serve with apple or potato salad or spread on sand- 
wiches. A few teaspoonsful of sugar and caraway seed may 
be added in place of the onion and pepper. 

SOFT BOILED EGGS. 

Put the eggs into cold water, place on the stove, and when 
the water begins to boil, the eggs will be done. 

BOILED EGGS. No. 2. 

Pour boiling water over them and let stand on a hot stove for 
10 minutes. 

BOILED EGGS. No. 3.

Cut some hard boiled eggs in halves, pour the sauce over them. 
Serve with potatoes. 

OMELET. 

Mix a tablespoonful of flour with a half cup of warm milk or 
water, and a little salt. Beat up two eggs, mix well with flour 
and water, then pour into a hot pan in which some butter has 
been melted. Cover and bake on. the stove with moderate heat 
for eight or ten minutes. Turn if desired. Serve with lettuce 
and fruit sauce. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS. 

Beat together one-half cup of soup stock, milk or water, and 3 
eggs. Add one-half tablespoonful of flour and mix well. A 
little chopped, cold, salted meat may be added. Pour all into 
a hot pan with melted butter, and stir until it is stiff. 



CHAPTER IV. 

SOUPS. 

LEGUME SOUPS.. 

Soups prepared from legumes, fruits or cereals require an 
addition of fat in the form of butter, oil, the yolk of an egg, 
cream, or fat meat. 

A soup of peas, beans, corn or lentils may be prepared from 
left-over food or fresh cooked legumes. To one cup of cooked 
legumes add three to five cups of hot water or weak soup stock, 
boil or mix well, then strain. Heat one or two tablespoonsful 
of butter or half butter and half cooking oil, add to this one 
or two tablespoonsful of mixed flour, let boil, then add the hot 
broth at short intervals, stirring to prevent lumps. When all 
the broth is used, let the whole boil a few minutes. Remove 
from the fire, flavor with lemon juice, pepper, bay leaves, 
chopped fresh thyme, sage or parsley, and serve. 

To these soups an addition of hot cream may be made be- 
fore serving, if desired. They form a perfect and an economical 
meal without the addition of meat, eggs, fish or other protein 
foods. Celery, lettuce, raw apples and crackers with butter are 
a good addition. They should be well masticated, and the soup 
eaten with them very slowly. 

BEAN SOUP. 

Wash 1^2 cup of black, white red or mixed beans and soak 
in i quart of warm soft water over night. The next day add 
about 5 pints of cold or boiling water to the beans, let come 
to a boil; add two finely cut onions and 'a potato, parsley or 
other flavoring. Then wash J/ pound of bacon several times 
with hot and cold water and put on to boil in sufficient water 
to cover it. Let boil 5 or 10 minutes, pour off the water and 
put the bacon into the bean soup. Let all boil for about an 
hour; when the meat is tender, take it out and put on a plate 
to cool. Let the soup simmer slowly for 3 hours or longer ; 



68 SOUPS. 

then strain. Let stand a little while, remove the fat and mix 
it with 2 or 3 tablespoonsf'ul of flour in a clean saucepan over 
the fire, add the strained bean soup gradually, let all boil a few 
minutes and serve. If the soup is desired thin, use only a part 
of the fat and a little flour. A cupful of strained tomato juice 
and chopped parsley may be added before serving. This should 
make five soup plates full. Serve with fried bread or bread 
and butter and raw carrots. 

CREAM OF BEAN SOUP.

boiling water or soup stock. Heat some oil, butter or fat ; add 
flour, boil a few seconds ; then add the tomato juice gradually 
and a little salt. Boil all 3 to 5 minutes, then serve. It must 
be of the consistency of gravy. Raw cucumbers and celery are 
a good addition. 

CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP. 

Prepare like the foregoing. Add *4 part or more of hot cream 
before serving. If milk is used, it must be more in proportion 
than, cream. 

CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP. No. 2.

berry gruel. 



cHERRy 

Remove the stones from one quart of cherries, and bring 
two quarts of water to a boil with a stick of cinnamon, pour in 
the cherries and let them simmer for 20 or 30 minutes. Add 
enough sugar to counteract the tart taste and thicken with a 
little cornstarch. Cool and serve with zwieback. If used for 
supper on hot days it should be prepared in the morning, and 
allowed to cool. Beaten whites of eggs with a little sugar may 
be placed on top. Serve on soup-plates.

asparagus, parsley, carrots, turnips, add to the soup ; young 
peas, bay leaves, whole pepper and chopped bacon may be 
added. Cover tightly, and boil slowly for two or three hours. 
Then brown several tablespoonsful of flour in the same amount 
of butter, add to the soup, and boil ten minutes longer. Strain 
and serve. A glass of Madeira or white wine may be added. 



70 SOUPS. 

BEEF SOUP. No. 2. 

Prepare like number one. Instead of brown flour, add one- 
half cup of barley which has been soaked and boiled in a small 
amount of water for an hour. Then add to the soup, boil all 
together for an hour or longer, strain and serve. A good addi- 
tion to boiled beef is a salad of celery root, or apples, or potato 
dumplings. 

CLEAR SOUP, WITH RICE. 

Select some fresh chicken, beef, lamb or several kinds of 
meat. Wash thoroughly, and put into boiling water, add salt 
and skim. Flavor with potatoes, onions, or any kind of greens 
which is most desirable. Boil two or three hours and strain.

milk. 

Clear broth beaten up with yolks of several eggs may be 
served in cups. 

VEGETABLE SOUP, WITH MEAT. 
Wash a piece of bacon or ham thoroughly, cover with cold 
water and bring to a boil. Pour the water off and put on again 
in boiling water. When the meat is half done add some bay 
leaves, carrots, celery, young peas, asparagus, parsley, cauli- 
flower, and dried prunes or pears and cinnamon. When the 
vegetables are tender, brown some butter and flour, mix with 
finely chopped marjoram and thyme; add to the soup, boil a 
few minutes longer, and serve. This is excellent in the spring-

CHAPTER VI. 
BREADS, CAKES AND PUDDINGS. 

POMPERNICKLE OR BLACK BREAD. 
Prepare a sponge with a pint of white flour, three-fourths of 
a yeast cake, a little salt and sugar, and a pint of warm water. 
When light, add two quarts of rye meal, a tablespoonful of salt 
and about one quart of water. Mix well, and let rise over 
night. The next morning add about one quart of warm rye 
meal, and one of white flour; knead the dough for at least one- 
half hour. Let rise again, knead a little more, and shape into 
loaves. When light, bake in a hot oven, for about an hour. 
Pure rye meal may be used in place of one-fourth white flour. 

WHOLE WHEAT BREAD. 

Prepare the same as black bread. Use whole wheat flour 
in place of rye meal. 

LIGHT WHOLE WHEAT BREAD. 
Make a sponge from one cupful of luke warm water and one 
cake of yeast, with enough white flour to make the thickness 
of sponge cake. Cover and set in a warm place, about 90 de- 
grees F. When foamy, add about three pints of luke warm 
water, or milk which has been scalded and cooled to luke warm, 
about two teaspoonsful of salt, a little sugar and a piece of 
butter or fat. Stir into it with a spoon sufficient white flour 
to make it of the same consistency as the first sponge. Beat it 
from 10 to 15 minutes, dust the top with flour, and put it into 
a w 7 arm place to rise. When light, add enough whole wheat 
flour to make a stiff dough. Put it on bread-board with flour 
to prevent sticking, knead for half an hour or longer, and let 
it rise again. When light, shape in loaves without kneading, 
put into pans and prick top with a fork several times. When 
sufficiently raised, bake in hot oven for about an hour. Cover 
top with pieces of oiled paper, the first 20 or 30 minutes. When 
done, put the bread on a sieve or in towels to cool. 



BREAD AND CAKES. 85 

LIGHT GRAHAM BREAD. 
Prepare in the same manner as light whole wheat bread. 

WHITE BREAD. 

Prepare the same as whole wheat bread, using pure, rich 
milk, cream and water, or sweet whey. Add a large piece of 
butter or cocoanut. Use white flour instead of whole wheat, 
mix it with one-fourth white corn meal, or rice flour. 

COFFEE CAKE. 

Prepare the same as white bread, using less flour, and add 
a few well beaten eggs, the grated rind of several lemons and 
oranges, or flavor with nutmeg, dried fruit, vanilla, mace or 
bitter almonds. Serve with fresh, sweet milk, or with scalded 
milk, as a whole meal for supper. 

All breads and cakes made with yeast are more nutritious 
and wholesome when stale, on account of the evaporation of 
water and the changes which take place in the bread. They 
should be kept in tins with holes on all sides, to allow a perfect 
circulation of air. The tins should be placed in the sunlight, 
or on a high, dry place near a stove. In many foreign countries 
pompernickle is kept for many months during the winter by 
placing it on top of high stone ovens near the ceiling. It 
finally assumes a sweet taste similar to that of nuts. 

Bread and cake may be kept sweet and free from mildew 
for a long time in the following way : Cut it with a sharp knife, 
when about four days old, into slices about one inch thick, 
then place it on a large, wire screen in the hot sunshine, cover 
with a cheese cloth, and let it lie for several hours, turning each 
slice until thoroughly dry. Then place the slices in an upright 
position in a square box made of wire screening, and keep in a 
dry or sunny place, covered with a light cloth. The box may 
be placed in the sunshine several times a week. 

ROMAN MEAL BREAD. 

Prepare the same as whole wheat bread, and use Roman 
meal instead of whole wheat flour. 

BISCUITS. 

Mix one quart of white flour with one-fourth of entire wheat 
flour, corn meal, or rice flour. Mix it thoroughly with two 



86 BREAD AND CAKES. 

level teaspoonsful of salt, and four of baking powder. Rub 
into it two tablespoonsful of vegetable fat or butter. Mix with 
rich milk and prepare as usual. Serve with salted, preserved 
meat and eggs, or with rich cheese and olives and salad of 
greens. 

POP-OVERS. 

Grease the iron gem pans, and place on the stove or in the 
oven, to have them very hot. Then beat two eggs very light, 
mix a cup of rich milk with a cup of flour, and a half teaspoon- 
ful of salt; add the eggs and beat with an egg beater until all 
is very light. Pour the mixture into the pans, filling two-thirds 
full, and bake in a quick oven. This will make about eight

CHAPTER VII. 
SAUCES AND SALAD DRESSINGS. 

SAUCES. 

Sauces are a necessary addition, to cooked foods, especially 
in cold weather. The proper utensils used for sauce making 
are wooden spoons and flat, round bottomed saucepans. 

Good fresh butter, oil and dry flour are necessary to make 
nutritious sauces. Flour for thickening should boil at least 
ten minutes. If the flour is to be cooked with fat before the 
liquid is added, only a few minutes of boiling is necessary, for 
the reason that fat, when boiled, reaches a higher temperature 
than water or milk. Mixed flour is preferable to pure wheat 
flour. Sauces prepared from soup stock, vegetables or fruits 
and gelatines are a better addition to meats than brown gravies, 
which are prepared from the small amount of juice which is 
extracted from the meat by roasting. Sauces prepared in the 
latter way are too rich as a food if eaten in combination with 
meat; they are a perfect meal by themselves if eaten in com- 
bination with whole wheat bread and greens. 

BUTTER SAUCE. No. i. 

Melt three tablespoonsful of butter, or half butter and half 
oil, mix with two tablespoonsful of flour over the fire, and boil 
for a few seconds. Then add gradually a pint of boiling water 
or soup stock or hot whey, while stirring it. Boil a few min- 
utes. Flavor with salt, onion, chopped parsley, celery, nutmeg, 
bay leaves, an.chovy-paste, lemon, chopped salted meat or what- 
ever flavor is desired. Serve with meat or fish.

utes, and add hot cream and flavoring.

tablespoonsful of cold water, remove the sauce from the fire, 
add the almond butter and stir thoroughly. Serve with baked 
apples, rice, or bread. 

OLIVE SAUCE.

remove the stones and add to the sauce, boiling all a few min- 
utes. Serve with duck, game, fish or meat. 



TOO SAUCES. 

DRIED CURRANT SAUCE. 

Soak the currants in boiling water, and let stand thirty min- 
utes. Prepare a plain butter sauce from butter, flour, and hot 
water, and when done mix the currants with it. It can, be pre- 
pared with soup stock or fish-water, and served with boiled 
white fish or boiled beef. 

BACON SAUCE. 

Cut some bacon into pieces about the size of lump sugar. 
Fry until brown. Pour the fat into a stone jar -and put the 
bacon on a plate. Mix a tablespoonful of the bacon fat and one 
r .i butter with a tablespoonful of flour, and add hot water, whey, 
or soup stock. Flavor with chopped parsley or strained tomato 
juice and add the bacon. 

FLAVORING OF MEATLESS SOUPS AND SAUCES. 
Soups and sauces prepared with flour and water may be im- 
proved by an addition of left-over meat gravies or with crisp 
bacon and flavored with finely cut onions. 

MINT SAUCE. 

Wash half a handful of young fresh mint, pick the leaves 
from the stalks, and chop them very fine. Make a plain butter 
sauce with soup stock, and add vinegar and sugar to suit the 
taste. Then remove from the fire, mix with the chopped mint, 
and serve with lamb or mutton. 

LEMON SAUCE. 

Wash a lemon, remove the peel and steep in three cups of 
water for fifteen minutes. Add the juice of one or two lemons 
and the necessary amount of sugar. Dissolve three teaspoons- 
ful of cornstarch with a little cold water and stir into the lemon 
juice. Boil ten minutes. Remove from the fire and mix with 
a tablespoonful of butter while warm. The lemon rind can be 
grated and added to the sauce instead of boiling the rind. This 
is good for steamed puddings. The yolk of an egg may be 
added. CHERRY SAUCE.

stick of cinnamon. Add a little sugar and thicken with corn- 
starch or arrowroot. Strain or leave the cherries in it.

SALAD DRESSINGS FOR MEATS, CEREALS, FISH, 
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS. 

They can be prepared from oil, butter, eggs, cream or nut 
butter. Dressings prepared from nut butter are especially good 
during the summer months. They can be prepared by making 
a plain butter sauce with flour and water, and adding nut butter 
before serving, or by diluting nut butter with water to the 
desired consistency. They may be flavored with orange or 
lemon juice. If a sweet flavor is desired, boil a little water 
with sugar, then add the juice of lemon or oranges and *mix 
with nut butter. Serve hot or cold.

Mix three tablespoonsful of olive oil with one of vinegar, or 
with the juice of one lemon and one grated onion. To this 
may be added sugar, pepper, salt, parsley or mustard, if de- 
sired. The proportion of oil and vinegar may be changed ac- 
cording to the taste. For fruit salads, lemon should always be 
used instead of vinegar. For raw vegetables, the dressing 
should not be poured over the salad until ready to serve.

CHAPTER IX. 
GELATINES AND TOASTS. 

GELATINE PREPARATIONS. 

Gelatine is a valuable food for the sick. The nutritive value 
of gelatine is under-estimated. While it alone cannot sustain 
life, it is superior to beef tea, and if eaten with other articles 
which supply the elements which it lacks, it can partially take 
the place of meat and other nitrogenous foods for sick people 
and for people of sedentary habits. For people who do hard 
labor gelatine is of little value. 

FRUIT GELATINE. 

To prepare fruit gelatine the acid and super-acid fruits are 
best, and no more sugar should be used than is necessary. 
Gelatine preparations must be kept on ice, or in a very cold 
place, and not be prepared in large quantities, as they easily 
putrefy. For the sick and for children, it should not stand 
longer than twenty-four hours, and it should not be kept in 
metallic dishes. The best time to serve gelatine is for the 
evening meal. It may be served wtih sterilized cream, and 
zwieback or wafers. 

Prepare some gelatine according to directions on package. 
Add to it juice from preserved apples, cherries, raspberries, 
strawberries or currants. 

GELATINE PUDDING MADE WITH SOUR MILK. 
Prepare some white gelatine with two cups of water. Take 
twice the amount of gelatine directed and add one-half cup of 
sugar. Remove from the fire, cool slightly, then add two 
cups of sour milk which has been beaten, and mix all well. 
Flavor and set in a cool place. Serve with sweet cream and 
zwieback. 

WHIPPED SOUR MILK. 

Beat one quart of thick, sour milk with an egg beater for 
10 minutes. Serve with zwieback in soup plates. Three-fifths 



112 GELATINES. 

lablespoonful of powdered sugar and a little cinnamon may 
be added, if it is agreeable. 

Whipped sour cream may be prepared the same as sour milk. 

WHIPPED SWEET CREAM.

tablespoonful of powdered sugar, add a little vanilla, if desired. 
Serve with fruit gelatines or ground white figs, stewed prunes, 
baked apples or raw fruits, such as peaches, strawberries, rasp- 
berries or bananas. 

BANANA GELATINE. 

Prepare some gelatine with orange, cranberry or lemon 
juice. When nearly cold, cut up some bananas and mix with 
the gelatine. Flavor and set on ice, serve with whipped or 
sterilized cream.

Prepare some gelatine with lemon or orange juice. When 
nearly cold, add some fresh or canned pineapple. Serve with

through a cheesecloth. The next day remove the fat, bring 
to a boil again, add one to two cups of wine, the juice and rind 
of several lemons or oranges, and sufficient sugar to counter- 
act the sour taste. Pour into a dish which has been oiled, and 
set on ice. It may be served with whipped cream or the beaten 
whites of eggs, and shredded wheat or zwieback.

SNOW PUDDING. 

Soak some gelatine according to directions. Add a pint of 
boiling water, some tart fruit juice and the necessary amount of 
sugar. Let it come to a boil, stir and strain, and let stand in a

the whites of two eggs with a little salt or lemon juice, and 
sugar, and mix with the gelatine. Pour into molds and set on 
ice. Serve with whipped cream or custard sauce. 

RICE GELATINE. 

Boil one cup of rice in about three pints of water with a

eral hours, or over night; one-half cupful of rylax or black 
crusts may be added. Bring to a boil slowly and let simmer 
for 15 or 20 minutes. Soak some gelatine, a little less than the 
directions call for. Add the strained bran juice and a few 
dried currants which have been soaked in boiling water. If 
sugar is desired, add a small tablespoonful. Let it come al- 
most to the boiling point, add salt, and put into molds. Serve 
plain or with sterilized cold cream. 

RYE GELATINE. 

Prepare like bran, gelatine, using less bran. Toast thorough- 
ly brown three or four slices of stale pompernickel and soak

hot milk an,d heat to the boiling point. Then mix with the hot 
milk containing the chocolate, pour into molds or cups, and set

hot cream to it. Small white and lima beans are excellent in 
the summer. 

PEA AND LENTIL TEA. 

Prepare the same as bean tea. Dry green peas are richer in 
minerals than yellow peas. Yellow peas contain more starch. 



PART THREE 



CHAPTER I. 
FOOD REQUIREMENTS. 

It is important that the diet should contain the proper 
amount of protein, starches and fats, suitable to the individual 
needs. Age, weight, size, occupation, season and climate 
must all be considered. The majority of civilized men and 
\vomen consume from two to three times the amount of food 
necessary. Numerous and careful researches regarding food 
requirements have been made during the last fifty years. 

The composition, of American food materials and the dietary 
standards of Professors Voit and Atwater can be found on the 
last pages of this book. 

The recent experiments of Professor Chittenden, of Yale 
University, have demonstrated that 60 grams of protein, with 
the necessary amount of fats and carbohydrates to yield from 
1500 to 2500 calories per day, is sufficient. These requirements 
are regarded as presenting the minimum of what is necessary 
for the maintenance of health, strength and activity. To take 
more food than the body requires means not only waste of food, 
but an unnecessary strain upon the body, by this excess, which 
must be gotten rid of at the expense of energy, that could be 
more profitably expended for other purposes. 

The sample menus given on following pages are taken from 
the results of my own experimental work with different people, 
under different conditions, and of weights varying from 130 to 
160 pounds. They were people in poor health, suffering from 
lack of nutrition brought about by unsuitable food, such as too 
much protein or starchy foods; insufficient fats and minerals 
in the food ; excess of cooked foods ; improper combinations and 
wrong time for eating. Some improved in health and strength 
immediately after the change of diet, and were able to do from 



138 FOOD REQUIREMENTS. 

eight to twelve hours of active work, while others found it 
necessary to take a rest and develop their stomachs gradually 
by a change to raw foods. 

I am convinced that the amount of protein presented in the 
sample bills of fare is sufficient for the average individual, pro- 
vided the food is properly masticated, digested and assimilated, 
and not forced down by artificial stimulants and poisonous bev- 
erages. The amount of carbohydrates and fat required differs 
greatly with different temperaments and individual peculiari- 
ties, and must be determined by the individual himself. Those 
who can use a considerable amount of cereals and fruits re- 
quire less fat, while others who are not so well able to digest 
large amounts of starchy foods and fruits require more fats. 

Cooked foods are more easily digested than raw foods, but 
the nutritive value is very definitely influenced by the process 
of cooking; therefore it is important to consume as much food 
as possible in the raw state.

FOOD FOR THE AGED 



Many people at the ages of sixty and seventy still lead an 
active life, while others retire from activity at forty-five or fifty. 
Therefore, the food must conform to the person's mental and 
physical requirements. If the teeth are poor and the digestive 
powers are weak, the food should be light, consisting mainly 
of well cooked cereals, baked potatoes, rice, cooked greens, a 
small -amount of meat, raw fruits and raw greens in combina- 
tion with fatty foods, as salads, milk and buttermilk, toasted 
breads and soups. The total fuel requirement depends upon 
whether the individual leads a quiet or active existence. For 
a person who lives mainly indoors, and makes little use of the 
muscles of the arms, shoulders and trunk, 1000 to 1200 calories 
is sufficient for twenty-four hours. If more food is eaten than 
the body requires, the excess will manifest itself by the develop- 
ment of chronic ailments and obesity, or feeble-mindedness. 

The morning and evening meals should consist of fluid and 
semi-fluid foods, or of toasted breads and salads. Meats, eggs 
(except the yolks), cheese, beans, peas and nuts should be 
eaten only during the middle of the day in small quantities. 
One can cut down his amount of food greatly by thoroughly 
chewing each morsel. The demand for protein at this period 
is small, while the amount of fat should be increased. A few 
srmple bills of fare may be of assistance to those who wish to 
make a study of food requirements for themselves or for others.

CHAPTER II. 

DIET DURING PREGNANCY. 

A healthy woman will be guided by intuition, as to the selec- 
tion of food suited to her condition. Unfortunately, only a 
few women are properly matured in these days of forced edu- 
cation and unnatural occupations for young girls during the 
age of puberty. 

The craving of pregnant women for pickles, spices and cer- 
tain fruits out of season indicates an anemic condition. The 
individual longs for an article, of which her mind is most con- 
scious, to bring about satisfaction. 

Pregnant women, require a larger amount of phosphates, 
lime and other minerals in their food, especially during the 
first four months. The amount of food taken should be rather 
less in quantity: and the starches and sweets should be cut 
down as much as possible, unless the mother has to perform 
a large amount of physical work. 

Vomiting during the early months of pregnancy is generally 
due to excess of starches and indigestible foodstuffs. The 
eliminating organs not being able to throw off the excess 
of waste, the system rids itself of it through the effort of the 
liver, before the waste enters the blood stream. 

A suitable diet depends much upon the constitution of the 
mother. In severe cases of vomiting or headache, a diet 
should be prescribed by a physician. 

DIET FOR THE MOTHER AFTER LABOR. 
This is another important period for the welfare of the 
mother as well as of the infant. Improper feeding during the 
first month after the child is born is responsible for many 
nervous breakdowns of the mother, at the time when she 
should be in the best of health and ready to take charge of 
her infant. A healthy new born infant can stand an enormous 
amount of abuse in the matter of feeding before it is sent to 
an early grave, or before the foundation is laid for a life of 
long suffering. 



DIET DURING PREGNANCY. 151 

The mother's milk during the first month of the infant's 
life is richer in cream and sugar than in the later months. 
Therefore, such foods should be given as yield these ele- 
ments to the milk. The mother herself, having expended a 
large amount of energy, demands a food rich in lime, fats, 
sugar and organic salts. The physiological enlargement of the 
abdominal organs must be treated with great care. 

As a rule, no food is required during the first few hours 
except water. In exceptional cases where the mother is greatly 
exhausted, a glass of fresh milk or some warm stimulating food 
may be served. 

The food during the first four days should consist largely of 
strained water gruels, prepared from steel cut oats and bran, 
or from rolled wheat or cream of wheat. Stewed prunes, 
toast, soft boiled eggs or other egg foods should be served 
once per day at the noon meal. Fresh milk is best given dur- 
ing the afternoon or evening or at 10 a. m. A slice of toast 
may be served with it. If the milk of the mother is scanty, 
serve water gruels several times per day. If the mother has 
too much milk, fluid foods should be restricted and a dry diet 
adopted. After the fourth day add rice, baked potatoes, fish 
and a small amount of meat to the diet. Avoid drinking milk 
or other liquid food, except a little water with the dinner. If 
milk or broth is desired, take it at the beginning of the meal. 
Avoid artificially prepared desserts at the end of the meal. 
Use oranges or grapes as desserts, or a little black coffee and 
toast. 



Suggestive Menus for Breakfast during the First Week. 

1. Three-fourths of a pint of barley gruel with or without 
cream, 2 crusts. 

2. Eight ounces of cornmeal mush with egg and dried fruit.

CHAPTER III. 
CARE AND FEEDING OF CHILDREN. 

THE NURSERY. 

The nursery should be well lighted and ventilated, and if 
possible be located on the southeast side of the house. The 
windows should be broad and not too low. The wall-paper 
should be a cheerful green, or blue with designs of lighter 
shades, and the rug of brown or tan color. Avoid all bric-a- 
brac, useless curtains, and other hangings which tend to 
darken the room, gather dust and absorb odors. The furni- 
ture should be adapted to the size and needs of the child. 
During the first four years the meals are best served in the 
nursery, or at a time when the parents are not at the table. 
It avoids much unnecessary excitement and temptation, and 
if the child is under the constant care of the mother it will 
give her relief during these hours. All children between the 
ages of four and ten should have their evening meals served 
alone, or else be so well trained as not to expect to eat the same 
food as the adults. 



PREPARATION OF FOOD FOR INFANTS. 

MILK. 

In preparing modified milk or other fluid foods for infants, 
where top milk is used, it is very important that the milk con- 
tain the same amount of cream for each feeding, or else diges- 
tive disturbance and irregularity of bowel movements will 
occur. 

If milk, fresh from the cow and run through the cooler, is 
put into bottles or jars and kept at the same temperature, the 
same percentage of top-milk will be obtained daily. Five 
hours is generally sufficient to obtain the desired quality. 
The best means of removing it is by a spoon, or siphon. 



154 FOOD FOR INFANTS. 

If raw milk is used without being sterilized, the desired 
amount for each meal should be put into sterile bottles di- 
rectly after delivery and lightly covered by cheese-cloth or 
cotton and kept on ice or other cold place. In this way each 
bottle will contain the same amount of cream. 

PREPARATION OF MODIFIED MILK (RAW). 

Put the desired amount of top-milk into as many bottles as 
are required for feeding during twelve hours. Prepare a 
solution of water and milk-sugar by dissolving the sugar with 
the desired amount of boiling water. Let cool and keep on 
ice for twenty-four hours. At each feeding, add the prescribed 
amount of water to the milk, shake and heat in. a water bath. 
Add a tablespoonful of lime water or barley water. If the milk 
cannot be obtained fresh twice per day, it is safer to scald the 
i.nlk which is used during the night. 

All milk, even if handled carefully, contains a large number 
of germs. When one is not certain that the cows from which 
the milk is obtained are healthy, the milk should be sterilized. 
During the summer it is safer to scald or sterilize all milk for 
infants. 

SCALDED MILK (MODIFIED). 

Dissolve the desired amount of milk sugar in boiling water 
in a clean saucepan, add the milk, stir over a quick fire until it 
foams, which means that the milk is heated to about 200 F. 
The most harmful germs are generally destroyed by this pro- 
cess. Pour the milk into a clean pitcher and set the latter in a 
pan of cold water. Stir the milk until cold and change the 
water several times., The stirring makes the milk homo- 
geneous and easier to digest. If any scum has formed on top, 
through careless preparation, the milk should be strained 
through a cheese-cloth before putting it into bottles. Put a 
cotton stopper in the bottles and set on ice. Milk prepared 
in this manner is generally suitable for the average healthy 
infant. 

STERILIZED MILK (MODIFIED). 

Dissolve the milk sugar as directed for scalding milk. Add 
the desired amount of milk, top-milk or cream, and prepare as 
directed in the chapter under "Sterilized Milk." 



FOOD FOR INFANTS. 155 

PASTEURIZED MILK. 

Put the desired amount of milk or milk and cream mixture 
into sterile bottles, put on a stopper and set in a water bath; 
heat the water to 155 or 170 F., and keep it at that tempera- 
ture for 30 minutes. Then, remove the bottles at once, cool 
them in a pan of cold water and set on, ice. 

BOILED MILK. 

Put the desired amount of milk, or modified milk, into a 
clean saucepan, stir over a hot fire and boil from 2 to 5 minutes. 
Then cool by setting the pitcher into a pan of cold water; stir 
until cold and set on ice. This is excellent for infants as well 
as for the sick who suffer with diarrhoea. The milk may be 
modified with arrow-root, barley water or rice flour gruel, 
which has been boiled with salt and water and a stick of cinna- 
mon. Milk-sugar should be boiled with the gruels, two level 
tablespoonsful to a pint of boiling water. 

ESKAY'S FOOD. 

Prepare as directed on label or use like the foregoing in 
place of arrow-root. 

DR. BIEDERT'S MILK AND CREAM MIXTURES. 

ist month 4 ounces of cream, no milk, 12 ounces of water, 

3 tablespoonsful of milk-sugar. 
2nd month 4 ounces of cream, 2 ounces of milk, 12 ounces of 

water, 3 tablespoonsful of milk-sugar. 
3rd month 4 ounces of cream, 4 ounces of milk, 12 ounces of 

water, 3 tablespoonsful of milk-sugar. 
4th month 4 ounces of cream, 8 ounces of milk, 12 ounces of 

water, 3 tablespoonsful of milk-sugar. 
5th month 4 ounces of cream, 12 ounces of milk, 12 ounces of 

water, 3 tablespoonsful of milk-sugar. 
6th month no cream, 16 ounces of milk, 8 ounces of water, 

2 tablespoonsful of milk-sugar. 



156 FOOD FOR INFANTS. 

DIRECTION FOR PREPARATION. 

Put the desired amount into a saucepan and scald, as di- 
rected under "Scalding Milk," or put into bottles and pasteur- 
ize or sterilize. 

If the bowels of an infant are too loose, lessen the amount 
of cream, and add more milk in place of it. If the child is 
constipated, add more cream and use less milk. If it disagrees, 
add oatmeal, rice, rye, barley or legume water. For prepara- 
tion, see "Teas," in. Chapter on Fluids. Use one-half the 
amount of water, as directed above, add the other half in the 
form of tea. Prepare the tea separately, and add the desired 
amount to each bottle when heating. Camomile tea is often 
beneficial for a few days. It can be added in the same manner 
as other teas, or given, without sugar or cream, when colic 
appears. The latter way is preferable to too much hot water, 
when the infant is suffering with colic. 

ORIGINAL RECIPE FOR DELICATE INFANTS. 

Mixture of Cream, Milk, Water, Milk-Sugar, Rice Flour and 
Pearl Barley (Condensed Milk, if Required). 

' Dissolve two tablespoonsful of rice flour in a little cold 
water, stir into twelve ounces of boiling water, add one-fourth 
of a teaspoonful of salt, and boil for 20 minutes. Pour into a 
pitcher and keep on ice for 24 hours. Use. 

Soak one-fourth of a cup of pearl barley for several hours, 
or over night. Boil with a quart of water and a little salt for 
one and one-half hours. This will make about ten ounces of 
barley water when strained. Keep the barley water and rice 
flour gruel in separate pitchers. If an additional amount of 
condensed milk is found more agreeable, add one tablespoonful 
of Eagle Brand Condensed Milk to the barley water in- place of 
milk-sugar, before straining it. 

Prepare the milk as follows : Dissolve two tablespoonsful 
of milk-sugar in ten ounces of boiling water, add four ounces 
of cream and four of milk, stir the milk and water in. a sauce- 
pan over a quick fire until it foams, and pour into eight clean, 
warm bottles which have been set in a kettle of hot water. 
Put cotton stoppers in the bottles, and pour enough water into 



FOOD FOR INFANTS. 157 

the kettle so that it is even with the milk in the bottles. Let 
it stand on a hot stove and keep the water at the temperature 
of 170 to 200 F. for half an hour. Then set the kettle on the 
floor and when, the water is cold, remove the bottles and put 
them on ice. At each feeding, add one ounce of the prepared 
barley water, and a tablespoonful of rice flour gruel to the 
bottle; shake well, and heat by setting the bottle in warm 
water. This will make about 28 ounces of food for 24 hours, 
or $ l / 2 ounces per bottle for eight feedings during 24 hours. 
This quantity is required for the average child during the 
second month. Ten feedings are generally required during 
the first month. 

During the first week of the infant's life use 5 ounces of 
cream, 5 ounces of water, 8 ounces of rice and barley water, 
and no milk. This makes 18 ounces of food for 24 hours, or 
about 2,y 2 ounces per bottle for ten feedings during 24 hours. 
If a larger quantity is desired during the first month, add 2^2 
ounces of water and 2 ounces of milk to the cream mixture, 
then gradually change to the proportion given in above for- 
mulas. As the child grows older, increase the amount of 
milk to 12 or 15 ounces until the age of ten months. After 
that age 42 ounces of food is required during 24 hours, and 
the child is generally able to begin with semi-liquid or solid 
food. The rice flour alone, or any other cereal gruel or water 
may be used in place of barley and rice, but the latter is found 
especially beneficial for delicate infants with whom plain modi- 
fied milk disagrees. 

It is often desirable to change the cereal occasionally. Use 
oats, rye and barley during the winter and the lighter cereals 
during the summer. Other suitable foods for the infant are 
bran or rye tea with or without milk or cream, and broths from 
veal or mutton with the yolk of an egg (10 ounces of broth to 
one yolk). Strained steel cut oats and bran are excellent for 
a while where milk or cream are found to disagree. 

During the period from the tenth to the fifteenth month the 
healthy infant requires an addition of solid food. The appear- 
ance of the teeth indicate when it should begin. The change 
must be made gradually from liquid to semi-liquid and finally 
to solid food. The middle of the day is the best time to begin 



158 SECOND PERIOD. 

with the change of food. Lean meat is not a necessary food 
for children, therefore it is mentioned only occasionally for 
those who think their children must have it. On. the other 
hand, legumes are a very important food for young children, 
and their use should begin during the second year. They are 
easily digested if prepared in the form of soups and purees, and 
combined as directed in the different menus. They should not 
be given at night. 

SECOND PERIOD: FROM THE TENTH TO 
THE FIFTEENTH MONTH. 

During this period the infant should sleep three times dur- 
ing the day: From 8 to 10 a. m., from i to 3 p. m., and from 6 
to 8 p. m. If the child should not awaken for the last feeding 
and sleep until 4 or 5 a. m., give the feeding at 4 a. m. instead 
of between 8 and 10 p. m. If it should be in the habit of 
awakening during the middle of the night, change the habit by 
awakening it at 10 p. m. Reduce the quantity of milk given 
at this time gradually to 3 or 4 ounces, and finally replace it by 
water. 

If the child should sleep from 6 p. m. to 6 a. m., without 
awakening, it does not require the extra feeding; four meals 
are sufficient. 

Some children require five meals until they are two years 
old. With intelligent study and simple regularity the mother 
can make her work very easy. She can transform delicate 
children into strong, vigorous ones, avoid disease and many 
unnecessary doctor bills. 

Do not begin, the habit of stuffing the child with bread and 
crackers every time it cries. If it desires something to bite 
upon give it a teething-ring. Give the child as many meals 
as it requires, but avoid feeding between meals. Give it cold 
or slightly warmed water between meals. Do not force the 
child to drink water. If fed correctly it will call for the neces- 
sary amount of water. If a child is too heavy in. weight for 
its age, reduce the amount of milk. Give it strained oatmeal, 
bran and barley gruels, with butter or cream. Some children 
require three pints of milk during 24 hours, between the tenth 
and fifteenth months, while others are satisfied with one and 



MENUS FOR THE SECOND PERIOD. 159 

one-half pints of milk and four to six ounces of cream. If 
broths or other nutritious liquids are substituted for milk, the 
amount of milk required for the day would be less than that 
mentioned above. Never force the child to eat food; when it 
awakens in the morning it generally requires food immediately. 
When it awakens for its dinner, let it play for a while until it 
calls for food. If it refuses food, leave out a meal once in a 
while, or reduce the number of meals to suit the appetite.-

Some children are able to digest all the above mentioned 
foods before they are three years old ; others are not. Certain 
foods are agreeable to certain, temperaments and disagreeable 
to others. No exact rules can be laid down. Reason and judg- 
ment must guide the mother in the selection of foods as well 
as in other details. 



164 GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS. 

Unleavened crackers, raw cereal flakes and stale sundried 
pompernickle or whole wheat bread are the best dry cereal 
foods for children. If cooked cereals are served, crackers and 
wheat bread are not necessary at the same meal. A few black 
crusts or raw vegetables combine better with cooked cereals. 

Soda crackers or thoroughly toasted unsweetened zwieback 
may be given occasionally for the evening meal in combina- 
tion with sago, fruit gruels or jellies. 

Do not feed a child fresh breads and cakes which contain 
soda, yeast or baking powder. 

A child over three years of age may eat occasionally unleav- 
ened fruit cake, pancakes and fruit tarts which are prepared 
with eggs. 

Never allow a child to eat ice-cream at the end of a heavy 
meal., Serve it at the beginning of the meal or during the 
afternoon. 

Four meals per day is generally the best plan for a child, 
as long as it sleeps during the day-time. If it is fed on plain, 
non-stimulating food it generally takes a nap up to the age of 
4 or 5 years, and sometimes later, while a child that is fed 
upon meats, beef juices, meat soups an-d excess of starch and 
sweets often refuses to sleep during the day-time at the age of 
two. 

Meats and sweets or excess of any kind of food irritate the 
sensitive nerves and produce restlessness and sleeplessness 
in the child, and much unnecessary work and sleepless nights 
of the mother. Any normal healthy child can be trained in the 
matter of eating, sleeping, evacuation of the bowels and in 
other details like clock-work, if the proper conditions are fur- 
nished. 

At the end of the third year the child may begin to eat well 
baked beans, peas or lentils several times per week during the 
winter, hey should be given at the noon, meal, in combina- 
tion with raw or finely mashed carrots, or with a tomato salad 
and raw greens. No more than two tablespoonsful should be 
given at one meal. Systematic training in chewing is abso- 
lutely necessary for a good digestion. If legume foods should 



WRONG MANAGEMENT. 165 

cause gas on the stomach, they must be strained and given in 
the form of soups or purees. Walnuts may also be used. Give 
two or three at the end of the meal. For combination, see 
''Menus for Adults." The amount of food should be increased 
gradually. At the age of 12 or 14, a child may eat nearly as 
much as an adult. 

Moving picture shows, car and automobile rides require 
more nervous energy than strolling in the woods. Instead of 
supplying the system with plain nutritious foods, such as milk, 
nut preparations or wholesome sandwiches on such occasions, 
the excitable nerves are generally more stimulated by artificial 
foods : candies, cookies, sweet graham crackers, gums or by 
exhilarating (pure fruit?) lemonade or germ laden ice-cream. 

Artificial lights and amusements of this kind, associated with 
nerve starvation, cause much eye trouble in children. Think 
of the amount of nervous and muscular energy expended dur- 
ing those hours in comparison with walks or other kind of 
natural amusements ! 

If the chewing of gum, candies and other fancies is per- 
missible in cars and theatres, why not wholesome foods? A 
small satchel will hold an aluminum can with milk, a few 
napkins and other wholesome food products. If confectionery 
and ice-cream parlors and cheap restaurants were supplanted 
by hygienic food laboratories and pure water stands, saloons 
would soon be on the decrease. 

WRONG MANAGEMENT. 

The dyspeptic business men and women who have no time 
or power to digest a meal during the middle of the day are 
generally the victims of early habits acquired when at school. 

We cannot try to change the fixed and immovable laws of 
nature without paying the penalty. Nature will keep us in 
order and control our machine, if we fulfill her laws. The sun 
is in sympathy with our digestive forces; therefore we should 
rest from labor during the middle of the day, so that the 
muscles of the stomach may be able to give all the circular 
movements, and others that are necessary, to thoroughly mix 
the food with the stomach juices for rapid digestion. Solid 
foods of the protein class, can only undergo perfect digestion 



i66 WRONG MANAGEMENT. 

if eaten in the middle of the day. They require many hours 
to digest, and in this way they are ready for oxidation and 
assimilation, at night, when the air is cool. The body can rest, 
and the lungs and heart can work better when the stomach 
is emptied. While on the other hand, if the heaviest meal is 
taken at night, it is either too rapidly digested by physical 
force, or it is left half digested in the stomach over night. It 
congests the liver and kidneys, produces fermentation, robs 
lungs, heart and skin of their nerve force, and creates an ab- 
normal appetite the next morning for an excess of energy- 
giving food, or it produces a languid feeling and loss of 
appetite. Such a system of living is responsible for the large 
number of acute and chronic diseases and consumption, while 
those who seemingly keep in good health under such condi- 
tions do surely shorten their life. 

Perfect health and comfort are worth more than earthly 
possessions, and those who strive earnestly to possess and 
retain health will find a way to change their system of living. 
There is strength in union, and if a sufficient number of sensi- 
ble people demanded different hours for school-children and 
for people who work indoors, it would be possible to obtain 
them. 

During hot summer days or in. the tropics the noon hour is 
not always the best for the heaviest meal of the day, but 
neither should it be spent for work. Two meals per day is the 
best plan on hot days. An individual who is always keyed 
up to the highest point during the middle of the day, and ex- 
pends the best of his energy for work, cannot expect anything 
else but bankruptcy. 

For people who desire two meals per day, the best time for 
breakfast is between nine and ten in the morning, and for 
dinner between three and four in the afternoon. 

If three meals are taken, hard muscular workers, or those 
who are employed out of doors, do well to substitute for their 
dinner a substantial cold or warm lunch. If through lack of 
time and convenience a child cannot have its dinner before 
4 p. m., it is better off without it. Remember that a cooked 
dinner consisting of meat, potatoes and vegetables is not at all 
necessary for the child's welfare and development, and cooked 



WRONG MANAGEMENT. 167 

vegetables should never be forced upon it if it prefers to eat 
them raw. Healthy children have keen instinct, and unless 
their appetite has become perverted by sweets and other arti- 
ficial, unnatural foods, they are more likely to select the right 
kind of food than the average adult. 

This book gives a large number of menus, consisting of raw 
foods, which can be quickly prepared when the child comes 
home from school. Nuts, fruits and raw vegetables form an 
ideal diet for the summer. Baked beans, peas and lentils 
warmed over, or jellied fish, egg foods, cheese or steamed pud- 
dings in combination with a warm soup or raw apples form a 
perfect meal during cold, winter days. If the dinner is eaten 
between the hours of 3 130 p. m. and 4 :oo p. m., no more food 
is necessary. If it is served at noon, give milk or soup be- 
twee'n 5 and 6 p. m. Children should take at least one-half an 
hour's rest before eating, when coming home from school. The 
better way would be to allow children two hours for their noon 
meal or curtail the hours of school work from 9 a. m. to 
i or 2 p. m. Such is the custom in many European countries, 
and there is no reason why it could not be practiced here. 

Children between the ages of eight and fourteen should retire 
between 7 and 8 p. m. If they get sufficient sleep and are 
properly fed, children's diseases need not be feared.

SANDWICHES. 

The sandwich is an important part of the bill of fare. It 
is not necessary to eat a cooked dinner in order to have a 
square meal, but for those who work indoors and are unable 
to take walking exercises before or after their noon meal, it 
is important to take some warm fluid or semi-fluid food in the 
form of broth, milk or soup as an entree or with their meal. 
With the convenience of modern inventions of gas, alcohol and 
electric stoves, or patented bottles which keep food warm for 
hours, this is easily obtained. 

An endless variety of nutritious lunches can be prepared 
from left-over or fresh vegetables, meats, fish, eggs and cheese, 
or from raw cereals, nuts, fruits and greens. The bread used 
for sandwiches should always be stale or sun dried and be 
kept in a dry place in a tin box with good ventilation. 

MENUS FOR LUNCH OR SUBSTITUTES

with it, either as a substitute for bread or in. combination with 
it. In place of whole nuts, nut-butter may be used; the latter 
should always be diluted with an equal amount of water. 

Figs, raisins or dried currants can be used in the same way 
as dates. Lettuce and celery are good additions. 

Tomatoes with Popcorn, Bread and Butter. 

6. Prepare a salad with tomato and lettuce, or strain some 
canned tomatoes. The latter can be carried conveniently in a

The harmony and disharmony between the different foods 
as mentioned above are only stated in a general way. Certain 
combinations are absolutely harmful to every individual, others 
are either harmful to certain temperaments, or, to mix them 
would mean a waste in the animal economy of the body. 

REMARKS. 

Use only one rich protein, food at any meal. 

Exceptions : A few nuts which are rich in fat may be eaten 
at the end of a meal where lean meat is served. 

Milk and milk soups may be taken at the beginning of a

with the meat dish or used at the end of a meal where meat is 
served.

MENUS. 

A menu which is one-sided or combined wrongly, that is, one 
in which either protein, carbohydrates, minerals or fluids are 
provided in excess, leads to waste of nervous energy as well 
as to waste of nutritive material. A wrong combination creates 
an abnormal appetite for too much or too little food. 

Each person should learn by experience to select the kinds 
of food which yield him nourishment and avoid those which 
disagree. 

MENUS FOR BREAKFAST.

season will find here a number of suitable breakfast menus to

WHAT SHALL WE DRINK WITH OUR MEALS? 

This question is often asked. It depends entirely on the 
quality and combination of food which is eaten. 

A diet consisting of a variety of solids and vegetables with 
excessive fluids gives the stomach nothing to do ; the contents 
pass at once into the intestines. Such mixtures are ingested 
instead of being digested ; they cannot be fully utilized because 
the stimuli upon the drainage of the body is lacking. 

If dry foods are eaten, such as sandwiches, rice, macaroni, 
potatoes or dry cereals, without the addition of fruits, vege- 
tables or soups, a small amount of liquid should be taken. 
Such simple foods do not form a perfect meal, therefore milk 
or broths are preferable to water. Water is best taken from 
five to fifteen minutes before the meal or from one to two hours 
after meals. Black malt coffee is sometimes beneficial if one- 
half cupful is taken after or with meals. It acts like a tonic, 
especially if the liver is sluggish.

i88 MENUS FOR SUPPER. 

For additional menus see recipes of soups, gelatines, salads, 
fish, sandwiches and egg foods. 

Many of the above menus are suitable for children and for 
people of sedentary habits. 

For those who require a liberal amount of nutritious food, it 
is easy to make up a number of additional menus from light 
protein foods for the evening meal, such as : Cream cheese, 
cottage cheese, Swiss cheese, fish, lamb chops, meat cakes 
(prepared from left-over cooked meats), eggs, pancakes (pre- 
pared with eggs or cream), fried egg-toast, sausages, legume 
soups, etc. Apples, tomatoes and prunes combine well with 
all the above mentioned foods.

If porridge with milk is desired for breakfast, substitute a 
quart of milk in place of apples, oil, lemon and onion. Use one 
and three-fourths cup of rolled wheat or rye in. place of two and 
one-half cups. If sugar is necessary, add fifteen prunes or five 
level tablespoons of sugar. During the summer, substitute 
carrots or cucumbers for the sweets. Raw, sweet or sub-acid 
fruits do not combine well with cooked cereals. Raw fruits 
and raw cereals is a better combination. 

In order to reduce the cost of living to 10 cents per person 
per day or 50 cents per day for all, leave out the fat meat cost- 
ing 15 cents, and some of the butter, replacing it by cooking 
oil. It is easy to modify the diet or add to it in a given direc- 
tion. If more protein is required, a boiled egg or a few nuts 
may be added to the breakfast. If more fuel is needed, it can 
be added in the form of soup, fruits or fat. In comparing the 
value of i pound of legumes with i pound of lean meat and the 
additional fatty and green foods that are necessary with a meat 
diet, the housewife will realize that she must either have a big 
purse for the bills of fare with meat, or starve her family if they 
do not like legumes. 

Ten. cents per day is a small sum for a useful citizen to live 
on, yet thousands of people are compelled to do so every year, 
and for these the following pages might be of assistance. 

Economical management, self-denial and abstinence from 
luxuries are the lessons to be studied. Look over the chapter 
on protein foods carefully. Never economize in these in order 
to buy cake, pastry or sweets. All who, for some reason or 
other, have to fight off starvation, will find that whole wheat 
bread and pure water or oatmeal porridge are the most perfect 
foods to keep them in fair health. They prevent diseases 
which might be the result of such conditions. To keep up on 
tea, coffee, sugar, white bread and liquor might result in dan- 
gerous breakdowns, insanity, murder and suicide. Coffee, tea 
and alcohol are medicines ; they are valuable at times for the 
sick, when the system cannot digest food, or under conditions 
where not sufficient natural food can be obtained. On such 
occasions they may prevent disease and death.

192 BOOKKEEPING. 

Knowledge of bookkeeping is a necessity for systematic 
homekeeping. The experience gained from a household book 
with careful planning for one year is of more value than the 
experience gained from five years of unsystematic housekeep- 
ing. Wise management of a home will enable a family with 
a moderate income to enjoy comforts and pleasures, of which 
a family in better circumstances, but with poor and unwise 
management, is deprived. 

"Time is money," therefore careful planning of the time that 
is expended for work, rest, recreation and outdoor life is as 
important as management of finances. Many women waste 
much valuable time with nonsensical details in the line of clean- 
ing, cooking and fancy sewing. This abnormal amount of 
manual work and neglect of mental development is generally 
followed by worry and poor health, as the result of an anemic 
brain. In those conditions mental healers perform miraculous 
c tires either by changing the activity of the mind or by paralyz- 
ing it to the extent of ignoring the plain facts of nature, and by 
denying the testimony of the senses. 

The modern household is full of unwholesome things, too 
many pictures, carpets, curtains and other ornaments, and too 
many salted, peppered, sugared and greasy artificial foods, with 
a lot of unnecessary dishes and utensils. A woman who enjoys 
spending all her time in drudgery, values herself below the 
poorest paid day-laborer. 

To save time and strength means investing time and strength 
on more important subjects, such as harmonious conversations, 
out of door exercise, attending lectures, and the teaching of the 
laws of health and hygiene to the young, which cannot be be- 
gun too early. Unsystematic management of household work 
and the care of children has broken up many a home.

Buy more starchy fruits, such as bananas, stone fruits, melons 
and raw vegetables ; combine them with toasted bread or raw 
cereal flakes. For those who eat two meals per day and have 
a late breakfast, it is better to combine fruits with nuts for 
breakfast in place of cereals. Use rich milk or cream with

RECIPES FOR MIXED BOILED DINNERS. 

They are much appreciated in many foreign countries by 
people of moderate means. The housekeeper who does her own 
work can save much time by introducing a few of these 
menus at her table. The preparation of foods in this manner 
requires less water, it is more of a steaming process, and fewer 
dishes and utensils are needed. 

Dishwashing becomes a burden in many a large household 
and the intelligent homekeeper studies economy in all direc- 
tions. 

I ask in advance that you try the recipes ; lay aside prejudice 
against some of the good old-fashioned dishes, to which you are 
not accustomed, and stop wasting your time over new and 
fashionable recipes that ruin, your health. Simplicity and 
knowledge are a great help for a low purse. 

I. 

LIMA BEANS WITH CARROTS AND POTATOES. 
Soak one pound of lima beans in rain or soft water over 
night, cook for half an hour, add salt, and then add five good 
sized carrots cut to the size of the beans. Cook both for half 
an hour, then add four or five potatoes and cook all together 
until done. Thicken the broth with corn starch, add chopped 
parsley and butter. A tablespoon of vinegar and sugar may be 
added to the sauce if the flavor is desired. The carrots may 
be cooked by themselves ; when done, add the water to the 
beans and potatoes, pour a little diluted vinegar over the car- 
rots, let .stand 20 minutes, drain off the vinegar and add the 
carrots to the beans and potatoes. This is preferable for people 
who dislike the sweet taste of the carrots. Serve with pork, 
bacon, frankfurters or without meat. Bread is not needed at 
this meal, as potatoes and carrots furnish sufficient carbo- 



MIXED BOILED DINNERS. 215 

hydrates. If bread is desired, it should be eaten in place of 
dessert with a little unsweetened black coffee or malt coffee. 

II. 

Small White or Brown Beans with Carrots and Potatoes.. 

Prepare the same as the foregoing. The time for cooking- 
beans depends on the quality. The carrots should not be added 
until the beans are nearly done. 

III. 

Dried Green Peas with Carrots and Pork. 
Prepare the same as the foregoing. Young green peas or 
string beans may be used in place of dried ones. The latter 
are excellent during the summer in combination, with salted 
pickled herring or creamed chipped beef. 

IV. 
Green Dried Peas with Dumplings. 

See recipe for bread or flour damplings. Cook the dump- 
lings in salted water and serve with the peas in place of meat 
or prepare a pea soup and boil the dumplings in the soup. This 
makes a perfect meal for dinner. 

Use one-fourth to one-half a cup of dried peas per person, 
according to size and age of the individual. Green fresh peas 
may be substituted in the summer. Fried bacon is a good ad- 
dition. 

Dumplings with Potatoes and Prunes. 

Steam the potatoes. Prepare some nutritious dumplings 
from flour or bread with eggs. Heat some butter, bacon fat or 
oil, add finely chopped onions, fry until brown, remove from 
the fire and add two tablespoons of syrup and some lemon 
juice or vinegar. Pour the potatoes and dumplings on a dish, 
mix with stewed cold or warm prunes, pour the syrup sauce 
over it and serve. Serve with lettuce. The syrup sauce can 
be thickened with flour and strengthened with the water in 
which the dumplings have been cooked ; the prune j-uice can be 
added in place of the syrup. Serve with fried bacon. Good 
during the summer. 



216 MIXED BOILED DINNERS. 

VI. 

Potatoes, Macaroni and Prunes. 

Cook the macaroni until very tender, drain, off the water, 
combine and serve in same manner as the foregoing. 

VII. 
Fried Dumplings. 

Cut left-over dumplings into thin, slices, fry in hot fat or 
butter until brown. Flavor with onions if desired. 



MEMORANDUM 



PART FOUR 

CHAPTER I. 

DISEASE. 

Disease is that condition of the body where there is any de- 
parture from the normal, in function, or structure. It may be 
local or general, and may tend to recovery, death or life-long 
suffering. 

Many so-called forms of dyspepsia are brought about by 
improper eating, or by eating when not hungry or when tired. 
In such cases, a regulated life and the right selection, combi- 
nation and preparation of foods is the only means to correct it. 

ULCERATION OF STOMACH AND INTESTINE. 

Causes : After effects from acute diseases, worry, envy, ex- 
cesses of eating or drinking, bony displacements, anemia and 
overwork. The patient should consult a physician at once. 
If certain areas of the glandular structure of stomach or intes- 
tine have been destroyed once, the normal structure cannot 
be restored; but with good care and proper dietetic measures 
great improvement can take place. Excess of starchy foods 
is always harmful. Particles of food not well masticated can 
cause much disturbance. The presence of fats in large amounts 
or wrongly combined with other foods will also retard diges- 
tion ; they cause the pyloric orifice to contract more, and leave 
the food contents in the stomach for a long time, and in this 
way cause fermentation, and putrefaction. 

Dyspepsia and indigestion are the beginnings of a dis- 
ordered metabolism and if neglected the results are: Nervous 
prostration, insanity, consumption, pelvic disorders, difficult 
child-birth, weak offspring, different forms of tumors and 
cancers and a multitude of fashionable and epidemic diseases. 



DISEASE. 219 

CONSTIPATION. 

The recognized rule is that the bowels should be evacuated 
once per day. Nevertheless, there are a number of people 
whose bowels act only every second or third day, and whose 
health is not impaired thereby. Healthy people who live on 
natural foods, such as raw fruits, nuts and grains, or on simple 
cooked foods with a moderate amount of meat, as a rule will 
not find it necessary to resort to artificial means for evacuation 
of the bowels. 

People, whose diet consists mainly of meats, cooked vege- 
tables and potatoes mixed with fermentable substances, or 
those who mix meat with milk and sweets or soft puddings will 
find it absolutely necessary to have a daily evacuation of the 
bowels, in order to retain perfect health. 

CHRONIC CONSTIPATION. 

Different habits of diet have a great effect upon evacuations. 
People who suffer from chronic constipation without any par- 
ticular ailment or disease may often be greatly benefited by 
adding a greater amount of fruits or vegetables to their diet. 
Others find it necessary to discard cooked fruits for a while 
and take oily substances. Some people are constipated from 
insufficient protein elements in, their food. The original cause 
may have been mechanical obstruction. Morbid anatomy 
and morbid physiology go hand in hand. Therefore, if proper 
hygiene and diet does not correct the condition, the patient 
should consult a physician for special treatment. 

MALARIA. 

Malaria is a germ disease, but like many other germ dis- 
eases, the primary cause is lowered resistance, caused by 
poisoned air and adulterated food stuffs. Protection against 
adulterated food stuffs depends upon enforcement of pure- 
food laws, and the training of every housekeeper in the art of 
domestic science. Impure milk, whether poisoned by the 



220 DISEASE. 

milkmen or handled carelessly by the housekeeper, can-not 
be turned into good blood. The same is true of other food 
stuffs. 

Dry, pure air is absolutely necessary for the patient who 
suffers with malaria. Dwelling places near which are stag- 
nant pools, rain barrels, marsh land or stores where decayed 
fruits and vegetables are housed, are dangerous to people who 
are afflicted with malaria or any other germ disease. Mos- 
quitoes are held responsible for both malaria and yellow fever. 
They breed in warm weather, wherever stagnant water is 
found. To prevent a disease that is spread by animal or vege- 
table parasites we must direct our effort against the breeding 
places of these disease carriers. Coal oil, poured upon the 
surface of stagnant water on streets, or near our homes, is a 
great help in preventing the multiplication of mosquitoes. 
Screens on dwelling houses, dry basements, plenty of sunshine 
in the home and the prevention of accumulation of vegetable 
refuse can do much toward protection from these parasites. 

People who are afflicted with partial congestion of the portal 
circulation have stagnant and poisoned blood, and are more 
liable to contract malaria than those whose liver is in good 
working order. Many people are under the impression that 
they have liver trouble if they put more work upon this organ 
than it is able to do. Overtaxing of any part of the body will 
finally result in congestion and disease. 

If mechanical obstructions are responsible for sluggish con- 
ditions of the liver, they should be remedied by anatomical 
and physiological adjustment. Deep breathing is of the great- 
est importance in all diseases affecting the abdominal organs. 
Fresh air at night is as important as during the day. During 
rainy weather have a fire going during the night in order to 
keep the air dry. Protect the body with warmer clothing after 
sunset, and wear light woolen underwear if necessary to avoid 
chills during sleep. 

The diet should be light and nutritious. Avoid all rich con- 
diments, spices, soft puddings containing milk and eggs, yeast 
breads and cakes. Some cases should avoid milk, cheese, shell- 
fish and other foods rich in protein. 



DISEASE. 221 

THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS MAY BE HELP- 
FUL TO INVALIDS WHO SUFFER FROM CHRON- 
IC AFFECTIONS OF THE LIVER AND 
INTESTINAL INDIGESTION. 

1. Spend at least four hours per day out of doors. 

2. Take short walks before and after dinner and before and 
after supper. Take deep breathing exercises by open win- 
dows before breakfast, and exercise the lower limbs while 
in bed. 

3. Have breakfast at 9 a. m. and supper between 4 and 5 p. m. 

4. Never work or eat when, the hands and feet are cold. 

5. Relax and breathe deeply with face down for 20 minutes, 
three times per day before meals. 

6. During damp or rainy weather rest more, eat more greens, 
citrus fruits and fatty foods, and little or none of those 
foods which are rich in protein, such as cheese, whites of 
eggs, lean meats, nuts, beans, canned corn and milk foods, 
and select protein foods for the noon meal in the form of 
green pea or lentil soup, with or without tomatoes, or fat 
cold pork, fish or bacon in combination with apples, mashed 
beets, carrots or yellow turnips with lemon, hard yolks of 
eggs and fried bacon. Rice with tomato sauce and cold fat 
meat is also good. Black stale bread is best. 

7. For Breakfast use fats in the form of mayonnaise dressing 
with raw apples and tomatoes and plenty of onions, also 
fat meat if desired, and corn meal mush with eggs and 
cranberry sauce and celery; or the above mentioned green 
leaf vegetables. Celery roots, raw or cooked, with lemon 
and toasted bread and butter or fried bacon is also good. 
Use raw carrots, cranberries and beets with greens and 
French dressing. Raw cabbage is also good. 

8. For supper select your food according to your appetite. If 
you are warm, active and energetic, take some raw fresh 
milk with zwieback and tomato or cranberry juice, or suck 
the juice of one-half or one-fourth of a lemon or grape- 
fruit with it, white and yellow skin and all, expectorate the 
residue. Bran tea, barley or oatmeal water with one-fourth 



222 DISEASE. 

sterilized cream is good. If you are cold and chilly eat a 
plate of warm soup made of tomatoes or plums, huckle- 
berries, string beans or asparagus (treated with lemon), 
or potato soup, or eat green cooked leaf vegetables with 
lemon and fried bacon, toasted or puffed wheat, and butter. 
9. During the dry, frosty season, when the sun is bright dur- 
ing the middle of the day, eat a moderate amount of those 
foods forbidden under No. 6, combine them rightly, and 
take walks in the sunshine after dinner. 

1C. Mornings and evenings eat about the same foods as sug- 
gested in the foregoing. 

11. Dress the body according to the changes of temperature. 

12. Avoid over-heated rooms, and stay in bed until the sun 
rises, if necessary. 

13. Keep the bowels in good order by enemas. 

14. Black malt coffee prepared with a few whole or crushed 
coffee beans is of medicinal value if taken in small quanti- 
ties after meals, especially after the noon meal; it acts as 
a tonic to the liver. Law cranberries may be substituted 
if desired. 

The above mentioned suggestions are for extreme cases of 
liver degeneration. They also apply to many chronic, so- 
called incurable diseases w r here the protein and starches of the 
diet should be limited in quantity to the minimum, compatible 
with the requirements of the individual. 

There are cases of liver trouble where there is no interfer- 
ence with the glycogenic and oxidizing action of the liver, 
and where an, entirely different diet is required. Therefore, no 
patient should attempt to treat a disease by a book, without 
having his case diagnosed by a physician and receiving advice 
as to the special diet required. 



DISEASE. 223 

TUBERCULOSIS. 

Itisoneof the mostfatal diseases that affects men and animals. 
It is due to a germ called the bacillus of tuberculosis. This 
germ, however, is not the primary cause for the development 
of the disease. Wrong environment, unclean air and food are 
the causes that multiply these germs. Hereditary weaknesses 
play an important part, but the disease itself is never inher- 
ited. Low r ered vitality, infection through milk and meat, and 
careless spitting are in a large measure responsible. 

Children of parents who suffer from tuberculosis may grow 
up into healthy and strong individuals, if the proper conditions 
are furnished. Tendencies to disease are universally manifest 
in the weaker structures, and this weaker resisting power is 
the exact measure of the power inherent in heredity. 

Tuberculosis may affect the lungs or manifest itself in dif- 
ferent parts of the body, and is known under the following 
names: Potts disease or curvature of the spine; hip joint dis- 
ease, when it affects the hip joint ; white swelling or knee joint 
disease; ankle joint disease; lupus or skin disease; scrofula, 
when it affects the glands of the neck; tuberculous ulceration, 
when it affects the inside of the intestine ; tuberculous peritoni- 
tis, when it affects the outside of the intestine; and consump- 
tion, when the lungs are involved. 

PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS. 
The House We Live In. 

Sunlight is the best known disinfectant. The direct rays 
of the sun destroy tubercular germs and the majority of other 
micro-organisms. Plants cannot grow without sunshine. Hu- 
man beings cannot enjoy health in dark dwelling places, with- 
out sulight. The houses we live in should contain a large 
number of windows and glass doors, so as to permit all rooms 
to be permeated with sunlight. It is a pity that modern 
houses, with all their conveniences and sanitary arrangements, 
have so little provision for proper sterilization by sunlight. 

Many new modern houses are provided with a lot of un- 



224 DISEASE. 

necessary closet room, pantries and double stairways, halls 
and other accessories, which shut up impure air and prevent 
proper ventilation. Instead of living in large, luxurious 
houses, our health and comfort could be greatly improved by 
the investment of more space in artistically constructed gar- 
dens. Smaller houses, long and narrow in form, or wide and 
short, according to the location, and size of the lot, could be 
daily disinfected and sterilized from cellar to attic by the 
rays of the glorious sun. A building of this kind may consist 
of two, four, eight, ten or more rooms, with one or three 
floors, and can offer comfort for one family, or be divided 
into apartments or flats. A house should be built on porous 
ground. 

A lower floor, with parlor and spare bedrooms, is more easily 
ventilated and kept clean than a high basement with poor 
flooring, and no provision for proper airing or the admission 
of sunlight. 

The mother of a family who has to do her own work in a 
two-story house could save much time and strength by having 
her kitchen and dining room on the upper floor, with hall and 
stairway and glass door in the center of the house, which 
would enable her to attend to the door from above. A house 
so constructed could easily be provided with porches for sleep- 
ing, and a place for the children to play during the morning 
hours, and in this way relieve the mother of many unnecessary 
steps. 

Large, beautiful gardens call for work which is mixed with 
brains, while large houses with fashionable accessories call 
for slavery and compel one woman to become the servant of 
another woman. 

All human beings are born with a pair of arms, which by 
gradual development enable them to care for their bodies in 
matters of feeding, dressing, hygiene and comforts. Assistants 
in the home are required for the child, the sick and the help- 
less. 

Modern inventions relieve us partly of house-cleaning and 
laundry work, and modern methods of simple feeding and 
luxurious airing will relieve us from solving the servant prob- 
lem and prevent diseases that are created by wrong living. 



DISEASE. 225 

TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS. 

Clinical experience with hygiene and diet have proved that 
they are the most important factors in the treatment of dis- 
ease. 

A certain class of patients who are in the early stages of this 
disease may be benefited by a liberal diet, but the larger percent- 
age of sufferers really have indigestion and can only gain bene- 
fit by cutting down their diet and by living upon plain, non- 
stimulating food. The amount of carbo-hydrate foods should 
be decreased and the amount of fats increased. Olive oil in 
combination with raw vegetables, acid fruits and raw eggs 
and fat meats should be given daily. They are best taken for 
breakfast. The heavier protein foods should be eaten at the 
noon meal in combination with a small amount of cereals and 
raw greens. The evening meal should consist of broths with 
e ggV cooked green vegetables, toast and bacon, or of milk 
foods. If extra milk is required it should be given with a 
keen appetite. Food eaten without relish cannot be properly 
oxidized and assimilated. 

People who are compelled to work while sick should take 
some extra milk between 10 and 12 a. m. and during the after- 
noon. Milk may be taken raw or boiled, according to the jn- 
dividual requirements. The bowels should be kept in order 
by enemas and laxative foods. 

RICKETS. 

This is a condition where there is interference with the 
nutrition of the bones. The bones, like other parts of the 
body, are injured by lack of nourishment; they become soft 
and yielding like wax, and are drawn by the muscles into de- 
formity. The animal matter which enters into the composition 
of the skeleton is in great excess, and the earthy (or mineral 
matter) is deficient in proportion. Causes for such conditions 
are: Lack of lime and minerals in. the food, before or after 
birth ; impure or inferior milk ; fermenting foods ; excess of 
starchy foods, sweets and meats ; insufficient greens, legumes 
and nut-foods in the mother's food, and overwork of the mother 
before or after birth of the child ; damp and impure air and un- 



226 DISEASE. 

healthy dwellings. The first symptoms of this disease or a 
tendency to it can sometimes be detected in a child during the 
first year by soft and flabby muscles, excess of fat, difficulty 
and backwardness of learning to walk, and in cutting teeth, 
extremely narrow chest, continual digestive disturbances with 
constipation, or greenish looking evacuations, and catarrh of 
the bowels. Softening of the bones of the head is often pres- 
ent. . 

The prevention and treatment of this disease demands care- 
ful regulation of the diet, sufficient sleep, pure air, dry, sunny 
dwellings, warm baths, massage and salt rubs. If the child 
perspires much on the upper part of the body during sleep, 
avoid feather pillows and keep the lower limbs warm by arti- 
ficial heat if necessary. Avoid pressure on the head by placing 
a narrow pillow about two inches in width under the neck, and 
no pillow^ under the head. Keep the child in the lying position 
as much as possible. Do not carry it on the arm except when 
necessary, and never force it to stand or walk against its own 
will. 

The diet should consist of milk and cream with well cooked 
strained pearl barley and steel cut oats or bran, a moderate 
amount of toast, calfs-foot jelly, eggs strained legumes and 
fat meats. Raw greens, fruits and nuts should be given, as 
soon as the child is able to digest them without difficulty. Al- 
ways select the food in the right combination and never allow 
excesses of any kind. The bowels must be kept regular by 
enemas. 

OBESITY. 

Obesity is a constitutional disease, due to excess of food in 
general or to excess of wrong food and interference with the 
nerve supply controlling the oxidation processes. 

Thousands of people who suffer from this "fat habit" could 
cure themselves by proper attention to hygiene and diet. A 
normal individual who lives right, thinks right and is engaged 
in useful work, does not need to carry useless fat around with 
him. 

Do not take the advice of a friend who promises relief with 
dangerous drugs and salves, or excessive steam-baths and 



DISEASE. 227 

violent exercises. A diet suitable in quality and quantity to 
the particular constitution, useful- activity, alternated with 
sufficient rest and recreation, and plenty of sunlight and dry, 
fresh air, are the only means to bring permanent results. A 
change of occupation is necessary at times. The dry diet, con- 
sisting of the necessary amount of proteins, with a large 
amount of raw greens or fruits and fats, and abstinence from 
tea and coffee and foods which are rich in starch and sugar, 
will bring relief to the majority of people who have a tendency 
tc grow stout. 

There are special conditions which require special treat- 
ment, such as tonic baths, massage, sun-baths, osteopathic 
treatments and special prescribed diets and exercises which 
cannot be discussed here. 



CHAPTER II. 
CARE AND FEEDING OF CONVALESCENTS. 

Convalescence depends much upon the proper food. Fevers 
require that the patient's strength should be kept up. If the 
body has been overfed on certain articles, these must be 
stopped, and those elements which are needed must be admin- 
istered in the form of food, water, air and so on. The fever 
is nature's method of throwing off disease, and if properly 
guided it does not become dangerous. A physician should be 
sent for at once. The diet prescribed for the patient and the 
directions in regard to quantity, temperature and time of ad- 
ministration should be carried out in every detail, just like 
other directions in regard to nursing. Many a patient has 
been, seriously injured or even killed through the administra- 
tion of foods which were forbidden by the doctor. At times 
there is a special desire for a particular kind of food. It may 
be an indication that the system requires it, and such craving 
should always be reported to the doctor, and if possible the 
physician will suggest such a food or some substitute which 
will answer the purpose. 

The temperature of the food should be tested before serving. 
Blood warm is generally the best. The tray should not be 
loaded with a variety of foods. The patient should not be 
tempted with food unless forced feeding is indicated. 

If the tongue is coated, give a little water with lemon juice 
before breakfast, especially if milk foods are to be eaten. If 
the appetite is not keen, do not take milk foods for breakfast. 

VOMITING. 

If vomiting occurs or is continued for any length of time, 
it may be checked by giving cold weak tea or black coffee at 
frequent intervals, or a few drops of brandy in a tablespoonful 
of ice water. In many cases it is better for the patient to have 
his breakfast in bed for some time after recovery, especially 
if the exertion of dressing is tiresome or the temperature of the 



DIET FOR THE SICK. 229 

room is unsuited to the patient's condition. A mild warm 
room is preferable to an overheated one. 

DIET. 

Diet for the sick may be classified as liquid, semi-liquid and 
solid foods. A liquid diet is generally given only during acute 
illness or after operations. The kind of food, as well as the 
amount and intervals at which it should be given, are usually 
prescribed by the attending physician. Therefore, only a few 
suggestions are given. 

If nourishment by enema is necessary, predigested sub- 
stances are the best ; peptonized milk and malt extracts or well 
prepared, strained gruels of bran and oats, or of bran alone, to 
which one to two teaspoonsful of brandy have been added. 
Black sereal coffee or weak black coffee are often excellent 
where stimulation is desired. The amount should be from one 
to three ounces at a time, and the temperature should be luke 
warm. It must be injected very slowly. 

If the patient is of a nervous temperament, or suffers from 
irritability of the stomach, he should have as little animal food 
as possible, especially for breakfast. As a rule a well prepared 
water gruel satisfies the demands of the body until the noon 
hour. It acts as a sedative and rests the whole body, and in 
this way more nervous energy can be expended for digestion 
at the noon meal. 

There are some exceptions ; for example, if a patient has 
had a restless night and is exhausted, he may have a cupful of 
freshly prepared whey or bran-tea with milk or cream before 
his breakfast. As a rule such conditions should not appear 
during convalescence, and may be prevented by intelligent 
nursing and avoidance of unnecessary company. 

The greatest care should be taken not to allow a patient to 
eat rapidly or to take large quantities at one time, and also 
to avoid foods which produce fermentation.

MEMORANDUM 



PART FOUR 



APPENDIX. 

MENTAL HYGIENE AND DIET. 

Proper growth and activity of the brain and nervous system 
are promoted by a healthy flow of blood. Pure air and suffi- 
cient protein food properly combined and proportioned with 
carbo-hydrate and fatty foods, rich in prosphates and minerals, 
are essential. Choose more of the lighter form of protein and 
starchy foods, as fish, eggs, almonds, green peas, bacon, a mod- 
erate amount of lamb and beef, rice, sago, wheat, and vege- 
table gelatines. Foods rich in minerals are celery, apples, 
tomatoes, greens, oranges, and practically all the fresh fruits 
and vegetables, especially the small berries. Melons and 
starchy vegetables in large quantities are suitable for muscular 
workers. Use as little as possible of so-called pure chemical 
substances, such as refined sugar and flour. 

Avoid poisonous beverages, tobacco and all forms of drugs. 
Sleep at least nine hours in a well ventilated room, facing east 
or south. Avoid constipation. Combine mental work with 
moderate amounts of useful and enjoyable exercise, or physical 
work. Protect the eyes from strong artificial light. Keep the 
feet warm. Relax before and after meals. A certain amount 
of manual labor is absolutely necessary for the brain-worker. 
It favors deep breathing and creates a demand for more air 
and water, and thus improves digestion, oxidation and nutri- 
tion. The body poisons are carried off quicker and nervous 
headaches and despondency are avoided. Short walks out of 
doors before retiring are very beneficial for people who suffer 
with cold hands and feet. 

"THE IMMIGRANT." 

All who leave the land of their birth should make themselves 
acquainted with the art of living and the peculiarities of the 
new country in which they intend to live. 



246 THE IMMIGRANT. 

To depart entirely from their old customs and habits is as 
dangerous as to neglect the study of the new environment or 
the failure to adopt necessary changes. 

In some States the climatic conditions of the United States 
are very changeable; we have extreme heat and cold, and 
excess of rain with wind storms and dryness changing within 
a short time. West of the Rocky Mountains we have a mild 
sea air. In the Southern States and near the Pacific Coast we 
have low districts where malaria and catarrhal conditions are 
easily acquired. 

Tropical fruits and vegetables which are looked upon as lux- 
uries in Northern Europe are necessary articles of food in the 
country where they grow, therefore the stranger should make 
himself acquainted with such foods and by degrees learn to 
eat them. 

In countries where the days are extremely hot and the 
nights are cold, the selection of foods should be made accord- 
ingly. Fats produce more than twice the amount of energy 
than carbo-hydrates, therefore they are more suitable during 
the early part of the day. During the middle of the day 
select foods of the protein class, in proper proportion with 
fruits and raw greens. For the evening meal use the stimu- 
lating sub-acid and sweet fruits in combination with light 
protein and cereal foods. 



HEALTH HINTS FOR BUSY PEOPLE. 

1. Keep the feet warm, the head cool and the stomach not 
too full. 

2. Take walks out of doors daily and breathe deeply. 

3. Do not wear tight shoes or tight corsets. 

4. Masticate your food thoroughly. Select, combine and 
prepare it rightly. Do not overeat. 

5. Avoid fresh breads, inferior cakes and pastry. 

6. Do not eat unless you are hungry. 

7. Do not over-indulge in athletic or any other kind of ex- 
ercise. 

8. Remember that natural feeding, pure air and sufficient 
sleep call for natural breathing and natural exercise. 

9. Unnatural feeding and late hours create disease or ner- 
vousness. 

10. Don't take drugs for sleeplessness. 

11. Tired feeling in the morning is the result of nerve 
starvation and auto-intoxication. 

12. The house we live in should be constructed for health 
and comfort, rather than for style. 

13. Sleep by open windows. Night air is as pure as day air. 
Protect yourself from dampness by an open fire if necessary. 

14. Do not dress and wash in a cold bath room. Have your 
wash bowl in. the bed room. 

15. Sewer gas from a small pipe in a well ventilated bed 
room is not harmful, as it is carried off in the air. Have the 
stopper placed in the hole when not in use. 

16. Dress by an open fire or in a sunny room. A chill 
before breakfast produces indigestion and a desire for unnec- 
essary hot foods. 

17. Never sleep by night lamps or any other artificial light. 
They are injurious to the eyes and absorb oxygen. 

18. Teach a growing child that selecting and preparing his 
food is an important occupation. 

19. Do not allow a child to fill his body with trash. 

20. Pure water is as important as pure food. If you boil 
your water the minerals are deposited on the bottom of the 
kettle instead of in the system for bone-making material. 



248 HEALTH HINTS. 

21. Milk is a food, not a drink; it should never be taken in 
addition to, or at the end of, a heavy meal. 

22. Many people object to boiled milk on account of a 
theory that it tends to constipate. Do not dwell on theories; 
find out the effect for yourself. Potatoes, toast and many other 
cooked foods are constipating also. Why not object to those? 

23. Raw foods are more nutritious than cooked foods, if 
they are pure and fresh and can be digested without difficulty. 

24. A change from cooked to raw foods might produce 
diarrhoea or constipation. The latter condition is generally 
not dangerous. Constipation from cooked foods is more dan- 
gerous. 

25. A daily evacuation of the bowels is not always a sign 
that the stomach and intestines are in good working order. 
The bowels can be forced to move by the eating of too rich 
foods. 

26. Some people are clearer in mind on a vegetarian diet, 
while upon others it has no such effect at all. 

27. A healthy individual does not need to confine himself 
to a special system of diet. Avoid dangerous experiments car- 
lied on for orthodox reasons. 

28. Rich soaky cooked nut foods are not health foods. If 
you want to be a vegetarian, live on raw foods. 

29. Some people thrive on raw foods while others do not. 
The best time to begin with raw foods is in childhood. 

30. Hot house plants cannot digest raw foods. Open, your 
doors and windows and learn to breathe first. Fresh air and 
sunshine are necessary for the change of food. 

31. If your teeth are poor, substitute a food-chopper or 
grinder for your foods. 

32. The most perfect foods, such as apples, tomatoes, wheat, 
oats, rye, legumes and nuts seldom disagree with a healthy 
individual, provided they are used wisely. 

33. Sunlight is a great disinfectant. Dark rooms are a 
breeding place for tuberculous germs. 

34. Daily out-of-door exercise in the sunshine will increase 
health and reduce the coal bill. Without exercise our food 
can be of little benefit to us. 



HEALTH HINTS. 249 

35. By natural feeding, overwork is not possible. The body 
demands rest when its strength is exhausted. 

36. Artificial stimulants are deceivers. They make a man 
feel strong when he is weak. They produce artificial heat an.d 
will-power and an abnormal temperature; they lead to over- 
work, abnormal development and degenerate brains and bodies. 

37. Natural will-power can direct its force wherever it is 
wanted, be it for work or rest; it can sustain on bread and 
water for many days. 

38. Without substance there can be no power. Substantial 
food, fresh air, water and natural exercise develop strong 
bodies and minds. 

39. Artificial sweets, white bread and poisonous beverages 
develop butterflies that crave excitement and artificial life. 

40. The world is full of people that are without substance, 
power or principle. They earn their living the easiest way they 
can. Wrong feeding is responsible for such conditions. 

41. Social reformers and humanitarians cannot solve prob- 
lems until they have learned how to feed the race. 

42. Many people are under the impression that if a certain 
food is recommended as especially healthful, over-indulgence 
must be beneficial. 

43. All natural foods are wholesome; over-eating produces 
discomfort and disease. 

44. Some fruits and vegetables have high medicinal values. 
Specific foods prescribed in large quantities are useful for cer- 
tain ailments, but not for a healthy individual. 

45. Each individual is a law unto himself. Two different 
people afflicted with a disease of the same name may require 
entirely different treatment. Human beings cannot be stan- 
dardized like inert machines. 

46. Canned fruits out of season are not a necessary article 
of food ; they are of value as a medicine. 

47. If certain foods do not agree, or produce indigestion, 
study their combination and preparation carefully, also the 
proportion, and time of the day when most suitable. If this 
does not prove satisfactory, leave them alone. 

48. Don't buy cheap or inferior food of any kind. 



250 HEALTH HINTS. 

49. Don't always believe your dealer as to the quality of 
the product. Investigate for yourself. 

50. Don't use fruits in excess if you lead a very active life. 
The right proportion is the key note to maintain balance. 

51. Excessive fruits and rest is a prescription for sickness. 

52. If no great hunger is felt at a meal, do not eat nuts or 
any kind of foods classed as protein. Neither stuff yourself 
with liquid foods. A fast or fruits or fruit juices are the best 
under such conditions. 

53. Do not offer a guest more food than he desires. It may 
be polite, but it is an unwholesome fashion. 

54. Drink sufficient pure natural water between your 
meals. There is danger in over-drinking as well as in under- 
drinking. 

55. A definite employment, practical and loving sympathy 
with our fellow men and faith in the almighty power of crea- 
tion is a good prescription for imaginary diseases. 

56. There is a great medicinal force in. a mind of peace. If 
you suffer from chronic ailments brought on by overwork, 
seek rest and solitude, and exercise your soul. The latent 
powers within you can be awakened by right study. Give up 
wrong thoughts and habits. 

57. Hard arteries are the result of high-pressure life. 

58. Restlessness and sleeplessness are the result of an acid 
or toxic condition of the blood. 

59. The liver is the great filter and germ destroyer of the 
body. Co-operate with nature and treat your liver right. 
Germs are not attracted to healthy people. 

60. Many lung diseases are often the result of an abused 
liver. 

61. Mouth-breathing is the result of structural and function- 
al derangement. 

62. Children that are allowed to sit with cold feet in the 
school room cannot keep their health or study their lessons. 

63. A destructive or mischievous child can be corrected by 
proper food and sufficient suitable employments. 

64. Defective teeth and eyesight are often the result of 
improper feeding. Glasses cannot make up the deficiency. 



HEALTH HINTS. 251 

65. Cleanse the mouth and teeth on arising and after each 
meal. 

66. If you wish to prevent colds, stop overloading your 
stomach. 



HYGIENE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 

The pantry shelf with its contents is responsible for many 
acute diseases and ptomaine poisoning by unhygienic and care- 
less handling and preservation of foodstuffs. 

A closet for the preservation of food should be located on 
the north or east side of the house if possible. It should 
have several long and narrow windows from top to bottom, 
so as to allow plenty of air and light. The shelves should be 
constructed of wire, zinc or wooden slats, and be removable. 

Raw fruits and vegetables should never be kept in the same 
closet with cooked food. Milk and butter should not be kept 
near meat or other cooked foods. Potatoes, carrots and under- 
ground vegetables should be kept out of doors or in a dry 
basement. They may be preserved in a box with dry sand. 

Onions should not be left in. a paper bag; hang them up in 
the sun or keep them in a flat box in a dry place. Onions 
vhich have been cut should never be used again for food, 
unless the cut side has been, preserved in vinegar or oil. 

All raw foods which have a thick skin have better keeping 
qualities than those with a thin skin; therefore, fancy summer 
fruits should be eaten while fresh on the same day they were 
picked. No more should be bought than can be eaten the 
same day, or else they should be preserved by sterilization.. 

Green vegetables should be used fresh if possible, and not 
kept longer than three or four days. Never keep them in 
the house or pantry. 

Apples or other winter fruits should be kept in a dry store 
room out of doors, in the attic or in a dry basement. 

The white film that often, gathers around grapes is a breed- 
ing place for diphtheria germs. Wash thoroughly before eat- 
ing all fruits which have been stored in houses or at the 
market. Do not prepare more raw food than can be eaten 
at one meal. Never allow it to stand after it is cut. 



252 HYGIENE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 

Many housekeepers think it important to scald their dishes, 
but do not know that it is far more important to sterilize or 
reboil cooked foods which have stood on the shelf for 18 or 24 
hours and sometimes longer. Such foodstuff is dangerous 
long before the process of fermentation can be detected by the 
sense of smell or taste. 

Some foods begin to undergo changes immediately after 
cooling; therefore, cooked foods left over, with the exception 
of a few, should be reboiled before serving again. Rice or 
other cereals should be stirred over the fire for a while and then 
baked in the oven until they are thoroughly sterile. The 
care of milk has been discussed in the chapter on food. Soups 
which are preserved with fat will keep wholesome for several 
days without reboiling. Fruits and fruit juices should not 
stand longer than 24 hours. Eggs are best preserved in bran 
or lime-water or on ice if kept for a week or longer. Boiled 
or thoroughly roasted meats will keep wholesome -for 36 
hours in a cold place. During the summer meat should not be 
kept from one day to another. 

If left-over meat is cut from the bone and cooked up in 
gravy or soup stock or preserved in gelatine (with fat to cover 
it), it can be kept wholesome for 4 or 5 days and longer, ac- 
cording to the manner of preservation. Half cooked chops 
and beefsteak should never be kept in the same manner they 
are served. They should be cooked thoroughly in fat or gravy 
before being put away. All meats should be freshly cut 
and cooked the same day after delivery, or be preserved by 
partly cooking or roasting, until the next day. Many house- 
keepers keep roasts, chops and beefsteak until it looks blue 
and green with putrefaction before it is cooked. Never buy 
meat which has an unnatural color. Be sure that your butcher 
does not use poisonous substances to keep the meat from de- 
composition. Visit your butcher often and investigate how 
often he gets a fresh supply of meat. This is of more benefit 
than to save time by telephoning. 

Never allow sliced bacon to lie in the ice box or pantry 
for several days. It becomes rancid and is unfit for food. Buy 
your bacon in bulk and slice it with a sharp knife when wanted. 



HYGIENE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 253 

Do not keep sliced meat of any kind longer than one day in 
cold weather. Do not keep it in hot weather without pre- 
serving it in gravy or fat or by sterilization. 

Do not keep a tight cover on a dish, jar or bottle which con- 
tains raw or cooked food, unless the air within is sterile. 

Allow cooked food to stand open until it is cool, then put 
the cover over two-thirds of its opening or cover with a cheese- 
cloth or a colander. 

If milk or cream is delivered in bottles, remove the cover 
immediately after delivery. If the air where it stands is dusty, 
protect the milk with cotton or cheese-cloth. Treat boiled 
milk in the same manner. 

Cooked foods which have poor keeping qualities should not 
be kept for further use, or no more should be prepared than 
can be eaten, at one meal. To this class belong cooked under- 
ground or leaf vegetables, custards, soft puddings, milk and 
egg foods and gelatines. Damp or rainy weather is more 
favorable for decomposition of foodstuffs than dry weather. 

Whites of eggs should not be kept longer than 18 or 24 
hours. They must be preserved in a very cold place and be 
utilized at the earliest opportunity. They are like all proteins, 
more dangerous than starches if left to ferment, whether the 
fermentation begins on the pantry shelf or in the stomach. 
White of egg can be used in many different ways. It may be 
beaten to a froth and served on fruit-soups or fruit pies, or it 
can be taken in place of broth at the beginning of a meal. 
Add a tablespoon of water and a few drops of lemon, or orange 
or apple or cranberry juice to one white of an egg and beat up 
with a fork, or drink without beating. White of egg can also 
be utilized for brancakes. 

If a variety of left-over food is on hand which cannot be 
combined into one dish, it is better to serve different food to 
each member rather than to divide each article for all; the 
latter custom may be more polite, but it is not wise to mix a 
great variety of foods at one meal. 

Left-over skim-milk is best utilized for cheese, pancakes, 
whey gruel, whey or milk sauce, or be boiled and served with 
stale rye or corn bread. Vegetables prepared with milk do 
not make a good combination. Soft puddings prepared with 



254 HYGIENE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 

skim-milk, sugar and eggs, are not very wholesome unless 
the necessary amount of fat is added in the form of butter or 
suet. Skim-milk and fruit is not a good combination. 

Left-over potatoes can be utilized in many different ways : 
for fish-cakes, pancakes, hash, potato-dumplings, creamed pota- 
toes or for salad. Fried cooked potatoes are not a good food 
for the noon meal, especially for children or people doing active 
work. 

Baked legumes if preserved with fat meat or oil can be kept 
on hand for a week and be rebaked two or three times per 
week. 

PRESERVATION OF EGGS FOR THE WINTER. 

Put one layer of common salt or bran one inch deep on the 
bottom of a wooden pail or washtub. Then grease the eggs 
with parafine or oil and place them with the small end down, 
so that they will not touch the bottom of the tub. Fill with 
enough salt to cover the eggs one inch. 

PRESERVATION OF EGGS. No. 2. 

Preserve the eggs with salicylic acid, which can be bought 
in the drug store. Follow directions on package. 

CHILDREN. 

A child should have his face and hands washed before an-d 
after each meal. He should not be allowed to carry foodstuffs 
and candy about the house, or touch carpets and furniture 
with sticky and greasy fingers. If he requires food between, 
meals, give him four, or five meals per day, but have him eat 
his food in the proper place. 

The breeding of flies, mosquitoes and other disease carriers 
is greatly favored by allowing children to eat at any and all 
times without napkins or special preservation of their dress or 
without cleaning their hands before and after eating or before 
and after playing with animals and pets. 

The American child is given too much consideration at the 
table. There is a great difference between the saying "I don't 
like a certain food" and "I don't want it," because there are 
things which taste better. 



HYGIENE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 255 

To leave one's plate half full of foodstuffs and ask for or 
accept another food is fashionable, but before the law of our 
Creator it is unclean and disrespectful. 

The physiological laws of our bodies are based on. very 
economical plans ; nature utilizes everything and wastes noth- 
ing. Cooked foodstuffs, whether they are wasted within our 
bodies by over-indulgence, or in the garbage can, create de- 
composition and germs. 

Cooked green foods and mushes are neither wholesome foods 
for chickens or pet animals. Natural food is dry, and animals 
which are fed on dry food produce a better quality of milk, 
eggs and flesh than animals which are fed upon slops. 



DISHWASHING. 

Dishwashing is a work which takes up so much time in 
every household, that it is a subject which should receive some 
attention. 

The housekeeper who serves a considerable amount of raw 
food saves much time and strength by relieving herself of 
greasy dishes and saucepans. 

Scrape off the fragments from plates and utensils an-d pre- 
pare one basin with hot soapsuds and another with rinsing 
water of clear hot or cold water. People whose time is valua- 
ble can save much work by placing the dishes from the drain- 
board upside down, on a shelf prepared from wooden slats, or 
set them in a wire basket and let them dry without wiping. 

If the dishes are not washed immediately after each meal, 
place the silverware and knives in a high bowl or quart meas- 
ure and let them soak in hot or cold water. Remove all foods 
from metallic utensils immediately after the meal is over. 
Never allow metallic spoons to stand in. fruit sauce, salt or 
in any kind of prepared food. Acids dissolve metal and in this 
way may produce poisoning. 

In contagious diseases all dishes should be sterilized. Burn 
up all particles of left-over food, put the dishes into a narrow 
pail and boil with plenty of water and soda for an hour or 
longer. 



256 HYGIENE ECONOMY AND SANITATION. 

DISINFECTION OF EXCRETA. 

Use solutions of carbolic acid or chloride of lime. Mix with 
equal quantities of the excreta and allow it to stand for several 
hours before it is disposed of. 

WHITEWASH FOR WOODWORK. 

Soak one-fourth of a pound of glue in cold water over night. 
Dissolve some lime with cold water, add a few handsful of salt. 
Heat the glue until it is dissolved and add to one bucket of 
whitewash. This makes a smooth and healthy paint. Use 
for rough or smooth woodwork, twice per year in laundry, 
basement or cellar or pantry.

a Plain confectionery not containing nuts, fruit, or chocolate. 

b Such vegetables as potatoes, squash, beets, etc., have a certain amount of inedible 
material, skin, seeds, etc. The amount varies with the method of preparing the vegetables, 
and cannot be accurately estimated. The figures given for refuse of vegetables, fruits, 
etc., are assumed to represent approximately the amtount of refuse in these foods as 
ordinarily prepared. 

C Fruits contain a certain proportion of inedible materials, as skins, seeds, etc.. which 
are properly classed as refuse. In some fruits, as oranges and prunes, the amount re- 
jected in eating is practically the same as refuse. In others, as apples and pears, more or 
less of the edible material is ordinarily rejected with the skin and seeds and other inedible 
portions. The edible material which is thus thrown away, and should properly be classed 
with the waste, is here classed with the refuse. The figures for refuse here given repre- 
sent, as nearly as can be ascertained, the quantities ordinarily rejected.

b The average of five analyses of cereal coffee grain is: Water 6.2, protein 13.3, fat 
3.4, carbohydrates 72.6, and ash 4.5 per cent. Only a portion of the nutrients, however, 
enter into the infusion. The average in the table represents the available nutrients in the 
beverage. Infusions of genuine coffee and of tea like the above contain practically no 
nutrients.
