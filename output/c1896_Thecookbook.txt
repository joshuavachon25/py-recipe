Preface. 

In placing this work before my friends at The Waldorf and the 
public in general, it is with the feeling that I am giving them a book 
illustrative of the best methods of preparing food at the present day. 

The collection of recipes embodies many which have been rendered 
easy of comprehension and arranged in such a manner as to meet the 
wants of all the caterer to large dinners or receptions, as well as the 
more modest entertainment furnished at the hearthside. There has been 
more particular attention devoted to the requirements of the latter than 
to those of the former, as, in the writer's opinion, the giver of a small 
reception has been, it might be said, rather neglected in such works as 
have come before the notice of the undersigned, relative to cookery. 

The title selected for the book is: THE COOK BOOK BY "OSCAR" 
OF THE WALDORF, and it is with great honor dedicated to the patrons 
of The Waldorf, with the hope that they will receive it as a token of 
my high esteem and sincere appreciation of their kindness as shown to 
me at all times. 

In conclusion, let me state that I enter the arena as an author 
with the hope that my experience may prove entertaining to my 
friends, as well as enable them to prepare a Waldorf Dinner at their 
own homes. 

With the hope that my friends and the public will appreciate the 
work here presented to them, I am 

Very respectfully, 

OSCAR TSCHIRKY, 

Maitre d' Hotel, The Waldorf.

A few Suggestions with Regard to the 

Kitchen. 

In the construction of a kitchen range that is, one that is intended for cook- 
ing it is necessary to consider whether it is advisable or not to erect a stove for 
each particular purpose or process, or whether a stove can be so constructed as it 
will enable all processes to be carried on with it at one time, or independently. The 
old-fashioned open stove, with boiler and oven attached, permitted the carrying out 
of more processes at once than any other, such as roasting, baking, boiling, stewing, 
frying, and, at the same time, keeping up a supply of hot water for any purpose for 
which it might be required. But for the perfection of modern cooking something 
further is required in the way of a hot plate, upon which the contents of saucepans 
and other vessels can be kept simmering or boiling fast at the cook's discretion; and 
this demand is not met with in the close-fire range. The evils of the open range 
may be described as very great; the vessels used being exposed to the open fire be- 
come dirty with soot, there is great loss of heat, the kitchen itself receiving more 
than its fair share. Then, again, it is difficult on an open range to modify the heat 
according to certain requirements, and the chimney requires sweeping frequently. 
As rapidly as improvements are made in this country in stoves and ranges, there 
would be some foundation for hoping that sooner or later this would be the most 
expert of cooking countries, for in no other part of the world have such vast strides 
been made, or have such clever inventions been placed before the public as in the United 
States during the past quarter of a century. The excellence of style and perfection 
of use have created for them a demand in all civilized portions of the globe. In 
France, which may be considered the queen of cooking countries, American and 
British stoves are preferred to all others, not only on account of their superior manu- 
facture and metal, but also because they do their work best. 

A very important piece of furniture is the kitchen table. There are many dresser 
boards, shelves and flaps, but they are useless to the cook as compared with a good 
kitchen table. It should be made of stout deal, as large as the size of the kitchen 
will permit, fitted with a convenient drawer for holding knives, forks, spoons, clean 
kitchen cloths, and other necessaries. Not only should the table be the most prominent 
of the furniture in the kitchen, to which all other fittings must play a supplementary 
part, but it should be kept at all times ready for immediate use, uncovered and scru- 
pulously clean. The practice of using the table for a chopping-board, trimming- 



ii SUGGESTIONS. 

board, pot-board, or for making paste, cannot be too carefully avoided. In such 
cases the surface soon becomes scratched and unsightly. 

A well-ventilated kitchen is a pleasure to the cook and conducive to the health of 
all concerned in or about it. Open windows are the best form of ventilators. When 
the windows are opened, they should be pulled down from the top; but as some 
kitchen windows open from pantries or entries or passages, some form of independent 
ventilation should be adopted. 

A very practical writer on kitchen management observes : " I would mention 
the extreme importance of including among the list of household requisites a pair of 
scales and a set of weights. There is no check so effectual against short weights as 
the practice of weighing. With the butcher's meats this is particularly important, 
joints often being unaccountably changed, from one being so like another, except in 
weight. Aside from this, it is almost impossible to cook meat accurately unless it is 
previously weighed and timed. A pair of scales and a set of weights, large enough 
for all domestic purposes, can be bought for three or four dollars, and I have no hesi- 
tation in saying that they will defray their cost in less than a year's use." 

There should be no such thing as waste in a well-ordered kitchen. The term is 
often misapplied to the refuse that results from the preparation of vegetables and 
other things for cooking. But the term " kitchen waste " is also oftentimes more 
correctly applied than intended by the cook who uses it; that is, if the legitimate 
meaning is to be accepted, of anything spoiled, destroyed or thrown away. Waste is 
the outcome of extravagance, hence it is advisable for those in authority carefully to 
calculate the return from the foods supplied for kitchen use. Kitchen cloths are often 
objects of indiscriminate use. Dresser cloths, tea cloths and dusters, pudding-cloths 
and window rags are frequently misappropriated, thus leading to waste. Remnants 
of food and drippings are invariably wasted by an untidy servant. Scraps of meat, 
bones and shanks can be put into the stockpot, which should be found in every 
kitchen. Something may be added to the stockpot daily and this prevents, by using 
up, accumulations that otherwise would be troublesome and offensive. Small quan- 
tities of cold vegetables potatoes, carrots, turnips, cauliflower, spinach, etc. are 
used for thickening and flavoring plain soups, and cold cabbage and potatoes can be 
fried for the kitchen dinner. Dripping, melted down and put into jars, keeps well, 
and is very useful. The fat skimmed off cold broth is good for adding to vegetables 
when mashed, and for other purposes. Strong paper and wooden skewers are handy 
at any time; but it must not be forgotten that heaps of grocers' and other papers are 
often the cause of cockroaches swarming in the kitchen. When there is no use at 
home for so-called "kitchen waste," it should be carefully sorted, and either sold or 
given away. 

As it would be impossible to organize a system of keeping kitchen accounts that 
would be found perfect enough to meet all purposes, something must be left to the 
cook and the master, each of whom will prove his ability to deal with the subject by 



SUGGESTIONS. Hi 

formulating a system to meet his own requirements, based upon a few suggestions we are 
able to make for general guidance. We here have to deal with accounts, and not 
with losses from indiscreet marketing or bad cooking; these matters have to be treated 
on their own merits. 

Every cook should have an order book, with counterfoils, upon which an exact 
copy of the order issued should be taken. With each parcel of goods, care should 
be taken to receive an invoice, and no goods should be received without one. The 
invoice should coincide with the counterfoils of the order book, and be marked with 
the weight and measure and price of each article. After the weights and measures 
have been corroborated by actual weighing and measuring, which is so often neglected, 
and the price is ascertained to be correct, according to the markets, the invoice is 
to be filed for future reference, or, where a kitchen clerk is kept, it may be entered 
up fully in the invoice book kept for the purpose. This is your check upon the trades- 
man, whose petty defalcations are not in all cases a fable. When once it is under- 
stood that the goods are weighed and measured when received, the necessity for 
it will disappear; but the system should not be relaxed, for all that. Instead of an 
order form, books are sometimes used, in which the order is written and signed and 
filled up with prices and quantities by the tradesmen, and returned with the goods. 
This system saves much writing, but it is open to this objection, the book mjght be 
lost, and then the cook would have no existing check upon the account of the trades- 
man. 

The cook should also keep a journal or diary that is to say, a book in which 
can be jotted down at any moment circumstances worthy of note, especially such as 
cash paid out or received for kitchen purposes, orders received and executed, memo- 
randa for a future day, and notes of new ideas. Besides this there should be an ac- 
count or cash book in which tradesmen's bills, wages and cash transactions generally 
are entered; a petty cash book in which small sums under a certain amount can be 
quickly entered without reference to the account book, and a slate hung up in a 
convenient spot. 

Cooks in large kitchens have a style of bookkeeping convenient to themselves, 
as also have proprietors and managers of hotels ; but the small householder is often the 
victim of the fraudulent tradesman, because the cook is not expected to keep accounts, 
and the mistress is too indolent or careless to do so. If the amount of money 
wasted yearly could be calculated, it is certain that the total would be astonishing. 

Every good housekeeper will have a room in which stores can be kept under 
lock and key. Groceries should always, if possible, be bought in quantity, and it 
is well to remember that at certain times of the year, some goods are cheaper than 
at others; all these details should be carefully noted, and a book kept to enter dates 
of purchase, quantities and prices paid. 

A dry room should be chosen for keeping stores, and this should be amply 
fitted with drawers, shelves and nails or hooks. There should be earthenware jars 



iv SUGGESTIONS. 

for sugar, tins for tea, coffee, biscuits and loaf-sugar, and a net for lemons. Jams, 
pickles, and preserves should be kept in the coolest part of the room. Soap should 
be cut up and stood with spaces between the pieces, being turned at regular intervals 
of time. Starch must be kept very dry. Rice, tapioca and sago must be kept in 
covered vessels or insects will get into them. Flour is usually kept in the pantry in 
a flour box Onions, shallots, leaks, etc., should not be kept in a storeroom for ob- 
vious reasons. Dried herbs in separate bags may be conveniently suspended from 
the ceiling or walls. Apples must be stored in a near-by room, etc. 



Menus, or Bills of Fare. 

Menus are prepared for breakfasts, luncheons, dinners and suppers, but the 
dinner menu is of the greatest importance. The menus or bills of fare are generally 
selected a few days in advance, in order that the necessary provisions may be pur- 
chased, and that there may be ample time to prepare everything necessary, thereby 
avoiding much confusion. 

The menu should be strictly followed in every case. If the dinner is to include 
ladies, it should be of light, fancy dishes; but, on the contrary, if intended for gentle- 
men alone, it should be more substantial and at the same time shorter. 

The color of the various meats and sauces should be as different from each other 
as possible, from one course to another, offering all the foods in their respective sea- 
sons, and have the early products of the finest quality (See Table of Supplies, Page 
xv), and only use preserved articles when it is impossible to obtain others 

Oysters, as a rule, are always served at the beginning of a dinner, though they are 
used only in such months of the year in which the letter "r" occurs, such as January, 
February, March, April, September, October, November and December, and little 
neck clams are used in their stead. 

After the oysters, come the soups. If two soups are to be served, select one 
clear and one thick; but if one is to be used, give the preference to the clear 
soup. 

Hot hors d'ceuvre generally consist of timbales, croustades, palmettes, mousse- 
lines, bouchees, etc. Cold side dishes are served with the same course, such as olives, 
radishes, canapes, caviar, anchovies, etc. 

The fish, if it is boiled or fried, should have potatoes served with it; if broiled or 
cooked in any fancy manner, serve cucumber salad with it. 

If two entrees are chosen in a dinner, the first entree should be made the light- 
est of the two, and they should be made in a fancy way, so as to avoid any carving. 
Terrapin, oysters, crabs, lobsters, shrimps and frogs are allowable as entrees, especially 
during Lent. 

The roasts or solid joints are composed of saddles of either veal, mutton, lamb, 
venison or antelope, or beef tenderloins. Also, turkey, goose, duck, capon, etc,, may 
be served, accompanied by one or two vegetables. 

After the roasts and vegetables, and before the game, a punch or sherbet is 
always served, but should not be given an extra heading on the menu, simply placing 
them on a line by themselves. 

Games are served immediately following the sherbet ; a roast usually being pre- 



vi MENUS. 

ferred for dinner, but poultry may be served instead, such as turkey, capon, duck, 
squabs, etc. 

Cold dishes are served after the game, with a salad. If no cold dishes are served 
with the dinner, the salad should be served with the game. 

Hot and cold sweet dishes are served after the game, and consist of puddings, 
crusts, fritters, pancakes, omelets and soufflees, the cold and hot sweet dishes forming 
a separate course by themselves. The cold dishes are composed usually of jellies, 
bavarois, creams, blancmanges, macedoines, charlottes, etc. 

After the sweet dishes, comes the dessert, consisting of cheese, fresh fruits, pre- 
served fruits, jams, dried fruits, candied fruits, bonbons, mottoes, frozen puddings, 
plombieres, ices, ice-cream and fancy cakes. 

Coffee. Turkish or French coffee is usually served, and is the last article upon 
the menu.

Seasons. 



Almost every kind of food has its particular season that is, a period of the 
year when it is in its prime. Produced out of season they may bring higher prices, 
but, however grateful they may be to the gourmet, there are few foods that do not 
lose flavor by being forced. A large variety of foods are in season the year round, 
but this does not apply to the majority. The following list may be found of some 
use to the cook, although the best guide as to what is in season is to visit the 
markets, remembering always that when foods are cheapest and most plentiful they 
are most frequently prime; when expensive they are generally out of season. It may 
be taken for granted then, that when dear they are scarce, or when cheap they are 
plentiful, but their high price does not necessarily improve their quality.

Soups. 



Kettner writes about Soup: "There has been a good deal of needless contro- 
versy about Soup, some people finding in it a dinner in itself, and some refusing it 
as a weak wash, fit only for babies and invalids. Grimod de la Reyniere said that 
Soup is to a dinner what a portico is to a palace, or an overture is to an opera. It is 
not only the commencement of the feast, but should give an idea of what is to 
follow." Another epicure, no less than Marquis de Cussy, dubs Soup a sort of 
preface to the dinner, and expresses his opinion that a good work can do without a 
preface. Undoubtedly the majority of opinions would be against the Marquis, for 
with the Soup not only does the feast begin, but the stomach receives a little encour- 
aging stimulation which prepares it for the more elaborate task about to follow. 
Admitting this, however, Kettner, continues, " It is quite true, however, that to serve 
a purpose (stomach stimulating), we do not require much weight of matter, and the 
plain rule to follow is: for a great dinner the Soups should be as light as possible, 
just enough to give a fillip; for a little dinner, with only one or two dishes, they may 
be as rich and satisfying as you please. De Cussy is quite in accord here with 
Thomas Walker, who maintained that if he gave turtle Soup to his guests they would 
want but little else 'whitebait and a grouse.' ' 

Soup should always be sent to the table in a metal or earthenware tureen, tightly 
covered. A metal ladle is best for serving and it should be separate from the tureen. 
Tureens with holes cut in the lids for the ladle handle, let out the heat and steam. 
The following directions may be of value to the soup maker: 

Bring the cold water in the stockpot with the meat and bones to the boil slowly, 
and let it simmer for hours, never boiling, and never ceasing to simmer. Skim off 
every bit of scum and fat, for which purpose it is as well to .use a stockpot with a 
faucet at the bottom. Beware of using too much salt ; a little is advisable, as it 
causes the scum to rise, but as the liquid boils down, the proportion of salt is 
increased in consequence, because the water flies off in steam, but the salt remains. 
Soft water is the best for making Soup. 

Beef Tea. 

Procure some lean rump of beef, remove every particle of fat, cut into small 
pieces and place in a champagne bottle, cork and tie down tightly. Place the bottle 
in a deep saucepan of cold water, reaching two-thirds of the way to the top of the 
bottle, place the pan on a slow fire, and allow it to come slowly to a boil. After 
boiling for fifteen minutes, take out the bottle, pour out the liquor, and use as 
required. 



io SOUPS. 



Beef Jelly. 



Prepare some beef tea with very little if any salt, and without adding water. 
Place an eighth of an ounce of gelatine in a saucepan with a little cold water and 
soak it; let it stay there until sufficiently swollen, then place on the fire and boil 
until dissolved. Take the beef-tea extract when nearly cold, add the gelatine, stir 
well and allow it to become well set. 

Bisque of Clams. 

Place a good knuckle of veal, weighing about a pound and a half, into a soup 
kettle, with a quart of water, one small onion, a sprig of parsley, a bay leaf, and the 
liquor drained from the clams, and simmer gradually for an hour and a half, skim- 
ming from time to time. Then strain the soup and again place it in the kettle; rub 
a couple of tablespoonfuls of butter with an equal amount of flour together and add 
it to the soup when it is boiling, stirring the while until again boiling. Chop up 
twenty-five clams very fine and place them in the soup, season, and boil for about 
five minutes, then add a pint of milk or cream, and remove from the fire immediately, 
and serve. 

Bisque of Crabs. 

Place a dozen live crabs in some cold water with a little salt, and let them soak 
there for one hour, then hash up a couple of ounces of carrot with an equal quantity 
of onion, and fry them together with a little butter in a saucepan large enough to 
hold the crabs, add a little parsley in sprigs, thyme and bay leaf, seasoning with salt, 
a quarter of a bottle of white wine and a little white stock, then cover with the lid 
and cook for fifteen minutes, after which remove the crabs, strain the broth, and place 
it one side for twenty minutes, when the top should be poured off. Next, remove 
the shells from the crabs, taking out the lungs from both sides, and wash each one 
at a time in some slightly warmed water, removing the small legs, then drain them 
and pound to a paste, with about half their quantity of cooked rice, add a little of the 
juice in which they have been cooked, drain first through a sieve and then through a 
tammy-cloth, and mix in half a pint of bechamel sauce. Add a little salt and red 
pepper, and place over the fire just previous to serving, but do not allow it to come 
to a boil, adding an eighth of a pound of fine butter, and mix with a spoon until 
entirely melted, and serve with bread crusts fried in butter. 



Bisque of Crayfish. 



Procure five or six dozen fresh water crayfish, and boil them without any vinegar 
in the water. Select two dozen and a half of the finest tails that remain whole, and 
pound the rest with all the fleshy parts and meat in a mortar, with the flesh from the 
breasts of two roasted chickens or fowls. Boil the crumb of a couple of French rolls 



SOUPS. ii 

in some rich broth ; place this in a mortar with a few yolks of hard boiled eggs, and 
pound well together, then mix thoroughly with the crayfish and chicken ; put the 
shells of the fish to boil in a little water or broth, and rub through a fine sieve. Boil 
a pint and a half of cream, stirring continually so that no scum will arise ; pour this 
into the soup, seasoning with salt and pepper. Have in readiness two spawn of a 
lobster well pounded, dilute it with some of the ,broth, and mix in with the soup, 
which must be kept hot but without boiling. Soak a few rounds of bread and lay 
them at the bottom of a tureen, pour the bisque over them, place the tails which 
have been placed one side, over the soup, and serve very hot. 

Bisque of Lobster. 

Remove the meat of a lobster from the shell, and cut the tender pieces into 
quarter inch dice ; put the ends of the claw-meat and any tough portions in a sauce- 
pan with the bones of the body and a little cold water, and boil for twenty minutes, 
adding a little water from time to time as may be necessary. Put the coral to dry in 
a moderate oven, and mix a little flour with some cold milk, and stir into the milk, 
which should be boiling, stirring over the fire for ten minutes ; then strain the water 
from the bones and other parts, mix it with the milk, add a little butter, salt, pepper 
and cayenne to taste, and rub the dry coral through a fine hair sieve, putting enough 
into the soup to make it a bright pink color. Place the green fat and lobster dice in 
a soup tureen, strain the boiling soup over them and serve at once. 

Bisque of Oysters. 

Place about thirty medium sized oysters in a saucepan together with their own 
juice, and poach them over a hot fire, after which drain them well. Then fry a 
shallot colorless in some butter together with an onion, sprinkle over them a little 
curry and add some of the oyster juice, seasoning with salt and red pepper ; pound 
the oysters to a good firm paste, moistening them with a little of their juice, and 
strain through a fine tammy-cloth ; warm them over the fire, but do not let them boil; 
add a small quantity of thickening of potato flour mixed with a little water, (about a 
tablespoonful for each quart of the mixture), and when about to serve, incorporate 
some cream and fine butter, garnishing with some chopped oysters and mushrooms, 
mixed with bread crumbs and herbs ; add a little seasoning of salt, pepper and nut- 
meg, some raw egg yolks and roll this mixture into ball-shaped pieces, place them on 
a well buttered baking sheet in a slack oven and poach them, then serve. 

Tomato Bisque. 

Stew half a can of tomatoes until they become quite soft and will strain readily, 
then boil a quart of milk in a double boiler. Cook together a tablespoonful of corn- 
starch and an equal quantity of butter in a small saucepan, adding enough hot milk 



12 SOUPS. 

to make it pour readily, then stir it carefully into the boiling milk, and let it boil for 
about ten minutes ; then add a third of a cup of butter in small lumps, and stir it 
until it has become well incorporated, add some salt and pepper and the strained 
tomatoes, and if the tomatoes are very acid, half a saltspoonful of soda may be 
added. Serve while hot. 

Broth. 



Barley 



Put a trimmed sheep's head or two pounds of fleshy shin of beef into half a 
gallon of water, adding a teacupful of well- washed and strained barley (Pearl), two 
sliced onions and a few sprigs of parsley, together with half a dozen peeled and 
sliced potatoes and a little thyme ; season with pepper and salt, and simmer for 
three or four hours, stirring frequently to prevent the meat and vegetables settling at 
the bottom and burning. Serve very hot. 

Beef Broth with Vermicelli. 

Cut some lean beef into small squares and chop it, put in a stew pan, with an 
egg broken and poured over ; skim the fat off of two quarts of cold bouillon, and 
pour it over the whole, add a piece of leek, a piece of celery, and a little minced 
carrot, stirring occasionally. When it bubbles, move it to one side, and simmer 
gently for fifteen or twenty minutes. Drain into a good-sized bowl through a wet 
cloth, and skim off all the fat, and put it on to boil for five minutes longer, then add 
a few ounces of blanched vermicelli. Serve with toast, in a tureen. 

Chicken Broth. 

Chop a chicken into pieces and put them into an earthenware pot with two table- 
spoonfuls of pearl barley, one tea spoonful of coriander seed, pour in two quarts of 
water and boil for three hours, skimming frequently ; then add a handful or so of 
lettuce leaves, cover over the pot, remove it from the fire, let it stand for twenty 
minutes, strain through a cloth or fine sieve, and serve. 

Clam-Juice Broth. 

After washing the clams in their shells in cold water, place them on a stove in a 
very thick saucepan, and as they become hot, their shells will open ; then carefully 
pour out the broth, strain it through a closely woven cloth, season to suit the taste, 
and serve. 

Jelly Broth, Palestine Style. 

Make one quart of jelly broth, strain, and keep it hot by the side of the fire. 
With a vegetable scoop, cut some balls from Jerusalem artichokes, blanch them and 
put them in a saucepan with a little broth, and boil until they are tender, and the 
broth is reduced to a glaze. Boil one teacupful of well-washed rice in broth till soft. 



SOUPS. 13 

place the artichokes and rice into a soup tureen, mix one-half teaspoonful of sugar 
with the broth, pour it over the vegetables, and serve with croutons of fried bread, 
or sippets of toast. 

Jelly Broth with Macaroni. 

Boil in salted water six or eight ounces of macaroni ; when tender, drain, and cut 
it across into pieces about one and one-half inch in length. Have ready some boil- 
ing jelly broth and put it in the macaroni. In about ten minutes time turn the broth 
into a soup tureen, and serve with a plateful of grated Parmesan cheese. 

Mutton Broth. 

Wash two pounds of the scrag end of a neck of mutton, wipe it with a cloth, 
cut off the fat and skin, scrape the meat from the bones and chop it into 
small squares. Put the meat in a saucepan with three pints of water and 
the bones in another pan with one pint of water. Place the pan containing the 
bones by the side of the fire and let it simmer until wanted. Set the pan with the 
meat over a quick fire, boil it, skimming frequently, and when the scum comes up 
quite white put in one pint of pearl barley and skim again. Cut a carrot, a turnip 
and an equal quantity of celery into small pieces and fry them in one tablespoonful 
of butter for five minutes, add them to the meat and cook slowly for about four hours. 
Put one tablespoonful each of flour and butter into a saucepan over the fire, and when 
the flour is smooth add the strained broth from the bones, and pour it into the meat 
broth. Add one tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley, two of salt, and one salt- 
spoonful of pepper. Simmer gently for ten minutes longer and serve without strain- 
ing. In most cases the meat is preferred strained from the broth, but if the skin and 
fat are removed the strong and disagreeable flavor will be prevented. A larger 
quantity of vegetables may be used if desired, or rice may be used instead of barley, 
or the meat may be cut into dice and fried a few minutes in butter. If the carrots 
are grated they will give the broth a fine color. 

Plain Broth. 

Place the desired amount of beef into a stockpot, with a knuckle of veal and half 
a fowl, covering with plenty of water. Boil this slowly, letting the scum come to the 
surface and removing same until it has become quite clear; then while still boiling 
put in a head of celery, three or four small carrots, three leeks, three turnips and a 
couple of onions, stick into one of the onions a few cloves, say four or five; move the 
stockpot to one side and simmer for several hours; skim off all the fat, put in a lump 
of salt and it is ready for serving. 

Tapioca Broth. 

Place a chicken and a knuckle of veal in a saucepan or double boiler, with a few 
vegetables previously cooked in white broth, and pour over one gallon of cold water, 



I 4 SOUPS. 

set the saucepan on the fire and boil gently until the meat is done. Strain the broth 
through a cloth into another saucepan, remove the fat, and boil up once more; then 
add as much tapioca as may be required, letting it fall into the soup like rain. 
Remove the saucepan to the side of the fire, and cook gently for twenty minutes or 
so. If desired it can be thickened with yolks of eggs. Turn the soup into the 
tureen, and serve it very hot. 

Broth Thickened with Eggs. 

Take enough good game or fowl consomme, and to each half pint add the yolk 
of one egg, and beat in and thicken it with a little flour. 

Veal Broth. 

Place four or five pounds of knuckle of veal in a saucepan with three quarts of 
water, two blades of mace, one onion, a little parsley, and a head of celery cut into 
pieces, seasoning with salt and pepper. When boiling, move the saucepan a trifle to 
the side, and keep the water simmering until it is reduced one-third. Strain the 
broth, stir in with it a little well boiled rice or vermicelli, and serve. 

Vegetable Broth. 

Boil two sliced potatoes, a carrot, turnip and onion for an hour in a quart of 
water, taking care to keep the full amount of water in, by adding a little now and 
then, as required ; flavor with salt and sweet herbs and strain. Add a little mush- 
room catsup and serve. 

Catfish Chowder. 

Wash the fish in warm water, then place it on the fire in just enough water to 
cover it, and boil until tender, or until the bones will slip out. Take out the largest 
bones, chop up the fish, put it into a stewpan with about a pint of water, a large piece 
of butter, one breakfast cupful of cream, a small quantity of pepper and salt, one 
small onion, one teaspoonful of mustard, and one-half teacupful of walnut catsup, 
and stew the mixture until quite thick. Garnish with sliced lemons, and serve hot. 

Clam Chowder. 

Fry six slices of crisp, fat pork, after which chop them to pieces, and sprinkle 
them in the bottom of a pot ; lay over a layer of clams, adding a little cayenne 
or black pepper and salt, and sprinkle on a few small lumps of butter, then place a 
layer of chopped onions, and another of small crackers, split and moistened with 
some warm milk. Over this preparation pour a little of the fat left in the pan in 
which the pork has been fried ; then repeat the layers of pork, clams, and onions, 
until the pot is filled, or nearly so, then cover with water and stew slowly, keeping 



SOUPS. 15 

the pot closely covered the while, for three-quarters of an hour, then drain off all the 
liquor that will come off readily, turn the chowder into a tureen, and return the 
gravy to the pot. Thicken the gravy with some flour or pounded crackers, add a 
glass of wine, some catsup and a little spiced sauce, let it boil up and pour it over the 
contents in the tureen. Either walnut or butternut pickles may be served with it. 

Corn Chowder. 

Scrape about one quart of raw sweet Indian corn from the cob, and place it in a 
saucepan with enough water to cover, boiling it for twenty minutes. Skim out the 
corn as it floats on the top ; pare some potatoes, so that when cut into slices they will 
fill a pint measure, soak and put them into hot water to scald. Fry an onion to- 
gether with a piece of salt pork of about two inches cube, and strain the fat into a 
saucepan with the corn water. Put in the potatoes, corn, one teaspoonful of salt, one 
of pepper, place the pan on the fire and let the liquor simmer for a quarter of an 
hour or until the corn and potatoes are tender. Put in one tablespoonful of butter 
one pint of potatoes, one pint of milk, and boil up again. It must be served hot with 
crisp crackers. 

Consomme Stock. 

Cut finely a shin of beef, put it in a stockpot with two scraped carrots, two 
peeled onions, three washed leeks, a few sticks of celery, and a small bunch of par- 
sley roots, all finely minced ; add six cloves, one teaspoonful of peppercorns, a bay 
leaf, and the whites and shells of six eggs. Moisten this with two gallons of broth 
and one quart of water, stir for a few minutes, place on the range, add a few pieces of 
chicken or bones if handy. Simmer for four hours, skim off the grease and strain 
through a wet cloth. 

Chicken Consomme. 

Remove the fillets from two chickens and put the carcases with six pounds of 
fillet of veal into a stockpot with five quarts of good stock, season with half an 
ounce of salt, place the pot on the fire and boil ; skim it well, add two onions stuck 
with two cloves each, a head of celery and four leeks. Let the pot simmer on the 
side of the fire for about three hours, skim off the fat, strain the broth and clarify 
with the fillets of chicken previously removed ; then strain once more through a cloth 
into a basin. This consomme should be colorless. 

Duchess Consomme. 

Butter a baking sheet, cover with four ounces of chou-paste, cook in the oven 
for six minutes, then cover the paste with forcemeat in small lumps laid at a little 
distance apart. Cut the paste into twelve equal sized pieces, each piece holding a 
lump of the forcemeat, pour one quart of boiling consomme over and serve. 



16 SOUPS. 

Fish Consomme. 

Put into a two gallon stewpan three quarters of a pound of butter, four sliced

and put it, with the bone, in a very large saucepan filled with sufficient water to cover 
the meat, then place on fire and boil. As the scum rises skim- off with a skimmer.

to taste with grated nutmeg, pepper and salt. Rub the whole through a fine hair 
sieve, adding a little cream, and with the aid of two teaspoons form the mass into 
quenelles. Place them side by side in a saucepan, pour in carefully sufficient boiling 
stock to cover them, and cook gently for a few minutes. Pour the necessary quantity 
of well flavored stock or broth into a tureen, add the quenelles and serve hot. The 
stock in which they were cooked may also be poured in if desired. 

Rice-and-Pea Soup. 

Wash thoroughly one teacupful of rice, put it into a saucepan with one pint of 
white stock, and allow it to boil gently until it is very tender. Put one-half pint of 
young green peas into another saucepan with one pint of white stock and stew them 
until tender. When both the above vegetables are cooked, stir them together and 
add as much more stock as will make the required quantity of soup; when boiling 
move the pan to the side of the fire, and stir in quickly the yolk of an egg that has 
been beaten up with one pint of cream. Season to the taste with salt and pepper, 
pour the soup into a soup tureen, and serve it with a plateful of sippets of toast or 
croutons of bread fried in butter to a delicate brown. 

Rice-and-Tomato Soup.

ounce of butter. Pour the soup into a tureen, and serve it with sippets of toast or 
croutons of bread that have been fried in butter. 

Russian Julienne Soup. 

Cut into strips one celery root, one carrot, one turnip, one leek, two onions and 
a small cabbage, and have ready; also cut up a quantity of mushrooms equal in bulk 
to all the other vegetables. Put the leek and onions into a saucepan with a small 
lump of butter, and fry them; do not, however, let them take a color. Then put in 
the other vegetables, together with the mushrooms, and cook gently until the moisture 
of the latter is reduced; pour over sufficient rich broth to moisten, reduce this to a 
glaze, pour over three or four quarts of boiling broth, remove the saucepan to the 
side of the fire, and allow the contents to simmer gently for an hour and a half. Mix 
well, stir in a little finely chopped fennel, and strain in enough sour cream to thicken; 
turn the soup into a tureen, and serve with rissoles, croquettes or meat patties. This 
latter is strictly the Russian way of serving this soup.

and two pounds of knuckle of veal, and put them into a saucepan or stockpot. Put 
four ounces of dried turtle into a bowl of cold water, and allow it to soak for forty- 
eight hours, changing the water three or four times; then put it into a saucepan of 
water and simmer very gently for about twenty-four hours. Place the turtle in the 
saucepan with the other meat, pour in the liquor in which it simmered; this should be 
sufficient to make the soup; bring it gently to the boil, skim as required, add two or 
three onions, one carrot, half a head of celery, one turnip, all cut up into pieces, a 
sprig each of thyme and marjoram, one teacupful each of basil and peppercorns, a

the pan to the side of the fire and allow it to stand there for thirty minutes, by which 
time it should be quite clear. Skim well, strain the liquor through a napkin or very 
fine sieve into another saucepan, add the turtle, which should have been pressed and 
cut into convenient-sized pieces, squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, salt to taste, 
boil up once more, turn the whole into a soup tureen and serve. A little caramel 
may be added should the soup not be dark enough. A wineglassful of Madeira is 
considered a great improvement. 

Mock Turtle, French Style. . 

Select a fine fresh calf's head with the skin on, wash it well in warm water, and 
when well cleared of blood boil it for two hours; then take it up and allow it to get 
cold. Then cut off in one inch square pieces the fat parts of the head which adhere 
to the skin, and wash them well in several waters. Pour two quarts of good beef 
stock slightly seasoned with salt, cayenne and truffles and mushrooms, into the soup 
pot, add five of six onions, five carrots and five turnips, all cut into slices, a head of 
celery cut small, two or three shallots, a bunch of sweet herbs, a bunch of parsley, 
three bay leaves, half a dozen cloves, half a dozen allspice, three blades of mace, two 
slices of lean ham chopped small, three or four tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, 
and one tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce; let the whole simmer for two hours 
and then strain through a fine sieve. Put in it the pieces of calf's head, boil it up, 
and pour it into the tureen together with a little strained lemon juice, two tablespoon- 
fuls of white wine, and one tablespoonful of brandy. Serve cayenne and thin slices 
of lemon with it. 

Preserved Green Turtle Soup. 

Choose a medium-sized turtle, cut off the head and allow it to bleed for twelve 
or fourteen hours. Remove the bones by opening the sides, cut the carcass into 
pieces, and blanch them for three minutes in boiling water. Lift off the top shell and 
place it in a saucepan, covering it with white broth, a handful of whole peppers, a 
dozen or so of cloves, half a bunch of thyme, and six bay leaves (all the above spices 
and herbs being tied up in a piece of cloth). Add a handful of salt, and cook for 
about an hour. Drain, remove the bones, and cut the flesh in dice. Allow the broth 
to be reduced to three-fourths its quantity, then put in the white lean meat, allowing 
it to cook for ten minutes, and then add the green part of the turtle. Fill some 
medium-sized vessels with this, and when cold pour hot lard over the tops. A wine- 
glassful or so of Madeira wine may be added to the broth if desired. '"\ y 



Turtle Soup Stock. 



Prepare and cut up a turtle. Put the pieces of shell in a saucepan over the fire 
with sufficient boiling water to cover them, and boil for two or three hours, or until 
the outer edges of the shell are soft. As the water boils away add more, always

keeping the shells entirely covered. Cut the soft parts of the shells into pieces about 
one-half inch square, place them in an earthenware bowl, cover over with a wet 
napkin, and keep in a cool place until wanted. Place the hard parts, of the shells 
again into water in which it was boiled, put in also one-eighth of the first weight of 
the turtle of beef bones, and one-sixteenth of the weight of veal bones, or of calf's 
feet and head as directed for soup, skinning the calf's head. On the top of these in- 
gredients lay the neck and fins of the turtle, and the cushions or rounded muscles at 
top of the turtle fins, unless part of the latter is to be reserved raw for broiling as 
steaks ; add enough water to cover all, together with two tablespoonfuls of salt, and 
allow all to boil gently for two hours or more, or until the bones of the fins separate 
easily from the flesh. Remove any scum which may rise, and keep the soup kettle 
closely covered. When the fins and cushions are tender, take them out of the stock, 
separate the flesh from the bones, keeping it in good sized pieces, and put it aside, in 
a cool place until wanted, in an earthenware vessel covered with a wet cloth. Return 
the bones to the stock, add to it the proportions usually employed for soup stock, of 
carrots, turnips, onions, parsley, sweet herbs, whole cloves, mace and peppercorns, 
and boil gently for five or six hours, keeping the pan closely covered. After the 
liver, legs, fat and intestines have been soaked in cold water boil them in the stock, 
the intestines being turned outward like the reversed finger of a glove, and well 
washed and scraped. When the stock is boiled it should be strained through a 
folded towel, laid in a colander placed over a large earthenware bowl, until clear. 
All those parts of the turtle which have been cooked and covered with wet cloths 
or napkins should now be placed in the bowls and covered with the strained turtle 
stock ; all the stock remaining should be saved for soup. Most turtle cooks advise 
leaving out the intestines, chiefly because they are more trouble to prepare than they 
are worth. 



Vegetable Soup. 



Chop finely sufficient onion, carrot and celery in equal proportions to fill five 
breakfast cups, also one teacupful each of turnip, cabbage and parsnip. The cabbage, 
parsnip and onion should have been partially boiled for five minutes and then well 
drained. Put all the vegetables into a saucepan, pour in one quart of stock and one 
quart of boiling water and boil gently until tender ; then put in with them one break- 
"ast cupful of tomatoes, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one teaspoonful each 
of salt and sugar and one-half teaspoonful of pepper. Turn the soup into a tureen 
and serve. 



Vermicelli Soup. 



Put from three to four pounds of knuckle of veal, one and one-half pounds of 
scrag of mutton and one-half pound of ham, all cut up into small pieces, into 
a saucepan with one-fourth pound of butter, and an onion stuck with one or two 
cloves, and fry them over the fire for ten minutes. Put in with the meat a bunch of 



SOUPS. 45 

sweet herbs, one anchovy, two carrots, three or four blades of mace and four heads 
of celery. Place the lid on the saucepan and stand it over the fire until all the gravy 
has been extracted from the meat. Drain the gravy into a basin, pour four quarts of 
water over the meat and boil slowly until reduced to three pints. Strain the soup into 
another saucepan, add one-fourth pound of vermicelli, a head of celery cut into small 
pieces and a small quantity of cayenne pepper and salt. Put a French roll into a soup 
tureen, pour a small quantity of the soup on it, let it soak for a few minutes, then 
pour in the remainder of the soup and serve. 

Vermicelli, -Queen Style. 

Blanch the vermicelli in boiling water, them drain it ; put it into a saucepan 
with rich broth, season to taste and let it boil gently until cooked. Beat well the 
yolks of eight eggs and mix a small quantity of cream with them ; pour them into the 
soup and stir them by the side of the fire for a few minutes, but do not allow them to 
boil. Turn the vermicelli into a tureen and serve it with a plate of sippets of toast. 

Vermicelli Soup with Tomato Puree. 

Prepare three quarts of fish stock, as for thick soup ; when boiling move it to 
the side of the fire and let it simmer for half an hour. Make one and one-half pints 
of fresh tomato puree. Skim the fat off the soup, put in a bunch of parsley and 
sweet herbs and the tomato puree, then allow it to simmer for twenty minutes 
longer. Boil gently in salted water one-half pound of vermicelli. Strain the soup, 
put in the vermicelli, skim off all the fat and boil up again. Turn the soup into a 
tureen, and serve. 

White Soup. 

Put six pounds of lean gravy beef into a saucepan with one-half gallon of water 
and stew it gently until all the goodness is extracted, then take the beef out. Put 
into the saucepan with the liquor six pounds of knuckle of veal, one-fourth pound of 
ham, four onions and four heads of celery, all cut into pieces, a few peppercorns 
and a bunch of sweet herbs. Stew all these gently for seven or eight hours, skim- 
ming off all the fat as it rises to the top. Mix with the crumb of two French rolls 
two ounces of blanched and pounded sweet almonds, put them into a saucepan with 
one pint of cream and a little stock, boil for ten minutes, then pass them through a 
silk sieve, using a wooden spoon in the process. Mix the cream and almonds with 
the soup, then turn it into a tureen and serve. 

Windsor Soup. 

Boil three calf's feet for one hour in two quarts of broth and one quart of 
water ; when done and cold, cut them into pieces, moisten with three or four pints of 
their own broth, adding a garnished bunch of parsley, one-half wineglassful of 



46 SOUPS.

and beat them thoroughly, pour in one and one-half breakfast cupfuls of water, add 
six ounces of loaf sugar, the grated yellow rind and strained juice of a large lemon, 
and one and one-half pints of white wine. Whisk the soup over a gentle fire till 
frothed and on the point of boiling, then move it off immediately, turn it into a soup 
tureen and serve with a plate of small sponge cakes or fancy biscuits. The soup may 
be served as soon as ready, as the froth will soon go down. 

Soup with Noques. 

Put four ounces of butter into a stewpan to melt, add four or five ounces of flour 
and stir it over the fire until nicely browned. Pour in gradually with the flour three 
quarts of rich broth, continue stirring over the fire until the broth boils, then move 
the stewpan slightly to the side of the fire. Warm one-half pound of butter in a basin 
and work it with a spoon until creamy, then mix with it, one at a time, the yolks of 
five eggs and the whites of two. Beat the butter and eggs until light and frothy, 
then sift in slowly six ounces of flour, work the whole to a smooth paste, season it 
with nutmeg and salt and add the whipped whites of two more eggs. Try the consis- 
tency of the above mixture by poaching a small quantity of it in boiling water, stir in a 
little flour, if too light, and if too thick then stir in a little butter. Divide the mixture 
into small equal portions and shape them into round balls. Drop the noques into a 
saucepan of boiling salted water, give them one boil up, then move the pan to the side 
of the fire and boil again until firm. Beat the yolks of four eggs with a little cream, 
skim the, fat off the soup, put in the beaten eggs and stir them by the fire till thick. 
The soup should not boil after the eggs are added. Drain the noques, put them into a 
soup tureen, strain the soup over them through a fine hair sieve and serve at once. 



Soup Without Meat.

butter and toss over the fire for a few minutes. Put in with the onions some celery 
cut into small pieces, a bunch of chopped parsley and some finely-shredded cabbage 
lettuces; stir these ingredients over the fire for fifteen minutes, then put in one break- 
fast cupful of crushed dry biscuits and two quarts of boiling milk and water mixed in 
equal quantities. Season the soup to taste with salt and pepper and let it simmer by 
the side of the fire for an hour. Beat two eggs well and stir them in the soup when 
taken from the fire. Serve with a plateful of sippets of toast. 



Fish. 



Anchovies. 

These delicious little seafish come principally from the Mediterranean ; those 
esteemed most highly come from Gorgona. These fish are also found in small shoals 
along the coast of Great Britain, but there are no specific fisheries for them. They 
are caught at night by nets, the fish being attracted by lights attached to the boats. 

To preserve them for exportation, the heads are cut off and the bodies cleaned. 
They are then placed in brine, packed in barrels and afterwards put up in bottles for 
the market. Dutch anchovies may be known by their having the scales removed ; 
and the French anchovies by their larger size ; and both by the pale tint of their 
flesh. This peculiar coloring is sometimes counterfeited by artificial means in sprats 
or sardines. It would be well to note that the color of the pickle of the best fish 
on being filtered, is of a clear pink, without sediment ; whereas the inferior sorts are 
generally turbid and red only when stirred, with also a heavy red sediment. 

To Serve Anchovies. 

They must be thoroughly cleaned, boned and trimmed. To open, they should 
be soaked in cold water for a couple of hours, taken out and dried on a cloth, and the 
backs divided by the points of the two thumbs, rather than with a knife, which should 
never touch them unless it is electro-plated or of silver. Lay the halves neatly on a 
dish, and garnish with finely chopped white of egg and parsley ; pour salad oil over all. 

Stuffed Anchovies. 

Split open some anchovies, wash them well in white wine and bone them. Mince 
a little cooked fish of any kind, place in a basin with very fine breadcrumbs, and 
make it into a paste by adding yolk of eggs. Stuff the anchovies with this mixture, 
dip into frying batter, plunge into a fryingpan of boiling fat and fry to a light color. 
Take out when done, drain and arrange on the dish, and serve with a garnish of fried 
parsley. 

Anchovies with Olives. 

Thoroughly wash and cut off the fillets of some anchovies, and chop them up 
very fine with a little parsley and onion ; put the whole into a mortar and pound it 
well, adding a little cayenne for seasoning. Cut a number of Spanish olives in halves, 
take out the stones, and fill them with the pounded anchovy mixture. In the mean-

time cut some small rounds of bread about an inch in thickness and an inch and a 
half in diameter, scrape out a little from the center of each, put them into a frying- 
pan with butter, and fry to a nice light golden color ; then take out and drain, and 
arrange on a napkin spread over a dish ; put an olive in each, serve with a little 
mayonnaise sauce poured over and around the foot of the croutons of fried bread. 

Baked Bass, Plain. 

Scale, wash and thoroughly clean a bass, leaving the head intact, if to be sent 
to table whole ; then make a stuffing of two cupfuls of breadcrumbs, one teacupful 
of butter, the rind of a quarter of a lemon minced fine, and two or three sprigs of 
parsley, green thyme and marjoram. Season this mixture with pepper and salt. 
Beat up a couple of eggs, a very little water, and mix the stuffing with it. Fill into 
the fish and sew up when stuffed. Score both sides with a sharp knife by cutting 
down to the bone, and put a slice of salt pork, cut thin, into each incision ; then bake 
in a pan and baste with stock and seasoning. Place a little tomato puree or tomato 
sauce into the pan with the gravy, after removing the fish, and allow it to come to 
a boil ; then skim and strain and serve in a tureen with the fish. Care should be 
taken not to break the fish when transferring it from the pan to the dish. Some con- 
sider a glass of white wine added to each half pint of sauce an improvement. 

Boiled Bass. 

Dress a bass, wash well and drain it, and place in a saucepan of warm water, 
salted, and set over the fire. When the water boils remove to one side, and simmer 
gently for twenty minutes, by which time the fish should be quite done. Let it re- 
main in the liquor until wanted, then take out, drain and place on a napkin spread 
over a dish, garnish with boiled potatoes and sprigs of parsley and serve. 

Broiled Bass. 

Clean a bass, split it lengthwise in halves, cutting each half again into two or 
three pieces ; sprinkle over with flour and place on a gridiron over a slow fire, broil- 
ing them very gently, brush over continually with butter to prevent burning. When 
of a light brown color, place the pieces of fish on a napkin spread over a dish and 
serve. 

Fried Bass with Bacon. 

Wash, scale and carefully clean the bass, season well with pepper and salt, roll 
them in flour and let them lie in it until ready to be co.oked, then drop into a pan of 
very hot lard and fry until nicely browned. Then fry in a separate pan four slices of 
streaky bacon ; one piece for each piece of the fish and lay the slices of bacon one 
on each piece of fish. Garnish with parsley and serve with mashed potatoes. 



FISH. 49 

Fried Black Bass. 

Scale and clean the requisite number of black bass, roll well in flour, put in a fry- 
ingpan with hot fat to about half their height and fry until done. Place on a dish, 
garnish with potatoes, slices of lemon, parsley, and serve. 

Broiled Bloaters. 

Scrape and clean enough bloaters and wipe dry on a towel ; split down the belly 
from head to tail and lay them flat upon a buttered gridiron, over a clear fire, broiling 
for about six minutes, turning so as to cook both sides. When they are done, place 
them on a dish with a little butter over them and serve. 

Baked Bluefish, Italian Style. 

Score and scale the requisite amount of bluefish and place it in a buttered pan 
with half a wineglassful of white wine, three tablespoonfuls of mushroom liquor, and 
a little very finely chopped onion, six chopped mushrooms, and season with salt and 
pepper ; cover the dish with buttered paper and cook in a moderate oven for fifteen 
minutes, then remove and lay on a dish. Place the liquor in a stewpan, add a gill of 
Spanish sauce, with one wineglassful of white wine, and reduce for two minutes. Pour 
the sauce over the fish, with a little finely chopped parsley, and serve, with fancy 
croutons of bread. 

Bouillabaisse. 

Place a sufficient quantity of mixed fish, such as soles, whiting, gurnet and flound- 
ers into a saucepan, having cut them into pieces, and add some sliced onions, one or 
two sliced carrots, three shallots, two unpicked cloves of garlic, a bunch of thyme and 
parsley, five or six cloves, two bay-leaves, half a teaspoonful of capsicum, a little olive 
oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour into the above mixture a couple of quarts of 
water and boil gently for half an hour, the lid being placed on the pan. When suffi- 
ciently cooked drain the fish and arrange on a hot dish. Then mix a teaspoonful of 
saffron with the soup and pass through a pointed strainer into a soup-tureen. Serve 
the soup with the fish and a plate of croutons of fried bread or sippets of toast. 

Baked Carp. 

Clean a carp and place it in a bowl of salted cold water and vinegar to let it dis- 
gorge. Remove, drain and dry it, stuff with well-seasoned forcemeat, sew up the belly, 
brush it with egg, dredge breadcrumbs over and put on a few small lumps of butter 
here and there. Place the fish in a deep earthenware dish with two onions cut in 
slices and a few sweet herbs, pour over one breakfast cupful each of sweet wine and 
stock, mixing it with one teaspoonful of anchovy sauce or essence, put the dish in a

moderate oven and bake for an hour. Dress the carp carefully on a dish and keep 
it hot, then strain the liquor into a saucepan, add a lump of butter rolled in flour to 
thicken and stir continually over the fire until it is done ; then mix in half a teaspoon- 
ful of sugar, the juice of a lemon and a seasoning of salt and pepper. Pour this into 
a sauceboat and serve. 



Baked Carp, -Mariniere. 



Take a carp weighing from ten to twelve pounds, scale, draw it, and cut a little 
off the fins and fill the inside with forcemeat. Remove a little of the skin from the 
back, leaving the flesh exposed, and lard this with fat bacon ; then truss the head ; 
place the fish on a drainer in a long fishkettle, season it and fill the kettle to about 
half the height of the fish with court bouillon and white wine in the proportion of one 
quart of the former to one-half pint of the latter. Place the kettle on the fire and let 
the liquid boil for five minutes; then remove the carp and put it in a moderate oven 
to bake for about an hour and a half, basting it often. When done, take it out, 
drain, and pour its stock through a sieve, putting the fish back into the kettle again 
to keep hot. Prepare a little brown sauce with the stock, and when clarified and 
strained, put it into a flat stewpan with a handful of mushroom trimmings ; pour in a 
wineglassful of white wine and reduce ; then pass it through a sieve, adding a quarter 
of a pound of good butter. Place the carp on an oval dish and garnish it on both 
sides with a bunch of quenelles of whitings, one of mushrooms and one of blanched 
olives ; glaze the larding with a paste-brush and pour a little sauce over the other 
parts of the fish and a little at the bottom of the dish. Put the soft roes into the 
balance of the sauce and serve in a sauceboat. 

Boiled Carp. 

Clean and wash one or two carp, place them in a saucepan, pour over sufficient 
rich beef gravy to cover, and add a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, four cloves, and 
salt to the taste. Place the saucepan on a moderate fire and cook gently for an hour 
or until the fish is done. Pour into a saucepan a pint of strong beef gravy, with two 
wineglassfuls of white wine; allow this to get hot, and add the strained juice of half 
a lemon. Place the carp on a dish, pour over the hot lemon-flavored liquor and serve 
promptly. 

Pickled Carp. 

After cleaning a carp make as small an opening as possible, tie up the head, put 
the fish in a fish kettle, pour over boiling vinegar, and after a few minutes add a tum- 
blerful of red wine, and a seasoning of two carrots and three onions cut into slices, 
and a small quantity each of sage, thyme, laurel leaves, parsley, cloves and garlic, and 
then set the kettle on the fire and allow it to simmer gently for an hour. Let the fish 
remain in this until it is quite cold, when it will be ready to serve.

Stewed Carp. 

Take a large carp, cut out the gills, but do not remove the tongue; then make 
as small an opening in the under edge as possible in order to open it, and wash it out 
thoroughly. Boil one-half pint of vinegar, and when it is boiling pour it over the fish 
that the scales may drop off easily. Wrap the carp in a cloth and stew it in a court 
bouillon. When done drain it and serve with capers and anchovy sauce, or without 
sauce after soup. 

Catfish Stewed with Tomatoes. 

Slice the fish, each weighing about two ounces, and fry these with a very little 
butter or dripping. When they are partly browned and about half cooked, add one 
breakfast cupful of water, one or two minced green onions, and a pod of red pepper. 
Strain a can of tomatoes over a colander on to the fish, and cook together for half an 
hour, Serve with pieces of dry toast. 

Baked Codfish. 

Take a fresh cod and prepare it by tying up the head with string and filling the 
inside with maitre d'hotel butter, put the fish belly downward on a buttered drainer 
in a fish kettle, and pour over it a mixture made as follows: Melt two pounds of 
butter in a saucepan, add three quarts of chopped mushrooms, two blanched and 
chopped shallots, four tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, the juice of two lemons, a 
crushed clove of garlic, and season to taste ; all of these being partly cooked before 
used. Pour over the fish a pint and a half of white wine, and bring it quickly to a 
boil, then let cook gently for an hour and a half, basting the fish every ten minutes 
with the liquor. When the flesh is firm put the fish on a dish and pour over it half 
the fish stock, putting the rest in a sauce-boat. Any fish sauce may accompany it. 

Baked Codfish with Cream. 

Take the tail of a cod, clean it, and boil in salted water with a little parsley. 
When it is done wipe and open down the back, remove the bones and break the meat 
into pieces. Place these pieces in layers, and between each one a little bechamel 
sauce slightly reduced with cream, also a piece of butter and nutmeg. Sprinkle a 
few breadcrumbs on top and brown it. 

Codfish Balls. 

Take the bone from a piece of fish, make it weigh six ounces, soak in cold 
water, put in a saucepan and boil for half an hour. Pound it to a pulp, being careful 
that all the bones are removed. Boil a half pound of potatoes and when done mash 
them up with the fish, adding a tablespoonful of melted butter and one egg. Make 
this into balls and fry to a light brown. 



52 FISH. 

Boiled Codfish with Cream Sauce. 

Take out the inside of a cod by the white skin of the belly, taking care to remove 
all blood. Place the fish in a kettle with salted cold water and boil fast at first and 
then slowly. When done take out and skin. Pour over it sauce made as follows: 
A quarter pound of butter put in a stew pan with one tablespoonful of flour, moisten 
with a pint of cream, add a little salt and pepper and a teaspoonful of essence of 
anchovies; place the pan on the fire, let thicken but not boil. 

Boiled Codfish with Hollandaise Sauce. 

Take the gills from a cod, also the entrails where the gills form a hole, chop off 
the fins and sprinkle over the fish a little salt, also putting some inside, then place in 
a cold place and let it remain for a few hours. Take it up, wash off the salt, tie the 
head with string, put it in a bowl of water and milk and let it disgorge for about 
three-quarters of an hour. Take it out and drain, put belly downward on a drainer 
in a fish kettle with enough cold salted water to cover it, add three cupfuls of milk 
and boil slowly until the cut begins to open. 

Cleaning Codfish. 

It is usual first to remove the gills by cutting their connection with the rest of 
the head and shoulders and pulling them out. Lay the fish on his back, open the 
belly by cutting down the center, remove the inside, carefully preserving the liver and 
roe, and leaving the sounds uninjured. If the fish is to be cooked whole it should be 
" scored " to the bone transversely at intervals of two inches ; but if it is to be cooked 
in pieces, cut it in slices three inches thick and soak the fish in water for a quarter of 
an hour. Cod is crimped by being cut up and notched with a knife while partly alive; 
but some cooks object to this. The following recipes for cooking cod are carefully 
selected as likely to give sufficient variety to suit all tastes and to all purposes. The 
fish is usually divided, by the fishmonger, into " head and shoulders," " middle " and 
"tail;" but although preference may be given to the middle cut, the tail is quite as 
good, although not so fleshy, and the head yields in quantity the gelatine that makes 
excellent soup. Codlings are for the most part amenable to the same treatment. 

Fillets of Codfish, Hollandaise. 

Take any number of fillets of cod, put in a buttered stewpan, add one gill of 
stock, season, sprinkle a little fine parsley over, and set in the oven, or on the stove, 
with a buttered paper over. When done put them upon a dish, bordered with mashed 
potatoes.

and put in pan with plenty of fat and fry quickly. The tail is best for frying, and 
after removing the skin and bones, cut in slices and press with a cutlet bat. 

Fried Codfish, Maitre d' Hotel. 

Trim a few fillets of cod and dip them in flour. Rub some breadcrumbs through 
a wire sieve, whisk two whole eggs, season, and dip the fillets in the eggs, roll in the

put in a pan and stir. Heat some butter, put the hash in it and let it cook gently. 

Matelote of Codfish. 

Remove the head and bones of a fish, fill the insides with stuffings made from 
half a pint of oysters, one pint of breadcrumbs, a little pepper, a little salt, two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, one egg, half an onion and half a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley. Take six slices of bacon, put three on the bottom and three on the top of 
the fish and bake for an hour, basting with butter and gravy made from the bones 
boiled in water. 

Stewed Codfish. 

Take a piece of boiled fish, remove the skin and bones, and pick into flakes ;

and the juice of a lemon. Put on the fire, and when the contents of the pan are 
quite hot the fish is quite ready to serve. 

Baked Cod's Head. 

Trim and wash well the head of a cod, fill the gills with veal stuffing, put the 
head in a baking dish, season with pepper and salt, also add a little parsley ; moisten 
with a pint of sherry and a little catsup, put a buttered paper over and set in the 
oven to bake. The fish must be well basted while baking, and a pint of stock may 
be added to keep it moist. When the head is nearly done sprinkle it over with fine 
raspings of bread, and when it is quite done put it upon a dish. Add two gills of 
brown sauce to the liquor in the baking pan, strain in a stewpan, and put in a little 
essence of anchovy, two ounces of butter and a little lemon juice ; boil the sauce for 
a few minutes, pour on the cod and serve.

Attelettes of Fish. 

Cut a slice of any fish to a little more than half an inch thick, remove the skin, 
and divide the slice in two, having removed the bone. Cut the slices into very thin 
strips, forming the attelettes, salt, dip them in oil, roll in Hour, and plunge them into 
hot fat to fry. As soon as the flesh is firm, take them out with a skimmer, drain, 
season them with salt, and dish up with a little fried parsley. 

Note that this process is simply one of frying strips of flesh, and may therefore 



58 FISH. 

be applied equally well to almost any kind of fish flesh which may be convenient. 
The hot fat must be hotter than boiling water, and a thick batter may be used instead 
of oil and flour. Anchovy sauce goes well with these fish attelettes. 

For this kind of dish it is well to have small silver skewers, about four inches 
long and of the thickness of a packing needle, with a ring or fancy design on the top, 
the persons eating what is served on them, taking the head of the skewer with the 
thumb and fingers of the left hand and picking it off with a fork. 

Curried Fish. 

Peel and cut two medium-sized onions into thin slices and put in a stewpan with 
a small lump of butter and fry until lightly browned. Pour over them some white 
stock, judging the quantity by that of the fish ; add one ounce of butter and a suf- 
ficient quantity of curry powder ; season with salt, lemon juice, a little sugar and a 
small quantity of cayenne. Boil the stock for fifteen or twenty minutes, then strain 
it into a clean stewpan, skim and put in the fish, having carefully prepared it, and 
boil gently, but without breaking it. Wash and boil about half a pound of rice in 
water ; when cooked it should be dry and have the grains unbroken. Turn the 
curry out on to a hot dish, garnish with croutons of fried bread or sippets of toast, 
and serve very hot, with the rice separate. 

Fish Cutlets. 

Season one pint of any kind of cold cooked fish with salt, pepper and cayenne, 
and make it into paste with a little thick cream sauce, made quite hot. Put the paste 
on a dish to about half an inch in thickness, and when it is cold form it into the 
shapes of cutlets. Put them first into bread or cracker crumbs, then into egg and 
again into crumbs. Fry in a fryingpan of hot fat until brown. If lobster is used, 
insert a small claw at the end of each cutlet, and for other kinds of fish use a small 
piece of thick bone. Drain off the fat and serve. 

Fish Fritters. 

Pick free from all bones a quantity of any kind of cold cooked fish and pound it 
in a mortar; take a small onion, peel and pound it with the fish; season to taste with 
salt and pepper, and add an equal bulk of mashed potatoes, mix well together and 
make all into a paste with beaten egg. Spread the paste out on a board, cut it into 
small pieces about three inches across and fry them in boiling lard to a light brown. 
Fold a napkin over a hot dish and pile the fritters on it. Garnish with fried parsley 
and serve with any kind of fish sauce. 

Fish, Normandy Style. 

Melt in a bakingdish five ounces of butter on the stove or in an oven; sift into 
it one dessertspoonful of chopped parsley, a very little grated nutmeg, a small quan- 



FISH. 59 

tity of salt and black pepper, a very little red pepper, and one tablespoonful of mush- 
room catsup; add five pounds of any kind of fish without skin or bone and cut in 
pieces about four inches long and an inch and a half wide. Pour in three tablespoon- 
fuls of brandy and four tablespoonfuls of white wine, fit the cover on the dish, put a 
flour and water dough round the edge to keep the steam in and bake in a moderate 
oven. Serve very hot. 

Pickled Fish. 

Cut into slices the required quantity of any kind of fish, dust over well with flour 
and put them into a fryingpan with oil to fry. Have in a mortar two or three sprigs 
of mint, one fresh capsicum and salt to taste, and pound well together; pour in slowly 
two breakfast cupfuls of vinegar, turn the whole into a saucepan and boil for five or 
six minutes. Take out the fish and drain it, pour over the hot vinegar. Serve when 
quite cold. 

Baked Flounders. 

Take two flounders, clean and split, and take out all the small bones. Lay the 
fish in a buttered dish and strew over some chopped mushrooms, parsley, green onions 
and rasped breadcrumbs ; season with salt, pepper and a small quantity of grated nut- 
meg. Put a few pieces of butter on the top, and bake. Make a sufficient quantity 
of caper sauce, flavoring it with essence of anchovy and the juice of half a lemon. 
When cooked, drain the butter from the fish, pour over the sauce, and serve. 

Baked Flounders, Italian Style. 

Clean and prepare the fish as for boiling ; put it into an oval-shaped bakingpan 
with one ounce of soft butter spread over it ; pour over half a pint of white wine, and 
season with salt and pepper ; then add three quarters of a pint of Italian sauce and 
sprinkle the top thickly with bread raspings. Place the pan on top of the fire for 
about five minutes to start the boiling, then put it in a moderate oven for a quarter 
of an hour. Serve it in the pan in which it was cooked. 

Boiled Flounders. 

Clean and wash a flounder, make a sharp cut nearly to the bone down the back, 
put it into a fishkettle with sufficient water to cover, add half an ounce of saltpetre 
and four ounces of salt to every gallon of water and simmer gently on the side of the 
fire for six minutes or longer, according to the size of the fish, taking care that it does 
not break. Take it out carefully, spread on a napkin and serve with a sauceboatful 
of melted butter. 

Fricassee of Flounders. 

Take one or two flounders, clean and wash thoroughly; remove the fillets care- 
fully and dust them over with salt and flour, plunge them into boiling fat and fry. 



60 FISH. 

Chop finely one dozen oysters, put them with their liquor into a saucepan, pour in a 
tumblerful of white wine, add three boned anchovies, and salt, pepper and grated 
nutmeg to taste. Let them cook gently for two or three minutes, then put in the 
fillets, give the pan a shake, warm all up together, turn the whole out on to a hot dish 
and serve with slices of lemon for garnish. 

Fried Flounders. 

Clean and prepare as for boiling some small fish, score them over the back and 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip them into milk and cover well with flour; or dip 
them in egg and breadcrumbs, put them into a fryingpan of hot fat and fry for four 
minutes, then bring the fat to the boil and fry for three minutes longer. Take them 
out, drain and dust over with a little salt; garnish with halves of lemon and fried 
parsley and serve on a hot dish. 

Baked Haddock. 

Clean a haddock, remove the eyes, trim it and pass its tail through the cavity of 
the eyes, or the tail may be tied to its mouth. Chop finely two ounces of fat bacon 
and a little green parsley, mix these with two ounces of breadcrumbs, a little salt and 
pepper, a few drops of essence of anchovy, and an egg to make it into a stiff paste. 
Stuff the fish with the mixture and sew it up. Put one tablespoonful of flour in a 
basin, work into it one tablespoonful of cold water, pour on one breakfast cupful of 
boiling water, and mix in one ounce of butter and two tablespoonfuls of essence of 
anchovy. Pour this into a baking tin, put the fish on it, place the pan in a moderate 
oven and bake for an hour, basting frequently, or until done, without its taking color. 
It may be served in the baking tin placed in the dish or taken out and placed on a 
dish; but the fish needs to be handled very carefully or it will break to pieces when 
moved, thus spoiling its appearance. The sauce can be poured round it. A few 
skinned shrimps added to the sauce when it is about half cooked are a great improve- 
ment, and the dish may be garnished with crayfish tails. 

Boiled Haddock with Lobster Sauce. 

Wash the fish, then place it in a fishkettle with boiling water to cover, add one 
tablespoonful of salt, and boil gently for about half an hour. Pick out the flesh of a 
small lobster and cut it into little pieces; put the coral in a mortar with one ounce of 
butter, and pound it. Place three ounces of butter in a small saucepan, with two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, and mix together over the fire until well incorporated; then 
put in the pounded coral, and season with two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice and a 
small quantity of cayenne. Pour in gradually one pint of boiling water, and stir it 
over the fire for ten minutes. Strain the sauce, return it to the saucepan, put in the 
pieces of lobster, and boil it up once. When cooked drain the fish, being careful not

them out, drain, put them on a cloth spread over a dish, and serve with a sauceboat- 
ful of Dutch sauce. 

Haddock, Maitre d'Hotel. 

Clean a haddock and cut it open at the back on each side of the bone, dust 
with salt and pepper, dip it in flour, place on a gridiron over a clear fire and cook for 
about twenty minutes, turning carefully. Put two ounces of maitre d'hotel butter 
on the back of the fish, place it in the oven to melt the butter, then put the fish on a 
dish, pour around two more ounces of butter mixed with six tablespoonfuls of ordi- 
nary butter melted in a saucepan over the fire and made quite hot. 

Baked Smoked Haddock.

the cover on. When done, remove the fish, drain them, place them on a folded 
napkin spread on a dish, garnish with parsley, and serve with oil and vinegar, or any 
fish sauce, in a sauceboat.

Broiled Trout. 

Clean a trout, wipe it carefully, tie it up into shape, cover it over with one table- 
spoonful of salt, mixed with four or five ounces of butter, and let it remain for three 
minutes. Then place it on a gridiron, over a clear fire, and broil it gently for fifteen 
minutes or so. Chop up a well-washed and boned anchovy, stir it up with a little 
melted butter in a saucepan, add one tablespoonful of capers, one dessertspoonful 
of vinegar, and a little salt, pepper and nutmeg. When done, put the trout on a dish ; 
boil the sauce for two or three minutes, pour it over the fish and serve at once. 

Broiled Trout with Bacon. 

Wash and clean a trout well, slit it down the belly and remove the backbone. 
Put a strip of bacon in place of the bone, tie the fish into its original shape, place it 
on a gridiron over a clear fire and broil it. When done place it on a dish, garnish 
with fried parsley and serve. 

Brook Trout. 

All trout should be clean and cooked as quickly as possible after catching, as in 
consequence of the extreme delicacy of the flesh it soon deteriorates after death. 
The recipes following this one may be equally applied to all kinds of trout. 



Croquettes of Trout. 



Cut off the fillets from two cold boiled trout, divide them into squares, cover 
them over with chopped onions and chervil, squeeze over a small quantity of lemon 
juice and roll them up into croquettes, dip them into villeroi sauce, then into egg and 
breadcrumbs twice so as to have them well covered, plunge them into a fryingpan 
of boiling fat and fry them to a good brown color. When done take them out, drain, 
and place them on a napkin spread on a dish and serve with parsley for garnish. 

Fillets of Trout, Aurora. 

Cut the fillets from three trout, form them into any desired shape, place them in 
a sautepan with a little warmed butter, sprinkle over with salt and pepper, and cook 
them quickly over the fire until they are done, turning them often so as to have them 
well done on both sides. Place them on a dish, pour over a quantity of aurora sauce, 
or sauce made red with lobster spawn, and serve without delay. 

Fillets of Trout, Sauted. 

Separate the bones from the fillets, cut each fillet into halves, put them in a buttered 
sautepan, season with salt and pepper and fry them over a brisk fire. Put one-half 
pound of lobster butter into a saucepan, with the yolks of four or five eggs, the juice

of a lemon, and a little salt and pepper, and stir all together over a clear fire till well 
mixed; then pour in one half-pint of melted butter and two teaspoonfuls of essence of 
anchovy. Stir the sauce till thick and on the point of boiling, then move it off the 
fire. When cooked place the fillets on a hot dish, strain the sauce through a fine 
sieve over them and serve. 

Fried Trout. 

Choose small trout, wash and clean them well, and cut off their fins. Season one 
or two tablespoonfuls of flour with salt and pepper, and roll the fish well in it. Put a 
large piece of lard or clarified fat in a stewpan, and place it over the fire; when the 
blue smoke rises put in the fish and fry them until nicely browned. When cooked 
drain them on a sheet of kitchen paper in front of a clear fire, then place them on a hot 
dish over which has been spread an ornamental dish-paper, or a folded napkin, garnish 
with fried parsley and serve. 

Trout, Hussar Style. 

Scale and clean a trout, draw it by the gills, and stuff it with butter mixed up 
with finely-chopped sweet herbs. In stuffing great care must be exercised to see that 
the skin is not broken. Rub the fish well with warmed butter or oil, sprinkle it over 
well with pepper and salt, put it on a gridiron over a clear fire, and broil it ; or it 
may be put in a dish in the oven and baked. Place it on a dish when done and 
serve with poivrade sauce, in a sauceboat. 

Trout in Papers. 

Take half a dozen trout of one-fourth pound each in weight, and stuff them with 
fish forcemeat. Oil as many pieces of paper as there are fish, place a slice of salt 
pork on either end of each piece, lay a trout on top, sprinkle over a little salt and 
pepper, fold the paper and tie it securely with a string. Cook in a baking-dish in a 
moderate oven for twenty minutes or so, and serve them in their envelopes, after 
removing the strings, with any sauce desired in a sauceboat. 

Trout, Venetian Style. 

Scale and clean a large trout, wash and dry it well, score it across the back and 
insert in the openings some butter highly seasoned with minced basil, lemon thyme, 
chives, and parsley. Put the trout in a dish, pour over salad oil to cover it, and let 
it remain for half an hour; then remove it, sprinkle over sifted breadcrumbs stirred 
in with a small quantity of chopped herbs, place it on a gridiron over a clear fire, 
and broil it for fifteen minutes or so, or until it is done. Place it on a dish and serve 
with orange sauce in a sauceboat. 



88 FISH. 

Trout with Remoulade. 

Select some medium-sized trout and fry them in butter; when cooked place them 
for a minute on a sheet of kitchen paper, in order to drain off as much of the fat as 
possible. Chop in moderate quantities some chives, capers, parsley, chervil, water- 
cress and a small quantity of shallots; then pound these in a mortar and mix in one 
teaspoonful of French mustard, the beaten yolks of two eggs and one teacupful of 
salad oil. The oil must be mixed in drop by drop, so that it may incorporate thor- 
oughly with the other ingredients. When the sauce is perfectly smooth mix in a 
small quantity of chili vinegar. Spread an ornamental dish-paper or a folded napkin 
over a dish, lay the trout on it, garnish round with parsley and serve with the sauce 
in a sauceboat. 

Baked Turbot. 

Clean and wash a small turbot, place it on a dish, pour over a small quantity of 
hot butter, sprinkle with a little finely-chopped parsley, powdered mace, salt and pep- 
per, and allow it to remain for an hour. Lift the fish up carefully and place it in a 
baking dish. Brush it over with egg, then cover with sifted breadcrumbs, set it in 
the oven and bake. When done remove, put it on a dish and serve with any desired 
fish sauce. 

Boiled Turbot with Lobster Sauce. 

Place a turbot in a fish kettle with a bunch of parsley, a lump of salt, plenty of 
cold water and the juice of two large lemons. When the water begins to boil move 
the kettle to the side of the fire and let it simmer until the fish is tender. Have pre- 
pared the following sauce: Pick the meat from a hen lobster and cut it into moder- 
ate-sized pieces; place the shell and spawn in a mortar with a lump of butter and 
pound it until smooth, then pass it through a fine hair sieve. Make three-fourths of 
a pint of butter sauce, put the pieces of lobster in it, and season it with a very small 
quantity of cayenne pepper. When the sauce boils stir in the pounded mixture and 
one teacupful of cream, and move the pan to the edge of the fire. When the turbot 
is cooked drain it well, lay it on a hot dish over which has been spread a folded nap- 
kin, place a border of fresh green parsley round the dish and then a circle of quarters 
of lemon. Serve the fish while hot with the sauce in a sauceboat. The fish does not 
require much boiling. 

Broiled Trout. 

Clean and wipe the fish quite dry, split it down the back and let it soak for 
nearly an hour in warm butter with chopped sweet herbs, salt, pepper and parsley ; 
then cover it with sifted breadcrumbs and broil it over a clear fire. Serve with 
lemon juice or orange juice squeezed over.

Fillets of Turbot with Cream Sauce. 

Separate the fillets from the bones of some cooked turbot, skin them, leave till 
cold, then cut them into collops. Put one tablespoonful of flour into a stewpan with 
four ounces of butter and one-half teacupful of cream, a pinch of cayenne pepper 
and a small quantity of glaze ; season to taste with salt, stir the sauce over the fire 
until it is thick, then remove it to the side and put in the fillets of turbot. Turn the 
turbot and sauce on to a hot dish and serve. If preferred, the mixture can be served 
in a vol-au-vent. 

Turbot with Black Butter. 

Remove the skin and bones from some cold cooked turbot and cut the fish into 
nice sized pieces. Put a large piece of butter into a stewpan and boil it until it 
comes to be of a dark color ; then put in a moderate quantity of finely-chopped 
parsley and one wineglassful of tarragon vinegar. Season to taste with pepper and 
salt. Put the fish into the sauce and keep it at the side of the fire until heated 
through and through. Turn the fish with the butter on to a hot dish and serve. 

Vol-au-Vent of Fish, Normandy. 

Prepare a puff paste with one pound each of flour and butter and one ounce of 
salt. Roll the paste out to a thickness of about three-fourths of an inch, and cut it 
round to the size of the dish on which it is to be served. Place the flat of paste on 
a baking sheet, brush it over with beaten egg, and cut a circle through the middle 
about one-fourth of an inch deep, leaving an edge about one inch wide all round. 
Bake the paste in a moderate oven, and when cooked lift up the center piece which 
will have risen ; scoop out the uncooked paste, brush the inside with beaten egg, and 
place it in an oven for five minutes longer. Prepare a filling of scalloped fillets of 
soles, mussels, oysters and sliced mushrooms. Mix the cooking liquor of the mussels 
with some lean veloute sauce, boil it until somewhat reduced, then thicken it with 
the beaten yolks of two eggs. Mix the sauce with the garnishing, place the cover of 
paste on, stand it on the dish it was made to fit, and serve. 

Deviled Whitebait. 

Wash the fish, drain well on a sieve, dry them in a soft cloth and then drop them on 
a well-floured cloth, carefully rolling each little fish over in it, so that they shall all be 
nicely and evenly floured. Put them immediately into a frying-basket, and dip them 
into extremely hot boiling lard ; hold it there for a very short time, lift the basket 
out of the lard, and dust the fish over with black pepper and a small quantity of salt ; 
some cooks dip them again into the boiling lard for a second, remove them, sprinkle 
with cayenne pepper, and serve. 



9 o FISH. 

Fried Whitebait. 

Wash the fish, drain well on a wire sieve, dry them in a soft cloth, and then drop 
them, when quite dry, on to a well-floured cloth, rolling each fish carefully in it. 
Put them immediately into a frying basket, dip them into extremely hot lard, hold 
it there until the fish is crisp, which will be before it browns, take it out while still 
white, and serve as quickly as possible on a napkin laid on a hot dish, and garnish 
with fried parsley, and quarters of lemon. Serve with them cayenne, grated lemo i 
peel and thin slices of brown bread and butter. 

Baked Fillets of Whitefish. 

Scale some large whitefish, split them, remove the backbone, season the fille* > 
with salt and pepper, and dip them in beaten egg, then in breadcrumbs, and again in 
beaten egg, then in breadcrumbs, and again in beaten egg. Put a lump of fresh 
lard in a baking dish, heat it, and then put in the fillets. Bake the fish in the oven 
for twenty minutes, until they are lightly colored. When cooked, drain the grease 
off the fillets, place them on a hot dish, garnish with fried parsley, and serve with 
potatoes and a sauceboatful of parsley sauce. 



Shell-Fish. 

Clam Fritters. 

Place some fresh clams into one pan, and the liquor from them into another. 
Prepare a mixture of broken crackers and flour in equal quantities, and dip the 
clams first into their own liquor and then into this, repeating this operation three 
times ; finally dipping them into milk, and then again into the flour mixture. Have 
prepared some boiling lard, drop in a few clams at a time, let them fry for about five 
minutes ; then remove them with a skimmer, place them on a strainer, drain away the 
fat, and they are ready to be served. The pan containing the lard should be so deep 
that the clams will be covered when put in. 

Scalloped Clams. 

Wash thoroughly six or eight good sized clam shells, fill them with clam force- 
meat, flatten them with the hand, spread over sifted breadcrumbs, smooth with the 
blade of a knife, and moisten with a little clarified butter. Arrange them on a baking 
pan and bake until they are well browned, or for about six minutes. Place them on 
a hot dish, and serve at once, with sprigs of parsley for garnish. 

Steamed Clams. 

Scrub the shells of some clams well in water ; then place them in a saucepan 
without any water, place them over the fire, and cook until the shells open. Remove 
the clams with a skimmer, pour the liquor into a jar and let it settle. 'There will be 
no use in straining the liquor through the finest strainer, but a piece of linen may be 
used, or if allowed to settle, and care be taken not to move the sediment, the water 
can be poured off. Remove the clams from their shells, pulling off the thin skin 
round the edge, and cutting off the whole of the black end with a pair of scissors. 
Plunge each clam into a small quantity of the liquor, and if at all tough cut that part 
through. When the water has settled pour it into a saucepan, add the clams and 
make it hot, though do not allow it to boil. Take out the clams and serve with brown 
bread and butter, toasted crackers, or on pieces of buttered toast. 

Stewed Clams. 

Remove about three dozen small clams from their shells, place them with two 
ounces of fresh butter into a stewpan, one pinch of chives and one pinch of finely 



92 SHELL-FISH. 

chopped chervil, adding one-half breakfast cupful of water, so that it may not be too 
salt; also a small pinch of pepper and two tablespoonfuls of sifted breadcrumbs, and 
boil for two minutes. Turn all out on to a dish and serve with the juice of half a 
lemon squeezed over. 

Little-Neck Clams Served Raw. 

Wash a number of these clams in water, scrubbing them with a brush, wipe them 
dry on a cloth, open and cut them clear from their shells. Place five on a plate on 
the half shells, placing half a lemon in the center of the plate, and serve with crack- 
ers and a small dish of finely chopped cold cabbage. 



Soft Clams, Ancient Style. 



Take a dozen nice, large, soft clams, wash them well and open them, keeping 
only one part of the shell with the clam. Put a piece of butter on each clam and 
plenty of Paprika pepper and a little strip of raw bacon. Put the clams on a roast- 
ing pan, which place in a hot oven for about ten minutes and serve it on the pan 
in which the clams have been cooked. 

Fried Soft Clams. 

Thoroughly wash one bunch or one pint of soft clams taken out of their shells 
in cold water to free them from sand and lay them separately on a towel to dry ; 
have ready a frying kettle about half full of fat and place this over the fire. While 
the fat is heating, prepare a dish of beaten raw eggs and a platter full of bread- 
crumbs or cracker dust; roll the clams in the crumbs, then dip them in the beaten 
eggs ; roll thern once more in crumbs, and when the fat is smoking hot, place them 
in it and fry to a golden brown. Take them out with a skimmer, lay them on brown 
paper to drain off the fat and serve hot. They may be sent to the table with a gar- 
nish of lemon cut in quarters or a dish of sliced fresh or pickled cabbage. 



Soft Clams, Newburg. 



Thoroughly clean and remove all sand from about forty to forty-five soft fresh 
clams, place them in a stewpan with one ounce of butter, half a pinch of white 
pepper, a wineglassful of Madeira wine and a couple of well-hashed truffles, place on 
the lid and cook gently for about eight minutes ; then break three egg yolks into a 
bowl, add a pint of sweet cream and beat thoroughly for about three minutes, then 
pour it over the clams, stir gently the clams for three minutes longer and pour them 
into a hot tureen, sending to table at once. 



SHELL-FISH. 93 

Stewed Soft Clams. 

Thoroughly wash about three and a half dozen of fresh soft clams so that no sand 
remains on them after they are opened, lay them carefully on the palm of the left 
hand, and with the right hand remove the body with care, but nothing more, being 
cautious not to break it and throwing away all the other parts. When all are pre- 
pared place them in a stewpan with one ounce of butter, a small pinch of white pepper, 
one wineglassful of Madeira wine and two finely-hashed medium sized truffles ; place 
the cover on the pan and cook gently for seven or eight minutes. Break the yolks of 
three eggs into a bowl, add one pint of sweet cream and beat well for three minutes. 
Pour this over the clams and toss the saucepan for about three minutes more very 
gently to thoroughly mix the clams with -the cream but not letting the liquor boil 
again. Neither fork nor spoon should ever be used in mixing them. Pour the whole 
into a hot dish and serve at once. 

Crabs. 

Crabs are in season from April to September, and in May they lose entirely the 
dryness of flesh for which they are noted during the winter months. The richest 
flavored crabs are those of medium size, say from six to ten inches in their broadest 
diameter. They should be boiled alive, being plunged into cold water, and, as the 
water warms, a handful or so of salt should be thrown in upon them, and when the 
water has been boiling for twenty minutes or half an hour, according to the size of 
the crabs, they may be considered sufficiently cooked. If placed in hot water at 
first, they are apt to throw off their claws by a violent jerk, and then the water would 
soak into the flesh and make it sloppy. After the salt is thrown in, the scum which 
rises to the top of the water should be carefully skimmed off. The claws of large 
crabs should be tied to prevent their opening and pinching or injuring each other. 
Crabs are usually sold ready boiled, which is, of course, a great convenience to the 
cook, whose next care is that of selection. The best crabs are always heavy, accord- 
ing to size ; the claws and legs should be all on. They should be firm and stiff, and 
the eyes bright rather than dull. The male crab has larger claws than the female, 
but less body in proportion, therefore selection should depend upon whether the pref- 
erence leans to white meat or to the more mellow liver and creamy fat which sur- 
rounds it. The female also has a much broader tail than the male. 

Buttered Crab. 

Remove the meat from a large boiled crab, cut it up small and mix with bread- 
crumbs and chopped parsley, having about a third of the bulk of the crab meat. 
Season and put a few pieces of butter over it ; pack it back in the shell, pour over a 
little lemon juice, cover with a layer of sifted breadcrumbs, place a few more lumps 
of butter on the top, set in a slow oven and cook until done.

Crab Croquettes. > 

Remove the meat from the shells of two medium-sized crabs, and chop it fairly 
fine. Melt in a saucepan three ounces of butter, and stir into this three ounces of 
flour. Add gradually one-half pint of milk, stir until it boils, and then allow it to 
cook for ten minutes; remove the saucepan from the stove, and to the hot milk, flour 
and butter add the chopped meat of the crabs, one saltspoonful of pepper, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, a small quantity of cayenne (not more than would lie on the end of 
a small knife blade), mix thoroughly together, turn the whole out on to a plate and 
let it cool; when it is fairly cold make it into little rolls nearly three inches long, and 
egg and breadcrumb these by brushing them all over with beaten egg and then rolling 
in breadcrumbs. Fry them in hot lard or clarified fat for two minutes, or until they 
are a nice golden brown, allow them to drain on a sheet of paper for an instant and 
serve on a folded napkin with a little fried parsley for garnish. 

Deviled Crabs. 

Put one-half pound of butter into a saucepan with one tablespoonful of flour, and 
cook together, stirring it continually to prevent its burning; add to it one large tumbler- 
ful of rich cream, one boiled soft onion mashed to a paste or pulp, a little grated nut- 
meg, and season with salt and cayenne pepper. Then put in the crab meat, enough 
to fill eight crab shells and a raw egg or two, stir all together well and cook until it 
begins to thicken, which will only take a few minutes; then pour it all on a flat dish 
and allow it to stand until cold. Now fill the back crab shells with the mixture, egg 
them over with a brush and cover with grated breadcrumbs or cracker dust. Place 
them in a bakingpan, put a small lump of butter on top of each, and bake in a slow 
oven to a light brown color, or fry them in plenty of hot lard. 

Crabs in Shells. 

Boil a few crabs, pick out the meat and place the coral on one side. Chop up 
the meat, add to it one onion, ground ginger, lemon juice, mushroom catsup, salt and 
pepper ; put the mixture into a fryingpan with butter and cook until the butter is 
absorbed. Pour in a little stock, boil until nearly evaporated, then remove the pan 
from the fire. Butter five of the crab shells and fill them with the mixture. Grind 
the coral, mingle it with some breadcrumbs, sprinkle this over the mixture, put a few 
small lumps of butter on the tops, place the shells in the oven, and bake for a few 
minutes. 

Minced Crabs. 

Place the finely chopped meat of three crabs into a saucepan, pour over one wine- 
glassful of white wine and one of vinegar, and season to taste with salt, pepper, and 
cayenne pepper. Cook over a moderate fire for about ten minutes, and add two 



SHELL-FISH. 95 

ounces of warmed butter, mixed with one boned anchovy, and stir in the well beaten 
yolks of two eggs. Sprinkle in sufficient breadcrumbs to thicken properly, turn the 
whole out on to a dish, and serve with parsley for a garnish. 



Crabs, Queen Style. 



Pick about a dozen hard-shell boiled crabs into as large pieces as possible ; 
mix them in a salad bowl, with one-half breakfast cupful of sliced celery or shredded 
lettuce, one-half pinch of pepper, one pinch of salt, one tablespoonful of olive oil, and 
one and one-half tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Refill six well cleaned shells with the 
salad, and on each one lay one tablespoonful of mayonnaise sauce ; and sprinkle over 
with chopped hard boiled egg, the yolk separated from the white, some crab or lob- 
ster coral, and one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, every article to be used sepa- 
rately in order that each color may be distinct. Serve on a dish with a folded 
napkin, or ornamental dish-paper. 

Crab Ravigote. 

Boil some large hard-shell crabs, after which put them aside to become cold. 
Then turn them over on the hard shell side and with a sharp knife cut the breast 
away. Pick the meat off, clean it nicely, being careful not to leave any pieces of 
shell in it, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Mix with thick remoulade sauce 
and fill up one of the shells, which has previously been washed clean, with the mix- 
ture. The meat of two good-sized crabs so treated will be sufficient to fill the inside 
of one shell. Cover the meat with mayonnaise and decorate with fillet of anchovy 
and sliced pickles. Serve on a folded napkin with branches of parsley and quartered 
lemon. 

Stewed Crabs. 

Take eight live crabs and steam for twenty minutes; pick out the meats, put it 
in a saucepan with one-half pint of milk or cream and stew for fifteen or twenty min- 
utes. Season with cayenne pepper and salt. 

Broiled Soft-Shell Crabs. 

Dip some soft-shell crabs into melted butter and season with pepper and salt. 
Then put them on the fire and broil them until the shells are slightly brown. As 
soon as they are done serve them hot with melted butter or lemon juice or with a 
lemon cut into quarters. Slices of hot dry toast may be laid under them 

Fried Soft-Shell Crabs. 

Have a dish of cracker dust mixed with a little pepper and on the stove a pan 
half full of smoking hot fat; beat two eggs, roll the crabs in the crumbs and dip them

in the eggs, then roll them again in the crumbs and put in the hot fat to fry. Take 
them out with a skimmer, lay on brown paper to free them from grease and serve 
them while hot. 

Stewed Soft-Shell Crabs with Okras. 

Brown in a saucepan with one-half ounce or so of butter a chopped onion, an 
ounce or more of raw ham cut into dice, half of a green pepper pod, also cut into 
dice, one-half tablespoonful of salt and one teaspoonful of pepper. Moisten with 
about one quart of white broth or consomme, add a tablespoonful of uncooked rice, 
six sliced okras, also a sliced tomato. Allow all these to cook thoroughly for about 
twenty minutes, and five minutes before serving add the meat of three well-washed, 
minced, soft-shell crabs. 

Fried Oyster Crabs. 

Wash and dry about one and one-half pints of oyster crabs, dip them first in 
flour, and then in cold milk, and finally in cracker dust or well sifted breadcrumbs. 
Shake them up well in a colander, and fry in hot fat for two or three minutes. Serve 
in croustades made of short paste, garnish with parsley, and sprinkle a little salt over 
before serving. 

Stewed Oyster Crabs, Poulette Style. 

Remove all the meat from a pint and a half of oyster crabs, put it into a sauce- 
pan, pouring on a little of their liquor, and add to this one ounce of butter, pepper 
and salt ; parboil for three or four minutes, add carefully one breakfast cupful of 
Hollandaise sauce, stew for two or three minutes longer, but do not boil, add the 
juice of half a lemon and one teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley ; stir gently, and 
it will then be ready for use. 

Crayfish Boiled in Court Bouillon. 

Put some butter in a stewpan, and add a little celery root, onion and leek, all 
finely minced, place the pan on a moderate fire and fry them. Then add a little 
white wine, salt, a small bunch of parsley, and a few peppercorns. Boil for seven or 
eight minutes, and then throw in twenty-five live crayfish; cover over the pan and 
boil for eight minutes longer. Toss them in the pan a little, remove, place on a 
strainer to drain, and then on a dish. Strain the liquid, reduce it by boiling to half 
its original quantity, add a small piece of butter, and pour it over. 

Crayfish, Bordelaise Style. 

Place two dozen selected crayfish in a pan with water and a little milk mixed, 
and allow them to soak for two or three hours; then remove them and place on a 
strainer to drain. In the meantime make a good mirepoix of vegetables with Bor- 



SHELL-FISH. 97 

deaux wine, and add to the liquor a bunch of parsley, a slice of raw ham, one small 
wineglassful of cognac, two or three tablespoonfuls of Madeira and a little salt. Put 
the lid on the stewpan, place it on the fire, and let boil five or seven minutes; when it. 
is boiling hot throw in the crayfish, and leave for ten minutes, after which pour the 
liquor through a sieve; reduce it to half, adding slowly one pint of veloute sauce. 
When sufficiently reduced strain it through a cloth into another pan, and stir in one- 
fourth pound of good butter, a small piece of crayfish butter, and one tablespoonful 
of finely chopped parsley. Remove the small claws, put them in a group in the center 
of the dish, and arrange the bodies round, garnishing all with a few sprigs of parsley. 
The sauce must be served separately. 

Crayfish Mariniere. 

Remove the small claws from a dozen or two of crayfish, place them in a stew- 
pan, and boil with wine until done. Drain off the liquor, allow it to settle, and then 
pass it through a fine sieve to clarify it. Take an onion, chop it up finely, and fry 
gently so that it does not color at all. Pour on a little of the crayfish liquor and also 
a little wine, and boil for three minutes. Next put in a lump of butter worked into 
some breadcrumbs and finely-chopped parsley to thicken it, and finally add a little 
cayenne and the juice of a lemon. Place the crayfish on a dish and pour the sauce 
over. 

Crayfish Patties. 

Place two dozen crayfish into a stewpan with a little salt, a few peppercorns, 
some finely chopped vegetables, a bunch of parsley and a little vinegar or white wine ; 
cover over the pan, place it on a good fire and when the fish have cooled a little re- 
move the meat from the tails and claws and cut it up into small pieces, placing them 
in a small stewpan and thickening with a little white sauce. When wanted for serving 
fill a dozen or so of (bouchees) patties with the preparation and garnish with lobster 
coral and parsley. 

Timbale of Crayfish. 

In order to have this dish sufficient for a large party a great number of crayfish 
are required for it. Having picked out the tails of something like one hundred and 
fifty crayfish, brush each "one over with some warmed crayfish butter. Have ready 
some very c'vear savoury jelly and a large timbale mould ; warm the jelly to the liquid 
state, pick up each tail with a larding needle and dip into the jelly ; then arrange them 
neatly around the mould ; the jelly will cause them to adhere. When the top is 
reached (remember the mound will be upside down and should be packed in ice) 
leave the jelly fixing the tails to set. Pick out all the meat from the claws and bodies 
and chop up very finely ; mix this mince with enough warm jelly to fill the timbale 
and leave that also to set. When the jelly is firm, dip the mould for an instant in tepid 



9 8 SHELL-FISH. 

water, wipe it and then turn the timbale out on to a dish. Garnish with croutons of 
jelly and an attelette decorated with truffles. 

Edible Snails. 

Snails are cleaned by placing them in boiling water with some wood ashes and 
leaving them until they have thrown their cover wide open which will take about a quar- 
ter of an hour ; they should then be removed and picked carefully out of their shells 
with a fork. Put them in a basin of tepid water and leave for two or three hours. 
Afterwards rub them well in the hands and wash them in several changes of cold 
water, The shells are put in warm water, scrubbed with a brush and then wiped dry. 

Baked Edible Snails. 

Work one tablespoonful of chopped parsley into two ounces of butter, and season 
with one saltspoonful of salt, one-half saltspoonful of pepper, and a small quantity 
of grated nutmeg. Put a piece of the prepared butter into each of the shells (there 
should be about twenty-five shells for the above quantity of butter), then put a snail 
into each of the shells, and another piece of butter on top. Lay the snails close 
together in a cast iron pan, the mouths of the snails upwards, and not one upon 
another ; cover the pan so as to render it air tight, and put it into a moderate oven. 
When the parsley begins to look dark, the snails will be sufficiently cooked. Arrange 
the snails on a hot dish with a folded napkin, leaving them in their shells, and serve 
as hot as possible.

pepper tied in a cloth, and salt to taste ; cook until the snails fall from their 
shells, empty them, clipping off their tails, and cleaning the shells well. Mix together 
some shallots, parsley and butter, and chervil chopped very fine ; put this into a bowl 
with an equal quantity of sifted breadcrumbs and one wineglassful of white wine, 
season to taste with pepper and salt, and knead well. Partly fill the shells with this 
mixture, replace the snails, and complete the filling with more of the kneaded butter ; 
spread breadcrumbs over, and lay them on a baking dish, the opened part on the top. 
Brown in the oven for four minutes, and serve on a dish with a folded napkin.

the mussels and serve at once. The mussels may be previously pickled, but it is not 
necessary. 

Mussels in Shells. 

Procure some small mussels, they being the most delicate, scrape the shells and 
wash them in several waters, to remove all the grit. Put the mussels in a stewpan 
with one sliced onion, a small bunch of parsley, and one pint of French white wine ; 
season with pepper and salt, stand the pan over the fire till the shells open, when the 
mussels will be done. Take them cut of their shells, clean thoroughly, and cut them 
into halves ; strain the cooking liquor of the mussels into another saucepan, mix with 
it an equal quantity of veloute sauce, and boil until reduced to about half of its 
original quantity. Thicken the sauce with a lump of butter or a liaison of two yolks 
of eggs, stirring by the side of the fire and not allowing it to boil after the eggs are 
added ; put the mussels in the sauce with one tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Fill 
some silver shells with the above mixture, cover with finely grated breadcrumbs, put 
a small bit of butter on the top of each, and brown in the oven ; when cooked, arrange

hot dish, garnish with neat sprigs of fried parsley, arranging it here and there between 
the shells, and serve. 

Mussels, Matelote. 

Wash and clean some mussels, put them into a saucepan over a clear fire, and 
toss or hustle them until the shells open. Turn the mussels into a colander placed 
over a pan, so as to save all their liquor, and remove the half shells, beards, etc. ; 
put two tablespoonfuls of chopped shallots and a clove of garlic into a saucepan with 
a little butter, and fry without letting them take color ; put in the mussels, pour over 
one wineglassful of wine and the mussel liquor, place the pan over the fire, boil for a

shell that does not contain the fish, take off the beard and weed, remove any young 
crabs there may be, and put them on a dish either piled up or packed closely together. 
In the meantime prepare a little melted butter, made with the mussel liquor instead 
of water and a good quantity of butter, and sprinkle over a little pepper and sufficient 
vinegar to give it a sharp taste ; make this mixture hot, pour it over the mussels and 
serve at once. Nutmeg, mace, or chopped parsley and chives may be added to the 
sauce if desired to heighten the flavor.

Scalloped Mussels. 

Put some mussels into a saucepan and toss them over a quick fire for a few 
minutes until the meat will come away easily from the shells. Take out the beards, 
weeds, etc., remove the fish from their shells, squeeze all the liquor out of them, 
and add to it that which came from them while being cooked : strain it into a sauce- 
pan, put in the mussels and warm them up, adding a little flour, butter, grated nut- 
meg and pepper ; care must be taken not to let them boil and not to use any salt, as 
they generally contain sufficient. Clean some scallop shells, cover them with bread- 
crumbs, put a layer of the mussels over it, then another layer of breadcrumbs and 
another of mussels ; moisten them with a few tablespoonfuls of the liquor, put a 
layer of crumbs on top, place on it a few pieces of butter, scatter over a little dried 
parsley, and put them in an oven to cook until they are a bright brown. They may 
be browned in a salamander instead of the oven, if desired, and must be served hot.

the shells open, then turn them into a colander over a pan and let them drain. 
Pull them out of their shells, and when they are cool dip them into a little villeroy 
sauce ; arrange on a baking sheet, and when the sauce has cooled sprinkle them 
over with breadcrumbs, repeating it to have them thoroughly covered. Plunge 
them into a fryingpan of boiling fat, fry to a light brown color, then take them out, 
drain, put them on a napkin on a dish, and serve with a garnish of fried parsley. 

Oysters. 

Oysters are in season eight months in the year, .he four " close " months being 
May, June, July, and August; the other months having the letter " r " in their spell- 
ing, accounts for the saying that oysters are in season when there is an " r " in the 
month. The oyster (ostrea edulis) is found on almost every coast, being especially 



io8 SHELL-FISH. 

cultivated in certain localities, and yielding enormous crops, as it is estimated that 
one oyster alone produces in one year from three to four thousand young. The 
system of cultivation has been brought to great perfection, and the superior kinds of 
oysters are carefully preserved from contamination with inferior sorts. Of the 
numerous kinds of oysters sold in our markets, it is only necessary to state that those 
possessing the smallest, smoothest and cleanest looking shells, from the high class 
native, down to the lowest types, are the best flavored. For serving plain, no oyster 
excels the blue points, but for cooking a coarser and cheaper kind may be used with 
almost as good results. Oysters must be kept alive, and as they are liable to fret and 
waste in substance while in captivity, they require frequent change of water, and 
occasional feeding or fattening as it is called. The following is the system usually 
adopted: Take some fresh oysters, put them in a tub of water, wash or scrub them 
with a birch or heather broom until they are quite clean, then lay them in an earthen- 
ware pan with the flat shell upwards; sprinkle them with flour or oatmeal, and cover 
with salted water (quite as salt as sea- water), bay salt being the best for this purpose. 
Change the salt water every day and sprinkle the oysters with oatmeal or flour, and 
they will fatten. Sometimes it is necessary to preserve oysters for culinary use, 
especially in localities where they are scarce or the supplies insufficient. When this 
is the case, the following will be found an excellent method of preparing them so that 
they will keep good, although not fresh, and be always ready for use. 

Clean the oysters thoroughly, put them in a large saucepan with some sea-water, 
the juice of half a lemon, and some grated nutmeg. When the water is on the point 
of boiling move the saucepan off the fire, and leave the oysters in the liquor till the 
following day. Put them into stone or earthenware jars, pour over some clarified 
butter, and when cold, cover and tie the jars down; keep them in a cool place. 
Oysters should be kept in a very cold place, and should be thoroughly washed before 
they are opened; they should, according to the French custom, be opened on the 
deep shell so as to preserve their liquor; it is then advisable, if possible, to lay them 
on a bed of finely chopped ice for an hour or so before serving; this improves the 
flavor greatly, but they must not be left on the ice much longer, for after that time 
they will begin to lose flavor, instead of gaining it. 

Oysters, American Style. 

Place in a sauce bowl one heaped teaspoonful of salt, three-fourths teaspoonful 
of very finely ground white pepper, one medium sized fine, sound, well peeled shallot, 
one heaped teaspoonful of chives, and one-half teaspoonful of parsley, all very finely 
chopped. Mix lightly together, and then pour in one teaspoonful of olive oil, six 
drops of Tobasco sauce, one saltspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, and lastly one gill 
(or five and one-half tablespoonfuls) of good vinegar. Mix it thoroughly with a 
spoon, and it is ready for use. A teaspoonful should be poured over each oyster just 
before eating.

ness, and with a fluted tin cutter, about two inches in diameter, cut eighteen rounds 
out of the paste. Arrange the pieces of paste on a baking sheet, let them rest on ice 
for ten minutes, then brush over with beaten egg, and with a plain tin cutter one and 
one-fourth inches in diameter cut through the center of each bouchee to about one- 
third of the thickness of the paste. Bake the bouchees in a quick oven, and when 
cooked lift off the inner circle of the paste and hollow them out inside. Fill the 
bouchees with the salpicon of oysters and mushrooms and replace the covers. Place 
a folded napkin or an ornamental dish-paper on a hot dish, arrange the bouchees on 
it, garnish with fried parsley and serve.

Broiled Oysters. 

Take some fine large-sized oysters, lay them on a soft cloth to dry, pepper over, 
and then place them on a well buttered gridiron over a clear fire and leave till thor- 
oughly hot. Lay them then on slices of well buttered toast cut rather thin and serve 
while hot. 

Broiled Oysters, Breaded. 

Take freshly opened oysters and an equal quantity of bread and cracker crumbs, 
flatten them on a well greased broiler and broil for two minutes on each side. Salt 
slightly and arrange on the toast, then lightly glaze them over with maitre d'hotel 
sauce and serve. 

Broiled Oysters, in the Shell. 

Put a couple of dozen large oysters on a gridiron over a moderate fire, with the 
flat shell uppermost; when done they will open. Keep the liquor in the shells and 
serve hot. 



Oyster Cocktail. 



Open half a dozen small oysters and drop them with the juice into a wine glass; 
add a little lemon juice, three drops of Tobasco sauce, a teaspoonful of Worcester- 
shire sauce and one dessertspoonful of tomato catsup, stir well and serve. Horse- 
radish may be served on the side. 



Oyster Cromeskies. 



Scald the required number of oysters in their own liquor and put them between 
slices of bacon cut very thin. Two oysters are quite sufficient for one slice of bacon. 
Roll the bacon over and fasten the oysters in with a small skewer. Fry them to a 
nice brown, place them on a dish and serve hot. 

Oyster Croquettes. 

Blanch six dozen oysters, trim and chop the meat into small pieces, put these 
into a saucepan with one-third the bulk of mushrooms cooked and cut into small 
pieces. Set one pint of bechamel sauce in a saucepan over a clear fire, reduce it, 
stirring frequently, add a few tablespoonfuls of the oyster liquor and a little cream. 
When it is well reduced and begins to froth, add a liaison made of the yolks of three 
eggs to thicken it, and lastly add a small quantity of butter. Stir in the oyster mix- 
ture, turn it out into a basin, and let it get quite cold, placing the basin if necessary 
on ice. Take out small quantities, about the size of an egg, roll them on a board 
sprinkled with breadcrumbs, make them round with spoons, and dip them first into 
well beaten egg and then into breadcrumbs. Have ready a fryingpan of boiling fat, 



SHELL-FISH. in 

plunge them in a few. at a time, and when they are done and of a good color take them 
out, drain, arrange them on a napkin spread over a dish, and serve with a garnish of 
fried parsley. 

Oyster Croustade. 

Beard and cut some oysters into halves and put in a stewpan with their strained 
liquor, one wineglassful of white wine, and a moderate quantity of gravy; season to 
taste with salt, pepper, and a small quantity each of grated lemon peel and pounded 
mace. Stew them gently, and when done place in them about one ounce of butter in 
small lumps. Cut off the tops of some small French rolls, scooping out the crumb, 
and put them into a stewpan of boiling butter, and fry until crisp and brown. Rub 
the crumbs of the rolls up finely and fry them also. Drain the rolls and fill them 
with the oyster mixture, placing on a hot dish with the crumbs around it, and serve. 



Curried Oysters. 



Peel and cut into thin slices a moderate sized Spanish onion; put a lump of 
butter into a stewpan, place it over the fire, and when the butter boils put in the onion 
and fry it until nicely browned. Next stir in three tablespoonfuls of curry powder, 
add more butter if necessary, and mix well over the fire. Pour in gradually a 
sufficient quantity of broth, put the lid on the pan and let the whole boil up. Grate 
a cocoanut and peel and chop a very sour apple, or, instead of the apple, a few 
tamarinds would be best if they could be obtained; put them into the stewpan with 
the other ingredients, and boil the whole slowly until the cocoanut is tender. Mix 
two tablespoonfuls of flour smooth with a little water, and stir it into the above 
mixture; season to taste with salt, stir and boil for five minutes. Put two or three 
tomatoes, freed from their seeds, into a stewpan with a hundred oysters and their 
liquor, also the milk of the cocoanut. Stir them occasionally, and stew slowly for a 
few minutes. Add this to the former mixture. Squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, 
turn the curry on to a hot dish, garnish with croutons of fried bread, or sippets of 
toast, and serve with a separate dish of rice. 

Oyster Fricassee. 

Open and beard some oysters, put them into a stewpan with their own liquor, 
one ounce of butter and the strained juice of half a lemon; season them with a small 
quantity each of cayenne pepper and grated nutmeg and let them simmer gently by 
the side of the fire for a few minutes. Do not cook them too much or they will 
shrivel up. Beat the yolks of three eggs together with three tablespoonfuls of sherry, 
strain and pour in with the oysters. Toss the whole over the fire for a minute, then 
turn them on to a dish and serve.

Fried Oysters. 

Select large oysters and drain them; mix one tablespoonful of flour smoothly 
with one-half teacupful of milk, grate some stale breadcrumbs on a sheet of paper 
and season with salt and pepper; roll the oysters first in the paste and then in the 
breadcrumbs, covering well but touching them as little as possible. Lay them on a 
plate and leave them for several minutes. Beat one or two eggs thoroughly, roll the 
oysters in it one at a time, then roll them again in the seasoned breadcrumbs. Put 
a large lump of lard in a frying pan over the fire and when blue smoke arises put in 
the oysters and fry them until nicely browned. Take each oyster as it is cooked out 
of the fat and lay it on a sheet of paper in front of the fire to drain. Spread a folded 
napkin or an ornamental dish-paper over a hot dish, pile the oysters upon it, garnish 
with fried parsley and serve. 

Fried Oysters and Bacon. 

Open and remove the beards from one dozen oysters, cut as many thin slices of 
bacon as there are oysters, trim neatly and lay an oyster on each, rolling them up and 
fasten with a skewer. Fry each roll carefully and nicely. Cut as many rounds of 
bread about a third of an inch thick and two inches in diameter as there are rolls of 
bacon, toast them evenly on both sides and butter them. Spread a folded napkin or 
fancy edged dish-paper on a hot dish, place the pieces of toast upon it with a roll on 
each, garnish with fried parsley and serve. 

Fried Deviled Oysters. 

Take one pint of oysters or sufficient to make a good dish, wipe them dry and 
lay them on a flat dish ; cover with butter well-warmed and mixed with cayenne 
pepper and lemon juice, turn them over and over in this mixture for ten minutes, then 
roll them in a paper of rolled crackers or sifted breadcrumbs ; dip them into beaten 
egg and again roll them in the crumbs, fry them in boiling lard and butter mixed and 
serve as hot as possible. 

Fried Oyster Patties. 

Make some good puff paste, roll it out rather thin and cut it into round pieces. 
Chop some oysters, mix them with some chopped hard boiled egg, a little chopped 
parsley and a little grated lemon peel ; add a seasoning of pepper, salt and a little 
pounded mace, moisten the mixture with cream and a little oyster liquor, then put a 
good spoonful on each piece of paste, fold it over, moisten the edges with a little 
cream and press them together. Brush the patties over with the yolk of an egg and 
fry them for fifteen minutes. 



SHELL-FISH. 

Fried Truffled Oysters. 

Chop six ounces of the cooked breast of a fowl and three ounces of raw fat salt 
pork, put this into a mortar with a little pepper and pound it. Chop a few truffles 
the size of peas and mix in. Put four dozen oysters on a cloth and with a sharp knife 
inserted at the edge of one of them make an opening up and down inside, but not to 
make the hole too large and fill them with the mixture. Put them when all done into 
a basin of flour, coat them well over, dip them into well-beaten egg, plunge them into 
a fryingpan of boiling fat and fry to a light golden color. Remove, drain on a cloth 
in a slow oven, sprinkle over with salt, arrange them on pieces of toast on a dish and 
serve. 

Oyster Fritters. 

Separate the yolk and white of an egg, beating the yolk well and mixing with it 
two tablespoonfuls each of ground rice and salad oil, three-fourths of a tablespoonful 
of vinegar, and a small quantity of cold water. Mix smoothly and allow the batter 
to stand for half an hour. Open and beard the oysters, whisk the whites of the eggs 
to a stiff snow, and mix them in lightly with the batter. Then place a large lump 
of clarified fat in a flat stewpan over a fire until it boils. Take the oysters, one at 
a time, in a tablespoon and fill it with the batter, pouring it into the boiling fat. 
Fry until nicely browned, then drain well, spreading on a folded napkin or orna- 
mental dish-paper over a hot dish, pile the fritters in the center, garnish with cut 
lemons, and serve with a plate of thin slices of brown bread and butter. 

Oysters in Cases. 

Open and blanch a couple of dozen medium-sized oysters in a saucepan with one 
wineglassful of white wine and half an ounce of butter, and season with a pinch of 
pepper and a little nutmeg. Cook for five minutes, and add one pint of well reduced 
veloute sauce ; cooking for another five minutes, and adding half an ounce of cray- 
fish butter and stirring occasionally. Fill the cases with four oysters each and the 
garnishing equally divided. Sprinkle over a little fresh breadcrumbs, and arrange 
them on a toasting pan. Spread a little butter over each patty, and place in a mod- 
erate oven for five minutes. Have a hot dish at hand with a folded napkin spread 
over it ; place the patties on it and serve. 



Oysters, Indian Style. 



Put one-half tablespoonful each of curry powder and flour in a small saucepan ; 
mix in gradually a teacupful of cream, one tablespoonful of finely chopped onion and 
a small quantity of finely chopped apple, season to taste with salt and pepper, and 
stew the whole gently for twenty minutes, stirring occasionally. Put a teacupful of 
well washed rice in a saucepan of water and boil until tender. The rice should be 



u 4 SHELL-FISH. 

quite dry when cooked. Put a dozen oysters in the sauce, add a little lemon juice, 
and leave until hot. Make a wall of the rice on a hot dish, and pour the oysters in 
the center. Serve while very hot. 

Oysters in the Shell. 

Put a dozen or so of large oysters on a gridiron over a moderate fire with the 
flat shell uppermost ; when done they will open. Preserve the liquor in the shells 
with the oysters and serve them hot. 

Oyster Patties. 

Turn a couple of dozen oysters into a basin with their liquor. Put one ounce 
of butter into a saucepan and work it together with a tablespoonful of flour into a 
smooth paste ; when warm add a little mace, cayenne, and salt, and pour in gradually 
three tablespoonfuls of cream. Boil for a few minutes and pour in the strained 
liquor from the oysters, add the oysters last, and boil for a couple of minutes 
longer. Line some small patty pans with some thin puff paste, put a quantity of 
rice in each to keep them in shape, cover the top with more of the paste and 
bake in a brisk oven. Take them out, remove the top, empty out the rice, fill them 
with the oysters and a little of the liquor, cover and serve. 

Oyster Pie. 

Line a pie dish with puff paste, and fill it with slices of stale bread ; butter the 
paste that covers the edge of the dish, lay a cover of puff paste over the pie, press 
the edges very lightly together, trim them, and bake quickly in a hot oven. Mean- 
while drain the liquor from one quart of oysters and chop them fine with a sharp, thin 
bladed knife. Blend a teaspoonful of corn starch in a very little cold milk, pour over 
it one-half pint of boiling milk or cream, put it over the fire in a saucepan, stir till it 
thickens, and then add one ounce of butter ; when the butter has been well mixed 
in, season the chopped oysters with salt and pepper, stir them into the thickened 
milk, let simmer (stirring all the time), for five minutes, and then take from off the fire. 
When the bread pie is baked remove from the oven, and while still hot carefully take 
off the upper crust ; remove the bread, and fill the dish with the thickened cream or 
milk and chopped oysters, replace the top crust, put the pie again in the oven till it 
is thoroughly hot and then serve. 

Oyster Poulette. 

Place thirty-six freshly-opened oysters in a saucepan with a little of their own 
liquor, one ounce of butter, half a pinch of salt and pepper and parboil for three min- 
utes, adding half a pint of hollandaise sauce; stew well together for two minutes 
longer, but without letting the liquor boil, add one teaspoonful of chopped parsley 
and the juice of half a lemon, stir slightly and serve very hot. 



SHELL-FISH. 115 



Scalloped Oysters. 



Strain the oyster liquor, rinse the oysters in it, then plump and beard them. 
Measure the liquor and add to it an equal quantity of rich white sauce; if this does 
not thicken it sufficiently add one teaspoonful of flour, rubbed into a small piece of 
butter, stir over the fire until pretty hot, stir until it boils and boil ten minutes, stir- 
ring occasionally. Put in the oysters and keep them nearly simmering for three min- 
utes, then put them into their shells with a little of the sauce, put a layer of sifted 
breadcrumbs on them, pour over this a little clarified butter and brown them in the 
oven. 



Spiced Oysters. 



Take a hundred fresh oysters, put them into a large earthenware pipkin together 
with their own liquor strained, half a nutmeg grated, eighteen cloves, four blades of 
mace, a teaspoonful of allspice, a very little cayenne pepper, one teaspoonful of salt 
and two tablespoonfuls of strong vinegar, and stir all these together with a wooden 
spoon. Put them in a moderately-heated oven or over a slow fire; take them from 
the fire several times and stir them thoroughly; as soon as they come to a boil pour 
them in a pan and let them stand all night in a cool place. They will be ready for 
eating next day. 

Steamed Oysters. 

Open and drain the required quantity of oysters, lay them in a steamer, which 
place over a saucepan of boiling water, cover them with a plate and cook for ten min- 
utes. When ready place the oysters in a very hot dish, garnish with some croutons 
of brown bread fried in butter and drained and a few drops of lemon or vinegar 
poured over them. Dust lightly with salt and pepper and serve. 



Stewed Oysters. 



Open the shells of one dozen oysters, take them out carefully and wash them in 
their own liquor until perfectly free from grit and pieces of shell, put them in a sauce- 
pan, strain the liquor twice, pour it over, place the pan at the side of the fire and let it 
simmer gently for a few minutes until done. Remove the oysters with a skimmer and 
put them on a dish in a slow oven to keep warm; add to the liquor one teacupful of 
cream and salt and cayenne to taste. Place the pan on the fire and when the liquor 
boils add two ounces of butter worked up with one teaspoonful of flour and continue 
to stir till it is all thoroughly mixed. Put in the oysters to warm up without boiling, 
remove the pan from the fire and stir in a little lemon juice. Have ready some pieces 
of bread fried in butter, arrange them on a dish, put the oysters on them, pour over 
the liquor and serve very hot.

Stewed Oysters, Baltimore Style. 

Open neatly three dozen medium sized fresh oysters, place them in a saucepan 
without their liquor, and add one ounce of good butter; cover the pan, place it over 
the fire and cook for two minutes, then add one wineglassful of good Madeira wine and 
a very little cayenne pepper, cook together for two minutes longer and add one gill 
each of Spanish sauce and half-glaze. Stir thoroughly until boiling, and just before 
serving squeeze in the juice of a lemon, add one-half ounce of butter, a teaspoonful of 
finely chopped parsley, and serve immediately in a hot tureen. 

Stuffed Oysters. 

Put the grated yolks of four hard boiled eggs into a basin and mix in half the 
quantity of minced bacon or salt fat pork, add a little pepper or chopped parsley and 
make them all into a paste by adding the uncooked yolk of another egg. Split open 
four dozen oysters, stuff them with this mixture, put them in large oyster shells, coat 
them over with breadcrumbs, put a little warmed butter on top, place them in an 
oven and bake until done. Put them on a dish, garnish with pieces of fried bread 
and serve. 

Oyster Vol-au-Vent. 

Put the liquor and beards of three dozen oysters into a saucepan, add a little 
pepper (cayenne) and the finely chopped rind and strained juice of half a lemon. Put 
the pan on the fire, boil up the liquor and thicken with three ounces of butter rubbed 
into two tablespoonfuls of flour. Continue to boil till the liquor is reduced to one 
teacupful, strain it into another saucepan, add the oysters, place the pan at the side 
of the fire and simmer gently for five or six minutes, then stir in one teacupful of 
cream and keep the mixture warm. Prepare a paste as follows: Rub twelve ounces 
of butter into an equal quantity of flour and mix in the juice of a lemon added to one 
egg beaten up in one teacupful of cold water. Make this into a paste, handling it as 
little as possible, turn it out on a well-floured board and roll it out to one and one- 
fourth inches in thickness. Cut it with a vol-au-vent tin cutter to take off the rough 
edges, make it the required shape, cut round the top one-half inch from the edge and 
one-fourth inch deep and bake the vol-au-vent in a hot oven for forty-five minutes. 
When done carefully take out the center, remove the soft underdone paste and fill it 
up with the oyster mixture. Arrange the vol-au-vent on a napkin spread over a dish 
and serve with a garnish of fried parsley. 

Oysters with Cream. 

Put a pint of cream in a saucepan with a small piece of onion and a little mace 
tied up in a muslin bag. Boil and stir in a tablespoonful of flour mixed with a little 
milk or cream. Put one quart of oysters in a saucepan with their liquor and boil

them for a few minutes until tender, skimming frequently. Remove the oysters, 
drain, put them in the saucepan with the cream, remove the onion and mace, pour it 
into a dish and serve hot. 

Oysters with Parmesan Cheese. 

Drain the oysters as free as possible from liquor ; spread a dish thickly with 
butter, lay the oysters on it, strew finely-minced parsley over them, season with 
pepper, pour one-half glass of champagne over and cover thickly with grated Par- 
mesan cheese. Put the dish into the oven, and when nicely browned .on top, drain 
the fat carefully off the oysters, and serve, while very hot, in the same dish. 

Boiled Prawns. 

Place a pint of prawns, previously thoroughly washed, into a saucepan with 
enough water to cover them, adding salt in the proportion of one-quarter pound 
to each gallon of water ; set the pan on a quick fire, and boil for eight minutes, 
skimming frequently ; then remove, drain on a sieve, and serve artistically arranged, 
interspersed with parsley. 

Buttered Prawns. 

Remove from their shells three breakfast cupfuls of prawns, and dredge over 
them salt and pepper to taste, place them in a saucepan and pour over them two 
breakfast cupfuls of good rich gravy, and add a small lump of butter, well-kneaded 
with flour, to thicken it. Then place the pan at the side of the fire, and simmer 
gently for five to six minutes, after which, turn the prawns out on to a dish and serve. 

Baked Scallops. 

Take the scallops out of their shells and trim off the beards and all the black 
parts. Wash the deep shells of the scallops, dry them, put in the scallops, and pour 
one-half tablespoonful of vinegar over each. Blanch a bunch of parsley and chop it 
finely ; mix it with the grated breadcrumbs, season to taste with pepper and salt, 
and bind the mixture into a paste with a little milk. Spread some of the paste over 
each shell, strew a few dried breadcrumbs on the top, and put a small piece of 
butter on each. Place them in a brisk oven and bake for twenty minutes. Serve the 
scallops very hot and in their shells, on a folded napkin on a dish. 

Fried Scallops. 

Trim off the beards and black parts, clean the scallops well and drain them. Put 
a lump of lard into a flat stewpan, place it over the fire until blue smoke rises, then 
put in the scallops and fry them until lightly browned. Drain them for a moment on

a sheet of paper, arrange them on a hot dish over which has been spread a folded 
napkin garnished with fried parsley, and serve. 



Stewed Scallops. 



Put some scallops in a stewpan with a half blade of mace, a little sugar and suf- 
ficient water to cover them ; stew gently by the edge of the fire for about thirty min- 
utes or until tender. Put one and one-half ounces of butter in a stewpan with one 
tablespoonful of flour and mix it over the fire, then stir in some of the liquor in which 
the scallops were stewed, three tablespoonfuls of cream and flavor with a little grated 
nutmeg. Arrange the scallops on a hot dish, pour the sauce over them and serve. 



Shrimps and Boiled Rice. 



Make thick white sauce of one heaping tablespoonful of flour, one ounce of 
butter and one-half pint of milk ; flavor it sparingly with mace, cayenne and salt. 
Stir into the sauce one pint of shelled shrimps ; when they are thoroughly hot, pour 
them on to a hot dish, arrange around them a border of boiled rice and serve. 



Buttered Shrimps. 



Shell some shrimps and place them in a fryingpan with a lump of butter, a small 
quantity of salt and pepper, and stir them over the fire until hot. Fry some thin 
slices of bread in butter, drain when a golden brown and place them on a hot dish; 
pile the buttered shrimps on the bread and serve. 



Shrimp Cromeskies. 



Shell some shrimps and cut them into small pieces. Prepare some veloute sauce 
and reduce it to half its original quantity; move the sauce to the side of the fire, stir 
in the beaten yolks of two eggs and one tablespoonful of butter divided into small 
pieces, continue stirring the sauce by the side of the fire, adding, when thick, the 
shrimps. Leave the mixture until cold, then divide it into equal parts and wrap each 
one separately in squares of udder; roll the cromeskies to the shape of a cork, dip 
them in frying batter, then plunge them into boiling fat and fry until crisp and nicely 
browned. When cooked drain the cromeskies, put them on a folded napkin or orna- 
mental dish-paper on a hot dish, garnish with fried parsley and serve. 



Shrimps, Normandy Style. 



Skin and remove the heads from one pint of fresh shrimps; put one ounce of 
butter in a stewpan, place it over the fire until melted, then stir in one tablespoonful 
of ground rice; mix in one-half pint of new milk, and continue stirring until it is 



SHELL-FISH. 119 

thickened and boiling. Then put in the shrimps and leave them until quite hot. 
When ready turn them on to a hot dish, garnish with sippets of toast or croutons of 
fried bread and serve. 



Shrimp Patties or Bouchees. 



Remove the shells from three or four pints of fresh shrimps; bone and chop 
finely three anchovies, mix them with the shrimps, and season to taste with pounded 
mace and cloves. Moisten the mixture with about one and one-half wineglassfuls of 
white wine. Prepare some puff paste, roll it to about one-half inch in thickness, cut 
the paste into rounds with a two-inch tin cutter, then with a one-inch cutter cut half 
way through the middle of each round of paste. Brush the rounds over with a paste- 
brush dipped in the beaten yolk of an egg, and bake them in a quick oven. Heat the 
shrimp mixture in a saucepan over the fire, and when the patties are cooked lift off 
the piece marked with the cutter, scoop out the soft inside, fill them with the mixture, 
cover with the small rounds of paste, arrange them on a hot dish over which has been 
spread a folded napkin, garnished with fried parsley, and serve. 

Scalloped Shrimps. 

Prepare one-half pint of tomato sauce, and put in with it one-half pint of picked 
shrimps, and one wineglassful of either red or white wine. Stir the above ingredients 
in a saucepan over the fire until hot, then turn them into a scallop dish; cover the 
top with finely grated breadcrumbs, put three or four lumps of butter over, and bake 
until browned. When well colored, take the dish out of the oven and serve the 
shrimps while hot. 

Stewed Shrimps. 

Pick one quart of shrimps, reserve their tails, and place the remainder in a stew- 
pan with one-half pint of water, and pour in a little vinegar; also put one-half blade 
of mace; let them simmer at the side of the fire for fifteen minutes, stirring occasion- 
ally. Strain the liquor into another saucepan, add the tails, half of a grated nutmeg, 
a small quantity of salt, and two ounces of butter that has been worked with two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir them over the fire for about fifteen minutes. Toast 
a thin slice of bread, cut it into strips, place them at the bottom of a hot dish, pour 
the stew over them, garnish with parsley, and serve. 

The Diamond-Back or Salt-Water Terrapin. 

Three species of the genus Malacoclemmys inhabit the United States. By far 
the most important of these, and the most valuable of all terrapins is the Malacoclem- 
mys Palustris, or the "diamond-back terrapin." 

The other two species, the Geographic Tortoises, M. Geographica and M. 



120 SHELL-FISH. 

Lesueuri are of a comparatively rare occurrence and are not used for food to any 
considerable extent. 

DISTRIBUTION. The "diamond-back," or "salt-water terrapin" is common along 
our entire Atlantic coast, from Nantucket and New Bedford, in Massachusetts, to 
Texas. It also occurs in South America. It was introduced into Italy by the Prince 
of Canino a number of years ago, but of the success of the enterprise I have been un- 
able to learn. Those who enter into commerce however are principally from the 
Chesapeake Bay and the coast of the Carolinas. Some very fine ones also come from 
Egg Harbor, N. J. 

CHARACTERISTICS AND HABITS. The diamond-back lives in salt marshes near 
the coast, and is seldom found far from them. They were formerly very abundant in 
such localities, and could be often seen on warm days sunning themselves on the bars 
and flats. But the increasing demand for them and the wholesale capture of old and 
young have reduced their numbers very materially. The species is a comparatively 
small one, and varies much in external appearance. The females attain a larger size 
than the male and are much more highly prized in the market. The average length 
of the under part of the shell is seven inches, and the weight of the animal four or 
five pounds. Rarely the length reaches ten inches, and the terrapin weighs about ten 
pounds. The fixed standard of length for salable females in most markets is six 
inches, but in some it is as low as five inches. The terrapin having that length are 
known as "counts." The small specimens are separated into "heifers" and "little 
bulls ;" their under shell rarely exceeds five inches in length. As has been already 
said, they are deemed very inferior to the females, and the price of them is therefore 
much lower. 

In regard to the rate of growth, I have seen it stated that the diamond-back 
reaches maturity, or rather lays eggs when four years old, but this is hardly probable. 
It does not accord with the observations of Agassiz and others nor with the peculiari- 
ties of the group generally. Experiments made by a dealer in North Carolina seem 
to show that the species grow about one inch each year, so that "counts" are at least 
six years old. Probably ten years at least elapse before they are fully grown. 

FOOD. What the food of the diamond-back terrapin is does not seem to be exactly 
known. Very probably, however, it consists of such matter, both animal and vegeta- 
ble, as the animal is able to find in the marshes in which it lives. When penned, 
preparatory to sending them to market, they are fed on crabs, oysters and fish. To 
give them the finest flavor, they are said to be fed upon celery for some days previous 
to being served. In the winter the tortoise hibernates and takes no food, remaining 
buried several inches in the mud. Unfortunately for its welfare, a little mound of mud 
is always raised above the spot where it disappears, which at once catches the eye of 
the terrapin fisherman. A large proportion of the terrapins are taken while they are 
in this torpid condition. 

BREEDING HABITS Like all other species of tortoises, the diamond-back deposits 
its eggs on land. When the laying season arrives, the female seeks some sandy bar or 



SHELL-FISH. 121 

bank above water, and having excavated a shallow pit with the hind legs, deposits 
from five to seven eggs. The breeding season occurs in the latter part of June and 
early part of July. It is said that the young show no disposition to seek the water, 
but prefer to remain in the sand. 

ECONOMIC VALUE. The diamond-back is highly prized for food. Philadelphia 
furnished the best market for this species, but it is also sold in large numbers in Balti- 
more, Washington, New York, Boston, Chicago, Pittsburg, Cincinnati, St. Louis and 
many other cities. The season lasts from the beginning of October to the first or 
middle of June ; the best months are October and November. The specimens from North 
Carolina usually appear in the market last. The "counts" or those over six inches 
long bring from eighteen to thirty-six dollars per dozen in the market ; the smaller 
o/nes are usually sold separately at prices of from fifteen to fifty cents apiece. These 
prices, however, are almost sixty per cent higher than the prices received by the 
catcher, for the terrapins pass through several hands on their way to the market. The 
majority of terrapins are actually caught in the summer months and are penned in yards, 
known as "crawls" until the marketing season arrives, 

To kill the terrapin it is necessary to have ready a large saucepan of boiling 
water, one that will hold a terrapin easily, and to plunge the creature into it head 
first, putting the lid or cover on the pan immediately, and leaving it in the water for 
ten or fifteen minutes. Then remove it and peel off the black skin from the shell, 
and the nails from the claws. Wash the terrapin thoroughly in warm water, and 
remove the under shell by chipping through the thinnest parts, where the black shell 
joins. Cut close to the shell so as not to lose any meat, pour away the water, but 
keep the blood, which will be found in the deep or black shell. Take out the dark green 
gall bladder, which is about the size of a cherry, and will be found near the center at the 
side of the liver, and also the sand bag and entrail, and preserve the eggs, if there be any. 
Loosen the meat from the top shell, cutting through the spine bone, just above the tail, 
where it is attached to the shell, turn the terrapin into a flat pan, and cut off the head. 
This, with the shell, can be used for soup. Separate the two fore and two hind legs, so 
as to have four pieces, trim off the claws, and scrape off the thin outside covering. In 
the female terrapin there will be found rich fat at the shoulders. This should be 
taken off, as it does not require so much cooking as the other parts, and should only 
be added when they are nearly done. It is of a dark green color. All the pieces of 
meat, together with the fat and legs, should be kept in water until wanted for use. 
Only the flesh, eggs and liver of the terrapin are ordinarily used, but sometimes the 
intestines are scalded and scraped, and added to the terrapin. When there are no 
eggs in the terrapin, egg balls are made to accompany it. 

Baked Terrapin. 

Cut off the head of a terrapin, put it in a saucepan or pot with the shell on, and 
let it boil until the under shell can be removed easily. Take it out, pull out all the

meat, cleaning the upper shell thoroughly ; pick the meat to pieces, and mix it up 
with a few crackers and chopped onions, a small quantity each of allspice, black 
pepper, chopped parsley and butter, and pour over a small quantity of wine. Put 
this mixture into the top shell, place a few slices of lemon on the top, set it in the 
oven and bake. When done take it out and serve.

them with the top shell downward in the sand and bake in the oven for an hour. 
Take them out, remove the under shell, gall bag and entrails and loosen the meat 
without taking it out of the back shell. Pull off the legs, skin them and lay them on 
the top. Put one breakfast cupful of butter in a basin to soften, mix in one teacup- 
ful of flour, one teaspoonful each of salt and black pepper and the juice of a lemon.

add a few hard boiled eggs cut up and sufficient white wine to moisten. Boil until 
the meat is quite tender, turn the whole out on to a dish and serve. The meat for 
this should be rather over than underdone. The wine and lemon may be substituted 
by rich stock or by turtle soup, 



Side Dishes. 

Anchovy Tartines. 



Unroll, dry and cut into narrow strips the contents of a bottle of anchovies pre- 
served in oil. Cut some French rolls into round slices, butter them well and arrange 
a few of the strips of anchovy on them so as to form an open or trellis work. In the

from each other, and brush them over with beaten egg ; make a mark on the surface 
of each with a paste cutter two inches in diameter, being careful to dip the cutter 
each time in hot water, so that the marked line may remain perfect ; then place in 
a brisk oven for twenty minutes ; lift the centers with a knife, remove the crumb and 
fill with a white salpicon, made of truffles, mushrooms and finely shredded chicken 
and tongue cut up into small dice. Set the centers on again as covers, and serve on 
a hot dish with a folded napkin on it.

of cheese, and add salt, pepper and chili vinegar until the mixture has the taste 
and appearance of dressed crab. Mix in a few chopped oysters ; put the mixture 
into small cases of bread fried in butter, and garnish with hard boiled yolk of egg 
rubbed through a sieve and mixed with finely-chopped parsley. Arrange these 
bouchees on a napkin on. a dish, and serve. 

Canapes.

SIDE DISHES. 127 

Serve while hot. A fillet of anchovy shredded into two laid lengthwise on these 
canapes are an improvement, and they may be eaten cold with salad. They may also 
be garnished with finely chopped parsley. 

Canapes of Crab 

Take six slices of bread, cut off the crusts, and fry the slices to a light brown 
with a pat of butter. Take the lower shell from a few crabs, and pick out the meat 
from the body and claws; place the meat on a plate, season with salt and pepper, and 
mince up well. Put one ounce of butter in a saucepan with a chopped onion, cook 
for a few minutes, but do not let the onion brown. Stir in two tablespoonfuls of

each a layer of Russian caviar and squeeze over a little lemon juice. Boil some eggs 
till hard and when cold peel and cut into slices; lay a slice of egg on each slice of 
roll and press them slightly together. Put the canapes on a dish with a folded nap- 
kin or a dish-paper, garnish them with green parsley and serve. A very small quan- 
tity of finely minced parsley strewn over the tops of the eggs will be found an im- 
provement. 

Canapes of Lobster. 

Spread with lobster butter a few thin slices of bread fried in butter; leave for 
two hours some slices of lobster in a marinade of oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Take

128 SIDE DISHES. 

Canapes Lorenzo. 

Cut six slices of bread the width of an American loaf and one-quarter of an 
inch in thickness, neatly pare off the crust and fry in a sautoire, together with half 
an ounce of fresh butter, so as to make them a light brown color ; then boil eighteen 
hard-shell crabs in salted water for about twelve minutes, after which remove and 
allow them to become cool, when the upper shell should be removed, and with the 
aid of a pointed knife pick out all of the meat, cracking the claws and removing all 
the meat from there also ; place it all on a plate, season with a teaspoonful of salt 
and half a saltspoonful of red pepper ; then place one ounce of butter in a saucepan, 
with a peeled and very finely chopped onion, and cook them together for about two 
minutes over a moderate fire ; add two tablespoonfuls of flour, stir again for two 
minutes, and add one gill of broth, and stir while slowly cooking for five minutes, 
now add the crab meat, and cook for quarter of an hour, stirring once in a while with 
a wooden spoon, then remove into another vessel and let it cool for fifteen minutes. 
Put in a sautoire a tablespoonful of good butter over a stove, and mix in with one 
tablespoonful of flour, and cook for three minutes gently ; add a couple of ounces of 
grated Parmesan cheese and an equal quantity of Swiss cheese, stirring well together; 
place it in a vessel to cool. Put a layer of crab meat on each slice of toast a quarter 
of an inch thick, and divide the prepared cheese in six equal portions, forming them 
into ball shapes about two inches in diameter, and arrange them over the layer of 
crab meat in the center, place them on a dish and bake in a brisk oven for about five 
minutes, then take them out and serve them in the same dish in which they have 
been cooked. 

Canapes Madison. 

Cut six thin slices of bread and trim them all alike, toast to a golden color, and 
place them on a dish. Cover each slice with a very thin slice of lean cooked ham ; 
spread a little mustard over it, then cover with a layer of provincial garnishing.

all. Place them in a hot oven, and bake for ten minutes ; then take them out, 
arrange on a hot dish, covered by a folded napkin, and serve. 

Olive and Anchovy Canapes. 

Stone and peel some olives, being sure to keep their shape as much as possible ; 
wash an equal number of anchovies and coil an anchovy around each olive. Cut as 
many rounds of bread as there are olives and toast them lightly on both sides ; butter 
them while they are hot and put an olive on each. Spread a dish paper over a hot 
dish, arrange the toast on it, garnish with a border of fresh well-washed water- 
cresses, and serve. This dish is much used for luncheons, 



SIDE DISHES. 129 

Olive and Caper Canapes. 

Cut six slices of bread out of which cut twelve rounds. Melt some butter in a 
stewpan, then put in the slices of bread and fry them. When they are nicely browned 
take them out of the fat and place them on a piece of paper to drain. Skin and bone 
twelve anchovies, put them in a mortar, mash, then rub them through a fine wire 
sieve. Spread the anchovy paste over the pieces of bread, strew finely chopped 
capers and olives on the top, place them on a baking-dish and put in a brisk oven for 
ten minutes. Arrange the toast on a fancy napkin and serve it while it is very hot. 

Oyster Canapes. 

Finely chop a dozen oysters, put them in a saucepan with a teaspoonful of 
cracker dust or finely grated breadcrumb, a lump of butter about the size of a walnut, 
and one-half teacupful of thick cream, and season with salt and pepper. Stir the 
mixture over the fire and let it simmer for a few minutes. Cut some slices of bread 
about one-fourth inch in thickness, butter them, and put them on a hot dish. Pour 
the mixture over the bread and butter and serve it while hot. 



Canapes of Sardines. 



Bone six or eight sardines, put half of them in a mortar with the hard-boiled 
yolks of three eggs and pound them, mixing in by degrees sufficient butter to make 
a firm paste. Season the mixture with a small quantity of finely-chopped parsley, 
chives and tarragon, mustard, pepper and a small quantity of vinegar. Rub all the 
ingredients together until quite smooth. Cut slices of bread into oval-shaped pieces, 
and fry them in butter until well browned, but not too dark a color. When fried 
drain and spread over with the sardine mixture. Arrange the slices on a dish over 
which has been spread an ornamental dish-paper or a folded napkin. Cut a few more 
sardines into small fillets, lay them on the canapes with very small slices of pickled 
gherkins and a few shelled prawns. This is a very pretty dish and simple in con- 
struction. 

Canapes -of Smoked Salmon. 

Fry in clarified butter some fingers of bread, two and one-half inches long, one 
and one-half inches wide and one-fourth inch thick; when lightly browned drain them 
and leave them until cold. Mask the pieces of bread with anchovy butter, place some 
thin slices of smoked salmon on each, sprinkle over some chopped hard-boiled egg 
and parsley and serve. 

Tricolor Canapes. 

Skin and bone six anchovies, pound them in a mortar and pass them through a 
fine wire sieve. Boil three eggs until they are hard, separate the whites from the 



130 SIDE DISHES. 

yolks and pass them separately through the sieve. Care must be taken in preparing 
these ingredients not to get the colors mixed. Cut four slices of bread, trim off the 
crusts, and cut each slice into two square pieces. Put a strip of the hard-boiled white 
of an egg on a piece of fried bread, next a strip of finely-chopped gherkins or capers, 
and next a strip of the yolk of eggs, thus making three colors on one piece of bread. 
Proceed in like manner with the rest. Spread a fancy dish-paper or a folded napkin 
over a dish, arrange the canapes neatly on it, placing here and there a few sprigs of 
parsley and serve. 

Caviar on Toast. 

Prepare six rounds of toast of white bread. Place in a saucepan two large table- 
spoonfuls of caviar and one tablespoonful of cream, heat for a minute or two at one 
side of the fire, stirring carefully meanwhile. Pour this mixture over the toast and 
serve on a dish with a folded napkin. 

Caviar with Eggs. 

Cut off from stale French rolls some slices about a third of an inch thick; spread 
on them anchovy butter or fry them lightly in butter. Spread over each slice a 
thick layer of caviar, then squeeze over a little lemon juice and add a seasoning of 
salt and pepper. Have prepared some hard boiled eggs, peel them and cut them 
into slices, using a very sharp knife; lay the slices of egg, one on each side of the 
bread, and serve on a dish on which has been laid an ornamental paper. A bit of 
chopped mustard and cress salad spread over the caviar is an improvement. 



Curling Celery. 



Slit the stalks with a penknife closely should the fringe be too fine, taking care 
that the slits all end at an even line. If a large amount of celery is used every day 
set on the tables in celery glasses, a sort of rake is used in place of the penknife, and 
this rake is made by driving a number of the three-edged sacking needles of the very 
smallest size through a soft piece of cigar boxwood. The celery ends are combed 
with this and then put in glasses of ice-water to cool at leisure. 



Frizzled Celery. 



Take one large head of good celery, pare off the green stalks and cut off the 
root, which may be used for salad. Cut the stalk lengthwise into four equal parts, 
wash them well in cold water and cut each one into pieces about three inches long, 
and by doing this all the branches will be separated. With the aid of a small sharp 
knife pare the thin sides a little, making five or six slits in each piece, starting from 
the top downward, leaving from one-half to three-quarters of an inch uncut, and put 
them in cold water with plenty of ice, allowing them to remain for about two hours. 
Then remove them from the ice water, arrange them tastefully on a round glass dish 



SIDE DISHES. 131 

and serve. Celery arranged and served in this way makes a beautiful effect on the 
table, though it requires time and patience to prepare it. 

Serving Celery in a Glass. 

Thoroughly wash two or three heads of fine white celery, pare off the green 
stalks and trim the roots, being careful to save the clear white hearts. Cut every 
head lengthwise into quarters, rinse them again in cold water, and let them remain in 
a dish of clean ice water until required. Arrange them in a celery stand, or glass or 
dress on a china dish, with a few pieces of ice in the center, and serve. 

Olive Custards. 



Stone some olives. Beat two eggs well, put them into a lined stewpan with two 
ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, and with a wooden spoon, stir over the fire 
until they are thick, then remove the pan. Cut as much bread as there are olives, 
fry them in boiling butter until they are of a light golden brown and drain ; spread 
them with a layer of the anchovy paste, then with a layer of the cheese mixture and 
put an olive on each. Spread an ornamented napkin on a dish, arrange the rounds 
on it and serve. 

Olives Stuffed with Anchovies. 

Stone a dozen Spanish olives ; wash and bone five anchovies, chop them finely, 
put them in a mortar with a moderate quantity each of chopped onion and parsley, 
pound them smoothly and season with a small quantity of cayenne pepper. Fill the 
hollows of the olives left by the stones with the pounded mixture, Cut a few slices 
of bread and scoop a hollow in the center of each round ; put a large piece of lard 
in a stewpan on the fire, and when it boils put in the rounds of bread and fry them 
until they are brown. Afterwards drain, then leave them until they are cool, and 
place an olive in the middle of each. Arrange them on a dish, pour over a small 
quantity of mayonnaise sauce and serve. 

Olives Stuffed with Chestnuts. 

Take twelve Spanish olives and six Spanish chestnuts, put two ounces of butter 
in a saucepan with two ounces of ham cut in small pieces, a small carrot and onion 
peeled and cut into thin slices and fry until they are brown; then add a bay-leaf, a 
blade of mace, four peppercorns, dredge in one tablespoonful of flour and moisten 
with some of the liquor from the olives. Stir the whole until they are mixed then 
place the pan over the fire and stir occasionally. Boil the chestnuts and when they 
are tender peel and put them in a mortar with one pound of butter, salt and pepper to 
taste, and a small quantity of grated nutmeg, pound until smooth. Peel the olives, 
remove the stones, fill the hollows with the chestnuts, and lay them in a lined stew- 
pan; strain the above sauce over them and let them simmer at the side of the fire 



132 SIDE DISHES. 

until they are hot through. Cut a thick slice of bread, fry it in butter until it is 
nicely browned, then drain and scoop out the center, making a hollow large enough to 
hold the olives. When it is ready put the olives on the bread, place it on a hot dish, 
garnish tastefully round with quarters of hard-boiled eggs, pour the sauce round the 
bread and serve while it is very hot. 

Dressed Raw Onions. 

Peel some onions, chop fine, put in water with a very little salt and let them soak 
for an hour or so. Remove them, drain, place on a dish and pour over a mixture of 
one-half gill of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls each of made mustard, chili vinegar and 
sugar, and one tablespoonful of salt. Put a lump of ice on top and garnish the dish 
with curled parsley. If the parsley is eaten after the onions it is supposed to take 
the smell away. , 

Patties. 

Take a few small patty pans and spread them with short paste, make a savory 
forcemeat of raw calf's liver, fill the pans with it, put over these covers of thin paste 
and place them in a slack oven to bake. Remove when done, and when they are cold 
cut off the covering of paste, take out a little of the inside and put in a little cooked 
goose's fat liver. Replace that which was removed and put it over the goose's liver, 
raising the preparation in a dome above the edges of the paste. Set a small jelly 
crouton on the top. Arrange the patties in a pyramid on a dish and garnish them 
with more aspic, according to taste. 

Beef Marrow Patties. 

Blanch one-fourth pound of sweet almonds and pound them in a mortar, adding 
occasionally a few drops of orange flower water. When quite smooth, mix with them 
two heaped tablespoonfuls of flour, the beaten yolks of three eggs, and sufficient 
warm water to make the whole into a smooth paste. Butter some small shallow 
moulds, line them with the paste, brush them over with paste brush dipped into well- 
beaten yolk of egg, and bake them in a slow oven. Chop and flavor some marrow 
with lemon peel, and mix some sweet cream with it. When the patties are cooked, 
take them out of their moulds, put a small piece of marrow mixture in each, spread 
them over with white of egg that has been whipped to a stiff froth, and dredge lightly 
with powdered sugar. Put them in the oven to set the egg, then place them on a dish 
that has been garnished with a folded napkin, or an ornamental dish-paper and serve 
very hot. 

Patties Dauphine. 

Roll out one and one-half pounds of brioche paste four times, then with a round 
tin cutter two inches in diameter, cut out of this twenty round flats; put in the center

of each one of half of the rounds, a small ball of croquette preparation, then put the 
other rounds on top and moisten and pinch the edges together; cut them again with 
the same tin cutter to make them round. Spread a floured cloth on a baking-sheet, 
arrange the patties on it a short distance from each other, cover with a floured cloth 
and keep them in a warm temperature for thirty-five minutes; then put them a few at 
a time into boiling fat and fry till nicely browned. When cooked, drain the patties 
on a cloth, pile them on a folded napkin on a dish, and serve. 

Dresden Patties. 

Take three ounces of any kind of cold boiled fish, trim off the skin and bone and 
chop the fish fine. Put one ounce of butter into a flat stewpan with a tablespoonful 
of flour, stir over the fire until mixed, then pour in a teacupful of milk, and continue 
stirring. Put the fish into the boiling milk, season to taste with salt and pepper, and 
cook over a slow fire for fifteen minutes. Cut two large rounds of bread about four 
inches in diameter and one and one-half inches in thickness and with a three-inch tin 
cutter cut half way through each. Dip the rounds well in cream, then drain, and dip 
them in well beaten egg. Season a small plate of finely grated breadcrumb with salt 
and pepper, and roll the rounds in them, giving a good coating. Put a large lump of 
clarified fat or lard into a fryingpan, place it over the fire till blue smoke rises, then 
put in the rounds and fry them till lightly browned. Take them out of the fat with a 
slice, and lay them on a sheet of kitchen paper to drain for a few minutes. Lift off 
the inner round of bread with a sharp knife, and scoop out from the center of the 
large round, all the soft bread. Fill the hollows with the fish mixture, and put the 
small rounds on top. Place the patties on a hot dish, over which has been spread a 
folded napkin or an ornamental dish-paper, garnish with a few neat sprigs of fried 
parsley, and serve while very hot. 

Patties Financiere. 

Butter twelve fluted deep patty pans, line them with short paste, then with 
paper, fill them with flour and bake in a moderate oven. When done remove the 
paper and flour, coat them inside with a thin layer of forcemeat, and set them at the 
entrance of the oven to keep warm. Roll out some puff paste and cut twelve rounds

Fontange Patties. 

Stir up with four ounces of flour the yolks of three or four eggs, a little salt, and 
a teacupful of olive oil ; mix with this one and one-half teacupfuls of beer and warm 
water mixed in equal quantities ; put a cloth over the basin, and keep it in a warm 
place for two hours, then pour the batter into a stewpan. Warm in boiling fat, an 
iron mould made for this purpose, of the shape of a little timbale ; when hot, dip it 
nearly, but not quite to the rim, in the batter, take it out again immediately, plunge 
it into the boiling fat and leave it till the batter is cooked ; then remove it from the 
mould and proceed as before until all the batter is cooked. Prepare a salpicon of 
poultry meat, pickled tongues, brains and mushrooms, thicken it with a little sauce, 
fill the batter shells with it, arrange them on a folded napkin on a dish, and serve. 

Lent Patties. 

Make fifteen small puff paste patties, as for Vol-au-Vent Patties, and bake 
them. When done take them off the baking-sheet, empty the pans, and keep the 
patties warm. Beat fifteen eggs and season them with salt and a little grated nutmeg. 
Peel and cut into small dice three small truffles, put them in a saucepan with a small 
lump of butter, and warm them. Pour the beaten eggs in with the truffles, add a 
little more butter broken in small pieces, and stir over a slow fire till thick. Mix a 
teacupful of bechamel sauce with the above ingredients, take it off the fire, fill the

rounds with a tin cutter about two and one-half inches in diameter, then take a 
smaller cutter, about one and one-half inches in diameter, and cut nearly, but 
not quite through, in the center of each one ; put them on a baking-dish and bake 
in a quick oven. The paste rises, and the inside becomes a lid that may be lifted 
out with the point of a knife. Trim off the surplus paste from the inside, fill them 
with whatever has been prepared for them, put the lids on and decorate with a sprig 
of parsley. 

Cheese Salad. 

Put the yolk of a hard-boiled egg into a basin, and rub it smooth with a table- 
spoonful of salad oil ; then add one teaspoonful of salt, one of cayenne and one of 
sugar, and made mustard, mixing each one separately, before another is added, and 
stirring in one-half pound of grated cheese. The cheese used for this purpose should

put it into a bowl and leave until cool. Cut some thin slices of stale bread, stamp 
them into rounds about the size of half a dollar silver piece, and fry them to a very 
light brown in boiling lard or oil. Lay them on paper to drain. Then put a thick 
layer of the cooled mixture of chopped ham and chicken between two fried rounds 
of bread, arrange them nicely on a dish, bake them in the oven for four or five min- 
utes and serve hot. Garnish with fried parsley. 

Adelaide Sandwiches.

between each; then cover them with a similar thickness of breadcrumbs, and roll 
each part into the shape of a cork, making them as near an equal size as possible. 



BEEF. 145 

Beat three whites of egg for a minute, so as to mix, but not froth them, and add a 
little pepper and salt, a tablespoonful of oil, and the same quantity of water. Dip 
the croquettes into this mixture, roll them in the breadcrumbs, and set on a plate.

with some red currant jelly. A wineglassful of claret and a little sugar may be added 
to the gravy, if desired; garnish with sippets of toasted bread. 

Bullock's Heart. 

In the opinion of most professional cooks the flesh of the heart is too coarse and 
greasy to be of any value to serve as a separate dish. This would appear to be some- 
what of an error of judgment, for prepared as follows ox-heart is not only tender but 
delicious eating. It should be served at all times on very hot plates hot-water 
plates, if possible, or dinner plates set upon soup plates containing hot water. The 
flesh of a cold bullock's heart is sometimes used either to increase the bulk of jugged 
hare or ae- a substitute for the hare itself. 

Roasted Bullock's Heart. 

Put a heart in a basin of warm water and let it soak for an hour to take out all 
the blood. Take it out, wipe dry with a cloth, stuff it with some highly seasoned 
forcemeat, tie round a piece of well-buttered paper, pass a spit through it and place it 
in front of a clear fire to roast, basting frequently with butter. When done (it will 
take about two hours), remove the paper, put it on a dish, pour over piquant sauce 
or a little rich gravy. 

Stewed Bullock's Heart. 

Put a bullock's heart in a basin of water, wash it well and let it soak to clean out 
the blood. Take it out, dry on a cloth, cut in halves, rub well over with flour, put 
them in a fryingpan with a little butter and fry to a brown color. Put them in a 
saucepan with a sprig of thyme, and four or five onions cut in slices and fried, sprinkle 
over a little salt and pepper and pour in sufficient water to cover. Place the pan on 
the fire and cook slowly for about three hours, then remove, skim the fat from the 
liquor, reduce it, thicken and add one wineglassful of claret and one teaspoonful of 
moist sugar. Place the heart again in the saucepan, heat it up, put it on a dish, pour 
over the gravy and serve.

Khulash. 

This dish is greatly esteemed in Germany, and is prepared as follows : 
Cut about two pounds of the head and fillet of beef into small squares. Cut up 
an onion into small pieces and fry it in a pan with a little butter, but not long enough 
to allow it to take color ; add the pieces of meat and fry them for ten or fifteen min- 
utes, add a little salt or cayenne and then remove the pan to the side of the fire and 
cover the lid with hot ashes. Let it remain for forty-five minutes when the moisture 
will all have evaporated, pour over a little gravy and continue to cook for an hour 
and a half. Dust over a little more cayenne, pour over two tablespoonfuls of 
brown sauce and cook for another ten minutes or so. Cut some potatoes in small 
dice or squares, blanch in cold water for a few minutes, roll them well in sauce, allow 
them to remain for a few minutes and serve. 

Beef Kidneys. 

The size of these and their somewhat coarse nature, places them quite outside the 
usual culinary preparations prescribed for the smaller kidneys, such as sheep's, lamb's, 
etc., nevertheless modern artistic cooks have found several effective modes of cook- 
ing them. 

Fried Beef Kidneys. 

Cut two kidneys in slices and soak in warm water for two and one-half hours, 
changing the water once or twice so as to cleanse them thoroughly; take the slices 
out, dust them over with flour, salt and pepper, put them in a fryingpan with three 
ounces of butter and fry to a light brown; place them in a circle on a dish, mix one 
tablespoonful of piquant sauce in one-half pint of gravy, add a teaspoonful of moist 
sugar, pour it in the center of the circle, and serve. As a rule beef kidneys are coarse, 
but cooked as above they are tender and luscious. 

Fried Beef Kidneys with Champagne. 

Select some kidneys that are of a good color, remove a little of the fat, mince 
them, mix with a little chopped parsley and shallots, and season with salt and pepper. 
Place this in a fryingpan over a moderate fire, and when done dust over with flour, 
add a wineglassful of champagne and two or three tablespoonfuls of bechamel sauce, 
and serve. 

Beef Kidney Rissoles. 

Cut a beef kidney into even slices and shape them into rounds, also the same 
quantity of bacon or ham cut into smaller rounds. Place the slices of bacon and ham 
over the kidney, then hard boiled eggs in slices over them, and fasten the slices 
together with a little warmed butter and the beaten yolk of an egg. Sprinkle over 



148 BEEF. 

with salt and pepper, cover them well with breadcrumbs, put them in a saucepan with 
a little butter, and fry for half an hour. Serve on a dish with brown gravy. 

Stewed Beef Kidneys. 

Stew some beef kidneys in a little salted water until done, then put them on a 
dish and sprinkle over salt and pepper, add a small quantity of flour to the liquor to 
thicken it and a little burnt sugar to color it, pour it over the kidneys and serve hot. 

Boiled Beef Liver and Rice. 

Soak one and one-half pounds of liver in cold water for half an hour to remove 
the blood, boil it slowly in three pints of water together with one-half pound of rice, 
add an onion, a sprig of parsley, and when the liver and rice are nearly cooked add 
pepper and salt to taste, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar and a slice of bacon cut in 
pieces. Remove the liver, cut it in slices and return them to the stew till all are suf- 
ficiently done. Serve hot. 

Macedoine of Beef. 

The desired quantity of rump steak is cut into slices half an inch in thickness 
and formed into the shape of cutlets, three inches by two inches, flat; trim all to the 
same size and lard thickly on one side with fine lardoons of bacon fat. Lay out, 
larded side uppermost, in a flat pan and nearly cover with richly flavored stock; cover 
the pan with a lid and braise in an oven for an hour. Remove the lid, baste the 
slices with gravy and let them remain uncovered in the oven until the larding has 
taken color; they are then ready to dish. Use equal amounts of sliced carrots, tur- 
nips, cutting into fancy shapes; green peas, string beans, asparagus tops and small 
sprigs of cauliflowers; boil all in salted water until quite tender. Melt in a saucepan 
a lump of butter, add a little flour and stir in enough milk to make a sauce, adding 
pepper, salt and a little grated nutmeg. Put into this sauce all the vegetables, of 
which there should be sufficient quantity to make them adhere together, and toss 
them gently in it until quite hot. Pile in the middle of a dish and place the slices 
around them in a circle. Skin off all fat from the gravy, pour it around the dish but 
not over the slices, and serve. 

Beef Marrow. 

The fatty contents of the long bones of the ox are esteemed a great delicacy. 
At one time it was considered quite the fashion to serve marrow-bones at table as a 
sort of luxurious supper dish; they were then dressed as follows: 

Marrow Bones. 

Take the bones from two legs of beef and saw them into pieces about four inches 
long. Scrape them well to clean them and put them in cold water to soak. Place 



BEEF. 149 

them in a saucepan side by side, not standing up, cover with good stock, boil up 
quickly and then remove to the side of the fire and cook slowly for an hour and a 
half. Take out the bones, drain them, place on a napkin spread over a dish, and serve 
with slices of hot toast. 

Beef Marrow Fritters. 

Put one-half pound of marrow, taken from the largest bones of the animal and 
kept in one piece, into cold water and let it soak. Put it in a saucepan with good 
broth, boil for ten minutes, and then let it cool in its liquor. When quite cold drain 
and cut it into two dozen slices; cover half of them on one side only with some cooked 
fine herbs, and over that again put a layer of cooked truffle and glaze it all over (both 
truffle and marrow) with a paste brush; when the glaze is cold take the pieces of 
marrow singly, dip them into frying batter and fry them; when the batter is dry and 
of good color drain the fritters, put them on a napkin folded on a dish, arrange them 
in a heap, and serve them with a garnish of fried parsley. 

Minced Beef. 

Cut some slices of cold roast beef to a half inch in thickness, and cut these into 
strips of about an equal width, slicing up finely. Place in a stewpan a wineglassful 
of port wine, a shallot chopped fine, the shredded rind of half an orange, and a 
little grated nutmeg ; season with salt and cayenne pepper, and allow it to simmer 
for four or five minutes. Then add a little brown sauce ; mix the beef with this 
preparation, adding a few drops of lemon-juice, and boil the whole again. Place in 
the middle of a dish, place a few raspings of bread over it, place some three-cornered 
pieces of bread fried in butter around it, a poached egg on each, with scallops of 
tongue in between, then serve. 

Minced Beef, Spanish Style. 

Thin slices of cold meat should be cut into strips and then into dice ; place in a 
saucepan, and brown in oil ; add a few finely-chopped shallots, one onion, and a 
green pepper cut into pieces. After becoming well-browned, about five minutes, 
put in a pint of Spanish sauce, a little salt and a like amount of pepper. Cook 
again for fifteen minutes, serving with a teaspoonful of chopped parsley scattered 
over it. 

Beef, Neapolitan Style. 

Procure a fresh piece of silverside, about six or eight pounds in weight, and 
make two or three holes in it with a carving knife, and insert in each a strip of fat 
bacon, rolled in powdered sweet herbs and pepper. Tie up the meat with tape to 
keep it in shape. Then mince some fat bacon, adding a clove of garlic, an onion, 
some parsley, thyme and marjoram ; when well mixed, put in a saucepan with the 



i 5 o BEEF. 

meat and stew, turning the meat frequently until it is well-browned on all sides ; 
then moisten with plenty of tomato sauce diluted with a little stock, and pepper 
and salt to taste. Stew the meat slowly until done, then remove the tape, and serve 
with macaroni around the dish, dressed as follows : Boil it in water, and when soft, 
mix it with some of the meat, strained from all fat, adding plenty of grated Parmesan 
cheese. The macaroni should be mixed in a warmed tureen, but not over the fire.

for about twenty minutes. Cut two ox-tails into pieces, put them into a saucepan 
with a large lump of butter and a large onion; brown, then pour in the water from 
the boiled onions, adding more water if necessary to cover them. Add of each two 
or three carrots and turnips cut in small pieces, putting in the carrots about twenty 
minutes before the turnips. Boil slowly, and when the tails and vegetables are done 
take them out and keep hot on a dish. Put an ounce of butter in another pan, melt 
it, and stir in flour enough to make it quite stiff, pour in the strained gravy from the 
tails, adding a little at a time, and stir well till it boils. Place the pieces of tails in 
the center of the dish, arrange the vegetables around them, pour over the sauce, and 
serve with the boiled onions for a garnish. 

Braised Ox-Tails with Chestnut Puree. 

Cut the thickest part of a fresh ox-tail into pieces about three inches long, soak 
them in water for a few hours, then blanch them. Put some layers of fat bacon and 
some sliced carrots and onions into an oblong stewpan, add a bunch of sweet herbs 
and the slices of tail. Add a little salt, cover them with white wine and broth mixed 
in equal quantities and put on the top some slices of fat bacon or some pork rind.

pour a little clear gravy in the bottom of a dish, lay on the tournedos, and serve. 
They should be cooked from four to six minutes. 

Boiled Tongues. 

Soak the prepared tongues over night in a liberal quantity of cold water to 
freshen them slightly, if they are salted, or blanch them if they are fresh. On the 
following day put them in a saucepan over the fire with fresh cold water for boiling 
tongues, or boiling water for fresh ones, and allow twenty minutes for each tongue 
from the time they begin to boil. A sliced lemon, or one teacupful of vinegar, and 
one teaspoonful each of whole cloves and peppercorns boiled with a large tongue, or 
less for smaller tongues, and so on in proportion, greatly improves the .flavor. When 
the tongues are done take them up, peel off the skins and return them again to the 
hot liquor to keep them warm, or if they are to be used cold let them cool in it. 
When serving them cut them into long slices, beginning near the tip. All the 
fleshy parts and the fat near the roots of the tongues will serve to make excellent 
hash when cold, but are not generally served with the tongue.

place the tongue on top and pour in enough broth and white wine to moisten to half 
its height. Cover with paper, place over a slow fire and cook until the tongue is ten- 
der, turning it occasionally so as t,o glaze it on both sides. Have ready a pure*e of 
chestnuts, moderately thick, spread it over a dish and place the tongue on it; add a 
little more broth to the liquor in the saucepan, boil well, skim and strain into another 
saucepan, reduce it to half-glaze, pour it over the tongue, and serve.

bacon. Put it in a braising pan with a few cloves, carrots and onions, a little thyme 
and parsley, two slices of fat bacon or pork, sufficient stock to moisten it and salt and 
pepper to taste. Set the pan at the side of the fire, cover it, place hot ashes on the 
top and cook slowly for about four hours. Take out the tongue when done, remove 
the skin, cut it lengthwise into halves, lay them open on a dish, pour some tomato or

tables cut in slices and a few small pieces of bacon, moisten with a little broth, cover 
the tongues with paper, put the saucepan on the fire with hot ashes on the lid, and 
cook until the tongues are quite tender. Remove and drain them; trim the thick or 
root ends, making them as round as possible, and with a sharp knife cut the tongues 
transversely to half their length and remove the top pieces. Cut these into slices and 
put them back in their places. Put a flat crouton of fried bread in the center of a 
dish, masl^ it with forcemeat poached in the oven, glaze the tongues and put them on 
it, with their root ends meeting in the middle; surround the base with a financiere 
garnishing and garnish with quenelles made with a spoon, and some larger ones 
studded with truffles. Serve with a sauceboatful of brown sauce reduced with wine. 
Should salted tongues be used thev will only require to be boiled with plenty of water 
until they are tender, and then treated as above.

put them into a saucepan with oatmeal gruel to cover, and boil it until tender. The 
tripe should be tied up in a cloth. Turn it out of the cloth, place it in a bowl of 
weak brine, let it remain for a day or so, and it is then ready for use. Or put the 
pieces of the stomach of a fat bullock, one at a time, in a saucepan of water, and

and water to the liquor in the pan, stir well until the glaze is melted, and then cool. 
Fold as many sheets of paper as there are cutlets to the size of note paper, and cut 
them so that when they open they will be in the shape of a heart. Place them in 
warm butter, and allow them to stand for a little time. When the sauce is cold spread 
it over the cutlets, and place them one at a time on the side of the papers, with the 
bones turned toward the point of the heart. When all are thus prepared range them 
on a baking-sheet and cook in the oven for ten minutes. Dress them on a dish in a 
circle, and fill up the hollow with fried potatoes.

scald it in a basin of boiling water. Scrape it well, taking care not to cut it or make 



I 9 2 MUTTON. 

any thin sfices in it, as they might burst in cooking, and place it in cold water until 
wanted for use. Clean a sheep's pluck, and let the blood ooze out of the liver and 
heart by pricking them all over with a large needle. Put the liver and lights into a 
saucepan of water, and boil for fifteen minutes, change the water and boil for fifty 
minutes longer, add the balance of the pluck, and boil for another half-hour, making 
about an hour and a half in all. Remove any part of the skin that may be discolored, 
take out the liver, cut it in halves, grate one-half of it, and mince the other half with 
the remainder of the pluck. Mince one pound of beef suet and two onions and mix 
them in with one tablespoonful of salt, one breakfast cupful of well dried oatmeal, 
one-half tablespoonful of pepper, a little grated nutmeg and some cayenne, also a 
little lemon juice and one breakfast cupful of gravy. When they are thoroughly 
incorporated put the mixture into the paunch, sew it up, leave room for swelling 
in cooking, plunge it into a saucepan of boiling water, boil up, place it at the side of 
the fire and let it simmer gently for about three hours, pricking it a little when first 
cooking to let the air escape and thus preventing its bursting. As soon as it 
is taken out of the saucepan it must be placed on a dish and served. Sufficient gravy 
will be found inside as soon as it is cut without adding any more to it. A little beef 
may also be used in the mixture, though it is not considered an improvement. If a 
lamb's paunch is used, as is sometimes the case, great care must be taken to see that 
all the thin places are well sewed up. A calf's paunch may also be used, but the 
sheep's is best 

Imitation Haggis.

cooking for about two hours, take off the paper to allow the meat to brown ; dust it 
over with salt, a little flour, and baste with butter. When quite done place it on a 
dish, put a paper frill on the shank bone, pour over one wineglassful of sherry wine 
mixed with some gravy, and serve with red currant jelly sauce. 



Stewed Sheep's Hearts. 



Wash and dry the desired quantity of hearts, make a stuffing with sifted bread- 
crumbs, two-thirds the quantity of beef suet, a tablespoonful of flour, a small quantity

of chopped parsley and sweet herbs, grated lemon peel and nutmeg, and a sprinkling of 
salt and pepper. Stuff the hearts with this mixture, dip them in milk, roll them in 
flour, place them in a saucepan broad end downward with a piece of butter and fry 
until brown all over ; then pour in one pint of stock, and simmer until the hearts are 
tender, which will take about one hour and a half. Remove the hearts, drain, and 
place them on a dish, keeping them hot while the gravy is being prepared. Skim 
the fat off the gravy, thicken it with a small quantity of flour, mix with it one wine- 
glassful of claret and one tablespoonful of powdered sugar, pour it over the hearts, 
and serve them with currant jelly. 

Irish Stew. 

The best description of this would be a neck of mutton, onions and potatoes, 
stewed, the potatoes being the only Irish ingredient in the stew ; for Irish stew is not 
a national Irish dish in spite of its name. A good recipe for it is as follows : Cut 
two and one-half pounds of loin of mutton into fairly thick chops, and cut off the 
square ends of the bones. Peel a large quantity of potatoes and cut them into slices, 
also peel about one pound of onions. Put the chops and vegetables in layers, moisten 
to their height in cold water, set the saucepan on the fire until the liquor commences 
to boil, then move it to the side and keep it simmering gently for two hours or so. 
When the meat is tender, take it out and pile the potatoes, which should be thick, in 
the center, arrange the chops around the pile, garnish the dish with whole boiled 
potatoes and a few button mushrooms, and serve hot. 

Kidney Bacon Rolls. 

Peel and chop a small onion fine, and mix it with one teacupful of grated 
bread crumb, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, the grated rind of half a lemon, 
and a small quantity of pepper and grated nutmeg. Moisten the mixture slightly 
with beaten egg, spread it over some thin slices of bacon, and place a small kidney 
on each. Roll the bacon round the kidney and tranfix it with skewers. Put the rolls 
in a baking dish and bake them in a hot oven for twenty minutes. When done put 
the rolls on a hot dish, garnish with fried parsley, and serve. Or they may be left 
until cold, and then served on a dish over which has been spread a folded napkin, or 
an ornamental dish-paper. 

Broiled Mutton Kidneys, Maitre d' Hotel. 

Place some kidneys in boiling water to soak for a few minutes, remove them, 
dry, skin, and cut them down the center. Fasten them open with skewers, sprinkle 
over salt and pepper, dip into warmed butter, place them on a gridiron with the 
opened side downwards, and broil thoroughly. Dress them on a dish with a mixture 
of minced parsley, lemon-juice, salt and pepper and maitre d'hotel butter in the 
center and serve very hot. 



MUTTON. 195 

Curried Mutton Kidneys. 

Pour one wineglassful of rich gravy or brown sauce into a saucepan with one 
tablespoonful of butter well-kneaded with curry powder, and boil until it is fairly 
thick. Meanwhile cut two or three onions in rings, fry them over a moderate fire to 
color slightly, sprinkle over a little salt, and drain them. Put in a dozen mutton 
kidneys, skinned and minced very finely in a fryingpan with a little butter, and fry them 
until done. Place them on a strainer to remove all the fat, arrange them on a dish, 
pour the sauce over them and decorate with the rings of fried onions and potato 
croquettes. 

Deviled Kidneys. 

Remove the skin from as many kidneys as may be required, parboil them in a 
small quantity of water, cut down the center and dip in warmed butter. Dust over 
with salt and pepper and a little cayenne if desired, broil over a clear fire, and serve on 
a dish with some butter worked in with minced parsley, pepper and salt. 

Mutton Kidneys, French Style. 

Skin the kidneys, cut them into quarters, put them into a fryingpan with a lump 
of butter, and fry them, dredging lightly over with flour. When the kidneys are 
nearly cooked, put in a few chopped mushrooms, some chopped shallots and parsley, 
and a small wineglassful of sherry or white wine, seasoning to taste with salt and 
pepper, and finish frying them, stirring constantly at the same time. When cooked, 
turn the kidneys on to a hot dish, garnish with slices of lemons, and serve. 

Fried Kidneys. 

Cut some kidneys in halves down the center without severing, remove all the 
skin and fat, and sprinkle with cayenne and salt. Place them in a heated fryingpan, 
pour on a little clarified butter, fry quickly, and serve upon sippets of toast. Add a 
little catsup or sauce to the gravy, and pour it over before serving. 

Fried Mutton Kidneys with Curry Sauce. 

Trim four kidneys, cut them across in fine pieces, fry them in butter till nicely 
cooked, season with salt and pepper. Put one ounce of butter into a stewpan with 
one-half tablespoonful each of curry powder and flour, a little salt, and stir over the 
fire until mixed; then pour in gradually two-thirds of a breakfast cupful of clear broth, 
and continue stirring until it boils. A small quantity of finely-chopped onions may 
be used to flavor the sauce, or the stewpan may be first rubbed over with garlic. 
When ready, put the kidneys on a hot dish, pour the sauce over them, garnish with 
sippets of toast, or small croutons of bread that have been lightly fried in butter, and 
serve. 



196 MUTTON. 

Mutton Kidneys in Border. 

Mould a border of chicken forcemeat or potato and turn it on to a hot broad 
round dish. Fill the center with sliced mutton kidneys prepared by stewing in 
Madeira and then masking half of the slices with Spanish sauce and the remaining 
half with veloute. This gives a very pretty and artistic effect, the slices of kidney 
partaking of two colors, brown and white. Great care is required in arranging the 
slices to give them the appearance of being loosely tossed together. Prepare a sauce 
from the wine stock by thickening it with roux, season with pepper and salt, and 
serve separately in a sauceboat. 

Kidneys on Skewers. 

Remove the skin from a few kidneys and cut them nearly through, keeping them 
spread out by the use of skewers. Dip in a little warmed butter, put them on a but- 
tered gridiron and cook for eight minutes, turning often. Place them on a dish, add 
a little chopped parsley, lemon juice, pepper and salt to the butter, pour over it, and 
serve. 

Mutton Kidneys in Terrine. 

Put some mutton kidneys into a fryingpan with a little butter and fry them 
slightly; they should not be cut open for this. Place them in an earthenware ter- 
rine with a few slices of onions also browned in butter, and add a slice of lean bacon, 
two potatoes and two carrots also cut in slices; pour over one pint of stock or water, 
put on the lid, set the terrine in the oven, and cook gently for about three hours. 
When done take them out, put the terrine on a dish covered with a folded napkin, 
and serve. 

Stewed Kidneys. 

Skin, wash and dry some kidneys, cut them into round slices and dust with salt 
and pepper. Put one tablespoonful of butter and half that quantity of flour into a 
fryingpan, and when it is hot put in the kidneys, stir for two or three minutes, add 
one gill of water or stock and boil it up, stirring in one teaspoonful of lemon juice. 
Pile four tablespoonfuls of mashed potatoes on a plate, arrange the slices of kidney 
around the potatoes and then pour over and around the potatoes the gravy, which 
should be very thick, then garnish the dish with small pieces of toast. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton with Caper Sauce. 

Cut off the shank bone from a leg of mutton, trim and make an incision at the 
first joint; put it on to boil in a stockpot filled with cold water and salt slightly, add 
a bunch of parsley and one carrot cut up. Boil for an hour or more, and, according 
to size, serve with a pint of hot caper sauce made by putting a pint of hot Hollandaise 



MUTTON. 197 

sauce into a saucepan and heating thoroughly without boiling for five minutes, and 
then adding a heaping tablespoonful of capers, or else an ordinary caper sauce may 
be used instead. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton with Oyster Stuffing. 

Take a dozen or more large oysters, remove the beards and uneatable parts, par- 
boil them, chop them up with boiled parsley, onion and sweet herbs, adding the yolks 
of two or three hard-boiled eggs. Make five or six incisions in the fleshy part of a 
leg of mutton, put in the stuffing, tie it up in a cloth and boil in a saucepan with plenty 
of water for from two to two and one-half hours, according to size. When done re- 
move the cloth, place on a dish, and serve at once. 

Braised Leg of Mutton. 

Put a leg of mutton in a braising pan with some slices of fat bacon on top and 
underneath it; put in also four carrots, two onions, a few meat bones, a bay leaf, a 
bunch of sweet herbs, and three gills of gravy. Put the pan over a fire with hot 
ashes on the cover, and cook the contents slowly until done. Remove the leg of mut- 
ton, place it on a dish, and glaze; take off the fat from the gravy to strain, pour it 
over, and serve. 

Braised Boned Leg of Mutton, Milanese Style. 

The following recipe is a favorite dish of the Milanese, but the Italians of Rome 
and Naples are not so fond of it, as they think it has a woolly flavor. Remove the bone 
from a leg of mutton, and bone it as follows from the thick end down to the first 
joint; chop it off at the first joint, push in a knife near the joint to loosen the flesh, 
leaving the tendons and gristle on the bone; then commence at the small or tail end 
and scrape away the fat from the backbone and follow the bone up until the joint is 
reached, continuing in this way until all the bone is out. The cavity may be stuffed 
and sewed up at the thin end. Then bring the edges together at the upper end, push- 
ing all the flesh inside and sew the skin tightly together, which will give a rectangular 
form of solid meat and stuffing. To cut it straight down to the bone or to take it 
out would spoil it and much of the juice would escape, and if sewed up it would be very 
unsightly, but by this way the juice is preserved, and when the meat is cold it does not 
become dry and hard. Fill the cavity with breadcrumbs soaked in broth and 
squeezed quite dry, adding a mixture of garlic, eggs, mushrooms, bacon, ham and 
pepper. Sew up the place where it was cut so that the stuffing will not fall out, and 
put it in an earthenware stewpan, with some small pieces of melted fat bacon. Put the 
pan over the fire and fry gently until it is a light color, turning often. Sprinkle over 
salt and pepper, add a few vegetables cut in slices, and pour in a wineglassful each of 
white wine and broth. Cover with a round of paper, put some hot ashes on the lid, 



198 MUTTON. 

and braise for about four hours, adding a little more broth occasionally, and when 
done put it on a dish and keep hot. Add a little gravy or broth to the liquor 
in which it was cooked, bring to a boil, strain it, remove all the fat, and reduce quickly 
to half glaze, thickening it with a few tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, keeping it quite 
light. Pour a little of the sauce over the leg, put the remainder in a sauceboat, gar- 
nish with potato croquettes and Brussels sprouts in piles, and serve hot. 

Leg of Mutton, Provincial Style. 

Take two or three each of cloves of garlic and anchovies cut into fillets, and 
lard a leg of mutton with them. Roast the mutton in a quick oven, keeping it well 
basted. Boil one or two more cloves of garlic, changing the water often, and when 
nearly done, drain and refresh them with cold water. Drain again, put into a stew- 
pan with one breakfast cupful each of stock and gravy, and boil until reduced to a 
thick creamy consistency. When cooked place the mutton on a hot dish, pour the 
sauce around it, garnish with vegetables, and serve. 

Roasted Leg of Mutton. 

Take a leg of mutton, wipe it dry, sprinkle it over with pepper and flour, chop 
off the knuckle bone, remove the thick skin, and trim the flank. Place in a roasting 
dish, add a little water and salt, put in the oven, and baste frequently. Allow about 
fifteen minutes for every pound if the oven is very quick, and twenty minutes if the 
oven is slow. When done, put it on a dish, pour the gravy round, and serve with 
some currant jelly on a separate dish. If the leg is too large for roasting, it can be 
divided, and the knuckle end either boiled, or the cut end covered witli paste made 
of water and flour, and boiled. 

Roasted Boned and Stuffed Leg of Mutton. 

The principal difficulty in accomplishing this dish is the boning. This must be 
done with a very sharp knife. Commence on the under side of the joint, passing the 
knife under the skin until exactly over the bone; then cut down to it, pass the knife 
around close to the bone right up to the socket, remove the large bone of the thickest 
end of the leg, seeing the meat is clear of the bone, draw out the remaining bones, 
which will come away easily, and stuff the cavity with highly seasoned forcemeat. 
Fasten the knuckle end tightly over, replace the bone at the base of the joint and 
sew it in. Place in front of a clear fire, baste well until done, and seive with gravy. 

Roasted Leg of Mutton, Portuguese Style. 

Take a medium-sized leg of mutton take out the shank bone, trim well and make

of butter over and roast for one hour in a pan, basting occasionally with the gravy 
and turning it once in a while. Remove from the oven, place on a hot dish and serve 
with three stuffed tomatoes and three timbales of cooked rice, straining the gravy 
over it or it may be garnished with red or white beans cooked in gravy. 

Loin of Mutton in Papers. 

Saw the chine bone off the neck end of a loin of mutton, trim to a nioe shape, re- 
moving all the gristle and superfluous fat ; lay it in a deep dish with plenty of finely- 
sliced carrots and onions, some peppercorns, cloves, sweet herbs and two or three 
bay leaves ; season with salt and chopped parsley, moisten well with the best olive oil 
and leave the meat in the marinade for one day. Afterwards spread the marinading 
vegetables and oil over a large sheet of paper, lay the meat on them, binding it in 
position with tape. Roast it in a slow oven and when nearly done remove the paper 
and vegetables and brown the meat. Peel some potatoes and cut them into slices, 
and fry in a stewpan with butter, adding some finely chopped parsley until lightly 
and equally browned. When done, place the mutton on a hot dish, and serve it with 
the potatoes. 

Roasted Rolled Loin of Mutton. 

Take a loin of mutton weighing about three pounds, remove all the bones, take out 
the fillet and mince it very fine. Add to the mince an equal quantity of bread- 
crumbs, one minced shallot, a little chopped parsley, salt and pepper to taste and 
sufficient egg to make it into a stiff paste. Put this on the mutton, tie it over tightly 
with a string, rub it well with flour, sprinkle some salt and pepper over it and place it 
in a slow oven to roast. Put a few onions into a fryingpan with the bones, fry them 
until they are brown, pour in a little stock and thicken with flour. Place the 
meat when done on a dish, pour the gravy round, and serve with a garnish of glazed 
onions. 

Roast Stuffed Loin of Mutton. 

Bone a loin of mutton and then beat it with a rolling pin to flatten it as much as 
possible. Mix together one-half ounce of sweet almonds blanched, boiled for ten 
minutes, and pounded to a paste, one-fourth pound of mutton suet, chopped fine, one 
ounce of sifted breadcrumbs, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one-half teaspoonful 
of mixed herbs, powdered or chopped fine, a seasoning of pepper and salt, a very little 
cayenne, a little grated nutmeg and grated lemon peel, the yolks of two eggs and the 
white of one. When this stuffing is thoroughly mixed, spread it evenly over the 
inner side of the mutton, roll it neatly, skewer, tie and then roast it in a warm oven, 
keeping it well basted ; put the bones in a pan over the fire, with half a head of 
celery, half a carrot, an onion, a shallot and a very small piece of garlic ; pour over 
them about one pint of water and let them stew for three hours. Strain the liquor 
and add to it a little salt, one teaspoonful of soy, one dessertspoonful of mushroom 



200 MUTTON. 

catsup, and one tablespoonful of flour, blended smooth with a little of the liquor, 
before mixing it with the whole quantity. Stir it till it boils and boil for ten minutes, 
stirring occasionally, then mix in one glass of sherry wine. When the mutton is 
dished pour the gravy over it, and serve very hot. 

Minced Mutton. 

Remove all the fat, skin and gristle from some cold cooked mutton, chop it up 
very fine, and pour over Italian sauce in the proportion of one pint of sauce to every 
pound of meat. Warm up thoroughly, without boiling in a saucepan, over a clear 
fire. Turn it out onto a dish and garnish with poached eggs or pieces of fried bread, 
and serve very hot. 

Neck of Mutton, Brittany Style. 

Chop off the chine bones and scrags of two necks of mutton, trim them to a nice 
shape, and roast in a hot oven, keeping them well basted. Put one pint of white 
beans to soak in water over night, drain and put in a saucepan with fresh water, one 
ounce of butter and a lump of salt ; boil until tender. As the beans will require much 
longer cooking than the mutton, they should be put over the fire some length of time 
before. Peel and thinly slice three large onions, put them in a stewpan with a lump 
of butter or clarified fat, and fry until nicely browned, dredge a small quantity of 
flour over, and pour in two breakfast cupfuls of clear gravy. Stir the sauce over the 
fire until it boils, put in the beans with a piece of glaze the size of a walnut, season 
to taste with salt and pepper, and stir until the glaze has dissolved. Place the 
mutton on a hot dish, pour the sauce around, and serve. 

Stewed Neck of Mutton, Duchess Style. 

Select a whole neck of mutton with the scrag end attached, weighing about three 
pounds, wash it well, sprinkle with flour and fry in a frying-pan until well browned. 
Put it in a saucepan with sufficient stock to cover, and add a carrot, two turnips and 
six small onions. Cover closely and cook slowly until the vegetables are thoroughly 
done; remove the vegetables, place them on a dish and keep warm. Continue to cook 
the mutton until done, which will take about four to five hours altogether. When 
done remove to a dish and keep hot. Let the gravy in the pan cool, remove the fat, 
and then reduce it quickly to about one pint; thicken with one tablespoonful of flour 
mixed smooth with two tablespoonfuls of stock. Put in the meat again and cook 
slowly for thirty minutes. Chop up the vegetables, put them into a saucepan with a 
little butter, toss over the fire until they are quite hot, and arrange on a dish in small 
piles around the mutton. Other cooked vegetables may be used as a garnish if desired. 



MUTTON. 201 

Mutton on Skewers. 

Cut a leg or loin of mutton into small, equal-sized pieces, rub them over with 
finely-chopped onion, salt and pepper, lay them on a plate, place another on top, and 
leave them for a few hours. Cut a pound of tomatoes into halves, put them in a 
mortar and press them to extract the juice, which pass through a fine hair sieve. 
Place the pieces of meat on skewers, put them over a brisk fire and turn them often 
so as to brown evenly, basting them with the tomato juice. When they are cooked 
lay them on a hot dish, and serve very hot. If fresh tomatoes are not in season take 
about one teacupful of the liquor of canned ones, strain it through a fine hair sieve to 
free it of all pips, and mix it with one breakfast cupful of water. 

Minced Mutton Patties. 

Line some buttered patty pans with thin paste, fill them up with flour or rice, 
place in a moderate oven and bake. Take out when done, remove the flour or rice,

the onions and a lump of butter, into a fryingpan and fry until brown. Mince finely 
a piece of mutton, fry it in butter for a few minutes and add it to the above. Place 
four of the flats of paste over each other, moistening between them with one spoonful 
of warmed butter, then put the mince mixture over in small quantities, a short dis- 
tance from each other. Moisten the paste round the mincemeat with a paste-brush 
dipped in water, then cover with the remaining pieces of paste ; press over each lot of 
mincemeat with a teacup, and cut round. Butter a bakingtin, lay the pieces on it, 
baste them with warmed butter, and bake in a moderate oven. When cooked and 
well colored, arrange on a dish and serve.

butter in a fryingpan to heat, put in the balls and fry till nicely browned. Drain 
them out and put in the remainder of the butter, three thinly sliced onions, and two 
tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley to fry for a few minutes ; place the onions and 
parsley at the bottom of a stewpan, lay the balls on them side by side, pour in three 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar and sufficient clear broth to cover, and boil slowly for half 
an hour. When done, place the balls on a hot dish, pour their cooking liquor around 
them, and serve. 

Braised Saddle of Mutton. 

Remove the kidneys from a saddle of mutton, cut off the skin covering the fat 
of both fillets and cut off the flaps or skirts and roll them up underneath. Place 
some slices of fat bacon in a braising pan, tie the meat around with twine, lay it in 
the pan and add an onion and a carrot cut in slices; season with salt, pour in a pint 
of broth and reduce over a clear fire; then pour in water to half its height and braise 
slowly. When nearly done remove and drain out the meat, pass the liquor through 
a conical sieve, skim off the fat and add a little white wine. Put the fat with the 
mutton into a saucepan and finish the cooking in a slow oven, basting frequently and 
letting it get a good brown. When done place it on a dish and garnish with mashed 
vegetables, and serve with the strained liquor in a sauceboat. 

Saddle of Mutton in Surprise. 

Scoop out the meat from a cold saddle of mutton, cutting it close to the bone 
and leaving an outside thickness of about one and one-half inches wide. Mince the 
meat fine with a little of the fat and mix with it two tablespoonfuls of chopped 
onions fried in a little butter, sprinkle over one tablespoonful of flour and one salt- 
spoonful each of salt and pepper, add one bay leaf and a little cayenne. Pour a

melted, cook slowly for twenty minutes, pour over the marinade liquor, add two 
bay leaves, and a few cloves of garlic. Let it cook for five minutes longer, then draw 
the pot to the side of the fire, cover it with a piece of paper, lay a plate on top, and 
stew slowly until the meat is done. When ready take out the meat, place on a dish, 
skim off the fat from the liquor, add two or three tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, 
boil it up once, pour it through a fine sieve over the meat, and serve it with a dish 
of rice. 

Stewed Mutton, Farmer's Style. 

Put into a saucepan three pounds of breast or shoulder of mutton cut in small 
squares, with one ounce of butter, and six small onions. Cook for ten minutes or till 
of a good golden color. Add three tablespoonfuls of flour, mix well together, and 
moisten with three pints of light broth or water, stirring continually while boiling. 
Season with one tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper, and one-half tea- 
spoonful of nutmeg, adding two carrots and two turnips cut into small pieces, a bunch 
of sweet herbs and one crushed clove of garlic. Boil over a moderate fire for thirty 
minutes ; put in one-half pint of Lima or white beans, and let the whole cook again 
for fifteen minutes Skim off the fat well, remove the parsley, and serve. 

Mutton Stew, Turkish. 

Cut some leg of mutton into small pieces, wash, put in a saucepan with sufficient 
water to cover, season with salt and pepper, and boil till tender. Scald one breakfast 
cupful of chick peas, put them in with the meat, skimming the liquor, and boil until 
tender. Slice three onions, fry them until brown, then add them to the stew. Place 
some slices of toast in the bottom of a hot dish, pour the stew over, and serve. 

Timbale of Mutton. 

Put some macaroni into a stewpan with a small lump of butter and milk 
and water to cover, boil for a few minutes, then strain off the liquid. Pour over the 
macaroni a small quantity of clear stock, and cook slowly until tender. Chop some 
cold mutton, also one or two slices of bacon, put them in a stewpan with the macaroni, 
add the grated peel of half a lemon, and season highly. Grate in one ounce of cheese 
and toss the whole over the fire until hot, then turn onto a plate and let it cool. 
Butter a mould, strew grated breadcrumbs in and line it with puff paste. When the 
mixture is quite cold, put it in the mould, cover it with paste, trimming off neatly 
round the edges, press them together, and bake the timbale in a rather slow oven. 
When cooked turn it out of the mould onto a dish, cut off the top and glaze 
the timbale. Arrange in the opening left by the removal of the top some freshly 
prepared and chopped salad; garnish round the dish with parsley, slices of cucumber 
and red radishes, and serve very cold. 



206 MUTTON. 

Braised Sheep's Tongues with Lettuce. 

Steep the tongues in warm water with a little flour in it until the blood has 
soaked out of them, and blanch them, then put the tongues in a stewpan with a good 
braise, and then let them cook slowly. Wash and blanch as many cabbage lettuces 
as there are tongues, drain them as free as possible of water, open and cut out 
the stalks, dust them with salt and pepper, and tie them in their original form. Line 
a stewpan with slices of fat bacon, put them in the lettuces, moisten to their height 
with broth, and stew them until tender. When cooked, peel the tongues, drain the 
lettuces, and squeeze them in a cloth to extract the grease. Arrange the tongues 
and lettuces on a hot dish alternately, pour a Spanish sauce over them, and serve. 

Grilled Sheep's Tongues. 

Boil the required number of sheep's tongues, skin them, and cut them into slices; 
spread over each a mixture of pepper, salt and curry powder, roll them up, fasten 
them with skewers, wrap them in paper, place them on a gridiron and grill them. 
Serve hot. 

Sheep's Tongues in Papers. 

Wash the tongues and blanch them until the skins can be easily removed, and 
then peel them off. Place them in a stewpan, cover with nicely flavored stock and 
boil until tender. Butter as many sheets of paper as there are tongues, and over 
each spread a mixture of finely-chopped mushrooms and sweet herbs that have been 
worked up in a lump of butter and seasoned with pepper and salt. Drain the tongues, 
lay them on pieces of paper and wrap them up well so that none of the seasoning can 
escape. Place them on a gridiron and broil over a clear fire, turning them when done 
on one side. Spread a folded napkin on a hot dish, lay the tongues in the papers on 
it, garnish with fried parsley, and serve. 

Stewed Sheep's Tongues. 

Put two or three sheep's tongues into a saucepan with water and boil them until 
the skin can easily be removed, which will take about two hours. Skin, cut them 
lengthwise into halves and put them in a saucepan with a little parsley, chopped shal- 
lot, mushrooms, butter, pepper and salt, and pour over sufficient gravy to moisten. 
Place the saucepan on the fire and cook gently until the tongues are tender. Put 
them on a dish, strain the gravy over them, and serve. 

Casserole of Sheep's Trotters with Rice. 

Blanch a number of small sheep's trotters, remove the long bone and split each 
foot in two lengthwise. Put two chopped onions, a carrot, a turnip, three bay leaves, 



MUTTON, 207 

a small bunch of thyme, and a few cloves into a stewpan with a little dripping or 
chopped suet, and fry them over a slow fire for about ten minutes, then sift in two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, mix it well, pour in by degrees two quarts of white stock, add 
the feet with a small lump of salt, and allow the whole to simmer by the side of the 
fire until quite tender, then drain them on a cloth. Pour one quart of white sauce and 
one pint of the strained cooking liquor of the feet into a saucepan and boil it quickly 
until reduced to a thick cream, then put in the feet with about twenty button mush- 
rooms and two or three tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, season with pepper and 
salt and let them simmer for a few minutes. Beat the yolks of two eggs with one 
teacupful of cream, stir them in with the above mixture, not allowing them to boil 
after the eggs are added; squeeze the juice of half a lemon into this, turn it into a 
casserole, and serve. 



Sheep's Trotters, Poulette. 



Put about a dozen sheep's trotters into water the day before they are required. 
Split the hoof in two, take out the woolly tuft, trim them neatly, tie them together in 
fours, scald and put them into a saucepan with two or three carrots, turnips and 
onions, peeled but left whole, and season with cloves, peppercorns and a bunch of 
parsley and sweet herbs. Mix one tablespoonful of flour with a little water, pour it 
into the saucepan, cover the feet with cold water, stand the saucepan over a moderate 
fire and let the water boil for six hours. Take out the feet, drain them, remove the 
shank bone, place the feet in an empty saucepan and leave them with the cover on. 
Fry a large chopped onion in butter with one-half teacupful of flour until nicely 
browned. Put one quart of broth into another saucepan and drop in a bunch of 
parsley and a few mushroom trimmings; stir in the flour and onions and continue 
stirring over the fire until the broth boils; then move it to the side and let it simmer 
for fifteen or twenty minutes. Skim it clear of fat and pass it through a conical- 
shaped strainer into the saucepan containing the feet; then add two ounces of button 
mushrooms, peeled and trimmed, and a pinch of pepper. Beat the yolks of three 
eggs with a little milk and in twenty minutes' time stir them into the broth, with five 
or six small lumps of butter, a little lemon juice and one teaspoonful of chopped 
parsley. When cooked sufficiently arrange the feet upon a dish, garnish with crou- 
tons of fried bread ; they are then ready to be served. 

Sheep's Trotters, Vinaigrette. 

Trim a dozen sheep's trotters, split their hoofs and remove the tuft which is 
found between the toes; tie them together in fours, place them in a saucepan with 
cold water and set it over the fire until the water boils; then remove the feet, rinse 
them in a little cold water, put them in the saucepan with fresh water, add two or 
three carrots and turnips, one large onion stuck with four cloves, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, a few sprigs of parsley and some peppercorns and salt, and let them simmer by 



208 MUTTON. 

the side of the fire for about five hours. When done remove the feet, untie them, 
take out the shank bones carefully so as not to tear the flesh, lay the flesh on a plate, 
sprinkle over some chopped parsley, pepper and salt and let them cool. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs with two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, dip the feet into it, roll 
them in finely-grated breadcrumbs and broil them in front of a clear fire, turning till 
browned on both sides. Baste with a little butter, and serve with either tartar or 
mayonnaise sauce. 



. Pork. 

Bacon and Eggs. 

The rashers of bacon, cut from the back, must be trimmed of all bone, rind and 
smoked part, and put into a hot fryingpan very clean. Cook until nicely browned, 
but without burning, taking care that the fat does not "catch." When the bacon is 
laid on a dish, the shells of the eggs must be carefully broken so as not to break the 
yolks, each being broken separately and kept from one another. As each egg is 
added to the fryingpan, the white should be allowed to set before adding another. 
Baste them with hot fat, trim and put one on each piece of bacon. Mashed potatoes 
may be served around the sides of the dish if desired. 

Bacon and Spinach. 

Line a pudding-dish with thin slices of raw bacon trimmed to one size and 
arranged symmetrically. Take boiled spinach ready chopped for the table, and 
season with butter, salt and pepper, also some boiled carrots, turnips and boiled 
onions. Whip up the yolk of an egg, with pepper and salt, and mix the carrots and 
turnips with the egg and seasoning. Arrange the squares of vegetables alternately 
amongst the slices of bacon, and place in a saucepan partially filled with boiling 
water, but not deep enough to boil over, and steam for an hour. Turn out on a flat 
dish and serve with a rich brown gravy. 

Boiled Bacon and Cabbage. 

This dish may also be prepared with broad beans, in lieu of the cabbage ; in 
either case the process is the same, and is as follows : Cut a good cabbage into 
quarters and remove some of the thick part of them, as much as can be done without 
disturbing the leaves. Soak in a pan of cold water until it is wanted. Put the cab- 
bage into a large saucepan containing some water boiling, with a teaspoonful of salt 
and a pinch of bicarbonate of soda, and cook for half an hour. Take some good 
bacon, cleaning off the smoky parts, place in cold water and then boil for half an 
hour separately. Drain both the cabbage and the bacon and put them together in 
one pot, covering them with boiling water which has not been used before, and let 
them cook slowly for another half-hour. Remove the cabbage as whole as possible, 
drain on a colander, and, after slicing the bacon, serve it on the cabbage in a dish with 
a drainer.

210 PORK. 

Broiled Bacon. 

Broil in a double gridiron in front of a clear fire some slices of streaky bacon 
nicely trimmed, turning frequently till done. Or the slices cut to one size may be 
rolled up and stuck on skewers when they may either be broiled or baked in an oven. 
Remove from the skewer before serving. 

Broiled Liver and Bacon. 

As broiling in most cases is wasteful, the liver and bacon are generally fried 
together, but the dish is somewhat spoiled by this method. The best plan is to fry 
the well-trimmed slices of bacon, and after having washed and sliced the liver not too 
thick, say a third of an inch, dry it thoroughly on a cloth, flour it and dip into the 
bacon fat in the fryingpan and broil over a clear fire, adding pepper and salt while 
cooking. When done, lay each slice on a dish with a piece of bacon on each piece 
of liver. 

Fried Bacon. 

Select a piece of streaky or back and trim off the rind, bone and smoky portions 
before slicing. Cook in a fryingpan until the fat is transparent and the lean lightly 
browned on both sides and crisp. Drain on paper, and serve. 

Preparing Bacon for Breakfast. 

The bacon must be fresh and in fine condition. It is cut with a keen knife, the 
under bones being cut off, and both edges pared neatly, also the end opposite from 
the string for hanging it up. Then cut up the requisite number of slices for im- 
mediate use, and no more. Thin slices are always preferable, so that the bacon, 
whether boiled or fried, will be crisp and tasty. When cutting the slices, be careful 
not to detach the skin; also cut crosswise, but never lengthwise. Arrange on the 
broiler, and broil over a moderate fire for two minutes on each side. Dress on a hot 
dish, serving at once. Four minutes is plenty of time for the frying. 

Bacon Salted, Dried and Smoked. 

The previous description applies precisely with regard to the salting and drying. 
The next step is the smoking. The smoke is generally that of burning wood or 
straw, hickory chips or corncobs. Woods containing resins, such as pine, are not 
advisable, as they would give an unpleasant flavor to the bacon. They are usually 
dried slowly over the smoke made by burning sawdust, oak or beach, the fire being 
kept night and day by smothering with dry sawdust. The flitches should be hung up 
high until quite dry, but not so hard that the rind begins to peel off. Sometimes the 
rubbing over the flitch with bran is advocated, although not especially recommended, 



PORK. 211 

as it encourages flies to settle on it. This may be prevented by wrapping in bags 
before they are suspended. 

Bacon with Macaroni. 

Place a couple of ounces of macaroni with a little well seasoned stock in 
a saucepan, and simmer gently on the side of the fire until quite tender, which will 
take about an hour, but care should be taken that it is not allowed to become over- 
done or pulpy. Add a little streaky bacon boiled and cut into squares, and a small 
lump of butter. Toss the pan over the fire for a few moments, seasoning with salt 
and pepper, then turn onto a dish, and serve very hot. 

Baked Pork. 

The skin, if left on, should be well scraped with a dull knife, and afterwards wiped 
thoroughly with a wet cloth and scored into little squares. If, however, the skin has 
been removed trim off some of the loose fat, cut out the chine or backbone, disjoint- 
ing it from the ends of the ribs so that it may facilitate the carving of the meat. Place 
in a drippingpan a few slices of carrot, turnip and onion, together with a dozen cloves, 
whole, a teaspoonful of peppercorns and a few leaves of parsley or celery; lay the 
pork upon the vegetables, place the pan in a moderate oven and cook to a brown, 
when it may be seasoned with salt, pepper and pounded sage, and finish the cooking, 
allowing about fifteen minutes to each pound of the meat. One hour before the pork 
is done prepare the garnish as follows: Procure a dozen peeled white onions, break 
the layers apart and put them in a pan, with a teaspoonful each of sugar and butter, 
with a little salt and pepper, set the pan in the oven, occasionally shaking it, in order 
to move the onions about and insure their browning with uniformity; after the onions 
have been prepared wash four sour apples, quarter them, and remove the cores, put 
them into a pan with barely enough water in to cover, and a tablespoonful of butter 
on each and bake them until they are tender, but do not allow them to become broken, 
and keep both the onions and apples hot, serving them with the pork. When the 
meat is done place it on a hot dish and arrange the onions and apples in little groups 
around it, and serve with a dish of plain-boiled potatoes with brown gravy. The gravy 
may be prepared by pouring out nearly all of the drippings trom the pan in which the 
pork was cooked, leaving in the scraps of vegetables, set the pan over, the fire and stir 
in a heaped tablespoonful of flour, cook it until brown and then add a pint of boiling 
water, gradually a little at a time, season the gravy with salt and pepper and again 
boil for a moment or two, strain and it is ready for serving with the pork. 

Broiled Pork with Chili Sauce. 

Prepare the chili sauce before cooking the meat, and in a goodly quantity, as it 
will keep for a considerable length of time. The cutlets are to be about half an inch 
in thickness and cut from a leg of fresh pork. Place them between the bars of a double 



212 PORK. 

gridiron over a moderate fire and cook them for about twenty minutes. When done, 
place them on a hot dish, sprinkle over a little salt and pepper, put a little butter over 
them, and serve with a sauceboatful of chili sauce. 



Broiled Pork Chops. 



Cut from a loin of pork the required quantity of chops, trim them neatly from 
all fat and place them in a fryingpan and fry for a few minutes. Remove and put 
them on a gridiron or grill over a clear fire and broil them until done. Pour into a 
frymgpan with the fat from the chops, a breakfast cupful of milk and add a little salt 
and pepper, thickening with a small lump of butter rolled in flour. Pour the sauce 
onto a dish through a fine sieve, arrange the chops in it, and serve. 

Curried Pork. 

Remove the skin and most of the fat from two and a half pounds of pork and 
chop it into small thin slices, which place in a saucepan with a little butter, frying 
them for a few minutes, then add four onions cut up into small pieces and fried, 
a tablespoonful each of curry-powder and paste, and add a little salt and pepper to 
taste. When thoroughly mixed, pour in two breakfast cupfuls of water or stock, 
place the pan over the fire, and, as soon as it boils, remove to one side and let it cook 
gently for from three quarters of an hour to an hour, then take out the pieces of 
meat, place them on a dish and reduce the liquor to half its original quantity, after 
which pour it over the meat, and serve garnished with a border of well boiled rice, 
or, if preferable, the rice may be served separately. 

Pork Cutlets and Anchovy Sauce. 

Broil on a well-greased gridiron over the fire seven nicely cut and trimmed 
cutlets of pork ; place some anchovy sauce warmed on a very hot dish; put frills on 
the bones of the pork cutlets, and lay them around the dish, overlapping each other, 
and serve very hot, garnished with fried parsley. 

Fried Pork Cutlets. 

Cut off all the skin and most of the fat from a loin of pork, and chop it up into 
cutlets, which place in a fryingpan with a lump of butter, and fry to a good golden 
brown color. In the meanwhile, put the bones, skin and any trimmings of bacon or 
ham, into a saucepan with a couple of onions cut into slices, and when they become 
well browned, pour over them sufficient water to nearly cover, and boil for two hours, 
then strain and skim off all fat ; pour into another saucepan with a little isinglass to 
thicken it, and mix in a little browning to color. Brush the cutlets over with this 
glaze, put them on a dish and pour over a little tomato sauce, serving quickly.

Pig' 



S 



Ears. 



These are esteemed as food principally on account of their crisp, cartilaginous 
character. 

Baked Pig's Ears. 

Singe off all the hair from half a dozen or so pig's ears, and scrape and blanch 
them. Let them get cold, put them into warmed butter, rub them over with bread 
crumbs, covering them completely, then dip them into well-beaten yplk of egg, and 
breadcrumb them again. Put them in a baking dish in a moderate oven, and bake 
until done and lightly browned. Take them out, place on a dish, pour over some 
remoulade sauce and serve. 

Braised Pig's Ears. 

Thoroughly clean the required quantity of pig's ears, singe off all the hair, and. 
scrape them. Put a layer of slices of fat bacon at the bottom of a braising pan, place 
the ears on it, sprinkle over with salt and pepper, add a few slices of carrots and 
onions and a bunch of sweet herbs. Pour in sufficient stock to moisten, set the pan 
on the fire with hot ashes on the lid, and let them cook till they are done. Strain 
the liquor through a fine sieve, skim off the fat, arrange the ears on a dish, pour the 
liquor over, and serve very hot. 

Pig's Ears, Lyonese. 

Singe off all the hair from some pig's ears, scrape, wash them well, and cut 
lengthwise into strips. Put them into a saucepan with a little stock, add a small 
quantity of flour, a few slices of onions fried, and salt and pepper to taste. Place the 
pan over a slow fire, and simmer the liquor until the ears are thoroughly cooked. 
Arrange them on a dish, add a little lemon juice to the liquor, pour it with the onions 
over the ears, and serve with a garnish of slices of fried bread. 



Boiled Pig's Feet. 



Wash some pig's feet well, put them over the fire in a stewpan, with just water 
enough to cover, and as soon as the water boils remove the pan from the fire, strain 
off the water, and plunge them in a bowl of cold water. Clean the pan and put the 
feet into it again, with two quarts of water, one tablespoon each of salt and vinegar, 
and one ounce of flour blended smoothly in a little cold water. Put the pan over the 
fire and stir the contents till they boil, then place over a slow fire and simmer for four 
hours. Place the feet on a hot dish, pour over some good white sauce, and serve hot. 

Broiled- Pig's Feet. 

Thoroughly clean as many pig's feet as are required, split them lengthwise in 
halves, tie them round with broad tape so that they will not open, or shrink in cook- 



214 PORK. 

ing, put them in a saucepan with a seasoning of parsley, thyme, bay leaf, allspice, 
carrots and onions, with sufficient water to cover, and boil slowly till tender, then let 
them cool in the liquor. Dip them in beaten yolks of eggs and warmed butter; 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cover with breadcrumbs, seasoned with very finely 
chopped shallot and parsley. Put them on a gridiron over a clear fire, and broil 
until well and evenly browned. Unbind and arrange them on a dish and garnish 
with fried parsley, or they can be served with Robert sauce. 



Crepinettes of Pig's Feet. 



Put the four feet of a pig in a saucepan of water, and boil them till they are 
quite tender ; take them out, drain, and cut them in slices about one-half inch in 
thickness. Put some pig's caul in a basin of water to steep, take it out, drain 
and wipe it dry on a cloth. Prepare some forcemeat with knuckle of veal and fat 
bacon in equal quantities and mixed with a little spiced salt ; spread a layer of this 
over the caul about one-fourth inch thick, three inches long, and one and one-half 
inches wide. Have ready some truffles, cooked in Madeira and cut in slices, arrange 
a few of them on some forcemeat and then a few pieces of the pigs' feet. Cover 
over the whole with another layer of the forcemeat, and then roll over the caul so as 
to form an oval, three inches in length and two inches in width. When the required 
number of crepinettes are made, dip them in warmed butter, then roll them in bread 
crumbs, place them on a gridiron over a clear fire, and broil slowly for fifteen 
minutes, or until they are a light brown color. Put them on a dish, and serve with a 
little perigueux sauce in a sauceboat. 

Fricasseed Pig's Feet and Ears. 

Clean and wash the feet and ears of a pig, cut them up in small pieces, put them 
in a saucepan with one pint of milk, and boil for an hour. Strain off the liquor, and 
put the pieces of meat in another saucepan, add a breakfast cupful of veal broth, a 
small onion, the peel of half a lemon, and a little powdered mace. Simmer over a 
slow fire until well done, then mix in one gill of cream, one ounce of butter well 
rolled in flour, and one saltspoonful of salt, warm up again, turn all on to a dish, and 
serve very hot. 

Stewed Pig's Feet. 

Place a couple of thin slices of bacon at the bottom of a stewpan, put in the feet 
with a blade of mace, a few peppercorns, two or three sprigs of thyme, and enough 
good gravy to moisten them to height, and boil slowly. When quite tender, split each 
foot lengthwise into halves, and lay them open on a hot dish; strain their cooking 
liquor into a small saucepan, mix with it a small lump of butter that has been kneaded 
with flour, and the bacon from the stewpan, first cutting it up into small pieces. Let 
the sauce simmer at the edge of the fire for two or three minutes, then pour it over 



PORK. 215 

the feet, garnish them with small croutons of bread that have been nicely browned in 
butter, and serve. 

Stuffed Pig's Feet, Perigueux. 

To one and one-half pounds of boned turkey forcemeat, add two minced truffles 
and one-half wineglass of Madeira wine, and mix well together in a bowl. Shred 
six pieces of crepinette (a skin found in the stomach of the pig) the size of the hand 
on a table, lay on each one a piece of forcemeat the size of an egg, spread it well, 
and lay one-half of a boned pig's foot on top. Cover with another light layer of 
forcemeat, and finish each with three thin slices of truffles. Cover the crepinettes so 
that they get the form of envelopes, fold them up and dip them one after the other 
in beaten egg, then in breadcrumbs, and cook in a sautepan with two ounces of 
clarified butter. Place a heavy weight on top of the feet, cook on a slow fire 
for twelve minutes on each side, and serve with one-half pint of hot perigueux sauce 
on the dish, and the pig's feet on the top; or they may be served with hot Madeira 
sauce. 

Broiled Fillets or Tenderloins of Pork. 

Prepare, trimming well, a dozen fillets of pork, and dip them in warmed butter, 
then breadcrumb them all over, and put them on a gridiron over a clear fire, and broil 
them until done, then arrange them on a dish, and serve with a little poivrade sauce 
in a sauceboat and any desired vegetables which may be in season. 

Fillet of Pork, Hunter's Style. 

Remove the meat from a leg of pork weighing about five pounds and stuff the 
cavity where the bone has been taken out with well-seasoned pork stuffing, score the 
skin and lard the upper or thick surface with thick lardoons of pork; place a few 
slices of bacon fat, carrots, onions and a bunch of sweet herbs in a braising pan and 
put the meat on top, brown the latter a little and add a little brown stock and vinegar 
to moisten, cooking until the meat is thoroughly done; then remove the meat and 
place it on a hot dish to keep it warm; drain the liquor, thicken it with a little dis- 
solved gelatine, adding coloring if required, and reduce the liquor by boiling and 
afterward pour it over the meat, and serve very hot. 

Hams. 

With a sharp knife cut round the knuckle and lengthwise along and right down 
to the edge of the bone until the aitch bone is reached; then make a straight cross- 
cut right around, and the bone can be removed. Keep the ham hung up in a dry 
place and when any slices are required as for frying or boiling they are easily obtained 
and the skin trimmed off. 



2 i6 PORK. 

Baked Ham. 

Put about a ten-pound ham into a bowl with a good supply of water and let it 
soak for twelve or fourteen hours. Remove it, trim off all the uneatable parts from 
the underneath side and spread it over thickly with a paste of water and flour. Place 
it in a baking dish and set the dish in a well-heated oven and bake for about four 
hours. When done remove, take off the flour and water crust, skin, brush over with 
glaze or grate a little crust of bread over it, place a paper frill on the knuckles, and 
serve with a garnish of vegetables cooked and cut up into various shapes. By cook- 
ing a ham in this wa^ '* is stewed in its own juice and is very full of flavor. 

Baked Stuffed Ham. 

Boil the ham until it can easily be skinned, remove the skin, and gash the ham 
to the bone ; fill up the cuts with a forcemeat of sifted breadcrumbs, a very little 
thyme, finely chopped parsley, a seasoning of salt and pepper, and enough butter to 
mix these ingredients to a paste. Brush over the ham with the well-beaten yolks of 
eggs, dust it with sifted breadcrumbs, and bake slowly until quite done. Or if a 
hot boiled ham be served up, and only a small portion of it used, the spaces where 
the slices have been taken from may be filled with forcemeat, brushed over with 
beaten egg, sprinkled with breadcrumbs, and put into an oven until browned, the 
ham being already sufficiently cooked. 

Braised Ham. 

Choose a lean ham, partly bone it, without going to the first joint of the first end, 
saw the shank bone, trim the meat, and soak the ham in water for twelve or thirteen 
hours. Tie it in a cloth, place it in a large saucepan, cover with water and boil for 
four hours with a few cloves, peppercorns and sweet herbs, excepting bay leaves. 
When cooked remove the ham, drain it, peel off the rind, put it in a narrow braising- 
pan, pour a bottle of Madeira wine over, place the cover on, and boil until reduced, 
being careful to baste frequently. Drain, place on a hot dish, mix a little brown 
sauce with the cooking stock, reduce it, and then add two tablespoonfuls of red cur- 
rant jelly. Strain the sauce through a fine hair sieve over the ham, and serve with 
vegetables. 

Boiled Ham. 

Wash the ham, place it in a saucepan, and cover it with hot water ; simmer 
gently for about five hours, then move the saucepan on one side of the fire, and let 
the ham remain in the water for an hour or two longer. When it is almost cold 
remove, sprinkle over baked breadcrumbs and three or four tablespoonfuls of fine 
moist sugar. 



PORK. 



Broiled Boned Ham. 



217 



Wash a ham, place it in a saucepan, cover it with cold water, and boil it for four 
or five hours, according to its size. Take out the bone, roll the ham, place it in a 
basin with a large weight on the top. When cold put it on a dish, garnish with 
parsley, and serve. 

Broiled Ham. 

Either freshen a slice of ham by soaking it in icewater over night, or by heat- 
ing it in enough water to cover it ; then wipe dry, put it between the bars of a grid- 
iron and brown slightly on both sides. Season with salt and pepper, and serve either 
plain or with fried eggs. 

Ham Cooked in Madeira Wine or Champagne. 

Put a ham into a bowl of cold water, and let it soak for a day and a night ; take 
it out, drain it, put it into another saucepan, pour over it one pint of Madeira or cham- 
pagne, and cook gently until done. Put it on a dish, pour the liquor over, and serve 
hot with a garnish of cooked vegetables. 

Ham Croquettes. 

Chop very small one-fourth of a pound of ham, mix with it an equal quantity of 
boiled and mashed potatoes, two chopped hard-boiled eggs and one tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley, seasoning all to taste; then stir in the yolk of an egg. Flour the 
hands and shape the mixture into small balls; put some fat in a fryingpan, and when 
it is hot place the croquettes in the pan and fry them an equal brown all over; place 
them on a hot dish, garnish with parsley, and serve. For a light luncheon or a late 
supper dish these croquettes are well suited, or they may be served for breakfast. 

Deviled Ham. 

Cut some thin slices of ham, spread them with mustard mixed with oil and vine- 
gar, place them in a baking dish and cook in the oven. Boil some potatoes, mash, 
put a mound of them on a dish, arrange the pieces of cooked ham against the mound, 
and serve. Tartar sauce is sometimes served with this dish. 

Fried Ham. 

Cut off a thick slice of ham, place it in a saucepan over the fire in sufficient cold 
water to cover, and let the water come to the boil. Pour it off, put the ham over the 
fire and fry slowly until it is brown on both sides. Then season with pepper, and serve. 
Eggs are usually served with fried ham. They may be fried in the same pan or sep- 



2i8 PORK. 

arately in sufficient fat to prevent burning, seasoned with pepper and salt, and placed 
round the dish and over the ham. 

Frizzled Ham. 

Cut about one pound of fat ham into as thin slices as possible. Put a fryingpan 
over the fire, and let it become smoking hot, then put in the slices of ham and fry for 
two or three minutes ; dust them with dry flour, and cook until the flour is brown. 
During this time mix one tablespoonful each of vinegar and dry mustard together. 
When brown add the mustard and vinegar, and sufficient boiling water to cover the 
ham. Boil gently for a moment, and serve. Eggs may be cooked with the ham in 
place of the flour and water. 

Ham and Chicken Pie. 

Trim off the skin of some cold chicken, and cut the meat into small pieces 
(chopping it), mix with it an equal quantity of finely chopped lean ham and a small 
lot of chopped shallot. Season with salt, pepper and pounded mace, and moisten 
with a few tablespoonfuls of white stock. Butter a piedish, line the edges with puff 
paste, and put in the mixture ; place a flat of puff paste on the top, trim it round the 
edges, moisten and press together, punch a small hole in the top, and bake in a 
moderate oven. When cooked pour a small quantity of hot cream through the 
hole at the top of the pie, stand the piedish on a flat dish, and serve- 

Roasted Ham. 

Choose a small ham, soak it for an hour in fresh water, pare the surface, place 
it in a large saucepan, and cover with cold water ; when boiling move the saucepan 
to the side of the fire, and let it simmer for three-quarters of an hour ; then drain 
the ham, remove the thighbone, and peel off the rind. Put it in a basin, pour in 
enough cooked marinade to cover, and let it macerate for about twenty-four hours, 
with the pan covered. Drain the pan, mask it with a vegetable mirepoix, cover it 
with two or three buttered sheets of paper, put it on a cradle-spit, and roast before a 
clear fire, basting now and then with fat. In the course of three-quarters of an hour 
mix some of the marinade in the drippings, and baste the ham with it. Remove the 
papers from the ham in another hour's time and roast thirty minutes longer. W r hen 
cooked take it off the spit and place it on a hot oval dish ; strain the stock from the 
dripping-pan, skim off the fat, reduce some of it to half glaze, mix with it one tea- 
cupful of brown sauce, stir it over the fire again for two or three minutes, then pour it 
over the ham, and serve with vegetable croquettes in a separate dish. 

Ham Steaks. 

Cut some slices of raw ham of moderate thickness and put them into a frying- 
pan with a little water; let it boil, turn the steaks and continue boiling until dry, 



PORK. 219 

sprinkle them with flour, pour over a teacupful of milk, put in a small lump of butter, a 
teaspoonful of mixed mustard and a little cayenne. When it boils put the ham on a 
hot dish, pour over the sauce, and serve. 

Hashed Pork. 

Cut into slices some cold boiled or roast pork and sprinkle with some salt and a 
small quantity of cayenne; then place in a saucepan over the fire an ounce and a half 
of butter, a small teaspoonful of mustard, a dessertspoonful of walnut liquor, and a 
similar quantity of soy or mushroom catsup. Heat the sauce well and put into it the 
slices of pork and let them get well-heated through and through, but taking good 
care that the sauce does not come to a boil; lay the pork on a hot dish, squeeze a few 
drops of lemon juice over the sauce and pour it over the pork, and serve. 

Baked Pig's Head. 

Cut a pig's head into halves and thoroughly clean it, take out the brains, trim 
.the snout and ears and bake it in a moderate oven for an hour and a half. Wash the 
brains thoroughly, blanch them, beat them up with an egg, salt and pepper, some 
finely-chopped or pounded sage, and a small piece of butter. Fry or brown them on 
the fire, and serve with the head. 

Boiled Pig's Head. 

Take out the bone from half a pig's head, rub it over with salt and put it into a 
basin with a few sweet herbs, cloves and peppercorns. Pour over one-half pint of 
vinegar and let it remain for a day or so. Take it out, drain, wipe it dry on a cloth, 
singe it and cut it in pieces; put them in a saucepan, pour in the strained vinegar 
pickle, add a little water and a few vegetables cut in pieces, place the pan over the 
fire, bring to a boil, then cook over a slow fire for four hours. Take out the pieces 
of meat, trim the outer sides of the tube of the ear, place it in the center of the dish 
with the pieces of meat round it, pour over some poivrade sauce, and serve. 

Pig's Kidneys, Maitre d' Hotel. 

Clean and wash some pig's kidneys, cut them down the center without quite 
dividing them and run them through with a skewer to keep them fast. Rub them 
with a little butter, sprinkle over salt and pepper, put them on a gridiron over a clear 
fire, and broil for fifteen minutes. Take them off when done, remove the skewers, put 
them on a dish, pour over a little maitre d'hotel sauce, and serve. 

Stewed Pig's Kidneys. 

Put a couple of pig's kidneys in a little cold water and steep them for a few 
minutes. Take them out, drain, cut them into slices and put them in a saucepan 



220 PORK. 

together with two ounces of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, half as much minced 
parsley, two chives, one saltspoonful of pepper, and a wineglassful of Madeira; place 
the pan on the fire and cook the contents gently without letting them boil for fifteen 
minutes. They must be stirred constantly, as they are very likely to burn. When 
done, put them on a dish, and serve very hot. Pig's kidneys may also be cooked in 
the same way as sheep's if desired. 



Roasted Leg of Pork. 



Select a leg of pork weighing about six pounds, and score the rind evenly; place 
it on a bakingpan and set it in the oven, turning it frequently to insure even cooking; 
this will require about three hours for this weight of meat; baste frequently with its 
own drippings, and when done, place it on a dish, thicken the gravy with a little flour 
and butter, pour it over and serve with a sauceboatful of tomato sauce. 

Roasted Loin of Pork, Bordelaise. 

Trim off most of the fat from half a saddle of pork, take out the spine bone, and 
slightly score the fat, and stick in each end a clove of garlic; truss the loin and place 
it in a baking pan with half a pint of water and sprinkle it over with powdered sage, 
salt and pepper; cover the meat with a sheet of buttered paper, and roast in a mod- 
erate oven, basting it frequently. When it has cooked for an hour and ten minutes, 
place a few button mushrooms around it, and baste them with the liquor in the pan; 
then take out the pork, put it on a dish, and garnish it with cooked mushrooms; skim 
off th'e fat from the gravy, adding to it a few tablespoonfuls of rich gravy or a little 
glaze, boil it up once, and pass it through a fine sieve or strainer over the meat, and 
serve. 

Roasted Loin of Pork, French Style. 

Select a large loin of pork, score and cut off the minion or small fillet, remove 
the skin and take out the sinews, and chop fine; add an equal bulk of breadcrumbs to 
the minced meat, and mix in a little sage and parsley, together with one small onion, 
all finely chopped, sprinkle a little salt and pepper over, and form it into a stiff paste 
with the yolks of three eggs; fill the cavity of the loin where the fillet was taken 
from with this stuffing, and cover it with a piece of pig's caul, then fill the flap, and 
tie up the loin, after which set it in front of a clear fire, roasting it for an hour. Place 
it on a dish, sprinkle over with salt, pour over a little piquant sauce or rich gravv, 
and serve. 

Roasted Marinaded Pork. 

Trim well all the skin from a piece of pork, rub it thoroughly with salt, place in 
a deep dish with a few sliced onions, sage leaves, thyme, basil, a few juniper berries 
and cloves, dusting it over with plenty of pepper ; baste the meat with four or five 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and let it stand for a few days ; basting and turning it two 



PORK. 221 

or three times a day, then put it together with the other ingredients in a baking dish, 
place it in the oven, and bake it until half cooked, take the dish out of the oven, pour 
in boiling water, and stir it thoroughly ; strain the gravy through a fine hair sieve, return 
it to the oven, and finish cooking it, basting the meat well while baking. Put the meat 
on a hot dish, skim off the fat from the sauce and strain it through a fine hair sieve. 
Pour it over the meat, and serve. 

Minced Pork. 

Chop up finely a couple of pounds of fresh lean pork, and break up half a pound 
of stale bread, soaking it till soft in three-quarters of a pint of milk ; mix together 
the minced pork and soaked bread, with two well-beaten eggs, and season with 
pepper, salt and powdered sage ; place this mixture in a buttered earthenware dish, 
place it in a moderate oven and bake for two hours, and serve hot with fried apples. 

Pickled Pork. 

After the pig has been dressed and is cool enough to cut up, pack the side 
pieces in a cask, with a liberal quantity of salt, and pour in enough water to come to 
the top of the pork ; place a cover over, with a heavy weight on top, keeping the 
pork well excluded from the air until it is wanted. 

Baked Pickled Pork and Beans. 

Place in a saucepan of water one quart of white beans, which have been pre- 
viously soaked for twelve hours in water, and boil them gently until they are done 
and can be easily pierced with a pin ; great care should be used not to boil them too 
fast, as they will break open ; a small chopped onion may be boiled with them if 
desired. Turn them out into a colander, and pour cold water over to cool them. 
Put three quarters of a pound of salted pork, after cutting it into strips, three or four 
in number, into a deep baking dish, and pour in enough boiling water to cover. 
Bury the pieces of pork in the beans, then put one teaspoonful of salt into a basin, 
and stir in a teaspoonful of mustard mixed with half a teacupful of molasses ; pour in 
enough water to make the entire quantity half a pint, and pour this mixture over the 
beans and pork, adding enough more of the boiling water to make them well mois- 
tened. Place the dish in a moderate oven and bake for an hour ; then turn the beans 
out onto a dish, and serve with the pieces of pork in the center. A teaspoonful of 
bicarbonate of soda should be added to the saucepan in which the beans are being 
boiled, as it will destroy the acid taste of the skins. 

Boiled Pickled Pork and Cabbage. 

Pare, divide, and cut into quarters a medium-sized cabbage, wash well and par- 
boil for about ten minutes, and then place them in a vessel with a pound of well- 



222 PORK. 

washed salt pork, three sausages, a branch of celery, an onion, two large carrots, a 
blade of mace, a bay leaf and a sprig of thyme, half a pinch of pepper, but no salt, 
and cover over with buttered paper ; simmer over a gentle fire for an hour and a 
half, and then remove the cabbage with a skimmer and place it on a dish, together 
with the pork and the sausages, laying them on top ; garnish the dish with the 
balance of the vegetables, and serve. 

Pork Pie. 

Take one pound of flour, a quarter of a pound of lard, and half an ounce of butter, 
rub about two-thirds of the" lard into the flour, and melt the rest with the butter in a 
small quantity of hot milk and water ; skim it well and mix it in slowly with the 
flour, adding a little salt and some more of the milk, if found necessary to make the 
paste of the desired consistency ; knead it thoroughly and raise the crust to an oval 
shape ; cut some rather lean pork into slices, season it with chopped sage, salt and 
pepper, and a very little each of cayenne and mace ; put the pork into the crust and 
cover it ; trim the edges of the paste, moisten and press them together. Then roll 
out the trimmings of the paste, cut them into leaves, moisten at the bottom, and 
ornament the top of the pie with them, leaving a small hole in the top of the crust. 
Place it in a moderate oven and bake for two hours or more, according to the size of 
the pie ; then with the trimmings of the pork prepare some well seasoned gravy, and 
when the pie is done filter it through the hole at the top of the crust, serving either 
hot or cold, as may be desired. 

Stewed Stuffed Ribs of Pork. 

Select a young loin of pork and joint the bone; peel, core, and cut into quarters 
enough cooking apples, and stuff the pork with them, trussing it so as to keep them 
in securely; lay the meat on a baking dish, baste with a few tablespoonfuls of warmed 
butter, and bake in a brisk oven until lightly browned all over. Then lay the meat 
in a stewpan, pouring in a breakfast cupful of clear, boiling broth over it, put on the 
lid, and keep it at the side of the fire, stewing slowly for a little more than two hours, 
basting the meat frequently, and adding a little water from time to time, as it becomes 
reduced by the boiling. When the meat is done place it in a hot dish, skim off the 
fat from the cooking liquor, and strain through a fine hair sieve over the pork. 

Roasted Saddle of Pork. 

Select a good saddle of pork, remove the fat and skin, and cover it with a well 
buttered sheet of paper, and roast it in a hot oven until done, allowing about twenty 
minutes to each pound of meat. Baste constantly, and when cooked put it on a dish 
and serve with a little brown gravy poured over, and a little Robert sauce or 
tomato sauce in a sauceboat. 



PORK. 223 

Baked Sausages. 

Place twelve sausages on a baking dish, prick them a little, and separate them 
by twelve slices of bread cut the same length as the sausages. Bake in the oven for 
twelve minutes, basting them occasionally with their own liquor, and serve on a 
metal dish with one-half pint of hot Madeira sauce in a sauceboat. 

Bologna Sausages. 

Chop fine one pound each of beef, veal, pork and rather fat bacon; mix well with 
the above ingredients three-fourths of a pound of beef suet, also chopped fine, and 
season with sage, sweet herbs, salt and pepper. Press the mixture into a large skin, 
tie it tightly at both ends and prick it in several places. Put the sausage into a sauce- 
pan, cover it with boiling water and let it boil slowly for an hour. When cooked 
place the sausage on straw to drain. 

Country Sausage. 

Prepare a sausage forcemeat and divide it into small portions, flour the hands 
and roll it into balls. Put some butter in a fryingpan and when it is hot fry the balls, 
a few at a time, adding more butter when required. Turn them constantly and when 
equally browned drain them, put them on a hot dish, garnish with fried parsley, and 
serve. 

Deviled Sausages. 

Steam some pork sausages for an hour, then leave them until cold. Cut some 
pieces of bread about two inches in length and one and one-half inches wide and fry 
them in butter to a pale golden color. Drain them and mask them with a thin coat- 
ing of curry paste. Skin the sausages and cut them lengthwise into thin slices, then 
cut each slice into halves, place half a slice of sausage on each piece of bread and 
spread a little mango chutney over them. Put them in the oven with a cover over 
and leave until hot. Spread an ornamental dish-paper over a hot dish, place the sau- 
sages on it, garnish them with slices of lemon and fried parsley, and serve. 

Frankfort Sausages. 

Any part of the pork may be used for these sausages, having the same quantity 
of fat that there is lean; mince the meat finely and season it with ground coriander- 
seeds, salt, pepper and a small quantity of grated nutmeg; the quantity of seasoning 
may be judged according to that of the meat. Fill the skins (they should have been 
well cleansed and steeped in cold water, salted, for a few hours), secure them well at 
the ends, and hang them in a cool dry place until wanted. 



224 PORK. 



Fried Sausage Meat. 



Turn some sausage meat out of the skins and divide and roll it into small balls; 
wrap each ball in a thin rasher of bacon and pass a skewer through to keep it on. 
Put them in a fryingpan with a little butter and fry lightly. When cooked lay them 
on a hot dish that has been spread with a folded napkin, or a fancy dish-paper, and 
garnish with fried parsley and small croutons of fried bread. Serve immediately. 

Ham Sausages. 

Mince about five pounds of unsmoked ham fine, if in cold weather, one pound 
of hog's leaf, or inner pork fat, and cut it into small squares. Season the mince with 
three ounces of salt, one-half ounce of coarsely ground black pepper, a few whole 
peppercorns, and one-half teaspoonful of saltpetre. Mix the seasoning well into the 
mince and moisten it slowly with two or three tablespoonfuls of rum or port wine, 
then mix in the fat. Cover the mixture and leave it for a few hours. Cleanse well 
and prepare some skins, tie them round the bottom, then pass the mixture through 
them into a funnel. When the skins are well filled tie them into lengths about one 
and one-half feet in length. In about twelve hours time tie the sausages closer if 
possible, and bind them round from one end to the other with broad tape; fasten the 
tape well at the ends. Hang the sausages for nearly two weeks in cool smoke, then 
remove them from the smoke and place them in a cool, dry place until wanted. 
When the sausages are filled care should be taken that no air spaces are left; should 
there be any they should be pricked through with a long, thin iron skewer. 



Pork Sausages. 



After emptying and cleaning thoroughly the intestines of an ox, cut the skins 
into the necessary lengths and place them in a basin of salted water or a weak solu- 
tion of lime water and allow them to remain there for three or four days, turning 
them frequently inside and out. Then remove them from the solution and clean 
them thoroughly by scraping inside and out and place them in a basin of slightly 
salted water, letting them remain in it until they are wanted for use, when they are to 
be well drained. Meanwhile, place ten pounds of pork with a fair quantity of fat in 
a bowl of pickle and let it remain there for one week, and then remove, drain and 
mince it very fine, sprinkling over it a quarter of a pound of salt, one ounce of pepper 
and a little allspice, say about one teaspoonful. Place the sausage meat in the skins, 
filling them as full as possible and securely tying both ends, wrap muslin around them 
and smoke them for twelve to fourteen days, then take out and rub well with pepper 
hanging them in a cold place until they are wanted, when they should be boiled, and 
when cold, cut into thin slices, and served. 



PORK. 225 

Pork Sausages Boiled in White Wine. 

Place in a stewpan half a dozen sausages, together with half a pint of white wine, 
sprinkling over a small quantity of pepper, set the pan over the fire, covering it over 
with the lid and boil the contents gently for about eight minutes, then remove the 
sausages and place them on a dish, add a teacupful of poulette sauce to the liquor and 
reduce it for four minutes, then take the pan from the fire and stir in an ounce 
of butter and one tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley. After the butter has 
melted, pour the liquor over the sausages and serve. 

Smoked Sausages. 

Mix with ten pounds of fine-chopped beef, one teacupful of salt and one pinch 
of saltpetre, add four pounds of chopped pork and two pounds of chopped fat bacon; 
season the meat with eight ounces of cumin, four ounces of pepper, two ounces of 
pimento, all of which must be ground. Peel and chop a few cloves of garlic, mix 
them with the above ingredients and chop all together for a few minutes longer, ad- 
ding by degrees at the same time one pint of water. Fill some pig's intestines with 
the mixture, tie them into small sausages and smoke them for a few hours. Boil the 
sausages for five minutes then drain them cool. 

Stewed Sausages with Cabbage. 

Procure a medium-sized white cabbage, remove all the green leaves, and cut it 
into quarters, removing the center stalks. Wash thoroughly in cold water, drain well, 
cut them into small pieces, put them into boiling salted water for five minutes. Re- 
move it to cold water to cool moderately, take out the pieces of cabbage, drain in a 
colander and put into a saucepan with one gill of fat from soup stock or one ounce of 
butter. Season with a pinch of salt and one-half pinch of pepper and a whole me- 
dium-sized onion and a carrot cut into quarters. Put on the cover of the saucepan, 
set it on a moderate fire and cook for half an hour. Take twelve sausages, prick them 
with a fork, add them to the cabbage and allow all to cook together for twelve min- 
utes. Dress the cabbage on a hot dish and arrange the sausages and carrot on top. 
Serve very hot. 

Westphalian Sausages. 

Use uncooked pork, the fat and lean of which should be as nearly as possible in 
equal quantities; cut it up into small squares, and for every pound of meat season with 
one-half ounce of salt and a small quantity of freshly-ground black pepper. Thor- 
oughly clean a number of pig's skins and soak them in cold-salted water for one or 
two hours. Fill the skins with the sausage mixture and hang them up to smoke. 
When sufficiently smoked they may be prepared for serving when liked. If the sau- 



226 PORK. 

sages are to be eaten fresh they will be improved by hanging another week in a cool 
and very dry place. 

Roasted Shoulder of Pork. 

Remove the bone from a shoulder of pork and spread it over inside with a stuf- 
fing of sage and onions, filling the cavity where the bone was taken out; roll up and 
secure it with a string, place it in a pan and roast in a good hot oven until done. Put 
it on a dish, skim off the fat from the pan, adding a little water to it and a table- 
spoonful of made mustard, boil the gravy up once and pass it through a strainer over 
the meat, and serve. 

Suckling Pig. 

The suckling pig should not be more than a month or six weeks old, and if pos- 
sible it should be dressed the day after it is killed. The first step is to scald it, and 
this should be done as follows : Put a large pan of water over the fire to boil. Soak 
the pig in cold water for fifteen minutes, then plunge it into the boiling water, hold it 
by the head and shake it about until the hair begins to loosen. Then take it out of 
the water and rub it vigorously with a coarse towel until all the hairs are removed. 
Cut the pig open, remove the entrails, and wash it thoroughly in plenty of cold water. 
Dry the pig on a towel, cut the feet off at the first joint, leaving sufficient skin to turn 
over, and keep it wrapped in a wet cloth until ready for use. 

Baked Suckling Pig. 

Choose a small, plump pig. Use the liver, heart and lights for the dressing, after 
first putting them over the fire in salted boiling water, and boiling them until tender, 
or mincing after browning them in butter. Peel and grate an onion, put it over the 
fire in a fryingpan with two tablespoonfuls of butter, and fry it slowly ; mince the 
heart, liver and kidneys, add them to the onion ; soak two breakfast cupfuls of bread 
in cold water until soft, then squeeze it in a towel to extract the water, and put it with 
the minced mixture and onions ; season the mixture highly with salt, pepper, ground 
sage, and marjoram, and stir it till it is scalding hot. Use this stuffing for the pig, 
sewing it up ; truss it so as to keep the legs in place, put it into a dripping pan just 
large enough to hold it, and bake it in a moderate oven. For the first hour baste it 
with butter and water, after that with butter alone. If the ears and tail seem in 
danger of browning, wrap them in buttered paper, season it two or three times with 
salt and pepper while it is being basted, A medium-sized pig will take from two to 
two and one-half hours to bake. When the pig is done put it on a dish to keep hot 
after removing the stitches which retain the stuffing, and garnish with brussel sprouts 
and potato croquettes. Place the dripping-pan over the fire, stir in one tablespoon- 
ful of flour, and brown it ; then add equal quantities of boiling water or wine, or 
three parts of water and one of mushroom or walnut catsup. Let the gravy thus 
made boil once, season it with salt and pepper, and then serve it with the baked 



PORK. 227 

pig. The stuffing may be varied by using mashed potatoes instead of the soaked 
bread. Apple sauce is the usual accompaniment. Cold-slaw and cranberry jelly or 
stewed cranberries are used in America with roasted or baked suckling pig. Prepare 
the apple sauce as follows : Peel, quarter, and core some tart apples, stew them to a 
pulp over a slow fire, adding at first three tablespoonfuls of water to one pint of apples 
to prevent their burning ; when the apples are stewed to a pulp, stir with them a 
tablespoonful of butter to each pint of the sauce, and then use it either hot or cold. 

Timbale of Suckling Pig. 

Cut up half a small suckling pig into small pieces, and put them in a saucepan 
with a little mirepoix and white wine, and boil them. Take out the pieces of meat 
and let them cool, removing the bones, if any. Add a little calfs-foot jelly to the 
liquor and clarify it. Pack a large-sized timbale mould in ice, place poached eggs 
intermixed with sliced gherkins and slices of beet-root in the bottom and round the 
sides, dipping each into half-set jelly to keep them fixed in their places. Pour a thick 
layer of jelly at the bottom of the mould, and when it is set and firm, arrange the 
pieces of pig's meat, alternating with minced gherkins and whole capers, taking care 
to leave a hollow space in the center. Fill this cavity with almost cold but stiff 
liquid jelly and let it set firm. Turn the timbale out onto a dish, and serve with a 
little horseradish sauce in a sauceboat. 

Boiled Pig's Tails. 

Trim and well wash four or five pig's tails, put them in a saucepan of salted water 
and boil until done. Take them out, drain, wipe them on a cloth, and arrange on a 
dish over a puree of peas. Put a few chopped mushrooms in a fryingpan with a little 
butter, and fry till quite brown; put them in a saucepan with a little stock, reduce it, 
and add the yolks of one or two eggs to thicken. Pour it when ready over the tails, 
and serve. 



Veal. 

Attereaux of Veal and Ham. 

Cut into slices about one-fourth of an inch in thickness a quantity of cold cooked 
veal and lean ham. Divide these into flat squares about one inch wide each way. 
String them on small steel or silver skewers, arranging the ham and veal alternately, 
commencing with a veal square and ending with the same. Dip the attereaux into 
egg, roll them in breadcrumbs, and fry them for a few minutes. Take them out, 
arrange on a dish on a folded napkin. Garnish them with sprigs of fried parsley and 
serve as hot as possible. They are held in the hand by means of a table napkin, and 
the pieces are taken off the skewer with a fork to.be eaten. 

Blanquette of Veal and Ham. 

Cut one and one-half pounds of cooked veal into pieces, and mix it with one-half 
pound of cooked ham, also cut into pieces. Put the meat into a saucepan with one 
pint of cream sauce, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, a small quantity each of pepper 
and salt, and boil it. When boiling, move the saucepan to the side of the fire, add 
the yolks of two eggs that have been beaten with one teacupful of milk, and stir by 
the side of the fire for a few minutes. Turn the blanquette out onto a hot dish, 
garnish with slices of hard-boiled eggs, and serve. 

Blanquette of Veal with Mushrooms in Croustade. 

Cut some cold roasted fillet of veal into collops one and one-half inch in diameter, 
and one-fourth of an inch thick, slice one-fourth of the quantity of mushrooms, and 
mix them with the veal in some allemande sauce. Prepare a paste croustade two 
inches high, and the same size as the dish on which it is to be served, make the 
blanquette hot, turn it into the croustade, and serve. 

Blanquette of Veal with Noodles. 

The same as for Blanquette of Veal, arranging one-fourth of a pound of cooked 
noodles round the serving dish as a border. 

Blanquette of Veal with Peas. 

Prepared the same as for Blanquette of Veal, adding one pint of cooked green 
or canned blanched peas two minutes before serving.

VEAL. 229 

Boudins of Veal. 

Chop fine the remains of some cold veal and stir in with it some finely chopped 
bacon and parsley; season to taste with salt, pepper and the smallest quantity of

with pepper and salt, lay them on top of the ham and butter and fry them over a 
moderate fire. Drain the fat off and pour on one-half teacupful of Spanish sauce and 
one tablespoonful of broth. Dish the cutlets, strain the sauce, pour it over them, and 
serve. 

Veal Cutlets, St. Cloud Style. 

Lard six veal cutlets with two small truffles, one ounce of cooked beef tongue, 
and one ounce of larding pork, all cut in the same fashion. Place them in a saute- 
pan with a pinch of salt, one sliced onion and one sliced carrot, and allow them to 
brown for ten minutes, taking care to keep the lid on the pan. Moisten with one- 
half pint of broth, and place them in the oven to finish cooking for at least fifteen 
minutes. Serve with a hot salpicon sauce poured over the dish, and the chops placed 
on the top. 

Calf's Ears, Financiere Style. 

Cut off the ears, blanch and place in a saucepan with a little stock or water, and 
boil until quite tender. In the meantime cut a crouton of bread about two inches 
square at the base, and three inches high, fry in lard and put in the center of a dish. 
Take out the ears, dry them on a cloth, and stand them on the dish, leaning them 
against the bread ; put a heap of financiere garnishing in the spaces between the ears, 



VEAL. 241 

with a truffle and a cockscomb added. Put four cockscombs on the top of the 
bread, and a large truffle on top of them, and serve with some financiere sauce separate 
in a boat. 

Fried Calf's Ears with Tomato Sauce. 

Boil eight ears, and let them cool in the liquor, drain, wipe dry, and cut up into 
quarters. Place them in a basin and dust over with chopped parsley, salt and 
pepper ; flour them separately, dip into well-beaten egg, and then into sifted bread- 
crumbs. Put them into a fryingpan with plenty of boiling lard, putting in a few 
at a time, and fry them for about ten minutes. Then take them out, drain, pile on a 
dish, pour around tomato sauce, and serve. 

Calf's Feet as Mock Terrapin. 

Boil eight feet till tender; remove the meat from the bone and put in a stew- 
pan with one-half pint of the liquor in which they were boiled and three tablespoon- 
fuls of butter. Mash the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs with one teaspoonful of 
dry mustard and a small pinch of cayenne, adding salt to the taste. Mix the egg in 
with the meat and stir over the fire for fifteen minutes and add two wineglassfuls of 
white wine. Dish, garnish with croutons of fried bread, and serve. 

Boiled Calf's Feet. 

Split each of three feet into halves and, after removing the large bones, put 
them to soak in fresh water for one hour. Wash thoroughly, drain and place them 
in a saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of flour and three or four quarts of water. Stir 
well; add one gill of vinegar, one onion, one carrot (all cut into shreds), twelve 
whole peppers, a handful of salt and a bunch of garnished parsley, and cook briskly 
for an hour and a half. Drain thoroughly, and serve with any kind of sauce. 

Fricassee of Calf's Feet. 

Soak four calf's feet for three hours in cold water; allow them to simmer in 
equal proportions of milk and water until they are sufficiently tender to remove the 
soft part from the bones, dip them in the yolk of an egg, spread fine breadcrumbs 
over them, season with pepper and salt, and fry to a light brown in butter. Serve 
with white sauce. 

Calf's Feet Fritters. 

Cut into thick slices some boiled calf's feet, dip them into beaten egg, roll them 
in breadcrumbs and fry in boiling fat to a light brown. Fry some slices of onions, 
place them in the center of a hot dish, arrange the pieces of feet around, and serve, 
or they may be garnished with fried parsley. 



242 VEAL. 

Grilled Calf's Feet. 

Remove all the bones from a blanched calf's foot, cut the flesh into rather small 
pieces, egg and breadcrumb them and grill until they are of a light brown, then serve. 

Stewed Calf's Feet. 

Put a well-cleaned calf's foot into a saucepan with four onions, two or three 
cloves, one bayleaf, pepper and salt and stew all gently until done. Then remove all 
the meat from the bones, cut it into small pieces, egg and breadcrumb them and 
fry them in butter to a light brown." Serve the foot with a puree of tomatoes or 
mushrooms. 

Calf's Feet with Piquant Sauce. 

The same as for boiled calf's feet, using one-half pint of piquant sauce to pour 

ovetvjj iOO q^ 

Calf's Feet with Poulette Sauce. 

..;.-, 

Same as boiled calf's feet, adding one-half pint of poulette sauce, made as fol- 
lows : Put one pint of hot German sauce into a saucepan with one ounce of fresh 
butter, add the juice of one-half of a medium-sized lemon, and one teaspoonfui of 
chopped parsley. Heat thoroughly on a hot stove until well melted and mixed, but 
do not allow it to boil. Keep the sauce warm, and serve poured over the calf's feet 
on a dish. 

Braised Fillet of Veal. 

Choose a nice piece of fillet of veal, any part can be used ; put a good sized 
lump of butter in a saucepan to melt ; put in the veal and brown it on both sides. 
Pour clear broth or water over the veal, place the cover on, and steam over a clear 
fire, basting occasionally with its own liquor. Peel and slice a carrot and onion, and 
put them into a saucepan with a small quantity each of lemon peel, mace and thyme; 
pour in one-half pint of water and boil for twenty minutes. Strain the seasoned 
water over the veal, and continue cooking it. When the meat is tender, drain, place 
it on a hot dish and garnish with slices of lemon and crisped slices of bacon. Skim 
the fat off the cooking liquor, strain it through a fine hair sieve, and serve with the 
meat in a sauce tureen. 

Roasted Fillets of Veal with Fine Herbs. 

Lard the fillets with thin strips of bacon, place them in a deep dish with some 
finely-chopped mushrooms, shallots, chives, parsley, fennel, laurel leaves and thyme; 
sprinkle a small quantity of salt, pepper and grated nutmeg over them, cover them 
with olive oil and let soak for three hours. Drain the oil from the fillets, cover them 
with the mixed herbs, wrap them in thickly-buttered sheets of paper, fastening them 



VEAL. 243 

securely to keep the herbs in, and roast them in a good hot oven. When cooked 
take the paper off the fillets and scrape off the herbs. Put them in a saucepan with 
some gravy, a little lemon-juice and a lump of butter and boil it. Beat the yolk 
of an egg with a small piece of warmed butter, rub the fillets in this and then in 
grated breadcrumbs, giving them a good coating and brown them in a quick oven. 
When cooked, place the fillets on a folded napkin on a hot dish garnished with fried 
parsley, and serve them with sauce in a sauceboat. 

Fillet of Veal with Brain Fritters. 

Cut off a fillet from a leg of veal and rub it well over with the juice of a large 
mushroom, extracted by breaking it up and sprinkling salt over. If a little grated 
orange-peel and cayenne are added it will be improved. Dip the fillet in flour, 
brush over with egg, plunge it into boiling fat and fry it, or wrap it in oiled paper 
and grill it over a clear fire. Cut a calf's brain into equal-sized pieces, blanch and 
stew in stock for about fifteen minutes. Prepare a rather thick batter with the yolk 
of an egg, two ounces of flour, one-half tablespoonful of olive oil and warm butter; 
when ready, beat in the white of an egg whipped to a froth. Drain the pieces of 
brain, dip them into the batter, plunge into boiling fat, fry and drain them. Place 
the fillet on a dish, arrange the brain fritters and some fried slices of potato round, 
also sprigs of fried parsley, and serve with thick brown sauce in a sauceboat. 

Veal Fricadelles. 

Chop fine two pounds or more of lean veal and about three ounces of lean 
ham. Put one breakfast cupful of breadcrumbs in a saucepan with one-half pint of 
milk and stir it over the fire until cooked to a smooth paste, taking care that it does 
not burn at the bottom. Mix the bread with the chopped veal and ham, season the 
mixture with pepper, salt and the juice of half a lemon, and work it in with one- 
fourth pound of butter. When well mixed divide the mixture into small equal-sized 
portions, roll them into the balls, then dip them in beaten egg. Put one-fourth 
pound of butter into a fryingpan and when hot put in the balls and fry them until 
lightly browned. Great care must be taken not to burn them. Take the balls out 
of the fryingpan and stir into the butter three tablespoonfuls of flour. When a dark 
brown turn the flour into the saucepan, pour in by degrees one and one-half pints 
of stock, and when boiling put in the balls. Move the saucepan to the side of the 
fire and allow the contents to simmer slowly for an hour. Turn the fricadelles and 
gravy on to a hot dish garnished with slices of lemon or sippets of toast and croutons 
of fried bread, and serve. 

Fricandeau of Veal. 

Fricandeau of veal is properly made from the round muscle which is found on 
the innerside of the leg of veal, and is called the kernel, or cushion. To obtain it the 



244 VEAL. 

rest of the leg must be used for dishes which do not require special cuts. A thick 
cutlet is sometimes used as a fricandeau. Use a medium sized larding-needle and 
strips of fat salt pork cut less than a fourth of an inch square and two inches long; 
put the strips of pork or lardoons one by one into the split end of the needle and 
take a succession of stitches about one-fourth of an inch in length and depth in the 
upper surface of the veal in a line down the center, then make other lines of lardoons 
on both sides of the middle line, allowing the ends of the lardoons to come between 
each other, until the upper surface of the veal is thickly larded. After this is done 
it may be braised or baked. The fricandeau can be baked on a bed of vegetables, 
which may afterwards be rubbed through a sieve with a masher and form the basis of 
a brown gravy, or it may be garnished after cooking with green peas and spinach, or 
served with brown mushroom sauce. A larded fricandeau is a choice dish, even when 
it is made from a thick cutlet, if garnished with button mushrooms and truffles. When 
it is not desirable to use lardoons of pork, bacon strips of cold boiled tongue may 
replace them, or beef fat, if it be found sufficiently tough to permit it to be pulled 
through the rather dense fiber of uncooked meat. In larding veal the udder fat 
makes very passable lardoons. This fat is rather more substantial than that which 
lies about the kidneys, and which would crumble if drawn into uncooked meat. If 
the thin, fat membrane that is sometimes spread over spring lamb is cut into small 
squares it may be used in place of pork. 

Fricandeau of Veal with Puree of Sorrel. 

Cut a slice weighing about three pounds from a leg of veal, remove the sinews 
and lard the surface with fat bacon or pork, using a medium-sized larding-needle. 
Place it in a sautepan in which there are already pieces of pork skin, one sliced onion, 
one sliced carrot and a garnished bouquet. Season with one tablespoonful of salt, 
cover with buttered paper and let it color slightly for five minutes on the stove. 
Then moisten with one-half pint of white broth and cook for an hour. Serve with 
one-half pint of puree of sorrel on the dish, placing the veal on top. 

Grenadins of Veal, Chipolata. 

The same as for grenadins of veal with puree of green peas, only adding one pint 
of hot chipolata garnishing instead of the peas. 

Grenadins of Veal with Puree of Green Peas. 

Cut into half a dozen pieces two pounds of lean veal taken from the leg. 
Remove the sinews and lard the veal on one side, using a rather coarse needle for the 
purpose. Lay the pieces on a sautepan with one onion, one carrot and some scraps 
of pork, and let them brown together for six minutes. Season with one tablespoon- 
ful of salt, and moisten with one gill of white broth. Place the pan in the oven, 



VEAL. 245 

covering it with a piece of buttered paper ; at the end of thirty minutes, or when the 
contents are of a good color, remove it, and serve with one-half pint of hot puree of 
peas, spread on a dish, the grenadins on top, and the gravy strained and poured over 
all. 

Veal Ham. 

Trim a leg of veal to the shape of a ham. Mix well together one pint of bay 
salt, one pound of common salt, one or two ounces of saltpeter, one ounce of powdered 
cinnamon and one ounce of juniper berries, also powdered. Rub the meat well with 
this mixture, and place it on a tray with the skin downwards. Baste it well every 
day for about two weeks. At the end of that time hang the meat over wood smoke 
for a fortnight. Afterwards boil or partially boil, and then roast it. 

Haricot of Veal. 

Select four or five pounds of the best end of a neck of veal, cut or chop the bones 
short but do not cut up the veal, put it into a stewpan, cover it with brown gravy and 
let it simmer. Stew in another saucepan in some good stock six small cucumbers 
peeled and sliced, two cabbage lettuces well washed and cut in quarters, and one pint 
of green peas. When these are cooked and the veal nearly done put them into the 
stewpan with the veal and let all simmer together for ten minutes. Place the veal on 
a hot dish, arrange the eight pieces of lettuce and a few forcemeat balls round it, pour 
the gravy and the rest of the vegetables over, and serve. 

Hashed Veal. 

The remains of cold veal can be used and it is better if rather underdone. Cut 
the meat into thin slices, trimming off all the skin and gristle; slice a couple of onions 
and shallots, put them in a stewpan with a lump of butter, dredge them over lightly 
with flour and toss over the fire until they begin to brown. Pour in about three- 
fourths of a pint of clear broth, add a bunch of sweet herbs and boil gently for ten 
or fifteen minutes. Place the slices of veal in a clean stewpan, strain the gravy over 
them, put in one tablespoonful of finely-chopped parsley, the grated peel of half of a 
small lemon and a little grated nutmeg; season the whole with salt and pepper to 
taste. Let the hash simmer for five minutes close to the fire. Turn it out onto a 
hot dish, garnish with sippets of toast or croutons of fried bread, and serve. 

Boiled Calf's Head. 

Plunge a fine, fresh, white calf's head into hot water, leaving it for one minute, 
lift it out and sharply rub it all over with a rough towel in order to remove all remain- 
ing hairs. Carefully cut the flesh, beginning at the center of the head, right down to 
the nostrils. Then, with a very sharp knife, bone it from the top to the base on both 
sides. Place in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of flour, one gill of vinegar, one 



246 VEAL. 

medium-sized, well cleaned and sliced carrot, one sound peeled onion, eighteen or 
twenty whole peppers and two or three pinches of salt. Pour in very gradually two 
quarts of cold water, briskly stirring until all is added. Cut up half of the head into 
six equal pieces, add them to the broth, as also the other whole half, and let all cook 
together over a moderate fire for an hour and a half. Lift up the pieces and the half 
head and place the six pieces on a dry napkin. Have ready a hot dish with a folded 
napkin over it, tastefully dress the six pieces on it, decorate with parsley or greens, 
and serve with any desired sauce. Place the remaining half head in a stone jar, 
strain the broth over it and preserve it in a cool place for any purpose desired. 

Boiled Calf's Head with Vinaigrette Sauce. 

Proceed the same as for boiled calf's head, laying a folded napkin on the dish 
and fixing thereon the half of the head. Decorate with parsley leaves, and serve with 
one pint of vinaigrette sauce in a sauceboat. 

Braised Calf's Head. 

Clean and bone the head. Prepare a sufficient quantity of finely-chopped lean 
veal and fat bacon to stuff it. Season the stuffing with sweet herbs, salt and pepper, 
and bind it with the beaten yolks of three eggs. Stuff the head, sew it up securely to 
prevent the stuffing from oozing out and wrap it in a cloth. Line a braising pan with 
slices of veal and bacon; also a few slices of carrots; put in the head with a bunch of 
thyme and parsley and two bay leaves; season to taste with spice, and pour in one 
pint of broth and one-half pint of white wine. Stew the head for four hours. When 
cooked take it out of the cloth, put it on a hot dish and garnish with a financiere stew. 
Strain the cooking liquor of the head into a small clean stewpan, mix a wineglassful 
of Madeira wine with it; boil it a few minutes, then pour it over the head, and serve. 

Calfs Head, Financiere. 

For the preparation of this neat dish all the principal parts are prepared as for a 
stew the ears are scalded and stuffed, the brains formed into cakes. The pieces of 
meat are cut into large discs and arranged round a forcemeat loaf made of the trim- 
mings, and around this again, either on the same dish or upon one below it, the ears 
and brain-cakes are arranged with blanched olives and button mushrooms. Skewers 
garnished with cockscombs, truffles and various other things, surmount the whole. 

Hashed Calf's Head. 

Cut any desirable quantity of cold boiled calf's head into pieces about the size 
of a small apple. Put two or three ounces of butter into a saucepan to melt, mix in 
three tablespoonfuls of flour, and add one or two breakfast cupfuls of veal stock. 
When thoroughly incorporated add a few small mushrooms, salt and pepper to suit 



VEAL. 



247 



the taste, and boil well for ten minutes or so. Remove the saucepan to the side of the 
fire, add the hashed meat and allow it to get hot without boiling. Remove the pan 
from the fire, stir in the yolks of two eggs beaten up with the juice of a lemon and 
strained, and also add a little chopped parsley or tarragon. Turn the hash out onto 
a dish, and serve. 

Calf's Head in Tortue. 

Cut the meat of half a cold-boiled calf's head into small pieces. Mix one wine- 
glassful of sherry with one-half pint of well reduced stock, add to this the yolks of 
six hard boiled eggs and the whites cut into small pieces, three chopped gherkins, six 
quenelles of veal forcemeat, the pieces of head and a little cayenne pepper. Place 
the saucepan over the fire till the contents are hot. Pile the pieces of head in the 
middle of a hot dish, pour the sauce and eggs round it, garnish with croutons of fried 
bread, and serve. 

Calf's Head, Royal Style. 

This is considered by all epicures the very best of calf's head dishes. In the 
center of a silver dish is set a forcemeat loaf made from the fragments of the heads 
and necks used, scraps of veal, tongue and other things. About this are laid, over- 
lapping each other, discs of the meat off the head, and between these alternately 
a blanched cockscomb and three button mushrooms, diminishing in size upwards. 
The ears scored and stuffed with a truffle in each, are placed on the loaf with truffles 
between them, and fried bread wedge-shaped croutons are ranged round the loaf, with 
truffles set on the base of every crouton. A few sprigs of fried parsley are some- 
times added, and the whole is served with royal sauce. 

Stewed Calf's Head. 

After boning a calf's head, cut out the tongue and brains, and steep them with 
the meat in cold water for a few hours. Chop fine one-half pound of lean veal 
and one pound of beef suet and mix with them one breakfast cupful of grated bread- 
crumbs, the grated peel of one lemon, two or three tablespoonfuls of powdered herbs, 
and pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg in suitable quantities. Mix these ingredients 
well and bind them together with the beaten yolks of four or five eggs. Wash the 
head, dry it on a cloth, stuff it with some of the forcemeat and bind it round securely 
with tape. Place the head in a saucepan with a bunch of sweet herbs, two quarts of 
clear gravy, and one-half pint of white wine. Put the saucepan over the fire until the 
liquor boils, then move it to the side, cover it tightly, and keep the contents sim- 
mering until the head is tender. Boil the tongue in a small quantity of water, and, 
when cooked, drain and cut into thin slices. Chop the brains with a small quantity 
of parsley, dredge them with about one tablespoonful of flour, and season with finely- 
minced lemon-peel, salt, pepper and a small quantity of grated nutmeg; then mix in 
two well-beaten eggs. Shape the remainder of the forcemeat into small balls, put a 



248 VEAL. 

large lump of dripping into a fryingpan, make it hot, and fry the foremeat balls in it, 
also the brain mixture which should be dropped in with a spoon in small quantities. 
When fried drain the forcemeat balls and brain cakes on a wire sieve in front of a 
clear fire. When the head is cooked, remove the tapes and place it on a hot dish, 
strain the cooking liquor through a fine hair sieve, return it to the saucepan with one 
ounce of butter that has been mixed with two tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir it over 
the fire until thickened. More salt and pepper may now be added if required. 
Make the slices of tongue hot in the gravy, then pour it over the calf's head; garnish 
with slices of lemon the forcemeat balls and brain cakes, and serve while it is very 
hot. If there is too much liquor to go on the dish with the head, serve the remainder 
in a sauceboat. 

Veal in the Saucepan. 

Cut four pounds of veal about three inches thick off the fillet, roll it up, bind it 
round with tape, rub it over with flour, put it in a stewpan with a small lump of 
butter, and fry it until nicely browned all over. Pour one-half pint of rich gravy in 
with the veal, season it with salt and pepper, place the lid on the stewpan, and cook 
the contents slowly for four hours. When done, take the veal up, place it on a hot 
dish, first removing the tape, and keep it hot. Boil the cooking liquor quickly until 
stiffly reduced, then pour it over the meat and serve. 



Veal, Italian Style. 



Boil about one pint of milk with an onion and a bay leaf, for fifteen minutes ; 
then remove the bay leaf, and pour the boiling milk over a heaping breakfast cupful 
of breadcrumbs. Chop fine one pound of raw veal and pound it in a mortar, 
mixing with it a small quantity of cold, cooked fat ; then mix in the soaked crumbs, 
and pass the mixture through a coarse sieve. Divide it into equal portions, which 
mould into rolls with flour. Procure as many pieces of cloth as there are rolls, wring 
them out in boiling water, flour them, tie a roll in each, place them in a saucepan of 
boiling water, and boil from ten to fifteen minutes. When cooked, drain the rolls, 
remove the cloths, place them on a hot dish, pour some well-flavored brown sauce 
round them, and serve. 

Braised Kernel of Veal with Bechamel Sauce. 

Remove the udder and pare a cushion of veal, lard it interiorly with fillets of 
bacon, and season it with salt and pepper to taste. Line a bakingpan with trimmings 
of bacon and ham and some sliced vegetables ; put in the cushion with about one 
teacupful of broth, and place the cover on. Place some hot ashes on the lid, and 
braise it over a slow fire. Cut some mushrooms into slices, place them in a frying- 
pan with a lump of butter and fry until the moisture has reduced slightly. Season 
the mushrooms with pepper and salt, put them in one pint of reduced bechamel 



VEAL. 249 

sauce, and boil them for two or three minutes, then move them to the side. When 
the veal is done, remove it from the braisingpan and cut it up into thin slices. Line 
the bottom of a deep dish with the mushroom mixture, then arrange the slices of 
meat on it, putting them into shape again, alternating each layer with a small 
quantity of the mushroom mixture. Place the dish in the oven until the surface of 
its contents is nicely colored, then remove it, garnish with croquettes of potatoes, and 
serve. 

Kernel of Veal in Ballotines. 

Lard a cushion of veal with strips of bacon that have been well-seasoned with 
mixed spices, finely-chopped parsley, thyme and bay leaves, shallot, salt and pepper. 
Melt about one-half pound of butter in a stewpan, dredge the veal over with salt and 
pepper, put it in and stew over a slow fire. In forty-five minutes take the veal out of 
the pan and put it on a dish. Mix in with the butter four tablespoonfuls of grated 
bacon, one teacupful of pure olive oil, and a scant tablespoonful of chopped shallots. 
Fry these ingredients for a few minutes, then put in a dozen chopped mushrooms, one 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, and season with salt and pepper and a small 
quantity of grated nutmeg. When well done pour the mixture over the veal and 
leave until cold. Afterwards cover the meat with thin slices of bacon, and wrap it 
with all its seasoning in a sheet of paper; fold it up securely seeing that the seasoning 
cannot escape, and bind it round with tape. Place it on a gridiron and broil over a 
clear fire for an hour or so, turning it occasionally. Take care not to allow the paper 
to burn. When cooked, place the meat on a hot dish, and serve. 



Kernel of Veal, Jardiniere. 



Beat and trim a cushion of veal, and lard it with thin strips of fat becon two 
inches long. Put some slices of bacon and two sliced onions into a stewpan with two 
bay leaves, a few sprigs of parsley; add the cushion, pour over it one pint of white 
stock,' cover with the lid, and place it in a moderate oven for three hours. Baste the 
veal occasionally with its own liquor; if the moisture becomes absorbed, pour in a 
little more broth or some water. Peel eighteen young onions, the same number of 
carrots, and the same of young turnips; the two latter should be cut the shape of 
pears. Blanch the vegetables; put one ounce of butter into a sautepan with one 
tablespoonful of moist sugar, melt it, and then put in the onions; cover them with 
stock, and stew gently until tender. Cook the carrots and turnips in the same way, 
only in separate pans. The cooking stock of the vegetables should be reduced to a 
thin glaze by the time they are cooked. Peel and boil about four pounds of potatoes, 
drain them when soft, mash them with a small quantity of milk or butter, press them 
into a border mould, and stand it in a bain marie. Put the glaze from the vegetables 
into a sautepan with one quart of brown sauce and about one breakfast cupful of the 
gravy from the veal, first freeing it from fat. Boil the sauce until it becomes reduced 



250 VEAL. 

to rather a thick glace, skimming it frequently. When cooked, glaze the kernel or 
cushion and brown it under a salamander. Turn the border of potatoes onto a hot 
dish, arrange the glazed vegetables on the border, and place the noix in the center. 
Pour the sauce over the vegetables, and serve. 

Kernel of Veal, Sauted. 

Trim off the skin and cut a kernel of veal into small round pieces about one and 
one-half inches in diameter, beat and trim them neatly. Put one-fourth pound of 
butter into a sautepan, set it on a good fire, and when melted put in the pieces of 
meat with one or two tablespoonfuls of finely chopped parsley, toss until cooked, 
then place them on a hot dish. Pour one-half pint of well reduced veloute sauce 
into the pan with the butter, stir it over the fire until boiling, then move it to the 
side, and stir in the yolks of two eggs that have been well-beaten with two table- 
spoonfuls of cream. Pour the sauce over the meat, and serve. 

Broiled Veal Kidney, Maitre d'Hotel. 

Cut a veal Kidney in halves lengthwise, pound it lightly, sprinkle over a little 
salt and pepper, and dip each piece in butter that has been slightly warmed. Cover 
thickly the pieces of kidney with the butter and broil them over a clear fire, allowing 
about five minutes for each side. Place two ounces of butter in a basin, season it with 
chopped parsley, pepper and salt, squeeze in a little lemon juice and work it close to 
the fire until warm, though it must not be oiled. Put the maitre d'hotel butter on a 
dish, place the pieces of kidney over, and serve. 



Fried Veal Kidney. 



Remove the fat from several kidneys and cut them into rather thin slices; spray 
the slices with pepper and salt, plunge them into well-beaten egg and then into bread- 
crumbs and fry in a stewpan with a little butter until done. Put a mince of mush- 
rooms in the center of a dish, place the slices of kidney around, cover over with a few 
tablespoonfuls of Colbert sauce, and serve. 



Veal Kidney Fritter. 



Put four or five eggs into a basin, beat them well, add one teacupful of cream, a 
little finely-shred parsley, cloves and chopped mushrooms, seasoning with pounded 
mace, salt and pepper. Mince fine the required quantity of kidney, together with 
a little of the fat adhering to it, and stir this in with the egg mixture. Butter a.fry- 
ingpan and place it on the fire; when hot pour in the mixture and stir it until cooked, 
using care not to spread it out too thin. Remove the pan from the fire, brown che 
mixture with a salamander, or by holding the pan in front of the fire, and serve im- 
mediately. 



VEAL. 251 

Veal Kidney Stewed in Wine. 

Cut a veal kidney into several pieces, remove the sinewy parts and cut it in slices 
of moderate thickness. Put in a quarter of a pound of butter in a fryingpan to melt; 
then put in the slices of kidney, season with pepper and salt and fry them over a brisk 
fire until the moisture has disappeared. Put two tablespoonfuls of chopped shallot 
and onions into a stewpan with a lump of butter and fry them without browning; add 
fifteen or eighteen mushrooms, a bunch of parsley and a clove of garlic in with the 
onions. Pour in over the onions, etc., one-half pint of white wine and the same quan- 
tity of gravy. Boil the liquor till it is reduced to half its original quantity, then strain 
it through a fine hair-sieve into another saucepan; stir in with it a little thick brown 
sauce and a half teacupful of melted glaze, stir it over the fire for three or four min- 
utes, then throw in the slices of kidney and heat them without boiling. Take the 
garlic and bunch of parsley out of the liquor, place the kidney and sauce on a hot 
dish, garnish with croutons of fried bread or bits of toast, and serve. The slices of 
kidney may also be served in a fancy paste croustade. 

Braised Knuckle of Veal. 

Lard well a knuckle of veal weighing about three pounds; braise it in a pan with 
one ounce of fresh salt pork, one tablespoonful of salt and one teaspoonful oj: pepper. 
Cook for fifteen minutes, stirring now and then, and moistening with one-half pint 
each of Spanish sauce and white broth. Add one pint of raw jardiniere and one break- 
fast cupful of flageolets. Cook all together for forty-five minutes. Transfer the 
knuckle to a hot dish, pour the garnishing over, and serve very hot. 

Baked Leg of Veal with Cream Sauce. 

Place a small leg of veal in rather a deep baking dish; melt a lump of butter, 
pour it over the veal and roast it in a slack oven. Turn the meat now and then and 
baste it well. When nearly cooked sprinkle over with a little flour and salt, pour over 
it one-half pint of cream and finish cooking, basting from time to time and keeping 
the oven slack. When done drain the leg, place it on a hot dish and arrange a truffle 
round the knuckle-bone. Pour the cream into a small saucepan, mix a small quantity 
of melted glaze with it and boil until slightly reduced. Add two or three drops of 
vinegar, then pour the same over the meat, and serve.

juice, one pint of cream and one-half pint of oysters ; stir this over the fire until it 
thickens, let it boil for a few minutes, then pour over the veal ; garnish with oysters 
fried in butter and slices of toasted bacon. 

Calf's Liver. 

Those who are addicted to the eating of liver will appreciate that of the calf 
above all others. It should be cut into slices a half inch or so thick, and well 
washed, dried and floured before using. The flesh is close and dry when cooked, 
and therefore requires some qualifying material to be served with it, such as bacon. 

Liver and Bacon in Paper Cases. 

Boil some calf's liver until tender and cut it into slices. Open a sheet of com- 
mon note paper, and place on one-half of it a nicely trimmed rasher of bacon; have 
well mixed half an ounce of sifted breadcrumbs, and about one saltspoonful each of 
pepper, sifted herbs, chopped parsley, salt, and very finely-chopped onion ; sprinkle 
nearly one teaspoonful of this seasoning over the rasher of bacon, lay it on a slice of 
the liver, sprinkle this also with about a teaspoonful of the seasoning, lay on top an- 
other nicely-trimmed thin rasher, fold the other half of the paper over, turn up the 
edges of the paper at the three open sides, and fry for quarter of an hour, turning 
once. Serve while it is very hot. 

Braised Calf's Liver. 

Remove the skin, gall and spleen from a very white calf's liver, lard it with some 
well-seasoned fillets of ham and fat bacon, the larding to be done in such a way that 
the fillets do not cross the top surface. Put the liver in a basin with some trimmings 
of truffles, a bay leaf, a few sprigs of parsley and thyme and a little salt and spices. 
Let it remain in this for two hours, then wrap the liver and seasonings up in a large 
piece of pig's caul, and tie it securely with tape. Place a- good-sized lump of lard in 
a stewpan, and when boiling put the liver in, fry it for about fifteen minutes, then put 
the lid on the stewpan with some live embers on the top, move the stewpan to the side 
of the fire, and braise the liver for one hour, turning it frequently. Peel and scald two 
dozen small onions and two dozen small carrots, put them in with the liver, the onions 
on one side and the carrots on the other, sprinkle in a little salt, place the lid on the 
stewpan again, with a fresh supply of live embers on the top, and finish cooking by 
the side of a moderate fire for another hour. Remove the liver, drain it, put it in a hot 
dish, and arrange the vegetables neatly round it. Skim the fat off the cooking liquor, 
mix with it one wineglassful of white wine and a little gravy, boil quickly till it is 
reduced one-half, then mix with it a small quantity of brown sauce and stir over the 
fire a few minutes longer. Sprinkle in a little pepper and salt, strain the sauce, pour 
it over the liver, and serve.

onions, put in the veal with a bunch of sweet herbs and two bay leaves, and pour 
in two breakfast cupfuls of clear broth, Place the stewpan in a moderate oven, 
and cook the contents for three hours, basting the meat occasionally with some of 
its own cooking liquor. Should all the moisture become absorbed, a small quantity 
of water may be added. When cooked take the veal out of the stewpan, glaze it 
and brown it lightly with a salamander. Lay it on a hot dish, and keep it hot 
while the sauce is being prepared. Strain the cooking gravy through a fine hair 
sieve into a small saucepan, season it with pepper, and boil it up. Then pour the 
gravy over the kernel, and serve.

How to Prepare Sweetbreads. 

Leave a dozen sweetbreads in cold water for two hours to disgorge, then change 
the water and boil them for a few moments on a hot fire ; take them off and refresh 
in cold water ; cut away all the windpipes and fibrous nerves and then prepare them 
as required in the various recipes. 

Aiguillettes of Sweetbreads. 

Boil a sufficient number of throat sweetbreads in water for ten minutes. Pour off 
the water and add some onion, carrot and turnip, all sliced, bay leaves, and enough 
stock or broth. Let all simmer for twenty minutes, until the sweetbreads are quite 
firm; then take out and lay on a clean cloth. Cut them into pieces about the size of 
a quarter, with a long, round cutter, and season with pepper and salt. Then chop 
some shallots very fine, and fry them in a stewpan with a little butter until they are 
quite white; add some white sauce and a little white stock. Reduce it slowly until 
thickish, when the yolks of some eggs may be beaten in and the juice of some lemon. 



VEAL. 265 

Do not let it boil after the yolks are added, but remove to one side of the stove. 
Dip the pieces of sweetbread into the sauce, and lay them on a dish until they are 
cold. Run the skewers through the centers of the pieces, two on a skewer. Put 
plenty of egg and breadcrumb on them and fry in hot lard, serving very hot on a 
folded napkin or dish-paper. 

Attereaux of Sweetbreads. 

Boil two large sweetbreads until they are done; let them cool and divide them 
into slices. Sprinkle over them a little salt and pepper, and arrange them round the 
bottom of a sautepan in which some butter has been spread. Fry over a sharp fire; 
take them out and place them on a slab to cool, with a light weight on top to make 
them flat. When these slices are quite cold, cut them round with a cutter, and put 
them into a basin with an equal quantity of similar rounds of boiled tongues and 
mushrooms, all cut with the same cutter so as to be exactly the same size as the 
rounds of sweetbreads. Pour over them in the basin a little well reduced brown sauce, 
roll them in this sauce, and then string them alternately on little wooden skewers. 
Have ready some villeroy sauce, made by beating some yolks of eggs up in a mortar 
with butter divided into little pieces; add this to the usual white sauce, reduced and 
made consistent, and boil up. Dip the attereaux in the sauce made at the same time 
as they are preparing, and arrange them on a baking sheet, at a little distance from 
each other to let the sauce cool. Then take them out, one by one, trim off the super- 
fluous sauce, and roll them in breadcrumbs; dip into beaten egg, and again roll in 
breadcrumbs; then plunge them into boiling fat until of a good color. Drain, remove 
the wooden skewer, place them on ornamental metal attelettes, and dish on a folded 
napkin. No sauce is required in serving these. 

Braised Sweetbreads. 

Take six blanched heart sweetbreads, lard the upper parts slightly, and place 
them in a braisingpan with some slices of fat pork; add half of a sliced carrot, half of 
a sliced onion, and a garnished bunch of parsley. Sprinkle with a little salt, and 
cover with buttered paper. Cook them to a golden color on the fire, and moisten 
with one-half pint of strong white broth; place the pan in the oven, and bake the 
sweetbreads for forty minutes, basting occasionally with the gravy, lifting the buttered 
paper, and replacing it each time in the same position. The sweetbreads will now be 
ready to serve with any kind of sauce that may be desired.

bubbles add one pint of cream, the chopped mixture, and stir all together thoroughly 
until well heated. Remove from the fire, add the juice of half a lemon and set on 
one side to cool. Roll the mixture into shapes and dip them into beaten eggs and 
then into fine cracker-crumbs. Let the croquettes stand until dry, dip them again in 
egg and finally in breadcrumbs. All the crumbs should first be salted and peppered. 
Fry quickly in boiling fat and serve.

pour in one teacupful of clear broth and reduce that also to a glaze. When well 
glazed put the sweetbreads on a dish and keep them hot while the following garnish 
is being prepared. Pour one-half pint of wine in the stewpan that the sweetbreads 
were cooked in, and when boiling strain the wine through a fine hair sieve, skim off 
the fat and boil it until reduced to half its original quantity. Peel four or five raw 
truffles, cut them in quarters, place them in the wine with one teacupful of brown 
sauce, and boil for five minutes. Put eighteen or twenty button mushrooms in the

Sweetbread in White Sauce. 

Put a sweetbread in a bowl and cover it with cold water, and let it steep for an 
hour or two. Drain the sweetbread, put it into a saucepan with sufficient cold water 
to cover, and stand it over the fire. When the water boils move the saucepan a little 
off the fire so that the sweetbread may cook slowly for about thirty minutes. At the 
end of that time plunge the sweetbread into a basin of cold water, then drain it, 
trim off the fat, and cut it into small pieces. Put one-third of a tablespoonful of 
arrowroot into a basin, and mix it smoothly with one breakfast cupful of milk ; turn 
it into the saucepan, stir over the fire until it boils, then put in the sweetbread, and 
season to taste with pepper and salt, and simmer it gently at the edge of the fire for

onions, carrots and turnips in a stewpan with some thin rashers of bacon, put in the 
sweetbreads, season with a little salt, and pour in some good broth to about three- 
fourths their height. Place a sheet of buttered paper over the sweetbreads, and boil 
them gently till the liquor is reduced to one-third, then place the lid on the stewpan 
with some hot ashes on it and finish cooking them. Ornament a border mould with 
some truffles, fill it with veal forcemeat and poach it in the bain-marie. When cooked 
turn the border of forcemeat onto a hot dish, place a piece of fried bread in the 
center masked with forcemeat, and fill up the hollow with cooked sliced truffles and 
mushrooms. Brush the sweetbreads over with melted glaze, and stand them on the 
border resting them on the block of bread. Place three button-mushrooms and a 
truffle between each sweetbread, garnish an attelette skewer with a truffle and a cocks- 
comb, and fix it in the top of the bread support ; pour round the dish a small quantity 
of brown sauce that has been reduced in a little white wine, trimmings of mushrooms 
and truffles. Serve the sweetbread with a sauceboatful of the same sauce.

and lined with a rich puff paste, fill them with the sweetbread mixture, cover with 
more of the paste, brush over the top with a well beaten egg, put them into a mod- 
erate oven, and bake for twenty or twenty-five minutes ; then remove, and serve with- 
out delay. 

Sweetbread Pie, Financiere. 

Butter a pie mould and line it with short paste. Mix some sweet herbs with a 
sufficient quantity of raw chicken forcemeat and put a layer of it at the bottom; fill 
the pie with collops of calf's or lamb's sweetbreads that have been fried with herbs, 
put in another layer of the forcemeat, lay a flat of paste on the top, moisten the edges 
and press them together, trimming round evenly; brush the top over with a paste 
brush dipped in beaten egg, cover with a sheet of paper and bake for an hour and a 
quarter in a moderate oven. Shape out of some veal forcemeat fifteen quenelles and 
poach them in salted water. Lard a lamb's sweetbread, braise and glaze it with some 
fowls' livers, truffles, cockscombs and button mushrooms. Prepare a garnishing. 
When cooked take the pie out of the oven, take off the top round of paste and the 
top layer of forcemeat, slip the pie onto a hot dish and pour into it some brown 
sauce that has been reduced with a little Madeira. Arrange the garnishing in the 
center, placing the sweetbread on the top, put the quenelles on the rim, and serve the 
pie while hot with a sauceboatful of Madeira sauce. 

Sweetbreads, Piedmontese. 

Boil two or three sweetbreads, drain and let them get cold, then cut them into 
slices broadwise. Season the slices of sweetbread, place them in a sautepan with 
some clarified butter and fry until they are slightly browned on both sides. Drain 
the butter off the sweetbreads, pour in a little white wine and boil it till reduced; add 
a small quantity of white sauce, keep the pan over the fire for a few minutes, then 
put in ten or a dozen thinly sliced raw truffles; move the saucepan to the side of the 
fire and keep it covered. Boil three-fourths of a pound of well-washed rice, turn it

breads, and serve. 

Sweetbread Vol-au-Vent, Financiere. 

Prepare one pound of puff paste and roll it out to about two and one-half inches 
in thickness. Cut a round out of the paste with a tin cutter, brush the round over 
with a paste brush dipped in beaten egg without touching the sides, and with a knife, 
the point being held inwards towards the center, make a circular incision pressing 
the inner paste to prevent its closing up again. Make a lid with some of the remain- 
ing paste to fit in the wall of the vol-au-vent, brush the top over with beaten egg, 
place the paste on a baking-sheet and bake for half an hour in a moderate oven. Put 
one ounce of butter and a tablespoonful of flour in a stewpan, stir it over the fire until 
well mixed, then pour in gradually one pint of stock and keep stirring over the fire 
until boiling. Put one wineglassful of sherry, two tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketch- 
up and a little cayenne pepper in the sauce, move it to the side of the fire and let 
it simmer gently for fifteen minutes for the purpose of clarifying it; then skim it, put 
in a piece of glaze, put it on the fire and let it boil quickly for five minutes longer. 
When the glaze has dissolved, strain the sauce through a fine hair-sieve into another 
saucepan, put in it two partially-boiled calf's sweetbreads, three or four cockscombs, 
a few truffles and mushrooms, all cut up into fairly small pieces. Boil the sauce 
gently until the sweetbreads, etc., are cooked, then season to suit the taste with pep- 
per and salt. When cooked take the vol-au-vent out of the oven, remove the center 
carefully without damaging the case, put the above mixture into it and then cover 
with the lid. Place the vol-au-vent on a folded napkin on a hot dish and serve while 
very hot. If the cases are made and cooked before the mixture with which to fill 
them is ready, they can always be placed in an oven and warmed again. 



274 VEAL. 

Sweetbreads, Waldorf. 

Disgorge some sweetbreads in cold water for one hour, change the water and 
boil them over a slow fire for half an hour, then refresh and lay them under a weight 
for another half hour; remove and lard with small fat pork lardings. Line the bottom 
of a saucepan with the fragments of fat pork, parsley roots, a slice or two of carrot 
and a minced onion; add a little white broth and the sweetbreads, and leave to 
simmer for half an hour. Dress them onto artichoke bottoms, laid on a dish, half a 
sweetbread on each, and serve with a brown sauce containing chopped truffles and 
small chicken quenelles. 

Sweetbreads with Black Butter. 

Boil the sweetbreads, and then press them between two plates until cold. Cut 
them into thin slices, and rub them in plenty of flour. Put one and one-half pounds 
of butter into a fryingpan, and stir it over the fire until frothy and brown, then put in 
the sweetbreads, and brown on both sides. When cooked place the sweetbreads on a 
hot dish, garnish with a few olives and slices of lemon, put a little of the browned 
butter over, and serve. 

Sweetbreads with Mushrooms. 

Boil the sweetbreads for twenty or twenty-five minutes, then cut them into small 
pieces, place them in a saucepan with an equal amount of chopped mushrooms, cover 
with a cream sauce and boil them for a few minutes. Turn the mixture onto a hot 
dish, garnish with croutons of fried bread, and serve. 

Curried Tendons of Veal. 

Cut the tendons into equal-sized pieces, and braise them. When cooked, drain 
the tendons and press them between two plates till nearly cold. Strain the cooking 
liquor into another saucepan. Mix two tablespoonfuls of curry powder with two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, mixing them to a paste with a little water, then pour it in the 
strained liquor, and stir well over the fire until boiling. Trim the tendons neatly, 
put them in the curry, and boil gently for fifteen minutes. Put some slices of fat 
bacon on a dish, put the tendons on them, pour over the curry, and serve with a dish 
of plain boiled rice. 

Timbales of Veal. 

Trim off all the skin from a fillet of veal, cut the meat into small pieces, place 
them in a mortar and pound them. Put half a dozen chicken's livers in a fryingpan 
with some fat bacon, to fry. Drain the livers, pound them, mix them with the 
pounded veal, season with mixed spices, pepper and salt, and pass it through a fine 



VEAL. 275 

hair sieve; then mix with it five tablespoonfuls of rather coarsely chopped cooked 
ham. Butter some small moulds, line them with a rich puff paste, and fill them 
with the mixture. Bake for about forty-five mmutes in a moderate oven, then 
remove, and level the contents off to the same height as the moulds. Take the 
timbales out of the moulds, pour a little thick sauce in them, cover with some lids of 
puff paste that have been baked by themselves, arrange them on a hot dish covered 
with a folded napkin, and serve at once. 

Stewed CalPs Tongue and Brains. 

Place in hot water a boiled calf's tongue and a cooked brain, keeping the brain 
as whole as possible, and get them hot. Make a brown gravy by stirring one table- 
spoonful each of butter and flour over the fire until light brown, and then slowly stir 
in one pint of boiling water; season with one teaspoonful of salt, and- pinch or two of 
pepper, and one gill of vinegar; lay the tongue and brain on a hot dish, pour the 
gravy over, and serve at once. Or serve them with a hot sauce made by mixing with 
a breakfast cupful of mayonnaise, one saltspoonful of dry mustard, one tablespoonful 
each of chopped parsley, capers and pickles, and one teaspoonful of grated onion. 

Calf's Tongue with Tomato Sauce. 

Trim and well wash a calf's tongue, place it in a saucepan of boiling water, and 
scald. Remove, drain and lard, put it into a saucepan with two carrots and two or 
three onions, three heads of cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs, and sufficient rich 
stock to moisten. Allow it to simmer gently for four hours. Take out the tongue 
when done, and slice it in halves, removing the skin; put them on a dish, and serve 
with tomato sauce poured over. 



Poultry. 



Capons. 

The instructions for preparing capons for cooking are as follows: 
FOR CLEANING AND TRUSSING : Pluck off all the feathers and singe a capon, chop 
off the head close to the back, remove the crop, and loosen the liver and other inside 
parts to the breast end. Cut around the vent, draw it clean, flatten the breast-bone 
with a cutlet bat, cut off the toenails and tuck the feet down close to the legs. 

FOR BOILING Put the forefinger through the interior, under the skin of the legs, 
raise it, make holes in them, and push in the legs. Pass a skewer into the first joint 
of the pinion, bringthe middle of the leg close to it; push a skewer through the middle 
of the leg into the body, and repeat this operation on the other side. Place the liver 
and gizzard in the pinions, turn the ends or points on the back, and fasten the legs 
into position by tieing them with a string. 

Boiled Capon. 

Draw a fat capon, be careful not to remove the fat from the rump; peel about 
one-half pound of truffles, boil them in a little Madeira; take the trimmings of the 
truffles and pound them with an equal amount of breadcrumbs, add half a goose's fat 
liver, the whites of two eggs, and a few tablespoonfuls of scraped bacon; rub through 
a sieve. Truss the capon with its legs forced under the skin, rub it with lemon, and 
tie on it thin slices of bacon fat: put it in a pan with some slices of vegetables and 
bacon. Place in sufficient white broth to cover, and over all a piece of buttered 
paper, and boil gently. When cooked drain and take off the string. Put a layer of 
the forcemeat on a dish, put the capon over and garnish both sides with white cocks- 
combs. 

Boiled Barded Capon with Mushrooms. 

Take a young capon, singe and draw it, fill it within with bread-stuffing of veal 
or forcemeat, with the stems of some chopped mushrooms added. Put a slice of fat 
bacon on the breast, score a little and tie it on. Put it in a stewpan with enough 
unskimmed broth to cover it, add spices and aromatics to flavor. Place the pan on a 
slow fire, broil one hour. When it is cooked take it from the pan, skim off the fat 
from the stock, and make a little white sauce reduced with the liquor, in which a few 
mushrooms have been boiled. Add the yolks of two eggs to thicken it. When 
ready to serve, remove the string and bacon.

Braised Capon. 

Take a capon, draw and truss it, put it into a braisingpan with half a pound of fat 
bacon, sliced; add one tablespoonful of butter and a pint of veal broth. Place it on 
a brisk fire, which will give the capon a brown color. Then remove it to a moderate 
fire, and put some hot coals or embers on the top, and braise the capon for an hour. 
Skim off the fat from the liquor, add half a pint of good stock, reduce it to a half- 
glaze, strain and pour over the capon. Capons may be stuffed with truffles, chest- 
nuts, sausages, olives, or plain veal stuffing. 

Braised Capon, Chipolata Style. 

Choose a fine young capon, draw and singe it, and truss as if for boiling. Peel 
a lemon, slice it, lay the slices on the capon, and support them with thin layers of 
bacon fat. Tie them up, and put the capon into a stewpan spread with vegetables 
and trimmings of fat. Allow it to cook for a few minutes, and add ten or twelve 
ounces of pickled pork. Then pour in sufficient good broth and white wine to cover 
one-half the height of the capon. Boil it up and put the capon on a moderate fire, 
so that it will braise slowly. It will be necessary to turn it several times, and will 
require about an hour and a quarter to cook thoroughly. When done, remove the 
pan from the fire, and twenty minutes before serving put about twenty small chipolata 
sausages, or one large common sausage (not too thick), into the pan. Chipolata 
sausages are made of poultry meat, bacon, and bread-pulp. When ready take out 
the capon, strain through a sieve the cooking stock, remove the fat, and reduce it to 
half-glaze, adding a few tablespoonfuls of good brown sauce and two or three dozen 
fresh mushrooms. When it is sufficiently reduced add the sausages, the pork cut 
into squares, twenty-four cooked chestnuts, and the same number of small glazed 
onions. Place the capon on a dish, garnish with onions, sausages, etc., and serve 
with the sauce. 

Braised Capon, Financiere. 

Take one capon; pluck, singe and draw it, remove the forked part of the breast- 
bone, fill the crop skin with butter seasoned with pepper and salt, and truss the capon 
in the same way you would for roasting. Lard the breast with strips of bacon fat, 
and tie some slices of fat bacon over the remainder of the capon; that is, the parts not 
larded. Put it into the braisingpan with a sufficient quantity of good stock to come 
above the pinions, then lay a round of buttered paper over the capon, cover over the 
pan, and let it simmer for an hour. Remove the paper and glaze the parts that are 
larded. Then make a ragout of foies gras, cut in scallops, mushrooms, and some 
small chicken quenelles mixed in financiere sauce, and put it on a dish round a block 
of fried bread, made by cutting the crumb of bread in the shape of a block eight 
inches in height, six inches square at the base, and three and one-half inches square 



2 ;8 POULTRY. 

at the top; fry this in some boiling fat, let it drain, and it is then ready for use. It 
can be fixed to the dish with a little paste made of egg and flour. Arrange the capon 
with its crop downward, and place two geese's fat livers, studded with small truffles, 
between them on the other two sides of the bread. Range a crayfish on either side 
of the geese's fat livers, and cockscomb on the top. Put a larded sweetbread on 
the top of the bread support, then garnish three silver skewers with cockscombs, 
crayfish and mushrooms, in the order named, and thrust them into the capon and 
sweetbreads. Put some financiere sauce in a sauceboat, and serve. 

Braised Capon, Godard Style. 

Prepare and cook one capon as for braised capons, financiere, but do not lard 
the breasts. Then make a stew of cockscombs, truffles and mushrooms moistened with 
Godard sauce. Prepare a dish with a bread support and croutons of fried bread round 
the edge; pour in the stew and garnish with cockscomb, truffles, some larded sweet- 
breads, and a large quenelle ornamented with truffles and tongues in the following 
order: a larded sweetbread on each of the sides and one on the top of the bread and 
a quenelle on top of the two sweetbreads; put that on the dish by the side of the 
bread; place a truffle on the top of each quenelle and one on each side of the 
sweetbreads, leaving a little space between and a cockscomb in the space left 
between the sweetbreads and the truffles and one at the base of the capon. Then 
take a silver skewer and put two cockscombs and a truffle on it and thrust it into 
the bread support between the legs of the capon. Serve some Godard sauce separately 
in a sauceboat. 

Braised Capon with Sweetbread and Truffles. 

Prepare and truss a capon as for capons, financiere. Then make a stew of 
chicken quenelles and cut mushrooms mixed in a Regence sauce. When the capon is 
done, drain and place it on a dish and lean it against a block of fried bread with the 
crop downwards. Then place one braised sweetbread below the capon and one on 
the top of the bread. Put a crayfish on each side of the sweetbread except the 
sweetbread on the top and a truffle on each crayfish. Serve with some Regence sauce 
in a sauceboat. 

Capon Pie. 

Separate the flesh from the bones of a cold roasted capon and cut it into slices 
with the exception of the thighs and pinions, which should be left whole. Remove the 
skin from and boil about one-half pound of chestnuts, chop fine in equal quantities 
some thyme, sweet marjoram and pennyroyal; line a pastrypan with paste, put in it 
the thighs and pinions and strew over them a quantity of minced onions; then put in 
flesh of the bird with four sweetbreads and half a dozen oysters cut in halves, season 



POULTRY. 279 

them with sweet herbs, salt, cloves, grated nutmeg and a bit of mace ; cover with the chest- 
nuts and put a few small pieces of butter over. Close the pan and bake the pasty in 
a quick oven. Meanwhile prepare a sauce with gravy, stock, drawn butter, two or 
three boned and filleted anchovies and a small quantity of grated nutmeg. When 
cooked, garnish the pasty with slices of lemon, pour the sauce over it, and serve. 

Roasted Capons. 

Cut off the first joint of the pinions, beat the breastbone flat with a rolling pin, 
push a skewer through the pinion bringing the middle of the legs close, pass a skewer 
through the legs, body, and remaining pinion, twist the neck, and fasten the head on 
the skewer the bill pointing forwards ; pass another skewer through the sides, and 
fasten the legs close on either side. Run a skewer through all, and the capon is 
ready for cooking. 

Roasted Capons with Noodles. 

Prepare a capon, as for braised capons, financiere, covering the breast with 
slices of bacon-fat instead of larding them. Wrap some brown paper round the 
capon, and roast it before a good fire. When it is done move it from the spit, and 
take off the bacon, Moisten some noodles with German sauce, and add to this some 
Parmesan cheese and chicken glaze. Place the noodles on a dish two inches in thick- 
ness, put the capon on them, and serve with German sauce. 

Stewed Capon, French Style. 

Pluck, singe and draw a capon, wipe it thoroughly both inside and out, rub it 
well with lemon and truss ; tie some slices of bacon fat over, put it into a saucepan 
with an onion cut in slices, pour over one breakfast cupful of good stock or gravy, 
and stew gently on the side of the fire until the bird is done. Place it on a dish, and 
serve. 

Instructions for Cleaning a Chicken. 

Lay the bird on its back with its tail toward you, cut a circle around the vent to 
free the bowels, then turn the chicken about so that the breast is toward you and the 
head and neck hanging over the edge of the table. Open the neck at the back, cut- 
ting lengthwise along the bone, and when this incision is long enough draw the 
skinned neck in a loop through the incision. Chop off the neck at the base and then 
cut through the skin of the neck across the slit so as to leave a flap about two inches 
long. Next insert the fingers through the opening in the neck and draw out the 
entrails, taking every care not to break them. If they should be burst by any acci- 
dent the interior of the carcass must be washed out and dried. If the entrails are 
sound the inside may be dried by wiping out with a cloth. Singe the chicken and 



280 POULTRY. 

the legs especially until the skin will peel off by drawing a cloth along them. Shorten 
the toes and spurs by clipping them and the bird is then ready for trussing. Some 
cooks cut off the feet just below the joint where the feathered legs commence; for 
boiling it is well to do this, but for roasting it is not necessary. 

If the poulterer cleans the bird it may be cut up for an entree as follows: Split 
the chicken into halves lengthwise by cutting down the middle of the back with a 
sharp knife, laying the fowl wide open and chopping through the breast bone from 
the inside. Lay one-half on the board and chop slantingly through the end of the 
drumstick at the hip joint or a little on the fleshy side of it; next cut off the side 
bone and tail end, leaving as much meat as possible on the body a little of which 
may be taken from the thigh. Cut off the second joint by chopping straight across 
the chicken, thereby dividing the quarters into three pieces of equal weight. Cut off 
the two small joints of the wing; chop off the main joint slantwise so that it will have 
attached to it a piece of the neckbone and a small part of the flesh of the breast. 
There will then remain nearly the entire breast, which should be chopped straight 
across to make two pieces. Cut up the other half of the fowl in the same way. The 
object of cutting up a fowl in this way is to provide for each person a piece of meat 
of equal size and appearance. Treated otherwise one would have all meat and another 
a dark-looking, bare piece of bone. 

Boning a Chicken. 

Break the bones of the bird just above the feet by giving them a blow with a 
knife, cut the skin round and give the feet a twist, thus breaking them off and with 
them the strong sinews of the legs. Chop off the wings just above the second joint. 
Slit the skin of the neck and pull it out, cut it off close and trim the skin neatly. 
Make an incision along the back from the neck to the tail, then separate the flesh 
from the bones beginning at the neck end. When the wing bone is reached disjoint 
it from the carcass, make a slit along the inside of the wing and remove the bone, 
then disjoint the thigh bone from the carcass. Proceed the same with the other 
side. Work along each side, detaching the breast and being very careful not to 
break the skin, especially over the breast, where it is very tender; then remove the 
carcass; make an incision along the thigh, dissect the bone from the flesh, scrape 
the flesh of the leg along the bone and then pull it out in such a way as to draw out 
the remaining sinews with it. 

If very old and tough the chicken may be made tender in the following 
manner* Cut it up into joints; put these into a deep pan with sufficient slightly 
salted water to cover; set the pan in the oven and let it remain until the bones 
can be easily pulled out. It will require three or four hours for this. As the 
water boils away more boiling water must be added so as to have the meat always 
covered. Now draw out all the bones, remove the skin and sinews, and the flesh 
will be quite tender and fit for using in stews, curries or such like dishes.

Trussing Chickens, Fowls, Turkeys, Etc. 

Turkeys and fowls are trussed in the same way, so that what is said of one will do 
for the other. As there is a good deal to say on this subject it will be well to observe 
that when drawn according to the directions given under- their respective headings the 
free use of the flour-mop or dredger is an absolute necessity, otherwise the bird will 
have a most revolting appearance, being besmeared with blood and other discoloring 
substances from the inside, and would be anything but attractive or appetizing. 

The first thing to do with a fowl is to clean or "draw" it. When you have done 
this single it, chop off the toes of the claws, leaving about one-fourth of an inch, and 
serve the spurs in the same way; then chop off the pointed tips of the pinions and 
turn the wings in so as to make triangles on the back of the bird, the tips being pushed 
over the first joints. 

Let it be said here, once for all, that the practice of fixing the gizzard and liver 
into the wings has long since been done away with, both being useful for other pur- 
poses, but spoiled by roasting or baking. 

Having arranged the wings, lay the fowl on its back, and so that it will be on its 
folded wings also; then grip both thighs with one hand, and with a long packing nee- 
dle threaded with twine (white in preference), pierce through the thighs and body in 
the bend of the joint. Draw the string through and push the needle under the joint 
of the wing nearest the leg alongside of it, then cut through the middle of the chick 
part, taking a stitch through the flap of the neck, drawn tightly down, stitching it on- 
to the back, then through the opposite pinion. Press the leg into an even position 
and square the fowl nicely before you; when it is evenly and neatly shaped, tie the 
ends of the string fairly tight, That done press the leg down and pass the needle 
through the leg and body to the other side; draw it tightly and return through the 
flesh over the outside of the backbone, through again to the joint where the two ends 
are tied. Finally, cut a small slit in the apron just above the vent and force the cush- 
ion of the tail through this hole so that it remain in the bird out of sight. When 
fowls are stuffed the stuffing is pushed through the hole where the vent was before the 
tail was tucked in, and thrust clear up to the breast, filling it out like a crop. Should 
there be any difficulty in making the vent keep in its place, a small skewer must be 
used. 

Some cooks cut the feet off at the ankle joints; that is, where the scaly part joins 
the feathers, and this practice is a good one; but when it is decided to leave the legs 
on they must be singed or rather burnt until the outer skin can be stripped off by 
drawing a cloth firmly along it. Take care to see that both the knots of the trussing- 
twine are on the same side of the bird, as they are more easily removed after cooking. 

Pheasants, pigeons and partridges can be trussed for roasting in a similar manner 
to that described above. 

Fowls and turkeys for broiling or braising require a somewhat different manner 



282 POULTRY. 

of trussing. Make an incision in the leg down to the bone, then insert the ringers in 
the vent and loosen the skin from the flesh all round the thigh. When the limb is 
thoroughly loosened from the skin lift the cut edge nearest the body of the bird, and, 
folding the limb, thrust it under the skin until it can be seen. The strings are then 
fastened over the feet. 

The great difficulty about this latter method of trussing is to get the legs well 
under the skin without breaking it. The insufficient loosening of the skin is generally 
the prime cause of the trouble. 

Geese and ducks are trussed by turning the wings under and fastening the legs 
close to the sides by skewers. When, as is sometimes the case, the feet of the duck 
are left on, the joint is severed and the toes cut off, and the feet scalded and peeled; 
the bird is then trussed in the usual manner. The feet are tied under the back against 
the points of the wings. 

Chicken, Bechamel Sauce. 

Put into a large saucepan two onions cut in quarters with one ounce of butter 
and fry for a few minutes. Cut about a pound and a half or two pounds of fillet of 
veal into small pieces and put these in with the onions, also two chickens from which 
the fillets have been removed, seasoning them with salt and pepper; fry the meats for 
a few minutes, then dredge in half a pound of flour, stir it over the fire and pour in 
gradually three quarts of stock, add a bunch of sweet herbs and continue stirring 
until it boils. Move the stewpan to the side of the fire, put on the lid and let 
the contents simmer for two hours. The fat should be skimmed off frequently. 
Strain the sauce through a fine hair sieve into another stewpan and boil it quickly, 
adding a pint of thick cream in three separate portions. When the sauce is reduced 
to such a consistency that it coats the spoon, strain it through a broth napkin into a 
basin, and stir it until cold. 

Boiled Chicken. 

Put one quart of broth into a stewpan over the stove, and when it boils put in a 
cleaned and trussed fowl or chicken and season with an onion, a bunch of sweet herbs 
and a little salt and pepper. When the fowl is done, dish it up, garnish with pieces 
of fried bacon, and serve with white sauce. 

Boiled Chickens, Providence Style. 

Singe, draw and wipe two chickens, truss them from the wing to the leg with a 
needle, and boil them in a saucepan of broth for three-quarters of an hour. Prepare 
one pint of allemande sauce with the broth of a chicken, adding one teacupful each of 
finely cut boiled carrot and cooked lima beans or flageolets, and cook for three 
minutes longer. Dish up the fowls, untruss, pour over the sauce, arrange the vege- 
tables on either side, and serve with chopped parsley sprinkled over. 



POULTRY. 283 

Boiled Chickens, Royal Style. 

Truss two chickens as for boiling, lard their breasts thoroughly and place them 
in a stewpan with stock up to the larding; then cover them over with a piece of 
buttered paper, put a tight-fitting lid on the pan and let them gently simmer until 
done. While they are cooking, cut a croustade of bread in the shape of a vase, and 
fry it; put this in the center of the dish, place the fowls on either side, garnish the 
dish with a garnishing of cockscombs, truffles, mushrooms and ham, cut in fancy 
shapes and pour over one pint of good white sauce, previously made hot. The 
croustade should have fine, ornamented, fancy skewers stuck in it, upon which may 
be arranged some of the pieces out of the garnishing, and two or three crayfish. 

Boiled Stuffed Chicken. 

Fin the body of a cleansed fowl or chicken with small onions, which have been 
half cooked in milk. Boil the giblets with some onions and two or three slices of 
bacon, and when done, strain the gravy in a saucepan, put in the fowl and simmer 
until quite tender. Boil three large onions in a quart of milk, and when it is reduced 
to half its original quantity, thicken with half a teacupful of flour that has been 
smoothly moistened with milk. Stir the sauce over the fire until thick; add two pats 
of butter and a little pepper and salt and stir by the side of the fire until the butter 
is dissolved. Dish the fowl, pour the sauce over, and serve. 

Boiled Chicken with Onions. 

Take a young, fat chicken, singe, draw and truss it for boiling; put it into a 
buttered saucepan with a pint of white broth, sprinkle a little salt and pepper over, 
place the pan over a moderate fire and cook gently for thirty minutes. Blanch one 
pound of small onions, place them in the pan with the chicken and cook gently for 
thirty minutes longer. Whilst the chicken is cooking, it should be turned two or 
three times. Pour the broth and onions over, and serve. 

Boiled Chicken with Poulette Sauce. 

Boil a chicken in broth seasoned with an onion stuck with three cloves, a bunch 
of sweet herbs and a little salt and pepper. Turn half a pound of mushrooms and pre- 
pare one pound of poulette sauce. When the fowl is done, dish it, garnish with the 
mushrooms, pour the sauce over, and serve. 

Boiled Chicken with Rice. 

Singe, draw and truss a chicken and boil it for fifteen minutes ; add one onion 
stuck with three cloves, one saltspoonful each of salt and pepper and a bunch of 
sweet herbs. Take out the onions and herb and put in a breakfast cupful of well washed 



284 POULTRY. 

rice and boil until the rice is tender ; dish the fowl, add a teacupful of gravy or stock to 
the liquor in which it was boiled ; pour the gravy and rice around the fowl, and serve. 

Boiled Chicken with Tarragon Sauce. 

Take a large chicken, singe, truss and draw ; put a piece of butter mixed with a 
handful of tarragon leaves inside ; cover it with thin slices of fat bacon, put it in a 
saucepan with the neck, gizzard and some pieces of trimmings of veal ; add one tea- 
cupful of Madeira wine, sufficient broth to cover, and some fat skimmed off some rich 
stock. When boiling, stand the saucepan at the side of the fire and simmer for three- 
quarters of an hour. Take the chicken out when it is cooked, strain and skim the 
liquor, thicken with a little roux, put in a small bunch of tarragon leaves, and boil for 
twenty minutes. Skim, strain and reduce the sauce, thicken it with the beaten yolks 
of two eggs and stir over the fire until it comes to a boil ; then add a small piece 
of butter and one tablespoonful of blanched green tarragon leaves. Dish the chicken, 
pour the sauce over, and serve. 

Braised Chickens. 

Take three young fat chickens and cut them into quarters; put a little butter at 
the bottom of a saucepan, and when it is melted add a layer of sweet herbs, a little 
onion, shallot and mushrooms, all chopped fine, and a large bunch of parsley. 
Place the legs first, and then the remainder of the fowls on them, sprinkle over a lit- 
tle more sweet herbs, cover over the pan, set it on the fire and place hot ashes on the 
lid. Let this cook for twenty minutes or so, then put the meat on a dish, pour a little 
melted glaze over the herbs, then pour over the chicken, and serve. 

Braised Chickens, Montmorency Style. 

Select a couple of chickens of equal size, draw and singe them and fill the insides 
with a paste made of butter, lemon juice, salt and pepper, and tie them up into shape. 
Put a saucepan of water on the fire, and when it boils dip the breasts of the birds in 
for a few minutes to make the meat firm. Lard the breast with thin strips of fat pork; 
put the chickens into an oval-shaped saucepan with several layers of fat pork around, 
but not over them; add a little good, freshly made broth (for if it has not been made 
fresh it will turn the meat red) to moisten; place the pan on the fire and cover the lid 
over with hot ashes to cook the bacon quickly; when this is a good brown color the 
ashes may be taken off and the fowls left to cook for thirty minutes very gently. 
Then take them out, remove the string and dish with a financiere garnishing. 

Braised Chickens, Printaniere. 

Take a large fowl or chicken, singe, draw and truss and put in a stewpan, add 
eight ounces of chopped bacon and fry the bird lightly. Scald and chop in small 



POULTRY. 285 

squares about half a pound of streaky bacon; put it in a stewpan with four small car- 
rots and onions, season with salt, add a teacupful of broth; put the lid on the stewpan 
with some live embers on the top, stand it over a moderate fire and finish braising. 
Dish the chicken, mix some cooked peas with the vegetables and garnish the dish 
with them. Stir and mix an equal quantity of white sauce with the liquor, boil for a 
few minutes, strain, pour it over, and serve. 

Broiled Chickens. 

Take a chicken, clean, singe and split it down the back; break the joints, take 
out the breast-bone and wipe the bird clean; dust a little pepper and salt over it, 
rub with warm butter, put on a gridiron over a good, clear fire, and broil for twenty 
minutes or so. Place it on a dish with some more butter over and serve quite hot. 
To carve this, separate the legs and wings from the body, and then the breast from 
the lower parts

saucepan, put the fillets in close to each other, place the pan on the fire and cook 
them on both sides for about two minutes, then take them out and drain well. Take 
out the tongue, drain, skin and cut it up, in a slanting direction, into as many slices 
as there are fillets, shaping them like these. Now turn the border out onto a dish, 
and place the fillets and slices of tongue, glazed with a paste brush, alternately

them out and place a paper frill on the small end of each and put them on a dish in a 
circle. Add four or five peeled and chopped raw truffles to the liquor, one wineglass- 
ful of Madeira and a little boiling brown sauce, and, after standing it on the fire a few 
minutes, pour it all over the stuffed legs, and serve. 

Chicken Livers in Cases. 

Take eight fat livers, remove the gall, trim off all the green part, plunge them into 
boiling water and poach without boiling; drain, pare slightly and cut each into halves. 
Put with the trimmings of these livers a few more livers in a fryingpan, add a little

eight cases, either square or round, oil and line them inside with half of the above 
mixture. Fry the livers in a little butter and two tablespoonfuls of white wine over 
a quick fire. When the wine is reduced take out the livers, put them on a plate, dip 
a paste brush with melted glaze and brush them over with it. Cut each of the halves 
of livers in halves again, put two pieces in each of the cases, cover them with a layer 
of forcemeat, put a piece of paper dipped in oil over each, then stand the cases on a 
baking sheet, and warm them at the entrance of a moderate oven. Put the cases of 
liver on a hot dish, pour a little reduced brown sauce over each, and serve. 

Chicken Livers on Skewers. 

Take the livers of eighteen chickens, clean, cut away the galls and dry them well 
with a cloth; season with salt and pepper and cut each liver into halves. In the 
meantime cut off six slices of lean bacon and broil them for one minute, then cut 
each slice into six pieces. Take six silver skewers (attelettes), run one through the 
center of the liver, next a piece of bacon, and continue in this way until the six 
skewers are filled with the pieces of liver and bacon. Roll them in a tablespoonful 
of oil, dip them into sifted breadcrumbs and put them on a moderate fire to broil for 
five minutes on each side. Arrange them on a hot' dish, pour over half a gill of 
maitre d'hotel butter, and serve with a little watercress for garnish.

Minced Chicken with Eggs. 

Take a cold cooked chicken, remove the skin, separate the flesh from the bones 
and cut it into small pieces; put the bones and trimmings into a stewpan with a pint 
and a half of stock, a small onion stuck with two or three cloves, and a small bunch 
of sweet herbs. Boil the stock for an hour, then strain it into a clean stewpan, skim 
off all the fat, put in the pieces of chicken and keep them simmering at the edge of 
the fire. When the bird is tender, mix a tablespoonful of flour with a small quantity 
of milk and stir it into the stock, letting it simmer, but not allowing it to boil. Add 
one teaspoonful of chutney to the sauce and more seasoning if required, and turn the 
whole out onto a dish. Break carefully over the top as many eggs as will just cover 
the mince, but do not crowd them, and be very careful not to damage the yolks; 
strew a few sifted breadcrumbs lightly over the top, dust over with salt and pepper, 
and put them in the oven until the eggs are set, but taking care not to let them get 
hard. When ready, take the dish out of the oven, and serve garnished with croutons 
of fried bread. 

Chicken Patties. 

Take some patty-pans and line with puff paste and bake to a light brown. 
Take any remains of cold roasted chickens and their stuffing, put bones and stuffing 
into a saucepan with one breakfast cupful of water, and stew slowly. Mince the 
chicken very fine. When the gravy, made of the stuffing and bones, is reduced to a 
quarter of a pint, strain and put it on the fire again, add three tablespoonfuls of milk, 
one ounce of butter rolled in flour, and a little pepper and salt. Let this boil for a 
few minutes, stir in the minced chicken and let it get very hot but do not let it boil 
after the chicken is added. Turn the paste out of the tins, arrange on a hot dish, fill 
them with the minced chicken, taking care that it is stirred thoroughly. Serve very 
hot.

onions and four ounces of salted pork cut into square pieces, and cook for three- 
quarters of an hour, taking care to skim well ; add one pint of raw potatoes and 
three tablespoonfuls of flour diluted with a breakfast cupful of water. Stir until it 
boils, and cook for ten minutes. Remove the parsley and transfer the whole to a 
deep earthenware baking-dish, then moisten the edges of this slightly with water, 
and cover the top with crust. Brush the surface over with egg, make a few trans- 
verse lines in the paste with a fork, and cut a hole in the center. Bake in a brisk 
oven for fifteen minutes and send to the table.

broth and one gill of tomato sauce, and add two ounces of dried mushrooms that 
have been soaking in water for several hours, or twelve canned mushrooms, and 
season with salt and pepper, and half a teaspoonful of diluted saffron. When incor- 
porated add half a pint of well-washed uncooked rice and three tablespoonfuls of 
grated Parmesan cheese. Cook for twenty minutes more, and serve. 

Stuffed Chicken Quenelles. 

Place one ounce of gelatine in a basin, cover it with cold water, and soak it for 
an hour. Trim off all the skin from the flesh of a chicken, pick the meat from the 
bones, chop it fine, and pound in a mortar until it is smooth ; then stir in with it one 
tablespoonful of chopped and pounded pork, and pass the whole through a fine sieve. 
Put one breakfast cupful each of stale breadcrumbs and milk in a small saucepan, 
and boil for ten minutes, stirring at the same time to keep it smooth. Mix the bread- 
crumbs with the pounded meat, season with one teaspoonful each of lemon juice and 
onion juice, and pepper and salt to taste ; add six ounces of warmed butter, one 
teacupful of white stock or cream, the yolks of three eggs, and finally the well- 
beaten whites, and work the mixture till it is quite smooth. Put two tablespoonfuls 
of butter into a saucepan together with one tablespoonful of flour, and stir it over the 
fire until smooth but not browned, stir in by degrees one pint of cream, one 
tablespoonful of lemon juice, a little mace, plenty of pepper and salt, and boil for 
two minutes ; then stir in the soaked gelatine, and remove it from the stove. Mix 
three breakfast cupfuls of cold cooked chicken in the sauce, and stand it one side till 
cool. Butter eighteen egg cups, line them with a thick layer of the forcemeat, fill 
the center with the chicken and sauce mixture (it should have become fairly firm), 
then cover it with the forcemeat. Stand the egg cups in a steamer, place a sheet of 
paper over them, place the cover on the steamer, set it over a saucepan of boiling 
water and steam the quenelles for thirty minutes or so without letting the water 
boil too rapidly. When cooked remove them from the pan and stand them one 
side till done. Turn the quenelles out of the egg-cups, dip them well in beaten eggs 
and breadcrumbs and fry for three minutes in boiling fat to lightly color them. 
Drain the quenelles, place them on a hot dish, garnish with stoned olives, and serve. 

Chicken Rissoles. 

Make a well flavored mixture of mushrooms, pickled tongue and the meat of a 
cold fowl, all cooked ; thicken with a little bechamel sauce reduced with glaze, and

POULTRY. 



set it in a basin to cool. Prepare three-quarters of a pound of puff paste and roll it 
out into long, thin strips with the edges trimmed, then take a little of the mixture at 
a time with a small spoon and place it at intervals on the paste, leaving about one 
inch clear from the edge. Wet the edge of the paste and fold it over so as to com- 
pletely cover in the chicken mixture ; then with a channeled paste-cutter cut the 
paste into rissoles, having the meat in the center of the cutter. Roll out the rest of 
the paste, and continue until all the rissoles are made. Dip each one separately into 
well-beaten egg and put them in a fryingpan of fat over a slow fire. When done take 
them out, put them on a dish with a folded napkin, and serve. 

Roast Chicken. 

Take a chicken, clean, singe, and remove the pin feathers; then wipe it clean, 
stuff and truss it. Rub it over with a mixture of salt, pepper, and flour, and warmed 
butter, and put it into a bakingpan with a little chicken fat or dripping, and set it in 
the oven. When the flour is well browned, reduce the heat of the oven, baste well 
with its fat, and afterward with three or four ounces of butter melted in a breakfast 
cupful of boiling water. When the chicken is brown on one side, turn it over on the 
other, so as to color it well all over, adding a little more water if there should not be 
sufficient to baste with. A bird weighing from four and a half to five pounds will 
take about an hour and a half to bake. 

Roasted Chicken, Maryland Style. 

Take two small chickens, detach their legs and wings and lay them on a plate; 
season with salt and pepper, dip them in beaten egg, roll in sifted breadcrumbs, and 
place them in a buttered pan. Pour over an ounce of clarified butter and roast in the 
oven for eighteen minutes. Pour half a pint of cream sauce on to a hot dish, arrange 
the chickens on top, decorate with six thin slices of broiled bacon, also six small corn 
fritters, and serve as hot as possible. 

Roasted Chicken with Chestnut Stuffing. 

Dress two small chickens and boil gently in sufficient water to cover until tender. 
While they are cooking, either boil or roast sufficient chestnuts to fill it. If the nuts 
are roasted, make a cross cut on each to prevent the bursting of the shell. Remove 
the shells and skins of the chestnuts, fill the chicken with them, and brown it quickly 
in a hot oven, basting it every few minutes with butter, salt and pepper mixed 
together. Serve when sufficiently brown. 

Roasted Chicken with Oyster Sauce.

over, and roast in the oven. Blanch twenty or thirty oysters, put them in a stewpan 
with a lump of butter, a few tablespoonfuls of chopped herbs, and a small quantity of 
olive oil, and toss them about over the fire for about twenty minutes. Mix one wine- 
glassful of white wine and about a teacupful of stock with the oysters, put in half an 
ounce of butter kneaded with half a tablespoonful of flour, and stir it over the fire 
until thick. When the chickens are cooked, remove them from the oven, untruss, 
place them on a hot dish, arrange the oysters around with slices of lemon, pour the

Chicken Sauted. 

The Dubois method of preparing this dish is as follows: Put into a stewpan 
some peeled truffles with a wineglassful of wine and a little salt, place the pan on the 
fire and boil, but do not do so until just previous to using them. Put an equal quan- 
tity of mushrooms in a saucepan and boil them, adding a little butter and the juice 
of a lemon. Take a couple of fat chickens, singe, draw and cut off the pinions and 
claws, and remove the legs. Cut the breast up so as to have two fillets and a breast 
part. Chop the bones of the body in halves and break the thick bones of the leg 
with a knife and take them out. Place the legs in a sautepan with a little butter, 
arrange them at the bottom, then put the neck, pinions and bones from the body, 
season them with salt and pepper and place the pan on the fire so that they will fry 
slowly. When they are about half cooked put in the fillets and breast parts, also a 
little parsley, sweet herbs and a clove of garlic; when the meat is set remove it from 
the pan with a skimmer, put it into another sautepan and stir in the truffles; remove 
the fat from the first sautepan, put in the truffle trimmings and a wine-glassful of 
white wine, boil for a few minutes and then add twice its bulk of brown sauce and 
the liquor in which the truffles were cooked. Boil this sauce quickly for ten min- 
utes or so; remove the fat and pass it through a fine sieve onto the chicken meat. 
Warm the meat, taking care not to let the sauce boil again. Put in the center of a 
dish a croustade of fried bread, place the pinions and bones from the body around it; 
then place the fillets and legs around that again, and the parts of the breast on top. 
Garnish the base with some truffles and mushrooms, put a few cockscombs here and 
there, remove the fat from the sauce, and serve the meat with the sauce poured over.

them about until cooked and browned. Strain the gravy from the tarragon stalks 
and mix the leaves with it. Place the pieces of chicken on a hot dish, pour the gravy 
over, and serve right away. Care should be taken to drain the oil off the meat as 
much as possible. 

Scalloped Chicken.

Stewed Chickens. 

Take two chickens, cut off the feet and beat the breast bones until flat, but with- 
out breaking the skin, and dredge them over with a little flour. Put a large lump of 
butter into a stewpan and make it hot, then put in the chickens and fry them until 
brown. Cut one pound of gravy beef and half a pound of beefsteak into thin slices, 
drain the butter out of the pan containing the fowls and cover them with the slices of 
beef; put in a few slices of carrot and onion, a bunclj of sweet herbs, two or three 
cloves, a small piece of mace and a dust of pepper; pour over one quart of boiling 
water, cover the stewpan closely, and stew the contents for a quarter of an hour. 
Take out the chickens but continue boiling the meat until a rich brown gravy is 
formed. When the gravy is ready, strain it through a fine hair sieve, return it to the 
saucepan again with the chickens, add about a teaspoonful of red wine and keep it 
over a slow fire until the chickens are hot through again. If desired, a few mush- 
rooms may be added, but they must be put in after the gravy is strained. Boil some 
thin slices of ham until slightly crisped. Put the chickens on a hot dish, pour the 
gravy around them. Serve garnished with the ham and sliced lemons. 

Stewed Chickens, Cardinal Style. 

Soak two chickens in a basin of cold water for about an hour ; take them out 
and let them drain, then lift up the skin from the breasts and legs as much as possible 
without tearing it, and fill the cavity with forcemeat of fowl, colored with lobster 
spawn to a deep red ; truss the fowls as if for boiling, cover them with thin layers 
of fat bacon, put them in a stewpan with some chopped vegetables, cover with stock 
and simmer gently. Care must be taken that they do not boil fast or the force will 
burst the skin of the fowl, and so look unsightly when served. Dish with an orna- 
mental croustade of fried bread in the center of the dish, garnish with quenelles of 
fowls, both red and white, glazed truffles, cockscombs, crayfish tails and button 
mushrooms, and on each side of the croustade put a larded sweetbread. Serve with

pounded raw, lean ham and an ounce and a half of pork, and pass the mixture 
through a coarse sieve; add two shallots, one tablespoonful of parsley, a little 
thyme and bay leaf, all chopped fine and two ounces of breadcrumbs; make this 
into a paste with two eggs and add a dozen uncooked oysters. Sew the fowl up to 
prevent the stuffing from coming out, tie up in a well-buttered cloth, and put it in a 
saucepan with sufficient boiling stock to cover, and cook gently on the side of the 
fire for thirty minutes or so, according to the size of the bird. Take it out and when 
it is cool, remove the cloth, roll the chicken in flour, dip in beaten egg, cover with

half a glassful of Madeira wine; boil slowly for ten minutes. Take one breakfast 
cupful of chicken forcemeat and add to it one chopped truffle, three chopped mush- 
rooms and half an ounce of cooked minced tongue and stir well. Put the forcemeat 
on a dish, lay the pieces of chicken on top, crownshaped, and decorate with twelve 
whole mushrooms and two thinly sliced truffles. Add half a pint of Spanish sauce, a 
teaspoonful of chopped chives and a small pat of fresh butter to the chicken gravy. 
Pour this immediately over the fowls, put the dish in the oven and cook slowly for 
ten minutes ; squeeze over the juice of half a lemon, and serve with six heart-shaped 
croutons of fried bread. 

Truffled Chicken. 

Bone a fat chicken and put it on a table with the fillets cut off the breasts of 
two other fowls; cut some large slits in them all and put pieces of pork cut into thin 
slips in the cuts. Chop into slices one quart of truffles and put them where they will 
show in the white meat when it is cut; sprinkle well with pepper, salt and powdered 
thyme and a little finely grated nutmeg, and put the pieces of the breasts in the thin- 
nest parts of the fowl, draw the two sides together, sew them up into shapes as near 
the original as possible, wrap the fowl in a cloth, tie it round with a string and boil it 
in salted broth for two hours. Take it out, put it in a mould with a weight on top and 
let it cool. When perfectly cold remove the string and cloth, put it on a dish and 
cut it up in slices; or, it may be put into a mould and filled up with aspic jelly, or 
masked with liquefied butter. 

Vol-au-Vent of Chicken.

it fill some vol-au-vent cases. 

Vol-au-Vent, Toulouse. 

Prepare one-half pound of puff paste, giving it six turns. Roll the paste out to 
about two inches in thickness, and with a small round tin cutter divide the paste into 
rounds; with another tin cutter, one inch smaller in diameter than the one just used, 
cut three parts through the center of each round of paste, thus forming the lids. Place 
the cases on a baking-sheet in a moderate oven, and bake until done, and nicely 
browned. Then lift up the middle pieces carefully and scoop out the underdone 
paste. Prepare a few quenelles of chicken forcemeat, place them in a saucepan with 
the flesh of half of a cooked cold chicken cut into small pieces, two ounces of chopped 
cooked tongue, three or four sliced truffles, five or six mushrooms, three cockscombs 
and one-half pint of supreme sauce. Stir the above mixture over the fire until hot, 



POULTRY. 309 

though not boiling, fill the vol-au-vents with it, arrange them on a folded napkin or an 
ornamental dish-paper laid on a hot dish, and serve without delay. The cases should 
only be filled when ready to serve, as if left standing long the mixture in them is 
likely to make them heavy. 

Chicken, Waldorf Style. 

Boil a chicken till it is tender, take it from the fire, and remove all the white meat, 
cutting it into dice-shaped pieces, and adding two large truffles, cut the same. Put 
these all into a saucepan with a pint of fresh thick cream, season with salt and pepper, 
and allow it to boil for twelve minutes, then thicken with two raw eggTyolks diluted 
in two large spoonfuls of Madeira wine. Stir this thoroughly in with the chicken, 
also two ounces of fresh batter added in small bits, and mingle without letting it boil 
again, then serve.

When the back is slightly colored, surround the duck with whole vegetables, such as 
carrots, potatoes, etc.; add salt, pepper and seasoning, and a breakfast cupful of 
broth; simmer over the fire until the liquid has reduced to glaze, then add broth and 
white wirie to reach to half the height of the duck, cover with thin slices of fat bacon, 
and braise it. When done, take out the duck and vegetables, and reduce the liquor 
to half-glaze. Untruss the duck and dish it; strain and skim the stock and thicken 
with a little brown sauce. Garnish the duck with vegetables, pour a little of the 
sauce over it, and serve the rest in a sauceboat.

glaze and with it mask a few bread-crusts cut into oblong shapes and browned in but- 
ter. Arrange in the center of a dish a heap of green peas or any other vegetable; cut 
the ducks into pieces of fillets, trim them, arrange them with the crusts around the 
pyramid and place a decorated skewer in the center of the heap Mask the fillets of 
duck with brown sauce reduced with Madeira, and serve. Serve the remainder of the

pigeons. 

Braised Pigeons. 

Draw and wash three young pigeons, wipe them well and stuff them with 
breadcrumbs that have been well seasoned and moistened with warmed butter, and 
cook them in a braising pan. Boil some spinach, chop it well, and season with salt 
and pepper. Toast three slices of bread, lay them on a hot dish, spread the spinach 
over them, put a pigeon on each slice, and serve with a sauceboatful of gravy. 

Broiled Pigeons. 

Clean the pigeons, split them down the back, wipe them with a damp towel, and 
sprinkle salt and pepper over them. Roll them in warmed butter, dredge with flour, 
and broil for ten minutes over a clear fire, turning to do both sides equally. Toast 
some thick slices of bread without a crust, butter them and put them on a hot dish. 
When cooked lay the pigeons on the toast, garnish round with parsley, and serve. 

Broiled Pigeons, Crapaudine. 

Clean two pigeons, cut them lengthwise under the breast, beat them flat, and 
season with salt and pepper. Put them in a sautepan with a tablespoonful of butter, 
and fry them for fifteen minutes. Drain them, and place between two plates with a 
weight on top, and leave them till cold. Fry a tablespoonful of chopped shallot in 
the sautepan, then pour in one-half pint of broth, add a little pepper, and boil till 
reduced to half its original quantity. Skim the fat off the gravy, strain it through a 
pointed strainer into a smaller stewpan, and keep it hot. Roll the pieces of pigeon 
in warmed butter, then in breadcrumbs, and broil them over a clear fire, browning 
both sides equally. Put the pigeons on a hot dish, garnishing round with slices of 
lemon, and serve with the gravy in a sauceboat.

; Roasted Pigeons. 

It is well to stuff pigeons for roasting with a well-seasoned veal forcemeat. Their 
flavor is much improved by this means, and parsley fried in butter can then be 
served with them. The stuffing should consist of minced raw veal, fat bacon, bread- 
crumbs soaked in milk, and all mixed together and well seasoned. In America it is 
usual to serve roasted pigeons with red currant jelly or stewed apples without sugar, 
dressed celery or other salad, mashed turnips or squash. All are considered suitable 
for these birds.

Turkeys. 



There is some difference in the methods adopted for trussing a turkey for roasting 
or braising and boiling. For roasting the same process as that described under truss- 
ing poultry is employed. For braising or boiling, trussing differs from the former in 
that the legs are tucked under the apron as follows : 

Singe and draw the bird, cut the legs off at the first joint, pass the finger into 
the inside, raise the skin of the legs, and tuck them under the apron of the bird. 
Pass a skewer through a joint of the wing and the middle joint of the leg, and run it 
through the body and the other leg and wing. Clean the liver and gizzard, and tuck 
them in with the pinions. Turn the small end of the pinion on the back, and fasten 
some twine over the ends of the legs to keep them in their places. 

Turkeys are often boned for making galantines or preparing other dishes in which 
the meat of the turkey without the skeleton is preferred. In some of the following 
recipes the boning of the turkey is prescribed, and the following is the method by 
which it should be done : 

The skin of the turkey for boning must not be broken or damaged in the slightest 
way, otherwise the effect will be spoiled. Pluck and singe the bird, chop off the head 
and lower joints of the legs, and the tips of the wings, and draw out the tendons from 
the legs, loosening the skin round the drumstick. The turkey must not be drawn 
before boning. Place the bird on its breast on a board, and with a sharp knife make 
a cut through the skin of the neck to the middle of the back or near the junction of 
the side bone. Scrape away the flesh with the skin until the end of the shoulder- 
blade is reached, ease the flesh from this and continue to follow the bone to the 
shoulder joint down to the middle joint in the wing. Care must be taken at this 
point, as the skin lies very near the bone. The lower or first bone should be left 



328 POULTRY. 

in the wing, as it is not in the way of carving, and helps to form the bird into 
shape. Should the turkey be small, the wings may be chopped off at the middle 
joint, as there is but little meat on them. Serve the other wing in the same way, 
and then follow the collarbone, loosening the crop from the flesh. Care must again 
be taken in removing the flesh from the breast-bone not to cut through the skin 
on the ridge ; it should be pushed away with the fingers, and the pieces that are 
detached from the other flesh can be inserted in their places afterward. As soon as 
the breast-bone is freed of meat, take off that from the ribs, then take it from the legs 
at the top joint, and then the drumsticks, turning the flesh inside out as if you were 
pulling a glove from your finger. When both of the legs have been boned, scrape 
down to the end of the backbone, and cut through the bone, leaving a part of it in 
the tail to hold the skewers. Now separate the membrane under the body, and all 
the flesh should be in the skin, while the skeleton containing the inside can be pulled 
away at the neck. 

Boiled Turkey. 

Singe and draw a turkey and truss it as for boiling. Wrap the gird in a cloth, 
place it in a saucepan with- plenty of hot water and remove the scum as it rises to the 
top; when the water boils move the saucepan to the side of the fire and let it simmer 
from one hour and a half to two hours, according to the size of the bird. When 
cooked drain the turkey, remove the cloth, put it on a hot dish, pour a small quantity 
of parsley and butter over it, and serve with a sauceboatful of sauce. 

Boiled Turkey, 'English Style. 

Select a very fine tender turkey of about five pounds in weight, singe and draw 
it, and truss with a needle from the wing to the leg. Place it in a soup pot, cook for 
one hour and remove it to a hot dish. Decorate the dish with one pint of cooked 
spinach, English style, and six slices of hot cooked lean ham. Serve with one-half 
breakfast cupful of hot broth poured over the turkey so as to keep it moist. 

Boiled Turkey Stuffed with Celery. 

Wash half a head of celery, chop it vtry fine, mix four heaping tablespoonfuls 
of stale breadcrumbs with it, add one and one-half tablespoonfuls of salt, one-half tea- 
spoonful of pepper, two ounces of warmed butter and two beaten eggs, and stir all to- 
gether until thoroughly mixed. Stuff the turkey with the mixture, sew up the open- 
ings and truss it. Rinse a cloth in cold water, wring it out and dredge it with flour. 
Wrap the turkey in a cloth, tying it securely, place it in a saucepan of boiling water 
and boil it quickly for twenty minutes; then move it to the side of the fire and let it 
simmer. Allow three hours for a turkey weighing nine or ten pounds, and about ten 
minutes for every additional pound. When cooked drain the bird, put it on a hot 
dish, and serve it with a sauceboatful of celery sauce.

seasoned with salt and pepper, or truss it unstuffed. Place it over the fire in a 
sufficient quantity of water to cover it, skim off all the scum as it rises, and boil the 
turkey gently for about two hours, or until it is tender. Place the bird on a dish, 
and serve oyster sauce in a sauceboat. 

Turkey, Bourgeoise Style. 

Singe, draw and truss a turkey, as for roasting, but do not stuff it, and roast it

veal at the bottom of a deep stewpan, put in the turkey, cover it with slices of bacon, 
moisten to its height with stock or broth, put in a bunch of sweet herbs, and season 
to taste with pepper and salt, and let it simmer by the side of the fire. When 
cooked take the turkey out and place it on a hot dish. Skim the fat off the cooking 
liquor, strain it through a fine hair sieve over the bird, and serve. 

Braised Turkey. 

Draw a turkey, truss it as for boiling, and stuff it with a chestnut-and-truffle 
stuffing, which should be made as follows Peel off the dark skin from a quantity 
of chestnuts, place them in a saucepan with two bay leaves, a handful of coriander 
seeds, a lump of salt and plenty of water, boil, and when nearly soft, drain them, and 
remove the inner skin. Put one pound of finely-minced bacon and two or three chopped 
shallots into a stewpan, and toss them over the fire for a few minutes. Cut one pound 
of chestnuts up into small pieces, put them in with the bacon, add one-half pound of 
truffles, also cut into moderate-sized pieces, and season to taste with pepper, salt, spices 
and a moderate quantity each of thyme and marjoram. Stir the mixture over the fire 
for two or three minutes longer, then stuff the bird with it. Put a few slices of bacon at 
the bottom of a stewpan and put in the bird with three or four sliced carrots, onions, 
a clove of garlic, a bunch of sweet herbs tied together with a few sprigs of parsley 
and a bay leaf, add a few peppercorns and salt to taste, moisten to height with one- 
half pint of sherry and clear stock and cover with a sheet of buttered paper. Put 
the lid on the pan with some hot ashes on it, and place it over a slow fire. Braise 
the turkey for about four hours, and when cooked, place it on a hot dish. Strain the 
cooking liquor into a small saucepan, skim off all the fat and boil it up again; then 
pour it over the bird, garnish round with potato croquettes and Brussels sprouts, and 
serve.

as possible, scald the feet and rub off the skin. Peel three pounds of truffles and 
cut them into small balls. Put one and one-half pounds of grated fat bacon into a 
fryingpan, put in two shallots, two bay leaves, two sprigs of thyme and one clove of 
garlic, season to taste with pepper and salt and fry over a slow fire. When cool, 
strain the melted bacon fat into a basin and put in the truffles and half of the truf- 
fle trimmings, chopped. Stuff the turkey with the above mixture and truss it as for 
boiling. Line a braisingpan with slices of fat bacon, place the turkey in wrapped in 
a sheet of buttered paper, and cover it with three pints of mirepoix and one-half pint of 
Madeira. When the liquor boils, move the braisingpan to the side of the fire, place 
hot ashes on the lid and braise the turkey. Make some hot perigueux sauce, using up 
the balance of the truffle trimmings. When cooked, drain the turkey, untie it, place 
it on a hot dish, pour some of the hot sauce over it, and serve with the remainder in 
a sauceboat. 

Braised Larded Turkey with Chestnut Puree. 

Singe and draw a small turkey, break the breastbone, cut the legs at the first 
joint and remove the bone to shorten the legs. When the legs have been singed, 
push them into the thighs by the opening of the drumsticks. Chop fine a quantity 
of beef-suet, mix an equal quantity of breadcrumbs with it, and truss the bird with a 
strong string. Set the skin of the breast and legs by singeing, and lard it with bacon. 
Put some trimmings of bacon and vegetables into a braisingpan, put in the turkey, 
moisten it to its height with broth and cover it with a sheet of buttered paper. 
When boiling, move the pan to the side of the fire, put some hot ashes on the lid and 
let the broth simmer till the turkey, which should be continually basted with its own 
cooking liquor, is done. Glaze the breast of the bird with a paste-brush, and when 
well browned, drain ft and put it on a hot dish. Mix an equal quantity of white 
wine with the cooking liquor, skim off the fat, strain it through a fine hair sieve into 
another stewpan and boil it quickly until it is reduced to half-glaze. Serve the 
turkey with the sauce in a sauceboat and a separate dish of chestnut puree. 

Turkey Breasts, Spanish Style. 

Proceed as for turkey breasts chipolata, but after cooking for twenty minutes 
only take the turkey off, place it in another saucepan and baste it with its own gravy, 
adding one-half pint of Spanish sauce. Blanch one-half pint of chicken or turkey 
livers, cut them into two or three pieces each, according to their size, and put them 
into a saucepan with the turkey, adding one-half wineglassful of Madeira wine. Cook 
for twenty minutes longer, and serve with the livers placed round the breasts and the 
gravy poured over.

Turkey Croquettes. 



Cut the meat off the breast of a cold cooked turkey, trim off the skin and fat 
and cut the lean into small squares; put them into a saucepan with an equal quantity 
of rice that has been boiled in broth till dry and of whole grain, sprinkle in one table- 
spoonful of curry powder and keep it covered. Pour one pint of bechamel sauce into 
a flat stewpan and boil it until reduced, stirring and adding gradually sufficient melted 
glaze to bring it to a creamy consistency. Mix one tablespoonful of curry powder 
with a small quantity of milk, stir it into the sauce, then pour the whole over the 
meat and rice. Stir the mixture over the fire for five minutes, then turn it into a 
basin and leave it until cool. When firm divide the mixture into equal quantities 
with a tablespoon, roll them in finely grated breadcrumbs, dip them in beaten egg and 
roll in breadcrumbs again. Boil a quantity of lard in a fryingpan, plunge the cro- 
quettes into it and fry them until they are well and equally browned. When cooked 
drain them, put them on a dish-paper placed on a hot dish, garnish, and serve. 



Fillets of Turkey, Milanese. 



Remove the sinewy skin from two breast fillets that have been cut from a small 
raw turkey, cut the meat into slices slanting lengthwise, trim them and beat them 
lightly. Dip the slices in beaten egg and then in freshly-grated breadcrumbs. Melt 
a lump of butter in a fryingpan, put the fillets in and fry them quickly on both sides 
till well browned. Put a garnish of rice with mayonnaise in the center of a hot dish; 
when cooked arrange the fillets in a circle round it, pour over them the butter in 
which they were cooked, and serve them. 

Turkey Fricassee. 

Separate the meat from the bones of some remains of cold cooked turkey, cut it 
into small pieces, and season it with salt, pepper and grated nutmeg. Pour one tea- 
cupful of milk into a saucepan with a thin strip of lemon peel, and boil it for five 
minutes. Mix one dessertspoonful of cornstarch to a paste with a little cold milk, 
then stir it into the milk in the saucepan, and keep on stirring it over the fire for two 
minutes; then take out the lemon peel, remove the sauce from the fire, and allow it 
to cool for several moments. Add one-half ounce of butter to the sauce, put it in the 
cut-up meat, and stir it over the fire until hot. While the turkey is being warmed up 
fry some thin squares of bacon. Turn the turkey onto a hot dish, arrange the bacon 
around, and serve. 

Turkey Giblets. 

These should be carefully preserved as they come in very handy for making 
sauce or gravy, or they can be used to make dishes by themselves. The old-fashioned 
system of tucking the gizzard and the liver into the wings when trussing for roasting

POULTRY. 



has long since been condemned by common sense, they being spoiled by drying and 
hardening in the cooking. 

The gizzard, liver and heart should be placed in a pan of water as soon as it is 
removed from the interior of the bird. The liver should be well squeezed in the 
water in order to disgorge it of its blood, and the heart should be cut open and also 
disgorged. The gizzard or crop should be cut open and all the stones or other con- 
tents be washed out; the thick white lining can be peeled off. The feet must be 
scalded and skinned, and any odd pieces of the neck may also be skinned and other- 
wise cleaned for making gravy. 



Turkey Giblets on Skewers. 



Remove the gall from the livers of two or three turkeys, and cut them into 
moderate-sized squares, split the hearts in two, open and empty the gizzards and 
wash them well in warm water. Run a thread through the gizzards, put them into a 
saucepan with a quantity of stock, and boil them for three-quarters of an hour. 
Drain, divide and trim off the hard skin, and cut them into the same sized pieces as 
the livers. Season the giblets with chopped parsley, pepper and salt, and baste them 
with a small quantity of oil, and mix with them the same quantity of thin squares of 
bacon as there are gizzard and liver squares. File the meat on skewers in alternate 
order, roll them in finely grated breadcrumb, place them side by side on a gridiron 
and broil them over a clear fire, turning them when done on one side. When nicely 
browned put the skewers of giblets on a folded napkin laid on a hot dish, and serve. 



Stewed Turkey Giblets with Turnips. 

Clean and blanch a pair of turkey giblets. Divide the neck and gizzard each into four 
pieces, and cut the pinions and legs in two. Cut one-half pound of streaky bacon 
into slices one inch thick, then divide them into pieces one and one-half inches long; 
place them in a stewpan with a piece of butter and fry till they are lightly browned. 
Take the bacon out, put in the giblets and fry them. Put the bacon back into the 
stewpan with the giblets, add one pound of turnips cut to the shape of corks, ten or 
twelve button onions and one ounce of butter. Fry the above ingredients until 
browned, then put in fifteen peeled potatoes, a bunch of sweet herbs and one quart 
of water; season with salt and pepper and let the whole simmer gently by the side of 
the fire for an hour and a half. Ten minutes before dishing the stew, put in the 
turkey livers. When cooked, take the bunch of sweet herbs out of the stew and 
skim off the fat. Turn the giblets onto a hot dish, arranging them with the heart, 
livers, gizzards and legs in the center of the dish, place the pieces of neck round 
them, put the pinions on top, pour over the remainder of the stew, and serve at once.

When served the breast only is carved. Stick the fork straight and firmly into 
the middle of the breastbone, commence from the neck down to the back, straight to 
the backbone, and around the back ; then from the point of starting around the collar- 
bone. Cut the joint off the wing. Commence cutting again from the point of start- 
ing ; carefully and gently carving off the entire breast so that no meat remains. 
Proceed precisely the same with the other side. When finished there will remain 
only the carcass. The more quickly the duck is cooked the finer flavored it will be ; 
and the hot dish for serving and also hot plates should always be ready before the 
ducks are done. The ducks should never be overdone. 

Broiled Canvas-Back Ducks. 

Take a fine fat canvas-back duck, pick, singe, draw and wipe it thoroughly. Split

Put two and a half breakfast cupfuls of game sauce into a stewpan with the flesh 
of any cold cooked game cut up small; stir over the fire until hot, season with salt 
and a small quantity of sugar, then move the pan to the side. Roll out one pound of 
puff paste to a quarter of an inch in thickness, cut out some rounds with a fluted tin 
cutter about an inch and a half in diameter, sprinkle water over a baking sheet, lay 
the rounds on it and brush them over with a paste brush dipped in beaten egg. 
With a plain tin cutter, a size smaller than the one previously used, mark a ring on 
the top of each piece of paste, dipping the cutter into hot water every time. Bake 
the paste in a quick oven for twenty minutes, keeping the oven door closed. When 
cooked, take the bouchees out of the oven, and lift off the lids as carefully as possible 
with a sharp-pointed knife so as not to break them; scrape out the soft paste, leaving 
a hollow, fill them with the game, replace the lids, put them on a folded napkin on a 
hot dish, and serve. 



342 GAME. 

Game Croquettes. 

Take the white flesh of any cold roasted game; melt a lump of butter in a stew- 
pan and mix with it one scant tablespoonful of flour, then put in the minced game 
and season to taste with salt, pepper and a small quantity of nutmeg; stir over the 
fire until very hot, then move it to the side and mix in the beaten yolks of one or 
two eggs and the strained juice of half a lemon. Spread the mixture on a dish and 
leave it until nearly cold. Divide and mould the mixture into small balls, dip them 
in beaten eggs and roll in fine breadcrumbs sufficient to cover. Put a large piece of 
butter or clarified fat into a flat stewpan, place it on the fire, and when the fat boils 
put in the croquettes and fry them until nicely and equally browned. Spread a 
folded napkin on a hot dish, pile the croquettes on it, garnish with fried parsley, and 
serve. 

Game Cutlets. 

Take any cold cooked game and cut the flesh into dice. Soak a third of an 
ounce of gelatine for an hour and a half in a breakfast cupful of water. Put two 
tablespoonfuls of butter into a fryingpan; when it is hot add one tablespoonful of 
flour, mix well until brown and quite smooth, add a pint of rich stock, one egg, four 
cloves, a tablespoonful of onion juice, and salt and pepper to taste; simmer for ten min- 
utes and pour it over the game. Return all to the pan and simmer for a quarter of 
an hour longer. Beat one egg in a basin, add it to the gelatine, stir it into the mix- 
ture and remove from the fire at once. Put the pan into a larger one with cold 
water so that it will cool, stirring well. When cold, turn the mixture into a shallow 
bakingdish smoothing it to about an inch in thickness and set it on the ice to get 
hard; cut it into cutlet shapes with a knife that has been dipped in water, then place 
the dish in another one of warm water to loosen the cutlets from the bottom. Pre- 
pare one quart of game forcemeat, cover the cutlets over with it and return them to 
the ice again. Beat two eggs in a basin, remove the cutlets from the ice and cover 
them over with the eggs and afterwards with breadcrumbs; put two or three at a time 
into a frying basket, plunge them into boiling fat and fry for two minutes; take them 
out, drain and put them on brown paper until drained. Stick a bone in the end of 
each, garnish it with a paperfrill, arrange the cutlets in a circle on a dish, and serve 
with parsley. 

Deviled Game. 

Clean and prepare any game in season and half roast it. Mix equal quantities of 
salt, cayenne and curry powder and then add double this quantity of powdered dried 
truffles. Put the entrails and brains of the bird in a mortar, crush them well and add 
the yolk of a hard boiled egg, the grated rind of a lemon, a dessertspoonful of chutney, 
a little soy, a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, a wineglassful of Madeira and the 
juice of half an orange or lemon. Dust the bird over with the powder, put it in a 



GAME. 343 

dish with the brain mixture, place the dish over a spirit lamp in a chafingdish, cover 
tightly and cook until the flesh is thoroughly incorporated with the mixture. Now 
add a little salad oil; let it get hot, turn out on a dish, and serve as quickly as possible. 

Fillets of Game in Cases. 

Make some cases of white paper, butter them and put a piece of bacon fat in 
each. Cut any cold roasted game into slices, put them in the cases, place a little 
bacon fat over each, strew grated breadcrumbs on the top and bake in a brisk oven 
until browned. Spread a folded napkin or an ornamental dish-paper on a hot dish 
and arrange the cases on it, garnishing here and there with fried parsley. 

Game Pie. 

Rub four ounces of butter into twelve ounces of flour and make it into a paste 
by adding one egg, half of which may be beaten up with water sufficient to make the 
paste firm and consistent. Knead it thoroughly and cut off a piece about the size of 
a large apple to form the lid of the pie. Butter a raised pie mould, line it with the 
paste, pressing it into shape and cut it round at the top, leaving about half an inch 
above the mould. Clean and wash any game, such as grouse, partridge, pheasant or 
hare, cut them up, and take out all the bones ; chop up the hearts and livers, mix in 
one pound of sausage-meat and two ounces of breadcrumbs, blend together, working 
with the hand and adding pepper and salt to taste. When thoroughly mixed, put a 
layer of it at the bottom of the mould, then half of a bird and sprinkle it over with a 
teaspoonful each of salt and pepper and half a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg; 
cover with another layer of the sausage-meat, together with a few halves of truffles 
and square pieces of cooked beef tongue, then another half bird and continue in 
this order until the mould is quite full. Damp the edges of the crust with a wet 
paste brush, cover it with the paste lid, press the edges together to anneal them, 
trim round the edge, decorate the top with paste leaves or flowers, brush over with 
egg, make a hole in the center and put the pie in a moderate oven for about an hour 
and a half. Put the bones in a small saucepan with a little water or broth, and boil 
for an hour and a half; that is, while the pie is baking ; strain this gravy and pour it 
into the pie, when it is done, through a funnel inserted into the hole; remove the mould 
shape, and when the pie is cold, take off the lid, fill it up with chopped aspic jelly, 
put it on a dish, garnish with more of the jelly, and serve. 

Salmis of Game. 

Cut the meat from some cold-roasted game into small pieces; break the bones 
and put them with the trimmings in a stewpan, add one pinch of sweet herbs, two 
cloves, two peppercorns and some cold water; set it on the fire and boil. Fry two 
small-sliced onions in butter until brown; sift in two tablespoonfuls of flour and stir 



344 GAME. 

until cooked. Strain the liquor in which the bones were boiled, mix with it the flour 
and onions, put in two tablespoonfuls of Worcestershire sauce, one tablespoonful of 
lemon juice, a pinch of salt and the pieces of meat. Simmer for fifteen minutes and 
add a few button mushrooms. Fry some slices of bread without crusts in butter, put 
them on a hot dish, pour over the salmis, garnish with fried parsley, and serve. 

Game Souffles. 

Cut off about two pounds of flesh from any cold roasted game, trim off the skin, 
chop the flesh, pound it in a mortar, then pass it through a fine hair-sieve. Mix three- 
quarters of a pint of Spanish sauce with one teacupful of essence of fowls and boil un- 
til it is reduced to one-third. Mix the pounded game into the sauce and leave it until 
cold. Beat the yolks of ten eggs and mix them with the puree; whip the whites of 
the eggs to a stiff froth, add them to the mixture and season with a little grated nut- 
meg and salt and pepper. Fill some small paper cases with the mixture, put them 
into a quick oven and bake for fifteen minutes. Place the cases on a dish, and serve 
garnished with fried parsley and slices of lemon. 

Vbl-au-Vent of Cold Game. 

Cut the meat from any cold cooked game into pieces and mix with it an equal 
quantity of cold ham or beef tongue, also cut into small pieces. Break up the bones 
of the bird and put them with the trimmings into a saucepan; add a blade of mace, 
two or three allspice, a small quantity of salt and nutmeg, and about two-thirds of a 
breakfast cupful of white stock, and boil gently for half an hour. Rub the skin off a 
few small button mushrooms with apiece of flannel dipped in salt, put them in a stew- 
pan, strain the gravy from the bones over them, and stew gently. When they are 
nearly cooked put in the meat with two or three tablespoonfuls of minced truffles, one 
teacupful of thick cream and one ounce of butter worked into a tablespoonful of flour. 
Stir the whole over the fire until boiled and quite thick. Prepare a vol-au-vent case 
by rolling out some paste one inch thick laid on a greased baking sheet, and cutting 
a round as large as a dinner plate; mark out with the point of a knife an inner circle 
about one inch from the edge and not more than a quarter of an inch deep, bake it, 
and after removing the thin inner circle pile up the center with the game preparation. 
Cut up the thin slab from the center into shapes and lay over the game mixture, pre- 
viously brushing with white of egg each place where the ornament is to be laid. Pass 
the salamander over the top, and serve on a hot dish. 

Baked Wild Goose with Mushroom or Celery Sauce. 

Pluck, draw and singe a wild goose and steep it in salted water for several hours. 
Cut an onion into slices, put it in the inside, sew it up and plunge it in a saucepan of 
boiling water for twenty minutes. Take it out, remove the onion and stuff the bird

with a little celery and mashed potatoes, a few hard boiled eggs and a little fat pork 
or any other cold meat, all very finely chopped; also a grated turnip, a little chopped 
onion, a tablespoonful of pepper, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Sew it up, 
truss it and put it in a bakingdish with a teacupful of stock or broth, brush over with 
warmed butter, dust with flour, put a piece of well-buttered paper over the breast, and 
bake in a moderate oven till done. Place it on a dish and pour over it either its own 
gravy or a little mushroom or celery sauce. Garnish the dish with sprays of water- 
cress, and serve. 

Broiled Grouse. 

Singe, draw and wipe three or four grouse, split them in halves through the backs 
without separating the parts, lay them in a dish and season with salt, pepper and one 
tablespoonful of sweet oil. Roll them well in it, then put them over a brisk fire and 
broil for seven minutes on each side. Put one tablespoonful of butter and a finely- 
chopped shallot in a small saucepan on a hot range, cook for one minute, add two 
chopped mushrooms, moisten with one tablespoonful of rich sauce, add one table- 
spoonful of made mustard, stir all well together, season with salt and cayenne, and 
cook for one minute longer. Pour the sauce on a hot dish, place the grouse over, 
decorate the dish with slices of broiled bacon, lemon and truffles, and serve very hot. 

Fried Grouse Cutlets. 

Prepare three young grouse and cut them in halves lengthwise, split the drum- 
stick and push it inside the hip; beat each half slightly, skin, roll in clarified 
butter and breadcrumbs, season with salt and pepper and fry for twelve or four- 
teen minutes over a moderate fire, turning them so as to cook both sides. Make 
a sauce as follows: Put a small bunch of herbs in a saucepan with the juice of two 
lemons and two dessertspoonfuls of finely-chopped shallots; boil for two minutes 
with the cover on the pan, add one teacupful of raw mushrooms cut into small 
squares, simmer until the liquor is reduced, then pour in one breakfast cupful of 
melted meat-glaze. When boiling move the stewpan from the fire and stir in five 
ounces of butter; when this is melted, without boiling, and the sauce well thick- 
ened, add a little vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of gherkins cut into small squares, one 
tablespoonful of soy and one tablespoonful of tarragon leaves chopped small. Dish 
the cutlets, and serve with the sauce poured over. 

Larded Grouse 

Clean and thoroughly wash a grouse, and lard the legs and breast, placing a 
skewer through the legs and tail; rub some warmed butter over the breast, then 
dredge it over with a little salt and plenty of flour. Place it on a bakingdish and 
set it in a brisk oven, and cook for from twenty to thirty minutes. Cover a hot dish 



346 GAME. 

with bread sauce, put the grouse on it, and sprinkle over some fried breadcrumbs. 
Garnish with parsley, and serve. 

Grouse Pie. 

Singe and draw three young grouse, and remove their feet, necks and pinions; 
divide their bodies each into three pieces, and put them in a stewpan with the pinions 
and some chopped bacon; fry and put in six ounces of chopped ham (raw), a bunch 
of sweet herbs and parsley and a little salt and pepper. When the ham is cooked 
add about eighteen mushrooms cut in halves, and one tablespoonful of chopped 
onion; pour in two tablespoonfuls of white wine and reduce the liquor. Take the 
stewpan off the fire and let the contents cool. Arrange the meat in a piedish, with 
hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters amongst it, pour over the gravy through a conical- 
shaped strainer, and cover with puff paste ; brush the crust over with whites of 
eggs, and place in a hot oven until done. Take the pie out of the oven, lift the 
crust, pour in a little more thickened game gravy, and serve either hot or cold. 

Roasted Grouse. 

Pluck and singe a grouse, draw it and allow it to hang in a cool place for 
several days. Wipe it well inside without washing, chop off its head and truss it; 
place a large lump of butter inside; put it on a spit in front of a clear fire, and roast 
for from thirty to forty minutes, basting frequently with butter. Put the liver of the 
grouse into a saucepan of water with a small lump of butter, salt and pepper to 
taste, boil it until it is like a paste, take it out, spread it over pieces of toast on a 
dish, place the grouse on the top, and serve with a sauceboatful each of rich gravy 
and bread sauce. 

Salmis of Grouse. 

Singe, draw, wipe and truss two grouse, season with salt, put a few small pieces 
of butter over them, place them in a roastingpan in a brisk oven, and cook for eight 
or ten minutes. Untruss and cut away the wings, legs and breasts. Place one ounce 
of butter in a saucepan with about one-half a carrot cut into small pieces, half an 
onion cut the same, two bay leaves, a sprig of thyme, and six whole peppers, and 
fry to a golden color, which will take about five or six minutes. Hash the bodies of 
the two grouse and add them to the other ingredients. Moisten with one pint of 
Spanish sauce, one-half breakfast cupful of mushroom liquor, one-half wineglassful of 
sherry, and the zest of a lemon, season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, and cook for 
twenty minutes. Then put the wings, legs and breasts into a separate saucepan and 
strain the sauce over, adding two minced truffles and six minced mushrooms. Cook 
for three minutes longer, dress them on a hot dish, and serve with croutons of fried 
bread for a garnish. 



GAME. 347 

Stewed Grouse. 

Take a brace of grouse and truss and stuff them. Place one-fourth pound of 
butter or good dripping into a fryingpan and fry in it while it is quite hot, first one 
grouse and then the other, turning them so as to brown them all over. In the mean- 
time have one-half pint of good gravy heating in a small saucepan. When both birds 
are browned put them in a large saucepan, pour the hot gravy over, place the lid on 
tight and let them stew very gently for an hour until they are tender; then put them 
on a hot dish and cover, to keep the heat and flavor in. Let the gravy cool a little, 
skim off the fat that rises and strain it. Put it over the fire again, stir in enough 
brown flour to thicken, and boil hard for five minutes; skim again, place the birds 
back in the gravy and let them get quite hot, but do not let the gravy boil after they 
are put in. Place them on a hot dish, pour a little of the gravy over, and serve the 
balance in a small tureen. Green peas and currant jelly may also be served separate. 

Supreme of Grouse, Richelieu Style. 

Singe, draw and wipe three grouse, removing the skin from the breasts. With a 
sharp knife make an incision on the top of each breastbone from end to end. Care- 
fully cut off the entire breasts on both sides, including the small wing bone, taking 
care not to leave a particle of meat on the bones. Remove the small fillets found 
under the breasts, putting them one side for further use. Make an incision in the 
breasts at the thinnest side, about three inches long, and one inch in depth, season 
them inwardly with pepper and salt, stuff them with chicken forcemeat mixed with 
two truffles and four mushrooms, all finely sliced, and put them into a buttered saute- 
pan. Gently press the small fillets, using the fingers to give them a hollow shape. 
Make six slanting, small incisions on the top of each, and insert in them a small piece 
of smoked beef, one-half inch in diameter; moisten slightly the top of the breasts 
with water, place a fillet lengthwise on them, and sprinkle over a little clarified but- 
ter, using a feather brush. Pour into the pan, but not over the meat, one-fourth 
wineglassful of Madeira wine and two tablespoonfuls of mushroom catsup, lightly 
cover the pan and place it in a hot oven for ten minutes. Arrange the supremes on 
a hot dish, and serve with a little Perigueux sauce boiled for three minutes with one 
teacupful of tomato sauce, in a sauceboat 

Broiled Guinea Fowls. 

Pluck, singe and draw two or three Guinea fowls, wash them thoroughly, and 
split down the backs; wipe dry and flatten them slightly. Dust, salt and pepper over 
both sides, dip them in flour, and put them on a gridiron over a clear fire. Brush 
over frequently with a little butter, and when they have been cooking for about fifteen 
minutes, put them on a dish, pour over a rich gravy, and garnish with mashed potatoes. 



348 GAME. 

Roasted Larded Guinea Fowl. 

Plunge, singe and draw a Guinea fowl, lard the breasts with strips of fat bacon, 
and truss it like a pheasant. Put it on a spit in front of a clear fire and roast for an 
hour, basting frequently with butter. Sprinkle it well with flour, cook for ten or 
fifteen minutes longer, place it on a dish, pour round a little rich gravy, and serve 
with a sauceboatful of rich gravy. 

Hares. 

Before cooking a hare it must be skinned, and if intended for roasting it must be 
trussed, so as to give it a good effect. This is done in the following manner: 

Chop off the feet of the first joints, lift the skin from the back, and draw it first 
over the hind legs and then over the fore legs; let the tail remain on with the hair; 
cut the skin from the head and ears, leaving the latter on, cut through the sinews of 
the legs, and bring the hind legs forward, passing a skewer through both of them as 
well as the body, and bring the fore legs back, passing a skewer through them also. 
Fix the head upright by means of a skewer thrust through the mouth to the back of 
the head and then into the back between the shoulders. Wipe the inside very dry, 
stuff, and sew it up. Pass a string round the ends of the skewers which fix the legs, 
drawing it over the back of the hare so as to keep the legs close up to the body. 

A very popular mode of preparing hares for cooking is to remove the bones, and 
re-form the body in such a way that it may be carved without difficulty. The method 
of procedure for this boning is as follows: 

The hare should be fresh. Skin and clean it as directed, and then with a sharp 
knife begin cutting down along the crest of the backbone, and dissect the flesh from 
the ribs. Do not disconnect the flesh, but leave it hanging. Separate the backbone 
from the head at the first joint of the neckbone, leaving the head on, then pass the 
knife carefully under the flesh down the middle of the back until the whole of the 
bone is clear. The legs may be either cut off or dissected out. The hollow from 
which the spine and ribs have been taken should next be stuffed with forcemeat or 
well-seasoned bread stuffing, the belly sewn together, and the hare fastened with 
string and skewers, in order to bring it into as nearly its original shape as possible. 



Hares Backs with Poivrade Sauce. 

Remove the backs of a couple of hares, lard them with strips of firm bacon fat, 
wrap them round with buttered or oiled paper, place them on the spit in front of a 
clear fire, and roast until done. About five minutes before taking them from the fire, 
remove the paper so as to glaze them with thin liquor, put them on a dish, and serve 
poivrade sauce in a sauceboat. 



GAME. 



Baked Hare. 



349 



Select two nice hares, cut them into halves, separating the fore from the hind 
quarters. Bone the saddles down to the legs, but do not bone the legs; put them in a 
deep earthenware dish, pour in one wineglassful of white wine and add one fair-sized 
sliced lemon, one sliced and peeled onion and one sprig of thyme, seasoning with 
pepper, salt and two or three cloves. Roll the saddles well in the seasoning several 
times and place one side to steep for twelve or fourteen hours. Take out the pieces, 
stuff the bone saddles with a rich stuffing, give them a round shape and tie them so 
as to hold them firmly. Place a piece of fat pork over each saddle, put them in a 
roastingpan with one carrot and one onion cut into slices and placed at the bottom 
of the pan, and pour over one pint of broth. Put the pan in a hot oven and bake for 
forty-five to fifty minutes, taking care to baste frequently with the gravy that comes 
from them. Take them from the oven, untie, dress on a hot dish, strain the gravy 
over the saddles, decorate the dish with heart-shaped croutons, and serve. The fore 
quarters can be used for civets or other dishes. 

Broiled Hare. 

Rub the legs and shoulders of a hare with butter, lay them in a deep earthen- 
ware dish with one large sliced onion, a small quantity of thyme and parsley, a bay- 
leaf, a moderate quantity of pepper and salt, one breakfast cupful of vinegar, and half 
as much water. Cover the hare with another dish and let it macerate for two days. 
Drain the pieces of hare, rub again with butter, lay them on a gridiron and broil over 
a clear fire, turning when done on one side. When cooked lay the pieces on a hot 
dish covered with a folded napkin and garnished with fried parsley, and serve. 

Civet of Hare. 

Skin and clean a hare, using care to save all the blood; chop off the hind legs, 
and cut them up into two or three pieces; also divide the body into equal parts. Cut 
one-half pound of bacon into small pieces about one inch in thickness, and blanch in 
boiling water. Remove, drain and fry in a stewpan with a little butter until quite 
brown; take them from the pan, throw in the pieces of hare and cook until they are 
quite firm. Lift them out, and mix in a little flour to thicken the gravy; then add 
one quart of broth, and one pint of red wine. Put the pieces of hare back again, also 
the bacon, and add a bunch of parsley, a few spices, onions, pepper and salt to taste, 
and a little trimmings of mushrooms. Put the pan on the fire again and boil for an 
hour. Skim off the fat and place the pieces of hare and bacon (one at a time) in a 
clean saucepan. Skim the sauce again, put it on the fire and reduce until it is quite 
thick and will stick to the hare after having been passed through a fine sieve. Put a 
few onions fried in butter to a light brown in a saucepan with a little broth, and stew

them; add a few mushrooms also fried in butter, and the blood and liver to thicken. 
Warm up and let it remain on the side of the fire, taking care not to boil it, or the 
blood will be likely to curdle, when the sauce would not be dark enough in color. 
Place the pieces of meat on a dish, and serve with onion broth poured over the hare. 

Civet of Hare, Bourgeoise. 

Clean a hare and cut into small pieces, saving the blood. Put two ounces of 
butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour into a stewpan, and stir them over the fire 
until well mixed; then put in the pieces of hare, with a few slices of fat bacon, a bunch 
of sweet herbs, some mushrooms and artichoke bottoms, a few small onions fried in 
butter and pepper and salt, moistening with one-half pint of white wine and enough 
stock to cover. Stew the hare until tender, and then put the pieces on a dish. Skim 
the sauce, remove the bunch of herbs, add the crushed liver of the hare, also the blood, 
and boil again. Pour the sauce over the hare, and serve. 

Civet of Hare, French Style. 

Skin a good-sized hare, draw it, and preserve the blood should there be any, and 
also the liver, with the gall carefully removed. Place the blood and the liver on the 
same dish, and cut the hare into a dozen pieces; put these into a stone jar, seasoning 
with salt, pepper and nutmeg, adding also one sliced onion, one sprig of thyme, two 
bay leaves and half a wineglassful of white wine; stir all together well, and steep for 
six hours. Remove the pieces of hare, put them in a saucepan with one ounce of 
butter, adding twelve glazed small onions, and one ounce of salted pork cut into small 
pieces, and cook on a sharp fire for ten minutes; then add three tablespoonfuls of 
flour; stir thoroughly and moisten with one wineglassful of red wine and one pint of 
white broth, and stir until it boils, seasoning again with pepper and salt. Cook for 
one hour longer, and fifteen minutes before it is done put in the blood, also the heart 
and liver, both finely chopped and mixed together. Serve with croutons of fried 
bread for a garnish. 

Fried Fillets of Hare with Quenelles. 

Take two fillets of hare, trim, cut them slantwise across into five pieces each, 
moisten and beat a little, then sprinkle them over with salt and pepper. Pour a little 
melted butter into a flat stewpan, and put in the fillets, arranging them side by side. 
Prepare a little game gravy with the bones and remaining parts of the hare, adding a 
small quantity of thickened brown sauce. Prepare a forcemeat with the trimmings 
of the fillets, shape them into quenelles with a small spoon, and poach them in 
salted water. Place the pan with the fillets on the fire and fry briskly, turning 
them in order to cook both sides. Take out and drain ; pour on four tablespoon-

fuls of sauce, put them on a dish and pour the remainder of the sauce over. Place 
the quenelles around the dish, and serve. 

Larded Fillets of Hare, Minute Style. 

Skin and clean a hare, cut off the fillets, lard and put them into a basin, season 
with ground mixed spice, pour over enough oil to moisten, and let them soak for one 
hour. In the meantime pour some stock in a saucepan, and reduce it nearly to a 
glaze; then add a slice of fat bacon and the larded fillets, cover with a piece of but- 
tered paper, and simmer for twelve minutes, by which time the fillets should be well 
cooked and browned. Great care should be taken not to let the fillets burn. Put 
them onto a dish, add a little rich stock to the glaze, stir well, pour it over, and serve. 

Fillets of Hare with Poivrade Sauce. 

Clean two hares, cut off the fillets, remove the skin, and lard them well, 
using a small needle. Place them in a deep dish, and season with salt and pepper, 
adding one onion and one carrot cut in small pieces, and half a dozen tablespoonfuls 
of white wine. Let all soak together for two hours, then transfer all to a baking- 
pan, with some scraps of pork rind placed at the bottom of the pan, and put this in 
the oven to cook. Place the fillets on a dish, pour in the pan one gill of hot broth, 
allow it to come to the boil, strain it over the fillets and serve with poivrade sauce 
separately. 

Gibelotte of Hare. 

Proceed the same way as for civet of hare, French style, replacing the red wine 
with one pint of white broth, and adding twelve whole mushrooms five minutes before 
serving. 

Hare Pie. 

Skin a hare and cut into joints, putting the blood into a basin, or, if more conven- 
ient, cut into half-joints. Chop fine one pound of veal and mix it with an equal 
quantity of sausage meat; chop two shallots, mix them with some finely-minced pars- 
ley or thyme, and dust over with salt and pepper; chop also some veal bones into very 
small pieces. Put a layer of the hare meat at the bottom of the pie-dish, then a layer 
of the sausage and veal mince, sprinkle over with the parsley and shallot, and cover 
the whole with some bacon. When the dish is nearly full add the blood and a half-pint 
of Madeira, put three bay leaves on the top, cover over with the lid, seal it hermeti- 
cally with paste made of flour and water and bake in a slow oven for ten hours. It is 
usually put in a baker's oven and left there for the night. The veal bones should be 
added to the meat and put about it indiscriminately.

Roasted Hare with Cream Sauce. 



Prepare a hare and if it is an old one lard it with fine strips of bacon. Boil the 
liver, chop it and mix half of it with enough chopped beef-suet, herbs, salt, pepper 
and grated nutmeg to taste, and bind the whole together with beaten egg. Stuff the 
hare with the mixture, sew it up and fix it in front of a clear fire, putting it some dis- 
tance off at first and afterwards bringing it closer. Baste with three pints of milk 
until half cooked and then finish with butter. Prepare the following sauce for it : 
Pour the milk with which the hare was first basted into a saucepan, put in a bunch of 
sweet herbs, let it stew within twenty minutes of the hare being cooked, and then 
strain it. 

Salmis of Hare. 

Clean and skin a hare, split it down the back and cut off all the fillets with their 
bones attached. Put the remainder of the hare into a saucepan with a rich sauce and 
stew until the meat will easily leave the bones; stew also the liver together with a 
little calf's liver and pound them in a mortar with butter and seasoning; also pound 
the stewed flesh of the hare with more seasoning and butter, keeping them separate 
from the liver. Put two breakfast cupfuls of stale breadcrumbs into a basin, pour 
over one pint of boiling cream, throw in a raw onion and a bay leaf and let it get 
cold. Take out the onion and bay leaf and work in a large piece of butter, a season- 
ing of white pepper, mace and salt. Mix half of this with the liver and the other half 
with the pounded hare meat. Place these two mixtures in alternate layers in a mould 
and steam them for an hour. Arrange the cutlets on a dish with one-half pound of 
melted butter poured over, allow them to soak, spread them out to cool, fry in butter, 
turn the contents of the mould out onto a dish and arrange the cutlets round, lean- 
ing them against it. Then pour around a good rich sauce made from truffles, red 
wine and any bones of hare not previously used, season all to taste and thicken with 
roux. 

Stewed Hare. 

Skin and wash a hare, draw off all the blood and cut into halves through the 
middle. Lard the hare as thickly as possible and put it into a saucepan covered at 
the bottom with slices of bacon. Place a large bunch of parsley in a muslin bag with 
a few bay leaves, a little thyme, a clove, sweet basil, spices and add with four onions, 
two or three carrots, two calf's feet and a few pieces of bacon cut from the breast; 
dust over a little salt and pepper and add one pint of white wine and two tablespoon- 
fuls of broth. Place a round of well-buttered paper over the hare to keep it from 
burning or becoming dry, place the lid on the saucepan, seal hermetically by luting 
the rim and edge with flour and water paste, and cook for three hours at the side of 
the fire and very gently. Take off the lid, remove the hare, drain and put it on a 



GAME. 353 

dish. Skim the liquor and pass it through a sieve. Place a little butter and flour in 
a saucepan and when it is of a light color add the liquor from the hare, boil it up, 
serve with the hare, but not poured over it. 

Timbales of Hare. 

Trim off all the skin of some cold cooked hare, chop the flesh, place it in a 
mortar and pound till smooth; mix it with one-third of its quantity of grated bread- 
crumbs, a little finely-chopped parsley and pepper and salt to taste. Whisk the 
whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, stir them in with the mixture and add a few drops 
of clear gravy to bring all to a proper consistence. Butter some small timbale 
moulds, fill them with the mixture, place them in a stewpan with boiling water to 
three-fourths of their height, and steam for about half an hour. Warm a little 
rich gravy and mix it with one tablespoonful of claret. When ready turn the 
timbales out onto a hot dish, pour round the gravy, and serve. 

Ballotines of Larks. 

Bone the required quantity of larks, fill them with chicken forcemeat, place a 
truffle turned to a ball shape into each bird, and fold them round it. Tie each lark 
up in a small cloth and braise it in Madeira and mirepoix. Place a bed of mashed 
potatoes on a hot dish, take the cloth off the larks, arrange them over the center of 
the bed, reduce some Spanish sauce with essence of lark, pour it over the larks, and 
serve. 

Broiled Larks. 

Truss and prepare the required quantity of larks; brush over with beaten eggs, 
sprinkle with plenty of breadcrumbs, place them on a gridiron, and broil over a very 
clear fire. Lay some slices of bread on a hot dish, dress the larks on them, pour a 
little rich brown gravy around, and serve. 

Larks in Cases. 

Pluck, singe, draw, and bone the larks; stuff each bird with a mixture composed 
of three parts minced white flesh of cooked chicken and one part ham and raw bacon 
seasoned with chopped sage, salt and pepper, and a small quantity of pounded mace. 
Butter as many paper cases as there are birds, spread a layer of the same forcemeat 
in each, place the birds in the cases, place a slice of bacon over each, and bake in a 
moderate oven. When it is cooked remove the bacon, pour a small quantity of rich 
gravy and a few drops of lemon juice in each case, stand them on a hot dish over 
which has been placed a fancy-edged dish-paper, garnish with parsley and cut lemons, 
and serve.

Lark Patties. 



Clean and bone the required quantity of larks, open and season them slightly; 
mix some forcemeat with a little chopped truffles, place a little in each lark and roll 
them up in a round shape. Line some small pie-moulds with short paste, put a layer 
of forcemeat at the bottom of each mould, then the larks, spread another thin layer 
of forcemeat on the top, cover the patties with short paste, pinching the edges to make 
them stick, egg the tops, then put a round of puff paste on each. Egg the tops once 
more and place the patties in a hot oven to bake for twenty minutes. When they are 
cooked cut off the covers and pour in one tablespoonful of Spanish sauce, reduced 
with a little essence of lark, place the covers on again, and serve while they are hot. 

Larks, Portuguese Style. 

Singe, clean, bone and cut the wings and legs off one dozen larks, place the 
bones and trimmings in a stewpan with a small carrot and a small onion cut into 
slices a bay leaf, a few cloves, a bunch of parsley, and cover the bottom of the stew- 
pan with some sherry wine; allow this to reduce, then moisten with good gravy; let 
all simmer gently for an hour, then strain it. Prepare a chicken forcemeat and place 
it in a biscuit bag, also have cooked a dozen small black truffles, as round as possible, 
and no larger than an olive. Stuff the larks with the forcemeat and put in the center of 
them a small round truffle, roll the larks very neatly and wrap each in a piece of 
muslin, and tie with a string. Put them into a stewpan with some bacon over the 
bottom, and pour in a little strong gravy as above, and bake them in a hot oven for 
thirty minutes. Meanwhile prepare and cook one dozen mushrooms, take half a pint 
of Spanish sauce and place it in a sautepan with the same quantity of tomato sauce, 
six tablespoonfuls of gravy and a little essence of lark, reduced to half-glaze. Shape 
the mushrooms with a plain round cutter, arrange them in a sautepan, unwrap and 
place one on each lark, sticking them with the remains of the chicken forcemeat, 
cover and place in the oven for a few minutes. Sauce them, dress them on a plain 
border made from chicken forcemeat or mashed potatoes, and pile in the center some 
rice cooked with white stock. Put a little of the sauce over the larks, and serve the 
remainder in a sauceboat. 

Roasted Larks. 

Clean and prepare the larks, tie them up in thin slices of fat bacon and then in 
vine leaves, and roast in front of a clear fire, basting frequently with butter and turning 
the spit very rapidly. Serve hot. 

Lark Scallops on a Croustade. 

Cut the fillets from about fifteen larks; place them in a sautepan with a piece of 
butter, dust with salt and pepper and fry them. When cooked, drain and let them 



GAME. 355 

cool. Slice the same quantity of truffles as there are larks. Reduce some partridge 
chaurroid sauce with a little essence of larks and mix it with the cooked fillets of 
larks and the sliced truffles. Prepare a fried bread croustade, put it on a hot dish, ar- 
range the scollops on it in the shape of a pyramid, garnish the dish with croutons of 
aspic jelly, and serve. 

Broiled Ortolans in Papers. 

Rub with melted butter or salad oil as many sheets of paper as there are birds 
and cut them just large enough to double over the birds and turn in all round the 
edges like a hem in order to preserve the fat and trail while the birds are being 
cooked. Carefully pluck and singe the birds, cut off the beaks and claws, skin the 
heads and necks and wipe them with a clean cloth; twist the feet, lay the heads close 
to the sides of the birds and inclose in the paper. Place them on a gridiron over a 
very slow fire and broil for about five minutes or until they swim in their own fat. 
Serve them at once in the papers on a plate covered with watercress. The papers 
are not to be removed till just before eating the birds. 

Fried Ortolans. 

Draw and singe twenty-four ortolans, put them in a fryingpan with some melted 
bacon and two bay leaves sprinkled over with salt and pepper and fry over a brisk 
fire, turning them frequently. Strain off the fat, add some vinegar and some melted 
glaze and reduce the liquor quickly over a brisk fire. Take out the bay leaves, add 
a salpicon of lean smoked ham steeped in water and a little Spanish sauce reduced 
with white wine and warm the ham without boiling the liquor. Arrange the birds in 
a pile in the center of a dish, pour the sauce over, and serve with a garnish of small 
quenelles. 

Ortolans in Cases. 

Pluck, draw, and singe one dozen ortolans, and put them into small cases masked 
with Perigueux sauce, putting their heads through a hole cut for the purpose. Place 
them in a quick oven for a few minutes, or they may be salamandered, and when they 
are done, damp them with a little more of the perigueux, and serve. Care must be 
taken in drawing them to take out their gizzards. 

Ortolan Patties. 

Make six patties of tart paste in fluted moulds made with hinges so that they 
will open to let out the patty crusts when done ; fill them with flour and bake. When 
set take them out of the moulds and let them get cold. Place at the bottom of each 
one tablespoonful of royal salpicon, and then place in each patty two well picked, 
fine, fat, raw, seasoned ortolans, covered with a thin slice of bacon ; lay them on a 



356 GAME. 

small baking pan, place in a moderate oven and bake for fifteen minutes. Remove 
from the oven, take off the lard from the birds, moisten each patty with two table- 
spoonfuls of hot Madeira sauce, and serve on a hot dish with a folded napkin placed 
over it. 

Ortolans, Perigordine. 

Prepare the birds as for roasting, cover them with slices of fat bacon, put them 
in a saucepan, set in the bain-marie, add a little stock mixed with lemon juice, baste 
them with this, and cook them. Scoop out the center from as many truffles as there 
are birds, put them into a saucepan with sufficient champagne to boil them in, take 
them out when done and stuff with a little game puree. Put them into the saucepan 
with the ortolans, warm them all up for a few seconds, arrange them on a dish, and 
serve with a little of the sauce to moisten them. 

Ortolans, Provincial Style. 

Procure as many large truffles as there are birds to be cooked and make some 
French forcemeat. Remove the feet and heads from the birds and season well with 
salt and pepper; lay the birds on their backs on the truffles, put them in a deep stew- ' 
pan with two gills of red wine and about the same quantity of clear veal stock and 
cover with slices of bacon; coyer and stew slowly. When they are cooked remove 
the birds and truffles and keep them hot; strain the sauce through a fine sieve, skim 
off all the fat, pour it into a small, clean stewpan and boil till reduced to half its 
original quantity. Mix with the sauce one breakfast cupful of brown Spanish sauce 
and boil it again until somewhat reduced. Put some pieces of toast on a hot dish, 
pour the sauce over, put the birds and truffles on them, and serve. 

Roasted Ortolans. 

Pluck and singe one dozen ortolans, make a hole in the sides and remove the 
gizzards, but do not draw them. Stuff the heads into the holes, wrap them round 
with thin slices of fat bacon and put them in the oven to roast. Let them remain for 
ten or twelve minutes, sprinkle over with salt, arrange them on a dish on croutons of 
fried bread, and serve. They may be wrapped in vine leaves (freshly gathered) if 
preferred instead of the bacon, which destroys the delicate flavor to a certain extent. 
A rich sauce should be served with them. 

Boiled Partridges With Cream Sauce. 

Pluck, singe and draw six birds without breaking ' the entrails, wipe them with a 
wet towel and put them in a pan with sufficient boiling water to cover; add one table- 
spoonful of salt and boil them slowly for fifteen minutes. Meanwhile put one-half 
pint of thick cream into a saucepan set in a pan of boiling water, add to it one table- 
spoonful of butter and one-fourth saltspoonful of white pepper, and stir one way till 



GAME. 357 

the butter is melted, then leave the sauce where it will keep hot. When the par- 
tridges are done put them on a hot dish, dry them with a soft cloth, pour the cream 
sauce over, and serve them hot, garnished with sprigs of parsley. 

Braised Partridges. 

Singe, draw and truss three partridges as for boiling, put them in a stewpan with 
a slice of chopped fat bacon, and a bunch or faggot of sweet herbs and fry them till 
nicely colored all over; then pour in a little wine, put the lid on the stewpan with a 
few hot ashes on it, and let them braise gently. When nearly done put in with the 
partridges one-half pound of ham, cut in dice, and four large cloves of garlic that have 
been boiled in plenty of water; sprinkle a little Spanish red pepper over, and continue 
cooking for about fifteen minutes. When done take the partridges out, drain, remove 
the strings, put them on a hot dish, and garnish around with the garlic and ham; 
take the sweet herbs out of the cooking stock, skim the fat off, thicken it with a little 
brown sauce, pour it over the partridges, and serve. 

Braised Partridges and Cabbage. 

Truss a couple of old partridges as for boiled chickens. Put them in a sautepan 
and brown them slightly over a brisk fire. Cut some. bacon and two onions into dice, 
put them in a braising pan with the partridges, surround them with stock and braise 
till three parts done. Wash thoroughly a young cabbage, then blanch, drain, and 
dry it; put it in with the partridges, and finish cooking them together. When cooked 
make a bed of the cabbage on a hot dish and put the patridges on it with the pieces 
of bacon around. Strain the cooking liquor through a fine hair sieve, boil it until 
reduced, keeping the partridges hot at the same time. When ready pour the sauce 
round, and serve. 

Braised Partridges, Financiere. 

Singe, draw, wipe and truss two partridges with their wings inside. Lay a piece 
of pork rind in a saucepan, adding one carrot and one onion, both cut in slices, two 
bay leaves, one sprig of thyme, and the two partridges, seasoning with a little salt and 
pepper. When the birds have assumed a good golden color on the hot stove, moisten 
with one-half pint of broth; put the saucepan in the oven and cook for twenty minutes 
longer. Dress them on a dish, untruss, pour over one-half pint of hot financiere 
sauce, and serve. The gravy from the partridges can be utilized for making the 
financiere sauce. 

Braised Partridges, Perigueux. 

Clean three partridges and truss them as for boiling. Fasten some thin slices of 
fat bacon round them, put them in a stewpan with three-fourths of a pint of mirepoix 
and one-fourth pint of essence of truffles, put a sheet of buttered paper over them, 



358 GAME. 

stand the stewpan over a slow fire and let the contents simmer till the partridges are 
done. Cut a three-sided block of bread three inches high, two and one-half inches at 
the base and one and one-half inches at the top, fry it, and then fix it in the middle 
of a dish with a paste prepared with a little flour and white of egg. Drain the par- 
tridges when cooked and place one on each side of the bread. Shape three large 
partridge forcemeat quenelles like pears and put one between each bird; mix some 
essence of partridge with perigueux sauce, pour it over the birds, put a large truffle 
on top of the bread, fill a sauceboat with the same sauce, and serve it with the par- 
tridges. 

Braised Partridges with Truffles.

Chop three tender partridges each in halves lengthwise, sprinkle salt and pepper 
over them, dip them in warmed butter, then in breadcrumbs, put them on a gridiron 
and broil over a clear slow fire, turn them when done on one side and finish the other. 
When cooked put the partridges on a hot dish, pour over some Colbert sauce, and 
serve. 

Chartreuse of Partridges. 

Cut a cabbage into quarters, wash it well, plunge it into boiling water, then soak 
it in cold water for two hours. Drain and squeeze all the water out of the cabbage, 
cut the stalks out, tie the pieces together, and put them in a stewpan with two or 
three slices of streaky bacon previously blanched; pour some general stock, mixed 
with essence of partridge, over it, put in some clarified fat, and finish as described 
for Cabbage for Garnishing. Cut some carrots and turnips into slices two inches long 
with a vegetable cutter, and cook them separately, as described for Garnishes. Put a 
round of paper at the bottom of a plain entree-mould that has been buttered, garnish 
it with pieces of carrot and turnip, and put a layer of cabbage in the mould. Cut up 



GAME. 359 

three roast partridges, put four fillets on the cabbage, then put another layer of the 
cabbage on them; continue with alternate layers of partridge and cabbage till the 
mould is full. Stand the mould in a bain-marie till the contents are warm. When 
ready to serve turn the chartreuse onto an entree dish, and arrange alternately round 
the base some rounds of carrots and turnips, with a string bean between each. Put 
some rings of turnip round the top of the chartreuse and a Brussels sprout in each. 
Make a sort of cup or vase with a carrot, fill it with string beans, and place it in the 
center. Reduce some Spanish sauce with essence of partridge, fill a sauceboat with it, 
and serve with the chartreuse. 

Partridge Croustades. 

Truss eight partridges as for braising, fasten a thin slice of bacon on each one, 
put them in a stewpan with some mirepoix, stand them over a slow fire and simmer 
till done. Prepare fourteen truffles, eight cockscombs, and eight large crayfish as 
for garnish. Cut an oval shaped piece of bread, fry it, put it on a dish, and place a 
block of fried bread in the center. Drain the partridges when cooked, arrange them, 
necks downward, against the block of bread, and put a crayfish between each. Stick 
a silver skewer garnished with cockscombs and truffles in each bird, so as to form a 
circle, and place the remaining truffles inside the circle. Fill a silver casserole with 
a financiere garnishing that has had some Spanish sauce reduced with essence of 
partridge mixed with it, and serve. 

Fillets of Partridges, Financiere. 

Trim and lard the fillets of six partridges with thin strips of bacon, put them in 
a sautepan with a little melted glaze and cook them. Make a croustade of paste 
the same size as the dish on which the fillets are to be served and two inches deep. 
Prepare a financiere garnishing of foies gras, truffles, mushrooms, cockscombs and 
kernels and chicken forcemeat quenelles mixed in a financiere sauce. Trim the 
minion fillets into scallops and mix them in the garnishing, half of which should be

Cut the fillets off the breasts of some partridges, making four fillets of each 
breast, trim them to a nice shape, lay them in a thickly buttered baking tin, dust 
over with salt and cover with a sheet of buttered paper. Slightly roast the birds 
from which the fillets have been removed, cut them into small pieces, put them in a 
saucepan with a few trimmings of ham, two or three cloves and peppercorns, a bunch 
of sweet herbs, two shallots, salt to taste and a sufficient quantity of clear stock to 
cover; one wineglassful of claret may also be added if liked. Boil the whole over a 
slow fire for from one and a half to two hours. Stir one ounce of butter and one- 
half ounce of flour in a stewpan over the fire. Skim and strain the liquor from the 
birds and stir it in gradually with the butter and flour; put in a few button mush- 
rooms and truffles and boil them gently until cooked. Put the fillets in the oven and 
bake them till just set. When the truffles and mushrooms are cooked take them out

round the edge of the dish, place a cover of the paste on the top and press them to- 
gether; dip a pastebrush in beaten egg, brush the top of the pie over with it and 
make a small hole in the center. Put it in a hot oven with a piece of paper on top to 
prevent its browning too much, and bake it for an hour. Serve either hot or cold. 



Partridges, Princess Beatrice Style. 

Prepare three partridges, truss them for roasting, and lard their breasts with thin 
strips of fat smoked bacon. The larding can be done in a fancy design. Lay the 
birds in a basin with some verjuice and leave them for an hour or two. When ready, 
drain and wipe them very carefully on a dry cloth without disturbing the pattern of 
the larding. Butter some sheets of broiling-paper, wrap each bird separately in it 
and roast them in the oven, keeping them well basted. In about half an hour re- 
move the paper and brown the birds. Lay them on a hot dish garnished with water- 
cress, and serve with a clear sauce. 



GAME. 361 

Puree of Partridge. 

Empty and clean three partidges, put them in a braisingpan with a little game 
broth and braise them. When done let them cool. Strain the cooking liquor through 
a fine hair-sieve, skim off all the fat, put it in a stewpan with double its quantity of 
veloute sauce and boil till reduced to the thickness of thick supreme sauce. Take all 
the meat from the partridges when cold, chop it, put it in a mortar and pound, pouring

chop three large truffles, put them in with the fat, also put in ten sliced truffles, pour 
in one quart of white sauce, and boil it until thickly reduced, keeping it well stirred 
at the same time. Move the pan to the side of the fire, stir in quickly the beaten 
yolks of two eggs, and pour it on the plate. When the truffle mixture is cold, stuff 
the partridges with it, then hang them up and leave them for a few days, so as to be 
well flavored with the truffles. When ready for cooking, wrap the birds separately in 
sheets of buttered paper, fix them on a roasting pan and roast them in a hot oven for 
half an hour. Pour two quarts of white sauce into a saucepan with one pint of veal 
broth, put it over the fire, and when it boils add a few thinly-sliced French truffles, 
and a scant teaspoonful of sugar. Stir and boil it until thickly reduced, then mix in

forcemeat and stuff the partridges with it ; truss, lay them in a roastingpan, spread 
with butter and set the pan in the oven, basting the birds occasionally with their own 
butter. When the birds are cooked (they will take from twenty to twenty-five min- 
utes, according to their size), sprinkle salt over and put them on a hot dish. Mix a 
little gravy in the drippings, skim off the fat, and boil it till reduced to half its orig- 
inal quantity, then strain it through a fine hair-sieve. Garnish the partridges with 
slices of lemon, and serve them with the sauce in a sauceboat 

Salmis of Partridges. 

Truss three perfectly fresh partridges as for roasting, put them in a sautepan with 
a little butter, and brown them over a brisk fire. Leave them till half cold, then cut 
the wings and legs off and separate the breasts; pare and trim each piece. Put the 
carcasses, trimmings, and some fat bacon in a stewpan, and with them prepare a little 
rich gravy. Fry the livers in butter, then put them in a mortar and pound them, add 
them to some brown sauce, stir it over the fire till hot, then skim and pass it through 
a fine hair-sieve. Put it again in the saucepan, strain the gravy in, turn the legs of 
the partridges in, and warm them. Arrange the legs on a hot dish, put the wings on

rooms. Cook for fifteen minutes longer, then serve with six croutons of bread round 
the dish for garnish. 

Stewed Partridges. 

Procure three partridges, .old ones will do, lard them, and truss them as for boil- 
ing. Line a stewpan with slices of fat bacon, put in the parti idges, breasts down- 
wards, with a slice of lean veal, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a few chopped savory 
vegetables; pour in a teacupful each of gravy and white wine. Let all cook over a 
slow fire for an hour and a half; then place the partridges on a hot dish, strain their 
cooking liquor over them, garnish with cut lemons and fried parsley, and serve. 

Stewed Partridges, Chipolata.

all is tender. Thicken the sauce, turn the whole onto a dish, and serve with croutons 
of fried bread. 

Stewed Partridges, Montmorency. 

Truss some young partridges as for stewed partridges, Spanish style. Dip the 
breasts into boiling water to make them firm, then plunge them into cold water, and 
lard them with bacon. Put some slices of fat bacon at the bottom of the stewpan, 
put the partridges in, put some more rashers of fat bacon on the top of them, and 
moisten to half their height with fowl broth. Stand the pan over a brisk fire for a 
few minutes, then move to the side and cook slowly for twenty minutes. Glaze, take 
them out, drain, and glaze again. Put them on a hot dish, and serve with a Dutch 
sauce. 

Stewed Partridges, Spanish Style. 

Pluck two or three partridges carefully so as not to injure the skin, clean them, 
cut off the sinew that is under the joints of the legs, and skewer the legs up towards 
the breast. Fill a needle with packthread, run it through the stump of the right 
wing, then through the thick joint of the leg, next across the body, and then again 
through the other stump; then tighten the packthread and fasten the knot. Run the 
needle through from the back to the side beneath the leg, and then above the pinion 
below the breast, so as to perforate the breast bone, let the needle come out from the 
part parallel to that where it was first introduced, then through the side to the 
back, and then fasten the packthread. Care should be taken to give the birds as nice 
a shape as possible. Put some slices of bacon at the bottom of a large stewpan, put

dish, pour over some Spanish sauce in which has been mixed a little glaze, and serve. 

How to Truss Pheasants, Etc. 

Pheasants are trussed in the same manner as fowls, and so are partridges and 
grouse, with the exception that, like all small wild fowl, the legs are crossed and the 
heads skinned and threaded on skewers through the pinions; pigeons and other birds 
of a similar size are trussed in such a manner as to make the breasts plump out. 

Snipe and woodcock are trussed in France by thrusting the long beak through 
the body and fastening the wings under the thighs; woodcocks are sometimes trussed 
with the head "hooded," as it is called, under the skin of the breast. 

Braised Pheasant. 

, Prepare and truss a pheasant as for boiling. Line a stewpan with slices of fat 
bacon and one or two thick slices of veal, put in the bird, season it well with salt

and pepper, add a few sweet herbs, cover it with more slices of bacon and veal, cover 
the stewpan down perfectly air-tight, and put it in a moderate oven and cook for two 
hours. When done place it on a hot dish, strain over it some of the gravy that will 
have run from it while cooking, garnish it with sliced lemons, and serve. 

Braised Pheasant, Financiere. 

Prepare and braise two pheasants. Then prepare a financiere, garnishing with 
foies gras, cockscombs, truffles and pheasant forcemeat quenelles, and mix with them 
some financiere sauce. Put a block of fried bread in the center of a dish, sticking it 
onto the dish with the white of egg and flour paste; arrange the pheasants, leaning 
against each end of the bread, put the garnishing in the dish in order, put a row of 
pheasant forcemeat quenelles between each pheasant, a cooked and larded sweetbread 
each side of the bread, with cooked truffles on each. Put four crayfish and some 
cockscombs in the spaces, and put another larded and sweetbread on top of the bread. 
Get five silver attelettes and garnish them with cockscombs, truffles and crayfish, stick 
them in the pheasants and sweetbreads, and serve with a sauceboatful of financiere 
sauce that has been reduced with essence of pheasant. 

Broiled Pheasant. 

Cut the bird into four pieces and fry them in lard; when nicely browned all over 
and half done through, take them from the fire, drain the lard from them, brush over 
with beaten egg, roll them in a paper of breadcrumbs mixed with salt and cayenne, 
put them on a hot well-greased gridiron and broil them for ten minutes over a clear 
fire. 

Fillets of Pheasants, Maintenon. 

Take the fillets from two large young pheasants and cut each in two slices, beat 
them lightly, season with salt and pepper, put them into a sautepan with two table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil and saute them over a quick fire, keeping them rather under- 
done. When cooked, take the fillets out and drain them. Put two chopped onions 
in the sautepan and fry them till lightly browned, adding more oil if necessary; then 
mix in two tablespoonfuls each of chopped mushrooms and chopped parsley and one 
pint of white sauce seasoning with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg and one-half tea- 
spoonful of sugar. Bail the sauce till thickly reduced, stirring it at the same time; 
put the fillets in the sauce, move it away from the fire and leave it till cold. Cut as 
many pieces of white paper as there are fillets into heart-shaped pieces; put a fillet 
on each with the sauce divided equally and wrap the papers over, twisting them well 
at the ends. Broil the fillets over a clear, but slow fire. When cooked put them on 
a hot dish, leaving them in their papers, and serve with a sauceboatful of rich gravy.

brown the venison. If a frothy appearance is desired, dredge the meat with flour, 
and baste it with butter before browning it. Serve very hot with red currant jelly. 

Baked Saddle of Venison. 

The saddle of venison is the double loin. Have the ribs cut off close to use 
for soup, stew or pastry. Wipe all the hairs off with a soft cloth dampened in warm 
water, tie thickly-buttered paper over the upper part of the saddle, lay it on a rack 
in a bakingpan and quickly brown the joint in a hot oven; then remove the paper 
and season with salt and pepper. Put into the drippingpan one teaspoonful each of

main in this for four hours, turning it frequently; take it out, allow it to drain, lard 
the fillets with bacon, place it in a braisingpan and moisten to half the height of the 
meat with broth and a small quantity of its marinade. Braise it on a moderate fire 
and baste frequently. Dish it up, garnish with a pile of round truffles and two 
mushrooms stuffed along the sides, and a pile of sourkraut at each end. Pour over 
a little brown sauce that has been prepared with the meat, and serve the balance of 
the sauce in a sauceboat.

remove the sinews from the surface and lard it with a larding-needle, tying it three 
times round. Put into "a roastingpan one sliced onion and one sliced carrot, then put 
in the saddle, seasoning with one pinch of salt; spread over one-half ounce of butter 
and stand it in a brisk oven for fifty minutes, basting it frequently with its own 
gravy. Untie before lifting it from the pan, and arrange it on a hot dish. Pour into 
the pan one wineglassful of Madeira wine and one gill of white broth, and let it come 
to a boil on the stove. Skim off the fat, strain the lean part over the saddle, and 
serve it with one-half pint of hot currant jelly sauce in a sauceboat. 

Roasted Shoulder of Venison, French Style. 

Bone and stuff a shoulder of venison, lard it, and either roast or bake it, protect- 
ing the lardoons with several thicknesses of buttered paper. If the meat is basted 
while it is being cooked, take care not to baste the larded part, as that would soften 
the lardoons. When the venison is nearly done season it with salt and cayenne,

without breaking the entrails and wipe them with a wet cloth; rub them all over with 
cold butter, dredge them with flour and roast them for about twenty minutes. Care- 
fully preserve all the gravy that flows from them, and when nearly done sprinkle 
them with salt and pepper. Serve at once with their gravy and red currant jelly, or 
with orange essence made as follows: Chop very finely two peeled onions or one 
shallot, grate the yellow rind of a large orange and chop one ounce of ham or bacon 
very fine; put these ingredients into a small saucepan, add to them a small sprink- 
ling of salt and pepper, one-half pint of gravy from roasted wild fowl, one gill of

a buttered sautepan, pour in sufficient white stock to cover them, and boil gently for 
a few minutes. Chop the flesh off the legs and the trails, put it in a mortar, pound 
and pass through a fine hair-sieve. Put the pounded meat in a saucepan with one and 
one-half breakfast cupfuls of game-sauce (which can be made from the bones of the 
birds) and boil it till thick, move the sauce to the side of the fire and stir in thebeaten 
yolks of two eggs. Arrange the fillets of woodcocks in a circle on a hot dish, alter- 
nating each with a crouton of fried bread, pour the sauce in the middle of the dish, 
and serve. 

Fillets of Woodcock on Toast. 

Separate the fillets from the bones of some woodcocks, trim them neatly, season 
with salt and pepper, and brush over with warmed butter. Chop the trails of the 
birds and mix them with some chopped parsley, shallots and scraped bacon, and 
season the mixture with salt and pepper. Cut some crusts of bread longer than the 
fillets, make some deep slits down the edges, fry them in butter, then scoop out the 
crumb. Fill the crusts with the chopped trail mixture and bake them. Put the fillets 
of woodcocks in a fryingpan with some butter and fry them. Mix some meat glaze 
with some stock that should have been made with the pounded carcass of the birds. 
When cooked place the crusts on a hot dish, put a fillet on each crust, and serve them 
with the sauce in a sauceboat. 

Fillets of Woodcock with Truffle Puree. 

Separate the fillets from the bones of the birds, trim, and put them in a frying- 
pan, season with a little salt and pepper, and baste with a little warmed butter. Stud 
each of the minion fillets with a small square of truffle, lay them in a bakingdish 
with a small lump of butter, cover with a sheet of buttered paper, and bake in the 
oven. Fry the large fillets over a moderate fire. Fix a croustade in the center of a 
hot dish and fill it with truffle puree. Arrange the large fillets when cooked in a 
circle round the croustade, then place the minion fillets around them. Pour over the 
fillets some essence of woodcocks that have been mixed with a small quantity of half 
glaze, and serve then. 

Woodcocks in Croustades. 

Singe and bone some woodcocks and sprinkle them inwardly with pepper and 
salt. Break the back and bones into small pieces, put them in a stewpan with a lump 
of butter, and fry them over a clear fire till browned, and then cover them with white 
wine and broth and let simmer for twenty minutes. Strain the liquor off the bones 
into another stewpan, boil it till reduced to half glaze, then thicken it with two or 
three tablespoonfuls of sauce. Put the trails of the woodcocks and five or six 
chickens' livers in a fryingpan with some bacon fat and fry them quickly; add salt 
and pepper, leave till cool, then pound them in a mortar with half their quantity of

chopped bacon and the same of panada. Mix four tablespoonfuls of chopped raw 
truffles with the above mixture and stuff the birds with it, roll one bird to a round 
shape and the remainder to an oval shape, fastening them securely with twine. Place 
two or three rashers of bacon and some sliced vegetables, such as carrots, turnips and 
onions, at the bottom of a stewpan, put in the birds, sprinkle a little salt over them, 
pour in to half their height some white wine and broth mixed in equal quantities, put 
the lid on the pan and braise the birds. Cut as many small croustades of bread as 
there are birds, shaping one round and the rest oval, make a cut round on the upper 
surface with the point of a knife, and fry them in fat till nicely browned. When 
done, drain, scoop them out, and spread a thin layer of game quenelle forcemeat all 
over the insides. Put the croustades in the oven and bake them till the forcemeat 
has set. When done, fit the birds in the bread cases and pour the sauce over them. 
Arrange the croustades on an ornamental dish-paper that has been placed on a hot 
dish, putting the oval-shaped ones all round and the round one in the center, and 
serve while hot. 



Woodcocks, Minute Style. 



Put three ounces of butter in a small fryingpan over a good fire, add some shred 
shallots, a little pepper and salt, and grated nutmeg; when the butter is quite hot put

When done, drain the birds, put them on a hot dish, strain the sauce over them, and 
serve. 

Roasted Woodcocks. 

Truss the required quantity of woodcocks without drawing them, fastening the 
legs close to the body with an iron skewer. Toast as many slices of bread as there 
are woodcocks. Roast the woodcocks in a good oven. Lay a slice of toast in a 
drippingpan under each bird to catch the trail, and let them roast for thirty minutes. 
They should be rather underdone. While they are roasting baste them with butter. 
When sufficiently cooked lay the pieces of toast on a hot dish and put one of the 
birds on each, pour a little beef gravy in the dish, and serve some more in a sauce 
tureen. Garnish the dish with thin slices of lemon and watercress. 



GAME. 383 

Salmi of Woodcock. 

Split three woodcocks lengthwise down the back, then divide them into joints, 
and lay them aside on a dish. Bruise the livers and trails of the birds, lay them on 
the dish with the birds, strew two tablespoonfuls of finely-minced lemon peel over, 
and dust with salt, white pepper, a little cayenne, grated nutmeg, and two teaspoon- 
fuls of French mustard ; moisten with a wineglassful of white wine and the strained 
juice of four lemons. Put the dish in the oven, and turn the contents about occasion- 
ally so that they may be well seasoned. When very hot take the dish (which should 
be of silver) out of the oven, pour a few drops of olive oil over the salmis, stir it 
about a little, and serve while very hot. 

Broiled Woodhens. 

Draw the birds, and truss them with their legs tucked into the body ; singe, and 
split them into halves lengthwise, beat each piece lightly, season and brush them over 
with clarified butter, and coat them with breadcrumbs. Grease a gridiron, heat it, 
put the pieces of birds on it, and broil over a clear but moderate fire ; turn to

Cold Dishes. 

Tenderloin of Beef in Aspic. 

Trim well a small tenderloin of beef and make a deep incision down the thin 
side. Chop fine some lean veal, passing it through a fine hair-sieve, returning it to 
the mortar, and mix with an equal quantity of chopped beef suet and about a third 
that amount of panada; pound well together and season with salt, pepper and grated 
nutmeg, bind it together with beaten eggs, and mix in some truffles, beef tongue and 
whites of hard-boiled eggs, all cut into small slices. Stuff the tenderloin with the 
forcemeat; cover it first with slices of celery, then with cooked ham, and lastly with 
thin slices of fat bacon, and tie up. Place the beef in a braisingpan with two calves' 
feet and some stock, and stew the meat two or three hours and until tender over a 
slow fire. When cooked, take the beef out of the liquor and leave it until quite cold. 
Strain the liquor through a fine hair-sieve into a basin and leave it until it is set; 
strain off all fat, and rub it over with a cloth dipped in hot water to remove all traces 
of grease; clarify the liquor and pass through a silk sieve. Pour a small quantity of 
the liquor into a mould which will hold the tenderloin, and place on ice until thor- 
oughly set. Trim it at both ends, and cut some small pieces of hard-boiled eggs, 
tongue and truffles, which arrange in tasteful designs on the set jelly; pour in enough 
of the jelly stock to cover them, and allow it to become quite firm; then lay the 
tenderloin on the jelly, the top turned downward, and pour in the balance of the 
clarified liquor. When ready for serving, dip the mould into tepid water to loosen 
the jelly at the sides, wipe, and turn the contents onto a dish, garnishing to taste, 
and serve. 

Beef Tongue in Aspic Jelly. 

Trim off the roots of a skinned cold boiled tongue, either fresh or salted. Pack 
a half-gallon mould in ice, pour in a little warmed aspic jelly to cover the bottom to 
about one inch in depth, let it set, garnish with beet-root cut in various shapes, pour 
over a little more aspic to set them, place the tongue upside down on top, pour over 
one teacupful more of the jelly to fix the tongue in its place, then fill up the mould 
with jelly, and let it remain till set and quite firm. Turn it out onto a dish, garnish 
with parsley and pickles, and serve. Pickled beet-root should be used if possible. 

Aspic of Crayfish with Salad. 

Incrust a plain border mould in ice, and have prepared sufficient warm aspic jelly 
to fill it. Cut some truffles in halves and dip them in the jelly, also an equal number 

384 



COLD DISHES. 385 

of crayfish tails, and as each one is dipped stick them round the interior of the mould 
alternately. Chop up the meat from the claws and stir it into the jelly, pouring it 
immediately into the border mould. When cold, turn the border out onto a dish, 
after having dipped the mould for an instant in hot water. Fill the center of the 
border with shredded lettuce mixed with a thick mayonnaise, and pile this up so that 
the crayfish tails may be arranged around and also cover it in rows. The dish may 
be garnished with coarsely-chopped aspic and a few pieces placed on the top. 

Chicken Cutlets in Aspic. 

Cut off the fillets from two chickens, contise the minions or small fillets with 
truffles; put them all into a sautepan with a little butter, cover with paper, place a 
tin with a weight on the top of them to keep it flat, set the pan in the oven and cook 
without allowing them to take color. Remove to cool thoroughly, cut each large 
fillet first crosswise in halves and then lengthwise, and trim them in the shape 
of cutlets. Put into a saucepan one breakfast cupful of bechamel sauce to warm, 
and dissolve in it one teacupful of aspic jelly and a little chicken glaze; then add two 
tablespoonfuls of cream, mix well together, pour the mixture into a sieve over 
a basin packed in ice, stir it well until it thickens and mask all the cutlets with it 
before it is quite cold. Decorate the cutlets with various designs stamped out in 
cooked truffles and tongue, and trim the minion fillets. Pour a little of the jelly at 
the bottom of a mould packed in ice, arrange the minion fillets on it, cover over with 
a little more of the jelly, then place the cutlet-shaped pieces round the sides of the 
mould with the plain side inwards, and let them set; fill the mould up with the 
remainder of the jelly. Turn the jelly out on a dish and serve with a garnish 
of pieces of colored aspic intermixed with finely-chopped lettuce leaves. 

Chicken Fillets with Aspic Jelly. 

Take six good-sized chicken fillets, cut off the minion fillets and the thin skin of 
the larger ones, form these into equal shapes and put them into a sautepan with a 
little butter, giving them a slightly curved inclination when in the pan, pour over a 
little more butter, cover with paper, and cook them until quite done. Take the 
minion fillets, trim and contise them with a few small pieces of cooked beef tongue; 
put them into a sautepan with a little butter to cook, giving them a curved shape in 
the pan. In the meantime put a circular rice socle on a dish, mask it with Montpelier 
butter, and again on its center place a small socle two inches in diameter and three 
and a half inches in height, and mask this again with more Montpelier butter. Take 
the fillets out of the pan when done, place them on a strainer to drain, and put them 
when they are perfectly cold into hot chicken chaudfroid sauce, and then when they 
are cold put them on a dish on the larger rice socle, leaning against the smaller one,

with a truffle cut a quarter of an inch thick and of the size of the end of the fillets 
placed between them. Garnish the top of the socle with chopped aspic jelly, and 
serve. 



Game in Aspic Jelly. 



Put into a saucepan two pounds of . knuckle of veal, one lean slice of ham, 
a sprig of thyme, a couple of sprigs of parsley, half a dozen white peppercorns, one 
teaspoonful of salt and one shallot chopped up fine; pour over three pints of cold 
water, put the saucepan over the fire and simmer until the liquor is reduced to one 
pint, then strain it through a sieve and let it stand all night; next day remove all the 
fat. Put one ounce of isinglass into a basin, pour over it half a pint of cold water 
and let it soak three hours; then pour over it nearly one quart of boiling water, 
stirring it quickly until it is quite dissolved. Add the veal gravy which should be a 
stiff jelly, and when this also is dissolved, add a tablespoonful of sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls each of lemon juice and red currant jelly dissolved in a little cold water 
and strained through muslin. Keep stirring until all of these are thoroughly mixed, 
then strain through a jelly bag without squeezing or shaking. Have ready some hard- 
boiled eggs cut in slices, and some slices of cold roasted game sprinkled with a little 
salt. Wet the inside of a mould with cold water, pour in a thin layer of jelly, and 
when it stiffens, lay over it rings or slices of the egg overlapping one another like a 
chain, then pour in more jelly. When stiff enough, lay over slices of meat, then 
more jelly, and so on until the mould is quite full. Let it stand all night, and serve

Cut up three calves' feet, put them in a saucepan with two quarts of water and boil 
until the flesh leaves the bones. Singe, draw and clean a goose, put it into a saucepan, 
strain the liquor of the feet over it, put in two or three small onions, two bay leaves, 
a small bunch of thyme, basil and tarragon, a teaspoonful of bruised allspice, three or 
four cloves and half a lemon. Pour in more water to bring the liquor nearly to the 
height of the goose, put the lid on the stewpan and place it over the fire until the 
liquor boils ; then move it to the side and simmer until the goose is tender. When 
cooked, take the goose out of the saucepan, cut the meat off in slices, put the bones 
back into the liquor and boil for twenty minutes longer. Dust a small quantity of 
cayenne pepper into the liquor, give it a sharp flavor by adding lemon juice or vine- 
gar, strain through a jelly bag until clear and skim off all the fat. Pour a thin layer 
of the jelly into a rather shallow mould, leave it to set, then arrange on it pieces of 
beetroot cut in various shapes, the whites and yolks of hard-boiled eggs, sliced sep- 
arately, and a few green pickles. Pour carefully over these another thin layer of 
the jelly and leave it until firm. Arrange the slices of goose on top of the jelly, 
then pour in carefully the remainder. Pack the mould in ice or stand it in a cool

place until the contents are quite firm. Before serving, dip the mould in tepid 
water, wipe it, turn the jelly out onto a dish, and garnish with sprigs of parsley. 

Goose's Fat Liver in Aspic. 

Take the required number of fat livers and sprinkle over a little cayenne and 
salt and roll them into balls, mask them in bechamel sauce mixed in a little warmed 
aspic and decorate with slices of cooked black truffles cut in various ornamental 
designs. Put as many small moulds as there are balls of fat livers on ice, pour in a 
little warmed aspic jelly, let it set firm, put in the fat livers carefully so as not to dis- 
turb the decorations, fill up the moulds with more of the warmed aspic jelly, and let 
them set. Chop up fine a few lettuce leaves, mix them with oil and a slight sea 
soning of salt and pepper, put a layer of this on a dish, turn the contents of the 
moulds onto it, and serve with a garnish of shapes of colored aspic jelly put round 
the base of them. 

Cold Boiled Ham with Aspic Jelly. 

Choose a freshly smoked ham, trim off the end of the knuckle-bone, and after 
having soaked it for a few hours, boil it for three and a half hours, then take the 
kettle off the fire and let the ham remain for three-quarters of an hour in its liquor. 
Then remove, drain it, cut the thigh-bone short, wrap it tightly in a cloth, and let it 
cool. When ready to serve, remove the cloth, peel off the rind, excepting at the 
knuckle-end, trim it neatly, glaze, fix a ruffle on the knuckle-bone, place a white 
paper on a dish, set ihe ham on it and garnish the base with chopped aspic jelly and 
truffles. 

Lamb Cutlets in Aspic Jelly. 

Line the bottom of a stewpan with slices of bacon, onions and sliced carrots; 
trim a few cutlets, place them in the stewpan with a few cloves and peppercorns, half 
a blade of mace and two or three sprigs of parsley. Moisten with one wineglassful 
of sherry and sufficient clear stock to cover them, and leaving the lid on, simmer at 
the side of the fire. When tender leave the cutlets in their cooking liquor until they 
are half cold, then drain, place them between two plates and put a weight on the top. 
When quite cold trim the cutlets neatly, pour a layer of liquid aspic jelly into a 
vessel, and when it is set lay the cutlets upon it and cover with another layer of jelly, 
placing the pan on the ice to cool. After the jelly is quite cold and firm procure a 
tin cutter the shape of a cutlet and stamp the cutlets out with it, dipping it continu- 
ally in hot water. Boil until cooked some young green peas, then drain off the 
water, put a little jelly in with them and toss over the fire for a minute or two until 
well covered with it. Place a circle of chopped jelly on a dish, arrange the cutlets 
on it and pour the peas into the center. Garnish round the cutlets with croutons of 
aspfc jelly, and serve.

Aspic of Lobster. 



Cut some broiled lobster tails in slices, put them in a basin, dust with salt and 
pepper and squeeze in a little lemon juice. Put a thin layer of aspic jelly in a plain 
cylinder mould, garnish it with some hard-boiled eggs and lobster spawn and allow 
to set, then pour in another layer of aspic jelly one-fourth inch thick, spread a layer 
of montpellier butter one-fourth inch thick on a baking-sheet and on another baking- 
sheet spread another layer of lobster butter one-fourth inch thick and stand them 
both on ice. Cut both butters when quite firm with a round tin cutter to the size of 
the lobster slices. Arrange alternately in a circle the lobster slices and montpellier 
butter in the cylinder mould, pour in sufficient aspic to reach one-fourth of an inch 
above them and leave till set; then arrange a circle of lobster slices and lobster but- 
ter, dressing them the reverse to the first circle, pour in more aspic jelly, and when 
set continue the alternate circles of butter and lobster slices. When the mould is full 
cover it with a baking-sheet, pack it in ice and allow it to stand for two hours or 
more. Prepare a rice socle on a dish, mask it with lobster butter, turn the aspic out 
of the mould onto it, garnish with chopped jelly and croutons of jelly, and serve. 



Aspic of Oysters. 



Put three or four dozen large oysters into a stewpan with sufficient white wine or 
sherry to cover them and let cook gently until firm. Drain, trim, put them in a 
basin and season with a little salt and the juice of a lemon squeezed over. Set a 
mould in a box or tin of powdered ice and pour in a thin layer of warmed jelly. Let 
this set and then lay oysters symmetrically over it to within one-fourth inch of the 
edge all round. Pour over sufficient aspic to cover these and allow it to set and then 
repeat the layer of oysters until the mould is quite full, taking care that the aspic 
shall cover the last layer of oysters without overflowing. Allow this to stand for an 
hour in the ice and then dip the mould into hot water, removing quickly, and then 
turn out onto a cold dish. Garnish round with chopped aspic jelly or ornament with 
croutons of aspic in two or three colors of brown, red and yellow. Serve with a rich 
mayonnaise sauce. 

Aspic of Partridges. 

Cut the fillets off the breast of a couple of partridges, season each fillet with 
salt and pepper, lay them in a buttered bakingdish, cover them with a sheet of but- 
tered paper, and bake them. When the fillets are cooked put them between two 
plates with a weight on top and leave until cold. Roast the remainder of the birds, 
cut off all the flesh, chop it up, put it in a mortar with an equal quantity of chopped 
lean veal and the same each of butter and breadcrumbs that have been moistened 
with stock, and squeezed almost dry. Pound the mixture until quite smooth, then 
mix with it a small quantity of powdered sweet herbs, the white of one egg and yolks 



COLD DISHES. 389 

of two, and a small quantity of game stock. Season to taste with salt and pepper, 
and pass it through a fine hair-sieve. Butter a plain mould, turn the mixture into it, 
and steam for half an hour. Turn the forcemeat out of the mould and leave it until 
cold; then cut it into slices, and then the fillets into rounds of one size and thickness. 
Slice some cooked truffles, and some hard-boiled white of egg. Pour a thin layer of 
aspic liquid jelly into a plain mould, and leave it until it begins to set ; then arrange 
tastefully over it some of the above ingredients, pour in another layer of the jelly, 
then another layer of the meat, etc., and jelly again alternately until the mould is 
full. Place the mould in the ice-box or other cool place. When the jelly is firm 
turn the contents of the mould onto a dish, garnished with sprigs of well washed 
parsley, chopped aspic, and halves of hard-boiled eggs, and serve. 



Pigeons in Aspic Jelly. 



Wash and truss twelve pigeons, put them in a large saucepan with four pounds 
of the shank of veal, one onion that has been fried, one stick of celery, a bunch of 
sweet herbs, five or six cloves, two dozen peppercorns, and four and one-half quarts 
of water. Bring to a boil, and cook over a slow fire for three hours, adding at the 
end of the first hour two tablespoonfuls of salt. When ready, take the pigeons out 
carefully so as not to break them, and remove the strings. Place the pan over a 
quick fire and boil rapidly for forty minutes ; then strain the liquor through a fine 
hair-sieve, adding more seasoning if necessary. The liquor should be reduced to two 
and one-half quarts during boiling. Have two large moulds that will hold six 
pigeons each, pour a little liquor into each, and set them on ice to harden. Ar- 
range the birds on the set jelly, cover them with the liquor, which must be cooled but 
not hardened, and set the moulds in the ice-box for twelve hours. When ready to 
serve, dip the moulds in.tepid water, wipe them, and turn the contents on a cold dish. 
Garnish round the dish with chopped jelly slices of pickled beet-root, and some 
nicely picked sprays of parsley, and serve with a sauceboatful of Tartar sauce. 



Pike With Aspic Jelly. 



Thoroughly clean a pike, stuff it with some rather stiff fish forcemeat, sew it 
up, wrap it in a cloth and boil it in court bouillon and white wine. When cooked, 
leave the fish in its cooking liquor till cold, then take it out, remove the cloth, put it 
belly downwards on the drainer of the fish-kettle and leave it for some time to make 
sure of its being thoroughly drained. Trim the skin off the thickest part of its body, 
cut the flesh into slices, which put back again in shape, then glaze the fish with aspic 
jelly. Put the pike on an oval dish, propping it up on both sides with pieces of 
bread; surround it first with aspic jelly, then with hard-boiled eggs and small crou- 
tons of aspic jelly, arranged alternately. Garnish four attelette skewers, each with 
one truffle and one quenelle and one with a truffle and two crayfish, one of which 



390 COLD DISHES. 

should be smaller than the other and placed next the truffle. Stick the crayfish 
skewer in the middle of the pike's back and place the others two on each side. The 
dish containing the fish should be placed on an ornamented stand. 

Prawns in Aspic. 

Place in the bottom of a mould packed in ice, a little slightly warmed aspic 
jelly, decorate it with a little lobster coral, chopped white of hard-boiled eggs rubbed 
through a sieve and cover this over with some more of the jelly and prawns and fill 
up the mould with the jelly. When it has become firmly set, turn out onto a dish, 
garnish with wedge-shaped croutons of aspic jelly and small quantities of lettuce 
finely-chopped, surmounted by prawns in their shells. 

Aspic of Quails, Empress. 

Select half a dozen prime quails, or as many as may be required, truss and lard 
them as for roasting, place them in a stewpan containing four ounces of lean ham, 
half a dozen allspice and blade of mace, two or three bay leaves, a small carrot, a 
chopped onion and a small quantity of thyme and parsley; moisten with one pint of 
chicken stock and one wineglassful of sherry. Put on a tight-fitting cover and let 
them simmer gently until thoroughly cooked. When done, remove the stewpan from 
the stove and allow the quails to remain in the liquor until cold. Then remove and 
wipe them on a clean cloth ; cut each quail into halves and fill up the interior with 
foies gras, dip each half into reduced supreme sauce, and just before they com- 
mence to set, sprinkle over some chopped black truffles and tongue. When set, 
place them upon a flat dish, allowing plenty of room in between them, pour over a 
small quantity of liquid aspic jelly, repeating it until the quails have a thick coating 
over them ; place them upon the ice so as to get them thoroughly set. Just before 
they are wanted for the table, trim them round carefully with the point of a knife, dish 
them upon a cone of rice which has been previously prepared, garnish in the center 
with a garnishing of cockscombs and small truffles, place round the base croutons of 
aspic with chopped red aspic in between, and serve. 

Salmon with Aspic Jelly. 

Singe and cut into halves lengthwise two calves' feet, bone them, put them in a 
saucepan with some water and boil them gently over a slow fire. Pass the liquor of 
the feet through a fine hair-sieve into a basin, skim off the fat and leave it to settle. 
Boil a thick slice of salmon in some court bouillon and wine, and when cooked leave 
it until cold in its liquor. Put half of the calves' feet liquor into a saucepan with an 
equal quantity of the cooking liquor of the salmon, add some chopped vegetables, a 
few sprigs of parsley, a bunch of sweet herbs, one-half tablespoonful of cloves and 
peppercorns, two teacupfuls of vinegar, one-half teacupful of water and three well-

beaten whites of eggs. Stir the above mixture over the fire until it begins to boil, 
then move it to the edge of the fire and allow it to simmer until the jelly is clear. 
Strain the jelly through a jelly-bag into a basin and leave it until cold. Place the 
slices of salmon in a deep dish, distribute the jelly over it piling it in the center, and 
keep it in a cold temperature for from twenty-four to thirty hours. Garnish with jelly 
croutons, hard-boiled eggs cut in halves and yolks, and then serve. 

Aspic of Fillets of Soles. 

Fillet the soles, butter a baking-dish, put in the fillets, squeeze a little lemon juice 
over and season with salt and pepper; cover the fillets with a sheet of buttered paper 
and bake them for ten minutes in the oven. When cooked press the soles between 
two plates till cold. Put a layer of plain aspic jelly into a mould and leave till set. 
Cut the fillets of soles into small equal-sized rounds, and arrange them tastefully with 
some fillets of anchovies on the set aspic jelly. Sprinkle a little chopped parsley over 
them and cover with another layer of aspic jelly. Proceed in this manner, putting 
alternate layers of sole and aspic until the mould is full, then pack it in pounded ice. 
Turn the aspic out of the mould onto a dish, stick some slices of hard-boiled eggs on 
it with ravigote butter, and serve. 

Aspic of Trout. 

Clean a good-sized fresh trout, draw it by the gills, wipe it inwardly, stuff it with 
fish forcemeat and truss the head. Place it in a saucepan with sufficient broth to 
cover it and boil until it is done. Have in readiness a piece of fried bread of an oval 
shape and the length of the fish and place it on a dish of the same shape. Allow the 
trout to get cold, draining it on a sieve and wipe it well with a cloth; cover over the 
bread with paper, put the fish on the top, supporting it with butter, glaze it with half- 
set aspic jelly, surround it with chopped jelly, and decorate the edge of the jelly with 
croutons of jelly. Garnish the base of the support with halves of hard-boiled eggs, 
interspersed with small lettuces cut in halves, and serve with mayonnaise sauce in a 
sauceboat. 



Ballotines of Partridges. 



Bone the birds carefully, lay them open and dust them over with salt, pepper 
and powdered sweet herbs. Prepare a sufficient quantity of forcemeat with poultry 
livers, bacon, shallots and sweet herbs and season it to taste with salt and pepper. 
Line the inside of the birds with the forcemeat, then lay over that a few thin strips 
of cold tongue, blanched pistachio nuts and cooked truffles. Roll the birds up tightly, 
bind each one in a separate piece of cloth, put them into a stewpan, moisten to their 
height with stock, and boil gently for half an hour. Drain the birds, remove the 
cloths, bind them up again tightly, put them between two dishes with a moderate

COLD DISHES. 



weight on the top, and leave until quite cold. When ready unbind the birds, trim 
them neatly and brush them over with liquid glaze. Spread a folded napkin or a 
fancy dish-paper over a dish, lay the birds on it, garnish them with croutons of aspic 
jelly or a circle of chopped jelly, and serve. 



Boned Chicken Garnished With Jelly. 

Pluck a large chicken, singe and clean it thoroughly, bone it and remove the 
legs and wings. Cut the flesh from the wings into dice and chop the meat from 
the legs; put the latter into a mortar with half a pound each of finely-chopped 
lean veal and bacon, pound it to a pulp, season to taste with pepper, salt and 
spices and rub through a sieve; now add to the meat from the wings four to five 
ounces of parboiled bacon and three large uncooked truffles, all cut into dice. 
Lay the fowl flat on a board with the skin-side downward, season to taste, put in the 
forcemeat, roll up the galantine making it as long as possible, tie it up in a cloth 
and boil in stock for one and a half hours. Take it out, remove the cloth, tie it 
up in a clean one and let it get cold; then remove this cloth, cut the galantine into 
slices, brush them over with glaze and let them get cold and firm. Put a bread sup- 
port in the center of a dish, pile chopped fowl jelly onto it, lay the slices of 
galantine around, garnish the base of the support with croutons and chopped jelly 
alternately. 

Boned Ducks Stuffed and Served With Jelly. 

Take two ducks and pick out the pin feathers; singe them, but do not draw; 
rip the skins down the back and sever the flesh from the bones without cutting 
through. Chop through the wing and hip-joints with a knife, then cut with the 
boning-knife close to the breast-bone until the flesh of the duck comes off in one 
piece. Bone partly down the wings and legs, chop off the ends, wash and dry the 
meat, lay it on the table, skin downward, take scraps of meat from the thick parts 
and spread them over the thin, then sprinkle over a little pepper and salt and spread 
forcemeat over. Pull up the two sides together so as to form the shape of the duck 
before it was boned and sew them up strongly with thread; when both ducks are so 
prepared roll each separately in muslin, securing it tightly at the ends and in the 
middle, and boil from an hour and a half to two hours. When they are done put 
them (with the muslin still on) in oblong rounded bowls to keep them a good shape, 
put a dish on the top of each and a weight on the top of that and leave them to get 
cold. When ready to serve, take off the muslin, wipe them with a cloth dipped in 
hot water, trim off the edges and mask them over with melted butter. Cut the ducks 
in slices and arrange these on a dish with croutons of aspic jelly. 



COLD DISHES. 393 



Boned (Galantine of) Eel. 



Clean a large eel and remove the backbone; make a mince of the thin rind of a 
lemon, one tablespoonful each of parsley and sweet herbs, and a little ground mace, 
cayenne and salt; spread this over the inside of the eel and roll it up, commencing 
with the head. Tie the fish up in a cloth and boil in equal parts of water and vinegar 
until it is quite tender. Let the stock and the fish get quite cold, take out the fish, 
and serve. 

Boned Grouse (Galantine). 

Remove the bones from two small grouse, spread thickly with strips of rabbit or 
hare, lean cooked ham and fat bacon, placed alternately, having the strips the same 
length as the bird; season with salt and pepper, and cover with a thick layer of force- 
meat. Sew up the birds with threads, then roll them up in cloths. Place them in a 
stewpan with some vegetables, cover with stock and stew until tender. When cooked 
take the birds out of the cloths, put them in fresh ones, with their sewn parts at the 
top, and tie the cloths at either end. Put them in a deep dish, baste with half their 
cooking liquor, place another dish over them with a heavy weight on top, and press 
till cold. Prepare a thin puree of grouse and leave it until nearly cold. Remove the 
birds from the cloths and dip them into the grouse puree, giving them a thick coat- 
ing, then sprinkle thickly with breadcrumbs fried brown in butter, and some chopped 
pistachios; place them on a dish, garnish with croutons of aspic jelly, slices of lemon 
and parsley, arid serve. 

Boned (Galantine of) Partridges. 

Singe, draw and bone three partridges. Prepare some game forcemeat with the 
flesh from the legs and an equal quantity of ham. Peel four truffles, cut them in dice 
and mix. them with the forcemeat, seasoning well. Sprinkle pepper and salt inside 
the partridges, stuff them with the forcemeat, roll them round and sew them up. Tie 
each one in a cloth, put them in a saucepan of boiling stock, and boil them for one 
hour and a quarter. Take the galantines out and leave them until cold. Trim and 
cut the galantines into small slices without separating them, dip a paste brush in 
melted glaze and brush them over. Imbed three galantine moulds in pounded ice, 
and pour at the bottom of each a thin layer of clear aspic jelly; when the jelly has 
set put a galantine in each mould, pour gradually round some aspic jelly till the 
moulds are full, then leave them in the ice till the jelly has set. Mould some fancy 
subject in fat and fix it in the center of a bread support on a dish. When ready to 
serve, dip the moulds in tepid water, wipe them and turn the galantines out around 
the design. Fill some small fancy paper cases with cooked truffles that have been 
glazed, arrange them round the base of the support, and serve. 



394 COLD DISHES. 

Boned (or Galantine of) Pheasant. 

Select a large pheasant, pluck and draw it, split it down the back and bone it, 
spread the bird open on a cloth, and stuff it with a forcemeat composed of tongue, 
veal fat, truffles, white meat of poultry, and larding bacon, seasoned well with spices. 
Sew the bird up, bringing it back to its original shape as nearly as possible, wrap it 
in slices of fat bacon, fastening this on with small skewers, put it in a stewpan, pour 
over it in equal quantities sufficient white wine and broth to cover it, and stew it 
gently for three hours. Afterwards remove the pan from the fire, and leave the bird 
in the liquor for an hour; then take it out, clarify the liquor and strain it, and leave 
it until set. 

Boned (Galantines of) Plovers. 

Procure a cylinder mould having three rounded sides. Pluck and bone three 
plovers, and prepare a galantine forcemeat, mixing in with it a salpicon of raw truffles 
and fat liver; stuff the birds with the forcemeat, and roll each one separately in a 
piece of thin linen; place the birds in a stewpan with some well seasoned broth and 
stew them until they are quite tender. When done, drain the birds and put them 
between two dishes with a weight on top until quite cold. Then cut them into slices, 
put them in proper shape again, and glaze with a paste brush dipped in melted glaze; 
place the cylinder mould on the ice, pour in a thin layer of aspic jelly; stick a skewer 
through each of the galantines, lift them up and place them in the three rounded sides 
of the mould; then fill the space between the birds with jelly, pouring it in carefully 
so as not to disturb them, and let the mould remain on the ice until quite firm. Put 
a bread support on a dish and decorate with taste, fixing in the center another one 
the same height as the mould to fit the cylinder. Dip the mould in tepid water to 
detach the jelly, and then turn the contents on the first support, allowing the other to 
pass through the center of the galantines. Place a small article modeled in fat at the 
top of this one, and garnish in between each curved part of the galantines with some 
black truffles, peeled and glazed; decorate the base of the large support with some 
triangular-shaped croutons of aspic jelly, and serve. 

Boned (or Galantine of) Quails. 

Singe, draw and bone ten quails and stuff them with galantine forcemeat mixed 
with chopped truffles, roll them to an oval shape, and tie them up in some pieces of 
cloth. Cook the quails in mirepoix, and when done leave them until cool. Fix a 
block of fried bread two inches in diameter in the center of a dish, place a rice socle 
round the bread, and coat it with montpelier butter. Drain and unwrap the quails, 
glaze them with game glaze, place one on top of the bread and the others on the 
socle, leaning against the sides, garnish with chopped aspic and croutons of aspic, 
and serve. 



COLD DISHES. 395 

Boned (Galantines) of Snipes. 

Pluck and bone the snipes, prepare a game forcemeat, and mix some chopped 
truffles with it. Place the birds on the table, spread a thick layer of the mixture 
over them, then roll them to an oval shape, and wrap each bird separately in a sheet 
of buttered paper. Put the birds in a saucepan with a small quantity of stock and 
stew them gently; when cooked take them from the fire and leave until cold. When 
cold remove the paper from the birds, trim them and coat them with some brown 
chaudfroid sauce. When the sauce is cold on the birds decorate them with some 
calf's udder, then coat them again with half-set aspic jelly. Fix a support on a dish, 
and mask it with paper. In the center place a smaller one, on which fix a model of 
Minerva cast in fat. Place the cooked heads on the snipe at the base of the support 
on a string of chopped aspic jelly, stand the galantines on the large support, leaning 
them against the smaller one. Garnish the base of the first one with truffles in cases, 
and serve. 

Boned Turkey, American Style. 

Procure a fine tender young turkey weighing about eight pounds, singe and 
draw it, neatly wipe the interior, and bone it. Season the inside with one pinch 
of salt-and one-half pinch of pepper evenly distributed. Place the bird on a dish 
and then in the ice-box until wanted. Take two pounds of lean raw veal, three 
pounds of fresh pork, all cut up into small dice-shaped pieces; season with two pinches 
of salt, one pinch of white pepper, and one-third of a saltspoonful each of grated 
nutmeg and thyme, and mix all well together. Chop all exceedingly fine in the 
chopping-machine, repeating the process, if necessary, until it is chopped to perfec- 
tion. Should there be any sinews among the ingredients remove them. Place it on 
a dish, and stand the dish on the ice to cool until the following is prepared: Have 
ready one-fourth pound of the red end part of cooked smoked beef tongue, and 
eighteen medium-sized truffles, both cut in dice-shaped pieces one-half inch square. 
Take the forcemeat from the ice, and thoroughly mix the tongue and truffles with it, 
pouring in also one wineglassful of Madeira wine, and if liked, one-half breakfast 
cupful of peeled pistachios. Remove the turkey from the ice, spread it on a clean 
table (skin side downwards), and with a sharp knife cut away even slices from the 
breast; arrange them on the thin parts, so that the turkey will have an equal thick- 
ness all over. Place the forcemeat right in the center of the bird, column-shaped, 
leaving a clear space of two inches at each end, and four inches at each side. Spread 
on a table a strong napkin, sprinkling over it a small quantity of cold water. Fold 
up both ends of the turkey, then both sides, lift and lay it in the center of the napkin, 
roll it carefully in this, and tightly tie one end first, then the other. Place it in a 
large saucepan on a hot range, with the carcass, bones and trimmings, completely 
cover with cold water, and put the lid on; when coming to a boil thoroughly skim it, 



396 COLD DISHES. 

then add one good-sized scraped carrot, and one peeled onion with three or four 
cloves stuck in it, season with one pinch of salt, and boil on a moderate fire for fully 
two hours and a half. Remove the turkey with a skimmer, allow it to cool enough to be 
easily handled. Cut the strings at both ends, roll it over again as before, and tie 
both ends tightly as before. Place it in a flat tin pan, placing on the top of it a 
board the size of the turkey, and on the top of that a weight, leaving the weight on 
until the tuikey is thoroughly cold, which will take several hours; but avoid placing 
it on the ice until thoroughly cold. Two days after this it will be ready for use, 
keeping it on the ice in the same napkin in which it was cooked. 

Chaudfroid of Chicken. 

Divide in five pieces each, three roasted chickens (rather underdone), two 
wings, two legs and one breastpiece; remove the skin and some of the bones. Put 
three-quarters of a pint of yellow sauce in a saucepan, warm it and also warm half 
the quantity of aspic jelly; stand the pan on ice and stir with a wooden spoon until 
the sauce thickens; then take the pan off; dip the pieces of fowl one by one into the 
sauce and arrange them on a baking-sheet. Dip some slices of truffles in the sauce 
and with these decorate the sides of a plain border-mould; fill the mould gradually 
with sauce, surround it with ice and let it set. Wipe around the mould, turn the 
jelly out on a dish and fill the hollow of the border with a wooden support, having 
previously covered it with white paper. Trim the pieces of fowl, mask with a layer 
of jelly, dish on the support, and serve. 

Chaudfroid of Goose's Fat Liver Cutlets. 

A jar of Strasburg fat livers will be required for this dish. Remove the fat and 
keep it on ice for a few hours. When quite firm, divide the preparation into three 
equal portions, trim and cut them crosswise into slices, giving each the shape of 
cutlets as nearly as possible. Coat the cutlets with transparent chaudfroid sauce and 
leave them until cool. Fix a support of fat in the center of a bread-support and 
surround it with chopped aspic jelly. Trim the cutlets, fix some paper frills on the 
thin ends and arrange them in an upright circle on the bread-support, supported by 
the chopped jelly. Decorate the top of the support with an ornamental attelette, or 
fix bread-support on a dish having previously garnished it with a border of fat. 

Chaudfroid of Lark Galantines. 

Clean and bone the required quantity of larks. Prepare some lark forcemeat, 
mix in some truffles and stuff each lark with a small piece of the forcemeat. Butter 
the same quantity of dariole-moulds as there are larks, put one in each mould, 
breast downward, stand the moulds in a sautepan, pour a little water round them, 
place the pan in the oven and bake the larks until cooked. Reduce some 



COLD DISHES. 397 

Spanish sauce with essence of lark. Unmould the larks, wipe and dip them in the 
sauce, then leave on a dish until it is cold. Trim the same quantity of small minions 
of chicken as there are larks, contise them with truffles and put them in the oven. 
Prepare a socle of fried bread cut so as to form three tiers, place it on a hot dish, put 
the larks in some more of the sauce, arrange them in rows one above the other, 
place a contised fillet between each lark, and a border of croutons of meat jelly round 
the dish; garnish with chopped aspic jelly, and serve. 

Chaudfroid of Partridges with Truffles. 

Cut the breasts off five or six cold roasted partridges, divide each into three 
pieces, and trim the skin and pinion bones off. Prepare some chaudfroid sauce with 
two-thirds of brown sauce and one-third aspic jelly. Dip the pieces of partridge in 
the sauce, lay them on a dish and leave them till cool. Prepare a wooden stand with 
steps, mask it with fat, and fix it on a dish, placing o.n top a small subject cast in fat 
or stearine. Arrange the side fillets of the breast on the lower step, upright and 
overlapping, and surround them with a circle of chopped aspic ; put the middle pieces 
of the breast on the upper step. Garnish the base of the stand with some small 
folded paper cases each filled with a small glazed truffle, and serve. 



Chaudfroid of Pheasants. 

Pluck and truss two pheasants, wrap them in buttered paper, and roast them 
without coloring. When cold cut them up in several pieces, strip off the skin, dip them 
in chaudfroid sauce, and leave on a dish to set. Arrange some small evenly-cut 
pieces of the fillets in a border mould ; fill it with half-set savory aspic jelly, and 
when the jelly is quite set turn out the border on a dish. Fix a crouton of fried 
bread in the center, and pile the pieces of pheasant over it. A few sprigs of parsley 
may be tucked in here and there to complete the effect. 



Chaudfroid of Pigeons. 



Prepare and truss the pigeons as for roasting, and season them with salt and 
pepper. Put them in a baking-dish, pour round some veal stock, and bake them, 
basting occasionally with the liquor in the pan. When done, drain, and cut them 
into convenient-sized pieces. When the stock is cold, skim off all the fat, pour 
it into a small saucepan, add the white of an egg, and boil it till reduced to a 
jelly. Then strain it through a napkin and let it get cold. Place the pigeons on a 
dish, cut the jelly into croutons and place round them, garnish with a few sprigs of 
green watercress, and serve. 



39 8 COLD DISHES. 

Chaudfroid of Plovers. 

Quarter four plovers which have been previously either baked or roasted and are 
cold; remove the skin and bones; place the entrails in a mortar, pound and rub them 
through a fine sieve. Prepare a small quantity of thick gravy or extract of game 
with the bones and trimmings of the plovers, straining through a sieve and taking off 
all fat and reduce it to half glaze; then add half a pint of brown sauce to thicken it 
and boil for a few minutes, when it will be ready for use. Pour the gravy slowly 
into the pounded entrails and add a third of its quantity of liquid aspic jelly; when 
the sauce becomes cold stir over the ice until thick; dip the quarters of plovers in it, 
coating them well, and arrange them on a baking sheet to let the sauce set; then 
remove all superfluous sauce from the quarters, pile them on a dish with the legs 
turned toward the bottom and wings to the top in the center of a border of the aspic 
jelly, and serve. 

Chaudfroid of Quails. 

Draw and clean the birds well, remove the breasts and backbones, but leave the 
legs. Cut four ounces of fat bacon into small pieces, fry it for a few minutes and 
then add one-half pound of calf's liver also cut up, one chopped carrot and onion, a 
bunch of sweet herbs and a seasoning of salt and pepper and grated nutmeg. When 
well cooked pound the above mixture in a mortar until it is quite smooth, then pass 
it through a fine hair-sieve. Stuff the birds with the liver forcemeat. Tie each one 
separately in a piece of muslin and place them in a stewpan. Chop the bones of the 
birds and put them in with them, add some chopped vegetables, a bay leaf and a 
sprig of thyme, one-half pint of stock and one teacupful of sherry. When boiling 
move the stewpan to the side of the fire and allow the contents to simmer gently for 
thirty minutes or so. When cooked remove the birds from the stewpan, drain and 
press them lightly between two dishes. Strain the cooking liquor of the birds through 
a silk sieve, return it to the stewpan and boil until reduced to a glaze. Remove the 
pieces of muslin from the quails, baste them with the glaze several times in order to 
coat them well, and leave them until cold. When ready arrange the birds in a circle 
on a dish, garnish them with chopped aspic jelly, fill the center with small salad, and 
serve. 

Chaudfroid of Salmon. 

Cut a piece about four inches thick from the middle of a salmon and pass a 
sharp knife between the skin and the fish until almost, but not quite separated; roll a 
small carrot up in a slice of bacon and put it in the hollow of the fish to preserve its 
shape, then bind rashers of bacon round the whole of the fish, tying them with fine 
twine. Chop fine three rashers of fat bacon and four ounces of beef suet, place 
them in a stewpan with a few sprigs of parsley, a few slices of onions and carrots, the 
juice of a small lemon, one teaspoonful of cloves and peppercorns and a moderate

quantity of salt. Toss these ingredients over the fire for a few minutes without 
browning them, then pour in as much water as will cover the fish and boil it gently 
for an hour. Afterwards strain the liquor and let it cool. Place the salmon in a 
stewpan that is not too large, but will hold it comfortably, pour the sauce over it and 
allow it to simmer at the edge of the fire. When cooked, leave the fish in the sauce 
until nearly cold, then drain it and leave it until quite cold and firm. Wash and bone 
two anchovies and chop them with a few chives and green gherkins, one small table- 
spoonful of capers and a small bunch of tarragon-leaves and parsley. Put all these 
ingredients into a mortar with the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs and pound them 
well. Add to the mixture two ounces of butter, one-half teacupful of salad oil 
which should be poured in slowly, one scant tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar and 
salt and pepper to taste. Pass the mixture through a fine hair-sieve with a wooden 
spoon, and keep it on the ice until firm. Cut a thick oval-shaped slice of bread, 
trimming off all the crust and fry it in butter until of a light golden brown. Spread 
some of the above mixture over the bread, put it on a dish, lay the fish on it and 
cover the top of it with a thin layer of the same mixture, leveling it over with the 
blade of a knife, occasionally dipped in warm water. Cut into various shapes some 
hard-boiled white of egg and truffles and ornament the top of the fish with them; 
strew over it here and there a little lobster spawn. Garnish the dish with croutons of 
aspic jelly, and serve. 

Chaudfroid of Snipes. 

Singe and draw ten snipes, season their interiors, then put them aside with their 
heads. Cut into thin slices one-half pound of calf's liver and put these in a fryingpan 
with a little lard, toss them over the fire for a few minutes, then put in with them the 
tails of the snipes, a pinch of chopped onions, a few sprigs of sweet herbs and some 
trimmings of truffles, sprinkling over plenty of salt and pepper. When cooked leave 
the liver and trails till cool, then place them in a mortar with half their quantity of 
chopped fresh bacon and pound them. Add to the forcemeat two or three truffles 
cut into small pieces. Stuff the snipes with the liver mixture, roll them into oval 
shapes, sew them up, and fasten a strip of buttered paper around each. Line the 
bottom of a stewpan with some trimmings of bacon, put in the snipes, moisten them 
to half their height with some white wine and gravy made from the bones and trim- 
mings of the snipes. Place a sheet of paper on the top, put on the lid, set it in the 
oven and braise the snipes for twenty minutes. When cooked, take out the snipes 
and let them cool, then remove the paper and strings and trim them neatly. Skim 
the fat off the cooking liquor, strain it through a fine hair-sieve into another stewpan, 
mix with it one-half pint of brown sauce and boil for fifteen or twenty minutes, skim- 
ming occasionally; then stir in with it half its quantity of aspic jelly. When the 
sauce is thick and smooth strain it through a sieve into another stewpan and leave it 
until nearly cool, then stand the stewpan on ice and stir it for a few minutes. 
Plunge the snipes in the sauce and cover them well with it; then arrange them on a

baking sheet and leave until the sauce has set. In the meantime cook the heads of 
the birds, trim them, and glaze them with a paste brush dipped in melted glaze. 
Remove the snipes from the baking-dish, using a fork for the purpose, cut off all the 
superfluous sauce, and arrange them in the form of a dome on a small stand. Put 
one of the heads between each of the birds, separating them with chopped aspic jelly. 
The chaudfroid is then ready for serving. 



Chaudfroid of Turkey. 



Cut the flesh off the breast of a large turkey that has been cooked and cooled, 
and then cut it into thin fillets lengthwise; trim them to an equal size, dip them in 
some chaudfroid sauce and lay them side by side on a bakingsheet. Leave the fillets 
till the sauce is cold, then trim and coat them with some aspic jelly. Have in readi- 
ness a small pyramid, shaped out of fat, stuck on a bread support and ornamented on 
the top with a vase of fat. Arrange the fillets on the bread, leaning against the pyra- 
mid and garnish the base of them with a circle of chopped jelly. Hollow out some 
cooked truffles, fill them with a salpicon of turkey that has been thickened with may- 
onnaise sauce, and arrange them round the bottom of the support, and serve. If liked 
the fillets of turkey may be alternated with fillets of pickled tongue that has been 
coated with red aspic. 

Chaudfroid of Woodcocks. 

Pluck and singe some woodcocks, wrap them in sheets of buttered paper, lay them 
in a bakingpan and roast them in the oven; do not brown them, but keep them 
rather underdone. When cold cut the birds into joints, coat them over with chaud- 
froid sauce that has been reduced with essence of woodcock, and lay them on a dish 
till the sauce has cooled. Garnish a round border mould with some cooked minion 
fillets of woodcocks, fill it with aspic jelly and leave it till set. Turn the border of 
jelly out onto a round dish, put a block of fried bread in the center, arrange the pieces 
of birds inside the circle, leaning them against the bread support, and serve. 



Partridge Cutlets. 



Bone and skin some partridges, shape them like cutlets, cut them across in thin 
slices, mask them with a few cooked poultry livers that have been pounded into a 
paste, and then cover this with brown chaudfroid sauce; arrange them side by side on 
a bakingsheet and bake. When done glaze them with aspic jelly, and as soon as the 
jelly has set trim off the superfluous sauce and fasten paper ruffles round the bones. 
Put in the center of the dish some small-glazed truffles, arrange the cutlets round 
them, finish with a chain of small aspic jelly croutons round the cutlets, and serve. 



COLD DISHES. 401 

Calf's Head Cheese. 

This tasty preparation can be produced with any remains of cold, cooked calf's 
head, as follows: Cut the meat into moderate-sized pieces, place them in a saucepan 
with some brains or brain sauce, pour in a wineglassful of Madeira or sherry, one or 
two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and sufficient calf's head stock to cover; sprinkle in 
some salt, pepper, and powdered sage, and add a lump or two of sugar. When boil- 
ing move the stewpan to the side of the fire, and allow the contents to simmer gently, 
keeping them thoroughly stirred. When the liquor has reduced to a jelly, place the 
cheese in a mould, and leave it until cold and stiff. When ready to serve turn it out 
onto a folded napkin or an ornamental dish paper, on a dish. 

Pig's Head Cheese. 

Thoroughly clean a pig's head, split it into halves, take out the eyes and brains, 
cut off the nose and ears, and pour scalding water over the latter and the head, 
and scrape them clean. Then rinse all in cold water, and put them into a saucepan 
with sufficient water to cover, and boil slowly, taking off the scum as it rises. When 
boiled so that the bones leave the meat readily, take them from the water and put 
them in a large wooden bowl or tray. Remove every particle of bone, chop the meat 
small, season to taste with salt and pepper, and if relished, a little chopped sage or 
thyme. Spread a cloth in a sieve, set in it a deep dish, put in the meat, then fold the 
cloth closely over it, lay over a plate with a weight on it, which will press equally the 
whole surface. Let the weight be more or less heavy according as you wish the 
cheese to be fat or lean; a heavy weight by pressing out the fat will of course leave 
the cheese lean. When cold, scrape off whatever fat may be found on the outside of 
the cloth, and keep the cheese in the cloth in a cool place. It should be sliced thin, 
and can be eaten with or without mustard and vinegar or catsup. 

Jellied Veal or Veal Head Cheese. 

Take about two pounds of knuckle of veal, wash it and cut it into two or three 
pieces. Allow it to simmer in just enough water to cover the meat, until the latter can 
easily be removed from the bones which will take from three to four hours. Take 
it up, remove all the bone, and chop the meat up fine; add to it salt, pepper, mace 
and finely-chopped shallots and thyme, according to the taste. Put all these into 
the liquor and boil it until it is almost reduced, then stir in the strained juice of a 
lemon. Turn it into a mould, and let it stand until the following day. Turn it out 
onto a dish, and serve garnished with parsley. 

Chicken in Jelly. 

Draw and clean a chicken and cut it up with the exception of the breast, which

402 COLD DISHES. 

add two bay leaves, a small bunch of parsley and thyme and half of a small lemon; 
pour in water to cover, season to taste with salt and pepper, and boil the chicken very 
gently until tender. When cooked take it out of the liquor, cut the meat off the 
breast in four long strips and cut the remainder of the meat into small pieces. Put 
the bones back in the saucepan with half an ounce of gelatine that has been dissolved 
in a small quantity of water and boil gently for fifteen or twenty minutes longer. 
Strain the liquor through a jelly bag and pour sufficient into a deep pie dish to cover 
the bottom. When the jelly has set, arrange on the top of it a device in hard boiled 
eggs, put the largest slice of chicken in the center of the dish, arrange some of the 
other slices around it, pour in another layer of the jelly, and leave it until set. Then 
put . in the remainder of the pieces of meat, arrange them tastefully, pour the re- 
mainder of the jelly carefully over, and put it in a cold place. When the jelly is firm 
dip the dish in warm water, wipe it and turn the contents over on a dish upon which 
is a folded napkin, garnish with a few sprigs of parsley, and serve. 

Jelly of Pig's Feet and Ears. 

Wash and clean carefully the feet and ears of a pig and put them in a basin of 
water to soak for several hours. Then put them in a saucepan with a little water and 
boil over a slow fire for four or five hours, until the feet and ears are quite done and 
the bones of the former can be easily extracted; then add a teacupful of chopped 
sage and parsley in equal proportions, one-half saltspoonful of powdered mace, a 
teaspoonful of salt and half as much pepper. Set the pan again over a slow fire and 
cook slowly until the herbs are tender; then pour the whole into a melon mould, and, 
when set, turn it out, and serve. 



Pig's Head in Jelly. 



Clean a small pig's head and feet, put them in a saucepan with two calf's feet, 
one onion and a bunch of sweet herbs; season with salt and pepper, squeeze in the 
juice of a lemon and moisten to height with water; set the pan over the fire until it 
boils, then remove to the side and cook slowly for two or three hours, or until the 
meat is tender. When cooked take the head and feet out of the liquor and remove 
all the bones, cut the meat in small pieces and mix with it a small quantity of roast 
meat or any remains of cold cooked tongue or poultry. When the cooking liquor 
has partly cooled, skim off all the fat, strain it through a fine hair-sieve, return it to 
the pan and boil until it is reduced to the consistency of thick jelly. Put the meat 
in the liquor with a few pickled gherkins and one tablespoonful of vinegar, and season 
with salt, pepper and a little grated nutmeg or mace. Stir the mixture over the fire 
till thoroughly hot. Coat the inside of a mould with a small quantity of gelatine, 
arrange at the bottom a design cut out of pickled beet-root and around the edges 
finely-minced parsley and the separated yolks and whites of hard-boiled eggs. Over

in a fish-kettle with some water a bay leaf, a peeled and sliced onion, a moderate 
quantity of spices, salt, pepper and a little vinegar. Boil the water for some min- 
utes, then remove it from the fire. When the liquor is cool, put in the fish, and place 
it over the fire until on the point of boiling ; then move it to the side and let it sim- 
mer until the fish is done. When cooked, drain the fish carefully, and baste them 
occasionally with clear fish jelly until they are well coated. When the fish and jelly 
are quite cold, trim them neatly, lay them on a dish over which has been spread a 
folded napkin or an ornamental dish-paper, garnish them with small croutons of jelly 
and bunches of neatly-selected fresh parsley, and serve.

some freshly-boiled shrimps, chop and mix them with the fish. Put all into a mortar 
and pound until smooth. Work in with the paste an equal quantity of fresh butter 
and season to taste with grated nutmeg, mace, salt and a small quantity of cayenne. 
Pass the mixture through a fine hair-sieve, pack it into small moulds, leave about a 
quarter of an inch at the top of each, and fill up with clarified butter. Keep the 
moulds in a cool larder. Turn the fish out of the moulds on a dish with a folded 
napkin, garnish with parsley, and serve. 

Potted Game. 

Remove the skin from some remains of cold, cooked game, chop the meat, put 
it in a mortar and pound until quite smooth. Mix with it about a third of its bulk of 
fresh butter and season to taste with pounded mace, pepper, salt and a small quantity 
of cayenne. When quite smooth, turn the mixture into small jars, cover and tie down. 

Potted Goose. 

Singe and draw a goose, and remove the bones. To fill a potting pan seven 
inches in diameter the goose should weigh about four pounds when cleaned and with- 
out the giblets. Lard the breast with strips of fat bacon and sprinkle over with a 
little salt and pepper. Remove the sinews from the thighs, cut off the flesh, add to 
it eight ounces of fillet of veal and one pound of fat bacon, chop them all up and 
pound in a mortar together with one ounce of spiced salt. Put a layer of this mixture 
at the bottom of the pan. Spread out the goose with the skin part downwards, dust 
it over with a little more spiced salt, put another layer of the veal mixture in the in- 
side of it, roll it around and put it in the pan ; cover over with more of the veal 
mixture, put a few slices of bacon on the top, place a bay leaf on this, put the lid on 
the pan and set it in a large saucepan, pour in water to about two inches in depth, 
place the saucepan in the oven and cook for three hours. When the goose is done, 
which can be ascertained by putting a trussing needle into it, take it out, let it get 
cold and cover over in the dish with a layer of the melted fat of the goose. Let it 
remain for a day, and it will then be ready for use. 

Potted Goose's Fat Livers. 

Chop fine one and a half pounds of goose's fat livers and half a pound of calf's 
liver, put them in a mortar, pound until quite smooth, and pass them through a fine 



COLD DISHES. 409 

hair-sieve. Put a quarter of a pound of butter in a stewpan with the pounded livers, 
and stir over the fire for a few minutes ; next mix in two tablespoonfuls of thick 
cream, a few drops of rosewater, salt to taste, a small quantity of cayenne and 
stir the mixture over the fire for five minutes longer ; then put in a few chopped 
truffles and one teaspoonful of brandy. Let the mixture stew gently at the side of 
the fire until very thick, then pack it in small jars, leaving about a third of an inch 
clear space at the top. When cold, fill the jars up with clarified butter, tie them over 
with parchment, and keep in a dry place. 



Potted Ham. 

Trim all the meat from the remains of a boiled ham, chop it very fine, being 
careful to remove all outside pieces and gristle, pound it to a paste, measure it, and 
to each pint, mix in one teaspoonful of mixed mustard and a small pinch of cayenne, 
and should the ham be very lean, one tablespoonful of butter. Pack this smoothly 
in small earthen jars, paste paper over and put on the covers. Stand the jars in a 
deep baking-dish, surround them nearly to the top with hot water and let them steam 
slowly for two hours. When done, remove the jars from the pan and let them cool 
with the covers on. When cold, remove the covers, pour into each jar a little melted 
butter, place fresh covers on and keep them in a cool, dry cupboard until wanted for 
use. Ham prepared in this way makes delicious sandwiches and will keep for months. 



Potted Hare. 

Skin, draw, wash and bone a hare, keeping the blood to mix in with the force- 
meat. Cut off the meat from the shoulders, and half that of the legs, remove all 
skin and sinews and put this flesh into a mortar with twelve pounds of veal without 
skin or gristle, add one pound of fat bacon, both cut up small ; pound it, and while 
doing so, add one ounce of spiced salt and the blood. Lard the body with pieces of 
fat bacon, cut it in halves, dust it over well with about two ounces of spiced salt, put 
it in a stewpan with one ounce of butter, and fry it for ten minutes. Put a layer of 
the forcemeat at the bottom of a pottingpan to about one inch in thickness, then put 
in half of the body, sprinkle it over with another ounce of spiced salt, then more 
forcemeat and so on, ending with a layer of forcemeat. Put a slice of bacon on top, 
a bayleaf on that, cover the pan, put it in a saucepan two inches deep with water, 
place the saucepan over the fire and cook for three hours or until done, which may be 
ascertained by piercing the flesh with a very clean trussing-needle. When done, let 
it get cold, cover with melted fat, and it is ready for use. It should not be used 
within a day or so of making, and if kept for a time, pork should be used instead of 
the veal, and in the same proportion. 



4 io COLD DISHES. 

Potted Larks. 

Carefully pick, singe and draw the required number of larks, dry them, sprinkle 
plentifully inside and out with pepper, salt and pounded mace, place them in stone 
jars with a piece of butter, tie down and bake in a moderate oven. When cooked, 
take the larks out of the gravy, put them into potting jars, pour clarified butter over, 
cover them with stout paper, tie them down tightly and keep them in a dry closet 
until required for use. 

Potted Liver. 

Put the required amount of any kind of liver with a little highly seasoned stock 
into a stewpan and braise it. When done and quite tender, cut it up very fine and 
put it into a mortar and pound to a paste, adding enough of the stock to moisten. 
Melt, strain and add to the paste one-fourth pound of butter, season with salt, pepper, 
ground allspice and mace, and pass the whole through a fine hair-sieve ; then place it 
in jars, cover with melted butter, and stand the jars in a cool place until wanted. 
Poultry livers may be treated in the same manner ; if truffles or mushrooms are 
added they are very good imitations of foies gras. 

Potted Lobster. 

Procure a large cooked lobster or two small ones, pick out all the meat and place 
it with the spawn in the mortar, pound it to a paste, then mix with it one-fourth 
pound of fresh butter, a little pounded mace and cloves, pepper, salt and grated nut- 
meg. When thoroughly mixed fill some jars with the preparation, press it down 
tightly, leaving about one-fourth inch space at the top, and fill it up with clarified 
butter. When quite cold tie the jars over with white paper, and keep them in a dry 
closet until required for use. 

Potted Mackerel. 

Clean the mackerel well, dry it, season to taste with pepper and salt, place it in 
a baking-dish with mixed spice, a couple of bay leaves and a little butter ; bake it in 
the oven, and when sufficiently done take it out and allow it to cool, Then bone and 
lay the meat in pots, and pour over enough melted butter to cover. 

Potted Mushrooms. 

Large button mushrooms without any brown color inside them should be used, 
and about two quarts will be enough. Peel and remove the fur from the larger ones, 
put them all into a saucepan with one-half dram of powdered mace, two drams of 
white pepper and eight powdered cloves; place the pan over the fire and shake and 
toss it until the liquor from the mushrooms has all dried up. Then add two ounces 



COLD DISHES. 411 

of butter and cook until the mushrooms are well done; drain off the butter and leave 
until quite cold. Pack the mushrooms closely in an earthenware pot, pour over some 
warmed butter, cover with white paper, over this pour clarified beef suet to exclude 
the air, and set away in a cool place until wanted. 

Potted Mutton. 

Chop up some cold cooked mutton, remove all the skin and sinew, and pound it 
in a mortar with half its bulk of cooked bacon. Season with allspice, salt and pepper 
to taste, place it in a jar in a saucepan of water and boil till the mass is warmed quite 
through. Take out the jar, stir frequently until the meat is nearly cold, squeeze it 
into small pots, let it remain for a day, then cover with clarified butter or hot mutton 
suet so as to exclude the air. 

Potted Partridges. 

Mix together the following spices: one teaspoonful of ground cloves, one-half 
teaspoonful each of ground mace, allspice and white pepper, one-half tablespoonful 
of salt, and a small quantity each of nutmeg and cayenne pepper. Prepare the part- 
ridges as for roasting, season them both inside and out with the spices, and truss 
them. Put a thick layer of vine leaves at the bottom of a stewpan, put the birds in 
breasts downwards, and cover them with clarified butter; cover and cook over a slow 
fire. When cooked take them out and drain well. Clarify their cooking butter and 
let it get cold, then take the solid butter that is free from the gravy and melt it again. 
Put the birds in jars, pour the warmed butter over them, and when it has cooled again 
tie parchment over the jars. Should it be required to keep them longer than a week 
pour melted paraffin wax over them. 

Potted Pheasant. 

Pluck and draw the pheasant, wipe it clean with a damp cloth, singe it, and season 
the inside with pepper, salt, cloves, beaten mace and grated nutmeg. Break the 
breastbones and flatten them down. Put the bird in an earthen bowl with a large 
lump of butter, and bake it for one hour. When cooled, drain the pheasant, and 
leave it till cold ; then put it in a large jar, the breast downwards, and pour in clarified 
butter to one-half inch in thickness. Tie paper over the jar, and keep it in a cool 
place. 

Potted Pigeons. 

Boil the livers and gizzards of some pigeons until tender, drain and chop them 
fine, make them into a forcemeat with grated ham, breadcrumbs, the yolk of a hard- 
boiled egg, and a seasoning of herbs. Stuff the pigeons with the forcemeat, put 
them into a stewpan with an onion, one-half pint of white wine, and the liquor in 
which the gizzards were stewed, add one ounce of butter that has been kneaded with 



412 COLD DISHES. 

a tablespoonful of flour, and cook slowly till tender. When cooked pack the pigeons 
in suitable pots ; strain their cooking liquor, return it to the saucepan and boil quickly 
for a few minutes ; then pour a little of it over the birds to level up, and when cold, 
cover the contents with warmed clarified butter. 



Potted Pig's Head. 



Clean a pig's head thoroughly, washing it in strong salt and water ; put it n a 
saucepan with plenty of water, and boil slowly. When very tender, so that the 
bones can be easily removed, drain the head, separate all the meat from the bones, 
and pass the cooking liquor through a fine hair-sieve, When the liquor is quite cold, 
skim off the fat and pour the liquor into a saucepan, being careful not to disturb the 
sediment. Cut the meat in medium-sized pieces, put it in with the liquor, and boil 
for half an hour, seasoning to taste with salt, pepper and a little Jamaica pepper. 
Pour the meat and liquor into moulds, leave until cold. Then tie stout paper over 
the tops. It may be kept for six weeks in a cool cupboard. 

Potted Pork. 

Cut into nice-sized pieces a couple of pounds of lean pork and line an earthen- 
ware jar with chopped beef-suet, put the pieces of meat in, with a piece of mace and 
dust over with salt and pepper; pour in one and a half breakfast cupfuls of water and 
cover over with chopped suet. Tie a stout piece of paper very tightly over the jar 
and put it in a moderate oven for three hours, then remove the jar and leave it until 
the following day. Take the. pieces of pork out of the jar, place them in a mortar 
and pound them to a smooth paste, adding salt and pepper if necessary, together with 
any other seasoning that may be liked; press the meat into small jars, leaving about 
half an inch space at the top of each, which fill up with clarified suet; tie the jars over 
and place them in dry cupboards until required for use. 

Potted Rabbit. 

Draw, skin and clean two or three young rabbits, chop off the hind legs at the 
thigh, and put them together with all the flesh into a saucepan, packing them in 
as tightly as possible and sprinkling them with powdered mace and allspice, pepper, 
salt and cayenne to taste. Place several large lumps of butter on the top, which should 
be as flat as possible, cover with the lid, put the saucepan in a slow oven and bake 
gently for two hours and a half. Allow the meat to remain in the pan for two or 
three days, then put it into pots, cover the tops with hot butter, let this cool and 
the meat is then ready for use. The livers may also be added if desired and are 
an improvement. 



COLD DISHES. 413 

Potted Reed Birds. 

Take the butter off the top of the potted birds, throw them, one at a time, into a 
saucepan of boiling water and leave them for half a minute, then remove and dry 
them thoroughly both inside and out. When all the birds have thus been treated 
leave them until quite cold; then season them with salt, pepper and powdered mace, 
pack them closely in jars and pour clarified butter on the top. When potted birds 
are sent a long way the odor is often so bad as to be unendurable from the rankness 
of the butter. If prepared as described above they will be as though freshly potted. 

Potted Salmon. 

Select a piece of salmon, but do not wash it; wipe it very dry and scale it. 
Place it on a dish, sprinkle salt over, and rub it in well. Let the fish remain in the 
salt until the latter has all melted and drained away, the dish being placed in a slightly 
sloping position so that it may drain off as it dissolves. When ready place the fish in 
a deep bakingpan, together with a seasoning of bruised mace, cloves, whole peppers, 
and three or four bay leaves; put plenty of butter over it, cover the pan closely, and 
bake the salmon. When well done, drain the fish from the liquor, press it into pots, 
and allow it to become quite cold; then pour into each pot a sufficient quantity 
of clarified butter to cover. 

Potted Shrimps. 

Pick some shrimps from their shells, season them to taste with salt and cayenne, 
and pack them tightly in pots. Have some butter in a saucepan over the fire, and 
when it boils, pour it over the shrimps until they are quite covered and the pots 
nearly filled; allow them to get quite cold, then pour over the top boiling butter and 
lard mixed so that the air cannot reach the butter first poured in. The shrimps may 
be pounded and softened with butter, then pressed into a shallow jar, and covered 
with oiled butter. 

Potted Tongue. 

Rub a beef tongue well with one-fourth pound of brown sugar, and one ounce of 
saltpeter. Leave it for two days; then boil it until it is tender. Drain and skin the 
tongue, cut it into small pieces, and pound them to a smooth paste in a mortar with 
one pound of clarified butter. Season to taste with pepper and salt, and add a small 
quantity of pounded mace. Press the paste into small jars, cover with parchment, 
and tie them down. 

Potted Trout. 

Clean one dozen or so of small trout, wash well, dry on a cloth, sprinkle them 
over with one ounce of white pepper, half that quantity of powdered cloves, one- 
fourth ounce of cayenne and a small quantity of mace. Put the trout, backs down- 



4 i4 COLD DISHES. 

ward, into an earthenware jar or pot, pour over two pounds or so of clarified butter, 
place the jar in a slack oven and bake for about four hours. When done take it out 
and the fish are ready for use. 

Potted Turkey. 

Draw and singe a turkey and bone it. Cut the flesh off the thighs, trim off all 
the sinews and chop it fine. Chop one pound of fat bacon and one-half pound of 
lean veal, mix them with the chopped turkey flesh, season with salt and spices and 
pound the whole in a mortar. Lard the breasts of the turkey with the seasoned 
strips of fat bacon. Place a layer of the pounded mixture of forcemeat at the bottom 
of a potting jar. Spread out the turkey, skin downward, dust it over with spices and 
salt, cover the inside with a layer of forcemeat, roll the bird up, place it in the jar, 
spread the remaining forcemeat over it, put some thin rashers of fat bacon and a bay 
leaf on top and place the cover on the jar. Stand the jar in a large stewpan, pour in 
water to about one-third its height, place the stewpan in the oven and cook the turkey 
for about three hours. When cooked remove the jar from the oven, leave it until 
cold, then cover the contents with a layer of poultry dripping. The turkey should 
not be served until two days or more after it has been potted. 

Potted Turkey Livers. 

Prepare three or four turkey livers, place them in a stewpan together with some 
very fat bacon and fry them until they commence to brown; then put in with them 
one clove of garlic, one bay leaf, four or five cloves and one-half saltspoonful of 
pepper. Pour in one-half pint of red wine and leave the saucepan over the fire until 
the liquor boils; then remove it to the side and keep the contents simmering for 
thirty minutes or more; take the livers out of the stewpan, put them in a mortar with 
half their quantity of fresh butter and pound to a smooth paste, adding more season- 
ing if required. Press the pounded liver into small jars, leaving a space about one- 
third of an inch at the top, which fill up with turkey fat or clarified butter. Cover 
the jars with paper and tie them down securely with twine. Keep them in a dry 
store cupboard for further use. 

Potted Veal. 

Take a cutlet of fillet of veal weighing nearly a pound, season to taste with pep- 
percorns, mace and cloves, place it in a saucepan that will only just hold it, fill up 
the pan with water and bake for three hours. Place it in a mortar and pound it fine, 
with salt to taste and about two ounces of butter slightly warmed. If it be for im- 
mediate use, a little of the gravy it was baked in may be used to moisten it in the mor- 
tar; if it is to be kept for any length of time, do not use anything but butter. When 
beaten to a fine smooth paste, put it into pots and pour over sufficient butter melted 
to oil to cover it to a depth of about one-fifth of an inch. 



COLD DISHES. 415 

Potted Venison. 

Cut some cold cooked venison into thin slices. Put one-half pound of butter 
into a stewpan with a small quantity of spices, such as cloves, grated nutmeg and 
white pepper, and place it over the fire. When melted, put in the meat, and for every 
pound add one tablespoonful of currant jelly and one wineglassful of red wine. 
Allow the meat to simmer in the butter for twenty minutes, then remove it, mince it 
fine and pound it in a mortar. When quite smooth, pass the meat through a fine 
sieve and mix the cooking-butter arid gravy with it. Pack it in small jars and press 
it down tightly, leaving a clear one-fourth inch space at the top. Fill the jars with 
clarified butter, and when it is cold, tie the jars over tightly and put them away for 
use. 

Pressed Chicken. 

Put a chicken into a saucepan with a very little water and boil until the bones 
slip out and the gristly parts are quite soft. Take off the skin and pull the meat to 
pieces, mixing the dark-colored and white meat together. Skim the fat off the 
liquor and season with a little pepper, salt, lemon-juice and celery salt, and reduce to 
half a pint, then mix it in with the meat. Butter a mould and decorate the bottom and 
sides with hard-boiled eggs cut in slices and small fancy-shaped pieces of tongue or 
ham; pack the meat in tightly, put a weight on the top and let it remain in a cold 
place until wanted. Turn them out and garnish with parsley, lettuce leaves, celery 
branches, radishes or beet-roots cut into various shapes. 



Salmon Montpelier. 



Cut about eight pounds from the middle of a large salmon, put it into a braising- 
pan with a few sliced carrots and onions, one-fourth pound of butter, a bunch of 
thyme, basil, and half a dozen bay leaves, three quarts of stock, two quarts of water, 
and one-half bottle of chablis. Place the pan over the fire until the liquor begins to 
boil, then move it to the side and simmer it gently for an hour. Blanch in equal 
quantities some chives and parsley, place them in a mortar with one or two boned 
anchovies, and pound them well together with four ounces of butter and a small 
quantity of cayenne pepper. When quite smooth place the mixture on a plate, and 
set it on the ice. When the salmon is cooked, leave it in the liquor until cold, then 
drain it and spread the above mixture over on both sides. Place it on an oval dish, 
decorate it with lobster spawn, garnish the dish with truffles, parsley, chopped whites 
of eggs, and croutons of aspic jelly; fill up the cavity in the body of the salmon with 
parsley, and serve. 

Terrine of Chicken Livers. 

Peel four or five large truffles, cut them into dice and put them in a basin with 
six ounces of cooked fat bacon also cut into dice and the livers of ten or twelve fat 



4 i6 COLD DISHES. 

chickens; sprinkle salt, spices and powdered sweet herbs over, and one tablespoonful 
of Madeira wine. Cut half a calf's liver in thin slices, fry it in a little melted bacon 
fat with a tablespoonful of chopped shallots and the trimmings of the truffles and 
sprinkle pepper and salt over them. When the slices of liver are well set, pour in 
one teacupful of Madeira; keep it on the fire for two or three minutes, then take it 
off. When cold pound the liver. Chop and pound an equal quantity of fat bacon, 
mix it with the pounded liver, season well with pepper, salt and mixed spices, and 
pass all through a sieve. Line a terrine at the bottom and all round the sides with 
thin slices of fat pork, spread over some of the liver forcemeat, fill the dish with the 
livers, truffles and pork and alternate layers of the forcemeat; put some thin slices of 
fat bacon on the top, put on the lid, stand it in a baking-dish and bake it in a moder- 
ate oven for two hours, basting occasionally with the fat that runs over into the 
baking-dish underneath. When cooked, take the terrine out, lift off the lid, put a 
wooden weight on the top, and let it cool. When ready to serve turn the preparation 
out of the terrine, and cut it up. Clean the terrine, put it on a dish, fill it with the 
cut up pieces, arranging them to come dome-shaped on top, and place around some 
croutons of aspic jelly. 

Terrine of Partridge. 

Empty two partridges, bone them, cut them in two lengthwise, put them in a 
fryingpan with a little bacon fat, and fry them lightly till the flesh is set, then 
take them out. Cut the half of a calf's liver in slices, fry it quickly in a little 
bacon fat, with a little chopped onion, a sprinkling of fine herbs, and two or three 
pieces of raw ham. When cold put the liver in a mortar, pound it, then pass it 
through a fine hair-sieve. Put half as much pork and bacon as there is liver in 
the mortar to pound, then mix it with the liver, and season well with mixed 
spices, salt and pepper. Line a terrine with thin slices of fat bacon, then fill it 
with the halves of the partridges and the forcemeat, add some sweet herbs and 
a little Madeira; put a layer of forcemeat on the top. Cover with a flat of paste, 
put it in the oven, and bake it for two hours, basting it occasionally. When 
cooked, take the flat of paste off, put a light weight on the terrine, and let it 
cool; then take the fat off, and cut the preparation up. Wipe and fix the terrine 
on a dish, garnish round the base with a folded napkin or an ornamental dish- 
paper, and serve. 

Terrine of Veal. 

Trim a white cushion of veal, lard it with ham and raw truffles, and sprinkle 
it well with pepper, salt and spices. Chop the trimmings of the veal with an 
equal quantity of lean fresh pork and mix with them an equal quantity of chopped 
fresh bacon and the trimmings of the truffles. Pound the mixture in a mortar, 
pass it through a fine hair-sieve into a basin, season it with salt and pepper, and 
mix in three or four tablespoonfuls of Madeira. Line a pie-terrine with thin 



COLD DISHES. 

layers of bacon, place a layer of prepared forcemeat at the bottom of it, then 
put in the larded cushion of veal and surround and cover it with the forcemeat, 
building it on the top in the shape of a dome. Stand the terrine in a baking- 
dish and place it in a moderate oven. Baste the terrine frequently, and in an 
hour's time pour a little warm water in the pan and bake it for an hour and a 
half longer. When cooked, remove the terrine from the oven and leave it for an 
hour and a half, then place a light weight on the top and leave till cool. Take 
the top off the terrine, remove the meat, cut it into slices, and place it back 
again. Stand the terrine on a round dish, garnish it with croutons of aspic jelly, 
and serve. 



Cold Beef Tongue. 



Boil a tongue for three hours; when cooked skin it, trim off the rough parts of 
the root and truss it in good shape by placing the root against some fixture and run- 
ning a fork through the thin end into the table or board; when cold finish trimming 
the tongue; place it on a dish, fix a frilled paper round the roots with skewers, wet it 
with a little hot jelly and garnish with parsley and chopped aspic. An imitation scal- 
lop shell may be carved on the tongue, commencing at the thin end and ending with 
the thick. Glaze it well with light glaze, spread a thick layer of aspic jelly over 
the tongue, and garnish it on the dish with skewers garnished with jelly and mush- 
rooms. 

Cold Calf's Tongue with Macedoine. 

Place six pickled tongues in a saucepan of boiling water and boil them until 
tender. Take them out, remove the skins, put them between two dishes and let them 
remain with a weight on the top until cold. Round them off at the root end, cut 
them flat at the sides and divide lengthwise in halves. Glaze with a pastebrush and 
mask with a thin layer of half-set aspic jelly to give a relief. In the meantime 
prepare a macedoine with carrots and potatoes formed in the shape of balls, Brussels 
sprouts, flowerets of cauliflowers, green or asparagus peas and French beans cut in 
diamond shapes. All of these vegetables must be blanched separately, well-seasoned 
and put in little piles of symmetrical size in the center of a dish. Arrange the halves 
of tongue round, with the points upwards, pour around a small quantity of aspic jelly 
and serve with tartar or ravigote sauce in a sauceboat. 



Salads 

Salads. 

Compound salads will be found described under their particular headings, such 
as Anchovy, Artichoke, Asparagus, Cress, etc. Other recipes are dealt with in the 
following list. 

The simplest form of salad would be made by wiping perfectly dry a few leaves 
of lettuce, cutting them into broad shreds, and then dressing them as follows : 

Place the lettuce in a deep salad bowl fitted with a pair of servers, one partaking 
of the character of a spoon, and the other that of a fork. Supposing the bowl to be 
about two-thirds full of the lettuce, and having ascertained that it is carefully dried, 
pour into the spoon four charges of the best lucca oil, and stir this freely into the 
leaves, stirring vigorously with both servers. Then dust in enough salt to season 
nicely ; pour into the spoon about one teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, fill the spoon 
up with the best malt vinegar, and stir this in briskly. The salad is then ready to be 
served. 

Salad Dressing. 

(i). Put the cold yolks of two hard-boiled eggs into a basin, mash them until 
they are quite smooth, add one teaspoonful each of salt and made mustard, one salt- 
spoonful of sugar, and half that quantity of pepper; mix together well, add by 
degrees one tablespoonful of cream and vinegar, and, when well incorporated, add 
one tablespoonful each of salad oil and vinegar, and one dessertspoonful of tarra- 
gon vinegar. When well mixed it is ready for use. 

(2.) Put the yolks of two raw eggs into a basin with one teaspoonful of salt 
and beat them well ; then add, a drop at a time, one pint of the best salad-oil. 
When the oil is well mixed with the eggs, stir in one teaspoonful of made mustard, 
one tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, one tablespoonful of chili vinegar, and three 
or four tablespoonfuls of plain vinegar. Beat together until all these ingredients are 
well incorporated, then add a small quantity each of sugar and cayenne pepper. 
Turn the mixture into a bottle, and keep it tightly corked until wanted. 



Cream Salad Dressing. 



Beat two or three raw eggs well, add one teaspoonful of sugar, one-half salt- 
spoonful of salt, the same of mustard, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar and finally one 
tablespoonful of cream. Put the dish containing these into a basin of boiling water 

418 



SALADS. 419 

and stir until the mixture becomes as thick as rich cream. The water in the bowl 
should be kept boiling all the time and it will then only take about five minutes to 
finish it. Remove the basin and allow it to get cool, when it will be ready for use. 

Cream Dressing for Cucumber Salad. 

To make this salad a success have some sour cream. Take five tablespoonfuls 
of sour cream, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, half a teaspoonful of paprika, one 
pinch of salt and half a teaspoonful of hashed up chives; mix it well, so that the 
paprika does not form little balls. When well mixed, add it to the cucumbers, 
and serve. 

Anchovy Salad. 

Fillet some anchovies and shred them lengthwise. Arrange them tastefully 
upon a small plate and garnish with groups of chopped hard eggs, chopped pars- 
ley and onions, ornamented with whole capers. Pour salad oil or oil and vinegar 
over the whole, and serve. 

Asparagus Salad, German Style. 

Take sufficient cold boiled asparagus points and place in a basin with one- 
third of their quantity of crayfish tails. Season with salt and pepper. Pass through 
a sieve the yolks of half a dozen hard-boiled eggs and beat up with a little oil, 
vinegar and salt to the consistency of cream. Pour this over the asparagus mix- 
ture and serve in a salad bowl. Almost any cold shellfish may be used in place 
of the crayfish if desired. 

Bacon Salad. 

Cut some slices of fat bacon into small squares, put them into a fryingpan 
and fry them until lightly browned. Remove the pan from the fire and mix in 
one-third vinegar to two-thirds bacon oil. Prepare a salad by chopping up what-

the mayonnaise dressing with the lobster, put a little of this in each cluster of leaves, 
and pour over a little more of the dressing. Garnish the border of the dish with 
whole leaves.

SALADS. 



427 



to cool until it can be handled, then remove it from the shell, using a can-opener to 
separate it; save all the coral, green fat, and flesh of the lobster. Throw away the 
intestine which runs through the flesh of the tail, the membranous sac which lies 
at the back of the eyes, the " dead men" or soft fins which lie under the small legs 
close to the body, and the shell, cutting the lobster into square pieces about one inch 
in size. While the lobster is being prepared boil two eggs hard, remove the shells, 
and cut them into quarters. Carefully wash and dry two medium-sized heads of 
lettuce, cut them into quarters and keep them in a cool place. Put into a saucepan 
four tablespoonfuls each of butter and vinegar, one mustard spoonful of made mustard, 
one-fourth saltspoonful of pepper, and one saltspoonful of salt, a sprinkling of 
cayenne and the lobster, and place the saucepan over the fire; arrange the lettuce 
round the sides of a salad-bowl, stir the lobster until it is hot, pour it into the salad- 
bowl, garnish with the hard-boiled eggs, and serve at once. The success of this salad 
depends upon the celerity with which it is made and served. 

(3). Remove the flesh from two freshly-boiled lobsters, keeping the shells 
(which should be nicely washed and reserved for further use) as whole as possible. 
Chop the flesh fine, and mix it with a good mayonnaise salad-dressing. Wash and 
cut some lettuces into thin shreds, pile them in the center of an oval-shaped salad 
dish, arrange round it a border of endive, and pour the mayonnaise mixture in the 
center. Cut some celery into pieces of various lengths, and arrange in fancy shaped 
groups against the endive. Garnish round all with croutons of aspic jelly. Place 
the shells of the lobsters on the top lengthwise, head to head, put across their backs 
some rounds of cucumber overlapping each other, and serve. 

Lobster Mayonnaise. 

Take the flesh from some lobsters and cut them to a small size. Have a border 
mould, and pour into it a layer of slightly melted pale-colored aspic jelly. When 
the jelly begins to set, place arounct and over some of the pieces of lobster and a few 
tarragon leaves, filling up with jelly. Put the mould in a cold place, and when the 
jelly is set turn the mould out onto a dish; fill the center with lettuce cut into shreds 
and mixed with the remainder of the lobster seasoned with pepper, salt, tarragon, 
vinegar and oil. Heap the lettuce and lobster high, and cover it with mayonnaise 
sauce. Garnish the heap of salad and the top of the mould with capers, stoned 
olives, tarragon, shervil, slices of hard-boiled eggs, slices of truffles, and the coral of

and mix with it one pint of chopped cold potatoes. Put a layer of this at the bottom 
of a salad-bowl, cover with parsley and salad dressing, and continue in this way until 
all the meat is used up. Place the bowl in a cool place for a couple of hours, and the 
salad is then ready for use. 

Mussel Salad. 

Wash the mussels and boil them until the shells open. When cooked drain 
them, remove the shells and put them into a hot dish. Melt one-fourth pound of 
butter, season with pepper, salt, lemon juice and a small quantity of Worcestershire 
sauce and pour it over the mussels. They should be eaten hot with some thin slices 
of brown bread and butter.

towel and cut them into slices about one-fourth inch thick; peel a medium-sized 
Spanish onion and slice it very thin. Arrange the sliced onion and tomatoes in layers 
in a salad-bowl and pour over them a plain salad dressing made by mixing together 
one teacupful of salad oil, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one-half teaspoonful of salt 
and one-half saltspoonful of pepper. Use the salad as soon as made. Young green 
onions may be used for this salad.

and one-half teacupfuls of salad oil; season with pepper and salt, toss the salad about 
to mix it, then serve with toasted crackers.

ters into a saucepan, boil and skim it, add a little vinegar, bruised peppercorns and 
salt. Put in the oysters and cook slowly for a few minutes until done, take them out 
and turn them into a basin packed in ice to cool; add a little oil and vinegar to the 
chopped celery and cabbage, spread some of it over a dish, arrange the oysters on it, 
putting them close together, cover with the remainder of the mixture, smooth it over 
with a knife, pour over a little mayonnaise sauce, and serve.

Pack a conical-shaped mould in ice and decorate the interior with anchovy fillets, 
poached whites of eggs, and gherkins cut in small pieces, and small French beans, all 
dipped in half-set aspic jelly to make them adhere to the mould. Cover all with a 
thin layer of the aspic jelly and let it set. Meanwhile prepare a salad of boiled beet- 
roots, potatoes and carrots (a little of each), as well as a few pickled button mush- 
rooms and capers, a little salted cucumber, and a few sticks of celery, all except the 
capers being cut up small; add a few fillets of anchovies or salted herrings, a small 
piece of any cooked fish, and a few crayfish tails, all cut up into small pieces. Put 
the whole into a basin, pour over sufficient mayonnaise sauce to make the mixture 
thick, pack the basin in ice, and allow the contents to cool. Turn the salad into the 
mould, let it remain in the ice for an hour, turn it out onto a dish, and serve with a 
garnish of small rolls cut in halves, and the center scooped out and filled with caviar. 

Salmon Salad. 

Remove the skin and bones from two salmon steaks that have been broiled; 
flake the flesh with two forks, put it into a basin, season it with pepper and salt, and 
moisten with lemon juice or vinegar, and a very little oil, the fish being oily itself. 
Soak it for an hour or so. Wash a head of lettuce in plenty of water, drain it well, 
pull the leaves apart, and put them in a salad-bowl ; drain the salmon, put it in with 
the lettuce, pour over it a mayonnaise dressing, garnish it tastefully with slices of 
hard boiled eggs, olives and anchovies, cut it into small fancy shapes, and serve. 

Salsify Salad.

twelve stoned olives and one tablespoonful of capers. The salad is then ready for 
use. > 

Sorrel Salad. 

Procure a quantity of sorrel, wash it well in several waters and place it on a sieve 
to drain; if the leaves are large break them in halves, but if small they can be left 
whole. Place the sorrel in a bowl with a variety of other salad plants (such as may 
be in season), the sorrel being too sour to eat alone, cover it with a salad dressing in 
which the vinegar is left out, and serve. Common field sorrel is excellent in vege- 
table salads mixed with leaves of dandelion and served with a bacon dressing. 



Spanish Salad. 



Bleach some heads of endive, and arrange them in a mound in the middle of 
a dish ; peel some rather large tomatoes, divide them into sections, and place them 
round the endive. Boil some eggs very hard, and when cold, shell and set them in 
a mortar after having cut them into halves and scooping out the yolks, being careful 
not to break the whites. Pick some shrimps or lobster, and put them in the mortar 
with the yolks, and pound to a paste. Fill the hollow of the whites with the paste 
and level it off at the top, and arrange them round the tomatoes. Strew some 
chopped shallot and sweet pepper over the endive; mix together in equal propor- 
tions some oil and vinegar: season the mixture with salt and pepper, and pour it over 
the salad. Serve at once. 



String Bean Salad. 



The string beans are to be boiled, cut up into diamond-shaped pieces and 
allowed to cool and drain well; mix them up with salt, pepper, oil, vinegar and a 
little ravigote sauce, turn the salad into a croustade made of paste, and serve cold. 

Tomato Salad. 

Pour boiling water over the required number of tomatoes, then drain them and 
remove the skins; leave until quite cold, then divide into sections. Put the tomatoes

into a salad-bowl, garnish with chopped tarragon leaves, pour a plain dressing of oil 
and vinegar seasoned with salt and pepper over them, and serve. A mayonnaise 
dressing can be used in place of a plain dressing, if preferred. 

Tomato and Artichoke Salad. 

Prepare a mixture or dressing of olive oil, vinegar, tarragon, chervil, salt and 
pepper. Have ready some boiled artichokes, cut them in slices, using the under part 
only, and also cut off an equal number of slices of tomatoes. Dip them into the 
dressing, arrange in a salad-bowl, pour over the dressing, and serve. 

Tomato and Cucumber Salad. 

Cover the bottom of a salad-dish with lettuce, place a layer of sliced cucumbers 
on the top, cover with a layer of slices of peeled tomatoes, pour over salad-dressing 
or mayonnaise sauce, and serve. 

Tomato Salad in Surprise. 

Peel a nice large tomato and empty its contents; then take some cold slaw and 
celery hashed up very fine and mix it with mayonnaise dressing, add a pinch of salt 
and a pinch of paprika peppei. Mix it well and fill the tomato with this mixture. 
The tomato must be served very cold so as to have this salad a success. Use one 
tomato for each guest 

Tomatoes with Mayonnaise. 

Raw tomatoes, peeled and sliced, are delicious with mayonnaise, which is made 
by mixing gradually three parts of oil and one of vinegar with the yolk of an egg, and 
adding a seasoning of salt and pepper. Mustard may also be added if liked. The 
egg and seasoning are put in the bottom of a bowl with a small quantity of vinegar 
and mixed to a smooth cream; the oil and vinegar are then added alternately, a few 
drops at a time, until the desired quantity of mayonnaise is obtained. It must be kept 
in a cool place until wantejd. 

Tongue Salad. 

Cut some cold boiled beef tongue into small thin strips, place them in a salad- 
bowl and add some chopped boiled potatoes and a small quantity of celery cut into 
pieces. Strew over the salad some finely-chopped parsley and baste it with a few ta- 
blespoonfuls of beef broth. Prepare a plain salad-dressing of oil and vinegar, sea- 
soned with salt and pepper and pour it over the salad, which place in the refrigerator. 
When ready to serve, garnish the salad with heart-leaves of lettuce. 



SALADS. 



Truffle Salad.

Pick out all the black spots from half a dozen white truffles, wash them thor- 
oughly, wipe them dry on a cloth and chop them up as fine as possible. Pour a 
little oil into a saucepan, add two or three fillets of anchovies rubbed through a 
fine sieve, make the oil hot, add the truffles and a little seasoning, remove the sauce- 
pan from the fire, toss it for a minute or two, turn the salad into a bowl, and serve. 



Truffle and Celery Salad. 



Cut some cooked truffles into slices, and then into quarters, stir them in with 
the hearts of a few roots of celery, also cut up into small pieces about three-fourths 
of an inch in length, put them into a salad-bowl, pour over a dressing composed of 
oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, and serve. 

Vegetable Salad. 

Boil some beet-root, celery and onions. When cold cut them into thick slices. 
Mix together one saltspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of made mustard, one des- 
sertspoonful of tarragon vinegar, and half a dozen drops of chili vinegar, and pour 
it over the vegetables. 

f ' Waldorf Salad. 

Peel two raw apples and cut them into small pieces, say about half an inch square, 
also cut some celery the same way, and mix it with the apple. Be very careful not 
to let any seeds of the apples be mixed with it. The salad must be dressed with a 
good mayonnaise. 

Watercress Salad. 

Select three bunches of fresh watercress, pare off the stalks, clean, dry in a cloth, 
place in a salad-bowl, seasoning with one-half pinch of salt, a little pepper, and two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar ; mix thoroughly, and serve. Watercress salad requires 
no oil. 



Vegetables. 



A great difficulty seems to exist among cooks and others in their efforts to 
define the distinction between vegetables and fruit. In a culinary sense the distinc- 
tion is somewhat simplified, the term vegetables being generally applied to those 
articles which have grown in or about the earth and are cooked, or dressed uncooked, 
as savories; fruits, on the contrary, are usually associated with sweets. Literally, the 
term vegetables, derived from the Latin vegetare, would include all things that 
grow from the earth as members of the vegetable kingdom; but in a more limited 
sense, the term vegetables might be applied to those edible growths that are included 
amongst our vegetable foods without being connected with the organs of vegetable 
reproduction, which are known, correctly speaking, as fruits. This difficulty of 
distinction is very patent when we remember that some fruits are, in a culinary sense, 
styled vegetables, among which are tomatoes, vegetable marrows, peas, beans, cu- 
cumbers, etc., etc. Then again, the stalks of leaves, known as rhubarb, are es- 
teemed as fruit amongst cooks. Nuts, again, which are, most correctly speaking, 
the fruit of the tree which bears them, are differently designated, when they are 
numbered amongst the dishes of a dessert. They are not vegetables, they are nuts. 

Whenever the vegetables are distinguished for their excellence the dinner is 
always particularly enjoyed; and if they are served with each dish, as they are 
most appropriate and fresh from the dressing, it would be a great improvement on the 
present style. With some meats, something of the kind is practiced, as peas with 
duck, and beans with bacon, and such combinations are generally favorites, but the 
system might be extended, and with great advantage. With respect to variety of 
vegetables, I think the same rule applies as to other dishes. I would not have many 
sorts on the same occasion, but would study appropriateness and particular excel- 
lence. This is a matter for study, and a field for genius. To the eye of the in- 
itiated nothing can be more ridiculous than to see an American dinner-plate heaped 
up with a confusion of vegetables, none of them any too well dressed, except the 
potato, which is always present, and generally good. 

From the foregoing remarks it is quite evident that the cooking of vegetables 
might be regarded as a distinct culinary art. In large establishments it is quite 
usual to engage a cook especially experienced in this department, who, acting under 
the chef, is known as the vegetable cook. That the duties attached to his office 
are exceedingly important, requiring considerable intelligence, will be understood 
from the following instructions: 

In the first place the cook should see that the vegetables are quite fresh, for, in 

434 



VEGETABLES. 435 

spite of anything that may be said to the contrary, all vegetables, whether roots, 
leaves, or any other kind, begin to lose bulk and flavor as soon as they are removed 
from the ground. Those that suffer the least in this respect are roots and tubers, 
such as carrots and potatoes, and those that suffer most are leaves, stalks and 
shoots, such as asparagus, cabbages and the like. 

To clean vegetables they should be first soaked for a time in salted water. In 
this way the flavor of the vegetables improves, and all insect life is removed. Next 
the dirt and grit must be thoroughly washed out, and for this purpose a wire sieve or 
basket should be used, which may be dipped again and again into a tub of water, the 
vegetables in it being shaken well and rinsed. Root vegetables offer the artistic cook 
a very extensive scope for the exercise of his skill and ingenuity, as may be seen 
from the various shapes and designs into which these vegetables may be cut. 
Flowers are frequently cleverly imitated, and rounds, olives, and lozenge shapes of 
every variety are to be seen in artistically prepared soups and garnishes. These re- 
quire special tools for their production, of which there are many in use. 

Artichokes Barigoule. 

Cut off about half an inch from the tops of the artichokes, trim off the leaves 
from the bottom and burn them. Wash thoroughly, put in a saucepan with a good 
supply of slightly-salted water and boil until quite tender. Take out, drain, and 
scoop out the slightly fibrous insides, and squeeze perfectly dry. Put the tops of 
the leaves into a fryingpan with a few tablespoonfuls of oil to fry them. Place a 
small quantity of grated bacon in a saucepan with a little flour and butter, adding a 
gill of prepared fine herbs, and pour over a little broth; put the saucepan over the fire 
and stir for five minutes. Place a small quantity of this mixture in each artichoke 
(previously seasoned with salt and pepper internally) and cover the opening with a 
thin slice of bacon, bind around with string to keep them in position, put into a saute- 
pan together with a little broth, set the pan in the oven and bake for twenty minutes. 
Arrange the cooked leaves on a dish, remove the string and bacon from the arti- 
chokes, place on the leaves, and serve. 

Artichokes Boiled Plain. 

Cut off the tips of the leaves and round off the bottoms, removing the stalk and 
trimming the under leaves away. Soak in salt and water, washing well. Boil them 
in salt and water until they are quite tender; the leaves come away readily when they 
are done. Use a large quantity of water for the boiling, as it helps to rid them of a 
slight bitterness prevalent, especially in the autumn. When cooked drain on a cloth, 
and then remove with a spoon the soft fibrous substance found inside, and which is 
sometimes termed the " choke." Then place once more in boiling water to heat up 
and take out again, drain and serve in a vegetable dish with a strainer, or upon a 
neatly-folded napkin. Serve with melted butter.

Puree of Artichokes. 

Dress and cook some artichoke bottoms as for a garnish, and then when they 
are soft remove, drain and cut them up. Place in a saucepan with an equal bulk of 
bechamel sauce, glaze and reduce the liquor, rubbing the whole through a fine sieve 
into a basin, mixing in a little hot cream and butter, and serve. 

Artichokes Raw. 

A poivrade composed of a mixture of pepper, oil, vinegar and salt is placed on a 
plate and the artichoke held in the left hand by the tips of the leaves, is cut into 
slices, successively from the bottom, to each slice is attached a leaf; then holding the 
leaf between the finger and the thumb, the sliced bottom is dipped into the poivrade 
and eaten. 

Stuffed Artichoke Bottoms. 

Trim, cut in quarters and cook the desired number of artichokes in the Italian 
style, and fill the center of each with a little chicken forcemeat mixed with d'uxelles 
sauce. Place in a sautepan with a little butter and put in an oven to poach the 
forcemeat. Then remove, arrange on a dish and serve, pouring a little half-glaze over 
them. 

Boiled Asparagus. 

Have the asparagus as fresh as possible, scrape and clean, washing thoroughly and 
tie with a string into bundles of five or six shoots each, taking care to have the 
head even so that the stalks may be cut off at the bottom leaving them of equal 
length. Place the bundles in boiling salt and water and boil them fast without the 
lid until tender; this will be from twenty minutes to half an hour; then have ready 
some slices of toast without crust and lay them for sippets at the bottom of the veg- 
etable dish. Take out the bundles of asparagus from the boiling water, using great 
care to prevent the heads from falling off. Lay them upon the toast and untie them 
upon it, allow the asparagus to fall so that it will be one wav upon the toast, and the 
sippet be moistened with the water of the asparagus. Melted butter with the juice 
of a lemon to every pint may be served separately in a boat or poured over it. Oiled 
butter is sometimes served with asparagus, especially in Paris and other continental 
cities. 

Asparagus Croustade. 

Carefully cut off a small piece of the end of three French rolls, and scrape out 
all the crumb with the handle of a spoon; put the tops and shells into a fryingpan 
with a little butter and fry them, or they may be placed before the fire to get crisp. 
Pour one breakfastcupful of cream into a saucepan, add the yolks of five eggs, and 
beat together for a few minutes, seasoning with a little salt and grated nutmeg. Set 



VEGETABLES. 437 

the saucepan on the fire and when the mixture begins to thicken, put in about seventy 
green parts of the asparagus, cut up into small pieces. Fill the rolls with this mixture, 
replace the lids or pieces of the tops that were cut off, and with a sharp-pointed 
stick or skewer make sufficient holes at one end of them to insert about ten more of 
the green parts of the asparagus. Then arrange them on a napkin placed on a dish, 
and serve. The pieces of asparagus projecting from the rolls will give the appearance 
of growing out of them. 

Asparagus, Pompadour. 

After washing, place the asparagus in a saucepan of salted boiling water, and 
boil until done. Take them out, cut them into lengths of about two inches, and place 
in a cloth near the fire to dry. Prepare a little sauce with vinegar, butter, yolk of 
egg, salt and pepper and place the asparagus on a dish, pour over the sauce, and serve. 

Asparagus with Cream. 

Cut into small pieces a bunch of asparagus and put in a saucepan of boiling 
water and blanch for about three minutes. Then remove, drain and put into another 
saucepan with a small quantity of warm water, some butter, sugar, and one onion. 
Set the pan on the side of the fire and simmer gently for half an hour, take out 
the onion, add a thickening of yolk of egg and cream, stir it well and turn the whole 
out onto a dish, and serve. 

Asparagus Tops with Cream. 

Cut off the points or heads of the desired quantity of asparagus, wash and drain 
them and place in a saucepan with a little warmed butter. Set the pan on the fire, 
stir in a little bechamel sauce, and when done remove, place on a dish, pour over the 
sauce, and serve. 

Boiled Black Beans. 

Place the beans in a basin of water and soak for three hours. Then place in a 
saucepan of water and boil for three hours; take out, drain and place in another 
saucepan with a few small pieces of bacon a little chutney, mushroom catsup, 
anchovy sauce and gravy, and cook well for half an hour. Turn out onto a dish, and 
serve with a garnish of boiled rice. 

Boiled Lima Beans. 

Shell the beans and throw them into cold water to remain there until they are 
wanted. An hour before they are required place them in boiling water, adding some 
salt, and boil them until tender, when drain off the water, add a little fresh butter, 
and serve.

Lima Beans Sauted. 

Use one quart of freshly-shelled lima beans, and parboil them in salted water for 
twenty minutes. Place them in fresh, cool water after draining, again drain them 
and put in a sautepan with a good-sized lump of butter, salt, pepper and nutmeg to 
taste. Cook for five minutes, tossing well, then moisten with some cream, adding a 
little chopped parsley, mix well together, and serve. 

Boiled String Beans. 

Take the fresh tender beans, break off the tops and bottoms carefully, stringing 
both sides, and paring the edges neatly ; wash in cold water and drain. Then place 
them in boiling salted water and cook for twenty minutes. Drain and return them to 
cold water, letting them get thoroughly cool. Lift out and dry. They are then 
ready to serve. 

String Beans, Bretonne. 

Cut some onions into dice-shaped pieces placing them in a saucepan together 
with a little butter, let cook to a golden color on the stove, say for five minutes, and 
add a very little flour. Stir well and moisten with some white broth, continuing the 
stirring until it comes to a boil, season with salt and pepper. Then add the cooked 
beans with a clove of crushed garlic to the sauce, cook for ten minutes, place on a hot 
dish, sprinkling over it a little chopped parsley, and serve. 

String Beans, English Style. 

Prepare the beans in the same manner as for the boiled string beans, keep them 
warm and of a light green color, put on a hot dish, pouring over them a little melted 
butter, and sprinkle some chopped parsley on top, serving very hot. 

String Beans Sauted in Butter. 

Take some tender string beans and parboil them in slightly salted water for a couple 
of minutes, drain them and place in a saucepan on a hot stove, adding a lump of butter 
and season with salt. Stir lightly with a wooden spoon, while cooking for three min- 
utes. When done, add a little finely-chopped parsley, place on a hot dish, and serve 

String Beans with Cream. 

Prepare the beans, and then place them in a saucepan of slightly salted water, 
boiling until quite tender. Meanwhile put the yolks of three or four eggs in a basin 
and beat them up with a little cream, adding some warmed butter, and beating well. 
Pour this mixture into a saucepan on the fire, and, when quite hot, mix in a little

vinegar together with the beans. After they have been drained, remove the pan to 
the side of the fire, and steam gently for six or seven minutes, stirring constantly. 
When done, turn out onto a dish, and serve at once. 



String Beans with Gravy. 



Put some string beans which have been cooked and allowed to become quite cold 
into a saucepan with a little chopped parsley and onions fried in butter, seasoning to 
taste with salt and pepper, and toss over the fire for about ten minutes. Then pour 
in sufficient stock and gravy from roasted meat to moisten and cook gently for fifteen 
minutes; skim off the beans and place on a dish, add the yolks of two or three eggs 
to the gravy to thicken it and pour over the beans, serving them hot. 

String Beans with Parsley and Butter. 

Place a good-sized lump of butter in a saucepan, sprinkle in a few green parsley 
leaves, add the beans, then stir until the butter is melted, the beans coated with it 
and the parsley is equally spread over them. Cover the pan over and place on side of 
the fire, cook for twenty minutes, and serve. 

White Beans and Boiled Pork. 

Select a suitable piece of pork, score the skiri and boil for half an hour. For 
each pound of meat, take one quart of beans that have been soaked over night in 
soft water. Place them in cold water on the stove to boil, and when they become 
soft, drain off the water and set the pork in a deep dish on a layer of the beans, cov- 
ering it nearly over with the remainder; and add a little warm water; then bake to a 
nice brown. A little moist sugar mixed with beans before placing them in the dish 
is considered an improvement by some. 

White Beans and Cream. 

Put a few mashed boiled onions in a saucepan with a little butter, grated nutmeg, 
salt and pepper; add the beans, stirring gently over the fire until they are hot but 
without boiling; they are then ready for serving. 

Stewed White Beans. 

Boil the beans until quite tender; remove the rind from some streaky bacon and 
cut into pieces an inch long and half an inch thick, scald for five minutes in boiling 
water, drain and put in a stewpan and stir over the fire until of a light brown color, 
then add a little flour and stir for a few minutes longer; add a cupful of claret wine 
and a little water, seasoning with pepper, and simmer for twenty-five minutes. Drain

the beans, place them in the stewpan with the bacon, adding a little butter, and toss 
over the fire till the butter is melted, and serve very hot. 

Baked Beet-Roots. 

After washing thoroughly place in a rather slow oven and when done serve hot 
with butter, pepper and salt. If baked whole they will probably require about eight 
hours to cook well. 

The Preparation of Beet-Roots for Table. 

Choose the small, smooth varieties; wash and clean them without cutting or 
scraping and boil for one to two hours, dependent upon their size. Allow them to 
cool and then peel, cut into slices and serve in a glass dish; or they may be mixed 
in a salad. 

Beet-Roots Sauted in Butter. 

Prepare as for boiled beet-roots, and when cooked and peeled cut into heart- 
shaped pieces, place in a sautepan with a lump of butter, season with pepper and 
sprinkle over a very little loaf sugar powdered. Cook on a stove for six minutes, 
carefully tossing them from time to time; then arrange on a hot dish, and serve. 

Beet-Roots with Cream. 

Boil some beet-roots, peel and let them become cold, then slice and put in a 
stewpan with a little good stock. Beat up the yolk of an egg with one quart of 
good cream and stir into the stock in which the beet-root has been warmed. Serve on 
a dish with the sauce poured over it. 

Boiled Brussels Sprouts. 

Wash well in salted water about two pounds of Brussels sprouts and pick them over 
well. Place on the fire in a saucepan filled with water a little salt and bicarbonate of 
soda; leave off the lid and boil fast till quite tender, say about twenty to twenty-five 
minutes. When done drain them and dry on a cloth, and put in a large sautepan a good- 
sized lump of butter and a little salt and pepper, and toss the sprouts in this until they 
become quite hot again, but do not fry them. They may be served on a quartered 
round of buttered toast or separately, as desired. 

Brussels Sprouts, Maitre d' Hotel. 

Boil the sprouts to be used and then place them in a large saucepan with a lump 
of butter and heat them well. Put a half pound of fresh butter n a pan with 
two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, the juice of a couple of lemons, a little salt 



VEGETABLES. 441 

and white pepper, and mix together well with a spatula, and when it boils stir quickly. 
Place the sprouts on a dish and turn' the sauce over them. 

Brussels Sprouts Sauted. 

One pound of Brussels sprouts should be thoroughly washed and boiled, and 
then put into a pan over the fire, together with a good-sized lump of butter, a little 
salt, and tossed for eight minutes. Sprinkle over them a little chopped parsley, and 
serve, when done. 

Brussels Sprouts Sauted with Cream. 

One pound of sprouts should be carefully pared, picked and blanched; drain and 
put into a sautepan and two tablespoonfuls of veloute sauce; season with a little salt, 
pepper and nutmeg, and add half a breakfast cupful of sweet cream. Heat well, but 
do not allow them to come to a boil for five to six minutes, tossing them frequently 
to prevent burning. Dress them on a hot dish, and serve. 

Cabbage and Cream. 

Take a well blanched cabbage, drain, cool and chop it up fine, placing it in a 
saucepan with a couple of ounces of butter, a little salt, pepper and grated nutmeg; 
add a tablespoonful of flour, stirring well, and then pour in a breakfast cupful of 
cream. Reduce until the cabbage and cream are thoroughly mixed, say about forty- 
five minutes; arrange on a hot dish, and serve. 

Boiled Cabbages. 

Remove the outside leaves of the cabbages and place in salted water to cleanse 
them, then put them into a saucepan of boiling water salted, and boil fast; do not use 
a lid for the saucepan. When done, strain well, cut into quarters, serving them at 
once. When boiling it is well to change the water every ten minutes, as this produces 
a better flavor. 

Stuffed Cabbage. 

Procure a large head of cabbage, boil it but not quite tender; then very care- 
fully take out the middle and fill the cavity with a mixture of a tablespoonful of 
minced suet, two tablespoonfuls of bacon or ham, a like amount of cold meat, one 
raw egg, the grated rind of a lemon, a little grated nutmeg, and pepper and salt to 
taste. Milk may be used instead of the egg if desired. Tie with the string and put 
the cabbage in the oven, baking it for twenty minutes. Place on a dish and pour 
some rich brown gravy around it, but not over it. The cabbage should be frequently 
basted with dripping or butter, and must not be allowed to burn or become brown. 



442 VEGETABLES. 

Cabbage with Cream. 

Clean two cabbages and boil until soft, then remove them from the water and 
drain, pressing well until dry. Chop up fine and place them in a stewpan in which 
an ounce of butter had been melted, add pepper and salt to taste. Place the whole 
over the fire for two or three minutes, stirring frequently. When quite hot sprinkle 
a handful of flour over, adding gradually half a pint of milk or cream. Mix together 
thoroughly, and serve. 

Boiled Pickled Red Cabbage with Oysters. 

Place the pickled cabbage in a bowl of boiling water and soak for ten to twelve 
minutes. Then remove and drain it dry, rubbing well with a cloth, put it into a 
saucepan with a small quantity of dripping and stock and sprinkle over a little coarse 
black pepper and boil it until done, when place it in a circle around a dish, filling in 
the center with stewed oysters, and serve. 

Stewed Red Cabbage. 

Wash well a head of red cabbage, cut the leaves apart, trimming off all tough 
parts; peel and slice one onion, put it over the fire in a saucepan with a tablespoonful 
of butter, a breakfast cupful of cold gravy, and half a saltspoonful of pepper, and two 
teaspoonfuls of salt. Put in the cabbage, four tablespoonfuls of vinegar over it and 
cover the pan closely. Cook gently for an hour or until the cabbage is tender, 
stirring occasionally, and serve hot. 

Baked Cardoons with Breadcrumbs. 

Blanch and boil a sufficient number of cardoons; place them on a dish well 
buttered and sprinkled with grated bread, cover them with breadcrumbs, pour over 
sufficient warm butter to moisten, and brown the surface either with a salamander or 
in the oven. When done, take out the cardoons, and serve. A little grated cheese 
may also be sprinkled over with the breadcrumbs. 

Cardoons, Spanish Style. 

Secure some very white heads of cardoons, cut each leaf into slices six inches in 
length (with the exception of the hollow ones which are tough and thready), and 
remove all the prickles. Place the thickest leaves in a saucepan of boiling water, and 
boil them for a few minutes, then put in the leaves of the heart, turn the middle stalks 
into olive shapes, put them into the boiling water, and blanch them also; try a 
piece in cold water to see whether the slime which is on the surface will come off by

rubbing; if so, take them off the fire immediately, refresh them in cold water, wash 
and rub this all off. Prepare a sauce as follows: Cut about half a pound of fat bacon, 
and a small piece of beef suet into large squares; put these into a saucepan with two 
ounces of butter, half a lemon cut into thin slices, a small lump of salt, and as much 
water as may be necessary to cover the cardoons when they are added. Stew this for 
half an hour, then throw in the cardoons and boil them up once, and leave in. When 
ready to use the cardoons, trim them at both ends, put them in a stewpan with one 
teacupful each of Spanish sauce and broth, and a small quantity of both sugar and 
salt; then boil over a sharp fire so as not to cook them too much, keeping the fat 
well skimmed off. When cooked arrange the cardoons on a hot dish, strain the sauce 
over them, and serve without delay. 

Cardoons with Beef Marrow. 

Take some cardoons prepared as in cardoons for garnish, arrange them in a silver 
saucepan, and pour over a little Spanish sauce. Blanch some beef marrow by placing 
it in boiling water, take it out, drain, and spread on pieces of toast cut about a quarter 
of an inch thick, two inches long and an inch wide ; sprinkle these over with salt, 
glaze, and put them in a hot oven for four or five minutes. Arrange the cardoons on 
a dish, place the pieces of toast on top, and serve. 

Cardoons with Cheese. 

Take the outside leaves from five cardoons, string the white parts, and cut into 
small pieces ; put in a saucepan with one pint of port wine, cook on a slow fire until 
tender. Season to taste, and add one ounce of butter rolled in flour. Put the whole 
in a dish, squeeze over the juice of an orange, and sprinkle over four ounces of grated 
cheese. Brown the surface with a salamander, or in the oven. Serve as hot as 
possible. 

Cardoons with Veloute Sauce. 

Cut the leaves of the cardoons into slices, with the exception of the tough hollow 
ones, and remove all the prickles. Place the thickest leaves in a saucepan of boiling 
water, boil them for a few minutes, and then put in the leaves of the heart ; trim the 
middle stocks into large olives, and after blanching them put them in also. Rub a 
piece of the cardoons in cold water in order to determine whether the slime will 
come off easily, and if so, throw in the lot and rub them well. When quite clean, 
put the cardoons in white sauce, and boil them. Then remove the cardoons, put 
them in a stewpan with some stockbroth, and boil them quickly. When cooked, put 
them on a hot dish, drain them, pour over some hot veloute sauce, and serve. If pre- 
ferred, French melted butter can be used in place of the sauce veloute.

Carrot Fritters. 

Beat into pulp a large boiled carrot, pass it through a sieve and mix in two table- 
spoonfuls of cream, stirring in two well-beaten eggs. Put a piece of lard in a fry- 
ingpan, and when this is hot, shape the mixture into fritters and fry them. When 
done, place them on a hot dish and serve with brown sauce. 

Carrots, Housekeeper's Style. 

Peel some young carrots and leave them in cold water for a short time; slice 
them thin and put them into a stewpan half full of good broth, season with salt, 
pepper, mace and a bunch of sweet herbs and parsley, and stew until they are tender. 
When done, put them on a dish. Mix some flour with a little liquor in a cup, stir it 
in with the other and add a piece of butter and a little browning. When thick, pour 
it over the carrots, and serve. 

Carrots, Maitre d' Hotel. 

Scrape a number of carrots, cut them in halves lengthwise and boil them in 
salted water. When they are tender, take them out of the water, place them in a 
stewpan with a lump of butter, some chopped parsley, pepper, salt and sugar, 
squeezing the juice of a lemon over them. Toss them about over a moderate fire for 
a few minutes then pour them on a hot dish, and serve. 

Mashed Carrots. 

Scrape and wash some carrots, cut them in quarters lengthwise and boil till ten- 
der in broth. When they are done, strain, pass them through a sieve and season 
with pepper and salt, and add a lump of butter. Fill some cups or moulds with the 
pulp, press it down tightly and then turn them out. This is a very tasty form of 
serving carrots. 

Carrots, Poulette Style. 

Wash and scrape the required number of carrots, place them in a bowl of 
boiling water to scald. Take them out, drain, slice, put them into a saucepan of 
boiling- water with a bit of butter in it, and boil until they are done and quite tender. 
Put a little flour and butter into a fryingpan, cook for a few minutes, sprinkle in salt and 
pepper to taste, and add a little lemon juice, the yolks of two eggs and some rich stock. 
Then place the carrots in it and toss them over the fire so as to cook without boiling. 
Turn the whole out onto a dish, and serve. 

Carrots Stewed in Sugar and Cream. 

Scrape and clean six or eight large, sound carrots, put them into a saucepan of 
water and boil until they are done and nearly all the water is absorbed or evaporated. 



VEGETABLES. 445 

Mash the carrots, pour in a little milk and one tablespoonful of potato flour, a few 
dried orange flowers and a very little sifted crushed loaf-sugar; stir in a sufficient 
number of eggs to thicken, using three yolks to two whites, and whipping them well 
with warmed butter. Heat the mixture in the oven until it is of the required consist- 
ence, then turn it out onto a dish, and serve very hot with powdered sugar sprinkled 
over. 

Carrots with Fine Herbs. 

Wash and scrape about three large carrots, cut them into thick slices, put them 
into a saucepan with a lump of salt and plenty of cold water, and boil until they are 
tender. Put a small lump of butter into a saucepan, place it over the fire until 
melted, then put in a small finely-chopped onion, and toss it about over the fire until 
it is browned. Pour a pint of water, or clear broth, over the onion and boil it for five 
minutes. Drain the carrots and put them in with the onion, add about one dessert- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, and boil for three or four minutes longer. Remove 
the carrots from the fire, squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, and season to taste with 
salt and pepper. Turn the stew onto a hot dish, garnish with croutons of fried 
bread, and serve. 

Boiled Cauliflower, 

Trim off the leaves of a sound, firm head of cauliflower and wash it well in plenty 
of cold water in which a handful of salt has been dissolved. If any insects are visible 
between the branches of the cauliflower let it soak in salted water, with the flowerets 
down, for an hour or so, as the salt will kill the insects and they will fall down into 
the water. About three-quarters of an hour before serving put two tablespoonfuls of 
butter, one teaspoonful of salt, and one-fourth teaspoonful of white pepper into a 
saucepan large enough to hold the cauliflower; take from it the salted water, put it 
at once into the saucepan without draining it, cover carefully, set it over a slow fire, 
and let simmer until tender, which will be in about half an hour. Then without 
breaking the cauliflower take it up on a hot dish, let the butter and water in which it 
was cooked boil rapidly for a minute or so, then pour it over the cauliflower, and 
serve. If a thick sauce is desired, mix one teaspoonful of flour or cornstarch dis- 
solved in one teacupful of water with the butter and water, boiling it constantly for 
two minutes, stirring frequently, and then serve it with the cauliflower. After it is 
carefully washed the cauliflower may be boiled till it is tender, and then drained and 
served with white sauce; or covered with sauce and breadcrumbs and browned in a 
hot oven; or when the heads are small and defective, either boiled or served in 
branches instead of whole, or mashed through a colander, and heated with pepper, 
salt and butter. Cold boiled cauliflower is very palatable fried plain in butter, or 
broken in branches and served; or mashed and fried, with the adding of an egg, and 
salt and pepper.

Boiled Cauliflower, American Style. 

Pluck off the outside leaves and soak in cold salted water, top downwards for an 
hour to thoroughly cleanse it; then tie it in a twine bag to prevent breaking, and cook 
in salted boiling water for about twenty minutes, or until quite tender. If it is not 
boiled in a bag, remove the scum before it settles on the cauliflower. Serve in a 
shallow dish and cover it with a cream of hollandaise sauce, or add a little grated 
cheese; cover with cracker-crumbs moistened in melted butter and bake until the 
crumbs are done brown, or when cold, serve as a salad with mayonnaise dressing. 

Cauliflower Fritters. 

Cut into equal-sized pieces two well-boiled cauliflowers, dip each piece into thick 
yellow or white sauce, and place them one side to cool. Take them out with a spoon, 
put them into a basin of frying-batter, plunge them into a fryingpan of boiling fat and 
fry to a good color. Serve very hot on a napkin spread over a dish. If it is pre- 
ferred, the pieces of cauliflower may be dipped into vinegar, oil, salt and pepper 
mixed together in place of the batter, and then fried. 

Gratinated Cauliflowers. 

After trimming off the leaves of two or three cauliflowers, leaving only the cen- 
ters, boil them in water until they are about two-thirds done ; then remove, drain and 
divide into sprigs or natural sections. Place a layer of these on the bottom of a 
baking-dish, cover them with a sauce made of melted butter in which grated Par- 
mesan and Gruyere cheese have been mixed, and keep on in this way with the layers 
until the dish is full. Sprinkle a small quantity of cheese on the top, and then a few 
breadcrumbs or grated bread, pour over the top a little melted butter, and bake in a 
moderate oven until done and of a good cofor. If the cheese is not desired, it may be 
entirely discarded ; but if it is used it should be mixed with the sauce and not simply 
grated on the top. Care must be taken to see that every portion of the cauliflower is 
covered with the sauce. 

Cauliflowers in Mayonnaise. 

Select some large cold boiled cauliflowers and break them into small branches, 
adding a little salt, pepper and vinegar to properly season; then heap them on a dish 
so that they will form a point. Surround the dish with a garnish of cooked carrots, 
turnips and green vegetables, pour some white mayonnaise sauce over all, and serve. 

Mashed Cauliflowers. 

After boiling two cauliflowers cut the heads up into small branches. Put one 
teaspoonful of chopped onion into a saucepan with a small piece of butter and place 



VEGETABLES. 447 

the pan on a slow fire for about fifteen minutes; then throw in the cauliflowers and 
beat well with a wooden spoon; put in ten or a dozen tablespoonfuls of good white 
broth and one tablespoonful of flour and boil for fifteen or twenty minutes longer, 
adding one teaspoonful of sugar and one-half teaspoonful of salt. Pass the mixture 
through a sieve into another stewpan, add about a gill of cream or milk, and serve. 
If it is too thick add more milk. 

Stewed Cauliflower. 

Divide into branches or sprigs two or three cauliflowers and put these into hot 
water for three minutes to scald; then drain, put them into a saucepan, cover over 
with stock, sprinkle over a little grated nutmeg and boil them until they are done. 
Take them out, drain, put them into a sautepan with a small quantity of butter and 
some finely-chopped parsley and toss the pan for a few minutes over a brisk fire. 
Turn them onto a dish, and serve while very hot. 

Cauliflower with Cream Sauce. 

In the usual way cauliflower takes from thirty to forty-five minutes to cook, and 
it should not be allowed to boil rapidly or it will destroy the small flowerets. Test 
the stems with a fork, and remove as soon as tender. Put a piece of bicarbonate of 
soda the size of a bean into the water, and this will hasten the cooking without injur- 
ing the cauliflower. Divide the cauliflower into portions of convenient size before 
cooking, and when drained and dished up pour one or two tablespoonfuls of strained 
cream-sauce over each portion 

Cauliflowers with Parmesan Cheese. 

Take a cauliflower and break it into tufts, wash these thoroughly and put them 
into salted boiling water, but do not allow them to cook too soft. When cooked put 
each piece into warmed butter first and then strain them into grated Parmesan cheese, 
seasoned with dry mustard, pepper and salt. Place the pieces neatly together on a 
dish, pour over a little warmed butter, and bake in a hot oven for five minutes. When 
done, serve immediately. 

Boiled Celery. 

j 

Trim off all outside pieces, and suppress the roots of three heads of celery, cut 
them into lengths of six inches each, wash well and tie together. Cover them with 
boiling water in a saucepan, add a piece of mace, some peppercorns, an onion, and a 
little salt, and then boil. Put one tablespoonful of flour and one tablespoonful of 
butter into a saucepan, and when it is melted add sufficient water to that in which 
the celery was boiled to make the sauce. Beat the yolk of an egg With the juice of a 
lemon, and when the sauce is off the fire stir it in, adding a pinch of salt. When the 



44 8 VEGETABLES. 

celery is done, place it on a dish, cut off the string that fastens it together, and pour 
over the sauce. 

Braised Celery. 

Select a few heads of celery, and trim each stalk, leaving nothing but the white 
part; then tie them in bundles and parboil them for about ten minutes, next throwing 
them into cold water. After a few minutes remove and drain them on a sieve ; place 
them in a stewpan with some good white stock, and let simmer gently for about an 
hour. When done drain them upon a napkin, and dish up upon croutons of fried 
bread. Pour over some good brown sauce to which has been added a little chicken 
glaze, and serve. 

Fried Celery. 

Boil two or three sound, well-trimmed heads of celery till they are about half 
cooked, or a trifle more ; remove, drain thoroughly, cut them into short lengths, dip 
them in batter, and fry in hot fat to a light brown. If it is well done this dish is 
very tasty; but it is useless to attempt it without a deep fryingpan, and plenty of oil 
or fat to fry in. 

Stewed Celery. 

Trim a few heads of celery, and blanch them in boiling water, drain, and place 
them in cold water. Take them out when cold and drain all the water from them 
without squeezing. Place them in a pan with a little consomme or stock broth and 
one teaspoonful of moistened sugar, and allow them to stew for an hour and a half; 
then pour over them four tablespoonfuls of bechamel or veloute sauce; strain the 
whole through a strainer, and set in a bain-marie. When it is ready to serve, add to 
the sauce a little thick cream, which will enrich and make it white. 

Celery with Marrow. 

Wash and trim ten or a dozen heads of celery and put them in boiling water to 
blanch for ten minutes; then drain, put them into a stewpan, cover with white stock 
and allow them to boil gently until they are done and tender. Then drain again, 
dress them on thin slices of toasted bread on a dish with four large pieces of boiled 
marrow around and pour over one pint of good brown sauce. Previously reduce the 
sauce with one-half pint of the sauce in which the celery was stewed, adding a little 
sugar to season it. 

Cepes in Shells. 

Select some small sound cepes, mince the heads, place them in a fryingpan with 
a small lump of butter and fry them gently, tossing them about, season to taste, 
throw in a small bunch of sweet herbs, and when the moisture has evaporated put in 
a few tablespoonfuls of bechamel sauce that has been reduced until it is of a creamy 



VEGETABLES. 449 

mixture. Fill some silver shells with the above, level the surface with a knife-blade 
and sprinkle on some grated breadcrumbs; baste each with a tablespoonful of warm 
butter and brown them under a salamander or in an oven. When the surface is 
glazed over arrange the shells on a folded napkin or an ornamental dish-paper, and 
serve. A few sprigs of fried parsley improves the appearance of the dish. 

Boiled Chestnuts Served as a Vegetable. 

Peel off the outside skin of the chestnuts and steep them in boiling water 
until the skin can be quickly and easily removed, throwing them as they are peeled 
into a bowl of cold water. Put two ounces of butter into a saucepan with two table- 
spoonfuls of flour and stir the whole over the fire until well mixed. Then pour in 
one-half pint or more of clear broth (according to the quantity of chestnuts), and 
continue to stir over the fire until boiling. Season the sauce with salt, throw in the 
chestnuts and keep them simmering at the side of the fire until soft. When served in 
this way they make a good vegetable for roasted meats or poultry, particularly 
turkey. 

Boiled Corn. 

Choose short, thick ears of fresh corn ; remove all the husks except the inner 
layer; strip that down in order to remove all the silk from the corn and to permit the 
removal of any defective grains, and then replace it, and tie at the upper end of each 
ear of corn. Have ready a large pot half full of boiling water, put in the corn, and 
boil steadily for about twenty minutes if the ears are large, or fifteen minutes if they 
are only of medium size; then take from the boiling water, remove the strings; serve 
hot at once. If it seems desirable to strip off the inner husk just before sending to 
the table, this must be done very quickly and the corn covered with a clean napkin 
or cloth to prevent the escape of heat. Serve plenty of butter, salt and pepper with 
the corn. Sometimes these latter are mixed, by heating them, together, and then 
served in a gravy-bowl. The fresher the corn the sweeter it is. It seems to lose its 
most delicate flavor after having been gathered for a few hours. 

Corn Cakes. 

Mix thoroughly together one quart of Indian corn removed from the ear with a 
coarse grater, two teacupfuls of new milk, one teacupful of flour, and two well-beaten 
eggs; season the batter with salt and pepper, and bake in cakes upon a griddle. 
The corn should be in a condition most suitable for roasting or boiling. This is a 
very nice dish. 

Corn Fritters. 

Prepare four ears of fresh corn by removing the outer husks and silks; boil, 
then drain well, cut the grains from the cobs to place in a bowl, season with salt and

pepper, add one-fourth pound of sifted flour, two eggs and one-half pint of cold 
milk. Stir vigorously, but do not beat, with a wooden spoon for five minutes, when 
it will be sufficiently firm. Butter a fryingpan, place it on the fire, then take a ladle 
holding one gill, and with this put the preparation into the pan in twelve parts, being 
careful that they do not touch one another, and let them get a good golden color, 
cooking for four or five minutes on each side. Dress them on a folded napkin, and 
serve. 

Grated Corn. 

Place the necessary number of ears of Indian corn in a saucepan and boil 
them. Grate off the cob, add a little butter, salt and cream, put the mixture into a 
dish, and serve like a vegetable. 

Mashed Corn. 

Wash and drain about one quart of fresh corn cut from the cob, put it into a 
saucepan with two quarts of boiling water, a bunch of thyme, two or three small 
onions, one carrot, two or three cloves, and salt and pepper to taste. Boil the corn 
until tender, then pour it onto a fine wire sieve, remove the onions, thyme, parsley, 
carrot and cloves. Return the corn to the saucepan with a small quantity of rich 
broth and two ounces of butter, and stir all together over the fire for a few minutes. 
Serve the puree very hot. 

Roasted Corn. 

Remove the silks and husks from one dozen ears of corn, rub them with butter, 
season with pepper and salt, lay them in a drippingpan, and place the pan as close 
as possible to a clear hot fire. Turn the ears now and then, and change their position 
in the pan so that all may cook evenly. When they are browned, serve hot. 

Corn Stewed with Cream. 

Select half a dozen ears of Indian corn, remove the silk and outer leaves and 
place them in a saucepan covering with water, cook, drain and cut off the corn from 
the cobs with a sharp knife, being very careful that none of the cob adheres to the 
corn, and place it in a stewpan with one teacupful of hot bechamel sauce, one-half 
breakfast cupful of cream and about one-fourth ounce of butter. Season with pepper 
and salt and a little grated nutmeg. Cook gently on the stove for five minutes, place 
it in a hot dish, and serve. 

Cucumbers as Cardoons. 

Quarter some cucumbers lengthwise, scrape out the seeds and slit the outsides 
so that they may resemble cardoons. Blanch them in boiling water, stew in strong 
broth with two or three tablespoonfuls of Spanish sauce and boil over a sharp fire. 
Should the broth taste bitter, put in a little piece of sugar. Serve hot. 



VEGETABLES. 451 

Cucumbers, Bechamel. 

Take one or two cucumbers; remove the peel and seeds, cut into slices, blanch 
in hot salted water, drain and plunge them into cold water; take them out and dry. 
Pour some bechamel sauce into a saucepan on the side of the fire, warm the slices of 
cucumber in it without letting the sauce boil. Turn the whole out on a dish, and serve. 

Cucumbers, French Style. 

Peel a green cucumber, slice it very thin, put in a basin with half an ounce of 
salt, and pickle for four hours. Drain well and arrange the slices on a dish with pep- 
per, oil, vinegar and one tablespoonful of chopped herbs, such as parsley, chervil and 
tarragon put over the slices. 

Fried Cucumbers. 

Select two or three cucumbers; cut into thick slices and remove the seeds; then 
place them in a deep dish with salted water slightly acidulated with vinegar and let 
them soak for about an hour. Take them out and dry and drain on a cloth, then fry 
in boiling lard until a light brown; drain, and they are ready for use. They are gen- 
erally used for brown stews. 

Stewed Cucumbers. 

Peel some cucumbers, split them lengthwise in four pieces each, scoop out the 
seeds, and wash; cut into smaller pieces and place in a saucepan of boiling water with 
a lump of salt, and boil till tender; drain and dry on a cloth. Into a stewpan put 
two ounces of butter with two tablespoonfuls of flour, stir over the fire until well 
mixed; then put in the pieces of cucumber, moisten nearly to height with broth, 
season with salt, pepper and a small quantity of grated nutmeg, and stir the whole 
over the fire until the liquor has reduced to the required thickness. When ready, take 
the saucepan off the fire, place it at the side, and stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs 
and a few drops of vinegar.

Boiled Eggplant. 

Peel the eggplants, cut them into moderate-sized pieces, put them into a saucepan 
of boiling water with a lump of salt, a pinch of parsley, and an onion stuck with two 
or three cloves, and boil them until tender. Prepare the following sauce: Put one 
ounce of butter into a small stewpan with one-third tablespoonful of flour, and mix it 
over the fire; then stir in a small bottle of tomato sauce, and keep on stirring until 
boiling, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. When cooked, drain the eggplant, 
place them on a hot vegetable dish, pour the sauce over, and serve while very hot.

Boiled Eggplant with Parmesan Cheese. 

Peel the eggplant, cut it into halves lengthwise, and scoop out the seeds; then 
cut them into convenient lengths, place them in a saucepan of boiling water with 
a lump of salt, an onion stuck with three or four cloves, and a bunch of parsley, and 
boil them until tender. Prepare the following sauce: Mix well one ounce of butter 
and one tablespoonful of flour in a stewpan over the fire; then mix in gradually one- 
half pint of boiling water, and stir over the fire for five minutes, then move it to the 
side and stir in the juice of a small lemon. When the eggplant is cooked, drain it well, 
put it on a hot dish, with some pieces of toast underneath, pour the sauce over, and 
serve. 

Broiled Eggplant. 

Peel an eggplant and cut it into six slices half an inch thick ; put them in a dish 
and season with salt and pepper and pour over one tablespoonful of sweet oil. Mix 
well, arrange the slices on a broiler and broil for five minutes on each side. Remove 
them from the fire, place on a hot dish, spread over a gill of maitre d'hotel sauce, and 
serve. 

Fried Eggplant. 

Select a nice large eggplant, peel it, remove the seeds and cut it into pieces 
about one and one-half inches long and three-fourths of an inch wide. Put these on 
a plate, sprinkle them well with salt, and leave for an hour or two. Afterward put 
them on a cloth, twist it round and wring it well to extract as much juice as possible 
from the plant, but do not squeeze the pieces hard enough to break them. Sprinkle 
them over with flour, seeing that each piece is well covered, and place them in a fry- 
ing-basket. Put a large lump of fat in a stewpan, and when boiling put it in the 
basket. As each piece of plant is nicely browned take it out of the basket, sprinkle 
it lightly with salt, and lay it on a sheet of paper in front of the fire for a minute or 
two, to drain as free from fat as possible. Spread a napkin over a hot dish, lay the 
eggplant on it, and serve. 

Fried Eggplant with Parmesan Cheese. 

Peel the eggplant, cut it into quarters lengthwise, scoop out the seeds and cut it 
into convenient lengths. Rub a stewpan over with garlic, put in a large lump of 
butter, and melt it ; then put in the pieces of eggplant, season to taste with salt, 
pepper, and a small quantity of grated nutmeg, and toss them about over the fire. 
Before the eggplant is quite done put in plenty of grated Parmesan cheese, and add 
more butter if necessary. When quite tender turn the eggplant onto a hot dish, 
with the cheese over it, garnish with sippets of hot buttered toast, and serve.

small fritters, put them in boiling fat, and fry both sides until brown. 

Eggplant, Lyonnese. 

Peel the eggplant and cut it into round slices about one-third of an inch thick. 
Peel and slice a couple of onions, place them in a stewpan with plenty of butter and 
fry them until lightly browned; then put in the slices of eggplant, season to taste 
with salt, pepper and grated nutmeg, pour over a small quantity of stock and stew 
gently until tender. When cooked, stew a moderate quantity of finely-minced pars- 
ley over the eggplant, turn it onto a hot dish with the sauce over it, and serve. 

Mashed Eggplant. 

Place in a dish a large onion cut in slices; add two green peppers also cut in 
slices, squeeze over the juice of a sweet lime and soak for several hours. Put into a 
quick oven a couple of fine young eggplants and roast them; take them out when 
done, open and scoop out as much of the inside as possible. Put this into a basin; 
add one teaspoonful each of salt, mustard and oil and work the whole to a pulp, cast- 
ing out all the lumps. Then add the onions and peppers and as much of the lime 
juice as required. After mixing thoroughly, the preparation is ready for use. 



Eggplant, Poulette Style. 



Peel the eggplant, cut it in halves, remove the seeds and cut it into small pieces. 
Put a large lump of butter in a stewpan to melt, put in the pieces of eggplant, toss them 
about for a few minutes, season to taste with salt and pepper and pour over them a 
small quantity of clear broth. Let them stew over a gentle fire until quite cooked, 
then move the stewpan to the side of the fire and stir in a moderate quantity of finely- 
minced parsley, with the yolk of an egg that has been beaten up with the juice of 
half a lemon and strained. Lay the pieces of eggplant on a hot dish, pour the sauce 
over them, and serve. 



Stewed Eggplant. 



Peel some young, tender eggplant, and cut them into convenient-sized pieces: 
put them in a saucepan with a good-sized lump of butter, season to taste with salt 
and pepper, and toss them over the fire for a quarter of an hour, then pour in as much 
plain stock freed from fat as will reach to half their height, and boil them gently

until they are quite tender. Move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and stir in 
quickly the yolk of an egg that has been well beaten with the juice of a lemon and 
strained, and add about one tablespoonful of finely-minced parsley. Place some 
slices of hot buttered toast onto a hot dish, turn the eggplant onto it, and serve at 
once. 

Stewed Eggplant with Onions. 

Take an eggplant, cut it into thin slices lengthwise, dust them over with salt and 
let them remain until the bitter juice is extracted; then drain and put them in a fry- 
ingpan with olive oil or butter, and brown over a brisk fire. Take them out of the 
pan and lay them at the bottom of a baking-dish. Peel four medium-sized onions, cut 
them in slices and put them in the fryingpan, adding more olive oil or butter if required, 
and fry until browned. Lay the onions over the eggplant, season with salt and three 
teaspoonfuls of sugar, pour in one teacupful of water and half that quantity of vine- 
gar, and set the pan over a slow fire. When the moisture is nearly all absorbed, 
arrange the eggplant and onions on a hot dish, and serve. 



Stuffed Eggplant. 



Wash and dry six eggplant; cut off the tops without detaching, so they will 
serve as lids. Scoop out all the insides and season inwardly with salt and pepper. 
Take one medium-sized onion, peel and chop very fine and put in a saucepan with 
half an ounce of butter and cook for three minutes over a brisk fire, taking care not 
to brown it; add six chopped mushrooms and one ounce of sausage meat, season with 
salt and pepper and cook for three minutes longer, stirring constantly. Now put in 
the insides of the plant, finely chopped, one teacupful of breadcrumbs and one tea- 
spoonful of finely-chopped parsley; mix thoroughly and cook for two minutes longer, 
or until the preparation commences to boil. Turn it into a basin when cold, stuff it 
into the eggplant skins, replace the lids, put the plant gently on a dish, cover with 
buttered paper and bake in a moderate oven for eighteen minutes. 

Stewed Endive with Cream Sauce. 

Take three large heads of endive and clean thoroughly; cut off all the outer 
green leaves and wash the endive in several waters. Drain and blanch them in boiling 
salted water for ten minutes. Remove, cool in cold water, then take them out and

Green Peas, Ancient Style. 

Take three quarts of young, tender green peas, shell them carefully, and keep 
them wrapped up in a wet cloth till wanted. Clean, drain, and tie up a lettuce head, 
put it in a saucepan with the peas, add a little salt, cover with a wineglassful of 
water, and add four ounces of butter. After cooking for fifteen minutes, remove the 
lettuce, and when ready to serve, thicken the peas with three tablespoonfuls of 
cream, diluted with the yolk of an egg, adding a very little white pepper, and a table- 
spoonful of powdered loaf sugar. Let all thicken together for five minutes, and serve 
at once in a vegetable dish. 

Boiled Green Peas. 

Shell one peck of fresh green peas, wash them in water, put them into two 
quarts of boiling water with one tablespoonful of salt and boil fast until they are 
tender (they should take about ten minutes), then drain, season with salt, pepper and 
butter, and serve at once. If the peas are to be served with lamb a small bunch of 
green mint should be boiled with them. Parsley and young onions are sometimes 
boiled with green peas when their flavor is desired, and frequently a little sugar is 
added to sweeten them. 

Green Peas, Bourgeoise. 

Select the required quantity of young peas, put them into a stewpan with butter, 
allowing eight ounces to every quart of peas; add also the washed heart of a large 
lettuce, a bunch of parsley, a few small onions and a little salt. Moisten with a little 
broth and cook slowly until tender. Stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs and one 
teaspoonful of sugar, but do not boil after the eggs are added. Turn the peas onto 
a hot dish, and serve. 

Buttered Green Peas. 

Put some fresh green peas into a saucepan with a lump of butter, a little salt and 
a small quantity of water, cover and boil over a quick fire until tender. Knead one 
ounce of butter with some flour, put it in with the peas, stir them till thickened, then 
put-in four ounces of butter broken in little pieces, one-half teaspoonful of sugar and 
a small quantity of grated nutmeg. Turn the peas out onto a hot dish, garnish with 
sippets of fried bread, and serve. 



Green Peas, English Style. 



Shell and wash two quarts or more of green peas, remove the small ones, put

one-fourth ounce of fresh butter. Dish them in a vegetable dish, place another half 
ounce of butter in the center, and serve. 

Green Peas, Peasant Style. 

Wash a few cabbages and long lettuces, a handful of parsley and three or four 
green onions, cut them into shreds and put them into a saucepan with three quarts of 
green peas and a piece of butter; cover the pan and let them cook over a very slow 
fire without any other moisture, stirring occasionally to prevent their burning. When 
well cooked season with pepper and salt, turn them onto a hot dish, and serve. 

Puree of Green Peas. 

Put some green peas in a saucepan with a very small quantity of water and boil 
them until tender, then pass the whole through a fine hair-sieve. Put the puree in a 
saucepan with a little broth and stir it over the fire until boiling. Move the saucepan 
to the side of the fire, put in one-half teaspoonful of sugar, a moderate-sized lump of 
butter, and salt to taste. Cut some slices of bread, shape them into small croutons 
and fry them in butter. When lightly browned drain the croutons, put them in a deep 
dish, and pour the puree over them. Serve it with a separate dish of boiled rice. 

Stewed Green Peas with Bacon.

hour; then drain off the water and let them drain in the saucepan for a few minutes, 
after which turn them into a vegetable dish, fold them in a napkin, and serve. 

Potato Borders. 

These are generally used to form walls for holding different kinds of thick stews, 
hashes, minces, etc. The potatoes should first be boiled and then mashed either 
with or without butter and beaten eggs. If a mould is used it should be well 
buttered and the potatoes worked up thoroughly into a well-seasoned paste, with two 
eggs to each pound of potatoes; then press the paste firmly into the moulds and 
level off the top with a knife, set in a quick oven for half an hour or only a few 
minutes, according to whether the potato border is desired to be browned or not. 
Then turn onto a dish. 

Broiled Potatoes.

ness. Take a fryingpan which will hold the cake nicely, place a lump of butter in it 
to melt, then put in the cake, covering it with a plate, and cook over a good fire. 
When one side of the cake is done turn it carefully over, adding a little butter, if 
necessary, and cook on the other side; drain the cake well and lay it on a fancy dish-

remove, dry them on a cloth, put them in a fryingpan with melted fat to a trifle more 
than half their height and allow them to fry until they are partly done and com- 
mence to float; then skim out the potatoes and set the pan over a fiercer fire, and 
when the fat becomes smoking hot, again place the potatoes in it and fry until the

Sourcrout. (Fr. Choucroute; Ger. Sauerkraut). 

This is a variety of pickled cabbage dear to many of our traveling classes. 
Sourcrout has been pronounced very wholesome by experienced chemists. It may 
be made and prepared for the table in several ways. The following are among the 
best methods of preparation: 

(i.) Shred fine some white-hearted cabbages, put them in a jar, and sprinkle 
over them one handful of salt, one-half tablespoonful of cream of tartar, and a little 



VEGETABLES. 479 

water. Put some of the big outside leaves of the cabbage on the top, place a 
cover on the jar with a weight on it, and keep it in a warm temperature. In a week 
or two the sourcrout will be ready for use. 

Boiled Sourcrout. 

To prepare the sourcrout for boiling soak it in plenty of cold water until it is only 
palatably salty, put it over the fire in a saucepan of boiling water, or in the same pot 
in which bacon, pickled pork, or smoked sausages are boiling, and boil until it is ten- 
der. To serve the sourcrout drain it, put it on a dish, lay the meat on it, and serve 
them together. When it is cooked without meat it is simply served as a vegetable. 
When cold it may be chopped and fried in butter, or heated in white sauce or some 
gravy. 

Sourcrout with Apples. 

Shred fine some white-hearted cabbages, peel about half the quantity of apples 
and slice them thin. Rub the inside of a saucepan over with butter. Put at the 
bottom a slice of fat bacon, then a layer of the cabbage, a small piece of butter, four 
or five slices of lemon, a little ground mace and pepper, two or three tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar, then the apples, some slices of ham and more cabbage in alternate layers. 
When the stewpan is full place a layer of veal fat on the top and bake all in a moder^ 
ate oven for three hours. Serve on a hot dish. 

Sourcrout with Goose, Roumanian. 

Draw and wash a fat goose and season the interior of it with pepper and salt and 
any other kind of seasoning desired. Cut one or two cabbages into very thin shreds, 
and mix eighteen or twenty peppercorns with them. Put it into a baking-dish and 
place the goose on the top. Bake it in a moderate oven, basting occasionally with 
butter. When cooked place the goose on a hot dish, garnish it with the sourcrout, 
and serve with a sauceboatful of good gravy. 

Sourcrout with Pork and Sausages. 

Wash well three pints of sourcrout in several waters, drain and put it into a sauce- 
pan with a large piece of well-washed salt pork, two carrots, three smoked sausages, 
two whole onions, one whole breakfast cupful of roast meat fat, half a dozen juniper 
berries, one wineglassful of white wine and one pint of white broth. Let it cook 
slowly for three hours; drain the sourcrout and dish it up with the pork on top; the 
pork may either be served in one piece or divided into five or six slices, arranging the 
sausages around.

this country, the chief of which are the summer and winter kinds; the former is 



480 VEGETABLES. 

known as the round-seeded or summer spinach, and the latter as the prickly or winter 
spinach. The leaves are fleshy and succulent, and when thoroughly washed by pass- 
ing through several lots of fresh water, they may be cooked or prepared according to 
the following recipes. The juice of the leaves is used to color confectionery. 

Blanch a peck of well-washed spinach and drain it ; put it into a saucepan with 
one-half breakfast cupful of veal stock, and cook for ten minutes. When ready to 
serve, add one ounce of butter, melt well together, and serve with croutons of fried 
bread.

kneaded with two tablespoonfuls of flour, two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and 
one-half pint of milk. Stir often and cook for ten minutes ; then serve, garnished 
with half a dozen sippets of bread fried in butter. 



Spinach Croustades. 



Cut some heart-shaped bread croustades, fry them until well browned, then scoop 
out the crumb from their middle. Prepare some spinach as for spinach with cream, 
and when ready fill the croustades with it. 



Minced Spinach. 



Boil the spinach in plenty of salted water. When cooked, drain off all the water, 
chop the spinach very fine and season well with salt and pepper. For each pint of 
minced spinach put one tablespoonful of butter and one-half tablespoonful of flour 
into a saucepan and stir it over the fire until smooth and cooked. Put the spinach in 
with the cooked flour before it has become brown, adding for each pint one-half tea- 
cupful of milk and stirring it for a few minutes longer. Put the spinach into a basin, 
then turn it out in shape onto a hot dish. Put a circle of hard-boiled eggs on the 
top of the spinach and another circle of sliced eggs at the bottom, and serve. 



Spinach with Cream. 



Pick and wash the spinach well, boiling it in plenty of salted water; when tender, 
drain and put it in cold water for a few minutes. Press all the moisture out of the 
spinach and put it into a saucepan with a little butter and stir over the fire until dry. 
Dredge a little flour over the spinach, pour in one-fourth pint of boiling cream and 
season with a little grated nutmeg, sugar and salt. Turn it onto a hot dish, garnish 
with croutons of fried bread, and serve.

Peel a large winter or summer squash, or a couple of small ones, cut them into 
pieces about one-inch square, place them over the fire in a saucepan of boiling salted 
water, and boil until tender. Meanwhile, for three pints of squash, mix together in a 
stewpan over the fire one tablespoonful each of flour and butter and stir them until 
they are brown; gradually add one pint of boiling water and a high seasoning of pep- 
per and salt, and when it boils, set it aside until the squash is done. After the 
squash is drained from the water in which it was boiled, put it into the hot brown 
sauce and serve it without delay; or simply mash the boiled squash through a colan- 
der, beat it together with salt, pepper and butter, and serve. 

Mashed Squash. 

Wash the squashes and cut them into small pieces without removing the skin 
and seeds. Place them in a saucepan of boiling water with a lump of salt and boil 
until soft, which will take in the neighborhood of half an hour. Then turn the squash 
into a cloth, mash it, and squeeze it until the moisture is extracted. Return the 
squash to the saucepan with one-half teacupful of cream for each pint, season it to 
taste with pepper and salt, and stir it over the fire until it is thoroughly hot. Then 
turn it onto a hot dish, and serve. 

Stewed Squash. 

Peel a squash, cut it into small pieces and boil it in salted water until tender. 
Drain, put it into a clean towel and wring out all the water; put it again into a sauce- 
pan over the fire with two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter and a seasoning of salt 
and pepper, stir until it is hot, and then serve. 

Succotash. 

Place six medium-sized freshly cooked and scraped ears of Indian corn (or a can 
of canned corn will do) in a saucepan with a pint of Lima beans, adding about one 
ounce of butter, a pinch of salt and a little pepper and grated nutmeg, also one-half 
pint of milk. Heat it thoroughly for five minutes, add two tablespoonfuls of hot 
bechamel sauce, stir all well together, and serve. 



Sweet Peppers Sauted. 



Place the sweet peppers in boiling water in order to facilitate the removal of the 
skin and divide each one in two, cutting away all the hard portions, and saute gradu- 
ally in oil while cooking; then season with salt, some finely-chopped shallot and 
parsley; dress on a vegetable dish, and serve.

Tomatoes, Andalusian Style. 



Boil together in a saucepan one pint of tomato sauce and three pints of con- 
somme. Add one-half tablespoonful of salt and one teaspoonful of pepper, then put 
in two teaspoonfuls of tapioca, stirring well all the time. Cook for fifteen minutes, 
add twelve or fourteen chicken quenelles, and then serve. 

Tomatoes and Eggs. 

Put half a dozen ripe tomatoes into a saucepan with a very little water to pre- 
vent their burning and boil them; rub them through a fine sieve and mix in a little 
chopped onion, salt and pepper to taste, and two or three eggs. Turn the mixture 
into a fryingpan with a small quantity of butter, fry until done and serve on a dish. 
Finely-chopped ham may be added if desired. 

Baked Tomatoes. 

Cut some ripe tomatoes in halves, put them in a buttered baking-dish, sprinkle 
with plenty of sifted breadcrumbs, pepper and salt to taste, stick small bits of butter 
over the top and bake them until the tops are slightly browned. 

Tomatoes, Bock Style. 

Wipe and peel eight fine, fresh, ripe tomatoes. Cut each one into six equal- 
sized pieces, and place them in a saucepan with two ounces of butter, season with one 
pinch of salt and one-half pinch of pepper, and one-third of a pinch of grated nut- 
meg. Cover the pan and place it on a hot stove to cook the contents for fifteen 
minutes or so. Remove from the fire, pour the tomatoes into a deep, hot vegetable 
dish, and send them to the table very hot. 

Broiled Tomatoes. 

Carefully remove the skin from some good sound tomatoes, and to facilitate this 
they should be placed for a short time in boiling water, cut them across in two, sea- 
soning with a little salt and pour some oil over. Next put them on a hinged double 
broiler and broil them over a slow fire, basting them at frequent intervals with oil. 
When done dress them on a hot dish. 

Deviled Tomatoes. 

Mash the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, mix with them one saltspoonful of 
salt, one teaspoonful each of powdered sugar and made mustard, and as much cay- 
enne pepper as will lay on a five-cent piece, and rub in three ounces of butter, warmed 
until it is very soft. When these are well mixed stir in by degrees three tablespoon- 



VEGETABLES. 483 

fuls of vinegar, put the mixture into a pan over the fire, and let it get almost boiling 
hot; remove it from the fire and stir in two well-beaten eggs, return it to the fire 
and stir it until it begins to thicken; then stand in hot water on the stove to keep 
warm. Take about one quart of firm ripe tomatoes, cut them into slices not quite 
one-half inch thick, broil them over a clear fire, place them on a hot chafing-dish, pour 
the hot sauce over them, and serve. 

Fried Tomatoes. 

Cut six or eight large tomatoes into thick slices, dip them in egg well beaten, 
with a seasoning of salt, pepper and sugar, and cover them with bread or cracker- 
crumbs. Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter in a fryingpan, cover the bottom of the 
pan with slices of tomatoes and fry them for about ten minutes, turning them so as 
to cook both sides equally. Place them on pieces of toast, spread on a dish, and serve. 



Tomatoes, Marseilles Style. 



Select six good-sized firm tomatoes, wipe and cut them into halves through the 
sides. Pour one-half gill of sweet oil into a fryingpan, let it heat well, lay in the toma- 
toes on the sides which were cut, and cook briskly for one minute. Butter well a tin 
baking-dish, lay the tomatoes in this on the uncooked sides, and season with one-half 
pinch each of pepper and salt. Make a stuffing with finely-chopped shallot, two cloves 
of crushed garlic, one teaspoonful of chopped chives, two hard-boiled eggs, one tea- 
spoonful of parsley, two finely-chopped anchovies, and one ounce of butter. Stir well 
together in a bowl and cover the tops of the tomatoes with the stuffing, dividing it 
equally. Dust with a little fresh breadcrumbs, drop three or four drops of warmed 
butter over each tomato, and bake in a very hot oven for eight minutes. 

Tomatoes on Toast. 

Cut the tomatoes in halves, sprinkle them over with salt and pepper, place them 
on a baking-dish, the cut side upwards, and bake in a hot oven. Cut as many rounds 
of bread as there are halves of tomatoes, toast them a nice golden-brown on both 
sides, and butter them while hot. When the tomatoes are cooked place a half on 
each round of toast. Spread a folded napkin on a hot dish, garnish it with fried 
parsley, and serve. 

Tomato Pilau. 

Put one and one-half pounds of ripe tomatoes into a mortar aud press them to 
extract their juice, which strain through a fine hair-sieve; then pour it into a saucepan 
with an equal quantity of broth. Peel and chop fine two onions, put them into a 
fryingpan with a lump of butter, and fry until well browned. Drain the onions, put 
them in with the tomato juice, add a pinch of salt, and place the saucepan over the 



484 VEGETABLES. 

fire. When the liquor boils put in one pound of well-washed rice, and allow it to sim- 
mer at the side of the fire until the moisture is absorbed. Heat four ounces of butter, 
stir it in with the rice; put the lid on the saucepan again, and let it stand on the stove 
for twenty minutes. Turn the pilau onto a hot dish, sprinkle over a little pepper, 
and serve while very hot. 

Stewed Tomatoes. 

Scald and peel the required quantity of tomatoes, cut them into halves or quar- 
ters, place them in a lined saucepan, and stew them for a quarter of an hour, when 
the juice will be partly boiled away. If desired the tomatoes may be thickened with 
a little cornstarch, moistened with cold water or with cracker or breadcrumbs. 
Turn the stew out onto a dish, sprinkle over with salt and pepper to taste, place 
a few lumps of butter on the top, let it melt, and then serve. A little sugar may also 
be sprinkled over if desired. 

Stewed Tomatoes (Sweet). 

Scald and peel a dozen or so of ripe tomatoes, place them in a baking-dish and 
cover with sugar; put the dish in a hot oven and bake the contents until the sugar 
has melted and dried down to a syrup. Take them out, and serve. 

Stuffed Tomatoes. 

Wipe four large tomatoes with a soft cloth, cut a small round off the top of each 
one with a sharp knife, and scoop out as much of the inside as can be removed without 
spilling the shape of the tomato. Mix with the scooped out center of the tomatoes 
about one-fourth pound of finely-minced ham, one teaspoonful of sugar, three small 
onions, chopping the latter very fine, a dessertspoonful of vinegar, a sprig of thyme 
and a seasoning of salt, cayenne and pepper. Put all these together into a small 
fryingpan over the fire, and stir the mixture until the liquid is somewhat reduced 
about ten or fifteen minutes will be long enough. Then pass it through a fine sieve, 
and fill the emptied tomatoes with it. Bake them for a short time in a hot oven. 
Lay a small piece of butter on top of the mixture in each tomato when they are 
placed in the oven. Serve them very hot on the dish in which they were baked. 

Tomatoes with Sago. 

Boil one pint of tomatoes and three pints of consomme in a saucepan for ten 
minutes, seasoning with one-half pinch each of salt and pepper ; add two tablespoon- 
fuls of sago, cook again for fifteen minutes, stirring gently, and serve. 

Tomatoes with Spaghetti. 

Pour into a saucepan one pint each of tomato sauce and white broth, and season 
with one teaspoonful each of salt and pepper. Let it boil well for ten minutes, then 



VEGETABLES. 485 

throw in one-half pint of cooked spaghetti, cut about three-fourths of an inch in 
length ; cook again for five minutes, tossing them well meanwhile, and serve very hot. 

Glazed Turnips. 

Peel some turnips and cut them into the shapes of small pears ; put them in a 
saucepan with some water and a small quantity of salt, and boil them for ten 
minutes. Turn them on a sieve and leave them until thoroughly drained. Melt 
about one ounce of butter in a saucepan, put in the turnips, strew in plenty of 
powdered sugar, and toss them about over the fire until they begin to color. Moisten 
them with a small quantity of broth, season with salt, pepper, and a little ground cin- 
namon, and boil them gently until tender. When cooked pile the turnips on a hot 
dish, pour the sauce over them, and serve. 

Turnips in Batter. 

Put one-fourth pound of butter into a stewpan and place it over the fire; when it 
has melted stir in one tablespoonful of flour and one pint of milk. Season with salt, 
pepper and a small quantity of sugar, and continue stirring it over the fire until it 
thickens; then put in one breakfast cupful of boiled turnips, continue stirring the 
mixture over the fire, and boil it for ten minutes. Cut two slices of bread, trim the 
crusts and toast them nicely. Butter the toast, cut each piece into quarters, and 
place them on a hot dish; pour the turnip mixture over them, and serve immediately. 

Mashed Turnips. 

Peel the turnips, wash them, cut them into thin slices, put them in a steamer 
over a saucepan of boiling water and steam them for about an hour, or until they are 
quite tender; then mash them with a small quantity of milk, seasoning with salt and 
pepper. 

Stewed Turnips with Sugar. 

Procure a number of young turnips as nearly of one size as possible, put them in 
a saucepan with a lump of butter and fry them until they are well browned. Sprinkle 
some powdered sugar over them, season with a small quantity of salt, pour in one 
teacupful of stock more or less according to the quantity of the turnips, place the 
cover on the saucepan, and let them simmer gently until they are tender. When 
cooked turn the turnips onto a hot dish, and serve. 

Stuffed Turnips. 

Choose turnips all of one size, peel them, cut off the tops and scoop out their 
insides. Chop fine two onions and enough mutton to fill the turnips, stir in with it two 
tablespobnfuls of well-washed rice, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley and a small 
quantity each of salt and pepper. Mix all these items together well. Stuff the 



486 VEGETABLES. 

turnips with the mixture, replace their tops, thus forming lids, place them in a sauce- 
pan, moisten to their height with broth, put in a small lump of salt and stew them 
gently till tender. Pour in one wineglassful of malt vinegar and one tablespoonful 
of powdered sugar, and finish cooking them. Arrange the turnips tastefully in a 
group in the center of a hot dish, pour the remainder of their cooking stock around 
them, and serve. 

Turnips with Cream. 

. Procure some nice tender turnips and boil then in salted water; when done, turn 
them onto a sieve and allow them to drain well. Put one ounce of butter into a 
stewpan with one-half tablespoonful of flour and mix thoroughly over the fire with 
one-half teacupful of cream and one-half teacupful of milk. Season to taste with 
salt, pepper and a small quantity of grated nutmeg, put in the turnips and then 
simmer gently at the side of the fire for fifteen minutes. Put them on a hot dish, 
pour their sauce over, and serve. 

Turnip Tops. 

The young shoots of the field turnip form a very excellent vegetable in 
early spring when freshly gathered and used as greens. They have a very pleasant 
bitter flavor, and are a very good substitute for spinach. 

Boiled Turnip Tops. 

Wash thoroughly and pick over a quantity of turnip tops and drain them well. 
Plunge them in a good supply of fast-boiling water with a small quantity of salt in it 
and let them boil for twenty or twenty-five minutes. Drain them well and serve 
either plain or chopped fine, mixed with salt, pepper and a small quantity of butter. 

Mashed Turnip Tops. 

Thoroughly wash and pick over a quantity of turnip tops, place them in a 
saucepan of boiling water and boil them until they are tender. Turn the greens onto 
a fine sieve, press them well to extract all the water, and when almost dry rub 
them through the sieve. Put one tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan together 
with one tablespoonful of flour and stir them over the fire until well mixed; then 
throw in the turnip tops, moisten with a very little clear gravy and season to taste 
with pepper and salt Stir the puree over the fire until very hot, then turn it onto 
a dish, garnish it with sippets of toast, and serve. 

Truffles. 

The kind of truffles which cooks have mostly to deal with are known as the 
green and the black; other kinds, such as the white, lack flavor and are not consid- 
ered as of much culinary value. The red truffle is supposed to be black before it is 



VEGETABLES. 487 

ripe, but some authorities consider it to be a separate species. In Africa truffles, 
called Terfezia, are very abundant and find their way into this country as a substi- 
tute for French truffles. They are not nearly so strong m flavor. 

Baked Truffles. 

Wash well and scrub a pound or so of truffles, w r ap each one in a piece of but- 
tered paper, put them in the oven or under hot ashes, and bake them for an hour. 
When done take them out, and they are then ready for use. 

(2.) Cut some large, fresh truffles into slices and place them on a dish that will 
stand the heat of the oven and can be served at table; dust them over with salt and 
pepper, strew over them moderate quantities of finely-minced parsley and shallot, 
baste them with a little olive oil, put another dish on the top, and put them in the 
oven. When the truffles are cooked squeeze the juice of a small lemon over them, 
and serve them in the same dish. 

Boiled Truffles. 

Peel and wash a dozen or more of large truffles, place them in a saucepan just 
large enough to hold them, add three or four cloves, a small piece of beaten mace, 
salt to suit the taste, and pour over sufficient white wine and water, in equal quanti- 
ties, to cover. Set the saucepan over the fire, cover it over and cook gently for one 
hour. Take out the truffles when done, drain them, place them on a napkin spread 
on a dish, and serve. 

Broiled Truffles. 

Wash well and peel four or five truffles, cover them over with slices of bacon, 
dust over pepper and salt to taste, and wrap them round with four or five thicknesses 
of paper dipped in cold water, push them into hot cinders or ashes, and broil them 
for fifteen minutes or so. Remove them when done, take off two thicknesses or the 
whole of the paper, place them on a dish, and serve. 

Truffles Cooked in Champagne. 

Wash well and clean one-half pound of truffles, place in a saucepan, sprinkle 
over salt and pepper to taste, as well as a small quantity of grated nutmeg, moisten 
with champagne, and a little blonde veau or veal stock, and boil until tender. Re- 
move the truffles when done, and turn them on a dish ; strain the liquor into another 
saucepan, reduce it to one-half its quantity, pour it over the truffles, and serve. 

Truffles in Cases. 

Select a quantity of truffles, all about of the same size, peel them and cook them 
in white wine and stock, using very little liquid. Truffles should never be cooked 



488 VEGETABLES. 

too long as they lose their flavor when overdone. When done leave them until cool, 
and then drain them. Make a pyramid shape out of cardboard or thin wood, fix it 
securely on fried bread support and brush it over with melted glaze ; have in readi- 
ness some small paper cases of the same size, one for each truffle. Roll the truffles 
in melted glaze, and place one in each case. Brush the bottoms of the cases over 
with melted glaze, and stick one in each pyramid, the largest ones at the base and 
the smaller ones at the top. Stick three transparent attelette skewers, garnished with 
truffles, on the top of the pyramid. This piece, being directly dished on the stand, 
is generally served at ball buffets, where each guest may help himself. 

Truffles in Croustades. 

Wash and peel six or eight truffles, chop them up small, put them into a sauce- 
pan with a little butter, and salt and pepper to taste, warm them over with a quick 
fire, and pour in four tablespoonfuls each of Madeira wine and melted glaze. Remove 
the saucepan from the fire when the liquor is reduced to half its original quantity, add 
a lump of butter, stir it in well, and keep the preparation warm, Cut some slices of 
bread about two-thirds of an inch thick, and cut these into the shapes of hearts, or 
any other desired shapes, mark them on one surface with the point of a knife, place 
them in a fryingpan with butter and fry them. Open them where they were marked, 
remove the insides, fill them with the truffle mixture, and serve on a napkin spread 
over a dish. 



Truffles, Italian Style. 



Scrub thoroughly in water eight or ten truffles, peel them, cut them up into thin 
slices, place them in a baking-tin, sprinkle over them one tablespoonful of finely- 
chopped parsley, pepper to taste, and a small quantity of powdered mace. Pour 
over them four tablespoonfuls of olive oil, place them in a fairly hot oven, and bake 
them for forty-five or fifty minutes. When cooked, place the truffles on a hot dish, 
squeeze the juice of half a lemon over them, and serve. 

Stewed Truffles on Crust. 

Cut some slices of bread about three-fourths of an inch in thickness, and shape 
the pieces like half-hearts, making them round on one end and pointed on the other, 
with the point of a knife, cutting an incision on one side only of each piece of bread. 
Fry them in butter until of a light golden color, then drain and hollow them out, 
but keep them warm. Cut about one-half pound of raw green truffles into small 
pieces, place them in a stewpan with a lump of butter, season them with salt and 
pepper, and fry them over a brisk fire. Pour over the truffles one teacupful of melted 
glaze, and one teacupful of Madeira wine, and boil them gently until the liquor has 
been reduced to half its original quantity. Remove the truffles from the fire, 



VEGETABLES. 489 

thicken their cooking liquor with a small quantity of sauce and two or three ounces 
of butter, and stir it for a few minutes at the side of the fire; then fill the crusts with 
it. Arrange them on a folded napkin laid on a dish, and serve them while hot. 

Stuffed Truffles. 

Wash thoroughly in warm water a dozen large truffles, place them in a sauce- 
pan with sufficient white wine to cover them, and cook. Remove, drain, cut them 
with a cutter, scoop out the insides, fill them with cooked forcemeat, place them in 
the oven, warm them up, and serve on a napkin spread over a warm dish. 

Timbale of Truffles. 

Peel and wash a pound or two of truffles, cut them up into slices about one- 
fourth of an inch in thickness, put them into a sautepan with a little warmed butter, 
season them with salt and grated nutmeg, and toss them over the fire until they are 
done taking care not to break them. Meanwhile rub one ounce of butter into one- 
fourth pound of flour, add a small quantity of sugar and form the whole into a 
rather stiff paste by adding the yolks of three or four eggs. Roll it out very thin on 
a floured board and cut it into various shapes. Butter a plain timbale-mould well, 
pack it in ice, decorate it with the shapes of paste and allow them to set. Prepare 
a puff paste with one pound of flour and twelve ounces of butter, roll it out thin 
also and line the mould with it. It should be seven turns puff paste. Fill the mould 
with the slices of cooked truffles, cover it with more of the puff paste, make a slight 
hole in the center, place the mould on a baking-sheet in the oven, and bake. When 
done, turn the timbale out of the mould, make a slight hole in the top, pour in some 
warmed half-glaze, cover over the whole with a slice of cooked truffle, and serve hot. 

Macedoine of Vegetables. 

Cut a small, raw carrot with a vegetable scoop, put the pieces into boiling salted 
water and cook for fifteen minutes; repeat the same with a small raw turnip, cooking 
each vegetable separately. Drain and place them in a saucepan with one gill of 
cooked peas the same quantity of cooked string beans, about one-half inch in length, 
two tablespoonfuls of cooked flagelots and a small piece of cauliflower. Moisten 
with one-half pint of hot bechamel sauce and season with one-half pinch each of 
salt and pepper and a little grated nutmeg. Allow it to simmer gently for ten min- 
utes, and use as required. 

Vegetable Puree. 

Prepare any kind of vegetables, such as potatoes, leeks, carrots, onions, turnips, 
etc., place them all together in a stewpan with a bunch of sweet herbs, stock to cover 
them, and salt, pepper and spices to taste, and boil them until they are quite tender;

VEGETABLES. 



then mash them through a fine hair-sieve. Put two ounces of butter and a tablespoon- 
ful of flour in a stewpan, stir it over the fire and then mix in the puree gradually. 
Stir it again over the fire for a few minutes, then move it to the side and beat in the 
yolks of two eggs that have been beaten up with a small quantity of milk, and 
strained. Turn the puree onto a hot dish, garnish it with sippets of toast or croutons 
of bread that have been fried brown in butter, and serve. 

German Mode of Cooking Watercress. 

Wash a quantity of watercress and chop it slightly; put two ounces of butter in 
a stewpan with two tablespoonfuls of flour and stir over the fire until well-browned, 
then pour in gradually one-half pint of water and keep on stirring over the fire until 
boiling. Season the sauce with salt, pepper, a little grated nutmeg and sufficient 
lemon juice or vinegar to give it an agreeable acidity. Put in the watercress, boil up, 
then turn it into a dish, and serve as a vegetable. 

Stewed Watercress. 

Trim off the coarse ends of the stems and thoroughly wash the watercress, then 
put it into a saucepan of boiling water with salt and boil it. When cooked, turn the 
watercress into a colander and press out as much of the water as possible; put about 
two ounces of butter in a stewpan to melt, then put in the cress and sprinkle over it a 
little flour. Stir the cress over the fire for ten minutes, and pour in one-half pint of 
broth, season it with a small quantity of grated nutmeg, salt and pepper and boil for 
ten minutes longer, stirring all the time. Turn the watercress onto a hot dish, gar- 
nish with croutons of fried bread and halves of hard-boiled eggs, and serve. 



STOCKS. 

Fumet of Game. 

Take one carrot and half an onion; peel and cut them into slices and put them 
with half a sprig of thyme, one bay leaf, a little chopped, raw, lean ham and the car- 
cass of any kind of raw game in a covered saucepan. Let brown, add one wine- 
glassful of Madeira and boil; then moisten with a quart of white broth or consomme 
and add a pinch of salt and twelve whole peppers. Cook well for forty-five minutes, 
then pass through a broth napkin and preserve in a jar. 

Glaze for Cold Fowl. 

Put into a saucepan five parts of veloute sauce to one of chicken stock, reduce 
to a glaze, thicken with the yolk of egg, pass through a sieve, when it is ready for use. 

Glaze for Cold Hams and Tongues. 

Put half a shin of beef in a saucepan with one gallon of water and boil for twelve 
hours. Boil a knuckle of veal in water until all the goodness is extracted; strain the 
liquors from the beef and veal, mix them together, seasoning with moderate quanti- 
ties of salt, pepper and cloves, and boil until reduced to one pint. Strain the glaze 
through a fine hair-sieve and pour it into the jar. When cold tie it over and keep in 
a dry place. The glaze will keep good for ten or twelve months. A small portion 
of it should be warmed for use and brushed over the article with a feather. 

Glaze for Cold Partridges or Woodcocks. 

Put into a saucepan five parts of Spanish sauce with one part of game stock, 
reduce, pass it through a sieve and stir it into a little brown meat jelly. It will remain 
good for a long time if kept in a jar in a cool place. 

Glaze for Turkeys. 

Skim off the fat from some meat jelly, put it in a stewpan and stir over a sharp 
fire until it is of the consistency of thick cream. Skim it and strain it into jars in 
which it should be kept until needed for use. It should be made hot before using, 
and brushed over the bird with a paste brush.

STOCKS. 



Half-Glaze (Demi-Glaze). 

Put one pint of veal broth, one pint of Spanish sauce and three ounces of meat- 
glaze in a saucepan and stir it over the fire. Boil for five minutes, strain through a 
hair-sieve, pour into jars, cover with paper and keep until wanted for use. 

Yellow Glaze for Cakes. 

Beat up the white of an egg with four ounces of powdered white sugar, add to it 
by degrees the strained juice of half a lemon and beat it well, for the more it is beaten 
the whiter it will be. When it is white enough, add to it a small quantity of strained 
infusion of saffron. Grate the yellow rind of a lemon on lumps of sugar, or if the 
flavor of lemon peel is desired, the rinds of two lemons may be used. Scrape off the 
yellow sugar, pound and beat it in, being careful not to put too much, or the glaze 
will be bitter. 

Jelly for Cold Fish. 

Take a small skate, clean it well, place it over the fire in a fish-kettle with a calf's 
foot, a slice of bacon, an onion, a piece of horse-radish, three or four blades of mace, 
a piece of lemon peel, and a sprinkling of white pepper. Pour over three quarts of 
water and allow it to simmer until it is a jelly. Strain, let it stand until cold, and 
take off the fat; take the jelly up without the sediment, place it over the fire with a 
piece of lemon, the whites of four eggs and a glass of sherry. Allow it to boil for a 
few minutes without stirring, then place it in a warm spot, and let it stand for half an 
hour. Strain through a sieve with a cloth in it, and cover the cold fish with it. 



Savory Jelly as Mayonnaise. 



Prepare one quart of aspic jelly, place it in a stewpan with one tablespoonful of 
vinegar, one tablespoonful of salad oil, and one pinch of mignonette pepper; whisk 
the jelly for ten minutes, then place the pan on the ice, and continue whipping until 
the mayonnaise is set and firm; remove, melt, then whip it over the ice till it sets 
again. Warm it once more, and strain through a jelly bag. It is then ready for use. 
Whipping it over the ice twice, it is generally conceded, makes it whiter and 
smoother. 

Marinade. 

This is a French culinary term which signifies a brine, in which fish, flesh, or 
fowl may be soaked for a while before cooking them. By doing this a considerable 
addition is made to the flavor of the article marinaded. Marinades may be either 
cooked or raw, the former being used either hot or cold. Stew together a finely-sliced 
onion and four parsley roots, adding one pint of vinegar and four quarts of fresh 
water ; also a quarter of a bunch of thyme, six bay leaves, twenty-four whole peppers,

and twelve cloves. Cook these for thirty minutes on a brisk fire, then put them in a 
stone jar and keep them in a cool place for use. 

Marinade for Beef. 

Pour into a stewpan equal quantites of water and vinegar, the quantity depend- 
ing upon the size of the sirloin to be marinaded, add a few sliced onions and carrots, 
salt, peppercorns, and a clove of garlic. Place the pan on the fire, boil until all the 
goodness is extracted from the vegetables, then strain and let it get cold. The meat 
should be left for fully twenty-four hours to soak. 

Marinade for Fish. 

Chop fine two carrots, three onions, six shallots, and a clove of garlic ; put 
them into a saucepan, add a bunch each of sweet herbs and parsley, and a little butter, 
then let cook slowly over the fire for a few minutes ; pour in two pints of cider or any 
sweet wine, though the former is preferable, and boil for two or three minutes, next 
add two dozen peppercorns and an equal quantity of allspice, three cloves and a 
handful of salt. Place the saucepan at the side of the fire and simmer gently for an 
hour and a half ; strain, and the marinade is ready for use. It is generally employed 
for the purpose of boilng fish, to which it gives a very pleasant flavor. It will last 
for a long time, and can be used on several occasions, taking care to strain it after the 
fish has been boiled and removed. 

Marinade for Game. 

Pour into a saucepan the contents of one bottle of wine (white), one pint of 
vinegar, one quart of water, one handful of peppercorns, four bay leaves, a few lumps 
of sugar, a slice or two of carrot and onion, and a root of parsley; boil up well, turn 
the marinade into an earthern pan, and it is ready for use. All large game should be 
marinaded for at least two days before cooking, and should be turned in it once or 
twice each day. 

Mirepoix. 

This is the name given to a flavoring used for savory stew. It is made as follows: 

Take two carrots, two onions, two bay leaves, two shallots and a clove of garlic, 

and mince them together with one-half pound of fat bacon and raw ham. Toss these 

in a stewpan with two ounces of butter and salt to season. Stew with one-half pint 

of red or white wine, and add to stock or sauce as required. 

Stock. 

This is a liquid or jelly containing the juices and soluble parts of meat and cer- 
tain vegetables extracted by cooking, for the purpose of making soups, gravies or

STOCKS. 



sauces. Such a broad definition leaves much to the discretion of the cook, and it is 
not, therefore, surprising that stock is as varied as the purposes for which it is used, 
and even more so, as every cook has his or her own fancy in the preparation of stock, 
and many are compelled to use whatever may be at hand. Bones and trimmings of meat 
make good stock, and as these need to be cooked for a long time they should be set 
near the fire after once boiling up, in a stockpot, the best of which are fitted with a 
tap or faucet so that any quantity can be drawn off at a time free from the fat which 
naturally floats on top. When the stock is cold a cake of fat will be found on the 
top, which can be removed by passing a knife around between it and the sides of the 
pot. It can then be lifted off and carefully cleared of the jelly and the jelly wiped 
over with a cloth wrung out in hot water. If the stock be required before it has had 
time to cool, and the stockpot has no tap, then most of the fat can be removed by 
straining the stock several times through a napkin dipped repeatedly in cold water. 
In the following recipes full directions will be found. 



Crayfish Stock. 



Boil three dozen crayfish, put the meat from the tails together with the bodies 
into a mortar and pound thoroughly with one dozen blanched sweet almonds. Put 
four ounces each of ham and veal into a saucepan with a few parsnips, sliced onions 
and carrots, cook for a few minutes on the side of the fire, then add a small quantity 
of melted bacon fat and one teaspoonful of flour, stir the latter in thoroughly and 
pour in the amount of stock required. Season with mushrooms, truffles, chives, 
cloves, basil, salt, pepper and parsley, and add two or three small breadcrusts. 
Simmer slowly until the veal is done, take it out, add the mashed crayfish and rub 
the whole through a fine sieve. It is then ready for use. This stock may be used 
for moistening pies, patties, etc., or for cooking such vegetables as cauliflowers, 
cardoons, etc., or it may simply be served with boiled rice. 

Dark Stock. 

Secure a piece from the shin or lower part of a round of beef, with an equal 
weight of bones, and place the latter in a stockpot. Wipe the meat over with a cloth 
dipped in cold water and cut it into nice-sized pieces. Peel the required quantity of 
onions and fry them in butter until they are darkly browned; then put in the pieces 
of meat and brown them also. Put the meat in the stockpot with the bones, add any 
other trimmings of meat that may be convenient, fill the pot with cold water and 
place it over the fire. When the liquor boils take the stockpot off the fire, remove 
the scum, put in the browned onions with some prepared carrots, turnips, celery, a 
bunch of sweet herbs and a flavoring of allspice, ground pepper, celery seed, cloves 
and salt; add also one tablespoonful of caramel. Keep the stock simmering slowly 
at the edge of the fire until the meat is in shreds, -then strain it through a hair-sieve

into a basin. It should never be allowed to remain in an iron kettle after it is made. 
Set the basin in a cool place, keeping it uncovered. Leave the fat which forms at 
the top of the stock in a thick cake until the stock is needed, as it excludes the air 
and thus assists in keeping the stock. It will be preserved at least a week longer in 
winter if no vegetables are used. A little fresh charcoal tied in a muslin bag and 
boiled in the stock is said to restore it when only slightly changed. 

First Stock. 

Procure a piece of beef, the breast part will answer, put it into the stockpot with 
some trimmings of beef, pour in a sufficient quantity of cold water, allowing about 
two pints to the pound of beef, and set it over the fire. Keep it well skimmed, 
removing the scum as soon as it rises to the top, and pouring in occasionally a little 
cold water to force the scum to the surface. When quite clear put in a few prepared 
vegetables, such as turnips, carrots, onions stuck with cloves, leeks and celery; add 
one or two tablespoonfuls of salt, move the stockpot to the. edge of the fire and allow 
the contents to simmer for five or six hours. Skim off all the fat and strain the broth 
through a fine hair-sieve into a basin. When using the broth pour it out carefully, so 
as to avoid disturbing the sediment at the bottom. This broth is used for making 
any other kind of broth. 

Clear French Stock. 

Cut up six or seven pounds of beef, place it in a stockpot with some crushed 
bones and a few peeled turnips, carrots, parsnips and one broiled onion, a bunch of 
laurel leaf and parsley, two or three cloves, a small lump of sugar, and pepper and 
salt to taste. Pour in three quarts of water, place the stockpot over the fire until the 
liquor boils; then skim it well, move it to the side and let it simmer for six or seven 
hours. At the end of that time skim the stock again, then strain it into a basin. 
When cold remove all the fat from the top and it is ready for use. 

Game Stock. 

Put the carcasses of two birds and one pint of mirepoix into a saucepan, cover 
with water, add a pinch of salt, cook for twenty minutes, and it is ready for use. 

General Stock. 

i 

Take four pounds of any fresh trimmings of lean meat and bones, cut the meat 
from the bones and break them; put them in a stockpot together with the meat, add 
a small quantity of salt and five quarts of water. Place the stockpot over the fire and 
let the contents boil. Skim the stock and then add some scraped and washed carrot, 
a peeled onion or two and one or two trimmed and washed leeks; cover the pot

closely and let the contents boil gently for at least five hours. Strain the stock, pour 
it into a bowl and allow it to stand in a cold place till it is required for use. 

Gravy Stock. 

Put one pound of lean minced beef into a flat stewpan, place the cover on and 
toss the pan over the fire until the meat is browned. Pour over two breakfast cupfuls 
of hot water and let this boil until half the liquor has evaporated ; then pour in an- 
other half pint of water and add a thick slice of lean ham, one onion, a bunch of 
sweet herbs, a little ground mace, and salt to taste. Let this boil until the liquor is 
again reduced to less than half a pint, then pass the liquor through a strainer or 
squeeze it in a broth napkin, and when all the liquor possible is squeezed out, set it 
away to cool. There should not be any fat, but if there should happen to be any, it 
will collect and harden at the top. This gravy stock is useful at all times for making 
gravy at a minute's notice. 

Mixed Stock. 

Put the trimmings and bones of any kind of meat into a stockpot with one quart 
of water with every two pounds of meat and bones, and place it over the fire until the 
contents commence to boil. Skim the stock, move it to the side, and let it simmer 
very slowly for six or seven hours. At the end of that time put into the stockpot a 
bunch of sweet herbs, a moderate sized onion with half a dozen cloves stuck in it, 
and one teaspoonful of peppercorns. Keep the stock simmering for two hours longer, 
removing the scum occasionally ; then strain it through a fine hair-sieve into a large 
bowl, and set away in a cool place. On the next morning skim off the fat. 

Second Stock. 

This is made with the bones, meat, vegetables, etc. that have been previously 
boiled in the first stock. After the liquor has been drained off them, pour in about 
three quarts of water, and let it simmer for four or five hours. Afterward strain it 
off into a basin, and keep it in a larder for making sauces, purees, etc., or it may 
have another quart of water added to it, and be boiled until reduced to one pint. 
Then strain it off into a basin. When cold it will be very stiff, and can be used for 
glaze. 

Veal Stock or Veal Blond. 

Melt a small lump of butter in a stewpan, then put in four sliced onions, four 
pounds of leg of veal, two pounds of gravy beef, and two old fowls from which the 
flesh has been cut. Pour in one pint of stock, stand the stewpan over the fire, and 
boil the mixture down to a glaze, then pour in five quarts of stock, and put in a heap- 
ing tablespoonful of salt. When boiling, skim the stock, and add in some carrots 



STOCKS. 497 

and leeks, and let it simmer gently for four hours by the side of the fire. Strain the 
stock through a broth napkin, leave it until cool, then skim off all the fat. Trim the 
fat and chop the flesh of the fowls fine, place it in a mortar and pound it to a pulp ; 
then put it into a large stewpan, mix in first a small quantity of veal stock, and then 
add the rest. Stand the stewpan over the fire, stir the contents till boiling, then 
move it to the side, and let it simmer gently for ten minutes. If quite clear at the 
end of that time, strain the stock through a broth napkin, to be kept until required. 



Butters, Hot and Cold. 

Anchovy Butter. 

This is very useful and can be used to spread on slips of toast as a relish, or 
may be employed in making anchovy sauce for fish, or be served in pats garnished 
with parsley. Clean bone and beat in a mortar to a paste one part of anchovies to 
two parts of fresh butter and add four ounces more butter. Pass through a sieve. 
Some cooks add spices and other finely-chopped parsley that has been scalded. 
Cayenne pepper and nutmeg may also be added to taste. 

Black or Brown Butter. 

Place in a stewpan over the fire about half a pound of butter, leaving it there 
until it browns and then cool. In another pan put a teacupful of vinegar and a 
little pepper and boil until reduced one-third. When the butter is quite cold put in 
the pepper and vinegar and again warm it over the fire, stirring it well, but do not allow 
it to boil; when thoroughly mixed together, pour off into pots. 

Crayfish Butter. 

Take the shells and small claws of some crayfish, place them in a mortar with 
a large piece of butter and pound until they become a paste. Put this into a stew- 
pan and the stewpan into a bain-marie. When the mixture is quite hot pass it 
through a tammy into a basin of cold water and let the butter rise to the top; it is 
then ready for use. A second method is to pick the meat from the tails of a dozen 
crayfish, dry the shells and pound them all together in a mortar, adding one ounce 
of good butter. Put all into a saucepan on a moderate fire, stirring until it clarifies, 
then strain it through a napkin, letting it fall into cold water. When congealed, take 
it out and place in a warm basin, stirring until it takes the color. 

Creamed Butter. 

This is better adapted for the making of cakes and some kinds of pastry. The 
requisite amount is poured into a basin and held before the fire until thoroughly 
melted and then beaten with the hand. 



Drawn Butter. 

Dissolve over a slow fire a quarter of a pound of butter, sprinkling in about a 
tablespoonful of flour; afterward add half a pint of boiling water and a pinch of salt. 

498 



BUTTERS, HOT AND COLD. 499 

Boil for a few minutes, stirring well, and then put in a teaspoonful of cold water. If 
intended for a pudding sauce put in a glass of white wine and half a grated nutmeg, 
stirring thoroughly. 

Garlic Butter Sauce. 

Peel and boil a couple of garlics as for "Garlic Flavoring for Gravies," drain, 
pound them to a paste in a mortar together with one ounce of butter, one saltspoon- 
ful of salt and half a saltspoonful of pepper; rub the mass through a fine hair-sieve, 
mix with it one breakfast cupful of butter warmed to melting and the strained juice 
of a lemon. It is then ready for use. 

Horseradish Butter. 

This is made by pounding grated horseradish and butter and adding salt to taste. 
The quantity of horseradish depends upon how strong the taste is required. 

Lobster Butter. 

Take the head and spawn of some hen lobsters, put them in a mortar and pound; 
add an equal quantity of fresh butter, and pound both together, being sure that they 
are thoroughly mixed. Pass this through a fine hair sieve, and the butter is then 
ready for use. It is very nice for garnishing or for making sandwiches. 

Maitre d'Hotel Butter. 

Put a quarter of a pound of butter, two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, a little 
salt and pepper, together with the juice of two lemons in a basin, and mix them well 
together, keeping in a cool place. 

Olive and Anchovy Butter. 

Stone some French olives, wash and chop them. Skin and bone an equal quan- 
tity of anchovies, chop them also, and mix them with the olives. Pour the mixture 
into a mortar with half its bulk of fresh butter and pound all together until perfectly 
smooth. Pass the mixture through a fine hair-sieve and shape it into small balls. 
Keep them on a dish which is placed over ice until they are ready to serve. This 
butter is very nice served with toast. 

Ravigote Butter. 

Place in a mortar one sprig of parsley, and tarragon, a -very small quantity of 
chives and a like amount of chervil, one small peeled shallot, half a teaspoonful of 
anchovy essence, an ounce of good butter, and a half drop of spinach green, then pound 
them well together. After this, rub them through a fine sieve, and keep in a cool 
place. 



5 oo BUTTERS, HOT AND COLD. 

Sardine Butter. 

Remove the skins and bones from seven or eight sardines, put the fish in a mor- 
tar and pound it until smooth. Boil two large handfuls of parsley until tender, then 
squeeze it as dry as possible, remove all the stalks or stems, and chop it. Put the 
parsley in the mortar with the sardines and four ounces of butter and pound again. 
When well incorporated mould the butter into shapes and keep it on ice until the 
time of serving. The above is excellent spread on hot toast. 

Shrimp Butter. 

Pick and shell one pound of shrimps, place them in a mortar to pound, add one- 
half pound of butter, and when well mixed pass the whole through a fine sieve. The 
butter is then ready for use. 

Tarragon Butter. 

Mince some tarragon leaves, put one tablespoonful of them into a mortar, pound 
well and work in one-fourth pound of butter, a squeeze of lemon juice, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Rub the preparation through a fine hair-sieve and it is then ready 
for use, and should be served with soles and mackerel. 

Thickened Butter. 

Place in a saucepan the yolks of a couple of eggs and break them gently with a 
spoon, adding slowly four ounces of butter melted but not browned, and set the pan 
over a slow fire, stirring well until of the required consistence. 



Gravies. 

Garlic Flavoring for Gravies. 

Peel a few cloves of garlic, plunge them into a saucepan of boiling water, let 
them remain for five minutes, take out and put them in another pan containing boil- 
ing water, and boil for five minutes longer. Continue in this way until the cloves of 
garlic are quite tender; add a pinch of salt to the liquor, mix it in with gravy in 
equal proportions and it is ready for use. 

Garlic Flavoring for a Salad (Chapon). 

Cut from a loaf of bread a thin crust two inches long by one inch wide and 
sprinkle over a little salt. Rub a peeled clove of garlic ovei both sides of the crust, 
lay it at the bottom of the salad bowl, place the salad over and stir it about. 

Chicken Gravy. 

Put into a stockpot the bones and trimmings of a fowl or chicken with a small 
quantity of stock and boil them; add flour and butter (previously browned to a light 
brown) to thicken it and then place the pot at the side of the stove and let it simmer. 
Stir well, and after the gravy has simmered for some time, skim and strain it, and it 
is then ready for use. 

Colorings for Gravies. 

(1) Put a little burnt Spanish onion into a basin, pour some boiling water over 
it, and work it with a spoon. Put it into the gravy and boil up together. This gives 
to the gravy a decided flavor. 

(2) Put an old iron spoon into the fire and make it hot. A little moist sugar 
dropped into the spoon gives a caramel that only requires to be mixed in the gravy 
to give the latter any tinge of brown desired. 

(3) Baked raspings from bread will thicken and brown all kinds of gravies, 
but will not color to give satisfaction without thickening. 

(4) A little flour baked until quite brown in a tin dish will color the gravy and 
may be always kept on hand ready for use, but is as objectionable as bread raspings 
for general use. 

Fish Gravy. 

Put into a saucepan two pounds of any kind of fish flesh cut into pieces with half 
a gallon of water, and add a blade of mace, three cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs and 

501

GRAVIES. 



a small quantity each of lemon peel and salt. Place the lid on the pan, set it on the 
fire and boil until the liquor is reduced to one-half its original quantity, then add a 
lump of butter and a tablespoonful of flour and stir well until the latter is quite 
smooth, or the flour and butter may be worked smooth in a saucepan and the gravy 
strained over. Boil for a few minutes, and the gravy is then ready for use. 



Game Gravy for Mutton. 



Pluck and draw a very high woodcock or snipe, cut it in pieces together with its 
entrails (with the bag taken out), put in a saucepan with sufficient plain and un- 
seasoned meat gravy to a little more than cover, and simmer gently for several hours, 
then strain and serve. This gravy if used for mutton that has been kept for some 
time will give it a strong venison flavor. 

i 

Gravy for Roasted Goose. 

When the goose is roasted or baked turn nearly all of the fat out of the pan, but 
do not pour away the brown part of the drippings. Put the pan over the fire, stir 
into it one piled tablespoonful of flour, and let the flour brown; then stir in a pint of 
boiling water, season the gravy with salt and pepper, boil for a moment, and serve. 

Meat Gravy. 

Cut off the rind from one pound of raw lean ham, put it in a saucepan with 
a little butter, and add four onions, each cut into quarters. Put about six pounds 
of fillet of veal and the same of gravy beef in the saucepan, add one pint of 
general stock, put the pan on the fire and reduce the liquor to a dark glaze, 
taking care not to let it burn. Now add two gallons of stock, one fowl, a bunch 
of herbs and a lump of salt; boil up again, remove the pan to the side of the 
fire and allow the contents to simmer for four hours. Strain through a cloth, 
remove the fat, and it is ready to serve. It may be clarified for jelly if necessary 
with the whites of two eggs and one pound of pounded veal. 

Shallot Gravy. 

Put half a dozen peeled shallots into a saucepan with one wineglassful of vinegar, 
salt and pepper to taste and boil for eight minutes; then add one teacupful of brown 
gravy and boil for ten minutes longer. Before serving the gravy should be strained 
through a sieve. 

Thick Gravy with Fine Herbs. 

Take one large onion, chop it up small and put it in a saucepan with a pat of 
butter and stir over the fire until lightly colored; then put in two and a half break- 



GRAVIES. 503 

fast cupfuls of half glaze and a breakfast cupful of broth and boil until reduced to two- 
thirds; then skim it well, stir in a tablespoonful of chopped mushrooms, one table- 
spoonful of parsley, a pinch of sugar and a little cayenne and boil for five minutes. 
When about to serve squeeze in the strained juice of half a lemon. 



Gravy for Turkey. 



Take an onion and chop as fine as possible. Put it into a fryingpan with a 
little butter and fry until it is dark brown. Put three gills of stock into a saucepan 
with a little finely-chopped ham, a sprig each of parsley and thyme, a little Worces- 
tershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste, then boil for from five to ten minutes. 
Strain into a basin or sauceboat. 



Veal Gravy. 



Take one pound of lean ham cut in slices and a knuckle of veal cut up and put 
them into a well-buttered stewpan with any bones of chickens and rabbits which may 
be at hand; pour two quarts of stock over this, cover it and boil it down to a glase. 
When it is a deep red fill it up with stock; as soon as it boils skim well; add three 
or four cloves, two blades of mace, three good-sized carrots and the same amount of 
chopped celery, onions and turnips. Let it simmer for about three hours, then strain 
it through a tammy sieve into a pan to cool for use. 



Gravy for Venison. 



Take two or three pounds of loin of mutton, remove all the fat and cut it into 
rather thick slices, grill them for a minute or two on one side only so as to slightly 
brown them, put them in a stewpan, pour over one quart of water, place the lid on 
the pan and simmer at the side of the fire for an hour; then take off the lid and boil 
until the liquor is reduced to half its original quantity. Season with salt only when 
wanted for use. 



Gravy for Wild Fowl. 



Put into a small saucepan a blade of mace, a piece of lemon peel, two tablespoon- 
fuls each of mushroom catsup, walnut catsup and strained lemon juice, two shal- 
lots cut in slices; and two wineglassfuls of port wine; put the saucepan over the fire 
and boil the contents; then strain, and add it to the gravy that has come from the 
fowl while roasting. If there should be a large quantity of gravy, less wine, catsup, 
etc., will be necessary, 



Liaisons. 

Liaison of Butter. 

This is merely the addition of a certain quantity of butter at the last moment of 
cooking the sauce. 

Liaison of Butter and Cream. 

The same as liaison of butter with the addition of cream. Beat the butter and 
cream together and stir into the sauce. 

Liaison of Eggs. 

Beat up the yolks of the eggs into some of the sauce after cooling it, and then 
pour this in, stirring slowly. Do not put the eggs in with the hot sauce or they will 
be sure to curdle. 

Liaison of Flour. 

Sometimes the sauce is thickened by dredging into it flour or arrowroot; but the 
better plan is to rub a little till smooth in water, and then pour it into the sauce 
through a strainer. 

Liaison of Roux. 



J J.C1.J.O V/ 1 J. V / JL iX. V-f L i .A 

Place in fryingpan twice as much butter as flour, and then mix together as the 
butter melts, stirring with a spoon until the flour gets red, but be sure not to let it 
burn.

yolks of eggs separately in a bowl ; pour the sauce over the eggs a very little at a 
time ; strain through a strainer, and finish with one half ounce of good butter and the 
juice of half a lemon, taking care that it does not boil a second time. 

American Sauce. 

Chop one fair sized peeled onion very fine, one green pepper and half a peeled 
clove, some garlic ; season with a pinch of salt and three pinches of red pepper, 
together with half a wineglassful of good white wine. This should be reduced for 
two minutes, and add about a gill of tomato sauce, and a fair-sized peeled tomato, cut 
up into dice-shaped pieces. Cook for about ten minutes, and it is ready for use. 

Anchovy Sauce. 

Take three or four filleted anchovies, and beat them in a mortar with three 
ounces of butter. Put this anchovy butter into a stewpan with a wineglassful of

gradually a quarter of a pound of butter, broken into small pieces, and continue 
stirring until it has the appearance of smooth cream. Add a small quantity of lemon- 
juice, and serve in a sauceboat. This is a very good sauce to be served with cold 
slaw. 

Aurora Sauce. 

Mix in a saucepan a small glassful of mushroom liquor with half a pint of hot 
well-seasoned bechamel sauce, half an ounce of butter and two or three tablespoonfuls 
of red tomato sauce. Place on the fire for five minutes, stirring well the while, and 
then add some whole mushrooms cut in squares, and serve, 

Bearnaise Sauce.

pan at the side of the fire, and let the sauce simmer for thirty minutes, stirring it 
often. When cooked, mix with the sauce one half pint of cream, boil it up again, 
then strain it through a fine hair-sieve, and serve. (2.) Put two tablespoonfuls each 
of butter and flour into a saucepan, and stir them over the fire until well mixed; then 
pour in by degrees one pint of white stock, and continue stirring over the fire until 



SAUCES. 507 

boiling. Add eight or nine peeled mushrooms, put the lid half on the saucepan, and 
let the sauce simmer for twenty minutes, skimming off the butter as it rises. Strain 
the sauce through a fine hair-sieve, put it into another saucepan, mix in one-half pint 
of cream and the juice of half a lemon, stir it over the fire, and allow it to boil for 
five or six minutes, then pour the sauce into a basin, and continue stirring until it is 
cold. Mix some aspic jelly with the sauce if used for making a chaudfroid. 

Bechamel Brown Sauce. 

Chop some lean veal, bacon, one carrot, two small onions and one turnip. Put

again and boil it until thick and creamy; mix with it a sprinkling of sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of anchovy sauce, and serve. 



Bigarade Sauce. 



Pare the rinds from two oranges, cut them up into small pieces and boil in a 
saucepan of water for about five minutes, remove and drain. Melt a little butter in 
a saucepan, stir in one tablespoonful of flour and cook until it browns. Pour in a

Procure .four branches of thoroughly washed parsley-stalks, a branch of soup- 
celery also thoroughly cleansed, a blade of bay leaf, a sprig of thyme and a couple 
of cloves placed in the middle of the parsley so as to prevent them from dropping

Preparing Croquettes. 

A good deal of care and practice are required to make croquettes nicely. The 
meat must be chopped fine, the ingredients well mixed, and the mixture as moist as 
possible without preventing the formation. When shaping them take a tablespoonful 
or so of the mixture, and with both hands work it into the form of a cylinder. 
Handle the mixture as gently as possible, for too much pressure wilt force the 
particles apart and spoil the shape. Sprinkle a board lightly with bread or cracker- 
crumbs, and roll the croquettes very gently on this. Allow them to remain on the 
board until they are finished, when, if any have become flattened, roll them into shape 
again. Cover a board thickly with crumbs, have some beaten eggs salted slightly, in 
a deep plate; hold a croquette in the left hand and, with a brush in the right, cover it 
with the egg; roll it in the crumbs, and keep on doing this until they are covered. 
Place a few at a time in a frying basket not allowing them to touch each other 
and plunge the basket into boiling fat; cook until they are of a rich browni Take 
them up, lay on paper, and let drain.

until it begins to boil, then put the bread in and fry it, turning it until nicely browned 
on all sides. Drain the bread on a sieve, and stick onto a dish with some paste 
made of flour and the white of an egg, which will retain it firmly where it is placed. 

Croutons. 

Cut some slices a third of an inch in thickness off a kitchen loaf and cut from

Boiled Eggs. 

The eggs should be warm before boiling; that is, they should not be brought 
from a cold place and boiled Plunge them into boiling water and boil gently for 
three minutes, when the yolks will be soft and the whites a little hardened. The 
whites will become quite hard if boiled for exactly five minutes while the yolks will 
remain soft; if boiled for three or four minutes longer they will be quite hard. For 
salads, they require to be boiled for a quarter of an hour. If the eggs are very cold, 
as they are likely to be in the winter, they can be warmed sufficiently by holding 
them in steam If the shell of an egg should be cracked, prick small holes in the 
thickest part of the egg to prevent the contents from oozing out while boiling.

sauce, pour the sauce around them, garnish with parsley, and serve. 

Easter Eggs. 

To color Easter eggs red, wash them thoroughly and place in a saucepan of 
water with a little cochineal, carmine or logwood, and boil for ten minutes. When 
done leave them in the colored fluid for about five minutes; then take them out, wipe 
dry and rub over with an oiled cloth. Use spinach for green, saffron for yellow. By 
tying the eggs up in the outside skins of onions, a pretty maize is obtained. 

A pretty dish of Easter eggs may be prepared as follows: Pour one pint of cold 
water over one ounce of gelatine, and let it steep for four hours; add one pound of sugar 
and three pints of boiling milk, and stir over the fire until the sugar and the gelatine 
are quite dissolved; then strain and divide into four parts. Stir into one part two 
tablespoonfuls of sweet vanilla-flavored chocolate; into another the beaten yolks of 
two eggs; a little prepared cochineal or very red fruit syrup into the third, and leave 
the fourth white, Flavor the white with rose-water, the red with essence of almonds, 
the brown with vanilla, and the yellow with essence of lemon. Put the yellow portion 
over the fire and let it heat long enough to cook the eggs, stirring continually. Have 
a dozen egg-shells ready, emptied .through a very small hole made at one end of the 
shell, and rinse well in cold water, changing it several times. Do not drain or dry 
them, as the insides must be quite wet when the shells are filled. Fill three shells 
with each of the mixtures, standing them upright in a pan of flour or finely-powdered 
salt, and let them remain all night. On the following day fill a glass dish three parts 
full with white wine jelly cut in pieces, and on this arrange the eggs, having first 
peeled off the shells. Scatter among them candied orange and citron peel cut into 
thin shreds.

the egg over with a skimmer, and cook for a quarter of a minute on the other side; 



EGGS AND OMELETS. 577 

lift it out with the skimmer, and place it on a hot dish. Proceed in the same way with 
eleven more eggs, and they will then be ready to serve. Mix one pinch of salt with 
half a pinch of white pepper, and season each of the eggs with it after they are placed 
on the dish. Care must be taken to cook the eggs separately, and not more than a 
quarter of a minute on each side. 

Fried Eggs for Garnish. 

Pour half a teacupful of sweet oil into a fryingpan; when hot, break in one egg 
carefully, closing up the white part with a skimmer so as to have it firm and compact, 
and cook for two minutes. Only one egg at a time should be in the pan.

and with a fork slightly break the omelet on the bottom as it cooks, so that the 
uncooked portion can run upon the pan, but do not tear the edges of the omelet. 
When the omelet is cooked to the required degree, and it should not be too well 
done, lay the sardines on one side of it, pour the lemon juice or vinegar over them, 
fold the omelet together, enclosing them, then turn it out onto a hot dish, and serve

sheet, and with a pastry cutter, cut into strips four or five inches long and less than a 
quarter of an inch wide. Bake and serve piled in cross triangles or squares. When 
the paste is very hard it is necessary to cut them as narrow as possible, laying them in 
the pans in groups of five or six, with one stalk tied round the middle to represent a 
bundle of straws, and baked in that position.

Wash the hominy well in cold water, put it into an earthenware pan or basin, pour 
over sufficient boiling water to cover, and let it remain all night. Then drain and 
place it over the fire with one quart of water to every pint of hominy, and boil for five 
to six hours, stirring frequently; then drain it quite dry in a colander or sieve, and 
serve hot in a deep dish. It is very palatable when eaten with pork, bacon or beef, 
or almost any kind of meat. Any cold hominy that may be left can be made into 
cakes the following day, with the addition of a little wheat flour, and fried in boiling 
lard, or it may be boiled for an hour, and served as at first. 

Hominy Cakes. 

Boil one quart or so of hominy very soft and add to it one pound of corn meal 
and one teaspoonful of salt. Mix into it three well-beaten eggs and sufficient milk 
to make a thin batter. Beat the batter well for a few minutes, then bake it on a 
griddle, dropping it on in large spoonfuls and making it very thin, or they may be 
baked in waffle-irons. Serve maple syrup with them. Yeast may be used instead 
of eggs, putting one tablespoonful in the batter and allowing it to stand for several 
hours in a warm place to rise. 

Hominy Croquettes. 

Place one pint of cooked hominy in a saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of hot 
milk and stir it over the fire till hot. Remove from the fire, mix a beaten yolk of 
an egg with it, season to taste with salt, and leave till cool. Shape the mixture into 
croquettes, then roll them in breadcrumbs, heat a lump of butter in a fryingyan, put 
in the croquettes and fry them. When browned, drain, lay them on a napkin, and serve. 

Fried Hominy. 

Take some cold boiled hominy and make it into a soft paste by stirring in one 
beaten egg, two tablespoonfuls of warmed butter, and a small quantity of milk; stir the 
mixture over the fire until well incorporated and hot, then turn it onto a dish and 



FARINACEOUS. 599 

leave until cold. Divide it into small round cakes and dredge them lightly with flour; 
put a large lump of butter into a flat stewpan, and when boiling, put in the cakes and 
fry until equally browned. Drain them, pile on a hot dish over which has been 
spread a folded napkin, and serve with cream and sugar, 

Baked Macaroni. 

Put nine ounces of macaroni without breaking it into a saucepan with boiling 
salted water and when done drain, put it into a stewpan, add a little pepper and 
grated nutmeg to taste and thicken with a few tablespoonfuls of bechamel sauce. 
Warm this up on the fire for a few minutes, take it off, toss the pan and add one- 
fourth pound of butter, two ounces each of grated Parmesan and also of grated 
Gruyere cheese and pour the whole into a baking-dish. Sprinkle with a little more 
cheese and gratinate for thirty minutes in the oven; then serve. 

Macaroni, Bolognese Style. 

Break some lasagnaor macaroni into convenient lengths and boil in salted water, 
Thoroughly wash sufficient spinach, using plenty of water, as it is very gritty; put it 
into a saucepan of boiling water with a lump of salt and boil until tender. Drain the 
spinach well, pass it through a fine hair-sieve and put it into a stewpan; moisten with 
a little rich veal gravy and stir it over the fire for a few minutes. When the macaroni 
is cooked drain it, arrange on a deep dish in alternate layers with the spinach, plac- 
ing a good supply of grated Parmesan cheese between each layer, cover the dish and 
place it in a moderately hot oven for about three-quarters of an hour. When ready 
serve the macaroni very hot in the dish in which it was cooked. 

Curried Macaroni. 

Put a quantity of macaroni in a saucepan of salted water and boil for twenty 
minutes; remove, drain, put it in a saucepan with some curry sauce and simmer it 
gently for from five to ten minutes. Keep each piece of macaroni separate and do 
not allow it to be cooked to a paste. Serve it hot. 

Macaroni, Genovese Style. 

Boil half a dozen fresh pork sausages in stock; when cooked drain and let them 
get cold. Boil the necessary quantity of macaroni in salted water and when thor- 
oughly tender turn it out onto a sieve to drain. Cut the sausages in slices and arrange 
them with alternate layers of the macaroni on a deep dish, strewing grated Parmesan 
cheese between each layer. Pour over the contents of the dish some nicely-flavored 
rich veal gravy, cover the dish and place it in a slow oven for about one hour. Serve 
the macaroni very hot in the dish in which it was cooked.

put them into a stewpan with a chopped onion and carrot, and a sufficient quantity 
of butter, and fry until nicely browned, adding one wineglassful of white wine and 
stock to cover. Put in a bunch of sweet herbs, including a few sprigs of parsley, a 
small bottleful of tomato sauce, and a few chopped mushrooms. When boiling move 
the stewpan to the edge of the fire, and stew the contents gently for three hours. 
Next, strain the gravy through a fine sieve; put the other ingredients, with the ex- 
ception of the bundle of herbs, into a mortar, and pound to a smooth paste; then 
return the mixture to the stewpan with the gravy, and boil it gently for twenty 
or thirty minutes longer. Boil the required quantity of macaroni and drain it well; 
cut some milk cheese into slices. Strain the gravy into another stewpan, put in two 
ounces of butter broken into small pieces, and keep it hot at the edge of the fire. 
Arrange the macaroni and slices of cheese in layers in a deep dish with grated Par- 
mesan cheese over them, moisten with the above gravy, dust a small quantity of 
powdered cinnamon over the top, and cover the dish. Place it in a slow oven, and 
leave for an hour. At the end of that time take it out of the oven, and serve while 
very hot in the same dish. 



Macaroni, Neapolitan Style. 



Place a saucepan of water on the fire, boil it up, and put into it one heaping 
teaspoonful of salt; as soon as it boils up again, throw in one pound of macaroni, let 
it boil for half an hour, then drain in a colander. Grate six or eight ounces of 
cheese; put a layer of the boiled macaroni in a deep dish, sprinkle it with grated

Stewed Macaroni. 

Simmer one-fourth pound of macaroni in enough water to cover; when soft, turn 
it onto a sieve, drain, and leave until cold. Put in one teaspoonful of salt, taking 
care not to allow the macaroni to break or lose its shape. Chop very fine all the 
white meat of a fowl and three or four slices of ham, and season to taste with salt, 
white pepper and grated Parmesan cheese. Beat well with the yolks of three eggs, 
and the white of one separately. Mix the minced fowl and ham into the beaten 
yolks, stir in one-fourth pint of cream, then beat in lightly the frothed white of egg, 
and carefully mix in the macaroni. Butter a mould, place the mixture into it, cover 
it closely, and steam for an hour. Turn out onto a hot dish, pour some gravy over, 
and serve hot. 

Macaroni Timbales. 

Put one-half pound of macaroni into a saucepan of salted water, and boil until 
tender, drain, and cut it into pieces about two inches in length. Reduce one wine- 
glassful of bechamel sauce in a saucepan over the fire, stirring in gradually a few 
tablespoonfuls of gravy; when well flavored, remove it from the fire, and pour it on 
the macaroni, together with a little powdered cinnamon and five ounces of butter. 
Meanwhile butter a timbale mould, sprinkle with the breadcrumbs, and line with 
sweetened tartlet-paste. Pour in the preparation, cover it with a flat of the paste, 
and place it in a moderate oven to bake. In about forty-five minutes remove it from 
the oven, place it on a dish, sprinkle over sugar flavored with cinnamon, and serve. 

Macaroni with Cheese. 

Put plenty of water in a large saucepan together with a lump of salt, and place 
it over the fire; when the water boils quickly throw in the macaroni, first breaking it 
into moderate lengths. Stir frequently until tender then pour in a jugful of cold 
water, and drain the water off. Put about one-fourth pound of butter in a stewpan, 
and place it over the fire until lightly browned; turn the macaroni onto a hot dish, 
pour over the butter, strew plenty of grated Parmesan cheese over it, and serve. 

Macaroni with Cream. 

Boil in plenty of salted water for three quarters of an hour three-fourths of a 
pound of macaroni, adding one-half ounce of butter and one cnion stuck with two 
cloves. Drain well, and put it back into a saucepan with one-third of a pound each 
of butter, grated Parmesan and grated Gruyere cheese, a pinch of pepper, and a little 
nutmeg. Moisten with one-half pint of white broth and four tablespoonfuls of cream. 
Cook all together for five minutes, stirring well, and when the macaroni is soft, dish 
it up, and serve.

Macaroni with Gravy. 



Prepare a small quantity of veal gravy, skim off the fat and mix with it a few 
tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, a little raw ham, a small bunch of sweet herbs, and a 
small quantity of pepper. Place this at the side of the fire and let it simmer until 
wanted. Meanwhile boil some macaroni in a little salted water ; when tender drain, 
and before it gets cold take up small quantities with a skimmer and put them in 
layers in a deep dish. Cover each layer with grated Parmesan cheese, moisten with 
a little of the gravy strained through a sieve and mixed with a little butter, and serve 
very hot. If the gravy is too thin, thicken it with a little meat-glaze. 

Macaroni with Ham. 

Put two ounces of macaroni broken in pieces in a saucepan with one pint of 
highly seasoned stock, and boil until tender ; add a little salt, pepper and butter, and 
turn it onto a hot dish with two ounces of minced cooked fat ham or streaky bacon, 
sprinkle over a few fried breadcrumbs, and serve. 



Macaroni with Kidneys. 



Boil one-fourth pound of macaroni. Remove the fat from half a dozen mutton 
kidneys, or one beef kidney, skin them, cut them open, season with salt, cayenne and 
powdered mixed herbs and fry in butter, browning nicely on both sides; then stir in 
three-fourths of a pint of gravy flavored with tomatoes. Place the kidneys on a hot 
dish, surround them with the boiled macaroni, pour over the gravy, and sprinkle with 
a little salt and pepper and some chopped hard-boiled eggs, with a sprinkling of 
grated Parmesan cheese. 

Macaroni with Tomatoes. 

Break one-fourth pound of macaroni in lengths of about three inches, plunge 
them into a saucepan of boiling salted water, and boil for twenty minutes or so until 
done. Take them out, drain, and put them in a baking-dish; mix in one ounce of 
grated Parmesan cheese, one teacupful of stewed tomatoes, an equal quantity of 
brown meat gravy, a lump of butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Place the dish in 
a slack oven, allow the mixture to simmer gently for thirty minutes, and serve. It need 
not be baked unless desired, and care must be exercised to see that the flavor of the 
tomatoes is not too strong, and also that it is not salted too much. 

Noodles. 

These are virtually the same, the former being a French adaptation of the original 
German paste; but national tastes have served in a measure to modify the shapes and 



FARINACEOUS. 603 

applications, as will be seen in the following recipes, which are classified, in order to 
avoid confusion, into noodles, nudles and dampf-nudels. The paste is similar in all 
cases, consisting essentially of eggs and flour. 

Baked Noodles. 

Boil a sufficient quantity of noodles in water, drain thoroughly, and put them in a 
stewpan with enough cold milk to cover; two ounces of butter, about four ounces of 
grated Parmesan cheese, and pepper and grated nutmeg to taste. Toss the noodles over 
the fire for several minutes, then pile them on a hot dish, strew plenty of grated bread- 
crumb over, and brown them in a brisk oven. Serve very hot. 

Noodles with Parmesan Cheese. 

Put two ounces of butter into a saucepan placed on a hot stove, and when melted, 
mix in one and one-half ounces of flour, a little salt, a very little cayenne and a tea- 
cupful of milk. Work these to a firm paste and add three eggs and four ounces of 
grated Parmesan cheese. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, take the prepara- 
tion up in small quantities with a spoon, drop them in the boiling water and boil for 
a quarter of an hour. Take them out, drain, place them on a hot dish, garnish with a 
folded napkin or fancy dish-paper, and serve with a sauceboatful of rich brown sauce. 

Nudels. 

Although made of the same kind of paste as the noodles, the peculiarity of 
these according to German ideas is that they are cut into shreds or thin strips. Mix 
in a basin one teaspoonful of salt with one-half pound of flour, then mix in four 
beaten eggs and work the dough until smooth. Dredge flour over a paste-board, place 
the dough on it and knead well. Roll the dough very thin and then twist 
it up like a rolled jelly-cake, cut half the roll into strips one-half inch 
thick and the other into strips one-fourth inch thick, place the wider strips of 
paste in a saucepan of boiling water and boil for fifteen minutes. Put one-fourth 
pound of butter into a flat stewpan, and when blue smoke arises, throw in the narrow 
strips of paste and fry till lightly browned. Turn the boiled strips of paste, when 
done, on a sieve, drain and lay on a hot dish on which has been placed a folded 
napkin or an ornamental dish-paper. Next, drain the other strips as free from fat as 
possible and pile on the top of the boiled ones. Strew powdered sugar over them, 
and serve with cream. 



Dampf-Nudels, Polish Style. 



Put one and one-half pounds of dampf-nudel paste and set it in a warm place to 
rise. Then turn out on a floured board and work it well with the hands for a few 



604 FARINACEOUS. 

minutes; let it get quite cold, roll out very thin and with a small tin cutter, cut it into 
rounds. Have prepared some apple marmalade reduced and mixed with rum, put a 
little of this on each round, fold over the paste and turn them upside down on a but- 
tered baking-sheet. Place where they will keep warm for forty-five minutes to rise, 
then brush them over with warm butter, put them with the baking-sheet into a moderate 
oven and bake until done. Remove the baking-sheet, dredge a little fine sugar over 
them, glaze slightly, lay a napkin over a dish and place them on in a pyramidal form, 
and serve. 

Italian Paste. 

What is known by this name is merely an admixture of fine wheat flour and 
water, used chiefly in the manufacture of macaroni and vermicelli. 

Macaroni Paste. 

This consists essentially of the best white flour moistened with water. It is most 
generally known as Italian paste. 

Indian Pilau. 

Throw one teacupful of rice into fast-boiling water, let it boil for twenty min- 
utes, then drain through a colander or sieve. Stir in one ounce of butter and a little 
pepper and salt. Pile the rice in a hot dish, garnish with quarters of hard-boiled eggs 
and surround it with onions fried till dry. 

Rice Pilau. 

Throw half a pound of rice into a saucepan with plenty of cold water, add a 
small lump of salt and place it over the fire till it boils. After the rice has cooked 
for five minutes drain off the water, freshen it with 'cold water, drain that off also, 
cover the rice with a thick folded-cloth and leave it by the edge of the fire until 
swollen and soft. Put one-half pound of fresh butter into a basin and place it in the 
oven or near the fire until dissolved, then remove any scum that may have gathered 
on the top, and pour the butter over the rice. It is then ready for serving. 

Turkish Pilau. 

Put a breakfast cupful of stewed and strained tomatoes in a saucepan with one- 
half pint of broth, one minced onion and season well with pepper and salt. When 
boiling put one breakfast cupful of well-washed rice in, stir it lightly till the liquor is 
absorbed, then put in one teacupful of butter. Place the pan over a slow fire and 
steam for twenty minutes. Remove the lid, stir the pilau lightly, cover with a cloth 
and let the steam escape; add a breakfast cupful of chopped and cooked meat if de- 
sired. Serve the pilau as a vegetable without the meat and as an entree with it. 



FARINACEOUS. 605 

Polenta and Cheese. 

Stir into some boiling water enough polenta, adding a little salt; then move the 
saucepan to the side of the fire and boil until done, say from fifteen to twenty min- 
utes. Pour into a basin and let it cool; then turn out of the basin, cut it into slices, 
trimming them to one size; butter a pie-dish and place the polenta in, in layers with 
grated cheese, salt and a little cayenne strewn over each layer. Sprinkle the cheese, 
liberally over the top, and put the dish in a quick oven until nicely browned on top 
and serve while hot in the dish it is cooked in. 

Polenta Timbale, Milanese. 

Place three pints of salted water in a saucepan on the fire and when boiling re- 
move to the side, scatter in one pound of polenta, simmer it gently until it becomes 
quite thick, then add a little butter and stir thoroughly. Pour it into a well-buttered 
timbale mould and let it cool for four or five hours; next turn the loaf of polenta out 
of the mould, wipe the mould inside and again butter it, sprinkle in a few sifted 
breadcrumbs and replace the loaf in the mould; cut out a round from the flat portion 
and scoop out some of the inside, leaving about half an inch in thickness all over; 
cut into slices a couple of blanched sweetbreads, sprinkle over them a little salt and 
pepper and place them in a saucepan with a little warm butter and fry until the meat 
is set; next pour over a cupful of white wine and add to this twelve mushrooms cut 
into quarters and eight ounces of lean ham or bacon cut into small pieces; place the 
lid on the pan and reduce the liquor quickly to a glaze; pour in a little Spanish sauce 
and a few tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce mixed in with it and add two dozen small 
veal quenelles which have been rolled in flour and poached. Pass this preparation 
through into the hollow of the loaf of polenta and cover over the top with the piece 
which was cut off, fastening it on with a little forcemeat or a little of the liquid 
polenta; spread some butter over the top, place the mould in the oven and let it re- 
main there for nearly one hour, then turn it out onto a dish; loosen it by pushing a 
knife between the loaf and the mould, and it is then ready to be served with a gar- 
nish of potato croquettes. 

Baked Ravioles. 

Take one-fourth pound of veal, four ounces of calf's liver, three ounces of 
sausage-meat, four ounces of either beef-marrow or calf's-kidney fat, and a little mixed 
powdered herbs; mince all very fine, season with salt and pepper, and pound in a 
mortar; add a handful of spinach, which ha3 been blanched, boiled, drained, and 
warmed in butter the same quantity of curd cheese, which has been squeezed in a 
cloth, so as to extract all the milk, and pound again; then stir in the yolks of two 
eggs, and whisk up the whites and add them to it. Make some short paste as for 
rissoles, and cut it into small squares; wet the edges and fold them over a little of 



606 FARINACEOUS. 

ihe forcemeat placed in the center, and poach in boiling stock for five minutes; then 
drain, place on a dish, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese, moisten with stock, 
brown in the oven, and serve very hot. 



Ravioles for Soups. 



Divide one pound of noodles into halves, and roll them both out very thin, 
having them of an equal size and as nearly square as possible. Put any kind of 
forcemeat into a paper funnel and squeeze it out in small lumps, in rows, over one of 
the halves, keeping the lumps about one inch apart, cover with the remaining half of 
the paste, pressing it down between the forcemeat, and then cut out the ravioles with 
a small, round tin cutter, say about one and one-half inches in diameter. As they 
are done, place them upon a well-floured cloth, using only half of it, and covering 
over with the other half. When all the ravioles are cut, plunge them into a sauce- 
pan of boiling water, and boil them for three minutes; then remove the pan from the 
fire, put on the cover, and let it stand for four minutes longer. Place the ravioles 
on a sieve to drain, put them in a sautepan, pour over four ounces of melted butter, 
and strew over a few tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese. Warm them for 
a minute, remove the pan from the fire, and toss it; then remove the ravioles with 
a skimmer, place them on a dish, sprinkle them over with a little more grated Parmesan 
cheese, and pour over a few tablespoonfuls of hot glaze, mixed with an equal quan- 
tity of tomato sauce. A tureenful of rich soup should always accompany these. 

Rice Border. 

Arrange plain boiled rice in a circle, as for serving curry, or work it into a border- 
mould, as follows: Wash thoroughly in two or three waters one breakfast cupful of 
rice, place it in a saucepan with three breakfast cupfuls of cold water, and boil 
slowly for half an hour ; then stir in two tablespoonfuls of butter and one tablespoon- 
ful of salt. Beat this mixture up until it is very smooth, and then add two well- 
beaten eggs. Stir thoroughly, place the mixture in a buttered border-mould, and 
stand it in the oven for a few minutes. Turn it out onto a dish and fill the center 
with curry, or anything else prepared for the purpose. 

Rice Case or Croustade. 

Put eight ounces of rice into a saucepan with one quart of water and one ounce 
of butter or fat from cooked bacon, sprinkle in salt and pepper to taste, and boil until 
the rice is quite tender and dry. Place it in a mortar, pound it well, form it into the 
shape of a ball on a baking-sheet, and then into the shape of a raised pie. Brush it 
over both inside and out with warmed butter, set it in the oven to color, take it out, 
and it is then ready for use. It may be filled with forcemeat, sausage-balls, or any- 
thing else that is desired.

Rice Croquettes, Italian Style. 

Put two breakfast cupfuls of rice into a saucepan, and boil it with milk, so that 
when it is done it will be soft and pasty. Meanwhile chop fine half of a cold 
cooked fat liver, season, put it into a basin, and mix in a third of its bulk of truffles 
also cut fine. Pour one breakfast cupful of bechamel sauce into a saucepan, add" 
the trimmings of the truffles, reduce the liquor and add one teacupful of thick gravy 
or melted glaze; when the mixture is of a good consistency, strain it into the basin 
with the fat liver. Pack the basin in ice, and when the mixture is quite cold, take a 
little up at a time in a small spoon, roll it into a pear-shape, and cover it with the 
rice, taking care to see that it is firm. When they are all done, dip them into egg 
and breadcrumbs, fry them carefully in boiling fat, drain them, place them on a nap- 
kin, spread over a dish, garnish neatly with fried parsley, and serve. 

Croustades of Rice, Queen Style. 

Wash well, and boil in a saucepan one quart of rice with two quarts of broth and 
one ounce of butter. Keep it as dry as possible, so that it remain firm, and add to it 
one ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, one teaspoonful of pepper, and one-third tea- 
spoonful of grated nutmeg. Stir well with a wooden spoon, and then put in a but- 
tered sautepan, spreading it about two inches thick, and covering it with a piece of 
buttered paper. Leave it to cool, with a weight pressed down on the top. Then cut 
it out with a paste-cutter into half a dozen croustades (being careful to dip the cutter 
into warm water each time it is used), and with a smaller paste-cutter, make a mark 
on the surface of each without cutting. Dip the pieces in beaten egg, roll them in 
breadcrumbs, and repeat this operation; then fry them in very hot lard for five min- 
utes, drain, empty them with a vegetable spoon, and fill the insides with a hot salpicon 
of shrimps, mushrooms and cream sauce. Place the covers on the top, and serve 'on 
a dish covered with a folded napkin. 

Curried Rice. 

Mix smoothly one dessertspoonful of curry-paste with one tablespoonful of rich 
brown gravy; place it in a saucepan with one breakfast cupful more of the gravy and 
boil; then add to it one pound of well-washed rice, and simmer it gently at the side 
of the fire for thirty minutes, or until the rice is done. Turn it out onto a dish, 
squeeze over the juice of half a lemon, and serve. 

Fried Rice. 

Boil the rice and cool it in a dish; when it is cold, turn it from the dish, cut it 
into slices nearly one inch thick, season them with salt and pepper, and then roll 
them in cornmeal. Have in readiness a frying-kettle half full of smoking-hot fat, and

fry the pieces of rice in it until they are of a golden brown. Remove them from the 
fat with a skimmer, place them on brown paper for a moment to free them from 
grease, and serve. 

Rice in Turkish Style. 

Put three pints of clear stock into a saucepan with plenty of tomato sauce and 
salt and pepper to taste; when it boils, throw in one and one-half pounds of well- 
washed and dried rice, and let it simmer until the mixture is well absorbed by the 
rice. Melt a large lump of butter, pour it over the rice, and leave it by the side of 
the fire for a few minutes. When ready to serve, stir the rice well, and turn it onto 
a hot dish. 

Rice Menagere. 

Put six ounces of well-washed rice into a saucepan of boiling water, and blanch 
it for five or six minutes; then remove and drain it. Blanch four or five ounces of 
streaky bacon, cut it up into pieces about one inch square, put them into a deep 
fryingpan and fry them until they are yellow, then add the rice, a small quantity of 
pepper, and about three breakfast cupfuls of rich broth. Stir often over the fire for 
about twenty minutes, then remove the pan from the fire, add one breakfast cupful 
of tomato sauce, turn the whole onto a dish, and serve. 

Rice Milanese. 

Pour one teacupful of milk into a saucepan on the fire, when it boils add one 
teacupful of well-washed rice, and a small quantity of finely-chopped onion. Cover 
the pan and boil slowly for about twenty minutes, by which time the rice should be 
soft and dry. Add a little saffron worked up with one ounce of butter, one ounce 
of grated cheese, and pepper and salt to taste. Stir well, and let the mixture remain 
on the side of the fire for ten minutes, turn it out onto a dish, and serve. 

Rice Patties. 

Put one-fourth pound of well-washed rice into a saucepan with sufficient white 
stock to more than cover it, and boil slowly at the side of the fire until the rice is soft 
and the liquor all absorbed. A small quantity of milk should be added to the broth 
to give the rice a white appearance. Add a handful of grated Parmesan cheese to 
flavor, and when the rice is nearly of a jelly turn it out into a pan, keeping it about 
two inches in thickness. Cut the preparation into rounds with a tin cutter. 

Rissotto. 

Peel and mince fine one small onion; put one ounce of butter into a stewpan 
with one-half tablespoonful of flour, and stir it over the fire; when well mixed, put in 



FARINACEOUS. 609 

the onion, and fry it until lightly browned. Wash one-fourth pound of rice, drain it, 
add it to the onion, pour in enough clear stock to cook it in, and boil until the grains 
have swollen but not mashed to a pulp. Shake the stewpan occasionally, but do not 
stir the rice with a spoon. When it is cooked, season it to taste with pepper and salt, 
and strain in a small quantity of lemon juice. Turn the rissotto onto a hot dish, 
strew some grated Parmesan cheese over it, and serve without delay. 

Milanese Rissotto. 

Peel and mince fine a small onion, put it into a stewpan with three ounces of 
butter, and fry it until it commences to brown; then put in one breakfast cupful of 
well-washed rice. Fry it for seven or eight minutes, and pour in just enough stock to 
boil the rice in. Add a pinch of saffron, and let it boil slowly and gently until 
tender. When the rice is soft, mix with it one breakfast cupful of grated Parmesan 
cheese, and stir it over the fire until the cheese has melted. Cut three rounds of 
bread, toast it to a light brown, then trim off the crusts. Butter the toast and lay it 
on a hot dish. Season the rice-mixture to taste with salt and pepper, turn it onto the 
toast, and serve.

truffles and a small piece of cooked, smoked red beef tongue, all cut up dice-shaped; 
season with one-half pinch of pepper and one-third of a pinch of grated nutmeg, 
adding one-fourth of a pound of grated Parmesan cheese. Cook for ten minutes and 
serve with some cheese, separately. 



Spaghetti with Cheese. 



Put one-fourth of a pound of spaghetti, broken into small pieces, in a saucepan 
of boiling water, with a lump of salt, and boil for twenty minutes. Drain the spag- 
hetti, and place it in a buttered baking-dish. Put one breakfast cupful of grated 
cheese into a saucepan with one teacupful of milk, and a lump of butter the size of an 
egg, and stir them over the fire until the cheese is nearly melted. Beat the yolks of 
two eggs together with one teacupful of milk, then stir them in with the cheese, and 
pour the whole over the spaghetti, and bake in a quick oven till of a rich yellow 
color. The cheese will be rendered tough if cooked too long. The spaghetti should 
be served while very hot. 

Spaghetti with Cream Sauce. 

Take one handful of the stick macaroni without breaking it, plunge it into boiling 
salted water, and boil until tender. As the stick softens, bend and coil it in the water, 
but be careful not to break. When cooked drain the spaghetti, and pour cold water 
through it. Serve with cream sauce. 

Welsh Rabbit. 

(1) Chop fine one quarter of a pound of cooking-cheese, put it in a saucepan 
with two ounces of butter, and as the cheese gets warm and the butter melts, mash 
them together. When softened, add the yolks of two eggs, one-half teacupful of 
beer, and a small quantity of cayenne and salt. Stir until it becomes creamy, but do 
not permit it to boil, as that would spoil it. Place some slices of buttered toast on a 
dish, pour the Welsh rabbit over, and place in the oven for about two minutes before 
serving. Some persons prefer milk in place of beer. 

(2) Take one-fourth pound of cheese, and, if soft, break it into small pieces; 
but if hard, grate it. Place half a teacupful of milk in a double boiler and add 
the cheese. Mix one teaspoonful of mustard and a little cayenne, and one teaspoonful 
of salt, add an egg, and beat well. After the cheese has melted, add the egg mix- 
ture and one teaspoonful of butter; then cook for two minutes longer, or until it is 
done, taking care not to let it curdle. Pour the mixture over four slices of toast, free 
from crusts, and that have been kept warm, and then serve. Ale may be used in 
place of the milk, or cream, if preferred. 



FARINACEOUS. 611 

(3) Cut up into small pieces one pound of American cheese, place them in a 
saucepan, pour over half a tumblerful of good ale, and season with half a saltspoon- 
ful of cayenne pepper. Stir with a wooden spoon continually over the fire until the 
mixture is well melted, which will take about ten minutes. Have previously pre- 
pared six large pieces of toast, arrange them on a very hot dish, pour over the prep- 
aration, spreading it equally, and serve very hot. 

Baked Welsh Rabbit. 

Cut six slices of bread, toast slightly, cover with Gruyere cheese cut into slices a 
little less than one-half an inch thick, and lay them in a roasting pan, sprinkling over 
pepper and salt to taste, and cover with browned breadcrumbs. Place the pan in the 
oven for about ten minutes. Arrange the toast on a hot dish, and serve. 



Welsh Rabbit, Oscar Style. 



For one rabbit, take a quarter of a pound of good American cheese, cut it in 
small pieces, take also a pinch of Paprika pepper, a pinch of powdered English mus- 
tard and about half a wineglassful of Rhine wine and half a wineglassful of Bass ale. 
Cook the whole together on a hot stove until the rabbit is well dissolved, and serve it 
with a piece of toast in a very hot dish. 



Hot Desserts. 

Apple Float. 

Rub a sufficient quantity of stewed apples through a coarse sieve, or mash them 
thoroughly. Sweeten with sugar and flavor with nutmeg, and add a spoonful at a 
time to the well-beaten whites of eggs (four eggs to each quart of apples used). Put 
in some cream and season with nutmeg at the bottom of the dish, placing the apples 
on top. Put in the oven for twenty minutes, and serve either hot or cold. 

Fried Apples. 

The apples should be cut into slices unpeeled and fried, a few at a time, in a 
large fryingpan with enough fat or lard to cover the bottom of the pan. When the 
slices are brown on one side, turn them over with a knife. Then place in a dripping- 
pan and put in the oven. If desired the slices of apple may be placed in flour before 
frying, and if soaked in cognac or rum the result is agreeable. 

Baked Apples. 

Core and peel some good cooking apples and set them nearly touching each 
other in a shallow bakingpan; mix a teaspoonful of grated lemon rind with each six 
teaspoonfuls of sugar requisite, and fill the cavities caused by the removal of the 
cores, pour in a sufficient quantity of water to cover the bottom of the pan, and bake 
in a very quick oven until soft, basting frequently with the syrup formed of the water 
and sugar. 

Apricot Snowballs. 

Divide a sufficient quantity of boiled rice into six equal parts, and spread each 
over a small, wet pudding-cloth placed over a small basin to about a third of an inch 
in thickness. Cut half a dozen apricots only sufficient to extract the stones, fill the 
cavities with a little of the cooked rice, put them in the center of the rice, and draw 
the cloths gently around until the apricots are covered with the rice; then tie them 
securely, and put them in a steamer over a saucepan of boiling water and steam for 
ten minutes. Take out carefully and remove the cloths, put them on a dish and pour 
over a little sauce made from apricot syrup, and serve.

HOT DESSERTS. 613 

Baked Bananas. 

Remove the skin from the bananas and cut them lengthwise in halves and arrange 
at the bottom of a baking-dish close together. Sprinkle them over with sugar, with 
a few lumps of butter on top and a little grated nutmeg over the whole, and bake in 
a moderate oven for twenty minutes. By this time the bananas should be well glazed, 
and if there is not sufficient of their own liquor to baste them with add a little to the 
dish a few minutes before taking out of the oven. They should be served with cake 
and milk. 

Apple Charlotte. 

Take a loaf of stale bread and, after removing all the crusts with a sharp knife, 
cut up the crumb into slices a third of an inch thick, and these slices again into fancy 
shapes, such as hearts, triangles, squares, rounds, etc. Cut out a round an inch and 
a half in diameter and lay in the center of the bottom of a round tin mould, then 
shape out several hearts large enough for the points to rest on the disc, while their 
rounded points touch the sides of the mould. Next cut some slices of the bread into 
rectangular strips and set them around the sides of the mould, standing upright, rest- 
ing on the round ends of the hearts and overlapping each other. Dip each piece of 
bread in warmed butter before setting in the mould. Have ready some thick apple 
marmalade prepared thus: Peel and core some apples and cut them into slices, then 
place in a saucepan and put in some sugar, the peel of a lemon cut thin and a bit of 
cinnamon tied together. Moisten with a little water. Put upon the stove and boil 
and then let simmer until the apples fall. Remove and take out the lemon peel and 
cinnamon and stir briskly with a wooden spoon until the marmalade is of a stiff con- 
sistency. Pour this into the bread-lined mould and cover the top with a slice of 
bread dipped in the warmed butter and cut to fit the mould. Put the charlotte into 
a brisk oven and bake until the bread is a golden brown. Turn out onto a dish and 
sprinkle caster sugar over it and then glaze it with a very hot salamander, pouring 
apricot marmalade around the dish; or, instead of the glazed sugar, cover the char- 
lotte over with apricot marmalade. 

Peach Charlotte. 

Peel six peaches, cut them in halves and take out their stones; chop them in 
little pieces, put them in a basin, sprinkle some vanilla sugar over and one wineglass- 
ful of rum. Cut some thin slices of cake into fingers and line a charlotte mould with 
them, letting them overlap each other. Stand the mould in a basin and surround it 
with pounded ice. In fifteen minutes put a layer of peaches at the bottom of the 
mould. Whip a little unset jelly with some maraschino, then pour sufficient into the 
mould to cover the peaches. Leave it till the jelly has set, then put in another layer 
of peaches and some more jelly; continue in the same manner till the mould is full, 



614 HOT DESSERTS. 

allowing the jelly to set before another layer is put in. Lay a cover over the mould 
and keep it in ice for half an hour. Turn the charlotte out of the mould onto a dish, 
dip a paste-brush in some maraschino and brush all round to flavor it. Peel three 
whole peaches, cut them in quarters, garnish round the base of the charlotte with 
them, pour some maraschino syrup over, and serve. 

Pear Charlotte. 

Cut some thin slices of stale bread, without the crust, and cut out a round with a 
one and one-half inch in diameter tin-cutter, then cut some heart-shaped pieces of 
bread, and dip them and the round piece in warmed butter. Put the latter at the 
bottom of a plain round charlotte mould, arrange the heart-shaped pieces overlapping 
each other round it, cut the slices of bread into strips one and one-half inches wide 
and of the height of the mould, dip them in butter and stand them all round the 
mould, also overlapping each other. Pare and core fifteen pears, cut them in quar- 
ters, put them in a sautepan with a little butter and vanilla sugar, and fry them. Put 
the pears in the mould when cooked, and brown the charlotte in the oven. Turn the 
charlotte out on a hot dish, mask it with reduced apricot jam, and serve. 



Pineapple Charlotte. 

A charlotte mould should be lined with paper and some lady-fingers pointed on 
one side and arranged like a rosette with their glazed sides at the bottom of the 
mould; then place some long thin biscuits the same height as the mould, around the 
sides, standing upright, and place the mould in pounded ice. Mix with a pint of pine- 
apple syrup, three-quarters of an ounce of dissolved gelatine, a small quantity of 
grated lemon-peel and the juice of an orange ; strain the liquor through a sieve into a sugar- 
boiler and stir it over a fire until it becomes of the consistency of cream, then remove 
and mix with it half a pint of whipped cream and half a pound of either fresh pine- 
apple cut into small pieces, or the preserved pineaple. Then fill the lined mould 
with this preparation and leave it for about an hour to become set. Turn the char- 
lotte out onto a folded napkin, and serve. 

Conde Apricots. 

Divide and remove the kernels from some apricots and stew in a light syrup 
until done, together with the rind of a little lemon, pared thin. Next prepare a bor- 
der of rice suited to the dish to be used and fill the center with the apricot; pour 
some whipped cream over it just before serving with a sprinkle of pistachio nuts 
chopped very fine. 

Apple Croquettes. 

An apple marmalade is prepared as for apple-bread and formed by the hands 
into the shape of pears. Have two or three well-whisked eggs in a dish or basin, dip 



HOT DESSERTS. 615 

each croquette into this and throw them afterwards into a dish of very fine bread- 
crumbs. Smooth them over with a knife and dip a second time into the egg. Fry 
in a sautepan of very best lard until the bread colors a golden brown. Remove and 
place on a sieve to drain and then pile pyramid-fashion on a folded napkin and dust 
freely with sifted sugar which has been flavored with orange. 



Rice Croquettes (Sweet.) 



Put one-half pint of well-washed rice into a saucepan with one pint of water, or 
milk and water in equal proportions, and steam for half an hour, or until the rice is 
quite soft. When it is still hot, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one teaspoonful of 
butter, the yolk of an egg well beaten, and a small quantity of hot milk, if required, 
to moisten it. Let it get cool; then make it into oval shapes, and put them into 
breadcrumbs, egg, and then crumbs again, and fry for a few minutes in boiling fat 
until done and light brown in color. After making the mixture into oval shapes, 
some cooks push the thumb into the center of each, and in the cavity place two boiled 
raisins or candied cherries, or a little jelly or marmalade, then press the rice over the 
hole again; then dip in breadcrumbs, after in egg, and lastly in crumbs, and fry. 

Fruit Crusts. 

Cut slices of stale bread into pieces one inch thick with an oval cutter, also some 
others of a round shape; scoop out a small hollow in the center of them, fry in butter 
until lightly browned, and mask them inside with a little orange marmalade. Mix 
some preserved cherries with a salpicon of preserved fruits, thicken it with a little 
apricot marmalade, and add a little Madeira or sherry wine; put some fruit in the 
hollow of each crust. Fry a thick, round, flat block of bread, put it in the center 
of a dish and arrange the oval crusts almost upright, leaning around it; lay the 
round crusts on the top, stick some fruits on silver skewers and fix them in the 
top of the bread support. Mask the bottom of the dish and the crusts with a little 
apricot sauce to which has been added a little Madeira, and serve with more sauce 
in a sauceboat, with a few Smyrna raisins that have been boiled in syrup for two 
minutes mixed up in it. 

Pineapple Crusts. 

Place in a basin one pound of the best sifted flour, make a hollow in the 
center and put in it half an ounce of German yeast and a tablespoonful of warmed 
milk. Stir in sufficient amount of flour to form a sponge, then set it to rise in 
a warm place. When it has risen to twice its original size, work in the remainder 
of the flour a teacupful of tepid milk and a couple of eggs; then add another 
egg, three-quarters of a pound of butter beaten until creamy, with a tablespoonful 
of caster sugar, a little salt and half a teacupful of warm milk; work the paste thor- 
oughly and add eight more eggs, one at a time. Butter a plain cylinder-mould 



616 HOT DESSERTS. 

eight inches in diameter, and pour in the cake mixture and bake; when it may 
be turned out of the mould and left until cold. Cut into slices and lay on a baking- 
sheet, dredge well with caster sugar and glaze in an oven. Then peel and slice some 
pineapples, place in a stewpan with some thin syrup and simmer them gently; set the 
trimmings of the pineapple in a mortar, and pound them thoroughly, then strain 
through a fine sieve, and arranging the crusts and pineapple slices alternately on 
the dish, forming them in a circle. Boil the syrup in which the pineapples have 
been cooked, till it is reduced to 32 degrees, when it may be mixed with the pounded 
pineapple, and the whole strained through a fine hair-sieve over the crusts and 
pineapple. Then serve. 

Apple Custard. 

Take some apple marmalade or stewed apples, and warm up with a little finely- 
powdered sugar, let this stand in a basin until cold. Beat up some eggs until very 
light and stir and beat them well into some new milk ; a little cream enriches the 
custard. Mix this up with the apples, pour into a deep dish, and bake for twenty 
minutes. 

Apple Custard with Vanilla. 

Strongly flavor with vanilla half a pound of marmalade (apple), and squeeze 
through a tammy cloth. Work up three ounces of warmed butter with a spoon in a 
basin until creamed, gradually putting into it the yolks of a dozen eggs and the white 
of one. When this is worked frothy, add two tablespoonfuls of finely-powdered loaf 
sugar and the apple marmalade. Stir well and throw in a couple of handfuls of rata- 
fia biscuits. Pour the whole into a buttered mould, and let it poach for some time in 
the bain-marie. Turn out onto a warmed dish, and mask with almond cream, thick- 
ened with apricot marmalade. 



Baked Apple Dumplings. 



These are made with a good short or tart crust. First pare the apples whole, and 
then cut out the core with a corer, filling up the cavity with sugar, butter and a little 
cinnamon or a clove. Cut some rounds of paste rather larger than the apples, and 
cover them leaving no openings. The dumplings should be baked in a pan, and the 
juice which will ooze out should be retained, as by adding butter and nutmeg it forms 
a capital sauce in which to serve them. Before the dumplings are quite done 
(they usually take about an hour in a quick oven), the tops should be moistened 
and a small quantity of sugar sprinkled over them to glaze. The dumplings are 
sometimes baked in a pan or deep baking-dish nearly full of a rich sauce, made of 
water, sugar and a good-sized lump of butter, together with a little cinnamon. They 
should be well covered with this syrup a little being poured over them before 
serving. 



HOT DESSERTS. 617 

Boiled Apple Dumplings. 

Pare some large apples, cut them into quarters, and take out the cores. Take 
a piece of crust made from good puff paste, and roll it out to sufficient size to cover 
an apple, roll the crust around the apple and make into a ball. Dip a clean cloth into 
a pot of boiling water and shake flour over it. Tie each dumpling separately and 
drop it into the boiling water. If the crust is sufficiently light and the apples not 
too large, half an hour will be long enough to boil them ; but if very large, the 
apples will require nearly an hour. Serve with fresh butter and sugar, or the butter 
and sugar may be melted together, making a sauce, with a little essence of lemon 
added, to flavor. 

Currant Dumplings. 

Take half a pound of beef-suet and chop fine; put in a basin with four table- 
spoonfuls of flour, one pound of breadcrumbs, half a pound of sugar, and half a pound 
of cleaned currants. Mix all these well together, and stir in three-quarters of a pint 
of milk. Dip the center of a pudding-cloth into boiling water, wring it out, dredge a 
little flour over, and spread the floured cloth over the top of a basin, pour the dump- 
ling into it, tie the cloth tightly with a piece of strong twine, and put the dumpling 
into a large saucepan of boiling water; add to the water half a tablespoonful of salt, 
and boil fast for three hours, being careful not to allow the boil to slacken; should 
the water waste much, replenish it from a kettle kept boiling for the purpose. When 
the dumpling is done, remove with care from the cloth, and turn onto a hot dish. 

Fruit Dumplings. 

Roll out sufficient suet-crust to make eight dumplings, cut it into rounds four 
inches in diameter, fill each one separately with different kinds of fruits, put on the 
top of each a little mixture made with a tablespoonful of sifted breadcrumbs mixed 
with an egg, sweetened with sugar and flavored with grated lemon peel; roll up to form 
balls, tie each one separately in a cloth, and boil for forty-five minutes. When done, 
turn it out, pour over a wine sauce, and serve. 

Lemon Dumplings. 

Mince one-half pound of beef-suet very fine, then mix with it one-half pound 
of grated breadcrumbs, one-fourth pound of sugar, and the grated peel of one lemon; 
stir all together well with two beaten eggs. Form the preparation into dumplings, 
and boil them, tied in cloths, for three-quarters of an hour. 

Baked Peach Dumplings. 

Mix one teaspoonful each of cream of tartar and bicarbonate of soda with one 
quart of flour; add a little salt, sift them together, and make into a paste, with a little 



618 HOT DESSERTS. 

milk and water. Sprinkle a little flour on the table, and roll the paste out several 
times, putting little pieces of lard on it to the amount of six ounces. Roll out thin 
the last time, and cut it into rounds with a biscuit-cutter. Put two or three pieces of 
canned peaches on each round, one teaspoonful of butter, and one tablespoonful of 
fine sugar. Draw the edges firmly together and place the dumplings on a large 
deep baking-dish, put them in a hot oven and bake quickly. When done, place them 
on a hot dish, sprinkle a little powdered sugar over, and serve. 



Pear Dumplings. 



Make a good pastry, and cut it in pieces large enougn to enclose a medium- 
sized pear; peel some pears, leaving them whole, and keeping the stem intact, enclose 
them in pastry, brush them over with beaten egg, and bake them in a moderate oven, 
Serve them, either hot or cold, with powdered sugar or sauce. 

Egg Cheese Cakes. 

Boil half a dozen eggs hard and lay them in cold water for a few minutes, and 
then peel them. Rub them, with six ounces of butter, through a fine wire-sieve, and 
mix in four ounces of well-washed and dried currants, two crumbled, stale sponge 
cakes, one teacupful of moist sugar, and a small quantity of grated nutmeg, moisten- 
ing with the beaten yolks of two or three eggs and three-quarters of a wineglassful 
of brandy. Buttei some small pattypans, line them with puff paste, trim, fill them 
with the mixture and bake in a quick oven. When cooked, t'irn them out of the 
pans, and serve either hot or cold. 

Eggs, Duchess Style. 

Pour into a saucepan with half a pint of water, four ounces of powdered sugar, a 
little lemon peel and a small stick of cinnamon, adding half a teaspoonful of orange- 
flower water and mix together. Beat the yolks of twelve eggs with one pint of milk 
or cream; add this to the syrup with a very little salt; transfer the whole to a bak- 
ing-dish, place it on a hot stove, and cook the contents for ten minutes, stirring 
briskly. When it forms a cream, stir in the juice of a lemon, remove the dish from 
the fire, place it on another dish, and serve. 

Egg Snow with Coffee Cream. 

Whip the whites of five eggs to a firm froth and mix in five tablespoonfuls of 
caster sugar and one tablespoonful of coffee extract. Put in a stewpan one quart of 
milk, add three tablespoonfuls of sugar and boil; then add the beaten whites, one 
tablespoonful at a time, and stand the pan at the side of the fire. When the whites 
are done, take them out, drain and let cool. Put the yolks of six eggs, beaten up 



HOT DESSERTS. 619 

with one teacupful of the sweetened milk in which the whites were cooked, into a 
stewpan, and stir over the fire until thick, but without boiling; strain, and when cool, 
mix in one tablespoonful more of the extract. Arrange the poached whites in a circle 
on a dish, pour the coffee-cream over, and serve. 



Eggs, Turkish Style. 



Blanch and pound four ounces of pistachio nuts in a mortar, adding occasionally 
a few drops of milk to keep them from oiling, and put them into a lined saucepan 
with one dessertspoonful of ground rice and the yolks of eight eggs, adding also 
half a pound of sugar and a piece of stick cinnamon; beat all until well mixed and 
pour in gradually one quart of cream and stir over the fire until thickened. Pour 
some syrup into a flat stewpan, and break carefully one dozen new-laid eggs into it, 
to poach. Take the cinnamon out of the mixture, pour it on a dish, place the poached 
eggs around it, garnish with macaroons soaked in brandy, and serve very hot. 



Apricot Flawn. 



Butter a flawn circle and place on a baking-sheet, then line with puff paste or 
trimmings, and trim off level to the rim. Mask the bottom with a thin layer of 
powdered sugar, and upon this sugar arrange halves of peeled or canned apricots 
until the flawn is full. Ornament the rim with a strip of paste which has be?*: stamped, 
and sprinkle over with sugar, baking in a slack oven for thirty minutes. 



Cherry Flawn. 



Put three pounds of cherries into a preserving pan, with twelve ounces of sugar, 
and some water, and cook them until done. Strain the syrup into a saucepan, thicken 
it by reducing, put in about a quarter of the cherries, and reduce again until it falls 
in sheets from the spoon. Line with puff paste a flawn ring, put in the cherries that 
are not crystallized, and bake for forty-five minutes in a quick oven, spreading a piece 
of buttered paper over the top. Take away the paper, dampen the crust, and' dust 
with sugar; glaze this with a salamander, or in the oven, and pour over the crystal- 
lized cherries together with the syrup, and serve. 

Peach Flawn. 

Put eight not very ripe peaches in boiling water to loosen their skins, then drain 
and peel them; cut them into halves, remove the stones, and put them into a flat stew- 
pan. Mix some kirsch with syrup and pour it over the peaches. Peel and take out 
the stones of five or six small peaches, chop them and put them in a stewpan with a 
little more than one-half tumbler full of syrup; stir it over the fire till boiling, adding 
gradually a little potato flour. When thick pass it through a fine hair-sieve, add a 



620 HOT DESSERTS. 

wineglassful of kirsch and a stick of vanilla, and keep it hot in the bain-marie. 
Butter a flawn-mould, line it with short paste, put a buttered paper round, and bake 
it in a slack oven; when done, take the buttered paper out, spread some apricot 
marmalade all round the inside of the paste, take it out of the mould and stand it on 
a dish. Warm the peaches gradually, but do not boil them. Drain, and pile them 
inside the crust, brush them over with a paste-brush dipped in peach marmalade, 
arrange some preserved fruits of various colors over them, mix together in equal 
quantities some kirsch and syrup, and pour it over them. Put the peach puree in a 
sauceboat, and serve it with the peaches. 

Pear Flawn. 

Prepare a good paste with eight ounces of flour and some butter, roll it out into 
a round about ten inches in diameter, then gather it up about two inches all round 
the edges, which crimp and decorate with a wreath of paste leaves. The edges of 
the flawn should be moistened with a little water to make them stick. Peel some 
fine pears, cut them in halves lengthwise and put them in a preserving-pan with some 
sugar, the juice of one or two lemons and the thinly-pared and shred rind of one 
lemon. Cook the pears slowly till tender, and leave them till cold. Bind a strip of 
buttered paper round the flawn, fill it with the pears and their syrup and bake for 
three-fourths of an hour. When cooked take the paper off the flawn, glaze it over 
with apricot marmalade and serve it. 

Almond Custard Fritters. 

Beat up five eggs to each pound of flour and pour in by degrees some new milk, 
taking care to keep the mixture smooth. Stir this over a gentle stove for twenty 
minutes or so, until the custard is sufficiently thickened, when add a mixture of a 
quarter of a pound of sugar, one ounce of blanched and well-pounded almonds, six 
yolks of eggs, and a pinch or so of salt. This will then form a thick custard, which 
may be spread on a slightly buttered baking-sheet, and when cold it may be cut into 
pieces about two inches by one and a quarter inches. Dip these pieces in egg and 
breadcrumbs and fry in very hot fat until slightly colored, then drain by skimmer, 
dust with powdered sugar, and serve piled up on a folded napkin or dish-paper. 



Apple Fritters. 



Peel and core the apples and cut into slices about a third of an inch thick; dip 
in batter and fry for six minutes in boiling fat. Serve on a hot dish. The apples 
may be sprinkled with sugar and a little nutmeg and allowed to stand for an hour 
before frying; in the latter case sprinkle with the sugar when they are served. 



HOT DESSERTS. 621 

Apricot Fritters. 

Use a quarter of a pound of butter to each full pound of broche paste and set it 
for three hours to rise; then lay the paste on a slab, fold it over and roll out thick; 
fold again and place in a basin on ice. When quite firm roll it to an eighth of an 
inch thick and stamp out rounds with a cutter two inches in diameter; moisten the 
top edges of the rounds with a brush dipped in water and put a little apricot jam into 
the center of each; cover this with a second round of paste and press the two to- 
gether, taking care to have the edges stick closely. Prick with a skewer points on 
top one-sixth of an inch from the edge and fry the fritters in warm fat; drain and 
sprinkle fine sugar over them. Pile on a dish, and serve with ornamental sugar piping. 

Banana Fritters. 

Peel and cut into halves (if large) the bananas and soak in a mixture of rum and 
sugar. Then take out and dip them into a thin batter, plunge into a fryingpan of 
boiling lard, and fry to a light brown. Then take out, drain, drop into powdered 
sugar, and serve with sweet sauce or syrup poured over them. 

Fritters Bonne Femme. 

Put into a saucepan over the fire one ounce of butter to melt and mix in with it 
two ounces of sifted crushed loaf sugar, the grated rind of a lemon and a tumberful 
of water. When the liquor boils, sift in sufficient potato flour to make a stiff paste, 
and stir well until the mixture adheres to the saucepan. Turn the preparation into a 
basin, let it cool, but not get cold, and add the yolks of six eggs, singly, beating each 
one in for about four minutes before another is added. When all the yolks are 
worked in, spread the mixture on a dish, keeping it about one inch in thickness, and 
let it get cold. Take it up in small lumps about the size of walnuts, drop them into 
a fryingpan of boiling lard, and shake the pan well until the fritters are swollen and 
of a golden color. Take them out, drain, put them on a napkin, dust over with 'fine 
sugar, and serve. 

Cream Fritters. 

Put one teacupful of flour into a basin with an equal quantity of pounded maca- 
roons, a few dried orange flowers that have been browned in sugar, two ounces of 
finely-shredded candied lemon peel, and one or two small lumps of sugar. Beat the 
yolks of nine or ten eggs, mix them with one-half pint of milk and one-half pint of 
cream, and stir in gradually with the other ingredients, then add the beaten whites of 
three eggs. Turn the mixture into a saucepan, and stir it over the fire until it is thick 
and boiling. Pour it into a well-floured dish, dredge flour over it, and leave it until 
cold. Cut the paste into small pieces, roll them out round, place them in a fryingpan

with some hot butter, and fry until lightly browned. Drain the fritters, arrange them 
on a hot dish over which has been spread a folded napkin, and sprinkle over caster 
sugar. Serve while hot. 

French Fritters. 

Mix to a paste one pound of sifted flour with one pint of milk. Put a pint of 
milk in a saucepan and as soon as it boils, mix it with the paste of flour and milk; 
stir it over the fire until it boils, let it cook ten minutes, stirring constantly, pour it then 
into a good-sized bowl and leave it to cool. Beat the yolks and whites of ten eggs sepa- 
rately until very light (the whites should be a stiff froth), and stir them into the bat- 
ter when it is cool, a tablespoonful at a time, stirring in also a teaspoonful of salt. 
Take for each fritter nearly one tablespoonful of batter, drop them into boiling lard 
sufficient to cover and fry to a light brown. Lift them out with a skimmer, and serve 
hot with sweet sauce. 

v Fruit Fritters. 

Put into a basin two ounces of butter to warm, and mix four ounces of flour, one 
tablespoonful of brandy, a pinch of salt, sufficient water to make a creamy paste and 
work in the whites of two eggs beaten to a very stiff froth. Cut into pieces or quar- 
ters any kind of fruit, dip them in the batter and fry them in butter to a light golden 
brown; take them out when done, drain off all the fat, place on a dish, sprinkle over 
powdered sugar, and serve. The fruit should be quite ripe; if not, it should be par- 
boiled in syrup. 

Lemon Fritters. 

Beat up the yolks of six eggs, together with one-fourth pound of powdered white 
sugar. Mix with them when beaten quite light one saltspoonful of both nutmeg and 
cinnamon and one-fourth pint of cream; whip in lightly the whites of five eggs 
whisked to a froth, and then add about three-fourths of a pound of flour, working it 
in as quickly and as lightly as possible; when it should form a paste only just light 
enough to roll out. Take the rolling pin and roll out the paste to a thickness of 
three-fourths of an inch. With a tumbler or a cake-cutter, cut it into round pieces 
and fry in boiling lard. Lay them on a warm paper to drain. Serve hot with a 
sauce made of the whites of two eggs beaten as stiff as possible, together with one 
glass of wine, the grated peel of one lemon, one-half pound of powdered sugar and 
the strained juice of two lemons. 



Orange Fritters. 



Peel the oranges, cut them in halves, pick out the seeds, and, with a sharp knife, 
scrape off all the white pith; put them in a basin together with some fine sugar and 
three tablespoonfuls of brandy, and leave them for an hour or two, afterwards drain-

ing them on a sieve. Warm and beat two ounces of butter, beat also the yolks of 
two eggs, mix them together with the butter in three-fourths of a pound of flour, and 
stir in gradually with a wooden spoon sufficient tepid water to make the whole into a 
smooth batter. Whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff snow, and mix them lightly 
with the batter at the last moment. Put a large piece of lard or clarified fat into a flat 
stewpan, and place it over the fire until boiling; dip the pieces of orange into the 
batter, coating them well, and fry in the boiling fat until nicely browned. Then take 
them out, and put them on a sheet of kitchen-paper to drain. Spread a folded napkin 
or an ornamental dish-paper over a hot dish, place the fritters upon it, sprinkle sugar 
over them, and serve. 

Orange Custard Fritters. 

Put one pound of flour into a basin and stir it gradually, keeping it quite smooth, 
one quart of milk and five well-beaten eggs. Turn the batter into a saucepan, and 
stir it over a moderate fire for twenty minutes without letting it boil; then move it to 
the side of the fire, and mix in four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, one of finely- 
chopped orange peel, one-half saltspoonful of salt, and the well-beaten yolks of five 
eggs. Butter a baking-sheet, and, when the custard is well mixed, spread it over 
about one inch in thickness. When cold, cut it into equal-sized pieces, dip them in 
beaten egg and then in finely-grated breadcrumbs, and fry them in butter till a golden 
brown. Drain the fritters, dust some sugar over, put them on a folded napkin, or an 
ornamental dish-paper on a hot dish, and serve. 

Peach Fritters. 

Skin some ripe but firm peaches, cut them in halves, and take out the stones. 
Put the peaches in a bowl with sugar, and toss them about well, taking care not to 
break them. Put one pound of finely-sifted flour into a basin, and stir in one-half 
pint of water gradually with a wooden spoon. Beat the whites of three eggs till very 
stiff, mix them with the batter, and add one and one-fourth ounces of warmed butter. 
Put a lump of lard in a fryingpan, make it warm, but not too hot; dip each piece of 
peach separately in the batter, then fry them in the lard. When lightly browned, 
drain the peaches on a cloth, lay them on a baking-dish, the cut side downwards, sift 
some powdered sugar over, and glaze them under the salamander. Arrange the 
peaches in a pyramid on a folded napkin, placed on a hot dish, and serve. 

Pear Fritters. 

Take as many good cooking-pears as are required for the dish, cut them into 
slices lengthwise, cover with sugar, dip them in batter, plunge them into boiling oil, 
and fry a delicate brown. Take them out, drain, dust over again with sugar, place 
them on a napkin over a dish, and serve with sweet or wine sauce. 



624 HOT DESSERTS. 



Pineapple Fritters. 



Pare and grate a ripe pineapple, saving all of the juice; with this mix two cupfuls 
of flour, the yolk of one egg, a little salt and a tablespoonful of melted butter, with 
enough water to make a batter thick enough to hold a drop from the end of the spoon 
for a moment or two. Have ready before the fire a frying-kettle half full of fat, and 
when it commences to smoke, quickly stir the white of a beaten egg into the batter, 
and' then drop the batter by the tablespoonful into the hot fat; fry the fritters until 
they become of a golden brown color. Remove them from the fat with a skimmer, 
and lay them for a moment to brown on a piece of paper free from fat. They may 
then be arranged neatly on a fancy dish, and dusted over with powdered sugar and 
served. 

Portuguese Fritters. 

Cut six slices of bread half an inch thick, remove the crust and shape the crumb 
into rounds the size of the top of a tumbler, with which they can be marked out. Lay 
them in a dish with half a pint of milk, not allowing the milk to cover them; let them 
soak for half an hour, then lift them and drain for ten minutes on the side of the 
dish. Dip the slices of bread into well-beaten egg and fry them in butter to a rich 
brown. Drain, and serve with crushed loaf sugar. A little lemon juice may be 
squeezed over. 

Rhubarb Fritters. 

Cut some sticks of young rhubarb into pieces about an inch long, and boil them 
in water for ten minutes; then drain and place them in cold water. When quite cold, 
drain the pieces of rhubarb, lay them on a dish, strew finely-crushed sugar over, 
moisten with a few tablespoonfuls of brandy, and let them marinade for a couple of 
hours. Dip the pieces of rhubarb in some frying-batter, put them in boiling lard, and 
fry to a nice color. Drain on paper for a minute or two to absorb the fat, place them 
neatly on a dish that has been spread over with a folded napkin or a fancy paper, and 
serve. 

Rice Fritters. 

Put barely one cupful of rice in sufficient warm water to cover it well, and let it 
steep for three hours; then put it, with the water in which it was steeped, in a farina 
kettle and let it simmer until the rice is dry, then pour one pint of milk over it, and 
let it simmer again until the milk has all soaked into the rice; then stir in one ounce 
of butter, take it from the fire and let it cool. Beat up three eggs and three ounces 
of sugar together very lightly, and when the rice has cooled pretty well stir them in 
with grated nutmeg, salt to the taste, add one tablespoonful of flour. Cover a paste- 
board well with flour and make up the mixture with well-floured hands into flat 
cakes; place in the middle of each cake two or three raisins that have been 



HOT DESSERTS. 625 

"plumped " by soaking in boiling water for two or three minutes, roll the edges of 
the cake over the raisins so as to form a ball, flour the balls well, and fry them in 
boiling lard. Sprinkle them with powdered cinnamon and sugar, and serve on a 
napkin folded on a hot dish with sweetened cream. 

Souffles Fritters. 

Pour one breakfast cupful of water into a saucepan, boil it up, and add two ounces 
of butter; when it is dissolved, put in four ounces of flour in one lump, and not sprinkled, 
and work the paste with a spoon until it is smooth and cooked. Remove the pan from 
the fire, add six eggs, beating one well in before adding another, and working the paste 
well against the sides of the saucepan. Have ready a deep fryingpan with a good supply 
of boiling fat in it, and drop in the mixture in lumps about the size of an egg. As 
soon as they swell and become hollow and light, remove, drain and place them on a 
dish with a napkin spread over it, and serve. Only a few of them should be cooked 
at a time, as they require much room in which to swell. 



Strawberry Fritters. 



Mix one tablespoonful of salad oil with the grated peel of half a lemon and a 
little flour; when smooth add the whites of three well-whisked eggs and a little white 
wine. The mixture should be of the consistency of thick cream. Pick the tops off 
some large, ripe strawberries, and put the fruit in the prepared batter. Put a lump 
of butter into a deep fryingpan, and when it is boiling drop the batter, with the straw- 
berries, from a tablespoon into the fat. When nicely cooked remove the fritters 
carefully, drain them on a sieve or a colander, then arrange on a hot dish; sift some 
powdered sugar over, and serve. 

Vanilla Fritters. 

Pour into a saucepan one-half pint of water, two tablespoonfuls of sugar and four 
ounces of butter, and boil all together for a few minutes. Drop in five ounces of 
flour all at once, and stir the mixture over the fire until the paste is firm and smooth. 
Remove it from the fire, work in three eggs, one at a time, using a spoon, and beat 
the paste well against the side of the saucepan, Add one teaspoonful of vanilla ex- 
tract with the last egg. The more the paste is beaten the more the puffs will expand 
in the fryingpan. Then half-fill the saucepan with hot lard. Drop in pieces of the 
batter about the size of eggs, and watch them swell and expand in the hot lard and 
become hollow and light. Only four or five can be fried at a time, because they 
require considerable room. The fritters, being slightly sweet, will be apt to fry too 
dark if the lard be made too hot, and they may remain in it as long as five minutes 
before they begin to swell and run over. When done remove them, and serve hot. 



626 HOT DESSERTS. 

Lemon Patties. 

Put the grated crumbs of one stale loaf of bread in a basin, and pour over one- 
half pint of boiling milk. When cold mix in with the grated peel of two lemons, 
three well-beaten eggs, one-fourth pound of butter beaten to a cream, and sweeten to 
taste with powdered sugar. Butter some small cups, fill them with the mixture, and 
bake for twenty minutes or so in a moderate oven. Turn the patties on a hot dish, 
pour some wine-sauce over, and serve. 



Apricot Omelet. 



Put the yolks of six eggs and the whites of four into a basin ; sprinkle over them 
a small quantity of salt, and beat well. Pour into an omelet pan with a lump of but- 
ter, and as soon as it is set, turn it carefully out. Spread over as much apricot jam 
or marmalade as required, fold the omelet up, and place on a dish, sprinkle over 
powdered sugar, glaze in an oven with a salamander, and serve very hot. 

Celestine Omelet. 

Pound six macaroons, put them in a bowl, adding three tablespoonfuls of apple 
jelly and one tablespoonful of whipped cream, and mix it well with a spatula. Make 
a sweet omelet with twelve eggs, fold over the side opposite the pan, pour the mix- 
ture into the center, fold the other side over and turn the omelet out onto a hot dish. 
Sprinkle the top with three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, glaze the omelet, and 
decorate it with some ladyfingers cut into halves, also a teacupful of whipped cream. 



Jelly Omelet. 



Put one teaspoonful of butter into a fryingpan and place it over the fire. Beat 
the yolks of three eggs together with one teaspoonful of sugar and whisk the whites 
also to a stiff froth. When the butter is melted, mix the whites and yolks gently to- 
gether, and put them into the pan; as fast as the omelet cooks, lift the cooked part 
with a fork and throw it on one side of the pan, letting the uncooked part down upon 
the hot pan. When the omelet is cooked to the desired degree, place one table- 
spoonful of jelly in the middle, fold the omelet together and turn it out on a hot 
dish; sprinkle over powdered sugar, and serve. 

Kirsch Omelets. 

Make a sweet omelet with a dozen eggs; when it is done and glazed throw 
round a wineglassful of kirsch, and set the omelet on fire. Serve it while burning. 



HOT DESSERTS. 627 

Lemon Omelets. 

Mix one dessertspoonful of corn starch with one teaspoonful of flour and one- 
half teacupful of milk or cream; when quite smooth, stir in the yolks of four well- 
beaten eggs and one-half pint of boiling milk. Beat the whites of four eggs to a 
stiff froth and mix them with the above preparation. Butter four pudding plates, 
pour the mixture on them, dividing it equally and bake in a quick oven for ten minutes 
or until well set. When cooked, turn the omelets onto a hot dish, spread about one 
teaspoonful of lemon-honey over half of each, fold them over, sprinkle a little 
powdered sugar on the top, and serve while hot. 

Rum Omelet. 

Put half a dozen eggs and a small quantity of milk into a basin, add one tea- 
spoonful of finely-powdered loaf sugar and beat well, but do not make the omelet too 
light. Turn the mixture into a fryingpan with a small lump of butter and fry until 
done, rolling the omelet into shape as quickly as it begins to get stiff. Turn it out 
onto a dish, dredge over a little sugar, pour round one teacupful of rum, ignite it, 
and serve at once. 

' Omelet Souffle. 

An omelet souffle is one of the most delicious of hot sweets. It is not difficult 
to make when its principles are understood, and yet it is seldom well made by inex- 
perienced cooks. The true omelet souffle^ contains only eggs, sugar and the chosen 
flavoring, and a tin-lined copper souffle-pan or a thick enameled metal dish, which 
will quickly heat and remain hot for some time after being taken from the oven, is 
required for cooking it. Spread the pan with cold butter and see that the oven is 
quite hot before the omelet is made. Put the yolks of three eggs, six heaped table- 
spoonfuls of powdered loaf sugar and one teaspoonful of any flavoring essence or 
cordial into a quart bowl and beat them to a stiff cream; then beat the whites of the 
eggs to a stiff froth and quickly and lightly add the yolks and sugar. This part of 
the operation requires a quick, deft hand. The yolks should be poured on the center 
of the whites, then cut down through, rather beaten or stirred, by holding the spoon 
in the right hand with the bowl outward and cutting down into the whites with its 
edge an inward and upward turn will bring the spoon out again with its edge on top 
of the whites. Repeat this cutting-down and turning motion rapidly and lightly until 
the omelet is mixed, then as rapidly and lightly put the omelet into the pan in which 
it is to be baked, dust it over with powdered sugar, place it in the oven and bake 
until it is delicately browned (it will take about ten minutes if the oven is moderately 
hot). Do not begin to make the souffle until about twenty minutes before it is 
needed. It must not be allowed to stand after it is done, but must be sent to the 



628 HOT DESSERTS. 

table as soon as taken from the oven, slipping the souffle-pan on a hot dish covered 
with a folded napkin. 

Orange Meringue. 

Thoroughly wash and pick over one-half pound of the best rice, put it into a 
saucepan with plenty of water and place it over the fire. When the water boils drain 
it off the rice and pour in its place a quart of milk, add four ounces of crushed loaf 
sugar and the thinly-pared rind of one lemon and stew the rice slowly over a mod- 
erate fire until almost dry. Peel the rind off six oranges and put it into a saucepan 
with some thick syrup made with loaf sugar and a small quantity of water, cover and 
steep for twenty minutes over a slow fire. Trim off all the white pith of the oranges 
and remove their seeds by coring them like apples. When the rice has cooled, mix 
with it the beaten yolks of three eggs, put a layer of the rice on a flat dish, pile the 
remainder up to form a wall, place the oranges in the center and strain the syrup 
over. Whisk the whites of three eggs to a stiff snow with two tablespoonfuls of pow- 
dered sugar and spread it over the oranges, dust a small quantity of sugar over the 
whole and bake for twenty minutes in a moderate oven. Serve on the same dish. 



Orange Puffs. 



Grate the rind of three oranges and strain their juice, put the rinds into a mortar 
with one pound of sugar and about three ounces of butter and pound them into a 
smooth paste, then mix in the strained juice. Roll the paste out on a marble slab 
and cut into rounds with a tin cutter. Lay them a short distance from each other on 
baking sheets over which has been spread a sheet of white paper and bake in a rather 
slow oven. When done pile the puffs on a dish over which has been spread a folded 
napkin or an ornamental dish-paper, dust them over, with sugar, and serve. 

-x\ Pancakes. 

Mix two teaspoonfuls of flour with a little salt. Beat the yolks of four eggs and 
the whites of two, a44-a-few~dfop6-of o^raftge^flowcr wator, and then stir this in with 
the flour. Butter a small omelet pan, and when hot, pour in a small quantity of the 
batter, bake until brown, then turn and brown the other side. Roll up the pancake, 
put it on a hot dish, and keep near the fire till all are made. Arrange them on an 
ornamental dish-paper on a hot dish, sprinkle a little sugar over, and serve. 

Apple Pancakes. 

Take ordinary pancake batter in which a little yeast has been mixed, and allow 
it to rise. Break four eggs into a large bowl, beat well and add a teaspoonful of 
yeast and salt and a wineglassful of brandy, with a little powdered cinnamon or grated 
nutmeg. In a smaller basin, mix some flour and milk in a way as to form the con- 



HOT DESSERTS. 629 

sistency ot batter, and when it is worked smooth, stir into the large bowl with the 
other ingredients, Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place to work. Prepare a 
few apples by peeling, coring and mincing. With each quantity taken for a pancake, 
stir in a little of the minced apple. If too much of the apple is added the pancakes 
are liable to break, unless made extra thick. They should be sent hot to the table, 
accompanied by pounded sugar and oranges or lemons, cut in halves for squeezing 
over them. 



Pancakes, Casino Style. 



Rub fifteen lumps of sugar on two whole orange peels; also rub five pieces of 
sugar on two vanilla sticks; take one wineglass of cura^oa and a pony of brandy, 
together with half a pound of fresh butter and mix the whole together until the sugar is 
dissolved, and the mass forms a paste. After having your pancakes prepared as 
shown for plain pancake, take a chafing-dish and use for each pancake one table- 
spoonful of the above preparation. Place the preparation in the chafing-dish and 
when it is hot, put one pancake into it, and leave it there for about a minute, and turn 
your pancake over for the same operation as before; keep on doing the same thing 
for every pancake. It is proper to do this at the table as soon as the pancake is done, 
and serve it to your guest. 

Currant Pancakes. 

Stir in one-fourth pound of washed and dried grocer s currants to every pint of 
any plain pancake batter. Serve with hot butter, lemons and sugar. 



Gooseberry Pancakes. 



Put a lump of butter into a fryingpan; when it is melted, put in one quart of 
gooseberries previously snipped, and fry gently until tender; then take them out and 
mash them in a saucepan. Beat the yolks of six eggs, and whip three whites to a 
stiff froth; mix them with a teacupful of cream and finely-grated stale breadcrumbs, 
and a breakfast cupful of flour, pour them in the saucepan with the gooseberries, add 
sugar to taste, and stir over the fire until thick. Melt some butter in a fryingpan, 
and fry the preparation like pancakes. Put them on a hot dish, sift powdered sugar 
over, and serve. 

New England Pancakes 

Stir slowly into one pint of cream five tablespoonfuls of sifted flour. Beat up 
the yolks of seven new-laid eggs and the whites of four, season these with one tea- 
spoonful of salt, and stir them into the flour, working all together thoroughly. Heat 
very hot in a fryingpan one tablespoonful of fresh butter; pour in a thin layer of the 
batter, and turn when set. Serve these piled one on another, with sugar and powdered 
cinnamon over each. 



630 HOT DESSERTS. 

Rice Pancakes. 

Wash one-half pound of rice, put it into a saucepan with some water, and boil it 
to a jelly, adding more water when required. When cooked, leave it until cold; then 
mix with it one pint of cream, eight or nine eggs, a pinch of salt, and a small quantity 
of grated nutmeg. Warm one-half pound of butter, then stir it in with the other 
ingredients, adding as much flour as will make a thick batter. Fry the pancakes as 
usual, using as little butter as possible. Serve them either plain, or with jam or 
preserves. 



Pancakes with Apricot Jam. 



Put one-half pound of flour into a basin with a tablespoonful of fine sugar and a 
little salt, break in five eggs, and mix all well together. Add one-fourth pound of 
melted butter, and one and one-fourth pints of milk. Cut a piece of bread round 
one-fourth inch thick and four and one-half inches in diameter, sift sugar over, and 
glaze in the oven. Three fryingpans should be used when a large number of cakes 
are made, so that they may be done more quickly. Stand the pans on the fire with a 
small piece of butter in each, and, when it is melted, put two tablespoonfuls of batter 
in each. When one side of the pancake is browned, turn it on the glazed piece of 
bread, coat the top with apricot jam, put another one over this, and so on, till all are 
done. Do not coat the top one with jam, but sprinkle with powdered sugar, glaze it 
under a salamander, and serve. 

Pancakes with Macaroons. 

Put two ounces of bitter macaroons and one ounce of dried orange flowers into a 
mortar, and pound them very fine. Turn this into a large bowl, add one-fourth 
pound of finely-powdered white sugar and two ounces of dried and sifted flour, and 
mix all well together; then stir into them the beaten yolks of ten eggs; add a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and one quart of cream. Make a fryingpan hot over the fire, put a 
lump of butter into it, and when that is quite hot fry as much of the batter as will 
cover the bottom of the pan; when slightly browned on one side, turn it carefully and 
brown the other side. Lay it on a hot tin plate, spread over a thin layer of apricot 
marmalade, and on that sprinkle crushed macaroons. Roll the pancake up rather 
tight and proceed with the next one, which should, with some more butter, have been 
put in the fryingpan as soon as the first one was taken out. When all the pancakes 
are done, cut them about three inches long, glaze them, and serve hot; or they may 
be served quite plain. 

Baked Pears. 

Peel, cut in halves, and core twelve large pears, put them into a pan with two 
dozen cloves, one pound of sugar, and nearly enough water to cover them. Bake 



HOT DESSERTS. 631

a slow fire and let them stew gently. Grate a little lemon peel over them and add 
more sugar if required. 

Adelaide Pudding. 

Put the whites of three and the yolks of six eggs into a bowl and beat 
thoroughly; then place a pint of water and nine ounces of sugar in a saucepan and 
boil; when the scum rises, pour it over the eggs, and add the grated rind and the 
juice of a lemon, and whip the whole well together for about twenty minutes. 
Dredge in slowly about eight ounces of flour, and when thoroughly mixed, pour it 
into a well-buttered tin or mould, set it in a slack oven, and bake it for twenty 
minutes, then turn it out onto a dish, pour around a little wine sauce, and serve. 

Albemarle Pudding. 

Partially warm four ounces of butter, and beat it until it becomes frothy, then 
mix in four ounces of sugar, and the grated rind of one lemon. Whip separately the 
whites and the yolks of three eggs, and mix all together, sifting in, a little at a time, 
three-quarters of a pound of flour, and continue beating the whole until it is quite 
smooth. Butter a pudding-basin and ornament it with raisins, cover the top with a 
sheet of buttered paper, and stand it in a saucepan, with boiling water to about three 
parts its height, and steam for an hour and a half; when thoroughly cooked, turn the 
pudding out of the mould onto a dish, and serve. 

Almond Pudding. 

Put some butter in a dish to warm. Then beat the yolks of a number of eggs 
with the whites in a basin, and add gradually a little sifted crushed loaf-sugar, then 
the butter and half a pound of sweet almonds, blanched and pounded, together with 
some sifted breadcrumbs. Turn the mixture into a well-buttered saucepan or mould, 
in layers alternately with apricot jam ; tie the mould over with a wet cloth, and boil 
the pudding in a saucepan of water for an hour and a half. Turn it out onto a dish, 
pour sweet sauce around, and serve. 

Almond and Rice Pudding,

almond stuck into it, and serve. 



632 HOT DESSERTS. 

Apple and Almond Pudding. 

Peel and core some cooking apples, put them in a saucepan with a little water, 
and cook to a pulp. Put this at the bottom of a buttered basin or mould, and let it 
cool. Put five ounces of blanched almonds into a mortar with an equal weight of 
crushed loaf-sugar, pounding well and mixing in the yolks of seven eggs, the strained 
juice and grated rind of a lemon and a little flour to thicken it. When these are well 
mixed, add the whites of the seven eggs beaten to a froth, turn the whole into the 
basin or mould over the apples, place in a moderate oven and bake for about half an 
hour, when the pudding should be of a light brown. Take out when done and turn it 
onto a dish, serving with sweet sauce. 

Apple Custard Pudding. 

Stew some good large cooking-apples (pared, cored and minced) in a little 
water ; when done, rub through a coarse sieve and sweeten. Make a good custard of 
milk, eggs and powdered sugar, with a little lemon flavoring. Pour the apples into a 
pudding-dish and the custard mixture on top of the apples, and put in a slow oven to 
bake about half an hour until done. 

Apricot Pudding. 

Take the desired quantity of apricots, divide them and remove the stones. Place 
the halves in a stewpan over a stove with a little sugar. Pour over a little water 
and shake well, and when about half-cooked, pour them into a pudding-basin which 
has been previously buttered and lined with a good suet paste. Cover the top with 
some of the paste, tie over with a pudding-cloth, plunge into boiling water, and boil 
for two hours. Remove from the saucepan, untie the cloth, turn out on a dish, and 
serve. 

Bird's-Nest Pudding. 

Peel and core eight apples, but do not break them. Arrange them in a good- 
sized pudding-dish, and fill the places where the cores were with sugar. Then, with 
one and one-half pints of milk, three ounces of flour, and four or five eggs, make a 
batter; pour this over the apples, and bake until the fruit is done. For the sauce, 
beat one-fourth pound of butter until very light, add one-half pound of powdered 
white sugar, and one-fourth of a pint of cream. Stand the bowl containing the mix- 
ture in a basin of hot water, and stir until all is creamy. Two minutes should be 
sufficient. Serve in a sauceboat. 

Biscuit Pudding.

loaf-sugar and a tablespoonful of brandy, together with four well-beaten eggs; pour 
this mixture into a buttered dish or basin, tie over with a cloth, and place in a sauce- 
pan of water, and boil it for twenty minutes. When done, turn out onto a dish, pour 
over a little wine sauce, and serve. 

Bombay Pudding. 

Beat three whole eggs with one pint of milk, sweeten to taste with loaf-sugar, 
pour them into a lined saucepan, and stir over a slow fire until thickened, but not 
boiling. Move the saucepan to the edge of the fire, and stir in one wineglassful of 
brandy, a small piece of butter, and a little grated nutmeg, then grate some cocoanut 
and add it to the mixture. Butter a shallow dish, line it with a good puff-paste, and 
spread the cocoanut mixture over it. Place the pudding in a brisk oven, and bake 
until lightly brown. Serve the pudding either hot or cold. 

Boston Pudding. 

Peel and remove the cores from two pounds of cooking-apples and cut them 
into small pieces; put them in a stewpan with a small piece of stick cinnamon, two 
or three cloves, and the thinly-pared rind of a large lemon; moisten with a small 
quantity of water, and stew gently until reduced to a pulp. When cooked sweeten 
the apples to taste with moist sugar, and rub them through a fine sieve. Beat the 
yolks of three eggs, and the whites of one with three ounces of warmed butter, a 
small quantity of grated nutmeg and grated lemon-peel and strained juice of half a 
lemon; beat the mixture thoroughly. Butter and line the edges of a pie-dish with 
puff-paste, pour in the mixture and bake in a moderate oven. When cooked, serve 
either hot or cold.

meg and stir over the fire until thick. Pour the above mixture slowly into the pie- 
dish with the crumbs, put the pudding in a moderate oven and bake it for half an 
hour. When done, serve either hot or cold. 

Tapioca Custard Pudding. 

Take one breakfast cupful of tapioca, pour over it just enough water to cover, 
and allow it to steep all night. Beat the yolks of five eggs lightly. Pour one quart 
of milk into a saucepan over the fire, and when warm stir in the beaten yolks, and 
one-half pound of powdered white sugar. Sprinkle a very little salt over the soaked 
tapioca, remove the milk and eggs from the fire before they boil, and beat them into 
it. Whisk the whites of five eggs to a firm froth, stir them lightly and quickly into 
the pudding, pour it into a buttered pudding-basin, stand it in a pan of boiling water, 
and bake in a moderate oven with a dish turned down over it to cover it until the 
custard thickens; then remove it from the oven, take the cover off, lift it out of the 
hot water, and stand it in the hot part of the oven to brown. It may be served either 
hot or cold. 

Vanilla Pudding. 

Place a vanilla bean in a mortar together with one-half pound of sugar, pound 
well together, then sift. Separate the yolks from the whites of nine eggs, beat the 
yolks well, stir them in with one quart of cream, and then mix in the vanilla sugar. 
Whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff broth, and mix them in lightly with the other 
ingredients. Butter the interior of a pudding-mould, pour in the mixture, and cover 
with a sheet of paper. Stand the mould in a saucepan of boiling water, and steam 
the pudding for a little less than an hour. In the meantime prepare the following 
sauce for the pudding: Pour one breakfast cupful of either canned or fresh pineapple 
juice into a small lined saucepan with the juice of one lemon. Put the pan over the 
fire until the contents are boiling, then pour it gradually over one tablespoonful of 
arrowroot, stirring it at the same time; return the sauce to the saucepan, and stir it 
over the fire until thickened. When cooked turn the pudding out of the mould onto 
a hot dish, strain the juice over it, and serve. Care must be taken that the water 
does not enter into the top of the mould, while the pudding is cooking, or it will be 
spoiled.

it on the mixture in the dish. 

Coffee Souffle. 

(1) In a sugar boiler put one-half pound of green coffee, roast without brown- 
ing it, and soak in it one quart of boiling milk for about an hour. Stir one breakfast 
cupful of flour, one teaspoonful of vanilla-sugar and caster-sugar and one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, together with the prepared milk; pour it into a saucepan and stir it over 
the fire until boiling. Remove the mixture from the fire, put in the yolks of six 
eggs with the whites beaten very firm, fill some paper cases with the mixture, and 
bake. When done, sprinkle caster-sugar over the top, and serve immediately.

in the rind of a small lemon, and stir the mixture over the fire until it is thick. Re- 
move the saucepan, stir in gradually the beaten yolks of three eggs, beat the whites 
of four eggs to a stiff froth, then mix them lightly with the rest. Butter a pudding 
mould, tie a strip of paper round the outside to prevent the souffle coming over it as 
it rises, pour the preparation into the mould, stand it in a saucepan with boiling water 
to half its height, and allow it to simmer by the side of the fire until sufficiently firm 
to turn out. Make a sauce as follows: Boil two tablespoonfuls of crushed loaf sugar 
in one teacupful of cold water for ten minutes, then put in the strained juice of a 
lemon. Mix one teaspoonful of flour with one wineglassful of sherry, mix it with the 
syrup and stir it over the fire until thickened. Turn the pudding out onto a dish,

spoonfuls of rosewater and put it over the fire in a saucepan with a little thinly-pa'red 
orange peel and a little cinnamon; stir till it boils, and remove. Strain and add suffi- 
cient powdered white sugar to sweeten it. Let it stand till cold and then mix with 
it two tablespoonfuls of marmalade and six eggs beaten well with a wineglassful of 
brandy. Pour it onto a well-buttered mould, stand it in a saucepan of boiling water, 
and let it boil for an hour and a quarter without any cover over it. 



HOT DESSERTS. 651 

Pistachio Souffles. 

Four ounces of blanched pistachios should be cut, half of them into strips and 
the remainder chopped fine. Whip up the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth and 
mix it with the strips of pistachios and half a pound of sugar; place this mixture in 
small paper cases about three-quarters of an inch in width and height, dusting over 
with a little sugar, and moisten it a little, sprinkle over the chopped pistachios, bak- 
ing in a slack oven until a brown color is attained; then turn it out onto a dish, and 
serve. 



Strawberry Souffle. 



Pick the stems from three pounds of ripe strawberries, put these in a saucepan 
with the grated peel of half a lemon and one teacupful of crushed loaf sugar, and 
allow to simmer gently by the side of the fire. Beat the yolks of four eggs in one 
pint of milk, sweeten to taste with sugar, stand the basin in a saucepan containing 
hot water, and stir the custard mixture over the fire till it is thick. Put the straw- 
berries round a glass dish, forming a high wall and leaving a hollow in the center, 
which fill with custard; whisk the white of four eggs to a firm froth, pour them over 
the souffle, cover with powdered sugar, and serve. 

Vanilla Souffle. 

Beat together the yolks of three eggs and one teacupful each of flour and sugar. 
When well incorporated stir in gradually one pint of fresh milk, and strain it through 
a fine hair-sieve into a saucepan. Put about one ounce of butter, a piece of stick of 
vanilla, and a little salt in with the other ingredients, and stir them over a very slow 
fire until thick ; then move it to the side and continue stirring for a few minutes 
longer. Remove the vanilla from the mixture, allow it to cool a little, then mix with 
it the beaten yolks of five eggs, and a small lump of butter, and last of all the well- 
whisked whites of half a dozen eggs. Make some small paper cases in the shape of 
a long square, butter them and nearly fill them with the mixture, which should be 
sufficient in quantity to fill eight cases. Place the souffles in a slow oven, and bake 
them for eighteen minutes. Serve the moment they are done. 

Pear Timbale with Raisins. 

Butter a timbale-mould and line it with short paste. Peel, core and mince twelve 
pears, put them in a preserving-pan with a piece of butter, and cook them over a slow 
fire till half done. Put in with the pears a quarter of a stick of vanilla, two break- 
fast cupfuls of picked Smyrna raisins, previously softened in warm water, three table- 
spoonfuls of apricot marmalade, and a small quantity of sugar. When done leave the 
pears to cool. Dilute a little apricot marmalade with kircsh. Fill the lined mould

with the pears, put a flat of the same paste over it and bake it in a slack oven for 
three-fourths of an hour. When done, turn the timbales on a dish, sprinkle over 
some chopped pistachios, pour over the apricot sauce, and serve. 

Vol-au-Vents Chantilly. 

Take one pound of puff-paste, give it six and a half turns, roll it out to about 
one-eighth of an inch in thickness, and with a fluted cutter cut out about two and 
one-half dozen pieces. Form them into rings by cutting out the centers with a 
cutter about one and one-fourth inch in diameter. With the trimmings of the paste 
prepare an equal number of rings the same size, brush them over with egg, put one 
of the other rings on top of each, press them together so they will adhere, place 
them on a baking-sheet, brush them over with egg, put them into a brisk oven, and 
bake. When nearly done, sprinkle them over with sugar, and stand them in the oven 
to glaze and finish cooking. When done, remove them and fill them with any kind of 
cream desired. 

Vol-au-Vents with Strawberries. 

Prepare one pound of puff-paste, giving it six and a half turns; roll it out to 
about one-eighth of an inch in thickness, and with a fluted cutter about two inches in 
diameter cut about thirty rounds. Then cut out the center of these with a cutter 
one and one-fourth inches in diameter. Work up the balance of the paste and with it 
form an equal number of rings cut out in the same manner. Place them on top 
of one another. Have ready four ounces of sugar boiled to the caramel degree 
(see Sugar Boiling), dip the tops of the vol-au- vents into it, and afterward into 
coarsely-sifted loaf-sugar, and bake in a brisk oven. Put three ounces more of sugar 
into the saucepan with the caramel, reduce it again to the caramel degree, then add 
about one teacupful of the strained juice of strawberries. Fill the vol-au-vent cases 
with whole strawberries, cover with the syrup, and serve. 



Cold Desserts. 

Almond Bavarois. 

Put a small quantity of gelatine into a basin with a little milk and soak it for two 
hours. Put sufficient cream into a basin, and whip until there is but one-third of the 
amount left, the remainder being in a stiff froth. Put the blanched sweet almonds 
into a mortar, pound them well, mix in the unwhipped cream, and add two or three 
eggs beaten up with a little sugar. Put the whole into a saucepan and stir it over the 
fire until the preparation commences to thicken. Add the gelatine, remove the pan 
from the fire, pour the whole through a sieve into a basin, and put in a very small 
amount of essence of almonds. Whisk well until the mixture thickens, then add the 
whipped cream, stir well, and pour the cream into moulds packed on ice. When it is 
set and firm, turn it out onto a dish, and serve. Whipped cream should accompany it. 

Apple Bavarois. 

Pare and cut into quarters some sweet apples and place in a preserving-pan; add 
the juice of some lemons, a little sherry, some sugar and an ounce of isinglass dis- 
solved in a little warm water and strained. Place over a moderate fire, stirring the 
contents occasionally with a wooden spoon. Stew until the apples are quite tender, 
and then rub through a tammy-sieve into a basin. Place this upon ice and stir slowly 
until at the point of setting, when some whipped cream must be stirred in, and the 
whole poured into a mould. Turn out when set, and serve. A wineglass of maraschino 
or noyeau adds considerably to the richness of the flavor. 



Chocolate Bavarois. 

Take one pint of cream and whip it to a stiff froth, soak one ounce of gelatine in 
one ounce of milk, scrape one ounce of chocolate to a powder, add two tablespoonfuls 
of powdered sugar, put in a small saucepan with one tablespoonful of boiling water, 
place on the fire and stir until it is quite smooth and glossy. Boil another 
cupful of milk, stir the chocolate in, add the gelatine; then pass through a strainer in a 
basin and add more sugar so that, with the two tablespoonfuls used before, the quantity 
will be half a pound altogether. Put the basin in ice and beat the mixture until it is 
thick; then pour in the cream, mix and put in the mould. When hard, invert onto a 
dish and pour more whipped cream over it.

654 COLD DESSERTS. 

Fruit Bavarois with Cream. 

Place on ice a plain charlotte mould and decorate it inside with any small fruit 
in season at the time, which dip into liquid jelly in order to make them adhere to the 
mould. Pour over a little more of the jelly so as to cover, but take care not to dis- 
turb the pieces of fruit. When the jelly is set, insert in the mould a smaller one, 
about an inch and a half less in diameter. Fill the space between the moulds with 
more of the jelly and fruit, and when these have set and are quite firm, remove the 
inner mould by pouring warm water on it. Fill the center of the large mould with 
strawberry or any other kind of cream, and let it remain until set. Turn the bavarois 
out of the mold onto a dish, loosening it by dampening the mould with a hot cloth. 
Decorate the top with diamond-shaped pieces of angelica about an inch in length, 
and in the center of these pile a little whipped cream, sprinkle over with finely- 
shredded pistachio kernels, color a little more of the cream with a few drops of cochi- 
neal, take it up in small quantities and garnish the dish with it, and serve. 

Strawberry Bavarois. 

Take one quart of freshly-picked, thoroughly ripe strawberries, mash with four 
tablespoonfuls of finely-powdered white sugar and pass through a rather fine sieve. 
Put this puree into a china basin until wanted. Now dissolve one and one-half 
ounces of fine isinglass in a pan with a tumbler of warm water, add one-half pound of 
fine sugar, and when this is all dissolved add the juice of an orange and twenty drops 
or so of essence of lemon. Pass through a sieve and keep on stirring it as it gets 
cold, adding the puree of strawberries by degrees. Place it on the ice and as it 
thickens mix in four tablespoonfuls of whipped cream. Pour it into a large-sized 
dome-shaped mould previously packed in ice. Cut a slice of Genoa-cake one inch 
thick, the shape of the dish, and cover it smoothly with vanilla-flavored icing. Set 
this and turn out the bavarois onto an ice-cold dish, taking care to place it exactly in 
the center. Ornament with large strawberry and angelica leaves on the top, and 
place strawberries with angelica leaves round the base of the dome. 

Chocolate Blanc-Mange with Cream. 

Soak an ounce and a half of gelatine in half a pint of cold water for four hours. 
Warm one quart of milk, stir in the gelatine and half a pound of sugar; let it get hot 
and, when quite melted, strain; add three tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate, stir 
continually and boil for ten minutes. When nearly cold beat it with an egg-whisk 
for ten minutes; flavor to taste with vanilla and whisk until it begins to thicken. 
Then pour it into a cylinder-mould that has been wetted with cold water. Let it 
stand all night, then unmould and fill in the cavity with whipped cream. 



COLD DESSERTS. 655 

Citron Blanc-Mange. 

Blanch one pound of sweet almonds, place them in a large mortar and pound 
them to a paste; to this paste add by degrees four or five tumblerfuls of water, mixing 
with the pestle. When well mixed strain it through a cloth, squeezing it well to get 
all the milk of almonds from the paste. Divide this milk of almonds into two equal 
parts. Grate the rind of a lemon on a quantity of lump-sugar, and continue until six 
ounces of sugar have been used, dissolving this sugar in one-half of the milk of 
almonds. In the remaining half of the milk of almonds dissolve six ounces of plain 
plain lump-sugar. Put one and one-half ounces of isingslass to soak in just enough 
cold water to cover it. When the sugar is thoroughly melted, strain each half of the 
milk of almonds, and when it is quite dissolved place a mould in ice and pour in 
white blanc-mange to the depth of three-quarters of an inch; let that set, and then 
pour in the same quantity of the other half, which ought to be a clear yellow; allow 
that to set also, and then pour in some more white, and so proceed, pouring in alter- 
nately white and yellow until the mould is full; unmould to serve after it has set 
thoroughly on ice. 

Quince Blanc-Mange. 

Peel and core two pounds or so of quinces, put them into preserving-pans with 
one quart of water each, and keep them simmering gently until broken but not reduced 
to a pulp. Strain the liquor through a jelly-bag into a pan, and put in one ounce and a half 
of gelatine and twelve ounces of fine sugar. Stir the mixture gently over a brisk fire, 
and boil it until it leaves the spoon when drawn from the pan. Skim carefully, 
remove all the scum, then pour into a basin, and stir in with it one-half pint of thick 
cream until nearly cold, rinse the mould out with cold water, pour in the blanc-mange, 
and leave it until quite cold and set. It should be made with ripe quinces only. 
When ready to serve, turn the blanc-mange out of the mould onto a fancy dish. 

Strawberry Blanc-Mange. 

Pick the tops from one quart of ripe strawberries, place the fruit in a basin and 
crush it with a wooden spoon, sprinkling one-quarter of a pound of powdered sugar 
over it at the same time. Allow the strawberries to stand for a few hours. Put one- 
fourth pound of sugar and two ounces of isinglass in a lined saucepan with one pint 
of milk, and stir it over the fire until the isinglass is dissolved. Strain the milk 
through muslin, mix with it one and one-fourth pint of cream, and stir the whole 
until cold. Pour the cream and milk over the strawberries, beating them at the same 
time; then squeeze in the juice of a lemon gradually in order to prevent curdling. 
Turn the above mixture into an ornamental mould, pack it in ice, and leave it until 
set. Turn the blanc-mange out of the mould onto a fancy dish, and serve.

Carefully blanch about six ounces of sweet and two ounces of bitter almonds; 
place in a vessel and cover them with cold water, letting them soak for fully an hour; 
drain through a sieve and pound thoroughly in a mortar, adding gradually a very 
little cold water, and continue pounding for ten minutes. Then remove to a vessel, 
adding two gills of lukewarm water, and mix for two minutes with the spatula. Spread 
over another vessel a large napkin, pour above preparation in and lift the four corners, 
and squeeze the liquor through the napkin, and place the almond milk one side for 
future use Place in a saucepan a little cold water, three-quarters of an ounce of 
gelatine, a piece of vanilla bean two inches long and split in halves, add about four 
ounces of powdered sugar. Mix this well with the spatula for a couple of minutes, 
then put on the lid, and let the contents infuse for thirty minutes; place the pan upon 
a hot stove, stirring gently from the bottom, and let it boil gently for four or five 
minutes; take it from the fire and set one side for three minutes, then pour in the 
almond milk, and mix again for two minutes or so, using the spatula, and strain the 
whole mixture through a fine sieve into another vessel. Have a three-pint fluted 
blanc-mange mould in readiness, and put some broken ice at the bottom of a pail, 
place the mould upon the ice, arranging the ice around the sides of the mould until it 
is sunk into the ice up to the edge; stir the preparation for one minute, and then pour 
into the mould, cover the pail with a napkin, and leave it to become frozen. Then 
carefully remove the pail, wipe off the ice with a towel, and have ready a cold dessert- 
dish, with a folded napkin ovet it, and turn the blanc-mange onto this, decorate with 
candied cherries and angelica, and serve. 



Chantilly Charlotte. 



Line a dome-shaped mould with lady's-finger biscuits, arranging them artisti- 
cally according to taste; put into a basin one pint or more of thick cream, and whisk 
it with an egg-beater until it is formed into a stiff froth. For one pint of cream, add 
gradually four ounces of powdered sugar and one-half ounce of soaked gelatine. 
Flavor the cream with a few drops of essence of violets; pour it carefully into the 
mould with the biscuits, and pack the mould in salt and pounded ice for an hour or 
two. When it is ready to serve, turn the contents of the mould carefully out on a 
fancy dish, and serve. 

French Charlotte. 

Remove the center from an almond sponge-cake, leaving the bottom and sides 
about one inch in thickness. Place in a basin with some sherry about one-half pound 
of macaroons, and allow them to soak well. Whip to a stiff froth one pint of cream. 
Put the soaked macaroons at the bottom of a sponge-cake mould, then spread a thick 



COLD DESSERTS. 657 

layer of preserve over them and fill it up with the cream, piling it high in the center. 
Ornament the edge and middle with icing by squeezing it through a cornet. Stand 
the charlotte in a glass dish until required. 

Fruit Charlotte. 

Line a charlotte-mould with sweetened short paste, mask the paste all round the 
inside with paper, fill it with flour, and bake; when done take it out of the oven, turn 
out the flour, remove the paper, turn the paste out of the mould, spread a layer of 
apricot marmalade inside it and put it back into the mould. Prepare a coarse salpi- 
con with some preserved fruits and let them soak in maraschino for three hours. Boil 
a stick of vanilla and seven ounces of sugar with one pint of milk and beat in the 
yolks of seven eggs. Strain this cream and when it is cool freeze it in a freezer; 
when frozen mix in gradually three tablespoonfuls of maraschino and six tablespoon- 
fuls of whipped and sweetened cream. Drain the fruits and fill the charlotte-mould 
with alternate layers of the fruits and cream. Shut the mould, lute its junctures with 
paste and pack it in salted ice for two hours. When ready, turn it out onto a fancy 
dish, mask it all over with apricot marmalade, ornament the top with a variety of dif- 
ferent-colored preserved fruits, and serve. 

Orange Charlotte. 

Line a charlotte-mould with sections of oranges. Put one-third ounce of gela- 
tine into a basin with a little less than a teacupful of water, let it soak until soft, then 
pour over about the same quantity of boiling water and add eight ounces of sugar and 
the juice of a lemon. Pass it through a sieve into another basin and add the pulp 
and juice of sufficient oranges to make one-half pint of it; add a little of the grated 
rind of an orange and pack the basin in ice to cool. Beat the whites of three eggs 
to a stiff froth and when the orange mixture begins to thicken add them and beat 
until it is thick enough to drop from the whisk. Pour it into the mould, pack it in 
ice, and when set and firm pour it out onto a glass dish, garnish round with crystal- 
ized orange flowers, and serve. 

Raspberry Charlotte. 

Take two pounds of ripe raspberries, remove the hulls, see that there are no in- 
sects in the hollows of the berries, and have in readiness also one pound of dry bread- 
crumbs. Then butter a pudding dish and cover the bottom with a layer of the dry 
breadcrumbs; on the top of this place a layer of raspberries, sprinkle plenty of sugar 
over them, add another layer of breadcrumbs, then a layer of raspberries sprinkled 
with sugar, and so on until the dish is filled; let the last layer be breadcrumbs. On 
top of this last layer put bits of butter. Place a plate or cover over it and bake for 
about thirty minutes. Remove the plate or cover a few minutes before serving and 
let it brown. Serve cream with it.

Charlotte Russe. 

Thoroughly soak one ounce of gelatine in one teacupful of milk. Beat together 
the yolks of ten eggs and one-half pound of powdered sugar together, and place in a 
double-boiler with one breakfast cupful of milk; mix until the whole begins to thicken, 
then add the gelatine, and strain into a large tin basin. Place this in a pan of ice, 
and when it begins to cool add the whites of the eggs, well beaten, one tablespoonful 
of vanilla extract, half a tumblerful of sherry, and one pint of whipped cream. Stir 
well, and pour into the moulds that have been lined with sponge-cake, aud set them 
away to harden. With the quantities given two quart-moulds can be filled. The 
lining may be one piece of sponge-cake hollowed out, or strips of the same, or lady's 
fingers. If desired the wine may be omitted. Charlotte Russe may be filled with 
any kind of cream. 

Burnt Almond Charlotte Russe. 

I 1 ii i y-, 1 

Line a plain mould with finger biscuits as for other charlottes. Chop up fine a 
nurriber of the best almonds and brown them by boiling in an equal amount of sugar; 
cool them on a baking-sheet, and pound them thoroughly in a mortar, adding some 
cold milk; while stirring in a pan on the fire, press through a tammy cloth. Steep a 
small quantity of isinglass in a little tepid water. Put the almonds into a stewpan, 
with eight beaten eggs to each quarter of a pound of nuts used, and a little finely- 
powdered sugar, and stir over the fire until it thickens; pour into a kitchen basin, and 
stir in the solution of isinglass, strain and pack the basin in broken ice, and stir the 
mixture slowly until it begins to freeze. As soon as it begins to coagulate, pour it 
carefully into a biscuit-lined mould, and cover with a thin sheet of tin, with ice piled 
on it, leave it thus for an hour or so longer or till wanted, turn into a glass dish, and 
serve with crystallized fruits. 

Charlotte Russe with Coffee. 

Thoroughly clean and line eight small charlotte-russe moulds with lady's-finger 
cakes, cut in halves; and if they should be higher than the moulds, trim them off at 
the edge. Add to one pint of vanilla cream two tablespoonfuls of coffee essence; 
beat all together well for two minutes, and fill the moulds with the mixture. Turn 
them out onto eight dessert-plates, spread a little more cream on the top, and cover 
each with one macaroon. Dress the remainder of the cream around the plates, and 
serve. 

Chartreuse of Oranges. 

Two plain moulds will be required, one of which should be about one and one- 
half inches larger in diameter than the other. Make some orange jelly and pour a 
layer of it in the larger mould, then put in a layer of oranges divided into quarters, 



COLD DESSERTS. 659 

and freed of all skin and pips; pour over these another layer of jelly, and stand 
the mould on ice. When the jelly is quite firm, put in the smaller mould, placing it 
exactly in the center, so that the space all round will be the same. Next fill up the 
space between the moulds with quarters of oranges, prepared as above, and liquid 
orange jelly, and set the mould on ice. Dissolve one-half ounce of isinglass in a 
small quantity of milk, then mix it with three gills of cream. Sweeten it with orange 
syrup, adding this latter ingredient in very small quantities and whipping the cream 
well at the same time. When the jelly has set, pour warm water in the smaller mould 
to loosen it, then lift it out carefully, fill the h'ollow space with the whipped cream, 
and stand the whole on ice for an hour longer. When ready to serve, dip the large 
mould containing the chartreuse in warm water, then turn its contents quickly onto a 
dish. This dish can be made to look very pretty and effective if a little care and 
judgment be exercised in its manufacture ; the flavor is excellent 

Strawberry Chartreuse. 

Pick off the tops of two pounds of ripe strawberries, and cut them into halves 
lengthwise. Prepare one quart of calf's foot jelly, flavor it with lemon, and leave it 
until slightly cooled. Pour a thin layer of the jelly in the bottom of a large mould, 
and then arrange a layer of the strawberries on top, cover them with a little jelly and 
leave till set. When the jelly in the large mould is quite firm, stand a smaller mould 
inside. Fill the space between the moulds with strawberries, filling up the cavities 
with jelly, then set the mould on the ice. Dissolve one-half ounce of isinglass in a 
little water, then mix with it one-half pint of strawberry juice and sweeten to taste 
with powdered sugar. Whisk one pint of cream to a froth, stir it in by degrees with 
the strawberry juice. When the jelly has set, pour a little warm water in the smallest 
mould to loosen it, then take it carefully out of the large one. Fill the hollow with 
the cream, and leave the mould in ice till the cream has set. When ready to serve, 
dip the mould in tepid water, wipe it, and turn the chartreuse out onto a fancy dish. 

Sugared Chestnuts. 

Roast some chestnuts and peel off the skins. Have some reeds cut into pieces 
some three inches long, and put a chestnut on the point of each of these. Take a 
piece of butter about the size of a nut and rub with the hand on a piece of marble, 
and be sure to rub the butter all over it. Boil some sugar to caramel, and when it is 
at this degree take a wood splint, with a chestnut on the end of it, and dip them in 
the caramel. When all the chestnuts are done and are cold, take out the bits of 
osier, and wrap each chestnut in paper. 

Compote of Apples. 

Peel and core some apples, boil them in a light syrup with the rind of lemon 
pared very thin, and a few cloves. When done, remove the peel and cloves and allow 



660 COLD DESSERTS. 

the apples to get cold. Line a compote-case with tart paste, put a sheet of paper in 
next the paste and fill the center with flour; set in oven to bake. When done and 
cold, remove the flour and the paper; place boiled rice then in the center and pile 
the apples around in the shape of a pyramid; mask them over with diluted apricot 
jam and ornament the compote with preserved cherries and angelica cut up into 
various shapes, also a few shredded almonds. Care should b.e taken that the case 
suits the shape of the dish it is to be served in. Remove the case and ornament the 
pastry with icing. 

Compote of Cherries. 

Cut off the stems from one pound of cherries to about three-quarters of an inch 
in length. Then put one-half pound of sugar in a sugar-boiler and add two quarts 
of water. Boil for three minutes; then put in the cherries, place the cover on the 
boiler and boil for five minutes longer. Remove the cherries, put them on a strainer 
and let them drain; then place them on a compote-dish with the stalks sticking up. 
Reduce the syrup to 30 degrees, and after it is cool, pour it over the cherries, and serve. 



Take the brown skins off about fifty chestnuts and put in boiling water till the 
inner skin comes off easily; then put in a copper sugar-boiler, laying them flat on the 
bottom, cover with a syrup at 160 degrees Fahr. and let simmer for thirty minutes. 
When done, strain the syrup and reduce to 30 degrees Fahr.; before doing so, flavor 
with the rind of an orange. Put the chestnuts in a dish and strain the syrup over them. 



Cranberry Compote. 



Pick off the stems from about one quart of cranberries. Put three-fourths of a 
pound of crushed loaf-sugar in a saucepan with one and one-half pints of water and 
the rind of a lemon thinly pared; place the saucepan over a moderate fire and let 
the contents boil till reduced to a thick syrup. Put the cranberries in and stir them 
constantly over the fire with a wooden spoon for ten minutes. At the end of that 
time, remove the cranberries from the fire, allow them to become cold, then turn them 
into a compote dish, or any variety of fancy dish, dust caster-sugar over them, and 
serve. 



Compote of Red Currants. 



Put one pound of ripe red currants into a basin with half a pound of caster-sugar. 
Press the currants with a wooden spoon, and when the sugar has partly dissolved in 
the juice, pour the whole into a pan and boil up, and turn into a compote dish when 
cool. Leave it for two hours, when, if it has been properly prepared, it will set to a 
jelly and be ready for use. 



COLD DESSERTS. 661 

Compote of Figs. 

Put in a basin the required quantity of figs with the juice and peel of one or two 
lemons; pour over sufficient boiling water to cover and leave until cold. For every 
two pounds of fruit, put in a preserving-pan half a pound of granulated sugar and one 
pint of water, boil until the sugar is dissolved, then drain the figs and put them in the 
syrup with one thinly-sliced lemon without seeds, and simmer gently until tender. 
Leave the figs in the syrup until cold, then group them in the center of a glass dish, 
pour the syrup over, and serve. 

Compote of Fruits with Iced Champagne. 

Select two fine cooking-pears, peel, core and cut in quarters, and put them in a 
sugar-boiler with syrup at sixteen degrees and sufficient prepared cochineal to make 
the pears a good pink; then take two large cooking-apples, peel, core and cut in 
quarters and put them in a sugar-boiler with syrup at sixteen degrees, and cook some 
stoned greengages in the same way; when all the fruits are ready, put them on a 
wire-sieve to drain until cold. Pour half a bottle of champagne in a freezer, together 
with one teacupful of syrup at thirty degrees, and let it freeze. Arrange the cold 
fruit in a compote dish, pour over the frozen champagne and syrup, and serve. 

Compote of Greengages. 

Take about twenty large and perfectly sound greengages, wipe and put them in 
a copper sugar-boiler with half a pound of loaf-sugar and half a pint of water; when 
it has boiled, cover the pan, move it to the side of the fire, and simmer gently for ten 
minutes. Take out the greengages, strain the syrup, put it back in the sugar-boiler, 
and reduce to thirty degrees. Arrange the greengages tastefully in a compote dish 
and pour the syrup over them. 

Compote of Green Gooseberries. 

Take the gooseberries, cut each one at the side so as to squeeze out the seeds, 
and scald the jackets in hot water until they rise to the top. Take them out and put 
them in salted cold water to make them green. Place them in clarified syrup, and 
simmer, letting them remain for some time in this syrup to sweeten them well. When 
they have remained long enough, take them out, and arrange in the compote-dish. 
Let the syrup continue to boil gently until thick. Pour it over the gooseberries, and 
serve. 

Compote of Grapes. 

Take a bunch or two of fine grapes, cut the stalks off, and make a little slit in 
each and pick out the stones with the point of a quill. Boil some syrup to the large 



662 COLD DESSERTS. 

pearl degree, put in the grapes and boil them up three or four times. When cold, 
skim off any scum that may have risen to the top. Arrange the grapes in a compote- 
dish, and serve. 



Compote of Hazel Nuts. 



After cracking, carefully remove the kernels from some freshly gathered hazel 
nuts; put them on a dish, squeeze over a few drops of lemon juice, and leave them 
for an hour or two. Drain the nuts free from the juice, arrange them in a pyramid 
in a compote-dish, pour over thick syrup flavored with noyeau, and serve. 



Compote of Lemons. 



Pare the lemons very thinly, turning them spirally, make some transverse in- 
cisions upon them, and cut out some fancy designs. Place the lemons in a saucepan 
with sufficient water to cover, and boil gently for about twenty minutes. Drain the 
lemons, put them into a sugar-boiler with some syrup, and let them simmer for about 
twenty minutes longer. At the end of that time put the lemons into a basin with the 
syrup, and leave them for several hours. When ready to serve, arrange them in a 
compote-dish and pour the syrup over them. 

Nectarine Compote. 

Peel and stone some nectarines, cut them in halves and put them in a saucepan 
with some syrup at the small thread degree (see Sugar Boiling), and cook them until 
quite tender. When cold they should be served in a compote dish and the syrup 
poured over. A little spinach green added to the syrup improves the effect. 

Compote of Oranges. 

Put the thin peel of eight oranges into a saucepan with one pound of sugar and 
three breakfast cupfuls of water and boil for twenty minutes, skimming frequently as 
the scum rises. Remove the white pith from the oranges, taking care not to injure 
the inner skin; pull them into quarters, add them to the syrup and simmer gently for 
six minutes longer. Take them out with a skimmer, arrange in a heap on a dish, 
keeping the skin-side downward; boil the syrup until quite thick, and when cold pour 
it over the oranges, and serve. 



Compote of Peaches. 



Peel some ripe peaches, cut in halves and stone them, put them over the fire in a 
saucepan, cover with thick syrup and let them simmer till sufficiently cooked. Crack 
the stones, and when the peaches are done lift them carefully out of the syrup with a 
skimmer, place them in rather a deep dish and put the kernels in. Let the kernels 



COLD DESSERTS. 663 

and syrup boil till pretty thick, add strained lemon-juice to taste, mix in well with 
the syrup and then pour it over the peaches in the dish. This may be served either 
hot or cold. 

Compote of Peaches with Rice. 

Split nine peaches into halves, take out their stones and plunge the peaches into 
boiling water to loosen their skins; drain, peel, put the peaches in a basin and cover 
them with syrup at 30 degrees. Wash one-half pound of rice, blanch it for eight or 
nine minutes, then drain and refresh it; put it in a stewpan with sufficient warm milk 
to cover, adding more milk as it evaporates. When the rice is nearly cooked put it 
in together with a stick of vanilla cut in pieces, and two heaped tablespoonfuls of 
granulated sugar. Take the saucepan off the fire and keep it covered for ten min- 
utes. Butter a border-mould, mix three tablespoonfuls of butter with the rice, and 
put it in the mould pressing it well down. Keep the rice warm for ten minutes, then 
turn it out of the mould onto a dish, fill the center with the halves of the peaches 
building them in a pyramid shape. Reduce some of the syrup with a little apple- 
juice and pour it over them. Blanch and peel some sweet almonds, split them into 
halves, stick one on each peach, and serve with the remainder of the syrup mixed 
with a little maraschino in a sauceboat. 

Compote of Pears. 

Cut four large baking-pears into six pieces each, lengthwise, but keeping one 
whole half for the center of the compote; pare and core the pieces of pears and put 
them in a lined-pan with some 16 degrees syrup, one teaspoonful of prepared cochineal 
and a little lemon-peel. Boil, drain, and 'arrange the quarters in a compote dish, 
putting the half pear on the middle. Boil the syrup till reduced to 30 degrees, pour 
it over the pears when cold, and serve. 

Compote of Pears, Princess. 

Use nine large pears as near one size as possible. Scrape the stalks, turn the 
pears spirally from head to stalk, put them in a preserving-pan with a little syrup 
and let them simmer till tender, but not too soft. A little lemon juice squeezed in 
the water will keep the pears white. When done, remove the pan from the fire and 
leave them till cold in the syrup. Cut off the ends of the pears so as to leave about 
one-half inch in diameter surface at the stalk end. Cut some rings of angelica the 
same diameter as the cut part of the pears and put one on each. Pass some straw- 
berries or cherries through hot syrup, then place one in each of the rings. Cut some 
strips of angelica and run them through the cherry and angelica rings to imitate the 
stalks of the pears. Arrange them in a compote dish, pour some syrup over them, 
and serve. 



664 COLD DESSERTS. 



Compote of Pineapple. 



Peel a pineapple and cut it in slices about one-fourth inch the thickness. Cut all 
the slices in halves with the exception of the middle one which should be left whole. 
Put them in a sugar-boiler with some syrup at 20 degrees, and let them simmer gently 
at the side of the fire for an hour. Put the pineapple into a basin, pour the syrup 
over and let it steep for twenty hours. At the end of that time, put the slices on a 
wire-drainer, strain the syrup through a silk-sieve into a sugar-boiler and boil till 
reduced to 32 degrees. Arrange the half slices of pineapple in the center of a 
compote-dish, put the round slice on the top, pour the syrup over, and serve. 



Compote of Plums. 



Cut the stalks off short from the desired number of plums, prick them all over 
and drop them into a sugar-boiler of syrup simmering gently for five or six minutes, 
then pour into a basin the plums and syrup; place the plums in a compote-dish or 
case with their stalks upward arranged in good order, and pour over them a little of 
the syrup flavored with noyau, and serve. 



Compote of Prunes. 



Wash well in a basin of water one pound of French plums, then remove and put 
them into a stewpan with one quart of water, an ounce of loaf sugar and a small 
piece of cinnamon, placing the pan over the fire. When the water boils, remove the 
pan to one side of the fire, and simmer gently for forty-five minutes; then take out 
the prunes, place them on a sieve to drain, and afterwards put them into a compote- 
dish. Add a couple of ounces of sugar to the liquor, and after straining it put it 
back into the saucepan and reduce it to a syrup at 32 degrees, and when it is cold 
pour it over the prunes, and serve. 

Raspberry Compote. 

Put one pound of raspberries and a small quantity of lemon juice into a sauce- 
pan, pour over sufficient weak syrup to moisten, simmer the whole gently at the side 
of the fire for three or four minutes, remove the raspberries, drain, place them on a 
dish, boil up the syrup to the thread degree, pour it over, and serve. 

Compote of Strawberries. 

Select some fine ripe strawberries, carefully pick off the stems, drop them one 
by one into some syrup boiled to 22 degrees, and allow them to just simmer; then 
pour them carefully into a basin, and leave until cold. Arrange the strawberries in 
the form of an elevated cone in a compote-dish, pour the syrup round, and serve 
them. 



COLD DESSERTS. 665 



Compote of Walnuts. 



Split the walnuts through their natural division with the point of a knife, then 
pass the knife through the inner part of the shell and extract the interior. Free the 
nuts from the white pith, and place them in cold water that has been slightly acidu- 
lated with lemon-juice. Drain the walnuts, pile them in a heap on a compote-dish, 
pour over some syrup that has been well flavored with noyau, and serve. 

Almond Cream. 

Blanch a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds, dry and pound them well. Put 
them into a stewpan with six ounces of loaf-sugar and the yolks of four eggs, and mix 
well with a fork. In another stewpan have one pint of milk into which have been 
placed one ounce of isinglass ; boil slowly down to three-quarters of a pint, pass 
through a tammy, and pour over the preparation in the other stewpan. Stir over the 
fire until it all thickens, when it may be poured into the bowl prepared for it. Let it 
remain until cool, stirring occasionally to keep it smooth, and shortly afterward add 
two wineglassfuls of noyeau, maraschino, or curacoa. 



Apple Cream. 



Pare, core and mince fine some good cooking-apples, put them into a stewpan 
with a piece of butter, a little powdered white sugar and mix in a little water, adding 
a small quantity of beaten egg. Add to this a few drops of lemon or orange essence 
to flavor. Stir smartly over a quick fire for about ten minutes. This makes a nice 
relish for tea, or a good sauce for a batter-pudding. 

Bavarian Cream. 

This cream is served cold, or it is sometimes used to fill a charlotte russe. To 
one pint of thick cream add sufficient sugar to sweeten it and flavor with vanilla or 
lemon. Whisk the cream to a froth, which should be removed as rapidly as it appears, 
and put in a glass dish. Take one and one-half tablespoonfuls of gelatine, and after 
it has thoroughly dissolved add it to. the froth, and mix for fifteen minutes. Place it 
on ice, or in a very cool place for a few hours, when it will be ready for use. 



Brandy Cream. 



Blanch and pound a couple of dozen of sweet and bitter almonds, place in a 
saucepan with a little milk and boil; let the mixture become cool, then add the yolks 
of five eggs beaten up with a little cream, a little sifted sugar, and pour in a couple 
of wineglassfuls of brandy. Mix well in a quart of cream, stirring well by the side 
of the fire until it is well thickened, then pour into small glasses or cups and serve. 



666 COLD DESSERTS. 

Caramel Cream. 

Put a breakfast cupful of moist sugar into a sugar-boiling pan, hold it over a 
slow fire, stir it gently, and when it is a dark-brown, pour it onto the bottom of a char- 
lotte-mould and let it cool. Beat six or eight eggs in a basin with three or more 
yolks, add one quart of milk, and beat again. Then add one pound of caster-sugar 
and a little lemon-peel. Ten minutes later, pass the liquid through a sieve into the 
mould with the caramel, having previously buttered the mould round the sides. Place 
the mould in a stewpan on a trivet, pour round some hot water so that it will reach 
to half the height of the mould, let the water boil up, and then draw the stewpan 
back, or if heated on a gas-stove (which is best) turn low, so that the liquid will pre- 
serve the same degree of heat without boiling. Cover the stewpan, place hot ashes 
on its lid, and let the preparation poach for at least an hour, allowing the cream to 
cool in the water. When time to serve, turn it out onto a dish, and garnish round 
with sweet biscuits and crystallized fruits, angelica, or what fancy may suggest. 

Chateaubriand Cream. 

Place a jelly-mould on the ice, and pour some liquid jelly around it, turning it 
about sideways in order to allow it to set; stick some shredded almonds round the 
sides and top until the mould is covered, then put a little more of the jelly around, 
and, when set, give it another coating. When this has been done, fill in the cavity 
with noyau cream. 

Chestnut Cream. 

Remove the dark skins from about twenty chestnuts, parboil them, and rub the 
light skins off, then pound them in a mortar, and pass them through a sieve. Dilute 
one and a half ounces of gelatine in half a pint of milk, blanch and bruise six sweet 
almonds, and add with the thin rind of half a lemon and a small quantity of sugar; 
put these into a stewpan, and, when the milk is boiling, move to one side until it 
cools, then strain it, and stir in with the chestnut mixture. When it is worked smooth 
add one wineglassful of dry curacoa and one-half pint of whipped cream; pour it into 
a mould and place it on ice. Whip some more cream and sugar to a froth, and when 
the chestnut cream is set, turn it out, and pour the whipped cream around. 

Coffee Cream. 

Boil together one pint of milk and cream and add a small lump of sugar and a 
pinch of salt. Roast four ounces of green coffee-berries in a fryingpan and put the 
beans while hot in with the cream, place the cover on the stewpan and let them steep 
until quite cold. Beat in with the cream the yolks of four eggs, strain it through a 
cloth twice, fill some breakfastcups with it and place these in a large stewpan con- 



COLD DESSERTS. 667 

taining enough water to reach to half their height; place the lid on and a few live 
coals on top of that and let the water simmer. When the cream is set, allow it to 
get cold and then turn it out of the cups. 

Confectioners' Cream. 

Into a saucepan pour one pint of cold milk and set it on the stove. In another 
vessel mix two ounces of powdered sugar with one ounce of wheat flour and one-half 
ounce of corn flour; break in two whole eggs and whisk well for two minutes. When 
the milk is boiling add it to the preparation, and after stirring it for one minute 
longer put it into a saucepan and set it on the stove. Beat thoroughly until it comes 
to a boil, then remove from the fire and add immediately one teaspoonful of essence 
of vanilla. Stir well again for another minute, then pour it into a bowl and let it get 
cold. This mixture is used for many confectioners' purposes. 

Diplomatic Cream. 

Soak one ounce of gelatine in one teacupful of cold water. Pour one pint of 
cream into a saucepan and place it over the fire for a few minutes to warm slightly, 
then whip it and remove the froth; add enough milk to the cream that is left to make 
one pint in all, put in six ounces of sugar and boil up. When it boils add the gela- 
tine, stirring rapidly until the latter dissolves. Strain it through a sieve into a basin 
in which the whites of four or five eggs have previously been whipped and add one 
teaspoonful of essence of vanilla and one tablespoonful of light wine. Stir well and 
when it begins to thicken add the whipped cream and, when thick enough to drop, 
one breakfast cupful of mixed candied fruit. Place in a mould, set it on the ice, and 
when well set turn it out and garnish with angelica leaves, wine jelly or fruit. A 
pint of blanched almonds finely chopped may be used instead of, or as well as, the 
candied fruit. 

Cream Flavored with Cinnamon. 

Put one breakfast cupful of cream into a saucepan with two ounces of caster- 
sugar and add half an ounce of cinnamon broken in pieces; place the pan on the fire 
and boil for fifteen minutes. Meanwhile beat up the whites of four eggs to a stiff 
froth and while the cream is boiling pour them in; boil gently for a minute or two 
longer, strain it onto a dish, sprinkle a little sugar over and add a little orange-flower 
water; bake it about two minutes to give a light-brown color, and serve. 

Cream Flavored with Coffee. 

Separate the whites and yolks of four eggs, put the yolks in a basin with four 
ounces of caster sugar, whip them well and mix in sufficient strong, freshly-made 
coffee to flavor. Pour one pint of milk into a saucepan and place over the fire until 



668 COLD DESSERTS. 

it is on the point of boiling, then stir it in gradually with the beaten eggs. Strain the 
mixture through a fine wire-sieve and pour it into cream cups. Put them in a stew- 
pan with boiling water to three-fourths their height, boil gently until the cream is 
firm with the exception of a little spot in the middle. When cold turn the cream out 
of the cups onto a glass or fancy dish, and serve. 

Cream Flavored with Lemon. 

Put the thinly-pared rind of a small lemon and one pint of milk into a saucepan, 
place it over a slow fire and boil for five minutes. Put five tablespoonfuls of caster- 
sugar into a basin with the yolks of four eggs and beat them well, then stir in gradu- 
ally the boiling milk, taking out the lemon peel. Pour the cream into small cups,

over the fire till thick and on the point of boiling; then remove it at once, for if it 
boils the eggs will curdle, and stir into it two wineglassfuls of white wine. Strain the 
custard into a basin and set it on the ice till cold. Put some slices of jelly-cake into 
a large bowl, pour in the custard, pile some whipped cream on the top, and serve; or, 
if preferred, the custard may be turned into saucers, with small round Italian cakes 
floating in them. 

Flawn of Fruits, Viennese Style. 

Line a scalloped flawn-circle with a tartlet paste; decorate the edge of the border 
with leaves of paste and brush them over with egg. Cover the bottom and sides of 
the mould with paper, fill up the center with flour, put it in a moderate oven and bake 
for forty minutes. This is what is called cooking it "a blanc." Take it out, empty 
out the flour, remove the paper, let it cool, turn it out and mask inwardly with a layer 
of apricot marmalade. Place the crust on a dish, and fifteen minutes before using 
fill the center with a bavarois mixture of rice and almond-milk thickened on the 
ice, putting it in the flawn in layers alternately with apricot marmalade and raising 
it up in the center to the shape of a dome. Place it on the ice for a few minutes to 
get firm, then put a circle of green gages at the base of the bavarois dome, then a 
circle of halves of glazed peaches below. Put a pile of cooked cherries on the 
bavarois in the center of the circle of peaches. Cover all of the fruits over with 
some of their own syrup when quite cold, by means of a paste-brush, and serve. 

Strawberry Flawn. 

Butter a flawn-circle and line it with a nice tart paste. Cover the paste with a 
sheet of buttered paper, and bake it in a slack oven. When cooked remove the 
paper and cover the paste with a thin coating of apricot marmalade. When cold fill 
the hollow of the paste with some nice ripe freshly-gathered strawberries, putting them 
in close layers, and pouring over them a little thick syrup. Whip one-half pint of 
cream to a stiff froth, adding powdered sugar and flavoring to taste. Pour the cream 
over the strawberries, raising it in a dome. Put the flawn in a folded napkin laid on 
a dish, and serve. 

Fruit Bowl. 

Take half of a large pineapple and cut off all the outside pithy part, cut it up 
into slices and then into small squares and put them in a basin; add five or six ripe 
peaches cut in halves, and then in slices, also the same quantity of apricots peeled and 



COLD DESSERTS. 681 

cut into slices, one or two handfuls of stoned cherries and double the quantity of 
raspberries and red currants. Pour over one wineglassful of syrup and two wine- 
glassfuls of claret and set the basin on ice. Put the cuttings from a pineapple into a 
mortar, pound it well, put it into a sieve with one quart of strawberries, rub them 
through into a basin and mix in a quart bottle of champagne mixed with a wineglass- 
ful of syrup. Pack a thin china basin in ice, pour in the champagne mixture, and stir 
for twenty minutes; then add the strained juice of two oranges and the mixed fruits. 
Serve with small fancy biscuits when the mixture is quite cold. 

Glazed Fruits. 

Put in a copper sugar-boiler over the fire one pound of loaf-sugar with one gill of 
cold water and boil until the top is covered with large bubbles, then drop a little of it 
into cold water; if when it is cold it breaks with a snap, it is ready. The sides of the 
boiler must be wiped occasionally with a wet cloth to free them from sugar, and the 
sugar closely watched lest it boil beyond the point indicated. Remove the boiler 
from the fire and glaze the fruits by dipping them into the sugar and then laying 
them on a dish slightly coated with salad oil. 

Fruit Rice. 

Put one breakfast cupful of well-washed rice into a saucepan with six tablespoon- 
fuls of moist sugar, a tablespoonful of butter and three pints of milk, and boil gently 
until tender, stirring it occasionally. Rinse out a mould with cold water, then line it 
round the bottom and sides with any kind of canned fruit, pour the rice gently into 
the prepared mould, being very careful not to disarrange the fruit, and set it in a cold 
place. Whip one pint of thick cream with the juice of the fruit. When quite set 
turn the contents of the mould out onto a fancy dish, pour the whipped cream over 
and round it, and serve. The cream should not be whipped until a half an hour 
before needed. 

Fruit Salad. 

Take half a pound of very ripe cherries and remove the stalks and stones; then 
take a quarter of a pound each of red and white currants and pick and hull a quarter 
of a pound each of raspberries and strawberries; sprinkle over the fruit plenty of 
powdered white sugar and two or three tablespoonfuls of brandy. Stir and shake the 
fruit about lightly until the sugar is dissolved, and serve. 

Vol-au-Vent of Fruits. 

Prepare a vol-au-vent case of puff paste. Bake it in a moderate oven and cover 
it with royal icing. Scald and sweeten one breakfast cupful of cream, stir in twelve 
preserved cherries and six apricots cut in halves, and add two tablespoonfuls erf 



682 COLD DESSERTS. 

orange-flower water. Put two ounces of macaroons at the bottom of the case, pour in 
the cream mixture, also two bananas cut in slices and three rings of angelica, put an- 
other two ounces of macaroons on the top, and serve. 

Iced Raspberries. 

The raspberries must be large and good. Hull them, and examine the hollows 
carefully to see that there are no insects in them. Beat up the white of an egg with 
one wineglassful of water; dip the raspberries, one at a time, into the mixture of egg 
and water, and roll them in powdered sugar, one at a time, as they are taken out of 
the water, place them at short distances from each other on white paper, and leave 
them until they are quite dry, which will probably take six or seven hours. When 
dry, keep in a cool place till served for dessert. 

Iced Strawberries. 

Take off the hulls from a quantity of strawberries, and see that they are quite 
clean and free from grit. Weigh them, and allow to every pound of strawberries 
three-fourths of a pound of white powdered sugar. Place them in a deep glass dish, 
with a layer of sugar between every layer of fruit, and for one and one-half pounds 
of sugar pour over one wineglassful of any fruit-juice that may be preferred. Put 
the dish into a refrigerator and let it remain for an hour and a half. Then remove it, 
sprinkle the tops of the strawberries with finely-pounded ice, and then with powdered 
white sugar, and serve without delay. 



Anisette Jelly with Pears. 



Cut some large pears into six pieces each, boil them in some syrup and color 
with a few drops of prepared cochineal. Whisk a little gelatine over a fire till boil- 
ing, adding the whites of some eggs and a little lump-sugar, to which add the juice 
of lemon and a little water. Take this mixture off, and let it cool, then add a little 
anisette. Drain the pears, and fill a plain cylinder-mould with them and the jelly 
alternately. Pack the mould in ice, and when the jelly is solid, which will probably 
be about two hours, turn out, and serve. 



Arrowroot Jelly. 



Mix an ounce or so of arrowroot with a little cold water, and when smooth, stir 
in some boiling water, beef tea, strong chicken or veal broth, or milk may be used 
instead of water; add a wineglassful of port or Madeira and flavor with nutmeg, or 
vanilla, if milk or water is used. 



COLD DESSERTS. 683 

Brandy Jelly. 

Put a little cold water in a saucepan with half a pound of sugar and a couple of 
ounces of gelatine in small pieces and grate the rind of a lemon in, squeezing in the 
juice as well. Mix thoroughly and place the saucepan on a hot stove. Beat up in a 
basin the whites of two eggs and add to the above mixture; grate a Uttle nutmeg, 
adding six cloves and a bay leaf, mixing well for a minute. Have ready a jelly-bag 
tied on a stand; stir the preparation, and when it comes to a boil, set back to a cooler 
part of the stove and continue to stir for six minutes. Put a vessel underneath the 
jelly-bag and pour the whole of the contents of the pan into the bag, repeating the 
straining process until the jelly is bright, and then add a gill of brandy. Have in 
readiness a quart jelly-mould and pour the jelly from the vessel into it and set in a 
cool place for two hours, then pack it in ice and let it remain there for two hours longer. 
To remove the jelly from the mould, dip it lightly in warmed water and take it up at 
once, turn out, wipe neatly, and serve. 



Calf's Foot Jelly. 



Cleanse and wash four calf's feet and put them into a saucepan with one gallon 
of water, and add two ounces of isinglass and a little lemon-peel. Place the pan 
over a moderate fire and stew slowly until a strong jelly is formed; carefully skim off 
the fat and pour in a quart of white wine. When this is incorporated, work in one 
pound of loaf-sugar, the juice of seven lemons and the whites of fifteen eggs beaten 
to a froth. Put the pan on the fire again and boil for fifteen minutes longer; remove to 
the side and let the jelly remain for a few minutes in order to settle; then strain it 
through a jelly-bag into moulds. When entirely cold, turn it out, and serve. 

Champagne Jelly. 

Dissolve two ounces of gelatine in one quart of cold water, pour it into a sauce- 
pan and add the juice of two lemons and three oranges and the whites of two or three 
fresh eggs and all the shells and three-quarters of a pound of sugar; mix thoroughly, 
pour in another pint of water, place the saucepan over the fire and stir it continually 
until the liquor boils. Remove it to the side of the fire and let it keep hot without 
boiling for fifteen minutes longer. Then run it through a jelly-bag, adding a pint of 
champagne, pour it into moulds and let it set. Turn it out, and serve. 

Champagne Jelly in Glasses. 

Put fifteen leaves of gelatine in a basin, cover them with cold water and allow 
them to soften for half an hour; then drain off the water. Find out the consistence 
of the gelatine, pour it into the champagne glasses, not allowing the liquid to come 
quite to the brim, place them in a bucket, surround them with ice, cover the top and 



684 COLD DESSERTS. 

allow the jelly to set. Pour into a basin a little dissolved jelly and whip it until it is 
white and frothy; then take up tablespoonfuls and put it into each of the glasses 
when the other jelly is set. When the froth is cool wipe the glasses and serve. 

Cherry Jelly. 

Remove the stalks and stones from two or three pounds of cherries, place them 
in a basin, pound the kernels and squeeze in the juice of three lemons through a 
sieve. Mash the cherries with a wooden spoon, adding about one teacupfu*! of red 
currant jelly; then add the kernels and stir all well together. Boil and skim one pint 
of clarified sugar and isinglass, put the cherries into a jelly bag, pour this syrup over 
them and pass it through until quite clear If it is not sweet enough add more sugar; 
if too sweet add more lemon-juice. Dampen a mould, pack it in ice, fill it with the 
jelly and turn it out when firm and well set. 

Claret Jelly. 

Into an enameled saucepan put one-fourth pound of lump-sugar, ten drams of 
gelatine, half a pint of claret and half a wineglassful of brandy and let them soak for 
ten minutes. Then put in the very thin rind of half a lemon, together with half a 
pound of currant jelly. Place the saucepan on the stove and stir until it boils, then 
draw it to the side and let simmer for five minutes. Moisten the inside of a jelly- 
mould with cold water, strain the jelly into it, and when quite cold turn it into a 
glass dish, and serve. 

Constantine Jelly- 
Cut in halves half a dozen apricots, remove the stones, place the apricots in a 
saucepan with a little syrup, and boil until done. Allow them to get cold and cut 
each half into three pieces. Pack an ornamental mould in ice, pour a little warm 
jelly at the bottom, sprinkle in a little desiccated cocoanut mixed with shredded pis- 
tachio nuts, and when the other is set pour over a little more jelly; then put a layer 
of the strips of apricots, then more jelly, then cocoanut and kernels, and continue in 
this way until the mould is full, allowing each layer to set before another is added. 
Turn it out onto a dish when set, fill the cavity with whipped cream mixed with more 
desiccated cocoanut and pistachio nuts, and serve. 

Crystal Jellies. 

Put one ounce of isinglass in a saucepan with one pint of water, and the rind of 
one lemon. When it boils stir in one pound of loaf-sugar and one-half pint of light 
wine. When the isinglass is well dissolved, strain it through a jelly-bag and let it 
stand until cold. Squeeze the juice of two or three lemons in a cup, keeping back 
the pips. Grate the rind of one lemon in the juice, and allow it to remain for a short 



COLD DESSERTS. 685 

time. Strain the juice into the jelly, whisk it until it begins to stiffen, then turn it 
into the jelly moulds and let it set. When ready to serve, turn the jellies onto a 
glass dish. 

Dantzig Sweet Jelly. 

Clarify from sixteen to twenty leaves of French gelatine, and when it is cold mix 
with it about one-half pint of Dantzig brandy, and add the syrup required to sweeten. 
When the jelly is half set, put it on ice, and stir it for a time without allowing it to 
thicken; then put in two tablespoonfuls of -pistachios cut in slices. Pack in ice a 
cylinder-mould, pour the jelly into it and let it stand for an hour ; then dip the mould 
in tepid water, wipe it thoroughly all round, and turn the jelly out onto a glass dish.

sugar and the grated peel and juice of one lemon. When mixed put in a jar, stand 
in a saucepan, surround with boiling water, and let it stand until cooked. Jelly pre- 
pared in this way is used for spreading over sponge-cake. 



French Sweet Jelly. 



Prepare one quart of calf's foot or gelatine jelly, sweeten and flavor it with 
sherry-wine. Choose a fancy jelly-mould, pour in a small quantity of the jelly, and 
leave it to set for two hours. Choose some fine ripe fruit of any kind in season, wipe 
it and pick off the stalks; arrange the fruit tastefully around the edge of the mould, 
fixing them in place with a little jelly; pour in more of the jelly and let it set, con- 
tinuing in this way until the mould is full. When the jelly is well set, turn it onto a 
fancy glass dish, garnish with crystallized fruits, and serve. 



Gelatine Jelly. 



Soak and dissolve half an ounce of gelatine in a gill of cold water, pour over it 
half a pint of boiling water and stir until the gelatine has quite melted; then add 
sugar to taste and a flavoring of thinly-pared lemon peel. When it is quite cold set 
it over the fire with the beaten whites and shells of two eggs, and let it come to a 
boil, but do not stir it. As soon as it boils take it from the fire and gently pour in 
one tablespoonful of cold water; let it stand for five or ten minutes and then run it 
through a jelly-bag. If it is not quite clear, run it through the bag again. When 
quite clear, mix with it a gill of wine, let stand until nearly cold and pour it into the 
mould. When set, turn out, and serve. 



686 COLD DESSERTS. 



Jamaica Jelly. 



Boil one pound of sugar together with two ounces of clarified isinglass and one 
wineglassful of Jamaica rum until reduced to a clear jelly. Rinse a mould out with

over thick cream, and serve. 



Kirsch Jelly, with Cherries. 



Put in some syrup boiled at thirty degrees one pound of morello cherries, and 
boil them for five minutes. Put in a stewpan two ounces of gelatine, the beaten 
whites of three eggs, one pound of sugar and three pints of water, with the juice of a 
lemon. Whisk it over the fire until it boils, turn it out and add one and one-half 
teacupfuls of kirsch after it is cold. Crack about fifty cherry stones, blanch and peel 
the kernels, drain the cherries, and put a layer first of jelly and then of cherries and 
a sprinkling of the kernels in a plain cylinder-mould, and keep on in this way till the 
mould is full. Cover with a tin sheet, pack it in ice, put ice on the tin, and let the 
jelly freeze for two hours. Turn it out of the mould onto an ornamental dish. The 
jelly may be garnished with crystallized fruits. 

Kiimmel Jelly. 

Pour one quart of cold water into a saucepan with one-half pound of granulated 
sugar, two ounces of gelatine broken into small pieces, and the grated rind of a

pan on a hot stove. Beat up the whites of two eggs, add them to the other mixture 
grate in one saltspoonful of nutmeg, add half a dozen cloves and one bay leaf, and 
stir well with a whisk for one minute. Have in readiness a jelly-bag tied on a stand. 
Stir the mixture, and when ready to boil place it on a cooler part of the stove to keep 
it from overflowing, stirring it while boiling for six minutes. Put a vessel under the 
jelly-bag, remove the pan from the fire, and pour all into a bag, adding immediately 
one gill of kummel. Allow it to drain into the vessel, and then return it to the bag, 
placing another vessel underneath, and drain again for fully two hours. Have ready 
a quart jelly-mould, pour the jelly from the vessel into it, set it aside to cool for two 
hours, and then pack it in ice and let harden for two hours longer. Dip the mould

quart of water, and then strain it through a fine hair-sieve. Mix one and one-half 
pints of Madeira wine with the strained liquor, turn the whole into a copper whip- 
ping-bowl packed in ice, and whip the jelly well. In about twenty minutes time 
remove the jelly from the ice, and whip it for ten minutes longer. If it has come to 
be too firm, stand the bowl in a large basin of hot water, and whip it for another 
minute or two. When beaten to a stiff froth, pour the jelly into a mould, pack it in 
ice, and leave it for a couple of hours or so. When ready to serve, dip the mould in 
warm water to loosen the contents, then wipe the edges of the mould and turn out 
the jelly. 



Maraschino Jelly. 



Cut a calf's foot in pieces, place it in a saucepan in cold water, and boil for two 
minutes; then wash in cold water and again put it in a saucepan with one quart of 
cold water. When boiling, remove to the side of the fire, and simmer gently for two 
hours and a half, keeping it well skimmed. After that, strain the liquor into a basin, 
and leave it until it is quite cold; take off all the fat, and wipe the top off with a 
cloth dipped in hot water. Turn the jelly onto a basin, scrape off all the sediment, 
place the jelly in a stewpan, and melt it; then add the juice and rind of a lemon, the 
whites of two whisked eggs, and loaf-sugar to taste. Whisk this over the fire until 
boiling, then take it off; rinse a jelly-bag, place the lemon-rind at the bottom and 
strain the jelly through. Flavor to taste with maraschino, pour it into a mould, and 
stand it on ice. When it is quite firm, dip the mould in hot water, wipe, turn the 
jelly onto a dish, and serve. 



Marbled Jelly. 



Take a jelly-mould, place some pieces of sweet jelly at the bottom; over these 
pour some more that has had milk or cream mixed with it to render it white, so as to 
form the veins of the marble. The jelly should be only liquid, for if it is too warm 
it will melt the other, and ruin the effect. Allow the jelly to get cool as soon as pos- 
sible, then proceed as before, and keep on in that way until the mould is full; pack it 
in ice and leave it until the jelly is quite set. When ready, dip the mould in warm 
water, and turn out on a glass dish. 



688 COLD DESSERTS. 



Noyau Jelly. 



Put one ounce of isinglass into two gills of lukewarm water, and stir over the fire

to the dissolved gelatine. Sweeten to taste with loaf sugar, and boil the whole for a 
few minutes. Clarify the jelly with the whites of two eggs and their shells beaten 
together, and strain it through a jelly-bag. Rinse a mould out with cold water, pour 
the jelly into it, and leave until set and cold. When ready to serve, turn the jelly 
onto a fancy dish. 



Peach Jelly. 



Procure some large peaches, not too ripe; wipe them well and take out the 
stones; cut the peaches in quarters, and put them in a covered jar. Crack the stones, 
cut the kernels into small pieces, and put them in with the peaches. Set the jar in a 
saucepan of boiling water, taking care it does not come over the top, and let it boil 
till the peaches are soft. Strain them through a jelly-bag to extract all the juice; 
measure the juice, and put it in a preserving-pan with one pound of sugar for every 
pint of juice. Boil them for twenty minutes and skin carefully. Turn the jelly into 
glasses and when cold, lay a round of paper that has been dipped in brandy on each, put 
another paper on the top and tie down. They will keep in good condition for some 
time. 



Pear Jelly. 



Select ripe juicy pears and cut them into quarters. Put them in a preserving-pan 
with one pint of water for every four pounds of pears, place them over a slow fire, 
and boil till reduced to a pulp. Put the pears into a jelly-bag, which should be hung 
over a basin, and let them drain for twelve or fourteen hours. At the end of that 
time squeeze the bag to obtain any juice that may not have run through into the 
basin, measure the juice, and put it into the preserving-pan with four ounces of loaf- 
sugar for every breakfast cupful of it. Flavor with a small quantity of lemon-juice, 
and boil it over a brisk fire stirring continually until reduced to a jelly. Turn the

and serve. 

Princess Victoria Jelly. 

Pour one pint of milk into a saucepan and add a small lump of sugar and the 
rind of half a lemon, one ounce of gelatine, a few bruised coriander-seeds and a 
slight flavoring of vanilla. Place the saucepan on the fire and stir continually until 
the gelatine is quite dissolved. Pass it through a fine sieve into a basin and divide 
into three equal quantities. Color one of these with cochineal, leaving the other two 
white. Have ready an equal quantity of jelly beaten up with gold-leaf. Pour half 
the white jelly into a shallow round tin mould packed in ice, allow it to become firm, 
then pour over the cochineal-colored jelly, and when this has set the gold-leaf or 
Dantzic jelly and finally the balance of the white or plain jelly. Cover the mould 
with a lid, pack the top with ice and allow it to remain until the whole is quite firm. 
Take out the mould, turn out the contents and cut it at once into bands or strips; 
decorate the top and sides of a plain mould with these, fill the center with any kind 
of fruit and jelly, and pack the mould again in ice. When set, turn the jelly out onto 
a dish, and serve.

with the prunes. Next soak one ounce of gelatine in a small quantity of water, and 
mix it in with the prunes, adding two wineglassfuls of port wine. Turn the jelly into 
a stewpan, and boil it for a few minutes, stirring it all the time. Blanch two ounces 
of sweet almonds, and split them lengthwise into halves, ornament the inside of the 
mould with them, fastening them with a little liquid jelly, and stand it on the ice to 
cool. When ready, dip the mould quickly into hot water to loosen the jelly, wipe it, 
and turn the contents onto a dish, pour around the sauce, and serve.

Soak one ounce of isinglass in one pint of water, and add the eighth part of the 
well-beaten white of an egg, put it in a saucepan over the fire, and, when nearly 
melted, add one pound of lump-sugar, broken small, and one-third of a tablespoonful 
of powdered cochineal, and ten minutes before taking from the fire, add the grated 
rind of three lemons. Remove the pan from the fire, and add the juice of four lemons 
and one-half pint of white wine. Strain through a cotton cloth, and, if it looks thick, 
boil up once. The saucepan should be kept covered while the jelly boils. Allow it 
to stand and cool before pouring into a mould, which should have the inside dampened 
with water. 

Rhubarb Jelly Border with Whipped Cream. 

Cut up into pieces three pounds of rhubarb, put them into a preserving-pan with 
an equal quantity of sugar, and pour over a little water to prevent the pieces from 
sticking to the bottom or burning. Set the pan over a very gentle fire, and stir it 
well until the fruit is quite soft; then pass it through a fine sieve into a basin, and to 
each quart of pulp mix in two ounces of dissolved gelatine. Turn the preparation

Soak one and one-half ounces of gelatine, then put it in a saucepan with one 
quart of water, one-half pound of loaf sugar, the beaten whites and shells of two 
eggs, the strained juice of two lemons and one tablespoonful of whole mixed spices. 
Boil the ingredients slowly for about half an hour, adding a little more water occa- 
sionally to keep up the original quantity of jelly. Pass it two or three times through 
a jelly-bag till it is quite clear and transparent, then pour it into a basin and place it 
one side for use. The stock can be divided and made into as many different kinds 
as may be desired. Orange or lemon extracts should not be used for flavorings, as 
they dim the transparent clearness of the jelly and give to it a cloudy appearance. 

St. Petersburgh Jelly. 

Warm one pint of lemon jelly and pour half of it into one basin and the other 
half into another. Color one of these with cochineal and flavor the other with noyau. 
When the cochineal jelly is nearly set, whisk it well and throw into it the noyau 
jelly already nearly set and cut up into small pieces and mixed up with a few pistachio- 
nuts cut very fine. Place the whole in a fancy-shaped mould, pack in ice, cover over 
the top, pack ice on it, and let it remain until set and quite firm. Dip the mould 
into warm water, wipe it dry with a cloth, turn the jelly out onto a dish, and serve. 



692 COLD DESSERTS. 

Strawberry Jelly. 

Pick the stems from one and one-half pound of strawberries, put them in a 
basin, cover them with one quart of syrup at 30 degrees (see Sugar Boiling), that has 
cooled a little, and let them stand to steep for an hour. Whisk over the fire in a stew- 
pan three and one-half ounces of gelatine, the whites of three eggs, the juice of a 
lemon and one quart of water. When it boils, remove it. Strain the strawberries 
through a jelly-bag and mix the syrup with the gelatine. Pour the mixture into a 
mould, pack it in ice, cover it with a baking-sheet, put ice on the top and let it 
set for two hours. When ready to serve, turn the jelly out onto a dish. 

Tapioca Jelly. 

Put one-half teacupful of tapioca into a basin with one breakfast cupful of cold 
water and let it steep for two hours, standing the basin in a warm place. Pour two 
more breakfast cupfuls of water into a saucepan, add six or eight ounces of sugar, 
and then the rind of half a lemon cut up into shreds, and squeeze in the juice of half 
a lemon. Boil for a few minutes, pour in the tapioca and water and cook gently for 
about twenty minutes at the side of the fire, by which time the tapioca should be 
quite transparent. Add a little syrup of cranberries or burnt sugar to color, pour the 
jelly into a mould, let it set, turn it out onto a dish and serve with sweet cream. The 
coloring may be dispensed with if desired. 

Vanilla Jelly. 

Cut into pieces two vanilla beans, pour over them one quart of boiling water and 
turn them into a lined pan. Steep two and one-half ounces of gelatine in one pint 
of cold water for thirty minutes or so, then strain it and pour one pint of boiling 
water over it. Put the dissolved gelatine in the pan with the vanilla, add three- 
fourths of a pound of sugar, the juice and finely-shred peel of two oranges and two 
lemons and the shells and well-beaten whites of four or five eggs. Place the pan 
over the fire and stir the contents till boiling, then strain the mixture through a jelly- 
bag, repeating the operation till it runs quite clear. Decorate a mould with dried 
fruits or strawberries, then pour in the mixture and place it on the ice until firm. 
Turn the jelly out onto a fancy dish, and serve it. 

Venetian Jelly. 

Put one ounce of soaked gelatine into a saucepan with three-fourths of a pint of 
hot water and place it over the fire until dissolved ; then add one-fourth pound of 
coarsely-crushed loaf sugar and the juice of three lemons. Beat the whites and 
shells of three eggs, stir them into the jelly and boil for five minutes longer. Remove 
the jelly from the fire, strain it and mix in three wineglassfuls of sherry and one 



COLD DESSERTS. 693 

wineglassful of brandy. Decorate the interior of a plain mould with small pieces of 
candied peel, dipping them in the jelly to make them stick, then half-fill the mould 
with the jelly and leave until set. Put one-half ounce of soaked gelatine in a sauce- 
pan with one-half pint of milk and two ounces of sugar; stir over the fire until dis- 
solved; then move it to the side and mix in quickly the beaten yolks of two eggs. 
Move the custard away from the fire and allow it to cool. Moisten one-half pound 
of sponge cakes with as much sherry as they will absorb, then lay them on the top 
of the set jelly in the mould; when the custard has sufficiently cooled fill the mould 
up with it and place it on ice for an hour or two. When ready, dip the mould in tepid 
water, wipe dry and turn it out onto a fancy dish. 

Jelly with Fruit Champagne. 

Put into a stewpan the whites of three well-beaten eggs, three-fourths of a pound 
of powdered sugar, the juice of one lemon, two ounces of gelatine, and one quart of 
water ; whisk it over the fire until it boils. Remove the jelly from the fire, strain it 
two or three times through a jelly-bag till quite clear, and when cold stir in one 
pint of champagne. Make a mixed mince of apples and pears which have been 
boiled in syrup, and cut to olive-shapes preserved apricots, greengages and dried 
cherries. Pour a little jelly into the bottom of a plain cylinder-mould, then a layer 
of fruit, a layer of jelly, and so on until the mould is nearly full. Pack the mould 
in ice, and when set fill it up with plain jelly, place a baking-sheet with ice on it over 
the mould, and allow it to freeze for two hours. It is then ready for serving. 

Jelly with Whipped Cream. 

Prepare one and one-half pints of clear jelly flavored to taste. Rinse the inside 
of a cylinder-mould with clear cold water, fill it with the jelly, and stand it on the ice 
to set. Whip three-fourths of a pint of cream together with a glass of white wine 
and a little sugar. When the jelly is firm, turn it onto a dish, fill the center with 
whipped cream, pour a small quantity round the dish, garnish the jelly with candied 
cherries, and serve. 

Lemon Froth. 

Soak two ounces of gelatine and dissolve it in one pint of boiling water, then 
pour in one pint of cold water and add the peels and strained juice of six lemons. 
Let it stand until it commences to set, then take out the peels and add the whites of 
a dozen eggs beaten to a stiff froth. When well beaten into the jelly, turn into a 
glass bowl, garnish with ratafias, and serve. 

Maraschino Cheese. 

Melt a little isinglass in hot water ; whip one and one-half pints of thick cream 
to a stiff froth, and mix with it the dissolved isinglass, the strained juice of one lemon, 



694 COLD DESSERTS. 

and three wineglassfuls of maraschino. Stir the above over ice until well mixed and 
on the point of freezing, then turn it into a mould and pack it in ice till quite firm. 
When ready to serve, dip the mould in tepid water, wipe, and turn the cheese onto a 
glass or fancy dish. 

Meringues. 

Put in a pan a pound of granulated sugar with a pint of cold water, and place it 
on the hot stove. Have two quarts of ice- water in a bowl, and when the sugar comes 
to the boil dip the fingers in the ice-water and pass them quickly round the inside of the 
sugar-pan after boiling for five minutes. Dip a wooden stick in the ice-water, then in the 
sugar, and again in the ice-water, lifting up the stick to feel the sugar that adheres. 
If it cannot be formed into a ball, boil it a little longer, and when it is ready, remove it 
from the fire so that it no longer boils. While the sugar is cooking beat the whites 
of five eggs in a copper basin, and while beating place the sugar in very carefully ; 
when all is added, lay the basin in ice-water. Mix this gently for five minutes, adding 
one teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring. Cover the basin with a napkin, leaving it for ten 
minutes. Butter and flour a baking-sheet ; slide a fancy tube into a silk bag, fill the 
bag with the preparation, press it out on the baking-sheet in the shape of letters. 
Sprinkle lightly with powdered sugar, place in a very slow oven and bake for fifteen 
minutes. When they are baked, these cakes should be white. Remove them from 
the oven, let them get cold, dress on a glass stand, and serve. 



Almond Meringues. 



Put the whites of a few eggs in a bowl and whisk to a stiff froth, adding some 
powdered sugar; continue to whisk vigorously and mix in as much of sweet almonds 
finely-chopped and blanched as there was sugar used. Drop the mixture onto pieces 
of thin paper, and put them to dry in a drying-closet or slow oven with the door 
open. Take them out, carefully remove the paper either by dampening or easing 
with a knife, and arrange on a dish, serving them quite cold and dry. 

Apple Meringue. 

Pare and core seven large apples and bake in a shallow plate until soft but not 
broken. Beat the yolks of three eggs with three tablespoonfuls of finely-powdered 
sugar, a little salt and a pint of scalded milk. Pour this over the baked apples, which 
have been piled up in the form of a pyramid. Bake until the custard is firm; then 
remove and allow to cool. Make a meringue of the whites of the three eggs by beat- 
ing them till foamy, gradually adding three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and a 
little lemon, flavoring and beat until quite stiff. Place this over the apples and place 
in the oven to brown. 



COLD DESSERTS. 695 

Chocolate Meringues. 

Put the whites of three eggs in a basin with one pound of finely-crushed sugar, 
beat well for about fifteen minutes; then add three more whites, putting them in 
singly and beating one up well before another one is added; then mix in two tea- 
spoonfuls of vanilla and three ounces of grated chocolate. Put this in a biscuit 
forcer, let it drop on a well-buttered baking-sheet, place the meringues in a slow 
oven and bake for a few minutes 

( 

Florentine Meringues. 

Cover the bottom of a baking-pan with a sheet of puff-paste rolled out thin, 
spread some jelly over it and cover all with meringue-paste mixed with chopped 
almonds. Sprinkle over with sugar, bake in a moderate oven, and cut into squares. 

Italian Meringues. 

Place a pound and a quarter of sugar in a boiler and boil to the blow degree 
and place the boiler in a large basin of cold water to set the sugar. Work the sugar 
against the side of the pan; when it is nearly transparent pour in the whites of four 
eggs, then the juice of one lemon and a liqueur glassful of liqueur and mix thor- 
oughly. Have some strips of paper arranged on a board, place on them small quan- 
tities of the paste arranged in the shape of eggs and bake in the oven with the door 
open until they begin to color. Take them out and off the paper and they are 
ready for use. They require to be dried rather than baked; therefore the oven must 
not be hot enough to color a piece of paper. The paste previous to being made can 
be colored either brown or saffron with chocolate or a light-rose pink with a few 
drops of cochineal. In making these meringues more sugar is used than for the 
ordinary ones; therefore they do not require to be dredged with sugar before they 
are baked. They should be taken off the paper and pressed together or they can be 
scooped in the center and be filled with cream; they may also be covered with trans- 
parent ice by dipping them in it. 

Meringue Kisses. 

Whisk the whites of two eggs to as stiff a froth as possible, then beat in very 
gradually, one teaspoonful at a time, one-half pound of powdered white sugar, add 
six drops of lemon essence, and beat all together very thoroughly. Take a square 
tin pan, place a sheet of wet paper at the bottom, and drop onto it, at equal distances, 
small spoonfuls of red currant jelly. With a larger spoon take some of the beaten 
egg and sugar and pile it over each lump of jelly, so as to cover entirely, dropping it 
on as smoothly as possible, so as to make the meringues smooth and round. Bake 
them in a cool oven till each two that have been placed together adhere to one another. 



696 COLD DESSERTS. 

Lemon Meringue. 

Soak two breakfast cupfuls of stale breadcrumbs in one quart of new milk, then 
stir with them one breakfast cupful of sugar, the yolks of four eggs, and the grated 
rind of a lemon. Beat these until light, then pour into a buttered baking-dish and 
bake like a custard, spreading some fruit jelly over the meringue. Beat the whites 
of four eggs together with four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and the juice of one 
lemon to a stiff froth, spread it over the top, and bake till brown. Serve either hot 
or cold. 

Peach Meringue. 

Peel some ripe peaches and stew them. When nearly done, mix some sugar and 
a teaspoonful of butter with them. Butter a deep pie-dish, line it with short paste 
and bake. Remove the crust from the oven, put the stewed fruit in it, cover with the 
whites of three eggs beaten to a stiff froth and sweetened with three tablespoonfuls 
of powdered sugar, and put it back in the oven to brown lightly. Serve either hot 
or cold. 



Pineapple Meringue. 



Peel a medium-sized pineapple, slice and then cut into pieces about an inch in 
length and a quarter of an inch thick, place in a preserving-pan with a half pound of 
crushed loaf-sugar and half a pint of water, stirring it well over the fire until it is 
reduced to a rather thick syrup; then pour a pint and a half of milk into a saucepan 
over the fire, and when it comes to a boil put into it the trimmings. of the pineapple, 
cover it with the lid, and steep for about ten minutes. Beat the yolks of ten eggs, 
strain the milk and stir it gradually in with them; then pour the milk and eggs again 
into the saucepan and stir it over the fire until thick, but do not allow it to boil. 
Press the cream through a silk sieve into a basin and mix the pineapple and the syrup 
with it. When cold, put the cream in a freezing-pot and work well over the ice until 
it is frozen. Then put the frozen cream in a plain, oval-shaped mould, filling it to 
the top, close tightly, and pack well in pounded ice and salt. Boil four ounces of 
sugar to the sixth degree, and whip the whites of five eggs to a stiff froth, mix the 
sugar with them and leave until cold. Turn the contents of the mould quickly over 
a dish that has been placed on ice, pour the meringue over, and put in a hot oven 
just to set, and lightly brown the meringue and take out and serve it at once. 



Meringue Shells. 



Prepare a meringue mixture. Slide a tube down a pastry-bag, lay a piece of 
paper over a baking-sheet, and after putting the meringue into the bag, press it out 
into the paper, giving it an egg-shape two and one-half inches long by one inch in 
height. There should be sufficient to make eighteen equal-sized shells. Be careful 



COLD DESSERTS. 697 

to keep them about one inch apart. Sprinkle liberally with powdered sugar, and 
place in a slow oven to bake for half an hour. Remove, allow it to cool for twenty- 
five minutes, turn the paper containing the shells upside down on the table, and with 
a wet cloth or brush moisten the paper well; turn it over once more and leave for two 
minutes, when the shells can be easily detached. With the finger press them gently, 
one by one, at the bottom, into a perfect shell-shape. Return to the baking-sheet, 
laying them upside down, place them in the oven to dry thoroughly for ten minutes, 
and leave to cool for thirty minutes longer. Keep them in a dry place, either in a tin 
or paper box, and use when required. Meringue shells prepared in this way will 
keep well for nearly or quite a month. 

Strawberry Meringue. 

Beat one breakfast cupful of powdered sugar with five or six eggs for a few min- 
utes, then add one-fourth of a pound of warmed butter and one teacupful of milk; 
mix one teaspoonful of baking-powder with three breakfast cupfuls of flour, then sift 
it gradually into the above mixture, and stir until smooth. Turn the mixture into a 
large shallow baking-pan, spreading it thinly, but making it thicker around the edges 
than in the middle, as the paste is liable to rise in the center. Bake the cake, and 
then put a layer of freshly-picked strawberries on the top, cover them with meringue, 
then place the cake in the oven for a minute or two. When lightly colored on the 
top, take the cake out of the oven, cut it into squares, and serve. 

Orange Baskets. 

Select some oranges with a clear skin, and, with a blunt knife, mark out the 
handle and rim of the baskets in Vandykes. With a sharp knife cut through the rind 
over the traced lines, taking care not to cut through the pulp. Take off the two 
spare pieces of peel, and, with the handle of a teaspoon, carefully take out all the 
pulp from the basket. Fill up the baskets with orange jelly or whipped cream, and 
decorate with crystalized flowers; put a large flat of sponge-cake in the center of a 
dish that has had a napkin spread over it, put one basket on top of the cake, and 
surround with the remainder. Any form of extra ornamentations can be put in the 
basket. 

Orange Butter. 

Boil twelve eggs until hard, peel, cut them into halves, and put their yolks in a 
mortar with two ounces of sugar, four ounces of butter, and two ounces of blanched 
and chopped sweet almonds; pound the whole to a smooth paste, moistening it occa- 
sionally with orange-flower water, then rub it through a sieve onto a glass dish. 
Serve the butter with any kind of sweet or fancy biscuits. 



698 COLD DESSERTS. 

Orange Salad. 

Peel six oranges, -scrape off all the pith, and cut them into slices. Take out the 
pips, put a layer of the slices on a dish, and sprinkle over them some powdered 
sugar and a little brandy or rum. Continue in this way until they are all used up, 
and serve. They may be piled in the shape of a pyramid. 

Oranges, French Style. 

Cut six oranges into halves, remove all the insides, taking care not to injure the 
rinds; notch evenly round the edges of the rinds, and put them into cold water to 
soak. Squeeze out all the juice from the pulp, strain it into a saucepan, pour in water 
to make three gills in all, add one and one-half ounce of gelatine dissolved in one 
and one-half teacupfuls of water, also six ounces of sugar, the thin rind and juice of a 
lemon, and the whites and crushed shells of three eggs. Whisk well over the fire 
until the liquor boils, remove the whisk, put the lid on the pan, and boil slowly for 
ten minutes. Remove the pan from the fire, let it stand for five minutes, and strain 
through a jelly-bag until clear; wipe the orange peels perfectly dry, fill them level 
with the jelly, packing them in ice to keep them firm, heap up on top one-half pint 
of cream beaten stiff, with one teaspoonful of crushed loaf-sugar and a few drops of 
vanilla; place a sweetmeat on the top of each, and serve on a dessert-dish. 

Frosted Peaches. 

Take two dozen ripe peaches and rub the fur off with a soft cloth. Beat the 
whites of six eggs and one teacupful of water to a stiff froth, and dip the peaches 
into it one at a time, rolling each one immediately in powdered white sugar, then lay 
them stem end downwards, on white paper, on a tray; place it in a window well 
exposed to the sun; when half dry, roll them again in sugar and place in the sun till 
quite dry; then keep in a cool place till wanted for use. Arrange them in a glass 
dish, and garnish with green leaves. 

Pear Salad. 

Peel and core some ripe pears, cut them in thin slices, and lay them in a glass 
dish, sprinkle powdered sugar over them, pour in a little brandy or rum, and serve. 

Stuffed Pears. 

Select a large pear, not too ripe, and peel it, but do not remove the stalk. Cut 
the pear lengthwise about two-thirds of its height from the side on which it is lying. 
Take out the inside with a vegetable-spoon. Cook the pieces of pear by boiling in a 
little sugar and water, but keep them firm, and leave in the syrup till cold. Drain the 



COLD DESSERTS. 699 

pear on a cloth. Put a layer of cooked rice and cream on a dish, put the thick part 
of the pear on it, fill the hollow with a salpicon of fruits thickened with a little apricot 
marmalade, put the other piece of pear on the top, and arrange a circle of crystallized 
green gages round it. Reduce the syrup flavor with a little vanilla extract, and pour 
it, when cold, over the pear. 

Apple Pies. 

Use either a good puff-paste or rub together half a pound of butter to every 
pound of flour used, until evenly mixed ; then pour in a little cold water and salt, and 
stir up with two fingers drawing in the flour gradually. Spread some of the flour on 
the table, and pat the paste into a smooth mass in it ; roll out the paste once, fold up 
as you would a napkin, and it is ready to use. Cover each patty-pan with a layer of 
paste, rolled thin. Peel some good apples, slice them off the cores into the pie, and 
cover with another crust; cut off the edges by pressing with both hands against the 
patty-pan, turning it round at the same time. Bake in a slack oven until the apples 
are done, say from fifteen to thirty minutes. If desired, a little nutmeg or cinnamon 
may be added, dredge a little flour over and add before the top crust is put on. 
A little sugar dusted over the top after they are baked improves the appearance. 

Apple Custard Pie. 

Peel, core and chop up enough apples to make the number of pies desired, stew 
them in not more than sufficient water to keep them from burning. When done, mash 
well, and add to each quart of fruit the following: Four eggs (well beaten), one pint 
of sweet milk, four ounces of butter (melted), a grated nutmeg, one teaspoonful of 
lemon juice, and a half pound of powdered sugar. When the apples are cool, stir 
all up together and bake in a rich pastry crust. 

Apricot Pie. 

Take an ordinary pie-dish and make sufficient tart paste, according to the size 
of tart proposed to be made ; lay closely pressed around the border of the dish, pre- 
viously moistened, a band of paste three inches wide and a sixth of an inch thick. 
Within the dish arrange halves of apricots to fill it (unripe fruit will do for these 
pies), a little sugar and an ounce or two of butter. Roll out some more paste to 
make a crust, and, wetting the band, cover over with the sheet of paste, press the 
edges down, and trim. Brush over the top with the white of egg and strew finely- 
broken sugar over it. Bake for an hour and a quarter, and serve hot. 

Banana Cream Pie. 

Put a lump of butter in a basin and warm it together with a little crushed loaf- 
sugar, the yolks of two or three eggs, a little milk and sherry or angelica, and 



7 oo COLD DESSERTS. 

some pulp of bananas mashed thoroughly. Pour the mixture into a deep dish, stir- 
ring in the well-whipped whites of a couple of eggs; place the dish in a moderate 
oven and bake until done, taking care not to bake too quickly. Then remove and 
serve. 

Cherry Pie. 

Remove the stones from the necessary amount of cherries and then scald the 
fruit in their own juice, sweeten well, and pour into a- deep pie-dish lined with a rich 
paste. Dredge with flour, cover with a top crust of the same paste, ornament the 
edge, and put in the oven to bake. 

Cocoanut Pies. 

Pour one cupful of milk into a saucepan, boil and sprinkle in one tablespoonful 
of corn starch mixed with two tablespoonfuls of sugar; when these are incorporated, 
add a lump of butter, one pinch of salt and two ounces of grated cocoanut. Pour 
the mixture in a basin, let it cool, add the whites of four eggs beaten to a froth, put 
the mixture into pans lined with puff paste, and bake until done. 

Cocoanut Custard Pies. 

Put two eggs in a basin, beat them with two cupfuls of milk and four ounces of 
sugar, add one cupful of grated cocoanut and half a teaspoonful of extract of lemon. 
Put the mixture into a puff paste, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Cranberry Pie. 

Plunge one quart of cranberries into a pan of cold water, salted, and let them 
stand for twelve hours, when they will need to be washed in several waters to remove 
the salt flavor. Then take them out, drain and put on a cloth to dry. Pick them 
over carefully and put into a basin with four ounces of caster-sugar and the juice of 
half a lemon squeezed over them. Stir together well and, if thought desirable, add 
a wineglassful of any white wine. Fill up a pie-dish with the fruit, cover over the 
top with a light paste, put the pie in the oven, and bake until done. Sprinkle over 
powdered sugar, and serve either hot or cold. 

Cream Pie. 

Mix one-half pound of sugar, three tablespoonfuls of flour, one quart of milk, 
and the yolks of half a dozen eggs together, and put them into a saucepan; season 
with a little wine, grated nutmeg, lemon or vanilla, and boil the mixture for twenty 
minutes. Prepare some rich pastry, line a shallow dish, bake lightly and fill up with 
the cream, then bake again until it is quite done. Take a little sugar and some of the 
whites of the eggs and make a meringue, pour it over the pie, and put into a hot 
closet or warming-oven to brown lightly. 



COLD DESSERTS. 701 

Currant Pie. 

Prepare the currants by removing the stalks, leaves and any unsound fruit; place 
them in a dish with sufficient caster-sugar to sweeten, and pour over a little boiling 
water. Put the dish in the oven to simmer for a few minutes, then take it out and 
cool. When the fruit is cold, pour it into a pie-dish, cover over with light puff paste, 
and bake in a moderate oven until done. 

Custard Pie. 

Line a pie-dish with crust; put six eggs into a bowl, and beat until quite light, 
then add two ounces of finely-powdered white sugar and a pint and a half of milk, 
and mix well; put this into the dish and bake in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. 
Take it out and grate a little nutmeg over the top. If it is to be served cold, stand 
it in cold water in a cool place, because if it does not cool at once the crust gets 
soaked and spoiled. 

Fruit Pie. 

Mix half a tablespoonful of arrow-root with a little cold water until smooth and 
put it into a lined saucepan with one pint of juice from any kind of canned fruit, 
sweeten to taste with powdered sugar, and stir it over the fire with a wooden spoon 
until boiling and thickened. Put about two breakfast cupfuls of canned fruit and 
juice into a pie- dish and pour the thickened juice over it. Put one teacupful of well- 
washed rice into a saucepan with a pint and a half of milk, and boil it until reduced 
to a pulp. Beat two eggs with three tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar, and stir 
them in with the rice when it is cooked. Spread the rice out onto a dish and leave 
it until cool, then work it up with a little flour; mould it into a flat cake that will just 
fit in the pie-dish, lay it on top of the fruit, brush it over with a paste-brush dipped 
in beaten egg, and bake in a brisk oven until browned. It may be served either hot 
or cold. 

Gooseberry Pie. 

Line the edges of a deep pie-dish with rich puff paste, fill the dish with cleaned 
and picked gooseberries and put half a pound of moist sugar with them; pour in a 
little water, cover the pie with more puff paste moistening the edges so they will 
stick to the undercrust, cut it evenly all round, make a slit in the top with a knife, 
and bake in a moderate oven. When cooked take it out, sprinkle powdered sugar 
over, and serve with a good custard. 

Lemon Pie. 

( I.) Mix two tablespoonfuls of corn starch with one breakfast cupful of hot water, 
pour it into a stewpan, and stir over the fire until boiling. Then mix in the grated 
rinds and juice of two lemons and three-fourths of a pound of powdered sugar ; when 



702 COLD DESSERTS. 

cool stir in the yolks of four well-beaten eggs, line some buttered plates with a good 
rich crust, pour the mixture in, and bake until the crust is done. Beat the whites of 
two eggs together with six tablespoonfuls of sugar, and when very light and frothy 
pour it over the pies, place them in the oven again, and bake till slightly browned. 
Serve either hot or cold. 

(2.) Make a good paste, and line a deep pie-dish with it. Stir together the 
following : The grated rinds and juice of two lemons, one breakfast cupful of finely- 
chopped raisins, one teacupful of cracker-dust, one breakfast cupful of boiling water, 
and one and one-half breakfast cupfuls of sugar. Stir all these ingredients in a 
saucepan over the fire until they boil, and then fill the dish with them; put an upper 
crust on the pie, wetting the edges to make it adhere, brush the surface with beaten 
eggs, make two or three little cuts in it, and bake in a moderate oven until well- 
browned. 

Lemon-Cream Pies. 

Line some small buttered plates with a good short paste, and bake until lightly 
browned. Boil one pint of milk, then put with it one teacupful of powdered sugar ; 
mix together the grated rind of half a lemon and two tablespoonfuls of flour, pour 
over a little of the milk gradually to form a thick paste, then mix all together and 
whisk it over the fire. When the flour is cooked, add the juice of half a lemon, a large 
lump of butter, and four well-beaten yolks of eggs, continue stirring over the fire, 
but be careful to remove it before the eggs curdle. Pour the cream into the plates 
of crusts, and serve when cold. 

Mince Pies. 

Prepare some puff, short or tart-paste, and ro41 it on a floured table to the thick- 
ness of one-fourth of an inch. Butter some large pie-plates and line them with the 
paste; fill each one with mincemeat, cover with rounds of the paste, trim round the 
edges, moisten and press them together. Bake for about thirty minutes in a brisk 
oven. Beat the whites of two or three eggs to a stiff froth; take out the pies when 
cooked, dip a paste-brush in the beaten egg, and brush them over with it. Sprinkle 
sugar over each and place them in the oven again to glaze for two or three minutes. 
Arrange the pies on a folded napkin placed on a dish, garnish with sprigs of holly, and 
serve while they are very hot. 

Lemon Mince Pies. 

/

crack them and put the kernels in with the fruit. Decorate the sides of a cylinder- 
mould with blanched and split sweet almonds, using a small quantity of liquid jelly 
to make them adhere, and then carefully pour in layers of the prunes and jelly. Put 
the mould in ice and leave it until the contents are quite firm. Sweeten some cream 
to taste with powdered sugar, flavor it with a few drops of essence of almonds, and 
then whip it to a stiff froth. When the jelly is ready, dip the mould into hot water, 
wipe it and turn the contents out onto a glass dish, fill the hollow up with the cream, 
and serve.

currants and pistachios, fill the outer part with clear, nicely-flavored jelly and stand it 
in a cool place. Pour one pint of milk into an enameled stewpan with a stick of 
vanilla and loaf-sugar to taste, boil until well flavored, and dissolve one-half ounce 
of isinglass in the milk. Beat the yolks of four eggs into a basin, and stir the flavored 
milk gradually in with them. Strain the custard- into the stewpan, and stir it at the 
side of the fire for a few minutes, but without boiling it, then let it cool. Move the 
lining of the mould and fill the hollow with alternate layers of sponge-cakes and 
macaroons, strewing between each layer a few chopped candied fruits. Pour in the 
custard and stand the mould in a cool place, or on the ice until the custard is firm. 
When ready, dip the mould into hot water, wipe it, and turn the pudding out onto a dish, 

Gelatine Pudding. 

Put a quarter of an ounce of gelatine in half a teacupful of cold water, let it remain 
until soft and then add boiling water to make the quantity up to half a pint. Beat up 
the yolks of three eggs in a basin, mix in three tablespoonfuls of sugar and a little 
salt to make a custard. Pour this into a double boiler, add one pint of boiling milk 
and boil until it thickens. Pass the gelatine water through a fine strainer into the 
double boiler with the custard, and add a teaspoonful of vanilla extract and the whites 
of three eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Dip six small moulds into cold water, pour in 
the mixture and pack them in pounded ice to harden. Turn them out of the moulds 
on a glass dish, and serve with wine or other sweet sauce. 

Lemon Jelly Pudding. 

Prepare one quart of lemon jelly, pour part of it in a mould holding two quarts, 
making a layer about one-half inch thick, then stand it on ice and leave till set. Cut 
some candied cherries in two, arrange them on the top of the set jelly, pour in two or 
three tablespoonfuls of cold liquid jelly to hold the cherries, then pour in enough jelly 
to cover them. When the jelly is perfectly set, put a mould holding one quart in 
the center of the large one, and fill the intervening space with jelly. Fill the small 
mould with ice, and set both in a basin of ice and water. When the jelly is again 
hard, take the ice out of the smaller mould, fill it with warm water and lift it out care- 
fully. Fill the cavity left by the small mould with the lemon sponge, and let it stand 
until hard. Turn the pudding onto a fancy dish, pour a lemon-flavored custard round 
it, and serve. 

Maraschino Pudding. 

Dissolve three ounces of gelatine in one breakfast cupful of water; beat the yolks 
of ten eggs with one quart of milk, pbur them into a lined saucepan, and stir them 
over a slow fire until they are thickened, but do not let it boil or the eggs will curdle; 
then stir in the dissolved gelatine, and when it is somewhat cooled add one wineglass-

small quantity of water, then mix in by degrees one pint of boiling milk; sweeten 
with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and turn it into a saucepan. Stir the cornstarch 
over the fire with a wooden spoon, and boil it for five minutes; then move it to the 
side and stir in two ounces of butter broken into small pieces. When the butter has 
dissolved put in, one at a time, the yolks of four eggs, and beat them well. Butter a 
round pie-dish, put in one pint of canned peaches, and pour the cornstarch over them. 
Place the pudding in a brisk oven and bake for from twenty-five to thirty minutes. Beat 
the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth together with two heaping tablespoonfuls of 
sugar. When the pudding is cooked, spread over the egg mixture, raising it to a 
point in the center, and return it to the oven for four or five minutes to set the 
meringue. When cooked take the pudding from the oven and place it away until 
quite cold. Then decorate it with candied fruits .and angelica, serve on a flat plate, 
and surround it with a colored paper frill. 

Peach Pudding. 

Peel twelve ripe peaches and cut them in pieces, put them in a basin, sprinkle fine 
sugar over and let them stand for an hour. Put one and one-half pints of milk in a 
double boiler. Before preparing the peaches put one ounce of gelatine or isinglass 
in a teacupful of milk and let it soak for an hour. Stir four beaten eggs with two 
tablespoonfuls of finely-powdered sugar and the gelatine in the milk when boiling, 
and continue stirring for four or five minutes. Take the double boiler off the fire 
and mix with the custard a little salt and one wineglassful of Madeira. Put the 
peaches in a glass dish, and when the custard has partly cooled pour it over and leave 
them for a few hours before serving. It is better, if possible, to make this pudding 
the preceding day. 

Princess Pudding. 

Put two ounces of French gelatine into a large basin with one pint of cold water 
and let it soak for an hour or a little more; then pour over one pint of boiling water, 
stir it well, and while doing so add three breakfast cupfuls of moist sugar, the strained 
juice of four lemons and one pint of Madeira or Malaga wine. Pour the mixture into 
a saucepan over the fire, and when it commences to thicken add the whites of four 
eggs previously beaten to a stiff froth. Turn the whole into a Princess mould packed 
in ice, and when it is set and firm turn it out onto a dish and serve with one quart of 
rich custard poured round it. The dish may afterward be garnished with crystallized 
fruits, macaroon, ratafias or other sweet fancy biscuits.

interior of a mould with crystalized cherries and orange chips and pour in the mix- 
ture. Pack the mould in pounded ice and leave it for an hour or two. When ready 
to serve, dip the mould into warm water, wipe it and turn the contents onto a fancy 
dish. 

Rhubarb with Meringue. 

Cut the rhubarb into short lengths, put it in a saucepan with a small quantity of 
water and stew it gently until it is tender; then mash it together with about one 
pound of moist sugar and stir it over the fire for about ten minutes longer; then turn 
it into a pie-dish. Whisk the whites of two eggs to a firm froth with one tablespoon- 
ful of powdered sugar, spread it over the rhubarb and put it in a brisk oven until 
lightly browned. Serve while hot. 

Boiled Rice and Cream. 

Pour one pint of cold milk into a saucepan, add one pint of cold water, and one- 
half saltspoonful of salt, and place the pan on a hot range; when boiling, throw in 
four ounces of well-cleaned raw rice, and with a spatula stir slowly and constantly at the 
bottom for twenty-five minutes while it is cooking. Take the pan from the fire, and 
add immediately four ounces of powdered sugar and one ounce of butter, and mix 
well together with a spatula for two or three minutes. Transfer the mixture into an- 
other vessel, and stand it in a cold place for one hour. Whisk to a stiff froth one 
pint of rich cream, cover the basin with a napkin, and let it stand for twenty minutes; 
should there be any milk settled at the bottom, pour it off, and add to the cream two 
ounces of powdered sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring; then with a wire 
whisk beat together for two minutes longer; take the rice from the vessel, drop it 
gradually into the whipped cream and mix the whole slowly and carefully together 
for three or four minutes. Line a two-quart melon-shaped mould with three ounces 
of peach marmalade, fill the mould with the preparation, place on the cover, and after 
putting a little broken ice at the bottom of the pail, lay in the mould and cover care- 
fully and entirely with broken ice, and freeze for one hour. Have ready a vessel with 
two quarts of lukewarm water, lift up the mould from the pail, dip it into the water, 
wash off the ice and raise it up immediately, remove the cover, turn the preparation 
onto a cold dish, and send it to the table.

cooked, flavor slightly with essence of vanilla, move the rice away from the fire, and 
let it cool. Place the beaten yolks of four eggs in a stewpan with one teacupful of 
milk, stir them over the fire until thickened but not boiling, and leave until cold. 
When the custard and rice are both cold, mix them well together. Whip one-fourth 
pint of cream to a firm froth, having previously sweetened it with powdered sugar, 
and mix with it one-half ounce of isinglass that has been dissolved in a small quantity 
of warm water. Stir the cream in lightly with the rice, put the mixture into a mould, 
and pack it in ice. Cut up some apricots (canned ones will answer), into halves, re- 
move the stones, put them in a stewpan, cover them with syrup, and allow them to 
simmer gently until tender. Drain the apricots and keep them in a cool place. 
When ready to serve, dip the mould quickly into hot water, wipe it, turn the rice onto 
a glass dish, and arrange the apricots round it. 

Lemon Snow. 

Put one ounce of gelatine in a saucepan with a little water, and place it over the 
fire until it has dissolved, then add one-half pound of sugar and the juice of six 
lemons. Stir the mixture and boil it for ten minutes, then strain through a jelly-bag 
into a basin. Whip the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, and when the jelly is cold 
and is commencing to thicken, mix them in and whisk until light. Leave the pud- 
ding to get cold, garnish with ratafias, and serve. 

Orange Snow. 

Soak one ounce of gelatine in three gills of cold water for four hours, then add 
to it the grated rind of half a lemon, the grated rind of an orange, the strained juice 
of one lemon and four oranges, and eight ounces of powdered white sugar, stir well 
together, and let the mixture stand for an hour. Add a pint of boiling water and 
continue stirring till clear; then strain it through a coarse cloth and wring it thor- 
oughly. Beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, and when the liquid is quite 
cool whisk them into it by degrees, and continue whisking till quite thick and white. 
Wet the inside of a mould with cold water, and pour the snow into it. Let it stand 
in a cool place for eight hours at least before turning it out, then pile it up on a glass 
dish, and garnish it round with sweet biscuits. 

Lemon Sponge. 

Soak one ounce of gelatine in one teacupful of water for two hours. Pour the 
juice of four lemons on one breakfast cupful of powdered sugar; beat the yolks of 
four eggs, and mix them with the remains of one pint of water allowing for the quan- 
tity used to soak the gelatine, add to this the sugar and lemon, and cook in a double 
boiler until it begins to thicken, then put in the gelatine. Strain all through a fine 
hair-sieve into a basin, stand the basin in a larger one containing iced-water, and whisk 



710 



COLD DESSERTS. 



now and then until the sponge has cooled but not hardened. Beat in the whites of 
the eggs not previously beaten, and continue beating until the mixture is so thick that 
it is difficult to stir it, then turn it into a mould and set it away to harden. When 
ready to serve, dip the mould in tepid water, wipe it, and turn the contents onto a 
dish. Serve with powdered sugar and cream. 

Peach Sponge. 

Strain the juice from a can of preserved peaches and pass the fruit through a fine 
hair-sieve, then beat it up with the juice and a small quantity of sugar. Put one ounce 
of isinglass in a basin with one-half pint of cream, let it steep for some time, then 
stand the basin in a stewpan containing boiling water, and stir the contents until the 
isinglass has dissolved. Mix the fruit pulp with the cream and stir it, out of the 
water, until nearly cold. Whisk the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, stir them in 
with the cream, and pile it up high in the center of a glass dish. Select several small 
thickly-berried sprays of holly and brush each leaf carefully over with a strong solu- 
tion of gum arable, strew powdered sugar over and leave them until dry. Arrange 
the sprays of holly round the sponge, and serve. 

Strawberry Sponge. 

Pick the stems from one quart of strawberries, mash and mix one teacupful of 
powdered sugar with them. Put one teacupful of crushed loaf-sugar in a saucepan 
with one-half pint of water and boil it gently for twenty minutes, then mix with it 
one ounce of gelatine that has been soaked for two hours in a teacupful of water, and 
remove it from the fire at once, Pass the strawberries through a fine hair-sieve and 
mix them with the syrup. Stand the bowl containing the above mixture on ice, and 
beat it for five minutes, then add the whipped whites of four eggs and continue beat- 
ing until the mixture begins to thicken. Turn the sponge out of the moulds onto 
fancy dishes, dust a little powdered sugar on the top, pour a little whipped cream 
round, and serve. 

Stewed Apples. 

Great care should be taken in the selection of the apples to avoid those which 
"fall" easily. The cores should be removed before peeling and the apples placed in 
sufficient water to cover them. A little spinach green may be placed in to flavor and 
color. When the apples are yet whole, but are transparent, they may be carefully 
lifted out with a strainer and placed on a glass dish. The centers should then be 
filled with red jelly, and the tops masked with apple or orange marmalade. The 
water they were boiled in should be reduced by simmering until quite syrupy; it may 
then be colored with a little cochineal and flavored with lemon, and then poured 
around the dish.

a saucepan with a pint of cold water in which half a pound of sugar has been dis- 
solved, and add the juice and the thin rind of a lemon. Set the saucepan at the side 
of the fire and simmer gently for an hour, by which time the fruit should be tender 
enough to mash readily. Remove the prunes and drain them; then put the saucepan 
with the syrup in it over the fire, and boil it to the degree at which it is on the point 
of resolving itself into sugar. Put the prunes in a shallow dish, pour the syrup over

with a liberal sprinkling of white sifted sugar on it. 

Apple Tart and Custard. 

Place a border of rich puff-paste around the pie-dish and put in some apples 
pared, cored and cut into thin slices; sprinkle over them a little sugar and grated 
rind of lemon. Mix a little lemon-juice with some water, pour it over the apples and 
cover with a crust of paste. Place in the oven, baking for about three-quarters of an 
hour, then remove and with a sharp knife cut away all the inside of the crust, leaving 
merely the border. Pour over the apples a little boiled custard, grate over a little 
nutmeg and allow the tart to cool, and serve. 

Apple Open-Tart. 

Place 'the quantity of apples to be used in a saucepan after peeling, coring and 
slicing them, and add a little sugar and water together with a small quantity of 
lemon-peel and grated nutmeg. Cook gently until the apples are quite tender, then 
put the mixture in a basin to cool. Cover a shallow pie-dish lined with rich puff- 
paste with the mixture to a depth of about half an inch. Then place on top more of 
the paste rolled out into strips running from side to side to the edge of the crust. 
Trim and bake in a moderate oven until done, which is known by the crust being 
easily separated from the dish. Turn out carefully onto another dish, and serve.

about two ounces of butter over it in little pieces, fold over, and leave again for half 
an hour, then beat the paste again with a rolling-pin, dust it over with a little more 
flour, and roll it out. Butter a tart-dish, line it with the paste and pour in the pre- 
pared cream, using the trimmings of the paste to make a rim to the tart and strips 
across. Brush the paste over with a feather or a fine brush dipped in the beaten yolk 
of an egg, and bake in a quick oven. Serve either cold or hot.

Roll out eight ounces of puff paste twelve inches long by eight inches wide, cut 
it in six pieces with a cutter, arrange them on six scalloped tart-pans three and one- 
half inches wide, and press down the paste at the bottom and sides so as to have the 
impression of the moulds, but without touching the rim, which will rise considerably 
when baked. Mask them with three ounces of apple marmalade equally divided; 
on top of this put half a large pear, dust them over with pounded sugar, put them on 
a baking-sheet and bake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. Bring them to the 
oven door, dust the edges over lightly with more powdered sugar, melt this in the

stoned, dust over with powdered sugar and bake for twenty minutes in a moderate 
oven; bring them to the oven door, dust the edges over with powdered sugar, melt 
this for a couple of minutes in the oven and take out the tarts, let them cool and turn 
them out of the pans. Then mask them with a little apple-jelly and serve on a nap- 
kin spread over a dish. 

Roman Tartlets. 

Put the whites of half a dozen eggs into a whipping-bowl and beat them to a 
froth; add by degrees one-half pound of powdered sugar and after this is worked in 
add one dessertspoonful of corn starch. Great care must be observed in adding the 
latter, otherwise the pastry will be tough and useless; the beating must stop and the 
cornstarch only stirred in. Cover a tin or baking-sheet with oiled paper; on this 
place as many small rings as will be required, also lined with oiled paper, make them 
hot, pour two tablespoonfuls of the mixture into each ring, place them in a moderate 
oven, and as they are baking make an indentation in each with the back of a spoon.

Lemon Ice-Cream. No. 2. 

Boil one pint of water together with the strained juice of three lemons, and one 
and one-half breakfast cupfuls of powdered sugar for twenty minutes. Beat the yolks 
of eight eggs, and one pinch of salt; pour the syrup in a basin, and stand it in a larger 
one containing hot water. Stir the yolks of the eggs into the syrup and beat rapidly 
for three minutes. Remove the basin from the boiling water, place it in 'a pan of 
ice-water, and beat until cold. Add the cream, pour all into a freezer, and work 
until frozen. 

Macaroon Ice-Cream. 

Dry six ounces of macaroons in the oven. Remove them to the table to cool, 
place them in a mortar, pound, sift thoroughly, and lay a sheet of paper over ; have 
ready a vanilla ice-cream, add it to the sifted macaroons, and mix them thoroughly 
with the spatula for five minutes, and with this fill a three-pint mould and cover it 
tightly. Have a pail ready with room for broken ice and rock-salt at the bottom, lay 
the mould in and fill up the pail with more ice and salt. Let it freeze for two hours 
and when it is ready to serve, dip the mould into warm water, turn the cream out onto 
a fancy dish, and serve right away. 

Maraschino Ice-Cream. 

Place two quarts of cream in a pan on the fire. Whisk the whites of two eggs to 
a froth, then add the yolks of eight eggs beaten up with one pound of powdered 
white sugar ; stir them lightly together, and when the cream boils, add to it by 
degrees, whisking all the time. Place the mixture over the fire and let it boil two 
times, still whisking ; then run it through a sieve. When it is cold mix it with 
three liqueur glassfuls of Maraschino, place in a freezer, cover, and freeze it. 

Orange Ice-Cream. 

Put the rinds of two oranges rubbed off with three-fourth pound of sugar into 
a saucepan, add the yolks of eight eggs, the juice of six oranges, and a little salt, 
stir well over the fire until the mixture thickens, working it briskly ; then pour it into 
a mould packed in ice, freeze, and when wanted turn out onto a dish, and serve very 
cold. 

Neapolitan Ice-Cream. 

Make one pint of vanilla ice cream, one pint of raspberry water ice and one pint 
of pistachio ice cream. Take a long brick-form mould, holding three pints, put the 
raspberry water ice at the bottom, arrange the vanilla cream on top, and fill up with 
the pistachio, and cover tightly. Set the mould on broken ice, mixed with rock salt,

cream on a piece of paper laid on the table. Dip a long knife in warm water, cut the 
brick lengthwise through the middle, divide each piece into three, so that the 
Neapolitan will then be in six equal-sized pieces, each having the three kinds of 
cream. Dress on a cold dish, with a fancy paper on top, and serve. 

New York Ice-Cream. 

Put into a saucepan three breakfast cupfuls of milk, one-fourth pound of gelatine, 
ten tablespoonfuls of sugar, and set the saucepan at the side of the fire, where the milk will 
heat up by degrees, and thus give the gelatine time to dissolve; stir frequently from the 
bottom until the milk boils, add a vanilla bean. Pour a little more milk in a bowl, 
together with the yolks of ten eggs, whisk them well, pour the boiling milk over, and 
strain into a freezer. The vanilla bean may be wiped and put away to be used another 
time. When the custard has become cold, and has begun to freeze, whisk the cup of 
cream to froth, stir it in, and finish the freezing as usual, working the cream until it is 
twice its original bulk. It is then ready for serving. 

Nougat Ice-Cream. 

Put the nougat in a mortar with two tablespoonfuls of orange-flower water, and 
pound it. Put the yolks of three eggs in a saucepan with one and one-half pints of 
cream, and twelve tablespoonfuls of fine sugar and beat. Mix the bruised nougat 
and three drops of the essence of peach-kernels with the milk and eggs, and stir the 
whole over the fire till on the point of thickening. Pass the mixture through a fine 
hair-sieve into a basin and leave till cooled. When ready turn the nougat cream 
into the "freezer and freeze it. The cream can be served as it is or may be turned into 
moulds and packed in ice for about two hours. Before serving, the mould should be 
dipped in warm water, wiped, and the contents turned out on a fancy dish. 

Nut Ice-Cream. 

Beat well the yolks of seven or eight eggs in a saucepan and add gradually 
about twelve ounces of sifted crushed loaf sugar, working it to a froth with a wooden 
spoon, then pour in one pint of boiling milk and add one stick of vanilla to flavor. 
Pour the cream into a basin and add six tablespoonfuls of nuts blanched and pounded 
to a paste with a few blanched sweet almonds. Let the preparation cool, pass it 
through a fine hair-sieve into a freezer, and when frozen it is ready for use. 

Peach Ice-Cream. 

Peel six ripe peaches and boil them in one-fourth pint of water till dissolved; 
pass the pulp through a fine hair-sieve, then mix with it one pint of syrup, one pint 
of thick cream, a few drops of essence of kernels, and color it lightly with a little

cleaned and pounded, add three-quarters of a pound of crushed loaf sugar and the 
yolks of eight eggs, a little salt and three breakfast cupfuls of cream (or milk), 
place over the fire and stir it well until quite thick; then rub it through a fine hair- 
sieve into a basin and add a tablespoonful of orange-flower water to flavor, two table- 
spoonfuls of spinach green to color and turn all into the freezer, and when it becomes 
thoroughly frozen it is ready for use. 

Plombiere Ice-Cream. 

Put into a stewpan one and one-half pints of milk or cream, fourteen ounces of 
caster-sugar, six ounces of ground sweet almonds and fifteen bitter ones (previously 
well pounded with one tablespoonful of orange-flower water), three ounces of apricot 
jam diluted with one teacupful of water, and the yolks of eight eggs, and place the 
pan over the fire, stirring constantly; when the mixture begins to get thick take it off 
and pass it through a fine sieve into a basin. Pour the preparation into a freezer, 
twisting the pan vigorously, and sometimes working with a knife or spatula. When 
the mixture is nearly stiff, add the whites of two Italian meringues and work well 
again, add last of all one-half pint of well-whipped cream. It can either be turned 
out onto moulds, or served on a dish with a folded napkin. Heap it up in layers with 
apricot jam between, surrounded at the base with some almond cakes.

it is completed mix in one breakfast cupful of well-whipped cream, three ounces ot 
sliced pistachios, and the same quantity of finely-minced candied orange-peel. When 
it has frozen sufficiently, it is ready to be served. 

Punch Ice-Cream. 

Make about one-half teacupful of strong green tea, strain it when cold, mix with 
it one pint of rich cream, and add two wineglassfuls of rum and the strained juice of 
half a lemon. Sweeten the cream to taste, pour it into a freezing-pot, work it until 
well frozen, then pack it in a mould, and bury it in pounded ice and salt for an hour. 
When ready to serve the mould must be dipped into hot water, wiped quickly, and 
then turned out onto a hot dish. 

Ratafia Ice-Cream. 

Put eight ounces of crushed ratafias into a saucepan, pour over two breakfast 
cupfuls of ratafia cream, add the yolks of half a dozen eggs and a little sugar, and stir 
well over the fire until the mixture is quite smooth and has the appearance of custard. 
Pass it through a fine wire-sieve into a freezer, work well, turn it into a mould packed 
in ice, and let it stay there until required. The ratafias should be crushed as fine 
as possible. 

Sherbet Ice-Cream. 

Beat up very lightly the yolks of three eggs with one tablespoonful of orange- 
flower water, then mix in by degrees one quart of cream. Turn this into a saucepan 
over the fire, cover over, and as quickly as it boils strain it through a sieve, and mix

cream, and more sifted sugar if required. Turn the preparation into the freezer, work 
it well, place it in a mould packed in ice, let it set, then turn it out, and it is ready 
for use. 

Vanilla Ice-Cream. 

Mix thoroughly together one quart of nice fresh cream, a well-beaten egg and 
one pound of powdered white sugar; add one-fourth of a vanilla bean cut into pieces, 
place it over the fire in a saucepan and keep it stirred constantly till on the point of 
boiling; then remove it from the fire and strain it through a fine sieve. When cold 
place it in a freezer and stir until well frozen. Repack the freezer with ice and let 
the ice cream remain well covered until frozen. 

Vanilla and Chocolate Ice-Cream. 

Make some white vanilla and some chocolate cream, separately, but make them 
both of the same consistency. Brush a mould lightly over with oil, rest it slantingly 
on the ice and pour in a small quantity of the vanilla cream. When that is frozen 
alter the position of the mould and pour in some of the chocolate cream. When 
this is frozen proceed as before until the mould is full, changing the position of the 
mould each time sometimes leaning to one side and again to another in regular 
intervals. Then pack the mould in pounded ice for two hours, or till wanted; 
dip the mould into warm water, turn the contents onto a raised dish, and serve. 

Vanilla and Strawberry Ice-Cream. 

Pour one and one-half pints of thick cream into a saucepan with a pod of vanilla 
and boil it. Put one-fourth pound of sugar into a saucepan with the yolks of six 
eggs and beat them together; then pour in the boiled cream and stir it over the fire 
until thick, but do not allow it to boil or the eggs will curdle. When thick pass the 
mixture through a fine hair-sieve into a basin. Mix one pint of syrup at 35 degrees 
with one pint of strawberry puree, stirring well together; then pass it through a silk 
sieve. Turn the vanilla cream into an ice-mould and the strawberry mixture into 
another, pack them both in pounded ice and salt, and work the contents with a spatula 
until smooth and frozen. Cut a piece of cardboard to fit the center of an ice-mould 
and place it in perpendicularly, dividing the mould into two equal parts; fill one side 
with the vanilla ice and the other with the strawberry ice, remove the piece of card- 
board and pack the mould in ice and leave it for two hours. When ready to serve, 
dip the mould in warm water, wipe it, turn the contents out onto a folded napkin, and 
serve. 

Walnut Ice-Cream. 

Blanch and skin one-half pound of walnut kernels, place them in a mortar with 
a scant tablespoonful of orange-flower water, and pound them until quite smooth, 



73 2 ICE-CREAMS AND ICES. 

adding by degrees one-half teacupful of milk. Turn the mixture onto a wire-sieve 
and rub it through with a wooden spoon, having a basin underneath to catch it. Mix 
three-fourths of a breakfast cupful of milk with the walnuts and one-half pound of 
fine sugar. Stir well, add one and one-half breakfast cupfuls of thick cream, turn the 
mixture into a freezer and work it well. When frozen, pile the cream on a glass dish, 
or in small glasses, and serve at once. 

Wine Ice-Cream.

white wine and sufficient syrup or sugar to sweeten, and freeze in a freezer. Stir in a 
little chopped preserved mixed fruits, turn the cream into a mould packed in ice, let 
it set, and turn it out on a cold dish for use. 

Ice Cups. 

Pack one dozen flat champagne glasses or small tumblers in a tub with pounded 
ice and salt around them; a little brine at the bottom of the tub is also advisable. Fill 
these glasses with any fruit syrup, such as raspberry, strawberry, or cherry, cover the 
tub with a cloth and leave for fifteen to twenty minutes, so that the syrup will be 
frozen about an eighth of an inch in thickness all round the sides of the glass. Pour 
out the unfrozen syrup and replace the glasses in the ice for a few minutes longer, 
in order to thoroughly set the inside of the syrup case; turn these ice cups out care- 
fully and fill the cavity with Curacoa ice cream, nut ice-cream, or any ice of a differ- 
ent color from the cups, and serve. 

Lemon Granite Ice. 

Mix one pint of filtered lemon-juice with three pints of syrup at twenty-eight 
degrees and freeze it into icicles in a freezing-pot. The granite should be served in 
small glasses.

sugar, then pour in a pint and a half of milk and stir the mixture over a slow fire 



ICE-CREAMS AND ICES. 733 

till it thickens and is on the boiling point; remove it at once, for if it is allowed to 
boil the eggs will curdle; pass the cream through a fine hair-sieve into a basin, and 
stir until it has cooled. Put a half-pound of sugar into a small pan, and stir it over 
the fire until it has boiled to a dark brown. Stir in one teacupful of water with the 
caramel, and boil it a few minutes longer. Whip the cooled mixture over ice for 
about ten minutes, then gradually mix in the caramel and four teacupfuls of whipped 
cream. Pour the mixture into a dome-shaped mould, put a sheet of paper on the 
top, and close the lid; then pack it in pounded ice and salt. The mousse should be 
kept for at least one hour in the ice. Dip the mould in milk-warm water, wipe it, 
and turn the mousse out onto a folded napkin or an ornamental dish-paper that has 
been placed on a dish, garnish with small sponge-cakes decorated with dried cherries, 
and serve. 

Chestnut Mousse. 

With one-half pound of chestnut puree mix about six ounces of sugar flavored 
with vanilla, beat it well with a spoon until it is quite smooth, and then add three 
wineglassfuls of sweetened whipped cream. Pour the preparation into a dome-shaped 
mould previously buried in salted ice, cover the mould, solder its joints with flour and 
water paste, and keep it in the ice for one hour. When ready to serve, dip the mould 
in hot water, wipe, and turn the mousse out on a folded napkin. 

Charlotte Mousse. 

Soften three cakes of chocolate. When soft work the chocolate to a paste with 
a little syrup flavored with vanilla; warm and add the white of one egg whipped and 
sweetened, and a pint and a half of whipped cream, flavored with vanilla sugar. Pack 
a quart mould in pounded and salted ice, fill, put a cover on, lay ice on the top of 
that and leave for an hour, then unmould onto a dish. 

Strawberry Mousse. 

Pick the stems from one pound of freshly-gathered ripe strawberries, pass the 
fruit through a fine hair-sieve into a preserving-pan, mix with it a few tablespoonfuls 
of vanilla sugar and set the pan on the fire, stirring constantly until the puree is well 
mixed. Move the pan from the fire, set it on pounded ice, and stir until the contents 
are cold. Mix a few tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar with one and one-half pints of 
cream, flavor with a little essence of vanilla, and whip it well. Mix the cream with 
the puree. Line a dome-shaped mould with white paper, fill it with the above mixture, 
place a round of paper on the top, and place the lid on the mould, solder the open- 
ings with butter, and pack the mould in pounded ice. When ready to serve, dip the 
mould in cold water, wipe it, and turn the contents onto a folded napkin laid on a

Alexandria Iced Pudding. 

Place two breakfast cupfuls of milk or cream in a saucepan with the yolks of 
four eggs and sugar to the taste, and stir them into a custard; next turn this custard 
into a basin, and when it becomes cold, mix in four ounces of ratafia cakes, broken in 
pieces, and rubbed through a sieve, and flavor with two or three drops of extract of bitter 
almonds; pack the basin in ice, and freeze until the mixture has been reduced to the 
freezing-point. Place a layer of this iced mixture at the bottom of a mould, and on 
top of this arrange a few strawberries preserved whole, and from which the syrup has 
been thoroughly drained, having dipped them, one at a time, into lemonjuice. Con- 
tinue to put in layers, as above, until all the ingredients are used, then return the 
mould to the ice, and let it remain there for a couple of hours, turn the pudding 
out onto a dish, and serve. 

Iced Cabinet Pudding. 

Cut in slices of" moderate thickness some sponge-cakes, also some preserved 
pineapple, ginger, apricots and pears, all in equal quantities. Fill a plain pudding-

until about half frozen, then turn the pudding onto a fancy dish, pile the frozen sauce 
around it, and serve. 



Punch in Surprise. 



Have six different fancy moulds, resembling in shape an apple, pear, banana, 
tomato, pineapple and peach. Fill a tin pan with ice well mixed with rock salt, lay 
on it the six moulds, opened flat, fill them with cold water, also the pan to half its 
height, and let them remain for half an hour, feeling the interiors of the mould to 
ascertain whether a crust adheres to them. Have in readiness any kind of punch; 
take up each mould separately, empty out the water, fill one after another with the 
punch, close tightly, and lay them in a pail previously prepared with broken ice and 
rock salt at the bottom; cover with a liberal allowance of extra ice and salt, and let 
them freeze for an hour. Have ready a cold dish with a folded napkin over it; pour 
some warm water into a vessel, take up each mould separately, dip it into the water 
and quickly wash off any ice or salt that may adhere; turn them out carefully, place 
them on a dish and send to the table. 



ICE-CREAMS AND ICES. 



Kirsch Punch. 



737 



Put in a dish one-fourth pound of powdered sugar with one pint of cold water, 
grate in the rind of a small lemon, squeezing in the juice of one and one-half good- 
sized ones, and beat well together with the spatula for five minutes; add one gill of 
kirsch, mix a little more, and strain through a sieve into a freezer. Place the lid on 
and lay it in an ice-tub, filling the freezer all around with broken ice mixed slightly 
with rock salt, and turn the handle as briskly as possible for two minutes. Lift up 
the lid and with a wooden spoon detach the punch from the sides and bottom 
of the freezer. Re-cover it and turn the handle briskly for three minutes more; un- 
cover again and detach the punch the same as before, being careful that no ice or 
salt drops in. Put the lid on and repeat the same operation three times more. When 
ready, serve in half a dozen small punch glasses. 

Maraschino Punch. 

Put one pound of sugar in a basin with one quart of water and add the juice of 
a lemon and an orange and one breakfast cupful of maraschino. When it is well 
mixed strain it into a freezer again, when it will be ready for use. 

Roman Punch. 

Pour into a freezing-pot one quart of peach water-ice, a bottle of dry champagne, 
two wineglassfuls of noyau, and the strained juice of four oranges. Color it a delicate 
pink with a few drops of cochineal, and flavor with essence of vanilla. Work the 
mixture until almost frozen, then add gradually the whites of three eggs made into 
Italian meringue; work all together quickly until smooth, and then serve. 



Strawberry Punch. 



Pick the stems from one quart of freshly-gathered ripe strawberries, put the fruit 
into a deep dish, cover them with two and one-half breakfast cupfuls of sugar, and 
leave till a thick syrup has formed. Pass the strawberries and syrup through a fine 
hair-sieve into a freezer and mix with them one teacupful of sweet wine and one and 
one-half breakfast cupfuls of water; stir until mixed, and leave until frozen. Serve 
the punch in small glasses. 

American Sherbet. 

Secure some tin moulds to imitate high-shaped wineglasses, fill them with pure 
cold water, close them securely, and pack them in pounded ice. In the meantime 
mix in equal quantities some fruit syrup, wine and orange or lemon juice; almost any 



738 ICE-CREAMS AND ICES. 

kind of fruit syrup may be used. Pour the mixture into a freezing-pot and work it 
well until frozen. The sherbet must not be frozen too firmly, yet it must be consist- 
ent enough to be piled up in pyramids in the ice glasses. When the water has frozen 
enough to take the form of the moulds, turn it out carefully, drain out any liquid that 
has not frozen, and fill up the ice glasses with the frozen syrup, piling it up high. 
Stand the glasses on a fancy dish and pass them round. If desired, the water may 
be colored before being frozen in the moulds, and a different color may be used in 
almost every mould; this will have a very pretty effect when served. 

Carnot Sherbet. 

Have in readiness an orange water ice, in which mix a little carmine, kirsch and 
orange-flower water. It should be dressed in a small nest with a little bird perched 
on its edge; the bird, the inside and the bottom should be made of gum paste, and 
the outside of the nest should be imitated with spun sugar and the grass with fillets 
of angelica. It should be served immediately on its completion. 

White-Cherry Sherbet. 

Remove the stems and stones from four breakfast cupfuls of large ripe white 
cherries, put them in a mortar, pound thoroughly so as to break the stones, and strain 
the juice into a freezer. Put the pulp into a saucepan with one teacupful of sugar 
and one breakfast cupful of water, and boil for a few minutes, in order to extract the 
flavor from the kernels, pass the mixture through a sieve into another saucepan and 
add one breakfast cupful of water and sugar. Boil for a minute or two, let the mix- 
ture cool, pour it into the freezer with the juice, add the whites of two eggs whipped 
to a froth, and the sherbet is then ready for use. A few whole cherries which have 
been cooked in syrup may be added to the mixture while it is still in the freezer. 

Cream Sherbet. 

Thoroughly beat one ounce of caster-sugar into one pint of cream and the whites 
of six eggs previously beaten to a stiff froth. Dissolve one more ounce of caster- 
sugar in three quarts of water and pour this upon four lemons sliced thin; mix 
thoroughly with the other, strain, and put it into a freezer until ready for serving. 

Kirsch Sherbet. 

Mix one quart of syrup at 35 degrees with the same quantity of chablis, and 
pass it through a silk sieve into a freezer. Beat well with a spoon, and when well 
frozen add one-half teacupful of kirsch, mix again, put into the glasses, and serve. 



ICE-CREAMS AND ICES. 739 

Lemon Sherbet. 

Pare one lemon thin, and squeeze in the rind of two, taking care to keep back 
the pips. Mix with it four tablespoonfuls of loaf sugar and one breakfast cupful of 
water. When the sugar has dissolved pour in two breakfast cupfuls of water. Strain 
and use. It may be iced or not, as desired. 

Orange Sherbet. 

Put a tablespoonful of gelatine in a little cold water to soak, and then pour over 
one breakfast cupful of boiling water to dissolve it. Turn it into a basin with the 
juice of ten large oranges, and add two breakfast cupfuls of sugar, and three of 
water. Mix well and when quite cold it is ready for use. The juice of a lemon may 
be added if the oranges are too sweet. 

Pineapple Sherbet. 

Soak a tablespoonful of gelatine in a couple of tablespoonfuls of cold water for 
two hours; peel a large pineapple, cut out the eyes and discolored parts and chop 
fine, mixing with it two breakfast cupfuls of caster-sugar. Dissolve the soaked 
gelatine in half a pint of boiling water, then stir this and half a pint of cold water in 
with the pineapple; pour the whole preparation into a freezer and freeze. When 
done, the sherbet should be white and creamy, 

Strawberry Sherbet. 

Remove the stems from one pound or so of strawberries, mash the fruit, mix with 
it the juice of a lemon, one tablespoonful of orange-flower water, and three pints of 
water. In the course of four hours' time strain the juice off the strawberries into 
another basin, pressing them to extract as much juice as possible. Mix with the juice 
one pound of double-refined sugar, and stir it until the sugar has dissolved ; then 
strain it and pack it in ice for an hour. 

Sherbet, Waldorf Style. 

Put two pounds of sugar and one quart of water into a saucepan and boil it to a 
syrup. Put four ounces of stoned raisins into a basin with five ounces of chopped 
figs, half a dozen cloves, and a small piece of cinnamon. Pour the syrup over the 
above ingredients, and leave it till cool. Strain and color the syrup a delicate pink 
with a little prepared cochineal, add the juice of six oranges, two lemons and a small 
quantity of cinnamon, three or four cloves and one quart of port wine. Turn the 
mixture into the freezer and freeze it. When frozen take the cloves and cinnamon 



740 ICE-CREAMS AND ICES. 

out of the mixture, add the scalded raisins and figs, one-half pound of muscatel 
grapes, and one-fourth pound of blanched almonds. When well incorporated the 
sherbet is ready for use. 

Sherbets with Champagne. 

Mix one-fourth pint of champagne with one pint of syrup, and add the juice of 
one lemon and two sweet oranges, also the thinly-peeled rind of the lemon. In a 
quarter of an hour strain the mixture through a fine hair-sieve and give it eighteen 
degrees at the syrup scale (see Sugar Boiling). Turn the sherbet into a freezer, and 
work it with a spatula until set ; then mix with it by degrees one-fourth pint more of 
champagne that has been stirred in with a little syrup. Serve the sherbet in ice 
glasses. 

Souffle Ices. 

Pour one pint of syrup, at thirty-two degrees, in a basin, and stir into it the yolks 
of fifteen or eighteen eggs; strain this into a copper egg-bowl made a little warm by 
pouring hot water into it and wiping dry afterward; add to this one breakfast cupful 
of maraschino, the same quantity of filtered strawberry-juice and one pinch of salt. 
Whisk lightly but briskly, with the bowl standing about six inches deep in very hot 
water, and when like creamy batter remove it from the hot water and continue to 
whisk for about ten minutes longer. Place a souffle case in ice, stir in three-fourths 
of a pint of whipped cream to the mixture, and pour the whole into the case. Place 
a wide strip of cartridge-paper round the case and about one and one-half inches 
above it, so as to give the souffle plenty of room to rise like an ordinary souffle. 
When set and firm turn it onto a cold dish, sprinkle with finely-powdered and brown- 
baked Savoy biscuits, and serve. 

Vanilla and Chocolate Souffle, Iced. 

Put the yolks of sixteen eggs in a basin with one teacupful of clarified syrup and 
one breakfast cupful of water; beat together, then pass it through a fine hair-sieve. 
Turn the mixture into a saucepan and stir it over a slow fire until it forms a thick 
custard, but do not allow it to boil. Pour some boiling water in a bowl to warm it, 
then turn it out; pour the custard into the bowl, stir in one teaspoonful of vanilla 
flavoring and whip it for several minutes; then stir in one pint of whipped cream and 
pour all into a souffle-mould. Pack it in ice for two hours, put a layer of chocolate 
on top that has been melted in iced water, and leave for two hours longer. Serve 
the souffle in the mould. 

Souffle Ice-Cream with Brandy. 

Mix one-fourth pint of brandy with two whites of Italian meringues and add one 
pint of the very best cream and three ounces of ginger comfits. Stir these well 



ICE-CREAMS AND ICES. 741 

together, put them into a mould embedded in finely-pounded ice mixed with salt and 
saltpeter, and let it freeze. When quite firm, turn it out of the mould, and serve. 

Souffle Ice-Cream with Maraschino. 

Mix one teacupful of maraschino with two whites of Italian meringues when they 
are quite cold. Add one pint of well-whipped cream, and the kernels of eighteen 
walnuts (the walnuts should be picked before they are quite ripe, and the skins 
removed from the kernels). See that they are thoroughly incorporated with the other 
ingredients, and then pour the preparation into a mould, which should be mixed with 
salt and saltpeter and packed in well-pounded ice. When frozen, turn out, and serve. 

Souffle Ice-Cream with Meringue. 

With the yolks of six eggs, one and one-half teacupfuls of pineapple syrup and a 
stick of vanilla, make a custard. Mix this with two whites of Italian meringue and 
one-half teacupful of noyau or maraschino, and then stir in thoroughly one pint of 
well-whipped cream, and finally two ounces of chocolate pastilles, and one-fourth of 
a pound of pineapple cut up very small. When well mixed together pour into a 
mould and place on the ice to freeze. When firm, turn it out, and serve. 

Souffle Ice-Cream with Vanilla. 

Take two whites of Italian meringue, and when they are cold mix them with one 
ounce of vanilla sugar, and a pint of thoroughly whipped cream. Place a mould on 
the ice and pour in the mixture; then cover the mould and place it in pounded ice 
mixed with salt. When hard, turn out, and serve. 

Tutti Frutti. 

This is the Italian for all sorts and kinds of fruit. The name is applied to a 
great variety of fruit dishes, ices, etc., as will be seen by the following recipes: 
Line the interior of a three-pint lemon-shaped mould with one pint of vanilla cream. 
Cut four ounces of candied apricots into small pieces, also four ounces of candied 
cherries into halves. Mix these well together. Spread half the quantity of the 
fruits evenly round the cream in the mould and pour one pint of raspberry water ice 
all round the fruits. Arrange the balance of the fruits round the water ice and fill 
the mould with one pint of pistachio cream ice. Cover the mould tightly, place it in 
a pail with a layer of broken ice and rock-salt at the bottom; fill up to the top with 
the same and put it into a freezer. Freeze for an hour and a half. Turn out the 
tutti frutti on a glass stand and serve with the following sauce: Put in a basin one 
pint of whipped cream with two ounces of sugar and one gill of maraschino. Beat 
the whole well together for two minutes. Pour it over the tutti frutti, and immediately 
send it to the table. 



742 ICE-CREAMS AND ICES. 

Apple Water Ice. 

Peel and core the required number of apples, cut them into quarters and place 
in a saucepan; set the pan over a fire and cook until tender. Pass them through a 
very fine sieve over a basin, rubbing as much through as possible and mix with water 
highly flavored with lemon. Pack the basin in ice, and when the mixture is frozen 
it is ready for use. 

Apricot Water Ice. 

Stew for a few minutes some well-chopped apricots and the peeled kernels of 
half that quantity in a little sugar and water. Rub the fruit with the back of a spoon 
through a strainer into the freezer and mix in the syrup. Freeze, and when it is 
nearly set, whip the whites of two or three eggs to a froth, mix them in and turn the 
freezer rapidly a short time longer. Cut up a few very ripe apricots and stir them 
into the ice before serving. Canned apricots may be used if fresh ones are not avail- 
able, and if preserved in syrup that will answer for mixing with them, or the liquor 
can be made into a syrup by boiling it with a proper proportion of sugar. 

Red Cherry Water Ice. 

Wash one quart of sweet red or black cherries, pound them so as to break the 
stones, and pass the juice through a strainer into a freezer. Boil the cherry-pulp 
with some of the sugar and water, in order to extract the flavor from the kernels, and 
pass that also through the strainer. Add the other pint of water and the remainder 
of the sugar to the amount of three-quarters of a pound and freeze. Do not use the 
whites of eggs in this ice, as the color is not good unless frozen naturally. This 
makes a nice ice for the third color in a Neapolitan. 

Lemon Water Ice. 

Rub off the peels of six lemons onto one-half pound of loaf sugar, place it in a 
basin, and strain the juice of the lemons over; with this prepare a syrup, using four 
or five breakfast cupfuls of water and another pound of sugar. Strain, and then add 
the whites of four eggs, wMl-beaten together, with one ounce of powdered sugar. 
Place it in the freezer, and work as required. 

Madeira Water Ice. 

Grate the peel of two lemons into a basin, strain in the juice, mix in one and 
one-half pints of Madeira wine and one-half pint of syrup. Stir well, and then turn 
it into a freezer, pack it in pounded ice and salt, and work vigorously until frozen. 
When sufficiently so, put the mixture into a mould, close, and pack it in pounded ice 



ICE-CREAMS AND ICES. 743 

and salt for two hours. Before serving dip the mould in warm water, wipe it, then 
turn the contents carefully out onto a fancy china or glass dish. 

Melon Water Ice. 

Pound eight ounces of ripe melon in a mortar and add two ounces of orange- 
flower water, the juice of two lemons, one breakfast cupful of water and a pint of 
clarified sugar. Stir the mixture thoroughly and strain through a fine sieve, put in a 
freezer, and it is ready for use. 

Orange Water Ice. 

Put the juice of four oranges and the grated rinds of three into a basin with one 
breakfast cupful of water, add the juice of three lemons and one pint of syrup, stir 
well, then pass it through a fine sieve into a mould, pack it in ice, freeze (see Ices), 
and when quite set turn it out onto a dish, and serve. 

Peach Water Ice. 

Slice ten ripe peaches but do not peel them, boil till soft in one-half pint of 
water, then rub them through a fine hair-sieve. Mix with the pulp one pint of syrup, 
the strained juice of one lemon, three or four drops of oil of almonds, and color it 
with a little carmine or cochineal. Put the preparation in the freezer, turn it till 
frozen, then fill a plain mould with it, put the lid on and pack it in ice. When ready 
to serve, turn the contents of the mould onto a fancy dish. 

Pear Water Ice. 

Peel a few ripe pears and grate them into a basin; mix with them eight ounces 
of powdered sugar, the strained juice of two oranges and one lemon, a little of the 
peel and two tablespoonfuls of vanilla sugar. Leave it for half an hour, then pass 
the preparation through a fine hair-sieve, mix a little cold water with it and freeze it 
in the ice box. When firm take the ice up with a large spoon and pile it like a 
pyramid on a folded napkin. Put some little fancy cakes round the dish, and serve. 

Pineapple Water Ice. 

Cut into halves a rather small pineapple, reserving one-half for future use; pare 
the other half neatly, cut it into small pieces and place them in a mortar, pounding 
them thoroughly to a pulp, say for about ten minutes. Then add half a pound of 
powdered sugar and again pound for five minutes, place the whole of this mixture in 
a vessel, squeeze in the juice of three lemons, pour in a quart of cold water, mix 
thoroughly with a spatula for two minutes, and strain through a fine hair-sieve into 



744 ICE-CREAMS AND ICES. 

the freezer, adding the whites of a couple of eggs, beaten to a stiff froth, and beat 
well for a minute or so longer, and freeze. 

Pistachio Water Ice. 

Place six ounces of blanched pistachios in a mortar and pound them to a pulp, 
adding a little water to prevent them from oiling, turn this preparation out into a 
basin, and mix in with it one pint of lemon water ice, passing all through a fine hair- 
sieve into a freezer, then turn out into a mould well packed in ice, and when it has 
become thoroughly frozen and set, it is ready for use. 

Raspberry Water Ice. 

Place in a basin one-half pound of powdered sugar, squeeze in the juice of three 
lemons, and add one pint of picked and well-cleaned raspberries. Beat briskly with 
a spatula for five minutes, add one quart of cold water, mixing again for a minute or 
two, and strain through a sieve into the freezer. Put on the lid and lay the freezer 
in an ice-tub, filling it all round with broken ice, mixed with a small quantity of rock 
salt. Turn the handle on the cover as rapidly as possible for three minutes. Raise 
the lid, and with a spoon detach the cream from all round the freezer and the bottom 
also. Remove it, and turn the handle again sharply for three minutes more. Un- 
cover and detach the cream as before, taking care that no salt or ice drops in it. 
Place the lid on, and repeat the operation three times more. By this time the cream 
should be quite firm, turn it out onto a cold dish, over which has been spread a napkin, 
and serve. 



Strawberry Water Ice. 



Pick one and one-half pounds of strawberries, put them into a basin with a little 
sifted crushed loaf sugar and the juice of a lemon, pass the whole through a fine 
hair-sieve into another basin, stir in three teacupfuls of syrup and a few drops of 
cochineal to color, turn the preparation into the freezer, work it thoroughly, and it is 
then ready for use. 

Vanilla Water Ice. 

Pound sufficient vanilla beans in a mortar to flavor one quart of water. Pour that 
quantity of water into a saucepan with the pounded vanilla and one-half pound of 
loaf sugar. Boil the ingredients together, then strain the mixture through a fine hair- 
sieve; squeeze in the juice of one lemon, put it in the freezing-pot, and freeze. 



Pastry. 

Almonds. 

The kernel of the almond nut is largely used in cooking and confectionery for its 
delicate flavor. There are two kinds, sweet and bitter, so closely resembling each 
other in appearance as to be almost indistinguishable, excepting by the taste. The 
sweet variety are harmless, but the bitter almonds contain or generate by fermenta- 
tion, prussic acid, rendering them extremely dangerous to use without much discre- 
tion. A hundred grains of bitter almond pulp are said to contain two drops of the 
oil, and from fifteen to thirty drops of the oil are sufficient to cause death. The skins 
of both kinds are very indigestible, and have been known, even when eaten in small 
quantities, to induce attacks of nettle-rash. For this reason almonds should 
invariably be skinned or blanched before using. 

The best almonds are the Jordan, imported chiefly from Malaga, and preferred 
for dessert. They are of two kinds; the one above one inch in length, flat with a 
clean brown skin, sweet, mucilaginous, and rather tough; the other more plump, 
pointed at one end, brittle, but quite as sweet as the former. Valencia almonds are 
reckoned of the second quality; they are cheaper, and consequently are more used. 
They are under one inch long, round at one end, and bluntly pointed at the other, 
flat and of a dingy-brown color, and have a dusty skin. Barbary and Italian almonds 
are smaller and less flattened. Spanish almonds are of mediocre quality, and are 
usually imported in baskets. When fresh, either kind may be used; but cooks 
strongly recommend not to buy kernels of any kind if they are dry, broken, worm- 
eaten, or smell in the least degree rancid. 

To Blanch Almonds: The almonds should be thrown into a pan of boiling water, 
and allowed to remain over the fire until the skins will slip off readily when rubbed 
between the finger and thumb. It is well then to drain them off, and to plunge them 
into cold water for a minute or two, when they may be drained again, and the skins 
rubbed off with a cloth. As they are blanched, throw them into cold water, with a 
little salt in it; leave them for a couple of hours, then take them out and dry them. 
They are easily split with a knife, or may be cut lengthwise into long shreds, accord- 
ing to the purpose for which they are required. 

To Color Almonds: Whether the almonds are whole, shredded or chopped, it is 
only necessary to rub them together with the coloring matter until they are saturated; 
they should then be dried in a screen. 

To Pound Almonds: It is better after blanching to let them soak for an hour or 
so in cold water, which will prevent them in a measure from " oiling." A few drops 

745 



74.6 PASTRY. 

of water, orange-flower water, or lemon-juice, should be added now and then for the 
same purpose, as the pounding proceeds. When reduced to a softish pulp, they are 
ready for use. 

Almond Croquettes. 

Take an equal quantity each of flour, almonds and sugar, the zest of two or three 
oranges rasped on lumps of sugar, two or three whole eggs, and an extra yolk or so. 
Scald the almonds and remove their skins, afterwards soaking for two hours in cold 
salt and water. Pound them thoroughly in a mortar, with a few drops of orange- 
water added to prevent oiling, until reduced to a pulp; then mix in the remainder of 
the ingredients by pounding all together. Knead the paste with a little flour on a 
slab, roll it with a bit of flat-board into the shape of a straight rolling-pin, lay this on 
a greased baking-board, and cover it over, baking in a moderate heat until done, then 
while hot, cut it up into slices, and dry on a baking-sheet in a very slow oven. After 
they are dried, moisten their edges with royal icing, dip them in finely-chopped 
pistachio kernels, and dry them for a few minutes. 

Baba. 

Sift four pounds of dried flour onto a marble or slate slab, put a quarter of it into 
a basin, and pour in the center one ounce of German yeast dissolved in a teacupful of 
warm water. Mix well with the fingers, adding a little more water if required to make 
a stiff paste. Roll into the shape of a ball, and again place in the basin, score it on 
top in the form of a cross, set in a warm place, and let the dough rise for about ten 
minutes, or until it is quite light. Make a cavity in the center of the three pounds of 
flour, adding two and a half pounds of butter, slightly warmed, half an ounce of salt 
and half a teacupful of water, together with fifteen eggs. Work the eggs and butter 
well together, then mix the whole into a paste, keeping it rather soft. In a few min- 
utes, add six more eggs singly, and work lightly with the hand for ten minutes, 
sprinkling a teaspoonful of powdered saffron over the dough, and mixing it in. Put 
four ounces of Smyrna and eight ounces of Malaga raisins, together with four ounces 
of cleaned currants, and a small quantity of mixed candied peels cut into thin slices 
into a basin, pour over a breakfast cupful of Madeira wine and three wineglassfuls of 
brandy or rum, whichever may be preferred, and let these ingredients soak for a few 
minutes. Then mix them all in with the paste, using the hand lightly, and allow it 
to stand for a few minutes. Put a strip of paper about three inches above the rim of 
a well-buttered mould, pour in the mixture to about three-quarters the height of the 
mould, and set it in a warm place, and when the paste has risen to the top of the 
mould, place in a slack oven and bake until done, say about three hours. Turn out 
carefully onto a sieve, and serve either hot or cold. Care should be taken not to 
have the paste too thin, or the fruit will fall to the bottom of the cake, and the effect 
will be lost. As the fruit in some cakes has a tendency to stick to the mould when 



PASTRY. 747 

cooked, the latter may be masked with a coating of plain paste before placing the 
mixture in it. 

Baba with Madeira. 

Prepare a baba cake as described in the foregoing, but do not glaze it. Slit the 
cake into halves and remove the top piece. Pour a little cold water into a clean pan, 
adding a little sugar and lemon, and place it on the stove, boiling well for three min- 
utes; then remove and at once add a gill or so of good sherry wine and half that 
quantity of curaoa. Lay the top part of the cake in a flat-bottomed vessel a wire 
basket is recommended, to avoid breaking it, as it can be carefully lowered into the 
pan. Pour the prepared sauce gradually over it, and let it stand for a couple of min- 
utes, then replace carefully on top of the other half of the cake. Arrange tastefully 
on a dessert-dish, garnish with candied cherries, the border being decorated with 
candied pineapple. 

Baba with Vanilla Cream Sauce. 

Prepare a baba cake as previously described, and when removed from the mould 
and laid on a dish, cut it into six equal parts. Take a small quantity of apricot mar- 
malade, taking one piece of the cake in the hand and cover the sides where cut with 
the marmalade, spreading it smoothly with a knife. Then arrange the six pieces to- 
gether on a dish, giving them the same form as before. Serve with vanilla cream 
sauce. 

Almond Biscuits. 

Blanch and pound an equal quantity of bitter and sweet almonds, adding a few 
drops of orange-water to prevent them from oiling. Beat the yolks of some eggs in 
a little powdered sugar, add the almond pulp and sufficient flour to form a stiff paste, 
and roll out to one-quarter of an inch in thickness. Cut into shapes with a pastry- 
cutter or the rim of a wineglass, and bake on a greased baking-sheet until a light 
brown. 

Almond Sponge Biscuits. 

Crack a dozen eggs separately into a teacup, pour them all into a large kitchen- 
basin, and beat with a whisk until thoroughly mixed; then add by degrees a pound 
and two ounces of sugar, and beat until it is quite dissolved. Then add a pound and 
three ounces of fine pastry-flour, and work into a light dough. Have ready sufficient 
small moulds, warm them and butter the inner surfaces neatly. Fill level to the rims 
with the dough, dust over the top with powdered sugar, lay them over some blanched 
chopped almonds, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Champagne Biscuits. 

Mix the desired quantity of flour with some caraway seeds, beat up a dozen eggs 
to each two pounds of flour used and add gradually powdered sugar while beating 



74 8 PASTRY. 

until a thick paste is formed; warm some butter and beat it to a cream, so that when 
the sugar and eggs are well thickened this butter may be worked into them, and add 
gradually some finely-sifted flour and some more of the caraway seeds. Lay the 
biscuits on a greased paper which has been crinkled and set them with the papers 
into small tin moulds, and bake in a hot oven. 

Chocolate Biscuit. 

Put the yolks of eight eggs in a basin with half a pound of caster-sugar, mix 
in six ounces of flour and beat until the batter is quite smooth. Beat the whites of 
the eggs to a light froth and stir with the foregoing and season the mixture with a 
few drops of vanilla. Put an ounce and a half of chocolate in a saucepan on the fire 
and when dissolved put in three tablespoonfuls of sugar and stir until thick. Dip the 
cold biscuit in the chocolate and lay on a dish. 

Cream Biscuits. 

Put one-half pound of flour in a basin, form a hollow in the center and work in 
the whites of three eggs, one-half teacupful of cream, one ounce of sugar, one wine- 
glassful of brandy and a small quantity of salt. When it is quite smooth roll out the 
paste very thin, cut it into rounds with a cutter two inches in diameter, prick them 
all over with a fork, put them on a floured baking-sheet and bake in a hot oven until 
done. Turn them out, let them get cold, and use as desired. 

Orange Biscuits. 

Put eight ounces of butter into a basin, warm and work it to a cream, adding the 
same quantity of orange sugar. Chop into thin slices three ounces of candied orange 
peel, mix it in, and add gradually four ounces of dried flour and the well-beaten 
yolks of eight eggs. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, stir them in, pour 
the mixture into well-buttered moulds, sprinkle over a little powdered sugar and bake 
in a slow oven for five or six minutes. Turn them out when done, let them get cold, 
and they are ready for use. 

Pistachio Biscuit. 

Have ready two basins and put the whites of a dozen eggs in one and the yolks 
in the other; mix with the yolks a pound of sugar, four ounces of blanched pista- 
chios powdered to a pulp, adding a little white of egg to prevent them from oiling. 
The whites should then be whisked to a froth and turned into the basin with the 
yolks and pistachios, sifting in about six ounces of dried flour and the rasped rinds of 
a couple of lemons. Stir gently, and pour the mixture into moulds or paper cases, 
sprinkle well with caster-sugar, place in a moderate oven and bake. When done, allow 
them to get cold and they are ready for use. 



PASTRY. 749 

Raspberry Biscuits. 

Put one pound of sifted, crushed loaf sugar into a basin with an equal weight 
of blanched and pounded sweet almonds, add a small quantity of grated lemon-rind, 
and sufficient yolk of egg to form a stiff paste. Roll half of this out very thin, 
cover it with a layer of raspberry jam, place the balance of the paste on the top, and 
allow it to stand for a day. Cover the top with royal icing, cut up into strips about 
three inches long by one inch in width, place them on a baking-sheet on a moderate 
oven, and bake until done. Take them out and serve them when cold. 

Vanilla Biscuits. 

Beat the yolks of half a dozen eggs with one-half pound of finely-powdered 
sugar and a small quantity of grated lemon-peel. Beat the whites of six eggs to a 
stiff froth and stir them lightly in with the beaten yolks ; dredge in one-half pound 
of flour, and flavor with a little essence of vanilla, and then work it until quite 
smooth. Lay the mixture out in rounds on foolscap paper, using a biscuit-forcer 
for the purpose; dust them over with vanilla sugar, and bake in a quick oven. 
When cooked, take the biscuits and join them together in pairs. 



Walnut-and-Jam Biscuits. 



Pound fifty walnuts in their skins, and pass them through a fine wire-sieve. 
Slightly warm one-fourth pound of butter, and beat it until creamy, together with one- 
half pound of sugar, then beat in the yolks of two eggs, and one whole one, and one 
wineglassful of rum. Put one-fourth pound of flour into a basin, and add the beaten 
mixture, stirring it until quite smooth. If too thin, more flour may be added to the 
paste, but it should not be too stiff. Butter a shallow baking-tin, spread the paste 
over it, bake in a moderate oven, and when done, spread a layer of any kind of jam 
over it; then put it in the oven again for six or seven minutes. Beat the whites of 
two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and a small quantity of ground 
cinnamon to a firm froth, then mix with them the powdered walnuts. Spread the 
walnut mixture over the top of the cake, and leave it in the oven until lightly 
browned. When cooked, leave the cake until cold; then cut it into squares or 
diamond-shaped pieces, and pack them away in biscuit tins, placing a sheet of white 
paper between each layer. They will keep for some time. 

Wine Finger Biscuits. 

Warm two ounces of butter, and beat it to a cream, with two tablespoonfuls of 
caster-sugar and one tablespoonful of orange-sugar; add one wineglassful of Madeira 
wine and a little salt, then stir eight ounces of flour in the mixture, and work till 
smooth. Dust some flour over the table, and roll the paste out very thin; cut it into 



750 PASTRY. 

long thin fingers, which prick all over with a fork. Dust some flour over a baking-

one pound of white flour and a grating of nutmeg. Knead this together for some 
time, cover it with a cloth and set it in a warm place; then cut up the mass into 
small pieces about the size of an apple, roll them round in the hand to prevent them 
sticking and then roll out each ball on a floured paste-board to an oval about one- 
third to one-half inch in thickness. Cut with a floured knife three parallel slits in 
the middle of each, but not through at the ends, cross the two slips with your fingers 
and draw up the two sides between. Put your fingers through and drop each wonder 
into a dish of boiling lard. Thev will rise as they are done and can then be turned 
so as to brown them all over equally. Remove them with a fork and lay them on a 
drainer or folded paper to drain. A slight sprinkling of powdered sugar improves them.

Ladies' Bouchees. 

Place a small quantity of paste in a pastry-bag. Butter well and flour a baking- 
sheet, and form a sufficient number of small round biscuits the shape of macaroons, 
sprinkle lightly with powdered sugar and place in a brisk oven and bake for twelve 
minutes. Then take out to cool for fifteen minutes. Lift from the pan, lay them 
upside down on a table, and make a small cavity half an inch in diameter in each, 
filling with the cream. Fasten them together two by two, to enclose the cream, and 
they should then be ball-shaped. Then they may be dipped carefully and separately 
into a thick sugar icing and laid on a pastry grating to dry for fifteen minutes. Dress 
on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin or ornamental dish-paper, and serve. 

Raspberry Ladies' Bouchees. 

Put the yolks of half a dozen eggs into a basin and beat them up with one-half 
pound of sifted crushed loaf sugar, working them well for about five minutes. Add the 
whites of the eggs whipped to a stiff broth, and mix in four ounces of flour. Turn 
the mixture into a biscuit-forcer or paper funnel, squeeze out rounds about one and 
one-half inches in diameter, letting them fall on sheets of paper, sprinkle them over 
with powdered sugar, and bake them. When done take them out, mask half of them 
with raspberry jam, cover with the other half, glaze them with raspberry icing, by 
dipping them into it, holding one at a time on a skewer, drain, place them in a hot 
closet for two or three minutes, take them out, and when cold they are ready for use. 

Lady Cake. 

Take one pound of caster-sugar, half a pound of flour, half a pound of butter, the 
whites of fourteen eggs, and mix well together. Flavor with two drops of oil of 
bitter almonds and bake on a buttered tin. 

Lady Fingers. 

Prepare the desired quantity of flour and butter in the following proportions : 
Half a pound of butter to every three pounds of flour, and rub well together, adding 
half a pound of fine sugar, with about thirty drops of essence of lemon; mix with 
milk into a firm dough, and place in a cloth for half an hour to settle before using. 
Beat with a rolling-pin until quite smooth, roll out thin and cut into strips, and cut 
.these strips into five-inch lengths. 

Leaf Cake. 

Blanch and pound one-half pound of sweet almOnds with half a dozen bitter 
ones; rub the yolks of eight hard-boiled eggs until quite smooth. Mix three-quarters 
of a pound of butter with a pound and a quarter of flour, and when quite smooth stir 



PASTRY. 763 

in the above ingredients with one-half pound of caster-sugar, three well-beaten eggs 
and a sufficient quantity of milk to make a consistent paste. Work the mixture 
thoroughly, then lay it on a paste-board on which some flour has been sifted, dividing 
it into six equal portions, and rolling them out very thin. Butter a baking-sheet, lay 
the cakes on it, brush them over with a paste-brush dipped in beaten egg, and bake 
to a light yellow in a slow oven. When cooked slip one of the cakes off the baking- 
sheet, cover it with a coating of any kind of preserve, place another cake on the top 
of that, coat that also with preserve, and so on till the last cake is on the top. Mask 
the top of the last cake with the finest white sugar icing, trim all evenly around the 
edges with a sharp knife, and serve when the icing is quite dry. 

Lemon Cake. 

Beat one-half pound of powdered sugar- together with the yolks of six eggs; 
when smooth add the whites previously whisked to a stiff froth, then stir in slowly 
seven or eight tablespoonfuls of flour and the grated peel of a large lemon. Line a 
cake-tin with buttered paper, pour the mixture in, and bake for one hour in a moder- 
ate oven. 

Lemon Cheese Cakes. 

Put four or five ounces of butter into a basin to melt, and work in four ounces of 
crushed and sifted loaf sugar. Then add the yolks of two and the whites of one egg, 
the finely-chopped peel of three and the juice of two lemons, one large crushed Savoy 
biscuit, a few pounded blanched almonds, and three tablespoonfuls of brandy. Line 
some patty-pans with puff paste, put a little of the lemon mixture in each, and bake 
in a quick oven. 

Lemon Puffs. 

Whisk the yolks of three eggs together with one-fourth pound of powdered 
sugar, then beat in three tablespoonfuls of milk, and sprinkle in a very little salt and 
the grated peel of a lemon; whip the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth and beat 
them in the above, and stir in finally one-half pound of flour. Pour the batter into 
muffin-rings, and bake in a quick oven. They should be baked immediately after the 
batter is mixed. 

Lemon Roll Cakes. 

Slightly warm two ounces of butter together with two ounces of powdered sugar; 
dissolve one tablespoonful of dry yeast in about one-half teacupful of warm milk, 
then mix it and the butter in one-half pound of flour, adding as much more warm 
milk as will be required to make a light dough. Beat the dough thoroughly and mix 
with it the grated peel of one lemon, a few pieces of finely-shredded lemon-peel and 
two well-beaten eggs. Divide this dough into two equal-sized lots, place them on a 



764 PASTRY. 

floured paste-board and mould them into long, thin rolls. Put them on a baking-sheet, 
set them in a warm place until risen, then bake in a slow oven. When cooked the 
rolls should be of a pale yellow color. Sprinkle lightly over with powdered sugar, 
and serve. 



Lunch Cakes, Large. 



Put into a basin two pounds of flour mixed with a half pound of moist sugar; 
form a hollow in the center, put in one tablespoonful of thick yeast, add a third of a 
breakfast cupful of warm milk not hot enough to scald the yeast, then stir in a little 
of the flour and let it rise for about forty-five minutes. Add another two-thirds of a 
breakfast cupful of milk warmed sufficiently to dissolve half a pound of butter, stir in 
one and a half pound of well washed currants, a small quantity of chopped peel, one 
teaspoonful of ground allspice, and the grated rind of a lemon. Pour the preparation 
into a well-buttered tin, set it to rise in a warm place, and afterward bake in a 
moderate oven. Turn it out when done, and serve cold. 

Macaroon Cake. 

Warm some butter, mix it with some sugar, work to a cream; beat in some 
eggs, add some milk, baking-powder, and enough flour so that you will be able 
to roll it. Work the dough thoroughly and put on a buttered baking-sheet. Place 
in a moderate oven, bake slightly, as it will have to be baked again when used 
for macaroon paste. 

Macaroons Flavored with Chocolate. 

Take half a pound of ground sweet almonds, add a quarter of a pound of slightly 
warmed chocolate and a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar; mix them to a stiff 
paste with the white of the eggs. Shape the paste into round balls, place them on a 
sheet of paper leaving a space between each, sift over some fine sugar, and bake in 
the oven until they are of a golden color. When they are done, take the paper out 
of the oven, dampen it a little so that they will be removed easily, and place the 
macaroons on a sieve until they are wanted. 

Macaroons Flavored with Coffee. 

Mix one pound of ground almonds and a pound and a half of sugar in a basin 
with a little extract of coffee, adding the whites of some eggs to form it into a paste. 
Place it on a wafer-paper in the shape of fingers and bake in an oven until they are 
of a light pale brown. Take them out when they are done, remove them by damp- 
ing, and place in paper-boxes until wanted. 



PASTRY. 765 

Macaroons Flavored. 

Beat the yolks of four eggs light together with one pound of powdered 
white sugar and whisk the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth. Beat into the beaten 
eggs and sugar the grated peel of one lemon and half a teaspoonful of grated nut- 
met. Mix in lastly and in small quantities the frothed whites and six ounces of flour. 
Roll the mixture into small balls, rub over with butter, lay them on a buttered-paper 
leaving a space between each, and bake in a hot oven. 

Macaroon Mirletons. 

Break into a powder enough macaroons to make three ounces in weight, place it 
in a basin with the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two, stir in four ounces of 
powdered loaf sugar, half an ounce of pounded candied orange-flowers and a small 
sprinkling of salt. Mix these for a few minutes; then add two ounces of warmed 
butter and the whites of two eggs whipped to a froth. Have some pans ready and 
line them with puff-paste, fill them with the mixture, dust them over with powdered 
sugar, let it melt in the oven, then dust over coarse sugar and bake to a light brown 
in a slake oven. When they are done, take out and serve them either hot or cold as 
may be required. 

Swiss Macaroons. 

Blanch and chop one pound of sweet and four ounces of bitter almonds, place 
them on a dish, mix with them half a pound of powdered sugar, and place them in a cool 
oven. When they are lightly browned place the almonds in a basin and mix with them 
a pound and a half more sugar, and enough of whisked whites of eggs to knead the 
whole into a paste. Spread a sheet of wafer-paper over a baking sheet, mould the 
above mixture into small, round cakes, dipping the finger in water to prevent them 
sticking, and lay the cakes on the paper. Leave a space between each cake as they 
will spread while baking. Place two thin fillets of almonds on each cake, brush them 
lightly over with a paste-brush dipped in water, and lay the cakes on the paper. 
When they are cooked leave the macaroons until they are cold, and then trim the 
paper off neatly round the edges with a knife. 

White Macaroons. 

Sift ten ounces of crushed loaf sugar into a basin, and mix in with a wooden 
spoon six ounces of blanched sweet almonds cut into shreds crosswise, four ounces 
of ground almonds, a small quantity of essence of noyau, and lastly the whites of 
two eggs. Make these into a paste, and with a spoon lay out small quantities about 
the size of walnuts, on sheets of paper, keeping them apart. Dip a finger in cold 
water, place it in the center of each macaroon to make them flat, then place on a 



766 PASTRY. 

baking-sheet in a moderate oven, and bake until they are lightly browned. Take 
them out and let them get cold before serving. 

Macaroons with Almonds. 

Blanch and pound smooth one-half pound of sweet and one-fourth pound of bit- 
ter almonds, adding a very little of the white of an egg to prevent their oiling. If 
they are then allowed to stand all night they will do so much the better. Beat the 
whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, adding gradually and in very small quantities three 
heaping tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; continue beating well, and stir in gradually 
one teaspoonful of mixed mace, nutmeg and cinnamon finely powdered, and one 
teaspoonful of rose water; then add also, by degrees, the pounded almonds. The 
mixture should be of the consistency of soft dough if too thick it will be heavy, 
and if too thin the cakes will run out of shape in baking; if it is not too thick, 
pound a few more almonds and stir them in. Butter a tin baking-sheet, flour the 
hands, take the dough up with a knife and work into balls; lay on a battered tin, 
bake to a pale brown. Have the oven hotter at the top than at the bottom. The 
macaroon should, in baking, rise in the middle, and the surface should crack. Split 
almonds laid on top before baking will improve the effect. 

Macaroons with Pistachio Nuts. 

Blanch and chop fine ten ounces of pistachios, place them in a basin with ten 
ounces of sifted crushed loaf sugar, a little essence of noyau, and the whites of two 
eggs. Lay out small quantities about the size of walnuts on wafer papers, keep them 
apart and with a moistened finger slightly press down the center so as to keep them 
round. Place them in an oven to bake. Serve when cold. 

Madeleine Cakes, Printaniere. 

Rub the rinds of two small lemons on a lump of sugar; crush it very fine with a 
roller, mixing three ounces of powdered sugar in with it. Put two ounces of this into 
a saucepan with two ounces of sifted flour, the yolk of one egg and two whole eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of brandy and half a saltspoonful of salt. Mix all together with a 
spatula, and in two minutes, when the paste is well mixed, stir it again for about a 
minute only. Place the saucepan containing the preparation on a very slow fire, stir it 
slightly to prevent its sticking to the bottom of the saucepan, and as soon as it 
becomes liquid take it off. Butter twelve small madeleine moulds, fill them with the 
preparation, lay them on a baking-sheet, and place them in a moderate oven for 
twenty minutes. Remove, let them cool, and take them out; cut a piece from the 
thinnest part of the top of each one to serve as a cover, and with a dessertspoon scoop 
out of each a cavity one inch deep. Put into a saucepan the yolks of eight eggs, one- 



PASTRY. 767 

half pound of powdered sugar, a piece of vanilla bean one inch long and split in 
halves, also one pint of sweet cream and six ounces of finely-grated cocoa. Stir well 
with the spatula for two minutes, place the pan on the hot stove, and stir constantly 
while it is heating; but under no conditions must it be allowed to boil. Remove it 
from the fire and place the pan in a cool place on the table for thirty minutes, strain 
it through a sieve into a freezer and freeze. Fill the cavity of each madeleine with 
this, replace the covers, lay them on a wire grating, and, with a brush, gently glaze as 
follows: Put into a saucepan one ounce of granulated sugar with one tablespoonful of 
cold water, and let it come to a boiling point; remove and immediately add two table- 
spoonfuls of strawberry juice, mixing well together, and sprinkle over with two ounces 
of well-chopped pistachios. Glaze the cakes with this and put them in the oven for 
one minute or more; dress on a dish with folded napkin, and serve. 

Madeleine Cakes without Butter. 

Put three eggs in a basin with a quarter of a pound of sugar and beat them until 
frothy, then mix in slowly three ounces of dried and sifted flour, and grate in a small 
quantity of lemon or orange peel. Grease some small madeleine moulds, fill them 
with the mixture, and bake in a slow oven. When the cakes are baked take them out 
of the moulds, and keep dry in biscuit tins until wanted. 

Meringue Cakes. 

Make a sponge cake of the following : Half a pound of finest caster-sugar and 
the whites of twelve eggs beaten together until the sugar is quite dissolved, then add 
a quarter of a pound of butter warmed to melting, one gill of milk, three-quarters of 
a pound of flour and one teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat these well and spread 
thinly on a greased baking-sheet. Put into a moderate oven, leave the door ajar, and 
bake. A board should be placed under the tin so that the bottom of the sheet will 
not bake too quickly. When nearly done cut into squares and cover each with 
meringue or icing made stiff. Place back in the oven for a few minutes, and then 
serve. Sifted sugar may also be sprinkled over the icing before returning to the 
oven to finish baking. 

Cream Meringues. 

Take the whites of six eggs and whip them to a white froth, and until they are 
very light and dry ; then mix in rapidly but gently one-half pound of caster-sugar. 
Take some paraffine-paper and spread it over three boards about nine by twelve 
inches in size; then, with a spoon, take the mixture out and drop it into oblong shapes 
on the paper to the number of about twelve on each piece. Place them in a warm 
closet to dry for two hours; then take them from the board, and remove the soft part 
with a spoon. Meanwhile take one breakfast cupful of cream, and season it with a 



768 PASTRY. 

little vanilla or one teaspoonful of wine, and one tablespoonful of caster-sugar. Whip 
it into a stiff froth, then fill the shells with it and join them together. The meringues 
must not be exposed to any great heat, or they will spoil. 

Maraschino Meringues. 

Put one pound of sugar into a saucepan, reduce it almost to the crack, and let it 
cool. In the meantime beat the whites of some eggs to a froth, and work them into 
the sugar, then add two tablespoonfuls of maraschino. Arrange equal-sized portions 
of the meringue on strips of paper, sprinkle with sugar and bake in an oven; as soon 
as the top part is set take them out, place two together with the moist part left in 
them, leave them in a hot closet to dry and they are ready for use. 

Mille-Feuilles Cakes. 

Roll out two pounds of rich puff paste, cut it into sixteen pieces marking each 
one in the center where a piece is to be removed, place them in a moderate oven, and 
bake. Take them out when done, lift off the centers, fill them with any kind of jam, 
replace the centers, pile the pieces one on top of another, and the cake is then ready 
for serving. 

Molasses Cake. 

Put seven or eight breakfast cupfuls of flour into a large basin and rub in until 
quite smooth one-half pound of butter; then mix with it one-half pound of sugar and 
two tablespoonfuls of ground ginger. Dissolve one tablespoonful of bicarbonate of 
soda in three tablespoonfuls of warm water, stir in with it one breakfast cupful of 
sour milk together with two breakfast cupfuls of molasses. Work the dough thor- 
oughly. If it is a little too stiff, more water can be added, or if not stiff a little more 
flour. Put the dough in a buttered cake-tin and bake in rather a quick oven. When 
cut, the interior should be quite dark. 

Nelson Cake. 

Roll out a pound and a quarter of puff-paste, cover it with a pound and a half of 
well-washed currants, half a pound of sugar and a little spice; sprinkle over a small 
quantity of water to make the currants and sugar bind, cover with another pound of 
rolled-paste, and bake. When done, ice it, let it stand awhile, and serve. 

New Year Cakes. 

Place one pound of powdered sugar and ten ounces of butter into a basin and 
beat them to a cream. Add three well-beaten eggs two ounces of caraway-seeds, 
one grated nutmeg and one pound of flour. When thoroughly mixed, stir in one 



PASTRY. 769 

pint of milk and one gill of rose-water and mix well again. Add two pounds more 
of flour and work the whole to a smooth dough. Roll it out, cut into cakes and 
bake in a moderate oven. Serve when cold. 

Nougatinas. 

Blanch and chop fine one pound of sweet almonds. Put two pounds of 
powdered white sugar and the juice of a lemon in a sugar-boiler over a moderate fire 
and stir until it boils, then add the almonds, stir them well in and pour the nougatina- 
paste on a well-oiled marble slab, forming it into an oblong cake one inch thick. 
Cut it in squares, and when cold, dip these in melted chocolate. 

Nut Cake. 

Warm one teacupful of butter in a basin, beat to a cream, and add gradually one 
breakfast cupful of sugar. When the mixture is quite light and frothy, stir in two 
well-beaten eggs, then a teacupful of milk, add two breakfast cupfuls of flour with one 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar and half a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda. Now 
work in quickly one breakfast cupful each of stoned raisins and blanched nuts very 
finely chopped, turn the mixture into well-greased deep baking-pans, and bake in a 
moderate oven for thirty-five minutes. Turn it out when done, and serve cold. One 
and one-half teaspoonfuls of baking-powder may be substituted for the cream of tartar 
and soda if preferred. 

Orange Cake (Large). 

Sift three-fourths of a pound of flour on a paste-board, cut eight ounces of butter 
into small pieces, lay them on the flour and work them in; add four ounces each of 
sugar and blanched and pounded almonds, the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs that 
have been rubbed through a fine sieve, three well-beaten eggs, and sufficient milk to 
form a smooth paste. Knead the paste until all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, 
and then roll out as thin as possible without breaking. Cut it to a round shape, 
lay it on a sheet of buttered paper on a baking-slab, roll the trimmings of the paste 
out into a long strip, cut it lengthwise into three, and plait them. Moisten round the 
edges of the cake with a paste-brush dipped in milk, and lay the plait round. Bake 
the paste until lightly browned in a moderate oven. Beat the yolks of three eggs 
together with the grated peel and strained juice of three oranges, four ounces of sugar, 
and one ounce of butter broken into small pieces. Turn the mixture into a lined 
stewpan, and whisk it over a slow fire until it thickens, but on no account let it boil, 
or the eggs will curdle: then move it away from the fire and let it cool. Whisk the 
whites of the eggs to a stiff snow, and stir them lightly in with the yolks. When the 
crust is nearly cold, spread the mixture over it, garnish in a circle with quarters of 
oranges from which all the white pith has been removed, pile a few tablespoonfuls of 
well-whipped cream in the center, and serve.

Marzipan Paste. 

Blanch one pound of sweet almonds and a few bitter ones, place them in a mortar 
and pound until smooth, adding a few drops of rose-water to keep them from oiling. 
Put the almond paste into a lined saucepan with one pound of sugar, and stir over the 
fire with a wooden spoon until it will not stick to the fingers when touched by them. 
Dredge a paste-board well with powdered sugar, spread the paste out on it as thickly 
as possible, and cut it into cakes of any desired shape or size. Cover a baking-sheet 
with white paper, sprinkle it over with sugar, and lay the cakes on it. Place them in 
a slow oven, and bake until of a pale yellow color. Store and keep the cakes dry in 
tins. 

. Almond Apricot Pastry. 

Put a lump of butter in a basin, warm it and beat in a little sifted, crushed loaf 
sugar, into which put the required quantity of almonds blanched and pounded with 
a little orange-flower water, and then add the whites of some eggs and the yolks of 
twice the number, one at a time, and lastly, dredge in by degrees a little dried and 
sifted flour. Work the mixture well until it is perfectly smooth, then add a little 
essence of vanilla to flavor. Put a border of rich puff-paste around a dish, pour in 
the mixture, smooth it on the top and bake in a moderate oven. When done remove 
and spread a layer of apricot jam on top of it. Put the whites of some eggs in a 
basin with a little lemon juice and icing sugar until the mixture is quite thick and of 
the consistence of butter. Put this icing over the jam, smoothing over the surface, 
and set in the oven again for a few minutes for the icing to set. Take out, let it get 
cold, cut into slices, and serve. 

Pistachio Cake. 

Weigh eight eggs in their shells and allow an equal weight of caster-sugar and 
the weight of two eggs of potato flour and the same of pistachio nuts. Separate the 
yolks from the whites of the eggs and beat the yolks with the sugar; beat the whites 
of the eggs to a stiff snow and blanch and pound the nuts, stirring in gradually half of 
the potato flour, and when well beaten half of the whites of egg. When quite smooth 
add the remainder of the flour, the beaten whites of egg and then the pistachios. 
The potato flour should be sprinkled in very gradually or it will become lumpy. Pour 
this mixture into well-buttered cake-tins and bake in a slow oven. When done turn 
the cake out onto a piece of white paper and allow it to get cold; then mask it with 
lemon-flavored icing, smoothing it over evenly with the blade of a knife, and place in 
a cool oven for a minute or two to dry the icing. If desired the cake may be deco- 
rated with fancy designs in angelica, preserved cherries, etc. It should be kept in a 
cool place.

Plum Cake. 

A raised paste should be made with three ounces of butter, ten ounces of flour 
and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, three eggs, half an ounce of yeast and the requisite 
quantity of milk; when risen enough turn it out onto a well-floured board and roll it 
into a thin, square shape, put on a baking-sheet and place a rim of paste around the 
edge. Allow it to stand for about twenty minutes and brush the top over with 
butter, sprinkle in a few bitter almonds blanched and finely chopped and mixed with 
a quantity of cinnamon powdered. Cut the black- plums in halves, removing the 
stones, and arrange on the paste with the skin side downward and putting them so as 
to overlap each other, then dust them over with caster-sugar and put the cake in a 
moderate oven to bake for twenty minutes or so. When done sprinkle over with 
more of the caster-sugar and allow it to become quite cold, when it should be cut up 
into squares of any desired size and shapes, placed on a dish, and served. 

Pop-Overs. 

Mix to a smooth batter % two breakfast cupfuls of flour and milk and the yolks 
of a couple of eggs, together with a teaspoonful of salt. Butter thoroughly a 
dozen small earthenware jars, and place them in a pan in the oven to heat; then 
beat the whites of a couple of eggs to a stiff froth, and mix in with the rest, and 
afterwards put the batter into the heated, buttered jars, and set them in the oven 
and bake until they rise well and are of a brown color at the sides, where they have 
risen above the jars; turn them out into cups, and serve hot. 



Portuguese Cake. 



Beat in a basin until frothy the yolks of six eggs, and half a pound of caster- 
sugar; stir a quarter of a pound of blanched almonds with the white of an egg to 
prevent oiling, rub them through a sieve into a kitchen basin, (ground almonds will 
do as well) and mix them with one pinch of grated orange-peel (to give zest) and 
the juice of three or four oranges. When the yolks of eggs and sugar are frothy, 
mix in gradually a quarter of a pound of potato-flour and the whites of six well- 
beaten eggs. Butter and paper a baking-sheet, pour the mixture on this about one 
inch thick, and bake in a slow oven. When the cake is done, allow it to cool, trim 
the surface, and mask first with a thin layer of apricot marmalade, and then with a 
layer of orange-flavored icing. 

Pound Cake. 

Have a pound and a half of sugar and twelve ounces of butter, and work to 
a cream; then add twelve well-beaten eggs, a pound and a half of sifted flour, and

the grated white of a cocoanut, put in a sharp oven, an/d bake for half an hour. 

Puff-Paste Cakes. 

Prepare one pound of puff-paste of six turns, put it in a cold place for a few 
minutes, then roll it out to one-fourth inch in thickness. Cut it with a sharp knife 
into pieces of a rectangular shape about four inches long and two inches broad, which 
cut again into halves across from one corner to the other; mark with the point of a 
knife in lines converging to the square corner so as to resemble a fan. Butter a bak- 
ing-tin, lay the pieces of paste on their sides on it leaving a small space between 
them, and bake in a very quick oven. Arrange them on a hot dish, dust over with 
sugar, and serve.

Ratafias. 

Small biscuits so called because made with almonds, taking their name from the 
liquor. They are very nice for garnishes and are made as follows: Blanch and pound 
in a mortar one-half pound each of bitter and sweet almonds, adding gradually the 
whites of seven eggs. When the almonds are pounded fine sift two pounds of pow- 
dered sugar into the mortar and work it well with the pestle. It is very important 
that the sugar should be thoroughly incorporated with the other ingredients. Wash 
a bladder very clean, cut a small hole at one end of it and fasten by binding a glass 
tube the size of a quill into it; or use a biscuit bag. Put into the bladder or bag the 
ratafia paste, press it gently through the tube and let it drop onto an egg wafer paper, 
dropping in the biscuits so that they do not touch each other. Bake them on tin 
baking-sheets in a hot oven. Separate, trim off the egg paper with scissors and set 
in a screen to dry. 

Savarin Cake. 

By many cooks this cake is confounded with the Baba Cake; but there is no 
good reason for associating the two together. Rub three-quarters of a pound of 
butter into a pound and a quarter of flour, then mix in five tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
four well-beaten eggs and sufficient warm milk to make a dough. Knead it well, 
then mix in a quarter of a pound of leaven. Blanch and chop very fine two ounces 
of sweet almonds; butter the interior of a cake-mould and spread the chopped almonds 
over it, put in the cake mixture and place it in a warm place to rise. When well 
risen set the cake in the oven and bake it. Put half a pint of water in a saucepan 
with a quarter of a pound of sugar and boil until it is reduced to two-thirds its orig- 
inal quantity, then pour in two wineglassfuls of rum, boil it up and remove from the 
fire. When cooked turn the cake out of the mould onto a dish and pour the sauce 
over it. It may then be served either hot or cold. 

Savory Cake. 

Beat four eggs, stir them with two heaped tablespoonfuls of flour, mix in one 
tablespoonful of minced chives and a little salt. Butter a shallow tin, pour in the 
cake mixture and bake it in a brisk oven until thoroughly browned. 

Shortcakes. 

Rub together half a pound of butter and a pound of flour, mixing in a quarter of 
a pound of caster-sugar, a beaten egg and half a pint of milk. Dust a board with 
some flour and roll out the paste quite thin, then cut into small fancy shapes, brush- 
ing over the top of each with a paste-brush dipped in beaten white of egg, and dust 
some caster-sugar over the top; then butter some tin dishes, place the cakes in them 



774 PASTRY. 

and bake in a quick oven for about ten to twelve minutes, and serve either hot or cold, 
as desired. 

Peach Shortcake. 

Peel one quart of ripe peaches, cut them in small pieces, mix them with a break- 
fast cupful of sugar, and set them in a cool place. Rub eight ounces of butter in 
twelve ounces of flour, make a hollow in the center, then pour in one breakfast cupful 
of ice water, and mix it up soft. Sprinkle a little flour over a paste-board, and roll 
the paste out on it, folding and rolling it out three or four times to make it flakey; 
gather the paste into a lump, let it stand five minutes, then roll it about one-fourth 
inch in thickness, and bake it on a baking-sheet. Split the cake into two when baked, 
spread some peaches and sugar on the lower half, put the top on, the cut side up, and 
spread more peaches and sugar over that, place it on a dish, and serve with cream. 



Strawberry Shortcake. 



Sift one and one-half pounds of flour and three heaping teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder through a fine hair-sieve onto a marble slab, then rub in three ounces of 
butter until it is perfectly smooth, add one saltspoonful of salt, a little more than 
one-half teacupful of sugar, and stir in sufficient milk to form the whole into a stiff 
paste. Mix well, dredge the paste lightly over with flour, and roll it out very thin. 
Divide the paste into six equal-sized squares. Butter a shallow baking-dish, put in 
one square of the paste, spread a little butter over it, and dredge it lightly over with 
flour; place another square of paste over the first one, flour and butter that also, and 
proceed in the same way with the remainder. Put the cake into a brisk oven, and 
bake it for about twenty minutes. When cooked, turn the cake out of the tin, lay it 
on a dish, and put over it as many fresh strawberries as will cover it, strew over some 
powdered sugar, and cover with another layer of cake. Finish with alternate layers 
of strawberries and cake, making the last layer of strawberries, over which sift more 
sugar. Whip about one pint of rich cream to a stiff froth, pile it all around the cake, 
and serve. 

Soda Cakes. 

Mix one teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda with one pound of flour, and rub 
into it half a pound of warm butter. When quite smooth, add three beaten eggs, 
half a pound of currants washed and dried, half a pound of caster-sugar, and a few 
caraway seeds. When thoroughly mixed, put in buttered tin, and bake. 



Spice Cakes. 



Put one and one-fourth pound of flour in a basin and rub in one pound of butter 
with the hands until smooth, mix in one pound of well washed currants, one-fourth 
pound of moist sugar, one-third of a tablespoonful of pounded spice, one-half table- 



PASTRY. 775 

spoonful of yeast that has been dissolved in a little warm water, the beaten yolks of 
two and the white of one egg, together with one wineglassful of brandy. Stir the 
ingredients well and stand the mixture close to the fire, where it will rise for thirty 
minutes or so. Divide the cake mixture into small portions, mould these into nicely- 
shaped cakes, place them on baking-sheets and bake in a moderate oven. Leave the 
cakes until cold, then pile them on a dish, and serve. 

Sponge-Cakes, Large. 

Boil one pound of lump sugar in a teacupful of boUing water, and when boiling 
pour it over six eggs, whisk for half an hour; sift in slowly two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, grate the rind of one lemon and mix in. When well worked together put in a 
greased mould of any suitable shape and bake for three-quarters of an hour, or a 
little longer if required. 

Almond Sponge Cake. 

Take a sufficient quantity of sweet almonds and mix the whites of some eggs, 
adding a little grated lemon rind, sugar and the yolks of fifteen or sixteen eggs, well 
whisked. Then take the whites of a dozen or so eggs, whip them to a froth and stir 
them in; sift in slowly, beating all the time, a small quantity of dried flour, then pour 
this into a tin, carefully buttered and dusted with fine sugar, until it is half full; put 
it into the oven and bake for an hour. When done turn it out and set it on the sieve 
to cool. 

Sponge Cake, Chantilly. 

Cut off the top of a stale sponge cake, scoop out the inside, leaving the wall 
three-quarters of an inch thick. Put this on a glass dish, fill the hollow with one-half 
pound of cherries (stoned and stalks taken off), pour over them a wineglassful of 
brandy, and then replace the top of the cake. Put one-half pint of rich cream and 
one ounce of powdered white sugar into a large bowl, and with an egg-whisk whip 
the cream to a stiff froth; add to this six or eight drops of essence of vanilla, and 
pour it over the cake just before serving. 

St. Honore Cake. 

This exceptionally beautiful dish requires much skill and patience to prepare. 
Peel neatly two medium-sized, sound, blood oranges. Separate carefully the sec- 
tions to prevent tearing the skin, for, if they should lose any of their juice they will 
be of little use. Lay a sheet of paper over a tin plate, arranging the pieces of 
orange on top, and leave them to dry for hours in a warm place. Wipe neatly 
twenty-four malaga grapes, leaving on each one about a third of an inch of stem, so 
that they will remain firm while using them. Beat up a pint and a half of sweet 



776 PASTRY. 

vanilla cream, and lay it aside in a cool place until needed. Roll three ounces of 
tart-paste into a round piece eight or nine inches in diameter. Lay it on a baking- 
sheet ten inches wide, and prepare a chou-paste as follows: Put into a saucepan one 
gill of cold milk, with one ounce of best butter, place it on a hot fire, and, when 
boiling, add at once three ounces of well-sifted flour. Stir- briskly with the spatula 
all round, take it from the fire, set it on a table, and add immediately one saltspoon- 
ful of powdered sugar, mixing well for one minute more. Break an egg in it, stir 
briskly for one minute; break in another, mix again, and then another, mixing all to- 
gether for two minutes. Push down the pastry bag a small tube, pour in the above 
preparation, and press down the top with the hands onto the edge of the paste in the 
baking-sheet, so as to form an even border half an inch high, and with the remainder 
of the paste press down onto another baking-sheet into twenty-four small, round chou- 
pans half an inch in diameter, leaving them one inch apart. Glaze the surfaces with 
a beaten egg, and place them in a brisk oven to bake for about twelve minutes. Re- 
move, and allow them to get thoroughly cold. Spread over the paste inside the 
border two tablespoonfuls of apple marmalade; then put it in a moderate oven to 
bake for twenty-five minutes. Make a paper cornet, cut off a quarter of an inch from 
the point, and put into it three ounces of red currant jelly. Press this out gently, di- 
viding it equally among the twenty-four small chous. Make one pound of granulated 
sugar into a rich syrup. Oil two square feet of the surface of a marble table and place 
at hand the pan containing the syrup. Plunge one of the grapes into this, remove it im- 
mediately with a fork and place it on the oiled table. Proceed the same with the other 
twenty-three, being careful to lay them one inch apart from each other. Now dip 
twelve of the sections of prepared oranges into the syrup, one at a time, and lay 
them on the oiled table exactly the same as the grapes. Dip carefully the surfaces 
of the small chou into the syrup, and lay on the same oiled table. Then take the 
St. Honore bottom in the baking-sheet, and proceed to 'arrange it as follows: With 
the syrup standing on the right, lift the chous up, one by one, dipping one side of each 
lightly in the syrup, arranging them on top of the chou-paste border, close together 
to form a crown. Should the sugar be too thick, return it to the stove and allow it 
to boil up again; then take it off, and dip the thin part of the oranges lightly in it, 
and lay them over the small chous, the thick part upward, each one adhering to the 
other until they form a crown. Dip the tops of the grapes lightly into the same 
sugar, and place one upon each joint of the oranges, with another in the center, the 
stems being upward; attach to the small chous the six remaining grapes, dividing 
them evenly. Arrange a fancy paper on a dessert-dish, and lay the St. Honore over 
it carefully; then take the frothy part of the whipped cream, transfer it to another 
dish, and, with the whisk, beat briskly for five minutes, adding half a gill of good 
cognac, a quarter of gill of kirsch, and three ounces of well-pounded and sifted maca- 
roons. Stir well together for two minutes longer, and fill the empty space of the St. 
Honore with three-quarters of this preparation, keeping it as high as possible. With 
the use of the pastry-bag and fancy-tube, press down the balance of the cream, and 



PASTRY. 777 

decorate artistically the top and sides, taking care not to put any on the oranges, and 
then send the cake to table. 

Tea Cakes. 

Sift one pound of flour onto a pasteboard, make a well in the center of it, in 
which put one saltspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of sugar and one-half pound of 
slightly-warmed butter. Mix all well together, then stir in four well-beaten eggs 
and enough cold water to form a stiff paste. Knead the paste well with the hands, 
then roll it out to about one-fourth of an inch in thickness. Cut the paste into 
rounds with a tin-cutter about four inches in diameter, butter a baking-dish, lay the 
pieces of paste on it, brush them over with a paste-brush dipped in water and sift a 
small quantity of powdered-sugar over the top of them. Bake the cakes in a mod- 
erate oven, and serve when cold. 

Vacherin. 

This is the name of a French paste, and it is used chiefly for making a case to 
hold chantilly cream. It is compounded of ground or pounded almonds, sugar and 
the whites of eggs. The following recipe is for: 



Chantilly Vacherin. 



Prepare a paste by beating up one pound of ground almonds and one pound of 
powdered or icing-sugar with as many whites of eggs as are necessary to bind it and 
give to it a firm consistence. Cut off about three-fourths of the paste and roll it out 
into a flat strip long enough and deep enough to go around the outside of a charlotte 
mould so as to cover the side and overlap at the extremities of the strip. Fasten the 
ends together with strong icing-sugar, and then, after trimming the edges all round 
to the exact size of the mould, place it in a quick oven and bake it until nicely 
browned. In order to keep the ends together while it is baking, tie round the strip a 
piece of broad tape or string, removing it as soon as the joint is strong. Then form a 
flat round with the remainder of the paste and place that on the top of the strip after it 
has been removed from the mould. Stick the bottom on the strip with icing, and then 
place it in the oven again to set and brown nicely. When the case is strong and 
cold, turn it up and set it on a glass-dish with a lace-paper underneath and then pro- 
ceed to decorate the outside of the case with tinted meringue applied through a cor- 
net, halves of candied cherries and beads of colored meringue as fancy may dictate. 
When all ready, place the case in a drying-stove until the meringue is well set. Be- 
fore serving, fill the case with heaped up well-whipped vanilla cream and sprinkle 
some variegated nonpareils over the cream. The base may be garnished with maca- 
roons or other sweet biscuits and the vacherin may be tinted rose, cream or lavender.

Vanilla Cake. 

Prepare about one pound of fine puff paste, roll it out thin, sprinkle over a few 
drops of essence of vanilla, fold the paste over and work it in. Place it on a baking- 
sheet, have it six inches wide and two and one-half inches thick or thereabouts; 
surround it with a band of thick paper to prevent its spreading while cooking, brush 
the surface with egg, decorate it into any desired form, place it in a quick oven and 
bake it for about two hours and a half or more. This cake must be allowed to remain 
in the oven until entirely done, otherwise it will be soft and uneatable. When done, 
sprinkle over some sugar, and serve cold. If the vanilla flavoring is not liked, the 
cakes may be flavored with almost anything else, such as chopped orange-flowers, 
orange or citron peel, currants, Parmesan cheese, or any flavoring that may be pre- 
ferred. 

Walnut Cake (Large). 

Warm one-half pound of butter, and beat together with one-half pound of sugar 
until creamy; then sift in one-fourth pound of flour that has been mixed with one tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder and a pinch of salt. Add one-half pound of peeled and 
chopped walnuts, and flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla essence. Whip the whites 
of eight eggs to a stiff froth, and stir them into the above mixture. Butter a cake-tin, 
pour in the mixture, and bake for half an hour in a moderate oven. When done, turn 
the cake out onto a tin, and leave it until cold. 

Wine Cake. 

Put six tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar into a saucepan with one pint of wine, 
and stir it over the fire till on the point of boiling. Take the sweetened wine off the 
fire and leave it till cooled to blood heat. Beat six eggs well, and mix them with 
the wine, then stir the liquor gradually into four ounces of the best white flour, and 
beat it well. Butter a cake-tin, pour in the cake, and bake it in a quick oven. 
Remove the cake from the tin as soon as baked. 



Genoese Pastry. 



Warm four ounces of fresh butter, heat it, then mix in four ounces of sugar, and 
whip the two together until creamy ; beat in, one at a time, four eggs, then stir in 
quickly four ounces of finely-sifted flour, and work it till quite smooth. Butter 
a flat tin thick, pour the mixture onto it spreading it to about one-half inch in thick- 
ness, and bake at once for fifteen minutes in a brisk oven. When cooked turn the 
pastry onto a sieve, and leave until cool, the underside uppermost. Spread a thin 
layer of apricot jam over the pastry, then a layer of chocolate icing, and put it to dry 
for a minute in an oven. When quite cold cut the pastry into various fancy shapes, 
and serve. 



PASTRY. 779 

Neapolitan Pastry 

Make a rich puff paste, roll it out to about one-half inch in thickness, and cut it 
into strips about two inches wide; lay these on a baking-dish, a little distance from 
each other so that when they spread they will not join, and bake in a quick oven. 
Remove and mask half of them with raspberry or strawberry jam, and place the other 
half on top. Ice them with colored icing, arrange tastefully on a fancy dish, and 
serve. 

Royal Pastry. 

Put two gills of water in a large saucepan with a little more than four ounces 
of fresh butter, two ounces of sugar, the peel of one lemon, and a little salt. Boil it 
till the butter is melted, then take the lemon peel out; throw in sufficient finely-sifted 
flour to make a stiff paste, stir it over the fire with a wooden spoon till the paste can 
be easily detached from the saucepan, then take it off. Break in, one at a time, five 
or six eggs, but do not put more than the paste can absorb, and mix each one in before 
the next is added. Shape the paste into equal-sized balls, and put them about one 
inch apart from each other on a baking-sheet. Brush over with a paste-brush dipped 
in beaten egg and milk, put them in a moderately hot oven, and do not open the door 
till they are done, or they will flatten. Dry them, detach them from the baking-sheet 
with the point of a knife, make a small hole in the tops, put one teaspoonful of jam, 
or any kind of sweetmeat in each, and serve. 

Wafers. 

A variety of wafers will be found described under various headings, their mode 
of preparation being thoroughly explained. Should it be desired to make the wafers 
exceedingly thin and exact in size, it is desirable to use wafer-irons or tongs, which 
are of square, round, oval, or oblong shape, the faces being made to stamp patterns 
or letters. The following will be found excellent recipes: 



Blanch and pound to a pulp in a mortar a sufficient quantity of sweet almonds 
and beat with them two eggs to each half pound of the almonds used; then sift grad- 
ually, while beating, some powdered sugar and a little fine flour; add two or three 
drops of the essence of lemon. Butter lightly a warm, clean baking-sheet and spread 
the mixture with a spatula very thinly and evenly over it and place in a quick oven 
and bake until of a pale brown color. Then remove, cut the paste with a knife into 
oblongs and roll each lengthwise around a piece of round stick about a half inch in 
diameter. Let them get cold and hard and then remove the sticks. These wafers 
are very useful as a garnish for creams and other light, sweet entremets. 



780 PASTRY. 

Chocolate Wafers. 

Whisk the whites of two eggs, then mix them with four ounces of grated 
chocolate, half a pound of powdered sugar and enough flour to form a stiff paste. 
Roll out thin, cut into cakes and lay on a baking-tin and bake for fifteen minutes. 
When cooked roll them, one at a time, around the handle of a wooden spoon. 

Cinnamon Wafers. 

Sift six ounces of finely-powdered white sugar, place it in an earthenware basin 
with six or eight ounces of flour, half an ounce of powdered cinnamon and six ounces 
of melted butter and one well beaten egg. Mix all these with a small quantity of 
milk to a thin paste. Heat an iron plate very hot, rub it over well with butter, put 
on it a teaspoonful of paste, fry to a good brown, turn it and fry the opposite side 
brown also; then roll it round a small stick. Proceed in this way, frying the paste 
and rolling it round the stick till all are done. Let the wafers get quite cold before 
removing the sticks. 

Wafers Filled with Cream. 

Beat together one-fourth pound of powdered vanilla sugar and the whites of 
three eggs until frothy. Dry well one-half pound of flour and pass it through a fine 
sieve. Blanch, peel and chop one pound of sweet almonds and mix them together 
with the flour into the beaten eggs, adding gradually two more beaten eggs and a 
small pinch of salt. When the paste is quite smooth (it should be liquid), bake a 
little of it in the oven to test its consistency Wax and sprinkle with flour some bak- 
ing-sheets, spread thin layers of the above mixture over them and bake in a moderate 
oven. When done divide the wafers into four-inch squares and roll them into the 
shape of cornets. Have in readiness a decorated gum-paste stand with a small sup- 
port in the center with two round shelves jutting out a little above each other. Fix 
the stand on a round glass dish, place nine of the cornets side by side round the 
lower shelf, six round the second shelf and stand a vase of sweets on the top; use 
sugar icing to'make the cornets adhere to the stand. Flavor one pint or more of 
thick cream with a little vanilla and whip it to a thick froth; then fill the cornets with 
the cream and garnish round the base of the stand with macaroons and candied fruits 
and round the bottom of the lower shelf with candied flowers. Serve as soon as 
prepared. 

French Wafers. 

Put one-half pound of finely-sifted flour into a basin with one-half pound of 
crushed sugar, one pinch of salt and one tablespoonful of vanilla. Beat the whites 
of four eggs with one-half pint of whipped cream. Beat them gradually in with the 
flour, etc., and work the whole into a smooth batter; then pour in one wineglassful 



PASTRY. 781 

of brandy and work it thoroughly for about ten minutes. Heat the wafer irons, 
brush them over on the inside with a paste-brush dipped in clarified butter, pour one 
good tablespoonful of the batter on the bottom or under sheet of the wafer irons, 
close the tongs tightly and bake the wafers on both sides. They must be of a very 
light fawn color, and when done are to be immediately rolled into shape upon a stick 
made for the purpose about five inches long and one inch in thickness. When all are 
done the wafers should be packed in a tin box and kept in a warm, dry place until 
required for use. 

Lemon Wafers. 

Beat two eggs and mix with them three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and 
flour, the juice of one and the grated peel of half a lemon. Stir the above to mix 
well, then spread it in small thin cakes on a buttered baking-sheet, place them in a 
slow oven and bake until slightly colored. When cooked take the cakes out of the 
oven, roll them, one at a time, round the handle of a wooden spoon, and serve. 

Vanilla Flavored Wafers. 

These are made the same as wafers with pistachios, mixing half a stick of vanilla 
well pounded with the sugar, and half a glass of brandy in place of the orange-flower 
water. 

American Waffles. 

Boil one teacupful of rice until it is quite soft; stir m with it a raw egg, one 
tablespoonful each of flour and milk, and beat all together to a smooth paste. Allow 
it to cool, put it into well-greased waffle irons, and cook. When the waffles are done 
on both sides, lay them on a hot plate, butter them, and serve hot. 

French Waffles. 

Put nine ounces of flour in a basin with one teacupful of sugar, one tablespoonful 
of vanilla sugar, one wineglassful of noyeau, and the yolks of eight or nine eggs; 
when well mixed stir in an equal number of whites of eggs and one pint of cream. 
Cook the waffles as directed for flemish waffles. 

Raised Waffles. 

At night mix together one pint of lukewarm milk in which two tablespoonfuls of 
butter have been melted, two tablespoonfuls of liquid yeast, or half a small cake of 
compressed yeast dissolved in one gill of water, two well-beaten eggs, one teaspoonful 
of salt, and about one pound of flour. When this batter is thoroughly mixed, cover 
it, and stand it over night in a warm place. In the morning, heat a waffle-iron, butter 
it, put in the batter without stirring it down, and then bake the waffles. Serve with 
butter and powdered sugar. 



Pastes. 

Almond Paste. 

Blanch some Jordan almonds the day before they are required for use and allow 
them to remain in cold water. Soak two-thirds of this quantity of clean gum-dragon 
in a jar with a little water long enough to allow it to absorb all the water. Pound 
the almonds to a pulp, adding a little lemon juice to prevent them from oiling. 
When they are like a smooth paste, rub them through a sieve. Having done this, put 
the almonds into a sugar-boiler with some icing-sugar and stir well with a wooden 
spoon. This should be done briskly so that the paste should not be allowed to 
color. When it does not stick to the sides of the pan, it may be taken off the fire. 
The gum must now be squeezed through strong cloth, rubbed upon a slab and grad- 
ually worked into paste, together with a little more of the sugar. This kind of paste 
is usually employed for making baskets, etc., which, when filled with strawberries 
and cream, 'or any other kind of fruit make a pretty dish. 

Chopped Paste. 

Put one quart of pastry-flour, two breakfast cupfuls of butter, one tablespoonful 
of sugar and one teaspoonful of salt on a chopping-board and chop them all together 
until well mixed; add three-fourths of a breakfast cupful of iced- water and continue 
chopping. When thoroughly mixed, lift the paste, sprinkle the board with flour, then 
roll the paste out thin on it. The paste is better to stand on ice for a while, as it 
should be hard before being used. 

Crisp Paste. 

Sift four ounces of flour and two ounces of powdered white sugar; mix together 
and work them into a paste with the well-beaten yolks of two eggs. Use a wooden 
spoon to mix the paste, touching it as little as possible with the hands. This paste 
may be used in making fruit tarts; it should be baked in a hot oven and immediately 
before putting it into the oven should be brushed over with well-beaten white of egg 
and sprinkled with powdered white sugar. 

Croquante Paste. 

Mix eight ounces of fine sugar with one pound of flour, then stir in sufficient 
beaten yolks of eggs to form a smooth paste. When well-kneaded, roll it out in the 

782 



PASTES. 783 

specified shape and about one-fourth inch thick. Rub the shape with butter and 
press the paste closely over it to cut the pattern well through, then lay it on a bak- 
ing-tin, dip a paste-brush in the beaten white of egg, and brush the surface of the 
paste over; sprinkle with sugar and bake in a slow oven. When cooked, remove it 
carefully from the tin, and cover with jam. 

Paste for Borders. 

Put into a bowl the yolks of six or eight eggs, a few drops of water and a little 
salt, and mix in flour till it is so stiff that it can hardly be worked. Beat and work 
it till quite smooth, and keep it moist until required; roll it out quite thin, cut it in 
the desired shapes, and then place them on the dish before they get too dry. Brush 
over with the white of egg. 

Paste for Cheese Cakes. 

Mix with one pound of best-sifted flour three ounces of powdered sugar. Beat 
eight ounces of butter till of a creamy consistence, then sift the flour and sugar gradu- 
ally into it. When well mixed, work in the whole yolks of three eggs and the well- 
beaten whites of two. It is then ready for use. 

Paste for Custards or Preserved Fruits. 

Put six ounces of butter over the fire in a saucepan with six tablespoonfuls of 
water, let it come to the boil, and then mix into it as much flour as will make a stiff 
paste, Knead and beat it with a rolling-pin till smooth, then form it into a lump, 
and cover with a cloth till almost cold. Take a piece of the paste large enough for 
the purpose, knead it into a lump, then press the knuckles of the left hand into the 
top nearly in the middle, and with the right hand keep working the paste up the back 
of the left hand, shifting it round and round meanwhile, forming the paste into a cir- 
cular shape with a flat bottom and upright sides like an ordinary jam-pot. The paste 
ought to be stiff enough to keep in shape when the hand is withdrawn if it has not 
been pressed too thin or into holes. Trim the edges, line the paste with paper till 
half-baked, then remove the paper, pour in the custard or preserve, and finish baking. 

Paste for Ornamenting Tartlets. 

Rub one ounce of butter into four ounces of flour. Mix it to a stiff paste with a 
little cold water, rub it well on the board until it begins to string, then cut it into four 
or five pieces and roll them out, draw it into fine strings, and lay them across the tart- 
lets in any fancied pattern. 



784 PASTES. 

Paste for Patties. 

Sift one pound of the best white flour through a fine wire sieve onto a marble 
slab ; mix with it a few drops of lemon-juice, a saltspoonful of salt, and stir it into a 
stiff paste with cold water. Squeeze the water out of one pound of butter by putting 
it in a cloth and working it well with both hands; then put it in the middle of the 
paste, fold the edges round it, and roll it out. Fold the paste in three, turn it round 
and roll it the other way. Let it rest for twenty minutes, then roll it twice more, and 
so on until it has been rolled six times. Next roll the paste out to the thickness of 
one-half inch, and with a plain tin cutter two and one-half inches in diameter, cut the 
paste into rounds; the cutter should be dipped into hot water each time it is used. 
Place the rounds on a baking-tin, brush them over with a paste-brush dipped in beaten 
egg, then with a tin cutter about one and one-half inches in diameter, cut half way 
through the center of each round. Bake them in a brisk oven, taking care not to let 
the paste brown too much. When the patties are cooked, lift the paste where the 
circle is marked, that being to form the covers, scoop out some of the paste and fill 
them with whatever has been prepared for them. 



Paste for Oyster Patties. 

Put twelve ounces of well-sifted flour in a basin, and mix in with it the strained 
juice of a lemon, and a sufficient quantity of water to form a light dough. Dredge a 
marble slab with flour, put the dough on it and knead it well, then roll it out, spread 
twelve ounces of butter over, fold it again, and roll out four times, then fold it in 
three and stand it in a cool place. In about two hours' time roll the paste out to 
about one-third inch in thickness, and cut out several large rounds, and the same 
number of small ones, using two different sized paste cutters, which should be dipped 
in flour each time to prevent their sticking. Lay the rounds on a baking-tin and 
bake them till lightly browned. When cooked scoop a little of the paste out of the 
center of each round, fill the hollow with whatever may have been prepared for it, 
and cover with the smaller rounds. 



Paste for Pies. 

Put three pounds of well-sifted flour on a board or table, work in one pound of 
butter, make a hollow in the center, and work in the yolks of four eggs, one ounce of 
salt, and a breakfast cupful of cold water. Should the paste while being used be too 
hard and crack, it may be rolled out again and slightly dampened with water before 
being worked up. If preferred, the butter may be mixed in with the liquids, before 
being introduced into the flour, which must be well worked in, adding it gradually. 
It is far easier to make this paste in winter than in summer.

Paste for Meat and Game Pies. 

Use eight ounces of butter to one pound of flour; chop one-half the butter into 
the flour, and add one teaspoonful of salt and enough cold water, to mix it to a 
smooth paste just soft enough to roll out. If ice-water is used, the paste is mixed 
with a knife instead of the hand, as it can be kept cooler, and will be lighter and 
more delicate. In making, touch the paste as little and as lightly as possible with 
the hands, because heating and pressing heavily upon it makes it dense and tough. 
After the paste is mixed and rolled about one-half inch thick, dredge it with flour, 
cut half the remaining butter into slices, and lay them on the paste, leaving a space 
of about one inch all around the edges, dredge the butter with flour, turn the edges 
in all round to enclose the outside layers of butter, and then double the paste, and 
roll it out about one-half inch thick, put the rest of the butter on it in slices, dredge 
again with flour, fold in the edges, double it, and roll out as already directed. If any 
paste is left after the pie is made, wrap it in a floured cloth and keep in a cool dry 
place; it will be good for several days, and only requires to be rolled out two or three 
times before using to make it quite light. 



Paste for Savory Pies. 



Boil about three ounces of lard, and two ounces of dripping with one teacupful 
of water. While this is hot, mix with it smooth sufficient flour to make a stiff 
paste. Knead it well and beat it with the rolling-pin till quite smooth. Knead it 
into a lump, and turn a pan over it until it is almost cold. Then roll it to a proper 
thickness on a floured board with a floured rolling-pin. Cut out a piece for the 
bottom of the pie, a piece for the top, and a long narrow piece to form the sides. 
Fasten the bottom to the sides by brushing egg over the edges and then pressing 
them well together, joining up the side edges in the same way. Fill the pie, then put 
on the cover, brushing the edges over with beaten egg, and pinching them together. 
If the pie is made in a tin mould, all the edges must be fastened together in just the 
same way. The tin must be well buttered before putting the paste in, and when the 
pie is baked it should be slipped out of the tin and put back into the oven to brown 
the sides, first brushing beaten egg all over. 



Geneva Paste. 

Rub one pound of fresh butter into one pound of finely-sifted dried flour until 
the butter is entirely absorbed, then work in one pound of sugar and four ounces of 
blanched and pounded almonds, adding three bitter almonds to the quantity and a 
little salt. Mix with sufficient beaten egg to make a stiff paste. This is useful in 
making Genevese and other fancy pastry. 



7 86 PASTES. 

Lard Paste. 

Cut some lard into thin slices and roll these in a little flour; continue thus until 
all the lard and flour are used, then mix in enough cold water to make a soft paste. 
Lay the paste on a floured cloth and keep it in a cold place for half an hour. After 
that put it on a floured paste-board and roll it out with a floured rolling-pin to the 
thickness of one inch. Place the paste again in a floured cloth in a cold place and 
leave it half an hour longer. Roll the paste out very thin, doubling it over six 
times. The paste should be touched as little as possible with the hands. 

Paste Made with Cream. 

Mix one-half teaspoonful each of salt and bicarbonate of soda with one breakfast 
cupful of cream; stir in gradually enough flour to make a stiff paste. Sprinkle a little 
flour on the table, and roll the paste out on it to about one-half inch thick. Cut 
about two ounces of butter in small pieces and. put these on the paste; sift over a little 
flour, double the paste and roll it out thin. It is then ready to be used. 

Puff Paste. 

By the French cook this is styled feuilletage, and is prepared as follows: Weigh 
out the flour, previously dried and shaken through a sieve, and use an equal amount of 
the best fresh butter. In the summer keep this butter on the ice till wanted; in winter 
knead it in a cloth to make it supple. Then spread the flour on the table or marble 
paste-slab; make a bay or well in the center. Into this put a little salt, and gradu- 
ally pour in water whilst the flour is worked in by a circular motion of two fingers 
round and round the inside of the well until sufficient moisture has been added to 
work the remainder of the flour into a firm pliant dough. If this is well and correctly 
made it will not stick either to the table or to the hands. Cover the paste with a 
cloth, and let it stand a few minutes to settle, but first be quite sure that the paste is 
stiff, as it would be disadvantageous to work in more flour or water after the paste 
has settled. In ten or fifteen minutes the dough will be ready to work. Sprinkle 
the slab with flour by means of a dredger, which should contain very dry flour only, 
or the perforations in the lid will get stopped up, place the paste on this, and roll it 
out with a rolling-pin, which may be either plain or fitted with an axle and two 
handles, so that the hands remain quiet while working (either answers admirably). 
The one with the handles, which is sometimes preferred, permits the operator to bear 
heavily on the paste, but this is not always an advantage. Roll out the paste to a 
square not more than one-fourth of an inch thick. Roll out the butter also to a 
square shape, and lay it on the paste. Fold over the ends and then the sides in such 
a manner that the butter is entirely wrapped up. Roll this out with the pin, pushing 
the paste forward as well as the butter in its interior; continue rolling until it forms a 



PASTES. 787 

long strip, not more than one-eighth or one-sixth inch in thickness, preserving the 
regularity of shape as much as possible. Next fold it over in three layers, and when 
thus folded give it another turn; this is called one turn. Roll it out once more the 
same way. Every time this process is repeated adds what is termed a turn to the 
paste; the very most required at any time for the lightest of French feuilletage being 
six turns; five are generally recognized as good enough for most purposes, and many 
pastry cooks will not exceed three. A very famous French cook advises that under 
all circumstances, whether in winter or summer, the paste should be set to cool for 
ten minutes between each two turns. The greatest care must be taken to prevent the 
butter from escaping from the paste. This happens if the paste is too soft, rolled out 
too thin, or not rolled out regularly to a flat; that is, if it remains thicker on one side 
than on the other. In summer it is very difficult to make a good paste without the 
help of ice or a cool cellar; but this inconvenience may be obviated by replacing the 
butter with beef suet. This suet must be previously well picked over, and then 
soaked in fresh water, well drained, and then pounded, and thus made into a fine, 
smooth paste. Should it require to be made more supple it can be worked in the 
cloth, as prescribed for the butter. The plan of making puff paste, as practiced by 
the English professional cooks, differs from the French mode. 

Take three pounds of well-dried, sifted flour and the same quantity of butter; 
rub a fourth of the butter till it is taken up in the flour, then mix with water, adding 
the juice of half a lemon. If salted butter be used, it must be washed in cold water 
so as to free it from salt. Let the paste be firm, for if it is made soft it will not be a 
success. When you have succeeded so far, roll out the paste on a slab to about one- 
third inch thick, and spread the remainder of the butter over it, which should not be 
too hard or too soft but spreadable. This done, fold over and roll out again; repeat 
this three times, then roll it up loosely, cover with a floured cloth, and put it in a 
cool place for two or three hours, or until wanted for use. You will understand from 
this that puff paste consists of a number of layers of butter and dough; these layers 
should be worked without breaking through into each other. You must, therefore, 
use your rolling pin very lightly, for if you use it too heavily you will perforate the 
paste, and the butter will run out in cooking. The trimmings of puff paste or pieces 
cut away should not be used again with the original mass, as the cut edges would 
allow the butter to overrun the layers, and spoil its flakiness. It is commonly used 
for making patties, pies, or decorating tartlets, etc., and is known to the pastry cook 
as second or patten paste. Of the varieties of puff paste, the following may be con- 
sidered the more important: 

(i.) Sift two pounds of very dry flour, put it on the table, make a hollow in 
the center, th*row in a little salt, and a little piece of two pounds of butter. In 
making this paste the same quantity each of butter and flour is used. Work the 
butter and flour together, and add the beaten yolks of three eggs, and sufficient 
water to make a paste of the consistency of the butter. If the paste is not of the 
right consistency the butter will break through when the paste is turned. When the 



y88 PASTES. 

dough has been lig.htly worked, mould it into a ball, which flatten quickly in the 
middle. Put the remainder of the two pounds of butter on the table, and work it 
with a little water to extract the buttermilk, then roll it in a cloth, and squeeze till 
all the moisture is out. Flatten the butter, put it in the paste, and fold the paste well 
over it. Sift a little flour over the table, and roll the paste out with a rolling-pin 
into a long strip. Double the paste in three, then roll it out again, sprinkling a little 
flour over to prevent its sticking. Sprinkle a baking-sheet with flour, double the 
paste in three folds, put it on a baking-sheet, and leave for a short time in a cool tem- 
perature. Roll the paste out again twice, proceeding as before; then let it rest again, 
and give it another two turns, which will make six in all, then roll it out to a long 
shape and fold it in two. It is then ready for use. 

Half Puff Paste. :, 

This is made as for puff paste, using twelve ounces of flour, one-fourth of an 
ounce of salt, ten ounces of butter and one teacupful of water, keeping the paste 
very firm. 

Puff Paste Made with Beef Suet. 

To prepare puff paste with beef suet chop the suet very fine, put it in a mortar 
and pound to a pulp, adding gradually sufficient olive oil to give it a body and to 
make it as easy to work as butter. When thoroughly worked up mix in the flour as 
for ordinary puff paste. Lard may be substituted for oil, using half lard and half 
beef suet. 

Puff Paste Made with Lard. 

To prepare puff paste with lard use twelve ounces of flour, two ounces of lard, 
the yolks of two eggs, and about two drachms of salt. Work these into a paste, let 
it stand for a few minutes, then roll it out, brush over with warm lard, fold the paste 
in three, roll it out gently again, let it stand for a few minutes, and continue in this 
way till twelve ounces of lard have been worked into the flour. It is then ready for 
use in the ordinary way. 

Puff Paste Made with Oil. 

Puff paste prepared with sweet-oil is made in the same v/ay as puff paste made 
with lard, using the same quantity of oil as lard and working it in in the same manner. 

Rice Paste for Sweets. 

Boil one-half pound of ground rice in as little water as it can be boiled in without 
burning it, strain it as dry as possible, and beat or pound it in a mortar with one ounce 
of butter and two eggs beaten very light. 



PASTES. 789 

Rice Paste for Tarts. 

Sift one-half pound of ground rice, and rub it into one-fourth pound of fresh but- 
ter; mix and knead this into a little paste with a small quantity of cold water. 
Sprinkle flour over a paste-board and rolling-pin, and roll out the paste fairly thin. 
Chop one-fourth pound of butter into small bits, and stick them all over the paste. 
After this fold, and roll it out again three times, each time sprinkling flour over the 
paste and under it, all over the paste-board and rolling-pin. Cover the tarts, brush 
the paste over with well-beaten whites of eggs, sprinkle it with powdered sugar, and 
bake. 

Short Paste. 

This, as has already been explained, differs from puff paste in that the butter or 
other fat is worked in the flour before wetting. In other particulars, one short paste 
may differ from another according to the fancy of the cook. 

Short Paste for Savory Pies. 



/ 



Sift one pound of dried flour onto the slab or table, collect it altogether in a 
heap, make a hole in the center. In this hollow, put a teaspoonful of salt and the 
yolks of two or three eggs. Put in a small stewpan one teacupful of water and four 
ounces of fresh butter; set this over the fire till the butter is melted, then pour it, 
little by little, into the hollow in the flour, and work the flour in with two fingers until 
it is all taken up and worked into a stiff paste; work this on the slab with both hands 
till it is well kneaded, then roll it into a ball, wrap it up in a floured cloth, and let it 
stand for two or three hours in a cool place; by this time the dough will have set and 
be ready for use. The rolling out should be done lightly; any heavy handling spoils 
the crust. 

Transparent Paste for Tartlets. 

Warm twelve ounces of butter without oiling it; when nearly cold again, stir in 
one beaten egg, and continue beating for a little while; sift in with the butter and egg 
one pound of the finest dried white flour, and make a thin paste with it. Butter some 
patty-pans or tart-dishes, line them with the paste, brush over a little water and sift 
some fine sugar over; bake them at once in a moderate oven. 



Bakery and Breakfast Dishes. 

Butter Biscuits. 

Mix up half a pound of butter with two pounds of sifted flour, adding a tea- 
spoonful of salt; moisten to a stiff dough with half a pint of milk and mix k well. 
Remove the dough from the pan and put it on a floured paste-board and knead thor- 
oughly; roll it into a large thick sheet and beat hard on both sides with a rolling-pin 
or break it. Then cut it out into small, round, thick cakes with a tin cutter, beat 
each cake on both sides, place them in buttered pans and bake to a light brown in a 
slow oven. 

Buttermilk Biscuits. 

Sift into a quart of flour a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda, adding a little 
salt; make a hollow in the center of the flour, pour in a pint of buttermilk and form 
into a dough, using care in rolling it out to make it as soft as possible, pressing per- 
fectly flat with the hands to knead it. Let it lay for five or six minutes to allow the 
soda to dissolve and then knead it again. Cut into shape with a cutter and dock, 
baking on a greased baking-sheet in a moderate oven until done. 



Biscuits for Coffee. 

Use a level teaspoonful of baking powder with each half pound of flour requisite 
and a little sugar and butter, making a rather stiff paste by adding some egg beaten 
up in a little milk. Work it well until quite smooth and then roll it out thin, cut it 
into biscuits three inches long by an inch and a half wide, perforate the tops with a 
docker and place in a moderately quick oven, baking to a yellow color. When done 
remove, and serve when cold. 

Honey Biscuits. 

Place in a basin half a pound each of cornmeal and honey, two tablespoonfuls of 
candied orange flowers and half a tablespoonful of pounded coriander seeds. Mix 
these well until they form a stiff paste, divide into proportions, roll them into balls, 
then with a rolling-pin roll out to thin oval shapes and dock. Butter a baking-tin, 
dredge flour over it, lay the biscuits on the tin a short distance from each other, and 
bake in a slow oven. When cooked leave them until cold and if to be kept put them 
into tin canisters.

BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 791 

Lemon Biscuits. 

Rub one pound of butter into three and one-half pounds of flour, mix in one and 
one-half breakfast cupfuls of sugar, and, when quite smooth, add six or eight drops 
of lemon essence, one teacupful of honey-water, and enough milk to form a thick 
dough. Divide the dough, after breaking it smooth, into pieces about the size of a 
walnut, flatten, cut out with a biscuit-cutter, place the biscuits on baking-sheets, and 
bake till colored lightly in a moderate oven. Leave the biscuits till cold, and keep 
them in a tin canister. 

Milk Biscuits. 

Rub one pound of salted butter into four quarts of the best wheat flour until 
quite smooth, add one pinch of salt, and stir the mixture to a paste with milk. 
Divide the dough into small equal portions, shape them into balls, prick the tops with 
a fork, put them into buttered-pans, and stand in a warm place to rise for about an 
hour. When very light, place the biscuits in a moderate oven and bake. When crisp 
and cooked, take the biscuits out of the tins, and leave them until cold. If they are 
to be kept for any time, they should be put into biscuit-tins. 

Oatmeal Biscuits. 

Mix with one pound of oatmeal half a pound of flour and one tablespoonful of 
baking-powder, rub in half a pound of butter, and, when it is smooth, stir in enough 
warm water to knead the whole into a paste, turn onto a table, and roll it out very 
thin. Cut the paste into rounds, lay them on a baking-sheet, and bake in the oven. 
When they are cooked, leave the biscuits -until they are cold, then pack them in 
biscuit-tins, and keep them in a dry cupboard. They are served at luncheon very 
often. 

Tea Biscuits. 

Mix in the following proportions the desired quantity: Rub six ounces of lard 
and a similar quantity of butter into five and a half pounds of flour; make a bay, and 
mix in two pounds of sifted sugar, and mix into a dough with one pint of milk and a 
half pint of water; mix in with the sugar a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda, and, 
with the water, a teaspoonful of hydrochloric acid. Allow the dough to become quite 
stiff, and break well with the biscuit-break; roll out thin, and cut into pieces with a 
round or oval cutter. Cover over, and leave in a warm place to rise; when it becomes 
puffy, place on buttered baking-sheets in a quick oven for twenty minutes. 

Wine Biscuits. 

Slightly warm four ounces of butter and beat it to a cream with a wineglassful 
of wine. Mix eight ounces of flour with eight ounces of crushed-sugar, then mix it 



792 BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 

to a paste with the wine and butter, stirring in also four well-beaten eggs. Sprinkle 
a few caraway-seeds into the mixture, work it till quite smooth, then turn it out on a 
floured-table arid roll it out as thin as possible. With a round tin-cutter one and one- 
half inches in diameter, cut some biscuits out of the flat of paste. Put the biscuits 
on a buttered baking-sheet, brush the tops over with beaten white of egg, dust some 
powdered-sugar over and bake in a quick oven for ten or twelve minutes. When 
cold, take them off the baking-sheet, and serve in a glass dish. Keep them in a bis- 
cuit-tin in a dry place. 

American Bread. 

Place in an earthen vessel which is wider at the top than at the bottom, a pound 
and a half of flour and half a pint of fresh brewers' yeast, mixing it with a pint of 
lukewarm water, when it may be set one side for three or four hours until it rises and 
falls again. Place a little salt in a couple of quarts of water and mix it well with the 
above and add about nine pounds of flour, work together well and leave it until light 
when it may be shaped into loaves. It should first be put into a hot oven, allowing 
it to cool afterwards. 

American Brown Bread. 

Mix together two parts flour and one part each of corn-flour, rye-meal and 
molasses, beat thoroughly and add a well-beaten egg; mix and pour into a buttered- 
tin holding about two quarts and let it steam in a slow oven for four hours, and then 
bake in a quick oven for half an hour. 



Take an equal quantity of corn-flour and rye-meal, a few tablespoonfuls of 
pumpkin, a little salt and a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda, half a cupful of yeast 
and a similar quantity of molasses, stirring in some warm water until it forms a paste. 
Have ready two well-buttered iron-pans and pour in this mixture, smooth the top 
with the hand, and when it has risen, bake in an oven quickly. 

Corn Bread. 

Scald the desired amount of white cornmeal and mix with it an egg and two 
tablespoonfuls of melted lard to each breakfast cupful of meal used and a little milk 
or cold water, with an equal quantity of hot water, a teaspoonful of baking-powder 
and a little salt, beat all together thoroughly; pour this batter into a hot, ungreased 
pan and bake for half an hour quickly. 

Dyspepsia Bread. 

Mix the desired quantity of unsifted wheat meal with some soft warm water, with 
a quarter of that amount of molasses and fresh yeast, a teaspoonful of carbonate of 
ammonia, and shape into loaves and bake for an hour. 



BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 793 

Egg Bread. 

Take an equal amount each of rice and hominy, mash them .well together and 
add the yolks of some eggs well beaten with a little flour and some sweet milk, with 
a lump of butter. Whisk the whites of the eggs well and, just before forming into 
loaves, add them. Bake until done in a quick oven. 

Gluten Bread. 

Mix a pound and a half of fresh, moist gluten, three and a quarter drachms of 
bicarbonate of ammonia, a little salt and some powdered caraway and four and a half 
ounces of wheaten flour, an ounce and a quarter of powdered bran and four ounces of 
salt butter. Mix well and place in flat tin pans; bake on a moderately heated hearth. 

Graham Flour Bread. 

Mix six breakfast cupfuls of Graham flour with a little sugar and salt, half a 
cupful of yeast, and work to a dough, adding a pint of scalded milk (cool), and 
make a little softer than white bread. Raise till light and then stir down, pour it into 
well-greased pans, or, if stiff enough, shape into loaves, let it rise again and bake a 
little longer in a slightly cooler oven than that used for white bread. Graham flour 
rises more quickly than white bread. 

Household Bread. 

Mix in following proportions: Ten pounds of best flour into half a gallon of 
water; when well mixed add half a pint of yeast, knead, cover it over and place in a 
warm place to rise. Make it into loaves or rolls and bake. 

Bread Made with Potatoes. 

Mash some boiled potatoes while hot, adding a little tepid water and an ounce or 
so of German yeast and some flour. Let this ferment in a warm place for six hours, 
and place in a pan with flour and a little salt, mixing the whole into a dough. Stand 
for another three hours to rise, make into loaves and bake as quickly as possible. 

Oatmeal Bread. 

Rub a quarter of a pound of butter into a pound and a half of flour and when it 
is smooth mix in two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar, a saltspoonful of salt and half a 
pound of oatmeal. When they are thoroughly mixed make a well in the center, in 
which place two tablespoonfuls of brewers' yeast, cover this over with a cloth and 
stand to rise for an hour. Afterward work the mixture up with enough warm milk 



794 BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 

to form a dough, divide it into portions and mould it into cakes. When they are 
cooked split the cakes open, butter them, close them again, put them on a hot dish, 
and serve quickly. 

Pulled Bread. 

Pull the pieces of crumb from a loaf of bread and place in the oven to brown. 
These may be stored in tins, but are considered better when quite fresh. 

Brioche. 

Prepare a sponge of German yeast dissolved in a little warm water, and mix it 
with enough flour to form a batter. When it has risen to twice its original size, place 
it one side and put on a paste-board a pound of flour, make a bay in the center and in 
it put a pound of warmed fresh butter, a teacupful of milk, ten eggs, a little salt and 
the sponge, and work together, adding flour as needed. Place it in a basin with a 
cover and stand it in a warm temperature for three hours. Then roll out and fold 
three times in succession; remove about a quarter of the paste, making the remainder 
round and slightly flattened at the top, wet the bottom of the smaller piece of paste, 
making a ball of that also, flatten it and put on top of the larger one; then glaze over 
with a paste-brush dipped in beaten egg, set on a buttered tin and bake in a quick 
oven for three-quarters of an hour. 

Brioches Flutes. 

Make the brioche paste and lay it on a floured board and cut it into a dozen equal 
pieces. Roll each one separately with the hands until about ten inches in length, 
rounding into shape. Place on a baking-dish and leave in a hot closet for ten min- 
utes to rise, then take out and glaze lightly with beaten eggs, sprinkle with powdered 
sugar and put in the oven for ten minutes, and serve on a dish with a folded napkin. 



Brioche Ring. 



Dissolve in a teacupful of warm water a half ounce of German yeast and mix 
into a stiff paste with about half a pound of flour; put in a pan with a little warm 
water on the bottom to prevent sticking, cover and place in a warm place to rise. 
Mix together half a pound of flour, about eight ounces of butter, three eggs, a 
little salt and sugar, and work thoroughly with the hands for twelve minutes or 
so; after which add three eggs gradually when quite smooth and soft and work 
in the dough for ten to twelve minutes. Pull into small pieces, put in a basin 
and let it rise in a warm temperature to nearly double its original size; then beat 
it well with floured hands on a floured table, flatten and fold it several times and put 
it in a basin in a cool place for several hours. Then roll it once more and again 
place in a cool place for one hour. When quite firm shape into a ball, place on a 



BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 795 

baking-sheet, flatten it and form a hollow in the center, making a ring; glaze it and 
bake in a hot oven for twenty-five minutes. 

Buns. 

Mix half a pound each of butter and sugar with three pounds of sifted flour, 
rubbing them together thoroughly, and add a pound of currants washed and dried, 
some caraway seed and three ounces of yeast and set the paste to rise for half an 
hour. Mix well and let the dough stand again until it is well risen; then roll out 
and shape into small cakes, place these on greased baking-sheets in a hot oven, and 
bake until done. 

Hot Cross Buns. 

Add to a quart of warmed new milk half a pound of flour, a couple of eggs, and 
dissolve in it two ounces of German yeast. Stir this mixture well together, cover 
over the pan and set it in a warm place to rise. After it has risen and again fallen 
mix with it four pounds of flour previously rubbed with a pound of butter, a half 
pound more of the sugar and half an ounce of mixed spice, using enough flour to 
make a stiff dough; then set it once again in a warm place to rise, having it well cov- 
ered with a cloth. When it has risen to nearly double its original proportions shape 
with the hands into balls and place them on a buttered baking-tin, leaving space 
enough between them to prevent their becoming joined. Set them one side for a 
few minutes and then cut across on the tops in the shape of a cross, brush over with 
a little milk and again set to one side. After the lapse of a few minutes more place 
in a hot oven and bake. When they are done brush the tops with milk, and serve. 



Light Tea Buns. 



One pound of flour, half a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda and an equal 
amount of tartaric acid should be placed together in a bowl, mixed thoroughly and 
then rubbed through a sieve; then rub in a couple of ounces of butter, until it is quite 
absorbed, add a little sugar and a quarter of a pound of currants, well washed and 
dried, a teaspoonful of caraway seed, and then beat an egg into a pint of milk, mix 
the flour into it. Butter some baking-tins, place the dough on them in small lumps, 
and bake in a hot oven. 

Cornmeal Crackers. 

Put two pounds of cornmeal into a basin and work in four tablespoonfuls of 
warmed fat or butter ; then mix in one pound of sugar, pour in gradually one break- 
fast cupful of milk, and add enough wheat-flour to form a stiff dough. After knead- 
ing it well, allow it to stand for two or three hours in a warm place. Take up small 
pieces of the dough about the size of a walnut, shape them like shells, brown them in 
boiling fat, and serve on a dish with a folded napkin, or ornamental paper. 



79 6 BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 

Graham Flour Crackers. 

Mix one quart of graham flour and one breakfast cupful of Indian meal and one 
teaspoonful of salt, and stir in sufficient water to make a stiff dough. Roll this out 
very thin, cut it into squares, and lay them on a baking-sheet; dock them and bake 
in a quick oven. The crackers may be sweetened if desired. 

Lemon-Flavored Crackers. 

Mix one and a quarter pounds of butter with about thirteen pounds of flour, 
make a bay, and stir in two and one-fourth pounds of sugar, one ounce of ammonia, 
one-fourth ounce of essence of lemon, and three pints of water. Work well together, 
roll out the paste, cut it into small rounds, put them on a baking-sheet, and bake 
in a moderate oven. Remove when done, and use when cold. The quantity given is 
useful for confectioners. 

Soda Crackers. 

These are made by adding from one to two teaspoonfuls of bicarbonate of soda 
to either of the foregoing recipes, or in the following way: Make three-quarters of a 
pound of flour into a very stiff dough with sour milk in which one saltspoonful of 
bicarbonate of soda has been dissolved; work into this one dessertspoonful of lard 
mixed with butter; beat it well and roll it out very thin. Prick well with a fork and 
bake in a moderate oven. 



Almond Cracklings. 



Take six parts of blanched almonds to four of ground almonds, together with 
sifted sugar equal to the quantity of almonds used, the whites of some eggs and add 
a few drops of essence of vanilla. Mix them together in a basin and se a dessert- 
spoon to lay out pieces the size of a walnut upon a sheet of paper, spread or baking- 
plates. The cracklings should be placed an inch and a half apart and be slightly 
spread out with the tip of the finger dipped in water. The circular form may be 
preserved, and quarter of an inch is sufficient thickness. Bake until of a light-brown 
color in a moderately hot oven. 



Philadelphia Cracknels. 



Blanch one-half pound of sweet almonds, put them in a mortar, pound and mix 
in six well-beaten eggs, one at a time. Warm slightly one pound of butter and stir 
it well into one pound of caster-sugar; grate the yellow rind of two lemons, add them 
to the butter and sugar and then mix the whole in with the pounded almonds. Sift 
one pound of flour onto a paste-board, then mix in with it the almond paste and knead 
it well. Dredge a little flour over the paste and roll it out, cut into any desired 



BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 797 

shapes, brush them over with a paste-brush dipped in the beaten yolk of an egg and 
sprinkle over with caster-sugar. Place the cracknels on a buttered baking-tin and 
bake them in a moderate oven till lightly browned, then remove. Care must be ex- 
ercised to see that they do not burn. 

Crumpets. 

Put two ounces of flour in a basin; dissolve one ounce of German yeast in one 
quart of warm milk, add one teaspoonful of salt, and when the yeast is dissolved, 
mix the flour with the milk; when it is quite smooth, throw a cloth over the pan and 
let the batter rise in a warm place, this will take about three-quarters of an hour. 
Place in the oven, until quite hot, a stone slab which should be about one inch thick 
and the size of an ordinary baking-sheet; when the slab is hot, oil it with butter, put 
some tin hoops also oiled in rows onto it; take out carefully large spoonfuls of the 
batter and put one in each hoop; shut the oven quickly and bake the crumpets in a 
sharp heat. When they are done on one side, remove the hoops and turn the crumpets 
over that they may bake on the other side. 

Flannel Crumpets. 

Put one pound of sifted flour into a pan, mix into it one saltspoonful of salt, and 
put it in front of the fire; warm half a pint of milk, and with it mix the flour into a 
smooth batter. Beat up two eggs well, and stir them into three dessertspoonfuls of 
fresh yeast, or two dessertspoonfuls of dissolved German yeast, beat the mixed yeast 
and eggs into the batter. If the batter is stiff add a little more milk. Cover over 
the pan and set it near the fire until it rises well; then pour a ladleful of it onto a hot 
and greased baking-iron and bake slowly. When one side is done, turn and do the 
other side. Butter the crumpets, cut, and serve hot. 

Gluten Gems. 

Put two breakfast cupfuls of gluten into a basin, mix into it one egg, two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, a saltspoonful of salt and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and 
make it into a light paste with one pint of milk or water. Put the mixture into well- 
buttered small tins; bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. 

Wheatmeal Gems. 

Put two and one-half breakfast cupfuls of fine, granulated wheat into a basin 
with one saltspoonful of salt, and stir in gradually one breakfast cupful of milk and 
one breakfast cupful of water. Beat the batter as long and as quickly as possible. 
Butter some iron gem-pans, make them very hot, and fill them quickly with the batter, 
beating it briskly several times during the turning; place them in a hot oven, and 
bake. Serve either hot or cold.

Muffins. 

f 

Pour into a basin one breakfast cupful of milk that has been boiled, and mix in 

two tablespoonfuls of sugar, the yolk and white of an egg, one teaspoonful of salt, 
and one half teacupful of yeast, adding sufficient flour to make a light batter. Place 
the basin in front of the fire in order that the batter may rise, leave it there for about 
six hours, then put in one and one-half teaspoonfuls of warmed butter, and thoroughly 
mix together. Have in readiness some muffin-rings, fill them two-thirds full of the 
batter, let them rise again for a quarter of an hour, then bake them in a hot oven 
until done. They may also be baked in muffin rings on a griddle, in which case the 
melted butter must be added at the beginning, and the rings and griddle well 
greased. Take up a spoonful of the batter without allowing any of the air bubbles to 
escape, fill up the rings, and when the muffins are cooked, browned, and have well 
risen, turn the muffin with the ring and brown on the opposite side. They should be 
pulled apart, and not cut when required for use. 

Muffins, French Style. 

Dissolve a medium-sized cake of yeast in warm water, put one ounce of butter 
into a saucepan with one-half pint of milk, and warm; beat four eggs until they are 
frothy, then stir them in with the milk. Mix the yeast with the eggs and milk, and 
stir in gradually one quart of flour. Butter or lard some muffin rings, and set them 
on a greased baking-dish, pour some of the batter into each, and set them in a warm 
place to rise. When well risen, bake the muffins lightly in a moderate oven. If they 
are to be served hot with butter inside them, they should be pulled asunder, as cutting 
them with a knife will make them heavy. 

Rice Muffins. 

Put one quart of flour into a basin, mix in one teaspoonful each of salt and bi- 
carbonate of soda, and two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar; then add two tablespoon- 
fuls of sifted crushed loaf-sugar, and pass the whole through a fine wire sieve into a 
basin. Stir in by degrees two eggs beaten up in one breakfast cupful of milk, and 
work well until the paste is light and smooth. Then add two breakfast cupfuls of 
cold boiled rice. Turn the preparation into well-buttered tins, place them in the oven 
and bake. When done, take them out, and serve them either hot or cold. 

Rye Muffins. 

Put three breakfast cupfuls of sifted rye-meal into a large bowl, and add an equal 
quantity of flour, one teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda, two teaspoonfuls of cream 
of tartar, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, all rubbed

together through a sieve. Beat thoroughly two eggs, mix in one breakfast cupful of 
milk, stir this into the dry mixture, and work it to a rather stiff paste. Dip a table- 
spoon in cold milk, fill it with the batter, drop it into boiling fat in a fryingpan, and 
fry for about ten minutes. Take out the muffins as they are done, drain them, place 
them on a napkin spread over a dish, and serve. They may also be made with one 
and one-half breakfast cupfuls of rye-meal and flour in equal quantities. 

Toasted Muffins. 

Take a quantity of muffins, pull open the side (never cut them), and toast them 
before a clear fire. When done, pull them apart, when both halves should be of an 
equal thickness. Put a little butter on each piece, close them together again, place 
them on a hot plate with a cover, cut them into quarters, and serve very hot. 

American Rolls. 

Place the desired amount of sifted flour in a deep bowl, make a hollow in the 
middle, and put in some lukewarm milk, a little butter dissolved in the milk, a little 
salt and sugar and two gills of yeast, mix in enough flour to make a firm, smooth 
batter, cover the bowl, and put it in a warm place until the batter is light and foamy, 
then mix in some more flour, knead the dough for five minutes, again cover it, and 
let it stand until twice its original size. When the dough is light, roll and cut into 
thick rounds, set two together, and bake in a quick oven until browned. 

Butter Rolls for Tea. 

Put half a pound of light bread dough into a basin, mix in a little sugar, a lump 
of butter, the yolk of an egg and half a teacupful of cream, together with some flour. 
Let it rise in a warm temperature for a couple of hours, then knead well on a floured 
table for several minutes until the dough is full of air bubbles and of a light and 
silky appearance. Make into round balls, and when all are finished, lay them flat, 
brush half of them with melted butter, and put the other half on top, press in the 
center, and brush over the surfaces with melted butter, setting them one side to rise 
again. Then put them in a moderate oven, and bake them for fifteen or twenty min- 
utes; take out, cut into halves, butter them inside, and serve hot. 

French Rolls. 

Mix a quart of flour with a little salt and two eggs, a tablespoonful of lard and 
two of yeast, with enough milk to make a good dough, work it well, and set out to 
rise for the night. In the morning, work it thoroughly again and form into rolls; let 
these rise again, and bake in a quick oven. 



8oo BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 

Milk Rolls. 

Scald one-half pint of milk without allowing it to boil, then let it cool, and when 
cold, stir into it one-fourth pound of flour and one tablespoonful of sugar mixed with 
two tablespoonfuls of yeast. Put three-fourths of a pound of flour and a very little 
salt into a basin, make a hollow in the center, and pour in the mixture. Cover, and 
let it stand in a moderately-warm place all night. The next day, work in one ounce 
of warm butter, and allow it to stand for six hours in a warm place. Form the dough 
into oblong rolls, lay them in a baking-tin far enough apart so they will not run 
together, and let them stand for three hours longer, then bake them in a quick oven, 
and glaze with the white of an egg. 

Tea or Breakfast Rolls. 

Sift out a pound of flour on a table and rub into it four ounces of butter ; make 
a hollow in the center, work in one egg and a tablespoonful of yeast dissolved in a 
little warmed milk ; set to rise in a warm place. Then form a light dough and let it 
rise once again, in front of the fire; shape into rolls, place in front of the fire again 
for ten minutes or so, brush them over with egg, and bake in a moderate oven for 
fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Vienna Rolls. 

Dissolve a cupful of German yeast in a quart of lukewarm milk, stirring in a 
pound of fine flour, and allow it to sponge; then add a little salt, moist sugar, and 
make into a stiff dough; allow it to rise for four hours, and then work it well on a 
table or board rolling it out to about an eighth of an inch in thickness; cut into 
strips about six inches in width; these should be cut into long triangles not very wide 
at the base. Roll them up commencing at the bottom, and the top of the triangle 
will come in the center of the roll. Roll a little with the hands and then place in a 
baking-dish, and brush it over with melted lard or butter. Let it rise on the pan for 
half an hour, and then bake for ten minutes or until it has become lightly colored. 

Oatmeal Wafers. 

Mix a small quantity of salt into eight ounces of oatmeal flour, and make it into 
a dough by adding one teacupful of boiling water, Turn it onto a board well 
sprinkled with meal, knead it slightly, roll it out as thin as possible, cut it into shapes, 
brown first one side and then the other, and when they are crisp they are ready 
for use. 

Graham Flour Wafers. 

Take two breakfast cupfuls each of graham and wheat flour, put into a basin and 
rub one and a half teacupfuls of butter into it; when quite smooth, add a saltspoonful 



BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 801 

of salt and three-quarters of a breakfast cupful of sugar, stirring in gradually sufficient 
water to make a stiff dough. Sprinkle some flour over the table, place the dough 
on it, roll it out very thin, and then cut it into squares. Butter a baking-sheet, lay 
the squares of dough on it, and bake in a quick oven. 

Zweibach. 

Beat six eggs together with three ounces of powdered sugar; mix one-fourth 
pint of fresh yeast in one-half pint of slightly warmed milk, then add one-fourth 
pound of warmed butter. Stir in gradually with the above ingredients sufficient flour 
to form a stiff paste, stirring it continually and mixing it very smoothly. Place a 
cloth over the pan and place it in a warm temperature until the dough has risen to 
twice its original height. Sprinkle a little flour over the dough and spread it well 
with the hands; it should not be too stiff. Divide this into several small portions, 
and shape them into long and rather narrow cakes about one inch in thickness. 
Place the Zweibach on a buttered baking-tin, brush them over with a paste-brush 
dipped in milk, and bake them. When cooked, leave the cakes until the following 
day, then split them open, lay them out flat, the crust part underneath, and stand 
them in a moderate oven again until yellow and crisp. These cakes may be eaten 
with butter while hot, if liked, or left until cold, and eaten as dry as a biscuit. 

Breakfast Cakes. 

Dissolve in half a pint of warm milk half an ounce of German yeast, and stir in 
enough flour to make a batter; stand to rise, and then warm a quarter of a pound of 
butter, mixing it with a little milk and a teaspoonful of salt, together with the yolks 
of eight eggs; beat up well and make into a dough, with the remainder of two pounds 
of flour, knead lightly and form into cakes about two inches in thickness, place them 
in well-buttered hoops, laying the hoops on greased baking-sheets, and when the 
dough is nicely risen, place in a warm oven and bake. When cooked, cut into thick 
slices, and butter. 

Buckwheat Cakes. 

Heat a pint of water, add half a pint of buckwheat flour and a teacupful of yeast, 
and let it stand for several hours to sponge. Then add a couple of spoonfuls of 
melted lard, the same quantity of syrup, a little salt, and mix thoroughly. Make into 
thin cakes and bake on a griddle. 

Coffee Cakes. 

Boil until soft one pound of rice, mixing with it two pounds of flour and half a 
pound of fine cornmeal, a teacupful of fresh yeast, and moisten with cold water. Let 
the dough rise over night, then make into small cakes and bake on a well-buttered 
baking-sheet. 



8o2 BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 

Cornmeal Butter Cakes. 

Place one pound of cornmeal in a basin with one-half pound of wheat-flour, one 
teaspoonful of baking-powder and one pinch of salt. Stir slowly into the above in- 
gredients one quart of milk, or milk reduced with water, and then add one teacupful 
of melted lard. When well mixed and smooth, spread the mixture out on iron plates 
in thin cakes and cook them over a slow fire. When done on one side, turn and 
cook the other. These cakes are very palatable when served hot. 

Flannel Cakes. 

Mix with two pounds of flour, half a dozen well-beaten eggs, half a teacupful of 
yeast and a little salt with enough milk to form a thick batter, and set one side to 
rise. Bake in small well-greased tins. 

Griddle Cakes. 

Rub together a pound of flour, three ounces of butter, a little salt and make it 
into a paste with some sweet buttermilk; roll it out and cut with a biscuit-cutter into 
cakes which are baked on a griddle. 

Oatmeal Cakes (Small). 

Mix a little bicarbonate of soda and salt in with a little oatmeal and rub it in 
four ounces of lard. Add one teacupful of water to make it into a dough, turn onto 
a board sprinkled with meal, and knead it slightly. Roll it out, cut it into rounds, 
put them on the griddle and when they are done on one side, turn them over to 
brown on the other. They are then ready for use or may be put away in tin boxes 
and kept in a dry place; in the latter case they should again be made crisp by hold- 
ing them in front of the fire before serving. 

Oatmeal Gruel. 

Mix two tablespoonfuls of oatmeal to a paste by adding three tablespoonfuls of 
water; stir in three breakfast cupfuls of milk or water, pour it into a saucepan over a 
slow fire, and cook for half an hour. When it is done turn it into a basin, and serve. 
It may be strained if thought necessary. 

Wheat Flour Gruel. 

Mix one tablespoonful of salt in two tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir it into a 
smooth, thin paste with cold water; then mix in by degrees one breakfast cupful of 
boiling water, turn the mixture into a saucepan and stir it over the fire until well 



BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 803 

cooked, which will take about five minutes. Strain the gruel, sweeten it to taste, and 
if too thick, thin it with a little milk. The gruel may either be flavored with lemon 
juice or grated nutmeg, or a small piece of stick cinnamon may be boiled with it. 

Cracked- Wheat Mush (American). 

Brush lightly over the inside of a flat-bottomed, iron saucepan with a paste brush 
dipped in lard it will require but little pour in two quarts of water, and stand it 
over the fire. When boiling stir in one breakfast cupful of cracked wheat, and one 
teaspoonful of salt, keep stirring over the fire, and boil it for ten minutes; then move 
the saucepan to the side and keep the contents simmering, with the lid on, for three 
hours. As it is not the wheat itself that burns, but the flour mixed up with it, it 
would be better to wash it in two or three waters before boiling, as is done with rice. 
When sufficiently cooked, turn the mush into a bowl, and serve with a jug of cream. 

Graham-Flour Mush. 

Put one breakfast cupful of Graham flour into a basin with a teaspoonful of salt 
and form it into a smooth paste with a small quantity of cold water; then mix in 
gradually nearly one quart of boiling water. Turn the whole into a saucepan and 
boil it for twenty minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon> When cooked 
turn the mush onto a dish, and serve it with cream and sugar. 

Oatmeal Mush 

Put one breakfast cupful of coarse oatmeal into the top part of a double boiler 
with a teaspoonful of salt and nearly one quart of boiling water, boil over the fire for 
ten minutes, stirring all the time with a wooden fork. At the end of that time place 
the upper boiler in the one containing hot water and cook for an hour if preferred 
soft, but if liked dry, cook for three hours. Just before serving remove the cover 
from the top boiler, stir the contents once and leave it for a .few minutes so that the 
steam may escape. 

Cracked- Wheat Porridge. 

Brush over the inside of a flat-bottomed saucepan with a small quantity of 
melted lard. Pour in four pints of water to boil, stir in one breakfast cupful of 
cracked wheat and one teaspoonful of salt; stir the wheat and boil it for a few min- 
utes, then push the saucepan to the side of the fire, place the lid on and allow the 
contents to simmer for four hours. When cooked turn the porridge into a bowl and 
serve it with a jug of cream. The wheat should be well washed before being cooked 
to rid it of the flour, which is generally the cause of burning. 



804 BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 



Milk Porridge. 



Take one tablespoonful of flour, mix it quite smooth with one breakfast cupful 
of water, taking care to see that there are no lumps left; put this into a good thick 
saucepan and add to it one breakfast cupful of milk, one teaspooriful of salt and a 
small quantity of grated nutmeg. Place it on the stove and keep stirring until it 
boils; allow it to boil for ten minutes or so, and it is then ready to serve. 



Rice Porridge. 



Put one-half pound of rice into three quarts of boiling water and let it swell until 
it is quite a jelly, then add to it one-fourth pound of oatmeal mixed with water and 
stir it well in; add also one ounce of finely-chopped onion, pepper and salt to taste, 
and one-half ounce of bacon fat, lard or butter, and boil all together, stirring con- 
tinually. If desired the quantity of oatmeal may be larger; it may even be the same 
as the rice. 

Cream Toasts. 

Cut some slices of bread, about one-third of an inch in thickness, and trim off 
the crusts. Have ready on the fire a bowl half full of boiling water with about one 
ounce of butter in it; toast the slices of bread a pale brown, and as each slice is done 
dip it in the boiling water and butter for a second, sprinkle on a little salt and lay it 
in a deep, hot dish (the one in which it is to be served). Pour one quart of milk 
into a saucepan and set it on the fire, thicken with one ounce of cornmeal, stir in two 
ounces of butter, let it simmer until all the toasts are ready and stir into it the whites 
of three or four eggs (which should have been beaten to a stiff froth before the bread 
was cut). Allow this to come just to the boil and pour it over the toast, lifting the 
slices one by one to let the mixture run in between them. Cover the dish well and 
put it in the oven for two or three minutes, just prior to serving. 



Egg Toasts. 



Beat together one egg, one breakfast cupful of milk and a pinch of salt, soak in 
this six small slices of stale bread, and when soft put them on a well-buttered griddle 
and brown on both sides. These make a very good dish for tea, served hot. They 
should be eaten with butter. 

Milk Toast. 

Toast slices of stale bread to a delicate color; meanwhile heat to the boiling point 
a sufficient quantity of milk to saturate the toast, adding two tablespoonfuls of butter 
to each pint of milk. When the milk boils, pour it over the toast, and serve at once. 
The boiling milk may be thickened with a little flour. 



BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES. 805 

French Toast. 

Beat up a little egg, salt and milk in a basin and dip some thin slices of bread into 
this, covering well on both sides, then plunge the bread into a fryingpan of boiling 
fat and fry to a light brown. Remove, drain them, and they are ready for serving. 



Teas, Coffees, Etc. 



Chocolate. 

Chocolate may be bought in cakes and may be had either sweet or plain. Allow 
one ounce to a cupful. Grate the chocolate and melt it over the fire in a cupful of 
water, stirring until the chocolate is dissolved; then add a cupful of milk, keeping on 
stirring until it boils, when it is ready for use. 

Cocoa. 

(1) Mix three tablespoonfuls of prepared cocoa with one pint of water and 
one pint of milk, let it boil for twenty minutes, whipping all the time with an egg- 
whisk. 

(2) Put one teaspoonful of cocoa into a cup, add a little boiling milk and 
stir to a paste and sweeten to taste. If preferred, the cup may be nearly filled with 
water before adding milk. 

Black Coffee. 

Grind six tablespoonfuls of coffee-beans in a mill. Put the coffee on the filter 
with the strainer over, and pour on three cupfuls of boiling water. Put on the cover 
and let it infuse, but do not let it boil again. 

(2.) Put three pints of cold water in an earthen pot on the range, and when it 
boils add four and a half ounces of ground coffee, then place the pot on the corner of 
the stove and let it boil for three minutes. Take a small piece of charcoal, hot, and 
put in the coffee. Let this stand for three minutes and then remove the skimmer 
from the top of the coffee. 

(3.) Pour one quart of boiling water on one cupful of coffee, stir and let stand 
in a warm place for fifteen minutes, or boil for five minutes. 

Breakfast Coffee. 

Allow one tablespoonful of coffee to each person. The coffee when ground 
should be measured, put in the pot, and boiling water poured over it in the proportion 
of three-quarters of a pint to each tablespoonful. The instant it boils take the pot 
off, uncover and let it stand a minute or two; then cover, put it back in the fire and 
boil again. Let it stand for five minutes to settle; it is then ready to pour out. 

806 



TEAS, COFFEES, ETC. 807 

Iced Coffee. 

Prepare a quart of coffee as for Black Coffee, and have also a quart of well 
heated milk, but not boiled, and pour the coffee and milk into an ice-cream freezer, 
sweeten with a little powdered sugar, cover the freezer and place it in a tub of ice 
and rock-salt, a little higher than the pot of coffee, then turn the handle of the cover 
in various directions for five minutes, and serve in coffee glasses with powdered sugar 
separately. 

Mazagrau. 

Make the coffee exactly as for Black Coffee and have half a dozen goblets half 
filled with clear ice, pour in the coffee and add a pony of cognac to each glass, mix- 
ing well with a spoon, and then serve. 

Method of Roasting Coffee. 

Procure a small coffee-roaster and have in readiness a pound of Java, thoroughly 
mixed with a pound of Mocha, put it into the roaster, remove one of the lids from the 
stove, and place the roaster over a moderate fire, then turn the handle constantly but 
slowly until the coffee acquires a good brown color, say about twenty-five minutes or 
so: when done transfer it to an earthenware jar, cover tightly, and it is ready for use 
when required. 

Coffee with Whipped Cream. 

Pour into each cup enough sugar to properly sweeten the coffee, and one table- 
spoonful or a little more of boiling milk. Have prepared some whipped cream, one 
pint whisked to a froth being required for a dozen cups of coffee. Fill the cups 
partly full with hot coffee, lay on top of each a spoonful or two of the whipped 
cream, stir it gently, and serve. 

Tea: How Made. 

Black, green and Oolong tea are prepared as follows. First, never allow the 
teapot or other utensils kept for the preparation of tea to be used for any other pur- 
pose, and they should always be kept scrupulously clean. Place one ounce of tea 
in a teapot, with two gills of boiling water, and infuse for ten minutes, then add to 
this eight gills of boiling water, and after the lapse of a few minutes, stir with a tea- 
spoon and allow it to stand. It should be served with sugar and cream. 

Iced Tea, French Style. 

Place in a teapot three tablespoonfuls of tea, pour over two and one-half quarts 
of boiling water, and turn it into a freezer. Sweeten with three tablespoonfuls of 



8o8 TEAS, COFFEES, ETC. 

sugar, tightly cover the freezer, place it in a tub containing broken ice and salt a 
little higher than the height of the tea, turn it sharply by the handle, all round in 
different directions for five or six minutes, wipe the cover of the freezer well, to pre- 
vent any ice falling in, and with the aid of a ladle pour it into a cold pitcher or jar. 
Send to the table in glasses with slices of lemon, and sugar separately. 

Russian Tea. 

Pour little water over three heaping tablespoonfuls of English breakfast-tea in 
a tea pot. The water should be boiling and just sufficient to cover the tea; let it in- 
fuse for a minute or two, then draw the water off. Next pour in half a pony of 
Jamaica rum, together with three pints of boiling water, infuse for four minutes and 
serve in a cup, with a decanter of old Jamaica rum separately, with thin slices of 
lemon and some powdered sugar. 



Confectionery. 

Sugar Boiling. 



Considerable attention to this art should be directed by those who desire to 
note the changes that take place in sugar at different degrees of heat, the expres- 
sions, "Boil to the crack," "To the pearl," "To the thread," "To the blow," etc., 
must be well understood and the simple method of determining these various 
conditions should be committed to memory. 

Previous to explaining the "degrees" of sugar boiling it will be best to describe 
suitable vessels for holding the sugar and stoves for supplying the requisite heat. 
Sugar boilers or pans are made in a number of shapes from the old-fashioned Scotch 
saucepan, or "goblet," to the deep round pan, which finds the greatest favor among 
confectioners, whether for large or for small quantities, the pan being large or small 
accordingly. The stove used for receiving the pan should be fitted with a ring for 
the round, dome bottom of the pan to rest in, and the heat may be derived from 
either fuel or gas. 

Another necessary implement is a marble pouring-plate, which should be laid on 
a table and supplied with different-sized frames. All skilled sugar boilers advise 
the use of a thermometer graduated from 50 degrees Fahrenheit to 350 degrees 
Fahrenheit, but, nevertheless, very few skilled boilers use them; they are so well 
accustomed to jndge of the degree to which the sugar has arrived by very simple 
tests, which will be described further on. It is observed that while the sugar is 
undergoing the process of boiling it is very nearly impossible for a learner to deter- 
mine the exact degree which the sugar has attained without the aid of the thermome- 
ter, and even the journeyman confectioner finds it very useful. 

Place in the pan seven pounds of loaf sugar broken into small pieces (white 
crystallized sugar will answer the same purpose), and add one quart of water; set the 
pan over the fire and allow its contents to boil. As soon as the bubbles show on the 
surface, lift the pan from the fire and examine the contents to see whether the sugar 
all is dissolved; stir with a spatula and crush any lumps that may remain. Place it 
again over the fire, putting a cover over the pan, and in ten minutes remove the cover 
and put in the thermometer, being careful that the lower portion of it shall be 
thoroughly imbedded in the sugar. 

When the thermometer indicates 215 degrees to 220 degrees the degree called 
"smooth" is reached and the sugar is well adapted for crystallizing and making gum 
goods and liqueurs. At 230 degrees to 235 degrees "thread" it is used for liqueurs. 
Two hundred and forty to 245 degrees "feather" or "blow" quickly follows, requir- 

809

ing very close attention to the pan in order to avoid having the sugar boil over; this 
condition is suitable for candying fruits and for making fondants and creams. Two 
hundred and fifty degrees to 255 degrees, "ball" or "pearl," serves for cocoanut and 
other candies, cocoanut ice and grain sugars generally. Three hundred and ten de- 
grees to 315 degrees, "crack," is required for all kinds of drops, rocks, taffies, and 
clear goods. 

The hand test for these various "degrees" is not very satisfactory, although it is 
marvelous with what accuracy an experienced confectioner will judge of their arrival. 
He dips a clay-pipe-stem into the sugar when it is boiling and draws it between the 
finger and thumb; if the sugar feels oily it has reached the "smooth" degree (215 
to 220 degrees). When the sugar forms small threads between the finger and thumb 
as they are opened out it has reached the "thread" degree (230 to 235 degrees), 
which may be either small or large. The "feather" degree (240 to 245 degrees), 
so quickly follows the thread that no test is necessary, although a toss of a little 
sugar in the air will show the feathered appearance. The "ball" degree (250 degrees 
to 255 degrees) is tested by dipping the sugar on a pipe stem and plunging into some 
cold water, and when you take it out the sugar should work up like putty. The 
"crack" (310 degrees to 315 degrees) is the most important degree of them all, as it 
is most generally wanted. When the pipe-stem is withdrawn from the sugar, as in 
testing for the "ball," the sugar should harden readily and snap off when bitten by 
the teeth. The next degree is called "caramel" and means that the sugar is on the 
point of burning. 

It is well, before proceeding further, to make some reference to what confection- 
ers term "cutting the grain" of sugar. Refined sugar, whether lump or crystal, 
when boiled to any degree above the "ball," or 250 degrees by the thermometer, is 
graining and would, if it were turned out into a pan, become a solid lump of hard, 
candied sugar, and to prevent this the grain must be cut by the addition of cream of 
tartar, which, in its action, will cause the sugar to become pliable while hot and trans- 
parent when it becomes cold; therefore it is necessary to use cream of tartar with 
all sugars intended for drops, rocks, taffies and clear goods. Some sugar workers 
prefer to use crystallized acetic, or citric acid, but cream of tartar is the best, 
safest and most to be relied upon, the quantity varying from one to two teaspoonfuls 
for a. seven-pound boil of sugar. 

Sugar may be grained by boiling it to the "ball" degree, then, without adding 
the cream of tartar or other acid, working it with the spatula against the side of the 
boiler until the sugar becomes opaque. This sometimes requires considerable perse- 
verance in order to bring it to a satisfactory condition. 

With the knowledge as above outlined the confectioner should be prepared of 
commence manufacturing, and here his personal adeptness and ingenuity will have 
to serve him. 

Rock is made by pouring the sugar into flat, rectangular, round or oval tins; 
drops, balls and lozenges can be made by passing the cooling sugar through a ma- 



CONFECTIONERY. 81 1 

chine with cutting rollers or by pulling it into long rods over a hook and then cut- 
ting the pieces off with scissors in such a manner as to have the edges formed cross 
or lie horizontally as in cushions; and by means of the scissors numerous shapes can 
be cut out, such as diamonds, squares, wedges, triangles, etc. 

Chocolate Bonbons. 

Put half a pound of French chocolate in a sugar-boiler, and stand on the stove 
till the chocolate is soft. Dissolve half an ounce of gum arabic in a tablespoonful 
and a half of hot water, mix it with the softened chocolate, stir until the chocolate is 
smooth, then mix in two ounces of fine icing sugar. When well mixed, drop the 
chocolate from the spout of the sugar-boiler cutting it off with a piece of wire into 
pieces the size of Brazilian nuts. When the bonbons are dry, pack them in paper in 
cardboard boxes. 

Orange-Flower Bonbons in Cases. 

Put twelve ounces of loaf sugar into a sugar-boiler, and boil to 38 degrees (see 
Syrups). When it is cool, grain it with a spatula until it is perfectly white, then add 
one ounce of candied orange-flowers, working them well in, fill some paper-cases with 
the mixture, and put them in the hot closet to dry; they are then ready for use. 

Boston Chips. 

Boil the required quantity of sugar to the crack, flavoring and coloring it as 
desired; turn it onto a greased marble slab, and let it cool. Turn in the edges, and 
with a hook fastened in the wall, pull the mass until it is quite light in appearance. 
Run it through a machine set so close that it will come out as thin as a wafer. Cut 
it into fancy shapes, wind them round an oiled stick, and let them get cold before 
packing away in boxes. 

Candied Fruit or Nuts. 

Boil one-half pound of loaf sugar in one breakfast cupful of water. The syrup 
must not be stirred, and must boil furiously. Take the prepared fruit or nuts on the 
point of a large needle or fine skewer, dip them into the syrup, and then lay them on 
a dish that has been slightly buttered or oiled, or string them on a thread, and after 
dipping them in the syrup, suspend them by the thread. When oranges are used, 
divide them into sections and dry them on a sieve, or in a warm room, or in the open 
air. Cherries should be stoned. Walnuts are particularly nice prepared in this way. 

Candied Quarters of Oranges. 

Peel the oranges, divide them into quarters, remove the pips as carefully as pos- 
sible, and boil the fruit gently in plenty of water. Drain them thoroughly on a sieve, 



812 CONFECTIONERY. 

then place in a stewpan with syrup at twenty-eight degrees, and let them boil slowly 
for ten minutes. Turn them into a basin with the syrup and leave till the following 
day; then drain the syrup from the oranges, boil it and pour over them again. Pro- 
ceed in the same way the three following days, giving the syrup in all what is called 
four fashions. Remove the quarters of oranges carefully from the syrup, put them 
on wire sieves and set them in the screen. When they are dry, dip them in semi- 
grained sugar and dry again. When quite dry (they should not stick to the fingers 
when touched), take the sieve of oranges from the screen and leave them until cold, 
then pack away in boxes between layers of white paper. 



American Candy. 



Pour one pint of water and one-fourth pint of vinegar over six pounds of sugar 
and leave it until fully dissolved. Place a sugar-pan over the fire and let the contents 
boil fast till thick enough to put into ropes. Mix in them one-fourth pound of butter 
and boil hard for two minutes; stir in one teaspoonful of dry soda and remove the 
candy from the fire. Allow it to stand until the effervescence ceases and then stir 
in a flavoring of vanilla. Turn it out onto greased dishes, and with the tips of the 
fingers pull it until it is white. 

Cream Candy. 

Put one tablespoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one teacupful of 
water and two pounds of lump sugar into a saucepan and boil the mixture for twenty 
minutes. Before removing it from the fire add a little extract of vanilla or essence of 
lemon, and pour it into a flat tin dish, stirring it until quite cold. It is then ready 
for use. 

Nut Candy. 

Put three breakfast cupfuls of sugar into a sugar-boiler with one teacupful each 
of vinegar and water and the strained juice of a lemon. Set the boiler on the fire 
and stir until boiled to the crack (see Sugar Boiling). Drop it in small quantities 
on a well-buttered baking-sheet, put half a blanched kernel on each, and when nearly 
cold add more syrup. When the required number are done, dry them on a sieve over 
the fire, and they are ready for use. 

Rock Candy. 

This is really crystallized sugar in its simplest form. Place some clarified sugar 
in a sugar boiler, and boil to the feather, and add a few drops of acetic acid or spirits 
of wine in order to assist the separation of the crystals from the more hardened por- 
tions of the syrup. Pour the syrup into moulds, and let it remain in the hot closet at 
a temperature of from 90 to 100 deg. of heat; leave it there for eight or ten days, 
according to the size of the crystal desired. In the process of crystallizing, the im- 



CONFECTIONERY. 813 

purities contained in the sugar are left behind in the water, and the sugar is rendered 
as nearly pure as possible. When the crystallization is complete, pour off the surplus 
syrup, turn the mould upside down, and let it remain until fully drained. The moulds 
are made of strong tin or copper, and must be considerably smaller at the bottom 
than at the top, and pierced with small holes round the sides in uniform rows, tier 
above tier, and sewn with coarse thread across the mould from side to side, after 
which they must be pasted up with paper, or covered with potter's clay all over the 
outside, in order effectually to close the holes and prevent the syrup from leaking 
out. When quite drained, remove the paper from the sides, warm the mould equally 
round the outside, and strike the edge of it with a sharp, hard knock upon the table, 
when the sugar will relieve itself from the mould. Place the mould upon a sieve or 
board, and set it in the hot closet until it is perfectly dry. This candy may be tinted 
a rose or scarlet color by adding a little prepared carmine or cochineal before boiling. 
The purer the sugar used for making the syrup the whiter the candy will be. 

Peanut Candy. 

Dissolve two pounds of sugar and one saltspoonful of cream of tartar in two gills 
of cold water; then set it over a moderate fire and cook till brittle, adding and stirring 
in about one-half ounce of butter. Shell some peanuts, and rub off as much of the 
inner skin as possible. Put a layer of them two deep at the bottom of some well- 
buttered tins, and when the candy is ready, pour it over and leave till cold. Then cut 
it or break it into pieces of a convenient size. 

Vanilla Candy Tablets. 

Put one pound of loaf sugar into a sugar-boiler with just enough water to dis- 
solve it. Boil the sugar to the ball degree, then pour in a few drops of acetic acid and 
flavor with essence of vanilla. Work the sugar against the sides of the pan with a 
silver spoon, using the back part of the bowl, thus giving it an opalized appearance. 
When through working the sugar, pour it into a tin dish, leaving it until it is nearly set, 
then mark the tablets out with the back of a knife on the surface of the sugar. Be- 
fore the sugar is poured in, the tin should be lightly brushed over with the oil of 
almonds. Dry the sugar in the screen, and when it is hard, snap it in two where it 
is marked. 

Walnut Candy. 

Crack the walnuts and shell them carefully. Pound or chop one and one-half 
pints of the kernels. Mix three-fourths of a teacupful of vinegar and one and one- 
half teaspoonfuls of gelatine dissolved in a little hot water with one and one-half 
pounds of brown sugar, place it over a moderate fire and cook until quite stiff. Pour 
a thin layer of this syrup into buttered-tins, then add the pounded or chopped wal- 



814 CONFECTIONERY. 

nuts, spreading them evenly, pour over the remainder of the syrup and let the candy 
stand until cold; then cut it into squares. 

Caramels. 

(1) Boil some syrup and flavor with either liquors, essences, or some strong 
extract of coffee; then hold it over a very slow fire in a saucepan in order to allow it 
to cook slowly for about two or three minutes; in this way it will acquire flavor, but 
little or no additional color. Oil a slab, pour the caramels on it, and when it has 
cooled a little, mark it with the back of a knife in the shape of a small square or 
lozenge. When quite cool, break in pieces. 

(2) Take one-fourth pound of chocolate broken up, two pounds of brown 
sugar, one-fourth of a pound of fresh butter and one-half pint of milk. Pour the 
milk into a preserving-pan and add the other ingredients to this. Allow it to boil 
for at least half an hour, stirring frequently. When it is done, a crust of sugar will 
form on the spoon and on the side of the pan. Pour in a tablespoonful of extract of 
vanilla or other flavoring; remove from the fire and stir rapidly until the caramel be- 
gins to thicken. Then pour it quickly into buttered-pans, and when nearly cold, cut 
into small squares. 

Orange Caramels. 

Peel the oranges carefully, removing all the white part of the rind; separate them 
into sections without breaking the skin and lay them in confectioners' sugar for a 
short time. Make a syrup of loaf sugar and very little water, boil it till a very little of 
it tried in water is brittle, then dip the pieces of orange separately and quickly into it 
and lay them on a well-oiled tray to dry. They should be very carefully removed 
from the trays when dry, as the caramel is easily broken. 

Philadelphia Caramels. 

Put three and one-half pounds of sugar into a sugar-boiler with one-fourth of a 
pound of butter, one-fourth teaspoonful of cream of tartar, a quarter of a pound of 
cocoa paste, and one ounce of white wax of paraffin; pour in one pint of rich cream, 
and boil over a clear fire to the crack. Have ready a well-greased marble slab with 
iron bars on it, pour over the mixture, and let it get cold. Cut it into cubes or other 
shapes, wrap them up separately in wax paper, and lay them away in boxes. 

Raspberry Caramels. 

Put six pounds of sugar and one-half gallon of cream into a sugar-boiler, stir 
well, and add four pounds of glucose, boil for about fifteen minutes, stirring all the 
time. Add one and one-half pounds of butter, and boil it to the crack. Add two 



CONFECTIONERY. 815 

tablespoonfuls of raspberry extract, stir well, turn the mixture out onto a well-oiled 
plate, and allow it to cool. Mark it in the desired shapes, break it when cold, put 
the pieces away into bottles or boxes, and let them remain in a dry place until 
required for use. 

Vanilla Caramels. 

Mix well together two pounds of the best white sugar, one ounce of gelatine dis- 
solved in two-thirds a breakfast cupful of cold water, one-half ounce of pure paraffin 
wax, one-half pint of cream, and one pound of glucose (though, if the caramels are 
made in the summer time, the glucose may be reduced to eleven ounces). Put this 
mixture over the fire, and stir it constantly until, when a little is dried in cold 
water, it forms a ball if rolled through the fingers, then stir in a flavoring of vanilla, 
remove it from the fire, pour into well-buttered tins, let cool, and cut it into three- 
fourth inch squares. Wrap them separately in oiled paper, and keep them in a cool 
place until wanted. 

Chestnut Glace with Caramel. 

Select one quart of chestnuts, slit the skins with a knife, place them in a frying- 
pan on a slow fire, and roast them, but do not allow them to get brown, then remove 
the skins. When they are quite cold, stick a wooden peg or splint into each chest- 
nut. Boil one pound of loaf sugar in a pint of water, and dip each chestnut into it. 
Try the sugar by dipping a skewer first into the sugar and then in cold water; if it 
comes off easily, it will not stick to the teeth. In a broad flat basin, put some brown 
sugar, and push the ends of the skewers into it, leaving the chestnuts uppermost to 
drain, and when they are cold, arrange them tastefully on a compote-dish. 

Chestnut Glaces with Sugar. 

Into a stewpan partly filled with water put one-half pound of crushed loaf-sugar, 
not having more water than the sugar will absorb, and boil it to the crack. Then boil 
the requisite quantity of chestnuts until soft, and peel them, taking care not to break 
them. Take them on the point of an iron skewer, one at a time; dip them first into 
the syrup and then, quickly, into cold water. As the chestnuts are done, slip them, 
off the skewer onto a wire sieve, and dry them in a warm place. 



Acid Drops. 



Put three pounds of loaf sugar in a sugar-boiler with one teaspoonful of cream of 
tartar, and two breakfast cupfuls of water, and boil them to the crack. When the pan is 
removed from the fire, stir in a few drops of essence of lemon, pour the sugar onto an 
oiled marble slab, sprinkle over one tablespoonful of powdered tartaric acid and work 
it in. Place it on an oiled tin sheet to keep warm ; take a small quantity at a time, 



816 CONFECTIONERY. 

roll it out to the shape of a pipe-stem, cut it into small pieces with a pair of scissors, 
roll them round in the hands, or the paste may be passed through a drop-machine; 
dust over with fine sugar, and put them away in boxes. 



Cough Drops. 



Prepare a decoction of two ounces of dried horehound, half that quantity of 
camomile, the same of boneset, and two ounces of mullein-flowers, by placing them 
all in a saucepan, covering them all with water, and boiling them for ten or twelve 
minutes. Turn the whole into an earthenware or porcelain bowl, cover closely, 
and let them remain until cold. Strain and pass the liquor through a hair-sieve, 
measure it, and to each pint allow two pounds of sugar Put the sugar and liquor 
into a saucepan, boil them to the crack degree, let it cool, pour it onto a greased 
marble slab, turn it at the edges, and cut it into tablets, or pass it through a drop- 
machine. Dust them over with fine sugar, put them in boxes, and keep in a cool 
place. 



Millefleur Drops. 



For all sugar drops the sugar should first be sifted through a fine sieve, and then 
through a very fine one to sift out all the powder that is not required in making them. 
Put the necessary quantity of sugar into a basin, and mix in by degrees with a spoon 
sufficient water to make a paste of such a consistency that it will easily drop from the 
spoon and leave none sticking on it. Pour the paste into a bright sugar-pan, place it 
on the stove and stir it with a spatula until the sugar is dissolved and on the point of 
boiling. Then remove it at once, and stir in a sufficient quantity of essence of mille- 
fleur to flavor it, and with a wire in the right hand, and the pan in the other, drop off 
small pieces, cutting them with the wire and allowing them to fall on thick cartridge 
paper, a marble slab, or a tin or copper plate. This is the old-fashioned and homely 
style of making drops. Place the drops away to cool for about two hours, and 
remove them from the paper or plate by draining the former, and by using a thin 
spatula for the latter; pack them away in bottles or boxes, and keep them in a cool 
dry place until they are wanted. 



Strawberry Drops. 



Pass a quantity of ripe strawberries through a fine hair sieve, and mix with them 
some coarsely sifted sugar. Put the paste into a sugar-boiler with a lip to it, and stir 
it over the fire until boiling; then let the drops fall slowly from the lip of the pan on 
to a baking-sheet, leaving a small space between each. When cold, place the drops 
onto a sieve, and dry them in a hot closet. Keep them packed in canisters. 



CONFECTIONERY. 817 

Vanilla Drops. 

Cut up as fine as possible two vanilla beans; place them in a mortar with a 
little sugar and pound them to a powder. Sift this through a fine sieve, and mix 
with it one pound of coarsely sifted sugar. Put this in a basin and add gradually, 
stirring with a spoon, sufficient water to make the paste of such a thickness that it 
will fall from a spoon and none of it remain sticking to it. Turn the paste into a 
liquid sugar-pan, place it on the stove, and stir well with a spatula until the sugar is 
dissolved and makes a slight noise. When on the point of boiling, remove the pan 
and work well with a spatula until when dropped the paste will retain its former 
shape and not spread too much. With the pan in the left hand and a piece of wire 
in the right, let the drops fall on a smooth tin or cartridge paper; harden then in a 
hot closet for two or three hours, remove from the tin or paper and pack them away 
for use. Vanilla beans are used in preference to the essence, as the latter is apt to 
make the paste greasy. 

English Rock. 

Put seven pounds of moist sugar and one quart of water into a sugar-boiler, boil 
it to the crack, turn it out onto an oiled slab, and spread over and work in thoroughly 
four pounds of sweet almonds, not blanched, form the mass into a roll, and let it get 
cool. Cut it into slices about one-half inch in thickness, and when perfectly cold it 
should be packed away in tins. 

Vanilla Lozenges. 

Cut up four or five vanilla beans, place them in a mortar with a small quantity 
of sugar, and pound them to a powder; sift it through a fine sieve, and mix up with 
two pounds more of sifted sugar on a slab. Form a hollow in the center, and pour 
in sufficient dissolved gum or about one-half pound of gum Arabic dissolved in one 
breakfast cupful of water to make a stiff paste, and roll it out to about one-eighth 
of an inch in thickness. Sprinkle the surface with starch powder, and fine sugar, 
smooth it with the palm of the hand, cut it up into lozenges, place them on wooden 
trays on the stove, and allow them to dry. Pack them away in tin boxes for use. 

Strawberry Marzipan. 

Blanch one pound of sweet almonds, and boil one and one-fourth pounds of 
.powdered sugar to the ball (see Sugar Boiling), put the blanched almonds into a 
mortar, and pound them to a fine paste, mixing them with the sugar. Crush in a 
muslin bag one-half pound of picked strawberries, squeeze out the juice, and add to 
it the paste of the almonds and syrup; mix it thoroughly together, put the mixture in 
a pan, and place hot ashes under it. Continue stirring until the mixture is sufficiently 



8i8 CONFECTIONERY. 

done, that is when a small piece laid on the back of the hand may be taken off again 
without sticking. Spread it on a slab, and when perfectly cold cut it into any de- 
sired shapes. 

Nougat. 

This is described as a cake, confection or sweetmeat made of almonds or other 
nuts. When freshly prepared it is so elastic that it can be moulded into cups, baskets 
or any other shapes. The following recipes give a variety of favorite modes of pre- 
paring and using nougat: 

1 I ) Put eight ounces of fine powdered sugar into a copper egg-whipping bowl 
and mix in the whites of three eggs, whipping continually over a clear fire until the 
paste is of the consistency of thick batter. Add one-half pound of almonds blanched 
and cut into small pieces, two ounces of chopped candied orange peel, one table- 
spoonful of vanilla sugar and a few drops of prepared cochineal. Mix thoroughly 
and spread it out upon two pieces of wafer-paper to about one inch in thickness, 
cover with two more pieces of paper, using a flat plate or board with a small weight 
on top to keep them level. Put them in an oven of very moderate heat and bake 
for a few minutes. Take them out, and when nearly dry cut them up into narrow, 
oblong squares. They are then ready for use. 

(2) Put one-half pound of powdered sugar into a copper egg-bowl, add the 
whites of two eggs and one tablespoonful of orange-flower water. Set the pan over 
a slow fire and whisk well until the mixture is of the consistency of stiff batter. Mix 
in one-half pound of almonds, blanched and shred very fine, stir well and put the 
paste on sheets of wafer-paper spread over a baking-sheet in the form of small ovals. 
Put them in a very moderate oven and dry slowly. They will be ready for use when 
firm. Take care to keep them as white as possible. 

(3) Put a little orange-flower water into a saucepan with fourteen ounces of 
honey and boil to the ball degree (see Sugar Boiling). Meanwhile whisk the whites 
of two eggs to a stiff froth, add two pounds of blanched and finely-chopped sweet 
almonds and one-fourth pound of confectioner's sugar and beat them together with 
the honey into a smooth paste. Put a sheet of wafer-paper on a board, spread the 
paste over about one-half inch thick, cover with another sheet of paper and put 
another board on top with a weight on it. When quite cold cut into shapes, and it 
is ready for use. 

(4) Blanch five ounces of sweet almonds and cut them into fine threads. 
Roast the kernels of three ounces of Brazilian nuts and peel them, chop the nuts 
and one and one-half ounces of candied lemon peel, mix them together with the 
almonds and three-fourths of a pound of confectioner's sugar. Whip the whites 
of two eggs to a stiff froth, stir them into the other ingredients and work all to 
a paste. Spread the nougat on a sheet of wafer-paper, cover with another sheet 



CONFECTIONERY. 819 

of the same paper and press well between two sheets of iron or tin, and put the 
paste in the oven for thirty minutes. Leave the nougat till cold before cutting 
it up. 

(5) Blanch four pounds of almonds and put them in a cool oven where they 
will dry and keep slightly warm. Put two pounds of confectioner's sugar into a 
copper pan, add one pound of white honey, put the pan on the fire, skimming 
frequently, and as soon as it begins to boil add four tablespoonfuls of syrup and 
a few drops of citric acid. When the sugar is at the crack degree (see Sugar 
Boiling), remove the pan to the side of the fire, add a few drops of extract of 
roses or orange-flower water and a very little vegetable carmine, turn the whole 
out onto a well-oiled marble slab and with a flat spoon scrape it all into the 
center until it forms a mass that can be easily worked. Take it up in the hands 
and work it on a hook in the same way as for twisted sugar (see Sugar), but 
without allowing it to get cold, and working in the almonds and two handfuls of 
pistachio kernels. Have ready a low, square-shaped wooden case spread with 
large slips of wafer-paper, put the mixture in, smoothing it over on top so as to 
give it an even thickness of about two inches and cover over with more wafer- 
paper. Put the lid on the case with a heavy weight on top so as to push the 
nougat close down, let it remain for about ten minutes, turn it out of the case, 
divide it into long squares, cutting it in pieces with the aid of a crescent-shaped 
cleaving-knife. 



Nougat Baskets. 



Blanch one and one-half pounds of almonds, cut them into shavings, and place 
them near the fire to be thoroughly dried and warmed through. Put three-fourths of a 
pound of the best confectioner's sugar over a moderate fire with just enough water to 
keep it from burning, keep stirring it till the sugar begins to bubble, then stir in the 
almonds, mixing them well with the sugar. Have ready some well-oiled shallow 
moulds, line them with the nougat, trim the edges nicely with a good-sized pair of 
scissors, notch the edges, and when the nougat is quite cold, take them out of the 
shapes and fill up with whipped cream, laying a strawberry on top. Small handles 
made of candy may be put across each. 

(2). Blanch one and one-fourth pounds of sweet almonds, cut them into long 
strips, and dry thoroughly in a warm oven for five or six hours. Take half the weight 
of the almonds (when they are dry) of sugar, put it into a sugar pan, add the juice of 
two lemons, and stir it well over the fire until the sugar is all dissolved. Boil quickly 
for a few minutes but without letting it take color. Remove the pan to the side of 
the fire and add the almonds. Have ready a basket mould in three parts, oil well and 
spread the mixture quickly over, thinly but evenly, seeing that it is quite cool before 
taking it off the mould. Spread a charlotte mould over with the remainder of the 
paste, and fix it firmly upside down on a dish. Fix the bottom part of the basket on 



820 CONFECTIONERY. 

the charlotte mould, and adorn the upper edge of the basket, first with a border of 
puff paste, baked lightly, and then with a circle of preserved green gages glazed with 
sugar, fixing two rings of gum paste for handles. Surround the base of the mould 
with a circle of small cakes, fill the hollow of the basket with vanilla ice-cream and it 
is ready for use. This makes a handsome table ornament, but requires great experi- 
ence to prepare. 

Honey Nougat. 

Place a pound and a half each of sugar and strained honey in a saucepan over a 
very gentle fire, and stir it until quite brittle, which can be found out by putting a 
little cold water in the sugar. Add the beaten whites of three eggs and stir them in. 
If the mixture is not sticky stir in a little flavoring of orange essence, and then mix 
in a pound and a half of sweet almonds, blanched and dried; blend it all well together 
and spread it two inches thick on oiled papers; lay it between two boards, put a 
heavy weight on top and leave until quite cold. Then cut in strips. 



Nougat with Apricots. 



Roll out one-half pound of puff paste to one-sixteenth inch in thickness and 
bake. When quite cold spread over apricot jam to about an inch in thickness. 
Meanwhile put one-half pound of well-chopped and dried sweet almonds into a basin 
with eight ounces of powdered sugar and the whites of three eggs beaten to a snow, 
mix them thoroughly and spread the mixture over the jam. Put the sheet of paste, 
etc., into a moderate oven and let it remain until firm and slightly browned. Take it 
out, and when quite cold cut it into pieces or squares; put them on a napkin spread 
over a dish, and serve. 

Pistachio Paste. 

Blanch, drain and put into a mortar one pound of pistachios, pound them to a 
pulp, adding a little orange-flower water to prevent oiling, after which rub them 
through a fine hair sieve onto a plate. Put one ounce of gum tragacanth previously 
well soaked and squeeze through a cloth on a marble slab and work it with the hand 
until it is of a white and elastic appearance, when it may be mixed in with the 
pistachio pulp and half a pound of finely-sifted icing sugar, beating thoroughly all 
the while and adding more of the sugar until the paste becomes quite firm, compact, 
and elastic. 

Brazil-Nuts Pralines. 

Put one pound of shelled Brazil-nuts into a pan over the fire with a little water 
and one pound of loaf sugar and let them boil until they begin to sparkle, then re- 
move the pan from the fire and with a wooden spoon stir the nuts well until the sugar 
begins to feel gritty; put them over a slow fire in order to dissolve the sugar again 



CONFECTIONERY. 821 

and keep on stirring that the nuts may get well covered with sugar, and when they 
turn reddish and are sufficiently well covered with sugar take from the fire, pour them 
onto a sieve, cover the sieve with a clean cloth and place it in the oven; this will dry 
the sugar on the nuts and cause them to look glossy. 

Colored Sugars. 

Rub the required quantity of powdered sugar through a fine sieve onto a piece 
of paper, turn it into a round-bottomed pan, place it on the stove to warm, stir it well 
until the sugar is nearly dry, turn it out, and it is ready for use. 

Flavored Sugar. 

Rub the required quantity of powdered sugar through a fine sieve on a sheet of 
paper, turn it into a round-bottomed pan, set it on the stove to warm, and whisk in 
any kind of flavoring essence desired. 

Sugared Flowers. 

Boil some sugar to the crack degree. If, when a fork is dipped into the pan, it 
throws off the sugar as fine as threads when taken out, it is ready, and the flowers 
may be put in. Rub the inside of some teacups with salad-oil, and put into each cup 
four tablespoonfuls of the flowers and sugar; let them stand until cold, turn them out, 
and serve piled one on top of the other. 



Preserves, Jams, Etc. 

Almond Milk. 

When almonds, either bitter or sweet, are pounded together, and water added, 
the liquor resulting is of a milky appearance, and is commonly known as "almond 
milk." Mix four ounces of almonds to every pint of water, straining over half a 
pound of fine sugar, boil up once, and put in bottles for future use. This prepara- 
tion will keep good for a week. 

Bottled Red Currants. 

Pick from the stalks some currants barely ripe, and of the red variety; pack 
them very closely into bottles, fill up the bottles with twenty-two degree syrup. 
Place them in a pan with hot water, and let their contents boil for ten minutes. Then 
take the bottles out of the water, cork them, and when cold they are ready for storing. 

Bottled Fruits. 

For every pound of fruit allow six ounces of coarsely crushed loaf sugar and half 
a teacupful of water. Prepare the fruit by removing the stalks, etc., put it into a pan 
with the sugar and water, and boil it over a slow fire for ten minutes. Warm some 
wide-mouthed glass bottles near the fire, then dip a thin stick in sulphur, light it, and 
hold a bottle mouth downwards over it, The bottle will become full of smoke, and 
by this means all the air in it will be exhausted. Fill the bottles at once with the 
fruit, smoking each bottle first and then filling it. Cork the bottle air-tight and place 
in a dry cupboard. 

Bottled Greengages. 

Select greengages that are not too ripe, make small holes all over them, put them 
in wide-mouthed bottles, fill the bottles with thin syrup, cork and tie down; place 
them in a saucepan of water, bring it gently to the boil, and simmer until the fruit 
turns brown. Remove from the fire, leave the bottles in the water for a day, boil 
again for ten minutes, and the fruit is ready for use. 



Bottled Pineapple. 



Peel the rind smoothly and carefully off some pineapples, pick out all the discol- 
ored parts, and cut off the heads and stalks. Cut the pines in slices, and pack 

822 



PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 823 

them closely in wide-mouthed bottles or glass jars; fill each one with syrup boiled to 
the twenty-six degree; cork them, and tie down. Put the bottles in a saucepan of water, 
placing straw round them to prevent their knocking together and breaking, and boil 
them for twenty-five minutes. Then remove from the fire, and leave the bottles in 
the water until cold, dip the ends in bottle-wax, and store them away for use. 

Bottled Plums. 

Select the required quantity of plums, prick them all over and drop them into a 
preserving-pan with some syrup of thirty-two degrees just removed from the fire; when 
the plums are all in, put the pan on a hot screen or over a charcoal fire, until the 
syrup has become quite hot, then take out the plums carefully, put them in a basin, 
and let them remain there for twenty-four hours or so; then put them into wide- 
mouthed bottles and boil up the syrup again, skim it thoroughly and when it- has be- 
come nearly cold, pour it into the bottles over the plums; cork the bottles, tie down 
well, and place them in a saucepan with water to the beginning of the necks of the 
bottles, boil for quarter of an hour, and when cold, they are ready for use. 

Bottled Raspberries. 

Remove the stems and unsound berries from the fruit, put the fruit into bottles, 
and pour over sufficient syrup at twenty-six degrees to fill them, place the bottles in a 
large saucepan with water to half their height, and simmer gently for five minutes. 
Allow the bottles to cool, pour off all the syrup into a sugar-boiler, and turn the fruit 
from one bottle into that of another, so as to have two lots in one bottle. Add to 
the syrup one-fourth of its bulk in raspberry juice, boil up once, skim it well, pour it 
into the bottles over the fruit, cork them down when cold, and the raspberries are 
then ready for use. 

Bottled Strawberries. 

Remove the stalks from some freshly-gathered ripe strawberries, put them in 
wide-mouthed glass bottles, and fill them up with syrup that has been boiled to twenty- 
six degrees (see Sugar Boiling) ; put the bottles, without corking them, into a large 
saucepan, put in cold water to half their height, and stand the saucepan over the fire. 
When boiling, move the saucepan, with the bottles, from the fire, and leave them to 
cool a little. Strain the syrup off the strawberries into a preserving-pan, and one- 
fourth of the quantity of strained red currant juice, boil it up and skim it. Fill up the 
bottles with the fruit by emptying one bottle into another, then fill them up with 
syrup. Cork the bottles, tie them down, and keep in a dry store cupboard. 

Brandied Fruits. 

Take equal quantities of ripe and sound fruit, such as apricots, peaches and 
plums, and prick them several times with a fork through to the stones. Put loaf 



824 PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 

sugar in a lined vessel, allowing one pound of sugar to one pound of fruit, pour in a 
small quantity of water, just about as much as the sugar will absorb, and place it 
over the fire until small transparent bubbles rise to the top. Put the mixed fruits into 
the syrup, and simmer gently at the side of the fire until just beginning to soften, then 
take it off, as the fruits must still remain firm. Leave them in the syrup until cold, 
or until the following day, then take them out, and place on a wire-sieve to drain. 
Boil the syrup until somewhat thickly reduced, and, when it is cold, mix with it an 
equal quantity of pale brandy. Place the fruit in jars or glasses, and pour the syrup 
over them. 

Apple Brandy. 

Apple brandy is a spirit made wholesale in the United States from apples, and is 
more familiarly known as Apple Jack. To five barrels of good rectified spirit, add 
one gallon of syrup of gum-arabic, one pound of oil of apple and half a pound of oil 
of pear. Let it remain for some time in the barrel, then stir well, and filter. 

Apricot Brandy. 

Mix half a pound of sugar and a little water with every two dozen apricots 
used; boil up and then remove and place in jars, and when cold, fill them up with 
brandy. Cover over securely and allow them to remain for several days, when they 
are ready for use. They may be carefully and thinly peeled before putting into the 
syrup, although this is not generally done. 

Brandy Peaches. 

Split some large peaches in halves, put them in a lined-pan with some syrup and 
boil for two or three minutes; then take them out, peel the skins off, put them back 
again in the same syrup and let them simmer for five minutes; then take the pan off 
the fire and leave peaches in it till the next day. Drain the peaches and arrange 
them carefully in jars. Boil their syrup to the feather degree (see Sugar Boiling), 
then mix with it an equal quantity of white brandy, and when nearly cold, pour it 
over the peaches. When the syrup is quite cold, cork the jars and tie bladders over 
the tops. Keep them in a cool place. 

Plums in Brandy. 

Use eight pounds of half ripe plums, prick them all over and place over the 
fire in cold water as soon as the water boils and the fruit rises to the surface, take out 
with a skimmer and lay them in a pan of cold water. Then clarify two pounds of 
loaf sugar, boil it to the little thread, put in the plums and boil, then remove them 
from the pan and let them stand in their syrup over night. The next day take them 
out of the syrup, boil this once and put the plums in again and boil once more, then 



PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 825 

let them stand all night. Repeat this operation the next day and the following day, 
drain the plums and put them into bottles, boil the syrup to candy height, let it cool, 
and when quite cold, add to it three-fourths of its own quantity of the best brandy, 
mix thoroughly with the syrup, strain it and pour it over the plums. Cork the bot- 
tles thoroughly. 

Prunes in Brandy. 

Pack the plums in layers in a wide-mouthed bottle strewing a liberal quantity 
of powdered sugar over each layer; fill it up with the best brandy, cork, and stand 
the bottle in the corner on a warm stove. After a few hours time, remove the bottle, 
and after letting it stand for a short time, the plums are ready for use, although they 
are somewhat improved by longer keeping. 

Raspberry Brandy. 

Blanch about twenty bitter almonds, and cut them into small pieces. Pick care- 
fully over two pounds of ripe raspberries to remove all the stems and leaves, and place 
them in a quart bottle with the almonds and one pound of crushed sugar. Fill the 
bottle up with brandy and cork it tightly, and keep it in a warm place for a month. 
Shake the bottle occasionally, If possible the bottle should be exposed to the sun. 
At the end of that time it may be removed to a dry store-cupboard. The brandy 
ought to be kept ten or twelve months before it is used. 

Candied Nectarines. 

Cut the nectarines to extract the stones, put the fruit in a pan with half their 
weight of crushed loaf sugar and one gill of water to each pound of sugar; boil over 
a good fire until the syrup is clear, carefully removing the scum as it rises. Skim 
out the nectarines, put them on flat dishes, cover, and let them remain for a day. 
Put the pan with the sugar over the fire and boil until it is thick, then add the fruit 
and boil slowly until quite hot. Take them out again, put them on a dish and let 
them remain for one day longer. Boil the syrup again, add the fruit, and let it re- 
main for a short time. Place them on a sieve to dry, sprinkle them over with 
powdered sugar turning frequently until dry and candied when they will be fit for 
use. Candied nectarines will keep for some time. 

Candied or Crystallized Nuts. 

Put one breakfast cupful of sugar and same of water into a sugar boiler, and boil 
to the crack degree (see Sugar Boiling). Put the boiler into a saucepan of boiling 
water to keep the syrup hot, and dip in the required quantity of blanched nuts, stick- 
ing them on the point of a needle, or thin skewer to do so; then put them on a 
slightly buttered dish and let them cool. If not sufficiently coated with the syrup, 
dip them again. When dry they are ready to serve. 



826 PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 

Candied Pears. 

Peel and core some pears and let them simmer in syrup, with a little lemon juice 
in it, for ten minutes; turn the pears out, pour the syrup over them, cover the basin 
and leave them till next day. Strain the syrup off the pears, boil it and pour over 
them again. Repeat this operation the two following days, giving in all four boilings. 
Drain the pears on a cane sieve, then, when quite free from moisture, put them a little 
apart from each other on wire trays, rest them on dishes and put them in a screen at 
a slow heat to dry them. Take the pears off the trays when cold and dry and pack 
them in boxes lined with white paper 

Candied Plums. 

Stone and cut in halves some good plums of a nice shape, lay them in a shallow 
dish, dredge plenty of powdered sugar over and put in a moderate oven, keeping the 
door closed for half an hour; then remove and lay the plums separately on glass 
plates to dry. 

Strawberry Conserve. 

Take some fresh and very ripe strawberries, pick them over, crush them in a 
cloth and wring out the juice. To each dessertspoonful of juice allow six ounces of 
sugar. Boil the sugar to the pearl degree (see Sugar Boiling), then remove it from 
the fire and pour the juice into it, and, if necessary, a little carmine. Stir it with a 
wooden spoon until the conserve begins to get dry and white, then put it into moulds 
or paper cases. 

Dried Grape Fruit. 

Cut the fruit into seven or eight pieces lengthwise, pick out the pips, place the 
fruit in a saucepan with plenty of water and boil until it becomes soft. Put the 
pieces on a sieve and drain them well; then put them into a pan with some syrup at 
twenty-eight degrees and let them simmer for ten minutes. Turn the fruit with the 
syrup into a basin and leave them. On the following day strain the syrup off the 
fruit, boil it up again and pour it over the fruit. Repeat the same operation on the 
three following days. On the fourth day arrange the pieces of fruit on a wire tray 
and place them in the screen to dry. Dip the pieces of fruit into grained sugar, ar- 
range them a short distance from each other on the tray, and put them again in the 
screen. When thoroughly dry lift the fruit from the screen by pushing the fingers 
through underneath, for by doing it in this way it is not so likely to break the sugar. 
Pack the fruit for preserving between layers of cardboard in paper boxes. 

Dried Greengages. 

Select some perfectly sound greengages, cut off the brown end of the stalks but 
leave the remainder on; prick them all over with a pin, then put them in a pan with suf- 



PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 827 

ficient syrup of twenty-two degrees for them to float; set them over a smothered fire and 
leave for ten minutes. Turn the greengages and syrup into a large jar and cover 
them with vine leaves. On the following day strain off the syrup, boil up again, 
skim it and pour it back on the greengages. Repeat the operation of boiling for the 
two following days. Take the greengages out of the syrup and lay them a short 
distance from each other on a wire drainer placed on a baking-sheet; put them in a 
screen and dry them slowly. Boil a pound and a half of sugar to the pearl degree, 
squeeze in the juice of a lemon and work it against the sides of the pan with the bowl 
of a spoon until it has a dull white appearance, then throw in the dried greengages. 
Toss them about to give them a good coating, then lift them carefully out with a 
fork and place on the drainer, the stalk side upward. Dry the greengages slowly in 
a screen, then pack them away in boxes between layers of paper 

Dried Peaches. 

Cut some peaches into halves and put them in a preserving-pan with some syrup 
at twenty-two degrees; let them simmer for a few minutes till the skins can be easily re- 
moved; take them out, peel, and put them back in the syrup; boil for a few minutes, 
then turn all into a basin and let it remain till the following day. Drain the syrup 
off the peaches, boil it up again, then pour it over them. Repeat this for the two 
following days. Put the peaches on drainers, dip a camel's hair-brush in prepared 
cochineal or carmine, paint the peaches lightly over and set them in the screen to 
dry. Boil one and one-half pounds of sugar to the pearl degree (see Sugar Boiling), 
drain the juice of a lemon in with it and work the sugar at the side of the pan with a 
spoon until it becomes whitish, then put in the peaches and shake them gently about. 
Take each piece out with a fork, arrange them on a brass drainer and set them in the 
screen at a moderate heat to dry. In about an .hour's time, pack the peaches in card- 
board boxes with a sheet of white paper between each layer. 

Dried Pineapple. 

Peel and cut out any discolored parts of a pineapple, cut them in slices one- 
fourth inch thick, put them in a preserving-pan with some syrup at twenty-two degrees 
and let simmer for ten minutes. Put the pineapple and syrup in a white-lined pan and 
leave them till the following day. Strain the syrup off, boil it and pour it over the 
pineapple again. Proceed in the same way the two following days. On the fourth 
day take the slices from the syrup, drain them well and put them apart from each 
other on wire trays. Stand the trays in dishes to catch the dripping and array these 
in the screen. When dry, remove, and when cold, pack in boxes between sheets of 
white paper. 

Ginger Sugar. 

Put in a mortar one pound of powdered sugar, with two ounces of ground ginger, 
mix well, pass it through a sieve, bottle, cork down tightly, and it is ready for use. 



828 PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 



Apple Ginger. 



Take an equal quantity of apples and sugar, adding some water to make a syrup. 
Chop the apples very fine with a little green ginger, or if the green ginger is not 
available, use the dry. Put this mince into the syrup, and the grated rind of a few 
lemons, and boil slowly for two hours, or until it has a clear appearance. 



Grapes Glazed with Sugar. 



Boil some syrup as for candying; add half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 
Divide a few bunches of grapes into clusters, dip them into the candy, and lay them 
until dry on dishes slightly greased. 



American Crab-Apple Jam. 



After removing all stalks and unsound parts from the fruit, wipe them well, and 
spread out before the fire to make sure that the peels are thoroughly dried. Then 
weigh the fruit and put it into a preserving-pan, together with an equal quantity of 
preserving-sugar, and enough white wine to moisten. Allow this to boil well, skim 
well, and while it is boiling, put in a few pieces of lemon peel, chopped, or a small 
quantity of cloves, and continue boiling until the fruit begins to break, then place it 
in large glass jars. Tie down when cold. 



Apple Jam. 



Take some good apples; pare and core them, cutting into small pieces, and put 
in a preserving-pan with enough water to coveff them. Boil until they are reduced to 
a pulp, then pass through a hair-sieve. Use one pound of pulp to every twelve 
ounces of preserving-sugar, and boil and skim until no more scum arises, and place 
in pots. When cold, cover with paper and seal with brandy-soaked paper cut to fit 
the inside of the pots. Tie over with paper in the usual way. 



Cherry Jam. 



Select for this fairly ripe fruit. Make a small hole in each and remove the stone, 
breaking the cherry as little as possible. Add three-quarters of a pound of preserv- 
ing sugar to every pound of fruit. Put them into a preserving pan, place it on a good 
fire and boil, stirring it constantly from the start. Allow it to boil for three-quarters 
of an hour, then take out a little and place it on a cold plate to test. If it jellies or 
sets, the jam is done and must be put into jars at once. Remove the jars to a cool 
place and tie them down. It will not be necessary to skim the jam while it is boil- 
ing, as all the scum will boil away. 



PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 829 

Cherry Jam Made Without Sugar. 

Remove the stems from a sufficient quantity of cherries, Wipe them with a cloth 
to free them from all dust, and remove the stones. Break the stones, put them into 
a saucepan with a small quantity of water, and boil for a few minutes. Strain the 
liquor from the stones through a fine hair-sieve, put it back into the saucepan with 
the fruit and boil the whole until it is reduced to a thick jam, stirring at the same 
time with a wooden spoon; a little cinnamon and powdered cloves may be added to 
the jam if the flavor is liked. When sufficiently reduced that is, when the jam is 
boiled to a thick pulp place it in the jars. Leave it until cold and then cover with 
a thin round of paper dipped in brandy and then with a larger round tied firmly round 
the pots. This jam will keep for several months. 

Cranberry Jam. 

Take a quantity of berries, wash them thoroughly and allow their weight in 
sugar. Put the sugar with water about one-half pint of water to each one pound of 
berries into a preserving-pan, set it on the fire and boil for ten minutes, stirring con- 
stantly and skimming off the froth all the time. Add the berries and finish boiling 
until they are quite soft and of a good color. When done warm some glasses or 
jars, put in the preserves and tie down with some pieces of paper steeped in brandy 
laid on the top of each. The jars should be opened only when wanted and be re-cov- 
ered if all is not required at once, as exposure to the air spoils the jam. 



Currant Jam. 

Put one pound each of black, red and white currants into a preserving-pan and 
boil for a few minutes; then add two pounds and a quarter of sugar and boil all 
together, crushing the fruit with a wooden spoon; after boiling gently for half an 
hour, fill the jars with the jam, cover over and put away for use. 

Black Currant Jam. 

Remove the currants from the stalks, taking care that they are quite clean and 
fully ripe. The currants should be gathered in dry weather. Put them in a preserv- 
ing-pot with powdered white sugar in the proportion of one pound of sugar to a pound 
of currants. Set the pan over the fire and boil, stirring occasionally to prevent burn- 
ing ; cook for half an hour and remove the scum as it rises, then take the pan from 
the fire and when the jam has cooled a little, put it into pots. When quite cold 
lay over the pots pieces of white paper soaked in brandy, and cover so as to keep 
them air-tight. 



830 PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 

Red Currant Jam. 

Pick from the stalks some ripe red currants, weigh them, and to every pound of 
currants allow one pound of sugar ; place the mixture on the stove, not over too hot a 
fire, stirring occasionally until it boils, and removing the scum as fast as it arises. Let 
the jam cool a little, put into jars, and cover when quite cool. 

Red and White Currant Jam. 

Select fruit that has been carefully picked, remove the stalks, weigh, and put into 
a preserving-pan with an equal weight of preserving-sugar, and boil for nine minutes. 
Pour the jam into jars and cover with paper soaked in brandy, and then with a 
bladder or prepared paper. 

Gooseberry Jam. 

Weigh out seven pounds of gooseberries, wipe them well with a cloth, cut off 
the stalks and put them in a preserving-pan with seven pounds of sugar and one pint 
of water, and boil over a clear fire. When the gooseberries are soft, remove the scum 
that forms at the top, pour them into jam jars, cover them first with paper dipped in 
brandy and then with bladder or parchment paper, tie down tightly, and keep them 
in a dry cupboard until needed. 

Grape Jam. 

Take the required quantity of ripe grapes, remove the stalks, and wipe them with 
a damp cloth to free them of any impurities, then put them into a preserving-pan, and 
stew over a gentle fire until reduced to a soft pulp. Pass the pulp through a fine 
hair-sieve, weigh it, and return it to the preserving-pan with an equal quantity of 
coarsely-crushed loaf sugar. Stir the jam. over the fire, and boil it for about twenty 
minutes longer. When ready, turn the jam into jars, leave it until cold, then put in 
each jar a round of brandied paper, cover them with parchment, and tie down. Keep 
in a dry cupboard. 

Grape Fruit Jam. 

Cut the fruit into halves and squeeze the juice into a basin, then place the rinds, 
having first removed the pips into a saucepan with plenty of water, and boil them until 
soft, then drain and steep them in cold water for several hours. Next drain all the 
water off the rinds, scrape the insides to remove all the white pith, and cut them into 
shreds. Put into a pan one pound of sugar for each pound of fruit, and boil it to the 
feather degree (see Sugar Boiling), then put in the shredded peel, and the juice 
strained through a fine hair-sieve. Boil the fruit for twenty or twenty-five minutes, 
stirring constantly, and then turn it into jars. When the jam is cold, dip some round 



PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 831 

pieces of paper cut to the size of the jars into brandy, put them over the fruit, then 
cover each jar with parchment, and tie down securely. 

Greengage Jam. 

Select sound ripe greengages, split them down the sides and remove the stones; 
put the fruit in a preserving-pan with a little water, stew them until quite tender, then 
rub the fruit through a sieve, put the pulp in the preserving-pan again, and for every 
six pounds of fruit, put in four and a half pounds of sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon 
and boil very fast, skimming off the scum as it rises. When the jam drops from the 
spoon like a thick jelly, it is done. Fill jars with it, let it cool, then cover with 
rounds of writing paper, dipped in brandy, and then with bladder. This jam should 
be kept in a dry cupboard until wanted. 

Nectarine Jam. 

Peel the nectarines, cut them in halves, crack the stones, then blanch and cut the 
kernels into small pieces. Put the pieces and broken stones into a saucepan with 
one-half pint of water for every pound of the fruit, and boil till reduced to one-half 
its quantity, then strain the liquor. Place the fruit in a preserving-pan, and add an 
equal weight of granulated sugar. Add the liquor from the stones and kernels with 
eight blanched and chopped bitter almonds for each one-fourth pound of kernels. 
Place the pan over a slow fire, and stir the contents with a wooden spoon until reduced 
to a stiff consistency. Turn the jam into jars, and leave for several hours until quite 
cold, then sift a small quantity of sugar over the top of each, cover with rounds of 
white paper that have been dipped in beaten egg, tie round the jars with twine, and 
pack them away for use. 

Peach Jam. 

Procure ripe clingstone peaches, peel them, crack the stones and blanch the kernels. 
Put the kernels in a mortar and pound them well. Put the skins and broken stones in 
a pan with twice the quantity of water required for the jam, and boil it till reduced 
one-half. Then strain the liquor through a fine hair-sieve. Put the peaches in a pre- 
serving-pan with the pounded kernels, and for every pound of fruit put in one pound 
of preserving-sugar, and a teacupful of the liquor from the stones, etc. Boil the mix- 
ture, keeping it well stirred until reduced to a stiff consistency. Fill some jars with 
the jam, and let them stand until the following day. Then sift a small quantity of 
fine sugar over each, cover them with rounds of paper that have been dipped in beaten 
egg, and tie round with twine. Keep the jars in a dry store-cupboard for use. 

Pear Jam. 

Peel some ripe pears, cut them into quarters, take out the cores, weigh them, 
and put them into an earthenware jar, packing them closely; put the jar into a sauce- 



832 PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 

pan of water on the stove, cover the jar with a piece of strong paper tied over, and 
let the water round the jar boil till the fruit is soft enough to break, then put the same 
weight of sugar as there is of fruit on the stove with two breakfast cupfuls of water to 
each pound of sugar, and boil and skim till it is a clear syrup; put the fruit into it 
and stir till it boils, and boil for twenty minutes, stirring all the time; then let it get 
a little cool, put it into jars, and when quite cold, cover as for other marmalades. 

Plum Jam. 

Have ready twelve pounds of large ripe plums peeled and divided into halves, 
crack their stones, blanch the kernels and pound them in a mortar. Put the parings 
and cracked stones into a pan with the juice of some very red beet-root, which has 
previously been pressed out in a mortar, and six pints of water. Boil this until it is 
reduced to half the original quantity, and then strain it through a fine wire sieve; put 
the fruit in a preserving-pan with the strained liquor and pounded kernels, and thirteen 
and one-half pounds of coarsely-crushed loaf sugar, place the pan over a moderate 
fire, and stir until it is reduced to a stiff jam, then turn it into pots and let it stand for 
several hours; when quite cold, sift into each jar a small quantity of caster-sugar, and 
cover with rounds of paper dipped in beaten egg, tie securely and put them away for 
future use. 

Pineapple Jam. 

Select pineapples just ripe, peel and trim, cutting into slices, and afterwards into 
small squares. Weigh the fruit, and for each pound allow one pound of caster-sugar. 
Place the fruit in a preserving-pan, stirring it constantly over the fire with a wooden 
spoon until .the juices are all extracted and quite hot, then add the sugar gradually, 
stirring the while until set; turn the jam into jam-jars and leave them in a cool place 
until the following morning; put in each jar a round of brandied paper, cover with 
parchment, tie down and put away in a dry cupboard. 

Raspberry and Cherry Jam. 

Put eight pounds of raspberries into a preserving-pan with four pounds of stoned 
cherries and boil them for fifteen minutes. Remove the scum, if any has gathered, 
and add nine pounds of sugar. Boil again for about an hour or until the jam hangs 
from the spoon, skim it again, pour it into pots, cover them when cold, and they will 
be ready for use. 

Rhubarb Jam. 

Peel and trim several stalks of rhubarb, weigh them and allow to each pound of 
rhubarb one pound of sugar and one lemon. Take a large bowl and pare as thin 
as possible the yellow rind off a lemon into it; then cut off and throw away the white 



PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 833 

part of the skin and slice the pulp of the lemon into the bowl, taking out and throw- 
ing away the seeds. Cut the rhubarb into pieces about one-half inch thick, place it 
in the bowl on the top of the lemon and place the sugar on top of the rhubarb, al- 
lowing it to stand all night. The following morning empty the bowl into a preserv- 
ing-pan, place it on the stove and let it boil very slowly for three-quarters of an hour; 
then move the pan from the stove, let the jam cool a little and put it into jars. When 
quite cold put a piece of white paper soaked in brandy on top of the jam in each jar, 
and cover so as to keep it air-tight. 

Strawberry Jam. 

Take some small or crushed strawberries being careful to throw out all the de- 
cayed ones, remove the hulls and see that the fruit is clean. Weigh it and to every 
two pounds of fruit add one and one-half pounds of sugar. Put both fruit and sugar 
into a preserving-pan and crush it slightly with a masher or a wooden spoon. Then 
put the pan on the stove and let it get hot gradually and boil a little of the jam to 
put to cool on a saucer, which jellies as it cools. It ought to be stirred occasionally 
during the boiling and any scum that arises must be taken off. When the jam is done 
remove the pan from the stove, let it cool a little and put into jars. When quite cold 
lay a piece of white paper soaked in brandy on the top of each jar and fasten them 
with a cover of paper dipped in the slightly-beaten white of egg. Keep in a cool, 
dry place. 



Carefully pick over the strawberries and half the quantity of raspberries; put the 
fruit into a preserving-pan and boil it for quarter of an hour. Skim the fruit and 
mix with it some coarsely-crushed loaf sugar, using three-fourths of a pound of sugar 
to every pound of fruit. Boil the mixture for an hour, or until it coats the spoon, 
stirring it constantly and skimming as often as required. Fill some jam pots with 
the jam and leave it until cold. Cover the jars with paper the inner side of which 
has been brushed over with the white of egg. Keep the jam in a dry store-cupboard. 



Apple Jelly. 



Pare, core and slice some good apples into a preserving-pan with enough water 
to cover them. Place on the fire and boil until they are reduced to a mash, then 
pour the mixture into a flannel bag so that the liquor cannot drain off. For each 
pound of filtered apple juice take twelve ounces of sugar, boil and remove any scum 
that may arise. When boiled sufficiently the syrup should cling to the wooden spoon; 
or a little dropped on a cold plate should set soon. Put in pots and tie down as 
with jam.

Calf's-Feet Jelly. 

Secure an unskinned calf's foot, cut it through the joints, chop the long bone 
and take away the fat; wash it well, place it in a saucepan, cover with cold water and 
boil for ten minutes. Strain off the water and wash it again. Put it in an enamelled 
saucepan, cover it entirely with cold water and stew it gently for six hours, skimming 
it constantly. When done, drain the stock into a basin, allow it to get cold, and then 
skim off the fat. In using the jelly be careful not to mix the sediment with it. 

American Crab-Apple Jelly. 

Prepare the apples by removing the stems and unsound parts, if any, and wipe 
them dry; cut them in halves, and put them into a preserving-pan with enough water 
to cover the bottom. When the fruit is quite soft pour off the water, and for every 
pint allow one pound of preserving-sugar. Place this in a preserving-pan with some 
slices of lemon-peel, and let it boil slowly for half an hour or so, removing the scum 
as it rises. Have one ounce of gelatine dissolved in some water, and just before re- 
moving the jelly from the fire stir the gelatine in rapidly. Fill some moulds or 
glasses with the jelly, and place them on ice to set. It will keep for a considerable 
time. When required dip the mould for an instant in hot water, wipe dry and turn 
out onto a glass dish, If placed in jelly-glasses they can be served in them. The 
fruit may be used for a number of other purposes. 

Cranberry Jelly. 

Wash a quantity of cranberries thoroughly. Measure them, and to every quart 
add one pound of sugar and one breakfast cupful of water. Put this in a preserving- 
pan, and place it on the side of the fire to simmer for half an hour. Then pass the 
jelly through a strainer, and when quite cool put it into pots ready for use. 

Black Currant Jelly. 

Pick the currants and pass them through a cane sieve, thus obtaining all the 
juice. Put the juice in a preserving-pan, boil it up, and then strain it through a fine 
hair-sieve. Weigh, return it to the preserving-pan, and for every three pounds of 
currants put in two and a half pounds of sugar that has been boiled down to a strong 
blow degree; skim the liquor and boil quickly till reduced to a jelly that will drop from 
the spoon in a kind of congealed state, then turn it into small glass jars. Cut some 
round pieces of white paper that will fit inside the jars, dip them in brandy and lay 
one carefully in each. Soak some bullock's bladder in water until it becomes elastic 
and can be easily stretched, then fit a small piece of it tightly over each jar, and tie 
firmly around the edges with strong twine. Keep the jars of jelly in a dry cupboard 
till wanted.

Currant Juice Jelly. 

Put an ounce of gelatine into a half pint of cold water, and soak it for two hours; 
then pour a pint and a half of boiling water over, and mix until it is dissolved; add 
the juice of a lemon, two breakfast cupfuls of loaf sugar very finely powdered, and 
the same of any currant juice. Pass through a napkin into moulds, and, when cold, 
place on the ice to set. When stiff it is ready for use. Another method is to pour 
in a layer of the jelly and let it harden; then a layer of strawberries, and continue 
alternately, until the mould is full or the jelly all used up. 

Red Currant Jelly. 

Select fine, large, red currants, pick from the stalks and place in a preserving-pan 
over a moderate fire; break the currants with a wooden spoon until the juice is ex- 
tracted; then strain through a jelly-bag, and to every breakfast cupful of juice add 
half a pound of sugar. Put both juice and sugar into a preserving-pan, set it on the 
stove, and let it come gradually to a boil. Then boil for ten minutes, and when a 
little cool, put into glasses or moulds, and when quite cold, turn out. 



Fruit Jelly. 

Boil half a pound of apple rings in one quart of water, also four ounces of tam- 
arinds and one pound of prunes in another saucepan with the same quantity of water. 
Peel and core one pound of pears, and stone one pound of dates and half a pound of 
raisins. When the tamarinds and prunes are tender, remove the stalks and stones, 
put them with their cooking liquor into a preserving-pan and add the apple rings, also 
their cooking liquor, together with the pears, dates and raisins; put in with the above 
four pounds of coarsely-crushed loaf sugar and one quart of water. Stir the whole 
over the fire and boil until the liquid is reduced to a thick syrup; then put in half a 
pound of gelatine that has been soaked in water for several hours, and continue boil- 
ing until very thick. Turn the jelly into small jars and cover them while hot. 

Gooseberry Jelly. 

Take the required quantity of ripe gooseberries, wipe them and put them in a 
preserving-pan with a little water to keep them from burning, and let them stew at 
the side of the fire until tender; then mash them, strain the juice through a sieve and 
for each pound of it add three-quarters of a pound of crushed loaf sugar. Put it into 
a stewpan, reduce until it will drop from the spoon in lumps, and turn into jars; tie 
these over tightly, and keep them in a dry place until wanted.

Grape Jelly. 

Remove the stems and put the grapes into a large stone jar, stand the jar in a 
saucepan of warm water over the fire, let the water come gradually to the boil and 
keep it boiling until the juice flows freely from the fruit, stirring it now and then with 
a wooden spoon. When the juice is out of the skins, empty the jar into a jelly-bag 
and let the juice drip through without squeezing the bag. To every quart of juice add 
a pound and a half of loaf sugar, broken small, and let it dissolve in the juice; then 
put it over the fire in a preserving-pan, and boil until clear, skimming off all scum as 
it rises. Take from the fire, let it cool a little, and put into jars and cover air-tight. 



Guava Jelly. 

Peel and cut into quarters about a hundred ripe guavas, plunge them into a bowl 
of water, wash thoroughly, place them in a saucepan with sufficient water to 
cover, and boil for two hours, or until they are perfectly tender and break easily when 
touched. Strain through a fine sieve, pressing the fruit so as to obtain as much as 
will come through easily, and allowing it to drip for a day or so if required. Pour 
the juice into a preserving-pan, and boil well, skimming often; add by degrees suffi- 
cient sugar to sweeten, boil for a few minutes, squeeze in the juice ot ten large limes, 
boil until all the scum is risen, and the jelly is clear, pour it while warm into jars, 
cover them over tightly, and let the jelly get cold. It is then ready for use. 



Pineapple Jelly. 



Select pineapples that are perfectly ripe, pare them as thin as possible and re- 
move the eyes; grate the pineapples, and to every breakfast cupful of the grated fruit 
add a quarter of a pound of white sugar, allowing it to stand for three hours. Place 
it then on the stove in a preserving-pan, and let it come slowly to a boil, and con- 
tinue boiling very gently until the fruit is quite soft; then pour it while hot into a 
jelly-bag, and have the syrup drain through without squeezing into an earthenware 
basin, leaving it in the bag until the syrup has drained from it. Then to each break- 
fast cupful of syrup add a quarter of a pound of white sugar, and boil slowly, skim- 
ming at frequent intervals. After it has been boiling for about a quarter of an hour, 
take a small quantity of it up in a saucer to cool; if it is stiff the jelly is done, if not, 
continue the boiling operation for a time longer. When done, let it cool until it is 
lukewarm, then pour into glasses. When quite cold and set, cover the glasses with 
white paper wet with brandy, dip some more pieces of white paper into beaten white 
of egg, and fasten over the tops of the glasses to keep out the air. They should keep 
until wanted if carefully prepared in this manner.

Quince Jelly. 



Choose some fine ripe quinces ; peel, core and cut them up and place them in a 
saucepan with just as much cold water as will cover them, and stew gently until ten- 
der but not red. Strain the juice from the quinces without pressing them, measure it, 
and for each cupful allow an equal quantity of crushed loaf sugar. Pour the juice 
into a preserving-pan, and boil it for twenty minutes, then add the sugar, and boil it 
until reduced to the consistency of jelly, stirring it well all the time. Skim the jelly 
and strain it through a jelly-bag. Pour it into small jars, and when quite cold, cover 
it with papers, and tie down. 

Rhubarb Jelly. 

Select eight pounds of nice ripe red rhubarb, wipe the stalks, cut them into con- 
venient lengths and put them in a stone or earthenware jar with the thinly-pared 
rinds of three large lemons. Cover the jar and place it in a moderate oven until the 
rhubarb is tender. When cooked strain the juice from the fruit into a lined sauce- 
pan, squeeze the juice of three lemons into it and boil very gently for half an hour. 
At the end of that time strain the juice through a jelly-bag and measure it and for 
every breakfast cupful allow one and one-fourth breakfast cupfuls of coarsely-c'rushed 
loaf sugar. Dissolve the sugar in the juice and boil the mixture for forty- five min- 
utes, keeping it well stirred and skimmed all the time. Pour the jelly into jars and 
leave it until the following day; then put into each jar a round of paper that has been 
dipped in brandy and cover them with parchment, tying them down tightly. Keep 
the jelly in a drv store-cupboard. 

Lemon Mixture for Puddings. 

Pare as thin as possible the rinds of four large lemons and mince them fine; 
squeeze the juice out of half a dozen lemons and strain it. Put one-half pound of 
butter into a saucepan to melt, then put in the peel and juice with two pounds of loaf 
sugar, the beaten whites of eight and the yolks of twelve eggs, stir the mixture over 
a very slow fire until thick; then pour it into a jar, mix in one wineglassful of whisky 
or brandy, cover with the parchment and tie down tightly. 



Apple Marmalade. 



Take the apples to be used after cutting them into quarters and peeling them, 
and place them in a stewpan with a little water and powdered sugar. Leave them 
over a slow fire until reduced to a pulp; then still further reduce by simmering until 
the marmalade clings to the spoon. Cool and serve in a compote-dish or store away 
in jars to keep. If required for immediate use, sprinkle some sugar over the top and 
glaze with a hot salamander.

Apricot Marmalade. 

Select some quite ripe apricots, stone and pass them through a sieve. Put into 
a preserving-pan two-thirds as much sugar as the quantity of apricots used, and 
mix in with the apricots, set the pan over the stove and allow the marmalade to reduce 
slowly till it coats the spoon and falls in large drops from it. Add some of the 
kernels of the apricots blanched in hot water and dried, and pour it into jars as you 
would jams. Apricot marmalade and apricot jam are virtually the same thing. 

Cherry Marmalade. 

Remove the stones and stems from the required number of cherries; crush the 
stones, place them in a saucepan with a little water, and boil them until the flavor is 
extracted. Put the fruit in a preserving-pan with a small quantity of water and boil 
until it is reduced to a pulp, stirring it occasionally with a wooden spoon to prevent 
it from sticking to the bottom and burning. Put three-quarters of a pound of loaf 
sugar to every pound of fruit into the strained water in which the stones have been 
boiled, and boil until small, transparent bubbles appear on the top. Mix the clari- 
fied sugar with the fruit and continue stirring it over the fire until thick and smooth 
Turn the marmalade into small glasses or jars, allow it to get cold, then tie them over, 
and put in a dry store-cupboard until required. 

Red Currant Marmalade. 

Take two quarts of ripe red currants, pick off the stalks and put them in a 
preserving-pan with two breakfast cupfuls of raspberry juice, and boil gently. When 
the currants begin to break mix one pint of syrup boiled to the candying degree with 
them and boil the whole until reduced to a thick pulp. Skim the marmalade, flavor 
with rose-water, and pour into jars. When the marmalade is cold, cover the jars w'th 
brandied papers and tie down tightly. Keep in a cool place. 



Lemon Marmalade. 

Soak six or eight ounces of lemon peel in brine for several days. Before pre- 
serving, soak the peels in pure water until the taste of the salt is entirely extracted 
and boil till soft enough to pierce with a straw. Place in a copper preserving-pan 
nine pounds of preserving-sugar and one quart of water, when boiling, put in the 
lemon-peel and three pounds of apples cut in slices. Stir all over the fire until very 
thick. When done, turn the marmalade into jars and leave till very cold. Cover 
them tightly and keep in a dry cupboard until wanted for use.

Orange Marmalade. 

Squeeze out all the juice from the required number of Seville oranges and strain 
it, pour over the pulp of the oranges as much water as will cover it, and let it steep 
for an hour. Afterwards strain the liquor off from the oranges and mix it with the 
juice. For each quart of juice allow three pounds of loaf sugar, boil it to the bubble 
(see Sugar Boiling), mix in the orange juice and boil it for about fifteen minutes, 
keeping it well skimmed. Turn the marmalade into pots, and when cold, cover and 
tie them down. 

Peach Marmalade. 

Put some ripe autumn peaches that have been peeled and stoned in layers in a 
deep dish, cover them thickly with crushed loaf sugar and leave them for twenty- 
four hours. Place the peaches in a preserving-pan putting in one pound of sugar for 
each pound of peaches. Boil till thick, then pass them through a fine hair-sieve. 
Crack the stones, peel a few of the kernels, boil them in a little thin syrup and mix 
with the marmalade. When cold, put it in a glass-dish, and serve. 



Pineapple Marmalade. 

Small pineapples should be used for this, and they should be peeled, and all 
eyes and discolored portions carefully removed; then cut into small pieces, weigh 
them, and use three-quarters of a pound of crushed loaf sugar for every pound of the 
fruit; place the pieces of pineapple in an earthenware jar, stand the jar in a saucepan 
of water and boil until they become quite clear. Place the sugar in a preserving-pan 
with a teacupful of water for each two pounds of sugar and add the fruit, when the 
whole may be boiled for half an hour. Then move the pan off the fire and let the 
marmalade cool, when it should be placed in jars. Put a round of white paper 
soaked in brandy on each jar, then cover with heavy paper tying it down well. 



Plum Marmalade. 

Stone and peel some ripe plums and lay them in a deep dish and cover them 
thickly with caster-sugar, place in a cool spot and leave until the following morning. 
Put them in a preserving-pan with one pound of crushed loaf sugar for every pound 
of the fruit used, weighing them after they have been stoned, and boil until they are 
reduced to a pulp; crack some of the stones and boil the kernels in the marmalade, 
then turn the marmalade into jars and leave it until quite cold. Cover over with 
paper, and tie down tightly.

Quince Marmalade. 



Peel and cut into thin slices four pounds of quinces; place them in a preserving- 
pan with two pounds of peeled and sliced apples and two quarts of water in which a 
little lemon juice has been squeezed. Place the cover on the pan and boil the con- 
tents quickly till softened; then put in three pounds of crushed loaf sugar and stir it 
over the fire with a wooden spoon until of a thick paste. Remove the pan from the 
fire, pour the marmalade into jars and leave it until cold. Place brandied paper in 
each jar and tie them down. 



Raspberry Marmalade. 



To each pound of raspberries allow one-half pound of sugar. Hull and pick 
the raspberries, pass them through a sieve and place the pulp over the fire; stir it 
continually until it is reduced to one-half. Have ready some clarified sugar boiled 
to the ball degree (see Sugar Boiling), and when the raspberry pulp is reduced to 
half its original quantity pour it over; stir them well together, give the marmalade a 
few boils, take it from the fire, allow it to cool a little and put it into pots. When 
quite cold lay over the marmalade in each pot a piece of white paper dipped in 
brandy and cover air-tight. 

Rhubarb Marmalade. 

String and cut into very small pieces four stalks of rhubarb. Peel thin half a 
dozen oranges and cut the rind into thin shreds; free the oranges from all the white 
pith, cut them into slices, and remove the seeds. Put the rhubard into the pan with 
the oranges, their peels and one and one-half pounds of coarsely-crushed loaf sugar 
and stand the pan over a slow fire. Stir the mixture until reduced to the usual con- 
sistency of marmalade; then turn it into jars and leave it till the following day. Place 
in each jar a round of white paper that has been dipped in brandy, cover them with 
parchment and tie down. This marmalade is delicious, and will keep for quite a long 
time. 

Mince-meat. 

This word evidently takes its original meaning from the French and signifies 
anything that is minced or chopped up fine. From the following recipes it will be 
seen that mince-meat may be prepared in a variety of ways, many cooks having a 
special recipe according to their own fancy and from which they make their 
mince pies. 

(i) Mix together one pound each of raisins, cleaned currants, apples, boiled 
pickled beef- tongue and flesh from calf's feet, all finely chopped; also one-half pound 
each of chopped beef suet and candied peel, one-half pound of sugar, one teaspoonful 



PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 841 

of mixed spices, moistening with three tumblerfuls of wine and brandy in equal pro- 
portions, together with the strained juice of two lemons. 

(2) Cut off about two pounds from the inside of a boiled sirloin of beef, remove 
the skin and add about five pounds of beef suet and mince fine. Then add eight 
good-sized apples peeled, cored and chopped, six pounds of cleaned currants, the 
grated crumb of a small loaf of bread, one and one-half pounds of sugar, one ounce 
of grated nutmeg, one-half ounce of cloves, the grated peel of a lemon and orange, 
moistening with the juice of six oranges and three lemons and two tumblerfuls each 
of brandy and sherry wine. Pack away in jars. 

Lemon Mincemeat. 

Boil four ripe, thin-skinned lemons in one quart of water until reduced to one 
pint, then squeeze and strain the juice of the lemons into two pounds of powdered 
sugar; mince the rind and pulp of the lemons taking care to remove all the seeds, 
stone and chop one pound of raisins and mince fine two pounds of suet, mix them 
with the lemons, adding two pounds of well-washed and dried currants, one ounce of 
mixed ground spices, one-half pint of brandy and port wine in equal quantities, and 
the water in which the lemons were boiled. The mince-meat should be kept in a jar 
tightly covered until wanted for use. 

Orange Ratafia. 

Take six thick-skinned Seville oranges, cut off the yellow rinds as thin as 
possible and put them in a jar. Cut the six oranges into halves, squeeze the juice 
from them, strain it and add it to the peels in the jar; put in one pound of powdered 
sugar and stir in the orange juice till quite dissolved, then pour over it two quarts of 
brandy. Close the jar air-tight, let it stand for one month, strain it, put it into 
bottles, and cork them well. 

Apricot Paste. 

Make a very firm apricot jam, pour it upon a clean baking-sheet, and put it in a 
very slow oven to dry. When set, stamp out or cut into any shapes, such as rings, 
ovals, etc., and place in trays to be dried on a screen. Cover with paper. When 
quite dry they should be dusted with fine sugar and packed in tin boxes for use when 
required. 

Chestnut Paste. 

Boil some chestnuts in water until they are soft. Then peel, skin and rub through 
a sieve; pound, and to every three-quarters of a pound of pounded chestnuts add one- 
fourth of a pound of marmalade (cherry, orange, or any other sort that may be pre- 
ferred), and one pound of sugar. When weighed, boil to the feather degree the 



842 PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 

requisite quantity of sugar; that is, the degree of heat at which if a skimmerful of 
sugar be taken up and shaken the sugar will emit large sparks which will adhere 
together on rising. When the sugar is at this degree, mix it thoroughly with the 
pounded chestnuts and marmalade, place in moulds, and bake. 

Lemon Paste. 

Squeeze the juice out of some lemons, then boil the rinds until very tender. 
Drain, scrape out all of the pulp, place the rinds in a mortar and pound them. Put 
the paste onto a sieve, press it through with a spatula into a preserving-pan, and 
reduce until thick, weigh the pulp, and for every pound use two pounds of loaf sugar. 
Clarify the sugar and boil to the feather degree (see Sugar Boiling), then mix in the 
lemon paste and boil up again. Spread the paste on plates, put it in the stove for a 
day, then remove it, cut it into strips, and shape it into any form desired. 

Candied Pear Paste. 

Boil some pear marmalade till greatly reduced in quantity. Color half of it with 
a few drops of prepared cochineal, turn each half on a clean plate, and leave till they 
are cold. With some tin cutters cut the paste into squares, diamonds, ovals, leaves, 
rings, etc.; dip each with a fork in a carameled syrup, place them out of hand on a 
trellised wire drainer, and leave them till dry. 

Plum Paste. 

Put into a preserving-pan some stoned plums with a little water and boil to a 
pulp, pass through a fine sieve, pressing gently into a pan and boil, stirring well until 
the contents become a thick pulp. Then weigh it, and to each pound use ten ounces 
of sugar ; place the sugar in a preserving-pan, clarify and boil it to the feather; add 
the fruit pulp, and boil for about a minute longer, and, when done, pour onto a flat 
sheet of tin, spread it with a knife, and place it in a warm closet for a day. Shape 
the paste, and put into boxes or tins, with paper between each layer, when it will 
keep until wanted. 

Quince Paste. 

Put the required number of quinces in water till they are soft, then pound and 
pass them through a sieve. Weigh the pulp, and put into a preserving-pan an equal 
weight of crushed loaf sugar, boil it to the feather degree (see Sugar Boiling), add 
the mashed quinces, and stir them over the fire until boiling gently. Pour the paste 
into shallow tin-dishes, and leave it until set. Cut the paste into leaves, rings, etc., 
place them on a wire tray, and dry in a screen. Pack in boxes between layers of 
paper. If liked, the paste may be colored by adding a little liquid carmine to the 
pulp before it is mixed with the sugar.

Pickled Grapes. 

Select large but not ripe grapes, cut into small bunches, and fill a stone jar with 
them, putting vine leaves between the bunches. Dissolve one pound of bay salt and 
a little common salt in one quart of cold water, put it into a copper pan, boil and 
remove the scum as it rises to the top. When it has boiled for quarter of an hour, 
let it stand until cool. Pour the liquor over the grapes, put more vine leaves on the 
top, and tie down with a folded linen cloth. Boil two quarts of vinegar together 
with one quart of water and one pound of brown sugar for a few minutes, skim, and 
let it stand until quite cold; strain the grapes. Dry the jar, put fresh vine leaves at 
the bottom between the layers of the grapes and on the top, and pour the clear 
pickle over all. Tie a thin piece of board in a piece of flannel, lay it on the top of 
the jar, cover it with bladder and then with leather, and tie it down tightly. 

Pickled Peaches. 

Allow to fourteen pounds of peaches weighed after peeling, three quarts of 
vinegar and six pounds of brown sugar. Mix together in a plate or saucer a table- 
spoonful of blades of mace, two ounces of stick cinnamon broken up into small 
pieces, one teaspoonful of cloves. Lay at the bottom of a two-gallon jar about one 
quart of the peaches, cover with sugar, and sprinkle over a portion of the mixed 
spices. Then lay in more peaches covering as before with sugar and spices. Pro- 
ceed in this manner till the jar is full or till all the peaches, sugar and spice are used. 
Then pour in the vinegar, put a plate or saucer over the fruit to keep it well under 
the vinegar, tie a cloth tight over the top of the jar, and set it over the fire in a sauce- 
pan half-full of cold water. Let the water boil till the peaches are soft enough to 
pierce with a straw. 

Pickled Pears. 

Peel six pounds of pears, stick two cloves in each, put them in a lined preserv- 
ing-pan in which three pounds of crushed loaf sugar and one pint of vinegar are boil- 
ing. Cook the pears till tender, then turn all into stone jars. When cold tie them 
down. 

Pickled Plums. 

Select plums not too ripe, prick them well all over with a fork, arrange them in 
layers in a jar with cinnamon and cloves and orange-peel between each layer, cover 
over with vinegar, and soak them in this for twenty-four hours, at the end of which 
time strain off the vinegar into a saucepan, boil it up quickly for about ten minutes, 
and let it become cool, then pour it over the fruit. After the lapse of twenty-four 
hours again strain the vinegar, boil it for ten minutes with some sugar, six ounces to 
every quart of the liquid, pour it over the fruit, and leave it until cold. Cover the 
jars with stout paper, tie securely, and keep them in a dry place. 



844 PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 

Preserved American or Siberian Crab-Apples. 

Gather the apples just prior to their becoming ripe, select carefully, cut the stems 
short, and then plunge the fruit into boiling-water for a few minutes until the skin of 
any one of them begins to crack. Take from the fire, strain through an earthenware 
colander, and they may then be easily peeled. Great care must be taken when peel- 
ing the apples to keep them very clean and perfect in shape. Before starting to do 
this make a thin syrup of one pound of loaf sugar to about one pint of water, and 
keep it boiling hot until all the apples are peeled and dropped into a large glass jar. 
When a sufficient number are done pour the hot syrup over them, and store away in 
a cool pantry. The following day strain off again, place the syrup in a stewpan 
with one-fourth pound more sugar to each pint; then boil and skim. Return the 
apples to the jar and pour the hot syrup over a second time. If on the day following 
the syrup looks clear, and the fruit is soft, they may be considered ready for tying 
down, though there will be no harm in repeating the boiling process once or twice 
more in order to insure immunity from mould. 

Preserved Apples. 

Core, pare and slice some pippins and put to each pound of apples half a pound 
of preserving-sugar, and to each eight pounds thus sweetened, one quart of water to- 
gether with a few cloves and the thin rind and juice of a lemon. Stew till the apples 
are clear, and put up in wide-mouthed bottles or jars for future use. 

Preserved Cherries. 

The large red variety of cherries, usually used for pies, and the Morello cherry 
are the best for preserves. They should be fresh and sound, and the larger the better. 
Remove the stems and stones from the cherries, being careful not to bruise them. 
Then weigh the cherries, and allow their own weight in sugar ; shake the sugar over 
the cherries, and stir in with them and allow them to stand all night in order that the 
sugar may harden the cherries slightly. In the morning put all into the preserving- 
pan, place on the stove, allow it to get hot gradually, and boil gently until the cher- 
ries look clear, skimming off the scum as it rises. When the cherries have become 
quite clear, remove the pan from the stove, cover it over and let the preserve cool. 
When cold, put it into glass jars, dip pieces of white paper in brandy and place on 
the tops of the jars, and cover them tightly so as to keep out the air. Keep in a 
cool, dark place. 

Preserved Chestnuts. 

Take the brown skins off some chestnuts and put them in boiling water until the 
light skins can be removed. Have some syrup ready, put the chestnuts in, stand by 



PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 845 

the fire and let simmer for several hours, every little while adding a little more syrup. 
The syrup should thicken while simmering, otherwise it would get mouldy. Heat 
the chestnuts two days in this manner, then take out and drain. Boil some syrup to 
the blow degree in a small pan, and when it is cool, work it until it has a gloss. Dip 
the chestnuts in this, drain on a wire-sieve and dry in a oven for two minutes. 

Preserved Cucumbers. 

Select small, well-formed cucumbers, boil for two or three minutes; take out of 
the water and pierce with a needle in three or four places and let drain. Allow to 
every pound of cucumber one pound of sugar and one pint of water; put all in a 
stewpan; add one stick of ginger and the rind of a lemon; simmer at side of the fire 
for about five minutes. Then take out the cucumbers and place in a jar; skim the 
syrup and pour over them; cover the jar tightly and let stand for two or three days. 
Strain off the syrup, give it another boiling, pour it again over the cucumbers, tie a 
bladder on the jar and keep in a cool place. 

Red Currant Preserve. 

Pick four pounds of red currants from the stalks and put them into a pan over 
the fire to dry; next press them through a sieve and put back again over the fire, stir- 
ring constantly until the liquor becomes so clear that the bottom of the pan can be 
seen Melt six pounds of sugar over the fire and boil to the ball degree, which is as- 
certained by dipping the finger into cold water, then instantly into the boiling sugar, 
and back immediately into the cold water. If the sugar will roll from the finger in a 
little ball, can be crumbled between the fingers, and will stick to the teeth if bitten, 
the sugar is boiled to this state. Then pour the sugar over the currants and keep 
stirring them. In a short time, remove from the fire but continue stirring until the 
liquor bubbles, then turn it into moulds. 

Fruit Preserved in Ginger Syrup. 

Put one pound of finely-broken white ginger into a saucepan with more than suf- 
ficient water to cover it and boil until the water is highly seasoned with the ginger; 
then add any firm fruit, boil until done, turn all into a jar and leave for four or five 
days, giving it a frequent stir. Put into a saucepan one pound of loaf sugar, half a 
pint of brandy, the peel of a lemon and juice of half a lemon, pour in a little of the 
ginger water and boil to a syrup. Skim well, add the fruit, boil for ten or twelve 
minutes, remove from the fire and leave for a week; then strain off the sugar, boil up 
again, put the fruit back and boil for fifteen minutes longer. Turn the preserve into 
pots, cover with paper soaked in brandy and then with wet parchment, and leave for 
a month before using.

Preserved Fruit Juice. 

The juice of fruit may be kept for some time by putting it in tins the same as 
whole fruits. Mash the fruit, press it to extract as much of the juice as possible and 
then pass it through a fine hair-sieve. Measure the juice and put it in a pan with 
three pounds of preserving-sugar to each quart. Fill some jars with the syrup, cover 
them, stand them in a saucepan with cold water to three parts their height, and boil 
for half an hour. Leave the jars in the water until cool, then seal and put them away 
for use. 

Preserved Gooseberries. 

Put into a preserving-pan five pounds of gooseberries with one pound of sugar 
dusted over them and set the pan on the fire; when the juice commences to come out 
take off the pan. Repeat this process for two days more, then take the gooseberries 
out of the syrup, drain them on sieves and place them to dry either before the fire or 
in the sun, the latter for preference. After taking out of the pan, they may be 
dipped in fine sugar and packed away in boxes. 

Preserved Grapes. 

Select grapes that are ripe and quite sound. Pick off the stalks and weigh the 
fruit and to every pound of grapes allow one pound of sugar. Squeeze the pulp out 
of the skins, putting the pulp in one bowl and the skins in another. Put the sugar 
into a preserving-pan with one breakfast cupful of water to each pound, and let it boil 
until clear, removing the scum as it rises. When it is quite clear put the pulp of the 
grapes into it and boil for two minutes; then turn it out into a hair-sieve and rub it 
through with the back of a wooden spoon to get the pips out. Put it back into the 
preserving-pan without the pips, add the skins and boil for two or three minutes, or 
until the skins fill and look plump; then let it cool and put it into jars and cover 
them to keeo out the air. 

Preserved Lemons. 

Select sound and moderately thick-skinned lemons, remove a piece about one- 
half inch in diameter from the stalk end, and with a blunt knife remove all the in- 
sides. Place the peels in cold water, leave them for a day or two, changing the 
water three or four times a day, then put them into a saucepan with more cold water 
and boil until quite tender, keeping the pan covered and boiling slowly. Prepare a 
syrup, using about two pounds of sugar and one pint of water to each pound of fruit; 
add the juice of one lemon, clarify the syrup, skim, and allow it to get cold. Put in 
the peels and boil for half an hour, or until quite clear. They are then ready for 
packing away. 



PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 847 

Preserved Nectarines. 

Pare some nectarines, cut them in halves to remove the stones, put them into a 
saucepan of boiling water, and cook gently at the side of the fire. As soon as the 
fruit floats on top, take them out and put on a strainer to drain. Weigh them and to 
every pound add three-fourths of a pound of clarified sugar; put the fruit and sugar into 
a preserving-pan, boil until the syrup is nearly clear, then place them with the syrup 
on one side to cool. Let the whole remain for a day, then drain off the syrup 
and boil till it becomes quite thick; add the fruit and boil for a short time. Repeat 
this once more, and, lastly, pour the whole into a deep dish and let it remain for two 

days. Put it into pots or jars, cover them tightly, and the preserve is ready for use. 

i 

Preserved Peaches. 

Take some large, juicy peaches, peel and quarter them. Crack half the stones 
and blanch the kernels. Weigh the peaches, lay them in a deep dish mixing with 
them the blanched kernels, and one pound of powdered white sugar to every pound 
of peaches; cover and let them remain all night. Next day put all the contents of 
the dish into a preserving-pan, and boil them till they look clear, and are quite soft, 
removing all the scum as it rises. When the fruit is soft and clear, take the pan 
from the fire, let it cool a little, and then put the preserve into jars. When quite 
cold lay a piece of white paper dipped in brandy on top of the preserve in each jar, 
and cover the jars air-tight. 

Preserved Pears. 

Pears for preserving should be firm and rather sour; if they are small they 
should be preserved whole; if medium-sized, cut them in halves; if large, in quarters. 
Peel them with a silver knife, dropping each pear in a basin of cold water as soon as 
peeled to keep the color nice. When the pears are all peeled and, if necessary, cut, 
weigh them, allowing an equal weight of sugar; put the fruit in a saucepan on the 
stove with enough cold water to cover it completely and let it boil gently until soft 
enough to yield slightly to gentle pressure with the fingers. While the pears are 
boiling put the sugar in a preserving- pan; to each pound of sugar add two breakfast 
cupfuls of cold water, and to every five or six pounds of the juice the thinly-pared 
rind of two lemons and two ounces of green ginger root scraped and scalded; boil 
the syrup, taking off the scum as it rises. When the fruit is tender put it in the pre- 
serving-pan with the syrup and boil till the pears look clear, then remove from the 
fire and let the preserve cool in the syrup and then put in jars, fastening so as to be 
air-tight. 

Preserved Pineapple. 

Select thoroughly-ripe pineapples, peel and cut them into slices. Weigh them, 
and allow three-quarters of a pound of crushed loaf sugar to each pound of the fruit 






848 PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 

and place them in a preserving-pan in layers, with sugar between each layer, leaving 
them over night. On the following morning put the pan over rather a slow fire, and 
when the pineapples are very hot, but not soft, remove them, drain each slice and lay 
on a dish. Continue boiling the syrup until thickly reduced. Pack the slices in glass 
jars, pour in a half wineglassful of rum and enough of the syrup to fill them and let 
them get quite cold, after which put in each jar a round of white paper dipped in 
brandy, cover with parchment and tie securely. Keep in a dry place until wanted 

Preserved Plums. 

Procure some full-grown, quite ripe plums, prick and place them in a saucepan 
of cold water over the fire; take off immediately when the water is on the point of 
boiling, drain, put them into clarified sugar, boil thoroughly and allow them to settle 
and boil once more. If they shrink, and do not take the sugar, prick them again 
without taking them from the syrup and boil again; skim the syrup and remove the 
pan from the fire, allowing it to stand over night. The following day add to the fruit 
and syrup in the pan some sugar boiled to the blow degree and boil them once more, 
place in the stove and let them stand there all night. The following day drain the 
plums from the syrup, sprinkle them with a little powdered sugar, and dry in the stove. 

Preserved Prunes. 

Wash well two or three pounds of prunes, and place them in a saucepan with 
enough water to cover them, adding the grated rind of a lemon; set the pan over a 
slow fire and cook gently until the fruit is quite tender, then remove, and pass 
through a sieve. To each pound of the pulp, use three-quarters of a pound of sugar; 
place the sugar in a preserving-pan with a little water, and, when it is melted, add the 
pulp. Boil it for fifteen minutes longer, skimming frequently. Keep the preserves 
in jars or pots until used. 

Preserved Quinces. 

Carefully peel and core the required quantity of quinces, removing both from 
parings and fruit everything that is not perfectly good. Cut the quinces either into 
quarters or across into slices, put them in a preserving-pan over the fire in a very little 
water, and cover them with the parings. Place the cover on the pan to keep the 
steam in, and allow the fruit to simmer till soft. Take out the slices or quarters of 
quinces, and strain the liquor in the pan through a jelly-bag. Put the strained juice 
once more over the fire in a pan, together with one pound of loaf sugar to every pint 
of juice, and keep stirring this until the sugar has entirely melted and has come to 
the boil, then let it boil for ten minutes, skimming off the scum as it comes to the 
surface. Put in the 'quinces, and let them simmer in the syrup for twenty minutes. 
When they look clear and are well sweetened, lift them out with a skimmer, first tak-

ing the pan from the fire, and put them into glass jars. Allow the syrup to cool a 
little, and pour it over them warmed. When quite cold, lay a piece of white paper 
dipped in brandy on top of the preserves in each jar, and cover the jars air-tight. 

Preserved Raspberries. 

Large raspberries are best; they should be quite ripe, and care should be exer- 
cised to see that there are no insects in the hollows of the fruit. Weigh them, and to 
every pound of raspberries allow a pound of sugar. Put the raspberries and sugar in 
alternate layers in a preserving-pan, being careful to have a layer of sugar at the bot- 
tom and also at the top, and let them stand in the sugar all night. In the morning, 
pick off the stems from some ripe red currants, bruise them, and squeeze the juice 
out through a cloth. Add one breakfast cupful of this juice to every two pounds of 
raspberries and sugar weighed together; add the currant juice to the raspberries and 
sugar already in the pan, put it on the stove and stir gently until it boils. Re- 
move all the scum as it rises, and continue stirring to keep the raspberries from stick- 
ing, but be careful not to break them. Continue to boil until clear, let them cool a 
little, and put them into jars. When cold, cover, and stand them away in a cool dark 
place. 

Preserved Strawberries. 

Put two pounds of strawberries at the bottom of a preserving-pan, pour over two 
breakfast cupfuls of red or white currant juice, cover with finely-crushed loaf sugar 
and again with a sheet of paper, place the pan at the side of the fire and let it 
remain until the strawberries are slightly warm. Remove the pan from the fire, take 
the strawberries out carefully with a wooden spoon and put them on a sieve to drain. 
Add a little more sugar to the syrup, boil it to the pearl degree (see Sugar Boiling), 
put back the fruit and let it simmer gently for a few minutes. Remove the straw- 
berries, put them carefully into a basin, pour over the syrup and let them remain for 
a couple of days. Take them out again, drain, put the syrup back in the pan, add a 
little more sugar and a small quantity of currant juice and boil again to the pearl 
degree, put in the strawberries, simmer for a few minutes, put them carefully into 
jars, pour the syrup in so as to not quite fill the jars, let them get cold, cover over 
first with paper soaked in brandy, then with thick paper or a bladder, put the jars in 
a cool place and let them remain until wanted. For preserving strawberries only the 
largest fruit should be used. 

Strawberry Shrub. 

Hull twelve pounds of ripe strawberries, crush and mash them and squeeze the 
juice from them through a cloth. Put the juice in a pan over the fire together with 
the strained juice of half a dozen good-sized lemons, bring it to the boil and let it 



850 PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 

boil fast for five minutes; then add six pounds of loaf sugar and when this has melted 
let it boil for six minutes longer. Remove it from the fire, let it cool, skimming as 
it cools, and when quite cold mix in one and one-half pints of brandy or whiskey. 
Bottle it being very particular to see that the bottles are perfectly clean. They 
should first be well washed in soda and water and then rinsed out with boiling water. 
Cork the bottles with new corks soaked in cold water. Cut them off even with the 
top, seal with sealing-wax or bees-wax and rosin melted together in equal quantities, 
and lay the bottles on their sides in dry sawdust. 



Sugared Quinces. 



Select good, firm quinces, rub them over with a damp cloth in order to remove 
the dust, cut each one into eight pieces and remove the cores. Place the quinces in 
a preserving-pan on the stove, pour over them enough boiling water to cover, and 
allow them to boil slowly until they are tender; then drain off the water and let them 
get cold. Weigh the quinces and allow an equal weight of sugar. The peels and 
cores should have been tied in a muslin bag and boiled with the quinces. When the 
quinces are quite cold put them and the sugar into glass or earthenware jars in alter- 
nate layers, first sugar, then quinces, and so on and cover. When covering make 
sure that the air is entirely excluded. Look at them from time to time to see whether 
any show signs of fermentation; if there is any, place the jars in a pan of hot water and 
loosen the covers, let the water boil until the quinces are well scalded, then cover the 
jars down carefully as before. 



Chocolate Syrup. 



Mix half a pound of scraped chocolate cake with one quart of water, add four 
pounds of loaf-sugar, and stir over a slow fire until the chocolate is dissolved and the 
sugar syruped. 

Currant Syrup. 

Select red, white or black currants taking care that the fruit is fully ripe, and 
pick over carefully to free from any rotten ones. Mash the currants in an earthen- 
ware crock with a vegetable masher and let it stand for twenty-four hours, at a tem- 
perature of from 75 to 85 degrees, Fahrenheit. Keep the crock covered with a cloth, 
stirring the contents once in a while; then press out the juice through a sieve, 
measure, and leave it for the night. In the morning add one wineglassful of brandy 
to every pint of juice; allow this to macerate for a few hours and then filter. After 
filtering put the juice into a sugar boiler, and stir in a pound and a half of crushed 
loaf sugar for every pint, heat to boiling, skim and stand in clean bottles previously 
rinsed out with a little brandy. Cork well, and capsule or wax over. 



PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 851 

Red Currant Syrup. 

Place the required quantity of freshly-picked red currants in a bowl and mash 
them with a wooden spoon; cover the bowl and let them stand for three or four 
hours. Strain the juice through a jelly-bag, measure it and put into a sugar boiler 
with three-quarters of a pound of lump sugar to each pint of juice. Boil until 
reduced to a clear syrup keeping it well skinned; then take off the fire and leave 
until cold. Pour the syrup into small bottles, pour a little fresh salad oil on the top 
of each to preserve it, and put them in an upright position in a dry cupboard until 
required, 

Raspberry Syrup. 



Put six pounds of raspberries into an earthenware pan, press them gently, sprinkle 
with four ounces of crushed loaf sugar, and let them remain for ten or twelve hours. 
Pass the juice through a very fine sieve, measure it, pour it into a preserving-pan, and 
boil for twenty minutes skimming frequently. To each breakfast cupful of the juice 
add four ounces of loaf sugar roughly crushed; boil until the liquor commences to 
thicken, pour it into an earthenware bowl to cool, and then into bottles. Cork and 
seal them, and stand them in a dry place until wanted. 

Strawberry Syrup. 

Put six pounds of perfectly ripe and dry strawberries into a bowl, pour over 
them six quarts of cold water in which two and one-half ounces of tartaric acid 
has been mixed, and let them stand for twenty-four hours. Strain the liquor care- 
fully off the fruit, measure it and for each pint use one pound of finely-crushed 
loaf sugar. Pour the syrup into bottles, cork them, tie down with twine, and dip 
the nozzle in melted rosin. Keep the syrup in a dry store-cupboard. 

Essence of Vanilla. 

Cut three vanilla beans into very small shreds, put them into a bottle with one 
pint of brandy, and cork the bottle. Shake the vanilla occasionally and in the 
course of three months' time it will be ready for use. 

Extract of Vanilla. 

Cut and chop very fine two or three vanilla beans, or pound them in a 
mortar. Stir in with them a small quantity of powdered sugar. Put the vanilla and 
sugar into a pint bottle, add to it one tablespoonful of water, and allow it to stand 
all night. The next day pour on it one-half pint of spirits of wine, cork it well, 
and let it stand for a month, shaking it well every day. 



852 PRESERVES, JAMS, ETC. 

Vanilla Flavoring. 

Steep one dram of freshly-sliced vanilla bean in one pint of ninety-five per cent, 
alcohol for twenty days. At the end of that time filter the liquor, and bottle it ready 
for use. 

Vanilla Sugar. 

Cut up one pound of Mexican vanilla beans, place them in a mortar with one pound 
of loaf sugar, and pound them to a fine powder. Sift the sugar through a fine hair- 
sieve, turn what is left in the sieve into the mortar, and pound again. When all is 
finely-powdered and sifted, put the sugar in bottles, and keep them tightly corked. 



Pickles and Condiments. 

Bottled Tomatoes. 

Cut off the stems and green parts from four or five pounds of ripe tomatoes, 
divide them into small pieces, put them into a stewpan with two onions, two bay- 
leaves, three or four cloves, and pepper and salt to taste. Boil them, stirring at the 
same time until tender, then turn the pulp onto a fine sieve with a basin underneath 
to catch the liquor as it runs through. When all the juice has drained from the 
tomatoes put it in the stewpan, and boil until reduced to half its original quantity. 
Pass the pulp through a sieve, but do not allow the onions or bay-leaves to go 
through, and mix it with the reduced liquor. Turn the conserve into wide-mouthed 
bottles, cork them and tie them down. Place the bottles in a saucepan with some 
straw between them to prevent their breaking and cold water up to their necks, and 
boil them for thirty minutes or so. Afterward leave them in water off the fire until 
cold. Wipe them, dip their nozzles in bottle-wax, and place them in a dry store-cup- 
board for future use. 

Burnt Onions. 

Peel one-half pound of onions, place in a saucepan with a breakfast cupful of 
water, and cook for five minutes. Add eight ounces of moist sugar and simmer gently 
until the mixture is almost black. Pour in one gill of boiling vinegar, stirring well 
with a wooden spoon, and it is then ready for use. It may be poured into bottles 
and kept if required. 

Cayenne Pepper. 

For this, thick-skinned, fine, long red peppers must be used. Spread about one- 
half pound of them on a tray, and dry in the open air, but not in the sun; then re- 
move all the stalks, place them in a mortar and pound them thoroughly. Put the 
cayenne into jars and it is then ready for use. The mortar should be covered over 
with a cloth while pounding in order to prevent the dust from flying into the eyes of 
the operator. 

Chow-Chow. 

Cut into small pieces two heads of white cabbage and boil them until they are 
quite tender; then take two heads of cauliflower, cut them up, place them in a sep- 
arate pan, and boil; also one quart of small onions, a dozen small cucumbers, one-half 
gallon of small tomatoes and six roots of chopped celery; cooking all in separate

854 PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 

pans. Then put two gallons of vinegar, four ounces each of ground mustard and 
mustard seed, a small pot of French mustard, two ounces of turmeric and one ounce 
of cloves into a pan and set this over the fire. When it boils mix all the vegetables 
together and pour the liquor over them. Let it get cold and then put it into jars; 
cover these over and tie down. 

Chutney. 

Remove the peelings and cores from two or three pounds of green cooking- 
apples, chop them up, put them into a saucepan with three breakfast cupfuls of vine- 
gar, and boil them to a pulp. Pour this pulp out into a basin and when cold mix in 
one ounce each of garlic and chillies, two ounces of shallots, all finely minced, one 
ounce of ground ginger, two ounces of salt, four ounces each of mustard seed and 
tamarinds, three-quarters of a pound of stoned and chopped raisins, and one pound 
of moist sugar, and stir all well together. Place the chutney in bottles, lay them near 
the fire for several days, cork them up and keep in a cold place until required. This 
is always best for preserving them. 

Mango Chutney. 

This can be prepared by using the refuse from mango sauce with the addition of 
a little thick syrup, a few dried dates, hot spices and ground stoned raisins. Put the 
mixture into a saucepan and simmer gently for fifteen minutes, or until the syrup is 
absorbed and the chutney is of the required consistence. Allow it to get cold, put it 
into bottles, cork down securely, and the chutney is then ready for use. 

Tomato Chutney. 

Pick and wipe on a cloth five pounds of ripe tomatoes, put them in an earthen- 
ware jar with one breakfast cupful of salt and one-half pint of vinegar, cover the jar 
to keep out the air, place it in a saucepan of boiling water and allow it to remain for 
six hours. Turn the contents of the jar out onto a sieve and pass it through taking 
care not to have any of the seeds or skin. Put two ounces each of shredded garlic 
and red peppers into a saucepan, add two ounces of ginger also cut up small 
and two pounds of sugar made into a syrup with one quart of vinegar; add the 
tomatoes and bring the whole gently to the boil. Remove the pan, let the chutney 
cool, put it into bottles, cork them down and stand them in a warm place until 
wanted. 

Extract of Garlic. 

Peel one teacupful of cloves of garlic, put them in a bottle, pour in half a pint of 
spirits of wine, and cork tightly. Shake the bottle occasionally for eight or ten days 
and the extract will then be fit for use. A very small quantity of the extract will be 
found sufficient for flavoring. 



PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 855 

Gherkins. 

Put some gherkins into a stone jar and cover them with strong brine adding a 
small piece of alum to prevent them losing color. When they have been soaking for 
seven or eight days take them out, put them into fresh water and leave them for two 
or three days in that. Boil some malt vinegar in a saucepan and let it get nearly 
cold. Take the gherkins out of the water and put them in a large pan, pour the cold 
vinegar over them, and they are ready for use. Cloves, allspice, cinnamon and mus- 
tard may be added to the vinegar before boiling, if desired. 

Herb Flavoring for Sauce, Soups and Stews. 

Remove all the stalks from one ounce of dried thyme, sweet basil, marjoram and 
bay-leaves, pound them in a mortar with one ounce each of grated nutmeg, ground 
mace, cloves, and white pepper. Pass the whole through a fine sieve, and bottle. 

Cucumber Catsup. 

Pound some cucumbers in a mortar; sprinkle with salt and leave them for several 
hours to extract the juice. Strain off the liquid by twisting in a towel, season well, 
and boil. Pour into bottles and cork tightly until wanted for use. 

Mushroom Catsup. 

Break up the required quantity of mushrooms, put them in a tub, salt over and 
leave for two days. Afterwards take out all the juice and strain into a saucepan; for 
every pint, put in one ounce of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper-corns, six cloves and 
a third of an ounce of ginger. When boiling, move the catsup to the side of the fire 
and let it simmer gently. 

Oyster Catsup. 

Pound two dozen oysters with three anchovies in a mortar and season with one- 
fourth ounce each of ground cloves, cayenne pepper and ground mace. Mix their 
liquor with them, turn them into a lined saucepan, pour in a pint of white wine and 
two wineglassfuls of brandy. Place the catsup over a slow fire until boiling, then 
strain it through a fine silk-sieve. When cold, pour the catsup into bottles and keep 
them tightly corked for use. 

Tomato Catsup. 

Cut a number of tomatoes into slices, put them in a deep earthenware pan in 
layers, sprinkle over a layer of salt and allow them to remain in the salt for twelve 
hours. Put them over the fire in a preserving-kettle and allow them to boil until

they are quite soft; then strain and squeeze the juice from them in a thin linen cloth. 
Put the strained juice over the fire with mace, cloves, grated horse-radish and garlic 
to taste and let it boil rapidly for thirty minutes or so. Remove it from the fire, 
allow it to get cold, then bottle it, corking the bottles well and dividing the spice 
equally among the bottles. The addition of a small quantity of salicylic acid will 
effectually prevent fermentation and mould. Eight grains stirred in after or while 
boiling will be sufficient for one quart. A piece of blotting-paper made to fit tightly 
over the catsup and saturated with a concentrated solution of salicylic acid in rum or 
brandy will help to keep it good. The acid is entirely harmless, with no taste or 
smell and can be obtained in powder or crystals, the latter being preferred. When 
this is used, care must be taken never to employ tin or metallic vessels as when it 
comes in contact with the metal it turns dark. Porcelain-lined vessels are the best. 



Walnut Catsup. 



Put one hundred green walnuts into a mortar and beat them well until bruised, 
then put hem into a jar with six ounces of chopped shallots, a head of garlic, one- 
half pound of salt, and two quarts of vinegar. Stir the contents of the jar twice a day 
for a fortnight, then strain off the vinegar, put it into a saucepan with three anchovies, 
one tablespoonful of cloves, two tablespoonfuls of peppercorns and one-fourth of an 
ounce of mace. Boil the vinegar for half an hour, then strain it off and leave it until 
cold. Pour the vinegar into bottles, being careful not to get any of the sediment 
mi-xed up in it. Cork the bottles tightly and keep them in a dry store-cupboard. 



Parsley Juice for Coloring. 



Put some leaves of parsley into a mortar to pound. Squeeze the juice off into a 
jar, stand the jar in a saucepan, surround it with boiling water, but do not let the 
water boil over the edges (a bain-marie is best), and keep it by the side of the fire 
till the juice is warm. It is then ready for use. 

Tomato Picalilli. 

Chop fine one-half bushel of tomatoes and squeeze them dry, put them into a 
large bowl, and mix in a couple of dozen minced onions, a dozen chopped green pep- 
pers, four ounces of mustard, a little less than a pint of salt, a large root of finely- 
grated horseradish, and four tablespoonfuls each of powdered cloves and allspice. 
When thoroughly macerated, put the mixture into a stone jar, pour over enough vine- 
gar to cover, making a slight hollow in the mixture to enable the liquor to get to the 
bottom of the jar, cover it well, and let it remain until the ingredients are thoroughly 
saturated. It is then ready for use.

Pickle of Brine. 

Pickle of brine is the name usually given in this country to the liquor in which 
substances used for food are soaked in order to give them certain flavors, or to assist 
in their preservation. These are commonly known to French cooks as marinades, 
under which heading some special recipes will be found. The butcher preserves meat 
in brine, which is described under that head. The preservation of vegetables and fruit 
is described under pickles, but the following recipes for the manufacture of pickling 
liquor used by cooks for various purposes will be found useful: 

(i.) FOR BEEF. Dissolve nine quarts of salt in eighteen gallons of water, and 
add two pounds of coarse brown sugar and eight ounces of saltpeter. Boil and skim 
well. Let the beef get thoroughly cold and firm after killing, and let as much of the 
blood as possible drain out before putting it in the pickle. The brine should be 
boiled up and skimmed occasionally, then it will last for many months, and suffice at 
one time to pickle about half an ordinary ox. 

(2.) FOR HAMS. For a large ham, allow eight ounces of bay salt, four ounces 
of common salt, and one ounce each of saltpeter and black pepper. Rub the ham 
well with this mixture every day for four days. At the end of that time pour eight 
ounces of treacle over the ham, rubbing it well in. Leave it for a month, rubbing 
and turning occasionally, after which soak the ham in cold water for twenty-four 
hours, then hang it up to dry. When cooked, the ham should be put in cold water 
and placed over a slow fire. 

(3.) FOR PORK. Put in a boiler as much water as will well cover the pork. 
When it boils, mix in salt by degrees. To ascertain whether there is salt enough in 
the water, put an egg in, and when it floats, there is sufficient. Pour the brine in an 
earthenware jar and let it cool. It is then ready to pour over the pork. 

(4.) FOR TONGUE. Crush eight ounces of common salt with two ounces of 
saltpeter, and mix them with one pound of treacle. When the tongue is prepared, 
rub it over with the above mixture. It should be kept in pickle for a fortnight, being 
turned and well rubbed occasionally. 

(5.) FOR MACKEREL. For one pint of vinegar allow one-third teacupful of 
beer, three bay leaves, one-half ounce of ground allspice, one-fourth ounce each of 
salt and pepper, and one-third teaspoonful of cayenne pepper. Mix all these ingre- 
dients together, and pour them over the fish. A sufficient quantity of pickle should 
be made to cover the fish completely. 

(6.) FOR SALMON. Mix with one quart of the cooking liquor of the fish three 
gills of vinegar, four blades of mace, four bay leaves, three pieces of whole ginger, 
one-fourth ounce each of black pepper and allspice, and a little salt. Boil the liquor 
for half an hour, then pour it over the fish, which should be laid in a deep dish or jar, 
and cover it with another dish to keep the air out. 



858 PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 

Pickled Beet-Roots. 

Slice and cut into squares as many cold cooked beet-roots as needed and place 
them in wide-mouthed pickle bottles; boil enough vinegar to cover them, a blade of 
mace, half an ounce of ginger root and a little scraped horseradish to each pint; pour 
in while hot and cork and tie down with wet bladder while cooling. 

Pickled Red Cabbage. 

Take three red cabbages, trim them and remove the stalks; cut them into thin 
slices and lay on a dish and cover with salt, leaving them there for twelve hours; at 
the expiration of which time wash and salt off the cabbage, draining well, and place 
in a stone jar, mixing in some thyme, mint and parsley and peppercorns; pour in 
enough strong white vinegar to cover, place the lid on the jar and let it remain there 
for four weeks, when it is ready for use. 

Pickled White Cabbage. 

Take four large cabbages and remove all tough portions and the stalks, cut them 
into slices, put them in an earthen jar or wooden tub, sprinkle over a half pint of salt 
and allow it to stand over night. The next day draw off the brine, put the cabbage 
over the fire, with four peeled and chopped onions, four ounces of mustard seed, two 
ounces each of ground mustard-seed, celery-seed and turmeric, one ounce each of 
whole mace, cloves, allspice and pepper, two pounds of brown sugar and enough vin- 
egar to cover the whole. Boil well until the stalks of the cabbage are tender, then 
cool and pickle, keeping in air-tight jars. 

Pickled Cauliflowers. 

Take two cauliflowers which have been cut up, one pint of small onions and 
three medium-sized red peppercorns; dissolve one-half pint of salt in water enough to 
cover the vegetables, and after allowing them to stand in this all night drain off the 
water. Boil two quarts of vinegar with four tablespoonfuls of mustard and three 
tablespoonfuls of turmeric, then put in the vegetables and boil for fifteen or twenty 
minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender. Put the cauliflower into wide-mouthed 
bottles or jars and pour the hot vinegar over them. 



Pickled Celery. 



Cut the stalks from three heads of celery into equal lengths; wash these 
thoroughly in plenty of water, put them in a bowl, cover them with brine sufficiently 
strong to bear an egg, and leave them for a week or ten days. At the end of that 



PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 859 

time refresh the celery by placing it in plenty of clean cold water, and set it on a 
sieve where it may remain until it is dry. Boil enough vinegar to cover the spices 
with any kind that may be desired. Place the celery in a jar, pour over it the boiling 
vinegar, and leave it until the vinegar is cold; then cover the top of the jar with 
stout brown paper, and tie it down tightly. Place it in a dry cupboard, and use it as 
required. 

Pickled Corn. 

Pluck the corn while still unripe and about the size of the little finger. Peel off 
the leaves, and lay the ears in a pickle-jar, with a few small pieces of basilicum and 
a few bay-leaves mixed with them. Put enough vinegar in a saucepan over the fire 
to cover, and when boiling pour it over the corn. When the vinegar has cooled tie 
a piece of wet parchment or thick paper over the top of the jar, and leave for a fort- 
night or so before using the pickle. 

Pickled Cucumbers. 

Select two or three dozen large cucumbers, cut a piece out of the sides and scoop 
out the seeds with a spoon. Care should be taken that the cucumbers be not over- 
ripe or yellow at the ends. Place in a vessel of salted water, and let them remain 
for nine days, or until they become yellow, stirring them up every two or three days, 
then take them out, put into a saucepan with a good supply of vine leaves, both 
under and over, pour in the brine in which they were soaked, place the saucepan 
over the fire and boil slowly for about five hours, take them out and drain dry. 
Stuff the cavity of each with a little horseradish, garlic, capsicum, mustard seed 
and peppercorns, care being taken to keep each ingredient as separate as possible 
without mixing; continue in layers until the cavity is filled up, then place in its 
proper position the piece that was cut out, and sew it up. Then into a saucepan 
pour one gallon or so of vinegar, enough to cover the cucumbers; add to each gallon 
one ounce each of cloves and mace, two ounces each of long pepper, ginger in slices, 
and Jamaica pepper, and three ounces of mustard seed, all tied in a muslin bag; also 
add a root of a horseradish cut lengthwise into strips, and a quarter of a pound of 
cloves of garlic. Place the saucepan on the fire and boil for about five minutes; re- 
move the bag of spice, pour the whole over the cucumbers in jars sufficient to cover 
them, tie them over securely and let them remain for five or six days, when they will 
be ready for service. 

Pickled Cucumbers (Like Mango Pickles). 

Take young, but fully grown, cucumbers, cut a small piece out of the side of 
each and scoop out the seeds, cover with salt and let stand for one night. Cut up 
into small pieces an equal quantity of horseradish, shallots and caper; mix them to- 
gether with quarter their bulk of mustard seeds, the third of a grated nutmeg, one 



86o PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 

teaspoonful of bruised cloves and a small quantity of white pepper. On the follow- 
ing day dry the cucumbers on a cloth and stuff with the above mixture. Fix the 
pieces that were taken out of the sides in their places and bind them with twine to 
keep them in position. Put in large jars, packing them closely together, and pour 
over enough vinegar to cover them. Tie a piece of strong paper over each jar and 
put in a cool, dry place till wanted. 

Pickled Eggs. 

Put twenty eggs into a net, then into a saucepan with more than enough boiling 
water to cover them, and boil for thirty minutes; then plunge them into cold water, 
remove the shells, and put them into a jar. Pour six breakfast cupfuls of brown 
vinegar into a saucepan; add half an ounce each of bruised mace, white ginger, cori- 
ander seeds, cardamons and cloves, and ten chillies, also one ounce of sugar, and boil 
for a few minutes. Let the pickle get cold, pour it over the eggs, and cover over. 

Pickled Garlic. 

Take one pound of garlic, remove the skin, divide them into cloves, put them on 
a flat dish or board and sprinkle over with salt. Let them remain for two or three 
days, then wipe and put them in the open air to dry. Put one ounce each of pepper- 
corns and bruised mustard seeds into a saucepan with one quart more of vinegar and 
add a little salt, set the pan on the fire, boil, skim well and plunge the garlic in, 
taking care that it is entirely covered with the vinegar. Let it remain in for three 
minutes, allow the liquor to cool, and put it in a large jar. Tie the jar down securely 
with skin or wet parchment, and it can then be stored for use. 

Pickled Lemons. 

Wipe two dozen or so of lemons, rub them well with salt, put them in a bowl, 
cover with more salt, and allow them to remain for four or five days, turning occa- 
sionally. Take them out to dry on a sieve in the sun, and pack in jars, sprinkling 
over evenly two ounces each of bruised white ginger and white peppers, one-fourth 
ounce red peppers, and one-half ounce each of coriander and mustard seeds. Pour 
over enough vinegar to cover, let them remain .for three weeks, then add enough 
vinegar to make up for the quantity absorbed, tie down, and the pickle will be ready 
for use in six weeks, though if left for six months it will be much better. 



Pickled Mangoes. 



Remove the peel from as many mangoes as may be required, cut them into 
halves to remove the stones, rub well with salt, and put them in the sun for two or 
three days Wipe well, and stuff each with a mixture of two cloves of garlic, two 



PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 861 

cloves, one stick of cinnamon, a few slices of green ginger and green peppers, and a 
few onion seeds pounded together in a mortar; fasten the heads together with thin 
thread or cotton, put them into wide-mouthed bottles, pour over sufficient vinegar to 
cover, cork down tightly, and stand them in the sun for about twenty days. One or 
two tablespoonfuls of mustard oil, if poured over the pickle before adding the vinegar, 
will prevent its spoiling. The pickle will not be ready for use until it has been in the 
bottles for two or three months, or possibly four months. 

Pickled Mushrooms. 

Secure sufficient small fresh mushrooms, cut the stalks off short and remove 
the skins with a piece of flannel dipped in salt. Place them in a stewpan together 
with one teaspoonful of pounded mace and one-half teaspoonful of ground pepper for 
each pint, dredge with salt and toss over a moderate fire. After the juice has run 
from them, and has all dried up, pour in enough vinegar to cover; boil for about 
three minutes, then turn all into jars or wide-mouthed bottles. On the day follow- 
ing, cover the jars or bottles with parchment, tie down securely, see that they are 
perfectly air-tight and stow them away in a dry cupboard for future use. 

Pickled Onions. 

Put the desired quantity of small onions into hot water and then peel them; 
place them in fresh salted water with a small piece of alum in it, and leave them until 
the following day; drain off the water, add more fresh water with more salt and alum 
and leave them a day longer. Afterwards drain and put them into jars, placing in each 
jar one or two blades of mace, one or two red-peppers, a few white peppercorns and 
a small quantity of horseradish. Pour in sufficient vinegar to cover the onions well, 
cork the jars, cover with parchment, tie them down and keep in a dry store-cup- 
board. In a month they will be ready for use. 

Pickled Onions and Cucumbers. 

Peel twelve cucumbers and three large onions, cut them all into thick slices and 
sprinkle over with salt. Leave them thus for a day, then drain well, put them in a stone- 
jar, pour over sufficient boiling vinegar to cover and keep them in a warm place for 
a day. Drain off the vinegar again and repeat the process till both the onions and 
cucumbers are quite green, adding a little pepper and ginger, the last time of boiling. 
Tie down and pack away in a cool place. 



Pickled Spanish Onions. 



Peel some onions, cut a small round piece out of the bottom of each and 
scoop out a little of the inside. Put them in a vessel with salt and water to cover 



862 PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 

and let them remain for two or three days, changing the water two or three times. 
Afterwards drain and stuff the onions as follows: First put in a little ground mustard- 
seed, then some ginger with a little mace and shallot, add more mustard and fill up 
with grated horseradish. Replace the bottom pieces and bind the onions round 
with string to keep them in place. Make a strong pickle of white vinegar, mace, 
ginger, nutmeg, sliced horseradish and a little salt; put in the onions and let them 
boil up three times care being taken that they do not boil too much, for in that 
case they would lose their firmness and would not keep. Put them with the 
pickle into jars, leave them till the following day, then strain off the liquor, boil 
it up and pour it over the onions again. When the pickle is cold, tie the jars 
over first with wet bladder, and then with leather and keep them in a cool dry 
store-cupboard for use. 

Pickled Oysters. 

Thoroughly cleanse and beard four dozen oysters, put them into a saucepan, 
strain their liquor over them, season well with salt, allspice, cloves, and mace, and 
boil for a few minutes. When plump pour one-half pint of vinegar over the oysters, 
boil them up again, turn them into earthenware jars, and leave until cold ; then cover 
over each jar with stout paper, tie down, and put them in a dry cupboard for use. 

Pickled Tomatoes. 

Put enough vinegar to cover a peck of tomatoes into a saucepan with one ounce 
each of black pepper and cloves, and two ounces of mustard seed. Prick one peck of 
tomatoes all over, and let so much of the juice as possible run into the saucepan with 
the vinegar ; boil well, stirring often, and allow the liquor to get quite cold. Put the 
tomatoes in layers in a deep pan with salt sprinkled over them, and at the end of 
three days wash off all the salt. Put them back into the deep pan or jar, pour over 
the vinegar taking care that it is quite cold, cover, and in the course of ten or twelve 
days the pickle will be ready for use. 

French Pickles. 

Slice one peck of green tomatoes, cover them plentifully with salt, and leave them 
for one night. Cut one-fourth peck of onions into slices, and put a thick layer of them 
in a metal kettle; then put in a layer of the tomatoes, a layer of onions, and so on until 
all are used. Sprinkle between each layer some of the following spices: Four ounces 
of white mustard seed, one ounce each of cloves, allspice, and celery seed, one table- 
spoonful of cayenne pepper, one pound of brown sugar, and four tablespoonfuls of 
mixed mustard. Cover the above ingredients with vinegar and boil them well for one 
hour. At the end of that time pack the pickles in jars, and pour the vinegar over them. 
When cold, tie some stout paper over the jars, and keep in a dry store-cupboard. 



PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 863 

Green Pickles. 

Make a brine of salt and water strong enough to float a fresh egg, and put in it 
the vegetables to be pickled, green tomatoes, gherkins, snap beans, cucumbers, etc., 
and let them remain in it for a fortnight (a longer time will not hurt them). They must 
be well covered with grape leaves, and sufficient weight must be put on them to keep 
them well down under the brine. When the vegetables are taken out of this brine 
they must be steeped in weak vinegar for several days, then put over the fire in two 
quarts of strong vinegar (which quantity will be sufficient for four quarts of vegeta- 
bles), two ounces of long pepper, two ounces of mustard-seed, one ounce of celery- 
seed, one-half an ounce each of cloves and mace, three red pepper pods, one table- 
spoonful of grated horseradish, and sugar to taste; when this boils have the pickles 
drained from the weak vinegar and put into jars, and pour the vinegar over them 
boiling hot. 

Mixed Pickles. 

Mix in equal quantities some small cucumbers, sliced green tomatoes, cauliflower 
picked into small flowerets and small button-onions. Put them in a large vessel, cover 
with strongly-salted water and let them steep for twenty-four hours. Then drain the 
brine from the pickles, scald it and dissolve in it a piece of alum the size of a nutmeg. 
Pour the boiling brine over the pickles. When cold strain the brine off and prepare 
as many quarts of vinegar as there are quarts of brine. To each quart of vinegar 
allow one breakfast cupful of brown sugar, one teacupful of flour and four ounces of 
ground mustard. Boil the sugar and vinegar. Mix the flour and mustard smooth 
with a very little water, then stir the boiling vinegar gradually into it. When quite 
smooth pour it over the pickles. When cold tie stout paper over the jar. 

Mustard Pickles. 

This name is given to a variety of pickles containing mustard. Several recipes 
of this kind will be found among those here given. 

Piccalilli. 

Bruise four ounces of mustard-seed, put it into a saucepan with three pints of 
vinegar and boil it, remove from the fire and let it get cold. Cut four ounces of 
ginger into slices, separate four ounces of garlic into cloves, put them into a jar with 
one-half ounce each of turmeric and whole pepper and a little saffron. Strain the 
vinegar, boil it up again and pour it while boiling over the contents of the jar, then 
cover the jar close and leave it till the vinegar is cold. Prepare whatever vegetables 
may have been selected for the pickle, wash them well, rub them over with salt and 
dry them in the sun for a day or two. When ready put the vegetables in the vinegar, 



864 PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 

cover and tie the jar over with parchment and put it in a dry store-cupboard. In 
about six weeks the pickles will be ready for use. 

Green Nectarine Pickles. 

Put a thin layer of salt on a dish, over this put a layer of green nectarines, then 
salt and more fruit, and continue in this way until as much fruit is used as is desired. 
Cover over with a thick coating of salt and let it remain for four or five days. Care- 
fully take out the fruit, wipe dry and place in the sun for two or three days, turning 
frequently; then pack away in jars. Have ready a mixture sufficient to cover the 
fruit composed of one ounce each of white ginger, red peppers, allspice and cloves, 
one-half ounce of sugar, one shallot and six green peppers to each quart of vinegar. 
Let the vinegar boil for ten to fifteen minutes, remove from the fire, add and dissolve 
in it a very small quantity of alum, which will help to make the fruit crisp; when 
cold pour this over the fruit, then cover the jars and put away for use. 

Spanish Pickles. 

Pull in pieces the flower of a small head of cauliflower and cut in pieces about 
one inch long eighteen large white cucumbers. If the cucumbers are fresh let them 
steep in brine for twenty-four hours; but if they have been kept in brine soak 
them for three days in pure cold water before cutting them up. Put the pieces 
of cucumber and cauliflower over the fire, cover with water, add a little salt and let 
them simmer gently for twenty minutes. Cut twelve small onions in quarters, put 
them in a little fresh milk and water over the fire, add a little salt and let them cook 
,till just tender, but not soft. Steep four green peppers in weak brine for twelve or 
fourteen hours. Let all drain till next day, then put them into a pan with one-half 
ounce each of light-colored turmeric, celery seed rolled and white mustard, two ounces 
of the best English table-mustard and one saltspoonful of prepared corn starch, 
blended with a little vinegar and eight ounces of loaf sugar. Add sufficient vinegar 
to cover and let it boil till it begins to thicken. Let it cool a little and then put 
it in glass jars with glass tops. 

Green Tomato Pickles. 

Select fully-grown green tomatoes just before they begin to open, slice them and 
put them in layers in large jars, strewing plenty of salt over each layer. Allow them 
to remain for ten or twelve hours, then put them in a preserving-pan, adding for 
every five pounds of tomatoes one pound of brown sugar, one-half pound of sliced 
small onions, two sliced green pepper pods, one teaspoonful each of peppercorns and 
cloves, half a stick of cinnamon and one-fourth teaspoonful each of cayenne pepper, 
also one quart of vinegar. Drain the tomatoes, put them in with the above ingre- 



PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 865 

clients and allow the whole to simmer gently at the side of the fire. When the toma- 
toes are tender turn them with the pickling ingredients into jars, leave them cold, and 
then paste stout paper over the top of each jar. The pickle will be better preserved 
if the jars are small. Pack them away for use in a cool, dry store-cupboard. This 
forms an excellent relish for cold meat or cheese. 

Walnut Pickles. 

Put a quantity of the green rinds or outer shells of ripe walnuts into a tub that 
has a tap, sprinkle them with water and prop the tub up on the side opposite to the 
tap. Place a vessel under the tap to receive the liquor which will soon begin to drip 
from it. When a sufficient quantity has passed through add to one gallon of it a 
stick of horseradish, a bunch of sweet herbs, a couple of bay leaves, a good-sized 
onion, one-fourth of an ounce each of bruised ginger, allspice and black pepper and 
two heaping tablespoonfuls of salt. Put it over the fire and let it simmer for twenty 
minutes; strain and allow it to stand until cold. Then stir it up and put it into bot- 
tles, placing an equal quantity of the spices that were boiled in it into each bottle 
and corking them well. 

Potato Yeast. 

Have in readiness a kettle containing three quarts of boiling water; peel and 
thoroughly wash three large potatoes and place them into a basin to soak. Next 
put half a teacupful of flour into a bowl with an equal amount of sugar and a table- 
spoonful of salt; over these grate the potatoes quickly and stir the whole well with a 
wooden spoon so that it will not become of a dark color, which it will attain if not 
done very quickly. Pour a pint of the boiling water over the grater into the bowl, 
stirring it into the. mixture, and add enough more of the boiling water to make the 
mixture of the consistency of thin starch. Should the preparation refuse to thicken 
put in a double boiler over the fire and stir it constantly until it does thicken; then 
pour it through a fine sieve into a bowl and let it cool. When lukewarm all through 
stir in a breakfast cupful of yeast, place a light covering over the bowl and set in a 
warm but not hot place and let it remain there until it is light and covered with a 
white foam. When it commences to rise beat it well and when it has thoroughly 
risen pour it off into wide-mouthed earthen jars, let it remain for twelve hours, then 
cover the jars over tightly and put in a cool place. Half a pint or so of the yeast 
should be put into a glass jar for making the succeeding lot of potato yeast. The 
jars should always be well shaken before the yeast is used and should be kept in a 
cool place. 

Preserved Green-Corn. 

Select very full ears of tender corn, remove the husk and silks, cut the corn 
from the cob with the back of a knife, pack it in glass jars, filling them and pressing 



866 PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 

the corn down, and then close them with rubber and porcelain-lined covers. Place 
some laths across the bottom of a large boiler, and fill it with jars of corn, laying a 
little straw or hay against each to prevent them from knocking against one another 
during the boiling. Pour in sufficient cold water to cover the jars to half their 
height, place the boiler over the fire with a cloth, and the cover over it, and boil the 
corn continually for three hours, being careful to see that there is water enough to 
furnish a full volume of steam. Take up the jars and screw the covers as tightly as 
possible. When the jars are cold again screw the covers, and keep the corn in a cool, 
dark place. 

Mango, Preserved. 

Put a hundred or so medium-sized green mangoes into a bowl of cold water to 
steep; grate off the outer coat very fine, cut them lengthwise in order to remove 
the stones, and throw them into weak lime-water. Put them into a preserving-pan 
with enough water to cover, parboil, skimming frequently; then turn them out onto a 
sieve and drain. Have ready a sufficient quantity of syrup, made of eight pounds of 
sugar, put in the mangoes and let them simmer in this, removing all the scum, until 
the sugar commences to crystallize; then remove the pan from the fire, allow the con- 
tents to cool, put the mangoes and syrup into wide-mouthed bottles or jars, and cork 
down when quite cold. Let them remain for two or three days, and should the syrup 
be getting thin, reboil it, adding the mangoes for a few minutes at the end of the 
boiling, and bottling again. This process should be repeated until there is no further 
sign of fermentation, corking down when quite cold. This preserve will remain good 
for a number of years if kept in a cool dry place. Enough syrup should be prepared 
at first, so that on the completion of the boiling there will be enough to cover the 
mangoes. 

Preserved Mushrooms. 

Choose the largest button-mushrooms and wash them in vinegar, place them on 
a fine sieve, sprinkle with a small quantity of salt, and allow them to drain. Then 
place them in a deep dish in a cool oven, and in about an hour's time drain them 
again. Pour all the juice that ran from them into a lined stewpan, mix with a blade 
or two of mace, and then boil until reduced to half its original quantity; move it from 
the fire and let it get cold. Put the mushrooms into large earthenware jars, and pour 
the cold liquor over them. Melt some suet in a stewpan, and pour a layer of it on 
each jar; when cold and hardened cover the jars with bladder, tie them down, and 
keep them in a dry store-cupboard. 

Preserved Parsley for Winter Use. 

Tie some fresh-washed parsley in bunches, having first carefully picked it over, 
put it in a saucepan of boiling water with a little salt and boil for three or four min- 



PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 867 

utes; then place on a sieve to drain. Dry it slowly in front of a brisk fire, and when 
sufficiently so to almost crumble, put it into bottles. When the parsley is required 
for use, soak it in warm water for two or three minutes. Although not equal to fresh 
parsley, it answers very well when the other cannot be procured. 

Preserved Tomatoes. 

Procure eight pounds of perfectly sound green tomatoes and put them in a pre- 
serving-pan with the thinly-pared rind and strained juice of four or five lemons and 
two ounces of whole ginger. Place them over a brisk fire until tender, then put in 
eight pounds of coarsely-crushed loaf sugar and boil the whole quickly until thickly 
reduced, stirring it frequently and keeping it well-skimmed. When the preserve is 
sufficiently cooked, remove the ginger, turn it into jars, and when cold, tie over 
tightly for future use. 

Preserved Truffles. 

Wash well and scrub the required number or quantity of truffles which should be 
quite black and freshly gathered, peel them carefully rather thin, pack them closely 
in bottles, cork them tightly, place them in the bain-marie or in a saucepan of water 
and cook them gently for an hour or so. Allow the bottles to cool before taking 
them out; put them in a dry place and the truffles will remain good for a long time. 

Removing Salt from Butter. 

Place three or four pounds of salted butter in a bowl, pouring over it sufficient 
water to cover and beat until the water is slightly colored; then pour off the water 
and add some more and keep on in this manner until the water remains quite clear 
after the beating. 

Aristocratic Sauce. 

Mix one pound of anchovies, and about one-half teaspoonful each of cloves, 
mace and Jamaica ginger with one pint of juice that has been pressed from some 
green walnuts and permitted to settle, put them into a saucepan, and boil them until 
the anchovies are dissolved, strain the boiled liquor into another saucepan, add six 
shallots, two tablespoonfuls of soy, one breakfast cupful of vinegar, and one-half 
breakfast cupful of port wine. When boiled, leave the sauce until cold, then put it 
into bottles, and keep it corked until wanted for serving. 

Cardinal Fish Sauce. 

Mix together one pint of vinegar, one gill of port wine, one tablespoonful of 
anchovy liquor, one dessert spoonful of walnut catsup, one-fourth ounce of cayenne, 
two drams of cochineal and three cloves of garlic. Let it stand for four days, giving 



868 PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 

it about six good stirrings during that time. Strain it through a flannel bag, and put 
it in small bottles. 

Chef Sauce for Steaks, Etc. 

Peel six shallots, cut them into halves, put them in a wide-mouthed bottle, with 
one-half ounce of cayenne pepper, and four tablespoonfuls of soy; pour in one break- 
fast cupful of mushroom catsup, shake the contents of the bottle well, and fill it up 
with the best vinegar. Shake the bottle occasionally for two days, then leave it un- 
touched for four days longer. Pour off one-half pint of the sauce into a smaller 
bottle, which keep corked for present use; fill up the larger bottle again with more 
vinegar, cork it tightly, and leave it for about a month before using the sauce. 

Gourmet's Sauce. 

Macerate together for two or three weeks two quarts of good mushroom catsup, 
one quart each of walnut catsup and port wine, one-half pint each of chili vinegar 
and soy, one breakfast cupful of essence of anchovies, four ounces each of bruised 
garlic and white pepper, one ounce of bruised chillies, and one ounce each of mace 
and cloves. Strain through a coarse muslin, and bottle for future use. This sauce 
is improved by keeping. 

Governor's Sauce. 

Cut one-half peck of green tomatoes in slices, lay them in a deep dish, strew 
over them three or four tablespoonfuls of salt and leave them for one day. Then 
drain them free from their liquor, lay them in a saucepan with three or four chillies 
either green or red, three finely-chopped onions, one tablespoonful of grated horse- 
radish, two ounces of brown sugar, one-fourth ounce each of cloves and allspice and 
one-half teaspoonful each of white and cayenne pepper. Pour in sufficient quan- 
tity of vinegar to cover them and cook them over a slow fire. When the toma- 
toes are soft turn them with the vinegar and other ingredients in small stone or 
earthenware jars and leave them till cold; then close the jars well, sealing them 
air-tight, and pack them away for use. 

Harvey Sauce. 

Prepare twelve fluid-ounces of sauce made with mushroom and walnut cat- 
sup, garlic, soy and sprats, using in proportion one-half gallon each of the cat- 
sup to one-half pint of soy, four ounces of garlic and one and one-half pounds 
of sprats, and boiling these together for fifteen minutes and straining. Put this 
in a saucepan with a little more soy and one teaspoonful of cayenne and stir 
over the fire till warm. 



PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 869 

Hot Sauce. 

Scald ripe, sound tomatoes, peel and weigh them; to five pounds add one 
pound of onions peeled and sliced, five ounces of fresh red peppers, weighed after the 
seeds are taken out and then chopped fine, four ounces of brown sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of salt and one pint of vinegar. Put all these ingredients over the fire in a 
porcelain-lined pan and boil slowly, stirring frequently to prevent burning, and after 
the sauce begins to boil it must be stirred almost incessantly. It should be boiled 
until it is about the consistency of apple sauce. When it has cooked enough remove 
the pan from the fire, let the sauce cool in it, then bottle it and cork the bottles tight. 

Worcestershire Sauce. 

Dissolve three ounces of sugar in one pint of vinegar over the fire, then take it 
off and mix in two tablespoonfuls each of Indian soy and walnut catsup, one-half 
tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, one nutmeg cut in thin 
slices, twelve cloves, one-half tablespoonful of ground ginger, three or four cloves of 
garlic and a small piece of lemon peel. Turn all the ingredients into a wide-mouthed 
bottle and let it stand for a month, shaking it well every day. Strain off the sauce 
into smaller bottles and keep them tightly corked till required. 

French Spice. 

Mix together one-half ounce of thyme and bay-leaves, and one-fourth ounce each 
of marjoram and rosemary ; place the herbs on a sheet of paper, in a slow oven. 
When very dry put the herbs in a mortar with one ounce of nutmeg and one ounce of 
cloves, one-half ounce of peppercorns, and one-fourth ounce of cayenne pepper; and 
pound all until very fine, then sift it through a fine hair-sieve. Put the spice into 
bottles, cork well, and keep them in a dry store-cupboard for use. 

French Sausage Spice. 

Mix together in a mortar five pounds of ground black pepper, two and one-half 
pounds of ground ginger, one pound each of ground nutmegs and cloves and one-half 
pound each of ground anise-seed and coriander-seeds. Preserve in a well-corked 
bottle. 

Kitchen Spice. 

Mix together two pounds of ground black, pepper, one pound of ground ginger, 
four ounces each of ground allspice, nutmegs and cinnamon, one-half ounce of ground 
cloves and three pounds of salt. This is very nice for seasoning sauces, soups and 
gravies, and should be preserved in a tightly-corked bottle. 



8 7 o PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 

Mixed Spice. 

Pound two ounces each of allspice, cloves and cinnamon, one-half ounce each of 
ginger and nutmeg and two ounces of coriander-seeds. When well powdered they 
must be kept in a tightly-corked bottle. 

Savory Spice. 

Mix together equal parts of cloves, mace, nutmeg, pepper and salt, all finely 
ground beforehand. Put in a well corked bottle. 

Spiced Tomatoes. 

For two pounds of ripe tomatoes allow one pound of brown sugar, one-half pint 
of cider vinegar and one-fourth of an ounce each of cinnamon and cloves. Put all 
these ingredients into a pan and allow them to simmer slowly at the side of the fire 
until the tomatoes are cooked. When ready take the tomatoes out and put them on 
a dish, leaving the syrup to go on simmering. When the tomatoes are quite cold 
return them to the syrup and boil gently for ten minutes longer. Afterwards put 
them in jars, allow the syrup to keep on boiling until well reduced, then move it from 
the fire and let it get cold. Pour the cold syrup over the tomatoes, cover the jars 
with parchment, tie them down tightly and keep them in a dry store-cupboard. 

Tomato Paste. 

Secure some ripe tomatoes, cut them into quarters and place them in a stewpan 
with two or three cloves of garlic, a handful of basil and a lump of salt; pour in just 
enough water to keep them from burning, and stew gently. When cooked turn the 
tomatoes onto a fine hair-sieve, leave them until all the water has run from them, 
then pass their pulp through the sieve into a lined saucepan. Season the pulp to 
taste with pepper and boil it until reduced to a thick paste. It must be stirred con- 
stantly with a wooden spoon. When ready turn the paste into small jars, allow it to 
cool, then tie them over with heavy paper and put them away for future use. This 
paste makes a very good sauce, and in Italy, where it is used much, it is called 
conserva. 

Celery Vinegar. 

Pour over one ounce of celery-seeds one quart of the best vinegar, having the 
celery-seeds dried and pounded, and let them steep in it for ten days, shaking it 
every day; then strain and pour into small bottles. It is very good for flavoring. 



PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 871 

Fine Herbs Vinegar. 

Take equal quantities of tarragon, burnet, chervil and cress, all of which 
should have been gathered the day before. Fill a wide-mouthed bottle or jar with 
this, adding also two cloves of garlic and a green pepper. Cover the whole with 
vinegar, cork the bottle tightly, and place it in a warm temperature for a fortnight. 
Strain the vinegar through a fine hair-sieve, pressing the herbs well. Then filter 
through paper until quite clear. Pour into bottles and keep tightly corked. 

Garlic Vinegar. 

Peel and chop three-quarters of an ounce of garlic, pound three cloves and grate 
half a nutmeg; put them all into a bottle, pour over a pint of vinegar, cork the bot- 
tle, shake it every day for a week, strain and put into small bottles, and cork securely. 

Horseradish Vinegar. 

Put three ounces of finely-chopped horseradish into a jar or a bottle, add one 
drachm of cayenne, one ounce of bruised onions, a small quantity of black pepper and 
celery-seeds, pour over one quart of vinegar, let remain for fourteen days, then filter 
off all the liquor, put it in bottles, cork them down, and the vinegar is ready for use. 
This can be employed to advantage in mixing mustard, or as a relish for cold meats, 
salads, etc. 

Tarragon Vinegar. 

Gather the shoots of tender tarragon the day before they are wanted. Put into 
a gallon jar as many as they will hold without pressing them down, add the thinly- 
pared rind of two lemons, also half a dozen cloves, fill the jar with white wine vine- 
gar, cork it tightly, and allow it to stand in the sun for two or three weeks. Strain 
the vinegar through a cloth, squeezing the tarragon leaves well, and wringing them in 
the cloth, filter it through paper, and then bottle it. 

Tomato Vinegar. 

Cut three dozen large, ripe tomatoes into quarters, but do not separate them; rub 
one-half pound of salt over, put them into a large jar, and set it in a cool oven, or by 
the side of the fire for a day or two. Then put in one-half pint of mustard seed, a 
sliced clove of garlic, and a little each of cloves, mace and grated nutmeg. Pour 
over them two quarts of boiling vinegar, tie a piece of parchment or bladder over the 
jar, and keep it in a warm place for six days, shaking it well every day Afterwards 
place the jar in a dry store-cupboard for two or three weeks; then strain the liquor, 
and when clear put it into small bottles and keep them tightly corked. 



872 PICKLES AND CONDIMENTS. 

Walnut Vinegar. 

Prepare some brine sufficiently strong to float an egg, then put some green wal- 
nut shells in it, and allow them to soak for fourteen days. At the end of that time 
drain the shells, and leave them in the sun for nine days. Place the shells in a large 
stone jar, cover them well with boiling vinegar, and leave them for a week. Drain 
the vinegar off the shells, boil it up again, and pour it over the shells. Keep the jar 
closely covered until ready to use the vinegar. 



Cheese and Fruits. 

Brie Cheese. 

This is a large, flat, soft, round cheese, from three-fourths of an inch to one inch 
thick, and ten to twelve inches in diameter, made in the district of Brie, about twenty- 
five miles from Paris. It is the most popular Parisian cheese, many millions being 
sold in that city every year. Brie is made from new milk, though a cheese termed 
" faxjon Brie" is made from partially skimmed milk. When sufficiently firm to be re- 
moved from the mould the cheese is placed in a separate apartment until, after turn- 
ing daily, it is covered with a white mould; it then is placed in another apartment to 
take the blue and red mould the latter, however, which improves the flavor, is not to 
be had in all dairies. One gallon of rich milk makes a large cheese. Brie is ready 
to eat in about six weeks. 

Camembert Cheese. 

Next to Brie, this is the most popular French cheese. It is small and round, 
and weighs about eleven ounces, and is covered with blue mould on the top of a white 
one. Camembert is chiefly made in the Calvados, in Normandy, which is the center 
of a large and important industry. The milk is placed warm in wooden tubs pro- 
vided with lids, brought to a curd in two and one-half hours, removed by the help of 
large ladles into the metal moulds, about five inches high by four inches in diameter, 
and turned in from six to eight hours, then turned again the following day, and finally 
removed, the curd being meanwhile upon straw or rush mats. When firm enough the 
cheeses are salted in the hand, turned daily on shelves until covered with white mold, 
removed to another apartment to take the blue mold, where they are ripened and 
ready for use in from five to six weeks. Temperature and humidity, as effecting the 
growth of the fungi, are all important in the manufacture of this cheese. 

\ 

Cheddar Cheese 

Is one of the very finest of cheeses. It is pale in color, mellow, and when good 
resembles a hazelnut in flavor. The cheddar principle pervades the entire cheese- 
making districts of America, Canada and New Zealand, but no cheese imported by 
us can equal the cheddars of Somerset and the West of Scotland. Cheddar cheeses 
are made from 100 to 150 pounds in weight, but the Wilts loaf and the West 
Gloucester cheeses of England are made upon a principle closely resembling the 

873 



874 CHEESE AND FRUITS. 

cheddar. The curd is brought in an hour at from eighty to eighty-five degrees Fahren- 
heit, broken down, gently heated by the addition of hot whey until the curd has 
become firm and shotty. The whey is then removed, the curd pressed, cut up, piled, 
aired to induce the formation of acid, again cut, salted, ground and vatted. It is 
then pressed and finally removed to the curing-room, where it remains at a tempera- 
ture of from sixty-five to seventy degrees Fahrenheit, and is regularly turned until it 
is ripe. 

Cottage Cheese. 

Pour some boiling water into a pan of clotted sour milk. Stir, turn it into a 
colander, pour a little cold water over it, salt and break it up. A richer way is to 
put equal parts of buttermilk and thick milk into a kettle together over the fire, heat 
it until nearly ready to boil, pour into a linen bag and let it drain until the next day. 
Then remove, salt and put in a little cream or butter, according to whether it is thick 
or not, and make up into balls the size of an orange. 

Cream Cheeses. 

Are made from new milk, milk and cream mixed in varying proportions, and even 
"strippings," the last of the milk drawn from the cow at each milking, and less 
creamy than the first; but the genuine cream cheese, made from pure cream, cannot 
be compared to these weaker substitutes. 

Dutch Cream Cheese. 

Put the yolks of five eggs into a basin with three whole eggs and beat well, then 
mix with them one pint of buttermilk. Take three quarts of milk fresh from the 
cow, pour it into a saucepan, and place it over the fire until boiling, then mix in the 
above mixture. Boil up once, remove from the fire, cover, and let it stand until the 
curd has formed. Turn the curd into a fine hair-sieve, put a weight on top, and leave 
it thus for twenty-four hours. Serve the cheese with cream and sugar. 

Gorgonzola Cheese. 

For one reason or another this excellent cheese was a long time in finding its way 
from the north of Italy to England, although, as a matter of fact, it is considered by 
many epicures as superior to the famous Stilton cheese. In some particulars it 
resembles Stilton, but not in shape, being flat and broad. When cut, it represents, if 
it is ripe, a yellow color, with rich green veins. Unfortunately, the large existing 
demand for it has led to the substitution of weak, gummy, altogether inferior makes. 
Gorgonzola should be firm and creamy, with the two flat surfaces as nearly level as 
possible; those of inferior quality sink in the center, and are of weak substance. 



CHEESE AND FRUITS. 875 

Gruyere Cheese. 

This is a very large round, flat, thick cheese, and cuts firm, with large holes, or 
" vesicles " as they are called, containing at times a little moisture. The odor of 
Gruyere is very peculiar, but the nutty flavor of a good sample is only equalled by 
Cheddar. The best qualities are imported from Fribourg. The process employed in 
making Gruyere is unique, but there are two qualities, the better being called Em- 
menthaler, the difference being in the quality of the milk. 

Neufchatel Cheese. 

Of all the foreign-made salted milk cheeses that reach our shores, this favorite is 
the smallest. The cheese known as Bondon is a species of Neufchatel, but it is 
usually so exceedingly salt and dry to the taste that it is not a favorite. The 
ordinary Neufchatel is imported direct from the Department of Seine-et-Oise, in 
France, is very rich and well flavored, weighing from five to six ounces each, the 
best samples being blue veined. 

Parmesan Cheese. 

As the name indicates, this cheese is a native manufacture of Parma in northern 
Italy. It possesses such a sweet taste that it is everywhere employed by cooks for 
culinary purposes, especially when grated. The milk from which this cheese is 
made is drawn from cows which are kept in sheds the year around and fed in summer 
on cut grass and in winter on fine hay. The cream skimmed from the milk is used 
for butter, or the making of cream cheese, so that Parmesan is not of a very buttery 
character, and the rennet is added to the skimmed milk at a temperature of from 
eighty-six to eighty-nine degrees Fahrenheit, and the whole is then placed over a 
slow fire and the temperature raised to about one hundred and twenty degrees, the 
curd separating meanwhile into small lumps. Saffron is occasionally added to the 
milk before heating, which gives it a yellowish green hue, and the curd is then put 
under pressure. These cheeses are of mammoth size, shaped in large flat hoops, the 
edges are then rounded, the weight being in the neighborhood of one hundred and 
eighty pounds. They are of a dark, almost black color on the outside, which is 
brought about by dressing with coloring and rubbing with linseed oil until a good 
surface is procured. Parmesan cheese takes about three years to ripen, and as its size 
requires a considerable time in its consumption, it is advisable to cover the cut- 
surfaces with paper steeped in sweet oil. 

Pont-l'Ev6que Cheese. 

This is a milk cheese named after the place where it is manufactured. It is con- 
sidered inferior to Brie cheese, but it has a very good local reputation and deserves 
to be better known. 



876 CHEESE AND FRUITS. 

Port du Salut Cheese. 

This great favorite should be better known in this country. Its flavor is very 
palatable and mild, the substance pasty and soft and it possesses all the qualities of 
the best cheeses. It is shaped into round cakes, weighing from five to eight pounds 
each, and they are stamped with the name of the place of their manufacture. 

Pot Cheese. 

Place one quart of buttermilk and two quarts of sour milk in a saucepan, and 
set it over the fire till it is scalding hot; then take it off and with a skimmer remove 
the curd from the whey. Place the curd in a muslin bag, tie and hang it up to drain 
for an hour or so. Moisten the curd slightly with cream, stir in a little salt, work it 
well with the hands, then mould it into small balls. Pile these on a dish, cover them 
over, and set in a cool place till ready to serve. 

Potted Cheese. 

Cut about a pound of Cheshire cheese into dice, and put these in a mortar with 
six ounces of butter, two tablespoonfuls of finely-powdered sugar and one teaspoonful 
of mace; then pour over four or five wineglassfuls of sherry, and after it has stood for 
two or three minutes to soak, pound all well together. Work it into a smooth paste, 
and place it in jars, putting clarified butter over the top. 

Pounded Cheese. 

Chop about one pound of good dry cheese, place it in a mortar with three or 
four ounces of butter, and pound to a smooth paste. Mix with it one teaspoonful 
each of made mustard, ground spice and curry powder, and one-half teaspoonful of- 
black pepper. Stir one wineglassful of sherry into the mixture. Next cut some 
slices of bread about a quarter of an inch in thickness, cutting each slice into halves 
lengthwise; spread the cheese mixture over them, and sprinkle a little cayenne pep- 
per over each. Arrange them on a dish over which has been an ornamental paper, 
or a folded napkin, and serve. The cheese mixture can be kept in a cool place for 
several days, if pressed down into jars and covered with paper. 



Roquefort Cheese. 



This cheese is peculiar from the fact that it is made of ewe's milk, though some 
manufacturers are now using the milk of the cow. Naturally therefore it possesses a 
peculiar pungency and flavor, though in other particulars it somewhat resembles other 
veined cheeses. Upon the continent Roquefort takes precedence of many other makes, 



CHEESE AND FRUITS. 877 

whether foreign or native; but in this country it is not so generally liked. It should 
not be cut until it is well advanced in the process of decay, and then its excellence can 
not be gainsayed. The mould is procured by the introduction of mouldy bread- 
crumbs, and by pricking to admit the air. 

Sage or Green Cheese. 

This is a variety of cream cheese made by adding sage leaves and greening to 
the milk. The following is a very good recipe: Pound the tops of fresh young sage 
leaves with an equal quantity of spinach leaves, and squeeze out the juice. Add this 
to the extract of rennet, and stir into the milk a sufficient quantity to suit the taste. 
When the curd comes, break, salt it, fill the vat high with it, press for a few hours, 
and then turn the cheese every day. 

Stilton Cheese. 

This is the king of English cheeses, and, therefore, as it commands a large price, 
subject to worthless imitations. Although Stilton takes its name from a town of that 
name in Huntingdon, it is chiefly manufactured near Melton Mowbray, in other parts 
of Leicestershire, and in Nottinghamshire. It is made in the shape of a cylinder, 
twice as long as broad, weighing about twelve pounds, and having a very rough, 
irregular whitish rind. When it is cut, the substance should be white, friable, yet 
mellow, and marked with greenish blue veins. According to the prevalence of these, 
the cheese will be judged; but as Stilton takes from three to six months to ripen, 
many experiments have been tried to give it the appearance of age, though the cheese 
itself may be young. Rich new milk, to which a proportion of cream is added, the 
quality varying in proportion to the skill used in its manufacture. The milk is set at 
ninety degrees Fahrenheit, the curd is broken down in about an hour, and removed 
into large strainer cloths, from which the whey gradually escapes. As the curd be- 
comes firm, it is broken up and aired until it is sufficiently acid for salting and placing 
in vats. The vats, hoops or moulds, are filled by hand, and turned regularly until 
the cheese can be removed, and it is then covered with a clean binder every day until 
the crust commences to form, when it goes into the curing-room, and there it ripens 
better when the temperature is well maintained at from fifty-three to fifty-five degrees. 

"Strohl" Cheese. 

Rub together six ounces of butter and six ounces of flour, and add six ounces of 
grated Parmesan cheese and a small quantity of cayenne, and after this is well mixed, 
add the yolks of three eggs and one tablespoonful of raw cream, working all together 
well. Roll the paste out thin, divide it into strips about five inches long, put these 
on a baking-sheet, and bake in a brisk oven. When they are done, put them on a 
dish with a folded napkin on it, and serve. 



878 CHEESE AND FRUITS. 

Almonds and Raisins for Dessert. 

The finest quality of Valencia raisins, in good bunches, with a purple bloom on 
the fruit, are requisite for this purpose. Pile up the bunches on the dish in the form 
of a pyramid upon a lace-pattern dessert paper, and strew well-blanched almonds over 
and between the bunches. 

Salted and " Deviled" Almonds. 

Blanch and dry in a cloth as many Jordan almonds as may be required, put them 
into a fryingpan with a little butter and fry them until they are of a delicate fawn 
color. Then pour them into a colander and sprinkle them over immediately with 
fine table salt, tossing them as they are sprinkled. Serve hot or cold in little trays 
with cheese. To devil them, mix with the salt twice the quantity of cayenne pepper 
and sprinkle as before. 

Boiled Chestnuts. 

Wash thoroughly two or three pounds of chestnuts, make two cuts through the 
stem end of the shells, crossing each other so that the shells can be easily stripped 
off; tie the nuts in a napkin and boil in salted water until tender. Take them up, 
turn them into a fresh napkin laid in a salad-bowl and serve hot with fresh butter and 
salt. Claret wine should go with them. 

Roasted Chestnuts. 

Split the skin on one side of some chestnuts, put in a pan with a perforated 
bottom, stand over a moderate fire, and when they are done wrap them in a cloth for 
a few minutes. Serve them with salt and butter. 

Oranges for Dessert. 

Peel the oranges and trim off the white part, being very careful not to break the 
fruit. Put some powdered sugar in a dish, about one-half pound for two dozen 
oranges, and pour over it sufficient cochineal to give it a bright pink color; place it 
in front of a fire until well dried. Roll the oranges in the sugar, giving them a good 
coating all over, then arrange them carefully in a raised glass or dessert dish and 
serve. Oranges colored in this way are a great improvement over the ordinary way 
of serving them. 

Oranges and Bananas for Dessert. 

Peel four bananas (the red kind if possible), cut them across into rather thin 
slices and arrange them in a glass dish; strain the juice from two oranges, pour it 



CHEESE AND FRUITS. 879 

over the bananas, sprinkle them plentifully with powdered sugar and serve imme- 
diately. Or peel the oranges, slice them and arrange the slices in the dish among 
the slices of bananas. Cream, either whipped or plain, may be served with this dish, 
also sugar. 

Peaches for Dessert. 

Wipe the peaches carefully and lightly over with a clean cloth; put a circle of 
them on a dish, then over these a narrower circle, and so on, finishing off with one at 
the top and using peach leaves and moss to garnish and build them with. Put a 
circle of the moss and leaves round the base of the peaches. Vine or artificial peach 
leaves may be used if the genuine ones cannot be obtained. 



Pineapple for Dessert. 



Prepare a thick cushion of paper, called tampion, in a fancy dish, cover it well 
with dyed moss and real or artificial vine leaves, stick the stalk of the pine in the 
middle of the paper and garnish around with any other fruit desired. 



Walnuts Prepared for Dessert. 



Crack the upper half of the shells of the required quantity of walnuts, and re- 
move them carefully without damaging the kernel. Dip the exposed half of the nut 
into boiling water to facilitate peeling off the skin. Place each nut, as soon as peeled, 
in slightly acid water, which should also be cold and salted. When ready to serve, 
drain the nuts on a cloth. For dishing the nuts a pasteboard stand should be made 
with raised graduated tiers, and covered with green paper. Arrange the walnuts on 
this, using some moss to keep the nuts in position. 

Watermelon with Brandy. 

Cut out and remove a piece of the center of a watermelon; and pour in the side 
one pint of brandy; replace the piece of melon in its former position and put the 
melon on the ice-box for six hours. Set it on a dish and send to the table either 
whole or cut in slices. 

Watermelon with Champagne. 

Proceed as with brandy, using champagne instead of brandy, 

Watermelon with Rum. 

Prepare the same as watermelon with, brandy, using rum instead of brandy, and 
proceed as before.
