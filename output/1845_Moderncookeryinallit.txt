PREFACE. 



The proper and wholesonfe preparation of our daily food, 
tkmgh it may hold in the estimation of the world bnt a very 
hmnble place among the useM arts of life, can scarcely be 
confijdared an altogether unimportant one, involving so entirely, 
as it does, both health and comfort 

England is, beyond most other countries, rich in the varied 
and abundant produce of its soil, or of its commerce, which in 
torn supply to it all that the necessities or the luxury of its 
people can demand; yet, until within very recent years, its 
cookery has remained far inferior to that of nations much less 
advanced in civilization ; and foreigners have been called in to 
furnish to the tables of our aristocracy, and of the wealthier 
orders of the community, those refinements of the art which 
were not to be obtamed from native talent 

Our improvement was for a long time opposed by our own 
strong and stubborn prejudices against innovation in general, 
and against the innovations of strangers in particular ; but these, 
of late, have &st given way before the more rational and liberal 
spirit of the times: hapi»ly for ourselves, we have ceased to be 
too bigoted, or too proud to profit by the superior information 
and experience of others upon any subject of utility. The pre- 
sent age is one of rapid and universally progressing knowledge;

, TIU PREFACE. 

and nothing which is really calculated to advanee either^ the 
great or th» small interests of society is now regarded as too 
homely or too insignificant for notice. The detaHs (of domestic 
economy, in particular, are no longer sneered at as beneath the 
attention of the educated and accomplished ; and l^e truly 
refined, intelligent, and high-minded wcxnen of England have 
ceased, in these days of comparative good sense, to consider 
their aoquainWice with such details as inoonsiistent with^their 
dignity, or injurious to their attractions : — and who can direct 
their households with the same taste, the same judgment, and 
the same watchful care for the comfort of others as themselves? 
Who, indeed, can guard aU the interests of home as they can? 
And surely a woman does not preside less pleasingly in her 
own immediate circle, nor do the honours of her table, or of 
her drawing-room, with less, grace and propriety for haying 
given (often from pursuits much more congenial to her) some 
portion of the day to the examination, and control of her do- 
mestic affairs; it is rare, too, we should suppose, for a husband 
to be otherwise than grateful to his wife for the exertion of a 
surveillance which, if steadily and judiciously maintained, will 
affect his expenditure beyond all that a careless calculator 
would imagine possible. This, at a period when the struggle 
for income is so general, and the means of half the families 
holding a certain rank in the world are so insufficient for the 
support of their position,' is a consideration of very 4eep im- 
portance. 

Few things are more certain to involve persons of .narrow 
fortune in painful difficulties than the ruinous, because constant 
(though not always perceptible), extravagance which so often 
exists in every department of a house of which the sole regula- 
tion is left to servants, who, more than any other class of people 
in the world, would appear to be ignorant of the true value of 



PREFACE. IX 

BViiiey, and of the meana of eoonomiziiig it. We speak, of 
oourae, of the generality. Some amongst them th^re are, we 
know, eqnally trustworthy and conscientious, who proteotriheir 
eiB^oyers* property from abuse more scrupulously ev.^j^tkAi* if 
it. were their own ; but the greater number are recklesB:<sfa6u|;h 
in thdr wasteful profusion when uncontrolled by the eye of a 
superior : an inexperienced housekeeper cannot be too soon 
aware of this. It sometimes happens, however, that the young 
mistress of a &mily has had no opportunity before her mar* 
riage of acquiring the knowledge which would enable her to 
conduct her household contems as she could desire ; and that, 
with a high sense of her duties, and an earnest wish to fulfil 
them to the utmost, she is prevented by her entire ignorance of 
domestic affairs &om accomplishiog her object. In such a case, 
unless she should chance to possess that rare treasure of com- 
mon ^English life, a superior cook,* the economy of her table 
will not be amongst the lightest of her difiiculties; and she 
may be placed, perhaps, by circumstances at a distance from 
every friend who could counsel or assist her. Thrown thus 
entirely upon her own resources, she ^W naturally and gladly 
avail herself of the aid to be derived from such books as can 
really afford to her the information she requires. Many ad- 
mirably calculated to do this, in part, are already in possession 
of 1^6 public; but amongst the large number of works on 
cookery, which we have carefully perused, we have never yet 
« met vdth one which appeared; to us either quite intended for, or 

• 

* It can scarcely be expected that good cooks should abound amongst us, if wq 
eonrider how very few receive any training to fit them for their business. Every 
crafl haa its apprentices ; but servants are generally left to scramble together at 
they can, from any source which accident may open to them, a knowledge of 
their respective duties. We have often thought, that schools in which these 
duties ahonld be taught them thoroughly, would be of far greater benefit to them 
than is the half-knowledge of comparative un-useful matters so frequently bQ« 
sUMved on fliem by charitable educationifts. 



X PREFACE. 

entirely suited to the need of the totally inexperienced ; none, i^ 
fact, which contained the first rudiments of the art, with direc- 
tions so practical, clear, and sunple, as to be at once understood, 
and easily followed, by those who had no previous knowledge 
of the subject. This deficiency, we have endeavoured in the 
present volume to supply, by such thoroughly explicit and 
minute instructions as may, we trust, be readily comprehended 
and carried out by any class of learners ; our receipts, moreover, 
with a few trifling exceptions which are scrupulously specified, 
are confined to such as may be perfectly depended cn^ &om 
having been proved beneath our own roof and under our own 
personal inspection. We have trusted nothing to others ; but 
having desired sincerely to render the work one of genuine use- 
fulness, we have spared neither cost nor labour to make it so, 
as the vety plan on which it has been written must of itself, 
we think, evidently prove. It contdns some novel' features, 
calculated, we hope, not only to facilitate the labours of the 
kitchen, but to be of service likewise to those by whom they 
are directed. The principal of these is the summary appended 
to the xecdptB, of L di£!ent ingredients w^Teyrntain, 
with the exact proportion of each, and the precise time required 
to dress the whole. This shows at a glance what articles have 
to be prepared before hand, and the hour at which they must 
be ready ; while it afibrds great facility as well, for an estimate 
of the expense attending them. The additional space occupied 
by this closeness of detail has necessarily prevented the admis- 
sion of so great a variety of receipts as the book might otherwise 
have comprised; but a limited number, thus completely ex- 
plauied, may perhaps be more acceptable to the reader than a 
larger mass of materials vaguely given. 

Our directions for boning poultiy, game, &c., are also, we 
may venture to say, entirely new, no author thf^t is known to

ns having hitherto afforded the slightest information on the 
suhject ; but .while we have done our utmost to simplify and to 
render intelli^ble this, and several other processes not generally 
well understood by ordinary cooks, our first and best attention 
has been bestowed on those articles of food of which the con- 
sumption is the most general, and which are therefore of the 
greatest consequence; and on what are usually termed plain 
T^n gliah dishes. With these we have intermingled m^ny foreign 
ones which we know to be excellent of their kind, and which 
now so far belong to our national cookery, as to be met with 
commonly at all refined modem tables. But we find that we 
have, in every way, so far exceeded the limits assigned to us for 
our volume, that we feel compelled to take here our somewhat 
abrupt leave of the reader; who will, no doubt, discover easily, 
without our assistance, both any merit and any deficiency which 
may exist in the work*

MODERN COOKERY. 

CHAPTER L 
• SOUPS. 

INTBODX7CTOST BEMASKS. 

The art of preparing good, wholesome, palatable sonps, without 
great expense^ which is so well imderstood in France, and in 
other countries where they form part of the daily food of all 
dasses of the people, has hitherto been very much neglected in 
England ; it is one, therefore, to which we woidd particularly 
direct the attention of the cook, who will find, we think, on « 
careM perusal of the present chapter, that it presents no diffi- 
culties which a common degree oi care and skill will not easily 
oTercome. The reader, who may be desirous to excel in it, 
should study the instructions given under the article Bouillon, 
where the principles of this branch of cookery are ftdly ex- 
plamed. 

The spices and other condiments used to give flayour to soups 
and grayies should be so nicely proportioned that none predo- 
minate nor overpower the rest; and this delicate blending of 
savours is perhaps the most difficult part of a cook's task : it is 
an art, moreover, not easily acquired, except by long experience, 
unless sreat attention be combined with some natural refine- 
ment of the palate. 

A zealous servant will take all possible pains on her first 
entrance into a family, to ascertain the particular tastes of the 
individuals she serves ; and will be guided entirely by them in 
the preparation of her dishes, however much they may be 
opposed to her own ideas, or to her previous practice. 

Exceeding cleanliness, both in her personal nabits and appear- 
ance, and in every department of her work, is so essential in a 
cook, that no degree of skill, nor any other good qualities which 
she may possess, can ever atone for the want of it. The very 
ideji of a dirty cook is so revoltine, that few people will bft

induced to tolerate tbe reality ; and we wcold therefore most 
stronglj urge all* emplojed m the culinary department of a 
household, who may oe anxioiiB lor their own aiiccess in Ii&, or 
Bolicitoua to obtain the respect and approbation of their employetB, 
to strive to the utmost agdnst any tendency to alovamness of 
which they may be consciODS, or which may be pointed ont to 
them by others. 




Uodem Ctipr»t Stock- 



r DlBGCTIONa 1 



In whatever ■vessel soup is boiled, see that it be perfectly 
clean, and let the inside of the cover and the rim be eqnally 
so. Wash the meat, and prepare the vegetables with great 
nicety before they are laid mto it; and be caretul to keep it 
always closely shut when it is on the fire. , Never, on any 
account, set the soap by in it, but strain it off at once into a 
clean pan, mid fill the stock-pot immediately with water : pur- 
sue the same plan with all stewpans and saucepans directly they 
are emptied. 

Skim the soup thoroughly when it ^nt begins to boil, or it 
can never afterwards be rendered dear ; throw in some salt, 
which will assist to bring the scum to the surface, and when it 
has all been taken off, add the herbs and vegetablea ; for if not 
long Btewed in the aoup their flavour will prevwl too strongly. 
Remember, that the trimmings, and especially the bones ot 
fresh meat, the necks of poultry, the liquor in which a joint 
baa been boiled, and the shank-bones of mutton, are all excel- 
lent additions to the stock-pot, and should be carefully reserved 
for it.

CHAP. I.] SOUPS. 8 

Let the soup heat gradually over a moderate fire, and after 
it has he^i well skimmed, draw it to the side of the stove and 
keep it simmerins softly^ hut without ceasing, until it is done ; 
for on this, as will her^fler he shown, its excellence principally 
depends. Every good cook understands perfectly the difference 
produced hy the nist hoiling, or the gentle slewing of soups and 
gravies, and will adhere strictly to the latter method. 

Pour hoiling water, in small quantities at first, to the meat 
and v^etahles of which the soup is to he made when they have 
been ined or browned; but otherwise, add co/o? water to the 
meat 

Unless precise orders to the contraiy have been given, onions, 
eschalots, and garlic, should be used for seasoning with great 
moderation always; for not only are they very offensive to 
many eaters, but to persons of delicate habit, their effects are 
sometimes extremely prejudicial; and it is only in coarse 
cookery that their flavour is allowed ever strongly to prevail. 

A small proportion of sugar, about an ounce to the gallon, will 
very much improve the flavour of gravy-stock, and of all rich 
brown soups ; it may be added also to some' others with advan- 
tage ; and for this, directions will be given in the proper places. 

Two ounces of salt may be allowed for each gallon of soup or 
broth in which large quantities of vegetables are stewed ; but . 
an ounce and a half will be sufficient for such as contain few or 
none ; it is always easy to add more Lf needful, but oversalting 
in the first instance is a fault for which there is no remedy but 
that of increasing the proportions of all the other ingredients, 
and stewing the whole afresh, which occasions needless trouble 
and expense, even when time will admit of its being done. 

As no particle of fat should be seen floating on your soups 
when they are sent to table, it is desirable that the stock should 
be made the day before it is wanted, that it may become quite 
cold, when the fat may be entirely cleared off without difficiilty. 

When cayenne pepper is not mixed with rice-flour, or with 
any other tnickening, grind it down with the back of a spoon, 
and stir a little liquid to it before it is thrown into the stewpan, 
as it is apt to remain in lumps, and to occasion great irritation 
of the throat when swallowed so. 

Serve, not only soups an4 sauces, but all your dishes as hot 
as possible. 

TO THICKEN SOUPS. 

Except for white soups, to which arrow-root is, we think, 
more appropriate, we prefer, to all other ingredients generally 



i MODERN COOKERY. []CHAP. t. 

Iised for this purpose, the finest and freshest rioe-flour, which 
after being passed through a lawn-sieve, should be thoroughly 
blended with the salt, pounded spices, catsup, or wine, reouired 
to finish the flavouring of the soup. Sufficient liquid should 
be added to it very gradually to render it of the consistency of 
batter, and it shomd also be perfectly smooth ; to keep it so, it 
should be moistened sparingly at first, and beaten with the back 
of a spoon until every lump has disappeared. The soup should 
boil quicklv when the thickening is stirred into it, and be 
simmered for ten minutes afterwards. From an ounce and a 
half to two ounces of rice-flour will thicken sufficiently a quart 
of soup. 

Instead of this, arrow-root or the condiment known by the 
name of tous les mois^ which greatly resembles it, or potato- 
flour, or the French thickening called roux (see page 96 ) may 
be used in the following proportions : — ^Two and a half ounces 
of either of the first three, to four pints and a half of soup ; to 
be mixed gradually with a little cold stock or water, stirred into 
the boiliag soup, and simmered for a minute. 

Six ounces of flour with seven of butter,* will be required to 

thicken a tureen of soup ; as much as half a pound is sometimes 

used; these must be added by degrees, and careftilly stirred 

* round in the soup until smoothly blended with it, or they will 

remain in lumps. «, 

All the ingredients used for soups should be fresh, and of 
good quality, particularly Italian pastes of every kind (macca- 
roni, vermicelli, &c.), as they contract, by long keeping, a 
peculiarly impleasant, musty flavour. 

Onions, freed from the outer skin, dried gradually to a deep 
brown, in a slow oven, and flattened like Norfolk biffins, will 
keep for almost any length of time, and are extremely usefiil 
for neightening the colour and flavour of broths and gravies.f 

• 

TO FSY BBEAD TO SEBVE WITH SOUP. 

Cut some slices a quarter-inch thick, from a stale loaf; pare 

off the crust, and divide the bread into dice, or cut it with a 

" deep paste-cutter into any other form. For half a pound of 

bread put two ounces of the best butter into a frying-pan, and 

when it is quite melted, add the bread ; keep it turned, over a 

* We would recommend an; other thickening in preference to this unwhole- 
some mixture. 

<t 'lite fourth part of one of these dried onions (<20« oignora brUlisX of modcrafe 
size, is sufficient for a tureen of soup. They are sold very commonly in France, 
and may be procured, vfe should suppose, without difiicuity la London, at tho 
foreign warehouses. «.

gentle fire, imtQ it is equally coloured to a very pale brown, 
then drain it from the butter, and dry it on a soft cloth, or a 
sheet of paper placed before a dear fire, upon a dish, or on 
a aeye reversed. 

/ SIPPETS A UL BEnns. 

I Haying cut the bread as for common sippets, spread it on a 
dish, and pour over it a few spoonsful of tlun cream, or of good 
^ mUk ; let it soak for an hour, then fiy it in fresh butter of a 
I delicate brown, drain, and serve the sippets hot. 

TO MAXE NOUILLES; 

(An degant substitute for Vermicelli.) 

« 

Wet, with the yolks of four eggs, as much fine, dry, sifted 
ioar as will make them into a firm but very smooth paste. 
Roll it out as thin as possible, and cut it into bsmds of about an 
inch and a quarter in width. Dust them lightly with flour, and 
place four of them one upon the other. Cut tnem obliquely in 
the finest possible strips ; separate them with the point of a 
I loiife, and spread them on writing paper, so that they may dry 
a little before they are used. Drop them gradually into the 
boiling soup, and in ten minutes they will be done. 

Various other forms may be given to this paste at will. It 
Diay be divided into a sort of riband maccaroni ; or stamped 
yim small confectionary cutters into different shapes. 

VEGETABLE VEBMICELLI. 

(Vegetables cut very fine fw Soups,') 

Cat the carrots into inch-lengths, then pare them round and

next cut these ribands into straws, or very small strips ; celery

ri&nds, then sliced into strips : these last require less boiling 
than the carrots, and attention must be paid to this, for if 
broken, the whole would have a bad appearance in soup. The 
safer plan is tt> boil each vegetable separately, tQl tolerably 
tender, in a little pale broth (in water if this be not at hand), to 
drain them well, and put them into the soup, which should be 
clear, only a few minutes before it is dished. For cutting them

BOUILLON. 

(The Common Soup cf France ; cheap, arid very wholesome,) 

This soup, or hroth^ as we should perhaps designate it in 
England, is made once or twice in the week, in every &mi^ of 

respectability in France ; and by 
the poorer classes as often as their 
means will enable them to substi- 
tute it for the vegetable or maigre 
soups, on which they are more 
commonly obliged to subsist. It 
is served usually on the first day, 
with slices of untoasted bread 
soaked in it ; on the second, it is 

^^^ generally varied with vermicelli, 

French Pa^wm-Ftfu ; or. Earthen rice, or semoulina. The ingre- 

Soup Pot. dients are, of course, often otner- 

wise proportioned than as we have given them, and more or less 

ineat is sdlowed, according to the taste or circumstances of the 

persons for whom the bomllon is prepared ; but the process of 




making it is always the same, and is thus described (rather 

dly)bv " " ' _ 

stock-pot or the French artisan,** says Monsieur Careme, 



learnedly) by one of the most skilM cooks in Europe : *' The 



'^ supplies his' principal nourishment ; and it is thus managed by 
his wife, who, without the slightest knowledge of chemistry, 
cond.ucts the process in a truly scientific maimer. She first lays 
the meat into her earthen stock-pot, and pours cold water to it 
in the proportion of about two quarts to three pounds of the 
beef ;''^ she then places it by the side of the fire, where it 
slowly becomes hot; and as it does so, the heat enlarges the 
fibre of the meat, dissolves the gelatinous substances which it 
contains, idlows the albumen ^r the muscular part which 
produces the scum) to disengage itself and rise to tne surface, 
and the osmazome (jvhich is the most savoury part of the meat) 
to be diffused through the broth. Thus, m>m the simple 
circumstance of boiling it in the gentlest manner, a relishing and 
nutritious soup will be obtained, and a dish of tender and 
palatable meat ; but if the pot be placed and kept over a quick 
fire, the albumen will coagulate, harden the meat, prevent the 
water from penetrating it, and the osmazome from disengaging 

* Thif is a large proportion of meat for the familf of a French artisan ; a 
pound to the quart would be nearer the reality; bat It' is not the reAise-meat 
which would be purchased by persons of the same rank in England for making: 
broth.

.' itself; the result Tnll be a broUi without flavoar or goodness, 
add a tough, dry bit of meat.** 
It must be ofaseryed in addition, that as the meat of which the 
, bouillon is made, is almost invariably sent to table, a part of the 
; romp, the monse-buttock, or the It^-of-mutton piece of bee^ 
should be selected for it ; and the simmering shoidd be continued 
only until this is perfectly tender. When the object is mmply 
to make good, pure-flavoinred beef broth, part of the shin, or leg, 
with a pound or two of the neck, will best answer the pm^xMe. 
When the botUU (that is to say, the beef which is boiled in the 
soup), is to be served, bind it into a good shape, add to it a calTs 
foot, if easily procurable, as this much improves the quality of 
the houHlon, pour cold water to it in the proportion mentioned 
above, and proceed, as Monsieur CarSme directs, to heat the soup 
^hwly by the side of the fire ; remove carefully the head of 
ficom, wnich will gather on the surface before the boiling oom- 
mences, and continue the skimming at intervals, for about 
twenty minutes longer, pouring in once or twice a little cold 
water. Next, add salt in the proportion of two ounces to the 
gallon ; this will cause a little more scum to rise, — dear it quite 
of^ and throw in three or four tumins, as many carrots, htdf a 
bead of celery, four or five young leeKS, an onion stuck with sis 
or eight cloves, a large haLf-teaspoonful of pepper-corns, and a 
bunch of savoury herbs. Let the whole stew tery sofUy, 
without ceasinff, &om four hours and a half to six hours, 
according to the quantity: the beef in that time will be 
extremely tender, but not overdone. It will be excellent eating, 
if properly managed, and might often, we think, be substitute 
with great advantage for the hard, half-boiled, salted beef so 
often seen at an English table. It should be served with a 
couple of cabbages, \mich have been first boiled in the usual 
way, then pressed very dry, and stewed for about ten minutes 
in a little of the broth, ana seasoned with pepper and salt. The 
other vegetables from the bouillon may be laid round it or not, 
at choice. The soup, if served on the same day, must be 
strained, well cleared from &t, and sent to table with fried or 
toasted bread, unless the Continental mode of putting slices or 
crusts of untoasted bread into the tureen, and soaking them for 
ten minutes in a ladleful or two of the bouillon, be, from custom, 
preferred. 

Beef, 8 to 9 lbs. ; water, 6 quarts ; salt, 3 02s. (more if

^OTDSy one small teaspoonM ; large buncH of sarooiy herbs : 
. (calf 8 foot if conyenient) to simmer 5 to 6 hours. 

Obg. 1. — This broth forms in France the foundation of all 
richer soups and gravies. Poured on fresh meat (a portion of 
whidi should be veal) instead of water, it makes at once an 
excellent consojnfn^e^ or strong jellied stock. If properly man* 
aged, it is veiy clear and pale ; and with an additional weight 
of bee^ and some spoonsml of glaze, may easily be converted 
into an amber-coloured gravy-soup, suited to modem taste. 

Obs. 2.-- It is a common practice abroad to boil poultry, 
pigeons, and even game, in the pot'Ou-feu^ or soup-pot. They 
should be properly trussed, stewed in the broth just long enough 
to render them tender, and served immediately, when rea^, 
with a good sauce. A small ham, if well soaked, washed ex- 
ceeding]^ clean, and freed entirely from any rusty, or blackened 
parts, laid with the beef when the water vs first added to it, and 
t)oiled from three hours and a half to four hours, in the 
bouillon, is very sujperior in flarvour to those cooked in water 
only, and infinitely unproves the soup, which cannot, however, 
so well be eaten until the following day, when all the fat can 
easily be Xsk&i from it : it would, of course, require no salt. 

CLEAR, PALE, 6BAVT-SOUP OB STOCK. 

Rub a deep stewpan or soup-pot with butter, and \m into it 
three quarters of a pound of nam freed entirely from rat, skin, 
and rust, four pounds of leg or neck of veal, and the same 
weight of lean beef all cut into l^ck slices ; set it over a clear 
and rather brisk fire, until the meat is of a fine amber-colour : 
it must be oflen moved, and closely watched, that it may not 
stick to the pan, nor bum* When it is equally browned^ lay 
the bones upon it, and pour in gradually four quarts of boiling 
water. Take off the scmn caretiiilly as it rises, and throw in a 
pint of cold water at intervals, to bring it quickly" to the 
surface. When no more appears, add two ounces of salt, two 
onions, two large carrots, two turnips, one head of celery, a 
two-ounce faggot of savoury herbs, a dozen cloves, half a 
teaspoonfrd of whole white pepper, and two large blades of 
mace. Let the soup boil gently from five hours and a hal^. to 
six hours and a half; then strain it through a very clean, fine 
cloth, laid in a hair sieve. When it is perfectly cold, remove 
eveiy particle of fat from the top ; and, in taJdng out the soup, 
leave the sediment untouched; heat in a clean pan the quantity 
required for table, add salt to it if needed, and a few drops of 
Chili or of cayenne vinegar. Harvey's sauce, or very fine 



CHAP. I.^ SOTTPd. d 

mushroom catsup, may be substituted for these. When thus 
prepared, the soup is ready to serve : it should be accompanied 
by pale sippets of fried bread, or sippets a la reine. Rice, 
maccaroni in lengths or rings, vermicelli, or nomlles, may in 
turn be used to vary it ; but they must always be boiled apart 
till tender, in broth, or water, and well drained before they are 
sUpped into it. The addition of young vegetables, too, and 
especially of asparagus, will convert it into an elegant spring- 
soup ; but they, likewise, must be separately cooked. 

ANOTHER EECEIPT FOR GRAVT-80UP. 

Instead of browning the meat in its own juices, put it with 
the onions and carrots, into a deep stewpan, with a quarter-pint 
of bouillon ;* set it over a brisk fire at mrst, and when the broth 
is somewhat reduced, let it boil gently until it has taken a fine 
colour and forms a glaze (or jeUy) at the botton of the stew- 
paii.;^.then pour to it the proper quantity of water, and finish 
the soup by the preceding receipt.* 

Obs.—A rich, old-&shioned English brown gravy-soup may 
be made with beef only. It should be cut Srom the bones, 
dredged with flour, seasoned with pepper and salt, and fried a 
clear brown; then stewed for six hours, if the quantity be 
large, with a pint of water to each pound of meat, and vege- 
tables as above, except onions, of which four moderate-sized ones, 
also fried, are to be added to every three quarts of the soup, 
which, after it has been strained, and cleared from fat, may be 
thickened with sax ounces of fresh butter, worked up veiy 
smoothly with five of flour. In twenty minutes afterwards, a 
tablespoonful of the best soy, half a pint of sherry, and a 
tittle cayenne, may be added to the soup, which will then be 
ready to scire. 

CHEAP, CLEAR GRAVT-SOUP. 

The shin or leg of bee^ if not large or coarse, will answer 

* Tb0 jnices of meat, drawn out with a small portion of liquid, as directed Hbre, 
m^ easily be reduced to the consistency in wliich they form wliat is called 
glaze J for particulars of this, see Chapter III. The best method, though pertiaps 
not the easiest, of malcing tlie clear, amber-coloured stoclc, is to pour a ladleful 
or two of pale, but strong beef-broth to the real, and to boil it briskly imtil well 
xedttoed, tluusting a linife, when this is done, into the meat, to let the Juices 
escape ; then to proceed more slowly and cautiously as the liq«id approaches the 
state in wliich it would burn. It must be allowed to take a dark amber-colour 
Ottly^ and the meat must be turned, and often moved in it. When the desired 
point is reached, pour in more boiling broth, and let the pan remain off the fire 
tot a few minutes, to detach and melt the glaxe ; then shake it mell round before 
the boiling is continued. A certain quantity of deeply coloured glace, made 
apart, and stirred into strong, clear, pale Btock> would produce the desired effect 
of this, witb much less trouble.

extremely well for this soap, and afford at the same time a 
highly economical dish of boiled meat, which will be found 
very tender, and very palatable also, if it be served with a 
sauce of some piquancy. From about ten pounds of the meat 
let the butcher cut evenly off five or six m)m the thick fleshy 
part, and again divide tne knuckle, that the whole may lie 
compactly in the vessel in which it is to be stewed. Pour in 
three quarts of cold water, and when it has been brought slowly 
to boil, and been well skinmied, as directed for bouillon (page 
6), throw in an ounce and a half of salt, half a large teaspoon^ 
of pepper-corns, eight cloves, two blades of mace, a bunch of 
savoury herbs, a couple of small carrots,' and the heart of a 
root of celerv : to these add a mild onion or not, at choice. 
When the whole has stewed very softly for four hours, probe 
the larger bit of beef, and if quite tender, lift it out for table ; 
let the soup be simmered &om two to three hours longer, and 
then strain it through a fine sieve, into a clean pan. When it 
is perfectly cold, clear off every particle of fat ; heat a eouple 
of quarts, stir in, when it boils, half an ounce of sugar, a small 
tablespoonfiil of good soy, and twice as much of Harvey's 
sauce, or should this not be at hand, of clear and fine mushroom 
catsup. If carefully made, the soup will be perfectly trans- 
parent and of good colour and flavour. A thicK slice of lean 
nam will improve it, and a pound or so of the neck of beef 
with an additional pint of water, will likewise enrich its quality. 
A small quanti^ of good broth may be made of the fragments 
of the whole boiled down with a few fresh vegetables. 

Brown caper, or hot horse-radish sauce, or satice Robert, or 
sauce piquante, made with the liquor in which it is boiled, may 
be served with the portion of the meat which is sent to table. 

VESMICELU SOUP. 

(JPotage au Vermicelle,) 

Drop very lightly, and by degrees, six ounces of vermicelli, 
broken rather small, into three quarts of boiling bouillon, or 
clear gravy soup ; let it simmer for half an hour* over a gentle 
fire, and stir it often. This is the common French mode of 
making vermicelli soup, and we can recommend it as a particu- 
larly good one for family use. In England it is customary to 
soak, or to blanch the vermicelli, then to drain it well, and to 

* When of my fine quality, the Termlcelli will usually require less boiling 
than this. We have named to the reader, in another part of the volume, Mr. Cob- 
bett, 18, Pall Mall, aa supplying all the Italian pastes extremely good. 



CHAP. I.] 80VF8. 11 

stew it &r a shorter time in the soup ; the quantity, also, must 
be reduced quite two ounces, to suit modem taste. 

Bouillon, or gravy-soup, 3 quarts; vermicelli, 6 ozs.; 30 
minutes. Or, soup, 3 quarts ; vermicelli, 4 ozs. ; blanched in 
boiling water 5 minutes ; stewed in soup 10 to 15 minutfiw. 

SEMOUUNA SOUP. 

(Soupe a la Semaule.^ 

Semoulina is used in the same way as the yermicellL It 
should be dropped very lightly and by degrees into the boiling 
eonp, which should be stirred all the time it is beins added, and 
Teiy frequently afterwards ; indeed, it should scarc^y be quitted 
for a moment until it is ready for table. Skim it careftdly, and 
let it simmer from twenty to five and twenty minutes. This, 
when the semoulina can l>e procured good and fresh, is, to our 
taste, an excellent soup. 

Soup, 3 quarts; semoulina 6 ozs.: nearly, or quite 25 
loinutes. 

BIACCASONI SOUP. 

Throw four onnces of fine fresh* mellow maccaroni into a pan 
of ^-boiling water, with about an ounce of fresh butter, and a 
snuQl onion stuck with three or four cloves.^ When it has 
swelled to its full size, and become tender, drain it well, and 
slip into it a couple of quarts of clear gravy-soup ; let it simmer 
for a few minutes, when it will be ready for table. Observe, 
that the maccaroni should be boiled quite tender ; but iit should 
by no means be allowed to burst, nor to become pulpy. Serve 
gT^ted Parmesan cheese with it. 

Maccaroni, 4 ozs. ; butter, 1 oz. ; 1 small onion ; 5 doves : 
i hour, or more. In soup, 5 to 10 minutes. 

Obs. — The maccaroni for soups should always be either 
broken into short lengths before it is boiled, or sliced quickly 
afterwards into small rings not more than the sixth of an inch 
thick, unless the ciU maccaroni, which may be purchased at the 
Italian warehouses, be used; this requires but ten minutes* 
boiling, and should be dropped into the soup in the same way as 
venniceUL Four ounces of it will be sujSicient for two quarts of 
stock. It may be added to white soup after having been pre- 
ymaly boiled in water or veal-broth, and well drained from it : 

* We mntt bere repeat onr warning against the u>e of long-lcept maccaroni,

it has a rather elegant appearance in clear grav^-soup, but

P0TA6E AUX NOUILLES, OR TAILLEBINE SOUP. 

Make into nonille-paste the yolks of four fresh eggs, and 
when ready cut, drop it gradually into fiye pints of boiling soup ; 
keepthis gently stirred for ten minutes, skW it well, anS serve 
it quickly,. This is a less common, and a more delicately fla- 
youred soup than the yermicelli, proyided always that the 
nouilles be made with really fresh eggs. The same paste may 
be cut into yery small diamonds, squares, stars, or any other 
form, then left to dry a little, and boiled in the soup until swelled 
to its frdl size, and tender. 

Nouille-paste of four eggs ; soup, 5 pints : 10 minutes. 

SAGO SOUP. 

Wash in seyeral waters, and float off the dirt from six ounces 
of sago; put it into three quarts of good cold ^yy-stock; let 
it stew gently from half to three quarters of an hour, and stir it 
occasiomdly, that it may not bum nor stick to the stewpan. A 
quarter-ounce more of sago to each pint of liquid, will thicken 
it to the consistency of peas-soup. It may be flayoured witk 
half a wineglassful of Haryey*s sauce, as much cayenne as it may- 
need, the juice of half a lemon, an ounce of sugar, and two 
glasses of snerry; or these may.be omitted, and good beef-broth 
may be substituted for the grayy-soup, for a simple family 
dinner, or for an inyalid. 

Sago, 6 ozs. ; soup, 3 quarts : 30 to 45 minutes. 

TAPIOCA SOUP. 

This is made in the same manner, and with the ^ame propor- 
tions as the preceding soup, but it must be simmered from fifty 
to sixty minutes. 

BICE SOUP. 

In France this soup is seryed well thickened with the rice, 
which is stewed in it for upwards of an hour and a hali^ and 
makes thus, eyen with the com^lon bouillon of the country, an 
excellent winter potage. Pick, and wipe in a diy cloth, eight 
ounces of the best rice ; add it, in small portions, to four quarts 
of hot pouf^ of which the boiling should not be checked as it is 
thrown in. When a clear sonjf is wanted, wash the rice, giye it 
fiye minutes* boil in water, dram it well, throw it into as much 
boiling stock or well-flayoured broth as will keep it coyered till

done, and siimner it veiy softly until the grains are tender, but 
still separate ; drain it, uip it mto the soup, and let it remain in 
it a few minutes before it is served, but without simmering. 
Wlien stewed in the stock, it may be put at once, aft^ 
being drained, into the tureen, and the dear gravy-soup may be 
poured to it 

An easy English mode of making rice-soup is this : put the 
rice into plenty of cold water; when it boils, throw in a small 
quantity of salt, let it sinmier ten minutes, drain it well, throw 
it into the boiling soup, and simmer it gently from ten to 
fifteen minutes longer ; some rice will be tender in half that 
time. An extra quantity of stock must be allowed for the 
reduction of this soup, which is always considerable^ 

WHITE BICE SOUP. 

Throw four ounces of well-washed rice into boiling water, 
and in five minutes after pour it into a sieve, drain it well, and 
put it into a couple of quarts of good white, boiling stock ; let it 
stew till tender; season the soup with salt, cayenne, and 
pounded mace ; stir to it three quarters of a pint of very .rich 
cream, give it one boil, and serve it quickly. 

Rice, 4 ozs. : boiled 5 minutes. Soup, 2 quarts : f hour 
or more. Seasoning of salt, mace, and cayenne ; cream, f pint : 
1 minute. 

BICE-IXOTJB SOUP. 

Mix with a little cold broth, eight ounces of fine rice-flour, 
and pour it into a couple of quarts of fast-boiling broth 
or gravy soup. Add to it mace, and cayenne, with a little 
salt if n^iul. It will require but ten minutes* boiling. 

Soap, 2 quarts ; rice-flour, 8 ozs. : 10 minutes. 

Obs. — Two dessertspoonsliil of currie-powder, and the strained 
juice of half a moderate-sized lemon will greatly improve this 
soup : it may also be converted into a good common white soup, 
(if it be made of veal stock), by the Edition of three-quarters 
of a pint of tliick cream to the nee. i 



STOCK FOB WHITE SOUP. 

Though a knuckle of veal is usually preferred for this stock, 
Tart of the neck will, on an emergency, answer very well. 
Whichever joint be chosen, let it be thoroughly washed, once or 
twice divided, and laid into a delicately clean soup-pot, or well- 
tinned large stout iron saucepan, upon a pound of lean ham, 
freed entirely from skin and fat, and cut into thick slices. 



14 MODERN COOKERY. [C^AP. I. 

Should very rich soup be wished for, pour in a pint only of cold 
water for each pound of meat, but otherwise a pint and a half 
may be allowed. When the soup has been thoroughly cleared 
from scum, which should be carefully taken off, from the time 
of its first beginning to boil, throw m an ounce of salt to the 
gallon (more can be added afterwards if needed), two mild 
onions, a moderate-sized head of celery, two carrots, a small 
teaspoonful of whole white pepper, and two blades of mace ; and 
let the soup stew very softly from five to six hours, if the 
quantity be large : it should sunmer until the meat falls from 
toe bones. The skin of a calTs head, a calTs foot, or an old 
fowl may always be added to this stock with good effect. Strain 
it into a clean deep pan, and keep it in a cool place till wanted 
for use. 

Lean ham, 1 lb. ; veal, 7 lbs. ; water, 4 to 6 quarts ; salt, 
1| oz. (more if needed) ; onions, 2 ; celery, 1 head ; carrots, 2 ; 
pepper-corns, 1 teaspooniul ; mace, 2 blades : 5 to 6 hours. 

MUTTON-STOCK FOB SOUPS. 

Equal parts of beef and mutton, with the addition of a small 
portion of ham, or of very lean bacon, make excellent stock, 
especially for winter-soups. The necks of fowls, the bones of 
an undressed calfs head, or of any uncooked joint may be 
added to it with advantage. According to the quality of soup 
desired, pour from a pint to a pint and a half or cold water to 
each pound of meat; and after the liquor has been well skim- 
med on its beginning to boil, throw in an ounce and a half of salt 
to the gallon, two small heads of celery, three mild, middling-sized 
onions, three well-flavoured turnips, as many carrots, a fiiggot 
of thyme and parsley, half a teaspoonftil of white peppercorns, 
twelve cloves, and a large blade of mace. Draw tne soup-pot 
to the side of the fire, and boil the stock as gently as possible for 
about six hours ; then strain, and set it by for use. Be particu-* 
larly careful to clear it entirely from fat before it is prepared for 
table. One third of beef or vealy with two of mutton, will 
make very good soup ; or mutton only will answer the purpose 
quite well upon occasion.

a &ggot of savoury herbs, and one large onion stuck with a 
a dozen doves, for nearly four hours, when the ears may be

strain the soup, and set it in a cool place that it m^ become 
cold enough mr the fat to be quite cleared from it. ^^lext, bone 
the ears and feet, cut the flesh down into dice, throw a clean 
folded doth over it, and leave it so until the soup requires to be 
prepared for table; then strew upon it two tablespoonsful of 
saTouiy herbs minoed small, half a saltspoonfril of cayenne, a 
little white pepper, and some salt. Put mto a large saucepan 
half a pound of good butter, and when it be^s to simmer 
thicken it gradually with as much flour as it wiU absorb ; keep 
these stirred over a very gentle fire for ten minutes or more, but 
do not allow them to take the slightest colour ; pour the soup to 
them by degrees, letting it boil up after each portion is added ; put 
in the meat, and half a pint of sherry, sinuner the whole from 
three to five minutes ; dish the soup, and slip into it two or three 
dozens of delicately fried forcemeat-balls. (See Chapter VI.)

first boils, and throw in a tablespoonM of salt, two onions of 
moderate size, a small head of celery, a bunch of herbs, two 
whole carrots, a small teaspoonfol of white peppercorns, and a 
blade of mace. Stew these softly until the ears and feet are 
perfectly tender, and after they are lifted out, let the liqonr be 
kept jii8t simmerins only, while they are being boned, lliat it 
may not be too mucn reduced. Put the bones back into it, and 
stew them as gently as possible for an hour ; then strain the 
soup into a clean pan, and set it by till the morrow in a cool 
place. The flesh should be cut into dice while it is still warm, 
and covered with the cloth before it becomes quite cold. To 
prepare the soup for table, clear the stock from fat and sediment, 
put it into a very clean stewpan, or deep, well-tinned sauc^>an, 
and stir to it, when it boils, six ounces of the finest rice-flour 
smoothly mixed with a quarter-teaspoonful of cayenne, three 
times as much of mace, and salt, the strained juice of a lemon, 
three tablespoonsful of Harvey's sauce, and half a pint of good 
sherry or Madeira. Simmer the whole for six or eight minutes, 
add more salt if needful, stir the soup often, and skim it tho- 
roughly ; put in the meat, and herbs, and after they have ooiled 
gently for five minutes, dish the soup, add forcemeat and egg- 
balls or not, at pleasure, and send it to table quickly. 

Moderate-sized pigs' feet, 8 ; ears, 4 ; water, 5 quarts ; salt, 1 
tablespoonM ; omons, 2 ; celery, 1 head ; carrots, 2 ; bunch of 
herbs; peppercorns, 1 small teaspoonftil; mace, 1 blade: 3^ 
to 4i hours. Stock, 5 pints ; rice-flour, 6 ozs. ; cayenne, \ 
teaspoonful ; mace and salt, each f of a teaspoonful ; juice of 1 
lemon ; Harvey's sauce, 3 tablespoonsful ; sherry or Madeira, 
i pint : 6 to 8 minutes. Savouiy herbs, 2 tablespoonsful : 5 
minutes. 

Ohs. 1. — Should the quantity of stock exceed five pints, an 
additional ounce or more of rice must be used, and the 
flavouring be altogether increased in proportion. Of the 
minced herbs, two-thirds should be parsley, and the remainder 
equal parts of lemon thyme and winter savoury, unless sweet 
basil should be at hand, when a teaspoonful of it should be 
substituted for half of the parsley. To some tastes a seasoning 
of sage would be acceptable ; and a slice or two of lean ham 
will much improve the flavour of the soup. 

Obs, 2. — Both this soup, and the preceding one, may be 
rendered very rich by substituting strong bouillon (see page 6) 
or good veal broth for water, in making them.

COGOA-IHTT SOUP. 

Pare the dark rind from a very fresh cocoa-nut, and grate it 
fine on an exceedingly clean, bright grater ; weigh it, and allow 
two ounces for each quart of soup. Simmer it gently fbr one 
hour in the stock, which should then be strained and thickened 
for table. This nut imparts a remarkably fine flavour to any 
kind of soup or broth, and it is considerably heightened by 
browning it with a morsel of fresh butter to a fine amber- 
colour, in a thick stewpan or saucepan, over a slow fire, before 
the soup is poured to it. It must be stirred constantly, and the 
greatest care should be taken that no single particle be burned. 
An ounce of butter wiU be sufficient for a quarter-pound of the 
nut, which should be added as soon as the butter is just 
dissolved. 

Veal stock, gravy-soup, or broth, 5 pints ; grated cocoa-nut, 
5 0Z8. : 1 hour. Flour of rice, 5 ozs. ; mace, i teaspoonfiil ; 
little cayenne and salt ; mixed with ^ pint cream, if at hand : 
10 minutes. 

For brov^n soup : butter, 1^ oz. ; cocoa-nut, 5 ozs. : 5 to 10 
minutes. Gravy-soup, or good beef-broth, 5 pints: 1 hour. 
Rice flour, 5 ozs. ; soy and lemon-juice, each 1 tablespoonful ; 
sugar pounded fine, 1 oz. ; cayenne, I teaspoonful ; sherry, 2 
glasses. 

06«. — ^When either cream or wine is objected to for these 
soups, a half-pint of the stock should be reserved to mix the 
thickening witn. 

CHESTNUT SOUP. 

Strip the outer rind from some fincj sound Spanish chestj^uts, 
throw them into a large pan of warm water, and as soon as it 
becomes too hot for the fingers to remain in it, take it from the 
fire, lift out the chestnuts, peel them quickly, and throw them 
into cold water as they are done ; wipe, and weigh them ; take 
three quarters of a pound for each quart of soup, cover them 
with good gravy-stock, and stew them gently for upwards of 
three quarters of an hour, or until they break when touched 
with a fork ; drain, and pound them smoothly, or bruise them 
to a mash with a strong spoon, and press them through a fine 
sieve reversed; mix with them by slow degrees, the proper 
quantity of stock, add sufficient mace, cayenne, and salt, to 
season the soup, and stir it often until it boils. Three quarters 
of a pint of hch cream will greatly improve it. The stock in

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE, OR PALESTDVE SOUP. 

Wash and pare quickly some freshly-dug artichokes, and to 
preserve their colour, throw them into spring- water as they are 
done, but do not let them remain in it aner all are ready. Boil 
three pounds of them in water for ten minutes ; lift them ' out, 
and slice them into three pints of boiling stock; when they have 
stewed gently in this from fifteen to twenty minutes, press them, 
with the soup, through a fine sieve, and put the whole into a 
clean saucepan with a pint and a half more of stock ; add suffi- 
cient salt and cayenne to season it, skim it well, and aiter it has 
simmered two or three minutes, stir it to a pint of rich boiling 
cream. Serve it immediately. 

Artichokes, 3 lbs. boiled in water : 10 minutes. Veal stock, 
3 pints: 15 to 20 minutes. Additional stock, 1^ pint; little 
cayenne and salt : 2 to 3 minutes. Boiling cream, 1 pint. 

Obs, — The palest veal stock, as for white soup, should be used 
for this ; but for a family dinner, or where economy is a consi- 
deration, excellent mutton-broth, made the day before, and per- 
fectly cleared from fat, will answer very well as a substitute ; 
milk, too, may in part take the place of cream, when this last is 
scarce : the proportion of artichokes should then be increased a 
little. 

Vegetable-marrow, when young, makes a superior soup even 
to t\m, which is a most excellent one. It should be well pared, 
trimned, and sliced into a ismall quantity of boiling veal stock, 
or broth, and when perfectly tender, pressed through a fine 
sieve, and mixed wtth more stock, and some cream. In. France, 
the marrow is stewed first in butter, with a large mild onion or 
two, also sliced ; and afterwards in a quart or more of water, 
which is poured graduaMy to it ; it is next passed through a 
tammy,* seasoned with pepper and salt, and mixed with a pint 
or two of milk, and a little cream. 

COMMON CARROT SOUP. 

The easiest way of making this soup is to boil some carrots 
yery tender in water slightly salted; then to pound them 

* Derived from the French tamls, which means a slave or strainer. 



CBAP. I.] SOUPS. 19 

extremely fine, and to mix gradually with them boiling gravy^ 
soup (or bouillon) in the proportion of a quart to twelve ounces 
of the carrot. The soup should then be passed through a 
strainer, seasoned with salt and cayenne, and served very hot, 
with fried bread in a separate dish. K only the red outsides of 
the carrot be used, the colour of the soup will be very bright : 
they should be weighed after they are pounded. Turnip soup 
may also be made in the same manner. 

Soup,^'2 quarts; pounded carrot, 1^ lb.; salt, cayenne: 5 
mmutes.* 

A FINER CARROT SOUP. 

Scrape very clean, and cut away any blemishes from some 
highly-flavoured red carrots ; wash, and wipe them dry. Cut 
them in quarter-inch slices. Put into a large stewpan three 
omices of the best butter, and when it is melted, add two pounds 
of the sliced carrots, and let them stew gently for an hour with- 
out browning ; pour to them then four pints and a half of brown 
gravy-soup, and virhen" they have simmered from fifty minutes 
to au hour, they ought to be sufficiently tender. Press them 
through a sieve or strainer with the soup ; add salt, and cayenne 
if quired ; boil the whole gently for five minutes, take off all 
the scum, and serve the soup as hot as possible. Send it to 
table with a dish of bread, cut in dice, and fried. 

Butter 3 ozs. ; carrots 2 lbs. : 1 hour. Soup 4^ pints : 50 to 
60 minutes. Salt, cayenne : 5 minutes. 

06«.— Three ounces of Scotch, or of pearl barley, soaked for 
oue night, and stewed slowly the next day for an hour and a 
half, in a quart of broth, then mixed with common carrot soup, 
^1 make what is considered, by many persons, an excellent 
potage. 

A fiishionable varietv of this soup is also made by diminishing 
a little the quantity ol carrots, and adding to it three ounces of 
rice previously swelled in broth till tender. 

COMMON TURNIP SOUP. 

Wash and wipe the turnips, pare and weigh them; allow a 
pound and a half lor every quart of soup. Cut them in slices 
about a^ quarter of an inch thick. Melt four ounces.of butter 
in a clean stewpan, and put in the turnips before it begins to 
boil ; stew them gently for three quarters of an hour, taking 
care that they shall not brown. Then have the proper quantity 
of soup ready boiling, pour it to them, and let them simmer in 
it for three quarters of an hour. Pulp the whole through a 



20 MODERN COOKERT. [^CHAP. I. 

coarse sieve or soup-strainer, put it again on the fire, keep it 
stirred until it has boiled three minutes, take off the scum, add 
salt and pepper, if required, and serve it very hot. 

Turnips 3 lbs. ; butter 4 ozs. : | hour. Soup 2 quarts : | 
hour. Last time : 3 minutes. 

A QUICKIiT MADE TURNIP SOUP. 

Pare and slice into three pints of veal or mutton stock, or of 
good broth, three pounds of young mild turnips ; stew them 
gently from twenty-five to thirty mmutes, or until they can be 
reduced quite to pulp ; press the whole through a sieve, add to 
it another quart of stock, a seasoning of salt, white pepper, and 
one lump of sugar ; simmer it a minute or two, skim and serve 
it. A large white onion, when the flavour is liked, may be 
sliced and stewed with the turnips. A little cream improves 
much the colour of this soiip. 

Turnips, 3 lbs. ; soup, 5 pints : 25 to 30 minutes. 

POTATO SOUP. 

Mash to a smooth paste three pounds of good mealy potatoes, 
which have been steamed, or boiled veiy dry; mix with them 
by de^ees, two quarts of boiling broth, pass the soup through 
a stramer, set it again on the fire, add pepper and salt, and let 
it boil five minutes. Take off entirely tne black scum that will 
rise upon it, and serve it very hot with fried or toasted bread. 
"^^Tiere the flavour is approved, two ounces of onions, minced 
and fried a light brown, may be added to the soup, and stewed 
in it for ten minutes before it is sent to table. 

Potatoes, 3 lbs. ; broth, 2 quarts : 5 minutes. (With onions, 
2 ozs. :) 10 minutes. 

APPLE SOUP. 

(JSoupe d la Bourguignotu) 

Clear the fat from five pints of good mutton-broth, bouillon, 
or shin of beef stock, and strain, it through a fine sieve ; add to 
it, when it boils, a pound and a half of good pudding apples, 
and stew them* down in it very softly, to a smooth pulp ; press 
the whole through a strainer, add a small teaspoonful of pow- 
dered ginger, and plenty of pepper, simmer the soup for a couple 
of minutes, skim^ and serve it very hot, accompanied by a dish 
of rice, boiled as for curries. 

Broth, 5 pints ; apples, 1 1 lb. : 25 to 40 minutes. Ginger, 1 
teaspoonful ; pepper, I teaspoonful : 2 minutes.

PABSNEP SOUP. 

, Dissolve, over a gentle fire, four ounces and a half of good 
bntter, in a wide stewpan or saucepan, and slice in directly two 
pounds of sweet tender pansneps ; let them stew very softly until 
all are tender, then pour in gradually sufficient veal stock, or 
good broth to cover tnem, and boil the whole slowly from twenty 
minutes to half an hour; press it with a wooden spoon through 
a fine sieve, add as much stock as will make two quarts m all, 
season the soup with salt and white pepper, or cayenne, give it 
one boil, skim, and serve it very hot Send pale fried sippets 
to table with it. 

Butter, 4i ozs. ; parsneps, 2 lbs. : § hour, or more. Stock, 1 
quart ; 20 to 30 minutes ; 1 full quart more of stock ; pepper, 
^t : 1 minute. 

Obs, — ^We can particularly recommend this soup to those who 
like the pecuUar flavour of the vegetable. 

AHOTHES PABSNEP SOUP. 

Slice into five pints of boiling veal stock or strong colourless 
broth, a couple or pounds of parsneps, and stew them as gently as 
possible from thirty minutes to an hour ; when they are perfectly 
tender, press them through a sieve, strain the soup to them, 
fieason, boil, and serve it very hot. With the addition of cream, 
rannep soup made by this receipt resembles in appearance the 
ralestme soup. 

Veal stock or broth, 5 pints ; parsneps, 2 lbs. : 30 to 60 mi- 
nutes. Salt and cayenne : 2 minutes. 

WESTEBFIELD WHITE SOUP. 

Break the bone of a knuckle of veal in one or two places, and 
pat it on to stew, with three quarts of cold water to the five 
pounds of meat ; when it has been quite cleared from scum, add 
to it an ounce and a half of salt, two ounces and a half of onions, 
twenty corns of white pepper, and two or three blades of mace, 
with a lilile cayenne pepper. When the soup is reduced one 
third by slow sunmerin^, strain it off, and set it by till cold ; 
then free it carefully uoia the fat and sediment, and heat it 
a^in in a very clean stewpan. Mix with it when it boils, a pint 
01 thick cream smoothly blended with an ounce of good arrow- 
loot, two ounces of very fresh vermicelli previously boiled ten- 
der in water slightly auted and well-drained from it, and an 



22 MODERN COOKBRY. {CHAP. T. 

ounce and a half of almonds blanched, and cut in strips f give 
it one minute^s sinuner, and serve it immediately, with a French 
roll in the tureen. 

Veal, 5 lbs. ; water, 3 quarts ; salt, 1^ oz. ; onions, 2^ ozs. ; 
20 corns white pepper ; 2 large blades of mace : 5 hours ot 
mm'e. Cream, 1 pint; almonds, 1^ oz. ; yermicelli, 1 oz. : 1 
minute. Little thickening, if needed. 

Obs. — Cream should always be boiled for a few minutes be- 
fore it is added to any soup. The yolks of two or three very 
fresh eggs beaten well, and mixed with half a pint of the boiling 
soup, may be stirred into the whole, after it is taken from the 
fire. Some persons put the eggs into the tureen, and add the 
soup to them by degrees ; but tms is not so well. If a superior 
white soup to this be wanted, put three quarts of water to seven 
pounds of veal, and half a poimd of the lean part of a ham ; ot^ 
instead of water, use very clear, weak veal broth. Grated Par- 
mesan cheese should be handed roimd the table when white oir 
maccaroni soup is served. 

A BICHEB WHITE SOUP. 

Found very fine indeed six ounces of sweet almonds, then 
add to them six ounces of the breasts of roasted chickens or par- 
tridges, and three ounces of the whitest bread which has been 
soaked in a little veal broth, and squeezed very dry in a cloth. 
Beat these altogether to an extremely smooth paste ; then pour 
to them boiling and by degrees, two quarts of rich veal stock ; 
strain the soup through a fine hair sieve, set it again over the 
fire, add to it a pint of thick cream, and serve it, as soon as it is 
at the point of boiling, with a French roll in the tureen. When 
cream is very scarce, or not easily to be procured, this soup may 
be thickened sufficiently without it, by increasing the quantity 
of almonds to eight or ten ounces, and pouring to 'them, after 
they have been reduced to the finest paste, a pint of boiling 
stock, which must be again wrung from them through a coarse 
cloth with very strong pressure : the proportion of meat and 
bread also should then be nearly doubled. The stock should be 
well seasoned with mace and cayenne before it is added to the 
other ingredients. 

* We have given this receipt without any rariation from the original, at the 
soup made exactly by it was much approved by the guests of the hospitable . 
country gentleman, at whose elegant table it was served often for many years ; 
but we would rather recommend that the almonds should be pounded, or merely 
blanched, cut in spikes, stuck into the cramb of a French roll, and put into this 
tureen, simply to give flavour to the soup* 



CHAP. I.^ SOUPS. 23 

Almonds, 6 ozs. ; breasts of chickens or partridges, 6 ozs. ; 
soaked bread, 3 ozs. ; yeal stock, 2 quarts ; cream, 1 pint. 

Obs. — Some persons pour the yolks of four or five hard- 
boiled eggs with the almonds, meat, and bread, fur this white 
soup ; l^nch cooks beat smoothly with them an ounce or two 
of whole rice, previously boiled m>m fifteen to twenty minutes. 

Obs. — A good plain white soup may be made simply by 
adding to a couple of quarts of pole veal stock or strong well 
flavoured veal broth, a thickening of arrow-root, and ^m half 
to three quarters of a pint of creauL Four oimces of maccaroni 
boiled tender and well drained may be slipped into it a minute 
or two before it is dished, but the thickemng may then be dimi- 
nished a little. 

MOCK TUSTIiE SOUP. 

To make a single tureen of this favourite English soup in the 
most economical manner, when there is no stock at hand, stew 
gently down in a gallon of water four pounds of the fleshy part 
of the shin of bee^ or of the neck, if more convenient, with two 
or three carrots, one onion« a small head of celery, a bunch of 
savouiy herbs, a blade of mace, a half-teaspoonml of pepper- 
corns, and an oimce of salt. When the meat is quite in frag- 
ments, strain off the broth, and pour it when cold upon three 
pounds of the knuckle, or of the neck of veal ; simmer this until 
the flesh has quite fallen &6m the bones, but be careful to stew 
it as softly as possible, or the quantity of stock will be so much 
redact as to be insuflicient for the soup. Next, take the half 
of a fine cairs head unth the skin on, remove the brains, and 
and then bone it* entirely, or let the butcher be requested to do 
this, and to return the bones with it : these, when there is time» 
may be stewed with the veal, to enrich the stock, or boiled after- 
wards with the head and tongue. Strain the soup through a 
hair-sieve into a clean pan, and let it drain closely from the 
meat When it is nearly or quite cold, clear off all tne fiit from 
it; roll the head lightly round, leaving the tongue inside, or 
taking it out as is most convenient, secure it with tape or twine, 
poor the soup over, and bring it ^ntly to boil upon a moderate 
fire ; keep it well skinmied, and sunmer it from an hour to an 
hour and a quarter ; then lift the head into a deep pan or tureen, 

* This is 80 ■iinple and easy a process, that the cook may readily accomplish 
it with Tery little attention. Let her only work the knife close to the bond 
slwaysi so as to take the flesh clean from it, instead of leaving large fragment 
00. Tbe Jaw-bone may first be removed, and the flesh turned back firom the edgo 
<tf the other. 



24 MODERN COOKERY. [[CHAF. T. 



add the soup to it, and let it remain in until two parts cold, 
this will prevent the edges from becoming dark. Cut into 
quarter-inch slices, and then divide into dice, from six to eight 
ounces of the lean of an undressed ham, and if possible, one of 
good flavour ] 'free it perfectly from fat, rind, and the smoked 
edges ; peel and slice four moderate sized eschalots, or if these 
should not be at hand, one mild onion in lieu of them. Dissolve 
in a well-tinned stewpan, or thick iron saucepan which holds a 
gallon or more, four ounces of butter ; put in the ham and 
eschalots, or onion, with half a dozen cloves, two middling sized 
blades of mace, a half-teaspoon|ul of peppercorns, three or four 
very small sprigs of thyme, three teaspoonsful of minced parsley, 
one of lemon thyme and winter savoury mixed, and when the 
flavour is thought appropriate, the very thm rind of half a 
small fresh lemon. Stew these as sofrly as possible for nearly 
or quite an hour, and keep the pan frequently shaken ; then put 
into a dredging box two oimces of fine dry flour and ^prinKle 
it to them by degrees ; mix the whole well together, and alter a 
few minutes more of gentle simmering, add very gradually five 
full pints of the stocK taken free of &i and semment, and made 
boiling before it is poured in ; shake the pan strongly round as 
the first portions of it are added, and continue to do so until it 
contains from two to three .pints, when the remainder may be 
poured in at once, and the pan placed by the side of the fire that 
it may boil in the gentlest manner for an hour. At the end of 
that time turn the whole into a hair-sieve placed over a large 
■j^n, and if the liquid should not run through freely, knock the 
sides of the sieve, but do not force it through with a spoon, as 
that would spoil the appearance of the stock. The head in the 
mean while should have been cut up, ready to add to it. For 
the finest kind of mock turtle, only the ^n, ynth the fat that 
adheres to it should be "used ; and this, ynth the tongue, should 
be cut down into one inch squares^ or if preferred, into strips of an 
inch wide. For ordinary occasions, the lean, part of the flesh 
may be added also, but as it is always sooner done than the skin, 
it is better to add it to the soup a little later. When it is quite 
ready, put it with the strain^ stock into a clean pan, and sim- 
mer it from three quarters of an hour to a full hour: it should 
be perfectly tender, without being allowed to break. Cayenne, 
if needed, should be thrown into the stock before it is strained ; 
, salt should be used sparingly, on account of the ham, until the 
whole of the other ingredients have been mixed together, when 
a sufiUcient quantity must be stirred into the soup to season it 
properly. A couple of glasses of good sherry or Madeira, with 



cHiP. I.] SOUPS. 25 

8 dessertspoonM of strained lemon-juice are nsoally added two 
or three minutes only before the soup is dished,' that the spirit 
and flavour of the wine may not have time to evaporate ; but it 
is sometimes preferred mellowed down by longer boiling. The 
proportion of lemon-juice may be doubled at will, but much add 
is not generally liked. We can assure the reader of the excel- 
lence of the soup made by this receipt : it is equally palatable 
and delicate, and not heavy or cloying to the stomach, Ime many 
of the elaborate compositions which bear its name. The fat, 
through the whole process, should be carefully skimmed off. 
The ham gives far more savour, when used as we have directed, 
than when, even in much larger proportions, it is boiled down in 
the stock. Two dozens of forcemeat balls, prepared by the 
receipt No. 1 1, Chap. YI., should be slipped into the soup when 
it is ready for table. It is no longer customary to serve egg* 
halls in it. 

First broth : — shin, or neck of beef, 4 lbs. ; v^ter, 4 quarts ; 
carrots, 2 or 3 ; large mild onion, 1 ; celery, small head; bunch 
saToury herbs; mace, 1 large blade; peppercorns, ^ teaspoonfiil;

the broth and 3 lbs. neck or knuckle of veal (bones of head if 
readj) : 4 to 5 hours. Boned half-head with skin on and

Obs. 1. — The bee^ veal, bones t>f the head, and vegetables 
may be stewed down together when more convenient : it is only 
necessaiy that a really good, well-flavoured, and rather deeply- 
coloured stock should be prepared. A calfs foot is always an 
advantageous addition to it, and the skin of another calTs head* 
a better one still. 

* Coantry batcben, in preparing a calfs head for sale in tbe ordinary way take 
off the skin (or scalp), considered so essentia to the excellence of this soup, and 
frequently throw it away ; it may, tlierefore, often be procured from them at 
▼ery slight cost, and is the b«>st possible addition to the mock turtle. It it 
clearad from the head in detached portions with tbe hair on, but this may easily 
be remored after a ffew minutt^s' scalding as flrom the head itself or the feet, by 
flie dizectlon given in Chap. IX. 



26 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. 

Obs, 2. — A couple of dozen musliroom-bTittons, cleaned with 
salt and flannel, tnen wiped very dry, and sliced, and added to 
the ham and herbs, when they have been simmered together 
about half an hour, will be found a great improvement to 
the soup ; but when they are not procurable, a pleasant flavour 
may be imparted to it by substituting two or three fresh bay- 
leaves. 

Obs. 3. — Claret is sometimes added to this soup instead of 
sherry or Madeira, but we do not think it would in general suit 
English taste so well. From two to three tablespoonsful of 
Harvey's sauce can be stirred in with the wine when it is liked, 
or when the colour requires deepening. 

OLD-FASHIONED MOCK TUBTLE. 

After having taken out the brain and washed and soaked the 

head well, pour to it nine quarts of cold water, bring it gently 

to boil, skim it very clean, boil it, if large, an hour and a half, 

lift it out, and put into the liquor eight pounds of neck of beef, 

lightly browned in a little fresh butter, with three or four thick 

slices, or a knuckle of lean ham, four larse onions sliced, three 

heads of celery, three large' carrots, a large bunch of sweet 

herbs, the rind of a lemon pared very thin, a dessertspoonful of 

pepper-corns, two ounces of salt, and after the meat has been 

taken from the head, all the bones and fragments. Stew these 

gently from seven to eight hours, then strain off the stock, and 

set it into a very cool place, th^it the fat may become firm 

enough on the top to be cleared off easily. The skin and fat of 

the head should be taken off together and divided into strips of 

two or three inches in length, and one in width ; the tongue 

may be cut in the same manner, or into dice. Put the stock, of 

which there ought to be between four and five quarts, into a 

large soup or stew pot: thicken it when it bous with four 

oimces of fresh butter* mixed with an equal weight of fine diy 

flour, a half-teaspoonful of pounded mace, and a third as mucn 

cf cayenne (it is better to use these sparingly at first, and to 

add more should the soup require it, after it has boiled some 

Httle time) ; pour in hsdf a pint of sherry, stir the whole 

together until it has simmered for a minute or two, then put in 

the head, and let it stew gently ^om an hour and a quarter to

salt, white pepper, a Dtde grated nutmeg, fine lemon-rind, and 
chopped parsley fried a fine brown, well drained and dried; and 
as many egg-balls, the size of a small marble, as the yolks of 
four eggs will supply. (See Chapter VI.) This quantity will 
be sufficient for two large tureens of soup ; when the whole is 
not wanted for table at the same time, it is better to add wine 
only to so much as will be required for immediate eonsumption, 
or if it cannot conveniently be divided, to heat the wine in a 
small saucepan with a little of the soup, to turn it into the 
tureen, and then to mix it with the remainder by stirring the 
whole gently after the tureen is filled. Some persons smipl^ 
put in the cold wine just before the soup is dished, but this is 
not so well. 

Whole calf*s head with skin on, boiled li hour. Stock:

balls, 36 ; the brain cut and fried ; egg-balls, 16 to 24. 

Obs. — ^When the brain is not blanched it must be cut thinner 
in the form of small cakes, or it will not be done through by the 
time it has taken enough colour : it may be altogether omitted 
without much detriment to the soup, and will make an excellent 
comer dish, if gently stewed in white gravy for half an hour, 
and served with it thickened with cream and arrow-root, to the 
consistency of good white sauce, then rather highly seasoned, 
and mixed wim plenty of chopped parsley, and some lemon- 
juice.

by for use. .Take out the bone from half a calf 's head with 
the skin on (the butcher will do this if desired), wash, roll, and 
bind it with a bit of tape or twine, and lay it into a stewpot, 
with the bones and tongue ; cover the whole with the beef 
stock, and stew it for an hour and a half; then lift it into a 
deep earthen pan and let it cool in the liquor, as this will 
prevent the edges from beinjg dry or discoloured. Take it out 
before it is quite cold ; strain, and skim all the &.t carefully 
from the stock ; heat five pints in a lar^e clean saucepan, witn 
the head cut into small thick slices or mto inch-squares. As 
quite the whole will not be needed, leave a portion of the fat, 
but add every morsel of the skin to the soup, and of the tongue 
also. Should the first of these not be perfectly tender, it must 
be simmered gently till it is so ; then stir into the soup frx>m six 
to eight ounces of fine rice-flour mixed with a quarter-teaspoon- 
frd of cayenne, twice as much freshly pounded mace, half a 
wineglassful of mushroom catsup, and sufficient cold broth or 
water to render it of the consistency of batter.; boil the whole 
from eight to ten minutes ; take off the scum, and throw in two 
glasses of sherry; dish the soup and slip into the tureen some 
delicately fried, and well dried forcemeat-balls made by the 
receipt No, 1, 2, or 3 of Chapter VI. A small quantity of 
lemon-juice or other acid can be added at pleasure. The wine 
and forcemeat-balls may be omitted, and the other seasonings of 
the soup a little heightened. As much salt as may be required 
should be added to the stock when the head first begins to boil 
in it : the cook must regulate also by the taste the exact pro- 
portion of cayenne, mace, and catsup, which will flavour the 
soup agreeably. The fragments of the head, with the bones 
and the residue of the beef used for stock, if stewed down 
together with some water and a few fresh vegetables, will 
am>rd some excellent broth, such as would be highly acceptable, 
especially if well thickened with rice, to many a poor fiunily 
during the winter months.

Ovy obiter Soup a la Reme* 

When the oysters are small, from two to three dozens for each 

Eint of soup should be prepared, but this number can, of course, 
e diminished or increased at pleasure. Let the fish (which 
should be finely conditioned natives) be opened carefully ; pour 
the liquor firom them, and strain it ; rinse them in it well, and 
beard them ; strain the liquor a second time through a lawn- 
sieve or folded muslin, and pour it again over the oysters. 
Take a portion from two quarts of the palest veal stock, and 
simmer the beards in it from twenty to thirty minutes. Heat 
the soup, flavour it well with mace and cayenne, and strain the 
stock from the oyster-beards into it. Plump the fish in their 
own liquor, but do not let them boil ;»pour the liquor to the 
soup, and add to it a pint of boiling cream ; put the oysters into 
the tureen, dish the soup, and send it to table quicklv. Should 
any thickening be reqmred, stir briskly to the stocK an ounce 
and a half of arrow-root, ground very smooth in a mortar, and 
carefully mixed with a little milk or cream ; or, in lieu of this^ 
when a rich soup is liked, thicken it with four ounces of fresh 
butter well blended with three of flour.

BABBIT SOUP A LA BEINE. 

Wash and soak thoroughly three young rabbits, put them 
whole into the soup-pot, and pour on them seven pints of cold 
water, or of clear veal broth ; when they have stewed gently 
about three quarters of an hour, lift them out, and take off the 
flesh of the backs, with a little from the legs, should there not 
be half a pound of the former ; strip off the skin, mince the 
meat very small, and pound it to the smoothest paste ; cover it 
from the air, and set it by. Put back into the soup the bodies 
of the rabbits, with two mild onions of moderate ^ze, a head of 
celery, three carrots, a faggot of savoUry herbs, two blades of 
mace, a half-teaspoonM of peppercorns, and an ounce of salt. 
Stew the whole softly about four hours, strain it off, let it stand 
to settle, pour it gently from the sediment, put from four to five 
pints into a clean stewpan, and mix it very gradually while hot,

with the pounded rabbit-flesh : this must be done with care, for 
if the liqiiid be not added in very small portions at first, the 
meat will gather into lumps, and will not easily be worked 
smooth afterwards. Add as much pounded mace and cayenne 
as will season the soup pleasantly, and pass it through a coarse 
but very clean sieve ; wipe out the stewpan, put ba« the soup 
into it, and stir in when it boils, a pint and a quarter of gooa 
cream, mixed with a tablespoonful of the best airow-root:

pints of boiling water, throw in a large teaspoonSil of salt, dear 
off all the scum with care as it rises, and then put to the soup a 
laggot of parsley, four not very large carrots, and a small tea-

hours from the time of its first beguming to boil, and more, 
if the hare be old. Strain the soup and pound together very 
fine the slices of ham and all the flesh of the back, l^s, and 
shoulders of the hare, and put this meat into a stewpan with the 
liquor in which it was boiled, the crumb of two French rolls, 
and half a pint of port wine. Set it on the stove to simmer 
twenty minutes ; then rub it through a sieve, place it again on the 
stove till very hot, but do not let it boil ; season it with salt and 
cayenne, and send it to table directly. 

Hare, 1 ; ham, 12 to 16 ozs ; onions, .3 to 6 ; mace, 3 blades; 
fiaggot of savoury herbs ; beef stock, 3 quarts : 2 hours. Crumb 
of 2 rolls ; port wine, ^ pint ; little salt and cayenne : 20 mi- 
nutes. 

A LESS EXPENSIVE HARE SOUP.* 

Pour on two pounds of neck or shin of beef, and a hare well 
washed and carved into joints, one gallon of cold water, and 
when it boils and has been thoroughly skimmed, add an ounce 
and a half of salt, two onions, ont large head of celery, three 
moderate-sized carrots, a teaspoonM of black peppercorns, and 
tax cloves. 

Let these stew vety gently for three hours, or longer, should 
the hare not be perfectly tender. Then take up the principal 
joints, cut the meat from them, mince, and pound it to a fine 
paste, with the cnmib of two penny rolls (or two ounces of the 
crumb of household bread), that has been soaked in a little of 
the boiling soup, and then pressed very dry in a cloth ; strain, 
and mix smoothly with it, the stock from the remainder of the 
hare ; pass the soup through a strainer, season it with cayenne, 
and serve it when at the point of boiling : if not sufllciently 
thick, add to it a tablespoonml of arrow-root, moistened with a 
little cold broth, and let the soup simmer for an instant after- 
wards. Two or three glasses of port wine, and two dozens of 
small forcemeat balls, are sometimes added to this soup with 
very good effect. 

Beef, 2 lbs. ; hare, 1 ; water, 1 gallon ; salt, 1| oz. ; onions, 
2 ; celery, 1 head ; carrots, 3 ; bunch savoury herbs ; pepper- 
corns, 1 teaspoonfiil ; cloves, 6 : 3 hours, or more. Bread, 2

rather thickly when they are first laid to the fire. As soon as 
thej are nearly cold take all the flesh from the hreasta, put it 
aside, and keep it covered from the air ; carve down tne re- 
mamder of the birds into joints, bruise the bodies thoroughly, 
and stew the whole gently from two to three hours in five pints 
of strong beef broth ; tnen strain off the soup, and press as 
much of it as possible from the pheasants. Let it cool, and in 
the mean time strip the skin frx)m tlie breasts, mince them small^ 
and pound them to the finest paste, with> half as much fiiesh 
butter, and half of dry crumbs of bread ; season these well with 
cayenne, sufficiently with' salt, and moderately with pounded 
mace, and grated nutm^, and add, when their flavour is liked^ 
three or four eschalots, previously boiled tender in a little of the 
soup, left till cold, and minced before they are put into the 
mortar ; moisten the mixture with the yolks of two or three 
eggs, roll it into small balls of equal size, dust a little flour upon 
them, skim all the fat from the soup, heat it in a dean stewpan, 
and when it boils throw them in and poach them from ten to 
twelve minutes, but first ascertain that the soup is properly sea- 
soned with salt and cayenne. Minced savoury herbs, and even 
grated lemon-rind, would perhaps to English taste improve the 
forcemeat, as well as a small portion of lean ham, a thick slice 
of which might be stewed in the soup for the purpose. We 
have reconmiended that the birds should be partially roasted 
before they are put into the soup-pot, because their flavour is 
much finer when this is done than wnen they are simply stewed ; 
they should be placed rather near to a brisk fire tnat they be 
quickly browned on the surface, without losing any of their 
jnices, and the basting should be constant. A slight thickening 
of rice-flour or arrow-root can be added to the soup at pleasure, 
and the forcemeat-balls may be fried and slipped into the tureen 
when they are preferred so. Half a dozen eschalots lightly 
browned m butter, and a small head of celery may also lie 
thrown in afrer the birds begin to stew, but nothing should be 
allowed to prevail over the natural flavour of the game itself; 
and this should be observed equally with other kinds, as par- 
tridges, grouse, and venison. 

Pheasants, 2 : roasted 20 to 30 minutes. Strong beef broth, 
or stock, 5 pints: 2 to 3 hours. Forcemeat-balls: breasts of 
pheasant^ half as much of dry bread-crumbs and of butter, salt, 
mace, cayenne ; yolks of 2 or 3 eggs (and at choice 3 or 4 boiled 
eschalots).

onion, a large carrot, a bunch of sayoury herbs, and some salt 
and spice should be added to it : one pound of neck of veal or of 
beef will improve it 

AVOTHEB PHEASANT SOUP* 

Boil down the half-roasted birds as directed in the foregoing 
receipt, and add to the soup^ after it is strain^ and re-heate^ 
the breasts pounded to the finest paste with nearly as much 
bread soaked in a little of the stock and pressed very dry; for 
the proper manner of mixing them, see Fotage k la Keine, page 
29. Half a pint of small mushrooms cleaned as for pickling, 
then sliced rather thickly, and stewed from ten to fifteen 
minutes, without browning, in an ounce or two of fresh batter, 
with a slight seasoning of mace, cayenne, and salt, then turned 
into the mortar and pounded with the otiier ingredients, will be 
found an excellent addition to the soup, which must be passed 
through a strainer after the breasts are added to it, brought to 
the point of boiling, and served with sippets k la Heine, or 
with others simply fried of a delicate brown and well dried. 
We have occasionally had a small (quantity of delicioiis soup 
made with the remains of birds which have been served at 
table ; and where game is frequently dressed, the cook, by 
reserving all the migments for the purpose, and combining 
different kinds, may onen send up a good tlireen of such, made 
at a very slight cost. 

Pheasants, 2; stock, 6 pints; bread soaked in gravy (see 
Panada, Chapter VI.), nearly as much in bulk as the flesh of 
the breasts of the bu*ds ; mushrooms, ^ pint, stewed in 1 or 2 
ozs. of butter 10 to 15 minutes, then pounded with flesh of 
pheasants. Salt, cayenne, and mace, to season properly. 

PABTBIDGE SOUP. 

This is, we think, superior in flavour to the pheasant soup. 
It should be made in predselv the same manner, but three 
birds allowed for it instead or two. Grouse and partridges 
together will make a still finer one : the remains of roast grouse 
even, added to a brace of partridges, wiU produce a very good 
effect.

then brown lightly in it a yonng rabbit, or the prime joints of 
two, or a fowl cut down small, and floured. When the meat is 
sufficiently browned, lay it upon the onions, pour gradually to 
them a quart of good boiling stock, and stew it gently m>m 
three Quarters of an hour to an hour ; then take it out, and 
press tne stock and onions through a fine sieve or stminer. 
Add to them two pints and a half more of stock, pour the whole 
into a dean pan, and when it boils stir to it two heaped table* 
spoonsful of currie-powder mixed with nearly^ as mudi of 
browned flour, and a little cold water or broth ; put it in the 
meat, and simmer it for twenty minutes or longer should it not 
be per&ctly tender; add the juice of a small lemon just befote it 
is dished, serve it very hot, and send boiled rice to table with it. 
Fart of a pickled mango is sometimes stewed in this soup, and* 
is much recommended by persons who have been long resident 
in India. We have given here the sort of receipt commonly 
used in England for mullagatawny, but a much finer soup may 
be made by departing from it in some respects. The onions, of 
which the proportion may be increased or diminished to the 
taste, after bemg fried slowly, and with care, that no part 
ahould be overdone, may be stewed for an hour in the first 
quart of stock with three or four ounces of mted cocoa-nut, 
which wiU impart a rich mellow flavour to the whole. After 
all of this that can be rubbed through the sieve has been added 
to as much stock as will be required tor the soup, and the currie- 
powder and thickening have boiled in it for twenty minutes, the 
flesh of part of a calf s head previously stewed almost suffi- 
ciently, and cut as for mock turtle, with a sweetbread also 
stewed or boiled in broth tolerably tender, and divided into 
inch-squares, will mftke an admirable mullagatawny, if sim- 
mered in the stock until they have taken the flavour of the 
corrie-seasoning. The flesh of a couple of calves' feet, with a 
sweetbread or two, may, when more convenient, be substituted 
for the head. A large cupful of thick cream, first mixed and 
boiled with a teaspoonful of flour or arrow-root to prevent its 
curdling, and stirred into the soup before the lemon-jidce, will 
enrich and improve it much.

Obs. 2. — Three or four pounds of a breast of veal, or an equal 
weight of mutton, free from bone and fat, may take the place of 
rabbits or fowls in this soup, for a plain diimer. The veal should, 
be cut into squares of an inch and a half, or into strips of an 
inch in width, and two in length ; and the mutton should be 
trimmed down in the same wav, or into very small cutlets. 

Obs, 3. — For an elegant table, the joints of rabbit or of fowl 
should always be boned before thev are added to the soup, for 
which, in this case, a couple of eacn will be needed for a single 
tureen, as aU the inferior joints must be rejected. 

TO BOIL BICE FOB MULLAGATAWmT SOUPS, OB FOB CUBBIES. 

The Patna, or small-srained rice, which is not so good as the 
Carolina for the general purposes of cookery, is the sort which 
ought to be served with currie. First take out the unhusked 
grains, then wash the rice in two or three diflerent waters, and 
put it into a large quantity of cold ; bring it gently to boil, 
keeping it imcovered, and boil it softly for fifteen minutes, when 
it ¥011 be perfectly tender, and everv grain will remain distinct. 
Throw it mto a large cullender, and let it drain for ten minutes 
near the fire ; shomd it not then appear quite dry, turn it into 
a dish, and set it for a short time mto a gentle oven, or let it 
steam in a clean saucepan near the fire. It should neither be 
stirred, except just at first, to prevent its lumping while it is 
still quite hard, nor touched with either fork or spoon ; the 
stewpan may be shaken occasionally, should the rice seem to 
reqmre it, and it should be thrown hghUv from the cullender 
upon the dish. A couple of minutes before it is done, throw 
in some salt, and from the time of its beginning to boil, remove 
the scum as it rises.

tried, and they have been very numerous, is indispatably the 
best. The Carolina rice even answers, well dressed, in this way. 
One or two mmutes, more or less, wiU sometimes, from the 
Taiying quality of the grain, be requisite to render it tender.

(^Not SO good as the preceding one,') 

Wash the rice thoroughly in several waters, and soak it for 
an hoar ; drain and throw it into a huge quantity of fast-bofl- 
ing water. Leave it uncovered, take off the scum, and add salt 
when it is nearly done. When it has boiled from fifteen to 
eighteen minutes, drain it well, heap it lightly in a dish, And 
place it in a gentle oven to dry. 

. Obs. — Rice is of fiu: better flavour when cooked in so much 
Water only as it will absorb ; but it cannot then so easily be 
rendered dry enough to serve with currie, or with curried soups. 
One pint of rice, washed and soaked for a few minutes, then 
Driped very dry, and dropped by degrees into five half pints of 
water, which should bou quickly, and continue to do so, while 
.the rice is being added, and for a minute afterwards, and then 
placed over the ^le, that it may stew vety softly for half an 
nour, or until it is tender, and as dry as it will become without 
beinff -burned, will be found very eood. The addition of a 
cou^ of ounces of firesh butter, when it is nearly done, will 
convert it into a very palatable dish of itself. 

VEGETABUB MUXXAOATAWITr. 

Dissolve in a large stewpan, or thick iron saucepan, four 
oonoes of batter, and when it is on the point of brownmg, throw 
in four large mild onions sliced, three pounds weight oi young 
vegetable marrow, cut in large dice, and cleared from the skin 
and seeds, ft>ur large, or six moderate sized cucumbers, pared, spHt, 
and emptied likewise of their seeds, and from three to six large 
acid apples, according to the taste ; shake the pan often, and 
stew ^ese over a gentle fire until they are tolerably tender ; 
then strew lightly over, and mix well amon^ them, three 
heaped tablespoonsftil of mild currie powder, with nearly a third 
as much of salt, and let the vegetables stew from twenty to thhiy 
minutes longer ; then pour to them gradually sufficient boiling 
water (broth or stock if preferred), to just cover them, and when 
they axe reduced almost to a pulp press the whole through a 
hair-sieve with a wooden spoon, and heat it in a dean ste^^n, 
with as much additional liquid as will make two quarts with 
thttt which was fij^ added. Give any farther fiavouring that

may be needed, whether of salt, cayenne, or acid, and serve the 
soup exti^mely hot. Should any butter appear on the surface, 
let it be carefully skinuned off, or stir in a small dessertspoonful 
of arrow-root (smoothly mixed with a little cold broth or water) 
to absorb it. Kice may be served with this soup at pleasure, 
but as it is of the consistency of winter peas soup, it scarcely 
requires any addition. The currie powder may be altogether 
omitted f(H* variety, and the whole converted into a plain v^e- 
table potage ; or it may be rendered one of high savour, by 
browning all the vegetables lightly, and adding to them rich 
brown stock. Tomatas, when m season, may be substituted for 
the apples, after being divided, and freed from their seeds. 

Butter, 4 ozs. ; ve^table marrow, pared and scooped, 3 lbs. ; 
lai^ nuld onions, 4 ; large cucumbers, 4; or middling-sized, 6 ; 
apples, or tomatas, 3 to 6 : 30 to 40 minutes. Mud currie- 
powder, 3 heaped tablespoonsful ; salt, one small tablespoonAil : 
20 to 32 minutes. Water, broth, or good stock, 2 quarts. 

CUCUMBER SOUP. 

Pare, split, and empty from eight to twenty* fine, well 
grown, but not old cucumbers, — those which have the fewest 
seeds are best for the purpose ; throw a little salt over thenn, 
and leave them for an hour to drain, then put them with the 
white part only of a couple of mild onions, into a deep stewpan, 
or deucately clean saucepan, cover them nearly half an inch 
with pale, but good veal stock, and stew them gently until they 
are perfectly tender, which will be in from three quarters of an 
hour to an hour and a quarter ; press the whole through a hair- 
sieve, and add to it as much more stock as may be needed to 
make the quantity of soup required for table; and as the 
cucumbers,^from their watery nature, will thicken it but little, 
stir to it when it boils, as much arrow-root, rice-flour, or tous 
les mots (see page 4), as will brin^ it to a good consistency ; add 
from half to a whole pint of boilmg cream, and serve the soup 
immediately. Salt and cayenne, sufficient to season it, should 
be thrown over the cucumbers while they are stewing. The 
yolks of six or eight eggs, mixed with a dessertspoonfrd of Chili 
vinegar, may be used for this soup instead of cream; three 
dessertspoonsful of miaced parsley may then be strewed into it 
a couple of minutes before they are added : it must not, of 
course, be allowed to boil after they are stirred in. 

* This is a great disparity of numbers; bat some regard must be bad to 
•cpense, where the vegetable cannot be obtained with facility.

AN EXCELLENT GBEEN PBA8 SOUP. 

Take at their fullest size, but before they are of bad colour or 
wonn-eaten, three pints of fine lai^ peas, and boil them as for 
table (see Chapter XY.) with half a teaspoonful of carbonate of 
soda in the water, that they maj be very sreen. When they 
are quite tender, drain them well, and put them into a couple of 
quarts of boiling, pale, but gvod beef or veal stock, and stew 
them in it gently ror half anliour, then work the whole throuff h 
a fine hair-sieve ; put it into a dean pan and bring it to tne 
pcMnt of boiling ; add salt, should it be needed, and a small tea^ 
spoonful of pounded sugar, dear off the scum entirdy, and 
serve the soup as hot as possible, with small pale sippets of fried 
bread. An el^ant variety of it is made by adding a half pint 
more of stock to the peas, and about three (quarters of a pint of 
asparagus points, boiled apart, and wdl dramed before they are 
tbirown into it, which should be done only the instant before it 
is sent to table : the fried bread will not then be needed. 

Green peas, 3 pints : boiled 25 to 30 minutes, or more. Veal 
or beef stock, 2 quarts (with peas) : \ an hour. Sugar, one 
small teaspoonftd ; salt, if need^ 

Obs, — ^When there is no stock at hand, four or five pounds of 
shin of beef, boiled slowly down with three quarts of water to 
two, and well seasoned with savoury herbs, young carrots, and 
onions, will serve instead quite welL A thick slice of lean, 
undressed ham would improve it. 

Should a common English peas soup be wished for, make it 
somewhat thinner than uie one above, and add to it, just before 
it is dished, from half to three quarters of a pint of young peas 
boiled tender, and well drained. 

GBEEN PEAS SOUP, WITHOTTT MEAT. 

B(nl tender, in three quarts of water, with the proportions of 
salt and soda directed Ibr thein in Chapter XY., one quart of 
huee, full grown peas ; drain and nound them in a mortar, mix 
with them gradually five pints of tne liquor in which they were 
boiled, put the whole again over the ^i^ and stew it g^ently for 
a quarter of an hour ; then press it through a hair-sieve. In 
the mean time, simmer, in fix>m three to four ounces of butter,* 
three large, or four small cucumbers, pared and sliced, the hearts

acoordmg to the taste, cut thin, a few small sprigs of parsley, 
and, when the flavour is liked, a dozen leaves or more of mint, 
roughly chopped: keep these stirred over a gentle fire for 
nearly or quite an hour, and strew over them a half-teaspocmfol 
of salt, and a ^ood seasoning of white pepper or cayenne. When 
they are partially done, drain them m>m the hutter, put them 
into the strained stock, and let the whole boil gently until all 
the butter has been thrown to the surfiioe, and been entirely 
cleared from it ; then throw in from half to three quarters of a 
pint of young peas, boiled as for eating, and serve the soup im- 
mediately. 

When more convenient, the peas, with a portion of the liquor, 
may be pressed through a sieve, instead of being crushed in a 
mortar ; and when the colour of the soup is not so much a con- 
sideration as the flavotur, they may be slowly stewed until per- 
fectly tender in fotur ounces of good butter, instead of being 
boiled : a few green onions, and some branches of parsley may 
then be added to them. 

Green peas, 1 quart; water, 5 pints; cucumbers, 3 to 6; 
lettuces, 3 or 4 ; onions, 1 to 4 ; little parsley ; mint (if liked), 
12 to 20 leaves; butter, 3 to 4 ozs.; salt, half-teaspoonful; 
seasoning of white pepper or cayenne : 50 to 60 minutes. Young 
peas, i to I of a pmt. 

Obs, — ^We must repeat that the peas for these soups must not 
be olti, as when they are so, their fine sweet flavour is entirely 
lost, and the dried ones would have almost as good an effect ; 
nor shoul^ they be of inferior kinds. Freshly gathered mar- 
rowfats, taken at nearly, or quite their full growth, will give 
the best quality of soup. We are credibly imormed, but can- 
not assert it on our own authority, that it is often made for ex- 
Eensive* tables in early spring, with the young, tender plants or 
ahns of the peas, when they are about a foot in height. They 
are cut off dose to the ^und, like small salad, then boiled and 

Sre^ed through a strainer, and mixed with the stock. The 
avour is affirmed to be excellent 

A CHEAP ORBBN PEAS 80I7P. 

Wash veiy clean, and throw into an equal quantity of boiling 
water, salted as for peas, three quarts of the shells, and in from 
twenty to thirty minutcas, when they will be quite tender, turn 
the whole into a large strainer, and press the pods strongly with 
a wooden spoon. Measure the liquor, put two quarts of it into 
a clean, deep saucepan, and when it boils, add to it a quart of 
full grown peas, two, or even three laige cucumbers, as many

moderate-sized lettuces freed from the coarser leaves, and cut 
small, (me large onion (or more if liked), sliced extremely thin 
and stewed for half an nour in a morsel of butter before it is 
added to the soup, or gently fried without bein^ aUowed to 
brown; a branch or two of parsley, and, when uie flavour is 
liked, a dozen leaves of mint. Stew these sofUy for an hour, 
with the addition of a small teaspoonfrd, or a lai^r quantity if 
required, of salt, and a good seasoninj^ of fine white pepper, or 
of cayenne ; then jpress the whole of the vegetables with the 
soup through a haur-sieve, heat it afresh, and send it to table 
mm a dish of small fried sippets. The colour will not be so 
blight as that of the more expensive soups which precede it, but 
it will be excellent in flavour. 

Fea-shells, 3 quarts ; water, 3 quarts : 20 to 30 minutes. 
Liquor frt>m these, 2 quarts; frdl-sized green peas, 1 quart; 
Ijurge cucumbers, 2 or 3 ; lettuces, 3 ; onion, 1 (or more) ; little 
{^sley; mint, 12 leaves; seasoning of salt and pepper or cay- 
enne: stewed 1 hour. 

Obs. — The cucumbers should be pared, quartered, and freed 
from the seeds before they are added to the soup. The peas, as 
we have said already more than once, should not be old, but 
taken at their friU growth, before they lose their colour : the 
youngest of the sheUs ought to be selected for the liquor. 

BICH PEAS SOUP. 

Soak a quart of fine yellow split peas for a night, drain them 
well, and put them into a large soup-pot with five quarts of 
good brown gravy stock ; and wlien they have boiled gently for 
half an hour, add to the soup three onions; as many carrots, and 
a turnip or two, all sliced and fried carefrdly in butter; stew 
the whole softly till the peas are reduced to pulp, then add- as 
much salt and cayenne as may be needed to season it well, give 
it two or three nunutes* boil, and pass it through a sieve, press- 
ing the vegetables with it. Put into a dean saucepan as much 
as may be required for table, add a little fresh stock to it should 
it be too thick, and reduce it by quick boiling if two thin; 
throw in the white part of some msh celery sliced a quarter of 
an inch thick, and when this is tender send the soup quicklv to 
table with a dish of small fried sippets. A dessertsjpoonfiu or 
more of currie-powder greatly improves peas soup : it should be 
smoothly mixed with a few spoonsM of it, and poured to the 
remainder when this first begins to boil after having been 
strained.

butter, 3 of each ; turnips, 2 : 2^ to 3^ hours. Cayenne and salt 
as needed. Soup, 5 pmts; celery sliced, 1 laige or 2 small 
heads : 20 minutes. 

Obs, — ^When more convenient, six pounds of neck of beef 
well scored and equally, but carefully browned, may be boiled 
gently with the peas and fried vc^ietables in a sallon of water 
(which should be poured to them boiling) for four or five 
hours.

COMMON PSAS SOUP. 

Wash well a quart of ^ood split peas, and float off such as 
remain on the surface of the water ; soak them for one night, 
and boil them with a bit of soda the size of a filbert in just 
sufficient water to allow them to break to a mash. Put them 
into from three to four quarts of good beef broth, and stew 
them in it gently for an hour ; then work the whole through a 
sieve, heat afresh as much as may be required for table, season 
it with salt and cayenne or common pepper, clear it perfectly 
from scum, and send it to table with fried or toasted bread. 
Celery sliced and stewed in it as directed for the rich peas soup, 
will be found a great improvement to this. 

Peas, 1 quart : soaked 1 night ; boiled in 2 quarts or rather 
more of water, 2 to 2^ hours. Beef broth, 3 to 4 quarts : 1 
hour. Salt and cayenne or pepper as needed : 3 minutes. 

PBAS SOUP WrrHOUT MEAT. 

To a pint of peas, freed from all that are worm-eaten, and 
well wasned, put five pints of cold water, and boil them toler- 
ably tender ; then add a couple of onions (more or less according 
to the taste), a couple of fine carrots crated, one laxge or two 
moderate-sized turnips sliced, all gently tried brown in butter ; 
half a teaspoonfrd of black pepper, and three times as much of 
salt. Stew these softly, keeping them often stirred, until the 
v^etables are sufficiency tender to press through a sieve ; then 
rub the whole through one, put it into a clean pan, and when it 
boils throw in a sliced head of celery, heighten the seasoning if 
needful, and in twenty minutes serve the soup as hot as possible, 
with a dish of fried or toasted bread cut into dice. A little Chili 
vinegar can bo added when liked : a larger proportion of veget- 
ables also may be boiled down with the peas pi pleasure. Weak 
broth, or the liquor in which a joint has been boiled, can, when 
at hand, be substituted for the water, but the soup is Yery

OX-TAIL SOUP. 

An inexpensive and ver^ nutritious soup may be made of 
ox-tails, but it will be insipid in flavour witnout the addition of 
a little ham, knuckle of bacon, or a pound or two of other 
meat. Wash and soak three taUs, pour on them a gallon of cold 
water, let them be brought gradufJly to boil, throw in an ounce 
and a half of salt, and dear off the scum carefully as soon as it 
fonns upon the sur&ce; when it ceases to rise, add four mode* 
ratennzed carrots, from two to four onions, according to the 
taste, a large faggot of savoury herbs, a head of celery, a couple 
of turnips, six or eight doves, and a half-teaspoonful of pepper- 
coms. Stew these gently from three hours to three and a hal^ 
if the tails be very large; lift them out, strain the liquor, and 
fikim off all the fat ; cut the meat from the tails (or serve them, 
if preferred, divided into joints), and ^ut it into a couple of 
quarts or rather more of the stodc ; sdr m, when these b^in to ' 
boil, a thickening of arrow-root or of rice-flour, (see page 4) 
mixed with as much cayenne and salt as may be requir^ to 
flayour the soiip well, and serve it very hot. If stewed down 
untH the fledi &Us away from the bones, the ox-tails will make 
stock which will be quite a firm jelly when cold ; and this, 
strained, thickened, and well flavoured with spices, catsup, or a 
little wine, would, to many tastes, be a superior soup to the 
above. A richer one still may be made by pouring good beef 
broth instead of water to the meat in the first instance. 

Ox-tails, 3; water, 1 gallon; salt, IJ oz. ; carrots, 4; onions^ 
2 to 4 ; turnips, 2 ; celery,' 1 head ; cloves, 8 ; peppercorns, ^ 
teaspoonful ; mggot of savoury herbs : 3 hours to 3). For a 
richer soup, 5 to 6 hours. (Ham or gammon of bacon at 
pleasure, with other flavourings.) 

Obs. — To increase the savour of this soup when the meat is 
not served in it, the onions, turnips, and carrots may be gently 
fried until of a fine light brown, before they are added to it

Ohs. — ^Three pounds of beef or mutton, with two or three 
slices of ham, and vegetables in proportion to the above receipt, 
all chopped fine, and hoiled in three quarts of water for an hour 
and a half^ will make an excellent family soup on an emergency ; 
additional boiling will of course improve it, and a little spice 
should be added after it has been skimmed, and salted. It may 
easily be converted into carrot, turnip, or ground-rice soup after 
it is strained.

disagreeable. When all these marks are icversed, and the eyes 
are Mii?lr<*w, the gills ▼cry dark in hue, the fish itself flabby, and 

of offensiye odour, it is bad, and should be 
avoided. The chloride of soda will^ it is

but it -will never resemble in quality fin

observations apply equally to soles. 

The best stumon and cod fish are known by a small head, very 
thick shoulders, and a small tail ; the scales of the fi>rmer should 
be bright, and its flesh of a fine red colour : to be eaten in 
perfection it should be dressed as soon as it is caueht, before the 
curd (or white substance which lies between the fiakes of flesh) 
has melted and rendered the fish oily. In that state it is really 
crtmp, but continues so onl^ for a very few hours ; and it bears 
therefore a much higher price in the iKmdon market then, than 
when mellowed by Imving been kept a day or two. . 

The flesh of cod fish should be white and dear before it is 
boiled, whiter still after it is boiled, and firm though tender, 
sweet and mild in flavour, and separated easil v into large flakes. 
Many persons consider it rather improved tnan otherwise by 
having a little nJt rubbed along the mside of the back-bone and 
letting it lie from twenty-four to forty-eight hours before it is 
dressed. It is sometimes served crimp like salmon, and must

purchased, but the ^ honrid barbarity,** as it is truly designated, 
of skinning and dividing them while they are so, is withoat 
excuse, as they are easify destroyed *^ by pierdns the spinal 
marrow dose to the back part of the skim with a sharp pointed 
knife, or skewer. If this be done in the right place all motion 
wUl instantly cease." We quote Doctor Eitdiener^s assertion on 
this subject ; but we know that the mode of destruction which 
he recommends is commonly pipactised by the London fish- 
maogeoL BoiHi^ wmter also wm immediately cause vitalilT to 
cease, and is peraaps the most humane and leaity method of 
destroying the fish. 

Lobsters, prawns, and shrimps, are very stiff when freshfy 
boiled, and we tails turn strongly inwards ; when these relax, 
and the fish are soft and watery, they are stale ; and the smell 
^rill detect their being so instantly even if no other symptoms of 
it he remarked. If bought alive, lobsters should be chosen by 
their wdght and ^' liTeliness." The hen lobster is preferred for 
Sauce and soups, on account of the coral ; but the flesh of the 
m^e is generally considered of finer flavour for eating. The 
vivacity of their leaps will show when prawns and shrimps are 
fiesh &om the sea. 

Oysters should dose forcibly on the knife when they are 
cmeped : if the shells are apart ever so little they are losing 
their condition, and when they remain far open the fish are 
dead, and fit only to be thrown away. Small plump natives are 
very preferable to the larger and coarser kinds. 

TO C£EAH USB. 

Let this be done always with the most scrupulous nicety, for 
nothing can more effectually destroy the appetite, or diagracB 
ike cook, Ihan fish sent to table imperfectly cleaned. Handle it 
lightly, and never throw it rougMv about, so as to bruise it ; 
wash it well, but do not leave it longer in the water than is 
necessary, for fish, like meat, loses its flavour from being soaked. 
When the scales are to be removed, lay the fish flat upon its 
side, and hold it firmly with the left hand, while they are 
scraped off with the right ; turn it, and when both sides are 
done, pour or pump sufficient water over to float off all the 
loose scales ; then proceed to open and empty it. Be sure that 
not the slightest particle of offensive matter be left in the 
inside ; wash out the blood entirely, and scrape or brush it 
away, if needfiil, from the back-bone. This may easily be 
accompUshed, without opening the fish so much as to render it 
unsightly when it is sent to table. The red mullet is dressed

without being emptied, and smelts are drawn at the gflls. When 
the scales are len on, the outside of the fish should he well 
washed and wiped with a coarse doth, drawn gently from th^ 
head to the tail. Eels, to be wholesome, should be skinned, but 
they are sometimes dressed without; boiling water should then 
be poured upon them, and they should be feft in it from five to 
ten minutes, before they are cut up. The dark skin of the 
sole must be stripped off when it is fried, but it must be left on, 
like that of a turbot, when the fish is boiled, and it shoidd be 
dished with the white side upwards. Whitings are skinned, 
and dipped usually into ^g and bread-crumbs, when they 
are to be fried ; but for boOmg or broiling, the skin must be 
left on. 

TO KCEP FISH. 

We find that all the smaller kinds of fish keep best if emptied 
and cleaned as soon as they are brqught in, then wiped gently 
as dry as they can be, and nung separately by the head on tbe 
hooks in the ceiling of a cool mrder, or in the open air when 
the weather will allow. When there is danger of their being 
attacked by flies, a wire safe, placed in a strong draught of air, 
is better adapted to the purpose. Soles in winter will remain 
good a couple of days wnen thus prepared ; and eyen whitings 
and mackerel may be kept so without losing any of their excd- 
lence. Salt may be rubbed slightly oyer cod fish, and well 
dong the back-bone, but it injures the flayour of salmon, the 
inside of which may be rubbed with yinegar, and peppered in- 
stead. When iexcessiye sultriness renders all of these modes 
imayailing, the fish must at once be partially cooked to preserye 
it, but this should be ayoided if possible, as it is yery rarely so 
good when this method is resorted to* 

TO SWEETEN TAINTED FISH. 

The application of the pyroligneous acid will efiect this when 
the taint is but slight. A wineglassful, mixed with two of 
water, ma^ be poured oyer the fish, and rubbed upon the parts 
more particularly requiring it ; it must then be left for some 
minutes untouched, and afterwards washed in seyeral waters, 
and soaked imtil the smell of the add is no longer perceptible.

perties, will have more effect when the fish is in a wone 
state. It should be applied in the same manner, and will not at 
all injure the flavour of the fish, which is not fit for food 
when it cannot be perfectly purified by either of these means. 
The chloride may be diluted more or less, as occasion may 
require. 

bbuve fob BonjNG nsH. 

Fish is exceedingly insipid if sufficient salt be not mixed with 
the water in which it is boiled, but the precise <][uantity required 
for it will depend, in some measure, upon the kmd of salt which 
is used. Fine common salt is that for which our directions are 
given ; but when the Maldon salt, which is very siiperior in 
strength, as well as in its other qualities, is substituted for it, a 
smaller quantity must be allowed. About four ounces to tiie 
gallon of water will be sufiicient for small fish in general ; an 
additional ounce, or rather more, will not be too much for cod 
fish, lobsters, crabs, prawns, and shrimps; and salmon will 
require eight ounces, as the brine for this fish should be stronff : 
the water should always be perfectly well skimmed &om the 
moment the scum beguis to form upon the surface. 

Mackerel, whiting, and other small fish, 4 ozs. of salt to a 
gallon of water. Cod fish, lobsters, crabs, prawns, shrimps, 5 
to 6 ozs. Salmon, 8 ozs. 

TO BENBEB BOILED FISH FIBH. 

Put a small bit of saltpetre with the salt into the water 
in which it is boiled : a quarter oimce will be sufficient for a 
gallon. 

TO KEEP FISH HOT FOB TABLE. 

Never leave it in the water after it is done ; but if it cannot 
be sent to table as soon as it is readv to serve, lift it out, lay the 
fish-plate into a large and very hot dish, and. set it across 
the fish-kettle ; just dip a clean doth into the boiling water, and 
spread it upon the fish; place a tin cover over it, and let it 
remain so until two or three minutes before it is wanted, then 
remove the cloth, and put the fish back into the kettle for an 
instant that it may be as hot as possible ; drain, dish, and serve 
it immediately: the water should be kept boiling the whole 
time.

most delicate and delicious fish that can be sent to table ; but it 
is generally an expensive dish, and its excellence so mnch depends 
on the manner in which it is dressed, that great care should be 
taken to prepare it properly. After it is emptied, wash the 
in8i4e nntil it is perfectly cleansed, and mb lightly a little fine 
salt oyer the outside, as this will render less washii:^ and hand- 
ling necessary, by at once taking off the slime; change the 
water several times, and when the fish is as clean as it is possible 
to render it, draw a sharp knife through the thickest part of the 
middle of the back nearly through to the bone. Never cut off 
the fins of a turbot when pr^>aring it for table, and remember 
that it is the dark side of the fish in which the incision is to be 
made, to prevent the skin of the white side from cracking. 
Dissolve in a well-cleaned turbot, or common fish-kettle, in as 
much cold spring water as will cover the fish abundantly, salt, 
in the proportion of four ounces to the gallon, and a morsel of 
saltpetre ; wipe the fish-plate with a clean cloth, lay the turbot 
upon it with the white side upwards, place it in i!ii<^ kettle, bring 
it slowly to boil, and clear off the scum ihoroughly as it rises. 
Let the water only just simmer until the fish is done, then lift 
it out, drain, and sude it gently on to a very hot dish, with a hot 
napkin neatly arranged over tne drainer. Send it immediately 
to table with rich lobster sauce, good plain melted butter, and a 
dish of dressed cucumber. For a simple dinner, anchovy, or 
shrimp-sauce is sometimes served with a small turbot Should 
there be any cracks in the skin of the fish, branches of curled 
parsley may be laid lightly over them, or part of the inside 
coral of the lobster, rubbed through a fine hair-sieve, may be 
sprinkled over the fish ; but it is better without either, when it 
is very white, and unbroken. When gamishings are in fiivour, 
a slice of lemon and a tuft of curled parsley, may be placed 
alternately round the edee of the dish. A boruer of fried 
smelts, or of fillets of soles, was fonperly served, in general^ 
round a turbot, and is always a very admissible addition, though 
no longer so fashionable as it was. From fifteen to twenty 
minutes will boil a moderate-sized fish, and ftx)m twenty to 
thirty a large one ; but as the same time will not always be 
sufficient for a fish of the same weight, the cook must watch it 
attentively, and lift it out as soon as its appearance denotes its 
being done. 

Moderate sized-turbot, 15 to 20 minutes. Large, 20 to 30 
minutes. Longer, if of unusual size. 

Ohs — A lemon gently saueezed, and rubbed over the fish, is 
thought to preserve its whiteness. Some good cooks still put

turbot into boding wb^t, and to prevent its breaking, tie it with 
a cloth tightly to the fish-pkte; but cold water seems better 
adapted to it, as it is desirable that it should be gradually heated 
through before it begins to boiL 

TUBBOT A I<A CBEBfE. 

Baise caiefblly from the bones the flesh of a cold turbot, and 
clear it firom the dark skin ; cut it into small squares, and put it 
into an exceedingly dean stewpan or saucepan ; then make and 
poor upon it the cream-sauce of Chapter Iv., or make. as much 
as may be required for the fish by the same receipt, with equal 
proportions of milk and cream, and a little additional flour. 
Heat the turbot slowly in the sauce, but do not allow it to boil, 
and send it very hot to table. The white skin of the fish is 
not usually added to this dish, and it is of better appearance 
without it ; but for a family dinner, it may be left on uie flesh, 
when it is much liked. No add must he stirred to the sauce 
until the whole is ready for table. 

TUBBOT AU BBCHAMESj, OB, IH BECHAMEI. SAUCE. 

Prepare the cold turbot as for the preceding receipt, but leave 
no portion of the skin with it. Heat it in a rich becnamel sauce, 
and serve it in a vol-au-vent, or in a deep dish, with a border 
of fried bread cut in an elegant form, and made ifith one dark, 
and one light sippet, placed alternately. The surface may be 
covered wiu a haif-incn layer of delicately fried bread-crumbs, 
perfectly well drained and dried ; or they may be spread over 
the fish without being fried, then moistened with darined butter, 
and browned with a salamander. 

TO BOIL A JOHN DOBT. 
In best teason from Michaelmas to Christmas, but good all the year. 

The John Dory, though of uninvitii^ appearance is consi- 
dered by some persons as the most defidous fish that appears 
at table ; in the general estimation, however, it ranks next to 
the turbot, from which it may be cUstinguished by its yellow- 
grey colour as well as by the long filaments on tne back, and 
a general thickness of form. It is dressed in predsdy the same * 
manner and served with the same sauces. 

TO BOn. A BBILL. 

Proceed exactly as for a turbot ; sprinkle lobster coral passed

52 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IL 

lobster sauce and plain melted butter to table with it. This 
fish, in delicacy and excellence, is little inferior to turbot. 

TO BOIL SALMON. 

In full season firom Maj to August : may be had much earlier, bnt la searoa 

and dear. 

To preserve the fine colour of this fish, and to set the curd 
when it is ^uite freshly caught, it is usual to put it into boiling, 
instead of mto cold water. Scale, empty, and wash it with toe 
ffreatest nicety, and be especially carefdl to cleanse all the blood 
from the' inside. Stir into the fish-kettle eight ounces of com* 
mon salt to the gallon of water, let it boil quickly for a minute 
or two, take off all the scum, put in the salmon and boil it mo- 
derately fast, if it be small, but more gently should it be very 
thick ; and assure yourself that it is quite sufficiently done be« 
fore it is sent to table, for nothing can be more distastefiil, even 
to the eye, than fish which is under dressed. 

From two to three pounds of the thick part of a fine salmon 
will require half an hour to boil it, but eignt or ten pounds will 
be done enough in little more than double that time ; less, in 
proportion to its weight, should be allowed for a small fish, or 
for the thin end of a large one. Do not allow the salmon to re- 
main in the water after it is ready to serve, or both its flavour 
and appearance will be injured. Dish it on a hot napkin, and 
send dressed cucumber, and anchovy, shrimp, or lobster sauce, 
and a tureen of plain melted butter to table with it. 

To each gallon water, 8 ozs. salt. Salmon, 2 to 3 lbs. 
(thick) ; i hour : 8 to 10 lbs., 1^ hour : small, or thin fish, less 
time. 

Obs, — A fashionable mode of serving salmon at the present 
day is to divide the larger portion of the body into three equal 
parts ; to boil them in water, or in a marinade ; and to serve 
them dished in a line, but not close together, and covered with 
a rich Genevese sauce : it appears to us that the skin should be 
stripped from any fish over which the sauce is poured, but ia 
this case it is not customary. 

CRIMPED SALMON. 

Cut into slices an inch and a half, or two inches thick, the 
body of a salmon quite newly caught ; throw them into strong 
salt and water as tney are done, but do not let them soak in it ; 
wash them well, lay them on a fish-plate, and put them into 
fast-boiling water, salted, and well skimmed. In from ten to 
fifteen minutes they will be done. Dish them on a napkin, and 



CHAP. U.] FISH, 53 

send them veiy hot to table with lobster sauce, and plain melted 
butter ; or with the caper fish-sance of Chapter IV. The water' 
ehonld be salted as for salmon boiled in the ordinair way, and 
the scorn should be cleared off with great care after the fish 
is in. 
In boiling water, 10 to 15 minutes. 

SAUfON A LA ST. MABCeL. 

Separate some cold boiled sahnon into flakes, and free them 
entireW^ from the skin ; break the bones, and boil them in a 
pint of water for half an hour. Strain off the liquor, put it into 
a dean saucepan and stir into it by degrees when it begins to 
boil quickly, two ounces of butter mixed wi^h a large teaspoon- 
M of flour, and when the whole has boiled for two or three mi- 
nutes add a teaspoouM of essence of anchovies, one of good 
mushroom catsup, half as much lemon-juice or Chili yinegar, a 
half saltspoonful of poxuided mace, some cayenne, and a veiy 
little salt. Shell from halt* to a whole pint of shrimps, add 
them to the salmon, and heat the fish very slowlj in the sauce 
by the side of the fire, but do not allow it to boil. When it is 
very hot, dish, and send it quickly to table. French cooks, 
when they re-dress fish or meat of any kind, prepare the flesh 
with great nicety, and then put it into a stewpan, and pour the 
sauce upon it, which is, we think, better than the more usual 
English mode of laying it into the boiling sauce. The cold 
salmon may also be re-heated in the cream sauce of Chapter IV. 
or in the Maitre d* Hotel sauce which follows it ; and will be 
found excellent with either. This receipt is for a moderate 
sized dish. 

Obs. — We regret that we cannot give insertion to a lar^ 
number of receipts for dressing this truly excellent fish, which 
answers for almost eveiy mode of cookery. It ma^ be fried in 
catlets, broiled, baked, roasted, or stewed ; served m a common, 
or in a raised pie, or in a potato-pasty ; in a salad, in jelly ; 
collared, smoked, or pickled ; and will be found good prepared 
by an^ of these processes. A rather full seasoning of savoury 
herbs is thought to corredb the effect of the natur^ richness of 
the salmon. For«directions to broil, bake, or roast it, the reader 
is referred to Chapter Vn.

44 MODEBN COOKERY. [CHAP. I. 

strain the liquor, and put it into a large clean saucepan, add a 
thickening or rice-flour or arrow-root, pepper and salt if needed, 
and a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup. In the mean time, 
cut all the meat into small, thick slices, add it to the soup, and 
serve it as soon as it is veiy hot. The thickening and catsup 
may be omitted, and all the vegetables, pressed through a strainer, 
may be stirred into the soup instead, before the meat is put back 
into it. 

SOUP IH HASTE. 

Chop tolerably flne a pound of lean beef^ mutton, or veal* 
and when it is partly done, add to it a small carrot and one 
ftnall turnip, cut in slices, half an ounce of celery, the white 
part of a moderate-sized leek, or a quarter-ounce of onion. 
Mince all these together and put the whole into a deep saucepan 
with three pints of cold water. When the soup boils, take off 
the scum, and add a little salt and pepper. In half an hour it 
wiU be ready to serve with or without straming: it may be 
flavoured at will, with cayenne, catsup, or aught else tlmt is 
preferred. It may be converted into French spring broth, by 
passing it through a sieve, and boiling it agiun for five or six 
minutes with a nandM of young and nicely-picked sorrel. 

Meat, 1 lb.; carrot, 2 ozs. ; turnip, 1) oz.; celery, ) oz.; 
onion, i oz.; water, 3 pints: half an houi^ Little pepper and 
salt. 

Obs. — Three pounds of beef or mutton, with two or three 
slices of ham, and vegetables in proportion to the above receipt, 
all chopped fine, and hoiled in three quarts of water for an hour 
and a hsuf^ will make an excellent family soup on an emergencjr ; 
additional boiling will of course improve it, and a little spice 
should be added after it has been skunmed, and salted. It may 
easily be converted into carrot, turnip, or ground-rice soup after 
it is strained. 

VBAL OB MTJtTON BBOTH. 

To each pound of meat add a quart of cold water, bring it 
gently to boil, skim it veiy clean, add salt in the same proportion 
as for bouillon (see page 4), with spices and vegetables also, 
icmless ur^voured hroitn he required, when a few peppercorns, 
a blade or two of mace, and a bunch of savoury herbis will be 
sufficient; though for some purposes even tnese, with the 
exception of the salt, are better omitted. Simmer the broth for 
about four hours, unless the quantity be veiy small, when &om 
two and a ludf to three, will be sufficient. A little rice boiled 
down with the meat will both thicken the broth, and render it

stew it for five minutes, then, add four tablespoonsM of extremely 
fioe bread-crumbs, and simmer it for three minutes longer. Stir 
well into the sauce a large teaspoonM of arrow-root quite free 
from lumps, a fourth part as much of mace, something less of 
cayenne, and a tablespoonful of essence of anchovies, mixed with 
a glass of white wine and a dessertspoonAil of lemon juice. BoU 
the whole for a couple of minutes, lift out the fish care ftdly with 
a slice, pour the sauce over, and serve it quickly.

M : 2 minutes. 

Oh, — A dozen or two of oysters, bearded, and added with 
their strained liquor to this dish two or three minutes before it 
is served, will, to many tastes, vary it veiy agreeably. 

ST£Wra> COD FISH, IN BBOWN SAUCB. 

Slice the fish, take off the skin, flour it well, and fiy it 
quickly a fine brown ; lift it out and dram it on the back of a 
sieve, arrange it in a dean stewpan, and pour in as much good 
brown gravy, boiling, as will nearly cover it ; add from one to 
two gl^ses of port wine, or rather more of claret, a dessert- 
spoonM of Chih vinegar, or the juice of half a lemon, and some 
Cayenne, with as much salt as may be needed. Stew the fish 
very softly until it just begins to break, lift it careftdly with a 
slice into a very hot dish, stir into the gravy an ounce and 
a half of butter, smoothly kneaded with a large teaspoonfol of 
flour, and a little pounded mace, give the sauce a minute^s boil, 
poor it over the fish, and serve it immediately. The wine may 
be omitted, good shin of beef stock substituted for the gravy, 
and a teaspoonful of soy, one of essence of anchovies, and two 
tablespoonsful of Harvey's sauce added to flavour it. 

TO son. SALT nsH. 

When very salt and dry, this must be long-soaked before it 
is boiled, but it is eeneraUy supplied by the &hmon£ers nearly 
or quite ready to dress. When it is not so, lay it &t a night 
into a large quantity of cold water, then let it lie exposed to the 
air for some time, then again put it into water, and continue 
thus until it is well softened. Brush it very clean, wash it 
thoroughly, and put it with abundance of cold water into the

fish kettle, place it hear the fire and let it heat very slowly 
indeed. Keep it just on the point of simmering, without allow- 
ing it ever to boil (which would render it h£d,) &om three 
quarters of an hour to a foil hour, accordmg to its weight ; 
Miould it he quite small and thin, less time will he sofficient for 
it; hut hy following these directions, the fish will he almost as 
good as if it were £esh. The scum should he cleared off with 
great care from the heginning. Egg sauce and hoiled parsneps 
are the usual accompaniments to salt fish, which should be 
dished upon a hot napkin, and which ia sometimes also thickly 
strewed ¥rith chopped ^ggs. 

SALT FISH. 

(A la Maitre (THoteL) 

Boil the fish by the foregoing receipt, or take the remains of 
that which has been served at table, flake it off clear from the 
bones, and strip away eveiy morsel of the skin ; then lay it into 
a very clean saucepan or stewpan, and pour upon it the sharp 
MMtre d*Hotel sauce of Chapter IV. ; or, dissolve gently two or 
three ounces of butter with four or five spoonsful of water, and 
a half-teaspoonful Of flour; add some pepper or cayenne, veiy 
little salt, and a dessertspoonfol or more of minced parsley. Heat 
the fish slowly quite through in either of these sauces, and toss 
or stir it untu the whole is well mixed ; if the second be used, 
add the juice of half a lemon, or a small quantity of Chili 
vin^ar, just before it is taken from the fire. The fish thus 
prepared may be served in a deep dish, with a border of mashed 
parsneps or potatoes. 

TO Boni CODS souims. 

Should they be highly salted, soak them for a pight, and on 
the following day, rub off entirely the discoloured skin ; wash 
them well, lay them into plenty of cold milk and water, and 
boil them gently from thirty to for^ minutes, or longer, should 
they not be qmte tender. Clear off the scum as it rises with 
great care, or it will sink, and adhere to the sounds, of which 
the appearance will then be spoiled. Drain them weU, dish 
them on a napkin, and send egg sauce and plain melted butter 
to table with them.

TO TRY SOLES. 
In Mason all the year. 

An fish to fry wen must he not only fresh hut perfectly 
free from moisture, particularly when tney are to he dre»»ed 
with egg and hread-crumhs, as these will not otherwise adhere 
to them. Empty, skin, and wash the soles with extreme nicety, 
from one to two hours hefore they are wanted for tahle ; and 
after haying deaiied and wiped them verv dry, both inside and 
out replace the roes, fold and press them gently in a soft 
dean cloth, and leave them wrapped in it imtil it is time to fiy 
them ; or suspend them singly upon hooks in a current of cool 
air, which is perhaps the hetter method of proceeding when it 
can he done conveniently. Cover them equally in every part, 
first with some heaten egg, and then with fine dry crumbs of 
bread.* Melt in a large and exceedingly dean frying pan, over 
a brisk and clear fire, as much very pure-flavoured lard as will 
float the fish, and let it be sufficiently hot before they are laid in 
to brown them quickly ; for if this be neglected it will be impos- 
sible to render them crisp or dry. When the fat ceases to bubble, 
throw in a small bit of bread, and if it takes a good colour im- 
mediately the soles may be put in without delay. An ex- 
perienced cook will know, without this test, when it is at the 
proper point ; but the learner will do better to avail herself of 
it until practice and observation shall have rendered it unneces- 
saiy to her. Before the fish are laid into the pan, take them by 
the head and shake the loose crumbs from them. When they 
are firm, and of a fine amber-colour on one side, turn them 
with care, passing a slice under them and a fork through the 
heads, and brown them on the other. Lift them out, and 
either dry them well on a soft cloth laid upon a sieve reversed, 
before the fire, turning them often, or press them lightly in 
hot white blotting paper. Dish them on a drainer covered with 
a hot napkin and send them to table without delay with shrimp 
or anchovy sauce, and plain melted butter. 

* The crumbs should be of a stale loaf, finely grated and shaken through a 
eaUender, then well dried in a very slack oven or ut a distance from a clear f re, 
and allowed to become cold before they are used : they are still better when made 
of bread which has teen rendered crisp quite through, aud then beaten small, ts 
directed in Chapter IV.

Very small soles will be done in six minutes, and large ones 
in about ten. They may be floured and £ried, without being 
essed and crumbed but this is not a yery usual mode of serv- 
i^them. 

Small soles, 6 minutes ; large, about 10 mktutes. 

TO BOIL SOLES. 

The flesh of a fine fresh sole, when boiled with caie, is 
remarkably sweet and delicate : if yery large it may be dressed 
and seryed as turbot, to which it will be round little inferior. 
Clean and wash it thoroughly, but do not skin it; coyer it 
plentifully with cold water, throw in a handM of salt and a 
morsel of saltpetre, about h^ the size of a hazel nut. When 
the water boils skim it well, and let the fish simmer very softly 
from fiye to ten minutes. Soles of moderate size should be laid 
into warm water, and will be sufficiently done with five 
minutes' simmering : these should be freed firom the dark skin 
before they are dressed, and dished with the white skin upwards. 
Send shrimp, lobster, or anchoyy sauce and dressed cucumber 
to table with them. 

Very large sole, 5 to 10 minutes ; moderate sized, 4 to 6 
minutes. 

FILLETS OF SOLES. 

The word JUlet, whether applied to fish, poultry, game, or 
butcher's meat, means simply the flesh of either (or of certain 
portions of it), raised clear from the bones in a handsome form, 
and diyided or not, as the manner in which it is to be seryed 
may require. It is an elegant mode of dressing various kinds of 
. fish, and even those which are not the most highly esteemed, 
afford an excellent 'dish when thus prepared. Soles to be filleted 
with advantage should be large ; the nesh may then be divided 
down the middle of the back, next, separated from the fins, and 
with a very sharp knife raised dean irom the bones.* When 
thus prepared, the fillets may be divided, trimmed into a good 
form, egged, covered with fine crambs, firied in the usual way, 
and served with the same sauces as the whole fish ; or each fillet 
may be rolled up, in its entire length if very small, or after 
being once divided if large, and fastened witn a slight twine, 
or a short thin skewer; then egged, crumbed, and ftied in 

' * A celebrated French cook gires the following instructioni for Faising theta 
flllets : — " Take them ap by running your knife first between the bones and the 
fiesh, then between the skin and the nllet ; by leaning pretty hard on the tab.e 
they wiU come off rery neatly." 



CHAP, n.] FISH. 59 

plenty of boiling lard ; or merely well floured and fried 
ffom eight to ten minutes. When the fish are not very 
large, they are sometimes honed without being parted in the 
middle, and each side is rolled from the tail to tne head, after 
being first spread with pounded shrimps mixed with a third of 
their volume of butter, a few bread-crumbs, and a high season- 
ing of mace and cayenne ; or with pounded lobster mixed wiUi 
a laige portion of the coi^ and the same seasoning, and propor- 
tion of butter as the shrimps ; then laid into a dish, with the 
ingredients directed for the soles au plat : wdl covered with 
crombs of bread and clarified butter, and baked from twelve to- 
gizteen minutes, or until the crumbs are coloured to a fine 
brown in a moderate oven. 

The fillets may likewise be cut into small strips or squares of 
nnifonn size, lightly dredged with pepper or cayenne, salt and 
flour, and fried m butter over a brisk fire ; then well drained, 
and sauced with a good bechamel, flavoured with a teaspoonful 
of minced parsley. 

BAKED SOLES. (JScieS aU plat^ GOOD. 

Clarify from two to three ounces of fresh butter, and pour it 
into the dish in which the fish are to be served ; add to it a little 
salt, some cayenne, a teaspoonfiil of essence of anchovies, and from 
one to two glasses of sherry, or of any other dry white wine ; lay 
in a couple of fine soles which have been well deaned and wiped 
ver^ dry, strew over them a thick layer of fine bread-crumbs, 
moisten Uiem with clarified butter, set the dish into a moderate 
oTcao, and bake the fish a quarter of an hour. A layer of 
shrimps placed between the soles is a gr^t improvement ; and 
ve w(rald also recommend a little lemon-juice to be mixed with 
the sauce. 

Baked, 15 minut^. 

Obs. — ^The soles are, we think, better without the wine in this 
receipt They require but a small portion of liquid, which 
might be supplied by a little additional butter, a spoonful of 
vater or pale gravy, the lemon-juice, and store-sauce. Minced 
parsley may be mixed with the bread-crumbs when it is liked. 

SOLES STEWED IN CSEAM. 

Prepare some very fresh middling sized soles with exceeding 
nicety, put them into boiling water slightly salted, and simmer 
them for two minutes only ; lift them out, and let them drain ; 
lay them into a wide stewpan with as much sweet rich cream as 
will nearly cover them ; add a good seasoning of pounded mace, 



60 MODERN COOEEBT. [CHAP. It. 

Cayenne, and salt ; stew the fish softly from six to ten mintites, 
or until the flesh parts readily from the bones ; dish them, stir the 
juice of half a lemon to the sauce, pour it over the soles, and 
send them immediately [to table. Some lemon-rind may be 
boiled in the cream, if approved ; and a small teaspoonfal of 
arrow-root, very smoothly mixed with a little milk, may be 
Stirred to the sauce (should it require thickening) before the 
lemon-juice is added. Turbot and brill also may be dressed by 
this receipt, time, proportioned to their sise, being of course 
allowed for them. 

Soles, 3 or 4 : boiled in water 2 minutes. Cream, ^ to whole 
pint ; salt, mace, cayenne : fish stewed, 6 to 10 minutes. Juice 
of half a lemon. 

Obi. — In Cornwall the fish is laid at once into thick clotted 
cream, and stewed entirely in it ; but this method gives to the 
sauce, which ought to be extremely delicate, a coarse fishy 
flavour which the previous boil in water prevents. 

At Penzance, grey mtdl^t, after being scaled, are divided in the 
middle, just covered with cold water, and softly boiled, with the 
addition of branches of parsley, pepper, and salt, until the flesh 
of the back parts easily from the bone; clotted cream, minced 
parsley, and lemon-juice are then added to the sauce, and the 
mullet are dished with the heads and tails laid even to the thick 
parts of the back, where the fish were cut asunder. Hake, too, : 
IS there divided at every joint (having previously been scaled), \ 
dipped into esg, then tnickly covered with fine bread-crumbs I 
mixed with plenty of minced parsley, and fried a fine brown. 

TO PRY WHITINOS. , 

In fiill season from Michaelmas to beginning of Febraarjr. j 

Clean; skin, and dry them thoroughly in a cloth, &8teix their 
tails to their mouths, brush them equally over with beaten eggs, 
and cover them with the finest bread-crumbs, mixed with a little ; 
flour ; fry them a clear golden brown in plenty of boiling lard, ; 
drain and dry them well, dish them on a hot napkin and serve | 
them with good melted butter, and the sauce cruets, or with i 
w«ll made shrimp or anchovy sauce. A small half-teaspoonful 
of salt should be beaten up with the egjgs used in preparing the 
whitings : two will be sufficient for hair a dozen fi^ 

5 to 8 minutes, according to their size. 

FILLETS OF WHITINGS. 

Emphr and wash thoroughly, but do not skin the fish. Take 
off the fiesh on both sides close to the bones, passing the knife

from the tail to the head ; divide each side in two, trim the 
fillets into good shape, fold them in a doth, that the moisture 
may be weS absorbed from them ; dip them into, or draw them 
through, some beaten ^g, then dip them into fine crumbs mixed 
with a small portion of nour, and fry them a fine light brown, in 
lard or darined butter ; drain them well, press them in white 
blotting-paper, dish them one over the other in a circle, and 
send the usual sauce to table with them. The fillets may also 
be broiled after being dipped into eggs seasoned with salt and 
pepper, then into crumbs of bread, then next into clarified butter, 
and a second time into the bread-crumbs (or, to shorten the 
process, a portion of clarified butter may be mixed with the eggs 
at first), and served with good melted butter, or thickened veal 
gravy, seasoned with cayenne, lemon-juice, and chopped parsley. 
Five minutes will fry the fillets, even when very large : rather 
more time will be reqiured to broil them. 

I TO BOIL WHTTINOS. 

{French Receipt^ 

Having scraped, cleaned, and wiped them, lay them on a 
fish-plate, and put them into water at the point of boiling; 
throw in a handful of salt, two bay leaves, and plenty of 
parsley, well washed, and tied together; let the fish^u^/ simmer 
irom five to ten minutes, and watch them closely that tl^ey may 
not be over-done. Serve parsley and butter with them, and 
use in making it the liquor in which the whitings have been 
boiled. 

Just simmered from 5 to 10 minutes. 

BAKED WHITINGS A. UL rHANQAISE. 

Proceed with these exactly as with baked soles, page 59, or, 
pour a htfle clarified butter into a deep dish, and strew it rather 
thickly with finely-minced mushrooms, mixed with a teaspoonfiil 
of parsley, and (when the flavour is liked, and considered appro- 
' pnate) with an eschalot or two, or the white part of a few green 
onions, also chopped very small. On these place the fish, after 
they have been scaled, emptied, thoroughly washed, and wiped 
dry : season them well with salt, and white pepper, or cayenne ; 
siHrinkle more of the herbs upon them ; pour gently from one to 
two glasses of light white wine into the dish, cover the whitings 
with a thick layer of fine crumbs of bread, sprinkle these plenti- 
fully with clarified butter, and bake the fish trom fifteen to twenty 
minutes. Send a cut lemon only to table with them. When 
the wine is not like^ a few spoonsful of pale veal gravy can be

can be used instead ; or a lai^ger quantity of clarified butter, 
-with a tablespoonfol of water, a teaspoonful of leoxm-pickle 
and of mushroom catsup, and a few drops of soy. 
15 to 20 minutes. 

TO BOIL MACKEEEL. 
In fall MMon In May, June, and July ; may be had alao in early lyrt a g. 

Open the fish sufficiently to admit of the insides beb^ per- 
feeity cleansed, but not more than is necessary for this purpoee ; 
empty them with care, lay the roes apart, and wash both tltem 
and the mackerel delicately clean, it is customary now to lay 
these, and the greater number of other ^ah as well, into ooM 
"water when they are to be boiled ; fi)rmerly all were plunged 
Bt once into fiist-boiling water. For such as are small and deli- 
cate, it should be warm, but not scalding; they should be 
brought gently to a soft boil, and simmered until they are done ; 
the scum shomd be cleared off as it rises, and the usual propor- 
tion of salt stirred into the water before the mackerd are pat in. 
The roes are commonly replaced in the fish, but as they some- 
times require more boiling than the mackerel themselves, it is 
better, when, they are very large, to lay them upon the drainer 
by their sides. From fifteen to twenly minutes will generally 
be sufficient to boil a full-sized mackerel : some will be done in 
less time, but they must be watched, and lifted out as soo^ as 
the tails split, and the eyes are starting. 

Dish them on a napkin, and send fennel or gooseberry sauce 
to table with them, and plain melted butter also. 
\ Small mackerel, 10 to 15 minutes ; large, 16 to 20 minutes. 

TO BAEJB MACKESEL. 

After they have been cleaned and well washed, wipe them 
very diy, fill the insides with the forcemeat. No. 1 of Chapter 
VL sew them up, arrange them, with the roes, dosely togeuier 
in a coarse bakmg-dish, flour them lightly, strew a littk fine 
salt over, and stick bits of butter upon them ; or pour some 
equally over them, after having just dissolved it m a small 
saucepan. Half an hour in a moderate oven will bake them. 
Ovster forcemeat is always appropriate for any kind of ^sh 
which is in season, while the oysters are so ; but the mackerel 
are commonly served, and are very good with that which we 
have named. Lift them careftdly into a hot dish idter they are 
taken firom the oven, and send melted butter, and the sauce 
cruets to table with them.

ont the backbones ;* wipe ihe mackerel very diy, dust fine adt, 
8Dd pepper (or cayenne), over them, flour them well, fry them 
a fine brown in boiling lard, drain them thoroughly, and serve 
them with the following sauce : — Dissolve in a small saucepan 
an ounce and a half of butter smoothly mixed with a teaspoon- 
fol of flour, some salt, pepper, and cayenne, shake these over a 
gentle fire until they are lightly coloured, then add by slow 
degrees nearly half a pint of good broth, or gravy, and the juice 
of one large lemon : boil the sauce for a couple of minutes, and 
serve it very hot. Or, instead of this, add a large teaspoonfiil 
of strong made-mustard, and a dessertepoonfiil of Chili vinegar, 
to some thick melted butter, and serve it with the fish. A 
spoonM of Harvey's sauce, or of mushroom catsup, can be 
mixed with this last, at pleasure. 

FILIfTS OF IIACKESBL. 

(Fried or Broiled.) 

Take off the flesh quite whole on either side, from three fine 
mackerel, which have been opened and properly cleaned ; let it 
be entirely firee from bone, dry it well m a cloth, then divide 
each part in two, and dip them into the beaten yolks of a couple 
of eggs, seasoned with salt and white pepper or cayenne ; cover 
them equally with fine dry crumbs of biead, and fry them like 
soles; or dip them into clarified butter, and then again into the 
crnmhs, and broil them over a very clear fire of a fine brown. 
Dish them in a circle one over the other, and send them to table 
with the M&itre d*Hotel sauce of Chapter IV., or with the one 
which follows it. The French pour the sauce into the centre of 
the dish ; but for broiled fillets this is not so well, we think, as 
serving it in a tureen. The roes of the fish, after being well 
washed and soaked, may be dressed with them, or thev may be 
made into patties. Minced parsley can be mixed with tne biead- 
cmmbs when it is liked. 

BOILED lUiLETS OV BIACKEBEL.

above, place it flat in one layer in a wide stewpan or saucepan, 
and just cover the fillets witn cold water ; throw in a teaspoon- 
fal of salt, and two or three small sprigs of parsle^r. Bring the 
mackerel slowly to a boil, clear off me scum with care, and 
after two or three minutes of slow simmering, try the fillets with 
a fork ; if the thick part divides with a touch, they are done. 
Lift them out cautiously with a slice ; drain, and serve them 
very hot with good parsley and butter ; or strip off the skin 
quickly, and pour a M&itre d'Hotel sauce over them. 

MACKEREL BROILED WHOLE. 

(An excellent Receipt.) 

Emjyty, and cleanse perfectly a fine and very fresh mackerel, 
but without opening it more tlian is needM ; diy it well, either 
in a cloth, or by hanging it in a cool air until it is stiff; make, 
with a sharp knife, a deep incision the whole length of the fish, 
on either side of the back bone, and about half an inch from it, 
and with a feather put in a little cayenne and fine salt, mixed 
with a few drops or good salad oil or clarified butter. Lay the 
mackerel over a moderate fire upon a well heated eridiron, 
which has been rubbed with suet; loosen it gently snould it 
stick, which it will do unless often moved; and when it is 
equally done on both sides, turn the back to the fire. About 
half an hour will broil it well. K a sheet of thickly-buttered 
writing-paper be folded round it, and just twisted at the ends 
before it is laid on the gridiron, it will be finer eating than if 
exposed to the fire ; but sometimes when this is done, the skin 
will adhere to the paper, and be drawn off with it, which 
injures its appearance. A cold Mditre d'Hotel sauce (see Chap- 
ter rV.), may be put into the back before it is sent to table. 
This is one of the very best modes of dressing a mackerel, which 
in flavour is quite a different fish when thus prepared to one 
which is simply boiled. A drop of oil is sometimes passed over 
the skin to prevent its sticking to the iron. It may be laid to 
the fire after having been merely cut as we have directed, when 
it is preferred so.

teaspoonftd of soy, and one of lemon-juice ; stew the mackerel 
TeiT softly until the thinner parts be^ to break, lift them out 
wito care, dish and serve them in their sauce as hot as possible. 
We can recommend the dish to our readers as a very exodlent 
one. A garnish of fried sippets can be placed round the fish at 
will. A teaspoonful of made-mustard should be stirred to the 
sauce before it is poured over the fish.

with a very small Ht of saltpetre to render tbem firm. Skhn 
the water, and sinmier them firom seven to ten minutes, accord- 
ing to their size. Send them very hot to table, with a tureen of 
melted butter, and one of anchovy sauce. 

7 to 10 minutes. 
• Obs. — ^In Scotland, haddocks are skinned before th^ are 
boiled, and the heads taken off, but we see no advantage in this 
mode of dresdng them. Whitings, fresh herrings, and codlings, 
may all be dressed by this receipt, the time only being varied 
according to the size of the fish. 

BAKED HADDOCKS. 

After they have been cleaned, dry them thoroughly, then 
bake them, as directed in the common receipt for pike, or fill 
them with oyster-forcemeat, or with No. 1. of Chapter IV., if 
more convenient, and proceed as for baked mackerel. 

20 to 30 minutes ; longer if very large. 

TO FBT HADDOCKS. 

Follow the directions given for fillets of whitings, or should a 
more simple method be preferred, clean and dry the fish well, 
cut off the heads and tails, take out the backbones, cut each fish 
in three, egg and crumb thepo, fry them in boiling lard a fine 
golden brown, and serve them, well drained and dned, wiUi the 
same sauces as boiled haddocks. 

TO DRESS FINNAN HADDOCKS. 

These are slightly salted, and dried. The^r are excellent 
eating, if gently heated through upon the gridiron without 
being hardened, and are served usually as a relish at the break- 
fast or supper table ; a feather dipped in oil may be passed over 
them before they are laid to the fire. 

FBESH HEBBINGS.

mace ; stick small bits of butter on them and skewer two of the 
fish together as flat as possible, with the skin of both outside;

water ; add salt, and saltpetre in the same proporticm as for cod 
fish, and let them just simmer for four or five minutes after the 
water first b^ins to boil, or Jonger, should their size require it, 
but guard against their being broken. Serve them with plain 
melted butter. 

4 to 5 minutes ; longer if needful. 

TO FBT PLAICE OB FLOUNOEBS. 

Sprinkle them with salt, and let them lie for two or three 
hours before they are dressed. Wash and clean them tho- 
roughly, wipe them very dry, flour them well, and wipe them 
again with a clean cloth ; dip them into egg, and fine bread- 
crumbs, and fry them in plenty of lard. If the fish be large, 
raise the -flesh in handsome fillets from the bones, and finish 
them as directed for fillets of soles. 

Obs. — Plaice is said to be rendered less watenr by beating it 
gently with a paste-roller before it is cooked. It is very sweet 
and pleasant in flavour while it is in the best season, which is 
from the end of May to about September. 

TO BOAST, BABE, OB BBOIL BED MULLET. 
In best season through the summer : may be had all the year. 

First wash, and then dry the fish thoroughly in a cloth, 
but neither scale nor open it ; wrap it closely m a sheet of 
thickly buttered paper, tie this securely at the ends, and over 
the mullet with packthread, and roast it in a Dutch oven, or 
broil it over a clear and gentle fire, or bake it in a moderate 
oven : from twenty to thirtjr minutes will be sufiUcient generally 
to dress it in either way, if it be oiily of moderate size. For 
sauce, put into a little good melted butter the liquor which has 
flowed from fish, a small dessertspoonful of essence of anchovies, 
some cayenne, a glass of port wine, or claret, and a little lemon- 
joioe. Remove uie packthread, and send the mullet to table in

dished without the paper, for dinners of high taste. 
20 to 30 minutes. 

TO BOIL GBET MULUiT, 

This fish varies so much in size and quality, that it is difficult 
to give exact directions for the time of cookmg it. When quite 
young and small, it may he boiled by the receipt for whitings, 
haddocks, and other fish of about their size ; but at its finest 
growth it must be laid into cold water, and managed like larger 
fish. We have ourselves partaken of one whidi was caught 
upon our eastern coast, that weighed ten pounds, of which the 
flesh was quite equal to that of salhion, but its we^ht was, we 
believe, an unusual one. Anchovy, or caper fish sauce, with 
melted butter, may be sent to table with grey mullet. 

TO FBT SMELTS. 
In fleaton flpom beginning of Norember to May. 

Smelts when quite fiiesh have a perfume resembling that of a 
cucumber, and a peculiarly delicate and agreeable flavour when 
dressed. Draw them at the gills, as they must not be opened ; 
wash and dry them thoroughly in a cloth ; dip them into beaten 
egg-yolk, and then into the finest bread-crumbs, mixed with 
a small quantity of flour ; fry them of a clear golden brown, 
and serve them very crisp and dry, with good melted butter 
in a tureen. They are sometimes mpped into batter and then 
firied; when this is done, we would recommend for them the 
French batter of Chapter IV . 

3 to 4 minutes. 

BAKSp SMELTS. 

Prepare them as for fiying ; pour some clarified butter into 
the dish in which they are to be sent to table, arrange them 
neatiy in it, with the tails meeting in the centre, strew over 
them as much salt, mace, and cayenne, mixed, as will season 
them agreeably, cover them smoothly with a rather thick 
layer of very fine bread-crumbs, moisten them equally with 
clarified butter poured through a small strainer, and bake the 
fish in a moderately quick oven, until the crumbs are of a fine 
light brown. A glass of sherry, a half-teaspoonfiol of essence 
of anchovies, and a dessertspoohful of lemon-juice, are some- 
times poured into the dish before the amdts are laid in. 

About 10 minutes.

WATEB SOUGHT. 

{Greenwich Receipt^ 

This is a very simple and inexpensive dish, much served at 
the regular fish-dinners for which Gre^wich is celebrated, as 
^ as at private tables. It is excdlent if well prepared ; and 
K it may be made with fish of various kinds when they are too 
Boall to present a ^ood appearance, or to be palatable, dressed 
in any ether way, it is also very economical, f'lounders, perch, . 
tench, and eels, are said to answer best for water souchy ; but 
Teiy delicate soles, and several other varieties of smau white 
&h are ofbm used for it with good effect : it is sometimes made 
lift) irith dices of salmon, or of salmon-peel, freed from the 
ikin. 

Throw into rather more than sufficient water to just cover 
the quantity of fish required for table firom half to three quarters 
of an ounce of salt to the quart, a dozen corns of white pepper, 
a small Inmch of green parsley, and two or three tender parsley- 
roots, first cut into inch lengths, and then split to the size of 
itrawB. Simmer the mixture until these last are tender, which 
^ be in from half to a whole hour; then lay in the fish 
delicately cleaned, cleared from every morsel of brown skin, 
and divided into equal portions of about two inches in width. 
Take off all the scum as it rises, and stew the fish softly firom 
^ht to twelve minutes, watching it that it may not bresuL fix>m

the trout, skim the fat firom the gravy, and pass it through a 



strainer over the fish, which should be served immediately. 
A little acid can be added to the sauce at pleasure, and a glass 
of ivine when it is considered an improvement. This receipt is 
for one large, or for two middling-sused fish. We can lecom- 
n»Dd it as a good one, from our own experience. 

Batter, 3 ozs. ; flour, 1 tablespoonM ; seasoning of mace, 
cayenne, and nutmeg ; trout, 1 large, or 2 moderate sized ; veal 
stock, I pint; parsley, smail fiiggot; 1 bay-leaf; roll of lonon- 
lind; little salt : } to f hour. 

Ok— Trout may be stewed in equal parts of strong veal 
grsTy, and of red or white wine, without having been previously 
browned; the sauce should then be thickenraf and agreeabljr 
^voored with lemoii-juice, and the usual store-sauces, before it 
is poored over the fish. They are also good when wrapped in 
battered paper and baked or broiled : il very small, the better 
mode of cooking them is to fry them whole. They should never 
be plain boiled, as, though a naturally delicious fish, they are 
tben very inHipiil.

Modenle nied, | hour ; laige, 1 hour. 

06f . — ^We most repeat that it w imposBible to give for fish 
whidi varies so much in quality as well as in size, directions for 
the exact time which is required to cook it; a few minutes, 
more or less, mjist often be allowed ; and it should always be 
watdied attentively, and lifted from the water as soon as it is 
done. 

TO BAKB PIKE. 

(^Common Receipt,^ 

Four warm water over the outside of the fish, and wipe it 
very clean with a coarse doth drawn from the head downwards, 
that the scales may not \)e disturbed ; then wash it well in cold 
water, empty, and dean the inside with the greatest nicety, fill 
it dther imh the common forcemeat, No. 1, or with No. 4, of 
Chapter YI., sew it up, fiisten the tail to the mouth, give it a 
slight dredging of flour, stick small bits of butter thickly over 
it, and bake it from half to three quarters of an hour, should it 
be of moderate size, and upwards of an hour, if it be large. 
Should there not be sufficient sauce with it in the dish, plain 
melted butter, and a lemon, or anchovy sauce may be sent to 
table with it. When more convenient, the forcemeat may be 
omitted, and a little fine salt and cayenne, with some bits of 
butter, put into the inside of the fish, which will then require 
rather less baking. A buttered paper should always be laid 
over it in the oven, should the outside appear likely to become 
too highly coloured, or too dry, before the fish is done ; and it 
is better to wrap quite small pike in buttered paper at once, be- 
fore they are sent to the oven. 

Moderate-sized pike, SO to 45 minutes; large pike, 1 to 1^ 
hour. 

TO BAKE PIKE. 

(Superior ReceipL) 

Scale and wash the fish, take out the gills, then open it just 
snffidently to allow the inside to be emptied, and perfectly 
cleansed, but not more than is necessary for that purpose. 
Wipe it as dry as possible in every part, then haii^ it for an 
hour or two on a nook in a cool larder, or wrap it in a soft 
doth. Fill the body with the forcemeat No. 1 or 3, or with 
the ojrster forcemeat of Chapter VI. ; sew it up veiy securdy, 
curl It round, and fasten the tail into the mouth with a tiun 
skewer, then dip it into the beaten yolks of two or more eggSj 
seasoneid with nearly a half-teaspoonful of sidt and a litde

pepper or cay^exme ; oover it equally with the finest bread- 
erombs ; dip it a seeond time into the ^g and crumba, then 
poor some dariiied butter eently over it, through a small 
itramer, and send it to a weU heated oyen for an hour and a 
quarter or more, should it be veri/ large, but for less time if it 
be only of moderate size. As it is naturally a very diy fish, it 
should not be left in the oven after it is thoroughly done, but it 
should never be sent to table until it is so. Tne crumbs of 
bread are sometimes mixed with a sufficient quantity of minced 
panley to ffive the surface of the fish a green hue. Send 
plain meltea butter, and brown caper, or Dutoh sauce to table 
withit 

TO BOIL FEBCH. 

First wipe or wash off the slime, then scrape off the scales, 
which adheres rather tenaciously to this fish ; empty and clean 
the ioaides perfectly,#take out tne gills, cut off the fins, and lay 
the perch into equal parts of cold and of boiling water, salted as 
6r mackerel : fix>m eight to ten minutes will boil them unless 
they are very large. Dish them on a napkin, garnish them with 
curled parsley, and serve melted butter with them or Mdiire 
(^ Hotel sauce maigre, 

Very good French cooks put them at once into boiling water, 
>nd keep them over a brisk fire for about fifteen minutes. 
They dress them also without taking off the scales or fins until 
tbej are ready to serve, when they strip the whole of the skin 
off carefully, and stick the red fins into the middle of the backs; 
the fish are then covered with the Steward's sauce, thickened 
with eggs. 

In warm water, 8 to 10 minutes, in boiling, 12 to 15. 

TO FBT PEBCH OB TENCH.

them in boiling lard. Serve plenty of fined parsley round 

them.

them to table with plain melted butter and a lemon, or the 
sauce-cruets. Eels are sometimes dipped into batter and then 
fried ; or into egg and fine bread-crumbs (mixed with minced 
parsley or not, at pleasure), and served with plenty .of crisped 
parsley ronnd^ and on thei! ' 

It is an improvement for these modes of dressing the fish to 
open them entirely and remove the bones : the smaller parts 
should be thrown into the pan a minute or two later than the 
thicker portions of the bodies or they will not be equally done. 

BOILED EELS. 

(German Receipt^ 

Pare a fine lemon, and strip from it entirely the white inner 
rind, slice it, and remove the pips with care, put it with a blade 
of mace, a small half-teaspoonful of white peppercorns, nearly 
twice as much of salt, and a moderate-sized bunch of parsley, 
into three pints of cold water, bring them gently \o boil, and 
simmer them for twenty minutes ; let them become quite cold, 
then put in three pounds of eels skinned, and cleaned with 
great nicety, and cut into lengths of three or four inches ; 
simmer them very softly from ten to fifteen minutes, lift them 
with a slice into a very hot dish, and serve them with a good 
Dutch sauce, or with parsley and butter acidulated with lemon- 
juice, or with Chili vinegar. 

EELS. 

(Cornish ReceipL) 

Skin, empty, and wash as clean as possible, two or three fine 
eels, cut them into short lengths, and just cover them with cold 
water ; add sufiicient salt and cayenne to season them, and stew 
them very softly indeed from fifteen to twenty minutes, or 
longer should tney require it. When they are nearly done, 
strew over them a tablespoonful of minced parsley, thicken the 
sauce with a teaspoonftil of flour mixed with a slice of butter, 
and add a quarter-pint or more of clotted cream. Give the 
whole a boil, lift me fish into a hot dish, and stir briskly 
the juice of half a lemon into the sauce; pour it upon the eels, 
and serve them immediately. Very sweet thick cream is, we 
think, preferable to clotted cream for this dish. The sauce 
should be of a good consistence, and a dessertspoonftil of flour 
will be needed for a large dish of the stew, and from one and a 
half to two ounces of butter. The size of the fish must deter- 
mine the precise quantity of liquid and of seasoning which they 
will require. 



CHAP, n.] FISH. 75 

By sabstitntiiig pale veal gravy for water, and thin strips of 
kmon-rind for the parsley, this may be conyerted into a white 
fiicassee of eels : a flavouring of maoe must then be added to it, 
and the beaten yolks of two or three ^gs mixed with a couple 
ofspoonsfiil of cream, must be stirred into the sauce before uie 
lemon-juice, but it must on no account be allowed to boil after- 
irards. Bich brown gravy and port wine highly spiced, with 
add as above, will give another variety of stewed eels.. For 
this dish the fish are sometunes fried before^ they are laid into 
the sauce. 

TO BOIL LOBSTEB8. 
In season from April to October. 

Choose them by the directions which we have already given 
at the commencement of this chapter, and throw them into 
}hatj of fast-botlmg salt and water, that life may be destroyed 
in an instant. A moderate-sized lobster will be done in from 
fifteen to twenty-five minutes ; a large one in from half an hour 
to forty minutes : before they are sent to table, the large claws 
should be taken off, and tne shells cracked across the joints 
without disfiguring them ; the tail should be separated from the 
hody and s^t quite through the middle ; the whole neatly 
dished upon a napkin, and garnished with curled parsley or 
not, at choice. A good remoulade, or any other sauce of the 
land, that may be preferred, should be sent to table with it ; or 
oil and ChiU vinegar, when better liked. 

To 1 gallon water 5 ozs. salt. Moderate-sized lobster, 15 to 
25 minutes. Large lobster, 30 to 40 minutes. 

LOBSTSB 7BIGASSBED, OB AU Bl^CHAMBL. (eNTB^E.) 

Take the flesh from the claws and tails of two moderate-sized 
lobsters, cut it intd small thick slices or dice; heat it slowly 
quite through in about three quarters of a pint of good white 
sauce or bechamel ; and serve it when it is at the point of boilio^, 
After having stirred briskly to it a little lemon-juice, just as it is 
taken from the fire. The coral, pounded and mixed gradually 
^th a few spoonsfiil of the sauce, should be added previously. 
Good shin of beef stock, made without vegetables (see page 34), 
and somewhat reduced by quick boiling, if mixed with an equal 
proportion of cream, and thickened with arrow-root, will answer 
extremely well, in a general way, for this dish, which is most 
excellent if well made. The sauce should never be thin ; nor 
more than sufficient in quantity to just cover the fish. For a 
Becond course dish only as muJch must be used as will adhere to

the fish, which after hdng heated should he laid evenly into the 
shells after they haye heoi split quite through the centre of the 
hacks in their entire length, without heing broken or divided at 
the joint, and nicely detuied. When thus anraneed, the lobster 
may be thickly covered with well-dried, fine, pale, fried crumbs 
of bread ; or with imfiried ones, which must then be equally 
moistened with clarified butter, and browned with a salamander. 
A small quantity of adt, nmoe, and cayenne, ma^ be required 
to finish the flavouring of either of these preparations. 

BUTTEBXD CRAB, OB liOBSTEB. 

In feMon during the nme time as Lobcten. 

Slice quite small, or pull into light flakes with a couple of 
forks, the flesh of either fish ; put it into a saucepan with a few 
bits of good butter lightly rol^ in flour, and neat it slowly 
over a gentle fire ; then pour over and mix thoroughly with it, 
from one to two teaspoonsful of made^mustard smoothly blended 
with a tablespoonfiil or more of common or of Chili vmegar : if 
with the former, add to it a tolerable seasoning of cayenne. 
Grate in a little nutmeg, and when the whole is well heated 
serve it immediately either in the shell of the crab or lobster, or 
in scollop-shells, and serve it plain, or with bread-crumbs over, 
as in the preceding receipt. A spoonfrd or so of good meat jelly 
is, we think, a great improvement to this dish, for which an ounce 
and a half of butter will be quite sufficient. 

Crabs are boiled like lobsters. 

TO BOn. CBATITSH. 

Throw them into water salted as for lobsters, and when they 
have boiled a quarter of an hour, take them up, and drain tb^ m 
well. 

15 minutes. 

TO BOIL PRAWNS. 

Let them have plenty of water salted as fbr shrimps, pmt 
^em in when it is boilii^r fast, dear off all the scum as n rises, 
and in from six to eight minutes turn them into a cullender or 
sieve, and drain them well. Spread them on^a huge dish or on 
a soft doth to cool, and when they are quite' cold, dress them 
upon a very white napkin neatly arranged upon a saucer or 
arnaU basin reversed in a dish. Garnish the base with curled i 
parsley, and send the prawns to table. They should always be 
kept m a very cool place until they axe served. 

6 to 8 minutes.

TO BOIL 8HBDCP8. 

Pick out the large ones, and let the smaller be thrown back 
into the sea. Have ready boiling plenty of water, add salt in 
the proportion of from five to six ounces to the gallon, take off 
the scnm, put in the shrimps, and in four or five minutes they 
^ be done. Pour them into a cullender to drain, then spread 
them on a soft doth to cool ; or, dish them directly on a napkin 
and send them hot to table. 

4 to 5 minutes. 

06f .— Keady-dressed shrimps or prawns may be preserved fit 
for eating at least twelve hours longer than they would other- 
wise keep, by throwing them for an instant into boiling salt and 
water when they first b^in to loose their freshness, and then 
draining them as above. 

CBOUTE ATJX CBEVETTES, OB 8HBIMP-TOAST. 

Shell two quarts of fine fresh shrunps, bruise the heads, and 
hoil them in a pint and a half of water for half an hour ; then 
strain the liquor through a muslin, or very fine sieve. Set two 
ounces of butter over the fire in a saucepan, and when it begins 
to smunel*, stir in a teaspoonful of flour, a quarter-spoonfriT of 
mace in powder, some cayenne, and a little grated nutmeg, and 
shake the whole ofren until the flour begins to brovm; then 
pour in by degrees the liquor in which the heads were stewed, 
and when the sauce boils, add the shrimps ; as soon as they are 
qnite hot through, pour them into a toast made of the bottom 
cmst of a loaf cut more than an inch thick, slightly hollowed 
hi the inside, and fried in fresh butter a light brown. Veal- 
hroth is a good substitute for the liquor made of the heads, 
which has rather a peculiar flavour. A few drops of essence of 
anchovies are considered bymanv persons an improvement to it. 
A glass of sherry, and a little lemon-juice, are also sometimes, 
added to the above : the beaten yolks of two or three eggs 
stirred in just as it is taken from the fire, will be found a good 
addition to it. 

SHBIMP-TOAST A LA BEINE. 

Substitute three quarters of a pint of veal-gravy for the 
ahrimp-liquor of the preceding receipt ; boil in it for ten minutes 
the rmd of a very small lemon cut extremely thin, put the same 
proportion of butter, flour, and spice, as for the Croute auz 
Crevettes, but pour the gravv to them before the roux begins 
to browiL Have ready-boilmg, a quarter-pint of rich cream.

mix it with the other ingredients, put in the shrimps, and add a

Sloak the crust before it is fried, in a little cold cream ; or toast, 
and butter it, and then moisten it well with boiling cream.

OTSTEBS. 
In leafon from September to April. 
The old-fashioned plan oi feeding oysters with a sprinkling 
of oatmeal or flour, in addition to me salt and water to which 
they were conunitted, has long been rejected by all genuine 
amateurs of these nutritious and excellent fish, who consider the 
plumpness which the oysters are supposed to gain from the 
process but poor compensation fbr the flavour which they are 
sure to lose. To cleanse them when they first come up from 
the beds, and to keep them in good condition fqr four or five 
days, they only require to be covered with cold water, with five 
ounces of salt to the gallon dissolved in it before it is poured on 
them: this should be changed with regularity every twenty- 
four hours. By following this plan with exactness they may be 
kept alive from a week to ten days, but will remain in perfect 
condition scarcely more than half that time. Ovsters should be 
eaten always the instant they are opened. They are served 
often before the soup, in the first course of a dinner, left upon 
their shells, and arranged usually in as many plates as there are 
guests at table. 

TO STEW OTSTEBS. 

A pint of small plump o^^sters will be sufficient for quite a 
moderate-sized dish, but twice as many will be reqiured for a 
*lar^e one. Let them be very carefully op^ied, and not mangled 
in the slightest degree ; wash them free from grit in their own 
strained fiquor, lay them into a very dean stewpan or well-tin- 
ned saucepan, stram the liquor a second time, pour it on them, 
and heat them slowly in it. When they are just beginning to 
simmer, lift them out with a slice or a bored wooden spoon, and 
take off the beards ; add to the liquor a quarter-pint of good 
cream, a seasoning of pounded mace and cayenne, and a uttle 
salt, and when it boils, stir in from one to two ounces of good 
butter, smoothly mixed with a large teaspoonful of flour ; con- 
tinue to stir the sauce until these are perfectly blended with it, 



CHAP, n.] PISH. 79 

then pat in the oysters, and let them remam by the side of the 
fire until they are very hot : they reauire so little cooking, that 
if kept for four or five minutes nearly simmering, they will he 
ready for table, and they are quickly hardened by beinf aUowed 
to boil, or by too much stewing. Serve them gamiwed with 
pale fried sippets. 

Small plump oysters, 1 pint: their own liquor: brought 
slowly to the point of simmering. Cream, | pint ; seasoning of 
pounded mace and cayenne ; salt as needed ; butter, 1 to 2 ozs. ; 
flour, 1 large teaspoonful. ' 

O69.— A little lemon -juice should be stirred quickly into the 
stew just as it is taken fix)m the fire. Another mode of prepar- 
ing this dish is to add the strained liquor of the oysters to about 
an equal quantity of rich bechamd, with a little additional 
thickening ; then to heat them in it, after havins prepared and 
plumped them property. Or : the beards of tne fisn may be 
stewed for half an hour in a little pale yeal gravy, and this, 
when strained and mixol with the oyster-liquor, may be brought 
to the consistency of cream with the French thickening of 
Chapter YI. or, with flour and butter, then seasoned with spice 
tt above : the process should be quite the same in all of these 
i^pts, though the composition of the sauce is varied. Essence 
of anchovies, cavice, ChiU vinegar, or yolks of eggs can be added 
to the taste. 

TO SCALLOP OTSTEBS. 

Large coarse oysters should never be dressed in this way. 
Select small plump ones for the purpose, let them be opened 
f^refnlly, give them a scald in their own liquor, wash them in 
H free from 'grit, and beard them neatly. Butter the sodlop 
((bells and shake some fine bread-crumbs over them ; fill them 
^h alternate layers of oysters, crumbs of bread, and fresh 
butter cut into snuJl bits ; pour in the oyster-liquor, after it has 
been strained, put a thick, smooth layer of bread-crumbs on the 
top, moisten them with clarified butter, place the shells in a 
Butch oven before a clear fire, and turn them often till the tops 
are equally and lightly browned : send them immedmtely to 
table. 

Some persons like a little white pepper or cayenne, and a 
flavouring of nutnieg added to the oysters ; others prefer pounded 
oiace. French cooks reconmiend with them a mixture of 
minced mushrooms stewed in butter till quite tender, and sweet 
herbs finely chopped. The fish is sometimes laid into the shells 
after having been bearded only. 



80 MODERN OOOKEBT. ^CHAP. n. 



SCALLOPED OT8TEB8 A LA BEIKS. 

Plump and beard the oysters, after having rinsed them well 
in their own strained liquor ; add to this about an equal quantity 
of very rich white sauce, and thicken it, if needful, with a hali- 
teaspoonfdl of flour, mixed with a small slice of butter, or with 
as much arrow-root only ; put in the oysters, and keep them at 
the point of simmering for three or four ininutes; lay them into 
the sheUs, and cover the tops thickly with crumbs fried a 
delicate brown and well dried; or heap over them instead, a 
layer of fine crumbs; pour clanfied butter on them, and brown 
them with a salamander. 

OYSTEB SAUSAGES. 

Beard, rinse well in their strained liquor, and mince, but not 
finely, three dozens and a half of plump native oysters, and mix 
them with ten ounces of fine bread-crumbs, and ten of beef-suet 
chopped extremely small ^ add a saltspoonM of salt, and one of 
pepper, or less than half the quantity of cayenne, twice as much 
pounded mace, and the third of a small nutmeg grated ; moisten 
the whole with two unbeaten ^gs, or with the yolks only of 
three, and a dessertspoonM of the whites. When these ingre- 
dients have been well worked together, and are perfectly 
blended, set the mixture in a cool p&ce for two or three hours 
before it is used ; make it into the form of small sausages or 
sausage-cakes, flour and fry them in butter of a fine light 
brown ; or throw them into boiling water for three minutes, 
drain, and let them become cold, dip them into esg and bread- 
crumbs, and broil them gently until they are lightly coloured. 
A small bit should be cooked and tasted before the whole is put 
aside, that the seasoninfr may be heightened if required. The 

«usa^ thus niade are W W. 

Small plump oysters, 3^ dozens ; bread-crumbs, 10 ozs. ; beef- 
suet, 10 ozs. ; seasoning of salt, cayenne, poimded mace, and , 
nutmeg ; unbeaten eggs 2, or yolks of 3. 

Obs. — ^The fingers should be well floured for making up these 
sausages. 

TO FRY OYSTEBS. 

They should be large for this piu*pose. Simmer them for a 
couple of minutes in their own liquor, beard and dry them in a 
cloth, dredge them lightly with flour, dip them in egg and fine 
bread-crumbs, and fry them a delicate orown in boning lard ; 
or make a thick batter with ^gs and flour, season it with.

a moderate fire, and serve them on hot buttered toasts, sprinkled 
with a little cayenne. 

BED HEBBIN6S, COMMON ENGLISH MODB. 

ITiig fish is rendered infinitely more delicate by pouring 
boilinff water on it, before it is dressed, and leaving it to soak 
for half an hour, or more, should it be highly dried. The fresh 
Yarmouth bloaters do not require this. Cut off the heads and 
tails, open the herrings at the back, and warm them through 
^fore the fire, or upon the gridiron. They may be mbl^ 
Y^ a bit of cold butter, and seasoned with a slight sprinkling 

^ pepper or cayenne, when these are liked, or served quite 

plain. 

ANCHOVIES FBIED IN BA1TEB* 

Scrape very clean a dozen or more of fine anchovies, and 
"oak tnem in plenty of spring water from two to six hours ; 
then wipe them dry, open them, and take out the back-bones, 
without dividing the fish. Season the insides his^hly with 
cayenne, close the anchovies, dip them into the French batter of

Gravy Kettle. at a triflinff cost, all that is 

generally needed for plain family dinners ; while an unskilfiil 
or extravagant one will render them sources of unbounded 
expense.* But however small the proportions in which they 
are made, their quality should be particularly attended to, and 
they should be well a&pted in flavour to the dishes they are to 
accompanv. For some, a high degree of savour is desirable ; 
but for rricaasees, and other preparations of delicate vrhite 
meats, this should be avoided, and a soft, smooth sauce of 
refined flavour should be used in preference to any of more 
piquant relish. 

Instead of frying the ingredients for brown gravies, which is 
usually done in conunon English kitchens, French cooks pour 
to them at first a small quantity of liquid, which is reduced by 
rapid boiling to what is technically called glaze; particular 
directions for which will be found in the next receipt to 
this, and also at pages 9 and 93. When the glaze 
has aoc][uired the proper colour, boiling broth should be 
added in small portions, and well shaken round the stewpan 
to detach it entirely; the meat may then be stewed gently 
for three or four hours with a few mushrooms, mould 
they be at hand, a bunch of parsley, and some green onions, 
or with a Portugal onion instead. 

A thick slice or two of an unboiled ham, is an almost indis- 
pensable addition to rich soup or eravy ; and to supply it in the 
most economical manner, a large, higmy cured one, or more^not 
over &tted, should be kept for the purpose, and cut as required.

those of the loixi, or neck of veal : and as the flesh of these may 
be dressed in many ways adTantageonaly without them,* the 
wfade joint may be tinned to excellent aooomit by so diyiding it 

The nedm of poultry, with the feet properly skinned, a few 
herbs, a morsel or two of ham or of lean baoon, and such slight 
^roarings beside as the spice box can supply, with a few drops 
of good mushroom catsup, will of themseives, if well managed, 
prodnce sufficient gravy to serve with the Inrds from which tney 
are taJcen; and if not ¥ranted for the purpose, Hhev should 
always be stewed dovm, or thrown into tne stock-pot, for which 
the shank-bones of 1^ of mutton, and all trimmings of meat 
ihoold likewise be reserved. Excellent broth for the sick or for 
the needy, may also be nmde of them at little cost, when they 
sre not required for other uses. 

To deepen the colour of gravies, the thick mushroom presnng* 
of Chapter Y., or a little soy (when its flavour is admissible), or 
cavice, or Harvey's sauce, may be added to it; and for some 
^es, a glass of claret, or of port wine. 

Vennicelli, or rasped cocoa-nut, lightly, and veru gently 
hrowned in a small quantity of butter, will both thicken and 
enrich them, if about an ounce of either to the pint of gravy be 
stewed gently in it from half an hour to an nour, and then 
strained out 

All the ingredients indicated at page 3, for giving consistency 
to soaps, wm answer equally for gravies, which should not, 
howerer, be too much thickened, particularly with the imwhole- 
eome ftaizture of flour and butter, so commonly used for the 
porpose. Arrow-root, or rice-flour, or common flour gradually 
browned in a slow oven, are much better suited to a delicate 
stomach. No particle of fat should ever be perceptible upon 
them when they are sent to table; and when it cannot be 
'onoyed by skimming, they should be allowed to become suffi- 
oeotly cold for it to conseal, and be taken off at once without 
trouble. It may be deaied from sudi as have not been 
thickened, by passmg them through a closely woven doth, 
which has previously been laid into, and well wrung from, some 
cold water.

.mace, two or three cloves, a bay-leaf, a few small spriss of 
saYOury herbs, and an eschalot or two, or about a teaspoomul of 
minced onion, and a little young parsley root, when it can be 
had, will convert common shin ot beef stock, or even strong 
broth, into an excellent gravy, if it be gradually added to them 
after they have stewed i£)wly for quite half an hour, and then 
boiled with them for twenty minutes or more. The liquid 
should not be mixed with the other ingredients until the side of 
the stewpan is coloured of a leddish brown ; and should any 
thickening be required, a teaspoonful of flour should be stirred 
in well, and simmered for three or four minutes before the stock 
is added : the pan should be strongly shaken round afterwards 
to detach the browning from it, and this must be done often 
while the ham is stewing. 

Ob8. — The cook who is not acquainted with this mode of 
preparing or enriching gravies, will do well to make herself 
acquaint^ with it ; as it presents no difficulties, and is exceed- 
ingly convenient and advantageous when they are wanted in 
small quantities, very highly flavoured and well coloured. An 
unboiled ham, kept in cut, will be found, as we have already 
said, a great economy for this, and other purposes, saving much 
of the expense commonly incurred for gravy-meats. As escha- 
lots, when sparingly iised, impart a much finer savour than 
onions, though they are not commonly so much used in 
England, we would recommend that a small store of them 
should always be kept. 

SHIN OF BEEF STOCK. 

(^For Gravies,) 

There is no better foundation for strong gravies than shin of 
beef stewed down to a jelly (which it easily becomes), with the 
addition only of some spice, a bunch of savoury herbs, and a 
moderate proportion of salt ; this, if kept in a cool larder, 
boiled softly for two or three minutes every second or third day, 
and each time put into a clean, well-scalded pan, will remam 
good for many days, and may easily be converted into excellent 
soup or gravy. Let the bone be broken in one or two places, 
• take out the marrow, which, if not wanted for immediate use, 
should be clarified, and stored for future occasions; put a pint 
and a half of cold water to the pound of beef, and stew it very 
gently indeed for six or seven hours, or even longer should the 
meat not then be quite in fragments. The bones of calf's feet 
which have been boiled down for jelly, the liquor in which the 
head has been cooked, and any remains of ham quite freed fr^m

theamoky parts, from rust, and fat, will be semoeable additions 
to this stocK. A couple of pounds of the neck of beef may be 
added to six of the shin with very good effect ; but for white 
nop or sauces this is better avoidecL 
Shin of beef 6 lbs.; water, 9 pints; salt, 1 oz. ; large bunch

BICH PAUB YBAI. OBAVT, OB, COIVSOMM^S. 

The French, who have always at hand their stock-pot of 
good bouillon (beef soup or broth), make great use of it in 
preparing their gravies. It is added instead of water to the 
mk meat, and when this, in somewhat large proportions, is 
ixaled down in it, with tiie addition only of a bunch of parsley, 
a few green onions, and a moderate seasoning of sdt, a strong 
and very pure- flavoured pale gravy is produced. When the 
iKst joints of fowls, or of partridges have been taken for fricas* 
8^ or cutlets, the remainder may be stewed with a pound 
or two of veal into a oonsomm^e, which then takes the name of 
chicken or of game gravy. For a large dinner it is always 
desirable to have in readiness such stock as can easily and 
qmckly be converted into white and other sauces. To make 
this, arrange a slice or two of lean ham in a stewpan or sauce- 
pan with three pounds of the neck of veal once or twice divided 
(unless the thidc fleshy part of the knuckle can be had), and 
pour to them three Am pints of strong beef or veal broth ; or 
if this cannot conveniently be done, increase the proportion of 
loeat or diminish that of the liquid, substituting water for the 
hroth, throw in some salt after the boiling has conunenced, and 
the gravy has been well skimmed, with one mild onion, a bunch 
ofsayoury herbs, a littie celery, if in season, a carrot, a blade of 
loace, and a half-saltspoonM of peppercorns ; stew these very 
g^tly for four hours; then, should the meat be (juite in firag- 
ments, strain off the gravy, and let it become sufficiently cold to 
allow the fat to be entirely cleared from it. A handful of nicely 
prepared mushroom-buttoni will much improve its flavour; 
and the bones of boiled calf s feet, or the fresh ones of fowls 
^1 be found excellent additions to it. A better method of 
leaking it, when time and trouble are not r^arded, is to heat 
the meat, which ought then to be free of bones, quite through, 
^h from a ouarter to half a pint of broth only, and when on 
probing it witn the point of a ^life no blood issues from it, and 
it has been tiprn^ and equally done, to moisten it with the 
i^n^der of the broth, wMch should be boiling. 

Lean of ham, 6 to 8 ozs. ; neck or knuckle of veal, 3 lbs. ;

part of the knuckle or firom the neck (part of the fillet, which 
m France Is often used for it instead, not being generally pur- 
chasable here, the butchers seldom dividing uie joint) ; pom 
to them about half a pint of good broth,* and place the pan 
over a brisk fire until it is well reduced, then thrust a knife 
into the meat, and continue the stewing more gently until a 
glaze Ib formed as we have described at page 93. The latter 
part of the process must be very sUno : the stewpan must be fre- 
quently shaken, and the grayy closely watched that it may not 
bum; when it is of a fine deep amber colour, pour in sumcient 
boiling broth to coyer the meat, add a bundi of parsley, and a 
few mushrooms and green onions. A blade or two of mace, a 
few white peppercorns, and a head of celery, would, we think, 
be yery admissible additions to this grayy, but it is extremely 
ffood without. Half the quantity can be made, but it wiU then 
be rather more troublesome to manage.

A BICH 6BAVT FOB VENISON, 

There are few eaters to whom this would be acceptable, the 
generality of them preferring infinitely the flavour of the venison 
itself to any which the richest gravy made of other meats can 
afford ; but when the savour of a well ma« Espagnole is likely 
to be relished, prepare it by the receipt of the f(Hlowing page, 
substituting plain strong mutton stock for the veal gravy. 

SWEET SAUCE, OB 6BAVT FOB VENISON. 

Add to a quarter-pint of common venison gravy a couple of 
glasses of port wine or claret, and half an ounce of sugar in

Take the same proportion of ingredients as for the preceding 
Espagnole, with the addition, if they should be at hand, of a 
dozen small mushrooms, prepared as for stewing ; when these 
have fried gently in the stewpan until it appears of a reddi^ 
colour all round, stir in a tablespoonfril of flour, and when it is 
lightly browned, add in small portions, letting each one boil up 
before the next is poured in, and shaking the pan well round, 
three quarters of a pint of hot and good veal gravy, and nearly 
half a pint of Madeira or sherry. When the sauce has boiled 
gently for half an hour, add to it a small quantity of cayenne, 
and some salt, if this last be needed ; then straui it, skim off the 
£at entirely, should any appear upon the surface, and serve it 
veiy hot. A smaller proportion of wine, added a few minutes 
before the sauce is r^y for table, would perhaps better suit 
with £nglish taste, as with longer boiling, its flavour passes off 
almost entirely. Either of these Espagnoles, poured over the 
irell bruised remains of pheasants, partridges, or moor fowl, and 
boiled with them for an hour, will become a most admirable 
game gravy, and would generally be considered a superlative 
addition to other roast birds of their kind, as well as to the hash

having cut it small, in half a pint of water with any slight 
seasonings of spice or herbs, or with a little salt and pepper

quantity will be too much reduced. When the bird is just 
ready for table, take the gravy from the dripping-pan, and 
drain ofi^the fiit from it as closely as possible ; strain the Uquor 
from the neck to it, mixing them smoothly, pass the gravy 
again through the strainer, heat it, add sidt and pepper or 
cayenne, if needed, and serve it extremely hot When this is 
done, the fowl should be basted with good butter only, and 
well floured when it is first laid to the fire. Many cooks always 
mix the gravy from the pan when game is roasted with that 
which they send to table with it, as ihey think that this enriches 
the flavour ; but it is not always considered an improvement by 
the eaters.

then pour gradually to them between half and three quarters of 
a pint of boiling water ; add a not very ^ill seasonmg of salt 
and pepper, and stew the gravy very gently for upwards of an 
hour and a half. Strain, and skim off the fat, and it will be 
leady for table. When it is to accompany ducks or geese, 
brown a minced onion with the melt, and add a sprig of lemon 
thyme. This, though a very cheap, is a rich myy m flavour; 
but it would be infmitely improved by using for it equal parts 
of neck of beef (or of beef steak) and sheep's melt ; or the 
bone and the lean only of a thick mutton cutlet. A little 
catsap, or a very small quantity of spice, wiU likewise be good 
addttioDB to it; and a slice or two of a root of celery, and of a 
carrot, might be boiled down with the meat. A bit or two of

MEAT JELLIES FOB PIES A10> SAUCES. 

A very firm meat jelly is easily made by stewing slowly down 
equal parts of shin of bee^ and knuckle or neck of veal, with a 
pint 01 cold water to each pound of meat ; but to give it flavour, 
some thick slices of lean unboiled ham should be added to it, 
two or three carrots, some spice, a bunch of parsley, one mild 
onion, or more, and a moderate quantity of salt ; or part of the 
meat may be omitted, and a cau *s head, or the scalp of one, 
very advantageously substituted for it, though the flavouring 
must then be heightened, because, though very gelatinous, these 
are in themselves exceedingly insipid to the taste. If rapidly 
boiled, the jelly will not be clear, and it will be difficult to ren- 
der it so without clarifying it with the whites of eggs, which it 
ought never to require ; if very gently stewed, on me contrarv, 
it will only need to be passed through a fine sieve, or cloth. 
The fat must be carefully removed, alter it is quite cold. The 
shin of beef recommended for this and other receipts, should

be from the middle of the 1^ of young heifer beef, not of that 
which is large and coarse. 

Middle of small shin of beef, 3 lbs. ; knuckle or neck of veal,

spoon^ of peppercorns ; salt, f oz. (more if needed) : 5 to 6 
boars' very gentle Istevdng. 

Obs» — A finer jelly may be made by using a laiger propor- 
tion of veal than of beef,, and by addmg clear beer or 
veal broth to it instead of water, in a small proportion 
at first, as directed in the receipt for consomm^e, see page 
85, and by pouring in the remainder when the meat is heated 
through. The necks of poultry, any inferior joints of them 
omitted from a fricassee, or other dish, or an old fowl, will fur- 
ther improve it much ; an eschalot or two may at choice be 
boiled down in it, instead of the onion, but the flavour should 
be scarcely perceptible. 

A CHEAPEB MEAT JTELLT. 

One calTs foot, a pound and a half or two pounds of neck of 
veal or beef, a sniall onion, a carrot, a bunch of parsley, a'fittle 
spice, a bit or two of quite lean ham, dressed or undr^ed, and 
five half pints of water, boiled very slowly for five or six hours 
will give a strong, though not a highly flavoured jelly. More 
ham, any bones of imboiled meat, poultry, or game will, in this 
respect, improve it ; and the liquor in wnich fowls or veal have 
been boiled for table should, when at hand, be used for it 
instead of water. These jellies keep much better and longer 
when no vegetables are stewed dovni in them. 

GIAZE. 

This is merely strong, clear, gravy or jelly boiled quickly 
down to the consistency of thin cream ; but this reduction must 
be carefrilly managed that the glaze may be brought to the 
proper point without being burned; it must be attentively 
watched, and stirred without being quitted for a moment from 
the time of its beginning to thicKen; when it has reached the 
proper degree of boiling, it will jelly in dropping from the 
spoon, like preserve, and should then be poured out immediately, 
or it will bum. When wanted for use, melt it gentlv by placing 
the vessel which contains it (see article Glazing, Chapter VII.) 
in a pan of boiling water, and with a paste-brush lay it on to 
the meat, upon which it will form a sort of clear varnish. In

consequence of the veiy gr^t reduction which it undergo^, salt 
shoula be added to it sparingly when it is made. Any kind of 
stock may be boiled down to glaze; but unless it be strong, a 
pint will afford but a spoonfid or two ; a small quantity of it, 
Sowever, is generally sufficient, unless a large repast is to be 
served. Two or three layers must be given to each joint. The 
jellies which precede this will answer ror it extremely well; and 
It may be made also with shin of beef stodc, ror tv^minftn 
occasions, when no other is at hand. 

ASPIC, OB CUSAB SAVOUBT-JXLLT. 

Boil a couple of calTs feet, with three or four pounds of 
knuckle of veal, three quarters of a pound of lean ham, two 
large onions, three whole carrots, and a large bunch of herbs, 
in a gallon of water, till it is reduced more than half. Strain it 
off; when perfectly cold, remove every particle of faX and 
sediment, and put the jelly into a very clean stewnan, with four 
whites of eggs well beaten ; keep it stirred untu it is nearly 
boiling; then place it by the side of the fire to simmer for a 
quarter of an nour. Let it settle, and pour it through a jeUy- 
bag until it is quite dear. Add, when it first b^ins to boil^ 
three blades, of mace, a teaspoonful of white peppercorns, and 
sufficient salt to flavour it properly, allowing for the ham, and 
the reduction. French cooks flavour this jelly wiUi tarragon 
vinegar when it is clarified : cold poultry, game, and fish are 
served in, or garnished with it ; when it is to be moulded, with 
slices of boiled tongue laid in the middle in a chain, or carved 
fowl, or aught else, it will be well to throw in a pinch of isin- 
glass ; and nams are often placed on a thick layer of it roughed^ 
and then covered entirely with more for large breakfasts, or cold 
repasts. It is also used as gravy for meat pies.

them as hot as possible, they not only eive a heightened relish 
to a dinner, but they proye that both skill and taste have been 
exerted in its arrangements. When coarsely or carelessly pre- 
pared, on the contrary, as they too often are, they greatly 
^iseredit the cook, and are anythmg but acceptable to the eaters. 
Melted batter, the most common of all, — the ** one sauee** of 
Sogland, which excites the raillery of foreigners, — ^is freauently 
feuod to be such an intolerable compound, either oued or 
lummr, or composed principally of flour and water, that it says 
bot little for the state of cooKery amongst us. We trust that 
fbe receipts in the present chapter are so clearly giyen, that 
if strictly' followed tney will materially assist the learner in 
Preparing tolerably palatable sauces at the least. The cut at 
the commencement of the chapter exhibits the yessel called a 
^ marie^ in which saucepans are placed when it is necessary 
to keep their contents hot without allowing them to boil : it is 
extremely useful when dinners are delayed after they are ready 
to serve. 

TO THICXEN SAUCES. 

When this is done with the yolks of e^^ thejr should first be 
^U beaten, and then mixed with a spoonM of cold stock, 
shoold it be at hand, and with one or two of the boiling sauce, 
which should be stirred very quickly to them, and they must in 
tnm be stirred briskly to the sauce, which may be held over the 
fire, and well shaken for an instant afterwards, but never placed 
vpon it,' nor allowed to boil.

or other liquid whicli is to be mixed with it should be poured 
boiling, and in small quantities, the saucepan being oi^n well 
shaken round, and the sauce made to boil up ailer each portion 
is added. If this precaution be observed, the butter will never 
float upon the surmce, but the whole will be well and smoothly 
blended : it will otherwise be difficult to dear the sauce from it 
perfectly. 

For invalids, or persons who object to butter in their soups or 
sauces, flour only, mixed to a smooth batter and stirred into the 
boiling liquid, may be substituted for other thickening : arrow- 
root USX), used in the same way, will answer even better than 
flour. 

FRENCH thickening; OB, BBOWN BOUX. 

For ordinary purposes this may be made as it is wanted for 
use ; but when it is required for various dishes at the same time, 
or for cookery upon a large scale, it can be prepared at once in 
sufficient quantity to last for several days, and it will remain good 
for some time. . Dissolve with a very gentle degree of heat, half 
a pound of good butter, then draw it from the fire, skim it well, 
give time for it to settle, pour it gently from the sediment into a 
very clean frying-pan, and place it over a slow but clear fire. 
Put into a dred^ng box about seven ounces of fine dry flour ; 
add it graduallv to the butter, shake the pan often as it is 
thrown in, and keep the thickening constantly stirred until it has 
acquired a clear light brown colour. It should be very slowly 
and equally done, or its flavour will be unpleasant. Pour it 
into a jar, and stir a spoonful or two as it is needed into boiling 
soup or ^ravy. When the butter is not clarified it will absoib 
an additional ounce of flour, the whole of which ou^ht to be 
fine and dry. This thickening may be made in a well-tinned 
stewpan even better than in a frying-pan, and if simmered over 
a cosd fire it should be placed high above it, and well guarded 
from smoke. 

WHITE BOUX, OB FBB!NCH THICKSNINO. 

Proceed exactly as for the jjrecedinff receipt, but dredge in 
the flour as soon as the butter is in full simmer, and be csfeful 
not to allow the thickening to take the slightest colour : this is 
used for white gravies or sauces. 

SAUCE TOUBNEB, OB, PAUB THICKENED GBAVT. 

Sauce toum6e is nothing more than rich pale gravy made with 
veal or poultry (see oonsomm^e, page 85) and . thickened with 



CHAP. lY.] SAUCES. 07 

delicate white rooz. The French give it a flavourinj^ of mush- 
rooms and green onions, hy hoiling some of each in it for about 
half an hour before the sauce is served; it must then be strained, 
preyiously to being dished. Either first dissolve an ounce of 
batter, and then dredge gradually to it three quarters of an 
oimce of flour, and proceed as for the preceding receipt ; or 
blend the flour and butter perfectly with a knife, before they 
are thrown into the stewpan, and keep them stirred without 
ceasing over a dear and gentle fire until they have simmered 
for some minutes, then place the stewpan high over the fire, and 
shake it constantly until the roux has lost the raw taste of the 
floor ; next, stir very gradually to it a pint of the gravy, which 
should be boiling : set it by the side of the stove for a few mi- 
nutes, and skim it thoroughly. 

Batter, 1 oz. ; flour, | oz. ; strong, pale gravy, seasoned with 
mushrooms and green onions, 1 pint. 

Obs. 3. — With the addition of three or four yolks of very 
fiesh ^s, mixed with a seasoning of mace, cayenne, and lemon- 
jnice, tMs becomes German saiice, now much used for fricassees, 
and oUier dishes ; and minced parsley (boiled) and Chili vine^, 
each in sufficient quantity to flavour it agreeably, convert it mto 
a good fish sauce. 

BECHAMEL. 

This is a fine French white sauce, now very much served at 
good English tables. It ma^ be made in various ways, and 
more or less expensively ; but it should always be thick, smooth, 
and rich, though delicate in flavour. The most ready mode of 
preparing it, is to take an equal proportion of very strong, pale 
veal gravy, and of good cream (a pint of each, for example), and 
then by rapid boiling over a very clear fire, to reduce the gravy 
nearly half; next, to mix with part of the cream a tablespoonfiil 
of fine dry flour, to pour it to the remainder, when it boils, and 
to keep the whole stirred for five minutes or more over a slow 
fire, for if placed upon a fierce one, it would be liable to bum ; 
then to add the gravy, to stir and mix the sauce perfectly, and to 
simmer it for a few minutes longer. All the flavour snould be 
given by the gravy, in which French cooks boil a handful of 
mushrooms, a few green onions, and some branches of parsley 
before it is reduced : but a good bechamel may be made without 
them, with a strong consommee. (See pale v€m gravy, page 85) 
well reduced.

pint : reduced half. Rich cream, 1 pint ; floor, 1 tablespoonful : 
6 minutes. With gravy, 4 or 5 minutes. 

Obs, — VeloutSy which is a rather thinner sauce or gravy, is 
made by simply well reducing the cream and stock separately, 
and then mixing them together without any thickening. 

BECHAMEIi MAIGSE. 

{A cheap White Sauce.) 

A good bechamel may be made entirely without meat, when 
economy is an object, or when no gravy is at hand. Put into 
a stewpan, or a well tinned and thick saucepan, with from two 
to three ounces of butter, a carrot, and a couple of small onions, 
cut in slices, with a handful of nicely-cleaned mushroom-but- 
tons, when these last can be easily procured ; and when they 
have stewed slowly for half an hour, or until the butter is nearly 
dried up, stir in two tablespoonsfiil of flour, and pour in a pint 
of new milk, a little at a time, shaking the stewpan well round, 
that the sauce may be smooth. Boil the bechamel gently for 
half an hour ; add a little salt, and cayenne ; strain, and reduce 
it, if not quite thick, or pour it boiling to the yolks of two &esh 

ANOTHEB COMMON BECHAM£li. 

Cut half a pound of veal, and a slice of lean ham into small 
dice, and stew them in butter, with vegetables, as directed in the 
foregoing receipt : stir in the same proportion of flour, then add 
the milk, and let the sauce boil very gently for an hour. It 
should not be allowed to thicken too much before it is strained. 

Obs. — Common bechamel, with the addition of a spoonful of 
made-mustard, is an excellent sauce for boiled mutton. 

EICH MELTED BUTTEB. 

This is more particularly required in general for lobster sauce, 
when it is to be served with turbot or brill, and for good oyster 
sauce as well. Salmon is itself so rich, that less butter is needed 
for it than for sauce which is to accompany a drier fish. 'Mis. 
to a very smooth batter a dessert^oonfiil of flour, a half-salt- 
spoonM of salt, and half a pint of cold water ; put these into a 
delicately clean saucepan, with from four to six ounces of well- 
flavoured butter, cut into small bits, and shake the sauce strongly 
round, almost without cessation, until the ingredients are per- 
fectly blended, and it is on the point of boiling ; let it simmer 
for two or three minutes, and it will be ready for use. The 
best French cooks recommend its not being allowed to boil, ^

say it tastes less of flour if served when it is just at the 
poiiit of simmering. 

Cold water, i pint ; salt, ^ spoonM; flour, 1 dessertspoonful : 
3 to 4 minutes. Butter ; 4 to 6 ozs. 

Bf£LTEI> BTJTTEB. 

(^A good common Recent.) 

Put into a basin a large teaspoonfiil of flour, and a little salt, 
then mix with them very gradually and very smoothly a quar- 
ter-pint of cold water ; turn these into a small clean saucepan, 
Ukd diake or stir them constantly over a clear fire until they 
have boiled a couple of minutes, then add an ounce and a 
lialf of butter cut small, keep the sauce stirred until this is 
entiidy dissolved, give the whole a minute*s boil, and serve it 
q\iickly. The more usual mode is to put the butter in at first 
with the flour and water ; but for inexperienced or unskilful 
coob the safer plan is to follow the present receipt. 

Water, I pint ; flour, 1 teaspoonfal : 2 minutes. Butter, 1 1 
02. : 1 minute. 

Obs.— To render this a rich sauce, increase or even douUe the 
proportion of butter. 

FRENCH MELTED BUTTEB. 

Pour half a pint of good, but not very thick, boiling melted 
batter, to the well-beaten yolks of two very fresh eggs, and stir 
them briskly as it is added ; put the sauce a^ain into the sauce- 
pan, and shake it high over the fire for an instant, but do not 
allow it to boil, or it will curdle. Add a little lemon-juice or 
vinegar, and serve it immediately. 

SOSFOLK SAUCE, OB, BICH MELTED BUTTEB WTTHOUT FLOUB. 

Put three tablespoonsful of water into a small saucepan, and 
when it boils add four ounces of fresh butter ; as soon as this 
is quite dissolved, take the saucepan from the fire and shake it 
round until the sauce looks thick and smooth. ' It must not be 
allowed to boil after the butter is added. 

Water, 3 tablespoonsful ; butter, 4 ozs. 

WHITE MELTED BUTTEB. 

Thicken half a pint of new milk with rather less flour than 
is directed for the comnion melted butter, or with a little arrow- 
root, and stir into it by degrees after it has boiled, a couple of 
ounces of fresh butter cut small ; do not cease to stir the sauce 
imtil this is entirely dissolved, or it may become oiled, and float 



100 « MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IT. 

Upon the top. Thin cream, substituted for the milk, and fla- 
voured with a few strips of lemon-rind cut extremely thin, some 
salt, and a small quantity of pounded mace, if mixed with rather 
less flour, and the same proportion of butter, will make an ex- 
cellent sauce to serve witn fowls or other dishes, when no gravy 
is at hand to make white sauce in the usual way. 

BUBNT BUTTEB. 

Melt in a frying-pan three ounces of fresh butter, and keep it 
stirred slowly over a gentle fire until it is of a dark brown 
colour ; then pour to it a couple of tablespoonsful of good hot 
vinegar, and season it with black pepper, and a little salt. In 
France, this is a favourite sauce witn boiled skate, which is 
served with plenty of crisped parsley, in addition, strewed 
over it. 

Butter, 3 ozs. ; vinegar, 2 tablespoonsful ; pepper ; salt. 

CLABiriEn BUTTER. 

Put the butter into a very dean and well-tinned saucepan or 
enamelled stewpan, and melt it gently over a clear fire ; when 
it just begins to simmer, skim it thoroughly, draw it from the 
fire, and let it stand a few minutes that the butter-milk may 
sink to the bottom ; then pour it dear of the sediment through 
a muslin strainer or a fine nair-sieve ; put it into jars, and store 
them in a cool place. Butter, thus prepared, will answer for all 
the ordinary purposes of cookery, and remain good for a great 
length of time. In France, large quantities are melted down in 
autumn for winter-use. The clarified butter ordered for the 
various receipts in this volume, is merely dissolved with a 
gentle degree of heat in a small saucepan, skimmed, and poured 
out for use, leaving the thick sediment behind.' 

VEBT GOOD EOO SAUCE. 

Boil four fresh eggs for quite fifteen minutes, then lav them 
into plenty of fresh water, and let them remain imtil they are 
perfectly cold. Break the shells by rolling them on a table, 
take them off, separate the whites from the yolks, and divide all 
of the latter into quarter-inch dice ; mince two of the whites 
only, tolerably small, mix them lightly, and stir them into the 
third of a pint of rich melted butter, or of white sauce : serve 
the whole as hot as possible.

is generally added to it when it is ready to serve : it should be 
stinred very hriskly in. 

DUTCH SAUCE. 

Put into a small saucepan the yolks of three fresh eggs, the 
juice of a large lemon, three oimces of hutter, a little salt and 
nutmeg, and a wineglassful of water. Hold the saucepan over 
a dear fire, and keep the sauce stirred until it nearly boils : a 
little cayenne may be added. The safest way of making all 
sauces thajt will curdle by being allowed to boil, is to put them 
into a jar, and to set the jar over the fire, in a saucepan of boil- 
ing water, and then to stir the ingredients constantly until the 
sauce is thickened sufficiently to serve. 

Yolks of eggs, 3 ; juice, 1 lemon ; butter, 3 ozs. ; little salt 
and nutmeg ; water, 1 wineglassfiil ; cayenne at pleasure. 

Obs» — A small cupful of veal gravy, mixed with plenty of 
blanched and chopped parsley, may be used instead of water for 
this sauce, when it is to be served with boiled veal, or with calf s 
head. 

naCASSEE SAUCE. 

Stir briskly, but by degrees, to the well-beaten yolks of two 
large, or of three small fresh eggs, half a pint of common 
English white sauce ; put it again into the saucepan, give it a 
shaJce over the fire, but be extremely carefiil not to allow it to 
boil, and just before it is served stir in a dessertspoonful of 
strained lemon-juice. When meat or chickens are fricasseed, 
thev should be lifted from the saucepan with a slice, drained on 
it from the sauce, and laid into a very hot dish before the eggs 
are added, and when these are just set, the sauce should be 
poured on them. 

BREAD SAUCE. 

Four quite boiling on half a pint of the finest bread-crumbs, 
an equal measure of new milk ; cover them closely with a plate, 
and let the sauce remain for twenty or thirty minutes ; put it 
then into a delicfCtely clean saucepan, with a small saltspoonM 
of salt, half as much pounded mace, a little cayenne, and about 
an oimce of fresh butter ; keep it stirred constantly over a dear 
fire for a few minutes, then mix with it a couple of spoonsfiil of 
good cream, give it a boil, and serve it immediately. When 
cream is not to be had, an additional spoonfrd or two of milk 
must be used ; and as the sauce ought to be perfectly smooth, it 
is better to shake the crumbs through a cullender before the 



ciaf.it.] sArcES. 103 

inilk is poured to them ; they should be of stale bread, and very 
lightly crated. As some will absorb more liquid than others, 
the COOK must increase a little the above proportion, should it 
be needed. Equal parts of milk and of thin cream make an 
excellent bread sance : more butter can be used to enrich it when 
it is liked. 

Bread-crumbs and new milk, each I pint (or any other 
measure); soaked 20 to 30 minutes, or more. Salt, small 
saltspoonfiil ; mace, half as much ; little cayenne; butter, 1 oz.: 
boild 4 to 5 minutes. 2 to 4 spoons^l of good cream (or 
milk) : 1 minute. Or : bread-crumbs, \ pint ; milk and cream, 
each I pint ; and from 2 to 4 spoonsful of either in addition. 

06«.— Very jxale, strong vew gravy is sometimes poured on 
the bread-crumbs, instead of milk ; and these, after being soaked, 
^ boiled extremely dry, and then brought to the proper con- 
sistency with rich cream. The gravy may be highly flavoured 
with mushrooms when this is done. 

BREAB SAUCE WITH ONION. 

Pat into a very clean saucepan nearly half a pint of fine 
bread-crumbs, and the white part of a larse mild omon, cut into 
qi]arters ; pour to these three quarters of a pint of new milk, 
and boil them very gently, keeping them often stirred, until the 
onion is perfectly tender, which wSl be in firom forty minutes to 
an hour. Press the whole through a hair-sieve, which should 
^ as clean as possible ; reduce the sauce by quick boiling, 
should it be too thin; add a seasoning of salt and grated 
ontmeg, an ounce of butter, and four spoonsful of cream, and 
when it is of the proper thickness, dish, and send it quickly to 
table. 

Bread-crumbs, nearly J pint; white part of 1 large mild 
onion ; new milk, f pint : 40 to 60 minutes. Seasoning of salt 
^d grated nutmeg ; butter, 1 oz. ; cream, 4 tablespoonsftil : to 
be boiled till of a proper consistency. 

06*.— This is an excellent sauce for those who like a subdued 
flavour of onion in it ; but as many persons object to any, the 
cook should ascertain whether it be liked before she follows this 
wcei^t. 

COMMON LOBSTEB SAUCE. 

Add to half a pint of good melted butter, a tablespoonful of 
essence of anchovies, a small half-saltspoonful of freshly 
pounded mace, and less than a quarter one of cayenne. If a 
couple of spoonsM of cream are at hand, stir them to the sauc^

when it boOs ; then pat in the flesh of the tail and daws of a 
small lobster cut into dice (or any other form) of equal size. 
Keep the saucepan by the side of the fire until the fish is quite 
heated througn, but do not let the sauce boil again : serve it 
very hot A small quantity can be made on occasion with the ' 
remains of a lobster which nas been served at table. 

Melted butter, ^ pint ; essence of anchovies, 1 tablespoonful ; 
pounded mace, small i saltspoonful ; less than i one of cayenne; 
cream (if added), 2 tablespoonsfiil ; flesh of small lobster. 

GOOD I.OB8TEB SAUCE. 

Select for this a perfectly fresh hen lobster; split the tall 
carefiiUy, and take out the inside coral ; pound half of it in a 
mortar veir smoothly with less than an ounce of butter, rub it 
through a hair-sieve, and put it aside. Cut the firm flesh of the 
fish into dice of not less than half an inch in size ; and when 
these are ready, make as much ^ood melted butter as will 
supply the quantity of sauce reqmred for table, and if to be 
served with a turfoot, or other large fish, to a numerous com- 
pany, let it be ^lentifiilly provid^. Season it slightly with 
essence of anchovies, and well with cayenne, mace, and salt ; add 
to it a few spoonsful of rich cream, and then mix a small portion 
of it very gradually with the pounded coral; when this is 
sufficiently liquefied, pour it into the sauce, and sdr the whole | 
well together ; put in umnediately the flesh of the fish, and heat 
the sauce thoroughly by the side of the fire, without allowing it 
to boil, for if it should do so its fine colour would be destroyed. 
The whole of the coral may be used for the sauce when no 
portion of it is required for other purposes.

SHSIMP SAUCB. 

The fish for this sauce should be very fresh. Shell quickly 
one pint of shrimps, and mix them with half a pint of melted but- 
ter, to which a few drops of essence of anchovies, and a little 
mace and cayenne, have been added. As soon as the shrimps 
are heated through, dish, and serve the sauce, which ought not 
to boil after they are put in. Many persons add a few spoonsM 
of rich cream to all shell-fish sauces. 

Shrimps, 1 pint ; melted butter, | pint ; essence of anchovies, 
1 teaspoonfiil ; mace, i teaspoonftil ; cayenne, very little.

To half a pint of good melted butter add three dessertspoonsful

three fine mellow anchovies very smooth, mix it with the boilm^

Knead very smoothly together with a strong bladed knife, a 
large teaspoonfal of flour* with three ounces of good butter ; stir 
them in a very clean saucepan or stewpan, over a gentle fire until 
the butter is dissolved, then throw in a little salt, and some 
cayenne, give the whole one minute's simmer, and add, very 
giudually, half a pint of good cream; keep the sauce constantly 
stirred until it boils, then mix with it a dessertspoonM of 
essence of anchovies, and half as much Chili vinegar or lemon- 
juice. The addition of shelled shrimps, or lobster cut in dice, will 
convert this at once into a most excellent sauce of either. Founded 
mace may be added to it with the cayenne ; and it may be 
thinned with a few spoonsful of milk should it be too thick. 
Omit the essence of anichovies, and mix with it some parsley 
boiled very green, and minced, and it becomes a good sauce for 
boiled poultry.

For a rich sauce of this kind, mix a dessertspoonM of flour 
with four ounces of good butter, but with from two to three 
ounces only for conmion occasions ; knead them together until 
they resemble a smooth paste, then proceed exactly as for the 
sauce above, but substitute good pale veal gravy, or strong, 
pure-flavoured veal broth, or shin of beef stods: (which, if well 
made, has little colour), for the cream ; and when these have 
boiled for two or three minutes, stir in a tablespoonM of 
conmion vinegar, and one of Chili vinegar, with as much 
cayenne as wm flavour the sauce well, and salt, should it be 
needed ; throw in from two to three dessertspoonsM of finely- 
minced parsley, give the whole a boil, and it will be ready to 
serve. A tablespoonful of mushroom catsup or of Harvey's 
I sauce may be added with the vinegar when the colour of the 
I sauce is immaterial. It may be served with boiled calf *s head, 
or with boiled eels with good effect ; and, as we have directed

a hair-sieve, gather it together, and mix it very smoothly with 
from half to three quarters of a pint of sauce Ummie^ or of 
cream fish-sauce, previously well seasoned with cayenne and 
salt, and moderately with pounded mace ; bring it to the point 
of boiling only, stir in quicldy, but gradually, a tablespoonnil of 
strained lemon-juice, and serve it very hot. When neither 
cream nor gravy is* at hand, substitute rich melted butter, 
mixed Tsdth a dessertspoonM or two of essence of anchovies, and 
weU seasoned. The fine colour of the coral will be destroyed 
by boiling. This sauce, which the French call Savjce a rAurore^ 
may be served with brill, boiled soles, grey mullet, and some 
few other kinds of fish : it is quickly made when the lobst^ 
butter of Chapter XIV. is in the house.

Obs, — The proportion of spices here must, of course, depend 
on the flavouring which the gravy or sauce may already have 
received.

and, if bottled directly it is made, may be stored for several

Obs.—Tlua sauce is exceedingly good when mixed with the 
brown gravy of a hash or stew, or with that which is served 
^th game or other dishes. 

POOB MAN*S SAUCE. 

{Served toith Turkey Poults,) 

Mix with four tablespoonsful of minced eschalots, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, nearly as much pepper, two tablespoonsful of 
^ater, and three of good sharp vinegar. Boil the sauce for a 
few minutes, and serve it hot ; or send it to table cold, when it 
is liked so. Vinegar may entirely supply the place of the 
water in this case, and a spoonful or two of oil may be mixed 
^th it. A small dessertspoonful of minced parsley, tarragon, 
or chervil, is likewise sometimes mixed with the eschalots. 
Their strong flavour may be in* some measure weakened by 
steeping them for an hour or more in a pint of cold water after 
they are minced* 

SALAD DRESSING. 

For a salad of moderate size pound very smoothly the yolks 
of two hard-boiled eggs with a small teaspoonful of unmade 
oiustard, half as much sugar in fine powder, and a saltspoonful 
of salt Mix gradually with these a small cup of cream, or the 
ame quantity of very pure oil, and two tablespoonsful of vine- 
gar. More salt and acid can be added at pleasure; but the 
latter usually predominates too much in English salads. A few 
drops of Chui or of cayenne vinegar will improve this receipt. 

Hard yolks of eggs, 2 ; unmade mustard, 1 small teaspoonful ; 
^iigar, half as much ; salt^ 1 saltspoonful ; cream or oil, small 
tupfiil ; vinegar, 2 tablespoonsf dl.

tarragon- vinegar may be substituted for other, and small quan- 
tities of soy, cavice, essence of anchovies, or catsup may in turn 
be used to flavour the compound. The salad-bowl too may be 
rubbed with a cut dove of garlic, to give the whole composition 
a very slight flavour of it. The eggs should be boiled for 
fifteen minutes, and allowed to become quite cold always before 
they are pounded, or the mixture will not be smooth : if it should 
curdle, which it will sometimes do, if not carefully made, add to 
it the yolk of a very fresh unboiled egg. 

Obit. 2.^-A8 we have before had occasion to remark, garlic, 
when very sparingly and judiciously used, imparts a remarkably 
fine savour to a sauce or gravy, and neither a strong nor a 
coarse one, as it does when used in larger quantities. The 
veriest morsel (or, as the French call it, a mere soupqcn) of the 
root, is sufficient to give this agreeable piquancy, but unless the 
proportion be extremely small, the efiect will be quite different. 
The Italians dress their salads upon a round of delicately toasted 
bread, which is rubbed with garlic, saturated with oil, and 
sprinkled with cayenne, before it is laid into the bowl : they 
also eat the bread thus prepared, but with less of oil, and un- 
toasted often, before their meals, as a digestor. 

FRENCH SALAB DRESSING. 

Stir a saltspoonful of salt and half as much pepper into a 
large spoonful of oil, and when the salt is dissolved, mix with 
them four additional spoonsfiil of oil, and pour the whole over 
the salad ; let it be well turned, and then add a couple of spoons- 
ful of tarragon vinegar ; mix the whole thoroughly, and serve it 
without delay. The salad should not be dressed in this way 
until the instant before it is wanted for table : the proportions 
of salt and pepper can be increased at pleasure, and common, or 
cucumber vmegar may be substituted for the tarragon, which, 
however, is more frequently used in France than any other. 

Salt, 1 spoonftil ; pepper, \ as much ; oil, 5 salaa-spoonsM ; 
tarragon, or other vinegar, 2 spoonsful. 

OUB OWN SAUCE FOB 8AIAD OB COLD MEAT.

Pat into a large basin the yolks otily of two fine and very 
&es}i eggs, careAilly freed from the germs, with a little salt and 
cayenne; stir these well together, then add about a teaspoonM 
of the purest salad oil, and work the mixture round with a 
wooden spoon until it appears like cream. Four in by slow< 
degrees nearly half a pint of oil, continuing at each interval 
to work the sauce as at first until it resumes the smoothness of' 
a custard, and not a particle of the oil remains visible ; then add 
a couple of tablespoonsfiil of plain or of tarragon vinegar, and 
one of cold water to whiten the sauce. A bit of clear veal jelly 
the size of an egg will improve it greatly ; and a morsel of 
garlic not larger than a pea, bruised as fine as possible, will give 
it a very agreeable relish, even to persons to whom garlic gene- 
rally is distastefiil. In lieu of this, a few drops of eschalot 
^egar may be stirred in ; and the flavour may he varied with 
lemon-juice, and cucumber, or Chili vinegar at choice. The 
^er who may have a pi-ejudice against the unboiled eggs 
^iiich enter into the composition of the Mayonnaise, will find 
that the most &stidious taste would not detect their being raw, 
i^ the sance be well made ; and persons who dislike oil may^ 
Partake of it in this form, without being aware of its presence, 
provided always that it be perfectly fresh, and pure in flavour, 
for otherwise it is easily perceptible.

Obs.—WheD. a much larger proportion of vinegar is liked, a 
third yolk of egg should be used, or the sauce will Ibe too thin. 
It is sometimes coloured green with the juice of parsley, and 
other herbs. A spoonful or two of cold bechamet or oi good

the yolk of a raw egg, stirring it well round as directed for the 
Mayonnaise. A spoonM of tarragon, cucumber, or eschalot- 
yinegar, may be added with veiy good effect; and to give it 
increased reush, a teaspoonful of cavice, or a little of Harvey*s 
sauce, and a dessertspoon^ of Chili vinegar may be thrown 
into it. This last is an excellent addition to all cold sauces, or 
salad dressings : the R%jah*s sauce (see Appendix), when good, is 
of finer flavour, and more pungent.

Obs. — A dessertspoonful of eschalots very finely minced are 
sometimes pounded with the yolks of eggs for this sauce : a 
morsel of garlic, not larger than half a hazel nut, may be sub- 
stituted for them advantageously.

Proceed exactly as for the fennel, but boil the parsley four or 
five minutes less ; and be careM to press the water from it tho- 
roughly. For an improved sauce, substitute bechamel or white

The mint for this sauce should be fresh and young, for the { 
leaves when old are tough. Strip them from the stems, wash 
them with great nicety, and drain them on a sieve or dry them 
in a cloth. Chop them very fine, put them in^ a sauce-tureen, 
and to three heaped tablespoonsfiil of the mint add two of 
pounded sugar ; mix them well, and then add gradually six 
tablespoonsful of good vinegar. The sauce made thus is 
excellent, but Lisbon sugar can be used for it when preferred, 
and all the proportions can be varied to the taste. It is com- 
monly served too liquid, and not sufficiently sweetened ; and it 
will be found much more wholesome, and generally tax more 
palatable made by this receipt. 

Young mint minced, 3 heaped tablespoonsful ; pounded

CAPES SAUCE. 

Stir into the third of a pint of good melted butter from three 
to four dessertspoonsful of capers ; add a little of the vinegar, 
and dish the sauce as soon as it boils. Keep it stirred after the 
berries are added : part of them may be minced and a little 
Chili vinegar substituted for their own. Pickled nasturtiums 
make a very good sauce, and their flavour is sometimes pre- 
ferred to that of the capers. For a large joint, increase the

CAPES SAUCB FOB 7I8H. 

To nearly half a pint of yeiy rich melted butter add sx 
spoonsf al of Strang veal gravy or jelly, a tableopoonfol of essence 
of anchovies, and some Chili vin^ar or cayenne. When there 
is no gravy at hand substitnte a half winegiassful of mnshroora 
catsup, or of Harvey*s sauce; though these deepen the colour 
more than is desirable. 

COMMON CUCUMBEB SAUCB. 

l*are, slice, dust slightly with pepper, and with flour, two or 
three young cucumbers, and fiy them a fine brown, in a little 
butter, or dissolve an ounce and a half in a small stewpan, or 
iron saucepan, and shake them in it over a brisk fire from twelve 
to fifteen minutes ; pour to them, by d^rees, nearly half a pint 
of strong beef broth, or of brown gravy ; add salt, and more 
pepper if required ; stew the whole for five minutes;, and send 
the sauce very hot to table. A minced onion may be browned 
with the encumbers when it is liked, and a spoonnd of vinegar 
added to them before they are served. 

Cucumbers, 2 or 3 ; butter, 1^ oz.; broth or gravy, nearly | 
pint; salt, pepper. 

ANOTHEB COMMON SAUCB 07 CUCUMBEB8. 

Cncnmbers which have the fewest seeds are best for this sauce. 
Pare and slice a couple, or three, should they be small, and put 
them into a saucepan, in which two ounces, or rather more, of 
better have been dissolved, and are beginning to boil ; place 
tbem high over the fire, that they may stew as softly as possible 
without taking colour, for three quarters of an hour, or longer 
sbould they require it; add to them a good seasoning of wmte 
pepper, and some salt, when they are half done, and just before 
tbey are ^rved stir ^ them hau a teaspoouAil of flour, mixed 
with a morsel of butter; strew in some minced paisley, give it 
a boil, and finish with a spoouM of good vin^ar. 

VTHITE CUCUMBER SAUCE. 

Quarter some young quickly grown cucumbers, wifbout many 
iKeds in them ; empty Uiem of these, and take off the rinds. Cut 
them into inch lengths, and boil them from fifteen to eighteen 
ininutes in salt and vrater ; squeeze, and work them through a 
flieve; mix them with a few spoonsful of bechamel, or thick white 
sauce ; do not let them hoil again, but serve them very hot. A 
Bance of better flavour is made by boiling the cucumbers in veal

graTy well seasoned, and stiiring in the beaten yolks of two or 
three ^gs, and a little Chili yin^ar or lemon-juioe, at the in- 
stant of serving. Another also ofcacumbers shced, and stewed 
in butter, but without being at all browned, and then boiled in 
pale y^ gravy, which must be thickened with ridi cream, is 
excellent. A morsel of sugar improves this sauce. 
Cucumbers, 3 : 15 to 18 minutes. White sauce, i pint. 

WHITE BCnSHBOOM SAUCE. 

Cut off the stems closely from half a pint of small button 
mushrooms ; clean them with a little salt and a bit of flannel^ 
and throw them into cold water, Rightly salted, as they axe 
done; drain them well, or dry them in a soft doth, and throw 
them into half a pint of boilmg bechamel (see page 97), or of 
white sauce made with very fresh milk, or thm cream, thickened 
with a tablespoon^ of flour, and two ounces of butter. Sim- 
mer the mushrooms fh)m ten to twenty minutes, or until they 
are quite tender, and dish the sauce, which should be properly 
seasoned with salt, mace, and cayenne. 

Mushrooms, | pint ; white sauce, | pint; seasoning of salt, 
mace, and cayenne : 10 minutes. 

ANOTHSB MUSHBOOK SAUCE. 

Prepare from half to a whole pint of very small mushroom- 
buttons with great nicety, and throw them into as much sauce 
toumee; when they^ are tender add a few spoonsful of rich 
cream, give the whole a boil, and serve it. Either of these 
sauces may be sent to table with boiled poultry, breast of veal, 
or yeal-cutlets : the sauce toumee shomd be thickened rather 
more than usual when it is to be used in this receipt. 

Mushrooms and sauce toumee each, A to whole pint : stewBd 
till tender. Cream, 4 to 8 tablespoonsful. • 

BBOWN MUSHSOOM SAUCE. 

Very small flaps, peeled and freed entirely from the flir, will 
answer for this sauce. Leave them whole, or quarter them, and 
stew them tender in some rich brown gravy; give a full season- 
ing of mace and cayenne, add thickening, aiid salt if needed, and 
a tablespoonful of good mushroom catsup. 

COMMON TOMATA SAUCE. 

Tomatas are so juicy when ripe, that they require but little 
liquid to reduce them to a proper consistency for sauce; and 



I 



CHAP.nr.] 8AUCR0. 119 

they vary 90 exceedingly in size and quality that it is difficult to 

give precise directions for the exact quantity which is needed 
for them. Take off the stalks, halve the t<Mnatas, and gently 
Isqueeze out the seeds and watery pulp ; liien stew them softly 
■Uh a few spoonsful of gravy or of strong hroth until they are 
iquite melted. Press the whole through a hair-sieve, and heat 
it afresh ^ith a little additional gravy should it he too thick, 
aod some cayenne, and salt Serve it very hot. 

Fine ripe tomatas, 6 or 8 ; gravy or strong hroth, 4 tahle- 
spoonsfui : I to I hour, or longer if needed. Salt and cayenne 
sufficient to season the sauce, and two or three spoousfol more 
of gravy if required. 

06f.— For a large tureen of this sauce, increase the propor- 
tions; and should it he at first too liquid, reduce it hy quick 
U)ilii^. When neither gravy nor hroth is at hand, the tomatas 
may be stewed periiectly tender, hut very gently, in a couple of 
ouooes of butter, vdth some cayenne and salt only, or with the 
addition of a very little finely minced onion ; then rubbed 
ihroush a sieve, and heated, and served without any addition, 
or with onlpr that of a teaspoonf ul of Chili vinegar ; or, when 
the coloiur IS not a principal consideration, with a few spoonsful 
of rich cream, smoothly mixed with a little flour to prevent its 
curdling. The sauce must be stirred without ceasing should the 
^ be added, and boiled for four or five minutes. 

A FINER TOMATA SAUCE. 

Stew veiy gently a dozen fine red tomatas, prepared as for 

the preceding receipt, with two or three sliced eschalots, four or 

fire chilies, or a capsicum or two, or in lieu of either, with a 

quarter-teaspooniul of cayenne pepper, a few small dice of lean 

ham, and half a cupful of rich gravy. Stir these often, and 

when the tomatas are reduced quite to a smooth pulp, press 

them through a sieve ; put them into a clean saucepan, with a 

few spoonsfud more of rich gravy, or £^)agnole, add salt, jf 

needed, boil the sauce, stirring it well, for ten minutes, and 

Krve it very hot. When the gravy is exceedingly good, and 

highly flavoured, the ham may be omitted: a dozen small 

ninshrooms, nicely cleaned, may i^ be sliced, and stewed with* 

the tomatas, instead of the eschalots, when their flavour is pre* 

ferred, or they may be added with them. The exact pioportion 

of liquid usea is immaterial, for should the sauce be too thin, it 

may be reduced by rapid boiling, and diluted with more gravy 

if too thick. 



120 HODBRN COOKERY. [CHAP. IT, 



BOII.ED APPI^ 8ATJCB* 

Apples of a fine cooking sort require bnt a very small portion of 
liquid to boil down well and smoothly for sauce, if plaod over a ' 
gentle fire in a close-shutting saucepan, and simmerei as softly as 1 
. possible, imtil they are well broken , and their fiavour is injured! 
, by the common mode of adding so much to them, that the . 
greater part must be drained off again before they are sent to 
table, tare the fruit quickly, quarter it, and be careful entirely 
to remove the cores; put one tablespoonful of water into a 
saucepan before the apples are thrown in ; and proceed, as we 
have directed, to simmer them until they are nearly ready to 
serve : finish the sauce by the receipt which foUows. 

Apples, ^ lb. ; water, 1 tablespoonfiil ; stewed very softly : 30 
to 60 minutes. 

Obs. — These proportions are sufiicient only for a small tureen 
of the sauce, and should be doubled for a large one. 

BAKED APPLE SAUCE. 

(^Good,) 

Put a tablespoonful of water into a quar( basm, and fill it with 
good boiling apples, pared, quartered, and care/idly cored : put 
a plate over, and set them into a moderate oven for about an 
hour, or until they are reduced quite to a pulp ; beat them smooth 
with a clean wooden spoon, adding to them a little' sugar, and a 
morsel of fresh butter, when these are liked, though: they will 
scarcely be required. 

The sauce made thus is far superior to that which is boiled. 
When no other oven is at hand, a Dutch or an American one 
would probably answer for it ; but we cannot assert this on our 
own experience. 

Grood boiling apples, 1 quart : baked, 1 hour (more or less 
according to the quality of the fruit, and temperature of the 
oven) ; sugar, 1 oz. ; butter, ^ oz. 

BBOWIT APPLE SAUCE. 

Stew gently down to a thick and perfectly smooth marmalade, 
a pound of pearmains, or of any other well-flavoured boiling 
apples, in about the third of a pint of rich brown gravy : seasra 
the sauce rather highly with black pepper or cayenne, and serve 
it veiy hot. ' Currie sauce will make an excellent substitute for 
the gravy when a very piquante accompaniment is wanted for 
. pork or other rich meats. 



CHAP.lV.] SAUCES. 121 

Apples pared and cored, 1 lb. ; good brown gravy, third of 
pint: I to IJ hour. Pepper or cayenne as needed. 

WHITB ONION SAUCE. 

Strip the skin firom some large white onions, and after having 
taken off the tops and roots, cut them in two, throw them into 
cold water as they are done, cover them plentiftilly with more, 
and boil them very tender ; lift them out, drain, and then press 
tbe water thoroughly from them ; chop them small, rub tnem 
tiirough a sieve or strainer, put them into a little rich melted 
batter, mixed with a spoonful or two of cream or milk, add a 
seasoning of salt, give the sauce a boil, and serve it very hot. 
Portugal onions, when they can be olitained, are superior to any 
others, both for this and for most other purposes of cookery. 

For the finest kind of onion sauce, see SotUtise^ below. 

BROWN ONION SAUCE. 

Cut off both ends of the onions, and slice them into a sauce- 
pan in which two ounces of butter have been dissolved ; keep 
them stewing over a clear fire until they are lightly coloured ; 
then pour to them half a pint of brown gravy, and when they 
hare boiled until they are perfectly tender, work the sauce alto- 
gether through a strainer, season it with a little cayenne, and 
serve it very not. 

ANOTHEB BBOWN ONION SAUCE. 

Mince the onions, stew them in butter until well coloured, 
^ in a dessertspoonftil of fiour, shake the stewpan over the 
fire for three or four minutes, pour in only as much broth 
or gravy as will leave the sauce tolerably thick, season, and 
serve it. 

80UBI8E. 

(^English Receipt) 

Skin, slice, and nunce quickly, two pounds* weight of the 
^hite part only of some fine mild onions, and stew them in from 
two to three ounces of good butter, over a very gentle fire, imtil 
they are reduced to a pulp, then pour to them tnree quarters of 
a pint of rich veal gravy ; add a seasoning of salt and cayenne, if 
needed ; skim off the fiit entirely, press the sauce through a 
sieve, heat it in a dean stewpan, mix it with a quarter-pint of 
rich boiling cream, and setve it directly. 

Onions, 2 lbs. ; butter, 2 to 3 ozs. : 30 nunutes to 1 hour.

(French Receipt.) 

Feel some fine white omons, and trim away all tough and 
discoloured jPftits; mince them small, and throw them into 
plenty of boUinff water ; when they have boiled quickly for five 
minutes, drain them well in a sieve, then stew them very aofUy 
indeed in an ounce or two of fresh butter, until they are diy and 
perfectly tender ; stir to them as much bechamel as will bring 
them to the coneostency of yery thick peas soup, pass the whole 
through a strainer, pressing the onion strongly that none may 
remain behind, and heat the sauce afresh, without allowing it to 
boil. A small half-teaspoonfiil of pounded sugar is sometimes 
added to this soubise. 

White part of onions, 2 lbs. : blanched 5 minutes. Butter, 
2 ozs. : 30 to 50 minutes. Bechamel, | to 1 pint, or more. 

Obs, — ^These sauces are served more particularly with lamb 
or mutton cutlets, than with any othef meats ; but they would 
probably find many approvers if sent to table with roast 
mutton, or boiled veal. Half the quantity given above will be 
sufficient for a moderate-sized dish. 

MILD BA60UT OF GARLIC, OB, L^AIL X LA BOBDBI^AISE. 

Divide some fine cloves of garlic, strip ofi^ the skin, and when 
all are ready, throw them into plenty of boiling water, slightly 
salted ; in five minutes drain this m>m them, and pour in as 
much more, which should also be quite boiling; continue to 
change it every five or six minutes until the earlic is quite 
tender ; throw m a moderate proportion of salt the last time to 
give it the proper flavour. Drain it thoroughly, and serve it in 
the dish with roast mutton, or put it into good brown gravy, or 
white sauce for table. By changing very frequently uie water 
in which it is boiled, the root wul be deprived of its naturally 
pungent flavour and smell, and rendered extremely mild ; when 
it is not wished to be quite so much so, change the water every 
ten minutes only. 

Garlic, 1 pint: 15 to 25 minutes or more. Water to be 
changed every 5 or 6 minutes ; or every 10 minutes when not 
wish^ so very mild. Gravy or sauce, 1 pint 

BOLD ESCHALOT SAUCE. 

Prepare and boil fix>m half to a whole pint of eschalots by 
the preceding receipt ; unless very large, they will be tender in 
about fifteen minutes, sometimes m less, in which case the water 



CHAP. IT.] 8AUCBB. 123 

mnst be poured from them shoiiiy after it has been ehaneed for 
the second time. When grown in a suitable floil, and comvated 
mth care, the eschalots are sometimes treble the siae that the3r 
are under other circomstanoes ; and this difierenoe must be 
allowed for in boiling them. Drain them ioe&, and mix them 
with white sauce or gravy, or with good melted butter, and 
serve them very hot. 

A FINS 8AUCB, OX PUB^B OF VBGETABLB XAUtOW. 

Pare one or two half grown marrows and cut out aU the seeds; 
take a pomid of the vegetable, and slice it with one ounce of 
mild onion, into a pint of strong veal broth or of pale gravy { 
stew them very sonly for nearly or quite an hour ; add salt 
and cayenne, or white pepper, wnen they are nearly done; press 
the whole through a fine and delicately clean hair-sieve ; heat it 
a&esh, and stir to it when it bofls aboot the third of a pint of 
rich cream. Serve it with boiled chickens, stewed or boiled 
real, lamb cutlets, or any other delicate meat When to be 
served as a puree, an aaditional half pound of the vegetable 
must be used ; and it should be dished with small fried sippets

1 large teaspoonful (twice as much if all milk be used) ; salt, i 
teaspoonM or more ; cream, or cream and milk mixed, from i 
to 1 pint. 

OLIVE-SAUCE. 

Remove the stones from some fine French or Italian olives 
by paring the fruit close to them, round and round in the form 
of a corkscrew : they will then resume their original shape when 
done. Weigh six ounces thus prepared, throw them into boil- 
ing water, let them blanch for five minutes, drain, and throw 
them into cold water, and leave them in it from half an hour to 
an hour, proportioning the time to their saltness ; drain them 
well, and stew them gently from fifteen to twenty-five minutes 
in a pint of very rich brown gravy, or Espagnole (see Chapter 
m.) : add the juice of half a lemon, and serve the sauce very 
hot. Half this quantity will be sufficient for a small party. 

Olives, stoned, 6 ozs. ; rich gravy, 1 pint : 15 to 25 minutes. 
Juice, \ lemon. 

Ohs* — In France this sauce is served very commonly with 
ducks, and sometimes with beef-steaks, and stewed fowl. 

CELEBT SAUCE. 

Slice the white part of from three to five heads of young 
tender celery ; peel it if not very young, and boil it in salt and 
water for twenty minutes. K for white sauce, put the celery, 
after it has been well drained, into half a pint of veal broth or 
gravy, and let it stew until it is quite son ; then add an ounce 
and a half of butter, mixed with a dessertspoonftd-of fiour, and 
a quarter-pint of thick cream, or the yolks of three eggs. The 
French, after boiling the celery, which they cut very small, for 
about twenty minutes, drain, and chop it ; then put it with a 
^lice of butter into a stewpan, and season it with pepper, salt, 
and nutmeg ; th^ keep these stirred over the fire for two or 
three minutes, and then dredge in a dessertspoonful of flour; 
when this has lost its raw taste, they pour m a sufficiency of 
White gravy to moisten the celery, and to allow for twenty 
minutes* longer boiling. A very good common celery sauce is 
made by simply stewing the celery, cut into inch-lengths, in 
butter, until it begins to be tender ; and then adding a spoonfiil 
of flour, which must be allowed to brown a little, and half a 



CHAP. IV.] SAUCES. 125 

pint of good broth or beef gravy, with a seasoning of pepper or 
cayenne. 

Celeiy, 3 to 5 heads: 20 minutes. Veal broth, or gravy, { 
pint: 20 to 40 minutes. Butter, l^oz.; flour, 1 dessertspoon- 
^ \ cream, | pint, or three yolks of eggs. 

WHITE CHESTNUT SAUCE. 

Strip the outer rind from six ounces of sound, sweet chestnuts, 
then throw them into boilins water, and let them simmer for 
two or three minutes, when uie second skin will easily peel off. 
Add to them three quarters of a pint of good cold veal gravy, 
^d a few strips of lemon peel, and let them stew gently Ibr an 
boor and a quarter. Press them, with the gravy, tmrough a 
hair-sieve reversed, and placed over a deep disn or pan, as they 
&re much more easily rubbed through thus than in the usual 
way: a wooden spoon should be used in preference to any 
<>tlier for the process. Add a little cayenne and mace, some 
salt if needed, and about six tablespoonsfiil of rich cream. 
Keep the sauce stirred imtil it boils, and serve it immediately. 

Chestnuts without their rinds, 6 ozs. ; veal gravy, f pint; 
^d of \ lemon : li hour. Salt; spice ; cream, 6 tablespoons- 
ful. 

06*.~This sauce may be served with turkey, with fowls, or 
ifith veal-cutlets stewed. 

BBOWIf CHESTNUT SAUCE. 

Substitute rich brown gravy for the veal stock, omit the 
lemon-rind and cream, heighten the seasonings, and mix the 
chestnuts with a few spoonsful of Espagnole or highly flavoured 
gravy after they have been passed tlurough the sieve. 

SWEET PUDDING SAUCE. 

Bofl together for fifteen minutes the thin rind of half a small 
lemon, an ounce and a half of fine sugar, and a wineglassful of 
water; then take out the lemon-peel, and mix very smoothly 
an ounce of butter with rather more than a half-teaspoonful of 
flour, stir them round in the sauce imtil it has boiled one 
minute ; next add a wineglassM and a half of sherry or 
^ladeira, or two thirds of that quantity and a quarter-gla^ of 
brandy : when quite hot, serve the sauce. 

Port- wine sauce is made in the same Way, with the addition 
of a dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, some grated nutmeg, and a 
little more sugar : orange rind and juice may be used to give it 
flavour when preferred to lemon. 



126 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAF. tV.

PUNCH SAUCE FOR 8WEBT PUDDINGS. 

This is a favourite sauce with custard, plain bread, and plnm- 
puddinffs. With two ounces of sugar and a ouarter-pmt of 
water, boil veiy gently the rind of half a small lemon, and 
somewhat less of orange-peel, from fifteen to twenty minutes ; 
strain out the rinds, thicken the sauce with an ounce and a half 
of butter and nearly a teaspoon^ of flour, add a half-glass of 
brandy, the same of white wine, two thirds of a glass of rum, 
with the juice of half an orange, and rather less of lemon- 
juice : serve the sauce very hot, but do not allow it to boil after 
the spirit is stirred in. 

Sugar, 2 ozs. ; water, i pint ; lemon and orange rind : 14 to 
20 minutes. Butter, 1} oz. ; flour, I teaspoonful ; brandy and

COBfMON PUDDING SAUCE. 

Sweeten a quarter-pint of good melted butter with an ounce 
and a half of sugar, and add to it gradually a couple of glasses 
of wine ; stir it until it is at the point of boiling, and serve it 
immediately. Lemon-grate, or nutmeg, can be added at 
pleasure. 

A DELICIOUS GERMAN PUDDING SAUCE. 

Dissolve in half a pint of sherry or of Madeira, from three to 
four ounces of fine sugar, but do not allow the wine to boil ; stir 
it hot to the well-beaten yolks of six fresh eggs, and mill the 
sauce over a gentle fire imtil it is well thickened, and highly 
frothed ; pour it over a plum, or any other kind of sweet boiled 
pudding, of which it much improves the appearance. Half the 
quantity will be sufficient for one of moderate size. A small 
machine, resembling a chocolate mill, is us^ in Germany for 
frothing this sauce ; but a couple of silver forks, fastened to- 
gether at the handles, will serve for the purpose, on an emer- 
gency. We recommend the addition or a dessertspoonfiil of 
strained lemon-juice to the wine^ 

For large pudding, sherry or Madeira, ^ pint ; fine sugar, 3 
to 4 pzs. ; yolks of eggs, 6 ; lemon-juice (if added), 1 dessert-

Gather a quantity of young parsley, strip it from the stalka, 
wash it very dean, shake it as dry as possible in a doth, pound 
it in a mortar, press all the juice dosely firom it through a hair- 
sieye rerersed, and put it into a elean jar ; let it into a pan of 
boiling water, and in about three minutes, if genihf aimmered, 
the juice will be poached suffidently ; lay it then upon a clean 
sieve to drain, and it will be ready for use. 

TO CSISP PABSI.ST. 

Pick some branches of young parsley, wash them well, drain 
them&om the water, and swing them in a dean cloth until they 
are quite dry ; place them on a sheet of writing paper in a 
Datch oven, before a brisk fire, and keep them frequently turned 
until they are quite crisp. They will be done in from six to 
minutes. 



FBIEB PABSLET. 

When the parsley has been prepared as for crisping, and is 
yttite dry, throw it into plenty of lard or butter, which is on the 
point of boiling ; take it up with a skimmer the instant it is 
crisp, and drain it on a doth spread upon a sieve reversed, and 
placed before the fire. 

ANCHOVT BUTTER. 

Scrape the skin quite dean from a dozen fine mellow ancho- 
^ free the flesh entirdy from the bones, and pound it as 
smooth as possible in a mortar ; rub it through the back of a 
^-aieve with a wooden spoon ; wipe out the mortar, and put 
Wk the anchovies with three quartan of a pound of very fi^h 
Initter, a small half-saltspoonfiil of cayenne, and more than twice 
as much of finely grated nutmeg, and freshly pounded mace ; 
and beat them together until they are thoroughly blended. If 
to serve cold at table, mould the butter in small shapes, and 
turn it out. A little rose pink (which is sold at the chemists*) is 
sometimes used to give it a fine colour, but it must be sparingly 
used, or it will impart an unpleasant flavour : it should be well 
pounded, and very equally mixed with it. For kitchen use, 



128 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. IV, 

press tne butter down into jars or pattypans, and keep il in a 
cool place. 

Fine anchovies, 12 ; butter, } lb. ; cayenne, small ) saltspoon- 
ful ; nutmeg and mace, each more than twice as much ; rose- 
pink (if used), i teaspoonful. 

Obs. — This proportion differs from potted anchovies, only 
in the larger proportion of butter mixed with the fish, and the 
milder seasoning of spice. It will assist to form an elegant dish 
if made into pati, and stamped with a tasteful impression, then 
placed alternately with pats of lobster-butter, and decorated 
with light foliage. It is generally eaten with much relish when 
carefully compounded, and makes excellent sandwiches. To 
convert it into a good fish sauce, mix two or three ounces of it 
with a teaspoonful of fiour and a few spoonsful of cold water, 
or of pale veal stock, and keep them constantly stirred until 
they boil. The butter should not be moulded directly it is 
taken from the mortar, as it is then very soft from the beating. 
It should be placed until it is firm in a very cool place, or over 
ice, when it can be done conveniently. 

TARTAR MUSTARD. 

Rub four ounces of the best Durham mustard very smooth 
with a full teaspoonful of salt, and wet it by degrees with strong 
horseradish vinegar, a dessertspoonful of cayenne, or of Chili 
vinegar, and one or two of tarragon vinegar, when its flavour is 
not disliked. A quarter-pint of vinegar poured boiling upon 
an ounce of scraped horseradish, and left for one night, closely 
covered, will be ready to use for this mustard, but it will be 
better for standing two or three days. 

Durham mustard, 4 ozs.; salt, large teaspoonfiil ; cayenne, or 
Chili vinegar, 1 dessertspoonfiil ; horsera^sh vinegar, third of 
pint. 

Obs. — This is an exceedingly pungent compound, but has 
many admirers. 

ANOTHER TARTAR MUSTARD. 

Mix the salt and mustard smoothly, with equal parts of horse- 
radish vinegar, and of Chili vinegar. Mustard made by there 
receipts will keep long, if put into jars or bottles, and closely 
. stopped. Cucumber, eschalot, or any other of the flavoured 
vinegars for which we have given receipts, may in turn be used 
for it, and mushroom, gherkin, or India pickle-liquor, like- 
wise.

MILD MUSTARD. 

Mustard for instant nse should be mixed with milk, to which 
aspoonM or two of very thin cream may be added. 

MUSTARD THB COMMON WAT. 

The great art of mbring mustard, is to have it perfertly 
smooth, and of a proper consistency. The liquid with which it 
is moistened shoiUd be added to it in small quantities, and the 
mustard should be well rubbed, and beaten with a spoon. Mix 
a half-teaspoonful of salt with two ounces of the flour of mus- 
tard, and stir to them by degrees, sufEicient boiling water to 
reduce it to the appearance of a thick batter; do not put it into 
the mustard-glass until cold. Some persons like a half-tea- 
spoonM of sugar, in the finest powder, mixed with it. It 
ought to be sufficiently diluted always to drop easily from the 
spoon. 

FRENCH BATTER. 

[For frying vegetables, and for apple, peachy or orange fritters,} 

Cut a couple of ounces of good butter into small bits, pour on 
it less than a quarter-pint of boiling water, and when it is dis- 
solved, add three quarters of a pint of cold water, so that the 
whole shall not be quite milk warm ; mix it then by degrees, 
and very smoothly, with twelve ounces of fine diy flour, and a 
mall pmch of salt, if the batter be for fruit fritters, but with 
more if for meat or vegetables. Just before it is used, stir into 
it the whites of two eggs beaten to a solid froth ; but previously 
to this, add a little water should it appear too thick, as some 
flour requires more liquid than other, to bring it to the proper 
consistency. 

Butter, 2 ozs.; water, from } to nearly 1 pint; little salt; 
flour, I lb. ; whites of 2 ^gs, beaten to snow. 

TO PREPARE BREAD FOR FRTINQ FISH< 

Cut thick slices from the middle of a loaf of li^ht bread, pare 
the crust entirely from them, and dry them gradually in a cool 
oven until they are crisp quite through ; let them become cold, 
then roll or beat them into fine crumbs, and keep them in a dry 
place for use. To strew over hams or cheeks of bacon, the 
bread should be left all night in the oven, which should be si^- 
dently heated to brown, as well as to harden it : it ought indeed 
to be entirely converted into equally-coloured crust. It may be 
sifted through a dredging-box on to the huns, after it has been 
reduced almost to powder.

BROWNED FLOUB FOB THICKENINO SOUPS AlVD GRAYIBS. 

Spread it on a tin or dish, and colour it, without burning, in 
a gentle oven, or before the fire in a Dutch or American oven : 
turn it often, or the e^es will be too much browned before the 
middle is enough so. This, blended with butter, makes a con- 
venient thickening for soups or gravies, of which it is desirable 
to deepen the colour ; and it requires less time and attention 
than the French roux of page 96. 

PBIED BBEAD-CBUMBS. 

Grate lightly into very fine crumbs four ounces of stale bread, 
and shake them through a cullender, without rubbing or touch- 
ing them with the hands. Dissolve two ounces of n^esh butter 
in a frying-pan, throw in the crumbs, and stir them constantly 
. over a moderate fire, until they are all of a clear gold colour; 
lift them out with a skimmer, spreeul them on a son cloth laid 
upon a sieve reversed, and dry them before the fire. They may 
be more delicately prepared by browning them in a gentle oven 
without the addition of butter. 

Bread, 4 ozs. ; butter, 2 ozs. 

FRIED BREAD FOR OARinSHDIG. 

Cut the crumb of a stale loaf in slices a quarter-inch thick: 
form them into diamonds, or half diamonds, or shape them 
with a paste-cutter in any other way ; firy them in firesh butter, 
some of a very pale brown, and others a deeper colour : diy 
them well, and plaoe them alternately round the dish that is to 
be garnished. They may be made to adhere to the edge of the 
dish, when they are required for ornament only, by means of a 
little flour and white of esg brushed over the side which is 
placed on it ; this must be aUowed to dry before they are served. 

THE RAJAH^S SAUCE. 

Strain, very clear, the juice of six fine lemons ; add to it a 
STnall teaspoonM of salt, a drachm of good cayenne-peppert 
and a slight strip or two of the lemon-rind cut extremely tnin. 
Give the sauce three or four minutes simmering ; turn it into 
a China jug or basin ; and when it is quite cold, strain it again, 
put it into small dry bottles, cork them well, and store them in 
a cool place which is free from damp. The sauce is good with- 
out bem^ boiled, but is apt to ferment after a time : it is, we 
think, of much finer flavour than Chili vinegar. 

Lemon-juice i pint; salt 1 small teaspoonM; cayenne 1

Stone four otmcce of good rturaDB, and chop

, fruit- Take four ounces of coarse brown sugar, 
'" o of powdered ginger, and the same gnantity of 
t and cayenne peppery grind these ingredients 
separately in a mortar, aa fine as possible ; then 
pound the fruits well, and mix the spices «ith 
them, one hy one ; beat them t(^;ether until they 
are perfectly blended, and add gradually as much 
vinegar as 'will make the sauce of the consistency 
of thick cream. Put it into a bottle with an ounce 
of garlic, divided into cloves, and cork it tightly. 

Stoned raisms, 4 ozs. ; crabs, or other acid Ihiit, 
) lb. ; coarse sugar, 4 otb. ; powdered ginger, 
2 ozs. ; salt, 2 ora. ; cayenne- pep^r, 2 ozs, ; garlic, 
QmUb. 1 oz. ; vinegar, enough to dilute it properly. 
Obs. — This favourite oriental sauce is compounded in a great 
variety of ways ; but some kind of acid fruit is essential to it. 
The mango b used in India; here the bullacea in an unripe 
' state answer very well. Gooseberries also, while still hard and 
green, are sometimes used for it ; and ripe red chilies and 
tomatas are mixed with the other ingredients. The sauce keeps 
better if it be exposed to a centle degree of heat for a week or 
two, either by the side of the flrc, or in a full southern aspect 
in the eun. In this case it must be put into a jar or bottle^ | 
and well secured &om the air. Half a pound of gooseberries i 
or of these and tamarinds from the shell, and green appks 
mixed, and the same weight of salt, stoned raisins, brown sugar, 
powdered gicaer, chilies, and garlic, with a pint and a half of. 
vine^, and the Juice of three large lemons, will make another' 
genume Bengal cnetney. 



Cut the ends of the stalks from two gaUons of freshly-gathered 
mushroms (the large flapa are beat for this purpose, but they 
should not be worm-eaten) ; break them into a deep earthen 
pan, and strew amongst them three quarters of a pound of salt, 
reserving the larger portion of it for the top. Let them stand 
for three, or even four days, and stir them gently once every 
four and twenty hours j then drain off the liquor without

pressing the mushrooms; strain and measore it; put it into a 
very dean stewpan, and boil it quickly until reduced nearly or 
quite half. For eyery quart, allow half an ounce of whole 
black pepper, and a drachm of mace ; or, instead of the pepper, 
a qnarter-teaspoonfiil (ten grains) of good cayenne ; pour the 
catsup into a clean jug or jar, lay a folded cloth oyer it, and 
keep it in a cool place until the following day ; pour it gently 
from the sediment, put it into small bottles, cork them well, 
and rosin them down. A teaspoonful of salad-oil may be 
poured into each bottle before it is corked, the better to exclude 
the air fix>m the catsup : it must be kept in a dry cool place. 

Mushrooms, 2 gallons ; salt, f lb. ; to macerate three or four 
days. To each quart of liquor, ) oz. black pepper, or quarter- 
teaspoonM cayenne ; and 1 drachm mace : to be reduced half. 

Obs. 1. — Catsup made thus will not be too salt, nor will the 
flavour of the mushrooms be oyerpowered by that of the spices ; 
of which a larger quantity, and a greater yariety, can be used at 
will. 

Obs. 2.— After the mushrooms have stood for three or four 
days, as we have directed, the whole may be turned into a large 
stewpan, brought slowly to a boil, and simmered for a few 
nmmtes before the liquor is strained off. We think the catsup 
keeps rather better wnen this is done, but we recommend only 
just sufficient simmering to preserve it well. When the mush* 
rooms are crushed, or mashed, as some authors direct, the 
liquor will necessarily be very thick ; it is better to proceed as 
above, and then to boil the saueezings of the mushrooms with 
the sediment of the catsup, ana sufficient cloves, pepper, allspice, 
and ginger, to flavour it highly : this second catsup will be 
found very useftil to mix with common thickened sauces, hashes, 
and stews. In some seasons it is necessary to boil the catsup 
with the spice a second time after it has been kept for three or 
four months: this, by way of precaution; can always be done, 
but it had better then be put into large bottles in the first 
instance, and stored in the small ones afterwards.

Break apeck of large mushrooms into a deep earthen-pan ; strew 
three quarters of a pound of salt amongst them, and set them 
into a very cool oven for one night, with a fold of cloth or paper

On a gallon of fresh mushrooms strew three ounces of salt, 
and pour to them a quart of ready-made catsup (that which is a 
year old will do if it be perfectly good) ; keep these stirred 
occasionally for four days, then drain the liquor very dry from 
the mushrooms, and boil it for fifteen minutes, with an ounce of

Take a pint and a half of mushroom catsup when it is first 
made, and ready boiled (the double is best for the purpose), 
simmer in it for five minutes, an ounce of small eschalots nicely 
peeled ; add to these half a pint of walnut catsup, and a wine- 
glassful of cayenne vinegar,* or of Chili vinegar; give the 
whole one boil, pour it out, and when cold, bottle it with the

WALNUT CATSUP. 

The vinegar in which walnuts have been pickled, when they 
have remained in it a year, will generally answer all the 
purposes for which this catsup is required, particularly if it be 
dramed from them and boiled for a few mmutes, with a little 
additional spice, and a few eschalots ; but where the vin^ar is 
objected to, it may be made either by boiling the expressed juice 
of yoimg walnuts for an hour, with six ounces of fine anchovies, 
four ounces of eschalots, half an ounce of black pepper, a quarter- 
ounce of cloves, and a drachm of mace, to every quart ; or as 
follows : —

amongst them as they are done half a pound of salt; then 
pour to them a quart of strong vinegar, and let them stand until 
they have become quite hlack, keeping them stirred three or 
four times a day ; next add a quart of strong old beer, and boil 
the whole together for ten minutes ; strain it^ and let it remain 
until the next day ; then pour it off dear from the sediment, 
add to it half a poimd of anchovies, one large head of earlic

doves and black pepper, and two drachms of mace : boil these 
together for half an hour, and the following day bottle and cork 
the catsup well. It will keep for a dozen years. Many persons 
add to it, before it is boiled, a bottle of port wine ; and others 
recommend a large bunch of sweet herbs to be put in with the 
spice.

Either divide six small lemons into quarters, remove all the 
pips that are in sight, and strew three ounces of salt upon them, 
and keep them turned in it for a week, or, merely make deep 
mdaions in them, and proceed as directed for pickled lemons.

When they have stood in a warm place for eight days, put into' 
a stone jar two ounces and a half of finely sdraped horseradish, 
and two ounces of esphalots, or one and a half of garlic ; to these 
add the lemons with all their liquor, and pour on them a pint 
and a half of boiling vinegar in which halfmn ounce of brmsed 
ginger, a quarter-ounce of whole white pepper, and two blades 
of mace have been simmered for two or three minutes. The 
pickle will be fit for use in two or three months, but may stand 
four or five before it is strained off.

On one pint of ripe elderberries stripped from the stalks, pour 
three quarters of a pint of boiling vinegar, and let it stand in a 
cool oven all ni^ht ; the next day strain off the liquid without 
pressure, and boil it for five minutes with a half-teaspoonful of 
salt, a small race of ginger, a blade of mace, forty corns of pepper, 
twelve cloves, and lour eschalots. Bottle it with the spice wnen 
it is quite cold. 

BOTTLEB TOMATAS, OB TOMATA CATSUP. 

Cut half a peck of ripe tomatas into quarters ; lay them on 
dishes, and sprmkle over them half a pound of salt. The next 
day drain the Juice from them through a hair-sieve into a stew- 
pan, and boil it half an hour with three dozens of small capsi- 
cums, and half a pound of eschalots; then add the tomatas, 
which should, be ready pulped through a strainer. Boil the 
whole for thirty minutes longer; have some clean bottles, kept 
warm by the fire, fill them with the catsup while it is quite hot; 
cork, an(^ rosin them down directly. 

Tomatas, ^ peck; salt, I lb.; capsicums, 3 doz.; eschalots, 
i lb. : i hour. After pulp is added, i hour. 

Obs. — This receipt nas been kindly contributed by a person 
who makes by it every year large quantities of the catsup, which 
is considered excellent : for sauce, it must be mixed with gravy 
or melted butter. We have not ourselves been able to make 
trial of it. 

EPICUBEAN SAUCE. 

Mix well, bv shaking them in a bottle a quarter-pint of 
Indian soy, half a pint of Chili vinegar, half a pint of walnut 
catsup, and a pint and a half of the best mushroom catsup. 
These proportions make an excellent sauce, either to mix with 



CHAP, v.] STORE SAUCES. 137 

melted butter, and to serre with fish, or to add to different 
kinds of gravy ; but they can be varied, or added to, at pleasure. 

Indian soy, ^ pint; Chili vinegar, ^ pint; walnut catsup, 
i pint ; mushroom catsup, 1 1 pint. 

06*.— A pint of port wine, a few eschalots, and some thin 
strips of lemon-rmd will convert this into an admirable store- 
sauce. Less soy would adapt it better to many tastes. 

TABBAGON VIMEGAB. 

Gather the tarragon just before it blossoms, which will be 
late in July, or early in August ; strip it from the larger stalks, 
and put it into small stone jars or wide-necked bottles, and in 
doing this twist some of the branches so as to bruise the leaves 
and wring them asunder ; then pour in sufficient distilled or 
very pale vinegar to cover the tarragon ; let it infuse for two 
months, or more : it will take no harm even by standing all the 
winter. When it is poiired off strain it very clear, put it into 
small dry bottles, and cork them well. Sweet basil vinegar is 
made in exactly the same way, but it should not be left on the 
leaves more than three weeks. The jars or bottles should be 
filled to the neck with the tarragon before the vinegar is added : 
its flavour is strong and peculiar, but to many tastes very 
agreeable. It* imparts quite a foreign character to the dishes 
for which it is used. 

GREEN MINT VINEGAB. 

Rck and slightly chop, or bruise, freshly-gathered mint, and 
put it into bottles ; fill them nearly to the necks, and add 
vinegar as for tarragon : in' forty days, strain it off, and bottle it 
for use. 

The mint itself, ready minced for sauce, will keep well in 
vinegar, though the colour will not be very good. * 

CTJCUMBEB VINEGAB. 

First wipe, and then, without paring, slice into a jar some 
young and quickly-grown cucumbers ; pour on them as much 
boiling vinegar as will cover them well, with a teaspoonful of 
salt, and two thirds as much of peppercorns to the pint and a 
half of vinegar : it may remain on them for a month, or even 
for two, if well defended from the air. A mild onion can be 
intermixed with the cucumbers, when its flavour is considered an 
improvement. 

CELEBY VINEGAB. 

Pat into a wide-necked bottle or pickle-jar eight ounces of 



138 MOPERN COOKERT. QcHAP. Y, 

the white part of the root and stalks of fine fresh celery cut into 
slices, and pour on it a pint of boiling vinegar; when a little 
cool, cork it down, and in three weeks it will be ready to strain, 
and to bottle for keeping. Half an ounce of bruised celery-seed 
will answer the same purpose, when the root cannot be ob- 
tained. This is an agreeable addition to a salad, when its 
flavour is much liked: a half-teaspoon^ of salt should be 
boiled in it 

BSCHALOT, OB GABUG VOIEOAB. 

On from four to six oimces of eschalots, or on two of garlic, 
peeled and bruised, pour a quart of the best vinegar ; stop the 
jar or bottle close, and in a fortnight or three weeks the vine- 
gar may be strained off for use : a few drops will give a sufS- 
cient flavour to a sauce, or to a tureen of gravy. 

Eschalots, 4 to 6 ozs. ; or, garlic, 2 to 4 ozs. ; vinegar, 1 quart : 
15 to 21 days. 

Ohs. — These roots may be used in smaller or in larger pro- 
portion, as a slighter or a stronger flavour of them is desu^d, 
and may remain longer in the vinegar without any detriment 
to it. 

ESCHAIX>T WINS. • 

This is a far more useM preparation even than the preceding 
one, since it can be used to unpart the flavour of the eschalot to 
dishes for which acid is not required. Feel and slice, or bruise, 
four ounces of eschalots, put them into a bottle, and add to them 
a pint of sherry; in a rortnight pour off the wine, and should 
it not be strongly flavoured with the eschalots, steep in it two 
ounces more, ror another fortnight ; a half-teajspoonful of ca- 
yenne may be added at first. The bottle should be shaken 
occasionally, while the eschalots are inking, but should remain 
undisturbed for the last two or three days, that the wine may 
be clear when it is poured off to bottle for keeping. Sweet- 
basil wine is made by steeping the fresh leaves of we herb in 
wine, from ten to fifteen days. 

Eschalots, 4 ozs. ; sherry 1 pint : 15 days, or more. 

HOBSEBADISH VINEOAB. 

. On four ounces of young and freshly-scraped horseradish 
pour a quart of boiling vinegar, and cover it down closely : it 
will be ready for use in three or four days, but may remam for 
weeks, or months, before the vinegar is poured off An ounce 



CHIP, v.] STORE SAVCBS. 139 

of mmoed eschalot may be sabstituted for one of the horse- 
radish, if the flavour be.liked. 

CATENHB YINEGAB« 

Put from a aoarter to half an ounce of the best cayenne pep- 
per into a bottle, and pour on it a pint of pale yinegar. Uork 
it closely, and shake it well every two or three days. It may 
remain any length of tin^e before it is poured off, but will very 
soon be r^y for use. From being so extremely pungent, it ia» 
for some purposes, preferable to Chili vinegar, as the cayenne 
seasoning can be given with less of add. It may be made of 
any d^ree of strength. We T^am the young housekeeper 
against using essence of cayenne (or cayenne steeped in brandy) 
for flavouring any dishes, as the brandy is very perceptible al- 
ways, and gives an exceedingly coarse taste. 

Good cayenne pepper, ^ to ji oz. ; vinegar, 1 pint: infuse 
from 2 weeks to 12 months. 

LEMON BBAITDT. 

{For flavouring sweet dishes.^ 

Fill any sized wide-necked bottle lightly with the very thin 
rinds of &esh lemons, and cover them with good brandy ; let 
them remain three weeks, then strain off the spirit and keep it 
veil corked for use : a few apricot*kemels blanched and infosed 
vith the lemon-rind will give an agreeable flavour. 

ANOTHEB STOBE-FLAVOUBING FOB PUDDINGS OB CAKES. 

Rasp on from two to four ounces of sugar the rinds of a couple 
of fine lemons, reduce the lumps to powder, and add it gra- 
dually to, and pound it with, an ounce of bitter almonds, 
blanched and wiped very dry. When these have been beaten 
to a fine paste, and the whole is well blended, press the mixture 
into a small pan, tie a paper over, and keep it for use. ' The 
proportions can be varied at pleasure, and the quantities in- 
creased: from a teaspoonful to three times as much can be 
mixed with the ingre^ents for a pudding. Cakes require more 
in proportion to their size. 

Kinds large lemons, 2 ; sugar, 2 to 4 ozs. ; bitter almonds, 1 oz. 

DBIED MUSHBOOMS. 

Peel small, sound, freshly-gathered flaps, cut off the stems, 
and scrape out the frir entirely ; then arrange the mushrooms 
singly on tins or dishes, and dry them as gradually as possible 
in a gentle oven. Put thexn, when they are done, mto tin 



14Q MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. V. 

canisters, and store them where they will be secure from damp. 
French cooks give them a single boil in.water, from which they 
then are well drained, and dried, as usual. When wanted for 
table, they should be put into cold gravy, slowly heated, and 
gently simmered, until they are tender. 

MUSHROOM POWDEF. 

When the nRishrooms have been prepared with great nicety^ 
and dried, as in the foregoing receipt, pound them to a very fine 
powder; sift it, and put it immediately into small and perfectly 
dry bottles ; cork and seal them without delay, for if the powder 
be long exposed to the air, so as to imbibe an^ humidity, or if it 
be not well secured from it in the bottles, it will be likely to 
become putrid : much of that which is purchased, even at the 
best Italian warehouses, is found to be so, and, as it is sold at a 
very high price, it is a great economy, as well as a surer plan, to 
have it carefully prepared at home. It is an exceedingly useful 
store, and an elegant addition to many dishes and sauces. To 
insure its bein^ good, the mushrooms should be gathered in dry 
weather, and if any addition of spices be made to the powder 
(some persons mix with it a seasoning of mace and cayenne), 
they should be put into the oven for awhile before they are 
used: but even these precautions will not be sufficient, unless 
the powder be stored in a very dry place after it is bottled. A 
teaspoonful of it, with a quarter-pint of strong veal gravy, as 
mucn cream, and a small dessertspoonful of flour, will make an 
excellent bechamel or white sauce. 

POTATO FLOUB* 

(^Fecule de Pommes de terre^ 

Grate into a large vessel full of cold water, six pounds of 
sound mealy potatoes, and stir them well together. In six 
hours pour on the water, and add fresh, stirring the mixture 
well ; repeat this process every three or four hours during the 
day, change the water at night, and the next morning pour it 
off; put two or three quarts more to the potatoes, and turn 
them directly into a hair-sieve, set over a pan to receive the 
flour, which may then be washed through the sieve, by pouring 
water to it. Let it settle in the pan, drain off the water, spread 
the potato-sediment on dishes, dry it in a slow oven, sift it, and 
put it into bottles or jars, and cork or cover them closely. The 
flour thus made will be beautifully white, and perfectly tasteless. 
It will remain good for years.

Take any quantity of whole rice, wash it thoroughly, chang- 
ing the water several times ; drain and press it in a cloth, then 
spread it on a dish, and dry it perfectly ; heat it in a mortar to a 
smooth powder, and sift it through a nne sieve. When used to 
thicken soup or sauces, mix it with a small quantity of cold 
water or of broth, and pour it to them while they are boiliuff . 

This flour, when newly made, is of much purer flavour than 
any usually prepared for sale.

AU herbs which are to be dried for storing should be gathered 
in fine weather ; cleared from dirt and decayed leaves ; and dried 
quickly, but witl^out scorching, in a Dutch oven before the fire, 
or in any other that is not too much heated. The leaves should 
then he stripped from the stalks, pounded, sifted, and closely 
corked in separate bottles ; or several kinds may be mixed and 
pounded together for the convenience of seasoning in an instant 
gravies, soups, forcemeats, and made dishes: appropriate spices, 
celery-seed, and dried lemon-peel, all in fine powder, can be 
added to the herbs. 

THE doctor's zest. 

Pound to the finest powder separately, eight ounces of basket

add the other ingredients, one by one, to the salt, and pound 
them together until they are perfectly well blended. Put the 
zest into wide-mouthed phials, and cork them tightly. Half an 
ounce of mushroom-powder, and a drachm of dned lemon-peel, 
will greatly improve this mixture.

CHAPTER VL 
FORCEMEATS. 

GEN£BAXi RBMABKS. 

The coarse and impakt- 
able compounds so con- 
stantly met with under the 
denomination of forcemeat, 
even at tables otherwise 
tolerably well served, show 
U with how little attention 
they are commonly pre- 
pared. 
Weighing Machine. Many very indifferent 

cooks pique themselves 6n never doing any thing by rule, and 
the consequence of their throwing together at random (or ^ hy 
guess** as they call it) the ingredients which ought to be pro- 
portioned with eicceeding ddicacy and exactness is, repeated 
failure in all they attempt to do. Long experience, and a veiy 
correct eye may, it is true, enable a person to dispense occasion- 
ally with weignts and measures, wiuiout hazarding the success 
of their operations ; but it is an experiment which the learner 
will do better to avoid. 

A laree marble or Wed^ood mortar is indispensable in 
makiilg all the finer kinds of forcemeat ; and equally so indeed 
for many other purposes in cookery; no kitchen, therefore, 
should be without one ; and for whatever preparation it may 
be used, the pounding should be continued with patience and 
perseverance until not a single lump nor fibre be perceptible in 
the mass of the articles toiten together. This particularly 
applies to potted meats, which should resemble the smoothest 
paste ; as well as to several varieties of forcemeat. Of these 
last it should be observed, that such as are made by the French 
method (see quenelles) are the most appropriate for an elegant 
dinner, either to serve in soups or to fill boned poultry of any 
kind ; but when their exceeding lightness, which to foreigners 
constitutes one of their great excellencies, is objected to, it may 
be remedied by substituting dry crumbs of bread for the 

Cada, and pounding a small quantity of the lean of a boiled 
1, with the other ingredients : however, this should be done 
only for the balls. 



CHAP. TI.] PORCEMfiATS. 148 

Noparticnlar herb or spice should be allowed to predominate 
jwwerriilly in these compositions ; but the whole of the seascm- 
jQgs should be taken in such quanti^ only as will produce an 
agreeable savour when they are blended together. 

HO. 1. GOOD COICMON FOBGEMSAT, TOR ROAST TEAL, 

TURKEYS, &C. 

Grate veiy lightly into exceedingly fine crumbs, four ounces 
of the inside of a stale loaf, and mix thoroughly with it, a quar- 
ter of an ounce of lemon-rind pared as uiin as possible, and 
Diinced extremely small ; the same quantity of savoury herbs, of 
trhich two thirds should be parsley, and one third thyme, like- 
vise fidy minced, a little grated nutmeg, a half teaspoonful of 
^t* and as much common pepper or cayenne as will season the 
forcemeat sufficiently. Break into these, two ounces of good 
butter m veiy small bits, add the unbeaten yolk of one egg, and 
^h the fingers work the whole well together until it is smoothly 
ii^ed. It is usual to chop the lemon-rind, but we prefer it 
lightly grated on a fine grater. It should always be fresh for 
^e purpose, or it will be likelv to impart a very unpleasant fla- 
vour to the forcemeat. Half the rind of a moderate-sized lemon 
^ be sufficient for this quantity ; which for a large turkey 
must be increased one-half: 

Bread-crumbs, 4 ozs. ; lemon-rind, i oz. (or grated rind of i 
lemon) ; mixed savoury herbs, minced, i oz. ; ^t, ^ teaspoon- 
™1; pepper i to i of teaspoonful ; butter, 2 ozs. ; yolk, 1 egg. 

Obi.^T\naj to our taste, is a much nicer and more dehcate 
forcemeat than that which is made with chopped suet, and we 
^ould reconunend it for trial in preference. Any variety of 
l>€rb or spice may be used to give it flavour, and a little minced 
onion or eschalot can be added to it also ; but these last do not 
appear t^ us suited to the meats for which the forcemeat is more 
particularly intended. Half an ounce of the butter may be 
omitted on ordinary occasions : and a portion of marjoram or of 
^eet basil may take the place of part of the thyme and parsley 
^'ben preferred to them. 

EO. 2. ANOTHER GOOD COMMON FORCEMEAT. 

Add to four ounces of bread-crumbs two of the lean of a 
boiled ham, quite free firom sinew, and very finely minced; two 
J^fgood butter, a dessertspoonful of herbs, chopped small, some 
lemon-grate, nutmeg, a little salt, a good seasomng of pepper or 
cayenne, and one whole egg, or the yolks of two. This may be

fried in balls of moderate size, for five minutes, to serve with 
roast yeal, or it may be put into the joint in the usual way. 

Bread-crumbs, 4 ozs. ; lean of ham, 2 ozs. ; batter, 2 ozs. \ 
minced herbs, 1 dessertspoonftd ; lemon-grate^ 1 teu^poonAil ; 
nutmeg, mace, and cayenne, together, 1 sinall teaspoonM ; little 
salt ; 1 whole egg, or yolks of 2. 

NO. 3. SUFEBIOB SUET FORCEMEAT, FOB YEAI^ TUBKETS, &C 

Mix well together six ounces of fine stale crumbs, with an 
equal weight of beef -kidney suet, chopped extremely small, a 
large dessertspoonful of parsley, mixed with a little lemon-thyme, 
a teaspoonM of salt, a quarter one of cayenne, and a saltspooniiil 
or ranier more of mace and nutmeg together ; work these up 
with three unbeaten egg-yolks, and uiree teaspoonsful of milk ; 
then put the forcemeat into a large mortar, and pound it per- 
fectly smooth. Take it out, and let it remain in a cool place 
for half an hour at least before it is used ; then roll it into balls, 
if it be wanted to serve in that form ; flour and fry them gently 
from seven to eight minutes, and dry them well before they are 
dished. 

Beef suet finely minced, 6 ozs. ; bread-crumbs, 6 ozs. ; parsley, 
mixed with little thyme, 1 large dessertspoonful ; salt, 1 tea- 
spoonful; mace, large saltspoonful, and one fourth as much 
cayenne ; unbeaten egg-yolks, 3 ; milk, 3 teasjwonsful : well 
pounded. Fried in baUs, 7 to 8 minutes, or poached, 6 to 7. 

Obs, — The finely grated rind of half a lemon can be added to 
this forcemeat at pleasure ; and for some purposes a moisel of 
garlic, or three or four minced eschalots, may be mixed with it 
before it is put into the mortar. 

NO. 4. COMMON SUET FOBCEMEAT. 

Beef suet is commonly used in the composition of this kind of 
forcemeat, but we think that veal-kidney suet, when it could be 
obtained, would have a better effect ; though the reader wU 
easily comprehend that it is scarcely possible for us to have ever}' 
variety of every receipt which we msert put to the test ; in some 
cases we are compelled merely to suggest what appear to us likely 
to be improvements. Strip carefully every morsel of skin from 
the suet, and mince it small; to six ounces add eight of 
bread-crumbs, with the same proportion of herbs, spice, salt, 
and lemon-peel, as in the foregoing receipt, and a couple of 
whole eggs, which should be very slightly beaten, after the 
specks have been taken out with the point of a small fork. 
Should more liquid be required, the yolk of another egg, or a 



CHAP. TI.] FORCEMBATS. 146 

spoonful or two of milk, may be used. Half this quantity will 
be snffident for a small joint of veal, or for a dozen balls, which, 
when it is more convenient to serve it in that form, may be 
fried or browned beneath the roast, and then dished round it, 
though this last is not a very refined mode of dressing them. 
From dght to ten minutes ynll dry them welL 

VO, 5. OTSTEK FOBCEBfEAT. 

Open carefully a dozen fine plump natives, take off the 
beads, strain their liquor, and nnse the oysters in it Grate 
four onnces of the crumb of a stale loaf into fine light crumbs, 
mince the oysters, but not too small, and mix them with the 
bread; add an ounce and a half of good butter, broken intp minute 
bits, the grated rind of half a small lemon, a small saltspoon- 
^ of pounded mace, some cayenne, a little salt, and a large 
teaspoonful of parsley : mix tnese ingredients well, and work 
them together with the unbeaten yolk of one egg, and a little 
of the oyster liquor, the remainder of which can oe added to th^ 
aance which usually accompanies this forcemeat. 

Oysters, 1 dozen; breadfcrumbs, 4 ozs.; butter, 1) oz.; rind 
i small lemon ; mace, 1 saltspoonfol ; some cayenne and salt ; 
minced parsley, 1 large teaspoonful; yolk 1 egg; oyster-liquor, 
1 dessertspoonM : rolled mto balls, and fnA from 7 to 10 
minutes, or poached from 5 to 6 minutes. 

Ohs.—ln this forcemeat the flavour of the oysters should pre- 
^ entirely over that of all the other ingredients which are 
•mxed with them. 

NO. 6. A futeb otsteb fobcebdbat. 

Pound the preceding forcemeat to the smoothest paste, with 
tbe addition only of half an ounce of fresh butter, should it be 
"efficiently dry to allow of it. It is remarkably good when 
^^^ prepared, and may be poached or fried in balls for soups or 
made dishes, or used to fill boned fowls, or the breasts of boiled 
turkeyB with equally good effect. 

NO. 7. MUSHBOOM FORCEMEAT. 

Cut closely off the stems of some small, just-opened mush- 
^na, peel them, and take out the fur. Dissolve an ounce 
and a Imlf of good butter in a saucepan, throw them into it 
^th a little cayenne, and a slight sprinkling of mace, and stew 
them softly, keeping them well shaken^ froi^ five to seven 
minutes ; then turn them into a dish, spread them over it, and 
^ oue end, Hoi the liquid may drson frt)m them. When 



1 40 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. VI. 

they are quite cold, mince, and then mix them with four 
ounces of fine bread-crumbs, an ounce and a half of good but- 
ter, and part of that in which they were stewed, should the 
forcemeat appear too moist to admit of the whole, as the yolk of 
one egg, at the least, must be added, to bind the ingredients 
together ; strew in a saltspoonful of salt, a third as much of 
cayenne, and about the same quantity of mace and nutmeg, 
with a teaspoonful of grated lemon-rind. The seasonings must 
be rather sparingly used, that the flavour of the mu^irooiiifl 
may not be overpowered by them. Mix the whole thoroughly 
with the unbeaten yolk of one egg, or of two, and use the 
forcemeat poached in small balls for soup, or fried and served 
in the dish with roast fowls, or round minced veal ; or to M 
boiled fowls, partridges, or turkeys. 

Small mushrooms, peeled and trimmed, 4 ozs. ; butter 1} oz.; 
slight sprinkling mace and cayenne : 5 to 7 minutes. Mush- 
rooms minced ; bread-crumbs,/ 4 ozs. ; butter, IJ oz. (with part 
of that used in the stewing) ; salt, 1 saltspoonfol ; third as 
much of cayenne, of mace, and of nutmeg ; grated lemond-rind^ 
1 teaspoonful ; yolk of 1 or 2 eggs. In balls, poached, 1 to 6 
mioutes ; fried, 6 to 8 minutes. 

06^.— -This, like most other forcemeats, is improved by being 
well beaten in a large mortar after it is entirely mixed. 

NO. 8. FOaCESfEAT FOB HABE- 

The first receipt of this chapter will be found very good for 
hare, without any variation; but the liver boiled for five 
minutes, and finely minced, may be added to it, when it is 
thought an improvement : another half ounce of butter, and a 
small portion more of egg will then be required. A couple of 
ounces of rasped bacon, and a glass of port-wine are sometimes 
reconunended for this forcemeat, but we think it is better 
without them, especially when slices of bacon are used to line 
the hare. A flavouring of minced onion, or eschalot can be 
added, when the taste is in its favour ; or the forcem^t l^o. 3 
may be substituted for this altogether.

tvo or three minutes, and shred fine, is sometimes added to 
these, and the whole is bound together with an egg-yolk or 
two; but they are quite as freouently served without. The 
onions can be used raw, when their very strong flavour is not 
objected to, but the odour of the whole dish will then be some- 
what overpowering. 

Large onions, 3 : boiled 20 to 30 minutes. Sage, 2 to 3

NO. 11. eobcebieat baxls fob mock tubtis soups. 

The French forcemeat, No. 17 of the present Chapter, is the 
most elegant and appropriate forcemeat to serve in mock turtle, 
but a more solid and highly seasoned one is usuaUy added to it 
ui this country. In very common cookery the ingredients are 
o^iely chopped small and mixed t<^ether with a moistening of 
^ ; but ^en the trouble of pounding and blending them 
properly is objected to, we would recommend the common veal 
ibicemeat. No. 1, in preference, as the undressed veal and suet, 
when merely minced, do not produce a good effect. Four 
ounces each of these, with an ounce or so of the lean of a boiled 
^ and three ounces of bread-crumbs, a large dessertspoonful 
of minced parsley, a small portion of thyme, or marjoram, a 
^tspoonM of white pepper, twice as much salt, or more, a 
little cayenne, half a small nutmeg, and ^ couple of eggs, well 
loixed with a fork first, to separate the meat, and alter the 
moistening is added, with the fingers, then rolled into balls, and 
boiled in a little soup for twelve minutes, is the manner in 
>^hich it is prepared ; but the reader will find the following 
receipt very superioi^to it :— Rasp, that is to say, scrape with a 
knife, clear from the fibre, four ounces of veal, which should be 
cat into thick slices, and taken quite free from skin and fat ; 
chop it fine, and then pound it as smoothly as possible in a large 
mortar, with three ounces of the rasped fat of an unboiled ham^ 
^ good flavour, or of the finest bacon, and one of butter, two 
ounces of bread-crumbs, a tablespoonful of the lean of a boiled 
ham, should it be at hand, a good seasoning of cayenne, nutmeg, 
uid mace, mixed together, a heaped dessertspoonM of mincm 



148 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAF. YI. 

herbs, and the yolks of two eggs ; poach a small bit when it is 
mixed, and wad any Airther seasoning it may require; and 
when it is of good flavour, roll it into balls of moderate size, and 
boil them twelve minutes ; then drain and slip them into the 
soup. No forcemeat should be boiled in the soup itself, on 
account of the fat which would escape from it in the process : a 
little stock should be reserved for the purpose. 

Very common :— Lean of neck of veal, 4 ozs. ; beef-kidney 
suet, 4 ozs., both finely chopped ; bread-crumbs, 3 ozs. ; miooed 
parslev, large dessertspoonml ; thyme or marjoram, small tea- 
spoonml ; lean of boiled ham, 1 to 2 ozs. ; white pepper, 1 salt- 
spoonful ; salt, twice as much ; ^ small nutmeg ; ^gs, 2 : in balls, 
12 minutes. 

Better forcemeat : — Lean veal rasped, 4 ozs. ; fat of unboiled 
ham, or finest bacon, 3 ozs. ; butter, 1 oz. ; bread-crumbs, 2 ozs.; 
lean of boiled ham, minced, 1 large tablespoonfiil ; minced herbs, 
1 heaped dessertspoonful ; ^11 seasoning of mace, nutmeg, and 
cayenne, mixed ; yolks of eggs, 2:12 minutes. 

NO. 12. EGO BALLS. 

Boil four or five new-laid eggs for ten or twelve minutes, and 
lay them into fresh water until they are cold. Take out the 
yolks, and pound them smoothly vdtn the beaten yolk of one 
raw egg, or more, if required ; add a little salt and cayenne, 
roll the mixture into very small balls, and boil them for two 
minutes. Half a teaspoonful of flour is sometimes worked up 
with the eggs. 

Hard ycdks of eggs, 4 ; 1 raw ; little salt, cayenne : 2 minutes. 

NO. 13. BBAIN CAKES. 

Wash and soak the. brains well in cold water, and afterwards 
in hot; then remove the skin and large fibres, and boil them in 
water, slightly salted, from two to three minutes; beat them up 
with a teaspoonful of sage, very finely chopped, or with equal 
parts of sage and parsley, half a teaspoonml or rather more of 
salt, half as much mace, a little white pepper or cayenne, and 
one egg ; drop them in small cakes, and fry them a fine light 
brown : two yolks of eggs will make the cakes more delicate 
than the white and yolk of one. A teaspoonfiil of flour and a 
little lemon-grate are sometimes added.

fine biead-crombs, mixed with salt, pounded spices, and fine 
herbs, minced extremely small ; fry them of a light brown, 
drab and dry them well, and slip them into the soup or hash 
after it is dished. When broth or gravy is not at nand, the 
brains may be boiled in water. 

so. -15. CHESTNTT FOSCSMEAT. 

Strip the outer skin from some fine sound chestnuts, then 
throw them into a saucepan of hot water, and set them over the 
&% for a minute or two, when they may easily be blanched like 
almo&ds. Put them into cold water as they are peeled. Dry 
them in a cloth, and weigh them. Stew six ounces of them very 
gently fi^m fifiieen to twenty minutes, in just sufficient strong 
veal-graw to cover them. Take them up, drain them on a 
sieve, and when cold pound them perfectly smooth with half 
their weight of the nicest bacon, ra^)ed dear from all rust or 
fibre, or with an equal quantity of fresh butter, two ounces of 
dry bread-crumbs, a sinall teaspoonfiil of grated lemon rind, 
one of salt, half as much mace or nutmeg, a moderate quantity 
of cayenne, and the unbeaten yolks of two or of three eggs. 
This mixture makes most excellent forcemeat cakes, which must 
be moulded with a knife, a spoon, or the fingers, dipped in 
fionf; more should be dredged over, and preyed upon them, 
^ they should be slowly fried frx)m ten to fifteen mmutes. 

Chestnuts, 6 ozs. ; veal-gravy, } of a pint : 15 to 20 minutes. 
Bacon or butter, 3 ozs. ; bread-crumbs, 2 ozs.; lemon-peel and 
%lt, 1 teaspoonful each. 

NO. 16. AN EXCELLENT FRENCH FOBCEMEAT. 

Take six ounces of veal free from fat and skin, cut it into dice 
and put it into a saucepan with two ounces of butter, a large 
teaspoonM of parslej finely minced, half as much thyme, salt, 
^ grated lemon-rmd, and a sufficient seasoning of nutmeg, 
cayenne, and mace, to fiavour it pleasantly. Stew these very 
g^tly from twelve to fifteen minutes, then lift out the veal and 
pat into the saucepan two oimces of bread-crumbs ; let them 
simmer until they have alfiorbed the gravy yielded by the meat; 
^ them stirred until they are as dry as possible; beat the 
yolk of an ^g to them while they are hot, and set them aside to 
pool Chop and pound the veal, add the bread to it as soon as 
it is cold, beat them well together, with an ounce and a half of 
teh butter, and two of the finest bacon, scraped quite clear 
from rust, skin, and fibre ; put to them the yolks of two 



150 MODEUN COOKERY- [cHAP. VT. 

small eggs, and mix them well ; then take the forcemeat from 
the mortar, and set it in a yery cool place until it is wanted for 
use. 

Veal, 6 ozs. ; butter, 2 ozs. ; minced parsley, 1 teaspoonfol ; 
thyme, salt, and lemon-peel, each ^ teaspoon^l; little nut- 
meg, cayenne, and mace : 12 to 15 minutes. Bread-crambs, 
2 ozs. ; butter, 1} oz. ; rasped bacon, 2 ozs. ; yolks of eggs, 
2 to 3. 

Ohs, 1. — When this forcemeat is intended to fill boned fowls, 
the livers of two or three, boiled for four minutes, or stewed 
with the veal for the same length of time, then minced and 
pounded with the other ingredients, will be found a gr^ at im- 
provement; and, if mushrooms can be procured, two table- 
spoonsful of them chopped small, should be stewed and beaten 
with it also. A small portion of the best end of the neck will 
afford the quantity of lean required for this receipt, and the re- 
mains of it will make excellent gravy. 

NO. 17. FRENCH FOBCEMEAT CALLED QUENELLES. 

This is a peculiarly light and delicate kind of forcemeat, 
which by good French cooks is compounded with exceeding 
care. It is served abroad in a variety of forms, and is made oi 
very finely-grained white veal, or of the undressed flesh of 
poultry, or of rabbits, rasped quite free from sinew, then chopped 
and pounded to the finest paste, first by itself, and aflerw^ 
with an equal quantity of boiled calTs udder or of butter, and 
of panada, which is but another name for bread soaked in cream 
or gravy and then dried over the fire until it forms a sort of 
paste. As the three ingredients should be equal in volume, not 
m weight, they are each rolled into a separate ball before they 
are mixed, that their size may be determined by the eye. When 
the fat of the fillet of veal (which in England is not often 
divided for sale, as it is in France) is not to be procured, a rather 
less proportion of butter will serve in its stead. The following 
will be found a very good, and not a troublesome receipt for 
veal forcemeat of this kind. 

Easp quite clear from sinew, after the fat and skin have been 
entirely cleared from it, four ounces of the finest veal; chop, 
and pound it well : if it be carefully prepared there will be ho 
necessity for passing it through a sieve, but this should other- 
wise be done. Soak in a small saucepan two ounces of the 
crumb of a stale loaf in a little rich but pale veal gravy, or 
white sauce ; then press and drain as much as possible of the 
moisture from it, and stir it over a gentle fire until it is as dry 



CHAP. VI.] FORCEMEATS. » 151 

as it will become -without burning : it will adhere in a ball to 
the spoon, and leave the saucepan quite diy when it is sufficiently 
done. Mix with it, while it is still hot, the yolk of one egg, and 
when it is quite cold, add it to the veal with three ounces of veir 
fresh butter, a quarter-teaspoonfiil of mace, half as much 
tayenne, a little nutmeg, and a saltspoonful of salt. When 
these are perfectly beaten, and well blended together, add 
another whole egg niter having merely taken out the germs ; 
the mixture will then be ready for use, and may be moulded 
into balls, or small thick oval shapes, a little flattened, and 
poached in soup or gravy from ten to fifteen minutes. , These 
quenelles may be served by themselves in a rich sauce, as a 
comer dish, or in conjunction with other things. They may 
likewise be first poached for three or four minutes, and left on 
a drainer to become cold ; then dipped into egg and the finest 
bread-crumbs, and fried, and served as croquettes. 

na 18. FORCEMEAT FOB RAISED AND OTHER COLD PIES. 

The very finest sausage-meat, highly seasoned, and made with 
an equal proporticm of fat and lean, is an exceedingly good 
fiHoemeat for veal, chicken, rabbit, and some few other pies ; 
sayooij herbs minced small, may be added to heighten its fla- 
voor, if it be intended for immediate eating ; but it will not 
&en remain ^ood quite so long, unless they should have been 
prevkmsly dned. To prevent its being too dry, two or three 
spooDsM of cold water should be mixed with it before it is put 
into the pie. One pound <^ lean veal to one and a quarter of 
the pork-fat is sometimes used, and smoothly pounded with a 
high seasoning of spices, herbs, and eschalots, or garlic, but we 
cannot recommend the introduction of these last into pies unless 
they are especially ordered : mushrooms may be mixed with any 
kiiid of forcemeat with far better effect. Equid parts of veal 
and fiit bacon, will also make a good forcemeat for pies, if 
dumped finely, and well spiced. 

Sausage-meat, well seasoned. Or: veal, 1 lb.; ]pork-&t,

milk, or cream, as will cover and moisten it well ; put a plate 
over to keep in the steam, and let it remain for half an hour, 
or more ; then drain off the superfluous liquid, and squeeze the 
panada dry hy wringing it roimd in a thm cloth into a hall ; 
put it into a small stewpan, or well tinned saucepan, and pour 
to it as much only of rich white sauce or of gravy, as it can 
easily ahsorb, and stir it constantly with a wooden spoon, over 
a clear and gentle fire, until it forms a very dry paste, and ad- 
heres in a mass to the spoon ; when it is in this state, mix with 
it, thoroughly, the unb&iten yolk of two fresh eggs, which will 
dve it firmness, and set it aside to become quite cold before it 
IS put mto the mortar. The best French cooks give the highest 
degree of savour that they can to this panada, and add no other 
seasoning to the forcemeats of which it forms a part : it is used 
in an coual proportion with the meat, and calf *s udder or butter 
of whioi they aire composed, as we have shown in the preceding 
receipt for auenelles. They stew slowly for the purpose, a 
small bit of lean ham, two or three minced eschalots, a bayleai^ 
a few mushrooms, a little parsley, a clove or two, and a small 
blade of mace, in a little good butter, and when they are suffi- 
ciently browned, pour to them as much broth or gravy as iwill 
be needed for the panada; and when .this has simmered from 
twenty to thirty minutes, so as to have acquired the proper 
flavour, without being much reduced, they strain it over, and 
boil it into the bread. The common course of cookery in an 
English kitehen does not often require the practice of the greater 
niceties and refinements of the art : and trouble (of which tiie 
French appear to be perfectly r^;ardle8S when the excellence of 
their preparations is concerned) is there in general so much 
thought 0^ and exclaimed against, that a more summary pro- 
cess would probably meet witn a better chance of success. 

A quicker and roi^her mode of making the panada, and 
indeed the forcemeat altogether, is' to pour s&ong v^ broth or 
gravy upon it, and after it has soaked, to boil it dry, without 
any addition except that of a little fine spice, lemon-grate, or any 
oUier&vourite English seasoning. Minced herbs, salt, cayenne, 
and mace may be beaten with the meat, to which a SEoall 
portion of well-pounded ham, may likewj^ be added at pleasure.

CHAPTER Vn. 
BOILING, ROASTING, &c. 

TO BOIL MXAT. 

Large joints of meat should be neatly 

tiimmed, washed extremely clean, and 

skewered or bound firmly into good 

shape, when they are of a nature to 

require it; then well covered with 

cold water, brought to boil over a 

moderate fire, and simmered until 

tbev are done, the scum being care- 

fullv and entirely cleaned from the j^^ ^^^^ 

surface of the water, as it gathers 

there, which will be prindpaUy from within a few minutes of 

its beginning to boil, and during a few minutes afterwards. If 

not thoroughly skimmed off at the proper time, it will sink, and 

adhere to tne joint, giving it a very uninviting appearance. 

We cannot too strongly again impress upon the cook the 
advantages of gentle simmering over the usual fast-boiling of 
meat, by which, as^ has been a&eady forcibly shown (see article 
BouiUon^ Chapter I.), the outside is hardened and deprived of 
its juices before the inside is half done, while the starting of 
the flesh from the bones which it occasions, and the altogether 
nigged aspect which it gives, are most unsightly. Pickled or 
saSed meat requires longer boiling than fresh ; and that which 
is nnoked and dried longer still. This last should always be 
slowly heated, and if, from any drcnmstances, time cannot have 
been allowed for soaking it properly, and there is a probability 
of its bein^ too salt when served, it should be brought very 
softiv to boil in a large quantity of water, which should in part 
be changed as soon as it becomes quite briny, for as much more 
that is ready boiling. 

It is customaiy to lay large joints 
upon a fish-plate, or to throw some 
wooden skewers under them, to 
prevent their sticking to the vessel* 
m which they are cooked; and it is 
as well to take the precaution, though, 
unless they be placed over a very 
fierce fire, they cannot be in danger 

of this. The time allowed for them Large copper or iron Stockpot.*

paetly arranged that it will neither require to be disturbed, 
nor supplied with fresh ^el, for some considerable time after 
the meat is laid down. Spit the joint and place it very far from 
the fire at first ; keep it constantly basted, and when it is two 

Earta done, move it nearer to the fire that it may be properly 
rowned; but guard carefully against it being burned. A few 
minutes before it is taken from the spit, sprinkle a little fine 
salt over it, baste it thoroughly with its own dripping, or with 
butter, and dredge it with flour : as soon as the froth is well 
risen, dish, and serve the meat. Or, to avoid the necessity of 
the frothing which is often greatly objected to on account of the 
raw taste retained by the flour, ^edge the roast liberally soon 
afler it is first laid to the fire ; the flour will then form a savoury 
incrustation upon it, and assist to prevent the escape of its juices. 
When meat or poultry is wrapped in buttered paper it must not 
be floured until this is removed, which should be fifteen or 
twenty minutes before either is served. 

Remember always to draw back the dripping-pan when the 
fire has to be stirred, or when fresh coals are thrown on, that 
the cinders and ashes may not fisJl into it. 

When meat is very lean, a sjice of butter, or a small quantity 
of clarified dripping should be melted in the pan to baste it with 
at first ; though the use of the latter should be scrupulously 
avoided for poultry, or any delicate meats, as the flavour it 
imparts is to many persons peculiarly objectionable. Let the 
spit be kept bright and clean, and wipe it before the meat is put 
on ; balance the joint well upon it, that it may turn steadily, 
and if needful secure it witn screw-skewers. A cradle spit, 
which is so constructed that it contains the meat in a sort of 
framework, instead of passing through it, may be often veiy 
advantageously used instead of an ordinary one, as the perfora- 
tion of the meat by this last must always occasion some escape 
of the juices ; and it is, moreover, particularly to be objected to 
in roasting joints or poultry which have been boned and filled 
with forcemeat. The cradle spit (for which see "Turkey 
Boned and Forced," Chapter XII.) is much better suited to 
these, as well as to a sucldng pig, sturgeon, salmon, and other 
large fish ; but it is not very commonfy to be found in our 
kitchens, many of which exhibit a singular scantiness of the 
conveniences which facilitate the labours of the cook. 

For heavy and substantial joints, a quarter of an hour is gene- 
rally allowed for every pound of meat ; and with a sound fire 
and frequent basting, will be foimd sufficient when the process 
is conducted in the usual manner ; but by the' slow method^ as we 
shall designate it, almost double the time will be required. Pork, 



CHAP. TII,^ BOILING, ROASTING, &C. 157 

Teal, and Iamb, should always be well roasted ; but many eaters 
prefer mutton and beef rather tmder-dressed, though some per- 
sons have a strong objection to the sight even of any meat that 
is not ^oroughly cooked. 

Joints which are thin in proportion to their weight, require 
less of the fire than thick and solid ones. Ribs of beef, for 
example, will be sooner ready to serve than an equal weight of 
the rump, round, or sirloin ; and the neck or shoulder of mut- 
ton, or spare rib of pork, than the leg. , 

When to preserve the succulence of the meat is more an 
object than to economize ^el, beef and mutton should be laid at 
twice the usual distance from the fire, and allowed to remain so 
until they are perfectly heated through ; the roasting, so ma- 
naged, will of course be slow ; and from three hours and a half 
to four hours will be necessary to cook by this method a leg of 
mutton of ordinary size^ for which two hours would amply suf- 
fice in a common way ; but the fiesh will be remarkably tender, 
and the flow of gravy from it most abundant. It should not be 
drawn near the fire until within the last hour, and should then 
be placed only so close as to brown it properly. No kind of 
roast indeed should at any time be allowed to take colour too 
quickly ; it should be heated gradually, aiid kept at least at a 
moderate distance from the fire until it is nearly done, or the 
outside will be dry and hard, if not burned, while the inside will 
be only half cooked. 

STEAMING. 

The application of steam to culinary 
pQiposes is becoming very general in 
our kitchens at the present day, espe? 
dally in those of large establishments, 
many of which are furnished with 
apparatus for its use, so admirably 
constructed, and so complete, that the 
process may be conducted on an ex- 
tensive scale, with very slight trouble „ . ^ ^

advantage of being at a distance from the fir e, the steam being 
conveyed by pipes to the vessels intended to receive it. Fish, 
bntcher*s meat, poultry, vegetables, puddings, maccaroni, and 
rice, are all subjected to its action, instead of being immersed in 
water, as in simple boiling ; and the result is to many persons 
perfectly satisfactory; though, as there is a diffierence of 
opinion amongst first-rate oo&Sy with regard to the comparative

[chap. VII. 



merits of the two modes of dresdng meat axidjish, a trial sboulc 
be given to the steaming, on a small scale, before any grea 
expenses are incurred for it, which may be done easily with i 
common saucepan or boiler, fitted like the one shown above, 
with a simple tin steamer. Servants not accustomed to the use 
of these, should be warned against boiling in the vessel itself 
any thing of coarse or strong flavour, when the article steamed 
is of a delicate nature. The vapour from soup containing 
onions, for example, would have a very bad eflect on a sweet 
pudding especially, and on many other dishes. Care and dis- 
cretion, therefore, must be exercised on this point. By meaos 
of a kettle fixed over it, the steam of the boiler in the kitchen 
range, may be made available for cooking, in the way shovm by 

the engraving, which exhibits fish, 
potatoes, and their sauces, all in 
progress' of steaming at the same 
time.* The limits of our work do 
not permit us to enter at much 
length upon this subject, but the 
reader who may wish to under- 
stand the nature of steam, and the 
various modes in which its agency 
maybe applied to domestic pur- 
poses, will do well to consult Mr. 
Webster's excellent work,*f" of which we have more particularly 
spoken in another chapter. The quite inexperienced cook may 
require to be told, that any article of food which is to be cooked 
by steam in a saucepan of the form exhibited in the first of the 
engravings of this section, must be prepared - exactly as for 
boiling, and laid into the sort of strainer afiixed to the top of 
the saucepan ; and that water, or some other kind of Uquid, 
must be put into the saucepan itself, and kept boiling in it, the 
lid being first closely fixed into the steamen

STEWING. 



This very wholesome, convenient, and economical mode of 
cookery is by no means so well understood nor profited by in 
England as on the continent, where its advantages are iully 
appreciated. So very small a quantity of fuel is necessary to 
sustain the gentle degree of ebullition which it requires, that 
this alone would reconunend it to. the careful housekeeper; but

if the process be skilfully 
conducted, meat softly 
stoved or stewed, in close- 
shutting, or luted vessels, 
is in every respect equal, if 
not superior, to that which 
is roasted ; but it must be 
mtmered only, and in the 
gentlest possible manner, 
or, instead of being ten- 
der, nutritious, and highly 
palatable, it will be dry, 
hard, and indigestible. 
The conunon cooking stoves in this country, as they have 
hitherto been constructed, have rendered the exact regula- 
tion of heat which stewhig requires rather difficult; and 
the smoke and blaze of a large coal fire are very un&vourable 
to many other modes of cookery as well. The French have 
generally the advantage of the embers and ashes of the wood 
which is their ordinary iiiel ; and they have always, in addit'on, 
a stove of this construction in which charcoal or braise (for 
explanation of this word, see remarks on preserving, Chapter 
XXL) only is burned; and upon which their stewpans can, 
when there is occasion, be left un- 
covered, without the danger of, 
their contents being spoiled, which ' 
there generally is witn us. It is 
true that of late great improve- 
ments have been made in our own 

stoves; and the hotplates, or hearths 

with which the kitchens of good houses are always furnished, 
are admirably adapted to the simmering system ; but when the 
cook has not the convenience of one, the stewpans must be 
placed on trevets high above the fire, and be constantly watched, 
and moved, as occasion may require, nearer to, or further from 
the fiame. 

Ko copper vessels from which the inner tinning is in the 
slightest de^ee worn away should be used ever for this or for 
any other kmd of cookery ; or not health only, but life itself

that they retain the heat so long, that the contents will boil -for 
several minutes afier they are removed from the fire, and Ibis 
must be guarded against when they have reached the exact 
point, at which iuiuier boiling would have a bad e^ct; as 
would be the case with some preservea, and other sweets-

sant eating. A brisk fire perfectly free from smoke^ a very 
dean gridiron, tender meat, a oish and plates as hot as they can 
be, and great despatch in sending it to table when done, are all 
essential to the serving of a good broil. The gridiron should be 
veil heated, and rubbed with mutton suet before the meat is 
laid on, and it should be placed slopingly over the fire, that the 
fat may run off to the back of the grate, instead of falling on 
• the live coals and smoking the meat: if this precaution should 
not prevent its making an occasional blaze, lilt the gridiron 
quickly beyond the readi of the smoke, and hold it away imtil 
the fire is dear again. Steaks and chops should be turned 
often, that the juices may be kept in, and that they may be 
equally done in every part. If, for this purpose, it should be 
necessary, for want ot steak-tongs, to use a fork, it should be 
passed through the outer skin, or fat of the steak, but never 
stack into the lean, as by that means much of the gravy will 
escape. Most eaters prefer broiled beef or mutton, rather 
nnder-dressed ; but pork chops should always be thoroughly 
cooked. When a fowl or any other bird is cut asunder before 
it is broiled, the inside shomd first be laid to the fire : this 
should be done with kidneys also. Fish is less dry, and of bet- 
ter flavour, as well as less liable to be smoked, if it be wrapped 
in a thickly buttered sheet of writing paper before it is placed 
on the gridiron. For the more delicate-skinned kinds, the bars 
should be rubbed with chalk instead of suet, when the paper is 
omitted. Cutlets, or meat in any other form, when egged and 
crumbed for broiling, should afterwards be dipped into clarified 
butter, or sprinkled with it plentifully, as the egg-yolk and 
bread will otherwise form too dry a crust upon it. French 
cooks season their cutlets both with salt and pepper, and brush 
a little oil or butter over them to keep them moist ; but unless 
this be done, no Reasoning of salt should be given them until 
they are just ready to be dished : the French method is a very 
good one.

page, and called a coiynrer. Lin off the 
cover and lay in the meat properly sea- 
soned, with a small slice of butter under it, 
and insert the lighted paper in the aper- 
ture shown in the plate ; in from eight to 
ten minutes the meat will be done, and 
found to be remarkably tender, and very 
palatable: it must be turned and moved 
occasionally during the process. This is an 
especially convenient mode of cooking for 
persons whose hours of dining are rendered 
uncertain by the nature of their avocations. 
For medical men engaged in extensive 
country practice it has l^n ofleh proved 
so. The conjurer costs but a few shillings. Another form of 
this economical apparatus, with which a pint of water may be 
made to boil by means of only a sheet of paper wrapped round 
a cone, in the mside, is shown in the second plate. 

This is an operation, which, though 
apparently very simple, requires to be 
more carefully and skilfully conducted 
than it commonly is. Its success de- 
pends principally on allowing the fat to 
attain the exact degree of heat which 
shall give fimmess, without too quick browning or scorching, 
before anything is laid into the pan ; for if this be neglected 
the article iried will be saturated with the fat, and remam pie 
and flaccid. When the requisite degree of colour is acquired 
before the cooking is complete, the pan should be placed high 
above the fire, that it may be continued slowly to the proper 
point. Steaks and cutlets should be seasoned with salt and 
pepper, and dredged on both sides lightly with flour before 
they are laid into the pan, in which they should be often 
moved and turned, that they may be equally done, and that 
they may not stick nor bum to it. From ten to fifteen minutes 
will fry them. They should be evenly sliced, about the same 
thickness as for broiling, and neatly trinmied and divided in the 
first instance. Lift them into a hot dish when done ; pour the 
fat from the pan, and throw in a small slice of butter; stir to

or water, to keep it covered in every part until done ; good soap 
also may be made in the same way, tne usual ingredients being 
at once added to the meat, with the exception of the v^tables, 
which will not become tender if put into cold liquor, and should 
therefore be thrown in after it begins to simmer. Baking is 
likewise one of the best modes of dressing various kinds of fish : 
pike and red mullet amongst others. Sabnon cut into thick 
slices, freed from the skin, well seasoned with spice, mixed with 
salt (and with minced herbs, at j^leasure), then arranged evenly 
in a dish, and covered thickly with crumbs of bread, moistened 
with clarified butter, as directed in Chapter n., for baked soles, 
and placed in the oven for about half an hour, will be found very 
rich and highlv flavoured. Part of the middle of the salmon 
left entire, well cleaned, and thoroughlv dried, then seasoned, 
and securely wrapped in two or three folds of thickly buttered 
paper, will also prove excellent eating, if gently baked. (This 
may likewise be roasted in a Dutch oven, either folded in the 
paper, or left without it, and basted with butter.) 

Hams, when freshly cured, and not over salted, if neatly 
trimmed, and closely wrapped in a coarse paste, are both more 
juicy, and of finer flavour baked than boiled. Savouiy or 
pickled beef, too, put into a deep pan, with a little gravy, and 
plenty of butter, or chopped suet on the top, to prevent the 
outside from becoming dry ; then covered with paste, or with 
several folds of thick paper, and set into a moderate oven for 
four or five hours, or even longer, if it be of large weight, is an 
excellent dish. A goose, a le^ of pork, and a sucking pig, if 
properly attended to while in tne oven, are said to be nearly, or 
quite as good as if roasted ; but baking is both an impalatable 
and an unprofitable mode of cooking joints of meat m general, 
though its great convenience to many persons who have but f<^ 
other facilities for obtaining the luxury of a hot dinner renders 
it a very common one. 

It is usual to raise meat from the dish in which it is sent to 
the oven by placing it, properly skewered, on a stand, so as to 
allow potatoes or a batter puddmg to be baked under it. A few 
button onions, freed from the outer skin, or three or four large 
ones, cut in halves, are sometimes put beneath a shoulder of 
mutton. Two sheets of paper spread separately with a thick 

ftronglf, bread, cakeg, and pies, can be perfectly well baked before a large clear 
fire; bu^ as we have stated in another part of our work, the consumption of fuel 
necessary to the process renders it far from economical. A spit has lately been 
inirotluced into some of the American ovens, converting them at once into 
portable and convenient roasters. 




CHAP. YII.] BOILING, ROASTINO, &C. 165 

layer of batter, clarified marrow, or any other &t, and fiistened 
eecnrely oyer the outside of a joint, will prevent its being too 
much dried by the fierce heat of the oven. A few spoonsful of 
water or gravy should be poured into the dish witn potatoes, 
and a little salt sprinkled over them. 

A celebrated ^ench cook recommends braising in the oven .* 
that is to say, after the meat has been arrang^ in the usual 
manner, and just brought to boil over the fire, that the braising 
pan, closely stopped, should be put into a moderate oven, for the 
same length of time as would be required to stew the meat 
perfectly tender. 

BBAISING. 

Bndfiing is but a more expen- 
fiive mode of stewing meat. The 
following French recipe will ex- 
plain the process. We would 
observe, however, that the layers 
of heef or veal, in which the joint 
to be braised is imbedded, can 
afterwards be converted into ex- 
cellent soup, gravy, or glaze ; and Engiuh Braising-puu 
that there need, in consequence, be no waste, nor any unreason- 
able d^pree of expense attending it; but it is a troublesome 
process, and quite as good a result may be obtained by sinuner- 
ing the meat in very strong gravy. Should the flavour of the 
bacon be considered an advantage, slices of it can be laid over 
the article braised, and secured to it with a fillet of tape. 

^ To braise the inside (or small Met^ as it is called in France) 
of a sirloin of beef : Raise the fillet clean from the joint ; and 
vdth a sharpKni^ stripoff all the skin, leaving the surmce of the 
meat as smooth as possible ; have ready some strips of unsmoked 
bacon, half as thick as your little finger, roll them in a mix- 
toie of thyme finely minced, spices in powder, and a little pepper 
and salt. Lard the fillet quite through with these, and tie it 
round with tape in any shape you choose. Line the bottom of 
a stewpan (or braising-pan) with slices of bacon ; next put in a 
layer of beef, or veal, mur onions, two bay-leaves, two carrots, 
and a bunch of sweet* herbs, and place the fillet on theuL 
Cover it with slices of bacon, put some trimmings of meat all 
ronnd it, and pour on to it half a pint of good bouillon or gravy. 
Let it stew as gently as possible for two hours and a half; take 
it up, and keep it very hot ; strain, and reduce the gravy by 
quick boiling until it is thick enough to glaze with ; brush the

meat over with it ; put the rest in the dish with the fillet, after 
the tape has heen removed from it, and send it directly to 
table/ 

Equal parts of Madeira and gravy are sometimes used to 
moisten the meat 

No attempt should he made to braise a joint in any vessel 
that is not verv nearly of its own size. 

A round of buttered paper is generally put over the more 
delicate kinds of braised meat, to prevent their being browned 
by the fire, which in France is put round the lid of the braisiDg- 
pan, in a groove made on purpose to contain it. The embers of 
' a wood fire wixed with the hot ashes, are best adapted to sustain 
the regular, but gentle d^iree of heat required for this mode of 
cooking. 
The pan shown at the head of this section, with a closely 

fitting copper tray, serving for the 
cover, is used commonly m Eng- 
land for braising; but a stewpan 
of modem form, or any otner 
vessel which will admit of embers 
being placed upon the lid, will 
answer for the purpose as well.

Larding Piof. 

Cut into slices, of the same length and thickness, some bacon 
of the finest quality ; trim awa^ the outsides, place the slices 
eveidy upon each other, and with a sharp knife divide them 
obliquelv into small strips of equal size. For pheasants, par- 
tridges, nares, fowls, and Iricandeaux, the bacon should be aboat 
the eighth of an inch square, and two inches in length ; but for 
meat which is to be larded quite thiDugh, instead of on the 
outside merely, the bits of bacon (properly called hurdoons) must 
be at least the third of an inch square. 

In general, the breasts only of birds are larded, the backs and 
thighs of hares, and the whole of the upper surface of a firican- 
deau: these should be thickly covered with small lardoopfli 



CHAP, yn.] BOXLnco, ROAsmfo, &o, 167 

placed at ic^olar intervals, and in lines which Intenect each 
other, 80 as to fonn rather minute diamonds. 

The following directions for larding a pheasant will serve 
ojoally for poiSry, or for other kinds of game : — 

Secure one end of the bacon in a slight larding-pm, and on 
the point of this take np sufficient of the flesh of the bird to 
hold the lardoon firmly ; draw the pin through it, and part of 
the bacon, of which the two ends should be left of equal length, 
Proo^ thus, until the breast of the pheasant is entirely gar- 
nidud with lardoons, when it ought to resemble in appearance 
a cake thickly stuck with slips of almonds. 

The larger strips of bacon, after being rolled in a high sea- 
soniiig of minced herbs and spices, are. used to lard the inside 
of meat, and they should be proportioned to its thicknesB, aa 
th^ must be paired quite throi^h it. For example : a four- 
inch slice from a rump of beef will require lardoons of very 
nearly that length, which must be drawn Uirough with a large 
larduig-pin, smd left in it, with the ends just out of sight on 
either side. 

In France, truffles, anchovies, slices of tongue, and of fiit, 
all trimmed into proper shape, are occasionally used for larding. 
The bacon employed there for the purpose is cured without any 
saltpetre (as this would redden the white meats), and it is never 
smoked : the receipt for it will be found in Chapter XL 

A turkey is sometimes larded with alternate lardoons of flit 
bacon and of bollock's tongue, which has been pickled but 
not dried : we apprehend that the lean of a half-boiled ham, 
of good colour, could answer the purpose quite as well, or 
better. 

Larding the surface of meat, poultry, or game, gives it a good 
appearance, but it is a more positive improvement to meat of a 
dry nature to interlard the inside witn large lardocHis of well- 
seasoned, delicate, striped English bacon. 

BONINO* 

Very minute directions being given in other parts of our 
volume for this, we confine ourselves here to the following 
ndes: — ^in disengaging the flesh from it, work the knife always 
dose to the hone^ and take every care not to pierce the outer 

skin.

a few miimtes, which giyes finnness to the first, and is necessary 
for some modes of pr^parin^ vegetables. 

The breast only or a bird is sometimes held in the water 
while it boils, to render it firm for larding. To preserve the 
whiteness of meat, and the bright green of vegetables, they are 
lifted from the water after they have boiled a few minutes, 
and are thrown immediately into spring water, and left till 
cold. 

5 to 10 minutes. 

GLAZING. 

This process we have explained 
at the article Glaze^ Chapter IIL 
The surface of the meat ^ould be 
covered evenly, with two or three 
separate layers of the glaze, which, 
)if properly made, soon becomes 
firm. A liam should be well dried 
in the oven before it is laid on. 
Cutlets of all kinds may be glazed 
before they are sent to table, with 
very good efiect. The figure above 
represents a glaze-pot and brush, 
used for heating and applying the preparation : a jar placed in 
a pan of boiling water may be substituted for the first, when it 
is not at hand.

A venr cheap apparatus, by which chops can be dressed before 
a clear fire, is shown by the first of these figures; and the second

time and attention being bestowed upon them.

TO CHOOSE BEEF. 

If young and freshly killed, the lean of ox-beef "mil be 
smoothly gramed, and of a fine, healthy, carnation-red, the 
fat rather white than yellow, and the snet white and fiiOL 
Heifer-beef is more closely grained, and rather less bright of 
colour, the bones are considerably smaller, and the fiit of a purer 
white. 

Of bull-beef we only speak to warn our readers, that it is of all 
meat the coarsest and the most rank in flavour. It n»y be 
known by its dark hue, its dose tough fibre, and the samty 
proportion, bad appearance, and strong odour of its fat. 

In choice and well-fed beef, the lean will be found intergrained 
with fat : very lean meat is always of an inferior quali^. 

The ribs, the sirloin, and the rump, are the proper joints for 
roasting. The round, or. buttock, the edgebone, the second 
round, or mouse-buttock, the shin, the brisket, the shoulder or leg 
of mutton piece, and the dod may be boiled or^stewed. The 
neck is generally used for soup or gravy ; and the thin flank for 
collaring. The best steaks are cut from the middle of the romp; 
the next best from the veiny piece, or from the chuck-rib. The 
inside of the sirloin, commoiUy used for the purpose in France, 
makes by far the most delicate steaks ; but though exceedingly 
tender, they are considered by English epicures to be wantmg 
in flavour. 

The finest part of the sirloin is the chump-end, which contains 
the larger portion of the fillet : of the ribs, the middle ones are 
those generally preferred by experienced housekeepers. 

TO BOAST SIBLOIN, OB BIBS OF BEEF. 

Let the joint hane as long as it can possibly be kept perfectly 
sweet. When it is first brought in, remove tne pipe of^marrow 
which runs along the backbone ; and cut out the Kernels firom 
the fat. Be very careful in summer to guard it from flies; 
examine it frequeutly in warm or damp weather; and scrape off 
with a knife, or wipe away with a dry cloth, any moisture which 
may appear on the surface : when this has been done, dust some 
powdered ginger or pepper over it Unless the joint should be 
very lar^ its appearance will be improved by taking off the 
ends of the bones, which may then be laid in salt for aSwdajs, 
and afterwards boiled. Spit the beef firmly; keep it fiir back 
from the fire until it is well heated through ; baste it constantly; 
and proceed as directed in the general rules for roasting (see 
page 155). Persons who object to meat li^Dg frothed for table,

We it dredjg^ed with flour when it is first placed at the fire, and 
sprinkled with fine salt when it is nearly done. It is not neoes* 
niy to paper the fat of heeSt as many cooks direct, if proper 
attentian be given to it while roasting. 

As a general rule, it may he ohserved, that when the steam 
fitnn the meat draws strongly towards the firel, it is nearly or 
quite ready to serve. The tune required to roast it wiU depen4 
on the state of the weather,* the size and strength of the fire, 
the iMckness of the joint, the use or non-use of a meat-screen 
or reflector, the general temperature of the kitchen, and other 
contiDgendes. A quarter of an hour for each pound of meat 
is commonly alloweid for solid, heavy joints, and, if the direc- 
tions we have given be attended to, tlus will not be found too 
much even for persons who prefer beef somewhat rere : it must 
be left longer at the fire if wished very thoroughly roasted, and 
qoite doable the usual time when the plan we hAve noticed at 
page 157, is adopted. When likely to be sent to table hashed, 
minced, or dressed a second time in any way, the juices of the 
meat should be dried up as little as possible when it is first 
cooked. 

BOAST BUMP OF BBEF. 

As this Joint is generally too large to serve whole, as much of 
it as will lorm a handsome dish should be cut firom the chump 
^Qd to roast It must be managed as the sirloin, to which it is 
commonly preferred bv connoisseurs. When boned and rolled 
into the form of a fillet of veal, as it sometimes is, nearly or 
<imte an additional hour should be allowed to dress it 

TO BOAST PABT OF A BOUIO) OF BEEF, 

The natural division of the meat will show where the silver 
side of the round is to be separated firom the upper or tongue 
nde, which is the proper part for roasting, and which will be 
found equally good and profitable for the purpose, if allowed to 
bang as long as it can be kept sweet before it is dressed. Care 
shodd be taken in dividing the meat, not to pierce the inner 
skin. The silver side, with the udder, if there should be one 
to the joint, may be pickled, spiced, or simply salted, and will 
he excellent either way. The outside fiit should be drawn 
tightly round the remainder of the bee^ which must be firmly 
skewered, or bound with tape, to keep it in form. It will

kept constantly basted. 

Beef^ 14 lbs. : 4^ to 5 hours. 

06*. — We think that larding the beef quite through with 
large lardoons of film fat, of udder, or of bacon, would be an 
improvement ; and we ought also to observe, that unless it be 
young and of fine quahty , it will not answer well for roasting. 

TO BOAST A TILUBT OF BEEF. 

Baise the fillet from the inside of the sirioin, or firom part of 
it, with a sharp knife ; leave the fat on, trim off the skin, lard 
it through, or all over, or roast it, quite plain ; baste it with 
butter, and send it very hot to table, with tomata sauce, or sauce 
piquante, or eschalot sauce, in a tureen. It is sometimes served 
with brown gravy or currant jelly : it should then be garnished 
with forcemeat-balls, made as for hare. K not very large, an 
hour and a quarter will roast it well with a brisk fire. 

Obs. — The remainder of the joint may be boned, rolled, and 
roasted, or braised; or made into meat cakes; or served as a 
miniature round of beef. 

1 hour, 15 minutes. 

BOAST BEEF STEAK. 

If extremely tender, a large slice from the middle of the 
rump will make an excellent small dish of roast meat, when a 
joint is not easily to be procured. Let it be smoothly cut, from 
an inch to an inch and a half thick, flattened on a table, and 
the inside sprinkled with a little fine salt and cayenne, or com- 
mon pepper. Make a roll of forcemeat, as No. 1 (page 143), 
adding, at pleasure, a flavouring of minced onion or eschalot, 
and increasing the quantity of spices; place this on one end of 
the steak, and roll it up tightly in it; skewer and bind the meat 
so that the forcemeat cannot escape, fasten a buttered paper 
over it, and roast it an hour and a half, or more, accordmg to 
its size. Twenty minutes before it is served, take off the paper, 
and flour the meat, which ^ould be kept well basted with but« 
ter all the time it is roasting. Send brown gravy to table with 
it, and pour a Uttle over the beef. 

H hour, or more. 

TO BBOIL BEEF STEALS. 

The steaks should be from half to three quarters of an inch 
thick, equally sliced, and freshly cut from the middle of a well 
kept, finely grained, and tender rump of beef. They should be 



CHAP, vni.] BEEF. 173 

neatly trimmed, and once or twice divided, if very large. The 
fire, as we have already said in the general directions for hroil- 
ing (page 160), must be strong and clear. The bars of the 
gdiiron should be thin, and not very close together. When 
they are thoroughly heated, without being sufficiently burning 
to scorch the meat, wipe and rub them wiu fresh mutton suet ; 
next pepper the steaks slightly, but never season them with 
salt before they are dressed ; lay them on the ^diron, and 
when done on one side, turn them on the other, bemg careftd to 
cateh, in the dish in which they are to be sent to table, any 
gravy which may threaten to drain from them when they are 
moved. Let them be served the instant they are taken from the 
file; and have ready at the moment, dish, cover, and plates, as 
hot as they can be. From eight to ten minutes will be sufficient 
to broil steaks for the generality of eaters, and more than 
enough for those who like them but partially done. 

Genuine amateurs seldom take prepared sauce or gravy with 
their steaks, as they consider the natujral juices of the meat suf- 
ficient When any accompanim^it to them is desired, a small 
quantity of choice mushroom catsup may be warmed in the dish 
that is heated to receive them ; and which, when the not very 
refined flavour of a raw eschalot is liked, as it is by some eaters, 
may previously be rubbed with one, of which the large end has 
hem cut off. A thin slice or two of fresh butter is sometimes 
laid under the steaks, where it soon melts and mingles with the 
gravy which flows from them. The appropriate tureen sauces 
for broiled beef steaks are onion, tomata, oyster, eschalot, hot 
horseradish, and brown cucumber, or mushroom sauce. 

Obs. 1. — We have departed a little in this receipt from our 
previous instructions for broiling, by recommending that the 
steab should be turned but once, instead of ^* often," as all 
great authorities on the subject direct. By tiring each method, 
our readers will be able to decide for themselves upon the pre- 
ferable one : we can. only say, that we have never eaten steaks 
BO excellent as those which have been dressed exactly ia accord- 
ance with the receipt we have just given, and we have taken 
infinite pains to ascertain the really best mode of preparing 
this very fiivourite English dish, which so constantly makes its 
appearance both carelessly cooked and ill served, especially at 
private tables. 

Obs. 1. — It is a good plan to throw a few bits of charcoal on 
tbe fire some minutes before the steaks are laid down, as they 
give forth a strong heat without any smoke. 

The upright gridirons, by which meat is rather toasted than

The inside of the orloin freed from skin, and cut eyenly into 
round quarter-inch slices, should properly be used for these ; but 
when it cannot be obtained, part of the rump must be substitated 
for it. Season the steaks with fine salt and pepper, brush them 
with a little clarified butter, and boil them oyer a clear, brisk 
fire. Mix a teaspoonful of parsley, minced extremely fine, with 
a large slice of fresh butter, a little cayenne, and a small quan- 
tity of salt. When the steaks are done, put the mixture into the 
dim intended for them, and lay them upon it; garnish them 
plentifiilly with fried potatoes. It is an improyement to squeeze 
the juice of half a lemon on the butter, before the meat is heaped 
oyer it. The potatoes should be sliced rather thin, coloured of 
a fine brown, and placed eyenly round the meat

the meat; and the quantity is considerablj increased. Eschalots 
mj be used inst^d, where their strong flavour is approved. 
A ^button-mushrooms, stewed from twenty to thirty minutes 
vith the meat, will render ike catsup unnecessaiy. Wine, or

TRIED BEEF STEAK. 

We have little to add here to the directions of pa£;e 162, which 
are sufficient to enable the cook to send a dish of fried steals 
to table properly dressed. Gurrie sauce, highly onioned^ is fre- 
quently served with them. 

BEEF STEAK STEWED IN ITS OWN GBAVT. 

(fiood and wholesome,) 

Trim all the fat and skin from a rump steak of nearly an 
inch thick, and divide it once 6t twice ; just dip it into cold 
^ter, let it drain for an instant, sprinkle it on both sides with 
pepper, and then flour it rather thickly ;• lay it quite flat into a 
well-tinned iron saucepan or stewpan, which has been rinsed 
with cold water, of which a tablespoonful should be left in it. 
Place it over (not upon) a very gentle fire, and keep it just sim- 
mering from an hour and a haJf to an hour and three quarters, 
when, if the meat be good, it will have become perfectly tender. 
Add salt to it when it first begins to boil, and turn it when 
rather more than half done. A couple of 'spoonsful of gravy, 
Uas much catsup, and a slight seasoning of spice, would, to 
many tastes, improve this dish, of which, nowever, the great 
Kconmiendation is its wholesome simplicity, which renders it 
soitable to the most delicate stomach. A thick mutton cutlet 
^m the middle of the leg is excellent dressed thus.

BEEF OB MUTTON CAKE. 

{Very good,) 

Chop two pounds of lean and very tender beef or mutton, 
^h three quarters of a pound of beef suet; mix them well, 
and season them with a dessertspoonful of salt, nearly as much 
pounded cloves, a teaspoonful of pounded mace, and half a tea- 
8|)oonftil of cayenne. Line a round baking dish with thin 
slices of fat bacon, press the meat closeljr into it, smooth the 
top, and cover it with bacon, set a plate on it with a weight, and 
^e it two hours and a quarter. Take off the bac6n, and

176 MODERN COOKEBY. [CHAP. YIII. 

serve the meat hot, with a little rich browngrayy, or set it by 
until cold, when it will be equally food. The fat of the meat 
which is iised for this dish can be diopped up with it instead 
of suet, where it is liked as well; and onion, or eschalot, shred 
fine, minced savoury herbs, grated lemon-peel, rasped baoon, 
or mushrooms cut small, may in turn be added to vaiy it in 
flavour. 

Lean beef or mutton, 2 lbs. ; suet, f lb. ; salt and cloves in 
powder, each a dessertspoonful ; mace, 1 teaspoObful ; half as 
much cayenne : baked 2^ hours. 

Obs, — A larger portion of suet or of fat will render these 
cakes lighter, but will not otherwise improve them : they maj 
be made of veal or of venison, but one-third of mutton suet or 
of fat bacon should be mixed with this last. 

GESMAN STEW. 

Cut into about three-inch squares, two pounds and a half of 
the leaner part of the veiny piece of bee^ or of any joint which 
is likely to be tender, and set it on to stew, with a pint and 
three quarters of cold broth, or water, and one large onion 
sliced. When these begin to boil, add a teaspoonful of salt, and 
a third as much of pepper, and let them simmer gently for an 
hour and a half. Have readv some voung white cabbages, 
parboiled ; press the water well from tnem, lay them in with 
the beef, and let the whole stew for another hour. More 
onions, and a seascming of mixed spices, or a few bits of lean 
bacon, or of ham, can be added to this stew when a higher 
flavour is desired ; but it is very good without. 

Beef, 2^ lbs. ; water, or broth. If pint ; onion, 1 ; salt, 1 tea- 
spoonful ; third as much pepper : 1) nour. Parboiled cabbages, 
3 or 4 : 1 hour. 

WELSH STEW. 

Take the same proportions of beel^ and of broth or water, as for 
the German Stew. When they have simmered gently for an 
hour, add the white part of from twenty to thirty leeks, or two 
dozens of button onions, and five or six young nuld turnips, cut 
in slices, a small lump of white sugar, nearly half a teaspoonful 
of white pepper, and more than twice as much salt. Stew the 
whole sonly from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half^ 
after the vegetables are added. 

Beef and water as above : 1 hour. Leeks, 20 to 30 ; or 
small onions, 24 ; young turpips, 6 ; small lump of sugar ; vrhite

A GOOD EHGIJSH 8TBW. 

On three pounds of tender romp of beef^ freed £rom skin and 
&t, and cat down into about two-inch sqnarea, pour rather more 
than a quart of cold broth or gravy. When it boils add salt if 
required, and a little cayenne, and Keep it just simmerinff for a 
couple of hours ; then put to it the ffrated rmd of a lai^ lemon, 
or of two small ones, and half an hour after, stir to it a table- 
flpoonfid of rice-flour, smoothly mixed with a wineglassful of 
ffliishroom catsup, a dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, and a tea- 
fipoonfol of soy : in fifteen minutes it will be ready to senre. 
A glass and a half of port, or of white wine, will greatly improve^ 
this stew, which may likewise be flavoured with the store-sauce 
of page 136, or with another, which we find excellent for the 
purpose, made with half a pint of port wine, the same of mush- 
room-catsup, a quarter-pint of walnut-pickle, a tablespoonfiil of 
the best soy, and a dessertspoonful of cayenne-vinegar, all well 
shaken together and poured into a bottle containing the thin 
rind of a lemon and two fine mellow anchovies, of moderate size. 
A few delicately fried forcemeat-balls may be slipped into it 
aft€r it is dished. 

Obs.—The limits of our work will not permit us to devote a 
^her space to this class of dishes, but an intelligent cook will 
find it easy to yary them in numberless ways. Mushrooms, 
celeiy, carrots, sweet herbs, parboiled new potatoes, green peas, 
rice, and currie-powder may be advantageously usea for that 
purpose. Oxtails, just blanched and cut into joints, will be 
found excellent substitutes for the beef: mutton and veal also 
^y be dressed in the same way. The meat and v^etables can 
he browned before broth or water is poured to them; but, 
though perhaps more savoury, the stew will then be much less 
delicate. Each kind of vegetable should be allowed something 
more than sufficient time to render it perfectly tender, but not 
to much as would reduce it to pulp. 

TO STEW SHIN OF BEEP. 

Wash, and set it on to stew in sufficient cold water to keep it just 
covered until it is done. When it boils, take off the scum, and put 
an ounce and a quarter of salt to the gallon of water. It is usual to 
add a few cloves and some black pepper, slightly bruised and tied 
up loosely in a fold of muslin, two or more onions,^ root of celery, 
a bunch of savoury herbs, four or five carrots, and as many 



178 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAF. Till. 

turnips, either whole or sliced : if to he served with the meat, 
the last two will require a little more than the ordinary time of 
boiling, but otherwise they may be simmered with the meat 
iVom the beginnmg. Give the beef firom four to five hours' 
gentle stewing ; and serve it with part of its own liqnor thick- 
ened and flavoured, or quite plain. An excellent dish for a 
family may be made by stewmg the thick fleshy part of the 
shin or leg, in stock made of the knuckle, with a few bits of 
lean ham, or a slice of hung beef from which the smoked edges 
have been carefully pared away, and some spice, salt, and vege- 
tables : by frying these last before they are thrown into the soup- 
pot the savour of the stew will be greatly heightened ; and a 
ttireen of good soup may be made of its remams, after it has 
been served at table. 

Ox-chfeek, after having been soaked for four or five hours, 
and washed with great nicety, may be dressed like the shin; but 
as it has little flavour, the gravy should be strained, and quite 
cleared from fat, then put mto a clean saucepan, and thickened 
as soon as it boils, with the following mixture : — three dessert- 
spoonsful of rice-flour, nearly a wineglassful of catsup, a tea- 
spoonful of currie-powder, or a little powdered ginger and 
cayenne. When these have stewed for ten minut^ dish the 
head, pour the sauce over, and serve it. 

Shin of beef, 4 to 5 hours. Ox-cheek, 2 to 3 hours. 

FRENCH B££F A LA MODE. 

{A common Receipt.^ 

Take seven or eight pounds of a rump of beef (or of any 
other tender joint), free from bone, and skewer it firmly into a 
good shape. Put two ounces of butter into a thick saucepan or 
stewpan, and when it boils stir to it a tablespoonful of flour ; keep 
these well shaken over a gentle fire imtil thej^ are of a fine 
amber colour ; then lay in the beef, and brown it on both sides, 
taking care that it shall not stick to the pan. Four to it by 
slow degrees, letting each portion boil before the next is added, 
or the butter will £>at upon the surface and be difficult to clear 
off afterwards, three quarters of a pint of hot water, or gravy; 
add a bunch of savoury herbs, one large or two small carrots 
cut in thick slices, two or three moderate-sized onions, two bay- 
leaves, and sufficient pepper and salt to season the gravy.. Let 
the meat simmer gently from four to five hours, and turn it 
when it is half done. When ready to serve, lift the beef into a 
hot dish, lay the vegetables round, and pour the gravy over it, 
after having taken out the herbs and skimmed away the fat. 



OUF, Vlir.] BEEF. 179 

Id France, half or the whole of a calf s foot is stewed with the 
bee( which is there generally larded through with thick striiM 
of &t bacon. (For fording, see pi^ 166.) Veal dressed in this 
way is even hetter than lieef. The stewpan used for either 
should be as nearly of the size of the meat as possible. 
Bed, 7 to 8 lbs. : 4 to 5 hours. 

STEWED SIELOnr OP BEEF. 

As a matter of conyenienoe we have occasionally had this 
joint stewed instead of roasted, and have found it excellent. 
Cut oat the inside or fillet as entire as possible, and reserve it 
for a separate dish ; then remove the bones with care, or let the 
batcher do this for you ; spread the meat flat on a table and 
cover the inside with thm slices of striped bacon, after having 
first strewed over it a mixed seasoning of a small teaspoonful of 
salt, balf as much mace or nutmeg, and a moderate q uantity of 
pepper or cayenne. Roll and bind the meat firmly, lay it mto 
a stewpan or thick iron saucepan nearly of its size, and add the 
bones and as much good beef broth as will nearly cover the 
joint. Should this not be at hand, put a few slices of lean ham 
or bacon under the beef, and lay round it three pounds of neck 
or knuckle of veal, or of stewing beef, divided into several 
P&rts; then pour to it cold water instead of broth. In either 
case, 80 soon as it has boiled a few minutes and been well 
cleaned firom scum, throw in a larse faggot of savoury herbs, 
three or four carrots, as many leeks, or a large onion, stuck 
^tb a dozen cloves ; and, an hour later, two blades of mace, 
and half a teaspoonfal of peppercorns. Stew the beef very 
$ently indeed from four to five hours, and longer, should the 
joint be large : serve it with a good Espagnole, sauce piquante, 
or brown caper sauce. Add what salt may be needed before 
the vegetables are thrown in ; and, after the meat is lifted out, 
boil down to soup or gravy the liquor in which it has been 
stewed. To many tastes it would be an improvement to flour 
and brown the outside of the beef in butter before the broth or 
water is poiured to it : it may also be stewed (but somewhat 
longer) half-covered with rich gravy, and turned when partially 
done. Minced eschalots may l^ strewed over the inside before 
it is rolled, when their strong savour is relished, or veal force- 
meat may supply their place. 

TO STEW A BUMP OP BEEF. 

This joint is more easily carved, and is of better appearance 
^hen the bones are removed before it is dressed. Boll and 



180 MODERN COOKERT. [CHAP. Tni. 

bind it firmly, cover it with strong cold b^f broth or gravji 
and stew it very gently indeed from six hours to between seven 
and eight ; add to it, after the scum has been well cleared off, 
one large or two moderate-sized onions stuck with thirtv doves, 
a head of celery, two carrots, two turnips, and a large laggot of 
savoury herbs. When the beef is perfectly tender quite through, 
which may be known by probing it with a sharp thin skewer, 
remove the fillets of tape, dish it neatly, and serve it with a rich 
Espagnole, and a garnish of forced tomatas, or with a highly 
flavoured brown English gravy, and fstewed carrots in the dish : 
for these last the miM preparation of garlic or eschalots, of page 
122, may be substituted with good effect ; they should be well 
drained, laid roimd the meat, and a little brown gravy poured 
over the whole. 

This is the most simple and economical manner of stewing 
the beef; but should a richer one be desired, half roast the 
joint, and stew it afterwards in strong gravy, to which a pnt of 
mushrooms, and a pint of sherry or Madeira, should be added 
an hour before it is ready for table. Keep it hot while a por- 
tion of the gravy is thickened with a well-made brown ronx 
(see Chapter IV., page 96), and seasoned with salt, cayenne, 
and any other spice it may require. Garnish it with large balls 
of forcemeat, highly seasoned with minced eschalots, rolled in 
egg and bread-crumbs, 'and fried a ^e golden brown. 

Plainly stewed from 6 to 7 or 8 hours. Or : half roasted, 
then s'ewed from 4 to 5 hours. 

066'.— Grated horse-radish, mixed with some well-thickened 
brown gravy, a teaspoonful of mustard, and a little lemon-juioe 
or vinegar, is a good sauce fur stewed beef. 

BEEF PALATES. (eNTB^IE.) 

First rub them well with salt, to take off the slime ; then 
wash them thoroughly in several waters, and leave them to 
soak for half an hour before they are dre^ed. Set them over 
the fire in cold water, and boil them gently until the skin i?iU 
peel off, and the palates are tolerably tender. It is difficult to 
state the exact time required for this, as some will be done 
enough in two hours and a hall^ and others in not less than 
from four to five hours. When thus prepared, the palates may 
be cut into various forms, and simmered imtU fit to serve, in 
rich brown gravy, highly flavoured with ham, cayenne, wine, 
and lemon-peel; or they will make an excellent currie As 
they are very insipid of themselves, they require a sauce of 
jsonie piquancy, in which, after they have been peeled and 



CHiP. yill.3 BEEF. 181 

tiimmed, they should he stewed firom twenl^ to thirty minuteai 
or until they are perfectly tender. The hlack parts of them 
must he cut away, when the skin is taken off. Aii onion, stuck 
vith a few cloves, a carrot sliced, a teaspoonful of whole white 
pepper, a slice of hutter, and a teaspoonM of salt, may he 
tx)iled with the palates in the first instance ; and they will he 
found very good, if sent to tahle in the curried gravy or Chapter 
XIY., or m the Souhise of Chapter IV., made thinner than the 
leodpts direct. 

Boiled from 2| to 4 or 5 hours. Stewed firom 20 to 30 
minutes. 

Obs. — A French cook of some cdehrity, orders the palates to 
be laid on the gridiron until the skin will peel or scrape off: 
the plan seems a good one, hut we have not tried it. 

BEEF PAULTES. 

(^Neapolitan Mode.) 

Boil the palates until tiie skin can. he easily removed, then 
stew them very tender in good veal hroth, lay them on a 
drainer and let them cool ; cut them across ohhquely into strips 
of about a quarter-inch in width, and finish them hy either of 
the receipts for dressing maccaroni, which will he foimd in 
Chapters XIV. and XVIII. 

STEWED OX-TAIL8. 

They should he sent firom the hutcher ready jointed. Soak 
and wash them well, cut them into joints, or into lengths of 
two or three joints, and cover them with cold hroth or water. 
As soon as they hoil, remove the scum, and add a half-tea- 
spoonfid of salt, or as much more as may he needed, and a little 
common pepper, or cayenne, an onion stuck with half a dozen 
cloves, two or three small carrots, and a hunch or two of parsley. 
When these have simmered for two hours and a quarter, try the 
meat with a fork, and should it not he perfect^ tender, let it 
remain over the fire until it is so. Ox-tails sometimes require 
nearly oj quite three hours* stewing : they may he served with 
the vegetables, or with the gravy stramed from them, and 
thickened like the English stew, of page 177. 

Ox-tails, 2 ; water or broth to cover them ; salt, | teaspoon^, 
or more ; little pepper or cayenne ; onion, 1 ; cloves, 6 ; carrots, 
2 or 3 ; parsley, 2 or 3 branches : 2^ to 3 hours. 

BROILED OX-TAIL. (eNTB^E.) 

• {Very good.) 
When the ox-tail is ready for the stewpan, throw it into 



182 MODERN COOKBRT. [CHAP. Yin. 

plenty of boiling water, slightly salted, and simmer it for fifteen 
minutes, then take it up, and put it into fresh water to cool; 
wipe it, and lay it round in a small stewpan without dividing it; 
just cover it with ffood beef gravy, and stew it gently until very 
tender; drain it a little, sprinkle over it a small quantity of salt 
and cayenne ; dip it into clarified butter, and tnen into some 
fine bread-crumbs, with which it should be thickly covered ; lay 
it on the gridiron, and when equally browned all over serve it 
immediately. If more convenient, the ox-tail may be set into 
the oven, or before the fire, until properly coloured : it may 
likewise be sent to table without broiling, dished upon stewed 
cabbage, or in its own gravy thickened, and with tomata sauce^ 
in a tureen. 

TO SALT AKB PICKLE BEEF, IN YABIOUS WATS. 

Let the meat hang a couple of days in mild weather, and 
four or five in winter, before it is salted or pickled. During the 
heat of summer it is better to immerse it entirely in brme, 
that it may be secured alike from the flies, and from the danger 
of becoming putrid. Trim it, and take out the kernels from the 
fat ; then rub a little fine drv salt over it, and leave it until the 
following day ; drain it well from, the blood, which will be found 
to have flowed from it, and it will be ready for any of the 
following modes of curing, which are all excellent of their kind, 
'and have been well proved. 

In very cold weather, the salt may be applied quite warm to 
the meat : it should always be perfectly dry, and reduced to 
powder. 

Saltpetre hardens and renders meat indigestible ; sugar, on 
the contraiy, mellows and improves it mudi ; and it is more 
tender when cured with bay salt than when common salt is used 
for it. 

TO SALT AND BOIL A BOimD OP BEEP. 

Mix an ounce of saltpetre, finely powdered, with half a pound 
of very coarse sugar, and rub the beef thoroughly with them; 
in two days add three quarters of a pound of common salt, well 
dried and beaten ; turn and rub the meat well in every part 
with the pickle for three weeks, when it will be fit to dress. 
Just wash ofi^ the salt, and skewer the beef as round and as even 
as possible ; bind it tightly with broad tape, cover it with cold 
water, and let it simmer gently for at least five hours. Carrots, 
mashed turnips, or cabl^es, are usually served with boiled 
beef; and horse-radish stewed for ten minutes in equal parts of 



CHAP. YtnJ] BBEF. 188

with some rich melted butter, is a good sauce for it 

Bee^ 20 Ibsi. ; coarse sugar, ^ lb. ; saltpetre, 1 oz.' : 2 days. 
Salt, i lb. : 21 days. Boil 5 hours, or more. 

Obs, — ^Beef cured by this receipt, if properly boiled, is tender, 
of good colour and flavour, and not over salt. The rump, edge- 
bone, and brisket may be salted, or pickled in the same way as 
the round. 

HAMBUBOH PICKJUB TOE BEEF, HAMS, AND TONGUE. 

Boil together, for twenty minutes, two gallons of water, three 
pounds of bay salt, two pounds of coarse sugar, two ounces of 
saltpetre, and two of black pepper, bruised, and tied in a fold of 
muslin; clear off the scum thoroughly, as it rises, pour the 
pickle into a deep earthen-pan, and when it is quite cold lay in 
the meat, of which every part must be perfectly covered with it. 
A moderate-sized round of beef will be ready for table in a fort- 
night; it should be turned occasionally in the brine. Five 
pomids of common salt may be substituted for the quantity of 
bay salt given above; but the meat will not be so finelv 
flavoured. 

Water, 2 gallons ; bav-salt, 3 lbs. ; saltpetre, 2 ozs. ; black 
pepper, 2 ozs. ; sugar, 2 lbs. : 20 minutes. 

AIYOTHER PICKIE FOB TONGUES, BEEF, AND HAMS. 

To three gallons of spring water add six pounds of common 
salt, two pounds of bay-salt, two pounds of common loaf sugar, 
and two ounces of saltpetre. Boil these over a gentle fire, and 
be careful to take off all the scimi as it rises: when quite cold 
it will be fit for use. Rub the meat to be cured, with fine salt, 
and let it drain for a day or two, in order to free it from the 
blood; then immerse it in the brine, taking care that every part 
of it shall be covered. Young pork should not remain more 
than from three to five days in the pickle ; but hams for drying 
may be left in it for a fortnight at least : tongues will be ready 
m rather less time. Beef may remain from one week to two, 
according to its size, and the degree of saltness desired for it. 
A little experience will soon teach the exact time reqtured for 
the different kinds of meat. When the pickle has been in use 
for about three months, boil it up again gently, and take the 
scnm carefiilly off. Add to it three pounds of common salt, 
four ounces oi sugar, and one of saltpetre : it will remain good 
for a year or more.

quantity of coarse sugar ; rub the meat with them in eveiy part, 
and let it remain for two days^ then add one poimd of bay salt, 
four ounces of common salt, and one ounce of ground black

four days j^ur over it a pound of treade ; rub and turn it daily 
for a fortmght ; drain, and send it to be smoked. When wanted 
for table, lay it into plentyof cold water, boil it very slowly, and 
press it under a heavy weight while hot. A slice of this beef, 
from which the edges have been careftilly trimmed, will serve 
to flavour soups or gravies as well as ham.

portion as for spiced beef. 

COLLARED BEEF. 

Only the thinnest part of the flank, or the ribs, which are not 
80 generally used .fbr it, will serve conveniently for collaring. 
The first of these should be hung in a damp place for a day or 
two, to soften the outer skin ; then rubbed with coarse sugar, 
and left for a couple of days ; when, for eight pounds of the 
meat, one ounce of saltpetre and half a pound of salt should be 
added. In ten days it will be fit to dress. The bones and 
tou^h inner skin must be removed, and the beef sprinkled 
thickly on the under side with parsley and other savoury herbs 
shred small, before it is rolled, which should be done very 
tightly: it must then be secured with a cloth, and boond as 
closely as possible with broad tape. It will require nearly or 

Suite five hours of gentle boUing, and should be placed while 
ot under a weight, or in a press, without having the tape and 
cloth removed.

A COMMON BEGEIPT FOB SALTING BEEF. 

One ounce of saltpetre, and a pound of common salt, will be 
roffident for sixteen pounds of beef. Both should be well dried, 
and finely powdered ; the saltpetre rubbed first equally over the 
meat, and the salt next apphed in everv part. It should be 
rubbed thoroughly with the pickle ana turned daily, from a 
week to ten days. An ounce or two of sugar mixed with the 
saltpetre will render the beef more tender and palatable. 

Bed, 16 lbs. ; saltpetre, 1 oz. ; salt, 1 lb. : 7 to 10 days. 

SPICED BOUND OF BEEF. 

(Very highly flavoured,) 

Rub the beef well in every part with half a pound of coarse 
brown sugar, and let it remain two days; then reduce to powder, 
and mix thoroughly before they are applied to the meat, two 
ounces of saltpetre, three quarters of a pound of common salt, a 
quaiiter-pound of black pepper, three ounces of allspice, arid 
four of bruised juniper-berries. Rub these ingredients strondy 
and equally over the joint, and do so daily for three weeTcs, 
turning it at the same tune. Just wash off the spice, and put 
the beef into a tin, or covered earthen pan as nearly of its size 
as possible, with a cup of water or gravy ; cover the top thickly 
with chopped beef-suet, and lay a coarse thick crust over the pan; 
place the cover on it, and bake the meat from five tu six hours

fierce to harden the outside of the joint, which, if properly 
managed, will he exceedingly tender. Let it cool in the pan ;

Obs, — We have not ourselves tested this recemt, but the 
meat cured by it has received such high commendations from 
several of our friends who have partaken of it j&equently, that 
we think we may safely insert it without. The proportion of 
allspice appears to us more than would be agreeable to many 
taste^, and we would rather recommend that part of it should be 
omitted,' and that a portion of nutmeg, mace, and cloves should 
be substituted for it ; as we have found these spices to answer 
well in the following receipt. 

SPICED BEEF. 

(Good and wholesome,) 

For twelve pounds of the round, rump, or thick flank of 
beef, take a large teaspoonful of freshly-pounded mace, and of 
ground black pepper, twice as much of cloves, one small nut- 
meg, and a quarter teaspoouM of cayenne, all in the finest 
powder. Mix them well with seven ounces of brown sugar, rub 
the beef with them and let it He three days ; add to it then half 
a pound of fine salt, and rub and turn it once in twenty-four 
hour& for twelve days. Just wash, but do not soak it ; skewer, 
or bind it into good form, put it into a stewpan or saucepan 
nearly, of its size, pour to it a pint and a half of good beef 
broth, and when it begins to boil, take off the scimi, and throw 
in one small onion, a moderate-sized faggot of thvme and 
parsley, and two large, or four small carrots. Let it simmer 
quite softly for four hours and a half, and if not wanted to 
serve hot, leave it in its own liquor until it is nearly cold. This 
is an excellent and far more wholesome dish than the hard, 
bright-coloured beef which is cured with lar^ quantities of salt 
and saltpetre : two or three oimces of jnmper-berries may be 
added to it with the sfHce, to heighten its flavour. 

Beef, 12 lbs. ; sugar, 7 ozs. ; mace and black pepper, each, I

CHAP. Vm.] BEEF. 187 

Obs, — ^We give this receipt exactly as we have often had it 
used, but celery and turnips might be added to the gravy ; and 
when the appearance of the meat is much considered, three- 
qmirters of aa ounce of saltpetre may be mixed with the-spices ; 
the beef may also be plaiiuy boiled in water only, vdth a few 
vegetables, or baked in a deep pan with a little gravy. !No 
meat must ever be left to cool m the stewpan or saucepan in 
which it is cooked ; it must be lifted into a pan of its own depth, 
and the liquor poured upon it. 

A MINIATURE ROUITD OF BEEF. 

^ Select a fine rib of beef, and have it cut small or large in 
width, according to your taste ; it may thus be made to weigh 
from five to twelve pounds, or more. Take out the bone, and 
wrap the meat round like a fillet of veal, securing it with two 
or tnree wooden skewers ; place it in a strong pickle for four or 
five days, and then cook it, taking care that it does not boil, but 
only simmers from forty minutes, or more, according to its size. 
It is best to put it on in hot water, as it will not draw (he grav^ 
80 much as cold. Many persons adjust a, rib of beef in this 
way for roasting : let them try it salted, and they need not envy 
the possessor of the finest round of beef." We give the receipt 
to our readers in its original form, and we can assure them, from 
our own experience, that it is a good one ; but we would recom- 
mend that, in dressing the meat, quite the usual time for each 
pound of it should be allowed. When boned and rolled at the 
butcher's, the skewers should be removed when it is first 
brought in ; it should be well wiped with a dry cloth, or washed 
with a little fresh brine, and a small quantity of salt and salt- 
petre should be rubbed over the inside ; it may then be firmly 
bound with tape, and will be quite ready to boil when taken 
from the pickle. The sirloin, after the inside fillet is removed, 
may be cured and dressed in the same way, and will be found 
super-excelleut, if the beef be well fatted and properly kept. 
The Hamburg pickle (see page 183,) is perhaps the best for 
these joints, rart of the rump, taken clear of bone, answers 
admirably when prepared by this receipt. 

STUFATO. 

{A Neapolitan Receipt) 

''Take about six pounds of the silver side of the round, and 
naake several deep incisions in the inside, nearly through to the 
skin; stuff these with all kinds of savoury herbs, a good slice 
of lean ham, and half a small clove of garuc, all finely minced. 



188 MOPEBN COOKERY. (^OHAP. Till* 

and well mingled together ; then bind and tie the meat doaely 
round, so that the stuffing may not escape. Put four pounds of 
butter into a stewpan sufficiently larce to contain something 
more than that quantity, and the beef in addition ; so soon as 
it boils lay in the meat, let it just simmer for five or six hours, 
and turn it every half hour at least, that it may be equally 
done. Boil for twenty-five minutes three pounds of pipe mac- 
caroni, drain it perfectly dry, and mix it with the gravy of the 
beef^ without the butter, half a pint of very pure salad oil, and 
a pot of paste tomatas; mix these to amalgamation, without 
breaking the maccaroni ; before serving up, sprinkle Parmesan 
cheese thickly on the maccaroni." 

We insert this receipt exactly as it was eiven to us by a 
fiiend, at whose table the dish was served with great success to 
pome Italian diplomatists. From our own slight experience of 
it, we should suppose that the excellence of tne beef is quite a 
secondary consideration, as all its juices are drawn out by the 
mode of cooking, and appropriated to the maccaroni, of which 
we must observe that three pounds would make too gigeantic a 
dish to enter well, on ordinary occasions, into an English service. 

We have somewhere seen directions for making the stufato 
with the upper part of the sirloin, thickly larded with large, 
well-seasoned lardoons of bacon, and then stewed in equal pturts 
of rich gravy, and of red or of white wine. 

BEEF BOLL, OB, CANELLON BE BCEUF. (eNTBI^.) 

Chop and mix thoroughly two pounds of lean and veiy 
tender bee^ with one pound of slightly striped bacon ; season 
them with a large teaspoonfal of pepper, a little salt, a small 
nutmeg, or two thirds as much of mace, the grated rind of a 
lemon, or a teaspoonful of thyme and parsley finely minced. 
Form the whole mto a thick rouleau, wrap a buttered paper 
round it, enclose it in a paste made of flour and water, and send 
it to a moderate oven for a couple of hours. Remove the paper 
and the crust, and serve the meat with a little brown gravr* 
Lamb and veal are excellent dressed in this way, particularly 
when mixed with plenty of mushrooms. Brown cucumber 
sauce should be served with the lamb ; and currie, or oyster 
sauce, when there are no mushrooms, with the veal. A flavour- 
ing of onion or of eschalot, where it is liked, can be added at 
pleasure to the beef: suet, or the fat of the meat, may be sab- 
stituted for the bacon.

MINCED COLLOP8 AIT NATUSEL. 

Mince finelj a pound of very tender undress^ beef, free 
fiom fat or skin ; season it with a moderate quantity of pepper 
and salt, set it oyer a gentle fire, and keep it stirred with a fork 
nntil it is quite hot, that it may not gather into Imnps. Simmer 
it veiy slowly in its own gravr from ten to twelve minutes, and 
then, should it be too dty, add a little boiling water, broth, or 
gravy ; stew it two minutes longer, and serve it directly. 

Tnese collms are particulany suited to persons in delicate 
health, or or weak digestion ; and when an extra dish is 
required at a short notice, from the expedition with which they 
niay be dressed, they are a convenient resource. 

10 to 12 minutes. 

SAVOUST MINCED COLLOP8. 

Make a little brown thickening (see page 96) with about an 
ounce and a half of butter, and a dessertspooniul of flour ; 
when it begms to be coloured, shake lightly into it a large 
teaspoonful of finely-shred parsley or mixed savoury herbs, 
two thirds as much of salt, and half the quantity of pepper. 
Keep these stirred over a gentle fire until the thickening is of a 
deep yellow brown ; then add a pound of rump-steak, finely 
minced, and keep it well separated with a fork until it is quite 
hot ; next pour to it gradually half a cupfiil of boiling water, 
and stew the coll(»8 very gently for ten minutes. Before they 
^^ served, stir to tnem a little catsup, Chili vinegar, or lemon- 
juice : a small quantity of minced onion, eschalot, or a particle 
of garlic, may be added at first to the thickening when the 
flavour is not objected to. 

A BICHEB VABIETY OF MINCED COLLOPS. 

Omit the minced herbs from the thickening, and season it 
with cayenne and a small quarter-teaspoonful of pounded mace. 
Substitute beef gravy for the boiling water, and when the collops 
are nearly done, fill a wineglass with one fourth of mushroom 
catsup, and three of port wine, and stir these to the meat. Serve 
the collops very hot, and garnish them with alternate forcemeat 
halls (see No. 1, page 143,) and fried sippets. If flavoured with 
a little gravy made from the bones of a roast hare, and served 
^ith currant jelly, these collops will scarcely be distinguished 
from game.

BEEF TONGUES. 

These may be cured by any of the .receipts which we have 
already given for pickling beef, or for those which will be foimd 
further on for hams and bacon. Some persons prefer them 
cured with salt and saltpetre only, and dried naturuly in a cool 
and aiiY room. For such of our readers as like them highly 
and richly flavoured we give our own method t)f having Uiem 
prepared, which is this : — " Rub over the tongue a handful of 
fine salt, and let it dram until the following day ; then, shoold 
it weigh from seven to eight pounds, mix thoroughly an ounce 
of saltpetre, two ounces of the coarsest sugar, and naLPan ounce 
of black pepper ; when the tongue has been well rubbed with 
these, add three ounces of bruised juniper-berries ; and when it 
has laid two days, eight ounces of bay salt, dried and pounded ; 
at the end of three days more, pour on it half a pound of treacle, 
and let it remain in the pickle a fortnight after this ; then hang 
it to drain, fold it in brown paper, and send it to be smoked 
over a wood fire for two or three weeks. Should the peculiar 
flavour of the juniper-berries prevail too much, or be disap- 
proved, they may be in part, or altogether, omitted ; and six 
ounces of sugar may be rubbed into the tongue in the first in- 
stance when it is liked better than treacle. 

Tongue, 7 to 8 lbs. ; saltpetre, 1 oz. ; black pepper, i oz. ; 
susar, 2 ozs. ; juniper-berries, 3 ozs. : 2 days. Bay salt, 8 ozs. : 
3 day^. Treacle, J lb. : 14 days. 

Obs, — Before the tongue is salted, the gullet, which has an 
unsightly appearance, should be trinmied away : it is indeed 
usual to take the root off entirely, but some families prefer H 
left on for the sake of the fat.

weeks. 

TO BBESS BEEF TONGUES. 

When taken fresh from the pickle they require no soaking, 
unless they should have remained in it much heyond the usual 
time, or have heen cured with a more than common proportion 
of salt ; hut when they have heen smoked and hung for some 
time, they should he laid for two or three hours in cold, and as 
much longer in tepid water, before they are dressed: if extremely 
dry, ten or twelve hours must he allowed to soften theni, and 
they should always be brought very slowly to boil. Two or 
thitse carrots and a la^ bunch of savoury herbs, added after 
the scum is cleared off, will improve 'them. They should be 
simmered imtil they are extremely tender, when tne skin will 
peel from them easily. A highly dried tongue will usually 
require from three and a half to four hours* boiling ; an un- 
smoked one about an hour less ; and for one which has not been 
salted at all a shorter time will suffice. 

BOBDTKE BECEIPT FOB STEWING A TONGUE. 

After the tongue has been soaked, trimmed, and washed with 
extreme nicety, lay it into a vessel of fitting size, and place 
round it three or four pounds of the neck, or of any other lean 
cuttings of beef, with some bones of undressed veal, and pour in 
sufficient cold water to keep it covered until it is done; or, 
instead of this, use strong imseasoned beef broth made \\ith the 
shin, and any odd bits or bones of veal which may be at hand. 
Let the tongue be brought to boil very gradually, that it may 
be plump and tender. Kemove the scum when it first rises, and 
when it is quite cleared off add a large faggot of parsley, thyme, 
and winter savoury, three carrots, a small onion, and one mild 
turnip. After three hours and a half of gentle simmering, 
probe the tongue, and if sufficiently done peel off the skin and 
serve it quickly. K not wanted hot for table, lay it on a very 
dean board or trencher,, and fasten it down to it by passing a 
carving fork through the root, and a smaller one through the 
tip, drawing the tongue straight with the latter before it is fixed 
in the board ; let it remain thus smtil quite cold. It is much 
the £)shion at present to glaze hams and tongues, but this should 
never be attempted by a cook not well acquainted with the 
nuumer of doing it, and the proper flavour and appearance of 



192 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAF. THT. 

the glaze. For directions to make it, see jmge 93. Where 
expense is not resarded, three or four ponnds of veal may be 
added to the beef in thi^ receipt, or the tongue may be stewed 
in a prepared grayy made with equal parts of beef and veal, and 
yegetables as above, but without salt : this may afterwards be 
converted into excellent soup. A fresh or an unsmoked tongue 
may be dressed in this way, but will require less time ; for the 
former, salt must be added to the gravy. 

TO BOAST A BEET HEART. 

Wash and soak the heart very thoroughly, cut away the 
lobes, fill the cavities with a veal forcemeat (No. 1, page 148), 
secure it well with a needle and twine, or very coarse thread, 
and roast it at a good fire for an hour and a hall^ keeping it 
basted plentiMly with butter. Four melted butter over it, 
after it is dished, and send.it to table as hot as possible. Many 
persons boil the heart for. three quarters of an hour before it is 
put to the fire, and this is said to render it more delicate eating; 
the time of roasting must of course be proportionately diminishei 
Good brown gravy may be substituted for the mielted batter, 
*and currant jelly dso may be served with it, 

li hour, or more. 

BEEP KIDNET. 

Slice the kidney rather thin, afler having stripped off the 
skin, and removed the fat; season it with pepper, salt, and 
grated nutmeg, and sprinkle over it plenty of minced parsley, or 
equal parts of parsley and eschalots chopped very small. Frv 
the slices over a brisk fire, and when nicely browned on both 
sides, stir amongst them a teaspoon^ of flour, and pour in by 
degrees a cup of gravy and a glass of white wine ; bring the 
sauce to the point of boiling, add a morsel of fresh butter and a 
tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and pour the whole into a hot 
dish garnished with fried bread. This is a French receipt, and 
a very excellent one.

(^A plainer way^ 

Trim, and cut the kidney into slices ; season them with salt

AN EXCEUJBNT HASH OF COLD BEEF. 

Put a slice of butter into a thick saucepan, and when it boils 
throw in a dessertspoonful of minced herbs, and an onion (or 
two or three eschalots) shred small : shake them over the fire 
until lightly browned, then stir in a tablespoonful of flour, a 
litde (Avenne, some mace or nutmeg, and half a teaspooi^ul of 
salt. When the whole is well coloured, pour to it tnree quar- 
ters of a pint or more of broth or gravy, according to the 
quantity of meat to be served in it. Let this boil gently for 
fifteen minutes ; then strain it ; add half a wineglassfuf of mush- 
room or of conmound catsup ; lay in the meat, and keep it by 
the side of the fire until it is heated through and is on tiie point 
of simmering, but be sure not to let ii bod. Put some fried or 
toasted sippets into a very hot dish, and serve the hash directly. 

A COMMON HASH OF COLD BEEF OB MXTTTON. 

Take the meat from the bones, slice it small, trim off the 
brown edges, and stew down the trimmings with the bones well 
broken, an onion, a bunch of thyme and parsley, a carrot cut 
into thick slices, a few peppercorns, four cloves, some salt^ and 
a pint and a half of water. When this is reduced to little more 
than three quarters of a pint, strain it, clear it from the fat, 
thicken it with a large dessertspoonftd of rice flour, or rather 
less of arrow-root ; add salt and pepper if needed, boil the whole 
for a few minut^ then lay in the meat and heat it well, 
fioiled potatoes are sometimes sliced hot into a very common

hash or mince be allowed to boil, it will immediately become 
hard, and can then only be rendered eatable by verv long

already sufliciently done.

moderately with salt; add, when they are liked, one or two 
eschalots, minced small, with a few chopped mushrooms, either 
ficsh or pickled, or two tablespoonsial of mushroom cat-

thick layer of bread-crumbs; moisten these plentmdly with 
clarified butter, passed through a small strainer over them, and 
send the mince to a slow oven for twenty minutes, or brown it 
in a Dutch oven. 

SAUKDEBS. 

Spread on the dish in which the saunders are to be served, a 
la^er of smoothly mashed potatoes, which have been seasoned 
^th salt and mixed with about an ounce of butter to the pound. 
On these spread equally and thickly some underdressed beef or 
mutton, nunced, and mixed with a little of the graw that has 
ran fix)m the joint, or vrith a few spoonsM of any other ; some 
salt, pepper, and a small quantity of nutmeg. Place evenly 
over this another layer of potatoes, and send the dish to the 
oven for half an hour. A very superior kind of saunders is 
made by substituting fresh meat for roasted ; but this requires 
to he balked an hour or something more. Sausage-meat, highly 
seasoned, may be served in this way, instead of beef or mutton.

made with flour and water, over the ends where the marrow is 
mhle, and tie a doth tightly over them ; take the paste off 
hefore the bones are sent to table, and serve them, placed up- 
right in a napkin, with slices of dry toasted bread, apart. When 
not wanted ror immediate use, they may be partially boiled, and

TO CHOOSE YSAL. 

Vbil should, be fat, finely grained, white, firm, and not over- 
grown : ibr when very lar^e it is apt to be coarse and tough. 
jft is more difficult to keep uum any other meat except pork, and 
should never be allowed to acquire the slightest tamt before it 
isdre8sed,as any approach to putridity renders it equaUy un- 
wholesome and offensive to the taste. The fillet, the loin, the 
shoulder, and the best end of the neck, are the parts generally 
selected for roasting ; the breast and knuckle are more usually 
stewed or boiled. The udder, or firm white fiit of the fillet, is 
much used by French cooks instead of butter, especially in the 
composition of their forcemeats : for these, it is fint well boiled,' 
then left until quite cold, and afterwards thoroughly pounded 
before it Is mixed with the other ingredients. Hie head and 
feet of the calf are valuable articles of food, both for the nu- 
triment which the gelatinous parts of them afford, and for 
. the great variety of modes in which they may be dressed. 
The kidneys, with the rich fiit that surrounds them, and the 
sweetbreads especially, are well known delicacies; the liver 
and the heart also are very good eating ; and no meat is so 
generally naefal for rich soups and gravies as veal. 

. TO TAKE THE HAIB JPBOU A CALF^S HEAD WITH THE 

SKIN ON. 

It is better to do this before the head is divided ; but if only 
the half of one with the skin on can be procured, it must be 
maDaged in the same way. Put it into plenty of water which 
is on the point of simmering, but which does not positively boil, 
and let it remain in until it does so, and for five or six minutes 
afterwards, but at the fijrst full bubble draw it from the fire and 
let it merely scald ; then lift it out, and with a knife that is not 
sharp scrape' off tiie hair as closely and as quickly as possible. 
The butchers have an instrument on purpose for the operation ; 
bat we have had the head look quite as well when done in the 
mamier we have just described, as when it has been sent in ready 
prepared by them. After the hmi is off, the head should lie 
well washed, and if it cannot be cooked the same day it must be 
^ped extremely dry before it is hung up ; and when it has not 
been divided, it should be left whole until the time approaches 
for dressing it. The brain must then be taken out, and both 
that and the Head well soaked and washed with the greatest 
nicety. When the half head only is scalded, the brain should 
first be removed. Calves* feet are freed from the hair easily in

the same manner ; indeed, we find it a better mode of haVing it 
cleared from them than the one we have giyen in Chapter £K^ 
though that is practised by many good butchers. * 

BOILED calf's HEAD. 

When the head is dressed with the skin on, which many per- 
sons prefer, the ear must be cut off quite close to it ; it will re- 
quire three quarters of an hour or upwards of additional boiling, 
and should be served covered with med crumbs: the more usual 
mode, however, is to boil it without the skin. In either case, 
first remove the brain, wash the head delicately dean, and soak 
it for a quarter of an hour ; cover it plentifully with cold water, 
remove ihe scum as it rises with great care, throw in a little salt, 
and boil the head gently until it is perfectly tender. In the 
mean time, wash and soak the brains first in cold and then in 
warm water, remove the skin or film, boil them in a small sauce- 
pan from fourteen to sixteen minutes, according to their size, 
and when they are done, chop and mix them with eight or tea 
sage leaves boiled tender, and finely minced, or, if preferred, 
with parsley boiled instead ; virarm them in a spoonfiil or two of 
melted butter, or white sauce ; skin the tongue, trim off the 
root, and serve it in a small dish ivith the brams laid round it 
Send the head to table very hot with parsley and butter poured 
over it, and some more in a tureen. A cheek of bacon, or veiy 
delicate pickled pork, and greens, are the usual accompaniments 
to boiled calfs head. 

We have given here the common English mode of serving 
this dish, by some epicures considered the best, and by others, 
as exceedingly insipid. On the Continent, tomata sauce takes 
place of the parsley and butter; and rich oyster or Dutch 
sauce, are varieties often substituted for it in this country. 

With the skin on, from 2| to 2| hours ; without the skin, 
from 1^ to If hour. 

calf's head, the WABDEB*S WAT. 

(^n excellent Receipt,^ 

Boil the half-head until tolerably tender; let it cool, and bone 
it entirely ; replace the brain, lay the head into a stewpan, and 
simmer it gently for an hour in rich gravy. From five and 
twenty to thirty minutes before it is dished, add, if procurable, 
half a pint of mushroom-buttons. Thicken the gravy, if need- 
ftd with rice-fiour, or with fiour and butter, and serve plenty 
of forcemeat-balls round the head. For dishes of this kind, a 
littie sweet-basil wine, or a few sprigs of the herb itsd^ impart 



CXAP. IX.] TEAL. 199 

t 

a very agreeable flayour. When neither these nor moshrooms 
are within reach, the very thin rind of a small but fresh lemon 
may be boiled in the gravy, and the strained juice added at the 
instant of serving. 

Boiled from 1 to 2 hours; stewed 1 hour. 

Obs, — The skin, toith the ear, may be left on the head for this 
receipt, and the latter slit into narrow strips from the tip to 
withm an inch and a half of the base ; which will give it a 
feathery and ornamental appearance : the head may then be 
glazed or not at pleasure. "* 

PSEFABED CAlf *S HEAD. 

(The Cooky's Receipt.) 

Take away the brains and tongue firom the half of a calf *s 
head, and then remove the bones, being careful in doing so to 
keep the knife as close to them as possible, and to avoid pierciiu^ 
the outer skin : in this consists the whole art of boning, m which 
an attentive cook may easily render herself expert. Kext wash 
the head and dry it in a dean cloth ; sprinkle over the inside a 
little pounded mace and cayenne, or white pepper ; roll it up 
tightly, and bind it round with tape or twine. Lay into a 
small stewpot three or four pounds of neck of veal or of beef^ 
twice or tnrice divided, and place the head upon it with the 
hones well broken ; pour in half a gallon of cold water, or as 
much as will suffice to keep the head covered until it is done, 
and sinuner it very gently firom an hour and a quarter to an 
hour and three quarters. When it is extremely tender, lift it 
oat, and if wanted for table, remove the binding, and serve it 
Teiy hot, with currie sauce, rich oyster sauce, or egg sauce and 
brown gravy ; but should the remains, or the whole of it be 
required for the following receipts, pour no gravy over it : in 
the latter case do not take off the tape for several hours. The 
tongue may be stewed with the head, but will require rather 
less thne. We do not think it needful to repeat in evenr receipt 
our dir»ctions for adding salt to, and removing caremlly the 
sciun from, meats that are stewed or boiled, but the cook must 
not neglect either. When the trouble of boning is objected to, 
it can be dispensed with for some of the dishes whicn follow, 
but not for all. After the head is taken out, boil the gravy 
until it is well reduced, and rich : it should be strongly jellied 
when cold. A bone of ham, or a slice of hung beef will much 
improve its flavour ; but v^etables must be avoided if it be 
wanted to keep : a little spice and a faggot of parsley ma^r be 
added to it, and a calf's foot will be sure to give it the requisite

BUSLIHGTON WHIM8ET. 

Set aside until quite cold half a calf *8 head dressed hy the 
preceding receipt. If, on cutting it, the gelatinous part should 
not appear perfectly tendor, pare it off closely from the head, 
weigh, and mince it ; put it into a pint of good gravy, and stew 
it gently from ten to fifteen minutes. Mince -as much more of 
the head as will make up a pound in weight after the edges are 
trimmed off, and part of the fat is taken away ; add to this three 
ounces of the lean of a hoiled ham finely chopped, the grated 
rind of a large lemon, three teaspoonsftd of parsley and one of 
thyme shred very small, three quarters of a teaspoonftil of mace, 
half a small nutm^ grated, a teaspoonful of salt, a^d a half- 
(juarter one of ca^renne ; stir the whole well together, and put 
it, with half a pint more of gravy, to the portion which oas 
been already simmered. When the whimsey nas boiled sf^Uv 
'from four to five minutes, pour it into moulos or pans, in wnico 
slices of the tongue have been evenly arranged, and when quite 
cold it will turn out very firmly. It may be garnished, before 
it is sent to table, with oranches of parsley, which should, hoW' 
ever, be perfectly diy ; and when served ror supper or luncheon, 
it mav be accompamed by salad sauce. 

Calf's head, 1 lb.; lean of ham, 3 ozs.; gravy, 1| pint; rind 
of 1 large lemon ; parsley, 3 teaspoonsful ; thyfne ana salt, each 
1 teaspoonful; mace, f teaspoonful; { nutmeg; cayenne, i psrt 
of teaspoonful : 6 minutes. 

Obs» — The remains of a plain boiled head may be made to 
serve for this dish, provided the gravy used witn it be well 
jellied and of high flavour. Slices from the small end of a 
Doiled and smoked ox-tongue, fi^om their bright colour improve 
greatly its appearance. It should be tasted before it is 
]X)ured out, that salt or any other seasoning may be added if 
nccdfal. After three or four days* keeping, should any mould 
appear upon the surface, take it oif, re-melt the whimsey, and 
give it two minutes' boil. For change, the herbs may be omitted, 
and the (quantity of ham increased, or some minced tongue sub- 
stituted lor it. 

CUTLETS OP calf's HEAD. 

Prepare, by The Cook's Receipt, half a calfs head with or 
without the skin on ; only, in the latter case, allow more time 
for the boiling. When it is quite cold, remove the fillets of tapCi 



OTAP. IX.] VEAL. 201 

and cat the head into slices of half an inch thick, brash them 
over with yolk of egg, and dip them into fine bread-crumbs, 
seasoned with the grated rind of half a lemon, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, a dessertspoonful of minced savoury herbs, some cayenne, 
and a little of the lean of a boiled ham chopped very small, 
should this last be at hand. Fry the cutlets in butter of a fine 
light brown, make some gravy in the pan as for veal cutlets, 
aiid add to it the juice of half a lemon ; or mix a large tea- 
spoonful of currie-powder, and .one of flour, very smoothly 
with the butter, shake them over the fire for four or five 
minut^ and let the gravy simmer as much lonser, after the 
water is added ; or serve the cutlets, covered with good mush- 
room sauce. 

HASHED CALF*S HEAD. 

When the whole of this dish has to be prepared, make for it 
a quart of stock, and proceed in all else as directed for mock 
turtle soup (page 23) ; but after the head has been parboiled, 
cut down a full pound and a half of it for the hash, and slice it 
small and thick, instead of dividing it into dice. Make the 
brains into cakes (see page 148), and garnish the dish with 
forcemeat-balls, rolled in egg, and in the finest bread-crumbs, 
then filed a delicate brown, and well drained, and dried upon a 
wann sieve reversed. The wine and other seasonings should be 
the same as for the soup. 

Kich gravy, 1 quart ; flesh of calTs head, full 1} lb. ; wine, 
and other seasonings, as for mock turtle soup. 

Obs. — The gravy for this hash should be stewed with ham, 
eschalots, &&, exactly as for the soup. 



CHEAP HASH OF CALF*S HEAD. 



Take the flesh from the bone of a cold boiled head, and put 
it aside until wanted ; take about three pints of the liquor in 
which it was cooked; break the bones, and stew them down 
with a small bunch of savoury herbs, a carrot, or two should 
they be small, a little carefully fried onion, four cloves, a dozen 
corns of pepper, and either a slice or two of lean unboiled ham, 
or the bone of a boiled one, quite cleared of flesh, well bruised 
and broken, and fi-eed carefully from anv of the smoked out- 
sides. If neither of these can be had, n-om half to a whole 
pound of neck of beef should be stewed with the bones, or the 
whole will be insipid in flavour. When the liquid is reduced 
nearly hal^ strain it, take off the fat, thicken it with a little 
well made roox, or, if more convenient, with flour and butter, 



202 MODERN COOKERY. [cHAP. IX. 

stirred into it, when it boils, or with rice floiir or arrow-root, 
mixed with a little spice, mushroom catsup, or Harre/s sauce, 
and a small quantity of lemon pickle or Chili yin^ar. Heat 
the meat slowly in the sauce when it is ready, but do not allow 
it to boil. The forcemeat, No, 1. of Chapter VI., may be rolled 
into balls, fried, and served round it. The gravy should be 
tpell seasoned. 

TO DRESS COLD CALF*8 HEAD OS VEAL 
)l IA MAITRE D*HOTEJL. (gOOO.) 

(English Receipt,) 

Cut into small delicate slices, or into scollops of equal size, 
sufficient cold calfs head or veal for a dish. Kezt kiic»d very 
smoothly together with a knife two ounces of butter, and a 
small dessertspoonful of flour ; put these into a stewpan or well 
tinned saucepan, and keep them stirred or shaken over a gentle 
fire imtil they have simmered fbr a minute or two, but do not 
let them take the slightest colour; then add to them in very 
small portions (letting the sauce boil up after each is poured in) 
half a pint of pale veal gravy, or of good shin-of-beef stock, and 
when tne whole is very smoothly blended, and has boiled for a 
couple of minutes, mix together and stir to it a tablespoonfiil of 
common vinegar, a dessertspoonful of Chili vinegar, a little 
cayenne, a tablespoonful of good mushroom catsup, and a very 
small bit of sugar ; and when the sauce agaiii boils, strew a 
tablespoonful of minced parsley over the meat, lay it in, and let 
it stand by the fire imtil it is quite heated through, but do not 
allow it to boil : if kept just at the simmering point for ten or 
twelve minutes it may be served perfectly hot without. The 
addition of the mushroom catsup converts this into an Englisli 
sauce, and renders it in colour, as well as in flavour, unlike the 
French one which bears the same name, and which is acidulated 
generally with lemon-juice instead of vinegar. Pickled mush- 
rooms are sometimes added to the dish : the parsley when it is 
objected to may be omitted, and the yolks of two or three eggs 
mixed with a httle cream may be stin^ in, but not allowed to 
boil, just before the meat is served. When veal is used for this 
hash instead of calTs head, it should be cut into slices not mndi 
larger than a shilling, and fireed entirely from fat, sinew, and 
the brown edges. When neither broth nor gravy is at hand, a 
morsel or two of lean ham, and a few of the trimmings or bones 
of the head or joint, may be boiled down to supply its place. 

Sufficient cold calfs head, or meat, for a dish; butter, 2 oa.;

vinegar, and mnshroom catsup, of each 1 tablespoonftil ; Chili 
Tinegar, 1 dessertspoonful ; small bit of suw ; little cayenne, 
and salt if needed; parsley, 1 tablespoonful Qiickled mushrooms

Obs, — Soles or codfish are very good, if raised neatly from the 
bones, or flaked, and heated in ^ois Mditre d*Hotel sauce. 

CALF*S HEAD BBAWN. 

{Aulhoi'a Receipt) 

The half of a fine large calf*s head, with the skin on, will 
best answer for this brawn. Take out the brains, and bone it 
entirely, or get the butcher to do this ; rub a little fine salt over, 
and let it drain for ten or twelve hours ; next wipe it diy, and rub 
it well in every part with three quarters of an ounce of saltpetre 
finely powdered (or with an ounce should the head be very 
large) and mixed with four ounces of common salt, and three of 
bay-salt, also In-^iten fine ; turn the head daily in this pickle for 
four or tve days, rubbing it a little each time ; and then pour 
over it four ounces of treacle, and continue to turn it every day, 
and baste it with the brine very frequently for a month. Hang 
it up for a night to drain, fold it in brown paper, and send it to 
be smoked where wood only is burned, firom three to four 
weeks. When wanted for table, wash and scrape it very clean, 
bat do not soak it ; lay it, with the rind downwards, into a 
saucepan or stewpan, which will hold it easily ; cover it well 
with cold water, as it will swell considerably in the cooking ; let 
it heat rather slowly, skim it thoroughly when it first b^ns to 
sinmier, and boil it as gently as possible from an hour and three 
quarters, to a couple of hours or more, should it not then be 
perfect^/ tender quite through ; for unless sufficiently boiled, the 
skm, which greatly resembles brawn, will be unpleasantly 
tough when cold. When the fleshy side of the head is done, 
which will be twenty minutes or luuf an hour sooner than the 
outside, pour the water from it, leaving so much only in the 
stewpan as will just cover the gelatinous part, and simmer it 
until this is thoroughly tender. The head thus cured is veiy 
highly flavoured, aud most excellent eating. The receipt for it is 
entirely new, having originated with ourselves. We ^ye the 
reader, in addition the result of our first experiment with it; 
which was exceedingly successful: — "A half calf's head, not 
very large, without the skin, pickled with three ounces of 
common salt, two of bay-salt, half an ounce of saltpetre, one 
ounce of brown sugar, and half an ounce of pepper, left four 
days ; then three ounces of treacle added, and the pickling con- 



204 MODERN COOKEBT. [CHAP. TX. 

tinned for a month ; smoked nearly as long, and boiled between 
one hour and a half, and two hours.** The pepper was omitted 
in our second trial, because it did not improve the appearance of 
the dish, although it was an advantage in point of flavour. 
Juniper-berries might, we think, be added with advantage, when 
thej are l^ed; and cayenne tied in a muslin might supply the 
place of the pepper. It is an infinite improvement to have the 
skin of the head left on. 

TO BOAST A FILLET OF VEAL. 

Take out the bone and put a good roll of forcemeat (No. 1, 
pa^ 143) under the flap, dividi^ first, with a shurp knife, the 
skm from the meat sufficiently to admit the quantity required ; 
secure it well, truss the vefd firmly into good snape, place 
it at a distance from the fire at first, and baste it with butter. 
The outside will have a richer crust of browning if the meat be 
washed, wiped tolerably diy, and well floured before it is laid 
to the fire. It should be carefully watched, and basted ofren, 
that the fat may not bum. Pour melted butter over it after it 
is dished, and serve with it a boiled cheek of bacon and a 
lemon. Roast it from three hours and a hal^ to four hours 
and a hal^ according to its size. 

BOILED FILLET OF VEAL. 

A small and delicately white fillet should be selected for this 
purpose. Bind it round with tape, after having washed it 
thoroughly; cover it well with cold water, and bring it gently 
to boil ; watch, and dear off carefully, the scum as it rises, and 
be, at the same time, very cautious not to allow the water to 
become smoked. Let the meat be fientfy simmered from three 
hours and a half to four and a half, according to its weight 
Send it to table with .rich white sauce, and a boiled tongue ; or 
make for it in the first instance the oyster forcemeat of Chapter 
VL, and serve with the veal a tureen of well-made oyster sauce. 

dj^ to 4^ hours. 

BOAST LOIN OF VEAL. 

It is not usual to stuff a loin of veal, but we greatly recom- 
mend the practice, as an infinite improvement to the joint 
Make the same forcemeat as for the fillet ; and insert it between 
the skin and the flesh just over the ends of the bones. Skewer 
down the flap, place the joint at a moderate distance from a 
sound fire, keep it constantly basted, and be especially aureful 
not to allow the kidney &.t to bum : to prevent this, and to

It weU with flour soon after it is laid to the fire. ^^^ ^^^ 
2 to 21 hours. 

BOILED LOIN OP YSAL. 

If dressed with care and served with good sauces, this, when 
the meat is small and white, is an excellent dish, and often more 
acceptable to persons of delicate habit than roast veal. Take 
from eight to ten pounds of the best end of the lorn, leave the 
iadnejr m with all its fat, skewer or bind down the flap, lay the 
meat mto cold water, and boil it as gentiij as possible from two 
hours and a quarter to two and a half, clearing off the scum 
perfectly, as m dressing the fillet. Send it to table with well- 
made oyster sauce, or bechamel, or with white sauce well 
flavoured with lemon-juice, and with parsley, boiled, pressed 
ory, and finely chopped. 

2^ to 2^ hours. 

STEWED IiOIN OV VEAL. • 

Take rart of a loin of veal, the chump end will do? put into 
a krge, fliick, well-tinned iron saucepan, or into a stewpan, about 
a couple of ounces of butter, and shake it over a moderate fire 
pnta it begins to brown ; flour the veal well all over, lay it 
mto the saucepan, and when it is of a fine, equal, %ht brown, 
pow gradually in veal broth, gravy, or boiling water to nearly 
half Its depth ; add a little salt, one or two sliced cwrots, a 
small onion, or more when the flavour is much liked, and a 
Donch of parsley; stew the veal very softly for an hour or 
rather more; then turn it, and let it stew for nearly or quite 
Miother hour, or longer shoujd it not appear perfectly done. 
As none of our receipts have been tried with large, coarse veal, 
the cooking must be regulated by that dreumstance, and longer 
toe allowed should the meat be of more than middling^. 
Dish the joint ; skim all the fet from the gravy, and strain it 
over the meat ; or keep the joint hot while it is rapidly reduced 
to a richer consistency. This is merely a plain fiunily stew.

be taken up when half done, and curried, or made into cutlets,

Bone a shoulder of veal, and strew the inside thickly with 
savoory herbs, minced small ; season it well with salt, cayenne, 
and ponnded mace ; and place on these a li^er of ham cut in 
thin slices, and freed from rind and rust. Koll the veal, and 
bind it tightly with a fiUet; roast it for an hour and a half, 
then siipm^r it gently in good brown gravy for five hours ; add 
forcemeat balls before it is dished ; skim the fat from the gravy, 
and serve it with the meat. This receipt, for which we are 
indebted to a correspondent on whom we can depend, and which 
we have not, therefore, proved ourselves, is for a joint which 
weighs ten pounds before it is boned. 

BOAST ITECK OF VEAL. 

The best end of the neck vnll make an excellent roast. A 
forcemeat may be inserted between the skin and the flesh, by 
first separating them with a sharp knife ; or the dish may be 
g^aniished with the forcemeat in balls. From an hour and three 
quarters to a couple of hours will roast it. Pour melted butter 
over it when it is dished, and serve it like other joints. Let 
it be floured when first laid to the fire, kept constantly basted, 
and always at a sufficient distance to prevent its being scorched. 

If to 2 hours. 

For the forcemeat, see No. 1, Chapter VI. From 8 to 10 
minutes iidll fry the balls. 

NECK OF VEAL. 

(A la Creme^ or au Bechamel.) 

Take the best end of a neck of white, and well-fed veal, 
detach the flesh from the ends of the bones, cut them sufficiently 
short to give the joint a good square form, roll and skewer the 
skin over them, vrrap a buttered paper round the meat, lay it at 
a moderate distance from a clear fire, and keep it well oasted 
with butter for an hour and a quarter ; then remove the paper 
and continue the basting with a pint, or more, of bechamel, or 
of rich white sauce, untU the veal is sufficiently roasted, and 
well encrusted with it. Serve some bechamel under it in the 
dish, and send it very hot to table. For variety, give the 
bechamel, in making it, a high flavour of mushrooms, and add

reserved for saucing the joint. 
2 to 2^ hours. 

KNUCKLE or YXAL. 

(^En Ragout.) 

Gut in small thick slices the flesh of a knuckle of veal, season 
it with a little fine salt and white pepper, flour it lightly, and 
£ry it in butter to a pale brown, lay it mto a very clean stewpan 
or saucepan, and just cover it with boiling water ; skim it dean, 
and add to it a faggot of thyme and parsley, the white part of a 
head of celery, a small quantity of cayenne, and a blade or two 
of mace. Stew it very softly from an hour and three quarters, to 
two hours and a hdli. Tmcken and enrich the gravy if needful 
with rice-flour and mushroom catsup or Harvey^ sauce, or with 
a large teaspoonM of flour, mixed with a slice of butter, a little 
good store-sauce and a glass of sherry or Madeira. Fried force- 
meat baUs of No. 1, page 143, may be added at pleasure. With 
an additional quantity of water, or of broth (made with the 
bones of the joint), a pint and a half of young green jpeas 
stewed with the veal for an hour will give an agreeable variety 
of this dish. 

BOILED KNUCKLE OF VEAL. 

After the joint* has been trimmed and well washed, put it 
into a vessel well adapted to it in size, for if it be very large, so 
much water will be required that the veal will be deprived of 
its flavour ; it should be well covered with it, and very gently 
boiled until it is perfectly tender in every part, but not so much 
done as to separate froin the bone. Clear off the scum with 
scrupulous care when the simmering first commences, and throw 
in a small portion of salt; as this, if sparingly used, will not 
redden the meat, and will otherwise much improve it. Parsley 
and butter is usually both poured over, and sent to table with a 
knuckle of veal, and boiled bacon also should accompany it 
From the sinewy nature of this joint, it requires more tnan the 
usual time of cooking, a quarter of an hour to the pound not 
being suflicient for it. 

Veal, 6 to 7 lbs. : 2 hours or more. 

KNUCKLE or VEAL WITH BICE OB 6BBEN PEAS.

t&e jomt has siimnered for about half an hour, throw in from eight 
to twelve ounces of well washed rice, and stew the yeal gently 
for an hour and a half longer, or until both the meat and rice 
are perfectly tender. A seasoning of cayenne and mace in fine 
powder with more salt, should it be required, must be added 
twenty or thirty minutes before they are served. For a supe- 
rior stew good veal broth may be substituted for the water. 

Veal, 6 lbs.; water, 3^ to 4 pints; salt, 1 teaspoonful: 30 to 
40 minutes. Rice, 8 to 12 ozs. : 1^ hour. Seasonmg of cayenne, 
mace, and more salt if needed. A quart or even more of ftdl 
grown green peas added to the veal as soon as the scum has 
been cleared on will make a most excellent stew. It should be 
well seasoned with white pepper, and the mace should be 
omitted. Two or three cucumbers, pared and freed from the 
seeds, may be sliced into it when it boils, or four or five young 
lettuces shred miall may be added instead. Green onions also, 
when they are liked, may be used to give it flavour. 

SMALL PAIN BE VEAU, OB, VEAL CAKE. 

Chop separately, and very fine, a pound and a quarter of veal 
quite nee from fat and skin, and six ounces of beef kidney-suet ; 
add a teaspoonM of salt, a full third as much of white pepper, 
and of mace or nutmeg, with the grated rind of half a lemon, 
and turn the whole well together with the chopping-knife 
until it is thoroughly mixed : then press it smoothly into a 
small, round baking dish, and send it to a moderate oven for an 
hour and a quarter. Lift it into a clean, hot dish, and serve it 
plain, or witn a little brown gravy in a tureen. Three ounces ' 
of the lean of a boiled ham minced small, will very much im- 
prove tins cake, of which the size can be increased at will, and 
proportionate time allowed for dressing it. If baked in a hot 
oven, the meat will shrink to half its proper size, and be very 
.dry. When done, it should be of a fine light brown, and like 
a cake in appearance. 

Veal, l^lb.; beef-suet, 6 ozs.; salt^ 1 teaspoonful; pepper

cayenne, the third part of a nutmeg, grated, and a half-tea- 
rooonful of freshly pounded maoe. When it is pressed into the 
01^ let it be somewhat higher in the centre than at the edge; 
and whether to be served hot or cold, lift it out as soon as it 
comes from the oven, and place it on a strainer that the fat may 
drain from it : . it will keep many days if the under side be dry. 
The bacon should be weighed after the rind, and any ruiitit may 
exhibit, have been trimmed from it : that cured by the East 
Farleigh receipt, (see Chapter XL) is best for the purpose. 
This cake is excellent cold, better indeed than the preceidiiig 
one ; but slices of either if preferred hot, may be wanned 
through in a Dutch oven, or on the ^diron, or in a few 
spoonfflul of gray}^ The same ingredients made into small 
<»ke9, well floured, and slowly M^ £rom twelve to fifteen 
minutes, then served with gravy made in the pan as for cuUeta, 
will be found extremely good. 

Veal, 1^ lb.; stripea bacon, 8 ozs.; salt and mace, 1 tea- 
spoonful each ; rind of lemon, 1 ; third of 1 nutmeg ; cayenne, 
4 grains : baked 1^ to 1^ hour. 

FBICAia>EAU OF VEAL. (eNTB^e). 

French cooks always prefer for this dirii, which is a oammon 
one in their own country, that part of the fillet to which the fat 
or udder is attached f but the flesh of the finer part of the 
neck, or loin, raised clear from the bones, may be made to an- 
swer the purpose nearly, or quite as well, ana often much more 
^ conveniently, as the meat with us is not divided for sale as in 
^France; and to purchase the entire fillet, for the sake of the 
fricandeau, would render it exceedingly expensive. Lay the 
veal flat upon a table, or dresser, with the skm uppermost, and 
endeavour, with one stroke of an exceedingly sharp knife, to 
cleu: this off, and to leave the surface of the meat extremely 
smooth ; next lard it thickly with small lardomis, as directed for 
a pheasant (page 166^, and make one or two incisions in the 
imderside with the pomt of a knife, that it may the better im- 
bibe the flavour of the seasonings. Take a stewpan, of sufficient 
size to hold the fricandeau, and the proper quantity of vegetS' 
bles compactly arranged, without much room being left rouod 
the meat. Irit into it a couple of large carrots, cut in thick 
slices, two onions of moderate size, two or three roots of parsley* 
three bay leaves, two small blades of mace, a branch or two of 
lemon thyme, and a little cayenne, or a saltspoonM of white p^r

percorns. Raise these high in the centre of the stewpan, so as 
to support the meat, and prevent its touching the W^^J' Cover 
them with slices of very fat bacon, and place the nicandeau 
geatly on them ; then poor in as much good veal broth, or 
stock, as will nearlv cover the vegetables without reaching to 
the veal. A calTs foot, split in two, may with advantage belaid 
luider them in the first instance. Stew the fricandeau very 
gently for upwards of three hours, or until it is found to be 
extremely tender when probed with a fine skewer or a lardins- 
pio. Plenty of live embers must then be put on the lid of the 
stewpan for ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, to render the 
lardoons firm. Lift out the fricandeau, and keep it hot ; strain 
and reduce the gravy very quickly, after having skimmed off 
every particle of fat ; glaze the veid, and serve it on a ragout of 
sorrel, cucumbers, or spinach. This, though rather an elaborate 
receipt, is the best we can offer to the reader for a dish, which 
TR now almost as &shionable with us as it is common on the 
Continent. Some English cooks have a very summary method 
of preparing it ; they merely lard and boil the veal until they 
can "^ cut it with a spoon,** tnen glaze and serve it with ^ brown 
gravv in the dish." This may he very tolerable eating, but it 
¥rill bear small resemblance to the French fricandeau*

SPEDfG-STBW OF VEAL. 

Cut two pounds of veal, free frx)m fat, into small half-inch 
thick cutlets ; flour them well, and frv them in butter with two 
small cucumbers sliced, sprinkled vtrith pepper, and floured, one 
moderate sized lettuce, and twenty four green gooseberries cut 
open lengthwise and seeded. When the wnole is nicely browned, 
mt it into a thick saucepan, and pour gradually into the pan 
half a pint, or rather more, of boiling water, broth, or pavy. 
Add as much salt and pepper as it requires. Give it a nunute's 
ammer, and pour it over the meat, snaking it well round the 
pan as this is done. Let the veal stew gently from three quar- 
ters of an hour to an hour. A bunch of sreen onions cut small 
may be added to the other vegetables if liked ; and the veal will 
eat better, if slightly seasoned with salt and pepper before it is 
floured ; a portion of fat can be left on it if preferred.

nest possible slices, and let them be free from fat and skin. Slice 
also, very thin, a pound of striped bacon, and trim away the 
rind. Mix thoroughly a dessertspoonfol of salt, a teaspoonful 
of pounded mace, as much of nutmeg, one and a half of white 
pepper, and the minced or grated rinds of two lemons, and with 
these season the Teal equally ; butter thickly a deep earthen- 
pan, and lay the meat in smoothly in alternate layers, begin- 
ning with the bacon ; press the whole closely down, put a round 
of buttered paper over it, tie on the cover of the pan, set it 
into a large saucepan of warm water, and let it simmer for two 
hours and a half from the time of its beginning to boil. If 
to be served hot, merely heap the meat upon a dish, skim 
the fat firom the gravy, and pour it over ; but if to be eaten 
cold, which it more usually is, put a plate with a weight upon 
it on the top of the brezolles, pour all the gravy from them, 
and leave them in the pan for four and twenty hours, when 
they will turn out in a solid mass or o^e, and remain good 
many days if kept in a cool place ; the gravy, strained, aod 
reduced to jelly, may be placed round them as a garnish. 
The brezolles may, if more convenient, be baked in a gentle 
oven, but they will then require rather less time. In France 
they are conunonly stewed as slowly as possible, and when half 
done, a couple of glasses of white wme or of rich gravy is added 
to them; minced herbs are also sometimes strewed between the 
layers of meat.

Brown in a stewpan, or fry lightly, after having sprinkled 
them with pepper, salt and flour, from two to three pounds of 
veal cutlets, if taken from the neck, chop the bones ^^ 
short, and trim away the greater part of the fat. Arrange 
them as flat as they can be in a saucepan ; give a pint of hot 
water a boil in the pan in which they have been browned, and 
pour it on them ; add a small faggot of parsley, and, should the 
flavour be liked, one of green onions also. Let the meat 
sinuner softly for half an hour ; then cover it with small new 
potatoes which have had a single boil in water, give the sauce- 

Ean a shake, and let the harrico stew very gently for another 
alf hour, or until the potatoes are quite done, and the veal js 
tender. When the cutlets are thick and the potatoes approach

^im the fkt from it, and add salt and pepper should it not be 
soficiently seasoned. A few bits of lean nam, or shoolder of 
bacon browned with the veal, will much improve this dish, and 
for some tastes, a little add will render it more agreeable. Very 
delicate pork diops may be dressed in the same way.

l^e them, if possible, free from bone, and after having

well to prevent the escape of the gravy, and fry them from 
twelve to fifteen minutes over a firc wnich is not sufficiently 
fieroe to bum them before they are quite cooked through : they 
should be of a fine amber brown, and perfeeUy done. Lin

dessertspoonful of flour ; keep these shaken untQ they are well- 
colGured, then pour gradually to them a cup of gravy or boil- 
ing water ; add pepper, salt, a little lemon pickle or juice, give 
the whole a boil, and pour it over the cutlets : a few forcemeat 
balls, fried, and served with them, is usually a very acceptable 
addition to this dish, even when it is garnished or aooompanied 
with rashers of ham or bacon. A morsel of glaze^ or of the 
jelly of roast meat, should, when at hand, be added to the 
aanoe, which a little mushroom powder would fruther improve : 
muslmwm sauce, indeed, is considered by many epicures, as in- 
dispensable with veal cutlets. We have recommended, in this 
one instance, that the meat should be thoroughly beaten^ be- 
cause we find that the veal is wonderfully improved by the 
process, which, however, we still deprecate for other meat

pour to them a cup of gravy or boiling water, add salt and 
cayenne, if required, and the strained juice of half a lemon ; 
simmer the whole till weU flavoured, and pour it round the

likewise be served with only well-made common cutlet gravy, 
from the pan, when much of the pungent flavour of the curhe- 
powder is not desired.

Cut the veal into small, thin, round collops of equal sice, 
arrange them evenly in a saute-pan, or in a small frying-pan, 
and sprinkle a little fine salt, white pepper, and crated nutm^ 
on them. Clarify, or merely dissolve in a ckan saucepan, 
with a gentle degree of heat, an ounce or two of good butter, and 
pour it equally over the meat. Set the pan aside until the 
dinner-hour, then fry the collops over a clear fire, and when 
they are lightly browned, which will be in from four to five 
minutes, lift them into a hot dish, and sauce them with a 
little Espagnole, or witl) a gravy made quicklv in the pan, and

even without any sauce.

Baise the flesh entire from the upper side of the hest end of 
a neck of veal, free it from the skin, and from the greater por- 
tion of the iat, slice it equally into cutlets little more than a 
quarter of an inch thick, orush them with egg, strew them with 
fine hread-cnunhs, and fr^ them of a hght brown. Toast, or 
try apart as many small shces of bacon as there are cutlets, and 
let them be trimmed n^^ly to the same shape ; place them 
alternately on their edges round the inside of a hot dish (so as 
to form a sort of chain), and pour into the middle some rich 
gravy made in the pan, and very shghtly flavoured with escha- 
lot; or substitute mr this some good brown mushroom sauce. 
Savoury herbs, grated lemon-rind, nutmeg, or mace, salt, and 
white pepper, or cayenne, should be mixed with the bread- 
crumbs, in the proportions directed at page 200, for cutlets of 
calf 8 head ; or they may be varied at pleasure. A cheek of 
bacon is best adapted to this dish. 

sweetbbeads. (entb^.) 
(Simply dressecL) 

In whatever way sweetbreads are dressed, they should first be 
well soaked in lukewarm water, then thrown into boiling water 
to blanch them, as it is called, and to render them Ann. If 
liiled out after the^ have boiled from five to ten minutes, 
according to their size, and laid immediately into fresh spring 
water to cool, their colour will be the better preserved. They 
may then be gentlv stewed for three quarters of an hour in v^ 
grav^, which, with the usual additions of cream, lemon, and 
egg-yolks, may be converted into a fricassee sauce for them, 
when they are done ; or they may be lifted from it, glazed, and 
served with good Spanish gravy; or, the glazing being omitted, 
they may be sauced with the sharp Maitre £ Hotel sauce of 
^e 106. The^ may also be simply floured, and roasted in a 
Dutch' oven, being oft;en basted with butter, and frequently 
turned. A frdl sized sweetbread, after having been blanched, 
will require quite three quarters of an hour to dress it.

fine bread-crumbs, seasoned with salt, cayenne, grated lemon- 
rind, and mace ; fry them in butter oi a fine light biown, 
arrange them in a dish, placing them high in the centre, and 
pour under them a gravy ma^e in the pan, thickenei with 
mushroom powder, and flavoured with lemon-juice ; or, in lien 
of this, sauce them with some rich brown gravy, to which a 

glass of sherxy or Madeira has been added. When "it can be 
one conveniently, take as many shoes of a cold boiled tcmgue, 
as there are sweetbread cutlets ; t>are the rind from them, trim 
them into good shape, and dress them with the sweetbreads, 
after they nave been egged and seasoned in the same way; 
place each cutlet upon a slice of ton^e when they are dished. 
For variety, substitute croutons of fiied bread, stamped oat to 
the size of the cutlets, with a round or fluted paste or cake 
cutter. The crumb of a stale loaf, veiy evenly slic^ is best 
for the purpose. 

STEWED calf's FEET. 

{Cheap and good,) 

This is an excellent family dish, highly nutritionji, and often 
very ines^nsive, as the feet, during 'the summer, are nsnally 
sola at a low rate. Wash them with nicety, divide them at the 
joint, and split the claws; arrange them closely in a thick 
stewpan or saucepan, and pour in as much cold water as will 
cover them about naif an inch : three pints will be sufficient for 
a couple of large feet. When broth or stock ia at hand, it is 
good economy to substitute it for the water, as, by this means, a 
portion of strong and well-flavoured jellied gravy will he 
obtained for general use, the full quantity not b^g needed as 
sauce for the feet. The whole preparation wifi be much 
improved by laying a thick slice of the lean of an unboiled ham, 
knuckle of bacon, hung bee^ or the end of a dried tcmgue, at 
the bottom of the pan, before the other ingredients are added; 
or, when none of these are at hand, by sup^ying the deficiency 
with a few bits of stewing-beef or veal : the feet being of them- 
selves insipid, will be much more palatable with one or the 
other of these additions. Throw in mun half to three quarters 
of a teaspoonfiil of salt, when they begin to boil, and, aner the 
scum has been all cleared off, add a few branches of parsley, a 
little celery, one small onion or more, stuck with hau a doxen 
doves, a carrot or two, a large blade of mace, and twenty oonis 
of whole pepper; stew them softly until the flesh will part 
entirely from the bones; take it from them ; strain part of the

other store sauce, and thicken it, when it bcnis, with arrow- 
loot, or floor and batter ; put in the flesh of the feet, and serve 
the diah as soon as the whole is very hot. A glass of wine, a 
little lemon-jaioe, and a few forcemeat halls will oonvert this 
into a very superior stew ; a handful of mushroom-butt^ms also 
ammered in it for half an hour before it is dished, will vary it 
agreeably.

calf's uyeb fried. 

To render the liver firm when dressed, lay it into a deep dish, 
and pour over it half a pint of vinegar; turn it often in this, 
and let it lie for four and twenty hours, or longer even, if more 
oonvenient. Sliced onions, or eschalots, and branches of parsley, 
maj be steeped with it in the vinegar, when their flavour is 
relished ; but, in general, they would not, we think, be con- 
sidered an improvement. Wash and wipe the liver very dry, 
slice it evenly, season it with pepper, salt, and savoury herbs 
shred extremely small, then floor and firy it in butter quickly 
of a fine light brown ; lift it out and keep it very hot, while a 
gravy is made for it in the pan. Four out the fat, throw in a 
small slice of fresh butter, and when it boils stir to it a half- 
teaspoonful of flour; add a seasoning of pepper and salt; 
about a quarter-pint of boiling water, and a little lemon-juice. 
Chili vin^ar, or lemon-pickle ; shake the pan well round, give 
the whole a boil ; sauce the liver with it, and send it to table 
^ith or without a garnish of curled bacon. 

TO BOAST calf's LIVSB. 

Take the whole or part of a fine white sound liver, and either 
lard it as a fricandeau upon the surface, t>r with large strips of 
highly-seasoned bacon in the inside (see Larding, page 166) ; 
or should either of these modes be objected to, merely wrap it 
in a well-buttered paper, and roast it from an hour to an hour 
and a quarter, at a moderate distance from a dear fire, keeping 
it constantly basted. Remove the paper, and froth the Uver 
well firom ten to fifteen minutes before it is done. It should be 
served with a sauce of some piquancy, such as a poivrade, or 
brown eschalot, in addition to some good gravy. French cooks 



218 MODERN COOKERY. []CHAP. IX* 

steep the liver over-night in vinegar, with a sliced onion aiid 
branches of savouiy herbs Lud over it ; this whitens and 
renders it firm. As an eeonomicsl mode, some small bits of the 
liver may be trimmed off, floured, and lightly fried with a 
sliced onion, and stewed down for gravy in three quarters of a 
pint of water which has been poured into the pan, with the 
addition of a few peppercorns, and a small bimch of herbs. A 
seasoning of salt must not be forgotten, and a little lemon 
pickle, or juice, would generally be considered an improvement 
1 to li hour. 

blakuvettx of yxal ob ijlmb, with mushsooms. 

(entbee.) 

Slice very thin the white part of some cold veal, divide and 
trim it into scallops not larger than a shilling, and lay it into a 
clean saucepan or stewpon. Wipe with a bit of new flannel 
and a few grains of salt, firom a quarter to half a pint of mush- 
room-buttons, and slice them into a little butter which just 
begins to simmer; stew them in it from twelve to fifteen 
minutes, without allowing them to take the slightest oolonr; 
then lift them out and lay them on the veal. Pour boiling to 
them a pint of sauce toum^e (see pi^ 96) ; let the blanquette 
remain near but not close to the me for awhile ; hiins it 
nearer, heat it dowly, and when it is on the point of bomng 
mix a spoonful or two of the sauce from it with the well beaten 
yolks of four fresh eggs; stir them to the remainder; add the 
strained juice of half a small lemon ; shake the saucepan above 
the fire until the sauce is just set, and serve the blanquette 
instantly. 

Cold veal, f lb. ; mushrooms, i to i pint: stewed in U ok 
buttef, 12 to 15 minutes. Sauce toum^e, or thickened veal 
gravv, 1 pint ; yolks of eggs, 4 ; lemon-juice, 1 tablespoonfol. 

Obs, — Any white meat may be served en blanquette. The 
mushrooms are not indispensable for it, but they are always a 
great improvement. White sauce substituted for the thickened 
veal gravy will at once convert this dish into an inexpensire 
fricassee. Mace, salt, and cayenne, must be added to either 
preparation, should it require seasoning. 

MINCED VEAL. 

When there is neither gravy nor broth at hand, the bones 
and trimmings of the meat must be boiled down to frimish what 
is required for the mince. As cold meat is very light in 
weight, a pound of the white part of the veal will be sufficient 



CBi?. IS..] YEAZi. 210 

for a disb, and for this quantify a pint of gravy will be needed* 

Break down the bones of the joint well, add the trimmings oi 

the meat, a small bunch of savoury herbs, a slice or two of 

carrot or of celery, a blade of mace, a few white pepperconis, 

and a bit or two of lean ham, boiled, or unboiled if it can be 

liad, as either will improve the flavour of the mince. Pour to 

these a pint and a half of water, and stew them gently for a 

coupie of hours ; then strain off the ^vy, let it cool and dear 

it entirely from the fat. Cut the white part of the veal small 

inth a veiy sharp knife, after all the gnstle and brown edges 

have been trimmed away. Some persons like a portion of fiit 

minced with it, others object to the addition altogether. Thicken 

the gravy with a teaspoonful and a half of flour smoothly 

mixed with a small slice of butter, season the veal with a nlt- 

spoonM or more of salt, and half as much white pepper and 

^ted nutmeg, or pounded mace ; add the lightly-grated rind 

of half a small lemon ; *mix the whole well, nut it into the 

gravy, and heat it thoroughly by the side of uie fire without 

allowing it to boil ; serve it witn pale-toasted sippets in and 

ronnd the dish. A spoonful or two of cream is always an 

improvement to this mince. 

MINCED VEAI. AlTD OTSTEBS. 

The most elegant mode of preparing this dish is to mince 
ahout a pound of the whitest part of the inside of a cold roast 
fillet or loin of veal, to heat it without allowing it to boO, in a 
pint of rich white sauce, or bechamel, and to mix with it at the 
moment of serving, three dozens of small oysters ready bearded, 
and plumped in their own strained liquor, which is also to be 
added to the mince ; the requisite quantity of salt, cayenne, and 
maoe should be sprinkled over the veal before it is put into the 
^nce. Garnish the dish with pale fried sippets of bread, or 
^n^fleurons* of brioche, or of puff-paste. Nearly half a pint 
of mushrooms minced, and stewed wnite in a little butter, may

Pour boiling on an ounce and a half of fine bread-crambs 
nearly half a pint of ^ood yeal stock or gravy, and let them 
stand till cool ; mix with them then, two ounces of beef-suet 
shred very small, half a pound of cold roast veal careftilly 
trimmed from the brown edges, skin, and &t, and finely minced; 
the grated rind of half a lemon, nearly a teaspoonfiil of salt, a 
little cayenne, the third of a teaspoonfiil of mace or nutmeg, 
and four well-beaten eggs. Whisk up the whole well together, 
put it into a buttered oiBh, and bake it from three quarters of 
an hour to an hour. Cream may be used instead of gravy when 
more convenient, but this last will give the better flavour. A 
little clarified butter put into the dish before the other ingre- 
dients are poured in will be an improvement

rSICASSEED VEAL. 

Divide into small, thick, handsome slices of equal size, about 
a couple of pounds of veal, quite free from fat, bone, and skin; 
dissolve a couple of ounces of butter in a wide stewpan, and just 
9s it begins to boil lay in the veal, and shake it over the fire 
until it is quite firm on both sides ; but do not allow it to take 
the slightest colour. Stir in a tablespoonful of flour, and when 
it is well mixed with the cutlets, pour gradually to them, shaking 
the pan often, sufficient boilii^ v^-gravy to almost cover 
them. Stew them gently from fifty to sixty minutes, or longer 
should they not be perfecthr tender. Add a flavouring of mace, 
some salt, a quarter-pint of rich cream, a couple of egg-yolks, 
and a little lemon-juice, observing, when the last are added, the 
directions given for a blanquette of veal, pace 218. Strips of 
lemon-rind can be stewed in the gravy at pleasure. Two or 
three dozens of mushroom-buttons, added twenty minutes before 
it is served, will much improve this fricassee.

TO CHOOSE MUTTON. 



The best mutton is smaU-boned, plump, finelv-grained, and 
short-legged ; the lean of a dark, rather than of a bright hue, 
uid the &t. white and clear: when this is yellow, the meat is 
rank, and of bad quality. Mutton is not considered by expe- 
lieQced judges .to be in perfection until it is nearly or quite nve 
years old; but to avoia the additional expense of feeding the 
s^umal so loE^, it is commonly brought into the market at three 
yean old. The' leg and the loin are the superior joints ; and 
the preference would probably be given more firequently to the 
latter, but for the superabundance of its fat, which renders it a 
not very economical dish. The haunch consists of the leg and 
the part of the loin adjoining it; the saddle, of the two loins- 
together, or of the undivided back of the sheep : these last are 
^ways roasted, and are served usually at good tables, or for 
company-dinners instead of the smaller joints. The shoulder, 
brewed in the ordinary way, is not very highly esteemed, but 
when boned, rolled, and fflled with forcemeat, it is of more 
presentable appearance, and to many tastes, &r better eating; 
though some persons prefer it in its natural form, accompanied 
hy stewed onions. It is occasionally boiled or stewed, and- 



222 MODERN COOKERY. [cHAP. Z. 

ooYered with rich onion sauce. The neck is sometimes roasted, 
but it is more generally boiled ; the scrag, or that part of it 
which joins the head, is seldom used for any other purpose than 
making broth, and should be taken off before the joint is dressed. 
Cutlets from the thick end of the loin are commonly preferred 
to any others, but they are frequently taken likewise from the 
best end of the neck (sometimes called the back-ribs) and from 
tiie middle of the leg. Mutton kidneys are dressed in various 
ways, and are excellent in many. The trotters and the head of 
a sheep may be converted into yery good dishes, but they are 
scarcely worth the trouble which is required to render them 
pdatable. The loin and the leg are occasionally ciired and 
smoked like hams or bacon. 

« 

Tb BOAST A HAUNCH OF MUTTON. 

This joint should be well kept, and when the larder-acoom- 
modations of a house are not good, the butcher should be re- 
quested to hang it the proper time. Boast it carefully at a 
Jarf^e sound fire, and let it remain at a considerable distance for 
at least a couple of hours ; then draw it nearer, but never suf- 
ficiently so to bum or injure the fat. Keep it constantly basted ; 
flour it soon after it is laid to the fire, instead of frothing it, as 
this latter mode is not generally relished, though fashion is in 
its favour. In from th^ and a half to four hours, the haunch 
will be done, and it will require something less of time when 
not kept back at first, as we have advised ; but if roasted en- 
tirely on the plan mentioned at page 157 it will be much finer 
than in the usual way. Serve it with a good Espagnole, or inth 
plain mutton-gravy and currant-jelly. This joint, when the 
meat is of very fine quality, may be dressed and served exactly 
like venison. 

9i to 4 hours. 6 hours or more by the slow method. 

BOAST SADDLE OF MUTTON. 

This is an excellent joint, though not considered a vc^ eco- 
nomical one. It is usual for the butcher to raise the skin from 
it before it is sent in, and to skewer it on again, that in the 
roasting the juices of the meat may be better preserved, and 
the fiit prevented from taking too much colour, as this should 
be only slightly browned. In something less than half an hoof 
before the mutton is done, remove the skin, and flour the joint 
lightly after having basted it well. Our own great olgection 
to frothed meat would lead us to recommend that the skin 
should be taken off half an hour earlier, and that the jf^ 



CHIP. X.] MUTTON. 223 

should be kept at sufficient distance from the fire to preyent the 
possibility of the fat being burned ; and that something more of 
tone should be allowed for the roasting. With constant basting, 
great care, and good management, the cook may always ensure 
the proper appearance of this, or of any other joint (except, 
perhaps, of a haunch of venison) without haying recourse to 
papering or pasting, or even to replacing the skm ; but when 
unremitted attention cannot be given to this one part of the 
dinner, it is advisable to take idl precautions that can secure it 
from being spoiled. 
2^ to 2| hours. More if very large. 

TO BOAST A LEG OF MUTTON. 

In a cool and airy larder a leg of mutton will hang many 
days with advantage, if the kernel be taken out, and the flap 
wiped very dry i/men it is first brought in ; and it is never 
tender when freshly killed : in warm weather it should be well 
dredged with pepper to preserve it from the flies. If washed 
before it is put upon the spit, it should be wiped as dry as pos- 
sible after^vBTds, and well floured soon after it is laid to the fire. 
When the excellence of the joint is more regarded than the ex- 
pense of fuel, it should be roasted by what we have denomi- 
nated the sbiw method ; that is to say, it should be kept at a 
considerable distance from the fire, and remain at it four hours 
mstead of two : it may be drawn nearer for the last twenty or 
thirty minutes to give it colour. The gravy will flow from it 
in great abundance when it is cut, and the meat will be ver^ 
superior to that roasted in the usual way. When this plan is 
not pursued, the mutton should still be kept quite a foot from 
the fire until it is heated through, and never brought suffi- 
ciently near to scorch or to haraen any part. It Siould be 
cmstantly basted with its own fat, fOr if this be neglected, all 
other precautions will fail to ensure a good roast ; and after it 
is dished a little fine salt should be sprinkled lightly on it, and 
a spoonfiil or two of boiling water laded over. This is the most 
palatable mode of serving it, but it may be frothed when it is 
preferred so, though we would rather recommend that the flour 
shoiild be driedged on in the first instance, as it then prevents 
the juices of the meat from escaping, and forms a savoury coat- 
ing to it ; while the raw taste which it so often retains with 
mere frothing is to many eaters especially objectionable.

'bUPESIOB RECEIPT "FOB BOAST LEG OP BfUTTOH. 

CJover the joint well with cold water, bring it gradually to 
boil, and let it simmer gently for half an hour ; then lift it out, 
put it immediately on to the spit, and roast it from an hour and 
a quarter to an hour and a half, according to its weight. This 
mode of dressing the joint renders it remarkably juicy and ten- 
den; but there must be no delay in putting it on the spit after 
it is lifted from the water. A mild ragout of garlic (see j)age 
122,) may be served in the dish with it, or it may be garnished 
with roast tomatas. 

Boile4) i hour ; roast, 1^ to 1^ hour. 

BBAISEn LEQ OP MUTTON. 

Take out the bone as far as the first joint by the directions 
of the following receipt, roll some large strips of bacon in ft 
seasoning of mixed spice, and of savoury nerbs minced extremely 
fine, or dried and r^uced to powder, and with these lard the 
inside of the boned portion of the joint ; or fill the cavity with 
forcemeat highly seasoned with eschalot or garlic. Sew up the 
meat, and place it in a braising-pan, or ham-kettle nearly of its 
size, with slices of bacon under and over it, two or three onions, 
four or five carrots, two bay leaves, a large bunch of savoury 
herbs, a few bones, or bits of imdressed mutton or veal, and 
about three quarters of a pint of gravy. Stew the meat as 
softly as possible from four to five hours, and keep live embers 
on the top of the pan (or, as this mode of cooking is not general 
in England, set the mutton, if it can be done convenienUy, into 
a moderately-heated oven, after having luted the edges of the 
vessel in which it is arranged, with a bit of coarse paste) ; lift it 
out, strain the gravy, reduce it quickly to glaze, and brush the 
meat with it ; or merely strain, free it from fat, and pour it over 
the mutton. White beans (haricots blancs), boiled tender and 
well drained, or a mild ragout of garlic or eschalots, may be 
laid in the dish under it. The joint can be braised equally well 
without any part of it being boned. 

4 to 5 hours. 

LEG OF MUTTON BONED AND FOBCED. 

Turn the underside of the mutton upwards, and with a sharp 
knife cut through the middle of the skin from the knuckle to 
the first joint, and raise it from the flesh on the side along which 
the bone runs, until the knife is iust above it, then cut tnrough 
the flesh down to the bone ; work the knife round it in everj

cat open, and tie the knuckle round tightly, to preyent the 
escape of the gravy. Replace the flat bone at the large end, and 
with a long needle and twine, draw the edges 'of the meat to- 
gether over it. If it can be done conveniently, it is better to 
roast the mutton thus prepared in a cradle spit or upon a 
hanging or bottle-jack, with the knuckle downwurds. Place it 
at first &r from the fire, and keep it constantly basted. It will 
require nearly or quite three hoi^ roasting. Remove the twine 
before it is served, and send it yery hot to table with some rich 
brown gravy. 

lilOGK VSKISOH. 

Hang a plump and finely-grained 1^ of mutton in a cool 
place, for as many days as it can possibly be kept without 
becoming altogether uneatable. Lay it on a dish, pour over, 
and rub weU into it, about half a small cupful of pyroligneous 
add, and let it remain ten minutes. Wash it yery thoroughly, 
cut off the knuckle, and trim away the flap, and any part that 
may continue very offensiye, or ts&e a few inches from either 
end of the joint ; then lay it into a dose-shutting stewpot, or 
thick iron saucepan of its own size, with no other liquid dian 
the drops of water which adhere to it, and sinmier it over a very 
slow file, from four and a half to five hours, turning it several 
times, that it may be equally done. Give it no seasoning beyond 
pepper and salt." Should the gravy be too much reduced, add 
two spoonsful of boiling water, or of mutton gravy. Send the 
meat to table in its own juices, with currant jeUy, or sharp veni- 
son saooe apart . We owe this receipt entirely to accident; for,

wishing to have proof of the anti-putr^scent qualiUes of the 
pyroligneouB acid, we had it applied to a le^ of matton which 
Aad been too long kept, and which was dressed in the way we have 
described. When brought to table, its resemblance to Tenison, 
both in appearance and flavour, was remarkable ; and seyerai 
persons partook of it hashed on the following day, and were all 
' perfectly unconscious that they were not really eating venison; 
in the latter instance, it was served in rich gravy made in part 
of hare ; a glass of port wine, a little compound catsup, and a 
thickening of rice flour were added. The meat, of course, was 
only heated through, and not allowed to boU. On a second 
trial we found it an improvement to touch the mutton in every 
part with a feather dipped in the add, as soon as it gave eyi- 
dence of having been sufficiently kept, and then to let it hang 
three or ibur ^ys longer : it was again washed with the add, 
and afterwards with cold water before it was dressed. 

TO BOIX. A LEO OF MI7TT0K. 

(An excellent Receipt,) 

Trim into handsome form a well-kept, but perfectly sweet leg 
of mutton, of middling weight ; wash, but do not soak it ; lay it 
into a vessel as nearly of its size as convenient, and pour in rather 
more than sufficient cold water to cover it ; set it over a good 
fire, and when it begins to boil, take off the scum, and continue 
to do so until no more appears ; throw in a tablespoonfol of salt 
(after the first skimming), which will assist to bring it to the 
surface, and as soon as the liquor is clear, add two moderate-sized 
onions, stuck with a dozen doves, a large faggot of parsley, 
thyme, and savoury, and four or five large carrots, and half an 
hour afterwards, as many turnips. Draw the pan to the side of 
the fire, and let the mutton be simmered gently for two hours 
and a half, from the time of its first beginning to boU. Serre 
it with caper, brown cucumber, or oyster, sauce. If stewed 
softlj/y as we have directed, the mutton will h& found excellent 
dressed thus ; otherwise, it will but resemble the unpalatable and 
ragsed-looking joints of fast-boiled meat, 86 constantly sent to 
table by conunon English cooks. Any undressed bon^ of veal, 
mutton, or beef, boiled with the joint, will improve it much, and 
the liquor will then make excellent soup or bouillon. 

2 to 2| hours. 

COLD BOAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

When only a few slices have been cut from the middle of the 
joint,^ it will still afford a fillet of tolerable size, which^ dressed 



OHIP.X.] MtTTTON. 227 

ib the fi^owing manna*, -will make a dish of better appearance 
and sayouT than a common hash or mince. Take off a^ much 
of the large end of tne 1^, quite through, as will render that 
side of the fillet perfectly flat ; cut ako evenly through the 
joint, where it has been carved ; then remove the bone from the 
^et, and replace it with veal forcemeat (No. 1, page 143); put 
the meat, with the bones, knuckle, and trimmings, into a stew- 
pot, or stout saucepan adapted to its size, and just cover it with 
water, or with broth in preference, when any stock is at hand ; 
ss soon as it boils, add a couple of onions, a bunch of parsley, 
two or even three bay leaves, four or five carrots, and as many 
turnips (plenty of vegetables, in fact), and simmer the whole 
gmtly for nearly, or quite a couple of hours. Thickening, 
spice, or store-sauce, can be added to the gravy at will, before 
the meat is served, which it should be with the vegetables 
romid it. 

A FILLET OF MUTTON. 

Cut some inches from either end of a lai ge and well-kept leg 
of mutton, and leave the fillet shaped like (.ne of veal. Remove 
the bone, and fill the cavity with forcemeat (No. 1, page 143), 
which may be flavoured with a little minced eschalot, when its 
&yonr is liked : more forcemeat may be added by detaching the 
skin suffidently on the flap side to admit it. When thus prepared, 
the fillet may be floured, and roasted, served with currant- jelly 
and brown gravy, or with only melted butter poured over it ; or 
it may be stewed gently for nearly or quite four hours, in a pint 
of gravy or water, after having been floured and browned all over 
in a couple of ounces of butter ; it must then be turned every hour 
that it may be equally done. Two or three small onions, a 
faggot of herbs, a couple of carrots sliced, four or five cloves, 
and twenty whole peppercorns can be added at will. 

Boasted 2 hours, or stewed 4 hours. 

TO BOAST A LOIN OP MUTTON. 

The flesh of the loin of mutton is superior to that of the leg,, 
when roasted ; but to the frugal housekeeper this consideration 
is usually overbalanced by tne great weight of fat attached to 
It; this, however, when economy is more considered than ap- 
pearance, may be par^d off and melted down for various kitchen 
^^ or finely chopped, and substituted for suet in making hot 
pie or pudding crust. When thus reduced in size, the mutton 
^ be soon roasted. If it is to be dressed in the usual way, the 



228 MODERN COOKERY. |^CHAP. X. 

bntcher should be desired to take off the skin ; care should b& 
taken to preserve the fat from being ever so slightly bnmed; it 
should be managed, indeed, in the same manner as the saddle, 
in every respect, and carved also in the same way, that is to s^, 
the meat should be cut out in slices the whole length of tne 
back-^bone, and dose to it. 
Without the fat, 1 to 1^ hour ; with 1^ to If hour. 

. TO DRESS A LOIN OF MUTTON IJKE VENISON. 

Skin and bone a loin of mutton, and lay it into a stewpan, or 
braising-pan, with a pint of water, a large onion stuck with a 
dozen cloves, half a pint of port wine and a spoonful of vine- 
gar ; add, when it* boils, a small faggot of thyme and paisle;^, 
and some pepper and salt : let it stew three hours, and turn it 
often. Make some gravy of the bones, and add it at intervals 
to the mutton when required. 

This receipt comes to us so strongly recommended by peisons 
who have ptartaken frequently of the dish, that we nave not 
thought it needful to prove it ourselves. 

3 hours. 

TO ROAST A 8HOUIJ>EB OP MUTTON. 

Flour it well, and baste it constantlv with its own drippins; 
do not place it close enough to the fire for the^at to be in the 
slightest degree burned, or even too deeply browned. An houf 
and a half will roast it, if it be of moderate size. Stewed onions 
are often sent to table with it. A shoulder of mutton is some* 
times boiled, and smothered with onion sauce.

day add four ounces of salt. Keep the mutton turned, and 
rubbed occasionally with the pickle from eight to ten days; 
then roll it up tight, bind it with a fillet, and stew it gently for 
four hours in a pint and a half of beef broth, or put into the

browned with some turnips or carrots, or both, and made into a 
small harrico, or stewed simply in its own gravy, or it will 
make in part, a pudding or a pie. Bone the mutton (see page 
167), flatten it on a table, lay over the inside some thin and 
neatiy-trimmed slices of striped bacon, and spread over them 
some good veal forcemeat (Ko. 1, page 143) to within an inch 
of the outer edge ; roll the joint up ti^tly towards the knuckle 
(of which the bone may be left in or not, at pleasure), secure it 
well with tape or twine, and stew it gently in good gr&yjj from

just dip them into cola water, dredge them moderately with pep-

saucepan with spring water, and leave a couple of tablespoonsful 
in it; arrange the cutlets in one flat layer, if it can be done con- 
veniently, and place them over a very gentle fire ; throw in a little 
salt when they begin to stew, and let them simmer as softli/ a»

ir and a half. If dressed with gr^t care, which the^ require, 
they will be equally tender, easy of digestion, and nutritious ; and 
being at the same time free from everything which can disagree 
with the most delicate stomach, the receipt will be found a 
valuable one for invalids. The mutton should be of good 
quality, but the excellence of the dish mainly depends on its 
oeing Tnost f^ently stewed; for if allowed to boil qpaickly all 
the gravy wfll be dried up, and the meat will be unfit for table.

TO BBOIL MUTTON CUTIJBTfl. (EHTBis.) 

These may be taken from the loin, or the best end of the 
neck, but the former are generally preferred. Trim off a 
portion of the fat, or the whole of it, umess it be liked ; pepper 
the cutlets, heat the gridiron, rub it with a bit of the muUou 
suet, broil them over a brisk fire, and turn them often until they 
are done ; this, for the generality of eaters, will be iu about 
eight minutes if they are not more than half an inch thick, 
which they should not be. French cooks season them with 
pepper and salt, and give them a light coating of dissolved 
butter or of oil, before they are laid to the fire, and we have 
found the cutlets so managed extremely good. 

Lightly broiled, 7 to 8 minutes. Well done, 10 minutes. 

Obs.—A cold M&itre d'Hotel sauce may be laid under the 
cutlets when they are dished ; or they may be served quite diy, 
or with brown gravy; or when none is at hand, with good 
melted butter seasoned with mushroom catsup, cayenne, and 
Chili vinegar, or lemon- juice.

Pat into a broad stewpan or saucepan, a flat layer of mutton 

cbops, freed entirely from fat and from the greater portion of 

the bone, then just dipped into cold water, seasoned wim pepper, - 

and lightly dredged with flour ; on these put a layer of mild

some carrots of the same thickness, with a seasoning of saJt and 

black pepper between them ; next, another layer of chops, then 

plenty of vegetables, and as much weak broth or cold water as 

vrill barely cover the whple ; bring them slowly to a boil, and 

let them just simmer frrom two to three hours, according to the 

quantity. One or two minced onions may be strewed between 

toe other vegetables when their flavour is liked. The savour of 

the dish wm be increased by browning the chops in a little 

batter before they are stewed, and still more so by frying the 

vegetables lightly as well, before they are added to it. A ncad 

or two of celery would to many tastes improve the flavour of the 

whole. In summer, cucumber, green onions, shred lettuces, and 

green peas may be substituted for the winter vegetables. 

Mutton, free from fat, 2^ lbs. ; turnips, 3 lbs. ; carrots, 3 lbs. ; 
celeiy (if added), 2 small heads : 2 to 3 hours. 

Obs, — ^The fat and trimmings of the mutton used for this and 
for other dishes into which only the lesm is admissible, may be 
tumed to advantage by cutting the whole up rather small, and 
then boiling it in a quart of water to the pound, with a little 
spice, a bundb of herbs and some salt, until the fat is nearly 
^ssolved : the liquid will then, if strained ofi* and left until cola, 
make tolerable broth, and the cake of fat which is on the top, 
if again just melted and poured free of sediment into small 
pans, win serve excellently for common pies and for frying 
Mtchen dinners. Less water will of course produce broth of 
better quality, and the addition of a small quantity of fr^h 
meat or bones will render it very good. 

AN IBISH ST£W. 

Take a couple of pounds of small thick mutton cutlets with 
or without fat accordmg to the taste of the persons to whom 
the stew is to be served; take also four pounds of good pota- 
toes, weight after they are pared, slice them thick, and put a 
portion of them in a flat layer, into a large thick saucepan or 
stewpan; season the mutton well with pepper, and place some 
of it on the potatoes, cover it with another layer, and proceed 
in Uie same manner with all, reserving plenty of the vegetable

for the top ; pour in three quarters of a pint of cold water, and 
add, when the stew hcgins to boil, an ounce of salt ; let it 
nmmer gently for two hours, and serve it veiy hot. When the 
addition of* onion is liked, strew in two or three minced ones 
with the potatoes. 

Mutton cutlets, 2 lbs. ; potatoes, 4 lbs. ; pepper, | oz. ; salt, 
1 oz. ; water, | pint: 2 hours. 

Obs, — For a real Irish stew the potatoes should be bdled to 
a mash : an additional quarter-hour may be necessary for the fid 
quantity here, but for half of it two hours are quite suffident 

CUTUSHS or COLD MUTTOH. 

Trim into well-shaped cutlets, which should not be veiy 
thin, the remuns of a roast loin or neck of mutton, or of a 
quite under-dressed stewed or boiled joint ; dip them into eg^ 
and well seasoned bread-crumbs, and broil or fry them over a 
quick fire that they may be broomed and heated through with- 
out being too much done. This is a veiy good mode of serr- 
ing a half roasted loin or neck. When the cutlets are broiled 
they should be dipped into, or sprinkled thickly with batter 
just dissolved, or they will be exceedingly dry ; a few additional 
crumbs should be made to adhere to tnem after they are mois" 
tened with this. 

MUTTON KIONET8 X LA FKANQAISB. (eNTRH^.) 

Skin six or eight fine fresh mutton kidneys, and without 
opening them, remove the fat ; slice them rather thin, strew 
over them a large dessertspoonM of minced herbs, of which two 
thirds should be parsley and the remainder thyme, with a tole* 
Table seasoning of pepper or cayenne, and some fine salt. Melt 
two ounces of butter in a fiymg-pan, put in the kidneys and 
brown them quickly on both « sides ; when nearly done, stir 
amongst them a dessertspoonful of flour and shake them well 
in the pan ; pour in the third of a pint of gravy (or of hot water 
in default of this), the juice of half a lemon, and as much of 
Harvey's sauce, or of mushroom catsup, as wrill flavour the whole 
pleasantly ; bring these to the point of boiling, and pour them inta 
a dish garnished with fried sippets, or lift out the kidneys first, 
give the sauce a boil and pour it on them. We genendly have the 
store-sauce of page 177 (see English stew) used to fliavoor this 
dish in preference to simple catsup. Li France, a couple of 
glasses of champagne, or, for variety, of claret, are firequently 
added to the gravy; one of port wine can be substituted

for either of these. A dessertspoonful of minced eschalots may 
be strewed over the kidneys with the herbs ; or two dozens of 
Teiy small ones, previously stewed till tender in fresh butter 
over a gentle fire, may be added after they are dished. This is 
a yeiy excellent and approved receipt, 
Fned 6 minutes. 

BROILEB MUTTON KIDNETS. 

Split them open lengthwise without dividing them ; strip off 
the skin and fat; run a fine skewer through the points and 
across the back of the kidneys to keep them Sat while broiling; 
season them with pepper or cayenne; lay them over a clear 
brisk fire, with the cut sides towards it ; turn them in from four 
to five minutes ; and in as many more dish, and serve them 
quickly, with or without a cola M^tre d'Hotel sauce under 
them. French cooks season them with pepper and fine salt, 
and brush a very small quantity of oil, or clarified butter over 
them before they are broiled : we think this an improvement. 

8 to 10 minutes. 

OXFOBB SECEIFT VOB MUTTON KIDNETS. (bBEAKTAST DISH,

Fiy gently, in a little good butter, a dozen croiitons (slices of 
bread, of uniform shape and size, trimmed free from crust), cut 
half an inch thick, about two inches and a half wide, and from 
three to four in len^h : lift them out and keep them hot. 
Split quite asunder six fine fresh kidneys, after having freed 
them nrom the skin and fat; season them with fine sdt and 
cayemie ; arrange them evenly in a clean frying-pan, and pour 
8ome clarified butter over them. Fry them over a somewhat 
brisk fire ; dish each half upon a crotlton ; make a sauce in the 
pan as for veal cutlets, but use gravy for it instead of water, 
should it be at hand ; add a little wine or catsup ; pour it round 
the crodtons, and serve the kidneys instantly. 

10 minutes.

This should be laid to a clear brisk fire, and carefully and 
plentifiiUy basted from the time of its becoming warm until it 
is ready for table ; but though it requires quick roasting, it must 
never be placed sufficiently near the fire to endanger the fat, 
which is very liable to catch or bum. When the joint is served, 
the shoulder should be separated from the ribs with a sharp knife, 
and a small slice of fresh butter, a little cayenne, and a squeeze of

TO CHOO 


SE POBK. 



Tms meat is so proverbially, and we believe even dan^erouAi 
unwholesome when ill fed, or in any degree diseased, that its 
quality should be closely examined before it is purchased. Whea 
not home-fatted, it should be bought if possible of some respect- 
able farmer, or miller, unless the butcher who supplies it can 
be perfectly relied on. Both the fat and lean should be xerf 
white, and the latter finely grained ; the rind should be thin, 
smooth, and cool to the touch ; if it be clammy, the pork is 
Stale, and should be at once rejected ; it ought also to be scru- 
pulously avoided when the fat, instead of being quite dear of 
all blemish, is full of small kernels, which are indicative of 
disease. The manner of cutting up the pork varies in different 
counties, and also according to tne purposes for which it is 
intended. The legs are either made into hams, or slightly 
salted for a few days and boiled; they are also sometimes r(»sted 
when the pork is not l^ge nor coarse, with a savoury forcemeat 
inserted between the skin and flesh of the knuckle. The part 
of the shoulder called the hand is also occasionally pickl^ in 
the same way as hams and bacon, or it may be salted and boiled, 
but it is too sinewv for roasting. After these and the head have 
been taken off, the remainder, without farther divisioa than 
being split down the back, may be converted into whole side^ 



CttiP.XI.] FORK. 237. 

or flitches^ as they al% usually called, of bacon ; but when the 
meat is large, and required in part for various other purposes, a 
chine may be taken out, and the fat pared off the bones of the 
libs and loins for bacon ; the thin part of the body converted 
into pickled pork, and the ribs and other bones roasted, or made 
into pies or sausages. The feet, which are generally salted down 
for immediate use, are excellent if laid for two or three weeks 
into the same pickle as Jbhe hams, then well covered with cold 
vater, and slowly boiled until tender. 

The loins of young and delicate pork are roasted with the 
skin on ; and this is scored in regular stripes of about a (]^uarter- 
Bich wide with the point of a sharp knife, before the jomts are 
laid to the fire. The skiu of the leg also is just cut through in 
the same manner. This is done to prevent its blistering, and to 
i^der it more easy to carve, as the skin (or crackling) becomes 
90 crisp and hard m the cooking, that it is otherwise sometimes 
difficult to divide it. 

To be at any time fit for table, pork must be perfectly sweety 
snd thorough^ cooked ; great attention also should be given 
to it when it is in pickle, fir if any part of it be long exposed to 
the air, without bemg turned into, or well and frequently basted 
irith the brine, it w3l often become tainted during the process 
of coring it. 

TO MELT XJlSB. 

Strip the skin from the inside fat of a freshly killed and well<< 
fed pig; slice it small and thin; put it into a new or well-scalded 
jv, set it into a ^n of boiling water, and let it simmer over a 
clear fire. As it dissolves, strain it into small stone lars, or deep 
earthen pans, and when perfectly cold, tie over it the skin that 
^^ cleared from the ImxI, or bladders which have been thoroughly 
Washed Mid wiped very dry. Lard thus prepared is extremely 
pure in flavour, and keeps perfectly well, if stored in a cool 
place ; it may be used with advantage in making pastry, as well 
as for frying fish, and for various other purposes. It is better to 
keep the last drainings of the fat apart from that which is first 
poured off, as it will not be quite so fine in quality. 

TO PRSSEBVE UNMELTED LASD FOB MANY MONTHS. 

For the particular uses to which the leaf-fat, or fleed, can be 
advantageously applied, see fleed-crust, Chapter XVI. It mav 
be kept well durmg the summer months by rubbing fine salt 
rather plentifully upon it when it is first taken from the pig, 
and leaving it lor a couple of day^ ; it should then be well 
dfsined, and covered wiu a strong brine: this, in warmer

/ the bodv about hilf 
a pint of fine bread- 
crumbs, mixed with 
three heaped lea- 
Bpoonsfiil of nge, 
minced very email, three ounces of good batter, a large saitqwon- 
ful of salt, and two thirda as much of pepper, or some cayenne- 
Sew it up with soft, but strong cotton, tnua it as a hare, with 
the fore legs skewered back, and the hind ones forward; lay it 
to a strong, clear fire, but keep it at a moderate distance, as it 
would quickly blister or scorch, if placed too near. So soiffl tie 
it lias become warm, rub it with abit of butter, tie it in a fold of 
mualin, or of 'l"" cloth, and repeat this process conslADtly while 
it is roasting. When the gravy begins to drop from it, put 
basins, or Bmall deep tureens under, to catch it in. As soon as 
the pig is of a fine light ember brown, and the steam draws 
strongly towards the fire, wipe it quite dry with a clean clotti, 
and rub a bit of cold butler over it. wten it is half done, » 
pig iron, or in lieu of this, a large flat iron should be hung in 
the centre of the grate, or the middle of the pig will be oone 
long before the ends. When it is ready for table, lay it into s 
very hot dish, and before the spit is withdrawn, talre ofi' t^ 
open the head, and split the body in two; chop tt^etber quicklj

still prefer the old-fashioned cuirant sauce to any other ; and 
nmj haye the brains and stuffing stirred into rich melted but-

nsaallj been so much approved, that we can recommend it with 
some confidenoe, as it. stands. Modem taste would perhaps be 
nther in favour of rich brOwn gravy and thick tomata sauce, or 
saace Poivrade. 

In dishing the pig, lay the body flat in the middle, and the 
head and ears at the ends and sides. When very pure oil can 
be obtamed, it is preferable to butter for the basting : it should 
be laid on with a bunch of feathers. A suckling of three weeks 
old is considered as best suited to the ^it; and it should always 
be dressed, if-possible, the day it is killed.

BAKED FIG. 

Prepare the pig exactly as for roasting, truss, and place it in 
the dish in which it is to be sent to the oven, and anoint it 
thickly in every part with white of egg which has been slightly 
beaten : it will require no basting, nor Airther attention of any 
^d} and will be well crisped by this process. 

FIG A. LA TABTABE. 

When the shoulders of a cold roast pig are left entire, take 
them off with care, remove the skin, trim them into good form, 
dip them into clarified butter or very pure salad oil, then into 
^ crumbs highly seasoned with cayenne and mixed with about 
^ half-teaspoonful of salt. Broil them over a clear brisk. fire, 
^ send them quickly to table, as soon as they are heated 
through and equally browned, with tomata sauce, or sauce 
Robert. Curried crumbs and a currie-sauce will give an ex* 
cellent variety of this dish ; and savoury herbs, with two or 
three eschalots chopped small together and mixed with the 
bread-crumbs, and brown eschalot sauce to accompany the 
broil, will likewise be an acceptable one to many tastes. 

SUCKING PIG EN BLANaUETTE. (eNTBIBB.) 

Haise the flesh from the bones of a cold roast pig, free it from 
the crisp outer skin or crackling, and cut it down into small 
handsonae slices. Dissolve a bit of butter the size of an egg, 
^d, if tiiey can be easily procured, throw in a handful of button- 
mnshrooms, cleaned and sliced; shake these over the fire for 
three or four minutes, then stir to them a dessertspocmM of 
floor, and continue to shake or toss them gently, but do not 



S40 MODERN COOKERY. [cHAP* XL 

allow tbtoi to brown. Add a small bunch of patsley, a bay- 
lea^ a middling-sized blade of mace, some salt, a small quantity 
of cayenne or white pepper, half a pint of good veal or beef 
broth, and from two to tnree glasses of light white vnne. Let 
these boil gently until reduced nearly one third ; take out the 
parsley and mace, lay in the meat, and brinff it slowly to the 
point of simmering ; stir to it the beaten yolks of three firesh 
eggs, and the strained juice of half a lemon* Serve the blan- 
quette very hot. 

TO KOAST FOBK. 

When the skin is left on the joint which is to be roasted, it 
must be scored in narrow strips of equal width, before it is put to 
the fire, and laid at a considerable distance from it at first, that 
the meat may be heated through before the skin hardens or 
begins to brown ; it must never stand still for an instant, and 
the bastmg should be constant. Pork is not at the present day 
much served at very eood tables, particularly in this form; and 
it is so still less with the old savoury stuffing of sage and onions, 
though some eaters like it always with the leg : when it is 
ordered for this joint, therefore, prepare it as directed fer a 
goose, at page 146, and after having loosened the skin from the 
knuckle, msert as much as can well be secured in it. A little 
clarified butter, or salad oil may be brushed over the skin quite 
at first, particularly should the meat not be very fat, but unless 
remarkably lean, it will speedily yield sufficient dripping to 
baste it with. Joints from 'which the fat has been pued, will 
require of coibse far less roasting than those on which the 
crackling is retained. Brown gravy and apple or tomata sauce, 
are the usual accompaniments to all roasts of pork, except a 
sucking pig; they should always be thoroughly cooked. 

Leg of pork of 8 lbs., 3 hours; loin of from 5 to 6 Ibs^ 
with the skin on, 2 to 2^ hours; spare-rib of 6 to 7 Ibs^ 
Ij^ hour, 

TO KOAST A SADDLE OF PORK. 

The skin of this joint may be removed entirely, but if left oa 
it must be scored lengthwise, or in the direction in which it will 
be carved. The pork should be young, of fine quality, and of 
moderate size. Roast it very carefully, either by the directioiB 
given in the preceding receipt, or when the skin ia taken o£^ by 
those for a saddle of mutton, allowing in the latter case from 
three quarters of an hour to a full hour more of the fire for tt 
in proportion to its weight. Serve it with good htown g»V

Cut them about half an inch thick from a delicate loin of 
pork, trim them into neat form, and take off part of the fat, or 
the whole of it when it is not liked; dredge a little pepper or 
cayenne upon them, and broil them over a dear and moderate 
fire from fifteen to eighteen minutes, sprinkle a little fine salt 
ypon them just befcxre they are dished. They may be dipped 
into egg and then into bread-cnunbs mixed with minced sage, 
then finished in the usual way. When Med, flour them well,

COBBETT^S BECEIFT FOB CCBINO BACOH. 

(Extracted from his ^ Cottage Economy r) 

^ All Other parts being taken away, the t^o sides that remain, 
and which are called^ttoAe^, are to be cured for bacon. Th^ 
are first rubbed with salt on their inside, or flesh sides, then 
placed one on the other, the flesh sides uppermost in a salting 
trough, which has a gutter round its edges to drain away the 
brine; for to have sweet and fine bacon, the flitches must not 
be sopping in brine, which gives it the sort of taste that burrel- 
pork and sea-junk have, and than which nothing is more 
villainous. Everv one knows how different is the taste of fr^ 
dry salt from tnat of salt in a dissolved state. Therefore, 
change the salt often ; once in four or five days. Let it melt 
and smk in, but let it not lie too long. Change the flitches, put 
that at bottom which was first on the top. Do this a couple of 
times. This mode will cost you a great deal more in salt than 
the sopping mode ; but without it your bacon will not be so 
sweet and fine, nor keep so welL As to the time required for 
making the flitches sufficiently salt, it depends on circumstances; 
the thickness of the flitch, the state of the weather, the place 
wherein the salting is going on. It takes a longer time lor a 
thick than for a thin flitch ; it takes longer in dry than in 
damp weather, it takes longer in a dry than in a damp place. 
Bat for the flitches of a hog of five score, in weather not very 
dry or very damp, about six weeks may do; and as yours is to 
be /a/, which receives little injury from over-salting, give time 
enough ; for you wet to have bacidn till Christmas comes again.

alwa3n9 admit of a free circnlation of air; confined air, thoogh 
cool, will taint meat sooner than the mid-day sun accompanied 
with a breeze. With regard to smoking the bacon, two pre- 
cautions are necessary: first to hang the flitches where no rain 
comes down upon them, and next, that the smoke must proceed 
from wood, not peat, turf^ nor coal. Ab to the time that it 
requires to smoke a flitch, it must depend a good deal upon 
whether there be a constant fire beneath, and whether the fire 
be large or small. A month will do if the fire be pretty 
constant, and such as a fann house fire usually is. But over- 
smoking, or rather, too long hanging in the air, makes the 
bacon ru«/. Great attention should, therefore, be paid to this 
matter. The flitch ousht not to be dried up to the nardnesB of 
a board, and yet it ouent to be perfectly dry. Before you hang 
it up, lay it on the floor, scatter the flesh-side pretty thickly 
over with bran or with some fine saw-dust, not of ileal or fir. 
Rub it on the flesh, or pat it well down upon it. This keeps 
the smoke from gettinff into the little openings, and makes a 
sort of crust to be dfied on. 

^^To keep the bacon sweet and good, and fr*ee firom hopperif 
sift fine some clean and dry wood-ashes. Put some at the Ixrttom 
of a box or chest long enough to hold a flitch of bacoa. Lay in 
one flitch ; and then put in more ashes, then another flitch, and 
cover this with six or eight inches of the ashes. The place 
where the box or chest is kept ought to be c&y, and should the 
ashes become damp they should be put in the fire-pkoe to 
dry, and when cold, put back again. With these precautions 
the bacon will be as good at the aid of the year as on the firA 
day." 

Obs, — ^Although the preceding directions for curing the bacon 
are a little vague as regards the proportions of salt and pork, 
we think those for its after-management will be acceptable to 
many of our readers, as in our damp climate it is ofren a matter 
of great difficulty to preserve hams and bacon through the year 
from rust.

more particularly exposed. Before the salt is added to the meat, ( 
vann it a little before the fire, and use only a part of it in the 
first instance ; then, as it dissolves, or is al)sorbed by the meat, 
add the remainder at several diflerent times. Let the meat in 
tiie mean while lie either on clean straw, or on a cold brick or 
stone floor : it will require from a fortnight to three weeks* 
curing, aooording to the state of the atmosphere. When done, 
han^ it in a cool dry place, where there ft a thorough current 
of air, and let it remain there imtil it is perfectly dry, when the 
salt will be found to have crystallized upon the simace. The 
meat may then be removed to your store, and kept in a close 
chest, sorrounded with clean outer straw. If very large, the 
hams will not be in perfection in less than twelve months from 
the time of their being stored.**

KENTISH MODE OF CUTTING UP AND CURING A PIO. 

To a porker of sixteen stone Kentish weight, (that is to say, 
eight pounds to the stone, or nine stone two pounds of common 
weight), allow two gallons of salt, two pounds of saltpetre, one 
pound of coarse sugar, and two pounds of bay-salt, well dried 
and reduced to powder. Put aside the hams and cheeks to be 
cored by themselves ; let the feet, ears, tail, and eye-parts of 
the head be salted for immediate eating. The blade-bones, and 
ends of the loins and ribs reserved for sausage-meat should it be 
wanted, and the loin and spare-ribs for roasting. Divide and 
salt the remainder thus : Mix well together the «Jtpetre, sugar, 
and bay-salt, and rub the pork gently with them in every part ; 
cover the^bottom of the picklins tub with salt, and pack in the 
pork as closely as possible, with a portion of the remaining salt 
between each layer. A very little water is sometimes sprinkled 
in to facilitate the dissolving of the salt into a brine, but this is 
better avoided, if possible^ and in damp weather will not be 
needed. If in a fortnight it should not have risen, so as almost 
entirely to cover the meat, boil a strong brine of salt, saltpetre, 
sugar, and bay-salt ; let it remain till perfectly cold, and then 
pour it over the ^ pork. A board, with a heavy stone weight

Upon it, should be kept upon the meat, to force it down undet 
the brine. In from three to four months it will be fit to table, 
and will be delicate and excellent pickled pork.

weight, or nine stone two pounds of common weight, or fi>iirteen 
pounds to the stone) ; common salt, 2 gallims ; raltpetre, 2 lbs. ; 
coarse sugar, 1 lb. ; bay-salt, 2 lbs. 

FRENCH BACON FOR lABBING. 

Cut the bacon from the pig with as little lean to it as possible. 
Bub it well in every part, with salt which has been dried, 
reduced to powder, and sifted ; put the layers of bacon close 
against and upon each other, in a shallow wooden trongh, and 
set in a cool, but noi a damp cellar ; add more salt all round 
the bacon, and lay a board, with a very heavy weight up(m it 
Let it remain for six weeks, then hang it up in a dry and aii7 
place. 

Pork, 14 lbs. ; salt, 14 ozs. : 6 weeks. 

TO PICKLE CHEEKS OF BACON AND HAMS. 

One pound of comm'on salt, one pound of the coarsest sogar, 
and one oimce of saltpetre, in fine powder, to each stone (firarteen 
pounds) of the meat will answer this purpose extremely well. 
An ounce of black pepper can be added, if liked, and when less 
sugar is preferred, tne proportion can be diminished one halt 
and the quantity of salt as much increased. Bacon also may be 
cured by this receipt, or by the Bordyke one for hams. A 
month is sufficient tune for the salting, unless the pork be veiy 
large, when five weeks must be allowed'for a ham. The ingre- 
dients may be well mixed, and aU applied at the same time. 

To each 14 lbs. of pork, salt, 1 lb. ; coarse su^ar, 1 lb. ; salt* 
petre, 1 oz. ; pepper (if used), 1 oz. : 4 to 5 weeks. 

HAMS SUFEBIOB TO WESTPHAUA.

Od, — Such of our readers as shall make trial of this ad* 
mirable receipt, will acknowled^, we doubt not, that the hams 
thus cured are in reaUty supenor to those of Westphalia. It 
was originally giyen to the public by the celebrated French 
on^ Monneur Ude, to whom, after haying proved it, we are 
iiappy to acknowledge our obligation for it. He directs that^ 
the hams when smoked should be hung as high as possi- 
ble fixxm the fire, that the &t mav not be melted; a very 
necessary precaution, as the mode of their being cured renders 
it peculiarly liable to do so. This, indeed, is somewhat per- 
ce^ble in the cooking, which ought, therefore, to be con* 
dacted with especial care. The hiuns should be very softly 
simmered,* and not ov^r-done. They should be large, and of 
finely-fed pork, or the receipt will not answer. We give the 
result of our first trial of it, which was perfectly successftil.

Obs, — When two hams are pickled together a smaller pro- 
portion of the ingredients is required for each, than for one 
which is cured by itself. 

HAMS. 

(JBordyhe Receipt^ 

After the hams have been rubbed with salt, and well drained 
from the brine, according to our previous directions, take, for 
each fourteen pounds weight of the pork, one ounce of saltpetre 
in fine powder, mixed with three ounces of the coarsest sugar ; 
mb the meat in every part with these, and let it remain some 
hours, then cover it well with eight ounces of bay-salt, dried and 
pounded, and mixed with four ounces of common salt : in four 
days add one pound of treacle, and keep the hams turned daily, 
and well basted with the pickle for a month. Hang them up 
to drain for a night, fold them in brown paper, and send them 
to be smoked for a month. An ounce of ^ound black pepper 
is often mixed, with the saltpetre in this receipt, and three

TO BOIL A HAM. 

The degree of soaking which must be given to a ham before 

it is boiled, must depend both on the manner in which it has 

been cured, and on its a^. If highly salted, hard, and old, a 

day and night, or even longer, may be requisite to dilate tiie 

pores sufficiently, and to extract a portion of the salt To do 

either effectually the water must be several times changed 

during the steeping. We generally find hams cured by any of 

the receipts which we have given in this chapter quite enough 

soaked in twelve hours ; and they are more frequently laid into 

water only early in the morning of the day on which they are 

boiled. Those pickled by Monsieur I7de*s receipt need much 

less steeping than any others. After the ham has been scraped, 

or brushed, as clean as possible, pare away lightly any part 

which, from being blackened or rusty, would disfigure it; 

though it is better not to cut the flesh at all unless it he really 

requisite for the good appearance of the joint. Lay it into a 

ham-kettle, or into any other vessel of a similar form, and 

cover it plentifully with cold water ; bring it vert/ slowly tndeed 

to boil, and clear off carefUlly the scum which will be thrown 

up in sreat abundance. So soon as the water has been cleared 

from this, draw back the pan quite to the edge of the stove, that 

the ham may be simmered sonly, but steadily, until it is tender. 

On no account allow it to bou fast. A bunch of herhs and 

three or foui: carrots, thrown in directly after the water has

ings over it, or grate a hard-toasted crust, or sift upon it the 
prepared bread of page 129, unless it is to be glazed, when 
neiuier of these must be used. 

Small ham, 3^0 4 hours; moderate sized, 4 to 4| hours; 
very large, 5 to 5^ hours. 

Obs, — ^We have seen the following manner of boiling a nam 
recommended, but we have not tried it : — " Put into the wa**^

jinegar, a larse bunch of sweet herbs, and a bay leaf. When it 
is two thirds done, skin, cover it with raspings, and set it in an 
oven until it is done enough : it will prove incomparably supe- 
lior to a ham boiled in the nsnal way.** 

FRENCH RECEIPT FOR BOIIJNO A HAM, 

After having soaked, thoroughly cleaned, and trimmed the 
ham, pnt over it a little very sweet dean hay, and tie it up in 
a thm doth ; place it in a nam kettle, a braising pan, or any 
other vessel as nearly of its size as can be, and cover it with two 
parts of cold water, and one of light white wine (we think the 
leader will perhaps find eider a good substitute for this) ; add, 
when it boils and nas been skimmed, four or five carrots, two or 
three onions, a large bunch of savoury herbs, and the smallest bit 
of garlic. Let the whole simmer gently from four to five hours, or 
longer should the ham be very large. When perfectly tender, 
lift it out, take off the rino, and sprinkle over it some fine 
crpmbs, or some raspings of bread mixed with a little finely 
nuDoed parsley. 

TO BAKE A HAM. 

Unless when too salt, from not being sufficiently soaked, a 
^ (particularly a young and fresh one) eats much better 
haked than boiled, and remains longer good. The safer plan is 
to lay it into plenty of cold water over night. The following 
% soak it for an hour or more in warm water, wash it deli- 
<^ly dean, trim smoothly off all rusty parts, and lay it with 
the rind downwards into a coarse paste rolled to about an inch 
^ck ; moisten the edges, draw, pmch them together, and fold 
them over on the upper side of the ham, taking care to close 
^^ so that no gravy can escape. Send it to a well-heated, 
but not a fierce oven. A very small ham will require quite 
^hree hours baking, and a large one five. The crust and the 
^ must be removed while it is hot. When part only of a 
iiam is dressed, this mode is better far than boiling it. 

TO BOIL BACOH. 

When very highly salted and dried, it should be soaked for 
IQ hour b^ore it is dr^teed. Scrape and wash it well, cover it 
plentifiilly with cold water, let it both heat and boil slowly, 
i^CQu>ve all the scum with care, and when a fork or skewer will

it be at band, nse for tbe purpose the bread reoommended at 
pfljge 129, then dry it a little before the fire, or set it for a few 
minutes into a. gentle oven. Bacon requires Icmg boiling, bat 
the precise time depends upon its quality, the flesh of youog 
porkers becoming tender much sooner than that of older ones; 
sometimes, too, the manner in which the animal has been fed 
renders the meat hard, and it will then, unless thoroughly 
cooked, prove very indigestible. From ten to fifteen mmntes 
less for tne pound, must be allowed for unsmoked bacon, or for 
pickled pork. 

Smoked bacon (striped), 2 lbs., from 1^ to 1 1 hour ; unsmdced 
bacon, or pork, 1 to !;( hour. 

Obg. — The thickest part of a large ganunon of bacon will 
require from twenty to thirty minutes longer boiling than tbe 
thinner side. 

BACON BBOILED OB FBIED. 

Cut it evenly in thin slices, or rashers^ as they axe genenHy 
called, pare from them all rind and rust, curl them round, fieten 
them with small slight skewers, then fry, broil, or toast them 
in a Dutch oven ; draw out the skewers before they are sent to 
tiible. A few minutes will dress them either way. They may 
also be cooked without being curled. The rind should alvrayste 
taken off, and the bacon gently toasted, grilled, or fried, tint it 
may be well done without being too much dried, or hardened : 
it should be cut thin, 

BBESSED BASHEBS OF BACOH. 

'Slice rather thicker than for frying, some cold boiled baooo, 
and strew it lightly on both sides with fine raspings of bread, 
or with a grated crust which has been very slowly and gradually 
toasted until brown quite through. Toast or warm the rash- 
ers in a Dutch oven, and serve them with veal cutlets, or any 
other delicate meat. The bacon thus dressed is much nicer 
than when broiled or fried without the previons boiling.

And &et, and boil them for about an hour and a half; bone the 
feet while they are warm, and trim the gristle from the large 
ends of the ears. When these are ready, mix a large grated 
nntmeg with a teaspoonful and a half of mace, half a teaspoon- 
M of cayenne, and as much of cloves. Wash, but do not soak 
the head ; wipe and flatten it on a board ; cut some of the flesh 
fix)m the thickest parts, and (when the whole of the meat has 
been seasoned eqixally with the spices) lay it on the thinnest ; 
intermis it with that of the ears and feet, roll it up very tight, 
and bind it firmly with broad tape ; fold a thin pudding-cloth 
quite closely round it, and tie it securely at both ends. A 
braising-pan, firom its form, is best adapted for boiling it, but if 
there be not one at hand, place the head in a vessel adapted to 
its size, with the bones and trinmiings of the feet and ears, a 
large bunch of savoury herbs, two moderate-sized onions, a 
small head of celery, three or four carrots, a teaspoonful of pep- 
percorns, and sufficient cold water to cover it well ; boil it very 
^tly for four hours, and leave it until two parts cold in the 
liquor in which it iVas boiled. Take off the cloth, and put the

minced eschalots can be mixed with the meat for those who 
like their flavour. 

SAUSAGES. 

Common farm-house sausages are made with nearly equal 
parts of fat and lean pork, coarsely chopped, and seasoned with 
salt and pepper only. They are put mto skins (which have 
previously been turned inside out, scraped very thin, wafijhed 
with exceeding nicety, and wiped very dry), then twisted into 
links, and should be hung in a cool airy larder, when th^ will 
remain good for some time. Odd scraps and trinunings of pork 
are usually taken for sausage-meat when the pig is killed and 
cut up at home ; but the chine and blade-bone are preferred in 
general for the purpose. The pork rinds, as we have already 
stated,* will make a strong and almost flavourless jelly, which 
may be used with excellent eflect for stock, and which, with the 
addition of some pork-bones, plenty of vegetables, and some 
dried ^as, will make a very nutritious soup for those who do 
not object to the pork-flavour which the bones will give. Hatf 
an ounce of salt, and nearly or quite a quarter-ounce of pepper 
will sufficiently season each pound of the sausage-meat. 

BIENTISH SAUSAGE-MEAT, 

To three pounds of lean pork, add two of fat, and let both 
be taken clear of skin. As sausages are lighter, though not so 
delicate when the meat is somewhat coarsely chopped, this 
difierence should be attended to in making tnem. When the 
fat and lean are partially mixed, strew over them two ounces 
and a half of dry salt, beaten to powder, and mixed with one 
ounce of ground black pepper, and three large tablespoon^ 
of sage, very finely minced. Turn the meat with the chopping 
knife, imtil the in^edients are well blended. Test it before it 
is taken ofl* the block, by frying a small portion, that if more 
seasoning be desired, it may at once be added. A fiill-sized 
nutmeg, and a small dessertspoonful of pounded maoe, would, 
to many tastes, improve it. This sausage-meat is usually

Turkeys, as we have stated in oar receipts for them, are very 
tongh and poor eating if not sufficiently long kept -A goose, 
also, in winter, should hang some days before it is dressed, and 
fowls, likewise, will be improved by it. 

All kinds of poultry should be thoroughly cooked, thougli 
without being overdone, for nothing in general can more 
effectually destroy the appetite than the taste and appearance 
of their nesh when brought to table half roasted or booled. 

TO BONE A FOWL OS TURKEY WITHOUT OPEIUNG H. 

After the fowl has been drawn and singed, wipe it inside and 
out with a clean cloth, but do not wash it. Take off the head, 
cut through the skin all round the first joint of the legs, and 
pull them from the fowl, to draw out the large tendons. Raise 
the flesh first from the lower part of the back-bone, and a 
little also from the end of the breast-bone, if necessary; work 
the knife gradually to the socket of the thigh ; with the point of 
the knife detach the joint from it, take the end of the bone 
firmly in the fingers, and cut the flesh clean from it down to the 
next joint, round which pass the point of the knife carefully, and 
when the skin is loosened from it in every part, cut round the 
next bone, keeping the edge of the knife close to it, until the 
whole of tiie leg is done. Kemove the bones of the other leg in 
the same manner; then detach the flesh frt)m the back and 
breast-bone sufficiently to enable you to reach the upper joints 
of the wings; proceed with these as with the legs, but be 
especially car^u not to pierce the skin of the second joint : it 
is usual to leave the pimons unboned, in order to give more 
easily its natural form to the fowl when it is dre^ed. The 
merry^thought and neck-bones may now easily be cut away, the 
back and side-bones taken out without being divided, and the 
breast-bone separated carefully from the flesh (which, as the 
work procuresses, must be turned back from the bones upon the 
fowl, untu it is completely inside out). After the one remaining 
bone is removed, draw the winss and legs back to their proper 
form, and turn the fowl the rignt side outwards. 

A turkey is boned exactly in the same manner, but as it 
requires a very large proportion of forcemeat to fill it entireljt 
the legs and wings are sometimes drawn into the body, to 
diminish the expense of this. K very securely trussed, and 
sewn, the bird may be either boiled, or stewed in rich gravy, M 
well as roasted, after being boned and forced. 



CHAP. XII.3 POULTRY. 255 



ASrOTHES VODB OT BONING ▲ FOWL OB TUBKET. 

Cat through the skin down the centre of the back, and raise 
the flesh careftdly on either side with the point of a sharp 
bife, until the sockets of the wings and thishs are reacheo. 
Till a little practice has been gained, it. will perhaps be better to 
bone these joipts before proceeding further ; but after they are 
once detached from it, the whole of the body may easiiy be 
separated from the flesh and taken out entire : only the neck- 
bones and merrythought will then remain to be removed. The 
bird thus pr^tared may either be restored to its original form, 
by filling the legs and wings with forcemeat, and the body with 
toe livers of two or three fowls, if they can be procured, mixed 
with alternate layers of parboiled tongue, freed from the rind, 
fine sausage meat, or yeal forcemeat, or thin slices of the nicest 
bacon, or aught else of good flavour, which will give a marbled 
appearance to the fowl when it is carved ; and then be sewn up 
^ trussed as usual; or the legs. and wings may be drawn 
inside the body, and the bird being first flattened on a table maybe 
covered with sausage meat, and the various other ingredients we 
have named, so placed that it shall be of equal thickness in 
every part ; then tightly rolled, bound firmly together with a 
fillet of broad tape, wrapped in a thin pudding-doth, closely 
tied at both ends, and dr^sed as follows : — Put it into a braising- 
pan, stewpan, or thick iron saucepan, bright in the inside, and 
ntteid as nearly as may be to its size ; add all the chicken bones, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, two carrots, two bay-leaves, a large 
blade of mace, twenty four white peppercorns, and any trim- 
nungs or bones of unc&essed veal which may be at hand ; cover 
the whole with good veal-broth, add salt, if needed, and stew 
it venr softly, from an hour and a quarter to an hour and 
a half ; let it cool in the liquor in which it was stewed ; and 
a^r it is lifted out, boil down the gravy to a jelly and strain it ; 
let it become coldf clear off the fat, and serve it cut into large 
^ or roughed, and laid round the fowl, which is to be served 
eold. If restored to its form, instead of being rolled, it must be 
^wed gently for an hour, and may then be sent to table hot, 
covered with mushroom, or any other good sauce that may be 
preferred ; or it may be left until the following day, and served 
garnished with the jelly, which should be firm, and very clear 
and well-flavoured : the liquor in which the cairs foot has been 
boiled down, added to the broth, will sive it the necessary 
d^rce of consistency. French cooks add three or four onions

sages is still often placed in the dish, round a turkey, as a 
garnish. 

It is usual to fold and &sten a sheet of buttered writing paper 
over the breast to prevent its being too much coloured : this 
should be removed twenty minutes before the bird is done. 
The forcemeat of chestnuts (No. 15, Chapter VI.) may be very 
advantageously substituted for the commoner kinds in stuffing 
it, and the body may then be filled with chestnuts, previoiisly 
stewed until tender m rich gravy, or simmered over a slow fire in 
plenty of rasped bacon, wim a high seasoning of mace, nutmeg, 
and cayenne, until they are so ; or, instead of this, weil-ms^

Obs,—A turkey should be laid at first far from the fire, and 
drawn nearer when half done, though never sufiidently so to 
Rcorch it ; it should be well roasted, for even the most inveterate 
advocates of under-dressed meats will seldom tolerate the taste 
or sight of partially-raw poultry. 

TO BOIL A TUBK£T. 

A delicate but plump hen- 
turkey of moderate size should 
be selected for boiling. Pick

of the l^s, and draw them off: this is best accomplished by 
fastening the feet to a strong hook, and then pulling the bii^i 
away mm. it. Wash it ezoe^ngly clean, and tnen wipe it dry ; 
fill the breast with the forcemeat No, 1 or 2 of Chapter YL, or 
with the oyster, chestnut, or French forcemeat, of which the 
receipts are given in the same chapter. In trussing it draw the 
legs mto the body, break the breast-bone, and give the turkey 
as round and plump an appearance as can be. Put it into 
plenty of tparm water, clear off the scum vrith the greatest oare 
as it is thrown to the sur&ce, and boil the bird very gently from 
an hour and a half to two hours and a quarter. A very large 
turkey would require a longer time, but it is unsuited to this 
mode of cooking. When the oyster-forcemeat is used, a large 
tureen of rich oyster Sauce should accompany the dish; but 
celery sauce, or good white sauce, may otherwise be sent to 
table with it ; and a boiled tongue or a small ham is usually 
served in addition. JPor a plain family dinner, a delicate 
cheek of bacon is sometimes substituted for either of these, and 
parsley and butter for a more expensive sauce. Fast boiling 
will cause the skin of the bird to break, and must therefore 
be especially avoided : it should han^ for some days before it 
is dr^sed, for if quite freshly killed it will not be tender, but 
it must be perfeetty sweet to be fit for table. 

Moderate-sized turkey, U to 2 hours; large turkey, longer; 
very small one, less time.

TUBKET BONED AND FORCED. 

{An excellent dish,} 

Take a small, well-kept, but quite sweet hen-turkey, of from 
seven to eight pounds weight, and remove, by the receipt for a 
fowl (page 254), all the bones except those of the pinions, 
without opeiiinff the bird ; draw it into shape, and fill it entirely 
with ezceedingfy fine sausage meat, beginning with the legs and 
win^s; plump the breast well in preparing it, and when its 
onsmal form is quite restored, tie it securely at both ends, and 
at the extremities of the legs ; pass a slight iron skewer through 
these and the body, and another through the wings and body; 
then lay a twine over the back of the turkey, and pass it under 
the ends of the first skewer, cross it in the centre of the back, 
and pass it under the ends of the second skewer ; then carry it 
over the pinions to keep them firmly in their place, and &^n 
it at the neck. When a cradle spit, of which the engraving 
below shows the form, and which opens with a joint to receive the

roast, is not at hand, a bottle jack will be found more conve- 
nient than any other for holding the turkey ; and after the hook 
of this ifl passed through the neck, it must be further supported 
by a string running across the back and imder the points of the 
skewer which confines the pinions to the hook ; for, otherwise, 
its weight would most prolmbly cause it to fall. Flour it well, 
place it far from the fire until it is heated through, and baste it 
plentifully and incessantly with butter. An hour and three 
quarters will roast jt well. Break and boil down the bones for 
gravy in a pint and a half of water, with a little salt, a few 
slices of celery, a dozen corns of pepper, and a branch or two of 
parsley. Brown gently in a morsel of good butter, a couple of 
ounces of lean ham, add to them a slight dredge of fiour, and a 
little cayenne, and pour to th^m the broth from the bones, after 
it has boiled an hour, and been strained and skimmed ; shake 
the stewpan well round, and stew the gravy until it is wanted 
for table ; clear it entirelv from fat ; strain, and serve it very 
hot. An eschalot, .or half an onion may be browned with the 
ham when either is liked, but their flavour ia not, we think, 
appropriate with poultry.

The turkey maybe partially filled unth the forcemeat No. i 
or 3, of Chapter vl., and the sausage-meat may. then be placed 
on either side of it.

Bread sauce can be served with the bird, or not, at pleasure. 
It will be found an improvement to moisten the sausage- 
meat with one or two spoonsful of wate'r : it should be finely 
minced, well spiced, and mixed with herbs, when the common 
forcemeat is not nsed in addition. In preparing it a pound and 
a quarter of fat should be mixed with eadi pound of the lean. 

To give the turkey a very good appearance, the breast may be

TUBKJBT A JJL FLAMANDB, OB, DINDE POUDB^E. 

Prepare as for boiling a fine well-kept hen turkev; wipe the 
inside thoroughly with a dry cloth, but do not wash it ; throw 
in a little salt to draw out the blood, let it remain a couple of 
hours or more, then drain and wipe it again; next, rub the 
outside in every part with about four ounces of fine dry salt, 
mixed with a large tablespoonfiil of pounded sugar; rub the 
turkey well with these, and turn it every day for four days ; 
then fill it entirely with equal parts of choice sausage-meat, and of 
the crumb of bread soaked in boiling milk or cream, and wrung 
dry in a cloth ; season these with the grated rind of a large 
lemon, a small nutmeg, some mace, cayennCi and fine herbs, m 
the same proportion as for veal forcemeat (No. 1, page 143^. 
Sew the turkey up very securely, and when trussed, roll it m 
a cloth, tie it closely at both eni, and boil it very gently be- 
tween three and four hours. When taken up, sprinkle it thickly 
with fine crumbs of bread, mixed with plenty of parsley, shred 
extremely small. Serve it cold, with a sauce made of the strained 
juice and grated rind of two lemons, a teaspoonful of made- 
mustard, and one of pounded sugar, with as much oil as will pre- 
vent its being more than pleasantly acid, and a little salt, if 
needed ; work these together until perfectly mixed, and send 
them to table in a tureen.

had had the dish often served with «(reat success in Paris. We

have iiuerted it on her authority, not on onr own experience; 
but we think it may be quite depended on. 

TO SOA8T A 0006E. 

After it has been picked and singed with care, put into the body 

of the goose two parboiled onfons 
of moderate size, finely chopped, 
and mixed with half an ounce of 
minced sage-leayes, a saltspoonM 
of salt, and half as much bUck 
I>epper, or a proportionate quan- 
tity of cayenne ; to these add a 
GooM peadj for the Spit. gmall slice of fresh butter. Trass 

the goose, and after it is on the spit, tie it firmly at both ends 
that it may turn steadily, and that the seasoning may not 
escape ; roast it at a brisk fire, and keep it constantly basted. 
Serve it with brown grayy, and apple, or tomata sauce. When 
the taste ia in favour of a stronger seasoning than the above, 
wbdch occurs, we apprehend, but seldom, use raw onions for 
it, and increase the quantity; but should one stiU milder be 
preferred, mix a hancUul of fine bread-crumbs witii the other 
mgredients, or two or three minced apples. The body of a 
goose is sometimes filled entirely with mashed potatoes, which, 
for this purpose, ought to be boiled very dry, and veil 
blended witn two or three ounces of butter, or with some 
thick cream, some salt, and white pepper or cayenne: to 
these minced sage and parboiled onions can also be added at 
pleasure. A teiupoonful of made-mustard, half as much of 
salt, and a small portion of cayenne, smoothly mixedintha 
glass of port wine, are sometimes poured into the goose jnst 
before it is served, through a cut made in the apron.

Obs, — We extract, for the benefit of our readers, fi»m a 
work in our possession, the following passage, of which we 
have had no Qpportuni^ of testing the correctness. ^ Geese, 
with sage and onions, may be deprived of power to breathe 
forth any incense, thus: — Pare from a lemon all the yelbv 
rind, takmg care not to bruise the fruit nor to cut so deqily 
as to let out the juice. Place this lemon in the centre of i& 
seasoning within the bird. When or before it is brought to 
table, let the flap be gently opened, remove the lemon with a 
tablespoon; avoid breaking, and let it instantly be thrown 
awa;^, as its white pithy skin will have absorbed all the grosi 
particles which else womd have escaped.*'

Season the inside with a little pepper and salt, and rooGt the 
goose at a brisk fire from forty to fiify minutes. Serve it with 
good brown gravy only, and sorrel sauce. 

TO BOAST A FOWL. 

Strip off the feathen^ and carefoUy pick every stomp or plug 

firom the skin, as nothing can 
be more uninviting than the 
appearance of any kind of

n^lected, nor more indica-

body, but leave sufficient of the skin to tie over the part that 
is cut. In drawing the bird, do not open it more than is needfiil, 
and use great precaution to avoid breaking the gall-bladder. 
Hold the Tegs in boiling water for two or three minutes that the 
skin mav hs peeled from them easily ; cut off the daws, and 
then, with a bit of lighted writing-paper, singe off the hairs 
without blackening the fowl. Wash, and wipe it afterwards 
veiy dry, and let the liver and gizzard be made delicately 
dean, and fastened into the pinions. Truss, and spit it firmly ; 
flour it well when first laid to the fire, baste it freq[uently with 
butter, and when it is done, draw out the skewers, oish it, pour 
a little good gravy over, and send it to table with bread, 
mushroom, egg, chestnut, or olive sauce. A common mode of serv- 
ing roast fov^ in France is aux eressons^ that is, laid upon 
young water-cresses, which have previously been freed from 
the outer leaves, thoroughljr washed, shaken dry in a dean 
cloth, and sprinkled with a bttle fine adt, and a small quantity 
of vin^ar : these should cover the dish, and after the fowls are 
placed On them, gravy should be poured over as usual. 

The body of a fowl may be filled with very small mushrooms 
prepared as for partridges (see partridges with mushrooma), 
then sewn up, roasted, and served with mushroom-sauce : this is 
an excellent mode of dressing it. A slice of fresh butter mixed 
with some salt and cayenne or pepper ; a little rasped bacon ; or 
a bit or two of the lean of beef or veal minced, or cut into 
dice, may be put inside the bird when either is considered an 
improvement. An ounce or two of fresh butter smoothly mixed 
wiUi a teaspoonM of realfy good mushroom-powder, a little 



262 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XH. 

pounded mace, salt, and cayenne, will impart much more of 
flavour to the fowl. 

Full-sized fowl, 1 hour: young chicken, 25 to 35 minutes. 

Obs, — As we have already ob^rved in our general remarks 
on roasting, the time must be regulated by various drcum- 
stances, wmch we named, and which the cook should always 
take into consideration. A buttered paper shotdd be listened 
over the breast, and removed about mteen minutes before the 
fowl is served : this will prevent its taking too much cobur. 

BOAST FOWL. 

(^A French Recent,) 

Fill the breast of a fine fowl with good forcemeat, roast it as 
usual, and when it is veiy nearly ready to' serve take it from the 
fire, pour lukewarm butter over it in every part, and strew it 
thickly with very fine bread-crumbs ; sprinkle these again with 
butter, and dip the fowl into more crumbs. Put it down to the 
fire, and when it is of a clear, light brown all over, take it care- 
fully from the spit, dish, and serve it with lemon-sauce, and 
with gravy thickened and mixed with plenty of minced parsley, 
or wiUi brown gravy and any other sauce usually served with 
fowls. Savoury herbs shred small, spice, and lemon-grate, 
may be mixed with the crumbs at pleasure. Do not poor 
gravy over the fowl when it is thus prepared. 

TO ROAST A GUINEA FOWL. 

Let the bird hang for as many days as the weather will 
allow; then stuff, truss, roast, and serve it like a turkey, or 
leave the head on and lard the breast. Send gravy and bread- 
sauce to table with it in either case : it will be found ezoeUent 
eating.

FOWL 1 LA CASLSFOBT. (sHTBlb;.) 

Bone a fowl without opening the back, and restore it to its 
original form by filling the vacant spaces in the legs and wings 
with forcemeat ; put a roll of it also into the body, and a hu^ 
sausage on either side; tie it very securely at both ends, tmssit 
with fine skewers, and roast it for a frdl hour, keeping it basted 
plentifully with butter. When appearance is not re^uded, the 
pinions may be taken off, and the legs and wings drawn inside 
the fowl, which will then require a much smaller proportion of 
forcemeat :— that directed for veal (No. 1, page 143), will 
answer quite well in a general way, but for a dinner of cere-

minutes : they should be very gently boiled, and 
ed with great care as it gathers on the 
surface of the water. Eitiier of the following sauces may be 
sent to table with them : parglev and butter, bechamel, English 
white sauce, oyster, celery, or wnite-muahroom sauce. The fowls 
ire often dished with smBll tutU of delicately boiled cauliflowci 

t laced round them ; or with young vegetable marrow, scarcely 
irger than an egg, merely pared and halved after it is dressed : 
white sauce must be served with both of these. The livers and 
gizzards are not, at the present day, usually served in the 
wings of boiled fbwls. when they are not so, -the livers 
may be nmmered for four or five mmutes, then pressed to a

may penetrate every part equally ; the inside should be first 
laid towards it. l^e neck, feet, and gizzard may be boiled 
down with a small quantity of onion and carrot previously 
browned in a morsel of butter, to make the gravy; and the

FRICASSEED FOWLS OB CHICKENS. (eNTBI^.) 

To make a fricassee of good appearance without great expense, 
prepare, with exceeding nicety, a couple of pluinp chickens, 
strip off the skin, and carve them very neatly. Keserve the 
wings, breasts, merrythoughts, and thighs ; and stew dowu the 
inferior joints with a couple of blades of mace, a small bunch 
of savoury herbs, a few white peppercorns, a rant and a half of 
water, and a small half-teaspoonful of salt. When something 
more than a third part reduced, strain the gravy, let it cool, and 
skim off every particle of fat. Arrange the joints which are to 
be fricasseed in one layer, if it can be done conveniently, and 
pour to them as much of the gravy as will nearly cover them; 
add the very thin rind of half a nne fresh lemon, and simmer 
the fowls gently from half to three quarters of an hour; throw 
in sufficient salt, pounded nace, tma cayenne to give the sauce 
a good flavour, thicken it vdth a large teaspoonful of arrow-root, 
and stir to it the third of a pint of rich boiling cream ; then lift 
the stewpan from the fire, and shake it briskly round while 
the beaten yolks of three firesh eggs, mixed with a spoonfiil or 



CHAP, xnj POULTRY. 265 

two of eream, are added; continue to shake the pan gently 
aboye the fire till the sauce is just set, but it must not be al- 
lowed to boil, or it will curdle in an instant, 
i to f hour. 

CHICKEN CUTUBTS. (eNTB]^.) 

Skin, ancl cut into joints, one or two young chickens, and re- 
move the bones with care from the breasts, merrythoughts, and 
thighs, which are to be separated from the legs. Mix well 
together a teaspoonftd of salt, and nearly a fourth as much of 
Diace, a little grated nu^eg, and ca^nne; flatten, and form 
into good shape, the boned joints of chicken, and the flesh of the 
wings; rub a little of the seasoning over them in every part, dip 
them into beaten egg, and then into very fine bread-crumbs, and 
% them gently in firesh butter until thev are of a delicate brown. 
Some of the bones and trimmings may oe boiled down in half a 
pint of water, with a roll of lemon-peel, a little salt, and ei^ht 
or ten white peppercorns, to make the gravy, which, after bemg 
strained and cleared from fat, may be x)oured hot to some 
thickening made in the pan with a slice of fresh butter and a

would improve it greatly, and a small quantity of lemon-pickle 
or juice should be added before it is poured out, with salt and

{Freivoh Receipt} 

Take closely off the flesh of the breast and wing together, on 
either side of the bone, and when you have thus raised the large 
fi^ts^ as they are called, from three birds, which will give you 
but six cutlets, take the strips of flesh that lie under the wings, 
And that of the merrythoughts, and flatten two or three of these 
together, that you may have nine cutlets at least, of equal size. 
When aH are ready, fry to a pale brown as many diamond- 
shaped sippets of bread as there are fillets of fowl, and let them be

little clarified butter, and strew them in everv part with the 
finest bread-crumbs, moderately seasoned with salt, cayenne, 
snd poimded mace. Dissolve as much good butter as will be

This is an Indian dish. Cut up the chicken, wipe it dry, and 
rub it well with currie-powder, mixed with a little salt; fiyit 
in a bit of butter, taking care that it is of a nice light brown. 
In the mean time cut two or three onions into thin slices, draw 
them out into rings, and cut the rings into little bits, about half 
an inch long ; fry th^m for a long time gently in a little bit of 
clarified butter, until they have gndually dried up and are of a 
dehcate yellow-brown. Be careftd that they are not burnt, as 
the burnt taste of a single bit would spoU the flavour of the 
• whole. When they are as dry as cmps, without the least 
grease or moisture upon them, mix a httle salt with them, 
strew them over the med chicken, and serve up with lemon on 
a plate. 

We have extracted this receipt from a clever little work 
called the " Hand-Book of Cookery." 

HASHED FOWL. (eNTS^E.) 

" After having taken off, in joints, as much of a cold fowl, or 
fowls as will suffice for a dish, bruise the bodies with a naste 
roller, pour to them a pint of water, and boil them for an nour 
and a half to two hours, with the addition of a little pepper and 
salt only, or with a small quantity of onion, carrot, and herbs. 
Strain, and skim the fat from the gravy, put it into a clean 
saucepan, and, should it require thickening, stir to it, when it 
boils, half a teaspoonful of nour, smoothly mixed with a small 
bit of butter ; add a little mushroom catsup, or store-sauce, with 
a slight seasoning of mace or nutmeg. Lay in the fowl, and 
keep it near the fire until it is heated quite through,* and is ^ 
the point of boiling : serve it with fried sippets round the dish. 
For a hash of higher relish, add to the bones, when they are 
first stewed down, a large onion, minced and browned in butter, 
and before the fowl is dished, add some cayenne, and the juice 
of half a lemon. 

MINCED FOWL. (eNTBIIe.) 

{French Receipt.) 
Raise from the bones all the more delicate parts of the flesh 
of either cold roast, or cold boiled fowls, clear it from the skin, 
and keep it covered from the air, until wanted for use. Boil the 
bones, well bruised, and the skin, with three quarters or a pint 
of water, until reduced quite half, then strain the gravy and let

Bancepan, unth a quarter-pint of cream, an ounce and a half ci 
batter, well mixed with a dessertspoonful of flour, a little 
poonded mace, and grated lemon-rind; keep these stirred until 
they boil, then put in the fowl, finely minced, with three or four 
baid-boiled ^gs, chopped small, and sufiident salt, and white 
pepper, or cayenne, to season it properly. Shake the mince over 
the fire until it is just ready to hoil, stir to it quickly a saueeze of 
lemon juice, dish it with pale sippets of friea hread, ana serve it 
immediately. When cream cannot easily be obtained, use milk, 
with a double quantity of butter and fiour. The eggs may be 
omitted; the mmce may be warmed in good white sauce, and a 
border formed round it of leaves of pastry, fried or baked ; or it 
may be served in a vol^au^verU, roached eggs are sometimes 
bud over it, and a garnish of curled bacon is placed round the 
edge. Another excellent variety of tiie dish is also made by 
covering the fowl thickly with very fine bread-crumbs, mouten- 
ing them with clazified butter, and giving them colour with a 
s&bunander, or in a quick oven.* 

COLD FOWLS, EN FRITUSE. 

Cut mto joints, and take the skin from some cold fowls, lay 
them into a deep dish, strew over them a little fine salt and 
cayenne, add the juice of a lemon, and let them remain for an 
hour, moving ^em occasionally, that they may all absorb a 
portion of the acid ; then dip them one by one into some French 
batter (see page 129), and fry them a pale brown over a gentle 
fire. Serve them samished with very ^een crisped parsle^r. A 
few drops of eschsdot vinegar may be nuxed with the lemon-juice 
which is poured to the fowls, or slices of raw onion or eschalot, 
and small branches of sweet herbs may be laid amongst them, 
and cleared off before they are dipped into the batter. Gravy 
inade of the trimmings, thickened, and well flavoured, may be 
Knt to table with them in a tureen, and dressed bacon (see page 
248,) in a dish apart.

ing ike fillets, and slicing the scallops into the boiliDg sauce be- 
fore they have had time to cool. 
Fried, 3 to 4 minutes. 

GSILLADE OF COLD FOWLS. 

Carre and soak the remains of roast fowls as above, wipe 
them dry, dip them into clarified butter, and then into fine 
bread-crumbs, and broil them gently over a very clear fire. A 
little finely-minced lean of ham, or grated lemon-peel, with a 
seasoning of cayenne, salt, and mace, mixed with the crumbs, 
will vaiy this dish agreeably. When fried, instead of broiled, 
the fowls may be dipped into yolk of egg, instead of butter, but 
this renders them too dry for the gridiron. 

COLD FOWLS. 

(The Housekeeper's Receipt. A Supper Dish,) 

Cut very equally a sufficient number of slices from a cold 
ham, to form two or even three layers round the rim of the 
dish which is to be sent to table. Place the fowls, neatly carved 
and trimm^ in the centre, with some branches of curled pars- 
ley, or other light foliage amongst them. Cold tongue may be 
substituted for the ham with advantage. This dish has a band- 
some appearance, and is convenient for the purpose of quick 
serving. 

FOWLS k LA. MATONl^AISB. 

Carve with great nicety a couple of cold roast fowls ; phice 
the inferior joints, if they are served at all, dose together in the 
middle of a dish, and arrange the others round and over them, 
piling them as high as you can in the centre. Border the dish 
with the hearts of young lettuces cut in two, and hard-boiled 
eggs, halved lengthwise. At the moment of serving, x)our over 
the fowls a well-made mayonnaise sauce (see page 113), or, if 
preferred, a salad mixture, compounded with thick creaJoOi 
instead of oil.

seasoning of parboiled onions 
mixed with minced sage, salt, pepper, and a slice of butter, when 
this mode of dressing them is liked ; but as the taste of a whole 
party is seldom in its fi&your, one, when a couple are roasted, is 
often served without the stuffing. Gut off the pinions at the 
first joint from die bodies, truss the feet behind the backs, spit 
the hirds firmly, and roast them at a brisk fire, but do not place 
them sufiidently near to be scorched; baste them constantly, 
and when the breasts are well plumped, and the steam from 
them draws towards the fire, dish, and serve them quickly with 
a little good brown gravy poured round them, and some also in

STEwsn DUCK, (entb^e.) 

A couple of quite young ducks, or a fine, full-grown, but 
still tender one, vdll be required for this dish. Cut either down 
neatly into joints, and arrange them, in a single layer if possible, 
in a wide stewpan; pour in about three quarters of a pbit of 
strong, cold beef stock or gravy; let it be well cleared from 
scmnwhen it begins to boil, then throw in a little salt, a 
rather full seasoning of cayenne, and a few thin strips of lemon- 
rind. Simmer the ducks very softly for three quarters of an 
hour, or somewhat longer, should the joints be large ; then stir 
into the gravy a tablespoonful of the finest rice-flour, mixed 
with a wineglassM or rathet more of port wine, and a dessert- 
spoonful of lemon-juice : in ten minutes after, dish the stew 
and send it to table instantly. 

The ducks may be served with a small portion only of their 
sauce, laid in a circle, with green peas a la Francaise, heaped 
high in the centre ; the lemon-rind and port wine should then

be altogetlier omitted, and a small bmich of green omons sod 
parsley, with two or three young carrots, may be stewed dovn 
with the birds; or three or four minced eschalotB, delicately 
fried in batter, may be used to flavour the gravy. Tnimps 
au beurre^ prepared by the receipt of Chapter XV., may be 
substituted for the peas; and a well made Espagnole may take 
the place of beef stock, when a dish of high savour is wished for. 
A duck is often stewed without being divided into joints. It 
should then be firmly tnuEsed, half roasted at a quick fiie, and 
laid into the stewpan as it is taken from the spit; or well 
browned in some French thickening, then half covered with 
boilinff gravy, and turned when partially done : from an hour 
to anliour and a quarter will stew it well.

be ready in twelve hours for the spit, 
otherwise, in twenty-four. Takeoff

TO CHOOSE GAME. 

Buck venison, which is in season only from Jane to Michaelmas, 
is considered finer than doe venison, which comes into the mar- 
ket in October, an^ remains in season through November and 
Deeember : neither should be cooked at any other part of the 
year. The greater the depth of fat upon the haunch the better 
the quidity of the meat will be, provided it be clear and white, 
and the lean of a dark hue. If the cleft of the hoof, which is 
always left on the joint, be small and smooth, the animal is 
young; but it is old when the marks are the reverse of these.* 
Althoim;h the haunch is the prime and fiivourite joint of venison, 
the n&Si and shoulder are also excellent, stewed m various ways, 

* It mmt be obsenred that veniflon is not in perfection when young : like 
mutton. It leqniKS to be of a certain age before it is brought to table. The word 
cleft applies ako to the thickest part of the haunch, and it it the depth of the 
bt on tug which deddei the qualitj of the joint.

to bripg it into a fitting state for table without its becomii^ 
offensive. A free carrent of tkli- in a uirdcr is always a great 
advanta^ as it assists materiallj in presemng the sweetness of 
ereiy thmg which is kept in it, while a close &nip atmoapbere, 
OD the contrary, is more destructive of animal food of all iJnds 
eren than podtive heat. The fames of creosote are said to be 
an admirable preservative against putrescence, hut we hive not 
ourselves yet had experience of the feet All moisture Aould 



be wiped daily, or even more frequently, from the venison, with 
soft cloths, when any appears npon the surfece ; and ever; 
piecautioQ must be taken to keep off the flies, when the joint is 
not hung in a wire-safe. Bla« pepper thickly powdered od ii 
will genenillv answer the purpose : with common care, indeed, 
meat may always be protected from their attacks, and to leave 
it exposed to them in warm weather is altogether inexcosable in 
the cook. 

Hares and rabbits are stiff when freshly killed, and if ymag, 
the ears tear easily, and the claws are smootli and sharp. A 
b&re in cold weamer will remain, good from ten to fourtfcn 
days ; cai« only must he taken to prevent the inride fiwn 
becoming musty, which it will do if it nasbeen emptied in llie

by nearly the same tests as poultry : by opening the Inll, I^e 
sfaleneas will be detected easily if thev have been too lone I^P'- 
With few exceptions, game depends aunost entirely for tne W 
flavour and the tenderness of its fleeh, on the time which it is 
allowed to hang before it is cooked, audit is never good when 
very fresh ; but it does not fbilow that it should be sent » 
table in a really offensive state, for this is agreeable to few ealaj

^thont detriment. Wipe it with soft dry cloths wherever the 
slightest moisture appears on the sur&ce, and dnst it plentifully 
with freshly-ground pepper or pcjwdered ginger, to preserve it 
from the flies. The application of the pyroligneous or ascetic 
add would effectually protect it from these, as well as from the 
effects of the weather ; hut the joint must then he, not only well 
washed, hut soaked some considerahle time, and this would he 
injarious to it : the acid, therefore, should onlv he resorted to 
for the purpose of restoring to an eatahle state that which would 
otherwise he lost, from having heen kept heyond the point in 
^hich it is possihle to serve it. 

To prepare the venison for the spit, wash it slightly with 
tepid water, or merely wipe it thoroughly with dsump cloths, 
and dry it afterwards with clean ones ; then lay over the fat 
side a large sheet of thickly-huttered paper, and next a paste of 
floor and water ahout three quarters of an inch thick ; cover 
this again with two or three sheets of stout paper, secure the 
whole well with twine, and lay the haunch to a sound clear fire; 
haste the paper immediately with hutter, or clarified dripping, 
and roast the joint from three hours and a half to four and a 
half, according to its weight and quality. Doe venison .will 
i^nire half an hour less time than huck venison. Twenty 
minntes before the joint is done remove the paste and paper, 
haste the meat in every part with butter, and dredge it very 
lightly with flour; let it take a pale brown colour, and send 
H to table as hot as possible with unflavoured gravy in a tureen, 
and good currant jelly. It is not now customary to serve any 
other sauces with it; but should the old-fashioned sharp or 
sweet sauce be ordered, the receipt for it will be found at 
page 88.* 

3j to 4} hours. 

TO STEW A SHOTJLD^B OF VENISON. 

Bone the joint, by the directions given for a shoulder of veal 
or mutton {see page 206) ; flatten it on a table, season it well 
with cayenne, salt, and pounded mace, mixed with a very small 
proportion of allspice ; lay over it thin slices of the fat of a loin 
of well-fed mutton, roU and bind it tightly, lay it into a vessel 
nearly of its size, and pour to it as much good stock made with 
^ual parts of beef and mutton as will nearly cover it ; stew it 
as slowly as possible from three hours to three and a half (x

Di3i and serve it with a good Espagnole, made with part of the 
grayy in which it has been stewal; or thicken tins slightly 
with rice«flonr, mixed with a jglass or more of claret or of port 
wine, and as much salt and cayenne as will seaso^ the gravy 
properly* 

Some cooks soak the slices of mutton-&t in wine before they 
are laid upon the joint ; but no process of the sort will ever give 
to any kind of meat the true flavour of the Tenison, which to 
most eaters is far finer than that of the wine, and should aLwajrs 
be allowed to prevail over all the condiments with whidi it is 
dressed. Those, however, who care for it less than for a dish 
of high artificial savour, can have eschalots, ham, and carrot, 
lightly browned in good butter, added to the stew when it first 
begins to boil. 

H to 4 hours 

TO HASH VENISON.* 

For a superior hash of venison, add to three quarters of ft 
pint of strong thickened brown gravy, Christopher North's 
sauce, in the proportion directed ror it in the receipt of page 
110. Gut the venison in small thin slices of equal size, arrange 
them in a dean saucepan, pour the gravy on them, let them 
stand for ten minutes or more, then place them near the fire, 
and bring the whole very slowly to the point of boiling only: 
serve the hash immediately in a hot-water dish. 

For a plain dinner, when no gravy is at hand, break down 
the bones of the venison small, after the flesh has been cleared 
from them, and boil them with those of three or four undressed 
mutton-cutlets, a slice or two of carrot, or a few savoury herbs, 
and about a pint and a half of water or broth, until the hqaid 
is reduced quite one third. Strain it ofi^, let it cool, skim on all 
the fat, heat the gravy, thicken it when it boils with a dessert- 
spoonful or rather more of arrow-root, or with the brown roux 
of pa^e 96,* mix the same sauce with it, and finish it exactly as 
the richer hash above. It may be served on sippets of fM 
bread or not, at' choice.

After the hare has been skinned, or cased, as it is called, wash 
it very thoroughly in cold water, and afterwards in warm. If

standy laded over the hare, until it is nearly dried up, then 
add a large lump of butter, flour the hare, and continue the 
basting steadily until it is well browned; for unless this be 
done, and the roast be kept at a proper distance from the 
fire, the outside will become so dry and hard as to be quite 
uneatable. Serve the hare when done, with good brown gravy 
(of which a little should be poured round it in the dish), and 
with fine red currant jelly. This is an approved English me- 
thod of dressing it, but we would reconmiend in preference, 
tbat it should be basted plentifully with butter from the 
b^inning (the strict economist may substitute clarified beef- 
drippng, and finish with a small quantity of butter only) ; and 
tbatthe salt and water should be altogether omitted. First- 
fate cooks merely wipe the hare inside and out, and rub it with 
its own blood before it is laid to the fire ; but there is generally 
a rankness about it, especially after it has been many days 
knied, which, we should say, renders the washing indispensable,

(Superior ReceipU) 

A hare may be rendered far more plump in appea^nce, and 
infinitely easier to carve, by taking out the bones of the back 
and thighs, or of the former only : in removing this, a very 
filiarp knife should be used, and much care will be required to 
avoid catting through the skin just over the spine, as it adheres

doeely to the bone. Nearly double the usual quantity of 
forcemeat must be prepared : with this restore the legs to 
their original shape, and fill the body, which should previously 
be lined with dehcate slices of the nicest bacon, of which the 
rind and edges have been trimmed away. Sew up the hare, 
truss it as usual ; lard it or not, as is most convenient, keep it 
basted plentiftdly vnth butter while roasting, and serve it with 
the customary sauce. We have found two tablespoonsful of the 
finest currant jelly, melted in a half-pint of rich brown gravy, 
an acceptable accompaniment to hare, when the taste has been 
in favour of a sweet sauce. 

To remove the back-bone, dear from it first the flesh m the 
inside ; lay this back to the right and left from the centre of 
the bone to the tips ; then work the knLTe on the upper side 
ouite to the spine, and when the whole is detached except the 
skin which adheres to this, separate the bone at the first joint 
from the neck-bone or ribs ; (we know not how more correctly 
to describe it), and pass the knife with caution under the skin 
down the middle of the back. The directions for bonins the 
thighs of a fowl will answer equally for a hare, and we there- 
fore refer the reader to theuL

Wash and soak the hare thoroughly, wipe it very dry, cat it 
down into joints, dividing the largest, flour and brown it 
slightly in butter, with some bits of kan ham, pour to them by

gently from an hour and a half to two hours : when it is about

plain receipt for stewmg a hare ; but the dish may be enriched 
with forcemeat (No.'l, page 143), rolled into small balls, and 
sinunered for ten minutes in the stew, or fried and added to it 
after it is dished ; a hisher seasoning of spice, a couple of glf^es

TO BOIL BABBITS. 

Rabbits that are three parts 
grown, or, at all events, which 
are etill quite young, should be 
chosen for this mode of cooking. 
Wash and soak them well, truss 
them firmly, with the heads 
turned and skewered to the 
RtbWttruMed for boiling. ^^q^ drop them into plenty of 

boiliiig water, and simmer them gently from thirty to forty-five 
nunutes : when very young thev will require even less time 
than this. Cover them with rich white sauce, mixed vnith the 
livers parboiled, and finely pounded, and welL seasoned with 
cayenne and lemon-juice ; or with white onion sauce, or with 
P^ey and butter, made with milk or cream, instead of water,

the claws clipped dqse, and the legs held in boiling water for a 
minute, that they may be skinned the more ^sily. 

BOILED PARTBIDGES. 

This is a delicate mode of dressing young and tender birds. 
Strip ofl* the feathers, clean, and wash them well ; cut off the 
hea^ truss them like boiled fowls, and when ready, drop them 
into a large pan of boiling water ; throw a little salt on thcni, 
and in fifteen, or at the utmost in eighteen minutes they will be 
ready to serve. Lift them out, dish them quickly, and send 
them to table with white mushroom-sauce, with bread sauce 
and game-gravy (see preceding receipt), or with celerv sauce. 
Our own mode of having them served, is usually with a slice 
of fresh butter, about a tablespoonful of lemon- juice, and a good 
sprinkling of cayenne placed m a very hot dish, under them. 

15 to 18 minutes. 

PARTRIDGES WITH MVSBROOMS. 

For a brace of young well-kept birds, prepare from half to 
three quarters of a pint of mushroom-buttons, or very small 
flaps, as for pickling. Dissolve over a gentle fire an ounce and 
a half of butter, throw in the mushrooms with a slight sprink* 
ling of salt and cayenne, simmer them from eight to ten nunutefl^ 
and turn them, with the butter, 9n to a plate ; when they are 
quite cold, put the whole into the bodies of the partridges, sew 
tnem up, truss them securely, and roast them on a vortical jack 
with the heads downwards; or should an ordinary spit be used, 
tie them firmly to it, instead of passing it through thenL Boast 
them the usual time, and serve them with brown mushroom- 
sauce, or With gravy and bread sauce only. The birds may be

TO BOAST BliACK COCK AUB GRAY HEK. 

These birds, so delicious when well kept and well rossted, 
are tou^h and comparatively flavourless wnen too soon dressed. 
They should hane therefore till they give unequivocal indica- 
tion of being rea^ for the spit Pick and draw them with ex- 
ceeding care, as the skin is easily broken ; truss them Vke 
pheasants, lay them at a moderate distance from a dear biidc 
fire, baste tnem identifiilly and oonstantiy 'with batter, and 
serve them on a thick toast which has been laid under them in 
the dripping-pan for the last ten minutes of their roasting, and 
which vrill have imbibed a high degree of savour: some 
cooks squeeze a little lemon-juice over it before it is put into 
the pan. Send rich brown gravy and bread sauce to table 
with the birds. From three quarters of an hour to a ftdl hour 
will roast them. Though kept to the point which we have 
recommended, they will not offend even the most fastidions 
eater aflter they are dressed, as, unless they have been too long 
allowed to hang, the action of the fire will remove all pero^ 
tible traces of their previous state. In the earlier part of toe. 
season, when warm and dose packing have rendered them, in 
their transit from the North, apparently altogether unfit for 
table, the chloride of soda may be used with gr^ advantage to 
restore them to a fitting state for it; though the copious irash- 
ings whidi must then be resorted to may diminJRh something of 
their fine flavour.

TO BOAST OSOUSB. 

Handle the birds very lightly in picking them, draw, and 
wipe the insides with clean diunp cloths, or first wash, and 
then dry thetn well ; though this latter mode would not be 
approved generally by epicures. Truss the birds in the same 
manner as the blad^ cock, and roast them about half an hour at 
a dear and iNisk fire, keeping them basted almost without inter- 
mission. Serve them on a buttered toast which has been laid 
under them in the pan for ten minutes, or with gravy and bread 
sauce only.

This is an el^ant mode of serving the remains of roasted 
game, but when a saperlatiye salmi is desired, the birds must be 
scarcely more than naif roasted for it In either case, carve 
them yery neatly, and strip every particle of skin and fat from 
the legs, wings, and breasts; bruise the bodies well, and put 
them with the skin, and other trimmings into a very dean stew- 
pan. If fiir a simple and inexpensive dmner, merely add to them 
two or three sliced eschalots, a iMiy leaf, a small blade of mace, 
and a few peppercorns ; then pour in a pint, or rather more, of 
good veal gravy, or strong broth, and boil it briskly until re- 
duced nearly half; strain the eravy, pressing the bones well, to 
obtam all me flavour, skim on the fat, add a little cayenne, and 
lemon-juioe, heat the game very gradually, in it, but do not, on 
any aooount, allow it to boil ; plsMce sipftets of fried bread round 
a dish, arrange the birds in good form in the centre, give the 
faoce a Ixnl, and pour it on them. This is but a homefy sort of 
lalmi, though of excellent flavour if well made ; it may require 
perhaps the addition of a little thickening, and two or tnree 
glasses of dry white wine poured to the bodies of the birds, with 
the broth, would bring it nearer to the French salmi in flavoilr. 
As the spongy substance in the inside of moor fowl and black 
pne is apt to be extremely bitter, when they have been long 
&ept, care ^ould be taken to remove such ps^ as would en- 
danger the preparation.

TO SOAST THE PINTAIL, OB SEA PHEASANT. 

This beautiful bird is by no means rare upon our eastern 
coast, but we know not whether it be much seen in the markets 
generally. It is most excellent eating, and should be roasted at 
a dear quick fire, well floured when first laid down, turned 
briskly, and basted with butter almost without cessation. If 
drawn firom the spit in from twenty-five to thirty minutes, then 
dished and laid before the fire for two or three more, it will give 
forth a singularly rich gravy. Score the breast when it is 
carved, sprinkle on it a little cayenne and fine salt,'and let a cut 
lemon be handed round the table when the bird is served ; or 
omit the scoring, and send round with it brown gravy, and 
Christopher North*8 sauce made hot. 

20 to 30 minutes. 

TO BOAST WILD DUCKS. 

These are prepared for the spit exactly like the tame ones, 
^ the exception of the stufiing, which is never used for wild 
M. A bit of soft bread soaked in port wine, or in claret, is 
betimes put into them, but nothing more. Flour them well, 
lay them rather near to a very clear and brisk fire, that they 
^7 be quickly browned, and yet retain their juices. Baste 
them plentifiilhr and constantly with butter, and, if it can be so 
'^golated, let tne erpit turn with them rapidly. From fifteen to 
twenty minutes wiU roast them sufi^dently for the generality of 
waters; but for those who object to them much unaerdressed, a 
few additional minutes must be allowed. Something less of 
thne will suffice when they are prepared for persons who like 
them scarcely more than heated through. 

Teal, which is a more delicate kind of wild fowl, is roasted in 
the same way : in from ten to fifteen minutes it will be enough 
^ for the £ishionable mode of serving it, and twenty minutes 
^ dress it well at a good fire.

CURRIES, POTTED MEATS, &c 




Hot Water Disb, / 

The great superiority of the oriental curries over those generally 
prepared in England is not, we believe, altogether the result of 
a want of skill or of experience on the part of our cooks, but is 
attributable, in some measure, to many of the ingredients, which 
in afresh and green state add so much to Uieir excellence, being 
here beyond our reach. 
The natives of the East compound and vaiy t-hia class of 



j 
CHIP. XIT.3 CURRIES, POTTED MEATS, &C. 287 

dishes, we are told, with infinite ingenuity, blending in them 
very agreeably many condiments of different flavour, until the 
highest d^ree of piquancy and savour is produced, the whole 
being tempered with fine v^etable adds. With us, turmeric 
and cayenne pepper prevail m them often far too powerfully : 
the prodigal use of the former should be especially avoided, as 
it injures both the quality and the colour of the currie, which 
ooght to be of a dark green, rather than of a red or yellow hue. 
The first is given by the genuine powder imported from India ; 
the others, by the greater number of spurious ones, sold in 
England, under its name. A couple of ounces of a^ sweet, sound 
cocoa-nut, lightly grated and stewed for nearly or quite an hour 
in the gravy of a currie, is a great improvement to its flavour : 
it will be found particularly agreeable with that of sweetbreads, 
and may be served in the currie, or strained &om it at pleasure. 
Great care, however, should be taken not to use, for the pur- 
pose, a nut that is rancid. Spinage, cucumbers, vegetable 
marrow, tomatas, acid apples, green gooseberries (seeded), and 
tamarinds imported in the shell — not preserved — ^may all, in 
their season, be added, with very good effect, to curries of 
different kinds. Potatoes and celery are also occasionally boiled 
down in them. 

The rice for a currie should always be sent to table in a 
separate dish from it, and, in serving them, it should be first 
Itelped, and the currie laid upon it.

Let the seeds be of the finest quality. Dry them well,

exceedingly a^eable and aromatic powder, when all the ingre-

is considered so, a '* high-caste" chemist should be applied to

good slice of batter in a deep, well-tinned stewpan or saucepan, 
and shake it over a brisk fire for four or five minutes, or until 
it begins to take colour, then put in the meat, and brown it well 
and equally, without allowing a morsel' to be scorched. The 
pan should be shaken vigorously every minute or two, and the 
meat turned in it frequently. When this is done, lift it out and . 
throw mto the stewpan two or three large onions finely minced, 
and four or five eschalots when these last are liked ; add a 
morsel of butter, if needful, and fry them until they begin to 
soften; then add a quarter pint of gravy, broth, or boiling 
water, and a large acid apple, or two moderate-sized ones, of a 
good boiling kind, with the hearts of two or three lettuces, or 
of one hard cabbage, shred quite small (tomatas or cucumbers 
freed from their seeds can be substituted for these, when in 
season). Stew the whole slowly until it resembles a thick

should it become too dry; put in the meat, and simmer the 
whole very softly imtil this is done, which will be in from three

290 MODERN COOKERY* [CHAF. XIT. 



A COMMON JSDIABf CtJBElB. 

For each pound of meat, whether yeal, mutton, or bee( take 
a heaped tablespoonful of good currie powder, a small teaspoon- 
ful or salt, and one of flour; mix these well together, and after 
having cut down the meat into thick small cuUets, or squares, 
rub half of the mixed powder equally over it. Next, fry gently 
from one to four or five large onions sliced, with or widaont the 
addition of a small dove of garlic, or half a dozen eschalots^ 
juxx)rdin^ to the taste; and when they are of a fine golden 
T)rown, hfb them out with a slice and lay them upon a sieve to 
drain; throw a little more butter into the pan and fry the 
meat lightly in it ; drain it well from the fat m taking it oat, 
and lay it into a clean stewpan or saucepan ; strew &e onion 
over it, and pour in as much boiling water as will almost cover 
it. Mix the remainder of the currie-powder smoothly with a 
little broth or cold water, and aftdr the currie has stewed for a 
few minutes pour it in, shaking the pan well round that it may 
be smoothly blended with the gravy. ^Simmer the whole very 
sofrly until the meat is perfectly tender : this will be in from 
an hour and a quarter, to two hours and a half, according to 
the quantity and the nature of the lAeat. Mutton will be the 
soonest done ; the brisket end (gristles) of a breast of veal will 
require twice as much stewing, and sometimes more. A fowl 
will be ready to serve in an hour. An add apple or two, or 
any of the vegetables which we have enumerated at the com- 
mencement of this Chapter, may be added to the currie, proper 
time being allowed for cooking each variety. Very young 
green peas are liked by some people in it; and cucumbers pared, 
seeded, and cut moderately small, are always a good adoition. 
A richer currie will of course be produced if gravy or broth be 
substituted for the water : either, should be boiling when poured 
to the meat. Lemon-juice should be stirred in before it is 
served, when there is no other acid in the currie. A dish of 
boiled rice must be sent to table with it. A couple of pounds 
of meat free from bone, is sufficient quite for a moderate-sized 
dish of this kind, but three of the breast of veal are sometimes 
used for it, when it is to be served to a large family-party of 
currie-eaters : from half to a whole pound of rice should then 
accompany it. For the proper mode of boiling it, see mull»" 
gitawny soup. Chapter I. The small grained, or Patna, is the 
kind which ought to be used for the purpose. Six ounces is 
quite sufficient ror a not large currie ; and a pound, when boiled

SBLIM^S CUBBIES. 

{Captain Whitens,) 

These curries are made with a sort of paste, which is labelled 
with the above names, and as it has attracted some attention of 
bte, and the curries made with it are very good, and quickly 
and easily prepared, we give the directions for them. " Cut a 
poond and a half of chicken, fowl, veal, rabbit, or mutton, into 
pieces an inch and a h<df square. Put from two to three 
ounces of fresh butter in a stewpan, and when it is melted put 
in the meat, and give it a good stir with a wooden spoon ; add 
from two to three dessertspoonsful of the currie-paste ; mix the 
whole up well together, and continue the stirring over a brisk 
fire from five to ten minutes, and the currie will be done. 
This is a dry currie. For a gravy currie, add two or three table- 
spoonsful of boiling water aner the paste is well mixed in, and 
continue the stewing and stirring from ten to twelve minutes 
longer, keeping the sauce of the consistency of cream. Prepare 
salmon and lobster in the same way, but very quickly, that they 
may come up firm. The paste may be nibbed over steaks, or 
cutlets, when they are nearly broiled; three or four minutes will 
finish them." ♦

water slightly salted, with a very small bit of butter dissolyed 
in it; dnun it perfectly, and then put it into a full pint and a 
quarter of good beef or veal stock or gravy, previously mixed, 
and boiled fur twenty minutes, with a small tablespoonfol of 
fine currie-powder, a teaspoonM of a^w-root, and a little 
lemon-juice. Heat and toss the maccaroni gently in this until 
it is well and equally covered with it. A small quantity of 
rich cream, or a little bechamel, will very much improve the 
sauce, into which it should be stiired just before the maccaroni 
is added, and the lemon-juice should be thrown in afterwards. 
This dish is, to our taste, far better without the strong flavour- 
ing of onion or garlic, usually given to curries; which can, 
however, be imparted to the gravy in t}ie usual way, when 
it is liked. 

Ribband maccaroni, 6 ozs. : 15 minutes. Gravy, or good 
beef or veal stock, full pint and i; fine currie-powder, 1 small 
tablespoonful; arrow-root, 1 teaspooid^; little lemon-juice: 
20 minutes. Maccaroni in sauce, 3 to 6 minutes. 

Obs, — An ounce or two of grated cocoa-nut, simmered in the 
gravy for half an hour or more, then strained and well pressed 
&om it, is always an excellent addition. The pipe maccaroni, 
well curried, is extremely good : the .sauce for both kinds should 
be made wdth rich gravy, especially when the onion is omitted. 
A few drops of eschalot- vinegar can be added to it when the 
flavour is liked. 

CUBRIEB EGGS. 

Boil six or eight fresh eggs quite hard, as for salad, and put 
them aside until they are cold. Mix well together from two to 
three ounces of good butter, and from three to four dessert- 
spoonsful of cume-powder ; shake them in a stewpan or thick 
saucepan, over a clear but moderate fire for some minutes, then 
throw in a couple of mild onions finely minced, and fry them 
gently until they are tolerably soft ; pour to them, by degrees, 
from half to three quarters of a pint of broth or gravy, and 
stew them slowlv until they are reduced to pulp; mix smoothly 
a small cup of thick cream with two teaspoonsi'ul of wheaten of 
of rice-flour, stir them to the currie, and simmer the whole until 
the raw taste of the thickening is gone. Cut the eggs into half 
inch slices, heat them quite through in the sauce without boiling 
them, and serve them as hot as possible. 

CUBBIED SWEETBBEADS. 

Wash and soak them as usual, then throw them into boiling 



CHAP. XIT.] CURRIES, POTTED MEATS, &C. 2.93 

VBter with a little salt in it, and a whole onion, and let them 
simmer for ten minutes ; or, if at hand, substitute weak veal 
broth for the water. Lift them out, place them on a drainer, 
and leave them until they are perfectly cold ; then cut them 
into i2Alf>inch slices, and either flour and fry them lightly in 
butter, or put them, without this, into as much curried gravy 
as will just cover them ; stew them in it very gently, from 
twenty to thirty minutes ; add as much lemon-juice or Chili 
vinegar as will acidulate the sauce agreeably,* and serve the 
currie very hot. As we have already stated in two or three 
previous receipts, an ounce or more of sweet freshly-grated 
cocoa nut, stewed tender in the gravy, and strained from it, 
before the sweetbreads are added, will give a peculiarly pleasant 
flavour to all curries. 

Blanched 10 minutes ; sliced (fried or not) ; stewed 20 to 30 
minutes. 

CUBRIED OYSTEBS. 

" Let a hundred of large sea-oysters be opened into a basin, 
without losing one drop of their liquor. Put a lump of fresh 
butter into a good-sized saucepan, and when it boils, add a large 
onion, cut into thin slices, and let it fry in the uncovered stew- 
pan until it is of a rich brown ; now add a bit more butter, and 
two or three tablespoonsfiil of currie-powder. When these in- 
gredients are well mixed over the fire with a wooden spoon, add 
gradually either hot water, or broth from the stock-pot ; c6ver , 
the stewpan, and let the whole boil up. Meanwhile, have 
ready the meat of a cocoa-nut, grated or rasped fine, put this 
into the stewpan with a few sour tamarinds (if they are to be 
obtained, if not, a sour apple, chopped). Let the whole simmer 
over the fire until the apple is dissolved, and the cocoa-nut 
very tender ; then add a cupful of strong thickening made of 
flour and water, and sufficient salt, as a currie will not bear 
being salted at table. Let this boil up for five minutes. Have 
ready also, a vegetable marrow, or part of one, cut. into bits, and 
sufficiently boiled to require little or no further cooking. Put 
this in with a tomiata or two ; either of these vegetables may be 
omitted. Now put into the stewpan the ovsters with their 
liquor, and the milk of the cocoa-nut ; stir them well with the 
former ingredients ; let the currie stew gently for a few minutes, 
then throw in the strained juice of naif a lemon. Stir the 
currie from time to time with a wooden spoon, and as soon as

the oysters are done enough serve it up with a corresponding 
dish of rice on the opposite side of the table. The dish is con- 
sidered at Madras the ne plus ultra of Indian eocikxxfr* 

We have extracted this receipt, as it stands, firom the Maga- 
zine of Domestic Economy, the season in which we have met 
with it not permitting us to have it tested. Such of our read- 
ers as may have partaken of the true Oriental preparation, mil 
be able to judge of its correctness ; and others may consider it 
worthy of a trml. We should suppose it necessary to beard the 
oysters. 

CUBBIED GBAVT. 

The quantity of onion, eschalot, or garlic used for a cnriie 
should be regulated by the taste of the persons for whom it is 
prepared ; the veiy large proportions of them which are accept- 
able to some eaters, preventing others altogether from partaking 
of the dish. Slice, and fry gently in a little good butter, from 
a couple to six large onions (with a bit of garlic, and four or 
five eschalots, or none of either), when tney are coloured 
equally of a fine yellow-brown, lift them on to a sieve reversed 
to dram ; put them into a clean saucepan, add a pint and a half 
of good ^vy, with a couple of ounces of rasped cocoa-nut, or 
of any other of the condiments we have already specified, which 
may require as much stewing as the onions (an apple or two, 
for instance), and sinuner them softly from half to uiree quar- 
ters of an hour, or until the onion is sufiiciently tender to be 
pressed through a strainer. We would reconmiend that for a 
delicate currie this should always be done ; for a conunon one 
it is not necessary ; and many persons prefer to have the whole 
of it left in this last. After the gravy has been worked through 
the strainer, and again boils, a& to it from three to four d^- 
sertspoonsful of currie-powder, and one of flour, with as much 
salt as the gravy may require, the whole mixed to a smooth 
batter with a small cupfiu of good cream.* Simmer it from 
fifteen to twenty minutes, and it will be ready for use. Lob- 
ster, prawns, shrimps, maccaroni, hard-boiled eggs, cold calf [s 
head, and various other meats may be heat^ and served in it 
with advantage. For all of these, and indeed for ev&rj kind of 
currie, acid of some sort should be added. Chili vinegar an- 
swers well when no fresh lemon-juice is at hand. 

* Native oytten, prepared as for aauce, may be carried by the leeeipt for egp 
or Hwetrtbreads, with the addition of their liquor. 

f This muit be added only Jiut before the cnrrie is dished, when any aeidft^^^ 
has been boiled in the grav/ 1 it may then be first blended with a nnall portion 
of arrow-root, or flour.

Obs,—m India, curds are frequently added to curries, but 
that may possibly be from their abounding much more than 
sweet cream in so hot a climate. 



POTTED MEATS. 

Any tender and well- roasted meat, taken free of fat, skin, and 
gristle, as well as from the dry outsides, will answer for potting 
admirably, better, indeed^ than that which is generally baked 
for the purpose, and which is usually quite deprived of its 
juices by the process. Spiced or corned beef also is excellent 
when thus prepared ; and any of these will remain good a long 
time if mixed with cold fresh butter, instead of that which is 
clarified; but no addition that can be made to it will render the 
meat eatable, unless it be thoroughly pounded; reduced, in fact, 
to the smoothest possible paste, £ree from a single Imnp or a 
morsel of unbroken fibre. If rent into fragments,' instead of 
being cut quite through the grain, in being minced, before it is 
put into the mortar, no beating will bring it to the proper 
state. Unless it be very dry, it is better to pound it for some 
time bdbre any butter is added, and it must be long and 
patiently beaten after all the ingredients are mixed, that 
the whole may be equally blended and well mellowed in 
flayour. 

The quantity of butter required will depend upon the nature 
of the meat; ham and salted beef will need a larger proportion 
than roast meat, or than the breasts of poultry and game ; white 
fish, from being less dry, will requure comparativelv little. 
Salmon, lobsters, prawns, and shrimps are all extremely good, 
prepared in this way. They should, however, be perfectly 
u'e^when they are poundeo, and be set inmiediately after- 
wards into a very cool place. For these, and for white meats 
in general, mace, nutmeg, and cayenne or white pepper, are the 
appropriate spices. A small quantity of cloves may be added 
to nare and other brown meat, but allspice we would not re- 
commend unless the taste is kno¥m to be in favour of it. The 
following receipt for pounding ham will serve as a general one 
for the particular manner of proceeding. 



296 UODERN COOKERY. [c&AP. XIV. 



POTTED HAM. 

(-^n excellent Receipt^ 

To be eaten in perfection this should be made with a fireshly 
cured ham, which, a^r having been soaked for twelve hours, 
should be wiped diy, nicely trimmed, closely wrapped in coarse 
paste, and baked very tender.* When it comes from the oven, 
remove the crust and rind, and when the ham is perfectly cold, 
take for each pound of the lean, which should be weighed after 
every morsel of skin and fibre has been carefully removed, six 
ounces of cold roast veal, prepared with equal nicety. Mince 
these quite fine with an exceedingly sharp knife, taking care to 
cut through the meat, and not to tear the fibre, as on this much 
of the excellence of the preparation depends. Next put it into a 
large stone or marble mortar, and pound it to the smoothest 
paste with eight ounces of fresh butter, which must be added 
by degrees. When three parts beaten, strew over it a tea- 
spoonful of freshly-pounded mace, half a large, or the whole of 
a small nutmeg grated, and the third of a teaspoonful of ca- 
yeime well mixed together. It is better to limit the spice to 
this quantity in the first instance, and to increase afterwards 
either of the three kinds to the taste of the parties to whom 
the meat is to be served.f W"e do not find half a teaspoonful 
of cayenne, and nearly two teaspoonsful of mace, more than is 
generally approved. After the spice is added, keep the meat 
often turned from the sides to the middle of the mortar, that 
it may be seasoned equally in every part. When perfectly 
pounded, press it into small potting-pans, and pour clarifiw 
butter J over the top. If kept in a cool and dry place, this 
meat will remain good for a fortnight, or more. 

Lean of ham, 1 lb. ;. lean of roast veal, 6 ozs. ; fresh butter, 
8 ozs. ; mace, from 1 to 2 teaspoonsful ; | large nutmeg ; ca- 
yenne, i to i teaspoonful. 

Ohs. — The roast veal is ordered in this receipt because the 
ham alone is generally too salt ; for the same reason butter, 
fresh taken from the chum, or that which is but slightly 
salted and quite new, should be iised for it in preference to its 
own fat. When there is no ready-dressed veal in the house, 
the best part of the neck, roasted or stewed, will supply the

is always necessary in using it.

rqaisite quantity. The remains of a cold boiled ham will 
answer quite well for pottihg, even when a little dry. 

POTTED CHICKEN, PABTSIPOE, OB PHEASANT. 

Roast the birds as for table, but let them be thoroughly 
done, for if the gmyy be left in, the meat will not keep hslf so 
well. Kaise the flesh of the breast, wings, and merrythought 
quite dear from the bones, take off the skin, mince, and then 
pound it very smoothly with about one third of its weight of 
&esh butter^ or something less, if the meat should appear of a 
proper consistence without the full quantity; season it with 
salt, mace, and cayenne only, and add these in small portions 
until the meat is rather highly flavoured with both the last : 
proceed with it as with other potted meats. 

POTTED OX-TONGUE. 

Boil tender an unsmoked tongue of good flavour, and the 
following day cut from it the quantity desired for potting, or 
take for this purpose the remains of one which has already 
been served at table. Trim off the skin and rind, weigh the 
meat, mince it very small, then pound it as fine as possible with 
four ounces of butter to each pound of tongue, a small tea- 
spoonful of mace, half as much of nutmeg and cloves, and a 
tolerably high seasoning of cavenne. After the spices are well 
beaten with the meat, taste it, aud add more if required. A 
few ounces of any weH-roasted meat mixed with the tongue 
will give it firmness, in which it is apt to be deficient. The 
breasts of turkeys, fowls, partridges, or pheasants may be used 
for the purpose with good effect. 

Tongue, 1 lb. ; butter, 4 ozs. ; mace, 1 teaspoonful ; nutmeg 
and cloves each, j teaspoonful ; cayenne, £1 to 10 grains. 

POTTED ANCHOVIES. 

Scrape the anchovies very clean, raise the flesh from the 
bones, and pound it to a periect paste in a Wedgwood or marble 
mortar ; then with the back of a wooden spoon press it through 
a hair-sieve reversed. Kext, weigh the anchovies, and pound 
them again with double their weight of the freshest butter that 
can be procured, a high seasoning of mace and cayenne, and a 
small quantity of finely-grated nutmeg ; set the mixture by in 
a cool place tor three or four hours to narden it before it is put 
into the potting pans. If butter be poured over, it must be 
only lukewarm ; but the anchovies will keep well for two or 
three weeks without. A little rose-pink may be added to

improTe the colour, but it must be used sparingly, or it will 
impart a bitter taste. The quantity of butter can be increased 
or diminished in proportion as it is wished that the llayour of 
the anchoyies should prevsdl. 

Anchovies pounded, 3 ozs. ; butter, 6 ozs. ; mace, third of 
teaspoonful ; naif as much cayenne ; little nutmeg. 

IX>BST£B BUTTEB. 

Pound to the smoothest paste the coral of one or two fine 
lobsters, mix with it about a third of its volume of fresh butter, 
and the same proportion of spices as are given in the preceding 
receipt. Let tne whole be thoroughly blended ; set it by for a 
while in a cool place and pot it, or make it up into small pats 
and serve them with curled parsley round the dish, or with any 
licht foliage that will contrast well with their brilliant colour. 
Tne flesh of the lobster may be cut fine with a very sharp 
knife, and pounded with the coral.

Let the fish be quite freshly boiled, shell them quicklv, «pd 
just before they are put into the mortar, chop them a litUewith 
a veiy sharp knife ; pound them perfectly witii a small quantity 
of fresh butter, mace, and cayenne.

CHAPTER XV. 




ArtlcbokM 4 la Reioe. 



YEOETABUE8. 

Tbb quality of vegetables depends mndi botli on the soil in 
which they are grown, and on the degree of care bestowed upon 
their culture; but if produced in ever so great perfection, 
their excellence will be entirely destroyed if they be badly 
cooked. 

With the exception of artichokes, which are said to be im- 
proved by two or three days* keeping, all the summer varieties 
should be dressed before their first Seshness has in any degree 
passed off (for their flavour is never so fine as withm a few 
hours of their being cut or gathered ) ; but when this cannot be 
done, precaution should be taken to prevent their withering. 
The stalk-ends of ai^paragus, cucumbers, and vegetable-marrow 
should be placed in from one to two inches of cold water ; and 
all other kinds should be spread on a cool brick floor. When 
this has been neglected, they must be thrown into cold water for 
some time before they are boiled to recover them, though they 
will prove even then but very inferior eating. 

Vegetables when not sufliciently cooked are known to be so 
exceedingly unwholesome and indigestible, that the custom of 
serving mem crisp^ whidi means, in reality, only half-b^ed, 
should be altogether disregarded when health is considered ^ 
more importai^ than fasluon ; but tiiey should not be ~^®J^^ 
to remain in the water after they are quite done, o^^^^r ^^^ 
nutritive properties and their flavour vrill be lost, and their good 
appearance destroyed. Care should be taken to drmn them 
ihoroughly in a wwrm strainer, and to serve them very not, witn 
well-made sauces, if with any. -t . 

Only dried peas or beans, Jerusalem artichokes, af °;PJJ^ 
toes, ire put at first into cold water. ^All o*^^^,^^ 
plenty of fast-boiling water, which should be ready sawea ana 
skinun^ before they are thrown into it. 



300 MODERN COOKERY, [cHAP. XV. 



TO CLBAB VEGETABLES FBOM INSECTS. 

Lay them for half an hour or more into a pan of strong 
brine, with the stalk ends uppermost ; this will destroy the 
small snails and other insects which cluster in the leaves, and 
they will fall out and sink to the bottom. A pound and a half 
of salt to the gallon of water will answer for this purpose, and 
if strained daily it will last for some time. 

TO BOIL VEGETABLES GREEN. 

Aiter they have been properly prepared and v^ashed, throw 
them into plenty of boiling water which has been salted and 
well skimmed ; and keep them uncovered and boiling fast until 
they are done, taking every precaution against their being 
smoked. Should the water be very hard, a bit of soda the size 
of a hazel-nut, or a small half-teaspoonful of carbonate of 
soda, may be added with the salt, for every two quarts, and will 
greatly improve the colour of the vegetables ; but if used in 
undue proportion it will injure them; green peas espedally 
will be quickly reduced to a mash if boiled with too large a 
quantity. 

Water, 1 gallon ; salt, 2 ozs.; soda, i to ^ oz. ; or carbonate 
of soda, 1 teaspoonful.

' Potatoes, to boil well together, should be all of the same 
sort, and as nearly equal in size as may be. Wash off the 
mould, and scrub them very clean with a hard brush, but 
neither scoop nor apply a knife to them in any way, even to 
clear the eyes.* Rinse them well, and arrange them compactly 
in a saucepan, so that they may not lie loose in the water, and 
that a smair quantity may suffice to cover them. Pour this in 
cold, and when it boils, throw in about a large teaspoonful of 
salt to the quart, and sinuner the potatoes until they are nearly 
done, but for the last two or three minutes let th§m boil 
rapidly. When they are tender quite through, which mav be 
known by probing them with a fork, pour m the water from

the water quite away, and let them steam hy the side of the 
fire from four to nve minutes longer. Dish them carefully, 
pour white sauce over them, and serve them with the second 
course. Old potatoes thus prepared, have often been made to 
pass for new ones, at the Jsest tables, at the season in which the 
fresh vegetable is dearest. The time required to boil them will 
of course vary with their quality : we give the method which 
we have found very successful. 

FRIED POTATOES. (eNTBEHETS.) 

After having washed them, wipe and pare some raw potatoes, 
cut them in slices of equal thickness, or into thin shavmgs, and 
throw them into plenty of boiling butter, or very pure clarified 
dripping. Fry them of a fine light brown, and very crisp ; lift 
them oilt with a skimmer, drain them on a soft warm cloth, 
dish them very hot, and sprinkle fine salt over them. This is 
an admirable way of dressing potatoes, very common on the 
Continent, but less so in England than it deserves to be. When 
pared round and round to a corkscrew form, in ribbons or 
shavings of equal width, and served dry and well fried^ lightly 
piled in a dish, they make a handsome appearance and are 
excellent eating. We have known them served in this country 
with a slight sprinkling of cayenne. K sliced they should be 
something less than a quarter-inch thick. 

MASHED POTATOES. * 

Boil them perfectly tender quite through, pour off the water, 
and steam them very dry by the directions already given in 
the receipt of page 300 ; peel them quickly, take out every 
speck, and while tney are still hot press the potatoes through 
an earthen cullender, or bruise them to a smooth mash with a 
strong wooden fork or spoon, but never pound them m a ^^' 
tar, as that will reduce them to a close heavy paste. Let them 
he entirely free from lumpsy for nothing can be more mdicative 
of carelessness or want of skill on the part of the cooK, tnan 
mashed potatoes sent to table full of these. ^^^VTJf ^^

with the finest bread-cmmbs, and shaken free of the loose ones, 
then turned out, and browned in a Dutch or common oyen. 
More or less liquid will be required to moisten sufficiently 
potatoes of various kinds. 

Potatoes mashed, 2 lbs. ; salt, 1 te^poonful ; butter, 1 to 2 
ozs. ; milk or cream, i pint. 

Obs, — Mashed potatoes are often moulded with a cnp, and 
then equally browned ; any other shape will answer the purpose 
as well, and many are of better appearance. 

ENGZJSH POTATO BAULS. 

Boil some floury potatoes very dir, mash them as smoothly 
as possible, season them well witn salt and white pepper ; warm 
them with about an ounce of butter to the pound, or rather 
more if it will not render them too moist; a few spoonsful of 
good cream may be added, but they must be boiled very dry 
after it is stirred to them. Let the mixture cool a little, roll it 
into balls, sprinkle over them vermicelli crushed slightly with 
the hand, and fry them a fine light brown. They may he 
dished round a shape of plain mashed potatoes, or piled on a 
napkin by themselves. They may likewise be rolled in egg 
and fine bread-crumbs insteaa of in the vermicelli, or in rice 
flour, which answers very well for them. 

POTATO BOULETTES. (eNTKEMETS.) 

(Good.) 

Boil some good potatoes as di^ as possible, or let them be 
prepared by Captain Kater's receipt ; mash a pound of them 
very smoothly, and mix with them while they are still warm, 
two ounces of fresh butter, a teaspoonftil of salt, a little nut- 
meg, the beaten and strained yolks of four eg^ and last of all 
the whites thoroughly whisked. Mould with, and drop the 
mixture from a teaspoon, into a small pan of boiling butter, or 
of very pure lard, and fry the boulettes for five minutes over a 
moderate fire : they should be* of a fine pale brown, and very 
light. Drain them well and dish them on a hot napkin. 

Potatoes, 1 lb.; butter, 2 ozs.; salt, 1 teaspoonful; eggs, 4: 
6 minutes, 

POTATO BISSOUBS. 

(Frefich,) 

Mash and season the potatoes with salt, and white pepper or 

cayenne, and dmx with them plenty of minced parsley, and a 

^U quantity of green onions, or eschalots; add sufficient 



CHAP. XV.] YEGBTABLES. 305 

jolks of egg to bind the mixture together, roll it into small 
balls, and fry them in plenty of lautl or butter over a moderate 
fire, or they will be too much browned before they are done 
through. Ham, or any other kind of meat finely minced, may 
be substituted for the nerbs, or added to them. 

POTATOES X LA BfATTBE i>*HOTEL. 

Boil in the usual manner some potatoes of a firm kind, peel, 
and let them cool ; then cut them equally into quarteroinch slices. 
Dissolve in a very clean stewpan or saucepan from two to 
four ounces of good butter, stir to it a small dessertspoonful of 
flour, and shake the pan over the fire for two or three minutes; 
add by slow d^rees a small cup of boilinff water, some 
pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful of minced parsley ; put in the 
potatoes, and toss them gently over a clear fire untU they are 
quite hot, and the sauce adheres well to them ; at the instant of 
serving add a dessertspoonful of strained lemon-juice. Pale 
veal gravy may be sul^tituted for the water ; and the potatoes 
after being thickly sliced, may be quickly cut of the same size 
with a smiall round cutter. 

POTATOES X LA CBEME. 

Prepare the potatoes as above, and toss them gently in a 
quarter-pint or more of thick white sauce or of common 
bediamel, with or without the addition of the minced parsley. 

TO BOIL SEA-KALE. 

Wash, trim, and tie the kale in bunches, and throw it into 
plenty of boiling water with some salt in it. When it is per- 
lectly tender, lift it out, drain it well from the water, and send 
it to table with good melted butter. When fashion is not par- 
ticularly regarded we would recommend its being served upon a 
toast like asparagus. About twenty minutes wiu boil it, rather 
less for persons who like it crisp. 

18 to 20 minutes. 

SEA-KALE STEWED IN GRAVY. (eNTBEMETS.) 

Boil the kale for ten minutes in salt and water ; drain it well, 
and put it into a saucepan with as much good brown gravy as 
^ill nearly cover it ; stew it gently for ten minutes or until it is 
tender, and send it to table in the gravy very hot. Another 
excellent mode of serving this vegetable is, to boil it in salt and 
water, and to pour over it plenty of rich white sauce alter it is 
dished.

SPINACH. (eNTBEMETS.) 

(^French Receipt) 

Pick the (Spinach leaf by leaf from the stems, and wash it in 
abundance of spring water, changing it several times; then 
shake it in a dry cloth held by the four comers, or drain it on a 
large sieve. Tftirow it into sufficient well-salted boiling water 
to allow it to float freely, and keep it pressed down with a 
skimmer that it may be equally done. When quite young it 
will be tender in from eight to ten minutes, but to ascertain if 
it be so, take a leaf and squeeze it between the fingers. If to 
be dressed in the French mode, drain, and then throw it directly 
into plenty of fresh water, and when it is cool form it into balls 
and press the moisture thoroughly from it with the hands. 
Kext, chop it extremely fine upon a clean trencher ; put two 
ounces (for a large dish) of butter into a stewpan or bright 
thick saucepan, lay the spinach on it, and keep it stirred over a 
gentle fire for ten minutes, or until it appears dry ; dredge in a 
spoonfrd of flour, and turn the spinach as it is added ; pour to 
it gradually, a few spoonsM of very rich veal gravy, or, if 
preferred, of good boiling cream, (with the last of these a 
dessertspoonful or more of pounded sugar may be added for a 
second-course dish, when the true Frencn mode of dressing the 
vegetable is liked.) Stew the whole briskly until the whole is 
well absorbed; dish, and serve the spinach veir hot, with small, 
pale fried sippets round it, or vdth leaves of puff paste fi:e8h 
from the oven, or well dried after having been fried. For 
ornament, the sippets may be fancifully shaped with a tin cutter. 
A proper seasonmg of salt must not be omitted in this or any 
other preparation of the spinach. 

SPINACH, 1 Ii*ANGLAISE. (eNTREMETS.) 

(Or, English fashion.) 

Boil the spinach as already directed, and after it has beoi 
well squeezed and chopped, stir it over a moderate fire until it 
is very dry ; moisten it with as much thick rich gravy as will 
flavour it well, and turn and stew it quite fast until it is again 
very dry ; then press it into a hot mould of handsome form, 
turn it into a dish and serve it quickly. Two or three ounces 
of fresh butter may be laid into the sauc^n with the spinach 
at first, as a substitute for the gravy. Wnen a perforated tin 
shape, ordinarily used for moulding ^inach, is not at hand, one 
of earthenware, slightly buttered, will serve nearly as welL

SPINACH. 

(Common English mode*) 

BoH the spinach very green in plenty of water, drain, and 
then press the moisture from it between two trenchers ; chop it 
small, pat it into a clean saucepan, >vith a slice of fresh butter, 
and stir the whole until well mixed and very hot. Smooth it in 
a dish, mark it in dice, and send it quickly to table. 

ANOTHEB COMMON ENGLISH RECEIPT FOR SPINACH. 

Take it leaf by leaf from the stalks, and be very careful to 
clear it &om any weeds that may be amongst it, and to free it 
by copious and repeated washings tram every particle of grit, 
hit it into a large well-tinned stewpan or saucepan, with the 
water only which hangs about it ; throw in a small spoonfril 
of salt, and keep it constantly pressed down with a wooden 
spoon, and turned often for about a quarter of an hour, or until 
it is perfectly tender. Drain off the superfluous moisture, chop 
the spinach quickly on a hot trencher ; dish and serve it imme- 
diately. Fried sippets of bread should always be served round 
this vegetable, unless it be prepared for an invalid. 

BOILEB TURNIP-RADISQfiS. 

These should be freshly drawn, young and white. Wash 
and trim them neatly, leaving on two or three of the small 
inner leaves of the top. Boil them in plenty of salted water 
&om twenty to thirty minutes, and as soon as they are tender send 
them to table well drained, with melted butter or white sauce. 
Common radishes when young, tied in bimches, and boiled from 
eighteen to twenty-five minutes, then served on a toast like 
asparagus, are very good. 

BOILED LEEKS. 

Trim off the coarser leaves from some young leeks, cut them 
into equal lengths, tie them into small bunches, and boU them 
in plenty of water which has been previously salted and 
skimmed; serve them on a toast, and send melted butter to 
table with them. 

20 to 25 minutes. 

STEWED LETTUCES. 

Strip off the outer leaves, and cut away the stalks ; wash the 
lettuces with exceeding nicety, and throw them into water salted 
as for all green vegetables. When they are quite tender, which 



S08 MODERN COOECRY. QCHAF. XT. 

will be in from twenty to thirty minutes, according to their 
a^e, lift them out, and press the water thoroughly from them ; 
cnop them a little, and heat them in a clean saucepan with a 
seasoning of pepper and salt, and a small slice of butter; then 
dredge in a little flour and stir them well ; add next a small cup 
of broth or gravy, boil them quickly until they are tolerably 
dry, then stir in a little pale vinegar or lemon-juice, and serve 
them as hot as possible, with fHed sippets round them. 

TO BOIL ASPABAGUS. 

With a sharp knife scrape the stems of the asparagus lightly, 
but very clean, from within one to two inches of the greoi 
tender points, throw them into cold waiter as they are done, and 
when all are ready, tie them in bimches of equal size; cat the 
large ends evenly, that the asparagus may be all of the same 
length, and put it into plenty of boiling water prepared by the 
directions of page 310. Cut a round of bread quite half an inch 
thick, and auer having pai*ed off the crust, toast it a delicate 
brown on both sides. When the stalks of the asparagus are 
tender, lift it out directly, or it will lose both its colour and its 
flavour, and will also be liable to break ; dip the toast quickly 
into the water in which it was boiled, and dish the v^etable 
upon it, with the ]k)ints meeting in the centre. Send rich 
melted butter to table with it. In France, a small quantity of 
vinegar is stirred into the sauce before it is served ; and many 
persons like the addition. Asparagus may be preserved for a 
day or two sufficiently fresh for use, by keeping the stalks 
immersed in an inch depth of cold water ; but it is never so 
good as when dressed directly it is cut, or within a few hours 
after. 

20 to 25 minutes. 

Obs, — Abroad, boiled asparagus is very frequently served 
cold, and eaten with oil and vinegar, or a sauce Mayonnaise. 

ASPARAGUS POINTS DRESSER LIKE PEAS. (eNTRBMRTS.) 

This is a convenient mode of dressing asparagus, when it is 
too small and green to make a good appearance plainly bofled. 
Cut the points so far only as they are perfectly tender, m bits of 
equal size, not more than the tnird of an inch in length; V8sh 
them very clean, and throw them into plenty of boiling water, 
with the usual quantity of salt and a moi-sel of soda. When 
they are tolerably tender, which will be in from ten to twelve 
minutes, drain them well, and spread them on a clean ck)th; 
fold it over them, wipe them gently, and wjien they are qwti 



CHAP. XV.] VEOETABLEfl. 309 

diy put them into a clean stewpan with a good slice of butter, 
which should be just dissolved before the asparagus is added ; 
stew them in this over a biisk fire, shaking them t)ften, for eight 
or ten minutes ; dredge in about a small teaspoonful of flour, 
and add half that quantity of white sugar ; then pour in boiling 
water to nearly cover the asparagus, and boil it rapidly until but 
little liquid remains : stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs, heap 
the asparagus high in a dish, and serve it very hot. The sauce 
should adhere entirely to the vegetable as m green peas a la 
Franqaise, , 

TO BOIL GBEEN PEAS. 

To be eaten in perfection these should be young, very 
freshly gathered, and shelled just before they are boiled ; should 
there he great inequality in their size, the smaller ones may be 
separated from the others, and thrown into the saucepan four or 
five minutes later. Wash, and drain the peas in a cullender, 
put them into plenty of fast-boiling water, salted by the 
directions of page 300, keep the pan uncovered, and let them 
hoil rapidly untU they are tender ; drain them well, dish them 
quickly, and serve them very hot, with good melted butter in a 
tureen ; or put a slice of fresh butter into the midst of the peas, 
heap them well over it m the centre of the dish, and let it 
dissolve before they are disturbed. Never, on any ax^ount, 
hoil or mix mint with them unless it be expressly ordered,' as 
it is particularly distasteful to many persons. It shoidd be 
served in small heaps round them, if at all. 

15 to 25 minutes, or more if M. ^ 

gkeen peas a la fban^aise ; ob, french fashion. 

(entbsmets.) 

Throw a quart.of young and freshly-shelled peas into plenty 
of spring water with a couple of ounces of butter, and with the 
hand work them together until the butter adheres well to the 
peas ; lift them out, and drain them in a cullender ; put them 
into a stewpan or thick saucepan without any water, and let 
them remain over a gentle fire, and be stirred occasionally for 
twenty minutes from the time of their first begmning to sim- 
mer ; then pour to them as much boiling water as will just 
cover them ; throw in a small quantit^^ of salt, and keep them 
boiling quickly for forty minutes : stir well amongst them a 
small lump of sugar which has been dipped quickly into water, 
and a thickening of about half an ounce of butter very smoothly 
mixed with a teaspoonM of flour ; shake them over the fire for 



310 MODERN COOKERY. [CHiP. XT. 

a couple of minntes, and serve them directly heaped high in a 
very hot dish : there will be no sauce except that which adheres 
to the peas if they be properly managed. We have found mar- 
row fats excellent, dressed by this receipt. Fresh and good 
butter should be used with them alwa^rs. 

Peas, 1 quart ; butter, 2 ozs. : 20 minutes. Water to cover 
the peas ; little salt : 40 minutes. Sugar, small lump ; butter, 
) oz. ; flour, 1 teaspoonful : 2 minutes. 

OB£EN PEAS WITH.CBEAM. (eITTREMETS.) 

Boil a quart of young peas perfectly tender in salt and water, 
and drain them as dry as possible. Dissolve an ounce and a 
half of butter in a clean stewpan, stir' smoothly to it when it 
boils a dessertspoonful of flour, and shake these over the fire for 
three or four minutes, but vsdthout allowing them to take the 
slightest colour ; pour gradually to them a cup of rich cream, 
a4d a small lump of sygar pounded, let the sauce boil, then pat 
in the peas and toss them gently in it until they are very hot: 
dish, and serve them quickly. 

Peas, 1 quart: 18 to 25 minutes. Butter, 1| oz. ; flour, 1 
dessertspoonful : 3 to 5 minutes. Sugar, 1 saltspoonful ; cream, 
1 cupM. 

TO BOIL FBENCH BEANS. 

When the beans are very small and young, merely take off 
the ends and stalks, and drop them into plenty of spring water 
as they are done ; when aH are ready wash and drain them well, 
throw them into a large saucepan or fast-boiling water, salted as 
usual (see page 300), and when they are quite tender, which 
will be in &om twelve to eighteen mmutes, pour them into a 
cullender, shake the water from them, dish, and send them 
quickly to table with good melted butter in a tureen. When 
from half to two parts grown, cut the beans obliquely into a 
lozenge form, or, when a less modem fashion is preferred, split 
them lengthwise into delicate strips, and then cut them onoe 
across : the strings should be drawn off with the tops and stalks. 
No mode of dressing it can render this vegetable good when it 
is old, but if the sides be pared off, the beans cut thin, and boiled 
tender with rather more than the ordinary proportion of 8od»i 
they will be of excellent colour, and tolerably eatable. 

FBENCH BEANS X XA FBANQAISE. (eNTBEMETS.) 

Boil, and drain them thoroughly ; then put them into a clean 
stewpan, or well-tinned iron saucepan, and shake them over the 



CHAP. XV.] -VEGETABLES. 3 1 1 

fire until they are very dry and hot ; add to th^n from two to 
four ounces of fresh butter cut into small bits, some white 'pep- 
per, a little salt, and the juice of half a lemon; toss them gently 
for a few minutes over a clear fire, and serve them very hot. 
Should the butter turn to oil, a spoonful or two of veal gravy 
or boiling water must be added. 

AN EXCEIXENT BECEIPT FOB FBEMCH BEANS k LA FBAN^AISE. 

Prepare as many young and freshly-gathered beans as will 
sen'e for a large dish, boil them tender, and drsdn the water well 
from them. Melt » couple of ounces of fresh butter, in a clean 
saucepan, and stir smoothly to it a small dessertspoonful of flour ; 
keep these well shaken, and gently simmered until they are 
lightly browned, add salt and pepper, and pour to them by de- 
grees a small cupful of good vesd gravy (or, in lieu of this, of 
sweet rich cream), toss tne beans in the sauce until they are as 
.hot as possible ; stir quickly in, as they are taken from the fire, 
the beaten yolks of two fresh eggs, and a little lemon-juice, and 
serve them without delay. The eggs and lemon are sometimes 
omitted, and a tablespoonful of minced parsley is added to the 
butter and flour ; but this, we think, is scarcely an improvement. 

Beans, 1 to 2 quarts: boiled 15 to 20 minutes. Butter, 2 ozs. ; 
flour, 1 dessertspoonfrd ; salt and pepper; veal gravy, small 
cupful ; yolks of eggs, 2 ; lemon-juice, a dessertspoonful. 

TO BOIL WINDSOR BEANS. 

When young, freshly gathered, and well dressed, these beans, 
even with many persons accustomed to a luxurious table, are a 
fayoorite accompaniment to a dish of streaked bacon, or delicate 
pickled pork. Shell them only just before they are wanted, then 
wash, drain, and throw them into boiling water, salted as for 
peas. When they are quite tender, pour them into a hot cul- 
lender, drain them thoroughly, and send them to table quickly, 
with % tureen of parsley and butter, or with plain melted butter, 
when it is preferred. A boiled cheek of bacon, trimmed free 
of any blackened parts, may be dished over the beans, upon 
occasion. 

20 to 30 minutes ; less, when very young. 

Obg. — ^When the skin of the beans appears wrinkled, Ihev will 
generally be found sufficiently tender to serve, but they should 
be tasted to ascertain that they are so. 

DRESSED CUCUMBERS.

them, and when they have stood a few minntes, drain off the 
water, hy raising one side of the dish, and letting it flow to the 
other ; pour it away, strew more salt, and a moderate seasoning 
of pepper on them, add two or three tahlespoonsful of the 
purest salad-oil, and turn the cucumhers well, that the whole 
may receive a portion of it ; then pour over them from one to 
three dessertspoonsful of Chili vinegar, and a little common, 
should it be needed; turn them into a clean dish and serve 
them. 

06*. — If very young, cucumbers are usually dressed without 
being pared, but the tough rind of frill-^own ones being ex- 
tremely indigestible, should be avoided. The vegetable, though 
apt to disagree with persons of delicate habit, when sauced in 
the conmion English mode, with salt, pepper, and vin^ar only, 
may often be eaten by them with impunity when dressed with 
plenty of oil. It is difficult to obtain this perfectly fresh and 
pure here; and hence, perhaps, arises in part the pfejudice- 
which, amongst us, is so often K>und to exist against the use of 
this most wholesome condiment. 

MANDBANG, OB MANDBAM. 

(fVest Indian RecetpL) 

Chop together very small, two moderate-sized cucmnbers, 
with half the quantity of mild onion ; add the juice of a lemon, 
a saltspoonful or more of salt, a third as much of cayenne, and 
one or two glasses of Madeira, or of any other dry white vrine. 
This preparation is to be served with any kind of roast meat 

ANOTHEB BECEIPT FOB MANDBAM. 

Take three or four cucumbers, so young as not to require 
paring ; score the ends well, that when they are sliced they may 
fall into small bits ; add plenty of young onions, cut fine, the 
juice of half a lemon, a glass of eherry or Madeira, and a dessert- 
spoonful of ChiH vinegar. 

DBESSSD CUCUMBEBS. 

(AtUhor^s RecetpU) 

Cut into lengths of an inch or rather more, one or two freshly 
gathered cucumbers, take off the rind, and then pare them 
round and round into thin ribbons, until the watery part is 
reached: — this is to be thrown aside. When aU are dwei 
sprinkle them with cayenne and fine salt, and leave Uiem to 
drain a little ; then arrange them lightly in a clean dish, and 



I 



CHAP. XT.] VEGETABLES. 313 

sauce them with very fine oil, well mixed with Chili vin^ar, or 
mth equal parts of Chili and of common vinegar. 

Cucumbers, 2 or 3; salt, 1 to 2 saltspoonsful ; little cayenne; 
oO, 6 to 8 tablespoonsM; Chili vinegar, or equal parts of this 
and common vinegar, 2 to 4 tablespoonsful. 

06#.— When the flavour of eschalots is much liked, a tea- 
spoonful or more of the vinegar in which they have been 
steeped or pickled may be added to this dish. 

STEWED CUCUMBEBS. 

{English mode,) 

Pare, and split into quarters, four or five full-grown but still 
young cucumbers ; take out the seeds and cut each part in two ; 
sprinkle them with white pepper or cayenne, flour and fry them 
lightly iQ a httle butter, lift them from the pan, drain them on 
a sieve, then lay them into as much good brown gravy as will 
n^ly cover them, and stew them gently from twenty-five to 
thirty minutes, or until they are quite tender. Should the 
gravy require to be thickened or flavoured, dish the cucumbers 
and keep them hot while a little flour and butter, or any other 
of the usual ingredients, is stirred into it. Some persons like a 
small portion of lemon-juice, or of Chili vinegar added to the 
sauce ; cucumber vinegar might be substituted for these with 
very^od effect, as the vegetable loses much of its fine and 
peculiar flavour when cooked. 

25 to 30 minutes. 

Obs. — The cucumbers may be left in entire lengths, thrown 
mto well-salted boiling water, and simmered for ten minutes, 
then thoroughly drained upon the back of a sieve, and after- 
wards stewed very quickly till tender in some highly-flavoured 
brown gravy, or in the Spanish sauce of page 88. 

CUCUMBERS A £A FOULETTE. 

The cucumbers for this dish may be pared and sliced very 
thin ; or quartered, freed fix)m the seeds, and cut into half-inch 
lengths ; in either case they should be steeped in a little vinegar 
and sprinkled with salt* for half an hour before they are 
dressed. Drain, and then press them dry in a soft cloth ; flour them 
wdi, put a slice of. butter into a stewpan or saucepan bright in 
the inside, and when it begins to boU throw in the cucumbers, 
and shake them over a gentle fire for ten minutes, but be 
careful to prevent their taking the slightest colour; pour to 
them gradually as much strong, but very pale, veal stock or 
gravy as will hearly coyer them ; when it boils skim off the fat

entirely, add salt and white pepper, if needed, and when the 
cucumbers are quite tender, strew in a large teaspoonful of 
finely-minced parsley, and thicken the sauce with the yolks of two 
oi' three eggs. French cooks add the flour when the vegetable 
has stewed in the butter, instead of dredging it upon them at 
first, and this is perhaps the better method. 

CUCUMBERS k JJL CBSmE. 

Boil them tolerably tender in salt and water, drain them well, 
then stew them for a few minutes in a thick bechamel, and 
serve them in it. 

FRIED CUCUMBERS TO SERVE IN COMMON HASHES AND MIFCES. 

If very young they need not be pared, but otherwise, take 
off the rind, slice, and dredge them lightly with pepper and 
flour, but put no salt at first ; throw them into very hot butter 
or clarified dripping, or they will not brown ; when they are 
nearly done sprmkle some salt amongst them, and as soon as 
they are quite tender, lift them out with a slice, drain them 
well, and place them lightly over the hash or mince. A small 
portion of onion may be fiied with them when it is liked. 

MELON. 

This in France and in other parts of the Continent is served 
and eaten with the bouilli (or beef boiled tender in the soufj- 
pot), with a seasoning of salt and pepper only ; but the fiiiit is 
there far more abundant, and of infinitely finer growth than 
with us, and requires so little care, comparatively, that it is 
planted in many places in the open fields, where it flourishes 
admirably. 

SALAD. 

The herbs and vegetables for a salad cannot be too fi:e5hl7 
gathered ; they shoiud be carefully cleared from insects and 
washed with scrupulous nicety; they are better when not 
prepared until near the time of sending them to table, and should 
not be sauced until the instant before" they are served. • Tender 
lettuces, of which the outer leaves should be stripped away, 
mustard and cress, young radishes, and occasionally chives or 
small green onions (when the taste of a party is in favour of 
these last) are the usual ingredients of summer salads. Half- 
grown cucumbers sliced thin, and mixed with them, are » 
favourite addition with many persons. In England it » 
customary to cut the lettuces extremely fine; thfe French, who 



CHAP, xy.] VEGETABLES. 815 

object to the flavour of the kntfe, which they fancy this mode 
imparts, break them small instokl. Yomig celery alone, sliced 
and dressed with a rich salad mixture (see page 111) is excel- 
lent: it is still in some. families served thus always with roast 
pheasants. 

Beet-root, baked or boiled, blanched endive, small salad- 
herbs which are easily raised at any time of the year, celery, 
*nd hardv lettuces, with any ready-dressed vegetable will 
supply salads through the winter. Cucumber vmegar is an 
igreeable addition to these. 

FRENCH SALAD. 

In winter this is made principally of beautifully-blanched 
endlTe, washed delicately clean and broken into small branches 
with the fingers, then taken from the water and shaken dry in 
a basket kept for the purpose, or in a fine cloth ; then arranged 
in the salad-bowl, and strewed with herbs (tarragon generally, 
when in season) minced small : the dressing is not added until 
jnst before the salad is eaten. In summer, young lettuces 
9K substituted for the endive, and intermixed with a va* 
riety of herbs, some of which are not generally cultivated in 
England. 

SUFFOLK* SALAD. 

Fill a salad-bowl from half to three parts full with very 
tender lettuces shred small, minced lean of ham, and hard- 
boiled eggs, or their yolks only, also minced, placed in alternate 
layers ; ^ess the mixture with English salad-sauce, but do not 
pour it into the bowl until the instant of serving. A portion 
of cold chicken, cut in thin slices about the size of a stulling, 
niay be added when convenient. 

TOBKSHIBE FL01I6HMAN*S SALAD. 

Mix treacle and vinegar, in the proportion of one tablespoon- 
ful of the first to two of the latter ; add a little black pepper, 
and eat the sauce with lettuces shred small (with an intermix- 
ture of young onions when they are liked). This, though cer- 
tainly not a very refined order of salad, is scarcely so unpalat- 
able as such ingredients would seem to promise. 

DES GEBNEAUX, OB WALNUT SALAD. 

This is a common summer salad in France, where there is 
generally an abundant growth of walnuts, though it is not, we 
believe, much served in England. Take the fruit when a pin 
will pierce it easily, and pare it down to the kernel ; put it into 



316 MODERN COOKERY. QcBAP. SV. 

a salad-bowl witb either a French or an English dressing, and 
toss the whole gently before it is served. 

TO BOIL CAUIJPI.OWEBS. 

Trim off the outside leaves, and cut the stems quite dose to 
the cauliflowers ; let them lie for an hour in plenty of cold 
water, with a handful of salt in it, to draw out any insects that 
may be amongst them ; then wash them very thoroughly, and 
examine them well, to be assured that no snail is left in any 
part of them, throw them into a large pan of boiling water, 
salted as for asparaeus, and quite cleared from scum ; tor this, 
if not removed, will adhere to the cauliflowers and spoil their 
appearance. When the stalks are tender lift them out, dish 
them neatly, and send good melted butter to table with them. 

20 to 30 minutes. 

CAULIFLOWERS. 

(French Receipt.) 

Gut the cauliflowers into small handsome tufts, and boil 
them until three parts done, drain them well, toss them for a mo- 
ment in some thick melted butter or white sauce, and set them 
by to cool. When they are quite cold, dip them separately into 
tne batter of page 154, fry them a light brown, arrange them 
neatly in a dish, and serve them very hot 

CAULIFLOWERS WITH PARMESAN CHEESE. 

Take all the green leaves from two or three fine white cauli- 
flowers, and cut the stalks off very closely, so that they will 
stand upright in the dish in which they are served ; boil them 
tolerabty tender, but not sufficiently so to hazard their break- 
ing, drain them well, and dish them, so as to give the whole 
the appearance of one cauliflower, pour a little good white sauce 
equally over the tops, and on this strew grated rarmesan cheese, 
drop over it a little clarified butter, add another layer of 
cheese, and cover the whole with the finest bread-cmmbs; 
moisten these with more clarified butter, and brown them with s 
salamander, or set the dish into the oven, to give them colour; 
pour white sauce round the cauliflowers, and send them very 
not to table. 

CAULIFLOWERS A LA FRANI^AISE. 

Strip away all the green leaves, and divide each cauliflower 

Mnto three or four parts, trimming the stalks quite close ; put 

them, with the heads downwards, into a stewpan which will juat 

hold them, half filled with boiling water, into which an ounce 



CHAP. XT,] VEGETABLES. 317 

• 

of good butter and some salt have previously been thrown ; so 
soon as they are quite tender, drain the water firom them,, place 
a dish over the stewpan and turn it gently upside down ; arrange 
the vegetables neatly in the form of one large cauliflower and 
oorer it with good melted butter, into whidb a little lemon-juice 
has been stirred. 
12 to 18 minutes. 

BBOCCOLI. 

This is boiled, and served in the same manner as cauliflowers 
when the heads are large ; the stems of the branching broccoli 
are peeled, and the vegetable, tied in bunches, is dressed and 
served, like asparagus, upon a toast. 

10 to 20 minutes. 

TO BOIL ARTICHOKES. 

After they have been soaked and well washed, cut off the stems 
quite close, trim away a few of the lower leaves, and clip the 
pomts of all ; throw the artichokes into plenty of fast-boiling 
water, ready salted and skimmed, with the addition, if it be at 
hand, of the proportion of soda directed in pa^e 300, as this 
will greatly improve the colour of the vegetable. When ex- 
tremely young, the artichokes will be tender in from half to 
three quarters of an hour, but they will require more than 
double that time when at their full gro^h : when the leaves 
can be drawn out easily they are done. Send good melted 
butter to table with them. They should be boiled alwa3rs with 
the stalk-ends uppermost. 

Very young, i to i hour ; fall-grown, 1^ to 2 hours. 

Obs. — French cooks lift the tops jfrom the artichokes before 
they are served, and replace them after having taken out the 
chokes : this must be expeditiously do^e to prevent the vege- 
table from cooling. 

ARTICHOKES EN SA]>AD]5. 

Wash, soak, and drain some very young and tender arti- 
chokes (they should not have attained more than a third of 
their growth), cut off the stalks close, quarter them, and send 
them to table with a little water in the dish. The chokes will 
be scarcely formed, and the remainder of the vegetable will 
have almost the flavour of fresh walnuts : it is constantly served 
thus in France as a hors (fomvref

VEGETABLE MABROW. 

It is customary to gather this when not larger thain a turkey's 
egg, but we should say that the vegetable is not then in its 
perfection. The flesh is whiter and of better flavour when the 
gourd is about six inches long; at least we have fotmd it so 
with the kinds which have fallen under our observation. It 
may either be boiled in the skin, then pared, halved, and 
served upon a toast ; or quartered, freed from the seed, and left 
until cold, then dipped into egg and fine crumbs of bread, and 
fried ; or it may be cut into dice, and reheated in a little good 
white sauce; or stewed tender in butter, and served in well- 
thickened veal gravy, flavoured with a little lemon-juice. It may 
likewise be maSbed by the receipt which we have given for tur- 
nips, and in that form will be found excellent. The French 
make a fanciful dish of the marrows thus: they boil them 
tender in water, and halve them lengthwise as is usual, they 
then slice a small bit oif each to make them stand evenly in 
the dish, and after having hollowed the insides, so as to leave a 
mere shell, about half an inch thick, they fill them with a 
thick rich mince of white meat, and pour white sauce round 
them ; or they heap fried crumbs over the tops, place the dish in 
the oven for a few minutes, and serve them without sauce. 

Size of turkey's egg, 10 to 15 minutes ; moderate-sized, 20 
to 30 ; large, f to 1 hour. 

TOAfiLTAS EN SAIADE. 

These are now often served in England in the American 
fashion, merely sliced, and dressed like cucumbers, with salt, 
pepper, oil, and vinegar. For various other American modes 
of preparing them for table, see tomata dumplings, Chap- 
ter X vn. 

BOAST TOMATAS. 

To serve with roast leg, loin, or shotdder of mutton. 

Select them nearly •of the same size, take off the stalks, and 
roast them gently in a Dutch oven, or if more convenient, 
place them at the edge of the dripping-pan, taking care that no 
fat from the joint shall fall upon them, and keeping them 
turned that they may be equally done. From ten to fourteen 
minutes will roast them. 

STEWED TOMATAS. 

Arrange them in a single layer, and pour to them as much 



CHAP. XV.] VEGETABLES. 819 

gravy as will reach to half their height ; stew them very softly 
until the under sides are done, then turn, and finish stewing 
them. Thicken the gravy with a little arrow-root and cream, 
or with flour and butter, and serve it round them. 

FORCED TOMATAS. 

(English Receipt.) 

Cut the stems quite close, slice off the tops of eight fine 
tomatas, and scoop out the insides ; press the pulp through a 
sieve, and mix with it one ounce of fine crumbs of bread, one of 
butter, broken ver^ small, some pepper, or cayenne, and salt. 
Fill the tomatas with the mixture, and bake them ten minutes 
in a moderate oven ; serve them with brown gravy in the dish. 
A few small mushrooms, i stewed tender in a little butter, then 
minced and added to the tomata pulp, will very much improve 
this receipt. 

Baked 10 minutes. 

FORCED TOMATAS. 

(French Receipt,) 
Let the tomatas be well shaped and of equal size; divide 
them nearly in the middle, leaving the blossom-side the 
largest, as this onl^ is tb be used; empty them carefiilly of 
their seeds and jmce, and fill them with the following ingre- 
dients, which must previously be stewed tender in butter, but 
without being allowed to brown : minced mushrooms and sha- 
lots, with a moderate proportion of parsley, some lean of ham 
chopped small, a seasoning of cayenne, and a little fine salt, if 
needed ; let them cool, then mix with them about a third as 
much of fine crumbs of bread, and two yolks of eggs ; fill the 
tOMiatas, cover them with fine crumbs, moisten them with clari- 
fied butter, and bake them in a brisk oven until they are well 
coloured. Serve them as a garnish to stewed rump or sirloin 
of beef, or to a boned and forced leg of mutton. 

Minced lean of ham, 2 ozs. ; mushrooms, 2 ozs. ; bread- 
crumbs, 2 ozs.; shalote, 4 to 8; parsley, full teaspoonful; 
cayenne, quarter saltspoonful ; little salt, if needed ; butter, 
2 ozs. ; yolks of eggs, 2 to 3 : baked, 10 to 20 minutes. 

Ohs. — The French pound the whole of these ingredients 
with a bit of garlic, before they fill the tomatas with them, but 
this is not ab£>lutely necessary, and the garlic, if added at all, 
should be parboiled first, as its strong flavour, combined with 
that of the eschalots, would ^ scarcely suit the general taste. 
When the lean of a dressed ham is at hand, only the herbs and 
vegetables will need to be stewed in the butter ; this should be 



320 MODERN OOOKERT. [CHAP. XT. 

mixed with them into' the forcemeat, which an intelligent cook 
will yaiy in many ways. 

FUSiis OF TOMATAS. 

Divide a dozen fine ripe tomataa, squeeze ont the seeds, 
and take off the stalks ; put them with one small mild onion 
(or more, if liked), and about half a pint of very good gravy, 
into a well-tinned stewpan or saucepan, and simmer them for 
nearly or quite an hour; a couple of bay-leaves, some cayenne, 
and as much salt as the dish mav require should be added 
when th^ begin to boil. Press them through a sieve, hi&X 
them again, and stir to them a quarter-pint of good cream, pre- 
viously mixed and boiled for five minutes with a teaspoonfiu of 
flour. This pur6e is to be served with calTs head, veal cutlets, 
boiled knuckle of veal, calf's brains, or beef palates. For 
pork, beef, geese, and other brown meats, the tomatas should be 
reduced to a proper consistency in rich and highly-flavoured 
brown gravy, or Spanish sauce. 

MUSHBOOMS AU BEUBBE. 

Cut the stems from some fine meadow mushroom-buttons, 
and clean them with a bit of new flannel, and some fine salt, 
then either wij)e them dry with a soft cloth, or rinse them in 
firesh water, drain them qmckly, spread them in a clean doth, 
fold it over them, and leave them ten minutes, or more, to 
dry. For every pint of them thus prepared, put an ounce and 
a half of fresh butter into a tliick iron saucepan, dhake it over 
the fire until li just begins to brown, throw m the mushrooms, 
continue to shake the saucepan over a clear fire, that they mky 
not stick to it, nor bum, and when they have sinunered three 
or four minutes, strew over them a little salt, some cayenne, 
and pounded mace ; stew them until they are perfectly tender, 
heap them in a dish, and serve them with their own sauce only, 
for breakfast, supper, or luncheon. Nothing can be finer than 
the flavour of the mushrooms thus prepared ; and the addition 
of any liquid is far from an improvement to it. They are very 
good when drained from the butter, and served cold, and in a 
cool larder may be kept for several days. The butter in which 
they are stewed is admirable for flavouring gravies, sauces, or 
potted meats. Small flaps, freed from the fhr and skin, may 
be stewed in the same way ; and either these, or the buttons, 
sened under roast poultry or partridges, will give a dish (rf* 
very superior relish. 



i 



CHAP. XV.J TEGETABLES. 821 

Meadow muslirooms, 3 pints, fresh butter, 4^ ozs. : «3 to 5 
minutes. Salt, 1 small teaspoonful ; mace, half as much ; ca- 
yenne, third of saltspoonful : 10 to 15 minutes. More spices to 
be added, if required — much depending on their quality ; but 
they should not overpower the flavour of the mushrooms. 

06*.— Persons inhabiting parts of the country where mush- 
rooms are abundant, may send them easily, when thus pre- 
pared (or when potted by the following receipt), to their 
fnends in cities, or in less productive counties. If poured into 
jars, ifith sufficient butter to cover Chem, they will travel any 
distance, and can be rewarmed for use. 

POTTED MUSHBOOMS. 

Prepare eith^ small flaps or buttons with great nicety, 
without wetting them, and wipe the former very dry, after the 
application of the salt and &innel. Stew them quite tender, 
with the same proportion of butter as the mushrooms au 
beurre, but increase a little the quantity of spice ; when they 
are done turn them into a large dish, spread them over one end 
of it, and raise it two or three inches that they may be well 
drained (rom the butter. As soon as they are quite cold, press 
them very closely into small potting-pans ; pour lukewarm 
clarified butter thicklv over them, and store them in a cool dry 
place. If intended for present use, merely turn them down 
Qpon a clean dielf ; but for longer keeping," cover the tops first 
with very dry paper, and then with melted mutton-suet. We 
uave ourselves had the mushrooms, alter beins simply spread 
upon a dish while hot, remain perfectly good m that state for 
seven or eight weeks : they were prepared late in the season, 
and the weather was consequently cool during the interval. 

MUSHBOOM-TOAST, OB CBOUTB AUX GHAMPIGSOKS. 

{Excellent,) 

Out the stems closely from a quart, or more, of small just- 
opened mushrooms, peel them, and take out the fur. Dissolve 
from two to three ounces of fresh butter in a well-tinned 
saucepan or stewpan ; put in the mushrooms, strew over them a 
quarter- teaspoonful or pounded mace mixed with a little cayenne, 
and let them stew over a gentle' fire from ten to fifteen minutes ; 
toss or stir tnem often during the time; then add a small 
dessertspoonful of flour, and shake the pan round until it is 
%htly browned. Next pour in, by slow degrees, half a pint 
of gravy or of good beef-broth ; and when the mushrooms have 
stewed softly in this for a couple of minutesi throw in a little

salt, and a squeeze of lemon-juioe, and pour them on to a crust, 
eut about an inch and a quarter thick, from the under part of a 
moderate-sized loaf, and firied in good butter a light brown, 
after having been first slightly hollowed in the inside. New 
milk, or thm cream, may be used with very good effect instead 
of the gravy; but a few strips of lemon-rind, and a small por- 
tion of nutmeg and mushroom-catsup should then be sMed to 
the sauce. The bread may be buttered and grilled over a gentle 
fire instead of being fried, and is better so. 

Small mushrooms, 4 to 5 half pints; butter, 3 to 4 ozs.; 
mace, mixed with a little cayenne, i teaspoonM : stewed softly 
10 to 15 minutes. * Flour, 1 small dessertspoonfrd : 3 to 5 
minutes. Gravy or broth,* i pint : 2 minutes. Little salt and 
lemon-juice. 

TBUITLES. 

» 

The truffle is^so scantily produced in Ei^land, and it is so 
expensive, even in the countries where it is both of finer and 
more abundant growth, that it is little served here as a vegetable, 
except at the t^les of the wealthier classes. As we cannot, fix)in 
our own experience, give receipts for dressing it, in the various 
modes which follow we cite the best French authority on the 
subject.* 

TRUFFLES WUH CHAMPAGNE, A LA 8EBVIETTE. 

Select the finest truffles for this dish, be particular in smeUing 
them, and reject any that have a musty smell. Wash and brush 
them well with cold water only, change it several times, and 
When they are perfectly clean line a stewpan with slices of 
bacon ; put in the truffles with a bunch of parsley, green onions, 
and thyme, two or three bay-leaves, half a dozen doves, and a 
little sweet basil; pour in sufficient rich veal gravy to cover 
them, with the addition of from half a pint to ludf a bottle of 
champagne ; boil them very softly for an hour, then draw fliem , 
aside and let them cool in the grav^. Heat them afresh in it 
when they are wanted for table ; lift them out and drain them 
in a very clean cloth, and dish them neatly in a fine and beau- 
tifully white napkin, which shall contrast as strongly as possible 
With the dark hue of the truffles.

TBUTFLES A L*ITAU£NNE. 

Wash perfectly dean, wipe, and pare some truffles as thin b$ 
possible; slice them ahout the size of a penn^ ; put them into a 
saate-pan (or small &ying-pan), with a sbce of fresh butter, 
some minced parsley and eschalot, salt and pepper ; put them 
on the fire and stir them, that they may fry equally ; when 
they are done, which will be in about ten minutes, drain off 
part of the butter, and throw in a bit of fresh, a small ladleful 
of Spanish sauce (see paffe 88), the juice of one lemon, and a 
little cayenne pepper. This is a dish of high relish. 

TO BOIL SFBOUTS, CABBAGES, SAYOTS, liETTUCES, OB SNDIYS. 

All ereen y^etables should be thrown into abundance of 
&st bomng water ready salted and skimmed, with the ad^tion 
of the morsel of soda which we have recommended, in a pre- 
vious page of this chapter ; the pan should be left uncovered, 
and every precaution taken to prevent the smoke from reaching 
its contents. Endive, sprouts, and spring greens, will only re- 
quire copious washing before they are boiled ; but savoys, large 
lettuces, and close-leaved cabbages should be thrown into salt 
and water for half an hour or more before they are dressed, 
with the tops downwards to draw out the insects. The stems of 
these last should be cut off, the decaved leaves stripped away, 
and the vegetable halved or quartereo, or split deeply across the 
stalk-end, and divided entirely before it is dished. 

Very young greens, 15 to 20 mmutes ; lettuces, 20 to 30 
minutes; large savoys, or cabbages, 1 to 1^ hour, or more. 

Obs, — ^When the stelk of any kind of cabbage is tender, it 
is done. Tumip-^reens should be well washed in several 
waters, and boiled m a very large quantity to deprive them of 
their bitterness. 

STEWED CABBAGE. 

Cut out the stalk entirely, and slice a fine firm cabbage or 
two in very thin strips ; throw them after they have been well 
washed and drained, into a large pan of boiling watd: ready 
salted and skimmed, and when they are tender, which will be in 
from ten to fifteen minutes, pour them into a sieve or strainer, 
VKB8 the water thoroughly&om them, and chop them slightly. 
Put into a very clean saucepan about a couple of ounces of 
butter, and when it is dissolved add the cabbage, with sufilcient 
pepper and salt to season, it, and stir it over a clear fire until it 
appears tolerably dry ; then shake lightly in a tablespoonfiil of

flour, turn the ^hole well, and add by slow d^prees a cup of 
thick cream : yeal gravy or good white sauce may be substituted 
^r this, when preferred to it. 

TO son* TUBKIPS. 

Pare entirely from them the stringy rind, and either split the 
turnips once or leave them whole ; throw them into boiling 
water slightly salted, and keep them closely covered from smoke 
and dust till they are tender. When small and young they 
will be done in from fifteen to twenty minutes ; at their fall 
growth they will require Irom three quarters to a tail hour, 
or more, of gentle boiling. After they become old and woolly 
they are not worth dressing in any way. When boiled in their 
s^ins and pared afterwards, they are said to be of better flavour 
and much less wat€;;iy than when cooked in the usual way. 

Young turnips, 15 to 20 minutes : full grown, f to 1 hoar, or 
more. 

TO MASH TUBNIPS, , 

Split them once or even twice should they be large ; after 
they are pared, boil them very tender, and press the water 
thoroughly from them with a ample of trenchers, or with the 
back of a large plate and one trencher. To ensure their being 
free from lumps, it is better to pass them through a cullender 
or coarse hair-sieve, with a wooden spoon; thou^i, when quttt* 
young, thej may be worked sufficiently smooth without this. 
Put them mto a clean saucepan, and stir them constantly for 
some minutes over a gentle fire, that they may be veiy dry; 
then add sonae salt, a bit of fresh butter, and a little cream, or 
in lieu of this new milk (we would also recommend a seasoning 
of white pepper or cayenne, when a^^iearance and fashion are 
not particularly regarded), and continue to simmer and to stir 
them for five or six minutes longer, or until they have quite 
absorbed all the liquid which has been poured to theuL Serve 
them always as hot as possible. This is an excellent reodpt 

Turnips, weighed after they are par^ 3 lbs. : dried 5 to S 
minutes. Salt, 1 teaspoonftil ; butter, 1 oz. to li oz. ; cream or

TUBNIPS IN WHITE SAUCE. (eNTBEBCETS.) 

When no scoop for the purpose is at hand, cut some small 
finely-grained turnips into quarters, and pare them into bails, 
or into the shape of plums or pears of equal size ; arrange them 
evenly in a broad stewpan or saucepan, and cover them nearly

sugar, and boil them rather quickly until they are auite tender, 
but unbroken; lift them out, draining them wdl from the

an economy, a cup of cream, and a teaspoonftd of arroivroot, 
nav be adaedto tne broth in which the tumins haye stewed, to 
make the sauce ; and when it boils, a small shoe of butter may 
be stirred and well worked into it, should it not be su£5idently 
lich without 

TUJUNIPS STBWBn IN BUTTER. (gOOD.) 

This is an excellent way of dressing the vegetable when it is 
mild and finely grained ; but its flavour othervnse is too strong 
to be agreeable. After the^ have been waslied, wiped quite 
diy, and pared, slice the turnips nearly half an inch thick, and 
divide them into dice. Just dissolve an ounce of butter for 
each half-pound of the tumi})s, put them in as flat as they can 
be, and stew them very gently mdeed, from three quarters of 
an hoar to a fall hour. Add a seasoning of salt and white 
pepper when they are half done. "When thus prepared, they 
may be dished over fried or nicely broiled mutton cutlets, or 
served by themselyes. 

For a small dish ; turnips, U lb. ; butter, 3 ozs. ; seasoning of 
white pepper; salt, ) teaspoonfdl, or more : | to 1 hour. Large 
^'^ turnips, 2 lbs. ; butter, 4 ozs. 



TUBinPS IN GXAVT. 

To a pound of turnips sliced and cut into dice, pour a quar- 
ter-pint of boiling veal gravy, add a small limip of su^r, some 
salt and cayenne, or white pepper, and boil them quickly from. 
fi% to siz^ minutes. Serve tnem very hot. 

TO BOIL CABBOTS. 

Wash the mould from them, and scrape the skin off lightly 
^th ^e edge of a sharp knife, or, should this be object^ to, 
pare them as thin and as equally as possible ; in either case fr«e 
them from all blemishes, and should they be very large, spUt 
them across the tops a few inches down ; rinse them well, and 
throw them into plenty of boiling water with some salt in it. 
The skin of very young carrots may be rubbed off like that of 
new potatoes, and from twenty to uiirtv minutes will then be 
sufficient to boil them ; but at their frill growth they will re- 
quire from an hour and a half to two hours. It was formerly" 
toe custom to tie them in a doUt* and to wipe the skin from

them with it after they were dressed ; and old'&shioned cooks 
still use one to remove it ; but all vegetables should, we think, 
be dished and served vdth the least possible delay after they 
are ready for table« Melted butter should accompany boiled 
carrots. 

Very young carrots> 20 to 30 minutes. Full-grown ones, 1} 
to 2 hours. 

CABBOTS. (smrB^E.) 
{The Windsor Receipt,') 

Select some good carrots of equal size, and cut the up^ 
parts into even lengths of about two inches and a hal^ then trim 
one end of each into a pointy so as to give the carrot the fonn 
of a sugar-loaf.* When all are readjr, throw them into plenty 
of ready-salted boiling water, and boil them three quarters of 
an hour. Lift them out, and drain them well, then arrange 
them upright, and all on a level in a broad stewpan or sauce- 
pan, and pour in good hot beef-broth, or veal gravy to half 
their height ; add as much salt as may be needed, and a small 
teaspoonful of sugar, and boil them briskly for half an hour, 
or longer, should they require it. Place- them again upright in 
dishing them, and keep them hot while a little good bromi 
gravy is thickened to pour over them, and mixed with a large 
teaspoonftil of parsley and a little lemon-juice ; or sauce them 
with conunon bechamel (see page 97), or white sauce, with or 
without the addition of paralej^. 

Thick part of carrots cut m cones : boiled f hour. With 
gravy or broth, little salt and sugar : i horn*, or more. Sauce: 
thickened gravy, bechamel made without meat, or common 
white sauce. 

Obs. — The carrots dressed thus are exceedingly good without 
an^ sauce, beyond the small quantity of liquid which will re- 
main in the stewpan with them ; or with a few spoons^ more 
of gravy added to this, and thickened with butter and a little 
flour. 

SWEET CABBOTS. (eNTBEMSTS.) 

Boil quite tender some fine highly-flavoured carrots, press 
the water from them, and rub them through the back of a 
fine hair-sieve; put them into a clean saucepan or stewpan, 
and dry them thoroughly over a gentle fire ; then add a alice of 
fresh butter, and when this is dissolved and well mixed with 
them, strew in a dessertspoonful or more of powdered sugar, 

* See pl(ite, page 290, 



CHAP. XT.] VE66TABLES. 327 

and a little salt ; next, stir in by decrees some good cream, and' 
when this is quite absorbed, and the carrots again appear dry, 
dish and serve them quickly with small sippets, a la Reme (see 
page 5), placed round them. 

Carrots, 3 lbs., boiled quite tender : stirred over a gentle fire 
^ to 10 minutes. Butter, 2 ozs.; salt, ^ teaspoon^; pounded 
sugar, 1 dessertspoon^ ; cream, ^ pint, stewed gently together 
until quite dry. 

06«.— For excellent mashed carrots omit the sugar, add a 
good seasoning of salt and white pepper, and half a pint of rich 
brown gravy; or for a {dain dmner rather less than this of 
loilk. 

CABBOTS AU BEUBBE, OB BUTTEBED CABBOTS. 

Either boil sufficient carrots for a dish quite tender, and then 
cnt them into slices a quarter-inch thick, or first slice, and then 
boil them : the latter method is the most expeditious, but the 
other best preserves the flavour of the vegetable. Drain them 
well, and \mile this is being done just dissolve from two to four 
ounces of butter in a saucepan, and strew in some minced 
parsley, some salt, and white pepper or cayenne ; then add the 
carrots, and toss them very gently until they are equally 
covered with the sauce, which should not be allowed to boU : 
the parsley may be omitted at pleasure. Cold carrots may be 
J^warmed in this way. 

TO BOTL PABSNEPS. 

These are dressed in precisely the same manner as carrots, 
bnt require much less boiling. According to their quality and 
the time of year, they will take from twenty minutes to nearly 
an hour. Every speck or blemish should be cut from them 
after they are scraped, and the water in which they are boiled 
shoidd be well skimmed. They are a favourite accompaniment 
to salt-fish and boiled pork, and may be served either mashed 
or plain. 

20 to 65 minutes. 

IBIED PABSNEPS. 

Boil them until they are about half done, lift them out, and 
let them cool ; slice uiem rather thickly, sprinkle them with 
fine salt and white pepper, and fry them a pale brown in good 
butter. Serve them with roast meat, or dish them under it.

they are done into a sanoroan of cold water, or of ecpoal parts 
of milk and water ; and when they are about half b<nled add a 
little salt to them. Take them up the instant they are perfectly 
tender : this will be in from fifteen to twenty-five minutes, so 
much do they vary as to the time necessary to dress them. If 
allowed to remain in the water after they are done, they become 
black and flavourless. Melted butter should sdways be seat to

Boil them fix)m eight to twelve minutes ; lift them out, drain 
them on a sieve, and let them cool; dip them into beaten eggs, 
and cover them with fine bread-crumbs. Fry them a light 
brown, drain, pile them in a hot dish, and serve them quickly.

flat, and trim the^ other into a point ; boil them in milk and 
water, lift them out the instant they are done, place them 
upright in the dish in which they are to be served, and sauce 
tnem with a good bechamel, or with nearly half a pint of 
cream thickened with a small dessertspoonfol of flour, mixed 
with an ounce and a half of butter, and seasoned with a little 
mace and some salt. When cream cannot be procured use new 
milk, and increase the proportion of flour and butter ; though 
the sauce thus made will serve only for a family dinner. 

BIASHBB JEBUSAIiEM ABTIGHOKES. . 

Boil them tender, press the water well from them, and then 
proceed exactly as for mashed turnips, taking care to dry the 
artichokes well, both before and after the milk or cream is 
added to them; they will be excellent if good white sauce is 
substituted for eitiier of these. 

HABIGOTS BLAITG9- 

The haricot blanc is the seed of a parlicular kind of Fieneh 
bean, of which we find some difficulty in ascertaining the 
English name, for though we have tried several which icsem- 
bled it in appearance, we have found the'r flavour, after they 
were dressed, veiy different, and far from agreeable. The hug^ 
white Dutch runner, is, we believe, the proper variety for

eookiiig ; at least we have obtained a small qiumtity nnder that 
name, which approached much more nearly than any others we 
had tried to those which we had eaten abroad. The haricots, 
when freshly harvested, may be thrown into plenty of boiling 
water, with some salt tnd a small bit of butter ; if old, they 
must be previously soaked for an hour or two, put into cold * 
water, brought to boil gently, and simmered until th^ are 
tender, for if boiled fast the skins will burst before the beans 
are done. Drain them thoroughly from the water when they 
are ready, and lay them into a dean saucepan over two or three 
ounces of fresh butter, a small dessertspoonful of chopped 
parsley, and sufficient salt and pepper to season the whole; 
then gently shake or toss the beems until they are quite hot 
and equally covered with the sauce ; add the strained juice of 
half a lemon, and serve them quickly. The vegetable thus 
dressed, is excellent ; and it affords a convenient resource in the 
season when the supply of other kinds is scantiest. ' In some 
conntries the dried b^ins are placed in water, over-night, upon ^ 
a stove (these invent^ by Dr. Amott* would, from the peitect ^ 
regulation of the heat, answer for the purpose better ihai^ 
most others, we apprehend), and by a very gentle degree o£ 
warmth are si^ciently softened by the following day to be 
served as follows : — they are drained from the water, spread on 
a dean cloth and wiped quite dry, then lightly floured and fried 
in oil or butter, with a seasoning of pepper and salt, lifred into 
a hot dish, and served under roast bee^ or mutton. 

TO BOIL BEBT SOOT. 

Wash the roots delicately clean, but neither scrape nor cut 
them, as not a fibre even shoidd be trimmed away, until after 
they are dressed. Throw them into boiling water, and accord- 
ing to their size boil them from one hour and a half to two hours 
and a half. Fare and serve them whole, or thickly sliced, and 
send melted butter to table with them. Beet-root is often 
mixed with winter salads ; and it makes a pickle of beautifril 
colour ; but one of the most usual modes of serving it at the 
present day is, with the cheese, cold and merely pared and 
siioed, after having been boiled or baked.

After it is lifted out, the thickest part ma7 be pressed with the

TO BAKE BEET ROOT. 

Beet root, if slowly and carefully baked until it is tender qaite 
through, is Very rich and sweet in flavour, although less bnght 
in<x)lour than when it is boiled: it is also, w« bebeve, remark- 
ably nutritious and wholesome. Wash and wipe it very dry, 
but neither cut nor break any part of it ; then lay it into a 
coarse dish, and bake it in a gentle oven for four or Ave hours : 
it will sometimes require even a longer time than this. Fare it 
quickly if to be served hot ; but leave it to cool first, when it is 
to be sent to table cold. 

The white beet root is dressed exactly like the red : the leaves 
of it are boiled and served like asparagus. 

In slow oven from 4 to 6 hours. 

STEWED BEET BOOT. 

Bake or boU it tolerably tender, and let it remain lintil it is 
cold, then pare and cut it into slices; heat and stew it for a short 
time in some good pale veal gravy (or in strong veal broth for 
ordinary occasions), thicken this with a teaspoonfiil of arroW' 
root, and half a cupful or more of good cream, and stir in, as it is 
taken from the fire, from 'a tea to a table spoonful of Chili vine 
gar. The beet root may be served likewise in thick white sauce, 
to which, iust before it is dished, the mild eschalots of page 164 
may be added. 

TO STEW BED CABBAGE. 

(^Flemish Receipt^ 

Strip the outer leaves firom a fine and fresh red cabbage ; wash 
it well, and cut it into the thinnest possible slices, beginning at 
the top ; put it into a thick saucepan in which two or three 
ounces of good butter have been just dissolved ; add some pepper 
and salt, and stew it very slowly indeed for three or four hours 
in its own juice, keeping it often stirred, and well pressed down. 
When it is perfectly tender add a tablespoonfiil of vin^ir; 
mix the whole up thoroughly, heap the cabbage in a hot osh, 
and serve broiled sausages round it; or omit these last, and 
substitute lemon-juice, cayenne pepper, and a half-cupfbl of 
^ood gravy. 

The stalk of the cabbage should be split in quarters and taken 
entirely out in the first instance. 

9 to 4 hours.

These delicate little sproats, or mimatare cabbages, sbonld be 
^bered when not larger than a common walnut, and after 
oemg trimmed free from any decayed leaves, and washed very 
thoroughly, should be thrown into a pan of water properly 
sdted, and boiled from eight to ten minutes, then well drained, 
and served upon a rather thick round of toasted bread, buttered 
on both sides. Rich melted butter must be sent to table with 
them. This is the Belgian mode of dressing this excellent vege- 
table, which is served in France with the sauce poured over it, 
or it is tossed in a stewpan with a slice of butter and some pep- 
per and salt : a spoonfol or two of veal gravy (and sometimes a 
little lemon-juice) is added when these are perfectly mixed. 

B to 10 minutes. 

' SALSIFY. 

We are surprised that a vegetable so excellent as this should 
be so little cared for in England. Delicately fried in batter, — 
which is a common mode of serving it abroad, — it forms both an 
ele^t and delicious second course dish : it is also good when 
plam - boiled, drained, and served in gravy, or even with 
melted butter. Wash the roots, scrape gently off the dark 
outside skin, and throw them into cold water as they are 
doBe, to prevent their turning black ; cut them into len^hs 
of three or four ruches, and when all are ready put them mto 
plenty of boiling water, with a little salt, a small bit of butter, 
and a couple of spoonsful of white vinegar, or the juice of a 
lemon ; they will be done in from three quarters of an hour to 
an hour. Try them with a fork, and when perfectly tender, 
drain, and serve them with white sauce, rich brown gravy, or 
melted butter. 

I to 1 hour* 

FBEBD SALStFT. (eNTBEMETS.) 

BoH the salsify tender, as directed above, drain, and then 
press it lightly in a soft clqth. Make some French batter (see 
page 129), throw the bits of salsify into it, take them out sepa** 
rately, and fry them a light brown, drain them well from the fat, 
sprinkle a little fine salt over them after they are dished, and 
serve them quickly. At English tables, salsify occasionally 
makes its ^pearance fried with egg and bread-crumbs instead 
of batter. Scorgonera is dressed in predsely the same manner 
as the salsify.

and boH them in plenty of water, with the usual ponoportioQ <^ 
salt, from twenty to thirty minutes. 

20 to 30 minutes. 

- STEWED CELEST. 

Gut five or six fine roots of celery to the length of the inside 
of the dish in which they are to be served; free them from all 
the coarser leaves, and from the ^reen tops, trim the root ends 
neatly, and wash the vegetable in several waters till it is as 
clean as possible ; then, either boil it tender with a little salt, 
land a bit of fresh butter the size of a walnut, in just soffident 
water to cover it quite, drain it well, arrange it on a very hot 
dish, and pour a thick bechamel, or white sauce over it; or 
stew it in broth or common stock, .and serve it with vaj rich, 
thickened, Espignole or brown gravy. It has a h^her navoiir 
when partially stewed in the sauce, after being drained 
thoroughly from the broth. Unless ver^ large and old, it ^ 
be done in from twenty-five to thirty mmutes, but if not quite 
tender, longer time must be allowed for it A cheap and 
expeditious method of preparing this dish is to slice the celery, 
to simmer it until soft in as much good broth as will only just 
cover it, and to add a thickening of Sour and butter, or arrow- 
root, with some salt, pepper, and a small cupful of creani. 

25 to 30 minutes, or more. 

STEWED ONIONS. 

Strip the outer skin from four or five fine Portugal cniiaDSt 
and trim the eods, but without cutting into the v^etable; 
arrange them in a saucepan of sufficient size to contain tiiem all 
m one layer; just cover them with good bee^ or veal gravy, 
and stew them veiygently indeed for a couple of hours: they 
should be tender quite through, but should not be allowed to 
fall to pieces. When large, but not mUd onions are used, they 
should be first boiled for mdf an hour in plenty of water, then 
dramed from it, and put into boiling gravy: strong, well- 
fiavoured broth of veal or beef, is sometimes substituted for 
tills, and with the additi(m of a little catsup, spice, and thick- 
ening answers very well. The savour of this dish is h^htened

by flooring lightly and &ying the onions of a pale hroum hefore 
they are stewed. 

Portugal onions, 4 or 5 (if fried, 15 to 20 minutes) ; broth or 
gravy, 1 to 1 i pint : nearly or quite 2 hours. 

Obs. — ^When the quantity of gravy is considered too much, 
the onions may be only half covered, and turned when the 
under side is tender, but longer time must then be allowed 
for stewing them. 

STEWED CHESTNUTS. 

Strip the outer rind from forty or fifty fine sound Spanish 
ehestnuts, throw them into a large saucepan of hot water, and 
bring it to the point of boiling; when the second skin parts 
from them easily, lift them out, and throw them into plenty of 
cold water; peel, and wipe them dry, then put them into a 
Etewpan or bright saucepan, with as much higmy-flavoured cold 
beef or real gravy as will nearly cover them, and stew them 
very gently from three-quarters of an hour to a full hour : they 
should be quite tender, but unbroken. Add salt, cayenne, or 
thickening, if required,, and serve the chestnuts in their gravy. 
We have found it an improvement to have them floured and 
lightly browned in a little good butter before they are stewed, 
and also to add some thin strips of fresh lemon-rind to the 
gravy. 

Chestnuts, 40 or 50 ; gravy, | pint, or more : | to 1 hour. 

Obs. — ^A. couple of bay-leaves and a slice of lean ham will 
give an improved flavour to the sauce should it not be suffi- 
ciently rich : the ham should be laid under the chestnuts, but 
not served with them. When these are to be browned, or even 
otherwise, they may be freed readily from the second skin by 
abating them with a small bit of butter in. a frying-pan over a 
gentle fire*

Mould for French Pies, or Casferoles of Rice. 
INTSODUGTOSY BEMARKS. 

The CTeatest possible cleanliness and nicety should be observed 
in msudng pastry. The slab or board, paste-rollers, tins, cutters, 
stamps, everything, in fact, used for it, and especially the hands 
(fur these last are not always so scrupulously attended to as 
they ought to be), should be equally free from the slightest 
soil or particle of dust. The more expeditiously the finerkmds 
of crust are made and despatched to the oven, and the less they 
are touched the Jbetter. Much of their excellence depends upon 
the baking also ; they should have a sufficient degree of heat to 
raise them quickly, but not so fierce a one as to colour them too 
much before they are done, and still less to bum them. The 
oven door should remain closed after they are put in, and not 
be removed until the paste is set. Large raised pies require a 
steadily sustained, or, what is technically called a soaldng heat, 
and to ensure this the oven should be made very hot, thai 
cleared, and closely shut from half to a whole hour before it is 
used, to concentrate the heat. It is an advantage in this case to 
have a large lo^ or two of cord- wood burned in it, in addition 
to*the usual firmg. 

In mixing paste, the water should bQ added graduallv, and 
the whole gently drawn together with the fingers, until suffi- 
cient has been added, when it should be Ughtly kneaded until it 
is as smooth as possible. When carelessly made, the sorftce is 
often left covered with small dry crumbs or lumps ; or the water 
is poured in heedlessly in so large a proportion that it becomes 
necessary to add more flour to render it toorkaJUe in any w»v» 
and this ought particularly to be avoided when a certaiii we|^t 
of all the ingredients has been taken.

TO GLAZE OB ICE FASTBT. 

• 

The fine yellow glaze appropriate to meat pies is given with 
beaten yolk of egg, which should be laid on with a paste brush, 
or a snmll bunch of feathers : if a lighter colour be wished for, 
whisk the whole of the egg together, or mix a little milk with 
the yolk. 

The best mode of icing fruit-tarts before they are sent to the 
oven is, to moisten the paste with cold water, to sift sugar 
thickly upon it, and to press it lightly on with the hand ; but 
when a whiter icing is preferred, me pastry must be drawn from 
the oven when nearly baked, and brushed with white of e^g^ 
whisked to a froth ; then well covered with the sifred sugar, and 
sprinkled with a few drops of water before it is put in a^ain : 
this glazing answers also very well, though it takes a uight 
colour, if lued before the pastry is baked. 

FEUUXETAGE, OB EIITE FBEI7CH PUFF PASTE. 

This, when made by a good IVench cook, is the perfection of 
rich light crust, and will rise in the oven from one to six inches 
in height ; but some practice is, without doubt, necessary to 
accomplish this. In siunmer it is a great advantage to have ice 
at hand, and to liarden the butter over it before it is used ; the 
paste dso between the intervals of rolling is improved by being 
laid on an oven-leaf over a vessel containing it. Take an equ^ 
weight of good butter free from the coarse salt which is found 
in some, and which is disadvantageous for this paste, and of fine 
dry, sifted flour ; to each pound of these allow the yolks of a 
couple of eggs, and a small teaspoonfrd of salt. Break a few 
small bits of the butter very lightly into the flour, put the salt 
into the centre, and pour on it ^flicient water to dissolve it (we 
do not quite understand why the doing this should be better 
than mining it with the floiu*, as in other pastes, but such is the 
method always pursued for it) ; add a little more water to the 
eggs, moisten uie flour gradually, and make it into a very 
amooth paste, rather lithe in summer, and never exceedingly 
stiff, though the opposite fault, in an exti-eme, would render the 
cTDst unmanageable. I^ess, in a soft thin cloth, all the mois- 
ture from the remainder of the butter, and form it into a ball, 
but in doing this be careful not to soften it too much. Should 
it be in an unfit state for pastry, from the heat of the w^eather, 
put it into a basin, and set the basin in a ^u of water mixed 
with plenty of salt and saltpetre, and let it remain in a cool 
place for an hour if possible, before it is used. When it is 



336 MODEEN COOEEBT. [jCHAP. XVI. 

ready (and the paste should never he commenced until it he so), 
roll the crust out square,* and of sufficient size to endose the 
butter, flatten this a little upon it in the centre, and then fold 
the crust well over it, and roll it out thin as lishtly as possible, 
after having dredged the board and paste roUer with a little 
flour : this is called giving it one turn. Then fold it ia three, 
give it another turn, and set it aside, where it Avill be very cool, 
JOT a few minutes; give it two more turns in the same way, 
rolling it each time very lightly, but of equal thickness, and to 
the full length that it wiU reach, taking always especial care 
that the butter shall not break through the paste. Let it again 
be set aside to become cold ; and after it has been twice more 
rolled and folded in three, give it a half-turn, by folding it once 
only, and it will be ready for use. 

Equal weight of the finest flour and good butter ; to each 
pound of these, the yolks of two eggs, and a small G^dtspooiifui 
of salt : 6i turns to be given to the paste. 

VERY GOOD UGHT PA8TB. 

Mix with a pound of sifted flom* six ounces of fresh, pure 
lard, and make them into a smooth paste with cold water ; press 
the buttermilk from ten ounces of butter, and form it iuto a 
ball, bv twisting it in a clean cloth. KoU out tlie paste, put 
the ball of butter in the middle, close it like an apple-dumpliug) 
and roll it very lightly imtil it is less than an inch tliick; fold the 
ends into the middle, dust a little flour over the board and 
paste-roller, and roll the paste thin a second time, then set it 
aside for three or ^our minutes in a very cool place ; give it two 
more turns, and after it has again been left for a few miimtes, roll 
it out twice more, folding it, each time in three. This ought to 
render it fit for use. The sooner this paste is sent to the oven 
after it is made, the lighter it will be : ii* allowed to remain loug 
before it is baked, it -mil be tough and heavy.

CBEAM CRUST. 

(Very good.) 

Stir a little fine salt into a pound of dry flour, and mix gra^ 
dually >vith it sufficient very thick, s\veet cream to form a smooth 
paste; it will be found sufficiently good for common family 
dinners, without the addition of butter ; but to make an excellent 
crust, roll in four ounces in the usual way, after having given 
the paste a couple of turns. Handle it as lightly as possible in 
making it, and send it to the oven as soon as it is ready ; it may 
be used for fruit tarts, cannelons, puffs, and other varieties of 
small pastry, or for good meat pies. Six ounces of butter to the 
pound of flour will give a very rich crust.

slioe it very thin into the flour, add sufficient salt to giye fiavoui' 
to the paste, and make the whole up smooth and firm with cold 
water; lay it on a dean dresser, and heat it forcibly with a 
rolling-pin until the flead is blended perfectly with the flour. 
It may then be made into cakes with a paste-cutter, or used for 
pies, round the edges of which a knife should be passed, as the 
crust rises better when cut than if merely rolled to the proper 
size. With the addition of a small quantity of butter, which 
may either be broken into the flour before the flead is mixed 
with it, or rolled into the paste after it is beaten, it will be found 
equal to fine puif cnist, with the advantage of being more easv

COMMON STTBT-CBUST FOB FIES. 

In many families this is preferred both for pies and tarts, to 
crust made with butter, as being much more wholesome ; but it 
should never be served unless especially ordered, as it is to some 
persons peculiarly distasteful. Chop tne suet extremely small, 
and add from six to eight ounces of it to a pound of floor, with 
a few grains of salt ; mix these with cold water into a firm paste, 
and work it very smooth. Some cooks beat it with a paste- 
roller, imtil the suet is perfectly blended with the flour; but the 
crust is lighter without this. In exceedingly sultry weather the 
suet, not being firm enough to chop, may be sliced as thin as 
possible, and well beaten into the paste after it is worked up.

butter is, in making pufl'^'paste, and in this form will be fouad 
a most excellent substitute for it, for hot pies or tarts. It is not 
quite so good for those which are to be served cold. Eight

BBIOGHS PASTE. 

The brioche is a rich, light kind of unsweetened bun, or cake, 
veiy commonly sold, and served to all classes of people in 
France, where it is made in great perfection by good cooks and 
pastrycooks. It is fashionable now at English tables, though in 
a difimnt form, serving principally as a crust to enclose rissoles^ 
or to make cannelons aind fritters. We have seen it recom- 
mended for a vol-aurvent, for which we should sav it does not 
answer by any means so well as the fine pufl-paste called 
feuiUetage. The large proportion of butter and egss which it 
contains render it to many persons highly indigestible ; and we 
mention this to warn invalids against it, as we have known it to 
cause great suflfering to persons out of health. To make it, take 
a couple of ponnds* of fine dry flour, sifted as for cakes, and 
separate eight ounces of this from the remainder to make the 
leaven. P^t it into a small pan, and mix it lightly into a lithe 
paste, with haJf an ounce of yeast, and a spoonful or two of 
^arm water ; make two or three slight incisions across the top, 
throw a doth over the pan, and plaice it near the fire for about 
twenty minutes, to rise. In the mterval make a hollow space 
in the centre of the remainder of the flour, and put into it naif 
an ounce of salt, as much fine sifted sugar, and half a gill of 
creaoij or a dessertspoonful of water ; add a pound of butter, 
as free &om moisture as it can be, and quite so from large 

* It should be remarked, that the directions for brioche-making arepriucipalljr 
derifed from the French, and that the pound in their country weighg two ounces 
more than with us : this ditference will account for the difficulty of working in 
the number of eggs which they generally specify* and which render the paste too

(^Ji excetiaUfaanbf dislu) 

A tin mould of the construction shown in the plate, with a 
perforated moTcable top, and a small Talre to allow the escape 
of the steam, must be had for this pasty, which is an exceUeot 
family dish, and which may be Taried in numberless wap> 
Arrange at the bottom of the mould from two to three pounds 
of mutton cutlets, freed, aocordin|^ to the taste, from all, or ftm 
the greater portion of the fat, then washed, lightly dredged on 
both sides with floilr, and seasoned with salt and pepper, or 
cayenne. Pour to them sufficient broth or water to nuie the 
gravy, and add to it at pleasure, a tablespoonful of mushroom 
catsup or of Harvey's sauce. Have ready boiled, and vtry 
smoothly mashed, with about an ounce of butter, and a spoon-

fill or two of milk or cream to each pound, as many good pota- 
toes as will form a crust to the pasty of quite three inches 





thick ; put the cover on the mould and arrange these equally 
upon it, leaving them a little rough on the surface. Bake the 
fasty in a moderate oven from three quarters of an hour to an 
hour and a quarter, according to its size and its contents. Pin 
a folded napsin neatly round the mould, before it is served, and 
have ready a hot dish to receive the cover, which must not be 
lifted off until after the pasty is on the table. 

Chicken, or veal and oysters; delicate pork chops with a 
seasoning of sage and a little parboiled onion, or an eschalot or 
twofinefymin^; partridges or rabbits neatly carved, mixed 
with small mushrooms, and moistened with a little good stock, 
will all give excellent varieties of this dish, which may be made 
likewise with highly seasoned slices of salmon freed from the 
skin, sprinkled with fine herbs or intermixed with shrimps; 
darified butter, rich veal stock, or good white wine, may be 
poured to them to form the gravy. To thicken this, a little 
flour should be dredged upon the fish before it is laid into the 
mould. Other kinds, such as cod, mullet, mackerel in fillets, 
salt fish (previously kept at the point of boiling until three parts 
done, then pulled into flakes, and put into the mould with nard 
^gs sliced, a little cream, flour, butter, cayenne, and anchovy- 
essence, and baked with mashed parsneps on the top), will all 
answer well for this pasty. Veal, when used for it, should be 
well beaten first : sweetbreads, sliced, may be laid in with it. 

For a pasty of moderate size, two pounds, or two and a half of 
meat, and from three to four of potatoes will be sufi^cient : a 
quarter-pint of milk or cream, two small teaspoonsful of saltj 
aud from one to two ounces of butter must be mixed up with 
these last. * 

• A larger proportion of cream and butter well dried into the potatoes over a 

Stte fixs, after tbey an maihed, will render the crust of the pasty richer and 
r.

CASSEBOLE OF SICE. 



Proceed exactly as for Gabrielle's pudding (see Cba]^ter 
XVIIL), but substitute good veal >brotb or stock for tlie milk, 
and add a couple of ounces more of butter. Fill the casserole 
when it is emptied, with a rich mince or fricassee, or with stewed 
oysters in a b6chamel sauce. French cooks make a \ay 
troublesome and elaborate a£fair of this dish, putting to the rice 
to make it ^' meUow,^^ a great deal of pot-top fat, slices of fat 
ham, &c., which must afterwards be well dramed off, or picked 
out fh>m it; but the dish, made as we have directed, wiU be 
found excellent eating, and of very elegant appearance, if it be 
moulded in a tasteful shape. It must have a quick oven to 
colour, without too much drying it. For a large casserole, a 
pound of rice and a quart of grayy will be required : a bit of 
oread is sometimes used in fillmg the mould, cut to the shape, 
and occupying nearly half the inside, but always so as to leave 
a thick and compact crust in every part Part of the rice 
which is scooped m>m the inside is sometimes mixed with the 
mince, or other preparation, vnth which the casserole is filled. 

A GOOD COMMON ENGLISH GAME PIE. 

Baise the flesh enture from the upper side of the best end of 
a well-kept neck of venison, trim it to the length of the dish in 
which the pie is to be served, and rub it vnth a mixture of salt; 
cayenne, pounded mace, and nutmeg. Out down into joints a 
fine young hare which has hung £rom eight to fourteen days, 
' bone the back and thighs, and fifi them vnth forcemeat No. 1, 
(page 143), but put into it a double portion of butter, and a 
small quantitv'of minced eschalots, should their flavour be liked, 
and the raw liver of the hare, chopped small. Line the dish 
with a rich short crust (see page 337), lay the venison in the 
centre, and the hare closely round and on it ; fill the vacant 
spaces vrith more forcemeat, add a few spoonsM of well-jellied 
gravy, fasten on the cover securely, ornament it or not, at 
pleasure, and bake the pie two hours in a well heated oven* 
The remnants and bones of the hare and venison may he 
stewed down into a smsdl quantity of excellent soup, or ynth a 
less proportion of v^ter into an admirable gravy, part of which, 
after having been cleared from fat^ may be poured into the pie* 
The jelly, added to its contents at first, can be made, when no 
such stock is at hand, of a couple of pounds of shin of bee( 
boiled dovm in a quart of vyater, which must be reduced quite 
half, and seasoned only -with, a good slice of lean ham, a fe^ 
peppsrcoms, seven or eight doves, a blade x>f mace, and a Kttle

salt. One pound and a half of flour will be snfficient for the 
crust; this, when it is so prefejrred, may be laid round the sides 
only of the dish, instead of entirely over it. The prime joints 
of a second hare may be substituted for the yenison when it can 
be more conyenientfy procured. 

Baked 2 hours. 

Obit. — These same ingredients will make an excellent raised 
pie, if the yenison be divided and intermixed with the hare; the 
whole should be highly seasoned, and all the cavities fiUed 
with the forcemeat No. 18 (page 151),* or with the truffled 
sausage-meat of page 252. The top, before the paste is laid 
over, should be covered with slices of fat bacon, or with plenty 
of butter, to prevent the surface of the meat from becoming 
hard. No liquid is to be put into the pie until after it is baked, 
if at all. It will require from half to a full hour more of the 
oven than if baked in a dish. 

XODEBN CHICKSN FIB. 

Skin, and cut down into joints a couple of fowls, take out aU 
the hemes, and season the flesh highly with salt, cayenne, 
pounded mace, and nutmeg ; line a dish with a thin paste, and 
spread over it a layer of the finest sausage*meat, which has 
previously been moistened with a spoonful or two of cold water; 
over this place closely together some of the boned chicken 
ioints, then more sausage-meat., and continue thus with alternate 
layers of each, until the dish is full ; roll out, and &8ten securely 
at the edges, a cover half an inch thick, trim off the supei^uous 
paste, m&e an incision in the top, lay some paste leaves round 
it, g]a% the whole with yolk of egg, and bake the pie from an 
hour and a half to two hours in a well heated oven. Lay a 
sheet or two of writine-]mper oyer the crust, should it brown 
too quicldy. Minced herbs can be mixed with the sausage-meiit 
at pieasnre, and a small quantity of eschalot also, where the 
favour is much liked : it snould be well moistened with water, 
or the whole will be unpalatably dry. The pie may be served 
hot or cold, but we would rather recommend the latter. 

A couple of very young. tender rabbits will answer exceed- 
ingly well for it instead of fowls, and a border, or half paste in the 
dish will generally be preferred to an entire lining of the crust, 
which is now but rarely served, imless for pastry, which is to 
be taken out of the dish in which it is baked before it is sent to 
table.

A COXMOH CHICKEN FIE. 

Prepare the fiiwls as for bofling, cut them dofwn into jcnnffl, 
and season them with^t, white pepper, and nutmeg, or poanded 
mace ; arrange them neatly in a dish bordered with paste, lay 
amongst them three or four fresh eggs, boiled hard, and cat in 
halres, poor in some cold water, put on a thick cover, pare the 
edge, and ornament it, make a hole in the centre, lay a roll of 
paste, or a few leaves round it, and bake the pie in a moderate 
oven from an hoar to an hour and a hidf The back and 
neck bones may be boiled down with a bit or two of leim ham, 
to make a little additional gravy^ which can be poured into the 
pie after it is baked. 

PIGEON FIE. 

Border a large dish with fine puff-paste, and cover the bottom 
with a veal cutlet, or tender rump stedc, free from &t and 
bone, and seasoned with sal^ cayenne, and nutmeg, or pounded 
mace ; prepare with ^reat nicety as many freshly-killed yonng 
pigeons as the dish will contain in one layer ; put into each t 
slice or ball of butter, seasoned with a little cayenne and mace; 
lay them into the dish with the breasts downwards, and be- 
tween and over them put the yolks of half a dozen or more of 
hard-boiled e^gs ; stick plentjr of butter on ^em, season the 
whole well with salt and roice, pour in some cold water or 
veal broth for the ^vy, roll out me cover three quarters of an 
inch thick, secure it well found the edge, ornament it highly) 
and bake it for an hour or more in a well-heated oven. It is & 
great improvement to fill the birds with small mushroom' 
buttons, prepared as for partridges (see Chapter XHX): their 
livers also may be put into them. 

BEEF-STEAK PIE. 

From a couple to three pounds of rump-steak will be suffi- 
cient for a good family pie. It should be well kept though 
perfectly sweet, for in no form can tainted meat be more offen- 
sive than when it is enclosed in paste. Trim off the coarse 
skin, and part of the fat, should there be much of it (many 
eaters dislike it altogether in pies, and when this is the case 
every morsel should be carefully cut awayV If the heef 
should not appear very tender, it may be gently beaten with a 
paste-roller until the fibre is broken, then divided into slices half 
as large as the hand, and laid into a dish bordered with paste. 
It should be seasoned with salt and pepper, or cayenne, and

soffident i^ater poured in to make the gravy, and keep the 
meat moist. Lay on the cover, and be careful always to brush 
the edge in every part with egg or cold water, then join it 
securely to the paste which is round the rim, trim both off 
close to the dish, pass the point of the knife through the middle 
of the cover, lay some slight roll or ornament of paste round 
it, and decorate the border of the pie in any of the usual 
modes, which are too common to require description. Send the 
pie to a well-heated, but not fierce oven for about an hour and 
twenty minutes. To make a richer beef-steak pie put bearded 
oysters in alternate layers with the meat, add their strained 
liquor to a little good gravy, in which the beards may be sim- 
mered for a few minutes, to give it fiirther flavour, and make a 
%ht puff paste for the crust. Some eaters like it seasoned 
with a small portion of minced onion or eschalot when the 
oysters are omitted. Mushrooms improve all meat-pies.

MUTTON PDS, 

(^Common.') 

A pound and a quarter of flour will make sufficient paste for 
a moderate-sized pie, and two pounds of mutton freed from the 
greater portion of the fat will fill it. Butter a dish, and line it 
with about half the paste rolled thin ; lay in the mutton evenly, 
and sprinkle over it three quarters of an ounce of salt, and 
from half to a whole teaspoouM of pepper according to the 
taste; pour in cold water to within an inch of the brim. 
KoU the (^ver, which should be quite half an inch thick, to 
the size of the dish \ wet the edges of the paste with cold water 
or white of egg, be careful to close them securely, cut them off 
close to the rim of the dish, stick the point of the knife through 
the centre, and bake the pie an hour and a quarter in a well-* 
heated oven.

fat entirely, and raise the flesh clear from the bones without 
dividing it, then slice it into cutlets of equal thickness, season 
them well with salt and pepper, or cayenn?, and strew between 
the layers some finely-minced herbs mixed with two or three

•nd cat it to the shape and size of the inside of the dish in which 
it 18 to be served, or stamp it oat with a fluted tin of proper 
dimensions; then mark the cover evenly about an inch from 
the edge all rcmnd, and ornament it and the border abo, with a 
knife, as tuacy may direct ; brush yolk of egg quickly over 
them, and put the vol-au-voit immediately into a brisk oven, 
that it may rise weU, and be finely coloured, but do not allow 
it to be scorched. In from twenty to thirty minutes, should it 
appear baked through, as well as sufficiently browned, draw it 
out, and with the point of a knife detach the cover carefully 
irhere it has been marked, and scoop out all the soft unbaked 
crumb from the inside of the vol-au-vent; then turn it gently 
on to a sheet of dean paper, to drain the butter frt)m it. At 
the instant of serving, fill it with a rich firicassee of lobster, or d 
sweetbreads, or with iurbot a la erhne, or with* the white part 
of cold roast veal cut in thin collops not larger than a shilmig, 
and heated in good white sauce with oysters (see minced veu 
and oysters, pa^ 219), or with any other of the prepanttions 
which we shall mdicate in their proper places, and send it im- 
mediately to table. The vol-au-vent, as the reader will perceivCi 
18 but the case, or crust, in which various kinds of delicate 
ragouts are served in an elegant form. As these are most fre- 
onently composed of fish, or of meats which have been already 
dressed, it is an economical as well as an excellent mode of 
employing such remains. The sauces in which they are heated 
must be quite thick, for they would otherwise soften, or even 
run through the crust This, we ought to observe, should be 
examined before it is filled, and should any part appear too thin, 
a portion of the crumb which has been taken out should be 
fastened to it with some beaten egg, and the whole of the 
inside brushed lightly with more egg, in order to make tbe 
loose parts of the vol-au-vent stick well tosether. This method 
is recommended by an admirable and highly experienced cook, 
but it need only be resorted to when the crust is not solid 
enough to hold the contents securely. 

For moderate-sized vol-au-vent, flour, J lb.; butter, \ lb.; 
salt, small saltspoonful ; yolk, 1 egg; little water. Lai^ 
vol-au-vent, | lb. flour; other ingredients in proportion: baked 
20 to 30 minutes. 

Obs» — When the vol-au-vent is- cut out with the fluted cutter, 
a second, some sizes smaller, after being just dipped into bot 
water, should be pressed nearly hdf through the paste, to mark 
the cover. The border ought to be from three quarters of an 
inch to an inch and a half wide.

A VOL-AU-VENT OF FRUIT. (SNTBEMETS.) 

After the crust has been made and baked as above, fill it at 
the moment of serving with peaches, apricots, mogul, or any 
other richly flavoured plums, which have been stew^ tender in 
syrup ; lift them from this, and keep them hot while it is boiled 
rapidly almost to jelly ; then arrange the fruit in the vol-au- 
vent, and pour the syrup over it. For the manner of preparing 
it, see compotes of fruit. Chapter XX ; but increase the pro- 
portion of sugar nearly half, that the iuice may be reduced 
quickly to the proper consistency for tne vol-au-vent. Skin 
and divide the apricots, and quarter the peaches, unless they 
should be very small. 

VOL-AU-VENT A LA CB^ME. (eNTBEMETS.) 

After having raised the cover and emptied the vol-au-vent, 
lay it on a sheet of paper, and let it become cold. Fill it just 
h^ore it is sent to table with fruit, either boiled down to a rich 
marmalade, or stewed as for the preceding vol-au-vent, and 
heap well flavoured, but not too highly sweetened, whipped 
cream over it. The edge of the crust may be glazed by sifting 
sugar over it, when it is drawn from the oven, and holding a 
salamander or red hot shovel above it ; or it may be left un- 
glazed, and ornamented with bright coloured fruit jelly^ 

OTSTEB PATTIES.* (enTB^E.) 

Line some small patty-pans with fine puft-paste, rolled thin 
and to preserve their form when baked, put a bit of bread into 
each ; lay on the covers, pinch and trim the edges, and send the 
patties to a brisk oven. Plump and beard from two to three 
dozens of small oysters; mix very smoothly a teaspoonful of 
flour with an ounce of butter, put them into a dean saucepan, 
shake them round over a gentle fire, and let them sinuner for 
two or three minutes ; throw in a little salt, pounded mace, and 
cayenne, then add, by slow degrees, two or three spoonsftil of 
rich cream, give these a boil, and pour in the strained liquor of 
the masters ; next, lay in the fish, and keep at the point of boil- 
ing &r a couple of minutes. Raise the covers from the patties, 
take out the bread, fill them with the oysters and their sauce, 
and replace the covers. We have found it an improvement ta 

* These patties should be made gmall, with a thin crust, and be mell-^lled with 
the ojgtera and their sauce. The substitution of fried crumbs for the covers will 
▼ary them very agreeably. For lobster patties, prepare the fish at for a vol-au^ 
9€nt, bat cut it smaller.

stew the beards of the fish with a strip or two of lemon-peel, in

into a dish with the butter, and its own gravy, and let it become 
cold. Mince it with a sharp knife ; heat it, without allowing it 
to boil, iu a little good white sauce (which may be made of some 
of the bones of Sie fowl), and fill ready-bs^ed patty-cmsts, or 
small vol-au-vents with it, just before they are sent to table; or 
stew the flesh only just sufficiently to render it firm, mix it aher 
it is minced and seasoned with a spoonful or two of strong 
gravy, fill the patties, and bake them from fifteen to e^teen 
minutes. It is a great improvement to stew and mince a few 
mushrooms with the chicken. 

The breasts of cold turkeys, fowls, partridges, or pheasants, 
or the white part of cold veal, minced, heat^ in a blchamd 
sauce, will serve at once for patties : they may also be made of 
cold game, heated in an Espagnole^ or in a goda brown gravy. 

PATTIES k UL POHTIFE. (eNTH^B.) 

(A fast dayy or Maigre dish,') 

Mince, but not very small, the yolks of six fresh hard boOed 
eggs ; mince also and mix with them a couple of fine truffles,* 
a large saltspoonfiil of salt, half the quantity of mace and nut-

OA*.— A spoonful or two of jellied stock or gravy, or of good 
white sauce, converts these into admirable patties: the same 
ingredients make also very superior i*olls or cannelons. For 
patties k la Cardinale, small mushroom-buttons stewed as for 
partridges, Chapter XIII., before the^ are minced, must be sub- 
stituted for truffles ; and the butter m which they are simmered 
should be added with them to the eggs. 

EXCELLENT MEAT BOLLS. 

Found, as for potting Tsee page 297), and with the same pro- 
portion of butter and or seasonings, some half- roasted veal, 
chicken, or turkey. Make some forcemeat by the receipt Ko. 
1, Chapter VI., and form it into small roUs, not larger than a 
finger; wrap twice or thrice as much of the pounded meat 
equally round each of these, first moistening it with a teaspoonful 
of water ; fold theni in good puff-pastie, and bake them from 
fifteen, to twenty minutes, or until the crust is perfectly 
done. A small quantity of the lean of a boiled ham may be 
finely ininced and pounded with the veal, and very small mush- 
rooms, prepared as for a partridge (page 280), may be substituted 
for the forcemeat. 

PATTIES, TARTLETS, OE SMALL VOL8-AU-VBNT8. 

These are quickly and easily made with two round paste-ciit- 
terSfOf which one should be little more than half the size of the 
other : to give the pastry a better appearance, they should be 
fluted. Roll out some of the lightest puff-paste to a half-inch 
of thickness, and with the larger of the tins cut the number of 
patties required ; then dip the edge of the small shape into hot 
water, and press it about naif through them. Bake them in a 
moderately quick oven from ten to twelve minutes, and when 
they are done, with the point of a sharp knife, take out the small 
rounds of crust from the tops, and scoop aU the crumb from the 
insides of the patties, which may then be filled with shrimps, 
03rsters, lobster, chicken, pheasant, or any other of the ordinary 
varieties of patty meat, prepared with white sauce. Fried crumro 
may be laid over them instead of the covers, or these last can 
be replaced. . 

For sweet dishes, glaze the pastry, and fill it with rich whip- 
ped cream, preserve, or boiled custard ; if with the last of these 
put it back mto a very gentle oven until the custards are set. 

ANOTHER RECEIPT FOR TARTLETS. 

For a dozen tartlets, cut twenty-four rounds of paste of the 



352 MODERN COOEEST. £CHAP. XYI« 

Dsoal size, and form twelve of them into rings by presang the 
small cutter quite through them ; moisten these with cold water,- 
or white of ^g, and lay them on the remainder of the rounds 
of paste, so as to form the rims of the tartlets. Bake them from 
ten to twelve minutes, fill them with preserve while they are 
still warm, and place over it a small ornament of paste cut from 
the remnants, and baked gently of a light colour. Serve the 
tartlets cold, or if wanted hot for table put them back into the 
oven for one minute after they are filled. 

A SEFTON, OB V£AIi CUSTABD. 

Pour boiling, a pint of rich, clear, pale veal gravy on six fresh 
eggs, which have been well beaten and strained : sprinkle in 
directly the grated rind of a fine lemon, a little cayenne, some 
salt if needed, and a quarter-teaspoouM of mace. Put a paste 
border round a dish, pour in, first two ounces of clarified butter, 
and then the other ingredients ; bake the Sefton in a very slow 
oven from twenty-five to thirty minutes, or until it is quite firm 
in the middle, and send it to table with a little good gravy. 
Very highly flavoured game stock, in which a few mushrooms 
Lave been stewed, may be used for this dish with great advan- 
tage in lieu of veal gravy ; and a sauce made of the smallest 
mushroom buttons, may be served with it in either case. The 
mixture can be baked in a whole paste, if preferred so, or in ^ 
buttered cups ; then turned out and covered with the sauce be- 
fore it is sent to table. 

Rich veal or game stock, 1 pint ; fresh eggs, 6; rind, 1 lemon; 
little salt and cayenne; pounded mace, i teaspoonful ; butter, 2 
ozs. ; baked, 25 to 30 mmutes, slow oven. 

APPIiE CAKE, OB GEBMAN TABT. 

Work together with the fingers, ten ounces of butter and a 
pound of flour, until they resemble fine cnmibs of bread ; throw 
in a small pinch of salt, and make them into a firm smooth 
paste with the yolks of two eggs and a spoonful or two of water. 
Butter thickly, a plain tin cake, or pie mould (those which open 
at the sides, see plate, page 334, are best adapted for the purpose); 
roll out the paste thin, place the mould upon it, trim a bit to its 
exact size, cover the bottom of the mould with this, then cut a 
band the height of the sides, and press it smoothly round them, 
joining the edge, which must be moistened vfith egg or water, to 
the bottom crust ; and fasten upon them, to prevent their sepa- 
ration, a narrow and thin band of paste, also moistened. Next, 
fill the mould nearly from the brim with the following manwr 



CHAP. XYI.]] FINE PASTRY. 353 

lade, which must he quite cold when it is put in. Boil together, 

over a geatle fire at first, hut more quickly afterwards, three 

pounds of good apples with fourteen ounces of pounded sugar, 

or of the finest Lishon, the strained juice of a large lemon, three 

ounces of the hest hutter, and a teaspoonfiil of pounded cinnamon, 

or the Ughtly grated rind of a couple of lemons: when the whole 

B perfecUy smooth and dry, turn it into a pan to cool, and let it 

be quite cold hefore it is put into the paste. In early autumn, 

a larger proportion of sugar may he required, but this can be 

regulated by the taste. When the mould is filled, roll out the 

oover, lay it carefully over the marmalade that it may not touch 

it ; and when the cake is securely closed, trim off the superfluous 

paste, add a little pounded siu;ar to the parings, spread them out 

Teiy thin, and cut them into leayes to ornament the top of the 

cake, round which they may be placed as a sort of wreath.* 

Bake it for an hour in a moderately brisk oven ; take it from 

the mould, and should the sides not be sufficiently coloured put 

it back for a few minutes into the oyen upon a baking tin. Lay 

a paper oyer the top, when it is of a fine light brown, to preyent 

its being too deeply coloured. This cake would be seryed hot. 

Paste: flour, 1 lb.; butter, 10 ozs. ; yolks of eggs, 2; little 

water. Marmalade: apples, 3 lbs.; sugar, 14 ozs. (more if 

needed) ; juice of lemon, 1 ; rinds of lemons, 2 : butter, 3 ozs. : 

baked, 1 hour. 

TOUBTE HSBINOU^ OB TABT WITH BOTAL ICINO.f 

Lay a band of fine paste round the rim of a tart-dish, fill it 
with any kind of firmt mixed with a moderate proportion of 
sugar, roll out the coyer yery eyenly, moisten the e&es of the 
paste, press them together carefully, and trim them on close to 
the ^sn ; spread equally oyer the top^ to within rather more 
than an inch of the edge all round, the whites of three fresh 
eggs beaten to a quite solid froth, and mixed quickly at the mo- 
ment of iismff them, with three tablespoonsful of dry sifted 
sugar. Put the tart into a moderately brisk oyen, and when the 
crust has risen well, and the idng is set, either lay a sheet of 
writing-paper lightly oyer it, or draw it to a part of the oyen

f The limits to which we are obliged to conflne this Tolume, compel us to omit 
many receipts which we would gladly insert; we have, theref ire, rejected those 
which may be found in almost every English cooltery book, for such as are, we 
■pprehend, less known to the reader : this will account for the smaU namber of 
receipts for fries and fruit tarts to be found in the present chapter.

where it will not take too much colour. This is now a fashkm- 
able mode of icing tarts, and greatly improves their appearance. 
Bakehalf an hour. < 



A GOOD APPLE TABT. 

A pound and a quarter of apples, weighed after they are 
pared ahd cored, will be sufficient for a small tart, and four 
ounces more for one of moderate size. Lay a border of English 
puff-paste, or of cream-crust round the dish, just dip the apples 
mto water, arrange them very compactly in it, higher in the 
centre than at the sides, and strew amongst them from three to 
four ounces of pounded sugar, or more should they be very 
acid : the grated rind, and the strained juice of half a lemon will 
much improve their flavour. Lay on the cover rolled thin, and 
ice it or not at pleasure. Send the tart to a moderately brisk 
oven for about naif an hour. This may be converted into the 
old-fashioned creamed ajpple tart, by cutting out the cover while 
it is still quite hot, leavmg only about an inch- wide border of 
paste round the edge, and pouring over the apples when thev 
have become cold, &om half to three quarters of a pint of ricn 
boiled custard. The cover divided into triangular sippets, was 
formerly stuck round the inside of the tart, but ornamen- 
tal leaves of pale puff-paste have a better effect. Well- 
drained whipped cream may be substituted for the custard, and 
piled high, and lightly over the fruit. 

BARBEBRT TAST. 

Barberries, with half their weight of fine brown sugar, when 
they are thoroughly ripe, and with two ounces more when they 
are not quite so, make an admirable tart. For one of moderate 
size, put into a dish bordered with paste, three quarters of 
a pound of barberries stripped from their stalks, and six ounces 
of sugar in alternate layers ; pour over them three tablespoons- 
ful of water, put on the cover, and bake the tart for half an 
hour. Another way of making it is, to line a shallow tin pan 
with very thin crust, to mix the fruit and sugar well tojzeuier 
with a spoon, before they are laid in, and to put bars of paste 
across instead of a cover ; or it may be baked without either.* 

* The Prench make their fruit-tarts generally thus, in large shallow pans. 
Plums, split and stoned (or if of small kinds, left entire), cherries and currants 
fteed from the stalks, and various other fruits, all rolled in plenty of sugar, are 
baked in the uncovered crust'; or this is baked by itself, and then filled afterwards 
wiih iruit previously, stewed tender.

Make some nouilles (see page 5) with the yolks of four fresh

itlj into a pint and a half of boiling cream (new muk will 
answer €[uite as well, or a portion of each may be used), ia 
whicti SIX ounces of fresh butter have been dissolved. When 
these have boiled quickly for a minute or two, during which 
time they must be stirred to prevent their gathering ihto lumps, 
add a small pinch of salt, and six ounces of sugar, on which tne 
rinds of two lemons have been rasped ; place me saucepan over 
i. clear and very gentle fire, and when the mixture has sim- 
mered from thirty to forty minutes take it off, stir briskly in 
the yolks of six eggs, and pour it out upon a delicately clean 
baking-tin which has been slightly rubb^ in every part with 
batter ; level the nouilles with a knife to something less than 
a quarter-inch of thickness, and let them be very evemv spread ; 
put them into a moderate oven, and bake them of a nne equal 
brown : should any air-bladders appear, pierce them with the 
point of a knife. On taking the paste from the oven, divide it 
into two equal parts ; turn one of these, the under-side upper- 
most, on to a clean tin or a large dish, and spread quickly over 
it a jar of fine apricot-jam, place the other half upon it, the 
brown side outwards, and leave the paste to become cold; then 
stamp it out with a round or diamond-shaped cutter, and ar- 
range the genoises tastily in a dish. This pastry will be found 
delicious the day it is baked, but its excellence is destroyed by 
keeping. Peach, green-gage, or magnum bonum jam, will serve 
for it quite as well as apricot. We strongly recommend to our 
readers this preparation, baked in pat^-pans, and served hot ; 
or the whole quantity made into a pudoii^. From the smaller 
ones a little may be taken out with a teaspoon, and replaced 
with some preserve just before they are sent to table ; or they 
may thus be eaten cold.

sugar, 6 ozs. ; rasped rinds of lemons, 2 ; grain of salt : 30 to

ALMOND PASTE. 

For a single dish of pastry, blanch seven ounces of fine Jor- 
dan almonds and one of bitter ;* throw them into cold water as 
they are done, and let them remain in it for an hour or two;

then wipe, and pound them to the finest paste, moistening them 
occasioimlly with a few drops of cold water, to prevent their 
oiling; n^<, add to, and mix thoroughly with them, seven 
onnces of highly-re&ied, dried, and suied sugar ; put them 
into a small presenriog-pan, or enamelled stewpan, and stir 
them over a dear and very gentle fire until they are so diy as 
not to adhere to the finger when touched ; turn the paste im- 
mediately into an earthen pan or jar, and when cold it will be 
ready for use. 

Jordan almonds, 7 ozs. ; hitter almonds, 1 oz. ; cold water, 1 
tahlespoonful ; sqgar, 7 ozs. 

Obs, — ^The pan in which the paste is dried, should hy no 
means be placed upon the fire, but high above it on a bar or 
trevet : should it be allowed by accident to burden too much, 
it must be sprinkled plentifidly with water, broken up quite 
small, and worked, as it warms, with a strong wooden spoon to 
a smooth paste again. We have found this method perfectly 
successful ; but, if time will permit, it should be moistened some 
hours before it is again set over the fire. 

TABTLBTS OF AiafOIlB PASTE. 

Butter slightly the smallest-sized patty-pans, and line them 
with the almond-paste rolled as thin as possible ; cut it with a 
sharp knife dose to their edges, and bake or rather dry the 
tartlets slowly at the mouth of a very cool oven. If at all 
coloured, they should be only of the palest brown; but ihesf 
will become perfectly crisp without losing their whiteness if left 
for some hours in a very gently-heated stove or oven. Thev 
should be taken from the pans when two thirds done, and laid, 
reversed, upon a sheet of paper placed on a dish or board, 
before they are put back •mto the oven. At the instant d 
serving, fill them with bright-coloured whipped cream, or with 
peach or apricot jam ; if the preserve be used, lay ova it a 
small star or other ornament cut from the same paste, and dried 
with the tartlets. Sifted sugar, instead of flour, must he 
dredged upon the board and roller in usinff almond paste. 
LcAves and flowers formed of it, and dried gradually until per- 
fectly crisp, vnll keep for a long time in a tin box or canister, 
and they form elegant decorations for pastnr. When a fluted 
cutter the size of the pattypans is at nand, it will be an im- 
provement* to cut out the paste mth it, and then to presa it 
lightly into them, as it is rather apt to break when pared off 
with a knife. To colour it, prepared cochineal, or spiaach- 
green, mnst be added to it in the mortar.

To one pound of an nnsalted ox-tongrae, boiled tender and 

eat free from the rind, add two pounds of fine stoned raisins, 

two of beef kidney-suet, two pounds and a half of currants well 

cleaned and dried, two of good apples, two and a half of fine 

Lisbon sugar, from half to a nmole pound of candied peel 

according to the taste, the grated rinds of two kur^ lenuHis, and 

two more boiled quite tender, and chopped up enturely, with the 

exception of the pips, two small nutmegs, luuf an ounce of salt, 

& wg^ teaspoonnil of pounded mace, rather more of singer in 

powder, half a pint of brandy, and as much good sherry or 

Madeira. Afince these ingredients separately, and mix the 

others all well before the brandy and the wine are added ; press 

the whole into a jar or jars, and keep it doeely covered. It 

shoold be stored for a few days before it is used, and will remain 

good for many weeks. Some persons like a slight flayouring of 

cloves in admtion to the other spices; others add the juice of 

two or three lemons, and a larger quantity of brandy. The 

hmde of a tender and well-roasted sirloin of beef will answer 

quite as well as the tongue. 

Of a fresh-bofled ox-tongue, or inside of roasted sirloin, 1 lb. ; 
Bttmed raisins and minced apples, each 2 lbs. ; currants and fine 
Lisbon sugar, each 2) lbs. ; candied orange, lemon or citron

to one and a quarter. 

SUPEBIATiyB MINCBUBAT. 

Take four large lemons, with their weight of golden pippins 
P^ed and cored, of jar-raisins, currants, candied citron and 
orange-rind, and the finest suet, and a fourth part more of

and eaten by all classes of people during Lent. Boil for fifteen 
minutes thiee ounces of ground rice* in a pint and a half of new 
milk, and when taken, mm the &ce stir into it three ounces of 
butter and four of sugar ; add to these six well-beaten eggs, a 
grain or two of salt, and a flavouring of nutmeg or lemon-rind 
at pleasure. When the mixture is nearly cold, line some large . 
psttypans or some saucers with thin puff paste, fill them with it 
three parts fiill, strew the tops thickly witn currants which have 
heen cleaned and dried, and bake the pudding-pies firom fifteen

BOILED PUDDINGS. 




Intoldibr ChrWoui piiidlD(. 



Att, the ingredients for puddings sboi^d be Aresh and of ffood 
quality. It ia a false economy to use for tliem such aa hive 
been too long stored, aa the slightest degree of miudnen or 
taint in any one of tlie articles of which they are composed 
will spoil all that are combined with it. Eggs should Jmaift 
be broken separately into a cap before they are thrown togeliier 
in the same basin, aa a single yer^ bad one will occasion the 
loss of mimy when this precaution is neglected. They abovld 
also be cleared from the specks with scrupulous attentioD, 
either with the point of a small three pronged fork, while they 
are in the cup, or by strainiog the whole through a fine hur- 
aieve after they are beaten. Tiie perfect sweetness of suet and 
milk should be especially attended to, before they are mimd 
into a pudding, as nothing can be more oSensiTe than the fint 
when It is over-kept, nor worse in its efeot than' the curdling 
of the milk, which is the certain result of its being ever so 
slightly soured. 

Currants should be cleaned, and rainns stoned with exceed- 
ing care ; almonds and spices very finely pounded,- and the 
linds of oranges or lemons rasped or n^ted lightly off, that the 
bitter part of the skin may be avoided, when thev are used foi 
this, OT for any other class of dishes ; if pared, tney ahooM be 



Custard pudding to have a good appearance, must be 
mered only, but withont ceasing ; for it boiled in a quici 
careless manner, the surikce, instead of being smuotb

Telyety, will be full of holes, or honey-combed, as it is^ called, 
8nd the whey will flow from it and mingle with the sauce. A 
tliickly-buttered sheet of writing-paper should be laid between 
the custard mixture and tlie doth, before it is tied over, or the 
lid of the mould is closed upon it ; and the mould itselj^ or the 
bflsin in which it is boUed, and which should always be q^uite 
M, must likewise be well buttered ; and after it is lifted 
' from the water the pudding should be left in it for quite five 
minntes before it is dished, to prevent its breaking or spreading 
about 

Batter is much lighter when boiled in a doth, and al- 
lowed full room to swell, than when confined in a lAould : 
it should be well beaten the instant before it is poured into 
it, and put into the water immediatehr after it is securely 
tied. Toe doth should be moist and thickly floured, and tiie 
puddm^ should be sent to table as expeditiously as possible 
tfter it IS done, as it will quickly become heavy. This applies 
equally to all puddings made with paste, which are rendered 
ime^ble by any dday in serving them after they are ready: 
they should be opened a little at the top as so6n as they are 
taken frmn the boiler or stewpan. 

Flum-puddingB, which it is now customary to boil in moulds^ 
are both lighter aiid less dry, when dosely tied in stout dotiis 
^eU buttered and floured, especially when thev are made in 
pvt with bread ; hut when this is done, care should be taken 
not to allow them to bum to the bottom of the pan in which 
they are cooked ; and it is a good plan to lay a plate or dish 
under them, by way of precaution against this mischance : it 
^ not then so much matter whether they be kept floating 
or not. It is thduffht better to mix these entirely (except the 
liquid portion of tnem) the day before th^ are boiled, and it 
is perlups an advantage when they are of large size to do so, 
bat it is not really necessary for small or oommcm ones. 

A very little salt improves all sweet puddings, by taking off 
the msipidity, and bringing out the fiiil flavour of the other 
ingredients, but its presence should not be in the slightest d^ree 
^c^^Me. When brandy, wine, or lemon-juice is added to uem 
itdiodd be stirred in bimly, and by degrees, quite at last, as it 
would be likely otherwise to curdle the milk or eggs. 

Many persons prefer their pudding steamed ; but when this 
is not done, they would be dropped mto plenty of boiling water, 
and be kept well covered with it until they are ready to serve ; 
vid the boiling should never be allowed to cease for an instant, 
&r they soon beocnne heavy if it be interrupted. 



366 MODERN OOOKERT. QcHAP. XTH. 

Paddmg and dumpling cloths should not only he laid into 
plenty of water as soon as the^ are taken off, and hashed after- 
wards, as we shall direct, hut it is essential to their perfect sweet- 
ness that they should he well and quickly dried (in the open air 
if possihle), then folded and kept in a clean drawer. We have 
known them left wet hy a careless servant, until when hrougbt 
forward for use, they were as offensive almost as meat that had 
been too long kept. To prevent their ever imparting an 
unpleasant flavour when used, they should be washed in a ley 
made as follows ; but when fix)m any circumstance this cannot 
be done, and soap is used for them^ they should be rinsed, and 
soaked in abundance of water, which should be changed several 
times. 

A UEj OB LET, FOB WASHING PTJDDIN6-CIX>THS. 

To a pint of wood ashes pour three quarts of boiling water, 
and either wash the cloths in the mixture without straining it, or 
give them two or three minutes boil in it first, then let the whole 
cool together ; wash the cloths perfectly clean, and rinse them 
in abundance of water, changing it several times : this both takes 
the grease off, and renders them very sweet. Two ounces of 
soda dissolved in a gallon of water will answer almost as well) 
provided the rinsing afterwards be carefully attended to. 

TO CLEAN CUBBANTS FOB PUDDINGS OB CAKES. 

Put them into a cullender, strew a handftd of flour over them, 
and rub them with the hands to separate the lumps, and to detach 
the stalks ; work them round in the cullender, and shake it weQ, 
when the small stalks and stones will fall through it Nest 
pour plenty of cold water over the currants, drain, and spread 
them on a soft cloth, press it over them to absorb the moisture, 
and then lay them on a very clean oven-tin, or a large dish, and 
dry them very gradually (or they will become hard), eith^ in a 
cool oven, or before the fire, taking care in the latter case that 
they are not placed sufficiently near it for the ashes to M 
amongst them. When they are perfectly dry, clear them 
entirely from the remaining stalks, and from every stone that 
may be amongst them. The best mode of detecting these is to 
lay the fruit at the fiu* end of a large white dish, or sheet of 
paper, and to pass it lightly, and in very small portioDS> 
with the fingers, towards oneself, examining it closely as this 
is done. 

TO MIX BATTEB FOB PUDDINGS. 

Put the flour and salt into a bowl, and stir them tflgoUMr; 



CHAP.XTII.3 BelLED PUDDINGS.' 367 

whisk the ^gs thoroughly, stnuB them through a fine hair-sieve, 
uid add them very gradually to the flour; for if too much 
liquid be poured to it at once it will he full of lumps, and it ia 
easy, with care, to keep the hatter perfectly smooth. Beat it 
well, and lightly with tne hack of a strong wooden spoon, and 
after the eggs are added thin it with nmk to a proper consis-. 
tancy. The whites of the eggs heaten separately to a solid froth, 
and stirred gently into the mixture the mstant hefore it is tied 
up for boiling, or hefore it is put into the oven to he haked, will 
render it remarkahly light. When fruit is added to the hatter, 
it must be made thicker than when it is served plain, or it will 
sink to the bottom of the pudding. Batter should never stick 
to the knife whed it is sent to table ; it will do this hoth when a 
sufficient number of eggs are not mixed with it, and when it is 
not enough cooked. About four eggs to the half pound of flour 
will make it firm enough to cut smoothly. 

SUET-CBUST, FOB MEAT OS FBUIT FUDDINOS* 

Clear off the skin from some fresh beef kidney-suet, and with 
a sharp knife slice it thin, free it entirely from nbre, and mince 
it very fine : six ounces thus prepared will he found quite suffi- 
cient for a pound of flour. Mix them well together, add half a 
teaspoonful of salt for meat puddings, and a third as much for 
&uit ones, and sufiicient cold water to make the whole into a 
^ery firm paste ; work it smooth, and roll it out of equal thick- 
ness when it is used. The weight of suet should be taken after 
it is minced. This crust is so much lighter, and more whole- 
some than that which is made with butter, that we cannot refrain 
from recommending it in preference to our readers. Some cooks 
merely slice the suet in thin shavings, mix it with the flour, and 
W the crust with a paste roller, until the flour and suet are 
perfectly incorporated. 

Flour, 2 lbs.; suet, 12 ozs. ; salt, 1 teaspoonful; water, 1 
lant. 

BUTTEB CBUST FOB iPUDDINGS. 

When suet is disliked for crust, butter must supply its place, 
but there must be no intermixture of lard in paste which is to be 
boiled. Eight ounces to the pound of flour will render it suffi- 
ciently rich for most eaters, and less will generally be preferred; 
rich crust of this kind being more indigestible by far than that 
which is baked. The butter may be lightly broken into the 
flour before the water is added, or it may oe laid on, and rolled 
uito the paste as for puff-crust A small portion of salt must 



368 MODERN OOOKEBT. QcHAP. XTU. 

be added to it alwavB, and for a meat pudding the same propor- 
tion as directed in tne preceding receipt. For kitchen, or for 
quite common family puddings, butter and clarified dripping are 
used sometimes in equal proportions. From three to four 
ounces of each will be sufficient for the pound and quarter ef 
iour. 

Flour, 1 lb. ; butter, 8 ozb. ; salt, for fruit puddings, | salt-

BBEF-STBAK, OB JOHN BT7LL*S PUDDIHO. 

This, and all other meat puddings are more oonvenienti^ made 
in deep pans or basins having a thick rim, below which the 
doths can be tied without the nazard of their slipping ofi*; and 
as the puddings should by no means be turned out before they 
are sent to taUe, a basin or pan to match the dinner-serrioe, at 
least in colour^ is desirable.* Roll out a suet crust to half an 
inch in thickness, line evenly with it a quart, or any other sized 
basin that may be preferred, and raise the crust from^an inch and 
a half to two inches above tiie ed^e. FiU it with layers of veil- 
kept rump-steak, neatly trimmed and seasoned with salt and 
pepper, or cayenne ; pour in some cold water to make the gravy ; 
roU out the cover, moisten the edge, as well as that of tne 
pudding; draw and press them together careAilly, fold them 
over, ^ake out a cloth which has been dipped into hot water, 
wrung out, and well floured ; tie it over the pudding, gathff 
the comers together, tie them over the top of toe puddiii^, put 
it into plenty of fast boiling water, and let it remain in fitvn 
three to five nours, according to its size. The instant it is lifted 
out, stick a fork quite through the middle of the crust to pre- 
vent its btu^in^^ remove the cloth quickly, and cut a small 
round or square m the top to allow the steam to escape, andseire 
the pudding immediately. Though not considered verv adnus- 
sible to an elegantly served table, this is a fiivourite msh with 
many persons, and it is said to be in ^reat esteem with Sossex 
sportsmen, for whom it is often provided in preference to &re 
which requires greater exactness m the time of cooking; ts an

t luge pudding of this kind, b^ond ledndng the quantity of 
gnYjy and rendering it Teiy thick. 

Some cooks floor the meat slightly before it is laid into the 
met, but we do not think it an improvement: where fat is 
liked, a portion may be added with the lean, but all skin and 
sinew should be careftdly rejected. Beat the steak with a paste 
roller, should it not appear to be perfectly tender, and divide 
it into portions about the size of two fillers. Two or three 
dozens of oysters, bearded and washed free from grit in their 
own liquor (which should afterwards be strained and poured 
into the pudding), may be intermingled with the meat 

A true epicurean receipt for this dish directs the crust to be 
nade with oeaZ-kidney suet, and filled with alternate layers of 
the inside of the sirlmny sliced and seasoned, and of fine plump 
native oysters, intermixed with an occasional small slice of the 
yeal&t 

SMALL BBEF-STEAK PUDDINa. 

Make into a very firm, smooth paste, one pound of flour, six 
ounces of beef-suet, finely minced, naif a teaspoonful of salt, and 
half a pmt of cold water. Line with this a basin which holds a 
pint and a half. Season a pound of tender steak, free from bone 
and skin, with half an ounce of salt and half a teaspoouM 
of pepper well mixed together ;. lay it in the crust, pour in a 
Quarter-pint of water, roll out the cover, dose the puddmg care- 
fnlly, tie a floured cloth over, and boil it three hours and a half. 
We give this receipt in ad^tion to the preceding one, as an 
exact guide for the proportions of meat-puddings in general. 

Flour, 1 lb. ; suet, 6 ozs. ; salt, \ teaspoonfiil ; water, } pint; 
nunp-steak, 1 lb. ; salt, \ oz. ; pepper, \ teaspoonful ; water, i 
pint: 3^ hours. • 

BUTH PniCH*S BBET-STBAK PUDDIKO. 

To make Ruth Pinch's celebrated pudding (known also as 
beef-steak pudding a la Dickens), substitute six ounces of butter 
for the suet in this receipt, and moisten the paste with the well- 
beaten yolks of four eggs, or wit^ three whole ones, mixed with 
a little water ; butter the basin very thickly before the crust is 
laid in, as the pudding is to be turned out of it for table. In 
^ else proceed exactly as above. 

SUPERLATIVE BEEF-PUDDINO. 

Take a fine woodcock that is ready for the spit, and put it 
into the middle of a large beef-pudding, laying the meat under,

over, and nrand it ; finish it as nsoal, and boQ it four homn or 
more: the fine fiavour of the bird will pervade the whole con- 
tents of the pudding. 

HUTTOH PUBDIMG* 

Mutton fineed perfectly from hi, and mixed with two or three 
alioed kidneys, luikes an excellent pudding. The meat may be 
sprinkled with fine herbs as it is laid into the crust This will 
require rather less boiling than the preceding puddings, but it 
is made in precisely the same way. 

PABTBID6B PUDDIK6. 

Skin a couple of well-kept partridges and cut them down into 
joints ; line a deep basin witn suet crust, observing the directioiis 
given in the preceding receipts ; lay in the birds, which should 
be rather hi^ly seasoned with pepper or cayenne, and mode- 
rately with salt ; pour in water for the gravy, close the puddinff 
with care, and boil it from three hours to three and a hal£ 
The true flavour of the game is admirably preserved by this 
mode of cooking. When mushrooms are plentiful, put a layer 
of buttons, or small flaps, cleaned as for pickling, alternately 
with a layer of partridge, in filling the pudding, which urill 
then be most excellent eating : the crust may be left untouched, 
and merely emptied of its contients, where it is objected to; or 
its place may be supplied with a richer one made of butter. A 
seasoning of pounded mace or nutmeg can be used at discretioiL 
Puddings of veaJ, chickens, and joung rabbits, may all be made 
by this receipt, or with the addition of oysters, which we have 
already noticed.

COMMON UATTEB PUDDIMO. 

Beat four eggs thoroughly, mix with them half a pint of i 
milk, and pass them througn a sieve, add them by degrees^ \ 
half a pound of flour, and when the batter is perfectly smooth, 
thin it with another half pint of milk. Shake out a wet pod- 
ding doth, flour it well, pour the batter in, leave it room to 
swell, tie it securely, and put it immediately into j^enty of fitst- 
boiling water. An hour and ten minutes will bod it Send it 
to table the instant it is dished, with wine sauce, a hot compote 
of fruit, or raspberry vinegar : this last makes a delicious pnddii^ 
sauce. Unless the liquid be added veiy gradually to the floor, 
and the mixture be well stirred and lieaten as each portion is 
poured to it, the batter will not be smooth : to render it teiy 
light, a portion of the whites of the ^ggs, or the whole of tbeiD»

should be whisked to a froth and stirred into it just before it ia 
pat ioto the doth. 

Flour, i lb. ; eg^ 4; salt, | teaspoonful; milk, 1 pint: 1 hour 
and 10 minutes. 

0&9.— Modem taste is in fayour of paddings boiled in moulds, 
but, as we have already stated, they are seldom or eyer so light 
as those which are tied in cloths only. Where aqopearanoe is the 
tint consideratiQn, we would recommend the use of the moulds^ 
ofcomse. 

ANOTHEB BATTEB PUDDING. 

Mix the yolks of three ^gs smoothly with three heaped 
tablespoonsfal of flour, thin the batter with new milk until it is 
of the consistency of cream, whisk the whites of eggs apart, stir 
them into the batter, and boil the pudding in a floured cloth or 
buttered basin for an hour. Before it is served, cut the top 
quickly into large dice, half through the pudding, pour over it 
a small jarful of fine currant, raspberry, or strawberry jelly, and 
seud it to table without delay. 

Flour, 3 tablespoonsful ; eggs, 3; salt, | teaspoonful; milk, 
from ^ to a whole pint : 1 hour. 

Obs, — For a very large pudding, double the quantity of in- 
gredients and the time of boiling will be required. 

BLAG^-CAF PUDDING. 

Make a good light thin batter, and just before it is poured 
into the clotn stir to it half a pound of currants, well cleaned 
and dried ; these wiU sink to the lower part of the pudding and 
blacken the surface. Boil it the usual time, and dish it with the 
dark side uppermost ; send very sweet sauce to table with it. 
Some cooks butter a mould thickly, strew in the currants, and 
pour the batter on them, which produces the same appearance 
as when the ingredients are tied in a doth. 

BATTEB FBUIT PUDDING.

Butter thickly a basin which holds a pint and a half, and fill 
it nearly to the brim with good boilibg apples pared, cored, and 
quartered; pour over them a batter made with four table- 
^q)oonsfdl of flour, two large or three small eggs, and half a pint 
of milk. Tie a buttered and floured cloth over the basin, which 
ought to be quite fiill, and boil the pudding for an hour and a 
quarter. Turn it into a hot dish when done, and strew sugar 
diickly over it : this, if added to the bather at first renders it 
heavy. Moiella cherries make a vezy superior pudding of this

To a pound and a quarter of flour add half a pound of finely 
minced beef-suet,* half a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter one 
of pepper ; mix these into a smooth paste, with one well-beaten 
egg, and a little cold milk or water ; make it into the shane of 
a paste-roller, fold a floured cloth round it, tie the ends ti^iitl;^} 
and boil it for a couple of hours. Li Kent this puddm^ is 
usually sent to table with boiled beef, and is sometimes cooked 
with it also. It is very good sliced and broiled, or browned in 
a Dutch oven, after having become quite cold. 

Flour, li lb. ; suet, i lb.; sEdt, ^ teaspoonful; half as much

ANOTHEB SUET PUDDZNG. 

Make into a somewhat lithe, but smooth paste, half a poond 
of fine stale bread-crumbs, three quarters of a pound of floor, 
from ten to twelve ounces of beef-suet, chopped extremely 
small, a large half-teaspoonful of salt, and rather less of pepper, 
with two eggs and a little milk. Boil it two hours sm * 
quarter.

With a pound of flour mix well an equal weight of good 
potatoes boded and grated (or prepared oy Captain Em*

dipped into hot water, wrung dry, and shaken out; roll the 
paste thin, press it evenly into the basin upon the doth, fill it 
with apples, pared, cored, and quartered, or wiUi any other 
fruit; put on the cover, tiddng care to moisten the edges of the 
paste, to press them well together, and fold them over ; gather 
np the ends of the cloth, and tie it firmly close to the pudding, 
which should then be dropped into plenty of fast boiling water. 
When it is done, lift it out by twistinff a strong fork mto the 
corner of the cloth, turn it ^tly into the dish in which it is to 
be served, and cut immediately a small round or square from 
the top, or the pudding, will quickly become lieavy; send it to 
table without the slightest delay, accompanied by pounded, and 
|ty ^ood Lisbon sugar, as many persons prefer the latter, from 
its imparting a more mellowed flavour to the fruit. A small 
dice of fresh butter, and some finely grated nutm^, are usually 
considered improvements to an apple pudding ; tne juice* &nd 
the grated rind of a lemon may be added with good effect, when 
the froit is laid into the crust, especially in spring, when the 
apples genendly will have become insipid in their flavour, 
nhen puddings are preferred boiled in moulds or basins, these 
must be thickly buttered before the paste is laid into them, and 
the puddings must be turned from tnem gently, that they may 
not burst 

Currant, gooseberry, or cherry pudding, 1 to IJ hour. 
Gieengage, damson, mussel, or other plum, 1 to 1^ hour. 
Apple pudding, from 1 to 2 hours, according to its size, and 
the time of year. 

Ok.^Jf made of codlings, an apple pudding will require 
80 much boiling as may be needed for the crust. 



A COMMON APPLE PUDDING. 

Make a light crust with one pound of flour, and six ounces of 
very finely minced beef-suet, roll it thin, and fill it with one 
pound and a quarter of good boiling apples ; add the grated rind 
^d strained juice of a small lemon, tie it in a cloth, and boil it 
one hour and twenty minutes before Christmas, and from 
twenty to thirty minutes longer after Christmas. A small slice 
of fresh butter, stirred into it when it is sweetened will, to many 
tastes, be an acceptable addition; grated nutmeg, or a little 
cinnamon in fine powder, may be substituted for the lemon-rind 
when either is preferred. To convM this into a richer pudding 
Qse half a pound of butter for the crusf, and add to the apples a' 
■poonful or two of orange or quince marmalade.

THB PUBIJ8HEB*8 PUDDING. 

This pudding can scarcely be made too rich. First blanch, 
and then beat to the smoothest possible paste, six ounces of 
fresh Jordan almonds, and a dozen bitter ones; pour yery 
gradually to them, in the mortar, thre^ quarters of a pint of 
' boiling cream; then turn them into a cloth, and wring it from 
them again yii&i strong expression. Heat a full half pint of it 
afresh, and pour it, as soon as it boils, upon four ounces of fine 
bread-crumbs, set a plate over, and leave them to become nearly 
cold; then mix thoroughly with them four ounces of macaroons, 
crushed tolerably small ; five of finely minced beef-suet, fiye of 
marrow, cleared very carefully from fibre, and from the splinters 
of bone which are sometimes found in it, and shred not very 
small, two ounces of flour, six of pounded sugar, four of dried 
cherries, four of the best Muscatel raisins^ weighed afrer they 
are stoned, half a pound of candied dtron, or of citron and 
orange-rind mixed, a quarter saltspoonfrd of adt, half a nutm^, 
jthe yolks only of seven frdl-sized eggs, the grated rind of a lai]^ 
lemon, and last of all, a ^lass of the best Cognac brandy, whioi 
must be stirred briskly m by slow decrees. Four the mixture 
into a thickly buttered mould or basm, which contains a M 
quart, fill it to the brim, lay a sheet of buttered writing-paper 
over, then a well-floured cloth, tie th«n securely, and boil the 
pudding for four hours and a quarter; let it stand for a couple 
of minutes before it is turned out ; dish it carefully, and ser?e it 
with the German pudding saui^ of page 126. 

Jordan ahnonds, 6 ozs.; bitter almonds, 12; cream, f pmt;

HEB majesty's PUDDING. 



Infuse in a pint of new milk half a pod of vanilla, cut Jnto 
short lengths, and bruised ; simmer them gently together for 
twenty minutes, and strain the milk through muslin to half a 
pint of cream; put these again on the fire in a dean saucepim, 
with three ounces of fine sugar, and pour them, when they boil, 
to the beaten yolks of eight very fresh eggs. Stir ihe mixture 
often until it is nearly or quite cold, and boil it as gently 
a» possible *for an hour .in a well-buttered mould or basin 
that wfll just hold it. Let it stand for four minutes at least 
bdbre it is turned out ; dii^ it carefully, strew, and garnish it 
thickly with branches of preserved barberries, or send it to table 
with a rich syrup of fresh fruit, or with clear firuit-jelly, melted. 
We have had onen a compote (see Sweet Dishes) of currants, 
cherries, or plums served, and greatly relished with this pudding, 
which we can recommend to our readers as an extremely 
delicate one. The flavouring may be varied with bitter almonds, 
lemon-rind, noyeau, or aught else which may be better liked 
than the vanilla.

quantity of lemon-brandy, or of ratifia can be added, to give it 
flavour, when it is made, or the sugar mth which it is sweetened 
may be rasped on a lemon or an orai^e, then crushed and 
dissolved in the milk ; from an ounce and a half to two ounces 
will be sufficient for general taste. 

PKIlfCE ALBEBT*8 PUDDING. 

Beat to a cream half a jMund of fresh butter,* and mix with 
it by degrees an equal weight of pounded loaf-sugar, dried and 
sift;ed ; tdd to these, after they have been well b^iten together, 
first the yolks, and then the whites of five fresh ^gs, which 
have been thoroughly whisked apart; now strew ^htly in, 
half a pound of the finest fiour, dried and sift;ed, and L^ of all, 
half a pound of jar raisins, weighed after they are stoned. Pat 
these ingredients, perfectly mixed, into a well-buttered mould, 
or floured cloth, and boil the pudding for three hours. Serve 
it with punch sauce. We recommend a little pounded mace, or 
the grated rind of a small lemon, to vaiy the flavour of this 
ezceflent pudding ; and that when a mould is used, shoes of 
candied peel should be laid rather thickly over it after it is 
buttered.

boil, or it will instantly cnrdle ; pour it brer the padding, or, if 
preferred, send it to table in a tureen. We thmk a full tea- 
^)ooiifol of lemon-juice added to the wine an improvement to 
tnis sauce, which is excellent ; and we can recommend the pud- 
ding also to our readers. 

Milk, 1^ pint ; rice, 3 ozs. : 1 hour, or more. Suet, 3 ozs.;

We have already, in a previous part of the volume, directed 
that the German sauce should be milled to a fine firoth, and 
poured upon the pudding with which it is served : when this is 
not done, the quantity should be increased. 

A CABICrEIT PUDDING. 

Split and stOne three dozens of fine jar raisins, or take an 
equal number of dried cherries, and place either of them regu- 
Ijurly, in a sort of pattern, in a thickly-buttered plain quart 
mould or basin ; next, slice aiid lav into it three penny sponge- 
cakes; add to these two ounces of ratifias, four macaroons, an 
ounce and a half of candied citron, sliced thin, the yolks of four 
e^ with the whites of three onlv, thoroughly whisked, mixed 
with half a pint of new milk, then strained to half a pint of 
sweet cream, and sweetened with two ounces and a*half of 
pounded sugar : these ought to fill the mould exactly. Steam 
the pudding, or boil it very sently for one hour ; let it stand a 
few minutes before it is dished, that it may not break ; and 
serve it with good wine or brandy sauce. 

Jar raisins, or dried cherries, 3 dozens (quart mould or basin); 
sponge biscuits, 3 ; macaroons, 4 ; ratifias, 2 ozs. ; candied citron, 
U oz. ; yolks of 4 eggs, whites of 3 ; new milk, J pint ; cream, 
' ipint; sugar, 2| ozs. : steamed, or boiled, 1 hour. 

Obs. — ^W e have given this receipt, for which we are indebted 
to a friend, without any variation from the original, because on 
testing it we have found it very exact with regard to quanti^ 
and time ; but though an extremely delicate and excellent pud- 
ding, a little flavouring would, we think, improve it : a small 
portion of the milk may be omitted, and its place supplied by 
ratifia, lemon-brandy, or aught else that is preferred.

custard-mixture ; and remember that quick boiling will destroy 
the good appearance of this kind of pudding. The liquid should 
be quite cold before it is added to the c&es, or the butter on 
tiie mould would melt off, and the decorations with it: pre- 
served ginger^ and candied dtron in slices, may be used to vary 
these, and the syrup of the former may be added to give flavour

dosely and neatly together; fill it quite with a good custard, 
lay, uTBt a buttered paper, and then a floured cloth over it, tie 
them securely, and boil the pudding gently for an hour; let it 
stand for ten minutes after it is taken up before it is turned out 
of the mould. This is a more tasteml mode of serving the 
remains of a pliun-pudding than the usual one of broiling them 
in slices, or converting them into fritters. Hie German sauce, 
well milled or frothed, is generally much relished with sweet 
boiled-puddings, and adds greatly to their good appearance; 
but conunon wine, or punch-sauce, may be sent to table with 
the above quite as appropriately.

cleaned eurrants, four ounces of minced apples, fire of sugar, 
two of candied orange-rind, half a teaspoonral of nutmeg mixed 
with Dounded mace, a very little salt, a small ^lass of brandy, 
and three whole egps. Mix and beat these msredients well 
together, tie them tightly in a thickly floured doth, and boil 
them for three hours and a half. We can recommend this as a 
lenuurkahly light small rich pudding : it may be serVed with 
^^erman, wine, or punch sauce. 

Flour, 3 ozs. ; bread-crumbs, 3 ozs. ; suet, stoned raisins, and 
c^urants, each, 6 ozs. ; minced apples, 4 ozs.; sugar, 5 ozs. ; can-

A WELL PUDDING. 

Make into a firm smooth paste, with cold water, one pound 
of flour, six ounces of finely-minced beef-suet, three quarters of 
a pound of currants, ana a small pinch of salt, thoroughly 
iQued together. Form into a ball six ounces of good butter, 
ukl enclose it securely in about a third of the paste (rolled to a 
jialf inch of thickness), in the same way that an apple-dumpling 
is made ; roll out the remainder of the paste, and place the por- 
tion containing the butter in the centre of it, with the part 
where the edge was drawn together turned dovmwards : gather 
the outer crust round it, and after having moistened the edge, 
close it with great care. Tie the pudding tightly in a well- 
flonred cloth, and boil it for two hours and a half. It must be 
^hed with caution that it may not break, and a small bit must 

^ cat directly from the top, as in a meat pudding. (See page 

368). 

This is a very fiiyourite pudding in some parts of England; 
the only difficulty in making or in serving it, is to prevent the 
escape of the butter, which, if properly secured, will be found 
^ a li(juid state in the inside, on opening it. Some timid cooks 
fold it m three coverings of paste, the better to guard against its 
hunting through ; but there is no danger of this if the edges of 
the crust be well closed. When suet is objected to, seven ounces 
of butter may be substituted for it. The currants are occasion- 
ally omitted.

omitting two ounces of the bread, and adding more butter, one

floured cloth over it, and boil the pudding exactly an hour ; let 
it stand for two or three minutes before it is turned out, and 
serve it with sweet sauce, fruit syrup, or a compote of fresh 
fruit. An ounce and a half of candied orange-rind will improve 
it much, and a couple of ounces of butter may be added to 
enrich it, when the receipt without is considered too simple. It 
is excellent when made with milk highly flavoured with cocoa- 
ftut (see Chapter XX).

TOMATA DUMPIJNGS, OR PUDDINaS. 

(An American Receipt,) 

" In tne manner of composition, mode of cooking, and sancing, 
the good housewife must proceed in the same way as she would 
for an apple dumpling, with this exception, care must be taken 
in paring the tomata not to extract the seed, nor break the meat 
in the operation of skinning it. We have eaten tomatas raw 
without anything ; — cut up with pepper, salt, vinegar, and mus- 
tard ;t— tried in butter and in lard ; — broiled and basted with 
butter ; — stewed with and without bread, with cream and with 
butter ; — and, with a clear conscience, we can say. we like them 
in every way they have ever been fixed for the palcUe ; but of 
all the modes of dressing them, known to us, we prefer them 
when cooked in dumplings, for to us it appears that the steam- 
ing they receive in their dough-envelope increases in a veiy 
high degree that delicate spicy flavour which even in their 
uncooked state makes them such decided favourites with the 
epicure." 

Obs. — It is possible that the tomata, which is, we know, abun- 
dantly grovm and served in a great variety of forms in Ainerica, 
may there, either from a difference of climate, or from some 
advantages of. culture, be produced in greater perfection than 
with us, and possess really "the delicate spicy flavour,*' attri- 
buted to it in our receipt, but which we cannot say we have 
ever yet discovered here ; nor have we put its excellence for 
puddings to the proof^ though some of our readers may like to 
do so. 

FASmONABUB APPLE DUMPLINGS. 

These are boiled in small knitted or dosely-netted cloths (&e 
former have, we think, the prettiest effect), which give quite an 
ornamental appearance to an otherwise homely dish. like oat 
the cores without dividing the apples, which should be large, and 
of a good boiling sort, and All the cavity with oran^ or lemon

OBANGE SHQW-BALLS. 

Take out the miliusked grains, and wash well half a pound of 
rice; put it into plenty of water, and boil it rather quickly for 
ten minutes ; drain and let it cool. Fare four large, or five 
small oranges, and clear from them entirely the thick white 
inner skin ; spread the rice, in as many equal portions as there 
are oranges, upon some pudding or dumpling cloths ; tie the 
fruit separately in these, and boil the snow-£dls for an hour 
and a half; turn them carefully on to a dish, and strew plenty 
of sifted sugar over them.

APPLB SNOW-BAIXS. 

Fare and core some large pudding-apples, without diyiding 
than, prepare the rice as in the foregoing receipt, enclose them 
in it, and boil them for one hour : ten nunutes less will be suffi- 
cient should the fruit be but of moderate size. An agreeable 
addition to them is a slice of fresh butter, mixed with as much 
sugar as can be smoothly blended with it, and a flavouring of 
powdered cinnamon, or of nutm^ : this must be sent to table 
apart from them, not in the dish. 

UGHT CVJIRAJXT DUMPLINGS. 

For each dumpling take three tablespoonsful of flour, two of 
finely-minced suet, and three of currants, a slight pinch of salt, 
and as much milk or water as will make a thick batter of the 
ingredients. Tie the dumplings in well-floured cloths, and boil 
them for a full hour : they may be served with very sweet wine 
sauce. 

I^MOK DUMPLINGS. 

Mix, with ten ounces of fine bread-crumbs, half a pound of 
beef-suet, chopped extremely small, one large tablespoonful of 
flour, the grated rinds of two small lemons, or of a very large 
one, four ounces of pounded sugar, three large, or four small 
eggs beaten and stramed, and last of all the iuice of the lemons, 
^ strained. Divide these into four equal portions, tie them 
in well-floured cloths, and boil them an hour. The dumplings 
will be extremely light and delicate ; if wished very sweet more 
sugar must be added to them. '

is made by adding sufficient milk to the flour to form a thick

HOKFOLK DUMPIJirGS. 

Take a pound of dough from a baking of very light white 
bread, and divide it into six equal parts; mould these into 
dumplings, drop them into a pan of &st boiling water, and boil 
them qiuckly from twelve to fifteen minutes. Send them to 
table the instant they are dished, with wine sauce or raspberry 
vin^ar. In some counties they are eaten with melted butter, 
well sweetened, and mixed with a little vin^ar. They must 
never be cut, but should be torn apart with a couple of forks. 

SWKST BOILED PATTIES. (gOOD.) 

l^fiT into a very smooth paste, three ounces of finely-minced 
suet, with eight of flour, and a slight pinch of salt ; divide it 
into fourteen balls of equal size, roll tnem out quite thin and 
round, moisten the edges, put a little preserve into each, close 
the patties very securely to prevent its escape, throw them into 
a pan of boiling water, and in from ten to twelve minutes lift 
them out, and serve them instantly. Biitter-crust may be used 
for them instead of suet but it will not be so light. 

Flour, 8 ozs. ; suet, 3 ozs. ; little salt ; divided into fourteen

BOILED BICE TO BE SEBVED WITH STEWED FBUTTS, PBE8EBVBS, 

OB BASPBEBBT YINEGAB. 

Take out the discoloured grains from half a pound of good 
rice ; and wash it in several waters ; tie it very loosely in a 
pudding doth and boil it for three quarters of an hour ; it will 
then be quite solid, and resemble a pudding in appearance. 
Sufficient room must be given to allow the grain to swell to its 
full siae, or it will be hard ; but too much space vnll render the 
whole watery. With a little experience the cook will easily 
ascertain the exact degree to be allowed for it. Four ounces of 
rice will require quite half an hour^s boiling ; a little more or 
less of time wiU sometimes be needed, from the difference of 
quality in the grain.

CHAPTER XVm. 
BAKED PUDDINGS. 




Odteau de Riz, or French Sice Pudding. 



nVTBODUCTOBT BEMABKS. 

We have little to add here to the remarks which will be 
found at the commencement of the preceding Chapter, as they 
will apply equally to the preparation of these and of boiled 
puddings. 

All of the custard kind, whether made of eggs And milk only, 
or of sago, arrow-root, rice, ground or in grain, vermicelli, &c^ 
require a very gentle oven, and are spoiled by fast-baldng. 
Those made of batter, on the contrair, should he put into one 
sufficiently brisk to raise them quickly, but without scorching 
them. Such as contain suet and raisins must have a well- 
heated, but not a fierce oven ; for as they must remain long in 
it to be thoroughly done, unless carefully managed, they will 
either be much too highly coloured, or too diy. 

By whisking to a solid froth the whites of the ^gs used for 
any pudding, and stirring them softly into it at the instant of 
placing it in the oven, it will be rendered exceedingly light, and 
will rise very high in the dish ; but as it will partake then of 
the nature of a soufflS, it must be despatched with great expe- 
dition to table from the oven, or it will become flat before it is 
served. 

When a pudding is sufficiently browned on the surface (that 
is to say, of a fine equal amber-colour) before it is baked 
through, a sheet of writing paper should be laid over it, but not 
before it is set : when quite firm in the centre, it will be done. 

Potato, batter, plum, and every other kind of pudding in- 
deed, which is sufficiently solid to allow of it, should be turned ' 
reversed on to a clean hot dish from the one in which it is 
baked, and strewed with sifled sugar, before it is sent to table.

Grate very lightly six ounces of the crumb of a stale loa^ smd 
put it into a deep dish. Dissolve in a quart of cold new milk 
four ounces of good Lisbon sugar ; add it to five large, well- 
whisked eggs; strain^ and mix them with the bread-cmmbs ; 
stir in two ounces of a fresh finely-grated cocoa-nut; add a 
flavouring of nutmeg or of lemon-rin{ and the slightest pinch 
of salt ; let the pudmng stand for a couple of hours to soas the 
bread ; and bake it in a gentle oven for three quarters of an 
hour : it is excellent if carefrQly made, and not too quickly 
baked. When the cocoa-nut is not at hand, an ounce of but- 
ter just dissolved, should be poured over the dish before the 
crumbs are put into it ; and the rind of an entire lemon may be 
used to give it flavour; but the cocoa-nut imparts a pecoliar 
richness when it is good and fresh. 

Bread-crumbs, 6 ozs. ; new milk, 1 quart ; sugar, 4 ozs ; eggs, 
5 ; cocoa-nut, 2 ozs. ; (or rind, 1 large lemon, and 1 oz. butter)

sugar may be increased.

On two ounces of fine white bread-crumbs pour a pint pf 
boiling cream, and let them remain until nearly cold, then mix 
them very gradually with half a pound of sweet and six bitter 
almonds pounded to the smoothest paste, with a little orange- 
flower water, or, when this is not at hand, with a few drops of 
spring water, just to prevent their oiling ; stir to them by de- 
grees the well-beaten volks of seven and the whites of three 
eggs, six ounces of sifted sugar, and four of clarified batter; 
turn the mixture into a very dean stewpan, and stir it without 
ceasing over a slow fire until it becomes tnick, but on no aoeoont 
allow it to boil. When it is tolerably oool add a glass of 
brandy, or half a one of noyeau, pour the padding into a dish 
lined with very thin puff paste, and bake it half an boor in a

I^. When a very power^l flavour of the irmt is liked, an 
Mditional lemon may be used in either of these receipts. The

S^ted. A couple of sponge-biscuits soaked in cream, then 

pressed dry, and very finely bitdsed, can be substituted for the

brisk oven, but draw it towards, the mouth when it is of a fine 
brown colour. Turn it from the dish before it is served, and 
strew sifted sugar oyer it or not, at pleasure : two ounces more of 
suet can be added when a larger proportion is liked. The pud- 
ding is very good without the currants.

BAKBWSLL PUDDING. 

This pudding is famous not only in Derbyshire, but in several 
of our northern counties, where it is usually served on all 
holiday-occasions. Line a shallow tart-dish with quite an inch- 
deep layer of several kinds of good preserve mixed together, 
and intermingle with them from two to three ounces of candied 
citron or orange-rind. Beat well the yolks of ten eggs, and add 
to them gradually half a pound of sined sugar ; when they are 
well mixed, pour in by degrees half a pound of good clarified 
butter, and a little ratifia or any other flavour that may be pre- 
ferred ; fill the dish two thirds full with this mixture, and bake 
the pudding for nearly an hotu* in a moderate oven. Half the 
quantity wUl be sufi&cient for a small dish. 

Mixed preserves, 1 J to 2 lbs. ; yolks of eggs, 10 ; sugar, j lb. ; 
butter, i lb. ; ratifia, lemon-brandy, or other flavouring to the 
taste : baked, moderate oven, | to 1 hour. 

Ob». — This is a rich and expensive, but not a very refined 
pudding. A variation of it, known in the south as an Alder- 
man's Pudding is, we think, superior to it. It is made without 
the candied x)eel, and with a layer of apricot-jam only, six ounces 
of butter, six of sugar, the yolks of six, and the whites of two 

eggs. 

BATIFIA PUDDING. 

Flavour a pint and a half of new milk rather highly with 
bitter almonds, blanched and bruised, or, should their use he 
objected to, with three or four bay leaves and a little cinnamon; 
add a few grains of salt, and from four to six ounces of sugar in 
lumps, according to the iaste. When the whole has simmered 
jgentiy for some minutes, strain off the milk through a fineaeye 
or muslin, put it into a clean saucepan, and when it again boils 
stir it gradually and quickly to six well-beaten eggs which have 
been l&ewise strained ; let the mixture cool, and th^ add to it 
a fflass of brandy. Lay k half-paste round a well-battered 
dian, and sprinkle into it an ounce of ratifias finely Gromble^

grate the rind of a lemon over,* and place three ounces of whole 
ratifias upon them, pour in sufficient of the custard to soak 
them ; an hour afterwards add the remainder, and send the 
puddiag to a gentle oven : half an hour will bake it.

THE ELEGANT ECONOMI8T*8 PUDDING. 

We have already given a receipt for an exceedingly good 
boUed pudding bearing this title, but we think the baked one 
answers even better, and it is made with rather more facility. 
Butter a deep tart-dish well, cut the slices, of plum-pudding to 
join exactly in lining it, and press them against it lightly to 
make them adhere, as without this precaution they are apt to 
float off; pour in as much custard (previously thickened and 
left to become cold), or any other sweet pudding mixture as will 
fill the dish sdmost to the brim ; cover the top with thin slices 
of the plum pudding, and bake it in a slow oven from thirty 
minntes to a Ml hour, according to the quantity and quality of 
the contents. One pint of new milk poured boiling on an 
ounce and a half of tons les mots, smoothly mixed with a quarter 
pint of cold milk, makes with the addition of four ounces of 
^gar, four small eggs, a little lemon-grate, and two or three 
bitter almonds, or a few drops of ratifia, an excellent pudding of 
this kind; it should be baked nearly three quarters of an hour 
m a quite slack oven. Two ounces and a half of arrow-root 
may be used in lieu of the totis les mots, when this last is not 
procurable. We would especially recommend for trial the 
mgredients of the lemon-pudding of page 391,t with the plum- 
pudding crust, as likely to make a very superior variety of this 
dish ; we have not had it tested, but think it could scarcely fail. 
It must be well, though slowly baked. 

BICH BBEAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. 

, Give a good flavour of lemon-rind and bitter almonds, or of 
cinnamon, if preferred, to a pint of new milk, and when it has 
simmered a sufficient time for this, strain and mix it with a 
juarter-pint of rich cream ; sweeten it with four ounces of sugar 
m lumps, and stir it while still hot to five well-beaten eggs ; 

* A. more delicate flavour is imparted by raming the lemon-rind on sugar, and 
adding this to the mixture.

thickly-butter^ dish three layers of thin bread and butter cut 
from a half-auartem loa^ with four ounces of currants, and 
€ae and a half of finely shred candied peel, strewed between and 
over them ; pour the eggs and milk on them by degrees, letting 
the bread absorb one portion before another is add^: it should 
soak for a couple of hours before the pudding is taken to the 
oven, which should be a moderate one. Half an hour will bake 
it. It is very good when made with new milk only; and some 
persons use no more than a pint of liquid in all, but part of the 
whites of the eggs may then be omitted. Cream may be 
substituted for the entire quantity of milk at pleasure. 

New milk, 1 pint ; rind of small lemon, and 6 bitter almonds 
bruised (or | drachm of dnnamon): simmered 10 to 20 
minutes. Cream, i pint; sugar, 4 ozs.; eggs, 6; brandy, 1

ones, grate half a nutmeg to them, and pour the mixture into 8 
dish which holds nearly three pints, and which is filled almost 
to the brim with layers of bread and butter, between which 
three ounces of currants have been strewed. Lemon-giatet ^ 
orange-flower water can be added to this pudding instead of 
nutmeg, when preferred. From three quarters of an hoar to

without ceasing ; take it from the fire, let it cool a little, and 
stir to it briskly, and by degrees, the yolks of six eggs and the 
whites of four well beaten together, and strained or prepared for 
use as directed at page 364: four or five bitter almonds, 
pounded with a little sugar, will heighten the flavour pleasantly 
to many tastes. When the puddmg is nearly cold, pour it 
gently into a stewpan or mould, prepared as for the G&tean de 
liiz of page 397, and bake it in a very gentle oven &om anhour 
and a quarter to an hour and a half. 

SUTHERLAin) OB CASTLE PUBniNGS. 

Take an equal weight of eggs in the shell, of ^ood butter, of 
fine dry flour, and of sifled sugar. First, whisk the ^gs for ten 
minutes, or until they appear extremely light ; then throw in 
the sugar by degrees, and continue the whisking for four or 
five minutes ; next, strew in the flour, also gradually, and when 
it appears smoothly blended with the other ingredients, pour 
the butter to them in small portions, each of which shpnld be 
beaten in until there is no appearance of it left. It ^ould pre- 
viously be just liquefied with the least possible degree of heat; 
this may be effected by putting it into a well-warmed saucepan, 
and shaking it round until it is dissolved. A grain or two of 
salt should be thrown in with the flour ; and the rind of half 
a fine lemon rasped on sugar, or grated, if more convenient, 
or some pounded mace, or the store-flavouring of page 139, ean 
be added at choice. Pour the mixture, directly it is ready, into 
well-buttered cups, and bake the puddings from twenty to 
twenty five minutes. When cold, they resemble good pound 
cakes, and may be served as such. Wine sauce should be sent 
to table with them. 

Eggs, 4 ; their weight in flour, sugar, and butter; little 93^] 
flavouring of pounded mace or lemon-rind. 

Obs, — Three eggs are sufficient for a small dish of these pnd- 
dings. Thay may be varied with an ounce or two of candied 
citron ; or with a spoonful of brandy, or a little orange flowff 
water. The mode we have given of making them will be found 
perfectly successful if our directions be loUowed with exact- 
ness, in a slack ovto they will not be too much baked in hali 
an hour.

MADELEINE PUDDINGS 

(To be served cold.) 

Take the same ingredients as for the Sutherland puddings, 
but clarify an additional ounce of butter; skim, and then fill 
some round tin pattypans with it almost to the brim, pour it 
from one to the other until all have received a sufficient coating 
to prevent the puddings from adhering to them, and leave half 
a teaspoonful in each ; mix the remainder with the eggs, sugar, 
and flour, beat the whole up very lightly, fill the pans ak)ut 
two thirds full, and put them directly into a rather brisk oven, 
but draw them towards the mouth of it when they are suflfi- 
• ciently coloured; from fifteen to eighteen minutes will bake 
them. Turn them out, and drain them on a sheet of pap^r. 
When they are quite cold, with the point of the knife take out 
a portion of the tops, hollow the pudding a little, and fill them 
with rich apricot-jam, well mixed with half its weight of 
pounded almonds, of which two in every ounce should be bitter 
ones. 

A FRENCH BICE PUDDING, OB GATEAU DB BIZ. 

Swell gently in a quart of new milk, or in equal parts of 

inilk and cream, seven ounces of the best Carolina rice, which 

bas been cleared of the discoloured grains, and washed and 

drained ; when it is tolerably tender, add to it three ounces of 

fresh butter, and five of sugar roughly powdered, a few grains 

of salt, and the lightly grated rind of a fine lemon, and simmer 

the whole until the rice is swollen to the utmost ; then take it 

from the fire, let it cool a little, and stir to it quickly, and by 

d^rees, the well-beaten yolks of six full-sized eggs. Pour 

into a small copper stewpan* a couple of oimces of clarified 

bntter, and incline it in such a manner that it may receive an 

equal coating in every part ; then turn it upside down for an 

instant, to drain oiF the superfluous butter; next, throw m 

some exceedingly fine light crumbs of stale bread, and shake 

them entirely over it, turn out those which do not adhere, and 

with a small brush or feather sprinkle more clarified butter 

sh'ghtly on those which line the pan. Whisk quickly the 

whites of the eggs to snow, stir them gently to the rice, and 

pour the mixture softly into the stewpan, that the bread- 

cnunbs may not be displaced; put it immediately into a mode- 

* One which holds about five pints is well adapted to the purpose. When this

1 large lemon : f to li hour. Eggs, 6 : baked in a moderate 
oven, 1 hour. 

Obs, — An admirable variety of this gateau is made with 
cocoa-nut flavoured milk, or cream (see Chapter XX.), or 
with either of these poured boiling on six ounces of Jordan 
almonds, finely pounded, and mixed with a dozen of bitter 
ones, then expressed from them with strong pressure; it may 
likewise be flavoured with vanilla, or with candied orange- 
blossoms, and covered at the instant it is dished, with straw- 
berry, apple, or any other dear jelly. 

A COMMON BICE PUDDING. 

Throw six ounces of rice into plenty of cold water, tod boil 
it gently from eight to ten minutes ; drain it well in a sieve or 
strainer, and put it into a clean saucepan with a quart of milk; 
let it stew until tender, sweeten it with three ounces of sugar, 
stir to it, gradually, three large, or four small eggs, beaten and 
strained ; add grated nutmeg, lemon-rind, or cinnamon, to give 
it flavour, and bake it one hour in a gentle oven. 

Rice, 6 ozs.; in water, 8 to 10 minutes. Milk, 1 quart: 
f to 1 hour. Sugar, 3 ozs. ; eggs, 3 large, or 4 small ; flavoiir- 
ing of nutmeg, lemon-rind, or cinnamon : bake 1 hour, gentle

BICHEB BICE PUDDING. 

Pick and wash very clean four ounces of whole rice, pour on 
it a pint and a half of new milk, and stew it slowly tul qoi^ 
tender ; before it is taken from the fire, stir in two ounees of 
good butter, and three of sngar ; and when it has cooled a Uttlei 
add four well- whisked eggs, and the grated rind of half » 
lemon. Bake the pudding in a gentle oven from thirty to 
forty minutes. As rice requires long boiling to render it soft » 
milk, it may be partially stewed in water, Sie quantity of mjlj 
diminished to a pint, and a little thick siiv'eet cream mtffid H^ 
it, before the other ingredients are added.

SICE PUDDING MEBmGU^. 

SweU gently four ounces of Carolina rice in a pint and a 
quarter of milk or of thin cream ; let it cool a little, and stir to 
it m ounce and a half of butter, three of pounded sugar, a 
grain or two of salt, the grated rind of a small lemon, and the 
yolks of four large, or of five small eggs. Pour the mixture 
into a well-butter^ dish, and lay lightly and equally over the 
top the whites of four eggs, beaten as for sponge cakes, and 
mixed at the instant with from four to five heaped tablespoons- 
M of sifted ^gar. Bake the pudding half an hour in a mode- 
rate oven, but do not allow the meringue to be too deeply 
coloured ; it should be of clear brown, and very crisp. Serve it 
directly it is taken from the oven. 

Rice, 4 ozs.; milk, or cream, 1 J pint; butter, Ijoz.; sugar, 
3 ozs.; rind, 1 lemon; yolks of eggs, 4 or 5 ; the whites beaten 
to snow, and mixed with as many tablespoonsfdl of sifted sugar : 
baked } hour, moderate oven. 

Obs.—X couple of ounces of Jordan almonds, with six bitter 
ones, pounded quite to a paste, will improve this dish, whether 
mixed with the pudding itself, or with uie meringue. 

GOOD GROUND BICE PUDDING. 

Mix very smoothly five ounces of flour of rice (or of ground 
rice, if preferred), with half a pint of milk, and pour it into a 
pint and a half more which is boiling fast ; keep it stirred con- 
stantly over a gentle fire from ten to twelve minutes, and be 
particularly careful not to let it bum to the pan; add to it 
wfore it is taken from the fire, a quarter of a pound of good 
butter, from five to six ounces of sugar, roughly powdered, and 
a half-saltspoonftLl of salt; turn it into a pan, and stir it for a 
few minutes, to prevent its hardening at the top ; then mix with 
it, by degrees, but quickly, the yolks of eight eggs, and the 
whites of only two, the grated or rasped rind of a fine lemon, 
^d a glass of brandy. Lay a border of rich paste roimd a 
buttered dish, pour in the pudding, strain a little clarified 
butter over the top, moisten the paste with a brush, or small 
buiich of feathers dipped in cold water, and sift plenty of sugar 
on it, but less over the pudding itself. Send it to a very g«itle 
ovea to be baked for three quarters of an hour.

Obif, — These proportions are sufficient for a pudding of larger 
size than those served usually at el^ant tables; they will make 
two small ones ; or two thirds of the quantity may be taken for 
one of moderate size. Lemon-brandy or ratifia, or a portion oi 
each, may be used to fi;iye it flavour, with good effect; and it 
inay be enriched, if tnis be desired, by adding to the other 
ingredients from three to four ounces of Jor^^ almonds, finely 
pounded, and by substituting cream for half of the milk. 

COMMON GXOUND BICE PUDDEBIIS. 

One pint and a half of milk, three ounces and a half of rice, 
three of Lisbon sugar, one and a half of butter, some nutmeg, 
or lemon-grate, and four eggs, baked dowly for half an houfi 
or more, if not quite firm. 

GKBEN QOOSEBEBBT PUDDIITG. 

Boil toother, from ten to twelve minutes, a pound of green 
goosebemes, five ounces of sugar, and rather more than a 
quarter-pint of water ; then beat the fruit to a mash, and stir to 
it an ounce and a half of fresh butter ; when nearly, or quite 
cold, add two ounces and a half of very fine bread-crumbs, and 
four well-whisked ^gs. Bake the pudding half an hour. To 
make a finer -one or the kind, work the fruit through a sieve, 
mix it vnth four or five cxushed Naples biscuits, and use double 
the quantity of butter. 

Green gooseberries, 1 lb. ; sugar, 5 ozs.; water, full ^ pint: 
10 to 12 minutes. Bread-crumbs, 2^ ozs. ; eggs, 4 : ^ hour. 

Obs. — Spring fruit (rhubarb), is sometimes made into this 
kind of pudding, but we cannot particularly recommend it It 
is infinitely better in a tart, or as a compote. 

POTATO PUDDING. 

With a pound and a quarter of fine mealy potatoes, boiled 
very diy, and mashed perfectly smooth whue hot, mix three ' 
ounces of butter, five and a half of sugar, five eggs, a few grains 
of salt, and the grated rind of a small lemon. Four the miztuie 
into a well-buttered dish, and bake it in a moderate oven for 
nearly three quarters of an hour. It should be turned out and 
sent to table with fine sugar sifted over it ; or for variety, red 
currant jelly, or any other preserve may be spread on it as soon 
as it is cQshed.

Obs.— When cold, this pudding eats like cake, and may be 
served as such, omitting, of course, the sugar or preserve, when 

it is dished. 

A BICHEB POTATO PUDDING. 

Beat well together fourteen ounces of mashed potatoes, four 
ounces of butter, four of fine sugar, five eggs, the grated rind of 
a small lemon, and a slight pinch of salt ; add half a glass of 
brandy, and pour the puddmg into a thickly-buttered dish, 
ornamented with slices of candied orange or lemon rind; pour a 
little clarified butter on the top, and Uien sift plenty of white 
sugar over it. 

Potatoes, 14 ozs. ; butter, 4 ozs. ; sugar, 4 ozs. ; eggs, 5 ; lemon

40 minutes. 

06^.— The potatoes for these receipts should be lightly and 
carefiilly mashed, but never pounded in a mortar, as that will 
convert them into a heavy paste. The better plan is to prepare 
them by Captain Kater's receipt (page 302), when they will fall 
to powder ^most of themselves ; or they may be grated while 
hot through a wire-sieve. From a quarter to a naif pint of 
cream is, by many cooks, added to potato puddings. 

AN EXCEIXENT SPONGE CAKE PUDDING. 

Slice into a well-buttered tart-dish three penny sponge cakes, 
and place on them a couple of ounces of candied orange or 
lemon-peel cut in strips. Whisk, thoroughly six eggs, and stir 
to them boiling a pint and a quarter of new miSs, in which 
three ounces of sugar have been dissolved; grate in the rind of 
a small lemon, and when they are somewhat cooled, add half a 
^eglassful of brandy ; while still warm, pour the mixture on 
to the cakes, and let it remain an hour ; then strain an ounce 
and a half of clarified butter over the top, sift or strew pounded 
ragar rather thickly on it, and bake the pudding for half an hour 
in a moderate oven.

with six ounces of sugar, and a spoonful or two of water: stir 
them often that they may not stick to the pan. Mix with tbem 
while they are stiU quite hot, three ounces of butter, the grated 
rind and the strained juice of a lemon, and lastly, stir in by 
degrees the well-beaten yolks of five ^gs, and a dessertspoonful 
of flour, or in lieu of the last, three or four Naples* biscuits, or 
macaroons crushed smalL Bake the pudding for a full half

tender.* Before it is taken firom the fire, scrape into it the out- 
side of some sugar which has heen mbbed upon the rind of a 
fiesh lemon. Have ready a tin mould of pretty form, well 
battered in every part ; press the rice into it while it is still hot, 
smooth the sur&ce, and let it remain till cold. Should the 
mould he one which opens at the ends, like that shewn in the 
plate at 334, the puddmg will come out eaaly ; but if it should 
be in a plain common one, just dip it into hot water to loosen it; 
turn out the rice, and then again reverse it on to a tin or dish, 
and with the point of a knife mark round the top a rim of about 
an inch wide ; then brush some clarified butter over the whole 
pudding, and set it into a brisk oven. When it is of an equal 
£eht ^Iden brown draw it out, raise the cover careMy 
where it is marked, scoop out the rice from the inside, leaving 
only a crust of about an inch thick in every part, and pour into 
it some preserved firuit warmed in its own syrnpf or fill it with 
a connote of plums or peaches (see Chapter XX) ; or with soooe 
good apples boiled with fine sugar to a smooth rich marmalade. 
This is a very good as well as an elegant dish : it may be en- 
riched with more butter, and by substituting cream for the milk 
in part, or entirely, but it is excellent without either.

glass of brandy : bake it from half^ to three quarters of an hour. 
V ermicdli varies much in quality, and of some kinds three 
ounces will render the pudding quite firm enough.

GOOD TOBKSHniB PT7DDING. 

To make a very good and light Yorkshire pudding, take an 
equal number of eggs and of heaped tablespoonsfuls of flour, 
^h a teaspoonfol of salt to six of these. Whisk the eggs well, 
strain, and mix them gradually with the flour, then pour in by 
d^rees as much new milk as will reduce the batter to the con- 
sistency of rather thin cream. The tin which is to receive the 
pudding must have been placed for some time previously imder 
a joint that has been put down to roast : one of beef is usually 
preferred. Beat the batter briskly and lightly the instant 
before it is poured into the pan, watch it carefimy that it may 
not bum, and let the edges have an equal share of the fire. 
When the pudding is quite firm in every part, and well- 
coloured on the surface, turn it to brown the under side. This 
is best accomplished by first dividing it into quarters. In 
Yorkshire it is made much thinner than in the south, roasted 
generally at an enormous fire, and not turned at all : currants 
there are sometimes added to it. 

Eggs, 6 ; flour, 6 heaped tablespoonsfiil, or from 7 to 8 o^. ; 
milk, nearly or quite, 1 pint ; salt, 1 teaspooilAil : 2 hours. 



400 KODERN COOKERT. [cHAP. XTin. 

Obsi, — ^This pudding should be quite an inch thick when it is 
browned on both sides, but only half the depth when roasted 
in the Yorkshire mode. The cook must exercise her discretioii 
a little in mixing the batter, as from the variation of weight in 
flour, and in the size of eggs, a little more or less of milk may 
be required : the whole should be rather more liquid than for a 
boiled pudding. 

COMMON TOSKSHIBE PUDDING. 

Half a pound of flour, three eggs (we would recommend 
a fourth), rather more than a pint of milk, and a teaspoonful 
of salt. 

NOBMANDT PUDDING. (OOOD.) 

Boil, until very soft and dry, eight ounces of rice in a pint 
and a half, or rather more, of water,* stir to it two ounces of 
tresb. butter, and three of sugar, and simmer it for a few minutes 
after they are added ; then pour it out, and let it cool for use. 
Strip from the stalks as many red currants, or Kentish cherries, 
as will fill a tart-dish of moderate size, and for each pint of the 
fruit allow from three to four ounces of sugar. Line the bottom 
and sides of a deep dish with part of the rice; next, patina 
thick layer of fruit and sugar ; tnen one of rice and one of frait 
alternately until the dish is ftill. Sufficient of the rice should 
be reserved to form a rather thick layer at the top : smooth 
this equally with a knife, and send the pudding to a moderate 
but not very slow oven, for half an hour, and more, should it 
be large. When two thirds baked, it may be glazed with yolk 
of egg, brushed over, and fine sugar sifted on it. Morella 
cherries, with a little additional sugar, make an excellent pad- 
ding of this kind. 

DAMSON-AND-BICB PUDDING. 

With five ounces of whole rice boiled soft and dry, mix an 
ounce of butter, ten oimces of damson-jam, a teaspoonfol <i^ 
lemon-juice, and five eggs. Beat the whole well together, and 
bake it about half an hour.

APPLE-AND-BICE PUDDING. 

' Boil together one pound of good pudding-apples, and six 
ounces of sugar, until they are reduced to a smooth pulp ; stir 
them often to prevent their burning; mix with tnem four 
ounces of boiled rice, two ounces of butter, and five large eggs. 
Should the apples be very acid, increase the quantity of sugar : 
add lemon rind or juice, at pleasure. These puddings are better 
if mixed while the ingredients are still warm.

COMMON RAISIN PUDDING. 

Beat well together three quarters of a pound of flour, the 
same quantity of raisins, six ounces of beef-suet, finely chopped, 
a small pinch of salt, some grated nutmeg, and three eggs 
which have been thoroughly whisked, and mixed with about 
a quarter-pint of milk, or less than this, should the eggs be 
large. Four the whole into a buttered dish, and bake it an 
hour and a quarter. For a large pudding, increase the quan- 
tities one half.

weighed after they are stoned, ten oimces of finely minced beef- 
suet, three quarters of a pound of flour, a little salt, half a small 
nutmeg, or the grated rind of a lemon, four large eggs, and as 
much milk as may be needed to make the whole into a very 
thick batter : bake the pudding a few minutes longer than the 
preceding one. IThe addition of sugar will be found no im« 
provement as it will render it much less light.

PUDDING k LA PATSANNE. 

(Cheap and good,) 

FiU a deep tart-dish with alternate layers of well-sugared 
fruit, and veiy thin slices of the crumb of a light stale loaf; let 
the upper layer be of fruit, and should it be of a diy kind, 
sprinlde over it about a dessertspoonful of water, or a little 
lemon-juice : raspberries, currants, and cherries, will not require 
this. Send the pudding to a somewhat brisk oven to be baked 
for about half an hour. The proportion of sugar used must be 
regulated, of course, by the acidity of the fruit. For a quart of 
ripe greengages, split and stoned, five ounces will be sumdent 
Apricots, peaches, and nectarines wiH scarcely require more; 
but damsons, bullaces, and various other plums will need a much 
larger quantity. A superior pudding of this kind is made by 
substituting sponge cake for the bread. 

INDIAN PUDDING. 

Put into a deep dish from six to eight ounces of rice which 
has been washed, and wiped in a dry cloth; just moisten it 
with milk, and set it into a gentle oven; add milk to it at 
intervals, in small quantities, until the grain is swollen to its 
friU size, and is tender, but verv dry ; then mix with it two 
dessertspoonsful of fine su^, and if it should be at hand, four 
or five tablespoonsful of rich cream. Fill a tart-dish almost to 
the brim with fruit properly sugared^ heap the rice eoually over 
it, leaving it rough, and hike it in a moderate oven for lialf an 
hour, umess tbe fruit should be of a kind to require a longer 
time ; when very hard, it must be half stewed with the ^xga 
before it is put into the dish. The rice mav be swelled orcr « 
very slow fire when more convenient ; and the Dutch or Ameri- 
can oven will serve quite well to bake the pudding.

OBSERVATIONS ON OMLETS, TBITTEBS, &C. 

The composition and nature of a souffle are altogether different, 
but there is no difficulty in making good omlets, pancakes, or 
fritters, and as they may be expeditiously prepared and served, 
they are often a very convenient resource when, on short notice, 
an addition is required to a dinner. The eggs for all of them 



410 MODERN COOKERY. []CHAP. XtX, 

should be well and lightly whisked ; the lard for frying batter 
should be extremely pure in flavour, and quite hot wnen the 
fritters are dropped in ; the batter itself should be smooth as 
cream, and it snould be briskly beaten the instant before it is 
used. All fried pastes should he perfectly draiijed from the fat 
before they are served, and sent to table promptly when they 
are ready. Eggs may be dressed in a multiplicity of ways, hut 
are seldom, in any form, more relished than in a well-made and 
expeditiously served omlet. This may be plain, or seasoned 
with minced herbs, and a very little eschalot, when the last is 
liked, and is then called an ^^ Omlette aux fines herbes ;** or it 
may be mixed with minced ham, or grated cheese ; in any case, 
it should be light, thick, frdl-tasted, Bud fried only on one side ; 
if turned in the pan, as it frequently is in £nglaitd, it will at 
once be flattened and rendered tough. Should the slight raw- 
ness which is sometimes found in ^e middle of the inside, what 
the omlet is made in the French way, be objected to, a heated 
shovel, or a salamander, may be held over it for an instant, 
before it is folded on the dish. The pan for frying it shoold be 
quite small ; for if it be composed of four or five eggs onl^, and 
then put into a large *one, it will necessarily spread over it and 
be thin, which would render it more like a pancake than an 
omlet ; the only partial remedy for this, when a pan of pro- 
per size cannot be had, is to raise the handle of it high, and to 
keep the opposite side close down to the fire, which will confine 
the effgs into a smaller space. No gravy should ever be poured 
into the dish with it, and indeed, if properly made, it will require 
none. Lard is preferable to butter for frying batter, as it ren- 
ders it lighter ; but it must not be used for omlets. 

A COMMON OMLET. 

From four to eight very fresh eggs may be used for thk 
according to the sized dish required. Half a dozen will gene- 
rally be sufficient. Break them singly and carefully; clear 
them in the way we have already pointed out in the introduc- 
tion to boiled puddings, or when they are sufficiently whisked 
pour them through a sieve, and resume the beating mitil thej 
are very light. Add to them from half to a whole teaspoonftl 
of salt, and a seasoning of pepper. Dissolve in a small frying' 
pan a couple of ounces of butter, pour in the eggs, and as soon 
as the omlet is well risen and firm throughout, slide it on to » 
hot dish, fold it together like a turnover, and serve it «»*^ 
diately ; from five to seven minutes will fry it. 



CHAP. XIX.] SOUPFLis, OMLETS, &C. 411 

For other varieties of the omlet, see the observations which 
precede this. 

AN OBILETTE SOUFFL^E. 

Separate, as they are broken, the whites from the yolks of six 
fine fresh eggs; beat these last thoroughly, first by themselves 
and then with four tablespoonsful of diy, white sifted sugar, and 
the rind of half a lemon grated on a fine grater.* Whisk the 
whites to a solid froth, and just before the omlet is poured into 
the pan, mix them well, but lightly, with the yolks. Put four 
ounces of fresh butter into a very small delicately dean 
omlet, or frying pan, and as soon as it is all dissolved, add 
the eggs and stir them round, that thev may absorb it entirely. 
When the under side is just set, turn the onuet into a well-but- 
tered dish, and send it to a tolerably brisk oven. From five to 
ten minutes wiU bake it ; and it must be served the instant it 
is taken out ; carried, indeed, as quickly as possible to table from 
the oven. It will have risen to a great height, but will sink 
and become heavy in a very short space of time : if sugar be 
sited over it, let it be done vdth the utmost expedition. 

Eggs, 6; sugar, 4 tablespoonsful; rind, ) lemon; butter, 
4 ozs. : omlet baked, 5 to 10 minutes. 

Obs, — ^A large common fr3ang-pan will not answer for omlets: 
a very small one should be kept for them, when there is no re- 
gular omlet-pan. 



SOUFFLES. 



The admirable lightness and delicacy of a well-made souffle 
render it generally a very favourite dish, and it is now a fashion- 
able one also. It may be greatly varied in its composition, but 
in all cases must be served the very instant it is taken from the 
oven; and even in passing to the dining-room it should, if pos- 
sible, be prevented from smking by a heated iron or salamander 
held above it. A cpmmon souffle-pan may be purchased for 
four or five shillings, but those of silver or plated metal which 
are of the form shown at the commencement of this chapter, are 
of course expensive; the part in which the souffle is baked is 
placed within the more ornamental dish when it is drawn from 
the oven. A plain, round, shallow cake-mould, with a strip of 
writing paper six inches high, placed inside the rim will answer 
on an emergency to bake a souffle in. The following receh>t 
will serve as a guide for the proper mode of making it : the 

* As we have before said, a much more delicate flavour is imparted by raipmg 
the lemon-rind on sugar.

process is alwayB the same whether the principal ingredient l)e 
whole rice hoUed very tender in milk and pressed through a 
sieve, hread-crumhs soaked as for a pudding and worked through 
a sieve also, arrow-root, potato-flour, or ought else of which 
light puddings in general are made. 

Take from a pint and a half of new milk or of cream sufficient 
to mix four ounces of flour of rice to a perfectly smooth hatter ; 
put the remainder into a very clean, well-tinned saucepazi, and 
when it hoils, stir the rice briskly to it ; let it simmer, keeping it 
stirred all the time, for ten minutes, or more should it not be 
very thick, then mix well with it two ounces of fresh butter, one 
and a half of pounded sugar, and the grated rind of a fine lemon 
(or let the sugar which is used for it be^well rubbed on the lemon 
before it is crushed to powder) ; in two or three minutes take it 
from the fire, and beat quicldy and carefully to it by degrees 
the yolks of six eggs ; whisk the whites to a very firm solid 
froth, and when the pan is buttered, and all else quite ready for 
the oven, stir them gentlv to the other ingredients ; pour the 
souffle immediately into tne pan and place it in a moderate oven, 
of which keep the door closed for a quarter of an hour at least 
When the souffle has risen very high, is of a fine colour, and 
quite done in the centre, which it will be in from half to three 
quarters of an hour, send it instantly to table. The exact time 
far baking it depends so much on the oven that it cannot be 
precisely specified. We have known quite a small one not too 
much bak^ in forty-five minutes in an iron oven ; but gene- 
rally less time will suffice for them : the heat, however, shoold 
always be moderate. 

New milk or cream, 1} pint; flour of rice, 4 ozs.; fresh 
butter, 2 ozs. ; poimded sugar, 1^ oz. ; eggs, 6 ; grain of salt; 
rind, 1 lemon : 30 to 45 minutes. 

Obs. 1. — ^The souffle may be flavoured with vanilla, orange- 
flowers, or ought else that is liked. Chocolate and coflee u» 
may be used for it with soaked bread : a very strong infoaon 
of the last, and an ounce or two of the other, melted with s 
little water, are to be added to the milk and bread. 

Obs. 2. — A souffle is conunonly served in a dinner of cere' 
mony as a remove of the roast, but the better plan for this, as 
for a fondu, is to have it quickly handed round, instead </ 
being placed upon, the table. 

LOUISE FSANK^S CITRON SOUFFL^. 

To obtain the flavour of the citron-rind for this cdebraled 
Swedish souffle, take a lump of sugar which weighs two ounces 



CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFJ^is, OMLETS, &C. 413 

and a half, and rub it on thq fruit to extract the essence, or 

should the citron not be sufficiently fresh to yield it by this 

means, pare it off in the thinnest possible strips and infuse it, 

by the side of the fire, in the cream of which the souffle is to 

be made. Should the first method be pursued, crush the sugar 

to powder, and dry it a little before it is added to the other 

ingredients. Blend very smoothly two ounces of potato-flour 

vrith a quarter of a pint of milk, and pour boiling to them a 

pint of good cream ; stir the mixture in a large basin or bowl 

uctil it thickens, then throw in a grain of salt, two ounces of 

^h butter just dissolved in a smail saucepan, and the sugar 

which has been rubbed on the citron ; or should the rind have 

been pared the same weight, some of which is merely pounded. 

Add next, by degrees, the thoroughly whisked yolks of six 

^^ 6gg8> or of seven, should they be very small. Beat the 

whites %htly and quickly, until they are sufficiently firm to 

remain standing in points when dropped from the whisk ; mix 

them with the other ingredients, at the mouth of the oven, but 

without heating them ; fill the souffle -pan less than half full ; 

set it instantly into the oven, which should be gentle, but not 

exceedingly slack, close the door inunediately, and do not open 

it for fifteen or twenty minutes: in jfrom thirty to forty the 

souffle will be ready for table unless the oven should be very 

fiiow: a fierce degree of heat will have a most unfavourable 

effect upon it. 

Rind of half citron (that of a .Seville orange may be sub- 
stitnted on occasions) ; sugar, 2} ozs. ; cream, 1 pint ; potato- 
flour, 2 ozs. ; milk, i pint ; butter^ 2 ozs. ; yolks and whites of 
6 large or of 7 sniall eggs : 30 to 40 minutes, or more in very 
slow oven. 

A Fomou. 

Mix to a smooth batter, with a quarter of a pint of new 
milk, two ounces of potato-flour, arrow-root, or tous les mots : 
pour boiling to them three quarters of a pint more of milk, 
or of cream in preference, stir them well together, and then 
throw in two ounces of butter cut small. When this is 
nielted, and well-beaten into the mixture, add the well- whisked 
yolks of four large or of five sniall eggs, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, something less of cayenne, and tlburee ounces of lightly- 
grated cheese, Parmesan or English, or equal parts of both. 
Whisk the whites of the eggs to a quite firm and solid froth ; 
then proceed, as for a souffle, to mix and bake the fondu. 

20 minutes.

pxAiN COMMON Fmrrsss. 

Mix with three well-beaten eggs a quarter-pint of milk, and 
strain them through a fine sieve ; add them gradually to three 
large tablespoonsM of flour, and thin the batter with as much 
more milk as will bring it to the consistency of cream ; beat it 
up thoroughly at the moment of using it, that the fritters may 
be light. Drop it in small portions from a spouted jug or 
basin into boiling lard; when lightly coloured on one side, 
torn them, drain- them well irom the lard as they are lifted 
out, and serve them very quickly. They are eaten generally 
with fine sugar, and orange or lemon juice : the first of these 
may be sifted thickly over them after they are dished, the 
oranges or lemons cut in two, and sent to table with them. 
The lard used for fiying them should be fresh and pure- 
flavoured : it renders them more crisp and light than butter, 
and is, therefore, better suited to the purpose. 

£^8, 3 ; flour, 3 tablespoonsful ; milk, i to ^ pint. 

PANCAKES. 

These may be made with the saipe batter as fritters, if it he 
sufficiently thinned with an additional egg or two, or a little 
milk or cream, to spread quickly over the pan : to firy them 
well, this ought to be small. When the batter is ready, heat 
the pan over a clear fire and rub it with butter in every part, 
then pour in sufficient batter to spread over it entirely, and let 
the pancake be very thin: in this case it will require no 
turmng, but otherwise it must be tossed over with a sudden 
jerk of the pan, in which the cook who is not somewhat expert 
will not always succeed; therefore the safer plan is to make 
them so thin that they will not require this. Keep them hot 
before the fire until a sufficient number are ready to send to 
table, then proceed with a second supply, as they should always 
he quickly served. Either roll them up and strew fine sugar 



CHAP. XIX.] SOUFFlis, OMLETS, &C. 415 

over them, or spread them quickly with preserve, laying them 
one on the other. A richer kind of pancake may he made 
with a pint of cream, or of cream and new milk mixed, five 
^;g8, or their yolks only, a couple of ounces of flour, a little 
pounded cinnamon or lemon-rind rasped on sugar and scraped 
into them, with two ounces more of pounded sugar, and two 
ounces of clarified butter : a few ratifias rolled to powder may 
be added at pleasure, or three or four macaroons. 
From 4 to 5 minutes. 

FBITTEBS OF CAKE AKD PUDDING. 

Cut plain pound, or rice cake into small square slices half an 
inch thick ; trim away the crust, fry them slowly a light 
brown, in a small quantity of fresh butter, and spread over 
them when done a layer of apricot-jam, or of any other pre- 
sence, and serve them immediately. These fritters are im- 
proved by being moistened with a little good cream before they 
are fried: they must then be slightly floured. Cold plum 
pudding sliced down as thick as the cake, and divided into por- 
tions of equal size and good form, then dipped into French or 
English batter, and gently fried, will also make an agreeable 
Tariety of fritter. 

MSICBlifiAT fBUTEBS. 

With half a pound of mincemeat mix two ouncer of fine 
bread-crumbs (or a tablespoonful of flour), two eggs well 
beaten, and the strained juice of half a small lemon. JVlix these 
veil, and drop the fritters with a dessertspoon into plenty of 
very pure lard or fresh butter ; fry them from seven to eight 
nunutes, drain them on a napkin or on white blotting paper, 
and send them very hot to table : they should be quite small.

FBTTTEBS OF SPBEffG IHUIT. 

The rhubarb for these should be of a good sort, quickly 
grown, and tender. Pare, cut it into equal lengths, and throw 
it into the French batter of page 129 ; with a fbrk lift the 
stalks separately, and put them into a pan of boiling lard or 
butter : in firom five to six minutes they will be done. Drain 
them well and dish them on a napkin, or pile them high with- 
out one, and strew sifted sugar plentifiiUy oyer them: they

After having stripped the outer rind from the oranges, remove 
carefully the white inner skin, and in slicing them take out the 
pips; then. dip them into the batter and proceed as for the 
apple flitters. The peaches and apricots should be meie^ 
skumed, halved, and stoned before they are drawn through 
the batter, unless they should not be fully ripe, when iOf 
must first be stewed tender in a thin syrup.

croquettes as usual. As, from the difference of quality, the 
same proportions of rice and milk will not always produce the 
^e effect, the cook must use her discretion in adding, should 
It be needed, suffident liquid to soften the rice perfectly : but

This is the French name for small fried pastry of various 
forms, filled with meat or fish previonsly cooked ; they may be 
made with brioche^ or with light puff-paste, either of which 
must be rolled extremely thin. Cut it witn a small round cutter 
fluted or plain; put a little rich mince, or good pounded meat, 
in the centre, and moisten the edges, and press them securely 
together that they may not burst open in the frying. The 
rissoles may be formed like snudl patties, by laying a second 
round of paste over the meat; or, like cannelons; they mar, 
likewise, be brushed with egg, and sprinkled with yermicelli, 
broken small, or with fine crumbs. They are sometimes made 
in ^the form of croquettes^ the paste being gathered round the 
meat, which must form a ball. | 

In frying them, adopt the same plan as for the croquettes, 
raising the pan as soon as the paste is lightly coloured. Serve 
all these fried dishes well drained, and on a napkin. | 

From 5 to 7 minutes, or less.

centre of one naif, moistening the edges with water, or white of 
egg, lay the remaining rounds over these, close them securely? 
and fry them in butt^ a fine light brown ; drain and diy tbep

put some of the fish into eadi of these, moisten the edges with 
wliite of egg, fold and press them securely tocher, and when

ter ; fiy them a pale brown, drain them well, and dry them on 
white blotting-paper, laid upon a sieve, reversed ; but do not 
place them somciently near to scorch or to colour them. 

TO BOIL PIPE HACCABONI. 

We have found alirays the continental mode of dreadng 
^'^^ccaroni the best. English cooks sometimes soak it in mi£ 
^d water for an hour or more, before it is boiled, that the pipes 
Djay be swollen to the utmost, but this is apt to render it pulpy, 
though its appearance may be improved by it. Drop it lightly, 
a^d by d^rees, into a lai^e pan of &st-boiling water, into which 
a Kttle salt, and a bit of butter the size of a walnut, hdve pre- 
viously been thrown, and of which the boiling should not be 
stopped by the addition of the maccaroni. In fiom three quar- 
^ of an hour to an hour this will be sufficiently tender ; it 
should always be perfectly so, as it is otherwise indigestible, 
though the pipes should remain entire. Pour it into a large 
<^ender, and drain the water well from it It should be very 
80% boiled after the first minute or two. 

I to 1 hour. 

BIBBAKD MACCABONI. 

^^ is dressed in precisely the same manner as the pipe 
?Jj?*roni, but requires only from fourteen to sixteen minutes* 
oouing in water, and twenty or more in broth or stock. 

DBESSED MACCABONI. 

Four ounces of pipe maccaroni is sufficient for a small dish, 
^ from six to eight should be prepared for a femily partjr 
^pere it is liked. The common English mode of dressing it is 
^J^grated cheese, butter, and cream, or milk. French cooks 
substitute generally a spoonful or two of very strohg rich jellied 
8^vy for the cream ; and the Italians, amongst their many 
other modes of serving it, toss it in rich brown gravy, with 
^cient grated cheese to flavour the whole strongly ; they send 
* to table idso simply laid into a good Espagnole or brown 
f^^ (that drawn from the stufato, for example), accompanied 
y a plate of grated cheese. Another, and an easy mode of 
'iressing it is to boil and drain it well, and to put it mto a deep 



422 MODERN COOKBRT. [^GHAP. XIX. 

dish, strewing gnted cheese on evioj layer, and ad^Kng bits of 
fiiesh butter to it. The top, in this ease, should be covered 
with a layer of fine bread-cmmbs, mixed with grated cheese; 
these should be moistened plentifully with clarified batter, and 
eolour given to them in the oven, or before the fire ; the crumbs 
may be omitted, and a lay»r of cheese substituted for them. As 
excellent preparation of maocanmi may be made with any well- 
fiavoured, dry white cheese, which can be grated easily, at nraeh 
less cost than with the Parmesan, which is expensive, and in the 
country not always procurable even ; we think that the rich 
brown g^ravy is also a great advantage to the dish, which is 
further improved b;^ a toleraUy high seasoning of csyenne. 
These, however, are innovations on the usual modes of flerring 
it in England. 

After it has been boiled quite tender, drain it weU, dissoire 
firom two to three oimces of good butter in a dean sfcenpan, vitb 
a few spoonsful of rich cream, or of white sance, lay in put (A 
tiie maocaroni, strew part of the cheese upon it, add the r&- 
niainder of the maccaroni and the cheese, and toss the whole 
gently until the ingredients are well incorporated, and sdhere to 
the maccaroni, leaving no liquid perceptible : serve it immediately. 

Maccarom*, 6 ozs. ; butter, 3 ozs. ; Parmesan cheese, 6 os. ; 
cream, 4 tablespoonsfuL 

Obs. — If preferred so, cheese may be strewed thickly ovff 
the maccaroni after it is dished, and just melted and browned 
with a salamander.

This is a verv excellent and delicate mode of dressing foafx^ 
roni. Boil eight ounces in the usual way (see page 421), ^ 
by the time it is sufficiently tender, dissolve gentiy ten ounce?

a pint of good cream ; add a little salt, a rather full seasoning » 
cayenne, from half to a whole saltspoonful of pounded ma^ 
and a couple of ounces of sweet fresh butter. The cheese shonli 
in the first instancy be sliced very thin, and taken qnite five o^ 
the hard part adjoining the rind ; it should be stirred in tv 
cream ¥dtnout intermission until it is entirely dissolved, and W 
whole is perfectly smooth : the maccaroni, previoasly w^ 
drained, may then be tossed gently in it, or after it i'.^^^ 
the cheese may be poured equally over the maccaroni. T» 
whole, in either case, may be thickly covered before it v sent to

Pound and press through the back of a hair-aeve, the M

wise, take out the yolks, pound them to a paste with a um 
of their volume of fresh butter; then add the anchovies, a 
quarter-teaspoonful of mace, and as much cayenne as m 
season the mixture well ; beat these together thoroughly, m 
fill the whites of egg neatly with them. A morsel of garuc 
not larger than a pea, perfectly blended with the other mff^ 
dients, would to some tastes greatly improve this .preparation: a 
portion of anchovy-butter (see page 127), or of potted ham, 
will supply the place of the fish in it very advantageously. ^

COCOA-NUT FLAYOUIlEi) MILK. 

(^For sweet dishes, ^c.) 

Fare the dark outer rind from a very fresh nut, and gnie it 
on a fine and exceedingly clean grater ; to every three ounces 
pour a quart of new milk, and simmer them very softly for three 
quarters of an hour, or more, that a foil flavour ofthe nut may 
be imparted to the milk without its being much reduced; strain 
it through a fine sieve, or cloth, with sufficient pressure to leave 
the nut almost dry : it may then be used for blamange, custards, 
lice, and other puddings, U^ht cakes and bread. 

To each qmrt new mi&, 3 ozs. grated cocoa nut : I to I 
hour. 

Obs. — The milk of the nut, when perfectly sweet and good, 
may be added to the other with advantage. To obtain it, bore 
one end of the shell with a gimlet, and catch the liquid in a 
cup ; and to extricate the kernel, break the shell with a ham- 
mer : this is better than sawing it asunder. 

COMPOTES OP PBurr. 

We would particularly invite the attention of the reader to 
these wholesome and agreeable preparations of fruit, which are 
much less served at English tables, generally, than they deserve 
to be. We have found them often peculiarly acceptable to 
persons of delicate habit who were forbidden to partake of 
pastry in any form ; and accompanied by a dish of boiled rice< 
they are very preferable for children, as well as for invalids, tfi 
either tarts or puddings. 

Compote of spring fruit, — (Rhubarb.) Take a pound of the 
stalks after they are pared, and cut them into short leogth^i' 
have ready a quarter-pint of water boHed eently for ten na- 
nutes with five ounces of sugar, or with six should the fruit be 
very acid ; put it in, and simmer it for about ten mmUs. 
Some kinds will be tender in rather less time, some will require 
more.

Ohs.— Good sugar in lumps should be used generally for these 
dishes, and when they are intended for dessert the syrup should 
be enriched with an additional ounce or two. Lisbon sugar will 
answer for them very well on ordinary occasions, but that which 
is refined will render them much more delicate. 

Compote of ^een currants, — Spring water half pint ; sugar 
five ounces ; boiled together ten minutes. One pint of green 
currants stripped from the stalks ; simmered three to five mi- 
nutes. 

Compote of sreen gooseberries. — This is an excellent compote 
if made with fine sugar, and very good with any kind. Break 
five ounces into smaU lumps and pour on them half a pint of 
water ; boil these gently for ten minutes, and clear off all the 
scum ; then add to them a pint of fresh gooseberries freed from 
the tops and stalks, washed, and well drained. Sinmier them 
gently from eight to ten minutes, and serve them hot or cold. 
Increase the quantity for a large dish. 

Compote of green apricots. — ^Wipe the down from a pound of 
quite young apricots, and stew them very gently for nearly 
twentv minutes in syrup made with eignt ounces of sugar 
and three quarters of a pint of water, boiled together the usual 
time. 

Compote of red currants. — A quarter-pint of water and five 
ounces of sugar: ten minutes. One pint of ready picked 
currants to be just simmered in the syrup from five to six 
minutesi This receipt will serve equally for raspberries, or for 
a compote of the two fruits mixed together. Either of them 
^ be found an admirable accompaniment to batter, custard, 
bread, around rice, and various other kinds of puddings, as well 
as to whole' rice plainly boiled. 

Compote of Kentish or Flemish cherries. — Simmer five ounces 
of sugar with half a pint of water for ten minutes; throw into 
the syrup a pound or cherries weighed after they are stalked, 
pid let . them stew gently for twenty minutes ; it is a great 
improvement to stone the fruit, but a larger quantity will then 
^ required for a dish. 

Compote of Morella cherries. — Boil together for fifteen 
minutes, five ounces of sugar with half a pint of water ; add a 
pound and a quarter of ripe Morella oierries, and simmer 
them very softly from five to seven minutes : this is a delicious 
compote. 

Compote of Damsons. — Four ounces of sugar and half a pint 
of water to be boiled for ten minutes; one pound of damsons 
to be added, and simmered gently from ten to twelve minutes. 



430 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XX. 

CompoU of the Madman Bomtmj or other large p&wu.— Boil 
six onnees oi soffar with half a jHnt of water me usual time ; 
take the stalks ntnn a pound of plums, and simmer them veiy 
softfy for twenty minutes. Increase the proportion of sugar n 
needed, and regulate the time as may be necessaiy for the 
diiierait varieties of fruit. 

Compoie of ImUaee^ — The large, or shepherds' bullace) is 
yery good stewed, but wiD require a considerable quantity of 
sugar to render it palatable, unless it be quite ripe. Make a 
syrup with eight ounces, and three quarters of a pint of water, 
and boil in it sently from fifteen to twenty minutes, a pint and a 
half of the buUaoes freed from their stalks. 

Coa^pote of Siberitm crabs. — To three quarters of a pint t£ 
water add six ounces of fine sugar, bcMl them for ten or twelve 
minutes, and skim them well. Add a pound and a half of 
Sbeiian crabs without their stalks, and keep tlunn just at the 
pomi of boilmg for twenty minutes; they will ibea become 
lender without bursting. A lew strips of lemon-rind and a 
of the juice are sometimes added to this cofii|9ote. 



GOMPOTB OF FSACHBS. 

Tue half a dozen ripe peaches, and stew them veiy 
from e^teen to twenty minutes; keeping them often turned in 
a light syrup, made with &Te ounces of sugar, and half a pint of 
water boiled together for ten minutes. Dish the fruit ; reduce 
the ayrup by quick boiling, pour it over the peaches, and serve 
them hot Ibr a second-course dish, or cold for dessert They 
should be quite ripe, and will be found delicious dressed thus. 
A little lonon-juice maybe added to the syrup, and the blanched 
kmieb of two or three peach or apricot stones.

When this fruit is first ripe it requires, from its excessiye 
acidity, nearly its weight of sugar to render it palatable; but 
after hanging some time upon the trees it becomes much mel- 
lowed in flayour, and may be sufficiently sweetened with a 
smaller proportion. According to the stiUe of the fruit then^ 
take for each pound (leaying it in bunches) from twelve to 
sixteen ounces of sugar, and boil it with three quarters of a 
pint of water until it forms a syrup. Throw in the bunches of 
fruit, and simmer them for five or six minutes. If their weight 
of sugar be used, they will become in that time perfectly trans- 
parent As all yessds of tin affect the colour of the barberries^ 
they should be boiled in a copper stewpan, or in a Grerman 
enamelled one, which would be mr better.

serve it for dessert, or for the second course : in tlie latter case 
decorate it with spikes of almonds blanched, and heap solid

of one «nd a half, cut very thin, the whites and shells of four 
large eggs, and half an ounce of isinglass. Let these remain a. 
few minutes off the fire, that the sugar may dissolve more 
ewily; then let the jelly be' brought to boil gradually, and do 
not stir it after it begins to heat. When it baa boiled gently

AKOTHEB KECEIFT TOR CALF^S FEET JEIXT. 

To four calf *8 feet, well cleaned and divided, pour a gaUon 
of water, and let them stew until it is reduced to rather less 
than two quarts ; or if, after the flesh has quite fallen ftom the 
bones, the fiquor on being strained olQT should exceed that quan- 
tity, reduce it by rapid boiling in a clean uncovered pan oTer a 
veiy clear fire. When it is p^ectly firm and cold, take it, 
dear of fat and sediment, and add to it a bottle of sheny, whiek 
should be of good quality (for poor, thin wines are not weH 
adapted to the purpose), three quarters of a pound of sngv 
broken small, the juice of five lurse or of six moderate-siffd 
lemons, and the whites, with the sheUs finely crushed, of seven 
eggs, or of more, should they be very smaU. The rinds of three 
lemons, pared exceedingly thin, may be thrown into the jelly a 
few minutes before it is taken firom the fire ; or they may ^ 
put into the jelly-bag previously to its bein^ poured througk 
when they will impart to it a s%ht and delicate flavour, w- 
out deepening its colour much. K it is to be moulded, some- 
thing more tnan half an ounce of isinglass should be droM)ed 
lishtly in where the liquid becomes visible through the head 
of scum, when the mixture begins to boil; for if not soffidently 
finn, it will break when it is dished. It may be roughed, or 
served in glasses without this addition ; and in a liquid state 
will be found an admirable ingredient for Oxford, or other 
punch.

lemons, and the thin rinds of one and a half, with the whites 
and shells of eight e^gs. Let it boil gently for ten minutes, 
then straui it througna fiannel-bag, and when cool put it into 
moulds. It will be very clear, and firm, and of pleasant flavour. 
Apples of good quality should be used for it, and the quantity 
of sugar must be regulated by the time of year, as the fruit 
will haye lost much of its acidity during the latter part of the 
season. This receipt, which is the residt of our own experi- 
ment, and which we have found very successful, was first tried 
iiist after Christmas, with pearmains and Kipstone pippins. A 
little syrup of preserved ginger, or a small glass of fine white 
brandy, would perhaps, to some tastes, improve the jelly ; but 
we give it simply as we have had it proved ourselves.

Obs, — ^We would recommend the substitution of quinces for 
ap^es in this receipt as likely to aiford a very agreeable variety 
of the jelly : or equal portions of the twp fruits might answer 
well. 

Unless the stock be very stiff, add isinglass to this, as to the 
calfs feet jelly, when it is to be moulded. 

ORANGE CALEBS FEET JELLY. 

To a pint and a half of firm calfs feet stock, put a pint of 
strained China orange -juice, mixed with that of one or two 
lemons ; add te these six ounces of sugar, broken small, the 
i^ery thin rinds of three oranges and of one lemon, and the 
whites of six eggs with half the shells crushed small. . Stir 
these gently over a clear fire until the head of scum begins to 
form, but not at all afterwards. Simmer the jelly for ten mi- 
BQtes &om the first fiUl boil ; take it from the fire, let it stand 
a little, then pour it through a jelly-bag until perfectly clear. 
This is an original, and entirely new receipt, which we can re- 
commend to the reader, the jelly being very pale, beautifully 
transparent, and delicate in flavour : it would, we think, be 
peculiarly acceptable to such invalids as are forbidden to take 
ynne in any form. 

The proportions both of sugar and of lemon-juice must be 
somewhat varied according to the season in which the oranges 
are used.

I.EMON calf's feet JELLT. 



Break up a quart of strong calfs feet stock, wbich should haye 
l)eep measured while in a bquid state ; let it be quite clear of 
fat and sediment, for which a small additional quantity should 
be allowed ; add to it a not yeiy full half-pint of strained lemon- 
iuice, and ten ounces of sugar, broken small (rather more or 
less according to the state of the fruit), the rind of one lemon 
pared as thin as possible, or of from two to three when a fuU 
fiayour of it is liked, and the whites, with part of the sheila 
crushed small, of fiye large or of six small eggs. Proceed as for 
the preceding jellies, and when the mixture has boiled fiy« 
minutes throw m a small pinch of isinglass ; continue the boiling 
for fiye or six minutes longer, draw the pan from the fire, let it 
stand to settle ; then turn it into the jelly-bag. We haye found 
it always perfectly dear with once passing through ; but should 
it not be so, pour it in a second time. 

Strong calrs feet stock, 1 quart ; strained lemmi-juioe, short

Obs. — About seyen lan^ lemons will produce the half pint of 
juice. This quantity is for one mould only. The jelly will be 
found almost colourless unless much of the rinds be used, and 
as perfectly transparent as clear sfoing water : it is also yeiy 
agreeable m flayour. For yariety, part of the juice of the fruit 
might be omitted, and its place suppUed by maraschino, or any 
other ridi white liqueur of appropriate flayour.

and when this is dissolyed throw in four ounces of good sugar 
in lumps ; stir well, and simmer the whole for a few minutes, 
then mix with it four large wineglassesful of Ck>nstantia, and 
strain the jelly through a line cloth of close texture ; let it settle 
and cool, then pour it gently from any sediment there may be, 
into a mould wnich has been laid for an hour or two into water. 
We had this jelly made in the first instance for an invalid 
who' was forbidden to take adds, and it proved so agreeable in 
flavour that we can recommend it for the table. The isinglass, 
with an additional quarter ounce, might be clarified, and the 
sugar and orange-rind boiled with it anerwards. 

Water, 1 pint; rind J Seville orange: 5 minutes. Isinglass, 
1 oz. ; sugar, 4 ozs. : 5 to 7 minutes. Constantia, 4 large wine-

STBAWBEBRY ISINGLASS JELLT. 

A great variety of equally elegant and excellent jellies for 
the table may be made with clarified isinglass, clear syrup, and 
the juice of almost any kind of fresh fruit ; but as the process of 
making them is nearly the same for all, we shall limit our 
receipts to one or two, which will serve to direct the makers for 
the rest. Boil together quickly for fifteen minutes one pint of 
water and three quarters of a pound of very good sugar ; mear 
sure a quart of npe richly-flavoured strawberries without their 
stalks ; the scarlet answer best from the colour which thev ^ve; 
on these pour the boiling S3mip, and let them stand all night. 
The next day clarify two ounces and a half of isinglass in a pint 
of water, as directed at the beginning of this chapter ; drain the 
syrup from the strawberries very closely, add to it two or three 
tablespoonsful of red currant juice, and the clear juice of one 
large or of two small lemons ; and when the isinglass is nearly coM 
mix the whole, and put it into moulds. The French, who excel 
in these fruit-jellies, alwa3^ mix the separate ingredients when 
they are almost cold; and they also place them over ice for an 
hour or so after they are moulded, which is a great advantage, 
as they then require less isinglass, and are in consequence mucli 
more delicate. When the fruit aboimds, instead of throwing it 
into the syrup, bruise lightly firom three to four pints, throw 
two tablespoonsftil of sugar over it, and let the juice flow 
from it for an hour or two; then pour a little water over, 
and use the juice without boiling, which will give a jelly of 
finer flavour than the other.

^eeten, and of isin^iasa to stiffen it, with as much lemon-Juice 
as ivill bike off the msipidity of the flaTour, will serre for this 
kind of jelly. Pine-applea, peaches, and such other fruits a* 
do not yield much juice, must be infused in a larger quantity 
of syrup, which must then be used in lieu of it. In this sama

(Afi elegant summer diskJ) 

Throw into a pint of new milk the thin rind of a small 
lemon, and six or eight bitter almonds, blanched and^bruised; 
or sabstitute for these half a pod of vanilla, cut smaU,'lieiitit 
slowly by the side of the fire, and keep it at the point of boO- 
inff imtu it is strongly flavoured, then add a sonall pinch of 
flut, and three quarters of an ounce of the finest isinglass, or a 
full ounce should the weather be extremely warm ; when this 
is dissolved, strain the milk through a muslin, and put it into 
a dean saucepan, with four ounces and a half of sugar in 
luxtips, and half a pint of rich cream ; give the whole ope boil, 
and then stir it bnskly and by d^rees to the well-beaten yolks 
of six fresh eggs ; next, thicken the mixture as a custsurd, aver a 
gentle fire, but do not hazard its curdling; when it is of 
tolerable consistency, pour it out, and continue the stirring 
until it is half cold, then mix with it an ounce and a half of 
candied citron, cut in small spikes, and a couple of ounces of 
dried cherries, and pour it into a mould rubbed with a drop of 
oQ : when turned out it will have the appeanmccAf a puddrng- 
From two to three ounces of preserved ^ger,* well drained 
and sliced, may be substituted for the cherries, and an ounce 
of pistachio-nuts, blanched and split, for the citron ; these will • 
make an elegant variety of the dish, and the syrup of ^ ' 
ginger, pourea round as sauce, will be a further improvement 
Currants steamed until tender, md candied orange or lemon- 
rind, are often used instead of the cherries, and the veU- 
sweetened juice of strawberries, raspbenies (white or red), 
apricots, peaches, or syrup of pine-apple, 'vnll make an agree- 
able sauce ; a small quantity of this last will also five a delMions 
flavour to the pudding itself, when mixed with the otho'in^ 
gredients. Cream may be substituted entirely fi>r thermSlr 
when its richness is considered desirable.

Obs, — ^Tfae currants should be steamed in an earthen cul- 
kider, placed over a saucepan of boiling water, and covered 
with the lid. It will be a great impovement to place the

HSSSSUtODB CREAM. 

Shell and blanch (see page 333*) twenty-four fine Spanish 
chestnuts, and put them with three quarters of a pint of water 
into a small and ddicatdy dean saucepan. When they have 
ammered fin>m six to eight minutes, add to them two ounces of 
fine sugar, and let them stew yeiy gently until they are 
pedectly tender; then drain them from me water, pound 
tliem, while still warm, to a smooth paste, and press them 
tbrongh the beck of a fine sieve. While this is being done, 
dissolve half an ounce of iaing1a«» in two or three spoonsful of 
water, and put to it as much cream as will, with the small 
quantity of water used, make half a piut ; two ounces of su^gar, 
abont toe third of a pod of vanilla, cut small, and well bruised, 
and a strip or two of fresh lemon-rind, pared extremely thin. 
Give these a minute's boil, and then keep them^uite hot by the 
side of the fire, until a strons flavour of the vanilla is obtained, 
^ow, mix gradually with the chestnuts half a pint of rich, 
unboiled cream, strain the other half j«it through a fine 
musUn, and work the whole well together until it be^unes very 
thick ; then stir to it a couple of ounces of dried cherries, cut 
into quarters, and two of candied citron, divided into very 
small dice. Press the mixture into a mould which has been 
nibbed with a particle of the purest salad-oil, and in a few 
hoars it will be ready far table. The cream should be snfii- 
ciently stiff, when the fruit is added, to prevent its sinking to 
the bottom, and both kinds should be dry when they are used. 

Chestnuts, laig^ 24; watar, f pint; sugar, 2 ozs. ; isinglass, 
i oz.; water, 3 to 4 tablespoonsful ; cream, nearly j pint; 
vanilla, ) of pod ; lemon-rind, i of 1 lar^ : infuse 20 minutes 
or more. Imboiled cream, I pint; dried cherries, 2 ozs.; 
candied citron, 2 ozs. 

Obs, — ^When vanilla cannot easily be obtained, a little noyeau 
may be substituted for it, but a full weight of isinglass must 
then be used. Both this receipt and the foUovring one are 
entirely new, and our directions for them must be followed with 
^actness^ should the reader wkh to ensure their success.

CB^BfE X LA COMTESSE, 0& THE COUlfTESS^S CBEAM. 

Prepare as above, boil and pound eighteen fine sound cliest- 
nuts; mix with them gradually, after they have been pressed 
through a fine sieye, hsJf a pint of rich sweet cream ; dissolve in 
half a pint of new milk a n^-oimce of isinglass, then add to 
them from six to eight bitter almonds, blanched and bruised, 
with two thirds of the rind of a small lemon, cut extremely thin, 
and two ounces and a half of sugar ; let these simmer gently for 
five minutes, and then remain by the side of the fire for a while. 
When the niilk is stronsly flavoured, strain it through musUo, 
press the whole of it through, and stir it by degrees to the 
chestnuts and cream; beat the mixture smooth, and whoi it 
begins to thicken, put it into a mould rubbed with oil, or into 
one which has been dipped in water and shaken nearly free of 
the moisture. If set mto a cool place, it will be i:eady for 
table in six or eight hours. It has a pretty appearance when 
partially stuck with pistachio-nuts, blanched, dried, and cut in 
spikes, their bright ^een colour rendering them very orna- 
mental to dishes of this kind : as they are, however, much more 
expensive than almonds, they can be used more sparingly, or 
intermingled with spikes of the firm outer rind of candied 
dtron. 

Chestnuts, 18; water, full } pint; sugar, 1 oz. : 15 to 25 
minutes, or more. Cream, i pint ; new imlk, \ pint ; isinglass,

Obs. — This is a very delicate kind of sweet dish, which we 
can particularly recommend to our readers : it may be rendered 
more recherche by a flavouring of maraschino, but must then 
have a little addition of isinglass. The preparation, without 
this last ingredient, will be found exceUent iced. 

AN EXCELLENT TEIFLE. 

Take equal parts of wioe and brandy, about a wineglassfiil 
of each, or two thirds of good sherry or Madeira, and one of 
spirit, and soak in the mixture four sponge-biscuits, and half & 
pound of macaroons and ratifias; cover the bottom of the 
trifle-dish with part of these, and pour upon them a foil pint of 
rich boiled custard made with three quarters of a pmt, or 
rather more, of milk and cream taken m equal portions, and

and pile over the whole, to the depth of two or three mches, 
the whipped syllabub of page 446, previously well drained ; 
then sweeten and flavour slightly with wine only, less than 
half a pint of thin cream (or of cream and milk mixed) ;

SWISS CREAM, OR TRIFLE. 

{Veri/ goocL) 

Flavour pleasantly with lemon rind and cinnamon, a pint of 
rich cream, after having taken from it as much as will mix 
smoothly to a thin batter four teaspoonsful of the finest flour ; 
sweeten it with six ounces of well-refined sugar, in lumps; 
place it over a clear fire in a delicately clean saucepan, and 
when it boils stir in the flour, and simmer it for four or five 
minutes, stirring it gently without ceasing ; then pour it out, 
and when it is quite cold mix with it by degrees the strained 
juice of two moderate-sized and very fresh lemons. Take a 
quarter of a pound of macaroons, cover the bottom of a glass 
dish with a portion of them, pour in a part of the cream, lay 
the remainder of the macaroons upon it, add the rest of the 
cream, and ornament it with candied citron, sliced thin. It 
should be made the day before it is wanted for table. The 
rquisite flavour may be given to this dish by infusing in the 
cream the very thin rind of a lemon, and part of a stick oi 
cinnamon, slightly bruised, and then straining it before the 
flour is added ; or, these and the sugar may be boiled together, 
^th two or three spoonsful of water, to a strongly flavoured 
syrup, which, after having been passed through a niuslin 
strainer, may be stirred into the cream. Some cooks boil the 
tannamon and the grated rind of a lemon with all the other 
ingredients, but the cream has then to be pressed through a 
sieve after it is made, a process which it is always desirable to 
avoid.

^thout ceasing over a gentle fire until it has boiled softly from

supply the place of the water and lemon-juice. The creams are, 
we think, more delicate, though not qmte so thick, when the 
yolks only of six eggs are used for them. They will keep well 
for nearly a week in really cold weather.

Obs, — ^Lemon creams may, on occasion, be more ezpeditioiBly 
prepared, by racing tbe rind of the fruit upon the sugar wlna 
is used for them ; or, by paring it thin, and boiling it for a few 
minutes with the lemon-juice, sugar, and^water, \moit ihej are 
stirred to the eggs. 

FBUIT CREABIS, AND ITAUAN CB£AMS. 

These are very quickly and easily made, by mixing with good 
cream a sufficient proportion of tne sweetened juice of fresh 
fruit, or of well-made fruit jelly or jam, to flavour it: a few 
drops of prepared cochineal may be added to deepen the colour 
when it is required for any particular purpose. A quaiter-pint 
of strawberry or of raspberry jelly will fully flavour a pint of 
cream : a very little lemon-juice improves almost all composi- 
tions of this sort. When jam is used it must first be gradually 
mixed with the cream, and then worked through a sieve, to 
take out the seed or skhi of the fruit. All fresh juice, for tE^ 
purpose, must, of course, be cold; that of strawberries is best 
obtained by crushing the fruit and strewing sugar over it. 
Peaches, pine-apple, apricots, or nectarines, may be simmered 
for a few minutes in a little syrup, and this, dramed well from 
them, will serve extremely well to mix with the cream when it 
has become thoroughly cold : the lemon-juice should be added 
to all of these. When the ingredients are well blended, ligbtly 
whisk or mill them to a froth ; take this off with a skimmer as 
it rises, and lay it upon a fine sieve reversed, to drain, or if it is 
to be servediin glasses, fill them with it at once. 

Italian creams are either fruit-flavoured only, or mixed witli 
wine like syllabubs, then whisked to a stiff froth and put into a 
perforated mould, into which a muslin is first laid : or into a 
small hair-sieve (which must also first be lined with the muslin)) 
and left to drain until the following day, when the cream must 
be very gently turned out, and dished, and garnish^ as ^UMJ 
may direct. 

, VEBT SUPERIOR WHIPPED STULABUBS. 

Weigh seven ounces of fine sugar and rasp on it the rinds of 
two fresh sound lemons of good size, then pound or roll it io 
powder, and put it into a bowl with the strained juice of t^* 
lemons, two large glasses of sherry, and two of brandv; when 
the sugar is nearly or quite dissolved add a pint of ricii cream, 
and whisk or mill the mixture well ; take off the froth as it 



CHAP. XX.3 SWEET DISHES. 447 

Dfes, and put it into glasses.' These syllaliubs will remain 
good for several days, and should always be made if possible, 
iW and twen^ houre before they are wanted for table. The 
filU flavour of tne lemon-rind' is obtained with less trouble than 
in rasping, by paring it very thin indeed, and inftising it for 
Mme hours in the juice of the fruit.

shown Id the &i- 
fi»ving. Themun- 
ber required mnst depend on the size of the dish. From 
three to five pounds more must be stewed down into a smooth 
and diT marmalade, and with this all the gpaeea between them 
are to be filled 'up, and the whole are to be covered with it; an 
idt^ (^ two eggs, beaten to a veiy solid iroth, and mixed with two 
heaped tablespoonsful of simr, must then be spread evenly over 
the su^doise, fine su^ silted on this, and spikes of blanched 
almonds, cut lengthwise, stuck over the entire sur&ce ; the dish 
is then to be placed in a moderate oven until the almonds are 
browned, bat not too deeply, and the apples are hot throngh. 
It is not easy to give the required form with lesa than fifteen 
apples ; eight of these may aret be simmered in a syrup made 
with half a pint of water and six ounces of sugar, aad the 
remainder may be thrown m after these are lifted out. Care 
must be taken to keep them firm. The mannalade should be 
eweet, and pleasantly flavoured with lemon. 



Kmmer a pound of green gooseberries which have been freed 
irom the buds and stalkB, in three quarters of a pint of water, 
until they are well broken, tbeil strain them, and to half a 

Sound of the juice add half a pound of sugar, broken small : 
oil these together for fifteen mmutes, Dissolve half an ounce 
of isinglass m a quarter-pint of rich cream, pour them into a 
basin, and stir them till only lukewarm, then mix them by 
degrees with the sugar and gooseberry-juice, which should also 
have been allowed to cool ; add thestrainedjuiceof half asmall 
lemon, and mould the mixture, which should stand at least 
twelve hours, in a cool place before it is turned out. 

These proportions are sufficient for a small mould only, and 
most be doubled for a large one. The dish is too sweet for our ■ 
own taste, but as it has been highly approved by several persons 
who have tasted it, we give the receipt exactly as we had 
it tried in the first instance : it will be found extremely easy to 
varyit.

Throw into a pint and a half of new milk, the veiy thin rind 
of a firesh lemon, and let it infiise for half an honr, then simmer 
them together for a few minutes, and add four ounces and a 
half of white sugar. Beat thoroughly the yolks of fourteen 
fresh efljgs, mix with them another hsdf-pint of new milk, stir 
the hoilmg milk quickly to them, take out the lemon-peel, and 
turn the custard into a deep jug ; set this over the fire in a pan 
of hoiling water, and keep the custard stirred gently, but 
without ceasing, imtil it liegins to thicken; then move the 
spoon rather more quickly, making it always touch the bottom 
of the pug, imtil the mi^ure is hrought to the jwint of boilingi 
when it must he instantly taken from the fire, or it will curdle 
in a moment. Pour it into a howl, and keep it stirred ^ 
nearly cold, then add to it hy degrees a wineglassful of good 
hrandy, and two ounces of hlanched almonds, cut into spikes; 
or omit these, at pleasure. A few hitter ones, bruised, can be 
boiled in the milk in lieu of lemon-peel, when their flavour b 
preferred.

pan of water, pour it out, stir it till nearly cold, then add to it 
carefully, and by degrees, half a pint of rich cream, and last of 
all two tablespoonsful of strained lemon-juice. When the cur- 
lants are very ripe omit one ounce of the sugar. 

White currants and strawberries, cherries, red or white rasp- 
berries, or a mixture of any of these fruits, may be used for 
these custards with good efiect : they are excellent. 

Currant-juice, 1 pint ; sugar, 10 ozs. : 3 minutes. Eggs, 8 ;

QUINCE OB APPLE CUSTARDS. 

Add to a pint of apple-juice prepared as for jelly, a table- 
spoonful of strained lemon-juice, and from four tQ six ounces of 
sugar according to the aci(uty of the fruit ; stir these boiling, 
quickly, and in small portions, to eight well-beaten eggs, and 
thicken the custard in a jug placed in a pan of boiling water, in 
the usuad manner. A larger proportion of lemon-juice and a 
high flavouring of the rind can be given when approved. For 
quince custards, which if well made are excellent, observe the 
same directions as for the apple, but omit the lemon-juice. 'As 
we have before observed, all custards are much finer when made 
with the yolks only of the eggs, of which the number must be 
increased nearly half, when this is done. 

Prepared apple-juice (see page 427), 1 pint ; lemon-juicei 1 
tablespoonfril ; sugar, 4 to 6 ozs.; eggs, 8. Quince custards,

Obs. — In making lemon-creams the apple-juice may be sub- 
stituted very advantageously for water, without varying the 
receipt in other respects.

very superior custards of this kind.

over the top, and bake it in a very slow oven mmi twentymo 
thirty minutes, or longer, should itf not be firm in the centre. 
A custard, if well made, and properly baked, will be aof^ 
smooth when cut, without the honey-combed appearance which 
a hot oven gives; and there will be no wh^ in the dish.

brandy, or a little ratifia; finish and hake it hy the directions 
given for the common custard ahoTc; or pour it into small 
well-huttered cups, and hake it yeiy slowly from ten to twelve 
minutes. 

FBSNCH CV8TASDS. 

To a quart of new milk allow the yolks of twelve fresh eggs, 
but to equal parts of milk and cream of ten only. From six 
to eight ounces of sugar will sweeten the custard sufficiently 
for general taste, hut more can he added at will ; hoil this for 
a fev minutes gently in the milk with a grain or two of salt, 
and stir the mixture hriskly to the e^gs, as soon as it is taken 
from the fire. Butter a roimd deep di3i, pour in the custard, 
and place it in a pan of water at tne i>oint of hoUing, taking 
care that it shall not reach to within an inch of the e&e; let it 
just stnaner, and no more, from an hour to an hour and a half : 
whetn quite firm in the middle, it will he done. A very few 
live emhers should he kept on the lid of the stewpan to prevent 
the steam fiilling from it into the custard. Wnen none is at 
hand of a form to allow of this, it is Jbetter to use a charcoal 
fre, and to lay an oven-leaj^ or tin, over the pan, and the em- 
l)er8 in the centre. The small French furnace, shown in Chap* 
ter XXI., is exceedingly convenient for prq^mrations of tms 
kind; and there is always more or less of difficulty in keeping 
a coal fire entirely free from smoke for any length of tune. 
Sen^e the custard cold, with chopped macaroons, or ratifias, laid 
thickly round the edge so as to form a horder an inch deep. 
A few petals of fresh orange-hlossom infused in the milk, vml 
give it a most agreeahle flavour, very superior to that derived 
Irom the distilled water. Half a pod of vanilla, cut in short 
lengths, and well hruised, may he used instead of either ; hut 
the milk should then stand some time hy the fire hefore or after 
it boils, and it must he strained through a muslin hefore it is 
added to the eggs, as the small seed of the vanilla would pro- 
bably pass through a sieve. 

New DMlk, 1 quart ; yolks of eggs, 12 ; sugar, 6 to 8 ozs. Or, 
new milk, 1 pint ; cream, 1 pint ; yolks of eggs, 10 ; flavouring

coyer of a French stewpan with a weight upon it. Send the 
charlotte to a brisk oven for three quarters of an hour 
should it be small, and for an honr if large. Turn it out 
with great care, and serve it hot. If baked in a slack 
oven it will not take a proper degree of colour, and it will 
be liable to break in the dishm^. The strips of bread must of 
course join very perfectly, for if any spaces were left between 
them the syrup of the fruit would escape, and destroy the good 
appearance of the dish : should there not have been sufficient 
marmalade prepared to fill the mould entirely, a jar of quince 
or apricot jam, or of preserved cherries even, may be added to 
it with advantage. The butter should be well drained from the 
charlotte before it is taken from the mould ; and sugar may be 
sifted thickly over it before it is served, or it may be covered 
with any kind of clear red jelly. 

A more elegant, and we thiSak an easier mode of forming the 
crust, is to line the mould with small rounds of bread stamped 
out with a plain cake, or paste-cutter, then dipped in butter, and 
placed with the edges sufficiently one over the other to hold the 
firuit securely : the strips of hrevid are sometimes arranged in the 
same way. 

f to 1 hour, quick oven. 

MARMALADE FOB THE CHABLOTTE. 

Weigh three pounds of good boiling apples, after they have 
been pared, cored, and quartered; put them into a stewpan with 
six ounces of fresh butter, three quarters of a pound of sugar 
beaten to powder, three quarters of a teaspoonml of pounded 
cinnamon, and the strained juice of a lemon : let these stew 
over a gentle fire, until they form a perfectly smooth and dry 
mmnalade ; keep them often stirred that they may not bum, 
and let them cool before they are put into the crust. This 
quantity is for a moderate-sized charlotte.

Cut horizontally into half-inch dices a Savoy or sponge cake, 
and cover each slice with a different kind of preserve ; replace 
them in their original form, and spread equally over the cake an 
icing made with the whites of three eggs, and four oimces of 
the finest pounded sugar ; sift more sugar over it in every part, 
and put it into a very slack oven to dry. The eggs should be 
whisked to snow before they are used. One kind of {>reserve, 
instead of sev^al can be used for this dish ; and a lice or a

(Buttered apolu, Excdlent.) 
Fare six or eight fine apples of a firm kind, but of t good 
eookii^ sort, and core without pierdiig them througb, or 
dividing them ; fill the cavities with fresh butter, put a q1l8rte^ 
pound more cut small into a stewpan just large enough to con- 
tain tibe apples in a siii^le layer, place them closely together on 
it, and stc^ them as somy oaposstble, turmng them oocasioiuilly 
until they are almost sufficiently tender to serve ; then fltrev 
upon them as much sifted sugar as will sweeten the dish hi^^i 
and a teaspoonful of pounded cinnamon ; shake these wdl m 
and upon the fruit, and stew it for a &w minutes longer. Lift 
it out, arrange it in a hot dish, put into each apple as macii 
warm apricot jam as it will contain, and lay a small quantity oa 
the top ; pour the syrup from the pan round but not on the trwiy 
and serve it immediately. 

Apples, 6 to 8 ; fresh butter, 4 ozs., just simmered till tender. 
Sugar, 6 to 8 .ozs. ; cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful : 5 minutes. Apn*

d6«.^— Particular care must be taken to keep the apples entire; 
they should rather steam in a |;entle heat than botl. It is^' 
possible to specify the precise tune which will render them ^' 
denthr tender, as this must depend greatly on the time of yetf 
andthesort of fruit. If the stewpan were placed in a vay slow 
oven, the more r^nlar heat of it would perhaps be better ini^ 
effect than the striving.

it boil until it is dry and tender, and when it is nearH" so, stir 
to it two ounces of blanched and pounded ahnonds. Turn the 
rice, when done, into shallow dishes, or soup-plates, and shake 
it until the surface is smooth ; then sift over it, rather thickly, 
through a muslin, some freshly-powdered cinnamon, which will 
give it the appearance of a baked pudding. Serve it cold. 
It will remain good for several days. This is quite the best 
sweet preparation of rice that we have ever eaten, and it is a yerj 
&yourite dish in Portugal, whence the recdpt was derived. One 
or two bitter almonds, poimded with the sweet ones, might & 
little improve its flavour, and a few spoonsM of rich cream could 
occasionally be substituted for a small portion of the milk, hut 
it should not be added until the preparation is three parts 
done.

hour, or more. Pounded almonds, 2 028.; cinnamon, 1 tea-

06*. — ^The rice must be frequently stirred while boiling, par- 
ticularly after it begins to thicken ; and it will be better not to 
add the entire quantity of milk at first, as from a quarter to half 
a pint less will sometimes prove sufficient. The grain should be 
thoroughly tender, but d^ and unbroken.

out their stalks, and when they are quite warmed through, 
strew in amongst them four ounces of sugar, and keep the whole 
well turned over a moderate fire ; pour in ^raduall^ half a pint 
of hot water, and in fifteen minutes the cherries will be tender.

cherries stewed from five to seven minutes, in syrup (made by 

boiline five ounces of sugar in half a pint of water, for a quarter 

of an hour), and poured hot on the fried bread. Two pounds 

of the fruit, when it is stoned, will be required for a fufi-sized

yolks of three lai^ge, or of four small eggs, shake them round 
briskly over the fire till they thicken, pour them over the 
maccaroni and serve it immediately ; or instead of the eggs, heat 
and sweeten some very rich cream, pour it on the drained 
maccaroni, and dust finely-powdered cinnamon over through a 
muslin, or strew it thickly, with crushed macaroons. For 
variety, cover it wilh the German sauce of page 126, milled to 
a light &oth. 

New nulk, li pint ; pipe maccaroni, 4 ozs. ; strips of lemon- 
rind or cinnamon ; sugar, 2 to 3 ozs. ; i to 1 hour or more. 

BEBMUPA WITCHES. 

Slice equally some rice, pound, or Savoy cake, not more than 
the sixth of an inch thick ; take off the brown edges, and spread 
one half of it with Guava jelly, or, if more convenient, with fine 
strawberry, raspberrv, or currant jeUy of the best quality (see 
Norman receipt, 478; ; on this strew thickly some fresh cocoa- 
nut grated small, and lightly ; press over it the remainder of the 
cake, and trim the whole into good form ; divide the slices if 
large, pile them slopingly in the centre of a dish upon a very 
white napkin folded flat, and garnish or intersperse them wita 
small sprigs of myrtle. For very young people a French roll 
or two, and good currant jelly, red or white, will supply a 
wholesome and inexpensive dish. 

NEBSELKODE PUDDING. 

We give Monsieur Car^me^sown receipt for this &vourite and 
fashionable dish, not having ourselves had a good opportunity of 
proving it ; but as it originated with him he is the best autho- 
rity for it. It may be varied in many ways, which the taste or 
ingenuity of the reader will easily suggest. Boil forty fine 
sound Spanish chestnuts qtiite tender in plenty of water, take 
off the husks, and pound the chestnuts perfectly with a few 
spoonsful of syrup ; rub them through a fine sieve, and mix

VERY GOOD OI<D-FASEIONED BOILED CU8TABD. 

Throw into a pint and a half of new milk, the yer^ thin rind 
of a fresh lemon, and let it infuse for half an hour, then simmer 
them together for a few minutes, and add four ounces and a 
half of white sugar. Beat thoroughly the yolks of fourteen 
fresh eggs, mix with them another nsiif-pint of new milk, stir 
the houmg milk quickly to them, take out the lemon-peel, and 
turn the custard into a deep jug ; set this over the fire in a pan 
of hoiling water, and keep the custard stirred gently, but 
without ceasing, until it begins to thicken; then move the 
spoon rather more quickly, making it always touch the bottom 
of the pug, imtil the mi^ure is brought to the point of boiling, 
when it must be instantly taken from the fire, or it will curdle 
in a moment. Pour it into a bowl, and keep it stirred until 
nearly cold, then add to it by degrees a wineglassful of good 
brandy, and two ounces of blanched almonds, cut into spikes; 
or omit these, at pleasure. A few bitter ones, bruised, can be 
boiled in the milk in lieu of lemon-peel, when their flavour is 
preferred. 

]^ew milk, 1 quart; rind of 1 lemon; sugar, 4^ ozs.; yolks 
^^cggs, 14; salt, ^ saltspoonfal. 

BICH BOILED CUSTABD. 

Take a small cupful from a quart of fresh cream, and ammer 
the remainder for a few minutes with four ounces of sugar and 
the rind of a lemon, or give it any other flavour that may be 
preferred. Beat and strain the yolks of eight egp, mix diem 
with the cupfiil of cream, and stir the rest boSmg to them: 
thicken the custard like the preceding one. 

Cream, 1 quart ; sugar, 4 ozs. ; yolks of eggs, 8. 

THE queen's custard.' 

On the beateii and strained yolks of twelve new laid cgss 
^ur a pint and a half of boiling cream which has been sweetened 
with three ounces of sugar ; add the smallest pinch of salt, and 
thicken the custard as usual. When nearly cold, flavonr it 
with a glass and a half of noyeau, maraschino, or cuirasseau; add 
the sliced almonds or not, at pleasure. 

Yolks of eggs, 12 ; cream, 1^ pint ; sugar, 3 oas. ; little salt; 
noyeau, maraschino, or cuirasseau, 1 j win^lassful. 

CUBBANT CUSTABD. 

Boil in a pint of clear currant juice ten ounces of sugar for

three minutes, take off the scum, and pour the boiling juice on 
eight well-beaten e^ ; thicken the custard in a jug set into a 
pan of water, pour it out, stir it till nearly cold, then add to it 
carefidly, and by degrees, half a pint of rich cream, and last of 
all two tablespoonsful of strained lemon-juice. When the cur- 
rants are veiy ripe omit one oimce of the sugar. 

White currants and strawberries, cherries, red or white raro- 
berries, or a miicture of any of these fruits, may be used ror 
these custards with good efiect : they are excellent. 

Currant-juice, 1 pint; sugar, 10 ozs.: 3 minutes. Eggs, 8; 
cream, | pint ; lemon-juice, 2 tablespoonsful. 

QUINCE OB APPLE CUSTARDS. 

Add to a pint of apple-juice prepared as for jelly, a table- 
spoonful of strained lemon-juice, and from four tQ six ounces of 
sugar according to the aci(uty of the fruit ; stir these boiling, 
quickly, and in small portions, to eight well-beaten eggs, and 
thidLen the custard in a jug placed in a pan of boiling water, in 
the usual manner. A larger proportion of lemon-juice and a 
high flaTOuring of the rind can be given when approved. For 
quince custards, which if well made are excellent, observe the 
same directions as for the apple, but omit the lemon-juice. As 
we have before observed, all custards are much finer when made 
ifdth the yolks only of the eggs, of which the number must be 
increased nearly half, when this is done. 

Prepared apple-juice (see page 427), 1 pint ; lemon-juice, 1 
tablespoonfrd ; sugar, 4 to 6 ozs.; eggs, 8. Quince custards, 
same proportions, but no lemon-juice. 

Obs. — -In making lemon-creams the apple-juice may be sub- 
stituted verv advantageously for water, without varying the 
receipt in other respects. 

THE duke's CUSTABD. 

Drain well from their juice, and then roll in dry si^d sugar, 
as many fine brandied Morella cherries as will cover thickly the 
bottom of the dish in which this is to be sent to table ; arrange 
them in it, and pour over them from a pint to a pint and a half 
of rich cold boiled custard ; garnish the edge with macaroons or 
Naples* biscuits, or pile upon the custard some solid rose-coloured 
whipped cream, highly flavoured with brandy. 

Brandied MoreUa cherries, J to whole pint ; boiled custard, 
from 1 to 1} pint ; thick cream, } pint or more ; brandy, 1 to 2

which the receipts ate giTen in thia chapter, as well as for 
Tarions disheB contained in the body of the work. There 
should always be a free current of air in the roost in which it 
stands when lighted, as charcoal or braise (that is to say, the 
little embers of large well-bumed wood, drawn from an oven, 
and shut immediately into a 
closely-stopped iron or cop- 
per vessel to eitinguish 
them) is the only fuel suited 
to it. To kindle either of 
these, two or three bits must 
be lighted in a common fire, 
and laid on the top of that 
in the furnace, which should 
be evenly placed between the 
gratin? and the brim, and 
ttlen blown gently with the 
bellows until the whole is 
alight: the door of the fur- 
nace nlust in the mean while 
be open, and remain so, un- 
less the beat should at any 
time be too fierce for the 
preserves, when it must be 
closed for a few minutes, to 
moderate it. To extinguish 
the fire altogether, the cover 
] must be pressed closely on, 
and the door be quite shut : 
the embers which remain wiil

The German enamelled stewpang, now coming into general 
nse, are, from the peculiar nicely of the composition with 
which they are lined, better adapted than any others to 
pickling and preserving, as they may be used without dan- 

Sr for acids i and red fruits, when boiled in them, retain 
e lirightnesB of their colour as well as if copper or bell- 
meta! were used for them. The form of the old-fashioned pre- 
serving pan, made usually of one or the other of these, is shown 
above ; but it has not, we should say, even the advantage of

being of convenient shape; for 
the handles quickly become 
heated, and the pan, in conse- 
quence, cannot always be instan- 
taneously raised from the fire 
when the contents threaten to 
over-boil, or to bum. 
It is desirable to have three 

Copper PreaerYing Pan. OT four WOOden SpOOnS Or 

Spatulas, one fine hair-sieve, at the least, one or two large 
squares of common muslin, and a strainer, or more of closer 
texture, kept exclusively for preparations of fruit, for if used 
for other purposes, there is the hazard, without great care, of 
their retaining some strong or coarse flavour, which they 
would impart to the preserves. A sieve, for example, throum 
which any preparation of onions has been poured, should 
never, on any account, be brought into use for any kind of 
confectionary, nor in making sweet dishes, nor for straining 
eggs or milk for pudc^gs, cakes, or bread. Damp is the 
great enemy, not only of preserves and pickles, but of num- 
berless other household stores ; yet, in many situations, it is 
extremely difficult to exclude it. To keep them in a '' dry 
cool place" (words which occur so frequently both in this 
book, and in most others on the same subject^ is more easily 
directed (than done. They remain, we find, more entirelv 
free from any danger of mouldii^g, when covered with "a 
brandied paper only, and placed on the shelves of a tolerably 
dry store-room; bat they are rather liable to candjr when 
thus kept, and we &ncy that the flavour of the fruit is some- 
what less perfectly preserved than when the^ are quite 
secured from the air by duns stretched over the jars. If left; 
uncovered, the inroads of mice npon them must be yarded 
against, as they will commit great havoc in a single ni^ht on 
these sweet stores. When the slightest fermentation is per- 
ceptible in syrup, it should immediately be boiled for some 
minates, and well skimmed ; the fruit taken from it should 
then be thrown in, and well scalded also, and the whole, 
when done, should be turned into a very clean dry jar : this 
kind of preserve should always be covered with one or two 
skins, or with parchment and thick paper. 

A FEW GENERAL RULES AND DIRECTIONS FOR PRESERVING. 

1 . Let everything used for the purpose be delicately clean 
and dry ; bottles especially so. 

H H 



466 MODERN COOKERY. QcHAP. XXI. 

2. Never place a preserving panyfa/ upon the fire, as this 
-will render tne preserve liable to oum to, as it is called ; that 
is to say, to adhere closely to the metal, and then to bum ; it 
should rest always on a trevet (that shown with the French 
furnace is very convenient, even for a common grate), or on 
the lowered bar of the kitchen range. 

3. After the sugar is added to them, stir the preserves 
gently at first, and more quickly towards the end, without 
quitting them until they are done; this precaution will 
idways prevent the chance of their being spoiled. 

4. All preserves should be perfectly cleared from the scum 
as it rises. 

5. Fruit which is to be preserved in syrup must first be 
blanched or boiled gently, until it is sufficiently softened to 
absorb the sugar; and a thin syrup must be poured on it at 
first, or it will shrivel instead of remaining plump, and be- 
coming clear. Thus, if its weight of sugar is to be allowed, 
and boiled to a syrup with a pint of water to the pound, only 
half the weight must be taken at first, and this must not be 
boiled with tne water more than fifteen or twenty minutes at 
the commencement of the process ; a parif of the remaining 
sugar must be added every time the syrup is reboiled, unless 
it snould be otherwise directed in the receipt. 

6. To preserve both the true flavour and the colour of firuit 
in jams and jellies, boil them rapidly until they are well re- 
duced, be/ore the sugar is added, and quickly afterwards, but 
do not allow them to become so much thickened that the 
sugar will not dissolve in them easily, and throw up its scum. 
In some seasons, the juice is so much richer than in otheis, 
that this efiect takes place almost before one is aware of it ; 
but the drop which adneres to the skimmer, when it is held 
up, will show the state it has reached. 

7. Never use tin, iron, or pewter spoons, or skimmers foi 
preserves, as they will convert the colour of red fruit into a 
dingy purple, and impart, besides, a very unpleasant flavour. 

8. When cheap jams or jellies are required, make them at 
onjce with Lisbon su^ar, but use that which is well refirtei 
always, for preserves m general ; it is a false economy, as we 
have elsewhere observed, to purchase an inferior kind, a« 
there is great waste from it in the quantity of scum which 
it throws up. The best has been used for all the receipts 
given here. 



CRAF. XX^3 PRESERVES. 467 

iST '" TO EXTRACT THE JUICE OF PLUMS FOR JELLY, 

Take the stalks from the fruit, and throw aside all that is 
not perfectly sound ; put it into very clean, large stone jars, . 
and give part of the harder kinds, such as hullaces and dam- 
sons, a gash with a knife as they are thrown in ; do this 
especially in filling the upper part of the jars. Tie one or 
two folds of thick paper over them, and set them for the 
night into an oven from which the bread has been drawn . 
four or five hours; or covqt them with bladder, instead of 
paper, place them in deep pans of water, and boil them gently 
from two to three hours, or until the fruit is quite soft, and 
bas yielded all the juice it will afford : this last is the safer 
and better mode for jellies of delicate colour. 

TO WEIGH THE JUICE OF FRUIT. 

Put a basin into one scale, and its weight into the other ; 
add to this last the weight which is reauired of the juice, and 
pour into the basin as much as will balance the scales. It is 
always better to weigh than to measure the juice for pre- 
serving, as it can generally be done with more exactness. 

GREEN GOOSEBERRY JELLY. 

Wash some freshly gathered gooseberries very clean, after 
baving taken off the tops and stalks, then to each pound, nour 
three quarters of a pint of spring water and simmer tnem 
nntil they are well broken ; turn the whole into a jelly-bag 
or cloth, and let all the juice drain through ; weigh, and boil 
it rapidly for fifteen minutes. Draw it from the fire, and stir 
Mto it until entirely dissolved an equal weight of good sugar 
reduced to powder; boil the jelly from fifteen to twenty 
ininutes longer, or until it jellies strongly on the spoon or 
skimmer; clear it perfectly from scum, and pour it into small 
jars, moulds, or glasses. It ought to be very pale and trans- 
parent. Preserved fruits just dipped into hot water to take 
off the syrup, then well drained and dried, may be arranged 
with good effect in the centre of the gooseberry jelly if the 
glasses be rather less than half filled before they are laid in, 
and the jelly just set : the remainder must be kept liquid to 
nil them up. The sugar may be added to the juice at first, 
and the preserve boiled from twenty-five to thirty- five minutes, 
out the colour yd\l not then be so good. When the fruit 
abounds the juice may be drawn from it with very little water.

as directed for apples, page 491, when it will require much 
less boiling. 

Gooseberries, 6 lbs. ; water, 4 pints : 20 to 30 minates. 
Juice boiled quickly, 15 minutes ; to each pound, 1 lb. sugar : 
15 to 20 minutes. 

OREEN GOOSEBERRT JAM. 

I {Firm and of good colour,) 

Cut the stalks and tops from the fruit, wei^h and bruise it 
slightly, boil it for six or seveif minutes, keeping it well 
turned during the time ; then to every three pounds of goose- 
berries add two and a half of sugar beaten to powder, and 
boil the preserve quickly for three quarters of an hour. It 
must be constantly stirred, and carefully cleared from scum. 

Green gooseberries, 6 lbs. : 6 to 7 minutes. Sugar 5 lbs. : 
} hour. 

TO DRY GREEN GOOSEBERRIES. 

Take the finest green gooseberries, fully grown, and freshly 
gathered ; cut off the buds, snlit them across the tops haH 
way down, and with the small end of a tea or of an egg 
spoon, scoop out the seeds. Boil together for fifteen minutes 
a pound and a half of the finest susar, and a pint of water; 
skun this syrup thoroughly and throw into it a pound of 
the seeded gooseberries; smimer them from five to seven 
minutes, when they ought to be clear and tender ; when they 
are so lift them out, and throw as manv more into the syrup; 
drain them a little when done, spread tnem singly on dishes, 
and dry them veri/ gradually in a quite cool stove or oven, or 
in a sunny window. They will keep well in the symp, and 
may be potted in it, and dried when wanted for use. 

Green gooseberries without the seeds, 2 lbs. ; water, 1 pint; 
sugar, li lb. : boiled 15 minutes. Gooseberries simmered, 5 
to 7 minutes. 

OREEN GOOSEBERRIES FOR TARTS. 

Fill very clean, dry, wide-necked bottles with gooseberries 
gathered the same day, and before they have attained their 
full growth. Cork them lightly, wrap a little hay round each 
of them, and set them up to their nec)cs in a copper of cold 
water which should be brought very gradually to boil. Let 
the fruit be gently simmered until it appears shrunken and 
perfectly scalded; then take out the bottles, and with the 
contents of one or two fill up the remainder, emd use great 



CHAP. XXIb2 prbsbbtss. 469 

care not to break the firuit in doing this. When all are ready 
pour seaMmg water into the bottles and cover die gooseberries 
entirely witn it» or the^ will become mouldy at the top. Cork 
the bottles well immediately, and cover the necks with melted 
rosin; keep them in a cool place; and when they are used 
pour off the greater part of the water, and add sugar as for 
the fresh fruit, of which they will have quite the flavour and 
appearance ; and they will be found much more wholesome 
prepared in this manner than if simply baked or steamed in 
the bottles. 

OREEN GOOSEBERRT SOLID. 

Bruise well, and boil six ^unds of fresh green gooseberries 
for an hour and a quarter without sugar, and for half an hour 
after having stirred to them a couple of pounds of ^ood 
quality, reduced quite to powder. Press tne preserve mto 
snallow pans or small shapes, and unmould it when it is 
vranted for table. 

Green gooseberries, 6 lbs.: \\ hour* Sugar, 2 lbs. : \ hour. 

RED OOOSEBERRT JAM. 

The small rough red gooseberry, when fully ripe, is the 
best for this preserve, which may, however, be made of the 
larger kinds. Y^en the budsi and stalks have been taken 
caiefuUy from the fruit, weigh, and boil it quickly for three 
quarters of an hour, keeping it well stirred; then for six 
pounds of the goosebemes add two and a half of good 
roughly-powderA sugar (or three of fine Lisbon, if only a 
common preserve be wanted) ; boil these together briskly, 
from twenty to twenty-five minutes, and stir the jam well 
from the bottom of the pan, as it is liable to bum if this be 
neglected. 

Small red gooseberries, 6 lbs.: i hour. Pounded sugar, 
l^lbs. (for common jam Lisbon sugar 3 lbs.): 20 to 25 
minutes. 

VERT FINE GOOSEBERRY JAM. 

Seed the fruit, which for this jam may be of the larger 
kind of rough red gooseberry: those which are smooth- 
skinned are generally of far inferior flavour. Add the pulp 
which has been scooped from the prepared fruit to some 
whole gooseberries, and stir them over a moderate fire for 
some minutes to extract the juice; strain and wei^h this; 
pour two pounds of it to four of the seeded gooseberries, boil 



470 MODERN COOE&RT. ^GHAP. XH* 

them rather gently for twenty-five minates, add fourteen 
ounces of good pounded sugar to each pound of fruit and 
juice, and when it is dissolved boil the preserve from twelve 
to fifteen minutes longer, and skim it well during the time. 

Seeded gooseberries, 4 lbs. ; juice of gooseberries, 21b6. : 
25 minutes. Sugar, 5) lbs. (or 14 ozs. to each pound fruit and 
juice) : 12 to 15 minutes. 

JELLY OF RIPE GOOSEBERRIES. 

{ExcdlenL) 

Take the tops and stalks from a gallon or more of any kind 
of well-flavoured ripe red gooseberries, and keep them stined 1 
gently over a clear fire until they have yielded all their juice, 
which should then be poured off without pressing the fruit, 
sxid passed first through a fine sieve, and afterwards through 
A double muslin-strainer, or a jelly ba^.* Next weigh it, and 
to every three pounds add one or white currant-juice, which 
has previously been prepared in the same way ; boil these 
quickly for a quarter -of an hour, then draw them from the 
fire and stir to them half their weight of good sugar; when 
this is dissolved boil the jelly for six minutes longer, skim it 
thoroughly, and pour it into jars or moulds. If a very large 
•quantity be made, a few minutes of additional boiling must 
be given to it be/ore the sugar is added. 

Juice of red gooseberries, 3 lbs. ; juice of white cunants, 
1 lb. : 15 minutes. Sugar, 2 lbs. : 6 minutes. 

Obs. — The same proportion of red currant-juice, mixed 
with that of the gooseberries makes an exceedingly nice jellf. 

UNMIXED GOOSEBERRY JELLY. 

Boil rabidly for ten minutes four pounds of the juice of red 

f[oosebernes, prepared as in the preceding receipt ; take it 
rom the fire, and stir in it until dissolvea three pounds of 
sugar beaten to powder *, boil it again for five minutes, keep- 
ing it constantly stirred and thoroughly skimmed. 

Juice of red gooseberries, 4 lbs. : 10 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 
5 minutes. 

GOOSEBERRY PASTE. 

Press through a sieve the gooseberries from which tij 
juice has been taken for jelly, without having been di«fic4 
very closely from them ; weigh and then bou the pdp fo^ 
upwards of an hour and a quarter, or until it forms a dry 
paste m the pan j stir to it, off the fire, six ounces ol good 



CHAP. XXI.3 PRESERVES. 471 

pounded sugar for each pound of the fruit; and when this is 
nearly dissolved boil the preserve from twenty to twenty-five 
minutes, keeping it stirred without cessation, as it will be 
liable to bum should this be neglected. Put it into moulds, 
or shallow pans, and turn it out when wanted for table. 

Pulp of gooseberries, 4 lbs. : U to Ij hour. Sugar, IJ lb. : 
20 to 25 minutes. 

TO DRY RIPE GOOSEBERRIES WITH SUGAR. 

Cut the tops, but not the stalks, from some ripe goose- 
berries of the hurgest size, either red or green ones, and after 
having taken out the seeds as directed for unripe goose- 
berries, boil the fruit until clear and tender in syrup made 
with a pound of sugar to the pint of water boiled until rather 
thick. 

Seeded gooseberries, 2 lbs.; sugar, Ijlb. ; water, I pint: 
boiled to syrup. Gooseberries, simmered 8 to 12 minutes, or 
more. 

Obs, — Large ripe gooseberries stripped of their buds, and 
put into cold syrup in which cherries or any other fruit has 
been boiled for drying, then heated very gradually, and kept 
at the point of boiline for a few minutes before they are set 
by for a couple of days, answer extremely well as a dry 
preserve. On the third day the syrup should be drained from 
them, simmered, skimmed, and poured on them the instant it 
is taken from the fire ; in forty-eight hours after, they may be 
drained from it and laid singly upon plates or dishes, and 
placed in a gentle stove or oven. 

GOOSEBERRIES DRIED WITHOUT SUGAR. 

Choose them fine and ripe, spread them separately on large 
dishes, and dry them very gradually by the heat of a gentle 
oven, or in the sun where they will be well protected from 
dust. If flattened with the finger when partially done, they 
will preserve a better form, and be more quickly dried. 

CHERRY JAM. 

First stone, and then weigh some freshly gathered Kentish 
or Flemish cherries ; boil them over a brisk fire for an hour, 
keeping them almost constantly stirred from the bottom of 
the pan, to which they will otherwise be liable to stick and 
bum. Add half a pound of good sugar roughly powdered for 
each pound of the fruit, and boil the preserve quickly for 
twenty minutes, taking off the scum as it rises. The blanched 



472 MODEBN OOOKKRY* f CHAP. XXL 

kemels of part of the cherries may be added to the jam fife 
minutes before it is taken from the fire. We can recommend 
this receipt as producing a firm preserve of fine colour and 
flavour, and very far superior to any that can be made by the 
more common method of boiling the fruit and sugar together 
from the beginning. 

Stoned cherries, 6 lbs.: 1 hour. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 20 
minutes. 

Obs, — Increase the proportion of sugar, when it is liked, to 
twelve or sixteen ounces, and diminish the boiling a iqoarter 
of an hour before it is added, and ten minutes after. We 
have found almost invariably, that preserves made by the 
receipts we have given have been preferred to richer ones. 

TO DRY CHERRIES WITH SUGAR. 

(A quick and easy method,) 
Stone some fine, sound, Kentish or Flemish cherries; 
weigh and put them into a preserving pan, with sixoiuicesof 
sugar reduced to powder to each pound of the fruit : set them 
over a moderate fire, and simmer them gently for iiearlyor 
quite twenty minutes ; let them remain in the syrup untiinMy 
are a little cooled, then turn them into a sieve, and hefbie 
they are cold lay them sihgly on dishes, and dry them reiy 
gradually, as directed for other fruits. When the cherries are 
quite ripe the stones may generally be drawn out with the 
stalks, by pressing the fruit gently at the same time; but 
when this meth<^ foils, they must be extracted with a ner 
quill, cut round at the end ; those of the very short-stalked, 
turnip-shaped cherry, which abounds, and is remarkably fin^ 
in many parts of Normandy, and which we have occasionally 
met with here, though it is not, we believe, very abundait in 
our markets, are easily removed with a large pin, on the point 
of which the stone may be caught at the stalk end, jost op- 
posite the seam of the fruit, and drawn out at the top, leaving 
the cherry appaifently entire.

xeceipts. Keep them in tin cases, or oanisten, when done. 
These cherries are generally, preferred to sach as are dried 
with a larger proportion of sugar; but when the taste is in 
fayour of the latter, three quarters or a full pound can be 
allowed to the pound of fruit, which may then be potted in 
the syrup and dried at any time, though we tiunk the flayour 
of the cherries is better preserved when this is done within a

or 3 days. Boiled again, 10 minutes; left 2 days ; drained 
and dried. 

CHERRIES DRIED WITHOtTT SUOAR. 

These are often more pleasant and refreshing to inyalids 
and travellers than a sweetened confection of the fruit, their 
flavour and agreeable acidity being well preserved when they 
are simply spread on dishes or hamper-lids, and slowly dried.* 
Throw aside the bruised and decayed fruit, and arrange the 
remainder singly, and with the stalks uppermost on the dishes. 
The Kentish cherries are best for the purpose, but Morellas 
also answer for it excellently. The K)rmer are sometimes 
stoned, and simmered until quite tender in their own juice, 
before they are dried ; but this is scarcely an improvement on 
the more usual method of leaving them entire. 

MORELLA CHERRIES. 

Take off the stalks but do not stone the fruit ; weigh and 
add to it an equal quantity of the best sugar reduced quite to 
powder, strew it over the cherries and let them stand for half 
an hour, then turn them gently into a preserving-pan, and 
simmer them softly from five to seven minutes. 

COMMON CHERRY CHEESE. 

Stone the fru\t, or if this trouble be objected to, bruise and 
boil it without, until it is sufficiently tender to press through 
a sieve, which it will be in from twenty to thirty minutes. 
Weigh the pulp in this case^ and boil it quickly to a dry paste^ 
then stir to it six ounces ai sugar for the pound of fruit, and 
when this is dissolved, place the pan again over, but not ufoUf 
a brisk fire, and stir the preserve without ceasing, until it is 
so dry as not to adhere to the finder when touched; then press 
it immei^ately into small moulds or pans, and turn it from 
them when wanted for table. When the cherries have been

stoned, a good common preserve may be made of them with- 
out passing them through a sieve, with the addition of fire 
ounces of suear to the pound of fruit, which must be boiled 
▼erv dry both before and after it is added. 

Kentish or Flemish cherries without stoning : 20 to 30 
minutes. Passed through a sieve. To each pound of palp 
(first boiled dry), 6 ozs. sugar. To each pound of cherries 
stoned and boiled to dry paste, 5 ozs. sugar. 

CHERRY PASTE. (FRENCH.) 

Stone the cherries, boil them gently in their own juice for 
thirty minutes ; press the whole through a sieve ; reduce it to 
a very dry paste ; then take it from the fire, and weigh it; boil 
an equal proportion of sugar to the candpng point, mix the 
fruit with it, and stir the paste, without intermission, over a 
moderate fire, until it is again so dry as to form a ball round 
the spoon, and to quit the preserving-pan entirely ; press it 
quickly into small moulds, and when it is cold, paper, and 
store it like other preserves. 

STRAWBERRY JAM. 

Strip the stalks from some fine scarlet strawberries, weigb, 
and boil them for thirty-five minutes, keeping them very con- 
stantly stirred ; throw in eight ounces of good sugar, beaten 
small, to the pound of fruit, mix them well off the fire, then 
boil the preserve again quickly for twenty-five minutes. One 
pound of white currant-juice added in the first instance to four 
of the strawberries, will greatly improve this preserve, which 
will be quite firm, and sufficiently, but not over sweet 

Strawberries, 6 lbs. : 35 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 25 minutes. 
Or : strawberries, 4 lbs. ; currant-juice, lib. : 30 to 35 minutes. 
Sugar, 2i lbs. : 25 minutes. 

Obs. — ^We do not think it needful to give directions with 
each separate receipt for skimming the preserve with care, 
and keeping it constantly stirred, but neither should in anj 
case be neglected. 

STRAWBERRY JELLY. 

This, when made with fine, full-flavoured, scarlet straw- 
berries, is a very delicious preserve, and is by many peis^J 
preferred to guava jelly, which it greatly resembles. Sta* 
the fruit, bruise it very slightly, and stir it for a few minuttt

or preserving-pan, if possible, that the colour may not be in- 
jured ; take it from the fire, and stir into it twelve ounces of 
sugar to the pound of juice ; when this is dissolved; boil it 
again quickly for twenty minutes, clear it perfectly from scum, 
and pour it into jars or glasses. The preserve will be firmer, 
and require less boiling, if one-fourth of red or white currant 
juice be mized with that of the strawberries, but the flavour 
will not then be quite so perfect. A superior jelly to this is 
made by taking an equal weight of juice and sugar, and by 
boiling the latter to candy-height, before the juice (which 
should previously be boiled five minutes) is added to it ; and 
when they have been stirred together oflf the fire until this is 
entirely dissolved, boiling the whole quickly from ten to 
twenty minutes ; the time required varying very much from 
the difference which is found in the quality of tne fruit. 

Fruit, simmered 4 to 5 minutes. Juice of strawberries, 4 lbs. : 
20 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 20 minutes. Or, juice of strawberries, 
4 lbs. : 5 minutes. Sugar, boiled to candy height, 4 lbs. : 10 to 
20 minutes. 

ANOTHER VERY FINE STRAWBERRY JELLY. 

Express the juice from the fruit through a cloth, strain it 
clear, weigh, and stir to it an equal proportion of the finest 
sugar, dried and reduced to powder ; when this is dissolved, 
place the preserving-pan over a very clear fire, and stir the 
jelly often until it boils ; clear it carefully from scum, and 
boil it quickly ifrom fifteen to twenty-five minutes. 

Equal weight of strawberry-juice and sugar: 15 to 25 
minutes. 

Obs, — This receipt is for a moderate quantity of the pre- 
serve : a Tery small portion will require much less time. 

TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES OR RASPBERRIES, FOR CREAMS 

OR ICES, WITHOUT BOILING. 

Let the fruit be gathered in the middle of a warm day, in 
very dry weather; strip it from the stalks directly, weigh it, 
turn it into a bowl or deep pan, and bruise it gently ; mix 
with it an equal weight of fine dry sifted sugar, and put it 
immediately into small, wide-necked bottles; cork these firmly 
without delay, and tie bladder over the tops. Keep them in a 
cool place, or the fruit will ferment. The mixture should be 
stirred softly, and only just sufficiently to blend the sugar and 
the fruit. The bottles must be perfectly dry, and the bladders, 
after having been cleaned in the usual way, and allowed to 
become nearly so, should be moistened with a little spirit on

the side which is to be next to the cork. Unless these pre- 
cautions be obseiredy tiiere will be some danger of the whole 
being spoiled. 
Equal weight of froit and sugar. 

KA8PBERRT JAM. 

Braise gently, with the back of a wooden spoon, six pounds 
of ripe and freshly-gathered raspberries, and boil them over a 
brisk fire for twenty-five minntes ; stir to them half their weight 
of good sugar, roughly powdered, and when it is dissolved, hoil 
the preserve quicUy for ten minutes, keeping it well stirred 
and skimmed. When a richer jam is wished for, add to the 
fruit at first its full weight of sugar, and boil them together 
twenty minutes. 

Barberries, 6 lbs. : 25 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 10 minutes. 

GOOD RED OR WHITE RASPBERRY JAM. 

Boil quickly, for twenty minutes, four pounds of either red 
or white sound ripe raspberries in a pound and a half of car- 
rant-juice of the same colour; take tne pan from the fire, stir 
in three pounds of sugar, and when it is dissolved, place the 
pan again orer the fire, and continue the boiling for ten mi- 
nntes longer : keep the preserve well skimmed and stured 
from the beginning. 

Baspberries, 4 lbs. ; currant-juice, l\ lb. : 20 minutes. Su- 
gar, 3 lbs. : 10 minutes^ 

RASPBERRY JELLY FOR FLAVOURING CREAMS. 

Take the stalks from some quite ripe, and freshly-gatheied 
raspberries, stir them over the fire until they render their joioe 
fireely, then strain and weigh it ; or press it from them throagh 
a cloth, and then strain it clear; in either case boil it for five 
minutes after it is weighed, and for each pound stir in a ijound 
and a quarter of good sugar, reduced quite to powder, sificed, 
and made very hot ; boil the preserve quickly for five minoteB 
longer, and skim it clean. The jelly thus made will sufSdendy 
sweeten the creams yithout any additional sugar. 

Juice of raspberries, 4 lbs. : 5 mjnutes. Sugar, made ho^ 
5 lbs. : 5 minutes. 

ANOTHER RASPBERRY JELLY. 

( Very goocL) 
Bruise the fruit a little, and draw the juice firom it by fo«i 
or five minutes gentle simmering; strain and weigh it, boil it 



COAP. XXI.3 PRBSERYBS. 477 

quickly for twenty minutes, draw it from the fire^ add three- 
quarters of a pound of good sugar for each pound of juice, and 
when this is dissolved, place the pan again on the fire, and hoil 
the preserve /o^^ from twelve to fifteen minutes longer ; skim 
it thoroughly, and keep it well stirred. This jelly is infinitely 
improved in colour and in firmness, though not perhaps in fla- 
vour, by mixing with the raspberry juice one-fourth, or even 
as much as a third of the juice of ripe white currants : the pre- 
serve will then require rather less boiling. When it jellies in 
falling from the spoon or skimmer, it is done. Nothing of tin 
or iron should be used in making it, as these metals will convert 
its fine red colour into a dingy purple. 

Fruit, simmered 5 to 6 minutes. Juice of raspberries, 4 lbs. : 
20 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs.: 12 to 15 minutes. Or, juice of 
raspberries, 4 lbs. ; juice of white currants, 2 lbs. : 20 minutes* 
Sugar, 4^ lbs. : 10 minutes, or less. 

GREEN CURRANT JAM. 

For each pound of currants take fourteen ounces of good 
sugar, in fine powder; bruise part of the fruit with a small 
portion of the sugar, and put it first into the preserving pan, 
that the juice ma^ flow from it sufficiently to prevent the 
ranainder from being burned; it should be placed over a very 
gentle fire, and stirred constantly until it has yielded moisture 
enough for this. All the fruit and sugar may then be added, 
and the whole (well mixed and stirred) boiled from ten to fif- 
teen minutes, or until it jellies strongly in falling from the 
skimmer. Some fruit will require less time, and some rather 
more. 

To each pound of currants^ stripped from stalks, 14 ozs. of 
sugar : 10 to 15 minutes. 

RED CURRANT JELLT. 

With three parts of fine ripe red currants freshly gathered, 
and stripped from the stalks, mix one of white currants ; put 
them into a clean preserving pan, and stir them gently over a 
clear fire until the juice flows from them freely; then turn 
them into a fine hair-si^ve, and let them drain well, but with* 
out pressure. Pass the juice through a folded muslin, or a 
jelly-bag ; weigh it, and then boil it fast for a quarter of an 
hour; add for each pound, eight ounces of sugar coarsely 
powdered, stir this to it off' the fire until it is dissolved, give 
the jelly eight minutes more of quick boiling, and pour it out. 
It wiU be firm, and of excellent colour and flavour. Be sure 



478 MODBBN CXX>KEBT. (jCHAP. XXI. 

to clear off the scorn as it rises both before and after the sugar 
is pat in, or the preserve will not be clear. 

Juice of red currants, 3 lbs. ; juice of white currants, I lb. : 
15 minates. Sogar, 2 lbs. : 8 minutes. 

O&t. — ^An excellent jelly may be made with equal parts of 
the juice of red and of white currants, and of raspberries, 
with the same proportion of sugar and degree of boiling as in 
the foregoing receipt. 

SUPERLATIYE RED CURRANT JELLT. 

{Norman Receipt,) 

Strip carefully from the stems some quite-ripe currants of 
the finest quality, and mix with them an eaual weight of good 
sugar reduced to powder ; boil these together quickly for ex- 
acUy eight minut^ keep them stirred all the time, and clear 
off the scum as it rises ; then turn the preserve into a very 
clean sieve, and put into small jars the jelly which runs 
through it, and which will be delicious in flavour, and of the 
brightest colour. It should be carried immediately, when this 
is practicable, to an extremely cool but not a damp place, and 
left there till perfectly cold. The currants which remain in 
the sieve make an excellent jam, particularly if only part of 
the jelly be tsJien from them. In Normandy, where the firuit 
is of richer quality than in England, this preserve is boiled 
only one minute, and is both firm and beautifully trans- 
parent. 

Currants, 3 lbs. ; sugar, 3 lbs.: 8 minutes. 

FRENCH CURRANT JELLT. 

Mix one third of white currants with two of red, and stir 
them over a gentle fire until they render their juice freely, 
pour it from tnem, strain and weigh it ; for every four pounds 
break three of fine sugar into large lumps, just dip them into 
cold water, and when they are nearly dissolved boil them to a 
thick syrup ; stir this without ceasing until it falls in lai^e 
thick white masses from the skinmier; then pour in the 
currant juice inunediately, and when the sugar is again dis- 
solved, boil the whole quickly for five minutes, clear off the 
^um perfectly, pour the jelly into jars or warm glasses, and 
set it in a cool place. 

Red currants, two thirds ; white currants, one third ; juice, 

4 lbs. ; sugar boiled to candy height, 3 lbs. ; jelly boiled :

jelly in France, the preserve being there never served with 
any kind of joint, as it is with us. 

DELICIOUS RED CtJRRANT JAM. 

This, which is but an indifferent preserve when made in 
the usual way, will be found a very fine one if the following 
directions for it be observed ; it will be extremely transparent 
and bright in colour, and will retain perfectly the flavour of 
the fruit. Take the currants at the height of their season the 
finest that can be had, free from dust, but gathered on a' dry 
day; strip them with great care from the stalks, weigh and 
put them into a preserving pan with three pounds of the best 
sugar reduced to powder to four pounds of tne fruit j stir them 
gently over a brisk clear fire, and boil them quickly for 
exactly eight minutes from the first full boil. As the jam is 
apt to rise over the top of the pan, it is better not to fill it 
more than two thirds, and if this precaution should not be 
sufficient to prevent it, it must be lifted from the fire and held 
away for an instant. To many tastes, a still finer jam than 
this (which we find sufliciently sweet) may be made with an 
equal weight of fruit and sugar boHed together for seven 
minutes. There should be great exactness with respect to 
the time, as both the flavour and the brilliant colour of the 
preserve will be injured by longer boiling. 

Bed currants (without stalfo), 4 lbs. j fine sugar, 3 lbs. : 
boiled quickly 8 minutes. Or, equal weight fruit and sugar : 
7 minutes. 

VERY FINE WHITE CURRANT JELLY. 

The fruit for this jelly should be very white, perfectly free 
from dust, and picked carefully from the staJks. To every 
pound add eighteen ounces of double refined sifted sugar, and 
boil them together quickly for six minutes ; throw in the strained 
juice of a sound fresh lemon, or of two, should the quantity 
of preserve be large ; boil it two minutes longer j pour it into 
a delicately clean sieve, and finish it by the directions given 
for the Norman red currant jelly (page 478). 

While cunrants, 6 lbs. ; highly-refined sugar, 6i lbs. : 6 
minutes. Juice of 2 moderate-sized lemons : 2 minutes. 

WHITE CURRANT JAM, A BEAUTIFUL PRESERVE. 

Boil together quickly for seven minutes equal quantities of 
fine white currants, picked with the greatest nicety, and of 
the best sugar pounded and passed through a sieve. Stir the 



480 MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. XXI. 

pteserve gently tbe whole time, and be caiefdl to skim it 
thoroughly. Just before it is taken from the fire throw in 
the strained juice of one good lemon to four pounds of the 
fruit 
White coixantSy 4 lbs.; best sugar, 4 lbs. : 7 minutes. Juice, 

1 lemon. 

CURRANT PASTE. 

Stalk and heat some red currants as for jelly, pour off three 
parts or the juice, which can be used for that preserve, and 
press the remainder, with the pulp of the fruit, closely throogfa 
a hair-sieye reversed ; boil it briskly, keeping it stirred the whole 
time, until it forms a dry paste ; then for each pound (when 
first weighed) add seven ounces of pounded sugar, and boil 
the whole from twenty-five to thirty minutes longer, taking 
care that it shall not bum. This paste is remarkably plea- 
sant and refreshing in cases of fever, and acceptably usually 
for winter^desserts. 

Red currants boiled from 5 to 7 minutes, pressed with one 
fourth of their juice throueh a sieve, boiled from 1| to 

2 hours. To each pound add 7 ozs. pounded sugar : 25 to 
30 minutes. 

Obs. — Confectioners add the pulp, after it is boiled dry, to 
an equal weight of sugar at the candy height: by malnng 
trial of the two methods the reader can decide on the better 
one. 

BLACK CURRANT JELLT. 

After having extracted the juice of the fruit in the usual 
way, proceed exactly with regard to the time of boiling, and 
the proportion of sugar as in the first receipt for red currant 
jelly in the present chapter. This is a most refreshing and 
useful preserve in illness ; and in many cases no other will 
supply its place ; it may be made with Lisbon sugar on 
occasion* 

NURSERY PRESERVE. 

Take the stones from a couple of pounds of Kentish cber- 
ries, and boil them twenty minutes; then add to them a ponn^ 
and a half of raspberries, and an equal quantity of red and of 
white currants, all weighed after they have been cleared fnoi 
their stems. Boil these together briskly for twenty minutes; mil 
with them three pounds and a quarter of common sugar, and 
give the preserve fifteen minutes more of quick boiliDg. A 



CHAP. XXI.] PRESERTES. 481 

pound and a half of ffoosebenies may be substituted for the 
cherries ; but they will not require any stewing before they 
are added to the other fruits. The jam must be well stirred 
from the beginning, or it will bum to the pan. 

Kentish cherries, 2 lbs. : 20 minutes. Raspberries, red 
carrants, and white currants^ of each 1} lb.: 20 minutes. 
Sugar, 3) lbs. : 15 minutes. 

ANOTHER GOOD COMMON PRESERVE. 

Boil together, in equal or in unequal portions (for this is 
immaterial), any kinds of early fruit, till they can be pressed 
through a sieve ; weigh, and then boil the pulp over a brisk 
fire for half an hour; add half a pound of su^ar for each 
pound of fruit, and again boil the preserve quickly, keeping 
It well stirred and skimmed, from fifteen to twenty minutes. 
Cherries, unless they be morellas, must be first stewed tender 
apart, as they will require a much longer time to make them 
so than other of the first summer fruits. 

A GOOD M^LANOE^ OR MIXED PRESERVE. 

Boil for three quarters of an hour in two pounds of clear 
red gooseberry juice, one pound of very ripe greengages, 
Weighed after they have been pared and stoned ; then stir to 
them one pound and a half of good sugar, and boil them 
quickly again for twenty minutes. If the quantity of preserve 
he much increased, the time of boiling it must be so likewise ; 
this is always better done before the sugar is added. 

Juice of ripe gooseberries, 2 lbs. ; greengages, pared and 
stoned, 1 lb. : i hour. Sugar, 1 h lb. : 20 minutes. 

GROSEILLl^E. 

{Another good preserve,) 

Cut the tops and stalks from a gallon or more o£ well-fla« 
voured ripe gooseberries, throw them into a large preserving- 
pan, boil them for ten minutes, and stir them often with a 
wooden spoon ; then pass both the juice and pulp through a 
£ne sieve, and to every three pounds' weight of these add naif 
a pint of raspberry-juice, and boil the whole briskly for three 
quarters of an hour ; ^w the pan aside, stir in for the above 
portion of fruit, two pounds of sugar, and when it is dissolved 
i^enew the boiling for fifteen minutes longer. 

Ripe gooseberries, boiled 10 minutes. Pulp and juice of

be boiled with the gooseberries at first. 

A FIXE PRESmVB OF THE GREEN ORANGE PLUM 

(Sonefsnet eaiied the SUmewood pkanJ) 

This fruit, which is rery insipid when ripe, makes an ex- 
cellent preserve if used when at its fiill growth, bttt while it 
is still quite hard and green. Take off the stalks, weigh the 
plums, then gash them well (with a silver knife, if conyenient) 
as they are uirown into the preserving pan, and keep them 
stirred without ceasing, over a moderate fire, until they have 
yielded sufficient juice to prevent their burning; after this 
boil them quickly until the stones are entirely detached from 
the flesh of the fruit. Take them out as they appear on the 
surface, and when the preserve looks quite smooth and is well 
reduced, stir in three quarters of a pound of sugar beaten to 
powder, for each pound of the plums, and boil the whole 
very quickly for haJf an hour, or more. Put it, when done, 
into small moulds or pans, and it will be sufficiently firm 
when cold to turn out well : it will be also of a fine trans- 
parent green colour, and very agreeable to the taste. 

Orange plums, when green, 6 lbs.: 40 to 60 minutes. 
Sugar, 4| lbs. : 30 to 50 minutes. 

Ohs, — The blanched kernels of part of the fruit should be 
added to this preserve a few minutes before it is poured out : 
if too long boiled in it they will become tough. They should 
always be wiped veiy dry after they are blanched. 

GREENGAGE JAM, OR MARMALADE. 

When the plums are thoroughly ripe, take off the skins, 
stone, weigh, and boil them quickly without sugar for fifty 
minutes, keeping them well stirred; then to every four pounds 
add three of grod sugar reduced quite to powder, boil the 
preserve from five to eight minutes^ longer, and dear off the 
scum perfectly before it is poured into the jars. When the 
flesh of the fruit will not separate easily from the stones, 
weigh and throw the plums whole into the preserving pan, 
boil them to a pulp, pass them through a sieve, and deduct 
the weight of the stones from them when apportioning the 
sugar to the jam. The Orleans pliun may be substituted for 
greengages, in this receipt. 

Greengages, stoned and skinned, 6 lbs.: 50mmnte5. Sugar, 
4| lbs. : 5 to 8 minutes. 



CHAP. XXI.]] PRESERVES. 483 

PRESERVE OF THE MAGNUM BONUM, OR MOGUL PLUM. 

Prepare, weigh, and boil the plums for forty minutes ; stir 
to them half their weight of good sugar beaten fine, and when 
it is dissolved continue the boiling for ten additional minutes, 
and skim the preserve carefully during the time. This is an 
excellent marmalade, but it may be rendered richer by in- 
creasing the proportion of sugar. The blanched kernels of a 
portion of the fruit-stones will much improve its flavour, but 
they should be mixed with it only two or three minutes before 
it is taken from the fire. When these plums are not entirely 
ripe, it is difficult to free them from the stones and skins : 
they should then be boiled down and pressed through a sieve, 
as directed for greengages, in the receipt above. 

Mogul plums, skmned and stoned, 6 lbs. : 40 minutes. 
Sugar, 3 lbs. : 5 to 8 minutes. 

TO DRY OR PRESERVE MOGUL PLUMS IN SYRUP. 

Pare the plums, but do not remove the stalks nor stones ; 
take their weight of dry sifted sugar, lay them in a deep dish 
or bowl, and strew it over them; let them remain thus for a 
night, then pour them gently into a preserving pan, with all 
the sugar, heat them slowly, and let them just simmer for 
five minutes ; in a couple of days repeat the process, and do 
so again and again at an interval of two or three days, until 
.the fruit is tender and very clear; put it then into jars, and 
keep it in the syrup, or drain and dry the plums very gra- 
dually, as directed for other fruit. When they are not suffi- 
ciently ripe for the skin to part from them easily, they must 
be covered with spring water, placed over a slow fire, and 
just scalded until it can be stripped off easily. 

MUSSEL PLUM CHEESE AND JELLY. 

Fill large stone jars with the fruit, which should be ripe, 
dry, and soimd, set them into an oven from which the bread 
has been drawn several hours, and let them remain all night ; 
or, if this cannot conveniently be done, place them in pans of 
water, and boil them gently until the plums are tender, and 
have yielded their juice to the utmost. Pour this from them, 
strain it through a jelly bag, weigh, and then boil it rapidly 
for twenty-five minutes. Have ready, broken small, three 
pounds 01 sugar for four of the juice, stir them together 
until it is dissolved, and then continue the boiling quickly for 
ten minutes longer, and be careful to remove all the scum.

and press it into shallow pans or moulds. 

Plums, 3 lbs. : H hour. Sugar, lib. : 30 minutes. 

TO DBT APRICOTS. 

{A quick and easy meihotL) 

Wipe gently, split, and stone some fine apricots, which are 
not over-ripe; weigh, and arrange them evenly in a deep 
dish or bowl, and strew in fourteen ounces of sugar, in fine 
powder, to each pound of fruit ; on the following day turn 
the whole carefully into a preserving-pan, let the apricots 
heat slowly, and simmer them very softly for six minutes, or 
for an instant longer, should they not in that time be quite 
tender. Let them lay in the syrup for a day or two, then 
drain and spread them singly on dishes to dry. 

To each pound apricots, 14 ozs. of sugar : to stand 1 night, to 
be simmered ftom 6 to 8 minutes, and left in syrup 2 or 3 days. 

DRIED APRICOTS. 

{French Receipt.) 

Take apricots which have attained their full growth and 
colour, but before they begin to soften: weigh, and wipe 
them lightly ; make a small incision across the top of each 
plum, pass the point of a knife through the stalk-end, and 
gentl V push out the stones without breaking the fruit ; next, 
put the apricots into a preserving-pan, with plenty of cold 
water, place it over a moderate fire, and when it begins to 
boil, should the apricots be quite tender, lift them out, and 
throw them into more cold water, but simmer them, otherwise, 
until they are so. Take the same weight of sugar that there 
was of the fruit before it was stonea, and boil it for ten 
minutes with a quart of water to the four pounds ; skim the 
syrup carefully, throw in the apricots (wnich should pre- 
viously be well drained on a soft cloth, or on a sieve), simmer 
them for one minute, and set them by in it until the following 



CHAP. XXI.]] FRESERYBS. 485 

day, then drain it from them, boil it for ten minutes, and j^ur 
it on them the instant it is taken from the fire ; in forty-eight 
hours repeat the process, and when the syrup has boiled ten 
minutes, put in tne apricots, and simmer them from two to 
four minutes, or until they look quite clear. They may be 
stored in the syrup until wanted for drying, or drained from it, 
laid separately on slates or dishes, and dried very gradually: 
the blanched kernels may be put inside the fruit, or added to 
the syrup. 

Apricots, 4 lbs., scalded until tender ; sugar, 4 lbs. ; water, 

1 quart: 10 minutes. Apricots, in syrup, 1 minute; left 24 
hours. Syrup, boiled again, 10 minutes, and poured on fruit : 
stand 2 days. Syrup, boiled again, 10 minutes, and apricots 

2 to 4 minutes, or until, clear. 

Obs, — The syrup should be quite -thick when the apricots 
are put in for the last time ; but both fruit and sugar vary so 
much in quality, and in the degree of boiling which they re- 
quire, that no invariable rule can be given for the latter. The 
apricot syrup strained very clear, and mixed with twice the 
measure of pale French brandy, makes an agreeable liqueur, 
which is much improved by infusing in it for a few days half 
an ounce of the miit-kemels, blanched and bruised, to the 
quart of liquor. 

We have found that cherries prepared by either of the re- 
ceipts which we have given for preserving them with sugar, 
if thrown into the apricot syrup when partially dried, just 
scsdded in it, and left for a fortnight, then drained and dried 
as usual, become a delicious sweetmeat. Mussel, imperatrice, 
or any other plums, when quite ripe, if simmered m it very 
gently until they are tender, and left for a few days to imbibe 
its flavour, then drained and finished as usual, are likewise 
excellent, 

PEACH JAM, OR MARMALADE. 

The fruit for this preserve, which is a very delicious one, 
should be. finely flavoured, and quite ripe, thoueh perfectly 
sound. Pare, stone, weigh, and boil it quickly for three 
quarters of an hour, and do not fail to stir it often during the 
time ; draw it from the fire, and mix with it ten ounces of 
well-refined sugar, rolled or beaten to powder, for each pound 
of the peaches; clear it carefully from scum, and boil it 
briskly for five minutes; throw in the strained juice of one or 
two good lemons ; continue the boiling for three minutes only, 
and pour out the marmalade. Two minutes after the sugar is 



489 MOPERN COOKERY. [^MAF.. XXI. 

Stirred to the fruit, add the bUnched kernels of part of the 
peaches. 

Peaches, stoned and pared, 4 lbs. : } hour. Sogar, 2} lbs. : 
2 minutes. Blanched peach-kernels : 3 minutes. Juice of 2 
small lemons : 3 minutes. 

Obs. — This jam, like most others, is improved by pressing 
the fruit through a sieve after it has been partially -boiled. 
Nothing can be finer than its flavour, which would be injured 
by adding the sugar at first ; and a larger proportion renden 
it cloyingly sweet. Nectarines and peaches mixed, make an 
admirable preserve. 

TO PRESERVE, OR TO DRY PEACHES OR NECTARINES. 

(^An easy and excellent Receipt,) 

The fruit should be fine, freshly gathered, and fidly ripe, 
but still in its perfection. Pare, halve, and weigh it after the 
stones are removed ; lay it into a deep dish, and strew over it an 
equal weight of highly refined pounded sugar ; let it remain 
until this is nearly dissolved, then lift Uie miit gently into a 
preserving pan, pour the juice and sugar to it, and heat the 
whole over a very slow fire ; let it just simmer for ten minutes, 
then turn it softly into a bowl, and let it remain a couple of 
days ; repeat the slow-heating and simmering at interrals of 
two or three days, until the fruit is quite clear, when it may 
be potted in the syrup, or drained from it, and dried upon 
large clean slates or disnes, or upon wire-sieves. The flavour 
wiU be excellent. The strained juice of a lemon may be 
added to the syrup, with good eflect, towards the end of the 
process, and an additional ounce or two of sugar allowed 
for it. 

DAMSON JAM. (VERY GOOD.) 

The fruit for this jam should be freshly gathered and quite 
ripe. Split, stone, weigh, and boil it quickly for forty minutes ; 
then stir in half its weight of good sugar roughly powdered, 
and when it is dissolved, give the preserve fifteen minutes 
additional boiling, keeping it stirred, and thoroughly skimmed. 

Damsons, stoned, 6 lbs. : 40 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : I^ 
minutes. 

Obs. — A more refined preserve is made by pressing the Mt 
through a sieve after it is boiled tender; but the jam is excel- 
lent without. 

DAMSON JELLY. 

Bake separately in a very slow oven, or boil in a water-bath 



CHAP. XXI.]] PBEBERYES. 487 

(see page 467)} any number of fine ripe damsons, and one 
third the quantity of bullaces, or of any other pale plums, as a 
portion of their juice will, to most tastes, improve, by soften- 
ing the flavour of the preserve, and will render the colour 
brighter. Four off the juice clear from the fruit, strain and 
weigh it; boil it quickly without sugar for twenty-five 
minutes, draw it from the fire, stir into it ten ounces of good 
sugar for each pound of juice, and boil it quickly from six to 
ten minutes longer, carefully clearing off all the scum. The 
jelly must be often stirred before the sugar is added, and con- 
stantly afterwards. 

PAMSON SOLID. (GOOD.) 

Four the juice from some damsons which have stood for 
a night in a very cool oven, or been stewed in a jar placed in 
a pan of water ; weigh and put it into a preserving pan with 
a pound and four ounces of pearmains (or of any other fine 
boiling apples'), pared, cored, and quartered, to each pound of 
the j nice ; boil these together, keeping them well stirred, from 
twenty- five to thirty minutes, then add the sugar, and when 
it is nearly dissolved, continue the boiling for ten minutes. 
This, if done with exactness, will give a perfectly smooth and 
firm preserve, which may be moulded in small shapes, and 
turned out for table. 

To each pound clear damson-juice, l\ lb. pearmains (or other 
good apples), pared and cored : 25 to 30 minutes. Sugar, 14 
ozs. : 10 minutes. 

EXCELLENT DAMSON CHEESE. 

When the fruit has been baked or stewed tender, as directed 
above, drain off the juice, skin and stone the damsons, pour 
back to them from a third to half their juice, weigh and then 
boil them over a clear brisk fire until they form a quite dry 
paste ; add six ounces of pounded sugar for each pound of the 
plums ; stir them off the fire until this is dissolved, and boil 
the preserve again without quitting or ceasing to stir it, until 
it leaves the pan quite dry, and adheres in amass to the spoon. 
If it should not stick to the fingers when lightly touched, it 
will be sufficiently done to keep very long ; press it quickly 
into pans or moulds ; lay on it a paper dipped in spirit when 
it is perfectly cold ; tie another fold over it, and store it in a 
dry place. 

Bullace cheese is made in the same manner, and almost any 
kind of plum will make an agreeable preserve of the sort. 

To each pound of > fruit, pared, stoned, and mixed with the 



488 MODERN COOKERY. ^CHAP. XXI. 

juice, and boiled quite dry, 6 ozs. of pounded sugar : boiled 
again to a dry paste* 

GRAPE JELLT, 

Strip from tbeir stalks some fine ripe black-cluster grapes, 
and stir them with a wooden spoon over a gentle fire until all 
have bursty and the juice flows freely from them; strain it off 
without pressure, and pass it through a jelly-bag, or through 
a twice folded muslin ; weigh and then boil it rapidly for 
twenty minutes ; draw it from the fire, stir in it till dissolved, 
fourteen ounces of good sugar, roughly powdered, to each 
pound of juice, and boil the jelly quickly for fifteen minutes 
longer, keeping it constantly stirred, and perfectly well skim- 
med. It will 1^ very clear, and of a beautiful pale rose-colour. 

Juice of black-cluster grapes : 20 minutes. To each pound 
of juice, 14 ozs. good sugar: 15 minutes. 

Obs, — We have proved this jelly only with the kind of 
grape which we have named, but there is little doubt that 
hne purple grapes of any sort would answer for it well. 

ENGLISH GUAVA. 

Strip the stalks from a gallon or t^o of the large kind of 
bullaces called the shepherd-s bullace ; ^ive part of them a 
cut, put them into stone jars, and throw into one of them a 
pound or two of imperatrice plums, if they can be obtained ; 
put the jars into pans of water, and boil them as directed at 
page 467; then drain off the juice, pass it through a thick 
strainer or jelly- bag, and weigh it ; boil it quickly from fifteen 
to twentv minutes ; take it from the fire, and stir in it till 
dissolved three Quarters of a pound of sugar to the pound of 
juice ; remove tiie scum with care, and boil the preserve 
again quickly from eiffht to twelve minutes, or longer should 
it not then jelly firmljr on the skimmer. When the fruit is 
very acid, an equal weight of juice and sugar may be mixed 
together in the first instance, and boiled briskly for about 
twenty minutes. It is impossible to indicate the precise time 
which the jelly y(i\\ require, so much depends on the quality 
of the plums, ai^ on the degree of boiling previously given 
to them in the water-bath. When properly made it is re- 
markably transparent and very firm, it should be poured 
into shallow pans or small moulds, and turned from them be- 
fore it is served.', . When the imperatrice plum cannot be pro^ 
cured .an y other Jhat will give a pale red colour to the j[uice 



1 



CHAP. XXI,3 PRESERVES. 489 

will answer. The ballaces alone make an admirable pre- 
serve ; and even the commoner kind afford an excellent one. 

Juice of the shepherd's bull ace and imperatrice, or other 
red plum, 4 lbs. : 15 to 20 minutes. Sugar, 3 lbs. : 8 to 12 
minutes. Or juice of bullaces and sugar, equal weight : 
20 minutes. 

Obs. — After the juice has been poured from the plums they 
may be stoned, pared, weighed, and boiled to a paste ; then 
six ounces of sugar added to the pound, and the boiling con- 
tinued until the preserve is again very dry : a small portion of 
the juice should oe left with the fruit for this. 

VERT FINE IMPERATRICE-PLUM MARMALADE. 

Weigh six pounds of the fruit when it is quite ripe, but 
before the frost has touched it ; give each plum a cut as it is 
thrown into the preserving pan, and when all are done boil 
them from thirty-nve to forty minutes, taking out the stones as 
they rise to the surface, when they are quite detached from 
the flesh of the fruit. Draw back the pan from the fire, stir 
in two pounds of good sugar beaten to powder, and boil the 
preserve quickly for fifteen minutes. The imperatrice plum 
is of itself so sweet that this proportion of sugar makes with 
it a very rich preserve. 

Imperatrice plums (without the stalks) 6 lbs. ; boiled 35 
to 40 minutes. Sugar, 2 lbs. (added after the stones are 
out), 15 minutes. 

Obs. — Some slight trouble would be avoided by pressing 
the fruit through a sieve after the first boiling ; but we do 
not think the maimalade would be improved by being freed 
from the skins of the plums. 

TO DRY IMPERATRICE PLUMS. 

{An easy method.) 

Pat them into jars, or wide-necked bottles, with half a 
pound of good sugar, rolled or pounded, to twice the weight 
of fruit; set them into a very cool oven for four and five 
hours ; or if more convenient place them, with a little hay 
between them, in a pan of cold water, and boil them gently 
for rather more than three hours. Leave them in the syrup 
for a few days, and finish them as directed for the drying of 
other fruits. Tie a bladder over the necks of the jars or 
bottles before they are placed in the pan of water, and fasten 
two or three folds of paper over the former, or cork the bottles 
when the fruit is to be baked. The sugar should be put in 



4$0 MODSBK OOOKfiBT. [cHAP. XXX* 

after the findt, without hemg shaken down; it will then dis- 
sohre gTadmUy* and be abmfaed by it equally. 

To eadi pound of plums, 8 ounces pounded sugar : baked 
in cool oTcn 4 or 5 hman, or steamed 3 hours. 

TO BOTTLB FRUIT FOR WINTER USB. 

Gather the fruit in the middle of the day in rery dry 
weather; strip off the stalks, and hare in readiness some per- 
firctly dean and dr^ wide-necked bottles ; torn each of these 
the instant before it is filled, with the neck downwards, and 
hold in it two or three lighted matches ; drop in the froit 
before the Yapour escapes, shake it gently down, press in 
some new corks, dip the necks of the bottles into melted 
rosin, set them at night into an oren £rom which the bread 
has been drawn six or seven hours at least, and let them 
remain until the morning : if the heat be too great the bottles 
will burst. Currants, cherries, damsons, greengages, and 
various odier kinds of plums will remain good &r quite 
twelve months- when bottled thus if stored in a dry place. 

To steam the firdt, put the bottles into a copper or other 
vessel up to their necks m cold water, with a uttle hay be- 
tween vad under them; light the fire, let the water heat 
slowly, and keep it at the point of gentle simmering until 
the finiit is sufficiently scalded. Some kinds will of comse 
require a mudi longer time than others. From half to three- 
quaitcis of an hour will be sufficient for gooseberries, cur- 
rants^ and laspberries ; but the appearance of all will best 
denote their bemg done. When tney have sunk almost half 
the depth of the bottles, and the skins are shriTeQed, ex- 
tinguisli the fire, but leave them in the water until it is quite 
cold; then wipe and store the bottles in a dry place. A bit 
of moistened bladder tied over the corks is better than the 
rosin when the firuit is steamed, 

APPLE JELLY. 

Various kinds of apples may be used successfully to make 
this jelly, but the nonsuch is by many persons preferred to 
all others for the purpose. The Ripstone pipnin, however, 
may be used for it with very good effect, eitner soldy, or 
vritn a mixture of pearmains. It is necessary only that tlie 
fnut should be finety flavoured, and that it should boil easiljr 
to a mannalade. Fare, core, quarter, and weigh it quickly 
that it may not lose its colour, and to each pound poor a pint 
of cold water, and boil it until it is well broken, without 



COAP. XXI.^ PRESERVBS. 491 

being reduced to a quite thick pulp, as it would then be diffi* 
cult to render the juice perfectly clear, which it ought to be. 
Drain this well from the apples, either through a fine sieve 
or a folded muslin strainer, and pass it afterwards through a 
jelly-bag, or turn the fruit at once into the last of these, and 
pour the liquid through a second time if needful. When it 
appears quite transparent, weigh, and reduce it by quick boil- 
ing for twenty minutes ; draw it from the fire, add two pounds 
of sugar, broken very small, for three of the decoction, stir 
it till it is entirely dissolved, then place the preserving-pan 
a^ain over a clear fire and boil the preserve quickly for ten 
minutes, or until it jellies firmly upon the ^skimmer when 
poured from it ; throw in the strained juice of a small lemon 
for every two pounds of jelly, a couple of minutes before it 
is taken from the fire. 

Apples, 7 lbs.; water, 7 pints: i to full hour. Juice, 
6 lbs. : 20 minutes quick boiling. Sugar, 4 lbs. : 10 to 15 
minutes. Juice, 3 lemons. | 



EXCEEDINGLY FINE APPLE JELLT. 

Pare quickly some highly flavoured juicy apples of any 
kind, or of various kinds together, for this is immaterial; 
slice, without dividing them ; but first free them from the stalks 
and eyes, shake out some of the pips, and put the apples 
evenly into very clean large stone jars, just dipping an occa- 
sional layer into cold water as this is done, the better to pre- 
serve the colour of the whole. Set the jars into pans of water, 
and boil the fruit slowly until it is quite soft, then turn it into 
a jelly-bag or cloth and let the juice 'all drop from it. The 
quantity which it will have yielded will be small but it will 
be clear and rich. Weigh and boil it for ten minutes, then 
draw it from the fire, and stir into it, until it is entirely dis« 
solved, twelve ounces of good sugar to the pound and quarter 
(or pint) of juice. Place the preserve again over the fire and 
stir it without intermission, except to clear off the scum, until 
it has boiled from eight to ten minutes longer, for otherwise 
it will jelly on the sur&ce with the scum upon it, which it 
vill then be difficult to remove, as when touched it will 
break and fall into the preserve. The strained juice of one 
^nall fresh lemon to the pint of jelly should be thrown into 
it two or three minutes before it is poured out, and the rind of 
one or two cut very thin may be simmered in the juice before 
the sugar is added ; but the pale, delicate colour of the jelly 



492 MODERN COOKJ^Y. [^CHAP. XXI. 

will be injured by too mucb of it, and many persons would 
altogether prefer the pure flavour. 

Juice of apples, 1 quart, or 2§ lbs. : 10 minutes. Sugar, 
1 j^ lb. : 8 to 10 minutes. Juice 2 small lemons ; rind of L or 
more, at pleasure. 

Ohs, i. — ^The quantity of apples required for it renders this 
a rather expensive preserve, where they are not abundant; 
but it is a remarkably fine jelly, and turns out from the 
moulds in perfect shape and very firm. It may be served in 
the second course, or for dessert. It is sometimes made with- 
out paring the apples, or dipping them into the water, and the 
colour is then a aeep red : we have occasionally had a pint of 
water added to about a gallon and a half of apples, but the 
jelly was not then quite so fine in flavour. 

Obs. 2. — ^The best time for making this apple-jelly is from 
the end of November to Christmas. 

Obs, 3. — Quince jelly would, without doubt, be very fine 
made by this receipt ; but as the juice of that fruit is richer 
than that of the apple, a little water might be added. Alter- 
nate layers of apples and quinces would also answer well, we 
think. 

QUINCE JELLT. 

Pare, quarter, core, and weigh s6me ripe but quite sound 
quinces, as quickly as possible, and throw them as they are 
done into part of the water in which they are to be boiled, as 
directed at page 427 ; allow one pint of this to each pound of 
the fruit, and simmer it gently until it is a little broKen, but 
not so long as to redden the juice, which ought to be very pale. 
Turn the whole into a jelly-bag, or strain the liquid through a 
fine cloth, and let it drain very closely from it, but without the 
slightest pressure. Weigh the juice, put it into a delicately 
clean preserving-pan, and boil it quickly for twenty minutes; 
take it from the fire and stir into it, until it is entirely dissolved, 
twelve ounces of sugar for each pound of juice, or fourteen 
ounces if the fruit should be very acid, which it will be in the 
earlier part of the season ; keep it constantly stirred and tho- 
roughly cleared from scum, from ten to twenty minutes longer, 
or until it jellies strongly in falling from the skimmer ; then 
pour it directly into glasses or moulds. If properly made, it 
will be sufficiently firm to turn out of the latter, and it will be 
beautifully transj^arent, and rich in flavour. It may be made 
with an equal weight of juice and sugar mixed togeuier in the 
first instance, and boiled from twenty or thirty minutes. It is 



CHAP. XXI.] PRESERVES. 493 

difficult to state the time precisely, because from different 
causes it will vary very mucli. It should be reduced rapidly 
to the proper point, as long boiling injures the colour : this is 
always more perfectly preserved by boiling the juice without 
the sugar first. 

To each pound pared and cored quinces,! pint water : f to li 
hour. Juice, boiled 20 minutes. To each pound, 12 ozs. sugar: 
10 to 20 minutes. Or, juice and sugar equal weight : 20 to 30 
minutes* 

QUINCE MARMALADE. 

When to economize the fruit it is not an object, pare, core, 
and quarter some of the inferior quinces, and boil them in as 
much water as will nearly cover them, until they begin to 
break ; strain the juice from them, and for the marmalade put 
half a pint of it to each pound of fresh quinces : in preparing 
these, be careful to cut out the hard stony parts round the 
cores. Simmer them gentljr until they are perfectly tender, 
then press them, with the juice, through a coarse sieve; put 
them into a perfectly clean pan, and boil them till they form 
almost a dry paste ; add for each pound of ouinces and the 
half pint of juice, three quarters of a pound oi sugar, in fine 
powder, and boil the marmalade for half an hour, stirring it 
gently without ceasing: it will be very firm and bHght in 
colour. If made shortly after the fruit is gathered, a little 
additional sugar will be required ,* and when a richer and less 
dry marmalade is better liked, it must be boiled a shorter time, 
and an equal weight of fruit and sugar must be used. 

Quinces, pared and cored, 4 lbs.; prepared juice, 1 quart: 

2 to 3 hours. Boiled fast to dry, 20 to 40 minutes. Sugar, 

3 lbs. : 30 minutes. 

Richer marmalade : quinces, 4 lbs. ; juice, I quart ; sugar, 

4 lbs. 

QUINCE AND APPLE MARMALADE. 

Boil together, from three quarters of an hour to an hour, two 
pounds of pearmains, or of any other well-flavoured apples, in 
an equal weight of prepared quince-juice (see page 427), then 
take them from the fire, and mix with them a pound and a half 
of sugar, in fine powder ; when this is a little dissolved, set the 
pan again over a brisk fire, and boil the preserve for twenty 
minutes longer, keeping it stirred all the time. 

Prepared quince-juice, 2 lbs. ; apples, 2 lbs. : I to 1 houn 
Sugar, U lb. : 20 minutes. 



494 MODERN COOKERY. []CHAP. XSI. 



QUINCE PASTE. 

If the fiill flay our of the quinces he desired, stew them suffi- 
ciently tender to press through a sieve in the prepared juice of 
page 427 ; otherwise, in just water enough to about three parts 
cover them j when they are soft quite tnrough, lift them out, 
let them cool, and then pass them through a sieve; reduce 
them to a dry paste, over a very clear fire, and stir them con- 
stantly ; then weigh the fruit, and mix it with an equal propor- 
tion of pounded sugar, or with sugar boiled to candy height 
(we find the effect nearly the same, whichever method be ptff- 
sued), and stir the paste without intermission until it is again 
so dry as to quit the pan and adhere to the spoon in one large 
ball ; press it into shallow pans or dishes ; cut it, as soon as 
cold, into small squares, and, should they seem to require it, 
dry them with a very gentle degree of heat, and when they are 
again cold store them in tin cases with well-dried foolscap 
paper between them ; the paste may be moulded, when more 
convenient, and kept imtil it is wanted for table in a very dry 
place. In France, where the fruitjs admirably confected, the 
pate des coigns^ or quince paste, is somewhat less boiled than 
we have directed, and dried afterwards in the sun, or in an 
extremely gentle oven,- in square rims of tin, about an inch 
and a half deep, placed upon clean plates. 

JELLT OF SIBERIAN CRABS.* 

This fruit makes a jelly of beautifal colour, and of pleasant 
flavour also ; it may be stored in small moulds of omameatal 
shape, and turned out for a dessert dish. Take off the stalks, 
weigh, and wash the crabs ; then, to each pound and a half) 
add a pint of water, and boil them gently until they are 
broken, but do not allow them to fall to a pulp. Pour the 
whole into a jelly-bag, and when the juice is quite transparent, 
weigh it, put it into a clean preserving-pan, boil it quicKly for 
ten minutes, take it from the fire, and stir in it, till dissolved, 
ten ounces of fine sugary roughly powdered, to each pound of 
the juice; boil the jelly from twelve to fifteen minutes, skiinit 
very clean, and pour it into the mould. Should the qaaodtf 
be large, a few additional minutes boiling must be given to the 
juice before the sugar is added. 

To each U lb. of crabs; water, 1 pint: 12 to 18 minntes. 
Juice to be boiled fast, 10 minutes: sn&far, to each poand, 
10 ozs. : 12 to 15 minutes. . 



CHAP. XXI.] PRESERYEB. 495 



TO PRESERVE BARBERRIES IN BUNCHES. 

Take the finest barberries, without stones, that can be pro- 
cured, tie them together in bunches of four or five sprigs, and 
for each half pound of the fruit (which is extremely light), 
boil one pound of very good sugar in a pint of water for 
twenty minutes, and clear it well from scum ; throw in the 
fruit, let it heat gently, and then boil from five to seven 
minutes, when it will be perfectly transparent. So long as 
any snapping noise is heard, the fruit is not at all done; ;t 
should be pressed equally down into the syrup until the 
whole of the berries have burst ; it should then be turned into 
jars, which must be covered with skin, or with two or three 
folds of thick paper, as soon as the pre&erve is perfectly cold. 
The barberries tnus prepared make a beautiful garnish for 
sweet dishes, or for custard puddings. 

Barberries, tied in bunches, 1) lb. Sugar, 3 lbs. ; water, 1} 
pint : 20 minutes. Barberries 1x)iled in syrup, 5 to 7 minutes. 

BARBERRT JBLLT. 

To each pound of barberries, stripped from the stalks, put 
a pint and a half of cold water, and boil them for fifteen 
minutes ; bruise them with the back of a wooden spoon, pour 
them into hair-sieve or muslin strainer, and pass the juice 
afterwards through a jelly-bag. "When it appears perfectly 
clear, wei^h and then boil it fast for ten minutes; take it 
froni the nre, and stir into it as many pounds of sugar in fine 
powder as there were pounds of juice; when this is dissolved 
boil the jelly again for ten minutes, skim it carefully, and 
pour it into jars or glasses : if into the latter warm them pre- 
viously, or the boihng jelly may cause them to break. 

Barberries, 3 lbs. ; water, 4J pints : 15 minutes. Juice alone : 
10 minutes. To each pound of juice 1 lb. of sugar : 10 minutes. 

BARBERRY JAM. 

(A good Receipt*) 
The barberries for this preserve should be quite ripe, though 
they should not be allowed to hang until they begin to decay. 
Strip them from the stalks, throw aside such as are spotted, 
and for each pound of the fruit allow eighteen ounces of well- 
refined sugar 5 boil this, with one pint of water to every four 
pounds, until it becomes white, ana falls in thick masses from 
the spoon ; then throw in the fruit, and keep it stirred over a 



496 MODERN COOKERY. QcHAP. XXl. 

brisk fire for six minates only ; take off the scum, and pour it 
into jars or glasses. 

Sugar, 4ilbs. ; water, H pint, boiled to candy height. 
Barberries, 4 lbs.: 6 minutes. 

BARBERRY JAM. 

( Second Receipt, ) 

The preceding is an excellent receipt, but the preserve will 
be very good if eighteen ounces of pounded su^u* be mixed 
and boiled with tne fruit for ten minutes ; and this is done 
at a small expense of time and trouble. 

Sugar pounded, 2} lbs.; fruit, 2 lbs.: boiled 10 minutes. 

VERY COMMON BARBERRY JAM. 

Weigh the fruit after it has been stripped from the stalks, 
and boil it for ten minutes over a moderate fire, keeping it 
stirred all the time ; then add to it an equal weight of good 
Lisbon sugar, and boil the preserve for five minutes. 

Barberries, 3 lbs.: 10 minutes. Lisbon sugar, 31bs. : 5 
minutes. 

Obs. — The small barberry, without stones, must be used for 
the foregoing receipts, but for those which follow either soit 
will answer. 

SUPERIOR BARBERRY JELLY, AND MARMALADE. 

Strip the fruit from the stems, wash it in spring-water, 
drain, bruise it slightly, and put it into a clean stone jar, 
with no more liquid than the drops which hang about it 
Place the jar in a pan of water, and steam the fruit until it is 
quite tender : this will be in from thirty minutes to an hour. 
Pour off the clear juice, strain, ¥%igh, and boil it fiast from 
-five to seven minutes, with eighteen ounces of sugar to every 
pound. For the marmalade, press the barberries through a 
sieve with a wooden spoon, and boil them quickly for the same

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Rasp very slightly on a fine and delicately clean grater the 
rinds of some sound* Seville oranges; cut them in quarters, 
and separate the flesh from the rinds; then with the small 
end of a tea, or eg^, spoon, clear it entirely from the pips, 
and from the loose inner skin and film. Put the rinds into a 
large quantity of cold water, and change it when they have 
boiled about twenty minutes. As soon as they are perfectly 
tender lift them out, and drain them on a sieve ; slice them 
thin, and add eight ounces of them to each pound of the pulp 
and juice, with a pound and a half of highly-refined sugar in 
fine powder ; boil the marmalade quickly for half an hour, 
«kim it well, and turn it into the jars. This marmalade has 
not a very powerful flavour of the orange-rind. When more 
of this is liKed, either leave a portion of the fruit unrasped, 
or mix with the preserve some of the zest which has been 
grated ofi^, allowing for it its weight of sugar. Or proceed 
thus : allow to a dozen Seville oranges two fine juicy lemons, 
and take the weight of the whole in sifted sugar, of excellent 
quality. With a sharp knife cut through the rinds just deep 
enough to allow them to be stripped off in quarters with the 
end of a spoon, and throw them for a night into plenty of 
cold spring- water; on the following morning boil them sufli- 
ciently tender to allow the head of a pin to pierce them 
easily ; then drain them well, let them cool, and scrape out 
the white part of the rind, and cut the remainder into thin 
chips. In the mean time have the pulp of the fruit quite 
cleared from the pips and film ; put it with the sugar and 
chips into a preserving pan, heat it slowly, then boil it from 
twenty to thirty minutes : it will be very rich, good marma- 
lade. The sugar, first broken into large lumps, is sometimes 
made into a very thick syrup, with so much water only as 
will just dissolve it ; the pulp and juice are in that case boiled 
in it quickly for ten minutes before the chips are added ;' and 
a part of these are pounded and stirred into the preserve with 
the others. March is the proper month for maKing this pre- 
serve, the Seville orange being then in perfection. For lemon 
marmalade proceed exactly in the same manner as for this. 
The whole of the rinds of either fruit are pounded to a paste, 
and then boiled with the pulp, to make what is called trans- 
parent marmalade.

weight of oranges, first taken in sugar, and added, with all 
the rinds, to the pulp after the whole has been properly 
prepared* 

GENUINE SCOTCH MARMALADE. 

" Take some bitter oranges, and doable their weight of 
suear ; cut the rind of the fruit into quarters and peel it oS, 
and if the marmalade be not wanted very thick, take off some 
pf the spongy white skin inside the rind. Cut the chips as 
thin as possible, and about half an inch long, and divide the 
pulp into small bits, removing carefully the seeds, which may 
be steeped in part of the water that is to make the marmalade, 
and which must be in the proportion of a quart to a pound of 
fruit. Put the chips and pulp into a deep earthen dish, and 
pour the water boiling over them; let them remain for twelve 
or fourteen hours, and then turn the whole into the preserving 
pan, and boil it until the chips are perfectly tender. When 
they are so, add by degrees the sugar (which should be pre- 
viously pounded), and boil the marmalade until it jellies. 
The water in which the seeds have been steeped, and which 
must be taken from the quantity apportioned to the whole of 
the preserve, should be poured into a hair-sieve, and the seeds 
well worked in it with the back of a spoon ; a strong clear 
jelly will be obtained by this means, which must be washed 
off them by pouring their own liquor through the sieve in 
small portions over them. This must be added to the fruit 
when it is first set on the fire. 

Oranges, 3 lbs. ; water, 3 quarts ; sugar, 6 lbs.

guaranteed as an excellent one by the Scottish lady from

ORANGE CONSERVE FOR PUDDINGS. 

Wash and then soak in plenty of spring water for three 
days, changing it night and morning, half a dozen Seville 
oranges ; then boil them till they are sufficiently tender for 
the head of a pin to pierce them easily; drain and weigh 
them, and for each pound take and reduce to fine powder two 
pounds of good sugar. Cut the oranges asunder, and remofe 
the pips and the coarse loose skin of the cores ; then heft 
them, with the sugar, in a large mortar, and pick out as this 
is done any pits of fibre or coarse inner skin which cannot be 
reduced to a paste. When the whole forms a smooth conacrre, 
put it into small jars for use, as it requires no boiling after the 



CHA?. XXI.] PRESERVES. 499 

fmit and sugar are mixed : if stored in a dry place it will 
remain good for two years. Each orange should oe tied in a 
thin small cloth or a bit of muslin when it is boiled^ and the 
water should be changed once (or even twice when the fine 
aromatic bitter of the rind is altogether objected to), or the 
fruit may be lifted from the water and thrown immediately 
into another pan containing more which is ready boiling. 
Two tablespoonsful of this conserve, with the yolks of five or 
six eggs, a couple of ounces of sugar, and as much clarified 
butter smoothly mixed and well beaten together, will make 
good cheesecakes, or an excellent but not large pudding : the 
same proportion will be found an agreeable addition to a 
plum pudding also.

CHAPTER XXn. 
PICKLES. 




'ISiB first requisite in making pickles is to have unadulterated 
Tin^ar, for all the expense and trouble bestowed upon them is 
often entirely lost in consequence of ingredients being miied 
with this which soften, and sometimes even partialfy decompose, 
the substances immersed in it. That whiui is home-made is 
generally found for all purposes to answer best, and it may be 
, prepared of almost any degree of strength hy increasing Ibe 
ordinary proportion of fruit aiid sugar, or whatever else may be 
used for it. The refuse of raisin-wine, and green gooseberries, 
may both be converted into excellent vinegar ; but unless the 
pieties be quite covered with their liquor, and well protected 
from the air, and from the influence of damp, which is more tbin 
anything destructive of them, the pqrity of the vinegar will not 
preserve them eatable. We can confidently recommend to the 
reader the rather limited number of receipts which follow, and 
which might easily be mtdtipUed did the size of our voluine 
penniL Pickling is so easy a procesi, however, that when in 
any degree properly acquired, it may be extended to almod 
every kmd of fruit and vegetable succeasfuDy. A few of da 
chcdcer kinds will nevertheless be found generally more aceepl' 
able than a greater variety of inferior preparations. Mushroonn 
gherkins, walnuts, lemons, eschalots, and peaches, for »1! of 
which we have given minute directions, will furnish as motb 



CHAP. XXn.] PICKLES. 601 

choice as is eommotlj required. Very excellent Indian mangoes 
too may be purchased at the Italian warehouses, and to many 
tastes win be more acceptable than a^ Engli^ pickle. We 
have had them very sood from Mr. Cobbett, 18, Pall Mall, 
whose bouse we hare already had occasion to name. 

TO FICKI4B CHSBBIBS. 

Leave about an inch of their stalks on some fine, sound Kent* 
ish or Flemish cherries, that are not oyerripe ; pot them into a 
jar, cover than with cold vin^ar, and let them stand for three 
weeks ; pour off two thirds of the liquor and replace it with fresh 
vinegar ; then, after having drained it from the fruit, boil the 
whole with an ounce of coriander seed, a small blade of mace, a 
few grains of cayenn^ or a teaspoonfdl of white peppercorns, 
and four bruised cochmeab to every quart all tied loosely in a 
fold of muslin. Let the pickle become quite cold before it is 
added to the cherries : in a month they wiU be fit for use. The 
vinegar which is poured from the fruit makes a good mup of 
itself when boiled with a pound of sugar to the pint, but it is 
improved by having some fresh raspberries, cherries, or currants 
previously mfused m it for three or foiir days. 

TO PICKI«E GHSBJUNS. 

Let the gherkins be gathered <xi a dry day, before the firost 
has touched them ; take off the blossoms, put them into a stcme 
jar, andpoor over them sufficient boilii^ brine to cover them 
well. The following dAy take them out, wipe them singly, lay 
them into a dean stone jar, with a dozen bay leaves over them, 
and pour upon them the following pickle, when it is boiling fast : 
as much vinegar as will more than cover the gherldns oy an 
inch or two, with an ounce and a quarter of salt, a quarter- 
ounce of black peppercorns, an ounce and a half of ginger 
sliced, or slightly bruised, and two small blades of mace to every 
quart; put a ^te over the jar, and leave it for two days, then 
drain on the vinegar, and heat it afresh ; when it boils, tnrow in 
the gherkins, and keep than just on the point of simmering for 
two or three minutes ; pour the whole back into the jar, put the 
plate again upon it, and let it remain until the pickle is quite 
cold, when a skin, or two separate folds of thick brown paper, 
must be tied closely over it. The gherkins thus pickled are 
very crisp, and excellent in flavour, and the colour is sufficiently 
good to satisfy the prudent housekeeper, to whom the brilliant 
and. poisonous green produced by bouing the vinegar in a brass 
fikillet (a process constantly recommended in books of cookery) 



502 'MODERN COOKERY. [[CHAF. XXH* 

is anything but attractiye. To satisfy ourselves of the effect 
produced by the action of the acid on the metal, we had a few 
* gherkins thrown into some vinegar which was boiling in a brass 
pan, and nothing could be more beautiM than the colour which 
they almost immediately exhibited. We fear this dangerous 
method is too often resorted to in preparing pickles for sale. 

Brine to pour on gherkins : — 6 02». salt to each quart water : 
24 hours, rickle : — ^to each quart vinegar, salt, li oz. ; black 
peppercorns, i oz.; ginger, sliced or bruised, 1| oz.; mace, 2 small 
blades ; bay leaves ; .24 to 100 gherkins, more when the fla- 
vour is liked : 2 days. Gherkins simmered in vinegar, 2 to 3 
minutes. 

PICKLES. 

Ohs. — The quantity of vinegar required to cover the gherkins 
will be shown by that of the brine : so much depends upon 
their size, that it is impossible to direct the measure exactly, 
A larger proportion of spice can be added at pleasure. 

TO PICKLE NASTURTIUMS, 

These shoidd be gathered quite youn?, and a portion of the 
l)uds, when very small, should be mixed with them. Prepare 
a pickle by dissolving an ounce and a half of salt in a quart of 
;:paie vinegar, and throw in the berries as they become nt, firom 
day to day. They are used instead of capers for sauce, and by 
some persons are preferred to them. When purchased for 
pickling, put them at once into a jar, and cover tnem well with 
the vinegar. 

TO PICKLE GHERKINS. 

(A French Receipt') 

Brush or wipe the gherkins very clean, throw them into 
f)lenty of fast-boiling water, and give them a single boil, take 
4;hem out quickly, and throw them immediately into a large 
•quantity of very cold water ; change it once, and when the 
sherkins themselves are quite col^ drain them well, spread 
tnem on sieves or dishes, and dry them in the air. When this 
is.done, ^ut them into stone jars, and pour on them as much 
boiling vinegar as will cover them well ; heat it anew, and 
pour it on them again the following day ; and on the next 
throw them into it for a minute so soon as it boils, with plentf 
of tarragon in branches, a few very small silver onions, and 
salt and whole pepper in the same proportions as in the receipt 
above. It should be observed that the French vinegar, fiwa 



CHAP. XXII,] PICKLES. 503 

its superior excellence, will have a very different effect, in 
many preparations, to tbat which is made up for sale generally 
in England ; but unless it be at Mr. Beauty's, Lambeth, we 
know not where it can be procured genuine in this country. 

TO PICKLE PEACHES* 

Take, at their full growth, just before they begin to ripen, 
six large or eight moderate-sized peaches; wipe the down 
from them, and put them into brine that will float an egg. 
In three days let them be taken out, and drained on a sieve 
reversed for several hours. Boil in a quart of vinegar for ten 
minutes two ounces of whole white pepper, two of ginger 
-slightly bruised, a teaspoonful of salt, two blades of mace, 
half a pound of mustard-seed, and a half-teaspoonful of ca- 
yenne tied in a bit of muslin. Lay the peaches into a jar, and 
pour the boiling pickle on them : in two months they will be 
%t for use. 

Peaches, 6 or 8 : in brine 3 days. Vinegar, 1 quart ; whole 
white pepper, 2 ozs.; bruised ginger, 2 ozs.; salt, 1 tea- 
spoonful; mace, 2 blades; mustara-seed, ^ lb. : 10 minutes. 

Obs. — The peaches may be converted into excellent man- 
goes by cutting out from the stalk-end of each a round of 
-sufficient size to allow the stone to be extracted : this should 
be done after they are taken from the brine. They may be 
filled with veiy fresh mustard-seed, previously washed in a 
little vinegar ; to this a small portion of garlic, or bruised 
eschalots, cayenne, horse-radish, chilies (the most appropriate 
of any), or spice of any kind may be added, to the taste. The 
part cut out must be replaced, and secured with a packthread 
crossed over the fruit« 

TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS. 

Select for this purpose, if they can be procured, the smallest 
buttons of the wild or meadow mushrooms, in preference to 
those which are artificially raised, and let them be as freshly , 
gathered as possible. Cut the stems off quite close, and clean 
them with a bit of new flannel slightly moistened, and dipped 
in fine salt; throw them as they are done into plenty of 
spring-water, mixed with a large spoonful of salt, out drain 
tnem from it quickly afterwards, and lay them into a soft cloth 
to dry, or the moisture which hangs about them will too 
much weaken the pickle. For each quart of the mushrooms 
thus prepared, take nearly a quart of the palest white wine 
vinegar (this is far superior to the distilled vinegar generally 



504 MODERN COOKERY. [jCHAP, XXH. 

used for the pnrposey and the yamtion in the colour of the 
mushrooms will he very slight), and add to it a heaped tea- 
spoonful of salty half an ounce of whole white pepper, an 
ounce of ginger, sliced or lightly hruised, ahout the fourth of 
a ealtspoonful of cayenne, tied in a small hit of muslin, and 
two large hlades of mace ; to these may he added half a small 
nutmeg, sliced ; hut too much spice will oitirely overpower 
the fine natural flavour of the mushrooms. When the pickle 
hoils, throw them in, and hoil them in it over a clear fire mo- 
derately fast from six to nine minutes, or somewhat longer, 
should they Jiot he very small. When they are much dispro- 
portioned in size, the larger ones should have two minutes 
boil before the others are thrown into the vinegar. As soon 
as they are tolerably tender, put them at once into small stooe 
jars, or into warm wide-necKed bottles, and divide the spice 
equally amongst them. The following day, or as soon as 
they are perfectly cold, secure them from the air with large 
corks, or tie skins and paper over them. They should be 
stored in a dry place, and guarded from severe frost. When 
the colour of the mushrooms is more considered than the ex- 
cellence of the pickle, the distilled vinegar can be used for it. 
The reader may rely upon this receipt as a really good one ; 
vre have had it many times proved, and it is altogether our 
own. 

Mushroom-battons (without the stejcos), 2 quarts ; palest 
white wine vinegar, short ^ gallon ; salt, large dessertspoonful, 
or l^oz. ; white neppercoms, 1 oz.; whme ginger, 2ozs.; 
cayenne, small J saltspoonful ; 1 small nutmeg. 

MUSHBOOMS IN BBINE. 

I^or Winter use. (Very good,) 

We have had small mushrootn-buttons excellently preserved 
through the winter prepared as follows, and we therefore give 
the exact proportions which we had used for them, though the 
same quantity of brine would possibly allow of rather more 
mushrooms in it. Prepare them exactly as for the preceding 
pickle, and measure them a^er the stems are taken off. For 
each quart, boil together for five minutes two quarts of water, 
with half a pound of common, white salty 2^ small dessertspoonfbl 
of white peppercorns, a couple of blades; of mace, aM a rac» of 
ginger; take off the scum thoroughly, and throw in th^ mi^ 
rooms ; boil them gently for about five n^inutes, then pnVAem 
into well-warmed, wide-necked bottles>^ and let them beooine 
periectly cold, pour a little good saladroil on the Uffh «ork then

with new eorks, and tie bladder over, or coyer them with two 
separate bladders. When wanted for nse, soak the mushrooms 
in warm water till the brine is sufficiently extracted. 

Mushrooms, 1 quart; watar, | gallon; salt, I lb.; peppercorns, 
1 small deasertspoonfiil ; mace, 2 bisdes; ginger, 1 race': 5 minutes. 
Muahrooms, in brine, 5 miniites. 

TO FICKIJi WALKfJTS* 

The wahints for thk pickle most be gathered while a j»n 
can pierce them easily, for when once the shell can be felt, they 
haye ceased to be in a proper state for it. Make sufficient 
brine to cover them well, witn six ounces of salt to the gallon 
of water ; take off the scum, which will rise to the snr&ce as 
the salt dissolyes, throw in the walnuts, and slir them niffht and 
morning ; change the brine every three days, and if tney are 
wanted for immediate eating, leave them in it for twelve days; 
otherwise, drain them from it in nine, spread them on dishes, 
and let them remain earoosed to the air until they become black; 
this will be in twelve hours, or less. Make a {»ckle for them 
with something more than half a gallon of vinegar to the 
hundred, a teaapoonful of salt, two ounces of black pepper, three 
of bruised ginger, a drachm of mace, and from a quarter to half 
an ounee of cloves (of which some may be stuck into three or 
four small onions), and four ounces of mustard-seed. Boil the 
whole of these together for about five minutes ; have the 
walnuts ready in a stone jar, or jars, and pour it on them as it is 
taken from the fire. When the pickle is quite cold, cover the 
jar securely, and store it in a dry place. Keep the walnuts 
always well covered with the vinegar, and boil that which is 
added to them. 

Walnuts, 100 ; in brine made with 12 ozs. salt to 2 quarts 
water, and changed twice or more, 9 or 12 days. Vinegar, /iu^ 
A gaUcm; salt, 1 teaspoonful ; whole black pepper, 2 ozs.; 
ginger, 3 ozs. ; mace, 1 drachm; cloves, | to Joz. ; small onions, 
4 to 6 ; mustard-seed, 4 ozs. : 5 minutes. 

TO PICKIiE BEET-BOOT. 

Boil the beet-root tender by the directions of page 329, and 
when it is quite cold, pare ana slice it ; put it into a jar, and 
cover it with vinegar previously boiled and allowed to become 
again perfectly cold: it will soon be ready for use. It is 
;excellent when merely covered with x Chili vinegar. A few 
^all shalots may be bcHled in the j^ckle for it when their 
flavour is liked. 



60Q MODERN COOKERY. [|CHAP. XXIt. 

t 

To each quart vinegar, salt, 1 teaspoonM ; cayenne tied in 
muslin, J saltspoonAil, or white peppercorns, J to whole oz. 

PICKLED ESCHALOTS. 

For a quart of ready-i^ed eschalots, add to the same quan- 
tity of the hest pale white wine vinegar, a dessertspoonml of 
salt, and an ounce of whole white pepper; hring these quickly 
to a boil, take off the scum, throw in the escnalots, simmer 
them for two minutes only; turn them into a dean stone jar, 
and when they are quite, cold, tie a skin, or two folds of tmck 
paper over it. 

Eschalots, 1 quart; vinegar, 1 quart; salt, 1 dessertspoonftd; 
whole white pepper, 1 oz. 

06;. — The sooner the eschalots are pickled after they are 
ripe and dry, the better they will be. 

PICKLED OKIONS. 

Take the smallest onions that can be procured, just after they 
are harvested, for they are never in so good a state for the pur- 
pose as then; proceed, after having peeled them, exactly as for 
the eschalots, and when they begin to look clear, which will be 
in three or four minutes, put them into jars, and pour the 
pickle on them. The vinegar should be very pale, and their 
colour will then be exceedingly well preserved. Any £Eivouiite 
spices can be added to it 

TO PICKLE LEMONS, AND LIMES. (Excellent.^ 

Wipe eight fine sound lemons very clean, and make, at equal 
distances, four deep incisions in eaich, from the stalk to the 
blossom end, but without dividing the &uit; stuff them with as 
much salt as they will contain, lay them into a deep dish, and 
place them in a sunny window, or in some warm place for a 
week or ten days, keeping them often turned and basted vrith 
their own liquor; then rub them with some good pale turmeric, 
and put them with their juice, into a stone jar with a small 
head of garlic, divided into cloves and peeled, and a dozen small 
onions stuck with twice as many cloves. Boil in two quarts of 
white wine vinegar, half a pound of ginger lightly bruised, two 
ounces of whole ;black pepper, and half a pound of mustard- 
seed ; take them from the fire and pour them directly on the 
lemons ; cover the jar with a plate, and let them remain till the 
following da^, then add to the pickle half a dozen capsicums 
^9^^, ^®^ chUies, if more convenient), and tie a skin and a fold 
of thick paper over the jar. 




CHAP. XXII.] PICKLES, 507 

Large lemons stuffed with salt, 8: 8 to 10 days. Turmeric, 1 
to 2 0Z8. ; ginger, j lb.; mustard-seed, ^ lb.; capsicums, 6 ozs. 

Obs. — The turmeric and garlic may, we think, be omitted 
from this pidkle witii advantage. It will remain good for seven 
years if the lemons be kept well covered with vinegar; that 
which is added to them should be boiled and then left till cold 
before it is poured into the jar. The lemons will not be fit for 
table in less than twelve months; but if wanted for more im- 
mediate use, set them for one night into a cool oven after the 
bread is drawn ; they may then be eaten almost directly. 

Limes must have but slight incisions made in the rinds ; and 
they will be sufficiently softened in four or five days. Two 
ounces of salt only will be required for half a dozen; and all 
which remains unmelted must, with their juice, be put into the 
jar with them before the vinegar is poured on : this should be 
missed with spice and mustard-seed, and be boiling when it is 
added to the limes. 

TO PICKLE BABBEBBIES AND SIBEBIAN CBABS. 

When wanted for garnishing only, take the fruit before it is 
very ripe, cut htJf the length of their stalks from the crabs, and 
free the barberries from the leaves, and from any discoloured 
berries that may be amongst them. Put them into stone jars, 
and cover them well with brine, which has been boiled and left 
to become perfectly cold. Look at them occasionally during the 
winter, and shoidd any scum or mould have gathered on the sur- 
face, clear it well off, drain the brine closely from the fruit, and 
fill the jars with some that is freshly made. Six ounces of salt, 
and a morsel of alum half the size of a bean to the quart of 
water should be boiled together for ten minutes and well 
skimmed, both for the first brine, and for any that may be re- 
quired afterwards. 

To pickle these fruits in vinegar, add the alum to a sufficient 
quantity to cover them, and boil it with a few white pepper- 
corns, which must be strained out before it is poured mto the 
jars, it must be quite cold when added to the barberries or crabs; 
these last should not be ripe when they are used, or they will 
burst in the pickle; they should have attained their growtn and 
full colour, but be still hard.

when It is used for cakes or biscuits, it should be sparing^ 
added, and the sponge should be lefl twice the usual tinie to 
rise. This method will be fbund to answer equally with bnad. 
For example : should a couple of spoonsfiil of yeast be ordend 
in a receijit, when it is bitter, use but one, and let it stwad two

hours instead of half the time : the fermentation, though slow, 
will be quite as perfect as if it were more quickly effected, and 
the cake or loaf thus made will not heccnne dry by any means 
so soon as if a Jarger portion of yeast were mixed with it. 

All light cakes require a rather brisk oyen to raise and set 
them; very huge rich ones a well-sustained degree of heat 
sufficient to bake them through ; and small sugar-cakes a very 
slow oven, to prevent their taking a deep colour before they 
are half done : gingerbread too should be gently baked, unless 
it be of the hght thick kind. Meringues, macaroons, and 
ratafias, will bear a slight degree more of heat than these. 

For sponge and savoy cakes the French butter their moulds 
thickly, and shake fine sugar in them until they are equally 
covered with it : the loose sugar must be turned out before they 
are used. 

To ascertain whether a cake be done, thrust a knife into the 
centre, and should this come out clean draw it from the oven 
directly; but should the paste adhere to it, continue the baking. 
Several sheets of paper are placed usually under large plum- 
cakes. 

TO BLAirCH ALMONDS. 

Put them into a saucepan with plenty of cold water, and heat 
it slowly; when it is just scalding turn the almonds into a 
basin, peel, and throw th^n into cold water as they are done: 
dry ttea weU in a soft doth before they are used. J£ the 
water be too hot it will turn them yellow. 

TO roxTSj} almonhs. 

Almonds are more earaly pounded, and less liable to become 
oily, if dried a little in a very gentle degree of heat after they 
are blanched ; left for example, in a warm room for two or 
three days, lightly spread on a large dish or tin. They should 
be sprinkled during the beating with a few drops of cold water, 
or white of egg, or lemon-juice, and pounded to a smooth paste : 
this is more easily done, we believe, when they are first roughly 
chopped, but we prefer to have them thrown at once into the 
mortar. 

TO SEDUCE AliMONDS TO A PASTE. 

(7%e quickest andfiosiest way,) 

Chop them a little on a large and very clean trencher, then 
with a paste-roller (rolling-pin), which ought to be thicker in

ahnonds bv it» and absorbed by the board, we would recommend 
a marble slab for them in preferenoe, when it is at hand; and 
shoold Uftev be intended for a sweet dish, that some pounded 
sugar should be strewed under them. When a board or strong 
trencher is used, it should be rather higher in the middle than 
at the sides. 

TO COLOUS ALHONBS FOB CAKES, OE PASTBT. 

Blanch, dry, and chop them rather coarsely; pour a little 
prepared cochineal into the hands» and roll the almonds between 
them until they are equally qploured ; then spread them on a 
sheet of paper, and place them in a very gentle degree of heat 
to dry. Use spinage-juice (see page 306) to colour them green, 
and a strong infusion of saffiron to give them a yellow tint 
They have a pretty effect when striwed oyer the idn^ of tarts 
or cakes, e^^^ially the rose-coloured ones, which should be 
rather pale. 

TO PBEPABB BUTTBB FOB BICH CAKBS. 

For all large and yeiy rich cakes the usual directions are, to 
heat the btUter to a cream : but we find that they are quite as 
lif ht, if not moie so, when it is cut small and gently melted 
with just so much heat as will dissolye i^ and no more, if it be 
shaken round in a sauoeiian preyiously warmed, and held near 
the fire for a short time, it will soon be liquefied, which is all 
that is required : it must on no account be hot when it is added 
to the other inffredients, to which it must be poured in small 
portions after uiey are all mixed, in the wa^ which we haye 
minutely described in the lecd]^ for a M adora cake, and that 
of the Sutherland puddings (Chapter XYIH). To cream it, 
drain the water weU from it, after it is cut, soften it a little 
before the &re should it be yery hard, and then with the back 
of a laige strong wooden spoon beat it until it resembles thick 
cream. When prepared thus, the sugar is added to it first, and 
then the other ingredients in succession. 

TO WmSK EGGS FOB UGHT BICH CAKES. 

Break them one by one, and separate the yolks from the 
whites : this is done easily by pouring the yolk nt>m one half of 
the shell to the other, and letting the white drop from it into a 
basin beneath. With a amaU three-pronged fork take out the 
specks firom each ^g as it is broken, that none may accidentally 



CHAP, XXIII.] CAKES, 511 

escape notice. Wliisk the yolks until they appear light, and 
the whites until they are a quite solid froth ; wnile any liquid 
remains at the bottom of the bowl they are not sufficiently 
beaten : when a portion of them, taken up with the whisk, and 
dropped from it, remains standing in points, they are in the 
proper state for use, and should be mixed into the cake directly. 

OBANGE-riiOWBB MACABOONS. (DELICIOUS.) 

. Have ready two pounds of very dry white sifted sugar. 
Weigh two ounces of the petals of freshly-gathered orange- 
blossoms after they have been picked from the stems ; and cut 
them very small with' a pair of scissors into the sugar, as they 
will become discoloured if not mixed with it quickly after they 
are cut. When all are done, add the whites of seven eggs, and 
beat the whole well together till- it looks like snow ; then drop 
the mixture upon paper without delay, and send the cakes to a 
very cool oven. 

Pounded sugar, 2 lbs.; orange-blossoms, 2 ozs.; whites of 
eggs, 7 : 20 minutes, or more. 

Obs, — ^It is almost impossible to state with accuracy the pre- 
cise time required for these cakes, so much depends on the 
oven : they should be very delicately coloured, and yet dried 
through. 

ALMOND BIACASOONS. 

Blanch a pound of fresh Jordan almonds, wipe them dry, and 
set them into a very cool oven to render them perfectly so; 
pound them to an exceedingly smooth paste, with a little white 
of egg; then whisk to a firm solid froth the whites of seven 
eggs, or of eight, should they be small ; mix with them a pound 
and a half of the finest sugar; add these by degrees to the 
almonds, whisk the whole up wdl together, and drop the mix- 
ture upon wafer-paper, which may be procured at the confec- 
tioner's : bake them in a moderate oven a very pale brown. It 
is an improvement to the flavour of these cakes to substitute an 
ounce of bitter almonds for one of the sweet : they are some- 
times made with an equal weight of each ; and another variety 
of them is obtained by gently browning the almonds in a slow 
oyen before they are pounded. 

Jordan almonds blanched, 1 lb. ; sugar, 1 J lb. ; whites of 7 
or 8 eggs : 15 to 20 minutes.

stir lightly in with these four ounces of dry sifted flour, beat the 
mixture for about ten minutes, put it into small buttered patty-

teaspoonfnl of mace and dnnamon mixed, and the whites of 
three large ^gs ; roll the mixture into balls about the size of a 
huge marble and bake them on wafer-paper twenty minutes in

Obs. — ^When the flayour is not disliked, it will be found ao 
improvement to substitute an ounce of bitter almonds for one of 
the sweet ; and we prefer the whole of the almonds and cmdied 
peel also cut into spikes instead of being chopped : the ingre- 
dients must then be made into a lighter paste, and plaoei in 
amall heaps on the paper.

BITTSB ALMOND BISCUITS. 

Blanch, and then chop as fine as possible, two ounces of bit- 
ter aknonds, and add them to half a pound of flour, half a pound 
of sifted sugar, and two oun^ces of butter, previously well mixed 
together. Whisk tlje whites of a couple of eggs to a strong^ 
froth, beat them lightly to the other ingredients, drop the cakes 
on a buttered tin, or copper oven-leaf, and bake them rather 
slowly from ten to twelve minutes : they should be very small. 
Should the proportion of bitter almonds be considered unhealth- 
ful, use half as many, and substitute sweet ones for the re- 
mainder. 

Flour, i lb. ; sugar, I lb. ; butter, 2 ozs. ; bitter almonds, 2 
ozs. ; whites of eggs, 2 : slow oven, 10 to 12 minutes. 

FINE AJMOim CAKE. 

Blanch, dry, and pound to the finest possible paste, eight 
ounces of fresh Jordan almonds, and one ounce of bitter; 
moisten them with a few drops of cold water or white of egg, to 
prevent their oiling ; then mix with them, very gradually twelve 
fresh ^gs which have been whisked until they are exceedingly 
light ; throw in by degrees one pound of fine, dry, sifted sugar, 
and keep the mixture light by constant beating, with a large 
wooden spoon, tis the separate ingredients are added. Mix in 
bv degrees three quarters of a pound of dried and sifted flour of 
the best qualitv ; then pour gently from the sediment a pound 
of butter which has been just mefted, but not allowed to become 
hot, and beat it very gradually, but very thoroughly, into the 
cake, letting one portion entirely disappear before another is 
thrown in : add the rasped or finely-grated rinds of two sound 
fresh lemons, fill a thickly-buttered mould rather more than 
half frdl with the mixture, and bake the cake from an hour and 
a half to two hours in a well-heated oven. Lay paper over the 
top when it is sufficiently coloured, and guard carefully agamst 
it being burned.

POUND CAKE. 

Mix, as directed in the foi^oing receipt, ten eggs (some cooks 
take a pound in weight of wese)) one pound of sugar, one of 
flour, and as much of butter. A ff lass oi brandy and a pound <^ 
currants may be added very gra^ially just before the cake is 
put into the oven, with any spice that is liked; and two or three 
ounces of candied orange or lemon-rind, sliced thin, or an ounce 
of carraway seeds, may supply the place of alL A cake made 
with half the quantity or the ingredients must be baked one 
hour. 

BICE CAKE. 

Take six eg^ with their weight in fine sugar, and in butter 
also, and half nieir weight of flour of rice, and half of wheaten 
flour; make the cake as directed for the Madeira or almond 
cake, but throw in the rice after the flour : then add the butter 
in the usual way, and bake the cake about an hour and ten mi- 
mutes. Give any flavour that is liked. The butter may be 
altogether omitted. This is a moderate-sized cake. 

Eggs, in the shell, 6 ; their weight in butter and in sugar ; 
half as much flour of rice, and the same of wheaten flour : I 
hour, 10 minutes. 

WHITE CAKE. 

Beat half a pound of fresh butter to a cream, add to it an 
equal weight of dried and sifted sugar, the yolks and whites of 
eight eggs, separately whisked, two ounces of candied orange- 
peel, half a teaspoomul of mace, a glass of brandy, one pound of 
flour strewed in by degrees, and last of fJl a pound and a quarter 
of currants. Directly it is mixed send the cake to a well-heated 
oven, and bake it for a couple of hours. Four ounces of beaten 
almonds are sometimes added to it. 

Butter, i lb. ; sugar, i lb. ; eggs, 8 ; mace, } teaspoonfiil ; 
brandy, 1 wineglassful ; flour, 1 lb. ; candied-peel, 2 ozs. ; cur-

A GOOD SPONGE CAKE. 

Kasp on some lumps of well-refined sugar the rind of a fine 
sound lemon, and scrape ofi'the part whicn has imbibed the es- 
sence, or crush the plums to powder, and add them to as much more 
as will make up the weight of eight or ten fresh eggs in the shell ; 



break these one by one, and separate the whites m)m the yolks; 
beat the latter in a large bowl for ten minutes, then strew in the

sngar gTadiiaIly,''and beat them well together. In the mean time 
let the whites be whisked to a quite soUd froth, add them to the 
yolks, and when they are well blended sift and stir the flour 
gently to them, but do not beat it into the mixture ; pour the 
cake into a well-buttered mould, and bake it an hour and a 
quarter in a moderate oven. 

Kasped rind, 1 large lemon ; j&esh eggs, 8 or 10; their weight 
of dry, sifted sugar; and half their weight of flour : baked, li 
hour, moderate oven. 

A SMALLER SPONGE CAKE. 

(Very good,) 

Five full-sized eggs, the weight of four in sugar, and of 
nearly three in flour, will make an exceedingly good cake : it 
may be flavoured, like the preceding one, with lemon-rind, or 
with bitter almonds, vanilla, or confected orange-blossoms re- 
duced to powder. An hour will bake it thoroughly. All the 
ingredients for sponge cakes should be of good quahty, and the 
sugar and flour should be dry; they should also be passed 
through a fine sieve kept expressly for such purposes. The 
excellence of the whole depends much on the manner in which 
the e^s are whisked ; this should be done as lightly as possible ; 
but it is a mistake to suppose that they cannot be too long beaten, 
as after they are brought to a state of perfect firmness they are 
injured by a continuation of the whisking, and will at times 
cardie, or render a cake heavy from this cause. 

A SPONGE CAKE. 

{Good and quickly made,) 

'' Beat together for between twenty and thirty minutes, the 
yolks of nine and the whites of five fresh eggs ; then by degrees 
add three quarters of a pound of sugar, and six and a hm of 
flour. Flavour it or not, at choice, with the grated rind of a 
lemon, and bake it an hour, or rather more, in a brisk oven. 

A GOOD MADEIRA CAKE. 

Whisk four fresh eggs until" they are as light as possible, 
then, continuing still to whisk them, throw in by slow degrees 
the following ingredients in the order in which they are written :• 
six ounces of diy, pounded, and sifted sugar ; six of flour, also 
dried and sifted ; four ounces of butter just dissolved, but not 
heated; the rind of a fresh lemon ; and the instant before the 
cake is moulded, beat well in the third of a teaspoonfrd of 
carbonate of soda: bake it an hour in a moderate oven. In

larly that each poition of hntter must be bei^en into the mix- 
tnie nntU no appearance of it remains before the next m added ; 
and if ibia be done, and the preparation be kept light by con- 
stant and light whisking, the cake will be as ^[ood, if not better, 
than if the butter were creamed. Candied citron can be added 
to tibe paste, but it jb not needed.

BAITBUBT CAK£8. 

First, mix well tocher a pound of currants, cle»ied with 
great nicety and dried, a quarter-pound of beef-suet, finely 
minced, three ounces each of candied orange and lemon-rind, 
shred small, a few grains of salt, a full quarter-ounce of pounded 
cinnamon and nutmeg mixed, and four ounces of macaroons or 
ratafias rolled to powder. Next, make a light paste with four- 
teen ounces of butter to the pound of flour ; give it an extra 
turn or two to prevent its rising too much in the oven ; roll 
out one half in a very thin square, and spread the mixed firuit 
and spice equally upon it ; moisten the ed^es, lay on the re- 
nuuning half of the paste, rolled equally thm, press die edges 
securely together, mark the whole with the back of a knife in 
regular divisions of two inches wide and three in length ; bake 
the pastry in a well-heated oven from twenty-five to thirty 
minutes, and divide it into cakes while it is still warm. They 
may be served as a second course dish either hot or cold, an^ 
may be glazed at pleasure. 

Currants, 1 lb. ; beef-suet, 4 ozs. ; candied orange and lemon- 
rind each, 3 ozs.; salt, small pinch ; mixed spices, i oz. ; maca- 
roons or ratafias, 4 ozs. : baked 25 to 30 minutes. 



MEiuarGnES. 

Beat to a very solid froth the 'whites of aix fresh eggs, and 
have ready to mix with them half a pound of the best sogar, 
well^ diiea and sifted. Ijay some squares or long atiipi of 
writing-paper closely upon a board, which ou^ht tobe an inch 
thick to prevent the meringues fitim leceiying any •colour 
from the bottom of the oven. When all is ready for them, itir

the sogar to the beaten ^ggs, and with a table or dessert spoon 
lay the mixture on the paper in the form of a half egg ; toft 
sugar quickly over, blow oft' all that does not adhere, and set the 
meringues unmediately into a moderate oven : the process must 
be expeditious, or the sugar melting will cause the meringues 
to spread^ instead of retaining then* shape. When they are 
coloured a light brown, and are firm to the touch, draw them 
out, raise them from the paper, and press bock the insides with 
a teaspoon, or scoop them out so as to leave space enough 
to admit some whipped cream or preserve, with which 
they are to be filled, when cold, before they are served. Put 
them again inta the oven to dry gently, and when they 
are ready for table &sten them togeUter in the shape of a 
whole egg, and pile them lightly on a napkin for th^ second 
course. 

Whites of fresh eggs, 6 ; sifted sugar, | lb. 

Obs, — ^Four ounces of pounded almonds may be mixed with 
the ^gs and sugar for these cakes, and any flavour added to 
them at pleasure. If well made they are remarkably good and 
elegant in appearance. They must be fastened together with a 
little white of egg. 



THICK, LIGHT GINGESBBBiJD. 

Crumble down very small eight ounces of butter into a couple 
of pounds of flour, then add to, and mix thoroughly with them, 
half a pound of good brown sugar, two ounces of powdered 
ginger, and half an ounce of ground carraway-seeds ; beat gra- 
dually to these, first two pounds of treade, next three well- 
whisked eggs, and last of aU half an ounce of carbonate of soda, 
dissolved in a very small cupM of warm water ; stir the whole 
briskly together, pour the nlixture into very shallow tins, put it 
immediatelv into a moderate oven, and bake it for an hour and 
a half. The gingerbread made thus will be remarkably light 
and good. For children part of the spice and butter may be 

omitted.

soda would be sufficient for this giugerbread, for with the whole 
quantity it rises in the oven to three times its height, and is apt

to run over the tops of the tins even when they are but half 
filled with it at first. 

GOOD COMMON GINOEBBKBAB. 

Work yeiy smoothly six ounces of firesh butter (or some that 
has been well washed from the salt, and wrung dry in a doth) 
into one pound of fiour, and mix with them thoroughly an ounce 
of ginger in fine powder, four ounces of brown sugar, and half s 
teaspoonful of beaten cloves and mace. Wet these with three- 
quarters of a pound, or rather more, if needM, of cold treacle; 
roll out the paste, cut the cakes with a round tin cutter, lay 
them on a floured or buttered baking tin, and put them into a 
very slow oven. Lemon-grate, or candied peel can be added, 
when it is liked.

with half a pound of sugar and three quarters of an ounce of 
ginger. When the paste is quite cold, roll it out with as much 
flour as will prevent its adhering to the board : bake the cakes 
in a very gentle oven. 

COCOA-NUT GINGEBBBEAD. 

Mix well together ten ounces of fine wheaten flour, and 
six of flour of rice (or rice ground to powder), the grated rind of 
a lemon, and three quarters of an ounce of ginger ; pour nearly 
boiling upon these a pound of treade, five ounces of heat 
butter, and five of sugar, melted together in a saucepan ; best 
the mixture, which will be almost' a batter, with a wooden 
spoon, and when quite smooth leave it till it is perfectly odd, 
then add to it five ounces of grated cocoa-nut, and when it is 
thoroughly blended with the other ingredients, lay the paste in 
small heaps upon a buttered tin, and bake them in a very slack 
oven from half to three quarters of an hour.

sugar and two of ginger, in fine powder, and knead them into a 
stS paste, with new mUk. RoU it thin, cut out the biscuits 
with a cutter, and bake them in a slow oven until they are crisp 
quite through, but keep them of a pale colour. A couple ol 
^ggs are sometimes mixed with the milk for them, but are no 
material improvement; an additional ounce of sugair ma^ be 
used when a sweeter biscuit is liked. To make good ginffei 
ealfes, increase the butter to six ounces, and the su|^ to eight, 
for each pound of flour, and wet the ingredients mto a paste 
with eggs: a little lemon-grate will give it an agreeable 
flavour.

and work it lightly mto crumbs, then add three quarters of a 
pound of sifted sugar, a dessertspoonful of pounded dnnamoa 
(or half as much when only a slight flavour is liked), and 
make these ingredients into a firm paste with three e^ or 
four, if needed. Boll it, not very thin, and cut oat the cakes 
with a tin shape. Bake them in a ^rery gentle oyen from 
fifteen to twenty minutes, or longer, should they not he done 
quite through. As soon as they are ooldf put them into a clean 
and dry tin canister, a precaution which should be obserred 
with all small sugar cakes, which ought also to be loosoied

ing for the cinnamon the rasped or grated rinds of two lemons, 
and the strained juice of one, when its acidity is not objected to. 
ISlore butter, and more or less of sugar, can be used at will, both 
for these and for the cinnamon cakes«

A GOOD UGHT BITN. 

Break quite small three ounces of good butter into a pound 
and a quarter of flour, stir into the middle of these a spoonful 
and a quarter of solid, well-purified yeast, mixed with some- 
thing more than a quarter-piiit of warm milk, and leave it to 
rise before, bat not dose to the fire, for an hour, or longer, 
should it not then appear extremely hght Add to three ^gs, 
properly whisked, a &w spoonsful of warm milk, strain and 
beat them to the bun ; next, mix with it six ounces of pale 
farown sugar, six of well-cleaned currants, and the grated rind 
of a small lemon, or some nutmeg, if preferred ; or, in lieu of 
either, slice into it an ounce and a hali of candied orange-rind. 
Let it again rise for an hour, then beat it up lightly with a 
wooden spoon, put it into a buttered pan, and bake it in a brisk 
oven for nearly or quite an hour. An additional ounce of

COCOA-NUT BIBCUIX. 

With a pound of flour mix three ounces of a sound fresh 
cocoa-nut, rasped on a fine grater ; make a leaven as for the 
bun in the foregoing receipt, with a large tablespoonfiil of good 
yeast, and about the thira of a pint of warm new milk ; let it 
stand for an hour, then strew over and mix well up with it four 
ounces of pounded sugar; next, dissolve two ounces of butter in 
a very little milk, cool it down witE a few spooned of cold 
milk if needful, and pour it to a couple of well-whisked eggs; 
with these wet the otner ingredients into a very light dough, let 
it stand from three quarters of an hour to an hour, and bake it 
about the same time in a rather quick oven. Two ounces more 
of sugar, one of butter, and two of candied orange-rind, sliced 
thin, will convert this into a good eakej the cocoa-nut imparting 
great richness as well as flavour to the mixture : the proportion 
of this can also be regulated by the taste, after the first trial.

THBSASflBEDLB STREET BISCUITS. 

Mix with a conple of pounds of sifted flour of the very best 
quality, three ounces of good butter, and work it into the 
smallest possible crumbs ; add four ounces of fine, dry, siffced 
sugar, and make them into a firm paste with new milk; beat 
thu forcibly for some minutes with the rolling-pin, and when it 
is extremely smooth roll it the third of an inch thick, cut it with 
a small square cutter, and bake the biscuits in a yery slow oven 
until they are crisp to the centre: no part of them should 
remain soft. Half a teaspoonM of carbonate of soda is said to 
improye them, but we haye not put it to the test. Carraway-

A GALETTE. 

The galette is a fayourite cake in France, and may be made 
rich, and comparatiyely delicate, or quite common, by using 
more or less butter for it, and by augmenting or diminishing the 
size. Work lightly three quarters of a pound of good batter 
into a pound of flour, add a large saltspoonful of salt, and nu^e 
these into a paste with the yolks of a couple of eggs mixed with 
a small cup of ^ood cream, should it be at hand ; if not, with 
water ; roll this into a complete round, three quarters of an inch 
thick ; score it in small diamonds, brush yolk of egg oyer the 
top, and bake the galette for about half an hour in a tolerably 
brisk oyen ; it is usually eaten hot, but is seryed cold also. An 
ounce of sifted sugar is sometimes added to it.

FLEEB OB FLEAS CAKES. 

These are veiy much served as a tea-cake at the tahles of the 
superior order of Kentish farmers. For the mode of making 
them, proceed as for flead-crust (see Chapter XVI.) ; cut the 
cakes small with a roimd cutter, and leave them more than half 
an inch thick ; if well made they will rise much in the oven. 
Bake them in a moderate but not slow oven. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; fiead, 1^ lb. ; butter, 6 ozs. : baked 10 to 15

GOOD GAPTAI1I*S BISCUITS. 

Make some fine white flour into a smooth paste with new 
milk ; divide it into small balls ; roll, and afterwards pull them 
vnth the fingers as thin as possible ; prick them all over, and 
bake them m a somewhat brisk oven from ten to twelve 
minutes. 

THE colonel's BISCUITS. 

Mix a slight pinch of salt with some fine sifted flour ; make it 
into a very smooth paste with good cream, and bake the biscuits 
gently, after having prepared them for the oven like those 
which precede. Store them as soon as they are cold in a dry 
canister, to preserve them crisp : they are excellent. 

AUIVT CHABLOTTE's BISCUITS. 

These biscuits, which are very simple and wholesome, may 
be made with the same dough as good white bread, with the 
addition of from half to a whole ounce of butter to the pound 
kneaded into it after it has risen. Break the butter small, 
spread out the dough a Uttle, knead it in well Wd equally, and 
leaye it for about half an hour ; then roll it a quarter of an inch 
thick; prick it well all over; cut out the biscuits; and bake 
them in a moderate oven from ten to fift;een minutes: they 
should be crisp quite through, but not deeply coloured. 

White-bread dough, 2 lbs. ; butter, 1 to 2 ozs. : to rise i hour. 
Baked in moderate oven 10 to 15 minutes. 

Obs. — To make the biscuits by themselves, proceed as for 
Bordyke bread ; but use new milk for them, and work three 
ounces of butter into two pounds of flour before the yeast is 
added.

For candymg, &c.: sugar, 6 lbs.; water, 2} pints: 5 to 10

TO BOIL SUGAB FROM STSUF TO CANJOT, OR TO CASAMEL. 

The technicalities by which confectioners distinguish the dif- 
ferent degrees of sugar-boiling, seem to us calculated rather to 
puzzle tluin to assist the reader; and we shall, therefore, confine 
oursdves to such plain English terms as may suffice, we hope, 
to explain them. After haying boiled a certain time, the length 
of which will in a measure depend upon the quality of the sugar 
as wdl as the quantity of water added, it becomes a thin syrup, 
and it will scarcely form a short thread if a drop be pressed 
between the thumb and finger and they are then drawn apart; 
from five to ten minutes more of rapid boiling will bring it to a 
thick syrup, and when this degree is reached the thread may be 
drawn from one hand to the otner at some length without break- 
ing; but its appearance in dropping firom the skimmer will per- 
haps best denote its being at this point, as it hangs in a sort of 
string as it fiJls. After this the sugar will soon begin to whiten, 
and to form large bubbles in the pan, when, if it be intended 
for barley-sugar, or caramel, some lemon-juice or other add 
must be added to it, to prevent its graining or becoming sugar 
again ; but if wanted to candy, it must be stirred without ceas- 
ing until it rises almost to the top of the pan, in one large white 
mass, when it must be used immediately or ladled out into 
pax)er cases or on to dishes, with the utmost expedition, as it. 
passes in an instant almost from this state to one in which it 
forms a sort of powder, which will render it necessary to add 
water, to stir it until dissolved, and to reboil it to the proper 
point. For barley-sugar likewise it must be constantly stirred, 
and carefiilly watched after the lemon-juice is added. A small 
quantity should be dropped from time to time into a large basin 
of oM water by those who are inexperienced in the ^cess ; 
when in fidling into this it makes a bubbling noise, and if taken 
out immediately after it snaps dean between the teeth without 
sticking to them, it must be poured out instantly : if wanted for 
sugar-spinning, the pan must be plunged as quickly as possible 
into a vessd of cold water. 

BAKUnr-SUGAS. 

Add to three poundsof highly-refined sugar one pint and a 



526 MODERN COOKERY. QcHAP. XXIT. 

quarter of spring water, with suffident wlute of egg to clarify it 
in the manner directed in the last receipt bat one; pour to it, 
when it begins to whiten and to be very thick, a dessertspoonful 
of the strained juice of a fresh lemon ; and boil it quickly till it 
is at the point which we have indicated above. A few drops of 
essence of lemon may be added to it, just as it is taken from the 
fire. Pour it on to a marble slab, or on to a shallow dish whicli 
has been slightly oiled, or rubbed with a morsel of fresh butter; 
and when it begins to harden at the edges form it into sticks, 
lozenges, balls, or any other shapes at pleasure. While it is 
still hquid it may be used for various purposes, such as Chan- 
tilly baskets, palac# bonbons, des croques-en-boucfies* cerises au 
caramel, &c: for these the vessel containing it must be set into 
a pan of water, and it must again be liquefi^ with a very gentle 
degree of heat should it cool too quickly. As it soon di^lyes 
if exposed to damp, it should be put into very dry canisters as 
soon as it is cold, and these should be kept in a dry place. 

Best sugar, 3 lbs.; water, 1 J pint; white of egg, i of 1 ; lemon- 
juice, 1 dess^tspoonful. 

GINGER CAin>T. 

Break a pound of highly-refined sugar into lumps, put it into 
a preserving pan, and pour over it about the thiid of a pint of 
spring water; let it stand until the sugar is nearly dissolved, 
then set itover a perfectly clear fire, andl^il it until it becomes a 
thin syrup. Have ready in a large cup a teaspoonful of the very 
best gmger in powder, mix it smoothly and gradually with two 
or three spoonsful of the syrup, and then stir it well into the 
whole. Watch the mixture carefully, keep it stirred, and drop 
it often from a spoon to ascertain the exact point of boiling it has 
reached. When it begins to fall in flakes, throw in the fipeshly- 
grated rind of a very large lemon, (k of two small ones, and 
work the sugar round quickly as it is added. The candy must 
now be stirred constantly until it is done: this will be when it 
falls in a mass from the spoon, and does not sink when placed 
in a small heap on a dish. It must be poured, or laded oat, as 
expeditiouslv as possible when ready, or it will fall quite into 
powder. If this should happen, a little water must be added to 
It, and it must be reboiled to the proper point The candy, if 
dropped in cakes upon cold dishes, may be moved off witbont

ORANGE-FLOWXS CANDT. 

Beat in three quarters of a pint, or rather more, of water, 
about the fourth part of the wnite of an egg ; and pour it on 
two pounds of the best sugar broken into lumps. Wnen it has 
stood a little time, place it oyer a yery clear fire, and let it boil 
for a few minutes, then set it on one side, until the scum has 
subsided; clear it off, and boil the sugar till it is very thick, 
then strew in by degrees three ounces of tne petals of the orange- 
blossom, weighed aner they are picked from their stems. Con- 
tinue to stir the candy until it rises in one white mass in the 
pan, then pour it into small paper cases, or on to dishes, and 
loUow for it precisely the same directions as are given for the 
ginger-candy in the preceding receipt. The oranse-flowers wUl 
turn brown if thrown too soon into the syrup : it should be more 
than three parts boiled when they are added. They must be 
gathered on the day they are wanted for use, as they become 
soon discoloured from keeping.

{Another Receipt,) 

The French, who are yery fond of the delicious flayour of the 
orange-blossom, leaye the petals In the candy; but a more deli- 
cate confection, to English taste, is made as follows : — Throw 
the orange-flowers into the syrup when it has boiled about ten 
minutes, and after they haye simmered in it for fiye more, pour 
the whole out, and leaye them to infuse until the following day, 
or eyen longer, if more conyenient; then bring* the syrup to 
the point of boiling, strain it from the blossoms through a 
muslm, and finish it by the foregoing receipt.

the sugar that adheres to it, cut it into inch-squares, stick these

them into liquid barley-su^r, and place them on a dish rubbed 
^th the smallest possible quantity of yery pure salad oil.

Put into a brass skillet, if at hand, three oimoes of very 
fresh butter, and as soon as it is, just melted add a ponna 
of brown sugar of moderate qiiality; keep these stirred 
gently over a very clear fire for about fifteen minutes, or 
until a little of the mixture, dropped into a basin of cold 
vrater, breaks clean between the teeth without sticking to 
them : when it is boiled to this point, it must be poured oat

added when the toffie is half done, improves it muc^ ; or a 
small teaspoonftil of powdered ginger, moistened with a little 
of the other ingredients, as soon as the sugar is dissolved, and 
then stirred to tne whole, will vary it pleasantly to many tastes,

larger proportion of butter, but it is the less wholesome on that 
very account. If dropped upon dishes first rubbed with a

way, and strawberries also. The fruit should be gently stiired 
with a spoon when it is seired. Each variety must be picked 
with great nicety from the stalks. The brandy would, we 
think, be less to the general taste in this country than the wine.

BLACK CAPS PAS EXCEIXENCS. 

Cut a dozen fine Korfolk biffins in two without paring them, 
scoop ont the cores, and fill the cavities with thin strips of fresh 
lemond-rind and with candied orange-peel. Coyer tne bottom 
of a fiiat shallow tin with a thick layer of fine pale brown sugar^ 
press the two halves of each apple together, and place them 
closely in the tin ; pour half a bottle of raisin or of any other 
sweet wine over them, and be careful to moisten the tops of all ; 
sift white sugar thickly on them, and set the tin into a very hot 
oven at first, that the outsides of the apples may catch or become 
black ; then draw them to the mouth of the oven, and bake them 
gently tiU they are soft quite through : they will resemble a 
lich sweetmeat when done, and will remain good for many days. 
The Norfolk biffin answers for this dish far better than any 
other kind of apple, but the winter queening, and some few firm 
sorts beside, can be used for it with fair success. These for 
variety may be cored without beiag divided, and filled with 
orange mannalade. The black caps served hot, as a second 
conrse dish, are excellent. 

Norfolk biffins, 12; rinds fresh lemons, 1 to 2; candied 
orange-rind, 2 to 3 ozs.; pale brown sugar, fib.; raisin or other 
vdne, i bottle; little sifted sugar : f to 1 hour, or more. J 

NOBMAKDY PIPPINS. 

To one pound of the apples, put one quart of water and six 
ounces of sugar ; let them simmer gently ror three hours, or more 
should they not be perfectly tender. A few strips of fresh lemon- 
peel and a very few cloves are by some persons considered agree- 
able additions to the syrup. 

Dried Normandy pippins, 1 lb. ; water, 1 quart ; sugar, 6 ozs. : 
3 to 4 hours. 

Obs. — ^These pippins, if stewed with care, will be converted

with or without wine. A utde eiperienoe will teadi the cook 
the exact quantity of liquid and of sugar which they require. 

BAKED COMPOTE OF AFFILES. 

(Our Utile ladtfs receipt) 

Fut into a wide Nottingham jar, with a cover, two quarts of 
golden pippins, or of the small apple which resembles them in 
appearance, called the orange pippm (this is very plentiful in 
the county of Kent), pared and cored, but without being divided; 
strew amongst them some small strips of very thin fresh lemon- 
rind, and throwjon them, nearly at the top, half a pound of very 
good Lisbon sugar, and set the jar, with the cover tied on, for 
some hours, or for a night, into a very slow oven. The apples 
will be extremely good, if not too qmckly baked : they should 
remain entire, but be perfectly tender, and clear in appearance. 
Add a little lemon-juice when the season is far advanced. 

Apples, 2 quarts; rind, quite small lemon; sugar, | lb.: 1 
night in slow oven ; or some hours baking in a very gentle one. 

Ohs, — These apples ' may be served hot or cold for a second 
course dish; or they will answer admirably to fill Gabrielles 
pudding. 

TO BAKE FEABS. 

Wipe some large sound iron pears, arrange them on a dish 
with the stalk end upwards, put them into the oven after the 
bread is drawn, and let them remain all night. If. well baked, 
they will be excellent, very sweet, and juicy, and much finer in 
flavour than those wluch are stewed or baked with sugar : the 
bon chrelien pear also is delicious baked thus. 

STEWED FEABS. 

Pare, cut in halves, and core a dozen fine iron pears, put them 
into a dose shutting stewpan with some thin strips of lemon- 
rind, half a pound of sugar, in lumps, as much water as will 
nearly coyer them, and should a veiy bright colour be desired, a 
dozen grains of cochineal, bruised, and tied in a muslin ; stew the 
fruit as gently as possible, from four to six hours, or longer, 
should it not be very tender. The Chaumontd pear, which 



CHAP. XXY.^ DESSERT DISHES. 533 

sometimes falls in large quantities before it is ripe, is excellent, 
if first baked until tolerably tender, and then stewed in a thin 
syrup. 

BOILED CHESTNUTS. 

Make a slight incision in the outer skin only of each chest- 
nut, to prevent its bursting, and when all are done, throw them 
into plenty of boiling water, with about a dessertspoonful of salt 
to the half gallon. Some chestnuts will require to be boiled 
nearly or quite an hour, others little more than hidf the time; 
the cook should try them occasionally, and as soon as they are 
soft through, drain them, wipe them in a coarse doth, and send 
them to table quickly in a hot napkin. 

BOASTED CHESTNUTS. 

The best mode of preparing. these is to roast them, as in 
Spain, in a coffee-roaster, after having first boiled them fix>m 
five to seven minutes, and wiped them dry. They should not 
be allowed to cool, and will require but from ten to fifteen 
minutes roasting. They may, when more convenient, be 
finished over the fire as usual, or in a Dutch or common oven, 
but in all cases the previous boihng will be found an improve- 
ment. Never omit to cut the rind of each nut slightly before 
it is cooked. Serve the chestnuts very hot in a napkin, and 
send salt to table with them.

it thonmghlv: pour it into a deliestely deui stone pitcher, or 
into large cnina jugs, throw a folded doth over and let it re* 
main until the morrow ; put it into pint or half-pint bottles, 
and cork them lightly with new velvet corks; for if these be 
pressed in tightly at first, the bottles would be liable to burst : 
in four or five days they may be closely corked, and stored in 
a dry and cool place. Damp destroys the colour and injures 
the flavour of these fine fruit-vin^ars ; of which a spoonful or 
two in a glass of water afibrds so agreeable a summer beverage, 
and one which, in manv cases of illnees, is so acceptable to in- 
Talids. They make also most admirable sauces for Her 
Mi^jest/s pudding, common custard, batter, and various other 
simple and sweet light puddings. 

Strawberries (sUiked), 4 lbs.; vinegar, 3 quarts: 3 to 4 
days. Yine^ dnuned and poured on fi^h strawberries, 4 lbs. : 
3 days. Dramed again on to fresh fruit, 3 to 4 lbs. : 2 to 4 days. 
To eadi pound of the vinegar, 1 lb. of highly-refined sugar: 
booled 5 nunutes. Lightly corked, 4 or 5 days. 

Oba, — ^Where there ]a a garden the fruit may be thrown into 
the vin^ar as it ripens, within an interval of forty-eight hours, 
instead of being aU put to infuse at once, and it must then re- 
main in it a proportionate time : one or two days in addition to 
that specified will make no difference to the preparation. The 
enamelled German stewpans are the best possible vessels to boil 
it in ; but it may be simmered in a stone jar set into a pan of 
boihng water when there is nothing more appropriate at nand ; 
though the syrup does not usually keep so well when this last 
method is adopted. 

Raspberries and strawberries mixed will make a vinegar of 
very pleasant flavour ; black currants also will afford an ex* 
ceedingly useful syrup of the same kind. 

STRAWBEBBT ACID ROYAL. 

Dissolve in a quart of spring water two ounces of citric acid, 
and pour it on as many quite ripe and richly-flavoured straw- 
berries, stripped from their stalks, as it will just cover; in 
twenty-four hours drain the liquid doselv from the fruit, and 
pour on it as much more ; keep it in a cool place, and the next 
day drain it again entirely from the fruit, and boil it gently for 
three or four minutes, witn its weight of veiy fine sugar, which 
should be dissolved in it before it is placed over the fire. It 
should be boiled, if possible, in an enamelled stewpan. When 
perfectly cold put it into small dry bottles for use, and store it 
in a cool but not damp place. It is one of the most delicate and

delidously flavoured prepanitioiis possible, and of beantifiil 
colour. If allowed to remain longer than the eight-and-forty 
hours before it is boiled, a brisk fermentation will commence. 
It must be well secured from the air when stored. 

Water, 1 quart ; citric add, 2 ozs. ; strawberries, 2 to 3 lbs. : 
24 hours. Same quantity of fruit : 24 hours. Equal weight 
of sugar and this liquid : 3 to 4 minutes at the utmaist, 

VERY FINE RASPBERBT VINEGAR. 

Fill fflass jars, or large wide-necked bottles, with very ripe 
but penectly sound, freshly gathered raspberries, fr^ed from their 
stalks, and cover them with pale white wine vinegar : they may 
be left to infuse from a week to ten days without injury, or the 
vinegar may be poured from them in lour and five, when more 
convenient. Afrer it is drained off, turn the fruit into a sieve 
placed over a deep dish or bowl, as the juice will flow slowly 
frx>m it for many nours ; put fresh ra^berries into the bottles, 
and pour the vinegar back upon them ; two or three days later 
change the fruit again, and when it has stood the same space of 
time, drain the whole of the vinegar from it, pass it through a 
jelly-bag, or thick linen doth, and boil it gently for ..four or 
five minutes with its weight of good sugar roughly powdered, 
or a pound and a quarter to the exact pint, and be very carefol 
to remove the scum entirely, as it rises. On the following day 
Ijottle the syrup, observing the directions which we have given 
for the strawbory vinegar. When the fruit is scarce it may be 
changed twice only, and left a few days longer in the vin^ar. 

Baspberries, 6 lbs. ; vinegar, 9 pints : 7 to 10 days. Vinq^si 
drained on to fresh raspberries (6 lbs. of) : 3 to 5 days. Poured 
again on fresh raspberries, 6 lbs.: 3 to 5 days. Boiled 5 
minutes with its weight of sugar. 

Ohs, — ^When the process of sugar-boiling is well understood, 
it will be found an improvement to boil that which is used for 
luspberry or strawberry vinegar to candv height before the 
liquid is mixed with it ; aUthe sciun mav then be removed with 
a couple of minutes simmering, and the flavour of the fruit 
will be more perfectly preserved. For more particular direc- 
tions as to the mode of proceeding, the chapter of confectifRiaiy 
may be consulted.

mixture into a new and well-scalded stone pitcher, or jar, make

added to the barley is an infinite improvement ; but as lemon- 
rind is often extremely unpalatable to invalids, their taste 
should be consulted before that ingredient is added, as it should 
be also for the degree of sweetness that is desired. After the 
barley-water has been poured off once, the jug may be filled a 
second time with boiling water, and even a third time with ad- 
vantage. 

RAISIN WINE. 

(Which, if long kept, really resembles foreign,) 

First boil the water which is to be used for the wine, and let 
it again become perfectly cold; then put into a sound sweet cask 
eight pounds of fine Malaga raisins for each gallon that is to be 
used, takiog out only the quite large stalks; me fruit and water 
may be put in alternately until the cask is full, the raisins being 
well pressed down in it ; lay the bung lightly over, stir the 
wine every day or two, and keep it full by the addition of water 
that has, like the first, been boiled, but which must always be 
quite cold when it is iised. So soon as the fermentation has 
enjbirely ceased, which may be in from six to seven weeks, press 
in the bung, and leave the wine untouched for twelve months ; 
draw it off then into a clean cask, and fine it, if necessary, with 
isinglass, tied in a muslin and suspended in it. We have not 
ourselves had this receipt tried; but we have tasted wine made 
by it which had been five years kept, and which so much re- 
sembled a rich foreign wine that we could with difficulty believe 
it was English made. 

To eacn gallon of water (boiled and lefl till cold) 8 lbs. of 
fine Malaga raisins; to stand 12 months; then to be drawn off 
and fined. 

Obs. — The refuse raisins make admirable vinegar if fresh 
water be poured to them, and the cask placed in the sun. 
March is the best time for making this wine. 

EXCELLENT ELDEBBERRY WINE. 

Strip the berries, which should be fresh, and gathered on a 
dry day, clean from the stalks, and measure them into a tub or 
large earthen pan. Four boiling water on them, in the pro- 
portion of two gallons to three of berries, press them down into 
the liquor, cover them closely, and let them remain until the 
following day ; then strain the juice from the fruit through a 
sieve or doth, and, when this is done, squeeze from the berries 
the greater part of the remaining juice, mix it with that which 
was first poured off, measure the whole, add to it three pound3

of sugar, three quarters of an canoe of doves, and one ounce of 
gin^r, for every gallon, and boil it twenty minutes, keeping 
it l^orongUy skiimned. Put it, when something more than 
milk-wmnn, into a perfectly dry and sweet cask (or if but a 
very small quantity of wine be nuule, into large stone bottles, 
which answer the purpose quite well), fill this entirely, and set 
the wine directly, with a large spoonful of new yeast dropped 
into the bung-hole, and just stirred round in the liquor, or with 
a small toasted crost thickly spread with yeast.* 

YXBT GOOD OIR6SB WmL 

Boil together, for half an hour, fourteen quarts of water, 
twelve pounds of sugar, a quarter of a pound of the best ginger 
bruised, and the tlun rinds of six large lemons. Put the whole, 
when milk-warm, into a clean dry cask, with the juice of the 
lemons, and half a pound of sun raisins; add one large spoonful 
of thick yeast, and stir the wine every day for ten days. When 
it has ceased to ferment, add an ounce of isinglass, and a pint of 
brandy; bung the wine dose, and in two months it will be fit 
to bottle, but must remain longer in the cask should it be too 
sweet. When it can be obtained, substitute for the water in 
this receipt cider firesh fixnn the press, which will give a very 
sup^or wine.

BZCBIXBNT OBAHOB WIKS. 

Take half a chest of Seville oranges, pare off the rinds as 
thin as possible, put two thirds of them into six gallons of 
water, and let them remain for twenty-four hours. Squeeze 
the oranges (which ought to yield seven or eight quarts of 
juice) through a slleve into a pan, and as they are done throw 
them into six gallons more of water ; let them be washed well in 
it with the hands, and then put into another six gallons of water 
and left till the following day. For each gallon of wine, put 
into the cask three pounds and a quarter of loaf sugar, and the 
liqiior strained dear from the rinds and pulp. Wash these 
again and again, should more liquor be requu^ to fill the cask; 
but do not at any time add raw water. Stir the wine dailv until 
the sugar is perfectly dissolved, and let it ferment from four to

five weeks ; add to it two bottles of brandy, stop it down, and in 
twelve months it will be fit to bottle. 

Ohs, — The excellence of all wine depends so much upon the 
fermentation being properly conducted, that unless the mode of 
regulating this be understood by the maker, there will always 
be great danger of failure in the operation. There is, we be- 
lieve, an excellent work upon the subject by Dr. McCulloch, 
ivhich the reader who needs information upon it will do well to 
c^onsult : our own experience is too slight to enable us to mul- 
tiply our receipts.

U 



TO BOAST COFFEE. 

Persons who drink coffee habitually, and who are particular 
about its flavour and quality, should purchase the b^ kind in 
a raw state, and have it roasted at home. This can be done in 
yeiy small quantities by means of the inexpensiye apparatas 
shown above ; the cost of this not exceeding seven or eight shil- 
lings,* and the supply of charcoal needed for it being veiy 
trifling indeed. The cylinder which contains the coffee should 
be onfy half filled, and it should be turned rather slowly over 
the fire, which should never be fierce, until a strong aromatic 
smell is emitted ; the movement should then be quickened, as 
the grain is in that case quite heated, and it will become too 
highly coloured before it is roasted through, if slowly finished. 
When it is of a fine, light, equal brown, which must be asoer-

tained, until some little experience baa been acquired, bjr sliding 
back the door of the cylinder, and looking at it occasionally 
towards the end of the process, spread it quickly upon a large 
dish, and throw a folded cloth over it. Let it remain thus until 
it ia quite cold ; then put it into canisters or bottles, and exclude 
the air careiully from it. Mr. Webster, in his admirable Ency- 
clopedia of Domestic Economy,* says, " Mr. Donovan recom- 
mends that, instead of roastdng the coffee in an atmosphere of its 
own Bleam, it should first be dried in an iron pan, over a very 
gentle fire, being constantly stirred until the colour becomes 
yellow; it is then to 
be pounded into coarse 
f^'agments, by no means 
too fine, each grain 
being divided into four 
or five parts only : it is 
1 then to be transferred 
' to the roaster, and 
scorched to the proper 
degree." Thisplanwe 
have not tried, because 
ne have found the other 
to answer quite well; 
f tliough Mr. Donovan's 
might nevertheless 
prove a very superior 
one. A roaster of the 
form shown here may 
be pnrchsMd for about fourteen shillings. 



It is mcnre usnal at the present day to filter than to boil cofiee, 
but many persons still [n^fer die latter mode. The d^rce of 
strength wnich is to be given must of course depend on the taste 
of those for whom it is prepared ; but it should always be good 
vfbea served to strangers, as a preference for weak coffee is very 
rare, and in a vast many instances it would be peculiarly dis- 
agreeable to the drinkers, more especially so to those who 
have resided much abroad, where this beverage is in general 
much better prepared than it is in Bneland. 

Aa ounce of the berries, if recently roasted, and ground at 
the instant of using them, will make, with the addition of a

Let it run quite through before the top c^ the percolator is

diminished at will. To make French breaxfast-coffee, pour 
only a third as mudi of water on the powder, fill ihe cups two

BREAD. 




TO P1JSIFT TEA8T FOB BBEAB OB CAKJBS. 

The yeast procured from a public brewery is often so eztremelj 
bitter that it can only be rendered fit for use by frequent 
washings, and after these even it should be cautiously employed. 
Mix it, when first brought in, with a large quantity of cold 
water, and set it by until the foUowins morning in a cool place ; 
then drain off the water, and stir Uie yeast up well with as 
much more of fresh ; it must again stand several hours before 
the water can be poured dear ^m it. By changing this daily 
in Avinter, and both night and morning in very hot weather, 
the veast may be preserved fit for use much longer than it 
would otherwise be ; and should it ferment rather less freely 
after a time, a smaU portion of brown sugar stirred to it before 
the bread is made win quite restore its strength. 

German yeast, imported in a solid state, is now much sold in 
London, and answers, we are told, remarkably well ; but ve 
have not ourselves had an opportunity of proving it. 

THE OVEir. 

A brick oven, heated with wood is &r superior to any other 
for baking bread, as well as for most other punKMes, the best 
of an iron one being much less easy to r^uiate ; but those 
attwslied to the kitchen ranges are convenient, for the fiidlity 



CHAP. XXyiII«3 BREAD. 549 

they afford at all times of baking in a small way. They are, 
however, we should say, far from economical as regardis the 
proportion of j^el required to heat them; and the same objec- 
tion may be made to the American oven also ; the strong smelly 
too, emitted from the iron ones, and dif^ised often entirely 
through a house, is peculiarly unpleasant. A brick oven should 
be wdl heated with &ggot wood, or with a faggot, and two or 
three solid logs; and iSter it is cleared, the door should be 
closely shut for quite half an hour before the baking com- 
mences ; the heat will then be well sustained for a succession of 
bread, pies, cakes, and small pastry. The servant who habitu- 
ally attends at an oven will soon become acquainted with the 
precise quantity of j^el which it requires, and all other 
peculiarities which may be connected with it. In general more 
time must be allowed to bake any thing in an iron than in a 
brick oven. 

TO MAKE BREAD. 

Every coojk, and we might almost say, every female servant^ 
ought to be perfectly acquainted with the mode of making good 
household bread ; and skill in preparing other articles of food 
is poor compensation for ignorance upon this one essential point. 
A very slight degree of attention, moreover, will enable any 
person to succeed in it, and there is, consequently, small excuse 
for diose who neglect to render themselves properly acquainted 
with the process. 

The best flour will generally be found the cheapest in the end; 
it should be purchased if possible from a miller who can be 
depended on for supplying it good and unadulterated. Let it 
be stored always in a diy place, as damp is very injurious to it ; 
if kept habitually in a chest, this should be entirely emptied at 
intervals, cleaned with great nicety, and not filled again until it 
is perfectly dry. The kneading trough tub, or pan, with every 
thing else indeed used for the bread, or for the oven, should at 
all'tmies be kept scrupulously clean. 

The yeast of mild home-brewed beer is the best that can be 
procured, and requires no purifying ; but it should be strained 
through a hair-sieve after it is mixed with a portion of warm 
milk, or water, before it is added to the flour. 

Very rapid fermentation, which is produced by using more 
than the necessaiy quantity of yeast, is by no means advan- 
tageous to the bread, which not only becomes dry and stale 
from it, but is of less sweet and pleasant flavour than that 
which is more slowly fermented. In winter it should always b&

placed near the fire, bat nerer anffidently so to beerane liot; 
nor flhoiild it ever be allowed to become perfectly cold. Fat 
balf a builiel (more or ks^ according to the oonsnniptkm of the 
family) of floor into the kneading tab or trough, and hollow it 
wdl m the middle ; dilute a pint of yeast as it is broag^t from 
the brewery, or half the qnantity if it has been washed and 
rendered solid, with foar qnarts or mote of Inkewarm naXk or 
water, or a mixture of the two; stir into it, from the snrroand- 
inff part, with a wooden spoon, as much fbur as will make a 
thick batto*; throw a litUe over it, and leaye tbis^ which is 
called the leayen, to rise before proceeding farther. In about 
an hour it will have swollen consideramy, and have borst 
through the coating of flour on the top; tbm poor in as much 
more wann liquid as will convert the whole, with fftfod 
kneadingy and tius should not be spared, into a firm dough, of 
which ike surface should be entirely free from lumps or 
crumbs. Throw a cloth over, and let it remain until it has 
risen very much a second time, which will be in an hour, or 
something more, if the batch be huge. Then work it lightly 
np^ and mould it into loaves of firmn two to three pounds 
weight; send them directly to a wdl heated oven, and bake 
them firom an hour and a half to an hour and three quarters. 

Flour, I bushel ; salt (when it is liked\ 4 to 6 ozs. ; yeast, 
1 pint unwashed, or | pint if purified ; mils, or water, 2 quarts: 
1 to 1} hour. Additional liquid as needed. 

BORDTKE BREAD. 

(Auikor*9 Receipt^ 

Mix with a gallon of floor a large teaspoonful of fine saltf 
make a hollow in the centre, and pour in two tablespoonlul 
of solid, well-purified yeast, gradually dilated with about tvo 
pints and a hidf of milk, and work it into a thick batter with 
the surrounding flour ; dust a little on the top, and leave it to 
rise from an hour to an hour and a half; tnen knead it up 
with as much more warm skimmed milk as will render it 
qaite firm and smooth without being very stiflT; let it rise 
another hour, and divide it into three loaves ; pot them into 
square tins slightly buttered, or into round bakmg pans, and 
bake them about an hour and a ouarter in a well-heated oven. 
The dough can be formed into household loaves if preferred, 
and sent to the oven in the usual way. When a finer and 
more spongy kind of bread is required for immediate eating, 
substitute new milk for skimmed, dissolve in it about an 
ounce of butter, leave It more liquid when the sponge ia set. 



CHAP. XXYHI.^ BREAD. 551 

and let the whole be lightly kneaded into a lithe dough ; the 
bread thas made will be excellent when new, and for a day 
or so after it is baked, but it will become dry sooner than the 
other. 

Flour, 1 gallon ; salt, I teaspoonful ; skimmed milk, 2| 
pints : to rise from I to 1} hour. Additional milk, 1 to 2 pints : 
to rise 1 hour. 3 loaves, baked 1| hour. 

Obs. 1. — A few spoonsful of cream Mrill wonderfully im* 
proYe either of the atxyre receipts, and sweet butter-milk sub- 
stituted for the other will gire to the bread the shortness of 
a cake: we would particula^y recommend it for trial when 
it can be procured. 

Obs» 2. — For an invalid, especially when the digestion is 
impaired, butter should be altogether omitted from the bread ; 
ana eggs, which are often added to the finer sorts of rolls, are 
better avoided also. 

Obs. 3. — We must repeat our caution against milk or water 
of a scalding heat being mixed ever with the yeast : it should 
be warm, rather more so than when taken from the cow, but 
not much. 

BROWN BREAD. 

Make this by either of the foregoing receipts, with meal, 
as it is called (that is to say, the wheat just as it is ground, 
either separated from the coarse bran or not, according to the 
quality of the bread required)^ instead of flour. It ferments 
easily, and does not therefore require a very full proportion 
of yeast ; and it absorbs more moisture than the flour ; it also 
retains it longer, if properly baked. The loaves should be 
avell soaked in the oven, but not over dried. 

Obs, — The best Inread we ever tasted was made in great 
part with rye-flour : this was in a provincial town in France. 

POTATO BREAD. 

One pound of good mealy potatoes, steamed or boiled very 
dry, in the ordinary way, or prepared by Captain Eater's 
receipt (see Chapter XV.), and rubbed quite hot, through a 
coarse sieve, into a couple of pounds ot flour, with which 
thejr should be well mixed, will produce excellent bread, 
which will remain moist much longer than wheaten bread 
made as usual. The yeast should be added immediatelv after 
the potatoes. An ounce or two of butter, an eg^, and some 
new milk, will convert this bread into very superior rolls. 



552 MODEBN COOKERY. [COAP. XXYm. 

OENETA ROLLS. 

Break down very small three ounces of batter into a couple 
of pounds of flour; add a little salt, and set the sponge with 
a large tablespoonful of solid yeast, mixed with a pint of new 
milk, and a tablespoonful or more of strong saffron water ; let 
it rise for a full nour, then stir to a couple of well-beaten 
eggs as much hot milk as will render them lukewarm, and 
wet the roUs with them to a light, lithe dough ; leave it from 
half to three quarters of an hour longer, mould it into small 
rolls, brush them with beaten yolk of egg, and bake them 
fiDom twenty minutes to half an hour. The addition of six 
ounces of good sugar, three of batter, half a pound or more of 
currants, the grated rind of a large lemon, and a couple of 
ounces of candied orange-rind, will conyert these into excel- 
lent buns. When the &vour of the saffron is hot liked, omit 
it ^together. Only so much should be used at any time as 
will give a rich colour to the bread. 

Flour, 2 lbs. i butter, 3 ozs. ; solid yeast, 1 large table- 
spoonful (saffron, 1 teaspoonfiil ; water, less than a quarter 
pint) I new milk, 1 pint: 1 hour, or more. 2 eggs, more 
milk : f hour : b^ed 20 to 30 minutes. 

¥ 

RUSKS.' • ■ •' 

Break very small six ounces of butter into a couple of 
pounds of fine dry flour, and mix them iiito a lithe paste, with 
two tablespoonsful of mild beer-yeast, three well-beaten eggs, 
and nearly half a pint of warm new milk. When it has risen 
to its full height knead it smooth, and make it into very small 
loaves or thick cakes, cut with a round cake-cutter ; place 
them on a floured tin, and let them stand in a warm place, to 
provCf from ten to twenty minutes before they are set into 
the oven. Bake them about a quarter of an hour; divide 
them while they are still warm, and put them into a very slow 
oven to dry. When they are crisp quite through they are done. 
Four teaspoonsful of sifted sugar must be added when sweet- 
ened rusks are preferred. 

Flour, 2 lbs. ; butter, 6 ozs. ; yeast, 2 tablespoonsful ; eggs, 
3 ; new milk, nearly half a pint : baked \ hour. 

CRUSTS TO SERVE WITH CHEESE. 

Take a half-baked loaf from the oven, and tear it into small 
rough bits with a couple of forks; lay these on a tin, and put 
them back into the oven for ten minutes. If a light loaf be 



APPENDIX. 553 

made for the parpose, with a couple of ounces of butter and 
new mUk, they will quite resemble rusks. 

GOCOA-NUT BREAD. 

Either mix with the flour the same proportion of the nut, 
finely grated, as for the biscuit receipt, and then proceed as 
for other bread, or merely use very strongly flavoured cocoa- 
nut milk to make the dough : the bread will be excellent.

CHEBBT-BRANDT. 

{TappingUm Evei'ard Receipt^ 

Fill to about two thirds of their dej^th, some wide-necked 
bottles with the small cherries caUed m the markets brandy- 
blacks ; pour in sufficient sifted sugar to fill up more than half 
of the remaining space, and then as much good French brandy as 
will coyer the firuit, and reach to the necl^ of the bottles. Cork 
them securely, and let them stand for two months before they 
are opened : the liqueur poured fix)m the cherries will be excel- 
lent, and the &uit itself very good. 

BBANDIED ,MOBELLA CHEBBIES. 

Let the cherries be ripe, freshly gathered, and the finest that 
can be had ; cut off halt the length of the stalks, and drop them 
gently into clean diy quart bottles with wide necks ; leave in 
each sufficient space lor four ounces of pounded white sugar 
candy (or of brown, if better liked) : fill them up entirely with 
the best French brandy, and cork them closely : the fruit will 
not shrivel if thus prepared. A few cherry, or apricot kernels, 
or a small portion of cinnainon, can be added when they are 
considered an improvement. .

FXACKn IN BBAHDT. 

(fiotierdam Receipt^ 

Prepare and stew some fine full-flayoured peaches by the 
receipt of page 430, but with two ounces more of sugar to the 
half pint of water ; when thejr are tender put them with their 
vprop into elass or new stCHie jars, whfeh they should only half 
nil ; and men the^ are qpute cold pour in white or very pale 
Fr^ich brandy to within an inch and a half of the brims : a few 
peach or apricot kernels can be added to them. The jars must 
be corked down. 

STBAWBEBBT TABTIiETS. (OOOB.) 

Take a full half-pint of fresfalp-gathered strawberries, wiUi- 
out the stalks : first crash, and then mix them with two ounces 
and a half of powdered sugar; stir to them, by d^rees, four 
well-whisked ^gs, beat the mixture a little, and put it into 
pattypans lined with fine paste : they should be only three 
parts filled. Bake the tarUets fiom ten to twelve minutes. 

BASPBEBBT PUTFS. 

Roll out thin some fi/ie puff-pfste, cut it in rounds or squares 
of equal size, lay some raspberry jam into each, moisten the 
edges of the paste, fold and press mem together, and bake the

jam will serve for them equaUy wdL 

CS£AMEI> TABXUETS. 

Line some patt^ans with very fine paste, and pat into each 
a laver of apricot jam ; on this pour some tlnck-boikd costard, 
or the pastry cream of page 361. Whisk the whites of aeoiqple 
of eggs to a solid froth, mix a couple of tablespoon^l of si&d 
su^ with them, lay this icing lightly over the tartlets, and 
baike them in a gex^ oven &om twenty to thirty minutes, 
unless they should be very small when less time must be allo¥red

Kub half a pound of good butter into a pound of fine dry 
fiour, and work it very small ; mix well with these half a pound 
of 8ifi;ed sugar, and pour to them first a quarter of a pint of 
boiling milk, and next three well-whisked eggs ; add some grated 
nutmeg, or firesh lemon-rind, and eight ounces of currants ; beat 
the whole well and lightly together, and the instant before the 
cake is moulded and set mto the oven, stir to it a teaspoonful 
of carbonate of soda in the finest powder. Bake it from an hour 
to an hour and a quarter, or divide it in two, and allow from 
half to three quarters of an hour for each cake.

Obs. — This, if well made, resembles a pound cake, but is much 
more wholesome. It is very good with two ounces less of butter, 
^md with carraway-seeds or candied orange or citron substituted 
for the currants. 



GALF*S LIVES STOVED, OB STEWED. 

From three to four pounds of the best part of the liver will 
be sufficient for a dish of moderate size. First lard it quite 
through by the directions of page 166, with large lardoons, 
rolled in a seasoning of mace, and of savoury herbs very finely 
minced ; then lay it into a stewpan or saucepan just fitted to its 
size, and pour in about half a pint of broth or ^avy ; heat it 
very gently, and throw in, mien it begins to sunmer, a sliced 
carrot, a small onion cut in two, a small bunch of parsley, and 
a blade of mace ; stew the liver as softly as possible over a very 
slow fire from two hours and a half to three hours ; thicken the 
gravy with a little brown roux (see page 96), or with a dessert- 
spoonful of browned flour; add a couple of glasses of white 
•wine, and a little spice if needed, and serve it very hot, after 
having taken out the herbs and vegetables. 

The liver may be stewed without being larded; it may like-

vise be farowned all over in a caiefnlly made roax, before the 
gra^y is poured to it : this must then be made to boil, and be 
added in small portions, the stewpan being well shaken romid 
as each is thrown in. The wine can be altogether omitted ; or 
a wineglassfiil of port, mixed with a little lemon-jnice, may take 
the pli^ of sheny. After the liver has been wiped Y&ry diy, 
minced herbs may be strewed thickly over it before it is laid 
into tiie stewpan : it may be served in its own gravy, or with 
a sauce piqnante.

FXACKn IN BBAHDT. 

(fiotierdam Receipt^ 

Prepare and stew some fine faU-fiayoured peaches by the 
receipt of page 430, but with two ounces more of sugar to the 
half pint of water ; when thejr are tender put them with their 
flTTop into dasB or new stone jars, which tney should only half 
nil ; and 'men the^ are qpiite cold poor in white or yeiy psle 
Froich branfy to within an inch and a half of the brims : a few 
:h or apricot kernels can be added to them. The jars most 



pCBC 

bea 



corked down. 

STBAWBEBST TABTUBTS. (gOOB.) 

Take a full half-pint of fresUr-gathered strawberries, with- 
out the stalks : first crash, and then mix them with two ounoes 
and a half of powdered sugar; stir to them, by d^rees, four 
well-whisked eggs, beat the mixture a little, and put it into 
pattypans lin^ with fine paste : they should be only three 
parts filled. Bake the tartlets firom ten to twelve minutes. 

SASPBEBBT PUFFS. 

Roll out thin some fi/ie puff-pfste, cut it in rounds or squares 
of equal size, lay some raspb^ry jam into each, moisten the 
edges of the paste, fold and press mem together, and bake the 
fom from ten to fifteen minutes. Stxawbony,. or any other 
jam will serve for them equally wdL 

CREAMED TABTIETS. 

Line some patt^^Mins with very fine paste, and put into each 
a laver of apricot jam ; on this pour some tluck-lmled costard, 
or the pastry cream of pa^e 361. Whisk the whites of a couple 
o^ eggs to a solid froth, mix a couple of tablespoonafiil of sifted 
supr with them, lay this icing lightly over the tartlets, and 
bale them in a gentle oven from twenty to thirty minutes, 
unless they should be very small when less time must be allowed 
for them. 

NOBFOLK CHEESE CAKES. 

Beat well together until they are perfectly smooth, three 
quarters a( a pound of cheese curd and ^e ounces of butter: 
add to them two ounces of almonds, of which ^e or sax diooM 
be bitter ones, four ounces of sifted si^ar, firar eggs, leaving 
but two of the whites, three qwonaful of cream, two of brandy, 
a little mace or nutmeg, and if candied peel and currants are 



AFFENDIX. 555 

approyed, one ounce and a hslf of the first, and three of the 
latter. Finish and hake the cheese cakes as the preceding ones. 
Curd, f IK; batter, 5 obbl ; sugar, 4 oia. ; ahncMids, 2 oos. ; 
eggs, 4 yolks, 2 whites ; cream, 3 tedblespoonsful ; brandy, 2 ; 
little mace or nutmeg; currants (if added), 3 oos.; candied 
orange or kmon-rind, 1} oz. : 20 minutes. 

▲ GOOD 803>A CAKX. 

Rub half a pound of good butter into a pound of fine dry 
flour, and work it very small ; mix well with these half a pound 
of sifi;ed sugar, and pour to them first a quarter of a pint of 
boiling milk, and next three well-whisked eggs ; add some grated 
nutmeg, or firesh lemon-rind, and eight oimces of currants ; beat 
the whole well and lightly together, and the instant before the 
cake is moulded and set mto the oven, stir to it a teaspoonful 
of carbonate of soda in the finest powder. Bake it from an hour 
to an hour and a quarter, or divide it in two, and allow from 
half to three quarters of an hour for each cake. 

Flour, 1 lb. ; butter, 3 ozs. ; sugar, 8 ozs. ; milk, full quarter- 
pint ; eggs, 3 ; currants, ^ lb. ; carbonate of soda, 1 teaspoonful; 
1 to li hour. Or, divided, ^ to f hour, moderate oven. 

Obs. — ^This, if well made, reSembles a pound cake, but is much 
more wholesome. It is very good with two ounces less of butter, 
and with carraway-seeds or candied orange or citron substituted 
for the currants. 



GALF*S LIVES STOVED, OB STEWED. 

From three to four pounds of the best part of the liver will 
be sufficient for a dish of moderate size. First lard it quite 
through by the directions of page 166, with large lardoons, 
rolled in a seasoning of mace, and of savoury herbs very finely 
minced ; then lay it into a stewpan or saucepan just fitted to its 
size, and pour in about half a pint of broth or gravy ; heat it 
very gently, and throw in, mien it begins to sunmer, a sliced 
carrot, a small onion cut in two, a small bimch of parsley, and 
a blade of mace ; stew the liver as softly as possible over a very 
sbw fire from two hours and a half to three hours ; thicken the 
gravy with a little brown roux (see page 96), or with a dessert- 
spoonful of browned flour; add a couple of glasses of white 
wine, and a little spice if needed, and serve it very hot, after 
having taken out the herbs and vegetables. 

The liver may be stewed without being larded; it may like-
