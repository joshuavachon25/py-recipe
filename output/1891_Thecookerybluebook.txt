The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit ; 

The clock hath struck twelve upon the bell; 

My mistress made it one upon my cheek — 

She is so hot, because the meat is cold; 

Methinks your man, like mine, should be your clock, 

A7id strike you home ivithout a messenger. 

My charge was but to fetch you from the mart 

Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner — 

My mistress and her sister wait for you.

SOUPS. 



Bouillon Soup. 

4 pounds of round of beef cut into dice pieces. Trim 
off all fatty skin. 4 quarts water ; 1 teaspoonful celery 
seed ; 4 large onions ; 6 large carrots ; bunch of pars- 
ley ; 6 blades of mace ; 16 whole cloves, salt and pepper 
to taste. 

Pour on the water, and let it simmer six hours, 
skimming carefully, for if any grease is allowed to go 
back into the soup it is impossible to make it clear. 
Scrape the carrots, stick 4 whole cloves into each 
onion, and put them in the soup ; then add the cel- 
ery seed, parsley, mace, pepper and salt. Let this 
boil till the vegetables are tender, then strain through 
a cloth, pouring the soup through first, then putting 
the meat in it to drain, never squeezing or pressingit. 

If you wish to color it, you can put in a dessert- 
spoon of burnt sugar. It can be nicely flavored by 
adding some walnut catsup, together with mushroom 
and a very little Worcestershire.

quart boiling water. Pour hot water over the sugar 
and lemon juice, and stir until it is dissolved. When
