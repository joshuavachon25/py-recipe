PREFACE 



¥ N this book I have endeavored, to the best of my ability, to tell how to 
make breads, calces, pastries, ices, creams, and candies for the baker, 
pastry cook, and confedlioner ambitious to do good work. My own success 
in this business is due to a careful study of the materials and to painstaking 
work covering a period of twenty-five years in places where good work was 
demanded. 

My obje<a in writing this book is to improve the standard of pastry work, 
and to raise the pastry cook to a higher plane by enabling him to command 
higher wages than have heretofore been customarily paid; also to elevate the 
bread and pastry cookii^ to the plane of high-class meat cooking. 

The making of the book has been a labor of love, and my earnest desire 
now is that the work shall bear fruit by popularizing, not alone the consump- 
tion of pastry, but also the profession of pastry making. 

Paul Hicbaiuis.

ilies with good results. It is more like the pro- 
cess used in large canning establisbments and is 
done in two ways — either the fruit is boiled in 
syrup for twelve to twenty-five minutes, and then 
put in heated glasses and closed up air-tight; or 
the fruit is put in glasses (peaches, pears and 
quinces already blanched; berries are put in in 
their natural state), the glasses filled with syrup, 
the covers put on, then set in a bain marie or a 
large pan of cold water with some straw under and 
between to prevent breaking. Put on the fire and 
let gradually come to a boil; and from the time it 
comes to the boil — from twelve to twenty-five 
minutes, according to the ripeness or kind of fruit 
(berries from ten to twelve minutes, also ripe 
peaches and apricots; pears and quinces twenty 
to twenty-five minutes). The water should come 
up to the neck of the glasses and a lid or board 
put on to prevent them turning over. Then they 
are taken out and the covers closed tight. Let 
them cool slowly and tighten the covers again as 
they get cold. Fruits put up this way will keep 
for years, provided the proper care has been tak- 
en, first in selecting and preparing the fruit, and, 
secondly, if they are kept in the proper place. I 
would advise to look after the preserves once a 
week for the first month; after this once a month, 
and in case any of it should show signs of fer- 
mentation, to either use them or boil them over. 
Very little sugar is needed for this way of pre- 
serving; it varies from six to sixteen ounces for 
the quart of fruit: it depends if they are used for 
pies or for table fruits. 

* # 

JAMS, JELLIES, COMPOTES AND SYRUPS. 

Marmalades or Jams are the pulp of fruits, 
boiled with sugar to a certain consistency. The 
fruit is crushed, and for each pint of pulp is added 
from twelve to sixteen ounces of sugar, then 
boiled together till clear. When it coats the 
spoon and falls in clots from the spatula it is 
ready. 

The proper point may also be ascertained by 
dropping some on a cold plate; if it sets soon it is 
ready. 

Jam must be constantly stirred while it is cook- 
ing, to prevent sticking to the vessel and burning. 
When done, put up in jars, with a piece of 
brandied paper over and the «id put on; or paper 
securely tied over to form a cover. 

I.— APPLE MARMALADE OR JAM. 
Pare and core some good juicy apples; put in 
preserving pan with enough water to cover the 
fruit, let boil slow till they are reduced tc a mash, 
then pass through a colander. To each pound of 
pulp add twelve ounces of sugar; put back on the 



fire and boil till it falls in clots from the spatula, 

then put up as directed above. 

2.— STRAWBERRY AND RASPBERRY JAMS 

Rub the berries through a sieve. Take one 
pound of sugar for the strawberries, and twelve 
ounces for the raspberries, for each pint of pulp. 
Boil till they begin to jelly and adhere to the skim- 
mer. Be careful to take ofi all the scum that 
rises. Fill in to glasses, and when cool put over 
it brandied paper and covers. 

3,— CURRANT JAM. 

Mash four quarts of currants and two quarts of 
raspberries; add to each pint of pulp one pound 
sugar. Stir till it jellies, and put up like Rasp- 
berry Jam (No. 2). 

4.— GOOSEBERRY PRESERVE— BAR LE 
DUG JELLY. 

Take the berries before they are ripe, either red 
or green. Remove tops and stems. Cut the berries 
and remove the seeds. Take for each pound of 
berries one pound of sugar. Boil slow till the 
fruit is perfectly clear and begins to jelly (about 
thirty minutes). Fill into glass tumblers. When 
cold cover with brandied paper and put on the 
cover. 

To white berries a little red currant juice may 
be added for color. The fruit should not be 
stirred very much during cooking. 

5.— GOOSEBERRY JAM. 

Take ripe berries, wash and remove tops and 
stems. For each pound of berries take twelve 
ounces of sugar. Crush the berries and mix with 
the sugar. Let boil and keep stirring constantly 
till it falls in clots from the spatula. Put up like 
the other jams (see No. 2). 

6.— BLACKBERRY JAM. 

Pick over and clean the berries. Add for each 
pound of fruit eight to twelve ounces of sugar. 
Mix all together, but add no water. Heat slow 
until it boils, and keep on stirring until it thick- 
ens, which takes from thirty to forty five min- 
utes. Put up like other jams (see No. 2). 
7— GRAPE JAM. 

Break the grapes, savinp the skins. Heat the 
pulp for " couple of minutes, but do not let it 
boil; strain through sieve to remove the seads; 
add the skins and take twelve ounces of sugar to 
each pound of pulp. Boil till it thickens and 
jellies, then put up in jars. 

8.— QUINCE JAM. 
Pare, core and slice the fruit. Take the peel, 
core and seeds, cover with water and boil till 
soft, then strain through a cloth. Put the sliced 
fruit in the liquid and boil together till soft. Rub 
through a colander. Then to each pint of pulp 
add twelve ounces of sugar. Boil till it thickens.

served without the use of sugar, by boiling the 
fruit in the bottles for about thirty minutes and 
seal as usual. 

26.— CRUSHED RASPBERRIES AND 
STRAWBERRIES PRESERVED COLD. 

Raspberries and strawberries may also be pre- 
served cold, for creams and ices; but have to be 
kept in a cold dry storage of even temperature. 

Take ripe berries, crush and rub through a fine 
sieve. With each pint of pulp mix two pounds of 
sugar; mix well together and fill into bottles. 
Cork, tie down and keep in cool place. 

27.— PRESERVING OF PIE FRUITS. 

Pie fruits require less sugar than is generally 
used in the richer preserves. For a medium 
sweet preserve use the sugar as given in the table 
below. For each quart of fruit use: 

Strawberries, 8 ounces of sugar. 

Raspberries, 6 " " " 

Blackberries, 6 " " " 

Blueberries, 6 " " " 

Gooseberries, 8 ' 

Cranberries, 10 

Cherries, 8 " " " 

Grapes, 8 " " " 

Apples, 6 " " " 

Peaches, 6 " " " 

Quinces, 10 " " " 

Pears, 8 " " " 

Plums, 8 " " " 

Rhubarb, 12 

Prepare the fruit after the method as given in 
the general instructions at the beginning of these 
receipts, by either boiling in the syrup and filling 
into the glasses; or put the fruit in the glasses 
and fill up with hot syrup. Set the jar in warm 
water with the cover on and boil till the fruit gets 
tender. Have the jars filled to the brim, remove 
from the water, put on the rubber, tighten the 
cover, then let cool and put away. 

Where fruit is used in large quantities, it may 
be put up in large jars which hold from one to 
ten gallons. Take jars with narrow necks, heat 
and scald well, and fill in the fruit right from the 
preserving kettle. Fill up to the neck. Put in 
over the fruit a brandied paper, then pour over a 
layer of melted paraflBne and cover up. The jars 
should not be moved about very much as there is 
danger of loosening the paraffine cover by so doing. 
28.— COMPOTE OF FRUITS. 

The fruits are preserved in a light syrup and are 
put in bowls or jars for immediate use. Either 
fresh or dried fruit may be used for compotes. 
The dried fruits should be washed and soaked for 
several hours before stewing; and some fruit re- 
quire soaking over night. 

APPLES, PEARS, PEACHES and APRI- 



COTS are peeled and stewed or baked whole, 
cut in halves or slices and stewed till tender. 

CHERRIES are pitted or stewed whole. BER- 
ries are picked over, washed and stewed whole. 
PLUMS and CHERRIES are often stewed with 
the stalks on them. The plums should be pricked 
all over with a pin to prevent the breaking of the 
skin. 

To preserve the whiteness of the fruits: AP- 
PLES, QUINCES and PEARS, the peeled fruit, 
should be put in cold water before preserving. 
The skin of ripe PEACHES and APRICOTS is 
easily removed by dipping in boiling water for a 
moment. The green fruits should be peeled. 
For compotes the fruit should be stewed tender, 
so as to keep whole and in shape. 

29.— COMPOTE OF WHOLE APPLES. 

Peel and core the apples. Put in flat sauce 
pan, with a stick of cinnamon, the peel and juice 
of one lemon. Cover with a thin syrup, made with 
two pounds of sugar to two quarts of water. Let 
stew slowly till tender. Take the apples out ol 
the syrup and place in a shallow dish. Boil the

dish, after removing the peel and cinnamon. Set 
to cool and serve. The apples may be served 
plain or with whipped cream. 

30.— BAKED COMPOTE OF APPLES. 

Peel and core the apples, put close together in 
a pan and pour over a syrup made as in the re- 
ceipt No. 29. Put in the oven and bake till done.

lemon, also one stick cinnamon; stew slowly till 
tender; serve. 

32.— APPLE BRAISE. 

Prepare like for Sliced Compote No. 31. Use 
one pound of sugar to the quart of water; add 
half a pint of white wine, also add four ounces of 
currants, four ounces Sultana raisins and tour 
ounces almonds, blanched and sliced, two ounces 
of butter, one stick cinnamon and one lemon peel.

some water till soft; sweeten and press throngh 
colander; serve hot or cold. 

35.— COMPOTE OF PEARS. 

Select nice pears; peel and divide in halves or 
quarters; remove the seeds and stew slowly in a 
light syrup with the juice of one lemon and a few 
whole cloves till tender. Take out of the syrup 
and put into a shallow dish. Reduce the syrup 
and pour over the fruit; let cool and serve. 
36.— COMPOTE OF QUINCES.

water. Boil the peel and core in some water till 
soft, then strain off the juice. Add one pound of 
sugar to each quart of the liquid. Let come to 
a boil, then add the sliced fruit and stew till 
tender. 

Sweet apples and quinces in equal portions 
make a nice compote stewed in this manner. 
37.— COMPOTE OF CHERRIES. 

Take sour cherries, remove the stems and 
stones and stew in a light syrup till clear. Serve 
cold. 

38— COMPOTE OF WHITE CHERRIES.

water. Take from the water and put into fresh 
water; add a few slices of lemon, a stick of cinna- 
mon and enough sugar to make a thin syrup; let 
boil very slow till the fruit has resumed the nat- 
ural shape, then take off the fire and let cool. 
Prunes should be handled carefully in serving, so 
as not to break the fruit. 

All other dried fruits should be prepared in the 
same manner. Peaches and pears sometimes re- 
quire twenty-four hours soaking. 

44.— COMPOTE OF CRANBERRIES. 

Wash and pick over. To each quart of berries 



add one pound of sugar and half pint of water to 
make a plain syrup; stew the berries slowly in the 
syrup till clear. To keep the berries whole do

67.-SUGAR BOILING DEGREES. 

Sugar is boiled from 

Pearl to thread for syrup; 

Blow and feather for crystalization and con- 
serves; 

Ball, crack and caramel for candy and spun 
sugar work. 

It is divided into about sixteen different degrees, 
but without a certain standard for all, which is 
caused from the use of more or less glucose in the 
different recipes. The degrees can be ascertained 
by the use of the thermometer and also by the 
finger test. I give here eight of the degrees most 
generally used for syrups and candy making: 

DEGREES OF THERMOMETER. 

Pearl and small thread, 218 to 220 degrees. 

Large thread 

Blow - . - 

Softball - 

Hard ball - 

Small crack 

Hard crack - 

Caramel - 

The finger test: Put five pounds of sugar 
to boil with one quart of water on a good fire in a 
copper basin, and let come to a boil. Take off 
with a skimmer the scum which rises. Then, 
with a wet sponge, wash down the sides to pre-

Be careful that the fire does not 
brown the sugar on the sides of the pan and dis- 
color the sugar. 

Small thread: When the syrup has boiled 
for some time, dip the top of the finger in the 
syrup, and test between the thumb and forefinger. 
If it can be drawn into a fine thread which breaks 
if drawn out, it has reached the proper degree. 

Large thread: Continue boiling and try 
again as before, until the thread can be pulled 
to the full spread of the fingers before it breaks. 

Blow degree: Dip the skimmer in the sugar 
and blow through the holes. If bubbles appear, 
it has reached the degree. 

Soft ball: To test the ball degree, take a 
pan with ice water. First dip the finger in the 
water, then in the sugar, and as quick as possible 
back in the water. (A stick may be used in place 
of the finger for this purpose). Try the sugar, 
and if it can be formed into a soft small ball it 
has reached the degree. 

Hard ball: A little more boiling, and by the 
same test it will form a larger and harder ball. 

Small crack: The boiling is continued. Test 
again and press the sugar flat between the fing- 
ers; if it breaks, or bites hard and does not stick to 
the teeth, it has attained the proper degree. 

Hard crack: If the sugar breaks short and 
crisp with a snap, it has reached the degree. 

Caramel: In a few moments more the sugar 
will turn to a golden color, and this is the cara* 
mel degree. Take off the fire and turn out on 
the marble at once. 

A little mere boiling and the sugar begins to 
smoke, turn dark brown, then black and burn. 

At this stage it is used for coloring. Water is 
added and it is boiled into a syrup and put in 

bottles for use.

COLORS. 
68.— COCHINEAL. 
Take one ounce of cochineal; 
Half ounce of alum; 
Half ounce of salts of tartar; 
Two ounces of cream of tartar. 
Powder all well together and add three pints of 
water. Let come to a boil in a granite or copper 
vessel. Add eight ounces sugar and stir till cool. 
Mix with half a gill of alcohol, strain and pat io 
bottles; cork and put away for use. 
69.— CARMINE. 
Powder one ounce of carmine; dilute with half a 
gill of water and half a gill alccbo! and put in 
bottles. 

70.— YELLOW. 
One ounce of powdered Turmeric and half a 
pint of water and alcohol. Put in bottle, let

stand in a warm place for three days or more and 
filter for use. 

71.— SAFFRON YELLOW. 
Safiron has a pronounced flavor of its own, and 
is not suitable for all purposes. Boil one ounce 
of Spanish saffron slowly in one pint of water, till 
it is reduced to half a pint. Mix with half a gill 
alcohol, strain and bottle. 

72.— GREEN. 
Green color can be made from the juice of spin- 
ach, by chopping and pressing the juice in a towel, 
and mixing with some syrup and a pinch of alum. 
But it is better and more practical to buy it from 
responsible dealers. 



73.— COLORED SUGAR. 

Colored sugar in the best form. Nonpareil 
Sugar, can be made only by the practical candy 
maker with machinery. But plain colored sugar 
may be made from coarse granulated sugar. 

Sift the sugar to remove the fine grains, put in a 
shallow pan and add some desired color, mix well 
together, set in a warm place and stir till the sugar 
is dry. Put in bottles for use. 

Dessicated cocoanut, which is cut rather fne, 
can be shaded into the various colors, and dried 
like the sugar. 

Almonds may be blanched, cut, or chopped fine, 
and colored green and flavored with pistachio ex' 
tract, to represent pistachio nuts.

The flour should be a good winter wheat or and prick the paste^all oyer with a fork,^to prevent

The bread flours made from bard spring wheat 
are not suitable for pastry. 

The butter should be firm and tough. 

Butter which contains cheese and is curdly 
makes only poor puff paste. 

For pie paste the lard should be fresh and 
firm, and the pastes should be mixed with cold 
water, and worked up in a cold place till they are 
ready to be baked. 

To prevent the shrinking of puS paste, it should 
rest after it is made ready for the oven, and be 
kept in a cold place from fifteen to thirty minutes. 

The baking of pastry requires a brisk heat, 
Pufi Paste from 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, 
and Pie Paste from 350 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Puff paste should not be baked with other 
goods which make steam, because this prevents 
rising; and when the goods (patties or pies) are 
baked up, the heat may be decreased by opening 
the damper to prevent taking too much color. 

To bake patties and other pu& paste goods, the 
pans should be wetted with water and not greased. 

For pie paste the tins and tart forms require 
greasing. 

The pie fillings should be cold when used. A 
warm filling would cause the shrinking of the top 
crust and spoil the paste. 



blistering; dust with a little flour and place an 
empty pie tin with a clean bottom on top of the 
paste (the bottom of the tin may be greased 
lightly to prevent adhering to the paste). Put 
the bottoms in the oven and bake. When the 
paste which shows between the two tins begins to 
color, the top tin may be removed and the baking 
finished in one tin. 

The cream and lemon fillings for open pies 
should be filled in the baked bottoms while hot. 
The custard pies require a slower heat in baking 
than the fruit pies; and for deep pies of this kind, 
it is preferable to warm the milk or custard in- 
stead of filling it ice cold into the pies. 

The filling of the pies is done in the oven. The 
bottoms are placed in the oven and the filling is 
done best with a dipper made for this purpose, to 
which a long wooden handle can be attached. If 
the custard is filled into the pies cold it begins to 
bake from the rim to the center; the outer part 
puffs up before the center is baked, and when 
taken from the oven the puffed up part of the 
custard falls down, because it is baked too much. 
The heating of the custard before filling in the 
pies prevents this, and causes the pie to bake 
more evenly. 

PIE AND TART FILLINGS. 
In the hotels a better and richer pie should be 



In pie making two kinds of paste are generally made than in the ordinary bakeries and cheap res-

is made richer than the paste used for the bottom, 
because the rich crust would become soggy if used 
for the bottom. The trimmings left over are used

as given later on in the recipes. 

The habit of using pie trimmings for custard 
pies, working in more flour, makes a tough taste- 
less crust unfit to eat. The trimmings can be 
used to better advantage for fruit pies. 

The bottoms for cream and lemon pies can be 
made from any of the top or bottom paste, and 
also from custard pie paste. 



which are best if they are put up in the hotel. 
If canned fruits are used which are put up in 
factories, it is preferable to buy a good grade of 
fruit, because the cheap grades which are labeled 
pie fruits consist often of the inferior, unripe 
fruit without any flavor. 

Some of the canned fruits require additional 
cooking down with more sugar to make them 
usable.

PAUL Richards' book of breads, cakes, pastries, ices and sweetmeats. 



Use good pastry flour (not a bread flour). 
Have all the ingredients cold, the butter and lard 
firm, and mix with iced water. 

Do not work the crust in mixing: shake it to- 
gether only, and sprinkle the water between so 
the shortening and flour will hold together. 

Dust the table, put on the mixed paste and roll 
it into a sheet; fold into a square and put away for 
use. 

All lard may be used for economical reasons; 
but the use of some butter with the lard gives the 
best flavored crust. 

79.— PIE PASTE, TOP CRUST. 

Two pounds of flour, one pounil of lard, half 
pound of butter. 

Have the shortening good and hard and the 
flour cold. 

Chop the shortening in the flour and mix with 
iced water to a medium firm dough as directed 
above, and set on ice to cool. 

For use, cut in pieces large enough for a pie 
covering when rolled out. 

If all lard is used, add a pinch of salt. 

[For a cheaper grade of pie top crust, ten ounces 
of lard may be used for each pound of flour.] 
80.— PIE PASTE, BOTTOM CRUST. 

Two pounds of flour, one pound of lard, a little 
salt. 

Rub the lard in the flour and mix lightly with 
cold water into a medium firm paste, working 
paly enough so it holds together, and put away 
f<3t use. 

81.— CUSTARD PIE PASTE. 

Three pounds of flour, eight ounces of butter, 
-tight ounces of lard, one ounce of sugar, two yolks. 

Rub the butter in the flour, add the yolks and 
tugar and mix with milk or water into smooth paste. 
82.— SHORT PASTE FOR TARTS. 

Three pounds of flour, one pound of butter, six 
ounces of sugar, six yolks. 

Mix with milk, like the custard paste (No. 81). 
83— BOTTOM PASTE FOR LARGE CAKES 

AND LAYERS. 
DTwo pounds of flour, one pound of butter, eight 
ounces of sugar, two eggs, half pint of water, a 
little powdered ammonia, the grated rind of one 
lemon. 

Rub the flour with the butter as for pie dough. 
Dissolve the ammonia in the water, and mix eggs, 
water and sugar together. Beat it up well and 
mix with the flour and batter, (do not work the 
mixture much). Set in the ice box till wanted. 
84.— GERMAN SHORT PASTE. 

Take eight ounces of almond paste, eight 
ounces of flour, eight ounces of cake crumbs, six 
ounces of sugar, four ounces of butter, four eggs, 
the grated rind of one lemon, half a teaspoon of 



ground cloves and cinnamon, and a pinch of powd- 
ered ammonia. 

Rub the butter into the flour and mix with the 
sugar and the spices; soften the almond paste 
with the eggs; add the lemon rind and ammonia 
and mix all together into a smooth paste. Put 
away in a jar well covered in a cold place. 

85.— STEAMED DUMPLING PASTE, NO. i. 

Twenty-four ounces of flour, one ounce of 
baking powder, six ounces of butter, four eggs, 
two ounces of sugar, the grated rind of one lemon, 
a little mace, milk to mix. 

Work the ingredients same as for tea biscuit 
mixture, and use. 

86.— SUET DUMPLING PASTE, NO. 2. 

Two pounds of flour, one ounce of baking 
powder, eight ounces of finely chopped suet, two 
eggs, pinch of salt, flavor. 

Mix with milk into a medium firm paste and use. 

One pound of bread crumbs may be used, and 
only one pound of flour for this paste. 

87.— ROLLED DUMPLING PASTE, NO. 3. 

Twenty-four ounces of flour, eight ounces of 
butter, two eggs, the grated rind of one lemon, a 
little mace, pinch of salt, milk to mix, and one 
ounce of baking powder. 

Mix the baking powder with a handful of the 
flour and keep it back for dusting. Chop the but- 
ter in the rest of the flour and add the lemon 
rind, mace and salt. Mix the eggs with a little 
milk and sprinkle over the flour, then shake the 
mixture together same as for pie crust. Put on 
the table, dust with the flour and baking powder, 
roll out thin and give two turns (twice three fold- 
ings) like for Puff Paste (No. 73), then it is ready 
for use. All three pastes may be used for Meat 
Dumplings. 

88.— GUM-PASTE (PASTILLAGE). 

Put two ounces of gum tragacanth to soak in a 
cup of water, cover and let it stand in a warm 
place for about two days. When the gum has ab- 
sorbed all the water press it through <i cloth. 
Mix on the marble slab with one pound of icing 
sugar and work smooth. Put away in a jar and 
cover with a damp cloth. 

If the paste is to be used for lozenges, work in 
two pounds of icing sugar, with flavor and color 
to suit. 

For ornamental work add starch powder in the 
same proportions in place of the sugar. This 
makes a nice pliable elastic paste which can 
easily be molded wiih the fingers into any shape, 
or pressed in molds £0; figure work, and may b6 
colored any shade, /f the paste is too firm it 
may be softened with even portions of starch and 
water mixed together and added to the paste. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



Using this paste requires quick work to prevent 
drying and crusting. 

89 — CROQUANT PASTE. 

This paste is mostly used for making orna- 
mental pieces, because it keeps its shape well if 
properly baked. The paste may be used to make 
baskets and also other ornaments which require a 
foundation. 

Take two pounds of flour, one pound of fine 
icing sugar, and two ounces of butter; rub all 
well together and work together with about nine 
or tt n whites of eggs into a smooth but firm paste. 
Put away well covered in a cool place. 

go.— ALMOND PASTE (MARCIPAN), 

Take one pound and twelve ounces of blanched 
swen almonds and four ounces bitter almonds; 
let I en whiten in cold water over night. Wipe 
th'' B munds dry and pound in a mortar to a fine 
sm. 1 I paste. Add some water if too dry. Put

or iw/o pounds more of powdered sugar to form a 
pliable pa.'^te. It may be formed in small rolls or 
cut in stars and rings or any fancy shapes. They 
are baked in a medium heat to a nice golden 
brown color. 

If this paste is intended for ornamenting and 
for large pieces, one ounce of gum tragacanth 
may be added in solution while the paste is warm, 
and it may be worked like the Gum-paste (N0.88). 
inio baskets and croquant pieces. 

91. -MERINGUE PASTES. 

Meringue pastes are used in a variety of ways 
in pastry and cake making. The soft meringues 
with less sugar are used largely for pies and 
puddings. The hard meringues are baked on 
papers and pans; and others again on paper-cov- 
ered boards. The meringue boards should be of 
non-resinous wood about one or two inches thick 
and cut so the> can be put to soak in the sink be- 
fore using. These boards are used to bake mer- 
ingue shells for Easter eggs, and for baskets, etc. 

Meringues require a very cool oven : too much 
heat causes the paste to burst and color before it 
is sufiSciently baked. 

ITALIAN MERINGUES are made with a 
syrup. The sugar is boiled to the blow degree, 
and poured hot in a thin stream into the beaten- 
up whites and then beaten cool. 

For the FRENCH MERINGUE, both sugar 
and whites are beaten together on a slow fire, 
warm till firm, and then bea m cold. 

These meringue pastes arr used for the same 
purpose as the others, only with the difference 
that the hot pastes dry il less time than the 
pastes made by the cold process. 



92.— COLD MERINGUE PASTE. 

To obtain a good paste have the egg whites 
fresh and cold, the sugar dry and well sifted, the 
utensils (basin or kettle, and beater) perfectly 
clean and dry. 

A cold dry place is the most suitable for the 
beating. 

Beat slow at the start (do not stir) and increase 
the speed gradually. When the whites get firm 
add a small handful of the sugar and continue the 
beating till the mixture can be drawn to a point. 
Beat in another handful of the sugar and continue 
so till about one-third or one-fourth part of the 
sugar is beaten into the mixture. Add flavoring 
and mix in the rest of the sugar. Draw it in 
lightly, but avoid stirring too much, which would 
soften the paste and make it flow and run flat. 

The pastes may be colored to suit before all 
the sugar is beaten into the mixture. 

93.— MERINGUE PASTE, NO. i. 

One pint of whites of eggs, one pound and 
eight ounces powdered sugar or fine granulated 
sugar. Flavor.

Beat the whites of six eggs firm. 

When the sugar has reached the degree, rub a 
part of it on the side of the kettle till it loses its 
clearness and begins to grain. Stir this in the 
other syrup and pour it in a thin stream into the 
whites, stirring constantly. Add the flavor and 
beat cold. 

This meringue is used much for ices and in 
punches. 

96— FF.ENCH MERINGUE PASTE. 

Two pounds of powdered sugar, one pint of 
whites of eggs. 

Put the sugar and whites together in a basin, 
and set m a pan with hot water, or on a slow fire, 
and beat the mixture till it stands up well. Take 
off the fire and beat cold for a minute and use like 
the other pastes 

97.— CHARLOTTE RUSSE CRUST PASTE 
(YELLOW). 

One pint of whites of eggs, half pint of yolks, 
one pound of powdered sugar, one pound of flour, 
vanilla flavor, half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 

Retain a handful of the sugar to be beaten in 
the whites. 

Sift flour, sugar and cream of tartar together. 
Beat the whites to a firm froth, and beat in the 
retained sugar. Beat in the flavor and add the 
yolks gradually Miy in the flour and sugar

a large flat tube on baking sheets covered water come to a full boil before adding the flour; 



with maniUa paper. Bake in a medium heat. 
(A too hot oven will brown and blister the mix- 
ture; too cool will cause drying out). 

The crust should be soft and pliable when baked. 
98.— CHARLOTTE RUSSE CRUST PASTE 
(WHITE). 

One pound four ounces of powdered sugar, 
twelve ounces of flour, one teaspoonful of cream 
of tartar, one and one-half pints of egg whites, 
vanilla flavor. 

Proceed with this mixture the same as for the 
yellow crust, and bake in the same manner. 



or not stirring the paste sufficiently on the fire to 
overcome the insufficient boiling in the first place. 
To have it come to a full boil it is best to measure 
a little more than the quart of water given in the 
recipe, to allow for evaporation. After the eggs 
are added the mixture should be dressed with 
bag and tube on greased and dusted pans and baked 
as quick as possible. If for puffs, washed with 
egg-wash and baked in a good heat. If the pu&s 
become crusty and cold before going in the oven 
they do not crack as nicely as they should, to 
have the right appearance. For eclairs, which 



The baked crust will keep for several days if require a smooth top, it is preferable to let them 



kept in an air-tight tin box in a cool place. 

99-— GERMAN NUDLE PASTE (NOODLE 
PASTE). 

The paste may be made from yolks only and 
also from whole eggs. 

Break as many eggs as wanted into a bowl ; flavor 
with a pinch of salt and nutmeg and work in 
sufficient flour to make a very firm paste. Let it 
rest for some time before using. 

100.— RAISED PIE PASTE, COLD. 

Two pounds of flour, eight ounces of butter, 
half ounce of salt, four yolks, three whole eggs, a 
scant pint of water. Mix as directed in No. 8i. 
loi.— RAISED PIE PASTE, HOT. 

Two pounds of flour, six ounces of butter or 
lard, half ounce of salt, one scant pint of water. 
Sift the flour iu the bowl; make a bay in the 
center. Let the water and butter come to a boil 
and mix it with the flour into a firm but smooth 
paste. These two pastes are used for large hot 
or cold Meat Pies, and also for the small Mutton 
and Pork Pies. 

102.— CREAM PUFF PASTE. 

One quart of water, one pound of lard, one 
pound eight ounces of flour, twenty-six to thirty 
eggs, a pinch of powdered ammonia (about one- 
eighth ounce). Put the lard and water together, 
with a pinch of salt, into a shallow saucepan 
and let come to a good boil. Stir in the sifted 
flour, and, with the spatula, mix into a smooth 
paste. Take off the fire, put the paste in the 
mixing bowl, let cool a little, and work the eggs 
gradually in the warm paste (which should be soft 
when finished, but not soft enough to run flat on 
the pan) . Add the ammonia after the eggs are all in. 

The mixture takes more or less eggs according 
to the strength of the flour. Some bakers add a 
little milk in the last part of the mixing to save eggs. 

For Eclairs the mixture may be made a little 
firmer than for pnffs. 

This paste is not very hard to prepare, but 
many fail in their first attempts at making it. 



stand for some time after they are dressed on the 
pans, so they bake up with a smooth top. 
103.— CREAM PUFF PASTE. 

One quart of water, one pound four ounces of 
lard, one pound eight ounces of flour, one and 
one-half pints of eggs, half pint of milk, pinch of 
salt, pinch of ammonia.

ounces of sugar, one pound of flour, fifteen eggs. 

Prepare same as No. 102. Fry in hot lard. 
106.— FRIED WAFFLE PASTE. 

One pound four ounces of flour, two ounces of 
sugar, one pint of milk, seven eggs, lemon flavor 
and cinnamon. 

Separate the eggs, mix flour, sugar, yolks and 
milk to a soft batter, add the whites beaten to a 
firm froth 

This batter is used for sweet fried cases and 
fried spring waffles. 

107.— ROMAN CASE PASTE. 

One pound of flour, four ounces of cornstarch, 
one pint of milk, four eggs, pinch of salt. 

Mix same as No. 106. 

In using these pastes, the irons used should be 
put in the hot grease or oil before dipping them 
in the batter. Dip the hot iron in the batter, 
close to the edge, but not above, and put in the 
hot grease again; fry to a nice color. The cases 
will drop off the iron easily by knocking on the iron. 

Case from batter No. 106 may be used for 
fancy souffles and creams. 

The spring waffles may be served for breakfast 
like other waffles, dusted with powdered sugar

sweetmeats or with a rich cream for a sweet 

entree or dessert. 

No. 107 is used the same way as patty cases for 
oysters, sweetbreads, salads, etc. 

loS.— BATTER PASTE FOR SWEET 
FRITTERS. 

One pound of flour, three ounces of sugar, one 
teaspoon of baking powder, two eggs- 
Mix with milk to a medium batter; add a spoon- 
ful of melted butter and a pinch of salt.

eggs, pinch of salt. ' 

Mix with milk to a soft batter. 

This batter is used also for vegetables, 
no.— CREAM FILLINGS FOR PIES, TAJITS, 
AND CAKES ..f^' j-^. 

The fillings can be made of more :wUfes| rich- 
ness, to suit the price obtained for the gopdg. If 
less eggs are used in the fillings, another tTkici^- 
ing must be substituted in the form of starch,' or 
flour. In this manner lemon pie and other cream 
fillings can be made with two or three yolks to 
the quart, instead o.f using six or eight yolks, us- 
ing more starch and a little more butter. Fruit 
fillings may also be iiade less expensive in this 
manner. Some large bakeries use a cream filling 
made from water, eggs and starch or flour in the 
hot season, which has better keeping qualities 
than milk creams, which sour readily in summer. 
III.— ALMOND AND NUT CREAM FILLING. 

One pint of rich milk or cream, eight yolks, 
four ounces of chopped and browned almonds or 
nuts, eight ounces of sugar, one ounce of corn- 
starch. 

Mix the sugar, yolks and starch and add the 

milk. Set on the fire and stir constantly till it 

thickens, but do not let it boil. Add the nuts and 

vanilla flavor. Let cool and use for filling. 

112.— CHOCOLATE NUT CREAM, OR 

CARAMEL NUT CREAM. 

Add to No. Ill one ounce of powdered cocoa or 
some caramel. 

113— ALMOND FILLING NO. i. 

Half a pound of almond paste, four ounces of 
browned and crushed almonds, eight ounces of 
sugar, half a. pint of milk, two ounces of butter, 
six eggs. 

Rub the almond paste soft with the eggs, add

the milk and stir till it thickens. Let cool, flavor 

with vanilla and use for layer cakes and tart filling, 

114.— ALMOND FILLING NO. 2. 

Six ounces almond paste, four ounces of dry 
macaroons powdered, one pint of milk. 

Boil on a slow fire to a cream, and mix with a 



and eight ounces of powdered sugar. Mix and 
let cool and use for filling. 

115.— NUT FILLING NO. 1. 

Four ounces of crushed nuts, eight ounces of 
sugar, four ounces of butter, five eggs, the grated 
rind of one lemon, little ground cinnamon. 

Break the eggs in the saucepan, beat up with 
the sugar, butter and spices, add the nuts, put on 
the fire and stir till it thickens. Let cool and use. 

Chocolate may be added for chocolate filling. 
1x6.— NUT FILLING NO. 2. 

One pound of brown sugar, one pound of 
crushed nuts, twelve eggs, half a teaspoonful of 
ground cloves and cinnamon. 

Put the sugar with half a pint of water on the 
fire and boil to a syrup. Pour it into the well 
beaten eggs and mix in the nuts and spices. 
Add a few cakecrumbs for thickening. Let cool 
and use. 

117.— COCO ANUT FILLING. 

One pound of fine chopped cocoanut, eight 
ounces of sugar, four ounces of butter, two ounces 
of cornstarch, half pint of milk. 

Mix the starch with half of the sugar, set the 
milk and butter to boil with the other half of the 
sugar, let boil and mix with the starch and nuts. 
Flavor with vanilla. Let cool and use. 
118.— ORANGE FILLING. 

One pound of sugar, one pint of white wine, 
four oranges, two lemons, two ounces of butter, 
two ounces of cornstarch, sixteen yolks of eggs. 

Put the yolks in the saucepan, mix with sugar 
and starch, add the butter, the grated rind of the 
oranges, and the juice of the lemons and oranges. 
Stir on the fire till it thickens; take off and let cool. 

Make a Lemon Filling in the same manner, us- 
ing six lemons, rind and juice, leaving out the 
oranges. 

119.— PLAIN LEMON FILLING. 

One pound of sugar, half pint of water, two 
ounces of cornstarch, two ounces of butter, eight 
yolks, juice and rind of four lemons. 

Prepare same as No. 118. 
120.— LEMON AND ORANGE BUTTER 
FILLING. 

One pound of sugar, eight ounces of butter, 
three oranges, two lemons, five yolks and five 
whole eggs. 

Grate the orange rind on the sugar, press the 
juice from the oranges and lemons, mix in the

juice. 

121.— PINEAPPLE FILLING. 

One pint of grated pineapple, eight ounces of 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 15 



sugar, two ounces of butter, {our yolks, one 
ounce of cornstarch, the juice of one orange. 

Mix all the ingredients together, put on the fire 
and stir till it thickens. 

122.— VIENNA CREAM FILLING NO. i. 

Five eggs, twelve ounces sugar, eight ounces of 
white butter. 

Beat eggs and sugar together on the fire till it 
thickens; take oQ at once and beat cold on ice. 

Take white fresh country butter without salt, 
stir it to a light cream, then aad gradually, beat- 
ing constantly, the egg cream; flavor with manilla. 

Cakes and tarts filled with this cream should 
be kept in a cold place. 

This cream may be used like hard sauce for 
puddings; and can be used for decorative pur- 
poses in many ways. 

123— VIENNA CREAM FILLING NO. 2. 

Twelve ounces of icing sugar (XXXX pow- 
dered), eight ounces of white butter. 

Beat the sugar and butter to a light cream,add 
ing rum or maraschino for flavor, or any suitable 
liquor or flavor. 

This filling is used 'for decorating cakes and 

tarts, also for fancy cold puddings. It may be 

colored to suit; and with powdered cocoa it makes 

a nice rich chocolate cream filling and icing. 

124.- FRUIT PASTES FOR FILLING 

LAYER CAKES. 

To give fruit jellies and jams more firmness 
for a filling, they may be mixed with sifted cake- 
crumbs and sugar. 

Cakecrumbs may be made into a filling by add- 
ing fruit syrup or plain syrup; season with spices, 
chocolate or nuts. 

A nice maple filling for tarts and layer cakes 
may be made with maple syrup, crumbs and a 
few nuts. 

125.— TARTLET CRUMB FILLING. 

Take eight ounces of sugar, eight ounces of 
butter. Rub to a cream with half a pint of eggs 
and half a pint of milk; mix with cake-crumbs to 
a soft batter. Flavor this mixture with either 
lemon, orange, vanilla, or chocolate, or add 
chopped peel or nuts. This makes a variety of 
fillings for small tarts. 

It may be used also for a pie filling and baked 
like custard pies, decorated with meringue or jelly . 
126.— PASTRY CREAMS. 
The cream fillings for puSs, layers and piesi 
may be made with flour or cornstarch. They can 
be mixed dry with half of the sugar and added to 
the boiling liquid; or it may be mixed into a soft ' 
paste with cold milk or water and added in this 
manner. The yolks of eggs are used to enrich 
and thicken the creams for this reason: if more 
yolks are used the cream requires less starch; 
and if less yolks are used, more starch. 



The creams made with flour should be well 
cooked so as to lose the raw flour taste. Good 
cornstarch has hardly any flavor, thickens more 
readily and makes better creams. 

127.— CREAM PUFF FILLING. 

One quart of milk, ten ounces of sugar, two 
ounces of butter, three ounces of cornstarch, six 
yolks, a pinch of salt. 

Dissolve the starch in a . 
mix with the yolks. Put^

130 —PATTY CASES NO. I. 
Take good pufi paste, roll it oat not quite one- 
quarter of an inch thickness, and cut out for 
large size patties with a three-inch cutter. Put 
on wet baking pans a little distance apart. Mark 
the center with a smaller cutter of one inch less 
diameter, and set in a cold place to rest for fifteen 
to twenty minutes. 

Before baking wash the patties with an egg- 
wash and bake in a brisk heat of about 400 to 450 
degrees Fahr. in an empty oven without steam. 

In washing the patties, care should be taken 
that the wash does not run down the sides of the 
paste (only the top should be washed). The run- 
ning down prevents the paste from rising evenly 
in the oven during baking. 

When the patties are baked, lift the top care- 
fully and take out the soft inside paste to make 
room for the filling. 

131.— PATTY CASES NO. 2. 
Another way of making the patties is to make 
them in three pieces instead of cutting them out 
in one piece. 



i6 



PAUL RICHARDS BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



Roll out a very thin sheet of the paste, to one- 
sixteenth of an inch thickness. With a cutter a 
little larger than three inches diameter cut out 
circulars and put on a wet baking sheet. Roll 
out another sheet of paste one-quarter inch thick- 
ness, and cut in three-inch circulars. With a 
two-inch cutter cut rings from the three-inch 
pieces, wash the cut-out bottoms first with water 
and put on the rings. Set in a cool place to rest 
for fifteen minutes. . Then wash the top of the 
rings and bake same as directed for the other 
patties. 

For the tops, roll out the trimmings into a thin 
sheet, cut in two-inch round pieces, put on pan 
wash over and bake. 
132.— VOL-AU-VENT(LARGE PATTY CASES). 

Vol-au-vents are very large patty cases often 
made so large as to hold from one to two quarts of 
filling (which may consist of the regular filling of 
oysters, chicken, etc., or of a filling of game birds 
as for other large meat pies. 

Vol-au-vents are mostly served for parties and 
large dinners. 

Roll out the puff paste into a sheet one inch 
thickness, and put it on a wet baking pan, Put a 
round or oval plate, a little larger than you want 
the case to be, on top of the paste, and cut with a 
sharp knife around the sides to trim off the sur- 
plus paste. Take off the plate and make another 
circular cut of one inch less diameter (but do not 
cut through) to form the cover. Set the patty in 
the ice box to rest for twenty minutes. When 
ready to bake wash with a light egg-wash and 
bake in a good heat. 

To obtain a very high case it is best to set a 
ring of stiff paper around the case during the first 
part of the baking. It should be about five inches 
high and two inches larger in diameter. This 
gives the case more time to rise before it bakes 
on the sides and makes it bake up more evenly. 

[The small patties are termed petits vols-au-vent 
and petits bouchees]. 

The vols-au-vent and the smaller patty cases are 
also used for sweet pastry. Filled with whipped 
cream and fresh fruits they make very acceptable 
desserts. 

133.— TARTS AND TARTLETS. 

The tarts and tartlets may be made like the 
patty cases, from puff paste, baked, and the pre- 
pared filling put in after baking; or small patty 
tins may be lined with puff or tart pastes, and 
baked with the filling. If the shells in the tins 
are baked before the filling is put in, it is best to 
dust the lined tins with a little fiour and fill up 
with beans, or little balls of flour paste. Bake 
the shells and remove the beans or the paste to 
make room for the filling. This prevents the 



shrinking of the paste in baking. The beans can 
be used over again for the same purpose. 

In England the term Tart is generally applied 
to small fruit pies; and tartlet to the small tarts 
baked in the fluted patty tins. Here in America 
the tarts are baked in the small tins; and small 
patty cases are also termed Tarts and Tartlets, if 
they are filled with sweets. 

In the German and the French, tart is changed 

into torte and tourte respectively, and means 

either a large fruit or cream pie, made in the 

open fashion from rich tart or puff paste; or it 

means a rich round layer cake with cream or fruit 

filling. The tortes from puff paste are made with 

a cover of narrow strips of paste, put on lattice 

fashion; the layer cakes are iced and fancifully 

decorated with French fruits glaces and other 

ornaments. 

134 —APPLE PIE. 

Roll out a bottom from pie paste No. 80, line 
the greased pie tins with it and fill with the fruit. 

Nice ripe cooking apples require no previous 
cooking. Slice the apples very thin, season with 
nutmeg, allspice or cinnamon; sprinkle about two 
handfuls of sugar over the apples in each pie; 
distribute a little butter in small bits over the 
apples. 

Use plenty of fruit to make a well filled pie. 

Brush the edge of the rim with water. Roll 
out a cover from paste No. 79 for the top crust. 
Mark the crust with the letter of the fruit which 
the pie contains. (Pie bakers use a stamp for 
this purpose). Make a few small cuts in the 
paste to serve as steam vents during baking. 
Fold the cover in two and cover the pie. 

Press the top and bottom pastes well together 
on the sides; trim off the surplus paste with the 
hands, or use a knife for this purpose. 

Before putting in the oven wash over with some 
milk in which one yolk of egg has been well 
beaten; this gives the pies a nice color. 

An even baking heat of 350 to 400 degrees 
Fahrenheit is best suitable for fruit pies. 

Some apples require to be stewed before using. 
Peel core and slice the apples, stew with a little 
water till tender, add sugar and flavor and let 
cool before filling in the pies. 

135.— SLICED APPLE PIE. 

This pie, like the other, can be made from 
fresh or stewed fruit. Line the pie tin with paste 
No. 80 and trim off the surplus paste. Put the 
fruit on the paste in an even layer and sweeten 
and season to taste. Roll out some top paste No. 
79, (or use puff paste cut in strips about one inch 
wide). Wash the edge of the paste in the pie 
and put on the strips in lattice fashion. Put also 
a strip around the edge. Brush over with egg 
wash, and bake.

hotel and restaurant service. Take the oval 
china vegetable dishes, or the brown pudding 
dishes, fill with the fresh or stewed fruit, put 
on a cover from paste No. 79, cut a few holes 
in the top-crust to serve as a steam vent, brush 
over with egg, wash and bake to a nice color. 

In England.for large pies of this kind, it is custo- 
mary to put an inverted cup in the center of the 
pie or pudding, to take up the juice during bak- 
ing and prevent boiling over. For smaller pies a 
tube of stiff paper may be inserted in the center, 
which answers the same purpose. 
137.— PEAR PIE. 
PEACH PIE. 
APRICOT PIE. 
QUINCE PIE. 

Nice soft pears can be used without stewing; 
other pears should be stewed and cooled before 
using. 

Peaches and apricots are peeled, sliced and the 
stones removed; baked with a full cover and also 
like the sliced apple pie. 

For quinces, peel, core and slice the fruit, stew 
till tender. Half apples and half quinces makes 
a very nice pie. Bake like apple pie. 
138.— BERRY PIES. 

All berries should be washed and picked over 
to remove sand and other impurities. Some 
berries contain very much juice, and for these 
berries it is best to put a thin layer of crumbs in 
bottom of the pie, before putting on the fruit, to 
retain the juice. 

The best way to make berry pies for hotels and 
restaurants is to make them like the English apple 
pie, in deep dishes, with a top cover only, and 
serve the pie in the dish. We used to make fine 
pies this way in New York hotels twenty years 
ago and they proved very good sellers. 

If berries are baked in the flat pies with top 
and bottom crust, the juice often makes the bot- 
tom soggy and soft. When cut into portions it 
runs out and much of it is lost; while in the deep 
dishes all the juice is retained, and a berry pie 
can be made with more fruit in it. 

Fill the dish with strawberries, raspberries, 
currants, blueberries, blackberries or grapes; 
sweeten to taste; wet the edge of the dish, put on 
a cover from top crust paste, make a few cuts in 
it, wash over and bake. 

To blue- and blackberries a little water may be 
added; the other berries named require no water. 



The gooseberry pies are baked with a full cover. 
140.— RHUBARB PIE. 

The young tender stalks require no peeling; 
otherwise peel off the outer skin; cut up in small 
pieces. To each pound of rhubarb add twelve 
ounces of sugar and one ounce of cornstarch, the 
grated rind of one lemon or orange; mix well to- 
gether and fill in the bottoms; bake with strips 
like the cranberry pie, or with a full cover. 

Pufi paste may be used for strip covers. For 
a full cover the rich pie crust is better; it makes 
a better crust. Pufi paste is too light and easily 
softens from the steam which arises during baking, 
and the crusts gets soft after standing for some- 
time. 

141.— BANANA PIE. 

Peel and slice the bananas very thin; add sugar, 
a little fresh butter, the juice of some oranges or 
lemons, and a pinch of allspice; or flavor with 
some good rum. Bake with a full crust, or with 
a meringue cover. 

142.— PINEAPPLE PIE. 

Peel and core ripe pineapple and cut in thin 
slices; stew till clear in a light syrup; flavor with 
a little grated orange peel; let cool and bake with 
a strip cover like sliced apple pie. 

Grated canned pineapple may be used like 
other fruit. 

143.— FRUIT MERINGUE PIES. 

All the fruit pies can be made into meringue 
pies by baking them open, without cover of any 
crust, and decorate with Meringue Paste No. 93. 

Put the paste in a bag, use a plain or star tube; 
put on strips in lattice fashion and a border 
around the edge; dust with powdered sugar and 
put back in the oven for a minute to color. 

The other way to make fruit meringue pies is to 
bake the bottoms, as described in No. 74, fill 
with the ready stewed fruit, put on the meringue 
paste and give some color in the oven. 
144.— BOSTON LEMON PIE. 

One pound of sugar, sixteen eggs, six lemons. 

Bake the bottoms to a very light color. Grate 
the rind of four lemons on half of the sugar, add 
the yolks of the eggs and the juice of all the lem- 
ons, stir together on the fire till it thickens, then 
take ofi the fire. Beat the whites of eggs and 
make a meringue with the other half of the sugar. 
Mix yolks and whites together and fill in the baked 
crusts; sift some powdered sugar over and put

in a slack oven for twenty to twenty-five minutes. 
The pie pu&s up and falls a little after baking, 
but makes a delicious pie. 

145.— LEMON MERINGUE PIE. 

One quart of water, one pound of sugar, five 
lemons, five yolks, three and one-half ounces of 
cornstarch, two ounces of butter. 

Grate the rind of three lemons onto the sugar; 
dissolve the starch in a little cold water and mix 
with the yolks. Put sugar, water, lemon rind 
and juice, and the butter to boil. When it boils 
add starch and yolks and stir till it thickens. 
Take off the fire and fill in the previously baked 
bottoms. 

Use the whites of the eggs for the meringue, 
one ounce of sugar for each white of egg (or use 
Meringue Paste No. 93). 

Spread some of the paste over the cream after 
it has cooled, with the palette knife. Put the 
other paste in the dressing bag and put on a 
border; dust with powdered sugar and put in the 
oven to color. 

The same mixture may be used for covered 
pies; or only half boiled and filled in lined bot- 
toms, baked like custard pie. The mixture may 
be made more or less rich, using more yolks and 
less starch. 

The cheapest lemon pies are made with lemon 
extract and acid; no lemons; leaving out the eggs 
and using color; but the juice and grated rind 
only will produce the true flavor. 

146.— ORANGE MERINGUE PIE. 

The orange pie is made in the same manner as 

Ho. X45, using the rind of one orange only and the 

jUice of three oranges and two lemons. The one 

quart mixture makes about three good size pies. 

147.— PINEAPPLE MERINGUE PIE. 

The pineapple pie may be made like the lemon 
pie No. 145, using one quart of water and one 
quart of pineapple grated; or, for a richer pie, 
use the following mixture: Take one quart of 
grated pineapple (unsweetened), twelve ounces 
of sugar, the juice and rind of one lemon, two 
ounces of cornstarch, four ounces of butter and 
six yolks. Stir together on the fire till it thick- 
ens and fill into the baked bottoms; cover with a 
network or full cover of meringue; sprinkle over 
a few chopped almonds, dust with powdered 
sugar and put in the oven to color. 
148.— CREAM PIES. 

One quart of milk, eight yolks, eight ounces of 
sugar, two ounces of cornstarch, one ounce of 
bntter. 

Dissolve the starch in a little cold milk and stir 
with the yolks. Set the milk on the fire with the 
sugar and butter. Mix now a little of the hot 
milk with the starch and yolks, and when the 



milk and sugar come to a boil add the yolks and 
starch and stir till it thickens. Take o£E the fire 
and add the flavor and fill into the baked crusts. 
Finish like the Lemon Meringue Pie. 

This recipe will make all the different cream 
pies by changing the flavors. For Vanilla Cream 
Pie add vanilla extract; for Lemon, the grated 
rind of lemon, etc. 

A very light cream is obtained by adding the 
beaten whites of flve eggs to the cream. As soon 
as it begins to thicken mix the whites well in the 
cream and take off the fire. 

149.— COCOANUT CREAM PIE. 

Add four ounces of grated cocoanut to the 
above mixture (No. 148) in the boiling milk and 
flavor with vanilla. 

150.— ALMOND CREAM PIE. 

Flavor cream No. 148 vanilla, add four ounces of 
browned and crushed almonds and sprinkle a few 
chopped almonds on top of the meringue. 
151.— CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE. 

Add two ounces of cocoa powder to No. 148, 
dissolve with the sugar and boil with the milk. 
Flavor with vanilla. 

Finish the pies with a cover of meringue, or 
put the meringue on lattice fashion, with a border 
of dots, and brown lightly in the oven. 
IS2.— STRAWBERRY CREAM MERINGUE 
PIE. 

Make the vanilla cream, but fill the baked bot- 
toms only half full with the cream. Put on a 
layer of ripe strawberries, sprinkle with sugar, 
and over the berries put a network or make a 
full cover of Meringue Paste No. 93, and put in 
the oven for a minute to color. 

If RASPBERRIES are used, the pie would be 
called Raspberry Cream Meringue Pie. 

Very ripe PEACHES may also be used in this 
manner. 

153.— CREAM PIES WITH PRESERVED 
FRJITS. 

When the fresh fruit gives out, the preserved 
fruits may be used for the cream pies. Fresh 
fruit, like blackberries, grapes or cherries, may 
be made into a compote and nsed for the pies. 
The pies may be given the name of the caterer, 
or the hotel, and called Grand Hotel Meringue 
Pie or Delmonico Meringue Pie, etc. 
134.— STRAWBERRY PIE WITH WHIPPED 
CREAM. 
RASPBERRY PIE WITH WHIPPED 
CREAM. 

Bake the bottoms as usual, but use the richer 
top crust, or the Short Paste No. 82. Sweeten 
the berries with powdered sugar and fill into the 
baked bottoms. Whip some double cream to a 
stiff froth, sweeten and flavor and spread over

the berries. Decorate with bag and tube like 
meringue pie and serve. 

This delicious pie may be served as a Shortcake. 
155.— DAIRY CREAM PIES. 

These pies may be made like the Cream Piss 
with Preserved Fruits No. 153. One thin layer 
of pastry cream, one layer of preserved fruit, and 
the top finished with whipped cream in place of 
meringue. 

For better keeping quality a charlotte russe 
mixture may be used, with a little gelatine in it 
to make a more solid cream. 

Of course, pies like this should be kept in a 
cold place to prevent the softening of the cream. 

For special orders the pies may be decorated 
with fancy designs with the plain or star tube; 
with candied fruits, or withapipingof fruit jelly, 
which makes a nice efiect. 

A special name may be devised for this pie for 
certain occasions. 

156.— MARTHA WASHINGTON PIE. 

Bake a layer or sponge cake mixture in the 
regular pie tins. Let cool and split in halves; 
fill with a vanilla or nut cream; put together and 
ice like a layer cake. Take some clear currant 
jelly, press it through a cloth, put some of the 
jelly in a paper cornet and decorate the pie with 
a fancy border or other design. 

157.— FLORADORA CREAM PIE. 

Bake a layer of white cake mixture or angel 
cake, put on a thiok layer of the floradora cream, 
cover with a meringue, put a few shredded al- 
monds on top, dust with powdered sugar and put 
in the oven for a minute to color. 

Make the cream as follows: Take one pint of 
grated pineapple, one pint of sliced pineapple cut 
in dices, four ounces of cocoanut, two ounces of 
starch, four ounces of butter, eight yolks of eggs, 
eight ounces of sugar, the grated rind of one 
orange and the juice of two. Mix the ingredients 
together and stir on the fire till it thickens, let 
cool and use. 
158.— DRESDEN CREAM MERINGUE PIE. 

Put eight ounces of Sultana or seeded Malaga 
raisins with half a pint of sherry wine and two 
ounces of sugar in a stew pan, and let slowly sim- 
mer on the back of the stove till the raisins have 
absorbed all the wine and sugar. Line a deep 
custard pie tin or layer-cake tin with pufi-paste, 
and put a strip of the paste around the edge. 

Make a custard in the following manner: Take 
three pints of rich milk, twelve ounces of sugar, 
four ounces of almond paste, ten yolks and three 
ounces of cornstarch. Soften the almond paste 
with one egg till smooth, dissolve the starch in a 
little milk. Set the other milk and sugar on the 
fire; mix the paste, starch and yolks well to- 



gether, and when the milk comes to a boil take ofi 
the fire and stir it into the yolks, starch and paste; 
flavor with vanilla. 

Fill the lined pie bottom with the raisins, pour 
over the custard and bake as usual. 

Use the whites for the meringue paste and dec- 
orate when done; or the pie may be served plain 
like a custard pie. 

159.— CUSTARD PIES. 

Line the deep custard pie tins with paste No.St. 
Force up the edge of the paste, pinch up above the 
top, notch it to form a fancy rim and fill with the 
prepared custard.

SWEET POTATO PIE is also made and sea* 
soned like Pumpkin Pie.

167.— FRUIT CUSTARD PIES. 
The fruit custard pies are made similar to the 
fruit cream pies, only a good strong custard takes 
the place of the cream, and the pies are baked 
like the Custard Pies. 



Brandy is used in the mince meat for flavor, 
and also to preserve the mixture, and prevent 
fermentation. 

In the making of the mince meat, much of the 
orange and lemon peel may be used which is left 



The preserved fruits and the compotes of fruit "-from making fruit ices (instead of buying candied 



given in preceding chapters are most suitable for 
this class of pies. 

The pies are served plain baked. 

Line the pie tins with the custard or short 
paste crust, arrange the fruit in an even layer on 
the paste, and fill the pies in the oven with the 
custard by means of a long handled dipper, and 
bake in a medium heat. 

A large variety of fruit custard pies may be 
made in this manner, which should find a ready 
sale at restaurants and lunch counters. 
168.— PRUNE PIES. 

Evaporated prunes should be soaked over night, 
stewed till soft and the stones removed; sweeten 
to taste, flavor with cinnamon and the grated 
rind and juic6 of lemon; let cool and bake like the 
Apple Pies. 

i6g.— RAISIN PIE. 

Raisin Pies are made in several ways. The 
large Malaga raisins have the best flavor and 
make the best pie. Cut the raisins in two and 
take out the seeds (or use seeded raisins). Soak 
over night, or for about six hours. For each 
pound of raisins take the grated rind and juice of 
one lemon, and from four to six ounces of sugar. 
Stew the raisins till clear; let cool; fill into the 
lined bottoms, put on the cover and bake like 
other pies. 

The other way is to take the seeded raisins, 
some preserved orange or lemon peel and some 
currants, and chop fine like mince meat; season 
with allspice, sweeten with brown sugar and thin 
up with cider, then bake like a mince pie. 

If some stale cake or crackers are added to this 
mixture it makes an excellent MOCK MINCE PIE. 
170.— MINCE PIE. 

Make the mince pie like the Apple Pie with a 
full cover, and serve hot or cold. 

171.— MINCE MEAT. 

The making of mince meat requires a good 
deal of work in its preparation. It -improves in 
flavor with age and keeps in good condition for 
several months if properly made. For this rea- 
son it is best if made in a large quantity to last 
for the season, which is generally from Thanks- 
giving till Easter. 

The commercial article differs greatly in qual- 
ity. The best is equal to the home-made article. 
The cheapest is an uncertain mush, seasoned 
with spices. 

The best tart apples, good beef suet and meat 
and a good quality of spices should be used. 



peel), preparing it in the manner given in the 
chapters on Preserved Fruits. 

I give here a recipe for a large quantity of 
mince meat, which may be reduced to one-half or 
one-fourth for smaller quantities: 

Take five pounds of lean beef, boil, and when 
cold, chop fine; 

Five pounds of suet clear of strings and 
chopped fine; 

Two bushels of apples, peeled, cored and 
chopped fine; 

Five pounds of seeded raisins. 

Four pounds of orange peel. 

Four pounds of citron peel cut up fine, 

Ten pounds of currants. 

Five pounds of Sultanas. 

Mix these with twenty pounds of brown sugar. 

One quart of brandy and 

One quart of sherry. 

Four gallons of cider, 

One pound of mixed spices — mace, cloves, aut- 
meg, ginger and cinnamon, 

One ounce of salt. 

One ounce of pepper. 

Put into a whiskey barrel, or in a couple of 
very large jars and keep in a cold place. 

When making pies add a little more liquor if 
necessary. 

172.— FRUIT TARTLETS. 

All the fruit and cream fillings given in former 
recipes may be used for tart fillings; also the fruit 
jams and jellies. 

Take tart paste or puff paste; roll out in a sheet 
about one-eighth of an inch in thickness. 'With a 
scalloped cutter cut out rounds a little large* than 
the top of the tart tins; put in the greased tins; 
press it well on the-sides with a piece of stifi paste; 
put in the filling and bake. 

A quicker way to line the tart molds is to sot the 
greased tart forms on the table; roll out a sheet of 
the paste and lay it over the tins. With a round 
ball of paste press the other paste in the tins and 
cut off the surplus paste, pressing through with 
the hands. Set the forms on a pan, fill and bake. 
The fruit tarts may be decorated with meringue 
or whipped cream as fancy dictates.

192.— DARIOLES. 
MIRLITONS. 
FANCHONETTES. 

Are the French names for small cream and 
fruit tarts. 

The Darioles are similar to the Almontines, the 
only difference being that powdered macaroons 
are used in place of almonds. 

Mirlitons are made like a fruit custard pie — a 
little preserve in the bottom of the lined tins, 
filled up with custard and baked. 

Fanchonettes are pufi paste lined tarts filled 
with a rich almond pastry cream or custard, 
baked, cooled and decorated with a meringue or 
other icing, which may be made more elaborate 
by adding candied fruits. 

The fancy nut cream fillings, with and without 
chocolate, given in Nos. 111-117, make the best 
fillings for these tarts. 
FANCHONETTES A LA VANILLE.

FANCHONETTES AU CHOCOLAT. 

Fill with chocolate cream. 
FANCHONETTES AUX AMANDES.

pufi paste lined pans and bake. Sift some powd- 
ered sugar and cinnamon over the tarts when done. 

Some Sultana raisins and currants may bo 
added to this mixture. 

195.— CHEESE CUSTARD TARTS. 

Take eight ounces of dry grated cheese, mix 
with eight eggs, six ounces of sugar, the grated 
rind of one lemon. Beat in gradually one quart 
of milk, fill into the lined tart molds and bake. 
Dust with sugar and cinnamon when done. 
196.— ENGLISH CHEESE TARTS. 

Many of the English tart fillings are called 
cheese fillings, but are in fact custards mixed with 
cake crumbs and other ingredients, and nuts and 
flavors from which they take the name. 

No cheese is used in the tarts. 

In this manner a great variety of fruit, nut, 
chocolate, and other cream combinations are 
made to serve as tart fillings. 

From one standard filling, changing the flavors 
and other ingredients, a great many mixtures can 
be made. 

When the tarts are baked, they may be decor- 
ated in various ways. Use a pink water icing and 
sprinkle with cocoanut, decorate with royal icing, 
with a cornet and small star tube. 

Or dip the edge of the tarts in diluted jelly and 
sprinkle with cocoanut. 

Ice white and decorate with a star of angelica 
and candied cherries. 

Ice chocolate and decorate with white or pink 
design. 

The colored sugars may also be used for dec

the last thing. Line the tart forms with paste 
No. 84, fill in the mixture and bake in a medium 
beat. 

204.— LEMON TARTLETS. 

Rub eight ounces of almond paste with the 
juice and grated rind of two lemons and eight 
ounces of sugar. Make a custard of one quart of 
rich milk, twelve yolks and six ounces of sugar;

ICINGS. 

205.— FONDANT ICING. 

To make this icing requires a marble slab, same 
as used for candy making; also the regular iron 
candy bars and a long wooden spatula or paddle. 

Take five pounds of granulated sugar, eight 
ounces of glucose and one quart of water. (More 
or less glucose may be used, or it may be left out 
altogether, but confectioners generally use glu- 
cose for cream fondants). 

Boil the sugar to the soft ball degree. Wet the 
marble with a little water. Put on the iron bars 
in a square or oblong and ponr the boiling sugar 
on the slab. Sprinkle a little water on the top. 
Let the sugar become nearly cold; scrape o£E the 
bars and work it with the scraper loose from the 
bottom to the center; then work with the spatula 
back and forth till it gets white and creamy and 
begins to harden. Scrape all together, working

it with the hands in one piece. Put in a jar, 
cover with a wet cloth and put away for use. 

When wanted for use take what you require, 
put it in a saucepan, add what flavor and color 
you wish it to be, set this pan in another pan with 
hot water, or on a slow fire, and stir till it is all 
melted. Do not heat the icing more than blood 
warm, because too much heat makes the icing 
lose its creamy texture and it becomes hard and 
brittle — loses its gloss. 

When the icing is soft enough it should be used 
at once, because it sets and dries >quickly. 

The large cake^ are iced with the palette knife; 
the smaller drops and the cut-up blocks are dipped 
in the icing and set on wire grates to drain. 

Fondant is also used between the layers of 
cakes as a filling, because of its creamy consist- 
ency; and it is used in candy making to form the 
body of the chocolate and other cream candies, etc. 

206.— TRANSPARENT ICING. 
Boil two pounds of sugar to the blow degree. 
Take ofE the fire and rub a little of it against the 
side of the pan to grain. As soon as it gets white 
and creamy stir it into the other sugar; and use 
same as Fondant Icing No. 205 while hot. 

207.— IMITATION FONDANT ICING. 
WATER ICING. 

Take any quantity of icing sugar (XXXX powd- 
ered sugar)' and mix with hot water into a thin 
paste; color and flavor to suit. Have the icing 
not more than blood warm and use same as Fond- 
ant Icing No. 205. 

The same icing made with cold water and the 
proper flavor and color makes the plain water 
icing. 

The cold icing does not dry as readily as the 
hot icing, but is used like the others. 

208.— BOILED CHOCOLATE ICING. 
Dissolve six ounces of bitter chocolate (un- 
sweetened) with one pound of sugar and half a 
pint of water, let boil till it forms a thread be- 
tween the fingers. Take off the fire, stir till it 
forms a thin skin on top; stir till blood warm and 
use same as the Fondant Icing No. 203. Flavor 
vanilla. 

209.— CREAM CARAMEL ICING. 

One pound of granulated sugar, six ounces of 
butter, half pint of cream. 

Boil all the ingredients together to the soft ball. 
Take ofi the fire and add a little caramel color. 
Cool a little and use same as Fondant Icing No. 205. 

Chocolate may be added for Chocolate Cream 
Icing. Flavor vanilla. 

This icing may be used also between the layers 
for chocolate and caramel cream cake, and has 
the true caramel flavor. 



Other caramel icing may be made by adding 
caramel coloring to Fondant and other icings. 

210.— ROYAL ICING. 
The Royal icing is used for icing and also for 
ornamenting. It dries rapidly if exposed to the 
air and should be kept well covered with a damp 
cloth at all times, in a cool place. 

For ornamenting it is beaten with the whites of 
eggs till it retains its shape if drawn to a point. 
For icing it is only beaten to about the consist- 
ency of a cream, so it runs smooth. 

The sugar should be run through a very fine 
sieve before using, to prevent lumps clogging the 
cornet in decorating. 

Much acid makes a coarse icing, and very little 
should be used for piping; or none at all if a tough 
icing for fine thread lining is required. 

Make the icing pretty strong at the beginning 
and work up white and light; then add a little 
more of the whites till it is of the proper con- 
sistency. 

Take from three to four whites of eggs to one 
pound of XXXX powdered sugar, a small pinch 
of cream of tartar, or one drop of acetic acid; put 
in a china bowl and beat with one or two small 
spatulas, (one in each hand), and treat as directed 
above. 

211.— FRUIT ICING. 
Take clear fruit syrup and mix with XXXX 
powdered sugar to a smooth paste; add a little 
more color and use. 

212.— CHOCOLATE ICING. 
Mix some chocolate which has been melted 
with Fondant or Royal icing. Flavor vanilla. 

Another way is: Dissolve four ounces of un- 
sweetened chocolate with some hot water and add 
one pound of XXXX powdered sugar; mix well 
together warm; flavor vanilla and use. 

Whites of eggs may be added for gloss. Some 
use cocoa butter; and for cheap icings add lard to 
the warm icing. 

213— MARSHMALLOW ICING. 
Take one ounce of marshmallow iciline powder; 
or use half an ounce of powdered gelatine, half 
an ounce of powdered gum arabic, one pound of 
icing sugar and one pint of warm water. Beat 
up together in a pan of hot water. When light, 
take off and beat cold till it is firm. Flavor 
vanilla and orange. 

If the mixture is too firm more water may be 
added. 

This icing is used mostly for cake filling. In 
larger quantities it is beaten up by machine. 

Iciline powder for marshmallow icing and 
other icing powders are sold by all the confec- 
tioners' supply houses. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKBS, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



23 



214.— CHEAP GELATINE ICINGS. 

In place of whites of eggs, gelatine and albu- 
men is used for cheaper goods. Take two ounces 
of gelatine and let it soak in one quart of cold 
water for twenty minutes. Set on the fire and 
let come to a slow boil. Take off the scum which 
arises, and remove from the fire. Add a good pinch 
of powdered alum, mix it well and set away for use. 

To use it, take as much as wanted; mix with an 
even part of warm water and add XXXX powd- 
ered sugar, beat it up same as Royal Icing No. 
210; flavor and color to suit. 

215.— ALMOND PASTE ICING. 

Take one pound of almond paste and one pound 

of powdered sugar. Make it into a medium paste 

with about two whole eggs; or use yolks only. 

Flavor vanilla . Spread over the cake, top and 

sides, with a palette knife; or put the paste in 

the bag with the plain or star tube and decorate 

the cake with the icing in this manner: Put the 

cake on a board or double paper and put in the 

oven to color nicely. When done finish the cake 

with Fondant Icing No, 205 or Royal Icing N0.210. 

216.— CHOCOLATE CREAM ICING. 

VIENNA CREAM ICING. 

BUTTER ICING. 

This icing may be used for filling as well as for 
ornamenting. 



The best white fresh butter without salt should 
be used. It may be flavored with cordials or ex- 
tracts and colored any shade. 

For Chocolate cream Icing add powdered 
cocoa and flavor vanilla. Take one pound of 
white butter, one pound eight ounces of icing 
sugar. Rub to a cream with three whites of eggs, 
or four tablespoonfuls of whipped cream. Flavor 
maraschino or rum; color to suit. 

The Vienna Cream Fillings No. 122 and No. 123 
may be used for the same purpose. 

2i6^._USE OF COLORS IN ICING CAKES. 
The use of colors in icing cakes should be care- 
fully studied to produce the proper effects. Green 
colors should be used sparingly because many 
people object to green, except it is in the shape 
of pistachio nuts or angelica. Delicate colors 
are admissable in all decorations, while strong 
colors are offensive to good taste. Fondant and 
water icings may be used in connection with 
candied French fruit glaces for decoration; and 
clear fruit jellies of different colors make also 
very pleasing effects.

264.— WHITE FRUIT CAKES. 

Add to No. 240 three pounds of mixed fruit, 
consisting of two pounds of sultanas, a half pound 
of blanched and shredded almonds, a half pound 
of citron and orange peel; also add four ounces 
more flour. 

Mix and bake as usual. 

With other fruit the same mixture can be made 
into FIG, DATE, PLAIN RAISIN, or SUL- 
TANA CURRANT CAKES, etc. 
265— NUT CAKES. 

From the pound and white cake mixtures a 
variety of Nut Cakes may be made with the 
different kinds of nut meats. 

The best way to bake these cakes is to bake 
them in the small round, oval or square tins 
which hold from eight ounces to one pound. The 
Angel Cake molds may also be used to advantage. 

By using the different nuts you get 

WALNUT CAKE, 

PECAN CAKE, 

BRAZILIAN CAKE, 

PEANUT CAKE, 

FILBERT CAKE and 

PISTACHIO CAKE. 

Other combinations of this kind are made of 
mixed nuts and almonds; nuts and sultanas, 
nuts and orange peel, or nuts and French 
cherries, etc. 

Use either of the mixtures; flavor with lemon, 
orange or vanilla, or vanilla with a drop of bitter 
almond. 

Use about one ounce or more of the chopped 
nut meat to one pound of cake batter, and when 
the cakes are baked, ice fully and sprinkle with 
chopped nuts before the icing gets dry; or ice and 
sprinkle the sides with chopped nuts, and use 
some half walnuts or other kinds, or split almonds 
to decorate the top. 

For less expensive cake put only a broad strip 
of icing in the center and decorate with a few 
half nuts. 

Chocolate, caramel and vanilla, also nut-flavored 
icings are the most suitable for Nut Cake. 

With different shapes of tins, various icing and 
mixtures you can evolve many more cakes of this 
kind. 

A nice cake deserves a nice name and sells bet- 
ter, so you may call your cake Princess or Vic- 
toria or Duchess Nut Cake, etc. 



266 —MARBLE CAKES. 

Take white cake mixtures No. 242 or No. 243; 
color one-fourth part pink, and one-fourth part 
chocolate; put a thin layer of the white mixture 
on the bottom; put the other two colors in turns 
in the center; finish the top with a thin layer of 
white cake and bake. 

Ice with a soft water icing; color a little of the 
icing pink and chocolate, put each in a paper 
cornet and draw straight lines iu alternate colors 
across the soft white icing, then draw the knife 
in straight lines or in ziz-zag across the colored 
strips while the icing is soft. 

267.— DOMINO CAKES. 

Bake two sheets of cake of any suitable mix- 
ture and fill with jelly, jam or cream. Prepare 
two icings — a white and a chocolate. Ice one 
part white, one part chocolate. Cut the iced cake 
in long strips, about two inches wide, while the 
icing is soft. Draw a line along the center of 
each strip in reverse color, then cut the strip in 
one-inch slices and make the dots to imitate 
dominoes.

Serve plain, dusted with sugar, or decorate with 
meringue. 

Another variety of large Tourtes is made simi- 
lar to the Cream Pies given in former chapters. 
The bottoms are made from Pufi paste. Short 
paste, and from the Sponge and Genoise cake 
mixtures. From the puff pastes, the bottoms are 
baked as described in Nos. 131 and 132, and filled 
with the creams. Other bottoms are made from 
pastes N0S.82 to 84 with a raised edge of the same 
paste. The creams are filled in while warm, the 
same as for the Cream Pies. 

288.— TOURTE A LA CREME DE VANILLE.

and fill with the cream made as follows:

sugar, twelve yolks and four whole eggs, vanilla 
flavor.

cream come near the boiling point and stir it into 
the eggs; put back on the fire and stir till it 
thickens; take off at once, flavor and strain and

fill into the baked bottoms; let cool and serve. To 
this creme may be added chocolate, or the grated 
rind of oranges or lemons, nut or browned al- 
monds, and this would give your Creme au 
Cbocolat, Creme d'Oranges, Creme de Nois- 
ettes, etc. The same creme made from wine in- 
stead of cream, flavored with spice and lemon o.' 
orange rind makes another variety of Wine Cream 
Tourtes. 

Other tourtes of this class are made from fresh 
fruits, which should be very ripe, such as straw- 
berries, raspberries and ripe soft peaches. Pre- 
pare and bake the bottoms same as for the Creme 
Tourtes. 

Beat up firm one quart of double cream and 
put it on a sieve to drain. Sweeten two quarts 
of crushed fruit and stir it cold till it forms a rich 
jam. Mix in this two-thirds of the drained cream 
and fill into the baked bottom. Fill the rest of 
the whipped cream into a bag and decorate the 
tourte with it in lattice fashion. 

Some of these large Tart Cakes can be baked 
ia sheet form and cut in squares. They may also 
be baked in the smaller laydr cake tins, but should 
sell for abetter price to leave a reasonable profit

295.— HONEY CAKE. 

Take half New Orleans molasses and half honey 
and let it come to a boil; skim well, throw a little 
cold water in it, let it boil up and skim again, 
then take off the fire. Let ccol till you can hold 
your hand in it, then work in enough soft flour 
to make a medium dough. 

In Germany it is customary to make this dough 
several months before it is used, because it im- 
proves with age. 

Take from this stock dough, and into five 
pounds of it work one-half ounce of soda, or one- 
fourth ounce of ammonia dissolved in a little 
water, and a tablespoonful of mixed spice. Add 
one-half pound of chopped almonds, one half 
pound of citron and some lemon extract, and 
work it all well together. 

Before baking the whole batch it is best to 
make a test with one small cake, because the dif- 
ference in the acidity of the honey and molasses 
requires this test, to be certain in the result. 

If the cakes are too light, work more stock 
dough into it; if too heavy, add more soda or 
ammonia 

Make into single cakes; or, roll out a sheet as 
large as the pan, grease and dust the pan with 
flour, put on the dough about one-third inch thick 
and bake in a medium heat. 

Make a boiled icing like No. 206, very thin, 
grain it on the side of the pan till it gets white 
and brush the cake over with it. Let dry and 
cut the cake in small pieces. Other cakes are 
made smaller shapes in square and heart forms; 
also figures of men and animals are cut from 
the paste, decorated with icing of different colors. 

Other decorations are executed with blanched 
almonds and slices of citron, and the cakes are 
iced with a gloss of gum water while warm. 

The cheapest grades of these cakes are made 
from molasses and brown sugar in the same man- 
ner as given above.

white or pink. 

304— JELLY ROLL. 
The mixtures from Nos. 244 to 250 make the 
b3st Jelly Roll mixtures, if baked in sheets on 
paper and rolled warm. I give here a couple of 
commercial receipts, less expensive and quickly 
made: 

JELLY ROLL No. i. 

I lb. of sugar i lb. of flour 12 eggs 

I oz. baking powder vanilla flavor 

JELLY ROLL No. 2, 

I lb. of sugar i}4 lb. flour i oz. baking powder 

5 eggs a pint milk 

Sift the baking powder in the flour; beat the 
sugar and eggs together, and add the flavor and 
flour. 

For the second mixture, add the flour, and mix 
the milk afterwards. 

Spread the mixture with the palette knife on the 
paper very thin, and bake in 400 to 450 degrees 
Fahrenheit. When done, turn at once over on a 
paper dusted with sugar; the paper side up. Wet 
the paper, remove it quickly and spread the cake 
over with a soft preserve or jelly, and roll up. 
Roll it up tight, so it keeps its shape in the paper. 

A better mixture is made with sixteen eags to 
the pound of flour and sugar; beaten up like No. 
244, warm and cold, and made and rolled as de- 
scribed above, 

Lately the large bakeries and caterers are mak- 
ing a variety of fancy rolls in this manner. In 
place of using a plain jelly or jam, the cream 
fillings and cream icings are used, and the rolls 
are iced with almond and cream icings and rolled 
in chopped nuts, which makes a very rich looking 
roll. If the creams are used as given in the chapter 
of Fillings, you can make Vanilla Cream Roll, 
Chocolate Cream Roll, Nut Cream Roll, etc. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



37 



Fill the roll with the creams, and ice when cold 
with chocolate, vanilla, or caramel icing; or 
spread with a light jam or jelly, and roll in cocoa- 
nut; or fill with nut or almond cream, or icing; 
spread the outside with a thin almond icing and 
roll in chopped nuts. 

Use Cream No. 157 for the Floradora Cream 
Roll. 

Another variety of these rolls are made with 
two colors; one part of the mixture is colored 
pink or chocolate. Two thin sheets are put to- 
gether with jelly; another coat of jelly or cream 
is spread on the top, and both sheets are rolled 
up together. 

Another way is to roll one small roll of one 
color inside of another roll; the outside can be 
masked with jam, or iced with fondant or other 
icing, and decorated with fancy piping and with 
French fruits. 

These fancy rolls are sold as Swiss Roll, Paris 
Roll. Princess Roll, etc. 

305— PUNCH CAKE. 

Take some left-over sponge, pound or white 
cakes, and cut up in half-inch dice. Make a thin 
syrup with one pint of water and one pound of 
granulated sugar, add the juice and grated rind of 
one orange or lemon and a glass of good rum. 
Moisten the cake with this syrup and mix to- 
gether. 

Line a square pan with a thin sheet of (sponge 
cake on bottom and sides; spread with jam or 
jelly and put in the moistened cake. Take another 
thin sheet of sponge cake, spread with jelly, and 
put with the jelly inside on top of the moistened 
cake. Press well together, put another heavy 
pan on top, with a weight to press down, and let 
stand for some time to make it firm; then turn 
the pan upside down on a board and ice with a 
punch icing, flavored rum and lemon. 

306— HARLEQUIN CAKE. 

This cake is made in the same manner as the 
Punch Cake, using cakes of different colors, pink, 
white, dark and yellow, cut in dice and mixed 
with a fruit syrup, or with diluted jelly, and fill 
into a pan lined same as for Punch Cake. Ice in 
different colors same as in No. 266. These cakes 
are very useful to dispose of left-over cakes. 

Another cake of this kind can be made, using 
crumbs. Mix with a few chopped nuts and 
raisins, add a good flavor of spices, and moisten 
with syrup or wine sauce, and finish same way as 
for Punch or Harlequin Cake. 

307— NEAPOLITAN CAKE. 
For this cake you require four different kinds 
of cake. A solid Pound and Lady Cake mixture 



are the best. Color one part chocolate, one part 
pink, leave one part white and one part yellow. 
Cut the cake in one-inch square strips, and jam 
the pieces together, placing a thin two-inch strip 
of sponge cake on the bottom and top. Mask the 
square with Almond Icing No. 216, and put in the 
oven to color lightly. Let cool and ice in three 
colors with fondant or water icing. 
308— DEVIL'S CAKE. 
Bake three layers from mixture No. 279, or 
from plain Chocolate or Spice Cake mixtures. 
Spread with chocolate filling, and ice with a very 
dark chocolate icing.

Make the mixture No. 102 or 103. Lay out 
with bag and plain tube in the size of large drops 
on greased and dusted pans; brush over with eggs 
and bake in 400 degrees Fahrenheit. When done 
cat on the sides and fill with pastry cream. 

The puffs may also be filled with whipped cream, 
sweetened and flavored. Cut out a round piece 
from the top and fill with cream. Dress the 
Eclairs on the pans in finger shape; let stand for 
a while before baking, and bake in a slower heat 
than the puffs; fill with cream and ice with choco- 
late, vanilla, etc , etc. 

310— LADYFINGERS. 
SAVOY BISCUIT. 
BISCUIT CUILLIERE. 
Prepare mixture No. 250 or 249, and with bag 
and tube lay out fingers on paper. Sift over with 
powdered sugar. Shake off the surplus sugar; 
put the paper on pans and bake in 400 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Let ccol and take off the fingers, 
wetting the paper on the underside, and stick two 
together. 

311— SMALL FANCY CAKES FROM SPONGE 
MIXTURES. 
A variety of small cakes can be made from the 
sponge mixtures; making plain drops and sprinkle 
with nuts and almonds. Spread the bottom with 
jelly when baked and stick two together; or, make 
drops in bean shape, put two together v/ith almond 
paste and ice with chocolate, white, yellow, pink 
or light green. Other drops are scooped out and 
filled with cream or jam, iced and decorated like 
the other small cakes, as I have suggested in No. 
275.

pastry cream; put two together and dip in choco- 
late. 

313— DESDEMONAS. 

Fill like the Otbellos; ice with white fondant 
or royal icing; put on pink cheeks, with carmine, 
and serve one Othello and one Desdemona to- 
gether on one plate, to represent the two star 
actors in Shakespeare's drama. 

314— AFRICANS. 
Make like the Othello's; scoop out, dip each 
half in chocolate, let dry and put two together 
filled with whipped cream.

lemon or vanilla flavor. 
Mix same as No. 336. 



339— ALMOND JUMBLES. 

I lb. sugar, % lb. butter, % lb. almond paste, 

I pinch ammonia, 8 eggs, 2 lbs, flour, 

vanilla flavor. 

Rub the almond paste smooth with one egg, and 

mix same as the other Jumbles. 

340— VANILLA WAFERS. 
I lb. 2 oz. butter, 8 eggs, i lb. flour, vanilla flavor 

I lb. XXXX powdered sugar. 
Make and dress same as Jumbles. Bake on very 
straight smooth pans lightly greased, and take oS 
the pans while warm. 

341— ROLLED WAFERS. 

ICE CREAM WAFERS. 
}i lb. sugar ^ lb. flour 12 whites of eggs 
vanilla flavor, a little cream or milk. 
Beat the whites firm, add the sugar and flavor 
and mix well, then add the flour and some milk to 
make a soft batter. This mixture can be flavored 
rose and colored pink; or cinnamon added to the 
vanilla, etc. 

Take smooth pans, well cleaned, and make hot 
in the oven; rub over with white wax and let cool. 
(Drained butter may be used also, but it is pre- 
ferable to use wax.) Lay out the wafers and 
spread with the back of a. spoon in round or oval 
shape, or about three inches in diameter; then 
put one pan at a time in a good oven of about 400 
degrees Fahrenheit, and let color nicely. Draw 
the pan to the front of the oven, where you can 
reach the wafers, and with the palette knife take 
them up, one after the other, and roll on a stick. 
This has to be done as quick as possible, or the 
wafers will become too crisp and break in rolling. 
To make Cornets, the wafers are rolled on a 
pointed stick. Another way to dress the wafers 
on the pans, is to use a piece of cardboard cut 
like a stencil in the shape of a water. The sten- 
cil is put on the pan, then put a little of the pre- 
pared paste in the hole and smooth it with the 
palette knife to an even thickhess; this gives a 
uniform size to the wafer. 

By means of the stencil the wafers are made 
for cases, cornucopias and leaves, which are used 
for decorating show pieces. 

Wafers will keep for a long time in dry air-tight 
boxes, and can be made in all flavors.

should have a strong vanilla flavor. 



Have ready prepared pans greased with melted 
lard, dusted with flour and the surplus shaken oS. 
Dress on the pans in large finger shape (larger 
than lady-fingers). When all the fingers are 
dressed on the pans, dredge them lightly with 
powdered sugar and let them stand for ten to 
fifteen minutes; then turn over to shake off the 
surplus sugar. Bake same as lady-fingers in about 
400 degrees Fahrenheit. 

The biscuit may also be baked on paper; but 
after baking should not be turned over and wetted, 
as this would break the little pearls of sugar which 
form during baking. It is best to remove them 
with a palette knife while warm.

of egg to make a firm paste. Roll out very thin 
on the marble, use a little powdered sugar for 
dusting (no flour); cut out iu stars, rings, hearts 
and basket-shapes. (It is best to use a cutter with 
a center tube, or cut a hole in the center of the 
cake with a small cutter: this makes the cake pufi 
up better and more even.) Set the cake on lightly 
greased and dusted pans, let dry a little to form a 
thin crust, and bake in a cool oven. 

This cake, if properly made, rises up like pufl 
paste. When done and cool, ice with a thin royal 
icing and decorate in different colors.

out on waxed pans in form of pigeons or roosters, 
starting on the tail; form the body, and last draw 
up the head; then put on the wings, feet and eyes. 
Swans and large birds are made on one side only, 
to lay flat on the pan; others can be made to sit 
up straight. 

For other animals, such as dogs, sheep, etc., a 
flat bottom is made from white meringue, sprinkled 
with green colored sugar. Then, with a small 
plain tube, the animal figure is put on; starting at 
the back part of a body in S shape; next make the 
head; then put on the ears, legs, tail and eyes.

on the boards, a little apart. Put in the center of '° be perfect. 



half of the drops a small strip of angelica, to 
represent the stem of the apple; and in the center 
of the other drops a whole clove, from which the 
berry has been taken, to form the top. Sprinkle 
with a little colored sugar, and put the boards in 
the oven to dry. The meringues should more dry 
than bake. When sufficiently dry, put two of the 
drops together; this forms the apple. Put away 
carefully, and let dry a little more before serving. 

For PEARS, dress the meringues on in half a 
pear shape, lengthwise, and put together in this 
manner. . ,, 

The PEARS may also be dressed da the pans in 
one piece, and finished with angelica and cloves, 

377.— MUSHROOMS. 
Put some of the white Meringue paste in bag, 
and use a plain tube. Put drops on the papered 
boards, same as for apples. Smooth the top with 
a wet finger tip so as to form a half globule. 
Dust the tops with cocoa powder or cinnamon, 
and put in the oven to dry. Take a dusted pan 
and put on as many steeples as you have tops. 
Put the steeples in the oven to dry. When the 
tops are sufficiently dry, lift them off the board 
and place one on each steeple. Let dry a little 
more; this forms the mushioom. 

378.— STRAWBERRIES. 
GRAPES. 
CHERRIES. 
Dress pink paste on the boards to form half a 
strawberry. Sprinkle thickly with carmine 
colored sugar. Place the stem in one half, let dry 
and put together; let dry a little more; put on some 
leaves that have been made with green colored 
paste, and you have the Strawberry. 

GRAPES may be made on dusted pans in the 
the same manner.

small spoon; let dry a little more and decorate in 
the same manner as Sponge Eggs No. 316. 

381.— MERINGUE BASKETS. 
Lay out in high ovals, as instructed in No. 317, 
and decorate the same as sponge baskets. The 
baskets can also be made in round shapes, with a 
foot of royal icing, and the sides decorated in 
lattice fashion. 

382. — LARGE MERINGUE CASES FOR 
TOURTES AND ICE CREAMS. 
ALSO SMALL MERINGUE CASES, ETC. 

From the pastes Nos. 94 to 96. 

Dress on a straight waxed baking sheet with the 
lady-finger tubfe, one round sheet of the size you 
wish it to be. Dress two rings of the same dia- 
meter. For the top make another ring, and fill 
out the center in lattice fashion, or in a fancy pat- 
tern. Let dry well to a light color, very crisp. 
For use, fasten the rings on top of each other on 
the bottom, with marmalade or royal icing. Fill 
the center with cream, or with strawberries and 
whipped cream; or with ice cream, as the case 
may be, and put on the top. It may be further 
decorated with fruits glaces or royal icing. 

Small Tart cases may be made in the same 
manner. 

Large pieces in form of beehives, baskets, wells, 
etc., are put together in the same manner, deco- 
rated with leaves and flowers. 

Another variety of small Meringues can ba 
made with plain and star tube on pans and boards. 
Round and oval shells may be dressed on boards 
like for Easter Eggs No. 380. The soft inside 
taken out and the shells dried, when they may be 
iced with chocolate or fondant icing of difierent

colors and flavors, filled with nut creams, jams or 
whipped cream; two shells put together and 
served in this manner. 

383.— MERINGUE SLICES. 
Take a thin sheet of baked sponge cake; spread 
with fruit jam, and cut in strips two inches wide. 
Lay on top of the jam, with bag and tube, four 
strips of meringue, to cover the jam. On top of 
this put three strips; then two; then one, in taper- 
ing fashion. Dust with sugar and color nicely in 
the oven. When done, cut with a knife, dipped 
in water, into slices. 

Another way is to cut the strips with the mer- 
ingue before baking. Dip the knife in hot water 
and cut down, and bring the knife up straight, to 
smooth the sides, pushing the pieces apart, and 
dust with sugar; then brown lightly in the oven. 
Another way is to make the slices, spread on the 
meringue and smooth it half round; dust with 
sugar; brown and then ice with hot chocolate 
icing, and cut in slices.

a baking pan; spread with a thick layer of jam; 
wash the edges of the sheet and place another 
thin sheet of the same paste on top, pressing it 
well together on the sides. Mark the top into 
oblong slices; wash over and bake. When nearly 
done, dust some sugar over; put back in the oven 
till the sugar is melted to form a glazing. Let 
cool and cut in slices. 

388.— RISSOLES. 
Roll out pufi paste into a thin sheet; cut out

oven door and dust with sugar; put back in the 
oven to glaze and finish baking. The paste should 
pufi np like a rose. Fill with a little jelly, and 
decorate with royal icing. 

395.— PARISIENNES. 
Take pufi paste which has got only four turns; 
finish the other turns, dusting each tarn, and fold 
with powdered sugar. Roll out very thin and cut 
in pieces, say six to twelve inches. Roll this sheet 
up in one roll same as for jelly roll; or roll from 
each side to the center; or roll in form of a S, as 
tight as possible. Cut in thin slices with a sharp 
knife; put on pans cut side up, and bake in a 
quick heat. When they take color, turn over on

the Other side and finish baking. The sugar 
should glaze nicely and form a caramel. Take off 
the pans while hot. 

396,— BASKETS. 

Cut out ovals from pufi paste -with a crimped 
cutter; mark the top same as for Patties, but in 
two parts, leaving the center to form the handle. 
Wash with eggs and bake. Push the sides down, 
or remove the soft inside paste; fill with jelly or 
whipped cream. 

The handle may be baked separate on a half 
round tin, and placed over the cream, or fastened 
with royal icing. 

397.— BIRDS" NESTS, 
Bake small patty cases from puS paste. When 
done, brush with a thin royal icing and scatter 
over plenty of shredded cocoanut. Put back in 
the oven for a moment to color lightly; fill the 
center with jelly or jam, and place three or four 
small blanched almonds on the jelly to represent 
the eggs; or use some small candy eggs.

Large pieces from puff paste are built up in 
rings (which are baked separate and put together 
with jam or caramel sugar, or a couple of patty 
cases, diminishing in diameter) are placed on 
top of each other to form a pyramid. 

Another way is to bake a skeleton frame of the 
croquant paste No. 89, and place the puff paste 
rings (after they are baked) over the frame, fasten- 
ing with caramel or royal icing. 

The forms may be decorated with meringue or 
almond icing, and browned lightly in the oven 
before filling; or it may be decorated with fancy 
macaroons or other small cakes, etc.

From the Milanaise paste No. 319 another 
variety can be made; using one layer of puff paste 
and one layer of Milanaise; or bake strips of 
Milanaise, put together with jam, ice and sprinkle 
with nuts or almcnds while warm, and cut in 
slices before the baked paste gets too crisp.

-ORNAMENTING LARGE CAKES. 



The suggestions I have given about ornament- 
ing the small cakes, can be applied in a more 
elaborate way for the larger cakes. 

The ROYAL ICING may be colored in delicate 
shades, or left plain; the FONDANT and WATER 
ICINGS may be used in the same manner, 

The CHOCOLATE and CARAMEL ICINGS 
are also effective for decorating, if trimmed in 
pink or white colors. 

The cake to be iced should be trimmed straight 
and the icing put on in one or two coatings, and 
let dry before decorating. 

I think a fine line ornamenting the most artistic, 
but it requires considerable skill and long practice, 
aiso a steady hand. 

In decorating, it is best to find the exact center 
of the cake; mark the outer edge in even divisions, 
and put on the design. 

A plainer and more practical way, and most 
effective, for the less experienced, is to use 
stamps, designs of scrolls and figures, which can 
be made, or bought in supply houses, Mark out 
the top of the cake with a square or star pattern 
in divisions, mark the divisions with the scroll or 
stamp, and then trace the lines with bag and tube. 
The Royal Icing should be light but tough, for 
line-ornamenting, with very little acid; or better, 
without any, because acid makes the icing porous 
and the lines break easily. To increase the 
effect, silver and gold dragees, leaves and flowers, 
made from icing and gum pastes, may be used. 

For cakes iced with Fondant and Water Icing 
the French fruits glaces may be used for leaf and 
flower effects; also for small baskets and cornu- 
copias, interspersed with a line decoration of 
Ro>al Icing. 

The different colored fruit jellies may be ap- 
plied, pressed through a cloth and filled in a paper 
cornet, between the other decorations, which is 
also very effective and rich looking. 

Other large ornaments for cake tops are made 
from firm macaroon paste in form of rings and 
scrolls, baked and put together with caramel sugar 
or Royal Icing, decorated with piping and with 
candied fruit, etc.

414.— THE USE OF CAKE CRUMBS AND 
LEFT-OVER CAKES. 
I have given a variety of recipes in which cake 
crumbs are mentioned, and also others where the 
left-over cake can be used in pieces. These 
recipes are useful to dispose of cake trimmings 
and broken or stale cakes. Even bread crumbs 
may be used to some extent, but in these cakes the 
mixtures should be made richer. Crumbs are also 
mentioned in some fillings, where they take the 
place of eggs. If there is still a surplus of 



crumbs, they may be used with half the flour in 
spiced muffins, ginger bread, or in Boston brown 
bread. 

In the following pudding receipts, cakes and 
crumbs are required in many ways, and there is 
use for all of them, so that there is no need of 
any of them going to waste. 

It is best to keep the light and dark crumbs 
and cakes apart, so they can be used as required. 

Rich crumbs readily become rancid and should 
be used as fresh as possible. 



END OF PART THREE. 
(other RECEIPES to follow in the BREAD MAKING.) 



PART 4. 



415.-PUDDINGS AND SAUCES. 

As in cake baking, the ingredients used in the 
pudding receipes should be carefully studied and 
everything should be got ready before mixing. 

The baking or boiling of the puddings to the 
right point is essential to obtain good results. 
Some of the ingredients, as rice, farina, tapioca and 
sago, take up a large amount of milk or water in 
boiling or baking. If the boiling is continued too 
long, the liquid evaporates, making the pudding 
dry. The same materials differ often greatly in 
their liquid absorbing qualities, therefore good 
judgment has to be used, adding more or less 
liquid to make the pudding perfect. 

After the mixtures have been prepared, before 
baking, they should be tasted carefully, to ascer- 
tain if they contain the proper flavor and season- 
ing. 

In baking light puddings which contain custard, 
the pudding should bake only until the eggs are 
set; more baking makes the puddings pufi up 
high, the eggs separate from the milk, which 
curdles, and when taken from the oven the pud- 
ding falls and gets watery. 

Puddings that are served in the dishes in which 
they are baked require less eggs, and can be 
made more tender than the puddings which have 
to be turned from the molds before serving. 

Puddings which are turned from the molds are 
best if baked in a pan partly fllled with hot water; 
and for hot puddings, the molds should be but- 
tered and sprinkled with granulated sugar before 
filling in the mixture. In this manner they are 
easily turned out of the mold. 

Most all the hotels have steamers, in which rice, 
sago and tapioca can be steamed to best advantage 
without stirring, and then finished with the other 
ingredients and made ready for the baking. 

STEAMER FOR PASTRY ROOM: The best, 
cheapest and most practical steamer for the pastry 
room, is a closet, made from galvanized sheet iron, 
about 16 inches square, and from 18 to 24 inches 
high, with changeable perforated shelves of the 
same material, a perforated steampipe run in 
along the bottom in the rear; and a small trough 
at the bottom in front of the door, which catches 
the condensed water, to run from there into a pail 
or drain. In these steamers, steamed rolls and 
dumplings can be set right on the shelves and 
steamed without molds. And for other steamed 
puddings and Boston brown bread they are far 
more practical and make better puddings, than 
the deep cast iron vegetable steamers often found 
in the pastry rooms. 



If the pudding is to be boiled, it is best to sus- 
pend it in the boihng water, so it does not touch 
the botton of the pot; or a perforated pie tin may 
be placed in the bottom to prevent this. During 
boiling, the pudding should be covered by the 
water, and the pot filled with more boiling water 
as it boils down, till the pudding is done.

process; to be served with ice creams or frozen 
puddings. 

442.— COLD CREAM SAUCE. 

I pint rich milk, i pint double cream, 8 ozs. sugar, 
% oz. gelatin.

firm; sweeten with four ounces of powdered 
sugar and flavor vanilla. 

For MOUSSELINE flavor with the suitable 
cordials, as maraschino, noyeau, etc. 

446.— WHIPPED CREAM SAUCE FOR 
DECORATING. 

To obtain a firm cream which can be used for 
ornamenting cold puddings with bag and tube, use 
double cream that is a day old (new cream does 
not beat up well). Prepare the cream some time 
before it is wanted; put it in a basin and beat on 
ice, or in a cold place, with slow and even motion, 
till the beater stands in the cream, or till it can 
be drawn to a point. 

Fast beating breaks the cream, makes it curdle 
and get weak; a pinch of salt added assists in 
giving better consistency to the cream. 

After the cream is beaten up fim, put it on a 
sieve to drain for thirty minutes. 

To use it, beat into one quart of cream from 
four to sis ounces of fine powdered sugar, add 
flavor, and use with bag and tube. The puddings 
may be decorated in reverse colors, using pink and 
white cream. 

447.— HARD SAUCE. 

I lb, powdered sugar. 8 ozs. batter, a little mace, 

the grated rind and juice of half a lemon; 

flavor of rum, brandy or vanilla. 

Cream the butter and sugar till .igbt and white, 
add the flavor. Fill the cream into the bag, and 
with the star tube lay out in little pyramids, in 
portion forms, on cold pie tins Grate over a 
little nutmeg and put on ice to harden. 
' Whipped cream or the beaten whites of eggs 
may be added during the creaming, to make a 
lighter sauce. The cream fillings Nos. 12s and 
123 may also be used for HARD SAUCE.

with rum. 

570.— TIMBALE, MADISON. 

Prepare the savarin or. baba mixture; bake in 
high timbale molds, dip in sherry wine sauce, and 
serve with sauce macedoine. 

Another way to serve it, is to bake a light

cakes as you require puddings, in the timbale 
forms. Let cool; or, better, bake the day before 
using. Cut each of the cakes into eight slices. 
Leave top and bottom slice whole, and cut the 
other slices into rings. Spread the bottom slice 
with fruit jam; then place the rings one above the 
other, fastening them together with jam. Fill the

serve. 

576.— YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

This pudding does not properly belong to the 
class of sweet puddings served with the pastry. 
It is a batter pudding without sweetening, served 
generally with roast beef. The batter padding 
No. 453, without sugar, baked in a buttered 
square pan, makes an excellent pudding for this 
purpose, and some chefs use plain mixture as 
given here: 

Three-quarters of a pound of flour, one quart 
of milk, ten eggs, three ounces of melted butter, 
a little salt, grated nutmeg. 

Separate the eggs, and warm the milk lightly. 
Have the flour well sifted. Add about half of the 
milk to the flour and beat smooth, then add the 
yolks, butter and nutmeg, and gradually the rest 
of the milk; then add the beaten whites, and mix 
thoroughly. Bake in a quick oven to a nice brown. 



577- COLD PUDDINGS AND SIDE DISHES. 

A large variety of paddings are classed under 
this heading; and for restaurant service these 
cold dishes are very useful, because they may be 
kept on hand and in good condition for some time; 
while the hot puddings lose much in quality stand- 
ing after they are ready. 

It is necessary to have the proper forms for the 
difierent puddings to be served in an attractive 
manner. 

The high dome-shaped molds and ring mold are 
the most useful for cold puddings; also the timbale 
molds, which are best for custards. 

For the frozen and other large iced puddings 
melon and timbale molds should have tight fitting 
covers, and the ice cream brick molds can be used 
for some of the frozen puddings. 

Many of the frozen puddings are ice creams in 



reason I have placed some of them in the part of 
Frozen Creams. 

578.— COLD CABINET PUDDING. 
3 pints of rich milk, 12 yolks, 8 ozs. sugar, 
2 ozs. gelatin, 8 ozs. sultanas, 6 ozs. currants, 

2 ozs. cherries, 2 ozs. pineapple, a little mace, 

the grated rind of one lemon. 

Cut the candied fruit in dice, and with the 
rai.sins and currants, let simmer in a pint of light 
syrup or wine sauce till all the liquid is taken up 
by the fruit, then let cool. Soak the gelatin in a 
little cold water. When soft strain ofi the water 
and put the gelatin aside. 

Prepare the cake same way as for Baked Cabi- 
net Pudding No. 484, and moisten with a little 
sherry wine or syrup. Fill into the molds (which 
require no butter for this pudding) in layers with 
the soaked fruit. Let the milk and sugar come 
near to the boiling point; stir in the yolks; take 
o& when it begins to thicken; add flavor and 
gelatin, and strain. Pour the custard over the 
cake in the molds, let soak in thoroughly, and set 
in the ice box till the gelatin is well set. Un- 
mold the puddings by dipping in hot water for a 
moment; turn out on dish. Serve with whipped 
cream, or with a cold fruit sauce. 

579.— CHOCOLATE FARINA PUDDING. 

3 pints of milk, i pint of whipped cream, i lb. sugar- 

4 ozs. chocolate, 6 ozs. farina, i^ oz. gelatin, 

vanilla flavor. 

Soak the gelatin in a little cold water. Set milk 
and sugar to boil. Sprinkle in the farina, and let 
boil to a creamy consistency. Take ofi the fire, 
add the chocolate; stir until well dissolved, then 
add the gelatin and flavor. Stir on ice till it 
begins to set, draw in lightly the whipped cream, 
dip the pudding molds in water, dust with sugar, 
fill in with the mixture and set in the ice box. 
When cold and firm turn from the molds, and 
serve with a cold cream sauce. 

The same pudding may be made with the yolks 
of eight to ten eggs, a custard of a quart of milk, 
to which is added two ounces of gelatin (without 
the chocolate), into a plain Farina Custard, and 
served with cream, or a cold fruit sauce. 

580.— COLD CORNSTARCH PUDDING. 

2 quarts of milk, 5 ozs. cornstarch, 8 ozs. sugar, 
8 eggs, vanilla flavor. 
Prepare the same way as for No. 488, except 
stir the yolks with the cornstarch; let thicken and 
add the beaten whites and flavor. Fill at once 
into slightly wetted cups. Let cool, and serve 
with fruit or cream sauce.

ding is to be served in; put on the ice cream. 
Put the meringue in the dressing bag; use plain 
or star tube, and cover the cream in pyramid 
fashion. Decorate with French fruit; dust with 
powdered sugar. Set the dish in another platter 
in a very hot oven or range, to brown lightly, and 
serve at once. 



598.-LARGE AND SMALL CHARLOTTES. 

The Charlottes are made in various ways, with 
fillings of fruit and creams. 

The large Charlottes are the most attractive, 
because they admit of more decoration. 

The casing may be built around the creams 
after it is turned from the mold. It may be 



formed of iced strips of cake, fancy macaroons, 
meringues, and of fancy rolled wafers, placed 
around the base of the creams, and further 
decorated with whipped cream. 

Another way is to build the case from lady- 
fingers, macaroons, or meringues, around the out- 
side of the Charlotte mold, fastening the pieces 
together with sugar boiled to the caramel degree, 
or with royal icing. Let it dry well, and set the 
prepared case over the cream after it is turned 
from the mold. 

For the small Charlottes, the cases may be 
lined with the special crusts given in Nos. 97 and 
98. Ladyfingers and rolled wafers are also used 
for the lining. 

The commercial way is to serve the Charlottes 
in the paper cases, which are lined with sponge 
cake or ladyfingers, cut to fit; and some caterers 
serve large Charlottes in one- and two-quart glass 
bowls, lined with ladyfingers, filled with simple 
whipped cream, sweetened and flavored. The 
small ones in sherbet or wine glasses lined with 
ladyfingers or wafers, the centre decorated with 
cherries and angelica. 

The CHARLOTTE RUSSE and other cream 
mixtures in the following chapters are for creams 
which are to be turned from the molds. The 
amount of gelatin given is sufficient for this pur- 
pose. For Charlottes served in the case, less 
gelatin may be used; and in the small Charlottes, 
if they do not have to stand very long before 
serving, it may be left out altogether. 

The gelatins vary in strength, and the cheaper 
grades possess a strong flavor of glue, which often 
mars the delicate flavor of the creams, if too 
much is used. 

The most difficult and delicate part in preparing 
creams, to make them perfect, is the bringing to- 
gether at the right moment the part which con- 
tains the gelatin and the whipped cream. If the 
part which contains the gelatin is added too soon, 
before it begins to set, it injures the lightness of 
the whipped cream, and the preparation loses 
much of its beauty. If it sets too much, the 
gelatin part forms lumps, which cannot be prop- 
erly amalgamated with the lighter whipped cream. 

As soon as the mixture is prepared, it should be 
filled into the forms while it is still in a flowing 
condition, before the gelatin is firmly set. This 
;point must he observed in all the creams in which 
gelatin is used, because it is essential to make 
them perfect. 

599.— CHARLOTTE RUSSE MIXTURE NO. 1. 
I quart plain cream, i quart double cream, 

12 ozs. sugar, 2 ozs. gelatin,

to settle, and prepare the next color. Fill in the 
second layer. Set on ice again, and finish with 
the third color. 

The small individual Charlottes may be made 
in three layers; the larger ones in six and nine 
layers, in alternating colors. 

To serve: turn out of the form, decorate the 
aides with small ladyfingers, iced chocolate, pink 
and white, and fasten with a firm jam around the 
cream, a little apart. With bag and tube dress a 
border of whipped cream around the base, which

To serve: unmold, set on flat dishes, and place 
the fingers alternately around the cream, fasten- 
ing with strips of whipped cream on the sides, 
and a heavy border around the base. 

To make the Charlotte more elaborate, the 
fingers may be decorated with royal icing; and 
for a large Charlotte of this kind, the case may 
be prepared as indicated in No. 598. 

607.— STRAWBERRY CHARLOTTE. 

RASPBERRY CHARLOTTE. 

PEACH CHARLOTTE. 

APRICOT CHARLOTTE. 

NUT MEAT CHARLOTTE.

A plainer Charlotte of this kind can be made 
by adding ripe berries to the Charlotte Russe 
mixtures Nos. i, 2, or 3 (the strawberries cut in 
halves or quarters; the raspberries left whole), 
and filled into the molds as usual. Or, if served 
in the cases, some sweetened berries may be 
placed in the bottom, and the case filled with the 
mixture No. 4, which contains no gelatin. 

Ripe fresh peaches or apricots, cut in small dice 
and sweetened, may be substituted for berries, 
naming them PEACH or APRICOT CHAR- 
LOTTE. 

Other combinations may be made by adding 
crushed macaroons, browned almonds, or other 
nut meats, to peaches and apricots; or by using 
other preserved fruits or French fruits glaces, 
giving the Charlotte the appropriate names. 
608.— FROZEN CHARLOTTE RUSSE. 

Line the Charlotte mold same as for No. 604, 
and fill with the whipped cream No. 602. Set 
the Charlottes in the ice cave or freezing box for 
two hours. 

To serve : turn from the molds, ice with Fond- 
ant icing, and decorate with cherries and angelica, 
or with a bright red jelly. 

Another way is to decorate with whipped cream 
in two colors, pink and white, like No. 604. 

609.— CHARLOTTE WITH MACAROONS. 
CHARLOTTE WITH ALMONDS. 
CHARLOTTE WITH NUTS. 
CHARLOTTE WITH MERINGUES. 
PONCE DE LEON CHARLOTTES. 
Prepare the mixture No. 600. Add two ounces 
of crushed macaroons, flavor vanilla, fill into 
forms, and set on ice. 

Prepare small macaroons, decorate each with 
royal icing. Unmold the cream, place a border 
of whipped cream around; set the macaroons 
around the Charlotte and one on top of the 
cream, and finish the decoration with more whip- 
ped cream in fancy design. 

.Charlottes with almonds, nuts, and meringues 
may be made in the same manner, using small 
macaroons, wafers or meringues for side decora- 
tion. 

610.— CHARLOTTE GLACE. 
Line a dome-shaped meld with a pink colored 
jelly, as indicated in No. 596. Flavor the jelly 
maraschino or port wine. After the lining is 
firmly set, fill with mixture No. 599 or 601, and 
set on ice till the cream becomes firm. 

To serve: dip the mold in warm water for a 
moment, and turn carefully on a shallow dish. De- 
corate with whipped cream and small macaroons. 
611.— CHARLOTTE BELLEVUE. 
Line the molds with a clear wine jelly. Deco- 
rate the bottom with a star or any other fancy 



design of angelica and cherries. Fasten the fruit 
to the sides by dipping in some jelly. When the 
lining is set, fill the centre with a pink colored 
Charlotte Russe or Bavarian Cream, flavored 
strawberry or maraschino. Set on ice till firm; 
unmold, and serve in the same manner as Char- 
lotte Glace No. 610. 

Another way of making this Charlotte, is to fill 
some clear wine jelly into the bottom of the mold, 
decorate with fruit; put in a cake lining, as 
described in No. 604; fill with the Charlotte mix 
ture; let set, and serve with the jelly part on 
top and the sides decorated with whipped cream. 

612.— BAVARIAN CREAM. 
CREMES BAVAROIS. 
VANILLA BAVARIAN CREAM. 
CHOCOLATE BAVARIAN CREAM. 
I pint of plain cream, i pint of double cream, 
10 yolks, 8 ozs. of sugar, x)^ ozs. of gelatin, 
vanilla flavor. 

Soak the gelatin in a little cold water. Beat 
the double cream firm and let drain on a sieve. 
Put the sugar, yolks and plain cream on the fire; 
stir till it thickens, but do not let boil. Take ofi; 
stir in the gelatin; strain and add the flavor. Stir 
on ice till it begins to set, then mix with the whip- 
ped cream. Fill into the cold forms, and set on 
ice till wanted. 

To facilitate the unmolding, the molds may be 
brushed with sweet almond oil or olive oil; other- 
wise the molds have to be dipped in water for a 
moment to loosen the cream. 

After this recipe a variety of creams can be 
made, changing the flavors, to maraschino, orange, 
orange flower; or add some crushed nuts or 
browned almonds. The addition of four ounces 
of chocolate makes a nice CHOCOLATE BA- 
VARIAN CREAM. 

613.— STRAWBERRY BAVARIAN CREAM. 
RASPBERRY BAVARIAN CREAM. 

Prepare the cream same as for No. 607, and fill 
into the forms without any lining. 

Other fruit creams of this kind can be made 
with crushed cherries, peaches, apricots and red 
currants, using one pint of crushed fruit, two 
ounces of gelatin, one pound of sugar, and one 
and a half pints of double cream. 

614.— BAVARIAN CREAM IN LAYERS. 
CREME BAVAROIS PANACHSe. 

Prepare three or four of the creams, as straw- 
berry, vanilla, chocolate, and one white cream 
same as No. 604. Fill into the forms in layers in 
the same manner as for No. 603. 

Other flavors in which the creams are made are 
coffee, tea, caramel, etc. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS

69 



The creams are generally served plain; but for 
more effect they may be decorated with whipped 
cream and French fruits. 



615-BLANC- MANGE. 

Blanc-Mange means a white mixture; but it 
is made in a variety of colors, like the Bavarian 
creams. 

Blanc-Manges are generally made of a firmer 
texture than the foregoing creams, but may be 
greatly improved and made light by adding a part 
of whipped cream, or whites of eggs in the form 
of a meringue, to the mixture just before the 
cream thickens on ice, in the same way as for the 
Charlotte and Bavarian creams. 

6x6.— ALMOND BLANC-MANGE. 

1 quart of milk, i quart of cream, 12 ozs. sngar, 

2 ozs. gelatin, }i lb. almonds, a few bitter almonds 

or peach kernels. 

Soak the gelatin in a little cold water; blanch 
the almonds and pound in the mortar to a soft 
paste, adding some milk. Put the milk, sugar 
and almonds on the fire, and let come near to a 
boil; remove and set in a warm place for half an 
hour, well covered, to draw the flavor of the 
almonds; add the gelatin. Strain and press 
through a fine cloth, flavor with a few drops of 
orange flower extract and add the cream. Beat 
on ice till it begins to thicken and set, then fill into 
forms. Serve same way as the Bavarian creams. 

A plainer and less expensive blancmange may 
be made after the same recipe, adding half a pint 
more of milk, and leaving out the almonds; add- 
ing almond extract for Almond Blanc-Mange, and 
other extracts and colorings for the other kinds. 

617 —CHOCOLATE BLANC-MANGE. 
Add to No. 616 four ounces of chocolate, or 
cocoa powder, and four ounces more sugar, and 
finish in the same manner. 

618.— BLANC-MANGE WITH COFFEE. 
BLANC-MANGE AU CAFfi 

Add to No. 616 half a pint of strong black cofiee; 
leave out half a pint of the milk, and finish same 
as the others. 

619.— BLANC-MANGE A LA REINE. 
BLANC-MANGE WITH FRUIT. 

Prepare the mixture No. 616 with three pints 
of plain cream. 

Take one pint of double cream, beat it to a 
firm froth, adding it to the almond cream before 
it begins to set; adding also at the same time one- 
half a pint of mixed candied fruits soaked in 
maraschino syrup and cut in very small pieces 
Serve with a border of whipped cream, colored 
pink and flavored with rose extract. 



STRAWBERRY BLANC-MANGE. 

RASPBERRY BLANC-MANGE. 

Prepare the mixture No. 616 with three pints 

cf plain cream, and add one pint of sweetened 

fruit juice and some color before the cream 

thickens. Beat and mix well and fill into forms. 

621.— BLANC-MANGE WITH LIQUORS. 
To mixture No. 616 add suitable liquors, as 
sherry, rum, maraschino, noyeau, etc. 

622.— BLANC-MANGE, PANACHfeE. 

Prepare same as Bavarian Cream No. 614, let- 
ting each layer set before adding the next layer. 

The Blanc-Manges may be made with fresh 
berries in season, adding the berries in layers 
between the cream. 



623.— FRENCH CREAMS. 

CREMES A LA FRANCAIS. 
The French Creams consist of custards, which 
are set w-th gelatin, and made light by beating 
the custard on ice till the gelatin begins to set, 
same way as for the blanc-mange. 

624.— FRENCH VANILLA CREAM. 

CREME FRANCAIS A LA VANILLE. 
3 pints of cream, 12 ozs. of sugar, 12 yolks, 

i^ ozs. of gelatin. 

Soak the gelatin in a little cold water; beat 
yolks and sugar, add the cream gradually, put on 
the fire and stir till it thickens. Take ofi at 
once, add the dissolved gelatin, and strain into a 
basin set on ice. Add the flavor and beat con- 
stantly till it begins to set. Fill into oiled forms, 
and keep on ice till firm. Unmold and serve like 
blanc-mange. 

623.— CHOCOLATE CREAM. 

CREME FRANCAIS AU CHOCOLAT. 

Add four ounces of chocolate to No. 624; let 
dissolve with the sugar before adding the cream 
and yolks. Serve with a border of whipped cream. 

626 COFFEE CREAM. 

CREME FRANCAIS AU CAFfe. 
Add half a pint of strong coSee to No. 624. Leave 
out one-half pint of cream, and finish in the same 
manner. 

627.— TORTONI CREAM. 

CREME TORTONI A LA FRANCAIS. 

Add to the vanilla cream No. 624 four ounces 
of crushed and browned almonds and macaroons. 
Fill into forms as usual, and serve with whipped 
cream. 

628.— FRENCH CREAM WITH FRUIT. 

CREME FRANCAIS, MACEDOINE. 
Prepare the cream No. 624 without the vanilla; 
flavor maraschino before it begins to set on the 



7° PAUL RICHARD'S BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 

ice; add a macedoine of French fruits, consisting 
of apricots, cherries, angelica and pineapple cut 
in dice. Fill into the forms, and serve with whip- 
ped cream. 



629.— FRENCH CREAM WITH PEACHES. 
CREME FRANCAIS AUX PECHES. 
Prepare one pint of peach marmalade No. 11. 
Make a cream with one quart of cream, six 
ounces of sugar, ten yolks and two ounces of 
gelatin, as in No. 624. Mix with the marmalade 
before it cools; beat on ice till it thickens; fill 
into forms and set on ice to settle. Serve in 
a border of whipped cream. 

Cream with apricots may be made in the same 
manner; also cream with strawberries or rasp- 
berries, adding one pint of crushed and sweet- 
ened fruit pulp and a little coloring. 

630.— FRENCH CREAM with LIQUORS 

FRENCH CREAM with MARASCHINO. 
CREME FRANCAIS au MARASQUIN. 
The French Creams with liquors are made after 
the recipe No. 624, adding maraschino. Char- 
treuse, Benedictine, etc. 

631.-WHIPPED CREAM with fruit in cases. 

MOUSSE AU FRUITS en caisse. 
I pint of double cream whipped to a firm froth, 
I pint of crushed fruit, i lb. sugar, i^ ozs. gelatin, 

Soak the gelatin, mix the sugar and crushed 
fruit, heat lightly and add the gelatin; stir till 
cold, and before it sets add the whipped cream, 
and fill into molds or paper cases. Decorate with 
plain whipped cream, and serve. 

Strawberry, raspberry, apricot and peach 
mousse are prepared in this manner. 

A lighter kind of mousse can be made without 
the gelatin (for immediate use) from dry whipped 
cream. Take one quart of double cream, beat 
firm and let drain on a sieve for thirty minutes. 
Before serving add three-quarters of a pint of 
sweetened fruit pulp, and draw it lightly into the 
whipped cream. Chocolate, coffee, liquors and 
extracts may be added in place of fruits. These 
creams should be served at once, because they 
soften quickly, being without gelatin to keep them 
firm. 

In place of paper cases, meringue baskets or 
small patty cases may be used for holding the 
creams. See Nos. 131, 317, 381 and 396. 



BAKED CUSTARDS. 

632.— CUP CUSTARD WITH VANILLA. 

2 quarts of rich milk, I2 ozs. of sugar, 10 eggs, 

vanilla extract. 

Beat eggs and sugar and add the warmed milk; 
add flavor and a pinch of salt, fill into cups; set 



the cups in a pan with hot water and bake in a 
medium heat till done (which may be ascertained 
by inserting the blade of a thin knife in the centre 
of the custard: if the blade appears dry, the cus- 
tard is done.) 

A variety of custards may be made after this 
recipe by adding chocolate, cofiee, orange or 
lemon rind or extracts, nuts or almonds, etc. 

The custards should be served iced, and may 
be served plain, or with a spoonful of whipped 
cream on top. 

633.— FRENCH CARAMEL CUSTARD. 

CREME RENVERSE AU CARAMEL. 

Boil one pound of granulated sugar to the 
caramel degree (No. 67). As soon as it turns to 
a golden color, add a little water and reduce it to 
the soft ball degree. Fill a thin layer of this 
syrup while hot into the bottom of timbale molds; 
let cool. Rub the sides of the molds with some 
melted butter or olive oil. Prepare the custard 
No. 160; flavor vanilla. Fill into the molds and 
bake same as the cup custard No. 632. When 
done, take from the water and let cool. 

To serve: loosen the custard lightly from the 
sides with the tip of the finger and turn upside 
down into the dish the custard is to be served in. 
The caramel in the bottom of the mold forms a 
syrup, which serves as the sauce. 

The most particular part of this custard is the 
baking. Too much baking makes the custard 
curdle and turn watery. 

Custards with other flavors may be made after 
this recipe, to be turned from the molds when cold. 

634.— BOILED CUSTARD. 
CUSTARD CREAM. 
CUSTARD SIDE DISHES. 
2 quarts milk, 10 ozs. sugar, i}i ozs. cornstarch, 
8 yolks, 5 whole eggs, flavor. 

Dissolve the starch in some cold milk. Let the 
other milk and sugar come to a boil, stir in the 
starch; take off the fire, pour the milk over the 
well-beaten eggs; return to the fire a moment for 
the eggs to thicken; strain and flavor. 

This custard serves for many purposes. It may 
be stirred cold on ice, or poured hot over the fruit 
or cake you intend to serve with it. 

A large variety of SIDE DISHES may be 
made with boiled custard for lunch counters and 
hotel use, by baking small cases or tart shells from 
pufi-paste or pie crust or short paste; filling the 
bottom with berries, cherries or peaches; sweeten 
and pour over some custard. Or bake the fruit 
in the cases, pour over the custard and decorate 
with a meringue

635.-GELATIN JELLIES. 

These jellies are made with wines, fruit juices 
and liquors. The gelatin is added to give firm- 
ness to the mixture, so it can be turned from the 
molds. For this reason the jellies served in 
glasses can be made more delicate, and require 
less gelatin than the jellies which have to be taken 
from the molds. 

As the gelatins are not uniform it often takes a 
little experimenting to obtain the proper results. 
The wine jellies may be made from wine only, 
but the process is too expensive. It is best to 
make a stock jelly from lemon juice, water, sugar 
and spices, and add the wine or liquors. 

For the Fruit jellies the fruit juice is filtered and 
mixed with even quantities of simple syrup No. 61, 
to which the gelatin is added. It is advisable to use 
a little more gelatin during the summer months, 
or in places where the jellies are served in a hot 
kitchen. The warm atmosphere keeps the jellies 
soft, and if not sufficient gelatin is added the 
jellies run flat or break, and become unfit to serve. 

A jelly is best if made the day before using it, 
so it may be well set before it is served. 

636.— STOCK JELLY. 

8 ozs. gelatin, 4^ quarts of water, 3 lbs. sugar, 
10 lemons, the rind of i orange and 2 lemons, 
I oz. mixed spices (consisting of whole cloves, 
allspice, cinnamon and a blade of mace), 
7 whites of eggs, and the clean shells of the eggs. 

Soak the gelatin in the water for half an hour, 
add the strained juice of the lemons, the spices, 
the rind and sugar, the clean egg shells, crushed, 
and the whites beaten up half. 

For the boiling use a large pan or kettle which 
holds about three or four gallons, as the jelly rises 
considerably during boiling. 

Set on the fire and let come to a slow boil; let 
boil for about ten minutes from the time it begins 
to boil, or till the whites of eggs curdle. Take 
ofi the fire and let rest for a moment. Wet the 
flannel or felt jelly bag in hot water, wring it and 
hang in the jelly box; fill with the jelly; let run 
into a clean basin, and return it to the bag several 
times, till it runs perfectly clear. Keep the bag 
well covered in a warm place till the jelly has all 
run through. 

Add to this jelly one quart of wine, or one pint 
of liquor, as directed; add appropriate colors, fill 
into molds; let rest on ice from four to five hours, 
or till ready to serve. 

To use: dip the mold in hot water for a second 
and turn out on the dish to be served in. 

Bright, shallow glass dishes are the best for 
serving jellies. They may be served in a border 
of whipped cream; or a part of the jelly may be 



colored in an opposite color, filled into a shallow 
pan in a thin layer about one-quarter inch deep, 
and after it is hardened cut into small diamonds, 
stars or crescents and used for decoration. 

From this Stock Jelly all the different wine and 
liquor jellies can be made without giving a sepa- 
rate recipe for each jelly. 

637.— RIBBON JELLY. 

GELEE A LA POUSSE CAFfi. 
Take from the clear Stock Jelly. Flavor one 
part maraschino, color pink; one part creme de 
menthe, color light green; one part Chartreuse, 
or sherry color (dark yellow); leave one part clear, 
flavor with white wine. Fill the jeUy in alternate 
colors into high narrow glasses, letting each layer 
set before adding the next layer. Finish the top 
with whipped cream, sweetened and flavored, and 
serve. 

638.— CHAMPAGNE JELLY. 

Make the Stock Jelly lightly spiced; add one 
quart of dry sweet catawba, or any other white 
wine of good flavor. Cool the jelly on ice till it 
nearly sets. Beat the jelly with the egg-beater 
lightly till some bubbles appear in the jelly. The 
bubbles are caught in the setting jelly, and a part 
will rise to the top, forming a white froth. Fill 
at once into champagne glasses and set on ice. 

The foam on the top becomes firm, and the 
rising bubbles in the centre make it look like real 
champagne. 

For a more expensive Champagne Jelly, one pint 
of champagne may be added to the setting jelly 
at the proper moment, so the bubbles are caught 
in the jelly, which will make it still more real. 

A very nice jelly of this kind may be made by 
adding ginger ale or sparkling cider to plain jelly, 
and finish like the Champagne Jelly. For a hoax, 
a straw may be placed into the glass, or a cherry 
in the centre of the jelly to make it look like a 
cocktail, etc. 

A more plain way of making Champagne Jelly 
is to fill the glasses partly with clear jelly; beat 
some jelly light, adding some beaten whites of 
eggs, and fill on top of the clear jelly. 

639.— WINE AND LIQUOR JELLIES WITH 
FRUIT. 
Take a clear wine or liquor jelly, fill one layer 
of jelly in the bottom of the small individual 
molds, put on ice till the jelly is set. Place on 
top of the jelly half a preserved peach or apricoti 
or take a round slice of pineapple. Place a cherry 
in the centre, or use fresh ripe berries of any kind, 
putting them in symmetrically. On top of the 
fruit fill more jelly which is almost ready to set. 
Place on ice to get firm. 



72 



PAUL RICHARD S BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



To unmold: dip the mold in hot water a second, 
tnrn over on dish, and serve in a border o{ whip- 
ped cream. 

640.— SWISS PEACH MERINGUE. 

Line a dome-shaped jelly mold with a pink 
colored marschino jelly, then place half a pre- 
served peach in the bottom and fill some more of 
the jelly over the fruit, and set cold to become 
firm. Prepare the Charlotte Russe Cream No. 
601 and fill on top of the fruit. 

To serve: turn out so the fruit appears on top. 
Serve in a border of whipped cream. 

641.— MACEDOINE OF FRUIT. 

Line a jelly mold with a clear liquor jelly. 
After the jelly has set, put in one layer of straw- 
berries or raspberries; pour over a little jelly and 
let set. Put on one layer of ripe peaches cut in 
dice; more jelly; then a layer of blackberries or 
blue grapes; a little more jelly, and a layer of 
green grapes, etc., and continue in alternating 
layers till the form is filled. Keep on ice till firm 
and serve with whipped cream, or with a cold 
cream sance. 

For a large party this jelly may be made very 
attractive in a border mold with a large centre 
tube; filling the centre, after the jelly is turned 
from the mold, with whipped cream. Or, by 
making a separate Bavarian cream in a mold 
which fits into the centre of the border mold, and 
place this in the centre when ready to serve. 

The macedoines may be made with any fruit in 
season, or in combination with French fruits 
glaces, or preserved fruits. 

The French fruits should be softened in a 
liquor syrup before using. 

642.— STRAWBERRY AND RASPBERRY 

JELLIES WITH GELATIN. 

I quart water, i quart fruit juice, 2 lbs. sugar, 

3 ozs. gelatin. 

Soak the gelatin, make a clear syrup of the 
water and sugar, filter the fruit juice same way as 
for fruit syrups (see No. 58). Add the gelatin to 
the hot syrup, and mix with the fruit juice. Add 
a little coloring, if required; fill into forms, like 
other jellies. 

643.— ORANGE JELLY. 

Take one pint of simple syrup No. 61. Have 
it very clear. Press the juice of twelve oranges 
and two lemons to make one pint of juice; add 
one and one-half ounces of soaked gelatin to the 
warm syrup, and mix syrup and the filtered juice. 
Fill into forms, let become firm and serve. 

A favorite way f serving this jelly is to cut 
baskets from oranges, scallop the sides and handle 



and remove the pulp. The juice may be used for 
the jelly. Set the baskets on ice, or, better, in a 
freezing closet to get firm, and fill with the jelly. 
Decorate with cherries and angelica. 

The jelly may be served as a ribbon jelly, one 
part colored a deep red, like blood orange, and 
the other part orange yellow; and filled into the 
forms in alternating layers. 

644.— LEMON JELLY. 

Prepare like the Orange Jelly No. 643. Use 
one pound of sugar, one and one-half ounces of 
gelatin, the juice of ten lemons, and enough water 
to make one quart syrup and juice. 

Other jellies of this kind can be made in the 
same proportions, using one pint of strong 
cofEee or tea, with one pint of syrup; or one pint 
of wine, with the same amount of gelatin. 

The juice of some lemons may be added and 
clari&ed with the syrup to liquor jellies; also to 
jellies with the fiavor of orange flower or violets 
and roses. 

645.— PUNCH JELLY. 
Prepare the Orange or Lemon Jelly, Nos. 643 
and 644, and flavor with some good rum. 

646.— CRUSHED FRUITS AND COMPOTES 
OF FRUIT IN FORMS. 
Prepare berries and other fruits ia the same 
way as for marmalade (see Preserves No. 13). 
Use ten ounces of sugar to each quart of fruit 
(more if the fruit is very tart). Stir juice and 
sugar till well dissolved and clear. Warm lightly 
and add one ounce of dissolved gelatin. Stir 
slowly on ice till it begins to thicken, then fill into 
forms. Let become firm and serve with cream. 

647.— COMPOTE OF MIXED FRUITS. 

Line a large compote or melon form with a 
clear wine or maraschino jelly. Take a mixed 
compote of fruit, or use preserved fruit, as 
cherries, peaches, apricots, greengages, plums, 
etc. Dry the fruit in a clean towel, dip each 
fruit in jelly and arrange it in contrasting layers 
tastefully in the form, filling a little of the jelly 
between the layers till the form is filled. Let be- 
come firmly set, unmold and serve. 

Whole fresh strawberries and raspberries may 
be served in this manner, or the sides of the form 
only may be decorated with the berries; fastening 
the fruit to the jelly lining with nearly set jelly, 
and fill the centre of the decorated form with the 
Charlotte russe mixtures. 

Pineapples, pears, apples and other fruit may 
be used in exactly the same manner With the 
assistance of some cherries and angelica these 
dishes can be made very attractive.

sugar, the scale will sink below the given degree, 
and more sugar should be added until it comes up. 
If it contains too much sugar, the scale rises above 
the required degree, and more water is added un- 
til it comes down to it. 
For the large fancy pieces, and also for the 



baskets, vases and stands from colored water or 
ices, many nice centre pieces may be produced. 

The unmolding of the creams should be done 
in a cold place and as speedily as possible to pre- 
vent the softening of the creams. The dishes on 
which the creams are served should also be kept 
on ice till wanted. 

It is best to serve molded creams on lace paper 
doylies, to prevent sliding on the plates. 

For flavoring, use the fresh fruits as much as 



smaller forms, fill the molds solid with the Creams possible; and, if not in season, the preserved fruit 



or Ices to prevent air-holes. Fill each half of the 
form a little more than full and press both sides 
well together. The large molds should be sealed 
with butter and tied with a string or wire, to pre- 
vent the salt getting into the cream. The small 
individual forms hardly require these precautions, 
if they are close fitting. Brick molds should be 
made to have two covers, that is, top and bottom; 
and the covers should fit OVER the mold, not 
IN the mold. The form opening on both sides 
makes it easy to take out the frozen creams. 

When filling the brick molds, line the bottom 
with manilla paper, fill the form a little more than 
full, level it and place another piece of paper on 
the top;' press the cover down well, tie up and 
pack in ice and salt. 

The large molds take from two to four hours to built with double sides like an ice box, lined with 
freeze; the small individual molds may be frozen zinc, and large enough to keep the creams packed 



and fruit juices, vanilla beans, and the rind of 
oranges and lemons. 

There are very many good extracts of vanilla, 
lemons and oranges, but strawberry, raspberry, 
pineapple, and many other extracts should be 
used with caution, as the most of them are made 
artificial, and after some time turn rancid and 
become unfit for use. 

The use of colors is often required to obtain the 
right shade in molding, and it is cheapest and 
best to buy the colors ready made. 

THE STORING AND KEEPING OF CREAMS 
AND ICES. 

Where several kinds of creams and ices are 
kept on hand, it is profitable to have a storage box 



in from fifteen to thirty minutes. 

To unmold the creams: Wipe off the brine, dip 
the form for a moment in warm water; wipe dry, 
and slip the cream onto a platter, or on the table. 
The bricks may be cut in slices as ordered, or all 
cut in portions, each slice wrapped in wax paper, 
ready to serve, and kept in the ice cave. 



in ice and salt. It is best to make a box like this 
in two or three partitions, each with a separate 
outlet in the bottom to let out the brine; so they 
all may be used at one time, or one part of it 
only, if business is slack and to save ice. 

Lately storage boxes have come into use ia 
hotels where they have a cold storage system. 



While many of the colors may be produced by Where the brine system is used in place of ice 



using the different creams and ices in molding, 
some of the fancy figures require a little touching 
up with artificial colors. The colors are diluted 
with a little syrup. A small brush is used for 
painting. Some colors are also used in powder 



and salt, the cover of the storage box should be 
made in sections, and with a double lid, the outer 
cover to be fastened with hinges, and the inside 
cover (which has to be opened only when the 
cream is to be repacked) to lift out. In the in- 



form, put in a muslin bag, which is very handy side cover are to be cut circular openings to fit 
for making red cheeks on fruit and figures, etc. over the packing cans, which also may be covered. 
To make fruits and flowers look still more This is the best kind of box for storing and keep- 
ing creams, and saves ice and money. 

Porcelain lined cans are the best for keeping 
ices and creams. The best tinned cans, if the 
creams are kept for a longer time, cause an un- 
pleasant metallic taste, while poorly tinned cans 
spoil and discolor the creams. 



natural, fresh leaves and stems are used when in 
season. The artificial leaves, stems and petals 
can be bought all the year around in supply 
stores. 

Some Ice Cream makers dip the creams which 
represent frozen fruits, after painting, in cold 



So 



PAUL RICHARDS BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



Bulk Ice Creams and Ices should be worked 
over once or twice a day to prevent graining, and- 
repacked as often as required. 

OTHER POINTS IN ICE CREAM MAKING. 
All the Ice Creams lose in bulk if they are 
worked over, or transferred into other cans, after 
they have been frozen hard and ripened for some 
time. They become more solid. For this reason 
it is more profitable to the Ice Cream maker to 
transfer his creams as much as possible to the 
cans in which it is sent out in while it is still soft 
and light; that is, at the time when the dasher has 
been removed from the freezing can, after it has 
been worked with the spatula and the flavor added, 
and let the Cream ripen in the cans. 

TO SAVE ICE IN HOT WEATHER wrap 
or cover boxes and tubs with wet bags. 

In cold weather, if the freezing proceeds too 
slow, and the ice won't melt, take some old brine 
and pour it over the ice and salt in the freezing- 
tub; this will make it freeze faster. 

To hasten the freezing of molded creams, use 
very finely crushed ice and mix with a strong brine. 
Coarse salt and sea salt are best for freezing. 
The fine salt, if it has to be used, should be well 
mixed with the ice, otherwise it will form in lumps 
and prevent freezing. 

The finer the crushed ice, the faster the freezing. 

High, narrow freezing cans make creams freeze 

quicker, because they have more freezing surface 

than a low, wide can. They freeze faster and save 

ice. 

Ice Creams made without being heated require 
less sugar and freeze faster, than the rich creams 
made by the hot process. 

Ice Creams made from double cream and by the 
cold process require close attention in freezing. 
These creams should be frozen only till they begin 
to stand up on the dasher like whipped cream — not 
more. More freezing would make this cream 
coarse and run into butter — spoil it. 

Very rich creams which contain eggs, also re- 
quire more sugar. 

Rich Creams and Water Ices freeze slower and 
(require more salt in freezing and packing. Too 
much sugar prevents freezing; not enough sugar 
makes them coarse, like snow. 

Keep all the utensils used perfectly clean, scour. 
ing and scalding them as often as possible. 

BRINE FREEZING. 

The ice machine is coming more and more into 
use in the modern hotel and restaurant. They 
are used for refrigerating, cold storage and ice 
making; and some hotels have applied this system 
also for freezing and storing Ice Creams and Ices. 

My experience of brine freezing has been con- 



fined to two Southern hotels, and I cannot say that 
the system always worked satisfactory, or as good, 
or better, than the ice-and-salt-freezing process. 
We had much trouble to keep the brine at an 
even low temperature; and a rising temperature 
would cause the frozen creams to become too soft 
in the storage box; and sometimes it was very 
difificult to freeze the creams hard enough to be 
served. 

Mechanical refrigerating is practically a new 
industry, and I think the engineers were not quite 
familiar with the new machine, as they were both 
newly installed in the hotels. A part of our 
trouble may have been due to this fact. Or it 
may have been because Ice Cream freezing and 
storing require a lower temperature than the 
ordinary cold storage and ice making, and the 
machine did not have the capacity to cool the ice 
boxes and freeze the creams at the same time. 

The most trouble we had was caused by the 
freezing or choking up of the valves or coils. 
This is due to small particles of moisture which 
enter with the gas from the compressor, which 
gradually accumulates at the bottom of the re- 
frigerating coil, or at the expansion or regulator 
valve. 

If the choking occurs on the valve, it can be 
cleared away quickly by throwing the valve open 
to its fullest extent. 

To clear the refrigerating coil is more trouble- 
some, and requires thR shutting down of the ma- 
chine for some hours. 

It is also necessary about every three or four 
weeks to clean the separator, to keep the machine 
in good working order. 

Other times, the machine being short of gas, 
caused a rising temperature of the brine, and 
made us trouble. 

BRINE. 
Sodium chloride (common 
chloride is used for brine 
chloride is a by-product of chemical works, and 
is obtained in large quantities in the making of salt 
and ammonia. Both salts are very much alike in 
character; the common salt is mostly used. 

One objection to the sodium chloride brine is 
that it rusts the ice tanks and coils immersed in it, 
and causes considerable wear. This is avoided by 
using a calcium chloride brine. 

A suitable brine for all freezing purposes can be 
made in proportions of four pounds of salt to one 
gallon of water. It is best to mix the brine in a 
separate vessel, and then put it in the freezing tub 
or storage tank. Calcium chloride is used in the 
same proportions, and dissolves best in warm water.

of the cream on the fire with half of the sugar; 
beat the yolks light with the other half of the 
sugar, and thin up with a part of the hot cream; 
put eggs and cream together, and, as soon as it 
begins to thicken, check the boiling by adding the 
one part of cold cream, which had been left out 
for this purpose. The cream is then strained, 
cooled and frozen as usual. 

705.— FRENCH CREAMS. 
The French creams are made in the same man- 
ner as the Italian creams; but the preparations 
differ considerable in richness. While some of 
the creams of this class are made of cream only 
in connection with eggs; others are made of half 
milk and half cream, and some of milk only, with 
plenty of eggs, like a frozen custard.

709 —PHILADELPHIA ICE CREAM. 

This name is generally applied to Ice Creams 
made with pure cream, and without any eggs, 
although some makers use about five eggs to each 
gallon of cream, with two pounds of sugar. 

The cream and sugar is heated near the boiling 
point, cooled and frozen. 

The heating of the cream is the best method, 
for it gives mere body to the cream and makes it 
smoother. 

If the sugar is dissolved in the cream without 
heating, the cream bulks more, but loses the fine 
texture of the heated creams, 

710.— COMMERCIAL ICE CREAMS. 
Where quantity is more required than quality, 



root and sago flour, in proportion from three to 
six ounces to each gallon, is boiled into a smooth 
batter, with a part of the milk and the sugar; 
strained, cooled and frozen. Gelatin should be 
soaked and dissolved in warm milk, but not boiled, 
as this would cause the milk to curdle. About 
one and one-half to two ounces of gelatin are used 
for one gallon of cream and milk. 

Another thickener for Ice Creams is used cold. 
The preparation is known to the trade as cream- 
thick, it is something like a dry milk powder. 
The thickener is mixed with the sugar to be used, 
the cold milk or cream added gradually. As soon 
as the sugar is dissolved, the cream is ready to be 
frozen.

it thickens and pour it over the beaten eggs, 
stirring constantly. Add the cream, strain, cool, 
flavor to suit, and freeze. 

This recipe may be made without eggs. 

To use GELATIN in the above recipe : Leave 
out the starch and soak one and one-half to two

724.— NUT ICE CREAMS. 
Nut Creams are made in several ways. Chest- 
nuts, almonds, filberts, etc., may be used in pulp 
form and frozen with the creams. For other 
nuts, as the English walnuts and pecans, it is 
best to add the chopped nuts after the cream is 
frozen and flavored. 

725.— CHESTNUT ICE CREAM. 
MARRON GLACE. 
Use the French preserved marrons; or, take 
one pound of blanched and peeled chestnuts. 
Boil or steam till soft, and pound in the mortar 
to a smooth paste. Let this paste infuse in one 
gallon of French cream, and cool; or, add the 
paste to the cream before heating; flavor, when 
cool, with maraschino, noyeau or vanilla extract, 
and freeze as usual. 

726.— ALMOND ICE CREAM. 
FILBERT ICE CREAM. 
Blanch and pound one pound of the nuts, 
either almond or filbert, into paste, and proceed 
same as for Chestnut Cream. 

727.^PISTACHIO ICE CREAM. 

Prepare a paste with twelve ounces of blanched 
pistachio nuts; add the paste to one gallon of 
Philadelphia Ice Cream No. 709 before freezing. 
Color the cream a delicate green, flavor Maras- 
chino or Kirschwasser and freeze as Tisual. 

If pistachio nuts cannot be had, use almonds 
blanched and lightly browned, and flavor with 
extract of pistachio. 

A combination of orange flower, rose and bitter 
almond extracts have almost the same flavor as 
the genuine pistachio nuts. 

In making nut creams many makers prefer to 
roast the nuts slightly before pounding or chop- 
ping, as this brings out a more delicate flavor. 

728.— BISQUE ICE CREAM. 

GRAPENUT ICE CREAM. 
SHREDDED WHEAT ICE CREAM. 
BROWN BREAD ICE CREAM. 
Add to one gallon of French Vanilla Ice Cream 
one pound of powdered macaroons, or crushed 
and sifted wafers and meringues, which should be 
perfectly dry. 

The cream may be flavored also with sherry 
wine or maraschino. 

The Chocolate, Caramel and Coffee Ice Creams 
may also be made into Bisque Ice Creams; add- 
ing the dried and sifted crumbs. 

Another way to make a nice Bisque Ice Cream 
is to add about half a pound of Grapenuts, or 



PAUL RICHARDS BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS, 

Shredded Wheat Biscuits; or dry some brown 
bread in the oven, crush fine with some browned 
almonds and mix with the HOT cream; cool and 
flavor vanilla or sherry, and freeze as usual. This 
makes Grapenut, Shredded Wheat or Brown 
Bread Ice Cream. 

729.— TORTONI ICE CREAM. 

Add to one gallon of Philadelphia or French 
Ice Cream, after it is frozen, an Italian Meringue 
made from one-half pint of whites of eggs and 
one pound of sugar made into syrup. Beat the 
meringue cold on ice, and add eight ounces of 
browned and sifted almonds and eight ounces of 
macaroons; mix well with the creams, let ripen, 
and serve flavored with sherry or maraschino. 

This cream may be served also in paper cases 
like the Glacis. 

730.— ICE CREAMS WITH FRUIT. 

In making Fruit Creams, the cream should be 
partly frozen before adding the fruit juice or 
pulp. 

These creams also require more sugar; other- 
wise the fruit should be sweetened before adding- 
it to the frozen cream. The amount of sugar 
depends on the acidity of the fruits used. Pre- 
served fruits which contain sugar require no addi- 
tional sweetening. 

Creams which contain fruit are best kept in 
porcelain-lined cans or earthen jars. Tinned 
cans and copper vessels are cpt to produce 
poisonous compounds in connection with fruit 
acids, and become injurious to the consumer. 

731.— STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM. 
I gallon cream, 2^ lbs. sugar, 4 quarts berries. 

Prepare and freeze the cream with half of the 
sugar, same as the Philadelphia Ice Cream No. 709. 
Crush the berries, rub through strainer or sieve, 
and mix with the rest of the sugar. When the 
cream is nearly frozen, add the berries, mix in 
well with the spatula and let ripen for one hour. 

Another way, is to take from the standard cream 
No. 714, or any other plain creams which contain 
the usual amount of sugar, and add sweetened and 
crushed fruit, and some coloring, if required. 
Pack away and let ripen for one hour. 

Another way, is to mix even parts of frozen 
Fruit Ice and Ice Cream, add coloring and more 
flavor and use. 

Other Ice Creams with fruit may be made in 
the manner as given above; adding to each gallon, 
of French, plain or Philadelphia Ice Cream two 
quarts of fresh or preserved sweetened fruit juice 
or pulp; work well in the frozen cream, and let 
ripen. 

Banana, pineapple, apples, peaches and apricots 
may be used, all in the same proportions,

infuse with the grated peel of six grape fruits for 
one hour. Add the juice of grape fruits and 
oranges; strain and freeze. 

745.— GRAPE FRUIT WITH MARASCHINO 
ICE. 

A favorite way to serve the grape fruit is to cut 
the fruit in halves; with a sharp knife cut out the 
centre core; fill the cavity with a rich Maraschino 
Ice or Kirschwasser Punch, and decorate with 
candied fruit. 

Another way is to place a spoonful of Lemon 
Ice in the centre, and cover with a. fruit salad 
flavored with sherry or rum. 

Very large oranges or small cantaloupes may be 
served in the same manner. 

745 A.— MARASCHINO ICE. 
Prepare the Lemon Ice with four pounds of 
sugar, twelve lemons, and one gallon of water. 
Before freezing, add four beaten whites of eggs; 
freeze nice and smooth, and incorporate half a 
pint of the best maraschino with the spatula; 
then it is ready to serve. 

746.— MELON ICE. 

CANTALOUP ICE. 

Both Ices may be made after the same recipe. 
Scoop the pulp from the melons in spoonfuls, 
take out the seeds, sweeten with simple syrup 
and flavor with sherry wine. Mix syrup and pulp 
well, without crushing. Pack in ice and salt, and 
freeze without stirring. This will take about 
three hours or more Serve in glasses. 

For cantaloups the juice of oranges and brandy 
may be added in place of the sherry wine, and 
the Ice may be served in the scooped-out rind of 
the cantaloups. 

747.— FROZEN BANANAS AND ORANGES. 

Peel the oranges, remove the white skin, pull 
apart in pieces, take off all the white pith, re- 
move the seeds (or, better, use seedless oranges ). 

Peel and cut the bananas in short small strips. 



Cover the fruit with a syrup, which may be 
flavored with rum or maraschino. Let macerate 
for a couple of hours. Mix the fruit into a Pine- 
apple or Lemon Ice; pack in ice and salt for one 
hour, and serve in glasses, or the natural fruit 
baskets. 

748.— MACEDOINE ICES. 

TUTTI FRUTTI ICES. 

These Ices are made of fresh fruits in season; 
also from combinations of fresh and preserved 
fruits, and of the candied fruits, the French 
Fruits Glaces. 

All fruits which are frozen in the Ices have to 
be soaked in a strong liquor syrup before using; 
have to macerate; otherwise, the fruit would 
freeze too nard, and be unfit for use. 

Take any combination of fruits in contrasting 
colors, to make a pleasing ei'cct, cut in dice and 
cover with a syrup flavored with suitable liquors, 
and let stand for some hours before using. 

The Macedoine Ices are also served as a frozen 
fruit salad, Fruit Salad Glac^ as it is termed. 
The macerated fruit is mixed with a Pineapple, 
Lemon, Orange or Maraschino Ice and served 
single, or in combination with other Ices or 
Creams. 

749.— FRUIT SALAD GLACfi. 
Take oranges, bananas, pineapple, peaches, 
cherries, strawberries or raspberries, also grapes. 
Peel the oranges, remove the pith and seeds. 
Cut grapes in halves and take out the seeds. 
Large strawberries may be quartered, and the 
other fruit cut in dice. Macerate the fruit for 
two hours and mix into a frozen Pineapple Ice, 
and pack in ice and salt to ripen for one hour. 



CUPS. 

750.— TUTTI FRUITTI ICES IN CUPS. 

The Macedoine Ices are also served as a cup. 
The fruit is macerated in a liquor syrup, but not 
frozen with the Ice. The fruit is served in the 
cup, on or between a layer of fruit Ice or Cream, 
as it may be. 

Although these cups contain liquors, they are 
not served between the courses like a punch; the 
cups are served as a dessert, and often take the 
place of the cold pudding or the ice cream. 

A larger glass, something like a goblet, is better 
suited for cups than the ordinary punch glass. 

751.— AMERICAN CUP. 
Cover the bottom of the glass with a layer of 
Orange Ice, or Pineapple Ice, and half fill with a 
macedoine of fruit flavored with some good rum

764.— ROSE SHERBET. 
Prepare the Maraschino Ice No. 745, or the 
Apple Sherbet No. 759; color pink and flavor 
with extract of rose, or rose cordial, and freeze 
as usual. 

765.— ORIENTAL SHERBET. 
Prepare a light Raspberry Ice, flavor with 
vanilla, and also with a few drops of rose extract. 
Freeze as usual. Before serving, mix with a 
macedoine of fruit, consisting of sultanas, cur- 
rants, candied orange peel and pineapple cut very 
fine and soaked in maraschino syrup. Or, put 
the sherbet in the glasses and sprinkle the fruit 
on top before serving. 

766.— VANILLA SHERBET. 
Use either the Lemon Sherbet without the 
grated rind of the lemons, or use the Apple Sher- 
bet No. 759. Color pink and flavor vanilla. 

767.— ORANGE FLOWER SHERBET. 
Take the Orange Ice or Sherbet withoi^t in- 
fusing any of the grated rind. Freeze smooth, 
and flavor after it is frozen with the extract of 
orange flower. 

768.— CHOCOLATE SHERBET. 

4 lbs. sugar, i^ lbs. chocolate or cocoa powder, 

5 quarts water, 1 oz. gelatin or 6 whites of eggs, 

vanilla flavor. 
Soak the gelatin in cold water. Make the 
chocolate and sugar into a syrup with the water; 
add the gelatin while the syrup is hot, stir till dis- 
solved; cool and freeze as usual. 

769.— CHOCOLATE SHERBET. 

GRANITO A LA PORTO RICO. 

Prepare the Chocolate Sherbet without the 
eggs or gelatin. Freeze without much stirring to 
a coarse mush. Fill the glasses half with the 
granito, and place on top a spoonful of sweetened 
whipped cream. 

Other varieties of Chocolate Sherbets are made 
by adding chopped nutmeats or crushed maca- 
roons. Some chocolate ices are served with a 
spoonful of Vanilla Ice Cream on top. 

The confectioners' supply stores sell a variety 
of forms in which cups and saucers, glasses and 
bowls may be frozen from clear or colored water. 
These cups and glasses may be prepared before- 
hand and kept in the ice cave. They melt very 
slow and last longer than the ices. 

A still more elaborate way of serving is to set 

the frozen cups into a nest of spun sugar before 

serving. 

770.— FRAPPfeS. 

The Frapp^s are similar to the Granitos. There 

is no standard how much they should be frozen, 

and Granitos are often served as Frapp^s. The 



opinions of the best caterers differ on this subject. 
The word frappe means cold, and if a drink is 
served iced, this is termed "en frappe." Gener- 
ally the Frappes are served at dances, receptions, 
etc., and should be in such a liquid condition so 
they can be sipped. 

The Frappes are not made as rich as the sher- 
bets or ices, but more like a plain lemonade, 
about half as sweet as the water ices. Many 
Frappes are liked best with a slice of orange or 
pineapple floating in it, or a few ripe strawberries. 
Of course caterers make the Frappes as rich as 
their patrons desire to have them. 

A standard rule for the plain Frappfe is about 
two pounds of sugar to one gallon of water, and 
sufficient fruit juice and flavor to make a good 
lemonade. 

CHOCOLATE, COFFEE AND TEA SHER- 
BET are also served as a Frapp^; also combi- 
nation Frappes which have three or four kinds of 
fruit floating in the Frapp6. 

They are best prepared cold, like the Granitos. 
When the mixture is ready, put it in a packing 
can in ice and salt; but use very little salt, so the 
ice freezes only lightly. It should have only a few 
fine ice crystals floating in it when ready to serve. 

On short notice, mix even parts of fruit ice and 
water, add a little more lemon juice or acid, and 
serve. 

On some occasions Frappes are also served as 
a cup, in which case they contain wine or 
liquors, or both, in combination with fruit juices. 
They are in fact cold punches, but are served in 
disguise where something with a stick in it is re- 
quired. Very little sugar is used in these cups. 
The mixtures are not frozen, they are made in 
large bowls or pitchers, and cooled with a piece 
of ice floating in it. 

771.— LEMON FRAPPE. 
I gallon water, 2 lbs. sugar, 12 to 16 lemons. 

Prepare and freeze as directed above. 

772.— ORANGE FRAPPfe.

822.— MILK I^UNQH. 
X gallon milk, i lb. sugar, i qua.¥t double cream 
}i pint brandy, }4 pi'nt*rum. 
Freeze milk and sugar to a soft mush like a 
granito; add the liquors, axid, last, the double 
cream, beaten to a firm froth. Serve with some 
grated nutmeg on top of each glass. 

823.— FROZEN EGG NOGG. 

Take one gallon of cream, ten yolks, one and 
one-half pounds of sugar. 

Prepare and freeze same as for French Ice 
Cream. Take twelve whole eggs and one pound 
of sugar, beat together, first warm and then cold, 
like for sponge cake. When the cream is about 
half frozen, add this mixture and finish freezing. 
Incorporate one pint of brandy and one pint of 
mm, and serve with some grated nutmeg on top 
of each glass. 

If a richer mixture is required, take only two 
quarts of cream and all the other ingredients. 

Another way of making this punch, is to take 
twenty-four yolks, one pound of sugar, one quart 
of sherry, one pint of rum, three pints of whipped 
cream. Beat yolks and sugar together; add the 
wine and set on a slow fire, or in boiling water. 
Stir constantly till the mixture begins to thicken. 
Take ofi the fire and beat cold on ice. Place in 
the freezer and freeze smooth, then add the rum, 
and last, the whipped cream. Draw the cream 
in lightly without much stirring. Serve at once, 
with a little grated nutmeg on top of each glass. 

824.— COFFEE PUNQH. 
Prepare the Coflee Frapp^ No. 775; add one 
quart of cream and freeze smooth. Make a mer- 



ingue with one pint of egg-whites and one pound 
of sugar; add this to the frozen mixture, also one 
pint of brandy and one-half pint of kirschwasser. 
In place of the meringue, one quart of sweet- 
ened whipped cream may be added with the liquors. 

825.— GLACfiS. 

MOUSSES GLACfiES. 

The frozen Mousses are simply whipped cream, 
sweetened and flavored with fruits, extracts, etc. 

To make these Glacis perfect, good double 
cream is required, which should be two days old. 
The cream is beaten cold to a firm froth and set 
on ice to drain in a sieve. After the cream is 
drained, it is sweetened with powdered sugar or 
syrup, fruit pulps, chopped nuts or macaroons, 
etc. ; filled into melon or brick molds; packed in 
ice and salt, and frozen. 

The small individual Glacis, also the Biscuit 
Glacis, are filled into paper cases and frozen in 
the ice cave. 

Another way to make the Glac&, is to prepare 
the mixture same as for Charlotte Russe, with a 
small quantity of gelatin (see No. 607). The 
mixing of the whipped cream with the other in- 
gredients should be done without too much stir- 
ring, in order to keep the creams as light as pos- 
sible. 

826.— VANILLA GLACfi. 

Beat one quart of double cream to a firm froth, 
drain on ice in sieve for thirty minutes, sweeten 
with eight ounces of powdered sugar; flavor with 
vanilla extract. Fill the mixture into molds or 
cases and freeze as directed. 

827.— FRUIT GLAC6. 

MOUSSE GLACfi AUX FRUITS. 
I quart of double cream beaten and drained, 
}i pint of fruit juice or pulp, 10 to 12 ounces of 
powdered sugar. 

Mix fruit pulp with the sugar, and make a 
syrup; add to the whipped cream and mix care- 
fully. Fill into forms and freeze. 

A favorite way of serving the fruits Glacfe is to 
take melon or bomb forms, line the sides with ice 
creams or water ices in contrasting colors, and fill 
the centre with the mousse preparation. 

More fruit and sugar can be used, but it makes 
a less lighter mixture, and an addition of gelatin 
is required to keep the mousse from getting too 
heavy. 

828.— CHOCOLATE GLACfe. 

MOUSSE GLAC6 AU CHOCOLAT 
I quart double cream, i lb. sugar, 3 ozs. cocoa, 
4 whites of eggs, vanilla flavor.

Tee; or use a Chocolate or Coffee Ice for a com- 
bination. Return the case to the ice cave till 
ready to serve, 

A more simple way of making the Biscuit 
Glac6 is to take one pint of rich French or New 
York Ice Cream; flavor to suit, and mix with one 
pint of whipped cream; fill into cases and pro- 
ceed as given above. 

840.— BISCUIT SOUFFLE GLACfi. 
IMITATION SOUFFLE. 
To imitate the baked Souffles, a rim of stout 
paper is fastened one inch high around the case, 
to permit the filling above the case. The biscuit 
preparation is filled in and frozen in the ice cave. 
On the top of the Souffle are sifted some finely- 
crushed and browned almond macaroons. Before 
serving, remove the paper band, and it will have 
the appearance of having risen from the case, 
like a baked Souffle. 

841.— ITALIAN SOUFFLE GLACfi. 

I quart double cream, i lb. sugar, % pint water, 

10 whites of eggs. 

Beat the double cream to a froth and drain on 
ice. Boil the sugar and water to a syrup and add 
to the beaten whites, to make an Italian Meringue. 
Beat cold and mix with the whipped cream.

the Biscuits Glaces. 

Like the mousses, this mixture may be made 
into all the former Glacis. 

842.— TORTONI GLACfe. 
Prepare the Biscuit Glace or the Italian Glac^; 
flavor vanilla, and incorporate two ounces of 
crushed macaroons soaked in maraschino, and 
two ounces of browned and crushed almonds. 
Freeze in cases, and decorate with whipped 
cream and candied cherries and angelica. 

843.— FRASCATI GLACfi. 

Fill the cases in three layers: bottom layer, 
Vanilla Cream or Vanilla Glac^; centre, Italian 
Souffle No. 841, flavored with kirschwasser and

The large molds are fitted with covers; seal 
them and bury in ice and salt for three hours. 

The small molds are frozen in the ice cave. 

When frozen, shortly before serving, turn from 



the molds, ice with fondant icing and decorate 
with French fruit. Return to the freezing-box 
till required. 

84s.— COFFEE PARFAIT. 
PARFAIT AU CAFfi.

with kirschwasser; or, take Vanilla Ice Cream, 
flavor with extract of coffee and kirschwasser,

846.-ICE CREAM COMBINATIONS. 

Ice Creams are made more attractive when 
served in layers, Neapolitan style; that is, in com- 
bination with other creams or ices, and frozen 
again in brick, melon or bomb shapes. 

These creams are not so difficult to make, as it 
may seem at first; and for caterers and hotels 
where several kinds of creams and ices are always 
kept on hand, these combinations are easily made 
and often constitute <i. saving, because small 
quantities of left-over creams and ices may be 
combined in this manner and used with profit. 

Some of the combination creams which contain 
liquors, or additions of biscuits, macaroons and 
fruits, may be served as a frozen pudding, with 
a suitable sauce. 

847.— NEAPOLITAN ICE CREAM. 
Fill brick mold in three layers — Vanilla Ice 
Cream, Pistachio Ice Cream and Strawberry Ice 
Cream; or, use an ice between two layers of

soaked in kirschwasser. For the centre, mix New

paste in round even strips, the length of the 
mold. For the bottom layer take Almond or Nut 
Ice Cream; on top of this cream place a layer of 
ladyfingers, soaked in maraschino, colored pink;

Cover with more cream, ladyfingers, and finish 
with cream. 

860.— DIPLOMATIC ICE CREAM. 

In the bottom of the mold place one layer of 
Vanilla Ice Cream, and cover with ladyfinger or 
strips of thin sponge cake soaked in rum; sprinkle 
thickly with a macedoine of fruit; ice cream on 
top of the fruit. Make one or two more layers 
like this, finish the top layer with ice cream, and 
freeze as usual. 

This cream may be served as a frozen pudding, 
with sauce mousseline. 

861,— MANHATTAN ICE CREAM. 

For top and bottom layers use the French 
Vanilla Ice Cream; for the centre, take a frozen 
compote of peaches, strongly flavored with kirsch- 
wasser; or a rich Peach Ice, with plenty of fruit

the French Vanilla Ice Cream, flavor with rum 
and mix with some quartered maraschino cherries; 
finish the top with Pineapple Ice Cream. Pack 
and freeze. 

852— HARLEQUIN ICE CREAM. 
This cream may be made the same as No. 847, 
but in four layers of different colors — red, green, 
white, and yellow; or the form maybe filled with 
the various creams and ices in spoonfuls, to give 
it a marble-like or a mottled effect. 

853.— ICE CREAM A LA REINE.

and arrange in the brick mold in layers of ice 
cream and fruit salad. Repack in ice and salt, 
and serve in slices. 

874.— ICE CREAM TART. 

From the Meringue Paste No. 94 prepare a case 
in the following manner: Take a flat even baking 
pan, rub slightly with butter and dust with flour. 
The meringue may also be dressed on paper. 
Make a bottom of about eight inches in diameter; 
also two rings eight inches wide; also the top, 
which should be dressed like the top of a meringue 
pie, but open in lattice fashion. Let the meringue 
dry in a slow heat. When perfectly dry and crisp, 
put the bottom on a plate, fasten the two rings on 
the bottom with fruit jam or royal icing, fill the 
centre with a suitable frozen ice cream or glac^. 
On top of the cream put a thin layer of Fruit 
Ice and put on the top cover. Place the tart in 
the ice cave till required. 

Small individual tart cases may be made in the 
same manner; or the tart may be served without 
the meringue cover, decorating the top with fancy 
macaroons and whipped cream; or a decoration 
of jelly and royal icing may be piped on, as you 
prefer. 

875.— PEACH A LA MELBA. 
Take a ripe fresh peach, remove the stone; or 
take preserved or a brandy peach; cover it with 
Vanilla Ice Cream in form of a steeple, pour 
around the base a strawberry syrup sauce and 
serve. 

876 —MERINGUE PANACH6 or MERINGUE 
GLACfe. 

Prepare meringues in egg-shapes (see No. 381); 
fill with ice cream and put together. They may 
be tied with a. ribbon, or set in a nest of spun 
sugar, or served in a border of whipped cream. 

Creams of two colors may be served, or one 
fruit ice and one cream in the same shells, and 
are then termed Meringue Panaches, 

877. —ICE CREAM SUGGESTIONS FOR 
HOLIDAYS AND SPECIAL OCCASIONS. 

Many other combinations of frozen creams and 
ices may be devised to suit occasions. 

For Afternoon Receptions, Ladies' Luncheons, 
etc., etc., any of the Glac£ Creams may be served 
in fancy paper cases. Mousses, or creams and 
ices are also served together in sherbet or claret 
glasses. 

For St. Valentine's Day the glacis may be

served in heart-shaped cases, or the creams 
may be frozen in heart-shaped forma. 

For Washington's Birthday, hatchet-shaped 
cases may be used, decorated with candied 
cherries and angelica stems and leaves. Three- 
cornered hats may be made from wafer mix- 
tures, and filled with cream. The Washington 
Cup No. 754 may also be served. 

For St. Patrick's Day, Pistachio Ice Cream 
frozen in harp shapes is very appropriate. 
Also Irish potatoes frozen in molds the shape 
and size of potatoes; outside, Chocolate or 
Caramel Ice Cream; centre. Vanilla Ice Cream 
with a couple of maraschino cherries, and 
served with a cream sauce. Potatoes may also 
be made from Marcipan Paste. The Cup 
Lipton may also be served, see No. 752. 

For Easter, the creams may be frozen in 
egg-shaped forms in various colors; or the 
meringue shells filled with frozen creams and 
ices. 

For the Fourth of July, the American 
Punch No. 785, or the American Cup No. 751. 



The glacfis may be served in drum-shaped cases; 
or ice cream may be frozen in brick form, in 
layers representing the American flag. Old 
Glory with the thirteen original stars and 
stripes. 

Many of the frozen creams in brick form are 
very delicious, if served with a sauce. One of 
these favorites is Vanilla Ice Cream with choco- 
late sauce; another is Bisque or Nut Ice Cream 
with maple syrup sauce. The maple sauce is 
made by reducing one pound of maple sugar 
with half a pint of water to a thick syrup. 
For cold chocolate sauce see No. 443. 

Frozen individual Fruit Creams may be 
frozen without molds, using the fruit. Remove 
the inside of solid bananas or oranges; cut the 
inside of apples and pears, leaving a thin shell. 
Place the shells in the ice cave or freezer to 
harden, then fill with frozen cream and serve. 

These creams are made still more beautiful 
if served in baskets made from ices or creams, 
or molded from nougat or meringue placed on 
another tray on which they are handed around.

Part 6. 



878.-BREADMAKING. 

To make good bread, there are three things 
required : First, good flour ; second, good 
yeast; and third, a person with practice and 
experience, who knows how to use flour and 
yeast to make bread out of it. 

Most difficulties for bakers arise from the 
variety of flours in use. Almost every section 
of this country produces flours of different 
qualities. Bakers used to Eastern flours often 
have trouble going West, and have to learn 
the use of these flours before they are able to 
make good bread. Flours of different qualities 
require more or less fermentation and different 
treatment in sponge and doughs. 

The varieties of wheat are divided into 
spring wheat and winter wheat. The winter 
wheat is planted in the fall, and the spring 
wheat in the early spring. The best grade of 
spring wheat, the hard red spring wheats, have 
come from the Northwest, from Minnesota, 
Dakota and Manitoba. The Southwest, espe- 
cially Kansas, also Texas and Oklahoma, raise 
a good hard red winter wheat which makes good 
bread flours. The winter wheats are known as 
hard and soft red winter wheat and soft white 
winter wheat. The soft grades are mostly used 
for cake and pastry flours; the others are used 
in blends with spring wheat flours. 

The Oregon and California wheats make a 
flour of good color and -flavor, but because they 
contain much starch, they are classed among 
the weak bread flours. 

It is a well known fact that winter wheat 
flours possess a better flavor, and give more 
moisture to the bread; for this reason the 
various kinds of spring and winter wheat flours 
are blended into mixtures which give a good 
flavor to the breads and at the same time a 
larger loaf. 

The mills and the large modern bakeries have 
laboratories, in which grains and flours are 
tested before milling or baking, to ascertain 
their bread-making qualities, which enables 
them to turn out a uniform blend of flour. The 
process of testing is done on a scientific basis, 
which requires a technical knowledge of chem- 
istry. The blending is done by complicated 
sifting machinery. Therefore, it is best for the 
small baker to use a standard brand of flour; 
the brand is the trademark of the miller, and 
is generally kept at a uniform quality. 

A plain test for flour, is to place several 
samples side by side on a board or stiff paper 
and smooth them with a knife as much as possi- 



ble. In this manner flour is tested for its 
freedom from bran and for color. The strong 
bread flours have a yellow color and a sharp 
granular feel when rubbed between the fingers, 
while the weaker flours are more white of color 
and feel smooth and heavy in the hand. 

Another simple test is to take even quantities 
of the different samples, say an ounce of each, 
and mix with even parts of water into a paste; 
the flour which makes the firmest paste is the 
strongest and yields the most bread. 

Even the best known brands of flour change 
with every season, and it requires constant 
watching to get uniform bread, even with the 
same brands. The most difficulties are ex- 
perienced with newly-milled flours. Bakers 
always try to keep a supply of old flour on 
hand. Newly-milled wheat flour shows less ex- 
pansion in the dough, and in baking proves 
slower than flours which have been stored and 
aired for several months. Wheat flour improves 
with age, gets whiter and of better proving 
qualities. 

Flour is best stored in a well-aired room of 
moderate temperature. It should not be kept 
near strong-smelling substances, because it ab- 
sorbs odors readily and would make the bread 
unfit for use. 

All the flours should be sifted before using. 
This makes a lighter bread and removes all 
kinds of things, like barrel tacks, strings, etc., 
etc., often found in flours. 

Graham flour is the unbolted wheat meal, but 
in many of these flours the best part of the 
flour has been taken out, or it is made of the 
poorest grades of wheat. For breadmaking it 
is best to mix some strong patent flour with it, 
to make good bread. 

Whole wheat flour, or entire wheat flour, is 
made of the better grades of wheat, with a part 
of the bran or all of it removed. 

Gluten flour, or Health flour, is used to some 
extent in sanitariums and hotels. It is a wheat 
flour which should contain very little or no 
starch at all. It is made into bread for dia- 
betic patients. 

EYE FLOUE. 

The best and whitest rye flours are made 
from the centre of the grains, like the wheat 
patent flours. Generally only the bran is taken 
from the rye flours, which makes a darker flour, 
but of a more pronounced rye flavor. Many of 
the rye flours in the market are blended with 
the darker grades of wheat flour. This is done 
partly to improve the breadmaking qualities, to 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICE5 AND SWEETMEATS. 



99 



make a larger loaf, and also to work off cheap 
■wheat flours. 

Kye meal is made like the graham flour, and 
is used for the class of rye bread called "pum- 
pernickel. ' ' 

While wheat flour improves with age, rye 
flour is better if used fresh from the mill. Old 
rye loses much of the rye flavor. 

Corn meal and corn flour is used in bread- 
making. Corn flour is generally used mixed 
with wheat flour. Tlie blended flour has the 
color and the sharp granular feel of the strong 
wheat flours, but the strength of the pure wheat 
flour is lacking. Corn meal is used in some 
breads. It is scalded and made into a mush, 
which is added to the dough. This process 
makes bread which retains moisture longer than 
the ordinary way of bread-making. Eye flour 
and corn flour blended, is also used in Europe 
to make a cheaper grade of bread. 

879.— ABOUT YEAST. 
Leaven in some form has been used for many 
thousands of years. The oldest leaven consisted 
of a piece of old dough left from the previous 
baking, and this method is still used to some ex- 
tent in Europe. 

The old dough preceded stock yeast, ferment, 
brewer's yeast and distiller's yeast. Stock yeast 
and ferment is still used by many bakers, be- 
cause they claim it makes a better bread, and 
keeps it moister. Compressed distiller's yeast 
is preferred by most of the bakers, because it is 
stronger, more uniform and reliable; not so 
readily influenced by atmospheric changes as 
the stock yeast. It is more convenient to use 
and a great saver of time and labor. 

Yeast develops best at a temparture of from 
75° to 90° Fahrenheit. Excessive heat will 
spoil yeast, kill the yeast germ; and great care 
should be taken when dissolving yeast not to 
scald it. A bake-shop should be laid out so 
as to keep an even temperature, free from 
drafts; should have a proof -box or closet where 
heat can be introduced to raise the bread and 
rolls after they are molded. The large bakeries 
pay strict attention to the temperature in bread- 
making. The temperature of the flour and 
water is taken before doughing. There are 
special doughing and proving rooms. The latest 
in this line, and also the most practical, is a 
refrigerating room to control the dough. In the 
hot summer months, when the temperature rises 
up to 90° Fahr., and more, this is of a decided 
advantage, as there is no danger of the dough 
getting too old or sour, and it enables the baker 
to turn out a uniform loaf of bread. Sudden 
changes in temperature influence yeast, and 
often are the cause of bad bread. In the winter 
time yeast works slower and more of it is re- 



quired to raise the bread. The strong flours re- 
quire more yeast, or a stronger fermentation, 
than the weak flours. Soft water raises better 
and assists the yeast, while hard water retards 
fermentation. 

Salt is used in yeast sometimes as a preserva- 
tive, and it should be put in the yeast only after 
fermentation is complete. Where yeast is 
made fresh often, salt is better left out. In 
breadmaking it is used as a flavor, and also 
as a check on fermentation. Larger quantities 
may be used in the hot season to prevent sour- 
ing. Salt should not be used in setting sponge; 
it is better if used in doughing. In the rarified 
air of high mountainous countries yeast raises 
quicker than in the low lands. 

880.— COMPEESSED YEAST. 
Compressed yeast is a by-product of distil- 
leries. Eye, corn or malt undergoes the regular 
process of fermentation necessary for the mak- 
ing of spirits. The yeast is taken from the 
tubs at a certain time, and is pressed through 
silken bags of different grades of fineness. The 
yeast so obtained goes through a chemical test 
before it is placed on the market, to keep a 
uniform article. Compressed yeast should al- 
ways be used fresh, but where it cannot be had 
regularly, it will keep for months in a jar of 
cold water ; the yeast settles on the bottom and 
the water covering prevents air spoiling the 
yeast. It is best kept in the ice box, and the 
water changed twice a week. To use it, pour 
off the water carefully, take out what is needed 
with a spoon and pour fresh water over the re- 
maining yeast. If the water gets too warm, 
the yeast will rise to the top and spoil. Yeast 
will also keep frozen for a long time. Before 
using, it should be thawed slowly in cold water. 

Compressed yeast is used for setting sponge 
and for straight doughs; also for starting stock 
yeast and potato ferment. 

881.— VIRGIN YEAST. 
MAIDEN YEAST. 
Making yeast from the beginning is not much 
practised, because the dry hop yeast cake and 
fresh compressed yeast cake can be had at al- 
most any place to start a batch of stock yeast 
with; and even the large distilleries retain 
some yeast of previous batches to start the next 
batch. It may be made on a small scale in this 
manner: Take a handful of hops and boil in 
a quart of water for half an hour; strain off 
the hops and put the liquor in a strong bottle 
with a handful of malt and a little sugar; cork 
up and tie securely with wire, and let it stand 
in a warm place for forty-eight hours. Then it 
will be ready to start about two gallons of stock 
with. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



882.— MAIDEN YEAST. 
MALT YEAST. 
Boil half a pound of hops with four gallons 
of water for one hour; cool down to 170° Fahr. 
and mash with six pounds of malt for one hour ; 
add half a pound of sugar and strain it in 
the yeast tub, a long narrow tub like an ice 
cream tub. Set this in a warm place, well cov- 
ered. Fermentation begins in one day; and 
in forty-eight hours, or when fermentation 
ceases, it is ready for use. This is a pure malt 
yeast, and a better result and a stronger yeast 
is obtained from this recipe, if stocked with 
four ounces of compressed yeast, or with one 
quart of previous stock, or eight dry hop yeast 
cakes dissolved in water. Before adding the 
yeast, the liquid should be cooled down to 80° 
Eahr. It may be got ready in from twenty-four 
to thirty-six hours, according to the strength of 
the yeast and temperature. 

883.— STOCK YEAST. 
Take five ounces of hops, two pounds of malt, 
three and one-half pounds of flour, five gal- 
lons of water, two quarts of stock yeast, or eight 
dry yeast cakes, or three ounces of compressed 
yeast. Boil the hops and water for one hour; 
strain and scald the flour with a part of the 
water into a smooth paste. Cool the hop water 
to 165° Fahr. ; add the malt, and let mash and 
cool down to 85 degrees, about blood warm. 
Strain and wash off the malt; add the flour 
paste and the stock yeast, either the liquid 
stock, or compressed yeast, or dry yeast. Put 
away in a warm place, well covered, till ready. 
If compressed yeast is used, it will be ready 
in about thirty-six hours, or sooner. When the 
yeast is ready, fermentation ceases, and the 
liquid gets clear; two ounces of salt may be 
added, and the stock put in a cold place to 
keep. It is best to make fresh stock twice a 
week. For sponge, take one quart to each pail 
of water; for ferment, take one quart to start 
four gallons of ferment. 

884.— POTATO FEEMENT. 
Peel or wash well a peck of good potatoes; 
boil till soft. Put three pounds of flour into 
the yeast tub; put the hot potatoes on the flour 
with a part of the water, and mash into a 
paste; put more water to it, to make up two 
pails (twenty quarts) ; have it about lukewarm. 
Stock away with two quarts of stock, or four 
ounces compressed yeast; cover and set aside. 
This ferment will be ready in from twelve to 
twenty-four hours, according to the tempera- 
ture. It will come up like a sponge, and fall 
when ready. It may be used to set sponge, or 
for straight doughs, with or without addition 
of more water. 

In making yeasts and ferment, the utensils 



used should be kept perfectly clean and sweet, 
to prevent contamination. 

885.— DRY YEAST CAKE. 

The dry yeast cakes are made from strong 
stock yeast, which is thickened with corn meal 
into a paste, and dried in form of small cakes, 
in which condition they keep a long time. 

They are made in the following manner : Take 
good strong stock yeast and make into a paste 
with corn meal. Eoll out one-half inch in thick- 
ness; dust with more meal and cut in one-inch 
squares. Let dry thoroughly in a warm place, 
and put away for use. This yeast works very 
slow in sponges, but if given plenty of time 
gets as strong as other yeasts. It is best to 
dissolve the dry cakes in warm water, with 
some yeast food added, which may consist of 
sugar, grape-sugar, glucose, boiled cornstarch, 
or malt. Let it stand in a warm place till it 
starts to work, and then use it in sponge, stock 
yeast, or ferment. 

886.— SALT-EISING BEEAD. 

This is also a fermented bread. The yeast 
or leaven to start with is made on the same 
principle as the Maiden Yeast No. 881. The 
making of this bread requires heat from start 
to finish. Corn meal is scalded with milk, to 
which a pinch of soda is added, into a soft 
batter; the batter is kept well covered in a 
warm place till fermentation has made it light. 
To this yeast a sponge is set with wheat flour 
(preferably winter wheat flour) and warm 
water. When this has risen again, the dough 
is made, adding more water, sugar, salt, larc 
and flour. The dough is given a little time to 
prove and is molded into loaves, proved and 
baked. This process makes a bread of good 
flavor. 

Other methods of lightening breads are by 
means of artificial aeration, and by using some 
form of baking powder. These breads lack th« 
pleasant taste of the fermented brands. They 
may be preparea quick and easy, but will never 
displace the fermented breads. 

For the aerated breads carbonic acid gas is 
used to lighten the dough. The baking powders 
are sifted with the flour, made into dough with 
the other ingredients and baked at once. 

887.— BAKING POWDEES. 
Carbonate of ammonia, cream of tartar, and 
bicarbonate of soda used to be the only lighten- 
ing agents; but many baking powders used at 
present are made of various chemicals. A good 
home-made baking powder can be made from 
two parts of bicarbonate of soda, five parts of 
cream of tartar, and one part of cornstarch. 
The starch is added to prevent caking. All 
parts are powdered and well sifted together, 
and put up in air-tight cans. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CaKES, PASTRIES, ICBS AND SWEETMEATS. 



Cream of tartar is expensive. Tartaric acid, 
phosphate and citric acid are used, which cost 
less. The cheapest grades of baking powder 
are made with powdered alum. Here are some 
recipes used:

Cornstarch, - 50 parts. 

To some of these powders one ounce of pow- 
dered turmeric is added, and they are sold as 
Egg Baking Powder. 

888.— BAKING POWDERS. 
Bicarbonate of soda and sour milk are also 
used. One teaspoonful of soda should be 
used to one pint of sour milk, but as the acidity 
of the sour milk is not always alike, less of 
the soda may be required to neutralize the same 
amount of sour milk. 

889.— SPONGE AND DOUGH. 
STEAIGHT DOUGH. 

Both of these systems are widely used. The 
sponge method is used because it enables the 
baker to make different kinds of doughs out of 
one large sponge, and it saves yeast. 

For the sponge, flour, yeast and water are 
made into a soft dough, which can be got ready 
In a shorter or longer time, by using more or 
less yeast and raising or lowering the tempera- 
ture; also, by making a slacker or tighter 
sponge: that is, to use more or less flour in 
mixing. When the sponge is made, it is al- 
lowed to rise ; when it gets ready, bubbles begin 
to show; after awhile they burst and throw off 
gas; the sponge flattens and drops in the cen- 
tre. This stage is termed by bakers the first 
drop. If not taken at this stage, it rises and 
drops again; this is termed the second drop. 
With a strong flour the fermentation will con- 
tinue in this manner till all the strength of the 
flour is exhausted and the sponge turns sour. 
Many bakers like to take the sponge at the 
second drop when using strong flours. They 
claim it makes a larger and whiter loaf. I 
prefer to take the sponge at the first drop, 
because it makes bread of better flavor. Old 
aponges rob the flour of flavor and make a 
tasteless bread. 

After the sponge is ready to the drop, from 
H may be taken for the different rolls, coffee 
cakes and breads; and more or less liquid and 
the other ingredients added, and made into the 
dough, for breads, generally one-third part of 



the flour is used in the sponge mixture, and two- 
thirds of it in the dough. A sponge may be 
set cool in the evening and taken in the morn- 
ing for doughing, or it may be set warm and 
slack, with more yeast, and got ready in one 
hour's time. 

A Straight Dough is made by mixing all the 
materials at one time. It can be made with 
ferment, or with compressed yeast. This process 
is termed the short process, and more yeast is 
used than for sponge doughs. The more yeast 
used the sooner it can be got ready. At a warm 
temperature, it can be got ready for the oven 
in four hours. At a cool temperature, with a 
smaller amount of yeast, it may also be made 
in the evening and taken in the morning. 

890.— MAKING THE DOUGH. 

DOUGHING. 

A dough should be thoroughly mixed and 
kneaded to make good bread. Small bakers are 
still mixing the doughs by hand, but all the 
larger bakeries use machinery; dough mixers 
are used ; the doughs can be made more rapidly, 
and uniform and thorough mixture is secured. 

Before molding, the doughs are given time to 
mature and get ripe. It is necessary for a 
baker to know when a dough is ready for mold- 
ing, and also when it has the proper proof to 
be baked. This point can be learned only by 
practical experience. The term ' ' proof ' ' means 
the age of the dough, which differs with the 
strength of the flour, and with the tightness of 
the doughs. When the dough gets ripe, it loses 
the green feeling and gets dry. A sponge 
dough reaches this stage sooner than a dough 
made by the straight-dough method. The 
weaker flours require a firmer dough, because 
the dough gives — gets softer after it is mada 
The strong flours give very little, and a softer 
dough can be made. In mixing the ingredients 
into the dough, it is best to add the shortening, 
butter or lard, after all the flour is added. The 
dough should be worked over several times 
after it has risen, for some time; this secures 
a close grained bread; and should be taken for 
molding when the fermentation is strongest. A 
pan bread dough may be given less age than a 
Vienna dough and rolls dough. A young dough 
takes more color in baking and requires less 
heat. Old dough can stand more heat in baking 
without taking too much color. If the tempera- 
ture of the oven is low, give the goods less 
proof than when the temperature is high, 

891.— OVENS AND BAKING HEAT. 

There are many kinds of ovens in use, and aU 
of them have some good points. The ovens 
mostly in use are the furnace brick ovens. They 
are without doubt the most practical and best 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



ovens for a small baker. They are economical 
in fuel, and burn wood as well as coal or gas. 
The only drawbacks are that the heating is 
done in the baking chamber, and nothing can 
be baked while it is heated. But these ovens 
retain the heat well, and bread, rolls, pastry 
and cakes may be baked all in one heating. 
For large bakeries, the continuous bakers are 
the most practical; the furnace is under the 
baking chamber, and the baking can be con- 
tinued during firing. The large bakers have 
specially built Vienna and other patent ovens 
for the bread and rolls, and other ovens for 
pastry and cakes. 

To bake Vienna bread and rolls and other 
hearth-baked breads, an oven is required which 
holds steam. It should have tightly fitting 
doors and dampers, and also a steam-tight oven 
light. The Vienna ovens are built to hold 
steam. They are built with a sloping hearth, 
so that the oven space is above the door. When 
the door is opened, the steam stays in the oven 
and does not escape. Other ovens have steam 
attached. The oven is filled with steam before 
the baking begins. When the bread is put into 
the oven, the steam condenses on the cooler 
dough, and in this manner forms the gloss on 
the bread. In the ordinary oven, a perforated 
steam pipe should be placed in the back of the 
oven. This brings the steam from the back to 
the front, and glazes the bread more effectually 
than when the pipe is placed in the front, as is 
often done. The steam escapes before it reaches 
the back part of the oven, when the door is 
opened to put in the bread. 

Steam can also be generated by setting an 
iron pan filled with sawdust and water in the 
oven; ora pot of water in the fire-place; or by 
rolling and tying up some bags, immersing 
them in water and laying them in one corner 
of the oven. In shelf ovens, a pan of water 
may be placed on the bottom shelf. Some 
bakers bake goods first which do not require 
steam. These goods generate enough steam to 
bake the Vienna breads and rolls. 

In Europe most all the breads are baked on 
the hearth. This gives a better flavor to the 
bread than if baked on pans or on metal oven 
soles. In this country the pan-baked breads 
predominate. 

Portable ovens are also used by many bakers 
and in the hotels. These ovens are less expen- 
sive than brick ovens, of lighter build and can 
be moved. Some of them are built after the 
style of the brick ovens, with an inside furnace 
and one baking chamber, and might be named 
movable brick ovens; others are built with 
shelves, two or three above each other. These 
ovens take up less space. 

The knowledge of the necessary heat in fur- 
nace ovens is estimated by the whiteness or 



blackness of the interior. The smoke will first 
blacken the interior, and as the heat increases 
it will clear off and become white. Practical 
bakers also can tell by holding the hand near 
the oven door or in the oven. Another test is 
to throw a handful of flour or corn meal in the 
oven; if it browns gradually, the oven is right 
for bread; if it blackens and burns, the oven 
is too hot. This knowledge can be more readily 
acquired by the use of the thermometer or pyrom- 
eter. These meters are used in every modern 
bakeshop. The baking heat is not registered all 
alike by these meters. This is caused by differ- 
ent meters, and also by placing the meter too 
near or too far from the furnace. Too much 
heat often injures these meters and they be- 
come unreliable. A few trials with the differ- 
ent meters will soon teach the right degrees for 
baking. When a furnace oven has attained the 
proper heat, the doors and dampers are closed 
and the oven is laid off. In the usual routine 
of baking, the oven is generally heated for one 
hour, let draw, and then laid off for an hour. 
The oven is then swabbed out, and the baking 
begins. Continuous ovens do not require laying 
off. The laying off is to distribute and tone 
down the heat. After the oven is shut down, 
the meter may register 550° Fahr. It will cool 
down after awhile to 500°. This heat may be 
used for rye bread; 450° for rolls and Vienna; 
400° for pies and pastry; 300° to 200° for 
large cake, etc. Some ovens may be right for 
bread at 350°, and so on, according to the 
nearness of the furnace. Some ovens have too 
strong a bottom heat. This requires more swab- 
bing, and often necessitates the use of double 
pans to prevent burning the bottom of the 
goods. The baking should be so arranged, and 
the goods got ready for baking so that the 
goods which require the most heat are baked 
first, followed by the others which require less 
heat in baking. 

892.— MILK IN DOUGH MIXTXJEES. 

Milk makes a very palatable and nutritious 
bread. Many bakers object to the use of mUk, 
because it is apt to turn the bread sour. It is 
best to sterilize the milk: that is, to heat it to 
the boiling point, and then cool it down to the 
proper temperature for doughing. 

When using all milk, it is best to make a 
straight dough. When only a part milk is used, 
set sponge with water, and use the milk for 
doughing. Milk which is beginning to turn 
sour can be used without danger to the sponge, 
by adding one teaspoonful of baking soda to 
each gallon of milk. Sour milk if put on the 
sponge will cause it to ferment more rapidly, 
and ages the dough in a shorter time, but 
should not be used with yeast to set sponge. 
Milk breads take more color in baking, require

a lower temperature in baking, and, conse- 
quently, less proof. 

893.— THE BAKESHOP. 

Modern bakers do no guessing in their work. 
They ascertain the temperature of the shop and 
flour, and give the water the proper temperature 
to obtain a dough of a certain degree of heat. 
If the shop is kept at an even temperature, by 
heating or ventilation, the doughs can be got 
ready at a certain time for baking; bread- 
making is made more certain, and better bread 
results. The appliances should be located in 
the handiest position to make work easy, and 
the materials in the right place. There are 
many labor-saving devices, which, when used, 
often save one hand in the shop and soon pay 
for themselves. A well-constructed shop, pro- 
vided with the proper appliances and utensUs, 
makes work a pleasure and assists in doing good 
work. It also tends to retain good help, and 
prevents frequent changes, which is often the 
case when the appliances are not satisfactory. 

894.— FEENCH BEEADS. 

It is usage in many bakeries to make French, 
Vienna, and the ordinary pan breads all out of 
one dough, the only difference in the breads 
being in the name and shape. The fancy 
breads of Paris, the Pain du Luxe, is made 
after the Vienna method — ^raised with com- 
pressed yeast or stock yeast and short sponges. 
The original French bread is an all-water 
bread. The bread is not as white as the Amer- 
ican breads — more of a yellowish color. The 
body of the bread is light and moist, and of 
a slight sourish taste, but good to eat. This 
bread is raised with" leaven. The leaven con- 
sists of a piece of dough, about three or four 
pounds, left from the day before; this is 
thinned up with three quarts of warm water 
and made into a soft sponge with more flour. 
This sponge is ready to drop in about two 
hours ; with six more quarts of water this is 
made into the second sponge. When this is 
ripe, from twelve to twenty-four quarts of 
water is added, with the usuai amount of salt; 
the sponge is broken fine and worked into a 
smooth dough with more flour. One-third of 
this dough is put aside to serve as the second 
sponge for the next batch of bread. 

The other dough is given a start, is scaled 
right out of the trough, molded into loaves at 
once, put in long cloth-lined baskets, the shape 
of the loaf, and given three-quarter proof. The 
oven, which has been heated during this process, 
is swabbed out. The loaf is turned upside down 
onto the peel, given three or four slanting cuts, 
put into the oven on the hearth and baked to a 
nice brown color. 



895.— NEW YOEK FEENCH BEEADS. 

In New York City the French bakers make 
several kinds : the long loaves, Jocos, which are 
more than two feet long, and the split loaves, 
about eighteen inches long. Some of the bakers 
use stock yeast and ferment; others make fer- 
ment only, and stock it with compressed yeast; 
a few make straight doughs. At Delmonico's, 
the famous caterers, they use stock yeast and 
ferment ; set sponge with the ferment, and make 
dough from the sponge. Nothing else but 
water, flour and salt goes into the bread. 

896.— THE NEW YOEK EECIPE. 
Set a medium Sponge with one gallon fer- 
ment at 75° Fahr. This sponge will be ready 
to drop in three hours. When ready, add one 
gallon of water at the same temperature and 
six ounces of salt. Make a good dough; beat 
it well, but have it rather slack; pen up in the 
trough and let rest for one hour; scale and 
mold round into a box, and when all have been 
scaled begin to mold into long loaves. Set the 
loaves in cloth-lined boxes, dust lightly with 
flour and pinch up the cloth between. When 
proved, put onto the peel, wash with water and 
give four or five outs, and put into the oven on 
the hearth. When baked, wash again with 
water. 

897.— FEENCH SPLIT LOAVES. 
Use the same dough as for the long loaves; 
best if a little firmer. Scale and mold in the 
box; then form in long loaves of the Vienna 
shape, and set these on the board or bench. 
When they are all molded and have proved 
slightly, dust with flour (some bakers brush 
the top of the loaves with lard), and press each 
loaf along the center with a long narrow rolling 
pin, just like the split rolls. Set the loaves 
split-side down in cloth-lined boxes, pinch up 
the cloth between, and let prove. Turn split- 
side up onto the peel, put in the oven and bake 
on the hearth (without washing), to a nice 
color. 

898.— CHICAGO FEENCH BEEAD. 
Set a sponge as usual, with one gallon of 
water and two ounces of yeast at 75° Fahr. 
Use a good patent flour. When ready, add one 
gallon of water, four ounces of sugar, and six 
ounces of salt, and make a good smooth dough. 
Let come up and work over; give a little time 
to recover; then scale and proceed like for the 
New York bread. The breads may be baked 
in steam, like the Vienna, or without steam, 
washing the loaves before and after baking. 

899.— KINSLEY'S FEENCH SPLIT BEEAD. 
2 gallons water, 1 gallon milk, 4 ozs. yeast, 
4 ozs. sugar, 8 ozs. salt, 8 ozs. lard. 

Set a sponge as usual with water and yeast. 



I04 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, 



Take the sponge as soon as it is ready; make a 
dough with the milk, sugar and salt; add the 
lard after the flour, and make a, nice smooth 
dough. Work over twice, and proceed like for 
the other split loaves. (See No. 897.) 

900.— VIENNA BEEADS. 
The Vienna method of breadmaking is used 
by many bakers. A strong flour of good flavor 
is used, with light short sponges, and plenty of 
good strong yeast; both sponge and dough are 
treated cool and taken young. Most all of the 
breads are hearth baked, crisp, and with a good 
crust. When the breads and rolls are molded 
and have nearly attained proof, they are set in 
a cooler place. They stiffen up, but are kept 
free from drafts. Then they are baked in 
steam. (See Ovens No. 891.) 

901.— GENUINE VIENNA BREAD. 

1 gal. water, 5 ozs. yeast, 1 gal. milk, 6 ozs. salt. 
Set a very slack sponge at 70 degrees Fahr. 

When ready, add the milk and salt at the same 
temperature, and make a medium dough. Use 
the best spring flour. Let rest for one hour and 
work down; let come up again about half, and 
work over again; let it come up again, and 
make into breads or rolls. 

902.— AMERICAN VIENNA BEEAD WITH 
SPONGE. 

2 gallons water, 1 gallon milk, 4 ozs. yeast, 
6 ozs. salt, 8 ozs. sugar, 8 ozs. lard. 

Before setting the sponge, dissolve the yeast 
in the pail with one pint of water at 85 degrees 
Fahr.; add some flour to make a soft batter; 
beat up well and set aside in a warm place for 
twenty minutes. Add to this batter the rest of 
the two gallons of water at 75 degrees Fahr., 
and with more flour make a slack sponge. When 
it falls in the centre, add milk and the other 
ingredients and make a medium firm dough. 
Let the dough double in size, and work over; 
let come up, and work over again. Scale and 
mold into loaves. 

Set in cloth-lined boxes, smooth-side down; 
pinch up the cloth between and keep well cov- 
ered during proving. Give good three-quarter 
proof, turn onto the peel by means of a thin 
board, smooth-side up, give three slanting cuts 
and bake on the hearth. 

If the oven holds steam, no washing is re- 
quired; but if baked without steam, it is cut 
and washed with water before it goes into the 
oven, and washed again with a thin cornstarch 
wash, when it is baked. 

If a thin egg-wash is used going into the 
oven, no washing is required after baking. 



PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 

903.— VIENNA BEEAD. STRAIGHT 
DOUGH. 
1% gallon water, % gallon milk, 6 ozs. salt, 12 
ozs. sugar, 12 ozs. lard, 4 ozs. compressed yeast. 
Make a dough with all the ingredients at 80 
to 85 degrees Fahr. Let rest for four hours 
and work down; let come up, and work over 
once more; let it get another start and mold 
into loaves. 

904.— VIENNA CREAM BREADS. 

Take from doughs No. 902 or No. 903. When 
ready to mold, scale into twenty-four-ounce 
loaves; mold and put in round corrugated pans 
of four inches in diameter, from ten to twelve 
inches long; give three-quarter proof, and bake 
in medium heat. 

This makes nice round slices for sandwiches, 
which require no trimming. 

905.— MILK BREAD. 

1 gallon water, 1 gallon milk, 4 ozs. yeast, 
8 ozs. sugar, 12 ozs. lard, 5 ozs. salt. 

Make a straight dough, as usual; or set a 
sponge with the water and yeast at 75 degrees 
Fahr. When it falls in the centre make the 
dough, adding milk, sugar, salt and lard. Work 
over twice, give another start and mold into 
loaves. Set in pans with sliding cover, or set 
the loaves with the smooth side up on flat bak- 
ing pans some distance apart, and cover with 
the regular baking tins. The loaves may be cut 
crosswise or in ribs, or proved up plain, without 
cutting. Give the loaves three-quarters proof, 
and bake in medium heat. If more color is 
required, the tins may be taken off when almost 
done and the baking finished without them. 
906.— PULLMAN BEEAD. 

This bread is used to a large extent on the 
dining cars, and at many depots for sandwiches. 
The Pullman pans are made in single and dou- 
ble pans, with sliding covers. The size of the 
pans ten inches long and four and one-half 
inches square. This size of pan makes a large 
square slice of bread which is especially suited 
for sandwiches. 

A good Vienna or Milk Bread dough may be 
used for this bread. The dough should be 
medium firm and go through the rollers from 
ten to twelve times before molding. 

Bakers who have no machinery, use hand- 
rollers, which are not very expensive. They can 
be fastened to the bench with clamps, and can 
be taken off after using. The rolling makes 
this bread close and fine grained. Make and 
bake like the Milk Bread No. 905. 

907.— COLUMBIA BEEAD. 

2 gallons water, 6 ozs. yeast, 7 ozs. salt, 

12 ozs. sugar, 1 lb. lard. 
Set a firm sponge with two-thirds of the 
water and a strong flour. Let the sponge come 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS.

up twice and fall; take it at the second drop. 
Add the rest of the water and the other ingre- 
dients; make a firm dough (best with winter 
wheat flour). Let rest for fifteen minutes; then 
run through the rollers twenty times. Scale and 
mold at once in the usual baking tins; cut over 
five times, let prove up moist, give three-quarter 
proof, and bake in steam in a solid heat. 

This bread became well known during the 
Columbian Exposition. The old treatment of 
the sponge bleaches the flour, and the rolling 
gives a very fine white texture and grain, but 
of little flavor. 

908.— SNOWFLAKE BREAD. 

This bread is practically the same as the 

Columbia No. 907, and can be made from the 

recipe; only set a slack sponge, give it the 

second drop, make the dough only medium firm. 

Boll, scale, mold and bake in the same manner. 

909.— SNOWFLAKE BREAD WITH 

BUTTERMILK. 

1 gallon water, 1 gallon buttermilk, 2 ozs. yeast, 

5 ozs. sugar, 6 ozs. salt, 6 ozs. lard. 

Set a medium firm sponge with water and 

yeast. Take the sponge when ready; add milk, 

sugar, salt and lard and make a medium dough. 

Let come up, and run through the break or 

rollers twelve times. Scale and mold in the 

square box mold, or bake under cover, like the 

Milk Bread No. 905. 

910.— HOME MADE BREADS. 
These breads are made mostly by the straight- 
dough method, raised either with ferment or 
compressed yeast. Some bakers add cornmeal 
in form of mush, or boiled rice. The doughs 
are set to rise in the evening, and taken in the 
morning. Some of the modern bakers in place 
of using stock yeast and ferment, use malt ex- 
tract, potato fiour boiled into starch, or add 
mashed potatoes to the doughs. This process 
keeps the bread moist and adds flavor. A home 
made bread should be close grained and of a 
solid texture, which is best obtained by making 
a medium firm dough. Work it well, and do 
not give full proof in baking. 

911.— HOME MADE BREAD WITH FER- 
MENT. 
6 quarts of ferment, 2 quarts water or milk, 
5 ozs. salt. 
Make a straight dough with the ingredients; 
set at 75 to 80 degrees Fahr. Work the dough 
well and pen it close up in the trough; let come 
up, and work over ; let come up half, then throw 
out; scale, mold in the box and form in loaves. 
Sugar and lard may be added to this mixture. 
It may also be made into French bread or rolls. 



912.— HOME MADE BREAD WITH COM- 
PRESSED YEAST. 
2 gallons water, 2 ozs. yeast, 6 ozs. salt, 
6 ozs. sugar, 6 ozs. lard. 

Make a straight dough in the evening at 75 
degrees Pahr., using a good strong flour. This 
dough will be ready in from eight to nine hours. 
It will flatten out like a sponge when ready — 
lose its resistance. Work this dough over well 
and let come on for twenty minutes. Scale, 
mold and pan as usual. 

The same recipe may be got ready in about 
four hours with four to six ounces of yeast, at a 
warmer temperature; and it can be made to 
come slow or fast, using more or less yeast. 

913.— NEW ENGLAND BREAD WITH 

SPONGE. 

2 gallons water, 2 ozs. yeast, 6 ozs. salt, 

6 ozs. sugar, 4 ozs. lard. 

Set sponge with six quarts of water at 75 

degrees Fahr. Scald twenty ounces of cornmeal 

(white) into a soft mush. When the sponge is 

ready, thin up the cornmeal with two quarts of 

water; rub it through a sieve onto the sponge; 

add sugar, salt and lard, and make a medium 

dough. Let come up, work over, scale and mold 

into loaves. Give only three-quarter proof, and 

bake in a good heat. 

914.— NEW ENGLAND BREAD, STRAIGHT 
DOUGH. 

To the recipes No. 911 or No. 912 add four 
pounds of cornmeal mush, or take twenty ounces 
of white cornmeal and make it into mush and 
add it to the dough. Treat like No. 913. 
915.— QUAKER BREAD. 

Some bakers use corn-flour dry; others, corn- 
meal mush; some add malt extracts or glucose; 
others again, sugar and lard only, in this bread. 
Malt extracts improve the flavor of the bread; 
it is used in proportion of one and one-half 
ounces to one gallon of liquid. The breads are 
mostly made with a short straight dough. 
915-A.^CHICAGO QUAKER BREAD. 

Take one pail of ferment (ten quarts) ; or, 
take one pail of water and five ounces of com- 
pressed yeast, eight ounces of sugar, or eight 
ounces of glucose, two pounds of cornmeal 
mush, six ounces of salt, and eight ounces of 
lard. 

Before doughing, dissolve the yeast in one 
pint of warm water, add the glucose and some 
flour to make a soft batter. Let this stand in 
a warm place for twenty minutes. 

[This process is to strengthen the yeast and 
to secure a lively fermentation. It may be used 
also in other doughs.] 

Add the water at 80 degrees Fahr., and make

a smooth dough with the other ingredients. Let 
rest for four hours and work over; let rise 
again about half and make into loaves. Bake 
in double square pans, give medium proof and 
bake in good heat. 

916.— MOTHEE'S BEBAD. 

1 pail water, 1 lb. sugar, 1 lb. lard, 5 ozs. yeast, 

6 ozs. salt. 

Make a straight dough and bake in double- 
square loaves, like the Quaker Bread No. 915. 
Part milk may be used in this recipe. 
917.— MALT BEEAD. 

Take recipe No. 916, leave out the sugar, and 
add six ounces of malt extract and one pound 
of dry corn-flour, or two pounds of cornmeal 
mush. Make a straight dough at 75 to 80 de- 
grees Pahr. Take the dough young; give only 
good half proof in baking, and bake in steam. 

918.— POTATO BEEAD. 
% peck potatoes, 5 quarts milk, 5 quarts water, 
4 ozs. yeast, 8 ozs. sugar, 8 ozs. salt, 8 ozs. lard. 

Set a slack sponge with the water, yeast, and 
a strong flour. Boil, peel and mash the pota- 
toes. When the sponge is ready, thin up the 
potatoes with the milk and pass them through 
a sieve onto the sponge, add the other ingre- 
dients and make a medium firm dough. Let 
come up and work over; give a start and then 
mold in loaves. Give only medium proof, and 
bake as usual. 

This bread is also made as a hearth-baked 
bread in the following manner: When the 
dough is ready to mold, scale and mold round; 
flatten the loaves some and set in boxes dusted 
with flour, smooth side up, a little distance 
apart, so they do not touch in proving; dust 
some flour on top of the loaves, cover and give 
three-quarter proof. Bake on the hearth with- 
out washing. 

919.— ENGLISH COTTAGE BEEAD. 

NEW YOEK HIGH-ROUND BEEAD. 
lEISH SPLIT LOAVES. 
1 gallon ferment, 1 gallon water, 6 ozs. salt, 
6 ozs. sugar, 6 ozs. lard. 

Set sponge with the ferment ; take the sponge 
when ready, add water and other ingredients 
and make a firm dough. Let come up and work 
over, scale in eight-ounce pieces and mold round 
on the bench; then mold over again and press 
two pieces together on top of ea«h other; dust 
with flour and set two by two in long narrow 
cloth-lined boxes, pinch up the cloth between 
each two and let prove. 

The oven is lined on the sides with wood. The 
bread is put in, two loaves at one time, close 
together in square shape. This requires prac-

tice and dexterity. When the loaves are all in 
the oven, other pieces of wood are put in front 
of it to keep it in shape till baked. 

Split loaves are made from the same dough, 
named IRISH SPLIT. They are first molded 
in, the shape of pan loaves ; then pressed along 
the centre, like the Prench split; set to prove, 
split side down, between cloths. The loaves are 
baked like the Cottage loaves, ends and sides 
touching each other. 

920.— CHICAGO lEISH BREAD. 

Make a good home-made dough like No. 910 
or No. 911. Mold in one-pound loaves, the 
shape of pan loaves; set in cloth-lined boxes, 
smooth side down, two-by-two, so they touch; 
pinch up the cloth between, and let prove. To 
bake; put the loaves in the oven, two at one 
time, in one row, so they touch the other loaves 
at the ends, but not at the sides. Bake without 
washing. 

921.— GRAHAM BREAD; Straight Dough. 

2 gallons water, 3 ozs. yeast, 1% pint molasses, 

6 ozs. salt, 8 ozs. lard. 

Make a straight dough with the ingredients, 
rather slack; use one-third to one-half of wheat 
flour with the graham flour. Let come up once, 
work over; scale, mold and pan. (Do not give 
much proof.) Bake in medium heat. Always 
treat the dough cool and take it young. 
922.— GRAHAM BEBAD PROM SPONGE. 

Take two gallons of broken-up white bread 
sponge, with the salt in it; add one and one- 
half pints of molasses, eight ounces of lard, 
and make the dough with one part wheat flour 
and two parts of graham flour. Prove and 
bake like No. 921. 

923.— WHOLE WHEAT BREAD. 
GLUTEN BEEAD. 
HEALTH BEEADS. 

The Whole Wheat Breads, Entire Wheat 
Breads, and also the Gluten Breads, or Health 
Breads, as they are often called, are made and 
baked like the Graham Bread; less sweetening 
is used, and in some instances, when used for 
dietetic purposes, both sweetening and shorten- 
ing are left out altogether. The breads are 
made of water, or partly milk. 

Take one gallon of water, one gallon of milk, 
three ounces of yeast, six ounces of salt, twelve 
ounces of lard, three-quarters pint of molasses. 

Good flours of this kind require no addition 
of wheat flour, and are used straight; some of 
them are very poor, and bake better with some 
strong spring wheat flour added. Make the 
dough like for Graham Bread; treat cool, take 
the dough young and do not give much proof 
in baking.

924.— WHOLE WHEAT BREAD WITH 

POTATOES. 

2 quarts milk, 2 quarts water, 2 ozs. yeast, 

2 ozs. salt, 8 ozs. sugar, 8 ozs. lard, 

1 lb. of boiled and mashed potatoes. 

Grate or mash the boiled potatoes. Use the 
water the potatoes are boiled in with the two 
quarts of milk to make up one gallon. With 
the yeast and other ingredients make a soft 
dough, and work smooth. Mold and bake like 
No. 923. The loaves may be washed with water 
after baking, or brushed with butter or lard. 

925.— ELECTEIC BEOWN BEEAD. 
12 lbs. graham flour, 12 lbs. wheat flour, 
1 gallon milk, 1 gallon water, 

1 quart molasses, 1% lbs. lard, 

1 oz. baking soda, 1 lb. baking powder, 

8 ozs. salt. 
Less of the baking powder may be needed, or 
the soda left out, if a strong powder is used 
and the bread is too light. Eub the lard in a 
part of the flour; sift the baking powder in 
the other part; mix both together; form a bay 
in the centre of the flour. Dissolve the soda 
in the milk, add salt and molasses and make a 
nice smooth dough, rather slack. Scale and pan 
at once, set in a warm prover, let come up half, 
and bake in medium heat. Brush over with 
water or lard after baking. 

926.— BOSTON BEOWN BEEAD. 

This bread is raised with yeast; also with 
soda, or with baking powder. More or less 
molasses may be used to make different qual- 
ities. Lard or shortening is not used in this 
bread. In hotels or restaurants the pudding 
steamer is used to steam it, but it can also be 
baked in a cool oven at a temperature of 200 
to 250 degrees Fahr. 

To bake: set the molds in a pan with about 
two inches of water in it, which steam-bakes the 
bread, and prevents too much browning at the 
bottom. 

Self-raising, ready-made brown bread flours 
are in the market, which have to be mixed with 
even quantities of milk or water and molasses 
into a soft batter, and steamed as usual. 

927.— BOSTON BEOWN BEEAD; YEAST 

EAISED. 
2 lbs. rye flour, 2 ozs. yeast, 

2 lbs. eornmeal, 1 quart molasses, 

2 lbs. graham flour, 2 ozs. salt, 

2 lbs. wheat flour. 
Make a sponge vrith the yeast and rye flour, 
using warm water. Scald the eornmeal with 
one quart boiling water, and let cool. When the 
sponge is ready, add molasses and salt, corn- 
meal mush and the other flours, and mix with 



milk into a smooth dough. When it shows life, 
divide into loaves and fill into well-greased 
molds. This mixture makes about one dozen 
loaves. Let rise to three-quarter proof, and 
steam or bake for three hours. 

928.— BOSTON BEOWN BEEAD with SODA. 
1 lb. rye flour, 1 quart molasses, 

1 lb. graham flour, 3 pints milk, 

2 lbs. eornmeal, 2 ozs. salt, 

1 lb. wheat flour, 1 oz. baking soda. 

Mix all the flours together, dissolve the soda 
in the milk; add salt and molasses, and make 
a slack dough, same as for drop cakes, adding 
more milk if required. Pill molds about three- 
quarters full. Steam or bake for three hours. 

Three ounces of baking powder may be used 
in place of the soda. 

Eaisins and currants are used for variety in 
the brown breads, also a small addition of 
spices, and stale cake crumbs may be used up 
in the breads. 

929.— SALT-EISING BEEAD. 

This bread is made of winter wheat flour, 
not of bread flour. Take half a cupful of corn- 
meal and half, a teaspoonful of soda; scald 
with three eupfuls of fresh milk, and make a 
very thin mush; add a pinch of salt and a lit- 
tle sugar. Set in a warm place over night, at an 
even temperature of 85 to 90 degrees Fahr., and 
keep well covered. In twelve hours this yeagt 
will be light. Mix two quarts of warm water 
and two pounds of flour at 95 degrees Fahr., 
and add the yeast. This sponge will be ready 
in about one hour; add one more quart of 
water, two ounces of sugar and two of salt, a 
little lard, and with more flour make a medium 
firm dough. Scale and mold into loaves, put 
in pans, give about one-half proof, and bake 
like other breads. 

A very warm temperature is required from 
the beginning to the finish, to make this bread 
successfully. 

930.— TO MAKE VARIOUS KINDS OF 
BEEADS FEOM ONE LAEGE SPONGE. 
Set a medium sponge with four gallons of 
water, six to eight ounces of yeast, with a good 
flour, at a warm temperature of about 80 de- 
grees Fahr. This sponge will have a good 
drop in three hours. (This same sponge may 
be set at a cooler temperature and less yeast, 
for a long sponge.) One quart of liquid makes 
about five pounds of sponge dough. 

Take from the ready sponge ten pounds for

give only medium proof and bake as explained 
in No. 931. 

When putting the bread in the oven, don't 
set the loaves too close together, till they are 
baked up well; then move closer together and 
finish baking. 

Bakers using shelf ovens without tile bot- 
toms, can set the bread on roll pans dusted with 
a mixture of flour and cornmeal, and bake it. 

934.— RYE BBEAD WITH SPONGE. 

2 gallons water, 2 lbs. rye dough, 1 oz. yeast, 

6 ozs. salt, % oz. caraway seed. 

Set sponge at about 65 degrees Fahr., with 
one gallon of water, yeast and rye dough. Use 
the same proportions of flour as in No. 933. 
When the sponge is ready, add water and salt, 
and make the dough. 

There are some people who do not like cara- 
way seed; for this reason some bakers add it 
only to a part of the dough, or add it during 
the molding process. This gives a choice to the 
consumer. 

935.— HALF EYE BREAD. 

The Half Eye Bread is generally made from 
a wheat flour sponge, without adding any sour 
dough, but the flavor is improved if sour dough 
is added. 

2 gallons water, 2 ozs. yeast, ^ oz. caraway 
seed, 6 ozs. salt. 

Set sponge with one gallon of water, the 
yeast and wheat flour. When ready, add one 
gallon of water and the salt, also the caraway 
seed, and make a medium firm dough, with one 
part wheat flour and two parts rye flour. The 
bread is molded in the shape of the Vienna 
loaves, and is given more proof than the other 
rye breads. 

936.— PUMPERNICKEL. 

The coarse rye bread known here under this 
name, is made from the unbolted rye meal. The 
stone-milled meal makes a better bread than 
the meal made by the roller process. It is 
baked on the hearth in brick-shape, set close 
together, like the cottage loaves and split 
loaves (see No. 919). In Germany it is made 
in large and small loaves. In Westphalia, the 
home of the Pumpernickel, it is made in loaves 
as large as twenty-five pounds. In other parts 
of Germany, the five- and ten-pound loaves pre- 
vail. In this country it is made in two-pound 
loaves. 

In North Germany this bread goes through 
the process of CASSELING. After it is 
molded, the loaves are washed with water and 
put on the cassel, a long piece of sheet iron, 
six feet long, eight inches wide, and one-fourth 
of an inch thick, with a wooden handle. The 
ovens are heated on the inside, the coals are 
drawn to the front and divided into two long 
heaps about two feet apart. The cassel is 



pushed between the two fires. When it reaches 
a certain degree of heat, it is puUed out, the 
molded loaves are put on, washed again and 
pushed into the oven. The heat forms a thin 
elastic skin and little blisters; then the loaves 
are withdrawn, taken off, set on boards and 
finished proving. This treatment keeps the 
loaves in shape, prevents bursting, and gives 
a lighter color to the crust, and also a different 
taste to the baked loaf. This treatment is not 
practiced over here, to my knowledge, because 
it is too troublesome. Bakers generally mold 
the bread, give it about half proof, wash and 
bake it like the other rye breads, only set it 
close together in brick shape. 

To make this bread on a small scale: Take 
half a gallon of broken wheat sponge, half a 
gallon of water, one pound of sour dough, three 
ounces of salt, one-half ounce of caraway 
seed, and make a firm dough with rye meal. 
Let the dough rest till it shows life. Mold in 
two-pound loaves, set on boards, give about 
half proof, wash with water, and bake as de- 
scribed above. The loaves may also be set in a 
baking pan with a wooden frame in it, and 
baked in this manner. 

937.— FRENCH BOLLS. 
FLUTES. 

This roll is used largely as a dinner roll. It 
is made in the shape of a small French loaf, 
and weighs about three ounces. The roll is 
made long with pointed ends, given several 
cuts, and baked on the hearth and in steam. 

Take from the French bread doughs No. 896 
or No. 898; break up in small pieces and mold 
round on the board; give some proof and mold 
in long shape. Set in cloth-lined boxes, in rows, 
the smooth side down, pinch up the cloth be- 
tween, and let prove. Then turn onto the peel 
smooth-side up, cut, and bake in steam. 

The rolls may be baked without steam, and 
set on pans dusted with cornmeal and flour, cut 
and washed before and after baking. 

938.— FRENCH SPLIT ROLLS. 
Use the same dough as for Flutes ; or use No. 
899, which makes a roll with a shorter crust. 
Divide in two-ounce pieces (for hotel use they 
may be made smaller), mold round on the 
board, give some proof, and brush over with 
melted lard; then with a small rolling pin 
press along the centre, turn over and set on 
cloths, split-side down. Give good proof, turn 
over onto the peel, split-side up, and bake on 
the hearth. 

939.— FEENCH BEIOCHE. 

1 pint milk, 2 ozs. yeast, 8 to 12 eggs, 1 oz. 

sugar, 1 lb. butter (from which the salt has 

been washed), a pinch of salt. 

Set a warm sponge with the milk and yeast; 

use a strong flour. When this sponge is ready, 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



add eggs, sugar and salt and work in the flour; 
then add the butter and make a smooth dough. 
Let rise, and work over several times; then set 
in a cool place to stiffen up. After it has 
cooled and become firmer, it is ready to be 
molded in different shapes. 

The regular Brioches are molded in the shape 
of the cottage loaf, a large flat round bottom 
and a small top. In this shape it is proved and 
given some straight cuts all around the sides. 

Many other fancy shapes are made from this 
dough: small fingers, twists, crescents, etc., etc. 
These rolls are baked on pans, and washed with 
egg-wash before baking. 

940.— VIENNA ROLL. 

KAISERSEMMEL. 

EMPEEOB'S ROLL. 
The best known Vienna Bolls are the Kaiser- 
semmel, or Emperor's Boll, and the Kipfl, or 
Crescent. Many other varieties are made, as 
Twists, Split Bolls, etc., etc. At Vienna sev- 
eral qualities are made: Water Bolls, Milk 
Bolls, and rolls which contain shortening. Most 
all the roUs are baked on the hearth. Only the 
rolls with shortening are baked on pans. The 
baking on the hearth and in steam, and the 
cool treatments, is what gives these rolls the 
excellent taste which has made them famous the 
world over. 

The making of the rolls requires long prac- 
tise, and if baked and made right cannot be 
excelled by any other breads. In the American 
mixtures sugar and lard is used, like in the 
Vienna breads, and the bread mixtures from 
No. 903 to No. 905 may be used for rolls with 
a firmer dough. 

941.— VIENNA MILK BOLLS. 

1 gallon water, 1 gallon milk, 5 ozs. salt, 

from 4 to 6 ozs. compressed yeast. 
Set a sponge with water and yeast as usual. 
When it falls in the centre, add the milk and 
salt and make a medium dough with a good 
spring flour. Let come up well the first time; 
work over and let come again; then break up 
in pieces and make into rolls. More milk may 
be used in this mixture, and also a larger 
amount of yeast. This dough is best suited 
for all kinds of Vienna rolls. 

942.— VIENNA BOLLS with SHOBTENING. 
Add to the dough above (best if it is made 
from all mUk), after all the flour is worked in, 
one pound and four ounces of butter. The 
butter should be melted, drawn off and set in 
a cold place to harden. If added to the cool 
dough, the rolls have a nice leafy crust when 
baked. 

' 943.— AMEBICAN VIENNA BOLLS, 
STRAIGHT DOUGH. 

2 quarts milk, 2 quarts water, 4 ozs. yeast, 
4 ozs. sugar, 12 ozs. lard, 3 ozs. salt. 

Make a medium firm dough with the ingre- 



dients. Let the dough come up and work over 
twice; then it is ready to form into rolls. The 
rolls are baked on pans, and can be baked with- 
out steam, if an egg-wash is applied before 
baking. 

944.— VIENNA BRIOCHES. 

The Vienna Brioches are not made as rich as 
the French kind, but make a nice roll. It is 
made in many fancy shapes, like twists, snails, 
knots, small crescents, etc. A small round roll 
is made with sultana raisins. The rolls are 
baked on pans, and washed with eggs before 
baking. 

Take one pint of milk, two ounces of yeast, 
one ounce of sugar, a pinch of salt, eight 
ounces of butter, and four eggs. 

Make a light sponge with milk and yeast. 
When ready, add the beaten eggs, sugar and 
salt; add the flour, and last, the butter. Make 
a medium dough, let come up and work over, 
and set in a cool place for one hour to get firm. 
Then it is ready to form the different shapes. 
Give good proof and bake to a nice golden 
color. 

945.— HAMBURG RUNDSTUCK. 
GERMAN BRODCHEN. 
HAMBURG ROLLS. 
1 gallon milk, 8 ozs. yeast, 2% ozs. salt. 

The method used in Hamburg is to make a 
slack straight dough with the ingredients, using 
a good patent flour. Set to raise in a warm 
place for half an hour; then throw out on the 
table, dust well with flour and work over in 
small pieces of not more than one pound, and 
put back in box or bowl to prove. The dough 
should be worked over in this manner from 
four to five times every half hour. In a warm 
place, this dough should then be full of life and 
ready to mold into rolls. 

Break in two ounce pieces, mold in long ovals 
and set in dusted boxes or on floured cloths; 
let prove. Then set on the peel, give a deep cut 
across, and bake on the hearth and in steam. 

Another way of making these rolls is to use a 
slack Vienna dough. Mold the rolls in ovals 
and set on pans dusted with flour and cornmeal, 
set to prove in a moist prover; give half proof, 
cut across, and set back to finish proving, and 
bake in steam. 

If baked without steam, they should be 
washed with water before baking, and with a 
thin cornstarch wash when done. 

946.— GERMAN WATER ROLL. 
(SEMMEL.) 
These roUs are made from sponge dough, and 
any of the doughs used for the French or 
Vienna breads may be used. Take from the 
dough and break in one ounce pieces, mold 
round and set on board to give a little proof; 
take two pieces and press lightly together, set

947.— GERMAN BUTTER BOUi. 
SPLIT ROLL. 
6 quarts milk, 6 ozs. yeast, 4 ozs. sugar, 4 ozs. 
salt, 3 lbs. butter and lard. 

Set a very soft sponge with half of the liquid 
and yeast. When the sponge is ready, add the 
salt, sugar and flour, and, last, the lard. Work 
the dough well and let rest for one hour; work 
over twice and mold round in two-ounce pieces; 
set in cloth-lined boxes and mold like the Ham- 
burg roll (No. 945). When ready for the oven, 
in place of cutting across, cut lengthwise, not 
very deep, and bake in steam. 

The same mixture is made into split rolls, 
like the French split roll (see No. 938), and 
baked in the same manner. 

948.— AMERICAN ROLLS. 
ALBANY ROLL. 
All the Vienna and French rolls are made by 
the American bakers, but generally richer and 
with a softer and more brittle crust. The 
American roll, which has many names, is known 
as the PARKER HOUSE ROLL, the ALBANY 
BOLL, the POCKET-BOOK ROLL, etc., and 
is made after a variety of recipes. The rolls 
can be made by the sponge method, or with a 
straight dough. 

949.— PARKER HOUSE ROLL. No. 1. 
2 quarts milk, 2 quarts water, 3 ozs. yeast, 
1 oz. salt, 1 lb. butter, 10 ozs. sugar. 

950.— PARKER HOUSE ROLL. No. 2. 

1 gallon milk, 4 ozs. yeast, six ozs. sugar, 2 ozs. 

salt, 12 ozs. butter or lard. 

Make both mixtures either with a sponge, 
using half the liquid in the sponge, or make a 
straight dough. When ready, mold round on 
the board and give a little proof; then take a. 
small pin and roll flat in the centre; take some 
melted butter or lard and brush over; double 
both sides together and set on pans; they may 
be set close, to touch in baking, or single. The 
rolls should not be given too much proof. In 
baking they should open and eurl backwards, if 
given the right proof. If proved moist, they 
require no washing, but may be brushed with 
butter or lard when done. 

951.— POCKET-BOOK ROLLS. No. 1. 
QUICK PROCESS. 
% gallon milk, % gallon water, 8 ozs. yeast, 
114 ozs. salt, 1 lb. sugar, 1 lb. lard. 

Set a slack warm sponge, with water, milk 
and yeast, at 85° Fahr., — flour and shop of the 
same temperature. At this temperature the 
sponge will be ready in one hour. Cream sugar 



952.— POCKET-BOOK ROLLS. No. 2. 
PLAIN MIXTURE. 
Take ten pounds of white sponge, eight 
ounces of sugar, eight ounces of lard, two 
ounces of salt, and one pint of milk. 

Make into a medium Arm dough. Let come 
up half and work over; repeat this once more 
and mold into rolls. 

953.— BUTTER ROLLS. 

FINGER ROLLS. 

10 lbs. sponge, 1 lb. butter, 8 ozs. sugar, 

a little salt, mace and lemon flavor. 

Work the ingredients into the sponge, and 
add more flour to make a medium dough. 

For a richer mixture three or four eggs may 
be added. 

Let it come up once and work over and make 
into rolls. Break in small pieces and mold 
round, give some proof and roll long with both 
hands; then twist and double up in rope 
fashion, brush with butter and set on pans, so 
they touch lightly; let prove and bake to a nice 
color. 

The same mixture may be made in Vienna 
crescents, braided twists, snails, and other 
fancy rolls, using a good egg-wash before bak- 
ing. 

For FINGER ROLLS, add eight eggs to the 
mixture. Break in one ounce pieces, mold round 
on the board, let rest for a few minutes. Form 
into fingers about five inches long, set on jians 
so they do not touch in baking. Let prove 
about half, wash over with egg-wash; set back 
to finish proving and b£ike to a nice color. 

954.— NEW ORLEANS ROLLS. No. 1. 
Take from doughs Nos. 949 or 950. Break in 
two-ounce pieces and mold on the board; then 
roll with both hands into long strips and double 
into a twisted knot. Set on pans so they touch 
in baking; brush over with melted butter or 
lard so they separate nicely, give good proof 
and bake in a good heat. 

955.— NEW ORLEANS ROLLS. No. 2. 

Take one gallon of milk sponge, or set a 
sponge with one gallon of milk and yeast, as 
usual. When ready, add to the sponge one 
pound of lard, eight ounces of sugar, one-half 
pint New Orleans molasses, one and one-half 
ounces of salt, one-half ounce of ground cinna- 
mon and ginger. 

Make a medium dough, let come up and work 
over. Break in pieces, mold round and give 
some proof. Roll out long and double up in 
twists, rope fashion. Set on pans singly^, give 
half proof, wash with egg-wash, finish proving, 
and bake to a nice color.

956.— COLUMBIA SOLLS. 

LONG SANDWICH EOLLS. 
FRANKFORT ROLLS. 
1 gallon water, 2 quarts milk, 3 ozs. yeast, 
12 ozs. lard, 12 ozs. sugar, 2% ozs. salt. 

Set a warm sponge with water and yeast. 
When ready, add sugar, salt and milk, and mix 
in the. flour; when half mixed, add the lard and 
make a smooth dough. Let come up and work 
over twice. Break out and mold in long fingers ; 
set on pans so they don 't touch in baking. Let 
prove half, wash with milk, give full proof, and 
bake in a good heat. 

These rolls are also called FRANKFORT 
EOLLS, because they are very convenient to use 
for a sandwich with the frankfort sausage. 
The rolls are made a little longer than the well- 
known sausage. They were sold in very large 
quantities during the Columbian Exposition, 
hence the name. The rolls may be made from 
any cheap roll dough, but should be proved 
light and have a soft crust. 

957.— SANDWICH ROLLS, PLAIN. 
1 gallon water, 2 ozs. yeast, 10 ozs. sugar, 1 lb. 
lard, 2 ozs. salt. 
Make a straight dough with the ingredients. 
Let come up and work over twice. Mold round 
and set on pans single. Give good proof, and 
bakie in about 450° Fahr., so they have a soft 
crust. 

958.— GRAHAM ROLLS. 
Use the Graham bread dough No. 921 or No. 
922. Mold in round or oval shape, set on pans, 
give medium proof, and bake in a good heat. 

959.— GRAHAM GEMS. 

Take from mixture No. 925. Mold round and 
set in gem or small muffin pans. Set in a warm 
prover to come up half, and bake in a good 
heat. 

Or take the following mixture : Three pounds 
of graham flour, one pound of wheat flour, 
three ounces of baking powder, two ounces of 
lard, three ounces of molasses, one-half ounce 
of salt. Sift the baking powder in the flour, 
make a bay in the centre, add the salt and 
molasses and the melted lard, mix with milk or 
water to a slack dough. Drop at once in the 
gem pans, and bake in a good heat. 

960.— SPECIAL HOTEL BREADS. 
Bakers in hotels are often called upon to 
make special breads for parties, banquets, etc. 
While generally the Vienna and French bread 
is used, many caterers prefer to serve a small 
individual loaf or roll to each person. This is 
an old custom brought over from Europe, 
where it has been in use for many years. The 
largest of these loaves is made in the shape 
of the Vienna loaf, or French loaf, weighs 
about seven ounces in the dough. It is made 



just long enough to fit exactly the oval silver 
tray in which it is served. The smallest loaf 
or roll is not more than two inches long, and 
weighs not quite one-half ounce. It is used 
to serve with soups, like consomme, or bouillon. 

As these breads are made to suit the fancy 
of the dinner-givers or caterers, they differ con- 
siderably in size, weight and quality. The 
small loaves like the French flute, about four 
ounces in weight, are mostly in use for a dinner 
loaf. Another is made of all milk dough, like 
the Vienna or French loaf, given several cuts. 
Another one is cut from end to end along the 
centre, which makes it look like a split loaf. 
One loaf is made round, from Vienna dough. 
It is cut across the centre before baking. 

These breads should be baked in steam and 
on the hearth, and have a good crust. They 
can also be baked on pans and without steam, 
but then should be washed with a light egg- 
wash before baking. 

A Vienna dough is considered best for these 
rolls, except where a very crisp, hard-crusted 
bread is wanted, it is preferable to use an all- 
water dough. 

For light luncheons, teas and receptions, 
where no heavy dishes are served, a light and 
rich bread is served, something like the French 
or Vienna Brioches (see Nos. 939 and 944), 
made in fancy shapes, like crescents, twists or 
fingers. 

Other breads used at dinners are SOUP 
STICKS, CHEESE STICKS, CHEESE 
STRAWS, PULLED BREAD, etc., etc. Cater- 
ers charge twenty cents per dozen for cheese 
and soup ^ticks and fancy finger rolls and 
brioches, so that there is a good profit in these 
breads. 

All these small breads should be made neat 
and attractive in appearance; the soup sticks 
and cheese straws small and dainty; better 
have them rather small than too large, to be in 
accordance with the other attractions which 
pertain to a good table. 

961.— SOUP STICKS. 

Take Vienna or American Rolls dough with 
a good shortening, but very little sugar in it. 

When the dough is ready, put it in a cool 
place to stiffen and to lose some of its springi- 
ness. It is better to mold, and keeps better 
shape when cold. Break in small pieces and 
form in strips of the length and thickness of 
a lead pencil. Put on pans, prove and bake in 
a cool oven crisp and dry. 

962.— SOUP STICKS WITH BAKING 

POWDER. 
These sticks can be made on short notice. 
Take one pound of flour, one ounce of baking 
powder, and one and one-half ounces of sugar, 
one ounce of butter, and mix with milk. Rub 
the butter in the flour, mix in the baking pow-

der and sugar, and mix with milk a little firmer 
than a tea biscuit mixture. Porm in strips 
like the other soup sticks, brush over with milk, 
and bake crisp and dry. 

963.— CHEESE STICKS. 
(PAIN SWISS.) 

Cheese sticks are served with fancy salads, 
and also at the beginning of the dinner, after 
the soups, with the hors d'ceuvres, which con- 
sist of small patties and other appetizers. They 
are made of puff-paste in which some dry 
grated cheese is rolled in. 

For gentlemen's parties it is often served 
deviled — that is, a dash of cayenne pepper is 
added to the grated cheese to sharpen the ap- 
petite. 

The best cheese for this purpose is a dry 
Parmesan, but a good dry American cheese will 
answer. 

Take a piece of pufE-paste, roll out thin and 
grate some cheese over it, fold in three and roll 
out again to one-eighth of an inch of thickness; 
wash with egg-wash and grate more cheese over 
it. Cut in strips five inches long and one-half 
inch wide, put on pans; let stand in a cool 
place for fifteen minutes, or longer, and bake 
nice and crisp in a medium heat. 

A good pie crust can be used, but puff-paste 
is better. 

964.— CHEESE STRAWS. 

Cheese straws are more like the soup sticks. 
They are served in the same manner as the 
cheese sticks. Take equal parts of butter, 
grated cheese and flour. Rub cheese and butter 
to a smooth paste, season with a pinch of 
cayenne pepper and some dry mustard and salt, 
add a few yolks of eggs, and mix with the 
flour and a little milk into a paste like a cookey 
dough. Set in a cold place to get firm, form in 
thin strips or straws about three and one-half 
inches long and set on pans. Bake in medium 
heat. 

The paste can also be made in thin biscuits. 
EoUed out one-quarter inch thick, cut into 
round biscuits one and one-half inches in diam- 
eter, prick with a fork, and bake to a nice 
fawn color. 

965.— PULLED BREAD. 

The original pulled bread is made by taking 
the inside out of a fresh baked loaf and pulling 
it apart by means of two forks in large flakes, 
which are toasted in the oven to a light brown 
crisp. 

A better way is to cut a fresh loaf in slices 
about one inch thick, trim off the crust and cut 
the slices in one-inch strips. Pull the strips 
slightly apart with a fork, and brown in the 
oven. 

This toast is served with cheese at dinner, 
and it is also used for invalids. 



966.— RASP ROLL. 

(EASPEL BEODCHEN.) 

The Rasp roll is also used as a special dinner 
roll, and in many other shapes for culinary 
purposes. 

These rolls are best if made from a good 
Vienna dough, and baked very crisp on the 
hearth. 

Grate off the dark crust evenly all around 
while the rolls are hot and just from the oven. 
Use a fine grater or a coarse rasp for this pur- 
pose. 

Eor a dinner roll, bake it about three ounces 
in weight, in the shape of a Vienna loaf, and 
remove the crust while hot. 

For sandwiches, make them in a small oval 
shape. 

The Rasp roll is also used in small round 
shape for a certain croustade. After the crust 
has been grated off, the top is cut from the 
roll, part of the crumbs removed, and refilled 
with a forcemeat, the top replaced and this 
roll is served with consomme, etc. 

For other use of the Rasp roll see Nos. 701 
and 702, Fritters and Croustades. 

967.— FANCY ROLLS AND BUNS. 

Where many kinds of rolls are made it is 
best to set one large sponge, from water only, 
or from milk and water mixed; and use it as 
described in No. 930. 

Many of the rolls given under the numbers 
from 937 to 958 can be made in smaller quan- 
tities after this method, by taking from the 
ready sponge and adding the other ingredients. 

For doughs which are made richer than the 
ordinary roll doughs, it is best to use more 
yeast in the sponges, and if sponge is used 
from a slow bread sponge, some yeast may be 
added dissolved in warm milk to make it come 
faster. 

Sponges are also used as half and three- 
quarter sponge; that means the liquid used in 
the sponge is one-half or three-quarters more 
than the liquid used on the dough; and often 
the sponge is used straight, without adding any 
liquid, except the eggs, butter and sugar and 
more flour. 

A good dough should be worked well till it is 
smooth and comes off the fingers, and it should 
be given some time to rest and prove up before 
using. 

968.— SPONGE FOR BUNS AND RUSKS. 

Take one gallon of milk and water mixed and 
four ounces of yeast. Set a warm sponge, rather 
firm, at about 85 to 100 degrees Fahr., and use 
from this sponge as directed in the following 
recipes. 

A larger or smaller amount may be made as 
required, and more, or only two ounces of yeast 
may be used, but it is preferable to use plenty 
of good yeast to make the goods prove up light.

969.— PLAIN BUNS. DOUGH, No. i. 

Take five pounds of the sponge, add one gill 
of milk, one-half pound of lard, one-half pound 
of sugar, one-half ounce of salt; flavor with 
mace and lemon. 

Work milk, salt, sugar and flavor in the 
sponge, add the flour and, last, the lard, and 
make a smooth dough. Let come up half and 
work over, then it is ready for molding. 

907.— BUN DOUGH, No. 2. 

10 lbs. sponge, 1 lb. butter, 12 ozs. sugar, 10 

eggs, Vz oz. salt, mace and lemon flavor. 

971.— BUN DOUGH, No. 3. 

10 lbs. sponge, 20 ozs. sugar, 20 ozs. butter, 

4 eggs, salt, mace and lemon flavor. 

972.— RUSK DOUGH, No. 1.

eggs, vanilla or lemon flavor. 

973.— EUSK DOUGH, No. 2. 

5 lbs. sponge, 1% lbs. butter, 8 ozs. sugar, 18 

eggs, lemon and mace flavor. 

Make into dough same as for plain buns. 

To the above mixtures currants, raisins, or 

chopped peel may be added to make the various 

kinds of fancy rolls and buns out of it. 

974.— STANDAKD DOUGH. 

In bakeries where a variety of sweet doughs 
are used, it is the practise to make a large 
sponge from all milk, or half mUk and water 
mixed, and make a, standard dough from this 
sponge, with eggs, sugar and butter in it. The 
buns and rusks, and often the zwiebach, are 
made out of this dough; and it is made richer 
for other goods. 

975.— STANDARD DOUGH, No. 1. 

Set a warm sponge with one quart of water 
and one quart of milk mixed, and four ounces 
of yeast. When ready, add two quarts of mdlk, 
one and one-half pounds of sugar, one and one- 
half pounds of butter, one and one-half ounces 
of salt, ten eggs; flavor lemon and mace. 

Break up the sponge with the sugar, salt, 
eggs and milk in it; work in the flour and add 
the butter. Work the dough well; let prove up 
half and work over; let come again and use it. 

976.— STANDARD DOUGH, No. 2. 
Set sponge with two qaurts of milk and four 
ounces of yeast. When ready, add one quart of 
milk, twenty ounces of sugar, twenty ounces of 
butter, five eggs, mace and lemon flavor, and 
salt. Work and finish like No. 1. 

977.— STANDARD DOUGH, No. 3. 
FOK COFFEE CAKE. 
STOLLEN. 
GUGELHUPF. 
ZWIEBACK. 
2 quarts of milk, 4 to 6 ounces of yeast. 
Set a warm sponge with milk and yeast and 



about four pounds of flour. When ready, add 
twelve eggs, one pound of sugar, one pound of 
butter, one-half ounce of salt, lemon or vanilla 
flavor. Work in the ingredients, let come up 
and work over, and let come up again, and work 
into COFFEE CAKE, PRETZELS, STOLLEN, 
GUGELHUPF and ZWIEBACK. 

The mixture may be made less expensive us- 
ing lard in place of butter, or using a part 
lard and less eggs. 

978.— HOT CROSS BUNS. 

Any of the standard mixtures may be used. 

Add one pound of currants to each five 
pounds of dough; or use half peel and half 
currants, as desired. 

The buns may be set single, or let them touch 
in baking. 

Have the dough rather slack, so they prove up 
light. Mold round, set on pans, give about half 
proof and cut with a sharp knife; or use the 
cross stamp. Wash over and sprinkle with 
sugar, or leave plain and ice after baking. 

979.— CURRANT BUNS. 

Take Bun mixtures from No. 969 to No. 971. 
Roll out in long strips about ten inches wide, 
sprinkle with currants; press the currants in 
the dough with the rolling pin, dust with sugar 
and cinnamon. Roll up from both sides to form 
a double coil; flatten the roll and cut in strips, 
set together on pans, cut side up. Give good 
proof, and bake in good heat. Wash with but- 
ter and dust with sugar and cinnamqn, or ice 
while hot. 

Another way is to make them like the Hot 
Cross Buns, No. 978. Set close together, prove 
without cutting, and leave plain; or dip in 
granulated sugar before panning, and bake as 
usual. 

980.— CINNAMON BUNS. 
Make like the Currant Buns No. 979. Roll 
out in one long strip; brush with butter, 
sprinkle with currants, sugar and cinnamon. 
Roll up like a jelly roll, cut in slices, set on 
pans cut side up, give good proof, and ice when 
baked. 

981.— SULTANA BUNS. 
Add to five pounds of plain bun dough one 
pound of sultana raisins. Mold in round or 
oval shapes, set single and wash with a light 
egg-wash before baking. Leave plain, or ice 
with water icing while hot. 

982.— GERMAN ALMOND BUNS. 
Add to Rusk dough No. 972, or to five pounds 
standard dough, eight ounces of chopped al- 
monds and eight ounces of currants, set single 
on pans, give half proof, wash with milk and 
egg-wash, sprinkle with chopped almonds and 
sugar, and bake in a medium hot oven. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



"S 



983.— GERMAN STEEUSEL BUNS. 
Add some currants to five pounds of standard 
dough. Break the dough in two-ounce pieces, 
mold in oval pieces, and set on pans single; 
give some proof and brush over with melted 
butter; flatten the rolls with the hand to about 
one-half inch of thickness, and sprinkle thickly 
with streusel; give good proof, and bake in 
medium hot ovens. 

984.— GERMAN STEEUSEL, No. 1. 
1 lb. powdered sugar, 1 lb. 4 ozs. cake flour, 
from 6 to 8 ozs. butter, 2 ozs. chopped almonds, 
lemon and cinnamon extract, or ground cinna- 
mon. 

Mix all the ingredients together like for short 
paste; sprinkle with a little milk; or, better, 
use one or two yolks of eggs, for the mixture 
to hold together, so it can be rubbed between 
the hands into small globular pieces. It may 
also be rubbed through a colander or a coarse 
sieve. 

984a.— GERMAN STEEUSEL, No. 2. 

1 lb. flour, 12 ozs. sugar, 6 ozs. butter, 1 egg, 

vanilla flavor, 1 drop bitter almond extract. 

985.— FLOEADOEA BUNS. 
Add to Bun dough No. 970, one pound of 
chopped cocoanut, eight ounces of candied 
orange peel, eight ounces of citron, and vanilla 
flavor. Set on pans in fingers, so they touch 
slightly on the sides, but not on the ends; 
prove and wash with egg-wash, sprinkle with 
shredded almonds, and bake to a nice color. 
Ice with vanilla water icing while hot. 

986.— OPEEA BUNS. 
Take mixture No. 971 or No. 972. Set on 
pans in fingers, like the Buns No. 985; sprinkle 
vfith chopped peanuts, and bake and ice in the 
same manner. 

986a.— BISMARK BUNS. 

Take plain Bun dough, or from No. 977. 
Mold up in round pieces on the bench, give 
some proof, flatten with the rolling pin or by 
hand. Place a little good fruit jam in the cen- 
tre, and pinch up the sides to enclose the jam. 
Set on pans so they touch in baking, let prove 
some and brush with melted butter; put back 
to finish proving. Bake in a good heat. 

When done, brush again with butter, and 
dust with a mixture of powdered sugar and 
cinnamon. 

987.— MAETHA WASHINGTON BUNS. 

Take from Standard dough No. 977. Roll 
out in strips about six inches wide, and not 
more than half an inch thick. Spread along 
the centre some of the Nut filling No. 115 or 



No. 116. Roll up, or fold the sides over the 
filling and form a long round strand about the 
thickness of a finger. Cut the strand in four- 
inch pieces, set on pans to touch, brush the 
sides with butter so as to separate nicely when 
baked; prove, wash with a thin egg-wash, 
sprinkle with coarse sugar, and bake to a nice 
color. 

988.— COCOANUT BUNS. 

Add to five pounds of Bun doflgh; one pound 
of fresh grated cocoanut, and flavor vanilla. 
Mold up in small pointed loaves, set single, 
prove, and bake in a good heat. 

Take some shredded cocoanut and brown to a 
light color in the oven. 

When the buns are baked and while warm, 
ice the buns and sprinkle with some of the 
browned cocoanut while the icing is soft. 

989.— CARAWAY BUNS. 

ANISE SEED BUNS. 
Add to some Bun dough caraway seeds or 
anise; flavor with lemon extract, or use grated 
lemon rind. Mold in round or oval pieces, set 
on pans single, let prove, wash with egg-wash, 
and bake in a good heat. 

990.— ENGLISH BATH BUNS. 

Bath buns are one of the old-time English 
buns and are made in several ways; they are 
made plain, or with fruit and peel; they are 
made in round shape; but often are dropped on 
pans in a rough way, which makes them look 
like rock cakes. They are washed with eggs 
and sprinkled with crushed pieces of loaf sugar 
before baking. 

Add to the Rusk mixture No. 972 or No. 973, 
eight ounces of flnely-chopped lemon or citron 
peel (currants may also be added), and set on 
pans as indicated above, and bake in medium 
heat. 

991.— BATH BUNS, PLAIN. 

Take four pounds of flour, one pound of 
sugar, one pound of butter, four ounces of 
yeast, five eggs, three pints of milk, one pound 
of peel and currants. 

Set a slack sponge with the milk, yeast and 
three pounds of the flour. When ready, make 
a smooth dough with the rest of the flour, and 
add the other ingredients. Let prove up half, 
then drop on greased pans rather rough-shaped, 
in two-ounce pieces, single. Let prove, wash 
with a good egg-wash and sprinkle with a 
coarse granulated or crushed loaf sugar, and 
bake in medium heat.

PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



992.— EUSK. 

Eusks are made very much like the buns ; but 
they are generally made of a richer dough, 
which contains more butter and eggs, but less 
sugar. 

Fruit is not used in Eusks, but caraway and 
anise seeds are added, also almonds. 

The Eusks are set on pans and baked single, 
and also set close and baked in squares. Some 
bakers make them in the shape of a long Parker 
House or pocket-book roll, and cut the folded 
side with scissors or knife before proving, which 
looks pretty when baked. 

Take the French Brioche No. 939, or use 
mixtures Nos. 972 and 973, as directed. 

Eusks are often used toasted like the follow- 
ing Zwieback, but, should be a day old. 

993.— ZWIEBACK. 

Zwieback means twice baked, and it is made 
in a variety of shapes. A very light and porous 
dough is best suited for Zwieback. It should 
be made fresh every day, baked, and when one 
day old, toasted fresh several times during the 
day. There is as much difEerence in a stale and 
fresh toasted Zwieback as there is in fresh and 
stale toasted bread. The Zwieback should be 
toasted in the oven to a light brown color, but 
fully dry. 

The Eusk mixtures and also the other stand- 
ard dough mixtures may be used for Zwieback. 

994.— HAMBUBG ZWIEBACK. 
Take from No. 976. Have the dough rather 
slack, mold on pans round and set single in 
one-ounce pieces, give good proof and bake in 
medium heat. Let stand and cool over night, 
or at least six hours; cut with a sharp thin 
knife in halves, set on pans and toast dry to a 
nice brown. Set the tops and bottoms together 
when dry, and put away for use. 

995.— HAMBUBG CHILDEEN ZWIEBACK. 

These Zwieback are made without sugar, and 
are used for invalids and in the nursery. 

Take one pint of milk, one pint of water, two 
ounces of yeast, one-half ounce of salt, twelve 
ounces of butter, twelve ounces of potato-starch 
or cornstarch. 

Make a slack sponge with the mixed milk and 
water, add yeast and some wheat flour. When 
ready, add the cornstarch and salt, and work in 
the butter and more Hour to make a rather firm 
dough; let come up and work over; then mold 
round in one-half -ounce pieces on pans; prove 
and bake like the other Zwieback. Cut and dry 
when cooled. 

This Zwieback is used with milk as a baby 
food. 

996.— SAXON ZWIEBACK. 
Take from No. 977 or No. 971. Break out in 
one-half-ounce pieces, mold round, and then 



form in fingers about three inches long. Place 
the fingers together in rows and let prove. Give 
good proof and bake to a nice color. The day 
after baking, cut in slices and toast on pans to 
a nice brown. 

997.— VIENNA ZWIEBACK. 
Take Mixture No. 973. Mold and bake in 
long ovals or in finger shape. Cut when cold 
and toast like other Zwieback. 

998.— HUNGAEIAN ZWIEBACK. 
PEESSBUEGH ZWIEBACK. 

Bake like No. 997. Form in finger shapes, 
larger on both ends than in the centre; cool and 
cut in halves and toast dry. 

Make a meringue icing; beat five whites of 
eggs firm, stir in one pound of powdered sugar, 
and add two ounces of shredded or chopped 
almonds, and flavor vanilla. Spread this icing 
over the toasted side of the Zwieback, and set 
back in the oven to dry to a fawn color. 

A variety of other similar Zwieback is made 
round or in long shapes, which are iced with 
vanilla or cinnamon icing, like the above Zwie- 
back. 

999.— ANISE ZWIEBACK. 
The Eusk mixtures with anise seed may be 
made into Zwieback in the same manner. An- 
other mixture is given in No. 374, under Anise 
Toast, which is made like a sponge cake mix- 
ture. Left-over stale pound cake may also be 
made into a nice toast to be served with wines 
or liquors. 

1000.— COFFEE CAKES. 

Coffee cakes are made from all the mixtures 
given for buns and rusks, and also from the 
standard mixtures (see Nos. 970 to 977). The 
French savarine and Baba mixtures, also the 
Gugelhupf mixtures are used as Coffee Cake 
(see Nos. 408 to 412). 

For hotel use the most convenient shape of 
baking the flat Coffee Cakes is to use layer 
cake or pie tins. Weigh the dough about twelve 
to fourteen ounces, mould round and flatten in 
the tins; sprinkle with almonds, sugar and cin- 
namon, or streusel. Let prove and bake. These 
small cakes may be cut in slices like pies, and 
are very nice to serve in this manner. 

For bakeries they are generally baked in one 
sheet and cut in pieces, or are baked in squares 
to sell for from ten to fifteen cents. 

Other shapes of Coffee Cakes are baked in 
forms of tin, Turk's head shape; some in form 
of stollen, and others again in form of large or 
small pretzels and rings. 

1001.— STEEUSEL COFFEE CAKE. 
STEEUSEL KUCHEN. 
Take from No. 972 or No. 973; or for less 
rich cake the mixtures Nos. 974 to 977. EoU 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS.

out four pounds of the dough the size of a bak- 
ing pan, or make small pieces and lay in pie 
tins. Wash with milk or egg-wash and sprinkle 
thickly with Streusel No. 984. Give good proof 
and bake in medium heat. When baked, brush 
with melted butter while hot, and dust with 
sugar and cinnamon. 

1002.— CINNAMON CAKE. 
Prepare like No. 1001. Roll out and wash 
with melted butter, sift over a thick layer of 
sugar and cinnamon, and bake in medium heat, 

1003.— EAISIN COFFEE CAKE. 
To five pounds of dough No. 972, add two 
pounds of sultana raisins and currants mixed. 
EoU out and brush with melted butter, give 
medium proof and bake plain. When baked, 
the cake may be washed with butter and 
sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon, or iced 
with vanilla water icing. 

1004.— ALMOND COFFEE CAKE. 
Add to five pounds of dough one pound of 
chopped almonds and one ounce of bitter al- 
monds. Koll out, wash with egg-wash and 
sprinkle with chopped almonds, and bake to a 
nice color ; or ice with vanilla icing when baked, 
and sprinkle with some browned almonds while 
the icing is soft. 

1005.— GERMAN APPLE CAKE. 

Take from any of the plain bun doughs. Roll 
out into a thin sheet and line a well-greased 
baking pan. Press up well around the sides, 
and give some proof. Take good baking ap- 
ples; peel, core and cut in thin slices; put the 
apples on the cake in even rows, give some more 
proof; sprinkle a few currants over, and some 
sugar and cinnamon, and bake. The cakes may 
be brushed with melted butter before or after 
baking, or some milk or cream sprinkled over 
before baking. 

If the apples color too much, a buttered paper 
may be placed over the fruit during baking. 

1006.— OTHER FRUIT CAKES. 

Plums, peaches and apricots may be stoned 
and cut in halves and laid on the dough like for 
apple, cake. Cherries and blueberries are picked 
over, washed and put on whole. 

Some bakers use a thin pastry cream or a 
custard, which is poured over the fruit before 
baking. 

1007.— POTATO CREAM CAKE. 
Roll out a thin bottom and line a baking sheet 
like for fruit cakes, and give some proof; then 
fill with the following mixture : Take two and 
one-half pounds of boiled potatoes; peel while 
warm and let cool, and grate the potatoes in a 
bowl. Separate eight eggs; beat the yolks and 
twelve ounces of sugar together, add gradually 
to the potatoes; then add eight ounces of sifted 



flour, six ounces of melted butter; flavor with 
cinnamon, or lemon and mace, and add one-half 
pint of milk or cream; beat the whites of eggs 
light and mix all together. Spread this cream 
over the cake evenly and bake in a good heat. 
When done, dust with powdered sugar and 
cinnamon. 

1008.— VANILLA CREAM CAKE. 

Take one quart of milk, sixteen eggs, four 
ounces of butter, twenty-four ounces of sugar, 
and four ounces of cornstarch. 

Boil milk and sugar; dissolve starch in a lit- 
tle cold milk. Add the starch to the boiling 
milk and take off the fire; stir in the butter; 
add the beaten eggs, and flavor vanilla. 

Spread this cream over a pan lined with cake 
dough like for fruit cake, sprinkle a few cur- 
rants over and bake. Dust with powdered sugar 
when done. 

1009.— GERMAN CHEESE CAKE. 

For the best kinds of Cheese Cake the Tart 
fillings No. 187 and No. 194 may be used. For 
the regular Cheese Cake use the following mix- 
tures: Take three pounds of dry cheese-curd, 
eight eggs, six ounces of butter, eight ounces 
of sugar, three ounces of flour, six ounces of 
currants, six ounces of sultana raisins, four 
ounces of chopped almonds, half a pint of 
milk, a pinch of salt, a little mace, and the 
grated rind of one lemon. 

German bakers add saffron to Cheese Cake, 
which gives a peculiar flavor, and also more 
color to the mixture. If used, it should be dis- 
solved in a little hot water. 

Line a pan with dough like for No. 1007, and 
prepare the mixture like No. 187 or No. 194. 
Spread evenly over the dough, and bake in 
medium heat. Sift over some powdered sugar 
and cinnamon when done. 

Some bakers leave out raisins and almonds, 
and sprinkle only some currants over the cheese 
mixture before baking. 

1010.— FRENCH COFFEE CAKES. 

For richer kinds of cakes, like tea rolls, but- 
ter pretzels, snails, etc., etc., more butter is 
added to the standard mixtures. The butter is 
rolled into the dough like for puff paste, which 
gives these goods a flaky appearance when 
baked. The dough is also named VIENNA 
COFFEE CAKE DOUGH by many bakers. 

For each pound of standard dough roll in 
from two to six ounces of butter, which should 
be of the consistency of the dough. (Part lard 
may be used for cheaper goods.) 

Take five pounds of any of the standard 
doughs, and set in a cool place to stiffen up for 
one hour. Take one pound of washed out but-

PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OP BRSADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



ter; roll out the dough about one inch thick 
and spread the butter over two-thirds of it in 
little pats; fold over like pufE paste No. 75; 
fold in three times; let rest and give two more 
turns and the dough is ready for use. 

This kind of dough should be kept cool and 
proved cool; if set in a warm closet, or in 
steam, the butter will run out and the cakes run 
flat. 

Keep from drafts during proving, and raise 
the goods in the ordinary shop temperature of 
about 65 to 70 degrees Pahr. 

1011.— FEENCH TEA EOLL. 
Take a piece of the prepared dough. EoU 
into a thin sheet about half an inch thick. Cut 
in strips about .eight inches long and three- 
quarters of an inch wide; give each strip a 
twist, and double up and twist again, rope 
fashion. Set on pans, let prove, wash with eggs 
and bake. Ice while hot with vanilla water 
icing. 

1012.— WEEATHS. 

FEENCH COEEEE CAKES. 

EoU out and cut in long narrow strips ; braid 
three strips together, form into a ring, joining 
the ends nicely together. Set on pans, give 
good proof, wash with egg-wash and sprinkle 
over a few chopped almonds. Bake and ice 
with vanilla icing. 

These cakes are made to sell at five and ten 
cents each, and may be made larger for special 
orders. 

1013.— BUTTER PEETZELS. 
Boll and cut in long narrow strips ; twist each 
strip and form into pretzels. Prove, bake, and 
ice like No. 1011. 

1014.— SNAILS. 

CHELSEA BUNS. 

EoU and cut the prepared dough in long nar- 
row strips. Twist each strip and coil it up like 
a watch spring. Set on pans, prove, wash and 
bake. Ice after baking. 

Another way to make the buns is to take only 
plain standard dough, roll out into a thin sheet 
about one-quarter inch thick and twelve inches 
wide; brush the sheet over with melted butter, 
sprinkle with currants and finely chopped al- 
monds and citron; dredge with powdered sugar 
and cinnamon. Roll up the sheet like a jelly 
roll. Brush the outside of the roll with butter, 
and cut the roll in slices about half an inch 
thick; set on pans cut side up, so they touch 
slightly on the sides in baking. Let prove and 
wash with egg-wash, and ice after baking, or 
sprinkle sugar on top before baking. 

The rolls may be made of any size to suit 
prices. 



1015.— GEEMAN KEANZ KUCHEN. 
Take a piece of the prepared French dough, 
or use plain standard dough. Roll out into a 
long sheet, eighteen inches long, ten inches 
wide, one-quarter of an inch thick. Cream to- 
gether four ounces of sugar, six ounces of but- 
ter, and one egg; flavor with mace and lemon 
extract. Spread this cream over the sheet, 
sprinkle with sultana raisins, currants and 
finely-chopped citron. Roll up like jelly roll, 
sei on pan and form a ring, joining the ends 
nicely. Set to prove. When half proved, cut 
the top with scissors halfway down in the cen- 
tre in zigzag. Set back to prove, and then bake 
in medium heat. When done, brush with but- 
ter and dust with sugar and cinnamon; or it 
may be iced and sprinkled with shredded and 
browned almonds after baking. 

1016.— GERMAN STOLLEN. 
CHRISTMAS CAKE. 
StoUen is the German fruit cake for the holi- 
days, and they are made as rich as the Amer- 
ican fruit cake, but are raised with yeast. The 
German housewife gets busy about one month 
before the holidays to make these StoUen, be- 
cause if very rich they improve if a couple of 
weeks old, and become rich and mellow. 

1017.— STOLLEN, NO. 1. 
Take five pounds of milk sponge, or set a 
warm milk sponge with one quart of milk and 
two ounces of yeast. Add to the sponge one 
and one-half pounds of butter, twelve ounces 
of sugar, eight eggs; flavor mace and lemon, 
and make a medium firm dough. Add one 
pound seeded Malaga raisins, one pound of sul- 
tana, eight ounces of currants, eight ounces of 
chopped almonds, with a few bitter almonds, 
eight ounces chopped citron and orange peel. 

1018.— STOLLEN, NO. 2. 
Take five pounds of dough No. 973. Add one 
pound of sultana, two pounds of currants, eight 
ounces of citron and lemon peel. 

1019.— ALMOND STOLLEN. 
Add to 973, two pounds of sweet almonds, 
three ounces of bitter almonds, eight ounces of 
finely-chopped citron. 

1020.— AMERICAN STOLLEN. 

Take five pounds of standard dough, make it 
a little firmer than for coffee cakes; add eight 
ounces of raisins, eight ounces of currants, and 
four ounces of citron; flavor mace and lemon. 

The StoUen are made from two to five pounds 
and more. In Germany they are baked on the 
hearth. Over here (in America) they are baked 
on pans. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



"9 



Mold the Stollen long like a Vienna loaf, and 
press along the centre with a long rolling pin 
and flatten down ; fold over like for pocket-book 
rolls, the bottom larger than the top. Set on 
pans to prove. Brush over with melted butter 
before and after baking, and dust with sugar 
and cinnamon. 

The plainer Stollen are washed with egg-wash, 
baked, and iced after baking. 

1021.— AMERICAN GUGELHUPF. 
BUND KUCHEN. 

Take four pounds of patent flour, one quart 
of milk, three ounces of yeast, sixteen eggs, 
twelve ounces of sugar, one and one-half pounds 
of butter, half a pound of sultana raisins, half 
a pound of currants, four ounces of citron, four 
ounc^ of chopped almonds; flavor mace and 
lemon. 

Set sponge with milk and two pounds of the 
flour. When ready, add the other ingredients 
and flour; let come up once. Butter the molds 
well and sprinkle with chopped almonds, fill 
half with the mixture, let raise to about three- 
quarters and bake in jiedium heat. 

1022.— ALMOND GUGELHUPP. 

Take five pounds of milk sponge; add one 
pound of butter, twelve ounces of sugar, fifteen 
eggs, eight ounces of chopped almonds; flavor 
mace and lemon. 

Beat all together very light, fill in well-but- 
tered molds at once, let raise and bake like 
above. 

The cakes may be dusted with sugar and cin- 
namon while warm, or buttered before adding 
the sugar. 

For other cakes of this class, see FRENCH 
BABAS and SAVARINE CAKES and others, 
Nos. 408 to 412. 

1023.— DOUGHNUTS. 

For plain Doughnuts take from Nos. 969 to 
971. The better grades may be made from the 
mixtures Nos. 972 to 977. 

The cakes are fried in hot lard. The lard 
should have the right degree of heat when the 
cakes are put in, otherwise the grease will soak 
into the cakes and make them unfit for use. 

One other point which should be watched is 
not to give full proof, or use too much baking 
powder, as the cakes would get too porous and 
soak in the grease. 

Boll out the dough into a large sheet, about 
half an inch thick, cut with the Doughnut cut- 
ter, set in cloth-lined boxes to prove ; cover, and 
give about three-quarter proof. Fry in hot 
lard. Dust with powdered sugar and cinnamon. 

1024.— BERLIN PAN CAKE. 
BISMAEKS. 
Take from standard dough No. 977, and have 



the dough soft and smooth. Mold on the table 
in round one-ounce pieces, or larger. Give n 
little time to prove, then flatten out and put a 
little jam in the center. (It is not advisable to 
use jelly, because it runs out — becomes too soft 
in frying.) Pinch up the dough over the jam, 
set in cloth-lined boxes and let raise. Fry like 
the doughnuts. Dust with sugar and cinnamon 
when done. 

1025.— VIENNA KRAPFEN. 
Take from the mixture No. 973. Roll out a 
thin sheet about one-quarter inch thick. Cut 
rounds with a scalloped cutter, put a dot of 
jam in the centre, wash the edge and put an- 
other piece on top; press the edges together, 
set in cloths, let raise and fry in hot lard. 
Finish like dougtanutB. 

1026.— DOUGHNUTS WITH BAKING POW- 
DER, 

CRULLERS WITH BAKING POWDER. 

No. I. Two pounds of flour, one ounce of 
baking powder, four ounces of butter, six 
ounces of sugar, eight yolks, two whole eggs, 
one gill of milk, lemon extract and mace. 

No. II. Three pounds of flour, one and one- 
half ounces of baking powder, six ounces of 
butter, eight ounces of sugar, from six to eight 
eggs, one and one-half pints of mUk, flavor. 

No. III. Four pounds of flour, one pound of 
sugar, four ounces of butter, two ounces of 
baking powder, four eggs, one quart of milk, 
lemon and mace. 

Sift the baking powder into the flour; cream 
butter and sugar with the eggs, add flavor, and 
mix all together to a smooth dough. Cut with 
the doughnut cutter, or the cruller cutter, and 
twist them. Fry and finish like doughnuts. 

1027.— BUTTERMILK DOUGHNUTS. 
SOUR MILK DOUGHNUTS. 
Prepare like the other recipes without bak- 
ing powder. Add for each pint of buttermilk 
one teaspoonful of baking soda. 

When using sour mUk it is often necessary 
to add some cream of tartar, sifted in the flour, 
to neutralize all of the soda. 

1028.— FRENCH CRULLERS. 
Prepare the paste No. 105, and make like the 
ring fritters, see No. 693. 

1029.— ENGLISH MUFFINS. 
ENGLISH CRUMPETS. 

Muffins and Crumpets are very popular in 
England, where they are consumed in large 
quantities. They are made and sold in the 
mufSn shops, and also peddled on the streets. 
Both are raised vrith yeast and baked on the 
griddle, or hot plate, like the wheat and buck- 
wheat cakes. 

The muffins are served hot, pulled apart in 



PAUL RICHARDS BOOK OF BREADS, CAKKS, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



halves (not cut), and spread with butter. They 
are also eaten with milk or cream. 

The English muflSns should be about three 
inches in diameter and one inch thick when 
baked. 

The crumpets are about five to six inches in 
diameter, and about one-quarter of an inch 
thick. 

In some of the American restaurants or 
lunch rooms the crumpets are baked in the 
smaller muflSn rings, and are served as English 
muffins. 

Take two quarts of water, or use half milk, 
one ounce of yeast, half an ounce of salt, and 
a good bread flour. 

Make a soft dough, work it well, but make it 
slack like a sponge; set it about luke warm, 
let raise to the drop, beat it down again, and 
let come up half. 

Prepare some bread boxes and fill with sifted 
flour about three inches deep. Take a muffin 
cup, or a coffee cup of small size, and make 
half-round impressions in the flour, a little 
distance apart. Drop the dough out by hand, 
in the impressions, in two-ounce pieces, just like 
drop cake; dust over with a little flour; cover, 
and let prove to near double size. Lift care- 
fully from the flour, stretch lightly, but keep in 
shape, and place on the griddle to bake. 

Some bakers set these muffins in rings to keep 
an even shape. 

When done on one side, turn carefully over 
with cake or palette knife, and finish baking. 
The best muffins of this kind are made from 
pure milk without any water, and some muffin- 
makers make the dough just firm enough so it 
can be molded, instead of dropping out. 

A richer kind of mufSn is made from two 
quarts of milk, two ounces of yeast, twelve 
ounces of sugar, twelve ounces of butter, eight 
eggs, half an ounce of salt, a little grated nut- 
meg or mace. These are called SALLY LTJNN 
MUFFINS, and are baked like the English 
muffins. 

1030.— ENGLISH CEUMPETS. 

Take two pounds of flour, one quart of milk, 
half an ounce of salt, one ounce of yeast. 

Make this into a soft batter, about blood 
warm. Let raise to the drop, beat down again 
very smooth, and let raise about half. The bat- 
ter should be of a thick flowing consistency, 
thicker than buckwheat or wheat cake batter. 
Fill the batter in a dipper with a deep spout; 
grease the griddle and the rings; place the 
rings on the griddle and fill nearly full with the 
batter, spreading it with the palette knife. 
When colored to a nice brown at the bottom, 
turn over with the ring and finish baking. 

Both muffin and crumpets can be made from 
a large water or milk sponge; taking to five 



pounds of sponge, half an ounce of salt, and 
work it to the right thickness — firmer for 
muffins, and slacker for crumpets. 

1031.— CEUMPETS WITH BAKING 
POWDEE. 

Two pounds of flour, one and one-half ounces 
of baking powder, two ounces of butter or lard, 
two ounces of sugar or molasses, half an ounce 
of salt, one quart of water and milk mixed. 

Sift the baking powder in the flour with the 
sugar and salt, add the milk gradually and beat 
into a thick batter, and add the melted butter. 
Bake like the other crumpets. 

By adding a little more flour — about eight to 
ten ounces — it could be made into an imitation 
of the English muffin ; cutting with a large cut- 
ter, and baking it like the muffins. 

1032.— AMEEICAN BUTTEE CAKES. 

Butter cakes are baked like the English 
muffins, and are raised with yeast, or with bak- 
ing powder, or soda. The mixture is cut out 
like tea biscuits, set in boxes, proved, and 
baked on the griddle. They are sold in many 
restaurants and lunch rooms. 

Take four pounds of flour, three pints of but- 
termilk, half an ounce of salt, half an ounce 
of soda, two yolks of eggs, and one ounce of 
melted butter. 

Take half cake-flour and half bread-flour j 
sift with the salt and soda three times; put in 
a bowl, make a bay in the centre and add two 
pints of the milk ; work in the flour and add the 
butter and the rest of the milk. A little more 
milk may be required, according to the strength 
of the flours. Work well into a very smooth 
dough, like for a soft tea biscuit dough. Put 
on the table, flatten into a square and let rest 
for half an hour to lose its springiness; roll 
out, let rest again to loosen up; then cut with 
a large biscuit cutter. Set in cloth-lined and 
dusted boxes; let raise, well covered, to about 
one inch thick, and bake on the griddle, like the 
muffins. 

1033.— SALLY LUNN. 
2 quarts milk, 2 ozs. yeast, 12 ozs. sugar, 8 eggs, 
12 ozs. butter, % oz. salt, flavor mace or 
nutmeg. 

Set a warm sponge with three pints of milk. 
When ready, add the remaining pint of milk, 
eggs, salt and sugar; add flour and the soft- 
ened butter. Make a soft dough, but work it 
well ; make it as slack as it can be handled. Let 
prove up and double in size, and work over; 
then scale in eight to ten-ounce pieces, mold 
round on the board, set in greased pie tins, or 
layer cake tins, and flatten to fill the tins; 
brush over with melted butter and let prove up 
half. Take the dough scraper and cut each cake 
in four pieces, set back to finish proving, and 
bake in a good heat. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



This mixture may be used like for Englisli 
muffins, as indicated at the bottom of No. 1029. 

1034.— SALLY LUNN MUFFINS WITH 
BAKING POWDER. 
4 lbs. flour, 3 ozs. baking powder, 3 pints milk, 
6 ozs. sugar, 8 ozs. butter, 8 eggs, % oz. salt, 
a little mace. 
Mix like No. 1031. Bake in muffin cups, or 
in rings. Set on a baking sheet in a well- 
heated oven. 

SCOTCH SCONES. 
1035.— PLAIN SCONES WITH BUTTER- 
MILK. 

Scones are eaten in large quantities in Eng- 
land and Scotland. The scones are made plain 
with flour, buttermilk, salt and soda, and some 
bakers add lard or butter. The fancy kinds 
are made richer; sugar and butter is added, 
also flavorings, raisins, currants and peel. Soda 
and cream of tartar and baking powders are 
used in place of buttermilk and soda. Scones 
are eaten hot like muffins, split and buttered. 
The mixing should be done quickly, before the 
soda and acid works out. 

Take three and one-half pounds of flour, one 
ounce of soda, half an ounce of salt, and four 
ounces of butter. 

Eub the butter in one part of the flour, sift 
soda and salt in the other part; mix together 
and add about three pints, or less, of butter- 
milk to make a smooth dough; divide in twelve- 
ounce pieces, mold round; then roll out half an 
inch thick; cut each round crosswise with the 
dough scraper in four pieces, like for Sally 
Lunn. Set on pie tins so they do not touch 
too close, prick with a fork and set in the 
proof box for about fifteen minutes, to raise. 
Wash with egg-wash and bake in a good heat. 

If no buttermilk is at hand, use sweet milk; 
leave out the soda, and sift two teaspoonfuls 
of soda and four and one-half teaspoonfuls of 
cream 6i tartar in the flour. Make and finish 
as directed. 

1036.— FANCY SCONES. 
Take four pounds of flour, two yolks, one 
ounce of soda, two and one-quarter ounces of 
cream of tartar, a little salt, eight ounces of 
butter, eight ounces of sugar, lemon and mace; 
add half a pound of currants, or half a pound 
of sultana raisins; or, half a pound of mixed 
peel, currants and raisins. Mix and bake like 
plain scones. 

1037.— NEW YORK BUTTER CAKES. 

Take one quart of milk, one pound of flour, 
eight ounces of butter, eight ounces of sugar. 

Set milk, sugar and butter on the fire and 
let come to a boil ; then stir in the sifted flour, 
like you would make a cream puff mixture ; take 
oflE the flre, let cool a little, and work into this 
paste five yolks and five whole eggs. 



Take about two and one-half pounds of white 
yeast-raised sponge, and work this with the 
scalded paste and some more flour to a smooth 
dough. Let this dough rest and prove for half 
an hour; then roll out and cut into large bis- 
cuits, like other butter cakes. Set in cloth-lined, 
well-dusted boxes; let prove, and bake like No. 
1032. 

The same mixture may be made into butter 
biscuit, using a smaller cutter. Set on pans 
single, let prove, wash with egg-wash and leave 
plain, or dip in granulated sugar before setting 
on the pan, and bake in a medium hot oven. 

1038.— YEAST RAISED MUFFINS. 
SWEET BISCUITS. 
4 lbs. flour, 1% ozs. yeast, 3 pints milk, 8 eggs, 
8 ozs. sugar, 12 ozs. butter, a little salt, flavor 
mace. 

Prepare and raise the dough like for No. 
1033. When ready, fill into greased muffin 
rings placed on a baking sheet; fill the rings 
half with the batter, let prove up full, and 
bake it a good heat. 

1039.— WHEAT MUFFINS. 
2 lbs. flour, 1% ozs. baking powder, 8 ozs. but- 
ter, 5 ozs. sugar, 5 eggs, 1 quart of milk, a 
little salt and mace. 
Cream butter and sugar, sift baking powder 
in the flour, and mix like for cakes. Fill into 
rings like No. 1038, or in muffin cups, and baie 
in medium heat. 

1040.— GRAHAM MUFFINS. 
Take mixture No. 959 and bake in muffin 
cups. 

1041.— CORN MUFFINS. 

2 lbs. wheat flour, 1 lb. cornmeal, 12 ozs. sugar, 

2 ozs. baking powder, 8 ozs. butter, 8 eggs, salt, 

2% pints of milk. 

Mix like cake and fill into well-greased cups. 

Bake at once in a good heat. 

1042.— JOHNNY CAKE. 
Take the mixture No. 1041, and bake in deep 
pie tins. 

1043.— RICE MUFFINS. 
Take mixture No. 1039; add one cupful of 
boiled rice, rub through a sieve, and bake like 
other muffins. 

1044.— POPOVER MUFFINS. 

These muffins are best baked in high cups or 
large sized timbale molds. No baking powder 
is used. They puff up very high and are hol- 
low. A very thin batter is required. They may 
be baked in small quantities from the same bat- 
ter, because the muffins get tough and soft, and 
lose much of their goodness when cold. They 
are excellent when eaten hot and crisp with 
good butter. 

Take one pound and four ounces of flour, 
eight eggs, one pint of milk, one pint of water 
(or use one quart of skimmed milk), one tea- 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BRBADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



spoonful of salt. Beat eggs and milk and water 
together, add salt and the well-sifted flour ; beat 
all together to a thin batter free from lumps. 
Fill the well-greased molds about half with the 
batter and bake in medium heat for thirty 
minutes. 

1045.— EYE MUFFINS. 

Take one pound of rye flour, half a pound of 
wheat flour, six ounces of white cornmeal sifted 
with one and one-half ounces of baking powder ; 
add four ounces of sugar, four eggs, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt ; mix this with about one quart 
of milk, and add four ounces of melted butter. 
Bake like wheat muffins. 

1046.— GINGER MUFFINS. 

Take twelve ounces of sugar, six ounces of 
butter or lard, one and one-half pints of milk, 
one and one-half pints of molasses, one table- 
spoonful of ginger, one tablespoonful of all- 
spice, a little salt, one teaspoonful of soda, and 
four eggs. 

Mix like ginger bread, adding flour to make 
a soft batter. Fill into well-greased cups and 
bake in medium heat. 

The Ginger Bread mixtures Nos. 298 and 299 
may also be used for muffins. 

1047.— SPICED MUFFINS. 
1% lbs. cake crumbs, ly^ lbs. flour, 4 ozs. lard, 
1 lb. sugar, 1 pint molasses, 8 eggs, % oz. soda, 

1 tablespoonful allspice and ginger, a little salt. 
Mix with milk like for cakes, not too soft. 

Fill into muffin cups, and bake in medium hot 
oven. 

1048.— EGG MUFFINS. 
1% lbs. flour, 10 eggs, 1 lb. sugar, 8 ozs. butter, 
3 teaspoonfuls baking powder sifted in the 
flour, % pint milk, a pinch of salt; flavor mace 
and lemon. 

Mix like for cakes, and bake in muffin cups 
in medium heat. 

1049.— TEA BISCUIT. No. 1. 

3 lbs. flour, 3 ozs. baking powder, 2 ozs. sugar, 

6 ozs. butter or lard, % oz. salt. 

1050.— TEA BISCUIT. No. 2. 

12 lbs. flour, 8 ozs. cream of tartar, 4 quarts 

milk, 3 ozs. soda, 6 ozs. salt, 2 lbs. lard. 

1051.— SOUE MILK BISCUIT. 
2% lbs. flour, 2 teaspoonfuls salt, 4 ozs. butter, 

2 small teaspoonfuls soda, 1 quart sour milk! 
Sift soda in the flour, rub the lard in one 

part of the flour, and mix all into a light 
dough. EoU out and cut into biscuits, set close 
together, wash with milk and egg-wash, and 
bake in a good heat. 

1052.— SWEET BISCUITS. 
Take four pounds of flour, one pound of but- 
ter or lard, twelve ounces of sugar, six eggs, 
flavor of vanilla or lemon, two and one-half 
ounces of baking powder, about one and one- 
half pints of milk. 



Mix like for cakes, and make in a dough like 
for other tea biscuits. Mold in round pieces 
like for rolls; set together so they touch lightly 
in baking; wash with a light egg-wash and 
bake in a good heat. 

1053.— PLYMOUTH EOCK BISCUITS. 
Take mixture No. 1052. EoU out half an 
inch thick and cut with oval crimped cutter; 
set on pans single, wash with egg and put a 
strip of cut citron in the centre. Bake in 
medium hot oven. 

1054.— CUEEANT BISCUIT. 

3 lbs. flour, 2% ozs. baking powder, 10 ozs. 

sugar, 10 ozs. butter, a scant quart of milk, a 

little salt, 3 eggs, 12 ozs. currants, flavor mace 

and lemon. 

Cream butter, sugar and eggs, sift flour and 
baking powder, and mix into a soft dough; 
roll out and cut in large biscuits. Wash and 
bake as usual. 

To these sweet mixtures seeds of caraway or 
anise may be added; also raisins or chopped 
almonds, and a variety of biscuits can be made 
in this manner, and given the appropriate 
names. 

Left-over biscuits, without fruit, may be 
toasted like zwieback, and served as TOASTED 
TEA BUSK or zwieback. 

The same mixtures can be made a little firmer 
with more flour, and molded in oval or finger 
shapes, set on pans single, washed and baked 
plain, or with a sprinkling of sugar on top of 
each biscuit; or molded round, and then made 
in shape of the pocket-book roll, etc., etc. 

1055.— SOUTHERN BEATEN BISCUITS. 

Beaten Biscuits are made in many Southern 
families, and also in hotels. They are not well 
known in the Northern States, and are, in fact, 
more like a cracker than like a. biscuit. The 
Maryland or Virginia biscuit is made of water 
and looks like the well-known water-cracker, 
and is made of the same size. The other 
Beaten Biscuit is made with milk and of a 
smaller size. Both require a firm dough. The 
dough is beaten and folded over till it blisters. 
A large heavy club or a big rolling pin is gen- 
erally used for this purpose. Where larger 
quantities are made, rollers are used like in 
cracker bakeries. 

1056.— MAEYLAND BEATEN BISCUIT. 

Take one pound of old dough left over from 
baking, and thin this up with one pint of water, 
add one teaspoonful of salt and four ounces of 
butter or lard. 

Mix this all together with more flour into a 
firm dough. Beat with pin till smooth. Form 
in long roll and break in pieces, mold round 
and let rest on the table, well-covered with a 
moist cloth, to recover; flatten each biscuit and

firm dough. Beat this dough till it blisters ; let F'iH the batter, which should be very thin, 
rest well covered. Boll out to one-third of an into well-greased pie-tins, and bake as directed, 
inch thick; let rest and recover. Cut with a To eat, cut in slices, split each slice and 
small cutter not more than two inches in spread with fresh butter, and you will have a 
diameter, put on pans, prick, and bake in corn bread fit for a king, 
medium heat. 

The dough should be kept moist during the 
rest, to prevent drying out; this gives the bis- 
cuits a nice color in baking. Very little flour 
should be used for dusting.

the buttermilk, add eggs and the other flour, 
and make up like a tea biscuit dough. Divide 
into loaves, set in pans and bake in a good heat. 



1064.— SOUTHEEN EETJIT BEEAD. 

Take ten pounds of white bread sponge; add 
one quart of molasses, eight ounces of lard, one 
pound of currants, eight ounces of raisins, one 
ounce of allspice, and one ounce of salt. 

Work this into the sponge with more flour ;_ 
let rest and come up once. Scale in loaves, and 
bake in tins as usual.

ground nuts. Mix with the milk and molasses 
into a smooth dough, mold into loaves, and 
bake in long narrow pans in a good heat. 

Other nut meats may be used, and the 
graham and whole wheat breads may be made 
into nut breads in the same manner. 

1066.— OATEN BEEAD. 

2 lbs. oatmeal, 2 lbs. graham flour, 2 lbs. wheat 
flour, 1 oz. yeast, 1 quart water, 1 quart mUk, 

1 cup molasses, 4 ozs. lard, 1 oz. salt. 
Set a warm sponge with yeast, water and 
wheat flour. When ready, make a dough rather 
slack with the milk and other ingredients. Let 
come up once, then mold into loaves, pan and 
give only medium proof, and bake in good heat. 

1067.— HOTEL WAPELES. 

HOTEL GKIDDLE CAKES. 

The best kinds of Wafiles and Griddle Cakes 
can be made just like the yeast-raised English 
Crumpets No. 1030, by adding the enriching 
ingredients when the sponge is ready; then 
beating the batter well together, and let raise 
again for half an hour or so. 

For waffles, the batter is made of about the 
same thickness as for crumpets; for the other 
Griddle Cakes a softer batter is required. 

For YEAST-EAISED WAEELES add to the 
Crumpet mixture, for each pound of flour, four 
whole eggs, or six to eight yolks; four ounces 
of butter, and one ounce of sugar. Flavor of 
cinnamon, mace, lemon, or vanilla may be 
added. 



For the GEIDDLE CAKES, add to each 
pound of flour one and one-half ounces of sugar 
or syrup, from one to two ounces of butter, 
salt and two whole eggs, or yolks only. 

The waffle irons or griddle should be hot and 
well greased when the batter is filled in. 

The waffles are often dusted with sugar and 
cinnamon or vanilla sugar when baked, and are 
also served plain and eaten with honey or 
syrup, or with milk and cream like the griddle 
cakes. 

1068.— WAFFLES with BAKING POWDEB. 

Take four pounds of flour, two ounces of bak- 
ing powder, four ounces of sugar, one pound 
of butter, eight yolks and six whole eggs, a lit- 
tle salt, flavor of mace or lemon. 

Sift the baking powder in the flour, beat 
eggs and sugar, add about two quarts of milk 
and mix well; beat in the melted butter, and 
bake in well-greased irons. 

1069.— CEEAM WAFFLES WITH SOUE 

CEEAM OE BUTTEEMILK. 

2 lbs. flour sifted with % oz. of soda, 12 yolks, 

1 oz. sugar, a pinoh of salt. 

If buttermilk is used, add six ounces of 

melted butter; no butter is required if cream 

is used. Mix and bake like No. 1068. 

1070.— FEENCH WAFFLES. 
2 lbs. flour, % oz. baking powder, 2 ozs. sug^*, 
4 ozs. butter, 12 eggs, a little salt, 1 quart mils. 

Separate the eggs, mix like No. 1068; add 
the whites of eggs, beaten to a firm froth, the 
last thing, and mix in carefully. Bake liks the 
others. 

1071.— HOLLAND WAFFLES. 
SPRING WAFFLES. 

These waffles are fried in hot lard like the 
Eoman cases (see Nos. 106 and 107). The iron 
used is formed in a coil. It is heated in the 
grease, then dipped in the batter almost to tha 
edge, and back again in the hot grease. When 
done, the waffle is removed from the iron by a 
slight knock, and served with sugar or cinna- 
mon. 

It is also served as a sweet entree or dessert, 
with a compote of prunes or other fruit, or with 
a rich vanilla cream sauce. 

Take one pound and eight ounces of flour, six 
ounces of sugar, one pint of milk and ten well- 
beaten eggs. 

Mix flour, sugar and milk smooth, then add 
the eggs and mix again, and use as directed. 

1071A.— EOSETTE WAFEES. 
EOSETTE WAFFLES. 
The Bessettes are similar to Spring Waffles. 
The irons are patented and sold in all depart- 
ment stores, two different shapes, with handle, 
for fifty cents. The irons are smaller than the 
spring wafBe irons.

The recipe for the batter is: Two eggs, one 
teaspoonful of sugar, a little salt, one cup of 
milk, one eup of flour (a little more if neces- 
sary). Beat eggs slightly with sugar and salt, 
add the milk and flour and beat until smooth. 

If wanted for oysters, etc., leave the sugar 
out of the batter. 

The Eosette Wafers make a very nice dessert 
to be served with strawberries or sliced peaches 
and whipped cream; also with preserved fruits 
or jams. They are very nice if served with 
whipped cream sprinkled thickly with chopped 
nuts or browned almonds, etc.; or they may Be 
served plain, hot or cold, with powdered sugar 
and cinnamon dusted over them. 

The same wafers, without the sugar, may be 
used as a canape for oysters, creamed chicken 
or veal, with asparagus or poached or scrambled 
eggs ; and any vegetable with a cream sauce can 
be served in the same way. 

1072.— "WHEAT CAKES. 
FLANNEL CAKES. 

Sift together three pounds of flour, three 
ounces of baking powder, six ounces of pow- 
dered sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt; mix 
with milk to a thin batter, add six beaten eggs 
(or the yolks only), and three ounces of 
melted butter. 

For FLANNEL CAKES four ounces of corn- 
meal may be added. 

1073.— GEAHAM CAKES. 

WHOLE WHEAT CAKES. 
Graham cakes may be raised with yeast, like 
buckwheat cakes, or with baking powder in the 
following manner : Take two pounds of graham 
flour, or whole wheat flour, and two pounds of 
wheat flour ; sift three ounces of baking powder 
and half a teaspoonful of soda in the wheat 
flour; mix both flours together, add milk to 
make a soft batter, also half a pint of molasses, 
four beaten eggs, four ounces of melted butter, 
and one teaspoonful of salt. Mix smooth and 
bake like wheat cakes. 

1074.— BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 
Take four pounds of buckwheat flour and one 
ounce of yeast; set a soft sponge in the evening 
with water. In the morning add one cupful of 
molasses, four to six ounces of melted butter, 
one ounce of salt, and one cupful of milk. Beat 
this all well together, and if the batter is too 
thin add some sifted wheat flour (some people 
prefer cornmeal). Let rise for ten minutes and 
bake. Keep the batter in a cool place, and add 
a teaspoonful of soda to prevent turning sour. 

1075.— BUCKWHEAT CAKES with BAK- 
ING POWDEE. 
Add to four pounds of buckwheat flour four 



ounces of baking powder and half a teaspoon- 
ful of soda. Mix with half milk and water to a 
soft batter; add one cupful of molasses, six 
ounces of melted butter, and one ounce of salt, 
and bake as usual. 

1076.— BOSTON GEIDDLE CAKES. 
Use the self-raising Boston brown bread 
flour; or, use one pound of wheat flour, one 
pound of rye flour, one pound of graham flour, 
and one pound of cornmeal; add three ounces 
of baking powder, half a teaspoonful of soda, 
one cup of molasses, four eggs, six ounces of 
butter, and half an ounce of salt. Mix with 
milk like Graham Cakes No. 1073. 

1077.— COEN GEIDDLE CAKES. 
Take one pound of wheat flour, one pound of 
cornmeal, two ounces of baking powder, four 
ounces of sugar, four ounces of butter, four 
eggs, and a little salt. Mix with milk and bake 
like Wheat Cakes No. 1072. 

1078.— EICE GEIDDLE CAKES. 
Make the wheat cake batter, and add one cup 
or more of soft boiled rice. 

1079.— GEEMAN PAN CAKES. 

Take one pound of flour, twelve eggs, a little 
salt; mix with cream or milk. 

Separate the eggs; stir the flour with the 
milk, smooth; add the yolks and salt, add the 
whites of the eggs beaten to a froth. 

Have the frying pan hot, put in some butter, 
and fry in rather thick cakes to a nice brown 
color on both sides. Dust with sugar and cin- 
namon and serve. 

1080.— APPLE PAN CAKE. 
Use the batter No. 1079. Peel and slice 
very thin some good cooking apples, or chop 
like mince meat. Mix with the batter, and fry 
in butter on both sides till the apples are soft. 
Dust with sugar and cinnamon. 

1081.— POTATO PAN CAKE. 
Take half a pound of boiled and cooled pota- 
toes, grate or rub through a sieve; add two 
ounces of flour and two ounces of sugar; mix 
with twelve yolks and five ounces of melted but- 
ter; add a pinch of salt, the grated rind of 
half a lemon, a little mace; mix well and add 
the beaten whites of the eggs. Fry in butter 
on both sides. Dust with powdered sugar and 
serve. 

1082.— THE USE OF FEUITS IN CAKES 
AND BUNS. 
When using fruit in buns or coffee cakes, the 
fruit should be prepared the day before using. 
Eaisins, currants and chopped peel are often 
used in very dry condition; they draw moisture 
from the cakes and make them dry. It is pref- 



126 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BRBADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



erable to moisten the quantity of fruit used 
for each day, the day before, with a light 
syrup; the fruit gets soft and regains the 
natural shape. In this way it is more accept- 
able in cakes and much better to eat. 

1083.— EGG- WASH AND OTHER GLAZINGS 
FOE BREAD, ROLLS AND BUNS. 

To give a glazing to breads and rolls after 
baking, a thin wash of cornstarch is generally 
used for breads which are not baked in steam. 
The wash is made with one and one-half ounce 
to two ounces of cornstarch and one quart of 
boiling water. Potato starch gives the best 
gloss, and can be made from raw grated pota- 
toes 

Peel and grate four medium-sized potatoes in 
one pint of water; mix well and strain through 
a sieve, the starch will settle on the bottom 
after a few minutes; add about one more pint 
of boiling water, and stir on the fire till it is 
clear and like mucilage; then it is ready for 
use. 

A wash for buns is made from gelatin or gum 
arable, which has also to be used while the buns 
are hot. Dissolve one ounce of gum in cold 
water; when soft, pour over about three pints 
of boiling water and stir till dissolved; add a 
little alum or salt, and keep the wash in a cold 
place. 

Egg-wash may be made of different degrees 
of strength by mixing yolks of eggs with water 
or milk. 

For a rich-looking wash a little burnt sugar 
is often added, or egg color. 

The wash is applied to the goods before bak- 
ing. 

1084.— THE MANIPULATION OP BREAD- 
MAKING RECIPES. 

At the closing of this chapter on Bread- 
Making I would like to say a few words in re- 
gard to working of the recipes. 

The difference of the flours used in all parts 



of this country make it difBcult to state the 
exact quantity of flour and liquids used; and to 
insist upon the exact amounts would certainljr 
invite failure, and would cause the mixtures to 
be either too slack or too firm, according to 
the strength of the flour. For this reason much 
depends on the intelligent judgment of the 
workman, to add to or decrease the amount of 
flour and liquid. 

The treatment of yeasts, sponge and doughs, 
and the use of the thermometer has been ex- 
plained in the opening of this chapter. 

Machinery is being used more and more every 
day. Most all modern bakeries use dough 
mixers, dough dividing and molding machines, 
which lighten the heavy labor in baking. 

To regain the flavor of the malt and stock 
yeasts formerly used, progressive bakers who 
use compressed yeast add malt extract, malt 
sugar, or grape sugar in baking, and use potato 
flour in starch form in place of the potato fer- 
ment, to give moisture and flavor to the bread. 

Malt extract, also grape sugar, if added to 
the sponge, acts as a stimulant and ripens the 
sponge more rapidly, but loses some of the malt 
flavor during this process; therefore, if used as 
flavor, it is preferable to add it to the dough 
where more of the flavor is retained. The 
potato flour in starch form may be used in 
sponge and dough to keep the bread moist. 

Salt is used as a flavor, and also as a cheek 
on fermentation; it prevents the souring of the 
dough, and should be used more freely in sum- 
mer than in winter. 

It has been demonstrated by practical bakers 
that it is best to add the lard used in baking, 
after all the flour is worked into the dough, 
which makes the dough finer of grain. The 
doughs should be well worked, and plenty of air 
beaten into it. This increases the proving qual- 
ities and gets it ready in a shorter time for the 
oven. 



THE PASTRY-ROOM IN THE HOTEL. 



The art of making bread and pastry consists 
of several distinct trades, and to be successful 
and become perfect in this art takes years of 
hard work and study. While outside of the 
hotel Breadmaking, Cakes and Pastry, Ice 
Cream Making, and also the Preserving of 
Fruit are special vocations, in the hotel they 
are combined into one business, and the work 
is often performed by one person. 

In the largest hotels the work is divided into 
several parts: a regular baker is employed for 
the bread baking, but under the supervision of 



the pastry cook, who is supposed to understand 
both branches. 

Besides the four different trades named 
above, the pastry cook must know how to pre- 
pare a variety of Hot and Cold Puddings, and 
is often asked to make Candies and prepare 
Ornamental Fancy Pieces for decorating the 
tables for special occasions. 

Baking and pastry work is more difficult to 
learn, and it requires a longer time than the 
meat cooking; and although the two branches 
of hotel work are closely affiliated to each other, 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



the pastry work is not paid as well. I think 
this is one of the reasons why good pastry cooks 
are more scarce to-day than good meat cooks. 

Many a young baker or confectioner starts to 
work in the pastry room to learn the trade. He 
has probably been at his own trade for several 
years, and wants to learn pastry cooking. After 
some years of hard work he loses courage; he 
sees some other young fellow in the kitchen who 
started to learn the meat cooking at the same 
time he started in the pastry-room, and had no 
idea of cooking, getting away ahead of him, 
getting into better paying places, having a 
larger salary, and, often, even shorter hours of 
work, or more time off. The next chance this 
young man gets he leaves the pastry-room for 
the kitchen, or goes back to his first trade. 

Bread and pastry making requires to rise 
early in the morning to have the rolls ready for 
breakfast. And because the pastry is the last 
course of the dinner, the pastry cook is often, 
the last man in the kitchen, when all the other 
cooks are off duty. I have known several of 
the best pastry cooks who have quit the pastry- 
room for the kitchen, and who have become very 
good chefs in a short time. 

THE PASTEY-EOOM. 

A good pastry-room should consist of two 
parts adjoining each other: one, the warm part, 
with the oven in it; and a cool part, the pastry- 
room proper. 

Bread making requires a warm even tempera- 
ture free from drafts. 

Pastry making, cake baking, and the making 
of cold puddings requires a cool place — the 
cooler the better. 

These two different facts have been in recent 
years often neglected. In the endeavor to have 
an ideal kitchen, and have the working depart- 
ments on the same floor with the dining-room, 
the pastry-room is often squeezed into such a 
small space, that it is almost impossible to do 
good work. 

The lack of space compels the use of portable 
ovens, which take up less room, but radiate 
more heat than the ovens built of bricks. 

The open wire partitions in those kitchens 
also cause drafts, and often more additional 
heat from the near-by range. This makes it 
still more difficult to do good work. 

Although it is desirable to have the pastry- 
room on the same floor as the kitchen, because 
it saves time and help, and also gives better 
service, too much concentration is detrimental 
to good work. 

A properly constructed shop, equipped with 
the right kind of appliances, makes work a 
pleasure, while unsatisfactory arrangements 



127 

cause loss of money, spoil good materials, and 
are often the cause of frequent changes of help. 
This is largely because a good workman prides 
himself in doing good work, which cannot be 
done if the conditions of the shop do not per- 
mit it. 

SEEVING 0¥ PASTEY. 

The proper serving of pastry is an art, which 
is of as much importance as the making of it. 
It requires well-trained skilled help, and should 
be done from the pastry-room if possible. What 
is the good of making dainties, if they are not 
served in the proper way? 

The dishes in which the different things arei 
served in should be selected so they can be used 
with the proper effect. Ornamental puddings 
and jellies, fancy charlottes, ices and creams, 
look better if served in shallow dishes. It 
shows off to advantage the side decorations, and 
makes it look larger. In a deep saucer the 
pudding would lose much of' its attractiveness. 
The sauces should be served in a decorative 
manner. 

Whipped cream, sweetened, makes a nice 
sauce for decorating, and may be used for 
almost any cold pudding, and for many other 
dishes. 

A proper taste in colors and flavors, also in 
forms, is required in serving, and many a plain 
dish can be made very attractive, if this point 
is observed. 

■ A variety of different shaped molds should be 
used for puddings to make a change. If dif- 
ferent puddings are made always in the same 
forms, they look very much alike, and this must 
be avoided. 

Puddings should be made as much as possible 
in individual molds, from which they can be 
turned out before serving; and this is also a 
more economical way. Other puddings can be 
baked in the individual pudding dishes, and 
served in dishes they are baked in. 

This way of serving puddings in the dishes 
they are baked in could also be made a source 
of profit for lunch counters and cheaper res- 
taurants. The brown German custard cups and 
deep pudding dishes are the best for this pur- 
pose. The puddings can be made more tender 
and permit the use of less eggs, and can bfc 
sold at a good profit. They can be made more 
fancy with meringue, or could be decorated 
with jelly, etc. 

For the steamed puddings and steamed rolls 
I have been using a long round mold, which 
opens longways in two halves. The form is 
lined with buttered paper when used, then 
filled with the mixture, some space left for the 
pudding to expand, the frame closied and 
steamed in this manner. This insures even 
round slives, and is preferable to the old way 
of boiling in a napkin. 



128 



PAUL RICHARDS BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



Por the cold puddings the refrigerator is the 
best place to serve from. It should be placed 
in a handy position to serve from. 

EOUj WAEMEE. 

The problem of keeping the rolls in proper 
condition during the breakfast is the source of 
much trouble. Many of the appliances in use 
keep the rolls hot, but dry them to such an 
extent that they are unfit for use after they 
have been for some time in the heater. Other 
heaters have too much steam inside and the 
rolls become soggy. The best roll warmer I 
have used is a closet of galvanized sheet iron, 
with double sides and bottom, which can be set 
on the carving stand. The bottom of the heater 
has an opening to fit over the hole in the stand. 
It could be made also with steam circulating 
from pipes. The inside of the closet contains 



three perforated shelves, each large enough to 
hold one of the ordinary size roll pans. This 
leaves one shelf for mufSns, and two for the 
different rolls. 

But there are many heaters Uke that. The 
main feature of this heater was a small vent, 
which let in just enough steam to keep sufSeient 
moisture to keep the rolls in the proper condi- 
tion. The door of the heater should be auto- 
matic self-closing, to keep the heat inside, be- 
cause frequent opening causes any heater to 
cool off. 

A heater like this may also be used for keep- 
ing pudding warm, if it can be set in the right 
place. 

For a pudding heater a small gas heater, or, 
better, an electric heater, on which a pan con- 
taining water can be placed, is very handy for 
use. It can be connected with a rubber hose, 
taken off and set aside when not in use.

1085.-CANDY MAKING and MISCEL- 
LANEOUS RECIPES. 

Candy making is not practised to a great ex- 
tent in hotels. Caterers and bakers make only 
the plainer kinds, which can be made without 
expensive machinery, as used by the practical 
candy manufacturers. But even for the plainer 
kinds of candies some tools and appliances are 
required to make them successfully; without 
those appliances, it is cheaper to buy them from 
the dealer. 

The utensUs required, consist of a good sized 
Marble Slab about three inches thick, a set of 
Candy Bars to enclose the boiled sugar, a Cop- 
per Candy Kettle, a Spatula and Scraper, some 
Wire Trays, Molds, a Candy Hook, a Caramel 
Cutter, a Drop Cutter, a Funnel Dropper, and 
a small Double Kettle for dipping cream 
candies. 

In the chapter on preserving fruits, I have 
given the sugar boiling degrees by the ther- 
mometer, and also the finger test (No. 67). 

For Syrup Testing, the saceharometer is 
used; and it is also used in sugar boiling for 
testing the density of the hot syrups for crys- 
tallizing tiU to the soft ball, or to about 
140° Fahr. (see Beaume syrup scale No. 703). 
For higher degrees in boiling, it cannot be used 
with reliance. 

FONDANT, or Cream as confectioners lerm 
it, is largely used in fancy candies. It is made 
for candies in the same manner as given for 
Fondant Icing (see No. 205). The cream is 
used for dipping candies, and also for centers. 
Two creams are generally made for this pur- 
pose. The cream for dipping is made of sugar 



with a very small quantity of glucose added; or 
cream of tartar is used with pure sugar. For 
the center creams, about four ounces of glucose 
is added to each pound of sugar and is boiled 
a few degrees higher. 

To use the dipping cream, it is warmed in a 
small double kettle, something like a rice boiler, 
and stirred gently till it is soft enough to cover 
fruit or nut pastes or center creams, which are 
dipped into it on a small spoon-shaped wire. 
The creams are colored and flavored at this 
point, and should be kept at an even temper- 
ature of about 95° Fahr., or about blood warm. 
Over heating causes the cream to set hard and 
dry. It is convenient to make this cream in 
large batches, as it will keep for a long time, 
and store it away; then it may be used as re- 
quired. 

In boiling the sugar, particular care should 
be observed to keep the sides of the kettle free 
from the small particles of sugar which are de- 
posited there by the steam from the boiling

Three pounds of sugar, one pound of glucose, 
one pint of water, the meat of one large fresh 
grated cocoanut, or twenty ounces of desiccated 
cocoanut. 

Fresh cocoanut is preferred for this candy. 
The desiccated cocoanut should be moistened in 
steam, or stirred in a kettle on the fire with a 
little water, till the water is evaporated and has 
softened the nut meat. 

Boil to the soft ball degree; take the kettle off 
the fire, and rub the sugar on the sides of the 
vessel with the spatula till it whitens and granu- 
lates; stir this into the rest of the sugar till it is 
all white and milky; then add the cocoanut; mix 
and cover and let cool. Now work this up with 
the spatula into smooth cream. From this mix"

in the starch prints, left there to dry. and then are 
dipped in sugar, or crystallized. 

Very dry powdered starch is put in flat boxes,

funnel or a lip pan is used for filling, and starch 
powder is sifted over when the casting is done. 
The boxes are placed in dry closets till the candies 
are dried sufficiently, The starch is brushed oS, 
and they are ready for use.

1123.— SUGAR CASTING IN MOLDS. 

Fruits, flowers and figures may be cast in molds 
of metal or plaster of paris. The molds are oiled 
while cold,, and the oiling is repeated after each 
cast. For fruits, artificial stalks may be added, 
and when the casts are removed from the molds, 
they may be painted to imitate Nature. 

Take six pounds of sugar, three pints of water 
and one teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Stir on 
the fire till dissolved. Wash down the sides to 
avoid graining, and boil on a good fire to the hard 
crack, or 300° Fahr. Put the sugar in the lip pan 
or funnel and run into the molds. 

If the casting is desired hollow, allow the out- 
side crust to form, then dip the molds to let the 
sugar run out from the centre. 

1 124. —CRYSTALLIZING CANDIES AND 
FRUITS. 

The crystallization of candy, and also of candied 
fruits, is done by placing bon-bons, jelly drops, 
or fruits in clarified syrup which has been boiled 
to the blow or feather degree of' about 235° Fahr. 
(Or, if the syrup scale is used, the boiling syrup 
should register about 33-34 degrees Beaum^.) In 
this state the sugar crystallizes readily, and forms 
crystals on the sides of the pan and on anything 
which is suspended in it. 

The crystallizing pans or boxes are made in 
form of trays about ten by twelve inches square 
and three inches deep. The bon-bons are placed 
in the box in rows and are covered with the syrup. 
The pans are covered and set away to crystal- 
lize for ten to twelve hours. The pans are then 
inclined, and the syrup is drained from the pan. 
The bon-bons remain till dry, and are packed in 
wax paper. 

To prepare the syrup for this purpose, use loaf 
sugar. Dissolve eight pounds in three quarts of 
cold water, stir till dissolved, and put on the fire. 
Let boil to the blow degree, 240' Fahr. (Or test 
with the syrup scale. ) When the boiling syrup 
reaches 33 or 34 degrees Beaum& take it off the 
tire, set the kettle in cold water, cover with a 



Fruits to be crystallized must first go through 
the process of candying, as described in the open- 
ing chapter of fruit jellies and preserves (see 
Candied Fruits and Fruits Glaces.) The fruits 
should be perfectly dry when put in the crystal- 
lizing symp. The small fruits are placed in the 
trays covered with a wire screen to prevent rising 
in the syrup, and the syrup is poured gently over 
the fruit and set to form the crystals. When you 
test the fruit, and judge the crystals to be of the 
proper size, the syrup is drained like for bon-bons, 
by inclining the trays, and the fruit is left too dry 
till no more moisture is left The fruit is then 
packed in bt)xes lined with wax paper. 

1125.— GUM DROPS. 

ENGLISH GUM DROPS. 

Take four pounds of sugar, two and one-half 
pounds of glucose, one pint of water, and ten 
ounces of gelatin. 

Soak the gelatin in cold water. Set sugar, 
glucose and one pint of water to boil, and boil to 
the ball degree, or 244° Fahr. Take off the fire, 
add flavor and color and the soaked gelatin strained 
from the water. Mix well and let stand for a few 
minutes. Take off the scum which arises. Fill 
in the funnel dropper and run into starch prints. 
Let dry, and take from the starch. Moisten 
lightly with gum water, or hold in a sieve over 
steam for a moment, and roll in granulated sugar. 
The drops may now be used, or further crystal- 
lized for better goods. 

1126.— AMERICAN GUM DROPS. 

Take two pounds of sugar, two pounds of glu- 
cose, a pinch of cream of tartar, and eight ounces 
of lump starch. 

Dissolve the starch in three quarts of water. 
Let the glucose and sugar come to a boil, add the 
cream of tartar, and strain the water and starch 
on the boiling sugar. ( This process is best done 
in a jacket steam boiler, same as used in the 
pastry room. ) Boil down to a thick syrup, or 
drop a little in powdered starch; it should form a 
soft elastic ball. Color and flavor, and fill into 
starch prints. Finish as directed in No. 1125. 

1127.— LIQUOR DROPS. 

Five pounds of cut loaf sugar, three pints of

vent the turning of the sugar into caramel; let cool 

a little, and use with the spoon as directed above. 

1 139. —WEBB SUGAR. 

For a silver webb, use the same sugar as above 
without any coloring. For a gold web, boil the 
sugar a little higher, till it turns yellow. A little 
saffron color may be added. 

As soon as the sugar reaches the proper degree, 
take the pan off and set it in cold water for a 
minute, and let the sugar cool a little. 

Take a bunch of straight wires tied together, or 
use an egg beater with the ends cut off straight. 
Take a stick and hold it up high in your left hand, 
dip the points of the wire in the sugar with the 
right hand and throw it over the stick, where it 
will hang from it in fine threads. When sufficient 
threads have accumulated, place them on the table 
and cut in suitable lengths. This sugar is used 
to represent the hair of helmets, the water of a 
fountain, etc. 

An easier way to prepare the web sugar for 
nests (for which purpose web sugar is mostly used) 
is to place five or six long sticks (clean broom or 
peel handles will do) crosswise between two tables. 
Place on the floor, under the sticks, some sheets 
of paper, to take up any drops of the sugar fall- 
ing on the floor. 

When the sugar is ready, and has cooled some, 
dip the points of the wire in the sugar, and pass 
the wire with a quick forward and backward mo- 
tion over the sticks, so the sugar forms in long 
threads on the sticks. 

Set the sugar in a pan with hot water, or keep 
near the fire, if it should cool too much during 
this process. When a sufficient part of the web 
is formed, put it on the table and cut it in suit- 
able lengths to form the nests. 

These finely-spun threads of sugar are very 
much affected by a damp atmosphere, and readily 
collapse, losing much of their beauty. For this 
reason they are best made only a short time be- 
fore using, and should be kept in a dry place, or 
placed in tin boxes till wanted for use. 

1 140.— NOUGAT SUGAR WORK. 

From the nougat mixture No. 1116, other large 
decorations are made in form of castles, temples, 
vases or baskets. The nougat is cut after the de- 
signs, or pressed in metal forms, which are gener- 
ally made in two parts; each half is lined with the 
nougat, both sides are pressed together and left 
in the mold till cold. 

Baskets made from nougat are fastened to 
another plate or socle, made also from nougat, or 
from the gum paste or the croquant pastes No. 
88 and No 8g. The handle is made from spun 
sugar in two pieces, which are fastened together 
and on the basket with caramel sugar. Or a 



CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 

plainer handle may be made by boiling sugar to 
the hard crack and, when cooled on the slab, pnll 
and twist, or braid into handle, and bend it over 
a half round tin. When cold, fasten it to the 
form by heating the ends on the fire, or with 
caramel. 

Other pieces of this kind may be made from 
clear or colored sugar, boiled to the hard crack, 
and poured on the marble slab in a thin sheet. 
When cool enough to handle, the sugar is pressed 
in the molds like the nougat, and finished in the 
same manner. Blanched almonds are split and 
colored over the fire in prepared syrup, and 
pressed in the soft sugar in the molds to form 
borders or other designs. 

Large baskets and vases of this kind made from 
brown nougat, clear or colored sugar, may be 
filled with frozen creams, molded in the shape of 
flowers or fruits (fruits made from marcipan paste, 
or flowers made of sugar); and also with fresh or 
candied fruits, dipped in caramel. 

1141.— CHANTILLY BASKETS. 

These baskets are made of macaroons, or 
meringues, and also of fruits dipped in sugar 
boiled to the hard crack. A mold is used, slightly 
oiled, and the edge of the macaroons is dipped in 
the boiled sugar, and they are fastened together 
on the inside or outside of the mold. When the 
sugar is cold, the form is taken off the mold and 
fastened to a bottom or socle made from gum 
paste or croquant paste, iced and ornamented 
with royal icing. 

The basket may also be fastened on a shallow 
di.h of china with caramel sugar. 

The inside may be lined with Charlotte russe 
crust No. 97 or No. 98, or with ladyfingers, and 
filled with sweetened whipped cream. The handle 
may be made from spun sugar or royal icing. 

The finishing touches may be put on with the 
comet to make a pleasing effect. 

1 142.— FRUITS IN CARAMEL. 

All kinds of fresh or candied fruit, also almonds 
and nuts, may be dipped in sugar boiled to the 
hard crack or to the' caramel degree. 

Cherries, strawberries, grapes, etc., should be 
freed from the stalks; the oranges peeled, all the 
white pith removed, and divided in natural divis- 
ions; the fruit should be perfectly dry. Nuts or 
almonds may be stuck on a wire and dipped in 
the sugar. For the other fruits a wire bent in 
spoon shape is used. The fruit, after it is dip- 
ped, is placed on the slab or on wire grates to 
drain and harden. When cold, it may be used to 
build baskets or pyramids, fastening the pieces 
together; or it may be served in single pieces, or 
filled in nougat baskets or cornucopias.

No. 413. 

1147.— PLASTER OF PARIS MOLDS. 

Take the original from which the cast is to be 
made, and with a soft brush coat it with sweet oil; 
suspend it in a frame or box about one inch larger 
in diameter. Prepare the plaster of paris quickly 
but carefully, sprinkling the powder in cold water, 
stirring at the same time, till it forms a thick 
creamy mass; then pour it in the frame to sur- 
round and cover the object. 

It will harden in about ten minutes; but it is 
best to let harden in the cast for about half an 
hour. 

Smooth casts are sawed in halves. 

Angular figures have to be cut in more parts. 

An opening is cut if the molds are intended for 
casting in sugar or in fat. 

The molds may be made more durable by ex- 
posing them to a dry heat. 

Candy molds are varnished on both sides. 

To make half casts for molding, the oiled object 
may be pressed halfway down in the thin plaster 
and removed when the plaster hardens; but a 
better way to make such casts is to take common 
potters' clay and press one-half of the object into 
the clay, leaving only the part exposed of which 
the cast is to be made. Brush the exposed part 
with oil, place a frame around the object and pour 
in the plaster. 

For border and face casts of this kind, sulphur 
is often used; also for casting the faces of coins 
and medallions. The sulphur is melted on a slow 
fire, the object oiled and the cast is made the same 
way as with the plaster of paris. 

To make stands for ornamental pieces, it is ad- 
visable to use wooden stands of suitable size, and 



cover them with thin layers of gum paste; or use 
a brush and some royal icing diluted with gum 
water. 

Borders may be made from gum paste, or the 
stand may be piped with royal icing. 

Plain royal icing after it becomes dry falls from 
the coated objects, and the wooden stand should 
be rubbed or brushed with diluted fruit jelly be- 
fore putting on the icing, which makes it adhere 
better. 

1148.— FIGURES AND SOCLES FROM FAT, 
WAX, STEARIN AND PARAFFIN. 

For figures take even parts of paraffin and 
stearin; or, take one part of paraffin, one part of 
mutton tallow, one part of white wax, and one 
part of lard. 

Melt all parts together on a slow fire; do not let 
the mixture get too hot, because it turns the fat 
yellow, and the cast objects should be white. 

When the melted fat has cooled a little, make 
the castings. If color is added, it should be done 
while the mixture is hot. 

The plaster molds used for casting should be 
laid in water of about 75" Fahr. for half an hour 
before casting; then drain off the water, run in 
the fat and put the mold in cold water. 

If you wish the castings hollow, allow a little 
time for the outside crust to from, reverse the 
mold, let the liquid part run out, and return to 
the water to harden; then remove the casting care- 
fully from the mold. 

A preparation of even parts of wax and mutton 
tallow is used for molding flowers and small ob- 
jects by hand. The mixture is melted together 
and set to harden; the next day it is cut in fine 
shavings, which are worked in a cloth till soft and 
pliable. The flowers are formed by hand like the 
sugar flowers ( see No. 1143) . 

Small bunches of grass are imitated by press- 
ing green-colored fat through a sieve in small 
threads. 

Small blossoms and flowers are also made with 
lead forms which are cast in the shape of the 
flower; the form is fastened to a wire, the para- 
ffin and wax is melted and the form dipped first 
in the paraffin and then in iced water; it hardens 
immediately and can be taken out of the form. 
The center can be made with a paper cornet, with 
soft tallow. 

To use the fat for decorating with bag and tube: 
Melt two parts of mutton tallow with one part of 
lard, strain through a fine cloth into a basin and 
let cool; when it begins to set, beat with an egg- 
beater till white and light. 

To prepare the fat for large socles, take even 
parts of mutton tallow and leaf lard; free it from

1 149.— EGG PRESERVING 
There are many methods of preserving eggs, 
such as varnishing, or packing in dry salt, liming, 
and the water-glass method; but only the latter 
two have proved practical and satisfactory for 
general use. The old-time liming process is still 
considered by many the simplest, best and cheap- 
est method in use; while it is said the preserving 
of eggs in a water-glass solution keeps them even 
in a better condition than the lime and salt mix- 
ture, with only a slight increase of cost.

wholesale druggist, is simply mixed -vith water 
which has been previously boiled and cooled to 
normal temperature, in proportion of one pound 
of water-glass to ten pounds of water. 

For use: the eggs are simply taken from the 
solution by hand and dried before using. Eggs 
thus preserved should be kept in a dark cool place, 
and wiU keep for eight months and more. 



pot of boiling water and boil for tw; hours. 
Serve with a hot syrup sauce flavored with plenty 
of good rum. 

1 131.— THE USE OF GLUCOSE IN PRE- 
SERVING OF FRUIT. 

Sugar after it reaches the blow degree in boil- 
ing readily crystalizes, and for this reason a cer- 
tain quantity of acid is added if this is not desired. 
This acid transforms the sugar into uncrystaliz- 
able sugar. 

The same result is obtained by adding glucose 
to the sugar. Glucose, or com sugar, is inverted 
sugar, only it contains less sweetening properties. 



X4° 



PAUL RICHARDS BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES ANE SWEETMEATS. 



One part of sugar is said to sweeten as much as two 
and one-half parts of glucose. By using one-third 
part of glucose with two-thirds of sugar, a more 
acceptable preserve of less sweetness may be ob- 
tained, with a. better flavor of the fruit. 

1152.— TO PRESERVE CITRON. 

Cut fresh citron, remove the seeds and keep in 
cold water for three days, changing the water 
every day; or place in running water. 

Much citron and orange peel is imported in salt 
brine of about twelve per cent, in strength; if 
this citron is used, wash it in water till all the salt 
is removed. 

Blanch the fresh or pickled citron in clear 
water, by setting it on the fire and let simmer; 
keep it near the boiling point (but do not let it 
boil) till soft During the blanching process some 
green color may be added to give a nice color. 

When soft, place again in cold or running water 
to lose some of the bitter taste. Put the peel in 
jars and pour over a hot syrup made with three 
quarts of water and two pounds of sugar; or 
weigh the syrup to 16 degrees syrup-scale. Let 
the syrup remain in the peel for two days. Drain 
and reboil the syrup and add more sugar to make 
20 degrees Baumd. After this time, drain the 
syrup every three days and increase the syrup 
every time two more degrees by adding more 
sugar till it reaches 32 degrees B. The citron or 
peel should be fully candied by this time, and may 
be left in the syrup for use; but if you want to 
glace it, take it from the syrup and wipe dry with 
a moist sponge, and set to dry on a wire grate. 

When dry, take five pounds of sugar and one 
quart of water, boil to the blow degree, and drop 
in the peel; let boil for one minute; take out the 
peel with a fork and drain on a wire grate; then 
set in the dry closet till all the moisture has 
evaporated. 

1153.— SALTED ALMONDS. 
DEVILED ALMONDS. 

Blanch and dry sweet almonds and brown to a 
fawn color. Put a pat of butter on a pan and let 
brown, add the hot almonds, shake well together 
and place in a sieve. Sprinkle with fine table salt 
and let cool. 

Another method of salting almonds is to fry the 
dry almonds in fresh butter till brown; then drain 
and sprinkle with salt. 

Another mode, is to roast the almonds to a nice 
brown, then moisten them with gum water and 
sprinkle with fine salt. 

DEVILED ALMONDS are made by adding 
a dash of cayenne pepper with the salt. 

1154.— SALTED PEANUTS. 
Roast the peanuts and rub off the brown cover- 



ing. Finish same way as for salted almonds No. 
1153. The peanuts may also be blanched before 
roasting. 

1155.— S/J TED CHESTNUTS. 
Make a cross incision on the shell of the nuts; 
roast and peel; or boil in water and remove the 
peel and thin skin. Fry in butter and salt same 
way as for salted almonds No. 1153. 

1 156.— STUFFED DATES. 
Select choice dates and remove the seed; fill 
the opening with half a walnut or pecan-nut; or 
make a roll of cream fondant and use for filling. 

1137.— TO CLEAN RAISINS and CURRANTS. 

Place them in a coarse sieve and rub with a 
little flour to break oS the stems; after this take 
them on the table, with one hand push aside the 
raisins, with the other hand the loosened stems 
and gravel. 

Currants require washing. Place the currants 
in a sieve and set the sieve in a pan of water; 
soak and wash, changing the water till i t remains 
clear; the sand will fall throngh the sieve into the 
pan. Let the currants dry, and pick over care- 
fully to remove the pieces of gravel which have 
not been removed in the water. 

1158.— COCOANUT ICE OR SHERBET. 

Take the grated meat and milk of two fresh 
cocoanuts; add three quarts of water and let 
slowly come to a boil; set aside and let simmer 
for fifteen minutes; place in a stone jar and let 
cool When about luke-warm, strain through a 
clean towel and add two pounds of sugar, stir till 
dissolved and add two or three beaten egg whites. 
Freeze as usual. 

Desiccated cocoanut may be used if fresh 
cocoanut cannot be had. Take four to six ounces 
of the cocoanut to each quart of water and let 
simmer on the fire for fifteen minutes; cool and 
strain. Add for each quart, eight ounces of sugar 
and one white of egg, and freeze. 

The juice of some lemons or oranges may be 
added; also the flavor of orange flower water or 
vanilla extract. 

1139.— SPAGHETTI PUDDING. 
MACARONI PUDDING. 

Break one pound of spaghetti in one-inch pieces, 
put in a pan and pour over one quart and one pint 
of boiling milk; let simmer slowly till soft. Take 
off the fire and add four ounces of butter and six 
ounces of sugar and mix together; let cool. 

Then add twelve eggs: Separate the yolks and 
mix with four ounces of chopped almonds. Beat 
the whites firm and draw in carefully. Add a 
pinch of mace and half a grated lemon rind and 
bake in buttered mold. Serve with cream sauce. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OP BRKADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES A*ND SWEETMEATS. 



141 



MACARONI PUDDING may be made in the 
same manner. 

1160.— CRUMB GRIDDLE CAKE. 

To use left over stale bread : Soak the bread in 
soar milk over night. For each pound of bread 
take one quart of milk. In the morning rub 
through a sieve or colander, add four eggs, one 
ounce of melted butter, and two teaspoonfuls of 
soda dissolved in water, add a little flour or corn- 
meal to make it like ordinary griddle cakes. 

Another way is to grate the bread, or trim off 
the crust, and soak it in milk or water; add to 
each pound of it, eight ounces of flour sifted with 
one teaspoonful of baking powder; add three 
eggs, a little melted butter, salt, and more milk to 
make a smooth batter, and bake like other griddle 
cakes. 

1161.— ENGLISH CARROT PUDDING. 

One pound of grated carrots, twelve ounces of 
finely-chopped suet, one pound of raisins, one 
pound of currants, one pound of boiled potatoes 
(grated when cold), one pound of brown sugar, 
one pound and eight ounces of flour, one tea- 
spoonful of soda, a little salt. 

Mix all the ingredients together dry. Steam or 
boil in cloth for three hours. 

When done, take from the cloth; put in the 
oven to brown and bake for twenty minutes. 
Serve with wine sauce. 

1162— USE OF CONDENSED CREAM 
AND MILK. 

For ice cream, use even quantities of condensed 
cream and water. To each gallon of the mixed 
cream and water add one pound and twelve ounces 
of sugar; heat and let cool. Flavor and freeze as 
usual. 

Condensed milk contains sugar; to use it, dilute 
one part of the milk with two parts of boiling 
water, let cool, flavor and freeze. 

For richer creams the yolks of eggs may be 
added in the same manner as for other ice creams. 

If fresh milk can be used with the condensed 
cream or milk in place of water, it will make a 
still richer mixture. 

Condensed milk diluted with three parts of hot 
water may be used for puddings, custard, and 
cream cake fillings. 

1163.— PIE A LA MODE. 

This name appears sometimes on bills-of-fare. 
A slice of fruit pie, (generally apple pie), is 
served with a spoonful of ice cream on top, or on 
the side. 
1164.— CAKE BAKING in HIGH ALTITUDES. 

Bakers not used to work in high altitudes always 
experience some difiSculty in using the general 



recipes. Yeast works more vigorously in sponge 
and doughs, makes them come faster. But the 
most difficulty is with ^he cake mixtures. The 
ordinary mixtures rise too much in baking, and 
fall like as if there was too much baking powder 
in it During the time I worked in Denver^ 
Colorado, I had trouble with my own recipes. I 
learned to overcome the difficulty by comparing 
the recipes used there by other bakers. The 
amount of sugar in these receipes had been 
reduced two, three, and in some recipes nearly 
four ounces. Some recipes contained more flour, 
and the raising material, baking powder or am- 
monia, was about half, and in some mixtures one- 
third less than in the Eastern mixtures. 

The remedy is to reduce the sugar two or three 
ounces each pound in all the mixtures, and reduce 
the -raising material to one-half or one-third of 
the usual amount. 

1165.— THE USE OF LIME WATER IN 
BAKING. 

Lime water has been used for years to improve 
weak flours and correct flours which have got 
damp in the package and become musty. It is 
also used in flours which run in the dough, caused 
by unripe and sprouted wheat. 

This lime water is made by taking one pound of 
fresh slaked lime and mix it well with one pail 
(twelve quarts ) of water; let it settle and draw 
off the clear liquid without disturbing the sedi- 
ment on the bottom. Use from one to two quarts 
of this liquid to each ten quarts of dough. 

Do not use the lime water in the sponge. Set 
the sponge with a little more yeast than usual, and 
when the sponge is ready, use the lime water and 
more water for doughing. The lime water checks 
fermentation, that is the reason why it should not 
be used in the sponge. 

It is said that some physicians advise the use of 
lime water in breads as an aid to digestion, 

1166.— OATMEAL CAKE. 

Mix one pound of oatmeal with one pint of 
buttermilk and let soak over night. In the morn- 
ing dissolve a small teaspoonful of soda in a little 
water with a pinch of salt; mix and add more 
meal, if required, to make a firm paste. Form 
in flat thin cakes the size and thickness of 
griddle cakes, and bake on a pan in a medium 
hot oven. 

Some shortening in form of butter or lard 
may be added, and water or sweet milk can be 
used. 

The stone ground meal is preferable for these 
cakes. It makes a better cake than flaked or 
rolled oatmeal.

IN 



1167. — TO PRESERVE RHUBARB 
WATER. 

The young tender sttJVs require no peeling; 
otherwise peel off the outer sk'n, cut in small 
pieces, and fill in jars. Fill jars with fresh cold 
water, close the jars, steam or boil for fifteen 
minutes. 

1168.— TO PRESERVE OTHER FRUIT IN 
WATER. 

The fruits are bottled, covered with fresh boiled 
water; then the jars or cans are closed airtight 
and steamed, or kept in boiling water till the heat 
penetrates and preserves the fruit. 

This process sterilizes but does not cook the 
fruit. 

The time to STERILIZE the FRUITS is given: 

For small fruit with stones: for quarts, ten 
minutes; pints, eight minutes; 

For large fruit with stones: for quarts, twelve 
minutes; for pints, ten minutes. 

For pitted fruits, as pears, half peaches and 
apricots: for quarts, eight minutes; for pints, six 
minutes. 

1169.— BRANDY PEACHES. 
BRANDY CHERRIES. 
BRANDY PLUMS. 
AND OTHER FRUIT. 
Take medium ripe fruit. 

Wash and prick peaches or plums with a silver 
fork and put in stone jars. 

Pour over a hot syrup, made with two quarts 
of water and two pounds of sugar. The next 
day, drain off the syrup, reboil, add eight ounces 
more of sugar, and leave on the fruit for three 
days. 

Drain the syrup from the fruit; put the fruit in 
bottles and cover with a. syrup of thirty-two de- 
grees. Add to each pint of the syrup one quart 
of proof spirits and put on the covers. A syrup 
of this density may be made with one quart of 
water and two pounds and twelve ounces of sugar. 

1 170.— ANOTHER WAY TO PRESERVE 
PEACHES IN WATER. 

Take medium ripe peaches, prick each one 
several times with a silver fork, put on the fire in 
cold water and let come near a boil. Do not let 
boil, but simmer slowly till they can be pierced 
with a straw; then fill into bottles or jars with 
boiling water and close up tight. 

1171.— EXTRACTS OF NOYEAU. 
CREME DE NOYEAU. 
Cover stones and pits of peaches, plums and 
cherries with proof spirits from two to three weeks, 
and filter. 



To make Creme de Noyeau, take one pint of 
spirits to one pint of syrup at thirty-two degrees. 

1172.— MARASCHINO EXTRACT. 
Take one pint of the Noyeau Extract No. 1171, 
two ounces of orange flower water, four ounces of 
raspberry extract, one quart of syrup, and half a 
pint of spirits. 

1173.— REMEDIES AGAINST ANTS IN 
BAKERIES. 

Ants are very fond of sugar and often become 
a great nuisance in the bakery. 

One of the common remedies is to set the legs 
of the tables in cans of water. 

Another remedy is to scald or bum the ants 
frequently. 

Another remedy is to soak a sponge with a thin 
syrup, which attracts the ants, then put the 
sponge in boiling water. 

Ants are fond of lard; it is said that a mixture of 
sixty grains of corrosive chloride of mercury with 
one ounce of lard is certain death to all insects. 
Some of this poisoned grease put in crevices or 
in a ring on the legs of tables will be a complete 
protection. Ants cannot cross the grease and live. 
In mixing avoid getting it on the hands, and do 
not place or leave any of the poison where it may 
result in harm. 

1174.— REMEDY FOR RED ANTS. 
Use eight ounces of aqua ammonia mixed with 
one ounce of creosote, and sprinkle it around 
where the ants appear. 

1175 —RYE BREAD AS A WALL PAPER 
CLEANER. 

In some hotels rye bread is used to clean ex- 
pensive wall paper. 

Bake round loaves of the bread; do not give 
much proof in baking. When the bread is baked 
and while still warm, cut each loaf in four pieces, 
crosswise, pull out the soft crumb in one piece 
and press and form into a firm cone or ball. The 
paper is rubbed with this paste. The paste is 
moist but does not stick to the paper; but cleanses 
it effectively. 

Another wall paper cleaner which has been used 
in the old Richelieu Hotel, Chicago, is known by 
the name of DR. EWELL'S WALL-PAPER 
CLEANER. 

Dissolve one tablespoonful of blue vitriol in one 
pint of boiling water; while boiling, stir in suffi- 
cient winter wheat flour to make a firm paste. 
Then mix and work into it by kneading, two 
spoonfuls of pearline, one spoonful of glycerine, 
two spoonfuls of oil of sassafras.

BREAD ECONOMIES IN THE HOTEL. 

In the modem hotel o£ to-day, everything is 
arranged with a view to the greatest economy, 
and every detail is closely looked after to reduce 
expenses and prevent waste One of the problems 
which come before hotel men is, how to reduce 
the waste of bread. 

In large hotels this waste often amounts to two 
or three barrelfuls or bagfuls a day. It consists 
of left-over and broken rolls and mufSns, dry cuts 
of French bread, and for the most part, the trim- 
mings and ends of toast bread. 

Although much of the left-over bread is utilized Other hotels use single pans which are made to 
in the kitchen and help's dining room, sometimes hold one two-pound loaf. These pans are from 
it accumulates in such quantities that all of it twelve to eighteen inches long and about three

inches deep, narrow on the bottom and wide on 
the top. 

Bread baked in these open pans forms a round

cannot be used, and it is sold for very little, or 
given away for chicken or horse feed. 

As I said above, the largest part consists of 
trimmings and ends of toast bread. This part of 
the waste can be cut down to almost nothing, if 
the proper kind of pans are used for baking the 
toast bread in. 

Almost all the restaurants who buy their bread 
from the baker are using bread which is baked in 
covered pans; and some wide-awake hotel men 
also use covered pans (known as Pullman pans ) 
to bake the toast bread in. 

But in a majority of the hotels this is not the 
case. 

in most hotels the bread used for toast is baked 
m large square pans, about i8 x 25 x 3 inches, and 
five or six two-pound loaves are baked in one pan. 




NO WASTE OF BREAD WHEN BAKED IN COVERED PANS. 

top, the sides and ends contract, and a thick brown 
crust forms in baking. 

Bread toasts better when a day or two old. 
The loaves baked in the multiple pans are cut or 
often broken apart, and each loaf is cut in slices, 



144 PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



suitable for toast. From each end of the loaf one 
thick slice is cut ofi that goes into the waste bar- 
rel; and when the other slices are toasted they 
are trimmed square, and the brown top and bot- 
tom crust also goes in the waste barrel. 

One other drawback of bread baked like this 
is, that the crumb soon gets very dry, and in hot 
kitchens large cracks form in the center of the 
loaves, which makes it unfit to be cut in slices. 

Nearly all of this waste disappears if the bread 
is baked under cover, or in Pullman pans. 

The pans are called Pullman Bread Pans be- 
cause the bread used on dining cars and in many 
depots is baked in these pans. 

The pans are not a novelty. I have used pans 
like these twenty-five years ago in New 'iTork City 
at the old Sinclair Hotel. The proprietor, Mr. 
Ashman, had the pans made after his own design 
to prevent waste. 

The reason why these pans are not more in use, 
is (probably) because it is easier for the baker to 
use large open pans. Baking single loaves in 
closed pans makes more work in cleaning, greas- 
ing and handling the pans. But I think this is 
offset in the smaller amount he would have to 
bake. 

The size of the regular Pullman pan as used at 
depots, is ten inches long and about four and one- 
half inches square, with a sliding cover. This 
size makes a large square slice, which is especi- 
ally well suited for sandwiches. 

For hotels it would be more profitable to use 
two sizes of pans: a large size like above for club 
sandwiches and other purposes where a large slice 
is required; and a smaller size, about 3^ or 3^ 
inches square, for toast. Both sizes of pans could 
be from eighteen to twenty inches long. This size 
would reduce the waste of ends. 

The smaller size also makes a nice slice, if used 
for table bread. 

Breads like this, baked in covered pans, acquire 
a different taste. The crumb becomes moiater and 
retains its moisture longer. Only a very thin crust 
is formed in baking, and the flavor is like that of 
Vienna bread. 

The flavor and the thin crust makes this bread 
often more acceptable to patrons who do not like 
the hard-crusted French bread; and others would 
relish it for a change. 

Although thi3 French bread is the acknowledged 
table bread, the trend of the public inclines more 
and more to the thin soft-crusted breads, which 
are very popular in the ordinary restaurants. 

I am giving here some experiences which I had 
in some Southern resort hotels, in the hope that 
it may do some good. In one hotel we had the 
old-style pans, and were baking five two-pound 



loaves in one pan. I talked the matter over with 
the steward about getting covered pans; then it 
was laid before the proprietor. He saw the point 
at once, and ordered several dozen of the pans 
from a Cincinnati firm. 

Before we used these pans we had from five to 
six big potato-bagfuls of dry bread left over per 
week. This was given to a farmer, who furnished 
us with sawdust for use on the kitchen floor in 
return for the bread. After we had the pans in 
use for a week, not more than half of the former 
amount of bread was left over. 

The satisfaction was all around. The pantry- 
girl who had to cut the bread said: "It cuts 
much better : does not crumble like the other did. " 
The girl whp made the toast said: " The slices fit 
better in the toaster and it toasts better." And 
the waiters said: "It is much better, l)ecause we 
do not have to trim it after toasting." 

Sometimes we would run short of French bread, 
and we served some of the fresh baked loaves for 
dinner; after a while the waiters began to ask for 
this bread, because some of the patrons liked it 
better than the French bread. 

The buying of these pans was a very good in- 
vestment, and the cost was saved in a few months' 
time. 

As to the cost of the pans, we had two price 
lists to choose from. One firm quoted three sizes 
of pans at $3.60, $3.75 and $4.00 per dozen, and 
one firm only one size at seventy-five cents each. 
We paid $3.75 per dozen. The pans are made of 
heavy white tin, and have been in use now for 
several years. 

Wnite tin possesses this peculiarity: when new 
and bright, it repels heat. For this reason, for 
the first week, it is difficult to give the proper 
color to the crust in baking; but after the bright- 
ness wears of, the pans bake as well as pans made 
of black sheet steel or Russia iron. 

OTHER CAUSES OF "WASTE BREAD. 

It is the custom in many hotels to cut the bread 
before the meal starts, and each waiter carries as 
much of the cut bread to his station as he expects 
to use during the dinner. This method probably 
tends to quicker service; but, as is generally the 
case, the waiters carry in more than they actually 
require in order to save themselves an extra trip 
to the pantry; and, as it often happens, some of 
the expected patrons do not appear for dinner. 
The bread after standing for two hours in the 
dining room is carried back to the scrap table. 

All cut bread dries quickly; and I think it would 
be more pleasing to the patrons and more profit- 
able to hotelmen if each order of bread would be 
served freshly cut, with the other orders.

In some kitchens more of this left-over dry 
bread is used than in others. This depends 
mainly on the chef. 

At one other large Southern hotel, where I was 
employed several seasons, with different chefs, 
we had a very efficient chef, who is at present one 
of the best known stewards. While this chef 
presided over the kitchen there was very little 
bread wasted. Every day the left-over bread was 
carefully looked over, the brown crusts were trim- 
med ofC each slice, and put through a large bread- 
crumbing machine, run by power, and was made 
into crumbs. 

The crumbs were used for various purposes, 
but the largest part went into pork sausage and 
fricadelles for the help. We had nearly two 
hundred colored help, and pork sausage was one 
of the favorite dishes. The fresh pork was 
bought in the shape of whole pigs from the farm- 
ers. This chef kqew how to use it to the best 
advantage, and every particle of it was used. 
When one realizes that good ordinary pork sausage 



contains about fifty per cent, of soaked bread 
crumbs or cracker meal, one would think it would 
pay to make the sausage in the hotel, instead of 
paying the butcher for stale bread. 

In comparison with other chefs we had there 
other seasons, this chef saved in my department 
about one barrel of flour every week, and inci- 
dentally the work of making it into bread, not to 
speak of the other ingredients which go into good 
bread, besides saving money to the hoteil otherwise. 

One other cause which tends to a waste of bread 
is the idea that bread is an article of little value, 
because there are very few hotel men who know 
how much each loaf of bread costs them to pro- 
duce. This idea is shared by the employes. I 
have often heard the remark, ' ' O, bread is cheap, 
the loss don't amount to much." This is especi- 
ally so where the bread is baked in the hotel. In 
places where it is bought from the baker, it is 
more closely looked after, because the value of 
each loaf is known and charged to the department 
it is used in.

DANISH PASTRY AND BUTTER CREAMS 



Danish pastry is made of rich coffee cake 
dough, which was formerly known as yeast 
raised pufE paste, or as French, or Vienna 
coffee cake doughs. Of late years the pastry 
has become more widely known and made 
popular by the name of Danish pastry, and 
the methods of slow working doughs have 
been changed to more progressive methods, 
using a larger quantity of yeast, which permits 
the doughs to be made and the butter to be rolled 
in at once. The methods, however, vary in the 
different shops. The handling of this pastry is 
the same as when making other puff pastes ; the 
conditions must be favorable so that the goods 
can be made up in a cold place; the materials 
must be cold, and handled in a temperature which 
prevents the butter from melting. After the 
goods have been placed in pans, they may be 
placed in a warmer temperature, given time to 
expand before baking. The flour should be a 
blend of from 2/3 to % of a good hard wheat 
flour (bread flour) with from Vs to % part of 
soft wheat flour (pastry flour). The butter 
should be dry and flexible, and of the same con- 
sistency as the dough. A most favorable tem- 
perature of handling these doughs is given as 
between 50 and 55 degrees, Fahr. In some 
bakeries it is the custom to rhake the basic dough 
in the evening, and roll in the butter in the morn- 
ing. In other places the dough is made ready 
and given two turns in the evening, kept in the 
ice box over night, and worked up in the morning ; 
or the dough is made up and worked at once, 
giving it only a little time to recover. 

1: Danish Pastry Dough: Flour, 7^2 to 8 
pounds; cold milk, 2 quarts; sugar, l^i pounds; 
butter, 5 to 6 pounds, (Amount may he varied ac- 
cording to richness of dough desired) ; yeast, 8 
ounces; eggs, % pint yolks, 1/2 pint whole eggs; 
flavor with the grated rind of two lemons; a little 
ground mace. 

2: Swedish Pastry Dough: 2 quarts half 
milk half water; 5 to 10 eggs; 8 ounces yeast; 
12 ounces sugar; 12 ounces lard; 2 pounds but- 
ter ; iy2, to 8 pounds flour ; flavor with lemon rind 
and mace. 

METHOD OF WOEKING: Make a fairly 
stiff dough of the consistency of cold firm butter; 
dissolve the yeast in the milk. For No. 1, cream 
sugar, 1 pound of butter light with egg's. For No. 
2, cream sugar and lard with eggs. Add flour 
and make a smooth dough. Divide the dough in 
two pieces, form a square and set in the ice box, 
covered, to rest for half an hour. Then place 
dough on flour dusted table and roll each piece 
out to about Vs-inch in thickness, forming an 
oblong three times as long as wide. For No. 1, 
divide 2 to 2^! pounds butter. For No. 2, 1 
pound of butter over 2/3 of the dough evenly in 
small pals. Smooth the butter, and fold % part 



of the dough left bare over half the butter; then 
fold the buttered third over on top. This forms a 
square of three layers of dough with two layers 
of butter in the center. 

Now give one more rolling to % inch of thick- 
ness, and fold in three. Let rest, covered, for 
half an hour and give one more turn. This is the 
same method as used for puff pastes, only less 
turns or foldings are given. The dough is now 
ready to be worked up in the various shapes 
desired, set on pans, and allowed to rest from 20 
to 30 minutes to gain some volume, after which 
the goods are washed, sprinkled with nuts or 
almonds, or filled with cream or jam and baked, 
and further finished with icings and butter 
creams for decoration. 

OTHER METHODS OF HANDLING are to 
make the dough as given in the evening, and fin- 
ish by rolling in the butter in the morning; or 
making the dough and rolling in the butter in the 
evening, giving it two turns and leaving in the 
ice box over night, and give only one folding in 
the morning. 

The Swedish pastry dough is usually made and 
worked up at once after giving dough a little 
time to prove, or from 20 to 30 minutes. The 
butter is then rolled in, and the dough is worked 
up at once. This dough, being less rich in butter, 
is well suited for lunch rooms and restaurant, 
the work being quickly made, and may be worked 
up in large portion pieces, such as crescents, 
snails, pretzels and squares, to sell for five or ten 
cents each, the size according to price. The dough 
may also be made up in large filled rolls, proved 
and baked, iced and sold in cuts. With different 
fillings and shapes quite a variety of goods can 
be produced, all of which will prove good sellers. 

Working Up Ready Made Doughs 
Roll out a sheet of dough to about % inch 
thickness, cut up in strips six inches wide, and 
cut this again in one-inch wide strips ; twist these 
strips, and make up into coils or snails, pret- 
zels, or scrolls ; set on pans, place a dot of good 
jam in the center of each coil or scroll, place a 
dot of cream custard over, let rest 20 to 30 min- 
utes and bake. These may be covered with icing, 
and a cherry in center of icing. 

Filled Crescents 

Roll dough and cut in three-ounce triangles, 
oblongs ; spread some almond or nut cream over, 
or cover with jam and sprinkle with chopped 
nuts. Roll dough up as for crescents, set on 
pans, %g^ wash, sprinkle chopped nuts on top ; 
let rest 20 minutes, then bake. They may be left 
plain, or covered with butt«r cream and rolled in 
chopped nuts. 

Other effects may be made by filling a long 
strip of dough, dividing, and cutting in six-inch

strips; set these in horseshoe shape on the pans, 
wash and bake, and decorate with butter cream. 

Swedish Butter Roll 

Roll dough out after giving two turns, sprinkle 
with cinnamon sugar and ground nut meats, 
double over, and roll into sheet % inch thick; 
cut into three-inch wide strips, and cut the strips 
into three-inch squares. This can be done in the 
ordinary shop temperature of 80 degrees if 
dough is cool. Fold each comer of the square 
to the center, and press down well. Set on pans, 
about 25 of this size to a pan 18x25x1 inch ; egg 
wash, let prove to double size, put a dot of pastry 
cream in the center, give only medium proof, and 
bake in fairly good heat. "When baked put dot 
of icing on the cream. The shapes and sizes may 
be varied in many ways and the filling changed. 
In fact there is no limit to the variations. 

It must be borne in mind that goods of high 
quality can only be made of the best materials. 
The rich pastry doughs, containing large amounts 
of butter should be baked as soon as recovered 
on the pans to have the appearance of good leafy 
and crisp pastry. The less rich doughs may be 
given more time on the pans to produce a larger 
lighter article. Any pastry cook used to han- 
dling puff pastes, the making of which is fully 
explained in all of my pastry books, will find no 
difficulty in making Danish pastry. The same 
shapes as used for turnover fancy rolls, and 
twists with puff paste, also will work nicely when 
using the yeast raised puff pastes given. 

Fillings foe Pastries 

Quite a variety of fillings for pastries are given 
in "Pastry for the Restaurant," pages 41 to 45 ; 
in "Paul Richards' Pastry Book," pages 2 to 4, 
and 14 to 15, and in the "Lunch Room Book" 
pages 30 to 34. Fruit jams of all kinds, pastry 
creams, etc., are popular. The various icings and 
butter creams are used for decorating the baked 
cakes, which are often finished with candied 
fruits, and in many other ways. In making up 
fillings it is economical to use good cake crumbs, 
broken or stale macaroons, which may be mixed 
with the various ground or chopped nut meats, or 
jams, and sufficient moisture in a soft spread- 
ing paste. 

Almond Filling — Nut Filling 

No. 1: 1 pound roasted filberts, or gTonnd 
walnuts; 2 pounds sugar; 1 pound cake crumbs; 
1 teaspoonful cinnamon; 5 eggs, and sufficient

Butter cream being very much used for filling 
pastries, especially French pastries, and other 
large tart cakes, is also used for decorating, and 
the formulas are varied in many ways. It may 
be made up in one large batch, divided, colored, 
and flavored, and kept on hand in cool place for 
use.

RAISIN BREAD AND HEALTH BREAD 



A buyer of Paul Richards' books asks for 
some recipes for Raisin Breads, which he is 
unable to find in the books; because when the 
books were written, raisins in bread Avere veiy 
little used. 

In recent years raisins as well as prunes have 
been very much advertised, and many kinds of 
fruit breads have become popular and are in 
good demand. 

Seeded raisins and seedless raisins are used 
in various proportions. 

For use in breads seeded raisins are best sep- 
arated by breaking the package, placing the 
raisins on a baking pan, and set in the oven for 
a minute to heat. This facilitates the separat- 
ing. Another way is to moisten them with a 
little water. 

When dry, seedless raisins are used, they 
should be covered with water for a couple of 
hours, and the water drained off before using. 

The adding of the raisins to the dough is best 
done shortly before the dough is fully mixed. 



APPENDIX 



171 



If added too early the fruit is liable to break 
and cause the breads to have a streaky looking 
texture. 

In many bakeries it is the custom, where only 
a small quantity of this bread is required, to 
simply work from IV2 to 2 pounds of raisins in 
twenty to twenty-five pounds of plain bun 
dough. 

Quite a good many bakeries make special 
raisin breads, and also use fine cut figs, prunes, 
or combinations of fruits and chopped walnuts 
or pecans in these breads. 

A number of these raisin or fruit breads are 
made with so-called Health Flours, consisting 
of whole wheat meal, or a combination of sev- 
eral flours or meals. Some of them have bran 
added. These breads make a pleasing specialty 
where a change in diet is appreciated. 

To make a good whole wheat bread and add- 
ing raisins, it is necessary to have the whole 
wheat meal or flour milled from high grade hard 
winter wheat, or good Northern or Canadian 
hard spring wheat. Quite a number of mills 
grind special strong wheat meals and whole 
wheat flours, and some bakers buy the hard 
Canadian spring wheat and grind it into a 
coarse meal, using the same grinder that is used 
for coffee, which makes a fine gritty meal. 

Graham flours should practically contain the 
whole of the wheat ; but these flours vary greatly 
in strength. Some of them are milled from vei-y 
soft wheat. Some of them are composed of 
bran and offal of soft wheat, and are mixed with 
soft wheat flours. These flours require a large 
addition of good hard wheat flour to make good 
bread. 

To make a Special Raisin Bread : 

1— ONE GALLON BATCH RAISIN BREAD, 
STRAIGHT DOUGH 

14 to 14% pounds white bread flour 

1 gallon water, or part milk 

5 to 6 ounces of yeast 

2y2 to 3 ounces salt. 

8 ounces of sugar 

4 to 6 ounces shortening 
■ Erom 1 to 2 pounds of raisins. 

Method of Mixing: Dissolve the yeast in 1 
quart of water; dissolve salt and sugar in bal- 
ance of water, having the water of a temperature 
to have the dough about 80 degrees Fahr. when 
mixed. Add the flour and partly mix. Add the 
yeast solution, mix a minute, then add the short- 
ening. When dough is nearly mixed add the 
raisins and mix smooth to distribute the raisins 
evenly. Let the dough rise until light enough to 
recede when fingers are pushed in and with- 
drawn. Punch down and fold in sides and ends. 
Cover and let rise again to same height, fold over 
again, let rise once more about half way up, 
then divide into loaves. Give only short proof 
(let loaves double in size in pan) and bake as 
usual. 



2.— RAISIN BREAD, SPONGE AND 
DOUGH PROCESS 

1 gallon water 
% gallon milk 
3^2 ounces salt 

4 to 5 ounces yeast 
1% pounds sugar 

1 to V/z pounds shortening 
3 to 5 pounds raisins 

21 pounds flour (approximately). 

For this bread from 5 to 10 eggs or one pint 
of yolks may be added if desired. 

Set sponge with one gallon water, yeast and 
ten pounds of flour. Add the balance of in- 
gredients for doughing and work as in the pre- 
ceding formula. Set sponge at 82 degrees; 
dough at 80 degTees. Let dough come up once 
fully, then let come up twice only half, and 
work up. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD WITH RAISINS 

1% pounds white bread flour. 
1% pounds graham flour. 
1% pounds cornmeal. 
IV2 pounds rye flour. 

2 quarts molasses. 
1 quart water. 

1 quart milk. 

1 pound small raisins. 
% ounce salt. 

3 ounces baking powder. 

Mix all the dry ingredients, sifting the bak- 
ing powder in the white flour. Add molasses 
mixed with milk and water; last, add raisins. 
Mix well and steam or bake in well greased tins 
from 2 to 2% hours. For baking, set tins on 
one heavy pan; cover with another pan, and 
bake in low temperature of 260 to 275 degrees 
Fahr. 

BRAN BREAD WITH RAISINS (ONE 
GALLON BATCH)* 

For flour blend take 

6 pounds white bread flour 

5 pounds whole wheat flour 

2 pounds wheat bran 
1 pound potato flour 

Work like Batch No. 1, using ingredients as 
given, and handle dough in the same way. 

WHOLE MEAL RAISIN BREAD* 
Use 14 pounds strong whole wheat meal; or, 
if flour appears weak, add flve pounds hard 
spring wheat bread flour, leaving out a propor- 
tionate amount of the meal. 

WHOLE WHEAT AND WHITE BREAD 
WITH RAISINS* 

Take half whole wheat flour, or two-thirds 
whole wheat and from one-third to a half white 
bread flour to make up 14 to 14% pounds flour. 



172 



APPENDIX 



mjT BEEAD COMBINATION* 

Take 9 pounds good white bread flour 

2% pounds wheat meal 

21/2 pounds pure rye flour 

Use ingredients as given for No. 1, with from 
8 to 12 ounces of coarsely chopped nuts and 
one pound of small raisins. 

From the formula given a very good plain 
health bread can be made without the raisins; 
and another variety can be made using from 12 
ounces to one pound of honey in place of the 
sugar in No. 1, or 1% pint honey in No. 2, 
which would make a Plain, or Raisin Bread with 
Honey. 

As the darker grades of flour ferment and 
ripen more quickly than the white bread flours, 
the fermentation must be closely watched, and 
the doughs handled cool and young, and breads 
must not be given high proof in the pans before 
baking to make a good well flavored bread. 

*P. S. — The various combinations of flours, 
bran, whole meal, whole wheat, and nut bread, 
all to be used like No. 1, leaving out the 14 to 
14% pounds white flour. 



Taboo Use of Word Glucose 

W. p. Cutler, secretary of the "American 
Manufacturers' Association of Products from 
Com," calls attention to the word "glucose" as 
used indiscriminately by the authors of cook 
books, and submits the following for future 
guidance of said authors: 
* • » 

I trust you will pardon me, for calling your 
attention to the fact that the word "glucose" is 
no longer recognized, as a proper characteriza- 
tion for a combination of dextrose-glucose, dex- 
trine, and maltose, resulting from the manufac- 
ture of syrup from the starch of com. 

All legal authorities now use the term "Corn 



Syrup" in accordance with the following defini- 
tion: 

"Washington, D. C, February 13, 1908. 

"We have each given careful consideration 
to labeling, under the pure food law, of the 
thick viscous syrup obtained by incomplete 
hydrolysis of the starch of corn, and composed 
essentially of dextrose, maltose and dextrine. 

"In our opinion it is lawful to label this 
syrup as 'Corn Syrup'; and if to the corn 
syrup there is added, a small percentage of 
refiners' syrup, a product of the cane, the 
mixture, in our judgment, is not misbranded 
if labeled 'Com Syrup with Cane Flavor.' 

"George B. Coeteltou, Secretary of the 

Treasury. 
"James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture. 

"Oscar S. Steaus, Secretary of Commerce 
and Labor." 

The reason for this definition was that the 
word "glucose" being in effect "dextrose" could 
not properly be applied to a combination of 
dextrose-glucose, dextrine, and maltose, for the 
further reason that it was one ingredient and the 
law requires that no combination of ingredients 
can be named for one of the ingredients. 

Furthermore it has been found that the word 
"glucose" carries with it a prejudice on the part 
of the consumer, who does not understand what 
it really is. 

Not very long since the writer found a country 
physician, objecting to candy containing "glu- 
cose" as he called it, believing as it was made 
from glue, would gum up the kidneys. 

You will see from this, how misleading is the 
word "glucose" and I trust that you will in the 
future see your way clear to use the word "Corn 
Syrup" where you have hitherto used the word 
"glucose" — especially in any of your publica- 
tions.

The Epicurean 

By Ghas. Ranhofer

Room, Pantry, Storeroom, and Beverage Room 

The opening chapter is on "Table Service," and leads off with the arrangement of the bill of fare, 
followed with a chapter on wines, including a list of the different wines appropriate for the different 
courses, and the wines usually called for at dinners of Americans, Frenchmen and Germans, respectively. 
This is followed by a system of menu-compiling for course dinners ranging from 4 to 36 covers, and 
stating the time it should take to serve the dinners. 

How to lay and decorate the table; the seating of the host and guests; the fixing of the sideboard; the 
duties of the steward and waiters; dinner table etiquette, the manner of serving the different courses, 
including wines, and the windup with the tea service are cleverly explained. The French and Russian 
service are explained and a list is presented of the china, glassware, silver, etc., required for a dinner 
of twenty-four persons. Next comes valuable information regarding breakfasts, luncheons and suppers. 

Note the Diversity of the Contents 



There is a table of supplies in which is ^ven the French 
and English names of the foods and the time of year each 
is in season. This table includes "fish and shell fish," 
"poultry," "fruits," "game," "meats," and "vegetables." 
This is followed with a model market list to show at a 
glance quantities received, on hand, and needed.

Fare." These occupy 144 pages and present specimens for 
breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, buffet or standing suppers, 
collations, hunting parties, garden parties served ambtgue, 
sit down suppers, and dancing parties, including the re- 
freshments and supper. Every dish is numbered to corre- 
spond with a recipe for its preparation in another part of 
the book, the 3,715 recipes given being all represented in 
these bills of fare. 

Next comes a chapter on "Elementary Methods," in 
which is taught such information as how to peel almonds, 
to blanch vegetables, to make paste borders, to prepare 
bouchees, to braise, oread, carve, mold jellies, make vege- 
table colors, prepare different style creams, make puff paste,

make almond and many other pastes; press meats, gela- 
tines, breasts, sweetbreads, etc., prepare quenelles, clean 
currants, reduce and strain sauces, prepare rissoles, cut 
roots with a spoon and with a vegetable cutter; to prepare 
salpicon; to scald and sieve; the use of spices, aromatics 
and seasonings for cooking purposes; to cast and color 
stearine, to strain purees, cook sugar, make tarts; make 
thickenings for soups, sauces and stews; to line and bake 
timbale crusts, brush and peel truffles, dress, singe and 
truss poultry and game for entrees and roasting; make 
vol-au-vent crust, white stock for meats and vegetables, 
etc., etc., etc. 

Then follows a chapter on "Kitchen Utensils," in which 
about every known article of kitchen furniture and equip- 
ment (when the book was written) is described and illus- 
trated. This includes the cold storage department, as well. 
Next comes the department of "Soups," of which the mak- 



ing of two hundred kinds is explained. This is followed by 
"Sauces — Stocks, Essences and Auxiliaries," for which 251 
recioes are given. Following the sauces is a department 
of "garnishings," for which there are 133 recipes. Next 
is a chapter on "Side Dishes," in which recipes for 63 
cold and 158 hot are given. Then follows a chapter on 
"MoUusks and Crustaceans," with 101 recipes. A chapter 
on "Fish" comes next with 218 recipes. This is followed 
with chapters on "Beef," 165 recipes; "Veal," 165 recipes; 
"Mutton," 75 recipes; "Lamb," 109 recipes; "Pork,'*^ 48 
recipes; "Poultry," 224 lycipes; and "Game," 163 recipes. 
As yet we have got only about half way through the book. 
The next chapter is beaded "Miscellaneous Entrees," and 
gives 198 recipes. Next is a department of "Cold Service," 
including garnishings for cold dishes, the making of cooked 
salads, cooked and raw vegetable salads, green salads, etc* 
There are 267 recipes in this department. Following 
comes a chapter on Vegetables," with 172 recipes. Then 
one on "Eggs," with 100 different ways of cooking. Then 
comes a chapter headed "Farinaceous," with 37_ recipes. 
This is followed with "Sweet Entremets," of which there ' 
are recipes for 134 hot and 99 cold. 

We now come to the "Pastry," beginning with large 
cakes for entremets, 40 recipes; breakfast cakes, 19 reci- 
pes; small cakes for entremets. 52 recipes; tea cakes, 24 
recipes; and fancy cakes, 40 recipes.

gether with full information regarding utensils, yeast, fer- 
ment, leaves, etc., etc. 

Then follows a chapter on "Ices," including "Iced 
Drinks," with 189 recipes. Following this is a depart- 
ment of "Confectionery," with 90 recipes, including large 
?ieces, candies, preserves, salted almonds, cheeses and 
resh fruits, chocolate, coffees, raccahout, teas, etc. 

Then follows a very interesting chapter on "Wines," 
with information regarding the care of bottling, clarifying, 
decanting, and freezing; punches, dessert, drinks, etc. 

This is followed with a pictorial display of "last century" 
tables, and a "Collection of Delmonico*s Menus," occupy- 
ing 64 pages of the book. 

The volume ends with a comprehensive index occupying 
44 double column pages. 



The book is profusely illustrated — ^there being no less than 806 cuts interspersed among the 
reading matter. The pictures are very good of their kind, too. Another most excellent fea- 
ture of this great cook book is that every recipe in it appears under a good, honest English 
name, alongside of which is the translation of it into the French.

PREFACE 



TN this book I have endeavored, to the best of my ability, to tell how to 
make breads, cakes, pastries, ices, creams, and candies for the baker, 
pastry cook, and conf edkioner ambitious to do good work. My own success 
in this business is due to a careful study of the materials and to painstaking 
work covering a period of twenty-five years in places where good work was 
demanded. 

My objed in writing this book is to improve the standard of pastry work, 
and to raise the pastry cook to a higher plane by enabling him to command 
higher wages than have heretofore been customarily paid; also to elevate the 
bread and pastry cooking to the plane of high-class meat cooking. 

The making of the book has been a labor of love, and my earnest desire 
now is that the work shall bear fruit by popularizing, not alone the consump- 
tioQ of pastzy, bat also the profession of pastry making. 

Paul Richa2U38.

FRUIT JELLIES AND PRESERVES. 

Not many hotels make their own preserves and 
fmit jellies, and high prices are paid for these 
goods by hotelkeepers to get them first-class to 
please their patrons. 

The reason why preserving is not more prac- 
ticed is because the already preserved fmit can 
often be bought cheaper than it can be made in 
the hotels, for the reason that good table fruit al- 
ways commands a high price in large cities, while 
the manufacturers of preserves have plants right 
in the heart of the fruit growing districts and get 
the best fruit at half the price, consequently can 
put them up cheaper and profit by it. 

All fruit for preserving should be fresh and of 
uniform ripeness, therefore has to be carefully 
sorted to get good results. It is a mistake often 
made in hotels, trying to make good preserves out 
of fruit that is overripe and beginning to spoil, 
because the least speck of decay will be the cause 
of spoiling the whole batch. Only good sound 
fruit is fit for this purpose. 

For preserving on a small scale the common 
one- and two-quart glass jars are the best; for jell- 
ies the smaller glasses with tin covers do very well. 

After putting up, the fruits must be kept in cool 
dry places of even temperature, or in dark clos- 
ets, because light injures fruits just as much as 
heat does. If put up in glasses, wrap in paper; 
label, date and mark on it the cost price, so that 
it can be charged without much trouble to the 
department it is used in. 

The process by which the preserves known in 
the market as "candied fruits" or "fruits glaces" 
are made, is an art in itself, which can only be 
learned and mastered by long experience. These 
goods come mostly from Southern France. At- 
tempts are made in California in this line of pre- 
serving, but with very little success. The Cali- 
fornia fruits are hard and too much dried and 
cannot be compared with the French fruits glaces. 

The main thing to be done in this process is to 
extract the juice of the fruit and replace it with 
Augar, so it keeps its original form. The fruits, 
after being blanched, are put in a strong syrup of 
clarified sugar, left in it from ten to fourteen days. 



then symp and fruit is placed over the fire and 
heated to a certain degree, (just to the boiling 
point) skimmed and set aside lor ten days more, 
and put through the same process three or four 
times. When the fruit has taken up enough sugar 
it is taken out, washed in pure water and then fin- 
ished by dipping in a thick syrup and dried; after- 
ward it is packed in the light wooden boxes in 
which it is sold. 

The other preserves which come here (mostly 
in long white glasses as imported goods from 
Europe) are made by a similar process, which 
takes from three to five days and is as follows: 
Peaches, apricots, pears and quinces are peeled, 
cut in halves or quarters, the stones or seeds 
taken out, put in cold water to prevent losing 
color. A plated knife should be used for peeling 
and slicing (as steel is apt to discolor); and hard 
and green fruits should be softened in boiling 
water and put again in cold water. When this is 
finished the fruit is blanched, as it is termed; 
then begins the preserving. 

The fruit is taken out of the cold water, drained 
in a hair or cane sieve, put into boiling syrup and 
given two or three boils; then put in earthen pans 
and set aside till next day. The next day it is 
heated and the syrup drained oif. When the 
syrup is boiling add a little more sugar, put in the 
fruit and let come to a boil, then set aside till 
next day. On the third day the syrup is drained 
off again and more sugar added (because the 
sugar gets weakened by the fruit juice) and boiled 
to the soft ball, as it is termed; put in the fruit, 
let come to a boil, skim the syrup carefully, then 
take out the fruit and put in glasses, the hot 
syrup poured over and the glasses closed up air- 
tight. Peaches and apricots are finished in this 
way in three days, but pears and quinces take 
four and five days to get them clear and trans- 
parent. Watermelon rind (the white rind) if pre- 
pared in this way makes a nice preserve if some 
lemon or orange peel is added. Plums, cherries, 
strawberries and raspberries are prepared in the 
same way. 

There is another way of putting up fruit which 
takes less time and labor and is practiced in fam^

Take ripe berries, crush and rub through a fine 
sieve. With each pint of pulp mix two pounds of 
sugar; mix well together and fill into bottles. 
Cork, tie down and keep in cool place. 

27.— PRESERVING OF PIE FRUITS. 

Pie fruits require less sugar than is generally 
used in the richer preserves. For a medium 
sweet preserve use the sugar as given in the table 
below. For each quart of fruit use: 

Strawberries, 8 ounces of sugar. 

Raspberries, 6 ' 

Blackberries, 6 ' 

Blueberries, 6 ** " ** 

Gooseberries, 8 " '* " 

Cranberries, 10 " *' " 

Cherries, 8 " *' " 

Grapes, 8 ** '* 

Apples. 6 

Peaches, 6 

Quinces, 10 " " " 

Pears, 8 

Plums, 8 •' •• " 

Rhubarb, 12 

Prepare the fruit after the method as given in 
the general instructions at the beginning of these 
receipts, by either boiling in the syrup and filling 
into the glasses; or put the fruit in the glasses 
and fiU up with hot syrup. Set the jar in warm 
water with the cover on and boil till the fruit gets 
tender. Have the jars filled to the brim, remove 
from the water, put on the rubber, tighten the 
cover, then let cool and put away. 

Where fruit is used in large quantities, it may 
be put up in large jars which hold from one to 
ten gallons. Take jars with narrow necks, heat 
and scald well, and fill in the fruit right from the 
preserving kettle. Fill up to the neck. Put in 
over the fruit a brandied paper, then pour over a 
layer of melted paraffine and cover up. The jars 
should not be moved about very much as there is 
danger of loosening the paraffine cover by so doing. 
28.— COMPOTE OF FRUITS. 

The fruits are preserved in a light syrup and are 
put in bowls or jars for immediate use. Either 
fresh or dried fruit may be used for compotes. 
The dried fruits should be washed and soaked for 
several hours before stewing; and some fruit re- 
quire soaking over night. 

APPLES, PEARS. PEACHES and APRI- 



COTS are peeled and stewed or baked whole, 
cut in halves or slices and stewed till tender. 

CHERRIES are pitted or stewed whole. BER 
ries are picked over, washed and stewed whole. 
PLUMS and CHERRIES are often stewed with 
the stalks on them. The plums should be pricked 
all over with a pin to prevent the breaking of the 
skin. 

To preserve the whiteness of the fruits: AP^ 
PLES, QUINCES and PEARS, the peeled fruit, 
should be put in cold water before preserving. 
The skin of ripe PEACHES and APRICOTS is 
easily removed by dipping in boiling water for a 
moment. The green fruits should be peeled. 
For compotes the fruit should be stewed tenderi 
so as to keep whole and In shape. 

29.— COMPOTE OF WHOLE APPLES. 

Peel and core the apples. Put in flat sauce

BT.-SUGAR BOILING DEGREES. 

Sugar is boiled from 

Pearl to thread for syrup; 

Blow and feather for crystalization and con* 
serves; 

Ball, crack and caramel for candy and spun 
sugar work. 

It is divided into about sixteep different degrees, 
but without a certain standard for all, which is 
caused from the use of more or less glucose In the 
different recipes. The degrees can be ascertained 
by the use of the thermometer and also by the 
finger test. I give here eight of the degrees most 
generally used for syrups and candy making: 

DEGRESS OF THERMOMETER. 

Pearl and small thread, 2x8 to 220 degrees. 

Large thread - 

Blow - 

Softball - - 

Hard ball - 

Small crack 

Hard crack - 

Caramel - 

The FINGER test: Put five pounds of sugar 
to boil with one quart of water on a good fire in a 
copper basin, and let come to a boil. Take off 
with a skimmer the scum which rises. Then, 
with a wet sponge, wash down the sides to pre-

to the full spread of the fingers before it breaks. 

Blow degree: Dip the skimmer in the sugar 
and blow through the holes. If bubbles appear, 
it has reached the degree. 

Soft ball: To test the ball degree, take a 
pan with ice water. First dip the finger in the 
water, then in the sugar, and as quick as possible 
back in the water. (A stick may be used in place 
of the finger for this purpose). Try the sugar, 
and if it can be formed into a soft small ball it 
has reached the degree. 

Hard ball: A little more boiling, and by tha 
same test it will form a larger and harder ball. 

Small grace: The boiling is continued. Test 
again and press the sugar flat between the fing- 
ers; if it breaks, or bites hard and does not stick to 
the teeth, it has attained the proper degree. 

Hard grace: If the sugar breaks short and 
crisp with a snap, it has reached the degree. 

Caramel: In a few moments more the sugar 
will turn to a golden color, and this is the cara« 
mel degree. Take off the fire and turn out on 
the marble at once. 

A littie more boiling and the sugar begins to 
smoke, turn dark brown, then black and bum. 

At this stage it is used for coloring. Water is 
added and it is boiled into a syrup and put in 
botdes for use.

it is reduced to half a pint. Mix with half a gill 
alcohol, strain and bottle.

Green color can be made from the juice of spin- 
ach, by chopping and pressing the juice in a towel, 
and mixing with some syrup and a pinch of alum. 
But it is better and more practical to buy it from 
responsible dealers. 



73.-COLORED SUGAR. 

Colored sngar in the best form, Nompaxbil 
SuGAK, can be made only by the practical candy 
maker with machinery. But plain colored sugar 
may be made from coarse granulated sugxir. 

Sift the sugar to remove the fine grains, put in a 
shallow pan and add some desired color, mix well 
together, set in a warm place and stir till the sugar 
is dry. Put in bottles for use. 

Dessicated cocoanut, which is cut rather fine, 
can be shaded into the yarious colors, and dried 
like the sugar. 

Almonds may be blanched, cut, or chopped fine, 
and colored green and flavored with pistachio ex- 
tract, to represent pistachio nuts.

Dried fniit shoald be soaked in cold water from 
twelve to twenty-four hours before using, and 
then it should be stewed, sweetened and cooled 
before putting it in the pies. 

Tart fillings are made richer than the pie fill- 
ings and consist of rich preserves and creams, 
which are filled into the tarts and baked; and in 
some cases the tart shells are baked first and the 
filling is put in afterwards. 

While many of the fresh fruits may be used in 
the pies without previous cooking, some of the 
fruits require stewing before they can be used. 
75.— PUFF PASTE. 

Puff paste should not be made in very large 
batches, because this prevents perfect rolling. If 
large batches have to be made they should be 
divided into smaller batches of two or three 
pounds to the batch. The butter should be 
washed in cold water to remove the salt, and both 
butter and dough should be of the same consis- 
tency when the rolling commences. 

Take two pounds of good pastry flour, two 
pounds of well washed and firm butter, one scant 
pint of ice water, two yolks of eggs, one teaspoon- 
ful of cream tartar or one tablespoonful of vine- 
gar, a little salt. 

Rub four ounces of butter well into the flour, 
make a bay in the center of the flour, put in the 
yolks, vinegar, salt and water (leave out a little 
of the water, because the amount required is not 
always the same, it depends on the flour used). 
Mix into a smooth firm paste. Put the paste 
away to rest for fifteen minutes. 

Roll the dough out three times as long as it is 
wide, half an inch thick. Spread the butter over 
two-thirds of the dough evenly. Fold the 
part of the dough left bare over half of the 
butter, and the butter part on top of the dough. 
This forms a square of three layers of dough, 
with two layers of butter in the center. See that 
the sides of the dough enclose the butter all 
around, and begin the rolling. 

Dust the board well with dry spring flour and 
roll the paste carefully without much pressure in- 
to a long square one-quarter inch thick. Fold in 
three layers, and roll each, folding down evenly, 
and brush off the flour. 

Put the paste on a pan, cover with a cloth and 
aet in the ice box for half an hour. [The first 
part of folding the butter in the dough is not 
counted for a turn, but the last folding in three is 
termed one turn] . 

Roll the paste again as before and give two 
turns, (two times three foldings). Let rest again, 
and give three more turns, (six altogether). The 
flour should be brushed off before each folding to 
obtain a nice clear paste. 



When the paste is finished it should be given 
another rest before using. 

It is sometimes required to give one more torn 
to the paste, when the butter runs, and in baking, 
which happens mostly when the paste is made in 
large batches and has not been rolled thin enough 
before folding in three. 

Keep the puff paste covered up with a damp 
cloth or greased papers to prevent the drying of 
the paste, which would cause the breaking through 
of the butter. 

The rests between the rollings are given to pre- 
vent the paste from shrinking. If the rollings 
were continued without the intermissions, the 
flour paste would become tougher than the but- 
ter and shrink, and the butter would break 
through and spoil the paste. It is the even lay- 
ers of butter and dough which causes the paste 
to puff up high. The rest between the turns also 
prevents the butter from getting softer than the 
dough, and in summer it is often advisable to 
give a rest between each turn to prevent this. 

It the paste is prepared the day before using, 
omit the last one or two turns and finish half an 
hour before using. 

Puff paste may be made from a good tough but- 
terine, which is better than curdly butter; but 
the paste does not puff up so well as a paste made 
from good butter, and, of course, lacks the flavor 
of the butter. 

76.— QUICK PUFF PASTE 

One pound of cold butter; one pound of flour. 

Chop the butter into the flour in small lumps of 
about a quarter ounce each; sprinkle with ice water, 
just enough to hold together, and mix very light 
Put on the flour dusted table and press into a 
square shape; roll out half an inch thick and fold 
in three; give one more turn and give a rest; give 
three more turns, (five altogether) and it is ready 
for use. 

The same mixture may be made with the addi- 
tion of one ounce of baking powder. Mix the 
baking powder in some flour and dust it in be- 
tween the rollings. 

77.— THREE-QUARTER PUFF PASTE. 

A less expensive faste^ tuhich is suitable for 
tarts^ cream rolls and slices, and can be used 
for baked fruit rolls and dumplings. 

Take one pound of flour and rub in four ounces 
of lard; mix with cold water into a medium firm 
paste, but don't work it much. Take half a pound 
of butter, pliable and of the same consistency ai 
the dough, and roll it in the dough like Puff Paste, 
giving five turns only. 

78.— PIE PASTES. 

For pie paste the same rules hold good asgive< 
for Puff Paste. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWBBTMEAT8. 



Use good pastry floor (not a bread floor). 
Have all the ingredients cold, the batter and lard 
firm, and mix with iced water. 

Do not work the crust in mixing: shake it to- 
gether only, and sprinkle the water between so 
the shortening and flour will hold together. 

Dust the table, put oo the mixed paste and roll 
it into a sheet; fold into a square and put away for 
use. 

All lard may be used for economical reasons; 
but the use of some butter with the lard gives the 
best flavored crust. 

79.— PIE PASTE, TOP CRUST. 

Two pounds of flour, one pound of lard, half 
pound of butter. 

Have the shortening good and hard and the 
flour cold. 

Chop the shortening in the flour and mix with 
iced water to a medium firm dough as directed 
above, and set on ice to cool. 

For use, cut in pieces large enough for a pie 
covering when rolled out. 

If all lard is used, add a pinch of salt. 

[For a cheaper grade of pie top crust, ten ounces 
of lard may be used for each pound of flour.] 
80.— PIE PASTE. BOTTOM CRUST. 

Two pounds of flour, one pound of lard, a little 
salt. 

Rub the lard in the flour and mix lightly with 
cold water into a medium firm paste, working 
only enough so it holds together, and put away 
lor use. 

8x.— CUSTARD PIE PASTE. 

Three pounds of flour, eight ounces of batter, 
eight ounces of lard, one ounce of sugar, two yolks. 

Rub the butter in the flour, add the yolks and 
sugar and mix with milk or water into smooth paste. 
82.— SHORT PASTE FOR TARTS. 

Three pounds of flour, one pound of butter, six 
ounces of sugar, six yolks. 

Mix with milk, like the custard paste (No. 81). 
83— BOTTOM PASTE FOR LARGE CAKES 

AND LAYERS. 
r Two pounds of flour, one pound of butter, eight 
ounces of sugar, two eggs, half pint of water, a 
little powdered ammonia, the grated rind of one 
lemon. 

* Rub the flour with the butter as for pie dough. 
Dissolve the ammonia in the water, and mix eggs, 
water and sugar together. Beat it up well and 
mix with the flour and butter, (do not work the 
mixture much). Set in the ice box till wanted. 
84.— GERMAN SHORT PASTE. 

Take eight ounces of almond paste, eight 
ounces of flour, eight ounces of cake crumbs, six 
ounces of sugar, four ounces of butter, four eggs, 
the grated rind of one lemon, half a teaspoon of 



IX 

ground cloves and cinnamon, and a pinch of powd- 
ered ammonia. 

Rub the butter into the flour and mix with the 
sugar and the spices; soften the almond paste 
with the eggs; add the lemon rind and ammonia 
and mix all together into a smooth paste. Put 
away in a jar well covered in a cold place. 

85.— STEAMED DUMPLING PASTE. NO. x. 

Twenty-four ounces of flour, one ounce of 
baking powder, six ounces of butter, four eggs, 
two ounces of sugar, the grated rind of one lemon, 
a little mace, milk to mix. 

Work the ingredients same as for tea biscuit 
mixture, and use. 

86.— SUET DUMPLING PASTE, NO. 2. 

Two pounds of flour, one ounce of baking 
powder, eight ounces of finely chopped suet, two 
eggs,, pinch of salt, flavor. 

Mix with milk into a medium firm paste and use. 

One pound ol bread crumbs may be used, and 
only one pound of flour for this paste. 

87.— ROLLED DUMPLING PASTE, NO. 3. 

Twenty-four ounces of flour, eight ounces of 
butter, two eggs, the grated rind of one lemon, a 
little mace, pinch of salt, milk to mix, and one 
ounce of baking powder. 

Mix the baking powder with a handful of the 
flour and keep it back for dusting. Chop the but- 
ter in the rest of the flour and add the lemon 
rind, mace and salt. Mix the eggs with a little 
milk and sprinkle over the flour, then shake the 
mixture together same as for pie crust. Put on 
the table, dust with the flour and baking powder, 
roll out thin and give two turns (twice three fold- 
ings) like for Puff Paste (No. 75), then it is ready 
for use. All three pastes may be used for Meat 
Dumplings. 

88.— GUM-PASTE (PASTILLAGE). 

Put two ounces of gum tragacanth to soak in & 
cup of water, cover and let it stand in a warm 
place for about two days. When the gum has ab* 
sorbed all the water press it through a cloth. 
Mix on the marble slab with one pound of icing 
sugar and work smooth. Put away in a jar and 
cover with a damp cloth. 

If the paste is to be used for lozenges, work in 
two pounds of icing sugar, with flavor and color 
to suit. 

For ornamental work add starch powder in the 
same proportions in place of the sugar. This 
makes a nice pliable elastic paste which can 
easily be molded wivh the fingers into any shape, 
or pressed in molds for figure work, and may be^ 
colored any shade, it the paste is too firm it 
may be softened with even portions of starch and. 
water mixed together and added to the paste.

Usiog this paste requires quick work to prevent 
drying and crusting. 

89.— CROQUANT PASTE. 

This paste is mostly used for making orna- 
mental pieees. because it keeps its shape well if 
properly baked. The paste may be used to make 
baskets and also other ornaments which require a 
foundation. 

Take two pounds of flour, one pound of fine 
icing sugar, and two ounces of butter; rub all 
well together and work together with about nine 
or ten whites of eggs into a smooth but firm paste. 
Put away well covered in a cool place. 

90.— ALMOND PASTE (MARCIPAN). 

Take one pound and twelve ounces of blanched 
sweet almonds and four ounces bitter almonds; 
let them whiten in cold water over night. Wipe 
the almonds dry and pound in a mortar to a fine 
smooth paste. Add some water if too dry. Put 
the paste into a basin and stir with one pound of 
powdered sugar till it is smooth and does not stick 
to the finger. Take it off the fire and work in one 
or two pounds more of powdered sugar to form a 
pliable paste. It may be formed in small rolls or 
cut in stars and rmgs or any fancy shapes. They 
are baked in a medium heat to a nice golden 
brown color. 

If this paste is intended for ornamenting and 
for large pieces, one ounce of gum tragacanth 
may be added in solution while the paste is warm, 
and it may be worked like the Gum-paste (N0.88) . 
into baskets and croquant pieces. 

91.— MERINGUE PASTES. 

Meringue pastes are used in a variety of wa3r8 
in pastry and cake making. The soft meringues 
with less sugar are' used largely for pies and 
puddings. The hard meringues are baked on 
papers and pans; and others again on paper-cov^ 
ered boards. The menngue boards should be of 
non-resinous wood about one or two inches thick 
and cut so they can be put to soak m the smk be- 
fore using. These boards are used to bake mer- 
ingue shells for Easter eggs, and for baskets, etc. 

Meringues require a very cool oven: too much 
heat causes the paste to burst and color before it 
is sufficiently baked. 

ITALIAN MERINGUES are made with a 
syrup. The sugar is boiled to the blow degree, 
and poured hot in a thin stream into the beaten- 
up whites and then beaten cool. 

For the FRENCH MERINGUE, both sugar 
and whites are beaten together on a slow fire, 
warm till firm, and then beaten cold. 

These meringue pastes are used for the same 
purpose as the others, only with the difference 
that the hot pastes dry m less time than the 
pastes made by the cold process. 



92.— COLD MERINGUE PASTE. 

To obtain a good paste have the egg whites 
fresh and cold, the sugar dry and well sifted, the 
utensils (basin or kettle, and beater) perfectly 
clean and dry. 

A cold dry place is the most suitable for the 
beating. 

Beat slow at the start (do not stir) and increase 
the speed gradually. When the whites get firm 
add a small handful of the sugar and continue the 
beating till the mixture can be drawn to a point. 
Beat in another handful of the sugar and continue 
so till about one-third or one-fourth part of the 
sugar is beaten into the mixture. Add flavoring 
and mix in the rest of the sugar. Draw it in 
lightly, but avoid stirring too much, which would 
soften the paste and make it flow and run flat. 

The pastes may be colored to suit before all 
the sugar is beaten into the mixture. 

93.— MERINGUE PASTE, NO. x. 

One pint of whites of eggs, one pound and 
eight ounces powdered sugar or fine granulated 
sugar. Flavor. 

94.— MERINGUE PASTE, NO. a. 

One pint of whites of eggs, three pounds of 
powdered sugar. 

95.— ITALIAN MERINGUE PASTE. 

Boil one pound of granulated sugar with a lit- 
tle water to the blow degree. 

Beat the whites of six eggs firm. 

When the sugar has reached the degree, rub a 
part of it on the side of the kettle till it loses its 
clearness and begins to grain. Stir this in the 
other syrup and pour it in a thin stream into the 
whites, stirring constantly. Add the flavor and 
beat cold. 

This meringue is used much for ices and in 
punches. 

96— FRENCH MERINGUE PASTE, 

Two pounds of powdered sugar, one pint of 
whites of eggs. 

Put the sugar and whites together in a basin, 
and set in a pan with hot water, or on a slow fire, 
and beat the mixture till it stands up well. 'Take 
off the fire and beat cold for a minute and use like 
the other pastes. 

97.— CHARLOTTE RUSSE CRUST PASTE 
(YELLOW). 

One pint of whites of eggs, half pint of yolks, 
one pound of powdered sugar, one pound of flour, 
vanilla flavor, half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 

Retain a handful of the sugar to be beaten in 
the whites. 

Sift flour, sugar and cream of tartar together. 
Beat the whites to a firm froth, and beat in the 
retained sugar. Beat in the flavor and add the 
yolks gradually. Mix in the flour and sugar

The fillings can be made of more or less rich-

less eggs are used in the fillings, another thicken- 
ing must be substituted in the form of starch or 
flour. In this manner lemon pie and other cream 
fillings can be made with two or three yolks to 
the quart, instead o.! using six or eight yolks, us- 
ing more starch and a little more butter. Fruit 
fillings may also be i lade less expensive in this

than milk creams, which sour readily in summer.

PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKSS, PASTRIBS, ICBS AND SWBBTMBATS. 



Roll oat a very thin sheet of the paste, to one- 
sixteenth of an inch thickness. With a cutter a 
little larger than three inches diameter cnt out 
circulars and put on a wet baking sheet. Roll 
out another sheet of paste one-quarter inch thick- 
ness, and cut in three-inch circulars. With a 
two-inch cutter cut rings from the three-inch 
pieces, wash the cut-out bottoms first with water 
and put on the rings. Set in a cool place to rest 
for fifteen minutes. Then wash the top of the 
rings and bake same as directed for the other 
patties. 

For the tops, roll out the trimmings into a thin 
sheet, cut in two-inch round pieces, put on pan 
wash over and bake. 
132.— VOL-AU-VENT(JLARGE PATTY CASES). 

Vol-au- vents are very large patty cases often 
made so large as to hold from one to two quarts of 
filling (which may consist of the regular filling of 
oysters, chicken, etc., or of a filling of game birds 
as for other large meat pies. 

Vol-au-vents are mostly served for parties and 
large dinners. 

Roll out the puff paste into a sheet one inch 
thickness, and put it on a wet baking pan. Put a 
round or oval plate, a little larger than yon want 
the case to be, on top of the paste, and cut with a 
sharp knife around the sides to trim off the sur- 
plus paste. Take off the plate and make another 
circular cut of one inch less diameter (but do not 
cut through) to form the cover. Set the patty in 
the ice box to rest for twenty minutes. When 
ready to bake wash with a light egg-wash and 
bake in a good heat. 

To obtain a very high case it is best to set a 
ring of stiff paper around the case during the first 
part of the baking. It should be about five inches 
high and two inches larger in diameter. This 
gives the case more time to rise before it bakes 
on the sides and makes it bake up more evenly. 

[The small patties are termed petits vols-au-vent 
and petits bouchees] . 

The vols-au-vent and the smaller patty cases are 
also used for sweet pastry. Filled with whipped 
cream and fresh fruits they make very acceptable 
desserts. 

I33._-TARTS AND TARTLETS. 

The tarts and tartlets may be made like the 
patty cases, from puff paste, baked, and the pre- 
pared filling put in after baking; or small patty 
tins may be lined with puff or tart pastes, and 
baked with the filling. If the shells in the tins 
are baked before the filling is put in, it is best to 
dust the lined tins with a little flour and fill up 
with beans, or little balls of flour paste. Bake 
the shells and remove the beans or the paste to 
make room for the filling. This prevents the 



shrinking of the paste in baking. The beans can 
be used over again for the same purpose. 

In England the term Tart is generally applied 
to small fruit pies; and tartlet to the small tarts 
baked in the fluted patty tins. Here in America 
the tarts are baked in the small tins; and small 
patty cases are also termed Tarts and Tartlets, if 
they are filled with sweets. 

In the German and the French, tart is changed 
into torte and tourte respectively, and means 
either a large fruit or cream pie, made in the 
open fashion from rich tart or puff paste; or it 
means a rich round layer cake with cream or fruit 
filling. The tartes from puff paste are made with 
a cover of narrow strips of paste, put on lattice 
fashion; the layer cakes are iced and fancifully 
decorated with French fruits glaces and other 

ornaments. 

134— APPLE PIE. 

Roll out a bottom from pie paste No. 80, line 
the greased pie tins with it and fill with the fruit. 

Nice ripe cooking apples require no previous 
cooking, Slice the apples very thin, season with 
nutmeg, allspice or cinnamon; sprinkle about two 
handfuls of sugar over the apples in each pie; 
distribute a little butter in small bits over the 
apples. 

Use plenty of fruit to make a well filled pie. 

Brush the edge of the rim with water. Roll 
out a cover from paste No. 79 for the top crust. 
Mark the crust with the letter of the friytt which 
the pie contains. (Pie bakers use a stamp for 
this purpose). Make a few small cuts in the 
paste to serve as steam vents during baking. 
Fold the cover in two and cover the pie. 

Press the top and bottom pastes well together 
on the sides; trim off the surplus paste with the 
hands, or use a knife for this purpose. 

Before putting in the oven wash over with some 
milk in which one yolk of egg has been well 
beaten; this gives the pies a nice color. 

An even baking heat of 350 to 400 degrees 
Fahrenheit is best suitable for fruit pies. 

Some apples require to be stewed before using. 
Peel core and slice the apples, stew with a little 
water till tender, add sugar and flavor and let 
cool before filling in the pies. 

135.— SLICED APPLE PIE. 

This pie, like the other, can be made from 
fresh or stewed fruit. Line the pie tin with paste 
No. 80 and trim off the surplus paste. Put the 
fruit on the paste in an even layer and sweeten 
and season to taste. Roll out some top paste No. 
79, (or use puff paste cut in strips about one inch 
wide). Wash the edge of the paste in the pie 
and put on the strips in lattice fashion. Put also 
a strip around the edge. Brush over with egg 
wash, and bake. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKX8, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



17 



This pie may also bo made only with the strip 
aronnd the edge, leaving the center open. 
136— ENGLISH APPLE PIE. 

This pie is best suited for hotel and catering 
trade. It is best served hot. It is made as a deep 
dish pie, and can be served in place of pndding. 

The individual pies are the most suitable for 
hotel and restaurant service. Take the oval 
china vegetable dishes, or the brown pudding 
dishes, fill with the fresh or stewed fruit, put 
on a cover from paste Nc. 79, cut a few holes 
in the top-crust to serve as a steam vent, brush 
over with egg, wash and bake to a nice color. 

In England,for large pies of this kind, it is custo- 
mary to put an inverted cup in the center of the 
pie or pndding, to take up the juice during bak- 
ing and prevent boiling over. For smaller pies a 
tube of stiff paper may be inserted in the center, 
which answers the same purpose. 
137.— PEAR PIE. 
PEACH PIE. 
APRICOT PIE. 
QUINCE PIE. 

Nice soft pears can be used without stewing; 
other pears should be stewed and cooled before 
using. 

Peaches and apricots are peeled, sliced and the 
stones removed; baked with a full cover and also 
like the sliced apple pie. 

For quinces, peel, core and slice the fruit, stew 
till tender. Half apples and half quinces makes 
a very nice pie. Bake like apple pie. 
X38.--BERRY PIES. 

All berries should be washed and picked over 
to remove sand and other impurities. Some 
berries contain very much juice, and for these 
berries it is best to put a thin layer of crumbs in 
bottom of the pie, before putting on the fruit, to 
retain the juice. 

The best way to make berry pies for hotels and 
restaurants is to make them like the English apple 
pie, in deep dishes, with a top cover only, and 
serve the pie in the dish. We used to make fine 
pies this way in New York hotels twenty years 
ago and they proved very good sellers. 

If berries are baked in the flat pies with top 
and bottom crust, the juice often makes the bot- 
tom soggy and soft. When cut into portions it 
runs out and much of it is lost; while in the deep 
dishes all the juice is retained, and a berry pie 
can be made with more fruit in it. 

Fill the dish with strawberries, raspberries, 
currants, blueberries, blackberries or grapes; 
sweeten to taste; wet the edge of the dish, put on 
a cover from top crust paste, make a few cuts in 
it, wash over and bake. 

To blue- and blackberries a little water maybe 
added; the other berries named require no water. 



139.— CRANBERRY PIE. 
GOOSEBERRY PIE. 

Stew the berries with about twelve ounces of 
sugar to the quart of fruit, adding a little water; 
boil slowly till clear; let cool before using. 

Cranberry pies are baked open with strips like 
the sliced apple pie. 

The gooseberry pies are baked with a full cover. 
140.— RHUBARB PIE. 

The young tender stalks require no peeling; 
otherwise peel off the outer skin; cut up in small 
pieces. To each pound of rhubarb add twelve 
ounces of sugar and one ounce of cornstarch, the 
grated rind of one lemon or orange; mix well to- 
gether and fill in the bottoms; bake with strips 
like the cranberry pie, or with a full cover. 

Puff paste may be used for strip covers. For 
a full cover the rich pie crust is better; it makes 
a better crust. Puff paste is too light and easily 
softens from the steam which arises during baking, 
and the crusts gets soft after standing for some- 
time. 

X41.— BANANA PIE. 

Peel and slice the bananas very thin; add sugar, 
a little fresh butter, the juice of some oranges or 
lemons, and a pinch of allspice; or flavor with 
some good rum. Bake with a full crust, or with 
a meringue cover. 

X42.— PINEAPPLE PIE. 

Peel and core ripe pineapple and cut in thin 
slices; stew till clear in a light syrup; flavor with 
a little grated orange peel; let cool and bake with 
a strip cover like sliced apple pie. 

Grated canned pineapple may be used like 
other fruit. 

X43.— FRUIT MERINGUE PIES. 

All the fruit pies can be made into meringue 
pies by baking them open, without cover of any 
crust, and decorate with Meringue Paste No. 93. 

Put the paste in a bag, use a plain or star tube; 
put on strips in lattice fashion and a border 
around the edge; dust with powdered sugar and 
put back in the oven for a minute to color. 

The other way to make fruit meringue pies is to 
bake the bottoms, as described in No. 74, fill 
with the ready stewed fruit, put on the meringue 
paste and give some color in the oven. 
X44.^BOSTON LEMON PIE. 

One pound of sugar, sixteen eggs, six lemons. 

Bake the bottoms to a very light color. Grate 
the rind of four lemons on half of the sugar, add 
the yolks of the eggs and the juice of all the lem- 
ons, stir together on the fire till it thickens, then 
take off the fire. Beat the whites of eggs and 
make a meringue with the other half of the sugar. 
Mix yolks and whites together and fill in the baked 
crusts; sift some powdered sugar over and put 



x8

in a slack oven for twenty to twenty-five minutes. 
The pie puffs up and falls a little after baking, 
bat makes a delicious pie. 

145.— LEMON MERINGUE PIE. 

One quart of water, one pound of sugar, five 
lemons, ^ye yolks, three and one-half ounces of 
cornstarch, two ounces of butter. 

Grate the rind of three lemons onto the sugar; 
dissolve the starch in a little cold water and mix 
with the yolks. Put sugar, water, lemon rind 
and Juice, and the butter to boil. When it boils 
add starch and yolks and stir till it thickens. 
Take off the fire and fill in the previously baked 
bottoms. 

Use the whites of the eggs for the meringue, 
one ounce of sugar lor each white of egg (or use 
Meringue Paste No. 93). 

Spread some of the paste over the cream after 
It has cooled, with the palette knife. Put the 
other paste in the dressing bag and put on a 
border; dust with powdered sugar and put in the 
oven to color. 

The same mixture may be used for covered 
pies: or only half boiled and filled in lined bot- 
toms, baked like custard pie. The mixture may 
be made more or less rich, using more yolks and 
less starch. 

The cheapest lemon pies are made with lemon 
extract and acid; no lemons; leaving out the eggs 
and using color; but the juice and grated rind 
•nly will produce the true flavor. 

X46.— ORANGE MERINGUE PIE. 

The orange pie is made in the same manner as 

I0. Z45, using the rind of one orange only and the 

jttice of three oranges and two lemons. The one 

quart mixture makes about three good sise pies. 

X47.— PINEAPPLE MERINGUE PIE. 

The pineapple pie may be made like the lemon 
pie No. Z45, using one quart of water and one 
quart of pineapple grated; or, for a richer pie, 
use the following mixture: Take one quart of 
grated pineapple (unsweetened), twelve ounces 
of sugar, the juice and rind of one lemon, two 
ounces of cornstarch, four ounces of butter and 
six yolks. Stir together on the fire till it thick- 
ens and fill into the baked bottoms; cover with a 
network or full cover of meringue; sprinkle over 
a few chopped almonds, dust with powdered 
sugar and put in the oven to color. 
Z48.— CREAM PIES. 

One quart of milk, eight yolks, eight ounces of 
sugar, two ounces of cornstarch, one ounce of 
butter. 

Dissolve the starch in a little cold milk and stir 
with the yolks. Set the milk on the fire with the 
sugar and butter. Mix now a little of the hot 
milk with the starch and yolks, and when the 



milk and sugar come to a boil add the yolks and 
starch and stir till it thickens. Take off the fire 
and add the flavor and fill into the baked crusts. 
Finish like the Lemon Meringue Pie. 

This recipe will make all the different cream 
pies by changing the flavors. For Vanilla Cream 
Pie add vanilla extract; for Lemon, the grated 
rind of lemon, etc. 

A very light cream is obtained by adding the 
beaten whites of flve eggs to the cream. As soon 
as it begins to thicken mix the whites well in the 
cream and take off the fire. 

149— COCOANUT CREAM PIE. 

Add four ounces of grated cocoanut to the 
above mixture (No. 148) in the boiling milk and 
flavor with vanilla. 

Z50.— ALMOND CREAM PIE. 

Flavor cream No. Z48 vanilla, add four ounces of 
browned and crushed almonds and sprinkle a few 
chopped almonds on top of the meringue. 
151.— CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE. 

Add two ounces of cocoa powder to No. 148, 
dissolve with the sugar and boil with the milk. 
Flavor with vanilla. 

Finish the pies with a cover of meringue, or 
put the meringue on lattice fashion, with a border 
of dots, and brown lightly in the oven. 
152.— STRAWBERRY CREAM MERINGUE 
PIE. 

Make the vanilla cream, but flll the baked bot- 
toms only half full with the cream. Put on a 
layer of ripe strawberries, sprinkle with sugar, 
and over the berries put a network or make a 
full cover of Meringue Paste No. 93, and put in 
the oven for a minute to color. 

If RASPBERRIES are used, the pie would be 
called Raspberry Cream Meringue Pie. 

Very ripe PEACHES may also be used in this 
manner. 

153.— CREAM PIES WITH PRESERVED 
FRUITS. 

When the fresh fruit gives out, the preserved 
fruits may be used for the cream pies. Fresh 
fruit, like blackberries, grapes or cherries, may 
be made into a compote and used for the pies. 
The pies may be given the name of the caterer, 
or the hotel, and called Grand Hotel Meringue 
Pie or Delmonico Meringue Pie, etc. 
154.— STRAWBERRY PIE WITH WHIPPED 
CREAM. 
RASPBERRY PIE WITH WHIPPED 
CREAM. 

Bake the bottoms as usual, but use the richer 
top crust, or the Short Paste No. 82. Sweeten

stiff froth, sweeten and flavor and spread over

X67.— FRUIT CUSTARD PIES. 

The f rnit custard pies are made similar to the 
fruit cream pies, only a good strong custard takes 
the place of the cream, and the pies are baked 
like the Cnstard Pies. 

The preserved fruits and the compotes of fruit 
given in preceding chapters are most suitable for 
this class of pies. 

The pies are served plain baked. 

Line the pie tins with the cnstard or short 
paste crust, arrange the fruit in an even layer on 
the paste, and fill the pies in the oven with the 
custard by means of a long handled dipper, and 
bake in a medium heat. 

A large variety of fruit custard pies may be 
made in this manner, which should find a ready 
sale at restaurants and lunch counters. 
168.— PRUNE PIES. 

Evaporated prunes should be soaked over night, 
stewed till soft and the stones removed; sweeten 
to taste, flavor with cinnamon and the grated 
rind and juice of lemon; let cool and bake like the 
Apple Pies. 

169.— RAISIN PIE. 

Raisin Pies are made in several ways. The 
large Malaga raisins have the best flavor and 
make the best pie. Cut the raisins in two and 
take out the seeds (or use seeded raisins). Soak 
over night, or for about six hours. For each 
pound of raisins take the grated rind and juice of 
one lemon, and from four to six ounces of sugar. 
Stew the raisins till clear; let cool; fill into the 
lined bottoms, put on the cover and bake like 
other pies. 

The other way is to take the seeded raisins, 
some preserved orange or lemon peel and some 
currants, and chop fine like mince meat; season 
with allspice, sweeten with brown sugar and thin 
up with cider, then bake like a mince pie. 

If some stale cake or crackers are added to this 
mixture it makes an excellent MOCK MINCE PIE. 
170,— MINCE PIE. 

Make the mince pie like the Apple Pie with a 
full cover, and serve hot or cold. 

171.— MINCE MEAT. 

The making of mince meat requires a good 
deal of work in its preparation. It improves in 
flavor with age and keeps in good condition for 
several months if properly made. For this rea- 
son it is best if made in a large quantity to last 
for the season, which is generally from Thanks- 
giving till Easter. 

The commercial article differs greatly in qual- 
ity. The best is equal to the home-made article. 
The cheapest is an uncertain mush, seasoned 
with spices. 

The best tart apples, good beef suet and meat 
and a good quality of spices should be used. 



Brandy is used in the mince meat for flavor, 
and also to preserve the mixture, and prevent 
fermentation. 

In the making of the mince meat, much of the 
orange and lemon peel may be used which is left 
from making fruit ices (instead of buying candied 
peel), preparing it in the manner given in the 
chapters on Preserved Fruits. 

I give here a recipe for a large quantity of 
mince meat, which may be reduced to one-half or 
one-fourth for smaller quantities: 

Take five pounds of lean beef, boil, and when 
cold, chop fine; 

Five pounds of suet clear of strings and 
chopped fine; 

Two bushels of apples, peeled, cored and 
chopped fine; 

Five pounds of seeded raisins, 

Four pounds of orange peel, 

Four pounds of citron peel cut up fine, 

Ten pound^ of currants, 

Five pounds of Sultanas. 

Mix these with twenty pounds of brown sugar. 

One quart of brandy and 

One quart of sherry, 

Four gallons of cider, 

One pound of mixed spices — mace, cloves^ Aut- 
meg, ginger and cinnamon. 

One ounce of salt. 

One ounce of pepper. 

Put into a whiskey barrel, or in a couple of 
very large jars and keep in a cold place. 

When making pies add a little more liquor if 
necessary. 

X72.— FRUIT TARTLETS. 

All the fruit and cream fillings given in former 
recipes may be used for tart fillings; also the fruit 
jams and jellies. 

Take tart paste or puff paste; roll out in a sheet 
about one-eighth of an inch in thickness. "With a 
scalloped cutter cut out rounds a little largev than 
the top of the tart tins; put in the greased tins; 
press it well on the sides with a piece of stiff paste; 
put in the filling and bake. 

A quicker way to line the tart molds is to set the 
greased tart forms on the table; roll out a sheet of 
the paste and lay it over the tins. With a round 
ball of paste press the other paste in the tins and 
cut off the surplus paste, pressing through ivith 
the hands. Set the forms on a pan, fill and bake. 
The fruit tarts may be decorated with meringue 
or whipped cream as fancy dictates.

cover with a wet cloth and pnt away for use. 

When wanted for use take what yon reqnire, 
pnt it in a sancepan, add what flavor and color 
yon wish it to be, set this pan in another pan with 
hot water, or on a slow fire, and stir till it is all 
melted. Do not heat the icing more than blood 
warm, because too much heat makes the icing 
lose its creamy texture and it becomes hard and 
brittle— loses its gloss. 

When the icing is soft enough it should be used 
at once, because it sets and dries tquickly. 

The large cakes are iced with the palette knife; 
the smaller drops and the cut-up blocks are dipped 
in the icing and set on wire grates to drain. 

Fondant is also used between the layers of 
cakes as a filling, because of its creamy consist- 
ency; and it is used in candy making to form the 
body of the chocolate and other cream candies, etc. 

ao6.— TRANSPARENT ICING. 
Boil two pounds of sugar to the blow degree. 
Take oif the fire and rub a little of it against the 
side of the pan to grain. As soon as it gets white 
and creamy stir it Into the other sugar; and use 
same as Fondant Icing No. 205 while hot. 

207.— IMITATION FONDANT ICING. 
WATER ICING. 

Take any quantity of icing sugar (XXXX powd- 
ered sugar)' and mix with hot water into a thin 
paste; color and flavor to suit. Have the icing 
not more than blood warm and use same as Fond- 
ant Icing No. 205. 

The same icing made with cold water and the 
proper flavor and color makes the plain water 
icing. 

The cold icing does not dry as readily as the 
hot icing, but is used like the others. 

208.--BOILED CHOCOLATE ICING. 
Dissolve six ounces of bitter chocolate (un- 
sweetened) with one pound of sugar and half a 
pint of water, let boil till it forms a thread be- 
tween the fingers. Take off the fire, stir till it 
forms a thin skin on top; stir till blood warm and 
use same as the Fondant Icing No. 205. Flavor 
vanilla. 

209.— CREAM CARAMEL ICING. 

One pound of granulated sugar, six ounces of 
butter, half pint of cream. 

Boil all the ingredients together to the soft ball. 
Take off the fire and add a little caramel color. 
Cool a little and use same as Fondant Icing No. 205. 

Chocolate may be added for Chocolate Cream 
Icing. Flavor vanilla. 

This icing may be used also between the layers 
for chocolate and caramel cream cake, and has 
the true caramel flavor. 



Other caramel icing may be made by adding 
caramel coloring to Fondant and other icings. 

210.— ROYAL ICING. 

The Royal icing is used for icing and also for 
ornamenting. It dries rapidly if exposed to the 
air and should be kept well covered with a damp 
cloth at all times, in a cool place. 

For ornamenting it is beaten with the whites of 
eggs till it retains its shape if drawn to a point. 
For icing it is only beaten to about the consist- 
ency of a cream, so it runs smooth. 

The sugar should be run through a very fine 
sieve before using, to prevent lumps clogging the 
comet in decorating. 

Much acid makes a coarse icing, and very little 
should be used for piping; or none at all if a tough 
icing for fine thread lining is required. 

Make the icing pretty strong at the beginning 
and work up white and light; then add a little 
more of the whites till it is of the proper con- 
sistency. 

Take from three to four whites of eggs to one 
pound of XXXX powdered sugar, a small pinch 
of cream of tartar, or one drop of acetic acid; put 
in a china bowl and beat with one or two small 
spatulas, (one in each hand), and treat as directed 
above. 

211.— FRUIT ICING. 

Take clear fruit syrup and mix with XXXX 
powdered sugar to a smooth paste; add a little 
more color and use. 

212.— CHOCOLATE ICING. 

Mix some chocolate which has been melted 
with Fondant or Royal icing. Flavor vanilla. 

Another way is: Dissolve four ounces of un- 
sweetened chocolate with some hot water and add 
one pound of XXXX powdered sugar; mix well 
together warm; flavor vanilla and use. 

Whites of eggs may be added for gloss. Some 
use cocoa butter; and for cheap icings add lard to 
the warm icing. 

213 —MARSHMALLOW ICING. 

Take one ounce of marshmallow iciline powder; 
or use half an ounce of powdered gelatine, half 
an ounce of powdered gum arabic, one pound of 
icing sugar and one pint of warm water. Beat 
up together in a pan of hot water. When light, 
take off and beat cold till it is firm. Flavor 
vanilla and orange. 

If the mixture is too firm more water may be 
added. 

This icing is used mostly for cake filling. In 
larger quantities it is beaten up by machine. 

Iciline powder for marshmallow icing and 
other icing powders are sold by all the confec- 
tioners' supply houses.

217-NEW RECEIPTS AND POINTS ON 
CAKE MAKING. 

In nuJcing np a new receipt a little study of the 
materials is required, to obtain proper results; 
and notice should be taken how they work in the 
mixtures. 

The same goods do not work always alike. The 
flours differ greatly in their water absorbing 
power; and so do the different brands of starch. 
These qualities of flour and starch cause the 
mixtures, cakes or creams, getting too firm or too 
soft as the case may be; and more or less should 
be used, or more liquid added to obtain the right 
consistency. 

The baking and boiling process also causes the 
evaporation of the liquids, and if continued too 
long, causes the drying out of the articles made. 

The best pastry and cake flours are the red 
winter wheat flours of Missouri and Illinois. The 
Michigan and Ohio flours are more starchy, and 
a little strong patent flour may be used with these 
flours for cake mixtures. 

Flour merchants sell cake flours which are 
blended specially for cake baking. 

If baking powder or cream of tartar is used it 
snould be sifted in the flour; and all the flour 
should be sifted before using it in the mixtures. 

For cake and meringues the sugar should be 
dry and sifted before using. 

A good tough butter makes the best cream and 
the lightest cake. Very salty butter should be 
washed before using. 

The eggs should be as fresh as possible and the 
breaking and separating be done carefully, be- 
cause one egg is liable to spoil the whole batch* 
The safest way is to break the eggs one by one in 
a cup; or, if separating the whites, in two cupsi 
before adding them to the other eggs. 

When mixing cakes it is best to have all the 
materials ready which go into the mixture, so the 
mixing can proceed without interruption. Begin 
by preparing the pans in whish the cake is to be 
baked; then weigh the sugar. (If butter is used 
put it on top of the sugar, adding the additional 
weight: this prevents the sticking of the butter to 
the scales). Next weigh the flour and add the 
baking powder or cream of tartar, and sift it with 
the flour into a pan or on a paper. Then break 
up or separate the eggs, and measure eggs and 
milk. If soda is used dissolve it in the milk. 
Ammonia she*ild be powdered very fine and may 



be dissolved in milk or added dry. Grated lenKxn 
rind and spices may be addei to the sugar. The 
liquid extracts are added after the butter is 
creamed with the sugar and eggs, before the flour. 
* Put the sugar and butter in the mixing bowl, 
(it is best for creaming to have the butter a little 
soft, but not too soft, as it becomes oily). Cream 
the butter and sugar light before adding the eggs. 
Have the eggs cold and add them two at a time; 
work them in well; add more again, tiil they ire 
all worked in. 

Some bakers add a little flour during mixing to 
prevent the curdling of eggs and butter; and 
others cream flour and butter to prevent oiling in 
the hot season, adding the sugar and eggs well 
beaten together in the mixture. 

If milk is used in the mixture it is added after 
the eggs are creamed with the butter; also the 
extracts; then the flour is worked in. It is best 
to leave a little of the milk out, if not sure of the 
strength of the flour, to prevent getting the mix- 
ture too slack, and add it after the flour is all in if 
required. 

If fruits or peels are used, they should be added 
when, the flour is about half mixed in. For heavy 
fruitcakes, the fruits and spices may be mixed 
with syrup or liquor the day before using, and 
put in the mixture. For lighter cakes the fruit 
should be soft but dry, to prevent sinking in the 
cakes during baking. 

The baking of pastry and cakes requires differ- 
ent degrees of heat. Puff Paste from 400 to 450 
degrees Fahrenheit; Pie Paste 350 to 400 degrees 
Fahrenheit; also cream puffs, lady-fingers, layer 
cakes and light cookies, from 300 to 350 degrees 
Fahrenheit; the large cakes, which contain milk 
and baking powder, from 250 to 300 degrees 
Fahrenheit; and the heavy pound and fruit cake, 
about 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Hard cakes which 
consist of sugar and eggs only, or with little flour, 
also the meringues, require still less heat in bak* 
ing. Large sheet and layer cakes, also the heavy 
large cakes, should be moved as little as possible 
during the time they are coming up in the oven, 
as moving causes the mixture to fall. 

Sometimes it is advisable to bake the cakes on 
double pans when the oven has got too much bot- 
tom heat; and large cakes require covering with 
paper to prevent baking too much color. 

When a large cake is fully baked, it shrinks 
lightly from the sides, and feels elastic to the

Some bakers add burned sugar to the cake or 
brown floar to darkan the mixtore; but this caa-- 
torn ia detrimental to the good flavor of the cakes. 

The heavy cakes should be baked at a low 
temperature of about 200 degrees Fahrenheit, asd 
made about two and one-half inches thick. A 
cake of this thickness, about a foot square will 
bake in two and one*half to three hours' time. 
The pans should have a doable lining of strong 
paper, well buttered, te prevent too much color in 
baking.

Df lard, fiva pounds of floar, four eggs, two 
sances of mixed spices, four pounds of currants, 
two pounds of raisins, a half pound of citron. 

Cream sugar, spices and lard; add molasses; 
milk with the soda dissolved; add the flour and 
beat in the eggs; last, mix in the fruit. Bake like 
the other fruit cakes. 

264— WHITE FRUIT CAKES. 

Add to No. 240 three pounds of mixed fruit, 
consisting of two pounds of sultanas, a half pound 
of blanched and shredded almonds, a half pound 
of citron and orange peel; also add four ounces 
more flour. 

Mix and bake as usual. 

With other fruit the same mixture can be made 
into FIG. DATE. PLAIN RAISIN, or SUL- 
TANA CURRANT CAKES, etc. 
265— NUT CAKES. 

From the pound and white cake mixtures a 
variety of Nut Cakes may be made with the 
different kinds of nut meats. 

The best way to bake these cakes is to bake 
them in the small round, oval or square tins 
which hold from eight ounces to one pound. The 
Angel Cake molds may also be used to advantage. 

By using the different nuts you get 

WALNUT CAKE, 

PECAN CAKE, 

BRAZILIAN CAKE, 

PEANUT CAKE. 

FILBERT CAKE and 

PISTACHIO CAKE. 

Other combinations of this kind aro made of 
mixed nuts and almonds; nuts and sultanas, 
nuts and orange peel, or nuts and French 
cherries, etc. 

Use either of the mixtures; flavor with lemon, 
orange or vanilla, or vanilla with a drop of bitter 
almond. 

Use about one ounce or more of the chopped 
nut meat to one pound of cake batter, and when 
the cakes are baked, ice fully and sprinkle with 
chopped nuts before the icing gets dry; or ice and 
sprinkle the sides with chopped nuts, and use 
some half walnuts or other kinds, or split almonds 
to decorate the top. 

For less expensive cake put only a broad strip 
of icing in the center and decorate with a few 
half nuts. 

Chocolate, caramel and vanilla, also nut-flavored 
icings are the most suitable for Nut Cake. 

With different shapes of tins, various icing and 
mixtures you can evolve many more cakes of this 
kind. 

A nice cake deserves a nice name and sells bet- 
ter, so you may call your cake Princess or Vic- 
toria or Duchess Nut Cake, etc. 



266— MARBLE CAKES. 

Take white cake mixtures No. 242 or No. 243; 
color one-fourth part pink, and one-fourth part 
chocolate; put a thin layer of the white mixture 
on the bottom; put the other two colors in turns 
in the center; finish the top with a thin layer of 
white cake and bake. 

Ice with a soft water icing; color a little of the 
icing pink and chocolate, put each in a paper 
comet and draw straight lines in alternate colors 
across the soft white icing, then draw the knife 
in straight lines or in siz-zag across the colored 
strips while the icing is soft. 

267— DOMINO CAKES. 
Bake two sheets of cake of any suitable mix- 
ture and fill with jelly, jam or cr^am. Prepare 
two icings — a white and a chocolate. Ice one 
part white, one part chocolate. Cut the iced cake 
in long strips, about two inches wide, while the 
icing is soft. Draw a line along the center of 
each strip in reverse color, then cut the strip in 
one-inch slices and make the dots to imitate 
dominoes.

They are prepared like the other cakes which 
contain milk. 

A baking temperature of 350 degrees, and for 
the plainest mixtures 400 degrees Fahrenheit, is 
the most suitable for these cakes. 

For the best and richest kind of these cakes 
the Butter, Sponge, Genoise and Pound Cake 
mixtures are used by caterers; and other special 
mixtures are made as occasion demands. 

All the fillings given from No. iix to No. 229, 
several of the tart fillings, and also the icings 
may be used for the Layer Cakes. 

The fruit jellies and jams make another variety 
of fillings. 

The Nut Cake recipes and suggestions, as given 
In No. 265, can be made into Layers and iced as 
suggested. 

The Layer Cakes are made in two or three lay- 
ers. When they are baked and cool, the filling 
is put between, pressed together, trimmed straight, 
and iced on top and sides. 

The jelly cakes are often sprinkled thickly with 
oocoanut, which makes the use of a thin Icing 
possible and looks nice. 

Some caterers use the square pound cake, and 
split it in two or three layers, put filling between 
and ice. This makes very attractive Layer Cakes 
which are given special names. The cakes are 
named either after the flavors they contain, or 
are named after prominent persons or localities. 

In many of the best cakes a double icing is 
used. Either a firm fruit jam, or almond paste 
Icing Is put on and followed with another coat of 
Royal or Fondant. The English method of icing 
Loaf and Layer Cake in this manner, is to take a 
thin almond paste or macaroon mixture, spread 
it over the cake, sprinkle or dip in shredded 
almonds or nuts, and put the cake into the oven 
for a minute to get a nice color; or, take a firmer 
paste which keeps its shape and put It on with 
bag and star tube in a decorative way; or, spread 
the paste over plain, and take a fork and make it 
rough looking, then put the cake in the oven to 
color. When cold the cake is finished with 
fondant or royal icing, or decorated with French 
fruits glaces. 

The Layer Cakes are also baked in large sheets, 
two layers put together with filling and iced in 
one whole sheet; or, cut up in small squares or 
diamonds before Icing and dipped in the icing like 
cream candies; or, set nearly touching each other 
on a wire grate and the icing poured over. The 
icing used may be a soft royal icing or a fondant 
icing. 

To make the small cakes attractive, prepare a 
batch of white icing and divide it into four or 
five parts; color one part pink, flavor rose or 



maraschino; one part yellow, flavor orange; one 
part chocolate; one part pale green, flavor pista- 
chio; and leave one part white. Dip the cakes 
in the different colors, and, before the icing be- 
comes dry, put a slice of fruit glace, and half an 
almond, walnut or hickory nut on each piece; or, 
a dot of icing of reverse colors. 

Another form of decorating is to use ornament- 
ing icing in different colors, and with a comet, 
pipe on patterns of any description, setting it off 
with dots or bright fruit jelly. 

Another way is to prepare tiny flowers and 
stars beforehand from royal icing; or, buy small 
berry candies, dragees, etc., of different colors 
and drop them on the small cakes as soon as 
they are iced. 

The colored sugars may also be used in these 
cakes. 

Many bakers utilize stale cakes in this manner 
without any filling, only they use different colored 
Icing and sprinkle the cake with chopped nuts. 
The plainer kinds are called Nougatinas. The 
others, made from black fruit cakes or ginger 
bread, are generally Iced chocolate, and are 
called Negritos, or Negro Nougatinas. Of course 
there are many other ways of decorating and a 
skillfol inventive workman can devise thousands 
of them to make the cake look attractive.

till into the baked bottoms; let cool and serve. To 
this creme may be added chocolate, or the grated 
rind of oranges or lemons, nnt or browned al- 
monds, and this wonld give yonr Creme an 
Chooolat, Creme d'Oranges, Creme de Noi»- 
•ttas, etc. The same creme made from wine in- 
stead of cream, flavored with spice and lemon o.* 
orange* rind makes another variety of Wine Cream 
Tonrtes. 

Other tonrtes of this class are made from fresh 
fmits, which should be very ripe, snch as straw- 
berries, raspberries and ripe soft peaches. Pre- 
pare and bake the bottoms same as for the Creme

put it on a sieve to drain. Sweeten two quarts 
of crushed fruit and stir it cold till it forms a rich 
jam. Mix in this two-thirds of the drained cream 
and fill into the baked bottom. Fill the rest of 
the whipped cream into a bag and decorate the 
tonrte with it in lattice fashion. 

Some of these Urge Tart Cakes can be baked 
in sheet form and cut in squares. They may also 
bo baked in the smaller layer cake tins, but should 
sell for abetter price to leave a reasonable profit 
for the maker. They are best suited for a high- 
class catering trade and for hotels.

Mix same as for Cup Cake and drop on greased

295.- HONEY CAKE. 

Take half New Orleans molasses and half honey 
and let it come to a boil; skim well, throw a little 
cold water in it, let it boil up and skim again, 
then take off the fire. Let cool till you can hold 
your hand in it, then work in enough soft flour 
to make a medium dough. 

In Germany it is customary to make this dough 
several months before it is used, because it im- 
proves with age. 

Take from this stock dough, and into five 
pounds of it work one-half ounce of soda, or one- 
fourth ounce of ammonia dissolved in a little 
water, and a tablespoonful of mixed spice. Add 
one-half pound of chopped almonds, one* half 
pound of citron and some lemon extract, and 
work it all well together. 

Before baking the whole batch it is best to 
make a test with one small cake, because the dif- 
ference in the acidity of the honey and molasses 
requires this test, to be certain in the result. 

If the cakes are too light, work more stock 
dough into it; if too heavy, add more soda or 
ammonia 

Make into single cakes; or, roll out a sheet as 
large as the pan, grease and dust the pan with 
flour, put on the dough about one-third inch thick 
and bake in a medium heat. 

Make a boiled icing like No. 206, very thin, 
grain it on the side of the pan till it gets white 
and brush the cake over with it. Let dry and 
cut the cake in small pieces. Other cakes are 
made smaller shapes in square and heart forms; 
also figures of men and animals are cut from 
the paste, decorated with icing of different colors. 

Other decorations are executed with blanched 
almonds and slices of citron, and the cakes are 
iced with a gloss of gum water while warm. 

The cheapest grades of these cakes are made 
from molasses and brown sugar in the same man** 
ner as given above.

Fill the roll with the creams, and ice when cold 
with chocolate, vanilla, or caramel icing; or 
spread with a light jam or jelly, and roll in cocoa- 
nut; or fill with nut or almond cream, or icing; 
spread the outside with a thin almond icing and 
roll in chopped nuts. 

Use Cream No. 157 for the Floradora Cream 
Roll. 

Another variety of these rolls are made with 
two colors; one part of the mixture is colored 
pink or chocolate. Two thin sheets are put to- 
gether with jelly; another coat of jelly or cream 
is spread on the top, and both sheets are rolled 
up together. 

Another way is to roll one small roll of one 
color inside of another roll; the outside can be 
masked with jam, or iced with fondant or other 
icing, and decorated with fancy piping and with 
French fruits. 

These fancy rolls are sold as Swiss Roll, Paris 
Roll. Princess Roll, etc. 

305— PUNCH CAKE. 

Take some left-over sponge, pound or white 
cakes, and cut up in half-inch dice. Make a thin 
syrup with one pint of water and one pound of 
granulated sugar, add the juice and grated rind of 
one orange or lemon and a glass of good rum. 
Moisten the cake with this syrup and mix to- 
gether. 

Line a square pan with a thin sheet of teponge 
cake on bottom and sides; spread with jam or 
jelly and put in the moistened cake. Take another 
thin sheet of sponge cake, spread with jelly, and 
put with the jelly inside on top of the moistened 
cake. Press well together, put another heavy 
pan on top, with a weight to press down, and let 
stand for some time to make it firm; then turn 
the pan upside down on a board and ice with a 
punch icing, flavored rum and lemon. 

306— HARLEQUIN CAKE. 

This cake is made in the same manner as the 
Punch Cake, using cakes of different colors, pink, 
white, dark and yellow, cut in dice and mixed 
with a fruit syrup, or with diluted jelly, and fill 
into a pan lined same as for Punch Cake. Ice in 
different colors same as in No. 266. These cakes 
are very useful to dispose of left-over cakes. 

Another cake of this kind can be made, using 
crumbs. Mix with a few chopped nuts and 
raisins, add a good flavor of spices, and moisten 
with syrup or wine sauce, and finish same way as 
for Punch or Harlequin Cake. 

307— NEAPOLITAN CAKE. 
For this cake you require four different kinds 
of cake. A solid Pound and Lady Cake mixture 



are the best. Color one part chocolate, one part 
pink, leave one part white and one part yellow. 
Cut the cake in one-inch square strips, and jam 
the pieces together, placing a thin two-inch strip 
of sponge cake on the bottom and top. Mask the 
square with Almond Icing No. 2x6, and put in the 
oven to color lightly. Let cool and ice in three 
colors with fondant or water icing. 
308— DEVIL'S CAKE. 

Bake three layers from mixture No. 279, or 
from plain Chocolate or Spice Cake mixtures. 
Spread with chocolate filling, and ice with a very 
dark chocolate icing.

ECLAIRS. 

Make the mixture No. Z02 or X03. Lay out 
with bag and plain tube in the size of large drops 
on greased and dusted pans; brush over with eggs 
and bake in 400 degrees Fahrenheit. When done 
cut on the sides and fill with pastry cream. 

The puffs may also be filled with whipped cream, 
sweetened and flavored. Cut out a round piece 
from the top and fill with cream. Dress the 
Eclairs on the pans in finger shape; let stand for 
a while before baking, and bake in a slower heat 
than the puffs; fill with cream and ice with choco- 
late, vanilla, etc , etc. 

310— LADYFINGERS.

put the paper on pans and bake in 400 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Let cool and take off the fingers, 
wetting the paper on the underside, and stick two 
together. 

3ZZ— SMALL FANCY CAKES FROM SPONGE 
MIXTURES. 
A variety of small cakes can be made from the 
sponge mixtures; making plain drops and sprinkle 
with nuts and almonds. Spread the bottom with 
jelly when baked and stick two together; or, make 
drops in bean shape, put two together with almond 
paste and ice with chocolate, white, yellow, pink 
or light green. Other drops are scooped out and 
filled with cream or jam, iced and decorated like 
the other small cakes, as I have suggested in No.

The short breads are improved by adding the 
grated rind of lemon and some yolks or whole 
eggs. (The old original mixtures are without 
eggs and flavor.) It is also best to use a very fine 
powdered sugar to make smooth mixture. The 



cakes may be decorated with royal icing and fruit;

ICE CREAM WAFERS. 
K lb. sugar ^ lb. flour Z2 whites of eggs 
vanilla flavor, a little cream or milk. 
Beat the whites firm, add the sugar and flavor 
and mix well, then add the flour and some milk to 
make a soft batter. This mixture can be flavored 
rose and colored pink; or cinnamon added to the 
vanilla, etc. 

Take smooth pans, well cleaned, and make hot 
in the oven; rub over with white wax and let cool. 
(Drained butter may be used also, but it is pre- 
ferable to use wax.) Lay out the wafers and 
spread with the back of a spoon in round or oval 
shape, or about three inches in diameter; then 
put one pan at a time in a good oven of about 400 
degrees Fahrenheit, and let color nicely. Draw 
the pan to the front of the oven, where you can 
reach the waf6rs, and with the palette knife take 
them up. one after the other, and roll on a stick. 
This has to be done as quick as possible, or the 
wafers will become too crisp and break in rolling. 
To make Comets, the wafers are rolled on a 
pointed stick. Another way to dress the wafers 
on the pans, is to use a piece of cardboard cut 
like a stencil in the shape of a wafer. The sten- 
cil is put on the pan, then put a little of the pre- 
pared paste in the hole and smooth it with the 
palette knife to an even thickhess; this gives a 
uniform size to the wafer. 

By means of the stencil the wafers are made 
for cases, cornucopias and leaves, which are used 
for decorating show pieces. 

Wafers will keep for a long time in dry air-tight 
boxes, and can be made in all flavors.

363— MACAROON DECORATING. 

Macaroons may be decorated in many ways be- 
fore and after baking. Before baking they may 
be decorated with split almonds, citron and 
angelica cut in diamonds; candied cherries cut in 
small pieces; chopped nuts and almonds. These 
decorations may be varied by laying out the cakes 
in different shapes, like rings, S shapes, fingers, 
three small drops touching each other, clover leaf 
fashion, etc., etc. 

After baking, the macaroons may be filled with 
jam or cream by punching a small hole in the top 
while warm and soft, and filling the cavity with a 
paper comet, and top off with a dot of icing. 

A fancy pattern may be piped on with royal 
icing in several colors; or the cakes may be iced 
and sprinkled with colored or nonpareil sugar, etc. 

Other nuts maybe added to the preparation for 
WALNUT and FILBERT MACAROONS, choco- 
late for CHOCOLATE MACAROONS, peels and 
angelica for ORANGE and ANGELICA MACA- 
ROONS.

ICINGS may be used in ihe same manner, 

The CHOCOLATE and CARAMEL ICINGS 
are also effective for decorating, if trimmed in 
pink or white colors. 

The cake to be iced should be trimmed straight 
and the icing put on in one or two coatings, and 
let dry before decorating. 

I think a fine line ornamenting the most artistic, 
but it requires considerable skill and long practice, 
also a steady hand. 

In decorating, it is best to find the exact center 
of the cake; mark the outer edge in even divisions, 
and put on the design. 

A plainer and more practical way, and most 
effective, for the less experienced, is to use 
stamps, designs of scrolls and figures, which can 
be made, or bought in supply houses, Mark out 
the top of the cake with a square or star pattern 
in divisions, mark the divisions with the scroll or 
stamp, and then trace the lines with bag and tube. 

The Royal Icing should be light but tough, for 
line-ornamenting, with very littie acid; or better, 
without any, because acid makes the icing porous 
and the lines break easily. To increase the 
effect, silver and gold dragees, leaves and flowers, 
made from icing and gum pastes, may be used. 

For cakes iced with Fondant and Water Icing 
the French fruits glaces may be used for leaf and 
flower effects; also for small baskets and cornu- 
copias, interspersed with a line decoration of 
Royal Icing. 

The different colored fruit jellies may be ap- 
plied, pressed through a cloth and filled tn a paper 
cornet, between the other decorations, which is 
also very effective and rich looking. 

Other large ornaments for cake tops are made 
from firm macaroon paste in form of rings and 
scrolls, baked and put together with caramel sugar 
or Royal Icing, decorated with piping and with 
candied fruit, etc.

press the crumbs well into the butter. Fill the 



centre with the firm marmalade and finish the 
top with crumbs. Set the molds in a pan with 
hot water and bake for twenty minutes. Serve 
with fruit or cream sauce. 

Another way is to line the molds with thin 
slices of buttered bread, cut to fit the molds, and 
fill with Apple Braise No. 32. The molds may 
also be lined with the crust No. 97 or 98, and 
filled with jam or stewed apples. 

464.— CHARLOTTE OF APPLES A LA 
WINDSOR. 

Bake in the Charlotte molds about half as 
many cakes as yon require puddings, from any 
plain cakes mixture. The cakes are better to cut 
if baked the day before using. Cut each cake in 
six or eight thin slices; butter and sugar the molds. 
Have ready a good apple sauce. Place one slice 
of cake in the bottom, on it one layer of apple 
sauce; then another layer of cake; apple sance 
again, and another layer of cake, to make two or 
three layers of apples, and three or four of cake. 
The apple sauce should be of the right consistency 
to moisten the cake. Set the molds in a pan of 
water, cover a with buttered paper and bake for 
twenty-five minutes. Turn from the molds on a 
pan, so the bottom becomes the top; dust thickly 
with powdered sugar. Heat a stout wire to a 
white heat and burn a pattern on top of the 
Charlotte, lattice fashion. Serve with an English 
cream sauce, or Chaudeau with sliced almonds.

RICE PUDDINGS. 

545.— RICE BOILED IN WATER. 
Wash the rice a couple of times in cold water. 
Put a large pot on the fire, holding about two gal- 
lons of water, let come to a boil; drop in the rice, 
and let boil for about half an hour, or till you 
can crush the grains between the fingers. Strain 
off the water. 



546.— PLAIN BOILED RICE. 

Add to each quart of the rice boiled in water 
(No. 545) one quart of milk, and let simmer down, 
on a slow fire, till it tickens. 

The rice, while it is still warm, may be pressed 
in wetted molds or cups and let cool, and may be 
served cold, turned from the molds, with cream 
and sugar. 

547.— RICE PUDDING WITH APPLES. 

Prepare a compote of sliced apples. Boil eight 
ounces of rice with milk till it is soft and of a 
creamy consistency. Make a quart of custard, 
with one quart of milk, six ounces of sugar, 
eight yolks; flavor with the grated rind of half a 
lemon and some mace. Mix the custard with the 
rice. Fill the rice custard and apples in alternate 
layers in the pudding dish. Have bottom and top 
rice. Bake till the custard is set, and serve with 
wine or cream sauce. 

For small individual puddings, serve in the dish 
the puddings are baked in, with sweetened and 
flavored whipped cream. Serve hot or cold. 

548.— BAKED RICE PUDDING. 
Butter a large pudding pan which holds one 
gallon. Wash one pound of rice; put it in the 
pan with eight ounces of sugar and half a grated 
nutmeg. Fill the pan nearly full of milk, set in 
the oven and bake slowly for two hours or more. 
If the pudding colors before the rice is done, 
cover with buttered paper. Serve with wine, 
cream or fruit sauce. 

549.— GERMAN RICE PUDDING. 

Wash well one pound of rice, and boil slowly 
in one gallon of milk till soft; add four ounces of 
bu»ter and a little salt. (The rice should be of 
soft creamy consistency, not too thick.) Add 
more milk, if required. Fill into the small indi- 
vidual china dishes, nearly full. Sift over a 
thick layer of sugar and cinnamon, to form a 
crust, and serve in this manner. 

The pudding should be soft enough to require 
no other sauce. 

The same pudding may be served hot or cold, 
without the cinnamon and sugar, but with sweet" 
ened whipped cream flavored vanilla. 

550.— RICE CUSTARD PUDDING. 
Steam or boil one pound of rice with thi^ce 
quarts of milk till soft. Prepare a custard with 
one quart of milk, ten to twelve eggs, eight 
ounces of sugar, a pinch of salt; flavor lemon 
and mace. Stir the custard in the boiled rice 
with six ounces of butter; fill into the prepared 
pudding molds, and bake in water till the custard 
is set. Turn out of the molds and serve with 
sultana, wine, cream or fruit sauce.

576.--YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

This pudding does not properly belong to the 
class of sweet puddings served with the pastry. 
It IS a batter pudding without sweetening, served 
generally with roast beef. The batter pudding 
No. 453, without sugar, baked in a buttered 
square pan, makes an excellent pudding for this 
purpose, and some chefs use plain mixture as 
given here: 

Three-quarters of a pound of flour, one quart 
of milk, ten eggs, three ounces of melted butter, 
a little salt, grated nutmeg. 

Separate the eggs, and warm the milk lightly. 
Have the flour well sifted. Add about half of the 
milk to the flour and beat smooth, then add the 
yolks, butter and nutmeg, and gradually the rest 
of the milk; then add the beaten whites, and mix 
thoroughly. Bake in a quick oven to a nice brown. 



577- COLD PUDDINGS AND SIDE DISHES. 

A large variety of paddings are classed under 
this heading; and for restaurant service these 
cold dishes are very useful, because they may be 
kept on hand and in good condition for some time; 
while the hot puddings lose much in quality stand- 
ing after they are ready. 

It is necessary to have the proper forms for the 
different puddings to be served in an attractive 
manner. 

The high dome-shaped molds and ring mold are 
the most useful for cold puddings; also the timbale 
molds, which are best for custards. 

For the frozen and other large iced puddings 
melon and timbale molds should have tight fitting 
covers, and the ice cream brick molds can be used 
for some of the frozen puddings. 

Many of the frozen puddings are ice creams in 



combination with fruits and cake, and for this 
reason I have placed some of them in the part of 
Frozen Creams. 

578.— COLD CABINET PUDDING. 

3 pints of rich milk, za yolks. 8 ozs. sugar, 

a ozs. gelatin, 8 ozs. sultanas, 6 ozs. currants, 

a ozs. cherries, 2 ozs. pineapple, a little mace, 

the grated rind of one lemon. 

Cut the candied fruit in dice, and with the 
raisins and currants, let simmer in a pint of light 
syrup or wine sauce till all the liquid is taken up 
by the fruit, then let cool. Soak the gelatin in a 
little cold water. When soft strain off the water 
and put the gelatin aside. 

Prepare the cake same way as for Baked Cabi- 
net Pudding No. 484. and moisten with a little 
sherry wine or syrup. Fill into the molds (which 
require no butter for this pudding) in layers with 
the soaked fruit. Let the milk and sugar come 
near to the boiling point; stir in the yolks; take 
off when it begins to thicken; add flavor and 
gelatin, and strain. Pour the custard over the 
cake in the molds, let soak in thoroughly, and set 
in the ice box till the gelatin is well set. Un- 
mold the puddings by dipping in hot water for a 
moment; turn out on dish. Serve with whipped 
cream, or with a cold fruit sauce. 

579.— CHOCOLATE FARINA PUDDING. 

3 pints of milk, z pint of whipped cream, z lb. sugar* 

4 ozs. chocolate, 6 ozs. farina, i)i oz. gelatin, 

vanilla flavor. 

Soak the gelatin in a little cold water. Set milk 
and sugar to boil. Sprinkle in the farina, and let 
boil to a creamy consistency. Take off the fire, 
add the chocolate; stir until well dissolved, then 
add the gelatin and flavor. Stir on ice till it 
begins to set, draw in lightly the whipped cream, 
dip the pudding molds in water, dust with sugar, 
fill in with the mixture and set in the ice box. 
When cold and firm turn from the molds, and 
serve with a cold cream sauce. 

The same pudding may be made with the yolks 
of eight to ten eggs, a custard of a quart of milk, 
to which is added two ounces of gelatin (without 
the chocolate), into a plain Farina Custard, and 
served with cream, or a cold fruit sauce. 

580.— COLD CORNSTARCH PUDDING. 

a quarts of milk. 5 ozs. cornstarch, 8 ozs. sugar, 
8 eggs, vanilla flavor. 
Prepare the same way as for No. 488, except 
stir the yolks with the cornstarch; let thicken and 
add the beaten whites and flavor. Fill at once 
into slightly wetted cups. Let cool, and serve 
with fruit or cream sauce. 



64 



PAUL RICHARD'S BOOK OP BRBADS, CAKB8. PASTRIES. ICBS AND SWBSTMBATI. 



580 A.— CORNSTARCH PUDDING. 

CORNSTARCH BLANC MANGE. 
2 quarts of milk, )i pint of whipped cream, 

10 ozs. sagar, 5 to 6 ozs. cornstarch, 

a pinch of salt, vanilla flavor. 

Dissolve the starch in some cold milk. Let 
milk and sngar come to a boil. Have the whipped 
cream ready; add the cornstarch to the boiling 
milk, stir and let thicken. Take off the fire, add 
salt and flavor, and mix in the whipped cream. 
Fill into the wetted cups or forms, and let cool. 

A very light mixture may be obtained from the 
same recipe, omitting the whipped cream, and 
adding the beaten whites of six eggs, jnst before 
taking off the fire; mix well and fill into the forms 
at once. 

A variety of these cornstarch paddings can be 
made with fresh and preserved fruits. Place half 
a peach or apricot, or sweetened berries, in the 
bottom of the cup; fill with the hot cornstarch, 
and turn out when cold. Serve with the juice of 
the fruit, or with whipped cream. 

Another attractive way, is to fill the cornstarch 
into the ring forms, like the savarin paddings; 
turn out when cold, and fill the centre with a 
compote of fruit, or with sweetened strawberries 
or raspberries. 

Plain boiled rice, tapioca, sago and farina may 
be used in the same manner; filled into the wetted 
forms while warm, and when cold served like the 
cornstarch. 

581. — CHOCOLATE CORNSTARCH 

PUDDING. 
Prepare same way as for No. 580. Dissolve 
four ounces of chocolate with the sugar and a 
little milk, and let come to a boil with the rest of 
the milk; then add the starch as usual. Serve 
with vanilla cream sauce or whipped cream.

)i pint of whipped cream, X Pi>^^ ^^ maraschino, 

iji OS. gelatin. 

Boil the rice in water (see No. 545); strain and 
let simmer with the milk and sugar to a thick 
cream; add the dissolved gelatin, and stir till cool. 
Before it sets add the mararchino and draw in th e 
whipped cream. Put into a dome-shaped or ring 
pudding form; set on ice till firm. Serve with a 
cold raspberry or strawberry sauce. 

A variety of this pudding can be made after 
this recipe, adding fresh or canned fruit to the 
rice; or, fill the rice in alternate layers with the 
fruit. 

Raisins and currants, also candied fruits, should 
be simmered in a light syrup for some time, and 
cooled before using. 



583.— RICE PUDDING, JAPANESE. 
Prepare two quarts of plain boiled rice, let 
simmer with milk to a soft cream, and let cool. 
Beat one pint of whipped cream firm, sweeten 
and flavor vanilla. Draw this lightly into the 
cold rice, fitf into fancy paper cases, decorate 
with thin sfices of candied ginger, and >hen 
decorate with whipped cream. 

584.— COLD RICE WITH FRUITS. 

Prepare the plain boiled rice; let thicken and 
simmer down till it is firm enough to keep shape 
after it has cooled; sweeten and flavor. 

Rinse the pudding forms or cups vdth water 
and sprinkle with granulated sugar; fill with the 
warm boiled rice; let get cold in the molds. 
Turn out and serve with any suitable compote of 
fruit or rich fruit sauce. 

Strawberries and raspberries and ripe fresh 
peaches cat in slices and sweetened, served in a 
border of cold rice and decorated with whipped 
cream, make one of the best summer desserts. 

The lunch rooms serve a cold rice pudding, 
which consists of rice steamed, or boiled in milk 
and water slightly sweetened, filled into wetted 
caps while warm, with a couple of raisins in the 
bottom of the cups. After it has cooled, it is firm 
enough to keep shape. It is tamed from the cups 
and served with a pitcher of plain cream. This 
makes a very profitable pudding. 

5S5.— LEMON SNOW PUDDING. 

PINEAPPLE SNOW PUDDING. 
STRAWBERRY SNOW PUDDING. 
RASPBERRY SNOWPUDDING. 
ORANGE SNOW PUDDING. 
I quart of water, z lb. of sugar, 2 ozs. of gelatin, 
the grated rind of 3 lemons, the juice of 5 lemons, 
z pint whites of eggs beaten on ice to a firm froth. 

Soak the gelatin in one pint of the water, add 
the grated lemon to the sugar, also the juice, and 
dissolve with the other pint of water. Dissolve 
the gelatin on the fire, mix with sugar and Jaice, 
strain and beat on ice till it begins to thicken. 
Beat it gradually into the whites. Fill into the 
cold pudding molds and set on ice. 

This pudding may be improved by using some 
white wine, leaving out a part of the lemon juice, 
and as much water as wine is added. 

To serve: dip the molds a moment in hot water, 
turn out and serve with wine, cream, or custard 
sauce. 

Other fruit juices may be used, taking the same 
quantities of liquids and gelatin, making PINE-

rest for a minute till the jelly on the sides begins 
to set. Give the mold a few turns, lift from the 
ice, pour out the jelly from the centre, and put 
the coated mold in the ice box. Proceed in this 
manner till all the molds are lined. 

597.— ALASKA SOUFFLE PUDDING.

or star tube, and cover the cream in pyramid 
fashion. Decorate with French fruit; dust with 
powdered sugar. Set the dish in another platter 
in a very hot oven or range, to brown lightly, and 
serve at once. 



598.-LARGE AND SHALL CHARLOTTES. 

The -Charlottes are made in various ways, with 
fillings of fruit and creams. 

The large Charlottes are the most attractive, 
because they admit of more decoration. 

The casing may be built around the creams 
after it is turned from the mold. It may be 



formed of iced strips of cake, fancj macaroons, 
meringues, and of fancy rolled wafers, placed 
around the base of the creams, and further 
decorated with whipped cream. 

Another way is to build the case from lady- 
fingers, macaroons, or meringues, around the out- 
side of the Charlotte mold, fastening the pieces 
together with sugar boiled to the caramel degree, 
or with royal icing. Let it dry well, and set the 
prepared case over the cream after it is turned 
from the mold. 

For the small Charlottes, the cases may be 
lined with the special crusts given in Nos. 97 and 
98. Ladyfingers and rolled wafers are also used 
for the lining. 

The commercial way is to serve the Charlottes 
in the paper cases, which are lined with sponge 
cake or ladyfingers, cut to fit; and some caterers 
serve large Charlottes in one- and two-quart glass 
bowls, lined with ladyfingers, filled with simple 
whipped cream, sweetened and flavored. The 
small ones in sherbet or wine glasses lined with 
ladyfingers or wafers, the centre decorated with 
cherries and angelica. 

The CHARLOTTE RUSSE and other cream 
mixtures in the following chapters are for creams 
which are to be turned from the molds. The 
amount of gelatin given is sufficient for this pur- 
pose. For Charlottes served in the case, less 
gelatin may be used; and in the small Charlottes, 
if they do not have to stand very long before 
serving, it may be left out altogether. 

The gelatins vary in strength, and the cheaper 
grades possess a strong flavor of glue, which often 
mars the delicate flavor of the creams, if too 
much is used. 

The most difficult and delicate part in preparing 
creams, to make them perfect, is the bringing to- 
gether at the right moment the part which con- 
tains the gelatin and the whipped cream. If the 
part which contains the gelatin is added too soon, 
before it begins to set, it injures the lightness of 
the whipped cream, and the preparation loses 
much of its beauty. If it sets too much, the 
gelatin part forms lumps, which cannot be prop- 
erly amalgamated with the lighter whipped cream. 

As soon as the mixture is prepared, it should be 
filled into the forms while it is still in a flowing 
condition, before the gelatin is firmly set. This 
foirU must he observed in all the creams in which 
gelatin is used, because it is essential to make 
them perfect.

A plainer Charlotte of this kiad can be made 
by adding ripe berries to the Charlotte Russe 
mixtures Nos. z, 2, or 3 (the strawberries cat in 
halves or quarters; the raspbexries left whole), 
and filled into the molds as usnal. Or, if served 
in the cases, some sweetened berries may be 
placed in the bottom, and the case filled with the 
mixture No. 4. which contains no gelatin. 

Ripe fresh peaches or apricots, cut in small dice 
and sweetened, may be substituted for berries, 
naming them PEACH or APRICOT CHAR- 
LOTTE. 

Other combinations may be made by adding 
crushed macaroons, browned almonds, or other 
nut meats, to peaches and apricots; or by using 
other preserved fruits or French fruits glaces, 
giving the Charlotte the appropriate names. 
608— FROZEN CHARLOTTE RUSSE. 

Line the Charlotte mold same as for No. 604, 
and fill with the whipped cream No. 602. Set 
the Charlottes in the ice cave or freezing box for 
two hours. 

To serve: turn from the molds, ice with Fond- 
ant icing, and decorate with cherries and angelica, 
or with a bright red jelly. 

Another way is to decorate with whipped cream 
in two colors, pink and white, like No. 604. 

609— CHARLOTTE WITH MACAROONS. 
CHARLOTTE WITH ALMONDS. 
CHARLOTTE WITH NUTS. 
CHARLOTTE WITH MERINGUES. 
PONCE DE LEON CHARLOTTES. 
Prepare the mixture No. 600. Add two ounces 
of crushed macaroons, flavor vanilla, fill into 
forms, and set on ice. 

Prepare small macaroons, decorate each with 
royal icing. Unmold the cream, place a border 
of whipped cream around; set the macaroons 
around the Charlotte and one on top of the 
cream, and finish the decoration with more whip- 
ped cream in fancy design. 

Charlottes with almonds, nuts, and meringues 
may be made in the same manner, using small 
macaroons, wafers or meringues for side decora- 
tion. 

6x0.— CHARLOTTE GLACE. 
Line a dome-shaped mold with a pink colored 
jelly, as indicated in No. 596. Flavor the jelly 
maraschino or port wine. After the lining is 
firmly set, fill with mixture No. 599 or 6oz, and 
set on ice till the cream becomes firm. 

To serve: dip the mold in warm water for a 
moment, and turn carefully on a shallow dish. De- 
corate with whipped cream and small macaroons. 
6x1.— CHARLOTTE BELLEVUE. 
Line the molds with a clear wine jelly. . Deco- 
rate the bottom with a star or any other fancy 



design of angelica and cherries. Fasten the fruit 
to tne sides by dipping in some jelly. When the 
lining is set, fill the centre with a pink colored 
Charlotte Russe or Bavarian Cream, flavored 
strawberry or maraschino. Set on ice till firm; 
unmold, and serve in the same manner as Char- 
lotte Glace No. 6x0. 

Another way of making this Charlotte, is to fill 
some clear wine jelly into the bottom of the mold, 
decorate with fruit; put in a cake lining, as 
described in No. 604; fill with the Charlotte mix 
ture; let set, and serve with the jelly part on 
top and the sides decorated with whipped cream. 

6x2 —BAVARIAN CREAM.

vanilla flavor. 

Soak the gelatin in a little cold water. Beat 
the double cream firm and let drain on a sieve. 
Put the sugar, yolks and plain cream on the fire; 
stir till it thickens, but do not let boil. Take off; 
stir in the gelatin; strain and add the flavor. Stir 
on ice till it begins to set, then mix with the whip- 
ped cream. Fill into the cold forms, and set on 
ice till wanted. 

To facilitate the unmolding, the molds may be 
brushed with sweet almond oil or olive oil; other- 
wise the molds have to be dipped in water for a 
moment to loosen the cream. 

After this recipe a variety of creams can be 
made, changing the flavors, to maraschino, orange, 
orange flower; or add some crushed nuts or 
browned almonds. The addition of four ounces 
of chocolate makes a nice CHOCOLATE BA- 
VARIAN CREAM.

The craams are generally served plain; but for 
more effect tbey may be decorated with whipped 
cream and French fmits. 



6X5.-BLANC. MANGE. 

Blanc-Mange means a white mizture; bnt it 
is made in a variety of colors, like the Bavarian 
creams. 

Blanc-Manges are genemlly made of a firmer 
texture than the foregoing creams, bnt may be 
greatly improved and made light by adding a part 
of whipped cream, or whites of eggs in the form 
of a meringue, to the mixture just before the 
cream thickens on ice, in the same way as for the 
Charlotte and Bavarian creams. 

616.— ALMOND BLANC-MANGE. 

z quart of milk, i quart of cream, 12 ozs. sugar, 

2 ozs. gelatin, }^ lb. almonds, a few bitter almonds

The Blanc-Manges may be made with fresh 
berries in season, adding the berries in layers 
between the cream. 



623.-FRENCH CREAMS. 

CREMES A LA FRANCAIS. 
The French Creams consist of custards, which 
are set with gelatin, and made light by beating 
the custard on ice till the gelatin begins to set, 
same way as for the bhmc-mange. 

624.— FRENCH VANILLA CREAM. 

CREME FRANCAIS A LA VANILLE. 
3 pints of cream, X2 ozs. of sugar, X2 yolks, 
i}i ozs. of gelatin.

63X -WHIPPED CREAM with FRUIT in cases. 

MOUSSE AU FRUITS xn caissx. 
z pint of double cream whipped to a firm froth, 
z pint of crushed fruit, z lb. sugar. i)i ozs. gelatin. 

Soak the gelatin, mix the sugar and crushed, 
fruit, heat lightly and add the gelatin; stir till 
cold, and before it sets add the whipped cream, 
and fill into molds or paper cases. Decorate with 
plain whipped cream, and serve. 

Strawberry, raspberry, apricot and peach 
mousse are prepared in this manner. 

A lighter kind of mousse can be made without 
the gelatin (for immediate use) from dry whipped 
cream. Take one quart of double cream, beat 
firm and let drain on a sieve for thirty minutes. 
Before serving add three-quarters of a pint of 
sweetened fruit pulp, and draw it lightly into the 
whipped cream. Chocolate, coffee, liquors and 
extracts may be added in place of fruits. These 
creams should be served at once, because they 
soften quickly, being without gelatin to keep them 
firm. 

In place of paper cases, meringue baskets or 
small patty cases may be used for holding the 
creams. See Nos. Z3Z, 3x7, 38Z and 396. 



BAKED CUSTARDS. 

632.— CUP CUSTARD WITH VANILLA. 

2 quarts of rich milk, Z2 ozs. of sugar, zo eggs, 

vanilla extract. 

Beat eggs and sugar and add the warmed milk; 

add flavor and a pinch of salt, fill into cups; set 



the cups in a pan with hot water and bake in a 
medium heat till done (which may be ascertained 
by inserting the blade of a thin knife in the centre 
of the custard: if the blade appears dry, the cus- 
tard is done.) 

A variety of custards may be made after this 
recipe by adding chocolate, coffee, orange or 
lemon rind or extracts, nuts or almonds, etc. 

The custards should be served iced, and may 
be served plain, or with a spoonful of whipped 
cream on top. 



633.— FRENCH CARAMEL CUSTARD. 

CREME RENVERSE AU CARAMEL. 

Boil one pound of granulated sugar to the 
caramel degree (No. 67). As soon as it turns to 
a golden color, add a little water and reduce it to 
the soft ball degree. Fill a thin layer of this 
syrup while hot into the bottom of timbale molds; 
let cool. Rub the sides of the molds with some 
melted butter or olive oil. Prepare the custard 
No. z6o; flavor vanilla. Fill into the molds and 
bake same as the cup custard No. 632. When 
done, take from the water and let cool. 

To serve: loosen the custard lightly from the 
sides with the tip of the finger and turn upside 
down into the dish the custard is to be served in. 
The caramel in the bottom of the mold forms a 
syrup, which serves as the sauce. 

The most particular part of this custard is the 
baking. Too much baking makes the custard 
curdle and turn watery. 

Custards with other flavors may be made after 
this recipe, to be turned from the molds when cold. 

634.— BOILED CUSTARD. 
CUSTARD CREAM. 
CUSTARD SIDE DISHES. 
2 quarts milk, zo ozs. sugar, i}i ozs. cornstarch, 
8 yolks, 5 whole eggs, flavor. 

Dissolve the starch in some cold milk. Let the 
other milk and sugar come to a boil, stir in the 
starch; takeoff the fire, pour the milk over the 
well-beaten eggs; return to the fire a moment for 
the eggs to thicken; strain and flavor. 

This custard serves for many purposes. It may 
be stirred cold on ice, or poured hot over the fruit 
or cake you intend to serve with it. 

A large variety of SIDE mSHES may be 
made with boiled custard for lunch counters and 
hotel use. by baking small cases or tart shells from 
puff-paste or pie crust or short paste; filling the 
bottom with berries, cherries or peaches; sweeten 
and pour over some custard. Or bake the fruit 
in the cases, pour over the custard and decorate 
with a meringue

63s -GELATIN JELLIES. 

These jellies are made with wines, fruit juices 
and liqaors. The gelatin is added to give firm- 
ness to the mixture, so it can be turned from the 
molds. For this reason the jellies served in 
glasses can be made more delicate, and require 
less gelatin than the jellies which have to be taken 
from the molds. 

As the gelatins are not uniform it often takes a 
little experimenting to obtain the proper results. 
The wine jellies may be made from wine only, 
but the process is too expensive. It is best to 
make a stock jelly from lemon juice, water,, sugar 
and spices, and add the wine or liquors. 

For the Fruit jellies the fruit juice is filtered and 
mixed with even quantities of simple syrup No. 6x, 
to which the gelatin is added. It is advisable to use 
a little more gelatin during the summer months, 
or in places where the jellies are served in a hot 
kitchen. The warm atmosphere keeps the jellies 
soft, and if not sufficient gelatin is added the 
jellies run flat or break, and become unfit to serve. 

A jelly is best if made the day before using it, 
so it may be well set before it is served. 

636.— STOCK JELLY. 
8 OSS. gelatin, 4^ quarts of water, 3 lbs. sugar, 
zo lemons, the rind of z orange and 2 lemons, 
z OS. mixed spices (consisting of whole cloves, 
allspice, cinnamon and a blade of mace), 
7 whites of eggs, and the clean shells of the eggs. 

Soak the gelatin in the water for half an hour, 
add the strained juice of the lemons, the spices, 
the rind and sugar, the clean egg shells, crushed, 
and the whites beaten up half. 

For the boiling use a large pan or kettle which 
holds about three or four gallons, as the jelly rises 
considerably during boiling. 

Set on the fire and let come to a slow boil; let 
boil for about ten minutes from the time it begins 
to boil, or till the whites of eggs curdle. Take 
off the fire and let rest for a moment. Wet the 
flannel or felt jelly bag in hot water, wring it and 
hang in the jelly box; fill with the jelly; let run 
into a clean basin, and return it to the bag several 
times, till it runs perfectly clear. Keep the bag 
well covered in a ¥rarm place till the jelly has all 
run through. 

Add to this jelly one quart of wine, or one pint 
of liquor, as directed; add appropriate colors, fill 
into molds; let rest on ice from four to five hours, 
or till ready to serve. 

To use: dip the mold in hot water for a second 
and turn out on the dish to be served in. 

Bright, shallow glass dishes are the be^t for 
serving jellies. They may be served in a border 
of whipped cream; or a part of the jelly may be 



colored in an opposite color, filled into a shallow 
pan in a thin layer about one-quarter inch deep, 
and after it is hardened cut into small diamonds, 
stars or crescents and used for decoration. 

From this Stock Jelly all the different wine and 
liquor jellies can be made without giving a sepa- 
rate recipe for each jelly. 

637.— RIBBON JELLY. 

GELEE A LA POUSSE CAF£. 
Take from the clear Stock Jelly. Flavor one 
part maraschino, color pink; one part creme de 
men the, color light green; one part Chartreuse, 
or sherry color (dark yellow); leave one part clear, 
flavor with white wine. Fill the jelly in alternate 
colors into high narrow glasses, letting each layer 
set before adding the next layer. Finish the top 
with whipped cream, sweetened and flavored, and 
serve. 

638.— CHAMPAGNE JELLY. 

Make the Stock Jelly lightly spiced; add one 
quart of dry sweet caUwba, or any other white 
wine of good flavor. Cool the jelly on ice till it 
nearly sets. Beat the jelly with the egg-beater 
lightly till some bubbles appear in the jelly. The 
bubbles are caught in the setting jelly, and a part 
will rise to the top, forming a white froth. Fill 
at once into champagne glasses and set on ice. 

The foam on tlie top becomes firm, and the 
rising bubbles in the centre make it look like real 
champagne. 

For a more expensive Champagne Jelly, one pint 
of champagne may be added to the setting jelly 
at the proper moment, so the bubbles are caught 
in the jelly, which will make it still more real. 

A very nice jelly of this kind may be made by 
adding ginger ale or sparkling cider to plain jelly, 
and finish like the Champagne Jelly. For a hoax, 
a straw may be placed into the glass, or a cherry 
in the centre of the jelly to make it look like a 
cocktail, etc. 

A more plain way of making Champagne Jelly 
is to fill the glasses pardy with clear jelly; beat 
some jelly light, adding some beaten whites of 
eggs, and fill on top of the clear jelly. 

639.— WINE AND LIQUOR JELLIES WITH 
FRUIT. 
Take a clear wine or liquor jelly, fill one layer 
of jelly in the bottom of the small individual 
molds, put on ice till the jelly is set Place oq 
top of the jelly half a preserved peach or apricotg 
or take a round slice of pineapple. Place a cherry 
in the centre, or use fresh ripe berries of any kind, 
putting them in symmetrically. On top of the 
fruit fill more jelly which is almost ready to set 
Place on ice to get firm. 



72 



PAUL RICHARD'S BOOK OF BRBAD8, CAKBS, PABTRIXS, ICBS AND SWBBTMBATS. 



To nnmold: dip the mold in hot water a second, 
tarn over on dish, and serve in a border of whip- 
ped cream. 

640.— SWISS PEACH MERINGUE. 

Line a dome-shaped jelly mold with a pink 
colored marschino jelly, then place half a pre- 
served peach in the bottom and fill some more of 
the jelly over the fruit, and set cold to become 
firm. Prepare the Charlotte Rosse Cream No. 
601 and fill on top of the fmit. 

To serve: turn out so the fruit appears on top. 
Serve in a border of whipped cream. 

64X.— MACEDOINE OF FRUIT. 

Line a jelly mold with a clear liquor jelly. 
After the jelly has set, put in one layer of straw- 
berries or raspberries; pour over a little jelly and 
let set. Put on one layer of ripe peaches cut in 
dice; more jelly; then a layer of blackberries or 
blue grapes; a little more jelly, and a layer of 
green grapes, etc., and continue in alternating 
layers till the form is filled. Keep on ice till firm 
and serve with whipped cream, or with a cold 
cream sauce. 

For a large party this jelly may be made very 
attractive in a border mold with a large centre 
tube; filling the centre, after the jelly is turned 
from the mold, with whipped cream. Or, by 
making a separate Bavarian cream in a mold 
which fits into the centre of the border mold, and 
place this :n the centre when ready to serve. 

The macedoines may be made with any fruit in 
season, or in combination with French fruits 
glaces, or preserved fruits. 

The French fruits should be softened in a 
liquor syrup before using. 

642.— STRAWBERRY AND RASPBERRY 

JELLIES WITH GELATIN. 

z quart water, x quart fruit juice, 2 lbs. sugar, 

3 ozs. gelatin. 

Soak the gelatin, make a clear syrup of the 

. water and sugar, filter the fruit juice same way as 

for fruit syrups (see No. 58). Add the gelatin to 

the hot syrup, and mix with the fruit juice. Add 

a little coloring, if required; fill into forms, like 

other jellies. 

643.— ORANGE JELLY. 

Take one pint of simple syrup No. 6x. Have 
it very dear. Press the juice of twelve oranges 
and two lemons to make one pint of juice; add 
one and one-half ounces of soaked gelatin to the 
warm syrup, and mix syrup and the filtered juice. 
Fill into forms, let become firm and serve. 

A favorite way f serving this jelly is to cut 
baskets from oranges, scallop the sides and handle 



and remove the pulp. The juice may be used for 
the jelly. Set the baskets on ice, or, better, in a 
freezing closet to get firm, and fill with the jelly. 
Decorate with cherries and angelica. 

The jelly may be served as a ribbon jelly, one 
part colored a deep red, like blood orange, and 
the other part orange yellow; and filled into the 
forms in alternating layers. 

644 —LEMON JELLY. 

Prepare like the Orange Jelly No. 643. Use 
one pound of sugar, one and one-half ounces of 
gelatin, the juice of ten lemons, and enough water 
to make one quart syrup and juice. 

Other jellies of this kind can be made in the 
same proportions, using one pint of strong 
coffee or tea, with one pint of syrup; or one pint 
of wine, with the same amount of gelatin. 

The juice of some lemons may be added and 
clarified with the syrup to liquor jellies; also to 
jellies with the flavor of orange flower or violets 
and roses. 

645.— PUNCH JELLY. 
Prepare the Orange or Lemon Jelly, Nos. 643 
and 644, and flavor with some good rum. 

646.— CRUSHED FRUITS AND COMPOTES 
OF FRUIT IN FORMS. 
Prepare berries and other fruits in the same 
way as for marmalade (see Preserves No. 13). 
Use ten ounces of sugar to each quart of fruit 
(more if the fmit is very tart). Stir juice and 
sugar till well dissolved and clear. Warm lightly 
and add one ounce of dissolved gelatin. Stir 
slowly on ice till it begins to thicken, then fill into 
forms. Let become firm and serve with cream. 

647.— COMPOTE OF MIXED FRUITS. 

Line a large compote or melon form with a 
clear wine or maraschino jelly. Take a mixed 
compote of fruit, or use preserved fruit, as 
cherries, peaches, apricots, greengages, plums, 
etc. Dry the fruit in a clean towel, dip each 
fruit in jelly and arrange it in contrasting layers 
tastefully in the form, filling a little of the jelly 
between the layers till the form is filled. Let be- 
come firmly set, nnmold and serve. 

Whole fresh strawberries and raspberries may 
be served in this manner, or the sides of the form 
only may be decorated with the berries; fastening 
the fmit to the jelly lining with nearly set jelly, 
and fill the centre of the decorated form with the 
Charlotte russe mixtures. 

Pineapples, pears, apples and other fmit may 
be used in exactly the same manner With the 
assistance of some cherries and angelica these 
dishes can be made very attractive.

703.-ICE CREAM MAKING. 

The best and richest loo CfMins anmade ifom 
double cream, with the addition of jolka of eggs, 
sngar and flavorings; while some of the cheapest 
commercial creams are made from milk only, with- 
oat eggs, and are thickened with gelatin, corn- 
starch, arrowroot, sago and other preparations. 

The rich crsams are known as NEAPOLITAN or 
ITAIJAN creams, and also as FRENCH creams. 
The original creams of this class were frozen in 
the old time hand freezers and worked with the 
spatnla. This process makes a firm and more 
solid cream, and is in general use in Enrope; 
while over here the patent freezers are used, 
which prodnoe a more balky and lighter kind of 
Ice Cream. 

The rich creams which contain eggs and cream 
frozen in patent freezers are also termed NEW 
YORK creams, and the lighter creams, made from 
the best cream and withoat eggs, PHILADEL- 
PHIA creams. 

Select a good Ice Cream freezer. There are 
good ones, and others not worth the material 
they are made of. BUY THE BEST. A good 
copper freezing can is a little expensive at first, 
bat is the best, becanse it can be retianed as often 
as xeqtured; while freezing cans of tinned iron or 
steel are often an entire loss. When the tin weara 
off, they get rasty and discolor the creams and ices. 

The ice tab should be wide enough to have four 
inches or more of space around the freezing can 
for the ice and salt. Have two holes made in the 
tub— A small half-inch hole about one inch below 
the top of the freezing can, which is left open 
during the freezing, td prevent the brine from 
getting into the cream: the other, a larger hole, 
near the bottom, with a plug in it to let out the 
brine. 

Other tools which are required are Ice Shovel 
and Salt Scoop, also a long wooden Paddle or 
Spatula, Ice Crusher, Packing Cans and Tubs, 
and an Ice Cave or Freezing Closet. 

The Ice Cave is to keep the molded creams from 
the time they are taken from the forms until they 
are served. And the cave is also required for 
freezing Biscuit Glaces, Mousses and other creams 
which are served in the cases they are frozen in. 

The Ice Caves are made in sizes to hold from 
four to forty quarts. They are generally made 
from galvanized iron, with changeable shelves and 
neks. The cave is set into a wooden tub, or in a 



square unc-lined boa, laige enoa^ to leave aboat 
four inches of space around the cave for the ice 
and salt; also provided with a plugged-np hole 
near the bottom to ler out the water. 

To freeze the cream : Set the can in the centre 
of the tub on the pin on which it revolves; cover 
and pack with ice and salt, in proportion of one 
part of salt to from three to four parts of ice. 
Start the machine, or turn the crank, at a slow 
even speed. A slow motion freezes the cream 
more rapidly than a fast motion will. Too much 
speed is often injurious to the cream, and is liable 
to chum it into butter, or make it coarse. The 
time of freezing differs according to the richness 
of the mixtures and the strength of the brine, but 
it can be timed by the clock, if uniform mixtures 



When the cream is frozen, remove the dasher, 
scrape down and work well with the spatula. 

One kind of cream can be made into the differ- 
ent varieties after it is frozen to this point, by 
adding Crushed Fruits, Nuts, Coloring and Flavor. 
After this the cream may be transferred in pack- 
ing cans, or left in the f reering can and packed in 
ice and salt for one hour or more to ripen. This 
makes the cream richer and of better flavor. 

The rich Creams and Ices which contain much 
sugar are not suited for molding. To obtain a 
firm cream for this purpose, one pound and twelve 
ounces of sugar to the gallon of cream is the most 
suitable amount to be used, especially for laige 
pieces. 

The WATER ICES cannot be exactly gradu- 
ated by measuring the water and weighing the 
sugar for molding, and practical Ice Cream 
makers use the saccharimeter, or syrup scale, to 
obtain uniform results. 

When Ices are made in large quantities, the 
sjrrup scale should be used. It is the only meana 
to ascertain if the quality is correct. 

Fruits require sjrrups of different richness, 
according to the sweetness or acidity they contain. 
The thickness of the syrups change with the 
temperature, and a standard has been adopted at 
which the syrups must be weighed; the hot syrup 
must be cooled down to 80* Fahr., which is best 
suited for fruit syrups. 

The Beanm^ syrup scale is graduated from one 
to fifty-five degrees, and at a temperature of 80* 
Fahr. of the syrup, this list is best suited for fruit 
Ices:

To test the symp, fill a high narrow vessel, or 
a glass stand of about ten to twelve inches in 
height, with it, and set in a pail of water of 80^ 
Fahr. When the symp is of the same tempera- 
ture, pnt in the scale. If the symp requires more 
sugar, the scale will sink below the given degree, 
and more sugar should be added until it comes up. 
If it contains too much sugar, the scale rises above 
the required degree, and more water is added un- 
til it comes down to it. 

For the large fancy pieces, and also for the 
smaller forms, fill the molds solid with the Creams 
or Ices to prevent air-holes. Fill each half of the 
form a little more than full and press both sides 
well together. The large molds should be sealed 
with butter and tied with a string or wire, to pre- 
vent the salt getting into the cream. The small 
individual forms hardly require these precautions, 
if they are close fitting. Brick molds should be 
made to have two covers, that is, top and bottom; 
and the covers should fit OVER the mold, not 
IN the mold. The form opening on both sides 
makes it easy to take out the frozen creams. 

When filling the brick molds, line the bottom 
with manilla paper, fill the form a little more than 
full, level it and place another piece of paper on 
the top; press the cover down well, tie up and 
pack in ice and salt. 

The large molds take from two to four hours to 
freeze; the small individual molds may be frozen 
in from fifteen to thirty minutes. 

To unmold the creams: Wipe ofif the brine, dip 
the form for a moment in warm water; wipe dry, 
and slip the cream onto a platter, or on the table. 
The bricks may be cut in slices as ordered, or all 
cut in portions, each slice wrapped in wax paper, 
ready to serve, and kept in the ice cave. 

While many of the colors may be produced by 
using the different creams and ices in molding, 
some of the fancy figures require a little touching 
up with artificial colors. The colors are diluted 
with a little syrup. A small brush is used for 
painting. Some colors are also used in powder 
form, put in a muslin bag, which is very handy 
for making red cheeks on fruit and figures, etc. 

To make fruits and flowers look still more 
natural, fresh leaves and stems are used when in 
season. The artificial leaves, stems and petals 
can be bought all the year around in supply 
stores. 

Some Ice Cream makers dip the creams which 
represent frozen fruits, after painting, in cold 



water for a moment, and put them back in the 
ice cave; this process forms a thin transparent 
crust, which resembles the skin of the fruit, be- 
sides keeping the frozen cream in better shape. 

With a variety of small forms for fruits and 
flowers, and a couple of large forms for freesing 
baskets, vases and stands from colored wator or 
ices, many nice centre pieces may be produced. 

The unmolding of the creams should be done 
in a cold place and as speedily as possible to pre- 
vent the softening of the creams. The dishes on 
which the creams are served should also be kept 
on ice till wanted. 

It is best to serve molded creams on lace paper 
doylies, to prevent sliding on the plates. 

For flavoring, use the fresh fruits as much as 
possible; and, if not in season, the preserved fruit 
and fruit juices, vanilla beans, and the rind ci 
oranges and lemons. 

There are very many good extracts of vanilla, 
lemons and oranges, but strawberry, raspberry, 
pineapple, and many other extracts should be 
used with caution, as the most of them are made 
artificial, and after some time turn rancid and 
become unfit for use. 

The use of colors is of t«m required to obtain the 
right shade in molding, and it is cheapest and 
best to buy the colors ready made. 

THE STORING AND KEEPING OF CREAMS 
AND ICES. 

Where several kinds of creams and ices are 
kept on hand, it is profitable to have a storage box 
built with double sides like an ice box, lined with 
zinc, and large enough to keep the creams packed 
in ice and salt. It is best to make a box like this 
in two or three partitions, each with a separate 
outlet in the bottom to let out the brine; so they 
all may be used at one time, or one part of it 
only, if business is slack and to save ice. 

Lately storage boxes have come into use in 
hotels where they have a cold storage system. 
Where the brine system is used in place of ice 
and salt, the cover of the storage box should be 
made in sections, and with a double lid, the outer 
cover to be fastened with hinges, and the inside 
cover (which has to be opened only when the 
cream is to be repacked) to lift out. In the in- 
side cover are to be cut circular openii^^s to fit 
over the packing cans, which also may be covered. 
This is the best kind of box for storing and keep- 
ing creams, and saves ice and money. 

Porcelain lined cans are the best for keeping 
ices and creams. The best tinned cans, if the 
creams are kept for a longer time, cause an un- 
pleasant metallic taste, while poorly tinned cans 
spoil and discolor the creams. 



80 PAUL RICHAltI>S BOOK OF BRBAD8, CAKXS, PASTRIES, ICB8 AND SWBXTMSATS. 

Bulk Ice Creams and Ices should be worked fined to two Southern hotels, and I cannot say that 

over once or twice a day to prevent graining, and the system always worked satisfactory, or as good, 

repacked as often as required. or better, than the ice-and-salt-freezing process.

756.— SHERBETS. 
GItANITOS. 

Fmit Ices made light by the addition of whites 
of eggs or gelatin are called SHERBETS. 

The Sherbets should be of a lighter texture 
than the ices, and it is preferable to use a lighter 
dymp; that is, more water or less sugar. 

About two ounces less of sugar for each quart 
of water, and one white of egg beaten Ught, 
makes a perfect Sherbet from all the Fmit Ices 
given in former chapter. 

GRAMITOS are Sherbets froeen witfaoat much 
stirring. This process makes them more granular 
and icy* Th^ are better if made without the 
use of symp. The sugar Is dissolved in the cold 
water and mixed with fruit and juices, packed in 



ice and salt and frozen to a mush without turning; 
using the spatula to loosen it from the sides. The 
Granito is served in glasses like the Sherbets. 

757— LEMON SHERBET. 
4 lbs. sugar, 5 quarts of water, 12 lemons. 
Make sugar and water into a symp, let infuse 
with the grated rind of six lemons, add the juice

whites of eggs: or, add one-half ounce of soaked 
gelatin in place of the whites, to the symp while

Many of the other fmit sherbets may be pre- 
pared like the ices, using one more quart of 
water and four beaten whites of eggs for each 
gallon before freezing. 

759.— APPLE SHERBET.

and add one stick of cinnamon. As soon as the 
apples are soft, take off the fire; add the sugar, 
the grated rind of half a lemon, and the juice of 
the eight lemons. Cool, strain, add four beaten 
whites of eggs and freeze.

Cream* Take twelve whole eggs and one pound 
of sugar, beat together, first warm and then cold, 
like for sponge cake. When the cream is about 
half frozen, add this mixture and finish freezing. 
Incorporate one pint of brandy and one pint of 
ram, and serve with some grated nutmeg on top 
of each glass. 

If a richer mixture is required, take only two 
quarts of cream and all the other ingredients. 

Another way of making this punch, is to take 
twenty-four yolks, one pound of sugar, one quart 
of sherry, one pint of rum, three pints of whipped 
cream. Beat yolks and sugar together; add the 
wine and set on a slow fire, or in boiling water. 
Stir constantly till the mixture begins to thicken. 
Take off the fire and beat cold on ice. Place in 
the freezer and freeze smooth, then add the rum, 
and last, the whipped cream. Draw the cream 
in lightly without much stirring. Serve at once,

825.— GLAC£S. 

MOUSSES GLACfiES. 

The frozen Mousses are simply whipped ciaam« 
sweetened and flavored with fruits, extracts, etc 

To make these Glac^ perfect, good double 
cream is required, which should be two days old. 
The cream is beaten cold to a firm froth and set 
on ice to drain in a sieve. After the cream is 
drained, it is sweetened with powdered sugar or 
syrup, fruit pulps, chopped nuts or macaroons, 
etc. ; filled into melon or brick molds; packed in 
ice and salt, and frozen. 

The small individual Glac^, also the Biscuit 
Glac^ are filled into paper cases and frozen in 
the ice cave. 

Another way to make the Glao^ is to prepaza 
the mixture same as for Charlotte Russe, with a 
small quantity of gelatin (see No. 607). The 
mixing of the whipped cream with the other in- 
gredients should be dode without too much stir* 
ring, in order to keep the creams as light as pos- 
sible. 

826.— VANILLA GLACft. 

Beat one quart of double cream to a firm froth, 
drain on ice in sieve for thirty minutes, sweeten 
with eight ounces of powdered sugar; flavor with 
vanilla extract Fill the mixture into molds or 
and freeze as directed. 



827.— FRUIT GLACfi.

Mix fruit pulp with the sugar, and make a 
syrup; add to the whipped cream and mix care- 
fully. Fill into forms and freeze. 

A favorite way of serving the fruits Glac^ is to 
take melon or bomb forms, line the sides with ice 
creams or water ices in contrasting colors, and fill 
the centre with the mousse preparation. 

More fruit and sugar can be used, but it makes 
a less lighter mixture, and an addition of gelatin 
is required to keep the mousse from getting too 
heavy.

These creams are not so difficult to make, as it 
may seem at first; and for caterers and hotels 
where several kinds of creams and ices are always 
kept on hand, these combinations are easily made 
and often constitute a saving, because small 
quantities of left-over creams and ices may be 
combined in this manner and used with profit. 

Some of the combination creams which contain 
liquors, or additions of biscuits, macaroons and 
fruits, may be served as a frozen pudding, with 
a suitable sauce.

•erved in heart-shaped cases, or the creams 
may be frozen in heart-shaped forms. 

For Washington's Birthday, hatchet-shaped 
cases may be used, decorated with candied 
cherries and angelica stems and leaves. Three- 
cornered hats may be made from wafer mix- 
tures, and filled with cream. The Washington 
Gup No. 754 may also be served. 

For St. Patrick's Day, Pistachio Ice Cream 
frozen in harp shapes is very appropriate. 
Also Irish potatoes frozen in molds the shape 
and size of potatoes; outside, Chocolate or 
Caramel Ice Cream; centre, Vanilla Ice Cream 
with a couple of maraschino cherries, and 
served with a cream sauce. Potatoes may also 
be made from Marcipan Paste. The Cup 
Lipton may also be served, see No. 752. 

For Easter, the creams may be frozen in 
egg-shaped forms in various colors; or the 
meringue shells filled with frozen creams and 
ices.

Punch No. 785, or the American Cup No. 751. 



The glacis may be served in drum-shaped cases; 
or ice cream may be frozen in brick form, in 
layers representing the American flag, Old 
Glory with the thirteen original stars and 
stripes. 

Many of the frozen creams in brick form are 
very delicious, if served with a sauce. One of 
these favorites is Vanilla Ice Cream with choco- 
late sauce; another is Bisque or Nut Ice Cream 
with maple syrup sauce. The maple sauce is 
made by reducing one pound of maple sugar 
with half a pint of water to a thick syrup. 
For cold chocolate sauce see No. 443. 

Frozen individual Fruit Creams may be 
frozen without molds, using the fruit. Remove 
the inside of solid bananas or oranges; cut the 
inside of apples and pears, leaving a thin shell. 
Place the shells in the ice cave or freezer to 
harden, then fill with frozen cream and serve. 

These creams are made still more beautiful 
if served in baskets made from ices or creams, 
or molded from nougat or meringue placed on 
another tray on which they are handed around.

878.-BREADMAKING. 

To make good bread, there are three things 
required: First, good flour; second, good 
yeast; and third, a person with practice and 
experience, who knows how to use flour and 
yeast to make bread out of it. 

Most difficulties for bakers arise from the 
variety of flours in use. Almost every section 
of this country produces flours of different 
qualities. Bakers used to Eastern flours often 
have trouble going West, and have to learn 
the use of these flours before they are able to 
make good bread. Flours of different qualities 
require more or less fermentation and different 
treatment in sponge and doughs. 

The varieties of wheat are divided into 
spring wheat and winter wheat. The winter 
wheat is planted in the fall, and the spring 
wheat in the early spring. The best grade of 
spring wheat, the hard red spring wheats, have 
come from the Northwest, from Minnesota, 
Dakota and Manitoba. The Southwest, espe- 
cially Kansas, also Texas and Oklahoma, raise 
a good hard red winter wheat which makes good 
bread flours. The winter wheats are known as 
hard and soft red winter wheat and soft white 
winter wheat. The soft grades are mostly used 
for cake and pastry flours; the others are used 
in blends with spring wheat flours. 

The Oregon and California wheats make a 
flour of good color and*flavor, but because they 
contain much starch, they are classed among 
the weak bread flours. 

It is a well known fact that winter wheat 
flours possess a better flavor, and give more 
moisture to the bread; for this reason the 
various kinds of spring and winter wheat flours 
are blended into mixtures which give a good 
flavor to the breads and at the same time a 
larger loaf. 

The mills and the large modern bakeries have 
laboratories, in which grains and flours are 
tested before milling or baking, to ascertain 
their bread-making qualities, which enables 
them to turn out a uniform blend of flour. The 
process of testing is done on a scientific basis, 
which requires a technical knowledge of chem- 
istry. The blending is done by complicated 
sifting machinery. Therefore, it is best for the 
small baker to use a standard brand of flour; 
the brand is the trademark of the miller, and 
is generally kept at a uniform quality. 

A plain test for flour, is to place several 
samples side by side on a board or stiff paper 
and smooth them with a knife as much as possi- 



ble. In this manner flour is tested for its 
freedom from bran and for color. The strong 
bread flours have a yellow color and a sharp 
granular feel when rubbed between the fingers, 
while the weaker flours are more white of color 
and feel smooth and heavy in the hand. 

Another simple test is to take even quantities 
of the different samples, say an ounce of each, 
and mix with even parts of water into a paste; 
the fiour which makes the firmest paste is the 
strongest and yields the most bread. 

Even the best known brands of flour change 
with every season, and it requires constant 
watching to get uniform bread, even with the 
same brands. The most difficulties are ex- 
perienced with newly-milled flours. Bakers 
always try to keep a supply of old flour on 
hand. Newly-milled wheat flour shows less ex- 
pansion in the dough, and in baking proves 
slower than flours which have been stored and 
aired for several months. Wheat flour improves 
with age, gets whiter and of better proving 
qualities. 

Flour is best stored in a well-aired room of 
moderate temperature. It should not be kept 
near strong-smelling substances, because it ab- 
sorbs odors readily and would make the bread 
unfit for use. 

All the flours should be sifted before using. 
This makes a lighter bread and removes all 
kinds of things, like barrel tacks, strings, etc., 
etc., often found in flours. 

Graham flour is the unbolted wheat meal, but 
in many of these flours the best part of the 
flour has been taken out, or it is made of the 
poorest grades of wheat. For breadmaking it 
is best to mix some strong patent flour with it, 
to make good bread. 

Whole wheat flour, or entire wheat flour, is 
made of the better grades of wheat, with a part 
of the bran or all of it removed. 

Gluten flour, or Health flour, is used to some 
extent in sanitariums and hotels. It is a wheat 
flour which should contain very little or no 
starch at all. It is made into bread for dia- 
betic patients. 

RYE FLOUB. 
The best and whitest rye flours are made 
from the centre of the grains, like the wheat 
patent flours. Generally only the bran is taken 
from the rye flours, which makes a darker flour, 
but of a more pronounced rye flavor. Many of 
the rye flours in the market are blended with 
the darker grades of wheat flour. This is done 
partly to improve the breadmaking qualities, to

make a larger loaf, and also to work off cheap 
wheat flours. 

Bje meal is made like the graham flour, and 
is used for the class of rye bread called "pum- 
pernickel. ' ' 

While wheat flour improves with age, rye 
flour is better if used fresh from the mill. Old 
rye loses much of the rye flavor. 

Corn meal and corn flour is used in bread- 
making. Corn flour is generally used mixed 
with wheat flour. The blended flour has the 
color and the sharp granular feel of the strong 
wheat flours, but the strength of the pure wheat 
flour is lacking. Corn meal is used in some 
breads. It is scalded and made into a mush, 
which is added to the dough. This process 
makes bread which retains moisture longer than 
the ordinary way of bread-making. Eye flour 
and corn flour blended, is also used in Europe 
to make a cheaper grade of bread. 

879.— ABOUT YEAST. 
Leaven in some form has been used for many 
thousands of years. The oldest leaven consisted 
of a piece of old dough left from the previous 
baking, and this method is still used to some ex- 
tent in Europe. 

The old dough preceded stock yeast, ferment, 
brewer's yeast and distiller's yeast. Stock yeast 
and ferment is still used by many bakers, be- 
cause they claim it makes a better bread, and 
keeps it moister. Compressed distiller's yeast 
is preferred by most of the bakers, because it is 
stronger, more uniform and reliable; not so 
readily influenced by atmospheric changes as 
the stock yeast. It is more convenient to use 
and a great saver of time and labor. 

Yeast develops best at a temparture of from 
75* to 90** Fahrenheit. Excessive heat will 
spoil yeast, kill the yeast germ; and great care 
should be taken when dissolving yeast not to 
scald it. A bake-shop should be laid out so 
as to keep an even temperature, free from 
drafts ; should have a proof -box or closet where 
heat can be introduced to raise the bread and 
rolls after they are molded. The large bakeries 
pay strict attention to the temperature in bread- 
making. The temperature of the flour and 
water is taken before doughing. There are 
special doughing and proving rooms. The latest 
in this line, and also the most practical, is a 
refrigerating room to control the dough. In the 
hot summer months, when the temperature rises 
up to 90 ** Fahr., and more, this is of a decided 
advantage, as there is no danger of the dough 
getting too old or sour, and it enables the baker 
to turn out a uniform loaf of bread. Sudden 
changes in temperature influence yeast, and 
often are the cause of bad bread. In the winter 
time yeast works slower and more of it is re- 



quired to raise the bread. The strong flours re- 
quire more yeast, or a stronger fermentation, 
than the weak flours. Soft water raises better 
and assists the yeast, while hard water retards 
fermentation. 

Salt is used in yeast sometimes as a preserva- 
tive, and it should be put in the yeast only after 
fermentation is complete. Where yeast is 
made fresh often, salt is better left out. In 
breadmaking it is used as a flavor, and also 
as a check on fermentation. Larger quantities 
may be used in the hot season to prevent sour- 
ing. Salt should not be used in setting sponge; 
it is better if used in doughing. In the rarified 
air of high mountainous countries yeast raises 
quicker than in the low lands. 

880.— COMPRESSED YEAST. 
Compressed yeast is a by-product of distil- 
leries. Rye, com or malt undergoes the regular 
process of fermentation necessary for the mak- 
ing of spirits. The yeast is taken from the 
tubs at a certain time, and is pressed through 
silken bags of different grades of fineness. The 
yeast so obtained goes through a chemical test 
before it is placed on the market, to keep a 
uniform article. Compressed yeast should al- 
ways be used fresh, but where it cannot be had 
regularly, it will keep for months in a jar of 
cold water; the yeast settles on the bottom and 
the water covering prevents air spoiling the 
yeast. It is best kept in the ice box, and the 
water changed twice a week. To use it, pour 
off the water carefully, take out what is needed 
with a spoon and pour fresh water over the re- 
maining yeast. If the water gets too warm, 
the yeast will rise to the top and spoil. Yeast 
will also keep frozen for a long time. Before 
using, it should be thawed slowly in cold water. 

Compressed yeast is used for setting sponge 
and for straight doughs; also for starting stock 
yeast and potato ferment. 

881.— VIRGIN YEAST. 
MAIDEN YEAST. 
Making yeast from the beginning is not much 
practised, because the dry hop yeast cake and 
fresh compressed yeast cake can be had at al- 
most any place to start a batch of stock yeast 
with; and even the large distilleries retain 
some yeast of previous batches to start the next 
batch. It may be made on a small scale in this 
manner: Take a handful of hops and boil in 
a quart of water for half an hour; strain off 
the hops and put the liquor in a strong bottle 
with a handful of malt and a little sugar; cork 
up and tie securely with wire, and let it stand 
in a warm place for forty-eight hours. Then it 
will be ready to start about two gallons of stock 
with. 



PAUL RICBARD8' BOOK OF BRBADt, CAMM9, PA8TRIBS. ICX8 AND 8WXSTMSATS. 



882.— MAIDEN YEAST. 
MALT YEAST. 
Boil half a pound of hops with four gallons 
of water for one hour; cool down to 170^ Fahr. 
and mash with six pounds of malt for one hour ; 
add half a pound of sugar and strain it in 
the yeast tub, a long narrow tub like an ice 
cream tub. Set this in a warm place, well cov- 
ered. Fermentation begins in one day; and 
in forty-eight hours, or when fermentation 
ceases, it is ready for use. This is a pure malt 
yeast, and a better result and a stronger yeast 
is obtained from this recipe, if stocked with 
four ounces of compressed yeast, or with one 
quart of previous stock, or eight dry hop yeast 
cakes dissolved in water. Before adding the 
yeast, the liquid should be cooled down to 80^ 
Fahr. It may be got ready in from twenty-four 
to thirty-six hours, according to the strength of 
the yeast and temperature. 

883.— STOCK YEAST. 
Take five ounces of hops, two pounds of malt, 
three and one-half pounds of flour, Ave gal- 
lons of water, two quarts of stock yeast, or eight 
dry yeast cakes, or three ounces of compressed 
yeast. Boil the hops and water for one hour; 
strain and scald the flour with a part of the 
water into a smooth paste. Cool the hop water 
to 165^ Fahr.; add the malt, and let mash and 
cool down to 85 degrees, about blood warm. 
Strain and wash off the malt; add the flour 
paste and the stock yeast, either the liquid 
stock, or compressed yeast, or dry yeast. Put 
away in a warm place, well covered, till ready. 
If compressed yeast is used, it will be ready 
in about thirty-six hours, or sooner. When the 
yeast is ready, fermentation ceases, and the 
liquid gets dear; two ounces of salt may be 
added, and the stock put in a cold place to 
keep. It is best to make fresh stock twice a 
week. For sponge, take one quart to each pail 
of water; for ferment, take one quart to start 
four gallons of ferment. 

884.— POTATO FERMENT. 
Peel or wash well a peck of good potatoes; 
boil till soft. Put three pounds of flour into 
the yeast tub; put the hot potatoes on the flour 
with a part of the water, and mash into a 
paste'; put more water to it, to make up two 
pails (twenty quarts) ; have it about lukewarm. 
Stock away with two quarts of stock, or four 
ounces compressed yeast; cover and set aside. 
This ferment will be ready in from twelve to 
twenty-four hours, according to the tempera- 
ture. It will come up like a sponge, and fall 
when ready. It may be used to set sponge, or 
for straight doughs, with or without addition 
of more water. 

In making yeasts and ferment, the utensils 



used should be kept perfectly clean and sweet, 
to prevent contamination. 

885.— DRY YEAST CAKE. 

The dry yeast cakes are made from strong 
stock yeast, which is thickened with com meal 
into a paste, and dried in form of small cakes, 
in which conditioii they keep a long time. 

They are made in the following manner: Take 
good strong stock yeast and make into a paste 
with corn meal. Roll out one-half inch in thick- 
ness; dust with more meal and cut in one-inch 
squares. Let dry thoroughly in a warm place, 
and put away for use. This yeast works very 
slow in sponges, but if given plenty of time 
gets as strong as other yeasts. It is best to 
dissolve the dry cakes in warm water, with 
some yeast food added, which may consist of 
sugar, grape-sugar, glucose, boiled cornstarch, 
or malt. Let it stand in a warm place till it 
starts to work, and then use it in sponge, stock 
yeast, or ferment. 

886.— SALT-RISING BREAD. 

This is also a fermented bread. The yeast 
or leaveYi to start with is made on the same 
principle as the Maiden Yeast No. 881. The 
making of this bread requires heat from start 
to finish. Corn meal is scalded with milk, to 
which a pinch of soda is added, into a soft 
batter; the batter is kept well covered in a 
warm place till fermentation has made it light. 
To this yeast a sponge is set with wheat flour 
(preferably winter wheat flour) and warm 
water. When this has risen again, the dough 
is made, adding more water, sugar, salt, lard 
and flour. The dough is given a little time to 
prove and is molded into loaves, proved and 
baked. This process makes a bread of good 
flavor. 

Other methods of lightening breads are by 
means of artificial aeration, and by using some 
form of baking powder. These breads laclc the 
pleasant taste of the fermented brands. They 
may be preparea quick and easy, but will never 
displace the fermented breads. 

For the aerated breads carbonic acid gas is 
used to lighten the dough. The baking powders 
are sifted with the flour, made into dough with 
the other ingredients and baked at once. 

887.— BAKING POWDERS. 
Carbonate of ammonia, cream of tartar, and 
bicarbonate of soda used to be the only lighten- 
ing agents; but many baking powders used at 
present are made of various chemicals. A good 
home-made baking powder can be made from 
two parts of bicarbonate of soda, Ave parts of 
cream of tartar, and one part of cornstarch. 
The starch is added to prevent caking. All 
parts are powdered and well sifted together, 
and put up in air-tight cans. 



PAUL RICHARDS* BOOK OF BREADS, CaKBS, PASTRIES, ICB8 AND SWBETMBAT8. 



Cream of tartar is expensive. Tartaric acid, 
phosphate and citric acid are used, which cost 
less. The cheapest grades of baking powder 
are made with powdered alum. Here are some 
recipes used:

Cornstarch, - - 50 parts. 

To some of these powders one ounce of pow- 
dered turmeric is added, and they are sold as 
Egg Baking Powder. 

888.— BAKING POWDEBS. 
Bicarbonate of soda and sour milk are also 
used. One teaspoonful of soda should be 
used to one pint of sour milk, but as the acidity 
of the sour milk is not always alike, less of 
the soda may be required to neutralize the same 
amount of sour mOk. 

889.— SPONGE AND DOUGH. 
STRAIGHT DOUGH. 

Both of these systems are widely used. The 
sponge method is used because it enables the 
baker to make different kinds of doughs out of 
one large sponge, and it saves yeast. 

For the sponge, flour, yeast and water are 
made into a soft dough, which can be got ready 
in a shorter or longer time, by using more or 
less yeast and raising or lowering the tempera- 
ture; also, by making a slacker or tighter 
sponge: that is, to use more or less flour in 
mixing. When the sponge is made, it is al- 
lowed to rise; when it gets ready, bubbles begin 
to show; after awhile they burst and throw off 
gas; the sponge flattens and drops in the cen- 
tre. This stage is termed by bakers the first 
drop. If not taken at this stage, it rises and 
drops again; this is termed the second drop. 
With a strong flour the fermentation will con- 
tinue in this manner till all the strength of the 
flour is exhausted and the sponge turns sour. 
Many bakers like to take the sponge at the 
second drop when using strong flours. They 
claim it makes a larger and whiter loaf. I 
prefer to take the sponge at the first drop, 
because it makes bread of better flavor. Old 
sponges rob the flour of flavor and make a 
tasteless bread. 

After the sponge is ready to the drop, from 
't may be taken for the different rolls, coffee 
cakes and breads; and more or less liquid and 
the other ingredients added, and made into the 
dough. For breads, generally one-third part of 



the flour is used in the sponge mixture, and two- 
thirds of it in the dough. A sponge may be 
set cool in the evening and taken in the morn- 
ing for doughing, or it may be set warm and 
slack, with more yeast, and got ready in one 
hour's time. 

A Straight Dough is made by mixing all the 
materials at one time. It can be made with 
ferment, or with compressed yeast. This process 
is termed the short process, and more yeast is 
used than for sponge doughs. The more yeast 
used the sooner it can be got ready. At a warm 
temperature, it can be got ready for the oven 
in four hours. At a cool temperature, with a 
smaller amount of yeast, it may also be made 
in the evening and taken in the morning. 

890.— MAKING THE DOUGH. 

DOUGHING. 

A dough should be thoroughly mixed and 
kneaded to make good bread. Small bakers are 
still mixing the doughs by hand, but all the 
larger bakeries use machinery; dough mixers 
are used ; the doughs can be made more rapidly, 
and uniform and thorough mixture is secured. 

Before molding, the doughs are given time to 
mature and get ripe. It is necessary for a 
baker to know when a dough is ready for mold- 
ing, and also when it has the proper proof to 
be baked. This point can be learned only by 
practical experience. The term "proof" means 
the age of the dough, which differs with the 
strength of the flour, and with the tightness of 
the doughs. When the dough gets ripe, it loses 
the green feeling and gets dry. A sponge 
dough reaches this stage sooner than a dough 
made by the straight-dough method. The 
weaker flours require a firmer dough, because 
the dough gives — gets softer after it is made. 
The strong flours give very little, and a softer 
dough can be made. In mixing the ingredients 
into the dough, it is best to add the shortening, 
butter or lard, after all the flour is added. The 
dough should be worked over several times 
after it has risen, for some time; this secures 
a close grained bread ; and should be taken for 
molding when the fermentation is strongest. A 
pan bread dough may be given less age than a 
Vienna dough and rolls dough. A young dough 
takes more color in baking and requires less 
heat. Old dough can stand more heat in baking 
without taking too much color. If the tempera- 
ture of the oven is low, give the goods less 
proof than when the temperature is high. 

891.— OVENS AND BAKING HEAT. 

There are many kinds of ovens in use, and all 

of them have some good points. The ovens 

mostly in use are the furnace brick ovens. They 

are without doubt the most practical and best 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKBS, PASTRIES. ICBS AND SWRSTICBATS. 



ovens for a small baker. They are economical 
in fuel, and burn wood as well as coal or gas. 
The only drawbacks are that the heating is 
done in the baking chamber, and nothing can 
be baked while it is heated. But these ovens 
retain the heat well, and bread, rolls, pastry 
and cakes may be baked all in one healing. 
For large bakeries, the continuous bakers are 
the most practical; the furnace is under the 
baking chamber, and the baking can be con- 
tinued during firing. The large bakers have 
specially built Vienna and other patent ovens 
for the bread and rolls, and other ovens for 
pastry and cakes. 

To bake Vienna bread and rolls and other 
hearth-baked breads, an oven is required which 
holds steam. It should have tightly fitting 
doors and dampers, and also a steam-tight oven 
light. The Vienna ovens are built to hold 
steam. They are built with a sloping hearth, 
so that the oven space is above the door. When 
the door is opened, the steam stays in the oven 
and does not escape. Other ovens have steam 
attached. The oven is filled with steam before 
the baking begins. When the bread is put into 
the oven, the steam condenses on the cooler 
dough, and in this manner forms the gloss on 
the bread. In the ordinary oven, a perforated 
steam pipe should be placed in the back of the 
oven. This brings the steam from the back to 
the front, and glazes the bread more effectually 
than when the pipe is placed in the front, as is 
often done. The steam escapes before it reaches 
the back part of the oven, when the door is 
opened to put in the bread. 

Steam can also be generated by setting an 
iron pan filled with sawdust and water in the 
oven; or a pot of water in the fire-place; or by 
rolling and tying up some bags, immersing 
them in water and laying them in one corner 
of the oven. In shelf ovens, a pan of water 
may be placed on the bottom shelf. Some 
bakers hake goods first which do not require 
steam. These goods generate enough steam to 
bake the Vienna breads and rolls. 

In Europe most all the breads are baked on 
the hearth. This gives a better flavor to the 
bread than if baked on pans or on metal oven 
soles. In this country the pan-baked breads 
predominate. 

Portable ovens are also used by many bakers 
and in the hotels. These ovens are less expen- 
sive than brick ovens, of lighter build and can 
be moved. Some of them are built after the 
style of the brick ovens, with an inside furnace 
and one baking chamber, and might be named 
movable brick ovens; others are built with 
shelves, two or three above each other. These 
ovens take up less space. 

The knowledge of the necessary heat in fur- 
nace ovens is estimated by the whiteness or 



blackness of the interior. The smoke will first 
blacken the interior, and as the heat increases 
it will clear off and become white. Practical 
bakers also can tell by holding the hand near 
the oven door or in the oven. Another test is 
to throw a handful of flour or corn meal in the 
oven; if it browns gradually, the oven is right 
for bread; if it blackens and burns, the oven 
is too hot. This knowledge can be more readily 
acquired by the use of the thermometer or pyrom- 
eter. These meters are used in every modem 
bakeshop. The baking heat is not registered all 
alike by these meters. This is caused by differ- 
ent meters, and also by placing the meter too 
near or too far from the furnace. Too much 
heat often injures these meters and they be- 
come unreliable. A few trials with the differ- 
ent meters will soon teach the right degrees for 
baking. When a furnace oven has attained the 
proper heat, the doors and dampers are closed 
and the oven is laid off. In the usual routine 
of baking, the oven is generally heated for one 
hour, let draw, and then laid off for an hour. 
The oven is then swabbed out, and the baking 
begins. Continuous ovens do not require laying 
off. The laying off is to distribute and tone 
down the heat. After the oven is shut down, 
the meter may register 550** Fahr. It will cool 
down after awhile to 500**. This heat may be 
used for rye bread; 450** for rolls and Vienna; 
400** for pies and pastry; 300** to 200** for 
large cake, etc. Some ovens may be right for 
bread at 350**, and so on, according to the 
nearness of the furnace. Some ovens have too 
strong a bottom heat. This requires more swab- 
bing, and often 'necessitates the use of double 
pans to prevent burning the bottom of the 
goods. The baking should be so arranged, and 
the goods got ready for baking so that the 
goods which require the most heat are baked 
first, followed by the others which require less 
heat in baking. 

892.— MILK IN DOUGH MIXTUBES. 

Milk makes a very palatable and nutritious 
bread. Many bakers object to the use of milk, 
because it is apt to turn the bread sour. It is 
best to sterilize the milk: that is, to heat it to 
the boiling point, and then cool it down to the 
proper temperature for doughing. 

When using all milk, it is best to make a 
straight dough. When only a part milk is used, 
set sponge with water, and use the milk for 
doughing. Milk which is beginning to turn 
sour can be used without danger to the sponge, 
by adding one teaspoonful of baking soda to 
each gallon of milk. Sour milk if put on the 
sponge will cause it to ferment more rapidly, 
and ages the dough in a shorter time, but 
should not be used with yeast to set sponge. 
Milk breads take more color in baking, require 



PAUL RICHARDS BOOK OF BREADS, CAKS8, PASTRIES, ICES AND SWEETMEATS. 



XO3 



a lower temperature in baking, and, conse- 
quently, less proof. 

893.— THE BAKESHOP. 

Modem bakers do no guessing in tbeir work. 
They ascertain the temperature of the shop and 
flour, and give the water the proper temperature 
to obtain a dough of a certain degree of heat. 
If the shop is kept at an even temperature, by 
heating or ventilation, the doughs can be got 
ready at a certain time for baking; bread- 
making is made more certain, and better bread 
results. The appliances should be located in 
the handiest position to make work easy, and 
the materials in the right place. There are 
many labor-saving devices, which, when used, 
often save one hand in the shop and soon pay 
for themselves. A weU-construeted shop, pro- 
vided with the proper appliances and utensils, 
makes work a pleasure and assists in doing good 
work. It also tends to retain good help, and 
prevents frequent changes, which is often the 
case when the appliances are not satisfactory. 

894.--FEENCH BREADS. 

It is usage in many bakeries to make French, 
Vienna, and the ordinary pan breads all out of 
one dough, the only difference in the breads 
being in the name and shape. The fancy 
breads of Paris, the Pain du Luxe, is made 
after the Vienna method — raised with com- 
pressed yeast or stock yeast and short sponges. 
The original French bread is an all-water 
bread. The bread is not as white as the Amer- 
ican breads — more of a yellowish color. The 
body of the bread is light and moist, and of 
a slight sourish taste, but good to eat. This 
bread is raised with leaven. The leaven con- 
sists of a piece of dough, about three or four 
pounds, left from the day before; this is 
thinned up with three quarts of warm water 
and made into a soft sponge with more flour. 
This sponge is ready to drop in about two 
hours; with six more quarts of water this is 
made into the second sponge. When this is 
ripe, from twelve to twenty-four quarts of 
water is added, with the usuaJ amount of salt; 
the sponge is broken fine and worked into a 
smooth dough with more flour. One-third of 
this dough is put aside to serve as the second 
sponge for the next batch of bread. 

The other dough is given a start, is scaled 
right out of the trough, molded into loaves at 
once, put in long doth-Uned baskets, the shape 
of the loaf, and given three-quarter proof. The 
oven, which has been heated during this process, 
is swabbed out. The loaf is turned upside down 
onto the peel, given three or four slanting cuts, 
put into the oven on the hearth and baked to a 
nice brown color. 



895.— NEW YORK FRENCH BREADS. 
In New York City the French bakers make 
several kinds: the long loaves, Jocos, which are 
more than two feet long, and the split loaves, 
about eighteen inches long. Some of the bakers 
use stock yeast and ferment; others make fer- 
ment only, and stock it with compressed yeast; 
a few make straight doughs. At Delmonico's, 
the famous caterers, they use stock yeast and 
ferment ; set sponge with the ferment, and make 
dough from the sponge. Nothing else but 
water, flour and salt goes into the bread. 

896.— THE NEW YORK RECIPE. 
Set a medium sponge with one gallon fer- 
ment at 75* Fahr. This sponge will be ready 
to drop in three hours. When ready, add one 
gallon of water at the same temperature and 
six ounces of salt. Make a good dough; beat 
it well, but have it rather slack; pen up in the 
trough and let rest for one hour; scale and 
mold round into a box, and when all have been 
scaled begin to mold into long loaves. Set the 
loaves in cloth-lined boxes, dust lightly with 
flour and pinch up the cloth between. When 
proved, put onto the peel, wash with water and 
give four or five cuts, and put into the oven on 
the hearth. When baked, wash again with 
water. 

897.— FRENCH SPLIT LOAVES. 
Use the same dough as for the long loaves; 
best if a little firmer. Scale and mold in the 
box; then form in long loaves of the Vienna 
shape, and set these on the board or bench. 
When they are all molded and have proved 
slightly, dust with flour (some bakers brush 
the top of the loaves with lard), and press each 
loaf along the center with a long narrow rolling 
pin, just like the split rolls. Set the loaves 
split-side down in cloth-lined boxes, pinch up 
the cloth between, and let prove. Turn split- 
side up onto the peel, put in the oven and bake 
on the hearth (without washing), to a nice 
color. 

898.— CHICAGO FRENCH BREAD. 
Set a sponge as usual, with one gallon of 
water and two ounces of yeast at 75** Fahr. 
Use a good patent flour. When ready, add one 
gallon of water, four ounces of sugar, and six 
ounces of salt, and make a good smooth dough. 
Let come up and work over; give a little time 
to recover; then scale and proceed like for the 
New York bread. The breads may be baked 
in steam, like the Vienna, or without steam, 
washing the loaves before and after baking. 

899.— KINSLEY'S FRENCH SPLIT BREAD. 
2 gallons water, 1 gallon milk, 4 ozs. yeast, 
4 ozs. sugar, 8 ozs. salt, 8 ozs. lard. 

Set a sponge as usual with water and yeast* 



I04 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BRBAD8, CAKBt, FA8TRIS8, ICBt AMD SWRXTMBATS. 



Take the sponge as soon as it is ready; make a 
dough with the milk, sugar and salt; add the 
lard after the flour, and make a nice smooth 
dough. Work over twice, and proceed like for 
the other split loaves. (See No. 897.) 

900.--VIENNA BREADS. 
The Vienna method of breadmaking is used 
by many bakers. A strong flour of good flavor 
is used, with light short sponges, and plenty of 
good strong yeast; both sponge and dough are 
treated cool and taken young. Most all of the 
breads are hearth baked, crisp, and with a good 
crust. When the breads and rolls are molded 
and have nearly attained proof, they are set in 
a cooler place. They stiffen up, but are kept 
free from drafts. Then they are baked in 
steam. (See Ovens No. 891.) 

901.— GENUINE VIENNA BREAD. 

1 gal. water, 5 ozs. yeast, 1 gal. milk, 6 ozs. salt. 
Set a very slack sponge at 70 degrees Fahr. 

When ready, add the milk and salt at the same 
temperature, and make a medium dough. Use 
the best spring flour. Let rest for one hour and 
work down; let come up again about half, and 
work over again; let it come up again, and 
make into breads or rolls. 

902.— AMERICAN VIENNA BREAD WITH 
SPONGE. 

2 gallons water, 1 gallon milk, 4 ozs. yeast, 
6 ozs. salt, 8 ozs. sugar, 8 ozs. lard. 

Before setting the sponge, dissolve the yeast 
in the pail with one pint of water at 85 degrees 
Fahr.; add some flour to make a soft batter; 
beat up well and set aside in a warm place for 
twenty minutes. Add to this batter the rest of 
the two gallons of water at 75 degrees Fahr., 
and with more flour make a slack sponge. When 
it falls in the centre, add milk and the other 
ingredients and make a medium firm dough. 
Let the dough double in size, and work over; 
let come up, and work over again. Scale and 
mold into loaves. 

Set in cloth-lined boxes, smooth-side down ; 
pinch up the cloth between and keep well cov- 
ered during proving. Give good three-quarter 
proof, turn onto the peel by means of a thin 
board, smooth-side up, give three slanting cuts 
and bake on the hearth. 

If the oven holds steam, no washing is re- 
quired; but if baked without steam, it is cut 
and washed with water before it goes into the 
oven, and washed again with a thin cornstarch 
wash, when it is baked. 

If a thin egg-wash is used going into the 
oven, no washing is required after baking. 



903.— VIENNA BREAD. STRAIGHT 
DOUGH. 
1^ gallon water, % gallon milk, 6 ozs. salt, 12 
ozs. sugar, 12 ozs. lard, 4 ozs. compressed yeast. 
Make a dough with all the ingredients at 80 
to 85 degrees Fahr. Let rest for four hours 
and work down; let come up, and work over 
once more; let it get another start and mold 
into loaves. 

904.— VIENNA CREAM BREADS. 

Take from doughs No. 902 or No. 903. When 
ready to mold, scale into twenty-four-ounce 
loaves; mold and put in round corrugated pans 
of four inches in diameter, from ten to twelve 
inches long; give three-quarter proof, and bake 
in medium heat. 

This makes nice round slices for sandwiches, 
which require no trimming. 

905.— MILK BREAD. 

1 gallon water, 1 gallon milk, 4 ozs. yeast, 
8 ozs. sugar^ 12 ozs. lard, 5 ozs. salt. 

Make a straight dough, as usual; or set a 
sponge with the water and yeast at 75 degrees 
Fahr. When it falls in the centre make the 
dough, adding milk, sugar, salt and lard. Work 
over twice, give another start and mold into 
loaves. Set in pans with sliding cover, or set 
the loaves with the smooth side up on flat bak- 
ing pans some distance apart, and cover with 
the regular baking tins. The loaves may be cut 
crosswise or in ribs, or proved up plain, without 
cutting. Give the loaves three-quarters proof, 
and bake in medium heat. If more color is 
required, the tins may be taken off when almost 
done and the baking finished without them. 
906.— PULLMAN BREAD. 

This bread is used to a large extent on the 
dining cars, and at many depots for sandwiches. 
The Pullman pans are made in single and dou- 
ble pans, with sliding covers. The size of the 
pans ten inches long and four and one-half 
inches square. This size of pan makes a large 
square slice of bread which is especially suited 
for sandwiches. 

A good Vienna or Milk Bread dough may be 
used for this bread. The dough should be 
medium firm and go through the rollers from 
ten to twelve times before molding. 

Bakers who have no machinery, use hand- 
rollers, which are not very expensive. They can 
be fastened to the bench with clamps, and can 
be taken off after using. The rolling makes 
this bread close and fine grained. Make and 
bake like the Milk Bread No. 905. 

907.— COLUMBIA BREAD. 

2 gallons water, 6 ozs. yeast, 7 ozs. salt, 

12 ozs. sugar, 1 lb. lard. 
Set a firm sponge with two-thirds of the 
water and a strong flour. Let the sponge come

up twice and fall; take it at the second drop. 
Add the rest of the water and the other ingre- 
dients; make a firm dough (best with winter 
wheat flour). Let rest for fifteen minutes; then 
run through the rollers twenty times. Scale and 
mold at once in the usual biUcing tins; cut over 
^Ye times, let prove up moist, give three-quarter 
proof, and bake in steam in a solid heat. 

This bread became well known during the 
Columbian Exposition. The old treatment of 
the sponge bleaches the flour, and the rolling 
gives a very fine white texture and grain, but 
of little flavor. 

908.— 8N0WFLAKE BREAD. 

This bread is practically the same as the 

Columbia No. 907, and can be made from the 

recipe; only set a slack sponge, give it the 

second drop, make the dough only medium firm. 

Boll, scale, mold and bake in the same manner. 

909.— SNOWFLAKE BREAD WITH 

BUTTERMILK. 

1 gallon water, 1 gallon buttermilk, 2 ozs. yeast, 

5 ozs. sugar, 6 ozs. salt, 6 ozs. lard. 

Set a medium firm sponge with water and 

yeast. Take the sponge when ready; add milk, 

sugar, salt and lard and make a medium dough. 

Let come up, and run through the break or 

rollers twelve times. Scale and moid in the 

square box mold, or bake under cover, like the 

Milk Bread No. 905. 

910.— HOME MADE BREADS. 
These breads are made mostly by the straight- 
dough method, raised either with ferment or 
compressed yeast. Some bakers add cornmeal 
in form of mush, or boiled rice. The doughs 
are set to rise in the evening, and taken in the 
morning. Some of the modern bakers in place 
of using stock yeast and ferment, use malt ex- 
tract, potato flour boiled into starch, or add 
mashed potatoes to the doughs. This process 
keeps the bread moist and adds flavor. A home 
made bread should be dose grained and of a 
solid texture, which is best obtained by making 
a medium firm dough. Work it well, and do 
not give full proof in baking. 

911.— HOME MADE BREAD WITH FER- 

MENT. 
6 quarts of ferment, 2 quarts water or milk, 
5 ozs. salt. 
Make a straight dough with the ingredients; 
set at 75 to 80 degrees Fahr. Work the dough 
well and pen it close up in the trough ; let come 
up, and work over; let come up half, then throw 
out; scale, mold in the box and form in loaves. 
Sugar and lard may be added to this mixture. 
It may also be made into French bread or rolls. 



912.— HOME MADE BREAD WITH COM- 
PRESSED YEAST. 
2 gallons water, 2 ozs. yeast, 6 ozs. salt, 
6 ozs. sugar, 6 ozs. lard. 

Make a straight dough in the evening at 75 
degrees Fahr., using a good strong flour. This 
dough will be ready in from eight to nine hours. 
It will flatten out like a sponge when ready — 
lose its resistance. Work this dough over well 
and let come on for twenty minutes. Scale, 
mold and pan as usual. 

The same recipe may be got ready in about 
four hours with four to six ounces of yeast, at a 
warmer temperature; and it can be made to 
come slow or fast, using more or less yeast. 

913.— NEW ENGLAND BREAD WITH 

SPONGE. 

2 gallons water, 2 ozs. yeast, 6 ozs. salt, 

6 ozs. sugar, 4 ozs. lard. 

Set 8i>onge with six quarts of water at 75 
degrees Fahr. Scald twenty ounces of cornmeal 
(white) into a soft mush. When the sponge is 
ready, thin up the cornmeal with two quarts of 
water; rub it through a sieve onto the sponge; 
add sugar, salt and lard, and make a medium 
dough. Let come up, work over, scale and mold 
into loaves. Give only three-quarter proof, and 
bake in a good heat. 

914.— NEW ENGLAND BREAD, STRAIGHT 
DOUGH. 

To the recipes No. 911 or No. 912 add four 
pounds of cornmeal mush, or take twenty ounces 
of white cornmeal and make it into mush and 
add it to the dough. Treat like No. 913. 
915.— QUAKER BREAD. 

Some bakers use corn-flour dry; others., corn- 
meal mush; some add malt extracts or glucose; 
others again, sugar and lard only, in this bread. 
Malt extracts improve the flavor of the bread; 
it is used in proportion of one and one-half 
ounces to one gallon of liquid. The breads are 
mostly made with a short straight dough. 
915-A.— CHICAGO QUAKER BREAD. 

Take one pail of ferment (ten quarts) ; or, 
take one pail of water and five ounces of com- 
pressed yeast, eight ounces of sugar, or eight 
ounces of glucose, two pounds of cornmeal 
mush, six ounces of salt, and eight ounces of 
lard. 

Before doughing, dissolve the yeast in one 
pint of warm water, add the glucose and some 
flour to make a soft batter. Let this stand in 
a warm place for twenty minutes. 

[This process is to strengthen the yeast and 
to secure a lively fermentation. It may be used 
also in other doughs.] 

Add the water at 80 degrees Fahr., and make 



xo6

a smooth dough with the other ingredients. Let 
rest for four hours and work over; let rise 
again about half and make into loaves. Bake 
in double square pans, give medium proof and 
bake in good heat. 

916.— MOTHER'S BREAD. 
1 pail water, 1 lb. sugar, 1 lb. lard, 5 ozs. yeast, 
6 ozs. salt. 
Make a straight dough and bake in double- 
square loaves, like the Quaker Bread No. 915. 
Part milk may be used in this recipe. 
917.— MALT BREAD. 

Take recipe No. 916, leave out the sugar, and 
add six ounces of malt extract and one pound 
of dry corn-flour, or two pounds of commeal 
mush. Make a straight dough at 75 to 80 de- 
grees Fahr. Take the dough young; give only 
good half proof in baking, and bake in steam. 

918.— POTATO BREAD. 
^ peck potatoes, 5 quarts milk, 5 quarts water, 
4 ozs. yeast, 8 ozs. sugar, 8 ozs. salt, 8 ozs. lard. 

Set a slack si>onge with the water, yeast, and 
a strong flour. Boil, peel and mash the pota- 
toes. When the sponge is ready, thin up the 
potatoes with the milk and pass them through 
a sieve onto the sponge, add the other ingre- 
dients and make a medium firm dough. Let 
come up and work over; give a start and then 
mold in loaves. Give only medium proof, and 
bake as usual. 

This bread is also made as a hearth-baked 
bread in the following manner: When the 
dough is ready to mold, scale and mold round; 
flatten the loaves some and set in boxes dusted 
with flour, smooth side up, a little distance 
apart, so they do not touch in proving; dust 
some flour on top of the loaves, cover and give 
three-quarter proof. Bake on the hearth with- 
out washing. 

919.— ENGLISH COTTAGE BREAD. 

NEW YORK HIGH-ROUND BREAD. 
IRISH SPLIT LOAVES. 
1 gallon ferment, 1 gallon water, 6 ozs. salt, 
6 ozs. sugar, 6 ozs. lard. 

Set sponge with the ferment ; take the sponge 
when ready, add water and other ingredients 
and make a firm dough. Let come up and work 
over, scale in eight-ounce pieces and mold round 
on the bench; then mold over again and press 
two pieces together on top of each other; dust 
with flour and set two by two in long narrow 
cloth-lined boxes, pinch up the cloth between 
each two and let prove. 

The oven is lined on the sides with wood. The 
bread is put in, two loaves at one time, dose 
together in square shape. This requires prac- 



tice and dexterity. When the loaves are all in 
the oven, other pieces of wood are put in front 
of it to keep it in shape tiU baked. 

Split loaves are made from the same dough, 
named IRISH SPLIT. They are first molded 
in the shape of pan loaves; then pressed along 
the centre, like the French split; set to prove, 
split side down, between cloths. The loaves are 
baked like the Cottage loaves, ends and sides 
touching each other. 

920.— CHICAGO IRISH BREAD. 
Make a good home-made dough like No. 910 
or No. 911. Mold in one-pound loaves, the 
shape of pan loaves; set in cloth-lined boxes, 
smooth side down, two-by-two, so they touch; 
pinch up the cloth between, and let prove. To 
bake; put the loaves in the oven, two at one 
time, in one row, so they touch the other loaves 
at the ends, but not at the sides. Bake without 
washing. 

921.— GRAHAM BREAD; St&aioht Dough. 

2 gallons water, 3 ozs. yeast, 1% pint molasses, 

6 ozs. salt, 8 ozs. lard. 

Make a straight dough with the ingredients, 
rather slack ; use one-third to one-half of wheat 
flour with the graham flour. Let come up once, 
work over; scale, mold and pan. (Do not give 
much proof.) Bake in medium heat. Always 
treat the dough cool and take it young. 
922.— GRAHAM BREAD FROM SPONGE. 

Take two gallons of broken-up white bread 
sponge, with the salt in it; add one and one- 
half pints of molasses, eight ounces of lard, 
and make the dough with one part wheat flour 
and two parts of graham flour. Prove and 
bake like No. 921. 

923.— WHOLE WHEAT BREAD. 
GLUTEN BREAD. 
HEALTH BREADS. 

The Whole Wheat Breads, Entire Wheat 
Breads, and also the Gluten Breads, or Health 
Breads, as they are often called, are made and 
baked like the Graham Bread; less sweetening 
is used, and in some instances, when used for 
dietetic purposes, both sweetening and shorten- 
ing are left out altogether. The breads are 
made of water, or partly milk. 

Take one gallon of water, one gallon of milk, 
three ounces of yeast, six ounces of salt, twelve 
ounces of lard, three-quarters pint of molasses. 

Good flours of this kind require no addition 
of wheat flour, and are used straight; some of 
them are very poor, and bake better with some 
strong spring wheat flour added. Make the 
dough like for Graham Bread; treat cool, take 
the dough young and do not give much proof 
in baking. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKX8, PASTRIES, ICBS AND SWSBTMBATS.

924.— WHOLE WHEAT BBEAD WITH 

POTATOES. 

2 quarts milk, 2 quarts water, 2 ozs. yeast, 

2 ozs. salt, 8 ozs. sugar, 8 ozs. lard, 

1 lb. of boiled and mashed potatoes. 

Grate or mash the boiled potatoes. Use the 
water the potatoes are boiled in with the two 
quarts of milk to make up one gallon. With 
the yeast and other ingredients make a soft 
dough, and work smooth. Mold and bake like 
No. 923. The loaves may be washed with water 
after baking, or brushed with butter or lard. 

925.— ELECTEIC BROWN BBEAD. 
12 lbs. graham flour, 12 lbs. wheat flour, 
1 gallon milk, 1 gallon water, 

1 quart molasses, 1^ lbs. lard, 

1 oz. baking soda, 1 lb. baking powder, 

8 ozs. salt. 
Less of the baking powder may be needed, or 
the soda left out, if a strong powder is used 
and the bread is too light. Bub the lard in a 
part of the flour; sift the baking i)owder in 
the other part; mix both together; form a bay 
in the centre of the flour. Dissolve the soda 
in the milk, add salt and molasses and make a 
nice smooth dough, rather slack. Scale and pan 
at once, set in a warm prover, let come up half, 
and bake in medium heat. Brush over with 
water or lard after baking. 

926.— BOSTON BBOWN BBEAD. 

This bread is raised with yeast; also with 
soda, or with baking powder. More or less 
molasses may be used to make different qual- 
ities. Lard or shortening is not used in this 
bread. In hotels or restaurants the pudding 
steamer is used to steam it, but it can also be 
baked in a cool oven at a temperature of 200 
to 250 degrees Fahr. 

To bake: set the molds in a pan with about 
two inches of water in it, which steam-bakes the 
bread, and prevents too much browning at the 
bottom. 

Self-raising, ready-made brown bread flours 
are in the market, which have to be mixed with 
even quantities of milk or water and molasses 
into a soft batter, and steamed as usual. 

927.— BOSTON BROWN BREAD; YEAST 
RAISED. 

2 lbs. rye flour, 2 ozs. yeast, 

2 lbs. cornmeal, 1 quart molasses, 

2 lbs. graham flour, 2 ozs. salt, 

2 lbs. wheat flour. 
Make a sponge with the yeast and rye flour, 
using warm water. Scald the cornmeal with 
one quart boiling water, and let cool. When the 
sponge is ready, add molasses and salt, corn- 
meal mush and the other flours, and mix with 



milk into a smooth dough. When it shows life, 
divide into loaves and fill into well-greased 
molds. This mixture makes about one dozen 
loaves. Let rise to three-quarter proof, and 
steam or bake for three hours. 

928.— BOSTON BROWN BREAD with SODA. 
1 lb. rye flour, 1 quart molasses, 

1 lb. graham flour, 3 pints milk, 

2 lbs. cornmeal, 2 ozs. salt, 

1 lb. wheat flour, 1 oz. baking soda. 

Mix all the flours together, dissolve the soda 
in the milk; add salt and molasses, and make 
a slack dough, same as for drop cakes, adding 
more milk if required. Fill molds about three- 
quarters full. Steam or bake for three hours. 

Three ounces of baking powder may be used 
in place of the soda. 

Raisins and currants are used for variety in 
the brown breads, also a small addition of 
spices, and stale cake crumbs may be used up 
in the breads. 

929.— SALTRISING BREAD. 

This bread is made of winter wheat flour, 
not of bread flour. Take half a cupful of corn- 
meal and half a teaspoonful of soda; scald 
with three cupfuls of fresh milk, and make a 
very thin mush; add a pinch of salt and a lit- 
tle sugar. Set in a warm place over night, at an 
even temperature of 85 to 90 degrees Fahr., and 
keep well covered. In twelve hours this yeast 
will be light. Mix two quarts of warm water 
and two pounds of flour at 95 degrees Fahr., 
and add the yeast. This sponge will be ready 
in about one hour; add one more quart of 
water, two ounces of sugar and two of salt, a 
little lard, and with more flour make a medium 
flrm dough. Scale and mold into loaves, put 
in pans, give about one-half proof, and bake 
like other breads. 

A very warm temperature is required from 
the beginning to the finish, to make this bread 
successfully. 

930.— TO MAKE VARIOUS KINDS OF 
BREADS FROM ONE LARGE SPONGE. 
Set a medium sponge with four gallons of 
water, six to eight ounces of yeast, with a good 
flour, at a warm temperature of about 80 de- 
grees Fahr. This sponge will have a good 
drop in three hours. (This same sponge may 
be set at a cooler temperature and less yeast, 
for a long sponge.) One quart of liquid makes 
about five pounds of sponge dough. 

Take from the ready sponge ten pounds for 
COFFEE CAKES, or SWEET ROLLS; add 
ten eggs, one-half pint of warm milk, one and 
one-quarter pounds of sugar, one and one-half 
pounds of butter, flavor, a little salt, and make 
this with more flour into a dough. 



io3 



PAUL RICHARDS* BOOK OF BRBADS, CAKBS. PA8TRIB8. ICBS AMD SWBBTMKATS. 



Take ten pounds of sponge for OTHEB 
BOLLS; add half a pint of milk, ten ounces of 
sugar, a little salt, one pound of lard or but- 
ter; this makes another dough. 

This would leave nearly three gallons of 
sponge. To this sponge we add two gallons of 
water at a suitable temperature, also one pound 
of salt, and break up and mix the sponge 
dough and water. 

From this broken sponge we measure one 
gallon, adding to it one pint, or less, of mo- 
lasses and some lard, and make a dough with 
graham and wheat flour. 

Take one gallon of the sponge for BYE 
BBEAD; add some carrawaj seed and a piece 
of old rye dough, and make dough with rye 
flour. We may take one gallon for FBENGH 
BBEAD, adding more wheat flour for the 
dough. The remaining two gallons may be 
made into VIENNA BBEAD or PAN 
BBEADS; adding half a pound of sugar and 
one pound of lard. 

In this manner various breads can be made 
from one si)onge. The rolls, coffee cakes and 
rye bread doughs can be made ready first for 
baking, because they require a good heat; the 
other doughs can be made ready in the succes- 
sion as they should be baked. 

931.— BYE BBEADS. 

There is no more difficulty in the making of 
Bye Breads than there is in the making of 
breads made from wheat flour. All the Bye 
Breads are hearth baked. Bakers not used to 
handling rye flour often fail to turn out good 
bread, because they work it like wheat flour. 
Bye flour is a weak flour, and has not the 
strength of wheat flour; it should be treated 
cooler, given less proof, and requires a stronger 
heat in baking. 

A rye sponge should be taken young; that is, 
as soon as it flattens it is ready, when it throws 
off gas and breaks. The dough should be given 
only time to come up till it shows life; then it 
should be scaled, molded, and given only about 
half the proof that is given to wheat breads. 

If a rye dough is worked over several times, 
like the wheat flour dough, or gets too old be- 
fore molding, the bread, when baked, is dry 
and tasteless, and the loaves crack during bak- 
ing and fall in the oven. 

Bye Bread made from flours which contain 
parts of wheat flour, of course, stand more 
proof. 

Many bakers prick the Bye Bread before 
putting in the oven, with a piece of wood like 
a pencil ; others punch a hole in the centre with 
the finger; this is to prevent blistering in the 
quick heat, and also to prevent bursting out on 
the sides, which a cool young dough exposed to 
a quick heat often does. 



This method, which is mostly used in Ger- 
many, also in Austria and Bussia, and also in 
some American bakeries for Bye Breads, is 
similar to the French method of making the 
wheat bread raised with leaven or sour dough 
(see No. 894). The breads are proved in 
wicker or straw baskets the shape of the loaf, 
which are made especially for this purpose. 
The baskets are slightly dusted with flour, the 
molded loaves are put in upside down, and 
when proved are turned over on the peel, 
washed and put in the oven. I think this is 
the best way of proving Bye Bread, because it 
admits the use of a softer dough, and makes a 
lighter and moister loaf. 

Another way is to mold up the bread, either 
long or round ; set the loaves on boards, or, bet- 
ter, in boxes which are thickly dusted with a 
mixture of flour and commeal, or with flne 
bran; then they are washed during proving, 
and washed again on the peel before going into 
• the oven. 

The loaves may also be set in cloths, like the 
Vienna bread, smooth-side down; turned over 
on the peel, cut, washed, and baked in steam. 
It can be washed again after baking, and some 
bakers rub the bread over after baking with a 
cloth saturated with melted butter or lard, to 
soften the crust. 

Breads made out of all rye flour and with 
sour dough only, are almost too heavy for the 
American taste. The addition of wheat flour 
and only a small quantity of sour dough with 
compressed yeast, makes a lighter loaf, which 
finds more favor, and I think is the best way 
to make Bye Bread. 

932.— SOUB DOUGH TO STABT FBOM 
YEASTBAISED DOUGH. 

Take three pounds of yeast raised rye dough; 
dissolve it in one quart of water, add some rye 
flour and make a slack sponge. Let this stand 
till the next day, and use it for the first batch 
of rye bread dough, with some compressed 
yeast. 

Every day keep a piece of the rye dough 
hack to use for the next day's hatch. 

From this sour dough the German Bye 
Breads may be made; or it may be used added 
to a broken up wheat flour sponge, like ex- 
plained in No. 930. 

933.— BYE BBEAD, STBAIGHT DOUGH. 

Take two-thirds of rye flour and one-third of 
wheat flour, two gallons of water, two pounds 
of sour dough, one and one-half ounces of 
yeast, six ounces of salt, and some caraway 
seed. 

Dissolve yeast and sour dough in the water, 
add salt and seeds and make a firm dough (rye 
dough always softens and loses some of its

Bakers using shelf ovens without tile bot- 
toms, can set the bread on roll pans dusted with 
a mixture of flour and cornmeal, and bake it. 

934.— RYE BREAD WITH SPONGE. 

2 gallons water, 2 lbs. rye dough, 1 oz. yeast, 

6 ozs. salt, % oz. caraway seed. 

Set sponge at about 65 degrees Fahr., with 
one gallon of water, yeast and rye dough. Use 
the same proportions of flour as in No. 933. 
When the sponge is ready, add water and salt, 
and make the dough. 

There are some people who do not like cara- 
way seed; for this reason some bakers add it 
only to a part of the dough, or add it during 
the molding process. This gives a choice to the 
consumer. 

935.— HALF RYE BREAD. 

The Half Rye Bread is generally made from 
a wheat flour sponge, without adding any sour 
dough, but the flavor is improved if sour dough 
is added. 

2 gallons water, 2 ozs. yeast, ^ oz. caraway 
seed, 6 ozs. salt. 

Set sponge with one gallon of water, the 
yeast and wheat flour. When ready, add one 
gallon of water and the salt, also the caraway 
seed, and make a medium flrm dough, with one 
part wheat flour and two parts rye flour. The 
bread is molded in the shape of the Vienna 
loaves, and is given more proof than the other 
rye breads. 

936.— PUMPERNICKEL. 

The coarse rye bread known here under this 
name, is made from the unbolted rye meal. The 
stone-milled meal makes a better bread than 
the meal made by the roller process. It is 
baked on the hearth in brick-shape, set close 
together, like the cottage loaves and split 
loaves (see No. 919). In Germany it is made 
in large and small loaves. In Westphalia, the 
home of the Pumpernickel, it is made in loaves 
as large as twenty-five pounds. In other parts 
of Germany, the five- and ten-pound loaves pre- 
vail. In this country it is made in two-pound 
loaves. 

In North Germany this bread goes through 
the process of CASSELING. After it is 
molded, the loaves are washed with water and 
put on the cassel, a long piece of sheet iron, 
six feet long, eight inches wide, and one-fourth 
of an inch thick, with a wooden handle. The 
ovens are heated on the inside, the coals are 
drawn to the front and divided into two long 
heaps about two feet apart. The cassel is 



on 
finished proving. This treatment keeps the 
loaves in shape, prevents bursting, and gives 
a lighter color to the crust, and also a different 
taste to the baked loaf. This treatment is not 
practiced over here, to my knowledge, because 
it is too troublesome. Bakers generally mold 
the bread, give it about half proof, wash and 
bake it like the other rye breads, only set it 
close together in brick shape. 

To make this bread on a small scale: Take 
half a gallon of broken wheat sponge, half a 
gallon of water, one pound of sour dough, three 
ounces of salt, one-half ounce of caraway 
seed, and make a firm dough with rye meal. 
Let the dough rest till it shows life. Mold in 
two-pound loaves, set on boards, give about 
half proof, wash with water, and bake as de- 
scribed above. The loaves may also be set in a 
baking pan with a wooden frame in it, and 
baked in this manner. 

937.— FRENCH ROLLS. 
FLUTES. 

This roll is used largely as a dinner roll. It 
is made in the shape of a small French loaf, 
and weighs about three ounces. The roll is 
made long with pointed ends, given several 
cuts, and baked on the hearth and in steam. 

Take from the French bread doughs No. 896 
or No. 898; break up in small pieces and mold 
round on the board; give some proof and mold 
in long shape. Set in cloth-lined boxes, in rows, 
the smooth side down, pinch up the cloth be- 
tween, and^ let prove. Then turn onto the peel 
smooth-side up, cut, and bake in steam. 

The rolls may be baked without steam, and 
set on pans dusted with cornmeal and flour, cut 
and washed before and after baking. 

938.— FRENCH SPLIT ROLLS. 
Use the same dough as for Flutes; or use No. 
899, which makes a roll with a shorter crust. 
Divide in two-ounce pieces (for hotel use they 
may be made smaller), mold round on the 
board, give some proof, and brush over with 
melted lard; then with a small rolling pin 
press along the centre, turn over and set on 
cloths, split-side down. Give good proof, turn 
over onto the peel, split-side up, and bake on 
the hearth. 

939.— FRENCH BRIOCHE. 

1 pint milk, 2 ozs. yeast, 8 to 12 eggs, 1 oz. 

sugar, 1 lb. butter (from which the salt has 

been washed), a pinch of salt. 

Set a warm sponge with the milk and yeast; 

use a strong flour. When this sponge is ready, 



FAUL RICBAKDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKBS, FA8TUU, ICB8 AND SWSKTMKATt.

add eggs, sugar and salt and work in the flour ; 
then add the butter and make a smooth dough. 
Let rise, and work over several times; then set 
in a cool place to stiffen up. After it has 
cooled and become firmer, it is ready to be 
molded in different shapes. 

The regular Brioches are molded in the shape 
of the cottage loaf, a large flat round bottom 
and a small top. In this shape it is proved and 
given some straight cuts all around the sides. 

Many other fancy shapes are made from this 
dough: small fingers, twists, crescents, etc., etc. 
These rolls are baked on pans, and washed with 
egg-wash before baking. 

940.— VIENNA EOLL. 
KAISERSEMMEL. 
EMPEROR'S ROLL. 

The best known Vienna Rolls are the Kaiser- 
semmel, or Emperor's Roll, and the Eipfl, or 
Crescent. Many other varieties are made, as 
Twists, Split Rolls, etc., etc. At Vienna sev- 
eral qualities are made: Water Rolls, Milk 
Rolls, and rolls which contain shortening. Most 
all the rolls are baked on the hearth. Only the 
rolls with shortening are baked on pans. The 
baking on the hearth and in steam, and the 
cool treatments, is what gives these rolls the 
excellent taste which has made them famous the 
world over. 

The makinff of the rolls requires long prac- 
tise, and if baked and made right cannot be 
excelled by any other breads. In the American 
mixtures sugar and lard is used, like in the 
Vienna breads, and the bread mixtures from 
No. 903 to No. 905 may be used for rolls with 
a firmer dough. 

941.— VIENNA MILK ROLLS. 

1 gallon water, 1 gallon milk, 5 ozs. salt, 

from 4 to 6 ozs. compressed yeast. 
Set a sponge with water and yeast as usual. 
When it falls in the centre, add the milk and 
salt and make a medium dough with a good 
spring flour. Let come up well the first time; 
work over and let come again; then break up 
in pieces and make into rolls. More milk may 
be used in this mixture, and also a larger 
amount of yeast. This dough is best suited 
for all kinds of Vienna rolls. 

942.— VIENNA ROLLS with SHORTENING. 
Add to the dough above (best if it is made 
from all milk), after all the flour is worked in, 
one pound and four ounces of butter. The 
butter should be melted, drawn off and set in 
a cold place to harden. If added to the cool 
dough, the rolls have a nice leafy crust when 
baked. 

943.— AMERICAN VIENNA ROLLS, 
STRAIGHT DOUGH. 

2 quarts milk, 2 quarts water, 4 ozs. yeast, 
4 ozs. sugar, 12 ozs. lard, 3 ozs. salt. 

Make a medium firm dough with the ingre- 



dients. Let the dough come up and work over 
twice; then it is ready to form into rolls. The 
rolls are baked on pans, and can be baked with- 
out steam, if an egg-wash is applied before 
baking. 

944.— VIENNA BRIOCHES. 

The Vienna Brioches are not made as rich as 
the French kind, but make a nice roll. It is 
made in many fancy shapes, like twists, snails, 
knots, small crescents, etc A small round roll 
is made with sultana raisins. The rolls are 
baked on pans, and washed with eggs before 
baking. 

Take one pint of milk, two ounces of yeast, 
one ounce of sugar, a pinch of salt, eight 
ounces of butter, and four eggs. 

Make a light sponge with milk and yeast. 
When ready, add the beaten eggs, sugar and 
salt; add the flour, and last, the butter. Make 
a medium dough, let come up and work over, 
and set in a cool place for one hour to get firm. 
Then it is ready to form the different shapes. 
Give good proof and bake to a nice golden 
color. 

945.— HAMBURG RUNDSTUCK. 
GERMAN BRODCHEN. 
HAMBURG ROLLS. 
1 gaUon milk, 8 ozs. yeast, 2% oss. salt. 

The method used in Hamburg is to make a 
slack straight dough with the ingredients, using 
a good patent flour. Set to raise in a warm 
place for half an hour; then throw out on the 
table, dust well with flour and work over in 
small pieces of not more than one pound, and 
put back in box or bowl to prove. The dough 
should be worked over in this manner from 
four to five times every half hour. In a warm 
place, this dough should then be full of life and 
ready to mold into rolls. 

Break in two ounce pieces, mold in long ovals 
and set in dusted boxes or on floured cloths; 
let prove. Then set on the peel, give a deep cut 
across, and bake on the hearth and in steam. 

Another way of making these rolls is to use a 
slack Vienna dough. Mold the rolls in ovals 
and set on pans dusted with flour and commeal, 
set to prove in a moist prover ; give half proof, 
cut across, and set back to finish proving, and 
bake in steam. 

If baked without steam, they should be 
washed with water before baking, and with a 
thin cornstarch wash when done. 

946.— GERMAN WATER ROLL. 
(SEMMEL.) 
These rolls are made from sponge dough, and 
any of the doughs used for the French or 
Vienna breads may be used. Take from the 
dough and break in one ounce pieces, mold 
round and set on board to give a little proof; 
take two pieces axtdt press lightly together, set

947.— GERMAN BUTTER ROLL. 
SPLIT BOLL. 
6 quarts milk, 6 ozs. yeast, 4 ozs. sugar, 4 ozs. 
salt, 3 lbs. butter and lard. 

Set a very soft sponge with half of the liquid 
and yeast. When the sponge is ready, add the 
salt, sugar and flour, and, last, the lard. Work 
the dough well and let rest for one hour; work 
over twice and mold round in two-ounce pieces; 
set in cloth-lined boxes and mold like the Ham- 
burg roll (No. 945). When ready for the oven, 
in place of cutting across, cut lengthwise, not 
very deep, and bake in steam. 

The same mixture is made into split rolls, 
like the French split roll (see No. 938), and 
baked in the same manner. 

948.— AMERICAN ROLLS. 
ALBANY ROLL. 
All the Vienna and French rolls are made by 
the American bakers, but generally richer and 
with a softer and more brittle crust. The 
American roll, which has many names, is known 
as the PARKER HOUSE ROLL, the ALBANY 
ROLL, the POCKET-BOOK ROLL, etc., and 
is made after a variety of recipes. The rolls 
can be made by the sponge method, or with a 
straight dough. 

949.— PARKER HOUSE ROLL. No. 1. 
2 quarts milk, 2 quarts water, 3 ozs. yeast, 
1 oz. salt, 1 lb. butter, 10 ozs. sugar. 

950.— PARKER HOUSE ROLL. No. 2. 

1 gallon milk, 4 ozs. yeast, six ozs. sugar, 2 ozs. 

salt, 12 ozs. butter or lard.' 

Make both mixtures either with a sponge, 
using half the liquid in the sponge, or make a 
straight dough. When ready, mold round on 
the board and give a little proof; then take a 
small pin and roll flat in the centre; take some 
melted butter or lard and brush over : double 
both sides together and set on pans; tney may 
be set close, to touch in baking, or single. The 
rolls should not be given too much proof. In 
baking they should open and curl backwards, if 
given the right proof. If proved moist, they 
require no washing, but may be brushed with 
butter or lard when done. 

951.— POCKET-BOOK ROLLS. No. 1. 
QUICK PROCESS. 
% gallon milk, ^ gallon water, 8 ozs. yeast, 
1% ozs. salt, 1 lb. sugar, 1 lb. lard. 

Set a slack warm sponge, with water, milk 
and yeast, at 85^ Fahr., — flour and shop of the 
same temperature. At this temperature the 
sponge will be ready in one hour. Cream sugar 



952.— POCKET-BOOK ROLLS. No. 2. 
PLAIN MIXTURE. 
Take ten pounds of white sponge, eight 
ounces of sugar, eight ounces of lard, two 
ounces of salt, and one pint of milk. 

Make into a medium firm dough. Let come 
up half and work over; repeat this once more 
and mold into rolls. 

953.— BUTTER ROLLS. 

FINGER ROLLS. 

10 lbs. sponge, 1 lb. butter, 8 ozs. sugar, 

a little salt, mace and lemon flavor. 

Work the ingredients into the sponge, and 
add more flour to make a medium dough. 

For a richer mixture three or four eggs may 
be added. 

Let it come up once and work over and make 
into rolls. Break in small pieces and mold 
round, give some proof and roll long with both 
hands; then twist and double up in rope 
fashion, brush with butter and set on pans, so 
they touch lightly; let prove and bake to a nice 
color. 

The same mixture may be made in Vienna 
crescents, braided twists, snails, and other 
fancy rolls, using a good egg-wash before bak- 
ing. 

For FINGER ROLLS, add eight eggs to the 
mixture. Break in one ounce pieces, mold round 
on the board, let rest for a few minutes. Form 
into fingers about five inches long, set on pans 
so they do not touch in baking. Let prove 
about half, wash over with egg- wash; set back 
to finish proving and bake to a nice color. 

954.— NEW ORLEANS ROLLS. No. 1. 
Take from doughs Nos. 949 or 950. Break in 
two-ounce pieces and mold on the board; then 
roll with both hands into long strips and double 
into a twisted knot. Set on pans so they touch 
in baking; brush over with melted butter or 
lard so they separate nicely, give good proof 
and bake in a good heat. 

955.— NEW ORLEANS ROLLS. No. 2. 

Take one gallon of milk sponge, or set a 
sponge with one gallon of milk and yeast, as 
usual. When ready, add to the sponge one 
pound of lard, eight ounces of sugar, one-half 
pint New Orleans molasses, one and one-half 
ounces of salt, one-half ounce of ground cinna- 
mon and ginger. 

Make a medium dough, let come up and work 
over. Break in pieces, mold round and give 
some proof. Roll out long and double up in 
twists, rope fashion. Set on pans singly, give 
half proof, wash with egg-wash, finish proving, 
and bake to a nice color.

956.— COLUMBIA BOLLS. 

LONG SANDWICH BOLLS. 
FBANKFOBT BOLLS. 
1 gallon water, 2 quarts mUk, 3 ozs. yeast, 
12 ozs. lardy 12 ozs. sugar, 2^ ozs. salt. 

Set a warm sponge with water and yeast. 
When ready, add sugar, salt and milk, and mix 
in the flour; when half mixed, add the lard and 
make a smooth dough. Let come up and work 
over twice. Break out and mold in long fingers; 
set on pans so they don 't touch in baking. Let 
prove half, wash with milk, give full proof, and 
bake in a good heat. 

These rolls are also called FBANKFOBT 
BOLLS, because they are very convenient to use 
for a sandwich with the frankfort sausage. 
The rolls are made a little longer than the well- 
known sausage. They were sold in very large 
quantities during the Columbian Exposition, 
hence the name. The rolls may be made from 
any cheap roll dough, but should be proved 
light and have a soft crust. 

957.— SANDWICH BOLLS, PLAIN. 
1 gallon water, 2 ozs. yeast, 10 ozs. sugar, 1 lb. 
lard, 2 ozs. salt. 
Make a straight dough with the ingredients. 
Let come up and work over twice. Mold round 
and set on pans single. Give good proof, and 
bake in about 450® Fahr., so they have a soft 
crust. 

958.— GBAHAM BOLLS. 
Use the Graham bread dough No. 921 or No. 
922. Mold in round or oval shape, set on pans, 
give medium proof, and bake in a good heat. 

959.— GBAHAM GEMS. 

Take from mixture No. 925. Mold round and 
set in gem or small muffin pans. Set in a warm 
prover to come up half, and bake in a good 
heat. 

Or take the following mixture : Three pounds 
of graham flour, one pound of wheat flour, 
three ounces of baking powder, two ounces of 
lard, three ounces of molasses, one-half ounce 
of salt. Sift the baking powder in the flour, 
make a bay in the centre, add the salt and 
molasses and the melted lard, mix with milk or 
water to a slack dough. Drop at once in the 
gem pans, and bake in a good heat. 

960.— SPECIAL HOTEL BBEADS. 
Bakers in hotels are often called upon to 
make special breads for parties, banquets, etc. 
While generally the Vienna and French bread 
is used, many caterers prefer to serve a small 
individual loaf or roll to each person. This is 
an old custom brought over from Europe, 
where it has been in use for many years. The 
largest of these loaves is made in the shape 
of the Vienna loaf, or French loaf, weighs 
about seven ounces in the dough. It is made 



just long enough to fit exactly the oval silver 
tray in which it is served. The smallest loaf 
or roll is not more than two inches long, and 
weighs not quite one-half ounce. It is used 
to serve with soups, like consomme, or bouillon. 

As these breads are made to suit the fancy 
of the dinner-givers or caterers, they differ con- 
siderably in size, weight and quality. The 
small loaves like the French flute, about four 
ounces in weight, are mostly in use for a dinner 
loaf. Another is made of all milk dough, like 
the Vienna or French loaf, given several cuts. 
Another one is cut from end to end along the 
centre, which makes it look like a split loaf. 
One loaf is made round, from Vienna dough. 
It is cut across the centre before baking. 

These breads should be baked in steam and 
on the hearth, and have a good crust. They 
can also be baked on pans and without steam, 
but then should be washed with a light egg- 
wash before baking. 

A Vienna dough is considered best for these 
rolls, except where a very crisp, hard-crusted 
bread is wanted, it is preferable to use an all- 
water dough. 

For light luncheons, teas and receptions, 
where no heavy dishes are served, a light and 
rich bread is served, something like the French 
or Vienna Brioches (see Nos. 939 and 944), 
made in fancy shapes, like crescents, twists or 
fingers. 

Other breads used at dinners are SOUP 
STICKS, CHEESE STICKS, CHEESE 
STBAWS, PULLED BBEAD, etc., etc. Cater- 
ers charge twenty cents per dozen for cheese 
and soup sticks and fancy finger rolls and 
brioches, so that there is a good profit in these 
breads. 

All these small breads should be made neat 
and attractive in appearance; the soup sticks 
and cheese straws small and dainty; better 
have them rather small than too large, to be in 
accordance with the other attractions which 
pertain to a good table. 

961.— SOUP STICKS. 

Take Vienna or American Bolls dough with 
a good shortening, but very little sugar in it. 

When the dough is ready, put it in a cool 
place to stiffen and to lose some of its springi- 
ness. It is better to mold, and keeps better 
shape when cold. Break in small pieces and 
form in strips of the length and thickness of 
a lead pencil. Put on pans, prove and bake in 
a cool oven crisp and dry. 

962.— SOUP STICKS WITH BAKING 

POWDEB. 
These sticks can be made on short notice. 
Take one pound of flour, one ounce of baking 
powder, and one and one-half ounces of sugar, 
one ounce of butter, and mix with milk. Bub 
the butter in the flour, mix in the baking pow- 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKES, PASTRISS, ICBS AND SWBBTMBAT8. 



"3 



der and sugar, and mix with milk a little firmer 
than a tea biscuit mixture. Form in strips 
like the other soup sticks, brush over with milk, 
and bake crisp and dry. 

963.— CHEESE STICKS. 
(PAIN SWISS.) 

Cheese sticks are served with fancy salads, 
and also at the beginning of the dinner, after 
the soups, with the hors d'ceuvres, which con- 
sist of small patties and other appetizers. They 
are made of puff-paste in which some dry 
grated cheese is rolled in. 

For gentlemen's parties it is often served 
deviled — ^that is, a dash of cayenne pepper is 
added to the grated cheese to sharpen the ap- 
petite. 

The best cheese for this purpose is a dry 
Parmesan, but a good dry American cheese will 
answer. 

Take a piece of pufif-paste, roll out thin and 
grate some cheese over it, fold in three and roll 
out again to one-eighth of an inch of thickness; 
wash with egg-wash and grate more cheese over 
it. Cut in strips ^ve inches long and one-half 
inch wide, put on pans; let stand in a cool 
place for fifteen minutes, or longer, and bake 
nice and crisp in a medium heat. 

A good pie crust can be used, but puff-paste 
is better. 

964.— CHEESE STRAWS. 

Cheese straws are more like the soup sticks. 
They are served in the same manner as the 
cheese sticks. Take equal parts of butter, 
grated cheese and flour. Bub cheese and butter 
to a smooth paste, season with a pinch of 
cayenne pepper and some dry mustard and salt, 
add a few yolks of eggs, and mix with the 
flour and a little milk into a paste like a cookey 
dough. Set in a cold place to get firm, form in 
thin strips or straws about three and one-half 
inches long and set on pans. Bake in medium 
heat. 

The paste can also be made in thin biscuits. 
Rolled out one-quarter inch thick, cut into 
round biscuits one and one-half inches in diam- 
eter, prick with a fork, and bake to a nice 
fawn color. 

965.— PULLED BREAD. 

The original pulled bread is made by taking 
the inside out of a fresh baked loaf and pulling 
it apart by means of two forks in large flakes, 
which are toasted in the oven to a light brown 
crisp. 

A better way is to cut a fresh loaf in slices 
about one inch thick, trim off the crust and cut 
the slices in one-inch strips. Pull the strips 
slightly apart with a .fork, and brown in the 
oven. 

This toast is served with cheese at dinner, 
and it is also used for invalids. 



966.— RASP ROLL. 



(RASPEL BRODCHEN.) 

The Rasp rbll is also used as a special dinner 
roll, and in many other shapes for culinary 
purposes. 

These rolls are best if made from a good 
Vienna dough, and baked very crisp on the 
hearth. 

Grate off the dark crust evenly all around 
while the rolls are hot and just from the oven. 
Use a fine grater or a coarse rasp for this pur- 
pose. 

For a dinner roll, bake it about three ounces 
in weight, in the shape of a Vienna loaf, and 
remove the crust while hot. 

For sandwiches, make them in a small oval 
shape. 

The Rasp roll is also used in small round 
shape for a certain croustade. After the crust 
has been grated off, the top is cut from the 
roll, part of the crumbs removed, and refilled 
with a forcemeat, the top replaced and this 
roll is served with consomme, etc. 

For other use of the Rasp roll see Nos. 701 
and 702, Fritters and Croustades. 

967.— FANCY ROLLS AND BUNS. 

Where many kinds of rolls are made it is 
best to set one large sponge, from water only, 
or from milk and water mixed; and use it as 
described in No. 930. 

Many of the rolls given under the numbers 
from 937 to 958 can be made in smaller quan- 
tities after this method, by taking from the 
ready sponge and adding the other ingredients. 

For doughs which are made richer than the 
ordinary roll doughs, it is best to use more 
yeast in the sponges, and if sponge is used 
from a slow bread sponge, some yeast may be 
added dissolved in warm milk to make it come 
faster. 

Sponges are also used as half and three- 
quarter sponge; that means the liquid used in 
the sponge is one-half or three-quarters more 
than the liquid used on the dough; and often 
the sponge is used straight, without adding any 
liquid, except the eggs, butter and sugar and 
more fiour. 

A good dough should be worked well till it is 
smooth and comes off the fingers, and it should 
be given some time to rest and prove up before 
using. 

968.— SPONGE FOR BUNS AND RUSKS. 

Take one gallon of milk and water mixed and 
four ounces of yeast. Set a warm sponge, rather 
firm, at about 85 to 100 degrees Fahr., and use 
from this sponge as directed in the following 
recipes. 

A larger or smaller amount may be made as 
required, and more, or only two ounces of yeast 
may be used, but it is preferable to use plenty 
of good yeast to make the goods prove up light.

10 lbs. sponge, 20 ozs. sugar, 20 ozs. butter, 

4 eggs, salt, mace and lemon flavor. 

972.— RUSK DOUGH, No. 1. 

5 lbs. sponge, 1 lb. butter, 12 ozs. sugar, 8 

eggs, vanilla or lemon flavor. 

973.— RUSK DOUGH, No. 2. 

5 lbs. sponge, 1% lbs. butter, 8 ozs. sugar, 18 

eggs, lemon and mace flavor. 

Make into dough same as for plain buns. 

To the above mixtures currants, raisins, or 

chopped peel may be added to make the various 

kinds of fancy rolls and buns out of it. 

974.— STANDARD DOUGH. 

In bakeries where a variety of sweet doughs 
are used, it is the practise to make a large 
sponge from all milk, or half milk and water 
mixed, and make a standard dough from this 
sponge, with eggs, sugar and butter in it. The 
buns and rusks, and often the zwiebach, are 
made out of this dough; and it is made richer 
for other goods. 

975.— STANDARD DOUGH, No. 1. 

Set a warm sponge with one quart of water 
and one quart of milk mixed, and four ounces 
of yeast. When ready, add two quarts of milk, 
one and one-half pounds of sugar, one and one- 
half pounds of butter, one and one-half ounces 
of salt, ten eggs; flavor lemon and mace. 

Break up the sponge with the sugar, salt, 
eggs and milk in it; work in the flour and add 
the butter. Work the dough well; let prove up 
half and work over; let come again and use it. 

976.— STANDARD DOUGH, No. 2. 
Set sponge with two qaurts of milk and four 
ounces of yeast. When ready, add one quart of 
milk, twenty ounces of sugar, twenty ounces of 
butter, five eggs, mace and lemon flavor, and 
salt. Work and finish like No. 1. 

977.— STANDARD DOUGH, No. 3. 
Fob COFFEE CAKE. 
STOLLEN. 
GUGELHUPF. 
ZWIEBACK. 
2 quarts of milk, 4 to 6 ounces of yeast. 
Set a warm sponge with milk and yeast and 



about four pounds of flour.' When ready, add 
twelve eggs, one pound of sugar, one pound of 
butter, one-half ounce of salt, lemon or vanilla 
flavor. Work in the ingredients, let come up 
and work over, and let come up again, and work 
into COFFEE CAKE, PRETZELS, STOLLEN, 
GUGELHUPF and ZWIEBACK. 

The mixture may be made less expensive us- 
ing lard in place of butter, or using a part 
lard and less eggs. 

978.— HOT CROSS BUNS. 

Any of the standard mixtures may be used. 

Add one pound of currants to each Ave 
pounds of dough; or use half peel and half 
currants, as desired. 

The buns may be set single, or let them touch 
in baking. 

Have the dough rather slack, so they prove up 
light. Mold round, set on pans, give about half 
proof and cut with a sharp knife; or use the 
cross stamp. Wash over and sprinkle with 
sugar, or leave plain and ice after baking. 

979.— CURRANT BUNS. 

Take Bun mixtures from No. 969 to No. 971. 
Roll out in long strips about ten inches wide, 
sprinkle with currants; press the currants in 
the dough with the rolling pin, dust with sugar 
and cinnamon. Roll up from both sides to form 
a double coil; flatten the roll and cut in strips, 
set together on pans, cut side up. Give good 
proof, and bake in good heat. Wash with but- 
ter and dust with sugar and cinnamon, or ice 
while hot. 

Another way is to make them like the Hot 
Cross Buns, No. 978. Set close together, prove 
without cutting, and leave plain; or dip in 
granulated sugar before panning, and bake as 
usual. 

980— CINNAMON BUNS. 
Make like the Currant Buns No. 979. Roll 
out in one long strip; brush with butter, 
sprinkle with currants, sugar and cinnamon. 
Roll up like a jelly roll, cut in slices, set on 
pans cut side up, give good proof, and ice when 
baked. 

981.— SULTANA BUNS. 
Add to five pounds of plain bun dough one 
pound of sultana raisins. Mold in round or 
oval shapes, set single and wash with a light 
egg-wash before baking. Leave plain, or ice 
with water icing while hot. 

982.— GERMAN ALMOND BUNS. 
Add to Rusk dough No. 972, or to five pounds 
standard dough, eight ounces of chopped al- 
monds and eight ounces of currants, set single 
on pans, give half proof, wash with milk and 
egg-wash, sprinkle vnth chopped almonds and 
sugar, and bake in a medium hot oven.

983.— GEBMAN STREUSEL BUNS. 
Add some tsurrants to five pounds of standard 
dough. Break the dough in two-ounce pieces, 
mold in oval pieces, and set on pans single; 
give some proof and brush over with melted 
butter; flatten the rolls with the hand to about 
one-half inch of thickness, and sprinkle thicklj 
with'streusel; give good proof, and bake in 
medium hot ovens. 

984.— GERMAN STREUSEL, No. 1. 
1 lb. powdered sugar, 1 lb. 4 ozs. cake flour, 
from 6 to 8 ozs. butter, 2 ozs. chopped almonds, 
lemon and cinnamon extract, or ground cinna- 
mon. 

Mix all the ingredients together like for short 
paste; sprinkle with a little milk; or, better, 
use one or two yolks of eggs, for the mixture 
to hold together, so it can be rubbed between 
the hands into small globular pieces. It may 
also be rubbed through a colander or a coarse 
sieve. 

984a.— GERMAN STREUSEL, No. 2. 

1 lb. flour, 12 ozs. sugar, 6 ozs. butter, 1 egg, 

vanilla flavor, 1 drop bitter almond extract. 

985.— FLORADORA BUNS. 
Add to Bun dough No. 970, one pound of 
chopped cocoanut, eight ounces of candied 
orange peel, eight ounces of citron, and vanilla 
flavor. Set on pans in fingers, so they touch 
slightly on the sides, but not on the ends; 
prove and wash with egg-wash, sprinkle with 
shredded almonds, and bake to a nice color. 
Ice with vaniUa water icing while hot. 

986.— OPERA BUNS. 

Take mixture No. 971 or No. 972. Set on 
pans in fingers, like the Buns No. 985 ; sprinkle 
with chopped peanuts, and bake and ice in the 
same manner. 

986a.— BISMARK BUNS. 

Take plain Bun dough, or from No. 977. 
Mold up in round pieces on the bench, give 
some proof, flatten with the rolling pin or by 
hand. Place a little good fruit jam in the cen- 
tre, and pinch up the sides to enclose the jam. 
Set on pans so they touch in baking, let prove 
some and brush with melted butter; put back 
to finish proving. Bake in a good heat. 

When done, brush again with butter, and 
dust with a mixture of powdered sugar and 
cinnamon. 

987.— MARTHA WASHINGTON BUNS. 

Take from Standard dough No. 977. Roll 
out in strips about six inches wide, and not 
more than half an inch thick. Spread along 
the centre some of the Nut filling No. 115 or 



No. 116. Roll up, or fold the sides over the 
filling and form a long round strand about the 
thickness of a finger. Cut the strand in four- 
inch pieces, set on pans to touch, brush the 
sides with butter so as to separate nicely when 
baked; prove, wash with a thin egg- wash, 
sprinkle with coarse sugar, and bake to a nice 
color. 

988.— COCOANUT BUNS. 

Add to ^ve pounds of Bun dough; one pound 
of fresh grated cocoanut, and flavor vanilla. 
Mold up in small pointed loaves, set single, 
prove, and bake in a good heat. 

Take some shredded cocoanut and brown to a 
light color in the oven. 

When the buns are baked and while warm, 
ice the buns and sprinkle with some of the 
•browned cocoanut while the icing is soft. 

989.— CARAWAY BUNS. 

ANISE SEED BUNS. 
Add to some Bun dough caraway seeds or 
anise; flavor with lemon extract, or use grated 
lemon rind. Mold in round or oval pieces, set 
on pans single, let prove, wash with egg-wash, 
and bake in a good heat. 

990.— ENGLISH BATH BUNS. 

Bath buns are one of the old-time English 
buns and are made in several ways; they are 
made plain, or with fruit and peel; they are 
made in round shape; but often are dropped on 
pans in a rough way, which makes them look 
like rock cakes. They are washed with eggs 
and sprinkled with crushed pieces of loaf sugar 
before baking. 

Add to the Rusk mixture No. 972 or No. 973, 
eight ounces of finely-chopped lemon or citron 
peel (currants may also be added), and set on 
pans as indicated above, and bake in medium 
heat. 

991.— BATH BUNS, PLAIN. 

Take four pounds of flour, one pound of 
sugar, one pound of butter, four ounces of 
yeast, five eggs, three pints of milk, one pound 
of peel and currants. 

Set a slack sponge with the milk, yeast and 
three pounds of the flour. When ready, make 
a smooth dough with the rest of the flour, and 
add the other ingredients. Let prove up half, 
then drop on greased pans rather rough-shaped, 
in two-ounce pieces, single. Let prove, wash 
with a good egg-wash and sprinkle with a 
coarse granulated or crushed loaf sugar, and 
bake in medium heat.

992.— BUSK. 

Busks are made very much like the buns ; but 
they are generally made of a richer dough, 
which contains more butter and eggs, but less 
sugar. 

Fruit is not used in Busks, but caraway and 
anise seeds are added, also almonds. 

The Busks are set on pans and baked single, 
and also set close and baked in squares. Some 
bakers make them in the shape of a long Parker 
House or pocket-book roll, and cut the folded 
side with scissors or knife before proving, which 
looks pretty when baked. 

Take the French Brioche No. 939, or use 
mixtures Nos. 972 and 973, as directed. 

Busks are often used toasted like the follow- 
ing Zwieback, but should be a day old. 

993.— ZWIEBACK. 

Zwieback means twice baked, and it is made 
in a variety of shapes. A very light and porous 
dough is best suited for Zwieback. It should 
be made fresh every day, baked, and when one 
day old, toasted fresh several times during the 
day. There is as much difference in a stale and 
fresh toasted Zwieback as there is in fresh and 
stale toasted bread. The Zwieback should be 
toasted in the oven to a light brown color, but 
fully dry. 

The Busk mixtures and also the other stand- 
ard dough mixtures may be used for Zwieback. 

994.— HAMBUBG ZWIEBACK. 
Take from No. 976. Have the dough rather 
slack, mold on pans round and set single in 
one-ounce pieces, give good proof and b^e in 
medium heat. Let stand and cool over night, 
or at least six hours; cut with a sharp thin 
knife in halves, set on pans and toast dry to a 
nice brown. Set the tops and bottoms together 
when dry, and put away for use. 

995.— HAMBUBG CHILDBEN ZWIEBACK. 

These Zwieback are made without sugar, and 
are used for invalids and in the nursery. 

Take one pint of milk, one pint of water, two 
ounces of yeast, one-half ounce of salt, twelve 
ounces of butter, twelve ounces of potato-starch 
or cornstarch. 

Make a slack sponge with the mixed milk and 
vmter, add yeast imd some wheat flour. When 
ready, add the cornstarch and salt, and work in 
the butter and more flour to make a rather firm 
dough; let come up and work over; then mold 
round in one-half -ounce pieces on pans; prove 
and bake like the other Zwieback. Cut and dry 
when cooled. 

This Zwieback is used with milk as a baby 
food. 

996.— SAXON ZWIEBACK. 
Take from No. 977 or No. 971. Break out in 
one-half-ounce pieces, mold round, and then 



form in fingers about three inches long. Place 
the fingers together in rows and let prove. Give 
good proof and bake to a nice color. The day 
after baking, cut in slices and toast on pans to 
a nice brown. 

997.— VIENNA ZWIEBACK. 
Take Mixture No. 973. Mold and bake in 
long ovals or in finger shape. Cut when cold 
and toast like other Zwieback. 

998.— HUNGABIAN ZWIEBACK. 
PBESSBUBGH ZWIEBACK. 

Bake like No. 997. Form in finger shapes, 
larger on both ends than in the centre ; cool and 
cut in halves and toast dry. 

Make a meringue icing; beat five whites of 
eggs firm, stir in one pound of powdered sugar, 
and add two ounces of shredded or chopped 
almonds, and flavor vanilla. Spread this icing 
over the toasted side of the Zwieback, and set 
back in the oven to dry to a fawn color. 

A variety of other similar Zwieback is made 
round or in long shapes, which are iced with 
vanilla or cinnamon icing, like the above Zwie- 
back. 

999.— ANISE ZWIEBACK. 
The Busk mixtures with anise seed may be 
made into Zwieback in the same manner. An- 
other mixture is given in No. 374, under Anise 
Toast, which is made like a sponge cake mix- 
ture. Left-over stale pound cake may also be 
made into a nice toast to be served with wines 
or liquors. 

1000.-— COFFEE CAKES. 

Coffee cakes are made from all the mixtures 
given for buns and rusks, and also from the 
standard mixtures (see Nos. 970 to 977). The 
French savarine and Baba mixtures, also the 
Gugelhupf mixtures are used as Coffee Cake 
(see Nos. 408 to 412). 

For hotel use the most convenient shape of 
baking the flat Coffee Cakes is to use layer 
cake or pie tins. Weigh the dough about twelve 
to fourteen ounces, mould round and flatten in 
the tins; sprinkle with almonds, sugar and cin- 
namon, or streusel. Let prove and bake. These 
small cakes may be cut in slices like pies, and 
are very nice to serve in this manner. 

For bakeries they are generally baked in one 
sheet and cut in pieces, or are baked in squares 
to sell for from ten to fifteen cents. 

Other shapes of Coffee Cakes are baked in 
forms of tin, Turk's head shape; some in form 
of stoUen, and others again in form of large or 
small pretzels and rings. 

1001.— STBEUSEL COFFEE CAKE. 
STBEUSEL KUCHEN. 
Take from No. 972 or No. 973; or for less 
rich cake the mixtures Nos. 974 to 977. Boll

out four pounds of the dough the size of a bak- 
iag pan, or make small pieces and lay in pie 
tins. Wash with milk or egg-wash and sprinkle 
thickly with Streusel No. 984. Give good proof 
and bake in medium heat. When baked, brush 
with melted butter while hot, and dust with 
sugar and cinnamon. 

1002.— CINNAMON CAKE. 
Prepare like No. 1001. Koll out and wash 
with melted butter, sift over a thick layer of 
sugar and cinnamon, and bake in medium heat. 

1003.— RAISIN COFFEE CAKE. 
To ^ve pounds of dough No. 972, add two 
pounds of sultana raisins and currants mixed. 
Boll out and brush with melted butter, give 
medium proof and bake plain. When baked, 
the cake may be washed with butter and 
sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon, or iced 
with vanilla water icing. 

1004.— ALMOND COFFEE CAKE. 
Add to five pounds of dough one pound of 
chopped almonds and one ounce of bitter al- 
monds. Boll out, wash with egg-wash and 
sprinkle with chopped almonds, and bake to a 
nice color ; or ice with vanilla icing when baked, 
and sprinkle with some browned almonds while 
the icing is soft. 

1005.— GEBMAN APPLE CAKE. 

Take from any of the plain bun doughs. Boll 
out into a thin sheet and line a well-greased 
baking pan. Press up well around the sides, 
and give some proof. Take good baking ap- 
ples; peel, core and cut in thin slices; put the 
apples on the cake in even rows, give some more 
proof; sprinkle a few currants over, and some 
sugar and cinnamon, and bake. The cakes may 
be brushed with melted butter before or after 
baking, or some milk or cream sprinkled over 
before baking. 

If the apples color too much, a buttered paper 
may be placed over the fruit during baking. 

1006.— OTHEB FRUIT CAKES. 

Plums, peaches and apricots may be stoned 
and cut in halves and laid on the dough like for 
apple cake. Cherries and blueberries are picked 
over, washed and put on whole. 

Some bakers use a thin pastry cream or a 
custard, which is poured over the fruit before 
baking. 

1007.— POTATO CREAM CAKE. 
Roll out a thin bottom and line a baking sheet 
like for fruit cakes, and give some proof; then 
fill with the following mixture: Take two and 
one-half pounds of boiled potatoes; peel while 
warm and let cool, and grate the potatoes in a 
bowl. Separate eight eggs; beat the yolks and 
twelve ounces of sugar together, add gradually 
to the potatoes; then add eight ounces of sifted 



flour, six ounces of melted butter; flavor with 
cinnamon, or lemon and mace, and add one-half 
pint of milk or cream; beat the whites of eggs 
light and mix all together. Spread this cream 
over the cake evenly and bake in a good heat. 
When done, dust with powdered sugar and 
cinnamon. 

1008.— VANILLA CREAM CAKE. 

Take one quart of milk, sixteen eggs, four 
ounces of butter, twenty-four ounces of sugar, 
and four ounces of cornstarch. 

Boil milk and sugar; dissolve starch in a lit- 
tle cold milk. Add the starch to the boiling 
milk and take off the fire; stir in the butter; 
add the beaten eggs, and flavor vanilla. 

Spread this cream over a pan lined with cake 
dough like for fruit cake, sprinkle a few cur- 
rants over and bake. Dust with powdered sugar 
when done. 

1009.— GERMAN CHEESE CAKE. 

For the best kinds of Cheese Cake the Tart 
fillings No. 187 and No. 194 may be used. For 
the regular Cheese Cake use the following mix- 
tures: Take three pounds of dry cheese-curd, 
eight eggs, six ounces of butter, eight ounces 
of sugar, three ounces of flour, six ounces of 
currants, six ounces of sultana raisins, four 
ounces of chopped almonds, half a pint of 
milk, a pinch of salt, a little mace^ and the 
grated rind of one lemon. 

German bakers add saffron to Cheese Cake^ 
which gives a peculiar flavor, and also more 
color to the mixture. If used, it should be dis- 
solved in a little hot water. 

Line a pan with dough like for No. 1007, and 
prepare the mixture like No. 187 or No. 194. 
Spread evenly over the dough, and bake in 
medium heat. Sift over some powdered sugar 
and cinnamon when d6ne. 

Some bakers leave out raisins and almonds, 
and sprinkle only some currants over the cheese 
mixture before baking. 

1010.— FRENCH COFFEE CAKES. 

For richer kinds of cakes, like tea rolls, but- 
ter pretzels, snails, etc., etc., more butter is 
added to the standard mixtures. The butter is 
rolled into the dough like for puff paste, which 
gives these goods a flaky appearance when 
baked. The dough is also named VIENNA 
COFFEE CAKE DOUGH by many bakers. 

For each pound of standard dough roll in 
from two to six ounces of butter, which should 
be of the consistency of the dough. (Part lard 
may be used for cheaper goods.) 

Take five pounds of any of the standard 
doughs, and set in a cool place to stiffen up for 
one hour. Take one pound of washed out but-

ter; roll out the dough about one inch thiek 
and spread the butter over two-thirds of it in 
little pats; fold over like puff paste No. 75; 
fold in three times; let rest and give two more 
turns and the dough is readj for use. 

This kind of dough should be kept cool and 
proved cool; if set in a warm closet, or in 
steam, the butter will run out and the cakes run 
flat. 

Keep from drafts during proving, and raise 
the goods in the ordinary shop temperature of 
about 65 to 70 degrees Fahr. 

lOlL—FRENCH TEA ROLL. 
Take a piece of the prepared dough. Boll 
into a thin sheet about half an inch thick. Cut 
in strips about eight inches long and three- 
quarters of an inch wide; give each strip a 
twist, and double up and twist again, rope 
fashion. Set on pans, let prove, wash with eggs 
and bake. Ice while hot with vanilla water 
icing. 

1012.— WBEATH8. 

PBENCH COFFEE CAKES. 

Boll out and cut in long narrow strips ; braid 
three strips together, form into a ring, joining 
the ends nicely together. Set on pans, give 
good proof, wash with egg-wash and sprinkle 
over a few chopped almonds. Bake and ice 
with vanilla icing. 

These cakes are made to sell at five and ten 
cents each, and may be made larger for special 
orders. 

1013.— BUTTEB PBETZELS. 
Boll and cut in long narrow strips ; twist each 
strip and form into pretzels. Prove, bake, and 
ice like No. 1011. 

1014.— SNAILS. 

CHELSEA BUNS. 

Boll and cut the prepared dough in long nar- 
row strips. Twist each strip and coil it up like 
a watch spring. Set on pans, prove, wash and 
bake. Ice after baking. 

Another way to make the buns is to take only 
plain standard dough, roll out into a thin sheet 
about one-quarter inch thidc and twelve inches 
wide; brush the sheet over with melted butter, 
sprinkle with currants and finely chopped al- 
monds and citron; dredge with powdered sugar 
and cinnamon. Boll up the sheet like a jelly 
roll. Brush the outside of the roll with butter, 
and cut the roll in slices about half an inch 
thick; set on pans cut side up, so they touch 
slightly on the sides in baking. Let prove and 
wash with egg-wash, and ice after baking, or 
sprinkle sugar on top before baking. 

The rolls may be made of any size to suit 
prices. 



1015.— GEBMAN KBANZ KUCHEN. 
Take a piece of the prepared French dough, 
or use plain standard dough. Boll out into a 
long sheet, eighteen inches long, ten inches 
wide, one-quarter of an inch thick. Cream to- 
gether four ounces of sugar, six ounces of but- 
ter, and one egg; flavor with mace and lemon 
extract. Spread this cream over the sheet, 
sprinkle with sultana raisins, currants and 
finely-chopped citron. Boll up like jelly roll, 
set on pan and form a ring, joining the ends 
nicely. Set to prove. When half proved, cut 
the top with scissors halfway down in the cen- 
tre in zigzag. Set back to prove, and then bake 
in medium heat. When done, brush with but- 
ter and dust with sugar and cinnamon; or it 
may be iced and sprinkled with shredded and 
browned almonds after baking. 

1016.— GEBMAN STOLLEN. 
CHBISTMAS CAKE. 
Stollen is the German fruit cake for the holi- 
days, and they are made as rich as the Amer- 
ican fruit cake, but are raised with yeast. The 
German housewife gets busy about one month 
before the holidays to make these Stollen, be- 
cause if very rich they improve if a couple of 
weeks old, and become rich and mellow. 

1017.— STOLLEN, NO. 1. 
Take ^ye pounds of milk sponge, or set a 
warm milk sponge with one quart of milk and 
two ounces of yeast. Add to the sponge one 
and one-half pounds of butter, twelve ounces 
of sugar, eight eggs; flavor mace and lemon, 
and make a medium firm dough. Add one 
pound seeded Malaga raisins, one pound of sul- 
tana, eight ounces of currants, eight ounces of 
chopped almonds, with a few bitter almonds, 
eight ounces chopped citron and orange peel. 

1018.— STOLLEN, NO. 2. 
Take five pounds of dough No. 973. Add one 
pound of sultana, two pounds of currants, eight 
ounces of citron and lemon peel. 

1019.— ALMOND STOLLEN. 
Add to 973, two pounds of sweet almonds, 
three ounces of bitter almonds, eight ounces of 
finely-chopped citron. 

1020.— AMEBICAN STOLLEN. 

Take five pounds of standard dough, make it 
a little firmer than for coffee cakes; add eight 
ounces of raisins, eight ounces of currants, and 
four ounces of citron; flavor mace and lemon. 

The Stollen are made from two to five pounds 
and more. In Germany they are baked on the 
hearth. Over here (in America) they are baked 
on pans.

1021.— AMERICAN GUGELHUPF. 
BUND KUCHEN. 

Take four pounds of patent flour, one quart 
of milk, three ounces of yeast, sixteen eggs, 
twelve ounces of sugar, one and one-half pounds 
of butter, half a pound of sultana raisins, half 
a pound of currants, four ounces of citron, four 
ounces of chopped almonds; flavor mace and 
lemon. 

Set sponge with milk and two pounds of the 
flour. When ready, add the other ingredients 
and flour; let come up once. Butter the molds 
well and sprinkle with chopped almonds, fill 
half with the mixture, let raise to about three- 
quarters and bake in medium heat. 

1022.— ALMOND GUGELHUPF. 

Take five pounds of milk sponge; add one 
pound of butter, twelve ounces of sugar, fifteen 
eggs, eight ounces of chopped almonds; flavor 
mace and lemon. 

Beat all together very light, fill in well-but- 
tered molds at once, let raise and bake like 
above. 

The cakes may be dusted with sugar and cin- 
namon while warm, or buttered before adding 
the sugar. 

For other cakes of this class, see FRENCH 
BABAS and SAVARINE CAKES and others, 
Nob. 408 to 412. 

1023.— DOUGHNUTS. 

For plain Doughnuts take from Nos. 969 to 
971. The better grades may be made from the 
mixtures Nos. 972 to 977. 

The cakes are fried in hot lard. The lard 
should have the right degree of heat when the 
cakes are put in, otherwise the grease will soak 
into the cakes and make them unfit for use. 

One other point which should be watched is 
not to give full proof, or use too much baking 
powder, as the cakes would get too porous and 
soak in the grease. 

Roll out the dough into a large sheet, about 
half an inch thick, cut with the Doughnut cut- 
ter, set in cloth-lined boxes to prove ; cover, and 
give about three-quarter proof. Fry in hot 
lard. Dust with powdered sugar and cinnamon.

1026.— DOUGHNUTS WITH BAKING POW- 
DER. 

CRULLERS WITH BAKING POWDER. 

No. L Two pounds of flour, one ounce of 
baking powder, four ounces of butter, six 
ounces of sugar, eight yolks, two whole eggs, 
one gill of milk, lemon extract and mace. 

No. II. Three pounds of flour, one and one- 
half ounces of baking powder, six ounces of 
butter, eight ounces of sugar, from six to eight 
eggs, one and one-half pints of milk, flavor. 

No. III. Four pounds of flour, one pound of 
sugar, four ounces of butter, two ounces of 
baking powder, four eggs, one quart of milk, 
lemon and mace. 

Sift the baking powder into the flour; cream 
butter and sugar with the eggs, add flavor, and 
mix all together to a smooth dough. Cut with 
the doughnut cutter, or the cruller cutter, and 
twist them. Fry and finish like doughnuts. 

1027.— BUTTERMILK DOUGHNUTS. 
SOUR MILK DOUGHNUTS. 
Prepare like the other recipes without bak- 
ing powder. Add for each pint of buttermilk 
one teaspoonf ul of baking soda. 

When using sour milk it is often necessary 
to add some cream of tartar, sifted in the fiour, 
to neutralize all of the soda. 

1028.— FRENCH CRULLERS. 
Prepare the paste No. 105, and make like the 
ring fritters, see No. 693. 

. 1029.— ENGLISH MUFFINS. 

ENGLISH CRUMPETS. 
Muffins and Crumpets are very popular in 
England, where they are consumed in large 
quantities. They are made and sold in the 
muffin shops, and also peddled on the streets. 
Both are raised with yeast and baked on the 
griddle, or hot plate, like the wheat and buck- 
wheat cakes. 

The muffins are served hot, palled apart in 



Z20 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BREADS, CAKBS, PA8TRIXS, XCBS AND 8WBBTMSATS. 



halves (not cut), and spread with butter. They 
are also eaten with milk or cream. 

The English muffins should be about three 
inches in diameter and one inch thick when 
baked. 

The crumpets are about five to six inches in 
diameter, and about one-quarter of an Inch 
thick. 

In some of the American restaurants or 
lunch rooms the crumpets are baked in the 
smaller muffin rings, and are served as English 
muffins. 

Take two quarts of water, or use half milk, 
one ounce of yeast, half an ounce of salt, and 
a good bread flour. 

Make a soft dough, work it well, but make it 
slack like a sponge; set it about luke warm, 
let raise to the drop, beat it down again, and 
let come up half. 

Prepare some bread boxes and fill with sifted 
flour about three inches deep. Take a muffin 
cup, or a coffee cup of small size, and make 
half-round impressions in the flour, a little 
distance apart. Drop the dough out by hand, 
in the impressions, in two-ounce pieces, just like 
drop cake; dust over with a little flour; cover, 
and let prove to near double size. Lift care- 
fully from the flour, stretch lightly, but keep in 
shape, and place on the griddle to bake. 

Some bakers set these muffins in rings td keep 
an even shape. 

When done on one side, turn carefully over 
with cake or palette knife, and finish baking. 

The best muffins of this kind are made from 
pure milk without any water, and some muffin- 
makers make the dough just firm enough so it 
can be molded, instead of dropping out. 

A richer kind of muffin is made from two 
quarts of milk, two ounces of yeast, twelve 
ounces of sugar, twelve ounces of butter, eight 
eggs, half an ounce of salt, a little grated nut- 
meg or mace. These are called SALLY LUNN 
MUFFINS, and are baked like the English 
muffins. 

1030.— ENGLISH CBXJMPETS. 

Take two pounds of flour, one quart of milk, 
half an ounce of salt, one ounce of yeast. 

Make this into a soft batter, about blood 
warm. Let raise to the drop, beat down again 
very smooth, and let raise about half. The bat- 
ter should be of a thick flowing consistency, 
thicker than buckwheat or wheat cake batter. 
Fill the batter in a dipper with a deep spout; 
grease the griddle and the rings; place the 
rings on the griddle and fill nearly full with the 
batter, spreading it with the palette knife. 
When colored to a nice brown at the bottom, 
turn over with the ring and finish baking. 

Both muffin and crumpets can be made from 
a large water or milk sponge; taking to ^ve 



pounds of sponge, half an ounce of salt, and 
work it to the right thickness — ^firmer for 
muffins, and slacker for crumpets. 

1031.— CBUMPETS WITH BAKING 
POWDER. 

Two pounds of flour, one and one-half ounces 
of baking powder, two ounces of butter or lard, 
two ounces of sugar or molasses, half an ounce 
of salt, one quart of water and milk mixed. 

Sift the baking powder in the flour with the 
sugar and salt, add the milk gradually and beat 
into a thick batter, and add the melted butter. 
Bake like the other crumpets. 

By adding a little more flour — ^about eight to 
ten ounces — it could be made into an imitation 
of the English muffin; cutting with a large cut- 
ter, and baking it like the muffins. 

1032.— AMERICAN BUTTER CAKES. 

Butter cakes are baked like the English 
muffins, and are raised with yeast, or with bak- 
ing powder, or soda. The mixture is cut out 
like tea biscuits, set in boxes, proved, and 
baked on the griddle. They are sold in many 
restaurants and lunch rooms. 

Take four pounds of flour, three pints of but- 
termilk, half an ounce of salt, half an ounce 
of soda, two yolks of eggs, and one ounce of 
melted butter. 

Take half cake-flour and half bread-flour; 
sift with the salt and soda three times; put in 
a bowl, make a bay in the centre and add two 
pints of the milk ; work in the flour and add the 
butter and the rest of the milk. A little more 
milk may be required, according to the strength 
of the flours. Work well into a very smooth 
dough, like for a soft tea biscuit dough. Put 
on the table, flatten into a square and let rest 
for half an hour to lose its springiness; roll 
out, let rest again to loosen up; then cut with 
a large biscuit cutter. Set in cloth-lined and 
dusted boxes; let raise, well covered, to about 
one inch thick, and bake on the griddle, like the 
muffins. 

1033.— SALLY LUNN. 
2 quarts milk, 2 ozs. yeast, 12 ozs. sugar, 8 eggs, 
12 ozs. butter, ^ oz. salt, flavor mace or 
nutmeg. 

Set a warm sponge with three pints of milk. 
When ready, add the remaining pint of milk^ 
eggs, salt and sugar; add flour and the soft- 
ened butter. Make a soft dough, but work it 
well ; make it as slack as it can be handled. Let 
prove up and double in size, and work over; 
then scale in eight to ten-ounce pieces, mold 
round on the board, set in greased pie tins, or 
layer cake tins, and flatten to fill the tins; 
brush over with melted butter and let prove up 
half. Take the dough scraper and cut each cake 
in four pieces, set back to finish proving, and 
bake in a good heat. 



PAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BRXADS, CAKXS, PA8TRIS8, XCBS AND 8WXBTMBAT8. 



This mixture may be used like for Englisli 
muffins, as indicated at the bottom of No. 1029. 

1034.— SALLY LUNN MUFFINS WITH 
BAKING POWDEB. 
4 lbs. flour, 3 ozs. baking powder, 3 pints milk, 
6 ozs. sugar, 8 ozs. butter, 8 eggs, % oz. salt, 
a little mace. 
Mix like No. 1031. Bake in muffin cups, or 
in rings. Set on a baking sheet in a well- 
heated oven. 

SCOTCH SCONES. 

1035.— PLAIN SCONES WITH BUTTEK- 

MILK. 

Scones are eaten in large quantities in Eng- 
land and Scotland. The scones are made plain 
with flour, buttermilk, salt and soda, and some 
bakers add lard or butter. The fancy kinds 
are made richer; sugar and butter is added, 
also flavorings, raisins, currants and peel. Soda 
and cream of tartar and baking powders are 
used in place of buttermilk and soda. Scones 
are eaten hot like muffins, split and buttered. 
The mixing should be done quickly, before the 
soda and acid works out. 

Take three and one-half pounds of flour, one 
ounce of soda, half an ounce of salt, and four 
ounces of butter. 

Bub the butter in one part of the flour, sift 
Boda and salt in the other part; mix together 
and add about three pints, or less, of butter- 
milk to make a smooth dough ; divide in twelve- 
ounce pieces, mold round; then roll out half an 
inch thick; cut each round crosswise with the 
dough scraper in four pieces, like for Sally 
Lunn. Set on pie tins so they do not touch 
too close, prick with a fork and set in the 
proof box for about fifteen minutes, to raise. 
Wash with egg-wash and bake in a good heat. 

If no buttermilk is at hand, use sweet milk; 
leave out the soda, and sift two teaspoonfuls 
of soda and four and one-half teaspoonfuls of 
eream of tartar in the flour. Make and finish 
as directed. 

1036.— FANCY SCONES. 
Take four pounds of flour, two yolks, one 
ounce of soda, two and one-quarter ounces of 
eream of tartar, a little salt, eight ounces of 
butter, eight ounces of sugar, lemon and mace; 
add half a pound of currants, or half a pound 
of sultana raisins; or, half a pound of mixed 
peel, currants and raisins. Mix and bake like 
plain scones. 

1037.— NEW YOBK BUTTEB CAKES. 

Take one quart of milk, one pound of flour, 
eight ounces of butter, eight ounces of sugar. 

Set milk, sugar and butter on the flre and 
let come to a boil ; then stir in the sifted flour, 
like you would make a cream puff mixture ; take 
off the fire, let cool a little, and work into this 
paste five yolks and ^ve whole eggs. 



Take about two and one-half pounds of white 
yeast-raised sponge, and work this with the 
scalded paste and some more flour to a smooth 
dough. Let this dough rest and prove for half 
an hour; then roU out and cut into large bis- 
cuits, like other butter cakes. Set in cloth-lined, 
well-dusted boxes; let prove, and bake like No. 
1032. 

The same mixture may be made into butter 
biscuit, using a smaller cutter. Set on pans 
single, let prove, wash with egg-wash and leave 
plain, or dip in granulated sugar before setting 
on the pan, and bake in a medium hot oven. 

1038.— YEAST RAISED MUFFINS. 
SWEET BISCUITS. 
4 lbs. flour, 1% ozs. yeast, 3 pints milk, 8 eggs, 
8 ozs. sugar, 12 ozs. butter, a little salt, flavor 
mace. 

Prepare and raise the dough like for No. 
1033. When ready, fill into greased muffin 
rings placed on a baking sheet; fill the rings 
half with the batter, let prove up full, and 
bake ii a good heat. 

1039.— WHEAT MUFFINS. 
2 lbs. flour, lyCj ozs. baking powder, 8 ozs. but- 
ter, 5 ozs. sugar, 5 eggs, 1 quart of milk, a 
little salt and mace. 
Cream butter and sugar, sift baking powder 
in the flour, and mix like for cakes. Fill into 
rings like No. 1038, or in muffin cups, and bake 
in medium heat. 

1040.— GRAHAM MUFFINS. 
Take mixture No. 959 and bake in muffin 
cups. 

1041.— CORN MUFFINS. 

2 lbs. wheat flour, 1 lb. cornmeal, 12 ozs. sugar, 

2 ozs. baking powder, 8 ozs. butter, 8 eggs, salt, 

2% pints of milk. 

Mix like cake and fill into well-greased cups. 

Bake at once in a good heat. 

1042.— JOHNNY CAKE. 
Take the mixture No. 1041, and bake in deep 
pie tins. 

1043.— RICE MUFFINS. 
Take mixture No. 1039; add one cupful of 
boiled rice, rub through a sieve, and bake like 
other muffins. 

1044.— POPOVER MUFFINS. 

These muffins are best baked in high cups or 
large sized timbale molds. No baking powder 
is used. They puff up very high and are hol- 
low. A very thin batter is required. They may 
be baked in small quantities from the same bat- 
ter, because the muffins get tough and soft, and 
lose much of their goodness when cold. They 
are excellent when eaten hot and crisp with 
good butter. 

Take one ix)und and four ounces of flour, 
eight eggs, one pint of milk, one pint of water 
(or use one quart of skimmed milk), one tea- 



122

Bpoonful of salt. Beat eggB and milk and water 
together, add salt and the well-sifted flour; beat 
all together to a thin batter free from lumps. 
Fill the well-greased molds about half with the 
batter and bake in medium heat for thirty 
minutes. 

1045.— RYE MUFFINS. 

Take one pound of rje flour, half a pound of 
wheat flour, six ounces of white cornmeal sifted 
with one and one-half ounces of baking powder; 
add four ounces of sugar, four eggs, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt ; mix this with about one quart 
of milk, and add four ounces of melted butter. 
Bake like wheat muffins. 

1046.— GINGEB MUFFINS. 

Take twelve ounces of sugar, six ounces of 
butter or lard, one and one-half pints of milk, 
one and one-half pints of molasses, one table- 
spoonful of ginger, one tablespoonful of all- 
spice, a little salt, one teaspoonful of soda, and 
four eggs. 

Mix like ginger bread, adding flour to make 
a soft batter. Fill into well-greased cups and 
bake in medium heat. 

The Ginger Bread mixtures Nos. 298 and 299 
may also be used for muffins. 

1047.— SPICED MUFFINS. 
1% lbs. cake crumbs, 1% lbs. flour, 4 ozs. lard, 
1 lb. sugar, 1 pint molasses, 8 eggs, % oz. soda^ 

1 tablespoonful allspice and ginger, a little salt. 
Mix with milk like for cakes, not too soft. 

Fill into muffin cups, and bake in medium hot 
oven. 

1048.— EGG MUFFINS. 
1% lbs. flour, 10 eggs, 1 lb. sugar, 8 ozs. butter, 
8 teaspoonfuls baking powdei; sifted in the 
flour, % pint milk, a pinch of salt; flavor mace 
and lemon. 

Mix like for cakes, and bake in muffin cups 
in medium heat. 

1049.— TEA BISCUIT. No. 1. 

3 lbs. flour, 3 ozs. baking powder, 2 ozs. sugar, 

6 ozs. butter or lard, % oz. salt. 

1050.— TEA BISCUIT. No. 2. 

12 lbs. flour, 8 ozs. cream of tartar, 4 quarts 

milk, 3 ozs. soda, 6 ozs. salt, 2 lbs. lard. 

1051.— SOUB MILK BISCUIT. 
2% lbs. flour, 2 teaspoonfuls salt, 4 ozs. butter. 

2 small teaspoonfuls soda, 1 quart sour milk. 
Sift soda in the flour, rub the lard in one 

part of the flour, and mix all into a light 
dough. Boll out and cut into biscuits, set close 
together, wash with milk and egg-wash, and 
bake in a good heat. 

1052.— SWEET BISCUITS. 
Take four pounds of flour, one pound of but- 
ter or lard, twelve ounces of sugar, six eggs, 
flavor of vanilla or lemon, two and one-half 
ounces of baking powder, about one and one- 
half pints of milk. 



Mix like for cakes, and make in a dough like 
for other tea biscuits. Mold in round pieces 
like for rolls; set together so they touch lightly 
in baking; wash with a light egg-wash and 
bake in a good heat 

1063.— PLYMOUTH BOCK BISCUITS. 
Take mixture No. 1052. Boll out half an 
inch thick and cut with oval crimped cutter; 
set on pans single, wash with egg and put a 
strip of cut citron in the centre. Bake in 
medium hot oven. 

1054.— CUBRANT BISCXHT. 

3 lbs. flour, 2% ozs. baking powder, 10 ozs. 

sugar, 10 ozs. butter, a scant quart of milk, a 

little salt, 3 eggs, 12 ozs. currants, flavor mace 

and lemon. 

Cream butter, sugar and eggs, sift flour and 
baking powder, and mix into a soft dough; 
roll out and cut in large biscuits. Wash and 
bake as usual. 

To these sweet mixtures seeds of caraway or 
anise may be added; also raisins or chopped 
almonds, and a variety of biscuits can be made 
in this manner, and given the appropriate 
names. 

Left-over biscuits, without fruit, may be 
toasted like zwieback, and served as TOASTED 
TEA BUSK or zwieback. 

The same mixtures can be made a little firmer 
with more flour, and molded in oval or finger 
shapes, set on pans single, washed and baked 
plain, or with a sprinkling of sugar on top of 
each biscuit; or molded round, and then made 
in shape of the pocket-book roll, etc., etc. 

1055.— SOUTHERN BEATEN BISCUITS. 

Beaten Biscuits are made in many Southern 
families, and also in hotels. They are not well 
known in the Northern States, and are, in fact, 
more like a cracker than like a biscuit. The 
Maryland or Virginia biscuit is made of water 
and looks like the well-known wa^r-cracker, 
and is made of the same size. The other 
Beaten Biscuit is made with milk and of a 
smaller size. Both require a firm dough. The 
dough is beaten and folded over till it blisters. 
A large heavy dub or a big rolling pin is gen- 
erally used for this purpose. Where larger 
quantities are made, rollers are used like in 
cracker bakeries. 

1056.— MARYLAND BEATEN BISCUIT. 

Take one pound of old dough left over from 
baking, and thin this up with one pint of water, 
add one teaspoonful of salt and four ounces of 
butter or lard. 

Mix this all together with more flour into a 
firm dough. Beat with pin till smooth. Form 
in long roll and break in pieces, mold round 
and let rest on the table, well-covered with a 
moist cloth, to recover; flatten each biscuit and

set on pans, and let rest again; then press each 
one down in the center^ prick with the fork a 
couple of times and bake in a hot oven. 

1057.— SOUTHERN BEATEN BISCUIT. 

Take two pounds of flour, two ounces of lard, 
a little salt, and mix with milk to a medium 
firm dough. Beat this dough till it blisters; let 
rest well covered. Boll out to one-third of an 
inch thick; let rest and recover. Cut with a 
small cutter not more than two inches in 
diameter, put on pans, prick, and bake in 
medium heat. 

The dough should be kept moist during the 
rest, to prevent drying out; this gives the bis- 
cuits a nice color in baking. Very little flour 
should be used for dusting. 

1058.— SOUTHERN CORN BREAD. 

The Com Bread as made in the Southern 
States is not well known in the Northern parts 
of this country. I think it should be introduced 
more in lunch rooms and hotels, and would 
find a ready sale, and could be sold with profit. 
It is good only when fresh made and eaten 
while hot. It is very good to eat and every- 
body likes it. It may be kept hot for several 
hours in a moist heater, or on the stove, covered 
with a damp doth. 

Southern people think the white cornmeal the 
best, because the yeUow meal often has got a 
bitter taste. The coarse-country-ground meal 
is preferred, but the medium ground and a 
very fine ground meal called ''cream meal'' is 
also used with success. The coarse meal re- 
quires more scalding than the fine ground meal. 

No wheat flour is used in this bread; it is 
made from cornmeal only, mixed with milk or 
water, some shortening and a few eggs. It is 
raised with sour milk and soda, or sweet milk 
is used with baking powder, which is more 
liable to produce a uniform bread. 

Half of the meal used is generally scalded 
with boiling water; the other part is mixed in 
dry with milk. 

It may be baked in square cake pans, and 
baked about one and one-half inches thick. 

In families the pan is made hot in the oven 
and the batter filled in without greasing the 
pans. In hotels it is baked in the deep cus- 
tard pie tins. The tins are well greased, filled 
nearly full, and baked in a good hot oven with 
plenty of top heat. Insufficient heat causes 
the bread to crack open in baking; it should 
bake up round and smooth. 

1059.— SOUTHERN FAMILY CORN BREAD. 
4 lbs. white cornmeal, 12 ozs. lard, 8 eggs, 
2 quarts boiling water, 3 pints milk, or more; 

.^ oz. salt, 4 teaspoonf uls baking powder. 

Put the meal in the dishpan; make a bay on 



one side of the meal, add the boiling water and 
mix with about half of the meal, and add the 
salt and lard; let cool a little, then add the 
milk and eggs; mix well together and, last, add 
the baking powder. (If sour milk is used, 
leave out the baking powder, and add three 
small teaspoonf uls of soda.) 

Fill the batter, which should be very thin, 
into well-greased pie-tins, and bake as directed. 

To eat, cut in slices, split each slice and 
spread with fresh butter, and you will have a 
com bread fit for a king. 

* 1060.— SOUTHERN CORN PONE. 
DODGERS. 
PONE. 

In some parts this bread is called Pone, in 
other parts Dodgers. 

In families, a pan is set on the stove, and 
when hot the mixture is spooned out in small 
egg-shapes on the hot pan; then the pan is put 
in the oven to bake. 

In hotels a larger size is made; the mixture 
is set on greased baking pans with a basting 
spoon, single, and baked in a good hot oven. 

Mix cornmeal with cold water into a soft 
mush, adding about half an ounce of lard to 
each pound of meal, and a pinch of salt. Make 
the mixture just thick enough to keep shape, 
and bake as directed. 

1061.— HOE CAKE. 

Hoe Cake may be made from the same mix- 
ture the Dodgers are made of, with a little 
more lard and water added; but are better if 
a part of the meal is scalded. 

Take three pounds of meal, a teaspoonful of 
salt, half a pound of lard, and one pint of boil- 
ing water. Scald part of the meal and add the 
lard and salt; mix with more water or milk to 
a soft mush. Put this in spoonfuls on the hot 
griddle, fiatten with the spoon and bake like 
corn cakes. 

1062.— NEW ORLEANS CORN BREAD, 

YEAST RAISED. 

3 lbs. bread flour (spring wheat), 1 lb. white 

cornmeal, 1 oz. yeast, 2 ozs. molasses, 4 ozs. 

lard, ^ oz. salt. 

Take one pint of warm water, dissolve the 
yeast in it; add the molasses, and with a part 
of the wheat flour set a sponge. Scald the 
cornmeal with some boiling water into a soft 
mush, adding the lard and salt. When the 
sponge is ready, add about one pint of milk or 
water to the sponge and the mush. Make a 
slack dough, let raise again, work over, scale, 
mold in loaves; put into pans with a cover, or 
cover pans in baking. Give medium proof, and 
bake in moderate heat.

PAUL RICHARDS BOOK OW BRBAD8, CAKX8, PA8TRXB8, XdS AND SWUTMBAT8. 



1063.— SOUTHERN BUTTERMILK BREAD. 

2 lbs. cornineali 2 lbs. wheat flour, 6 oz. lard, 
% oz. salty 2 ozs. sugar, 4 eggs, 1 oz. soda, 

1 quart of buttermilk. 
Scald half of the meal with one pint of 
water, add sugar and lard, sift the soda in the 
wheat flour. Mix and cool down the meal with 
the buttermilk, add eggs and the other flour, 
and make up like a tea biscuit dough. Divide 
into loaves, set in pans and bake in a good heat. 

1064.— SOUTHERN FRUIT BREAD. 

Take ten pounds of white bread sponge; add 
one quart of molasses, eight ounces of lard, one 
pound of currants, eight ounces of raisins, one 
ounce of allspice, and one ounce of salt. 

Work this into the sponge with more flour; 
let rest and come up once. Scale in loaves, and 
bake in tins as usual. 

1066.— NUT BREAD. 

3 lbs. whole wheat flour, 1 lb. patent flour, 

1 lb. ground peanuts, % pt. molasses, 3 pts. 
milk, 1 oz. cream of tartar, V2 oz. soda, ^ oz. 
salt. 

Sift soda and cream of tartar in the patent 
flour, and mix with the other flour and the 
ground nuts. Mix with the milk and molasses 
into a smooth dough, mold into loaves, and 
bake in long narrow pans in a good heat. 

Other nut meats may be used, and the 
graham and whole wheat breads may be made 
into nut breads in the same manner. 

1066.— OATEN BREAD. 

2 lbs. oatmeal, 2 lbs. graham flour, 2 lbs. wheat 
flour, 1 oz. yeast, 1 quart water, 1 quart milk, 

1 cup molasses, 4 ozs. lard, 1 oz. salt. 
Set a warm sponge with yeast, water and 
wheat flour. When ready, make a dough rather 
slack with the milk and other ingredients. Let 
come up once, then mold into loaves, pan and 
give only medium proof, and bake in good heat. 

1067.— HOTEL WAFFLES. 

HOTEL GRIDDLE CAKES. 

The best kinds of Waffles and Griddle Cakes 
can be made just like the yeast-raised English 
Crumpets No. 1030, by adding the enriching 
ingredients when the sponge is ready; then 
beating the batter well together, and let raise 
again for half an hour or so. 

For waffles, the batter is made of about the 
same thickness as for crumpets; for the other 
Griddle Cakes a softer batter is required. 

For YEAST-RAISED WAFFLES add to the 
Crumpet mixture, for each pound of flour, four 
whole eggs, or six to eight yolks; four ounces 
of butter, and one ounce of sugar. Flavor of 
cinnamon, mace, lemon, or vanilla may be 
added. 



For the GRIDDLE CAKES, add to each 
pound of flour one and one-half ounces of sugar 
or syrup, from one to two ounces of butter, 
salt and two whole eggs, or yolks only. 

The waffle irons or griddle should be hot and 
well greased when the batter is filled in. 

The waffles are often dusted with sugar and 
cinnamon or vanilla sugar when baked, and are 
also served plain and eaten with honey or 
syrup, or with milk and cream like the griddle 
cakes. 

1068.— WAFFLES with BAKING POWDER. 

Take four pounds of flour, two ounces of bak- 
ing powder, four ounces of sugar, one pound 
of butter, eight yolks and six whole eggs, a lit- 
tle salt, flavor of mace or lemon. 

Sift the baking powder in the flour, beat 
eggs and sugar, add about two quarts of milk 
and mix well; beat in the melted butter, and 
bake in well-greased irons. 

1069.— CREAM WAFFLES WITH SOUR 

CREAM OR BUTTERMILK. 

2 lbs. flour sifted with % oz. of soda, 12 yolks, 

1 oz. sugar, a pinch of salt. 

If buttermilk is used, add six ounces of 

melted butter; no butter is required if cream 

is used. Mix and bake like No. 1068. 

1070.— FRENCH WAFFLES. 
2 lbs. flour, % oz. baking powder, 2 ozs. sugar, 
4 ozs. butter, 12 eggs, a little salt, 1 quart milk. 

Separate the eggs, mix like No. 1068; add 
the whites of eggs, beaten to a firm froth, the 
last thing, and mix in carefully. Bake like the 
others. 

1071.— HOLLAND WAFFLES. 
SPRING WAFFLES. 

These waffles are fried in hot lard like the 
Roman cases (see Nos. 106 and 107). The iron 
used is formed in a coil. It is heated in the 
grease, then dipped in the batter almost to the 
edge, and back again in the hot grease. When 
done, the waffle is removed from the iron by a 
slight knock, and served with sugar or cinna- 
mon. 

It is also served as a sweet entree or dessert, 
with a compote of prunes or other fruit, or with 
a rich vanilla cream sauce. 

Take one pound and eight ounces of flour, six 
ounces of sugar, one pint of milk and ten well- 
beaten eggs. 

Mix flour, sugar and milk smooth, then add 
the eggs and mix again, and use as directed. 

1071a.— ROSETTE WAFERS. 
ROSETTE WAFFLES. 
The Rossettes are similar to Spring Waffles. 
The irons are patented and sold in all depart- 
ment stores, two different shapes, with handle, 
for fifty cents. The irons are smaller than the 
spring waffle irons.

1082.— THE USE OP FRUITS IN CAKES 
AND BUNS. 
When using fruit in buns or coffee cakes, the 
fruit should be prepared the day before using. 
Raisins, currants and chopped peel are often 
used in very dry condition; they draw moisture

erable to moisten the quantity of fruit used 
for each day, the day before, with a light 
syrup; the fruit gets soft and regains the 
natural shape. In this way it is more accept- 
able in cakes and much better to eat. 

1083.— EGG-WASH AND OTHEB GLAZINGS 
FOE BEEAD, BOLLS AND BUNS. 

To give a glazing to breads and rolls after 
baking, a thin wash of cornstarch is generally 
used for breads which are not baked in steam. 
The wash is made with one and one-half ounce 
to two ounces of cornstarch and one quart of 
boiling water. Potato starch gives the best 
gloss, and can be made from raw grated pota- 
toes 

Peel and grate four medium-sized potatoes in 
one pint of water; mix well and strain through 
a sieve, the starch will settle on the bottom 
after a few minutes; add about one more pint 
of boiling water, and stir on the fire till it is 
clear and like mucilage; then it is ready for 
use. 

A wash for buns is made from gelatin or gum 
arabic, which has also to be used while the buns 
are hot. Dissolve one ounce of gum in cold 
water; when soft, pour over about three pints 
of boiling water and stir till dissolved; add a 
little alum or salt, and keep the wash in a cold 
place. 

Egg-wash may be made of different degrees 
of strength by mixing yolks of eggs with water 
or milk. 

For a rich-looking wash a little burnt sugar 
is often added, or egg color. 

The wash is applied to the goods before bak- 
ing. 

1084.— THE MANIPULATION OF BBEAD- 
MAKING EECIPES. 

At the closing of this chapter on Bread- 
Making I would like to say a few words in re- 
gard to working of the recipes. 

The difference of the flours used in all parts 



of this country make it difficult to state the 
exact quantity of flour and liquids used; and to 
Insist upon the exact amounts would eertainl/ 
invite failure, and would cause the mixtures to 
be either too slack or too firm, according to 
the strength of the flour. For this reason much 
depends on the intelligent judgment of the 
workman, to add to or decrease the amount of 
flour and liquid. 

The treatment of yeasts, sponge and doughs, 
and the use of the thermometer has been ex- 
plained in the opening of this chapter. 

Machinery is being used more and more every 
day. Most all modern bakeries use dough 
mixers, dough dividing and molding machines, 
which lighten the heavy labor in baking. 

To regain the flavor of the malt and stock 
yeasts formerly used, progressive bakers who 
use compressed yeast add malt extract, malt 
sugar, or grape sugar in baking, and use potato 
flour in starch form in place of the potato fer- 
ment, to give moisture and flavor to the bread. 

Malt extract, also grape sugar, if added to 
the sponge, acts as a stimulant and ripens the 
sponge more rapidly, but loses some of the malt 
flavor during this process; therefore, if used as 
flavor, it is preferable to add it to the dough 
where more of the flavor is retained. The 
potato flour in starch form may be used in 
sponge and dough to keep the bread moist. 

Salt is used as a flavor, and also as a check 
on fermentation; it prevents the souring of the 
dough, and should be used more freely in sum- 
mer than in winter. 

It has been demonstrated by practical bakers 
that it is best to add the lard used in baking, 
after all the flour is worked into the dough, 
which makes the dough finer of grain. The 
doughs should be well worked, and plenty of air 
beaten into it. This increases the proving qual- 
ities and gets it ready in a shorter time for the 
oven. 



THE PASTRY-ROOM IN THE HOTEL. 



The art of making bread and pastry consists 
of several distinct trades, and to be successful 
and become perfect in this art takes years of 
hard work and study. While outside of the 
hotel Breadmaking, Cakes and Pastry, Ice 
Cream Making, and also the Preserving of 
Fruit are special vocations, in the hotel they 
are combined into one business, and the work 
is often performed by one person. 

In the largest hotels the work is divided into 
several parts: a regular baker is employed for 
the bread baking, but under the supervision of 



the pastry cook, who is supposed to understand 
both branches. 

Besides the four different trades named 
above, the pastry cook must know how to pre- 
pare a variety of Hot and Cold Puddings, and 
is often asked to make Candies and prepare 
Ornamental Fancy Pieces for decorating the 
tables for special occasions. 

Baking and pastry work is more difficult to 
learn, and it requires a longer time than the 
meat cooking; and although the two branches 
of hotel work are closely affiliated to each other.

Whipped cream, sweetened, makes a nice 
sauce for decorating, and may be used for 
almost any cold pudding, and for many other 
dishes. 

A proper taste in colors and flavors, also in 
forms, is required in serving, and many a plain 
dish can be made very attractive, if this point 
is observed.

The problem of keeping the rolls in proper 
condition during the breakfast is the source of 
much trouble. Many of the appliances in use 
keep the rolls hot, but dry them to such an 
extent that they are unfit for use after they 
have been for some time in the heater. Other 
heaters have too much steam inside and the 
rolls become soggy. The best roll warmer I 
have used is a closet of galvanized sheet iron, 
with double sides and bottom, which can be set 
on the carving stand. The bottom of the heater 
has an opening to fit over the hole in the stand. 
It could be made also with steam circulating 
from pipes. The inside of the closet contains 



three perforated shelves, each large enough to 
hold one of the ordinary size roll pans. This 
leaves one shelf for muffins, and two for the 
different rolls. 

But there are many heaters like that The 
main feature of this heater was a small vent, 
which let in just enough steam to keep sufficient 
moisture to keep the rolls in the proper condi- 
tion. The door of the heater should be auto- 
matic self-closing, to keep the heat inside, be- 
cause frequent opening causes any heater to 
cool off. 

A heater like this may also be used for keep- 
ing pudding warm, if it can be set ia the right 
place. 

For a pudding heater a small gas heater, or, 
better, an electric heater, on which a pan con- 
taining water can be placed, is very handy for 
use. It can be connected with a rubber hose, 
taken off and set aside when not in use.

1085.~CANDY MAKING and MISCEL- 
LANEOUS RECIPES. 

Candy making is not practised to a great ex- 
tent in hotels. Caterers and bakers make only 
the plainer kinds, which can be made without 
expensive machinery^ as used by the practical 
candy manufacturers. But even for the plainer 
kinds of candies some tools and appliances are 
required to make them successfully; without 
those appliances, it is cheaper to buy them from 
the dealer. 

The utensils required, consist of a good sized 
Marble Slab about three inches thick, a set of 
Candy Bars to enclose the boiled sugar, a Cop- 
per Candy Kettle, a Spatula and Scraper, some 
Wire Trays, Molds, a Candy Hook, a Caramel 
Cutter, a Drop Cutter, a Funnel Dropper, and 
a small Double Kettle for dipping cream 
candies. 

In the chapter on preserving fruits, I have 
given the sugar boiling degrees by the ther- 
mometer, and also the finger test (No. 67). 

For Syrup Testing, the saccharometer is 
used; and it is also used in sugar boiling for 
testing the density of the hot syrups for crys- 
tallizing till to the soft ball, or to about 
140° Fahr. (see Beaume syrup scale No. 703). 
For higher degrees in boiling, it cannot be used 
with reliance. 

FONDANT, or Cream as confectioners term 
it, is largely used in fancy candies. It is made 
for candies in the same manner as given for 
Fondant Icing (see No. 205). The cream is 
used for dipping candies, and also for centers. 
Two creams are generally made for this pur- 
pose. The cream for dipping is made of sugar 



with a very small quantity of glucose added; or 
cream of tartar is used with pure sugar. For 
the center creams, about four ounces of glucose 
is added to each pound of sugar and is boiled 
a few degrees higher. 

To use the dipping cream, it is warmed in a 
small double kettle, something like a rice boiler, 
and stirred gently till it is soft enough to cover 
fruit or nut pastes or center creams, which are 
dipped into it on a small spoon-shaped wire. 
The creams are colored and flavored at this 
point, and should be kept at an even temper- 
ature of about 95 ** Fahr., or about blood warm. 
Over heating causes the cream to set hard and 
dry. It is convenient to make this cream in 
large batches, as it will keep for a long time, 
and store it away; then it may be used as re- 
quired. 

In boiling the sugar, particular care should 
be observed to keep the sides of the kettle free 
from the small particles of sugar which are de- 
posited there by the steam from the boiling 
sugar. This may be done by washing the sides 
occasionally with a wet sponge, and by placing 
a cover on the kettle during boiling. 

1086.— STRIPED STICK CANDY. 

Six pounds of granulated sugar, one quart of 
water, half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 
Flavor of peppermint, lemon, or any other suit- 
able flavoi*. 

Put water and sugar on a brisk fire, stir 
till dissolved, and when it comes to a boil 
add the cream of tartar; boil to the hard 
crack, or about 300* Fahr. Pour onto 
the greased marble slab, between the 
bars, fold in the edges and add the

flavor. When cool enough to handle, cut off 
about half a pound, color it red, or divide it and 
color in two or three colors; leave the colored 
parts near the oven door, or any other warm place, 
so they stay soft. Take the other part and put it 
on the hook and pull till white; take off the hook 
and make into loaf. Take the colored parts, roll 
into strips and lay it on the white part in altera 
nate cobrs Roll and pull in sticks and cut in 
« suitable pieces. 

Many varieties of stick candy may be made by 
using different flavors and colors. The same 
candy may be cut in small drops with the shears. 

X087.— HARD CANDY DROPS. 

Five pounds of sugar, one and one-half pints of 
water, two pounds of glucose, flavor. 

Mix sugar, water and glucose, stir till dissolved; 
boil to 290^ in winter ( 300^ in summer). Put on 
the greased slab, fold in the comers, and when 
cool run through the drop cutter; or roll in sticks 
and cut in small drops with the shears. 

The same mixture may be used for stick candy. 

X088.— LEMON DROPS. 
For Lemon Drops, add to No. X087 one and 
one-half ounces of powdered tartaric acid after 
the sugar is boiled and on the slab. Flavor lemon 
and fold and work in the acid. When cool, run 
through the drop cutter. 

X089.—HOARHOUND DROPS. 
HOARHOUND STICKS. 

Boil half an ounce of hoarhound leaves in half 
a pint of water for fifteen minutes; strain and add 
to No. 1087 >^efore boiling the sugar. Run the 
drops through the cutter same as for Lemon Drops 
No. 1088. 

For sticks, take off half a pound when on the 
slab, and pull till white. Stripe the clear part of 
the candy with it, and finish as directed for stick 
candy No. xo86. Cut in suitable lengths when cold. 

1090.— PLANTATION DROPS. 

Five pounds of brown sugar, two and one-half 
pounds of glucose, one and one-half pints of water, 
half a pound of butter, and one quart of molasses. 

Mix sugar, water and glucose, and stir till dis- 
solved. When boiling, add the molasses; boil to 
the soft ball, add the butter and let boil to 270*^ 
Fahr., or medium crack, and pour onto the slab. 
When cool, run through the rollers in large drops, 
and wrap in wax paper. 

1091.— MINT DROPS. 
Add to No. 1087 on the slab, half a teaspoonful 
of oil of mint and finish as usual. 

X092.— COUGH DROPS. 
Add to No. 1087, on the slab, one-quarter ounce 
of powdered charcoal, one ounce of powdered 



licorice root, ten drops of oil of mint, ten drops 
of anise oil, five drops of wintergreen, and five 
of sassafras. Work this well into the sugar and 
finish like other drops. 

1093.— STRAWBERRY DROPS. 
RASPBERRY DROPS. 
Add to No. X087, on the slab, half an ounce of 
powdered tartaric acid, color cochineal or carmine, 
and flavor and finish like other drops, using the 
strawberry roller. 

X094.— EVERTON TAFFY. 

Two pounds of brown sugar, six to eight ounces 
of fresh butter, the grated rind of one lemon, half 
a teaspoonful of ground ginger. 

Put the butter in.the kettle on the fire, and when 
melted, gradually add the sugar. Stir the mixture 
during boiling till it reaches the crack degree, or 
260^ Fahr. Pour on the slab between the bars, 
and when cool enough mark and cut in suitable 
squares. 

X095.— ALMOND TAFFY. 

Add to No. X094 when it reaches the crack, 
about four ounces of blanched, shredded and 
dried almonds, and finish like Everton Taffy No.

X096.— BUTTER TAFFY. 

Take three pounds of ganulated sugar, one and 
one-half pints of water, six ounces of butter, 
lemon flavor. 

Boil sugar and water to the soft ball, or 240^ 
Fahr. ; add the butter and boil to the crack. Pour 
on the marble slab and finish like the other taffy. 

X097.— BUTTER SCOTCH. 

Three pounds of granulated sugar, one quart of 
molasses, one pound of glucose, one pint of water, 
six ounces of butter. 

Mix sugar, water and glucose; boil to the crack, 
add butter, and boil a little longer, or to the hard 
crack 290^ Fahr. Pour on buttered slab in a thin 
sheet and cut in tablets when cool; or fill into 
drop funnel and run out in dropi on oiled pans.

Fmit jellies and jams axe mixed with gelatin or 
glucose, reduced to more firmness; and also cast 
in the starch prints, left there to dry. and then are 
dipped in sngar, or crjrstallized. 

Very diy powdered starch is put in flat boxes, 
smoothened, and the imprints are made. A drop- 
funnel or a lip pan is used for filling, and starch 
powder is sifted over when the casting is done. 
The boxes are placed in dry closets till the candies 
are dried sufficiently. The starch is brushed off, 
and they are ready for use. 

1123.— SUGAR CASTING IN MOLDS. 

Fruits, flowers and figures may be cast in molds 
of metal or plaster of paris. The molds are oiled 
while cold, and the oiling is repeated after each 
cast. For fruits, artificial stalks may be added, 
and when the casts are removed from the molds, 
they may be painted to imitate Nature. 

Take six pounds of sugar, thr^e pints of water 
and one teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Stir on 
the fire till dissolved. Wash down the sides to 
avoid graining, and boil on a good fire to the hard 
crack, or 300^ Fahr. Put the sugar in the lip pan 
or funnel and run into the molds. 

If the casting is desired hollow, allow the out- 
side crust to form, then dip the molds to let the 
sagar run out from the centre. 

1x24.— CRYSTALLIZING CANDIES AND 
FRUITS. 

The crystallization of candy, and also of candied 
fruits, is done by placing bon-bons, jelly drops, 
or fruits in clarified symp which has been boiled 
to the blow or feather degree of about 235^ Fahr. 
(Or, if the syrup scale is used, the boiling syrup 
should register about 33-34 degrees Beaum^.) In 
this state the sugar crystallizes readily, and forms 
crystals on the sides of the pan and on anything 
which is suspended in it. 

The crystallizing pans or boxes axe made in 
form of trays about ten by twelve inches square 
and three inches deep. The bon-bons are placed 
in the box in rows and are covered with the syrup. 
The pans are covered and set away to crystal- 
lize for ten to twelve hours. The pans are then 
inclined, and the syrup is drained from the pan. 
The bon-bons remain till dry, and are packed in 
wax paper. 

To prepare the syrup for this purpose, use loaf 
sugar. Dissolve eight pounds in three quarts of 
cold water, stir till dissolved, and put on the fire. 
Let boil to the blow degree, 240^ Fahr. (Or test 
with the syrup scale. ) When the boiling symp 
reaches 33 or 34 degrees Beaum^ take it off the 
hre, set the kettle in cold water, cover with a 
damp cloth and let stand till lukewarm. Do not 
disturb the syrup in any way, as it might cause it 



to form lumps. When cooled, use as directed 
above. 

Fruits to be crystallized must first go through 
the process of candying, as described in the open- 
ing chapter of fruit jellies and preserves (see 
Candied Fruits and Fruits Glaces.) The fruits 
should be perfectly dry when put in the cryntaUr 
lizing syrup. The small fruits are placed in the 
trays coveted with a wire screen to prevent rising 
in the syrup, and the syrup is poured gently over 
the fmit and set to form the crystals. When you 
test the fmit, and judge the crystals to be of the 
proper size, the symp is drained like for bon-bons, 
by inclining the trays, and the fmit is left too dry 
till no more moisture is left The fruit is then 
packed in boxes lined with wax paper. 

1125.— GUM DROPS. 

ENGLISH GUM DROPS. 

Take four pounds of sugar, two and one-half 
pounds of glucose, one pint of water, and ten 
ounces of gelatin. 

Soak the gelatin in cold water. Set sugar, 
glucose and one pint of water to boil, and boil to 
the ball degree, or 244*^ Fahr. Take off the fire, 
add flavor and color and the soaked gelatin strained 
from the water. Mix well and let stand for a few 
minates. Take off the scum which arises. Fill 
in the funnel dropper and run into starch prints. 
Let dry, and take from the starch. Moisten 
lightly with gum water, or hold in a sieve over 
steam for a moment, and roll in granulated sugar. 
The drops may now be used, or further crystal- 
lized for better goods. 

1126.— AMERICAN GUM DROPS. 

Take two pounds of sugar, two pounds of glu- 
cose, a pinch of cream of tartar, and eight ounces 
of lump starch. 

Dissolve the starch in three quarts of water. 
Let the glucose and sugar come to a boil, add the 
cream of tartar, and strain the water and starch 
on the boiling sugar. ( This process is best done 
in a jacket steam boiler, same as used in the 
pastry room. ) Boil down to a thick symp, or 
drop a little in powdered starch; it should form a 
soft elastic ball. Color and flavor, and fill into 
starch prints. Finish as directed in No. 11 25. 

1127.— LIQUOR DBfOPS. 

Five pounds of cut loaf sugar, three pints of 
water, a pinch of cream of tartar, one gill of 
maraschino or kirschwasser. 

Let sugar and water come to a boil, add the 
cream of tartar and let boil to the soft ball, or 
240^ Fahr. Remove from the fire and add the 
liquor; let boil up once more, and let cool for a 
couple of minutes. Take a lip pan or funnel and 
drop in starch prints. Let stand for about twelve

Ants are very fond of sugar and often become 
a great nuisance in the bakery. 

One of the common remedies is to set the legs 
of the tables in cans of water. 

Another remedy is to scald or bum the ants 
frequently. 

Another remedy is to soak a sponge with a thin 
syrup, which attracts the ants, then put the 
sponge in boiling water. 

Ants are fond of lard; it is said that a mixture of 
sixty grains of corrosive chloride of mercury with 
one ounce of lard is certain death to all insects. 
Some of this poisoned grease put in crevices or 
in a ring on the legs of tables will be a complete 
protection. Ants cannot cross the grease and live. 
In mixing avoid getting it on the hands, and do 
not place or leave any of the poison where it may 
result in harm. 

1174.— REMEDY FOR RED ANTS. 
Use eight ounces of aqua ammonia mixed with 
one ounce of creosote, and sprinkle it aromd 
where the ants appear. 

X175 —RYE BREAD AS A WALL PAPER 
CLEANER. 

In some hotels rye bread is used to clean ex- 
pensive wall paper. 

Bake round loaves of the bread; do not give 
much proof in baking. When the bread is baked 
and while still warm, cut each loaf in four pieces, 
crosswise, pull out the soft crumb in one piece 
and press and form into a firm cone or ball. The 
paper is rubbed with this paste. The paste is 
moist but does not stick to the paper; but cleanses 
it effectively. 

Another wall paper cleaner which has been used 
in the old Richelieu Hotel, Chicago, is known by 
the name of DR. EWELL'S WALL-PAPER 
CLEANER. 

Dissolve one tablespoonful of blue vitriol in one 
pint of boiling water; while boiling, stir in suffi- 
cient winter wheat flour to make a firm paste. 
Then mix and work into it by kneading, two 
spoonfuls of pearline, one spoonful of glycerine, 
two spoonfuls of oil of sassafras.

BREAD ECONOMIES IN THE HOTEL 



In the modem hotel of to-day, everything is 
arranged with a view to the greatest economy, 
and every detail is closely looked after to reduce 
expenses and prevent waste One of the problems 
which come before hotel men is, how to reduce 
die waste of bread. 

In large hotels this waste often amounts to two 
or three barrelfuls or bagfuls a day. It consists 
of left-over and broken rolls and muffins, dry cuts 
of French bread, and for the most part, the trim- 
mings and ends of toast bread. 

Although much of the left-over bread is utilized 
in the kitchen and help's dining room, sometimes 
it accumulates in such quantities that all of it

cannot be used, and it is sold for very little, or 
given away for chicken or horse feed. 

As I said above, the largest part consists of 
trimmings and ends of toast bread. This part of 
the waste can be cut down to almost nothing, if 
the proper kind of pans are used for baking the 
toast bread in. 

Almost all the restaurants who buy their bread 
iVom the baker are using bread which is baked in 
covered pans; and some wide-awake hotel men 
also use covered pans (known as Pullman pans ) 
to bake the toast bread in. 

But in a majority of the hotels this is not the 
case. 

in most hotels the bread used for toast is baked 
in large square pans, about 18 x 25 x 3 inches, and 
five or six two-pound loaves are baked in one pan.

top, the sides and ends contract, and a thick brown 
crust forms in baking. 

Bread toasts better when a day or two old. 
The loaves baked in the multiple pans are cut or 
often broken apart, and each loaf is cut in slices,

rAUL RICHARDS' BOOK OF BRBAOS, CAXBS, PASTRIBSp ICBS AND aWSBTMBATS. 



snitable lor toast. From each end of the loaf one 
thick slice is cnt off that goes into the waste bar- 
rel; and when the other slices are toasted they 
are trimmed sqoare, and the brown top and bot- 
tom cmst also goes in the waste barrel. 

One other drawback of bread baked like this 
is, that the crumb soon gets very dry, and in hot 
kitchens large cracks form in the center of the 
loaves, which makes it nnfit to be cat in slices. 

Nearly all of this waste disappears if the bread 
is baked under cover, or in Pullman pans. 

The pans are called Pullman Bread Pans be- 
cause the bread used on dining cars and in many 
depots is baked in these pans. 

The pans are not a novelty. I have used pans 
like these twenty- five years ago in New York City 
at the old Sinclair Hotel The proprietor. Mr. 
Ashman, had the pans made after his own design 
to prevent waste. 

The reason why these pans are not more in use, 
is (probably) because it is easier for the baker to 
use large open pans. Baking single loaves in 
closed pans makes more work in cleaning, greas- 
ing and handling the pans. But I think this is 
offset in the smaller amount he would have to 
bake. 

The size of the regular Pullman pan as used at 
depots, is ten inches long and about four and one- 
half inches square, with a sliding cover. This 
size makes a large square slice, which is especi- 
ally well suited for sandwiches. 

For hotels it would be more profitable to use 
two sizes of pans: a large size like above for club 
sandwiches and other purposes where a large slice 
is required; and a smaller size, about 3>< or 3K 
inches square, for toast. Both sizes of pans could 
be from eighteen to twenty Inches long. This size 
would reduce the waste of ends. 

The smaller size also makes a nice slice, if used 
for table bread. 

Breads like this, baked in covered pans, acquire 
a different taste. The crumb becomes moister and 
retains i ts moisture longer. Only a very thin crust 
is formed in baking, and the flavor is like that of 
Vienna bread. 

The flavor and the thin crust makes this bread 
often more acceptable to patrons who do not like 
the hard-crusted French bread; and others would 
relish it for a change. 

Although the French bread is the acknowledged 
table bread, the trend of the public inclines more 
and more to the thin soft-crusted breads, which 
are very popular in the ordinary restaurants. 

I am giving here some experiences which I had 
in some Southern resort hotels, in the hope that 
it may do some good. In one hotel we had the 
old-style pans, and were baking five two-^ound 



loaves in one pan. I talked the matter over with 
the steward about getting covered pans; then it 
was laid before the proprietor. He saw the point 
at once, and ordered several dozen of the pans 
from a Cincinnati firm. 

Before we used these pans we had from five to 
six big potato-bagfuls of dry bread left over per 
week. This was given to a farmer, who furnished 
us with sawdust for use on the kitchen floor in 
return for the bread. After we had the pans in 
use for a week, not more than half of the former 
amount of bread was left over. 

The satisfaction was all around. The pantry- 
girl who had to cut the bread said: "It cuts 
much better: does not crumble like the other did. '* 
The girl who made the toast said: *' The slices fit 
better in the toaster and it toasts better.*' And 
the waiters said: "It is much better, because we 
do not have to trim it after toasting." 

Sometimes we would run short of French bread, 
and we served some of the fresh baked loaves for 
dinner: after a while the waiters b^an to ask for 
this bread, because some of the patrons liked it 
better than the French bread. 

The buying of these pans was a very good in- 
vestment, and the cost was saved in a few months' 
time. 

As to the cost of the pans, we had two price 
lists to choose from. One firm quoted three sizes 
of pans at $3.60, $3- 75 and $4.00 per dozen, and 
one firm only one size at seventy-five cents each. 
We paid $3.75 per dozen. The pans are made of 
heavy white tin, and have been in use now for 
several years. 

V>ttiite tin possesses this peculiarity: when new 
and bright, it repels heat. For this reason, for 
the first week, it is difficult to give the proper 
color to the crust in baking; but after the bright- 
ness wears of, the pans bake as well as pans made 
of black sheet steel or Russia iron. 

OTHER CAUSES OF WASTE BREAD. 

It is the custom in many hotels to cut the bread 
before the meal starts, and each waiter carries as 
much of the cut bread to his station as he expects 
to use daring the dixmer. This method probably 
tends to quicker service; but, as is generally the 
case, the waiters carry in more than they actually 
require in order to save themselves an extra trip 
to the pantry; and, as it often happens, some of 
the expected patrons do not appear for dinner. 
The bread after standing for two hours in the 
dining room is carried back to the scrap table. 

All cut bread dries quickly; and I think it would 
be more pleasing to the patrons and more profit- 
able to hotelmen if each order of bread would be 
served freshly cut, with the other orders.

In acme kitchens more of this left-over dry 
bread is used than in others. This depends 
mainly on the chef. 

At one other large Sonthem hotel, where I was 
employed several seasons, with different chefo, 
we had a very efficient chef, who is at present one 
of the best known stewards. While this chef 
presided over the kitchen there was very little 
bread wasted. Every day the left-over bread was 
carefully looked over, the brown cmsts were trim-* 
med off each slice, and pat throngh a large bread- 
crumbing machine, run by power, and was made 
into crumbs. 

The crumbs were used for various purposes, 
but the laigest part went into pork sausage and 
fricadelles for the help. We had nearly two 
hxmdred colored help, and pork sausage was one 
of the favorite dishes. The fresh pork was 
bought in the shape of whole pigs from the farm- 
ers. This chef knew how to use it to the best 
advantage, and every particle of it was used. 
When one realizes that good ordinary pork sausage 



contains about fifty per tent of soaked bread 
crumbs or cracker meal, one would think it would 
pay to make the sausage in the hotel, instead of 
paying the butcher for stale bread. 

In comparison with other chtfa we had there 
other seasons, this chef saved m my department 
about one barrel of flour every week, and inci- 
dentally the work of making it into bread, not to 
speak of the other ingredients which go into good 
bread, besides saving money to the hotel otherwise. 

One other cause which tends to a waste of bread 
is the idea that bread is an article of little value, 
because there are very few hotel men who know 
how much each loaf of bread costs them to pro- 
duce. This idea is shared by the employes. I 
have often heard the remark, ' ' O. bread is cheap, 
the loss don't amount to much." This is especi- 
ally so where the bread is baked in the hotel. In 
places where it is bought from the baker, it is 
more closely looked after, because the value of 
each loaf is known and charged to the department 
it is used in.

For Sale by JOHN WILLY» 443 South Dearborn Street, Chicago^ Ulmois 



/ rtee%9e to many ldUr9 of inquiry tagarding culinary and 
other bookt of inttruUiwe value for fioUl and catering tradee 
that I have prepared thie catalog for the purpose of anewering 
in eoneiee manner a large number of theae requeste for informa- 
tion. The booke herein described are the onee that have secured 
recognition from fitness and service they have rendered to those 
who have consulted their pages. Taken as a vohoUt the list 
of books herewith described forms a fairly complete hotel reference 
library. 



A Selection of DUhw and the Chere 
The book that has met with the largest sale and is in most 
demand from managers, stewards and cooks is **A Selsction 
of Dishes and the CheTs Reminder/' by Ghas. Fellows. 
This book is in Test pocket form, the leaf 3M by 6H inches, 
220 pages, and is the most complete and serviceable pocket 
reference book to colinary matters that has ever been 
published. It is not a cook book, in the general sense of 
the word, bat is full of ideas and suggestions regarding bill- 
of-fare dishes. Chapters are devoted to entrees of all kinds, 
salads, soups, consommes, fish and their sauces, sauces in 
general, garnishes, fancy poUtoes, miscellaneoas recipes, 
hinU to cooks and stewards, suggestions for breakfast, 
lunch and supper dishes, chafing dish cookery, menus, and 
a pronouncing glossary of culinary terms. Hundreds of the 
dishes Ibted are given with their hill-cf-fare names only, 
as the cooks understand the basic work in preparing the 
dishes, and the sauces and garnishes are treated separately, 
with information as to their component parts. Thousands 
of men who possess a copy of this book say it is their greatest 
help. The book is printed on bond paper and bound in 
flexi ble cover. Price. $1. 

The Culinary Handbook, by Chas Fellows, is an 
elaboration of his ''Selection of Dishes and CheTs Reminder," 
and presents in concise form information regarding the 
preparation and service of nearly 4,000 different bill-of-fare 
dishes; also givesmuch information of encyclopedic nature re- 
garding foods of all kinds. Quick reference to every dish de- 
scribed is facilitated with an index of 39 columns arranged in 
alphabetical order, and croes indexed, so that no matter what 
one is looking for, all he has to do is to find the initial letter 
and luder it, in alphabetical order, for second, third and fourth 
letters, etc., the article wanted, with page on which it ia 
found. Referring, for instance, to a sauce of any particular 
kind: Find the word Sauce in the index, and under it wiU 
be found in alphabetical order 149 different sauces; and under 
Salads, 71 different kinds, exclusive of the variations in 
making. Under head of Sausage there are 45 different 
kinds described, with directions for making as well as cook- 
ing and serving. In fact, the sausage information in this 
book is more complete than in any other published. The 
book contains 190 pages, the leaf 7 by 10 inches, the paper 
a strong white paper, bound in stout cover. Price $2. 

Fellows* Menu Maker is the only book devoted to this 
branch of the catering business, and is the last of the suc- 
cessful ready reference books compiled by Chas. Fellows, 
author of **A Selection of Dishes and the Chef*s Reminder," 
and **The Culinary Handbook." In this book Mr. Fellows 
has compiled in concise form thousands of suggestions for 
daily changes on the biUs-of-fare, both American and Euro- 
pean plan, for breakfast, luncheon and dinner cards, and so 
arranged as to give popular changes from day to day to 
give acceptable variety. These changes include soups, 
fish, boildes, entrees, roasts, and specials. In their presenta- 
tion he starts with typical bills-of-fare, and the changes are 
such as might be made in these bills from day to day. Also 
he has presented a chapter entitled "Suggestions for Specials 
few the Day," in which the dishes are priced, and underlined 
with Imef information regarding their composition. Also, 
he submits several sample menus for business lunches. 



banquets, and small party dinners, and one very serviceaUe 
feature of the book is a list of the most popular dishes, as 
soups, fish, boiled meats, roasts and entrees. The book is 
supplemented with 110 pages of sample menus and bills- 
of-fare, several of them photographic reproductions, and 
representing the cards of hotels and restaurants of both first 
and second dass, lunch rooms, transportation catering 
menus, dub menus, wine list, caterer's list, and several 
illustrations of glass, china and silverwares and banquet 
scenes. The book is thoroughly indexed. It Is printed on 
a fine quality of paper, the page 7 by 10 inches,Pri oe $2. 

The Lnneh Room, by Paul Richards, is the newest of 
the culinary books and bids fair to become one of the most 
popular ever produced. In writing this book Mr. Richards 
oovered all branches of the business. In its pages can be 
found lunch room plans; illustrations of equipment; chapters 
on management, salesmanship and bookkeeping; suggestions 
for bills-of-fare; reproduction of articles from technical 
journals relating to lunch room, and about 2,000 recipes 
for lunch room dishes. It is a complete guide to making 
and marketing lunch room foods and beverages. The book 
is of particular value, not alone to those who operate lunch 
rooms, but to botelkeepers who may consider the advis- 
ability of putting in a lunch room in connection with their 
business; a departure that has become very general since 
so many country hotels are changing to modified American 
or European plan, the lunch room being the stepping stone 
to the change. The book is printed on fine quality of paper 
and strongly bound. Price $2.

Vachon*8 Economical Soups and Entreee, by Joseph 
Vachon, was written in response to a demand for a book 
that would tell how to prepare savory dishes from inexpen- 
sive materials at small cost; and, in particular, how to use 
up leftover! ; by which is meant good cooked foods not served 
at a previous meal, and which have not in any way loet their 
marketable value in the senM of deterioration of quality, 
but which can be served in hotel or restaurant in the same 
appetizing manner that leftovers are served in well-to-do 
families. Mr. Vachon was selected to write this book because 
of his reputation as an economical chef. He was for many 
years employed as chef in the Transit House in the Union 
Stock Yards, a house widely known for its good table, and tbe 
hearty, wholesome foods served there on tbe American plan 
with meals at 50 cents. In this book be has given recipes

kind suited for the average hotel. Interspersed in the book

Eggs in a Thousand Wayst Eggs are the every day, 
every meal food of the nation, and are more consumed 
thruout the world than any other food, outside of grains. 
There are a few simple ways of preparing them for the 
table when served individually as eggs, but there are a 
multitudinous number of ways of preparing and serving 
eggs in combination with other foods, and with garnish- 
ments and sauces. Adolphe Meyer, a famous chef who has 
specialized in egg cookery, has compiled a liat of 1,000 ways 
of preparing and serving eggs, and these are published in a 
book of 140 pages, vest pocket size, on bond paper, bound in

Clarenbaeh System of Hotel Aeeountlng. 

The Pattlaon Loose Leaf and Card System for Hotel 
Front Oflloe Bookkeeping. 

The only published and copyrighted books on hotel ac- 
oounting are those by Ernst Clarenbaeh and Wm. C. Pattison. 

Mr. Glarenbach's book is intended mainly for the country 
hotel of American plan, and is a rounded system of book- 
keeping for this kind of hotel, taking in the front office ao- 
connting, the steward's books and private office and in- 
ventory books, together with requisition forms, and a 
system of accounting for the bar and wine room and the 
cigar reaerve stock and cigar stand. Mr. Clarenbach's 
system is also adaptable for hotels of European plan by 
slight changes easily made. 

Mr. Pattison's book deals almost enUrdy with the front 
office accounting, and in particular for hotels of European 
plan of any size, and is virtually an exposition of the concise 
and Uioroughly practical system installed by him in the Fort 
• Pitt Hotel, of Pittsburgh, of which he is assistant manager. 
Mr. Pattison, in addition to taking care of the transient 
accounts from the cashier to the private office, systematizes 
the work of the room derk, the cashier, the mail clerk, pack- 
age derk, and auditor, and in this he has produced a reliable 
and satisfactory system that works to a charm. Both 
books contain information that many a hotel man would 
pay hundreds of dollars to possess, if he knew the methods 
there explained could be adapted to advantage to his par- 
ticular hotd. Bookkeeping is but little understood by the 
average hotdkeeper, and these books have already done a 
great missionary work in promoting systems of accounting 
and for keeping track of things. The Clarenbaeh book sdls 
for $3.00 and the Pattison book is also $3.00. 

Hospitality, by John McGovern. A series of chapters 
presenting in entertaining fashion the history of hospitality 
from the earliest records to the present time. Price $1.00. 



The Whitehead Cook Books. 

The cook book9 that have done more toward improvino the 
oooking in country hotele throughout America in the laet thirty 
yeare than all othere together are thoee written by Jeeeup White- 
head. They were jirei publiehed in eerial/orm in the column* 
of the Daily National Hotel Reporter of Chicago. Mr, White- 
head vf€u a remarkable man. In addition to being an all- 
round cook he wae a weU read man, and could exprese himeelf 
in clear\, eimple Englith better than the average college grcuiuate. 
He travisled far and wide, and got hie cooking experience under 
every poeeiUe condition to fit him for the writing of cook booke. 
He worked in hotele great and email, firet-daee and eecond-claee, 
on eteamehipe, in logging campe, in eummer hotele, for hunting 
and fiehing parties, and for explorers; and he learned cUl the 
tricke of cooking with and without the euetomary uteneile; 
and he gained an experience eo large and varied, eepedeUly in 
the line of making the beet of what w€ie to hand, that hie name 
hae been authority in the ^Mnary world ever eince he began 
to write hie booke. He made it a rule not to print any recipe 
unless he had first tried it and proved ite reliability. When he 
had so proved a recipe for any subject that recipe was filed 
av>ay to go into his book, and it got there; and the recipe in the 
book is so plain as to detail that one who ie not a cook can work 
from it and produce a satisfactory dish. 

Whitehead's Amerlean Pastry Cookt Mr. Whitehead 
was trained as a pastry cook and baker in bia younger days, 
and his first book was "The American Pastry Cook." The 
quantities of the redpes are calculated on the average 
orders of about fifty persons choosing from a bill-of-fare. 
This book also contains chapters on salads and cold meat 
dishes. In his introduction to the book Mr. Whitehead says: 
** In many of the more important matters, such as puff paste, 
bread and rolls, cakes, ices, creams, and pie mixtures, and 
in cold meat dishes, corned beef management and salads, 
the standard of one pound or quart used will be found to 
make the redpes equally useful for private families, and the 
trouble of dividing the larger quantities in other cases will 
probably be fully repaid by the simple conciseness of the 
directions, the absence of all technical jargon, and the pro- 
fessional knowledge of the art of cookery imparted in every 
page. The book is unique also in having all the articles 
directed to be made graded in regard to cost, to meet the 
requirements both of those who do cooking for pleasure and 
those who are concerned in cooking for profit.** Price $2. 
Whitehead's Hotel Meat Cookings His next book was 
"Hotd Meat Cooking,** compridng hotd and restaurant 
fish and oyster cooking; how to cut meats; and soups, entrees 
and bills-of-fare. Several thousand copies of this book 
have been printed and sold, and thousands of hotdkeepers 
and caterers acknowledge a great measure of their success 
due to the influence of this book, which teaches the careful 
handling of foods, the economical use of foods, the necessity 
of deanliness in all departments of the kitchen, and presents 
many suggestions for bill-of-fare dishes that can be made 
from leftovers and served at a profit; also suggestions for 
using up all parts of the carcass that are good for food. The 
book is interspersed with anecdotes and snappy little 
editorials scintillating with wit and wisdom. Price $2. 

Whitehead's The Steward's Handbook i Mr. White- 
head's third book was written for stewards and called "Tha 
Steward's Handbook.** For many years it was the only 
book in print that instructed in the steward's duties and 
outlined the management of the back part of the house; and 
today there is no other book that ooaipies the peculiar field 
that this one does. Several pages are devoted to iilustrationa 
of requisition blanks, market sheets, storeroom issue book, 
storeroom stock book, and sample menus and bills-of-fare. 
It tells of the head waiter's duties, of dub and party catering, 
and of catering extraordinary. Also there is a profusely il- 
lustrated chapter on napkin folding; 250 pages of the book 
are devoted to ** Whitehead's Dictionary of Dishes and 
Culinary Terms and Specialties,** and this dictionary of 
dishes is today one of the most serviceable works of reference 
for caterers in the world. Price 83. 

Whitehead's Cooking for Profit i The most prolific 
of the Whitehead cook books is his ''Cookincr for Profit.'* 
This book filled a long-felt want for the small hotel, restau- 
rant and lunch room, and the boarding house. The author, 
when writing it, put himself o the podtion of the man or 
woman who had **to count the cost" very carefuUy in all 
matters of table supply, both meat and pastry; the manage- 
ment of food on hand; also to see that nothing is wasted. 
170 pages of this book comprise a diary of the author during 



THK SOTM. MOir*m.T HJLlfllBOOK SSKIXS AHB OTHSK TBOHNICLAJL BOOKS 



eight weeks employed at a amall ■ammer hotel; and he teUa 
in language from the heart the trials and tribulationa of 
landlord and oook in providing three meals a day under ad- 
Terse oonditums; as supplies not arriving on Ume, trouble 
with the help, with boarders, adverse weather oondilions, 
and the ingenious devices adopted from necessity for storing 
and preserving meats, vegetables, fruits, and dairy fooda. 
Occasionally the pages are illumined with broad smfles, as 
when there has been a lucky haul of fish, or the social parties 
are successful, or when business is rushing and everybody 
happy. The author geu down to hard pan when heitemisea 
how meals are prepared for fourteen, or sixteen, or twenty 
cenU per capita. It is not like reading a oook book; it to 
more interesting, more like a faithful portrayal of human 
nature between the kitchen and the dining room. We have 
heard prominent stewards, as, for instance, George Fulwell 
when he was at the Bates House, in Indianapolia, say that 
he got more good out of Whitehead's Cooking for Profit than 
from any other book in his big library. Price $3.00.

Franco-Amerieaa Cookery Booki The high-class cooks 
of America have great respect for the Franco-American 
Cookery Book, by Felix Deliee, of New York. The feature

menu for every day in the year, 365 in all; the dishes for 
each menu appropriate for the season, and the recipes for 
the dishes printed in large, clear type immediately following 
each menu. Another good feature to that the dishes are 
given their English name; consequently are more under- 
standable than those of the hifalutin books that indicate a 
dish that cannot be made except under a French name. 
There are several illustrations and a complete index. The 
redpes are based on suiBcient for eight persons, and may be 
reduced or t ncreased at will. Prioe $3.50

drinks. The book also contains expositions of 
accounting systems; also an elaborate descrip-

and lunch-car sendee. Also, there is a general 
description of the big lunch room systems and 
their methods; also reports of lunch room dis- 
cussions at hotel convention meetings. 

A most interesting feature of the book 
is a description of a number of successful 
lunch rooms, showing plans, outlining the 
equipment, and, picturing interior views, in 
this way offering suggestions to copy from that 
is almost as good as a journey of thousands of 
miles to investigate.

sweeping the country has turned the atten-

a use for the room heretofore devoted to the 

There is no other book published that gives so much useful

reducing overhead expenses and delivering superior quality of 
food and drinks at small cost. 

The Lunch Room^ second edition is 238 pages, beautifully 
printed on foldwell enamel paper, and strongly bound in cloth.
