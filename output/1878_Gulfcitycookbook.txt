GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



SOUPS. 



In making good soup it is necessary to observe only a few 
points. Beef is the best meat for this purpose, but mutton 
or veal will answer. Cold water should always be used at 
first, and only in sufficient quantity to prevent burning, until 
the strength or juice of the meat is extracted. Allow one 
pound of meat to one quart of water. Three or four hours 
are required to cook soup well; generally three hours' sim- 
mering, and one hour boiling after the vegetables and sea- 
soning are put m. Thickening, such as rice, vermicelli, 
macaroni, or durnpling, should be put in last. Vegetables 
should be nicely chopped. 

OKRA SOUP. 

Take a shank-bone, or about three pounds of beef, and 
boil in three quarts of water until tender, skimming when 
necessary. Add one quart of chopped okra, one pint of pre- 
pared tomatoes, one onion cut fine, and pepper and salt to 
taste. If desired, four hard-boiled eggs may be cut up and 
added before serving. This soup should boil three or four 
hours. Three or four ears of grated corn are an improve- 
ment. 

CORN SOUP. 

Cat and scrape about twelve ears of corn. Boil the cote 
about half an hour in one quart, then remove, and add the 



GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



corn. Boil half an hour, and add two quarts of sweet milk. 
Season with pepper, salt, and butter, and thicken with one 
table-spoonful of flour that has been dissolved in a little of 
the milk. Let all boil about fifteen minutes, then pour over 
the yelks of three eggs, which have been well beaten in the 
tureen. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

To about two pounds of fresh beef or shank-bone, put three 
quarts of water, and season with pepper and salt. When 
boiled and skimmed, add one quart of ripe tomatoes that 
have been skinned and quartered, a large onion cut up fine, 
and a little thyme. Boil until the tomatoes are all dissolved. 
It may be thickened with rice, flour, or vermicelli. 

TOMATO SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

To one quart of prepared tomatoes, cooked and seasoned as 
for table use, add a salt-spoonful of soda, and one quart of 
milk, boiled and thickened to the consistency of drawn but- 
ter, with two table-spoonfuls of flour. Mix and strain into 
the tureen. Serve immediately. 

GREEN-PEA SOUP.— NO. I. 

Put two pounds of veal, lamb, or beef, and a quarter of a 
pound of fat salt pork sliced thin, into two quarts of water. 
Set it over a moderate fire, and when it boils skim it clear. 
Add a quart of shelled peas, and a dozen small new Irish po- 
tatoes, well scraped. Cover closely for an hour, or until the 
peas are tender; then add half a tea-cup of sweet butter 
with a heaping tea-spoonful of flour worked into it. Pepper 
and salt to taste. 

GREEN-PEA SOUP.— NO. 2. 

Take about four quarts of peas, shell and boil the pods in 
about as much water as you want soup. When the sweet- 
ness is extracted, strain the water, return to the kettle and 



soups. 7 

add the peas. Boil three quarters of an hour; then add one 
tea-cup of milk, thickened with a tea-spoonful of flour and 
two or three young onions, cut fine and fried in butter. On 
serving, add the yelks of three eggs, beaten in a little cream 
or butter. Season with pepper and salt. 

SPLIT-PEA SOUP. 

Put one pint of split peas into two quarts of water. Boil 
until you can mash them, which will be in about two hours, 
then pass through a sieve. Pour the liquor and the peas 
back into the pot, and add boiling water to make it of proper 
consistency, one small spoonful of lard, or a small slice of 
bacon, and salt and cayenne pepper to taste. If not as thick 
as you desire, thicken with a little flour. Boil until done. 
Toast some bread, cut it in small pieces, put them in the 
tureen, and pour the soup over them. 

VEGETABLE SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. 

Slice a few onions and fry brown ; add as much flour as is 
needed to thieken a pint of water. When nearly done add a 
dessert-spoonful of butter, stir quickly, and add one pint of 
water and one pint of milk. Toast to a veiy light brown a 
couple slices of bread, and crush into the soup. Cover up 
for a few minutes. Just before serving, add two hard-boiled 
eggs, chopped fine. 

VEGETABLE SOUP FOR WINTER USE. 

One bushel of skinned tomatoes, one peck of okra cut up, 
six red peppers without the seeds, two dessert-spoonfuls of 
ground black pepper, four table-spoonfuls of salt. Cook all 
together until it is a thick marmalade. Put up hot in close 
jars for winter use. When wanted for table, add beef-water 
in quantities to suit the family taste, adding seasoning or 
not, as you choose. Of course, some additional boiling will 
be needed to thoroughly incorporate the water. 



GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



SCOTCH BROTH. 

On four pounds of good beef pour one gallon of cold water. 
When this boils add one half pint of coarse barley. Then 
prepare and add one fourth of a small cabbage, four carrots, 
two parsnips, four turnips, one and a half pints of Irish pota- 
toes; these should all be chopped fine before adding. Three 
quarters of an hour before serving, add one good-sized onion, 
cut fine, a sprig of parsley, and pepper and salt to taste. 
This should cook at least four hours. A pint of green peas is 
a great improvement, to be added with the onion, parsley, etc. 

OX-TAIL SOUP. 

Cut up two or three ox-tails, separating them at the joints. 
Put them in a stew-pan with one and a half ounces of butter, 
two carrots cut in slices, one stalk of celery, two turnips, a 
quarter of a pound of lean ham cut in pieces, a tea-spoonful of 
whole pepper, a sprig of parsley and thyme, and half a pint 
of cold water. Stir over a quick fire to extract the flavor of 
the herbs, then pour on three quarts of water. Simmer 
four hours, or until the tails are tender, skimming well. 
Strain the soup, reserving the ox-tails. Stir in a little flour 
for thickening, a wine-glass of Madeira wine, one of catchup, 
and a half stalk of celery, previously boiled Put the pieces 
of ox-tail into the strained soup, boil a few minutes, and 
serve. 

CHICKEN SOUP. 

Cut up one chicken and boil in three quarts of water till 
the strength is extracted. Then add two table-spoonfuls of 
rice, a sprig of parsley and thyme, and salt and pepper to 
taste. Before serving, add two hard-boiled eggs, chopped 
fine, and if the chicken is not fat, a table-spoonful of butter. 

OYSTER SOUP.— NO. i. 
Take one hundred oysters, with two quarts of the liquor 



soups. 9 

strained. Boil until the oysters begin to curl; then add two 
table-spoonfuls of butter, mixed with one table-spoonful of 
flour. Season to taste with pepper, salt, and allspice. Serve 
with slices of toasted bread or broken crackers. 

OYSTER SOUP.— NO. 2. 

To two quarts of strained oyster-liquor, boiling, add one 
hundred oysters, with salt and pepper to taste. Let all boil 
together till the edges of the oysters curl, skimming con- 
stantly. Kemove the oysters to the tureen, and thicken the 
soup with one table-spoonful of flour, rubbed in two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter. Boil in a separate vessel — to pre- 
vent curdling — one quart of sweet milk, and pour in the 
tureen, pouring in the soup last. 

TURTLE SOUP. 

Take a turtle weighing eight or ten pounds, cut its head 
off and let it drain. Take it from the shell, select the liver 
and other parts used, being careful to remove the gall. 
Quarter the turtle, lay it in a pan, pour boiling water over it, 
then scrape it clean and cut the claws off; then lay it in cold 
water, wash it thoroughly, and wipe dry. Put into a soup- 
kettle one large table-spoonful of lard, and four of flour. Let 
it fry until the flour is brown; add to it a medium-sized 
onion, chopped fine. Cut the meat into small pieces and fry, 
as you would chicken, in lard and flour, for a short time. 
Put all into the kettle, adding one gallon of water; boil 
slowly until reduced one half. When the meat is tender add 
spices as follows: One small table spoonful of cinnamon, 
one tea-spoonful of mace, and twelve or fifteen cloves, beaten 
fine; also, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper, both cayenne 
and black. Then add one tumbler of Madeira, and one-half 
tumbler of claret. If the turtle has eggs, put them in about 
fifteen minutes before the soup is served. When ready to 



10 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

serve, add the juice and rind of one lemon. Gopher is an 
excellent substitute for turtle. 

MOCK-TURTLE SOUP. 

Take about two pounds of beet, lamb, fowl, pig's-head, or 
tongue; any of these kinds of meat will make good soup. 
Boil the meat well, take it .out, cut it in small pieces, and 
put back into the soup. Season it with one tea-spoonful of 
mace, one of cloves, one of cinnamon, one dozen of whole 
black pepper, one small onion, chopped fine. Grind the 
spices before adding them. Brown one tea-cup of flour to 
thicken the soup; burn two table-spoonfuls of sugar, and 
add, with six hard-boiled eggs, the yelks being rubbed fine, 
and one tea-cup of tomato catchup. Boil all these ingredients 
until done, and just before serving add a glass of claret or 
other wine. Put the soup on as soon after breakfast as pos- 
sible. 

GRAVY SOUP. 

Boil your soup-meat until tender, then chop it fine. (Beef- 
steak "left over" is better than meat, and does not require 
to be boiled.) Brown two table spoonfuls of flour with a tea- 
spoonful of butter. Cut up two onions into it, add your 
meat, and enough of the pot-liquor to moisten it (if beef-steak 
is used, moisten with water); let it fry ten minutes, then re- 
turn to the soup-pot. Cut up three carrots, three turnips, and 
one can of tomatoes, very fine, and put them into the soup. 
Boil two eggs hard, and add, a quarter of an hour before 
dishing, a salt-spoonful of ground mace and a tea-spoonful 
of ground cloves. Before sending to table add a tumbler 
and a half of claret. Serve with rice. 

CLAM SOUP. 

Open the clams by putting them in a pot with a little 
water, and steaming them until the shells begin to pail, 



SOUPS. 11 

when they can be taken out with ease. Boil them well, and 
when they have been chopped fine add enough of the liquor 
to make them taste well, a lump of butter rolled in flour, two 
crackers rolled fine, a tea-spoonful of mace, and half that 
quantity of cayenne pepper. When ready to be served, add 
a tea-cup of sweet cream. 

EGG-BALLS FOR SOUP. 

Take the yelks of eight eggs, boiled hard, and mash them 
smooth with a little flour, salt, and the yelks of two raw 
eggs. Mix well together, roll into balls, and drop into boil- 
ing water. 

RED-FISH SOUP. 

One large table-spoonful of lard, and the same of flour, put 
in a soup-pot to brown ; two large onions, some thyme and 
parsley chopped up fine and put in with the gravy of lard 
and flour. Let them brown a little; add one can of tomatoes 
(or one quart of fresh ones). Pour on two quarts of water, 
and let it boil. For a four-o'clock dinner put this dn at 
noon, and let it boil until half an hour before dinner ; then 
have a small red-fish (or any coarse-grained fish) sliced in 
pieces, about half the size of your hand. Put in the fish 
with one large lemon, sliced, one table-spoonful of whole 
allspice, salt, red, and black pepper, and a little more than a 
pint of claret. Serve with rice. 

CUBION. 

Stir into two table-spoonfuls of hot lard sufficient flour to 
brown it, and red and black pepper to taste. Then add 
eight onions, sliced, a large bunch of parsley chopped fine, a 
little thyme, and one quart of tomatoes. Let these cook fif- 
teen minutes, stirring all the time ; then add two quarts of 
boiling water, and boil slowly for three hours. Three quar- 
ters of an hour bef ne serving a Id one quart of claret, one 



12 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

table-spoonful of whole allspice, and one large lemon, sliced 
thin. Cut your red-fish in pieces about three or four inches 
square, bones and all, and half an hour before serving put it 
it in and let it boil until dinner. Serve with rice, as gumbo. 
Salt to taste. 

DAUPHINE SOUP. 

Place in a stew-pan half a pint of water, half a pint of lean 
ham, six apples, one onion, two cloves of garlic, one carrot, 
one turnip, and a knuckle of veal. Boil briskly over a quick 
fire, stirring occasionally. Let all cook until the bottom of 
the stew-pan is covered with a brownish glaze; then add 
three table-spoonfuls of curry-powder, one of curry-paste, 
and half a pound of flour. Mix well, and pour on a gallon 
of water; add a table-spoonful of salt, and half as much 
sugar. Let all boil up once; then remove to the back of the 
stove, and let simmer two and a half hours, skimming off the 
fat as it rises. Strain into the tureen and serve. 

GUMBO. 

Fry two fowls, old ones are best, with parsley, onions, pep- 
per, salt, and lard or bacon. Put these into the pot with 
water sufficient for the soup, and boil until the flesh drops 
off the bone. Just before taking off the fire, add your oys- 
ters, and a few minutes after a table- spoonful of gumbo pow- 
der, or file' ; scraps of ham or fried sausage are an improve- 
ment. The gumbo does not requh-e boiling after the file' is 
put in. 

OKRA GUMBO. 

Cut up one chicken, sprinkle with flour, and fry till brown ; 
then add one onion and one quart of okra, both chopped 
fine, and fry with the chicken. Pour on three quarts of 
boiling water, and one pint of prepared tomatoes, and pepper 
and salt to taste. Boil three hours and serve with rice. 



soups. 13 

The chicken, okra, a*nd onion should be fried in the vessel in 
which the soup is made, and in a porcelain or tin-lined ves- 
sel, as iron discolors the okra 

CRAB GUMBO. 

Take one dozen large crabs, one cup of butter, and two or 
three onions. Wash the crabs, taking care to get them free 
ti-om sand; take off the feelers and gills and divide the crabs 
into quarters; brown the onions in the butter with two ta- 
ble-spoonfuls of flour. Put in the crabs with about a hand- 
ful of chopped ham. Fill up the pot with three quarts of 
cold water. Just before serving sift in about two table-spoon- 
fuls of file'. Do not let it boil after the file' is put in. Serve 
with rice. 

OYSTER GUMBO. 

Cut up a chicken, sprinkle with flour, and fry in the ves- 
sel in which the gumbo is made. When the chicken is 
nearly done, chop an onion and fry with it. Pour on this 
three quarts of boiling water and let it boil slowly till the 
flesh leaves the bones; then add the liquor from the oysters, 
salt and pepper to taste, two table-spoonfuls of tomato catch- 
up: let this boil a short time, then add one hundred oys- 
ters, and allow them to boil only five minutes. When taken 
from the fire, and before pouring into the tureen, sprinkle 
in two table-spoonfuls of file' or sassafras powder. 

TO PREPARE FILE 7 FOR GUMBO. 

Gather sassafras leaves as late as possible in the season, 
before they turn red. Put them in the shade and open air 
to dry. When perfectly dry pound them, sift the powder, 
bottle it, and keep tightly corked. 

GUMBO CHOU. 

Boil the cabbage, take out and chop very fine, sprinkle 
with a little flour and put into hot lard with water enough 



14 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

to keep from burning. Add one pint of oysters and oyster- 
liquor, one tea-cup of tomatoes, salt and pepjJer to taste. Just 
before dishing add three table-spoonfuls of molasses. Serve 
with rice boiled dry. 

GOPHER SOUP. 

For a large gopher take two table-spoonfuls of lard, five 
of flour, and one onion, chopped fine. Put the lard in the 
pot in which the soup is made, and when it is boiling hot 
add the flour ; when it is nicely browned add the onion and 
fry quite brown. Then put the meat in, fry fifteen minutes, 
then add three or four quarts of boiling water. About an 
hour and a half before serving, season with thyme, parsley, 
a little mace, cinnamon, cloves, allspice. * The spices should 
be beaten and tied up in a bag, and the bag removed before 
serving. If there are gopher eggs put them in half an hour 
before dinner. Just before serving add one pint of Madeira, 
two of claret. This soup requires four hours' gentle boiling. 
Season with salt and pepper after adding the boiling water. 
The wine is a^great improvement, but the soup is very nice 
without it.

Serve with drawn butter, and garnish with hard-boiled eggs. 

BOILED RED-FISH. 

Tie a large, solid fish in a domestic bag, and lay it in a 
long baking-pan on top of the stove, with enough water to 
cover it. Let it boil half an hour, turning it over carefully, 
that both sides may be well done. Serve with butter-sauce, 
for which take three table-spoonfuls of butter and one of 
sifted flour. Mix the flour and butter together, and have 
ready about a pint of boiling water. Stir the butter and 
flour in while boiling, being careful not to let lumps form. 
Boil four eggs hard ; when cold, slice over the fish, seasoning 
well with black pepper and salt; then pour the sauce over 
the whole. 

STEWED FISH, WITH OYSTERS 

Cut the fish in pieces two inches thick. Put in a stew-pan 
a quarter of a pound of butter, a table-spoonful of flour, one 
onion minced fine, a little parsley and celery. Let this come 
to a boil; then add the fish, one pint of oyster liquor, the 
juice of a lemon, pepper and salt. Stew quickly, shaking 
the pan frequently. When nearly done, add two dozen oys 
ters. Cook five minutes longer. Keep the pan well covered. 
to retain the flavor.

Free the fish from the bones, and cut up in small pieces, 
with chopped onions, parsley, salt, and pepper. Beat two 
eggs well with one table-spoonful of catchup. Mix all together, 
and put in a baking-dish, with three slices of bacon over it. 
Bake a short time, and serve with melted butter. 

CHOWDER.— NO. i. 

Boil half a pound of salt pork, cut it into slips, and cover 
the bottom of a pot with some of them ; then strew in some 
sliced onions. Have ready a largo fresh fish, cut it in large 
pieces, and lay part of them on the pork and onions, season- 
ing with pepper and salt. Then cover it with a layer of 
biscuit or cracker that has been soaked in milk or water; and 
on this put a layer of sliced potatoes. Then put a second 
layer of pork and onions, fish, cracker, etc., and continue 
this till the pot is nearly full, finishing with soaked crackers. 
Put in about one and a half pints of cold water, cover the 
pot closely, set it on the stove, and let it simmer about an 
hour. Then skim it, and turn it out in a deep dish. Leave 
the gravy in the pot until you have thickened it with a bit of 



20 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

butter rolled in flour, some chopped parsley, and a table- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Give it one boil up, and 
pour in the dish. 

FISH CHOWDER.— NO. 2. 

Take a red or any other firm fish, cut it in pieces about 
three inches square; one pound and a half of salt pork cut 
m thin slices; one dozen and a half of Irish potatoes, and 
the same of tomatoes, both sliced thin ; half a dozen onions 
cut fine, and one dozen hard crackers broken in small pieces. 
Take a large pot, put a layer of pork on the bottom, then a 
layer each of fish, potatoes, tomatoes, onions, and crackers. 
Sprinkle each layer with a little salt, black pepper, and flour. 
Repeat the layers of pork, fish, potatoes, etc., until all are 
used. Fill with hot water until it covers the whole. Put 
the pot on the fire, and let it boil thirty minutes; then add 
a pint of claret and boil five minutes longer. The chowder 
will then be ready for the table. 

FISH-PUDDING. 

Take three pounds of fresh fish, boil in the evening, take 
out the bones, mince the fish quite fine. In the morning, 
make a sauce of one pint of milk, three eggs, throe table- 
spoonfuls of flour, one table-spoonful of butter, a tea-spoonful 
of salt, the same of black pepper. Boil all together, and 
mix with the fish. Put all in a pudding-dish, and bake half 
an hour. Serve hot. 

HOW SALT FISH SHOULD BE FRESHENED. 

Mackerel, or any other salt fish, should be soaked in fresh 
water, with the flesh side down, as the salt falls to the bot- 
tom. If the skin is down, the fish comes out nearly as salty 
as when put in. 

FRESH FISH-BALLS. 
Pick clear of bones fish left from a dinner. Mix with this 



FISH, CRABS, ETC. 21 



as much bread-crumbs as fish, season nicely with pepper and 
salt, add one or two well-beaten eggs, and fry in hot lard. 
Eat with salad-dressing. » 

COD-FISH BALLS.— NO. i. 

Soak the cod in cold water in the morning, or over night. 
Change the water, and let it scald for an hour. Then boil 
five or six minutes. Chop very fine, and mix well with po- 
tatoes, using equal quantities of fish and potatoes, and ad- 
ding butter, pepper, and milk, to soften. Make in small 
cakes and fry in lard. 

COD-FISH BALLS.— NO. 2. 

If intended for breakfast, soak the fish in cold water over 
night. Do not boil. In the morning take it from the water 
and place near the fire, where it may become warm while 
taking off the skin and picking the fish in small bits from 
the bone. Have boiled, meantime, some good Irish potatoes, 
— say about six or eight, for a good-sized fish. Take off the 
skins and mash while hot, with the fish adding a large 
table-spoonful of butter and one egg beaten. If too dry 
to make into balls, add a little sweet cream. Season with 
a little pepper. Make up into balls about the size of a bis- 
cuit. Roll them in flour, and fry in hot lard sufficient to 
swim the balls. When done, they will be a light brown. 

FRIED EELS. 

Cut the eels in pieces about four inches long. Beat some 
eggs, seasoning with pepper and salt to taste. Dip the 
pieces of eel in the egg, then in bread or cracker crumbs, 
and fry in hot lard. 

STEWED CRABS.— NO. 1. 

Scald the crabs, cut the bodies into four parts, pick the 
meat out of the claws. Take the yelks of two hard-boiled 



22 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

eggs, and rub them smooth in a desert-spoonful of vinegar. 
Koll some butter in flour; mince a small onion very fine. 
Put the crabs and these ingredients, with salt and pepper to 
taste, into a stew-pan. Cover them with about a pint of 
water, and let them cook slowly. When served, garnish the 
dish with sippets of toasted bread. 

STEWED CRABS.— NO. 2. 

Boil a dozen crabs, and pick them out, being careful not 
to leave a particle of shell with the crabs. Take a cup about 
three fourths full of butter, one large onion, one pod of red 
pepper. Fry the onion and pepper in the butter, with two 
table-spoonfuls of flour, browning them nicely. Put in the 
crab, stir up well, add half a pint of water, and black pepper 
and salt to taste. Let it stew gently ten or fifteen minutes. 
A couple of tomatoes chopped and added to this stew is an 
improvement. 

STEWED CRABS.— NO. 3. 

Take one dozen crabs well picked from the shell after be- 
ing boiled. Boil one pint of fresh milk, with a tea-spoonful 
of finely-chopped onion, one table-spoonful of butter, salt, 
red and black pepper to taste, a pinch of mace, allspice, and 
one nutmeg grated, the whites of four hard-boiled eggs chop- 
ped fine, the yelks of the same rubbed smooth with a little 
milk. When this boils, add flhree or four table-spoonfuls of 
powdered crackers, and cook until the onions are quite done. 
Then put in half a pint of fresh cream and the crabs. Let 
all boil together, a few minutes only. Serve with lemon- 
juice and sherry wine to your taste. It is necessary to stew 
quickly all the time. If too thick, add either milk or cream, 
whichever is most convenient. 

FRICASSEED CRABS. 
Boil and pick out the crabs; put them into a dish with 
black pepper, mustard, a small onion, thyme, and a large 



FISH, CRABS, ETC. 23 



spoonful of butter with a tea-spoonful of flour rubbed into it. 

Add a tea-cup of water, grate bread-crumbs over them, and 

bake. 

t 

CRAB OMELET. 

Take six or eight crabs. Prepare them by boiling and 
picking from the shell. Chop one onion fine, and fry it 
brown; then take it out of the pan. Then beat as if for cake 
six eggs ; chop very fine one slice of ham and a small bunch 
of parsley. Put all together and stir well. Have the lard 
out of which you have taken the onion hot, and put in it the 
crab, egg, etc., stirring all until heated through. Just before 
taking off the fire, stir in a table-spoonful of butter. Roll it 
up as you would an egg omelet. 

MOCK TERRAPIN. 

Take half a calf 's-liver, season and fry brown ; hash it, but 
not too fine. Dash thickly with flour, and add one tea- 
spoonful of mixed mustard, a pinch of cayenne pepper, the 
same of cloves, two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, a large 
table-spoonful of butter, one tea-cup of water. Let all boil 
two or three minutes, then add a wine-glass of wine. Cold 
veal may be used, if liver is not liked. 

STEWED TERRAPIN.— NO. I. 

Boil six diamond-back terrapins whole, for about fifteen 
minutes ; then take them out, pressing the liquor from them. 
Skim and strain the liquor. Cut the terrapins up, cleaning 
the entrails and removing the gall. Then put back into the 
liquor, and boil until done. Add the dressing, consisting of 
six wine-glasses of fine sherry, one pound of butter, one 
quart of cream, half a pound of flour well sifted, the yelks of 
six hard-boiled eggs, cayenne pepper and salt. Boil ten 
minutes, add lemon to taste, and serve. 



24 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

STEWED TERRAPIN.— NO. 2. 

Cut open your terrapin, take out the eggs, cut oft' the feet 
and legs; wash in pure water, then scald the legs and rub 
off the outer skin. Stew till tender, keeping the sauce-pan 
tightly covered; put in the eggs ten minutes before it is 
dished. .Fry two onions and three spoonfuls of flour in one 
of lard. Pour the terrapin and gravy on this, seasoning 
with salt and pepper to taste. Before serving, add spices, 
two spoonfuls of whisky, four spoonfuls of wine. Garnish 
the dish with lemon cut in slices. 

TERRAPIN AU GRATIN. 

Terrapin well cooked in a little water, with onion, salt, and 
pepper. Then put it in the upper shell, with a spoonful of 
butter, a little mace, grated cracker on top with an egg well 
beaten. Bake until brown. Serve with lemon. 

SHRIMP STEWED WITH TOMATOES. 

Take one can of shrimps, one can of tomatoes; add salt, 
pepper, and butter to your taste, then stew twenty minutes 

SHRIMP SALAD. 

Boil the shrimps in salt-water, and remove the shells. Then 
make a dressing of the yelks of four hard-boiled eggs, cream- 
ed until smooth, one fourth of a tea-spoonful of cayenne pep- 
per, one tea-spoonful of black pepper, two table-spoonfuls oi 
mustard, and one of salt, one tea-cup of vinegar, two table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil. When thoroughly mixed, pour over 
the shrimp. This dressing will do for crabs also. 

TO POT SHRIMPS. 

Let the fish be freshly boiled, then shell them. Melt down 
with a gentle degree of heat some good butter; skim and 
pour it clear of sediment into a porcelain sauce-pan. Add a 
small quantity of salt, mace, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper. 



FISH, CRABS, ETC. 25 

When these have just simmered for three or four minutes, 
throw in the fish; toss them in the butter, that, they may be 
well covered with it; let them heat through by the side of 
the fire, but by no means allow them to boil. Turn them 
into shallow dishes, and press them down into the butter. 
Should they not be well covered, pour a little more over 
them. Shrimps, one pint; butter, four or -five ounces; mace, 
nutmeg, pepper, and salt to taste

OYSTERS. 



FRIED OYSTERS.— No. I. 

Select large oysters, drain and spread on a cloth to absorb 
all moisture. Beat well two or three eggs, and season them 
with pepper and salt. Roll some crackers, and dip the oysters 
in the egg and then in the crumbs, then again in the egg 
and cracker crumbs. Drop into boiling lard, sufficient to 
cover them, and cook till of a light brown. 

FRIED OYSTERS.— No. 2. 

Drain large oysters and lay on a napkin. Beat well two 
eggs, and season with pepper and salt. Dip one oyster at a 
time first in the egg and then in corn-meal. Drop in boil- 
ing lard and fry a light brown. 

OYSTER LOAVES. 

Cut off carefully the end of a loaf of baker's bread, reserv- 
ing the end; scoop out the crumb inside the loaf, leaving the 
crust entire. Fill the loaf with hot oysters, fried as in No. 
1, leaving room for slices of pickle. Carefully replace the 
end cut off. If the oysters are hot, and the loaf well cover- 
ed, they can be carried quite a distance, or eaten some time 
alter being prepared, without getting cold. This is nice for 
a hasty lunch or a late supper. One dozen oysters will fill 
an ordinary sized loaf. 

FRENCH STEWED OYSTERS. 
Drain fifty large oysters, and strain the liquor into a stew- 



YSTERS. 27 

pan, seasoning with mace, half a pint of sherry wine, and 
the juice of two lemons. When this comes to a boil, stir well 
and skim; put in the oysters, not allowing them to boil as 
much as in an ordinary oyster stew. 

FRANK'S STEWED OYSTERS. 

For one hundred oysters take one pound of butter. Drain 
the oysters, put the butter in a sauce-pan, or chafing-dish, 
and when it is hot add the oysters, seasoning them highly 
with black pepper and salt. Let them stew gently until 
done. Break up about half a dozen crackers in small pieces, 
and sprinkle on top. Serve immediately. 

STEWED OYSTERS.— No. I. 

Take fifty oysters, and all of the liquor; one pint of new 
milk, one tea-cup of sweet cream, two table-spoonfuls of 
flour with one of butter creamed with it, one dessert-spoon- 
ful of black pepper, and a very little cayenne. Salt to the 
taste just before dishing. 

STEWED OYSTERS.— No. 2. 

Take one hundred oysters and sti*ain the liquor to remove 
any fragments of shell. Measure the liquor, and take an 
equal quantity of sweet milk ; boil them in separate vessels. 
To the oyster liquor add a tea-cupful of cracker crumbs, salt 
and pepper to taste, and a large table-spoonful of butter. 
When this has boiled a few minutes add the oysters, which 
will require about five minutes to cook. Pour in a dish, and 
add the boiling milk last. 

STEWED OYSTERS.— No. 3. (For a Pie.) 

Put the oysters in their liquor on the fire. When they 
come to a scald take off and put in a sieve to drain. Strain 
some of the liquor; add butter, flour parsley, and mace; heat 
and put the oysters in it. For soup, use all the liquor, if 



28 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

needed,- and boil a little milk in a separate vessel, and add 
after dishing. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Line a small patty-pan with puff-paste, and bake a light 
brown. When done, fill with oysters stewed as in No. 3. The 
patties should be served and eaten as soon as prepared, as 
the gravy soaking in the pastry will make it moist and 
heavy. 

OYSTER PIE. 

Butter a dish and spread rich pastry on the sides, but not 
on the bottom. Season the oysters with butter, pepper, and 
salt, and place them in the lined dish, with sufficient liquor 
to fill it. Over the top, sprinkle three hard-boiled eggs, chop- 
ped fine, and bread or cracker crumbs. Cover the whole 
with pastry, and bake in a quick oven. 

OYSTER FRITTERS.— No. i. 

Take one pint of milk, two well-beaten eggs, and flour to 
make a smooth but rather thin batter. Season with pepper 
and salt. Stir in fifty large oysters; drop a spoonful of bat- 
ter into boiling lard, having one or two oysters in each 
spoonful; cook brown, turning carefully to cook on both sides.. 

OYSTER FRITTERS.— No. 2. 

Beat two eggs very light; stir in two table-spoonfuls of 
cream, three table-spoonfuls of flour, and pepper and salt to 
taste. Dip the oysters in this batter, and fry in boiling 
lard. 

MINCED OYSTERS. 

Take fifty oysters chopped fine; add one table-spoonful of 
chopped parsley, one of butter, one tea-spoonful of black 
pepper, six eggs well beaten, and enough crackers rubbed 
fine to make it the proper consistenc}^ to roll into balls. Fry 
quickly in boiling lard. 



YSTERS. 29 

. OYSTER SAUSAGE. 

Take three or four dozen large oysters; cut them fine, and 
put in a colander to drain. Chop a small onion, and some 
thyme and parsley very fine. Melt a table-spoonful of butter, 
and pour it on the oysters, after taking them from the colander 
and putting them on a dish ; season with salt and pepper. 
Roll eight large soda-crackers and mix with the other ingre- 
dients; beat two eggs and rub them in with the oysters and 
crackers. Add enough flour to roll into balls, and fry, like 
sausage, in veiy little lard or butter. 

BROILED OYSTERS. 

Drain and dry large .oysters. Have ready an oyster broil- 
er, hot and well-buttered, to prevent sticking. Season the 
oysters and broil well on both sides. Serve in a hot dish, 
with plenty of butter. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

Spread cracker crumbs on the bottom of a buttered baking- 
dish; place on these a layer of oysters, with pepper, salt, and 
hits of butter. Make alternate layers of crumbs and seasoned 
oysters till the dish is full, having a layer of crumbs on top. 
Make an incision in the center and pour in one well-beaten 
egg. Use butter only, and no oyster liquor. Brown nicely 
in a hot oven. 

OYSTERS WITH FRICASSEED CHICKEN. 

Fry the oysters in bread or cracker crumbs, and egg, a 
light brown. Lay them on the fricasseed chicken, and pour 
a thick-drawn butter-sauce over the whole. 

A NICE WAY TO COOK OYSTERS. 

Procure some nice, large, deop shells, cleanse thoroughly, 
and keep for the purpose. Open the oysters, place one in 
each shell, with a little of the water, a pinch of salt, and 



30 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

black pepper; grate a little Italian cheese over each. Cook 
in the oven of a stove. 

MACARONI AND OYSTERS. 

Boil a quarter of a pound of macaroni in salt-water until 
tender, then drain. Butter an earthen dish, and put in a 
layer of macaroni, then a layer of oysters, sprinkling on the 
oyster layer pepper, salt, and bits of butter, and on the mac- 
aroni layer bits of cheese. Make alternate layers of maca- 
roni and oysters, till the dish is full, having a layer of oys- 
ters on top. Sprinkle cracker crumbs over the whole. Bake 
in a quick oven until brown. # Fifty oysters will be sufficient 
for this quantity of macaroni. 

STEAMED OYSTERS. 

Turn the oysters into a steamer over a pot of boiling 
water; let them steam for half an hour, stirring occasionally. 
Serve in a hot dish with pepper, salt, and plenty of butter. 

PICKLED OYSTERS.— No. I. 

Take one hundred fine, large oysters; drain the liquor 
from them and strain it, to remove all fragments of shell. 
Boil the liquor with one tea-spoonful of salt; when boiling 
drop in the oysters, allowing them to be only well scalded, 
not boiled. Remove the oysters, and add to the liquor one 
pint of strong vinegar, one tea-spoonful of black mace, two 
dozen whole cloves, two dozen whole black pepper, and two 
dozen allspice. Let the liquor, vinegar, and spices come to 
a boil, and when the oysters are cold pour it over them. 
These are for immediate use. If wanted to keep some time, 
allow the oysters to boil, and double the proportions of 
spices and vinegar. 

PICKLED OYSTERS.— No. 2. 
Boil the oysters slightly; then strain the liquor, and to one 



O YSTEKS. 31 



cup of vinegar put two cups of oyster liquor, cloves, allspice, 
mace, pepper, and salt to taste. Boil the liquor, spices, and 
vinegar, and pour over the oysters. When cold they are 
ready for use. 

OYSTER SOUPS AND GUMBO.

32 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 



TO BOIL A HAM. 

Proceed inversely as with a soup-bone, since in the latter 
you wish to extract the juice, whereas in the ham you would 
preserve them. Hence the appropriateness of the directions 
given in chemical lectures to a class of embryo house-keepers, 
by Prof. Darby, of prophylactic notoriety. His directions 
are: "Have the pot of water boiling before putting in the 
ham with the skin on. The boiling water instantly coagu- 
lates the albumen, which prevents the escape of the juice." 
Keep the pot boiling constantly for four hours, if it is a ten- 
pound or twelve-pound ham, or longer for a larger ham. Do 
not allow the sight of a protruding bone to induce you to 
take it off too soon. When thoroughly done, remove from the 
pot and take off the skin. The essence which oozes out will 
be jellied when cold, and very nice, while the ham itself is 
tender and delicious, in every respect superior to the less 
boiled ham. 

TO BOIL FRESH-PORK HAM. 

Take sufficient boiling water to cover the ham. Put in 
this two quarts of salt, one half cup of dark molasses or 
brown sugar, a handful of whole black pepper, saltpeter the 
size of a large pea. Put the ham in this boiling mixture, and 
boil until thoroughly done, which will probably be when the 
meat leaves the knuckle-bone. Let this cool in the water in 
in which it is boiled, as all corned meats should. 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 33 

BAKED STUFFED HAM. 

Take a ham, wash well, put in a pot of hot water, and let 
it boil three hours. When nearly cold, take off the skin. 
Make a rich dressing of one loaf of baker's bread, three large 
onions chopped fine, one large table-spoonful of butter, one 
tea-spoonful of celery-seed, one of ground sage, and one of 
thyme; salt and pepper to your taste (a good deal of pepper); 
cook as you would dressing for a turkey. Make deep in- 
cisions in the ham, and fill them with the dressing in such a 
way that each slice may have some of the dressing in it. 
Two eggs well beaten and mixed with cracker crumbs, spread 
over the ham; and sprinkle brown sugar over this. Bake 
slowly for two and a half or three hours, basting frequently 
with the juice which runs from the ham. 

BAKED HAM. 

Soak the ham twenty-four hours, changing the water once 
or twice. Then skin and trim the ham. Take a quarter of 
a pound of fresh pork chopped very fine, two table-spoonfuls 
of pulverized sage, one table-spoonful of black pepper, one 
tea-spoonful of cloves, allspice, and cinamon combined, one. 
onion chopped very fine. Moisten the mixture thoroughly 
with pepper-vinegar. Then, with a sharp knife make the 
incisions in the ham, starting toward the large end of the 
ham. Make one incision on the under side. Fill them with 
the stuffing. Put in the pan for baking. Sift well over with 
flour ; and if the pan is deep, fill half full with water. Baste 
as you would a fowl. It will take from three to four hours 
to bake, according to the size. 

ROAST PIG.— No. i. 

Take a pig of about eight or ten pounds; clean well, leav- 
ing on the head and feet. Make a stuffing of bread, two 
eggs, one table-spoonful of butter, sage, thyme, onion chop 
ped, and pepper and salt. Stale bread is best. Soften with 

3 



34 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

water, and put in a frying-pan, with a table-spoonful of lard 
to brown, mixing in the eggs, butter, and seasoning. When 
brown, stuff the pig and sew up the opening. Truss with 
the front legs bent backward and the back legs forward. 
Kub the pig with lard, and baste frequently. Cook till thor- 
oughly done, and make the gravy (after removing the pig) 
by adding a little water thickened with flour, and the liver 
and heart of the pig (which have been cooked in the pan 
with it) chopped fine and mixed in. Serve in a gravy-dish. 

ROAST PIG.— No. 2. 

Shave off all the hairs, or burn them off with a white-hot 
poker, using it carefully and quickly enough not to burn the 
skin. Dress the pig, saving the heart, liver, and kidneys, 
which you must wash, slice, fry in a very little fat, and then 
chop fine. Wash the pig; dry it well with a clean cloth; 
stuff it with the following force-meat; sew it up; tie or 
skewer the legs in place ; tie up the ears and tail in buttered 
papers, to prevent burning, and put it into a dripping-pan, 
with the following vegetables: Half a medium-sized carrot, 
one onion, a few sprigs of parsley, and a bay-leaf. Brush 
the pig thoroughly with salad-oil or melted butter. Put it 
into a hot oven until the crackling is set, basting it every fif- 
teen minutes. A medium-sized pig will cook in from two to 
two and a half hours. 

Stuffing for it. — Fry together two ounces of sweet drip- 
pings or butter, half an ounce of chopped parsley, and about 
four ounces of chopped onion; season with one level table- 
spoonful each of powdered sage, thyme, and salt, and a level 
tea-spoonful of pepper. Soak half a pound of dry bread in 
tepid water for five minutes, then wring it dry in a towel. 
Add it to the onion and herbs, stir it until it is scalding hot, 
add the fried liver, the yelks of two eggs, and half a pint of 
boiling milk or water, and stuff the pig with it. Wash eight 
firm apples ; cut them across the middle, but not down from 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 35 

the stein to the blossom; scoop out the cores, and bake only 
until tender, but not broken down. Peel and core eight 
more apples; stew them with a little sugar and the rind of a 
lemon. When perfectly tender, pass them through a sieve, 
and fill the halves of apple with this pure'e. Set them around 
the pig on a platter, and put a small lemon or sprig of holly 
in its mouth. 

i SAUSAGE. 

In making sausage, allow one third fat to two thirds lean. 
Grind through a sausage-grinder, and season to taste with 
pepper, salt, and powdered sage-leaves. Make in small cakes, 
and fry without lard. 

BAKED SAUSAGE-MEAT. 

A medium-sized loaf of bread, eight pounds of beef, four 
pounds of fresh pork ground in a sausage-grinder, one table- 
spoonful of cloves, one large onion chopped fine, a small 
quantity of sage, one table-spoonful of whisky or brandy, 
pepper and salt to taste; cut up some red pepper; mix well 
before placing in pans; insert strips of fresh pork about two 
two inches long, and about an inch apart. Bake about four 
hours; do not take out until perfectly cold; slice crosswise. 
This will keep good some time. 

FRENCH SAUSAGES. 

Chop very fine, or pound in a mortar, equal parts of cold 
fowls, cream, dried bread-crumbs, and boiled onions; season 
them with salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste ; put them into the 
neck, — skins of poultry, — tying the ends, and .fry them as 
you would fry sausages. 

FRICADELS. 

Mix well the following ingredients : Half a pound each 
of sausage-meat, dried bread-crumbs soaked in warm water 
and squeezed dry in a towel, one ounce of onion chopped fine, 



36 • GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

two eggs, one level dessert-spoonful of salt, and half a level 
tea-spoonful of pepper. Eoll in the shape of corks, using a 
little flour to keep them from sticking to the hands, and fry 
brown in plenty of smoking-hot fat. Serve on toast. Any 
other minced meat may be substituted for the sausage-meat. 

PAN HAMS. 

Take hog's head and feet; boil them until the meat falls 
from the bones; withdraw them from the liquor, which 
strain and return to the vessel. Chop the meat very fine ; sea- 
son with pepper, salt, spice, onions chopped fine, thyme, sage, 
and parsley. Add all to the liquor, adding a sufficient quan- 
tity of corn-meal to make a stiff mush. Let it boil ten min- 
utes, stirring all the time. Pour into a deep pan ; when cold, 
•cut in thin slices and fry. 

PIG'S-FEET FRIED. 

Have the feet well cleaned, and boiled until quite tender 
Split them, and lay in vinegar to pickle them. When ready 
to cook, have a batter made of an egg, flour, and water; pep- 
per and salt to the consistency of pudding-batter. Fry in 
hot lard. 

SMOKED MEAT ON TOAST. 
I 
Take a cold, smoked tongue or ham that has been well 

boiled; grate it on a coarse grater, or mince it fine. Mix it 
with cream and beaten yelk of an egg, a little pepper, and 
let it simmer over the fire. Prepare some nice slices of but- 
tered toast; lay them in a dish that has been heated, and 
cover each slice with the meat mixture, which should be 
spread on hot. Place on the table in a covered dish. A 
nice dish for breakfast or tea. 

DEVILED HAM. 

Slice some ham very thin ; sprinkle with cayenne and black 
pepper; broil until well down; place in a dish, and pour 



MEAT, POULTRY, ETC. 37 

over it the following sauce, quite hot : Three table-spoonfuls 
of butter, one of vinegar, one of mustard, and one of Wor- 
cestershire sauce. 

ROAST BEEF. 

The surloin is the best piece of beef for roasting. Rub 
over the meat a little lard, and put in a baking-pan with the 
bone side down. When half done, sprinkle with pepper, salt, 
and flour, and baste frequently with the drippings. To make 
the gravy, remove the meat, and if there is not sufficient 
juice, add a little water and thicken with flour; season with 
pepper and salt to taste. Serve the gravy in a gravy-dish. 

BOEUF S A LA MODE. 

Have a round of beef six inches thick. Take one and a 
half pounds of fresh fat bacon; cut in square pieces one 
fourth of an inch thick and four inches long. Then take one 
half ounce of allspice, one half ounce of cloves, and one 
ounce black pepper ; grind together. To this add a small 
quantity of parsley, thyme, and three small pieces of garlic, 
all cut up fine. Roll the pieces of meat in the seasoning, 
and insert them in the round on both sides. Make incisions, 
and pour the remaining seasoning all over, adding a suffi- 
cient quantity of salt, — say two ounces. Let it stand eight 
hours before cooking. In cooking this, have a close vessel, 
with top to fit (an oven preferable) ; put in a spoonful of lard 
made hot. Place in the round, sprinkled with flour, two 
large onions cut up, and another spoonful of lard. Cover 
closely, and let it cook in its own juice four hours, turning 
it once. 

HUNTER'S ROUND. 

Rub well into a round of beef weighing forty pounds three 
ounces of saltpeter, and let it stand five or six hours. Pound 
three ounces of allspice, one of black pepper, and mix that 



38 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



with twenty pounds of salt and seven or eight pounds of 
brown sugar. Eub the beef well with this mixture, and pack 
it down to stay fourteen days. Scrape off the spices ; place 
it in a deep pan, cover it with a common paste, and bake 
from eight to ten hours. When cool, wrap it in a linen cloth, 
and keep it in a cool place. Nothing nicer for lunch. This 
will keep well for several weeks. 

SPICED BEEF. 

Take a round of beef and rub it well with saltpeter; take 
out the bone in the middle, and fill the opening with salt. 
Bind the round in shape, or put it in a bucket or some vessel 
that fits rather close. Let it stand for three days ; it will 
make its own brine. Then take one spoonful of powdered 
spice, one of black pepper, and one of brown sugar; rub the 
beef well with it. Then, after standing three days, rub it 
again with the spices, etc. After standing a week or ten 
days it will be ready for use. 

TO COLLAR A FLANK OF BEEF. 

Get a nice flank of beef, rub it well with a large portion of 
saltpeter and common salt. Let it remain ten days ; then 
wash it clean, take off the outer and inner skin with the 
gristle; spread it on a board, and cover the inside with the 
following mixture: Parsley, sage, thyme chopped fine, pep- 
per, salt, and pounded cloves. Kollit up; sew a cloth over it, 
and bandage that with tape; boil it gently five or six hours. 
When cold, lay it on a board without undoing it; put anoth- 
er board on the top with a heavy weight. Let it remain 
twenty-four hours; take off the bandages; cut thin slices 
from each end. 

CORNED BEEF. 

To six gallons of water add nine pounds of pure salt, three 
pounds of brown sugar, one quart of molasses, three ounces 
of saltpeter, and one ounce of pearlash. When the water is 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 39 

ready to receive the rest of the material, pour in the salt- 
peter only, and when dissolved, and the water boiling, dip 
your beef piece by piece into the boiling saltpeter-water, 
holding it for a feiv seconds only in the hot bath. When the 
beef has all been immersed and become quite cool, pack it in 
the case where it is to remain. Then proceed with your 
pickle as first directed, and, when perfectly cold, pour it upon 
the meat, which should be kept down by a cover and stone. 

BEEFSTEAK SMOTHERED. 

Have the lard hot in the pan; put in the steak; season 
with pepper, salt, and sifted flour. Put a layer of onions and 
a layer of tomatoes; pour on a little water; then cover with 
another pan, and let it cook until nearly done. Take off the 
cover, and let it brown. 

FRIED BEEFSTEAK.— No. i 

Surloin steaks are much the best for frying or broiling. 
Lay the steak in a frying-pan of hot lard or butter, after it 
has been dredged with flour and well sprinkled with pepper. 
Turn it frequently, until both sides are brown. When nearly 
done, sprinkle with salt. If onions are desired, slice enough 
of them to cover the steak, and fry with the meat. After 
taking the meat out, add a cup of boiling water, and thicken 
with brown flour for gravy. 

FRIED BEEFSTEAK.— No. 2. 

If the steak is not very young and tender, beat it slightly. 
Beat the yelks of two eggs, seasoned with salt and pepper; 
dip the steak in the egg. and then sprinkle over it cracker 
crumbs. Fry in hot lard. 

STUFFED STEAKS BAKED. 

Have a rich dressing as for turkey or sausage-meat, and 
take two steaks an inch thick each; place the dressing be- 
tween them, and secure the dressing by serving them togeth- 



40 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

ex. Have a wire frame rather smaller than the pan to be 
used; place the steaks on the frame, having previously pre- 
pared them with salt and pepper. Place a few bits of lard 
on the top of the steaks, a sufficient quantity of water in the 
pan, and bake; baste often; flour as usual for roasting or 
baking. 

HOW TO COOK A BEEFSTEAK. 

The vessel in which it is to be cooked must be wiped dry ; 
place it on the stove, and let it become hot. Season your 
steak with salt and pepper; then lay it in the hot pan, and 
cover as tight as possible. When the raw meat touches the 
heated pan, of course it will adhere, but in a few seconds it 
will become loosened and juicy; turn the steak frequently, 
but be careful to keep covered. When nearly done, lay a 
piece of butter upon it; and if you want much gravy, add a 
table-spoonful of strong coffee. In three minutes the steak 
will be ready for the table. 

Mutton-ohops may be cooked the same way ; but they re- 
quire a little longer cooking. An excellent gravy can be 
made from them by adding a little cream, thickened with a 
small quantity of flour, into which, when off the fire and 
partly cool, stir the yelk of an egg well beaten. 

BEEF-CAKES. 

Pound some beef that is under-done with a little fat bacon 
or ham; season with pepper, salt, and onions. Make into 
small cakes, and fry them a little brown. Serve them in good 
gravy. 

FORCE MEAT-BALLS 

Mix with half a pound of veal chopped very fine, one half 
pound of pork chopped fine ; season with salt, pepper, a lit- 
tle parsley minced, one table-spoonful of curry-powder, the 
yelk of one egg, a tea- cud of bread-crumbs, softened with 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 41 

cream or milk. They should be made in small balls, and 
fried in hot lard. 

DRY HASH. 

Take cold fresh meat of any kind that has been previously 
cooked ; cut very very fine ; mix with two boiled Irish pota- 
toes well mashed, one egg, one onion minced fino. Season 
with pepper and salt. Put in a dish and bake. 

HASH WITH GRAVY. 

Cut up your cold meat in pieces half an inch thick ; put it 
to stew with half a pint of water, one onion, one Irish pota- 
to chopped fine, one table-spoonful of lard, one table-spoonful 
of flour, pepper and salt to taste, and a little butter. Cook 
until the potato and onion are done. Serve with the gravy. 

BEEF-HEELS. 

Put the feet in hot water, with wood ashes sufficient to 
make a lye; let them stand in this until the hoof is soften- 
ed, so as to pull off; put in cold water and boil until it leaves 
the bones. Take out and put in a bowl ; season with pepper 
and salt, while warm. Take a large spoonful, roll in batter 
or in flour, and fry in hot lard. 

BOILED MUTTON. 

Put a leg of mutton into a boiler, with sufficient hot water 
to cover it; boil steadily; skim well, and keep covered by 
adding hot water. Allow fifteen minutes to every pound 
weight. Do not put in the salt until the meat is nearly done. 
Serve with egg-sauce, and a tea-cup of capers stirred in. If 
capers can not be obtained, cucumber pickles chopped fine is 
a good substitute. 

• ROAST MUTTON. 

A roast of mutton should have lard or butter rubbed over 
it, and when half done a spoonful put in the pan; salt and 



42 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



pepper also. If it is a leg, it is improved by cutting gashes 
and filling them with a dressing made of bread- crumbs, pep- 
per, salt, two eggs, butter or lard. When nearly done, 
dredge it with flour and baste frequently. Send to the table 
with its own gravy, slightly thickened with browned flour. 

FRIED MUTTON-CHOPS. 

Beat some eggs; season with pepper and salt; roll crack- 
ers fine. Dip the mutton-chops one by ono in the egg, then 
in the cracker crumbs. Fry in hot lard. 

Mutton-chops fried in bread-crumbs, laid on macaroni with 
slices of bread fried between, make a pretty dish. 

HASHED MUTTON. 

Cut thin slices of cold mutton, fat and lean; flour these; 
have ready an onion boiled in two or three spoonfuls of water ; 
add a little gravy and the seasoned meat; let it get hot, but 
not enough to boil. Serve in a covered dish. Instead of 
onion, a clove, a spoonful of jelly, one half glass of port wine, 
will give venison flavor, if the mutton is good. 

AN IRISH STEW. 

Take mutton-chops; cover well with water ; let them come 
to a boil ; pour off the water ; add more. Take a lump of but- 
ter the size of an egg, two table-spoonfuls of flour, a tea-cup 
of milk, with pepper and salt to taste; also a few Irish po- 
tatoes and one small onion. Boil until the potatoes are done. 

VEAL LOAF. 

Three and a half pounds of the finest part of lean and fat 
of a leg of veal chopped very fine, three soda-crackers rolled 
fine, two eggs, a piece of butter the size of an egg, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, one of pepper, a thick slice of salt pork 
chopped fine. Mix all together; put bits of butter and 
grated bread-crumbs over it. Bake two hours. Put some 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 43 

Witter in another pan, and set in it the one containing the loaf. 
Bake two hours. To be eaten when cold. Cut in thin slices. 

RICH AMELLA. 

Mince your cold veal in a chopping-bowl, leaving out the 
stringy part. Put into a frying-pan a tea-cupful or more of 
milk or sweet cream, into which stir, when hot, a tablespoon- 
ful of butter and flour well mixed together; then add the 
chopped veal. Add a small piece of onion and thyme, or 
parsley chopped very fine ; heat it well through ; sprinkle 
over it a little mace. This is delicious for breakfast, and can 
be used for patties. 

PRESSED VEAL OR BEEF. 

Three pounds of veal knuckle well broken; boil in a little 
water until very tender; pick the meat to pieces, free from 
gristle and bone. Season the broth highly ; add a little 
lemon-peel; butter in plenty ; mix with the meat; add enough 
bread-crumbs to thicken ; put into molds. Eat when cold. 

VEAL OLIVES. 
Slice as large pieces as you can get from a leg of veal. 
Make a stuffing of grated bread, butter, a small onion cut 
very fine, a tea-spoonful of salt, a little black pepper, and 
spread over the slices of veal; beat an egg and put over the 
stuffing ; roll each slice up tightly, and tie with a thread ; stick 
a few cloves in them; grate bread-crumbs thickly over them, 
after they are put in the skillet with butter, and onions chop- 
ped fine. When done, lay them on a dish, make your gravy, 
and pour over them. Take the threads off, garnish with hard- 
boiled eggs, and serve. Cut the olives in slices. 

CONFEDERATE VEAL. 

Take two pounds of the round of white veal; beat a little ; 
salt well; add plenty of red and black pepper; flour it well, 
and then lard it. Chop fine, parsley, thyme, carrot, and a 



44 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



little celery; spread these over as a paste; then grate the rind 
of a lemon over it. After squeezing the juice of a lemon 
over it, roll it up, tie it with a cord, sprinkle with flour, and 
fry until it is a light brown ; then add one tea-cup of mush- 
rooms. After pouring enough boiling water over it to make 
considerable gravy, let it simmer down; then add one table- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce. 

VEAL CUTLETS. 

1. Broiled. — When properly trimmed, they may be im- 
proved as directed for veal. Salt and pepper both sides; 
spread a little melted butter on both sides, also, by means 
of a brush ; place them on before or under the fire ; baste 
now and then with melted butter; turn over one, two, or 
three times, and when rather overdone, serve with a maitre 
d' hotel sauce spread all over. This way of serving them is 
sometimes called au naturel. 

2. With Crumbs. — When trimmed, dip them in egg beat- 
en with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley ; roll them in. bread- 
crumbs, and then broil and serve them as the above, with a 
maitre d' hotel. 

3. Fines Herbs. — Broil the chops as above, either with 
or without crumbs, and serve them with sauce aux fines 
herbes. 

4. With Mushrooms. — When broiled and dished, sur- 
round them with a garniture of mushrooms, and serve warm. 
When there are several cutlets on the dish, and placed all 
around, overlapping, the garniture may be put in the middle 
of the chops. 

FRIED VEAL-CUTLETS. 



Pepper and salt two pounds of veal, sliced from the leg and 
cut in pieces half the size of your hand. Make a batter of 
two eggs and a little milk well beaten together. Have a tea- 
cupful of bread or cracker crumbs, and dip each piece of veal, 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 45 

first in the egg batter, and then in the crumbs, and fry quick- 
ly in boiling lard. 

VEAL OMELET. 

Three pounds of raw veal ; four slices of salt pork chopped 
fine; three eggs; two table-spoonfuls of cream or milk ; four 
powdered crackers. Season with thyme, one tea-spoonful of 
pepper, one of salt, half a nutmeg. Form into a loaf, and 
bake two or three hours in a slow oven. Baste with a little 
butter melted in hot water. Cut in thin slices for the table. 

WELTON VEAL. 

Boil four eggs hard; slice them, and line a dish. Then 
place a layer of raw veal cut thin. Mix chopped ham with 
one egg and sage for the next layer ; then another of sliced 
veal, and so on, till the dish is full. Don't forget to salt and 
pepper to taste. Cover with aflat cover; put a weight on 
top to press; steam four hours. To be eaten cold, cut in 
thin slices. 

VEAL BOUILLI. 

Take about six pounds of fat veal, and cut in pieces about 
the size for stewing; sprinkle with flour, and fry brown. In 
the same vessel cut up and fry one onion and two pods of 
garlic; then add one pint of prepared tomatoes, one tea- 
spoonful of pepper, and the same of salt. When nearly done, 
cut up and add a sprig of parsley. This will require two 
and one half or three hours slow cooking. 

STUFFED CALF'S-HEAD. 

Put on your calf s-head to boil, with two sets of feet, either 
calf 's-feet or hog's-feet. When perfectly tender, split the 
head on the under side, and carefully remove the bones, not 
breaking the skin ; also, take the bones from the feet, and 
chop fine. Season to your taste with pepper, salt, a little 
onion, or any other seasoning you may fancy. Then stuff 



46 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

the skin and put it in nice shape in the baking-pan ; then 
return it to the stove and let it remain until a light brown; 
then make a dressing of hard-boiled eggs, butter, and the 
brains of calf 's-head. Serve with the head. 

VEAL SWEET-BREAD. 

Take two fresh sweet-breads; parboil them a few min- 
utes; then lay them in cold water. Beat the yelks of two 
eggs; grate some cracker crumbs. When the sweet-breads 
are cold, wipe them dry; then dip them in the egg, and then 
in the crumbs ; then cook them with a little butter, pepper, 
and salt, to a nice brown. Make a gravy by adding a little 
veal gravy to that in which they have been cooked, and the 
juice of a lemon. Toast thin slices of bread, and dip in this 
gravy and lay on the sweat-bread. 

FRIED SWEET-BREADS.— No. i. 

Parboil them a few minutes, then drop them in cold water; 
skin them ; roll them in a little flour, and fry moderately in 
boiling lard, seasoned with salt and pepper. .Remove them 
from the fire, and stir into the gravy a little flour and hot 
water. When this boils, add a wine-glass of wine or catch- 
up. 

FRIED SWEET-BREADS.— No. 2. 

Scald them in salt and water; take out the stringy part; 
then put them in cold water for a few moments; dry them in 
a towel; roll some crackers or bread-crumbs'; dip the sweet- 
bread in the yelk of an egg beaten; roll in the cracker, and 
fry brown in butter. When they are done, put them on a 
dish. Pour into a frying-pan a large cup of sweet cream, a 
little pepper and salt, and a little green parsley chopped fine: 
dust in a very little flour, and when it boils up, pour it over 
the sweet-breads and send to the table hot. 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 47 

A PIE OF SWEET-BREAD AND OYSTERS. 

Boil the sweetbreads tender; season with pepper and salt ; 
make a gravy with the water in which they were boiled, add- 
ing half a cnp of butter, the yelks of two eggs, and a table- 
spoonful of flour. Line the dish with puff-paste ; have the 
same quantity of oysters as of sweet-breads; lay the oysters 
in first; cover with sweet-breads, and fill the dish with gravy ; 
put on the top crust, and bake slowly until done. 

STEWED SWEET-BREADS. 

Prepare them by parboiling and letting them remain a few 
minutes in cold water, to whiten them. Stew in oyster-liquor 
until tender; then take them off and remove the gristle, and 
season with salt and pepper, a few oysters, and a large table- 
spoonful of butter. Pour on buttered toast. 

Toast that is placed in the bottom of a dish upon which 
stews or gravies are to be poured, should be trimmed of the 
crust and dipped for a few minutes in hot water. 

BAKED SWEET-BREAD. 

Boil it half an hour; then throw it in cold water, to plump 
out ; roll it in eggs and bread-crumbs, seasoned with salt and 
pepper. Lay them in the pan, put a lump of butter on each, 
and bake them. 

FRIED LIVER. 

Put in a frying-pan some slices of bacon, and fry out the 
grease, or a large spoonful of lard. Cut the liver in thin 
slices; season with pepper and salt; dredge with flower, and 
fry a good brown. It will require a longer time to cook than 
most meats. After taking up the liver, pour a little boiling 
water to the grease in which the liver has been fried, and 
sprinkle in a little flour to thicken the gravy. Let it boil 
up, and pour over the liver. 



48 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

BEEF-KIDNEYS FRIED. 

Kemove all the fat and skin from the kidneys; cut in thin 
slices; mix with cayenne pepper, salt, parsley, "and onion 
chopped fine ; dredge with flour, and fry in hot lard. When 
the kidneys are taken out, add to the gravy a wine-glass of 
wine, a little lemon-juice, and a tablespoonful of butter. 

KIDNEYS STEWED. 

Take a set of kidneys and put in a stew-pan, with one half 
pint of water, two table -spoonfuls of butter, three onions 
sliced thin, pepper and salt, and a spoonful of flour. 

TO BOIL SMOKED TONGUE. 

Soak in cold water all night; put to boil in a pot of cold 
water. Boil gently for four or five hours. When done, peel 
and trim. 

BAKED TONGUE WITH TOMATO-SAUCE. 

Parboil a fresh tongue in salt-water until done enough to 
peel. Make a sauce of about one dozen ripe tomatoes, one 
large onion, black pepper, and salt; stew fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Put the tongue in a baking-pan, pour over it the 
sauce, and bake a nice brown. 

STEWED BRAINS. 

Scald a set of brains, to draw off the skin and blood. Put 
the brains in a stew-pan, with just enough water to keep 
them from burning. Season with a large table-spoonful of 
butter; pepper and salt to taste. When done, stir in one 
table-spoonful of cream or milk, with one table-spoonful of 
flour. 

BRAINS FRIED. 

Scald a set of brains, to take out the blood. Season with 
salt and pepper, and put in hot butter. When nearly done, 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 49 

break in a vessel six eggs, and turn in the frying-pan with 
the brains; cook a few minutes, stirring all the time. 

FRIED TRIPE. 

Cut in slices after being well boiled; dip each piece in 
thin batter, and fry in hot lard. It may be fried without 
batter; dredge with a little flour. Serve without gravy. In 
frying, lay the rough side down first. 

STEWED TRIPE. 

After the tripe is boiled tender, cut in small pieces an inch 
scpuare. Make a dressing of cream or milk, one table-spoon- 
ful of butter, pepper, and salt; dredge a little flour in it; one 
small onion chopped. Stir these all together ; put in the 
tripe one table-spoonful of curry-powder, and stew for twen- 
ty minutes. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

Cut three large-sized onions fine; take about half a loaf of 
bread, soak it in water, then squeeze the water from it. 
Put in a frying-pan two heaping table-spoonfuls of boiling 
lard; put the onion in, and when nearly done add the bread, 
and fry until perfectly brown. Season with two table-spoon- 
fuls of butter; red and black pepper and salt to taste; a little 
sage may be used. Then put in about thirty or forty oysters, 
after the water has been drained off. Salt and pepper your 
turkey; put it in a baking-pan; then stuff it with the above 
mixture; sprinkle a little flour over it, two table-spoonfuls of 
lard, and the water that has been drained from the oysters, 
with about a pint of water. Baste the turkey often, and 
cook brown. 

TO ROAST GOOSE. 

Pick, draw, and singe the goose well. Cut off its head 
and neck. Take off the feet and legs at the first joint; also, 
take off the wings at the first joint. Stuff with a dressing 
4 



50 GULF OITY COOK-BOOK. 

made of bread-crumbs, seasoned highly with sage, onion, 
pepper, salt, and butter. Cover the breast with buttered pa- 
per, to preserve it from scorching, and roast to a fine brown. 
It will require from two hours to two hours and a half in 
roasting. Baste it well with butter, and a little while before 
it is done remove the paper and allow the breast to brown. 
Serve with apple-sauce. 

WILD DUCKS 

Prepare your dressing as you would for any other fowl, 
with the addition of more onion. Dry the ducks, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and roll in flour. Take three or four 
whole onions, put all in a pan with hot lard; turn frequently, 
until brown; add water enough to cover the fowls. Cook 
until there is just enough liquor left for the gravy. 

CANVAS-BACK DUCKS. 

Have the ducks wiped dry, and stuffed as any other fowl. 
Rub over them lard, pepper, and salt, and roast about an 
hour. Make a gravy by stirring slowly in a sauce-pan the 
giblets of the ducks rolled in butter, flour, and as little water 
as possible. Before sending to the table a little lemon-juice 
squeezed over them is an improvement. 

MOCK DUCK. 

Take a flank steak, make a dressing, the same as for 
ducks, spread it on the steak, then roll and tie tight with a 
string, to keep the roll in shape; lay it in a pan with a little 
water and lard, sprinkled with pepper and salt. Bake in the 
oven of the stove. 

SALMIS OF COLD GAME, GOOSE, OR DUCK. 

Put into a sauce-pan a piece of butter rolled in flour ; let it 
molt, but not brown; add half a glass of broth, the same of 
red wine, two whole shallots, and a bunch of mixed herbs,— 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 51 

to be taken out before serving, — pepper and a little salt; boil 
together for half an hour. Cut up the game or duck warm, 
but do not boil it in this sauce, and add the juice of half a 
lemon. Garnish the bottom of the dish with fried slices of 
bread, and put the game upon it. Pour the sauce over it 
and serve. 

BIRD-PIE. 

Take about eight doves, and make a stuffing of bread and 
onions. Stuff each bird, then put into a stew-pan about a 
table-spoonful of lard, and a dessert-spoonful of flour; let it 
brown perfectly; cut a small onion very fine, and fry it, add- 
ing the birds, which should fry awhile before putting a pint 
of water over them, and let them boil until done. Take 
them out; add about two dozen oysters, with a little of the 
oyster- water, to the gravy, a table-spoonful of butter, salt, 
black pepper, allspice, and nutmeg; then line a baking-dish 
with pastry, put the birds in with the gravy, and cover it 
over with pastry and bake. 

SQUABS. 

Squabs are in the best condition to eat when fully feather- 
ed. Broil on hot coals, seasoned with melted butter, pepper, 
and salt. Serve on toast. A pie made of squabs, as you 
would make chicken-pie, is an excellent dish. 

BOILED CHICKEN. 

For boiling, choose a fat fowl. Fill the breast with force- 
meat or stuffing, and tie carefully round the body, or secure 
by sewing, which should be removed before sending to the 
table. Put it in hot water, and boil gently till done. Serve 
with drawn butter-sauce, in which three or four hard-boiled 
eggs have been chopped. This sauce can be made orna- 
mental by chopping one boiled beet fine, and mixing with it. 
Pour part of the sauce over the chicken, to garnish it, and 
put the remainder in a sauce-boat, to be served out as dished. 



52 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

CHICKEN POT-PIE. 

Cut up a chicken at the joints, — as for frying. Make a 
rich dough or crust ; place in the bottom of a pot, or large 
sauce-pan, a layer of the chicken, pepper, salt, bits of butter, 
and strips or squares of the dough; then place another layer 
of chicken, and over all put a crust of the dough in which an 
opening is left to pour a little water as the pie becomes too 
dry. Cover the pot closely, and cook about an hour and 
three quarters. 

CHICKEN-PIE WITH EGGS. 

To one chicken, six hard-boiled eggs, and one cup of but- 
ter. Cut the chicken as for frying; parboil in sufficient 
water, — in which you put a little salt, — to cook it tender. 
Line a baking-pan with puff-paste ; put in a layer of chicken, 
then a layer of the eggs, with bits of the butter; sprinkle 
well with black pepper and salt to your taste, then another 
layer of chicken, eggs, butter, and pepper, until all are in 
the pan ; cover the whole with the water in which the 
chicken was boiled ; add a top crust and bake. 

BROILED CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken open in the back, and lay it in salt-water 
for an hour, to extract all the blood ; then wipe quite dry with 
a napkin or towel, and lay on a hot gridiron, over clear 
coals. Have in a pan some melted butter and pepper, with 
which to baste while broiling. . Brown the chicken on both 
sides, and when dished pour over it the remainder of the 
melted butter. Only young and tender chickens should be 
used for broiling. 

TO COOK AN OLD CHICKEN. 

Wash carefully and fill with buttered bread-crumbs, sea- 
soned with pepper, salt, and thyme; put in a pot with a 
tight-fitting cover, with about a pint of water ; turn often, and 
cook two hours, or until tender. 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 53 

TO FRY CHICKEN. 

Beat two eggs, to which add a little milk ; pepper and salt 
your chicken, dip it in the eggs and milk; then roll in pow- 
dered crackers, and fry in lard or butter until brown. 

CHICKEN N A LA MANGE. 

Cut a raw chicken into two parts. Put half a tea-cup of 
sweet-oil in a sauce-pan; let it get hot; put your chicken in, 
and fry it brown on both sides; add a small onion, or a quar- 
ter of garlic, chopped with parsley, to suit the taste; dredge 
with flour, and fill the sauce-pan with water, so as to cover 
the chicken. Cover it very close, and stew inside the stove 
until done. Fry a dozen eggs on both sides, and serve with 
the chicken. 

CHICKEN FRICASSEE. 

Prepare a chicken; cut it into small pieces, put them into 
a sauce-pan, with half an onion, a small piece of mace, salt 
and pepper to taste, root celery ; let all boil slowly until the 
chicken is tender and cooked, without falling to pieces, the 
water simmered away. Just before serving, beat up the 
yelks of two eggs; pour to them the broth of the chicken, 
hot, and stirring well; pour it back upon the chicken, but do 
not let it boil, or it will curdle. 

FRICASSEE CHICKEN WITH APPLE. 

Dress and disjoint a fowl. Place it in a deep kettle, with 
sufficient water to cover it, and a little salt. When quite 
tender pour off the liquor and brown nicely in salt pork fat. 
Thicken the gravy and season with pepper. To one good- 
sized chicken take eight tart apples, wipe, halve, and take 
out the cores. Set them over the chicken, skin side down, 
then pour on the gravy, cover tightly, and let them cook 
ten minutes, or till tender. Serve the apple upon a sep- 
arate dish, and eat as sauce. If the gravy needs butter, add 



54 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

it after the apple is taken out. Young turkeys are nice pre- 
pared in this way. 

. POUL^ET ^A LA MARANGE. 

Fry the chicken in lard, brown as for gumbo, with onion. 
Of course, the chicken must be cut. When well done put it 
in a stew-pan and cover it with water. Let it simmer slow- 
ly j season with pepper, salt, butter, and a box of mushrooms. 
Garnish the dish with toast and eggs fried on both sides ; or 
if you prefer, you may use pastry-cakes. A little wine, red 
or white, a few olives, with seed taken out. Some pickle and 
parsley is nice to garnish the dish. Very nice made of cold 
turkey. 

A NICE WAY TO COOK CHICKEN. 

Prepare a nice frying-size chicken ; season with salt and 
pepper; fry in batter a nice brown. Lay on a dish in which 
you are going to serve. Make a sauce of five or six large 
tomatoes, chopped, a small onion, a little cream, pepper and 
salt, stewed for five or ten minutes. Pour over the chicken, 
and serve hot. 

CHICKEN V A LA BRUNSWICK. 

Take two fat young chickens; cut them up, not too fine. 
Put into a good-sized sauce-pan one table-spoonful of lard, one 
of butter ; brown two table-spoonfuls of sifted flour into the 
lard and butter, with an onion chopped fine. Salt and pep- 
per your chicken to taste. Slice three or four pieces of salt 
pork or fat from a ham; fry it with the lard, butter, flour, and 
onion. Have ready, peeled and cut fine, one quart of new 
Irish potatoes, one quart of tomatoes, one of Lima beans, one 
of green peas, one of green corn, and a glass of good claret 
wine. First, bi*own the flour, then add the onion, then the 
chicken, then the vegetables, with just enough boiling water 
to cover the ingredients; let it boil until done. Just before 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 55 

taking up add the wine: let it stay about ten minutes. Stir 
well, and serve hot, 

JELLIED CHICKEN. 

Take one large chicken, or two small ones; boil them in a 
quart of water until tender. Cut off the meat, put the skin 
and bones back into the liquor and boil it down to a pint of 
jelly — about three quarters of an hour. Chop up the meat 
of the chicken and pound it fine; add to it a tea-spoonful of 
powdered mustard, one of salt, one of butter, a little pepper, 
and half a tea-cupful of the liquid jelly, from which you must 
strain the bones and skin; the remainder of the liquid jelly 
pour into the bottom and let it cool. Put the pounded 
chicken in a sauce-pan, and warm it, so that all the ingredi- 
ents may be thoroughly mixed; then let it cool, and spread 
it on the top of the jelly, in the mold. Set the mold in a 
cool place. When wanted to use, set the mold, for an in- 
stant, in hot water, and turn out like blanc-mange' . 

TURKEY GELATINE. 

Chop fine and separately the meat of a cold turkey, some 
sliced ham, four hard-boiled eggs, and some mustard pickles, 
and put them in a mold in alternate layers. Place the rem- 
nants and bones in a stew-pan, with some thyme, mace, pep- 
per, half an ounce of isinglass, and enough water to cover, 
and allow it to boil gently and thoroughly. When done, 
strain it through a sieve and pour on the chicken in the 
mold. Turn out when cold. Chicken may be used instead 
of turkey, if desired. 

BRUNSWICK STEW. 

At ten o'clock put on two slices of fat bacon, and one onion 
cut fine, and boil one hour. Then put on two quarts of to- 
matoes, skimmed, or mashed well, and boil one hour; then put 
in a large pod of red pepper, and two chickens, cut as for 



56 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



frying, and stew until two o'clock; then put in one cup of 
butter, and stale bread-crumbs for gravy. Add two ears of 
corn, first boiled and cut from the cobs, some Irish potatoes, 
mashed; salt to taste, and serve hot. A squirrel could be 
used instead of chicken. 

"TO COOK A CHICKEN LIKE TARRAPIN." 

Boil a fine, fat, young chicken; when done and warm, cut 
all the meat from the bones, in small pieces, as for chicken- 
salad. Put into a stew-pan with one gill of boiling water; 
then stir together, until perfectly smooth, one quarter of a 
pound of butter, one tea- spoonful of flour, and the yelk of a 
hard-boiled egg. Add to the chicken half the mixture at a 
time ; pepper and salt to taste. After letting it simmer ten 
minutes, add a wine-glass of sherry or Madeira. Add spice 
and mushroom; catchup to taste. 

PILLAU. 

Boil one pint of rice in as much water as will cover it. 
When boiled, put in a chicken with one onion, a blade of 
mace, some whole pepper, and salt. When it is boiled suf- 
ficiently put the fowl in a dish, and pour the rice in it. A 
small piece of bacon boiled with the rice, and then taken 
out, adds to the flavor. Boil several eggs hard, and slice 
over the chicken. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES. 

The lean of chicken, free from skin, minced finely with a 
little ham and stale broad-crumbs. The proportions will be 
six table-spoonfuls of meat, two of bread-crumbs, very fine, a 
shade of nutmeg, pepper, half a tea-spoonful of onions, a tea- 
spoonful of minced parsley; put all on with half a pint of 
stock — your sou]) for dinner will answer. When it comes to 
a boil mix a couple of eggs, well beaten, and some cream, 
and stew until it thickens. Spread it out on a dish to cool ; 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 57 

shape like an egg. Roll in crumbs, and throw them into 
very hot lard, and fry quickly. Serve on a napkin with 
parsley. Brains stewed with the above is a great improve- 
ment. Veal croquettes are made in the same way. 

TO MAKE CROQUETTES. 
Take cold chicken or veal, with slices of ham, fat and lean ; 
chop them together very fine, and add a set of brains, mashed 
very fine also. Mix with stale bread, grated and seasoned to 
your taste ; knead all well together, until it resembles sausage- 
meat. Make up in little balls; dip them in the yelks of eggs 
beaten; cover them quickly with grated bread, and fry them 
a light brown. 

JAM BOLAYA. 

Have the lard hot, put in flour, cook to a light brown, 
with a medium-sized onion. Take the giblets, neck, small 
part of the wings and feet of your chicken, and put in the 
lard; add half a tea-cup of prepared tomatoes, two dozen 
oysters, with their liquor, pepper and salt to taste; put in 
nearly a pint of rice, one table-spoonful of butter; stir fre- 
quently when nearly done ; set back on the stove and let 
steam. 

VENISON V A LA MODE. 

Remove the bone from the haunch, and make a large 
quantity of force-meat, or stuffing of bread-crumbs, bits of 
pork, an onion minced fine, a small piece of celery, or celery, 
seed, parsley, and sage. Season with pepper and salt to 
taste. Press in the stuffing till the hole left by the bone is 
filled. Sew up the opening and spread over it nice lard; 
pepper and salt to taste. Cook well done; take out the 
meat, stir in a dessert-spoonful of flour, a wine-glass of wine; 
let it boil up once, and serve in a sauce-bowl. 
HAUNCH OF VENISON. 

A good haunch of venison will take three or four hours to 



58 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

roast. It being a dry meat it would be well to cover it with 
a paste made of flour and water, until nearly done; cover 
this with a thick piece of paper, tied on. Baste the paper 
well with butter, to keep it from catching on fire. When 
this is removed baste well with the drippings seasoned with 
salt, pepper, and a little browned flour sprinkled over. But- 
ter or lard may be necessary to afford sufficient gravy. 
This meat should be accompanied with a tart jelly. 

VENISON STEAKS. 

Cut the steaks about an inch thick, sprinkle with flour, fry 
in hot lard or butter. Season with salt and pepper when 
half done; turn frequently. Take out the steak when done, 
stir a little flour in the pan, and pour enough hot water on 
to make sufficient gravy. Let it boil up; then pour in a 
wine-glassful of wine, and pour over the steak. 

ANOTHER WAY TO COOK VENISON STEAKS. 

Put it in a well-covered pun, and heat it thoroughly with- 
out water. Take it out, and when cool enough to handle 
press it, so as to extract all the juice. Mix with the juice a 
table-spoonful of butter, pepper, salt, a little mustard, vine- 
gar, and walnut catchup, and put on the stove until they are 
well mixed. Eeturn the steak to the covered pan, and pour 
the gravy over it and cook gently till done. It will not take 
much time, as the meat is partially cooked. This method is 
equally good for beefsteak. 

BARBECUE. 

To barbecue any kind of meat is simply to broil it. When 
you wish to cook a whole mutton, or any other animal, have 
a large pit dug in the ground, and several hours before cook- 
ing make a good fire of oak-wood, and let it burn to a bed of 
coals. Place over the top of this pit strips of dry wood, upon 
which you place your meat. Make a sauce of butter, vine- 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 59 

gar, mustard, salt, pepper, catchup, and baste the meat fre- 
quently; use a stick with a piece of cloth tied on the end, to 
baste with. To cook meat in this way requires constant at- 
tention. Turn the meat often. A smaller piece of meat can 
be cooked in the same manner, on a gridiron, over hot coals. 

SQUIRREL STEWED. 

Skin them very carefully, \o as not to allow the hair to 
touch the flesh ; this can be done by cutting a slit under the 
throat, and as you pull it off, turn the skin over, so as to in- 
close the hair. Cut the squirrel in pieces (discard the head), 
and lay them in cold water; put a large table-spoonful of lard 
in a stew-pan, with an onion sliced, and a table-spoonful of 
flour; let fry until the flour is brown, then put in a pint of 
water, the squirrel seasoned with salt and pepper, and cook 
until tender. When half done put in some strips of nice 
puff-paste and a little butter. 

SQUIRREL BROILED. 

Broil over hot coals, and baste frequently with melted but- 
ter, pepper, salt, and a little vinegar. Rabbits should be 
prepared in the same manner as squirrels. 

TO COOK FROGS. 

Put the hind legs in salt and water over night. Wipe 
them dry with a cloth; sprinkle a little flour over them, and 
fry in hot lard to a light brown; or, they can be rolled in egg 
and cracker-dust before frying. 

FROGS STEWED. . 

Skin, boil five minutes, throw into cold water, and drain as 
above. Put in a stew-pan two ounces of butter, for two dozen 
frogs; set it on the fire, and when melted lay the legs in ; 
fry two minutes, tossing now and then; then sprinkle on 
them a tea-spoonful of flour; stir with a wooden spoon ; add 



60 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

two sprigs of parsley, one of thyme, a bay- leaf, two cloves, 
one of garlic, salt, white pepper, and half a pint of white 
wine; boil gen tl} 7 till done, dish the legs, reduce the sance 
on the fire, strain it, mix in it the yelks of two eggs; pour 
on the le°;s and serve them.

EGGS. 



BOILED EGGS. 

Put eggs into boiling water. If you wish the whites set, 
boil two minutes; if you wish the yelks set, boil three min- 
utes; if for a salad it will require ten minutes. 

TO POACH EGGS. 

Break into a vessel of boiling water as many eggs as will 
cover the bottom; best not to touch. Let them cook until 
the whites are set. Take up with a perforated skimmer, 
pour melted butter over them, and dust with pepper and 
salt. They are nice served on toast. 

TO SCRAMBLE EGGS. 

Break the eggs into a bowl, and stir in salt and pepper. 
Put a good piece of butter in a frying-pan, and when it is 
hot pour in the eggs, stirring all the time ; a few minutes 
will be sufficient. Grated ham is an improvement. 

EGG-TOAST. 

Boil one tea-cup of milk, thickened with a little flour or 
corn-starch, and one table-spoonful of butter; stir in your 
eggs that have been seasoned with salt and pepper, cook un- 
til the whites are set. Pour over buttered toast while hot 

OMELET. 

Beat six eggs very light — the whites to a stiff froth, the 
yelks to a smooth batter. Add to the yelks a small cup of 



62 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

milk, pepper, and salt; lastly, stir in the whites lightly. 
Have ready in a hot frying-pan a good lump of butter; when 
it hisses pour in the mixture gently and set over a clear 
fire. It should cook in ten minutes. To be eaten as soon 
as cooked, as it will fall. 

SHIRRED EGGS. 

Take as many saucers or small earthen plates as are re- 
quired for each person. Break into each two eggs, being 
careful not to break the yelks, and place in a well-heated 
stove to bake, the whites only to be done, the yelks half 
done. They are to be eaten out of the saucers, and sea- 
soned to taste at the table. 

FRIED EGGS. 

Break the eggs in hot lard with a little salt and pepper. 
It is best to break the eggs in a saucer before putting in the 
frying-pan, as some may not be good. Do not turn them 
over. Serve with fried ham. 

BAKED EGGS. 

Boil one dozen eggs until perfectly hard, then put in cold 
water; shell, and divide the egg in half, remove the yelk 
and mash up smooth, add a few bread-crumbs, season with 
butter, pepper, and salt. Fill the whites of eggs with this 
dressing; grate a cracker over the top, and bake to a light 
brown. 

STUFFED EGGS. 

Boil the eggs hard ; put in cold water. Cut out the small 
end of the eggs, take out the yelks, put in a bowl, and mash 
well, with. a small onion and a little celery chopped fine, four 
spoonfuls of cream, black pepper and salt to taste, and .one 
table-spoonful of butter; stuff the whites with the mixture 
and bake in a quick oven. 



EGGS. 63 

OMELET SOUFFLE'. 

Half a cup of sugar, half a cup of butter, one cup of flour, 
one pint of milk; mix well together, set it on the fire and 
stir until it thickens, then add the yelks of five eggs, well 
beaten, and set aside to cool. Beat the whites of the -eggs 
to a stiff froth, mix well in the above. Put in a pudding- 
dish well buttered, and bake in a tolerably hot oven. Eat 
warm, with or without sauce. 

OMELET WITH HAM. 

Six eggs beaten separately, season with pepper and salt ; 
add grated ham, and fry in small cakes in boiling butter. 

PICKLED EGGS. 

Scald one quart of vinegar, with a half dozen cloves, one 
dozen allspice, one tea-spoonful of pepper, one table -spoonful 
of flour of mustard. Pour this over one dozen hard-boiled 
eggs that have been shelled and placed in a jar. When eggs 
are boiled hard and are intended to be used when cold, they 
should be thrown immediately into cold water, to keep them 
from becoming discolored. 

EGG-BALLS FOR SOUP. 

Kub the yelks of three or four hard-boiled eggs to a smooth 
paste, with a very little butter and salt; add to these two 
raw ones, beaten light, and enough flour to hold the paste 
together. Make into balls, with floured hands, and set in a 
cool place until just before your soup is taken off, when put 
in carefully and boil one minute. 

EGGS A LA CR^EME 

Hard-boil twelve eggs ; slice them in thin rings ; have ready 
a plateful of grated bread-crumbs. In the bottom of a large 
baking-dish place a layer of the crumbs, then one of the 
eggs; cover with bits of butter, and sprinkle with pepper and 
salt. Continue thus to blend these ingredients until the 



64 GUL* CITY COOK-BOOK. 

dish is full, having the crumbs on the top. Over the whole 
pour a large tea-cupful of cream, and brown nicely in a 
moderately heated oven. • 

TO TEST EGGS. 

Put them in water; if the large end turns up they are not 
fresh. You can depend on any egg that will lay on the 
side in water and not float. 

FRIED EGG-TOAST, OR DUTCH TOAST. 

Slice bread, and butter it; beat five or six eggs very light, 
and dip into them each slice of bread, and fry in hot butter; 
pepper and salt to the taste just as you take from the fire. 
Serve hot.

come to a boil; then stir in quickly two eggs, beaten well, the 
whites and yelks beaten separately, and very light; take off 
immediately. Serve when cold. 

SALMON SALAD. 

If the salmon salad is made of the fish preserved in cans, 
drain it from the oil, and mince the meat fine; cut up one 
third as much lettuce or celery. For one box of salmon boil 
four eggs hard, lay them in cold water a few minutes, shell 
and separate the whites and yelks, and lay the whites aside. 
Mash the yelks smooth with two table-spoonfuls of sweet 
olive-oil or one tea-cupful of sweet milk or cream; add one 
tea-cupful of vinegar, one table-spoonful of sugar, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, two or more tea-spoonfuls of fine mustard,

tea-cupful of good vinegar, nearly as much celery as oysters ; 
cut up very fine, drain the liquor from the oysters and throw 
them into hot vinegar, on the fire; let them remain until 
they are plump, but not cooked. Then put them at once 
into clear cold water. This gives them a nice, plump look ; and 
they will not then shrink and look small. Drain the water 
from them and set them in a cool place ; mash the yelks very 
fine, rub into it the salt, pepper, and mustard, then the oil, a 
fe>v drops at a time. When smooth add the beaten eggs 
and then the vinegar, a spoonful at a time. Mix oysters, 
celery, and pickle; sprinkle in salt to taste; then pour dress-

Cream the yeiKs of four eggs in a table-spoonful of vine- 
gar; salt and pepper to taste. Add half a pound of butter, 
and place on the fire till it thickens; do not let it get too 
hot, or it will curdle. » 

SAUCE FOR FISH. 

Take the yelks of six hard-boiled eggs and cream them 
with sweet-oil, mustard, walnut catchup, Worcestershire 
sauce, salt, pepper, and vinegar to taste. Pickle chopped 
fine improves it. 

TARTAR-SAUCE. (For Boiled or Baked Fish.) 

Put into a small sauce-pan the yelks of two eggs, a des. 
sert-spoonful of vinegar, and a pinch of salt; whip up this 
mixture as quick as possible ; when the whole forms a sort 
of cream add two dessertspoonfuls of oil and a tea-spoonful 
of mustard, which must be well mixed previously, a pinch of 
parsley minced fine, and a little cayenne pepper. The oil

should be put in drop by drop, to mix perfectly. Heat thor- 
oughly, not boil. 

SAUCE PIQUANT. (For Fried Fish.) 

Take three table-spoonfuls of sweet-oil, one of vinegar, one 
tea-spoonful of mixed mustard, some fine salt, some onion 
minced fine, chopped pai*sley, bright red pepper-pods cut up 
into small pieces. All these ingredients should be beaten 
well together and poured over the fish as it comes hot out 
of the frying-pan. 

MAYONNAISE. 

Place in the bottom of a salad-bowl the yelk of one raw 
egg, a tea-spoonful of salt, the same of dry mustard, a salt- 
spoonful of white pepper, as much red pepper as can be taken 
on the point of a pen-knife, and the juice of half a lemon ; 
mix these ingredients with a wooden salad-spoon, until they 
assume a creamy-white appearance; then add, drop by drop, 
three gills of salad-oil, stirring the mayonnaise constantly; 
if it thickens too rapidly, thin with the juice from the second 
half of the lemon. Add gradually four table-spoonfuls of 
tarragon vinegar. Two spoonfuls of cream is an improve- 
ment. Keep cool until wanted for use. 

VENISON-SAUCE. 

One pint of currant jelly, three fourths of a pound of but- 
ter, four table -spoonfuls of brown sugar, one table-spoonful 
of ground mace and allspice, and one pint of wine. Boil till 
it thickens.

fuls of brown sugar, half pint of vinegar, and a salt-spoonful 
of salt; stir well until the sugar is dissolved. Do not heat. 

CRANBERRY-SAUCE. 
To a quart of ripe cranberries add half a pint of water, 



SALADS. 73 

stirring frequently; when soft, mash well; when done, stir in 
a pound of sugar ; let it boil up once, as much cooking 
after the sugar is put in will cause the sauce to- be dark ; 
pass through a sieve. Makes a beautiful jelly when cold. 

MUSHROOM-SAUCE. 

Take a pint of mushrooms; remove the outside skins if 
fresh, if canned they are ready for use; stew them slowly in 
milk or cream, seasoning with pepper, salt, and a spoonful 
of butter rolled in flour; stew them until they are tender, 
stirring them with a silver spoon. This sauce served with 
beefsteak or chicken boiled is very good. 

CAPER-SAUCE. 

Melt a quarter of a pound of butter with a table-spoonful 
of flour; add a pint of sweet milk, let it come to a boil ; sea- 
son with salt and pepper, then add a tea-cup of capers, and 
four eggs boiled hard and minced fine. Cucumber pickles 
well minced, make a nice substitute. This is a nice sauce 
fbr boiled meats. 

ONION-SAUCE.— No. i. 

Put six sliced onions in a sauce-pan, with three table- 
spoonfuls of butter, one tea-spoonful of salt, same of sugar, 
and half a tea-spoonful of ground pepper; cook slowly till it 
thickens to a pulp, stirring constantly; then add one pint of 
milk, thickened with one table-spoonful of flour. Boil till 
about as thick as drawn butter. Strain through a coarse 
sieve and serve. 

ONION-SAUCE.— No. 2. 

Slice one onion, fry slightly in two table-spoonfuls of but- 
ter, in which one tea-spoonful of flour has been stirred ; pour 
into this one tea-cupful of sweet milk and a little chopped 
parsley; cook a few minutes; pour over three hard-boiled 
eggs, minced fine. A very nice sauce for fish or boiled 
meats. 



74 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

CELERY-SAUCE. 

Cut two heads of celery into small pieces; put them into a 
pint of water, boil until tender, then add one half tumbler of 
cream, salt, pepper, and a small lump of butter rolled in 
flour; let the whole stew gently five minutes. To be eaten 
with boiled fowls. 

TOMATO-SAUCE. 

Remove the skin by pouring boiling water over them, chop 
them up and put them in a stew-pan, cook thoroughly, strain 
through a sieve, add a heaping table-spoonful of butter, pep- 
per, and salt to taste, and half a tea-spoonful of allspice; put 
it in the stew-pan and let cook slowly till it thickens. Use 
sugar instead of pepper, if preferred. 

HORSE-RADISH SAUCE. 

Mix together one dessert-spoonful of mustard, two table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, and three table-spoonfuls of cream; 
season with salt and grated horse-radish to suit the taste. 

CURRY-POWDER. 

Pound fine and mix three ounces of coriander seeds, three 
of tui*meric, one of vinegar, one of black pepper, one of mus- 
tard, one quarter of an ounce of cinnamon, the same of cay- 
enne pepper, and cumin-seed. Keep this powder in a bottle 
with a glass stopper. 

TO MELT BUTTER. 

Take four ounces of good butter ; rub into it one table- 
spoonful of flour, one table-spoonful of water, a little salt; set 
the vessel in another of boiling water; shake it until the but- 
ter begins to boil. Do not place the pan containing the but- 
ter on the fire, as it is easily reduced to oil, and will be much 
impaired. This ma}' be seasoned with any kind of herbs; a 
litttle more water is needed when herbs are used. Take 
parsley, boil for a few minutes, drain off the water, mince 



SALADS. 75 

fine, and stir in the butter when it begins to draw. This 
sauce is fine for all boiled meats and fowl. 

DRAWN BUTTER. 

Take half a pint of boiling water, two tea-spoonfuls of 
flour, two ounces of butter; mix flour and butter till smooth; 
stir into the hot water and salt to taste. 

EGG-SAUCE. 

Make like drawn butter, with the addition of three eggs, 
boiled hard and chopped fine. Serve this with fish. 

BROWNING SUGAR.— (For Soups and Sauces.) 

Take half a pound of sugar, and put just water enough to 
wet it; pour in a vessel and simmer slowly, stirring all the 
time, until it is a light-brown color; add one ounce of salt 
and water to the consistency of sirup, boil a few minutes, 
taking off the scum. Keep in a bottle. Before putting in 
the soup or sauce stir in the quantity you intend using in a 
cup of the broth.

ASPARAGUS. 

Tie in bunches of about twenty-five each, and evenly as 
possible ; throw in warm, salted water, and boil quickly for 
twenty minutes. When done, take up with a skimmer and 
lay on buttered toast. Serve with drawn butter or cream 
sauce. 

burr Artichokes. 

The burr should be boiled in hot water, with a little salt, 
until tender, which you can ascertain by pulling out a leaf; 
if it leaves the burr easily, it is done. To be eaten with 
melted butter or oil, pepper, and vinegar 

STRING BEANS. 

String the beans by breaking off the ends and pulling the 
fibrous thread on each side. If old, it is best to break them 
in two, besides stringing. As they are strung, throw them 
into cold water until ready to be cooked. Put them in boil- 
ing water, with a little salt, and cook till tender, which will 
take about an hour. Drain them, and season with butter, 
pepper, and cream; return to the sauce-pan and cook a min- 
ute. 

Another way to cook beans is to boil with a small piece of 
salt pork. The meat should be half done before putting in 
the beans, and also skim while cooking. 



VEGETABLES. 77 



LIMA OR BUTTER BEANS. 

Shell and wash them in cold water; put in enough boil- 
ing water tq cover them, with a little salt; boil for half an 
hour; pour off the water, and season with butter and pepper. 
If they are a little old, add a small pinch of bi-carbonate of 
soda. 

TO BAKE DRY BEANS. 

Soak them over night in cold water; put them to boil in 
enough of cold water to cover them well ; let th.em boil two 
hours. Drain off the water, season with salt and pepper, 
and put in a dish to bake ; place in the center of the beans 
a tsmall piece of salt pork that has been boiled in another 
vessel, and bake half an hour. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS. 

Soak in water a short time, and wash it clean; boil in salt- 
water. When done, strain and fry in a table-spoonful of 
butter, in which has been browned a table-spoonful of flour, 
and a small onion cut fine; add pepper and salt to taste. 

BEETS. 

Wash them well ; be careful not to cut the top too close to 
the beet, or break off the ends, as this will allow both the 
color and sweetness to escape ; boil one hour. When done, 
drop in cold water and rub off the skin, and slice very thin. 
Dress with melted butter or salad-oil, pepper, and salt; serve 
hot. They are more commonly dressed in vinegar, salt, and 
pepper, when cold. Old beets will take two hours to boil. 

CABBAGE. 

This vegetable, when properly cooked, will not disagree with 
the most delicate stomach. An eminent physician taught me 
how to have it prepared. It is simply to change the water 
two or three times while cooking; but be sure to have the 



78 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

water well drained each time, and a kettle of boiling water 
at hand to replace that which has been thrown off. Change 
the first water about half an hour after boiling, and so on as 
many times as you wish. Put the meat into the last water. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Quarter a large cabbage, and lay in enough cold water to 
cover it for two or three hours; then have enough boiling 
water to well cover the cabbage, and plunge it in. One 
hour's cooking is sufficient. Put in a little salt before taking 
up, and serve with drawn butter. 

CABBAGE ^ETOUFE'. 

Take a white-head cabbage; make two incisions across the 
head deep enough to cleanse it; wash it clean ; then shake 
the water from it ; strew between each leaf nice sausage- 
meat, and tie up with strips of white cloth, to keep it in 
shape. Have ready a very large spoonful of lard in a pot 
large enough to contain the cabbage ; brown some flour, and 
when boiling' put in the cabbage; cover closely. After 
twenty minutes withdraw the potto a more gentle heat; sim- 
mer for two hours; salt and pepper to taste; serve whole. 

STUFFED CABBAGE. 
I 
Take a good-sized, very hard head of cabbage, lay back 

half a dozen of the outside leaves, and cut a square out of 
the center of the cabbage; put back this square, and tie the 
leaves firmly around it; then plunge the cabbage in boil- 
ing, salted water; let it boil till quite done, and remove 
from the water. Make a stuffing as for turkey; take out the 
square from the cabbage, and chop with this dressing. Fill 
the cabbage and place in a pot, with one pint of cream or 
rich milk and two table spoonfuls of butter. Let all simmer 
till most of the milk is absorbed.

HOT DRESSING FOR CABBAGE COOKED WITHOUT MEAT. 

Beat together the yelks of two eggs, two table-spoonfuls 
of brown sugar, four table-spoonfuls of vinegar, a large ta- 
ble-spoonful of butter, and pepper and salt to taste. Stir well 
in a sauce-pan till it boils ; then add a cup of milk.or cream. 
Pour hot over the cabbage, and serve. 

CORN-PATTIES. 

Take six ears of boiled corn ; cut off from the cob by di- 
viding the grains and scraping after cutting; season with 
pepper and salt. Mix with the yelks of four eggs well beaten, 
two table-spoonfuls of flour; whisk the whites to a stiff froth, 
and stir in lastly. Drop one table-spoonful at a time in hot 
lard, and fry a light brown on both sides. 

FRIED CORN. 

Cut the corn from the cobs, and put in a frying-pan with 
one half tumbler of water to a quart; let it stew a short time, 
as it will be more tender; then stir in pepper and salt and a 
table-spoonful of lard, and fry a very light brown. 

GREEN-CORN PUDDING. 

Take twelve ears of green corn and grate it; add a quart 
of sweet milk, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, four eggs 
well beaten, pepper and, salt to the taste. Stir all well to- 
gether and bake one hour in a buttered dish. 

SUCCOTASH. 

Boil the corn and beans in separate pots until done ; then 
cut and scrape the corn from the cob, and to every measure 
of beans allow two of corn; mix them; season with milk, 
butter, pepper, and salt. Boil up once, and serve 

GREEN-CORN PUDDING, WITH CHICKEN. 

Boil six large ears of corn ; slice the grains off, commenc- 
ing with a very thin coat of the outer grains. Boil a spring 



80 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

cbicken until quite tender; salt, pepper, and flour each piece 
of the chicken. Beat four eggs with a small cup of butter, a 
spoonful of pepper and salt; add to the corn, making a thick 
batter with the top of the chicken- water; place the batter in 
a large, buttered baking-dish ; lay the floured pieces of chick- 
en carefully down into the batter; sift a little flour over the 
top of the batter, but not on the sides of the dish. Bake it 
uTitil the bottom, sides, and top are a light brown. 

CARROTS. 

Carrots should be boiled in salt-water until they can be 
pierced by a straw. The water should then be poured off, and 
the carrots stewed a few minutes in melted butter and cream. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

Wash it clean ; peel the stem, wrap it in muslin, and boil 
in salt-water one hour,; make butter or egg sauce. Egg 
Sauce. — Beat two table-spoonfuls of butter until it foams; 
stir with it the yelks of four eggs; add half a table-spoonful 
of flour, and stir it while boiling in some of the liquor of the 
cauliflower. 

CAULIFLOWER OMELET. 

Take the white part of a boiled cauliflower, after it is cold, 
and chop it very small; mix with a sufficient quantity of 
well-beaten egg, to make a very thick batter; then fry it in 
fresh butter, and serve hot. 

EGG-PLANT FRIED. 

Boil in water until perfectly done, first" peeling it ; mash 
well, and stir into it when cool one egg, one table-spoonful 
of butter, one table-spoonful of flour to one plant; season 
with salt, pepper, and onion cut fine, if desired; fry in cakes. 
The batter should be soft enough to drop with a spoon. 



VEGETABLES. 81 



ANOTHER WAY. 

Peel the egg-plant ; parboil ten minutes ; cut in slices cross- 
wise; season with salt and pepper. Beat up one egg; dip the 
slices in the Qgg, then in cracker crumbs. Fry a light brown 
in boiling lard. Egg-plants prepared in this way, and fried 
in batter, are equally nice. 

BAKED EGG-PLANT. 

Cut the egg-plant lengthwise; take out the inside, and 
mix it with nearly as much bread-crumbs, one egg, pepper, 
and salt; fry the mixture in hot butter; return to the shells, 
and bake half an hour. 

GRITS. 

Pick over and wash nicely ; allow twice as much water as 
grits; season with salt, and boil till done. Cold grits can be 
nicely utilized by slicing, and dipping the slices in a beaten 
egg in which there is mixed a little flour, and fry in hot lard. 

Another. — Soften the cold grits with warm water. Mix 
with eggs, a little butter,' salt, and milk, and bake in a but- 
tered dish. 

HOMINY. 

Wash thoroughly through two or three waters, and boil 
three or four hours, allowing twice the quantity of water to 
that of hominy. Just before it is done, season with salt' 
Place a small lump of butter in a deep dish, and pour the 
hominy over it. 

MUSHROOMS. 

Cut off the stems, peel off the skins, and put in a stew-pan, 
with a little salt and water; cook about half an hour; add 
butter, pepper, and thicken with a little flour. Boil five min 
utes, and serve on toast or over steak. It is safest to stir 
with a silver spoon, as any toad-stools, which are poisonous, 
will turn the spoon dark.

82 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

BROILED MUSHROOMS. 

Wash, stem, and peel off the skins of the mushrooms; put 
them on the gridiron over hot coals, with the hollow side up; 
sprinkle a little pepper, salt, and butter on each one; cook a 
few minutes, but do not turn. 

STEWEO OKRA. 

Wash the okra in cold water, and cut it in thin slices cross- 
wise. To one pint of cut okra cut up one small onion, one 
table spoonful of flour, and fry in a frying-pan in which some 
slices of pork have been fried, or a large table-spoonful of 
lard. Scald and peel six tomatoes, and stir in the mixture. 
Cook until all are done. 

TO BOIL OKRA. 

Okra should be young and tender. Cut off the stems and 
the tip of the small end ; boil till tender, but not long enough 
to cause it to fall to pieces ; pour over melted butter, seasoned 
with salt and pepper. 

FRIED OKRA. 

Boil the okra in salt-water until tender; mash it up, and 
stir in one egg, pepper, salt, and flour enough to hold to- 
gether. Take up a large spoonful, and fry in hot lard. 

ONIONS. 

Onions boiled in milk, instead of water, are rendered more 
delicate and improved in flavor. Lot the milk boil ; add a 
little salt. Peel the onions, and put them in the boiling milk, 
and let them boil half an hour, or until well done. Drain 
them in a colander ; put them in a warm dish, and pour a 
little melted butter over them; sprinkle with black pepper. 

STEWED ONIONS. 

Slice your onions; have ready in your frying-pan a table- 
spoonful of lard. When it is hot, put in the onions ; let them 



VEGETABLES. 83 

fry a few minutes; pour in about half a cup of hot water or 
milk; sift over the top about a tablespoonful of flour; cover 
closely, and let it stew gently until the onions are done. Sea- 
son with pepper and salt. 

ONION OMELET. 

Six large onions boiled quite done; mash, and season with 
pepper, salt, one table-spoonful of butter, one half cup of 
sweet milk, and one egg. Bake five minutes. 

FRIED ONIONS. 

Peel and slice the onions ; season with pepper and salt to 
taste ; fry in boiling lard to a light brown. 

ONION PUDDING. 

One and a half cups of chopped onions, one cup of sweet 
milk, one slice oft light bread, two eggs, one large spoonful 
of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Bake in a pudding-dish. 
Cabbage pudding in the same proportions, substituting cab- 
bage for onions. 

PARSNIPS. 

Wash and scrape them; cut in halves or quarters, accord- 
ing to the size; boil them until tender, — about half an 
hour. Season with butter, salt, and pepper. 

PARSNIP FRITTERS. 

Boil the parsnips until tender; mash and pass them through 
a colander; stir in one well-beaten egg and enough flour to 
make it hold together. Season, and fry in hot lard. 

FRIED PARSNIPS. 

Boil until tender; slice them lengthwise; dip in batter, and 
fry brown in hot lard. 

PLANTAINS. 
Cut your plantains lengthwise, and put them in a pan; 



84 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

cover with sugar, and let them stand for several hours, so 
that they will absorb the sugar. Fry in a spoonful of butter. 

POTATOES. 

The best way to cook Irish potatoes is to put them in just 
enough boiling water to cover them, leaving the skins on. 
Let them boil steadily till done. When nearly done, put in 
a little salt; remove the skins while hot, and just as you are 
going to send to the table, pour over melted butter. A very 
poor potato cooked in this way, and pressed, while hot, in a 
coarse cloth, will be mealy ; and if mashed with a little butter, 
cream, or milk, you can not tell it from the best. Potatoes 
should not be served in a covered dish, as the condensing of 
the steam makes them clammy. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Tare the potatoes very thin, as the best of the potato is 
near the skin ; put in sufficient boiling water, salted, to cover 
them. When done, pour off the water, allowing them a lit- 
tle hard, and set back on the stove to dry, with the cover of 
the vessel removed, to aid evaporation, or a towel over the 
top, to absorb vapor. Boil half an hour. 

NEW POTATOES. 

Eub off the skins with a coarse towel in cold water ; put 
them in boiling water; cook twenty minutes; drain off the 
water, sprinkle with a little pepper and salt, and pour over 
melted butter or cream. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Skin, wash, and dry some new potatoes ; melt some butter 
in a stew-pan ; when it is quite hot, put the potatoes in it ; 
simmer them slowly, turning them occasionally. When done, 
take them up and place them in another stew-pan, with suf- 
ficient fresh butter to form a sauce; shake them over the fire 



VEGETABLES. 85 



merely till the butter is melted. Put them in a dish and 
pour the butter over them, and sprinkle with a little salt. 

POTATOES A LA CRE'ME. 
Put into a sauce-pan about two ounces of butter, a small 
table-spoonful of flour, some parsley chopped fine, salt, and 
pepper; stir these together; add a wine-glass of cream, and 
set it on the fire, stirring continually until it boils. Cut some 
boiled potatoes into slices, and put them into the sauce-pan 
with the mixture; boil up once, and serve hot. 

POTATO BALLS.— No. i. 

Two cups of mashed potatoes, one cup of grated ham, two 
well-beaten eggs, two table-spoonfuls of cream or milk, one 
table-spoonful of butter ; salt and pepper to taste. Make in- 
to balls, roll in flour, and fry in boiling lard. This is a good 
way to utilize cold potatoes; and it is a nice breakfast-dish. 

POTATO BALLS.— No. 2. 

Boil the potatoes; peel, and mash smooth, with one egg 
and a little flour, to keep it in form; add a little salt, pepper, 
and butter, and fry in boiling lard. 

BAKED POTATO. 

Boil the potatoes, and mash, with one egg, one table-spoon- 
ful of butter, and two table-spoonfuls of cream or milk. Bake 
quickly. 

Potatoes roasted in a very hot oven are both healthy and 
palatable. 

POTATOES MASHED WITH ONIONS. 

Prepare some boiled onions by putting them through a sieve, 
and mix them with potatoes. Regulate according to taste, 
seasoning with butter, pepper, and salt. 

MASHED POTATOES AND TURNIPS. 
Boil Irish potatoes as in No. 2; mash, and season. Boil 



GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



turnips ; mash, and season. Allow two thirds potatoes and 
one third turnips ; mix well, and add cream or milk to taste. 
This is an excellent dish, if nicely prepared. 

TO FRY SARATOGA POTATOES. 

Pare and cut Irish potatoes very thin; put them in cold 
water to soak over night. When ready, take them out of 
the water and wipe them dry, as they will not brown if they 
are not well dried. Have your lard about as you would for 
frying doughnuts, dropping in about two handfuls at a time, 
Stirling all the time, so that they will brown evenly. The 
quicker they are cooked, — so that they do not burn, — the 
better they are. Add a little salt when you take them out 
of the fat 

GREEN PEAS. 

Shell and wash the peas; cook in hot water enough to cov- 
er them for twenty minutes. When nearly done, add salt ; 
take them up clear of water. Season with butter, and, if 
desired, add a little cream. 

GREEN PEAS WITH MINT. 

Put the peas in cold w.ater to boil, with a little salt. Add 
one sprig of mint, one dessert-spoonful of sugar. When 
done, take out the mint, drain off the water, and season with 
butter and pepper. 

This is an English method of cooking peas. 

FRIED FIGS. 

Have large, ripe figs ; peel, and cut in half the long way 
of the fruit ; fry in a pan of hot butter, leaving the flat side 
of the fig up. Fry a light brown, and after dishing sprinkle 
with brown sugar. These are almost, if not quite, equal to 
fried plantains. 



VEGETABLES. 87 



TO BAKE LARGE, YELLOW CUCUMBERS. 

Cut off each end, carefully scrape out the inside, and peel 
them. Make a force-meat of beef or veal, onions, a part of a 
clove of garlic, pepper, and salt; roll in flour, and fry in hot 
lard; add a little water, and let it cook over a slow fire. By 
cooking slowly, it will make its own gravy. 

TO BOIL RICE 

Wash one pint of rice, and put in one and one half pints 
of boiling water, with one tea-spoonful of salt. When this 
boils up two or three times, set back where it will boil gently. 
Do not stir after setting back. 

RICE CROQUETTES. 

Half a cup of rice, one pint of milk, two table-spoonfuls 
of sugar, three eggs, one table-spoonful of melted butter, 
grated peel of a lemon, and a little salt. Soak the rice one 
or two hours in enough warm water to cover it; drain it al- 
most dry; put in the milk; steam until tender; add the 
sugar, butter, and salt; beat the eggs to a stiff froth and add 
to the mixture; cook five minutes; add the lemon-peel, and turn 
all on a buttered dish. When cold, flour your hands and roll 
in oval-shaped balls; dip them in well-beaten eggs and crack- 
er crumbs, and fry in boiling lard. 

BOILED SWEET-POTATOES. 

Wash and boil as Irish potatoes, but without peeling. When 
done sufficiently to pierce with a straw, take up and peel ; if 
large, cut in two the long way; put in a covered dish, and 
pour over them melted butter. Very new sweet-potatoes 
should always be boiled, as they are not sufficiently juicy or 
sweet to bake. 

BAKED SWEET-POTATOES. 

Wash, and bake in the oven with the skins on. When 



88 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

done, serve without peeling. When roasting beef or pork, 
peeled sweet-potatoes laid in the same pan around the meat, 
and allowed to cook in the gravy, are very nice. When 
cooked in this way, the potatoes, if large, should be cut 
through the length, so as to get thoroughly done, 

SLICED AND BAKED POTATOES. 

}>oil sweet-potatoes nearly done, peel, and cut in slices; 
put a layer of potatoes, bits of butter dotted over them, and 
sprinkle them well with sugar; add another layer of pota- 
toes, butter, and sugar, until the dish is full enough. Add 
very little water, and bake. 

TO FRY SWEET-POTATOES. 

Parboil the potatoes, peel, cut in slices, and fry to a nice 
brown in boiling lard. They can be fried without boiling, 
though it will require a longer time, and more lard or butter. 

TO STEW SALSIFY, OR VEGETABLE OYSTERS. 

Wash the roots nicely, parboil, and scrape off the outer 
skin; cut in thick slices, and put into a stew-pan, with water 
enough to cover it well; add a little salt and pepper; cook 
until quite tender. Then pour off the water; put in a large 
table-spoonful of butter; thicken with a little flour. A table- 
spoonful of cream improves it very much. A table-spoonful 
of vinegar added gives a pleasant flavor. Serve hot. Car- 
rots and parsnips may be prepared in the same way, leaving 
out the vinegar. 

SALSIFY PATTIES. 

Wash and scrape the roots; boil until quite tender; mash 
well; make a batter of one egg, a tea-cupful of flour, half a 
table-spoonful of butter, a little salt and pepper, and a little 
milk. Stir this into the salsify, and drop a large spoonful in- 
to boiling lard. Fry brown.

SPINACH. 

Wash thoroughly through two or three waters ; boil in 
salted water for fifteen or twenty minutes; then drain in a 
sieve. Put in a sauce-pan, with butter and pepper to taste; 
warm through, and serve with hard-boiled eggs sliced. 

BOILED SQUASH. 

Peel, cut, and boil the squash in salted water till tender. 
Drain and mash smoothly, seasoning with pepper and butter. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

Peel, and cut the squash in small squares of about an inch. 
Put a table-spoonful of butter in a stew-pan ; when heated, 
throw in the squash and cover tight; stir occasionally, and 
when nearly done add pepper and salt to taste. 

SQUASH-FRITTERS. 

Boil the squash ; mash smooth, with butter and pepper, 
adding a little flour and a well-beaten egg. Make in little 
cakes, and fry in hot lard. 

FRIED SQUASH. 

Peel and slice thin and evenly. Dip each slice in egg 
which has been seasoned with pepper and salt; then dip in 
bread or cracker crumbs, and fry in hot lard. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

The slices of squash may be dipped in batter, and fried in 
hot lard. When prepared in either of the above way3, it is 
almost impossible to distinguish it from egg-plant. 

MASHED TURNIPS. 

Peel, and boil in boiling water, with a little salt, until ten- 
der; drain them carefully from the water, mash smooth, and 
season with butter, pepper, and salt to taste. 



90 GULF GITY COOK-BOOK. 

WHOLE TURNIPS. 

Peel, and boil in salted water till tender; drain off the 
water, and add cream, butter, pepper, and salt to taste. 

TOMATOES. 

Pour scalding water over them, and let them remain in it 
a few minutes, or until the skins will come off easily. When 
peeled, put them in a stew-pan, with a little salt and butter, 
and stew them half an hour; add a little bread-crumbs or 
grated cracker. If sugar is not used, add a little black pep- 
per. 

SCALLOPED TOMATOES. 

Peel them; cover the bottom of a deep dish with them ; put 
salt, pepper, and butter on them; then add a layer of bread- 
crumbs or rolled cracker; then another layer of tomatoes, 
and a layer of crumbs, until the dish is filled; cover the top 
with crumbs. If sugar is desired, leave out pepper. Bake 
half an hour. If canned tomatoes are used, drain off the 
fluid before using. 

STUFFED TOMATOES. 
Select large and firm tomatoes; cut a very thin slice off the 
end opposite the stem; carefully take out the seeds and juice, 
so as not to break the tomato. Mix with the seeds and juice 
stale bread-crumbs or rolled cracker, salt, pepper, or sugar 
if preferred, two table-spoonfuls of butter. Then fill each 
tomato with the stuffing, place them in a deep baking-dish, 
aud cover them with a thin layer of the above mixture, and 
sprinkle dry crumbs on top. Bake from one half to three 
quarters of an hour, according to the size of tomato. 

BROILED TOMATOES. 

Cut them in thick slices; place them on a well-buttered 

broiling-iron, over a clear fire, having previously sprinkled 

with salt and pepper. Have ready a warm dish, place them 

in it, and pour melted butter on them. Serve them quite hot.

fuls of butter in a frying-pan; when hot, add one large onion 
chopped fine; let it fry for a few'minutes , add the tomatoes, 
and when nearly done, six eggs well beaten. 

MACARONI AND TOMATOES. 
Boil one half pound of macaroni in milk or water, and in 
a separate vessel stew one quart of tomatoes. Chop the to- 
matoes, and beat them up with two eggs, a table-spoonful of 
butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix all with the mac- 
aroni, and bake. 

BAKED MACARONI. 
Boil one half pound of macaroni till tender; strain off the 
water, and put in a deep dish, — buttered to prevent its stick 
ing, — with layers of grated or finely-cut cheese, butter, pep- 
per, and salt, alternating with layers of the macaroni. Fin- 
ish with the cheese layer on top. Bake till a nice brown — 
about twenty minutes or half an hour.

MILK YEAST FOR BREAD. 

Boil one pint of milk and half a tea-spoonful of salt. When 
the milk is cool, stir in enough flour to make a batter as thin 
as cream; keep it in a warm place; it will require about six 
hours to rise. To make up in bread, add flour until it is a 
soft dough; then mix one table-spoonful of lard, and let rise 
again for half an hour. Bake in a moderate oven. 

TO MAKE HOP YEAST. 

Pour a pint of cold water on a table-spoonful of hops; let 
it boil a short while ; strain the tea from the hops ; make a 
batter of flour and water, and mix with the tea; let it boil 
again. When cool, stir in meal as long as you can do so. 
with a spoon ; add two yeast cakes or a cup of yeast ; let it rise 
Then work in flour uptil it is stiff enough to roll ; cut out in 
cakes, lay on a dish, and dry in the shade. 

TO MAKE STOCK YEAST. 

Put one ounce of hops into a quart of boiling water; boil 
two minutes; strain enough of the tea on a half pound of 
flour to make a stiff paste. When well mixed, put in the 
balance of the hop tea; let this cool, and add half a pint of 
stock yeast. This will keep three days in warm weather, and 
a week in winter. 

TO MAKE THE FERMENT FOR BREAD. 

Wash three Irish potatoes, and boil (with skins on) in a 



94 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

quart of water until soft; use half a pound of flour; mash 
the potatoes, and rub them well into the flour. Make a paste 
the same as for stock yeast; then, with the potato tea and 
cold water, make this cool enough to bear the hand in it. 
Now add one half pint of stock yeast, and let it stand six or 
eight hours to rise. When this has risen and fallen, make 
the sponge for bread. Strain one pint of this ferment through 
a colander; add to this one pint of water, and make a soft 
batter of flour. Let this sponge rise four hours; add salt to 
make your bread; mold, and let it rise, and bake. 

ROLLS AND LIGHT BREAD. 

Take three pints of unsifted flour, and at noon have boiled 
a large Irish potato; while the potato is boiling, dissolve the 
half of a gem yeast-cake in a coffee-cup of lukewarm water. 
Take one of the three pints of flour, and sift it into a bowl; 
mash the potato quickly and very smoothly, and while hot ; 
put it into the pint of flour, and mix potato and flour well 
together with the hand; add a tea-spoonful of sugar and a 
small tea-spoonful of salt. Now pour onto this the cup of 
dissolved yeast; beat this batter well with a spoony cover 
this bowl of hatter, and place it where it will keep moderately 
warm. About eight o'clock at night, sift the other two pints 
of flour on the biscuit-board, leaving out a very little to 
knead the dough in the morning. Then take a table-spoon- 
ful of lard (not very heaping) ; mix it into the flour, adding 
another tea-spoonful of sugar and a tea-spoonful of salt. 
.Now pour the batter into this* flour, and knead the doiigh well ; 
put this dough into a jar or bowl that has a cover. Early 
next morning knead this dough over; make into rolls, and 
set to rise for breakfast. If this recipe is exactly followed, 
it can not fail. 

POTATO YEAST. 

Grate four Irish j>otatoes ; scald well in a quart of boiling 



BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC. 95 

water half a tea-cup of sugar, and the same quantity of salt ; 
put the mixture in a glass or stone jar, with a little yeast to 
make it rise; cork well, and keep it in a warm place the first 
day, or until it ferments. For two quarts of flour, use half 
a tea-cup of this yeast. It will keep for two weeks. 

LIGHT ROLLS. 

One quart of flour, a large spoonful of yeast, the same 
quantity of lard ; mix with warm water to a soft dough ; cover 
well, and let it rise all night in a warm place. Make out in 
rolls in the morning. They will rise in twenty minutes. 
Bake in a moderate oven. 

PARKER-HOUSE ROLLS. 

Two quarts of sifted flour, one pint of cold boiled milk, 
one table-spoonful of white sugar, one tea-spoonful of salt, 
half a pint of baker's yeast, and one large table-spoonful of 
lard. Make up sponge about three o'clock in the afternoon ; 
if quite light, about ten o'clock it will be ready to make into 
a dough. Knead well and let stand all night. It will be 
ready in the morning to mold into rolls. They rise and 
bake in a very little time. 

POTATO YEAST. 

Peel and boil one dozen good-sized Irish potatoes in one 
gallon of water till soft; mash them through a seive. Boil 
one handful of hops in the same water the potatoes were 
boiled in, and strain them into the mashed potatoes. Beat 
it well together; then add half a tea-cup of salt, half a tea- 
cup of sugar, and stir it well. After it becomes perfectly 
cold, add one yeast-cake, dissolved in a little of the hop-water. 
In two days it will be ready for use. Always stir it well be- 
fore using. 

BREAD. 

Make the bread with the above yeast as follows : Use three 



96 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

pints of flour; into one quart rub a table spoonful of lard, 
with a little salt. To one tea-cup of yeast add one egg, if 
you have it, and one table-spoonful of sugar ; stir well together, 
and pour into the quart of flour. Work it up with luke- 
warm water, adding by degrees the other pint of flour. 
Knead it till the dough is perfectly smooth, but not too stiff. 
In the morning, make out rolls. If the dough should be too 
soft, add a little more flour. 

SWISS ROLLS. 

Make a batter of one pint of flour, one cake of yeast dis- 
solved in lukewarm water, a large Irish potato, if convenient; 
when risen, two quarts of flour, one table-spoonful of lard 
and one of sugar, two eggs, and half a table-spoonful of salt. 
Pour in the yeast, rub the dough smooth, and set it to rise 
again. When well risen, make it into splits as follows: Koll 
out the dough half an inch thick; baste top with butter; 
cut out the size of a biscuit; lay one on the top of the other, 
and set it to rise. Just before baking, beat an egg and baste 
the top of each. 

POCKET-BOOKS. 

Beat the yelks of four eggs with two dessert-spoonfuls of 
sugar; then add one tea-cup' of sweet milk, with one large 
yeast-cake dissolved in it ; flour enough to make a stiff batter. 
Lastly, add the whites, after beating them to a stiff froth ; 
let rise. When very light, add one table-spoonful of butter; 
also one of lard. Sift the flour, and make a soft dough ; let 
it rise again, then make your pocket-books in the following 
manner: Work out the dough with a little more flour; roll 
in pieces about five inches long and three wide ; spread very 
little butter on one end; sprinkle with flour; fold like a 
pocket-book, put them to rise, and when risen bake. 

LIGHT BREAD. 

One quart of flour, one pint of boiled fresh milk, one ta- 



BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC. 9,7 

ble-spoonful of lard, one table-spoonful of sugar, tea-spoonful 
of salt, three table-spoonfuls of yeast dissolved in a little 
water; put the sugar and salt in the water. As soon as the 
milk boils, put it in a bowl to cool, and put in the lard. 
When quite cool, mix all and set it away to rise over night. 
Next morning work in a pint or more of flour, into which 
put one tea-spoonful of soda ; make into rolls or loaves, and 
set to rise again ; then bake. 

EXCELLENT GRAHAM BREAD. 

One quart of corn-meal, one pint of Graham flour, one cup 
of sour milk, one cup of molasses, one tea-spoonful of soda, 
one tea-spoonful of salt, and bake three hours. 

GRAHAM ROLLS. 

Boil two pounds of Irish potatoes, and mash through a 
colander; add to this one pint of water, one half cupful of 
yeast, and enough Graham flour to make a stiff dough. Set

let rise again, and then bake. Nice Graham rolls. 

GRAHAM GEMS. 

One cup of wheat flour, one cup of Graham flour, two eggs, 
two cups of fresh milk, half tea-spoonful of salt. G.rease 
and heat the pans very hot. Bake about half an hour. 

GRAHAM BREAD.— No. i. 

To one quart of lukewarm water add one tea spoonful of 
salt, two of brown sugar, and yeast as for flour bread; thick- 
en to a batter with sifted Graham flour, and let it rise until 
morning. Then add one half pint of new milk, one fourth 
tea-cup of molasses, one third teas]50onful of soda, a small 
piece of lard, and sufficient Graham flour to mold soft. Put 
into deep tins, and let rise. As soon as little cracks come on 
the top, put into a hot oven and bake one third longer than 
flour bread. This bread is better not to mold very much.

MILK-YEAST BREAD.— (Excellent.) 

To one pint of boiling new milk add one pint of lukewarm 
water, one tea-spoonful of salt, two of sugar, and one tea-cup 
of fine cornmeal. Add the cornmeal first, then flour enough 
to make quite a stiff batter; place in a jar or pitcher, and 
put it where it will be kept more than milk-warm; stir oc- 
casionally until it begins to rise. It will then be ready to 
mold in less than half an hour. Mold soft, place in deep tins, 
and at once begin to heat the oven, as it rises very quickly. 
The sponge should be ready to mold in five hours. 

RYE BREAD. 

One pint of rye flour, one of cornmeal, one table-spoonful 
of lard, one tea-spoonful of salt, "one tea-cup of good yeast; 
mix with water enough to make a stiff dough; knead well;

loaves. 

RUSK.— No. 1. 

One quart of flour, one cup of yeast, one of milk, one of 
brown sugar, three eggs, one nutmeg, two table- spoonfuls of 
butter; rub the sugar, butter, and nutmeg in the flour, then 
add the eggs well beaten, next the yeast and milk. Make 
the dough at night, and if more flour is necessary, add it next 
morning. Make into rolls ; let them rise a second time, and 
bake. 

RUSK.— No. 2. 

Beat an egg and a spoonful of sugar well ; add a half pint 
of well-risen yeast; then add another well-beaten egg, a largo 



BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC. 99 

cuj) of sugar, and one of butter; sift in sufficient flour to 
make a soft dough, and let rise till very light. Mold the rusk 
as you would rolls; fill the pan with them barely touching, 
and when well risen bake in a quick oven. 

SALLY LUNN. 

One quart of flour well beaten with three eggs, one cup of 
milk, half cup of butter, one tea spoonful of salt, one of soda, 
and two of cream of tartar ; dissolve the soda in a little warm 
water ; rub the cream of tartar thoroughly into the dry flour; 
put in the salt, slice the butter into the milk, and dissolve 
over a gentle fire, adding to it the flour. Mix all well, to the 
consistency of pound-cake, then bake in a pan as you would 
cake. 

HEALINGSPRINGS SALLY LUNN. 

To three well-beaten eggs add one table-spoonful of butter, 
one of sugar, one pint of sweet milk, one half tea-cup of 
yeast; mix in one and a half pounds of flour; let it rise; 
then beat up again ; and if too soft, beat in a little more 
flour. It should be the consistency of muffin batter. Make 
it up at night tor morning. 

CREAM-OF-TARTAR BISCUIT. 

Stir into one quart of flour two tea-spoonfuls cream of tar- 
tar, a little salt, one table-spoonful of butter or lard, with 
enough milk or water to make a soft dough. A table-spoon- 
ful of cream will improve them. They do not need much 
working. 

BISCUITS. 

One quart of flour, one table-spoonful of butter or lard, 
soda the size of a pea, mixed with milk or water, well worked, 
will make fifteen good biscuits. 

One heaping pint of flour, one tea-spoonful of salt, a piece 



100 GULF GITY COOK-BOOK. 



of lard the size of a walnut, one half tea-cup of new milk, 
and the same quantity of cold water. This makes a stiff, 
dry dough. It must be beaten or worked until it is perfectly 
elastic, then made into biscuits or rolled thin for crackers. 

BISCUIT WITH YEAST. 

Boil two large potatoes, and mash them while warm; put 
in one tea-spoonful of sugar, one of salt, a dessert-spoonful 
of lard, one cup of yeast or a yeast cake ; thicken with flour 
to a thick dough. In the morning, work in a little more 
flour; puncture with a fork, and let rise. 

YEAST-POWDER BISCUIT. 

Three quarters of a pound of flour, four ounces of butter 
and lard mixed, one table-spoonful of yeast-powder. Eub 
the yeast-powder, salt, lard, and butter into the flour dry 
until well mixed; then add two gills of water; work very 
little, and bake in a quick oven. 

CREAM BISCUIT. 

To three coffee-cups of sifted flour add one cup of sweet 
cream, two tea-spoonfuls of yeast-powder, a little salt; mix, 
and mold as little as possible to get the dough in shape. 
Bake in a brisk oven. Should the cream be thin, melt a 
piece of butter and pour into it, as rubbing shortening into 
the flour makes the dough less spongy. 

NICE BISCUIT-ROLLS FOR TEA. 

Make a nice biscuit dough, roll it out until it is about one 
eighth of an inch thick, butter it, then sprinkle well with 
sugar; begin at one end, as for jelly-cake, and roll; cut in 
pieces one and a half or two inches long; then bake. 

SPLIT BISCUIT. 

Two eggs, one pint of milk, two iron-spoonfuls of yeast, 
one table -spoonful of sugar, one of butter and lard mixed ; 



BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC. 101

cover close to rise. Next morning, put on pastry-board and 
work it; roll it out half an inch thick, and cut them out with a 
biscuit-cutter. Put a piece of butter about the size of a pea 
in the center of each one, and put another biscuit on the top; 
grease your pan, and put your biscuits in an inch apart, and 
grease each one of them on the top; set in a warm place 
to rise. This recipe will amply repay any one for their 
trouble. 

ST. JAMES BREAD.— (Very Nice.)

mush. When milk-warm, stir in one egg at a time until five 
are added; put in a little salt; make into small balls, and 
drop into boiling lard ; fry until a light brown. 

BREAKFAST PUFFS. 

Take one pint of milk, one pint of flour, two eggs, a lump 
of butter the size of an egg, and a little salt; place the flour 
in a bowl; put the butter in the center of the flour; break 
in the eggs, and knead thoroughly; then gradually add the 
milk, so as to make a smooth batter. The puffs may be bak- 



102 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

ed in a cast-iron pan with small divisions, or small patty-pans. 
These should be heated, buttered, and filled about two thirds 
full. Place in a quick oven. They take but a few minutes 
to bake. 

COLONNADE PUFFS. 

Put in one quart of milk two well-beaten eggs, with very 
thin batter and a little salt. Grease the cup thoroughly; put 
half full, and bake in a quick oven. 

TURN-OVERS. 

To two pints of flour add three well-beaten eggs, a table- 
spoonful of sugar, and a little salt; work it well, and put it to 
rise. In the morning, work in a small table-spoonful of but- 
ter ; make into thin cakes, and turn half edges, not quite 
meeting.

flour, and half tea-spoonful of salt. Dissolve one table- 
spoonful of butter in a gill of milk, and pour it on the hom- 
iny ; add flour enough to roll this into cakes, and cut out 
like biscuits. Bake quickly 

DECEPTIONS. 

Take the yelks of three eggs and the white of one worked 
up with as much flour as will make it as thick as biscuit- 
dough. Beat well; it must be very light. Divide in small pieces 
and roll very thin; have ready a skillet of boiling lard ; put 
one in at a time, and turn as soon as done ; then take out 
and put on a sifter or dish, and sprinkle sugar on them.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CAKE. 



Cake, to be nice, should be made of the best materials. 
Butter and eggs should both be fresh. Some persons enter- 
tain the mistaken notion that butter which can not be eaten 
on bread will do very well for cake. On the contrary, the 
baking increases the bad flavor. It is a good plan to wash 
the butter in clear water before using it. The whites and 
yelks of the eggs should be beaten to a stiff froth, separately. 
Brown sugar will answer for some kinds of cake, if free from 
lumps and creamed well with the butter. When soda is 
used, dissolve before adding to the general mixture. Butter 
the baking-pan well, covering the bottom with buttered 
white paper. In cake-baking much of the success depends 
on the oven, which should be well and evenly heated before 
the cake is put in ; and never allow the heat to diminish, or 
the cake will fall, — except fruit-cake, which should remain 
in the oven, while it cools Mown gradually. Avoid moving 
the cake while baking, as it tends to make it heavy. When 
the cake is done it will leave the sides of the pan. It is a 
good plan to put a pan filled with warm water on the top 
range of the stove after the cake rises, as it prevents burning 
or cooking too fast. To prevent browning too fast, lay a pa- 
per over the top of the cake. Avoid any contact of draft 
while baking.

GENERAL RULES FOR PASTRY. 

Pastry should be made on a cold, smooth substance, such 
as marble, mixing with a knife. It should be made quickly; 
much handling makes it heavy. Great nicety is required in 
wetting the paste, too little moisture rendering it dry and 
crumbly, while too much makes it tough and heavy. Keserve 
half of the butter and a fourth of the flour to be used in roil- 
ing out the paste. .Roll it out lightly, dredge with flour, and 
spread with butter; fold, and roll again, repeating the same 
three or four times, always rolling fast and pressing on light- 
ly. When you see the sui-face of the paste covered with 
blisters, you may be sure that it is a success; that is, if it is 
baked properly, for the quality of the paste depends much 
on the baking. The oven should be well and evenly heated 
before baking, and not allowed to cool. 

PUFF-PASTE.— No. i. 

One pound of flour, one pound of butter, one egg; mix the 
flour with two table-spoonfuls of butter, and make a dough 
with cold water and the egg; divide the remainder of the 
butter into six equal parts; roll the paste, and spread on one 
part of the butter, dredging it with flour; repeat until all 
the butter is rolled in. Great care is necessary to prevent 
the butter from bursting through. Handle as little as pos- 



136 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

sibie. It is improved by standing awhile on ice before bak- 
ing. 

PUFF-PASTE.— No. 2. 

One pound of flour, three quarters of a pound butter; rub 
into the flour two ounces of butter; then make a dough with 
cold water; then proceed to roll in butter and flour according 
to the general directions given above. 

PASTRY. 

One quart of flour, quarter of a pound of butter, quarter 
of a pound of lard ; make a dough of the flour and lai'd, 
using as little water as possible; roll it out lightly; dredge 
with flour; spread with butter in bits; fold and roll again; 
repeat until the butter is all used. 

PLAIN PASTRY. 

Three cups 01 flour, one cup of butter, one cup of lard, one 
cup of cold water. Mix with a knife; roll from you. This 
is enough for two pies, with crusts top and bottom. 

PLAIN PIE-CRUST. 

Nine ounces of lard, one pound of flour, a pinch of salt. 
Eub the lard and flour well together; add water sufficient to

PUDDINGS. 



GENERAL RULES. 

In boiling puddings, mind that the cloth be perfectly clean. 
Dip it in hot water and dredge well with flour, by sifting 
the flour over it. When bagged, tie the string tight, leaving 
sufficient room in the bag for expansion by swelling. Flour 
and Indian puddings require muc'h room. Put the pudding 
in a pot of boiling water, placing an old plate on the bottom. 
Keep sufficient water in the pot to cover the pudding, being 
careful not to let the boiling cease one second. A tea-kettle 
of boiling water should be at hand to add as the water boils 
away. Dip the pudding into cold water immediately upon 
taking out, which prevents its adhering to the cloth. Make 
your pudding-bag of thick cloth ; if it is thin, it will admit 
the water and deteriorate the pudding. If you use a pud- 
ding-mold, grease well with butter from which the salt has 
been carefully washed.

One pint of milk, one quart of cream, yelks of five eggs, 
beaten light with the sugar, three cups of sugar, one lemon- 
juice and grated peel, one glass of sherry, and one half pound 
of crystallized fruits chopped. Heat the milk to boiling, pour 
slowly over the eggs and sugar, beating all together well. 
Eeturn to the fire and boil until sufficiently thick. When 
cold, beat in the cream, and partly freeze before you stir in 
the fruit and wine. Then freeze hard.

through a sieve. Stir into a rich custard, with the addition 
of cream well sweetened, and freeze. 

MACAROON ICE-CREAM. 

Make a custard of one quart of milk, four eggs, and sweet- 
en to your taste. When cool, add a quart of cream, sweet- 
ened and whipped light. Stir in two dozen macaroons, pow- 
dered very fine, and freeze. 

COFFEE FROZEN. 

Prepare the coffee as for the table ; add cream and sugar, 
making it sweeter than for the table. Freeze and serve in 
after dinner coffee-cups. 

COCOA-NUT ICE-CREAM. 

Make boiled custard, putting six eggs to a quart of milk. 
Just before freezing grate one cocoa-nut into half a gallon of 
custard. The milk of the cocoa-nut must not be used, nor 
cream, as it will be too rich. 

FROZEN PLUM-PUDDING. 

Two quarts of well-frozen ice-cream in a freezer, two 
ounces of raisins chopped, two ounces of currants, two 
ounces of citron cut very thin, one and a half ounce of 
chocolate grated fine, and one pint of Madeira wine. Put 
these ingredients into a stew-pan, and set it on the fire; let 
it stew slowly half an hour ; when cold, mix with the ice- 
cream, to which you may add one cup of strawberry pre- 
serves, one of peach, and one of cherries ; then let it freeze. 
Serve with whipped cream, flavored with vanilla or with 
maraschino. 

WHITE ICE-CREAM. 

Two quarts of fresh milk, twelve ounces of sugar, whites 
of eight eggs whipped, and two table-spoonfuls of arrow-root. 
Boil all together until thick as custard, and when cold add 
one quart of whipped cream. 



ICES. 161 

FROZEN BUTTERMILK. 

Strain the buttermilk through a thin cloth, so as to remove 
all lumps and particles of butter, add sugar until very, very 
sweet, and flavor with vanilla. Freeze as you would ice- 
cream. 

PINE-APPLE SHERBET, OR ICE. 

Take four pine-apples, pare them, and cut in thin slices ; 
put in a bowl with two pounds of loaf-sugar ; let it stand one 
hour, then separate the slices from the juice and pour over 
them three quarts of boiling water. When cold, strain 
through a coarse cloth, squeeze hard, then add the juice and 
freeze. 

PINE-APPLE SHERBET. 

Two cans of pine-apple; cut off the dark spots from the 
slices; chop very fine, and pour over it two quarts of boiling 
water; strain into this the juice; also, the juice of four lem- 
ons, five tea-cupfuls of white sugar, and just before freezing 
beat in the whites of six eggs, which have been whipped to a 
stiff froth. 

FROZEN CLARET. 

Make a sweet sangaree; flavor with lemon-juice and peel. 
Freeze. 

LEMON SHERBET. 

Make a rich lemonade of twelve lemons; straxi through a 
thick cloth and add the whites of six eggs beaten to a froth 
Freeze. 

ITALIAN SNOW.

water, and sugar to the taste. Rind of four oranges grated 
on sugar. Freeze. 

BISQUE GLACE'.— No. i. 

Beat well together the yelks of eight eggs, and eight 
ounces of powdered sugar. Flavor one pint of good milk 
with vanilla, and boil it. Dissolve in a vessel set in hot 
water one and a half ounce of gelatine, and as soon as it is 
dissolved mix with the boiling milk; pour the boiling milk 
slowly on to the eggs and sugar, stirring all the time; when 
well mixed pass through a sieve and put in a very cold place 
to cool. This is called "apperiel," or preparation. Beat 
one pint of cream to a stiff froth, and when well beaten add 
it slowly to the mixture already prepared, which should be 
quite cold. To freeze, you must have a tin mold, either 
square or rectangular; fill this with little paper molds, which 
must fit the tin mold exactly in every part. Fill the little 
paper cases with the mixture, and cover the tin mold with a 
hermetically fitting top. In the bottom of a box made for 
the purpose, put about eight inches of pounded ice and coarse 
salt in alternate layers; in this place your tin mold of Bisque 
Glace' and another eight inches of ice and salt; cover the 
whole with a thick, heavy cloth, and let it stand six or eight 
hours. The box containing the ice and salt should have a 
small hole, to allow the escape of the water from the melted 
ice. When the mold is taken from the ice, wipe well before 
opening, to prevent any salt-water getting in. It is then 
ready to serve. 

BISQUE GLACE'.— No. 2. 

Take some pieces of broken sugar, and rub off the rind of 
four lemons; then pulverize the sugar and mix with half a 
pound of pulverized loaf-sugar, moistened with the juice of 
the lemons. Beat six eggs very light; stir them gradually 
into a quart of cream, in turn with the sugar and lemons. 



ices. , 163 

Have ready some stale sponge-cake, grated very fine; stir 
into the mixture until it is a thick batter, which must bo 
beaten until perfectly free from lumps. Put into a porcelain 
kettle, and let it boil up once, stirring it nearly all the time ; 
then freeze as ice-cream. 

CARAMEL ICE-CREAM.— No. i. 

One gallon of sweet cream, four tea- cups of powdered su- 
gar, and five table-spoonfuls of caramels. Caramels. — Put in 
a stew-pan one t'ea-cup of nice brown sugar, and half a cup 
of water. Stew over a hot fire till it burns a little. 

CARAMEL ICE-CREAM.— No. 2. 

Make a rich custard of one pint of milk and five or six 
eggs. Put two pints of brown sugar in a skillet, and stir 
constantly over a brisk fire until it is dissolved; do not let it 
burn. Stir into the custard while both are hot. When cold 
pour it into three quarts of cream well beaten. Freeze 



CREAMS, JELLIES, &c. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE.— No. i. 

Soak in a pint of fresh milk one box of Cox's refined gela- 
tine. Make a boiled custard of one pint of milk, two eggs, 
and one fourth pound of powdered sugar. Put the gelatine 
that is soaked in the milk on the fire, stirring constantly un- 
til it is dissolved. After it gets boiling hot strain into a 
large bowl. The custard may be strained into this as soon 
as it is made. Stand in a cool place, and have two pints of 
pure cream, with sugar enough to sweeten, whipped to a stiff 
froth; add this just before it congeals; flavor according to 
taste with vanilla or other extract. The whites of four or 
five eggs whipped to a stiff froth, and stirred very hard and

rapidly into the Charlotte, after the cream has been put in, 
makes it very light and delicate. Have the mold lined with 
lady-fingers, and pour the Charlotte Kusse in just as it begins 
to congeal. Do not let the cake project above the Charlotte, 
as it would prevent its standing nicely when turned out. If 
the cakes should be too long cut them off evenly, and push 
the little ends into the surface. Unless the weather is cold, 
the mold should be placed on ice. In a few hours it will be 
ready to turn out on the stand, and ready to be served. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE.— No. 2. 

One quart of thick cream, one half pint of milk, one ounce 
of gelatine, whites of seven eggs, yelks of five eggs, twelve 
ounces of sugar. Dissolve the gelatine in the boiling milk; 
take off the fire, stir in the yelks, and then the sugar and the 
flavoring. When the custard is cold, but not congealed, stir 
in the cream, which has been beaten to a stiff froth, and 
lastly the whites of the eggs. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE— No. 3. 

Dissolve three fourths box of Nelson's gelatine in a pint of 
warm milk. Make a thick custard of one pint of milk, one 
fourth pound of powdered sugar, the whites of four eggs, and 
yelks of two. When done, add the gelatine, stirring all till 
cool; flavor with one tea-spoonful of vanilla. Whip three 
pints of cream, sweetened with powdered sugar, to a stiff 
froth, and add to the custard and gelatine. Do not whip 
after they are well mixed, but pour into a mold lined with 
lady fingers, or sliced sponge-cake. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE WITHOUT EGGS. 

Two thirds of a box of Cox's gelatine, dissolved in 

a tea-cup of sweet milk. Beat to a stiff froth one quart of 

sweet cream sweetened, and flavored with vanilla. After 

the gelatine is dissolved and cool, stir it into the cream and

fingers. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE. 

Beat separately the yelks and whites of five eggs. Add to 
the yelks three fourths pound of loaf-sugar, beat well. Soak 
in not quite a half a pint of water a half box of gela- 
tine, and put it on to boil. Whip very light one quart of 
cream. Flavor the custard. Pour the boiling water and 
gelatine over the yelks a,nd sugar, beating all the time. 
When cold enough, add the cream. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE WITHOUT CREAM. 

Haifa box of gelatine in a large cup of water, one pint of 
milk, one cup of sugar, and four eggs. Beat the yelks and 
sugar, stir into the boiling milk ; let this cook until nearly 
as thick as boiled custard, then add the gelatine. When 
nearly cold add the whites of the egg?, whipped to a froth. 
Flavor with vanilla. 

BLANC-MANC E. 

Boil a quart of milk and sweeten to the taste. Dissolve an 
ounce of isinglass or gelatine, and pour it into the milk ; at 
the same time remove the milk from the fire. When nearly 
cold flavor with vanilla and pour into a mold. Set it on ice 
to harden. 

CHOCOLATE BLANC-MANGE. 

In one pint of water dissolve one ounce of gelatine. Boil 
one quart of milk, four ounces of grated chocolate, and three 
fourths pound of sugar together for five minutes; then add 
the gelatine, and stirring constantly boil five minutes longer.

mold. To be eaten with sweet cream. 

NEAPOLITAN BLANC-MANGE. 
One quart of milk, one ounce of gelatine, three ounces of 



16(5 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



almonds blanched and pounded in a mortar with one table- 
spoonful of rose-water, to prevent oiling, and three fourths 
cup of sugar. Heat the milk to boiling, having previously 
soaked the gelatine in a cup of it for an hour. Put this in 
when the milk is boiling hot ; add the pounded almonds, and 
stir all together ten minutes before putting in the sugar. 
When the gelatine has dissolved, strain through a thin mus- 
lin bag, pressing it well to get. out the flavor of the almonds. 
There should be three or four bitter ones among them. Sep- 
arate the blanc-mange into four different portions. Into 
one part beat one large table-spoonful of chocolate wet with 
a very little boiling water, and rubbed to a smooth paste, for 
the brown ; beat into the other part a large table- spoonful of 
currant jelly for the pink (or currant or cranberry juice), 
yelk of an egg, beaten light for the yellow. Leave the 
fourth part uncolored. Return each part, except the fourth, 
to the fire, stirring until very hot, but not boiling. When 
cold and a little stiff, pour carefully into a wet mold, the 
white first, then the pink, next the yellow, and the chocolate 
last. Set in a cool place. Loosen, when firm, by dipping 
the mold in warm water for a moment, and turn out on your 
stand, when the order of colors will be reversed. Put a lit- 
tle vanilla with the chocolate. 

SYLLABUB.— No. i. 

Have a quart of very rich cream ; wash and wipe four 
lemons, and with a very sharp knife pare off the entire rind. 
Mix one half pint of Madeira wine with half pint of white 
sugar, powdered, and the lemon-peels; let it stand to extract 
the flavor of the lemons; then add it slowly to the cream, 
and whip up the whole. 

SYLLABUB.— No. 2. 

One quart of cream, the whites of four eggs, one glass of 
white wine, and two tea-cups of powdered sugar. Whip half 



CREAMS, JELLIES, &>c. 167 

the sugar into the cream ; the remainder into the eggs. Mix 
these, add the wine, and flavor to the taste. 

TO WHIP CREAM. 

Sweeten the cream with powdered white sugar; flavor 
with any extract, or with lemon or orange, by rubbing sugar 
on the peel. Set a bowl near with a sieve over it, then whip 
the cream, and as it rises to a froth take it off with a skim- 
mer, and put it into the sieve to drain; whip also the cream 
which drains off. If the cream is a little sour, it may be 
sweetened by adding a small quantity of soda. 

ALMOND-CREAM. 

Beat four ounces of sweet almonds, and a few bitter ones, 
in a mortar, with a tea-spoonful of water, to prevent oiling, — 
both having been blanched. Put the paste to a quart of 
cream, and add the juice of three lemons, and sweeten to the 
taste; beat it to a froth, which take off on the shallow part 
of a sieve. Fill glasses with some of the liquor and froth. 

IMPERIAL CREAM. 

Boil a quart of cream, with the thin rind of a lemon, and 
stir it until nearly cold. Have ready in a bowl or dish that 
you are going to serve it in, the juice of three lemons 
strained, with as much sugar as' will sweeten the cream, 
which pour into the dish from a large tea-pot, holding it 
high, and moving it about to mix with the juice. It should 
be made at least six hours before it is used; and a day is 
better. 

ITALIAN CREAM.— No. i. 

One quart of cream, two boxes of gelatine, one pound of 
sugar, yelks of ten eggs, and flavor the cream to the taste — 
strawberry flavoring is the nicest. Whip the -cream to a 
stiff froth. Beat the eggs very light, and mix in the sugar 
well; then pour in the cream. Dissolve the gelatine in suffi- 



168 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

cient warm water to cover it, and when it begins to congeal 
add it to the mixture. Pour all into the mold, and when 
stiff cover with grated cocoa-nut or syllabub, ornamented 
with bright jellies or preserves. 

ITALIAN CREAM.— Nc. 2. 

Three three pints of cream or milk, and sweeten with sugar 
to the taste ; flavor with vanilla, and add one paper of gela- 
tine. Stir constantly until it boils ; beat in the yelks of eight 
eggs, and stir them well into the boiling milk; strain it into 
a mold, and let it stand on ice five or six hours. Serve with 
sweetened cream. 

BAVARIAN CREAM.— No. 1. 

Take half a box of gelatine ; pour on it one pint of cold 
milk; when soft pour on a pint of hot milk, and sweeten to 
your taste. While this is congealing churn up a quart of 
rich cream ; sweeten and flavor to your taste. When the 
gelatine begins to thicken, beat in the syllabub, which must 
be churned very thick. You may add a little milk if the 
cream is too thick. Do not put in any of the thin part of the 
syllabub, as it will make it heavy. 

BAVARIAN CREAM.— No. 2. 

One quart of thick cream, one pint of milk, two eggs well 
beaten, half box of Cox's sparkling gelatine. First, pour a 
small cup of milk on the gelatine; let this stand while the 
cream is being whipped. Flavor the cream with wine and 
sugar, as you would syllabub. Put the pint of milk on the 
fire; as soon as it is hot pour the soft gelatine into it and 
immediately put in the beaten eggs. Stir them rapidly in 
until the custard is done. Pour out, sweeten and flavor with 
vanilla ; when cold, whip up the cream, and before the cus- 
tard congeals stir it rapidly in. 



CREAMS, JELLIES, &*c. 169 



SPANISH CREAM. 

Three pints of milk, one ounce of gelatine, six eggs, twelve 
table-spoonfuls of sugar. Beat the yelks and sugar together. 
Soak the gelatine in about half a pint of cold water, pour the 
boiling milk on the eggs and sugar, then stir in the gelatine; 
put it on the fire and let come to a boil, take off and place to 
cool; flavor with vanilla. When it commences to conceal 
stir in the whites, which have been beaten to a froth. 

RASPBERRY CREAM. 

Put two large table-spoonfuls of raspberry jam in a fine 
sieve, pour over, and work through one pint of cream, then 
whisk it until it thickens. Meanwhile dissolve half an ounce 
of gelatine, two ounces of white sugar in a tea-cup of milk, 
and add gradually to the cream. When quite thick turn 
into a mold. 

CHARLOTTE POLONAISE. 

Boil over a slow fire one and a half pints of cream. While 
it is boiling have ready six yelks ; stir them gradually into 
the boiling cream — take care to have it smooth and free from 
lumps. Let this mixture boil ten minutes, then divide it by 
putting into two sauce-pans. Mix into one pan six ounces of 
chocolate grated fine, two ounces of loaf-sugar, one fourth 
pound of macaroons broken fine. Put into the other pan 
one dozen bitter almonds, four ounces of shelled sweet 
almonds blanched and pounded, one ounce of citron cut 
fine, and four ounces of pounded sugar. Stir this in well; let 
it come to a boil and set aside to cool. Cut a large sponge- 
cake into slices half an inch thick; spread one slice thickly 
with chocolate cream, and one with almond cream. Do this 
alternately until all the cream is used up. Serve cold. 

AMBROSIA.— No. I. 
Eight or a dozen oranges peeled and sliced, one cocoa-nut 



170 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

•_ , 

grated, one pine-apple sliced. Alternate layers of each with 
sugar and wine. 

AMBROSIA.— No. 2. 

Alternate layers of sliced oranges and grated cocoa-nut, 
sugar sprinkled upon each layer of orange; have the top of 
cocoa-nut. 

APPLE-FLOAT. 

A quart of stewed apples mashed fine and passed through 
a fine sieve, sweetened with white sugar to the taste, flavored 
with vanilla or lemon — grating the rind in the apples if fla- 
vored with lemon. Stir in the well-beaten whites of four 
eggs. Beat until very light. Serve with rich cream ; or pile 
on glass bowl half filled with cream or rich custard. Very 
nice mixed with cream and frozen. 

APPLE ME'RINGUE. 

To three or four cups of nice mashed apples, add beaten 
yelks of two eggs, half cup of sugar, a little milk, one and a 
half table-spoonfuls of butter. Mix well and bake a few min- 
utes; when cold, spread evenly on top a me'ringue made of 
whites of eggs, beaten to a stiff froth and sweetened. 

PORCUPINE. 

Eight eggs to a pint and a half of milk. Take out four 
whites. Boil the milk and pour it on the beaten eggs. 
When just ready to boil take off and stir till cool, or it will 
curdle. Sweeten to taste, and flavor as you choose. Put a 
loaf of sponge-cake into a deep dish, soak thoroughly with 
wine, and then stick over it blanched almonds cut in pieces. 
Pour over the custard just before sending to the table. 

APPLE-SOUFFLE'. 

Twelve large apples, half pound of sugar, six eggs, one 
pint of milk, and one lemon. Pare and core the apples, stew 



CREAMS, JELLIES, &c. 171 

them with the lemon-peel and sugar until quite soft ; press 
through a sieve. Make a custard with the yelks of the eggs 
and milk. Half fill a pie-dish with the apples, and cover 
with the custard. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff 
froth, and spread on the custard. Sift a table-spoonful of 
white sugar over all, and bake in a moderate oven for ten 
minutes. 

CATEAN POMMES. 

Boil in a pint of water one pound and a half of loaf-sugar, 
till it becomes a rich sirup. Weigh two pounds of apples 
after they have been peeled, cored, and cut small ; boil them 
in the sirup with the grated peel and juice of a large lemon, 
till they are reduced to a pulp; then put it into a mold. The 
following day serve it turned out in a glass dish, with a rich 
custard. 

BOILED CUSTARD. 

To each quart of milk allow five eggs and five table-spoon- 
fuls of sugar. Put the milk on the fire with half the sugar ; 
whip the whites to a stiff froth, and when the milk is scalding 
hot put it in the whites with a skimmer, and when partially 
set take them out. Have the yelks well beaten with the 
balance of the sugar, and put in the milk, stirring constantly 
till thick, to prevent scorching. When sufficiently thick 
take up and flavor to the taste. Serve in cups or glasses, 
laying the whites on the top, and grating nutmeg over it. 

BAKED APPLES. 

Pare, core, and cut in thin slices, sprinkle sugar between 
each layer and bake. They will be candied and excellent. 
Peaches and pears prepared in the same way are very nice. 

BAKED PEARS. 
Peel and core the pears, place them in a baking-dish, and 
fill the middle of each with brown sugar; also, strew sugar 



172 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

over the pan about an inch thick. The juice of lemon or 
orange-peel, or stick of cinnamon inserted in the center of 
each piece, will improve the flavor. Add enough water to 
dissolve the sugar. Bake until quite soft. Serve with cream 
or milk. 

TIPSY-CAKE.— No. i. 

Cut a sponge-cake through twice, to make three pieces; 
put layer upon layer in a dish, with wine and jelly between 
each piece; make a rich custard to pour over the whole. The 
above is a good way to utilize not only stale sponge-cake, but 
cup or pound cake. 

TIPSY-CAKE.— No. 2. 

Pour over a jelly-cake as much white wine as it will ab- 
sorb, and stick it all over with blanched sweet almonds. Serve 
with whipped cream. 

LEMON-JELLY 

One box of Cox's gelatine dissolved in one pint of cold 
water, the juice and rind of three lemons if large, four if 
small, one and three fourth pounds of loaf-sugar, three pints 
of boiling water, five wine-glasses of wine (sherry, cooking- 
wine, or Champagne). When nearly cold, strain and set 
aside to congeal. 

WINE-JELLY.— No. 1. 

One package of gelatine, one quart of water, three fourths 
of a pound of white sugar, four lemons, half pint of sherry 
or good Madeira wine, one ounce of mixed spice — cloves, all- 
spice, mace, and cinnamon. Put the gelatine, sugar, water, 
spices, juice and peel of the lemons into a brass or porcelain- 
lined kettle; set on the fire, stirring occasionally, until the 
gelatine is perfectly dissolved. Have ready the stiffly-beaten 
whites of two eggs, with which you have mixed a dozen or 
fifteen pieces of charcoal, each piece about the size of the end 



CREAMS, JELLIES, &>c, 173 

of your finger; empty the eggs and charcoal into the mixture 
on the fire; stir well, and just before it begins to boil add 
the wine. Kemove from the fire just as soon as it boils up 
once; let it stand in the kettle about five minutes, and 
then strain through a flannel jelly-bag until clear. If you 
wish to have it a beautiful amber color, drop in just before 
taking from the fire a few drops of liquid burned sugar. B} T 
using more or less of the burned sugar you can obtain any 
shade of amber you wish 

WINE-JELLY.— No. 2. 

To one pint of cold water add one ounce of gelatine, the 
juice and slices of two lemons; let it stand until the gelatine 
softens, and pour over one pint of boiling water, one full pint 
of loaf-sugar ; stir till thoroughly dissolved, and pour in. a 
pint of wine ; strain through a flannel-bag, and set aside to 
congeal. In this way jelly can be made with little time and 
trouble. 

JELLY AND FRUIT. 

Line a charlotte or jelly-mold with various kinds of fruit, 
such as stoned cherries, strawberries, pieces of peaches, etc., 
by dipping the fruit in jelly and sticking it to the sides. Ar- 
range in any design wished ; then fill the mold with wine- 
jelly, and place on ice. This makes a beautiful dish, if the 
fruit is arranged with taste. 

JELLY OF IRISH MOSS. 

Half an ounce of Irish moss, a pint and a half ©f fresh 
milk; boil down to a pint, and remove any sediment by 
straining. Add one tea-cupful of sugar; lemon-juice or 
peach-water to give an agreeable flavor. 

CALF OR HOG FOOT JELLY. 

Have four feet scalded and scraped ; split them, and boil 
them in a gallon of water until they have gone to pieces, and 



174 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

the liquor reduced to one half. Skim off all grease ; strain 
the liquor through a jelly-bag ; set aside to cool, when it will 
be a firm cake of jelly. To each quart allow a pound of su- 
gar, a pint of Madeira wine and a wine-glass of brandy, three 
sticks of cinnamon, juice and grated peel of four lemons, 
the whites of four eggs; boil twenty minutes ; do not stir; 
then add a tea-cup of cold water, and boil five minutes long- 
er. Strain through a flannel bag; but do not squeeze or press 
the bag, as it will render the jelly cloudy. 

MARASCHINO JELLY. 

Add to some nice, clear gelatine jelly maraschino enough 
to flavor it. Put the mold into a vessel, with ice and salt 
around it; then put the mold one fourth full of jelly; place 
in it as it cools a layer of Malaga grapes. When this is con- 
gealed, pour on some more jelly which is cold, but not con- 
gealed; then another layer of grapes; fill up the mold in 
this way. Serve when stiff. If in preparing it the jelly 
stiffens too rapidly, set it in warm water. Other kinds of 
fruit can be substituted lor the grapes. 



PAESER VES AND J EL L IES. 175 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 



In making preserves, procure firm, ripe fruit, as it is desir- 
able to have the natural flavor of the fruit, which can not be 
obtained from hard, unripe fruit. Use the best loaf-sugar; 
but if not convenient, good brown sugar will do by clarify- 
ing, which may be done by stirring in the sirup the whites 
of one or two eggs, carefully taking off the scum as it rises, 
until the sirup is clear. 

It is not well to expose the fruit long to the action of the 
sun, as it has a tendency, to toughen it. Have your jars well 
cleaned by washing in weak lye, or soda-water. Put your 
preserves in the jars hot, which may be done without risk by 
placing the jars on a towel folded in several thickness sat- 
urated with cold water. Cover the top with a paper cut to 
fit inside the mouth of the jars ; wet in brandy or whisky ; 
cork tightly. 

FIG PRESERVES. 

i 

Drop them in a weak salaratus-water, and let remain for 
fifteen minutes ; wipe them dry, and to a pound of figs allow 
three quarters of a pound of sugar. When the sirup has 
well boiled, put in the figs, and boil them untif they look 
clear; take out the fruit, and sun it for two hours; then re- 
turn to the sirup, and boil a little while before taking off. 

They may be flavored with either ginger, mace, cinnamon, 
or lemon. If lemons are used, do not put them in the boil- 
ing sirup, as that will make them hard. Slice them, take 
out the seeds, and put in a vessel with a very little water, 



176 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK, 

and boil until tender; then pour the lemon and the water in 
which it was boiled into the sirup. If lemons can not be ob- 
tained, use the oil of lemon, which should be put in when 
taken from the fire. 

TO PRESERVE BLUE FIGS. 

Peel, and throw into a solution of lime-water (one table- 
spoonful of air-slacked lime to half a bucket of water). Let 
them remain for nearly an hour; drain well. To every pound 
of figs add three quarters of a pound of white sugar. Slice 
lemons very thin ; take out the seeds, and strain in the pre- 
serving-kettle until tender; use as little water as will dis- 
solve the sugar; then put in the figs, and let them boil until 
cooked through. Seal up in jars while boiling hot. 

FIG MARMALADE. 

Use ripe figs; place them in cooking soda-water for a few 
minutes; wipe dry with a coarse cloth; then put them on to 
boil, with just water enough to cover them; boil until soft, 
mashing often. When soft, put three quarters of a pound of 
sugar to a pound of figs ; cook slowly ; stir frequently to 
prevent burning. Flavor with oil of lemon, or anything 
preferred. 

TOMATO PRESERVES. 

I 

The impression generally prevails that these preserves are 
very indifferent, but, if properly prepared, they will rival any 
fruit. Take half a bushel of ripe tomatoes; scald and peel, 
and as they' ai*e peeled plunge into cold water ; cut them in 
halves (across the tomato), so as to extract any seed; throw 
again in cold water, and when cleansed and thoroughly 
washed, weigh, allowing one pound of loaf-sugar to the same 
of fruit. Make a sirup of sugar and sufficient water ; when 
thick enough, add the tomatoes; cook slowly until done. Be 
careful when they are nearly done, or they will burn. Fla-

vor with sliced lemon cut in the preserves when about half 
done. 

STRAWBERRY PRESERVES. 

Stem and wash the fruit carefully, and to every pound of 
fruit allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Put in a kettle a layer of 
fruit and a layer of sugar; let stand about an hour, and they 
will make sufficient juice without adding water. (Do not 
let them stand too long, or they will have a shrunken ap- 
pearance.) Boil until done, but not too fast. Blackberries 
may be preserved in the same way. 

BLACKBERRY JAM. 

Weigh the fruit, and press it through a colander. To 
every pound of berries add a little more than half a pound 
of sugar. Boil slowly until as thick as desired, stirring con- 
stantly. 

APPLE PRESERVES. 

Pare and slice your apples; weigh them and your sugar, 
allowing a pound of crushed sugar to a pound of fruit. In 
a stone jar place a layer of apples, then a layer of sugar, 
sprinkling every layer with enough water to moisten the 
sugar; let this stand all night. In the morning, remove the 
apples; put the sirup in a kettle, adding a little more water 
— enough to cook the apples. Clarify the sugar with the 
whites of two eggs; strain it, and return to the kettle; place 
on the fire; when nearly boing hot, put in the apples; give 
them a good scald, but do not allow them to remain long 
enough to break ; remove from the sirup, place them in dishes, 
and sun them until a little tough ; return to the sirup, boil 
a short time, and sun again; then return to the sirup, and 
boil until quite clear and the sirup is thick. Flavor with 
lemons sliced, or with ginger. Seal tight. 

CRAB-APPLE PRESERVES. 

Boil in clear water until the core can be easily removed. 
12 



178 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

A small tin tube is the best arrangement for taking out the 
cores. Make a sirup, allowing two pounds of sugar to one 
pound of fruit; put in the fruit and boil until clear; sun a 
short time, and boil again. 

PEAR PRESERVES. 

To one pound of pears put three quarters of a pound of 
sugar. Peel and quarter your fruit; then drop into the boil- 
ing sirup. After boiling awhile, take out and put in the sun ; 
then put in the sirup some race ginger, or cloves if liked ; 
return the fruit to the boiling sirup, and boil until done. 

PLUM PRESERVES. 

Have the plums nearly ripe ; allow a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit. Put the plums in a kettle of cold water, and 
let it heat gradually until it boils; pour off this water, and 
do not use it, as it will impair the flavor of the preserves. 
Make a sirup of the sugar and enough water to cook them in. 
When the sirup has boiled a few minutes put in the fruit, 
and let it boil until done. 

QUINCE PRESERVES. 

Pare and core the quinces, taking out the defective parts; 
cut in halves or quarters; place them in a preserving-kettle, 
with enough water to cover them; lay a plate over the top 
to keep in the steam, and boil until tender. Take out the 
fruit; strain the liquor, and retain it to make your sirup of, 
allowing a pound of sugar to the same of fruit. The weight 
should be taken before boiling the fruit. When the 3irup 
has boiled twenty minutes, and been well skimmed, put in 
the quinces, and boil half an hour.. Take them up, lay on a 
dish, and expose to the sun for an hour; then return the fruit 
to the sirup, and boil until done. 



PEESER VES AND JELLIES. 179 

QUINCE MARMALADE. 

Wash and quarter the quinces, taking out the cores, but do 
not pare ; put them in a kettle with sufficient water to stew 
them in; boil until soft; run through a sieve, and to each 
pound of this pulp put a pound of sugar. Eeturn to the 
kettle, cook slowly, and stir constantly until done. 

WATER-MELON PRESERVES. 

To a bucket of cold water add two handfuls of lime. Cut 
your rinds, either water-melon or cantaloup ; let it remain in 
the lime-water twenty-four hours, turning it often from the 
bottom. Take out of the lime-water, and soak in clear water 
to remove the lime, changing the water frequently. Scald 
in strong alum-water, with grape or butter bean-leaves, keep- 
ing the vessel well covered that the rind may have a good 
green color. Let them boil in this about ten minutes; then 
drop the rind in cold water; boil in a strong ginger-tea, 
making enough to cover the rind well, and long enough to 
impart a flavor of ginger to the rind. Make a sirup, using 
two pounds of white sugar to one pound of rind, and water 
sufficient to boil the rind until perfectly transparent.. Do 
not put in the fruit until the sirup boils; then cook slowly. 
The rind should be weighed as soon as cut. Sliced lemon is 
a great improvement; when not at hand, the oil of lemon 
may be used, but not until the preserves have been taken 
from the fire — while hot. 

PEACHES PRESERVED IN THEIR JUICE. 

Wash, wipe, and pare with a silver or fine steel knife ; halve, 
and remove the pits ; to each pound of the fruit use one half 
pound of the best loaf-sugar. Sprinkle a little sugar in a 
deep earthen bowl; then put in a layer of peaches; alternate 
with sugar until all are closely packed, covering the top with 
sugar, cover tightly, and set aside for ten or twelve hours. 
Pour all into a preserving-kettle ; let them come to a boil, and 



180 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

as fast as the pieces swell sufficiently take out with a silver 
spoon and place in a glass, air-tight, preserving-jar. As soon 
as the jars are filled, pour the boiling sirup over the peaches, 
filling the jars to the top ; seal at once, 

1 have kept peaches and other fruit prepared in this way 
perfectly good three and four years. 

PEACHES PRESERVED WHOLE. 

Take the large, white clingstones; pare evenly; to every 
pound of fruit allow a pound of powdered loaf-sugar ; place 
them in large earthen tureens, — a layer of fruit, and one of 
sugar ; let them remain over night ; then boil over a gradual 
fire until transparent; then pour the fruit and sirup into large 
dishes; place them in the sun until the sirup is almost a jelly 
and the fruit well cooked; put them in jars. See that no 
bubbles of air are left in the jars. Place a brandy paper on 
the top. Seal carefully. 

BRANDY PEACHES. 

Select ripe peaches, but not soft ; drop in lye or soda-water 
to remove the furze, and wipe with a coarse towel. Make a 
thick sirup, allowing a half pound of sugar to one of fruit, 
and one half pint of water. Put the peaches in the sirup, 
and boil five minutes. After taking the fruit out, if the sirup 
is too thin add more sugar, and boil until a thick sirup is 
made. Put the peaches in a jar, and to a measure of sirup 
put a measure of brandy, ond pour over the fruit. 

PEACH-CHIPS. 

Take ripe peaches; peel, and cut from the seed. Make a 
thin sirup; boil the peaches in this until they look clear; 
then lay them on a sieve to drain ; roll in dry brown sugar, 
and expose to the sun in dishes; change to dry dishes, and 
dip in sugar again until entirely dried and crystallized. The 
sirup may be kept and used for more peaches. 



PEESER VES AND JELLIES. 181 

PEACH-LEATHER. 

Prepare the peaches as you would to eat with milk; then 
strain through a sieve ; butter panes of glass and spread it 
out thin on them, and put in the sun. The second day turn 
it. 

PUMPKIN-CHIPS. 

Weigh equal quantities of sugar and pumpkin cut thin or 
shaved with a plane ; sprinkle the sugar over the pumpkin, 
and let it remain over night. It will not need any water. 
To every pound add one orange or lemon cut into thin slices. 
Some prefer ginger as a flavoring. Boil until the pumpkin 
is perfectly clear, and the orange-peel is soft; take all out, 
and lay on a dish in the sun for half an hour ; boil the sirup 
quite thick; then put the preserves back. 

WATER-MELON OR CITRON PRESERVES. 

Pare the rinds, and soak in salt-water one night, then in 
clear water until all the 3ak is extracted ; then scald in alum- 
water, with grape or butter- bean leaves, and a lump of alum 
the size of a hickory-nut; then throw in cold water; boil in 
clear water; then boil in ginger-tea. Make a sirup, allowing 
one pound of sugar to a pint of water. When the sirup 
boils, put in the fruit, and cook until tender and transparent ; 
then take out the fruit, and boil the sirup until thick. The 
above is for ten pounds of fruit. 

CANTALOUP PRESERVES. 

Select sound fruit; pare, and divide into quarters, and cut 
each quarter into several pieces ; take the seeds out carefully ; 
weigh the fruit, and to every pound allow half a pound of 
the best loaf-sugar. Put the fruit in a preserving-kettle, and 
boil in water for half an hour, or until quite clear; drain, 
and place them on a large dish ; put the sugar into the ket- 



182 'GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

tie, and add water enough to dampen the sugar; boil until 
quite clear; then add the fruit, and boil slowly until it be- 
comes almost transparent, and soft enough to allow a straw to 
pierce through without breaking. A few lemons sliced and 
boiled with the fruit in the sirup, and a few ginger-roots 
added to the sirup while boiling, will improve the flavor. 
Put the fruit in jars, and pour the boiling sirup over it. 

SOUR-ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Hasp the orange on a vegetable grater to remove the deep 
yellow. Then peel the oranges; quai'ter the peel, and boil 
until tender enough to pierce with a straw. While boiling, 
change the water three or four times, using each time boiling 
water. G-et all the pulp and juice free from the skin; pour 
over the seeds a pint of boiling water, and let it stand until 
jelly-like; pour this off, and save; pour more water on the 
seeds until all the jelly is extracted. Cut the peel into straw- 
like strips; weigh the peel, pulp, and jelly- water, and to each 
pound of this allow a pound of sugar. Boil all until jelly- 
like. 

ORANGE-PEEL PRESERVES. 

Put the peel in salt-water for twenty-four hours; then soak 
in clear water; boil in weak alum-water, then in clear water. 
Make a sirup of a pound of sugar to the same of peel, and 
boil until clear. 

SCOTCH-ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Take large, ripe oranges, and weigh them, and to each 
pound of fruit allow one pound of crushed sugar. Pare off 
the yellow rind of half the oranges, and put it over the fire ; 
cover tightly, and let it simmer slowly until tender. Grate 
off the yellow rind of the remaining oranges; quarter the 
fruit, squeeze out all the juice and pulp, a'nd remove the seeds 
and skin. To each pound of sugar add half a pint of cold 



PRESER VES AND JELLIES. 183 

water, and the white of one egg to every two pounds of su- 
gar; let the sugar stand until nearly dissolved; then boil 
slowly, and skim off what rises. Pound the boiled parings 
in a mortar, or chop them very fine, and turn into the sirup 
after it has become very thick; then boil ten minutes, stirring 
often; put in the juice, pulp, and grated rind, and boil for 
half an hour, or until transparent. Lemons can be mixed 
with the oranges — one to every fifteen — and a little more 
sugar added with good effect. 

This recipe makes the famous Scotch marmalade used so 
much for a breakfast dish. It is sold in all large groceries in 
cities, but can be made at home at much more reasonable 
rates. Try a little of it with good bread and butter for a 
dessert. dish, and you will not sigh for pie. 

PINE-APPLE PRESERVES. 

Pare and slice the fruit. Make a sirup of half a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit; when the sirup boils, put in the 
fruit, and let it remain until a little tender. Fill the jars 
with the hot fruit, and pour on the sirup. To be kept in air- 
tight jars. Prepared in this way, much of the flavor of the 
fruit is preserved. 

APPLE-JELLY. 

Wash and cut up the apples, leaving the cores ; put them 
in a kettle with enough water to cover; boil until tender; 
then strain through a flannel bag. If the apples are very 
tart, allow one pound of the best white sugar to a pint of 
sirup; then boil until it jellies, which maybe ascertained by 
trying in a cup of cold water. In case the apples are not 
tart, allow half a pound of sugar to a pint of sirup. Two 
lemons cut up and adde 1 to the fruit while boiling will im- 
part a pleasant flavor. In general, twenty minutes will be 
long enough to boil after the sugar is added. It will be more 
economical, and the jelly will be lighter, if only a small 



184 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

quantity is boiled after the sirup is mixed with the sugar — 
say a quart at a time. 

PLUM-JELLY. 

Have your plums thoroughly ripe; put them in a kettle, 
with two pints of water to half a bushel, three pints to a 
bushel; let them boil until done, stirring all the time. When 
they have all burst they are done, and should be poured 
slowly through a sieve. After all the juice has dripped out, 
strain it through a piece of flannel. To every pint of juice 
put one pound of loaf-sugar ; put it on, and let it boil until 
it jellies. 

Take the fruit that is left, and place on the fire, allowing a 
pound of sugar to the same of fruit, or a little more weight of 
sugar ; cook until done. This will make very nice marma- 
lade. 

GRAPE-JELLY. 

Pick and wash your grapes ; put them in a kettle, and to 
six pounds of fruit put half a pint of cold water. Place the 
kettle on the fire, and steam until the grapes have yielded 
their juices; then strain, and to each pint of juice add one 
pound of loaf-sugar. Cook fifteen or twenty minutes. 

QUINCE-JELLY 

Wash and cut up the quinces, taking out the cores; boil in 
clear water until tender; strain through a flannel bag, and 
to each pint of the liquid allow a pound of loaf-sugar. Boil 
until done.

When cool enough to handle, turn it up and bleach on a can- 
dy-hook ; when white, take off and spread it out on the mar- 
ble, and sprinkle the blanched almonds all over it ; fold it up, 
and spread out again with more almonds. Continue work- 
ing it over the same way until ail the almonds are worked 
in ; then form into a long bar, and cut up in square pieces. 



CATCHUP, SAUCES, AND PICKLES. 189 



CATCHUP, SAUCES, AND PICKLES. 



VINEGAR. 

To eight gallons of water add one gallon of molasses and 
a half gallon of spirits. Put into a cask, shake well a few 
times, then add a pint of good yeast, or two yeast-cakes' 
Keep in a warm place ; in ten days slip a sheet of brown pa- 
per — which has been rolled up and dipped in molasses — into 
the bung-hole of the barrel. Cover the bung-hole with a 
piece of muslin until the vinegar is good ; then close it with 
a cork. 

EXCELLENT VINEGAR. 

Take four gallons of rain-water, one gallon of Louisiana or 
Florida sirup, and two yeast-cakes three inches square. 
Put these together in a jar. Do not exclude the air while 
fermentation is going on. A little sunshine on it will hasten 
the making of the vinegar. 

SPICED VINEGAR. 

To four gallons of strong vinegar add one pound of ginger, 
one dozen cloves, one ounce each of mace, nutmeg, black 
pepper, allspice, and red pepper ; also, a little turmeric, and 
one pound of grated horse-radish. The spices should be 
ground and inclosed in a muslin bag. It is better to make 
your spiced vinegar and keep it on hand ready for pickles, 
as it improves from standing. Prepare pickles in the usual 
way, and pour this vinegar over them. Pickles keep better 
when the vinegar is not boiled.

vinegar that has had added to it, a pound of sugar to the 
gallon, and boiled. Put sticks of cinnamon and some cloves 
in the jar. 

SWEET PICKLED FIGS.— No. 2. 

Gather five quarts of figs, with stems. Let them be only 
half ripe. Put them in salt-water, and let them stand twelve 
hours. Dry them, then parboil in alum-water, using a piece 
of alum half the size of a nutmeg. Be careful not to let them 
break ; when soft, take them out and wash in three buckets of 
clear water, to take the alum out. Dry them well. Make a 
sirup with a pint of sti-ong vinegar, a very little water, and a 
pound of sugar. Flavor with mace and cloves. When the 
sirup has boiled well put the figs into it. Use glass jars. 
These pickles will keep for years. 

SWEET PICKLED PEACHES. 

Eemove the skin from the peaches by making a mixture 
of boiling water and concentrated lye. Put in the peaches 
and let them remain until the rough skin begins to dissolve. 
Have ready a pan of cold water to drop them in ; wash them 
thoroughly, then put them on dishes to dry. To each pound 
of peaches use one quarter of a pound of sugar, half a pint of 
white wine vinegar, two ounces of allspice, and one ounce

OIL MANGOES. 

Gather the melons a size larger than a goose-egg; cut a 
slit from the stem to the blossom, and take the seed carefully 
out; fill them with salt and let them remain two weeks, 
turning them over frequently. Then wash them in cold 
water two or three times, to remove all salt, and spread on 
dishes to dry. Stuffing. — Wash one pound of white ginger 
in boiling water; when soft, slice thin one pound of grated 
horse-radish, one pound of onions chopped fine, one pound 
of white mustard-seed, one ounce of mace, one ounce of nut-

of a pound of dry mustard and a large cupful of olive-oil. 
Put a clove of garlic in each melon ; sew the melons up after 
stuffing, and pack in jars with the caps up. Strew some of 
the stuffing over each layer of mangoes, and cover with cold 
vinegar, adding another cup of olive-oil. Notice at intervals, 
and if needed add more vinegar. They should be kept in a 
dry place, and closely covered.

which a piece of alum the size of a hickory-nut has been 
dissolved ; cover them closely with more leaves ; simmer 
slowly until the cucumbers are green. Drain the cucumbers. 
To every fifty allow four quarts of vinegar, one ounce each of 
ginger, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, black pepper, celery-seed, 
and a few small onions. Boil the vinegar and spices to- 
gether, pour over the cucumbers boiling hot, and simmer a 
few minutes.

BEVERAGES. 



TO PREPARE COFFEE.— No. i. 

Pick over the grains to remove all imperfect ones; wash, 
drain, and dry. Parch always on top of the stove, stirring 
constantly. In this way it is done rapidly and evenly. 
When a good brown, and just after taking off the stove, be- 
fore emptying from the pan, stir in a table-spoonful of butter; 
this quantity to two or three pounds of coffee. 

TO PREPARE COFFEE— No. 2. 

Scald the green coffee, and dry in the oven ; leave in till 
parched a good brown. When done, have the whites of one 
or two eggs beaten to a stiff froth ; stir in the coffee, and set 
back in the oven a minute to dry. Parched coffee should al- 
ways be kept in a close can or jar. 

HOW TO MAKE COFFEE. 

To every half pint of water allow one table-spoonful of 
ground coffee. Do not grind too fine, either for boiled or 
dripped coffee. 

TO MAKE TEA. 

First scald the tea-pot with boiling water. Allow a tea- 
spoonful of tea for each person, or each half pint of water. 
After putting the tea in the tea-pot, only pour on a little of 
the boiling water at first; allow to steep a few minutes, and 
then pour on the balance of the water. 



202 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

Hot or iced tea is best made of mixed tea — equal quantities 
of black and green. 

CHOCOLATE.— No. i. 

Mix two heaping table-spoonfuls of chocolate to a smooth 
paste with water. Stir in half a pint of water, and allow to 
boil five minutes; then add half a pint of milk. Serve hot. 

CHOCOLATE.— No. 2. 

Dissolve two squares of Baker's chocolate in a cupful of 
hot water; beat well the yelks of four eggs with six table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, and mix in the chocolate. Have boiling 
a quart of new milk; stir the mixture in the milk, and let 
boil a few minutes till it thickens. Serve very hot, and on 
the top of each cup lay a spoonful of the whites of the eggs 
beaten to a stiff froth. 

MILK-PUNCH.— No. 1. 

Stir in a glass of new milk one table-spoonful of white 
sugar, the same of brandy; grate nutmeg on the top. Milk- 
punch is generally prepared in this way for invalids. 

MILK-PUNCH.— No. 2. 

One glass of fresh milk (must be very fresh, or it will 
curdle), one egg beaten very light, with one table-spoonful 
of sugar. Mix with the egg and sugar one table-spoonful of 
brandy ; pour on the milk, and grate nutmeg on the top. 

HOT MILK-PUNCH. 



Beat together, very light, the yelks of two eggs and two 
table-spoonfuls of sugar ; add two table-spoonfuls of sherry 
wine or brandy, and pour over all one pint of boiling fresh 
milk, and grate nutmeg on it. Drink as hot as possible. 

CREAM NECTAR. 

Put into a porcelain kettlo three pounds of loaf-sugar, two 
ounces of tartaric acid, one quart of water ; set it on the 






BEVERAGES. 203 



fire; when warm, add the whites of two eggs beaten to a 
froth; stir it well for a few minutes, but do not let it boil. 
When cool, strain it, and add a tea-spoonful of essence of 
lemon, and bottle. Put two table-spoonfuls in a glass, fill it 
half full of cold water, and stir in one fourth tea-spoonful of 
soda. Drink while effervescing.

thin, and throw in the peel. 

EGGNOG No. i. 

To each egg allow one table-spoonful of sugar and one ta- 
ble-spoonful of brandy or whisky; beat the eggs, whites and 
yelks together ; when partially beaten, add the sugar; then 
beat till very light; add the brandy last. When the eggs 
are beaten in this way it requires more time; but they are 
not so likely to separate. For an invalid, sherry wine is a 
delicate substitute for brandy. 

EGGNOG.— No. 2. 

Allow the same proportions as above. Beat the whites and 
yelks of the eggs separately, the whites to a stiff froth. For 
about twelve eggs beat very light a pint of sweet cream, and

ty minutes; strain, and when cold put to each quart a pint 
of French brandy. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL.— No. 3. 

Fill a demijohn with blackberries perfectly ripe, and pour 
on as much whisky or brandy as it will hold; spices to the 
taste — about a handful of cinnamon, two of allspice, and a 
dessert-spoonful of cloves to a five-gallon jar. Allow it to 
stand about three weeks, after which pour off the liquor, and 
sweeten to the taste. 



206 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

BLACKBERRY OR PEACH CORDIAL. 

Nearly fill your glass jars with fresh-gathered berries, or 
peaches cut up; fill up with whisky, and let it stand six 
months or more. Pour off the whisky, mash the berries well, 
strain, and put in their juice. Put sugar into a brass kettle, 
and cover with enough water to make a thick sirup ; tie in a 
piece of muslin some mace, cloves, and any other spices you 
wish ; drop in and boil fifteen or twenty minutes. Pour into 
the whisky, and bottle.

stand two weeks ; mash and strain through a cloth ; then 
add sugar to make a thick sirup. 

SCUPPERNONG WINE.— No. I. 

To one gallon of the juice of the grape add two pounds of 
white sugar. When the sugar is dissolved, pour into demi- 
johns or kegs, reserving a small quantity to fill up the demi- 
john, which must be kept well filled and uncorked until the 
wine ceases to ferment. The best plan is to fill them every 
morning. When fermentation ceases, strain it carefully and 
bottle it, being careful not to cork it too tightly. In drawing 
it for use, be particular not to shake the bottle, or the wine 
will mix with the lees and become muddy. 

SCUPPERNONG WINE.— No. 2. 

Press the juice from the grape, and to every gallon put 
three pounds of good sugar; put into an open-mouthed vessel, 
with a thin cloth over it, and let stand three or four days ;

COMFORTS FOR THE SICK. 



" I own that nothing like good cheer succeeds. " 



Always endeavor to have the food for the sick as attractive 
in appearance as in taste. Prepare and serve in small quan- 
tities, as fresh as possible. Avoid consulting the patient as 
to what he would like to eat. Study all the peculiarities of 
the patient, and humor him whenever by so doing you do 
not interfere with the instructions of the physician. 

BEEF-TEA. 

About three pounds of lean, juicy beef cut in small pieces. 
Put in a strong bottle or wide-mouthed jar ; place the jar in a 
vessel of cold water, and put on the fire, with a weight on 
top to keep it down in the water, having previously corked 
it closely. Boil for three or four hours; pour off the tea, 
and season with salt. If desired, add one dozen allspice and 
half a dozen cloves before boiling. Any grease rising on the 
top must be carefully skimmed off. A small tin bucket closely 
covered, with a flat-iron placed on top as a weight, is an ex- 
cellent substitute for the orthodox bottle or jar, as in the old 
way the bottle is often broken by the heat just as it is ready 
to take up, and all the tea is lost. The bucket should be 
new, and very clean. 

HASTY BEEF-TEA. 
Cut up in very small pieces lean, juicy beef, and pour on 



COMFORTS FOR THE SICK. 209 

just enough cold water to prevent burning. Wutch closely 
to prevent scorching. When done, season with salt. If 
beef-tea is allowed to cool, any grease in it can be readily 
detected and taken oft". Heat only the quantity desired to 
give the patient at one time 

CHICKEN-ESSENCE. 

Take a whole small chicken or half of a large one; mangle 
it, so as to crush the bones; pour on it a pint and a half of 
cold water, and drop in three allspice. Place it over a fire, 
and notice what time it begins to boil ; allow it to continue 
boiling twenty five minutes, when the water will have ex- 
tracted all the strength of the chicken, and will be palatable 
to anybody after the addition of a very little salt. This is 
most nutritious, and has never been known to be distasteful 
to a sick person when well made and offered hot. A spoon- 
ful every hour will suffice for a very weak person, without 
other nourishment; yet it may be safely taken in larger- 
quantities, it the patient wishes it. 

CHICKEN-BROTH. 

Cut up half of a chicken, and pour on one quart of cold 
water. Place over the fire, and allow to boil slowly two 
hours. After boiling one hour, add a table-spoonful of rice; 
salt and pepper to taste. Skim carefully while boiling. 

MUTTON-BROTH. 

One pound of mutton or lamb cut in small pieces. Pour 
on this one quart of cold wSter, and allow it to boil till the 
meat falls to pieces; cover close while boiling; strain, and 
add a table-spoonful of rice and a little parsley or thyme , 
boil half an hour, stirring frequently; then add pepper and 
salt to taste, and four table-spoonfuls of milk. 

EGG-TEA. 

Beat one egg very light, with sufficient sugar to sweeten. 

14 



210 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

Pour on this a tumbler of boiling water and a wine-glass of 
sherry or other liquor, according to taste. After adding the 
water, etc., have another vessel ready, and pour the tea rap- 
idly and repeatedly from one vessel to the other to prevent 
curdling, , Drink warm. 

SOUP MAIGRE.. 

Take of butter half a pound; put it in a deep stew-pan, 
place it on a gentle fire till it melts, shake it about, and let it 
stand till it has done making a noise. Have ready six me- 
dium-sized onions peeled and cut up small; throw them in 
and shake them about. Take a bunch of celery cut in pieces 
about an inch long, a large handful of spinach cut small, and 
a little bundle of parsley chopped fine; sprinkle these into 
the pan, and shake them about for a quarter of an hour ; 
then sprinkle in a little flour, and stir it up. Pour into the 
pan two quarts of boiling water, and add a handful of dry 
bread-crust broken in pieces, a tea-spoonful of pepper, and 
three blades of mace beaten fine; boil gently another half 
hour; then beat up the yelks of two eggs, with a tea-spoon- 
ful of vinegar; stir them in, and the soup is ready. The or- 
der in which the ingredients are added is very important. 

EEG-SOUP. 

One pint of water, the yelks of two eggs, a lump of butter 
as large as a big walnut, sugar according to taste ; beat them 
up together over a slow fire, gradually adding the water. 
When it begins to boil, pour it backward and forward be- 
tween the sauce-pan and bowl till quite smooth and frothy 

BEEF AND CHICKEN TEA. 

Take one pound of lean beef, one half of a hen, boned ; 
pound together in a mortar; add one fourth of an ounce of 
salt; put in a stew-pan with two and a half pints of water; 
stir over the fire till boiling. Then add carrots, onions, leeks, 
and celery, cut fine. Boil half an hour; strain, and serve. 



COMFORTS FOR THE SICK. 211 



Beef-tea and broth should not be kept hot, but heated up 
as required It may be warmed, but never prepared in the 
sick-room, for nothing sets an invalid against food as much 
as cooking. 

NUTRIENT ENEMA. 
Take of beef-tea half a pint, and thicken it with a tea- 
spoonful of tapioca. Reduce one and three fourths ounces 
of raw beef to a fine pulp, pass it through a fine colander, 
and mix the whole up with twenty grains of acid pepsin and 
a dessert-spoonful of malt flour. It should have a bright rose 
tint, and exhale a rich meaty odor. Not more than a quarter 
of a pint should be used at a time, and that slowly. Thus 
frequent repetition is facilitated. If the pepsin and malt are 
not at hand, the other portion of the liquor may be adminis- 
tered alone. 

ANOTHER EGG-TEA. 

Beat the yelk of one egg with a dessert-spoonful of sugar; 
add a spoonful of brandy, stirring all the time. Grate in a lit- 
tle nutmeg, and pour on half a pint of boiling milk. 

EGGNOG. 
One egg well beaten with a dessert-spoonful of sugar; 
add one table-spoonful of brandy or wine and half a cup of 
cream. 

ICED EGG. 

Beat very light the yelk of one egg, with, a table-spoonful 
of sugar; stir in this a tumblerful of very finely-crushed ice ; 
add a table-spoonful of brandy and a little grated nutmeg. 
Beat well together, and drink immediately. 

BLANC-MANGE. 

Two table-spoonfuls of corn-starch thoroughly beaten with 
one egg. Stir this into a pint of milk when nearly boiling ;

add a little salt, sugar, and flavoring to taste. Boil a few 
minutes, and pour into a mold to congeal. To be eaten with 
cream. 

BREAD-PUDDING.— No. i. 

Take of crumbs of bread two ounces, one third of a pint 
of new milk boiling hot ; pour the hot milk on the bread, 
and let it stand about an hour covered up ; then add the yelk 
of an egg well beaten ; then a tea-spoonful of rose or orange- 
flower water, a little nutmeg, and half an ounce of sugar. 
Beat all up together. Tie up and boil, or steam, or bake 
three quarters of an hour. 

BREAD-PUDDING.— No. 2.

let it stand covered up till it has soaked up the milk. Tie 
lightly in a cloth, and boil twenty minutes. 

HARTSHORN JELLY. 

Boil half a pound of hartshorn shavings (not "raspings," 
which are adulterated with bone-dust), or an equal weight of 
ivory turnings, in three pints of water down to a pint; strain, 
and add three ounces of white sugar-candy and an ounce of 
lemon-juice. Heat up again to the boiling-point. As a va- 
riety in flavoring, white capri, moselle, or champagne may 
be used in quantity not exceeding two table-spoonfuls. 

ARROW-ROOT. 

Stir, into a pint of boiling milk a large table-spoonful of 
arrow-root well mixed with a little cold milk; boil it three or 
four minutes. Sweeten to taste, and flavor with nutmeg. 

ARROW-ROOT JELLY. 

Put into one pint of boiling water two table-spoonfuls of 
arrow-root previously dissolved in a little water; boil a few

or thirty minutes. Sweeten to taste; add a wine-glass of 
sherry, and set aside to congeal. 

CUSTARD AND TOAST. 

Beat together till very light one egg and a dessert-spoonful 
of powdered sugar; pour on this a cup of boiling milk, and 
stir till thick. When done, pour into a dish over a' slice of 
toasted bread. Grate on a little nutmeg. 

TOAST-WATER. 

Cut about a quarter of a pound of bread in thin slices, and 
toast an even brown, being careful not to burn. Put into a 
pitcher, and pour on three pints of boiling water. Cover till 
cool, and strain into another pitcher. Do not allow the toast 
to remain in the water after it is cold. 

GRUEL. 

Allow two table-spoonfuls of meal to one pint of water. 
Pour the water, cold, on the meal, a little at a time, stirring 
constantly to avoid lumps. When well mixed, boil one or 
two minutes; add salt to taste, and, if desired, sugar. Strain- 
ing after it is boiled is a decided improvement. Gruel made 
with milk instead of water is more nourishing and palatable. 

BARLEY WATER. 

Wash a table-spoonful of pearl-barley through several 
waters till perfectly clean, and put it in a jug or pitcher. 
Pub several lumps of sugar on a lemon to absorb all the oil, 
and throw into the jug with the barley. Peel the lemon, 



214 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

leaving as little of the white pulp on the rind as possible; 
put this also into the jug, and pour on boiling water till the 
vessel is full. In half an hour it is ready for use. This is a 
palatable beverage. 

FLAXSEED TEA. 

Put a tablespoonful of flaxseed in a pitcher, and pour on 
one pint of boiling water ; let stand till it thickens, and strain.

should be drank warm for colds or fevers, but cold and with- 
out the lemon-juice for bowel complaints. 

SLIPPERY-ELM WATER 

Is prepared by putting the bark in cold water, and allow- 
ing it to stand till it thickens; sweeten to taste. Benne-water

it boil one minute. Take from the fire, and let stand until 
the curd has settled ; then pour off the whey, and sweeten it 
with loaf-sugar. Lemon, vinegar, and alum whey are made 
in like manner. 

GUM-ARABIC WATER. 

Take one ounce of gum arabic, and pour on it a pint of 
boiling water; stir while dissolving; sweeten to taste. The

hot water to make a pleasant drink; sweeten to taste. When 
cold, it is ready for use. 

BOILED FLOUR. 

Tie tightly in a close linen cloth one pound of flour. After 
tying, moisten with water, and dredge well with flour till a 
coating is formed to prevent the water entering the flour. 
Boil four or five hours, and let the flour remain tied in the 
cloth until it is cold. It will be a hard, solid lump, and is a 
substitute for arrow-root. Prepare by grating. Excellent in 
diarrhea or other bowel affections. 

DIET FOR INFANTS. 

Ms Prepared by Dr. J. F. Meigs.) 

Dissolve a piece of gelatine an inch square in half a gill 
of warm water; when dissolved, add a gill of milk; put on 
the fire, and when boiling add half a tea-spoonful of arrow- 
root or boiled flour-ball. When sufficiently boiled, take off 
the fii*e, and stir in two table -spoonfuls of sweet cream. This 
may be given to very young infants ; and as they grow older 
the food may be made stronger by using more milk and 

cream. 

PANADA. 

Toast nicely a slice of bread, and pour over it a h«t brandy 
toddy ; grate over it nutmeg. 

ANOTHER PANADA

of water ; boil without stirring till they mix and turn smooth ; 
then add a grate of nutmeg, a small piece of butter, a table- 
spoonful of sherry, and sugar according to taste. 

RICE FLUMMERY. 
Take rice in proportion to the quantity required; put it in 



216 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

a broad pan; cover with water; stir up together, and let 
stand twelve hours. Then pour off the water as long as it 
runs clear. Add fresh water, mix, and let stand twelve hours 
more. Repeat the same process a third time. When the 
rice has thus been macerated thirty-six hours, strain it through 
a hair- sieve and boil it, stirring it vigorously till it is quite 
thick. Pour it in a dish to cool, and eat it cold, vvith milk or 
a little wine and sugar. 

CRACKER AND CREAM 

A nicely-toasted cracker, with sweet cream poured over it, 
is delicate and nourishing for an invalid. 

TAPIOCA. 

Soak over night two table-spoonfuls of tapioca in two cups 
of water. In the morning, add .one pint of milk, sugar to 
taste, and a pinch of salt; simmer till soft, stirring frequent- 
ly. When dished, add a table-spoonful of wine, and grate 
over a little nutmeg. 

• LEMON-JELLY. 

One half box of gelatine dissolved in three gills of warm 
water, with a good half pint of loaf-sugar. Squeeze and 
slice two lemons, extracting the seeds, in three gills of water, 
and boil till the lemons are soft or their strength is extracted. 
Mix this with the gelatine and sugar, and strain ; set aside 
to congeal. To be eaten with cream. 

" SOFKY." 

To a quart of well-washed, well-beaten hominy put a gal- 
lon of cold water; keep it boiling steadily but slowly until 
the hominy begins to get soft. Then add good strong lye, 
sufficient to discolor a silver spoon when the mixture is stir- 
red with it. Mash the hominy with a spoon or roller, and 
let boil half an hour; then the liquor will be as thick as 
gruel. Take it off. and when you serve the liquor to the pa- 



COMFORTS FOR THE SICK. 0^7 

tient, add salt, sugar, milk, or wine. Do not mix or 'flavor 
more than the patient can eat at once, or about a tea-cupful. 
The lye should be made fresh from good wood-ashes. " Big 
hominy" should be used for making sofky, not grits. 

ALKALINE DRINK. 

Cut the rind of a lemon very thin, and put it in a jug with 
a table-spoonful of powdered sugar-candy. Pour on it a lit- 
tle boiling water, and, when it is dissolved, half a pint of 
Vichy water and half a pint of common water.

the stalks and washed clean, one ounce of sugar, quarter of 
an ounce of the outer rind of lemon-peel finely pared from 
the white; put them in two pints of boiling water; let them 
.stand near the fire half an hour; then strain. When the 
sage is dried, it must be used in rather less quantity than 
above mentioned. 

In the same manner, teas may be made of rosemary, balm, 
southern-wood, etc., and are convenient to prevent a thirsty 
patient taking too much tea and coffee when not good for 
him. The use of acid is also avoided. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Boil one pound of potatoes with their jackets on till they 
are tender or brittle; peel therh, and rub them through a fine 
sieve. When cool, add a small tea-cupful of fresh cream and 



218 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

a little salt, beating the -puree up lightly as you go on till it is 
quite smooth, and warming it up gently for use. 

POTATO SURPRISE. 

Scoop out the inside of a sound potato, leaving the skin; 
attached on one side to the hole as a lid. Mince up fine the 
lean of a juicy mutton-chop, with a little salt and pepper 
put it in the potato, pin down the lid, and bake or roast. Be- 
fore serving (in the skin), add a little hot gravy, if the mince

and bottle. Shake well before taking. Dose : A table-spoon- 
ful when the cough is troublesome. 

ANOTHER 

One ounce of elecampane and one ounce of comfrey-root 
soaked in one quart of water ; boil to a pint. Strain and add 
one pint of molasses or honey, and thin with one pint of 
good whisky. Boil one stick of licorice with it. When done, 
add half an ounce of sirup of squills, and half an ounce of

and flax-seed. Simmer all together in one quart of water, 
until the strength is entirely extracted ; then strain and add 
one pint of molasses and half a pound of white sugar. Sim- 
mer all well together. When cold, bottle and cork tightly. 
This sirup is excellent for any bad cough. 

REMEDY FOR CROUP. 

A tea-spoonful of powdered alum, mixed with twice the 
quantity of sugar. Give as quickly as possible. This affords 
almost instantaneous relief. 



MEDICINAL. 221 



FOR HOARSENESS. 

To a pint of whisky put as much rock-candy as it will dis- 
solve. Dose : A tea-spoonful at a time. 

GARGLE FOR SORE THROAT. 

Make a tea of red-oak bark, with a little alum dissolved 
in it. 

ANOTHER. 

One tea-spoonful of chlorate of potash, dissolved in a tum- 
bler of warm water, is an excellent gargle. Swallowing a 
little of the mixture occasionally will be beneficial. 

ANOTHER. 

Make a strong sage-tea, and add one tea-spoonful of borax 
and one of alum. Make very sweet with honey. 

ANOTHER REMEDY. 

Take old bacon, roll it full of salt, and bind it on the 
throat. It will take all the inflammation out. Use alum- 
water to gargle the throat. If you have no bacon, mix lard 
and salt together, spread it on a flannel cloth, and apply to 
the throat. 

BINKERD'S SALVE FOR BURNS. 

Take of yellow wax, melted and strained, three ounces 
linseed-oil, raw, one and a half pints; tannic acid, half an 
ounce; bicarbonate bismuth, one dram; powdered opium, 
one scruple; carbolic acid, thirty drops. Take a common 
fruit-can, not oxidized, cleanse it thoroughly, melt the wax 
in it, then add the oil, keeping it very liquid by heat, stir- 
ring it vigorously all the while. After all the oil has been 
poured in, stir it for five or ten minutes; then set it off to 
cool, agitating it as before. When it begins to chill, add the 
tannic acid; later, put in the bismuth, opium, and carbolic 



222 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

acid. The quantity of oil must depend on the season ; less 
in summer and more in winter. 

FOR BURNS. 

Great relief is sometimes afforded in case of a burn by 
sprinkling thickly with carbonate of soda, and laying over 
this a soft linen cloth, saturated with water. 

Linseed-oil and lime-water, mixed in equal quantities, are 
also excellent for a burn. 

DR. W. H. PANCOAST'S LINIMENT. 

Camphor, one and a half dram; olive-oil, one ounce; aqna 
ammonia, one ounce ; tincture aconite root, one ounce ; oil 
origanum, one half ounce; laudanum, one half ounce.

goric, one tea-spoonful of sup. carbonate of soda, well mixed. 
Dose : From ten to fifteen drops. 

HEADACHE. 

To cure a simple headache, immerse the feet in hot water 
and keep them there for twenty minutes. If the pain is se- 
vere, add two table-spoonfuls of dry mustard, keeping the 
water as hot as can be borne. 

Sick-Headache. — Two tea- spoonfuls of finely-powdered 
charcoal, drank in a half tumbler of water, will often give 
relief, when caused by superabundance of acid in the stom- 
ach. 

TO STOP VOMITING. 

A mustard plaster ; ' or a warm plaster made of toasted 
bread dipped in brandy, with nutmeg grated over it ; or a 
plaster made of all the spices pounded, and moistened with 
brandy ; either of these applied to the chest, will generally 
give relief. A julep made very strong with bruised mint is 
also good. 

ANOTHER. 

A tea-spoonful of carbonate of soda, a table-spoonful of 
spirits of lavender, in half a goblet of water. Take a spoon- 
ful frequently. 



224 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



TO STOP BLEEDING. 

At the Nose. — Fold a piece of paper about as thick as 
your little finger, and about two inches long, and place be- 
tween your lips and gums, just under the nose. Keep it 
pressed tightly there by holding your finger on your lip, and 
it will generally relieve in a short time. 

At a Wound. — Mix equal parts of wheat flour and com- 
mon salt, and bind on with a cloth. 

ANOTHER. 

Take the fine dust of tea, or the scrapings of the inside of 
tanned leather, and bind it close upon the wound. After 
the blood has ceased to flow, laudanum may be applied ad- 
vantageously. 

FOR SPRAINED ANKLE. 

Make a poultice of flour and vinegar, of the consistency of 
pudding-batter, and bind on the ankle; keep wet with vine- 
gar, renewing when dry. Sit with the foot elevated. 

CURE FOR EARACHE. 

Take a bit of cotton batting, put upon it a pinch of black 
pepper; gather it up and tie it; dip it in sweet-oil, and in- 
sert it in the ear. Put a flannel bandage over the head to 
keep it warm. It will give immediate relief. 

ANOTHER. 

Take an onion and roast it well; pour on it a little lauda- 
num and sweet-oil. Put a few drops of the juice in the ear, 
and stop it with wool; bind the warm onion to it. 

FOR TOOTHACHE. 
A few drops of sodique, or oil of cloves, or creosote, or 
chloroform, on a piece of cotton, placed in the cavity of the 
tooth, will generally give relief. 



MEDICINAL, . 225 



FOR NIGHT-SWEAT. 

Make a strong tea of sage; strain and sweeten to the taste. 
A tumblerful taken before going to sleep will prevent the 
sweat common to very feeble persons. 

AN EXCELLENT ENEMA. 

One quart of warm water, one cup of molasses, one cup of 
table-salt, and a table-spoonful of lard. 

FOR FAINTING. 

If a person faints, place him on the flat of the back and 
give plenty of fresh air. Do not crowd around him. 

PLASTER FOR A RISEN BREAST. 

One table-spoonful of melted bees-wax, one table-spoonful 
of linseed-oil, one table-spoonful of sassafras-oil. 

ANOTHER. 

Take equal parts of bees-wax, mutton-suet, and camphor. 

FLAXSEED POULTICE. 

To make a poultice sufficiently large for the chest or stom- 
ach, stir into about one pint of boiling water sufficient flax- 
seed meal to thicken. Boil till thick and smooth, stirring 
constantly. Pour into a swiss-muslin bag, securing the 
opening so that the poultice will not escape. Apply as warm 
as can be borne. Lay over the poultices one or two thick- 
nesses of flannel, or a piece of oil-silk, to prevent the damp- 
ness reaching the clothing, and to retain the heat. 

TO MAKE A MUSTARD -PLASTER. 

For an ordinary plaster use one part flour and two parts 

mustard — say one table-spoonful of flour and two of mustard ; 

mix with a little warm water. If wanted to draw rapidly 

use no flour, and mix with vinegar or whisky. A plaster 

15 



226 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

made of mustard alone, and mixed with the white of an egg, 
will di*aw perfectly, and not produce a blister. 

Note. — This may be the contributor's experience, but it is 
not every one's. We know and have felt whereof we speak. 
After the plaster is spread lay a piece of this muslin over it, 
so that the plaster will not come in contact with the skin. 

CURE FOR BONE FELON. 

One table-spoonful of saltpeter, one of copperas, one of salt 
pulverized, mixed with a table-spoonful salt soap, one red 
onion roasted; mash all well together, making a poultice; 
apply to the felon, and let it remain a day. If it does not re- 
lieve entirely apply another the next day. 

ANOTHER. 

Take of blue flag-root and white hellebore, cut up very 
fine, equal parts ; boil them in milk and water. Hold the 
finger in this as hot as it can be borne, about fifteen minutes; 
then lay the hot roots on the felon, and let them remain 
about one hour. Eenew the application several times, or un- 
til the pain is removed. The above recipe has been proved 
by the contributor. 

ANOTHER. 

A small Spanish-fly blister applied in the first stages of the 
felon is said to be a certain cure. 

ANOTHER. 

Bathing the felon with tincture of lobelia sometimes gives 
great relief. 

TO CURE A STY ON THE EYE. 

Apply the rotten part of an apple as a poultice to the eye. 
It is both cooling and healing, and removes the inflammation. 



MEDICINAL. 227 



ANOTHER. 

Put a tea-spoonful of black tea in a small muslin bag. 
Pour on it just enough boiling water to moisten it; then put 
it on the eye pretty warm, and keep it on all night. If the 
sty is not removed in the morning, a second application will 
effect a cure. 

TO DESTROY WARTS. 

Dissolve as much common washing-soda as the water will 
take up. Wash the warts with this for a minute or two, and 
let them dry without wiping. Keep the water in a bottle, 
and frequently repeat the washing. 

ANOTHER. 

Lunar caustic carefully applied so as not to touch the skin, 
will destroy warts. 

CURE FOR CORNS. 

Mix smoothly together a tea-spoonful of pulverized indigo, 
the same of brown soap and mutton-suet. Spread on a piece 
of kid and apply to the corn. 

ANOTHER. 

Apply a good coat of gum-arabic mucilage to the corn, 
every evening on going to bed. 

LIP-SALVE. 

Spermaceti, virgin wax, and lard, one ounce each ; balsam 
of Peru, half an ounce; six sweet almonds, six fresh raisins, 
loaf-sugar the size of a hickory- nut. Melt over the fire and 
stir constantly. Strain when melted. 

FOR CHAPPED HANDS AND LIPS. 

Melt together equal quantities of sweet-oil, white wax, 
spermaceti, and mutton-suet. 



228 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



ANOTHER. 

Take of honey any quantity, oil of sweet almonds sufficient 
to make a thin paste; rub the oil in gradually until well 
mixed. After washing the hands, and while still wet, take a 
small quantity and rub thoroughly on the parts affected; 
then wipe the hands dry. 

CURE FOR TETTER. 

One poke-root boiled to a strong decoction ; take one pound 
of the best loaf-sugar; boil with the poke-root to a thick 
sirup. Dissolve twenty grains of iodide of potash in a little 
water, and mix with the poke-root sirup. Dose : One table- 
spoonful three times a day. 

ANOTHER. 

Corrosive sublimate, one grain; oil of lavender, one dram; 
castor-oil, one dram ; alcohol, two ounces. Mix and apply 
externally. Do not let it get into the eyes or mouth. 

HAIR-TONIC. 

One half ounce tincture cantharides, tnree ounces of castor- 
oil, and one pint of alcohol. 

ANOTHER. 

One ounce of box-ax, one half ounce of gum camphor, beat- 
en up fine; pour on one pint of boiling water. When cool, 
it will be ready for use. 

ANOTHER. 

Sixty grains of quinine put into a quart of bay rum. 
GLYCERINE HAIR-TONIC. 

Glycerine, bay rum, each one ounce; tincture cantharides 
half an ounce; rose-water, four ounces; aqua ammonia, one 
fourth ounce. Mix. 



MEDICINAL. 229 

This tonic will stop the hair from falling out, will effectu- 
ally remove dandruff, and as a dressing will far surpass any 
of the pomatums or greasy preparations now in use. 

FOR BITE OF INSECTS. 
A lump of wet saleratus applied to the sting of a wasp, 
spider, or bee, will stop the pain almost immediately, and 
prevent all swelling of the part. 

ANOTHER. 

Tobacco, slightly moistened with water, and applied to the 
sting, will afford instant relief. 

ANTIDOTES FOR POISONS. 
Make the patient vomit by giving a tumbler of warm 
water with a tea-spoonful of mustard in it, and then send 
for the doctor. If if be necessary to act without the doctor, 
and the poison is arsenic, give large quantities of milk and 
raw eggs, or flour and water. If the poison is an acid, give 
magnesia and water, or chalk and water, and plenty of warm 
water besides. If it is an alkali, like potash, give vinegar 
and water, lemon juice, or some other safe acid. Always re- 
member the emetic first. If it be laudanum, strong coffee is 
a good thing to give until the doctor comes. Keep the pa- 
tient awake. 

CURE FOR COLDS IN THE HEAD. 

A snuff composed of the following ingredients: Hydro- 
chlorate of morphia, two grains; scacia powder, two drams; 
trisnitrate of bismuth, six drams. A. pinch of the powder in- 
haled through the nose five or six times a day will greatly 
alleviate a cold in the head. 

FOR A BRUISE. 
Mix sweet-oil and laudanum in equal quantities and apply 
to the bruise. It will relieve the soreness and prevent discol- 
oration.

Variety is the best culinary spice. 

Watch your back yard for dirt and bones. 

Xantippe was a scold; do not imitate her. 

Youth is best preserved by a cheerful temper. 

Zinc-lined sinks are better than wooden ones. 

GOOD YEAST-POWDER. 

Two pounds cream of tartar, one pound carbonate of soda, 
one pound of seconds of wheat; all well mixed and sifted. 
Put up in jars or tin boxes. 

PICKLE FOR BEEF. 

Six gallons of water, three pounds of brown sugar, one 
quart of molasses, nine pounds of coarse salt, four pounds of 
fine salt, one ounce of pearlash, and a small quantity of salt- 
peter. Put the meat in this mixture, and let it remain until 
the pickle becomes bloody; remove the beef, and boil the 
pickle until clear. When perfectly cold, return to the beef. 

PICKLE FOR HAM OR BEEF. 

To one hundred pounds of meat take seven pounds of coarse 
salt, four pounds of brown sugar, two ounces of saltpeter, 
one half ounce of soda, and four gallons of water. Boil and 
skim the mixture; when cold pour it upon the meat, which 
should have a weight placed on it to keep it down. 

TO KEEP EGGS. 

In order to keep well, they must be perfectly fresh when 
packed. Take a stone pot which will hold from two to three 



232 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



gallons; pack the eggs close, sharp end down ; take one pint 
of unslaked lime, one pint of salt; dissolve in sufficient water 
to cover the eggs. When cold, pour over. Be sure the eggs 
do not float. They will keep all the year. 

ANOTHER WAY TO KEEP*EGGS. 

Have a cloth bag that will hold about one dozen eggs; im- 
merse them in boiling water for any time less than half a min- 
ute, and you can keep the eggs as long as you please. 

ESSENCE OF GINGER. 

Beat in a mortar three fourths of a pound of race ginger ; 
put in a jar, and pour over it one quart of best alcohol. Al- 
low it to stand three weeks; then strain and bottle. 

VANILLA EXTRACT. 

Five vanilla-beans cut up and two bruised; pour over these 
one half pint of alcohol. Allow it to steep till the strength 
is extracted, and bottle. 

TO MAKE CREAM. 

Mix two tea-spoonfuls of flour, the well-beaten yelks of 
two eggs, one tea-spoonful of sugar; pour on gradually one 
pint of boiling water, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. 
A small bit of butter is sometimes added. For coffee, beat 
the white of an egg to a froth ; pour the coffee gradually, that 
it may not curdle. 

TO REMOVE MILDEW. 

Wet the garment; soap well; scrape common chalk on the 
place until a thick paste is formed ; expose to the hot sun. 

ANOTHER WAY TO REMOVE MILDEW. 

Take two ounces of chloride of lime; pour on it one quart 
of hot water; then add three quarts of cold water. Steep 
the linen in this for twelve hours, when every spot will be 
removed. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 233 



ANOTHER WAY TO REMOVE MILDEW. 

Darby's Prophylactic Fluid is equally efficacious in remov- 
ing mildew and some kinds of fruits-tains. 

TO RENEW ALPACA. 

Black alpacas may be restored to their first beauty by using 
a thimbleful of borax dissolved in a pint of warm water, and 
put on with a nail-brush. 

TO TAKE OUT GREASE. 

One table-spoonful of alcohol and a tea-spoonful of harts- 
horn. 

TO REMOVE STAINS FROM SILK, LINEN, OR COTTO'N. 

, Four table-spoonfuls of spirits of ammonia, four of alcohol, 
and one of salt; shake the whole well in a bottle, and apply 
with a sponge or tooth-brush. This will remove ink, paint, 
fruit or acid stains. 

ANOTHER WAY TO REMOVE STAINS. 

Chloroform will remove paint from a garment, and often 
restore the original color. 

ANOTHER WAY TO REMOVE STAINS. 

Wine or fruit stains may be easily removed fi-om table 
linen by spreading it tightly over a bucket, before soap or 
cold water is applied, and pouring upon the stained portion a 
stream of boiling water from a kettle. Repeat the operation 
if necessary. 

FOR REMOVING GREASE, STAINS, ETC. 

Two ounces castile soap, four ounces aqua ammonia, two 
drams sal soda, three drams spirits of wine, three drams chlo- 
roform. Cut the soap fine, and dissolve with the sal soda in 
one pint of water; then add another pint of cold water and 
the other ingredients. 



234 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

TO WASH COLORED RIBBONS OR CRAVATS. 

Make a strong suds of cold water and toilet soap ; wash the 
ribbons thoroughly until clean; rinse in clean soap-suds. 
Sometimes it is necessary to rinse several times, always in 
suds. When partially dry, iron carefully between cloths, 
taking care to have the ribbon perfectly smooth. If care- 
fully done, the ribbon will look as good as new. 

TO SET COLORS IN CALICO. 

To a gallon of very warm (not boiling) water in a bucket 
add half a cup of spirits of turpentine. Put in the dress, 
and see that it is well covered with the mixture; let it soak 
half an hour or more. If convenient, dry it before washing. 
Most colors are made permanent by it. 

To set blue or green, a little alum should be added to the 
above mixture. 

HOW TO CLEAN BLANKETS. 

Put two large table-spoonfuls of borax and a pint of soft 
soap into a tub of cold water. When dissolved, put in a pair 
of blankets, and let them remain over night. The next day, 
rub them out, and rinse in two waters. Hang up to dry 
without wringing. This recipe will also apply to the washing 
of all kinds of flannel and woolen goods; also of lace cur- 
tains. Use cold water invariably. 

FOR CLEANSING WOOLENS. 

One fourth of a pound of white castile soap, one fourth of 
a pound of ammonia (three ounces), one ounce of ether, one 
once of spirits of wine. Cut the soap in small pieces, and 
heat in one quart of soft water until dissolved; then add four 
quarts of water and the other ingredients. Bottle, and keep 
well corked. 

TO KEEP FLANNEL FROM SHRINKING. 

Wash and rinse in cold water, and hang in the cold, dry

air. The garment will not shrink or thicken up, but will 
continue soft and thin to the last. Never use warm water. 

POMATUM. 

One heaping table-spoonful of lard, melted ; two of castor- 
oil ; two square inches of white wax. Perfume with berga- 
mot while cooling, and stir until cool. 

A GOOD TOOTH-WASH 

Dissolve two ounces of borax in three pints of boiling 
water, and before it is cold add one or two tea-spoonfuls of 
camphor, and bottle for use. A table-spoonful mixed with 
an equal quantity of tepid water, and applied daily with a 
soft brush, purifies the teeth, prevents formation of tartar, 
and induces a healthy action of the gums. 

TO REMOVE FRECKLES. 

Fifteen grains of borax, one ounce of lemon-juice, one 
dram of rock-candy. Mix all together, shaking occasionally 
till dissolved. 

TO REMOVE TAN AND SUNBURN. 

Six drams of powdered borax, three fourths of an ounce of 
pure glycerine, twelve ounces of rose-water ; mix, and use 
daily as a cosmetic. 

ANOTHER WAY TO REMOVE TAN AND SUNBURN. 

The irritation from sunburn may be allayed by washing 
with a solution of carbonate of soda and water. 

HOW TO SAVE YOUR SHOE-SOLES. 

Melt together tallow and common rosin in the proportion 
of two parts of the former to one of the latter, and apply the 
preparation hot to the solos of the boots or shoes, — as much 
of it as the leather will absorb. 



236 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK.. 



TO STIFFEN COLLARS. 

A little gum arable and common soda added to starch gives 
extreme stiffness and gloss to shirt-bosoms and collars. 

DURABLE STOVE-BLACKING. 

By adding a tea-spoonful of pulverized alum to half a 
package of stove-polish, wet with a little water, much time 
and labor will be saved. It should be applied when the stove 
is nearly cold, and rubbed with a dry brush until it is dry 
and shiny. 

TO CLEAN A BROWNED PORCELAIN KETTLE. 

Boil peeled Irish potatoes in it. The porcelain will be 
rendered nearly as white as when new. 

TO POLISH FLAT-IRONS. 

If they are rough or smoky, lay a little fine salt on a board 
and rum them well. It will smooth the irons, and keep them 
from sticking, . 

EGG STAINS FROM SILVER. 

To remove stains on spoons, caused by using them with 
boiled eggs, take a little common salt, moisten between the 
thumb and finger, and briskly rub the stain, which will soon 
disappear. 

FOR CLEANING KNIVES. 

Rub the knife with sliced Irish potato dipped in knife-brick, 
and ordinary stains will be easily removed. 

TO CLEAN MARBLE. 

Take two parts of common soda, one part of pumice-stone, 
and one part of finely-powdered chalk; sift through a sieve, 
and mix with water ; then rub it well over the marble. Aft- 
er a few minutes, wash the marble with cold water. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 237 



SWEEPING. 

Wet the broom about once a week in boiling soap-suds; it 
will last longer and sweep better. Sprinkle a handful of 
salt on the carpet while sweeping, and it will lessen the dust 
as well as brighten the colors. Moistened cornmeal sprinkled 
on the carpet while sweeping will have the same effect ; also 
tea-leaves. 

A GOOD PASTE. 

Make a paste of flour; boil as you would starch, only for a 
longer time, so that it will be quite thick and well cooked. 
To a pint of paste add, while boiling, a table-spoonful of pul- 
verized alum. 

SEALING FOR BOTTLES. 

Nineteen ounces of resin, one ounce of bees-wax. Color 
with Venetian red. 

WHITEWASH. 

Take a clean, tight barrel, and slake one bushel of lime by 
covering it with hot water. After it is slaked, add cold water 
enough to make it of the consistency of cream, or thick white- 
wash. Then dissolve in water one pound of sulphate of 
zinc (white vitriol), and add to the lime and water, with one 
quart of fine salt; stir wefl until the ingredients are well 
mixed. This wash is pure white. If a cream-colored wash 
is desired, add half a pound of yellow ocher. 

BRILLIANT WHITEWASH. 

Take half a bushel of unslaked lime; slake with boiling 
water, covering it during the process to keep in the steam. 
Strain through a fine sieve or strainer, and add a peck of 
salt previously well dissolved in warm water, three pounds 
of ground rice boiled to a thin paste, arfd stirred in boiling 
hot, half a pound of powdered Spanish whiting, and a pound 
of clean glue which has been previously dissolved by soak- 



238 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK . 

ing it well and then hanging it over a slow fire in a small ket- 
tle within a larger one filled with water. Add five gallons of 
hot water to the mixture ; stir well, and let it stand a few 
days covered from the dust. It should be put on quite hot; 
for this purpose, it may be kept in a kettle on a portable fur- 
nace. It is said that a pint of this mixture will cover a square 
yard of the outside of a house, if properly applied. Brushes 
more or less small may be used, according to the neatness of the 
work required. It answers as well as oil-paint for wood, brick, 
or stone, and is cheaper. It retains its brilliance for years, 
and is superior to all other whitewashes, for inside or outside 
walls. Coloring-matter may be put in, and the wash made 
of any shade you like. Spanish brown stirred in will make 
it red-pink, more or less deep according to the quantity. A 
delicate tinge of this is very pretty for inside walls. Finely 
pulverized common clay well mixed with Spanish brown 
makes a reddish stone-color. Yellow ocher makes a yellow 
wash ; but chrome yellow goes further, and makes a color 
generally esteemed prettier. Green must not be used ; the 
lime destroys the color, and it tends to make the whitewash 
crack and peel off. If you desire to clean a smoked wall and 
make it white, squeeze indigo plentifully through a bag into 
the water you use, before it is stirred into the whole mixture. 
If a larger quantity than five gallons is required, the same 
proportions should be observed. 

TO DESTROY BED-BUGS. 

Take one ounce of quicksilver; beat up in the white of one 
etri;: : apply with a feather. Be careful not to let it touch 
your finger-rings, or anything metallic, as the quicksilver 
will adhere to it. 

Another method of exterminating these repulsive insects 
is to take grease melted out of salt pork, and apply with a 
feather to every place where they can hide. Some persons 
use salt-water to wash the bedstead, and sprinkle salt in the 
cracks. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 239 



TO DESTROY RED ANTS. 

Take half a pound of flour of brimstone and four ounces 
of jxttask ; put them over the fire until united; then beat to 
a powder. Infuse a little of the powder in water, and wher- 
ever you sprinkle it the ants will die or fly the place. 

COCKROACH DESTROYER, y 

Finely-powdered borax sprinkled freely in the crevices, or 
wherever the roaches are found, will exterminate them. Con- 
tinue for a few weeks, repeating the sprinkling every few 
days. It will not fail. 

COLIC IN HORSES. 
Give one table-spoonful of chloroform in one pint of gruel. 
REMEDY FOR BOTTS IN HORSES. 

Make a strong decoction of tansy leaves in hot water. 
Drench the horse with about a quart of this. In about three 
hours follow with a dose of castor-oil — a small tea-cupful. 

REMEDY FOR SICK TURKEY. 

When young turkeys seem sick or drooping, give each one 
a small pill of tar, and after this a teaspoonful of brandy or 
whisky. 

TONIC FOR CHICKENS. 

The "Douglas Mixture" is a good constant tonic, and is 
made thus: One pound of sulphate of iron, two ounces of 
sulphuric acid, one gallon of water; mix, and dissolve. 
Dose: One to two tea-spoonfuls to a pint of drinking-water 
for chickens. 

WOUNDS IN CATTLE. 

These are quickly cured by washing several times a day 
with the yelks of eggs and spirits of turpentine. 



240 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 



TO OBTAIN A LARGE YIELD OF MILK. 

Give your cow three times a day water slightly warm and 
slightly salted, in which bran has been stirred at the rate of 
one quart to two gallons of water. You will find that your 
cow will gain twenty-five per cent immediately, and will be- 
come so fond of the diet as to refuse to drink clear water un- 
less very thirsty; but this mess she will drink at almost any 
time, and ask for more. The amount of this drink given is 
an ordinary water-bucketful at each time — morning, noon, 
and night. 

TO TAKE OUT VARNISH, TAR, AND PAINT. 

Spirits of turpentine, benzine, or butter, washing out after- 
ward with butter. 

To extract resin and turpentine stains; use best alcohol. 

TO CLEAN OIL-PAINTINGS. 

The following is taken from the New York Tribune, which 
in turn copied it from The Atlantic. It can be recommended, 
as it has been tried with most gratifying results : 

Pettenkofer, of Munich, discovered the process, and was 
awarded by the king of Bavaria with a gift of one hundred 
thousand francs. 

Wash the picture gently, if it is dirty on the surface, with 
water and a sponge, and wipe quite dry with a soft cloth. 
Then take a wad of cotton-wool in each hand, one wet with 
spirits of turpentine, and one dry, and gently rub the surface 
a bit at a time with the wet cotton, and dry it with the other, 
changing the cotton as often as it gets dirty. Then get a 
a box (made of wood for large pictures; card-board will an- 
swer for very small ones,) a little larger than the stretching- 
frame, and about three inches'and a half deep. On the bot- 
tom, inside, place a layer of cotton batting or coarse blotting- 
paper half an inch thick or less, and fasten it down with 
tacks or cross strings, so that it will remain in place when 



MISCELLANEOUS. 241 



the box is inverted. Lay the picture on the floor or a table, 
face upward Saturate the cotton or paper with strong al- 
cohol, making it quite wet, but not so as to drip; and then 
turn the box upside down over the picture. Being a little 
larger than the picture each way, the box will not touch it, but 
will rest with its edges on the table or floor.- The fumes of 
the alcohol will dissolve the varnish, penetrate the old coats 
of it, and clarify the whole. 

After the first quarter of an hour, it is well to raise the 
box a little, and make sure that the paper or cotton does not 
touch the picture, and that the alcohol is not dripping or 
running down. The box is to be replaced, and left for about 
an hour. When it is lifted off again, if the surface be as 
soft and even and the varnish as clear as when just applied, the 
operation is finished. If parts are still rough or clouded, the 
spirits should be renewed, and the box put on again for half 
an hour, or an hour more, and then the picture may be left 
to dry, like any newly-varnished one. It may be stood up 
while drying, as less likely to collect dust. 



\ 



FURNITURE POLISH. 



One pint spirits of turpentine, half pint of sweet-oil, three 
table-spoonfuls of vinegar, two table-spoonfuls of flour. 

COKER'S FURNITURE POLISH. 

Twenty one ounces of alcohol, one ounce of oxalic acid, two 
ounces of gum shellac, fourteen ounces of linseed-oil. two 
ounces of white resin, two ounces of gum benzine. Dissolve 
the gums and acids in the alcohol, and let it remain twenty- 
four hours; then add the linseed-oil. 

TO REMOVE WHITE SPOTS FROM FURNITURE. 

A hot shovel held over varnished furniture will take out 

the white spots. 
16 



942 GULF CITY COOK-BOOK. 

TO CRYSTALLIZE GRASSES. 

Take one pound of the best alum, pound it quite fine, and 
dissolve it in a quart of clear water; but do not let it boil. 
Take a deep jar or pitcher, and suspend the grasses in it 
by a string from a stick laid across the top. When the solu- 
tion is milk-warm, pour it over the grasses, cover it up, and 
let it stand for twenty-four hours. Then take them out care- 
fully, and let them hang until perfectly dry. 

For blue crystals, use a saturated solution of sulphate of 
copperas in hot water. For yellow crystals, use the yellow 
prussiate of potash; for ruby, the red prussiate of potash. 

ERASIVE SOAP. 

Two ounces of aqua ammonia, one ounce of white shaving- 
soap, one tea-spoonful of saltpeter, one quart of soft water. 
This recipe is worth ten dollars annually to any family that 
will try it. The cost is trifling. 

GOOD HARD SOAP. 

Pour twelve quarts of soft water boiling upon five pounds 
of unslaked lime; then dissolve five pounds of washing-soda 
in twelve quarts of boiling water. Mix the above together, 
and let it stand from twelve to twenty-four hours for chemical 
action. Now pour off all the clear liquid, being careful not 
to disturb the sediment. Add to this three and a half pounds 
of clear grease and three or four pounds of resin. Boil this 
compound one hour, and pour off to cool ; then cut into bars. 

SOFT SOAP. 

To one pound of concentrated lye add three gallons of soft 
water. Let it stand ten or twelve hours; then boil a few 
minutes. Add thx-ee pounds of clear grease; boil until the 
mass is transparent, and all the grease has disappeared 



MISCELLANEOUS, 243 



Now add twelve gallons of soft water, boil a few minutes, 
and the soap will be ready for use. When cold it should be 
a perfect jelly. If too thick, add water until of the consist- 
ency desired.

TIHUEJ J^GOttlSr cook:, 

MICA OR CAST FRONT. .FOR WOOD. 




With the experience gained during thirty-five years in the manufacture of nearly 
ONE MILLION STOVES, 

We claim to know what the people want, and how to make a Cooking Stove suited to their 
demands, and so have brought out 

THE ACORN COOKS, 

Which we pronounce the best Stoves for the money ever made. 

We know there are many Cheaper Stoves, some made of light castings, others of poor 
iron, and again, others badly constructed and mounted These soon crack, burn out, and 
are a constant trial and a vexation. Such Stoves are not comparable with out acorn cooks, 
which are made only of new iron, and Warranted to last for 25 years. Especial atten- 
tion is invited to our Ventilated Fire-Box Bottom, Fire-Back and Oven. The Acorns 
are the only Stoves made with this admirable arrangement, to prevent the over-heating of 
the oven under the fire-box, preserve the fire-back, keep the air in the oven fresh and free 
from steam and gases, and prevent the escape of all smell of cooking. This arrangement en- 
ables us to guaranty the sweetest bread, baked most quickly and economcally. We make 
the Stoves with the plain top, in which all the peculiar advantages are secured, also with the 
New Portable Low Copper Reservoir. That can be lifted out in a moment for cleaning 
or repairing, in which ten or fifteen gallons of water can be kept constantly hot, for all the 
uses of the kitchen. The Convenience of a Low Restrvoir can not be overestimated. 
Those who have been accustomed to using the old-fashioned high reservoir know how incon- 
venient it is to raise a pailful of water high enough to .pour into them, and will welcome this 
great improvement. A Large Hot Closet, which is also made of cast iron, is attached 
underneath the Reservoir.
