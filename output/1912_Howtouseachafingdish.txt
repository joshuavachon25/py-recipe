HOW TO USE 
A CHAFING DISH 

The chafing dish is generally looked upon 
as a luxury, and its use as a passing fad. 
With a more intimate knowledge of its capa- 
bilities, this idea will vanish. In the one 
item of domestic economy — made-over dishes 
— its value is unquestioned, and should place 
it among the necessary utensils of the house- 
hold. The fact that there is no necessity for 
lighting the lamp until the last moment, and 
that it can be extinguished as soon as the 
materials are cooked, is a great factor in 
its favor, and makes alcohol really a cheap 
fuel. The left-overs of beef, mutton, chicken 
or duck may be converted in a few minutes 
into the most dainty sorts of viands. To the 
housewife, who keeps but one maid, it is 
indeed a helping hand. The Monday lunch 
or supper is quickly gotten without the use 
of stove or kitchen ; and so again on maid's 
day out, the Sunday night supper, and the 
still more fashionable twelve o'clock Sunday 
breakfast. This latter, by the way, is one of 



6 HOW TO USE A CHAFING DISH 

the most sensible of all the recent fads; a 
breakfast, being much lighter than a dinner, 
can be easily cooked in the chafing dish, 
giving both mistress and maid a day of rest. 
If the first preparations are carefully 
made, each dish will be quickly and easily 
cooked. As recipes call for butter by table- 
spoonfuls, which really means an ounce, cut 
the butter into squares of one ounce, drop 
them into ice water for a moment, and then 
with your butter paddles roll them into balls. 
Arrange neatly on a pretty little dish and 
stand in the refrigerator for use. Fill a 
small bowl with flour, another with salt. 
Have at hand a small copper, wood or brass 
tray holding all the necessary seasoning. Put 
lemon and onion juice into tiny pitchers. 
Have at hand red and white pepper, and a 
little butter dish containing a bulb of garlic. 
Group all the seasonings together in the 
pantry, that they may be readily carried to 
the table. 



THE CHAFING DISH 

A word about the chafing dish, which 
may be made of any of the common metals. 
The tin dishes in the market cost from a 
dollar to a dollar and a quarter. So far as 
cooking is concerned, they cook quite equal 
to the more expensive ones, but are small 
and unsightly. The grade beyond this is 
nickel, costing from three and a half to 
twelve dollars. A handsome dish is made 
of copper, with a wrought iron frame. An- 
other is a wrought iron frame on a pounded 
copper base fastened to a board. The frame 
holds an ordinary twenty-five cent earthen 
casserole, with a pounded copper lid. This 
is very handsome, will do good cooking, and 
costs anywhere from twenty-five to fifty dol- 
lars. The ordinary Gorham silver dish, to 
my mind, is the most perfect of all. The 
large lamp, with its three wicks, gives a solid 
flame that covers almost the entire bottom of 
the dish, which makes cooking as easy as 
over a gas stove, and enables a hostess to 
cook and serve a supper with ease. It is 



8 HOW TO USE A CHAFING DISH 

the waiting at a chafing dish supper that is 
annoying. These dishes cost from thirty- 
five to a hundred dollars, and last a life- 
time. 

An alcohol filler is a great convenience, 
and removes the danger that is always 
attended with filling a lamp from a bottle. 
Place the chafing dish on the tray, on the 
table before the host or hostess, as the occa- 
sion may demand. At serving time put all 
the necessary materials that must be meas- 
ured with a spoon on the right-hand side, 
also the butter, with an oyster fork or butter 
pick. The milk, cream, stock or water should 
be measured and put into little pitchers on 
the left. On the tray place a teaspoon and 
tablespoon for measuring, a long chafing dish 
spoon for the cooking, and a silver serving 
spoon. Perfect arrangement saves much 
time and confusion, and makes chafing dish 
cooking a pleasure. See that the lamp is 
filled and the matches at hand before you are 
seated. 

If a recipe calls for butter and flour 
rubbed together, these may be in the chafing 
dish before serving time. If the butter is 
to be melted, put it in the chafing dish before 



THE CHAFING DISH 9 

you add the flour. Use always kitchen bou- 
quet or browning for brown sauces ; it saves 
time in waiting for butter to brown, and 
makes a more wholesome and palatable 
sauce. 

The hot water pan is simply used for 
keeping materials hot in case of a second 
helping, although nine out of ten times I 
make my rarebit over the hot water pan. For 
raw meat dishes always use the blazer for 
first cooking. 



MENUS 

A Sample Menu and How to 
Prepare It 

Arrange, for instance, a menu like the 
following : 

Caviar Sandwiches 

Deviled Oysters Rolls 

Beef a la Bordelaise Peas 

Mayonnaise of Celery 

Wafers Cheese 

Coffee 

In the first preparation of this lunch the 
celery will be cut into pieces, dried, put into 
a bowl, and placed in the refrigerator. The 
mayonnaise made and also put in a cold 
place. Mix all salads at the very last mo- 
ment. Drain the oysters; throw them into 
a hot pan; stir carefully until they reach 
boiling point; drain, this time saving the 
liquor. Chop the oysters, put them into a 
bowl, and stand aside to cool. To the oyster 
liquor add sufficient milk to make a half pint. 
Turn into a pitcher, and place it with the 



MENUS II 

oysters. It is much more convenient to have 
the materials for each course grouped to- 
gether, with the exception of the butter and 
seasonings, which remain on the table. The 
beef will be either cold roasted or boiled; 
cut it into thin slices and arrange neatly on 
a plate, around which you put a half can 
of drained mushrooms. Measure the stock; 
put it in a pitcher and place it with the meat. 
Chop the parsley and put in a dainty saucer ; 
drain and wash the peas and put them in a 
bowl. 

The caviar sandwiches will be on the 
table before supper is announced; they, of 
course, are eaten with a fork. While these 
plates are being removed, the deviled oysters 
will be prepared. For twenty-five oysters 
put a tablespoonful of butter and one of 
flour in the chafing dish; mix, add the 
oyster liquor and milk. When boiling, add 
the oysters. You will have the yolks of two 
eggs slightly beaten in a small bowl ; season 
the oysters first with a half teaspoonful of 
salt, a dash of pepper, then add the yolks; 
stir carefully until smoking hot ; put out the 
lamp immediately. Sprinkle over a table- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, and serve. 



12 HOW TO USE A CHAFING DISH 

The dish will now be washed and re- 
turned, with materials for the next course. 
When the oyster course is partly disposed 
of, put two tablespoonfuls of butter into the 
chafing dish, melt, and add two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour. This time you will have a 
pint of stock that has been measured and 
put into a pitcher ready for use. Stir until 
the sauce boils, add the meat, a teaspoonful 
of kitchen bouquet, the same of Worcester- 
shire sauce. Rub your spoon lightly with 
garlic, or you may rub the bottom of the 
chafing dish before adding the butter. Cover 
the dish for a moment, and when the meat 
is smoking hot, turn in the peas. When 
these are smoking hot, serve. 

Have the celery brought in in a large 
salad bowl, the mayonnaise in another bowl ; 
mix at the table, and serve at once. In sea- 
soning salads, add seasoning to the material 
rather than to the dressing. A French coffee 
pot may be used for making the cofTee, also, 
on the table ; the entire meal is then prepared 
before the eyes of the guests. 

Menus like the following are simply and 
quickly prepared:

How to Prepare Breasts of Birds 

While these bills of fare seem elaborate 
to be cooked in a chafing dish, they can be 
easily done, provided the first preparations 
are perfect. Take the last, for instance. The 
fish will be boiled and put aside early in the 
day. The sweetbreads will also be parboiled 
and picked apart, put in a dish or bowl, ready 
for cooking. Remove the breasts from the 
birds, each half in one solid piece, allowing 
a portion of the wing bone to remain, form- 
ing cutlets. Arrange these on a long platter, 
to be brought to the table at serving time. 
To each dozen breasts (six birds) allow two 



MENUS 15 

tablespoonfuls of butter, brown slowly; add 
two tablespoonfuls of flour ; mix, add a clove 
of garlic, mashed, a teaspoonful of salt, a 
dash of red pepper, a quarter of a teaspoon- 
ful of white pepper, a half pint of stock, and 
a half pint of claret. Throw the breasts 
into this boiling sauce; cover, and cook five 
minutes. 

Another very nice way of preparing the 
breasts of birds is to first put in two table- 
spoonfuls of butter; when hot, put in the 
breasts of the birds, flesh side down; allow 
them to brown quickly; draw them to one 
side and add the flour, and proceed accord- 
ing to the above directions. If another chaf- 
ing dish is not at hand, the peas may be 
heated with the birds. 

For a quick breakfast or a simple lunch 
the chafing dish, of course, is invaluable. 
Where cold meats are served for Sunday 
night supper, the chafing dish may be used 
for the heating of peas, making of creamed 
potatoes, or heating over any vegetables that 
have been previously cooked. For the home 
breakfast it answers for omelet, scrambled 
eggs, frizzled beef, warmed-over mutton or 
chicken in brown or cream sauce. Brown

sauces are more agreeable with red meats 
or game ; white sauces with white meats, as 
poultry, sweetbreads and tripe.

All forms of soup may be reheated in the 
chafing dish. Clam bouillon simply turn into 
a pitcher and send to the table; heat in the 
chafing dish and serve in cups. You may 
add water or milk, as you like. 

One chafing dish, if used rapidly, may 
answer for two dishes for one course; for 
instance, you wish to warm cold roasted 
beef in brown sauce and also to serve 
creamed potatoes. The potatoes are cut into 
blocks and put at your left; a half pint of 
milk, measured. First heat the beef. It may 
be served a la Bordelaise in brown sauce, 
or barbecued, or with a tomato sauce. As 
soon as it is served, have the chafing dish 
washed and quickly returned. Put in the 
butter and flour; mix; add milk and, when 
boiling, the potatoes. As soon as they are 
heated (which will be not more than three 
minutes) they may be served. 



20 HOW TO USE A CHAFING DISH 

Where, however, a given amount of 
money is to be expended for a chafing dish, 
better service is received from two cheaper 
ones. Any bits of cold chicken, turkey or 
duck may be used and made into creamed 
dishes, seasoned with mushrooms and truf- 
fles, or served perfectly plain, or served with 
peas, the peas added after the chicken is hot, 
and the whole reheated. Mutton may be 
served in tomato sauce, beef in brown sauce. 
Frizzled beef may be made plain with cream 
or into a fricassee, and even with these few 
materials a dozen chafing dish lunches may 
be arranged. Where Welsh rarebit, or lob- 
sters, or crabs are served, avoid, at the close, 
a heavy sweet. Wafers and coffee, or some- 
thing like lemon jelly, coffee jelly, charlotte 
russe or plain whipped cream, should be 
served. 

At least fifty chafing dish lunches or 
suppers may be made from combinations of 
recipes given in the book. 



APPETIZERS 

Under this heading we would naturally 
place caviar, anchovy and sardine canapes 
and pickled oysters, crab, lobster and fruit 
cocktails. We would not say that any of 
these things are really wholesome. They 
are known in the cooking world as appe- 
tizers, and are nice to serve as first course 
at a chafing dish luncheon or supper. 



Caviar Canape 

Toast rounds of bread, cover them while 
warm with a thin layer of caviar, garnish 
the edge with half slices of olives, put in 
the center a saltspoonful of chopped onion, 
and dust the space between with finely 
grated hard-boiled yolks of eggs. Serve 
these on little paper doilies on small plates. 

Anchovy and sardine canapes are made 
the same, mashing them with a yolk of hard- 
boiled egg moistened with a little olive oil. 
All these appetizers are seasoned with a few 
drops of onion and lemon juice. 



22 HOW TO USE A CHAFING DISH 

Crab, Oyster and Lobster Cocktails 

Crab, lobster and oyster cocktails are all 
made practically the same. Stand a small 
tumbler into a shallow bowl of cracked ice, 
fill the tumbler half full with the tomato 
cocktail mixture, or use plain tomato catsup 
seasoned with lemon juice, a drop of tabasco, 
a dash of onion and a teaspoonful of horse- 
radish. Put in a half dozen oysters, or two 
tablespoonfuls of crab meat, or two table- 
spoonfuls of chopped lobster. 



SOUPS 



Bellevue Bouillon 

Heat an equal quantity of clam bouillon 
and chicken bouillon. Season lightly with 
salt, serve in heated cups, put a tablespoonful 
of whipped cream on the top of each, and 
dust lightly with paprika. 



Cream of Tomato 

In the morning stew a quart of tomatoes 
down to a pint; press through a sieve and 
put in a pitcher. Add to them a slice of 
onion, a half saltspoonful of mace and the 
same of white pepper. At serving time turn 
the tomatoes into the chafing dish, stir until 
they are smoking hot, add a level table- 
spoonful of butter and a half pint of good 
milk. Add a teaspoonful of salt after the 
soup is hot. Serve in cups. 



24 HOW TO USE A CHAFING DISH 

Clam Bouillon 

Turn a half pint of clam bouillon into 
the chafing dish; add a half pint of boiling 
water, a saltspoonful of celery seed and a 
dash of pepper. When hot add two table- 
spoonfuls of cream or a tablespoonful of 
butter. Serve in small bouillon or tea cups. 

Chafing Dish Pepperpot 

1 pound of honeycomb tripe 

The dark meat of one cooked chicken 

2 tablespoonfuls of chopped raw ham 
50 small suet dumplings 

2 cold boiled potatoes 

1 quart of stock 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter 
2 tablespoonfuls of flour 

I tablespoonful of chopped parsley 

I teaspoonful of salt 

I dash of cayenne 

I chopped green pepper 

I dash of tabasco 

Cut the potatoes into blocks, add them 
to the tripe, which has been cut into squares 
of a half inch. Cut the chicken into dice, 
and put them all into one bowl. This is nice 
for a simple luncheon, or may be served as 



SOUPS 25 

the one hot dish for supper. At serving time 
put the butter and flour into the chafing dish, 
add the stock and all the seasoning. When 
this is smoking hot add the tripe, chicken and 
potatoes, stir until thoroughly heated, then 
sprinkle the dumplings over the top; cover 
the dish for five minutes, and the mixture is 
ready to serve. Make the dumplings in the 
morning, but they must not be larger than 
the end of your little finger. They are 
cooked as soon as they are heated. 



FISH 



Fish Hollandaise 

1 pint of flakes of cold boiled or baked fish 
y2 pint of water 

2 level tablespoonfuls of butter 
2 level tablespoonfuls of flour 

2 tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar 
^ teaspoonful of onion juice 

2 yolks of eggs 
y2 teaspoonful of salt 

I dash of white pepper 

Put the flaked fish in a bowl dust with 
chopped parsley, sprinkle over the onion 
juice and vinegar. At serving time put the 
butter and flour in the chafing dish, mix, and 
add the w^ater. When thick and smooth, add 
the salt, pepper and fish ; cover the dish until 
the fish is thoroughly heated, then add the 
beaten yolks of the eggs, toss and serve. 



FISH 2 J 

Canned Salmon with Sauce Soubise 

1 pound can of salmon 

2 onions 

2 level tablespoonfuls of butter 
2 level tablespoonfuls of flour 
I cupful of milk 

I tablespoonful of soft breadcrumbs 
Yi. teaspoonful of salt 
I saltspoonful of white pepper 

Open the salmon ; remove the skin, bones 
and oil; break it apart with a silver fork, 
put it in a bowl and stand it aside until 
wanted. Boil the onions and press them 
through a sieve; put them in a bowl. At 
serving time rub the butter and flour to- 
gether in the chafing dish, add the milk, 
stir until boiling, add the salt, pepper, and 
work in the onion pulp. When this is hot 
and smooth, add the salmon, cover the dish, 
and when the salmon is smoking hot, serve. 

This recipe will also answer for shrimps 
or lobster. 



28 HOW TO USE A CHAFING DISH 

Kedgeree 

5/2 pint of cold cooked fish 
^ pint of cold boiled rice 

3 hard-boiled eggs 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter 
Yz teaspoonful of salt 

I saltspoonful of pepper 

I tablespoonful of chopped parsley 

Mix the rice, fish and hard-boiled eggs, 
chopped, together; put them in a bowl. At 
serving time put the butter in the chafing 
dish, add all the other ingredients, stir con- 
stantly until the mixture is thoroughly 
heated, and serve. 



Shad Roe 

I set of shad roe 

4 tablespoonfuls of butter 

Yz pint of tomato sauce 

Yz teaspoonful of salt 

Y2 teaspoonful of paprika 
I lemon's juice 

In the morning cover the shad roe with 
boiling water and stand them on the back 
of the stove where they cannot possibly boil, 
for a half hour. Drain them, and stand 
them aside to cool ; when cold, cut them into 



FISH 29 

slices. At serving time put the butter into 
the chafing dish; when liot, put in the shad 
roe ; let them cook on one side, turn and cook 
on the other. Pour over the tomato sauce, 
add the seasoning, cover the dish until 
smoking hot, and serve. 

Shad melts may be cooked and served in 
the same fashion. 



OYSTERS 

Hot Oyster Cocktail 

Allow four oysters to each person. 
Drain, wash and drain them again. Throw 
them into a hot saucepan, shake over the 
fire until the gills curl ; drain again. Put the 
liquor into a little pitcher, and the oysters 
into a bowl. At serving time put a table- 
spoonful of butter, four tablespoonfuls of 
tomato catsup, a teaspoonful of Worcester- 
shire sauce, the juice of half a lemon, a 
dash of tabasco and a half teaspoonful of 
salt, to each dozen oysters. Stir until hot, 
add the oysters, and stir in the blazer until 
the liquor almost boils, then add four or 
five tablespoonfuls of the oyster liquor, dip 
at once into cocktail glasses and serve. 
These will be eaten with an oyster fork. 

Deviled Oysters 

Drain twenty-five oysters; allow cold 
water to run over them in the colander; 
then throw them in a hot saucepan; shake 



OYSTERS 31 

until they reach the boihng point; drain, 
this time saving the hquor, to which you 
will add sufficient milk to make a half pint. 
Put two tablespoonfuls of butter and one of 
flour into the chafing dish; mix; add the 
oyster liquor and milk; stir until boiling; 
add a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of red 
pepper, a half teaspoonful of onion juice, and 
the oysters chopped ; stir until smoking hot ; 
add the yolks of two eggs slightly beaten, 
a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, and 
serve at once. This recipe may be used for 
fish, chicken or turkey, using all milk, or half 
milk and half stock for the liquid portion 
of sauce. 



Oysters and Celery 

25 oysters 

I heart of a head of celery 
3 tablespoonfuls of butter 
Yz cupful of milk 
I level teaspoonful of salt 
I dash of white pepper 
I dash of black pepper 
I saltspoonful of paprika 

Wash and drain the oysters; put them 
into a bowl. Chop the celery very fine. At 



32 HOW TO USE A CHAFING DISH 

serving time throw the oysters into the hot 
chafing dish, stir and toss until the gills are 
curled, then sprinkle over the finely chopped 
celery. Cover the dish for a minute until 
the contents are smoking hot, then add the 
butter, all the seasoning and the milk. Mix, 
cover the dish, and when smoking hot add, 
if you have it, a teaspoonful of Pekin sauce 
or soy; mix and serve. 

Panned Oysters 

Drain, wash, and drain again a pint of 
solid oysters. Light the burners under the 
blazer; do not use the hot water pan. 
Throw in the oysters and stir constantly 
with a wooden spoon until the gills have 
curled. Add tw^o level tablespoonfuls of 
butter, a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of 
cayenne and a half saltspoonful of white 
pepper. When this reaches boiling point, 
add a few drops of onion juice, stir and 
serve. 



OYSTERS 33 

Oysters and Macaroni 

2 ounces of macaroni 
25 good fat oysters 

4 tablespoonfuls of cream 
Yo teaspoonful of salt 

2 tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese 

I saltspoonful of white pepper 

Boil the macaroni or spaghetti in the 
morning. When the macaroni is tender, 
throw it into cold water; when cold, drain 
and cut it into one-inch lengths; stand it 
aside. Drain, wash, and drain the oysters 
again. At serving time light the blazer, 
throw in the oysters; when the gills have 
curled add the macaroni, milk, butter and 
seasoning. Let this boil, add the cheese, 
stir and serve. 

This is an exceedingly nice dish for 
supper or luncheon. 



Quick Curry of Oysters 

Drain twenty-five fat oysters. Have at 
hand a clove of garlic and a tablespoonful 
of chopped pepper. Put into the dish two 
tablespoonfuls of butter; when hot, not 
brown, add the oysters. Sprinkle over one 



34 HOW TO USE A CHAFING DISH 

teaspoonful of curr3% the pepper and a salt- 
spoonful of salt. Rub the spoon with the 
garlic and stir until boiling. Serve. 



Fricassee of Oysters 

Drain fifty oysters free from all liquor. 
Put them in a bowl ready for the table; 
stand this by the side of the chafing dish, 
also a cup containing yolks of two eggs, a 
butter pat and a tablespoonful of finely 
chopped parsley. In the chafing dish have 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and one of flour 
rubbed together, and half a pint of milk. 
When seated, light the lamp and stir con- 
stantly until you have a smooth sauce, then 
add oysters; bring to boil, add teaspoonful 
of salt, dash of cayenne, the yolks and pars- 
ley. Stir a minute and serve. 



Oysters a la Chamberlain 

Drain free from all liquor fifty good fat 
oysters, and put them in the chafing dish. 
Put a quarter pound of butter by the side, 
also one gill (one-half cup) of good cream. 



OYSTERS 35 

When seated, light the lamp and with a 
long wooden spoon stir carefully until the 
oysters are boiling hot; add the butter cut 
into four bits, the cream, a teaspoonful of salt 
and a dash of cayenne. Make sure the oys- 
ters are cooked, then put out the lamp and 
add two tablespoonfuls of Madeira or sherry 
— first always preferable. Serve at once 
from dish. 



Quick Oyster Pie 

In the morning bake rounds of paste, 
or use ordinary round water thins in their 
place. Drain and wash the oysters, and 
drain again; put them in a bowl. Measure 
a half cupful of milk for the small pitcher. 
Chop a half can of mushrooms. Cut into 
blocks sufficient cold boiled potatoes to make 
a cupful. You will also need a teaspoonful 
of onion juice and a tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley. At serving time put two 
level tablespoonfuls of flour and two of but- 
ter into the chafing dish; add the milk, and 
just as soon as the butter and flour are 
beginning to thicken, add the oysters. Stir 
with a wooden chafing dish spoon until the 



36 HOW TO USE A CHAFING DISH 

gills curl; add the mushrooms, mix thor- 
oughl}^, add the potatoes, mix again, then 
add the seasoning, stir carefully for a mo- 
ment, and put the lid on the chafing dish. 
When this is hot, dish it on rounds of crisp 
pastry. 

Oyster Patties 

For a luncheon or supper one may buy 
patty shells, have them placed on the table, 
make creamed oysters, and fill the shells at 
the table; in fact, this is a much better 
way for a luncheon or supper than to have 
them filled outside, as they frequently come 
in lukewarm and soft. Put two level table- 
spoonfuls of butter and two of flour in the 
chafing dish; when melted, add a half pint 
of milk, stir until you have a thick, smooth 
sauce, add a level teaspoonful of salt, a salt- 
spoonful of pepper, and twenty-five drained 
and washed oysters. Cover the dish, and 
when the ingredients are smoking hot, put 
a patty shell on a breakfast plate, fill it to 
overflowing with the mixture, and serve. 
An equal amount of parboiled sweetbreads 
or chicken blocks may be used for sweet- 
bread and chicken patties.

six tablespoonfuls of Madeira. Reduce the 
last water in which the terrapin was boiled 
with the shells and the rougher pieces, so 
that you will have what we call a ''terrapin 
stock.'' To each full count terrapin allow 
four tablespoonfuls of butter and two of 
flour; stir until slightly browned, add the 
stock and a teaspoonful of browning; bring 
to boiling point; add the terrapin. When 
thoroughly heated, add a half teaspoonful of

CHEESE 

To Make Toast on Chafing Dish 

When making Welsh rarebit at night 
after fires are fixed, it becomes necessary 
to make toast also over the chafing dish. 
Have ready a hot platter and dish of butter. 
Place over the spirit light a round asbestos 
mat, trim the bread and place it on the mat ; 
toast carefully, butter, and put it on the 
heated platter while you make the rarebit. 



Welsh Rarebit, No. i

American cheese. Rub the bottom of the 
chafing dish with a clove of garlic; put in 
the cheese, add one tablespoonful of tomato 
catsup, one of Worcestershire sauce, salt- 
spoonful of salt, dash of cayenne and two 
yolks of eggs, well beaten. Stir a moment

four tablespoonfuls of cream beaten with one 
whole tgg, a dash of cayenne and a salt- 
spoonful of salt. Stir until melted; pour 
over the crackers and serve. 



TRIPE 

As soon as tripe comes from the market, 
it should be washed and put in a saucepan 
with an onion, pepper, bay leaf and enough 
hot water to cover. Simmer for an hour, 
drain, cover with fresh boiling water, add 
fresh seasonings and simmer eight hours, or 
cook over night in a fireless cooker. When 
cool, cut into half -inch pieces, and it is ready 
to dress. 

Tripe and Oysters 

Cut a pound of well-boiled tripe into 
dice or narrow strips; drain and wash 
twenty-five oysters; put two tablespoonfuls

frequently put over the tripe first a can of 
drained and washed peas or a pint of freshly 
cooked peas, and then the rice. This makes 
one of the nicest of the luncheon and supper 
dishes, and gives practically meat and vege-

Virginia Club Supper 

This dish is a favorite one at some of 
the club houses. It makes an exceedingly 
nice luncheon or supper, and can be served 
with corn bread, which, of course, necessi- 
tates a fire. In a private house I should 
always serve it with brown bread and butter 
sandwiches ; with a lettuce salad and coffee, 
you have a complete meal.

If you have had roasted lamb or mutton, 
as soon as the meal is over cut a portion of 
that left over into cubes of a half inch. You 
may use the less attractive parts for this 
dish, saving the better parts to slice down 
cold. Put these blocks into a bowl, add a

mashed, and, if possible, a tablespoonful of 
chopped chives. Add just a suspicion of 
grated nutmeg and the same of allspice, dust 
over a little black pepper, and cover with

Mushrooms in Chafing Dish 

Have the mushrooms carefully washed; 
to each pint allow a tablespoonful of butter. 
Put the butter in the chafing dish. When 
melted, add the mushrooms, either whole or 
cut into slices, a tablespoonful of water, a 
half teaspoonful of salt. Cover the dish, 
and cook slowly for fiv^ minutes. While

of flour into a bowl; add to it gradually a 
half cup of milk or cream, or you may add 
half cream and half milk; add this to the 
mushrooms ; stir until they reach the boiling 
point, and serve at once on toast or biscuits. 

As some mushrooms are more watery 
than others, the quantity of milk may be 
decreased. The lepiota procera or Ameri- 
cana are better if they are simply cooked in 
butter, skin side down, until tender — about 
five minutes. Then add four or five table- 
spoonfuls of cream and a palatable seasoning 
of salt and pepper ; or all mushrooms may be 
cooked in butter and their own juices.

Creamed Corn 

This is another dish that is always 
better prepared at the table. After the soup 
is served, have the waitress place the chaf- 
ing dish and heat the corn while the meat 
is being carved. Throw the corn, on the 
cob, into boiling water early in the morn- 
ing, and let it come to a boil. When the 
corn is cold, score down with a scorer, or 
cut each row of grains with a knife, and 
press out the pulp. Put the pulp into a 
bowl, add a tablespoonful of butter to each 
dozen ears, a half teaspoonful of salt and a 
half cupful of good milk. Turn the mixture 
into the chafing dish, light the lamp, and

than stir them.

Put together two or three cold boiled 
potatoes, chopped, a few peas or other vege- 
tables that may be left over from dinner, 
chopped if necessary. Add to them an equal 
quantity of chopped nuts or toasted pine 
nuts, and stand them aside for supper. At 
supper time put a half cupful of milk into 
the chafing dish and light the lamp. Turn 
into this the vegetables, stir until they are 
thoroughly heated, then dust over a half 
teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of onion 
juice that you have prepared in the after- 
noon, a little pepper, and stir in a table- 
spoonful of butter. Serve at once. This 
will take the place of both meat and vegeta- 



96 HOW TO USE A CHAFING DISH 

bles for supper, and with bread and butter, 
and a salad, you have an exceedingly good 
meal. 

Fricassee of Chestnuts 

1 pint of chestnuts 

2 level tablespoonfuls of butter 
2 level tablespoonfuls of flour 

3/2 pint of stock 

2 yolks of eggs 

Yz teaspoonful of salt 

I saltspoonful of pepper 

Shell the chestnuts, blanch them and boil 
them until tender in salt water; drain, put 
them in a bowl and stand them aside. To 
give variety, now and then you can add a 
half can of mushrooms, chopped fine. At 
serving time put the butter and flour in the 
chafing dish, mix, add the stock, salt, pepper 
and chestnuts. When this is thoroughly 
heated, stir in carefully the yolks of the 
eggs, beaten with two tablespoonfuls of 
milk; dust with chopped parsley and serve 
at once. These are exceedingly nice, and 
even when you are going to serve them with 
broiled or panned chicken, they are better 
prepared in the chafing dish at the table 
than when served from the kitchen. 



VEGETABLES 97 

Stewed Bananas with Rice 

This is rather a nice dish for the noon- 
day meal for children, and can easily be 
prepared at the table. Put four sliced 
bananas, with two tablespoonfuls of butter 
and two of sugar, into the chafing dish. 
Light the lamp under the hot water pan. 
Add the juice of two oranges. Cover the 
dish, and when the bananas are smoking 
hot, sprinkle over the cold boiled rice ; when 
this is hot; serve.

Published by 

Arnold and Company 



Mrs, Rorer's 
NEW Cook Book 

A big book of 731 pages, abundantly illustrated. Its 
bigness is no criterion of its goodness. The fact that 
it is the best work of the best years of Mrs. Rorer's 
life ; that it is a complete new book telling of the things 
one needs to know about cooking, living, health, and 
the easiest and best way of housekeeping — these are 
what make for goodness, and place this book far in 
advance of any other of a like nature. 

The New Cook Book covers all departments of 
cookery. A masterly exposition of each subject is 
given, followed by recipes for the proper preparation, 
cooking and serving of the various kinds of foods. 
There are over 1500 recipes in the book. 

The illustrations are an important feature. One 
set of pictures shows the proper dressing of the table 
during a course dinner. Then there is a complete set 
showing the method of carving meats, poultry, game, 
etc.; and many others illustrating special features of 
the book.

Mrs, Rorer*s 

Philadelphia Cook Book 

This is the standard book of Mrs. Rorer's that has 
been before the pubHc for a number of years. It has 
no connection with Mrs. Rorers New Cook Book. 
Each book is independent of the other, and the posses- 
sion of one forms no reason for doing without the 
other. 

The Philadelphia Cook Book is full of good things, 
and, like all of Mrs. Rorer's works, is eminently prac- 
tical. It is a standard of excellence, in that it is 
full of the brightest things in cookery; the recipes 
are absolutely reliable, and the general instructions 
to housekeepers of the most helpful and necessary 
character. 

Nearly all cook books assume some knowledge and 
experience on the part of those who use them, but Mrs. 
Rorer makes her explanations so clear, and gives such 
definite directions, as to quantities, that the beginner 
has no difficulty in successfully accomplishing all the 
book calls for. Then there are frequent hints as to 
the proper use of left-overs, how to market, and, in 
many ways, information is given that is alike useful to 
the experienced cook as to the tyro in matters culinary. 

The book is full of choice recipes, every one of 
which has been successfully tested by Mrs, Rorer and 
found to come out right. This alone is of incalculable 
benefit and ought to commend the book to the favorable 
consideration of every housekeeper. 

The use of this book in the home means better 
health, better living, economy in the use of food, and 
a consequent saving in dollars and cents.

Mrs. Rorer^s 

Vegetable Cookery and Meat 

Substitutes 

This book has a twofold object: 

1. To show the value of vegetables in their relation to 
diet and health, how to prepare, cook and serve 
them, what to eat under certain conditions of health, 
and thus have them perform their proper work. 

2. To give to the prudent housewife a knowledge of 
combinations of foods in the shape of toothsome 
recipes to take the place of meat, or as we call 
them — Meat Substitutes. 

It goes without saying that we all know too little 
about the value of vegetables as food. We eat them 
because they are palatable, not realizing their immense 
importance as body builders. Here they are classified, 
and thus made to give us a right idea of their use. 

Then as to Meat Substitutes. It is not necessary 
to be a vegetarian to desire a change from a meat diet. 
There are health reasons often demanding abstention 
from meats; or economy may be an impelling motive; 
or a desire for change and variety in the daily bill of 
fare may be warrant enough. However we look at it 
here is the wonder book to point the way to better and 
healthier living. 

There is an abundance of the choicest and most 
palatable recipes, and they are given in such a manner, 
that if the directions are followed, the results are sure. 
You cannot make mistakes.

Mrs, Rorer*s 
Every Day Menu Book 

In the course of her teaching and editorial work, 
there have come to Mrs. Rorer frequent requests for 
a book that will provide a daily bill of fare, one that 
will be at once rational, its directions easy of accom- 
plishment, and give an excellent variety. Hence this 
Menu Book. 

It contains a menu for every meal in the year, 
systematically arranged by months and days ; menus for 
special occasions, such as holidays, weddings, luncheons, 
teas, etc. ; illustrations of decorated tables for various 
social events, with appropriate menus; menus arranged 
for the seasons both as to food and decorations; a 
department of menus without meats. A fine volume 
that ought to commend itself to every housekeeper.

Mrs. Rorer's 
Cakes J Icings and Fillings 

Every one is interested in the cake problem. There 
is possibly no item in the home bill of fare on which 
a woman prides herself as the ability to make a good 
cake. But how to add variety to the goodness ? Here's 
the book to help. Contains a large number of enticing 
and valuable recipes for cakes of all sorts and condi- 
tions. Some need filling, some need icing — well, here 
you have all the necessary information. Best of all, 
there is no fear as to results. Follow the directions 
and your cake is bound to come out right.

Canning and Preserving 

The only book on the subject worth the name. In 
it Mrs. Rorer discusses at length the canning and pre- 
serving of fruits and vegetables, with the kindred 
subjects of marmalades, butters, fruit jellies and syrups, 
drying and pickling. The recipes are clearly and simply 
given. In the new edition now presented, the author 
has brought the book up to date, and has included 
many new, rare and original recipes that have been 
accumulating since the book was first introduced. It 
has always been a favorite book with the public, and 
now it will be doubly welcome.

her long career as a teacher, writer and lecturer, she 
did not have some that appealed to her more strongly 
than others. She has gathered these together, classi- 
fying them under their different heads. There are Best 
20 Soups; Best 20 Fish Recipes; Best 20 Meats; Best 
20 Salads; Best 20 Desserts; Best 20 Sauces, Vegeta-

Mrs. Rorer*s New Salads 

For Dinners, Luncheons, Suppers and Receptions. 
With a group of Odd Salads and some Ceylon Salads. 

A salad made from a succulent green vegetable and 
French dressing, should be seen on the dinner table 
in every well-regulated household three hundred and 
sixty-five times a year. These green vegetables contain 
the salts necessary to the well being of our blood ; the 
oil is an easily-digested form of fatty matter ; the lemon 
juice gives us sufficient acid; therefore simple salads 
are exceedingly wholesome. 

During the summer, the dinner salad may be com- 
posed of any well-cooked green vegetable, served with 
a French dressing; string beans, cauliflower, a mixture 
of peas, turnips, carrots and new beets, boiled radishes, 
cucumbers, tomatoes, uncooked cabbage, and cooked 
spinach. In the winter serve celery, lettuce, endive and 
chicory.

Mrs. Rorer^s Dainties 

Possibly no part of the daily bill of fare so taxes 
the ingenuity of the housewife as the dessert, that final 
touch to the meal that lingers in the palate like a bene- 
diction. We tire of constant repetitions of familiar 
things. We want variety. Why not have it when 
there are so many ways and means of gratifying our 
tastes. Mrs. Rorer has given here a number of choice 
things covering quite a range of possibilities.

Many Ways for Cooking Eggs 

Did you ever reflect what an important part eggs 
play in our domestic economy ? When from any reason 
other things fail, the perplexed housewife knows she 
can do something to tide over her difficulties by the 
use of eggs. But how many know the great possibilities 
that lie in an Qgg — the very many ways of cooking and 
preparing them for the table? To many, boiled, fried, 
poached and scrambled form the limit of their knowl- 
edge. But get this book and you'll be surprised at the 
feast in store for you. You'll also find recipes for 
delectable Egg Sauces.

Made-Over Dishes 

How to transform the left overs into palatable and 
wholesome dishes. With many new and valuable 
recipes. 
We quote from the author's introduction : 

"Economical marketing does not mean the purchase 
of inferior articles at a cheap price, but of a small 
quantity of the best materials found in the market; 
these materials to be wisely and economically used. 
Small quantity and no waste, just enough and not a 
piece too much, is a good rule to remember. In roasts 
and steaks, however, there will be, in spite of careful 
buying, bits left over, that if economically used, may 
be converted into palatable, sightly and wholesome 
dishes for the next day's lunch or supper.

but where can you not use it to advantage and enjoy- 
ment? In this book Mrs. Rorer has given a lot of new, 
original recipes, with some very odd ones. She has

Mrs, Rorer's Sandwiches 

It is wonderful the amount of pleasure and satis- 
faction that can be had with a Chafing Dish. Few 
people know how to use one successfully, although the 
art is easily acquired. This book, for instance, gives 
the proper directions for making hosts of good things, 
and if they are followed implicitly, the most inexperi- 
enced person can be sure of results. It is a handy 
thing in an emergency, and it forms a delightful adjunct 
to a supper or dinner. Guests are always interested in 
watching the evolution of some delectable dish, and 
the head of the table has a chance to show his or 
her §kill.
