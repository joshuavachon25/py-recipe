'INTRODUCTION 

The duties of the homemaker today demand a greater 
knowledge tlian ever before. It is not enough that she 
oe able to prepare food well, she must be economical in 
purchasing, must know something of the season of fruits 
and vegetables, what is a reasonable price and how to rec- 
ognize (juality. In addition to this she should know how- 
to use left-over foods, how to serve meals well and attrac- 
tively, and also to suit her expenditures to her income. And 
more than this she is expected to know something of the 
nutritive value of foods so that she mav be sure she is 
giving the members of her household the proper amount 
of nourishment in their food. In fact there are a thousand 
and one things the homemaker must know if she is to fill 
her position efficiently. 

This volume contains a collection of the best available 
material on subjects of interest to the homemaker. There 
is a large collection of valuable recipes, most of which are 
adaptable to any income, in addition to this we have in- 
cluded full instructions for serving simple or elaborate 
meals, and an important chapter upon the nutritive value 
of food telling how to plan the meals so that each person 
served is receiving the proper kind and amount of food. 

The chapters on the care and feeding of children will be 
invaluable to the young mother, while those on first aid 
and food for the sick are not only practical but supply the 
essential facts in an easily accessible form. 

It is not necessary to mention the use which can be made 
of the material on the care of the house, cleaning and laun- 
dering for every housewife knows how often she has spent 
much valuable time searching for information to tell her 
how to remove a stain from some fabric or how^ to clean 
some metal. 

We know that this volume contains a vast amount of 
practical, well-arranged material which every housew'ife 
should have at hand and we feel sure that it will meet a 
long- felt need in every household.

ATTENTION ! 

We have tested and tried thor-

them to be all that is claimed

We believe that if any one else

CHAPTER I 

TERMS AND PROCESSES USED IN PREPARING FOOD 

In collecting the recipes for this book no attempt has 
been made to keep them uniform for a particular number 
of servings, but it will be found that most of the recipes 
are for six servings or for four people, with some food 
left for second servings. 

All measurements are level, and the value of careful 
measurement of ingredients in preparing any recipe cannot 
be overestimated. 

In the kitchen more accurate weights and measures are 
coming into common use. 

The basis of the kitchen system of measures is the stand- 
ard cup, a measure holding 3^ pint or 8 fluid ounces, by 
weight half a pound of sugar, butter or chopped meat. 
The cup is marked to show 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 of a cup on one 
side, and 1/3 and 2/3 of a cup on the other side. 

A cup is filled with a spoon and leveled with a knife. To 
measure half a cup, press the article to be measured into 
the cup solidly on a line with the ridge indicating the half- 
cup mark. To measure a cup, pack the food solidly to the 
top and level with a knife. Fractions of a cup are meas- 
ured in the same way as the half -cup. When the recipe 
calls for 1/4 or 1/3 cupful of material, it is often easier to 
measure in tablespoon fuls. Flour is always measured after 
sifting once, and should not be packed in the cup. 

To measure a tablespoon ful or teaspoon ful of material, 
take up a spoonful, then level with a knife. For half a 
spoonful, level with a knife and divide lengthwise of the 
spoon; for a cjuarter spoonful, divide half a spoonful cross- 
wise. A special set of spoon measures, from 1/4 teaspoon- 
ful up, will be found convenient since ordinary spoons vary 
in size and are not adapted to measuring fractions of their 
capacity.

STIRRING, BEATING AND FOLDING 

Stirring is done by moving a spoon around in a circle 
until the ingredients are thoroughly blended. The materials 
may be liquid, dry, or both. A wooden spoon used for 
stirring food while cooking will be found convenient, as 
the handle does not get hot. 

Beating is done by cutting down with a spoon from the 
top to the bottom of a mixture, bringing the spoon up to 
the surface, passing over and down through the mixture 
again and again. This is done to introduce air into the 
mixture and make it light. 

Cutting and Folding is the process by which whites of 
eggs or cream, beaten very light, may be incorporated into 
another mixture without loss of the air bubbles formed. 
Put the two mixtures together; with a spoon cut down to

the bottom of the dish, turn, bring to the top and fold over 
the mixture thus brought to the surface. Repeat until the 
ingredients are blended. 

Sifting. ITour is sifted to make it light and to remove 
any foreign matter which may be present. Dry ingredients 
are sifted together in order to mix them thoroughly. 

PROPORTIONS OF FLOUR AND LEAVENING AGENT 

Two teaspoonfuls of baking powder are used to one 
cupful of flour. If eggs are used, the amount of baking 
powder is lessened. 

One-half teaspoonful of soda is used with one cupful of 
sour milk. ^>om one-half to one teaspoonful of baking 
powder added to a mixture which requires soda and sour 
milk improves the texture of the finished product. 

BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

1 measure liquid to 1 measure flour for pour batters. 

1 measure liquid to about 2 measures flour for drop bat- 
ters. 

1 measure li(|uid to about 3 or more measures flour for 
dough. 

BEATING EGGS 

When eggs are simply added to thicken a mixture, as in 
custards, timbales and Erench omelet, beat only until the 
yolks and whites are well mixed, using a Dover egg-beater. 
When eggs are added for lightness, as in cakes, souftles, 
etc.. beat the whites and yolks separately, the whites until 
very light, using a fork for beating one and the egg-beater 
for beating several : beat the yolks until light-colored and 
thick. 

METHODS OF COOKING 

Boiling is cooking in a quantity of water heated to the 
boiling point (212^ Fahrenheit or 100*^ Centigrade). 

14 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



In boiling meat the cooking is begun in water at the 
boihng point to insure the retention of the juices and 
extractives and is completed just below the boiling point. 
In stewing the cooking is done in water in such a manner 
that part of the juices are drawn out and part are re- 
tained. 

Simmering is cooking in water below the boiling point. 
Broiling is cooking on a wire rack over coals or under 
the flame in a gas range oven or broiler. 

Panbroiling. — Cooking of chops or steak in a hot frying 
pan, the pan being the medium of communicating all the 
heat received by the article (no fat in the pan). 

Steaming is cooking food over boiling water. The food 
may come in contact with the steam or the mold in which 
the food is placed ( for example brown bread ) comes in 
contact with the steam. 

Cooking over Hot Water. — The vessel in which the 
cooking is done does not come in direct contact with the 
heat of the stove, boiling water intervening. The double 
boiler is the proper utensil. 

Frying is a form of cookery in which the article is im- 
mersed in fat at a high temperature. 350° to 400° Fahren- 
heit. 

To Saute is to cook in a heated frying pan with just 
fat enough to keep the article from adhering to the pan. 
When drops of liciuid appear on the upper surface of the 
article, turn to cook the other side. 

A large supply of fat is needed for " frying " properly, 
but more fat is probably absorbed when an article is sauted 
than when the same article is cooked in deep fat. 

To test fat for frying : cut a cube from the crumb of 
stale bread and drop it into the fat. If the bread is golden 
brown in 60 seconds the fat is right for frying uncooked 
mixtures like doughnuts and fritters. If the bread browns 
in 40 seconds the fat is right for frying articles made of 
cooked food as crociuettes and fish cakes.

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Baking. — ^Cooking in an oven of a temperature from 
330° Fahrenheit to 450'^ Fahrenheit or higher. For best 
results, in baking meats, poultry, etc., baste with fat and 
cook at a temperature low enough to keep the fat from 
burning. This is often called roasting. 

To test the oven for baking place a piece of white un- 
glazed paper on the rack where the food is to be baked. H 
the paper turns golden brown in five minutes the oven is 
moderately hot. H the paper turns dark brown in five 
minutes the oven is hot. 

INGREDIENTS FOR COOKING 

Bread flour is used in all recipes which require yeast. 
Pastry flour is used with baking powder, soda and cream 
of tartar, soda and sour milk or soda and molasses. 

Oftentimes only one flour, such as Gold Medal Flour, is 
purchased. This is a bread flour and when substituted for 
pastry flour one-eighth less should be used. For example : 
if the recipe calls for 2 cupfuls pastry flour and you wish 
to substitute bread flour use F>4 cupfuls. 

At present butter is too expensive to be used for any- 
thing but table purposes. We suggest that in all recipes 
for cream sauce or white sauce, oleomargarine or nut- 
margarine be substituted for butter. It may also be used 
with vegetables and meats. In making 1)iscuits, muffins, 
cakes, etc., we suggest using lard, compound, Crisco, 
Mazola. Wesson Oil, Cottolene or oleomargarine. 

In substituting lard, compound, Crisco or the various 
oils for butter in a recipe which calls for butter, use one- 
eighth less, as these materials contain less water than 
butter and therefore contain more fat. Oleomargarine and 
nutmargarine should be used in the same proportions as 
butter.

EXTRACT FROM "MEASUREMENTS FOR THE 
HOUSEHOLD" 

Issued by The Couwiomvealth of Massachusetts Depart- 
ment of Weights and Measures 

PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN MAKING PURCHASES 

li yovi are engaged in the industry of housekeeping you 
should : 

Trade with dealers who have accurate and sealed weigh- 
ing and measuring devices. 

Check up all goods received to ascertain if full quantity 
has been delivered. 

Purchase package goods which are legibly marked on the 
outside of package with the net quantity which it contains. 

See that your milk and cream bottles are filled to the 
cap or stopple. 

The coal dealer is required by law to deliver to you a 
sworn statement as to the weight delivered. See that you 
receive such a certificate. 

n any coal dealer neglects to give you a certificate 
stating the number of pounds contained in a load that is 
being delivered to you, the local sealer of weights and 
measures should be promptly notified. 

In purchasing ice be careful to ask for a certain weight 
of ice, viz., 50 pounds, 75 pounds, 100 pounds, and do not 
be content to accept 10-cent, 20-cent, 30-cent pieces. 

In purchasing meats request that all " trimmings " be 
included with purchase; otherwise a correct check of goods 
cannot be made. 

In purchasing turkey, chicken, etc., do not accept the 
weight as sometimes already marked on the same, but 
insist that the commodity be re-weighed in your presence. 

Equip your kitchen with a good scale of 10 to 20 pounds 
capacity, weighing in ounces, and have it tested and 
sealed annuallv by the local sealer of weights and measures. 

18 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Use this scale for checking all weights of commodities de- 
livered, and if underweight is found to exist, do not fail 
to bring each case to the attention of the dealer. The 
shortage may be due merely to carelessness, but you are 
entitled to full weight, and he should know that you are 
a business woman and will not countenance unbusiness- 
like methods in his dealings with you. 

Also have on hand an accurate dry quart, a liciuid quart, 
a 60-inch steel tape, an 8-ounce graduate. These should 
also be submitted to the sealer for test. 

Be businesslike when purchasing. The merchant is care- 
ful that in his sales he receives full value for correct weight 
or measure given. He is obliged to be thus careful, else 
his business would be done at a loss. W hy then should 
the business of housekeeping be done in a careless manner 
and at a loss. Order commodities in terms of weight and 
measure. Do not order a "pail of lard," "print of butter," 
"30 cents worth of potatoes," "piece of bacon," "can of 
oil," " box or basket of fruit," unless you know how much 
that pail, print, package, etc., contains in weight and 
measure. 

Refuse to accept a bill from your tradesman made in the 
following manner : — 

Beef $0.40 

Butter 35 

Oil 15 

Lard 10 

Insist that a bill be rendered in the following manner : — 

Beef, 1 pound 6 ounces $0.40 

Butter, 1 pound 35 

Oil, 1 gallon 15 

Lard, 1 pound 10

BEVERAGES 

Hot Beverages. Ereshly boiled water should be used in 
making hot beverages. 



FRENCH COFFEE (Percolated) 

1 cupful hnely ground coffee. 

6 cupfuls boiling water. 

There are a number of pots on the market for making 
French coffee ; they are suitable, provided they contain a 
fine strainer, which holds the coffee and prevents the 
grounds from getting into the infusion. To make coffee 
in this fashion, put the coffee into the strainer, which is 
generally set into the mouth of the pot ; place the pot on 
the stove and slowly pour the water over the grounds, 
allowing it to filter through. If you wish to have the coffee 
stronger, pour out the infusion and pour it a second time 
over the grounds, but do not allow it to cool. 

BOILED COFFEE 

4 tablespoonfuls ground coffee, 

4 cupfuls freshly boiling water, 

Yi white of t^gg. 

Mix the white of ^gg with 3 tablesponfuls cold water, 
beating with a fork; add the coffee and stir. Scald coffee- 
pot, put in prepared coffee, pour in boiling water, cover the 
spout, and boil five minutes. Pour in quickly ^4 cupful 
cold water; let stand three minutes to settle. Strain into 
a hot pot. Wash eggs before breaking and save the shells 
for clearing coffee. The shells may be substituted for the 
^gg white, enough of the white usually clings to the shell 
to make it eft'ective for this purpose.

TEA 

A\'ater for tea should be used when it has just reached 
the boihng point. Teas are of different strengths, but a 
safe rule is 1 teaspoonful dry tea to 1 cupful boiling water. 
Scald the pot, put in dry tea, and cover one minute. Add 
boiling water and cover closely. Let stand three to six 
minutes and strain off into another hot pot. 

RUSSIAN TEA 

Follow the recipe for making tea, Russian tea is always 
served without milk. Allow a thin slice of lemon or orange, 
from which the seeds have been removed for each cup. 
Sugar may be added according to taste. 

ICED TEA 

3 tablespoonfuls tea. 

4 cupfuls boiling water. 

Follow the recipe for making tea. Strain into glasses 
one-third full of cracked ice. The flavor is improved by 
chilling the infusion quickly. Serve the tea with slices of 
lemon and sugar to taste. 



BREAKFAST COCOA 

2 tablespoonfuls cocoa, 

2 tablespoonfuls sugar, 

2 cupfuls boiling water, 

2 cupfuls of n^ilk. 

Few grains salt. 

Scald milk. Mix cocoa, sugar and salt, add the boiling 
water slowly and boil 3 minutes. Turn the cocoa into the 
scalded milk and beat one minute with the Dover egg- 
beater. This prevents scum forming.

Scald milk. Mix cocoa, sugar and salt, add the boiling 
water slowly and boil 2 minutes. Pour into the scalded 
milk and beat one minute, using Dover egg-beater. 

COCOA NIBS OR "SHELLS" 

Wet 2 ounces cocoa shells with a little cold water and 
stir into them a quart of boiling water. Boil steadily for 
an hour and a half; strain, stir in a quart of fresh milk, 
bring to the scalding point, and serve. Sweeten in the 
cups. 

AFTERNOON CHOCOLATE 

1 quart milk, 

2 squares chocolate, 

3 tablespoonfuls boiling water, 
2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 

Put the chocolate in a double boiler. When it melts, add 
the sugar and stir thoroughly till dissolved. Add the boil- 
ing water and beat it smooth, then pour over it the scalded 
milk. With an egg-beater, whip the beverage till it foams, 
keeping it over the fire. Serve from a chocolate pot, 
sweetening to taste and putting into each cupful a table- 
spoonful of whipped cream. 

FRUIT BEVERAGES 

The majority of fruit punches, as a rule, have one foun- 
dation — a syrup of equal measure of water and sugar. 
This is a much better way to prepare such drinks than by 
melting sugar, which can only be half dissolved in cold 
water. After the syrup for such a beverage is prepared, 
its flavoring is limited only by the variety of fruit on 
hand.

CHAPTER HI 

BREAD AND BREAD-MAKING* 

Probably no food, unless it is milk, is more generally 
used than bread, nor is there any food that constitutes a 
larger part of the diet of the average person. The reason 
for this importance of bread is very simple. Ever since 
the far-off days when the wild cereals were first found or 
cultivated men have known that food prepared from them 
would support life and strength better than any other single 
food except milk. Although in this country the ease with 
which other foods can be obtained makes bread seem less 
important, there are many districts of Europe and Asia 
where it is still the " staff of life," and where if people pray 
for their daily bread they mean it literally. 

In regard to its ingredients, bread is one of the simplest 
of cooked foods, but in regard to the changes which the 
raw materials must undergo to produce a finished loaf it is 
one of the most complicated. Flour, water, a pinch of 
salt, and a little yeast are the necessary ingredients. 

In the flour mill, where the initial steps in bread making 
may be said to be taken, the grain is ground into powder, 
the coarser outer parts being sifted out as bran, while the 
finer interior parts constitute flour. Once in the baker's 
hands, the flour is mixed with water and yeast, or some- 
thing which will produce the same effect. When this paste, 
or dough, containing yeast is set in a warm place the yeast 
begins to "work," and the dough to "rise" ; in other words, 
the yeast causes a change known as " alcoholic fermenta- 
tion " to set in, one of the principal results of which is the 
production of carbon-dioxid gas. If the dough has been 
w-ell mixed, this gas appears all through it, and expanding, 
leavens or raises it throughout. After the yeast has worked 
sufficiently the dough is shut up in a hot oven. Here the 

*Extract from Farmers' Bulletin 389, "Bread and Bread Making." 

38 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



heat kills the yeast and prevents further alcoholic ferment- 
ation, causes the gas to expand and stretch open the little 
pockets which it has formed in the dough, changes some of 
the water present into steam, and expands any air mechan- 
ically included, thus raising the loaf still more. Further, 
the heat hardens and darkens the outer layers into what 
is called the " crust." The sum of these changes in the 
oven is called " haking." When this has been continued 
long enough the bread is " done " and is ready to be cooled 
and eaten. 

The nutritive value of bread depends not only on its 
chemical composition, but also on its digestibility, and 
digestibility in its turn seems to depend largely on the light- 
ness of the loaf. It is the gluten in a dough which gives it 
the pow'er of stretching and rising as the gas from the yeast 
expands within it, and hence of making a light loaf. Rye 
has less gluten proteids than wheat, while barley, oats, and 
maize have none, so that they do not make a light, porous 
loaf like wheat. It is possible that of the various kinds of 
wheat flour those containing a large part of the bran-entire- 
wheat and graham flours — furnish the body with more 
mineral matter than fine white flour ; but it is not certain 
that the extra amount of mineral matter furnished is of 
the same value as that from the interior portion of the 
grain. It seems safe to say that, as far as is knowai, for a 
given amount of money, white flour yields the most actual 
nourishment with the various food ingredients in good 
proportion. 

It should be remembered, however, that all kinds of bread 
are wholesome if of good cjualitv, and the use of several 
kinds is an easy means of securing variety in the diet. 

The lightness and sweetness of bread depend as much 
on the way in which it is made as on the materials used. 
The greatest care should be used in preparing and baking 
the dough and in cooking and keeping the finished bread. 
Though good housekeepers agree that light, well-raised 

39 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



bread can readily be made with reasonable care and atten- 
tion, heavy, badly raised bread is unfortunately very com- 
mon. Such bread is not palatable, and is generally con- 
sidered to be unwholesome, and probably more indigestion 
has been caused by it than by all other badly cooked 
foods. 



MIXING THE BREAD 

The first step in bread making, as in cookery, is to get 
together everything necessary in utensils and materials. The 
utensils needed are a bread pan with a close-fitting, ven- 
tilated cover, a measuring cup, a spoon for beating the 
batter, and a molding cloth. The molding cloth is a square 
of heavy duck or sail cloth; it is much superior to the 
smooth surface of a wooden molding board, because con- 
siderable flour can be sifted into the rough surface of the 
fabric. It holds the flour and there is no sticking of soft 
dough. As the flour works into the dough, sift in more, 
rubbing it into the cloth with the hand. When finished, 
shake and fold the cloth, and lay it away until needed again. 
It can be used a number of times before being washed; 
when it has to go to the laundry, soak it for an hour in 
cold water, and rinse several times, before putting in the 
suds ; hot water would turn the flour into dough ; then it 
would be no easy task to get it clean. 

Sift into a pan four or five quarts of flour, and set it 
either over the register or in a moderate oven to warm, 
unless working in midsummer. Cold flour will always 
retard the raising of bread. Scald one pint of milk and 
pour it into the bread pan over two teaspoons of salt. Add 
a pint of cold water, then one yeast cake dissolved in half 
a cupful of lukewarm water. To this liquid add seven or 
eight cupfuls of warm flour, and beat the batter thoroughly 
with a wire spoon. Do not stop beating until the batter is 
a mass of bubbles. Then add more flour till you have a 
soft dough. When it becomes too stiff to stir, dust plenty 
of flour into the molding cloth, rubbing it into the fabric 

40 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



till it will hold no more. Gather the dough into a ball and 
drop it on the cloth. Now begin to knead, folding the edge 
of the dough farthest from you tow^ard the center, pressing 
it away with the palms, gently yet quickly. The process of 
kneading has more to do with good bread than almost any- 
thing else. As you work the dough becomes full of little 
bubbles and blisters. When the dough is smooth, elastic 
does not stick, and is so spongy that it rises quickly after 
denting it with your finger, it is ready to set to rise. Place 
dough in pan, cover and set the pan in a w^arm place. 

As soon as the dough has doubled in bulk, turn it out 
on a slightly floured molding cloth and knead into loaves. 
This second kneading is a slight one. only enough to pre- 
pare it for the pans and get rid of any large air bubbles 
which, if left in, would mean holes in the bread. Have the 
pans greased. Always make small loaves ; generally the 
right size can be guessed at by having each pan half full of 
dough. Bread baked in the French or round bread pans is 
good. When large brick-shaped loaves are made, it is 
almost impossible to bake them to the heart unless the crust 
gets very thick and hard, li heat does not penetrate to the 
center of a loaf, yeast mav remain alive, causing bread to 
sour. 

After the bread is in the pans set it to rise in a warm 
place and let rise until it becomes double in bulk. 

BAKING BREAD 

When bread is nearly ready for the oven, test the oven, 
which should be hot enough to turn a piece of wdiite paper 
dark brown in 6 minutes. Place pans in lower part of 
oven and as near center as possible. 

Time. — Small loaves require about 35 minutes, large 
loaves ( 4 in. thick ) 50 or 60 minutes. 

Divide time into quarters as follows : — 

1st. Quarter, bread should rise and begin to browm. 

2nd. Quarter, now reduce the heat in the oven and bread 
continues to rise and brown. 

41 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



3rtl Uuarter, it finishes browning and rising. 

4th Quarter. l)aking is finished and the loaf draws away 
from sides of pan. 

Turn the loaves so that they will brown evenly. 

Test zvJicn done. Bread draws away from sides of pans 
when done and sounds hollow when tapped with finger. 

Take out the well-browned loaves, turn them immediately 
out of the pans and set them to cool on a wire stand. If 
loaves are set fiat, the bottom will become moist; if they 
are wrapped in a cloth there is a soft, steamy crust. In 
summer if the steam is not allowed to evaporate from 
bread, there is danger of it molding, so it must never be 
put away until perfectly cool. Store it in a small closet 
with a door that closes tight. 

NOTES ON BREAD-MAKING 

Some cooks prefer to set a sponge when making bread, 
allowing it to rise in the shape of a well-beaten batter before 
adding fiour enough to do the kneading. " Sponging " 
makes a fine-grained bread, but it lengthens the time re- 
cjuired for making, as two risings are needed after the 
sponge is light. 

Bread may be made from water alone instead of " half 
and half ", as milk and water bread is called. Water bread 
is tougher and sweeter and keeps lietter than that made 
from all milk. 

If bread must be made in a hurry simply double the 
amount of yeast, if you are using compressed yeast. 

Should the oven be too hot. set a pan of cold water in 
it for a few minutes. 

The best way to care for a bread box is to wash it in 
hot water, then dry it on the liack of the range. This 
ought to be done between each baking to keep it fresh and 
sweet. 

If you are detained from getting bread into the pan? 
when it has risen sufiiciently, take a knife and cut down 

42 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



the dough till you are ready to attend to it. This allows 
the gas to escape and there is no danger of souring if you 
i cannot return to it for half an hour. 

It is best to have the fire in such condition that it will 
Jneed no replenishing while bread baking is in progress. 

Yeast may be kept perfectly fresh for at least a week or 
[ten days by immersing the cake in cold water. The particles 
lof yeast settle at the bottom and w'ater acts as a seal from 
Fthe air. Cover the glass in which yeast is dissolved and 
[keep it in the refrigerator. 

H you have no covered bread pan set the dough to rise 
[in a large bowl or basin and keep it well covered with a 
ttowel. 

To hurry bread slightly add one tablespoon ful of sugar 

to four quarts of flour. The yeast plant begins to grow 

lore cjuickly when there is sugar to feed on. When there 

[is no sugar, the yeast has to change some of the starch to 

I sugar. 

Pricking the top of a loaf with a fork before it is put 
I in the oven tends to make it rise and bake evenly. 
Never use flour without sifting it first. 



fWATER BREAD 

4 cupfuls boiling water. 

2 tablespoon fuls lard. 
1 tablespoon ful sugar. 
1^ teaspoonfuls salt.

1 water; when lukewarm, add dissolved yeast cake and 5 

[cupfuls flour; then stir until thoroughly mixed. Add re- 
laining flour, mix and knead. Return to bowl ; let rise

1 tablespoonful butter. 
1^ teaspoonfuls salt. 

1 yeast cake dissolved in ^4 cupful lukewarm water. 
6 cupfuls sifted flour, or 1 cupful white flour and enough 
entire wheat flour to knead. 

Prepare and bake as Water Bread. When entire wheat 
flour is used add three tablespoonfuls molasses. Bread may 
be mixed, raised, and baked in five hours by using one yeast 
cake. Bread made in this way has proved most satisfac- 
tory. It is usually mixed in the morning, and the cook is 
able to watch the dough while rising and keep it at uniform 
temperature. It is often desirable to place bowl containing 
dough in pan of water, keeping water at uniform tempera- 
ture of from 95° to 100° F. Cooks who have not proved 
themselves satisfactory bread makers are successful wdien 
employing this method. (Fannie M. Farmer.)

flour into it until it can be kneaded on an unfloured board 
for 1 minute without sticking. Place the dough in a clean 
bowl. Cover it tightly ( to prevent the formation of a 
crust) and let it rise until it doubles its bulk. Knead the 
dough on an unfloured board just enough to distribute the 
gas bubbles evenly. Shape into a loaf and place in an oiled 
tin, pressing it into the corners. Let the loaf rise until 
double its bulk and bake for 50 or 60 minutes. Remove 
the loaf from the tin and cool on a wire rack.

Mix and sift dry ingredients, add molasses and milk, stir 
until well mixed, turn into a well-buttered mould and steam 
three and one-half hours. The cover should be buttered 
before being placed on mould, and then tied down with 
string; otherwise the bread in rising might force off cover. 
Mould should never be filled more than two-thirds full. 
A melon-mould or one-pound baking-powder boxes make 
the most attractive-shaped loaves, but a five-pound lard pail 
answers the purpose. For steaming, place mould on a trivet 
in kettle containing boiling water, allowing w'ater to come 
half-way up around mould; cover closely and steam, add- 
ing, as needed, more boiling water. (Fannie M. Farmer.)

STALE BREAD 

A careful housewife plans to keep in stock the smallest 
amount possible of stale bread, and of that stock not a 
morsel is consigned to the garbage can. There is economy 
in adopting the English fashion of bread cutting, placing 
the loaf on a wooden trencher with a keen knife, and cut- 
ting at the table each slice as it is required. 

Keep a pan in the pantry to receive all scraps left on 
plates, toast crusts, or morsels from the bread jar. Nev^er 
put them in a covered pail or jar ; they will mold. Save all 
soft inside parts of a loaf to be used as soon as possible 
for croutons, slices or cubes for toast and toast points, and 
soft scraps for meat and fish dressings, puddings, omelets, 
scalloped dishes, griddle cakes, souffles, croquettes, and the 
numerous dishes for which stale bread may be utilized. 

Never allow the crusts to grow more than a golden 
brown. When the scraps of bread are thoroughly dry, roll 
them on a board or put through the meat chopper, using 
the finest knife. 

TOAST 

Toast bread over a clear, red fire for two minutes. Then 
turn it over and let all the moisture be drawn out of the 
bread. Butter and serve immediately. Toast may be uti- 
lized, especially for breakfast, in all sorts of ways. Plain 
toast is a favorite in most households ; then there are milk 
toast, cream toast, dropped eggs on toast, water toast, and 
the excellent dish of bread soaked in egg and milk and 
sauted, which has all sorts of names, French, Spanish, and 
Scotch toast, but more properly egged toast. At the lun- 
cheon and dinner table toast appears in all forms — under 
chicken and with such vegetables as asparagus and spinach ; 
under minced meats, fricassees, and creamed mixtures, or 
in the delicate canape.

waffle irons, turning the cakes just as soon as possible after 
the batter is put in all the compartments of the iron. 

BAKING POWDERS 

Baking Powders have for their essential constituents 
sodium bicarbonate and some form of acid or acid salt. 
During the bread-making process in which they are em- 
ployed, under the influence of the licpiid used in mixing 
the dough, chemical reaction more or less complete ensues 
between these constituents. This results in the evolution 
of the leavening carbon dioxide gas, which eventually 
passes off and a fixed residue which remains. It is, there- 
fore, the character of this residue which determines the 
hygienic quality of any baking powder. 

72 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Based upon these residues, Baking Powders may be con- 
venieiitly divided into three groups : 

1. Baking powders made of cream of tartar, baking soda 
and a httle starch. The resulting salt is the Rochelle Salt 
known in medicine. These powders are highest in price. 

2. Powders made of acid phosphate and baking soda, the 
resulting salt being harmless. These include the medium- 
priced baking powders. 

3. Cheap baking powders, which usually contain some 
alum. These should be avoided, as thev are not safe to use.

CHAPTER V 

CEREALS* 

Cereals are grains, and include wheat, oats, rice, rye, 
barley, corn, etc., and among them are many valuable foods. 
In what we call breakfast cereals we have a number of 
foods that are unusually rich in nitrogenous matter and 
mineral sulistances ; therefore making an excellent morning 
meal with no further addition than milk or cream, for all 
cereals are lacking in fat. 

Unless cereals can be subjected to the long, slow cooking 
which is necessary, they had better not be eaten, for nothing 
is so indigestible as half-raw cereal. ]Most of the cereals 
put up in packages, so the directions say, can be cooked 
in half an hour, but that is not possible. Few of them, 
except the fine-grained wheat foods, are fit to eat till they 
have had at least one hour's cooking in a double boiler. If 
they can have longer they are so much the better. Always 
add salt to a cereal — one teaspoon ful to a cjuart of water — 
and let it dissolve before the grains are put in, so it will 
flavor the whole mass. 

The best way to cook any rough-grained cereal is to drop 
it slowly into water which is boiling briskly in the upper 
part of a double boiler. After cooking for a few minutes 
on the stove, set it over the water and allow the grains to 
swell slowly so the food is stiff enough to be chewed. 

Cornmeal demands a long time for cooking — at least six 
hours — and it swells, so it should have six times the same 
measurement of water. Granular cereals — farina, for in- 
stance — should be mixed with a little cold water and stirred 
smooth before being added to the necessary amount of 
boiling water; this prevents it from becoming lumpy. 

Buy cereals in small c[uantities and store in glass jars 
with tight-fitting lids instead of the pasteboard boxes in 

*Extract from Farmers' Bulletin 249, "Cereal Breakfast Foods."

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



which they are sold. This keeps them fresher and safe 
from the invasion of moths or mice. 

There is such a bewildering variety of cereal breakfast 
foods on the market, with such differences in appearance, 
taste, and claims to nutritive value, that it is hard to make 
an intelligent choice among them. True economy here, as 
with other kinds of food, depends upon the amount of 
digestible nutrients which can be obtained for a given sum 
of money. 

Of the five cereals most commonly used for breakfast 
foods, oats contain perhaps the largest quantities of the 
important nutrients, with a fairly low proportion of crude 
fiber. Wheat ranks very close to oats in all respects, how- 
ever, and even when prepared with the bran is freer from 
crude fiber. Many persons consider that the bran contains 
so much protein and desirable mineral matters that it should 
be retained in spite of the crude fiber which it contains. 
Digestion experiments indicate, however, that the crude 
fiber makes the whole material so much less digestible that 
more protein is actually available to the body when the bran 
is excluded. Moreover, the ordinary mixed diet probably 
furnishes all the mineral matters which the healthy body 
needs, so bran is not needed for this purpose. The bran- 
containing preparations should be avoided by persons of 
weak digestion, but are often useful in cases of constipation. 
Such differences are, however, too small to be of importance 
to normal, healthy persons, and all the ordinary varieties of 
breakfast cereals are wholesome. Individual taste must de- 
termine which are most palatable. Appearance, palatability 
and relative cost will always and rightly be important feat- 
ures in the selection of all these cereal breakfast foods. 
Corn and its preparations are rich in carbohydrates and fat, 
but are slightly less digestible than the other cereals. Rice 
is poor in protein, but remarkably free from crude fiber, and 
consequently furnishes a large proportion of digestible car- 
bohydrates. Barley contains a fair proportion of nutrients 

76 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



and is moderately digestible. All these differences in com- 
position and digestibility are comlparatively slight and may 
be disregarded by healthy persons living on the ordinary 
mixed diet. 

Thoroughness of cooking is a factor which has a bearing 
upon digestibility. It not only makes the cereals more 
palatable, but also breaks down the walls of indigestible 
cellulose which surround the starch grains and other nutri- 
ents and produces other changes so that the digestive juices 
can work on the nutritive ingredients more effectively. 
Poorly cooked cereals are less palatable than the same dishes 
well cooked, and may cause indigestion and be really harm- 
ful. When the partially cooked preparations are used care 
should be taken to insure sufficient re-cooking before serv- 
ing. The majority of the ready-to-eat brands are apparent- 
ly thoroughly cooked. 

In choosing among the various breakfast foods it must 
be remembered that a novel appearance and quasi-scientific 
name do not necessarily represent any usual food value. 
Unless something is added during the process of manufac- 
ture, all brands must have just about the same composition 
as the cereals from which they are made, as manipulation 
cannot increase the amount of food material in a cereal 
product, though it may materially modify its appearance 
and flavor. 

It should not be forgotten that breakfast cereals of all 
sorts are usually free from harmful adulterants and that, 
especially in the case of package goods, they reach the con- 
sumer in a clean, fresh condition. The retail prices of 
breakfast cereals run all the way from 5 cents a pound for 
some of the plain meals sold in bulk to 15 cents or more 
for some of the ready-to-eat brands. The proportion of 
nutrients supplied, pound for pound, does not differ greatly. 
The partially cooked brands, usually medium priced, are 
certainly easier to prepare than the raw grains, and may be 
more truly economical in households where time, labor, and 
fuel are scarce. In general, the ready-to-eat brands are 

77 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



higher in price than the partially cooked goods, though they 
have practically the same nutritive value, pound for pound, 
as other classes of cereal breakfast foods. The extent to 
which they should be used for their special flavor and the 
variety they give to the diet must be decided according to 
individual circumstances. It is only fair to add, however, 
that, whatever the relative food values of malted and un- 
malted foods, the cost of the former to the manufacturer is 
greater, and the increased price is to this extent justified. 

All things considered, the cereal breakfast foods as a 
class are nutritious, convenient, and reasonably economical 
foods and worthy of an important place in the diet when 
judiciously combined with other foods.

flowers. The cereals are the most valual)le of the vegetable 
foods, including as they do the grains from which are made 
nearly all the bread of the world. The use of cereals for 
bread making, for breakfast foods, and in similar ways is 
taken up elsewhere. 

Legvmies belong to the pulse family. The fruit is usually 
in the shape of a pod. Beans, peas, cowpeas, and lentils 
are the legumes principally employed as human food. The 
dried seeds of beans, peas, and lentils constitute a most 
valuable all-the-year-round food supply. The seeds occupy 
small space, keep well, and may be prepared in a great 
manv appetizing and nutritious forms. 

The ripe leguminous seeds are very rich in nitrogenous 
matter. When properly cooked and consumed in reason- 
able (juantities peas, beans, and lentils may replace a por- 
tion of the meat in the daily dietary. 

Among the foods served as table vegetables, tubers and 
roots have an important place. The potato comes next to 
the cereals in its almost universal employment. We have 
no other vegetable that lends itself to such a variety of 
preparations. The potato contains a large percentage of 
water, a fair percentage of starch, a very small percentage

for the Table."

of sugar, and nitrogenous, fatty, and gummy matter, and 
about 1 per cent, of mdneral matter. The mineral matter 
consists of potash and soda salts, citrates, phosphates, 
magnesia, and silicate of lime. It is to this mineral matter 
that the potato owes its antiscorbutic properties. 

The true roots most used as table vegetables are beets, 
radishes, turnips, parsnips, carrots, salsify, and celeriac. 
Both the parsnip and salsify withstand frost and may be 
left in the ground all winter, thus making it possible to 
have these vegetables in the early spring as well as in the 
fall. 

The bulb-bearing plants belong to the lily family, the 
onion being the bulb most generally used as a vegetable 
and flavorer. 

The herbaceous vegetables cabbage, lettuce, celery, spin- 
ach, etc., are valuable for their refreshing c|ualities, the salts 
they }ield, and the variety they give to our diet ; but owing 
to the amount of water they contain (90 per cent, or more 
on an average) their food value is low. The leaves, stems, 
and shoots are the parts used as food. These vegetables 
should be employed while young and tender ; the more 
rapidly the vegetables grow the more tender they will be. 
The list of herbaceous vegetables is long and includes the 
cabbage tribe, celery, asparagus, and all the green leaves, 
stalks, and shoots that are employed, cooked, or used as 
salads. 

Fruits used as vegetables include tomatoes, okra, squash, 
pumpkin, cucumber, eggplant, and peppers, among others. 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING VEGETABLE 
COOKING 

Vegetables are baked, roasted, fried, or boiled, they are 
used for making a great variety of dishes, and are prepared 
for the table in other ways ; but the most common method 
of cooking them is in boiling water. Steaming is not in- 
frequently resorted to as a method of cooking vegetables 
and is, of course, similar in principle to boiling in water. 

93 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



The simpler the methods of cooking and serving vegeta- 
bles the better. A properly grown and well-cooked vegetable 
will be palatable and readily digestible. 

All green vegetables, roots, and tubers should be crisp 
and firm when put on to cook. H for any reason a vegeta- 
ble has lost its firmness and crispness, it should be soaked 
in very cold water until it becomes crisp. With new veg- 
etables this will be only a matter of minutes, while old 
roots and tubers often rec{uire many hours. All vegetables 
should be thoroughly cleaned just before being put on to 
cook. Vegetables that form in heads, such as cabbage, cauli- 
flower, and Brussels sprouts, should be soaked, heads 
turned down, in salted cold water, to which a few spoon- 
fuls of vinegar may be added. If there are any worms or 
other forms of animal life in these vegetables, they will 
crawl out. To secure the best results all vegetables except 
the dried legumes should be put in boiling water, and the 
water made to boil again as soon as possible after the 
vegetables have been added, and should be kept boiling until 
the cooking is finished. Herbaceous vegetables should boil 
rapidly all the time. With tubers, roots, cauliflower, etc., 
the boiling should not be so violent as to break the vegeta- 
bles. 

To secure the most appetizing and palatable dishes, only 
fresh tender vegetables should be cooked. If, however, 
green beans, peas, etc., have grown a little too old and it 
still seems best to gather them, a very small amount of 
baking soda added to the water in which they are boiled 
makes them more tender, it is commonly believed, and 
helps to retain the color. Too much soda injures the flavor, 
an excess must be carefuly avoided. 

In preparing vegetables for the table the careful cook 
will remove all edible portions and will see to it that the 
total amount of refuse is as small as is consistent with 
good quality. Thin paring of potatoes and other vegetables 
is an economy which is worth while to practice, and is an 
easy way of decreasing useless loss.

CREAMED AND SCALLOPED VEGETABLES 

Vegetables may be creamed by cutting them into cubes 
when cooked, adding White Sauce, and then reheating. H 
the cut vegetables are cold, they can be heated by adding 
them to the sauce with the last portion of liquid. By the 
time the sauce reaches the boiling point, the vegetables will 
be heated. Care should be taken not to break the vegeta- 
bles while heating them in the sauce. Care should also be 
taken to prevent the sauce from scorching. An asbestos 
mat over a gas burner is desirable for this purpose. Use 
one part of white sauce with 2 or 3 parts of diced vegeta- 
bles. 

\'egetal)les may be scalloped by placing Creamed Vegeta- 
bles in an oiled baking dish, covering with buttered crumbs, 
and I^rowning in the oven. A scalloped vegetable should 
be served from the dish in which it is baked. 

CREAM SAUCE FOR VEGETABLES 

Blend 2 tablespoonfuls butter with 2 tablespoon fuls flour; 
then add gradually 1 pint hot milk, and beat till creamy. 
Add Yj teaspoon ful salt, a speck of pepper. Let the sauce 
boil up once. 

CRUMBS FOR SCALLOPED DISHES 

1 cupful soft bread crumbs. 
y^ teaspoon ful salt. 
White pepper. 

1 tablespoonful butter or butter substitute. 

Mix seasonings and crumbs together, then add to the 
melted l)utter, or place the butter in bits over the seasoned 
crumbs. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 

2 tablespoonfuls Crisco. 

1 pound artichokes. 

2 tablespoonfuls flour. 

1 yolk of ^gg. 

2 teaspoonfuls lemon juice. 
\y2 cupfuls of milk. 

98 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 




You will find the above article to be all 
that is claimed for it by the manufacturer.

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



2 tablespoonfuls cream. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

1 teaspoonful chopped parsley. 

)4 cupful vinegar. 

1 pint boiling milk. 

Wash and scrape artichokes, and place in cold water 
containing vinegar ; when all are done, rinse in water and 
put into boiling milk, add one cupful boiling water and one 
teaspoonful of salt. Boil quickly with lid off. When tender 
lift into hot dish and cover with sauce. For sauce : blend 
Crisco and flour in saucepan over fire, add mjilk, salt and 
pepper and cook five minutes. Remove from fire, add egg 
beaten with cream and lemon juice, pour over artichokes 
and sprinkle parsley over top. 

HARVARD BEETS 

Wash 12 small beets, cook in boiling water until soft, dip 
in cold water to remove skins, and cut beets in thin slices, 
or small cubes. Mix one-half cupful sugar and one-half 
tablespoonful corn-starch. Add one-half cupful vinegar 
and let boil five minutes. Pour over beets, and let stand 
on back of range one-half hour. Just before serving add 
two tablespoonfuls butter. 

BAKED BEANS 

Soak dried beans over night, cook the beans gently until 
the skins begin to break, then drain off the water. Put a 
layer of beans in a bean pot or deep earthen dish, and on 
this layer, in the center of the dish, place a piece of salt 
pork {" streak of fat and streak of lean ") having the rind 
side up, using for 1 cjuart of beans a half-pound of pork; 
the rind should be scored. Fill up the dish with the beans, 
and add seasonings and water to cover the beans. The 
simplest seasoning is one tablespoonful of salt and half a 
teaspoonful of pepper to a cjuart of beans. Mix the sah 
and pepper with the water. If liked, a tablespoonful o1 

100 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



mustard may be added as well as a tablespoon f til or more 
of molasses and an onion. Instead of the pork a piece of 
salt or fat beef or mutton may be employed. In this case 
there should be from \y2 to 2 pounds of the meat per quart 
of beans. If fresh meat is used, add more salt to the beans. 
If, on the other hand, salt meat is used, probably 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt will be enough for each quari of beans. 

When mutton is employed trim off every particle of the 
skin. 

Bake the beans in a very moderate oven for eight or ten 
hours. Add a little boiling water from time to time, but 
never enough to bring the water beyond the top of the 
beans. Any kind of beans may be baked in this manner. 
However, the small pea beans are the best for " Boston 
baked beans." The Lima and large white beans are best 
for the deep earthen dish. Uncover the beans while baking 
the last hour to brown those on top. 

BAKED PINTO BEANS 

2 cupfuls pinto beans. 
y2 teaspoonful soda. 
Yi pound salt pork. 

1 onion. 

2 teaspoonfuls salt. 
Pinch of ground mustard. 
1 tablespoonful molasses. 

Pick over beans, cover with cold water, and soak over 
night. In the morning drain, add fresh water to cover and 
one-half teaspoonful of soda, and put on the fire. As soon 
as the beans come to the boiling point drain and pour cold 
water over them, rinsing thoroughly. This gives them the 
firmness which keeps thent from getting mushy. Drain 
the beans. Scald rind of salt pork, scrape, remove one- 
fourth inch slice and put in bottom of bean-pot. Cut through 
rind of remaining pork every one-half inch, making cuts 
one inch deep. Cut onion into small pieces, add to beans, 

101 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



put beans in pot and bury pork in beans leaving rind ex- 
posed. Mix salt, mustard and molasses, add one cupful 
of boiling water and pour over beans, then add enough more 
boiling water to cover beans. Cover bean-pot, put in oven, 
and bake slowly 6 to 8 hours, uncovering the last hour of 
cooking, that rind may become brown and crisp. As the 
water boils out. add more; be sure to add boiling water 
as cold water would retard the cooking and toughen the 
skins. 

BAKED BEAN LOAF 

Use two cupfuls of cold Boston baked beans; crush the 
beans through a colander with a pestle or leave them whole ; 
add one well-beaten egg, two tablespoonfuls of tomato cat- 
sup, one cupful of soft (sifted) bread crumbs, one table- 
spoonful of chopped or scraped onion with salt and pepper 
to season ; mix all together thoroughly, then shape into a 
loaf. Set in a greased dish, with a slice of bacon or fat 
salt pork on the top of the loaf. Bake about twenty-five 
minutes. Serve hot in the baking dish. 

DRIED SHELL BEANS 

Soak one cupful dried beans over night, drain, and cook 
in boiling salted water until soft; drain, add three-fourths 
cupful of cream, and season with butter and salt. Reheat 
before serving. 

SPAGHETTI AND KIDNEY BEANS 

1 cupful spaghetti. 

2 cupfuls dried kidney beans. 

3 tablespoonfuls margarine. 

2 cupfuls stewed tomatoes. 

3 tablespoonfuls corn flour. 
2 teaspoonfuls salt. 

}i teaspoon ful pepper. 

102 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Wash and soak the beans overnight, add one teaspoon fiil 
of salt, and cook them until tender. Break the spaghetti into 
pieces about an inch long and cook in boiling, salted water 
until soft. Drain and pour cold water through it. Make a 
tomato sauce. Melt the margarine, add the flour and cook 
till bubbling. Add the tomato and cook all until thickened. 
Mix together the spaghetti and beans, add seasonings and 
sauce, and serve hot. 

GREEN LIMA BEANS 

Cover 1 quart of the shelled beans with boiling water. 
Place on the fire where they will boil up quickly, then draw

SQUASH 

The various varieties of the summer squash are generally 
cooked when so small and tender that the thumb nail can 
pierce the rind easily. 

To prepare for the table wash the squash, cut into small 
pieces, and either cook in boiling water or steam it. It will 
cook in boiling water in half an hour. It takes about an 
hour to cook it in the steamer. The cooked squash is 
mashed fine and seasoned with salt, pepper and butter.

VEGETABLE HASH 

Hash may be made with one or many cooked vegetables, 
the vegetable or vegetables being used alone or combined 
with meat or fish. Potato is the most useful vegetable for 
a hash, as it combines well with animal food or with other 
vegetables. 

To make good hash, the vegetables should be cut fairly 
fine, but not so fine that the pieces lose their shape or stick 
together. Each vegetable must be cut up separately, then 
all be mixed. The vegetables and meat or fish must be well 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and if liked there may be 
added a little minced onion, chives, parsley, or green pepper 
finely minced. The hash should be moistened a little with 
meat broth, milk, or water (not more than half a cupful 
for a quart of hash). When the hash is mixed, seasoned, 
and moistened, put a tablespoon ful of butter or drippings 
in a frying pan. When this is melted i)Ut in the hash, and 
spread evenly and lightly in the pan. Over this put small 
pieces of butter or drippings, using about one tablespoonful 
in all. Cover the pan and place where the hash wnll not 
burn, but will cook slowly half an hour, then fold and 
turn in hot platter. A rich, brown crust will have formed 
on the bottom of the hash if the heat was sufficient. Serve 
very hot. The plates on which hash is served should be hot.

CHAPTER Vn 

POTATOES* 

The potato is a starchy food that contains enough mois- 
ture to cook the starch. This moisture is in the form of a 
watery juice, in which is dissoh^ed the nitrogenous matter, 
the various sahs, sugar, gum, etc. The starch cells are 
surrounded and penetrated by this watery bath. In cook- 
ing, the starch granules swell and burst, and the starch 
absorbs the watery part of the juice. When this stage is 
reached, if the moisture has been in the right proportion, 
all parts of the potato will present a Hght, dry, glistening 
appearance. Such a potato will not cause digestive disturb- 
ance. However, the moisture is not always in the right 
proportion. Ripe potatoes and potatoes grown on a well- 
drained or sandy soil will, as a rule, be dry and mealy if 
properly cooked. Potatoes grown in a wet season or in a 
heavy, damp soil as a rule contain too large a proportion 
of moisture for the starch. Old potatoes that are allowed 
to sprout will be watery, probably owing to the withdrawal 
of some of the starch for food for the growing sprouts. 

Potatoes cooked in dry heat, as by baking in the oven, 
roasting in ashes, frying in deep fat, or steaming in their 
jackets, retain all their salts and other constituents, and the 
flavor is more pronounced and savory than when cooked in 
water. But potatoes so cooked must be served just as soon 
as they are done, or else they will become soggy and bad 
flavored. 

Potatoes cooked in the skin should be free from any 
blemish and washed absolutely clean. Old potatoes, that 
is, potatoes that are kept into the spring and early summer, 
are better for being soaked in cold water and peeled before 
cooking.

BAKED POTATOES 

Select potatoes having a smooth surface. Wash perfectly 
clean and let them drain. Put them in an old baking pan 
kept for this purpose — do not crowd them — and put in a 
hot oven. K the oven is large and hot and the potatoes of 
medium size, forty minutes will answer for the cooking. 
On the other hand, if the oven is filled with cold potatoes 
the temperature of the oven will be reduced quickly and it 
will require an hour to cook the potatoes. Baked potatoes 
should be served as soon as they are done, li they must be 
kept any time after the cooking is completed, break them in 
order that the moisture may escape. Keep them in a warm 
oven or covered with cheese cloth in a pan. 

BOILED POTATOES 

The method and time given for boiling potatoes are the 
same whether the potato is peeled, partially peeled, or left 
with the skin intact. Ha dozen or two ordinary sized 
potatoes are put on the fire in a large stewpan and are cov- 
ered generously with boiling water and a cover is imme- 
diately put on the stewpan, they will be cooked in thirty 
minutes. Small potatoes will cook in two minutes less time, 
and very large potatoes will require about thirty-five min- 
utes' cooking. H the potatoes are to be boiled in their 
skins, wash them until clean, and then with a sharp knife 
cut a narrow band of the skin from the center of the potato. 
Cut a little bit of the skin from each end of the potato. H 
the potatoes are to be peeled, use a very sharp knife and 
remove the thinnest possible layer. The skins may be 
scraped ofif, if preferred, and there are special knives for 
this purpose. Let the potatoes boil fifteen minutes, then 
add 1 tablespoon ful of salt for every dozen potatoes. When 
the potatoes have been cooking thirty minutes, drain off 
every drop of water and let all the steam pass off. They 
are now ready to serve, though they will not be injured,

but, in fact, will be improved by being kept hot for an hour 
or more, if they are well ventilated in such a way that they 
dry rather than retain moisture. 

When boiled or steamed potatoes miust be kept warm 
for any length of time, place the stewpan on the range on a 
tripod or iron ring and cover the potatoes with one thick- 
ness of cheese cloth. This will protect them from the cold 
air and allow the moisture to pass ofif. 



MASHED POTATOES 

Take boiled potatoes and put them through a potato ricer, 
add butter, hot milk, pepper and salt, and beat with a potato 
masher or large spoon until flufify. Heap lightly in a dish

SWEET POTATO PUFF 

To 2 cupfuls mashed potato add beaten yolk of 1 egg, 
Yi cupful cream and a little salt. Beat well and add the 
stiffly beaten white of the egg. Heap in a loaf on a but- 
tered dish, brush with white of egg, and brown in a hot 
oven. 

SWEET POTATO (Southern Style) 

Bake medium-sized potatoes; when they are soft, cut in 
two lengthwise and scoop out the inside with a spoon. Put 
it through a potato ricer; add butter, salt, pepper, and 
enough cream to moisten. Whip with a fork until light 
and fluffy, refill the skins, heaping the potato into rough 
little mounds, and bake delicately brown.

CHAPTER Vni 

EGGS 

Eggs are a valuable animal food composed of water 
protein, fat and mineral matter. The white of egg on beat- 
ing entangles a large amount of air, and this is a help in 
making light omelets and cakes. The albumen coagulates 
on heating, and makes the egg a thickening agent for cust- 
ards and sauces. More air may be entangled in the albu- 
men by beating the white and yolk separately. 

There are a number of household tests of the freshness 
of eggs. The most reliable is to candle them. Hold the 
egg in the hand with the fingers wrapped about it and look 
through it against a bright light; in a perfectly fresh egg 
you can see the yolk like a golden ball and the white about 
it clear as water. Or, drop an egg into a basin of water; 
if perfectly fresh, it will sink and rest on its side, li it 
rolls around standing on its end, it is comparatively fresh; 
if it floats, discard it unopened. 

PRESERVATION OF EGGS 

In March, April, May and June eggs are most plentiful 
and cheap. Thrifty housewives will then "put theinj down" 
for fall and winter. Eggs are valuable not only for protein, 
but for iron, phosphorus and other growth and repair 
material. 

To preserve eggs, air must be excluded by covering them 
with water glass, lime water, strong brine, fat, paraffin, 
etc., or by packing them in coarse salt, bran or clean oats. 
When dry methods are used, pack with small end down to 
keep air chamber moist. This precaution is not necessary 
with liquids. 

123 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Eggs to be packed must be fresh, preferably infertile, 
clean and free from cracks. If the filmy outer covering of 
the shell is dissolved by washing, the egg spoils more rapid- 
ly. One cracked egg will spoil many others. 

W^ater glass usually is the first choice ; lime, second ; bran, 
salt or even clean oats, third, li eggs are infertile and if 
the cellar is clean and moist (not damp), eggs will keep 
manv weeks if wrapped only in paper or even not covered 
at all — small end down, preferably. 

Water glass may be bought at the drug store or poultry 
supply stores. To 1 c{uart of water glass add 9 quarts of 
boiled and cooled water for an 8-gallon jar holding at least 
15 dozen eggs. Fill containers half full, add eggs care- 
fully. Be sure to keep two inches of liquid above the top 
layer. Cover and keep in a cool place, li the liquid evap- 
orates, replace it with cool, boiled water. Liquid can be 
used only one year. After removing from liquid, eggs will 
keep at least two weeks. They are good for boiling or 
poaching until November (before boiling prick shell with a 
needle) ; for frying until December; then for omelets, 
scrambled eggs, custards, cakes, and general cookery. 

DESSICATED EGGS, EGG POWDER AND EGG SUBSTITUTES* 

Different methods of evaporating or dessicating whole 
tgg yolks and whites have been proposed and several pro- 
ducts which claim to be thus prepared are now on the mar- 
ket. It is said that the tgg is dried in or out of a vacuum, 
usually by a gentle heat or by currents of air. When 
placed on the market the dried egg is usually ground. 
Sometimes salt, sugar, or both have been used as preserva- 
tives. Such material is merely egg from which the bulk of 
the water has been removed. If the process of manufac- 
ture is such that the product is palatal^le and keeps well, the 
value of evaporated eggs under many circumstances is 
evident. 

*Extract from Farmers' Bulletin 128, "Eggs and Their Uses as 
Foods." 

124 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



This material is used by bakers to some extent as being 
cheaper when fresh eggs are high in price. It is also used 
in provisioning camps and expeditions, since dessicated 
foods have the advantage of a higher nutritive value in 
proportion to their bulk than the same materials when fresh. 
If all the water is removed in preparing evaporated eggs, 
one pound will furnish nutritive material equivalent to about 
four pounds of fresh eggs. One commercial product ap- 
pears to be dried eggs coarsely ground. For use it is thor- 
oughly mixed with a small quantity of water. The mixture 
can then be fried or made into an omelet, etc., and is very 
palatable, closely resembling in taste the same dishes made 
from fresh eggs. 

An egg substitute has been manufactured from skimi milk. 
It is said to contain the casein and albumen of the milk 
mixed with a little flour, and is put up in the form of a 
paste or powder. Such material is evidently rich in protein 
and, according to reports — apparently reliable — is used in 
considerable quantities by bakers and confectioners in place 
of fresh eggs. 

Egg substitutes have been devised which consist of mix- 
tures of animal or vegetable fats, albumen, starch or flour, 
coloring matter, and some leavening powder in addition to 
the mineral matter similar to those found in the egg. Such 
products are designed to resemble eggs in composition. 

Other egg substitutes have been marketed which contain 
little or no albumen, but apparently consist quite largely of 
starch, colored more or less with some yellow substance. 
These goods are especially recommended for making cust- 
ards and puddings similar in appearance to those in which 
fresh eggs are used. There is no reason to suppose that 
such products can not be made so that they will be perfectly 
wholesome. The fact must not be overlooked that in the 
diet they cannot replace fresh eggs, since they do not con- 
tain much nitrogenous matter or fat. This may be an im- 
portant matter if such an egg substitute is used in the diet

of invalids, especially if the composition of the egg sub- 
stitute is not known, and it is employed with the belief that, 
like eggs, it contains an abundance of protein. 

COOKING AND SERVING EGGS 

The methods of serving eggs alone or in combination with 
other food materials are very numerous. Cooked in vari- 
ous ways, they are a favorite animal food, taking the place 
of meat to a certain extent, while raw eggs, usually seasoned 
in some way, are by no means infrequently eaten. Eggs 
are combined with other materials in various ways in many 
dishes. They are used in making cakes and such foods to 
improve their flavor, color and texture, wdiile in custards, 
creams, etc., they thicken the mlaterial and give the desired 
consistency. The white of the egg is also employed in 
making icings and confectionery. Well-beaten or whipped 
egg white is used to leaven many forms of cakes and similar 
foods, as well as to improve the flavor. The beaten white. 
incloses air in small bubbles, which become distributed 
throughout the mass of dough in mixing. The heat of 
cooking expands the air and makes the walls of the air 
bubbles firm, so that the porous structure is retained. The 
power to inclose and retain air when beaten varies, being 
greatest in the fresh egg and much lessened in packed or 
old eggs. Convenient leavening pow^ders have lessened the 
number of eggs used for this purpose. Sponge cake, how- 
ever, is a familiar example of food so leavened. 

This use of eggs explains some of the recipes in old cook- 
ery books which call for such large numbers of eggs. 

There are several simple ways of cooking eggs which are 
very commonly followed. Thus, the egg in the shell is 
cooked by immersion in hot or boiling water or is less com- 
monly roasted. After removal from the shell, the egg is 
cooked in hot water or in hot fat. In the latter case it may 
or may not be beaten or stirred. Combined with other 
materials to form] various made dishes, eggs are boiled, 
baked, steamed, or fried, as the case may be. The total 

126 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



number of methods of serving and preparing eggs is very 
large, but in nearly every case it will be found that the 
method of preparation is only a more or less elaborate 
modification of one of the simple methods of cooking. 



HARD AND SOFT COOKED EGGS 

To cook eggs so that they will be firm all the way through 
and yet not tough or indigestible, put them in a saucepan of 
boiling water, cover closely and place on a part of the stove 
where the water will remain very hot. but not boil, and let 
stand for thirty minutes. 

To cook eggs so that they will be soft, follow the above 
directions, but let the eggs remain only six minutes. 

POACHED EGGS 

A deep spider is the best utensil in which to poach eggs. 
Fill it nearly full of boiling water which has been slightly 
salted. Break egg in a saucer, and drop into water, cooking 
slowly, until the white is like jelly. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

4 eggs. 

^ teaspoon ful salt. 

Dash pepper. 

y^ cupful milk. 

Beat the eggs just enough to break them up ; they do not 
need to be light or frothy. Put the butter into an omelet 
pan, and when it is brown pour in the egg and milk. Scrape 
the cooked eggs from the bottom of the pan, tipping it so 
the uncooked egg will run down on the hot iron. Double it 
over before it begins to get brown, and serve very hot. 

EGGS IN NEST 

Separate as many eggs as are needed for this dish, and 
beat the whites to a stitT froth. Drop in spoonfuls on a flat 
buttered baking dish, dust with pepper and salt here and 
there, in the middle of the white, slide in carefully the raw 
yolks. Put a bit of butter on each yolk. Place the dish in 

127 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



a hot oven for eight minutes. Serve immediately. H de- 
sired, the froth may be piled into individual dishes with the 
yolk in the center of each and baked as described. 

PLAIN OMELET 

4 eggs. 

4 tablespoonfuls hot water. 

1 tablespoon ful butter. 

Pepper and salt. 

Separate the whites from the yolks, beat the yolks with 
an egg beater till thick, and whip the whites with a wire 
whisk to a stiff froth. To the yolks add the seasonings and 
hot water. Last of all blend in the beaten whites. Heat 
an omelet pan and grease with butter, pour in the egg mix- 
ture, set it where it will cook slowly, turning the pan around 
that omelet may brown all over. When puffed and deli- 
cately browned on the bottom, take it from the fire and set 
on the top grate of the oven for a few minutes to cook. 
Press it with your finger; if none of the egg mixture clings, 
omelet is cooked. Score lightly down the center, and turn 
out on a hot platter. 

BREAD OMELET 

6 eggs. 

3 tablespoonfuls stale bread crumbs. 

1 cupful milk. 

Pepper and salt. 

lJ/4 tablespoonfuls butter. 

Scald the milk, pour over the crumbs and allow it to soak, 
beat the whites and yolks separately until very light. Stir 
the crumb mixture into the yolks, add the seasoning, then 
cut in with a palette knife the whites beaten to a stiff froth. 
Pour into a deep buttered baking dish, and bake in a hot 
oven till browned on top. 

128 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



POTATO OMELET 

1 cupful mashed potatoes. 

^ teaspoon ful pepper. 

3 tablespoonfuls cream or milk. 

1 teaspoon ful salt. 

3 eggs. 

Wash eggs, and separate the whites and yolks. Add the 
yolks to the potatoes and beat until there are no lumps. 
Season with onion juice, if desired, and chopped parsley. 
Beat the whites until stiff and fold into the potato mixture. 
Put into a well-greased frying pan and bake in oven until 
brown. Then turn and fold on hot platter. Serve at once. 

EGG TIMBALES 

4 eggs. 

2 tablespoonfuls chopped parsley or chopped ham. 
Salt and pepper. 

4 tablespoonfuls milk or thin cream. 

Tomato or white sauce. 

Beat the eggs just enough to thoroughly mix yolks and 
whites, add the salt, pepper and the milk or cream. 

Grease very small cups or moulds and sprinkle the bot- 
toms and sides with the parsley or ham, pour in enough egg 
to nearly fill each cup, and stand in a pan of almost boiling 
water. Cook either in a moderate oven or over a slow fire, 
that the water may not boil and cause the timbales to be- 
come "honeycombed." As soon as a knife can be inserted 
in the timbales and drawn out clean, they are done. Serve 
on individual plates with sauce around them. 

CHEESE SOUFFLE 

3 tablespoonfuls flour. 
3 tablespoonfuls butter. 
3 eggs. 

1 cupful milk. 

1 cupful grated cheese. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

129 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Put the butter and flour together in a saucepan and stir 
until blended. Add the milk, slowly, and stir till the mix- 
ture boils ; then add the grated cheese, salt and pepper, and 
set aside to cool. Beat the eggs, yolks and whites separ- 
ately ; then add the yolks to the mixture in the saucepan and 
blend thoroughly. Lastly, fold in the beaten whites, and 
turn the soufile into a well-greased baking dish. Bake in a 
moderate oven about twenty-five minutes, and serve at once 
to prevent its falling. 

CURRIED EGGS 

6 hard-cooked eggs. 

1 small onion. 

2 tablespoon fuls butter or drippings. 
1 tablespoon ful flour. 

^ sour apple or a teaspoon ful of lemon juice. 

Yi teaspoon ful salt. 

^Yi cupfuls water, stock or milk. 

1 tablespoon ful curry powder. 

Hard cook the eggs, remove the shells and cut the eggs in 
slices. Melt the butter or drippings and cook in it the 
onion, finely chopped ; add flour and curry powder and cook 
three minutes. Add the stock, water or milk slowly, and 
stir until sauce boils. Add the apple or lemon juice and 
cook slowly twenty minutes. Season and heat the slices of 
egg in the sauce. 

EGGS IN TOMATO CUPS 

For each serving allow one ^g% and one medium-sized 
tomato. Cut a slice from the stem end of the tomato and 
with a spoon scoop out the center. Sprinkle the cavity with 
buttered cracker crumbs. Break and carefully drop one 
^^g into each tomato. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
cover with buttered crumbs. Place on a buttered pan and 
bake in a moderate oven until the eggs are set and the 
crumbs are brown.

the mixture and carefully break over it six eggs. Pour 
over them one tablespoonful melted butter, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, and bake in a moderate oven until the 
whites are set. 

SCUFFLED EGG WITH HAM 

For each serving cut a round of bread three inches in 
diameter; toast it. spread with finely chopped ham mois- 
tened with milk, stock, or gravy; add a few grains of salt to 
the white of an egg, and beat very stiff. Mound on the 
ham, make a depression in the center, put in the yolk, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, and bake in a moderate oven 
until the egg is firm. 

When several servings are to be prepared, keep the yolks 
in separate dishes until needed, but beat the whites together.

CHAPTER IX 

SOUPS 
SOUPS WITH STOCK 

Soups are divided into two classes — soups with stock and 
soups without — and the variations wdiich can l^e made from 
these are numberless. With a pot of stock on hand and the 
assistance of vegetables for stockless soups, even in a frugal 
home there may be a soup for every day in the year. Be- 
sides, there are excellent soups made from fish, and satis- 
fving chowders with the addition of potatoes which make 
the dish a full meal. 

In recipes for making stock, the ingredients for seasoning 
seem endless. Spices, such as mace, bay leaves, peppers, 
etc., are inexpensive, so are the winter vegetables that most 
recipes call for, and they may be kept constantly on hand. 
In a family where there is a meat dish once a day, little fresh 
meat is recjuired for the stock pot if all bones and scraps are 
saved and utilized. Every mprsel of a stew, roast with its 
gravv, chop and steak bones, bones of chicken or game, and 
the trimmings from meat, which a housewife pays for and 
should insist on having, are all grist for the soup pot. The 
meats to avoid using are bits of raw lamb or mutton with 
fat on them, which give a disagreeable flavor, also smoked 
or corned meat. Scraps of bacon, cold ham. or even calf's 
liver may be added ; they give a touch of good flavoring. 

Eor a fine-flavored, good-colored soup, save all the scraps 
and keep in a clean jar in the refrigerator, making soup 
twice a week. Never add a morsel of anything that has the 
slightest taint. Break bones thoroughly. If you would ex- 
tract all the flavor from bits of meat, put them through a 
chopper. With a skewer pick marrow from the bones. 
Eay the bones at the bottom of the pot. 

135 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



it there are any lett-overs in the refrigerator ot such 
vegetables as onions, celery, tomatoes, carrots, chop V'y 
cupful each of carrot, turnip and celery, and add for flavor- 
ing, with ^ teaspoonful peppercorns, 1 bay leaf, sprig of 
parsley, 6 cloves, and 1 chopped onion. Do not add salt 
till the stock is half cooked. 

Cover the bones with cold water and set far back on the 
stove where it will come to the boil slowly. Let it simmer 
five or six hours, strain through a fine sieve, and cool as 
quickly as possible. Do not remove the cake of fat from 
the top of the soup until you are ready to use it, then run a 
thin knife around the edge to loosen it. Cut into quarters 
and lift each piece carefully. If there are any grains of 
fat left on the top of the jellied stock, dampen a bit of 
cheese cloth and carefully wipe over the top. 

For an everyday family soup in which nourishment is 
the first consideration, do not clear. In the sediment there 
is considerable nutriment. If it is to be cleared, set the 
strained, skimmed soup over the fire, mix with the white 
and crushed shell of one egg, a dash of celery seed and 
pepper and salt if required. Mix thoroughly, heat, and 
boil ten minutes. Just before taking from the fire, pour 
in ^ cupful of cold water. Pour through cheese cloth, 
and heat again to the boiling point before using.

Cut in rather small pieces all the meat from shin of beef ; 
break the bone in pieces, and put into a large pot with 
bacon, onions, carrots, turnip, celery, parsley, thyme, salt, 
cloves, pepper, butter. Add cold water, let stand thirty 
minutes, then set it on the fire, where it will simmer slowly 
for six hours, skimming very often. Strain carefully 
through a fine sieve, not bruising the vegetables. Next 
morning skim off the fat. You can make a variety of 
soups from this stock by adding to it noodles, macaroni or 
finelv cut ves:etables. 



CONSOMME

Cover the meat with water, and simmer four hours. Add 
the other ingredients, and cook one hour longer. Strain 
and let stand overnight. Next day skim off the grease, add 
the white and shell of one egg to clear it, boil up, strain 
again, and serve.

throw away the water. Wash thoroughly bones and meat 
in cold water; return to kettle, add vegetables, seasonings, 
and 3 quarts boiling" water. Boil three or four hours; the 
stock should be reduced one-half. (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

JELLIED SOUP 

Beef or other soup stock may be chilled and served cold 
in summer. The stock is cleared with ^gg white to make 
it attractive. Mix together a quart of stock and the shell 
and white of one ^gg. Heat gradually and stir constantly 
until a thick scum forms on the top. Let stand for a few 
minutes, then strain the soup through a napkin or other 
fine cloth. The soup must be made with considerable bone 
if it is to jelly. If it is not firm enough, it can be stiff- 
ened with gelatine in the proportion of a tablespoon ful of 
gelatine softened in two tablespoonfuls of water for each 
three cupfuls of soup. The jellied soup must be rather 
highly seasoned, and a small amount of caramel coloring 
will give the desired tint to a pale soup. 

OXTAIL SOUP 

Separate the joints of two oxtails, wash carefully. Put 
in a soup kettle, cover with cold water and heat slowly to 
the boiling point. .Simmer for one hour. Then add two 
carrots, two small turnips and one onion, all sliced. Tie 
together in a bit of cheese cloth a sprig of parsley, a bit of 
garlic, a small bay leaf, and six peppercorns, and place in 
the stock. Add enough salt to season. When the meat is 
quite tender, remove it from the stock and take out all the

CHAPTER X 

FISH* 

The chief uses of fish as food are ( 1 ) to furnish an 
economical source of nitrogenous nutrients and (2) to 
supply the demand for variety in the diet, which increases 
with the advance of civilization. 

Kinds. — Fish are classified as vertebrates, or fish proper, 
those having a backbone; and shellfish. Those having a 
backbone are divided into two classes; white fish and oily 
fish. 

In the white fish, the fat is found only in the liver; in oily 
fish, the fat is found distributed throughout the entire 
body. 

^^'hite-fleshed fish include whitefish, cod, perch, pickerel, 
sunfish, smelts, croppies, soles, brook trout, and black bass. 
Oily fish include salmon, lake trout, shad, herring, mackerel, 
halibut, and eels. 

Points to be Observed in Choosing Fish. — Firm flesh, 
bright eyes, red gills, firm tail, fresh odor. A slice of fish 
should hold its shape. Lobsters, clams, oysters, crabs 
should be alive in the shell. 

Of the very large quantity of fish annually placed on 
the American market, the greater part is consumed at home, 
although a portion is prepared in various ways for ex- 
port. 

The preference for fresh- water or salt-water fish is a mat- 
ter of individual taste. Both are, so far as known, equally 
wholesome. It may be said that in general the preference 
for one kind of sea food or another is quite largely a 

^Extract from Farmers' Bulletin No. 85, "Fish as a Food." 

149 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



matter of circumstances. It is noticeable that many kinds 
of fish which are known to be good for food are seldom 
eaten. Among others may be mentioned the whiting, or 
silver hake, and the sea robin. The latter are taken in 
enormous cjuantities in certain regions. This prejudice 
against certain fish is largely local ; for instance, skates are 
eaten on the western coast of the United States, but until 
recently they were regarded as of no value in the East. A 
few years ago sturgeon and eel were not generally eaten. 
To-day sturgeon is much prized, and in regions where it 
was formerly worthless commands a high price. Many 
persons have a prejudice against frogs legs, while others 
consider them a great delicacy. In the United States they 
are now very commonly eaten, and frog-raising for the mar- 
ket is more or less of an industry. An interesting change of 
opinion regarding the use of a sea product may be noted 
in the case of abalone, a large mollusk abundant on the 
California coast, which was formerly disregarded as a 
food product by Americans, but which, it is said owing to 
its use by the Chinese, has become known and is relished. 

Conditions Which i\FFECT the Market Value 
OF Fish 

The market value of fish is affected by various condi- 
tions. Among these are the locality from which they come, 
the season in which they are taken, and the food on which 
they have grown. In general, it may be said that fish from 
clear, cold, or deep water are regarded as preferable to 
those from shallow or warm water. \\n'iile fish taken 
in waters with a rocky or sandy bottom are preferable to 
those from water with a muddy bottom. Some fish, for 
instance shad, are at their best during the spawning season, 
while others should not be eaten during this period. Those 
fish which feed on small Crustacea and the other forms of 
animal and vegetable life, constituting their natural food, 
are preferable to those living upon sewage and other matter 
which may contaminate the waters.

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



The mode of capture also affects the market vahie. Fish 
caught by the gills and allowed to die in the water by slow- 
degrees, as is the case where gill nets are used, undergo 
decomposition very readily and are inferior for food. 
Fish are often landed alive and allowed to die slowly. This 
custom is not only inhumane, but lessens the value of the 
fish. It has been found that fish killed immediately after 
catching remain firm and bear shipment better than those 
allowed to die slowly. The Cjuality of the fish is often 
injured by improper handling in the fishing boats before 
placing on the market. Improvements in transportation 
facilities and in other lines have made it possible to bring 
fish to market from distant fishing grounds in good con- 
dition. 

Fresh water and salt w^ater fish alike are offered for 
sale as taken from the water, and preserved in a number 
of ways. In some cases preservation is only to insure 
transportation to remote points in ^ood condition. Low 
temperature is the means most commonly employed for 
this purpose. By taking advantage of the recent improve- 
ments in apparatus and methods of chilling and freezing, 
fish may be shipped long distances and kept a long time in 
good condition. 

According to the practice of a successful firm dealing in 
frozen fish, the fish, as they are unloaded from the boats, 
are sorted and graded as to size and quality, then placed 
in galvanized iron pans about 2 feet long, covered with 
loosely fitting lids, and frozen by keeping them twenty- 
four hours at a temperature often as low as 16° below 
zero. The fish are removed from the pans in a solid cake 
and packed in tiers in the storehouse and marketed frozen. 
It is said that they may be thus preserved indefinitely, 
though as a rule frozen fish are only kept six to eight 
months, being frozen in the spring, when the supply is 
abundant, and sold in the winter or whenever fresh fish 

151 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



can not be readily obtained. Such frozen fish are com- 
monly shipped in barrels packed with broken ice in such 
a manner that the water formed by the melting ice may 
readily escape. 

Oysters and other shellfish are placed on the market alive 
in the shell or are removed from the shell and kept in good 
condition by chilling or other means. Oysters in the shell 
are usually transported in barrels or sacks. Shipment is 
made to far inland points in refrigerator cars and to Europe 
in the cold-storage chambers of vessels. Large quantities 
of shellfish are also canned. Oysters are often sold as they 
are taken from the salt water. However, the practice of 
"freshing," "fattening," or "floating" is very widespread — 
that is, oysters are placed in fresh or brackish water for a 
short period. They become plump in appearance and have 
a different flavor from those taken directly from salt water. 
Care should be taken that the oysters are grown and fat- 
tened in water which is not contaminated by sewage. 

Lobsters, crabs, and other Crustacea are usually sold alive. 
Sometimes they are boiled before they are placed on the 
market. Large quantities of lobsters, shrimps, and crabs 
are canned. 

PREPARING FISH FOR THE TABLE 

Fish is prepared for the table in a variety of ways. Fish 
is comnionly boiled, steamed, broiled, fried, or baked, or 
may be combined with other materials in some made dish. 

In most cases fat or carbohydrates in the form of butter, 
flour, or other materials are added to fish when cooked, and 
thus the deficiency in fuel ingredients is made good. Boiled 
or steamed fish is often accompanied by a rich sauce, made 
from butter, eggs, etc. Fried fish is cooked in fat, and 
baked fish is often filled with force meat, and may also be 
acconnpanied by a sauce; the force meat being made of 
bread, butter, etc., contains fat and carbohydrates. In 
made dishes — chowders, fish pies, salads, etc. — fat and car- 
l)ohydrates (butter, flour, vegetables, etc.) are combined 

152 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



with fish, the kind and amount varying in the individual 
cases. Furthermore, in the ordinary household fish or 
meat is supplemented by such foods as bread, butter, pota- 
toes, green vegetables, and fruit. That is, by adding ma- 
terials in cooking and by serving other dishes with the 
cooked product the protein of the fish is supplemented by 
the necessary fat and carbohydrates.

To Boil Fish. — Boiling is the most insipid way of cook- 
ing fish, yet there are certain varieties that are better cooked 
this way if accompanied by a rich sauce. Fish, if boiled 
in a common kettle, should first be wrapped in cheese cloth 
to preserve its shape. Boiled fish should be served with a 
sauce. The water should be salted and 1 tablespoon ful 
lemon juice or vinegar may be added to keep the fish white. 
A boiled fish may be stuffed if desired. (12-20 minutes 
per pound.) 

To Bake FisJi. — A baked fish presents a more attractive 
appearance when served in an upright position on the plat- 
ter; it also cooks better. To keep it upright, press it down 
enough to flatten the under side, then, if necessary, brace 
W'ith skewers or potatoes placed against it until it is well 
under way for cooking, then it will keep its position until 
cooked and dished. Lay over the back and in the pan 
small strips of salt pork, add 1 cupful hot water, and baste 
often while baking. (20-30 minutes per pound.) 

To Fry Fish. — Clean the fish and wipe perfectly dry; 
then dip in beaten egg and afterwards in bread crumbs or 
cornmeal, but preferably in the crumbs, patting these on 
well that no loose ones may fall ofif and burn in the fat; 
then plunge the fish, a few pieces at a time, in the fat, which 
must be smoking hot, and of which there must be sufficient 
in the pan to completely cover the fish. Cook golden brown, 
and drain well before serving. (5-7 minutes per pound.) 

Broih'd Fish. — Bluefish, cod. haddock, and mackerel are 
split down the back and broiled whole, removing head and 

154 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



tail if desired. Salmon, halibut, and swordfish are cut in 
inch slices for broiling. Smelt and other small fish are 
broiled whole without splitting, but the entrails are removed 
carefully so as not to bruise the fish. Clean and wipe the 
fish, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and place in a well- 
greased wire broiler, cooking the fiesh side first. Turn it 
and cook the skin until crisp. Sliced fish should be turned 
often while broiling, slip upon a hot platter, or place platter 
over fish and invert platter and broiler together. 

Small fish re(iuire 10 to 15 minutes for broiling. 

Large fish re(|uire 1 5 to 20 minutes for broiling. 

BAKED HADDOCK WITH STUFFING 

Clean a four-pound haddock, sprinkle with salt inside and 
out, stuff and sew. Cut five diagonal gashes on each side 
of backbone and insert narrow strips of fat salt pork, hav- 
ing gashes on one side come between gashes on other side. 
Shape with skewers in form of letter "S," and fasten skew- 
ers with small twine. Place on greased fish-sheet in a 
dripping-pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, brush over with 
melted butter, dredge with flour, and place around fish 
small pieces of fat salt pork. Bake one hour in hot oven, 
basting as soon as fat is tried out, and continue basting 
every ten minutes. Serve with drawn butter, egg or Hol- 
landaise sauce.

add the remainder of the hquor and milk and cover with 
crumbs. Never make more than two layers of oysters, for 
oysters should be evenly cooked through. Bake thirtv min- 
utes in a hot oven. A sprinkling of nutmeg to each layer 
adds flavor. 



TO BOIL LOBSTER 

Put a handful of salt into a kettle of boiling water, into 
which place the lobster head first. Boil from twenty to 
thirty minutes, according to size. Too long or too rapid 
boiling will make the meat tough and stringy. 

In buying a lobster, choose one that is heavy for its size : 
very large ones are likely to be tough. 

TO DRESS A LOBSTER (Janet McKenzie Hill) 

Pull off the two large claws and the four pairs of small 
claws, break apart the tail and body; cut the bony mem- 
brane on the inside of the tail shell with a pair of scissors 
or sardine can opener ; then spread the tail slightly and pull 
out the tlesh in a single piece; open this in the crease on the 
under side and carefully remove the intestinal vein, which 
runs the entire length. This vein is always visible, but it 
differs in color, being white or red. or sometimes from the 
contents, black. Take the body from the shell, leaving 
within the shell the stomach or lady. If the coral and 
green substance remain in the shell, shake them out and set 
aside for use. Pull off the woolly gills found on the l3ody. 
then break open the body shell and remove all the bits of 
flesh found between the bones; this is the sweetest and ten- 
derest portion of the lobster. Disjoint the large claws and 
cut the shell, if thin, to remove the flesh as whole as pos- 
sible. Take the meat from the small claws with a skewer 
and leave these whole for garnishing.

CHAPTER XI 

MEAT 

Conservation of food supplies is one of the most import- 
ant problems confronting the world today. Under present 
conditions food products must be bought with economy and 
utilized with care. 

The cheaper cuts of meat heretofore have been neglected; 
possibly because people considered them not good enough, 
or did not realize their high nutritive value. 

b"or example, in considering meats we naturally think of 
the loins and ribs. These constitute only a part of the meat 
available in the animal. It is obvious that if all the avail- 
able meat is used properly the total supply of meats will 
increase in proportion, and the average price will be low- 
ered correspondingly. 

True economy consists in knowing the nature of the vari- 
ous cuts of meat as to their proportion of fat, lean, bone 
and waste. If we eliminate fat. the edible meats vary little 
in their food value. The loins and ribs, which form about 
one-fourth of the weight of the cattle, represent nearly one- 
half of the retail cost. The rational way to equalize the 
market is to use all of the meat, but the demand for center 
cuts of cjuality has so increased that the lower-priced parts 
are sadly neglected. Yet experience in making soups shows 
that a greater amount of extract and flavoring matter is 
found in these cheaper portions. 

The housewife should take advantage of the fact that 
tenderness, appearance, and convenience in cooking rather 
than actual food value largely determine retail prices. The 
facts are that the cheaper cuts of meat are by far the most 
economical from every standpoint. She can get the most 
for her money by purchasing tough cuts and serving tender 
ones through skillful methods of cooking.

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



TEXTURE AND FLAVOR OF MEAT 

"Although meats vary greatly in the amount of fat which 
they contain and to a much less degree in their protein 
content, the chief difference to be noted between the cheaper 
and more expensive cuts is not so much in their nutritive 
value as in their texture and flavor. All muscle consists of 
tiny fibers which under the microscope are seen to have the 
form of tubes. These fibers are tender in young animals 
and in those parts of older animals in which there has been 
little muscular strain. Under the backbone in the hind 
quarter is the place from which the tenderest meat comes ; 
this is usually called the tenderloin. Sometimes in beef and 
also in pork it is taken out whole, and sometimes it is left 
to be cut up with the rest of the loin. In old animals, and 
in those parts of the body where there has been much mus- 
cular action — the neck and the legs, for example — the 
muscle fibers are tough and hard. But there is another 
point which is of even greater importance than this. The 
fibers of all muscle are bound together in bundles and in 
groups of bundles by a thin membrane which is known as 
connective tissue. This membrane, if heated in w^ater or 
steam, is converted into gelatin. The process goes quickly 
if the nteat is young and tender; more slowly if it is tough. 

Flavor in meat depends mainly on certain nitrogenous 
substances wdiich are called extractives because they can be 
dissolved out or "extracted" by soaking the meat in cold 
water. The quality of the extractives and the resulting 
flavor of the meat vary with the condition of the animal 
and in different parts of its body. They are usually con- 
sidered better developed in older than in very young ani- 
mals. Many persons suppose extractives or the flavor they 
cause are best in the most expensive cuts of meat ; in reality, 
cuts on the side of beef are often of better flavor than tender' 
cuts. The extractives have little or no nutritive value in 
themselves, but they are of great importance in causing the 
secretion of digestive juices."

the Home." 

167 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



The prudent buyer considers the following points in 
choosing meats : 

( 1 ) Quality, which includes color, grain and fat. 

(2) Method of cooking, which includes flavor, fuel and 
time. 

(3) Number to be served; also whether all the meat is to 
be used at one meal or part reserved for a second serving; 
the possible use of left-overs. 

(4) The cost, which means not only the initial outlay, 
but the total cost of fuel, time and additional material. 

When meat is brought into the kitchen, either by the de- 
livery boy or by the housekeeper herself on her return from 
market, the wrapping should first be removed and the meat 
weighed to check up the household accounts. Trim ofif any 
portion of the meat that looks unsound or has a particle of 
odor. Divide the meat into the proper amount if only a 
portion of it is to be cooked that day. Wipe with a damp 
cloth, or scrape the surface of the meat with a knife, but 
avoid washing it unless necessary, for juices are lost when 
meat is placed in water. 

♦GENERAL METHODS OF PREPARING MEAT 

There are three typical methods of cooking meat : first, 
by the application of intense heat to keep in the juices, as 
by roasting, baking or broiling; second, by placing the meat 
in cold water and cooking for a long time at a low tempera- 
ture, i.e., boiling; and third, by a combination of the two 
processes, first, searing, and then afterwards stewing the 
meat. The first method is suitable only for the most tender 
cuts, young poultry, and game birds. There is a distinction 
between roasting and baking. The word roasting, properly 
speaking, applies to the old-fashioned method of cooking 
by the direct radiant heat from the open fire ; whereas bak- 
ing is cooking by heat reflected by the sides of the oven. 
The older method of roasting is now very little practised, 
and the term roasting is most often improperly applied to 

*Extract from Farmers' Bulletin 391. 

168 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



baking in an oven. The rules for the treatment of the meat, 
however, are substantially the same in both cases, and the 
two processes, therefore, may properly be dealt with to- 
gether. 

Meat which is to be roasted should never be w^ashed, but 
only wiped over on the outside with a clean, damp cloth. 
For baking it should he set on the trivet or meat stand, and 
placed in a dripping-pan large enough to project tw^o or 
three inches all around it. The mjodern double dripping- 
pan, having a close-fitting cover, with a vent to allow the 
escape of gases and steam from the meat juices, is superior 
to the old-fashioned single pan. 

An essential point in roasting or baking meat properly is 
to expose the joint or bird for the first few minutes to a 
very high temperature to sear the surface and thereby 
harden the meat on the outside so as to prevent the escape 
of the meat juices, and then to lower the temperature and 
keep it at a lower point for the remainder of the time. The 
proper temperature for a large piece of meat at the begin- 
ning is about 550 degrees Fahrenheit, but after the surface 
is well browned the temperature should be lowered to about 
400 degrees, and kept at this point until the process is fin- 
ished. To accomplish this, meat to be baked should be 
placed in the hottest part of the oven until the surface is 
thoroughly browned. Then it should be m0ved to a cooler 
part of the oven. H a gas oven is being used, the gas should 
be turned on full, in advance, and allowed to burn about 
ten minutes. Then it may be turned do\vn slightly to re- 
duce the temperature. In the absence of an oven thermome- 
ter the cook must, of course, learn by experiment the proper 
management of her own oven. 

Basting and Larding. — Meat, while being cooked, whether 
by roasting or baking, must be often basted, i.e., the melted 
fat which has run from it must be poured over its surface 
with a spoon to prevent the roast from drying out or burn- 
ing. In order to insure that there may be sufficient dripping 
for this purpose, the cook must notice whether the rrieat has 

169 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



enough fat; otherwise a httle additional fat should be put 
in the pan and also upon the top of the roast. Lean joints 
of meat, or poultry, game, and the like — which have no 
natural fat on the outside — should be larded by having slices 
of fat bacon laid over them and tied tightly with a cord to 
protect the meat from browning too rapidly. Or a piece of 
buttered paper may be used for this purpose, which should 
be taken off during the last fifteen minutes so that the sur- 
face may become brown. Larding is usually necessary for 
Lay them over the steak, and serve. 

thick pieces only. Meat baking in the oven — except for 
very small pieces — requires basting at intervals of twenty 
minutes. 

Time for Cooking a Roast. — Some experience is required 
to determine when a roast is sufficiently done. The inex- 
perienced cook should consult the Complete Time Table, 
elsewhere given. But one must also consider that the time 
required depends upon the weight and the quality of the 
roast. As a general rule, a thick piece of beef requires 
fifteen minutes to the pound, and fifteen minutes over. A 
similar piece of pork or veal will require twenty minutes to 
the pound, and fifteen minutes over; poultry, fifteen minutes 
to the pound. 

With a little experience the cook should be able to tell 
when the meat is done by piercing with a fork upon the 
outside. 

Broiling. — Broiling, like roasting, is cooking by the direct 
rays of the fire ; unlike roasting, it is adapted to small and 
thin pieces of meat, such as chops, steak, chicken, and 
smaller game birds. The w4iole of the cooking is accom- 
plished by heat applied to the outside, but so regulated as 
to allow the outside to be hardened while the inside is be- 
ing gently cooked. To accomplish perfect broiling some 
care and experience are required. In cooking on the grill, 
the state of the fire must be taken into consideration. The 
coals must be glowing, without smoke or flame. Should 
flame arise, a few drops of cold water sprinkled over the 

170 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



coals will cause them to subside. For broiling by gas, the 
gas must be lighted long enough in advance to radiate a 
strong heat, both over and under the grill. The grill should 
be greased with suet or pieces of larding pork, and the 
steak or other pieces of meat to be broiled laid on this, 
held at a proper distance from the fire, and turned once in a 
while till done. A chop or steak, when properly grilled, 
should look plump in the middle, and should be rare and 
juicy rather than dry and hard. 

For full instructions as to the time required for broiling, 
consult the Complete Time Table. But observe that, in 
general, the time is regulated, not by weight, but by the 
thickness of the meat, and is approximately as follows : for 
a steak one and one-half inches thick, underdone, fifteen 
minutes; well done, twenty minutes. For a steak one inch 
thick, underdone, twelve minutes; well done, fifteen min- 
utes. For spring chicken, fifteen minutes, squab chicken, 
ten minutes. For a lamb chop, seven minutes, and for a 
veal chop, fifteen minutes. 

CUTS OF BEEF 

The beef animal is cut in halves lengthwise along the 
back. Each half or side weighs about 450 pounds, and is 
divided into the fore and hind quarters. 

FORE QUARTER CUTS 

Neck^ — Good for mincemeat; also as a brown stew. 
Flavor and richness are added by cooking with salt pork. 

Chuck — Suitable for pot roasts, stews, casserole dishes 
and spiced beef. 

Ribs — There are seven ribs in this cut. About one-half 
is lean meat, one-third fat and one-sixth bone. The two 
ribs nearest the loin make excellent roasts. Ribs are al- 
ways roasted. 

Shank — Used mostly for soups and stews ; also for ham- 
burger steak,

Clod — Used for steaks and pot roast. 

Brisket — Used mostly for corned beef, also used for soup, 
pot roast and stew. 

Plate — Suitable for soup and pot roast. Generally used 
for making corned beef. 

HIND QUARTER CUTS 

Rump — About one-third fat and one-half lean meat. 
Generally used for steaks, corning, braising and pot roast. 

Round — A juicy cut, free from fat. The top (or inside) 
is used for steak and roasts. The bottom (or outside) is 
best chopped. 

Loin — Contains the choicest steaks and is divided into 
two portions, the short loin and the loin end. This latter 
cut contains the sirloin, pinbone and porterhouse steaks. 

Shank — Used for soup and stews. 

Flank — Practically a boneless cut. Can be used with very 
little waste. Contains the flank steak. Flank meat makes 
excellent pot pie. 

OTHER PARTS 

Heart — Braised. 

Tail used for soup. 

Tongue — Boiled. 

Kidneys — Stewed. 

Brains — Scalloped or creamed. 

Tripe — Stewed or fried. 

Suet — Tried out, used as fat. 

Thymus gland and pancreas (calfs) or sweetbreads. 

TO BROIL A STEAK

hold it over a clear fire while counting ten slowly. Turn 
the broiler and hold the other side down for the same length 
of time. Turn the meat once in ten seconds for about one

the hre, turning occasionally, until the surface is brown. 
Broil five or six minutes. When the steak is cooked, lay it 
on the platter, spread both sides with butter and sprinkle 
with salt and pepper.

1 pound round steak. 

1 teaspoon ful butter. 
1/^ teaspoon ful salt. 

34 teaspoon ful pepper. 

1/^ cupful choi)ped beef fat. 

2 onions. 

Cut the steak into four parts. Place a frying pan over 
the fire with enough beef fat to grease the pan. When 
verv hot, put in the meat and fry over a quick fire until 
brown on both sides. Remove to a hot dish. Mix butter, 
salt, and pepper. Spread this over both sides of the steak 
and set in a warm place. Put chopped beef fat in the pan 
and frv, remove the bits of fat, leaving the liquid fat in the 
pan. Add to this the onions cut in slices, season with salt, 
cover, and cook five minutes, stirring them occasionally. 
Lay them over the steak, and serve.

arrange on a hot platter, and pour this sauce around it. 

PLANKED STEAK 

Wipe, remove superfluous fat, and pan broil seven min- 
utes a porterhouse or cross-cut of the rump steak cut one 
and three fourths inches thick. Butter a plank and arrange 
a border of Duchess Potatoes close to edge, using a pastry- 
bag and rose tube. Remove steak to plank, put in a hot 
oven, and bake until steak is cooked and potatoes are 
browned. Spread steak with butter, sprinkle with salt, pep- 
per, and hnely chopped parsley. Garnish top of steak with 
sauted mushroom caps, and put around steak at equal dis- 
tances halves of small tomatoes sauted in butter and on 
top of each tomato a circular slice of cucumber. ( Fannie 
M. Farmer.) 

HAMBURG STEAK 

Two pounds round beef chopped fine; press it into a flat 
steak. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and a little onion juice ; 
flour lightly, and broil as beefsteak. Make a brown gravy 
with a little soup stock, thicken with flour, and pour around 
the steak. 

This name is commonly given to inexpensive cuts of beef 
chopped, seasoned a little, shaped into small balls or into 
one large thin cake, and quickly broiled in the way that a 
tender steak would be. Owing to the quick cooking much 
of the natural flavor of the meat is developed and retained. 
The fact should be kept in mind that Flamburg steak must 
be made from fresh, well-ground meat. It is much safer to 
chop the meat at home, as chopped meat spoils very quickly. 
Much depends, too, upon browning it sufficiently to bring 
out the flavors. Many cooks think that Hamburg steak is 
improved if the meat is mixed with milk before it is cooked.

ROAST BEEF 

Use. if possible, a covered roaster for cooking any sort 
of meat. The result is a more tender roast and less shrink- 
age. Wipe the meat, set it in a dripping pan. skin side 
down. Rub with salt and pepper, then dredge with flour. 
Have the oven as hot as possible when meat is put in, so the 
outside will sear cjuickly and prevent the escape of the meat 
juice. As soon as the flour in the pan is brown, reduce 
the heat and baste with the fat in the pan. When the meat 
is half done, turn it on the other side and dredge with flour, 
allowing one hour for each five pounds if the meat is de- 
sired rare. An hour and twenty minutes is needed if you 
wish it well done. 



ROAST BEEF GRAVY 

Pour out most of the fat, leaving 4 tablespoon fuls; set 
the pan on top of the stove, add ^4 cupful flour, and stir it 
with the fat until well browned. Add gradually from 1 to 
2 cupfuls boiling water, and beat the gravy smooth with a 
wire spoon; if it is not rich enough in coloring, brown with 
1/2 teaspoonful kitchen bou([uet. Season with salt and 
pepper.

Cut the pork into thin slices and fry until brown and 
crisp. Take out the pork, putting the vegetables in the fat 
remaining in the pan, and cook slowly fifteen minutes. Rub 
half the pepper and 2 teaspoon fuls salt over the piece of 
meat, and place it in a deep granite ware pan. When the 
vegetables are cooked, put them with the meat, first pressing 
from them as much fat as possible. Into the fat remaining 
in the pan put the flour, and stir until it becomes brown. 
Add the water gradually, stirring all the while. Season 
this gravy with the remainder of the salt and pepper, and 
boil for five minutes ; then pour over the meat in the pan. 
Add the cloves and parsley. Cover the pan and set in a 
very moderate oven. Cook for five hours, basting every 
half hour with the gravy in the pan. The oven must never 
be so hot that the gravy will boil.

Ys tablespoon ful pepper. 

1/2 bay leaf. 

1/3 cupful flour for thickening. 

Wipe meat and cut in one and one half inch pieces, 
sprinkle with a little salt and flour. Put some of the fat in 
a hot frying pan, and when tried out, add meat, turning 
often, till well browned. Then put in a kettle with the 
bones, add boiling water, rinsing out frying pan with some 
of it, that none of the fat will be wasted. Let meat boil for 
five minutes, then set back on the stove where it will cook 
slowly for two hours. Add onion, carrot, and turnip which 
have been cut in half-inch cubes, and cook for another hour. 
Twelve minutes before the stew is done, put dumplings on 
a perforated tin pie plate, or in a steamer, cover closely, and 
do not lift the cover until stew is cooked.

portions removed before chopping. Moisten the meat with 
a very little cold sauce and spread it over the dough. Do 
not use too much. Roll like a jelly-roll ; cut into six pieces, 
and set these on end in a greased baking pan, with a bit of 
butter above each. Bake about twenty-five minutes. Serve 
at once with plenty of brown or cream sauce, according to 
the variety of meat. Corned beef with cream sauce is good. 
Chicken and ham with bechamel sauce (chicken broth and 
rich milk ) is another good combination.

MEAT TURNOVERS 

Almost any kind of chopped meat may be used in these, 
and if the quantity on hand is small may be mixed with 
potato or cooked rice. This fillins;" should l)e seasoned to 
taste with salt and pepper, onion, or whatever is relished, 
and laid on pieces of short biscuit dough rolled thin and cut 
into circles about the size of an ordinary saucer. The 
edges of the dough should be moistened with white of egg, 
the dough then folded over the meat, and its edges pinched 
closely together. If desired, the tops of the turnovers may 
be brushed over with yolk of egg before they are placed in 
the oven. About half an hour's baking in a hot oven is 
required. Serving with a brown sauce increases the flavor 
and moistens the crust. 

BOILED DINNER 

To Boil Corned Beef — Wi[)e the meat and tie securely in 
shape, if this has not been already done at market. Put in 
kettle, cover with cold water, and bring slowly to boiling- 
point. Boil five minutes, remove scum, and cook at a 
lower temperature until tender. Cool slightly in water in 
which it w^as cooked, remove to a dish, cover and place on 
cover a weight, that meat may be well pressed. The lean 
meat and fat may be separated and put in alternate layers 
in a bread pan, then covered and pressed. 

A boiled dinner consists of warm unpressed corned beef, 
served with cabbage, beets, turnips, carrots, and potatoes. 
After removing meat from water, skitu off fat and cook 
vegetables (with exception of beets, which require a long- 
time for cooking) in this water. Carrots re(|uire a longer 
time for cooking than cabbage or turnips. Carrots and tur- 
nips, if small, may be cooked whole; if large, cut in pieces. 
Cabbage and beets are served in separate dishes, other vege- 
tables on same dish with meat.

beef, season and serve on scpares of hot toast. 

TRYING OUT FAT 

A double boiler is the best utensil to use in trying out 
small portions of fat. There is no danger of burning the 
fat and the odor is much less noticeable than if it is heated 
in a dish set directly over the fire. 

CLARIFYING FAT 

Excepting where the purpose of clarifying fat is to re- 
mjove flavors, a good method to follow is to pour boiling 
water over the fat, boil thoroughly, and then to set it away 
to cool. The cold fat may be removed in a solid cake and 
any impurities clinging to it may be scraped off, as they 
will be found at the bottom of the layer. By repeating this 
process two or three times a cake of clean, white fat may be 
obtained. 

A slight burned taste or similar objectionable flavors 
often can be removed from fat by means of potatoes. After 
melting the fat, put into it thick slices of raw potato ; heat 
gradually. When the fat ceases to bubble and the potatoes 
are brown, strain through a cloth placed in a wire strainer.

SELECTION OF POULTRY 
Chicken, turkey, geese, and domestic ducks are classified 
as poultry ; wild duck, wild geese, partridge, reed birds, 
quail, and other small birds, as game. Poultry is a staple 

196 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



article of diet, being more or less available at every season 
of the year. The first broilers come into the market very 
early in the spring, and continue to become more plentiful, 
and to decrease in price during the spring and summer. 
The season for broilers may be said to be at its height in 
May and June. The so-called milk-fed and early spring 
chickens begin to become available in July, and continue in 
the market until August. They are commonly cooked, 
either a la casserole, or roasted. Philadelphia capons begin 
to come in about the same time as roasting chicken, namely, 
in September. They are commonly served at dinner, 
usually roasted. The capon has a somewhat larger and 
plumper carcass than other chicken, and is further dis- 
tinguished by its rich flavor. 

Chicken and other poultry is usually most plentiful before 
Thanksgiving, and the supply of local stock is generally 
exhausted on or before the holidays. After this the city 
markets are supplied chiefly with cold storage stock, and 
hold the local stock at an average level of about one-third 
higher. As the season advances, the tendency is for local 
stock to increase in relative price as the cold storage stocks 
shrink and deteriorate in c|uality. 

The season for turkey is now very similar to that for 
chicken. Not many years ago turkeys were thought to be 
at their best only on or after Thanksgiving Day, but young 
turkeys, comparable to chicken broilers and milk- fed 
chicken, are now commonly cooked and accepted as a sum- 
mer delicacy. Young Guinea hen broilers and roasting 
chickens are also very delicious, being even more tender 
when properly cooked, than chicken, and having a distinc- 
tive flavor that makes them an excellent substitute for 
game birds. The season for domestic ducks is the same 
as that for chicken. 

The c|viality of poultry depends upon the breed, the 
method of feeding, the age of the bird when killed, the 
manner in which the carcass is dressed, and the length of 
time that it has been upon the market. The best chickens 

197 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



have soft, yellow feet, smooth, thick legs, and smooth yel- 
low or white skins. The yellow skinned birds are likely to 
be more plump, those having white skin more tender. The 
skin should be moist and tender, and the breast plump and 
firm. The cartilage of the breast bone should be soft and 
pliable but this cartilage is sometimes broken to deceive pur- 
chasers, a device which, however, if the purchaser is upon 
his guard, can be very easily detected. 

Grain-fed chickens are to be preferred to those fed upon 
table scraps or garbage. Fowls fed upon rice, as is quite 
customary in certain parts of the South, have white fat, 
and the Southern barnyard fed turkey, fattened on small 
rice, is among the finest of domestic fowl. Poultry fed on 
cornmeal have yellow fat. The so-called milk- fed chickens 
are presumed to be fed, or at least fattened, in large parts, 
upon meal, or other ground grain mixed with milk instead 
of water. 

The age of poultry, at the time of killing may usually be 
detected by the legs and feet, which in young birds are 
smooth, moist, and supple, and in older fowl hard and scaly. 
One test is to try the skin under the leg or wing, or to seize 
a pinch of the breast meat and twist it. If the skin and 
flesh is tender and breaks easily, the bird is young and 
fresh. Otherwise, it is probably old, and certainly is tough. 
Also turn the wing backward, if the joint yields readily it 
is tender. The eyes of fresh young fowls are full and 
bright. A growth of hair over the carcass is an indication 
of age in both chicken and turkey. Plentiful pin feathers 
denote a young bird. The flesh of the old turkey, where it 
shows under the skin upon the back and legs, is purplish. 
Observe in this connection that about March turkeys begin 
to deteriorate in quality. Great care should be taken to 
avoid poultry the flesh of which has become tainted and un- 
wholesome. All poultry should be promptly and propeily 
drawn, but the laws of some states permit of fowls being 

198 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



kept for sale undrawn, a condition which is not only a 
serious menace to health, but is ruinous to their proper 
flavor. 

The partly, or otherwise improperly, drawn chicken is 
often as bad (and sometimes even worse ) than the undrawn 
one. The higher price charged in most markets for the 
so-called Philadelphia chicken is a premium paid for proper 
methods of killing and preparing them for market. 

The flavor of poultry is also impaired by scalding, as an 
aid in removing the feathers, hence the dry picked fowl 
sells at a higher price, and is to be preferred, although its 
appearance may be somewhat less attractive. 

A domestic duck or goose should never be more than a 
vear old. Young ducks and geese have white, soft feet and 
tender wings. The body should be plump and thick, the 
fat light and semi-transparent, the breastbone soft, the 
flesh tender. The beak should be flesh-colored and brittle. 
The wind-pipe should break when pressed between the 
thumb and fore-finger. 

Domestic ducks — commonly called in Eastern markets, 
Long Island duckling — and the domestic geese, are, at 
ordinary prices, as economical as chicken. The season is 
the same as for poultry. 

DRESSING POULTRY AND GAME 

Generally fresh killed poultry should not be cooked for 
twenty-four hours, although in hot climates, as, for 
example, in the Southern United States, broiling and roast- 
ing chickens are commonly sold alive, killed by the cook and 
immediately prepared for the oven. Poultry is better if the 
birds are picked dry, but the feathers will come ofi^ more 
easily if the fowl is plunged into a pot of scalding water. 
After the carcass is picked clean it should be held over the 
coals or over a roll of burning white paper or an alcohol 
flame, to singe otT all hairs.

so as to expose the joint, and completely sever the drum- 
stick and second joint in one piece from the carcass. Sep- 
arate the drum-stick from the second joint by cutting from 
the point of the angle between them upon the inside, straight 
in and directly across the joint. 

If the knife is drawn squarely across the joint, it will 
separate without resistance, whereas at any other point the 
knife will encounter solid bone. 

Make an incision along either side of the bone, in the 
second joint, tut under the bone, at the end, lift it up, and 
cut underneath and between the bone and the meat, so as 
to remove the bone from this joint entirely. 

Carve thin slices of the white meat from the breast, 
parallel with the breastbone, and similar slices of the dark 
meat from the face of the second joint, also parallel with 
the bone, and serve to each person a slice of the white and a 
slice of the dark meat, with a few sprigs of cress or parsley, 
a portion of the dressing, and a spoonful of gra\'}' upon 
the side of the plate. 

If the slices from the breast and second joint are suffi- 
cient to serve the entire company, the carver need proceed 
no further ; but if not, the wing should next be cut off, in the 
same manner as the leg, and similarly divided at the joint, 
the second joint of the wing being served as one portion. 
Should the whole turkey be required, the platter should be 
turned and the opposite side carved in the same fashion, 
but the carver should proceed no further than is necessary, 
leaving the remainder of the carcass intact, for another 
meal. 



ROAST STUFFED TURKEY* 

Selection — In, selecting a turkey choose one that is plump, 
with smooth dark legs, and with cartilage at end of the 
breast-bone soft and pliable. Cock turkeys are usually 
considered better than hen turkeys, unless the latter be

small and very plump. When preparing for a large num- 
ber mar!}^ prefer to cook two ten-pound birds rather than 
one large one, as tlie meat is finer grained. 

To dress and clean. — Remove hairs and down by hold- 
ing the bird over a flame ( from gas, alcohol or burning- 
paper ), turning it until all parts have been exposed to tlame. 
This is called singeing. Cut off the head and draw out pin 
feathers using a small pointed knife. Cut through the skin 
around the leg one and one-half inches below the leg joint, 
being careful not to cut tendons. Place leg at this cut over 
edge of board, press downward to snap the bone, take foot 
in right hand, holding turkey firmly in left hand, and pull 
off foot, and with it the tendons. In some birds tendons 
have to be drawn separately, which is done with a steel 
skewer. Poultry drawn at market seldom have the ten- 
dons removed unless ordered. It is an important step, for 
they become hard and bony when cooked. Make an in- 
cision through skin below breastbone, just large enough to 
admit the hand. Remove entrails, gizzard, heart and liver; 
the last three are known as giblets. The gall bladder, lying 
on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver is re- 
moved with the liver; this should not be broken, as the bile 
which it contains imparts a bitter flavor. On either side of 
the backbone may be found the lungs, red and of spongy 
consistency. Care must be taken to remove every part of 
them. The kidneys, lying in the hollow, near the end of 
the backbone, must also be removed. Remove the windpipe 
and the crop by inserting the first two fingers under skin 
close to neck. 

Cut ofi^ neck close to body, leaving skin long enough to 
fasten under the back. Cut ofif tips of wings. Remove 
oil bag and wash bird in cold water. 

To clean giblets — Remove thin membrane, arteries, veins, 
and clotted blood around heart ; separate gall bladder from 
liver, cutting ofif any of liver that may have a greenish 
tinge. Cut fat and membranes from gizzard and cut as 
far as inner lining, being careful not to pierce it. Remove 



203 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



the inner sack and discard. Wash giblets, and cook until 
tender with neck and tips of wings, putting them in cold 
water and heating water quickly. This is used for making 
gravy. 

To stuff poultry — Put stuffing by spoonfuls in neck, 
using enough to fill the skin, so that bird will look plump 
when served. When cracker stuffing is used allowance must 
be made for the swelling of the crackers. Put some of the 
remaining stuffing into body and shape remainder into cakes. 
If the body is full, sew skin; if not filled, fasten with a 
skewer. 

To truss — Draw thighs close to body and hold by in- 
serting a steel skewer under middle joint, running it en- 
tirely through body. Cross drumsticks (legs) tie securely 
with a long soft string and then tie to tail. Place wings 
close to body and hold in place by inserting a second skewer 
through wings and body, and fasten neck skin under back 
with wooden skewer. Turn bird on its breast. Cross 
string attached to tail piece and draw it around each end of 
lower skewer; again cross string; fasten around upper 
skewer ; fasten string in a knot and cut off ends. 

To roast — Dress, clean, stuff, and truss a ten-pound 
turkey as directed. Place on side on rack in dripping pan. 
rub entire surface with salt, and spread breast, legs and 
wings with one-third cupful of butter, rubbed until creamy 
and mixed with one-fourth cupful of flour. Dredge bottom 
of pan with flour. Place in a hot oven, and when flour on 
turkey begins to brown, reduce heat, and baste every fifteen 
minutes until cooked, which will require about three hours. 
For the basting, use one-half cupful of butter melted in one- 
half cupful of boiling water, and after that is used, baste 
with fat in pan. Pour water in pan during the cooking as 
needed, to prevent flour from burning. During the cooking 
turn bird frequently that it may brown evenly. If turkey 
is browning too fast, cover with buttered paper to prevent 
burning. Place on hot platter, remove string and skewers, 

204 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



and garnish with stuffing cakes, celery tips, a string of cran- 
berries and a skewer stuck with three cranberries in breast. 
Decorate legs with paper frills. 

Turkey Stuffing. — Melt one-half cupful of butter substi- 
tute in four cupfuls of scalded milk, and pour over four cup- 
fuls of cracker crumbs, seasoned with salt, pepper, and 
poultry seasoning, then add two eggs, slightly beaten. After 
stuffing the turkey make remaining mixture into cakes, put 
in a slightly buttered pan and bake one hour, basting with 
a small quantity of liquid in pan in which turkey is roasting, 
when basting turkey. The eggs may be omitted if the 
stuffing is not to be served when cold. These cakes make 
an attractive garnish for the turkey, besides forming an 
excellent way to add to the amount of dressing. 

Brown Gravy. — Remove liquid in pan in which turkey 
has been roasted; skim off six tablespoonfuls of fat; re- 
turn fat to pan, place on range, add six tablespoonfuls of 
flour, and stir constantly until well browned; then pour on 
gradually, while stirring, three cupfuls of stock, (in which 
giblets have been cooked). Bring to the boiling point, and 
simmer five minutes. Season With salt and pepper; then 
strain. Add chopped giblets to gravy. 

ROAST CHICKEN 

Choose and clean the chicken as directed for Roast 
Stuffed Turkey. Stuff and bake the chicken until tender 
which will require about 1^ hours. 

CHICKEN PIE 

Cut up chicken and cook in boiling water to cover. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper. When parboiled, remove to a 
deep earthen dish and cover with a crust. Use a recipe for 
rich baking-powder biscuit. Instead of putting a large 
piece of the dough on top of the pie, cut it into rovmds, as 
for biscuit. Cover chicken and gravy with the crust. Bake 

205 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



in a moderate oven until the crust is well risen and brown. 
This is an improvement on the old style of all-over crust, 
because it allows plenty of escape for steam, the biscuit can 
be easily served, and the paste is not made heavy by cut- 
ting with a knife. 

CHICKEN EN CASSEROLE 

1 young- chicken. 

3 tablespoonfuls butter. 

1 small onion. 

1 small carrot. 

1 bay leaf. 

A few mushrooms, canned or fresh. 

2 cupfuls stock or water. 

3 potatoes. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

Clean, singe and cut tlie chicken into pieces convenient 
for serving. Melt the butter in small frying-pan, add the 
onion and carrot, both cut in thin slices, also the pieces of 
chicken, and cook all till golden brown, placing them in the 
casserole as they reach this stage. Pour the stock over 
them, put in the bay leaf, and cover closely. 

When nearly done, add the potatoes sliced, the mush- 
rooms, and seasoning. Cover, and finish the cooking, and 
send to table in the casserole.

2/3 cupful milk. 

Mix and sift dry ingredients, add milk gradually, and 
tgg well beaten. 

Oranges, bananas, prunes, apples, and clams or oysters 
may be used with this batter. 

Fruit — ^Cut fruit in small pieces, roll in powdered sugar, 
mix with the batter before sugar has time to dissolve. 
Fry in deep fat. Roll in powdered sugar just before serv- 
ing. Serve hot. 

For Clams or Oysters — Use 1 tablespoonful of lemon 
juice or vinegar and use liquor of clams or oysters instead 
of water in the batter. 

Tests for Frying Tciiiperatiirc — To prevent absorption 
of fat by foods when fried, the fat must be hot enough to 
form a crust over the food as soon as put in. The fat is 
never hot enough until it ceases to bubble. Then test by 
dropping in an inch cube of bread cut from the middle of a 
slice. 

For cooked mixtures, like croc[uettes or fish and oysters, 
the bread should turn a golden brown in 40 seconds. 

For uncooked mixtures, like fritters and doughnuts, the 
bread should turn a golden brown in 60 seconds. 

Cautions m Frving — 1. Do not let fat get so hot as to 
smoke badly. 

2. Do not fry too large a quantity at one time, for it 
lowers the temperature of the fat. 

3. Drain all fried foods on soft paper to absorb the fat. 

4. Use egg and crumbs to cover mixtures that are likely 
to absorb too much fat.

CHAPTER XIV 

FRUITS* 

In general, it may be said that fruits are wholesome, 
palatable and attractive additions to our diet, and may be 
readily made to furnish a considerable part of the nutrients 
and energy required in the daily fare. Eresh fruits are 
dilute foods, and closely resemble green vegetables in total 
nutritive value, but dried fruits and many preserves, etc., 
are much more concentrated, comparing favorably with 
some of the cereals and other dry vegetable foods in the 
amount of total nutrients and energy which they supply per 
pound. The characteristic constituents of fruits are carbo- 
hydrates, and so they are naturally and properlv used in a 
well-balanced diet to supplement foods richer in protein, 
as cereal grains, legumes, nuts, eggs, dairy products, meats 
and fish. Fruits contain considerable mineral matter, and 
as they are dilute foods they may be added to the diet to 
supply iron and other mineral constituents without unduly 
increasing the supply of protein and energy. Since they are 
bulky and often contain fairly large proportions of indi- 
gestible material, fruits stimulate what might otherwise be 
a sluggish intestine. Intelligently used, fruits are a valu- 
able part of a well-balanced diet, and may well be eaten in 
larger quantities than at present. 

WAYS OF SERVING FRUIT 

In regard to the ways for serving, fruits range from the 
muskmelon and watermelon, almost never cooked, to cran- 
berries and the ordinary variety of quince, w^hich are not 
eaten raw. The methods of preparation are cjuite varied, in- 
cluding drying or evaporating, and baking, boiling and stew- 
ing, while quantities of fruit are used in puddings, pies, and 

*Extract from Farmers' Bulletin No. 293, "Use of Fruit as Food." 

215 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



other dishes, and for the preparation of jams, jelhes, and 
preserves. Fruit juices are used for beverages, and both 
fruits and the juices are very commonly prepared for the 
table bv freezing, fruit ices being considered as among the 
most appetizing desserts. Some fruits, notably the green 
and the ripe olive and less generally the lime, are prepared 
for the table by pickling in brine. 

Even a casual examination of cookery books and the 
periodical literature devoted to such topics shows that the 
wavs in which fruits and fruit products can be cooked and 
served are jiractically endless. 

The temperature fresh fruits are eaten is largely a matter 
of fashion or individual taste. With the increased use of 
ice in our homes during recent years it has become a very 
common custom to serve fruit colder than was formerly the 
case. Cool or even cold fruits are very refreshing", and 
manv prefer them served thus. There are others, however, 
who maintain that overchilling lessens the delicate flavor 
and accentuates the acid taste. They insist that the fruits 
gathered in the cool of the day and stored in a cool but not 
a cold place are at their best. Still others find them sweet- 
est and most palatable when brought from the garden 
warmed by the sun. 

RULES FOR PURCHASE AND CARE 

1. Buy fruit in season; it is cheaper and of better ((uality. 

2. Choose fruit which is not bruised. 

3. Oranges, lemons and grapefruit should be heavy and 

have thin skins. 

4. Small fruits should be spread or their own weight will 

crush them. 

5. Buy small fruits only for immediate use. 

6. Wash all fruits before using. Rinse berries cjuickly 

and drain. 

7. Soak dried fruits in cold water to restore the water 

lost in drving. 

8. Cook over-ripe fruit to make it safe to use.

TO PREPARE CANTALOUPES FOR SERVING 

Cantaloupes should be verv ripe and thoroughly chilled. 
Wipe melons, if small, cut in halves, fill cavity with crushed 
ice; if large, cut in sections. Remove all seeds and stringy 
portion. Serve with salt or powdered sugar. 

TO PREPARE GRAPEFRUIT FOR SERVING 

Wipe grapefruit and cut in halves crosswise. With a 
^har]) knife se])arate the pulp from the skin all around the 
edge, then separate the pulj) from the tough portion which 
divides the fruit in sections. Remove the tough portion in 
(lie piece. Sprinkle the pulp with sugar and let stand a few 
minutes. Serve very cold. 

TO PREPARE ORANGE FOR SERVING 

1. Wipe the orange, cut in halves crossw^ise. Serve on 
fruit plate with orange spoon. 

2. Wipe orange, remove skin and white portion. Separ- 
ate the orange in sections, arrange in a circle on fruit plate 
with a mound of sugar in the center.

^'s teaspoon ful sugar. 

% teaspoon ful clove. 

^ teaspoon ful cinnamon. 

PEAR OR PEACH COCKTAIL 

Peel fruit and cut in eighths; chill, and serve in cocktail 
glasses with sauce poured over it. If canned fruit is used, 
substitute an equal amount of the juice in the can for the 
white grape juice in the sauce recipe. 

217 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



MIXED FRUIT COCKTAIL 

Remove pulp from grapefruit and mix with diced pine- 
apple and sliced banana. Allow 3^ cupful of mixture to 
each serving. Chill thoroughly, add cocktail sauce, also 
chilled, and serve in grapefruit skins or in glasses. (Amer- 
ican Cookery.) 

BAKED APPLES 

Wash and core apples of uniform size. Place in a baking 
pan, fill center of each apple with brown sugar. Add enough 
water to cover bottom of pan. Cinnamon may be sprinkled 
over the apples. Bake in a hot oven until soft. 

APPLE SAUCE 

6 sour apples. 

y2 cupful sugar. 

Yz cupful water. 

Slice of lemon. 

Wash, quarter, core and pare the apples, cut in slices. 
Cook the water, sugar and lemon together five minutes. 
■ Add the apples. Cook until tender, remove lemon and serve 
cold. The sauce may be put through a strainer. 

APPLE PORCUPINE 

Wash, core and pare eight large apples. Make a syrup by 
boiling together for five minutes 2 cupfuls sugar and 2 
cupfuls water. Put the apples in the syrup and cook until 
soft. Use a deep saucepan for cooking so that the apples 
will be covered by the syrup. If on account of the size of 
the saucepan it is necessary to reserve some of the apples 
for a second cooking, place them in cold water to which a 
little vinegar is added to prevent their discoloring. Remove 
apples from syrup, cool, fill centers with orange marmalade 
or some preserved fruit, and stick the apples all over with 
blanched almonds cut in halves lengthwise. Pour the syrup 
around the apples and serve with or without whipped cream. 

To Blanch AUnonds. — Pour boiling water over the nuts 
and let stand two or three minutes. Drain, pour on cold 
water and rub ofi^ the skins. Dry in a paper towel.

CHAPTER XV 

SALADS 

Salads are classified into two groups- — i.e., the raw, such 
as lettuce, endive, radishes, cucumber, celery, etc., and the 
cooked, such as those made from cooked vegetables, eggs, 
cooked cold fish, poultry and meat. Any cold boiled vege- 
tables left over from dinner are useful as giving variety to 
salads, and help to make a good accompaniment to cold 
meat served at luncheon. Thinly sliced cold potatoes, green 
peas and string beans are especially good for this purpose, 
and even Brussels sprouts, carrots and turnips may be used 
on occasion in small quantities. More substantial salads, 
prepared with cold meat or fish, form appetizing luncheon 
dishes. Those made with chicken, lobster and salmon re- 
spectively are most widely known, but cold ham or beef or 
lami) make very good salads, and even the humble herring 
and dried and salted fish may be used to advantage in this 
way. 

There are four essentials to a good salad : everything that 
goes into it must be ice cold, the green vegetable used must 
be perfectly clean and crisp, the ingredients of the dressing 
must be properh' proportioned and thoroughly blended, and 
the salad materials should be well mixed just before the dish 
is served. If these rules are followed a simple head of let- 
tuce with a plain French dressing is a perfect dish. 

For nearlv everv salad lettuce is used as a base, although 
other green plants, such as romaine, chicory and endive, 
may be used. Ha whole head of any green is not rec^uired 
at once, it may be kept fresh for several days. As soon as 
it comes from the market sprinkle it and put it away tightly 
covered in the refrigerator. A good receptacle to keep for 
greens is a five-pound lard pail with a tight lid. When the 
lettuce is required for use. clip ofl: with shears the ragged,

withered ends of the outside leaves, for often the portion 
nearest the stem is good enough to put into the salad. Sep- 
arate the rest of the leaves, wash thoroughly, and leave 
them for fifteen minutes to crisp in ice-cold water, or put in 
a cheese cloth bag in the refrigerator at least one hour 
before serving. 

DRESSINGS FOR SALADS 
FRENCH DRESSING 

1 tablespoon ful vinegar. 

4 tablespoon fuls olive oil. 

34 teaspoon ful salt. 

^ teaspoon ful pepper. 

Put the salt and pepper in the salad bowl, or in a small 
bowl if the sauce is to be served separately. Add a little 
oil and stir well, then gradually add the remainder of the 
oil, stirring all the while. Last of all stir in the vinegar, 
which should be diluted with water if very strong. 

This sauce may be modified to suit different vegetables. 
As it is given, it is right for lettuce, chicory, cooked as- 
paragus, cauliflower, artichoke, etc. Cream may be substi- 
tuted for the oil, but the salad is not so rich. 

CREAM SALAD DRESSING 

1 cupful cream (sweet or sour). 
3/2 cupful tomato catsup. 

2 tablespoon fuls olive oil. 
2 tablespoon fuls vinegar. 
2 tablespoon fuls sugar. 

1 teaspoon ful salt. 

Mix the oil, salt, sugar and vinegar together, then beat in 
the catsup and finally add the cream, beating it in gradually.

ring all the time. Add the vinegar slowly and cook three 
minutes longer. Cool and keep in a cold place in closely

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Have all the ingredients cold. Mix the dry ingredients, 
add the egg yolk, and beat until well mxied. Add the vine- 
gar and lemon juice slowly. Beat with the Dover egg- 
beater and add the oil a teaspoonful at a time. When the 
dressing begins to thicken the oil may be added more rapid- 
Iv. Should the dressing separate, it may be restored to a 
smooth consistency by starting again with one egg yolk and 
adding the mayonnaise slowly to it. 

JMayonnaise may be made by using 3 tablespoonfuls 
lemon juice in place of vinegar and lemon juice; this gives 
a much lighter color. Any olive oil substitute may be used 
in making this dressing. 

Add mayonnaise just before serving the salad, as it soon 
becomes liquid after being added to meat or fish. Whipped 
cream may be added to mayonnaise.

CHAPTER XX 

FROZEN DESSERTS 
GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING 

The amount of ice and salt depends upon the texture of 
the dessert being made. Ice creams, water ices and sher- 
bets should be frozen with three parts of ice to one of salt. 
Frappes, which are coarser in texture, should be frozen 
with equal parts of ice and salt. Mousses and parfaits, 
which are creams frozen without stirring, should be packed 
in ec|ual parts of ice and salt. To pack ice creams, ices and 
sherbets after freezing, use four parts of ice to one of salt, 
and let stand an hour or more to mold. 

Scald the freezer can and fill it only three-quarters full, 
as the cream increases in bulk during freezing. Set the can in 
place, adjust the dasher and handle, and pack in layers with 
ice and salt. The brine should not be drawn off during the 
freezing process unless it is liable to overflow into the can, 
for the brine is the medium which freezes the mixture. 
When the cream is frozen (twenty minutes), draw oft' the 
brine, remove and scrape the dasher, cork the top of the can, 
and re-pack ; then cover with sacking to retain the cold air. 
Let stand to ripen. 

TO PACK AND FREEZE MOUSSES AND PARFAITS 

Dip the mold in cold water, fill with the mixture, cover 
with parafiine paper and adjust the cover, letting the paper 
project. Pack in equal parts of ice and salt ; let stand three 
to four hours to become solid.

VANILLA ICE CREAM 

1 pint milk.

and, when cold, add the vanilla and cream. Freeze and set 
aside to ripen before serving. 

Various additions and flavorings may be added to this 
which may be called a "stock cream" ; for example, two 
scjuares of chocolate melted over hot water may be added 
to the scalded milk before the egg is put in to give chocolate 
cream; or one-half cupful of coffee may be scalded wuth 
the milk and the grounds afterwards removed by straining, 
the egg added and the cream frozen as usual, for coffee ice 
cream. Crystallized cherries or ginger may be cut in small 
pieces and added to the cream when it is half frozen, when 
it will be known by the name of the fruit added.

PASTRY AND PIES 
FLAKY PIE CRUST 

3 cupfiils flour. 

^ cupful butter. 

^ cupful lard. 

Ice water to moisten. 

Vi teaspoon ful salt. 

Sift the flour into a bowl, add the butter and lard, and 
chop with a knife, or rub with a fork, until of the con- 
sistency of coarse meal. Sprinkle the water here and there 
through the flour, and mix with a fork into a stiff dough. 
Drop on a floured board, dust lightly with flour, press down 
with the rolling-pin, and roll back and forth until the paste 
becomes an oblong sheet not more than half an inch in 
thickness. Slip a broad-bladed knife under each end of 
this sheet, and fold over toward the center, thus forming 
three layers of the paste. Life with the knife from the 
board, dust with flour; lay the paste down again, dust with 
flour, roll and again fold over as before. Repeat, and the 
paste is ready to use. Place the paste on ice, or in a cold 
place, for an hour before rolling it out for pies, as its equal- 
ity is improved by so doing; and if the weather is warm it 
may advantageously be placed on ice ten minutes between 
each rolling out. If a teaspoon ful baking powder be sifted 
with the flour, less shortening can be used, but the pastry 
will not be as crisp and delicate. 

PLAIN CRISCO PASTRY 

1>4 cupfuls flour.

knife until finely divided. The finger tips mav be used to 
finish blending the materials. Add gradually sufficient 
water to make a stiff paste. W'ater should be added spar- 
ingly and mixed with the knife through the dry ingredients. 
Form lightly and quickly with the hand into dough ; roll out 
on slightly floured board about one-cjuarter inch thick. Use 
a light motion in handling rolling-pin, and roll from the 
center outward. Sufficient for one small pie.

ingredients together until thoroughly mixed. Turn the 
Mazola into the dry ingredients and cut back and forth with 
a knife till w'ell mixed. Add the water gradually. Xo 
absolute rule for the amount of water can be given. The 
dough should be hard enough not to stick to the bowl, but 
soft enough not to crumble. Toss lightly on to a floured 
beard and roll very thin. 

TWO-CRUST PIES 
APPLE PIE 

Roll pie crust to the thickness desired. Place upon a pie 
pan, shaping it carefully, and cut around the edges with a 
sharp knife. Cover the bottom of the crust with a thin 
layer of sugar, dust with flour, then fill the crust with slices 
of pared and cored apples. Add one-third cupful sugar, 
one-half teaspoon ful cinnamon, and dot over with pieces of 
butter. Roll an upper crust, making an opening in the cen- 
ter for the steam to pass out, and place over the pie. Trim 
around the edges and press the upper and lower crusts to- 
gether. Bake until the apples are soft and the top and 
bottom crusts are nicelv browned.

Scald an earthen bowl, fill with ice water; and wash the

salt is washed out of it. Take out the butter, pat and squeeze 
till all water is removed. Measure from it 2 tablespoon fuls, 
mold the rest into an oblong cake, and set it where it will 
grow hard and cold. Sift 1 pound (4 cupfuls) of flour 

278 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



with Yi teaspoon fill salt into the bowl. Cut in the 2 table- 
spoonfuls butter. Mix with ice water, to a stiff dough. 
Turn out on a marble slab which has been dusted with flour. 
Knead very slightly ; then cover with a bowl, and set away 
to "ripen" five minutes. 

When the dough is ripened put the paste on the slab and, 
rolling lightly with the rolling-pin, shape it about half as 
wide as it is long, keep the corners square. At the center of 
lower half lay the hardened piece of butter. Over this fold 
the upper half of the dough. Tuck lightly around the edges, 
t-nclosing all the air possible, fold right side of paste over 
and left side under the enclosed butter. Turn half way 
round. Rolling lightly with the rolling-pin break up the 
butter, spreading it and rolling the paste into a longer strip. 
Be careful to keep the sides and ends of the paste even, and 
to break as few air bubbles as possible. When the strip is 
long, fold ends toward center, making three layers. Turn 
half way round again, patting, rolling, folding, and turning 
until the process has been repeated six times. If the paste 
is soft, or the butter breaks through, set it away to chill 
before you finish the process. Roll always in one direction, 
from 3'ou, with a long motion. After the seventh rolling 
fold the ends toward the center, making four layers; chill. 
During the winter puff paste, wrapped and covered, may be 
kept for several weeks in a very cold place. Use it as de- 
.^ired, baking patties, vol au vents, or tarts as required. 
These will keep five or six days after making, being reheated 
before they are filled. 

The oven for baking puff paste should be hot, with the 
greatest heat underneath, so the paste can rise to its full 
height before browning. As heat touches the pastry, the 
bubbles expand, lifting the thin layers higher and higher. 
When it has reached its height, and is baked delicately 
brown, you have what is properly called puff paste. 

When using a cutter, always dip in flour between each 
cutting ; it will insure neat edges. 

279 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Rich pastry never makes a good iindercrust — it soaks. 

When baking small pieces such as pattie tops or cheese 
straws, do not put them in a pan with the larger pieces ; 
they bake in less than half the time required by the others. 

If you wish pastry to have a glazed appearance, brush 
over with beaten egg before putting it in the oven. 

Utilize trimmings for smaller things ; never add them to 
the larger pieces of paste. 

Use the sharpest knife for cutting pastry; if it is dragged 
ever so slightly in the cutting it will not rise well as it breaks 
the layers. Also, in making two layers of pastry adhere, 
never press it together or you will have a heavy spot. 

Always have puff ice cold when it is put in the oven. Let 
the heat be greatest at the bottom when the paste is put in ; 
it nuist rise before it begins to brown. 

VOL AU VENTS 

Lay a mold upon a round of puft' paste, rolled about half 
an inch thick, and cut out a circle as big as you think will be 
required to cover it. Set the mold upside down and tuck 
down the paste, handling carefully. Do not cover scantily 
anywhere or it will crack. Prick all over with a fork and 
set away in a cold place to chill thoroughly. Find a plate or 
saucer which fits the top of the mold and cover with puff 
paste. Cut from the trimmings stars, hearts, crescents, or 
any forms you can produce with a paste j agger. Brush the 
paste on the saucer lightly with cold water, and stick on the 
ornaments in any style desired. Chill the vol au vent and 
lid for half an hour, then bake in an oven which is very hot 
at first, but cooled slightly wdien the pastry has risen and is 
beginning to brown. Watch the baking with great care, as 
the paste will burn or become unshapely if not turned occa- 
sionally. A vol au vent may be filled with any creamed 
mixture or with a cooked, chilled fruit and rich syrup. 

280 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



PATTIES 

Roll out the paste half an inch thick ; shape two rounds 
with a cutter. From one round cut a smaller piece. Use 
the ring left to lay on the other round, brushing with water 
to make it stick. Bake and fill with a creamed mixture, 
using the small round as a lid. 

CHEESE STRAWS 

Season some grated cheese with paprika and salt, then 
dust it over a piece of puff paste. Fold the paste and roll 
two or three times. Cut out in straws. The straws may be 
braided or baked singly.

CHAPTER XXn 

CAKE 

Cakes are divided into two classes : Cakes without but- 
ter; examples sponge cake, angel food, sunshine cake. 
Cakes with butter ; examples, cup and pound cakes. 

Use accurate measures. 

Utensils for Mixing — Use a deep, earthen mixing-bowl 
and a slotted wooden spoon. 

Do not grease pans for cakes without butter. Use a new 
pan which has never been greased and if kept for cakes of 
this class greasing will not be necessary. 

Pans for Butter Cakes — Grease pans thoroughly for but- 
ter cakes, sift a little flour in the pan after it is greased. See 
that the corners of the pan are well greased. Fill the pans 
only two-thirds full of the cake mixture. For fruit cake 
which requires long baking line the pan with greased paper. 

General Method for Cakes without Butter — Separate the 
yolks and whites of eggs. Beat the yolks until lemon-col- 
ored and thick, add the sifted sugar slowly while beating. 
Add the flavoring, then fold in the whites beaten stiff and 
dry. Sift the flour several times with the baking powder, 
cut and fold it into the mixture until all is well blended. 

Sponge cakes and others of the class are raised mainly by 
air and steam and, containing many eggs, need a moderate 
oven. 

Baking. — Oven test for sponge cake : Turns white paper 
yellow in five minutes. 

Method of Mixing Cakes ivith Butter — Measure ingredi- 
ents, dry first and then the liquids and butter. Cream the 
butter; then add the sugar and cream together until the 
sugar is dissolved and the mixture is creamy. Beat tgg 
yolks with a Dover beater. Beat the whites with an tgg 

283 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



whip. Add beaten yolks to creamed mixture. Sift the 
flour and measure it, being careful not to pack it down in 
the cup. Sift it again with the baking powder or soda, salt 
and spices if used. Then add liquid alternately with sifted 
flour, to keep the mixture about the same consistency. Add 
the flavoring and beat thoroughly. Add the whites beaten 
stiff at the last, by cutting and folding in very carefully. 
Do not stir the mixture after the egg whites are in. 

Oven Test for Butter Cakes — White paper turns light 
brown in 5 minutes. Butter cakes rec|uire a hotter oven 
than those without butter. If the oven gets too hot, place a 
cover of paper over the cake or set a pan of cold water in 
the oven. Cake is baked when it shrinks away from the 
sides of the pan and springs back in place when touched 
lightly with the finger.

CHAPTER XXV 

CONFECTIONS 

Candy is a useful food when eaten at the proper time, at 
the close of a meal. Homemade cand}' is cheaper and purer 
than that bought in many stores. 

EFFECTS OF HEAT ON SUGAR 

Sugar undergoes several changes during the process of 
cooking. The terms "soft ball," "hard ball," "thread," 
"the crack," or "brittle" and "caramel" are used in mak- 
ing candy to distinguish the different temperatures and 
changes. 

1. "Soft ball" is the stage of heating sugar when a 
little dropped into cold water and then rolled in the fingers 
forms a soft ball. 

2. "Hard ball" is the stage when sugar similarly tested 
makes a hard ball in the fingers. 

3. "Thread" is a higher temperature stage when the 
sugar spins a thread when dropped from a spoon. 

4. The "crack" or "brittle" stage is reached when the 
sugar immediately hardens and crackles when dropped into 
cold water. 

5. "Caramel" is the stage at which the heat causes the 
sugar to turn brown. 

Utensils for candy-making are: 1. A large agate or 
iron kettle, as sugar burns very easily. 2. A wooden spoon 
or paddle for mixing. 3. Buttered tins or a marble slab 
for cooling.

CHOICE CARAMELS 

1 pound sugar (2 cupfuls). 

^ cupful Karo. 

34 pound butter (l^ cupful). 

1 pint cream (2 cupfuls). 

Put the sugar, Karo, butter and half of the cream over 
the fire and stir until the mass boils thoroughly. Then stir 
in gradually, so as not to stop the boiling, the second cup- 
ful of cream. Put the sugar thermometer in, let the mix- 
ture boil, stirring every three or four minutes, until the 
thermometer registers 250° F. Then stir in a teaspoonful 
of vanilla, and turn into two brick shaped bread pans, nicely 
buttered, or onto an oiled marble between steel bars, to 
make a sheet v)4-inch thick. When nearly cold cut in cubes. 
Roll them at once in waxed paper or let stand 24 hours to 
dry ofif. Without a thermometer boil the mass to a pretty 
firm hard ball. No better caramels can be made. In sum- 
mer the caramels will hold their shape better if boiled from 
2 to 4 degrees higher. 

MAPLE KISSES 

2 cupfuls maple sugar. 
}i cu])ful water. 

2 tablespoonfuls butter. 

1 cupful shelled pecan nuts. 

Cook the water, sugar and butter till a little dropped in 
cold w^ater forms a firm ball ; add the nuts, stir till the mix- 
ture begins to cool and thicken, and then drop, in small 
spoonfuls, on a greased paper or plate. 

COCOANUT KISSES 

2 cupfuls sugar. 
1 cupful milk. 

M cupful cocoanut. 
1 teaspoonful vanilla. 
Speck of salt.

Boil the sugar, milk and salt to the soft ball stage. Re- 
move from the fire, set the saucepan in a dish of cold water 
and leave until thick. Remove from the water, beat, add 
the cocoanut and vanilla. When creamy pour into a buttered 
pan and mark in squares or drop by spoonfuls on greased 
paper. 

DIVINITY FUDGE 

2 cupfuls brown sugar. 

1/2 cupful water. 

1 teaspoon fnl vanilla extract. 

3/ cupful chopped nuts. 

1 egg white. 

Boil the sugar and water together till a little dropped in 
cold water forms a soft ball. Pour the hot mixture over 
the stiffly-beaten white of the tgg, beating while pouring. 
Add nuts and extract and beat vigorously till the candy 
stiffens. When nearly set drop by spoonfuls on paper. 
When cold the candy will harden so that it can be easily 
taken from the paper. 

SYRUP NOUGATINES 

Boil 11/2 cupfuls light corn syrup and ^ cupful water 
to 246 deerrees F., or until it forms a firm ball when tried 
in cold water. Pour slowly onto the well-beaten white of 
an egg, beating constantly with a wire whisk. Place the 
bowl over water kept just below the boiling point and fold 
and turn 3 or 4 minutes. Remove from fire, add V2 tea- 
spoonful of vanilla or other flavoring and continue folding 
until the mixture is nearly cool. Add 1 cupful chopped 
salted peanuts or a mixture of any desired candied fruits 
and nuts. Spread ^ inch thick on wax paper, cover with 
wax paper and cut in squares.

TUTTI FRUTTI BALLS 

1 cupful puffed rice or corn, 1 cupful seedless raisins, 
I cupful stoned dates, 1 cupful figs, 1/4 cupful chopped 
nut meats. 1 tablespoon ful chopped angelica or citron, ^ 
cupful chopped candied orange peel, and 2 teaspoonfuls 
vanilla extract. Put the rice, fruits, orange peel and nut 
meats through a food chopper, stir well adding the extract. 
Make into small balls and allow to dry. Roll in shredded 
cocoanut. 

CANDIED APPLE OR FRUIT 

One i)ound apples (which do not cook readily). Peel 
and cut into the size desired. Place in 1 cupful of syrup 
and boil slow!}' until the apple becomes transparent. Take 
the apple out one piece at a time and drain on a fork. Let 
stand on wax paper 3 to 4 hours, roll in finely chopped 
cocoanut. Other fruits : pineapple, pears and quinces may 
be used in place of apples. Syrups which ha\'e given good 
results with the above fruits : Sorghum honey, sorghum 
and glucose (half and half), corn, maple, cane. Fruit is 
improved if allowed to stand in the syrup overnight before 
draining. 

STUFFED DATES 

Use the best dates, wash and remove the stones, fill with 
peanuts, walnuts, hickory nuts or any nuts available. Peanut 
butter makes a good filling that is different. Press dates 
in shape and roll in chopped nuts, cocoanut or a mixture of 
cocoa and powdered cinnamon. 

STUFFED PRUNES 

Steam 1 pound of prunes and remove the stones. 
Stuff' part of the prunes, each with another prune, stuff 
others with chopped salted nuts, or stuff with a mixture of 
1 cupful each of raisins and walnuts and a few candied 
cherries. Another suggestion is to stuff prunes with stiff 
orange marmalade.

CHOCOLATE DAINTIES OR BITTER SWEETS 

Alelt bitter sweet chocolate in double boiler, remove from 
the fire and beat until cool. In this dip nuts or sweet fruits 
and place on oiled paper. 

GLACE NUTS 

2 cupfuls granulated sugar. 

1/8 teaspoon ful cream of tartar. 

2-3 cupful boiling water. 

Boil the sugar, water and cream of tartar together till 
a little dropped in cold water is brittle and clear. Do not 
stir while cooking. If the sugar becomes too hard, add a 
tablespoon of water and cook and test again. Dip the 
prepared nuts in the hot syrup, one at a time, using a candy 
dipper or sugar tongs, being careful not to shake or stir 
the syrup, place on paper or plate to harden. 

GLACE FRUITS 

The same mixture is used for fruits. Cut Malaga grapes 
from the bunch, leaving a short stem on each. Divide an 
orange into sections, use Maraschino cherries. See that 
the fruit is free from moisture, dip in the syrup and place 
on paraffin paper. 

FONDANT No. 1 

5 cups (2>2 lbs.) sugar. 

214 cupfuls of water. 

yi teaspoon ful cream of tartar. 

Place all in a saucepan and stir till dissolved. Boil with- 
out stirring to the soft ball stage (IHi/o C. or 238 F. if 
soft fondant is desired or 116 2-3 C. or 242 F. for harder 
fondant). To prevent crystallization, either boil for the 
first ten minutes with the cover on, or from time to time 
wash down the sides of the pan with a swab of cloth wet 
in hot water. Pour on an oiled platter and cool till it can 

317

be handled. Beat with a knife or wooden spoon till creamy; 
then gather into the hands and knead till soft and velvety. 
Keep in a jar at least 24 hours before using. Or proceed 
as before but cool in a platter to 90 F., 32 C, and beat till 
creamy and pour into a jar. When wanted for use, melt in 
a double boiler over hot water. 

FONDANT No. 2 

4 cupfuls granulated sugar. 

j4 teaspoonful cream of tartar, or 

3 drops of vinegar. 

11/4 cupfuls cold water. 

Stir the sugar and water in a saucepan, place at the back 
of the range until the sugar is melted, then draw the sauce- 
pan to a hotter part of the range ,and stir until the boiling 
point is reached; add the cream of tartar or vinegar and 
with a cloth wet in cold water, wash down the sides of the 
saucepan, to remove any grains of sugar that have been 
thrown there. Cover the saucepan and let boil rapidly three 
or four minutes. Remove the cover, set in the thermometer 
if one is to be used — and let cook very rapidly to 240 F. 
or the soft ball stage. Dampen a marble slab or a large 
platter, then without jarring the syrup turn it onto the 
marble or platter. Do not scrape out the saucepan or allow 
the last of the syrup to drip from it, as any sugary portions 
will spoil the fondant by making it grainy. When the 
syrup is cold, with a spatula or a wooden spoon, turn the 
edges of the mass towards the center, and continue turning 
the edges in until the mass begins to thicken and grow 
white, then work it up into a ball, scraping all the sugar 
from the marble into the mass. 

Knead it slightly, then cover closely with a hea\'y piece 
of cotton cloth wrung out of cold water. Let the sugar 
stand for an hour or longer to ripen, then remove the damp 
cloth and cut the mass into pieces ; press these closely into 
a bowl, cover with a cloth wrung out of water (this cloth

must not touch the fondant) and then with heavy paper. 
The fondant may be used the next day, but it is in better 
condition after several days, and may be kept ahnost in- 
definitely, if the cloth covering it be wrung out of cold 
water and replaced once in 5 or 6 days. Fondant may be 
used, white or delicately colored with vegetable coloring 
pastes, or as frosting for small cakes, or eclairs, or for 
making candy " centers," to be coated with chocolate or 
with some of the same fondant tinted and flavored appro- 
priately. 

CANDIES MADE FROM FONDANT 
CREAM MINTS 

Alelt fondant over hot water, flavor with a few drops 
of oil of peppermint, wintergreen, clove, cinnamon, or 
orange and color if desired. Drop from a spoon on oiled 
paper. 

BONBON FONDANT 

Let fondant stand twenty- four hours or more in an 
earthenware bowl covered with several thicknesses of wet 
cloth. To dip bonbons heat the fondant by setting it in a 
pan of hot water over the stove and stirring constantly. A 
double boiler may be used for this purpose. Dip the centers 
by transfixing them with a fork and set them to cool on 
sheets of waxed paper. This recipe is suitable for all sorts 
of nuts, fruits, and other centers. The fondant may be 
colored as desired. 

CREAM CANDIES 

CHOCOLATE CREAMS 

Mold fondant into cone-shaped balls with the hands or 
fingers. Let them stand overnight on waxed paper or a 
marble slab, or until they are thoroughly hardened. If they 
are allowed to stand twenty- four hours or more all the 
better.

COATING FOR CHOCOLATE CREAMS 

Melt a cake of chocolate in a double boiler. When melted 
add a lump of paraffin as big as a small walnut, half as 
much l)utter. and a few drops of vanilla. 

TO COAT CHOCOLATE CREAMS 

Place the pan of melted chocolate in a larger pan of 
boiling water. This keeps the chocolate melted. Place the 
creams on waxed paper at the left, and a sheet of waxed 
paper to receive the coated chocolates at the right. Take 
up the creams by thrusting them through with a two-tined 
fork, dip them quickly in the chocolate, and slip them ofif on

FIRELESS COOKER

CHAPTER XXVI 

THE FIRELESS COOKER* 
INTRODUCTION 

The principle employed in the fireless cooker has long 
been known and may be briefly stated as follows : If a hot 
body is protected by a suitable covering the heat in it will 
be retained for a long time instead of being dissipated by 
radiation or conduction. In using a fireless cooker the 
food is first heated on the stove until the cooking has be- 
gun and then it is placed in the fireless cooker, a tight re- 
ceptacle in which the food is completely surrounded by 
some insulating substance, which prevents the rapid escape 
of the heat so that it is retained in the food in suf^cient 
Cjuantity to complete the cooking. Sometimes an addi- 
tional source of heat, such as a hot soapstone or brick, is 
put into the cooker with the food where a higher cooking 
temperature is desired. 

One of the chief advantages of the fireless cooker is that 
it accomplishes a saving in fuel, especially where gas, kero- 
sene, or electric stoves are used. Where coal or wood is 
the fuel, the fire in the range is often kept up most of the 
day and the saving of fuel is less. In summer or when 
the kitchen fire is not needed for heating purposes, the din- 
ner can be started on the stove early in the morning and 
then placed in the fireless cooker, the fire in the range be- 
ing allowed to go out. During hot weather the use of a 
kerosene or other liquid-fuel stove and a fireless cooker is a 
great convenience, since it not only accomplishes a saving 
in fuel but helps to keep the kitchen cooler. As would 
be expected, the saving in fuel resulting from the use of a 
fireless cooker is greatest in the preparation of foods like 
stews, which reciuire long and slow cooking.

Department of Agriculture.

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



The great convenience of the fireless cooker is that it 
saves time, for foods cooked in it do not require watching 
and may be left to themselves while the cook is occupied 
with other duties, or the family is away from home, with- 
out danger from fires or overcooking the food. Its use, 
therefore, may enable a family to have home cooking in- 
stead of boarding, or hot meals instead of cold foods. 
Another advantage of the use of the fireless cooker is that 
it makes it easier to utilize cheaper cuts of meat, which, 
although not having as fine a texture or flavor, are fully as 
nutritious, pound for pound, as the more expensive cuts. 
Long cooking at relatively low temperature, such as is given 
foods in the fireless cooker, improves the texture and flavor 
of these tougher cuts of meat. 

HOW TO MAKE A HOMEMADE FIRELESS COOKER 

While there are many good fireless cookers .on the 
market, it is possible to construct a homemade cooker 
which, if properly built, will give very satisfactory results 
and is cheaper than one which is purchased. The mate- 
rials needed are a box or some other outside container, 
some good insulating or packing material, a kettle for hold- 
ing the food, a container for the kettle or a lining for the 
nest in which the kettle is to be placed, and a cushion or 
pad of insulating material to cover the top of the kettle. 

For the outside container a tightly built wooden box, is 
probably the most satisfactory. A small barrel, or a 
large butter or lard firkin or tin may be used. An- 
other possibility is a galvanized-iron bucket with a closelv 
fitting cover; this latter has the advantage of being fire- 
proof. A box, 15 by 15 by 28 inches, is convenient in size, 
since it may be divided into two compartments. The box 
should have a hinged cover, and at the front side a hook 
and staple or some other device to hold the cover down; 
an ordinary clamp window fastener answers the latter pur- 
pose very well. Whatever the container used, its size, 
which depends upon the size of the kettle used, should be 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



large enough to allow for at least 4 inches of packing 
material all around the nest in which the kettle is placed. 

The kettles used for cooking should be durable and free 
from seams or crevices, which are hard to clean. They 
should have perpendicular sides and the covers should be 
as flat as possible and provided with a deep rim shutting 
well down into the kettle to retain the steam. It is 
possible to buy kettles made especially for use in fire- 
less cookers; these are provided with covers which can be 
clamped on tightly. The size of the kettle should be de- 
termined by the quantity of food to be cooked. Small 
amounts of food can not be cooked satisfactorily in large 
kettles, and it is therefore an advantage to have a cooker 
with compartments of two or more different sizes. Kettles 
holding about 6 quarts are of convenient size for general 
use. Tinned iron kettles should not be used in a fireless 
cooker, for, although cheap, they are very apt to rust from 
the confined moisture. Enameled ware kettles are satisfac- 
tory, especially if the covers are of the same material. 
Aluminum vessels may be purchased in shapes which make 
them especially well adapted for use in fireless cookers and, 
like enameled ware, they do not rust. 

Fireless cookers are adapted to a much wider range of 
cooking if they are provided with an extra source of heat, 
since a higher cooking temperature may thus be obtained 
than if hot water is depended upon as the sole source of 
heat. Obviously this introduces a possible danger from 
fire in case the hot stone or other substance should come 
into direct contact with inflammable packing material like 
excelsior or paper. To avoid this danger a metal lining 
must be provided for the nest in which the cooking vessel 
and stone are to be put. As an extra source of heat a 
piece of soapstone, brick, or an iron plate, such as a stove 
lid, may be used. This is heated and placed in the nest un- 
der the cooking vessel ; sometimes an additional stone is 
put over the cooking vessel. 

324 



■ 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



The container for the cooking vessel, or the Hning for 
the nest in which it is to be put, should be cylindrical in 
shape; should be deep enough to hold the cooking kettle 
and stone, if one is used; and should fit as snugly as pos- 
sible to the cooking vessel, but at the same time should allow 
the latter to be moved in and out freely. If the cylinder is 
too large the air space between it and the kettle will tend 
to cool the food. For this purpose a galvanized iron or 
other metal bucket may be used or, better still, a tinsmith 
can make a lining of galvanized iron or zinc which can be 
provided with a rim to cover the packing material. In 
case no hot stone or plate is to be used in the cooker, the 
hning can be made of strong cardboard. 

For the packing and insulating material a variety of sub- 
stances may be used. Asbestos and mineral wool are un- 
doubtedly the best, and have the additional advantage that 
they do not burn. Ground cork (such as is used in pack- 
ing Malaga grapes), hay, excelsior, Spanish moss, wool, 
and crumpled paper may also be used satisfactorily. Of 
the inexpensive materials that can be obtained easily, 
crumpled paper is probably the most satisfactory, since it 
is clean anrl odorless and, if properly packed, will hold the 
heat better than some of the others. To pack the con- 
tainer with paper, crush single sheets of newspaper be- 
tween the hands. Pack a layer at least 4 inches deep over 
the bottom of the outside container, tramping it in or pound- 
ing it in with a heavy stick of wood. Stand the container 
for the cooking vessel, or the lining for the nest, in the 
center of this layer and pack more crushed papers about it 
as solidly as possible. If other packing, such as excelsior, 
hay. or cork dust, is used, it should be packed in a similar 
way. Where an extra source of heat is to be used, it is 
much safer to pack the fireless cooker with some non- 
inflammable material, such as asbestos or mineral wool. 
If a fireproof packing material is not used a heavy pad of 
asbestos paper should be put at the bottom of the metal nest 

325 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



and a sheet or two of asbestos paper should be placed be- 
tween the lining of the nest and the packing material. What- 
ever packing material is used, it should come to the top of 
the container for the kettle, and the box should lack about 4 
inches of being full. A cushion or pad must be provided to 
fill completely the space between the top of the packing and 
the cover of the box after the hot kettles are put in place. 
This should be made of some heavy goods, such as denim, 
and stuffed with cotton, crumpled paper, or excelsior. 

HOW TO USE THE FIRELESS COOKER 

Obviously the fireless cooker must be used with intelli- 
gence to obtain the best results. It is best suited to those 
foods which require boiling, steaming, or long, slow cook- 
ing in a moist heat. Foods can not be fried in it, pies can 
not be baked successfully in the ordinary fireless cooker, nor 
can any cooking be done which requires a high, dry heat 
for browning. Meats, however, may be partially roasted 
in the oven and finished in the cooker, or may be begun in 
the cooker and finished in the oven with much the same re- 
sults as if they were roasted in the oven entirely. The 
classes of food best adapted to the cooker are cereals, soups, 
meats, vegetables, dried fruits, steamed breads, and pud- 
;]ings. 

When different foods are cooked together in the fireless 
cooker they must be such as require the same amount of 
cooking, since the cooker can not be opened to take out food 
without allowing the escape of a large amount of heat and 
making it necessary to reheat the contents. It would not 
do to put foods wdiich need aljout one and one-half hours 
to cook into the cooker with a piece of meat which would 
stay several hours. 

Thie size of the container used in cooking with the fireless 
cooker should be governed according to the amount of food 
to be cooked. Small quantities of food can not be cooked 
satisfactorily in a large kettle in the fireless cooker. If a 
large kettle must be used better results will be obtained if 

326 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



some other material which holds heat fairly well is used to 
fill up the empty space. This may be accomplished in sev- 
eral ways. One is to put the small quantity of food to be 
cooked into a smaller, tightly closed kettle, fill the large 
kettle with boiling water and put the small kettle into it, 
standing it on an inverted bowl or some other suitable sup- 
port. This boiling water will take up and hold the heat 
better than air w^ould. Several smaller dishes (if tightly 
covered) may be placed in the kettle surrounded by boiling 
water. Baking-powder or other tins often are found use- 
ful for this [jurpose. Another way is to place one food in 
a basin which just fits into the top of a large kettle and to 
let some other material, some vegetable perhaps, cook in the 
water in the bottom of the kettle. Two or more flat, shal- 
low kettles placed one on top of the other so as to fill the 
cooker enables one to cook small amounts of different foods 
successfully. Such kettles, made especially for use in fire- 
less cookers, may be purchased. 

The time which each kind of food should stay in the 
cooker depends both on the nature of the food and on 
the temperature at which it remains inside the cooker, and 
before recipes for use with the fireless cooker can be pre- 
pared one must have some means of knowing how tem- 
peratures are preserved in it. In experiments made in this 
ofiice a 6-quart kettle was filled with boiling water and put 
into the cooker, the packing of which happened to be news- 
paper. The temperature of the water, which was 212° F. 
when put into the cooker, was found to be 172° F. after 
four hours had elapsed and 155° F. after eight hours had 
elapsed. This shows the advisability of the common cus- 
tom of allowing food to remain undisturbed in the cooker 
for at least six or eight hours, or in some cases overnight. 
If a soapstone, hot brick, or other extra source of heat is 
used, less time will be required. Materials which are denser 
than water ( sugar sirup as used in cooking dried fruit), and 
therefore can be heated to a higher degree, will keep up the 
temperature longer when put into the cooker. Thus the

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



density of the food material, as well as the amount and the 
length of time that the apparatus retains the heat, must be 
taken into consideration in determining how long different 
materials must be cooked in the cooker. 

The recipes for dishes to be prepared in the fireless cooker 
differ somewhat from those for foods cooked in tlie ordin- 
ary way, chiefly in the amount of water or other liquids 
called for. Less licpiid should be put into the food to be 
prepared in an ordinary fireless cooker, since there is no 
chance for water to evaporate. The cook must be guided 
largely by experience in deciding how long the food should 
be heated before being put into the cooker and how long 
it should be allowed to remain there. Fortunately there are 
several good fireless cookbooks on the market whose direc- 
tions can be relied upon. 

RECIPES FOR USE WITH THE FIRELESS COOKER 

The following recipes, prepared by Miss Ola Powell and 
Miss Alary E. Creswell, have been used in extension work 
in the Southern States.. 

CREOLE CHICKEN 

1 medium-sized chicken. 
6 tomatoes or 1 No. 2 can tomatoes. 
3 sweet red peppers cut into small cubes. 
3 sweet green peppers cut into small cubes or 1 No. 2 
can of peppers. 

y^, pound ham or 2 or 3 slices bacon chopped finely. 
1 bay leaf. 

1 tablespoon chopped parsley. 

2 teaspoons salt. 

1 onion (size of egg). 

2 taljlespoons butter or bacon drippings. 

Cut chicken as for stew ; sear by dropping it into 1 pint 
boiling water, then let simmer gently for one-half hour. 

329 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Cook the chopped onion in the butter or meat drippings 
until Hght yellow. Simmer tomatoes for 15 minutes with 
the bay leaf, strain, and pour over the onions. Now add 
the minced ham and parsley and cook for 1 5 minutes longer. 
To this mixture add the chopped peppers and the chicken 
stock and bring to a boil. Put the chicken into the fire- 
less-cooker vessel, pour over it this mixture of vegetables 
and let boil 5 minutes. Put at once into the fireless cooker. 
With the hot soapstone, let the chicken stay in the cooker 
for 2 hours; without hot stone, for 3 hours. 

A ham bone may be substituted for the ham or bacon. 
If this is done, boil it for one-half hour in enough water 
to cover. Then add 1 cup of the ham broth to the tomato 
before cooking it with the bay leaf. This recipe gives a 
good way to use chicken too old to fry or broil. A similar 
dish can be made by using a c[uart of canning club soup 
mixture. \Mien necessary, thicken the broth with a little 
browned flour before putting the chicken into the cooker. 

CEREALS 

Hominy Grits. — Five cups water, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 cup 
hominy grits. Pick o\er and wash hominy grits. Have 
the salted water boiling and add the hominy slowly, so as 
not to stop the boiling. Continue to boil rapidly for 10 
minutes over the fire, then put the vessel into the cooker 
as cjuickly as possible and allow to remain (overnight) for 
about 12 hours. The vessel of hominy mav be placed in 
another vessel of boiling water before being placed in the 
cooker. 

Samp {coarse hominy). — One-half cup samp soaked in 
1 cup cold water 6 hours. Add 1^ teaspoons salt and 3 
cups boiling water. Boil rapidly 45 minutes. Put into 
cooker for 8 to 12 hours. 

Oatmeal. — Three cups water, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 cup oat- 
meal. Carefully look over the oatmeal and remove any 
husks of foreign substance. Add gradually to the boiling,

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



salted water and boil rapidly for 10 minutes, stirring con- 
stantly. Now it may be put into the cooker. After 2 or 3 
hours it is soft, but a better flavor will be developed by 
longer cooking. It may remain in the cooker over-night in 
the same manner the hominy grits are cooked (about 12 
hours ) . Next morning it may have to be reheated. To do 
this, set the cooker pan in a pan of water over the fire. 
When the water boils up well, the oatmeal may be served. 

Plain Rice. — One cup rice, 3 cups water, ly^ teaspoons 
salt. Look over and wash the rice through several waters, 
until cloudiness is removed. Bring the salted water to a 
boil. One-half teaspoon lard may be added. Then add 
rice gradually to the boiling water in the cooker vessel so 
as not to stop the boiling. The grains should be kept mov- 
ing in the boiling water and allow to boil 5 minutes before 
putting it into the cooker for 45 minutes or an hour. 

There is a considerable difTerence in rice. Old rice ab- 
sorbs more water than new rice and the time for cooking 
it will vary. An hour will be sufficient usually for this 
small amount. Rice is injvired by overcooking. When 
rice is tender, drain in colander and place in warm oven 
for about 5 minutes. Serve at once. Sometimes it is well 
after draining rice in colander to pour cold water over it. 
This will wash away the starchy substance between the 
grains, and keep them from adhering or sticking together. 
Then place the colander in a hot oven to heat and dry out the 
rice. If desired the lard may be omitted. It lends a bril- 
liancy to the rice grains when cooked. 

Rice in Pilaf (an oriental mixture). — Two cups stock, 1 
cup rice, 2 tablespoons butter, 1 teaspoon sugar, 2 slices 
onion, 6 ripe tomatoes or 1 cup canned tomato juice, 1 tea- 
spoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, 1 tablespoon chopped green 
sweet pepper may be added. 

Look over and wash the rice. Chop the onion very finely 
and fry in 1 tablespoon of the butter until yellow. Add to 
it the boiling juice of the tomatoes and the boiling broth 
and allow all to boil before adding the rice gradually so 

331 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



as not to stop the boiling. Boil mixture about 5 minutes 
and place in cooker 1 hour. When ready to serve, add 1 
tablespoon butter. Stir with a fork to mix evenly. Pilaf 
is injured by overcooking. 

SOUPS : 

W^gctablc Soup (made without stock). — One-half cup 
carrots, ^ cup turnips, 1 cup potatoes, ]/> cup onions, ^ 
cup cabbage, 3 cups tomato juice or 1 No. 3 can tomatoes, 
1 tablespoon flour, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 tablespoon celery seed 
(crushed), 1 quart water, 4 tablespoons butter, ^A table- 
spoon parsley, Yx 'teaspoon pepper. 

Cut all vegetables (except potatoes and onions and pars- 
ley) into small pieces. Cook them for 10 minutes in 3 
tablespoons butter. Add potatoes and cook 3 minutes 
longer. Mix all ingredients (except parsley) in the cooker 
utensil and boil 5 minutes. Alix 1 tablespoon butter and 
1 tablespoon flour; add enough of the licjuor to make it 
smooth and pour it into the mixture. Cook 5 minutes 
more and put into the cooker for 4 to 6 hours. 

Creole Soup (made with stock). — Stock: Two pounds 
shin beef (meat and bone). Ij/^ quarts water. Cut the 
meat from the bone into small pieces. Crack the bone and 
soak 1 hour in cold water. Bring to a boil slowly and when 
boiling place in the cooker for 5 to 7 hours. When cooked, 
strain and set away to cool. The cake of fat which forms 
on top when stock is cold seals the stock and keeps out air 
and germs and should not be removed until soup is to be 
made. Then fat is removed and stock heated and any sea- 
sonings or additions desired are put in. 

To 1 quart of this stock or 1 quart water in which chicken 
has been cooked, add 1 quart of canned soup mixture and 2 
tablespoons rice or barley, bring to a boil and cook in 
cooker 2 to 3 hours. This will make a delightful soup. 

Meat and Vegetable Combinations. — With the less tender 
cuts of beef and mutton which require long, slow cooking,

delicious dishes may be prepared by adding vegetables and 
cooking in the fireless cooker. 

Cut the meat into cubes, dredge with flour, and brown 
it in meat drippings or lard and butter. Then brown the 
onions in the same fat. For every 3 or 4 cups of meat 
use one of the following vegetable combinations or 1 quart 
of canning club soup mixture. Put into the fireless cooker 
vessel and add 1 cup boiling water with the first combina- 
tion or 2 cups water with the second one. Boil for 5 min- 
utes and put into cooker for 3 or 4 hours 

First 

2 cups okra. 

2 cups tomatoes. 

2 onions. 

lyi teaspoons salt. 

1/8 teaspoon pepper. 

Second 

2 cups potatoes. 

1 cup turnips. 

1 cup carrots. 

2 onions. 

3/2 cup celery or 1 tablespoon celery seed, crushed. 
The following recipes, prepared by Mrs. K. C. Davis and 
Miss Angeline Wood, have been used in demonstrations in 
connection with the extension work in the Northern and 
Western States : 

CEREAL BREAKFAST FOODS 

Cereal breakfast foods should be prepared at night while 
the fire for supper is hot. Measure the required quantity 
of boiling water into the cooker kettle ; add salt and cereal ; 
let boil 10 minutes and place in box overnight. Reheating 
in the morning will probably be necessary. In winter enough 
for two or three breakfasts may be cooked at once and re- 
heated as wanted. The food in the inner kettle should be 
cooked about five minutes before placing in the outer 
kettle. Then the whole should stand over the flame until 

333 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



the water boils in the outer kettle. Any other kind of 
breakfast cereal may be cooked by adopting these general 
directions. 

The raw cereal breakfast foods, such as plain oatmeal, 
hominy, cracked wheat, etc., cost less than those which are 
partly cooked by steam at the factory, but frequently house- 
keepers prefer not to use them because they require so many 
hours of cooking. A cooking box, however, is especially 
well adapted for cooking just this sort of material. Even 
the cereal preparations which are partly cooked at the fac- 
tory and are supposed to need only a few minutes cooking 
to make them ready for the table are much improved by 
long, slow cooking such as they get in the cooking box. 
The flavor and texture of cereal breakfast foods are in- 
fluenced by the length of time they are cooked, and with 
the cooking box it is easily possible to secure the texture 
and flavor dependent upon long slow cooking. 

SOUPS 

The cheap cuts of meats are rich in the food materials 
that make palatable dishes, and the bones and scraps are 
good for making wholesome soup. If care is taken to use 
material which might otherwise be wasted, the real expense 
for most meat soups is in the long cooking required. The 
long-continued, slow cooking which a tough piece of meat 
obtains in the cooking box and the thorough extraction to 
which bones and soup meat are subjected mean that the 
cooking box makes stews, ragouts, and similar dishes and 
soups cheap foods for the table. American families do 
not, as a rule, use as much soup as do foreigners, and thus 
they miss a useful and pleasant addition to the daily bill 
of fare, and one which may be served without much extra 
work or expense, if rightly prepared. 

For making soup stock or broth with the cooking box. 
the soup bones should be well split up, or the soup meat 
should be cut into small pieces. Wash the meat, place it 
in the kettle, and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil 

334 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



on the stove and boil 15 minutes. Do this at night if the 
soup is to be used at noon the next day. Place in the 
cooker overnight. In the morning remove meat and bones 
from soup. Strain and remove fat. Return soup and 
meat to kettle, adding whatever seasoning is desired. Bring 
to a boiling point again and return it to the box and let 
remain until noon. This stock may be used as a founda- 
tion for several soups, such as vegetable soup, clear soup, 
or noodle soup. 

Beef soup may be ^•aried almost indehnitely by the differ- 
ent seasonings which may be added. There is scarcely a 
vegetable grown which is not good in beef soup. In win-ter 
many of the dried vegetables, such as beans, peas, lentils, 
etc.. are excellent for this purpose. 

Dried Lima beans, peas, and lentils make excellent soup 
without meat. Since they require long-continued cooking, 
they are well adapted to fireless-cooker methods. These 
dried vegetables, cooked with less water and no meat, 
rubbed through a coarse sieve and made into the proper 
consistency with milk or thin cream, and seasoned to taste, 
make so-called "cream" soups. Soups made by thinning 
the cooked legumes with water and seasoning with onion 
(fried until pale brown), with celery tops, and other vege- 
tables are very palatable also. 

MEATS 

Some cuts of meats which are not so readily prepared for 
the table by the usual methods are especially palatable if 
cooked in the cooking box. The experimenter will soon 
learn that in cooking meats the amount of boiling over the 
flame and the time in the box will depend upon the size of 
the pieces of meat being cooked. Meat cut into pieces for 
stew will heat through more readily and cook in a shorter 
time than will a large ham, for example. Most recipes for 
stews, pot roasts, boiled meats, and similar dishes can be 
readily adapted to the fireless cooker and save time and 

335 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



fuel. The following recipes are all well adapted to the 
cooking box, as all of them are dishes which require con- 
siderable time for their preparation by the usual methods. 

Pot roast. — Use any preferred cut. Sear in hot fat in a 
skillet. Place the meat in the cooker kettle with boiling water 
Boil gently for 30 minutes (20 minutes will suffice if the 
roast is 3 pounds or less). Place in the cooker over night 
Reheat in the morning, season, and return to the cooking 
box until noon. Thicken some of the liquor for gravy. If 
it is desired to slice cold for next dinner, return meat to 
liquor and let stand until wanted. 

Brozvn fricassee of chieken. — Joint the chicken and 
brown in fat after rolling in flour. As pieces brown pack 
them in the kettle. When all are browned make gravy in 
the skillet where the browning was done. Add this to the 
chicken with enough boiling water to cover. Salt and pep- 
per. Boil 20 minutes. Place in box over night. Reheat 
and return to box until noon. This length of time in the 
box will reduce the toughest old fowl on the farm to a state 
where the meat will fall from the bones. 

Roast meat. — Prepare a 4-pound rib roast as for oven 
roasting. It can be tied more compactly if the ribs are re- 
moved. Place in pan in very hot oven for half an hour, or 
sear the roast until brown in a frying pan and then place it 
in the oven for 20 minutes. Have ready a small pail into 
which the roast will fit as closely as possible. Place the 
seared and heated roast in this and set it into the large kettle 
used in the box, with enough boiling water to come well up 
around the small pail. Place in the box for three hours. 

Roasting tough poultry. — Many housewives make a prac- 
tice of stewing chicken or turkey which they think is likely 
to be tough, and the practice is a good one. It is, however, 
much easier to boil for 15 or 20 minutes and then put the 
fowl, boiling hot, into the cooker and let it remain 10 hours. 
It should then be drained, wiped dry, and stuffed, if stuffing 
is desired, and roasted long enough to brown it well. 

336 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Boiled dinner. — Cook a piece of corned beef and a piece 
of salt pork in the cooker overnight. In the morning pre- 
pare all the vegetables it is desired to use and place in the 
kettle with meat. The greater the variety the better the 
dinner. Boil 10 or 15 minutes and return to the cooker. 
It is best to leave potatoes until an hour and a cjuarter before 
serving, as they are the only vegetables likely to suffer from 
too long a time in the cooker. When they are added bring 
the contents of the kettle to the boiling point again. The 
liquid from the boiled dinner makes a good soup if the 
corned beef and salt pork have been parboiled to remove 
some of the salt. 

FRESH VEGETABLES 

Carrots, peas, string beans, onions, beets, turnips, pars- 
nips, salsify, and in fact all vegetables may be cooked in the 
cooking" box. They must be given time according to their 
age. A safe rule for all green vegetables is two and a half 
times as long in the cooker as if boiled on the stove. This 
method is particularly good for such vegetables as onions, 
cabbage, and cauliflower, as there is no escape of odor from 
the cooker. A further adxantage with cabbage, cauliflower, 
and other green \egetables is that overcooking is avoided. 
When green vegetables are cooked too long in boiling water 
they turn yellow and lose their fine flavor. This they do 
not do so readily at the same temperature of the cooking 
box. 

Boston beans and other dried vegetables. — In cooking dry 
beans, the time required either in the oven or the cooking 
box will vary with the length of time the beans have been 
kept ; the older the beans the more cooking required. Soak 
1 quart of beans overnight ; in the morning drain them and 
cover with cold water and heat to boiling. Let boil until 
the skins will burst when touched very lightly, adding one- 
fourth teaspoon of soda a few minutes before taking from 
the fire. Drain through a colander. Return to the kettle 

337 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



and add 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of mustard, 3 table- 
spoonfuls molasses, and one-half pound of salt pork, washed 
and scraped, and cover with boiling water. Let boil 20 or 
30 minutes, then place in the cooking box. If the beans are 
new, six hours in the box will be long enough. Old beans 
require longer cooking and should be left in the box over- 
night, then reheated in the morning, and returned to the 
box. They will be ready to serve for the midday meal. 

Dried vegetables, such as peas, beans, Lima beans, lentils, 
or corn may be soaked in cold water several hours, and then 
after the preliminary boiling of a few minutes kept from 6 
to 12 hours in the cooker. They may be cooked with salt 
pork, and thus prepared they are liked by many, or they may 
be cooked with vegetable oil, as olive oil, or they may be 
cooked plain and seasoned with salt, pepper, and butter or 
cream. The longer, then, dry vegetables are cooked in the 
box the more palatable and the more digestible they will be. 

DRIED FRUITS 

Li the case of dried fruits as well as dried vegetables long- 
continued slow cooking is desirable. A common method is 
as follows: Wash the fruit well and let it soak in cold 
water until it has regained its natural size, and then place on 
the back of the range and allow it to remain there for 20 
minutes, but do not allow it to boil. When fruit is cooked in 
the cooking box, it should be washed and soaked in the way 
described, heated in the water in which it has been soaked, 
not quite to the boiling point, and then placed in the cooker 
for five or six hours. Because less water evaporates than 
when cooking on the stove, a smaller proportion of water 
will be needed for good results. If too much is used the 
sirup will not be quite so rich as usual. Fruit should always 
be cooked in an enamelware or an earthenware dish, as tin 
or iron may impart an unpleasant flavor to acid fruit, and 
also give it an undesirable color. 

338 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



PUDDINGS AND STEAMED BREADS 

Steamed or boiled puddings, or such as require long, slow 
cooking, and steamed bread, like Boston brown bread, are 
the kinds best adapted to the cooking box. Every family 
has its favorite recipes and these may be used, as the method 
of procedure is the same for cooking all such foods. 

The steamed or boiled puddings or breads should be 
placed in molds well buttered. For this purpose pound bak- 
ing powder cans are excellent. Coffee cans or other tin 
boxes of suitable size with covers will do. After filling 
about two-thirds full to allow for the expansion or rising of 
the batter or dough, the cans are placed in the cooker kettle 
and should have the covers put on before the boiling begins. 
If any covers are missing, paper may be tied tightly over the 
tops. If there are not enough cans to fill the kettle so that 
they will not tip over when the boiling water is poured 
around them, an empty can or two may be wedged in, to 
hold the others in place. Fill the kettle as full as possible 
with boiling water, as the more water the longer the heat 
will be retained. Place the kettle on the stove and boil for a 
full half hour and then keep the kettle and contents in the 
cooking box three to six hours, or longer if the cans are 
large ones. This applies particularly to breads or puddings 
made with wheat flour. If they contain cornmeal or 
graham flour they should be cooked for a longer time in the 
cooker. 

On removing from the cooker it is a good plan to set the 
loaves of bread in a hot oven for 10 minutes to dry them a 
little.

PRESERVATION CANNING OF VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 

National War Garden ConWmission Bulletin. 

CANNING OF VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 

The preservation of foodstuffs by Canning is alway? 
effective Food Thrift. It enables the individual household 
to take advantage of summer's low prices for vegetables, 
even if no garden has been planted. It effects the saving 
of a surplus of foodstuffs that would otherwise be wasted 
through excess of supply over immediate consumption. It 
eliminates the cold storage cost that must be added to the 
prices of commodities bought during the winter. Of vital 
importance, also, is that it relieves the strain on transpor- 
tation facilities of the country. All this increases the need 
for Home Canning and proves that this is a national 
obligation. 

CANNING MADE EASY BY MODERN METHODS 

By the Single Period Cold-Pack method it is as easy to 
can vegetables as to can fruits and it is more useful. By 
the use of this method canning may be done in the kitchen 
or out of doors. It may be done in the individual house- 
hold or by groups of families. Community canning is 
important in that it makes possible the use of the best 
equipment at small individual outlay and induces Food 
Conservation on a large scale. 

342 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



COMMUNITY WORK 

One of the best methods to follow in canning and dry- 
ing operations is for several families to club together for 
the work. The work may be carried on at a schoolhouse, 
in a vacant storeroom, at the home of one of the members 
or at some other convenient and central location where 
heat and water can be made available. By joining in the 
purchase of equipment each participant will be in position 
to save money as against individual purchases and at the 
same time have the advantage of larger and more com- 
plete equipment. The cost is slight when thus divided and 
the benefits very great to all concerned. 



STERILIZATION OF FOOD 

The scientist has proven that food decay is caused by 
microorganisms, classed as bacteria, yeasts and molds. 
Success in canning necessitates the destruction of these 
organisms. A temperature of 160° to 190° F. will kill 
yeasts and molds. Bacteria are destroyed at a temperature 
of 212° F. held for the proper length of time. The destruc- 
tion of these organisms by heat is called sterilization. 



METHODS OF CANNING 

There are five principal methods of home canning. 
These are : 

1. Single Period Cold-Pack Method. 

2. Fractional or Intermittent Sterilization Method. 

3. Open Kettle or Hot-Pack Method. 

4. Cold Water Method. 

Of these methods the one recommended for home use is 
the Single Period Cold-Pack Method. It is much the best 

343 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



because of its simplicity and effectiveness and detailed in- 
structions are given for its use. The outlines of the 
various methods are as follows : — 

1. Single Period Cold-Pack Method: The prepared 
vegetables or fruits are blanched in boiling water or live 
steam, then quickly cold-dipped and packed at once into 
hot jars and sterilized in boiling water or by steam pres- 
sure. The jars are then sealed, tested for leaks and 
stored. Full details of this method are given on the 

pages following. 

2. Fractional or Intermittent Sterilization Method : 
Vegetables are half sealed in jars and sterilized for one 
hour or more on each of three successive days. This 
method is expensive as to time, labor and fuel and discour- 
ages the home canning of vegetables. 

3. Open Kettle or Hot-Pack ?^lethod: Vegetables or 
fruits are cooked in an open kettle and packed in jars. 
There is always danger of spores and bacteria being intro- 
duced on spoons or other utensils while the jars are being 
filled. 

"The fruit is cooked in syrup until tender, then packed 
in sterilized jars. The jars should be filled to overflow- 
ing, the hot rubber adjusted and the tops fastened on^at 
once. 

To sterilize : Place clean jars and tops on a rack in a 
kettle of cold water, being sure that jars are completely 
covered by the water. Place the kettle over the fire, bring 
the water to the boiling point and boil 10 minutes. Dip 
the rubbers into boiling water. Do not remove jars from 
the water until you are ready to use them." 

This method should never be used in canning vegetables. 
Even with fruits it is not as desirable as the cold-pack. 

4. Cold-water Method : Rhubarb, cranberries, goose- 
berries, and sour cherries, because of their acidity, are 
often canned by this method. The fruits are washed, put 

344 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



in sterilized jars, cold water is added to overflowing, and 
the jar is then sealed. This method is not always success- 
fnl as the acid content varies with the ripeness and the 
locality in which the fruits are grown. 

ADVANTAGES OF THE SINGLE PERIOD COLD-PACK 
METHOD 

The Single Period Cold-Pack Method is a simple and 
sure way of canning. It insures a good color, texture and 
flavor to the vegetable or fruit canned. In using this 
method sterilization is completed in a single period, saving 
time, fuel and labor. The simplicity of the method com- 
mends it. Fruits are put up in syrups. Vegetables require 
onlv salt for flavoring and water to fill the container. 

Another advantage is that it is practicable to put up food 
in small as well as large quantities. The housewife w^ho 
understands the process will find that it pays to put up 
even a single container. Thus, wdien she has a small sur- 
plus of some garden crop she should take the time neces- 
sarv to place this food in a container and store it for 
future use. This is true household efficiency. 

SINGLE PERIOD COLD-PACK EQUIPMENT 

The Home-made Outfit : A serviceable Single Period 
Cold-pack canning outfit may be made of equipment found 
in almost anv household. Any utensil large and deep 
enough to allow an inch of water above jars, and having 
a closelv fitting cover, may be used for sterilizing. A 
wash-boiler, large lard can or new- garbage pail serves the 
purpose when canning is to be done in large quantities. 
Into this utensil should be placed a wire or wooden rack 
to hold the jars off the bottom and to permit circulation 
of w^ater underneath the jars. For lifting glass top jars 
use two buttonhooks or similar device. For lifting screw- 
top jars, suitable lifters may be bought for a small sum. 

345 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



A milk carrier makes a good false bottom, and if this is 
used the jars may be easily lifted out at the end of the 
sterilization period. 

COMMERCIAL HOT-WATER BATH OUTFITS 

These are especially desirable if one has considerable 
cjuantities of vegetables or fruits to put up. They are 
convenient for out-door work, having firebox and smoke 
pipe all in one piece with the sterilizing" vat. As with the 
home-made outfit, containers are immersed in boiling 
water. 

Water Seal Outfits. — These are desirable, as the period 
of sterilization is shorter than in the home-made outfit 
and less fuel is therefore required. The outfit consists of 
two containers, one fitting within the other, and a cover 
which extends into the space between the outer and the 
inner container. The water jacket makes it possible for 
the temperature in the inner container to be raised above 
212° . 

Steam Pressure Outfits. — Canning is very rapid when 
sterilization is done in steam maintained at a pressure. 
There are several canners of this type. Each is provided 
with pressure gauge and safety valve and they carry from 
5 to 30 pounds of steam pressure. This type is suitable 
for home or community canning. 

Aluminum Pressure Outfits. — These cookers are satis- 
factory for canning and for general cooking. Each outfit 
is provided with a steam pressure gauge and safety valve. 

CONTAINERS. 

For home use glass jars are more satisfactory for can- 
ning than tin. Tin cans are used chiefly for canning on 
a large scale for commercial purposes. Glass jars prop- 
erly cared for will last for years. All types of jars which 
seal readily may be used. Jars having glass tops held in 
place by bails are especially easy to handle while they are 
hot.

that is claimed for it by the manufacturer.

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Tops for Economy jars must be purchased new each 
year. 

Containers made of white glass should be used if the 
product is to be offered for sale or exhibition, as blue glass 
detracts from the appearance of the contents. 

Small-necked bottles can be used for holding fruit 
juices. Large-mouthed bottles can be used for jams, mar- 
malades and jellies. 

TESTS FOR JARS AND RUBBERS 

Jars should be tested before they are used. Some of 
the important tests are here given : 

Glass-top Jars. — Fit top to jar. If top rocks when 
tapped it should not be used on that jar. The top ball 
should not be too tight nor too loose. If either too tight 
or too loose the ball should be taken off and bent until it 
goes into place with a light snap. All sharp edges on top 
and jar should be filed or scraped off. 

Scrczv-top Jars. — Use only enameled, lacc[uered or vul- 
canized tops. Screw the top on tightly without the rub- 
ber. If thumb nail can be inserted between top and jar, 
the top is defective. If the edge is only slightly uneven it 
can l)e bent so that it is usable. Put on the rubber and 
screw on the top tightly, and then pull the rubber out. If 
the rubber returns to place the top does not fit properly and 
should not be used on that jar. 

Rubbers. — Be very particular aljout the rubbers used. 
Buy new rubbers every year, as they deteriorate from one 
season to another. It is always well to test rubbers when 
buying. A good rubber will return to its original size 
when stretched. When pinched it does not crease. It 
should fit the neck of the jar snugly and be fairly wide 
and thick. It is cheaper to discard a doubtful rubber than 
to lose a jar of canned goods. 

348 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



GRADLNG 

Vegetables and fruits should be sorted according to 
color, size and ripeness. This is called grading. It in- 
sures the best pack and uniformity of flavor and texture 
to the canned product, which is always desirable. 

BLANCHING AND COLD-DIPPING 

The most important steps in canning are the preliminary 
steps of blanching, cold-dipping, packing in hot, clean con- 
tainers, adding hot water at once, then immediately half 
sealing jars and putting into the sterilizer. Spoilage of 
products is nearly always due to carelessness in one of 
these steps. Blanching is necessary with all vegetables 
and many fruits. It insures thorough cleansing and re- 
moves objectionable odors and flavors and excess acids. 
It reduces the bulk of greens and causes shrinkage of fruits, 
increasing the cjuantity which may be packed in a con- 
tainer, which saves storage space. 

Blanching consists of plunging the vegetables or fruits 
into boiling water for a short time. For doing this place 
them in a wire basket, or a piece of cheesecloth. The 
blanching time varies from one to fifteen minutes, as 
shown in the time-table. 

Spinach and other greens should not be blanched in hot 
water. They must be blanched in steam. To do this place 
them in a colander and set this into a vessel which has a 
tightly-fitting cover. In this vessel there should be an inch 
or two of water, but the water must not be allowed to 
touch the greens. Another method is to suspend the 
greens in the closed vessel above an inch or two of water. 
This may be done in a wire basket or cheesecloth. Allow 
the water to boil in the closed vessel from fifteen to twenty 
minutes. 

When the blanching is complete remove the vegetables 
or fruits from the boiling water or steam and plunge them 
once or twice into cold water. Do not allow them to stand

in the cold water. This latter process is the Cold Dip. It 
hardens the pulp and sets the coloring matter in the 
product. 

ESSENTIALS FOR CANNING 

It is important to plan your work so that whatever may 
be needed will be ready for use. Arrange everything con- 
veniently in advance. Preliminary provisions include : 

1. A reliable alarm clock in a convenient place (set to 
ring when the sterilizing is done ) . 

2. All the necessary equipment in place before begin- 
ning work. 

3. Jars, tops and rubbers carefully tested. 

4. Fresh, sound fruits and vegetables. 

5. Reliable instructions carefully followed. 

6. Absolute cleanliness. 

7. If working alone, prepare only enough vegetables 
or fruits to fill the number of jars that the sterilizer will 
hold. Always blanch and cold-dip only enough product 
to fill one or two jars at a time. As soon as the jar is 
filled and the rubber and top bail adjusted the jar must be 
put into the hot- water bath. 

8. In using the hot-water bath outfit, count the time of 
sterilization from the time water begins to boil. The 
water in the sterilizer should be at or just below the boiling 
point when jars are put in. \\'ith the W^ater Seal Outfit 
begin counting time when the thermometer reaches 214° F. 
W\th the Steam Pressure Outfit begin counting time when 
the gauge reaches the number of pounds called for in 
directions. 

STEPS IN THE SINGLE PERIOD COLD-PACK METHOD 

In canning by the Single Period Cold-Pack Method it 
is important that careful attention be given to each detail. 

351 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Do not undertake canning until you have familiarized 
yourself with the various steps, which are as follows : 

1. Vegetables should be canned as soon as possible 
after being picked ; the same day is best. F^arly morning is 
the best time for gathering them. Fruits should be as 
fresh as possible. 

2. Before starting work have on the stove the boiler 
or other holder in which tbe sterilizing is to be done, a 
pan of boiling water for use in blanching and a kettle of 
boihng water for use in filling jars of vegetables; or, if 
canning fruits, the syrup to be used in filling the jars. 
Arrange on the working table all necessary equipment, in- 
cluding instructions. 

3. Test jars and tops. All jars, rubbers and tops 
should be clean and hot. 

4. Wash and grade product, according to size and ripe- 
ness. (Cauliflower should be soaked 1 hour in salted 
water, to remove insects if any are present. Put berries 
into a colander and wash, by allowing cold water to flow 
over them, to prevent bruising.) 

5. Prepare vegetable or fruit. Remove all but an inch 
of the tops from beets, parsnips and carrots and the strings 
from green beans. Pare scpiash, remove seeds and cut in 
small pieces. Large vegetables should be cut into pieces 
to make close pack possible. The pits should be removed 
from cherries, peaches and apricots. 

6. Blanch in boiling water or steam as directed. 

7. Cold-dip, but do not allow product. to stand in cold 
water at this or any other stage. 

8. Pack in hot jars which rest on hot cloths or stand 
in a pan of hot water. Fill the jars to within ^ inch of 
tops. (In canning berries, to insure a close pack, put a 
2 or 3 inch layer of berries on the bottom of the jar and 
press down gently with a wooden spoon. Continue in this 
manner with other lavers until jar is filled. Fruits cut in 
half should be arranged with pit surface down. 

352 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



9. Add salt and boiling water to vegetables to cover 
them. To fruits add hot syrup or water. 

10. Place wet rubber and top on jar. 

11. With bail-top jar adjust top bail only, leaving 
lower bail or snap free. With screw top jar screw the top 
on lightly, using only the thumb and little linger. (This 
partial sealing makes it possible for steam generated within 
the jar to escape, and prevents breakage.) 

12. Place the jars on rack in boiler or other sterilizer. 
If the home-made or commercial hot water bath outfit is 
used enough water should be in the boiler to come at least 
one inch above the tops of the jars, and the water, in 
boiling out, should never be allowed to drop to the level of 
these tops. In using the hot-water bath outfit, begin to 
count sterilizing time when the water begins to boil. Water 
is at the boiling point "when it is jumping or rolling all 
over. \\'ater is not bailing when bubbles merely form on 
the bottom or when they begin to rise to the top. The 
water must be kept boiling all during the period of steril- 
ization. 

13. Consult time-table and at the end of the recjuired 
sterilizing period remove the jars from the sterilizer. 
Place them on a wooden rack or on several thicknesses of 
cloth to prevent breakage. Complete the sealing of jars.. 
\\'ith bail-top jars this is done by pushing the snap down, 
with screw top jars, by screwing cover on tightly. 

14. Turn the jars upside down as a test for leakage 
and leave them in this position till cold. Let them cool 
rapidlv, but be sure that no draft reaches them, as a draft 
will cause breakage. (If there is any doubt that a bail-top 
jar is perfectly sealed a simple test may be made by loosen- 
ing the top bail and lifting the jar by taking hold of the 
top wath the fingers. The internal suction should hold the 
top tightly in place when thus lifted. If the top comes off 
put on a. new wet rubber and sterilize 15 minutes longer for 
vegetables and 5 minutes longer for fruits.) With screw- 
top jars try the tops while the jars are cooling, or as soon 

353 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



as they have cooled, and. if loose, tighten them by screwing 
on more closely. 

15. Wash and dry each jar, label and store. If storage 
place is exposed to light, wrap each jar in paper, preferably 
brown, as light will fade the color of products canned in 
glass. The boxes in which jars were bought affords a good 
storage place. 

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CANNING VEGETABLES

THE CANNING OF FRUITS 

For fruits, as well as for vegetables, the Single Period 
Cold-Pack Method is best. With some exceptions, as 
shown in the table, fruits should be blanched before can- 
ning. Wdien fruits are intended for table use. syrup should 
be poured over them to hll the jars. In canning fruits to 
be used for pie-filling or in coijking, where unsweetened 
fruits are desirable, boiling water is used instead of syrup. 
When boiling water is thus used the sterilization period in 
h"i-water bath is thirty minutes. 

SYRUPS 

In the directions given various grades of syrup are men- 
tioned. These syrups are made as follows : 

Thin — 1 part sugar to 4 parts water. 

Medium — 1 part sugar to 2 parts water. 

Thick — 1 part sugar to 1 part water. 

Boil the sugar and water until all the sugar is dissolved. 
Use thin syrup with sweet fruits. Use medium syrup with 
sour fruits. Thick syrup is used in candving and preserv- 
ing. 

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CANNING FRUITS 
APPLES 

Wash, pare, quarter or slice and drop into weak salt 
water. Blanch 1 1< minutes, cold-dip. pack into jar and 
cover with water or thin syrup. Put on rubber and top and 
adjust top bail. Sterilize for 20 minutes in hot-water bath. 

With Steam Pressure Outfit sterilize 8 minutes at 5 to 
10 pounds pressure. 

Apples shrink during sterilization and for this reason 
economy of space is obtained by canning them in the form 
of sauce instead of in quarters or slices. In canning sauce 
fill the jars with the hot sauce and sterilize 12 minutes in 
hot-water bath.

CHAPTER XX\Tn 

PRINCIPLES OF JELLY MAKING* 

To be satisfactory, jelly must l)e made from fruit juice 
containing pectin and acid. Pectin is a substance in the 
fruit which is soluble in hot water and which, when cooked 
with sugar and acid, gives, after cooling, the right con- 
sistency to jelly. 

Fruits to be used should be sound, just ripe or slightly 
under-ripe, and gathered but a short time. Wash them, 
remove stems and cut large fruits into pieces. With juicy 
fruits add just enough water to prevent burning while 
cooking. In vising fruits which are not juicy cover them 
with water. Cook slowly until the fruits are soft. Strain 
through a bag made of flannel or two thicknesses of cheese- 
cloth or similar material. 

TEST FOR PECTIN 

To determine if the juice contains pectin, boil 1 table- 
spoonful and cool. To this add 1 tablespoonful of grain 
alcohol and mix, gently rotating the glass. Allow the mix- 
ture to cool. Ha solid mass — which is pectin — collects, 
this indicates that in making jellv one part of sugar should 
be used to one part of juice. If the pectin collects in two 
or three masses, use 2/3 to -v-j as much sugar as juice. If 
it collects in several small particles use ^4 as much sugar 
as juice. If the presence of pectin is not shown as de- 
scribed it should be supplied by the addition of the juice 
of slightlv under-ripe fruits, such as apples, currants, crab- 
apples, green grapes, green gooseberries or wild cherries.

Measure the juice and sugar. The sugar may be spread 
on a platter and heated. Do not let it scorch. When the 
juice begins to boil add the sugar. Boil rapidly. The jelly 
point is reached when the juice drops as one mass from 
the side of a spoon or when two drops run together and 
fall as one from the side of the spoon. Skim the juice, 
pour into sterilized glasses and cool as quickly as possible. 
Currant and green grape require 8 to 10 minutes boiling 
to reach the jelly point, while all other juices require from 
20 to 30 minutes. 

When the jelly is cold pour over the surface a layer of 
hot paraffin. A toothpick run around the edge while the 
pariffin is still hot will give a better seal. Protect the 
paraffin with a cover of metal or paper. 

Three or more extractions of juice may be made from 
fruit. When the first extraction is well drained cover the 
pulp with water and let it simmer 30 minutes. Drain, and 
test juice for pectin. For the third extraction proceed in 
the same manner. The juice resulting from the second and 
third extractions may be combined. If the third extraction 
shows much pectin a fourth extraction may be made. The 
first pectin test should be saved for comparison with the 
others. 

If the second, third or fourth extraction of juice is 
found thinner than the first extraction, boil it until it is 
as thick as the first ; then add the sugar called for. 

JELLY MAKING WITHOUT TEST 

The test for pectin is desirable, but is not essential. In 
some states it is inconvenient because of the difficulty of 
obtaining grain alcohol. A large percentage of house- 
wives make jelly without this test, and satisfactory results 
mav be obtained without it if care is taken to follow direc- 
tions and to use the right fruits. For the inexperienced 
jellv-maker the safe rule is to confine jelly-making to the 
fruits which are ideal for the purpose. These include cur- 
rants, sour apples, crab-apples, under-ripe grapes, ciuinces, 

367 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, wild cherries and green 
gooseberries. These contain pectin and acid in sufficient 
quantities. 

In making jelly without the alcohol test, with the juice 
of currants and under-ripe grapes use 1 cup of cugar to 1 
cup of juice. With raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, 
sour apples, crab-apples, quinces, wild cherries and green 
gooseberries use }i cup of sugar to 1 cup of juice. This 
applies to the first extraction of juice and to the later ex- 
tractions when they have been boiled to the consistency of 
the first extraction. 

Fruits which contain pectin but lack sufficient acid are 
peach, pear, quince, sweet apple and guava. With these 
acid may be added liy the use of juice of crab-apples or 
under-ripe grapes. 

Strawberries and cherries have acidity but lack pectin. 
The pectin may be supplied by the addition of the juice of 
crab-apples or under-ripe grapes. 

DIRECTIONS FOR JELLY MAKING 

Wash, remove stems, and with the larger fruits cut into 
quarters. Put into a saucepan and cover with water. Al- 
low^ to simmer until the fruit is tender. Put into a bag to 
drain. H desired, test juice for pectin as described. Meas- 
ure juice and sugar in proportions indicated by the test for 
pectin or as directed under "Jelly Making Without Test." 
Add the sugar w'hen the juice begins to boil. The sugar 
may be heated before being added. When the boiling juice 
reaches the jellv point skim and pour into sterilized glasses. 

TO PREPARE GLASSES FOR JELLY 

Wash glasses and put them on a rack or folded cloth 
in a kettle of cold water. Heat the water gradually to the 
boiling point and let boil ten minutes. Remove glasses, 
drain and place in a pan containing a little hot water, while 
filling; or place them on a cloth wrung out of hot water.

lo Cover Jelly Glasses. Melt paraffin and pour over the 
top of the jelly. Put on covers. 

APPLE JELLY* 

Wipe the apples, remove stem and blossom ends, and 
cut in quarters. Put in a preserving kettle, and add cold 
water to come nearly to top of apples. Cover, and cook 
slowly until apples are soft; mash, and drain through a 
coarse sieve. Avoid squeezing apples, which makes jelly 
cloudv. Then allow^ juice to drip through a double thick- 
ness of cheesecloth or a jelly bag. Boil twenty minutes, and 
add an equal measure of heated sugar; boil five minutes, 
skim, test and turn into hot sterilized glasses. Put in a 
sunny window and let stand twenty- four hours. Cover, 
and keep in a cool, dry place. 

To Heat Sugar. Put in a granite dish, place in oven, 
leaving oven door ajar, and stir occasionally. 

CURRANT JELLY* 

Currants should not be picked directly after rain. 
Cherry currants make the best jelly. Equal proportions of 
red and white currants are considered desirable, and make 
a lighter colored jelly. 

Pick over currants, but do not remove stems ; wash and 
drain. Mash a few in the bottom of a preserving kettle, 
using a wooden potato masher, and continue until berries 
are used. Cook slowly until currants are broken and look 
white. Strain through a coarse strainer, then allow juice 
to drip through a double thickness of cheesecloth or jelly 
1)ag. Pleasure, heat to the boiling point and boil five min- 
utes ; add an ec{ual measure of heated sugar, boil three 
minutes, skim and pour into hot sterilized glasses. Let 
stand twenty- four hours. Cover and keep in a cool, dry 
place.

GRAPE JELLY* 

Grapes should be picked over, washed and stems removed 
before putting into a preserving kettle. Heat to boiling 
point, mash and cook twenty minutes, then proceed as for 
making currant jelly. 

WINTER JELLY MAKING 

Fruit juices may be canned and made into jelly as 
wanted during the winter. Allow 1 cup of sugar to 6 cups 
of juice. Boil juice and sugar for 5 minutes. Pour into 
sterilized bottles or jars. Put into hot-water bath, with the 
water reaching to the neck of the containers. Allow to sim- 
mer 20 to 30 minutes. If jars are used half seal them 
during the simmering. Put absorbent cotton into the necks 
of bottles and when the bottles are taken from the bath 
put in corks, forcing the cotton into the neck. Corks 
should first be boiled and dried to prevent shrinking. They 
may also be boiled in parafiin to make them air-tight. After 
corking the bottles apply melted paraffin to the tops with 
a brush, to make an air-tight seal. Each bottle should be 
labeled and the label should specify the amount of sugar 
used. In making jelly from these juices during the winter 
follow the "Directions for Jelly Making," adding enough 
sugar to give the amount called for. 

FRUIT BUTTERS 

Fruit butters may be made from good sound fruits or 
the sound portions of fruits which are wormy or have been 
bruised. Wash, pare and remove seeds if there are any. 
Cover with water and cook 3 or 4 hours at a low tempera- 
ture, stirring often, until the mixture is of the consistency 
of thick apple sauce. Add sugar to taste when the boiling 
is two-thirds done. Spices may be added to suit the taste 
when the boiling is completed. If the pulp is coarse it 
should be put through a wire sieve or colander. Pour the

jar or smaller jar 5 minutes after the steam begins to es- 
cape. Remove, push snap in place and cool. 

APPLE BUTTER WITH CIDER 

Four quarts of sweet or sterilized cider should be boiled 
down to 2 quarts. To this add 4 quarts of apples peeled 
and cut in small pieces. If the texture of the apples is 
coarse they should be boiled and put through a strainer 
before being added to the cider. Boil this mixture until 
the cider does not separate from the pulp. When two- 
thirds done, add one pound of sugar. One-half teaspoon- 
ful each of cinnamon, allspice and cloves may be added. 
Pour into sterilized jars and sterilize 5 minutes in steam. 

Apple and pear butter may be made by following the 
directions for apple butter with cider, but omitting the 
cider. 

PEACH BUTTER 

Dip peaches in boiling water long enough to loosen the 
skins. Dip in cold water, peel and stone them. Mash and 
cook them without adding any water. Add half as much 
sugar as pulp and cook until thick. Pour into sterilized 
jars and sterilize 5 minutes in steam. 

Plum butter may be made following the directions for 
peach butter. 

APPLE BUTTER WITH GRAPE JUICE 

To every 4 quarts of strained apple sauce add 1 pint of 
grape juice, 1 cup of brown sugar and %. teaspoonful of

CHAPTER XXIX 

HOME DRYING OF VEGETABLES AND FRUITS* 

Winter buying of vegetables and fruits is costly. It 
means that you pay transportation, cold storage and com- 
mission merchants charges and protlts. Summer is the time 
of lowest prices. Summer, therefore, is the time to buy for 
winter use. 

\ egetable and fruit drying have been little practiced 
for a generation or more. There is no desire to detract 
from the importance of canning operations. Drying must 
not be regarded as taking the place of the preservation of 
vegetables and fruits in tins and glass jars. It must be 
viewed as an important adjunct thereto. Drying is im- 
portant and economical in every home, whether on the 
farm, in the village, in the town, or in the city. For city 
dwellers it has the special advantage that little storage 
space is required for the dried fruit. One hundred pounds 
of some fresh vegetables will reduce to 10 pounds in dry- 
ing without loss of food value or much of the flavor. 

DRYING IS SIMPLE 

A strong point in connection whh vegetable and fruit 
drying is the ease with which it may be done. Practically 
all vegetables and fruits may be dried. The process is 
simple. The cost is slight. In every home the necessary 
outfit, in its simplest form, is already at hand. EiYective 
drying may be done on plates or dishes placed in the oven, 
with the oven door partially open. It may be done on the 
back of the kitchen stove, with these same utensils, while 
the oven is being used for baking. It may also be done on 
sheets of paper or lengths of muslin spread in the sun and 
protected from insects and dust. 

*Xational War Garden Commission Bulletin. 

376 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



METHODS OF DRYING 

For home drying, satisfactory results are obtained by 
any one of three principal methods. These are : — 

1. Sun Drying. 

2. Drying by Artificial Heat. 

3. Drying by Air-blast. ( With an electric fan. ) 
These methods may be combined to good advantage. 

SUN DRYING 

Sun Drying has the double advantage of recjuiring no 
expense for fuel and of freedom from danger of overheat- 
ing. For sun drying of vegetables and fruits the simplest 
form is to spread the slices or pieces on sheets of plain 
paper or lengths of muslin and expose them to the sun. 
Muslin is to be preferred if there is danger of sticking. 
Trays may be used instead of paper or muslin. Sun Drying 
rec|uires bright, hot days and a breeze. Once or twice a 
day the product should be turned or stirred and the dry 
pieces taken out. The drying product should l:>e covered 
with cheesecloth tacked to a frame for protection from 
dust and flying insects. If trays are rested on supports 
placed in pans of water the products will be protected from 
crawling insects. Care must be taken to provide protection 
from rain, dew and moths. During rains and just before 
sunset the products should be taken indoors for the purpose 
of protection. 

DRYING BY ARTIFICIAL HEAT 

Drving by artificial heat is done in the oven or on top of 
a cook stove or range, in trays suspended over the stove 
or in a specially constructed drier built at home or pur- 
chased. 

OVEN DRYING 

The simplest form of Oven Drying is to place small 
cpiantities of foodstuffs on plates in a slow oven. In this 

377 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



way leftovers and other bits of food may be saved for 
winter use with sHght trouble and dried while the top of 
the stove is being used. This is especially effective for 
sweet corn. A few sweet potatoes, apples or peas, or 
even a single turnip, may be dried and saved. To keep the 
heat from being too great leave the oven door partially 
open. For oven use a simple tray may be made of galvan- 
ized wire screen of convenient size, with the edges bent up 
for an inch or tw^o on each side. At each corner this trav 
should have a leg an inch or two in length, to hold it up 
from the bottom of the oven and permit circulation of air 
around the product. 

AIR BLAST-ELECTRIC FAN 

The use of an electric fan is an effective means of drying. 
Sliced vegetables or fruits are placed on travs 1 foot wide 
and 3 feet long. These trays are stacked and the fan placed 
close to one end, with the current directed along the trays, 
lengthwise. The number of trays to be used is regulated 
by the size of the fan. Drying by this process may be 
done in twenty-four hours or less. \\^ith sliced string beans 
and shredded sweet potatoes a few^ hours are sufficient, if 
the air is dry. 

SOME OF THE DETAILS OF DRYING 

As a general rule, vegetables or fruits, for Drying, must 
be cut into slices or shreds, with the skin removed. In 
using artificial heat be careful to start at a comparatively 
low temperature and gradually increase. Details as to the 
proper scale of temperatures for various vegetables and 
fruits are given in the directions. To be able to gauge the 
heat accurately a thermometer must be used. An oven 
thermometer may be bought at slight cost, li the ther- 
mometer is placed in a glass of salad oil the true tempera- 
ture of the oven may be obtained. 

378 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



The actual time required for Drying cannot be given, 
and the person in charge must exercise judgment on this 
point. A Httle experience will make it easy to determine 
when products are sufficiently dried. When first taken 
from the Drier vegetables should be rather brittle, but not 
so dry as to snap or crackle, and fruits rather leathery and 
pliable. One method of determining whether fruit is dry 
enough is to scjueeze a handful; if the fruit separates when 
the hand is opened, it is dry enough. Another way is to 
press a single piece; if no moisture comes to the surface 
the piece is sufficiently dry. Berries are dry enough if 
they stick to the hand but do not crush when sciueezed. 

Raspberries, particularly, should not be dried too hard, 
as this will keep them from resuming their natural shape 
wdien soaked in water for use. Material will mold if not 
dried enough. 
PREPARING FOOD MATERIAL FOR DRYING 

A sharp kitchen knife will serve every purpose in slicing 
and cutting vegetables and fruits for Drying, if no other 
device is at hand. The thickness of the slices should be 
from an eighth to a Cjuarter of an inch. Whether sliced 
or cut into strips, the pieces should be small so as to dry 
quickly. They should not, however, be so small as to make 
them hard to handle or to keep them from being used to 
advantage in preparing dishes for the table such as would 
be prepared from fresh products. 

Food choppers, kraut slicers or rotary slicers may be 
used to prepare food for drying. 

Vegetables and fruits for Drying should be fresh, young 
and tender. As a general rule, vegetables will dry better 
if cut into small pieces with the skins removed. Berries 
are dried whole. Apples, quinces, peaches and pears dry 
better if cut into rings or quarters. Cleanliness is impera- 
tive. Knives and slicing devices must be carefully cleansed 
before and after use. A knife that is not bright and clean 
will discolor the product on which it is used, and this should 
be avoided. 

379 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



BLANCHING AND COLD-DIPPING 

Blanching is desirable for successful vegetable Drying. 
Blanching gives more thorough cleansing, removes objec- 
tionable odors and flavors, and softens and loosens the 
fibre, allowing c[uicker and more uniform evaporation of 
the moisture, and gives better color. It is done by placing 
the vegetables in a piece of cheesecloth, a wire basket or 
other porous container and plunging them into boiling 
water. The time required for this is short and varies with 
different vegetables. Blanching should l)e followed by the 
c(jld-dip, which means plunging the vegetables into cold 
water for an instant after removing from the boiling water. 
Cold-dipping hardens the pulp and sets the coloring mat- 
ter. After blanching and dipping, the surface moisture 
may be removed by placing the vegetables between two 
towels. 

DANGER FROM INSECTS 

In addition to exercising great care to protect vegetables 
and fruits from insects during the Drying process, pre- 
cautions should be taken with the finished product to pre- 
vent the hatching of eggs that may have been deposited. 
One measure that is useful is to subject the dried material 
to a heat of 160° F, for from 5 to 10 minutes before stor- 
ing it away. By the application of this heat the eggs will 
be killed. Be careful not to apply heat long enough to dam- 
age the product. 

CONDITION BEFORE STORING 

It is important to "condition"' Dried Products before 
storing them for the winter. This means that they should 
be placed in boxes and poured from one box to another 
once a day for three or four days to mix thoroughly. If 
any part of the material is then found to be too moist, 
return to Drier for a short Drying. Practically all dried 
products should be conditioned. 

380 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



STORAGE FOR DRIED PRODUCTS 

Of importance equal to proper Drying is the proper 
packing and storage of the finished product. With the 
scarcity of tins and the high prices of glass jars it is rec- 
ommended that other containers be used. Those easily 
available are baking powder cans and similar covered tins, 
pasteboard boxes having tight-fitting covers, strong paper 
bags and patented parafiin paper boxes, which may be 
bought in c[uantities at comparatively low cost. 

A paraffin container of the type used by oyster dealers 
for the delivery of oysters will be found inexpensive and 
easily handled, li using this, or a baking powder can or 
similar container, after filling adjust the cover closely. 
The cover should then be sealed. To do this paste a strip of 
paper around the top of the can, covering the joint between 
can and cover, for the purpose of excluding air. Paste- 
board boxes should also be sealed in this way. Paraffin 
containers should be sealed by applying melted paraffin with 
a brush to the joint. 

If a paper bag is used, the top should be twisted, doubled 
over and tied with a string. IMoisture may be kept out of 
paper bags by coating them, using a brush dipped into 
melted paraffin. Another good precaution is to store bags 
within an ordinary lard pail or can or other tin vessel hav- 
ing a closely fitting cover. 

The products should be stored in a cool, dry place, well 
ventilated and protected from rats, mice and insects. In 
sections where the air is very moist, moisture-proof con- 
tainers must be used. It is good practice to use small con- 
tainers so that it may not be necessary to leave the contents 
exposed long after opening and before vising. 

For convenience label all packages. 

WINTER USE OF DRIED PRODUCTS 

In preparing dried vegetables and fruits for use the first 
process is to restore the w^ater which has been dried out of 

381 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



them. All dried foods require long soaking. After soak- 
ing the dried products will have a better flavor if cooked in 
a covered utensil at a low temperature for a long time. 
Dried products should be prepared and served as fresh 
products are prepared and served. They should be cooked 
in the water in which they have been soaked, as this 
utilizes all of the mineral salts, which would otherwise 
be wasted. 

There can be no definite rule for the amount of water 
required for soaking dried products when they are to be 
used, as the quantity of water evaporated in the drying 
process varies with different vegetables and fruits. As a 
general rule, from 3 to 4 cups of water will be reciuired 
for 1 cup of dried material. 

In preparing for use, peas, beans, spinach and like vege- 
tables should be boiled in water to which there has been 
added soda in the proportion of J'^ teaspoonful of soda to 
1 quart of water. This improves the color of the product. 

In preparing to serve dried vegetables season them care- 
fully. For this purpose celerv. mustard, onion, cheese and 
nutmeg give desirable flavoring, according to taste. 

From 3 to 4 quarts of vegetable soup may be made from 
4 ounces of dried soup vegetables. 

DIRECTIONS FOR VEGETABLE DRYING 
ASPARAGUS 

The edible portion should be blanched from 3 to 5 min- 
utes, cold dipped, the stalks slit lengthwise into two strips 
if of small or medium size or into four strips if of large 
size. Drying time, 4 to 8 hours. Start at temperature of 
110° F. and raise gradually to 140°. 

The hard ends of the stalk, which are not edible, should 
be dried for soup stock. Blanch 10 minutes, cold dip, slice 
into 2 to 6 pieces, according to size, and dry as described 
above.

BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

The drying process is the same as with cauliflower, with 
the addition of a pinch of soda to the blanching- water. 

BEETS 

Boil whole until more than three-fourths cooked, with- 
out removing skin. After dipping in cold water, peel and 
cut into % to ^inch slices. Drying time, two and one- 
half to three hours. Start at temperature of 110° F. and 
raise gradually to 150°. 

BEET TOPS AND SWISS CHARD 

Select tops of young beets or Swiss chard suitable for 
greens. Wash carefully, cut leaf-stalk and blade into 
pieces % of an inch long, spread on screens and dry. 

CABBAGE 

Take heads that are well developed. Remove all loose 
outside leaves. Shred or cut into strips a few inches long. 
Cut the core crosswise several times, and shred it for dry- 
ing with the rest of the cabbage. Blanch 10 minutes, cold 
dip, drain, remove surface moisture. Drying time, 3 hours. 
Start at temperature of 110° F. and raised gradually to 
145°. 



CARROTS AND PARSNIPS 

Clean thoroughly and remove outer skin, preferably with 
a stiff bristle brush ; or the skin may be removed by paring 
or scraping. Slice into thickness of j/s of an inch. Blanch 
6 minutes, cold dip and remove surface moisture. Drying 
time, 2V2 to 3 hours. Start at temperature of 110° F. and 
raise gradually to 150°. 

Kohl-rabi, Celeriac and Salsify are dried in the same way 
as Carrots and Parsnips.

will regain part of its original color in soaking and cooking. 
Dried Cauliflower is specially good for soups and omelets. 

CELERY 

After washing carefully, cut into 1-inch pieces, l)lanch 
three minutes, cold-dip and remove surface moisture. Dry 
slowdy. Drying time, three to four hours. Start at tem- 
perature of 110° F. and raise to 140°. 

GARDEN PEAS 

Garden peas with non-edible pod are taken when of size 
suitable for table use. Blanch 3 to 5 minutes, cold-dip, re- 
move surface moisture and spread in single layers on trays. 
Drying time, 3 to 3^ hours. Start at temperature of 110° 
F., raising slowdy, in about 1 or 1^2 hours, to 145°, and 
then continue 1 and 1>4 to 2 hours at 145°. 

For use in soups or puree, shell mature peas, pass them 
through a meat grinder, spread the pulp on trays and dry. 

With young and tender sugar peas use the pod also. 
After washing, cut into Y^ inch pieces. Blanch 6 minutes, 
cold-dip and remove surface moisture. Drying time, 3 to 
3;|/2 hours. Start at temperature of 110° F. and raise grad- 
ually to 145°. 

GREEN STRING BEANS 

Select only such beans as are in perfect condition for 
table use. Wash carefully and string. If full grown, they 
should be slit lengthwise or cut — not snapped — into pieces 
^4 to 1 inch long. H young and tender, dry them whole. 
Blanch 6 to 10 minutes. To set color add one-half tea-

spoonful of soda to each gallon of boiling water. After 
blanching, dip quickly into cold water, then drain thor- 
oughly to remove surface moisture. Drying time for young 
beans, two hours; for those more mature, three hours. 
Start at temperature of 110° F. and raise gradually to 145°. 

GREENS AND HERBS 

After washing carefully and removing leaves, slice, and 
dry in sun or by artificial heat, following directions for 
cabbage, li steam is not easily available, dry without 
blanching or cold dipping. 

These directions apply to spinach, kale, dandelions and 
parsley. 

Celery tops, mint, sage and herbs of all kinds for flavor- 
ing are treated in the same way. 

LIMA BEANS 

If lima beans are gathered when young and tender, shell 
them, wash, and then blanch 5 to 10 minutes, the time 
varying with maturity and size. Cold-dip. Remove sur- 
face moisture. Drying time, 3 to SjA hours. Start at 
temperature of 110° F. and raise gradually to 145°. 

OKRA 

After washing, blanch three minutes in boiling water 
with one-half teaspoonful of soda to each gallon. Cold- 
dip. With young and tender pods dry whole ; cut older pods 
into 34 inch slices. Drying time, two to three hours. Start 
at temperature of 110° F. and raise gradually to 140°. 

Okra may also be dried by being strung on a string and 
hung over the stove. This should not be done except with 
young and tender pods. Heat in oven before storing.

ONIONS AND LEEKS 

After washing, peeling and cutting into >,s and^ inch 
sHces for onions, and ^ inch strips for leeks, blanch in 
boiling water or steam for 5 minutes, cold-dip and remove 
surface moisture. Drying time, 23/2 to 3 hours. Start 
at temperature of 110° F. and raise gradually to 140°. 

PEPPERS 

Steam until skin softens; or place in biscuit pan in oven 
and heat until skin blisters. Peel, split in half, take out 
seed. Start drying at temperature of 110° F. and grad- 
ually increase to 140°. Thick fleshed peppers, such as 
pimentoes, must be dried very slowly and evenly. Small 
varieties of red peppers may be spread in the sim until 
wilted and the drying finished in a drier, or they may be 
entirely dried in the sun. 

Another plan for drying peppers is to split them on one 
side, remove seed, start with air drying and finish in a 
drier at 140°. 

PUMPKIN AND SUMMER SQUASH 

Cut into j/S inch strips and pare. Blanch three minutes. 
Cold-dip, remove surface moisture and dry slowly. Dry- 
ing time, three to four hours. Start at temperature of 
110° F. and raise to 140°. 11ie strips may be hung on 
strings and dried in the kitchen above the stove. 

RHUBARB 

Slit the larger stems lengthwise, cut into y'l to Yx inch 
lengths. Do not use the leaf. Blanch three minutes and 
cold-dip. Drv thoroughly. Start at temperature of 110° 
F. and raise gradually to 140°. 

SOUP MIXTURES 

Vegetables for soup mixtures are prepared and dried 
separately. These are mixed as desired.

SWEET CORN 

Select ears that are young and tender and freshly gath- 
ered. Blanch on cob in steam or boiling water — preferably 
steam — for 5 to 10 minutes to set milk. H boiling water is 
used, add a teaspoonful of salt to each gallon. Cold-dip, 
drain thoroughly, and with a sharp knife cut off in layers 
or cut ofif half the kernel and scrape ofif the remainder, tak- 
ing care not to include the chaff. Drying time, 3 to 4 
hours. Start at temperature of 110° F. and raise grad- 
ually to 145°. 

In using field corn it should be taken at the roasting ear 
period of ripeness, and the ears should be plump. 

To prepare for sun-drying, corn may first be dried in the 
oven for 10 or 15 minutes. After sun-drying is completed 
the corn should again be heated in oven to 145° F. to kill 
possible insect eggs. 

SWEET POTATOES 

Wash, boil until almost cooked, peel, slice or run through 
meat chopper, spread on trays and dry until brittle. Sliced 
sweet potatoes may be dried without boiling. If this is 
done, dipping in cold water just before drying will brighten 
color. 

TOMATOES 

Blanch long enough to loosen skin, cold-dip, peel, slice 
to thickness of % of an inch. Start at temperature of 
110° F. and gradually raise to 145°, continuing until thor- 
oughly dried. Another method is, after peeling, to cut 
orosswise in center, sprinkle with sugar and dry at tem- 
perature as above until the finished product resembles dried 
figs. 

WAX BEANS 

These are dried in the same manner as orreen string: 
beans.

DIRECTIONS FOR FRUIT DRYING 

Fruit may be dried in the sun until the surface begins 
to wrinkle, then finished in the drier. With stone fruits, 
such as peaches, plums, apricots and cherries, none but 
fruits that are fresh, ripe and in perfect condition should 
be used. With apples, pears and quinces, effective thrift 
calls for using the sound portions of fruit that may be par- 
tially wormy or imperfect. When properly dried, fruits 
should be entirely free from moisture when pressed be- 
tween the fingers on removal from drier. Line trays with 
cheesecloth or wrapping paper before spreading fruit on 
them. 

BERRIES 

Pick over, removing all leaves and stems, wash, if 
necessary, and remove surface moisture, handling with 
care to prevent bruising. Spread in thin layers and dry 
slowly. The total drying time is four to five hours. Start 
at temperature of 110° F., raising to 125° in about two 
hours. Then raise temperature to 140° and maintain two 
to three hours longer. 

CHERRIES 

After washing and removing surface moisture, spread 
unpitted in thin layers. Drying time, two to four hours. 
Start at temperature of 110° F. and raise gradually to 
150°. If preferred, the pits may be removed, although this 
causes loss of juice. 

PLUMS AND APRICOTS 

Select fruits which are ripe. Remove pits by cutting 
fruit open with a sharp knife. Arrange halves on trays. 
Start drying at temperature of 110° F. and raise gradually 
to 145°. These fruits are usually dried with skins on. 

388 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



APPLES, PEARS AND QUINCES 

Pare, core and slice, dropping slices into cold water con- 
taining eight teaspoon fills of salt to the gallon, if a light 
colored product is desired. Leaving them a minute or two 
in the salt water will prevent discoloration. (If preferred, 
core the whole fruit, after peeling, and slice into rings, 
dipping these for a minute or two into cold salted water 
as described above.) Remove surface moisture. Drying 
time, 4 to 6 hours, or until leathery and pliable. Start at 
temperature of 110° F. and raise gradually to 150°. Pears 
may be steamed ten minutes after slicing and before drying. 
Quinces are treated in the same way as pears. 

PEACHES 

Dip peaches into boiling water long enough to loosen 
skins. Then dip in cold water and peel. Cut into halves 
or quarters, remove stones and dry as directed for apples.

CHAPTER XXX 

PICKLING AND SALTING* 

Pickling is an important branch of home preparedness 
for the winter months. Pickles have little food value, but 
they give a flavor to a meal which is liked by many. They 
should not be given to children. 

In pickling, vegetables are usually soaked over night in 
a brine made of 1 cup of salt and 1 quart of water. This 
brine removes the water of the vegetable and so prevents 
weakening of the vinegar. In the morning the brine is 
drained off. 

Alum should not be used to make the vegetables crisp as 
it is harmful to the human body. A firm product is ob- 
tained if the vegetables are not cooked too long or at too 
high a temperature. 

Spices, unless confined in a bag, give a dark color to the 
pickles. 

Enameled, agate or porcelain-lined kettles should be used 
when cooking mixtures containing vinegar. 

Pickles put in crocks should be well covered with vinegar 
to prevent molding. 

Instructions for some of the most commonly used 
methods are given herewith.

SALTING 

The use of brine in preparing vegetables for winter use 
has much to commend it to the household. Preserving cab- 
bage, string beans and greens for winter use by salting is 
a method which has long been used. To do this the vege- 
tables should be w'ashed, drained and weighed. The amount 
of salt needed will be one-fourth of the weight of the vege- 
tables. Kegs or crocks make satisfactory containers. Put 
a layer of vegetables about an inch thick on the bottom of 
me container. Co\'er this with salt. Continue making 
alternate layers of vegetables and salt until the container 
is almost filled. The salt should be evenly distributed so 
that it will not be necessary to use more salt than the c[uan- 
tity required in proportion to the vegetables used. Cover 
the surface with a cloth and a board or glazed plate. Place 
a weight on these and set aside in a cool place. If sufficient 
liquor to cover the vegetables has not been extracted by the 
next day, pour in enough strong brine ( 1 pound of salt 
to 2 quarts of water) to cover surface around the cover. 
The top layer of vegetables should be kept under the brine 
to prevent molding. There will be some bubbling at first. 

395 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



As soon as this stops set the container where it will not 
be disturbed until ready for use. Seal by pouring very hot 
paraffin on the surface. 

THE USE OF BRINE 

This method is used for cucumbers, string beans, green 
tomatoes, beets, corn and peas, as these vegetables do not 
contain enough water for a good brine using only salt. 
Wash and put in a crock or other container within 3 or 4 
inches of the top. Pour over them a brine made by adding 
to every 4 quarts of water used Yi pint of vinegar and ^ 
cup salt. The amount of brine needed will be about ^ the 
volume of the material to be fermented. When fermenta- 
tion is complete the container should be sealed. 

TO FERMENT CUCUMBERS 

Wash the cucumbers carefully. Pack them in a keg, bar- 
rel or crock, leaving space at the top for the cover. Cover 
them with a brine made by adding to every 4 quarts of 
water used ^ pint of vinegar and ^)4 cup of salt. The 
amount of brine needed will be one-half of the volume of 
the material to be fermented. Place a wooden cover or 
glazed plate on top of the contents and press it down by 
weighting it with a stone or other weight, to keep the cu- 
cumbers under the brine. Fermentation will require from 
8 to 10 days in warm weather and from 2 to 4 weeks in 
cool weather. It is complete when bubbles cease to rise 
when the container is lightly tapped or jarred. When this 
stage is reached remove any scum which may have col- 
lected, pour hot paraffin over the cover and around the 
weight and store in a cool place. 

GREEN TOMATOES 

The process for green tomatoes is the same as that for 
cucumbers. 

396 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



BEETS AND STRING BEANS 

RemoA^e the strings from beans. Beets should be washed 
thoroughly and packed whole. Spices may be used, as 
with cucumbers, bvit these may be omitted if the vegetables 
are to be freshened by soaking, when they are to be used. 

The method is the same as with cucumbers. 

PREPARING FOR USE 

To prepare these vegetables for use the brine should be 
drained oft" and the vegetables soaked in clear, cold water 
for several hours with one or two changes of water. They 
may then be cooked as fresh vegetables, with at least one 
change of water while cooking. 

With salted vegetables it may be necessary to change the 
water once or twice while boiling. This is a matter of 
taste. Fermented vegetables should be rinsed in fresh 
water after removing from the container. To retain the 
acid flavor do not soak in water before cooking. 

If cooked without soaking, fermented dandelions, 
spinach, kale and other greens will have a flavor similar to 
that of the greens in their fresh state. 

Fermented corn should be soaked several hours, with 
three or four changes of water. During the cooking also 
there should be one change of water. The corn may then 
be used in chowder, pudding, omelet, fritters or waffles. 

Salted string beans should be soaked to remove the salt 
and then prepared and served as fresh beans are prepared 
and served. Fermented string beans may be cooked with- 
out soaking and served as the fresh beans are served. 
Young and tender string beans mav be eaten raw.

CHAPTER XXXI 

FOOD FOR THE SICK 

'Tn preparing food for an invalid the tray should be of 
correct size, so that when set it will not have the appear- 
ance of being overcrowded. If a small amount of food 
is to be served, use a small tray. The tray cloth should be 
spotless and fit over edge of tray. If the correct size is 
not at hand, a napkin may be utilized by folding it to fit the 
tray. Select the choicest china, silver and glassware, mak- 
ing changes as often as possible. 

In setting a tray, after laying the tray cloth, place the 
plate. Have the knife at the right of the plate, sharp edge 
toward plate. Place the spoon at the right of the knife, 
bowl up. Place the fork at the left of plate, tines up. A 
bread and butter plate or individual butter is placed over 
fork a little to the left. The napkin is always placed at the 
left of the fork; then the cup and saucer at the right of 
spoon, with cup so placed that it may be easily raised by 
handle. The water glass is placed over the knife a little 
to the right. Arrange the other dishes to suit the con- 
venience of the patient." (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

In cases of severe illness the physician gives advice con- 
cerning the diet and his instructions should be implicitly 
obeyed. However, the physician's advice is often very gen- 
eral where the diet is not a prominent factor in the treat- 
ment of the case; and, too, manv minor illnesses where the 
advice of a physician is not necessarv require some modifi- 
cation of the ordinary food for the family. So the home 
nurse should thoroughly understand the general principles 
of feeding. 

Invalid diets are classified as Fluid Diet, Soft or Semi- 
Solid Diet and Light or Convalescent Diet. 

399 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Fluid Diet. "Since all food must eventually be reduced 
to fluid form for absorption, a liquid diet is usually re- 
garded as the type easiest to digest and is often prescribed 
by the physician." 

Liquid diet includes : — 

1. Milk, plain or modified to make it more digestible, 
more nutritious, or more attractive. 

2. Broths and clear soups. 

3. Beef juice and beef tea. 

4. Cereal gruels. 

5. Raw eggs combined with water, milk, fruit juice, etc. 
Soft or Semi-Solid Diet. 

This is the intermediate diet between the fluid diet and 
the simple mixed diet and is generally more acceptable to 
the patient. It includes everything that is found in the 
liquid diet, and, in addition, soft cooked eggs, soups, broths, 
toast, delicate cream soups, chicken broth, soft custards, 
fruit gelatines, light puddings. 

Light or Convalescent Diet. 

During convalescence the digestive tract participates in 
the weakness of the rest of the body and special attention 
should be given the diet. 

"The diet should be simple^ — only a few kinds of food at 
a time and those plainly but carefully cooked and seasoned. 

Meals should be served with strict regularity. 

The appetite should be tempted by the appearance of the 
tray." 

Convalescent diet includes foods from the fluid and soft 
diets with other easily digested and nourishing foods added. 
The amount and variety may be increased from day to day. 

Special Diets- — are those ordered by the physician for 
individual cases, such as for diabetes, gout, tuberculosis, 
etc.

ACID BEVERAGES 

Beverages made from fruit juices are cooling and re- 
freshing and especially grateful to fever patients. 

Wash lemons and oranges, and when using the juice re- 
move the seeds. 

Whenever cold water is to be used instead of very hot 
or boiling water in preparing drinks, it is better to use 
sugar syrup for sweetening in place of sugar, which re- 
quires time to dissolve.

trinized, and the bread is thus rendered easier of diges- 
tion.

CHAPTER XXXU 

TABLE SERVICE 

Rules for laying the table and all methods of serving 
have been formulated to bring about neatness, convenience, 
and order. The occasion, size of the dining room, the num- 
ber of guests, and the servants, all have to be considered in 
planning for serving a meal. Therefore the method of 
serving is governed by conditions. 

Three styles of table service are in use in American 
homes. These are known as the Russian, the English, 
and the American styles. 

The Russian style of service is the most formal. All 
food is served from the side table or pantry by the atten- 
dants, upon whom falls the entire responsibility of the 
service. Upon the table are placed only decorations and 
the individual covers and, sometimes, such dishes as olives, 
nuts, almonds, bon-bons, which may very properly form 
a portion of the table decorations. This form of service 
is best adapted for formal dinners and luncheons. It may 
also be used for all meals by those who care for form and 
have a full staff of well-trained servants, but it should not 
be carried out unless there is at least one waitress for each 
eight persons. 

The English style of service breathes hospitality rather 
than formality. It permits personal attention on the part 
of the host and hostess to the needs of those about them. 
The food is served from the table, the hostess serving the 
soup, the salad and the dessert, and the host carving and 
serving the fish and roast. The vegetables may also be 
placed upon the table and may be served by some one at the 
table or passed by the waitress. Except for relishes, bread 

427 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



and butter, and such foods as pertain alike to all courses, 
only one course appears at a time on the table. Everything 
pertaining to one course is removed before another course 
is served. This is the style of service often emploved in 
homes where no servants, or only one, is kept. 

The American style of service is a combination of the 
Russian and the English styles. In some courses, the food 
(especially if it presents an attractive appearance) is served 
from the table according to the English custom; in other 
courses, the food is served in the Russian manner. It is a 
simpler and more home-like service than the Russian and 
somewhat more formal than the English. 

The dining room should be cleaned, aired and dusted. Care 
should be taken that it is well lighted and that the tem- 
perature is comfortable, about sixty-eight degrees Fahren- 
heit. 

Table Coverings. There are, in general use, two ways 
of covering the table : one, covering the whole table; that is, 
using a tablecloth; the other, covering only portions of the 
table by the use of a center piece and doilies, or a lunch- 
cloth. Sometimes the tablecloth is used for dinner, and 
doilies or lunchcloth for the other two meals. The use of 
small pieces of linen in place of the larger tablecloth is often 
a great saving of labor. Tablecloths must be ironed when 
they are very damp, in order to give them a smooth, glossy 
finish. To iron a three-yard tablecloth well means the work 
of at least forty-five minutes. When one or two spots are 
made on the cloth it necessitates washing it, while in the 
case of doilies, the soiled ones may be removed and others 
substituted, which means comparatively little w^ork to keep 
the linen on the table clean. Unless, however, the table is 
well finished, a tablecloth is preferable. 

It is correct to use at any meal a cloth that entirely 
covers the table. But for a breakfast, luncheon or supper, 
a bare table, carefully polished, may be used wath a luncheon 
cloth, runners, or doilies placed upon it. If doilies are used, 
a doily is placed where each plate is to be set. The doilies 

428 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



and the centerpiece should be of the same pattern. The 
doily on which a hot dish is to be placed should have a 
flannel lining under it to preserve the polish of the table. 

If a tablecloth that entirely covers the table is to be used, 
first place a thick cloth of felt, canton flannel or asbestos 
to cover the table. This is called the " silence cloth " and 
not only protects a polished table but prevents noise in set- 
ting silver and china in place. 

Put on the tablecloth, folds up, with the center of the 
cloth in the center of the table, and the folds straight Vk'ith 
the edge of the table, li possible, have flowers, a ""crn o; 
plant in the center of the table. 

Napkins should be folded and placed at the left of the 
plate. A dinner napkin is folded four times; a luncheon 
napkin is folded twice to form a square or three times for 
either a triangle or oblong. 

The arrangement of the table in general and of each cover 
in particular is of the utmost importance. All articles 
should be systematically and regularly placed upon the table 
and covers should be placed opposite each other. 

Dishes of olives, celery, radishes, pickles, are sometimes 
placed upon the table, though they are, as are the nuts, bon- 
bons, and relishes, more commonly offered at proper times 
by the waitress. They are often passed between courses. 
As a general thing, the host and hostess should be seated 
directly opposite one another and the " covers " arranged 
symmetrically on either side. 
The Cover 

A "cover " is the place at the table for each person and 
consists of the plate, napkin, glass, silver, and other articles 
needed for the meal. 

At least twenty-two inches of space should be allowed 
for a cover. 

On formal occasions the " place " or " service " plate 
which is usually an ordinary dinner plate, is the basis of 
each cover. 



429 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



The oyster plate and soup plate may be placed in turn 
upon it and later it is exchanged for the plate upon which 
the first hot course after the soup is served. 

llie quantity of china on the table depends upon the occa- 
sion and style of serving. In any form of service, the first 
course, if cold should be placed on the table before the guests 
are seated. If the first course is a hot food, it is always 
placed upon the table after the guests are seated. 

For informal occasions, the bread and butter plate is used, 
this is placed above and a little to the left of the tines of the 
fork. Glasses are filled three-quarters full and placed just 
beyond the tip of the knife. A salt and pepper should be 
placed so as to be convenient for each two covers. 

If the serving is to be done without a maid, it is advisable 
to place all of the china (except that which must be kept 
warm), glass, and silver to be used for the meal either on 
the table or on the serving table. 
Setting the Table 

The silver is placed in the order in which it is to be used 
beginning with that piece farthest from the plate. All silver 
is placed one inch from the edge of the table and at right 
angles to it. The knives are placed at the right of the 
plate with the sharp edge turned toward the plate; the 
spoons at the right, outside the knives with the inside of 
the bowl turned up, the soup spoon being outside the others 
with the exception of the oyster fork which is placed out- 
side the knives and spoons at the right. 

W hen the number of courses is such that little silver is 
required, all silver may be placed on the table before the 
meal is announced ; when more than that placed on the table 
is required it is laid quietly with the course with which it is 
to be used. The table is not often set with more than three 
pieces on each side of the plate. It is best to lay dessert 
spoons and forks and coffee spoons by the plate at the 
time of serving. All silver should be kept at an ecjual dis- 
tance from the edge of the table, on a line with the plate and 
napkin. Bread and butter spreaders, when used may be 

430 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



placed at the right with the other knives, or across the right 
side of the hread and hutter plate with the blade turned 
toward the center of the plate. 

Though bread is not always served on formal occasions, 
sometimes a roll, a bread stick or a square of bread cut 
two inches thick is either laid upon the napkin or slipped 
between the folds of the napkin. 

At formal dinners the place card is often used for con- 
venience in seating the guests — a plain card inscribed in 
the hostess' hand with the name of the person for whom the 
seat is intended is most often used. These cards may have 
in the upper left hand corner, or in the center, the mono- 
gram, or initials of the hostess, or a dainty painting. They 
are placed upon the napkins. 

The side table should be laid with care. Extra silver 
and a napkin like that pertaining to an individual cover — to 
be used in case of an emergency — are placed on the table. 
Any other extra china, glass, serving silver or cutlery which 
mav be rec[uired should be ready on a side table as well as 
the napkin and tray to be used for crumbing. A napkin 
for handling hot plates and dishes should be at hand also. 

Just before the meal is announced see that the glasses 
are filled and the water pitcher is refilled. Place butter on 
each bread and butter plate and see that a supply is at hand. 
See that bread is cut. Serve hot food on warm dishes, cold 
food on cold dishes. 

Arrange all dishes in order for each separate course. 
Place the finger bowls on dessert plates with doilies and 
fill one-third full before the meal is announced. The guest 
himself will remove the bowl and doily before the dessert 
is passed. 

Have a small tray with a doily ready for passing sugar, 
cream, and small dishes and for removing salt, peppers and 
extra silver in clearing the table. 
General Rules for Serving : 
Work noiselessly. 
Never pile dishes. 

431 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Have a reason for everything you do. 

Bring in serving dishes first, then the food. 

Remove the food first, then soiled china and silver, and 
last clean china and silver. 

Everything needed only for one course should be removed 
before serving another course. 

Crumbs are removed before the dessert course and be- 
tween other courses if necessary, a clean napkin and 
plate being used for this purpose. 

Dishes which admit of choice are passed at the left, 
held in left hand low enough so that the guest may serve 
himself easily. This is done so that the guest may con- 
veniently use his right hand. 

Dishes which do not admit of choice may be placed from 
the right but everything may be passed, placed, and re- 
moved from the left, excepting that drinks which are to be 
kept at the right side of the plate should always be placed 
there. 

When the Russian style of serving is observed, the fol- 
lowing plan of removing and placing plates at the close of a 
course is followed : 

Carry the clean or served plate of the following course 
in the right hand and go to the left of the guest. Remove 
the soiled plate of the course just concluded with the left 
hand and then place the empty or served plate before the 
guest with the right hand. Then go to the kitchen or pantry 
with the soiled plate, return with a clean or served plate 
and proceed as before. 

In following the English or American style of serving, if 
the first course is cold it may be on the table when the guests 
are seated. If the soup is the first course, place the soup 
plates on the place plates from the right, holding them in the 
right hand. Next remove the soup plates from the left of 
the guest (or remove soup and service plate and replace with 
a hot sen'ing plate). 

In serving the main course, first place the dish to be sensed 
(the platter of meat, for example) in front of the host. An 

432 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



empty plate is placed before the host. Next get another 
clean plate, return to the left of the host, take up the served 
plate in the left hand and place the empty plate before him. 
Then go to the left of the guest and exchange the filled 
plate for place plate, return to side table to leave place plate. 
Again go to the left of the host, place a plate before him 
and proceed as before. 

Serve the hostess first, then the guest at the host's right, 
then all on that side of the table, then the guest at the left of 
the host and all on that side. 

When all the guests have been served to meat take the 
potatoes in the left hand ( on a napkin ) place a serving spoon 
and fork in the dish, and pass to each guest at the left. 
Pass the other vegetables in the same way. Pass vegetables 
a second time. See that glasses are filled. 

\Mien are all finished remove the roast; if a carving cloth 
is used, fold and remove it. Remove the plates as before, re- 
placing them with salad plates. When all are finished re- 
move salad plates and bread and butter plates. 

Remove all silver not used, salts and peppers and relislies, 
using the tray. 

Remove every thing from the table except the glasses, 
nuts or bon-bons. Crumb the table. 

Place the dessert plates ( with finger bowls ) at each 
cover. The silver may be placed at the right or may be laid 
on the plate with the finger bowl. 

Bring dessert and place before the hostess. Place the 
serving spoon and fork. 

Standing at the hostess' left, replace filled dessert plate 
with an empty one. Serve the guest at right of the host 
first, exchanging a filled dessert plate for the empty one. 
Return to the hostess and repeat until all are served. 

Pass the cake or wafers. 

The cofi:'ee may be served by the hostess either in the 
dining room or living room. 

Refill water glasses by handling from the bottom, draw 
to edge of table and fill, then put back in place. 

433 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Number of Courses 

Two or three courses are enough for every day comfort 
and heahh. In formal serving, it is good taste not to have 
too many courses. A first course of grape fruit, fruit or 
oyster cocktail, a soup, a fish course, or some substitute 
for it, the main course with meat or fowl, a salad, dessert 
and coffee are sufficient. 

The guests of honor sit at the right of the host and 
hostess. Either the hostess or the guest of honor may be 
served first.

CHAPTER XXXHI 

FOODS 

The choice, care, preparation and serving of food are 
topics of vital interest to every homemaker. Until within 
the last few years experience — as represented by the prac- 
tice of the best housekeepers — has been the chief source of 
information on these subjects, and such experience is in 
many respects a good and safe guide. But many scientific 
investigations as to the composition and nutritive value of 
food have been carried out so that we now have much 
authoritative knowledge on the subject. 

NEEDS OF THE HUMAN BODY 

The human body has often been compared to a steam en- 
gine in which the food we eat takes the part of fuel. This 
comparison is partly true, but is inadec|uate. A steam en- 
gine gradually wears out with use. Then the worn or 
broken parts must be replaced from some source without it- 
self. The human body also wears away, but — unlike the 
steam engine — it has the power of rebuilding its own parts 
from the fuel (food) which it consumes. It can also bring 
about certain chemical changes whereby its fuel (food) is 
converted into new forms either for immediate use or for 
storage within the body against future needs. Hence the 
value of food depends in part upon its capacity to produce 
needed heat and energy, and in part upon its capacity to 
supply material for growth and repair of body waste. 

Food is any substance which, when taken into the body, 
supplies it with energy or builds tissue. Foods are oxidized 
or burned in the body and that oxidation produces energy. 
They produce just as much energy when burned in the body 
as fat or sugar would produce if burned in a stove. The 

443 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



energy produced in the body by the oxidation of foods is 
used to maintain the normal temperature of the body; to 
carry on the vital processes, — as digestion, circulation, 
respiration ; and for work and activity. 

The body is made up of a collection of cells, and groups 
of these cells, having special functions, make up the tissues 
and organs of the body. The cells and tissues of the body 
are being constantly worn out. and new ones must be built 
up from the food taken into the body. The oxidation of 
food and cells in the body constitutes the vital process called 
life. 

The cells and tissues contain nitrogen and hence the only 
foods that will build tissues are those which contain nitro- 
gen. A food which contains carbon will yield heat and 
energy when oxidized. 

Foods are grouped into five classes — proteins, carbohy- 
drates, fats and oils, mineral matter and water. 

Many foods contain most of the constituents named 
above ; some few. such as sugar and oil, contain only one. 

The same chemical elements which are found in the body 
are found in the food which is necessary to growth and 
maintenance of life. The wise selection of food is based 
upon a consideration of its composition, its ease and com- 
pleteness of digestion, its cost, and palatability. 

CARBOHYDRATES 

The carbohydrates are the most important constituents of 
our foods in point of bulk. The well-known carbohydrates 
are sugars, starches, and cellulose. The carbohydrates are 
found in the plant kingdom with very few exceptions, such 
as lactose in milk and glycogen in the body. Starch occurs 
more abundantly in vegetables than in fruits, and sugar is 
found in both. A woody substance, cellulose, forms the 
framework of the plant. Cellulose because of its bulk is an 

444 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



aid in digestion. Starch and sugar are both valuable foods • 
they do not build the tissues of the body, but they furnish 
energy. Since plant foods are less expensive than animal 
foods, the carbohydrates are generally less expensive than 
proteins and fats. 

FATS 

There are many substances chemically related which are 
known as fats. Those which are licjuids at ordinary tem- 
peratures are called oils. Fats, like carbohydrates, yield 
energy and are frequently stored in considerable cjuantity in 
the body. Weight for weight, the fats yield two and a 
quarter times the energy that carbohydrates or proteins do. 
Fats are highly concentrated foods and are obtained from 
both plant and animal sources. The common animal 
sources are cream, butter, and fat of meat, and the common 
vegetable fats are olive oil, cottonseed oil, and the fat of 
nuts. Fat from most sources is expensive. 

PROTEINS 

The term "protein" includes a group of substances chemi- 
cally related, and all containing nitrogen. 

Some of the well-known members of the protein group 
are gluten of wheat, albumen of egg and meat, casein of 
milk, legumin of peas and beans. 

Protein is derived from both plant and animal sources. 
Some plant foods rich in protein are wheat, corn, oats, peas, 
beans, peanuts, lentils, and nuts. The animal sources of 
proteins are meat, milk, eggs, and cheese. Plant foods are 
cheaper than animal foods, and consequently they are a 
cheaper source of protein. 

Protein, like fat and carbohydrate, may serve as a source 
of energy to the body, but it differs from these in that it also 
builds tissue which is its chief office. 

Although protein is very necessary in the diet, it should 

445 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



not be eaten in too great quantities for its excessive use may 
overtax the organs of excretion. Heavy eating, and par- 
ticularly heavy eating of meat, may easily furnish more 
protein than is desirable. 

WATER 

Water furnishes the fluid necessary for the body and en- 
ters into the composition of all the tissues. Approximately 
two-thirds of the weight of the body is water, consequently 
the supply must be liberal. All foods contain water. Fruit 
green vegetables and milk are especially high in water con- 
tent, but the body needs more than occurs in the food, and 
water should be freely used as a beverage. 

MINERAL MATTER 

The body contains several pounds of mineral matter, the 
bulk of which is in the bones and teeth. Some mineral salts 
are in solution in the body fluids, and some are found in 
other body tissues. Mineral matter occurs in practically all 
our foods, both plant and animal, but it varies in amount 
and kind. While a freely chosen, normal diet may contain 
enough mineral matter to supply the demands of the body, 
it is not always in the form or amounts needed. Fruit and 
vegetables are especially valued for their mineral content. 
The outer coats of the cereal grains, so often discarded, are 
also rich in mineral matter. Care is necessary, especially 
with children, to provide foods supplying mineral. 

* Vitaniincs are certain newly discovered substances in very 
small amounts, which are believed to play an important part 
in keeping people well and in promoting the growth of child- 
ren. Without milk in the diet some of these substances, par- 
ticularly those necessary for children, would be lacking, and 
without meat, milk, eggs, fruits, and vegetables others 
needed by persons of all ages might not be present in suffi- 
cient amounts. 

(^Extract from Farmers' Bulletin No. 808, "How to Select Foods : 
What the Body Xeeds.") 

446 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Flavoring and condiments. In most families some ma- 
terials are used in preparing or serving food which add to 
the attractiveness of the meals without furnishing the body 
any nourishment. Among these are salt, pepper, vinegar, 
lemon juice, spices, seasoning herbs, horse-radish, flavoring 
extracts, and many other materials often spoken of as "con- 
diments." These are not discussed at length, because they 
are not absolutely needed by the body. They may, how- 
ever, be very useful in making an otherwise unattractive 
diet taste good. In fact, the secret of making inexpensive 
meals attractive lies largely in the skillful use of seasoning 
and flavors, and in this way they may be worth the cost 
they add to the diet even if they do not increase its actual 
food value. 

Any kind of food contains one or more of the substances 
just described, and they are combined in as many different 
ways as there are kinds of food. A satisfactory diet con- 
tains all of them and each in its proper proportion, and the 
problem of planning meals is, really that of choosing foods 
which will do this. 



Food Wastes. The relation between the cost of food and 
its actual value to supply bodily needs is affected by at least 
three different kinds of wastes. These dift'er greatly in 
different kinds of food. They are among the things which 
should be most carefully studied by the housewife. There 
is considerable loss between some kinds of foods as pur- 
chased and as cooked or served. Familiar examples are the 
shells of eggs, skins and seeds of fruit and vegetables, bones 
and offal of meat, and the like. These are commonly known 
as refuse. Some are of no value since they are wholly in- 
digestible ( for example egg shells ) . Others may be utilized 
in various ways, as meat bones, which may be used for soup 
stock. 

A second kind of waste is that caused by cooking. This 
is less important since, in most cases, it cannot be helped. 
But with some of the more expensive kinds of food, the 

447 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



choice among methods of cookery may be affected by the 
fact that some ways are more economical than others. 

A third waste is due to the fact that a part of the food 
actually eaten is not taken up into the lymph and blood 
channels, but passes through the digestive tract and is ex- 
creted from the body. This is not "available" to digestion. 

The products which finally reach the blood are called 
nutritive material or nutrients. 

DIGESTION, ASSIMILATION, AND EXCRETION* 

"We live not upon what we eat. but upon what we di- 
gest." Food as we buy it in the market, or even as we eat 
it, is not usually in condition to be made into body structure 
or used as body fuel. It must first go through a series of 
chemical changes by what is called digestion, which prepare 
it to be absorbed, taken into the blood and lymph, and car- 
ried to the parts of the body, where it is needed. Digestion 
takes place in the alimentary canal, partly in the stomach, 
but more in the intestine. As the result, the useless por- 
tions are separated and rejected, while the parts which can 
serve for nutriment are changed into forms in which they 
can be absorbed, taken into the circulation, and utilized. 

DIGESTION 

The alterations which tlie food undergoes in digestion are 
brought about by substances called ferments, which are 
secreted by the digestive organs. The saliva in the mouth 
has the power of changing insoluble starches into soluble 
sugar, but as the food stays in the mouth only a short time, 
there is generally little chance for such action. The saliva, 
however, helps to fit the food to be more easily worked on 
by the stomach. The gastric juice of the stomach acts upon 
protein, and the pancreatic juice in the intestine upon 
protein, fats, and carbohydrates. The action of all the fer- 
ments is aided by the fine division of the food by chewing

and the Nutritive \'alue of Foods." 

448

and by the mitscular contractions, the so-called peristaltic 
action, of the stomach and intestine. These latter motions 
help to mix the digestive juices and their ferments with the 
food. 

The parts of the food which the digestive juices can not 
dissolve, and which therefore escape digestion, are periodi- 
cally given off by the intestine. Such solid excreta, or 
feces, include not only the particles of undigested food, but 
also the so-called metabolic products, i. e., residues of the 
digestive juices, bits of the lining of the alimentary canal, 
etc. 

ABSORPTION AND ASSIMILATION 

The digested food finds its way through the walls of the 
alimentary canal, and at this time and later it undergoes 
remarkable chemical changes. When finally the blood, sup- 
plied with the nutrients of the digested food and freighted 
with oxygen from the lungs, is pumped from the heart all 
over the body it is ready to furnish the organs and tissues 
with the materials and energy which they need for their 
peculiar functions ; at the same time it carries away the 
waste which the exercise of these functions has produced. 
It is a characteristic of living tissue that it can choose the 
necessary materials from the blood and build them into its 
own structure. How it does this is one of the mysteries of 
physiology. The body, as we have learned, has also the 
power of consuming not only the materials of the food, but 
also parts of its own structure for the production of muscu- 
lar work, or heat, or to protect more important parts from 
consumption. How it does this is another mystery, still to 
be explained.

HOW TO SELECT FOODS^ 
Grouping Foods to Show Their Uses 

Perhaps as easy a way as any to select the right foods is 
to group the different kinds according to their uses in the 
body and then to make sure that all the groups are repre- 
sented regularly in the meals. Fortunately no more than 
five groups need be considered : ( 1 ) Fruits and vegetables ; 
( 2 ) meats and other protein-rich foods ; ( 3 ) cereals and 
other starchy foods; (4) sweets ; and (5) fatty foods. The 
materials under each of these heads have their special uses. 
It will be helpful, therefore, for the housekeeper to form the 
habit of thinking of the many different kinds of food which 
she handles as grouped in some such way as the following : 

Group 1. — Fruits and vegetables, such as apples, bananas, 
berries, citrus fruits, spinach and other greens, turnips, to- 
matoes, melons, cabbage, green beans, green peas, green 
corn, and many other vegetables and fruits. Without these 
the food would be lacking in mineral substances needed for 
building the body and keeping it in good working condition ; 
in acids which give flavor, prevent constipation, and serve 
other useful purposes ; and in minute cjuantities of other sub- 
stances needed for health. By giving bulk to the diet they 
make it more satisfying to the appetite. 

Group 2. — Meat and meat substitutes, or protein-rich 
foods : Moderately fat meats, milk, poultry, fish, cheese, 
eggs, dried legumes (beans, peas, lentils, cowpeas, peanuts), 
and some of the nuts. These are sources of an important 
body-building material, protein. In the case of children 
part of the protein food should always be whole milk. 

Group 3. — Foods rich in starch: Cereals (wheat, rice, 
rye, barley, oats, and corn) and potatoes (white and 
sweet). Cereals come near to being complete foods, and in 
most diets they supply more of the nourishment than anv 
other kind of food. It is not safe, however, to live only on 
cereals. The grains may be simply cleaned and partially

husked before cooking, as in cracked wheat and Scotch oat- 
meal ; they may be ground into flour and used as the basis 
of breads, cakes, pastry, etc. ; or they may be partially 
cooked at the factory, as in many breakfast preparations ; or 
they may be prepared in the form of such pastes as 
macaroni, noodles, etc. In all these forms they furnish the 
body with the same general materials, though in different 
proportions. 

Group 4. — Sugar (granulated, pulverized, brown, and 
maple), honey, molasses, syrup, and other sweets. Unless 
some of the fuel is in this form the diet is likely to be lack- 
ing in flavor. 

Group 5. — Foods very rich in fat : Bacon, salt pork, 
butter, oil, suet, lard, cream, etc. These are important 
sources of body fuel. \Mthout a little of them the food 
would not be rich enough to taste good. 

Some food materials really belong in more than one 
group. Cereals, for example, supply protein as well as 
starch ; potatoes supply starch as well as the mineral mat- 
ters, acids, cellulose, and body-regulating substances, for 
which they are especially valuable; and most meat supplies 
fat as well as protein. For the sake of simplicity, how- 
ever, each material is here grouped according to the nutrient 
for which it is usually considered most valuable. 

The lists given below show some of the common food 
materials arranged in these five groups. If the house- 
keeper will consult them in planning meals until she has 
learned where each kind of food belongs, she will have 
taken the first step toward providing a diet which will 
supply all the food needs of her family. It will be only one 
step, to be sure, but it should prevent two mistakes — that of 
serving meals that have not sufficient variety, and that of 

451

cutting down in the wrong places when economy either of 
time or money is needed : 

Group 1. — Foods depended on for mineral matters, 
vegetable acids, and body-regulating substances. 

Fruits Vegetables 

Apples, pears, etc. Salads — lettuce, celery.etc. 

Bananas Potherbs or "greens" 

Berries Potatoes and root veg- 

Melons etables 

Oranges, lemons, etc. Green peas, beans, etc.

Crackers vegetables

Molasses jellies, and dried fruits 

Sirups Sweet cakes and desserts

Candies 

Group 5. — Foods depended on for fat. 
Butter and cream Salt pork and bacon 

Lard, suet, and other Table and salad oils 
cooking fats 

452 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Thinking of foods according to the group to which they 
belong or according to the nutrient which they supply in 
largest amount will help the housekeeper to see whether 
in the meals she plans she has supplied all the different 
materials needed, especially whether there is the necessary, 
though small, amount of tissue-building mineral matters and 
body-regulating materials (group 1), and of tissue-building 
protein (group 2). When she has made sure that these are 
present, she may safely build up the bulk of the diet from 
whatever materials from the other groups seem economical, 
wholesome, and appetizing. By means of this grouping she 
will be reminded that meals consisting only of cereal mush 
(group 3) served with butter (group 5) and sirup (group 
4) would not be complete ration, and would almost surely 
be lacking in body-building material, because there are no 
foods from either group 1 (fruits and vegetables) or group 

2 (protein rich). It will become clear, also, that a school 
lunch of a kind far too frequently served, consisting of 
bread and cake, is lacking in the same way, and that a glass 
of milk (group 2) and an apple or an orange (group 1) 
would make it far more nearly complete. She will learn 
the wisdom of serving fruit (group 1) rather than a 
whipped cream dessert (group 5) or a suet pudding (groups 

3 and 5) after a course including a generous portion of fat 
meat (groups 2 and 5). 

The grouping will also help the housekeeper who wishes 
to save money or time to simplify her meals without making 
them one-sided or incomplete. For example, if she has 
been serving bread, potatoes, and rice or hominy in one 
meal, she will see that one or even two of them may be left 
out without omitting any important nutrient, providing a 
reasonable cjuantity of the one or two remaining is eaten. 
It will show her that a custard which is made of milk and 
eggs, two foods from group 2, would hardly be needed after 
a meal in which a liberal supply of meat had been served, 
provided one ate heartily of all, and that a child does not 
need milk at the same meal with an egg or meat. It will 

453 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



suggest that baked beans or other legumes, or thick soups 
made of legumes, are substitutes for meat rather than foods 
to be eaten with meat. 

This method of planning prevents substituting one food 
for another which has an entirely dififerent use. It prevents 
the housekeeper, for example, from trying to give a pleasant 
variety by using an extra amount of cakes or sweet desserts 
in the place of fruit and vegetables when the latter seem dif- 
ficult to obtain. Sugar is nutritious and has a valuable 
place in the diet, but the nourishment it furnishes is fuel and 
not the body-building and body-regulating materials which 
are found in fruits and vegetables, and it is not safe to cut 
them out, even if the meals can be made attractive without 
them. Fortunately, they are not always so hard to obtain as 
it seems, and the wise housekeeper will make every effort to 
supply them. In general, economy within each group is 
safer than using an inexpensive food from one group in 
place of an expensive one from another group. 

Thinking in terms of these groups will also help when 
laying in supplies. Dried peas and beans and dried fish, 
canned fish, and meat, and some kinds of cheese keep for a 
long time and can be used in place of fresh meat in an 
emergency. Fruits and vegetables put up when they are 
abundant will help to supply this important group in winter. 

Farm women can look even farther ahead, and often can 
plan to raise a variety of foods for use when it is difficult to 
buy at reasonable prices ; for example, enough beans to give 
the family a generous supply. Though navy beans have 
been most largely used in this country, there are many other 
good and easily grown kinds that can be chosen to give 
variety. In the South cowpeas should not be overlooked. 
If sugar is high in price honey can be produced, and home- 
made or purchased sorghum, maple, or cane sirup can be 
used. 

454 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



HOW TO TELL WHETHER OR NOT THE DIET IS 
ADEQUATE 

It is very hard for a housekeeper to know exactly how 
much of each of the food substances or nutrients her family 
needs or exactly how much of each set she is giving them. 
The exact amount which eacli person needs depends upon 
age, sex, size, and amount of work done with the muscles. 
An elderly person, or one of quiet habits, needs less food 
than a vigorous, young one ; a large person more than a 
small one ; a man more than a woman ; grown persons more 
than children ; and a farmer working in the hayfield, a 
mechanic, or a football player more than a man who sits at 
his desk all day. 

In order to calculate exacdy how much starch, sugar, fat, 
protein, etc. (or, what is equivalent to this, how much 
protein and energy ) the family needs one would have to 
know exactly how much muscular work each member was 
performing and also exactly how much of the different nu- 
trients each food contained and exactly how much each per- 
son would eat. This, of course, would mean a great deal of 
figuring. Fortunately, such exactness is not necessary in 
ordinary life. If a little too much or too little of one 
nutrient is provided at a single meal or on a single day a 
healthy body does not suffer, because it has ways of storing 
such a surplus and of using its stored material in an 
emergency. The danger would come if the diet taken 
week in and week out always provided too much or too little 
of some one nutrient. Against this danger the housekeeper 
can more easily protect her family. 

Habit and custom help greatly, because they usually are 
based on what the experience of generations has proved is 
wise and healthful, though, of course, there are bad habits 
and outgrown customs in food as in everything else. Good 
food habits, it must be remembered, include more than 
cleanliness and order in everything that has to do with food 
and meals and leisurely ways of eating. Equally important 
are a liking for all kinds of wholesome foods, even if they 

455 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



have not always been used in one's home or neighborhood, 
and eating reasonable amounts, without being either greedv 
or overdainty. Every effort should be made to train chil- 
dren in such good food habits. If older people have not 
learned them, they, too, should try to do so, for this is very 
important not only to health, but also to economy. To 
refuse to eat some wholesome dish simply because one is 
not accustomed to it may prevent the use of some very 
desirable and economical food. To feel that there is any 
virtue in providing more food than is needed shows poor 
taste as well as poor economy." 

It is a great help in planning food for the family group if 
the meals can be standardized. This standard will have to 
be determined for each family according to its activity and 
needs. If the adults are all sedentary, and have ample noon 
meals, breakfast may be very light or light, (see table below 
for suggestions). If, however, the workers take a light 
luncheon at noon, they should have a medium breakfast. If 
the family are engaged in active muscular exercise the 
breakfast should be heavy. 

In a similar way the other meals for the day may be 
planned.

The sedentary worker eating at a table with active work-

CHAPTER XXXIV 

FIRST AID 

It is better and easier to prevent disease than to cure it. 
Most of the sickness of today is preventable and due prim- 
arily to carelessness in living habits. Health depends upon 
strict adherence to a few simple rules. Plenty of fresh air, 
a sane and simple diet and regular exercise, combined with a 
care-free state of mind are the secrets of a nomal, healthy 
life. They are so simple that people overlook them. 

Every one knows that a doctor, as he has given years to 
studying the subject, is best qualified to care for the ill and 
injured, but accidents and sudden illness often occur where 
the services of a physician cannot be immediately obtained. 
The necessary delay may cause serious results. Everv one 
should know the principles of first aid, for it is a valuable 
form of insurance. 

Knowledge of first aid enables one to put the patient into 
the doctor's hands in the best possible condition, and also to 
recognize the severity of an injury so that prompt treatment 
may follow. 

Treatment except for minor cases of injury or illness and 
care of the injured is not first aid and should not be prac- 
ticed without consulting a physician. 

Prevention is better than cure in injury as well as disease 
and it is the duty of every person to practice every precau- 
tion for preventing accident. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

In case of injury keep all persons away from the patient 
except those required to help. Give the patient plentv of 
air. Be calm and do not be hurried. In giving first aid it 
is as necessary to know what not to do as what to do. It is 

458 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



usually best to send for a doctor immediately and let him 
care for the injury from the first, but it would be foolish 
to wait for a doctor if there were danger of death from 
bleeding. 

Remember that if there is any doubt in your mind as to 
the severity of the injury it is best to consult a doctor for in- 
juries which apparently are trivial may sometimes, if not 
promptly treated, cause serious results. 

Loosen any tight clothing and get the patient into a com- 
fortable position, usually on the back with the head low. 
With a flushed face the head may be raised on a small pil- 
low, with a pale face, it should not the raised at all. 

Unconscious persons cannot swallow and so should not 
be given water, stimulant, etc., as these will choke them by 
entering the wind pipe. 

Before moving a person from the place where his accident 
occurs be sure that he is not going to be injured further by 
moving. 

Cold water may be given with safety. Stimulants are 
often given, but are not necessary for every case and should 
never be given in injuries of the head. Use aromatic spirits 
of ammonia as a stimulant in preference to any alcoholic 
liquor. Small quantities of liquor act as a stimulant, large 
ones are depressing. 

In cases of injury it is generally necessary to remove 
clothing. This is likely to be painful and should be done as 
carefully as possible. Rip up seams of outside clothing and 
cut or tear underclothing. 

When there are several injuries the most severe should be 
cared for first. . 

SHOCK 

More or less shock is caused by all injuries and should be 
treated if necessary. "Shock is more or less profound de- 
pression of the nervous system." Symptoms of shock — 
face is pale, eyelids droop, eyes are dull and pupils are large, 
the skin is cold and moist. The injured person is more or 

459 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



less stupid and may be partly or totally unconscious, breath- 
ing is feeble, pulse is rapid and weak. 

Warm and stimulate the person in every way before the 
arrival of the doctor. Place patient on back with head lov,'. 
Give hot coffee or tea or half a teaspoonful of aromatic 
spirits of ammonia in half a glass of water. Keep the 
patient warm, place hot water bottles around him, rub his 
arms and legs to quicken the circulation. 

The symptoms of severe bleeding are very like shock and 
if shock only is treated in such a case and the bleeding is 
not checked serious results may follow. 

Bandages — The triangular bandage is best suited for gen- 
eral first aid. as it can be easily made and applied and is not 
likely to be put on too tightly. The bandage is made from 
cloth about one yard square, is folded diagonally and cut 
across the fold, making two bandages. 

It may be applied unfolded or folded. To fold — the 
point of the triangle is brought to the middle of the opposite 
side and the bandage is folded lengthwise to the desired 
width. 

Triangular bandages are usually fastened by tying the 
ends securely or they may be pinned with small safety pins. 
Knots should be placed where they do not cause discomfort. 

Care must be taken that the bandage is not put on too 
tightly, but it should be put on firmly. 

In bandaging a limb, leave the tips of fingers or of the 
toes uncovered. Place part to be bandaged in the position 
in which it is to be left, as change of position may result in 
cutting ofif circulation by drawing the bandage too tight. 

TREATMENT FOR STRAINS 

Strains are caused by overstretching the muscles, blood 
vessels in the muscles may be broken so that blood escapes 
into the muscles in the same way that with a bruise blood 
escapes into the subcutaneous tissue. 

Alcohol and water, witch-hazel or arnica may be rubbed 
on to deaden the pain. 

460 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



TREATMENT FOR SPRAINS 

"Sprains result from stretching, twisting, and partial 
breaking of the ligaments about a joint." 

For severe sprains call a doctor; keep the patient quiet, 
elevate the injured joint and apply cloths wrung out in hot 
water. For hot applications have two or three towels in 
service. While one is applied to the wound, the other is 
made ready; the removal of the one being followed immedi- 
ately by the application of the other. In this way the hot 
water is kept on the bruised parts continuously, giving the 
best results. 

The next step is absolute rest. The part should be band- 
aged in such a way that it is kept absolutely quiet. Fre- 
quent bathing with tincture of arnica, or witch-hazel, will 
assist in reducing the swelling and promoting absorption. 

FRACTURE 

Send for a doctor and treat for shock. Keep the patient 
quiet so that there will be no danger of the sharp edges of 
the broken bone puncturing the skin. If the patient must 
be moved a little to make him comfortable, the broken bone 
should be firmly supported by the hands, placing the hands 
on each side of the break so that the bone w411 not bend. 

WOUNDS 

Wounds are injuries in which the skin is broken. The 
outside layer of the skin protects the body from the en- 
trance of pus germs, the small parasites which cause in- 
flammation, matter or pus and blood poisoning. 

Pus germs are found on the surface of our bodies on 
knives and other objects which cause wounds, in the dust of 
houses, in water, etc., but they do not float about in the air. 
There is no danger from them in exposing a wound to the 
air. 

If pus germs do not enter a wound, there is no inflamma- 
tion and it will heal quickly, but if the wound is infected by 

461 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



pus germs inflammation will follow, more or less matter will 
form and blood poison even may result. If only a few pus 
germs are carried into the body certain cells will dispose of 
the germs and no harm will result, while the blood from the 
injury will often wash out the germs and the cells and dis- 
pose of those that are left. Therefore a wound which bleeds 
freely is not likely to prove so dangerous. 

Every precaution must be taken to keep the wound and 
everything which comes in contact with it in an antiseptic 
condition. 

KINDS OF WOUNDS 

There are three varieties of wounds, — the cut wound, 
made by a sharp instrument, the skin and tissues are cleanly 
divided and there is likely to be severe bleeeding. 

Torn wound in which the tissues are torn as from the 
blow of a blunt instrument. Dirt is apt to be ground into 
the tissues and inflammation may follow. 

Punctured wounds are deep small wounds as from a 
bayonet or bullet. Infection is common as pus germs may 
increase rapidly in them. 

Send for a doctor and treat for shock. Do not allow 
clothing to touch the wound ; exposure to the air is much 
safer than the application of anything which is not surgically 
clean. If you have an antiseptic dressing, apply it at once. 

Water contains pus germs and so should not be used. 
Strong antiseptics as carbolic acid will destroy the cells of 
the tissues, peroxide is not strong enough to kill germs and 
may wash them into unaffected parts. Therefore do not 
use these but cover the wound to keep out pus germs. 

For slight cuts or scratches, peroxide may be used before 
dressing — do not use plaster as this seals in any germs that 
are present. 

If the head be injured, the patient should lie down with 
the head resting upon a pillow or cushion covered with a 
clean towel, taking care that the injured part be kept from 
contact with surrounding articles. 

462 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



If the arm l)e injured, it should, as a rule, be brought 
across in front of the chest and supported in a sling. 

H the lower limb be wounded, it may be supported in a 
comfortable portion by resting upon a cushion or blanket. 

In wounds of the chest, the head and shoulders should be 
raised by one or more pillows until the patient is able to 
breathe comfortably. 

If the abdomen be wounded, the patient should be made 
to lie down, with his knees drawn up, and turned over 
toward the uninjured side ; or upon the back if the wound be 
in front. 

Before dressing the wound the nails should be thor- 
oughly cleansed with a brush and rings removed from the 
fingers. After cleansing the hands, do not touch anything 
not al)Solutely clean. 

BLEEDING 

To stop a hemorrhage, it is necessary to know that 
blood comes from two sources, arteries and veins. It must 
also be remembered that blood in an artery comes from 
the heart, and that blood in a vein is on its way to the 
heart. Thus, in stopping the l)leeding from an artery, pres- 
sure must be made between the heart and the wound, while 
in bleeding from a vein pressure must be made on the 
distant side of the wound. 

It is not difficult to determine whether the bleeding is 
from an artery or a vein, as in an artery the blood spurts 
and pulsates, while blood from a vein oozes and flows with- 
out pulsation in a steady stream. 

Bleeding from an artery, especially one of considerable 
size, is very serious, and prompt efforts must be made to 
stop it. 

Genteral Rules eor Treatment 
Send for a physician immediately. Have the injured 
person lie down and elevate the wounded part. This can 
be done readily if an arm or leg is affected. Remove cloth- 
ing from the affected part — it may be necessary to cut it 

463 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



off. Keep the patient as quiet as possible. Apply pressure 
directly upon the bleeding point by pressing the finger, 
covered with gauze, upon it. H the bleeding is fro.n an 
artery, make pressure above the wound, that is, between 
it and the heart. This can be done with an elastic band or 
tightly wound bandages. 

In severe cases a tourniquet must be used. This can be 
made by first strapping the limb with a bandage, making a 
knot in it, which should be placed at a point above the wound 
directly over the artery supplying the bleeding point. The 
artery can be located with the index finger, as its pulsa- 
tions can be detected. When the knot is made, a loop 
should be also directly over it, through which a small stick 
can be placed. This can be twisted, and thus pressure is 
brought to bear upon "the artery until the bleeding ceases. 
The bleeding point must be watched in the event that the 
flow may recur. Such a tourniquet must not be left on the 
arm or leg for too long a time. In minor wounds the bleed- 
ing will be arrested in 15 to 20 minutes, when the pressure 
can be reduced. In severe cases of bleeding, apply cold by 
means of ice bandages; in ordinary bleeding pressure by 
means of gauze upon the wound is sufficient to stop it. 

In excessive bleeding, general treatment of the patient 
is necessarv. The patient may faint or become very weak. 
In the latter case heat should be applied to the extremities 
and the patient kept warm by wrapping in blankets. 

NOSEBLEED 

Place patient in a chair with his head hanging back. 
Place a cloth wrung in cold water at the back of the neck. 
Use one teaspoonful salt to one cupful water and snuff this 
liquid up the nose. Packing the nose with gauze usually is 
effective in severe cases. If bleeding continues, summon a 
physician.

BURNS 

Reddening of skin. Exclude the air by applying thin 
paste of water and a liberal amount of baking soda. Apply 
any oil, such as olive oil, sweet oil, fresh lard, unsalted 
butter, vaseline, etc. One of the best oils to use is a solution 
of equal parts of linseed oil and limew^ater. One of these 
substances should be smeared on a cloth to cover the burn. 

Cover the wound with cotton or some soft material. If 
the wound is wet, always see to it that oil has been used 
freely before using cotton, as when dry the latter will stick 
and reopen the burned surface when an attempt is made to 
remove it. 

Burns caused by acids should be thoroughly washed with 
water, then with a solution of baking soda and water, and 
then treated like an ordinary burn. 

Burns caused by alkalies, such as caustic potash, caustic 
soda, or ammonia, should be washed with vinegar or some 
other dilute acid, when blisters have formed treat as for 
other burns but if the blistering is extensive it is best to show 
the injury to a doctor. 

For severe burns. — These recjuire the prompt attention 
oi a [)h}'sician. h'irst remove the clothing by cutting it 
av.ay with a pair of scissors. If it sticks, do not pull it off, 
buit saturate it with oil. 

Cover severe burns as ijuicklv as possible, so as to 
exclude the air. An application should be ready to apply 
immediately. 

The bicarbonate of soda and oils are best applied by 
dipping cloths into them, ointments by spreading on cloths 
and then applying. 

In burns of the mouth or throat, apply the oil or white of 
an tgg by drinking them. If caused by chemicals, the 
mouth and throat should be rinsed by the proper antidote 
— vinegar or dilute acid in case of caustic soda, potash, 
ammonia, or lye, and a solution of baking soda for acid 
burns.

THE H O U S E K E E P E i< 



A person whose clothing is burning should be made to 
lie down — if necessary, thrown down — as the tendency of 
the flames is to rise upward. When the patient is lying dow'n 
the flames have less to feed on. and there is not so much 
danger of their reaching the face or of the patient inhaling 
the fumes. The person should be quickly wrapped in a 
shawl or blanket and the fire smothered by pressing on the 
burning part. 

SUNSTROKE 

The attack is usually preceded by giddiness, weakness, 
and nausea; eyes bloodshot and contracted; skin hot and 
dry ; subject unconscious, breathing quick and loud ; heart 
rapid and tumultuous. 

Treatment 

Place the patient on his back in a cool place with the 
head raised. The chief object is to reduce the excessive 
heat. Bags of cracked ice may be applied to the head and 
under armpits. The patient should be wrapped in cold 
sheets or placed in a tub containing cold water. Continue 
until patient is conscious or the heat greatly diminished. 

If this is done the patient must be rubbed continually to 
prevent shock and to bring blood to the surface. When 
consciousness returns the patient may be allowed to drink 
cold water freely. 

FAINTING 

Due to lack of blood to the brain. Caused by weakness as 
in recovering from illness, some people faint easily. 

Treatment 

Lay the patient on his back. If the face is white and 
bloodless, have his head low^er than his body. Let him have 
plenty of fresh air. Loosen the clothing. Apply cold water 
to the face. This in most cases will bring a return to 
consciousness. Aromatic spirits of ammonia is a good 

466 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



thing to use as a smelling salts and to give internally when 
consciousness returns. 

The above treatment is applicable in all cases of simple 
tainting due to weakness, mental emotions, and close, warm 
atmosphere of crowds. 

In the event of fainting from shock following an accident, 
there may be more marked symptoms, such as coldness of 
the skin, dilation of the pupils, and weak heart action. 

In addition to the above treatment, the skin should be 
rubbed briskly and bleeding, if any, controlled, 

DROWNING 

Loosen the clothing. Empty lungs of water by laymg the 
body on its stomach and lifting it by the middle so that 
the head hangs down for a few seconds. Do not waste time 
before beginning artificial respiration. 

The Shaefer method is called the " prone pressure 
method " because the patient lies at full length face down, 
and pressure is made with the hands of the operator on the 
back over the lower ribs and then the pressure is relaxed. 
This is continued alternately about twelve times a minute. 
Thus the air is forced out and sucked in, making a frecjuent 
exchange of air in the lungs. The advantages mentioned 
for this method are that it is exceedingly simple, can be 
done by one person and without fatigue, and that because 
of the position of the patient allows the tongue to fall for- 
ward and the mucus and the water to escape from the mouth 
and thus not block up the throat. The patient's head may be 
turned slightly to one side so that the ground will not block 
the air from the nose and mouth. When breathing begins, 
get the patient into a warm bed, give warm drinks in tea- 
spoonfuls. Keep the patient very quiet. 

POISONING 

Delay is hkely to prove fatal in cases of poisoning so 
whatever is done must be done promptly. Send for a doctor 
at once. An emetic is not the best treatment in every case, 

467 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



but it should always be given if you do not know what 
poison has been taken or the proper antidote. 

Running the finger down the throat or drinking a large 
quantity of warm water will usually cause vomiting. 

(1) Eliminate the poison from the stomach; (2) neutral- 
ize the poison b)^ giving an antidote; (3) treat the general 
symptoms produced by the poison. 

The material is eliminated by being vomited. Vomiting 
can be induced in the following ways; use mustard and 
warm water, beginning with a glassful and repeating if 
necessary. If you have ipecac in the house — and it is a good 
thing to have — give about a teaspoonful of syrup of ipecac 
to a child or a tablespoonful to a grown person every few 
minutes until vomiting results. 

Antidotes 

In nearly all cases of poisoning, olive oil, if available can 
be given in large doses, namely, a pint or more, as it 
neutralizes most poisons except phosphorus. This can be 
followed by the whites of two eggs. When in doubt, use 
the oil followed by the eggs. 

In giving antidotes, two general principles should be 
observed : namely, that acids tend to neutralize alkalies and 
alkalies neutrahze acids. 

For poisoning from acids, such as muriatic, oxalis, acetic, 
sulphuric (oil of vitriol), nitric, or tartaric, use soapsuds, 
magnesia, limewater, whiting, plaster scraped from the 
wall, milk, oil, and baking soda. Give large cjuantities of 
oil. 

For poisoning from alkalies, such as ammonia, potash, or 
soda, use acids as an antidote, such as vinegar, lemon juice, 
and orange juice, follow'ed by large doses of olive oil, castor 
oil, and emetics. 

Another group of poisons are the narcotics. In this class 
are chloroform, chloral, ether, and the opium preparations, 
such as opium, morphine, laudanum, paregoric and sooth- 
ing syrups. Provide plenty of fresh air, induce artificial 

468 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



breathing, apply ammonia to nostrils, give cathartics and 
stimulants, such as coffee, brandy, and strychnine. Compel 
the patient to move about. If unconscious, keep the head 
low. 

CARBOLIC ACID 

Rinse mouth with alcohol, give 3 tablespoonfuls in equal 
measure of water to adult. Follow in five minutes with two 
tablespoonfuls Epsom Salts. Give oil or eggs. Keep patient 
warm and stimulated. 

ALCOHOL (TREATMENT) 

Keep the patient active by pinching, slapping with wet 
towel, or hot and cold douches to head; give plenty of strong 
coft'ee ; inhale ammonia cautiously, and use artificial respira- 
tion if unconscious. 

INSECT BITES 

For mosquito bites, stings from gnats, wasps, bees, and 
spiders, washing with dilute with ammonia is the best treat- 
ment. Oil may follow, or the parts may be washed in salt 
water. Baking soda dissolved in warm water is also good. 
The sting should be removed. 

SNAKE BITE 

When bitten by a snake first prevent the poison from get- 
ting into the general circulation. This can be done by 
immediately sucking the wound. Precaution must be used 
in seeing that the mouth is not sore or the poison swallowed. 
Shut oft" the circulation from the part by bandaging the 
limb — if such it be — tightly, or if in another part, by pres- 
sure over the vein. Squeeze the poison out and wash with 
warm water. If ammonia can be had, burn out the wound 
with it. Keep the bandage on several hours, and when re- 
leasing it do so gradually. 

469 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Whiskey is recommended as a stimulant or give a large 
drink of aromatic spirits of ammonia at once and repeat as 
often as seems necessary to keep up the strength. Do not be 
afraid to give too much, for persons bitten by poisonous 
snakes require a large amount of stimulants. 

NAUSEA AND VOMITING 

These are generally due to indigestible food but may be 
caused by nervousness. 

A soda mint tablet or baking soda in water will usually 
stop nausea. When due to indigestible food, several drinks 
of lukewarm water will usually cause vomiting and will 
wash out the stomach. Patient should lie down — apply hot 
cloths to abdomen.

PREPARATION OF THE SICK ROOM 

Generally speaking the patient's own room is best as he 
is apt to be more contented there. 

470 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Tlie room selected however should not be on the ground 
floor as such a room is likely to be noisy. A toilet nearby 
will save steps in serious illness and will be safer in cases 
of contagiovis disease. 

The room should be well ventilated and all unnecessary 
furnishings should be removed. 

A narrow, high bed is to be preferred as it is much easier 
for a nurse to lift a helpless patient when she does not have 
to bend very low. If obliged to use a double bed, try to 
have the patient sleep on one side during the day, leaving the 
other side comfortable for night. 

The lower sheet should be smooth and kept in place by 
safety pins at the corners of the mattress. Over this a draw 
sheet should be placed. This is a sheet folded and placed 
across the bed so that it extends from the patient's back to 
his knees. It should be pinned in place to the mattress. The 
top covering should consist of a sheet and double blanket 
with the sheet well turned back. Extra sheets and pillow 
cases should be ready. It is well also to have hot water 
bottles ready for use.

CHAPTER XXXV 

PERSONAL HYGIENE 
THE SKIN 

The human skin has two principal functions : to protect 
the body, and to remove, by perspiration, the results of cer- 
tain bodily changes. 

The surface of the skin, the part which raises over a 
blister is the epidermis. The permanent color of the skin 
is due to certain pigment granules found in the deeper 
layers of the epidermis. The transient red color, as in 
blushing, depends upon the amount of blood in the blood 
vessels and the thickness of the epidermis or outer skin, 
most of the blood vessels themselves lying in the inner skin. 

Beneath the epidermis is the " true skin " which gives 
the skin its peculiar lines and marks. The true skin is per- 
forated by blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves; it affords 
lodgment to hair roots and gives passages to the ducts of the 
sweat glands and oil-glands. The third layer of the skin 
is the connective tissue which contains fat, arteries, veins 
and lymphatics. This fatty layer gives the skin its smooth- 
ness and acts as a protective covering for the body. 

The skin contains sweat glands w^hich secrete perspira- 
tion, and sebaceous glands, which secrete a fatty substance 
that tends to keep the skin smooth and to prevent it from 
drying by too great evaporation. This fatty substance also 
gives the hair its natural gloss. Obstruction of the sweat 
glands gives rise to pimples, black-heads and the like. 

It is well known that the skin becomes soft by immer- 
sion in a hot bath or by having the hands for a considerable 
time in suds and that this softening extends to the nails and 

473 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



calluses. After a warm bath a considerable cjuantity of the 
horny scales of the skin can be removed by the use of a 
rough towel. Nails, corns, and the like when wet can be 
readily cut or scraped ofif. A considerable amount of water 
remains in the skin after bathing, and unless care is exer- 
cised it tends by rapid evaporation to remove heat and cause 
colds. But normally a certain amount of water should 
remain in the skin, and if too much of this evaporates, the 
skin chaps and cracks. 

There is a direct and reciprocal action between the con- 
dition of the skin and the general bodily health. The two 
watchwords in the preservation or improvement of the com- 
plexion are, therefore, cleanliness and hygiene. Plenty of 
outdoor exercise, good ventilation, a well-regulated appetite, 
and a cheerful habit of mind are essential. As to diet, an 
excess of butter, fat meat, and greasy food should be given 
up or used with great moderation. Fruit and vegetables 
should be the staples of diet; sweets, cake, and pastry, and 
acid foods should be dispensed with. 

Hardening the Skin. — The power of the skin to adjust 
itself to changes in temperature varies greatly. It can be 
increased by measures which improve the circulation of the 
blood, as nourishment and exercise ; also by what is some- 
times called the " hardening" process." The skin may be 
hardened by living an out-of-door life, wearing light but 
sufficient clothing, sleeping with open windows but avoid- 
ing draughts, and taking daily baths, first with warm, after- 
wards with cold water. These steps should be taken grad- 
ually, and increased in severity as the body becomes accus- 
tomed to them. 

Nervous persons, especially children, may be overstimu- 
lated by these measures, which may thus lead to nervous 
difficulties. The danger is minimized by giving the warm 
bath first. Cold baths alone should not be taken except by 
persons of strong constitution. 

The human skin contains millions of pores. The business 
of these pores is to bring to the surface the waste materials 



474 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



of the body, which otherwise pass off principally through the 
kidneys. 

Colds are often caused by lack of proper contraction of 
the pores of the skin when the body is exposed from 
draughts or otherwise. As a result the blood is cooled too 
rapidly and has a tendency to chill and congest the internal 
organs, as the mucuous surfaces of the head and nose, and 
also of the alimentary canal, the kidneys, etc. The resulting 
symptoms show in acute form the bad effects of neglect of 
bathing. In fact, frequent bathing is a good preventive of 
colds. If the pores are kept clean they are active, and resist 
the chills which tend to produce cold. 

Certain portions of the body, as the armpits and feet have 
many more pores to the square inch than the rest; hence 
these perspire more freely and should be cleansed often. A 
clean person, clean clothing, a clean house, clean premises, 
clean streets, a clean town, are so many forms of the habit 
of cleanliness which is one of the characteristics of high 
civilization, one of the fundamental elements of self-respect 
and proper living. The principal hygienic purpose of bath- 
ing may be stated as cleanliness. 

Temperature of the Bath. — The temperature of the bath 
for cleanliness should be about 95° Fahrenheit. A cold 
shower bath to follow the warm bath should be about 77° 
Fahrenheit. A cool bath should be about 77° Fahrenheit, 
but the temperature at the start may be lowered for those 
who are accustomed to it. 

The water for a person in ordinary health should be 
drawn as hot as is agreeable ; but care should be taken not to 
remain too long in a hot bath. This applies especially to 
persons who are thin-blooded, nervous, or neuralgic. After 
the body has been thoroughly cleansed, it is a good idea 
to gradually introduce cold water into the tub until a 
perceptible chill is felt. The shower bath is the best means 
of cooling the body after a hot bath. When this is done, 

475 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



or after a cold bath, a reaction should be brought about by a 
vigorous rubbing with a Turkish towel until the body is in a 
warm glow. 

Cold Sponge Bath. — Many persons make a practice of 
taking a cold sponge bath every morning, followed by 
vigorous rubbing with a coarse towel or flesh brush. The 
best method of doing this is to fill a washbowl or basin 
with water and let it stand in the room over night, so as to 
acquire the same temperature as the air in the room. Rub 
with the bare hands rather than with a cloth or sponge, 
wetting only a small portion of the body at a time and rub- 
bing that portion until a reaction is experienced. 

After the rub-down with a coarse towel, the skin should 
be pink, all in a tingle, and the whole surface of the body 
should be in a warm glow. Some persons cannot endure this 
regime, although it is highly beneficial to others. A few 
days or weeks of experience will test its expediency. This 
is worth trying because it often results in a life habit which 
is exceedingly beneficial. Those who are less robust may 
obtain some of the benefits of the cold sponge bath by a 
vigorous rubbing with a towel or flesh brush each morning 
when the bath is not taken. When bathing in winter, the 
shock from cold water is lessened by standing a minute in 
the cold air after removing the clothing and before applying 
the water. 

When one takes vigorous daily exercise the best time for 
the bath is immediately after the exercise. One is then per- 
spiring and it is best to change the clothing. The skin is 
most readily cleaned in this condition, and most persons find 
a hot bath, with or without the use of soap, followed by a 
short, cold needle bath, shower, or plunge, preferable to 
other forms of bathing. 

. . Salt Water Bath. — Add sea salt, which can be purchased 
of any druggist, to a full bath at a temperature of 65° 
Fahrenheit. The patient should remain in this bath from 
ten to twentv minutes, and afterwards should rest for half 



476 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



an hour in a recumbent position. Such baths are useful in 
general debility produced by diseases. 

The Complexion, — The object of attention to the com- 
plexion should be to preserve the skin in its normal condition 
of health, and to remove all abnormal effects and conditions. 
Among these may be mentioned excessive dryness or evap- 
oration, by exposure to dry and biting winds, of the water 
normall}^ contained in the skin ; the opposite extreme of 
excessive perspiration; and the oljstruction of the pores by 
dirt or grime or other causes. 

Many persons regard attention to these matters as 
evidence of vanity and light-headedness, and others go to 
the opposite extreme and give much more time and thought 
to the niceties of the toilet than is either wise or necessary. 
Doubtless the wise and sane course lies between the two 
extremes. The normal condition of the skin resulting in a 
firm, smooth, and soft texture and a pink-and-white com- 
plexion, not only contributes to personal attractiveness, but 
also to the sense of comfort, included in the general term 
" good health." 

Every one has a natural right to a good complexion. The 
contrary is evidence of some improper or diseased condition, 
and it is perfectly natural and proper to seek and apply 
suitable remedies. 

Many of the standard preparations widely advertised for 
sale contain the most injurious mineral drugs, such, for 
example, as mercury arsenic, lead bismuth, etc. These are 
freely used by many " beauty doctors," and most unfortu- 
nately recipes containing them have been published without 
caution. All such preparations have been carefully excluded 
from this volume. Approved recipes have been given which 
will accomplish every desirable object without the possibility 
of injurious consequences. 

To preserve the Complexion. — To prevent the excessive 
evaporation of water normally present in the skin, it is well 
to rub a small quantity of cold cream over the face before 

477 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



going out in the hot sun or wind. Just enough should be 
used to cover the surface without its being noticeable. In 
hot climates the use of similar preparations to prevent the 
drying of the skin is practically universal. 

To zvash the face. — When the face is red or dry from ex- 
posure to sun and air, or grimed with dirt and smoke, it is 
well to put on it a quantity of cold cream and rub thoroughly 
with a soft cloth. After the irritation has been somewhat 
lessened, the face should be thoroughly washed and cleansed. 
Fill a basin two-thirds full of fresh soft water. If your 
source of water supply is hard water, put a teaspoonful of 
powdered borax into the basin. Dip the face in the water, 
and afterwards the hands. Soap the hands well, and rub 
with a gentle motion over the face. Dip the face a second 
time, rinse thoroughly, and wipe with a thick, soft towel. 
After the bath a slightly astringent lotion is very refreshing. 

The use of a good cleansing cream before the face bath 
and a suitable lotion afterwards has a really wonderful effect 
in improving the complexion. The effect of a clean face, 
however, is itself altogether delightful. Such a bath tends 
to rest and refresh the bather. Many a bad complexion is 
due to neglect of a proper cleansing process. If more faces 
were kept really clean, a great improvement in the com- 
plexion would be noticed. 

Face Cloth. — The hands themselves, in the judgment of 
many persons, are the most effective means of washing other 
portions of the body. To those who prefer face cloths we 
suggest scrim as the most sanitary material. Scrim is 
porous and free from lint, so that the air circulates through 
it freely. It is so thin that it can be quickly washed and 
dried. 

BLACKHEADS 

The sebaceous glands supply an oily substance which 
keeps the skin soft and pliable and serves as a natural oil 
for the hair. When the duct of a sebaceous gland becomes 

478 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



obstructed with dust and dirt, such as covers even the clean- 
est looking skin, a black head is formed. Enlarged pores 
are dilated or inactive se1)acous glands. When these black- 
heads are numerous they become very unsightly. 

To correct pimples and blackheads, — each second night 
bathe the face with hot water containing one tablespoonful 
of boric acid. This tlushes the skin with fresh blood and 
softens the caps of pimples and the hardened contents of the 
blackheads. Gently scjueeze the pimple or blackhead with 
the fingers covered with a clean cloth. Dry the face thor- 
oughly and rub in about each pimple a very little of one- 
half of one per cent, ammoniated mercury ointment on the 
finger tip. If the skin is very tender the U. S. P. boric acid 
ointment may be used instead of ammoniated mercury oint- 
ment which sometimes irritates. 

FRECKLES 

Freckles are discolorations formed in the deeper layers 
of the skin by the action of sunlight. Hence to affect them 
directly it is necessary to work through the outer layers of 
the skin with a remedy that will change the deposits of 
coloring matter. Freckles, accordingly, offer great resist- 
ance and are not amenable to ordinary treatment. 

As a preventive, attention should be paid to diet and exer- 
cise to promote the normal secretions. The skin should be 
kept scrupulously clean by daily bathing, and the activity of 
the pores should be promoted by friction with a coarse 
towel. These methods are safer than the use of astringents 
or mineral emulsions, and the latter should never be 
employed without the advice of a competent physician. The 
only certain preventive is the wearing of a veil whenever 
the complexion is exposed to sunlight. 

MOTH PATCHES 

Apply a solution of common baking soda to the patches 
with a soft cloth several times a day for two or three days. 
Allow this to dry on. This treatment is usually sufficient. 

479 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Afterwards cleanse the face with a bran bath and the skin 
will usually be found clear and brilliant. 

Or keep alum at hand and rub occasionally on the moth 
patches. This will usually cause them to disappear. 

SUPERFLUOUS HAIRS 

The natural causes of excessive growth of hair are ob- 
scure. There is but one dependable agent for destroying 
hair, and that is the electric needle. The needle is tedious, 
expensive, but efficient and comparatively painless. It 
should be applied only by a physician. The X-ray is some- 
times used with success where a large number of hairs are 
to be destroyed. 

Hairs may be made less noticeable by bleaching with 
peroxide and ammonia (3 pans peroxide to 1 of weak am- 
monia water). A good many alleged " complexion beauti- 
fiers "' appear to stimulate hair growth. 

There seems to be no harm in shaving the hairs under 
the arms or removing them by chemical depilatories, pro- 
■v'ided the chemical does not inflame the skin as many depi- 
latories do. But no chemical will permanently destroy hair. 

Toilet Soaps. — There are two principal kinds of soap; 
those containing free alkali in the form of soda lye, and the 
so-called neutral or fatty soaps. The former increase the 
swelling and softening of the horny parts of the skin. When 
these are removed they of course take the dirt with them. 
The latter are better adapted to persons of sensitive skin, 
although their detergent eiTects are not so marked. Among 
these are castile and glycerine soaps. 

Purchase for household use only well-known soaps which 
have an established reputation for purity. Toilet prepara- 
tions which may have good effects on one skin are some- 
times injurious to another. This shows hom important it is 
for a woman to know what ingredients are used in making 
up her toilet preparations. It is not always safe to " try " 

480 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



some compound because it is highly recommended by others. 
No preparation can give satisfactory results in the absence 
of absolute cleanliness. 

CARE OF THE HANDS 

Nothing betrays lack of daintiness in personal care more 
than neglect of the hands and nails. Of course it is more 
difficult for some women to keep their nails clean and their 
hands soft, white, and free from blemishes than for others. 
The hands should not be washed except when it can be done 
thoroughly. Constantly rinsing them in cold w^ater grinds 
the dirt in and ruins the texture of the skin, making it rough, 
coarse and red. When exposed to hard usage, as in the 
routine of housework, instead of frequently washing the 
hands in water, a few drops of oil should be rubbed into 
them. They should then be dusted over with talcum powder 
and wiped with a coarse towel. This will cleanse them and 
protect the flesh from growing callous. Lemon juice will 
remove stains. 

The hands should always be washed with tepid water 
and a good soap. Avoid washing the hands frecpiently 
with cheap laundry soap, washing powders, soft soap, or 
other powerful detergents. They tend to roughen, redden, 
and chap the skin. The best soap is none too good for the 
toilet. Any hard, white, pure, or neutral soap is suitable 
for the toilet.. Hence it is not necessary to purchase special 
toilet soaps, which are usually expensive, however desirable 
they may seem to be. 

To remove stubborn stains. — Mix oxalic acid and cream 
of tartar in equal proportions, and keep the mixture in a 
box with the other toilet articles. This box should be 
marked " Poison " and kept out of the reach of children. 
Wet the stain with warm water and sprinkle with this 
preparation rubbing until the stain disappears. Then wash the 
hands with soap and rinse well. This will remove the most 
stubborn ink and dye stains. 

481 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



To Soften the Hands. — Keep on hand a dish of oatmeal, 
and rub it freely on the hands after washing. This will 
cleanse and soften the skin. 

Or use corn meal in the same manner. 

In cold weather or when the hands are very dirty rub a 
little cold cream over them, and afterwards wash them with 
soap and water in the usual way. This has a tendency to 
keep the skin from cracking or chapping. The use of gloves, 
especially when gardening, driving or walking in sun or 
wind, helps to preserve the softness of the hands and keep 
them clean. Sprinkling the hands with orris root or talcum 
powder before drawing on the gloves will counteract excess- 
ive perspiration. 

// hands are stained -zcith vegetaMes. — Rub some lemon 
peel on them before washing. 

// fingers become black from tJie pans. — Rub them with 
a little boiled potato and the black will disappear. 

THE NAILS 

The nails like the hair are modified skin. It takes about 
four or five months to grow a finger nail. 

INGROWING NAILS 

The finger nails do not often grow in, but when this hap- 
pens a notch cut in the middle of the nail will have a ten- 
dency to draw it up from the sides. 

White marks on the nails are usually caused by air bubbles 
in the substance of the nail, and they do not indicate ill- 
ness. 

The condition of the finger nails is one of the best tests 
of the care given to the toilet. Well-groomed finger nails 
are a mark of refinement. Needless to say, the toilet is not 
complete until the nails have been thoroughly cleaned, trim-

The best article for use on the nails is a small orange

the skin which adheres to the nails carefuhy pushed back. 
This may also be done with a dry towel. It will prevent the 
skin from cracking about the roots of the nails and forming 
hangnails. This method practiced daily will greatly improve 
the general appearance of the hands. 

It takes only a few minutes each day to put the nails 
in perfect condition. A manicure outfit w-ill cost two or 
three dollars. Buy good instruments to begin with. You 
will need a flexible file, emerv boards, buffer, orange sticks, 
cuticle knife, nail scissors, some red paste and white nail 
powder, and a good bleach of glycerin, rose water, and 
oxalic acid. 

Begin hx shaping the nails with the file. Wdien vou have 
finished one hand, the fingers should be dipped into a bowl 
of lukewarm water, into which has been poured a few drops 
of some pleasant antiseptic as listerine or peroxide of hydro- 
gen. Let them remain in this some time to soften the 
cuticle, and then dry them with a soft towel. 

With the point of the orange stick clean the nail, dipping 
the stick in the bleach if this is necessary. Loosen the skin 
around the nail with the cuticle knife. This skin should be 
lifted up, and not pushed down and back, as the latter move- 
ment cracks and splits the cuticle. Keep dipping the knife 
in the water, as it helps to lift up the cuticle, which must 
be well raised before it is cut. Do not cut the cuticle unless 
absolutely necessary. To do so use the cuticle scissors, and 
try to trim the cuticle in one piece, otherwise you are likely 
to have ragged edges and hangnails. 

Be extremely careful about this special part of the treat- 
ment, for the nail may be altogether spoiled by a too zealous 
use of the cuticle knife and scissors. Use red paste sparing- 
ly, and rub it well into the nails with the palm of the hand. 
It is better to dip the fingers in the water again and dry 
thoroughly, for you cannot polish a wet nail. Smooth the 
edge of the nail with the emery boards . Dip the buffer or 
polisher in the nail powder. Place the center of the buffer 
on the nail, and rub slightly.

TO POLISH THE NAILS 

Apply, with a chamois buffer, a mixture of one ounce 
each of finely powdered emery and cinnabar, softened with 
olive oil, almond oil, or the essention oil of bitter almonds. 

CARE OF THE HAIR 

The hygiene of the scalp determines the preservation of 
the hair. Falling hair and baldness follow dandruff, but 
dandruff' may be prevented or cured by proper care. 

The hair should be shampooed as often as necessary to 
keep the scalp clean — once a month or even once a week. 
Washing the scalp and hair can do no more harm than wash- 
ing the body. 

The proper care of the hair under normal conditions is 
very simple. The objects to be kept in mind are to pre- 
serve its natural luster and texture by means of absolute 
cleanliness, and to massage the scalp sufficiently to remove 
any dandruff that may adhere to it, and thereby promote the 
active circulation of the blood. All this must be done with- 
out injury to the scalp or the hair by pulling, scratching or 
tearing. Cutting the hair frequently has a tendency es- 
pecially in youth, to promote growth. 

To thoroughly cleanse the hair it should be brushed suc- 
cessively from partings made in all directions upon the scalp, 
the utmost care being taken that foreign matter accumulated 
on the brush is removed and not returned by the next stroke 
to the hair. 

Care should be taken on the one hand, not to scratch the 
scalp, tear the roots of the hair, or cause it to split; and on 
the other, not to neglect the stimulating eft'ects of massaging 
the scalp and removing dandruff. In other words, a vig- 
orous brushing should be directed to the head or scalp, the 
gentler stroke being employed in brushing the hair itself. 

Brush the hair free from dust each night before retiring. 
Applications of tonics and restoratives should also be made 
at this time, as they have the best opportunity of doing their 
work during sleep. 

484 



THE HOUSEKEEPIiR 



CARE OF HAIRBRUSHES 

Brushes should be cleaned very often and thoroughly, as 
a surprising amount of dust and dirt gathers in the hair. 
This quickly accumulates in the brushes and fills them. 
Hence the brush should be cleaned immediately after using. 
Wash the brush in warm water to which a little ammonia is 
added. Neither hot water nor soap should be used, and 
the bristles should be allowed to dry thoroughly before 
using them. The effect of hot water and soap is to soften 
the bristles and also the glue with which they are commonly 
fastened into the brush, and when soft, the bristles are 
likely to split and break off or fall out. 

DANDRUFF 

Dandruff is a common disease. It is caused by the forma- 
tion of a scurf on the scalp which becomes detached in fine, 
dry scales. Unless these scales are removed from the hair 
by frequent brushing they give it a dry and lusterless appear- 
ance. 

Among the causes of dandruff may be mentioned weak- 
ness of the scalp from infectious diseases, pressure of heavy 
and close hats, or of the hair matted upon the scalp, excess- 
ive use of hair oils. These conditions should be avoided 
as much as possible, and the scalp should be kept per- 
fectly clean, with due attention to instructions already 
given for its care. Hygienic measures for the improvement 
of the general health are also very important. 

SHAMPOOING 

For shampooing plain toilet soap, ivory or tar soap may 
be used. The important thing is to make sure that all the 
soap is thoroughly rinsed away when the shampoo is fin- 
ished. 

The following preparation is good : 

Dissolve one ounce of salts of tartar in one and one- 
half pints of soft water. Add one ounce of castile soap in 
shavings and 4 ounces of bay rum. The salts of tartar will

486 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



remove dandrnti and the soap will cleanse the hair and 
scalp. 

Apply about one tablespoon ful of the shampoo mixture, 
rubbing it into the scalp with the tips of the fingers and 
working it in thoroughly. Massage with the hands until a 
fine lather is produced. Afterwards rinse with clear soft 
water, first hot then cold, dry the hair with a coarse towel, 
and apply a little oil if desired, to take the place of the 
natural oil which has been removed from the hair by this 
process. 

DRY HAIR SHAMPOO 

Mix four ounces of powdered orris root with one ounce 
of talcum powder, and sprinkle freely through the hair. 
This absorbs the superfluous oil and gives the hair a very 
thick and fluffy appearance. It is especially useful to per 
sons whose hair is heavy and oily. It is also cooling and 
cleansing to the scalp. 

LOOSENING AND FALLING OUT OF THE HAIR 

This often takes place as the result of infectious diseases, 
on account of the weakening of the scalp. Hygienic meas- 
ures to improve the health come first in importance. The 
use of tar soap and the yolk of egg is beneficial. To plunge 
the head into cold water night and morning, and after- 
wards to drv the hair, brushing the scalp briskly to a warm 
glow, is beneficial for men so affected. The recipes for 
\ arious tonics and lotions will be given containing specific 
remedial agents. 

DRY HAIR 

This condition of the hair may be improved by sham- 
pooing the scalp with yolk of egg, as recommended for dan- 
druff, or the scalp may be washed with a weak solution of 
green tea applied cold, or with an emulsion of castile soap 
containing a small quantity of tannin. Alcohol in any form 
is highly objectionable, as it tends by rapid evaporation to 
increase the dryness of the scalp.

Shampooing the scalp with a good shampoo mixture is 
also useful. This condition may occur from too frequent 
washing of the scalp with soap or other substances that de- 
prive it of its natural oils. 

CARE OF THE TEETH 

Good teeth are necessary to health and beauty. 

From the standpoint of health, it must be remembered 
that the process of digestion begins in the mouth. The 
saliva of the mouth has the property of converting starchy 
foods into sugar, thus aiding digestion. And food finely 
divided by proper chewing is more readily acted upon by 
the gastric juice of the stomach. Good teeth are, of course, 
necessary to good mastication. If any of the teeth are lost, 
part of the food is likely to be swallowed without being 
properly chewed, and the ill effects are no less certain be- 
cause they are not always immediately noticed or attributed 
to the true source. 

Teeth of children. — One of the most common causes 
of trouble with the teeth in after life is the mistaken notion 
that children's teeth do not require much attention be- 
cause they will soon be lost and replaced by others. Children 
on the contrary should be taught to clean their teeth at a 
very early age partly because they will thus acquire a habit 
which it will afterwards be more difficult to teach them, but 
especially because the lack of proper development or decay 
of the teeth has a direct effect upon the health of the child, 
and an indirect efifect upon the permanent teeth themselves. 

The appearance of the milk teeth about the seventh month 
is a signal that the child should commence to have solid food 
and should no longer be fed exclusively on milk and other 
soft foods. 

Care of the teeth. — There are two important rules in the 
care of the teeth : keep them clean and consult a good dentist 
at least twice a year. 

489 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



By keeping" the teeth clean, filhng small cavities A\hen they 
first appear, correcting any malformation of the teeth and 
giving advice as to suitable mouth washes and other treat- 
ment when abnormal conditions are present, a positive 
saving in future dentist's bill will be affected ; toothache 
will be avoided, and the teeth themselves will be better pre- 
served. 

The accumulation of tartar in the form of a yellowish 
incrustation, which is usually most plentiful on the inner 
side of the lower jaw is almost universal. But the deposit 
is much more pronounced in some cases than in others. The 
accumulation of tartar cannot always be prevented by brush- 
ing the teeth, although the use of suitable tooth powders, 
pastes or mouth washes will assist, but in all cases where the 
tartar is plentiful, the teeth should be thoroughly cleaned 
by a competent dentist several times a year. The teeth 
should be thoroughly brushed and cleaned at least once a 
day or better still, when possible after each meal and es- 
pecially before retiring at night. 

A toothbrush having medium soft bristles is preferable to 
one having stiff bristles which mav tend to injure or in- 
flame the gum. The shape of the brush is not particularly 
important, although the so-called " prophylactic " brush 
assists in dislodging food from the teeth in the back of the 
mouth. What is more important is the manner in which the 
brush is handled. In addition to the sidewise strokes, the 
brush should also be worked up and down so as to remove 
from between the teeth particles of food that would only 
be crowded in more tightly by rubbing back and forth. This 
is very important. The inner surface of the teeth should 
be brushed in the same manner, care being taken to cover, 
in brushing, every portion of the teeth that can be reached. 
Clean the space between the teeth with a piece of dental 
floss. The mouth should then be thoroughly rinsed.

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



To Whiten the Teeth. — Salt combined with peroxide of 
hydrogen is a powerful bleach. Apply by wetting the brush 
with the pure peroxide and sprinkle with dry salt, but do 
not use oftener than is necessary. 

Tooth powders containing charcoal assist in whitening 
the teeth. A little dry charcoal powder may be rubbed 
gently into the crevices between the teeth on retiring at 
night, and brushed or rinsed out thoroughly in the morning. 
The use of bicarbonate of soda as a tooth powder has the 
same property. 

Foul breath is most often caused by decayed teeth, in- 
flammation of the gums, or neglect to use the toothbrush. 
It may also be caused by catarrh or various diseases of the 
throat and stomach or other internal organs. 

One of the most effective remedies for foul breath is a 
mouth wash composed of a teaspoonful of concentrated 
solution of chloride of soda in a tumbler of water. This 
should be used as a gargle and also forced back and forth 
between the teeth.

CHAPTER XXXVI 



TOILET PREPARATIONS 



Practical suggestions and instructions for preparing all 
kinds of toilet preparations are of interest and value. Many 
toilet preparations made according to recipes given in this 
section are sold in the market. The cost of advertising these 
articles make up a large percentage of their retail price. The 
purchaser has to pay all this in addition to the original 
cost of the ingredients and the labor of compounding. More- 
over, it is not always possible to tell what the ingredients 
are or whether they are of good quality. One can save 
money in compounding them himself. He will know 
exactly what the preparations are composed of, and also 
that the ingredients are fresh and of good ciuality. 

Composition. — The standard basis for solid and semifluid 
preparations, as pastes, creams, and emulsions, are w^hite 
wax, spermaceti, suet, lard, yolk or white of tgg, and 
various soaps. 

Animal fats, as lards, suet, and the like, must be specially 
refined and prepared for toilet purposes. This may be done 
at home by melting and simmering the fat slowly in w^ater 
with gentle heat, and straining it through linen one or more 
times. On cooling the fat will form a cake on top of the 
water. Unless alcohol or other preservatives are mixed 
with the fats they tend to become rancid. Hence small 
quantities at a time should be prepared, and care should be 
taken not to employ such preparations when they become 
in the least rancid. The same caution applies to compounds 
containing the white or yolk of eggs and honey.

495 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



White wax, spermaceti, Castile and other soaps as bases 
are free from these objections, and recipes containing them 
are to be preferred when such ingredients can conveniently 
be obtained. In compounding recipes having these sohd 
unguents as bases they are first melted slowly with gentle 
heat, and while in a melted condition the other ingredients 
are added. They may also be " cut " or dissolved in alcohol 
and spirits. 

Liquid Bases. — Certain toilet preparations, as emulsions, 
lotions, washes, and the like, omit the above solids or employ 
them only in small quantities, and in their place use certain 
oils and other liquids as bases. The principal liquid bases 
are almond oil, olive oil, glycerin, honey, and the like. These 
have a double value : they tend to soothe and also to feed the 
skin. They are, therefore, among the most deservedly 
popular of all ingredients. 

Bases of Pozvders. — Wheat starch is the standard base for 
homemade toilet powders, but other materials often em- 
ployed are Fuller's earth, French chalk, and pearl white. 
Almond meal, like almond oil, has the double property of 
serving as a base and also as a remedial agent. 

Remedial Agents. — This term is employed to describe cer- 
tain ingredients used in toilet preparations which have spe- 
cific curative properties. Some of the bases already men- 
tions, as almonds, are included also under this heading. 
Among others of especial value may be mentioned substances 
which soothe and feed the skin, as the yolk of tgg, honey, 
and cocoa butter ; substances which are mildly astringent, as 
lemon juice, alum, spirits, and benzoin; and other specifics, 
as glycerin, camphor and sulphur, whose action varies with 
different persons. These agents are in most cases of a harm- 
less character. 

Mineral Agents. — The use of mineral drugs in toilet pre- 
parations cannot be too earnestly deprecated. In many cases 
they are immediately harmful and defeat the very object 
for which they are intended. Mineral drugs in toilet pre- 
parations are dangerous and, they are not necessary. The 

496 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



simple and harmless remedies here given, if patiently and 
skillfully applied according to directions, will, in due course 
of time, accomplish the results intended. 

The use of mineral drugs, on the other hand, whatever the 
immediate benefits derived from them may appear to be, 
will in the end defeat its own object by producing after 
effects harmful to the complexion. 

Diluents or J\'Iiiclcs. — Distilled water, various perfumed 
toilet waters, as rose water, together with alcohol and other 
spirits, are the liquids most often recommended for diluting 
toilet preparations to the consistency of creams, lic[uids and 
the like. 

Distilled water may be prepared at home by attaching a 
tube to the spout of the teakettle, immersing as much of its 
length as possible in a basin of water shielded from the fire 
and kept cold, if convenient, with ice, and collecting the con- 
densed steam at the opposite end of the tube in a fruit jar or 
other receptacle. The object of this process is to remove all 
impurities held in suspension, as lime and other minerals 
which are found in hard water; also vegetable and animal 
matter and other impurities. The ordinary water supply, 
softened if necessary will usually answer every purpose. 
Rose water or plain distilled or soft water may be used in all 
cases. 

Perfumes. — Substances used as perfumes commonly occur 
in several forms, i. e.. the attar or essential oil, the essence, 
and the tincture or the " water," depending upon the degree 
of dilution. They can also be obtained in powdered form, 
as in sachets. The most convenient form in which to pur- 
chase perfumes is the attar, i. e., the essential oil. This may 
be purchased in small quantities and employed according to 
taste, a few drops being sufficient to perfume most toilet 
preparations in quantities suitable for domestic use. 

Utensils Required. — The utensils required in compound- 
ing the following recipes are usually found in every house- 
hold. A small pair of scales, a graduate glass, marked for 
the measurement of fluid ounces, a small spatula or thin 

497 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



broad-bladed, flexible knife, a small mortar and pestle, and 
one or two short pieces of glass tube or rod for stirring, will 
be found convenient. Ordinary porcelain-lined saucepans 
are the best receptacles in which to melt and mix the neces- 
sary ingredients. A double boiler is convenient. 

Directions for Compounding. — First place the solid or 
liquid constituent used as a base in a double boiler or sauce- 
pan. Simmer without boiling until the solids are melted 
and the mass is warm enough to flow freely. Strain through 
linen while still hot. 

Return the mixture to the double boiler, and while hot add 
such specific remedial agents as the oil of bitter almonds, 
honey, glycerin, benzoin, lemon juice, alum, etc. 

li rose water or distilled water is to be added to form an 
emulsion, lotion, or wash, take the mixture off the fire and 
add the water gradually, stirring briskly with a spoon or egg 
beater to insure forming a perfect emulsion. The last 
ingredient to be added is always the perfume, and this 
should be done after the mixture has cooled somewhat, but 
before it sets. Perfumes are volatile, and if added to a 
heated mixture are likely to be wasted by evaporation. 

Compaunding of Pastes and Powders. — The above in- 
structions apply especially to licjuid compounds. The solid 
constituents of pastes may be rubbed together in a mortar, 
and kneaded with the hands or with a spatula on a marble 
or a kneading board. In some cases an tgg beater can be 
employed if the consistency of the mixture will allow it. 
Almonds for pastes may be reduced in a mortar to the 
proper consistency by moistening them with rose water and 
grinding them with a pestle, or by heating them with water 
in a saucepan until the mass assumes a granular consistency, 
somewhat similar to cooked oatmeal. Both methods are 
employed, but the former is the more common. The ma- 
terials for toilet powders may be compounded by simple 
mixture in a mortar or other suitable receptacle. 

498

Tables. — A number of tables have been prepared which 
contain practically all the standard recipes fof the toilet. 
An exception to this statement has already been noted; all 
recipes containing preparations of lead and other injurious 
mineral drugs have been omitted. A list of the different in- 
gredients is given at the left of the table, and the name of 
each preparation is quoted at the top. Under each name 
and opposite the names of the different ingredients will be 
found the amount of each to be employed. General direc- 
tions for compounding the recipes have already been given. 

Milk for the Skin. — New milk, skimmed milk, butter- 
milk each possess properties peculiar to itself, and they all 
make useful and simple washes having a general emolient 
action on the skin. If used daily they tend to make the skin 
soft, smooth, and white, and to preserve it from the effects 
of exposure to weather. Buttermilk is useful for freckles 
and relieves itching. 

Lotions for Tan or Sunburn. — These are based princi- 
pally on oil of almonds, with the addition of castile soap and 
rock candy, and contain various remedial agents, including 
astringents, as alum and lemon juice, also benzoin, tincture 
of tolu, tartar oil, and the like. They are diluted usually 
with alcohol or any perfumed toilet water, for which plain 
distilled or soft water may be substituted. And they may 
be perfumed with any essential oil or essence preferred. 
Apply any of these lotions to the face with a small sponge 
or a soft linen rag. Let it dry on without rubbing, and 
afterwards wash the face with soft warm water. 

The following is a simple remedy for tan or sunburn: 
apply peroxide of hydrogen, pouring a teaspoonful or more 
in the palm of the hand, and applying it equally over the 
hands, arms, and face. Let it dry without rubbing. After 
it is thoroughly dry, apply any good lotion. This will 
rapidly bleach the skin without injuring the most delicate 
complexion.

TOILET POWDERS 

The foundation for toilet powders are compounds of 
magnesia, including talc or talcum — which chemically is 
magnesium silicate ; and which is mined in large quantities, 
and French chalk, which is ground soapstone; fuller's earth, 
a greenish clay found in many parts of England and on the 
continent of Europe; and starch, especially rice and wheat 
starch, which is sometimes mixed with cornstarch, potato 
starch, etc. These preparations usually contain pulverized 
perfumed woods, as orris root, sandalwood, and other per- 
fumes. 

The following are standard preparations which contain 
no injurious ingredients : 

For plain face powder without perfume, pure white 
starch can be used. 

Mix together equal quantities of rice fiour, fuller's earth, 
and white starch, and perfume with any essential oil as rose 
or violet. 

For violet powder, mix 3 ounces of white starch with 1 
ounce of powdered orris root, rub together in water, and 
perfume with the essential oils of lemon, bergamot and 
cloves, using twice as much lemon as bergamot and cloves. 

For a rose face powder, mix 8 ounces of pulverized rose 
leaves with 4 ounces of pulverized sandalwood, and add 1 
dram of the attar of roses. 

Or to 3^ pounds of powdered rose or white starch, add 
% dram of rose pink and 1 dram each of rose oil and santal 
oil. 

Perfumes. The use of strong perfumes is rapidly grow- 
ing out of fashion, but the natural fragrance of flowers, 
spices and perfumed woods — the sources of the ingredients 
used in perfumery — is, however, so delightful that those 
substances are likely always to be employed to a certain 
extent in the toilet. 

506 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



The various forms in which perfumes are placed upon 
the market are, according to the degree of dikition, the attar 
or essential oil, the essence or extract, and the perfumed 
toilet water. Innumerable compounds are sold under various 
names as colognes, scents, spirits, (French esprit), and the 
like. The substances from which these perfumes are ob- 
tained may also in some cases be purchased, as the dry leaves 
or flowers of plants and various kinds of wood or roots. 

Perfumes are also used in the form of sachets or dry 
powder, to be placed among garments or linen, either in 
sachet bags or scattered loosely in chests and drawers. They 
are likewise employed to perfume the atmosphere of a room 
by putting in open jars, or burning them. 

Generally speaking, the most convenient form in which 
to obtain perfumes is the attar or essential oil. A few drops 
of these concentrated substances, usually about 5 or 6 drops 
to the pint or pound, will yield any desired odor. When the 
essence, the perfumed water, or the original substances 
themselves are prescribed in recipes, the essential oil can be 
substituted in most cases.

COLD CREAM 

Cold creams. The foundation of most cold creams is 
either white wax or spermaceti or both, with almond oil or 
animal fats, as lard, suet, and the like, to which may be 
added various specifics for the complexion, and distilled 
waters, essences, or essential oils to perfume as desired. 

Cold cream is among the most useful of toilet prepara- 
tions, both as a preventitive and as a remedy for sunburn 
and reddening of the skin by exposure, frostbite, and other 
local irratations. It is also useful for whitening the hands 
and preventing wrinkles. For this purpose it should be ap- 
plied at night and thoroughly washed off in the morning. 
The hands may be protected at night by a loose pair of kid 
or chamois gloves.

ROUGE 

The base of rouge for the Hps and cheeks is usually 
French chalk, almond oil, or other animal fat, or oil, or 
one of the gums, as gum tragacanth, colored with cochi- 
neal, carmine, vermillion, alkanet, or other red coloring 
matter, and perfumed. To this may be added a mild 
astringent, as alum, acetic acid, and the like. 

For carmine rouge, bring to the boiling point in an alum- 
inum or copper vessel one cjuart of distilled water, to which 
add one ounce of the best pulverized cochineal. After five 
or six minutes stir in carefully thirty grains of powdered 
Roman alum. Continue boiling three to five minutes and 
set aside to cool. When lukewarm, but before the mixture 
settles, pour off the clear liquid from the sediment through 
a piece of white silk or chiffon into a glass fruit jar. Let 
stand three or four days and again pour off through white 
silk into another vessel. Allow the liquor to settle ; pour 
off the clear liquor from the top, and dry the sediment care- 
fully in a cool place. The result is a very finely divided 
powder, making a rouge of the best quality. 

TOILET SOAP 

One pound Cotton Seed oil. 

H pound lard. 

1 tablespoonful lye. 

F)4 cupful cold water. 

5 drops lavender or oil of geranium. 

Dissolve the lye in cold water stirring with a stick, add 
the melted fats slowly stirring until the soap begins to 
thicken. Add the perfume and pour into small boxes lined 
with greased paper to become firm. Agate and wooden 
utensils should be used in soap making. It is more eco- 
nomical to dry the soap for sometime before using.

CHAPTER XXXVn 



CARE OF CHILDREN 



The health of the mother during pregnancy is of the 
greatest importance for the normal development of the un- 
born child dei)ends very largely upon her physical strength 
and mental balance. Wholesome food, a pleasant envi- 
ronment, congenial associates, plenty of exercise and fresh 
air should all be secured for the expectant mother if pos- 
sible. 

The exercise involved in housework and walking is 
beneficial but violent exercise such as laundry work, hill 
climbing, etc., should be avoided as it may be positively 
injurious. 

The clothing should be loose and comfortable. The 
heavy demands made upon the energy of the mother in 
supplying nourishment not only for herself but for the 
unborn child require an increased amount of food and 
extra sleep. A nap in the afternoon is beneficial if it does 
not interfere with sleep at night. 

A liberal sui)ply of nourishment and easily digested food 
should be eaten. Plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables 
should make up a part of the diet as these tend to overcome 
constipation and furnish the necessary supply of mineral 
matter. 

If materials for the growth of the baby are lacking in the 
food they will be used as far as oossible from the mother's 
body. For example, if the diet is deficient in calcium and 
phosphorous for; the formation of bones, the mother's 
bones and teeth are likely to sufTer loss. For the most part 
the same kinds of food which are adapted to the mother 
under ordinary conditions are suitable for the mother and 
child.

516 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



The preparation for the advent of the baby should be 
simple and completed before the last weeks of pregnancy 
thereby avoiding undue work. 

The mother should be under the care of a physician 
during the period of gestation. 

CARE OF THE CHILD 

Since the life of the infant and his entire future health 
depend upon his early care intelligent study of the hygiene 
and care of infants is the duty of every mother. 

BATHING 

Give the baby a bath every morning, preferably at a 
certain regular hour, but never bathe within an hour after 
feeding. The first full bath should not be given for a week 
or ten days after birth. The water should be 98° to 100° 
Fahrenheit during the first few weeks. If the infant is 
vigorous the temperature may gradually be reduced to 95° 
at six months and 85° to 90° during the second year. Bathe 
the baby in a warm room. 

The head and face should first be washed and dried, then 
the body should be soaped and the baby placed in the tub. 
Hold the baby so that he will be firmly supported and bathe 
him quickly. Dry the body cjuickly by patting with a soft 
towel but do not rub. Use only the best and mildest soap 
sparingly and rinse the body carefully. 

At birth the physician cleanses the baby's eyes with an 
antiseptic. Every morning at the time of the bath the 
baby's eyes should be gently cleansed with a piece of ab- 
sorbent cotton soaked in a solution of salt or boric acid 
using one teaspoon ful boric acid to one pint of water. 

Also swab out the baby's mouth with the boric acid 
solution using a bit of absorbent cotton on a tooth pick. 
This is not necessary after every feeding but should be done 
twice a day. 

517 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 




Yon will find the above article to be all 
that is claimed for it by the manufacturer. 

Laura A. Hunt. 

518 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Keep the baby's skin from chafing by dusting with 
powder under the arms, about the neck, and in the groin. 
This is especially important with very fat babies. 

If the baby is chafed do not use soap for his bath but 
give him a bran bath. Place one pint of wheat bran in a 
cheese cloth bag and put this in the bath water,' scjueezing 
the bran until the water looks milky. 

The greatest care should be taken that all napkins are 
removed as soon as wet or soiled and the groin kept scru- 
pulously clean and well powdered. If the skin becomes 
chafed apply sweet oil. 

CLOTHING 

While dressing the baby let him lie upon the lap until he 
is quite old enough to sit alone. Draw the clothing over 
his feet as this is easier than putting it on over his head. 

The clothing of infants should be simple, warm, light in 
weight and not too tight fitting. For the first four or five 
months provide an abdominal band of thin, soft wool or 
fiannel. This will prevent serious efifects from sudden 
changes of temperature. The band should be smooth and 
free from creases or folds and fastened with safety pins, 
or preferably with a few stitches of soft darning cotton. 
It must not be pinned so tightly as to interfere with the free 
movements of the chest in breathing. 

In healthy infants the flannel band may be replaced after 
the third or fourth month by the knitted band which should 
be worn at least to the eighteenth month. All the baby's 
clothing should be loose enough to allow it to breathe and 
move its limbs easily and to admit of the free circulation of 
blood. Never use clothing with tight waistbands. Skirts 
should be supported from the shoulders by straps. Do not 
put stiff or uncomfortable clothing on a baby. 

Infants are very susceptible to changes of temperature. 
The clothing should be modified with each change in the 
weather. Either overheating or sudden chill tends to pro- 
duce stomach or intestinal complaints. Cool outdoor air 

519 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



will not harm children even in winter or in cold climates, 
if they are well wrapped up, protected from changes of 
temperature and kept out of drafts. 

Clothing worn during the day which is to be worn again 
should be hung up to air, preferably out of doors. Gar- 
ments worn at night should be hung up to air during the 
day. Both the baby and its clothing should be kept at all 
times clean, sweet and free from odor. 

Napkins 

For the very young baby napkins made from pieces of 
old table linen will prove most satisfactory. . They are soft 
and easily washed. 

Napkins should immediately be removed from the nur- 
sery when soiled or wet. Soiled napkins should be kept in a 
covered receptacle and roughly washed as soon as possible, 
then soak them in clear water until a convenient time for 
washing. After washing them in hot suds they should be 
boiled for fifteen minutes. 

Clean napkins, changed as soon as they are wet or soiled 
are essential in keeping the skin healthy. . 

Fresh Air 

This is important to the baby's health. As soon as the 
baby is accustcmed to outdoor air, keep one or more win- 
dows open in his sleeping room winter and summer, during 
both night and day. 

Many children take their naps in the open air and often 
these children are stronger and less apt to take cold than 
others. 

When the baby is outdoors see that he is dressed warm 
enough, that the wind does not blow in his face and that 
the sun does not shine directly in his eyes. 

NATURAL DEVELOPMENT 

A child should never be urged to walk, he will do so 
when his bones and muscles are strong enough. The aver- 
age child walks at fifteen months. Children can generally 
say a few single words at one year of age. 

520 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



DENTITION 

The two lower center teeth usually come first, followed 
bv the four upper center teeth. The child may be expected 
to have these six teeth by the first year. Then come the 
other two lower central teeth and the four front double 
teeth. Next the eye and stomach teeth come usually be- 
fore the child is two years old. The four back double 
teeth come about the time the child is two years and a half 
old. 

INFANT FEEDING 

Alother's milk is the best food for an infant. Statistics 
show that the mortality of bottle-fed babies during the first 
year is three times that of breast-fed babies. 

Put the child to the breast every six hours the first day, 
and every four hours the second day after birth, or 
oftener if it fails to nurse or obtain nourishment. Usually 
a good flow of milk is not established until the fourth, fifth 
or sixth day. 

The nursing should not last more than twenty minutes. 
Never let the baby go to sleep with the nipple in its mouth. 
After the milk comes, usually from the third day on, the 
frecjuency of nursing during the first year is shown in the 
following table from Holt: 

Night 
N ursings nursings 

Period in 24 Interval (10 P.M.

6 weeks to 3 months 8 2^ " 2 

3 to 5 months 7 3 " 1 

5 to 12 months 6 3" 

The baby should not be allowed to nurse except at the 
regular intervals. It is a great, but very common mis- 
take to put the baby to the breast every time it cries. It is

more likely to be thirsty or sutfering from over- feeding 
than to be hungry. Give it a drink of water, but do not 
nurse it until the regular time. The water should be 
boiled at least ten minutes, then cooled and kept in a cov- 
ered jar and given to the baby luke warm. Have water 
boiled for the baby each day. 

CARE OF THE NURSING MOTHER 

A nursing mother must take care of herself in order to 
keep her baby well. Breast-fed babies often vomit or have 
diarrhoea because the mother is sick or tired out, or be- 
cause the milk is poor. Causes which weaken the mother 
and injure her milk are improper food, irregular meals, 
exhaustion from over-work or lack of sleep, and too fre- 
cjuent or prolonged nursing. She should sleep as much as 
possible in a room with windows wide open. It is well to 
sleep for at least one hour during the day. 

Nursing mothers should keep themselves well and their 
milk in good condition, by eating at regular hours three 
plain, well-cooked meals a day, consisting of milk, meat, 
vegetables, and cereals. They should drink freely between 
meals of pure cold water. The notion that large quantities 
of tea, coffee and beer improve the quality of the mother's 
milk is mistaken. Beer and tea are always harmful and 
large quantities are positively dangerous. The mother 
should keep her bowels regular, as constipation in a nurs- 
ing mother often causes colic in her child. If the mother is 
ill or run down, or the baby has diarrhoea and vomiting, 
she should consult a doctor at once, before giving the baby 
other foods or bottle feeding. 

WEANING 

Usually a child is weaned at the ninth or tenth month. 
Reasons for weaning earlier are failure of child to develop 
normally and gain in weight, or the serious illness or preg- 
nancy of the mother. The time for weaning the baby will 

523 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



depend partly upon the state of the mother's heaUh, and 
partly upon the season of the year. Some mothers ought 
to wean their infants at six months, others may nurse them 
a full year. The average is about nine or ten months. 
Nursing the child too long is an unnecessary drain upon 
the mother. There is also great danger of injury to the 
child. Consult a physician as to the time for weaning the 
baby. Wean gradually by giving one breast, feeding less 
each day and teach the baby to drink from a cup or bottle. 

With the advice and consent of the physician, you may 
begin during the fifth or sixth month to teach the baby to 
take food and water from a bottle. Thus the baby will be 
fed for some time with both breast milk and artificial food, 
and there will be time for his stomach to adjust itself to 
the change. This plan will materially decrease both the 
difficulties and dangers of weaning. 

In changing from breast milk to cow's milk, the milk 
used first should be very much diluted and modified. unless 
the baby has been given a bottle in addition to the mother's 
milk. In weaning a six months' old baby give the milk 
usually given to an infant three months old. The quantity 
should be larger and the food can be gradually increased 
so that in a few weeks the usual strength for the age can 



be taken. 



ARTIFICIAL FEEDING 



All doctors of experience agree that the problem of the 
artificial feeding of infants is one of the most serious 
which they are called upon to face. Some babies have to 
be put on the bottle at birth or during the first few weeks 
or months of life. All must be weaned sooner or later. 
Hence, this is a problem which must be worked out for 
every single child. There are certain facts and principles 
which every mother should know because they are of im- 
portance in all cases. But every mother should clearly un- 
derstand that no set of rules can be laid down which will 
be adapted in all respects to any child. Each baby needs a 

524

combination suited to his digestion. The mixture upon 
which some other baby is thriving may be too strong or 
too weak for your baby. The only way to learn what food 
will agree with your baby is by experience. 

There is no perfect substitute for mother's milk. The 
milk of the cow and other animals, condensed milk, and 
artificial manufactured foods are unnatural and unsatis- 
factory makeshifts. All of these substitutes have been 
often anaylzed and the difference between them and the 
natural food of infancy is clearly understood. Condensed 
milk contains too much sugar and not enough fat. None of 
the manufactured foods most commonly used contain suffi- 
cient fat ; some contain too much starch, others too much 
sugar. At times some of these substitutes may be used to 
advantage, but none of them can take the place of mother's 
milk. 

Cow's milk is the best available substitute for mother's 
milk. 

Milk to be fit for infant feeding should come from 
healthy cows, milk from a herd is better than that from 
one cow, as it is less likely to vary from day to day. The 
milk should be handled only by healthy persons and be 
kept clean and free from contamination. The cows, stables 
and milkers should be clean, the milk should be cooled rap- 
idly as soon as drawn and it should be transported in 
sterile bottles which are sealed. If certified milk can be 
obtained this is best for infant feeding; but milk as it is 
ordinarily handled should not be used for infants after it is 
forty-eight hours old in winter and twenty-four hours old 
in summer. 

When the milk is received in the home it should at once 
be placed in the refrigerator or where it will be kept at a 
temperature of 50° Fahrenheit. Milk purchased in bulk 
should never be used for infant feeding when bottled milk 
can be obtained. Even if the milk is clean, fresh and cool 
when it is delivered at your door, or if you then kill the 
germs which it may contain by home pasteurization, it may 

525

afterwards become unfit for food, especially for babies, by 
improper treatment. This may occur if you place it in un- 
clean vessels, expose it unnecessarily to the air, or fail to 
keep it cool up to the time of using, hence the following 
suggestions. 

Buy bottle milk, at least for your baby. Keep milk in 
the original bottle till needed for immediate consumption. 
Carefully wipe or rinse the bottle, especially the mouth, 
before pouring any milk from it, so that dust or dirt which 
may have gathered thereon or on the cap will not get into 
the milk. Do not pour back into the bottle milk which has 
been exposed to the air by being placed in other vessels. 
Keep the bottle covered with a paper cap as long as milk is 
in it and when not actually pouring from it. H the paper 
cap has been punctured, cover the bottle with an inverted 
tumbler. 

COMPARISON OF COW'S MILK AND HUMAN MILK 

Human Milk Cozv's Milk 

Water 87.5% 87% 

Fat 4% 4% 

Milk Sugar 6.7% 5% 

Mineral Matter 0.2% 0.7% 

Protein 1.5% 3.2% 

By comparing the tables showing the composition of hu- 
man and cow's milk, it will be seen that cow's milk contains 
more protein and mineral matter and less sugar of milk, the 
fat and water varying but little. The calf grows faster 
than the baby, therefore needs more building material. The 
baby, having a relatively larger surface exposed, loses more 
heat. 

The protein of milk is composed of lactalbumin and 
caseinogen. Lactalbumin is soluble in water, and as there 
is a larger percentage of this constituent in human than in 
cow's milk, the former during digestion forms into succu- 
lent curds; while the latter, containing more caseinogen, 
forms into dense cheesy curds. 

526 



THE H O U S E K E E P F: R 



In addition to the difference in composition of human and 
cow's milk it must be remembered that mother's milk is fed 
fresh and is practically sterile, while cow's milk is generally 
kept twenty- four hours or longer and is to a greater or less 
degree contaminated by bacteria. 

Cow's milk to form a typical infant food needs to be 
"modified" or changed so that its composition resembles as 
closely as possible that of the mother's milk. 

Cow's milk has about half as much sugar as human milk, 
has nearly three times as much protein and mineral matter, 
and its protein and fat are different and harder to digest. 

Lime water is sometimes used when the baby's digestion 
is disturbed to overcome the acidity of cow's milk and to 
lessen the consistency of the curd. There are some infants 
with whom it does not agree, and if used too freely it may 
cause constipation. One ounce of lime water to twenty 
ounces of food is the usual proportion. 

Cow's milk is diluted to obtain the proper proportion of 
protein — this of course dilutes the sugar and fat also. In 
some cases top milk is used to increase the fat percentage 
and sugar is always added. 

Only boiled water should be used for diluting the milk. 
The sugar is required to give energy; usually 3 level table- 
spoonfuls of milk sugar to 20 ounces of food are used. The 
sugar should be dissolved in the boiled water. 

Cane sugar may be used in place of milk sugar, and in this 
case 2 tablespoonfuls to 20 ounces of food are used. Malt- 
ose, another form of sugar, is often used, it is easily digested 
and is useful if there is constipation. Use 3 tablespoonfuls 
Maltose to 20 ounces of food. 

Milk usually contains about 4% of fat. We speak of this 
as whole milk. Top milk is the thin cream removed from 
the top of a bottle of milk after it has stood several hours. 
Seven per cent milk contains 7% fat and is obtained by re- 
moving the upper 16 ounces, or one-half, from a quart 
bottle. 

527 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



The top milk should not be poured from the bottle, but 
should be removed by a small dipper known as the "Chapin 
dipper" which holds one ounce; or it may be taken oft with 
a spoon. 

Upper \y2 ounces well shaken will yield approximately 
32% cream. 

Upper 4 ounces well shaken will yield approximately 
20% cream. 

Upper 6 ounces well shaken will yield approximately 
16% cream. 

Upper 8 ounces well shaken will yield approximately 
12% cream. 

Upper 1 1 ounces well shaken will yield approximately 
10% cream. 

The lowest 8 ounces will yield practically fat free milk, 
the middle milk is not used. 

The providing of formulas for home modifications of 
milk is plainly the work of the physician. He not only can 
recommend the best formula for the individual child, but 
can watch the child's growth and progress and can make 
an}' necessary changes in the food. However, for examples 
we give the following formulas and directions for infant 
feeding, quoting from Dr. Emmett Holt's book, ''The Care 
and Feeding of Children,'' which we consider to be one of 
the most reliable sources for information on this subject. 

The simplest way of modifying milk is to use whole milk 
in the required amounts, diluted and changed according to 
the directions given.

This schedule gives the averages for healthy children. 
The smaller c(iiantities are those required by small children 
whose digestion is not very vigorous. The larger cjuantities 
are those required by large children with strong digestion; 
in very few cases will it be advisable to go above these 
figures. 

MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR MILK MIXING 

It is good economy to equip yourself at the outset with 
a full set of proper utensils for mixing the baby's milk. 
You will require an eight-ounce glass graduate, a glass 
funnel, a cream dipper, a dozen nursing bottles, a half 
dozen black rubber nipples, and a bottle brush for washing 
out the bottles, li you buy milk in bottles and measure 
it in a glass graduate you will not need to use pitchers, cups, 
or other measures. But whatever utensils you do use for 
mixing the baby's food should be kept by themselves, washed 
separately, boiled and drained without wiping, and not 
put into the dish water or wiped with a dish towel in the 
ordinary way. 

All utensils used in preparing baby food should be of 
glass, china, porcelain or granite-ironware. These will not 
rust nor present crevices for the accumulation of dirt. 
Never use vessels or utensils which are cracked or have 
rough edges or surfaces. Select nursing bottles with round 
bottoms and free from angles. The best bottles are marked 
with a scale of ounces so that the exact amount given may be 
measured at each feeding. It is advisable to purchase a 
dozen bottles because it is much more convenient to mix in 
the morning the food for the entire day. Put enough for 
each feeding in a separate bottle and then place the bottles 
on ice. Ten feedings will be required for small infants and 
it is well to have extra bottles on hand in case of breakage. 
Fewer bottles may be used, but no mother should attempt to 
get along with less than two. It is better to have plenty of 
bottles so that the same bottles will not have to be used too 
frequently.

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Place the nursing bottles and all utensils used for prepar- 
ing the baby's milk in a pan, cover them with cold water, 
heat to the boiling point and boil for ten minutes. This 
should be done once a day. 

Nipples when purchased should be sterilized in boiling 
water for ten minutes. Wash the nipple after each feeding 
and keep it in a glass containing water in which boric acid 
is dis.solved. using 1 teaspoonful boric acid to 1 pint water. 

Clean the nursing bottle immediately after each feeding. 
First rinse with clear cold water. Wash with hot water, fill 
the bottle with clean boiled water and a little piece of cook- 
ing soda the size of a pea and let the water stand in the bottle 
until the next feeding. Never let the bottle stand with milk 
in it. Never try to save what is left from one feeding until 
the next. 

BOTTLE FEEDING 

Prepare each morning enough food to last for twenty- 
four hours and place the required quantity for each nursing 
in a separate nursing bottle. Plug the bottles with baked 
absorbent cotton or antiseptic gauze. 

Or, if you do not have enough nursing bottles, prepare 
enough food for twenty- four hours and place it in a clean, 
freshly boiled fruit jar with a glass clamp top. Do not use 
the screw-top jars, they are not so easy to keep clean. Do 
not use the rubber ring, it is hard to keep clean and is not 
necessary. 

Use only freshly boiled water for mixing the food. Keep 
it until ready for use, in the same vessel in which it was 
boiled. Now mix the food exactly as the doctor directs, 
in accordance with the formula you have adopted. Always 
mix it exactly the same way. As soon as the food has been 
placed in nursing Ijottles or fruit jar, and stoppered prop- 
erlv, put these on ice or in the coolest place you can find. 
Work quickly and do not let the milk or prepared food stand 
in a warm room any longer than is necessary. 

533 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Feeding the Baby. — Keep the food on ice until ready for 
use and heat it when the baby needs it. Never let the bottle 
stand in a warm room with milk in it. Do not attempt to 
keep milk at a luke-warm temperature at night or any other 
time in a thermos bottle or by any other arrangement. 
Such a device simply acts as a incubator for germs which, 
at this temperature, quickly grow to enormous numbers and 
render the milk dangerous. 

Place the nursing bottle in hot water when needed and 
warm the food to body heat. Do not give the baby cold 
milk. Do not give the baby hot milk. Make the tempera- 
ture just right, ^^'ash your hands in soap and water before 
adjusting the nipple. Never put the nipple in your own 
mouth to find out whether the milk is warm enough. Try it 
on your wrist, or taste a little from a spoon. 

Shake the bottle before using it. 

Do not feed a baby under six months of age from a cup or 
spoon. Sucking is the natural way by which a baby takes its 
food. It needs the sucking action of the lips, mouth and 
tongue to mix its food with the fluids of the mouth. 

Feeding Problems. — If a bottle-fed baby does not thrive 
the difficulty may be that the food is too rich, or not rich 
enough; that the amount fed is too much, or too little; or 
that the food spoils before it is fed from not being kept 
clean and cold. The food must be kept clean and cold to 
be whc^ilcsome at any age. But the quality of the food, the 
amount to be given at each feeding, and the frequency of 
the feeding must be modified and adapted to the needs of the 
.growing child. It is usual to give rules for feeding accord- 
mg to the age of the child, but regard must also be given to 
its weight in pounds. 

HOW TO PASTEURIZE MILK 

Put milk in sterile, small-mouthed glass bottles, stop with 
cotton batting or absorbent cotton, place bottles in wire 
basket, immerse in kettle of cold water, and heat water 

534 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



gradually, to a temptraeure of from 150° to 155° Fahren- 
heit. Keep at same temperature thirty minutes. Remove 
bottles, cool quickly, and put in a cold place. 

By this process almost all of the disease germs are killed ; 
also those germs which produce souring; but the spores, 
which are not killed, will develop after a few days. If one 
is obliged to obtain milk from a doubtful source it may be 
necessary to resort to this method during the hot weather. 
The health of the child is the only guide to decide when its 
use may be discontinued. 

Fannie M. Farmer. 

OTHER FOODS FOR INFANTS 

Keep the baby largely on milk, about 1 quart a day, until 
well into the second year. This is the chief secret of suc- 
cessful infant feeding. There is far less necessity for a 
mixed diet of ordinary foods than is generally supposed. 
No other food than properly modified milk should be given 
until the end of the sixth or seventh month, except on the 
order of a physician. The appearance of teeth at a moder- 
ately early age is simply an evidence of health. It is not an 
indication that the baby should be taught to eat solid food. 

As a rule no solid food whatever should be given during 
the first year. After the seventh month, gruel made with 
barley, arrowroot or oatmeal may be given, beginning with 
very small quantities. At first four ounces of thick strained 
oatmeal and one-half ounce of orange juice may be added 
to the daily allowance of food. The cjuantity of gruel may 
be gradually increased as the child grows older. The addi- 
tion of a pinch of salt will make the food more palatable, 
and it is essential that the cereal be thoroughly cooked. For 
oatmeal, cooking three hours in a double boiler is not too 
long and over night cooking is preferable. 

After the ninth month pure whole milk may be allowed in 
some cases and the child may have a crust of bread, or a 
small piece of zwieback. An egg yolk or a soft cooked egg 
may be given when the baby is about one year old .

During the second year milk is the chief article of diet, 
and the following foods may be given : well-cooked cereals 
(first strained but later unstrained), fruit juice, egg yolk, 
stale bread, and vegetable pulp. 

Throughout the whole period of infancy, food other than 
milk should be selected and prepared with care and given in 
moderation. During the second year children are almost in- 
variably overfed. 

DIET OF OLDER CHILDREN 

Milk should continue to be an important article of diet 
even to the age of ten years. The simple well cooked foods 
are best for children and a larger variety of foods being 
given until the range of food materials for the twelve year 
old child available is practically the same as for the adult 
with the exception, of course, of rich pastry, preserves, and 
fried foods. 

CONTAGIOUS DISEASES OF CHILDREN 

Mothers, and other persons in immediate charge of small 
children should be constantly upon the look-out for symp- 
toms of communicable diseases and other common con- 
ditions requiring medical attention. 

Never expose children to any contagious disease in order 
that thev may have it at once and b^e over it. Even the so- 
called simple children's diseases, as whooping cough and 
measles have a high death rate. Young children contract 
these diseases readily while the normal adult is not so easily 
susceptible to them. 

SCARLET FEVER 

Scarlet fever is highly contagious, but, like other germ 
diseases, is wholly preventable. It is. or should be, among 
the most dreaded of all the acute diseases of childhood. It 
attacks chiefly children between the ages of one and ten 

537 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



years, although about five per cent of all cases occur in 
adult life. After childhood the liability to take the disease 
is very much lessened. Many persons who escape the 
disease in childhood have been immune to it, although 
many times exposed in later life. 

SYMPTOiMS 

The period of incubation after exposure varies from one 
to fourteen days. Hence a child exposed to scarlet fever 
should be carefully watched during the following two 
weeks. Upon the first symptoms of shivering, lassitude, 
headache, rapid pulse, hot, dry skin, flushed face, coated 
tongue with much thirst and loss of appetite, the patient 
should be isolated until a positive diagnosis can be made by 
a physician. 

Vomiting is usually among the first positive symptoms. 
Other symptoms are sore throat, intense fever with head- 
ache or backache, and the characteristic scarlet rash. This 
usually appears in from twelve to twenty-four hours, first 
upon the lower part of the neck and adjacent parts of the 
chest and afterwards gradually spreading over the entire 
body. 

The chief danger from contact infection is from scales 
from the skin, the spittle from the throat and mouth and 
the nose and ear discharges. But all the discharges of the 
patient should be disinfected. 

MEASLES 

Measles is the most contagious eruptive disease of child- 
hood. It is probably a germ disease. German measles is 
not a form of measles nor is it a mild type of scarlet fever, 
it is a distinct disease. Measles may occur at any time dur- 
ing the year, but it is most prevalent in the fall and winter 
months.

SYMPTOMS 

The period of incubation is from ten to fourteen days 
after exposure. The symptoms for the first two days are 
very much hke those of an ordinary cold in the head. The 
eyes become red and watery and are sensitive to Hght. The 
nose is stopped up or there is a discharge from the nose, 
with sneezing. The throat is sore, and there is a dry, hard, 
cough. The tonsils may be swollen or red, headache, fever, 
loss of appetite, drowsiness and irritability are usually 
observed. 

The characteristic skin eruption appears on the fourth 
day on the face and neck and thence over the whole body, 
as dull red blotches a little raised, and later running to- 
gether. It gives the skin a peculiar appearance. Before 
this occurs one cannot be positive that the case is one of 
measles. 

The danger from measles is chiefly due to complication 
with other diseases such as whooping cough and bronchial 
pneumonia. 

Modes of I nfccf ion.— Measles is contagious from the be- 
ginning of the symptoms usually three or four davs before 
the eruption occurs. It is during this first stage of the 
disease, when the symptoms can hardly be distinguished 
from those of an ordinary cold in the head, that the disease 
is most often communicated. The disease is usually con- 
veyed to others by the discharge of the nose and throat. 

MUMPS 

Mumps is a glandular swelling in the angle between the 
jaw and the ear. It is a highly contagious but wholly un- 
necessarv and preventable disease. It chiefly afifects chil- 
dren, but may attack older persons who have not become 
immune from having had the disease in childhood. It 
usually develops in from two to three weeks after exposure. 

540 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



WHOOPING COUGH 

This is a contagious disease characterized by severe in- 
flammation of the bronchial tubes and accompanied by a 
pecuHar cough ending in the famiHar "whoop." It has all 
the characteristics of a germ disease. Persons of all ages 
are liable to the attacks of this malady. Children should 
never be knowingly exposed to whooping cough and great 
care should be taken to protect children under five years of 
age from infection. After this period the likelihood of in- 
fection is much lessened and the danger of death from this 
disease is practically over. Many persons escape this 
malady altogether.

CHAPTER XXXVni 

FOOD FOR YOUNG CHILDREN* 

{Caroline L. Hunt.) 

A little child who is carefully fed in accordance with his 
bodily needs (as these are now understood) receives every 
day at least one food from each of the following groups : 

1. Milk and dishes made chiefly of milk (most import- 
ant of the group as regards children's diet) ; meat, fish, 
poultry, eggs, and meat substitutes. 

2. Bread and other cereal foods. 

3. Butter and other wholesome fats. 

4. Vegetables and fruits. 

5. Simple sweets. 

BREAKFAST 

Baked apple (pulp and juice only for the youngest chil- 
dren and for those with whom the skin disagrees) (group 
4) ; cereal mush (group 2) ; milk (group 1) ; toast and but- 
ter (groups 2 and 3). 

DINNER 

Lamb chop (group 1) ; baked potato (group 4) ; spin- 
ach (finely chopped for youngest children) (group 4); 
bread and butter (groups 2 and 3); rice with milk and 
sugar (groups 1, 2, and 5). 

(* Farmers' Bulletin No. 717, "Food for Young Children.") 

543 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



SUPPER 

Milk (group 1 ) ; bread (group 2) ; stewed prunes (pulp 
and juice only for youngest children) (group 4) ; plain 
cookies (omit in case of youngest children) (group 5). 

In these meals (breakfast, dinner, and supper) each of 
the groups is represented by a food which is suitable for a 
little child, each food being numbered to indicate the group 
to which it belongs. The purpose is to show a day's ration 
containing enough different kinds of foods to meet all the 
child's needs. 

Many other meals might have been given, for there is no 
food in the menus, except milk, which could not have been 
replaced by some other wholesome food. Milk, if it can be 
procured, should form part of the food of every child, ex- 
cept when for some special reason the doctor objects, and 
this he seldom does. 

As to the amounts that should be served, a good rule 
is to provide three or four glasses (1^ pints to 1 cjuart ) 
of milk a day; an egg or its ecjuivalent in moderately fat 
meat, fish, poultry, or meat substitute ; fruit and vegetables 
each once a day; 1 to 2 ounces of butter or other wholesome 
fat; and all the bread or other cereal food the child will 
eat. One or two ounces of sugar, candy, or other sweet 
( including the sugar used in cooking) may also be allowed, 
if this does not prevent eating the other foods mentioned. 

The foods shown in the menus are simple and simply 
cooked, but are the kind liked by most healthy children. The 
service should be orderly and neat in every way. This is 
important because it helps to form neat and orderly habits. 

The following bills of fare, like those in the menus, 
are simple, easy to prepare, sufficiently varied, and. if well 
prepared, should taste good. They are so planned that milk 
and another food from group 1 and a food from each of the 
other groups will be served at least once a day.

Though all the foods mentioned in the bills of fare may 
be included under five heads, the diet need not be monoto- 
nous, for many foods come under each class. The differ- 
ent 'groups are described in the pages that follow. 

FOOD GROUP NO. 1.— MILK AND DISHES 
MADE CHIEFLY FROM IT; FISH, POULTRY, 
EGGS, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES. 

The different foods mentioned in the heading of this 
group have enough in common to warrant bringing them 
together. Hovrever, milk is such an important food for 
children that it is desirable to speak of it by itself. 

MILK SERVED IN VARIOUS WAYS 

Milk is the natural food of babies and the most import- 
ant food for young children. A quart of milk a day is a 
good allowance for a child. The greater part of this is 
usually given as a drink or served on cereals or in the form 
of bread and milk. Milk may also be served on fruits that 
are not very acid (baked apples or pears, berries, and 

547 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



others), in soups, gravies, custard, junket, and other pud- 
dings, and may be used in place of water in cooking cereals. 

Milk, being a liquid, is sometimes classed with water, 
tea. and coffee, simply as a beverage, by those who do not 
understand its value as food. This is a great mistake. If 
all the water were to be driven off from a quart of tea or 
coffee, almost nothing would be left, and the little that re- 
mained would have little or no value as food. If, on the 
other hand, the water were driven off from a quart of 
whole milk, there would be left about half a cupful of the 
very best, food substances, including butter fat, a kind of 
sugar not so sweet as granulated sugar and known as "milk 
sugar," and also materials which are needed to make 
muscles, bones, teeth, and other parts of the body. All 
these valuable food substances are ordinarily either dis- 
solved or floating in the water of milk. 

Besides all this nourishment, milk contains a very small 
amount of a substance or substances now thought to help 
the body of the child to make good use of other foods. 
For this reason milk is often called "growth promoting." 
Apparently nothing can serve so well as the basis for the 
diet of the healthy child. 

Good whole milk is desirable, but if a mother is obliged 
to choose between clean milk and rich milk, she had better 
take the clean milk. Best of all, of course, is clean whole 
milk, but if that cannot be obtained it is better to use clean 
fresh skim milk than dirty or questionable whole milk. A 
cjuart of skim milk, even separator skim milk, contains 
about a third of a cupful of solid food, which is nearly all 
there was in the whole milk, except the butter fat. 

When it is absolutely impossible to get fresh milk, con- 
densed, powdered, or evaporated milk may be used, but 
before doing this parents should try in every way to get 
fresh milk for their children. 

Compared with most other foods milk contains much 
lime but very little iron. Spinach and other green vegeta- 
bles and egg yolks are, on the other hand, very rich in 

548 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



iron. This is one reason why combinations of egg yolks 
and milk and of vegetables and milk are mentioned so 
often. 

When milk is given to babies the chill is usually taken 
from it. It is safe to do this for all young children. When 
milk is used as a drink it should be sipped, not gulped down. 

Besides being served as a beverage, milk is often com- 
bined with many other foods, as follows : 

BREAD AND MILK 

This may well be the chief, if not the only, dish in the 
supper of little children, li the milk is not very rich, the 
bread should be spread with butter. Use well-baked bread, 
at least a day old, or toast, or occasionally crackers. 

CEREALS AND MILK 

Thoroughly cooked cereals served once a day for the 
first course and once a day for dessert encourage the use of 
milk. Any cereal may be cooked in milk besides being 
served with it. Skim milk which might otherwise be 
thrown away may be used for the purpose. Rice, cooked 
in an uncovered double boiler, or in a pan in a very slow 
oven, can be made to absorb about six times its volume of 
skim milk. To cook a cupful of rice in this way instead of 
in water may be considered equivalent, so far as tissue- 
forming qualities are concerned, to serving it with half a 
pound of lean beef. 

MILK TOAST 

The following is a good method for making milk toast. 
Put on the table hot crisp toast or twice baked bread and a 
pitcher of hot milk, slightly srlted. One-fourth teaspoonful 
of salt to a cupful of milk is sufficient. Pour the milk over 
the toast as needed, using hot bowls or deep saucers for 
serving. This is the easiest way of serving milk toast, 
and, if care is taken to have all the dishes hot and to salt 

549 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



the milk, it is usually acceptable. A supply of twice-baked 
bread can be kept on hand and heated as needed to crisp it. 

Another way to make milk toast is to thicken milk and 
pour it over toast. For one cupful of milk allow one and 
one-half level teaspoonfuls of flour and one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of salt. Make a smooth paste out of the flour, 
salt, and a little of the milk. Heat the rest of the milk, add 
the flour and milk mixture and boil for about five minutes, 
stirring constantly, or cook twenty minutes in a double 
boiler, stirring constantly at first and frequently later on. 
If skim milk is used, a level teaspoonful of butter or bacon 
fat should be added after the gravy is prepared. 

An easier and quicker method of making the sauce or 
" milk gravy " is to cook the flour thoroughly in a table- 
spoonful of fat before adding the milk. This, however, is 
not thought to be so wholesome as the kind of gravy in 
which the flour is cooked in the milk. 

Milk gravy may be combined with dried beef or salt cod- 
fish which has been cut into small pieces and soaked in 
warm water, or with small pieces of tender meat, chicken, 
fish, or vegetables. Such gravy may be served with toast, 
with baked or boiled potatoes, or with boiled rice or other 
cereals. Dishes of this kind are more suitable for dinner 
than for supper. 

Milk toast with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg grated over 
it makes an attractive dish. The whites of the hard-cooked 
eggs are not suitable for a young child nor for any child 
unless they are finely chopped or unless the child can be 
made to chew them well. 

COCOA 

For variety, milk flavored with cocoa may be served. 
Prepared cocoa is the most convenient, but cracked cocoa 
shells or nibs, which require long boiling, may be used. A 
warm drink, made chiefly of cocoa and water, is not to be 

550 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



confused with the more nourishing drink made by flavor- 
ing milk with cocoa, but it has its uses. Like clear soups, 
which contain little food in themselves, it may lead the 
child to eat freely of bread and other needed foods. 

MILK SOUPS 

Another good way to serve milk to children is in soups. 
Milk-vegetable soups are made from cooked vegetables, 
chopped or strained, which in this form may be given to 
even the voungest children, and milk (whole or skim) 
slightly thickened. The vegetable may be asparagus, peas, 
beans of various kinds, celery, potatoes, turnips, carrots, 
spinach, kale, chard, beet roots or greens, parsnips, lettuce, 
cress, cauliflower, or almost any other. 

GENERAL RECIPE FOR MILK-VEGETABLE SOUPS 

2 cupfuls of milk. 

1 tablespoon ful of flour. 

1 tablespoon ful of butter. 

Salt. 

2/3 a cupful of a thoroughly cooked vegetable, finely 
chopped, mashed, or put through a sieve. 

Thicken the milk with the flour as for milk gravy, 
add the other ingredients. If the soup is too thick, as it 
may be if the vegetable is starchy, thin it with milk or 
water. Milk tomato soup is not recommended for the 
youngest children. When it is served a little soda should 
be added to prevent the milk from curdling. 

MILK STEW 

1 cjuart of milk. 

1 cupful raw potatoes cut into small pieces. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter or bacon fat. 

1 cupful of codfish cut into small pieces or just enough 
to flavor the stew. 

551 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Soak the fish in kikewarm water until it is soft and the 
salt removed. Cook the potatoes in water until tender, 
drain them, add the milk and codfish, and bring to the 
boiling point; add the butter, and salt to taste. 

In place of the codfish any other salt or fresh fish, oysters 
or a little chipped beef may be used. Or the fish may be 
omitted and the soup made savory and palatable by adding 
a few drops of onion juice, or a vegetable cut into small 
pieces and cooked thoroughly. 

CEREAL-MILK PUDDINGS 

Puddings made with milk and bread, rice, or some other 
cereal food, have long been recognized as desirable in the 
child's diet. 

Such milk puddings as old-fashioned rice or Indian 
pudding may be the means of serving much milk in a whole- 
some way. From the following recipe for rice pudding 
other recipes can be easily made, the proportions in all cases 
being about the same : 

RICE PUDDING 

1 quart of milk. 

^cupful of rice. 

Yz cupful of sugar. 

Yi teaspoonful of salt. 

y% teaspoonful of ground nutmeg, or cinnamon, or the 
grated rind of Va^ of a lemon. 

Wash the rice thoroughly, mix the ingredients, and bake 
three hours or more in a very slow oven, stirring occasion- 
ally at first. 

GENERAL RECIPE FOR CEREAL-MILK PUDDINGS 

For a quart of milk allow one-third of a cupful of any 
coarse cereal (rice, corn meal, cracked wheat, oatmeal, or 
barley) and one-third of a cupful of brown, white, or maple 
sugar, syrup, honey, or molasses; one-half teaspoonful of 

552 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



salt; one-eighth teaspoonful of spice. The flavoring may 
be omitted when honey or molasses is used. 

The above recipe makes quite a large pudding. It is 
often convenient to make a smaller one, and enough for a 
child's dinner can be made in the double boiler, allowing 
two level or one rounding tablespoonfuls each of cereal 
and of sugar (or other sweet) to a cupful of salted and 
flavored milk. Cook an hour or more without covering. 

These puddings, if made thin, may be poured over stewed 
prunes or other cooked fruits, and are a good and economi- 
cal substitute for the cream or soft custard usually used for 
that purpose. 

CUSTARD AND OTHER MILK PUDDINGS 

There are many other milk dishes which are used in the 
same way as this milk and cereal pudding. Recipes for 
some of them follow : 

Junket, or " rennet custard," is milk that has been 
coagulated or curdled, a process not unlike one of the 
steps in digestion. The curdling is brought about by the 
addition of " junket tablets '' to the milk. Milk contain- 
ing rennet will, if not disturbed, " set " in one piece re- 
sembling a custard. Junket differs little from milk in food 
value except for the presence of the sugar used for flavor- 
ing, but it gives variety to the diet. H served very cold it 
is refreshing in warm weather. 

.lUNKET 

2 cupfuls of milk. 
j4 cupful sugar, honey, or syrup. 
1 junket tablet. 
Ys teaspoonful of salt. 
A few grains of nutmeg or cinnamon. 
Warm the milk to about the temperature of the body, 
crush the tablet, and add it with the other ingredients to 

553 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



the milk. Pour into one large or several small dishes and 
place in a warm (not hot) place to harden. Cool before 
serving. 

BOILED CUSTARD 

3 egg yolks. 

2 ciipfuls of milk. 

y^ cupful of sugar, honey, or syrup. 

y^ teaspoonful of salt. 

Flavoring. 

Heat the milk in a double boiler. Thoroughly mix the 
eggs and sugar and pour the milk over them Return the 
mixture to the double boiler and heat it until it thickens, 
stirring constantly. Cool and flavor. If the custard curdles 
remove it from the fire and beat with a Dover tgg beater. 
This custard may be served in place of cream on many 
kinds of dessert. 

FLOATING ISLAND 

In this dish the whites of eggs left over from boiled 
custard can be used to serve with it. Beat the whites until 
stiff, sweeten them a little, and cook them in a covered dish 
over water which is hot but not boiling, or cook them on 
top of the hot milk which is to be used in making custard. 
Lift them out with a wire tgg beater or split spoon, and 
place on top of the custard. Decorate with small bits of 
jelly. 

TAPIOCA CUSTARD 

Tapioca custards may be made as follows : Add to the 
list of ingredients for boiled custard one-fourth cupful of 
pearl tapioca. Soak the tapioca in water for an hour or 
two, drain it, and cook in the milk until it is transparent. 
Proceed as for boiled custard. 

554 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



BAKED CUSTARD 

In making allow one egg and two level teaspoonfnls of 
sugar and a few grains of salt and of nutmeg for each cup- 
ful of milk. Beat the eggs slightly and add the other in- 
gredients. Bake in cups set in a pan of water in a moderate 
oven. 

SIMPLE ICE CREAMS 

In the way they are used, ice creams and frozen custard 
may be grouped with the puddings. Plain ice cream made 
out of thin cream, sweetened and flavored, or out of cream 
and custard mixed, may be given to children occasionally. 

A good ice cream may be made as follows : Allow one- 
fourth cupful of sugar to each cupful of thin cream (half 
milk and half cream) ; flavor and freeze. 

A frozen custard, commonly called by housekeepers "ice 
cream" or "French ice cream," which contains eggs as well 
as milk and cream, may be made as follows: For each half 
cupful of milk allow one-fourth cupful of sugar, one or two 
egg yolks or one whole egg, and a half cupful of cream. 
Make a custard out of all the ingredients but the cream. 
When it is cool, flavor it, add the cream, and freeze. 

CARAMEL FLAVORING FOR USE IN CUSTARDS, ICE 
CREAMS, AND OTHER DESSERTS 

An economical flavoring for any of the above desserts 
may be made by browning or caramelizing ordinary sugar. 
To each cupful of sugar add one-fourth of a cupful of 
water. Heat until well browned, stirring constantly, even 
after the dish has been taken from the fire, and until the 
danger of burning in the hot dish is passed. Before the 
mixture hardens, add hot water and cook until it is about 
the consistency of thick syrup. Bottle and save for use 
as needed.

MEAT, FISH, POULTRY, EGGS, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

The other foods incKided in group one with milk (con- 
sidered by far the most important of them ah for children) 
are meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and meat substitutes. 

In some families children do not get enough meat and 
eggs ; in others they get too much. A good general rule com- 
monly followed is to give a child two years old or over, an 
egg every other day and about the same amount (2 ounces) 
of meat, fish, or poultry on the days that come between. If 
for any reason meat is omitted from the child's diet special 
care must be taken to see that other suitable foods take 
its place — preferably an extra amount of milk or eggs. 

Broiling or roasting are the best methods of preparing 
tender meat. Tough meat should be stewed or prepared 
in a fireless cooker, or first chopped and then broiled. 

It is important to teach children to chew meat and other 
foods properly. 

Fried meats, particularly those which are pan fried or 
cooked in a small amount of fat, should not be given to 
young children. One reason for this is that they are 
likely to be overcooked and tough, at least on the out- 
side, and are likely not to be properly chewed and to be 
swallowed in large pieces. Another reason is that the fat 
used in frying and also that w'hich tries out of the meat is 
likely to be scorched and changed in composition. When 
this is the case, it is almost certain to be harmful. 

Some recipes for cooking meat for children follow : 

BROILED CHOPPED MEAT 

Many cuts of meat too tough to be broiled whole may be 
prepared very satisfactorily by being chopped, salted, and 
broiled. Allow about one-half teaspoonful of salt to a 
pound of meat. For very little children the meat should be 
scraped instead of being chopped, for in this w^ay the con- 
nective tissue is taken out. An egg or a litle milk may also 
be added. The most important point is careful handling, 

556 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



for if the meat is pressed together it becomes tough and 
hard. Ha wire broiler is used, the cakes should not be 
scjueezed between the two sides ; to avoid this, lay them on 
top of the broiler and turn them with a knife and fork. 

MEAT STEWS 

Stews made out of meat and vegetables offer a very great 
variety of dishes, good in themselves and good also be- 
cause they encourage the eating of bread. The meat used 
should, of course, be in good condition but need not be from 
a tender cut. The lower-priced cuts may be used with 
good results, provided they are made tender by long, slow 
cooking. Any vegetable may be added, including the 
tougher parts of lettuce and the leaves of celery. Rice, 
barley, macaroni, or even crusts of stale bread may be used 
in the stew to give variety. A stew containing a little 
meat, with one or more vegetables and a cereal, comes near 
to supplying all the needed foods, other than milk. 

MEAT STEW 

2 pounds of one of the cheaper cuts of beef. 

4 cups of potatoes cut into small pieces. 

2-3 cupful each of turnips and carrots cut into half -inch 
cubes. 

y2 onion, chopped. 

^ cupful of flour. 

Salt. 

Cut the meat into small pieces, cover with boiling water, 
boil for five minutes, and then cook at a lower temperature 
until the meat is tender. This will require about three 
hours on the stove or five hours in the fireless cooker. Add 
the carrots, turnips, and onions, and salt during the last 
hour of cooking, and the potatoes twenty minutes before 
serving. Thicken with the flour diluted with cold water. 
H the dish is made in the fireless cooker, the mixture must 
be reheated when the vegetables are put in. 

557 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



There is much to l)e said in favor of keeping a soup pot 
on the stove all the time, provided great care is taken not 
to allow the contents to grow stale. Into this pot can go 
clean portions of uncooked food and also clean foods left 
from the table, such as meat, milk, mashed potatoes, or 
other vegetables, crusts, cold cereal mushes, and even fruits. 
Soups made from such materials may not have great nu- 
tritive value, but, like those made out of materials bought 
for the purpose, they encourage the use of a large amount 
of bread, particularly if carefully seasoned. 

POULTRY 

Chicken or turkey can be used for variety in a child's 
diet and are palatable stewed and served with rice. H 
roast chicken is used, select portions which are tender. 
It is well not to give a young child either highly seasoned 
stuffing (dressing) or rich gravy. 

FISH 

The use of cured fish, fresh fish, and oysters in stews 
has been spoken of above. Boiled or stewed fish is also 
good for variety. 

EGGS 

Eggs are especially useful food for young children. The 
chief point to remember in preparing them for children 
is that they must not be overcooked or they are likely 
to cause indigestion, as experience has shown. Every one 
knows how the heat of cooking hardens the egg, and it is 
easy to understand wiiy the digestive juices might have 
difficulty in penetrating such hard substance as the white 
of a hard-boiled egg. Overcooked yolks are also thought 
to be hard to digest. However, when eggs are cooked in 
the shell, the heat reaches the white before it does the yolk, 
and so there is more danger of the white being overcooked 

558 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



than of the yolk. The best ways of serving eggs for children 
are poached, soft-boiled, or coddled, though they may be 
scrambled for a change if one is careful not to scorch the 
fat used or to overcook the egg. 

CODDLED EGGS 

Many means have been suggested for cooking eggs in 
such a way that the yolks will be cooked and the whites 
will not be overcooked. One of the most satisfactory is by 
coddling and is done as follows : Allow a cupful of water to 
each egg, bring the water to the boiling point, remove it 
from the fire, put in the eggs, cover the dish closely, and 
leave the eggs in the water for about seven minutes. There 
is some uncertainty about this method, for eggs differ in 
weight and also in temperature at the time the cooking 
begins. On the whole, however, this method can be more 
depended on than others. Good results can be obtained by 
pouring hot water over eggs, if the same dish with the 
same amount of water is always used, but each cook must 
make her own rules. 

MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Milk and eggs, as stated above, are common meat sub- 
stitutes. Among vegetable foods, dried beans, peas, len- 
tils, and cowpeas, which are often classed together and 
called legumes, are the best substitutes for meat in the diet 
of older people, chiefly because they have large amounts of 
nitrogen needed for muscle building. In this respect they 
have some advantage, though not a great one, over cereals. 
Beans and the other legumes are not to be recommended 
for voung children except when milk, meat, eggs, fish, and 
poultry are not to be obtained. When used they should be 
cooked until they are reduced to a mush. Since the skins 
are likely to be tough, it is well to put the cooked legumes 
through a sieve. 

559 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



-1 



A general recipe for soups made from beans, peas, len- 
tils, cowpeas, and other legumes follows: 

SOUP FROM DRIED BEANS OR OTHER LEGUMES 

1 cup dried legumes. 

1 quart of water or soup stock. 

2 tablespoonfuls of butter or savory fat. 
2 tablespoonfuls of flour. 

Salt and other flavoring. 

Soak the dried legumes in water overnight. Drain, add 
the water or stock, cook slowly on top of the stove for 
three hours or in fireless cooker for four or five hours, or 
until tender. Renew the water as it boils away. Strain 
and thicken with the fat and flour rubbed together. These 
soups may be flavored in many ways. Sometimes a tomato, 
onion, a few celery tops, a sprig of parsley, or mixture of 
vegetables is boiled with the beans or peas, or just before 
serving a few drops of onion juice, a little celery salt, or 
one-fourth level teaspoonful of curry powder is added. 
Sometimes the water used is that in which ham or other 
meat has been boiled, but in such cases care must be taken 
not to have the liquid too fatty. 

FOOD GROUP No. 2— BREAD AND OTHER CEREAL FOODS 

Cereal foods of some sort are used by children prac- 
ticallv all over the world. Bread is the commonest cereal 
food in this country, though cereal mushes are also very 
generally used. Well-baked bread and thoroughly cooked 
breakfast cereals are both good for children and with milk 
should make up a large part of the diet. These two foods, 
bread and breakfast cereals, provide almost the same kind 
of nourishment. Bread may therefore take the place, to a 
certain extent, of cereal mushes, and cereal mushes may 
take the place of bread, but neither can take the place of 
milk, meat, eggs, fruit, and vegetables. 

560 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



An ordinary slice of bread (a 94-iiich slice cut from an 
ordinary loaf, ) is equal in food value to about half a cupful 
of boiled or steamed cereal and to about a cupful of pulfed 
or flaked cereal. The mother who must feed her child very 
economically should calculate the cost of each and decide 
which is the cheapest. 

The relation of food to the condition of the bowels is 
an important matter. Grains, particularly those containing 
the outer or branny layers or coats, are laxative; so, too, 
are such, mildly acid fruits as apples, oranges and grape- 
fruit. So far, therefore, as the important matter of pre- 
venting constipation is concerned, coarse grains and mildly 
acid fruits serve the same purpose. When fruits are to be 
obtained in abundance, the kind of cereal served is not of 
great importance. When they are not, the coarser cereals 
should be used. In the case of both cereals and fruits, it is 
possible to overdo. Sometimes the coarser parts, such as 
bran and skin, do not agree with the child and, under these 
circumstances, they should be removed from the food 
before it is served. Some mothers find it necessary to 
strain oatmeal porridge, for example, and to remove the 
skins of apples. 

BREAD 

The yeast-raised bread given to young children should be 
at least a day old or should be toasted or twice baked. Most 
hot breads are likely to be swallow^ed in large pieces and are 
therefore not desirable. Hot breads which are almost all 
crust, like thin tea biscuits or crisp rolls, are least likely 
to cause trouble. 

MILK TOAST 

This very common bread dish has been discussed under 
milk. 

561 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



TWICE-BAKED BREAD 

Bread cut or torn into small pieces and heated in a very 
slow oven until thoroughly dried and very delicately 
browned is good food for children. The warming oven of 
a coal stove is al)out hot enough for the piu'pose. In the 
case of gas ovens it is often difificult to get the gas low 
enough without having the door open a little way. The 
advantage of tearing instead of cutting the bread is that 
it makes it lighter in texture and easier to eat. The crust 
can be torn off from all but the ends of the loaf of bread 
in one piece. This crust should be torn into pieces, about 
two inches wide. The inside of an ordinary loaf of bread 
will make sixteen pieces of convenient size. 

Tear first across the loaf and then tear each half into 
eight pieces. It is usually necessary to make a small cut first 
in order to start the tearing. It is well to keep the crusts 
separate, as otherwise they are likely to get too brown. 
Such bread will need to be reheated before serving unless 
it is kept in a warm place, like a warming oven. 

The above is also a good way to use stale bread. Some 
people crush it and use it with milk as a breakfast food. 

BREAKFAST CEREALS 

Cereal mushes and other breakfast cereals are very com- 
mon foods. Almost all of the well-known grains are used 
for this purpose, and there are many such products, owing 
to differences in manufacture. 

Except when used for dessert, cereal mushes and ready- 
to-eat cereals should be served with milk and with very 
little, if any, sugar. If the cereals are heavily sw'eetened, 
children are likely to eat so much that they neglect other 
and much-needed foods. If carefully salted, mushes are 
more likely to satisfy the taste without sugar than other- 
wise. Well-cooked cereals with milk or stewed fruit or a 
little molasses, syrup, honey, or sugar make good desserts

for dinner, lunch, or supper, li preferred, dried fruits, 
like dates and raisins, may be cooked with the cereal to 
sweeten it and to give flavor. 

COOKING CEREAL BREAKFAST FOODS 

It is hard to give general rules for cooking cereals, for 
there are so many kinds, but it is safe to say that there is 
no danger of overcooking and much danger of undercook- 
ing them. Some grains need longer cooking than others — 
corn meal, for example, needs at least three hours and rice 
hardly more than half an hour. In general, whole grains, 
like whole wheat, or grains more or less finely broken, like 
cracked wheat, recjuire longer cooking (three hours at least J 
than more finely ground grains, such as farina (which 
should be cooked one hour at least. ) Breakfast foods made 
from grains with the outer coverings left on require more 
cooking than those with the outer covering removed — whole 
barley, for example, more than pearl barley. 

Many cereal foods, particularly the rolled and flaked 
types, have been partially cooked at the factory. These 
require less cooking in the home than those which have 
had no such treatment; but if they are to be served to 
children such cereals should be cooked at home for at least 
an hour. There are also cereal breakfast foods which have 
been still more thoroughly cooked at the factory, either by 
parching in addition to flaking or by some other special 
method. These are improved by putting them into the 
oven long enough at least to crisp them. 

Oatmeal, corn meal, and many other granular cereals 
can be put directly into cold water and cooked satisfactorily 
in a double boiler without stirring, the method being parti- 
cularly good in the case of corn meal, which is likely to be 
lumpy if stirred into hot water. A convenient method for 
cooking cereals is to mix with the usual quantity of water, 
bring to the boiling point, boil for three or four minutes, 
and then put into the fireless cooker and leave ten or twelve 

563 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



hours. Porridge or mush made in this way must be reheated 
before serving. 

The quantity of water required dilTers with the cereal. 
A cupful of rolled oats requires at least two cupfuls of 
water, oatmeal or corn meal, four cupfuls; and rice, three 
cupfuls. 

A level teaspoonful of salt to a cupful of cereal will 
usually be right, but it is well to experiment a little with an 
unfamiliar cereal, since failure to salt mushes properlv very 
often leads children to dislike them. 



FOOD GROUP No. 3— BUTTER, CREAM, TABLE OIL, AND 
OTHER FATTY FOODS 

Fat is an important part of the food of children. This is 
not surprising for it is found in considerable amounts in 
human milk, the natural food for babies. Butter, which 
consists chiefly of separated milk fat, and cream, which is 
rich in milk fat and also in the other nourishing substances 
of milk, are both wholesome. Salad oils of various kinds 
(olive, cotton-seed, peanut, and others) may be given to 
children in small amounts. Those who are not used to table 
oil must often be trained to like it. This can usually be 
done by introducing it very gradually into the diet. 

A good way to serve it is on spinach and other greens or 
on tender salad vegetables. 

There is more than an ounce of fat (at least 2^^ level 
tablespoonfuls ) in a quart of whole milk. H the healthy 
child is given a cpiart of milk, has butter on its bread, and 
meat or an egg once a day, he gets enough fat and that 
which he receives is in wholesome form. It is well, there- 
fore, not to give such fatty foods as pastry, fried meats 
and vegetables, and doughnuts or rich cakes, for in these 
the fats are not in so good a form for children, as exper- 
ience has shown. H the child is constipated, the occasional 
use of cream or salad oil is desirable, for fat in abundance 
is laxative. 

564 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Bacon or salt pork, cut very thin and carefully cooked, 
mav be given occasionally, but thick pieces with much lean 
are not desirable. In preparing bacon or salt pork it is very 
important not to burn the fat. To avoid this they should 
be cooked in one of the following ways: Put the slices on 
a broiler or wire frame over a pan ; place the pan in a hot 
oven and cook long enough to remove most of the fat. Or 
keep a pan on purpose for cooking bacon on top of the 
stove and let the fat which fries out of it collect in the 
pan. taking care that none is burned. In time so much fat 
will collect that bacon can be dropped into this hot fat and 
will be less likely to burn than if placed on a hot pan. 

FOOD GROUP No. 4— VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 

Two very valuable kinds of food are here grouped 
together, namely, vegetables and fruits. This is done be- 
cause they are similar in that both kinds supply iron, lime 
and other mineral matter to the body, and also mild acids 
(not always in such amounts that one can taste them), such 
as those which are found in oranges, apples, and tomatoes. 

Vegetables are an important but often a neglected part 
of a child's diet. They should be served at least once a 
day, as they help to keep the bowels in good condition. 
Several of the ways of accustoming the child to the taste 
of unfamiliar vegetables have already been suggested here. 
They may be used as flavoring for meats and stews, may 
be added to milk or meat stews, or served with meat gravy. 
If gravy is used, it should not be too fat nor made with 
scorched fat. 

Young children may be given the young and tender parts 
of celery and lettuce, a satisfactory way of serving being in 
the form cf sandwiches. For this purpose they should be 
slightly salted and the celery should be chopped or cut into 
small pieces. 

All vegetables, whether served raw or cooked, should be 
washed with great care. Large vegetables like potatoes and 

565 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



carrots should be scrubbed with a brush. Greens should 
be washed leaf by leaf under running water, or in a large 
amount of water. In the latter any sand which clings to 
them is likely to sink. To prevent it from again getting on 
the vegetables lift them from the water instead of pouring 
the water off. 

Most vegetables when served as a separate dish should be 
either steamed, boiled, baked, or stewed. If the supply of 
fresh vegetables is not generous, the juice in which they 
are cooked should be used with them as far as possible, or 
put into soups or stews. 

Experience has shown that vegetables, particularly green 
vegetables are at their best when cooked until tender, but 
not until completely wilted. Spinach requires cooking from 
twenty to thirty minutes. 

Vegetables should be served either quite simply or with 
a little milk, cream, or butter, to improve or vary the flavor. 
As said before, oil may be served on greens instead of 
butter. These simple methods are better than complicated 
ones like frying or scalloping. For the smallest children 
such vegetables as greens should be finely chopped, and if 
the tougher portions of other vegetables, the skins of green 
peas, for example, are found to disagree with a child, these 
portions should be removed by putting the cooked vegetable 
through a sieve. No such vegetables as raw radishes or 
cucumbers, which might easily be swallowed in large pieces, 
should be given to small children. 

Fruits, which with vegetables make up group 4, are also 
very important in the child's diet. They supply mild acids, 
and they are important for their flavor, for their laxative 
effects, and no doubt for other reasons also. The laxative 
effect is well recognized in the very general use of orange 
juice, prunes and apples. Then, too, the fruits, like the 
vegetables, have mineral elements which the body re- 
quires. 

Frviits should be served in some forms at least once a 
day. In general, the same rule should be followed as for 

566 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



vegetables in deciding in what form they should be served. 
Fruit juices and the pulp of cooked fruit, baked apples and 
pears, and stewed prunes, for example, are safest. Whether 
the skins should be given depends partly on the age and 
health of the child and partly on the way the fruit is pre- 
pared. H the skins are very tender, they are not likely to 
cause trouble, except with very young children. When 
apples and pears are baked the skins can be made tender 
by frequent bastings. 

FOOD GROUP No. 5— SIMPLE SWEETS 

Simple sweets are such things as lump sugar, maple 
sugar, syrups, honey, and plain candy, and those foods in 
which sugar is combined in simple forms with fruit juices 
(in lemonade, water ice, jelly, etc.), with flour or starch, 
as in plain cakes (cup cake, sponge cake, cookies), and with 
fruit, as in jams, marmalades, and in similar things. Sweets 
which contain much fat, like rich cakes and pastry, and 
foods which are made rich with nuts or dried or candied 
fruits, or those which are highly flavored or spiced, can 
not be classed as simple sweets. 

Sugar is a desirable part of the diet, and the only objec- 
tion which can be raised to its use in reasonable amounts 
in a mixed diet is that it is sometimes allowed to take the 
place of foods whch come under the first four groups men- 
tioned in this bulletin, and so spoils the child's appetite for 
those other important things. Under these conditions it is 
harmful, because its improper use has led to bad habits. 
Sweets should not be given between meals or during the 
first course of a meal. Careful mothers who forbid their 
children eating candy at odd times sometimes give one or 
two pieces of wholesome candy as a " treat " with dessert 
at dinner,

In the foregoing pages some general principles which

facts given about foods the child should have and about 
cooking them. 

At the close of the day the mother might ask herself 
questions like the following to make sure that she has taken 
into account the things to which her attention has been 
directed. 

Did the child take about a quart of milk in one form or 
another ? 

Have I taken pains to see that the milk that comes to 
my house has been handled in a clean way ? 

HI was obliged to serve skim milk for the sake of 
cleanliness or economy, did I supply a little extra fat in 
some other way? 

Were the fats which I gave the child of the wholesome 
kind found in milk, cream, butter, and salad oils, or of the 
unwholesome kind found in doughnuts and other fried 
foods ? 

Did I make good use of all skim milk by using it in 
preparation of cereal mushes, puddings, or otherwise? 

Were all cereal foods thoroughly cooked? 

Was the bread soggy? li so, was it because the loaves 
were too large, or because they were not cooked long 
enough ? 

Did I take pains to get a variety of foods from the cereal 
group by serving a cereal mush once during the day? 

Did I keep in mind that while cereals are good foods in 
themselves, they do not take the place of meat, milk, eggs, 
fruit, and vegetables? 

Did I keep in mind that children who do not have plenty 
of fruit and vegetables need whole wheat bread and whole 
grains served in other ways? 

Did each child have an egg or an equivalent mount of 
meat. fish, or poultry? 

Did any child have more than this of flesh foods or 
eggs? H so. might the money not have l)een better spent 
for fruits and vegetables? 

568 



THE H O U S E K E E P P: R 



II 1 was unable to get milk, meat, fish, poultry, or eggs, 
did I serve dried beans, or other legumes thoroughly cooked 
and carefully seasoned? 

Were vegetables and fruits both on the child's bill of 
fare once during the day? If not. was it because we have 
not taken pains to raise them in our home garden ? 

Did either the fruit or the vegetable disagree with the 
child? If so, ought I to have cooked it more thoroughly, 
chopped it more finely, or have removed the skins or seeds? 

Was the child given sweets between meals, or anything 
that tempted him to eat when he was not hungry? 

Was he allowed to eat sweets when he should have 
been drinking milk or eating cereals, meat, eggs, fruit, or 
vegetables ? 

Were the sweets given to the child simple, i.e., unmixed 
with much fat or with hard substances difficult to chew, 
and not highly flavored ? 

Was the child made to eat slowly and chew his food pro- 
perly ? 

A young child may be considered well fed if he has plenty 
of milk, bread, and other cereal food; an egg once a day 
or its ecjuivalent in flesh foods ; a small amount each of 
carefully prepared fruits and vegetables, with a small 
amount of sweet food after his appetite for other foods is 
satisfied. If there is too much or too little of any of these, 
his diet is one-sided.

CHAPTER XXXIX 

CLEANING 

Proper arrangement of equipment in the kitchen is 
essential to easy, quick and satisfactory work. In general, 
the furniture at one side of the room should be placed as 
follows : storage for food supplies, table, stove and serving 
surface. At the other side of the room should be placed 
the sink having a stacking space at the right and draining 
space at the left, with shelves or closet for keeping dishes 
between meals. All cupboards should have doors to keep 
dust from the contents. 

The small tools should be kept near the place where they 
are to be used, the paring knives, scrubbing brushes, soap, 
etc., near the sink; egg-beater, measuring cups, spoons near 
the work table ; pancake turner, holders, asbestos mats near 
the stove. 

Another important consideration is that of having all 
working surfaces of proper height. A sink that is too low 
will make dish washing a drudgery. Have a high stool at 
hand as many tasks may be done while sitting. 

THE KITCHEN RANGE 

Coal Range. — When buying a range select one of the 
most suitable size for the needs of the family. A com- 
bination coal and gas range is very convenient. Select a 
stove with little or no nickel trimming and one that sets 
on the floor rather than one with legs, as dirt collects under 
the latter. The stove should be placed upon a sheet of 
zinc. 

The ordinary kitchen range has the following essential 
parts : 

571 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Firebox. — The top opens into the air space over the oven 
and it is divided by a grate The fuel is placed upon the 
grate and beneath is the ash box. The grate which divides 
the firebox is movable so that the whole fire may be dropped 
into the ashpan. 

Oven. — This is beside the firebox and both the firebox and 
oven are surrounded by a larger box which forms the out- 
side of the range, with air spaces called flues between. 

Dampers. — Chimney damper which when closed nearlv 
shuts ofif the opening into the chimney. When this damper 
is closed the heat passes around the oven and heats it, when 
this damper is open the heat goes up the chimnev. 

Draff. — The lower draft is below the firebox and when 
open allows a current of air to pass up through the fuel 
causing the fire to burn rapidly. 

Check. — A small door above the firebox which when 
open lets cold air on the fire, forcing the heat back and 
deadening the blaze. 

Heater Connection. — This consists of coils of pipe or 
metal front for water in the firebox — the other sides of the 
firebox are made of firebrick. 

To Build a Fire.~ln starting a fire lay paper (crumpled) 
on the grate, over this place kindling wood, light the fire 
from underneath, when it burns well add a little coal. There 
must be free circulation of air through the fuel. 

Air entering the stove under the fire makes the fire burn 
faster. 

Air entering over the fire checks it. 

To heat the oven, close the chimney damper after the 
fire is well started. 

Keep the air space above the oven free from ashes and 
coal, empty the ashpan daily. 

Clean the top of the range by washing with hot water to 
which a little washing soda is added. The range may be 
kept in good condition without blacking it by rubbing it 
fre{|uently when warm, but not hot, with a cloth on which 

572 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



there is some animal fat as lard, or the cloth may be wet 
with kerosene. Care of course must be taken that the stove 
is cool enough so that there will be no danger from fire. 
Stove polish should be mixed with turpentine instead of 
water to make it stay on. 

To rcz'k'c the fire in the kiteheii range, put on a few tea- 
spoonfuls of sugar. \Vhen it burns up add more coal. 

To obtain more heat from coal, sprinkle some water on 
it. Wet coal burns better and gives more heat — that is, 
provided you get your fire started before you put the wet 
coal into it. 

THE GAS RANGE 

Select a range with oven high enough so that it will not 
be necessary to stoop to light it. The oven may be at the 
side, above or below the top burners. 

The flame for heating is usually below the oven and just 
below' this is the space for broiling oven. Both ovens are 
surrounded by a steel case. 

The heat and odors from the oven should be carried 
to the chimney by a connection at the top of the stove. 

The gas range has from four to six burners with a rack 
above to hold the cooking utensils. There is also a small 
burner for simmering. Burners are removable so that they 
may be cleaned. They have an opening to admit air and 
this has to be adjusted to obtain the right mixture of air 
and gas. 

There is a removable pan under the burners. 

Each burner is connected by a pipe to the front of the 
range where the flow of gas is controlled by a stop-cock. 

To light a gas burner, strike a match and hold it away 
from the stove, open the cock in the burner and apply the 
match. If the match is applied before the stop-cock is 
opened the gas is liable to light back in the pipe. In this 
case turn ofT the gas and light again.

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Gas should burn with a blue flame. If it burns with a 
yellow flame and makes a roaring noise it has too much air 
and the air valve in the pipe needs closing. To clean the 
gas burners, remove and boil them in soda and water. 
Clean the pan under the burners daily. Wipe the stove 
with newspaper and rub over with an oily cloth. 

Do not waste gas, when food boils turn the flame low, do 
not use a small saucepan on a large burner, plan to bake as 
many things as possible while the oven is hot. 

To light the gas oven, open both doors — this is important. 
Open the pilot cock which usually is between the other two 
cocks and apply the lighted match through the hole into the 
oven. Open both oven cocks and when both are burning 
turn off the pilot and close the oven doors. It will require 
eight to ten minutes for heating the oven, when one burner 
may be turned down or entirely off. 

THE ELECTRIC RANGE 

This seems to be the ideal range for cooking but in most 
cities the cost of the electric current for heating bars it 
from the average home. The electric range is not more 
expensive than an up-to-date coal or gas range, there is no 
dirt from the fuel and the heat may be regulated in an 
instant. 

THE REFRIGERATOR 

Select a refrigerator of the size proper for your needs. 
See that the walls are well insulated, allowing a tempera- 
ture of 40 to 45 degrees and that there is space for a good 
circulation of air currents. Choose a refrigerator with a 
smooth non-absorbent lining that will be easy to clean. 

The refrigerator should drain into a large pan under- 
neath, the contents of the pan should be emptied da'ly. 
Care of the Refrigerator. 

1. Wipe the shelves at once if any food is spilled. 

2. Examine the contents daily to be sure that no bit of 
food is left to spoil or mold. 

577 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



3. Hot food should not be put into the refrigerator, it 
raises the temperature and wastes the ice. 

4. No food with strong odor as cabbage, onions or 
bananas should be kept in the refrigerator. 

5. Do not use the ice chamber for food, it is no c..lder 
there than in the next compartment if the cir:ulation is 
right. 

6. Keep the doors closed tightly. 

7. To get the best results keep the ice chamber full of 
ice. The air in the box is then kept cold all of the time. 

To Clean 

A refrigerator should be thoroughly cleaned once a week. 

Remove all food and ice, take out the shelves and racks. 

Use hot water to which is added some washing soda 
(do not put the hands into soda water ) and scrub the shelves 
and racks thoroughly with a brush. Put them in the sun 
to dry. 

Scrub the walls and lloor'of the refrigator being care- 
ful to clean all corners. 

Clean the waste pipe with a long handled brush which 
may be purchased for this purpose or with a stick having 
a cloth wound around it. 

Rinse out the inside of the refrigerator with clear hot 
water and leave open to dry, wipe off the outside with a 
damp cloth. 

Replace the racks, ice, and the food placed on clean 
dishes. 

To keep the ice box sweet smelling place a piece of char- 
coal on one of the shelves. 



THE KITCHEN SINK 

Kitchen sinks are usually porcelain, porcelain lined, soap- 
stone or iron. 

578 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



The porcelain sink is attractive and durable if used with 
care, but expensive. It is easily cleaned but needs c(3n- 
stant atention. It nuist be cleaned v\^ith kerosene, Bon Ami, 
Dutch Cleanser or some similar frictional cleaner. 

The porcelain lined sink is less expensive but chips easily. 

Soapstone makes an inexpensive sink, but it is absorbent 
and hard to clean. Clean with hot soapy water and then 
oil. 

The iron sink rusts easily and becomes rough. It should 
be scrubbed frequently and greased often to prevent rust- 
ing. After greasing always w^ash with sal soda solution to 
remove grease from the pipes. 

If the sink is rough rub with beef or nuitton fat, cover 
with quicklime and leave over night. In the morning wash 
thoroughly with soda solution. 

Care of the Sink. — Keep a strainer in the sink and pour 
all the water through this. 

The sink should l)e thorough cleaned each day. 

When the dish-washing is finished wash the sink with 
clean, hot, soapy w^ater and wipe off the faucets and tiling 
around the sink. Rinse with clear, hot water followed by 
plenty of cold water so that only clean water will be left 
standing in the pipes. 

Once a week tiush the pipes with a strong solution of 
washing soda ( sal soda ) using half a cupful of soda to three 
quarts of water. This will dissolve the grease which may 
have collected in the pipes. Lastly rinse with clear hot 
water followed by cold water. If there should be a stop- 
page of the pipes caused by grease, make the soda solution 
four times as strong. 

To prevent frozen pipes after shutting off the water, pour 
one quart of molasses into the trap, it drives the water out 
and will not freeze. 

579 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



DISH WASHING 

Preparation: — Scrape all food from dishes and rinse 
plates and cups. Soak in cold water all dishes which have 
been used for eggs, milk and starchy foods, and in hot 
water all dishes used for sugary foods. 

Pile all dishes of a kind together at the right of the 
sink. Put silver knives, forks and spoons together. 

Wipe greasy dishes with soft paper. 

Order of Washing. 

Glasses and glassware, cups, silver, plates, larger dishes, 
greasy dishes, cooking utensils. 

Materials. 

Have ready two dish pans; one half full of hot soapy 
water, the other half full of clear hot water. 

Wire drainer. 

Soap, Dutch Cleanser or Bon Ami, bath brick. 

Dish cloths. 

Dish towels. 

Deep saucepan for silver. 

Place the rinsing pan at the left of the dish pan. 

Wash the dishes carefully, rinse in the clear hot water 
and stand in the drainer or dip the drainer filled with dishes 
into the pan of very hot water. A quick wiping with a 
clean towel will be sufficient for drying if the rinsing water 
is very hot. Cups and deep dishes should be inverted in 
the drainer. 

Be sure that the towels are clean and dry. 

Glass — Wash with hot soapy water and dry at once. 

Cut glass — Wash in warm water to which a few drops of 
ammonia is added. Rinse in warm water and dry at once. 
Do not use very hot water as breakage is often due to 
quick change in temperature. To make cut glass shine put 
blueing in the water in which it is rinsed. 

Silver — Wash kinds separately in hot soapy water, rinse 
and dry at once. Do not let the knives with wooden or 
ivory handles remain in water as this loosens the handles 
and turns ivory dark. 

580 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



When all of the serving dishes are washed, do the cook- 
ing utensils. 

Scour the steel knives by placing them on a scouring 
board, rub some bathbrick on a cork which has been damp- 
ened in water and scour the knives until all stains are re- 
moved. Rinse and dry at once. 

If forks smell of fish add a spoonful of mustard to the 
dish water. 

Cooking Utensils. — Scrape bits of food from the utensils 
fill with water in which some washing powder or washing 
soda is dissolved and place on the stove to boil. Wash, rinse 
and dry. 

After cooking onions wash the pan in soap and water 
and then again in vinegar. 

To clean agateware, soak and remove stains by scouring 
with Sapolia or Dutch Cleanser, or put one tablespoonful 
of soda in the dish filled with water and boil it until the dish 
is bright. 

To Clean Aluminum. — Boiling with clean water and 
scraping with a wooden spoon will remove food from alum- 
inum. Do not use soap powder or ammonia. A little acid 
in the water will brighten it ; use one tablespoonful oxalic 
acid crystals in a gallon of water, boil five minutes, wash 
and rinse in clean water. 

Tinware. — Wash clean and dry thoroughly to prevent 
rusting. 

If cooking utensils become yellow scour them with 
baking soda. 

Egg beaters. — Do not wet the cogs of the Dover egg- 
beater. Wash it as soon as used. 

Woodenware. — Wash in hot, soapy water, rinse and dry, 
leave in the sun to dry thoroughly. If any odors are re- 
tained in the wood they may be removed by soaking the 
utensil in water to which soda has been added in the propor- 
tion of one teaspoonful of soda to one quart of water. 

581 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Tea and coffee pots should l)e rinsed in cold water, 
washed thoroughly in hot water, scalded, dried and left 
open. 

Milk bottles. — As soon as empty, fill them with cold 
water. Wash in hot soapy water, rinse and invert to dry. 
Never use milk hottles for anything but milk. 

Wash out the dish pans and dry. Keep them hanging 
underneath or near the sink. 

Wash the dish towels once a day, dry out of doors if 
possible. The towels should ])e l)oiled once a w^ek or 
oftener. 

TO CLEAN SILVER 

The t|uickest way to clean silver is by decomposing the 
tarnish by electricity. To do this fill a dish pan half full 
of hot water, for every quart of water add one teaspoonful 
of washing soda or baking soda and one tablespoonful of 
salt. In the bottom of the pan place an aluminum dish, any 
small piece of aluminum will do. Place the silver to be 
cleaned in the pan, it must rest on the aluminum and be 
covered with the solution. Heat the water although it is 
not necessary to have the water boil. A mild current of 
electricity is set up which causes the tarnish to disappear. 
Remove the silver to a pan of clear, hot water, rinse and 
dry with a soft cloth. This method cleans the silver per- 
fectly. If you wish a higher polish rub the silver with a 
chamois skin. 

To clean the inside of a silver teapot, make a paste of 
soda, vinegar and flour, cover the inside of the teapot and 
leave it over night. 

TO CLEAN BRASS AND COPPER. 

Acids clean brass and copper readily, but unless all traces 
of the acid is removed at once the metal will tarnish. 

Wash the article to be cleaned. Mix salt and vinegar in 
a saucer, dip a soft cloth in this and rub the surface until 
the tarnish is removed. Wash thoroughly and wipe dry.

If the article has a thick coating of tarnish, (hssolve J/j 
ounce of oxahc acid in one pint of soft water and wash the 
brass, then moisten a cloth in sweet oil, dip it in powdered 
whiting or rotten stone, and scour. 

TO CLEAN NICKLE 

Mix equal (piantities of alcohol and household ammonia 
and stir in whiting to the consistency of thin cream. Apply 
with a ])rush or soft cloth, let dry. and polish with a clean, 
dry cloth or chamois skin. 

TO CLEAN ZINC 

If used for table toj), remove stains l)v rubbing with a 
cloth wet with vinegar. Scour with bathbrick or Sapolio, 
rinse and wii)e dry. 

If zinc is on the floor, clean it with kerosene, using a 
small amount on a soft cloth. 

TO THOROUGHLY CLEAN A ROOM 

WEEKLY CLEANING 

Remove the rugs and clean them out of docM's if possible. 

Shake the curtains, remove them, or roll them up and

on the floor sweep it or clean with a carpet sweeper, using 
a whisk broom in the corners. Wipe the carpet with a 
cloth wrung from ammonia and water. If there is a hard 
wood floor, sweep with a soft brush and wipe with a slightly 
oiled cloth. 

Wipe the woodwork with a slightly oiled cloth. 

Wash the windows and globes of lighting fixtures. 

Clean the rugs. To brighten them scatter salt or bits of 
wet newspaper on the rugs ; then sweep them.

SWEEPING AND DUSTING 

Utensils and Materials. 

Vacuum Cleaner. — The easiest and most sanitary method 
of cleaning. 

Broom. — Use both sides evenly. Hang free from the 
floor. 

Brush. — Short handled soft bristle brush. 

Dry Mop 

Dust Pan. 

Carpet Szceeper. 

Dust Cloths. — Patent dusters or cheese cloth. 

JJ'ax for Hard-wood Floors. — Shellac or varnish alone 
makes a tough and durable finish, but on account of its high 
gloss it readilv mars and scratches, and these defects are 
very apparent. A shellac surface cannot be touched up in 
spots because the brush marks will show. So it is custom- 
ary to follow the shellac with a protective coat of wax. A 
suitable wax properly applied gives a hard, glossy surface, 
is not sticky, and does not rub off. Scratches or mars on 
any part of the surface can be waxed over at any time, and 
the whole surface can be repolished with a weighted brush. 
Floor oils, unless rubbed and polished with great care, tend 
to stain skirts, rugs, and draperies. Hence wax is the 
most satisfactory of all floor dressings. 

Care of U\i.ved Floor. — Sweep with a soft brush, rub 
spots with kerosene, and polish with a weighted brush. 

Care of Linoleum. — Sweep, wipe with a damp cloth, using 
soap, if necessary, or use kerosene in the water, li linoleum 
is varnished when new it will last much longer.

Care of tlir Carpet. — To clean thoroughl}-, sweep with 
a broom (keeping broom on the floor at the end of each 
stroke to prevent dust tlying. ) Be careful to clean corners 
and edges thoroughly. Brush with the carpet sweeper. 
Wipe with a cloth dampened with ammonia and water. 

Care of Riu/s. — Before sweeping, rugs should be removed 
from the room and thoroughly cleaned before they are re- 
turned to the floor. H rugs are caught by the ends and 
shaken they sot^n tear out and unraxel. A better wax is to 
hang them on a line and beat them with a carpet beater. 

To Lay Matting. — Before laying matting, cover the floor 
with se\'eral thicknesses of newspaper or carpet paper. 
Matting is porous and lets the dust through. The paper 
catches this and admits of its being easily removed at house- 
cleaning time. Paper also protects the matting from un- 
even edges of the boards of the floor. 

Matting mav l)e tacked down with ordinary carpet tacks 
or double-pointed brads. 

Or the different breadths may be sewed together wdth 
strong linen or cotton thread, using loose buttonhole stitches 
an inch or an inch and a half apart. 

TO CLEAN MATTING ON THE FLOOR 

Matting should not be washed or scrubbed with soapy 
water, as dampness is injurious to it. It may be swept 
with a broom previously dipped in hot water, and after- 
wards gone over with a flannel cloth or sponge dipped in 
salt and water. The salt will freshen the colors and prevent 
the matting from turning yellow. It should be quicky dried 
with a second cloth before the w^ater soaks in. 

To Brighten Matting. — If light-colored mattings become 
stained and faded, wash with strong soda water. This will 
give them a uniform solid cream color, harmonizing the 
different tints. 

Unfinished JJ\wd Floors. — These require scouring to re- 
move dirt from the cracks and pores of the w^ood. Use a

small amount of water and plenty of scouring powder. 
Scrub with a stiff brush, using a circular motion. Dry with 
the grain of the wood. 

TO CLEAN WOODWORK AND FURNITURE 

To Clean Paint. — To clean paint and varnish, whiting. 
Fuller's earth, kerosene, soda, ammonia, turpentine, and 
bran water are all recommended. Do not use much soap or 
washing powders containing free alkali to clean paint. Soap 
tends to streak or to remove paint. Keep the water warm, 
but not hot, and change frequently. Use a flannel cloth or 
chamois, as cotton leaves lint, which sticks to the paint. 

Old underwear is good for washing woodwork. Wood- 
work should be wiped off with a damp cloth, and it will be 
improved by a thorough washing several times a year. If 
woodwork is too dry, it tends to shrink. 

For stains on the polished table, rub the stained part well 
with linseed oil and then hold a hot flat iron two or three 
inches above the spot and it will soon disappear. 

For spots on the floor, wash the stained spot with cold 
water and cover with baking soda. When dry, wash off 
the soda and all traces of stain. 

For peneil-niarked zvoodivork, rub the spots with fresh 
cut lemon, then use whiting on a soft cloth. 

To zvash mission furniture use warm water, and when 
dry, polish with a little good oil. 

To remove a scratch from mahogany, rub the scratch 
with the meat of a pecan nut and it will darken the spot. 

A good piano polish is made from a mixture of one 
part turpentine and two parts olive oil. 

FOR FINISHED WOODS— VARNISHED OR 
SHELLACKED SURFACES 

Avoid alcohol, water and alkali as ammonia and soda. 
Rub with a cloth moistened with kerosene. This method 
used on furniture will cause light scratches and surface

bruises to disappear. But if furniture polish containing 
fixed oils is used the furniture must be rubbed vigorously 
and kept in condition by frequent rubbing to prevent oil 
accumulating so as to be felt or seen. Eurniture oil should 
be sparin.gl}- used and the wood rubljed to a high polish or 
until it does not have anv greasv feelino". 



TO CLEAN CANE CHAIRS AND WICKER, 
BAMBOO AND R.\TTAN FURNITURE 

Remove the dust by using the blower adjustment on the 
vacuum cleaner; if this is not possible, brush with a whisk 
broom to remove the dust. This will greatly assist in clean- 
in.g. Make a suds by dissolving half a bar of Ivory soap in 
a gallon or more of water and add half a cupful of common 
salt. This will prevent the cane from turning yellow. 
Apply the suds to the chair with a scruljbing Inrush, first 
one side and then the other, using plenty of water so that 
the cane may be thoroughly soaked. Place it out of doors 
to dry in a shady place. This will make the cane firm and' 
tight and renew its elasticity. 

GREASE SPOTS 

Grease spots and stains may be removed from stuffed 
furniture bv the use of gasoline. Stuffed furniture may be 
cleaned by rubbing on bran with a flannel cloth, then brush- 
ing thoroughly. 

Grease spots may be removed from leather furniture by 
applying white of an egg to the stain and allowing this to 
dry in the sun. 

DUSTING 

There are two kinds oi dust, living and lifeless. For the 
most part, dust is made up of earth or other matter in such 
small particles that it can be carried by the wind. It is 
present everywhere. Carried in this lifeless dust we find

a living, invisible dust, called germs or microbes. These 
germs are the smallest living plants, and are the sources of 
danger from dust. For the most part dust is unsightly. It 
should be removed from furniture by being taken up in a 
cloth and then the cloth should be shaken out of doors. 
Never keep stirring the dust into the air, only to settle on 
some other article. 

Dusting with an oiled cloth benefits wood, leather and 
metal, a damp cloth is best for any painted surfaces. 

First dust places where air currents enter, as window 
sills, then dust higher articles, reserving the lower ones for 
the last. 

CLEANING WINDOWS 

Ventilate the house while washing or cooking, so that 
the steam may escape before condensing; this helps to keep 
the windows clean. 

Dust the window pants, clean the woodwork. To wash 
with Bon Ami apply with water to make an even paste on 
the glass. Allow to dry and rub off with soft paper or cloth. 
This is a quick method, but the fine powder from the soap 
fiies about the room. 

To wash zmth liquid cleanser. — Use warm water ^^■itll 
soap or a little kerosene. Dry and polish. Alcohol is good 
for cleaning windows in winter. Paint may be removed 
from the glass by using turpentine. 

Avoid streaks on the glass caused by letting water run 
down the pane or by using an excess of soap. 

TO CLEAN MIRRORS AND PICTURE GLASS 

Clean with alcohol or with ammonia and water; do not 
let it run under the frame. Dry and polish with a soft cloth. 
A stain on the mirror may be removed with a flannel cloth 
dampened in camphor.

CARE OF THE CELLAR 

This part of the house should have a thorough cleaning 
twice a year. The furnace and pipes should be cleaned in 
the spring and should be left in good condition so that a 
little fire may be built in damp weather. 

A small amount of quick lime allowed to stand in a 
metal dish in the cellar will absorb moisture. 

Do not alow any decayed leaves or tops of vegetables to 
remain in the vegetable cellar. This place should be con- 
stantly watched and thoroughly cleaned at the end of the 
season. Remove at once any vegetables unfit for use. 

Sweep the cellar frequently. 

TO THOROUGHLY CLEAN THE CELLAR 

Sweep the walls and ceiling, brush dust from tables and 
other articles, sweep part of the floor, remove all articles to 
the clean side and sweep the other part of the floor. Replace 
all articles and dust again, wash shelves and tables, wash 
the windows. Whitewash the walls if necessary. 

The cellar should be aired daily. In the summer air it 
at night; the hot air during the day causes moisture to col- 
lect on the walls. 

WHITEWASHING 

Before applying whitewash, go over the wall or ceiling 
with a brush or dust cloth to remove dust, and wash with 
clear water. Fill all cracks and broken places with new 
plaster. Do not apply whitewash until the surface is quite 
dry. Give two or more coats as needed. 

The following mixtures are recommended : 

Slake a sufficient amount of lime in water to make a pail- 
ful of whitewash, and while still hot stir in a pint of flour 
boiled with water to form a thin cooked starch. Stir well 
and dilute with hot water to the right consistency. 

Or slake 8 quarts of lime and add 1 pound of sulphate of 
zinc and Yi pound of common salt dissolved in water. This 
is a hard, firm wash that will not crack.

CHAP-^ER XL 

LAUNDERING AND REMOVAL OF STAINS FROM CLOTHING 

It is the privilege of rich and poor aHke to possess clean 
clothing. Water and soap are inexpensive and sunshine 
and fresh air are everywhere, which are indispensible in de- 
stroying harmful bacteria. 

Water is nature's best cleanser. When in motion water 
holds in suspension particles of dirt. Much of the soil of 
clothes may be dissolved in water, or, by the aid of soap, an 
emulsion is formed and the dirt is carried off. 

Soft Water is best for laundry work. The most common 
mineral found in water is lime, which makes water hard. 
Temporary hardness of water is most common. It is due 
to a soluble lime compound which will combine with soap 
to form a greasy scum. To overcome this difficulty water 
should be boiled. In case the hardness is not removable by 
boiling, it is called permanently hard water. To overcome 
this, add lime water or weak carbonated alkali before boil- 
ing. In softening water with an alkali, only as much as is 
necessary to do the work is desirable. More acts upon 
clothing and hands, weakening fabric and skin. The larger 
the amount and the greater the strength of the alkali, the 
worse the effect. 

The alkalies commonly known and used in the household 
are: 

Aininonia, a gas dissolved in water, and mild in its action 
if diluted; it readily evaporates if heated. It is compara- 
tively expensive. 

596 



THE HOUSEKEEPER

597 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Borax, a powder, mild and expensive. 

Sal Soda, or Carbonated Alkali, a crystal or powder, 
stronger and cheaper than borax. 

Potash, or Lye, a liquid or solid, strong but little used in 
modern times. It is derived from wood ashes by a process 
of leeching; is used in making "soft soap." 

SOIL IN GARMENTS 

Garments of linen and other fabrics become soiled prin- 
cipally by the oily excretions from the body, as in perspira- 
tion and the natural oil of the hair, and in the case of table 
linen, by animal fats, etc. These greasy substances by 
their adhesive quality attract and hold particles of dirt. 

SOAP 

When soap is dissolved in water, the neutral alkali salts 
become in part separated into alkali, which dissolves, and 
free fatty acid, which precipitates. This explains why the 
transparency of clear water is disturbed by the use of soap 
even of the purest kind. 

The detergent or cleaning properties of soap are due to 
the presence of free alkali, either caustic potash or soda lib- 
erated in the soapsuds. This attacks and decomposes the 
grease contained in soiled linen, unites with fatty acids, and 
in turn saponifies them. The process is precisely similar 
to that of soap-making. The union of the alkali set free 
in soapsuds with the grease of garments or dishwater pro- 
duces a soapy substance which is readily soluble, and hence 
is easily removed by rinsing. 

Free Alkali. — Since the cleansing properties of soap are 
due to the presence of free alkali, it may be asked why the 
alkalies themselves — as potash, lye or sal soda cannot be 
used without the trouble of uniting them with animal fats 
by soap-making. It is true that lye and other strong alkalies 
have strong detergent properties. They attack, however, not 
only the grease, but also the fabrics themselves, and rot

or weaken them, and also irritate the skin. Hence the 
object of soap-making- is to form a comi)oun(l which wih 
release a small, definite quantity of alkali at the moment 
that it is required. 

In choosing soap, the use to which it is put must be con- 
sidered. A white, neutral, floating soap, like Ivory, can be 
used for all toilet purposes, and is also the best soap for 
silks, woolens, laces and fine muslin. It will affect the 
fabric less than any other kind, and, being white, leaves no 
color to be rinsed out or removed later. The light brown 
soap, like Lenox, is the universal laundry soap. The small 
amount of resin in it gives it its color. The resin helps to 
form the suds which acts as a dirt carrier. 

A good naptha soap lessens the work of rubbing and for 
that reason is popular with housewives who do their own 
washing. It also does awav with boiling if plenty of 
water, sunshine and fresh air are used, but an occasional 
boiling is even then necessary to make clothes ]n\Ye and 
sweet smelling. 

The petroleum oil is a valuable solvent and adds to the 
effectiveness of soap. P. and G. is the White Naptha soap ; 
shave it into warm ( not hot ) water and soak the clothes in 
it for an hour, or, better still, over night. Verv dirty 
clothes should have soap rubbed into them before soaking. 
Rinse clothes out of water in which the\- have been soaked, 
look them over for soiled spots which may need rubbing. 

Soap Solution. — For laundry purposes one bar of ordi- 
nary laundry soap may be cut up and dissolved in three or 
four quarts of hot water; this can be used at once while 
hot. or kept in a glass or china jar until needed. 

EQUIPMENT FOR HOME LAUNDRY. 

The room, used for laundr}- work, should be light and 
airy. 

The stove, if for laundry work exclusively, should be 
one made for the purpose. It need never be blacked.

Tubs, if stationary, should be porcelain lined. Slate is 
next best, but has seams, which are undesirable. Tubs are 
also made of cement. Wood is too absorptive to be clean. 
The height of stationary tubs from the floor is rarely right 
for the average woman. This should be considered when 
they are set. Portable tubs are made of fibre, galvanized 
iron, enamel or wood. The wooden ones are best if made 
of cedar and brass-bound, but all wooden tubs are heavy, 
and will warp and leak if not kept in a damp place or with 
water in them. Tubs of all kinds must be kept clean. 

Other utensils necessary for the home laundry are a rub- 
bing board, a wringer, a wash boiler, which should be of 
copper, because of its duraljility and its power to conduct 
heat. A clothes stick, two pails, a teakettle and dishpan 
will prove useful, and measuring cup and spoons and a 
wooden spoon are needed for the starch. For ironing there 
should be a table which may also be used for sprinkling, a 
skirt board, iron stand, and electric iron if possible; a sleeve 
board is convenient to have. 

There must also be a clothes rack, clothes basket, line and 
clothes pins and a whisk broom to use for sprinkling clothes. 

A cupboard in the laundry supplied with articles needed 
for washing will prove con\'enient. The following list of 
materials for the laundry is cjuoted from Proctor & Gamble 
Company's "Approved Methods for Home Laundering": 

Bccszva.v or Paraffinc, used to fill up and make smooth 
sad irons. It should be tied in a cloth for easier handling. 

Common Salt, neutral compound, used as a scourer for 
soiled irons, or to set colors. 

JVhitc Sand, used as a scourer for soiled irons. 

Aniinonia, in liquid form (household ammonia), and 

Borax, a white pow^der. Both being mild alkalies, they 
are used where soaking rather than rubbing is desirable to 
loosen the dirt, and the color is not to be considered. 

^(7/ Soda, or washing soda, is used for testing, and to 
"break" hard water.

J at file IV (Iter is used lo take out stains, and to Dleacfi. 

Muriatic Acid, dilute, a liquid, and 

Oxalic Acid, in crystal form are used to take out stains. 
A medicine dropper is desirable to use with these, as the 
skin is easily roughened by them. 

Jlncgar, used to set colors. It should be colorless. 

Grain Alcohol, used to dissohe sugar, some medicine, and 
grass stains. 

Ether will dissolve fat or oil from the more delicate 
fabrics. 

Kerosene is a solvent, used in washing and cleaning 
rubber. 

Gasoline is used to take out stains and clean gloves and 
ribbons. Being very inflammable, it must be used with 
great care and where there is no flame. 

Sulphur is used as a bleacher. When burned, the fumes 
must be brought in contact with a moist stain. 

Powdered Clwlk or Fuller's Earth is used to absorb stains. 

Soafy should be bought in quantity and kept in a clean, dry 
place. If allowed to harden, there is less waste in using. 

FABRICS. 

Fabrics are of both animal and vegetable origin. The 
vegetable fibres are cotton and linen. These are composed 
of cellulose, a woody substance, and are tough, strong, and 
not so easily dyed as animal fibres. 

Animal fibres are wool and silk and are nitrogenous in 
character. They are more easily injured than the vegetable 
fibres, silk being more delicate than wool. 

LAUNDERING PROCESSES 

Sorting the laundry. — Sort the small and delicate pieces 
of fine linen, as laces, fine waists, aprons, and petticoats, in 
one pile. 

604 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



Put the table linen, linen towels, and doilies in another 
pile ; the bed and body linen, kitchen towels, and bath tow- 
els, in a third ; the colored clothes, hoisery, and coarser ar- 
ticles in a fourth and the flannels and woolens by them- 
selves. These lots should be kept separate throughout the 
washing, the fine linen and table linen going into the first 
tub and the first boiler ; bed and body linen into the second 
tub and second boiler ; colored clothes being washed sep- 
arately, but not boiled ; and flannels being reserved for sep- 
arate treatment. 

Look over clothes for any stains ; these should be removed 
according to directions for each specific stain given at the 
end of this chapter. 

Rubbing. — Rubbing is, of course, merely a mechanical 
process, but it assists the action of soap and washing com- 
pounds by removing the greasy substances that have been 
decomposed by the alkali and by bringing what remains 
into contact with alkaline suds. 

Boiling. — Boiling is also a mechanical process, as the 
steam passing through the garments loosens the particles 
of dirt contained in their texture. Boiling water and steam 
also increase the activity of the alkali in attacking and 
decomposing the grease. 

To stop a leak in the boiler temporarily, press a piece of 
soap over the hole. 

Rinsing. — Rinsing is a mechanical operation for remov- 
ing the excess of soap, wnth the dirt, glycerin, and other 
impurities that have been released by the action of the wash- 
ing compounds. 

The means employed to remove dirt on fabrics are soak- 
ing, boiling, rubbing, and rinsing, with the use of an alkali 
either in soaps or in the various preparations known as 
washing powders and washing fluids. 

The principal object of rinsing clothes is to remove the 
excess of soap. Hence they must be thoroughly rinsed until 
all the suds disappear from the water. If plenty of hot 

605 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



water can be had it should be used for the first rinsing, as 
the soap contained in the garment will dissolve in hot water 
much more readily than in cold. It is customary, however, 
to lift the clothes from the boiler directly into a tub of cold 
rinsing water, rinse thoroughly, wring out into a second 
rinsing water, and continue rinsing until all trace of soap 
disappears. If any soap is left in the garments, it will unite 
with the bluing and makes the clothes yellow. After the 
final rinsing and bluing, the articles must be ^^•rung out, 
rolled in bundles, and sorted, starched pieces being placed 
in one basket, and unstarched ones in another, and hung up 
to dry at once. It is a good idea to first spread a large, clean 
cloth in the bottom of the basket. 

Clean the clothes line by winding it on a board and scrub- 
bing it with soap, using a stiff Inrush. 

We quote the following from Proctor & Gamble Com- 
pany's "Approved Methods of Home Laundering" : The 
more sunshine and fresh air available the less blue is 
needed. Xo rule or proportion can be given for bluing. 
The quantity to be used must be regulated by the color and 
the amount of clothes to be 1)lued, Often more blue must 
be added, or a fresh water made. Tie the solid blue in a 
thick cloth, flannel preferred, wet it, and squeeze out. Make 
a strong solution of bluing in hot water, using a dipper or 
small pan to hold it in, and from this add what is needed 
to the tub of water. Take a little of the solution in the 
palm of the hand to test it. It should be of a pale blue 
color. When bluing water is right in color, stir it up and 
use at once. If it stands the solid blue will settle, and 
clothes that touch the bottom or sides of the tub will become 
streaked with blue. Shake out each article and drop it into 
the bluing water; then very soon wring it out and drop it 
into a clean basket. Unstarched clothes are now ready 
for the line. Clothes requiring" thick or raw starch should 
also go onto the line to get the sun and air.

Starching comes next for those clothes requiring thin 
starch : aprons, shirt-waists, the trimming of underwear, 
etc. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING STARCH 

Mix starch with a small cjuantity of cold water to a creamy 
consistency, add a little more cold water, and then the de- 
sired amount of absolutely boiling water, stirring constantly. 
Put the starch over the fire and boil it for several minutes, 
to insure complete cooking, and stir it all the time it is 
cooking. Cool or dilute for use. If oil, borax, or wax are 
used, they should be cooked with the starch, but bluing is 
added later. 

The proportions for cooked starch are one measurement 
of starch to sixteen of boiling water, for thin starch, and 
one measure of starch to eight of boiling water for thick 
starch. 

Uncooked or partly cooked starch will stick and make 
trouble for the ironer. ( Irons must always be hot for 
starched clothes.) Starch can be made thinner by adding 
water, and it always grows thinner with use. Starched 
clothes must never be stitT enough to rattle. 

Thin starch. — 

Mix 1 cup starch and 

^ cup cold water, add 

y2 level teaspoonful shaved white wax or lard, and 

3 Cjuarts boiling water. 

The amount of starch needed depends upon the number 
of rarments to be starched. Those that should be stiffest 
must be starched first. Dry or thick materials take up more 
starch than w^et or thin ones, and the starch may need to 
be thinned with water for some garments. When only 
part of a garment is to be starched, gather that part into 
the hand and dip it into the starch, rub it well, then squeeze 
out the extra starch. This must be done by hand, the rest 
of the garment being held out of the w^ay. The starched 
pieces are hung out with the rest.

Drying. — Sunshine and fresh air are so valuable in 
bleaching and purifying clothes that we cannot afford to 
dry clothes indoors if we can control a bit of outdoors 
To aid in the bleaching, put clothes out without wringing, 
or let them lie on the grass and moisten them frequently. 

The line must be wiped with a damp cloth, and the 
clothes-pin bag, which is also an apron, must be tied on. 
Hang each piece so that the threads of the material are 
straight and the garment is as nearly as possible in the 
shape desired when ready to use again. This helps greatly 
to simplify the rest of the work, and, if ironing for every 
piece is impossible, you will have straight, sweet, sun- 
dried clothes to wear or use, without any further work 
except folding. Alany people prefer the odor 
of sun-dried clothes, and if the wind whips out the 
wrinkles, they are very acceptable. Ribbed underwear, 
stockings, towels, and often sheets and pillowcases, can be 
finished in this way when economy in laundry work must 
be practiced — but always the ribbed underwear. Hang 
pieces of a kind together and place hems well over the line 
l)efore pinning. Hems rather than selvages should go 
over the line. Consider how things will dry quickly, and 
never let water run into gathers or have corners to stretch 
out and straighten later. To prevent clothes from freez- 
ing in zero weather, put a handful of salt in the rinsing 
water. When clothes are dry, take them down carefully, 
shake them free from dust and possible insects, and fold 
them lightly (never crush them) into the basket. 

Dampening or sprinkling is usually done several hours 
before ironing. Cover the table with a clean cloth, fill a 
basin with warm water, and use a clean whisk broom for 
sprinkling. The whisk should be kept for this purpose 
only. A patent sprinkler may be used, or the hand, but 
the drops should always be small. Sprinkle each large 
piece, fold pieces together before rolling. Linen should 
be very damp. Pack all the rolls into the basket and cover 
tightly. Sprinkle only what can be ironed the next day.

If kept damp too long, in hot weather especially, the clothes 
may mildew. 

Ironing is the finish of good laundry work and the test 
of the laundress. It is done to make clothes smooth, to 
make them feel better and stay clean longer. Have ready 
an ironing table or board, tightly covered with a blanket 
and a clean ironing sheet, an iron stand, and clean irons — 
and to keep the irons clean and the sheet unsoiled, 
have at hand beeswax in a cloth, a piece of old cloth, 
and a piece of clean paper, folded three or four 
times, to try the irons on. To moisten the clothes if 
they become dry, there should be a bowl of clean water and 
a clean, soft cloth. A large piece of paper may be spread 
on the floor to protect any pieces that may hang to the floor. 
If the irons are heated by gas, they must be wiped off sev- 
eral times while heating, or else the moisture that collects 
on the cold iron will rust and soil the clothes. Try the iron 
on a piece of old cloth. Another test is to touch the bot- 
tom of the iron with a wet finger; if it hisses, it is hot — 
the shorter the hiss, the hotter the iron. 

Shake or stretch the article to be ironed into shape and 
place on the board, having the threads of the cloth straight. 
Iron with the right hand from right to left, using the left 
hand to arrange the material, but occasionally iron with the 
left hand. As the material is ironed, bring it over the table 
or board toward you. First iron the part that will wrinkle 
least, leaving the plain, straight parts until the last. Rufifles 
and trimming should be ironed first. Lace must be 
stretched into shape before ironing and again afterward, to 
soften it. Best results are attained when the iron follows 
the long warp thread of the material. The cloth should be 
left dry, especially bands, hems and seams, or they will 
wrinkle. Linen must be very wet, and must be ironed with 
a heavy iron until perfectly dry. This gives a smooth glossy 
surface and firmness to the material. For heavy materials 
use heavy irons; for thin materials, lighter irons, and for 

609

gathers, a narrow, pointed iron. Iron quickly with an iron 
hot, yet not hot enough to scorch. If the material becomes 
dry or soiled, dampen or rub it with a soft cloth. 

Folding does not improve the appearance of articles, but 
it is necessary in order to store things and keep them from 
mussing. In general, all pieces should be folded several 
times lengthwise, then softly crossw'ise, until of conven- 
ient shape for handling. The trimming, if any, should show, 
and usually it governs the shape of the folded garment. 

Airing is necessary to perfectly dry the clothes; the 
clothes should hang over night on the bars, and be sorted, 
mended, and put away the next day. Damp clothes are a 
menace to health. Clothes should l)e aired in clean, pure 
air, that they may smell sweet and be free from dust." 

COLORED CLOTHES 

The present condition of the dyes used for colored cot- 
ton fabrics makes it necessary always to wash a sample 
of material before laundering the whole garment so that 
if the dye does not prove to be a fast color it may be set. 
"The dyes are of two kinds: substantive, those that com- 
bine with the material to be d}-ed, and adjective, those that 
attach themselves to, rather than coml)ine with, the matt- 
rial. To the former class belong the wools and silks; to 
the latter, the linens and cottons. From the tough, resistant 
character of the linen and cotton fibres, we can understand 
.that they will not readily take up color and that, if they do, 
they will part w^ith it easily. Strong soaps, hot water, and 
even sunshine tend to weaken their color, so that the great- 
est care must be used in washing colored clothes, especially 
if the color is delicate. AVe know that most reds, pinks, 
and blacks are fast, but we are never sure of anything until 
we have washed a sample and dried it. If the color suf- 
fers, try to set it with a solution of salt, white vinegar, 
borax, alum, or sugar of lead (a strong poison). These 
may be used in the proportion of one level tablespoonful of 

610

THE HOUSEKEEPER 



any one of them to a gallon of water. None but a "neut- 
ral" soap must be used, and sometimes starch water rather 
than soap. The starch is very, very, thin, and is used as 
you would use suds. Ordinarily, good results are obtained 
by following the directions given below : 

Make a warm suds of Ivory Soap Flakes and water, and 
quickly wash, rinse and hang out to dry one garment at a 
time. Should the water be colored by the goods, take fresh 
water for the next garment. X^ever rub soap on the goods, 
nor the goods on the board — except the edges of the hem if 
very much soiled. Scjueeze or rub it gently by hand. When 
clean, rinse it several times, until the last water is clear, and 
use acidified water if necessary. The use of alum water will 
make garments less inflammable. If you want to strengthen 
a blue garment, use bluing. Starch the garment at once in 
thin starch, after turning it wrong side out; shake it into 
shape, and hang it to dry in the shade. When dry, dampen 
and roll up the garment, but only a short time before iron- 
ing. Muslins, prints, and ginghams should be ironed on the 
wrong side whenever possible, as it makes the material look 
like new. 

To dry colored clothes, if there is no shady place, pin 
them on the shady side of a sheet hung double and they will 
not fade. 

To whiten a faded dress, boil it in 2 gallons of water in 
which 1 cupful of cream of tartar is dissolved. 

WOOLENS 

Woolen material will easily shrink if carelessly handled. 
A "neutral" soap must be used, and if a soap claims to wash 
without shrinking, it does so only becaugje you follow 
carefully the directions that come with the soap. Strong 
soaps or alkalies, except the milder ones — borax and am- 
monia — weaken the fibre and make it more liable to shrink. 
The rubbing on of soap of any kind is not desirable, be- 
cause you must get it out, and it may recjuire the rubbing 

612 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



of the material, which tends more than anything else to 
mat the wool and shrink the garment. Hot water and 
then cold must not be used, because heating expands the 
fibres, and as they lie so close together, they may interlock ; 
then, when the cold contracts the fibres, they cannot unlock. 
As a consequence, the material shrinks. Extremes of tem- 
perature, then, are to be avoided. 

Shake the dust out of the flannel. Make warm suds with 
Ivory Soap solution. Have it so the hands can very com- 
fortably be held in the water. H the garment is quite 
soiled, add half a tablespoonful of household ammonia for 
each gallon of water, and let the garment soak for ten min- 
utes. Draw the garment through the hands, work it up and 
down, and squeeze it, but do not rub soap on it or rub it on 
the board. Put through the wringer, turn the garment 
wrong side out and put it through a second suds the same 
temperature as the first. If any soiled spot does not yield 
to this treatment, lay it upon the table or other smooth sur- 
face, hold it straight, and rub it briskly with a small brush. 
If necessary, use a little soap solution on the brush. Rinse 
the garment quickly through several waters of the same 
temperature as the first water. Rinse flannel until the 
water is clear. Put it through the wringer or squeeze the 
water out ; do not twist it. Shake it or hang it out to dry 
where it is warm — not where it is so hot that the garment 
will steam, or where it is cold. Guard against extremes of 
temperature. Stretch the garment into shape as it dries. 
This is especially true of ribbed underwear, which also does 
not need to be ironed. Press flannel when nearly dry, on 
the wrong side, until perfectly dry, using a moderately warm 
iron. Never have the iron so hot that the flannel will steam, 
and press, rather than rub it. Closely twisted and woven 
wool will shrink less than looselv woven materials. 



613 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



SILKS 

Silk fibre is smooth and shiny, and for best results re- 
(juires the same treatment in the laundry as wool, li rubbed 
hard, the fibre is broken and the shiny effect lost. It should 
never be boiled. 

Wash silk carefully in warm water, with Ivory Soap solu- 
tion in it. Soak twenty minutes if necessary, and take fresh 
suds for the washing. Do not rub silk except with a soft nail 
brush over a smooth surface. Rinse in several warm waters 
until the last water is clear. Place between dry towels and 
l)ut through wringer loosely adjusted, or scjueeze water 
from it and hang to dry where you can watch it. When 
nearly dry, iron with a moderately hot iron, until perfectly 
dry. If the iron is hot the silk will be stiff. A thin muslin 
spread over the silk before ironing may give better results 
when material is thin. If silk is colored, it will be better 
to try a sample, and to set it as you would colored cottons, 
with salt or vinegar." 

For white silk use one teaspoonful methylated spirits to 
one pint of water for rinsing. 

For yclloivcd handcrkcrchicfs or other fine linen, soak in 
cold water to which a little ammonia has been added. Then 
cut a large lemon into slices, including the rind, and boil it 
in a pan. When at the boiling point put in the handkerchiefs 
and boil them 20 minutes. 

•GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF STAIN REMOVAL 

"The removal of stains is a necessary feature of the laun- 
dering and general care of clothing and other household tex- 
tiles. Most stains may be removed easily at home, provided 
reliable methods are known and a few simple precautions 
are taken. 

Too much emphasis can not be laid on the importance 

of applying the stain removers while the stain is still fresh, 

for usually it is much more difficult to remove an old stain 

(^Farmers' Bulletin 861, "Removal of Stains from Clothing and 
Other Textiles.") 

614 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



than a fresh one. Changes in the character of the stain, 
brought about by drying, exposure to air, washing, ironing, 
or in other ways, often make it necessary to use chemicals 
in removing old stains, whereas in many cases much simpler 
methods are successful if the stains are treated when fresh. 

The nature of a stain should be known, if possible, be- 
fore its removal is attempted, since this determines the treat- 
ment to be adopted. Moreover, if an unsuitable stain re- 
mover is used, the stain may be "set" so that its removal 
becomes difficult or even impossible. 

The kind of fabric upon which the stain occurs also 
should be known. The method of treatment adopted de- 
pends as much upon the nature, color, weave, finish and 
weight of the fabric as upon the kind of stain. Cotton and 
linen are destroyed by strong acids and attacked to some 
extent even by weaker ones. Concentrated acids, there- 
fore, should never be used in removing stains from these 
fabrics, and when dilute acids are used they should be 
neutralized afterwards with a suitable alkali or removed 
by thorough rinsing; otherwise the acid mav become con- 
centrated on dr}'ing and destroy the fibers. Generally 
speaking, alkalis do not attack cotton or linen fabrics to the 
extent that acids do. However, long-continued or repeated 
exposure to alkalis, especially in hot solution, weakens the 
fibers. 

Wool and silk, being more delicate than cotton and linen, 
require more careful treatment. The use of very hot water 
must be avoided, since it turns both w^ool and silk yellow, 
shrinks wool, and weakens silk and injures its finish. These 
materials also will not stand much rubbing, as this felts 
together the wool fibers and results in a shrinkage or thick- 
ening of the material, while the silk fabrics, as a rule, are 
too delicate to stand much rubbing without breaking or 
separating the fibers. Both wool and silk are dissolved by 
strong alkalis and are injured even by washing soda or 
strongly alkaline soap. The only alkalis which should be 
used in laundering or removing stains from wool and silk 



615 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



are the milder ones like borax or dilute solutions of am- 
monia. Acids, with the excepton of nitric which weakens 
and turns the fibers yellow, do not attack wool and silk 
readily. 

In general it is more difficult to remove stains from wool 
and silk than from cotton or linen. In removing stains 
from materials made from two or more kinds of fibers, such 
as silk and cotton mixtures, the effects of the stain re- 
movers upon all of the fibers should be considered. No 
chemical should be used which would injure the most deli- 
cate fibers present. 

It is also much more difficult to remove stains from col- 
ored than from white materials, for the reason that most 
of the bleaching agents which must be used to remove per- 
sistent stains are likely to destroy the color of the material 
as well. 

METHODS FOR TREATMENT OF STAINS IN GENERAL 
LAUNDERING 

Ordinary laundering for removing stains, should be done 
as follows : First, soak the stained portion in cold or luke- 
warm water, rubbing the stain with a neutral soap if neces- 
sary. Follow this by thorough rinsing in clean water, after 
which the article may be laundered as usual. Use this 
method only for cotton and linen (white or fast colors) and 
the so-called wash e ilks and washable woolens, i f the mate- 
rials are delicate, sponge them. 

SPONGING 

Sponging is applicable to all fabrics, but especially to del- 
icate materials or colors which ordinary laundering might 
injure. Spread the stained article on a flat surface in a good 
light, and beneath the stain put a cloth folded into several 
thicknesses, or clean, white blotting paper, to absorb the 
superfluous liquid. Change the pad for a fresh one as soon 
as it becomes soiled. Sponge with a clean, soft lintless 

616 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



cloth (preferably of the same material as that stained) and 
renew it as frequently as may be necessary. Lay the stained 
material with the wrong side up and apply the water to 
the back, so that the foreign substances can be washed from 
the fibers onto the pad without having to pass through the 
material. 

APPLICATION OF CHEMICALS 

Chemicals should not be used until water or laundering 
has been tried for they attack the fibers of the cloth as well 
as the stain. 

There are a few common chemicals which are necessary 
in removing some stains, and these should be kept in every 
household. A good plan is to have a small cupboard in the 
laundry where these chemicals may be kept together with 
the utensils used in applying them. As some of these chemi- 
cals are poisonous they should all be labeled and kept out 
of the reach of children. Chemicals most commonly used 
in removing stains are Javelle water, potassium perman- 
ganate (solution), oxalic acid, ammonia water, French 
chalk, and cream of tartar. 

With these chemicals should be kept some of the utensils 
used in applying them ; such as a medium-sized bowl, a medi- 
cine dropper, a glass rod with rounded ends, several pads 
of cheese cloth or old muslin, and a small sponge. 

Other chemicals can be bought as needed at any of the 
larger drug stores. 

If the efl:'ect of the stain remover upon the fiber or color 
is not known, try it by applying a little to a sample or to an 
unexposed portion of the goods. Sometimes it is best to 
remove the stain even if some of the color is removed also, 
for the color often may be restored by careful tinting. 

Stretch the stained portion of the garment over a bowl 
of clean water and apply the chemical with a medicine drop- 
per. The chemicals may be rinsed out quickly by dipping 
in the clean water. Another method is to place the stained 

617 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



portion over a pad of folded cloth and apply the chemical 
with a glass rod. The rinsing or neutralizing always must 
be thorough. 



JAVELLE WATER 

1 lb. sal soda, or preferably pearl ash 
34 lb. chloride of lime 

2 quarts cold water. 

"Mix thoroughly, let it stand several hours. Pour ofi 
clear licjuid and bottle for use. Keep in a dark, cool place." 

To use Javelle water, stretch the stained article and rub 
the liquid into it, rinse quickly in clear water, and brush 
again if necessary. 

If allowed to remain too long in contact with the fibers 
Javelle water rots even linen and cotton materials and it 
should, therefore, always be neutralized with oxalic acid 
and the fabric rinsed thoroughly to remove all traces of the 
chemical. Several applications of the Javelle water with 
intermediate neutralizations are necessary with persistent 
stains. 

POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE 

Potassium permanganate can be used in removing stains 
from all white fabrics. It also may be used successfully 
ui)on many colored materials, but should always be tried first 
on an unexposed portion of the goods, to determine its ef- 
fect on the dye. It does not harm delicate fibers, provided 
it is used with reasonable care. First, remove as much of 
the stain as possible by sponging or washing with cold water. 
Prepare and use the permanganate as follows : Dissolve 
1 teaspoonful of the crystals in a pint of water and apply a 
little of this to the stain with a medicine dropper, a glass rod, 
or a clean cork, and allow it to remain for about five min- 
utes. Remove any pink or brown stain left by the perman- 
ganate, by applying one of the following" chemicals : 

618 



THE tl O U S E K E E P E R 



Oxalic acid in saturated solution or lemon juice for cot- 
ton, linen, or silk. Hydrogen peroxide is more satisfactory 
for wool. 

Eollow the treatment by thorough rinsing. 

One or more repetitions of this treatment may be neces- 
sary in the case of persistent stains. 

OXALIC ACID 

This is poisonous and should be used carefully; the bottle 
in which it is kept must be marked "Poison." 

To prepare a solution of oxalic acid for use, use as many 
of the crystals of the acid as will dissolve in a pint of luke- 
warm water. Put into a bottle, stopper tightly, and use 
as needed. Apply this solution to the stain with a medicine 
dropper or glass rod and after allowing it to remain for a 
few minutes rinse thoroughly in clean water. 

HYDROGEN PEROXID 

Hydrogen Peroxid, as obtained for medical purposes, 
usually is made slightly acid, to give it better keeping 
equality. Eor use in removing stains make a small amount 
of the peroxid slightly alkaline with ammonia. It then 
decomposes easily and its oxygen is free to attack the stain. 
Since hydrogen peroxid affects the fiber also, in the case of 
cotton and linen materials, follow it by very careful rin- 
sing. Apply it to the stain with a medicine dropper, a glass 
rod, or a clean cork, or sponge the stain with it. The 
method of using it in neutralizing potassium permanganate 
is described above." 

SPECIFIC METHODS FOR INDIVIDUAL STAINS 

In cases where the nature of the stain is not known it 
should be attacked first by sponging with cold water, pro- 
vided, however, that the fabric would not be injured by 
water. If the stain is not removed by cold or warm water, 

619 



THE HOUSEKEEPER 



chemicals should then be applied. Often the behavior of a 
stain, when treated with cold water, will give some indica- 
tion of its nature ; for instance a grease spot will not absorb 
water. Hot water should be avoided in treating unknown 
stains until after other substances have been tried, since hot 
water will set many stains and make their removal more 
difficult. 

Treatment for stains in general should be progressive, 
beginning with the milder remedies and reserving the more 
powerful ones to the last.

DRY CLEANSING 

Gasoline is often used for cleansing" wool or silk gar- 
ments and for cleansing kid gloves. 

To Use Gasoline. — Employed by the following methods 
gasoline \\ill thoroughly cleanse wool, silk, velvet, and 
other fabrics of animal fibers, l)ut not cotton, and will re- 
move grease, paint, wax, and mud stains except acid ones, 
without injury to the texture or colors of the fabric. The 
results are obtained by using a fairly large quantity of gas- 
oline and soaking" and washing the articles in.it the same as 
in water. The cost of cleaning" with gasoline is much less 
than is charged by a professional cleanser, and a great deal 
less than that of replacing the articles. 

Cleansing" with gasoline, should be done preferably out 
of doors, or if indoors, by daylight, and never in the 
vicinit^■ of a hot stove, lamp, or other flame. Care must be 
taken that matches are not accidently lighted in its 
vicinity. 

First, shake and brush the articles to remove dust and 
dirt. Tack small articles together and wash larger ones 
singly in an earthenware jar filled with gasoline and allow, 
them to soak for an hour or more. If the jar can be put 
in a pan which is surrounded with hot water (but not a 
hot stove or near any open flame ) , the gasoline will do its 
work Cjuicker and better and will be less disagreeable for 
the hands. The addition of common salt at the rate of one 
teaspoonful to each quart, will prevent leaving a ring. 
After soaking, work the articles about, rul)bing carefully 
between the fingers, or rub the spots with a toothbrush or 
nailbrush having fairly soft bristles, or dip the brush into 
a small can of gasoline set into a pan of hot water. Squeeze 
the gasoline out of the garments and put them into a second 
jar, into which pour fresh gasoline, meantime putting" other 
articles to soak in the first jar. After rinsing in the second 
jar squeeze the garments cjuite dry, stretch care full v to 
their proper shape, and thoroughly evaporate by airing

them on a line, and afterwards pressing them with a hot 
iron. 

To Clean Feathers. — Prepare suds by shaving and boil-

with 1 pint w'ater. Dilute with warm soft water. Immerse 
the plume in this and allow it to soak for ten or fifteen 
minutes, occasionally drawing it rather loosely through the

the same temperature. If not yet clean, lay the feather on 
a smooth surface and with a soft brush rub gently with 
soap and water, working outwardly from the stem. Rinse 
in clear warm water and afterwards, if a white feather, in 
bluing water. Draw through the palm of the hand to

To zvash zvhite silk gloves use suds; never rub soap on 
them or they will turn yellow. 

When zmshing chamois gloz'es leave soapsuds on them 
instead of rinsing in clear water and they will be as soft as 
new. 

To cleanse kid gloves milk and white soap is better than 
gasoline, as it wall make them cleaner, softer, and wear 
longer.

CHAPTER XLI 

HOUSEHOLD HINTS 

Have a spatula at hand read}^ for use. To lift dough 
shaped for cookies or doughnuts from the board, run the 
side rather than the end of the spatula beneath the dough. 
Either the end or the side may be used to remove cooked 
food from the pan. This is also convenient for scraping 
batter from a mixing bowl when baking. 

If the kitchen window is opened two inches at the top 
while frying foods, or boiling cabbage or onions, the un- 
pleasant odor will go out of the window instead of spreading 
through the house. 

To hasten the baking of piHatoes let them stand a few 
minutes in boiling water before putting them in the oven. 

Try mashing a large nitmlier of potatoes in a bread 
mixer. 

Dr\ celery leaves as you have them ; put them away in a 
fruit jar. When preparing soup, tie a few of the leaves in 
a cloth, and drop it into the kettle. You will find that the 
soup will have even more of the taste of celery than when 
using the stalk. 

The use of a double boiler in scalding milk, or in any 
cooking in which milk is the foundation, insures more per- 
fect cooking and a more easily cleaned dish. 

To deodorize cooking fat cut up a potato and fry in the 
fat. By so doing both fishballs and doughnuts may be 
fried in the same fat. 

For flavoring icings and cakes a medicine dropper is use- 
ful. 

To make pop corn big and flaky put it in a strainer and 
throw a little cold water on it before popping.

To serve -ccith meat if potatoes grow monotonous, try 
fried sliced bananas and boiled rice. 

To prcr'cHt the contents of a kettle from boiling over 
grease the inner rim. 

To keep ereani sweet scald it in the top of a double boiler, 
put it in a glass bottle, cover, and set aside to cool. Cream 
thus treated will keep sweet and fresh several days. 

When making ice cream a small (juantity of cream will 
go farther if whipped or scalded. 

In making mayonnaise use vinegar which has been poured 
over pickdes, beets or cucumbers, instead of fresh vinegar; 
this adds a pleasant flavor to salads. To thicken mayon- 
naise set the bowl into a dish of ice while beating. 

// you do not wish to serir pastry, bake the filling for 
pumpkin or scjuash pie in custard cups set in a pan of hot 
water. You mav add % more milk to the custard. The 
result is a delicious, creamy dessert. 

Uses for salt. — To beat eggs cjuickly add a pinch of salt. 
This also applies when whipping cream. Place a pan of 
salt in the oven under the baking tins in order to prevent 
the scorching of their contents. Put salt in the water when 
you wish to cool a dish quickly. Use salt to remove ink 
stains from carpet when the ink is fresh. 

JJ'hen broiling fish jjlace the fish on a wooden picnic 
plate, then on the broiler. This keeps the fish whole and 
does away with washing a greasy broiler. 

// potatoes are watery score the skins all the way around, 
boil them in salt water with the skins on, and they will be- 
come dry. 

Lima Beans may be soaked over night, put in a regular 
bean pot and baked for four or five hours with three or four 
slices of pork. These are excellent and provide a change 
from stewed lima beans. 

To preserve the rich red color of quinces steam them on 
the back of the stove with a cover that lets the steam out, 
until they are as red as you want them. 

For a toaster an asbestos mat can be used.

To make dry bread into delicious toast hold under run- 
ning cold water for a second and then toast in the usual 
way. 

To prevent bread from getting moldy be sure the cover 
of the bread jar is tipped a bit, so as to let the air ni. 

Breakfast Bacon can be fried deliciously by cutting off 
the rind and dipping each slice in flour and frying it very 
quickly. 

To prevent the under pie crust from becoming soggy rub 
over with the white of an egg before putting in the filling. 

// juice runs out of blueberry pies just add a pinch of 
soda before you put the top crust on and there will be no 
difficulty. 

Rhubarb pies will retain the juice if you sift a tablespoon- 
ful of flour in with the sugar. Try adding a little cinna- 
mon and nutmeg to improve the flavor. 

To prevent cake from drying place an apple or orange in 
the cake box. This improves the flavor also. 

// cake sticks to the pans, dust a little flour over the 
greased pans and it will prevent the cake from sticking. 
Paper will not be necessary. 

To beat cake, the work is easier if you use a wooden 
spoon and beat the mixture with the back of the spoon. 

To prezrnt cake from sticking, let the pan stand for a 
few minutes on a wet cloth after you take it from the oven. 
To umke French Salad Dressing put the oil, salt, and 
pepper in a bottle, add the vinegar a little at a time, and 
shake hard. This is both more rapid and more satisfactory 
than stirring. 

In a bo.v in a dra-.wr in the kitchen keep the following 
articles :— Long-blade shears, darning needle, twine, alumi- 
num thimble, spool of No. 30 thread. 

The shears may be used for shredding lettuce or cabbage. 
The needle, twine and thimble are ready for sewing a fowl 
or fish that has been stuffed ; and the thread is useful in cut- 
ting butter, cheese and brown bread.

To use baking soda. — Use j/i teaspoonful baking soda to 
each cupful of sour milk and add j/i teaspoonful of bak- 
ing powder. Sift the soda and baking powder with the 
flour instead of adding the soda to the sour milk. This in- 
sures better mixing of the ingredients and prevents the for- 
mation of the carbon dioxide gas from the union of the 
soda and sour milk before it is added to the cake. 

To prci'cnf citron, raisins, or currants from sinking to 
the bottom of cake, heat in the oven before adding them to 
the batter. 

Hot baked puddings and custards will not stick to the 
baking dish if the dish is first rubbed over with fat and 
dredged with sugar. 

Cakes, loaf or layer, are c|uickly removed from loose- 
bottom aluminum cake-pans and the washing of the pans is 
easy. 

Use a magic cover when rolling out soft dough of any 
sort. When through work, scrape the cloth with a knife, 
if necessary, then shake out of doors. Wash the stockinet 
on the rolling pin often. 

To hasten the freezing of Ice Cream pour a dipper of 
water over the ice and salt just before you start turning the 
handle. 

// cream is hard to ivhip, add the white of an ^gg thor- 
oughly chilled. 

Chicken Soup may be given a dififerent and very delicious 
flavor by grating a bit of cheese into it. 

Before breaking a cocoanut put it in the oven. When 
heated a slight blow will crack it, and the shell will come 
cf¥ easily. 

To prevent the groivth of mold on the outside of a cured 
ham wrap it in a soft cloth wrung out in vinegar. 

Making Fat Compound at Home. — Cut or grind 1 pound 
of beef suet and try out the fat at a low temperature to 
prevent burning. A double boiler is good for this purpose. 
This should give 14 ounces of pure fat. To it add half as

much cottonseed oil. Stir occasionally while the mixture is 
hardening to make the fats blend well. 

To })icasnrc part of a cupful of fat. — For example : to 
measure % cupful of fat fill a measuring cup -yi full of cold 
water then drop in the fat until the water rises to the top of 
the cup. This prevents wasting the fat. which if meas- 
ured in the ordinary way by packing in the cup, wa:)uld 
cling to the sides and does away with the necessity for 
washing a greasy cup. 

Saz'c all paraffin paper from bread, cracker boxes, etc. 
Cut the paper to fit cake tins. After the pan is greased put 
a sheet of paper in the l)ottom, and this keeps the cake 
from sticking to the pan. It is better to let the paper stay 
on the cake after it is baked until it is cold, unless frost- 
ing is to be used. 

Sazr all the sinall bottles and jars in which bacon, malted 
milk, etc., are purchased. They may be used for left overs 
in canning and are useful for jellies, marmalades and 
pickles. 

To pre-z'ent the necessity of putting the hands into the hot 
icater to find the last piece of sikrr. — Soak the silver in 
warm water, place it in the perforated upper part of a 
steamer, plunge it up and down in hot, soapy water in the 
dish pan until clean. Let drain, pour scalding water over 
the silver and it is ready to wipe. 

Cleaning Lard Pails. — A\'hen the lard pail is empty lay it 
and the cover in a large pail, cover with cold water, add a 
tablespconful each of borax and soda, and slice in a little 
soap. Set on the stove and bring to a boil and let boil two 
hours or more. Take out and wash in hot, soapy water, 
rinse and dr\'. It will be very sweet and clean with no 
scrubbing.

refrigerator. This cooler should stand where there is free 
circulation of air either indoors (in a pan to catch the drip 
or in a constantly shaded, breezy place out of doors. 

Make a case about SjA ft. high x 12 inches x 15 inches 
with a solid top to hold a 12 or 15 inch dripping pan of 
water. In this frame place two moveable shelves 12" to 
15" apart. Fit the frame with a covering of white Canton 
flannel smooth side out — (Heavy duck or burlap may be 
used). Fasten this covering securely onto the frame with 
buggy or automobile curtain snaps so that the door may be 
opened without unfastening the cover. The hem on each 
side must extend far enough to cover the cracks of the door 
in order to keep out the warm outside air. The bottom of 
the covering must extend into the lower pan. Make six 
double strips (wicks) one-half the width of each side. Sew 
one side of each wick to the top of the sides and back of the 
cover. The other ends should lie 2" or 3" in the water in 
the pan. The fifth wick is the width of the door covering. 
These wicks conduct the water from the pan and moisten 
all the covering. Evaporation should be rapid. On dry, 
hot days a temperature of 50° has been known to be ob- 
tained in this simple cooler. It is worth trying, especially 
by mothers with bottle fed babies. 

For a sleci'c board cover, draw a discarded white stocking 
on the board over the padding ; it will fit snugly and will not 
loosen as it is used. 

// you zvill carefully zvasJi your summer clothes before 
putting them away they will be as good as new for next 
season. 

// cold starcli is made with weak soap suds it will not 
stick when the garment is ironed. 

To restore pearl buttons to their former luster after they

the floor against wall in slanting position and any uneven 
places in the skirt may be easily seen. 

To prevent summer lingerie from turning yellozu put it

dust out. 

7'o prevent pin holes in a panama hat have the shoe cob- 
bler put two white eyelets in the proper places. Use these 
when pinning on the hat. 

When sheets become zvorn in the middle tear in two 
lengthwise and sew the two selvages together. This will 
bring the wear on the part that was on the edge of the bed 
before and you will have a sheet as good as ever. 

IJlien basting long seams thread the needle to the bast- 
ing spool and do not cut thread. This method saves thread 
because it can be pulled in one long thread after stitching. 

An old raincoat may be utilized by making an apron for 
wash days, or a bathing cap, or a bag to carry your bathing 
suit in, or a bag for rubbers. 

Hem muslin curtains by hand and there will be less 
chance of their puckering. 

// fine laces are torn try puttmg a very thin piece of or- 
gandie or cotton mull under the worn places and darning 
down. 

When cutting cloth underneath a lace insertion slip a nar- 
row piece of cardboard with a pointed end between the in- 
sertion and the goods. The cardboard acts as a safeguard. 

To mend small holes in a silk umbrella stick a little piece 
of black court plaster on the inside of the hole. 

To prevent buttonholes in thin goods from ravelling 
mark the buttonholes with thread, then work completely 
before cutting. 

Piano keys may be kept white by rubbing them occa- 
sionally with a cloth dipped in alcohol. Care should be 
taken that the alcohol does not touch the wood, as it will 
take off the varnish.

and this remedy will not injure the drain pipes as caustic 
powders do. 

To pick up fragnients of broken glass pat with a woolen 
cloth until the smallest bit has adhered to the cloth. Then 
be sure to burn the cloth. 

A candle is convenient to have when traveling; it can be
