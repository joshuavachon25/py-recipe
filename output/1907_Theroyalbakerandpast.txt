DO NOT BUY BAKINQ POWDER LOOSE OR IN BULK.— (TThat is meant by loose is 
■weighed out in any quantity asked for. ) All examinations made by Boards of Health, Govern- 
ment Chemists, and others, prove loose powders are, almost -without exception, made from 
alum, and at a cost of about one tenth of what a pure Cream Tartar powder, like the " Royal" 
Baking Powder, can be made for. The argument that the consumer will save, in the purchase 
of such poisonous stuff, the cost of can, label, etc., is used simply to enable the seller to make 
a larger profit in selling an alum bulk, or loose, powder at the expense of the unsuspecting 
consumer, than can be made by selling the absolutely pure " Royal" brand. Remember this, 
and insist on getting the " Royal" in cans. 

Do not buy alum baking powders under any circumstances. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

MUST BE CAREFULLY READ BY EVERY ONE USING THIS BOOK 

HINTS ON BAKING. — To achieve perfecu success, the cook must use discrimination and 
care. Some flour requires more water, or milk, than others ; so that the quantity 
may have to be varied to make dough of a proper consistency. Different bakings will 
vary as to time and heat required, and should, therefore, be examined occasionally. To 
ascertain whether the bread is sufficiently done in the center of the loaf or cake, thrust a clean 
straw or long thin splinter into it. If done, there will be no dough on it when drawn out. 
Measure the fioui-, and be careful to mix with it the baking powder in a dry state, and before sift- 
ing. You can always substitute water for milk, or milk for water ; butter for lard, or lard for 
butter. The number of eggs may be increased or diminished, or, in plainer cake, etc., dispensed 
with entirely. Where fewer eggs are used than directed, always use a little more bakiag 
powder. JS'ever use sour milk. 

When about to cut new bread or cake, heat the knife very hot; this will prevent its 
crumbUng. 

CAKE BAKING. — For a plain cake made with one pound of flour. Royal Baking Powder, 
etc., the time to be allowed in baking would be from 40 to 50 minutes ; at the outside not more 
than 1 hour. Very rich cakes, in which butter and eggs predominate, take, of course, very 
much longer time to bake, a pound cake taking from l^ to 2 hours, and a bride's cake 3V^. 
On no account should an oven be too hot when the cake is put in — that is, hot enough to 
brown at once ; if so, in 5 minutes the whole outside will be burned and the interior will stand 
little chance of being baked. The old plan of feeling the handle of the oven door to test the 
heat is not always successful ; it is better to sprinkle a httle flour inside and shut the door for 
about 3 minutes ; if at the end of that time it is of a rich light brown, the cake may be put in, 
but if burned the heat must be lessened. 

In baking loaf cake, remember that unless you place a piece of paper over for protection at 
first, a top crust will be formed at once that prevents the radsing. When cake is well raised, 
remove the paper for browning on top. 

ADVICE TO THE COOK. — Great cleanliness, as well as care and attention, are required 
from a cook. Keep your hands very clean ; try to prevent your nails from getting black or 
discolored; don't "scatter "in your kitchen; clean up as you go; put cold water into each 
saucepan or stowpan as you finish using it. Dry your saucepans before you put them on the 
shelf. Scour tins with good mineral soap and rinse thoroughly in hot water. In cleaning a 
frying-pan, scour the outside as well as the inside. In cleaning greasy utensils, such as the 
soup-pot and frying-pan, wipe off the worst of the grease with soft paper (which can be 
burned), then soak in warm water to which soap-powder or a little ammonia has been added, 
finishing with mineral soap. Wash your pudding-cloths, scald, and hang them to dry directly 
after using them ; air them before you put them away, or they will be musty ; keep in dry 
place. Bo careful not to use a knife that has cut onions till it has been cleaned. Keep sink 
and sink-brush very clean ; be careful never to throw anything but water down sink. Do not 
throw cabbage water down it ; throw it away out of doors ; its smell is very bad. Never have 
sticky plates or dishes ; use very hot water for washing them ; when greasy, change it. Take 
care that you look at the meat the butcher brings, to see that it is good. Let there be no 
waste in the kitchen. 



Bread and Rolls 

BREAD was first made without leaven, 
heavy and solid. Then yeast was dis- 
covered, and yeast-risen bread came into 
use throughout the civUized world. Finally 
baking powder was devised, the most health- 
ful, economical, and convenient of all leavening 
or lightening agents. 

Yeast is a living plant. Mixed with the 
dough it causes fermentation and destruction 
of a part of the flour, and this produces car- 



bonic-acid gas. The hubbies of this gas become 
entangled in the dough, swelling it up and 
making it spongy. In this process, however, 
a part of the most nutritious elements of the 
flour (estimated at ten per cent.) is destroyed 
in producing the leavening gas ; there is al- 
ways danger of sour dough, and there is a 
delay of many hours for the sponge to rise. 

Perfect bread is that in which wheat is trans- 
posed into an available food without loss of 
any of its valuable properties. 

Royal Baking Powder is now largely used iu

place of yeast to leaven bread. It does pre- 
cisely the same work — that is, swells up the 
dough and makes it porous and spongy. But 
the process is not destructive: the baking 
powder by itself produces the leavening gas. 
No part of the flour is decomposed or de- 
stroyed. Moreover, there is no mixing or 
kneading with the hands, no setting of sponge 
overnight, as the loaf is mixed and ready for 
the oven at once. Bread thus made cannot 
sour, but will retain its moisture and freshness, 
and may be eaten while hot or fresh without 
distress even by persons of delicate digestion. 

The ease with which Royal Baking Powder 
bread is made, its cleanliness and healthful- 
ness, have caused it to supersede yeast bread 
with many of the best pastry cooks. 

In making this bread the materials and 
utensils should be brought together before the 
mixing of the dough is begun. The fire must 
be looked to so as to secure a steady, moderate 
heat. Remember to mix the flour and Royal 
Baking Powder together before sifting, and 
sift thoroughly before wetting. 

Royal Baking Powder Bread. — 1 quart flour, 
1 teaspoon salt, Mi teaspoon sugar, 2 heap- 
ing teaspoons Royal Baking Powder,* ^^ 
medium-sized cold boiled potato, and water. 
Sift together thoroughly flour, salt, sugar, and 
baking powder ; rub in the potato ; add sufii- 
cient water to mix smoothly and rapidly into a 
stiff dough, about the consistency of cake bat- 
ter : about a pint of water to a quart of flour 
will be required — more or less according to the 
brand and quality of the flour used. Do cot 
make a stiff dough as in yeast bread. Put the 
dough into a greased pan 4% by 8 inches, and 
4 inches deep, filling about half fuU. The loaf 
will rise to fill the pan when baked. Bake in 
very hot oven about 45 minutes, placing paper 
over first 15 minutes' baking, to prevent crust- 
ing too soon on top. Bake immediately after 
mixing. 

Household Bread.— Sift twice together 1

this will require about 1 pint of liquid. Turn 
at once into a greased loaf-pan (fig. XII), 
smooth the top with a knife dipped in melted 
butter, and bake immediately in a moderate 
oven about 1 hour. When done take from the 
pan, moisten with the hand dipped in cold 
water, wrap in bread-cloth till cold.

Hot Biscuits, Cakes, and 
Muffins 

EXPERIENCED housekeepers agree that 
breakfast is difficult to cater for. Even 
the appetite ordinarily easy to satisfy is 
likely to be captious when approaching the 
first meal of the day. Every article of food 
upon the breakfast-table, therefore, should be 
perfect — the coffee as clear as amber, the 
bacon white and crisp, the biscuits flaky, ten- 
der, delicious. 

As a nation we approve of hot-breads, and 
most of all at the breakfast-table. And while 
we eat and enjoy them, we have the satisfac- 
tion of knowing that American methods and 
American cookery have made them healthful 
as well as appetizing and nutritious. 

And of aU the breakfast foods, nothing is 
so appetizing, so appetite- whetting, so always 
dependable, so satisfying, as the light, flaky, 
hot biscuit, with a crisp, brown crust, just 
from the oven, broken apart without use of 
knife, and spread with butter; or, to top off 
the meal, with honey, jam, or marmalade. 

The very simplicity of the methods of mak- 
ing and the familiar, every-day use of this 
little hot bread-morsel have, however, some- 
times led to lack of care in its preparation, so 
that we too seldom find it in perfection upon 
our tables. 

It is the object of this chapter to stimulate 
an interest in and awaken a love for this most 
healthful and economical of our purely Ameri- 
can foods, so that it will be found, as it de- 
serves to be, a prominent part of every day's 
food in every household. 

With a basis of flour, salt, and Royal Baking 
Powder, we can add other ingredients to vary 
and enrich the cakes and biscuits generally 
known to the housewife, and produce in al- 
most endless variety breakfast and luncheon 
foods that shall be dainty and delicious or sub- 
stantial and hearty. 

Are eggs scarce and high, does too much 
shortening disagree with some member of the 
family, Royal Baking Powder permits the les- 
sening of both or either of these ingi-edients, 
without impaiiing the delicacy or digestibility 
of the finished biscuit. 

Royal Baking Powder is pure and healthful, 
and its use in excess can produce no harm ; yet 
for cooking results it is best to be guided by the 
quantity specified in the receipts. Baking 
powder could be added until a dry, powdery 
biscuit resulted. 

The mixing of the baking powder, flour, and 
other dry ingredients should be thorough. 
This is imperative if a delicate, evenly leav- 
ened biscuit is wanted. The other ingredients 
can then be added, following the special direC' 
tions as given in each receipt. 



THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER IS ABSOLUTELY PURE. 



THE ROYAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK 



In using shortening for biscuits, especially 
through the winter season, with some limita- 
tion, good, sweet home-made lard may take 
the place of butter. Butter will color slightly 
yellow; lard will whiten the biscuits. This 
substitution will not do when considerable 
Bhortening is called for, as in cake; but in 
receipts where the quantity does not exceed 
2 ounces or tablespoons to the quart of flour, 
butter may, in the majority of cases, be replaced 
by lard without impairing the taste. 

Biscuits are mixed to a soft dough, which is 
ttimed out, patted down or rolled to a proper 
thickness, and then cut out and baked. From 
long experience it has been found that the re- 
sult is much better and the food more digestible 
•when the finished biscuit is small and not too 
thick. The scientific reason for this is that the 
oven h eat necessary for biscuit, if they are made 
very large, will brown the outside before the 
center is as thoroughly baked as it ought to be. 
The dough should be rolled out until Mj inch 
thick ; the biscuits should be of medium size, — 
2 inches or less across, — and placed slightly 
apart in the pans. A favorite cutter of expert 
biscuit-makers is the open end (not the cover) 
of a V4 -pound Royal Baking Powder can. A 
good oven heat wiU bake the biscuit perfectly 
in from 15 to 20 minutes, and even a dyspeptic 
can eat them vrithout fear of consequences. 
The biscuit may, of course, be made thicker or 
thinner, as more or less of the soft inside part 
may be preferred, but the time of baking must 
be regulated accordingly. 

The same directions will apply to hot baking 
powder breads made with a batter. If baked 
in a sheet the batter should rarely be more 
than an inch deep in the pan, sometimes less ; 
if in cups or molds they should not be more 
than % full. This allows the heat to pene- 
trate the mixture quickly ; the moisture and 
heat start the baking powder into life ; each 
tiny grain of the powder acts on the materials 
surrounding it ; the dough or batter expands, 
then is stiffened by the heat, and all the starch 
grains are thoroughly and evenly cooked. 

Royal Hot Biscuit. — 1 quart flour, 1 tea- 
spoon salt, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 
1 tablespoon lard or butter, 1 pint sweet mUk, 
cold (never use sour milk) ; use cold water

almonds — and 2 tablespoons sugar; mix to a 
soft dough with mUk. Mold with the hands 
into small balls, place well apart on greased 
pans, brush each with milk, put a pinch of 
chopped nuts on top, and bake in hot oven.

Fritters and Waffles 

FRITTERS are served as a vegetable or a 
sweet, for a lunch, dinner, or supper, 
according to the ingredients used in mak- 
ing them. Whether sweet or plain, the foun- 
dation batt«r is much the same, and, with some 
additions, the first receipt given in this chap- 
ter can be used for many kinds of fritters. 
By the use of Royal Baking Powder a fine frit^ 
ter batter may be stirred up in a moment, and 
a meal which it may be thought necessary to 
extend, perhaps because of unexpected guests, 
can be embellished by the addition of a delicate 
and tasty dish. 

A fritter batter which is to be used as a 
medium for whole or sliced fruit shoiild be 
quito thin, as it is to serve as a cover for the 
fruit. When chopped fruits or vegetables are 
stirred in, or the batter is to be used plain, it 
should be thick enough to retain its shape 
when dropped by spoonfuls into the frying- 
kettle. The fat should be deep enough to 
cover the fritters, and it should be smoking 
Lot when used. Each fritter will at first sink 
to the bottom of the kettle ; then, as the heat 
starts the baking powder into action and the 
dough begins to swell, it will rise to the surface, 
and should be gently turned, the turning to be 
repeated until the fritter is finely colored. Most 
fritters are done within five minutes, the time 
needed to cook them being determined by one 
which should be cooked as a tester. 

The very word " waffles " brings to our minds 
a host of pleasant recollections. The only 
drawback, in the old days, was that they must be 
started so long before they were ready for the 
Irons, for home-made yeast took time to raise 
the batter to the requisite degree of lightness. 
Now, by the use of Royal Baking Powder, they 
can be prepared in five minutes. They are 
better than of old, too, for there is no yeasty 
taste to them; they are light, tender, and 
toothsome, and, what is most important, en- 
tirely digestible and wholesome. 

Plain Fritter Batter.— 1 cup flour, % tea- 
spoon Royal Baking Powder, V4 teaspoon salt, 2 
eggs, 1 cup milk. Sift dry ingredients together;

Fruit Fritters.— Any kind of fruit may be 
made into fritters, as directed for apple frit- 
ters. Whole canned fruits, drained from 
syrup, may also be used. Apples and other

Griddle Cakes, Etc. 



THE griddle cake as made to-day with 
Royal Baking Powder is another arti- 
cle of food which has taken high rank 
upon the American table. The heavy, sour, 
grease-soaked, indigestible griddle cake of old 
is, where modem methods are employed, a 
thing of the past. The properly made griddle 
cake is a delicious food, healthful, appetizing, 
and nutritious. 

Raising the griddle cake with yeast is alto- 
gether obsolete with expert cooks. Mixtures 
of soda, saleratus, sour milk, buttermilk, etc., 
are likewise not permissible. Royal Baking 
Powder has altogether redeemed the griddle 
cake. It makes the cake light, tender, digest- 
ible, and its preparation and baking ai'e the 
work of a moment only. 

Royal Baking Powder, plain, sweet milk, 
flour, and a little salt make a food fit for a 
feast. What so simple, so easily prepared? 
Eggs are altogether imessential. 

THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER 



The batter must be thin, the cakes made 
small and not too thick, — about a good '/fe inch 
thick when baked, — browned, and neatly 
turned. The griddle must be merely rubbed 
with grease, not grease-soaked. This is highly 
important. Take a thick piece of salt pork 
on a fork, or a lump of suet in a piece of 
cheese-cloth, and rub lightly over the hot grid- 
dle and pour the batter on immediately. 

Remember that buckwheat is one of the 
most difficult flours to lighten. Where it en- 
ters into combination with other materials this 
fact must be recognized and a somewhat larger 
proportion of Royal Baking Powder allowed. 
Made in the manner directed in these receipts 
buckwheat cakes can bo safely and profusely 
eaten by every one.

add to crushed wheat preparation when quite 
cold; mix into smooth batter. Bake on hot 
griddle ; brown delicately on both sides ; serve 
with hygienic cream sauce. 

Com Meal Griddle Cakes. — 2 cups com 
meal, 1 cup flour, ^<j teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon 
molasses, 2 teaspoons Royal Baking Powder, 
milk or milk and water to mis to thin batter. 
Bake as already directed.

Royal Buckwheats. — This is the most de- 
licious of all the griddle cakes. It has been 
against buckwheat cakes when made from 
yeast or risen overnight that it was difficult 
to make them light and sweet, and that dis- 
agreeable effects followed their eating. It is 
found that by the use of the Royal Baking 
Powder to raise the batter these objections 
have been entirely overcome, and that buck- 
wheat cakes are made a most delicious food, 
light, sweet, tender, and perfectly wholesome, 
that can be eaten by any one without the 
slightest digestive inconvenience. 2 cups 
pure buckwheat (do not use the so-called " pre- 
pared" or "self-raising" flours), 1 cup wheat

Cakes 

Flour 

FANCY-CAKE makers and confectioners 
prefer to use "pastry" flour f(5r the 
making of cakes and pastry, which is a 
flour of different grade from that used for 
bread and general baking purposes. Bread 
flour contains a large proportion of gluten, the 
nitrogenous property of the wheat grain, which 
gives bone and muscle, and makes bread a 
nutritious food. When bread flour is used for 
cake and pie crust the result is not quite as 
flaky and light as it should be, because of the 
gluten in the flour. A special sack of pastry flour 
for use in making fine cakes and pastry will be 
advantageous. In appearance pastry flour is 
whiter than bread flour. When rubbed between 
the fingers it feels as soft and fine as corn- 
starch ; if squeezed in the hand it forms a firm 
ball. Because of this tendency to " pack " it 
should always be sifted very thoroughly. 

Generally speaking. Royal Baking Powder 
used with any good flour will make satisfactory 
cake which will be creditable to any house- 
keeper. 

Royal Baking Powder 

In no department of cookery is Royal Bak- 
ing Powder of greater use and importance than 
in making fine cake. Eggs are too expensive 
nowadays to be used as lavishly as they were 
a generation ago — ten or more to a cake. Not 
as a substitute whoUy, but as an accessory, — 
as an aid toward producing the lightness and 
digestibility of the food, — we use the Royal 
Baking Powder. We thereby obtain uniformly 
good results and do a large amount of work at 
a minimum expense. The quantity called for 
by the receipt should be thoroughly mixed 
with the flour before the latter is sifted. 

The Royal Baking Powder has worked a 
revolution in cake-making. It is now no 
trouble to make at home the flnest cakes in 
almost endless variety, which shall rival the 
productions of the confectioner. If you follow 
these directions there will be no spoiled or 
heavy cakes, no wasted materials through fail- 
ures in mixing or baking. 

To Mix Cakes Containing Butter 

Cream the butter, beating tiU light. Gradu- 
ally add the sugar, beating till light and 
creamy. Add the yolks of eggs beaten till 
light, then the flavoring. Beat in alternately 
the liquid and flour, the latter mixed with salt 
and baking powder. Lastly, add the beaten 
whites, and fruit, if used. 

To Mix Cakes Containing No Butter 

Beat the egg yolks until very light and thick. 
Add the sugar gradually, beating till very 
light and spongy. Add the flavoring and 
liquid, if used. Have the whites of eggs 



whipped to a stiff froth. Add them alternately 
with the sifted flour (mixed with baking pow- 
der), and cut both in very lightly and quickly. 

To Bake Cakes 

Thin cakes need a hotter oven than loaf 
cakes. Cakes without butter (sponge cakes) 
should have a more moderate, longer baking 
than cakes of same size containing butter. 
The process of baking may be divided into 
four periods or quarters of time : in first quar- 
ter the cake begins to rise ; in second quarter 
it is still rising and begins to color; in third 
quarter it browns all over ; in last quarter it 
shrinks from sides of pan. 

To test, insert a clean broom-straw into the 
middle of the cake ; if it comes out clean, the 
cake is done. Hold the pan to the ear; it 
should scarcely " sing." 

Line loaf -cake pans with buttered paper; 
fruit cakes need several thicknesses of the 
same. 

Do not use sour milk, buttermilk, or any of 
the so-called prepared or self-raising flours.

any desired shape; cut some paste in thick, 
narrow strips and lay around your cakes so as 
to form a deep, cup-like edge ; place on a well- 
buttered tin and bake. When done, fill with 
iced fruit, prepared as f oUows : Take rich, ripe 
peaches (canned ones will do if fine and weU 
drained from all juice), cut in halves ; plums, 
strawbeiTies, pineapples cut in squares or 
small triangles, or any other available fruit, 
and dip in the white of an egg that has been 
very slightly beaten, and then in pulverized 
sugar, and lay in the center of your cakes.

THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER IS ABSOLUTELY PURE. 



These are Facts 

Which Housekeepers Should 
Seriously Consider 



IF you wish the best food, you will 
be interested in the following facts, 
which show why Royal is the best 
baking powder, why it makes the best 
and most wholesome food, and why 
its use has become almost universal — 
its sale greater in this country than 
the sale of all other cream of tartar 
baking powders combined. 

The Royal Baking Powder 
NEVER FaUs. 

It is absolutely pure and whole- 
some. 

It is combined from the most 
approved and healthful ingredi- 
ents. 

It makes the finest flavored, 
most tender, delicious and health - 
fill food. 

It has greater leavenmg 
strength than any other baking 
powder, and is therefore the 
most economical. 

It does not lose its strength, but 
Mrill keep fresh and of full leaven- 
ing power until used. 

It acts slowly in the dough, so 
that none of its strength is lost 
before the baking is completed. 

It makes food that will keep 
sweet, moist, and fresh longer, or 
that may be eaten hot and fresh 
without distressing results. 

The reasons why the Royal Baking 
Powder is superior to all others in 
these respects are easily stated. One 
is because it is made from chemically 



pure materials ; another is because it is 
made with greater care and accuracy. 
It is always uniform in composition 
and leavening power. It has been the 
standard baking powder for thirty 
years. All the knowledge and skill 
attained by nearly a third of a centu- 
ry's experience is available in its pres- 
ent preparation. The consumer is not 
experimented upon by amateur manu- 
facturers or unscientific mixtures of 
unknown strength and doubtful Lugi-e- 
dients. The Royal Baking Powder is 
always certain and equal in its work ; 
a teaspoonful does the same perfect 
work to-day that it did yesterday, or 
last week or month, or last year. 

While the last teaspoonful in a can 
of Royal is as good as the first, other 
powders lose their strength after being 
made a short time, and particularly 
after the can is opened. No baking 
powder except Royal has its gas so 
fixed that its leavening power will 
be retained in all climates, dry or 
moist, hot or cold. 

No great efforts are made by other 
manufacturers to procure pure ma- 
terials. 

When they do not use alum, or a 
mixture of aliun and phosphate, they 
use the ordinary cream of tartar of 
the market, which contains tartrate of 
lime and is frequently mixed with 
alum, phosphates, or terra alba. The 



Be sure to demand ROYAL Baking Powder, made by the 

ROYAL BAKING POWDER CO., New York, U. S. A. 



frequent tests by the Massachusetts 
and New York State Boards of Health 
show the great extent of this adulter- 
ation. Such cream of tartar makes 
impure, unhealthful, and imreliable 
baking powder. 

But experiments that cost many 
hundred thousand dollars were made 
by the Royal Baking Powder Com- 
pany to secure for its use chemically 
pure ingredients, and to devise meth- 
ods and formulas that would make a 
perfect baking powder. 

In the manufacture of this powder 
there is used more than half of all 
the cream of tartar consumed in the 
United States for all purposes. 

This is refined in the mammoth 
works of the Company (erected at a 
€Ost of over naif a milHon dollars) by 
special patented processes, by which 
means there are secured to the Royal 
Baking Powder exclusively ingredients 
absolutely free from tartrate of Ume 
©r other adulterant or inert matter. 

While there is no secret as to the 
ingredients used, the methods of 
their preparation, their relative pro- 
portions, and the manipulations which 
are indispensable to produce a powder 
so perfect in all respects as the Royal 
are unknown to or, because too expen- 
sive, unemployed by other manufac- 
turers. 

The exactness with which the active 
principle of each ingredient prior to 
mixing is ascertained by expert chem- 
ists, by which only can there be pre- 
vented an acid or alkali residuum in the 
food ; the actual prohibition enforced 
against the receipt into the works of an 
impure ingredient ; the care with which 
the materials are dried, coated, and 
prepared before their combination, 
and the precision in packing the pow- 
der so that it shall be delivered to the 
consumer in the perfect condition in 



which it leaves the factory, are some 
of the details never overlooked in ita 
manufacture. 

Are not the same means employed 
by other manufacturers? They are 
not. Ivlany have tried to imitate the 
Royal, but have never equaled it. 
Pure materials are not employed, care 
is not taken in their preparation and 
combination, while in the great ma- 
jority of baking powders alum is added 
to give them strength, while cheapen- 
ing their cost. 

No alum, amino uia, pIiospliates» 
or unwholesome or doubtful sub- 
stances are used in tbe Royal, 
while the superior purity and 
fineness of its ingredients are 
shown by the fact that it costs 
more to manufacture than any 
other brand. 

The gi*eat populaiity and general 
use of the Royal Baking Powder at- 
test its superiority. 

Scores of brands of baking powders 
have been placed upon the market 
since Royal was introduced. Most 
of these are forgotten ; none has 
achieved a general success, while the 
Royal has increased in popularity 
until its use is general in every city, 
town, and hamlet in the country. It 
is likewise employed exclusively upon 
the gi'eat ocean steamships, and has 
come to be the leading baking powder 
in Great Britain, France, Germany, 
South Africa, and other foreign coun- 
tries. Nothing but the superior qual- 
ity of the Royal Baking Powder could 
have effected this. 

Corroboi-ative of the foregoing are 
the official tests. These have been 
made without prejudice, by absolutely 
unbiased officers, have been elaborate, 
exhaustive, and should be conclusive. 
Prof. Tucker, State chemist of New 
York, whose thorough and scientific 
work in examining articles of food for 



Be sure to demand ROYAL Baking Powder, made by the 

ROYAL BAKING POWDER CO.. New York, U. S. A. 



the State Board of Health is well 
known, says the Royal is a " baking 
powder unequaled for puiity, strength, 
and wholesomeness." The State chem- 
ists of Massachusetts, Ohio, Michigan, 
Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, 
California, etc, etc., indorse it as su- 
perior to all other similar preparations, 
wbUe the United States Govern - 
ineut investigation, made under 
tlie authority of Congress, shows 
the Royal to be a cream of tartar 
baking powder sui)erior to all 



others in purity, wholesomeness, 
4uid leavening strength. 

The day has come for a rigid dis- 
ci'imination in the pm-chase of baking 
powders by the housekeepers. 

Health and economy demand the 
use of that brand ascertained abso- 
lutely pure and wholesome and of 
greatest efficiency. 

Those who have tested all thor- 
ouglily, use Royal only. If you 
are not using it, the facts here given 
should induce you to give it a trial. 



No other Article of Human Food has ever 
received such emphatic commendation for 
purity, strength, and wholesomeness, from the 
most eminent authorities, as the Royal Bak- 
ing Powder. 

No other Article used in the domestic econ- 
omy of the household has so many enthu- 
siastic friends among the housekeepers of 
America. ^ 

AVOID ALUM BAKING POWDERS 

Do not use alum baking powders. They may be lower in price, but they will prove more 
expensive, because they are low in leavening strength, and make unhealthful food. They 
contain besides alum all kinds of adulterants from terra alba to ground flint and sulphuric aoid. 

Prof. Schweitzer, State University, Mo. : "Alum in baking powder is dangerous and 
should be restricted." 

Prof. Johnson, Yale College: "Alum in food must therefore act as a poison." 

Prof. Geo. F. Barker, University of Pennsylvania : " I consider the use of alum baking 
powder highly injurious to health." 

Prof. Tucker, State Chemist, New York : " The employment of alum in bread making is 
decidedly injurious." 

Prof. Prescott, University of Michigan : " The use of alum in baking powder should be 
prohibited by law." 

Geo. M. Sternberg, Surgeon Gen., U. S. Army : "No alum powder is furnished to the 
Army by the Subsistence Department." 

M. K. Van Reypen, Surgeon Gen., U. S. Navy; "There can be no question that the 
alums entering into the composition of alum baking powders are seriously injurious to the 
system."

THE old-fashioned fruit short cakes were 
generally made with flour, soda, sour 
milk, and shortening, and were restricted 
to the strawberry season. We now use Royal 
Baking Powder for lightening them, employ 
all the fruits of the various seasons, and thus 
feast ourselves upon the delicate confections 
almost the whole year through. The short 
cake made with Royal Baking Powder and 
sweet milk is incomparably better, surer, and 
more healthful than the old-fashioned concoc- 
tion. Too much skill was required in combin- 
ing soda and sour milk. The milk had to be 
at just the right stage of sourness ; not a grain 
more of soda could be used than was sufficient 
to neutralize the acid in the niUk, or the cake 
would be yellow, with a disagreeable odor and 
soapy taste ; if too little, the cake was heavy. 
But even the young or inexperienced house- 
keeper will find that with Royal Baking Powder 
a perfect short cake is an easy and agreeable 
task. The baking powder only needs to be 
thoroughly sifted with the flour, so that it may 
evenly lighten the cake. Use sweet milk al- 
ways. For the old-fashioned short cake no 
eggs are needed, the dough being put together 
in the same way as for baking powder biscuit. 

Throughout the summer fresh fruit of all 
kinds can be used. With cold weather substi- 
tutes are found in tropical fruits such as ba- 
nanas and oranges, stewed fruits such as prunes, 
dried, and all varieties of canned fruits ; but it 
is better to keep the fruit short cake for those 
seasons when ripe, fresh fruits are obtainable.

THE ROYAL BAKER AND PASTRY COOK 



Doughnuts and Crullers 

THESE old-fashioned "fried cakes," as 
they used to be called, need the addition 
of Royal Baking Powder to make them 
light. By its use less shortening is necessary 
and the cakes are more tender and far more 
digestible. After it is mixed with the flour 
the other ingredients are added and the dough 
quickly rolled out, cut, and at once cooked. 
The fat should be in a deep pot (to obviate any 
danger of boiling over), and should be of suffi- 
cient depth to cover the dough when first 
dropped in. It shovdd be smoking hot, or the 
dough will absorb grease and be soggy. Not 
more than half a dozen should be dropped in 
at one time, or the fat will be unduly cooled 
and some of the cakes submerged during the 
entire cooking ; in which case the cakes when 
cooked will be greasy and not light. One 
or two pieces of dough should be cooked first 
as testers. When done the cakes should be 
drained on nnglazed paper, then rolled in pow- 
dered sugar.

rolling, and lay in an earthen dish and steam 
until the fruit" is tender. Serve with brandy 
sauce. 

Apple Dumplings, 2.— Paste, 2; 6 apples, 
peeled, cored, and sliced, 1 cup sugar. Line 
6 cups, well greased, with the paste rolled out 
thin, wet edges, fill with apples, some of the 
sugar, cover with more paste; put in shal- 
low stewpan, large enough to contain them, 
with boiling water to reach half-way up the 
cups ; steam thus 45 minutes ; turn out on 
dish, sift sugar over them ; serve with spice 
sauce. 

Apple Dumplings, 3.— Paste, 3; 8 apples,

paste, and bring them to top of apple and fas- 
ten ; sift sugar over them ; lay on baking-sheet 
and bake in hot oven 25 minutes ; serve with 
hard sauce. 

Berry Dumplings. — Use berries of any 
kind carefully picked, hulled or prepared, and 
make as for apple dumplings, putting 1 or 
2 tablespoons of berries in each dimipUng. 

English Dumpling. — 1 pint flour, 1 cup 
finely chopped suet, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon 
Royal Baking Powder. Mix and sift flour, salt, 
and baking powder. Add suet; mix to firm 
dough with ice-water. Knead for 2 minutes ; 
roll out Ml inch thick. Put a floured cloth over 
a bowl ; on it spread the crust. Pill with 
sliced apples mixed with sugar and a little 
powdered cinnamon. Draw up crust and cloth 
so as to completely cover apples ; tie cloth, al- 
lowing a httle room to swell. Drop in kettle 
of rapidly boiling water, with trivet at bottom 
to prevent scorching. Keep at a rapid boil for 

2 hours. If water stops boiling the dumpling 
vrill be heavy. Or place in steamer and steam 

3 hours. Serve hot with cream and sugar or a 
liquid sauce. 

Farina Dumplings. — 1 quart milk, 10 ounces 
farina, 3 eggs, l';^ teaspoons Royal Bakingr 
Powder, a tablespoon fresh butter, ^ pound 
flour. Bring nulk to a boil, stir in farina, and 



boil till well done, continually stirring. After 
cooling, stir in the melted butter and eggs 
previously beaten up, and last add flour sifted 
with baking powder and salt. Drop with ta- 
blespoon into boiling water, well salted; boil

place a pared, unpitted peach. Draw dough 
round to cover the fruit. Place in greased 
pan, brush with mUk, and bake 30 minutes in 
moderate oven. Serve with clear sauce. 

Receipts for making dumplings for a stew 
or fricassee frequently call for shortening. 
This is a mistake, and usually results in 
heavy, soggy dumplings. Heaviness may also 
be caused by a removal of the lid of pot or 
steamer before the dumplings are done. Flour, 
salt. Royal Baking Powder, and sweet milk 
are aU that are needed to make tender, fluffy 
dumplings of this kind. The dry ingredients 
should be sifted carefully together, then quickly 
mixed with the mUk. During the cooking the 
liquid in pot or steamer should be kept at a 
steady boil. No more batter or dough should 
be dropped in at one time than will cover the 
surface of the liquid or rest on top of the meat, 
for, if too many dumplings are dropped in at 
once, those underneath are sure to be soggy. 
The cover should not be lifted until the dump- 
lings are done. 

Dumplings for Soup. — 1 cup flour, ^ tea- 
spoon salt, 1 teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, 
sifted together. Add Ms cup finely chopped

Pies 

THE richest pastry for pies is called puff 
paste, and much skill and practice 
are required to make it flaky, tender, 
and very light. First-class puff paste wiU rise 
in baking to double its thickness and be in 
light, flaky layers and without greasiness. The 
novice must learn to handle it as lightly and 
little as possible in rolling and turning. It 
should be put in the ice-box as soon as made 
and stand at least twelve hours before being 
used. 

Pastry flour should always be used for pie 
crust. It is whiter than bread flour and when 
rubbed between the fingers it feels very smooth 
and soft, like corn-starch. Carefully sift before 
using. 

Where it is desired to have a plainer pastry, 
or one less troublesome to make and more 
economical, the use of a small quantity of 
Royal Baking Powder will give a light and 
tender crust. As in other cases, the baking 
powder must be mixed and sifted with the 



flour before the shortening is added. Sweet 
home-made lard may be used in place of butter, 
either wholly or in part, giving a less expen- 

THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER IS ABSOLUTELY PURE 



sive but equally good and light paste. Never 
use sour nulk or so-called prepared or self- 
raising flours. 

Paste for Pies.— 3 cups sifted flour. Mi tea- 
spoon Royal Baking Powder, large pinch salt, 

1 cup cream, Mi cup butter. Sift flour, salt, 
and powder together ; add the cream ; mix 
into smooth, rather firm paste ; flour the board, 
roll it out thin ; spread the butter on it evenly, 
fold in three ; roll out thin, and fold in three ; 
repeat twice more and use. 

Paste, 2.-3 cups flour, Mi teaspoon Royal 
Baking Powder, Mi pound beef suet, freed of 
skin and chopped very fine, 1 cup water. 
Place the flour, sifted with the powder, in 
bowl ; add suet and water ; miY into smooth, 
rather firm dough. 

Paste, 3.— 3 cups sifted flour. Mi cup lard, 
IMi cups butter, Mi teaspoon Royal Baking 
Powder, 1 cup water. Cut lard into flour, 
sifted with powder; mix into smooth, firm 
paste with the water ; place it to cool for 15 
minutes ; meanwhile press milk and salt from 
butter by pressing in clean, wet towel, and 
flour it. Roll out dough on well-floured board ; 
place butter on it; fold dough over it, com- 
pletely covering butter ; roll it out lightly to 
Ml inch in thickness, turn it over, fold each 
end to middle, flour it, roll out again; fold 
ends to middle, and turn it; repeat this 3 
times more, and use. If this paste is made in 
summer, put on ice after each operation of 
folding and roUing. 

Paste, 4.-5 cups flour, 1 cup butter, 1 cup 
lard, 1 cup water, Mi teaspoon Royal Baking 
Powder. Sift flour with powder ; rub in lard 
and butter cold ; add the water ; ttiiv into a 
smooth, lithe dough. 

Paste, 5 (Puff Paste).— 3 cups sifted flotir, 

2 cups butter, 1 egg yolk, a little salt. This is 
diSicult to make. The essentials are : A cool 
place to make it in, ice broken up in 2 shallow 
cake-pans, good flom% and butter, firm, with 
salt and buttermilk worked out. Sift flour on 
pastry slab, form it in a ring with back of 
your hand. Place in center the egg yoDc and 
salt ; add a little ice-water, and from inside of 
ring gradually take flour, adding a little at a 
time, as you require it, more ice-water, about a 
cup altogether, until you have smooth, fine 
paste, very tenacious and lithe. Place in ice- 
box 15 minutes, then roll out to size of a din- 
ner-plate ; lay on it butter, and wrap over it 
edges of dough, carefally covering it ; turn it 
upside down, roll out very thin; then turn 
face down — the face is side of paste next to 
rolling-pin — folding it in three, squarely ; re- 
peat this three times more, placing it in thin tin 
on the broken ice, and other tin containing 
ice o»i if, after each turn or operation oi fold- 
ing and rolling. By this method this diffi- 
cult puff paste may be made successfiilly in 
hottest weather. 

Paste, 6.-3 cups sifted flour, 1 large cup 
butter, Ml teaspoon Royal Baking Powder, 3 
tablespoons sugar, Mi cup milk. Sift flour 
with powder and sugar, rub in butter, add 
mUk ; mix into a smooth dough of medium 
stiffness.

and finest, leaving stems out. Peaches should 
be pared and cut in halves, and sweet, juicy- 
pears may be treated in the same way, or look 
nice when pared, leaving on the stems, and 
iced. Pineapples should be cut in thin slices, 
and these again divided into quarters. 

Floating Island. — 1 quart milk, 4 eggs, 
yolks and whites beaten separately, 4 table- 
spoons sugar, 2 teaspoons extract vanilla or

Canning and Preserving 



To this as well as to any cream may be added 
at will 1 cup fresh fruit or berries rubbed 
through sieve, Ms cup cake crumbs, or any 
variety flavorings and colorings desired. 

Water Ices. — Boil I quart water and 1 pint 
sugar 5 minutes. Add ^ box gelatine soaked 
in cold water, stir till dissolved and chill. Add 
1 cup lemon juice and freeze. 

All water i'cea are made in this way, varying 
the proportion of sugar according to the acidity 
of the fruit \ised. Canned fruit syrups may be 
substituted for fresh fruit juice. 

THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER 



CANNING. — The important points to be 
observed in canning are, to use only 
sound, ripe fruit ; to have hot syrup and 
air-tight jars ; to fill jars to overflowing and 
seal immediately. Jars should be scalded and 
tested before using. Patent canners greatly 
simplify the work. 

Pick over the fruit, stem, pare, cut, wash, 
etc., and pack in jars. Make syrup by adding 
Va pint boiling water to 1 pound sugar. When 
clear, bring to boiling point and carefully fill 
the jars. Stand in canner or on board in wash- 
boiler containing water up to shoiilders of

or till tender. Take from canner or boiler, add 
more syrup tiU overflowing, cover and seal 
immediately.

Preserving. — Preserves require from % to 
1 pound of sugar to each pound of fruit, and 
\i cup water to each pound sugar. The fruit 
should be simmered in the syrup until tender, 
a little at a time ; skimmed out into the jars ; 
when all are done the syrup should be brought 
to boiling point, jars fiUed and sealed. Hard 
fruits like quinces should be first steamed or 
cooked in boiling water till tender. 

Jams. — Jams are usually made with small 
fruits or with chopped large fruits ; they are 
cooked with an equal weight of sugar till rich 
and thick, then put into tumblers or small 
jars and sealed. 

Jellies.— Use equal parts of sugar and 
drained fruit juice. Mash and heat berries 
till juice runs readily, then turn into bags of 
unbleached musUn or 2 thicknesses of cheese- 
cloth and let drip. Measure juice and sugar. 
Boil juice 20 minutes. Have sugar in shallow 
pan, heat through in open oven. Add to boil- 
ing juice, boil up once, take off fire and pour 
into tumblers. Fruit like apples and quinces 
should be chopped and covered with water, 
then simmered tiU tender before turning into 
jeUy-bags. 

Spiced Fruits. — These are also called sweet 
pickled fruits. For 4 pounds prepared fruit 
allow 1 pint vinegar, 2 pounds brown sugar, 
^ cup wnole spices — cloves, allspice, stick cin- 
namon, and cassia-buds. Tie spices in thin 
muslin bag, boil 10 minutes with vinegar and 
sugar. Skim, add fruit, cook till tender. Boil 
down syrup, pour over fruit in jars, and seal. 
If put in stone pots, boil syrup 3 successive 
mornings and pour over fruit. Currants, 
peaches, grapes, pears, and berries may be 
prepared in this way, also ripe cucumbers, 
muskmelons, and watermelon rind. 

Soups 

SOUP STOCK is made from cheap, tough 
cuts. The meat should be cut in small 
pieces and soaked in cold water for 
half an hour to draw out the juices. Bone is 
added for the sake of the gelatine which it con- 
tains, and which will give body to the soup. A 
good proportion is 1 pound each of meat and 



bone to each quart of water. Use a kettle with 
a very tight cover and simmer slowly for a 
number of hours. Stock is better when mad© 
the day before it is to be used.

spoon mixed herbs, 1 tablespoon each kind 
chopped vegetable. Prepare meat as above, 
soak in water M2 hour, heat slowly and simmer 
3 hours, add vegetables and seasonings, sim- 
mer 1 hour longer, and strain. Next day r»- 
move cake of fat. 

To clear stock beat white 1 egg till frothy, 
add with broken shell to above stock when 
cold (after fat is removed) ; heat slowly and 
stir constantly. Boil 10 minutes without stir- 
ring ; set aside 10 minutes ; strain through 2 
thicknesses cheesecloth dipped in cold watar. 

Soups with Pastes or Vegetables. — Pre- 
pare and clear stock as above. In salted watar 
boU macaroni, vermicelli, barley, rice, tapioca, 
or other vegetables or dry material until done ; 
drain and add to the clear soup and simmer to- 
gether 10 minutes. Proportion, Mi cup cooked 
material to 1 quart stock. Vegetables should

disjoint chicken, slice vegetables, chop herbs, 
put all on with water to cook slowly for 6 hours. 
Take out chicken and beef; salt and pepper 
and put into jar. Strain soup, pulping vegeta- 
bles through a sieve. Season and divide it, 
pouring % on meat in jar, and setting in pot 
of hot water to cook, covered, 2 hours more. 
Heat the rest and skim ; put in sago, simmer 
for % hour, then pour out. When 2 hours

but do not make too large a cut so as to spoil 
look of fish ; wash thoroughly in cold water. 

THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER IS ABSOLUTELY PURE 



Great care must be taken not to break gall, for 
it would make fish bitter. Use good dipping 
or lard for frying. 

To Broil Fish. — Clean, wash, and wipe dry. 
SpUt so that when laid flat the backbone will 
be in the middle, or take the backbone out. 
Sprinkle with salt and lay, inside down, upon 
a buttered gridiron over a clear fire until it is

salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and lemon juice 
or a few drops of vinegar. Mix together 1 cup 
dry bread crumbs and 3 tablespoons melted 
butter; spread over top and brown in quick 
oven. 

This may be varied by using tomato, becha- 
mel, curry, or any other sauce, or by adding 
grated cheese or sliced hard-boiled eggs to the 
white sauce ; by baking in shells or patty-pans 
in place of the deep dish, or by covering with 
mashed potato or biscuit crust instead of 
crumbs. 

Broiled Salt Mackerel.— Freshen by soak- 
ing it overaight in water, taking care that the 
skin lies uppermost. In the morning dry it

drain and rinse them ; put 1 pint oyster juice 
in 1 quart vinegar over fire ; scald and skim, 
until clear ; add I tablespoon whole pepper, 1 
tablespoon cloves, 1 tablespoon mace, 1 even 
tablespoon salt ; scald a minute, then throw in 
oysters ; let them just come to a boil. The 
oysters should be pickled day before being 
wanted, as they grow tough after standing a 
few days in vinegar. 

Oyster Pates. — 1 quart oysters, minced fine 
with a sharp knife ; 1 cup rich drawn butter 
based upon milk ; cayenne and black pepper to

ters) and fry golden brown in smoking-hot fat. 

To Boil Lobsters or Crabs.— The lobster ia 
in good season from April to December, and 
should be purchased alive and plunged into 
boiling water in which a good proportion of 
salt has been mixed. Continue to boil accord- 
ing to size about 20 minutes. Crabs should be 
boiled in the same manner, but a little more 
than half the time is necessary. 

Deviled Crabs. — 1 cup crab meat, picked 
from shells of well-boUed crabs, 2 tablespoons 
fine bread crumbs or rolled cracker, yolks two

Bheiry ; cook 5 minutes ; add ^ cup cream 
beaten with yolks 2 eggs, stir till thickened. 
Take quickly from fire. 



Meats 

Broiling 

THE rules for roasting meat apply to broil- 
ing, except that instead of cooking it in 
the oven it is to be quickly browned, 
first on one side and then on the other, over a 
hot fire, and removed a little from the fire to 
finish cooking. Meat an inch thick will broil 
ia about 4 minutes. It should be seasoned 
after it is cooked. 

Frying 
There are two distinct methods of frying: 
One with very little fat in the pan, to practise 
which successfully the pan and the fat must 
be hot before the article to be fried is put into 
it. For instance, in frying chops, if the pan 
is hot, and only fat enough is used to keep the 
chops from sticking to it, the heat being main- 
tained so that the chops cook quickly, they 
will be nearly as nice as if they were broiled. 
Frying by the other method consists in entirely 
immersing the article to be cooked in sufficient 
smoking-hot fat to cover it, and keeping the 
fat at that degree of heat until the food is 
brown. It should then be taken up with a 
skimmer and laid upon brown paper for a mo- 
ment to free it from grease. 



Boiling and Stewing 

Fresh meat for boiling should be put into 
boiling water and boiled very gently about 20 
minutes for each pound. A little salt, spice, 
or vegetables may be boiled in the water with 
the meat for seasoning. A little vinegar put 
in the water with tough meat makes it tender. 
The broth of boUed meat should always be 
saved to use in soups, stews, and gravies. 
Stewing and simmering meats means to place 
them near enough to the fire to keep the water 
on them bubbling moderately, constantly, and 
slowly. Salt meats should be put over the fire 
in cold water, which as soon as it boils should 
be replaced by fresh cold water, the water to 
be changed until it remains fresh enough to 
give the meat a palatable flavor when done. 
Salted and smoked meats require about 30 
minutes' very slow boiling, from the time the 
water boils, to each pound. Vegetables and 
herbs may be boiled with them to flavor them. 
When they are cooked the vessel containing 
them should be set where they will keep hot 
without boiling until required, if they are to 
be served hot; if they are to be served cold, 
they should be allowed to cool in the pot liq- 
uor in which they were boiled. Very salt meats,

Roasting 

Wipe meat with damp cloth. Trim and tie 
into shape if necessary. In the bottom of pan 
put some pieces of fat from meat. Arrange 
meat on rack in pan. Dredge with salt, pep- 
per, and flour. Have oven very hot at first ; 
when meat is half done reduce heat. Baste 
every 10 or 15 minutes. If there is danger 
of fat in pan being scorched add a few spoons 
of boiling water. Allow from 10 to 20 minutes 
per poiind of meat, according as it is desired 
rare or well done. When done remove to hot 
platter. Thicken gravy in pan with browned 
flour, adding more water aa necessary and add 
seasoning.

lV<j pints milk, pinch salt, 1% teaspoons Royal 
Baking Powder. Sift flour and powder to- 
gether, add eggs, beaten with milk, stir quickly 
into rather thinner batter than for griddle 
cakes, pour into dripping-pan, plentifully 
greased with beef -dripping, bake in hot oven 
25 minutes ; serve with roast beef. 

Braised Beef. — Wipe and trim 6 pounds 
round or rump of beef without bone. Sear 
brown on all sides in very hot frying-pan over 
hot fire. In braisingpan or iron kettle put 
layers of sliced onions, turnips, and carrots; 
add bunch of sweet herbs, 1 teaspoon salt, % 
teaspoon pepper ; on this lay meat. Add 1 pint 
boiling water (or water and stewed tomatoes). 
Cover closely and cook 4 hours in moderate

Transfer meat to hot platter. Strain, thicken, 
and season gravy. The vegetables may be 
served separately if desired. 

Braised Veal Shoulder. — Have shoulder 
boned. FiU with stuffing (see Stuf&ngs). Pre- 
pare bed of vegetables as for braised beef. 
Lay veal on it, add 1 pint boiling water, 1 pint 
stewed tomatoes, Mj teaspoon salt, Vi teaspoon 
pepper. Cover and cook 4 hours in moderate 
oven. Uncover and brown. Serve strained 
gravy separately. 

Broiled Steak. — Trim and wipe steak, which 
should be at least 1 inch thick. Rub broiler 
with fat, arrange steak wdth thickest part in 
center of broiler. Have fire clear and very 
hot, but without blaze. Hold steak close to fire.

slices ; slice also a little raw ham ; put both in 
a frying-pan, with some butter and small quan- 
tity chopped onions; let them simmer together 
a short time on the fire or in the oven ; add a 
little flour and enough stock to make sauce ; 
salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and a little Wor- 
eestershore sauce as seasoning ; add also a few 
sliced potatoes, and cook together for about 20 
minutes; put this into a pie-dish, with a few 
slices of hard-boiled eggs on the top, and cover 
with a layer of common paste. Bake from 15 
to 20 minutes in a well-heated oven. All dark- 
meat pies can be treated precisely in the same 
way. If poultry, leave the potatoes out. 

To Boll a Ham. — A blade of mace, a few 
cloves, a sprig of thyme, and 2 bay-leaves. Well 
soak ham in large quantity of water for 2i 
hours, then trim and scrape very clean ; put 
into large stewpan, with more than sufficient 
water to cover it ; put in mace, cloves, thyme, 
and bay-leaves. Boil 4 or 5 hours, according 
to weight ; when done, let it become cold in 
liquor in which it was boiled. Then remove 
rind carefully, without injuring the fat; press 
cloth over it to absorb as much of the grease 
as possible. It is always improved by setting 
in the oven for nearly an hour, till much of 
the fat dries out, and it also makes it more 
tender. Shake some bread raspings over the 
fat. Serve cold garnished with parsley. 

Boiled Mutton or Lamb. — Trim and wipe 
the meat. Have ready kettle of rapidly boiling 
salted water. Immerse meat, boil hard 5 min- 
utes, then reduce to gentle simmer. Allow 12 
to 15 minutes per pound. Lamb should always 
be well done ; mutton may be rare. A little 
rice may be added to water to keep meat white ; 
if a few vegetables are also added the pot liquor 
will make a good thick soup. 

Boiled Corned Beef and Turnips.— Select a 
piece not too salt. The brisket is a good cut 
for family use when not too fat. Cook beef in 
plenty cold water. Bring slowly to boil. Cook 
18 minutes to the pound after it begins to sim- 
mer. When fully ?4 done put in a dozen tur- 
nips, peeled and quartered. When both beef 
and turnips are thoroughly done dish out the 
beef, and lay the turnips, unmashed, about it. 
Serve with drawn butter, having as a base the 
pot liquor. Remaining liquor will make a good 
soup for next day's dinner. 

Poric Chops witli Tomato Gravy.— Trim 
off skin and fat; rub the chops over with a 
mixture of powdered sage and onion ; put 
small piece butter into a frying-pan ; put in 
the chops and cook slowly, as they should be 
well done. Lay chops on hot dish ; add a little 
hot water to gravy in pan, 1 large spoon 
butter rolled in flour, pepper, salt, and sugar, 
and % cup juice drained from can tomatoes. 
The tomatoes themselves can be used for a 
tomato omelet. Stew 5 minutes and pour over 
the chops and serve. 

Sausages. — Have % lean and Vi fat pork 
chopped very fine, 1 pound salt, V4 pound 
pepper, and teacup sage to every 40 pounds 
meat. Warm the meat, that you can mix it 
well with your hands, do up a part in small 
patties mixed with a little flour, the rest pack 
in jars. When to be used, do it up in small 
cakes, flour the outside, fry in butter or alone. 
They should not be covered while frjring, or 
they will fall to pieces. They should be kept 



where it is cool, but not damp. To prevent 
sausages from bursting when cooking, never 
make a hole in them with a fork while turn- 
ing them. 

Fried Salt Pork.— Cut fat salt pork in thin 
slices and soak in milk for a few hours. Pour 
boiUng water over, drain, and fry until crisp. 
When partly fried they may be dipped into 
batter (see Fritters), then finished in the same 
pan, turning several times. 

Pork and Beans. — Soak 1 quart white beans 
overnight in cold water. Drain, add fresh 
water, and simmer gently till tender. Put in 
baking-pan and place in center, rind up, gashed, 
Mi pound fat salt pork parboiled. Mix 1 tea- 
spoon salt, Mj teaspoon dry mustard, and 1 table- 
spoon molasses ; add to the beans, with enough 
boiling water to cover. Bake 8 hours in a 
moderate oven, adding more water as necessary. 

Liver and Bacon. — Cut liver in ^<j-inch 
slices, soak in cold water 20 minutes, drain, 
dry, and roll in flour. Have pan very hot. Put 
in bacon thinly shced, turn until brown, trans- 
fer to hot platter. Fry liver quickly in the 
hot fat, turning often. When done pour off 
all but 1 or 2 tablespoons fat, dredge in flour 
until it is absorbed, and stir tUl brown. Add 
hot water gradually to make smooth gravy, 
season and boil 1 minute. Serve separately. 

Few people know that lamb's liver is as ten- 
der and well flavored as calf's liver ; it is much 
less expensive. 

Stew, Irish. — Time, about 2 hours. 2% 
pounds chops, 8 potatoes, 4 tiu-nips, 4 small 
onions, nearly a quart of water. Take some 
chops from loin of mutton, place them in a 
stewpan in alternate layers of sliced potatoes 
and chops; add turnips and onions cut into 
pieces, pour in nearly quart cold water ; cover 
stewpan closely, let stew gently till vegetables 
are ready to mash and greater part of gravy is 
absorbed ; then place in a dish ; serve it up 
hot. 

Brown Beef Stew. — Cut 2 pounds beef in 
small pieces. Melt some of the fat in a pan, 
brown in it "iS the meat. Put rest of meat in 
kettle with 1 pint cold water, let stand 20 min- 
utes, then heat slowly. Transfer browned 
meat to kettle; thicken fat with two table- 
spoons browned flour, add 1 pint boiling water 
and stir ; when thick strain into kettle. Add 
1 cup diced carrot, cover, and simmer. When 
half done add 1 pint diced potatoes. Season 
well with salt and pepper. 

Mutton Haricot. — Cut 2 pounds breast 
mutton in pieces, roll in flour, and brown in 
drippings. Transfer to a stewpan, and 2 sliced 
onions, cover with boiling water, and simmer 
untU very tender. Add 1 pint parboiled pota- 
toes or 1 pint boiled macaroni and 1 pint 
shelled peas ; season, simmer till vegetables 
are done. 

Brown Kidney Stew.— From a beef kidney 
cut off the outside meat in bits, rejecting tubes 
and purplish cores. Cover with cold water ; 
heat slowly till steaming, drain, add cold water, 
and heat a second and again a third time. To 
the drained kidneys add 1 cup brown sauce 
(see Sauces), season very highly with Worces- 
tershire and catsup, and stand over hot water 
for 10 minutes.

bone. After they boil and setmi is taken off, 
put in a little onion cut very fine — not enough 
to taste distinctly, just enough to flavor a lit- 
tle ; rub some parsley very fine when dry, or 
cut flue when green — this gives pleasant fla- 
vor. Season well with pepper and salt, and 
few oimces good fresh butter. When all is 
cooked well, have liquid enough to cover 
chicken, then beat 2 eggs and stir in some 
sweet cream. Line 5-quart pan with crust

Cold Slaw. — Prepare % quantity boiled 
dressing. While hot pour over 1 quart shaved 
•abbage, cover closely; set away till cold. 
Red cabbage may also be used. 

Cheese Straws. — Roll out pie crust, 5, 
very thin. Sprinkle with grated sharp cheese 
and a dust of cayenne, fold in throe, roU out, 
and dust a second time with cheese. Fold, 
roll out quite thin, cut in fine strips or straws 
with jagging-iron, lay on flat pans and bake in 
very moderate oven. 

Welsh Rarebit.— Select richest and best 
American cheese, the milder the better, as 
melting brings out strength. To make 5 rare- 
bits, take 1 pound cheese, grate and put in tin 
or porcelain-lined saucepan; add ale (old is 
best) enough to thin the cheese sufttciently, 
say about a wine-glass to each rarebit. Place 
over fire, stir until it is melted. Have slice of 
toast ready for each rarebit (crusts trimmed) ; 
put a slice on each plate, and pour cheese enough 
over each piece to cover it. Serve while hot. 



Eggs 



SOFT AND HARD BOILED EGGS.— For 
soft boiled drop into boiling water and 
boil 3 to 3 Ms minutes. A better way is 
to have water boUing in a saucepan. Take 
from fire, add eggs quickly, cover, and let 
stand off fire away from drafts from 8 to 10 
minutes, according to freshness of eggs. 

Hard boiled eggs should be simmered at 
least 20 minutes. This gives mealy yolks, 
which digest more readily than sodden ones. 

Poached Eggs.— Toast small slice of bread 
for each egg; trim and lay on hot platter. 
Have frying-pan partly filled with salted water. 
When simmering, carefully break in 1 egg at 
a time. Baste with the water until white is 
firm, take up with skimmer, trim edge of 
white and slip on toast. 

Scrambled Eggs.— Beat together 4 eggs, 
^i cup cream or rich milk. Mi teaspoon salt, V4 
teaspoon pepper. T\irn into hot buttered pan, 
stir till set. Serve on toast. 

Chopped boiled ham or other cold meat may 
be mixed with the eggs before cooking. 

Omelet. — Break 3 eggs in bowl ; add 1 tea- 
spoon cold water. Beat with fork till mixed. 
Add ^ teaspoon salt. Turn into very hot but- 
tered pan, shake and stir till eggs begin to set. 
Let form, fold and turn out on hot platter. 

Fancy Omelets. — Finely chopped cooked 
meats, vegetables cut fine, chopped parsley, 
etc., may be added to plain omelet and dish 
named according to what is added, as ham 
omelet, omelet with peas, etc. 

Orange or other Sweet Omelet.- Sepa- 
rate and whip whites and yolks of 3 eggs. 
Pour yolks over whites, add grated rind of 
orange and 1 tablespoon of orange juice, 1 table- 
spoon powdered sugar. Mix and cook as above. 

Omelet Souffle?.— Break 6 eggs into sep- 
arate cups ; beat 4 of the yolks, mix with them 
teaspoon flour, 3 tablespoons powdered sugar, 
very little salt ; flavor with extract lemon or 
any other flavors that may be preferred. 
Whisk the whites of the 6 eggs to firm froth ; 



mix them lightly with yolks ; pour the mixture 
into a greased pan or dish ; bake in quick oven. 
When well risen and lightly browned on the 
top it is done ; roll out in dish, sift pulverized 
sugar over and send to table. You can also 
pour some rum over it and set_it on fire, as for 
an omelet au rhum. 

Plain and Fancy Baked Eggs.— Butter 
small stoneware dishes. Carefully break egg 
in each. Add salt, pepper, and bit of butter. 
Bake in oven till white is set. 

May be varied by buttering dish and adding 
chopped parsley or ham, soaked bread crumbs, 
chopped onions, or a little stewed tomato.

Cookery for the Sick 

ALWAYS prepare food for the sick in the 
neatest and most careful manner. In 
^ sickness the senses are unusually acute, 
and far more susceptible to carelessness, neg- 
ligence, and mistakes in the preparation and 
serving of food than when in health.

THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER IS ABSOLUTELY PURE. 



ROYAL 

A STRICTLY PURE, CREAM OF TARTAR BAKING POWDER 

THE tests made by the Government chemists show that Royal 
Baking Powder is of the highest efficiency and usefulness as a 
leavening agent ; that it does not contain alum, ammonia, or lime, and 
is absolutely pure. The official tests by the various State Food Com- 
missions, Boards of Health, and official analysts show no other baking 
powder so pure, strong, and healthful. 

More ni health and physical discomfort result from unwholesome 
food than from any other one cause, and chief among unwholesome 
foods are the alum and other cheaply made baking powders. 

The market is full of low-grade powders, mostly made from burnt 
alum and phosphatic acid. The sale of these powders is urged by some 
dealers because they are bought cheap at wholesale and yield them 
large profits. Consumers should ask for Eoijal and take no substitute. 

Alum baking powders are classed as poisonous by the most eminent 
physicians. They cost but three cents a pound to make, and being sold 
at from twenty to forty cents, are also a commercial fraud. They cause 
indigestion, heartburn, dyspepsia, and diseases of the liver and kidneys. 
Consumers who value their health must be on their guard against 
these dangerous powders. It will be safer in all cases to demand the 
Royal and take no other. 

The housewife will find no possible substitute for the Royal Baking 
Powder. There is no other baking powder or preparation that will 
render the food so excellent in every quality. 

Instead of cream of tartar and soda, or soda and sour milk, the 
best housekeepers now use Royal Baking Powder. It is almost impos- 
sible for the housekeeper to procure pure cream of tartar. Professor 
Chandler, when president of the New York Board of Health, stated in 
an official report that he found upon investigation that nearly all the 
cream of tartar sold by grocers was adulterated with white clay, alum, 
or other hurtful substance. These ingredients are dangerous to health, 
impoverishing the blood, producing dyspepsia, etc. Professor Chandler 
strongly recommends the use of a well-known baking powder (like the 
Royal) in all kinds of baking as more convenient, economical, and 
healthful. 

Royal Baking Powder is sold only in securely labeled tin cans. 

Remember, in all old receipts where cream of tartar and soda or 
saleratus are called for, you can substitute Royal Baking Powder and 
get better results. 

The usual proportions, old way, are : 2 teaspoonfuls cream of tartar 
to 1 of soda or saleratus ; 

Instead of which use 2 teaspoonfuls of Royal Baking Powder, 
and mix it with the flour while dry. This powder is so pure and per- 
fectly combined that one third less will do better work. 

Never use so-called prepared or self-raising flours. They 
mostly contain alum, phosphates, or other injurious ingredients.
