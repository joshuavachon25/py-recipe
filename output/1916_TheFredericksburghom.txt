eOOKING AND eULTURE 

ON THE fEDERNALES 



The rolling prairie dripping with the violent tor- 
rential rains of Texas or seared and parched a dry and 
cracking brown by summers' drouth, the sparkling 
rivers with their sombre cypress borders or shady 
groves of walnut and pecan — know only woodland sounds 
of birds and beast that seek their cooling shelter, taste 
of the purling waters, browse on the succulent herbs 

and grasses or prey upon the weaker of their kind. 
* * * 

The nomad Indian prowls along these peaceful 
haunts, brings to earth the wild turkey with his bow 
and arrow, prepares the feast over the open fire and 
devours it resting on his haunches. After the meal he 
smokes his soothing "Calumet"', its brown leaves, 
prairie-yielded. He teaches the stripling redskin how 
to fell the bison — to prepare the deadly arrow with 
the venom of the viper, — all his lore is slaying — 
slaying, for food, for shelter, for revenge, or conquest. 

The first blow of the ax — tocsin of human progress. 
The pioneer has come to clear the land and build 
his rough log cabin. In the spacious fire-place swings 
the iron kettle with his rude trappers' fare; he rears 
a stalwart race, steeled to hard labor, untaught, un- 
lettered save for the woodland crafts, the hunt, the 
stream or skirmishings with Indian neighbors. 

In homespun cloth, astride on shaggy ponies, the 
lads and lasses wend their way to the log schoolhouse 
on the hillock, summoned by the peal of the forefather 
of all Texas school-bells. The master cloaks his lack 



— 6 



of learning under greater sternness, the text-book play- 
ing second fiddle to the ferrule. Homes on the first 
thanksgiving can boast of bounteous cupboards; the 
hardest years are past and there is time for feast and 
song, for ease and plenty. 

Thru snowy cotton fields, acres of corn and grain, 
traverse two tiny lines of steel on a ribbed bed of 
logs and the day at last has come that the last peg 
is to be put into the iron trail — a happy consum- 
mation ! 

The thriving town is decked with flags and 
bunting; schoolchildren, clad in sunday laces, sing 
welcome to the throng that has come to christen the 
first engine destined to draw the products of their 
fields and orchards to the great marts of trade. Bands 
play ajid feasts are spread ; the best of all that harvest 
yields is showered forth to tempt the appetite: huge 
cakes and fragrant pies and tarts, jellies and preserves 
all testify to housewives' skill; savory sausages, home 
cured hams and mellowest of cheese disclose their 
craft. 

There is loud rejoicing here for what has been 
achieved and there is too, a still and holy joy for 
what is yet to be — and a few dreamers see, — nestled 
among these lovely hills — a city bright and fair, 
peaceful abode for a happy, healthy and industrious 
generation, led by wise council, and crowned by the 
fairest of all temples — a perfect SCHOOL-HOUSE.

JELLIES AND PRESERVES, 



Fruit Jellies. 

With but a few exceptions, the rule for all fruit 
jellies is substantially the same. The directions given, 
if followed closely, cannot fail to produce a clear, 
sparkling jelly. If it should, after strict adherence to 
the recipe, prove watery, the fault is in the fruit, not 
in the method or the maker. 

Thin liquid jellies can often be brought to greater 
firmness if the filled glasses are allowed to stand in 
the hot sun. Sometimes three or four hours will 
suffice, at other times as many days may be required. 

Not until the jelly is at least comparatively firm 
should it be covered with waxed paper and sealed. 

MRS. OTTO KOLMEIER. 

Melon Preserve. 

1 lb. melon; 1 lb. sugar; rind of 1 lemon. 

Peel the melon and scrape out the red flesh, using 
only the hard part, cut into pieces and cover with 
vinegar 24 hours. Then drain and cover melon with 
the sugar for the same length of time. Take out and 
let sugar come to a boil, then add the melon and 
lemon rind. Boil until partly soft, take out melon 
and boil juice until thick enough.. Let cool and fill 
into jars. 

MRS. FRED. WALTER. 



— 128 — 

Crab Apple Jelly. 

Quarter, Avithout peeling or coring, ripe crab 
apples. Put into the preserving kettle, add water, not 
quite enough to cover the fruit, boil slowly until fruit 
is quite tender. 

Strain through a flannel bag. Measure the juice. 

To each pint of this, allow a pound of sugar. Place 

the juice on the stove, bring rapidly to a boil. Boil 

20 minutes, skim it, add the sugar, stir until it has 

dissolved. Boil about 10 minutes longer. Test by 

cooling a little in a saucer. 

# # # 

Blackberries, Mustang Grapes, Plums, etc., can 
all be made by following the above recipe. 

MRS. OTTO KOLMEIER. 

Peach Jelly. 

Select peaches that are not too sweet. Wash them 
and rub off the fuzz. Cut in halves; remove the 
stones. Crack a dozen kernels, and add them to the 
peaches. Boil until tender. When the liquid is 
strained and measured, add a tablespoonful of lemon 
juice to each pint of the jelly, and then proceed as 
in other jellies. 

MRS. WM. CRENWELGE. 

Fig Preserves. 

4 lbs. of peeled figs; 3 lbs. of sugar; one lemon.

MISS BERTHA OCHS. 

Peach Marmalade. 

To each pound of peeled and stoned peaches, cut 
in halves, allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar. 
Put sugar in your preserving kettle, add water to 
dissolve, let come to a boil. Add your peaches which 
should be g6od and firm so as not to cook to pieces. 
Boil carefully for about half an hour, lift out of the 
juice and arrange on platters and set in the hot sun 
to partly dry and toughen. 

Turn them occasionally. The next day heat the 
syrup to boiling, drop in the peaches, also about a 
dozen kernels of the peach-stones, chopped fine, and 
the juice of a lemon. Cook until the peaches are 
clear and the marmalade is jelly-like. Test it by cool- 
ing a little in a saucer. 

Pear Marmalade may be made by the same recipe. 

MRS. OTTO KOLMEIER. 

Pie Melon Preserves. 
Slice a pie melon in lengthwise strips, each about 
two inches long. Cover with equal parts of vinegar

MISCELLANEOUS. 



A Few Useful Hints. 

1. Never put knives with ivory handles in water. 
Hot water causes them to crack and discolor. 

2. Saturate ink spot with lemon juice, then cover 
with salt. Let stand in sun for several hours. 

3. Cut glass should be washed and rinsed in the 
same temperature, not too hot. 

4. Stains on the hands can be removed by us- 
ing salt and lemon juice. Mix lemon juice and salt 
together, rub this on the stains, then rinse the hands 
in clean warm water. 

META DIETZ. 

Warm Hands on a Cold Wash Day. 

If M^ashing on a cold day try this : Lay your 
clothes pins with sack in a hot oven until you get 
ready to hang out your clothes. You have no idea 
how it will warm your hands to take out the warm 
pins. 

MRS. OTTO KOLMEIER. 

Castor Oil a Pleasure. 

Children make no fuss about taking castor oil if 
it is given this way : Take 1 cup milk, 1' cup molasses, 
V2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup castor oil, 1 teaspoon soda, 2 tea- 
spoons ginger, a little salt and enough flour to make 
a stiff paste. Roll and cut out in shapes and bake in 
a quick oven. One or two of these are as good as a 
dose of castor oil. 

MRS. OTTO KOLMEIER. 



— 141 — 

Seven Rules for Stains. 

1. Remove mildew stains by boiling the garment 
in cream of tartav-water, and then laying in the sun. 

2. Equal parts of turpentine and ammonia will 
remove hardened paint from clothing. 

3. Borax will remove the leather stains made by 
shoes on light colored stockings. 

4. Lemon will remove match scratches from paint. 

5. Spirits of camphor wall take off peach stains. 

6. Ammonia will remove grease stains from white 
goods. 

7. Ether will remove stains without leaving- a 
ring on the material. 

How to Preserve a Husband. 

Be careful in your selection; do not choose too 
young, and take only such varieties as have been 
reared in a good moral atmosphere. When once de- 
cided upon and settled, let that part remain forever 
settled, and give your entire thought to preparation 
for domestic use. Some insist on keeping them in a 
pickle, while others are constantly getting them in hot 
water. Even poor varieties may be made sweet, tender 
and good by garnishing them with patience, well 
sweetened with smiles, and flavored wdth kisses to 
taste; then wrap well in a mantle of charity, keep 
warm with a steady fire of domestic devotion, and 
serve with peaches and cream. When thus prepared 
they will keep for years.

Strong men from 
little laddies grow 



if their food is absolute- 
ly pure and contains al? 
the elements essential 
to a healthy, all-around 
development. 

Millions of children in 
far away countries grow up 
into sturdy manhood and 
womanhood each year on a 
diet principally of rice. 

But not on "polished" rice. The rice sold 
generally throughout the United States is 
polished and coated with glucose and talc. 
It has lost some of its most important bone 
and muscle building elements. 

Give your children pure Comet Unkoted 
Rice — the kind that will help them to grow 
up into strong, healthy men and women. 
Try it — it has a new flavor they will like.

A New Idea in Baking 

Ordinary baking powders waste much 
of their strength in the mixing bowl. 
The new idea is a baking powder that 
rises in the oven while the baking goes on. 

Princine

does good work in the oven. The 
result is so much better that I guaran- 
tee you can improve any baking recipe 
ni this book with PRINCINE or I 
will refund your money.

Food Value of Crackers Greater Than f/ieat. 

Tliat the humble soda cracker when made from the 
best rav/ materials and properly baked contains more 
food units (or calories) tlian the same weight of porter- 
house steak is the deliberate conclusion of Dr. W. O. At- 
water of the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture. Dr. Atwater 
fully explains this remarkable fact in Bulletin 142 of the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture (Principles of Nutrition 
and Nutritive Value of Pood). He shows that porterhouse 
steak contains r,100 food units and the soda cracker 1,875 
food units to the pound.
