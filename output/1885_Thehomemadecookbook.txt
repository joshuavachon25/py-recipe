SOUPS. 



Bean Soup. — Soak one and a half pints of beans 
in cold water over night. In the morning di'ain 
off the water, wash the beans in fresh water and 

Cut into soup kettle, with four quarts of good 
eef stock, from which all the fat has been re- 
moved. Set it where it will boil slowly but steadily 
till dinner, or three hours at the least. Two hours 
before dinner slice in an onion and a carrot. 
Some think it improved by adding a little tomato. 
If the beans are not liked whole, strain through 
a colander and send to the table hot. 

Beef Soup. — Boil a soup bone about four hours, 
then t-ike out meat into a chopping-bowl ; put the 
bones back into the kettle. Slice very thin one 
small onion, six potatoes and three turnips into the 
soup. Boil until all are tender. Have at least one 
gallon of soup when done. It is improved by add- 
ing crackers rolled, or noodles, just before taking 
off. Take the meat that has been cut from the 
bones, chop fine while warm, season with salt and 
pepper, add one teacup of soup saved out before 
putting in the vegetables. Pack in a dish, and slice 
dovra for tea or lunch when cold. 

Celery Soup. — One shank of beef, one large 
bunch of celery, one cup of rich cream. Make a 
good broth of a shank of beef, skim off the fat 
and thicken the broth with a little flour mixed 
with water. Cut into small pieces one large 
bunch of celery, or two small ones, boiling them 
in the soup till tender. Add a cup of rich cream 
with pepper and salt. 

Chicken Soup. — Boil a pair of chickens with 
great care, skimming constantly and keeping them 
covered with water. When tender, take out the 
chicken and remove the bone. Put a large lump 
<jf butter into a spider, dredge the chicken-meat 
well with flour, and lay in the hot pan ; fry a nice 
brown, and keep hot and dry. Take a pint of the 
chicken water, and stir in two large spoonfuls 
of curry powder, two of butter and one of flour, 
one teaspoonful of salt and a little cayenne ; stir 
until smooth, then mix it with the broth in the 
pot. When well mixed, simmer five minutes, then 
add the browned chicken. Serve with rice. 

Clam Soup. — Select five large, plump clams, 
and after chopping them finely add the liquor to 
the meat. To every dozen allow a quart of cold 
water, and putting meat, liquor and water into a 
clean vessel allow them to simmer gently, but not 
boil, about one and one-half hours. Every particle 
of meat should be so well cooked that yon seem to 



have only a thick broth. Season to taste and pout 
into a tureen in which a few slices of well- 
browned toast have been placed. If desired, to 
every two dozen of clams allow a teacupful of new 
milk and one egg. Beat the latter very light, add 
slowly the milk, beat hard a minute or so, and 
when the soup is removed from the fire stir the 
egg and milk into it. * 

Corn Soup. — Twelve ears of corn scraped and 
the cobs boiled twenty minutes in one quart of 
water. Remove the cobs and put in the corn and 
boil fifteen minutes, then add two quarts of rich 
milk. Season with salt, pepper and butter, and 
thicken with two tablespoonfuls of flour. Boil 
the whole ten minutes and turn into a tureen in 
which the yolks of three eggs have been >veli 
beaten. 

Ego Balls. — Two hard-boiled yolks of eggs ; 
mix wth the raw yolk of one egg a little flour ; 
roll the size of a hazel-nut. 

Ego Soup. — Boil a leg of lamb about two hours 
in water enough to cover it. After it has boiled 
about an hour and when carefully skimmed, add 
one-half cup of rice, and pepper and salt to taste. 
Have ready in your tureen two eggs well-beaten ; 
add the boiling soup, a little at a time, stirring con- 
stantly. Serve the lamb with drawn butter, gar- 
nished with parsley and hard-boiled eggs cut into 
slices. 

Fish Chowder. — Take a fresh haddock, of three 
or four pounds, clean it well, and cut in pieces of 
three inches square. Place in the bottom of your 
dinner-pot five or six slices of salt pork ; fry brown, 
then add three onions sliced thin, and fry those 
brown. Remove the kettle from the fire, and 
place on the onions and pork a layer of fish ; 
sprinkle over a little pepper and salt, then a layer 
of pared and sliced x>otatocs, a layer of fish and 
potatoes, till the fish is used up. Cover with wa- 
ter, and let it boil for half an hour. Pound six 
biscuits or crackers fine as meal, and pour into the 
pot ; and, lastly, add a quart or pint of milk ; let 
it scald well, and serve. 

Fish Chowder. — Take a email piece of pork, 
cut into squares, and put it into the bottom of a 
kettle. Then take your fish (about three pounds 
will make a good-sized chowder), cut it into pieces 
(larger squares than the pork), lay enough of 
this on the pork to cover well, then a layer of 
potatoes, next a layer of Boston crackers split, on 
this pepper and salt. Above this put a layer of 
pork, and repeat the order given above until the 
materials are all exhausted ; let the top layer be 
buttered crackers. Pour on boiUng water unSfl

covered, and cover the kettle ; keep boiling half an 
hour. Five minutes before dinner, dredge well 
with flour, and pour on a pint of milk. This will 
make the genuine Kye-beach fish chowder. 

Tomato Chowder.— Slice a peck of green toma- 
toes, six green peppers, and four onions ; strew a 
teacup of salt over them. In the morning turn 
off the water, and put them in a kettle -with vine- 
gar enough to cover them, a teacup of sugar, one 
of grated horseradish, a tablespoonful of cloves, 
allspice, and cinnamon, each. Boil until soft. 

French Vegetable Soup. — To a leg of lamb of 
moderate size take four quarts of water. Of 
carrots, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, cabbage, and 
turnips, take a teacup each, chopped fine ; salt and 
pepper to taste. Let the lamb be boiled in this 
water. Let it cool ; skim off all fat that rises 
to the top. The next day boil again, addmg the 
chopped vegetables. Let it boil three hours the 
second day. 

Green Pea Soup.— One peck of green peas, 
four tablespoonfuls of lard, heated in the kettle ; 
put in the peas and stir them until perfectly green ; 
add pepper and salt, and pour in as much water 
as you want soup ; boil three-quarters of an hour, 
then add one teacupful of milk, thickened with 
one tablespoonful of flour ; put into the soup two 
or three young onions cut fine and fried a light 
brown in butter. Just as you take it up, add 
yolks of two eggs beaten in a little cream. 

Gumbo Soup. — Cut up a pair of good sized chick- 
ens, as for a fricassee ; flour them well, and put 
iTito a pan with a good-sized piece of butter, and 
fry a nice brown ; then lay them in a soup-pot, 
pour on three quarts of hot water, and let them 
simmer slowly for two hours. Braid a little flour 
and butter tpgether for a thickening, and stir in 
a little pepper and salt. Strain a quart or three 
pints of oysters, and add the juice to the soup. 
Next add four or five slices of cold boiled ham, and 
let all boil slowly together for ten minutes. Just 
before you take up the soup, stir in two large 
spoonfuls of finely powdered sassafras leaves, and 
let it simmer five minutes, then add your oysters. 
If you have no ham, it is very nice without it. 
Serve in a deep dish, and garnish the dish with 
rice. 

Plain Gumho Soup.— Take a piece of ham half 
tbe size of your hand, and a kiuickle of veal ; put 
them in a pot with two quarts of cold water ; sim- 
mer slowly two or tliree hours, then add two 
quarts of boiling water. Twenty minutes before 
serving, put in one small can of okra and as many 
oysters as you please. Season to taste. 

Lobster Soup. — One large lobster ; pick all the 
meat from the .shell and chop fine ; take one quart 
of milk and one pint of water, and, when boiling, 
add the lobster, nearly a pound of butter, salt and 
pepper to taste, and a tablespoon of flour. Boil 
ten minutes. 

Macaroni Soup. — Six pounds of beef put into 
four quarts of water, with one large onion, one 
carrot, one; turnip, and a head of celery, and 
boiled three or four hours slowly. Next day take 
off the grease and pour into the soup-kettle, 
season to taste with salt, and add a pint of mac- 
aroni broken into small pieces, and two table- 



spoonfuls of tomato catsup. Half to three-quar^ 
ters of an hour will be long enough to boil thes 
second day. 

Mock Turtle Soup.— Boil a calf's head with a 
slice of ham till it falls to pieces ; strain, and 
set away to cool. The next day ski'm well, take a 
soup-bunch of vegetables well boiled ; strain and 
mix ^vith the calf 's-head liquor, with a little of the 
meat from the head. Boil an hour before iising. 
Take two tablespoonftils of browned flour, mois- 
ten and sth" into the soup before putting in the 
force-meat and egg balls. After putting in the 
force-meat balls, let it boil up, and dish right 
away, ha\ang in the tureen two hard-boiled eggs 
cut in thin slices, and two lemons, also cut in thin 
slices. 

Mutton Soup. — Boil a leg of mutton from two 
to three hours, and season with salt, pepper and 
about a tablespoonful of summer savory rubbed 
fine ; add rice or noodles as desired. 

To Make Mutton Broth Quickly. — One or two 
chops from a neck of mutton, one pint of cold 
water, a small bunch of sweet herbs, one-quarter 
of an onion, pepper and salt to taste. Cut the 
meat into small pieces ; put it into a saucepan with 
bones in cold water, but no skin or fat ; add the 
other ingredients ; cover the saucepan and bring 
the water quickly to boil ; take the lid off and con- 
tinue the rai")id boiling for twenty minutes, skim- 
ming it well during the process ; strain the broth 
into a laasin ; if there should be any fat left on the 
surface, remove it by laying a piece of thin paper 
on top ; the greasy particles will adhere to the 
paper, and so free the preparation from them. 

Noodles for Soup. — Beat one egg light ; add a 
pinch of salt, and flour enough to make a Stiff 
dough ; roll out in a very thin sheet, dredge with 
flour to keep from sticking, then roll up lightly. 
Begin at one end and shave down fine, like cab- 
bage for slaw. 

Okra Gumbo. — Cut one chicken ; wash, dry 
and flour it thoroughly ; salt and pepper ; fry very 
brown in a skillet with a lump of lard large as an 
egg. Put it into your soup-kettle with five quarts 
of water ; add one onion cut up, and let it boil two 
hours ; add two dozen okra pods, and let it boil 
another hour. Season to taste and serve mth rice. 

Ox-Tail Soup.— Take two tails, wash, and put 
into a kettle with about one gallon of cold water 
and a little salt. Skim off the broth. When the 
meat is well cooked, take out the bones, and add 
a little onion, carrot and tomatoes. It is better 
made the day before using, so that the fat can be 
taken from the top. Add vegetables next day, and 
boil an hour and a half longer. 

Tomato Soup. — One quart of tomatoes, one 
quart of milk, one pint of water ; boil water and 
tomatoes together twenty minutes, then add th« 
milk and one teaspoonful of soda. Let it boil up 
after adding milk and soda. Season as you dO' 
oyster soup, with butter, salt and pepper. Pour 
through a colander into a tureen. 

Tomato Soup. — One quart of tomatoes, one 
onion, two ounces of flour, four ounces of butter, 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, two of salt, one-thira 
of a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, three pints o£ 



SOUPS— FISH. 



water, one-half pint of milk. Boil the tomatoes 
and onion in watei- for three-quarters of an hour. 
Add salt, pepper, sugar, and butter and flour ; rub 
smoothly together like thin cream. Boil ten 
minutes. Boil milk separately. When both are 
boiling, pour the milk into the tomatoes, to pre- 
vent curdling. Serve with square of toasted bread. 

Turkey Soup. — Take the turkey bones and boil 
three-quarters of an hour in water enough to 
cover them ; add a little summer savory and celery 
chopped fine. Just before serving, thicken with 
a little flour (browned), and season with pepper, 
salt, and a small piece of butter. 

Veal Broth. — Pick and wash a teacup of rice, 
and put into your dinner-pot ; cut up three or four 
small onions and add to the rice ; next, add j'our 
meat, which should be cut in pieces of about a 
quarter of a pound each ; let the whole be covered 
with water from two to three inches above the 
meat. V/hen it has boiled an hour, add a few 
small turnips and carrots, sliced, with a table- 
spoonful of salt ; a little before it is served add 
some parsley. This is a favorite broth with many 
people. It is very nice without the carrots. Some 
prefer it thickened with flour instead of rice. 

Vegetable Soup No. 1. — Scrape clean and slice 
thi'ee carrots and three turnips ; peel three onions ; 
fry the whole Avith a little butter till it turns rather 
yellow ; then add also two heads of celery cut in 
pieces, three or four leeks, also cut in pieces ; stir 
and fry the whole for about six minutes ; when 
fried, add also one clove of garlic, salt, pepper, 
two cloves, and two stalks of parsley ; cover with 
three quarts of water ; keep on rather a slow fu-e, 
skim off the scum carefully, and simmer for about 
three hours ; then strain and use. 

Vegetable Soup No. 2. — Seven ounces of carrot, 
ten ounces of parsnip, ten ounces of potatoes cut 
in thin slices, one and one quarter ounces of but- 
ter, five teaspoonfuls of tlovu', a teaspoonful of 
made mustard, salt and pepper to taste, the yolks 
of two eggs, rather more than two quarts of water ; 
boil the vegetables in the water two and one-half 
hours ; stir them often, and, if the water boils 
away too quickly, add more, as there should be 
two quarts of soup when done. Mix up in a basin 
the butter and flour, mustard, salt, and pepper, 
with a teacupful of cold water ; stir in the soup, 
and boil ten minutes. Have ready the yolks of 
the eggs in a tureen ; pour on, stir well, and serve. 
Time, three hours ; sufficient for eight pei'sons. 

Vermicelli Soup. — Boil a shin of veal in three 
quarts of water. Put in a turnip, an onion and 
one carrot, whole. Boil about three hours. Add 
£alt and a small teacup of vermicelli, and boil for 
three-quarters of an hour. Before adding ver- 
miceUi, strain through a colander. Keep adding 
water, if it boils away. 

Stock for Soup.— Have a large pot on the back 
of the stove. Put in lean beef, either after having 
been cooked or before, in the proportion of one 
pound of beef to one quart of water. Add pork 
rinds with all the fat taken off. This mav cook 
slowly two or three days. When cold, skirri off all 
the fat and put into another vessel. This stock 
may be used for all soups in which meat-broth is 
Jequired. By adding fwr thickening either barley, 
rice, sago, macaroni or vermicelli, it will niake 
.any of these soups. i 



FISH. 



Fish when fresh are hard when pressed by the 
finger — the gills red— the eyes full. If the flesh 
is flabby and the eyes sunken, the fish are stale. 
They should be thoroughly cleaned, washed, and 
sprinkled vrith salt. 

Before broiling fish, rub the gridiron with a 
piece of fat, to prevent its sticking. Lay the skin 
side down fn-st. 

The earthy taste often found in fresh-water fish 
can be removed by soaking in salt and water. 

Most kinds of salt fish should be soaked in cold 
water for twenty -four hours — the fleshy side 
tui'ned down in the water. 

Baked Fish. — Stuff it with plain dressing ; put 
in a pan with a little water ; salt, pepper, and but- 
ter. Baste while baking. A fish weighing four 
pounds will bake in an hour. Garnish vrith hard- 
boiled eggs and parsley, and serve with drawn 
butter or egg sauce. 

To Boil Fisn.— Sew them in a cloth, and put 
in cold water, with plenty of salt. Most fish will 
boil in thirty minutes. 

Boileb Fish. — For four or five pounds of fish, 
nearly cover with water, and add two heaping 
tablespoonfuls of salt. Boil thirty minutes, and 
serve with drawn butter. 

Pickling Fish. — Spice the vinegar as for cu- 
cumbers, put your fish in and let them boil slowly 
for a few minutes, until done, vrithout breaking ; 
then set them away for several weeks, and the 
bones will be entirely destroyed. 

Baked Black Fish. — Rub a handful of salt over 
the surface, to remove the slime peculiar to the 
fish. For the stuffing, two ounces of beef drip- 
pings, two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, and 
one ounce of salt pork ; put in a saucepan and fry 
brown ; then add a teaspoonful of chopped capers, 
half a saltspoonful of white pepper, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, five ounces of bread, and on© 
gill of broth ; then stir until scalding hot ; place 
inside the fish ; cut a quarter of a pound of pork 
in thin slices and lay on either side of the fish, 
holding in place by twine wound around it — a 
generous sprinkle of salt and pepper completing 
it for the baking-pan. Bake in a hot oven one- 
half hour, and serve on slices of fried bread with 
a sauce made of stock seasoned with one table- 
spoonful each of walnut and Worcestershire 
sauce, one tablespoonful of chopped capers, and 
one tablespoonful of parsley. 

Brook Trout. ^If small, fry them with salt 
pork ; if large, boiU and serve with drawn butter. 

Codfish on Toast. — Take a bowl full of 
shredded codfish, put this in cold water in a 
skillet. Let it come to a boil, then turn into a 
colander to drain. Turn into the skillet again 
with a little cold milk ; season with butter and 
pepper ; stir sm.ooth a tablespoonful of flour with 
a little cold milk ; add, and let it boil for a mo- 
ment ; turn this on to buttered toast on a platter. 

Codfish Balls. — Pick fine one quart bowl of 
codfish ; let it simmer on the back of the stove a 
little while ; then boil six good-sized potatoes, 



FISH— SHELL FISH 



mash fine, and mix -while hot with the fish thor- 
oughly ; season with pepper, salt, and butter ; add 
three eggs, well beaten, and di'op in hot lard ; 
swve in a napkin. Lay the napkin on a platter, 
and the balls on the napkin, to absorb the grease. 

Baked Codfish. — Soak the fish over night ; 
clean thoroughly, then put it into a stone crock 
and cover with water ; simmer until tender, then 
pick over and mash fine. Take two-thirds mashed 
potatoes, seasoned, and one-third fish ; mix well 
together, and bake until brown ; then make a sauce 
of drawn butter, into which cut up two hard- 
boiled eggs. 

Fried Halibut. — Place in your spider half a 
dozen slices of fat pork ; fry to a brown and place 
in a deep dish ; add to the fat three tablespoon- 
f qIs of fresh lard ; when boiling hot put in the 
halibut, which should be cut in pieces about three 
inches square and dipped in sifted meal ; sprinkle 
with salt, and fry a good brown. After the flsh 
is all fried put it into the dish with the pork, pour 
over it the boiling fat, add one tablespoonful of 
hot water, cover tightly and stand in the oven 
twenty minutes. 

Boiled Salmon. — A piece of six pounds should 
be rubbed with salt, tied carefully in a clotli, and 
boiled slowly for three-quarters of an hour. It 
should be eaten with egg or caper sauce. If any 
remains after dinner, it may be placed in a deep 
dish, a little salt sprinkled over, and a teacup of 
boiling vinegar poured upon it. Cover it closely, 
and it will make a nice breakfast dish. 

To Broil Salmon. — The steaks from the center 
of the fish are best. Sprinkle with salt and pep- 
per, spread on a little butter, and broil over a 
clear but slow fire. 

Pickled Salmon. — Soak salt salmon twenty- 
four hours, changing the water frequently ; after- 
wards pour boiling water around it, and let it 
stand fifteen minutes ; drain off and then pour on 
boiling vinegar with cloves and mace added. 

To Fry Shad. — Clean, wa.sh, wipe dry, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, dip in flour, and fry in hot 
lard. 

To Fry Smelts. — Wash, cut off the fins, and 
dry with a clotli ; melt a spoonful of butter and 
into it stir the beaten ycjlks of two eggs ; salt and 
flour the smelts a little, dip into the egg and but- 
ter, roll in grated liread-crumbs, and plunge into 
boiling fat ; fry until a bright yellow-brown. 
Serve upon a napkin, garnished with fried parsley. 

Cream Baked Trout. — Clean the trout, put in 
pepper and salt, and close them. Place the fish 
in the pan, with just cream enough to cover the 
fins, and bake fil^cen minutes. 

TURHOT A LA Creme. — Boil a nice fresh fish, pick 
out the bones and season with pepper and salt ; 
mix one-quarter pound of flour with one quart 
of milk, put in four small onions, small liunch of 
parsley and a sprig or two of thyme, salt, and one- 
half teaspoon ful white pepper. Put over the fire 
and stir until it forms a paste ; take off and add 
one-half pound butter and yolks of two eggs. 
Mix thoroughly and pass through a sieve ; pour 
some of the sauce into a baking dish and add a 
laye» of fish and sauce alternately until it is all 



used. Have sauce on the top, to which add bread' 
crumbs and gi'ated cheese. Bake half an hour. 

Baked White Fish. — Prepare a stuffing of fine 
bread crumbs, a little salt pork chopped very fine ; 
season with sage, parsley, pepper, and salt. Fill 
the fish with the stuffing, sew it up, sprinkle the 
outside with salt, pepper, and bits of butter ; 
dredge with flour, and bake one hour. Baste 
often. Serve with egg sauce or parsley sauce. 



SHELL FISH. 

Lobster Croquettes.— Chop the lobster very 
fine ; mix with pepper, salt, bread ciiimbs and a 
little parsley ; moisten with cream and a small 
piece of butter ; shape with your hands ; dip in 
egg, roll in bread crumbs, and fry. 

Lobster Cutlets. — Mince the flesh of lobsters 
flne ; season with salt, pepper and spice ; melt a 
piece of butter in a saucepan ; mix with it one 
tablespoonful of flour ; add lobster, finely-chop- 
ped parsley ; mix with some good stock ; remove 
from the "fire, and stir into it the yolks of two 
eggs ; spread out the mixture, and, when cold, 
cut into cutlets, dip carefully into beaten egg. 
then into fine baked bread crumbs ; let them stand 
an hour, and repeat, and fry a rich brown. Serve 
with fried parsley. 

Lobster Rissoles. — Boil the lobster, take out 
the meat, mince it fine, pound the coral smooth, 
and grate for one lobster the yolks of three hard- 
boiled eggs ; season with cayenne and a little salt : 
make a batter of milR, flour and well-beaten eggs — 
two tablespoonfuls of milk and one of flour to 
each egg ; beat the batter well ; mix the lobster 
^\^th it gradually until stiff enough to roll into

MEATS. 



In selecting beef, choose that of a fine, smooth 
grain, of a bright red color and white fat. 

The sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs, are the 
choicest cuts for a roast. Have the bones removed 
and the meat rolled, but have the butcher send 
the bones for soup. 

The flesh of good veal is firm and dry, and the 
joints stiff. 

The flesh of good mutton, or lamb is a bright 
red, with the fat firm and white. 

If the meat of pork is young, the lean wiH 
break on being pinched ; the fat will be white, 
soft and pulpy. 

Rules for Boiling Meat. — All fresh meat 
should be put to cook in boiling water ; then the 
outer part contracts, and the internal juices are 
preserved. For making soup put on in cold 
water. All salt meat should be put on in cold 
water, that the salt may be extracted in cooking. 
In boiling meats, it is important to keep the water 
constantly boiling ; otherwise the meat will absorb 
the water. Be careful to add boiling water, if 
more is needed. Remove the scum when it first 
begins to boil. Allow about twenty minutes for 
boiling for each pound of fresh meat. The more 
gently meat boils the more tender it will be. 

To Broil Meat well, have your gridiron hot 
before you put the meat on. 

In Roasting Beef, it is necessary to have a 
brisk fire. Baste often. Twelve minutes is re- 
quired for every pound of beef. Season when 
nearly done. 

Beef a la Mode. — Take a round of beef, re- 
move the bone from the middle, also all the gristle 
and tough parts about the edges. Have ready half 
a pound of fat salt pork, cut into strips as thick 
and long as your finger. Prepare a nice dressing 
the same as for stuffing a turkey. With a thin 
sharp knife make perpendicular incisions in the 
meat about half an inch apart, thrust into them 
the pork, and work in with them some of the 
dressing. Proceed thus until the meat is thor-

ougbly plugged. Put it into a baking pan with a 
little water at the bottom ; cover tightly and bake 
slowly four hours ; then uncover, and spread the 
rest of the dressing over the top, and bake until a 
nice brown. After taking up, thicken the gravy 
and pour over the beef. It should be sliced hori- 
zontally. Is good either hot or cold. 

BoiLEAF.— Take a piece of beef weighing six or 
eight pounds ; have the bone taken out, then rub 
it well with a mixture composed of ground cloves, 
allspice, black pepper, sweet marjoram, and salt, 
one spoonful of each rubbed fine. After the mix- 
ture is well rubbed in, roll it up tightly and tie it ; 
put it into a pot half full of water, with three or 
four potatoes, a carrot, two turnips (if small), and 
two onions, and let it stew six hours. 

Breakfast Dish. — Chop fine as much cold beef 
or mutton as is required ; add a pint, more or 
l&ss, of good soup stock ; season with pepper, salt 
and ground cloves ; thicken with browned flour, 
and pour boiling-hot over little bits of nicely- 
toasted bread. Garnish with slices of lemon, and 
serve at once. 

Deviled Beef. — Take slices of cold roast beef, 
lay them on hot coals, and broil ; season with pep- 
per and salt, and serve while hot, with a small 
lump of butter on each piece. 

Dried Beef in Cream. — Shave your beef very 
fine ; pour over it boiling water ; let it stand for a 
few minutes ; pour this off, and pour on good rich 
cream ; let it come to a boil. If you have not 
cream, use milk and butter, and thicken with a 
very little flour ; season with pepper, and serve 
on toast or not, as you like. 

Frizzled Beef. — Shave beef very fine ; put into 
a frying-pan when good and hot ; put in the beef,

Beef Heart. — Wa.sh it carefully and stuff it 
nicely, witli dressing as for turkey ; roast it about 
one and a half hours, and serve wth the gravy, 
which should be thickened with some of the stuf- 
fing. It is very nice hashed. 

Meat Crouqettes.— Use cold roast beef ; chop 
it fine ; season with pepper and salt ; add one-third 
the quantity of bread crumbs, and moisten with a 
little milk. Have your hands floured ; rub the meat

into a mould or deep dish to cool. Use cold and 
cut in thin slices for tea, or warm it for breakfast. 



Pressed Beef.— Cure a piece of brisket with 
salt and pulverized saltpetre for five days ; boil 
gently until tender ; press until perfectly cold. 

Beef Tongtte. — If it is corned, it should be 
soaked for twenty-four hours before boiling. It 
will require from three to four hours, according 
to size. The skin should always be removed as 
soon as it is taken from the pot. An economical 
method is to lay the tongue, as soon as the skin is 
removed, in a jar, coiled up, with the tip outside 
the root, and a weight upon it. When it is cold, 
loosen the sides with a knife, and turn it out. 
The slices being cut horizontally all round, the fat 
and lean will go together.

hind quarter, saw it into four pieces, put it into a 
pot, and boil it until the meat and gristle drop 
from the bones ; chop the meat very fine, put it in

the skillet a little lard and the steak ; peel and 
slice the onions, and lay them over the meat till 
the skillet is full ; season with pepper and salt, 
cover tightly and place over the fire. After the 
juice of the onions has boiled away and the meat 
begins to fry, remove the onions, turn the meat to 
brown on the other side, then replace the onions 
as before, being careful that they do not burn. 

Chopped Steak. — Take a sirloin steak raw, re- 
move the bone and all gristle or stringy pieces,

sized piece of butter, and when quite hot put in 
the steak, and fry brown on botli sides. Make

an inch thick ; make a stulBng of bread, herbs, 
etc., and spread it over the steak. Roll it up, and

and scrape the top of the bone clean, fry in but- 
ter and set away to cool. Put a piece of butter 
into a stewpan with three mushrooms and a sprig 
of parsley, chop fine ; stir over the tire until very 
hot, then pour over a cupful of white sauce — the 
yolks of three or four eggs well beaten. Stir con- 
stantly until as thick as cream, but do not let it 
boil. Dip each cutlet into it, covering thickly 
with the sauce, again set away to cool. Then egg 
and bread-crumb them. Fry lightly. 

To Fky Lajib Steaks. — Dip each piece into 
well-beaten egg, cover ^\^th bread crumbs or corn 
meal, and fry in butter or new lard. Mashed po- 
tatoes and boiled rice are a necessary accompani- 
ment. It is very nice to thicken the gravy with 
flour and butter, adding a little lemon juice, and 
pour it hot upon the steaks, and place the rice in 
spoonfuls around the dish to garnish it. 

Spiced Lamb (Cold). — Boil a leg of lamb, add- 
ing to the water a handful of cloves and two or 
three sticks of cinnamon broken up. Boil four 
hours. 

Stewed Lamb Chops. — Cut a loin of mutton 
into chops, cover with water and stew them until 
tender, keeping well covered except when skim- 
ming. When done season with salt and pepper, 
and thicken the gravy with a little flour, stirred 
until smooth, with a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut. Have pieces of bread previously toasted, 
and pour the stew over them. 

Mutton Chops. — Trim neatly, season, and dip 
each chop into a beaten egg, and then in cracker- 
crumbs ; put into the oven in a dripping-pan 
with two spoonfuls of butter and a little water ; 
baste frequently and bake until well browned. 

Mutton Chops. — Have them trimmed from fat 
and skin ; dip each one into beaten egg, then in 
pounded cracker, and fry in hot lard or dripping. 
It is still better to bake them very slowly in the 
oven. 

Haricot Mutton. — Loin chop fried until 
brown, dredge with flour, put into boiling water, 
or if you have it, weak soup ; cut carrots into small 
pieces, then simmer for two hours. Season with 
pepper and salt. Steak cooked in the same way 
is very nice. 

Capt. Chiraz Ragout. — Brown four table- 
spoonfuls of flour in a pot, then add a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut, with as much water 
as will make it the consistency of cream, and stir 
V/elL Cut up the meat — two pounds of lamb or 



mutton— not fine, but into pieces an inch or more 
in thickness and length, one-half teaspoonful of 
black pepper, a pinch of cayenne, with salt to 
taste ; then add one and a half pints of boiling wa- 
ter, and stii' well. Then one dozen and a half of 
large tomatoes peeled and chopped up, four car- 
rots sliced lengthwise, three onions, and one dozen 
potatoes. Boil slowly for three hours. 

Irish Stew. — Take mutton chops, cover well 
with water, and let them come to a boil ; pom' this 
off and add more water ; then a lump of butter 
the size of an egg, two tablespoonf uls of flour, one 
teacupful of milk, season, potatoes, and two small 
onions. Boil until the potatoes are done. 

Ragout. — Take pieces of mutton, veal, beef, or 
rabbit, cut into any size or shape desired ; heat a 
tablespoonful of drippings or lard in a saucepan, 
and when hot, fry the meat until almost done. 
Take out the meat and add a teaspoonful of 
flour, brown it, add a little lukewarm water, mix 
it well and then add a quart of boiling water ; 
season with salt and cayenne pepper, add the 
meat, three or four onions, and six or seven potar 
toes, partially boiled before being put into the 
ragout ; cover closely and stew until the vegetables 
are done. Take out the meat and vegetables and 
skim off all the fat from the gravy, season mor« 
if necessary and pour over the ragout and serve. 

Baked Ham.— A ham of 16 pounds to be boiled 
three hours, then skin and rub in half a pound of 
brown sugar, cover with bread-crumbs and baks 
two hours. 

Pork Steaks, Broiled.— Trim, season and roll 
them in melted butter and bread-crumbs ; broil 
them over a moderate fire until thoroughly done. 
Make a sauce of five tablespoonfuls of vinegar 
and half a teacupful of stock ; let it boil, and 
thicken with a little flour. Strain, and then add 
pepper and some pickles chopped fine. 

Roast Pork. — Select either the leg, loin, fillet, 
or shoulder for roasting. Make a stuffing as for 
turkey, or a stuffing seasoned with onion and sage. 
If the skin is left on, it should be cut into small 
squares ; otherwise, sprinkle it with powdered 
sage. Baste frequently ; and allow twenty min- 
utes for each pound. 

Ham and Eggs. — Cut the ham into thin slices 
and broil, and spread over it a little butter. Poach 
the eggs in salted water, and lay neatly upon the 
ham. 

Boiled Ham. — Soak twenty-four hours ; put 
into a pot mth cold water and boil gently for five 
or six hours ; take it off the fire and let it remain 
in the water until cold. Peel off the skin and 
sprinkle with bread or cracker-crumbs, and brown 
in the oven. Slice very thin for the table. 

Ham Balls. — Take one-half cupful of bread 
crumbs and mix with two eggs well beaten ; chop 
fine some bits of cold boiled ham and mix with 
them. Make into balls and fry. 

Ham Toast. — Boil one-fourth of a pound of 
lean ham, chop fine, mix with the yolks of three 
eggs well beaten one ounce of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of cream, a little cayenne pepper.

PORK— MUTTONS WEE T-BREADS. 



stir over the tire until it thickens. Spread on 
hot toast. 

Pigs' Feet Hash. — Singe and scrape the feet, 
then wash clean and put them into salt and water 
to soak over night, or for several hours ; then 
scrape again until thej' are perfectly clean, and 
boil them till the meat falls from the bones ; chop 
•with a knife, season with salt and pepper ; pack 
in a crock, and if the weather be cool it will keep 
some time. It can be sliced and eaten cold, or 
put into a skillet and fried until brown. 

Pig's Head. — Have the head nicely cleaned, 
and boil it till very tender. Chop it very fine, and 
season with salt, pepper, sage, and a little clove, 
while hot. Put in a deep dish, and cover with a 
plate that is smaller than the dish, that it may rest 
on the meat. Place on the plate a very heavy 
weight, and let it stand for twenty-four hours. 
This makes the famous " Pig's Head Cheebe." 

Pork and Beans. — Take two pounds of side 
pork, not too fat nor too lean, to two quarts of 
marrowfat beans ; put the beans to soak the night 
before you boil them i^ a gallon of milk-warm 
water. After breakfast, scald and scrape the rind 
of the pork, and put on to boil an hour before 
putting in the beans ; as soon as the beans boil 
up, pour off the water and put on one gallon of 
fresh water ; boil until quite tender, adding more 
water if necessary ; great care must be taken that 
they do not scorch. When nearly as stiff as 
mashed potatoes, put into a baking dish, score the 
pork and put in the center ; broNvn in the oven 
one hour. If preferred use corned beef instead of 
pork. 

Boston Baked Beans. — Put a quart of beans 
to soak over night ; in the morning pour off the 
water and add fresh water enough to cover, to 
which add about one tablespoonful of molasses. 
Put a small piece of salt pork in the center, almost 
covering it with the beans, and bake slowly from 
six to eight hours, adding hot water as needed 
until nearly done, when they can be allowed to 
cook nearly dry, or according to taste. 

To Fry Apples and Pork Chops. — Season the 
chops with salt and pepper and a little powdered 
sage and sweet marjoram ; dip them into beaten 
egg and then into beaten bread-crumbs. Fry 
about twenty minutes, or until they are done. 
Put them on a hot dish ; pour off part of the gravy 
into another pan, to make a gravy to serve with 
them, if you choose. Then fry apples which you 
have sliced about two-thirds of an inch thick, cut- 
ting them around the apple so that the core is in 
the center of each piece. When they arc browned 
on one side and partly ceokcd, turn them carefully 
with a pancake turner, and let them linish cook- 
ing ; dish around the cliops or on a separate dish. 

Spare Rms Broiled. — Crack the bones and broil 
over a clt^ar fire, taking care that the lire is not 
hot enough to scorch them. 

Roast Lamb. — Choose a hind quarter of lamb, 
stuff it with fine bread crumbs, pepper, salt, but- 
ter, and a little sage. Sew the flap firmly to keep 
iti place, rub the outside with salt, pepper, butter, 
a little of the stuflang, and roast two hours. Eat 
■with mint sauce. 



Mutton a la Venison. — Take a fat loin, remove 
the kidney, and let it hang a week, if the weather 
permits. Two days before dressing it for cooking, 
take ground allspice, clove, and pepper, mix them, 
and rub into the meat a tablespoonful of each 
twice a day for two days. Before cooking, wash 
it off, and roast as a leg. To preserve the fat and 
keep it in, make a paste of flour and water, and 
spread thickly over the meat. Over this tie a 
double sheet of coarse paper, well buttered. 
About a quarter of an hour before it is done re- 
move the paper and paste, return to the oven and 
baste, and dredge with fiour. It is equal to ven- 
ison. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. — Put on in boiling water 
with a little salt, boil two hours and a half, make 
a sauce of melted butter, a piece of butter the size 
of an egg, stir well with a tablespoonful of flour, 
then stir into a pint of boiling water, with a table- 
spoonful of capers. Put into sauce-tureen on 
the table, and garnish the dish vrith boiled cauli- 
flower and parsley. 

Breast of Mutton and Green Peas. — Select a 
breast of mutton not too fat, cut it into small, 
square pieces, dredge it with flour and fry it a 
fine brown in butter ; add pepper and salt, cover 
it with water and set it over a slow fire to stew, 
until the meat is perfectly tender. Take out the 
meat, skim off all the fat from the gravy, and just 
before ser\'ing add a quart of young peas, pre- 
viously boiled with the strained gravy, and let the 
whole boil gently until the peas are done. 

Sweet-Breads. — Take two large parboiled 
sweet-breads, put into a stew-pan with one and 
one-half gills of water, season with salt, black and 
cayenne pepper, put over a slow fire. Mix one 
large tablespoonful of bro-v\Tied flour, with a 
piece of butter, stir butter and gravy well to- 
gether. After stewing slowly for half an hour, 
set the pan in a quick oven, and when nicely 
browned place in a dish, pour the gravy into one- 
half pint stewed tomatoes, thicken with one 
dessertspoonful of flour ; butter, salt and pepper ; 
strain through a sieve into stevqian, let it come to 
a boil, stir till done, pour over the sweet-bread 
and send to the table hot. 

Sweet-Breads Broiled. — Parboil after soaking 
in salt and water, then rub well with butter, and 
broil. Turn often and dip into melted butter to 
prevent tliem from becoming hard and dry. 

Sweet-Breads Fried. — Wash in salt and water, 
parboil, cut into pieces the size of a large oyster, 
season, dip in rolled-cracker crumbs, and fry a 
light brown in lard and butter. 

Sweet-Breads Stewed. — Wash, remove all the 
bits of skin, soak in salt and water one hour, then 
parboil ; when half cooked take from the fire, cut 
into small pieces, stew in a little water till tender, 
add a piece of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, a tea- 
spoonful of flour, and boil up once. Serve on 
toast very hot. Another way is to prepare as 
above and serve with tomato sauce. 

Tra-s-elino Lunch. — Sardines chopped fine, also 
a little ham, a small quantity of chopped pickles, 
mix with mustard, pepper, catsup, salt, and vine- 
gar ; spread between bread nicely buttered. To 
be like jelly cake, cut in slices crossways.

POULTRY. 



How TO Choose Poultry. — Young, plump, and 
well fed, but not too fat poultry are the best. The 
skin should be fine grained, clear, and white ; the 
breast full, fleshed, and broad ; the legs smooth. 
The birds must be heavy in proportion to their 
size. As regards ducks and geese, their breasts 
must also be plump ; the feet flexible and yellow. 
For boiling, white-legged poultry must be chosen, 
because when dressed their appearance is by far 
the more delicate. But darker-legged ones are 
juicy and of a better flavor when roasted. The great- 
est precaution ought to be taken to prevent poul- 
try from getting at all tainted before it is cooked. 
It should be killed and dressed from eight to ten 
hours before cooking. Pigeons are far better for 
being cooked the day they are killed, as they lose 
their flavor by hanging. Care must be taken to 
cook poultry thoroughly, for nothing is more 
revolting to the palate than underdone poultry. 

Plain Stuffing. — Take stale bread, cut off all 
the crust, rub very fine and pour over it as much 
melted butter as will make it crumble in your 
hands ; salt and pepper to taste. 

PoTATAO Stuffing. — Take two-thirds bread and 
one-third boiled potatoes grated, butter size of an 
egg, pepper, salt, one egg, and a little ground 
sage ; mix thoroughly. 

Apple STUFFiNG.^Take half a pound of the 
pulp of tart apples which have been baked or 
scalded ; add two ounces of bread-crumbs, some 
powdered sage, a finely shred onion ; season well 
with cayenne pepper. For roast goose, duck, &c. 

Chestnut Stuffing.— Boil the chestnuts and 
shell them, then blanch them and boil until soft : 
mash them fine and mix -with a little sweet cream, 
some bread-crumbs, pepper and salt. For turkey. 

Roast Turkey. — A turkey weighing not more 
than eight or nine pounds (young) is the best. 
Wash and clean thoroughly, wiping dry, as moist- 
ure will spoil the stuffing. Take one small loaf of 
bread gi-ated fine, rub into it a piece of butter the 
size of an egg, one small teaspoon of pepper and 
one of salt ; sage, if liked. Rub all together, and 
fill only the breast of the turkey, sewing up so 
that the stuffing can not cook out. Always put 
the giblets under the side of the fowl, so they will 
not dry up. Rub salt and pepper on the outside ; 
put into dripping-pan with one teacupful of wa- 
ter, basting often, turning it till brown all over. 
Bake about three hours. Have left in the chop- 
ping- bowl a little stuffing ; take out the giblets 
and chop fine, After taking out the turkey, put 
in a large tablespoon of flour ; stir until brown. 
Put the giblets into a gravy-boat, and pour over 
them the gravy. 

Boiled Turkey. — Soak it in salt and water for 
an hour and a half, to make it white. Make the 
stuffing of bread ci-umbs and about half the 
quantity of suet, a little parsley and a little 
lemon peel, chopped fine. Scald the parsley, in 
order to have it green. Put all these in the 
breast. Tie lightly in a cloth, and boil. A young 
turkey will boil in two hours ; an older one will o"f 



course require a longer time. Garnish with, 
parsley and lemon cut in slices. 

Boiled Turkey. — Stuff the turkey as for roast- 
ing. A very nice dressing is made by chopping^ 
half a pint of oysters and mixing them with bread- 
crumbs, butter, pepper, salt, thyme, and wet with 
milk or water. Baste about the turkey a thin 
cloth, the inside of which has been dredged with 
flour, and put it to boil in cold water with a tea- 
spoonful of salt in it. Let a large turkey simmer 
for three hours. Skim while boiling. Serve with 
oyster sauce, made by adding to a cupful of the 
liquor in which the turkey was boiled the same 
quantity of milk and eight oysters chopped fine ; 
season with minced parsley, stu' in a spoonful of 
rice or wheat flour wet with cold milk ; a table- 
spoonful of butter. Boil up once and pour into a 
tureen. 

Turkey Dressed with Oysters. — For a ten- 
pound tm'key take two pints of bread-crumbs, half 
a teacupful of butter cut in bits (not melted), one 
teasi)oonful of powdered thyme or summer savory, 
pepper, salt, and mix thoroughly. Rub the turkey- 
well inside and out with salt and pepper, then fill 
with first a spoonful of crumbs, then a few well- 
drained oysters, using half a can for a turkey. 
Strain the oyster liquor and use to baste the tur- 
key. Cook the giblets in the pan, and chop fine 
for the gravy. A fowl of this size will require 
three hours in a moderate oven. 

Turkey Scallop. — Pick the meat from the 
bones of cold turkey, and chop it fine. Put a 
layer of bread-crumbs on the bottom of a buttered 
dish, moisten them with a little milk, then put in 
a layer of turkey with some of the filling, and cut 
small pieces of butter over the top ; sprinkle with 
pepper and salt ; then another layer of bread- 
crumbs, and so on until the dish is nearly full ; add 
a little hot water to the gravy left from the turkey, 
and pour over it. Then take two eggs, two table- 
spoonfuls of milk, one of melted butter, a little 
salt, and cracker crumbs as much as will make it 
thick enough to spread on with a knife, put bits 
of butter over it, and cover with a plate. Bake 
three-quarters of an hour. About ten minutes 
before serving, remove the plate and let it brown. 

Curried Chicken. — Fry out in the pot you 
make the curry three large rashers of pickled 
pork and three onions sliced ; fry until the onions- 
are brown ; cut the chicken into small pieces, and 
slice three potatoes thin ; add them to the pork 
and onions, cover well with water, cook until the 
chicken is done and the potatoes have thickened 
the water ; salt to taste. Put two tablespoonfuls 
of curry powder in a tumbler, and mix with water. 
Slice two or three more potatoes very thin ; add 
the potatoes and mixed powder to the stew and 
boil until the potatoes are cooked but not broken. 
Serve with rice. The above is for one extra large 
chicken or two small ones. Green peas and corn 
are a valuable addition. 

Stewed Chicken with Oysters. — Season and 
stew a chicken in a quart of water until veiy 
tender; take it out on a hot dish and keep it 
warm ; then put into the liquor a lump of butter 
the size of an egg ; mix a little flour and water 
smooth and make thick gravy, season well with 
pepper and salt and let it come to a boil. Have

CHICKEN PIE— FRICASSEED CHICKEN. 



ready a quart of oysters picked over, and put them 
in witliout any liquor ; stir tliem round, and as 
soon as they are cooked, pour all over the chicken. 

Chicken Pie. — Stew chicken till tender, season 
with one-quarter of a pound of butter, salt and 
pepper; line the sides of a pie-dish with a rich 
orust, pour in the stewed chicken, and cover 
loosely with a crust, first cutting a hole in the 
center. Have ready a can of oysters ; heat the 
liquor, thicken with a little Hour and water, and 
aeason with salt, pepper, and butter the size of an 
egg. When it comes to a boil, pour it over the 
Oysters, and, about twenty minutes before the pie 
ib done, lift the top crust and put them in. 

Fried Chicken. — Joint young, tender chickens ; 
if old, put in a stew-pan with a little water, and 
simmer gently till tender ; season with salt and 
pepper, dip into flour, and fry in hot lard and 
butter until nicely browned. Lay on a hot platter 
and take the liquor in which the chicken was 
stewed, turn into the ft-ying-pan -with the browned 
gravy, stir in a little flour ; when it has boiled, stir 
in a teacup of rich, sweet cream, and pour over 
the chicken. 

Pressed Chicken (or Veal). — Boil three chick- 
ens until the meat comes off the bones ; then, 
removing all bones, etc., chop, not very fine ; add 
a piece of butter as large as an egg, salt and pep- 
per to season well. Have about a pint of the 
broth, into which put one-half box gelatine until 
dissolved ; then put back the chopped chicken and 
cook until the broth is evenly absorbed. Press 
lindcr a weight in a pan until cold. 

Jellied Chicken oh Veal. — Boil a chicken in 
as little water as possible, until the meat falls from 
the bones ; chop rather fine, and season with pep- 
per and salt ; put in a mould a layer of the chop- 
ped meat and then a layer of hard-boiled eggs cut 
m slices ; then layers of meat and egg alternately 
until the mould is nearly full ; boil dowTi the liquor 
left in the pot one-half ; while warm, add one- 
quarter of an ounce of gelatine, and when dis- 
solved pour into the mould over the meat. Set in 
;i cool place over night, to jelly. 

Chicken PoT-PiE. — Cut and joint a large chicken. 
Cover with water, and let it boil gently until 
tender. Season with salt and pepper, and thicken 
the gravy with two tablespoonfuls of flour mixed 
smooth in a piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Have ready nice light bread dough ; cut with a 
biscuit-cutter about an inch thick ; drop this into 
the boiling gravy, having previously removed the 
chicken to a hot platter, cover, and let it boil from 
one-half to three-cjuartcrs of an hour. To ascer- 
tain whi;ther they are done or not, stick into one 
of them a fork, and if it comes out clean, they are 
done. Lay on the platter with the chicken, pour 
over the gravy, and serve. 

Broiled Chicken. — Only young, tender chickens 
are nice broiled. After cleaning and washing 
them, split down the bacik, wipe dry, season with 
salt and pepper, and lay them inside down on a 
hot gridiron over a bed of bright coals. Broil until 
nicely l^rowned and well cooked through, watch- 
ing and turning to prevent burning. Broil with 
them a little salt pork, cut in thin slices. After 
taking them from the gridiron, work into them 



plenty of butter, and serve, garnished with tb« 
pork, slices of lemon, and parsley. 

Chicken Croquettes. — One cold, boiled chicken 
chopped fine ; then take a pint of sweet milk, and 
when the milk is boiled, stir into it two large 
tablespoonfuls of flour, made thin in a little cold 
milk ; after the flour is well cooked with the milk, 
put in a piece of butter the size of an egg, add 
salt and cayenrie pepper ; stir all well into the 
chicken ; roll up with your hand, and dip first into 
an egg laeaten up, then into crackers rolled fine, 
and fry in hot tallow (fresh tallow, half and half 
lard, is very nice). 

Baked Chicken. — Split open in the back, season 
with salt and pepper and plenty of butter. Pour 
a little water into the pan, and, while baking, 
baste often, turning the chicken so as to nicely 
brown all over. When done, take up the chicken ; 
thicken the gravy with a little floLir, and serve in 
a gravy boat. Chickens are nice stuffed and baked 
in the same manner as turkey. 

A Nice Way to Cook Chicken. — Cut the cEick- 
en up, put into a pan, and cover with water. Let 
it stew as usual. When done, make a thickening 
of cream and flour. Add butter, pepper and salt. 
Have ready a nice shortcake, baked and cut in 
squares, rolled thin as for crust. Lay the cakes 
on the dish, and pour the chicken and gravy over 
them while hot. 

Chicken Pudding. — Cut up the chickens and 
stew until tender. Then take them from the 
gravy, and spread on a flat dish to cool, having 
first well seasoned them with butter, pepper and 
salt. Make a batter of one quart of milk, three 
cups of flour, three tablespoonfuls of melted but- 
ter, one half teaspoon of soda, one teaspoon of 
cream tartar, a little salt. Butter a pudding dish 
and put a layer of the chicken at the bottom, and 
then a cupful of the batter over it. Proceed till the 
dish is full. The batter must form the crust.

and a little salt ; stir all together, add some sweet 
cream, enough to make it quite moist, cover with 
crumbs, put it into scallop shells or a flat dish, put 
a little butter on top, and brown before the fire or 
front of a range. 

Boiled Chicken. — The same as boiled turkey. 
They can be stuffed or not, as desired. 

Croquettes. — Chop fine any cold pieces of 
cooked meat or cliicken, or whatever you may 
wish to use, first removing all fat, bone, etc. ; add 
half the quantity of fine bread-crumbs, one egg, 
pepper and salt ; make into balls and cook in a 
buttered spider ; serve hot. 

Fricasseed Chicken. — Stuff two chickens as if 
to boil, put in a pot, do not quite cover with water, 
put them on two hours before dinner ; chop an 
onion, some parsley, and a little mace, rub a piece 
of butter twice as large as an egg with flour and 
stir it all in. Before dishing, beat the yolks of six 
eggs, and stir in carefully ; cook five minutes. 

Poultry Croquette. — Melt a bit of butter in a 
stew-pan ; put into it chopped parsley, mushrooms.

two spoonfuls of flour, salt and pepper to taste. 
Fry it, and pour in stock and a little cream. This 
sauce ought to have the consistency of thick cream. 
Cut up any poultry which has been cooked the 
day before into dice. Put into a saucepan, and 
let get cold. Form into balls and cover them with 
bread-crumbs. Wash in eggs which have been 
beaten up, and roll in bread-crumbs a second 
time. Drop in boiling lard, and fry to a good 
color. Garnish with parsley. Croquette made of 
veal may be prepared in the same way. 

Minced Fowls. — Remove from the bones all the 
flesh of either cold, roast, or boiled fowls. Clean 
it from the skin, and keep covered from the air 
until ready for use. Boil the bones and skin 
with three-foui'ths of a pint of water until re- 
duced quite half. Strain the gi'avy and let cool. 
Next, having first skimmed off the fat, put it into 
a clean saucepan with a half cup of cream, three 
ounces of butter, well mixed with one tablespoon 
of flour. Keep these stirred until they boil. Then 
put in the fowl, finely minced with three hard- 
boiled eggs, chopped, and sufiBcient salt and 
pepper to season. Shake the mince over the fire 
until just ready to boil. Dish it on hot toast, and 
serve. 

Roast Duck. — Prepare the same as for turkey, 
adding to the dressing two or three finely-chopped 
onions. Serve with apple saAice or cranberries. 

Roast Goose. — Two ounces of onions and half 
as much green sage, chopped fine, and one coffee- 
cup of bread crumbs, a little pepper and salt, the 
yolks of two eggs. Do not quite fill the goose, 
but leave room to swell. Roast from one hour 
and a half to two hours, and serve with gravy and 
apple sauce. 



GAME. 



Broiled Venison Steak. — Broil quickly over a 
clear fire, and when sufiSciently done pour over 
two tablespoonfuls of currant jelly, melted with a 
piece of butter. Pepper and salt to season. Eat 
while hot, on hot plates. 

To CooK Venison. — Broil as you would a beef- 
steak, rare. Have ready a gravy of butter, pepper 
and salt, and a very little water. Heat the gravy 
without boiling it. Score the steak all over, put 
it in the gravy and cover tight ; keep hot enough 
to steam the meat, and send in a covered dish to 
table. 

Pigeon Compote. — Truss six pigeons as for 
boihng. Grate the crumbs of a small loaf of 
bread, scrape one pound of fat bacon, chop thyme, 
parsley, an onion and lemon — peel fine — and 
season with salt and pepper ; mix it up with 
two eggs ; put this force-meat into the craws 
of the pigeons, lard the breasts and fry brown ; 
place them in a stewpan with some beef stock 
and stew them three-quarters of an hour, thicken 
with a piece of butter rolled in fiour. Serve with 
force-meat balls around the dish and strain the 
gravy on to the pigeons. 

To Roast Wild Fowl.— The flavor is best pre- 
served without stuffing. Put pepper, salt and a 



piece of butter into ea«h. Wild fowl require 
much less dressing than tame. They should be 
served of a fine color with a rich brown gravy. 
To take off the fishy taste which wild fowl some- 
times have, put an onion, salt and hot water into 
the dripping pan, and baste them for the first ten 
minutes wth this, then take away the pan and 
baste constantly with butter. 

To Roast Partridges, Pheasants or Quails. — 
Pluck, singe, draw and truss them, season -with 
salt and pepper, roast for about" half an hour in a 
brisk oven, basting often with butter. When done 
place on a dish together with bread crumbs fried 
brown and arranged in small heaps. Gravy 
should be served in a tureen apart. 

To Broil Quail or Woodcock. — After dressing, 
split do-wTi the back, sprinkle with salt and pep- 
per, and lay them on a gridiron, the inside down. 
Broil slowly at first. Serve with cream gravy. 

To Roast Wild Duck or Teal. — After dressing, 
soak them over night in salt and water, to draw 
out the fishy taste. Then in the morning put them 
into fresh water, changing several times before 
roasting. Stuff or not, as desired. Serve with 
currant jelly. 

Pigeon Pie. — Dress and wash clean, split down 
the back, and then proceed as for chicken pie. 

Roast Pigeons. — When cleaned and ready for 
roasting, fill the bird with a stuffing of bread 
crumbs, a spoonful of butter, a little salt and nut- 
meg, an(J three oysters to each bird (some prefer 
chopped apple). They must be well basted with 
melted butter, and require thirty minutes' careful 
cooking. In the autumn they are best, and should 
be full grown. 

To Roast Pigeons. — They should be dressed 
while fresh. If young, they will be ready for 
roasting in twelve hours. Dress carefully, and 
after making clean, wipe dry and put into each 
bird a small piece of butter dipped in cayenne. 
Truss the wings over the back and roast in a quick 
oven, keeping them constantly basted with butter. 
Serve with brown gravy. Dish them with young 
water-cresses. 

Fried Rabbit. — After the rabbit has been 
thoroughly cleaned and washed, put it into boiling 
water and let boil for about ten minutes ; drain, 
and when cold, cut it into joints, dip into beaten 
egg, and then into fine bread-crumbs, seasoned 
with salt and pepper. When all are ready fry 
them in butter over a moderate fire fifteen min- 
utes, thicken the gravy with an ounce of butter 
and a small teaspoonful of flour, give it a miiv- 
iite's boil, stir in two tablespoonfuls of cream, 
dish the rabbit, pour the sauce under it, and serve 
quickly. 

Stewed Rabbit. — Skin and clean the rabbit, 
cut into pieces, put one-fourth of a pound of but- 
ter into a stewjian and turn the pieces of rabbit 
about in it until nicely browned ; take out the 
meat, add one pint of boiling water to the butter, 
one tablespoonful of flour stirred to a paste in 
cold water, one tablespoonful of salt, and a little 
grated onion if liked ; let this boil up, add the 
meat, stew slowly till the rabbit is tender. Serye

CHICKEN SALAD—POTATO SALAD. 



SALADS. 



Mayonn vise S.\xai> DkessinCt.— The yolk of one 
egg, raw ; stir into this all the olive oil it will 
hold, in as fine a stream as possible. Season wth 
cayenne pepper, salt and mustard. 

Simple Dressing for Salads. — Mix three table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil and one tablespoonful of 
scraped onion with one saltspoonful of salt and 
one saltspoonful of pepper (mixed), and then add 
one tablespoonful of vinegar. When thoroughly 
mixed, i^our over the salad. 

Chicken Salad Dressing. — Take two hard- 
boiled eggs, lay them into water till quite cold, 
put the yolks into a small bowl and mash them 
very fine, adding the yolks of two raw eggs, one 
teaspoonful o salt, one large tablespoonful of dry 
mustard, a very little cayenne pepper ; stir this 
well, always one way ; when well mixed, add a 
very little sweet oil, stirring all the time. After 
this is mixed, put in more, a very little at a time, 
until you have used a third of a bottle ; then add a 
large spoonful of vinegar or lemon juice ; then 
more oil as before — using in all two-thirds of a 
bottle — then another spoonful of vinegar ; when 
well mixed it must be very light, and a nice 
color. Set ojx the ice for two or three hours. Not 
more than twenty minutes before using the salad, 
mix it and prepare for the table by putting with 
the meat about half the dressing ; stir it up well, 
and then pour on to the meat one mne glass of 
best vinegar ; stir this up well — it will turn the 
chicken very white ; if it requires a little more salt 
add it now. Place the chicken in the center of a 
flat dish, large enough to lay lettuce or celery 
around the meat ; wipe the lettuce as dry as you 
can, and lay around the meat, then with a spoon 
put the rest of the dressing on the lettuce. 

Chicken Salad.— To two large boiled fowls 
(cold) take two large heads of celery or four small 
ones ; having removed all the skin and the fat, cut 
the meat from the bones into very small pieces. 
It is best not to mix the dressing with salad 
until just before it is to be eaten. Put into a por- 
celain kettle the gravy from the chicken, one-half 
pint of vinegar, one-half pint of sweet oil or 
melted butter, one large tablespoonful of Colman's 
mustard, one small teaspoonful of cayenne pep- 
per, one teaspoonful of salt, the yolks of eight 
eggs beaten and stirred in just before taken off, 
one teacup of cream stu-red into the dressing when 
cold ; mix together with a silver fork and garnish 
with celery tops. 

LoiJSTER Salad. — To a three-pound lobster 
take the yolk of one raw egg, beat very lightly ; 
then take the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs 
(cold), and add to the raw yolk, beating all the 
time ; add, gradually, a few drops at a time, one- 
half bottle of the finest olive oil, still stirring all 
the time ; then add one and a half tablc^poonfuls 
of the best English mustard, salt and pepper to 
taste ; beat the mixture until light, add a table- 
spoonful of strong vinegar. Cut the lobster into 
small pieces and mix with it salt and pepper ; pour 
over it the dressing just before sending to the 
table ; garnish with the white of egg (boiled), cel- 
ery tops, and the small claws. 



Lobster Salad. — Pick the meat from the shell, 
chop and season the same as for chicken salad ; 
garnish mth the claws and parsley. 

Lettuce Salad. — Two heads of lettuce, two 
hard-boiled eggs, two teaspoonfuls of butter, one- 
half teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful white 
sugar, one-half teaspoonful of made mustard, one 
teaspoonful pepper, four tablespoonfuls of vine- 
gar ; rub the yolks of the eggs to a powder, add 
sugar, butter, pepper, salt and mustard ; let it 
stand five minutes, then beat in the vinegar. Cut 
the lettuce with a knife and fork, put into a bowl, 
and mix in the dressing by tossing with a fork. 

Lettuce Salads. — Serve with simple dressing, 
and garnish with hard-boiled eggs. 

Lettuce, cold boiled potatoes, and cold boiled 
beets ; potatoes in the center, beets next, and 
lettuce around the edge of the dish. Simple 
dressing. 

Potato Salad. — Potatoes boiled in the" jacket," 
and peeled while warm, cut evenly into fine slices, 
and when cold mixed with fine olive oil. After 
having drawn with this for a little while, add salt, 
pepper, chopped onion, and mix all this by shaking 
it up, as using a spoon would break the potatoes, 
and make them unsightly. Add good vinegar. 

Potato Salad. — Small onions sliced and cold 
boiled potatoes, over which pour the simple dres- 
sing. 

Potato Salad. — Cut a dozen cold boiled pota- 
toes into fancy shapes, one-quarter of an inch 
thick ; mix with some flakes of cold boiled fish 
(halibut, cod or salmon), and pour over them a 
salad dressing, made with six tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, or salad oil, six tablespoonfuls of 
cream or milk, one tablespoonful of salt, half 
that quantity of pepper, and one teaspoonful of 
ground mustard. Into this mix one cupful of vine- 
gar. Boil well, then add three raw eggs, beaten 
to a foam ; remove directly from the fire, and stir 
for five minutes ; when thoroughly cold turn over 
the salad. Garnish with slices of pickled cucum- 
ber, cold beet, hard-boiled egg, and fresh parsley. 

Celery Salad. — One head of cabbage, three 
bunches of celery, chopped very fine. Take one 
teacupful of vinegar, lump of butter size of an 
egg, yolks of two eggs ; one teaspoonful mustard, 
one of salt, pinch of cayenne pepper, two tear 
spoonfuls of sugar. Mix these well ; put the mix- 
ture on the stove and heat until it thickens, stir- 
ring all the time ; when cold, add two tablespoott- 
fuls of rich sweet cream. Pour over the salad ; if 
not moist enough, add cold vinegar. 

Chicken Celery. — Chop the remains of chicken 
or turkey, and mix with an equal proportion of 
celery ; a little salt and vinegar only, although 
some like a dressing as for slaw ; but this takes 
away too much of celery taste. It may be pre- 
pared with lettuce instead of celery. 

Cabbage Salad. — Cut the cabbage very fine, 
and put into a dish in layers, with salt and pepper 
between. Then take two teas{Doonfuls of butter, 
two of sugar, two of flour, two of mustard, one 
cup of vinegar, and one egg. Stir all together, 
and let it come to a boil on the stove. Pour it hot 
over, and mix well with the cabbage ; cover up.

dish suitable for baking ; then a layer of bread- 
crumbs over them, salt, pepper, and plenty of 



butter, another layer of tomatoes, and so on until 
the dish is full. Bake one hour. 

Saveet Potatoes. — Sweet potatoes require more 
time to cook than common potatoes. To Boil —

water, and set them for a few minutes in a tin 
pan before the fire, or in the stove, that they may 
be well dried. Peel them before sent to the table. 
To Fry. — Choose large potatoes, half boil them, 
and then, having taken off the skins, cut the 
potatoes in slices and fry in butter, or in nice 
drippings. To Bake— Bake as the common po- 
tato, except give them a longer time.

a few mashed potatoes, then put them into a col- 
ander, pressing them through into the dish you 
wish to serve them in ; set in the oven and browru 

Potato Puff. — Take two large cups of cold 
mashed potatoes, and stir into it two tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter, beating to a white cream 
before adding anything else ; then put with this 
two eggs, beaten very light, and a teacupful of 
cream or milk, salting to taste. Beat all well, pour 
into a deep dish, and bake in quick oven until 
nicely browned. 

Saratoga Potatoes. — Peel, and slice on a slaw- 
cutter into cold water, wash thoroughly, and 
drain ; spread between the folds of a clean cloth, 
rub and pat until dry. Fry a few at a time in boil- 
ing lard, salt as you take them out. Saratoga 
potatoes are often eaten cold. They can be pre- 
pared three or four hours before needed, and if 
kept in a warm place they will be crisp and nice. 
They are used for garnishing game and steaks. 

Potato Cakes. — Two pounds of mashed pota- 
toes, two tablespoonfuls of butter and a little salt, 
two pounds of flour, and milk enough to make a 
batter, one-half cup of yeast ; set it to rise, and

peel and slice them in slices one-third of an inch 
thick, dip them into dissolved butter, place on a 
gridiron over a very clear fire, grill them until 
nicely brovmed underneath ; then turn them, and

small piece of butter, a little parsley chopped fine, 
salt and pepper, and half a cup of cream, set on 
the fire and let come to a boil. Cut cold boiled 
potatoes into small pieces and turn into the cream, 
let the cream boil up well around the potatoes, 
add another small piece of butter and serve. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes. — Into a sauce-pan put a 
large lump of butter and a small onion, finely 
chopped, and when the onion is fried to an amber 
color, throw in slices of cold boiled potatoes, 
which must be thoroughly stirred until they are 
turning brown ; at this moment put in a .spoonful 
of finely-chopped parsley, and as soon as it is 
cooked drain through a colander, so the potatoes 
retain the moisture of the butter and many par- 
ticles of the parsley. Thus j^ou may have Lyon- 
naise potatoes. 

Fried Oyster Plant. — Parboil oyster plant ; 
scrape off the outside ; cut in slices ; dip in beaten 
egg, roll in bread-crumbs, and fry in hot lard. 

Salsify, or Vegetable Oysters. — Wash and 
scrape them thoroughly, and as you wash throw 
them into a bowl of cold water. Cut into pieces 
about half an inch long, boil three-fourths of an 
hour ; when tender, pour off all the water, sea- 
son with pepper and salt, a small lump of butter, 
and enough of cream to almost cover them ; if no 
cream, use milk, with more butter, and thicken 
like gravy with a little flour. They are nice served 
on toast. 

Baked Egg Plant.— Cut in halves a nice smooth 
egg plant ; scoop out the center, leaving with the 
skin about one-third of an inch ; chop the inside 
of the egg plant very fine, two ripe tomatoes, one 
onion, some bread-crumbs, a little parsley, and 
green pepper — onion and pepper to be chopped 
separately very fine — salt, butter, and very little 
pepper ; mix very smooth, put in the shell, butter 
on top, and bake about one-half hour. 

Fried Egg Plant.— Pare and slice them, then 
sprinkle each slice with salt and let them stand for 
about one hour with a weight on them, then dip 
into egg well beaten, then flour and fry light brown 
in lard and butter. 

To Fry Parsley.— This, when done as it should 
be, is one of the nicest as well as cheapest of gar- 
nishings. The parsley should be washed and 
dried in a cloth ; then if one is tlie happy posses- 
sor of a wire basket, put in the parsley and hold 
from two to three minutes in boiling drippings ; 
take from the basket and dry until cri.sp before the 
kitchen fire. It may be fried without a basket, 
but requires more care in so doing. 

Scotch Escallops.— Peel potatoes and slice, 
not quite as thin as for Saratoga chips, and cover 



the bottom of a dripping pan with them ; sprinkle 
with salt and pepper and small pieces of butter or 
butter and lard mixed ; continue this until the pan 
is full ; lay a slice or two of salt pork on the top ; 
cover closely and bake in a good hot oven. Very 
nice sweet potatoes can be prepared in the same 
way. They are very nice without the pork. 

Turnips. — Pare and cut into pieces ; put them 
into boiling water well salted, and boil until ten- 
der ; drain thoroughly and then mash and add a 
piece of butter, pepper, and salt to taste, and a 
small teaspoonful of sugar. Stir until they are 
thoroughly mixed, and serve hot. 

Fried Parsnips. — Scrape, cut into strips, and 
boil until tender in salted Avater ; drain and dip 
into batter, made with one egg beaten light, one- 
half cup milk, and flour enough to make a batter 
and fry in hot butter or lard. 

Asparagus. — Cook only the tender green stalks ; 
cut them of equal lengths, and boil in water with 
a little salt till tender. While the aspai-agus is 
cooking, prepare some nicely-toasted bread, lay 
the asparagus on the toast, and season with but- 
ter, salt, and pepper, or pour over it a little cream 
previously scalded. 

Spinach. — Spinach requires good washing and 
close picking. Boil twenty minutes in boiling 
water, drain, season with butter, pepper, and salt ; 
garnish the dish with slices of hard-boiled eggs. 

Fresh Corn Mush. — Take several ears of green 
corn, grate it down ; stir some milk into the 
corn briskly with a little salt ; strain through a 
coarse sieve, and put in a hot cooking-pot with a 
spoonful of lard. Keep it well stirred for at least 
twenty minute.?, without stopping while cooking. 
When thickened, put into a deep dish, slice, and 
fry. 

Parsnip Fritters. — Four parsnips, boiled and 
mashed fine ; add three well-beaten eggs, two 
tablespoonfuls of sifted flour, butter the size of an 
egg, one teacup of milk, and salt to taste. Upon 
a hot-buttered griddle drop the mixture, and bake' 
after the style of flannel-cakes. Serve quite hot. 

Parsnip Stew. — Three slices of salt pork, boil 
one hour and a half ; scrape five large parsnips, 
cut in quarters lengthwse, add to the pork and 
let boil, one-half hour, then add a few potatoes, 
and let all boil together until the potatoes are 
soft ; the fluid in the kettle should be about a cup- 
ful when ready to take off. 

Green Peas. — Put the pods into a pot, cover 
and boil thoroughly ; then strain, and put the peas 
into the same water and boil tender. Season >vith 
butter, pepper, a little salt, and the least bit of 
sugar. 

Boiled Hominy. — Soak one cup of fine hominy 
in three cups of water and salt to taste ; in the 
morning turn it into a quart pail ; then put the 
pail into a kettle of boiling water, cover tightly 
and steam one hour ; then add one teacupful of 
sweet milk, and boil fifteen minutes. 

Cauliflower. — Trim off all the outside leaves, 
and put into boiling water well salted ; boil until 
tender, and then serve with a while sauce or witb 
cream. 



EGGS AND OMELETTES. 



21 



HoMrNY Fritters. — Two teacupfuls of cold 
boiled ^>ominy ; stir in one teacupful of sweet 
milk and a little salt, four tablespoonfuls of sifted 
flour and one eg^ ; beat the white separately and 
add last ; drop the batter by spoonfuls into hot 
lard, and fry a nice brown. 

Baked Cabbage. — Cook as for boiled cabbage, 
after which drain and set aside until cold. Chop 
fine, add two beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, pepper, salt, three tablespoonfuls rich cream ; 
stir well and bake in a buttered dish until brown. 
Eat hot. 

Beets. — Wash thoroughly, being careful not to 
prick the skin, as that will destroy the color ; put 
into boiling water, and boil five or six hours ; if 
served hot, season with butter, pepper and salt ; if 
cold, cover with vinegar. 



EGGS AND OMELETTES. 

IIow TO Bake Eggs, etc. — Butter a clean, 
smooth saucepan, break as many eggs as will be 
needed into a saucer, one by one. If found good, 
slip it into the dish. No broken yolk allowed, nor 
must they crowd so as to risk breaking the yolk 
after put in. Put a small piece of butter on each, 
and sprinkle with pepper and salt. Set into a 
well-heated oven, and bake till the whites ai-e set. 
If the oven is rightly heated, it will take but a few 
minutes, and is far more delicate than fified eggs. 

Eggs a la Mode. — Remove the skin from a 
■dozen tomatoes, medium size, cut them up in a 
saucepan, add a little butter, pepper, and salt ; 
when sufficiently boiled, beat up five or six eggs, 
and just before you serve, turn them into the 
saucepan with the tomato, and stir one way for 
two minutes, allowing them time to be well done. 

Egg Baskets. — Boil quite hard as many eggs as 
■will be neec'ed. Put into cold water till cold, 
then cut neatly into halves with a thin, sharp 
knife ; remove the yolk and rub to a paste with 
some melted butter, adding pepper and salt. 
Cover up this paste and set aside till the filling is 
ready. Take cold roast duck, chicken, or turkey 
■which may be on hand, chop fine and pound 
smooth, and while pounding mix in the paste pre- 
pared from the yolks. As you pound moisten with 
melted butter and some gravy which may have 
been left over fi'om the fowls ; set this paste when 
done over hot water till well heated. Cut off a 
small slice from the end of the empty halves of the 
whites, so they will stand Arm, then fill them with 
this paste ; place them close together on a flat 
round dish, and pour over the rest of the gravy, if 
any remains, or make a little fresh. A few spoon- 
fuls of cream or rich milk improves this dressing. 

French Egg Cake.— Beat up thoroughly ?:x 
eggs, a teaspoonful of sweet cream or milk, and 
little salt. Fry in a pan in which there is one-haa 
ounce of melted butter, over a quick Are. In order 
that the omelette may remain soft and juicy, it is 
necessary that the pan should be hot before the 
eggs are poured in. During the frying move the 
pan continually to and fro ; continue this until a 
cake is formed, then let it remain still a moment to 
brown. Turn out and serve immediately. 



Egg Toast. — Beat four eggs, yolks and whites 
together, thoroughly ; put two tablespoonfuls of 
butter into a saucepan and melt slowly ; then 
pour in the eggs and heat, without boiling, over a 
slow fire, stirring constantly ; add a little salt, and 
when hot spread on slices of nicely-browned toast, 
and serve at once. 

Omelette. — Beat the yolks and whites of eight 
eggs separately until light, then beat together ; add 
a little salt and one tablespoonful of cream. Have 
in the omelette pan a piece of butter ; when the 
butter is boiling-hot, pour in the omelette, and 
shake until it begins to stiffen, and then let it 
brown. Fold double and serve hot. 

Apple Omelette. — Eight large apples, four 
eggs, one cup of sugar, one tablespoonful of but- 
ter, nutmeg or cinnamon to taste. Stew the 
apples and mash fine, add butter and sugar ; when 
cold, add the eggs, well beaten. Bake until 
brown, and eat while warm. 

Baked Omelette. — Set one-half pint of milk on 
the fire and stir in one-half cup of flour mixed 
with a little cold milk and salt ; when scalding- 
hot, beat the yolks of six eggs and add them, stir 
in whites and set immediately in the oven ; bake 
twenty minutes, and serve as soon as done. 

Oyster Omelette. — Allow for every six large 
oysters or twelve small ones, one egg ; remove the 
hard part and mince the rest very fine ; take the 
yolks of eight eggs and whites of four, beat till 
very light, then mix in the oysters, season and 
beat all up thoroughly ; put into a skillet a gill of 
butter, let it melt ; when the butter boils, skim it 
and turn in the omelette ; stir until it stiffens,' fry 
light brown ; when the under side is brown, turn 
on to a hot platter. If wanted the upper side 
brown, hold a red-hot shovel over it. 

Omelette Soufflee.— Stir five tablespoonfuls 
of sifted flour into three pints of milk, strain 
through a sieve ; add the yolks of eight eggs, 
beaten very light, and, just as it goes into the 
oven, the whites beaten stiff. Bake quickly. 

French Omelette. — One quart of milk, one 
pint of bread-criimbs, five eggs, one tablespoonful 
of flour, one onion chopped fine, chopped parsley, 
season with pepper and salt. Have butter melted 
in a spider ; when the omelette is brown, turn it 
over. Double when served. 

Omelette with Ham. — Make a plain omelette, 
and just before turning one half over the other, 
sprinkle over it some finely-chopped ham. Gar- 
nish with small slices of ham. Jelly or marmalade 
may be added in the same manner. 

To Poach Eggs.— Have the water well salted, 
and not let it boil hard. Break the eggs separately 
into a saucer, and slip gently into the water ; when 
nicely done, remove with a skimmer, trim neatly, 
and lay each egg upon a small thin square of but- 
tered toast, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Some persons prefer them poached, rather than 
fried, with ham ; in which case substitute the ham 
for toast. 

Sttipfed Eggs. — Boil the eggs hard, remove the 
shells, and then cut in two, either way as preferred. 
Remove the yolks, and mix with them pepper, salt, 
and a little dry mustard — some like cold chicken. 



22 



BREAD, BISCUITS, ETC. 



ham, or tongue chopped very fine — and then stuff 
the cavities, smooth them, and put the halves 
together again. For picnics they can simply be 
\vrapped in tissue paper to keep them together. 
If for home use, they can be egged, and bread- 
crumbed, and browned in boihng lard ; drain and 
garnish ^vith parsley. 

Tomato Omelet. — One quart of tomatoes, chop- 
ped iinely (after the skin is removed), and put into 
a saucepan vrith two finely-chopped onions, a little 
butter, salt and pepper, one cracker pounded fine- 
ly, cover tight, and let it simmer about an hour ; 
beat five eggs to a froth ; have your griddle hot ; 
grease it well ; stir your eggs into the tomato, beat 
together, and pom" into the griddle ; brown on one 
side, fold, and brown on the other. To be served 
hot. 

Bread Omelet. — One cup of bread-crumbs wet 
with a little milk, salt and pepper ; let stand un- 
til soft ; beat eight eggs light, heat the skillet, add- 
ing a large lump of butter, mix the bread and 
eggs, pour into the* skillet, and after eggs harden 
divide in the middle. 



BREAD, BISCUITS, ETC. 

Teast. — Take two good-sized potatoes, grate 
them raw. Add one-half teacup of white sugar, 
one teaspoon of salt, a little ginger. Pour over 
the mixture one-half pint of" boiling water, in 
which one tablespoonful of hops has been boiled. 
Save half a cup each time to start anew. 

Teast. — To one cup of grated raw potato add 
half cup salt and half cup sugar ; pour over all one 
quart boiling water, stirring well ; it will thicken 
like starch ; when nearly cold, add one cup of 
good yeast. In about twelve hours it should be 
light ; put in jug or bottle, and cork tightly. 

Teast. — A double handful of hops, one-half 
dozen large potatoes ; boil together in one-half 
gallon of water till done ; strain and mash on to 
one-half cupful of ginger, small cup of flour, and 
one cup of brown sugar, and half cup of salt. 
Let stand until cool, then add one cupful of good 
yeast. Next day cork up tight in a jug. 

Teast and Bread.— Take ten large potatoes, 
pare and put them in a kettle \\ith three quarts of 
water ; put a pint of hops in a thin nuislin ])ag in 
the same kettle wit" potatoes ; boil until iiotatoes 
are .soft, then pour che water from this kettle boil- 
ing hot over a pi.it of flour in a crock. Squeeze 
all tho strength from the hops ; mash the potatoes, 
add a quart of co.d water to them, and put tlirough 
a colander into tho crock, and add one-half tea- 
cup of salt, a cup of sugar, one tablespoon of gin- 
ger. Let this stand for two days until it stops 
fermenting and settles ; then put into a jug, cork 
tight, and keep in a cool place. 

For the Bread.— Pare and boil six good-sized 
potatoes, drain off the water, mash fine, and pour 
over them about three pints of cold water and run 
through a colander. Add flour uutii this is a thin 
batter, then put in a coffeecup of yeast from the 
jug. Let stand until it rises, then stir into flour as 



much as you can with a spoon, and let rise again. 
Work in enough more flour to make as stilf a» 
bread, and let rise the third time. When light, 
this time work out into loaves, and let rise. All 
the flour must be sifted. 

To Freshen Stale Bread. — Pump on or pour 
water over the loaf until moistened through, put 
in a pan, set in the oven and bake until the moist- 
ure is all absorbed. 

Milk Sponge Bread.— Put a pint of boihng 
water in a pitcher, with a teaspoonful of sugar ; 
one-quarter teaspoonful salt, and the same of soda ; 
let it stand till you can bear your finger in it ; then 
add flour to make a thick batter ; beat it hard for 
two minutes. Now place the pitcher in a kettle of 
hot water — not hot enough to scald, the mixture ; 
keep the water at the same temperature till the 
emptyings are light. If set early in the morning 
they will be ready, if watched carefully, at eleven 
o'clock to make a sponge, the same as for other 
bread, with a quart of very warm milk. Let this 
sponge get very light ; then make into loaves, and 
set to rise again, taking care they do not get too 
light this time before putting in the oven, or the 
bread will be dry and tasteless. 

Salt-Rising Bread. — Take newly-ground mid- 
dlings ; put six heaping teaspoonfuls of it in a 
coffee cup ; add one t-easpoon of sugar, one salt- 
spoon of salt, one-half saltspoon of soda ; mix 
thoroughly ; pour boiling water in the mixture, 
stirring it well together until it will nearly fill the 
cup ; remove the spoon ; cover the cup of dough \ 
set it where it will keep warm, not scald ; set it 
Friday morning, and it will be light for Satui'day's 
baking ; if in a hurry, set in a dish of warm water. 
Now put in bread-pan flour enough for bread ; add 
salt ; take one quart of boiling water for thi'ee 
loaves, and turn into the middle of your flour, 
Stirling in slowly ; put enough cold water (or 
milk) to cool .sufficiently to bear your linger in it ;. 
then add middlings — stir in well ; cover with some 
of the flour, and set in a warm place. When light 
enough, mix soft into loaves ; grease bread-pans ; 
also top of the loaves, which makes tender upper 
crust ; cut gashes quite deep across the loaves, and 
it will rise evenly ; set near the stove, and when 
light enough, bake thi-ee-quarters of an hour. 

Salt-Rising Bread. — In the morning take a 
quart dish and scald it out ; then put in a pint of 
warm water ; put in a teaspoonful of salt ; stir 
flour enough in to make a thick batter ; set the 
dish in a kettle of warm water, and where it will 
keep of the same temperature — just warm enough 
to bear your hand in. If the flour is good it will 
be at the top of the dish in two hours ; then take 
flour enough in a pan to make three loaves of 
bread ; make a hole in the middle ; put in the 
yeast, and the same dish full of warm water ; stir 
it up thick with a spoon, and cover it with some 
of the flour, and set it to rise. When light, mold 
it into loaves, and set it in a warm place to rise 
again. When light enough, bake three-quarters 
of an hour. 

Baking-Powder Biscuit. — One important point 
is in having a hot oven ; another is, have flour 
sifted, and roll dough as soft as you can handle ; 
then more baking powder is needed. For each 
teacup of flour take a teaspoon of powder ; butter. 



BREAD, BISCUITS, ETC. 



23 



the size of a small hen's eggs, Is sufficient for a 
quart of flour. After rubbing butter and powder 
Into the amount of flour needed, turn in cold 
water (milk will do), stirring all the time, till 
the right consistency is reached ; salt ; then roll 
lightly, and bake at once. They will prove flakey, 
feathery, delicious and more nutricious than bis- 
cuit raised with yeast. 

Soda Biscuits.— Three pints of flour, a table- 
spoon of butter and a tablespoon of lard, a tea- 
spoon of salt and a teaspoon even full of cream of

stir, but put them together at night, and set in a 
cool place until morning. Then mix all together 
and knead fifteen minutes. Set in a cool place 
again for six hours, and roll out about one-half an 
inch thick and cut with a tiiscuit cutter. Moisten 
one edge with butter, and fold together like rolls. 
Lay in the pan so that they will not touch, set for 
half an hour in a warm place to rise, and bake in 
a quick oven. 

Light Biscuit. — Take about as much dough, 
after it is light, as would make a good-sized loaf 
of bread ; put it in a pie-pan ; mix in a small 
cup of lard and butter (more lard than butter), one 
tablespoon of flne sugar ; do not put in any more 
flour ; never mind if sticky ; then let rise very light, 
keeping in warm place ; roll out about one-half 
'nch thick without moulding. Bake in rather quick 
0\ ^n. Will bake in fifteen or twenty minutes. 

LiCt.^t Bj, cuit. — In kneading bread set aside a 
small I\i,f for biscuits. Into this work a heaping 
tablespoV nful of lard and butter mixed, and a tea- 
spoon of Vig-ar. The more it is worked the whiter 
it will be. \ As it rises, mold it down twice before 
making vaXk biscuit. Roll out and cut with a bis- 
cuit-cutter. \ The dough should be quite soft. 

French RAlls. — One pint of milk come to a 
boil, one-half \up of butter, one cup of sugar, one 
cup of yeast, 1 tirred into a sponge ; when light

soft with warm milk and one-half cup of yeast ; 
mix in the morning and set to rise until noon ; 
then break into it two eggs, three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, and tea-. 
spoonful of salt ; mix up well together with hands, 
and set to rise again until about an hour before 
tea. Then knead a little, and cutting off a piece 
about the size of a common biscuit, roll out to 
about the size of a saucer, spread thinly with but- 
ler and turn over. After they are molded let them 
stand until light enough, and bake in a very quick 
oven. 



English Rolls. — Two pounds of flour, two 
ounces of butter, three tablespoonfuls of yeast, 
one pint of warm milk ; mix well together, and set

one large spoonful white sugar, one teaspoonful 
salt, one penny-worth of yeast, and flour to make 
a stiff batter. Leave it in a moderately-warm 
place. In the morning add flour enough to make 
a soft dough, working it well. Let it rise again, 
roll out half an inch thick, cut into round cakes, 
fold together, drawing a buttered knife through 
as you fold them. Let them rise again for half 
an hour, or till light ; bake in a quick oven from 
fifteen to twenty minutes. In cold weather the 
milk should be luke-warm ; in hot weather the 
milk should be scalded and cooled. The potatoes 
must be pared before boiling, and the kettle in 
which they are boiled must«be perfectly clean. 

Rusks. — In one large coffeecup of warm milk 
dissolve one cake of compressed yeast, then add 
three eggs and one cup of sugar, and beat all 
together ; use only flour enough to roll out, to 
which add two ounces of butter ; let it raise.

bowl three ounces of sugar with three yolks of 
eggs, then turn the milk into the bowl little by lit- 
tle, stirring and mixing the while, and pour over 
the cake and fruits in the mold. The mixture 
must be poured over in sprinkling, and it must 
nearly cover the whole, or within half an inch. It 
must not be poured over slowly, for, as the cake 
absorbs the liquor pretty fast, you would have too 
much of it. Place the mold in a pan of cold 
water so that the mold is about one-third covered 
by it ; set on the fire, and as soon as it boils place 
the whole (pan and mold) in an oven at about 380 
degrees Fahrenheit, and bake. It takes one hour 
to bake. When done, place a dish over the mold>.

PIES. 



In making good pastry it is necessary to have 
the butter sweet, the lard fresh ; the flour should 
be of the best quality, and sifted ; the water for 
wetting as cold as possible — ice water preferable. 
In rolling the crust, roll always one way, and bake 
in a quick oven. 

Puff Paste. — One pound of flour, one pound of 
butter, one egg ; mix the flour with a lump of 
butter the size of an egg, and the egg to a very 
stiff paste with cold water ; divide the butter into 
six equal parts, roll the paste, and spread on one 
part of the butter, dredging it with flour. Repeat 
until all the butter is rolled in. 

Pastry. — To one cup of water take one-half cup 
of lard, a little salt and some flour ; mix together 
with a knife. When stiff enough roll out on a 
board, spread on with a knife a layer of lard, and

CAKES. 



Use the best of materials for cake. The pulver- 
ized sugar should always be sifted. Sift the tiour. 
Beat the whites and yolks of eggs separately. 
When fruit is used, sprinkle with flour. Stir but- 
ter and sugar to a cream. If baking-powder is 
used, sift it well through the flour. While the 
cake is baking, no air must be permitted to get 
into the oven, unless when neoessary to look at 
the cake, as it is apt to make it fall. The heat of 
the oven should be even and regular. When cake 
is done, it can be tested by sticking a clean straw 
into it. If nothing adheres to the straw, the cake 
is done. 

Soft Frosting. — Ten teaspoonfuls of fine sugar 
to one egg : beat one-half hour. 

SuTTi Frutti Frosting. — One-half teacupful

small half teacup of large white raisins, and a lit- 
tle citron, sliced thin. Very nice for sponge cake.

of a cup of water ; boil together until it candies ; 
then add the whites of three eggs, slightly beaten,

and cleave off the spider like a pancake. Cool 
this lump and add four eggs. Beat well, and then 
drop on a butterecl tin in neat, compact little 
" dabs," far enough apart not to touch when they 
rise, llave the oven about as hot as for cookies, 
and in turning them lift up the tin. If you shove 
them before they are set you will have pan-cakes. 
They should be hollow balls. Bake them long 
enough so they will not fall when removed, and 
cool them on brown paper as quickly as possible, 
so they won't sweat. To fill them take one-half 
pint milk, two beaten eggs, one-quarter cup of 
flour or corn starch wet smoothly, one cup sugar, 
lemon or vanilla flavor ; cook it in a tin pail in a 
kettle of hot water, and stir it so it will be 
smooth. When both are cold, open the puff with 
a sharp knife — just a little slit on the side — and 
fill in one tablespoonful of custard.

TEA, COFFEE— FRESH FRUITS. 



Beat the eggs on a large platter very stiff, then 
add the sugar aud flour very lightly. This fills a 
three-quart pau, which must have a tube in it. 
I3ake thirty-five or forty minutes in a moderate 
■oven, then try mth a broom straw. When done, 
remove from the oven, and let stand on the tube 
to cool. Success depends upon having the eggs 
very stiff, and adding the sugar and flour lightly. 

Strawberry Short-Cake. — First prepare the 
berries by picliing ; after they have been well 
"washed — the best way to wash them is to hold the 
boxes under the faucet and let a gentle stream of 
water run over them into an earthen bowl — then 
drain and pick them into an earthen bowl ; now 
take the potato-masher and bruise them and cover 
?vith a thick layer of white sugar ; now set them 
'.side until the cake is made. Take a quart of 
sifted flour, one-half a cup of sweet butter, one 
egg well beaten, three teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder, and milk enougli to make a ratlier stiif 
dough ; knead well, and roll with the roliing-pin 
till about one inch thick ; bake till a nice brown, 
and when done remove it to the table, turn it out 
of the pan, and with a light sharp knife cut it 
down lengthwise and crossways ; now run the 
knife through it, and lay it open for a few mo- 
ments, just to let the steam escape (th-e steam 
ruins the color of the berries) ; then set the bot- 
tom crust on the platter, cover quickly with the 
berries, an inch and a half deep ; lay the top crust 
on the fruit, dust thickly with powdered sugar, 
and if any berry juice is left in the bowl, pour it 
round the cake, not over it, and you will have a 
delicious short-cake.

ing water, but do not boil the tea, and use while 
fresh. Tea is best made in an earthen tea pot — 
never in tin. Iced tea should l)c made several 
hours before it is needed, and then set upon ice. 
Wlien ready to use it, sweeten and drink without 
milk or cream. Use cracked ice to put into the 
glass. 

Vienna Coffee. — Leach or filter the coffee

white of an egg to a froth, then add to the egg 
tliree tablespoonfuls of cold milk ; mix the egg

then pour the proper quantity of water through 
the bag into the pot ; let the water be boiling 
when poured in ; then set the pot back Where it 
can simmer gently fifteen minutes, and you have 
good coffee, without egg-shells or cold water to 
settle it. Coffee that needs settling is not pi'opep- 
ly made. The flannel bag should be made of flan- 
nel so fine that the coffee will not sift through.

minutes, adding one-fourth of a cup of sugar, and 
stirring occasionally.

boil it in half a cup of water. Stir to a smooth 
paste. Sweeten a pint of milk with loaf sugar, 
and, when boiling, pour on to the chocolate and 
let boil together a few seconds, stirring it well. 
Serve immediately. Some persons prefer a little 
water instead of all milk. Sweeten a little cream 
and whip to a froth and place on the top of each 
cup.

then strain through a fine sieve and sweeten with 



powdered sugar ; flavor and pour into a mold and 
set in a cool place. When quite firm turn out in 
a dish. Eat with sugar and cream. 

Chicken Jelly. — Cut up a chicken and put into 
a quart of cold water ; let it simmer until reduced 
to a little less than a pint ; remove from the tire, 
and strain as for jelly ; season with a little salt. 
Chop the breast meat into small pieces and mix 
with liquor, and then pour the whole into a mold 
and set away to cool. 



CANDIES. 



Cocoa-Nut Candy. — Grate very fine a sound 
cocoa-nut, spread it on a dish, and let it dry 
natm'ally for three days, as it will not bear the 
heat of an oven, and is too oily for use when 
freshly broken. Four ounces will be sufiicient 
for a pound of sugar for most tastes, but more 
can be used at pleasure. To one pound of sugar, 
take one-half pint of water, a very little white of 
egg, and then pour over the sugar ; let it stand 
for a short time, then place over a very clear fire, 
and let it boil for a few minutes ; then set it one 
side until the scum is subsided, clear it off, and 
boil the sugar until very thick ; then strew in the 
nut, stir and mix it well, and do not quit for an 
instant until it is finished. The pan should not 
be placed on the fire, but over it, as the nut is lia- 
ble to tam"n with too fierce a heat. 

Almond Candy. — Proceed in the same way as 
for cocoa-nut candy. Let the almonds be per- 
fectly dry, and do not throw them into the sugar 
until they approach the candying point. 

To Candy Nuts. — Three cups of sugar, one cup 
of water ; boil until it hardens when dropped in 
water, then flavor with lemon. It must not bofl 
after the lemon is put in. Put a nut on the end 
of a fine knitting-needle, take out and turn on the 
needle until it is cool. If the candy gets coid, set 
on the stove for a few minutes. Malaga grapes 
and oranges, quartered, maj^ be candied in the 
same way. 

Chocolate Caramels. — Two cups of sugar, one 
cup of warm water, one-half cup of grated choco- 
late, three-fourths of a cup of butter. Let boil, 
without stii'ring, until it snaps in water. 

Chocolate Caramels. — One-half pound of 
grated chocolate, two teacups of sugar, one-half 
cup of milk and water, a lump of butter, one tea- 
spoon of alum. 

Sugar Candy*. — Six cups of white sugar, one 
cup of vinegar, one cup of water, a tablespoonful 
of butter in at the last, with one teaspoonful of 
soda dissolved in hot water. Boil without stir- 
ring one-half hour. Flavor to suit the taste. 

Cream Candy. — Four cups of sugar, two cups 
of water, three-fourths of a cup of vinegar, one 
cup of cream or rich milk, a piece of butter the 
size of an egg, two teaspoonfuls of vanilla, a 
pinch of soda. Let it boil until it cracks in water, 
then work very white. 

Maple Candy. — Four cups of maple sirup ; boil 
until it cracks in water, and just befora taking

burning pain from the mouth down to the 
stomach. Remedies : Magnesia, soda, pearl ash, 
•or soap dissolved in water ; then use stomach- 
pump, or emetic. 

AxKALi. — Best remedy is vinegar. 

Ammonia. — Remedy : Lemon juice, or vinegar. 

Alcohol. — First cleanse out the stomach by an 
emetic, then dash cold water ou the head, and 
give ammonia (spirits of hartshorn). 

Arsenic. — Remedies : In the first place, evacu- 
ate the stomach, then give the white of eggs, lime 
water, or chSlk and water, charcoal, and the 
preparation of u-ou, particularly hydrate. 

Laudanum. — Same as opium. 

Belladonna. — Give emetics, and then plenty of 
vinegar and water, or lemonade. 
Morphine. — Same as opium.

Nitrate of Silver (Lunar Caustic).— Give a 
strong solution of common salt and then emetics.

and water, then strong coffee and acid drinks ; 
dash cold water on the head.

salts). — Remedies : Chalk, magnesia, or soap and 
water, and other soothing drinks. 

Prussic Acid. — When there is time, administer 
chlorine in the shape of soda and lime. ' Hot 
brandy and water ; hartshorn and turpentine are 
also useful. 



Snake Bite, etc. — Apply immediately strong 
hartshorn, and take it internally ; also give sweet 
oil and stimulants freely ; apply a ligature tightly 
over the part bitten, and then apply a cupping- 
glass. 

Tartar Emetic. — Take large doses of tea made 
of galls, Peruvian bark, or white-oak bark.

MISCELLANEOUS. 

To Clean Paint. — Tea leaves may be saved 
from the table for a few days, and when sufficient 
are collected, steep (not boil) them for half an 
hour in a tin pan. Strain the water off through a 
sieve, and use this tea to wash all varnished paint. 
It removes spots, and gives a fresher, newer 
appearance than when soap and water is used. 
For white paint, take up a small quantity of 
whiting on a damp piece of old white flannel, and 
rub over the surface lightly, and it wiU leave the 
paint remai'kably bright and new. 

To Raise the Pile op Velvet. — Cover a hot 
smoothing-iron with a wet cloth, hold the velvet 
firmly over it ; the vapor rising will raise the pile 
of the velvet with the assistance of a light whisk. 

To take Mildew from Linen. — Rub the spots 
with soap ; scrape chalk over it and rub it well ; 
lay it on the grass, in the sun ; as it dries, wet it a 
little ; it will come out with two applications. 

To Clean Marble. — Take two parts of com- 
mon soda, one part of pumice stone, and one part 
of finely-powdered chalk ; sift it through a fine 
sieve, and mix it with water ; then rub it well all 
over the marble, and the stains will be removed ; 
rub the marble over mth salt and water. 

To Clean Tinware. — The best thing for clean- 
ing tinware is common soda. Dampen a cloth, 
dip it in soda, rub the ware briskly, after which, 
wipe di-y. 

To Clean Cut-Glass. — Having washed cut- 
glass articles, let them dry, and afterwards rub 
them with prepared chalk and a soft brush, care- 
fully going into all the cavities. 

Indelible Ink. — To one tablespoonful of rain 
water, one-half teaspoon of vinegar, and a piece 
of lunar caustic, three inches long ; shake well 
together ; put on to your cloth a little milk and 
soda (to a tablespoon of milk, a piece of baking 
soda as large as a grain of corn) ; ii'on smooth, 
and write immediately.

mixed with a little lemon juice ; put in the sun ; 
if necessary use two applications.
