BOSTON FISH MARKET 
CORPORATION 

TESSEES of New Commonwealth Wharf in South 
J—' Boston, a cut of which will be found on cover, 
built especially and to be used exclusively for the 
fresh fish business. Made entirely of cement, brick and 
glazed tile, thoroughly hygienic, in keeping with require- 
ments of Board of Health, and fireproof. 

Provides dock berths for forty vessels and can unload 
from eighty Vessels at same time. Contains an Adminis- 
tration Building and Cold Storage and Power Plant, and 
two long buildings containing forty-four fish stores. The 
entire property comprises 537,100 square feet. 

Spur tracks on our property will make railroad facilities 
ample to all parts of the country. 

Governor Draper, realizing the value of the industry to 
his State, was principal factor in getting the lease. 

The property is the best appointed, and second in size 
only to Grimsby, England, of any fish market in the world.

NEW ENGLAND FISH EXCHANGE 

FORMED September, 1908, to maintain a room for 
the purchase and sale of fish, guaranteeing the consum- 
mation of all sales and purchases registered with it, serving 
both dealers and captains of vessels. Through its various 
channels it aims to better all conditions of the industry. 
Acts as clearing agency for all dealers and matters in 
general pertaining to the business. 

We will be glad to co-operate with the Health Board 
of any section to prevent the sale of bad fish. 

W. K. BEARDSLEY, Manager.

WHOLESALE FISH DEALERS' 
CREDIT ASSOCIATION 

OWING to the magnitude of the business as represented 
from a financial standpoint, the large and varied 
territory over which it expands, it became imperative to 
safeguard as far as possible the individual and collective 
interests of all the dealers and to that end the "Wholesale 
Fish Dealers* Credit Association" (two departments. Credit 
and Collection) was formed. 

Its additional purpose also is to protect the honest re- 
tailer, so far as lies in its power, against the competition 
of the unscrupulous and designing who do not pay their 
honest obligations. 

It is advisable, when seeking credit, to file with the 
association a statement on blanks provided for this purpose. 
These statements are affirmed or denied by our Corre- 
spondents who represent the association in all parts of this 
country and Canada. Such references qualify or deny the 
seeker to an open account. 

Delinquents or "slow pay'* are put on a cash basis. 

Unscrupulous retailers or those who by design or sharp 
practice do not meet their honest obligations, arrangements 
are perfected for their prosecution. The compiled records, 
both credit and undesirables, are open to the inspection of 
all the dealers, hence it behooves any and all retailers to 
observe the one golden maxim, /. e., "Honesty is the Best 
Policy.** 

While yet in its infancy, the association has demon- 
strated its worth, proven a valuable adjunct to our line, and 
has received many flattering testimonials from different 
business sections oi the country. 

B. A. DOHERTY, Manager.

THE OLD TYPE OF FISHING SCHOONER 



/ 




THE NEW TYPE OF FISHING SCHOONER 



FISH AS FOOD. 



INTRODUCTION. 

VALUE AND USE OF FISH. 

As ordinarily used, the term fish includes, besides the fish 
proper, many other water animals, as oysters, clams, and other 
mollusks ; lobsters, crawfish, crabs, and shrimps, and turtle 
and terrapin. The term " sea food '' is often used to cover 
the whole group, or, more particularly, salt-water food prod- 
ucts as distinguished from those of fresh water. 

Fish in one form or another is almost universally recognized 
as an important food material, and enters to some extent into 
the diet of very many if not the majority of American 
families. Few, however, have any adequate conception of the 
great importance of the fisheries of the United States and of 
the immense amount of nutritive material which is every year 
taken from the salt and fresh waters of this country. 

From recent data collected by the United States Fish Com- 
mission it appears that more than 528,000,000 pounds of fish, 
crustaceans, etc., are annually taken from the waters of the 
New England States; over 819,000,000 pounds from the 
Middle Atlantic States; over 106,000,000 from the South 
Atlantic States; 113,000,000 from the Gulf States; 217,000,000 
from the Pacific coast ; 96,000,000 from the Mississippi Kiver 
and its tributaries, and 166,000,000 pounds from Alaska. 
The products of the fisheries of the Great Lakes exceed 
113,000,000 pounds annually, and of the minor interior waters 
5,000,000 pounds. In addition, thousands of pounds of fish 
are annually caught by sportsmen, but statistics of the amount 
are not available. In the case of the coast sections the statis- 
tics given above include only the coast fisheries. The interior 
fisheries of Vermont are included with those of New England, 
the fisheries of New York and Pennsylvania on the Great 
Lakes with those of the Middle Atlantic States, and the fish- 

(1) 



2 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

eries of the east coast of Florida with those of the Gulf States. 
The data for the Great Lakes embrace only those States not 
having coast fisheries, but include the fisheries of the Ohio 
River for Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The figures for the 
interior States are confined to States not having coast or Great 
Lake fisheries. In all sections the data represent the products 
as they leave the hands of the fishermen, except that in the 
case of Alaska the figures include salmon after being canned 
or otherwise prepared for the market. In considering such 
products as clams, scallops, and oysters the weight of the 
edible portion only has been taken into account. 

The total weight of the fish products of the United States 
as they leave the hands of the fishermen is about 2,169,000,000 
pounds, representing in round numbers as the value of the 
catch ^58,000,000. By the processes of canning, salting, 
smoking, and otherwise preserving, the value of the fish is 
very much increased. 

Of the very large quantity of fish annually placed on the 
American market, the greater part is consumed at home, 
although a portion is prepared in various ways for export. 

The preference for fresh-water or salt-water fish is a matter 
of individual taste. Both are, so far as known, equally whole- 
some. Indeed, it may be said that in general the preference 
for one kind of sea food or another is quite largely a matter of 
circumstances. It is noticeable that many kinds of fish which 
are known to be good for food are seldom eaten. Among 
others may be mentioned the whiting, or silver hake, and the 
sea robin. The latter are taken in enormous quantities in 
certain regions. This prejudice against certain fish is largely 
local ; for instance, skates are eaten on the western coast of 
the United States, but until recently they were regarded as of 
no value in the East. A few years ago sturgeon and eel were 
not generally eaten. To-day sturgeon is much prized, and in 
regions where it was formerly worthless commands a high 
price. Many persons have a prejudice against frogs' legs, 
while others consider them a great delicacy. In the United 
States they are now very commonly eaten, and frog raising for 
the market is more or less of an industry. It is doubtful if 
Americans ever eat any portion except the legs of frogs, yet in 
many regions of Europe the bodies are also used. In Cuba 
and other localities squid tentacles are eaten, and are undoubt- 
edly palatable when well prepared. An interesting change of 
opinion regarding the nse of a sea product may be noted in 



FISH AS FOOD. 3 

the case of abalone, a large mollusk abundant on the California 
coast, which was formerly disregarded as a food product by 
Americans, but which, it is said, owing to its use by the 
Chinese^ has become known and is relished. 



CONDITIONS WHICH AFFECT THE MARKET VALUE 

OF FISH. 

The market value of fish is affected by various conditions. 
Among these are the locality from which they come, the 
season in which they are taken, and the food on which they 
have grown. In general, it may be said that fish from clear, 
cold, or deep water are regarded as preferable to those from 
shallow or warm water, while fish taken in waters with a rocky 
or sandy bottom are preferable to those from water with a 
muddy bottom. Some fish, for instance shad, are at their best 
during the spawning season, while others should not be eaten 
during this period. Those fish which feed on small Crustacea 
and the other forms of animal and vegetable life, constituting 
their natural food, are preferable to those living upon sewage 
and other matter which may contaminate the waters. 

The mode of capture also affects the market value. Fish 
caught by the gills and allowed to die in the water by slow 
degrees, as is the case where gill nets are used, undergo 
decomposition very readily and are inferior for food. Fish 
are often landed alive and allowed to die slowly. This cus- 
tom is not only inhumane, but lessens the value of the fish. 
It has been found that fish killed immediately after catching 
remain firm and bear shipment better than those allowed to 
die slowly. The quality of the fish is often injured by 
improper handling in the fishing boats before placing on the 
market. Improvements in transportation facilities and in 
other lines have made it possible to bring fish to market from 
distant fishing grounds in good condition. 

Fresh-water and salt-water fish alike are offered for sale as 
taken from the water, and preserved in a number of ways. 
In some cases preservation is only to insure transportation to 
remote points in good condition. Low temperature is the 
means most commonly employed for this purpose. By taking 
advantage of the recent improvements in apparatus and 
methods of chilling and freezing, fish may be shipped long 
distances and kept a long time in good condition. 



4 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

The preservation of meat or fish by methods of cold storage 
has developed very greatly within recent years and has grown 
to be a very important industry. The process depends for its 
success quite largely upon the fact that the activity of micro- 
organisms, which cause putrefactive and other changes in food 
products, is lessened by cold. In addition to microorganisms, 
which are almost inevitably present, being found everywhere 
— in the air, in water, etc. — fish, like other meats, normally 
contain ferments which cause changes in composition and 
flavor comparable in some ways with those caused by micro- 
organisms, though they differ in important respects. From 
recent investigations along these lines, the conclusion was 
reached that when meat is stored at the freezing point of 
water (32° F.) the activity of microorganisms is checked, but 
the action of ferments normally present in the meat still con- 
tinues, and it ripens, though it does not decay. Such stored 
meat was regarded as especially suited for roasting or broiling, 
though not as good as fresh meat for boiling. On the other 
hand the conclusion was reached that fish cannot be satis- 
factorily preserved at 32° F., since this temperature is not 
sufficient to hinder the action of the ferments present in the 
fish flesh, though it checks the action of microorganisms. 
The ferments acting upon the tissues in which they occur pro- 
duce bodies of unpleasant flavor and the fish becomes unpalat- 
able, though it is not in any sense decayed. To successfully 
hinder the action of the ferments a temperature lower than 
32° F. is needed. These facts are in accord with the common 
practice of shipping fish frozen. 

It is stated on good authority that in commercial practice 
25° F. is regarded as the proper temperature for storing fish 
which has been previously frozen. For dried fish the proper 
temperature is 25° F., for fresh fish 25 to 30° F., for oysters 
33 to 40° F., for oysters in the shell 40° F., and for oysters in 
the tub 35° F. Oysters should not be frozen. It is claimed 
that oysters may be safely kept for six weeks at a temperature 
of 40° F., and an instance is recorded in which they were kept 
ten weeks at this temperature for experimental purposes. 

According to the practice of a successful firm dealing in 
frozen fish, the fish as they are unloaded from the boats are 
sorted and graded as to size and quality, then placed in gal- 
vanized iron pans about 2 feet long, covered with loosely fitting 
lids, and frozen by keeping them twenty-four hours at a 
temperature often as low as 16° below zero. The fish are

removed from the pans in a solid cake and packed in tiers in 
the storehouse and marketed frozen. It is said that thej may 
be thus preserved indefinitely, though as a rule frozen fish are 
only kept six to eight months, being frozen in the spring, 
when the supply is abundant, and sold in the winter or when- 
ever fresh fish cannot be readily obtained. Such frozen fish 
are commonly shipped in barrels packed with broken ice in 
such a manner that the water formed by the melting ice may 
readily escape. 

The flavor of oysters is affected more or less by the locality 
in which they have grown, those from certain regions being 
regarded as of very superior quality. The season of the year 
affects the market value of oysters, although it is noticeable 
that as methods of transportation and jjreservation improve, 
the oyster season becomes longer. This may also be said of 
lobsters, crabs, etc. Extended investigations, including the 
conditions affecting the growth and food value of oysters, 
their parasites and diseases, etc., have been carried on by the 
New Jersey Experiment Stations. These investigations have 
shown that oysters rapidly deteriorate when removed from the 
water, through the fermentative action of bacteria ; and that 
oysters in spawn deteriorate more rapidly than at any other 
season at the same temperature. However, oysters which are 
ready to spawn are considered especially palatable if cooked 
soon after removal from the sea bed. 



PREPARING FISH FOR MARKET. 

Eish are sold either " round," ^.e., whole, or dressed. Some- 
times only the entrails are removed. Often, however, espe- 
cially when dressed for cooking, the head, fins, and, less 
frequently, the bones are removed. This entails a consider- 
able loss in weight as well as of nutritive material. It has 
been assumed that in dressing fish the following percentages 
are lost: Large-mouthed black bass, sea bass, cisco, kingfish, 
mullet, white perch, pickerel, pike, tomcod, weakfish, and 
whitefish, each 17.5 per cent ; small-mouthed black bass, eel, 
Spanish mackerel, porgy, and turbot, each 13.5 per cent ; 
butter-fish, 12.5 per cent ; shad, 11 per cent ; and brook trout, 
16.5 per cent. More recent figures for loss in weight in dress- 
ing are as follows : Bullhead, 50 per cent ; buffalo-fish and 
lake sturgeon, 40 per cent ; carp and sucker, 35 per cent ; 



6 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD, 

fresh-water sheepshead, 23 per cent ; grass pike, black bass, 
white bass, yellow perch, and salmon, 15 per cent, and eels, 
10 i)er cent. 

Large quantities of fish are dried, salted, and smoked, the 
processes being employed alone or in combination. These 
methods insure preservation, but at the same time modify the 
flavor. Several fish products are also prepared by one or more 
of these processes. Caviar, which may be cited as an example, 
is usually prepared from sturgeon roe by salting. The 
methods of salting and packing vary somewhat and give rise 
to a number of varieties. Although formerly prepared almost 
exclusively in Russia, caviar is now made to a large extent in 
the United States. In methods of drying fish the Chinese 
are very expert, producing, among other goods, dried oysters, 
which are said to be palatable and of good quality. Dried 
fish and fish products are also important in the diet of the 
Japanese. 

When fish are salted and cured there is a considerable loss 
in weight, due to removal of the entrails, drying, etc. Cod- 
fish lose 60 per cent in preparation for market. If the 
market-dried fish is boned there is a further loss of 20 per 
cent. The loss in 'weight of pollock from the round to the 
market-dried fish is 60 per cent; haddock, 62 per cent; hake, 
56 per cent ; and cusk, 51 per cent. 

The Scandinavians make a number of fish products in 
which the fish is allowed to ferment, the methods followed 
being in a way comparable with those employed in the manu- 
facture of sauerkraut. In Java the natives are very par- 
tial to fish which has undergone fermentation, sometimes 
apparently putrefactive and resulting in a product which 
would be considered entirely unfit for food from a western 
standpoint. 

The canning industry has been enormously developed in 
recent years and thousands of pounds of fish, oysters, lob- 
sters, etc., are annually preserved in this way. In canning, 
the fish or other material is heated (the air being sometimes 
exhausted also) to destroy microorganisms, and sealed to 
prevent access of air, which would introduce microorganisms 
as well as oxj^gen. Thus the canned material is preserved 
from oxidation and decomposition. The processes of canning 
have been much improved, so that the original flavor is largely 
retained, while the goods may be kept for an indefinite period. 
Fish, as well as meat, is usually canned in its own juice or 



FISH AS FOOD. 7 

cooked in some form, though sardines and some otlier fishes 
are commonly preserved in oil. 

Various kinds of fish extract, clam juice, etc., are offered 
for sale. These are similar in form to meat extract. There 
are also a number of fish pastes and similar products — 
anchovy paste, for instance — which are used as relishes or 
condiments. 

Preservatives such as salicylate of soda are employed to 
some extent in marketing fish and especially oysters. The 
extended use of such materials is not desirable since some of 
them are justly regarded as harmful. 

Oysters and other shellfish are placed on the market alive 
in the shell or are removed from the shell and kept in good 
condition by chilling or other means. Oysters in the shell are 
usually transported in barrels or sacks. Shipment is made to 
far inland points in refrigerator cars and to Europe in the 
cold-storage chambers of vessels. Large quantities of shell- 
fish are also canned. Oysters are often sold as they are taken 
from the salt water. However, the practice of " freshening," 
" fattening," or " floating " is very widespread — that is, 
oysters are placed in fresh or brackish water for a short 
period. They become plump in appearance and have a differ- 
ent flavor from those taken directly from salt water. As 
noted, care should be taken that the oysters are grown and 
fattened in water which is not contaminated by sewage. 

Lobsters, crabs, and other Crustacea are usually sold alive. 
Sometimes they are boiled before they are placed on the market. 
Large quantities of lobsters, shrimps, and crabs are canned. 

Turtle and terrapin are usually marketed alive. Turtle 
soup, however, is canned in large quantities. Frogs are 
marketed alive or dressed, and may be eaten at all seasons, 
but are in the best condition in the fall or winter. It is said 
that Minnesota is the center of the frog industry in the 
United States, the catch for a year being about 5,000^000 
frogs, or not far from 500,000 dozen pairs of frogs' legs, the 
annual value of the frog business being upward of $100,000. 

NUTRITIVE VALUE OF FISH. 

COMPOSITION OF FISH. 

Fish contain the same kinds of nutrients as other food 
materials. In general it may be said that food (fish, meat, 
cereals, vegetables, etc.) serves a two-fold purpose : It sup-

plies the body with material for building and repairing its 
tissues and fluids, and furnishes it with fuel for maintaining 
body temperature and for supplying the energy necessary for 
muscular work. 

In a way the body is like a machine, with food for its source 
of motive power. The body differs from a machine, however, 
in that the fuel, i.e., food, is used to build it as well as supply 
it with energy. Further, if the body is supplied with more 
food than is needed, the excess can be stored as reserve 
material, usually in the form of fat. In the furnace, fuel is 
burned quickly, yielding heat and certain chemical products — 
carbon dioxid, water vapor, and nitrogen. In the body the 
combustion takes place much more slowly, but in general the 
final products are the same. The combustion of nitrogen is, 
however, not so complete as in a furnace. Due allowance is 
made for this fact in calculations involving the question of the 
energy which food will furnish. 

Eood consists of an edible portion and refuse, i.e., bones of 
fish and meat, shells of oysters, bran of wheat, etc. Although 
foods are so different in appearance, chemical analysis shows 
that they are all made up of a comparatively small number of 
chemical compounds. These are water and the so-called 
nutrients, protein or nitrogenous materials, fat, carbohydrates, 
and ash or mineral matter. Familiar examples of protein are 
lean of fish and meat, white of Qg^, casein of milk (and cheese), 
and gluten of wheat. Fat is found in fat fish and meat, in 
lard, fat of milk (butter), and oils, such as olive oil. Starches, 
sugars, and woody fiber or cellulose form the bulk of the car- 
bohydrates. Certain carbohydrates are found in meat and 
fish, although the amount is not large. The protein, fats, and 
carbohydrates are all organic substances — that is, they can be 
burned with the formation of various gases, chiefly carbon 
dioxid and water, leaving no solid residue. The mineral 
matters will not burn, and are left behind when organic matter 
is ignited. By analysis the nutrients have been found to be 
made up of a comparatively small number of chemical elements 
in varying combinations. These are nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, 
hydrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, calcium, magnesium, sodium, 
potassium, silicon, chlorin, fluorin, and iron. Doubtless no 
single nutrient contains all these elements. The body tissues 
and fluids contain nitrogen ; and hence protein, which, alone 
supplies nitrogen to the body, is a necessary factor in food. 
All the nutrients except mineral matter contain carbon, oxygen.

and hydrogen, and can supply them to the body. Protein, fat, 
and carbohydrates are all sources, of energy. 

The value of a food as a source of material for building and 
repairing the body is shown by its chemical composition — that 
is, by the amount of digestible nutrients which it contains. 
Some other means are necessary to show its value as a source 
of energy. It is known that all energy may be measured in 
terms of heat. In order to have some measure for expressing 
the amount of heat the calorie is taken as a unit. Roughly 
speaking, this is the amount of heat required to raise the 
temperature of 1 pound of water 4*^ F. One pound of starch 
would, if burned and all the heat utilized, raise 1,900 pounds 
of water 4° in temperature ; or it would raise 5 gallons of 
water from the freezing point to the boiling point, but would 
not cause it to boil. 

The number of calories which different foods will supply 
may be determined by burning them in an apparatus called a 
calorimeter, or by taking the sum of the calories which it is 
calculated the protein, fat, and carbohydrates making up the 
food would furnish. It has been found by experiment that 
the fuel value of a pound of protein as ordinarily burned in 
the body is 1,860 calories ; the fuel value of a pound of carbo- 
hydrates is the same, while that of a pound of fat is 2.25 
times as great. 

The value of a food is usually judged by several different 
standards. Thus it must be digestible and palatable, furnish 
the nutrients needed by the system in proper amounts, and be 
reasonably cheap. 

The relative nutritive value of any food may be learned by 
comparing its composition and energy value with similar data 
for other foods. Table 1 shows the composition of a number 
of food fishes, fresh and preserved in a variety of ways ; 
oysters, clams, and other mollusks ; lobsters, shrimps, crawfish, 
and crabs ; turtle and terrapin, and frogs' legs. For purposes 
of comparison the analyses of a number of kinds of meat, 
vegetables, and other common food materials, are included. 

In several cases the analysis of fish, whole and dressed, is 
given. Usually the composition of the dressed fish was com- 
puted from that of whole fish with the aid of the figures for 
loss of weight in dressing for market, mentioned on page 6.

16 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

The above list includes the more important food fishes, 
water invertebrates, etc. There are numbers of other fish 
which are eaten to a greater or less extent. In general it may 
be said their composition would be similar to that of the fishes 
included in the table. 

In a number of cases cited in the table above more than one 
specimen was analyzed, although only the averages are given 
in the table. In such cases the samples showed more or less 
variation in total nutrients, but the variation was due more 
especially to the fats. Thus the fat in the flesh of seven 
specimens of shad ranged from 6.5 to 13.6 per cent ; in fresh 
mackerel from 2.2 to 16.3 per cent, and in fresh halibut from 
2.2 to 10.6 per cent. The protein and ash or mineral matter 
remained practically the same in all the specimens where the 
wide fat variation was noticeable, an increase of fat being 
accompanied by a decrease of water. 

An extended study of the chemical composition of fish was 
recently carried on at the zoological station at Naples by 
Lichtenfelt. It was found that the composition of the muscu- 
lar tissue changes periodically with age, nutrition, and repro- 
duction. Under the influence of hunger the amount of water 
in the flesh is increased and the proportion of solids dimin- 
ished. The richer the muscles in fat, the greater the loss as 
compared with lean fish. The amount of protein is also 
diminished not only in salmon, but in other sorts of fish. The 
amount of insoluble proteids is decreased while the propor- 
tion of soluble proteids may be either increased or lowered 
according to circumstances. Muscular activity in connection 
with hunger seems a condition especially suited to induce an 
increase of soluble proteids in fish flesh. 

It will be seen from the table that fish is essentially a 
nitrogenous food. In this it resembles meat. Neither fish 
nor meat is a source of carbohydrates. Oysters and other 
shellfish contain some carbohydrates, but the foods which 
supply this group of nutrients most abundantly are sugar and 
the cereal grains. The place of fish in the diet, if judged by 
its composition, is therefore the same as that of meat — that 
is, it supplements cereals and other vegetables, the most of 
which, as wheat, rye, maize, rice, potatoes, etc., are deficient in 
protein, the chief nutrient in the flesh of fish. As regards 
the relative nutritive value of meat and fish, Atwater's con- 
clusion, from a large number of investigations, was that the 
only considerable difference is in the proportion of water and 



FISH AS FOOD. 17 

fat present, the flesh of the fish having water where meat has 
fat. 

From the standpoint of both nutritive value and palatability 
fish, according to a recent German investigator, is an important 
food product and, as shown by his experiments, equal to beef 
as a source of energy in the diet. It produces the same sensa- 
tion of satiety and this persists for as long a time. It was 
found that fish caused the excretion of a smaller amount of 
uric acid than meat. 

In general, it may be said that fish, meat, eggs, milk, etc., 
also cereals and vegetable foods, all supply fat, the amount 
varying in the different materials. Fish usually contains less 
fat than is found in meat. There is, however, much difference 
in the fat c6ntent of the various kinds of fish. They may, 
indeed, be roughly divided into three classes : The first class 
would include those containing over 5 per cent fat; the 
second, those containing between 2 and 5 per cent, and the 
third, those containing less than 2 per cent. The first group 
would include such fish as salmon, shad, herring, Spanish 
mackerel, and butter-fish ; the second, whitefish, mackerel, 
mullet, halibut, and porgy ; the third, smelt, black bass, blue- 
fish, white perch, weakfish, brook trout, hake, flounder, yellow 
perch, pike, pickerel, sea bass, cod, and haddock. 

As regards nitrogenous constituents, fish flesh contains more 
gelatin-yielding material (collagen) and less extractive material 
(meat bases) than meat. As is well known, the characteristic 
red color of blood and muscular tissue is due to the presence of 
a substance called hemoglobin. The flesh and blood of fish 
contain less of this and allied coloring matters than meat, 
which accounts for the light color commonly observed in fish 
flesh. The flesh of some fishes, like salmon, has a decided 
color. It is not due, however, to hemoglobin, but to the 
presence of a special pigment. 

The so-called nitrogenous extractives ("meat extract"), 
contained in small quantities in fish as in other animal foods, 
are doubtless useful in nutrition, although opinions have 
differed as to their real function. Kecent investigations indi- 
cate very strongly that flesh extractives play an important 
part in stomach digestion, as they have been shown to induce 
an abundant flow of normal gastric juice. Many of the ordi- 
nary food materials possess this property also, but the flesh 
extractives seem to be especially suited to the purpose. They 
do not, it is true, furnish the body much food material, but 



18 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

they are nevertheless important if they normally help it to 
digest other foods. 

With the exception of a few kinds which are preserved 
whole, preserved fish, as a rule, show a small percentage of 
refuse. The percentage of actual nutrients is much larger 
than in the corresponding fresh fish, owing to the removal of 
a large part of the refuse and more or less water. The gain 
in nutrients is mostly represented by protein, which is the 
most valuable nutrient. 

Dried fish is richer in nutritive material, pound for pound, 
than fresh fish, since it has been concentrated by evaporation. 
It has been found that the average loss in weight in drying is 
about 30 per cent, or less than the average values for different 
kinds of meat. The loss in weight is chiefly due to the 
evaporation of water, though in some cases dried fish contains 
a little less ether extract than fresh fish. 

When foods are cooked there is, generally speaking, a loss 
of weight owing to the evaporation of water, and in the 
ordinary methods of cooking fish and meat some nutritive 
material is lost also. In recent experiments it was found that 
the water in which fish was boiled contained 9 to 11 per cent 
of the total fish protein. 

Canned fish, which is in effect cooked fish, compares favor- 
ably as regards composition with the fresh material. Generally 
speaking, the amount of refuse is small, since the portions 
commonly rejected in preparation for the table have been 
removed before canning. 

The various kinds of shellfish resemble meat and food fishes 
in general composition. They contain, however, an appre- 
ciable amount of carbohydrates. Oysters are the most impor- 
tant of the shellfish, judging by the relative amount consumed. 
Speaking roughly, a quart of oysters contains on an average 
about the same quantity of actual nutritive substance as a 
quart of milk, or three-fourths of a pound of beef, or 2 
pounds of fresh codfish, or a pound of bread ; but, while the 
weight of actual nutriment in the different quantities of food 
materials named is very nearly the same, the kind is widely 
different. That of the lean meat or codfish consists mostly 
of protein, the substance whose principal function is to make 
or repair blood, muscle, tendon, bone, brain, and other nitroge- 
nous tissues. That of bread contains considerable protein, 
but a much larger proportion of starch, with a little fat and 
other compounds which supply the body with heat and muscu-

lar power. The nutritive substance of oysters contains con- 
siderable protein and energy-yielding ingredients. Oysters 
come nearer to milk than almost any other common food 
material as regards both the amounts and the relative propor- 
tions of nutrients. 

Apparently as the oyster grows older, at least up to a certain 
time, not only do the proportions of flesh and liquids increase 
more rapidly than the shells, but the proportion of nutrients 
in the edible portion increases also ; that is to say, 100 pounds 
of young oysters in the shell appear to contain less of flesh 
and of liquids than 100 pounds of older ones, and when both 
have been shucked a pound of shell contents from the older 
oysters would contain more nutriment than a pound from the 
younger. 

Considering the edible portion of the oyster, after it has 
been removed from the shell, the differences in different 
specimens are much greater than is commonly supposed. 
This is apparent when a comparison is made of either the 
flesh (meat) or liquids (liquor) of different specimens, or the 
whole edible portion, the meat (solids) and liquor together. 
The percentage of water in the edible portion of different 
specimens of oysters which were analyzed in experiments con- 
ducted for the United States Fish Commission varied from 
about 83.4 to 91.4 per cent, and averaged 87.3 per cent. This 
makes the amounts of " water-free substance," i.e., actually 
nutritive ingredients, vary from 16.6 to ^.Q and average 12.7 
per cent of the whole weight of the edible portion (shell 
contents) of the animals. In other words, the nutritive 
material in a quart (about 2 pounds) of shell contents 
(solids) varied from 2.75 to 5.33 ounces. 

With oysters, long clams, and round clams in the shell 
there is naturally a large percentage of waste, as the shell 
constitutes a large proportion of the total weight. The 
average of 34 specimens of oysters in the shell, for instance, 
shows only 2.3 per cent of actual nutrients. Clams and 
mussels show a somewhat higher percentage. 

Where these various shellfish are purchased as " solids " — 
that is, removed from the shell — a comparatively high price 
is usually paid. Where they are purchased in the shell, there 
is a very large percentage of waste. The conclusion is there- 
fore warranted that, from a pecuniary standpoint, they are 
not the most economical of foods for the consumer. On the 
other hand, they have a useful place in the diet in helping to 



20 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD, 

supply the variety which is apparently needed to insure the 
best workings of the digestive system. Often flavor has a 
value which cannot be estimated in dollars and cents. 

It does not seem probable that the oysters would secure 
food enough to make appreciable gain in weight in the short 
time in which they remain in the fresh or brackish water. 

It is known that when a solution of salts is separated by a 
suitable membrane from water containing a lesser quantity of 
salts in solution that the passage of salts immediately begins 
from the concentrated to the dilute solution. This is practi- 
cally the condition which exists when the oyster is transferred 
from salt to fresh or brackish water. The fleshy portions of 
the body which are inclosed in a membrane contain salts in 
solution. As long as the oyster stays in salt water the solu- 
tion of salts within its body would naturally be in equilibrium 
with the water outside. When the oyster is brought into 
fresh or brackish water, i.e., into a more dilute solution, it 
might be expected that the salts in the more concentrated 
solution within the body would pass out and a larger amount 
of fresh water enter and produce such a distention as actually 
takes place during floating. Careful experiments have shown 
that this supposition is entirely correct — that is, the oysters 
actually gain in weight. This is due largely to the fact that 
they lose mineral matter and gain a considerable amount of 
water. At the same time there is a slight loss of nutrients. 
When in their natural condition oysters contain from one- 
eighth to one-fifth more nutritive material than when fattened. 
In the opinion of very many consumers the improvement in 
appearance and flavor due to the removal of the salts more 
than compensates for the loss in nutritive value. It seems 
also to be a matter of common opinion that oysters keep 
better when part of the salts has been removed by '' floating." 
However, the experiments of the New Jersey Experiment 
Stations have shown that freshened oysters will not remain 
alive as long as those taken directly from salt water. Fresh- 
ening increases very rapidly the rate of weakening and decay 
(the life period being reduced one-half). 

Frequently oysters become more or less green in color 
There is a widespread opinion that " greening " is injurious. 
The color has been attributed to disease, to parasites, and to 
the presence of copper. 

Experiments have shown that quite commonly the green 
color of American oysters at least is due to the fact that they 



FISH AS FOOD. 21 

have fed on green plants of very simple structure which, are 
sometimes found to be abundant in salt or brackish waters. 
The green coloring matter of the plants is dissolved by the 
oyster juices and colors the tissues. The opinion of those 
who have investigated the matter carefully is that such green 
color is harmless. It may be removed, if desired, by placing 
the live oysters for a time in water where the green plants are 
not abundant. In Europe similar green oysters, called " groen- 
barden " or " Marennes," are especially prized, and to meet 
the demand oysters are greened by placing them as soon as 
captured in sea water, where they are kept for months and fed 
on a species of seaweed which imparts the coloring matter to 
the gills. 

From carefully conducted investigations it appears that in 
some cases green oysters owe their color to the presence of 
copper. Such oysters are not generally considered wholesome. 
Green oysters containing copper differ in appearance from 
those owing their green tint to vegetable coloring matter, 
being grass green and not dark green in color and having a 
verdigris-like slimy secretion on the folds of the mantle. It 
is said that after the addition of vinegar a steel fork stuck 
into such oysters becomes coated with copper and that if 
ammonia is added the oysters become dark blue. 

As will be seen by the figures in Table 1, fresh and 
canned abalone correspond quite closely to oyster and clam 
products similarly prepared. As shown by some tests carried 
on by Jaffa and Mendel, abalone flesh is especially rich in 
glycogen. This fact is also emphasized by the figures in the 
table above, especially those for dried abalone, which are 
quoted from unpublished analyses made by Jaffa at the Cali- 
fornia Experiment Station. Generally speaking, compared 
with othei sea products, the abalone is a nutritious food. Its 
flavor is said, by those who are familiar with it, to be excel- 
lent. Large quantities of abalone are canned, the flesh being 
cut into pieces of suitable size. Abalone is also dried exten- 
sively, the canned and the dried products finding a ready 
market among the Chinese. 

Lobsters, crabs, shrimps, and crawfish are shown by analy- 
sis to contain a fairly large percentage of nutrients, as is 
especially noticeable when the composition of the flesh alone 
is considered. They resemble the lean rather than the fat 
fish in composition. Lobsters and crabs are very much alike 
as regards the structure of the flesh, which in each case con-

sists of coarse dense-walled fibers. Lobsters and similar 
foods are prized for their delicate flavor. Except in certain 
regions where they are very abundant and the cost corre- 
spondingly low, they must be regarded as delicacies rather 
than as staple articles of diet. This is, however, a condition 
entirely apart from their composition. Judged by this alone, 
they are valuable foods, and may profitably be employed to 
give variety to the diet. 

Although the total amount of turtle and terrapin used in 
the United States is quite large, the quantity is small as com- 
pared with the consumption of such foods as fish proper and 
oysters. As shown by their composition, turtle and terrapin 
are nutritious foods, although, under existing conditions, they 
are expensive delicacies rather than staple and economical 
articles of diet. 

The total amount of frogs consumed per year for food is 
considerable. As shown by analysis, frogs' legs contain a 
fairly high percentage of protein. Only the hind legs are 
commonly eaten. The meat on other portions of the body is 
edible, although the amount is small, and is eaten in some 
localities. The prejudice which formerly existed against 
frogs' legs as a food was doubtless based on their appearance 
or some similar reason, as they are known to be wholesome. 

COST OF PROTEIN AND ENERGY IN FISH AND OTHER 

FOOD MATERIALS. 

As previously stated, the two functions of food are to 
furnish protein for building and repairing the body and to 
supply energy for heat and muscular work. Although fish 
and meats in general may be regarded as sources of protein, 
they nevertheless furnish considerable energy. Indeed, those 
containing an abundance of fat supply a large amount of 
energy — that is, have a high fuel value. If a food contains 
little protein or energy and is high in price, it is evident that 
it is really expensive. On the other hand, a food may be high 
in price but in reality be cheap, if it furnishes a large amount 
of protein or energy or both. Foods which supply an abund- 
ance of protein or energy or both at a reasonable price are 
evidently of the greatest importance from the standpoint of 
economy. 

In Table 2 is shown how much a pound of protein, or 
1,000 calories of energy, would cost when supplied by a num-

ber of kinds of fish and other foods at certain prices, and also 
the amount of total food, protein, and energy which 10 cents' 
worth of the fish and other food materials would furnish.

In the table the prices per pound have been selected from 
the best data available. It is of course impossible to set any 
one price which shall represent the cost of these materials per 
pound in all sections of the country and at all times of the 
year. It is probable that the prices given represent more 
nearly those found in the eastern part of the United States 



24 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

than in the southern, central, and western sections, where 
some food materials are usually somewhat cheaper. 

It is to be noted that the cost of 1 pound of protein and 
1,000 calories of energy have no direct relation to each other. 
A pound of protein would be sufficient for a workingman about 
four days, while 1,000 calories of energy would be less than 
one-third the amount required per day. By dividing the cost 
of 1 pound of protein by 4 and multiplying the cost of 1,000 
calories of energy by 3.5, results are obtained which show 
approximately the relative cost of the protein and energy 
sufficient for one day as furnished by the different food 
materials. Thus it would take, in round numbers, 25 cents' 
worth of salt mackerel at 10 cents a pound to furnish 
one day's supply of protein, while the corresponding energy 
would require 38 cents' worth. Seven cents* worth of flour 
would furnish the protein and 5 cents' worth the energy 
required for one day. It is of course understood that no one 
food material could furnish the nutrieots in their proper 
proportions for adults under ordinary conditions of health and 
activity. The values expressed in the table simply show the 
relative value from a pecuniary standpoint of the different 
foods as a source of protein on the one hand and of energy on 
the other. 

It will be seen from the above table that at 25 cents a 
pound it would take $1.52 worth of sirloin steak to furnish 
a pound of protein, while the same amount could be obtained 
in 74 cents' worth of beef round at 14 cents a pound, 71 cents' 
worth of cod steak at 12 cents a pound, 44 cents' worth of 
salt cod at 7 cents a pound, or 26 cents' worth of wheat flour 
at 3 cents a pound. In like manner the cost of 1,000 calories 
of energy would vary in these same food materials from 36 
cents, as furnished by the cod steaks, to 2 cents as furnished 
by the flour. 

It is evident that at the prices given the fruits are the most 
expensive sources of protein, mollusks and crustaceans next, 
and the cheaper meats and fish, with the cereals, the least 
expensive. As regards energy, on the other hand, mollusks 
and crustaceans are by far the most expensive sources, fol- 
lowed by fish and many kinds of meat, while the cereals are 
the most economical. 



FISH AS FOOD, 25 



DIGESTIBILITY OF FISH. 



The term digestibility, as commonly employed, has several 
significations. To many persons it conveys the idea that a 
particular food agrees with the user. It is also very commonly 
understood to refer to ease or rapidity of digestion. One food 
is often said to be preferable to another because it is more 
digestible — i.e., is digested in less time in the stomach, or is 
apparently digested more readily. A third meaning, and one 
which is usually understood in scientific treatises on such 
subjects, refers to the completeness of digestion. For instance, 
two foods may have the same composition,- but, owing to 
differences in mechanical condition or some other factor, one 
may be much more completely digestible than the other — 
that is, give up more material to the body in its passage 
through the intestinal tract. 

The agreement or disagreement of a particular food with 
any person in normal health is largely a matter of individual 
peculiarity. When foods habitually disagree with a person, 
and there is reason to believe that there is pronounced indiges- 
tion the advice of a competent physician is needed, since the 
nourishment of an abnormal or diseased body is a matter 
properly included under the practice of medicine. 

In so far as ease or rapidity of digestion implies a saving 
of energy to the body, it may be a matter of importance, 
especially if the energy expenditure would otherwise be above 
the normal. However, little is known concerning relative 
rapidity of digestion within the body. Most of the current 
statements which refer to this are apparently based on experi- 
ments carried on outside the body by methods of artificial 
digestion. Such experiments imitate as closely as possible the 
conditions in the body, but it is not at all certain that they 
are exactly the same. Some experiments with man, which 
were made a good many years ago, before experimental 
methods had become fixpd, are also often quoted, but it is 
only fair to say that the popular interpretation of the data 
recorded does not agree in many respects with that of trained 
investigators. 

The numerous artificial digestion experiments which have 
been made with fish indicate that it is less quickly digested 
than beef, being about equal to lamb in this respect. However, 
as compared with other foods, the difference in the digestibility 
of fish and meat, as shown by these experiments, is not very 



26 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

great. In some carefully conducted experiments, which were 
reported only a few years ago by a German investigator, it 
was noted that oysters, whitefish, and shellfish, taken in 
moderate amounts, left the stomach in two to three hours, 
in this respect resembling eggs, milk, white bread, and some 
other foods. Caviar left the stomach in three to four hours, 
as did also chicken, lean beef, boiled ham, beefsteak, coarse 
bread, etc. Salt herring left the stomach in four to five hours, 
other foods in the same class being smoked tongue, roast beef, 
roast goose, lentil porridge, and peas porridge. So far as fish 
is concerned, the general deduction from these experiments 
was that it is more rapidly digested than meat. With respect 
to its rapidity of digestion in the stomach, another German 
investigator includes whitefish in the same class as the follow- 
ing animal foods : Hoast chicken, pigeon, roast veal, and cold 
underdone roast beef. 

Before sweeping deductions are made the thoroughness with 
which fish is digested should also be taken into account. A 
number of experiments have been made with man to learn 
how thoroughly fish is digested and to compare it in this 
respect with other foods. In these experiments the food 
and the feces were analyzed. Deducting the nutritive material 
excreted in the feces from the total amount consumed in the 
food showed how much was retained by the body. It was 
found that fish and lean beef were about equally digestible. 
In each case about 95 per cent of the total dry matter, 97 per 
cent of the protein, and over 90 per cent of the fat were 
retained by the body. Other experiments of the same char- 
acter indicate that salt fish is less thoroughly digested than 
fresh fish. 

At the Connecticut (Storrs) Station Milner studied the 
digestibility of fresh (canned) salmon, a typical fat fish, and 
fresh cod, a typical lean fish, these materials each constituting 
a considerable part of a simple mixed diet. The calculated 
coefficients of digestibility of the salmon alone were protein 
96.2 per cent and fat 97 per cent, while Sd.Q per cent of the 
energy was available. In the case of the cod the values for 
protein and fat were 95.9 and 97.4 per cent, respectively, and 
for energy 80.3 per cent. It has been suggested that fat fish 
is less thoroughly digested than lean fish, but in these experi- 
ments the two sorts were digested on an average with practi- 
cally the same thoroughness. 

A number of similar experiments have been made on the 



FISH AS FOOD. 27 

digestibility of milk, eggs, bread, potatoes, and other animal 
and vegetable foods. From a large amount of data of this 
sort some general deductions have been drawn. Thus, it has 
been calculated that 97 per cent of the protein and 95 per 
cent of the fat of meats, tish, eggs, dairy products, and the 
animal food of a mixed diet are digested. Similar values are 
for the protein of cereals 85 per cent, for the fat 90 per cent, 
and for the carbohydrates 98 per cent ; and for the protein, 
fat, and carbohydrates of vegetables 83, 90, and 95 per cent, 
respectively, and for the protein, fat, and carbohydrates of 
the total vegetable food of a mixed diet 84, 90, and 97 per 
cent. From the available experimental data it also seems 
probable that leaner meats are more easily digested than those 
containing more fat, and the leaner kinds of fish, such as cod, 
haddock, perch, pike, bluefish, etc., are more easily and readily 
digested than the fatter kinds, as salmon, shad, and mackerel. 
Generally speaking, it has been found that the protein of 
vegetable foods as served on the table is less digestible than 
that of animal foods. For instance, one-fourth or more of the 
protein of potatoes and beans may escape digestion and thus 
be useless for nourishment. This is perhaps entirely due to 
the mechanical condition in which the protein occurs in vegeta- 
ble foods ; that is, it is often inclosed in cells which have hard 
walls and are not acted upon by the digestive juices. It is 
ordinarily assumed that the small amount of carbohydrates in 
meat and lish is entirely digested. Carbohydrates other than 
fiber, which make up the larger part of the vegetable foods, are 
very digestible. The fat in both animal and vegetable foods 
differs in digestibility under varying conditions. jSTo marked 
difference in the digestibility of the fat in the two classes of 
food can be pointed out. 

Persons differ in respect to the action of foods in the diges- 
tive apparatus ; and fish, like other food materials, is subject 
to these influences of personal peculiarity. 

The nutritive value of shellfish, as of other fish, depends to 
a considerable extent upon its digestibility, but information on 
this point is so limited that but little can be said with certainty 
here. Perhaps the most that can be said is that while there 
are people with whom such foods do not always agree, yet 
oysters belong to the more easily digestible class of foods. 
In a recently published study of the composition of the oyster 
and other problems connected with their food value, the state- 
ment is made that the nutrients occur largely in forms in which 



28 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

they are readily assimilated, as is shown by the fact that one- 
half of the crushed oyster and one-fourth of the whole oyster 
is soluble in water. So far as can be learned no experiments 
have been made which show how thoroughly clams, crabs, and 
other Crustacea, turtle, and terrapin, and frogs' legs are 
digested. 

PLACE OF FISH IN THE DIET. 

The chief uses of fish as food are (1) to furnish an economi- 
cal source of nitrogenous nutrients and (2) to supply the 
demand for variety in the diet, which increases with the 
advance of civilization. 

Inspection of a considerable number of dietary studies of 
families of farmers, mechanics, professional men, and others, 
carried on in different regions of the United States, shows 
that about 20 per cent of the total food, 43 per cent of the 
total protein, and 55 per cent of the total fat of the diet of 
the average family is obtained from meats, poultry, fish, shell- 
fish, etc., together. Fish, shellfish, etc., alone furnish less 
than 3 per cent of the total food, less than 4 per cent of the 
total protein, and less than 1 per cent of the total fat, show- 
ing to what a limited extent such food is used in the average 
household. It is not improbable that in communities where 
fisheries constitute the principal industry much larger quanti- 
ties are consumed. It has been found that the laborers 
employed in the fisheries in Russia consume from 26 to 62 
ounces of fish daily. This, with some bread, millet meal, and 
tea, constitutes the diet throughout the fishing season. These 
quantities are unusually large, but no bad effects are men- 
tioned as following the diet. 

There is a widespread notion that fish contains large pro- 
portions of phosphorus, and on that account is particularly 
valuable as brain food. The percentages of phosphorus in 
specimens thus far analyzed are not larger than are found in 
the flesh of other animals used for food. But, even if the 
flesh be richer in phosphorus, there is no experimental 
evidence to warrant the assumption that fish is more valuable 
than meats or other food material for the nourishment of the 
brain. 

The opinion of eminent physiologists is that phosphorus 
is no more essential to the brain than nitrogen, potassium, or 
any other element which occurs in its tissues. The value 



FISH AS FOOD, 29 

commonly attributed to the phosphorus is based on a popular 
misconception of statements by one of the early writers on 
such topics. In discussing the belief that " fish contains 
certain elements which are adapted in a special manner to 
renovate the brain and so to support mental labor " a promi- 
nent physiologist says, " There is no foundation whatever for 
this view." 

It is well understood that persons in varying conditions of 
life and occupation require different kinds and quantities of 
food. For the laboring man doing heavy work the diet must 
contain a comparatively large amount of the fuel ingredients 
and enough of the flesh-forming substances to make good the 
wear and tear of the body. These materials are all present 
in the flesh of animals, but not in the requisite proportions. 
Fish and the leaner kinds of meat are deficient in materials 
which yield heat and muscular power. When, however, fish 
and meat are supplemented by bread, potatoes, etc., a diet is 
provided which will supply all the demands of the body. 
Where fish can be obtained at low cost it may advantageously 
furnish a considerable portion of the protein required, and 
under most conditions its use may be profitably extended 
solely on the plea of variety. 

It should be stated that most physiologists regard fish as a 
particularly desirable food for persons of sedentary habits, 
because it seems to be less '* hearty." While, so far as can be 
learned, such statements do not depend upon experimental 
evidence, they are thought to embody the result of experience. 

PREPARING FISH FOR THE TABLE. 

Fish is prepared for the table in a variety of ways, which 
are described in detail in books devoted to cookery. A few 
words, however, may not be inappropriate on the general 
methods of cooking and possible loss of nutrients involved. 

Fish is commonly boiled, steamed, broiled, fried, or baked, 
or may be combined with other materials in some made dish. 
When boiled, it is stated that the loss in weight ranges from 
5 to 30 per cent. One experimenter gives 26 per cent as the 
average. This loss is largely made up of water — that is, 
the cooked fish is much less moist than the raw. Little fat or 
protein is lost. So far as known, experiments have not been 
made which show the losses by other methods of cooking. It 



30 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

is, however, probable that there would be usually a very con- 
siderable loss of water. 

In most cases fat or carbohydrates in the form of butter, 
flour, or other material are added to fish when cooked, and 
thus the deficiency in fuel ingredients is made good. Boiled 
or steamed fish is often accompanied by a rich sauce, made 
from butter, eggs, etc. Fried fish is cooked in fat, and baked 
fish is often filled with force meat, and may also be accom- 
panied by a sauce ; the force meat being made of bread, but- 
ter, etc., contains fat and carbohydrates. In made dishes — 
chowders, fish, pies, salads, etc. — fat and carbohydrates 
(butter, flour, vegetables, etc.) are combined with fish, the 
kind and amount varying in the individual cases. Further- 
more, in the ordinary household, fish or meat is supplemented 
by such foods as bread, butter, potatoes, green vegetables, and 
fruit. That is, by adding materials in cooking and by serving 
other dishes with the cooked product the protein of the fish is 
supplemented by the necessary fat and carbohydrates. 

DAILY MENUS CONTAINING FISH. 

By taking into account the chemical composition of a mixed 
diet and comparing it with accepted dietary standards it may 
be seen whether the diet is actually suited to the requirements 
of the body ; that is, whether it supplies sufficient protein and 
energy and whether it supplies them in the right proportions. 

A number of sample menus are given on pages 32 to 36, 
which show that the desired amounts of protein and energy 
may be readily supplied by a diet containing a considerable 
amount of fish. These menus (which are based in part on 
dietary studies and other food investigations of this Depart- 
ment covering a wide range and extending over several years) 
are not intended as formulas for any family to follow, but 
simply as illustrations of the way in which menus containing 
the proper proportions of nutrients may be made up. The 
ingenuity of the housewife and her knowledge of the tastes 
of the family wdll suggest the special dishes and combinations 
suited to her needs. It is not assumed that any housewife 
will find it convenient to. follow exactly the proportions sug- 
gested in the menus. The purpose is to show her about what 
amounts and proportions of food materials would give the 
required nutrients. 

In selecting these menus it has been the object to include 



FISH AS FOOD. 31 

such amounts of fish as might be commonly served in an 
ordinary household and not to provide meals with the largest 
possible quantity of fish. That the amount which it is pos- 
sible to introduce in a single meal may be large is shown 
by the " shore dinners " so common in some regions of New 
England, or by the famous dinners served at Greenwich on the 
Thames, with six courses and fish in every course. 

With reference to the following menus several points should 
be borne in mind. The amounts given represent about what 
would be called for in a family whose demand for food would 
be equivalent to four full-grown men at light to moderate 
manual labor, such as machinists, carpenters, mill workers, 
farmers, truckmen, etc., according to the usually accepted 
dietary standards. It is ordinarily assumed that an average 
man in health performing light to moderate muscular work 
requires per day about .25 pound protein and 3,050 calories of 
energy, the latter being supplied in small part by protein, but 
mostly by fat and carbohydrates. Men in professional life, 
performing less muscular work, require smaller amounts. The 
commonly accepted American dietary standard for such men 
calls for .22 pound protein and 2,700 calories of energy in the 
daily food. The amount of mineral matter required is not 
stated, since there is little accurate information available on 
this point. A diet made up of ordinary foods and supplying 
the necessary amounts of protein and energy would undoubtedly 
supply an abundance of mineral matter. 

It has been found that women and children consume some- 
what less food than men. The assumption is usually made 
that, provided a woman is engaged in some moderately active 
occupation, she requires about eight-tenths as much food as a 
man with a similar amount of work. 

In calculating the results of dietary studies (which may be 
most conveniently expressed in amounts for one man for one 
day), it is further assumed that a boy 13 to 14 years old and a 
girl 15 to 16 years old also require about eight-tenths as much 
food as a man at moderately active muscular labor ; a boy of 
12 and a girl 13 to 14 years old, about seven-tenths ; a boy 10 
to 11 and a girl 10 to 12 years old, about six-tenths ; a child 6 
to 9 years old, about five-tenths ; one 2 to 5, about four-tenths, 
and an infant under 2 years, about three-tenths. 

As previously stated, the quantities in the sample menus are 
for four men at moderately active muscular work or an equiva- 
lent number of men, women, and children. A family might, 



32 



RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 



for example, consist of a mechanic and wife, with four children, 
two girls of 12 and 6 and two boys of 10 and 8 years, respec- 
tively. Here it would be assumed that the man would be 
engaged at moderately hard manual work. According to the 
above factors, this family would be equal in food consumption 
to 4 men at moderate muscular exercise (1.0-|-0.8-f-0.6-j-0.6-|- 
0.5-j-0.5=4). In the same way a day laborer's family, con- 
sisting of a father and mother with three children under 7 
years of age, would be equivalent to 3 men with moderate 
muscular exercise (1.0-j-0.8-|-0.5-j-0.4-j-0.3=3), and would 
require three-fourths the quantities indicated in the following 
menus :

* Percentage composition of cooked material from unpublished data. 



FISH AS FOOD. 37 

The weights of fish, meats, and vegetables given in the 
menus are for these articles as found in the market. The fish 
and meats will include, as a rule, more or less bone, and the 
vegetables considerable skin and other parts which are inedi- 
ble and are rejected. In estimating the nutrients allowance 
is made for what has been found to be the average proportion 
of bone in different cuts of meats. In vegetables it is 
assumed that from one-sixth to one-fifth will be rejected in 
preparing them for the table. The weights of the breakfast 
cereals are for these in the dry condition before cooking. 

The values given for tea or coffee are obtained by taking 
account of the sugar and milk or cream consumed with them. 
The infusion of tea or coffee contains little, if any, nutritive 
material. The value of tea and coffee in the diet depends 
upon their agreeable flavor and mild stimulating properties. 

The calculations of the quantities of nutrients contained in 
the different foods are based upon the average percentage 
composition of these materials, some of the data being 
included in the table of composition on page 10, and the 
remainder in a previous publication of this Office."* 

The fats and carbohydrates in the different food materials 
are not shown in the menus, since the quantity of protein and 
the fuel value of the food are the values which are of special 
interest. The fuel value of the fats and carbohydrates is, of 
course, included in the figures for fuel value given. 

In the menus only such an amount of each food is indicated 
as might be completely consumed at each meal. Of course, 
in the ordinary household usually a rather larger quantity of 
the different dishes will be prepared than will be consumed at 
one meal, but the thrifty housekeeper will see to it that what 
is not used at one meal will be utilized for another. 

It is not expected that each meal or the total food of each 
individual day will have just the amounts of protein and fuel 
ingredients that make a well-balanced diet. The body is con- 
tinually storing nutritive materials and using them. It is a 
repository of nutriment which is being constantly drawn upon 
and as constantly resupplied. It is not dependent any day 
upon the food eaten that particular day. Hence an excess 
one day may be made up by a deficiency the next or vice 
versa. Healthful nourishment requires simply that the 

♦U.S. Dept. Agr., Office of Experiment Stations Bui. 28, revised.

nutrients as a whole during longer or shorter periods should 
be fitted to the actual needs of the body. 

it will be seen that in each of the menus suggested fish 
occurs in at least two meals. However, in no case is the 
amount greater than experience has shown may commonly 
occur in actual dietaries. It is not the intention to suggest 
that a diet containing such quantities of fish be followed 
every day, but rather to show that fish may be readily com- 
bined with other food materials to supply the protein and 
energy required. While it may profitably be used more fre- 
quently in many families than is at present the case, the 
quantity used is a matter to be settled by the demands of 
individual taste. 

The menus attempt to cover, as regards fish and other 
materials, a range in variety and combination such as might 
be found in an average well-to-do household. Other dishes, 
such as fish soups, chowders, fish salads, etc., might have been 
included also, and would naturally find a place on the table of 
a family fond of fish and fish products. Individual prefer- 
ences vary so much that no combination which could be 
selected would meet them all. 

Nothing has been said of the cost of the food used in the 
menus. All foods vary in price in different localities, and 
this is especially the case with fish. In general it may be 
said that a large variety of fruits, green vegetables, etc., if it 
is necessary to purchase them, increases the cost of a diet out 
of proportion to the nutritive material furnished. Such foods, 
however, are valuable, since they possess agreeable flavor and 
so render the diet appetizing. It is also generally believed 
that the acids, salts, and similar materials in fruits and vege- 
tables are of value in maintaining the body in health. The 
income of the purchaser should determine how varied the 
diet. may be. 

Fish may contain parasites, some of w^hich are injurious to 
man. These are, however, destroyed by the thorough cooking 
to which fish is usually subjected. 

Ptomaines are poisonous bodies due to the action of micro- 
organisms. They are chemical compounds of definite com- 
pounds and are elaborated by microorganisms breaking 
down the complex ingredients of animal tissues, just as 
alcohol is due to the action of yeasts breaking down sugar, 
or as acetic acid is formed from the alcohol of cider or 
wine by the yeast-like plant which produces vinegar, and 



FISH AS FOOD. 39 

which we call mother when we find it collected in masses. 
The formation of ptomaines quite generally, although not 
always, accompanies putrefaction (being greatest, it is said, 
in its early stages), and therefore great care should be taken 
to eat fish only when it is in perfectly good condition. 
Fish which has been frozen and, after thawing, kept for a time 
before it is cooked, is especially likely to contain injurious 
ptomaines. 

Decomposition can often be recognized by the odor of the 
fish, especially when it has progressed to any considerable 
extent. There are laboratory tests for showing decomposition 
at various stages and for indicating the presence of ptomaines. 

Salt water fish are in supply the entire year, that is, there 
are no closed seasons. To be good they must be solid with 
meat firm. The fresher they are the firmer will be the meat. 
Frozen fish should not be thawed out till ready to use and 
then a soaking for 1 to 2 hours in cold water is generally 
sufficient to remove the frost. 

If gills are in the fish they should be red. Bleached out 
gills are stale and the fish containing them may also be so 
considered. 

Eyes are another source to tell good fish. The fish when 
new contain bright clear eyes and the duller the eye the older 
the fish. 

The first place a fish will spoil will be along the back bone 
where blood lays. If that does not smell and looks fresh you 
can be sure the goods are fresh and fit to eat. 

REMARKS IN REGARD TO FISH. 

Fish should never stand in water, as it spoils the flavor. 
Fish should never be fried in butter. It should always be 
used while fresh. Plain boiled or mashed potatoes should 
always be served with it. Squash and green peas go very 
well with fish also. Always save all that remains after a 
meal, and warm up, to help out another dish. The remains of 
boiled fresh fish can be warmed up in a little butter, pepper, 
salt, and water, as you would stew lobster. Cold fried and 
broiled fish can be placed in a tin pan, and set into the oven ten 
minutes, when it will be found to be hot enough. Fish balls 
can be steamed for ten or fifteen minutes, and then set into 
the oven to get crisp. If you have a large piece of boiled fish, 
which you wish to serve whole, place it on a plate, and set 



40 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

into the steamer, and steam twenty minutes. If you have 
drawn butter to warm up, do not set it on the fire, but put 
into a bowl, and set the bowl into hot water. Cook butter as 
little as possible, as by cooking it becomes oily. AVhen you 
do use it, always add it three or five minutes before taking the 
dish from the fire. 

Laying fish in water has been recommended as a means of 
judging of their condition. Those which sink may be consid- 
ered undecomposed and wholesome, while those which are 
decomposing will float. 

Canned fish should never be allowed to remain long in the 
can after opening, but should be used at once. There is some 
possibility of danger from the combined action of the can con- 
tents and oxygen of the air upon the lead of the solder or the 
can itself. Furthermore, canned fish seems peculiarly suited 
to the growth of microorganisms when exposed to the air. 

Finally, fish offered for sale should be handled in a cleanly 
manner, and stored and exposed for sale under hygienic con- 
ditions. 

A kind of poisoning called mytilism, usually very fatal in 
its results, has been sometimes observed to follow the eating 
of clams. The reason for this illness is not definitely known, 
though it is attributed to a poisonous body sometimes found in 
clams, especially in the liver. Just why this poisonous body 
occurs is not known, but it is probably due to a disease or 
some abnormal condition ; furthermore, it has been noted that 
clams from some regions are quite uniformly poisonous. It is 
said that poisonous clams are less pigmented (lighter with 
radiate streaks) than wholesome clams, which are uniformly 
darkly pigmented, and that the shells of the unwholesome 
clams are more friable and broader, and that the liver is 
larger, softer, and richer in pigment and fat. A well-known 
writer on the subject recommends that the public should be 
warned against buying dead clams — that is, those which do 
not close the shell when taken out of the water — and that as 
a further precaution the liver and the broth should not be 
eaten, if cases of mytilism have recently occurred locally or 
there is any other reason to suspect the clam supply. 

Slight or serious poisoning has also been known to follow 
the eating of oysters, though fortunately American oysters 
have been seldom found to be a cause of such illness. As in 
the case of clams, the reason for such illness is not definitely 
known, but it is probably due to the occasional presence in 



FISH AS FOOD. 41 

oysters of some poisonous body due to disease or a similar 
cause. An European investigator reached the conclusion that 
oysters are generally diseased in the summer months, though 
the nature of the disease was not learned. He found that the 
diseased oysters possessed a characteristic milky appearance 
and that the liver was much enlarged, gray, and soft. It does 
not seem probable that American oysters are generally diseased 
during the summer months, as many who live in the oyster- 
producing regions eat them throughout the year, yet in view of 
the fact that bad results from eating shellfish are more fre- 
quently noticed in the summer than in the cooler months, 
possibly because they spoil more readily, omitting them from 
the bill of fare during the summer seems a wise precaution. 
Oysters dead in the shell or those which are decomposed 
should under no circumstances be eaten. When removed from 
the water good oysters close the shel], move when touched, are 
of normal size and color, and have a clear fluid inside the shell. 
In the case of oj^sters dead when taken from the water, the 
shells remain open, while those which are decomposed are dis- 
colored and very soft, have a stale odor, and show a blackish 
ring on the inside of the shell. 

Oyster beds should be free from sewage pollution, and 
oysters when " floated " or " fattened " should never be placed 
in water contaminated by sewage. Severe illness and death 
have resulted in many cases from eating raw oysters contami- 
nated with sewage containing typhoid fever germs. 

It is only just to say that the dangers from parasites, micro- 
organisms, ptomaines, and uncleanly surroundings are not 
limited to fish. Under conditions which favor the growth of 
the microorganisms, meat and other highly nitrogenous animal 
foods undergo decomposition resulting in the formation of 
ptomaines. Animal parasites may be acquired from flesh of 
various kinds if not thoroughly cooked, provided, of course, 
the flesh is infested. This danger is reduced by proper 
inspection. Vegetable foods also may become contaminated 
in various ways. The importance of measures to secure pure 
and wholesome food can hardly be overstated. The best 
interests of the people undoubtedly demand a strict and 
impartial supervision by public ofiBcers of the sale of food 
products.

Advice to the Cook. 

Great cleanliness, as well as care and attention, is required 
from a cook. Keep your hands vertj clean; try to prevent 
your nails from getting black or discolored; don't "scatter" in 
your kitchen; clean up as you go; put cold water into each 
saucepan or stewpan as you finish using it. Dry your sauce- 
pans before you put them on the shelf. Scour tins with good 
mineral soap and rinse thoroughly in hot water. In cleaning 
a frying-pan, scour the outside as well as the inside. In clean- 
ing greasy utensils, such as the soup-pot and frying-pau, wipe 
off the worst of the grease with soft paper (which can be 
burned), then soak in warm water to which soap-powder or a 
little ammonia has been added, finishing with mineral soap. 
Wash your pudding-cloths, scald and hang them to dry directly 
after using them; air them before you put them away, or they 
will be musty; keep in dry place. Be careful not to use a 
knife that has cut onions till it has been cleaned. Keep sink 
and sink-brush very clean; be careful never to throw anything 
but water down sink. Do not throw cabbage water down it; 
throw it away out of doors; its smell is very bad. Never 
have sticky plates or dishes; use very hot water for washing 
them; when greasy, change it. Take care that you look at the 
meat the butcher brings, to see that it is good. Let there be 
no waste in the kitchen. 



Rules for Kitchen. 

Without cleanliness and punctuality good cooking is impos- 
sible. Leave nothing dirty — clean and clear as you go. A 
time for everything and everything in time. A good cook 
wastes nothing. An hour lost in the morning has to be run 
after all day. Strong fire for roasting. Clear fire for broiling. 
Wash vegetables in three waters. Boil fish quickly ; meat 
slowly. Throw flour on kerosene flames. Slamming door of 
oven makes cake fall. A few drops of lemon juice makes cake 
frosting very white. Try sprinkliug powdered cloves about 
places infected with red ants. Salt in the oven under baking 
tins will prevent scorching on the bottom. Salt and vinegar 
will remove stains from discolored teacups.

How to Measure. 

One cup, or one tablespoon, or one teaspoon, means a full 
measure — all it will hold of liquid, and even with the rim, 
or edge, of dry material. 

Stir up all packed materials, like mustard, in its box, and 
sift flour before measuring. Fill cup without shaking down, 
and dip spoon in material, taking up a heaped measure, then 
with a knife scrap off toward the tip till jou have level mea- 
sure. Pack butter or cottolene in cup so there ^\i\\ be no air 
spaces. A scant cup means one-eighth less and a heaped cup 
about one-eighth more than a level cup. 

Divide a level spoon lengthwise for a half measure, and a 
half spoon crosswise for quarters or eighths. A pinch means 
about one-eighth, so does a saltspoon; less than that means a 
dash or a few grains. 

A rounded tablespoon means filled above the rim as much 
as the spoon hollow below, and equals two of level measure. It 
also equals one ounce in weight, and two rounded tablespoons 
if put together would heap a tablespoon about as high as 
would an eg^, giving us the old-time measure of "butter size 
of an Qg^,'' or two ounces, or one-fourth the cup. Butter and 
flour for sauces are commonly measured by the rounded table- 
spoon by the experienced hoasekeeper. 

Soda, cream of tartar, baking powder, salt and spices, and 
some extracts are generally measured with a teaspoon, level 
measure, for this gives the proportional amount needed for the 
cup measure of other materials.

Advice for the Care of 
Kitchen Utensils. 

Attention to details is very necessary. 

Sand or bath brick is excellent for cleaning wooden articles, 
floors, tables, etc. 

If you use limestone water an oyster shell in the tea kettle 
will receive the lime deposit. 

Boil in the coffee pot occasionally soap, water, and washing 
soda. It should always be bright to assure good coffee. 

Pans made of sheet iron are better to bake bread in than 
those made of tin. 

If skillets are very greasy a little sal soda in the water will 
neutralize the grease, and so make them much easier to wash. 

Bottles and cruets are cleaned nicely with sand and soapsuds. 

Iron pots, stoneware, jars, and crocks should have cold 
water and a little soda placed in them on the stove and allowed 
to boil before using them. 

Never allow the handled knives to be placed in hot water. 

Scrape the dough from your rolling pin and wipe with a dry 
towel, rather than wash it. 

Steel or silver may tarnish in woolen cloths. A chamois 
skin or tissue paper is very much better. 

Don't put your tinware or iron vessels away damp ; always 
dry them first. Scald out your woodenware often. 



HELPS FOR THE COOK, 47 

Don't use a brass kettle for cooking until it is thoroughly 
cleaned with salt and vinegar. 

Don't allow tea or coffee to stand in tin. 

Put a lump of camphor in the case with the silverware when 
packing it away for summer ; it will save it from discoloring. 

One teaspoonful ammonia to a teacup of water, applied with 
a rag, will clean silver perfectly. 

For cleaning tinware there is nothing better than dry flour 
applied with a newspaper. 

Dissolve a tablespoonful of turpentine in two quarts of hot 
water and use for washing glass dishes. It gives them a 
beautiful lustre. 



Practical Points. 

Cranberries, if sound in the first place, will keep all the 
winter in a keg of water. Lemons remain fresh almost indefi- 
nitely if covered with cold water which is changed weekly. 

To make carpets bright, sprinkle with damp tea-leaves and 
sweep thoroughly. Draw out grease spots by covering with a 
coarse brown paper and using a warm flat-iron. 

Pumpkin seeds are better than cheese for baiting a mouse- 
trap. 

Apply white of egg with a camel's hair brush to remove 
specks and soil from gilt frames. Eub with water in which 
onions have been boiled to removed dust and to brighten the 
gilding. 

Put a thimble over the end of a curtain-rod and the freshly 
laundered curtains will slip on easily. 

An economical cook seldom buys lard. Save all trimmings, 
skimmings and drippings, place in a saucepan and melt over a 
moderate fire. Strain into a clean pan and add to each pound 
of fat a half cup of boiling water and a pinch of soda to 
sweeten it. Boil slowly until the water is evaporated; strain 
into a tin pail and keep covered until used. 

To remove old putty easily from window frames, pass a red 
hot poker slowly over it. 

To toughen lamp chimneys and glass-ware, immerse in a 
kettle of cold water to which a tablespoonful of common salt 
has been added. Boil well, then cool slowly. 

In winter use mint vinegar instead of mint sauce with lamb. 
Wash the leaves well and put into a wide mouthed bottle 



48 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

with good vinegar; keep tightly corked for three weeks, strain 
into another bottle and cover closely until used. 

Clear boiling water will remove fruit and tea stains. 
Stretch the cloth over a basin and pour the water through the 
stain, rubbing it gently with a spoon if it seems obstinate. 

To take ink out of linen, dip the spot in pure melted tallow; 
the ink will come out with the tallow in washing. 

To kill moths in a carpet without taking it up, wet a thick 
cloth in water, lay it over the carpet and steam with a hot iron. 

Before washing colored stockings let them soak for ten 
minutes in a quart of cold water containing a tablespoonful of 
salt. They may then be washed in soap and water without 
"running.'^ 

Puckering of seams in clothing — if the machine tension is 
not too tight — may be avoided by soaking the spool of thread 
in water over night and letting it dry before using. 

To remove mildew, rub soft or dissolve soap on the spots, 
scrape chalk on them and lay them in the sun. Repeat if 
necessary. 

Household Hints. 

White of eggs is most nourishing and should be given 
freely to invalids. Beat slightly and add to tea or coffee, or 
it may be stirred into any kind of farinaceous food just before 
serving. 

To remove fruit stains from tablecloths, cover with powdered 
starch and leave this in the stain for a few hours. All the 
discoloration will then be absorbed by the starch. 

When cooking a blanc mange, while yet boiling mix a piece 
of butter with it, then you will find it turn out of the mold 
when cold without any trouble, and also that it will have a 
much glossier appearance. 

Cucumber rind, cut into thin strips and put about where 
ants abound, will invariably drive them away. 

An easy way to clean decanters or bottles with small necks 
is to chop a potato into small pieces. Put these into the de- 
canter with warm water and shake vigorously up and down. 
When the glass begins to shine, empty out the potato and rinse 
several times with cold water. 

To sweeten jars and tins which have contained tobacco, 
onions or anything else of strong odor, wash the article clean. 



HELPS FOR THE COOK, 49 

then fill it with fresh garden, earth, cover it, and let it stand 
for twenty -four hours. Then wash it and dry it, and it will be 
quite sweet and fit for use. 

If you wish to know whether your coffee is pure sprinkle 
a small quantity on the surface of a tumbler of water. Pure 
coffee floats, the adulterated article sinks to the bottom and 
discolors the water. This is a simple but effective test. 

When heating a pie stand it in a deep baking dish filled 
with boiling water and place on the stove for half an hour, 
then, twenty minutes before it is required, place it in the oven 
to heat the crust. It will be as good as if freshly cooked. 

In cases of illness, where ice is not procurable for cooling 
the head of a feverish patient, cut a strip of cucumber, peel 
rather thick and lay the inner part on the forehead. It is 
deliciously cool, and remains so for a long time. 

To thoroughly clean saucepans after cooking oatmeal, fill 
them with boiling water, empty away and then fill with cold 
water, and the oatmeal will almost fall away from the sides of 
the saucepans.

HEALTH AND FOOD. 

If the one who makes two blades of grass grow where only 
one grew before is *'a public benefactor," so is the one who 
improves the daily food of the people, either by supplying 
articles of superior excellence or by suggesting superior meth- 
ods of preparation, thus adding to the health and happiness of 
the people. 

This book is presented to the public with the purpose in 
mind of impressing the importance and suggesting methods of 
preparing the food that will add to their palatability and whole- 
someness. 

Your health and that of those dependent upon you, the

pleasures of those who eat at your table, and even economy 
appeal to you to exercise care and good judgment in buying, 
so that to be indifferent is almost criminal in these enlightened 
days. 

Health depends in a large degree upon keeping the body 
well nourished and the system working regularly; if the system 
becomes clogged, the decaying matter gradually poisons the 
entire system and headaches, stomach troubles, rheumatism, 
and almost all other troubles result. 

For the proper nourishment of the body pure and palate 
pleasing food should be prepared, the more pleasing to the eye 
and palate the more readily the food is digested; the antici- 
pated pleasure of some pleasing looking food starts the flow of 
saliva and when this is further helped by a savory smell and 
a palate tickling taste the saliva and the gastric juices make 
digestion easy. 

A very short period of rest puts the system into much better 
condition for eating. Think deliberately of the house you live 
in — your body. Make up your mind firmly not to abuse it. 
Eat nothing that will hurt it. Uo not overload it with food 
that Nature did not intend it to have. Give yourself regular 
and abundant sleep. This is the only body you will ever have 
in this world. A pinch of salt in hot water taken just before 
or just after eating greatly aids digestion and has cured many 
cases of dyspepsia. 

Eat slow; the rule should surely raise no question 
Unless you'd woo the hag called indigestion — 
The case that taught Napoleon what it cost 
To bolt a meal, in Leipsic's battle lost.

RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 



FISH, ETC. 

Baked Fish. — The best fish to bake are white fish, bass, 
pickerel, pike, red-snapper, shad, etc., all having white flesh. 
They should be basted often and a stuffing also serves to keep 
the fish moist as well as to season it. 

Clean, wipe and dry the fish. If the fish is slimy, like a 
muskalonge, scald with hot water before attempting to clean. 
Rub with salt inside and out, stuff and sew with soft darning 
cotton, leaving a large knot at one end that you can find after the 
fish is baked ; cut gashes two inches apart on each side so they 
will alternate — not opposite each other — and skewer into the 
shape of an S or O ; put the fish on a sheet, rub all over with 
soft butter, salt and pepper, and place narrow strips of salt pork 
in the gashes ; dredge with flour (or not, just as you please), and 
put into a hot oven without water ; baste with hot water and 
butter as soon as it begins to brown and repeat every ten minutes 
afterwards. Remove it carefully from the fish sheet and place it 
on a hot platter, dr^w out the string, wipe off all the water or fat 
which runs from the fish and remove the pieces of pork. Pour 
Hollandaise sauce around (not over) the fish, or serve a drawn 
butter sauce flavored with lemon, and pile Saratoga chips lightly 
around the fish. Garnish the head of the fish with parsley or 
water-cresses. Fish that have been frozen are almost sure to 
break ; if they do, fill the broken places with parsley. 

Broiled Fish, No. 1. — Large fish should be split through 
the back to broil and for most stoves the head and tail must be 
removed. Use a double wire broiler and grease it well before 
laying in the fish. Dust the fish with salt and pepper and broil 
the flesh side first till almost done, then cook on the skin side 
just long enough to brown it well. Small fish require from five 
to ten minutes. Thick ones from fifteen to twenty minutes. 
Turn a dripping pan over the broiler and it will cook more 

(55) 



56 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

evenly. There is no excuse for scorching the fish, as one can 
always scatter a few ashes over a hot fire. Spread generously 
with butter and set in the warming oven a minute to let it pene- 
trate the fish. Garnish with parsley or water-cress after taking 
from the oven. 

Broiled Fish, No. 2. — Clean, wash, and wipe dry. Split 
so that when laid flat the backbone will be in the middle, or take 
the backbone out. Sprinkle with salt and lay, inside down, upon 
a buttered gridiron over a clear fire until it is nicely colored, 
then turn. When done, put upon a hot dish, butter plentifully, 
and pepper. Put a hot cover over it and send to table. 

Fried Fish. — Fish for frying should be thoroughly dried 
after cleaning, seasoned with salt and pepper, rolled in fine bread 
crumbs, dipped in beaten egg, rolled in crumbs again, fried in 
deep fat like doughnuts ; put in only a few pieces at a time to 
avoid chilling the fat and let it reheat before frying any more. 
The temperature should not fall below 375 degrees. From two 
to five minutes is sufficient for any but extra large pieces. The 
fish is done when it rises to the top of the fat. Drain perfectly, 
dry on paper and arrange on a folded napkin. Fry the parsley 
that is to garnish the dish, taking care to have it crisp, without 
changing its color. 

Panned Fish. — This is suitable for any small fish or such as 
can be cut in slices. Have the fish well cleaned, seasoned with 
pepper and salt and dried with a little flour or, better still, very 
fine bread crumbs. Have a large frying-pan smoking hot with as 
little grease in it as will keep the fish from sticking. Dripping 
from good, sweet salt pork is the best, but any sweet dripping 
will do. When the fat begins to smoke blue lay in the fish and 
brown quickly on both sides, then cover closely and set back to 
cook more slowly, from ten to twenty minutes, according to size 
of the fish. Bass in all its varieties is suitable to cook in this 
way, so are butter-fish, cisco, perch, herring, trout, bream, etc. 

Steamed Fish. — Clean carefully, but without removing head 
or fins. Rub inside and out with salt, pepper, and lemon juice, 
laying slices of onion inside, if liked. Lay on a buttered paper 
and steam till the flesh parts easily from the bones. Lay on a 
folded napkin, dress with lemon and parsley and send to the 
table with Poulette sauce. 



FISH, ETC, 57 

Fish Broth. — Fry four ounces of butter with the following 
vegetables sliced fine : two onions, two carrots, and two leeks. 
Fry until quite dry. Then add four pounds of fish, — such as 
bass, black fish, flounder, or any bony fish, — the head of a fresh 
cod, one quart of white wine, and six quarts of water. Season 
with salt, peppercorns, bunch of parsley, and a few blades of 
mace. Cover the stew-pan and boil one-half hour. Strain the 
broth and free it from its fat. Chop up two pounds of cod or 
bass, mix with two eggs, add the broth and a few more sliced 
vegetables. Set on the fire and stir constantly until it begins to 
boil. Then let it simmer for ten minutes and strain through a 
wet cloth. Pour in a tureen with three or four dozen veal force- 
meat balls fried in hot lard. 



Baked Bass. — Wash and clean a fresh bass for baking, 
leaving on the head. Stuff the fish with the following mixture : 
two and one-half cups of fine bread crumbs, one cup of butter, 
the rind of a quarter of a lemon chopped very fine, two or three 
sprigs of parsley chopped fine, and a little sweet marjoram. 
Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Mix two well-beaten 
eggs with a little water, and add to the mixture. When the fish 
is well stuffed, sew up the opening. Score it on each side, in the 
spaces place very thin slices of salt pork. Place it in a pan with 
a little stock, and bake in a moderate oven. When thoroughly 
cooked, carefully place it on a hot dish. 

To the gravy which is left in the pan, add a little tomato sauce. 
Stir on the top of the range until it comes to a boil. Strain and 
serve in a separate dish. Garnish the fish plate with parsley and 
thin slices of lemon. 



Palmettes of Striped Bass. — Cut out six heart-shaped 

fillets from the thickest part of the bass. Season with pepper, 
salt, and the juice of half a lemon. Put under a press for one- 
half hour. Cook in clarified butter for ten minutes until a deli- 
cate brown. Make a forcemeat (the same as for fillet of 
pampano). Color the forcemeat pink and green, also have 
some white. Pour in three pastry bags. On the outside of each 
palmette put a pink border, on the inside all white with a small 
heart shape of green on the top. Set them away to get chilled. 
Have six pieces of heart-shaped oiled paper. Wrap up each 
palmette in one. Place them in a tin pan, set the pan over 
another which is half filled with water. Cook in the oven until 



58 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

the forcemeat is done, or from twenty to twenty-five minutes. 
Serve on corn-starch croustade and with HoUandaise sauce. 

Boiled Bass, or other Fish. — Put sufficient water in pot 
to enable fish, if alive, to swim easily. Add one-half cup vinegar, 
one teaspoonful salt, one onion, one dozen whole black peppers, 
one blade mace. Sew up fish in piece of clean net or muslin, 
fitted to shape. Heat slowly for first one-half hour; then boil 
eight minutes. 

Baked Bluefish. — Select a nice large bluefish, clean, and 
prepare it for baking. Wash it in salted water, and after drying 
it thoroughly, stuff with veal forcemeat for fish, or else with bread 
forcemeat, to which a few capers have been added. Sew up the 
opening and rub the fish all over with salt. Then having put 
small pieces of butter over it, place it in a large pan with enough 
water to cover the bottom, and bake in a hot oven for forty-five 
or fifty minutes. After it begins to bake, sprinkle it with a little 
salt and pepper. Baste it often with the liquid in the pan, and a 
little melted butter. When it is cooked and a nice color, remove 
carefully to a hot plate. Do not break it. Serve with a brown 
sauce, or any desired sauce poured round the fish as a garnish, or 
serve it in a separate dish. 

Broiled Bluefish, Anchovy Butter. — Procure a three- 
pound piece fresh bluefish, trim off fins and remove all bones. 
Mix on a plate a tablespoonful oil, teaspoonful salt, and one-half 
teaspoonful pepper, turn bluefish in this seasoning six or more 
times, then arrange on a broiler and broil for six minutes on each 
side. Remove to a hot serving dish, spread anchovy butter over 
it, decorate with a little green parsley and slices of lemon. 

Fried Bluefish, and other Kinds. — Clean, wipe dry, 
inside and out. Sprinkle with flour, and season with salt. Fry 
in hot butter or sweet lard. One-half lard and one-half butter 
make a good mixture for frying fish. The moment fish are done 
to good brown, take them from fat and drain in hot strainer ; 
garnish with parsley. 

Bluefish, Sweet-pepper Butter. — Remove bones, neatly 
wipe a three-pound fresh bluefish ; season all over with teaspoon- 
ful salt, half teaspoonful pepper ; rub all over with tablespoonful 
oil, then broil on brisk fire for six minutes on each side. Dress 



FISH, ETC, 59 

on hot dish, spread sweet-pepper butter over surface and keep 
dish at oven door ten* minutes, basting fish with butter once in a 
while. Remove, decorate with a little parsley and six quarters 
lemon, and serve. 

Corn-starch Croustade. — Place one pint of milk in a 
saucepan over the fire, and when it boils add two heaping table- 
spoonfuls of corn-starch, which has been dissolved in a little cold 
water, and one-half teaspoonful salt. When the mixture has 
cooked five minutes, add the white of an egg. Wet a mould 
about three-fourths of an inch deep of the desired shape and 
pour in the mixture. While hot it may be colored pink or 
green. Set away to cool. 

Fried Cod or Haddock. — Remove the skin (ask the fish- 
dealer to remove it for you), cut in square pieces and remove 
the backbone. Scrape all the fish from the bones, and press it 
with a knife into the larger pieces. Season with salt and pepper 
and roll in fine white corn meal. Fry several slices of salt pork, 
enough to have a cup of fat. Lay the fish in the hot fat, cook 
brown on each side. Drain on soft paper and serve hot. Spread 
with butter, and garnish with slices of lemon. 

Any fish having firm white flesh can be prepared in this man- 
ner and it is a vast improvement on the old method of sending 
all the bones to the table. 

Baked Cod. — Select a fresh cod, cut off the head and fins, 
draw, wash, and split it down the belly. Remove the bone from 
the thick part only, and make small lengthwise incisions in the 
skin in order to prevent the fish from curHng while it is cooking. 
Put it to soak for three hours in a dressing made as follows : 
Salt, white pepper, a little Worcestershire sauce, and some sweet 
oil. Drain and place in a pan. Baste it with melted butter and 
sprinkle with fine bread crumbs. Moisten with two glasses of 
white wine and one pint of oyster liquor. Bake in a slow oven 
and then cover with a buttered paper and bake a light brown in 
a moderate oven. Drain and thicken the liquid with a little flour 
kneaded with butter, add some lemon juice and finely chopped 
parsley. Pour this round the fish and serve. 

Small Fish Baked. — Lay in a baking dish with chopped 
onion, mushrooms and parsley, rub the fish with salt, pepper, a 
bit of nutmeg and dot with butter. Pour in enough thin broth

to cover bottom of dish, add the juice of one-half lemon and 
bake till the flesh parts easily from the bone. 

Baked Cod's Head. — Wash and thoroughly clean a cod's 
head. Stuff the gills with veal forcemeat. Place the head in a 
pan, season with salt, white pepper, and a little chopped parsley. 
Mix one pint of stock, a scant pint of Sherry wine, and a little 
tomato catsup, and pour into the pan. Cover the fish with but- 
tered paper and bake in a moderate oven. The fish must be 
well basted while it is cooking. When the head is nearly cooked, 
sprinkle it with fine bread crumbs. The average- sized head 
should bake in one hour and a quarter. Mix the liquor in the 
pan with two gills of brown sauce, strain it, and add two ounces 
of butter and a little lemon juice. Boil for four minutes and 
then pour over the fish or serve in separate dish. 

Stuffing for Baked Fish, No. 1. — For a fish weighing 
four to six pounds take one cup of cracker crumbs, one salt- 
spoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper, one teaspoonful of 
chopped onions, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one tea- 
spoonful of capers, one teaspoonful of chopped pickles. 

Bread Stuffing for Fish, No. 2. — Take about half a 
pound of stale bread and soak in water, and when soft press out 
the water ; add a very little chopped suet, pepper, salt, a large 
tablespoonful of onion minced and fried, and, if prepared, a 
little minced parsley ; cook a trifle, and after removing from the 
fire add a beaten egg. 

Bread Stuffing, No. 3. — Bread crumbs with a little chopped 
parsley and pork, salt, pepper and butter. Fill up the fish, sew 
it closely, then bake. 

Boiled Cod with Oysters, No. 1. — Put the fish into boil 
ing water, shghtly salted ; add a few white cloves and peppers and 
a bit of lemon-peel ; pull gently on the fins, and when they come 
out easily the fish is done. Arrange neatly on a folded napkin, 
garnish, and serve with oyster sauce. Take six oysters to every 
pound offish and scald (blanch) them in a half-pint of hot oyster 
liquor ; take out the oysters and add to the liquor salt, pepper, a 
bit of mace and an ounce of butter ; whip into it a gill of milk 
containing a quarter of a tablespoonful of flour. Simmer a 
moment, add the oysters, and send to table in a sauce-boat. 



FISH, ETC. 61 

Boiled Cod, No. 2. — Take the head and shoulders of a good- 
sized cod. Scrape and wash clean ; rub a handful of salt into it ; 
flour a cloth and pin the fish in it. Pat into boiling water, and 
boil half an hour. Take the fish carefully from the cloth, and 
serve with egg sauce. Potato is the only vegetable that is nice 
with boiled cod. 

Codfish Fritters. — Cut codfish into strips size of the finger. 
Freshen over night in cold water. In morning wipe dry, dip each 
piece in fritter batter and fry a nice brown in hot fat. 

Broiled Cod, or Scrod. — Split, wash, and wipe dry a small 
cod. Rub the gridiron with a piece of fat pork, and lay the fish 
upon it, bemg careful to have the inside downward. If the fish 
is very thick cook thirty minutes ; but for an ordinary one, twenty 
minutes will be sufficient. Have the dish in which you intend 
serving it warm ; place it upon the fish and turn the dish and 
gridiron over simultaneously. If the fish sticks to the gridiron 
loosen it gently with a knife. Have some butter warm, but not 
inelied, with which to season it. Shake on a little pepper and 
salt and send to the table. 

Codfish Balls, No. 1 . — Boil one cup codfish with four 
good-sized potatoes ; when done mash potatoes and fish together, 
add good-sized piece of butter, a Httle pepper and one tgg 
beaten ; roll in a little flour to form balls and place in frying-pan ; 
fry brown on one side in butter, turn and brown the other side. 

Codfish Balls, No. 2. ^ Put fish in cold water, set on back 
of stove ; when water gets hot, pour off" and put on cold again 
until fish is fresh enough ; then pick it apart. Boil potatoes and 
mash them ; mix fish and potatoes together while potatoes are 
hot, taking two-thirds potatoes and one-third fish. Put in plenty 
of butter ; make into balls and fry in plenty of lard. Have lard 
hot before putting in balls. 

Variation may be had by rolling each ball in beaten Qgg^ then 
in dry bread crumbs before frying. 

Codfish Balls, No. 3. — Trim and soak a piece of salt cod- 
fish in cold water for six or seven hours, and during that time 
change the water two or three times. Shred it. Should it be 
too salt after shredding, freshen it by frequent changes of cold 
water. There should be one quart bowl of the shredded fish.

Cover it with water and let it simmer gently until tender. It 
will not take very long. Should you boil it too much, you might 
harden it. Have ready six good-sized, fresh-boiled potatoes, 
and mash them while hot. Have the fish drained, pounded, 
and rubbed through a sieve, and mix with the three well-beaten 
eggs. Season to taste with salt — if necessary — and white 
pepper, also a small lump of butter. Drop by the tablespoonful 
into a pan of boiling hot lard and fry until a delicate brown. 
Drain on brown paper and serve very hot. 

Fish Balls, No. 4. — Take the fish left from the dinner, put 
it in your chopping tray, being careful that there are no bones in 
it ; chop fine. Pare and boil potatoes enough to have twice the 
quantity of potatoes that you have of fish. When cooked turn 
them into the tray with the fish, mash fine, and make into balls 
about the size of an egg. Flour the outside lightly ; have the fat 
boiling hot, and fry a light brown. The fat should be half lard 
and half salt pork. Have the slices of pork a nice brown, and 
serve with the fish balls. 

Fish Balls, No. 5. — Two cupfuls cold boiled codfish, fresh 
or salted. Chop the fish when you have freed it of bones and 
skin ; work in one cupful of mashed potatoes, and moisten with 
a half cup of drawn butter with an egg beaten in. Season to^ 
taste. Have them soft enough to. mold, yet firm enough to keep 
in shape. Roll the balls in flour, and fry quickly to a golden 
brown in lard or clean dripping. Take from the fat as soon as 
they are done ; lay in a colander or sieve and shake gently, to free 
them from every drop of grease. Turn out for a moment on 
white paper to absorb any lingering drops, and serve on a hot 
dish. 

Dropped Fish Balls, No. 6. — One-half pint of raw 
fish, one heaping pint of pared potatoes (let the potatoes be 
under medium size), two eggs, butter the size of an egg and a 
little pepper. Cut the fish in half-inch slices across the grain, 
and measure it lightly. Put the potatoes into the boiler and the 
fish on top of them ; then cover with boiling water and boil half 
an hour, or until tender. Drain off all the water and mash fish 
and potatoes together until fine and light. Then add the butter 
and pepper and the eggs, well beaten. Have a deep kettle of 
boiling fat. Dip a tablespoon in it and then take up a spoonful 
of the mixture, having care to get it into as good shape as pos- 



FISH, ETC. 63 

sible. Drop into the boiling fat and cook until brown, which 
should be in two minutes. Be careful not to crowd the balls and 
also that the fat is hot enough. The spoon should be dipped in 
the fat every time you take a spoonful of the mixture. These 
balls are dehcious. 

Fish Cakes. — Wash salt codfish and separate in pieces ; 
there should be one cupful. Wash, pare and soak potatoes and 
cut in pieces of uniform size ; there should be two cupfuls (heap- 
ing) . Put fish and potatoes in kettle with a generous supply of 
boiling water, and cook until potatoes are soft. Drain, return to 
kettle, mash, add one egg, well beaten, one teaspoonful butter, 
one-eighth teaspoonful pepper, and a few drops of onion juice. 
Shape in flat cakes, roll in flour and saut^ in pork fat. 

Canapes of Meat or Fish. — Toast six pieces of bread 
and cut them in good-sized squares. Beat the whites of four 
eggs to a stiff froth, put them in a pastry bag, and then make a 
border round each piece of toast. Bake in quick oven till light 
brown. Fill in the centre with creamed fish or finely minced 
creamed meat and serve very hot. 

Fish Chowder, No. 1 . — Take a fresh haddock, of three 
or four pounds, clean it well, and cut in pieces of three inches 
square. Place in the bottom of your dinner-pot five or six slices 
of salt pork, fry brown, then add three onions sliced thin, and 
fry those brown. Remove the kettle from the fire, and place on 
the onions and pork a layer of fish. Sprinkle over a little pepper 
and salt, then a layer of pared and sliced potatoes, a layer of 
fish and potatoes, till the fish is used up. Cover with water, and 
let it boil for half an hour. Pound six biscuits or crackers fine 
as meal, and pour into the pot ; and, lastly, add a pint of milk j 
let it scald well, and serve. 

Fish Chowder, No. 2. — Four pounds of fish, half cod 
and half haddock, if you can get the two kinds, two onions, six 
potatoes, eight white browns, one quarter of a pound of salt pork, 
salt, pepper. Prepare the chowder as directed in the preceding 
rule ; split the crackers and lay on the top, pour over the whole 
hot water enough to cover, and boil fifteen minutes ; then wet 
two tablespoonfuls of flour with one-third of a cup of cream. 
Stir this into the boiling chowder, let it boil up once, and serve. 



64 BECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

When you cannot get the white browns, pilot bread will answer. 
When a very strong flavor of onions is desired, use four onions. 

Fish Chowder, No. 3. — Take either a cod or haddock, skin 
it, loosen the skin about the head, and draw it down towards the 
tail, when it will peel off easily. Then run your knife dovyn the 
back close to the bone, which you take out. Cut your fish in small 
pieces and wash in cold water. Put the head on to boil in about 
two quarts of water, and boil twenty minutes. For a fish weighing 
six pounds, pare and slice f/ii'/i five good-sized potatoes and one 
onion. Place a layer of potatoes and onion in the pot, then a 
layer of fish, dredge in a little salt, pepper, and flour. Keep 
putting in alternate layers of potatoes and fish until all used. 
Use about one tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper, 
one teacup of flour, in all. 

Have ready half a pound of salt pork fried brown. Pour this 
over the mixture ; add about two quarts of cold water, then 
strain on the water in which the head has been boiled. If this is 
not water enough to cover, add more cold. Cover tight, and 
boil gently thirty minutes. If not seasoned enough, add what 
you please. When it has boiled twenty minutes, put in six 
crackers which have been soaked three minutes in cold water. If 
you wish to add milk and butter, you can do so about five 
minutes before taking it up. 

Fish Chowder, No. 4, — Skin a four-pound haddock, wash 
thoroughly, and cut the flesh from tlie bones in pieces about two 
inches square. Cover the head and bones with cold water and 
boil one-half hour. Slice two small white onions in a pan with 
four slices of thin, fat, salt pork. When tender, skim out the 
pork and onions and add the strained bone liquor and one quart 
of sliced raw potato. Cook for ten minutes, then add the fish, 
one tablespoonful of salt, and one-half teaspoonful of white 
pepper. When the potatoes are tender, add one quart of hot 
milk which has been thickened with two ounces of butter and 
flour mixed together. Do not break the fi^h by needless stirring. 
Split six butter crackers, arrange in a tureen, and pour the fish 
chowder over them.

into dice pieces ; fry to crisp, and turn the whole into chowder 
kettle. Pare six medium-sized potatoes and cut them in two. Peel 
small onion and chop fine. Put potatoes into kettle with part of 



FISH, ETC. Qb 

onion. Cut fish (which should be fresh cod or haddock) into 
convenient pieces, and lay over potatoes -, sprinkle over it rest of 
the onion. Season well with salt and pepper, add just enough 
water to come to top of fish. Pour over the whole quart can 
tomatoes ; cover closely and allow to cook about as long as takes 
to boil potatoes ; then add two quarts milk, and let it scald up 
again. Season with tomato catsup, and more salt and pepper if 
required. 

Cape Ann Fish Chowder. — This is the everyday style of 
fish chowder among the fishermen's families : Wash and cut in 
chunks two pounds of fresh cod or haddock. Pare and thinly 
sHce one quart of potatoes (or as many as you prefer) and place 
in cold water until you are ready for them. Cut two slices of 
fat salt pork in dice and slowly fry out in chowder kettle until fat 
is extracted, stirring often. Remove scraps, add one large onion 
sliced, and fry slowly for a very few minutes. Then in your kettle 
place a layer of fish and one of potatoes, salt and pepper, and 
continue that way until all is used, potatoes on top. Cover with 
cold water and let come to boil, then boil slowly or simmer, until 
potatoes are done. Mix one tablespoonful flour with one of but- 
ter, add to chowder with one pint milk. Allow to come to boil- 
ing point once more, add a few halved crackers and serve very 
hot. Cheap and delicious. 

New England Chowder. — Take a good haddock, cod, or 
any other sohd fish, cut it in pieces three inches square ; put a 
pound of fat salt pork, cut into strips, into the pot ; set it on 
hot coals and fry out the grease ; take out the pork, but leave the 
grease in the bottom of the pot, and put in a layer of fish, over 
that a layer of sliced onions, over that a layer of fish, with slips 
of fried pork, then another layer of onions and a few sliced raw 
potatoes, and so on alternately until your fish is all in ; mix some 
flour with as much water as will fill the pot ; season to suit your 
taste, and boil for half an hour ; have ready some pilot bread, 
soaked in water, and throw them into your chowder five minutes 
before taking off"; serve in a tureen. 

Colonial Codfish Pie, with Crust. — Line a deep baking 
dish with a biscuit crust. To make the crust, sift together four 
cups of flour, one heaping teaspoonful of soda, and two tea- 
spoonfuls of cream of tartar (or in place of these three heaping 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder), and one teaspoonful of salt. 



Q6 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD, 

In this rub one-half cup of shortening and about a pint of milk, 
that is, enough to make a medium soft dough. In rolUng out 
the crust spread butter on twice and fold and roll out. 

Take a pint of picked-up salt codfish, cover it with boiling 
water, let it stand two minutes and drain. Pour on more water, 
and, after it has stood, drain dry. Upon the crust of your baking 
dish put a layer of this codfish, sprinkle it with bread crumbs, 
pepper (a little salt if you find the fish fresh), small pieces of 
butter, and some cream sauce (made by thickening one pint of 
boihng milk with two teaspoonfuls of flour and seasoning with 
salt and pepper). Break over the fish, bread crumbs and season- 
ing three or four eggs, carefully preserving the yolks. Repeat 
these layers, codfish, bread crumbs, cream sauce, and eggs, put 
on the top crust, cut a few holes in the centre to let out the 
steam, and bake till the crust is a delicate brown. 

Creamed Fish. — Steam two pounds codfish, break in flakes, 
removing bones and skin. Make one pint white sauce (see Meat 
and Fish Sauces). Grease a baking dish, fill with alternate 
layers of fish and sauce, seasoning with salt, pepper, chopped 
parsley, and lemon juice or a few drops of vinegar. Mix together 
one cup dry bread crumbs and three tablespoonfuls melted 
butter ; spread over top and brown in quick oven. 

This may be varied by using tomato, bechamel, curry, or any 
other sauce, or by adding grated cheese or sliced hard-boiled 
eggs to the white sauce; by baking in shells or patty-pans in 
place of the deep dish, or by covering with mashed potato or 
biscuit crust instead of crumbs. 

Fish Loaf. — Three pounds haddock. Have head, tail, skin 
and backbone removed, so you have two sHces of solid fish. 
You can use cod, but I like haddock better. On the bottom of 
your baking pan put three slices fat pork. On this place one 
layer of the fish, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix one cup 
soft bread crumbs, little salt, pepper and one-quarter cup melted 
butter, pork fat or bacon fat and spread over the fish slice. 
Cover with the other slice of fish, sprinkle with salt and pepper 
and place three or four slices of fat pork on top. Bake about 
thirty minutes. Just before it is done remove pork, scatter one- 
half cup cracker crumbs over fish, replace pork and brown in 
oven, serve with drawn butter sauce, to which you add a hard- 
boiled egg or a white sauce. If you haven't milk enough for the 
white sauce use milk and water. 



FISH, ETC. 67 

Fish Balls. — Take one pound boneless codfish, set on stove 
in cold water (after picking it into small pieces), let it come to a 
boil, then remove, and if it is too salty do it over the same way. 
Boil potatoes and mash them. Take less potato than fish. Cut 
up a lot of all-fat pork into tiny dice shape and fry out crisp and 
brown. Put fish through a fine cutter or the meat grinder, beat 
one tgg light and mix all together. Season with pepper. Mix 
in the pork scraps, too, and if they are not moist enough to hold 
together in balls add two tablespoonfuls of the pork fat. Fry in 
the fat left from scraps till a golden brown. Make cakes or balls 
about an inch thick when molded. 

Fish Croquettes. — Put one large tablespoonful of butter in 
a saucepan. Let it bubble, then put in a little onion cut in small 
pieces, then a large spoonful of flour and some salt and pepper, 
then put in your fish and beat it up, then put the yolk of an egg 
in and beat it up. Put away to cool. When cool form into cone 
shape and roll in cracker crumbs again and fry in hot fat. They 
are nice. You can use chicken instead of fish. 

Curried Cod. — Two slices large cod, or remains of any cod- 
fish, three ounces butter, one onion sliced, a teacup of white 
stock, thickening of butter and flour, one tablespoonful of curry 
powder, one-quarter pint of cream, salt and cayenne to taste. 
Flake the fish and fry to a nice brown, color with the butter and 
onions ; put this in a stewpan, add the stock and thickening, 
simmer for ten minutes. Stir the curry powder into the cream ; 
put it with the seasoning into the other ingredients ; give one 
boil and serve. Time, three-quarters of an hour. Sufficient for 
four persons. 

Fish Cutlets. — Cut the fish in squares or in slices across the 
back, removing all the bones. Dry, dip in batter and fry in deep 
boiling lard. It is quite necessary that the lard should boil. 
When a gold color, drain till dry on brown paper and serve on a 
folded napkin with a quantity of parsley or cresses and a thin 
slice of lemon. A tomato, mayonnaise, or tartare sauce may be 
served with cutlets. 

Fish Hash. — Prepare the fish as for fish balls ; chop fine 
cold potatoes, and mix with the fish. Fry brown six good slices 
of salt pork ; take out the pork and turn the hash into the frying- 
pan ; add half a cup of boiling water ; let this heat slowly, stirring

often ; then spread smoothly, and brown, being careful not to let 
it burn. When brown, fold it as you would an omelet, dish, and 
garnish the dish with the slices of pork. When the pork is 
objected to, butter can be used instead. 

Salt fish, when cooked and chopped, will keep for a week if 
nothing else is mixed with it. When intending to have hash or 
fish balls for breakfast, the fish should be chopped the night 
before, and the potatoes should be pared and put in cold water. 
Put the potatoes on the fire as soon as it begins to burn. They 
will then be ready for use when you are ready for them. 

Fish with Green Pepper. — One and three-quarters cups 
cold cooked fish, one cup white sauce, one-half small green pep- 
per, one-half slice onion or flavor to taste with extract onion. 
Salt and pepper. 

Cut a slice from stem end of pepper, remove every seed and 
parboil pepper fifteen minutes. Make a white sauce with one 
cup milk, two tablespoonfuls butter, two tablespoonfuls flour, bit 
of bay leaf, sprig of parsley, salt and pepper to taste, scalding the 
milk with the parsley and bay leaf, cook the onion finely chopped 
in the butter three minutes, or flavor with onion extract to taste ; 
add the flour when well mingled, the milk, salt, and pepper; 
when thickened and smooth add the fish broken into flakes and 
the green pepper cut into narrow strips ; heat thoroughly, and 
serve with brown bread sandwiches. 

This is easily prepared in the chafing-dish, having the green 
pepper previously cooked. 

Fish au Gratin. — Six pounds of any fish with white meat, 
steamed, freed from skin and bone and broken into flakes. One 
pint of cream sauce and one cup cracker crumbs moistened with 
melted butter ; put a layer of fish in a gratin dish, season well 
with salt, pepper, cayenne, and celery salt, and sprinkle with 
chopped parsley, pour over a part of the cream sauce, repeat till 
the fish is all used, reserving most of the sauce to pour over the 
top ; sprinkle buttered crumbs over the top and bake in a rather 
quick oven till it boils up in the middle and the crumbs are brown. 

Codfish a la Mode. — Take one teacup of salt codfish 
picked up fine, two teacups of mashed potatoes, one pint of cream 
or milk. Mix them well together and then add two eggs well 
beaten. Stir them in thoroughly and then add a half cup of 



FISH, ETC, 69 

butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Put in a baking dish and 
bake twenty or thirty minutes. 

Maigre Fish Pie. — Have ready plenty of salt codfish boiled 
and free from bones and skin. Have ready also four hard-boiled 
eggs and four onions. Peel and slice the eggs and onions very 
thin. Line the bottom of a deep pie dish with fish forcemeat or 
a layer of boiled potatoes sliced thin. On this put a layer of 
onions, then a layer of fish, then of eggs, and so on till the dish 
is full. Season each layer with a little pepper, and pour over the 
layers a gill of water containing a teaspoonful of made mustard, a 
teaspoonful of the essence of anchovy, and a little mushroom cat- 
sup. Break in small bits over the top an ounce of fresh butter. 
Cover all with a puff paste and bake an hour. For this dish fresh 
fish may be used by adding a little salt. 

A Norwegian Fish-Pudding. — Take a five or six pound 
haddock, clean, skin, fillet and scrape to a pulp with a knife. 
Pound in a mortar until it is smooth ; add one teaspoonful salt 
and one tablespoonful butter, and continue working for ten 
minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and work in with a potato 
masher two egg yolks blended with one cup of cream, putting it 
in by spoonfuls ; add another cup cream and one-half pepper- 
spoonful allspice. Beat furiously and when it is frothy put in a 
buttered mold and steam for three hours. If desired, the top 
may be browned before serving, but it should be done quickly. 
Serve with cream and caper sauce. It should be fine, smooth 
and firm as blanc mange. Fresh cod may be used instead of 
haddock. Instead of making a pudding the paste may be formed 
into balls the size of an egg, steamed in a close mold or box and 
afterwards fried brown in butter and served either with or without 
sauce, or they may be poached in curry sauce or made very small 
and dropped into a thick fish soup. In frying fish Norwegian 
cooks often dust the pieces with grated cheese and add a little to 
the sauce served with the fish. 

Slices of Cod a la Seville. — Wash and dry one-half pound 
of Carolina rice, fry it in hot olive oil, drain on a sieve, and then 
put it in a stew-pan with some pieces of fresh cod in pieces about 
four inches square, and which have been fried in olive oil and 
drained. Cut a Spanish onion in very thin slices, and also 
fry the slices in oil. Mix them with six ripe tomatoes from 
which the skins and seeds have been removed. Cook the onion

and tomato slowly for five minutes, then pour it over the fish 
and rice. Season with a little cayenne, salt, and lemon juice. 
Moisten with one pint of white broth, place a buttered paper on 
top, cover with the lid of the pan, and place in the oven to bake. 
In about half an hour the fish and rice will be done. Remove 
the pieces of fish and with a wooden spoon stir the rice over the 
fire in order to mix it with the seasoning. Arrange the rice on 
a dish and place the pieces of codfish on it. Garnish with 
tomato sauce or mussel sauce. 

Shredded Cod baked with Cream Sauce. — Boil four or 
five pounds of fresh cod. When cooked, drain and shred in fine 
pieces and set away to cool. Make the following sauce for a 
five-pound piece of fish : Boil one quart of milk with one onion 
and a little finely chopped parsley. Set it aside. Mix one cup 
of butter with enough flour to absorb it. Add this to the milk 
and boil until it is the consistency of custard. Season with a 
dash of cayenne and salt to taste. Put a layer of shredded fish 
in a baking dish, cover with a layer of sauce, then a layer of fish 
and so on until the dish is filled. Have the last layer of cream. 
Cover with fine bread crumbs. Sprinkle with pieces of butter 
and bake in the oven until the top is a nice brown. Small boiled 
potato balls covered with cream sauce should be served with 
this. 

Fish Forcemeat, No. 1. — Take two ounces of fish free

half a lemon, half a teaspoonful of powdered thyme, half a tea- 
spoonful of sweet marjoram, a little ground mace, a little salt and 
white pepper and a well-beaten tgg. This may be made in 
larger or smaller quantities, according to the size and number of 
the fish to be stuffed.

basting often. Serve with drawn butter sauce or Qgg sauce. 

Finnan Haddie. — Soak fish in milk and water to cover, 
using equal parts, one and one-half hours on back of range. 
Drain, separate into flakes and rinse thoroughly in warm water. 
There should be two cupfuls. Cook one-quarter cup butter with

quarter cup flour, one cup each of milk and cream, one-half tea- 
spoonful of paprika, one and one-half teaspoonfuls of salt, and 
when mixture thickens add the flaked fish and one-third cup 
canned red peppers, cut in strips. Cover bottom of dish with 
cooked macaroni, pour over the fish and set in oven for five

and cream. Bring to the boiling point and add finnan haddie. 
Turn into a buttered dish, cover with buttered crumbs and bake 
until the crumbs are brown. 

Finnan Haddies. — To BroiV: First heat broiler and grease 
well to keep from sticking ; then place meat side to the fire and 
cook slowly fifteen minutes ; careful not to burn. Butter and 
pepper to suit taste ; garnish with slices of lemon or parsley. 

To Bake : Place fish in cold water, then place on fire and let 
it come to a boil ; then remove skin and place in a pan with two 
or three slices of fat pork ; bake in a moderate oven twenty-five 
or thirty minutes. 

To Boil : Place fish in boihng water and boil for twenty min- 
utes ; serve with tgg sauce or drawn butter.

Egg Sauce : Chop up two hard boiled eggs and stir into drawn 
butter. 

Fried Catfish. — Catfish must be cooked quite fresh — if 
possible, directly out of the water. The larger ones are gener- 
ally coarse and strong ; the small-sized fish are the best. Wash 
and clean them, cut off their heads and tails, remove the upper 
part of the backbone near the shoulders, and score them along 
the back with deep gashes or incisions. Dredge them with flour, 
and fry them in plenty of lard, boiling fast when the catfish are 
put into the pan. Or you may fry them in the drippings of 
gravy saved from roast beef or veal. They are very nice dipped 
in a batter of beaten egg and grated bread crumbs, or they may 
be done plain, though not in so nice a way, with Indian meal 
instead of bread crumbs. Drain off the lard before you dish 
them. Touch each incision or cut very slightly with a little 
cayenne before they go to table. 



FISH, ETC. 73 

A Salt Codfish Dish. — Remove the skin and cut in 
pieces two and one-half pounds of salt cod. Soak for eighteen 
hours in cold water, changing water two or three times. Drain, 
place fish in a saucepan with cold water to cover it and let cook 
slowly (but not boil) for twenty minutes. Drain and remove all 
bones, place cod in a saucepan ; then squeeze in the juice of a 
lemon and add drop by drop half a gill of olive oil, sharply 
stirring while adding it. Then pour in also, little by little, a 
half gill of cream, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one salt- 
spoonful of cayenne and mix well. Serve on a hot, deep dish 
with slices of toasted bread around. 

Fried Eels, No. 1 . — After skinning, emptying, and wash- 
ing them as clean as possible, cut them into short pieces, and dry 
them well with a soft cloth. Season them with fine salt and 
cayenne, flour them thickly, and fry them in boiling lard ; when 
nicely browned, drain and dry them, and send to the table with 
plain melted butter and a lemon, or with fish sauce. Eels are 
sometimes dipped into batter and then fried, or into egg and 
dried bread crumbs, and served with plenty of crisped parsley. 

Eels Fried in Batter, No. 2. — Cut a large eel weighing 
about two pounds in quite thick slices. See that it is clean. 
Place in a basin with a little salt and pepper and some vinegar. 
Let the pieces soak for several hours. They must be turned 
occasionally. Drain thoroughly, then dip in batter and fry in 
hot fat. When a nice brown, drain on paper and serve very hot 
with a brown or tomato sauce. 

Baked Eels. — Prepare as for frying ; then put into a 
baking pan with a litde water, flour, pepper, and salt. Bake 
twenty minutes. Make a gravy of the liquor in which they were 
baked, adding a little butter. 

Baked Eels with Tartare Sauce. — Skin two fat eels, each 
weighing about one and a half pounds. Cut off the fins, heads, 
and tails. Clean them thoroughly and tie them together so as to 
shape them on a round platter. Wrap them in a wet cloth and 
cook slowly in court bouillon for fifteen minutes. Set aside and 
let them cool in the liquor. Season about one pint of fine bread 
crumbs with one teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper. 
Carefully remove the cloth from the fish, wipe dry, and cover 
them with the bread crumbs. Then spread them with a mixture 



74 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

of two well-beaten eggs and one tablespoonful of olive oil. 
Sprinkle once more with bread crumbs. Place them in a baking 
pan, being particular to keep the circular shape. Add two and a 
half tablespoonfuls of butter. Bake in moderate oven for half an 
hour. Baste them three times. Place on a circular dish. In 
the centre place green peppers filled with tartare sauce after you 
have removed the core and seeds from peppers, soaked them in 
cold water, drained thoroughly, and then filled them with the 
sauce. 

Frog Legs. — The green marsh frogs furnish the best hams, 
as they are more tender and have less of the strong muddy 
flavor. They are generally liked fried. Pare off the feet and 
truss them by inserting the stump along the shin of the other leg.

then drain and roll in flour, then in beaten egg, and in fiine bread 
crumbs. Fry to a light brown in hot fat. Serve with fried 
parsley. 

Frog Legs a la Mariniere. — Saute three dozen legs with 
two ounces of butter, one-half pint chopped mushrooms, four 
shallots. As soon as well-colored add a tablespoonful flour, a 
little salt, pepper, and cayenne, and moisten with a half pint of 
white wine and enough consomme to nearly cover. Boil ten 
minutes. Mix the yolks of four eggs with two tablespoonfuls 
cream and stir it into the boiling mixture. Remove at once from 
the fire and serve. 

Stewed Frogs a la Poulette. — Trim, truss, and marinate 
as for frying. Cook in a sautoir with two tablespoonfuls butter, 
salt, pepper, and speck of nutmeg. Cook briskly and long 
enough to evaporate the water without allowing them to burn. 
Add two glasses white wine, a pint of velvet sauce ; cover and 
boil till quite tender. Skim, add a liaison of four Qgg yolks, one 
tablespoonful chopped parsley, the juice of a lemon and two 
ounces of butter. Mix well and serve with fried croutons. 

Baked Cod or Halibut. — Use a piece of fish from the 
middle of the back weighing four, five, or six pounds. Lay the 
fish in very cold salt-and-water for two hours ; wipe dry ; make 
deep gashes in both sides at right angles with the backbone, and 
rub into these, as well as coat it all over with, a forcemeat made 
of crumbs, pork, herbs, onion, and seasoning, made to adhere by

raw egg. Lay in the baking pan and pour over it the drawn 
butter (which should be quite thin), season with the anchovy 
sauce, lemon juice, pepper, and a pinch of parsley. Bake in a 
moderate oven nearly an hour, or even more if the piece be 
large — basting frequently lest it should brown too fast. Add 
a little butter-and-water when the sauce thickens too much. 
When the fish is done, remove to a hot dish, and strain the gravy 
over it. A few capers or chopped green pickles are a pleasant 
addition to the gravy. 

Baked Halibut, No. 1. — Arrange six thin slices of fat salt 
pork (about two and one-half inches square) in a baking pan. 
Wipe a two-pound (or as much as you happen to have) piece of 
halibut with a damp cloth and place it in the pan. Mask the 
fish with three tablespoonfuls of butter creamed and mixed with 
three tablespoonfuls of flour; then cover the top with three- 
quarters of a cupful of buttered cracker crumbs and arrange five 
thin strips of fat salt pork over the crumbs. Cover with buttered 
paper and bake fifty minutes in a moderate oven, removing the 
paper during the last fifteen minutes to brown the crumbs and 
pork. Garnish with thin slices of lemon (cut in fancy shapes if 
desired) then sprinkle with finely chopped parsley. Serve with 
the following sauce : Melt three tablespoonfuls of butter, add 
three tablespoonfuls of flour ; stir until well blended, then pour on 
gradually, while stirring constantly, one and one-half cups of hot 
water. Bring to the boiling point ; add three tablespoonfuls of 
butter and season with one-half teaspoonful of salt and one-eighth 
teaspoonful of pepper. 

Baked Halibut, No. 2. — Cut about two pounds of halibut 
into pieces two inches square, clean and wipe dry and put in a 
dish with four wineglassfuls of Sherry wine, turning them from 
time to time and let remain in the wine two hours. Then put 
the pieces of fish into a baking pan, moisten well with melted 
butter, sprinkle lightly with bread crumbs and let bake until done 
and nicely browned. Take up the fish and pour into pan in 
which it was baked half a pint of cream. Heat on top of stove, 
thicken with a little flour, pour over fish and send to table gar- 
nished with parsley. Or if preferred melt a little more butter in 
pan, add a little lemon juice to it and pour over fish. If the 
wine is not objectionable you will find this delicious and half the 
portion sufficient for two.

Boiled Halibut. — Take a small halibut, or what you require 
from a large fish. Put it into the fish kettle, with the back of the 
fish undermost ; cover it with cold water, in which a handful of 
salt and a bit of saltpetre the size of a hazel-nut have been dis- 
solved. When it begins to boil skim it carefully, and then let it 
just simmer till it is done. Four pounds of fish will require half

parsley and slices of lemon. The slices of halibut should be 
about an inch thick and for every pound there should be three 
tablespoonfuls of butter. 

Broiled Halibut, No. 2. — Slices of halibut, salt, pepper, 
butter. Cut the slices of fish about an inch thick, season with

towel, and dusting cracker meal on both sides. Lay them in 
smoking hot salad oil, and they will be well cooked and of a 
pale brown in three or five minutes, according to thickness of 
the slices.

a slice of halibut, brush over with melted butter, and sprinkle 
with salt, pepper, and onion juice. Put in baking pan, cover 
with paper, and bake fifteen minutes. Serve with Hollandaise 
sauce. 

Hollandaise Sauce : Put one-half tablespoonful vinegar and 
the yolks of two eggs in a saucepan ; set in a larger pan of boil- 
ing water. Stir quickly with a wire spoon, adding gradually 
three-quarters cupful butter (the salt having been removed by 
washing). When sauce is thickened, remove from the fire, and 
add a few grains cayenne and salt. 

Halibut Cutlets. — Cut your halibut steaks an inch thick, 
wipe them with a dry cloth, and season with salt and cayenne 
pepper. Have ready a pan of yolk of eggs well beaten and a 
dish of grated bread crumbs. Put some fresh lard or beef drip- 
pings in a frying-pan and hold it over the fire till it boils. Dip 
your cutlets in the egg, and then in the bread crumbs. Fry a 
light brown ; serve up hot. Salmon or any large fish may be 
fried in the same manner.

crumbs of four crackers, add lastly the halibut ; let it cook five 
minutes, then add two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, and serve 
on a hot platter with bits of buttered toast. 

Halibut Salad. — Steam a slice of halibut, first well rubbed 
over with salt, until the flesh easily separates from the bone ; 
remove skin and bone and with a fork separate it into flakes into 
attractive pieces, not mincing it too fine to have a leftover 
appearance, add a seasoning of salt, and French dressing to 
which has been added a few gratings of raw onion. When ready 
to serve pour off what French dressing has not been absorbed 
and arrange in a salad dish with alternate layers of fish, cold 
boiled peas, cucumbers cut in cubes and sprinkled with salt and 
salad cream. Garnish with heart leaves of lettuce and serve 
with any kind of sweet pickle or with spiced gooseberry. 

Halibut Salad with Cucumber Spirals. — Halibut salad 
is an appetizing, warm weather dish for luncheon or Sunday 
night's supper. Steam a slice of halibut three inches thick. Its 
flavor is improved if a soup bunch is thrown into the steamer 
with it. It is done when tender enough to remove the skin and 
bone, which should be accomplished while it is still hot without 
disturbing the shape. Pour over it a French dressing made of 
four tablespoonfuls of olive oil, two of vinegar, with salt and 
pepper to taste. When cold, arrange on a bed of lettuce hearts 
and fill the cavity from which the bone was taken with the 
best of them. 

The dish is prettily garnished with curls, spirals, or cups of 
cucumber, made as follows : Cut a cucumber crosswise in sec- 
tions three-quarters of an inch thick. Cut each section round and 
round in one long, thin paring. Mayonnaise dressing fills these 
cups, or is served with the fish in a separate sauce cup if the 
cucumbers are served in the usual way, that is, sliced with a 
French dressing. 

Herring Salad. — Soak over night three Holland herrings, 
cut in small pieces. Cook and peel eight medium potatoes and 
when cold chop with two small cooked red beets, two onions, a 
few sour apples, some roasted veal, three hard-boiled eggs ; mix 
with a sauce of sweet-oil, vinegar, stock, pepper and mustard to 
taste. A tablespoonful of thick, sour cream is an improvement 
to the sauce, which should stand over night in an earthen dish. 



FISH, ETC. 79 

Fresh Mackerel Boiled. — If not cleaned, open them at 
the gills, take out the insides, wash clean, and pin in a fish-cloth. 
(Do not use the cloth that you use to boil mackerel for any other 
fish.) Drop into boiling water, and boil fifteen minutes. Serve 
with drawn butter. 

Broiled Mackerel. — Split down the back and clean. Be 
careful to scrape all the thin black skin from the inside. Wipe 
dry and lay on the gridiron ; broil on one side a nice brown, then 
turn and brown the other side ; it will not take so long to brown 
the side on which the skin is. (All fish should have the side on 
which the skin is turned to the fire last, as the skin burns easily 
and coals are not so hot after you have used them ten minutes.) 
Season with butter, pepper and salt. 

Fried Mackerel. — Fry brown six good-sized slices of pork. 
Prepare your mackerel as for broiling. Take out your pork, 
sprinkle a little salt over the mackerel, then fry a nice brown. 
Serve the fried pork with it. 

Baked Mackerel, No. 1. — Prepare as for boiling. Make 
a dressing as for baked cod. Stuff with this, dredge with salt and 
flour. Bake thirty minutes, basting often with water, butter and 
flour. Make a gravy with the water in the pan in which the 
fish is baked. Always make the gravy quite salt. The best way 
to cook mackerel is to broil it. 

Baked Mackerel, No. 2. — -Split and clean two small 
mackerel. Place in a buttered dripping pan, sprinkle with salt 
and pepper, and pour over one-half cupful thin cream. Bake in 
hot oven twenty minutes. 

Baked Mackerel, No. 3. — Split fish, clean and remove 
head and tail. Put in buttered dripping pan and sprinkle with 
salt and pepper and dot over with butter (allowing one table- 
spoonful to a medium-sized fish), and pour over two-thirds cup 
milk. Bake twenty-five minutes in hot oven. 

Salt Mackerel. — Soak salt mackerel about forty-eight 
hours, changing the water once, then put it in a pan, cover with 
cream or the richest milk. Put in the oven and cook until cream 
is brown.

of butter. This is a nice dish for breakfast and dinner. 

Broiled Salt Mackerel. — Freshen by soaking it over- 
night in water, taking care that the skin lies uppermost. In the 
morning dry it without breaking, cut off the head and tip of the 
tail, place it between the bars of a buttered fish-gridiron, and 
broil to a light brown ; lay it on a hot dish, and dress with a 
little butter, pepper, and lemon juice, vinegar, or chopped pickle. 

Planked Fish. — Purchase a wooden plank one and one- 
half by one foot. Butter the plank quite freely, then lay on 
slices of cod, halibut, or whole fish, cover with thin strips of 
pork, then put in roasting pan and bake. When done, make 
pyramids of mashed potatoes around it, return to oven and 
brown. Put plank on large platter and serve. Garnish with thin 
slices of tomatoes. 

Fried Perch. — Scale and clean them perfectly ; dry them 
well, flour and fry them in boiling lard. Serve plenty of fried 
parsley round them. 

Fish or Meat Ramekins. — A delicious luncheon dish or 
an entree for dinner may be made from leftover fish or meat. 
Cut the meat or fish very fine, but do not grind it. Add a well- 
beaten egg, a little milk and a few bread crumbs. Season well 
with salt and pepper. Put a piece of butter the size of a walnut 
in each ramekin and then add the mixture and bake until brown. 

Boiled Rockfish. — After the fish has been nicely cleaned, 
put it into a pot with water enough to cover it, and throw in salt 
in the proportion of half a teaspoonful to a pound of fish. Boil 
it slowly until the meat is tender and easily separates from the

and bake until the crumbs are brown in a hot oven. 

Scalloped Fish, No. 2. — Skin and cut into small pieces a 
cod or haddock, and lay in a deep earthen dish. Dredge in 
about half a cup of flour, one spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful 
of pepper. Cut about two spoonfuls of butter into small pieces 
and strew in ; cover the whole with new milk and bake forty 
minutes. 

Stewed Fish with Oysters. — Cut the fish in pieces for 
serving, remove the skin and bone. Spread a thick coating of 
butter over the bottom of the stew-pan, lay in the fish, season 
each layer with sak and pepper, pour on boiling water to more 
than cover, add a tablespoonful of lemon juice or vinegar and 
simmer fifteen or twenty minutes, or till the fish is cooked but 
not broken. Add a tablespoonful of flour cooked in a tablespoon- 
ful of hot butter, mix it well with the boiling liquid without break- 
mg the fish. Add a quart of oysters, or enough to equal the 
fish. Simmer until the oysters are plump. Add more seasoning

sharp vinegar and boil ten minutes ; pour it over one pint of cold 
flaked fish. 

Broiled Scrod. — Scrod is one of two famous Boston importa- 
tions ; the other is broiled lobster. Scrod is young cod, and one 
may weigh from two and a half to five pounds ; the best weigh 
four or five pounds. When thoroughly broiled it should be rich, 
flaky, and delicious. Rub the gridiron with fat pork and broil 
the inside of the fish first. Twenty minutes is usually sufficient 
to broil a fish of ordinary size. Serve with warmed butter, 
pepper, and salt. 

Baked Salmon with Cream Sauce. — Butter a sheet of 
foolscap paper on both sides, and wrap the fish up in it, pinning 
the ends securely together. Lay in the baking pan, and pour six 
or seven spoonfuls of butter-and-water over it. Turn another pan 
over all, and steam in a moderate oven from three-quarters of an 
hour to an hour, lifting the cover, from time to time, to baste and 
assure yourself that the paper is not burning. Meanwhile, have 
ready in a saucepan a cup of cream, in which you would do well 
to dissolve a bit of soda a little larger than a pea. This is a wise 
precaution whenever cream is to be boiled. Heat this in a vessel 
placed within another of hot water ; thicken with a heaping tea- 
spoonful of corn-starch ; add a tablespoonful of butter, pepper, 
and salt to taste, a liberal pinch of minced parsley, and when the 
fish is unwrapped and dished, pour half the dressing slowly over 
it, sending the rest to table in a boat. If you have no cream use 
milk, and add a beaten egg to the thickening. 

Baked Salmon, No. 1. — Clean the fish, rinse it, wipe it dry ; 
rub it well outside and in with a mixture of pepper and salt, and fill 
it with a stuffing made of slices of bread, buttered freely and moist- 
ened with hot milk or water (add sage or thyme to the season- 
ing if liked) : tie a thread around the fish, so as to keep the 
stuffing in (take off" the thread before serving) ; lay muffin rings, 
or a trivet in a dripping pan, lay bits of butter over the fish, 
dredge flour over, and put it on the rings, put a pint of hot water 
in the pan to baste with ; bake one hour, if a large fish, in a quick 
oven ; baste frequently. When the fish is taken up, having cut a 
lemon in very thin slices, put them in the pan, and burn it. 

Baked Salmon, No. 2. — Take four salmon steaks weighing 
one pound each. Place in a buttered saucepan with one pint white 



FISH, ETC. 83 

wine, one pint white broth, white pepper, salt, a little grated nut- 
meg, a bunch of parsley with a few whole spices or herbs wrapped 
in it, and two ounces of butter. Let it come to a boil, then cover 
and simmer for one-half hour. Drain the fish and remove the 
bunch of parsley. Thicken the liquid with one ounce of flour 
which has been cooked in butter. Boil ten minutes, then mix 
with the yolks of four eggs and some chopped parsley. Spread a 
thin layer of thick mashed potatoes in an oval baking dish, well 
buttered. Remove the bone and skin from the steaks and place 
them one overlapping the other on the potatoes. Fill with more 
potatoes, smooth nicely, and pour the sauce over all. Sprinkle 
with bread crumbs and little pieces of butter over the top. Bake 
until a light brown, in a moderate oven, about twenty minutes. 
Serve in the baking dish. 

Boiled Salmon. — A piece weighing six pounds should be 
rubbed with salt, tied carefully in a cloth, and boiled slowly for 
three-quarters of an hour. It should be eaten with egg or caper 
sauce. If any remain after dinner it may be placed in a deep 
dish, a little salt sprinkled over, and a teacupful of boiling vinegar 
poured over it. Cover it closely and it will make a nice break- 
fast dish. 

Salmon, Boiled Plain. — Have ready a fish kettle with 
enough boiling soft water to cover the fish ; wash off the water 
from the fish and let it come rather slowly to the boil again. 
Simmer very gently till done, allowing about fifteen minutes to 
each pound. Throw in one tablespoonful salt just before it is 
done. Serve with plain drawn butter sauce. 

Broiled Salmon, No. 1 . — Select as many slices of salmon as 
required. Sprinkle with a little chopped parsley and mixed herbs, 
salt and pepper, and some olive oil. Let the slices soak for one 
hour, turning occasionally so the fish will absorb the seasoning. 
Arrange on a well-greased gridiron and broil over a clear fire. 
Baste occasionally with the oil seasoning which is left. When 
nicely browned and thoroughly cooked, place on a hot dish, and 
garnish with parsley and slices of lemon. Serve a white sauce in 
a separate dish. 

Broiled Salmon, No. 2. — The steaks from the centre of the 
fish are best. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, spread on a little 
butter, and broil over a clear but slow fire.

salmon in very small pieces. Mix some boiled lobster coral and 
half an ounce of butter, pound in a mortar, and rub through a 
hair sieve. Place one gill of milk in a saucepan with one ounce 
of butter and one ounce of flour which have been creamed 
together. Stir over the fire until it becomes thick and does not 
stick to the sides of the pan. Then stir in the salmon, coral, a 
dash of cayenne pepper, salt, and lemon juice to taste. Remove 
from the fire. When cold, shape the mixture into cutlets, brush

white pepper, and a little lemon juice, and place the larded side 
up in a buttered pan. Moisten with half a pint of white wine, 
and cover with a sheet of buttered paper with a small hole in the 
centre. The steam must have vent, else the surface will not 
glaze. Cook in the oven about forty minutes, basting frequently 
with the liquid in order to have the glaze a nice color. Drain 
and dish the fillets in a circle with alternate heart-shaped slices 
of bread fried m butter. Thicken two ladlefuls of broth with an 
ounce of flour kneaded in butter. Stir and boil a few minutes.

cold, add it to the fish. Rub all well together and put on ice for 
half an hour. Then add half a pint of whipped cream. Butter 
your mold, decorate it with truffles. Put on ice to harden, so 
the decoration will be firm on mold. Fill the mold with fish, 
giving it a few knocks on the table to settle the forcemeat. 
Thirty minutes before serving put your mold in a pan, pour hot 
water halfway to mold, put a buttered paper on top, and poach 
in a moderate oven until firm to the touch. When ready to 
serve, dip your mold in cold water, lay the dish you are going 
to serve it in on top of mold. Turn very gently and lift off the 
mold. Serve with Martinot sauce in centre or in sauce-boat. 

Salmon or Meat Omelet. — A very little left-over salmon

and a little Worcestershire sauce. Mix all into a paste with 
melted butter. Make a highly seasoned French dressing of 
vinegar, oil, pepper and salt, and pour over cucumbers which 
have been peeled and sliced very thin. Then set them on the ice 
for fifteen or twenty minutes. Evenly spread two thin slices of 
unbuttered bread with the salmon mixture. Put a slice of cucum- 
ber between them and shape sandwich according to the general 
rule. You may prepare your bread spread with salmon one-half 
or three-quarters of an hour before serving, but the cucumbers 
should be added at the last moment. Canned salmon may be 
used. If it is, use the butter sparingly. 

Smoked Salmon, Broiled. — Take a half pound of smoked 
salmon and parboil it ten minutes ; lay in cold water for the 
same length of time ; wipe dry and broil over a clear fire. Add

hot plate, and serve with dry toast. 

Pickled Salmon. — Soak salt salmon twenty-four hours, 
changing the water frequently; afterward pour boiling water 
around it, and let it stand fifteen minutes ; drain off and then 
pour on boiling vinegar with cloves and mace added. 

To Cook Salt Codfish. — The fish should be thoroughly 
washed and soaked in cold water twelve hours. Change the 
water and put on to cook. As soon as the water comes to a 
boiling point, set back where it will keep hot, but will not boil. 
From four to six hours will cook a very dry, hard fish, and there 
are kinds which will cook in half an hour. If it has hung in a 
furnace heated cellar till hard, it will never come tender. It 
is best not to buy more than will be used in a week or two. 
Like ham, bacon and meat in general, it should be hung, not laid 
on a shelf. 

Soaking Salt Fish. — Very salt fish should be soaked several 
hours in three or four changes of warm water. Place the skin 
side up, so that salt crystals may fall away from the under or 
meat side. Wipe carefully and clean, then soak for an hour in 
very cold water. 

Salt Fish Dinner. — Soak a pound of salt fish in cold 
water. When time comes put your potatoes on to boil for 
dinner. Peel them first. Cut up one pound salt mixed pork in 
tiny squares and fry a nice brown. When potatoes are about 
half done put on your salt fish and cover with water. Boil fifteen 
minutes. Drain fish and put on platter. Put the pork scraps in 
a gravy boat and potatoes in a covered dish. Mix your potato 
and fish together on your plate at dinner and have the pork 
scraps for gravy. Serve with tomato sauce, johnnycake, and 
pickles. 

Broiled Salt Fish. — Cut a square the size you desire from 
the thickest part of the fish. Take off the skm, and wash clean ; 
broil over clear coals ten minutes, then dip in boiling water, 
butter and serve. This is a nice relish for breakfast or tea, and 
with boiled potatoes makes an excellent dinner.

Creamed Salt Codfish. — Garnished with Hard-boiled 
Eggs. — Pick in small pieces one cup salt codfish ; cover with 
lukewarm water and let stand on back of range until softened. 
Melt one tablespoonful butter, add one tablespoonful flour, and 
pour on gradually one cup hot milk. Add fish, and turn on a hot 
platter. Garnish with slices of hard-boiled eggs. Serve with 
baked potatoes. 

Salt Fish in Cream. — Tear a piece of fish into small 
strips, wash clean, and place it in a basin with about a quart of 
water; let it simmer half an hour. Then pour off the water, and 
add one pint of new milk. When this comes to a boil, thicken 
with one spoonful of flour, let it boil five minutes, then add butter 
the size of a walnut and a little pepper, and serve. 

Cleaning a Shad. — Scale and scrape it carefully ; split it 
down the back and remove the contents, reserving the roe or 
melt. Wash well and cook as desired. 

Planked Shad, No. 1 . — Have a hardwood board about 
one inch and a half thick. Split the shad as for broiling, tack it 
on the board, skin side down, and roast before the fire until done. 
Every once in a while rub it with a little butter. Before placing 
the shad on the board, see that the board is well seasoned and 
heated, else the fish will have the flavor of the wood. When 
cooked, place in a hot dish, season with salt and pepper, cover 
with small bits of butter, and serve with lemon cut in quarters. 

Planked Shad, No. 2. — Split and clean a small shad. 
Put skin-side down on an oak plank, one inch thick. Sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and brush over with melted butter. Bake 
twenty-five minutes in a hot oven. Spread with butter, and 
garnish with lemon cut in fancy shapes and parsley. Send to 
table on plank. 

Broiled Shad. — Scrape, split, wash, and dry the shad on a 
cloth ; season with pepper and salt ; grease the gridiron well ; as 
soon as it is hot lay the shad on to broil with the inside down- 
ward. One side being well browned, turn it. It should broil a 
quarter of an hour or more, according to the thickness. Butter 
well and send to table hot. 



FISH, ETC. 89 

Broiled Shad a PAbbe with Herb Sauce. — Get one 

large roe shad and an extra shad roe. Prepare the fish for broil- 
ing, taking the roe and keeping it with the other until wanted. 
Remove the bone of the fish, clean nicely, wash and wipe dry. 
Make small incisions on both sides of the fish and soak it for one 
hour in a dish with salt, pepper, olive oil, and lemon juice. See 
that it soaks on both sides. Drain, sprinkle with bread crumbs, 
and broil slowly for one-half hour. See that your broiler is well 
greased. Make eight pieces out of your roe and also have eight 
large oysters. Dip them in beaten egg and roll in bread crumbs 
and fry in hot fat until a nice brown. Dish up the shad, surround 
with roes and oysters, and serve with an herb sauce. 

Baked Shad. — Many people are of the opinion that the 
very best method of cooking a shad is to bake it. Stuff it with 
bread crumbs, salt, pepper, butter, and parsley, and mix this up 
with beaten yolk of egg ; fill the fish with it, and sew it up or 
fasten a string around it. Pour over it a little water and some 
butter, and bake as you would a fowl. A shad will require from 
an hour to an hour and a quarter to bake. 

Roast Shad with Sauce. — Have a large roe shad, scale, 
draw by the gills, cleanse nicely, and wipe dry. Make small 
crosswise incisions on both sides. Put the fish on a dish to soak 
for one hour with salt, pepper, olive oil, lemon juice, chopped 
parsley, chives, and thyme. Be sure to turn and press it often 
so it will absorb the seasoning. Put on the spit or on a long 
skewer, if to roast in the oven, wrap in double oiled paper, mak- 
ing it secure by pressing down a shorter skewer along each side 
and tying at each end. Then roast before the fire, or in a 
moderate oven for forty minutes. Remove the paper, brown a 
nice color. Place on dish, pour sauce round it, and serve. 

Baked Shad Roe. — Pare the roes of four large shad, 
sprinkle a baking dish with chopped onions, parsley, and mush- 
rooms. Add the roes, strew over them more onion, etc., with 
salt, pepper, a little nutmeg, and small bits of butter. Moisten 
with a little white broth and two glasses of white wine. Let all 
cook and boil in the oven, basting occasionally, for twenty 
minutes. Drain and thicken the liquid with one tablespoonful of 
flour kneaded in butter. Pour this over the roes, sprinkle with 
fine bread crumbs, put small bits of butter on top, and bake in

brisk oven ten minutes longer. Press lemon juice over and serve 
in the baking dish. The above is enough for eight persons. 

Shad Roe Cromeskies. — Wash thoroughly in cold water 
the roe of a shad and remove the skin hanging to it. Wipe it 
well and cut it in pieces of a size to wrap well in thin slices of 
bacon. Rub the pieces of shad with salt and pepper. Lay them 
in the slices of bacon, wrap the bacon round, and tie with fine 
twine. Have care that the bacon is not too thick. Drop each 
piece in deep hot fat and fry a light brown. Garnish with parsley 
and serve with a piquant sauce. 

Pickled Shad or Bluefish. — Put the fish on the drainer or 
sheet in the kettle, add one tablespoonful of salt for each quart 
of water and enough boiling water to just cover the fish ; cook 
slowly until the flesh separates from the bone, thirty minutes or 
less. Drain and let cool. Cut the flesh in pieces. To half the 
water in which the fish was cooked add pickling spice, a table- 
spoonful to a quart, and simmer half an hour or more. Add as 
much cider vinegar as liquor, and heat and pour over the fish, 
taking care that the liquor covers the contents. The pickle will 
be ready for use in one or two days and will keep in a cool place 
about ten days. 

Smelts. — The only way to cook smelts is to fry them, 
although they are sometimes baked. Open them at the gills. 
Draw each smelt separately between your finger and thumb, 
beginning at the tail ; this will press the insides out. (Some 
persons never take out the insides, but it should be done as much 
as in any other fish.) Wash them clean, and let them drain 
in a colander ; then salt and roll in a mixture half flour and 
half Indian meal. Have about two inches deep of boiling fat in 
the frying-pan (drippings if you have them ; if not lard) ; into 
this drop the smelts, and fry brown. Do not put so many in 
that they will be crowded ; if you do, they will not be crisp and 
brown. 

Smelts as a Garnish. — Smelts fried plain or rolled in 
meal or flour and then fried are often used to garnish other 
kinds of fish. With baked fish they are arranged around the dish 
in any form that the taste of the cook may dictate ; but in 
garnishing fish or any other dish, the arrangement should always 
be simple, so as not to make the matter of serving any harder 



FISH, ETC. 91 

than if the dish were not garnished. Smelts are also seasoned 
well with salt and pepper, dipped in butter and afterwards in 
flour and placed in a very hot oven for eight or ten minutes to 
get a handsome brown. They are then served as a garnish, or 
on slices of buttered toast. When smelts are used as a garnish, 
serve one on each plate with the other fish. If you wish to have 
the smelts in rings for a garnish, fasten the tails in the opening 
at the gills with little wooden toothpicks ; then dip them in the 
beaten tgg and in the crumbs, place in the frying basket and 
plunge in the boiling fat. When they are cooked take out the 
skewers and they will retain their shape. 

Baked Smelts. — Line a well-buttered flat baking dish with 
forcemeat and arrange the smelts on it. Sprinkle with finely 
chopped parsley and mushrooms, season with salt, pepper, and a 
little grated nutmeg. Cover with veloute sauce, which has one 
glass of white wine mixed with it. Then sprinkle with bread 
crumbs, and pieces of butter, and bake in hot oven for twenty 
minutes. When cooked sprinkle with the juice of a lemon and 
serve in the baking dish. 

Broiled Smelts. — Split and clean as many smelts as are 
required. Select large ones. Remove the backbone, rub each 
one with olive oil, and season with a little salt and pepper. Grease 
the broiler, arrange the smelts on it, and broil on each side for two 
or three minutes. Serve with a B^arnaise sauce. 

Smelt Croquettes. — Select as many medium- sized fresh 
smelts as you desire to serve. Clean and prepare them as you 
would for broiling, removing backbone, dry them, and set in cool 
place. Boil one pound of halibut, pound it fine, then add a little 
Sherry, white pepper and salt to taste. Beat in enough cream 
sauce to enable you to form the mixture into small croquettes. 
Roll a smelt around each one, fastening it by sticking the head 
through the tail. Roll in beaten egg and fine bread crumbs and 
fry in hot lard. Drain on thick brown paper. Arrange a lemon 
basket in the centre of a dish, around it place the smelts and 
garnish border with half of the whites of hard-boiled eggs, each 
filled with tartare sauce. 

Fried Smelts a la Parisienne. — Wash the smelts thor- 
oughly, cut down the back, and take the bone out a little below 
the head and just above the tail. Clean well and cut away the 



92 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD, 

fins and gills. Dry well and flour them. Roll them up by putting 
their tails in their mouths and fastening them with a little wooden 
skewer. Set away in the ice-box. Have your oil or fat very hot. 
Fry a few at a time, then let your oil get very hot. Put all in 
your frying basket, plunge into your hot fat. They will swell up 
and be a beautiful brown and crisp. Boil the number of eggs 
required, allowing one-half for each person. Take out the yolks 
and put the whites in cold water. Make a tartare sauce. When 
ready to ser\^e, fill each half egg with tartare sauce and put round 
the fish. Put a bunch of parsley between each egg. Serve the 
fish very hot. 

Sauted Smelts. — Clean and wipe nine selected smelts. 
Cut five parallel gashes on both sides of each fish. Sprinkle with 
salt, pepper, and lemon juice ; cover and let stand fifteen minutes. 
Dip in cream, dredge with flour, and saut6 in butter until deli- 
cately browned, taking care that butter in pan does not burn. 
Pour around smelts a sauce made from butter in pan : one table- 
spoonful flour, and one cup of chicken stock, and seasoned with 
salt, pepper, and lemon juice. 

Stuffed Smelts. — Remove the fins from two dozen large 
smelts. Clean them without splitting them and stuff with a fish 
forcemeat — a paper cornucopia must be used. Place the fish 
on a well-buttered dish, cover them with one pint of Italienne 
sauce, and bake in a hot oven for ten minutes. Squeeze some 
lemon juice over them and serve in the same dish. 

Baked Sardines, No. 1. — Remove the skin from twelve 
large sardines. Put them on a dish and heat them through. 
Put the oil from the sardines in a saucepan, and when it comes 
to a boil stir in one cup of water, then add one teaspoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper to taste. Remove from 
the fire, and stir in the beaten yolk of an egg, one teaspoonful of 
vinegar, and one of mustard. Serve the fish very hot, with 
this sauce poured over them or in a separate dish. 

Baked Sardines, No. 2. — To one small can of sardines 
allow two tablespoonfuls of butter, four tablespoonfuls of bread 
crumbs and one small onion, finely minced, and two eggs, salt 
and pepper to taste ; wipe all the oil from the sardines, divide 
them into halves and lay in a baking dish ; melt half the butter, 
pour it over them and add two tablespoonfuls of hot water ; beat

up the eggs and gradually mix them into the bread crumbs, 
onion, salt and pepper and remainder of the butter; spread this 
mixture over the sardines and bake fifteen minutes. 

Sardines au Gratin. — Heat a tablespoonful of oil in an 
earthen baking dish, add one exceedingly fine chopped onion 
and gently brown five minutes, frequently stirring meanwhile, 
Wipe neatly and split open through front twelve good-sized sar- 
dines in oil, bone them, arrange them in dish over the onions. 
Knead in a bowl one ounce fresh butter, one-half teaspoonful 
fresh chopped parsley, two tablespoonfuls fresh bread crumbs and 
one-half a bean finely chopped garhc. Divide mixture in small 
bits over sardines, set in a very brisk oven for six minutes, 
remove and immediately send to the table in same dish. 

Sardine Salad. — Cover a large plate with lettuce leaves, 
letting them come over the edge of the dish. Take any kind of 
boiled white fish that has been " left over " and pick into small 
pieces, covering the lettuce, leaving a narrow margin ; split six 
sardines, taking out the bone and lay them on the fish, the heads 
in the centre, and spread around to form a disk ; put a little 
parsley in the middle of the dish, at the heads and on the fish, 
between each sardine put a generous teaspoonful of mayonnaise, 
slice a lemon and cut each slice in half and garnish the edge of 
the fish, the rind lying on lettuce. 

Sardine Sandwiches. — Take as many boneless sardines as 
are required, open each one lengthwise, being careful not to 
break them, and place the halves on a fine wire broiler. When 
they have broiled a little on each side, set them away to cool. 
When cold, squeeze a little lemon juice over them, and cut off 
the tails. If fresh butter is used on the bread, sprinkle a little 
salt over the sardines while they are hot. Allow two halves to a 
triangle of bread, and make according to directions. Ordinary 
canned sardines may be used without broiling, but they are apt 
to be very oily. 

Fillet of Sole, No. 1. — Cut off" the head and tail of a large 
flounder and set away for future use. Cut off" the fillets from the 
fish and bake them in the oven for ten minutes and set them 
away to cool. Then make a puree of mushrooms in the follow- 
ing way : Peel and chop fine one pound of mushrooms, melt one 
ounce of butter, add one ounce of flour, and let them come to a

boil. Then stir in one-half cup of consomme, half a cup of 
cream, and the mushrooms and boil for five minutes. Then set 
the mixture away to cool. Make a forcemeat of halibut or any 
kind of fish desired. Now lay the fish fillets on a platter, cover 
each one with the mushroom puree, and then with the forcemeat. 
Put the head and tail in place. Set the platter in a pan of hot 
water and bake in a moderate oven for ten minutes. Remove 
carefully to a platter, garnish with parsley, and serve with Hol- 
landaise sauce. 

Fillet of Sole, No. 2. — Take two soles, divide them from 
the backbone, remove the heads, fins, and tails. Sprinkle the 
inside with pepper, salt, and the juice of half a lemon. Roll in 
the shape of a corkscrew, then roll them in egg, then fresh bread 
crumbs, then in tgg, and bread crumbs again. Fry in hot fat 
and serve on a napkin. Garnish with lemon baskets filled with 
tartare sauce and sprigs of parsley. 

Chartreuse of Fish a la Hauraise. — Take some nice 
fillets of sole, put them on a buttered baking tin. Season them 
with salt, pepper, and a little lemon juice. Cover them with a 
thick buttered paper and cook them in a moderate oven for six 
or eight minutes. Then take up the fillets and put them to press 
until cold. Cut them out with a plain round cutter, ornament 
half of them with coral (lobster's), and the other half with tarra- 
gon and parsley and truffle. Set the garnish with a little liquid 
aspic jelly. Line the chartreuse mold with aspic jelly and 
arrange the rounds of sole all over the mold. Set this with 
aspic, just enough to make the garnish firm, and in the centre 
place the following mixture : 

Take about half a pint of picked shrimps or lobsters, cut in 
dice shapes, two peeled tomatoes, four artichoke bottoms (cooked 
and cold), and twelve raw oysters. Add seasoning and red pep- 
per and trimmings of sole. Mix all with half pint of liquid 
aspic jelly and two large tablespoonfuls of thick mayonnaise 
sauce. Stir all together on ice till it begins to set, then pour into 
the mold as directed. Let it stand an hour or more, turn out 
on stand, and garnish with jelly. 

Sole Normande, with Sauce. — Butter a tin very quickly. 
Boil some onions in water to remove the strong flavor, then slice 
them very thin and lay them on the butter. Place the sole on 
them. Put over it salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste, also some

chopped parsley. Add the juice of one lemon and as much 
white wine as will cover it. Place them in a slow oven for thirty 
minutes. Baste the sole with its own liquor very often, and add 
more butter if required. Serve with fried bread sippets and a 
sauce made from the gravy in which the fish has been cooked. 

Sandwiches of Fillets of Sole, Lobster, or Salmon. — 

Cook the fillets of sole in a saucepan with a little clarified but- 
ter, pepper, salt, and lemon juice. When done, put them in 
press between two dishes. When cold, divide each fillet into 
four pieces, trim, and put in a bowl with a French dressing made 
of white pepper, salt, vinegar, and oil. Have some small oval 
rolls at hand, cut off the tops and remove the crumbs, moisten 
the bottom of each roll with a littte of the dressing, place a 
piece of sole on this, add a little mayonnaise sauce, cover with 
the tops, and servT. Sandwiches of lobster and salmon are pre- 
pared in the same manner. If desired, each one may have a 
finely chopped onion sprinkled over it before the mayonnaise is 
added. 

Fillets of Sole a la Venitienne. — Take the fillets of four 
soles, trim and place one-half of them in a saucepan with some 
clarified butter, a little lemon juice, white pepper, and salt. Let 
them simmer slowly for ten minutes. Simmer the other fillets, 
without trimming them, in the same manner. When they are 
done, drain them and set away to cool. Cut the untrimmed 
fillets into small dice. Mix them with some thick Allemande 
sauce, two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, white pepper and 
salt to taste, and a dash of grated nutmeg. Spread this prepara- 
tion about one-sixth of an inch thick on an earthen dish, and 
when it has become firm cut it into pieces about the size and 
shape of the fillets. Roll them in fine bread crumbs, then in 
beaten egg, and then again in bread crumbs. Just before serv- 
ing warm the fillets, fry the croquettes in hot lard, drain both on 
a piece of brown paper. Arrange them in a close circle, placing 
alternately the croquettes and the fillets. Fill the centre with 
small fish forcemeat balls, fried in hot lard. Pour some Veni- 
tienne sauce in the centre and on the fillets and serve. 

Fish Timbales. — Take a cup of any cold cooked fish;

hold together. Butter mold, turn the fish in, stand it in a 
pan of hot water, bake in oven for one-half hour. 

Tongues and Sounds. — Soak the tongues and sounds in 
cold water over night. Put them in cold water and place on the 
fire. Let them boil thirty minutes and serve with drawn butter. 

Turbot a la Creme. — In place of turbot, either bass or 
codfish will answer. Boil with plenty of salt, remove the skin 
and bones, and flake it. Boil one quart of cream, and while 
boiling stir in three tablespoonfuls of flour, perfectly smooth, and 
add a bunch of parsley and one onion. Take out both vege- 
tables. Clarify a quarter of a pound of butter and add to the 
cream after it is boiled. Butter a deep dish, and put in first a 
layer of fish, then one of sauce, alternating till the dish is filled, 
making the sauce come on top. Strew over a layer of sifted 
bread crumbs and bake an hour. Garnish the dish with chopped 
eggs or parsley. 



FISH AND MEAT SAUCES. 97 



FISH AND MEAT SAUCES. 

Many people fail in making sauces by not cooking the flour 
sufficiently, and also by serving them with a mass of oily butter 
on the surface. Usually the flour is wet to a smooth paste and 
stirred into the boiling liquid. When made in this manner, the 
sauce should boil at least ten minutes to have the flour thoroughly 
cooked. But by cooking the dry flour in the hot butter the starch 
in the flour is more quickly cooked, and the butter is all absorbed 
and converted into an emulsion. Sauces made in this manner 
are perfectly smooth, free from grease, and have a fine flavor. 
Every one should learn how to make both white and brown 
sauces. They are adapted to nearly every form of food. Meats, 
fish, vegetables, eggs, macaroni, rice, toast, etc., are rendered 
more palatable by being served with an appropriate sauce. 

How to Make Sauce. — Melt a tablespoonful of butter in 
saucepan and add a tablespoonful of flour. Strain the gravy 
from the pan in which the fish has been cooked. Add a full cup 
of it to the butter and flour. Let it come to a boil, then cook 
five minutes. Season to taste, add one-half cup of rich cream. 
Serve very hot in sauce-boat. 

Brown Sauce. — One pint hot stock, two tablespoonfuls 
minced onion, two tablespoonfuls butter, two heaping tablespoon- 
fuls flour, one-half teaspoonful salt, one-half saltspoonful pepper, 
one tablespoonful lemon juice, caramel enough to color. 

Mince the onion and fry it in the butter five minutes. Be 
careful not to burn it. When the butter is brown, add the dry 
flour and stir well. Add the hot stock a little at a time and stir 
rapidly, as it thickens, until perfectly smooth. Add the salt and 
pepper, using more if high seasoning is desired. Simmer five 
minutes, and strain to remove the onion. 

The stock for brown sauces may be made from bones and rem- 
nants of any kind of meat, by soaking them in cold water, and 
boiling until the nutriment is extracted. The onion may be 
omitted if the flavor be not desired j but the sauce is better with 
it if it be not burned. 

By the addition of different seasoning materials to this brown 
sauce a great variety of sauces may be made. Half the quantity 
given is sufficient for most entrees, or to use for any purpose in a 



98 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

small family. Be careful not to burn the butter, as the desired 
color can better be obtained by adding caramel. 

Drawn Butter, No. 1. — To one heaping tablespoonful of 
butter take one heaping tablespoonful of flour, a little salt, and 
enough hot water to dissolve this cream. Thicken by standing

juice or vinegar, then add more oil. Alternate in this way until 
one cup olive oil is used and dressing is thick and glossy, like a 
jelly. About three tablespoonfuls lemon juice or two of vinegar 
will be needed, according to its acidity. Always stir in the same 
direction. Keep covered and on ice until needed. 

Clam Sauce. — Take one quart of freshly opened Little 
Neck clams, half pint of water, an ounce of butter, and boil five 
minutes. Mix two ounces of butter, one ounce of flour, and a

and one-half pint of clam liquor. Stir with egg-beater, boil a 
minute or two, add two ^^^g yolks, twice as much water as egg 
yolks, and a little lemon juice. Strain through a wet cloth. Then 
mix in four ounces of butter, drain the clams, put them in the 
sauce, and serve hot.

One pint of water, one quart of white wine, one tablespoonful of 
butter, a bunch of parsley, a few young onions, one clove of 
garlic, a bunch of thyme, one bay leaf, one carrot, and a blade of 
mace. Boil the fish in this bouillon, which will do for use several 
times. Any kind of fish, such as salmon, trout, pompano, sheeps- 
head, carp, may be boiled in this way. Lobster boiled in court

OYSTERS. 

Oysters, Clams, Scallops, Lobsters, Crabs, Shrimps, and 
Prawns are the principal varieties of shell fish used as food. 

These shell fish are found in perfection in the cool waters of 
the Northern Atlantic coast. The Wareham and the Providence 
River are esteemed in Boston. Oysters are neither healthful nor 
well flavored from May to September ; at all other times they are 
used more extensively and are more highly prized than any other 
shell fish. They are nutritious, are easily digested when fresh 
and eaten raw, or when only slightly cooked. When over- 
cooked, they are tough and leathery. Oysters should never be 
kept long after being taken from the shell ; and if to be used raw 
should not be opened till just before using. 

To Prepare Oysters for Cooking. — Pour half a cup of 
cold water over one quart of oysters ; take out each oyster sepa- 
rately with fingers and free from any bits of shell. The oyster 
liquor may be strained and used in soup, stew, or escallop if 
desired. Fried and broiled oysters are much better and cook 
easier if parboiled slightly before crumbing. Place one pint of 
cleaned oysters in a frying basket and keep it for one-half minute 
in a kettle of boihng water deep enough to cover them. Drain, 
dry on a soft towel and proceed as usual. 

Oysters a la Bechamel. — Drain one pint oysters and save 
the liquor ; for twenty-five oysters add milk to the liquor to make 
half a pint. Put one tablespoonful butter and one of flour in 
chafing-dish, then light the lamp ; mix thoroughly ; add liquor 
and milk, stir until it reaches the boiling point ; add oysters, half 
a teaspoonful salt, a quarter teaspoonful black pepper, and a dash 
of red pepper ; cover the dish, and when boiling, stir in lastly 
the yolks of three eggs beaten with two tablespoonfuls of cream ; 
after putting out the light add a teaspoonful of lemon juice, half 
a teaspoonful of onion juice, and serve on toast. 

Oysters a la Beleveu. — One-quarter pound butter melted 
in chafing-dish ; add one-half cup finely chopped celery and cook 
thoroughly ; put in one quart cream (or milk) with juice of 
oysters ; allow it to just come to a boil, then add one pint of 
oysters ; add a dash of paprika, salt and pepper, and just before 
serving add a wine-glass Madeira wine. 



OYSTERS. 103 

Oyster Bisque. — Two quarts of oysters in a saucepan with a 
little white pepper, nutmeg, two blades of mace, one bay leaf, 
one pinch of red pepper, two ounces of butter, one pmt of white 
broth. Cover, boil ten minutes, drain in a colander, and save 
the liquor. Then chop the oysters very fine and put them on a 
plate. Knead five ounces of flour in a saucepan with four ounces 
of melted butter. Stir and cook a little without allowing to 
brown. Then dilute with three pints of boiled milk and the 
oyster liquor. Add the oysters, stir steadily, and boil ten min- 
utes. Rub through a very fine sieve and add more milk if 
required. Stir and boil again. Finish with one-half pint of raw 
cream and four ounces of butter in small bits. Taste, pour in 
soup tureen, and serve hot, with small squares of bread fried in 
butter separately on a plate. 

Baked in Shells, No. 1. — Take large oysters, dry between 
towels, dip in egg, then in dry bread crumbs that have been sea- 
soned with salt, pepper, and a grating of nutmeg. Put the 
oysters in their shells, dot with butter, lay the shells in a dripping 
pan and bake till brown. Serve at once in their shells, with a 
dash of lemon juice on each. 

Baked Oysters, No. 2. — Put a round of toasted bread into 
a small baking cup or dish ; spread with butter and fill with 
oysters ; season with salt, pepper, and butter. Fill as many cups 
as required, place them in a baking pan in oven, cover with a pan 
and bake about ten minutes. 

Broiled Oysters, No. 1. — Take the largest oysters, scald, 
drain, dry on a towel and dip one by one into softened butter till 
well coated and then in seasoned flour. Lay them on a buttered 
broiler. Cook over clear coals until a light brown. Serve on 
slices of buttered thin toast. If done by a gas stove, lay the 
toast under the broiler to catch the drip. Fine cracker crumbs 
may be used instead of flour. Oysters that have been breaded 
for frying are good broiled. 

Broiled Oysters, No. 2. — Take two dozen large oysters, 
cleaned, drained, and dried in a soft cloth. Sprinkle with salt 
and pepper. Melt two ounces butter in a large frying-pan, lay in 
one dozen ; as soon as the last one is in, turn the first one and 
when all have been turned, begin taking out, laying them closely 
on a large buttered oyster broiler ; cook to a light brown over 



104 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

moderate fire. While these are browning, the other dozen may 
" set" in the butter. Have six rounds of toast on a hot platter; 
put four oysters on each, sprinkle on the butter in which they 
were stiffened and serve with lemon cut in eighths. 

Broiled Oysters, No. 3. — Look over the oysters, rejecting 
bits of shells ; dry between towels ; dip in melted butter or olive 
oil seasoned with salt and pepper ; heat the oyster broiler, wipe 
over wilh butter ; lay on the oysters and broil over a clear fire — 
charcoal is best — for four or five minutes, turning often ; serve 
on rounds of toasted bread, spread with butter and slightly 
moistened with the oyster liquor (which has been heated), garnish 
with sprigs of parsley and lemon. These are delicious served 
with pickled peaches. 

Broiled Oysters, No. 4. — Pick, wash, and drain large 
oysters. Dip each in melted butter, roll in fine crumbs, and 
broil in fine wire broiler over a clear, hot fire. Serve on toast

oysters as are required. Dip them in melted butter, then in 
cracker crumbs which have been seasoned with pepper and salt. 
Lay them on a well-buttered fine broiler and broil until slightly 
colored. 

Broiled Oysters, No. 6. — Drain select oysters in a colan- 
der. Dip them one by one into melted butter, to prevent stick- 
ing to the gridiron, and place them on a wire gridiron. Broil 
over a clear fire. When nicely browned on both sides, season 
with salt, pepper, and plenty of butter, and lay them on hot 
buttered toast, moistened with a little hot water. Serve very 
hot. Oysters cooked in this way and served on broiled beefsteak 
are delicious. 

Creamed Oysters, No. 1. — Prepare cream sauce, taking 
one-half the quantity of butter ; scald the oysters until the edges 
begin to curl, drain and drop them into the cream sauce ; let all 
stand in bain marie for five minutes to season thoroughly. Serve 
in Swedish timbales or in pate shells. It is very nice used as a 
filling for short cake, croustade, or on toast.

part. Stir them into the sauce. Let them come to a boil or 
until they begin to curl. Fill each croustade with the mixture 
and serve very hot. 

Oyster Croustades. — Take six nice pieces of butter the 
size of an egg. Shape them a little wider at one end than the 
other. Roll them thickly in bread crumbs, then in beaten yolks 
of three eggs, then again in bread crumbs. Set them on ice for 
half an hour. When cold, drop them, one by one, in boiling fat 
and fry until a delicate brown. With a sharp knife take off the

very thin and fat bacon, and some parsley. Scald the oysters in 
their own liquor. Remove the hard part, also the black edge or 
beard, as it is called. Cut the part remaining into small pieces, 
also the chicken and mushrooms very fine. Make a cream 
sauce, add the liquor the oysters were scalded in, and boil until 
it is very thick. A little cream, if you have it, could be added. 
Mix it with the oysters, chicken, and mushrooms ; stir in the 
yolks of three eggs, stir it over the fire for three or four minutes. 
Spread the mixture on a dish and set it away to cool. When 
thoroughly cold, roll into pieces about the size and shape of a

sliced oysters, a little chopped parsley, and a dash of red pepper. 
Stir constantly and boil three minutes longer. Then stir in the 
juice of one lemon and set away to cool. When cold, divide the 
mixture into pieces the size of an egg, roll them in pulverized 
crackers, and with the blade of a knife give them a rectangular 
shape about one inch thick. Dip in beaten eggs, then in crackers 
again, and fry a light brown in plenty of clear hot lard. Dish up 
on a folded napkin, garnish with fried parsley and quartered 
lemons, and serve.

pepper a little. Add a thin small strip of bacon that has been 
fried crisp ; then season the oysters. Sprinkle a very little of the 
onion, parsley, and green pepper over the top and criss-cross 
with two tiny bacon strips. Put on the covers and bake just long 
enough to heat thoroughly, then uncover and brown the bacon 
quickly. Replace the covers and serve at once with cut lemon. 

Curried Oysters. — Cook one quart of oysters over a slow 
fire in their own juice. If the juice is not sufficient to cook them 
add a little water. Add also a tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoon-

Roll them in fine crumbs and broil over a clear fire. Arrange 
and serve. 

Fried Oysters, No. 1. — Select large oysters, clean, and 
parboil slightly to draw out some of the water. Drain and dry on 
a towel. Roll in fine bread and cracker crumbs, dip in mayon- 
naise dressing, then in crumbs again. Let them stand five 
minutes, and if they seem moist, dip again in crumbs, and cook 
in deep hot fat for one minute. Being already cooked, they only 
need to be thoroughly heated and the crumbs browned. 

Fried Oysters, No. 2. — Pick over, scald and drain dry 
two dozen oysters, sprinkle lightly with red pepper, roll in cracker 
dust, dip in tgg mixed with an equal quantity of thick cream ; 
drain and roll in fresh fine bread crumbs ; press gently with a 
palette knife, fry half a dozen at a time in clear fat, hot enough 
to brown them in one minute. As soon as the first basket is 
lifted, drop in a half a dozen slices of raw potato to keep the fat 
from burning while the oysters are changed for another half dozen ; 
proceed in this way until all are done. Put in a whole potato in 
slices and take from the fire at once ; with a little care the same 
fat may be used repeatedly, when otherwise it would be blackened 
the first time. Drain the oysters on soft brown paper. Have a 
tuft of parsley on a hot folded napkin ; range the oysters quickly 
and serve instantly. It is better not to begin frying until they 
are wanted than to delay serving. Nothing can be less inviting 
than a cold fried oyster or one that has been kept hot for five 
minutes. 

Philadelphia Fry : Proceed as before, but after they are rolled 
in crumbs the first time, dip them in very cold, thick mayonnaise, 
then into tgg, and roll in crumbs again before frying. This is 
difficult but delicious. 

Sauteed : To one pint prepared oysters put one pint stale bread 
crumbs, season and add two eggs beaten lightly. Let them stand 
one hour, then lay by spoonfuls in a frying-pan and brown quickly 
on both sides in hot butter. Serve at once. 

Fried Oysters, No. 3. — Select the largest and finest fresh 
oysters, put them into a colander and pour over a little water to 
rinse them ; then place them on a clean towel and dry them. 
Have ready some grated bread crumbs seasoned with pepper and 
salt, and plenty of yolk of egg beaten till very light ; and to each 
egg allow a large teaspoonful of rich cream or of the best fresh

butter. Beat the egg and cream together. Dip each oyster first 
into the egg and cream and then into the crumbs. Repeat this 
twice, until the oysters are well coated all over. Have ready 
boiling, in a frying-pan, an equal mixture of fresh butter and lard. 
It must very nearly fill the frying-pan, and be boiling fast when 
the oysters go in, otherwise they will be heavy and greasy. Fry 
them a yellow brown on both sides and serve hot. 

Fried Oysters, No. 4. — Select the largest oysters, drain 
and dry between towels ; dip in beaten egg, then in dry sifted 
bread crumbs which have been seasoned with salt and pepper, 
and fry in a wire basket in deep fat. 

These may be prepared some hours before cooking and the 
breading process :cepeated after the first coat is dry. 

Fried Oysters, No. 5. — Select largest and finest oysters. 
Drain and wipe them by spreading upon cloth, laying another 
over them, pressing lightly. Roll each in beaten egg, then in 
cracker crumbs with which has been mixed a very little pepper. 
Fry in mixture of equal parts of lard and butter. 

Oysters Fried in Batter. — One cup of milk, two eggs well 
beaten, pepper, salt, and flour to make a moderately stiff batter. 

Add one cup of oysters with their liquor, season with grated 
nutmeg, and drop by spoonfuls into deep fat and fry. One-half 
a teaspoonful of baking powder sifted into the flour will make a 
light and puffy batter. If preferred the oysters may be dipped 
in the batter one at a time, but small oysters are better when 
mixed with the batter. 

Fricassee of Oysters, No. 1. — Select thirty medium-sized 
oysters. Place them in their own liquor on the stove and let 
come to a boil. Skim them and pour in a strainer. Heat one 
tablespoonful of butter, add two tablespoonfuls of flour, mix 
thoroughly and then stir in the oyster liquor and half a pint 
of cream. Season with white pepper, a dash of cayenne, and 
salt. Beat thoroughly the yolks of two eggs with the juice of 
half a lemon. Stir into the sauce. Then add the oysters and 
serve very hot. 

Oyster Fricassee, No. 2. — Melt one cup of butter in the 
frying-pan, add one quart of oysters, let come to a boil, then add 
one-half cup of cream with salt and pepper to taste and one

butter into a frying-pan and when hot put in one pint of oysters 
washed and drained. Cook till plump and drain again. Pour 
the oyster liquor into a cup and fill with cream. Cook one table- 
spoonful flour with one of butter and blend with cream and oyster 
liquor; add one-half saltspoonful pepper and about one- half 
teaspoonful salt. (Oysters vary in freshness.) Beat one egg very 
light and pour the oyster sauce upon it ; add the oysters and 
return to the pan to be well heated, but it must not boil. Stir 
gently that it may cook evenly. Serve in crust or pastry shells if 
for lunch or dinner ; for breakfast or tea on toast. 

Brown Fricassee of Oysters. — One quart oysters, two 
large tablespoonfuls butter, one scant tablespoonful flour, a dust 
of cayenne, salt according to the oysters, and one-half teaspoon- 
ful chopped parsley. Brown the butter and flour, add the oysters 
prepared as directed, stir carefully not to break them, and as soon 
as they curl serve on a hot platter with eight triangles of toast, 
one for each portion. 

Griddled Oysters. — Clean, scald, and drain two dozen 
large oysters. Have a large griddle evenly heated ; drop on it a 
bit of sweet butter as large as a pea and put an oyster on it ; 
lay on one dozen and give them plenty of room ; put on another 
bit of butter and turn the first oyster on to that ; proceed in this 
way for all. Do not let them burn, but they must brown quickly. 
If too much butter is put on it will spread over the griddle and 
scorch and the smoke will ruin the oysters. Serve four to each 
person on a two-inch square of rye shortcake. 

Hunter's Cake. — • Chop some fresh button mushrooms, 
chives, parsley and shallots together, and sprinkle over the 
oysters after they are drained and placed in buttered oblong

oysters in small pieces, sprinkle half a teaspoonful of salt over 
them, and let them stand in their own liquor, in a cool place, for 
half an hour. Beat six eggs, the yolks and whites apart ; the 
former to smooth paste, the latter to a solid froth. Add to the 
yolks a tablespoonful of rich, sweet cream, pepper and salt in 
sufficient quantity, and then lightly stir in the whites. Put an 
ounce and a half of butter in a hot frying-pan, and when it is 
thoroughly melted, and begins to fry, pour in the egg mixture, 
and add as quickly as possible the oysters. Do not stir, but with 
a long-bladed omelet knife lift, as the eggs set, the omelet from 
the pan, to prevent its scorching. In five minutes, it will be

pour in the strained liquor of two dozen small oysters. Lastly, 
add the oysters. Stir for a few minutes and fill patties prepared 
as follows : Line some patty pans with thin puff paste, fill with 
rice so they will keep their shape, cover the top with another

OYSTERS. 115 

Heat a frying-pan and put in the " little pigs." Cook just long 
enough to crisp the bacon. Place on slices of toast that have 
been cut into small pieces and serve immediately. Do not 
remove the skewers. This is a nice relish for lunch or tea ; and, 
garnished with parsley, is a pretty one. The pan must be very 
hot before the "pigs" are put in. Great care must be taken 
that they do not burn. 

Pigs in Blankets, No. 2. — Have at hand oysters, salt, 
pepper, sliced fat bacon. Clean, and season some nice large

varied by addition of a little chopped celery or onion. 

Stewed Oysters a la Baltimore, No. 3. — Open neatly 
three dozen oysters. Place them in a saucepan without their 
liquor and add one ounce of good butter. Cover the pan and 
place it over the fire. Cook for two minutes. Then add one wine-

until it comes to a boil. Just before serving add the juice of one 
lemon, one teaspoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of finely 
chopped parsley. Serve immediately in a tureen. 

Steamed Oysters. — Procure oysters in the shell. Wash 
them thoroughly and arrange in a steamer, flat side up. Cover 
closely, place over boihng water and let steam about twenty-five 
minutes. When the shells open, the oysters are done. Remove 
the lower shells, put a bit of butter on each, sprinkle with pep- 
per and salt, garnish with cut lemon and serve hot on hot plates. 

Shirred Oysters. — Chop twenty-five oysters, add the beaten

sized oysters. Moisten one teacup of cracker crumbs with one- 
third of a cup of melted butter. Spread one-quarter of the 
crumbs in a baking dish, over them put one-half of the oysters,

another quarter of a cup of the crumbs, then the remaining 
oysters. Season again with salt, pepper, and lemon juice, and 
cover with the remaining crumbs. Bake in quick oven until the 
liquor bubbles and the crumbs are brown.

cleaned and drained, one-half cup butter, one cup grated bread 
crumbs, one cup coarse cracker crumbs. Rub the pudding pan 
thickly with cold butter and sprinkle a layer of bread crumbs, 
moisten the rest of the bread with part of the butter melted and 
stir the rest of the butter into the cracker. Arrange oysters and 
bread in alternate layers, using cracker for the top. Season 
each with pepper and salt, allowing one and one-half teaspoon- 
fuls of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper, and about one tablespoon- 
ful of lemon juice for the whole. Pour over one-quarter cup of 
the oyster liquor and set aside for an hour. If it looks very dry 
add another one-quarter cup of oyster juice before baking. Cook 
about twenty-five minutes in a quick oven. Wine, milk, or Worces- 
tershire sauce are sometimes used, but are no improvement. 
One suspects that the oysters are not fresh when disguised by such 
high seasoning. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 3. — Cover the bottom of a baking 
dish (well buttered) with a layer of crumbs, and wet these with 
cream, put on spoonful by spoonful. Pepper and salt, and strew 
with minute bits of butter. Next, put in the oysters, with a little 
of their liquor. Pepper them, stick bits of butter in among them, 
and cover with dry crumbs until the oysters are entirely hidden.

top. Set in the oven, invert a plate over it to keep in the flavor, 
and bake until the juice bubbles up to the top. Remove the 
cover, and brown on the upper grating for two or three minutes. 
Serve in the baking dish. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 4. — Open the shells, setting aside 
for use the deepest ones. Have ready some melted butter, not 
hot, seasoned with minced parsley and pepper. Roll each oyster 
in this, letting it drip as little as may be, and lay in the shells, 
which should be arranged in a baking pan. Add to each a little 
lemon juice, sift bread crumbs over it, and bake in a quick oven 
until done. Serve in the shells.

Scalloped Oysters, No. 5. — Make a cream sauce, using a 
pint of milk; pour a little into a buttered pudding dish, add a 
layer of oysters, sprinkle with bread crumbs seasoned with salt 
and pepper and dotted with butter ; add another layer of sauce, 
then oysters, crumbs, and butter ; repeat this process until the 
dish is full, having crumbs and dots of butter on top. Bake in a 
moderate oven. Cerealine or cracker crumbs may be used 
instead of bread crumbs, and a grating of cheese on top is often 
an improvement. Sprinkle lightly with chopped parsley before 
sending to the table. Serve with olives. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 6. — Pick, wash, and drain one 
solid quart oysters. Put in layers in baking dish, alternating with 
dry bread or cracker crumbs and seasoning. When dish is filled 
add strained oyster liquor and sufficient milk to moisten. Cover 
with crumbs, add one tablespoonful butter in bits, and bake one- 
half hour in hot oven. 

Stuffed Oysters. — Have at hand twenty-eight large oysters 
and some chicken forcemeat prepared as follows : Scrape and 
pound the breast of an uncooked medium-sized fowl, then rub it 
through a puree sieve. Mix one-quarter of a cup of cream or 
milk with one-eighth of a cup of fine bread crumbs. Cook them 
slowly until they form a smooth paste. Then add the chicken, 
the white of one egg, one tablespoonful of butter, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, a bit of white pepper. Mix all together thor- 
oughly and set away to cool. Dry the oysters thoroughly and 
season them with salt and pepper. Roll them in bread crumbs. 
Arrange the forcemeat in half as many pieces as you have oysters 
and at a corresponding size. Place a piece on fourteen oysters, 
cover with the remaining oysters. Press them together so they will 
stick. Take one whole egg and the yolk left from the forcemeat. 
Beat it well, season with a little salt. Dip each oyster in the tgg, 
then roll them in bread crumbs. Have them well covered with egg 
and crumbs. Fry in hot fat until a good color. Drain on brown 
paper and serve very hot with Madeira sauce in a separate dish. 

Oysters Roasted in the Shell, No. 1. — Wash the shells 
clean and wipe dry. Place in a baking pan and put in a hot oven 
for about twenty minutes. Serve on hot dishes the moment they 
are taken from the oven. Though this is not an elegant dish, 
many people enjoy it, as the first and best flavor of the oysters is 
retained in this manner of cooking. The oysters can, instead, be 



OYSTERS. 119 

opened into a hot dish and seasoned with butter, salt, pepper, and 
lemon juice. They should be served immediately. 

Oysters Roasted in the Shell, No. 2. — Wash and scrub 
the shells. Cook in hot oven, on top of stove, over red-hot coals, 
or in steamer until shells open. Always place them round shell 
down to retain juice. Serve melted butter and vinegar or lemons 
with them. 

Roasted Oysters. — Take oysters in the shell; wash the 
shells clean, and lay them on hot coals ; when they are done they 
will begin to open. Remove the upper shell, and serve the 
oysters in the lower shell, with a little melted butter poured over 
each, and season to taste. 

Raw Oysters. — Raw oysters are best served in their own 
shells, on plates of cracked ice. Blue points are the favorite. A 
square block of ice, with the centre melted out and surrounded by 
a wreath of parsley, makes a pretty receptacle for raw oysters. 
They may be served without the shells, on beds of cracked ice, 
or in the oyster plates which have shell-like depressions, with a 
place for ice in the centre. Salt, red pepper and quarters of 
lemon are served with this dish. 

Oysters on the Half Shell. — Keep on ice till serving time. 
Have small soup plates half full of fine ice and lay the oysters in 
the deep half of the shell, on the plates as fast as opened. Salt, 
pepper, and a cut lemon should be served at the side, and a true 
oyster lover will use no other sauce. Small oysters are preferred, 
and four to six are enough for each plate. 

On a Block of Ice. — Have the dealer chip in a ten-pound 
block of perfectly clear ice a cavity large enough to hold as many 
oysters as are to be served. Clean and drain them as usual, but 
do not season, as it causes the juice to flow. Fold a large towel 
and cover it with a napkin to lay in the platter ; prop the block of 
ice carefully with wads of cloth, lest it should tilt in melting. Fill 
the platter full of parsley, so that the ice should seem to be rest- 
ing on green leaves only, and garnish the edge of the oysters 
with fine small sprigs of parsley and celery tips. 

Oyster Salad, No. 1 . — Scald oysters until they are plump, 
and then put them in cold water while they are boiling hot, so as

to make them firm. Put them to one side and boil five eggs 
hard. Take off the whites and chop very fine. Lay a bed of 
white lettuce in a long dish. Place the oysters on this. Cover 
the oysters with a mayonnaise dressing. Over them place the 
yolks of the eggs, which have been mashed very fine, and lastly 
the chopped whites of the eggs. Do not let it stand very long 
before serving. If you do the oysters and mayonnaise will 
become watery. Be sure the lettuce is thoroughly dried. 

Oyster Salad, No. 2. — First bring to a boil one pint of 
oysters, drain from liquor, and when cold mix with two stalks of 
celery cut in fine pieces ; place on a bed of lettuce leaves or water- 
cress and serve with mayonnaise dressing and crisped crackers. 

Oyster Salad, No. 3. — Bring to a boil four dozen small 
oysters, in their own liquor, skim and strain ; season with a little 
salt, pepper, and vinegar ; when cold add about half the quantity 
of chopped celery and a cup of salad cream, garnish the dish with 
celery leaves and thin slices of lemon sprinkled with parsley over 
the top. 

Oyster Sauce. — Strain fifty oysters ; put the juice into a 
saucepan ; add one pint of new milk ; let it simmer, and then 
skim off whatever froth may rise. Rub a large spoonful of flour 
and two of butter together; stir this into the liquor; add a little 
salt and pepper. Let this simmer five minutes, but do not add 
the oysters till just as they are to be sent to the table, as oysters 
much cooked are hard. For turkeys, etc., this is a splendid 
dressing. 

Oyster Shortcake. — Boil one quart oysters in their own 
liquor. As soon as scum is set, remove it and drain and return 
one pint of liquor to saucepan. Mix scant tablespoonful of 
flour with two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter. When the mix- 
ture is light and creamy, gradually turn upon it the boiling liquor 
and season with salt and pepper. After boiling up once, stir in 
three tablespoonfuls of cream, also the oysters. Stir over the 
fire one- half minute. Serve immediately. Have shortcake 
ready to fill. 

Spindled Oysters. — For six persons take two dozen large 
oysters, two ounces bacon and six small slices of thin toast. Six 
slender steel skewers will be needed. Cut two dozen wafers of 



OYSTERS. 121 

bacon. Fill the skewers with bacon and oysters alternately, run- 
ning the skewer cross-grain through the muscle of the oyster and 
stringing the bits of bacon by one corner so that each slice may 
overlie an oyster ; do not crowd them. Lay the skewers across 
a baking pan and cook under gas or in a quick oven for five min- 
utes. Do not take the oysters from the spindle, but lay each one 
on a slice of toast, pour over them the drip from the pan and 
serve at once. 

Oysters Baked on Toast. — Butter squares of toast and 
lay them, butter side down, on a platter. Lay the oysters on the 
toast, bring the liquor to a boil with a tablespoonful of butter, 
season with salt and pepper, and strain it over the oysters and 
toast. Put the platter into a hot oven until the edges of the 
oysters ruffle. Serve on the same dish with slices of lemon. 

Roasted Oysters on Toast. — Eighteen large oysters, or 
thirty small ones, half a pint of cream, one teaspoonful of flour, 
one tablespoonful of butter, salt, pepper, three slices of toast. 
Have the toast buttered and on a hot dish. Put the butter in 
a small saucepan, and when hot add the flour. Stir until smooth, 
but not brown ; then add the cream and let it boil up once. 
Put the oysters (in their own liquor) into a hot oven for three 
minutes ; then add them to the cream. Season and pour over 
the toast. Garnish the dish with thin slices of lemon and serve 
very hot. It is nice for lunch or tea. 

Oyster Toast. — Select fifteen plump oysters ; mince them, 

and season with mixed pepper and a pinch of nutmeg ; beat the 
yolks of four eggs and mix them with half a pint of cream. Put 
the whole into a saucepan and set it over the fire to simmer till 
thick ; stir it well, and do not let it boil, lest it should curdle. 
Toast five pieces of bread, and butter them ; when your dish is 
near the boiling point, remove it from the fire and pour it over 
the toast. 

Plain Oyster Soup. — Pour a quart of oysters in colander, 
rinse by pouring over them a pint cold water. Put this in a 
porcelain kettle, add a pint boiling water, let boil, skim thor- 
oughly, season with pepper and piece butter size of large egg. 
Then add oysters, having removed all shells ; let boil up once, 
season with salt and serve.

CLAMS. 

Thin shell clams (soft shells) and round shell clams (quahaugs) 
furnish a delicious and wholesome form of food if eaten Only 
when fresh. They are more easily opened and have a finer flavor 
when cooked in the shells. 

There is no special season for these most nutritious fish, but 
custom decrees that they shall be served only during the season 
when oysters are forbidden. Most of the methods of serving 
oysters can be applied with slight modification to the cooking of 
clams. 

A Clam Bake. — An impromptu clam bake may be had at 
any time at low tide along the coast where clams are found. If 
you wish to have genuine fun, and to know what an appetite one 
can have for the bivalves, make up a pleasant party and dig for 
the clams yourselves. A short, thick dress, shade hat, rubber 
boots, — or, better still, no boots at all, if you can bring your 
mind to the comfort of bare feet, — a small garden trowel, a fork, 
and a basket, and you are ready. Let those who are not digging 
gather a large pile of driftwood and seaweed, always to be found 
along the shore. Select a dozen or more large stones, and of 
them make a level floor ; pile the driftwood upon them, and make 
a good brisk fire to heat the stones thoroughly. When hot 
enough to crackle as you sprinkle water upon them, brush the 
embers off, letting them fall between the stones. Put a thin layer 
of seaweed on the hot stones, to keep the lower clams from 
burning. Rinse the clams in salt water by plunging the basket 
which contains them in the briny pools nearby. Pile them over 
the hot stones, heaping them high in the centre. Cover with a 
thick layer of seaweed, and a piece of old canvas, blanket, car- 
pet, or dry leaves to keep in the steam. The time for baking 
will depend upon the size and quantity of the clams. Peep in 
occasionally at those around the edge. When the shells are open 
the clams are done. They are delicious eaten from the shell 
with no other sauce than their own briny sweetness. Melted 
butter, pepper, and vinegar should be ready for those who wish 
them ; then all may " fall to." Fingers must be used. A Rhode 
Islander would laugh at any one trying to use a knife and fork. 
Pull off the thin skin, take them by the black end, dip them in 
the prepared butter, and bite off close to the end. If you swal- 



CLAMS. 123 

low them whole they will not hurt you. At a genuine Rhode 
Island clam bake, bluefish, lobsters, crabs, sweet potatoes, and 
ears of sweet corn in their gauzy husks are baked with the clams. 
The clam steam gives them a delicious flavor. Brown bread is 
served with the clams, and watermelon for dessert completes the 
feast. 

Baked Soft-shell Clams. — Select as many soft-shell clams 
as are desired. Be sure to get very large ones. Scrub the shells 
clean. Then remove the string and loosen the clam from the 
shell, leaving it as nearly whole as possible. Season each clam 
in its shell with pepper and a little butter. Then place a very 
thin slice of pork over each one and replace the other half of 
the shell. Set them in a pan and bake in a moderate oven until 
thoroughly steamed. 

Clam Broth. — Twenty-five clams washed and drained, steam 
till the shells open easily ; save every drop of juice that comes 
with opening and add enough water to make one quart. With 
a pair of scissors trim off the soft part of the clam and reserve 
to serve with the broth. Chop the tough portion a little and 
simmer fifteen minutes in the broth. Strain and add pepper and 
salt if needed and serve in very small bouillon cups. Send the 
reserved portion to the table with melted butter and lemon juice 
poured over them. 

Clam Bisque, No. 1. — Boil one quart of opened clams for 
twenty minutes in three pints of good veal consomme. Strain 
and add two tablespoonfuls of butter, two tablespoonfuls of

minutes longer. Season with salt and white pepper to taste. 

Clam Bisque, No. 2. — Wash two quarts soft-shelled clams, 
put in a kettle with one-half cup hot water, cover, and cook until 
shells open. Drain the liquor from clams and strain through a 
double thickness of cheesecloth. Add enough boiling water to 
make one quart liquid. Cook one tablespoonful finely cut onion 
and two tablespoonfuls grated carrot in two tablespoonfuls butter 
five minutes. Add two tablespoonfuls flour and stir until well 
blended, then pour on gradually while stirring constantly the clam 
liquor. Bring to the boiling point, strain and add one cup

add two quarts milk. 

Clam Cocktail. — Open twelve small clams carefully and 
place the clams and their juice in a basin to allow any sand or 
shell to settle, then carefully remove them to another bowl and 
place them on ice. When they are thoroughly chilled, add suffi- 
cient catsup to fill four glasses about as large as claret glasses, 
one small teaspoonful of grated horse-radish, three shakes of 
tabasco sauce, one tablespoonful of vinegar, and the iced clams. 
Sometimes one-half teaspoonful of grated onion is added. Serve

SCALLOPS. 

The only edible part of the scallop is the central muscle by 
which the mollusk opens and closes its shell. Shippers some- 
times add saleratus to the scallops to improve their appearance, 
but this is a detriment to the fish. In buying, avoid the large 
ones that are white, choosing instead those of medium size and 
the natural creamy white color. They are most appetizing when 
fried. Rinse them in salt water, dry in a napkin, and dredge 
with flour. Fry in very hot pork fat. Eggs and crumbs are not 
needed. 

Devilled Scallops. — Put one quart of scallops in a saucepan 
and heat in their own liquor just to the boiling point. Drain, 
save the liquor, and chop them rather fine. From one-half of a 
cup of butter remove one tablespoonful. Beat the contents of 
the cup to a cream, and add one teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth 
of a teaspoonful of cayenne, and one teaspoonful of made mus- 
tard. Beat thoroughly and mix with one cup of white stock — 
have it hot. Stir the chopped scallops and their liquor into this 
sauce and let them stand for half an hour. At the end of that 
time put them in an escalop dish or shells. Sprinkle with the 
crumbs, dot with the tablespoonful of butter, and bake in a mod- 
erate oven for twenty minutes. 

Fried Scallops, No. 1 . — Wash and dry the necessary amount 
of scallops. Season them with salt and white pepper. Roll them 
in fine bread crumbs, then in beaten tgg, and again in bread 
crumbs, then in beaten Qgg, and again in bread crumbs. Arrange 
in frying basket so they do not touch each other and plunge in a 
kettle of boiling fat. Cook until a delicate brown and serve with 
tartare sauce. 

Fried Scallops, No. 2. — Wipe dry ; dip separately into 
seasoned tgg, then into cracker dust, and fry in hot lard. 

Scallops in Batter. — Wash and dry large scallops. Dip 
each in fritter batter (see Fritters) and fry golden brown in 
smoking-hot fat. 

Scallop Fritters. — VVash and drain one quart of scallops, 
season them with salt and white pepper, and mix them with the 



SCALLOPS. 129 

following batter : one pint of sifted flour, a scant half-pint of milk, 
one tablespoonful of melted butter or oil, one teaspoonful of salt, 
and two eggs. Beat the eggs briskly, then add the milk. Beat 
again and pour the mixture on the flour. Then add the butter 
and salt. Stir in the scallops. Drop a spoonful at a time of the 
mixture into boiling fat. Cook until a nice brown. Drain on 
brown paper and serve very hot. 

Scallops in Shell. — Drain a pint of them and toss them with 
a tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan, letting them brown lightly 
for about ten minutes. Then take them out and chop them fine. 
Melt a spoonful of butter in a saucepan, add a small onion minced 
fine and brown it lightly. Then add a heaping teaspoonful of 
flour and stir in slowly a cup of liquor drained from the scallops. 
Season with a teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of cayenne, and a little 
white pepper. Mix with the chopped scallops four tablespoon- 
fuls of bread crumbs and yolks of three eggs, and cook all 
together for three minutes. Then fill the shells, sprinkle fine 
bread crumbs over the top and dot with bits of butter, and set 
them in a hot oven to brown for ten minutes. Serve them on 
platter with green garnish. 

Scallops with Tartare Sauce. — Dry scallops after washing, 
then roll in cracker dust, afterward in tgg and crumbs and drop 
them into boiling fat for a minute, so they will take on a light 
brown. The crumbs must have salt and pepper mixed with them. 

Tartare Sauce. — One-half cup of mayonnaise dressing, six 
small sour pickles, one quarter bottle of capers, one hard-boiled 
egg, one medium-sized raw onion, a little green parsley. Chop 
all together very fine and mix with the mayonnaise dressing.

LOBSTERS. 

The markets are supplied with these deUcious shell fish, and 
they may be obtained in good condition all the year. The 
canned lobster is also convenient in an emergency, for use in 
soups and salads. Lobsters are put alive into boiling salt water, 
and cooked twenty minutes from the time the water boils. They 
should not be eaten until cold, and never be kept more than 
eighteen hours after boiling. Lobsters are difficult of digestion, 
and should be eaten with mustard, cayenne pepper, and lemon 
juice or vinegar. 

When freshly boiled they are stiff, and their tails turn strongly 
inward ; when the fish appear soft and watery, they are stale. 
The flesh of the male lobster is generally considered of the finest 
flavor for eating, but the hen lobster is preferred for sauce and 
soups, on account of the coral. 

BE SURE LN ALL CASES TO REMOVE INTESTINAL 
CORD (BLACK CORD FOUND IN CENTRE OF BACK 
RUNNING FROM BODY TO END OF TAIL). 

Boiled Lobster. — To properly boil lobsters, throw them 
living into a kettle of fast-boiling salt and water, that life may be 
destroyed in an instant. Let them boil for about half an hour. 
When done, take them out of the kettle, wipe them clean, and 
rub the shell with a little salad oil, which will give them a clear 
red appearance. Crack the large claws without mashing them, 
and with a sharp knife split the body and tail from end to end. 
The head, which is never eaten, should also be separated from 
the body, but laid so near it that the division is almost imper- 
ceptible. Dress in any way preferred. 

To Open a Boiled Lobster. — Wipe off shell, break off 
large claws ; separate tail from body ; take body from shell, 
leaving " lady," or stomach, on shell. Put aside green fat and 
coral ; remove small claws ; remove woolly gills from body, break 
latter through middle, and pick out meat from joints. Crush or 
cut under side of tail, draw meat from shell. Draw back flesh 
on upper end and PULL OFF INTESTINAL CORD FOUND 
IN CENTRE OF BACK. Break edge of large claws and 
remove meat. 

Broiled Lobster with Sauce. — Select as many chicken 
female lobsters as desired. Split them open and remove all the 



LOBSTERS. 131 

fat and coral. Set aside for the sauce. Brush the meat of the 
lobster with melted butter, and broil over a clear fire. When 
cooked, place on a platter and pour a little melted butter over 
each lobster. Set in oven for five minutes, then serve with the 
following sauce : 

Sauce for Broiled Lobster : The quantity of sauce depends 
upon the number of lobsters you have. Mix salt, white pepper, 
oil, and vinegar, the same as for a plain French dressing, but do 
not have it quite as strong of the vinegar. Add dry mustard to 
taste, and the coral and fat of the lobster. Stir constantly over 
the fire until it comes to a boil. When, served it should be as 
thick as a cream. 

Lobster a la Brooklyn with Sauce and Hominy 
Croustade. — Cook two medium -sized lobsters in court bouillon 
for twenty-five minutes. When cold, cut the shell with sharp 
scissors, from the head down, taking care not to crack the shell. 
Have the head and shell joined. Take out the tail and remove 
the small black vein which runs the entire length. Also remove 
the small sac at the extreme end. Crack the claws carefully. 
Take the meat and fat from head and be sure to remove " the 
lady in the lobster." Remove the coral — should there be any — 
and set aside for further use. Place the shells and claws in cold 
water, and make the following forcemeat : Put the lobster 
through a meat machine. To every cup of lobster havr one-half 
cup of bread crumbs, grated very fine, two tablespoonfuls of 
white sauce, half a cup of cream, one sherry glass of Madeira 
wine, and salt and white pepper to taste. Mix all together 
thoroughly. Fill the shells, dust over with bread crumbs and 
minute pieces of butter. Bake in moderate oven until a deli- 
cate brown. Place on a croustade of hominy, garnish with the 
claws, and serve with sauce made as follows : 

Sauce for Lobster a la Brooklyn : Melt one ounce butter, 
add one tablespoonful of chopped onion, and cook for five 
minutes. Do not let the mixture brown. Stir in one table- 
spoonful flour and cook for two minutes. Add half a pint of 
white stock and cook until it thickens. Remove and strain 
through a fine sieve. Season to taste and add two wineglasses of 
Sherry. Serve very hot.

and one-half pounds each with boiling water. Add one table- 
spoonful of salt, one head of celery, one small bouquet, half an 
onion, and six whole peppers. Cook until the lobsters' claws can 
easily be pulled apart — it will probably take twenty minutes. 
When cool enough to handle, cut the lobster down the back and 
remove the meat from the body and claws. Save the coral and the 
green fat. Put back all the tough part of the small claws and 
shells, and cook them for twenty minutes in the same liquor. 
The liquor must be considerably reduced. Dry the coral, then 
rub it through a sieve. In a saucepan mix one tablespoonful of 
butter with one ounce of flour. When it comes to a boil, stir in 
one quart of hot milk. Let this come to a boil. Then add one 
pint of the lobster broth. This must come to a boil. Then season

slices. Let this cook a minute or two, then stir in one pint of 
stock, a little salt, and juice of one lemon, and one tablespoonful 
of curry dissolved in a little cold water. Boil all together until 
the mixture thickens, then add the lobster. Have it thoroughly 
heated, and serve at once with boiled rice in a separate dish. 

Lobster Cutlets. — Pass the meat from a large lobster through 
a mincing machine. Place it in a stew-pan and moisten gener- 
ously with curry sauce. Let it simmer, stirring frequently, for 
one-half hour. The sauce should be absorbed. Remove from 
the fire, stir in two eggs, and pour on a flat dish, as deep as you 
wish your cutlets thick. When cold, form into cutlets with a 
medium-sized cutter, flour them lightly, dip them in beaten egg, 
and cover them thickly with fine sifted bread crumbs. Set the 
cutlets in a cool place for half an hour and then fry in deep boil- 
ing fat. Drain on paper. Garnish each one with a small claw 
and serve.

poach in the oven until firm to the touch. Serve with Bechamel 
sauce, or any other desired. 

Lobster on Toast. — Remove the meat from a good-sized 
lobster and cut in small pieces ; put in the chafing-dish one-half 
cup hot water, one tablespoonful vinegar, one-half teaspoonful 
salt, two tablespoonfuls butter, and dash cayenne, and let it 
boil ; then add the lobster and simmer for five minutes ; serve 
on buttered toast. 

Hominy Croustade. — Place one cup of hominy, one

on platter it is to be served on. When it is to be warmed, stand 
the dish over a pan of hot water.

CRABS. 

These are found near the coast of the Southern and Middle 
States, and are considered such a luxury in Maryland that special 
means are taken for their propagation. They are usually quite 
expensive in Eastern markets. Crabs, like lobsters, shed their 
shell annually. When the new shell is forming, they are called 
soft-shell crabs, and are highly esteemed by epicures. 

The same general rules for inspection as in lobsters. 

Crab Bisque, No. 1 . — Twelve large, hard-shell crabs boiled 
in salted water. The female crab, known by the light red claws 
and large flap, is the best. Drain, remove the large shell, but 
save the creamy part that sticks to it. Put this with the coral 
that is in the crab, pound fine with four ounces of butter and the 
yolks of four eggs, and rub through a sieve. Pare off the flaps 
and gills, wash ofi' the sand, and pound what is left of the crab 
to a puree. Chop a medium-sized onion, put it in a saucepan 
with four ounces of butter, fry a minute or two, then add one 
pound of steeped and pressed white bread and the crab 
puree. Stir the whole to a paste and gradually stir in one-half 
pint Catawba wine and enough white broth to make it of the right 
consistency. Add a bouquet and boil all for one-half hour. Rub 
through a fine hair sieve, stir and boil again. Add the prepared 
egg yolks, white pepper and a pinch of cayenne, one-half pint 
boiling cream. Mix well without boiling and pour into a tureen. 
If possible, serve with small boiled oyster crabs separately on a 
plate. 

Crab Bisque, No. 2. — For eight persons use eighteen large, 
hard-shell crabs, one quart of chicken or veal stock, one quart of 
cream, one pint of stale bread free of crust, two tablespoonfuls 
of butter, one of flour, one small slice of carrot, one large slice 
of onion, two bay leaves, one stalk of celery, one sprig of 
parsley, a bit of mace, slight grating of nutmeg, one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of white pepper, dash of cayenne, and three teaspoon- 
fuls of salt. Put one-half the meat of the crabs and all of the 
claws into a stew-pan. Add the spice, vegetables, herbs, and half 
the stock, and place the pan where its contents will simmer gently 
for forty minutes. Ten minutes later put the bread and the 
remaining stock into another stew-pan, and set the pan where its 



CRABS. 141 

contents will simmer gently for thirty minutes. When the first 
mixture has cooked for the proper period, strain it over that in the 
second stew-pan. Mix all these ingredients thoroughly and rub 
through a fine sieve. Return to the fire and add butter and flour 
which have been rubbed together. Cook five minutes longer and 
add the cream heated in a double boiler, the remainder of the 
crab meat, salt and pepper. Let the soup boil up once and serve. 
If one chooses, one tablespoonful of brandy and three of Sherry 
may be added after the bisque is taken from the stove. 

Crab Canapes. — Remove all the meat from eighteen hard- 
shell boiled crabs. Place on a plate, season with a teaspoonful 
of salt and half a saltspoonful of cayenne. Fry one finely 
chopped onion in one ounce of butter over a moderate fire for 
about two minutes, add two tablespoonfuls of flour, and cook two 
minutes more, then pour in one gill of broth and cook slowly for 
five minutes. Stir all the time it is cooking Add the crab meat 
and cook all for fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove 
and set away to cool. Mix one tablespoonful of butter and one 
tablespoonful of flour and cook over a moderate heat for three 
minutes. Add two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese and two 
ounces of Swiss cheese, stirring them well together until melted. 
While it is cooling, cut six good-sized slices of bread about one- 
quarter of an inch thick, trim off the crust and fry, until a light 
brown, in a little fresh butter. When cool, spread each slice 
with a layer of crab meat about one-quarter of an inch thick. 
Divide the cheese mixture in six equal portions. Shape each 
into a ball and place in the centre of the crab meat. Put all in 
a dish and bake in a hot oven for five or six minutes. Serve in 
the same dish they were in while cooking. 

Deviled Crabs, No. 1 . — One dozen fresh crabs boiled 
and pickled ; quarter of a pound of fresh butter, one small 
teaspoonful of mustard powder, cayenne pepper and salt to taste. 
Put the meat into a bowl and mix carefully with it an equal 
quantity of fine bread crumbs. Work the butter to a light cream, 
mix the mustard well with it, then stir in very carefully, a handful 
at a time, the mixed crabs and crumbs. Season to taste with 
cayenne pepper and salt, fill the crab shells with the mixture, 
sprinkle bread crumbs over the tops, put three small pieces of 
butter upon the top of each, and brown them quickly in a hot 
oven. They will puff in baking and will be found to be very 
nice. 



142 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD, 

Deviled Crabs, No. 2. — One cup crab meat, picked from 
shells of well-boiled crabs, two tablespoonfuls fine bread crumbs 
or rolled cracker, yolks two hard-boiled eggs chopped, juice of a 
lemon, one-half teaspoonful mustard, a little cayenne pepper and 
salt, one cup good drawn butter. Mix one spoonful crumbs with 
chopped crab meat, yolks, seasoning, drawn butter Fill scallop 
shells — large clam shells will do — or small pat6-pans — with 
the mixture ; sift crumbs over top, heat to slight browning in 
quick oven. 

Crab Farcie with Tomato Sauce. — Take the meat of 
two crabs to every shell and mix with two and one-half medium- 
sized slices of bread which have been soaked in bouillon. (Water 
will do if you have no bouillon.) Press out dry and add one 
tablespoonful of melted butter, one teaspoonful of dry mustard. 
Pepper and salt to taste and moisten all with one-half cup of 
tomato sauce. 

Gumbo of Crabs. — Take eight large, soft-shell crabs, clean 
them, and pare off the small legs, flaps, and gills which are 
spongy and generally sandy. Wash, drain well, and cut each 
crab in about eight pieces. Put in a saucepan two ounces butter, 
two chopped shallots, and two ounces of ham cut very small. 
Fry a little, add one-half pint of white wine, five pints of white 
broth, salt, pepper, one bunch of parsley tied up with one bay 
leaf, one sprig of thyme, one clove of garlic, two cloves, one-half 
a green pepper without the seeds and cut small, and finally the 
crabs. Cover, and boil slowly for one hour. Remove the parsley, 
skim the fat, and add six tablespoonfuls of gumbo powder. Drop 
the powder by the left hand quite a distance from the liquid, all 
the time stirring with the right hand. This prevents it from 
getting lumpy. Season highly, pour into a soup tureen, and serve 
with plain boiled rice on a separate dish. 

Scalloped Crabs. — Put the crabs into a kettle of boiling 
water, and throw in a handful of salt. Boil from twenty minutes 
to a half an hour. Take them from the water when done and 
pick out all the meat ; be careful not to break the shell. To a 
pint of meat put a little salt and pepper ; taste, and if not enough 
add more, a little at a time till suited. Grate a very little nutmeg, 
and add one spoonful of cracker or bread crumbs, two eggs well 
beaten, and two tablespoonfuls of butter (even full) , stir all 



CRABS. 143 

well together; wash the shells clean, and fill each shell full of the 
mixture ; sprinkle crumbs over the top and moisten with butter, 
then bake until nicely browned on top. 

Soft-shell Crabs, No. 1. — Lift each point of the back 
shell and remove the spongy substance found beneath it, taking 
care to scrape and cut away every bit. Turn the crab on its 
back and remove the semi-circular piece of dark, soft shell called 
the ''apron" or "flap " and more of the same spongy substance 
lying under it. Wash in cold water and dry carefully on a towel. 
Season with salt and pepper, dip in egg and roll in crumbs. Fry 
about three minutes in very hot fat, putting in only two at a time, 
as they should be ice-cold when prepared. Serve with tartare 
sauce. Some people like them seasoned only with flour, but 
most people enjoy the crisp and savory crumbs. 

Soft-shell Crabs, No. 2. — Season with pepper and salt; 
roll in flour, then in egg, then in bread crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard. Serve hot with rich condiments. 

Fried Soft-shell Crabs, No. 3. — After cleaning the desired 
number of crabs, season with salt and pepper, dip in beaten egg, 
then in fine bread crumbs. Drop in hot fat and cook until 
crisp and colored a nice brown. Drain and place on hot dish, 
garnish with sliced lemon and parsley. Serve with tartare sauce 
or any fried fish sauce desired. 

Timbale of Crabs. — Cook one dozen hard-shell crabs in 
boiling water with one onion, a bunch of parsley, a head of 
lettuce, six peppercorns, blade of mace, two cloves, one bay leaf, 
and one tablespoonful of salt for ten minutes. Do not boil hard 
as it toughens the meat. Remove the crabs and set them on a 
wooden dish to cool. Pick out the meat from the body and 
claws. Pound well in mortar and rub through puree sieve. 
Measure your crab meat. There should be one-half pint, good 
measure. Mix with the meat the well-beaten whites of two eggs. 
Set away in cool place. 

Make the following sauce : One tablespoonful of butter and 
one of flour. Let them come to a boil. Add one-half cup of 
milk and one-half cup of liquor the crabs were cooked in, one- 
half teaspoonful salt, one-fourth teaspoonful white pepper, a good 
pinch of cayenne. Cook for a few minutes, then stir in the 
yolks of two eggs, and set away to cool. When cold, add the 



144 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

sauce to the fish with half a cup of whipped cream, measured 
after the cream is whipped. Set on ice for a few minutes. 
Decorate some small timbale molds with lobster coral or truffles. 
Put your forcemeat in, giving it a few knocks on the table to 
settle forcemeat. Set in ice-box for half an hour. Place the 
mold in a pan of hot water and cook in the oven for fifteen or 
twenty minutes or until the forcemeat is firm. Unmold each 
timbale on a round piece of toast and garnish with the claws 
and parsley. Put a tablespoonful of Bechamel sauce on each 
mold and serve the rest in a sauce-boat. 

White House Canapes. — Chop a medium-sized shallot and 
fry it lightly without coloring in two ounces of butter. Add a 
tablespoonful of flour and stir in a pint of cream. Then add 
one pound of crab meat, salt and pepper, and leave on the fire 
until it has just begun to bubble. Cut slices of bread one- 
quarter of an inch thick, trim in any desired shape, either round, 
oval, or square, and toast on one side only. Put your ingredi- 
ents on the toasted side of the bread after buttering it with a 
butter prepared as follows : Mix well together one- quarter of a 
pound of butter and one-half pound grated Parmesan cheese, 
and season with red and white pepper. Put the canapes on a 
buttered dish and slightly brown in the oven. 



SHRIMPS. 145 



SHRIMPS. 

Shrimps and prawns are found in the summer season on the 
Southern coasts. They are similar in form to a lobster, but very 
small. They should be cooked in boiling salted water from five 
to eight minutes. Remove the shells and head ; the part that is 
eaten resembles in shape the tail of a lobster. They are used in 
fish sauces, and are very effective as a garnish. 

Shrimp are caught in immense quantities along the seashore 
from early spring till late autumn, but are chiefly used for bait 
and for lunches for the parties of children who have unlimited 
time to pick them from their paper-like shells. If one can take 
the trouble to pick them out they are really more delicate in fibre 
and finer flavored than their larger cousins from the gulf. The 
dainty pink morsels make an appropriate and appetizing garnish 
for boiled fish of all kinds, and added to any sauce for fish they 
are more satisfactory than lobster, whose coarser flavor often 
dominates the fish it is intended to complement. As a curry, or 
deviled or salad, or in a bisque, they are always good. They 
may be prepared by any of the formulas already given for lobsters 
or crabs, remembering that the seasoning should be less heavy as 
the flavor of shrimp is more delicate. Tinned shrimps should 
always be rinsed in lightly salted water and well drained and aired 
before they are used. 

Cosmos Club Shrimps. — One tablespoonful each of butter 
and flour creamed. Put in one teacup of sweet cream, add a 
pinch of red pepper, a little lemon juice and enough tomato sauce 
to make it the color of shrimps. Put into the chafing-dish and 
let come to a boil. Add half a pound of shrimps and let boil up 
once. Serve on hot, buttered crackers. 

Creamed Shrimps. — The yolks of two eggs, one teaspoon- 
ful of anchovy sauce, half a cup of cream, one bottle of shrimps, 
some slices of toast. Mix in the chafing-dish the yolks of the 
eggs with the anchovy sauce and cream. Put in the shrimps and 
let them get thoroughly heated, not allowing the eggs to curdle. 
Serve on strips of toast. 

Creamed Shrimps Baked with Green Peppers. — Select 
twelve even-sized green peppers, remove the stems and seeds, and 



146 RECIPES FOR SEA FOOD. 

soak in cold water for three-quarters of an hour. Drain them 
and stuff with the following mixture : Cream two tablespoonfuls 
of butter and thoroughly mix it with a quarter of a teaspoonful of 
pepper, one teaspoonful of mixed mustard, one- eighth of a tea- 
spoonful of celery seed, and one beaten Qgg. When mixed stir 
in one cup of fine bread crumbs. Then add one quart of shrimps. 
Should the shrimps be fresh — not canned ones — you will need 
to season the sauce with salt. Fill each pepper with the mixture, 
sprinkle with fine bread crumbs and a piece of butter, and bake 
in quick oven for fifteen minutes. 

Canapes a la Prince of Wales. — Take six prawns, six fil- 
lets of anchovy, one head of white celery, two gherkins, and two 
truffles. Cut all into small square pieces about the size of a large 
pea. Put them into a bowl with enough Prince of Wales sauce 
to season them thoroughly. Pour nice clear aspic jelly in the 
bottom of some china cases, then put in the mixtures. Pour 
some more jelly on the top and set it aside to jell. When wanted, 
unmold on a platter which has nice white lettuce leaves around 
the edge. Set individual molds in the centre and garnish with 
chopped aspic. 

Curried Shrimps. — Chop fine one small onion and cook 
until yellow in one and one-half tablespoonfuls butter ; add one 
and one-half tablespoonfuls flour and one-third teaspoonful curry 
powder ; when smooth add one and one-half cups stewed and 
strained tomato and one can shrimps broken in pieces. Season 
with salt and pepper or paprika and serve on crackers or toast. 

Dunbar Shrimps. — Put a big lump of butter in the pan 
with salt, cayenne, one and one-half teaspoonfuls of table sauce 
and two cups of cream, when hot add two hard-boiled eggs 
chopped fine and one pint of shrimps chopped fine ; let come 
to a boil. Serve on hot dainty potato chips or toast. 

Japanese Shrimps. — Put a pint of milk in the dish over the 
hot water pan, when it boils add two tablespoonfuls each of butter 
and flour creamed and stir till thick, add one cup of strained 
tomatoes, one-quarter teaspoonful of soda, seasoning, and last the 
picked shrimps. Serve on toast. 

Shrimp and Peas. — Melt four tablespoonfuls butter, and 
add three tablespoonfuls flour mixed with one-half teaspoonful 



SHRIMPS. 147 

salt and one-eighth teaspoonful pepper ; pour on gradually one 
and one-half cups milk ; as soon as sauce thickens add one can 
shrimp broken in pieces and one can of canned peas, drained 
from their liquor and thoroughly rinsed. 

Shrimp Salad. — Take one can of shrimps, take one bunch 
of lettuce and two stalks of celery, cut up fine, add half a cup of 
salad cream and mix thoroughly together ; pour a little more 
dressing over the top ; garnish edge of platter with pickled beets 
and lettuce leaves ; sprinkle over with chopped parsley and 
serve.

PREPARING WACHUSETT HADDIES 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

Wachusett Iladdies, being only slightly salted before being 
smoked, need no soaking. Simply wash in lukewarm water, trim 
off tail and fins, lay the fish in a large shallow pan, cover with 
boiling water and keep it at just below the boiling point for about 
fifteen minutes, or until the tiakes are white and cooked. 

If boiled rapidly, or cooked too long it will be hard and dry. 
Drain, remove the skin and large or back-bone and unless to be 
served whole remove the fine bones also and separate into its 
natural flakes. 

If the fish is to be served plain, simply heat again after a slight 
scalding in hot water or milk to moisten, add butter, pepper and 
lemon juice and serve. 



WACHUSETT HADDIE SALAD 

After scalding the Iladdie cool it and separate into flakes. Use 
equal parts of thinly sliced cold boiled potatoes and the flaked 
Haddie and dress it to taste with salt, pepper, olive oil and tarragon 
vinegar ; or use any preferred mayonnaise dressing. 



CREAMED WACHUSETT HADDIE 

FOB THE CHAFING DISH 

Wash, scald, trim and flake, or use any remnants of broiled or 
baked Haddie. For one cup of fish flaked, allow one cup of white 
sauce. 

Melt one rounded tablespoon of butter in a small saucepan, or 
in the blazer of the chafing dish, stir in one rounded tablespoon of flour 
and add gradually one cup of hot milk (or use half milk and half 
strained tomato, or use thin cream). 

Stir till thick and smooth, add one-fourth teaspoon salt and a 
dash of cayenne and one teaspoon of lemon juice. Add the flaked 
fish and when hot serve on toast or with baked potatoes ; or pvit the 
mixture in a baking dish, or in ramekins, cover with buttered 
cracker crumbs and bake till brown. 

To vary this method, cook one teaspoon each of minced onion 
and sweet green pepper (or the canned red pimento) in the butter 
before adding the flour. Or add one beaten egg to the sauce just 
before serving, cookino^ it only enouofh lonofer to set the eofff, and 
serve like picked up Codfish„ Or add one-fourth cup of grated 
cheese to the sauce to make up for the smaller amount of nutriment 
in the fish when dried. 



WACHUSETT HADDIE IN GREEN 
PEPPERS 

Cook one teaspoon of minced onions in a rounded tablespoon of 
hot butter, slowly, till cooked but not browned ; add one tablespoon 
of fluur, mix, then stir in gradually one-half cup each of thin hot 
cream and strained tomato, add one-fourth teaspoon of salt, stir in 
one cup of scalded and flaked Haddie. Divide three sweet green 
peppers from stem to small end making boat shapes ; remove seeds 
and white fibre and fill with the mixture, cover with cracker crumbs 
moistened in melted butter, put them in a shallow pan close 
together and half cover with hot water, add one tablespoon of butter 
to the water and bake about twenty minutes or till brown. 



WACHUSETT HADDIE— Scorched or Toasted 

As a relish for supper, a bit of scalded and drained Haddie may 
be slightly toasted over gas, or laid directly on the hot coals for a 
minute's browning, or quickly browned in hot butter, in the chafing 
dish. 



WACHUSETT HADDIE -Baked 

Wash, scald, trim, remove skin and bone if you like, but leave 
the fish whole. 

Lay it in a shallow baking-pan and nearly cover with milk. 
Bake about twenty minutes, basting frequently with the milk. If 
liked richer use thin cream and cover the fish with a sprinkling of 
minced onion, sweet green pepper and tomatoes, then with cracker 
crumbs, and bake until well browned. 



WACHUSETT HADDIE a la Tarragona 

Prepare one cup of scalded and flaked Haddie, saute it in one 
rounded tablespoon of butter in the blazer, add a dash of cayenne 
and one tablespoon of tarragon vinegar and stir while it heats. 
Dilute one beaten egg with one cup of hot thin cream and after 
setting the blazer over the hot water pan to prevent tne egg curdling 
stir in the mixture and cook until the egg is set, stirring constantly, 
salt to taste and serve at once. If you approve of using sherry 
instead of the vinegar the dish may be called a la Newburgh. 



WACHUSETT HADDIE — Broiled 

Wash, scald, trim, drain and wipe dry. Remove the large 
bone, keeping the fish whole if possible. Spread generously with 
softened butter and lay it on a wire broiler well greased with a bit 
of pork rind. Broil flesh side first, for about five to eight minutes, 
then brown the skin side until slightly scorched. Scrape off the 
skin, turn the fish onto a hot platter and moisten slightly with hot 
water or milk, and butter ; or with thin cream. Add lemon juice 
and pepper if liked. 

Haddock being in its fresh state a dry fish, with no fat, needs 
after curing a rich sauce or a generous moistening with milk and 
butter, or cream to make it at its best, especially when it is to be 
broiled, as this method often makes the fish still more dry. 



WACHUSETT HADDIE SALAD No. 2 

Take equal parts of finely minced cucumbers and prepared 
Haddie, moisten with mayonnaise dressing and serve in a tomato 
cup on a bed of lettuce. 




How Finnan Haddies Originated 



S8KS 



A DISCUSSION on the merits of food fishes among a party 
of men in Boston, and the diflference between the flavor of 
the Scotch and American finnan-haddie, writes Col. Robert 
]\Iitchell Floyd, brought out an exclamation from an 
Americanized Scottish Highlander. "Mon! Mon!" he 
exclaimed, "but do you know how the findon-haddie happened to 
be?" We admitted our ignorance. "Many years ago at a seaport 
town on the North Sea, Port Lethen, a fire occurred in one of the 
fish-curing houses, and partially burned the end of the structure, 
which was piled full of lightly salted, freshly caught Haddock, which 
were lying on beds of dry kelp." 

"After the flames were extinguished and the charred top and side 
of one of the piles of fish were removed, the Maister pulled out one 
of the slightly smoked Haddock, still w^ann from the heat. He smelt 
it, wiiile the curious group of his men around him watched his every 
move ; he tore off a piece of the fish, and tasting it, took another bit, 
sagely nodded his head, and passed it over to the foreman, Sandy, saying, 
' Taste you it, Sandy ! It is nae so nasty. ' This proved to be a great 
day in Port Lethen, for every fisherman in the town had a Haddie 
given him free of cost that had been cured by the smoke from the 
burning kelp, and from that time until the present no one in Port 
Lethen, or the greater fishing village a mile away, Findon, ever cured 
a Haddock except by smoking them over the burning seaweed." 

The cleverness of the Findon fish dealers in being the first to put 
this new cured Haddie on the market won for them the glory of the 
trade name "findon haddie," which was abbreviated later on into 
' ' finnan-haddie. ' '
