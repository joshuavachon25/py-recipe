CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER. 



This disease has occurred at Salon ica within recent years. In 
hot, dry and sandy countries it is apt to appear in the season when 
dust-storms are prevalent. 
Etiology. 

The causal micro-organism is the Gram-negative Diplococcus 
intracellularis of Weichselbauin found in the cerebro-spinal fluid 
and meninges of persons suffering from the disease. It has been 
isolated from the blood and from the nasal and lachrymal secretions 
and is frequently demonstrable in the throat secretions 
of contact cases. It would seem that the healthy " carrier " is the 
chief source of infection and, harbouring the meningococcus in 
his throat, he distributes it when he coughs, spits or sneezes. 
Infected fomites, such as handkerchiefs, etc., may play a part and 
it is possible that food may become contaminated and infection 
take place through the gastro-intestinal tract. The general view 
is that it enters the brain either via the lymphatics through the 
cribriform plate of the ethmoid or the sphenoidal sinuses, or 
reaches brain or spinal cord by the blood through the respiratory 



Observations on a regimental epidemic showed that : 

1. There are many more contacts than actual cases. 

2. The cocci usually disappear quickly from the naso-pharyngeal 

mucus but may persist for 4 weeks. 

3. They are most numerous and virulent during their first week 

of residence in the throat. 

4. They are little resistant to the sun's rays. 

The prevalence of naso-pharyngeal catarrh favours infection and 
so do over-fatigue, over-crowding and bad ventilation. It is 
conceivable that under war conditions flies might spread 
infection. The whole of the " carrier " question is still subjudice. 

Symptoms. 

Incubation period uncertain but probably less than 10 days. 
The onset is very sudden, so much so that the patient may rapidly 
lose consciousness. If he can walk his peculiar gait may betray 
him for he looks as if he were going to throw himself backwards. 
He complains of headache, stiffness in the neck and chilly 
sensations. There may be a rigor and vomiting and the tempera- 
ture is raised. The face is flushed, the mind confused, the patient 
possibly delirious. Extraction of the head is marked. It may be 
difficult to bend it forward. Herpes on the lips or elsewhere is 
common. The tongue is dry and furred. Strabismus may be 
noted and photophobia is frequent. The presence of Kernig's sign 
is a great help in diagnosis for it is rarely absent. Petechiae, a 
patchy erythema and purpuric blotches appear on the skin in some 
(B 5057) A 2 



of the more severe cases hence the name " Spotted Fever " but 
the exanthem is not very frequently seen. It may be in the form 
of pink spots like those of typhoid but not raised. Look for these 
on the back and about the joints. Lumbar puncture shows an 
opalescent, milky spinal fluid which contains the organism. In 
bad cases the delirium may be violent and if the patient is going 
to die respiration becomes laboured, the face cyanosed, and a 
purulent discharge pours from the nostrils. The termination is by 
hyperpyrexia or sudden collapse. Symptoms often vary greatly 
from day to day and hence the prognosis must be guarded. Cases 
may recover completely or pass into the chronic wasting stage 
which will not be here considered. 

There are ambulant, abortive, septicasmic and fulminant types. 
The two former are apt to escape detection. Relapses are apt to 
occur. 

Complications. 

Inflammatory conditions of the eye and ear are the most 
important. Acute nephritis must also be mentioned. 

Diagnosis. 

The bacteriological diagnosis of the spinal fluid is very important. 
The technique for lumbar puncture is as follows : Patient on side 
near edge of bed, knees well drawn up, head and shoulders thrown 
forward. See that there is a good light on the back and that no 
shadow falls on the operator's hand. After painting the skin 
patch with iodine and steadying the patient, thrust a long, 
sterilized needle with large bore into the inter vertebral space 
which is on a level with a line touching the summits of the iliac 
crests and is between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebra^. Fig. 1. 
It should be entered about three-eights of an inch to the right or left 
of the middle line and directed upwards and inwards. Puncture 
can also be made in the middle line, the needle pointing slightly 
upwards. The canal is reached at a depth of from one to three 
inches. According to the amount of intra-spinal pressure the 
fluid will exude in drops or in a continuous stream. It is turbid 
in the acute stage. Care must be taken that it does not squirt on 
to attendants. 

If the fluid does not flow the patient may be asked to cough as 
this will sometimes start its expulsion. It may be allowed to 
escape till the rate of flow is about one drop to each 3 or 4 seconds. 
A blood examination will show polyrnorphonuclear leucocytosis. 

Differential Diagnosis. 

In the Mediterranean war area distinguish especially from typhus 
fever, relapsing fever, malaria, typhoid fever, rheumatic fever, 
influenza and heat-stroke. Other diseases to be borne in mind 
are plague, early small-pox, a certain form of scarlet fever with 
nervous manifestations, meningitis due to pneumococcal infection, 
chronic nephritis with uraemia, acute mania, acute irritant poison- 
ing and hysteria simulating meningitis. 



Prophylaxis. 

Avoid unnecessary fatigue and guard against overcrowding, 
faulty ventilation of quarters and barracks and the conditions 
giving rise to nasopharyngeal catarrh. It is probably advisable to 
destroy foodstuffs found in infected premises and to distribute 
formamint lozenges, if available, to those likely to be or to become 
carriers. Such men may also with advantage use a nasal wash of 
sodium salicylate, 10 grains to the ounce of water, night and 
morning. Actual carrier cases should be treated by being made to 
sniff up a solution of 1 in 1000 potassium permanganate plus 1-5 
per cent, sodium sulphate to assist penetration, or their naso- 
pharynx may be sprayed with a one per cent, solution of iodine 
combined with a two per cent, solution of menthol in paroleine. 
A swab of 3 per cent, iodine in glycerine can be used and an 
alternative method is that employed in the French army, the 
following mixture being prescribed for inhalation : 

Iodine ... ... ... 12 grammes. 

Guaiacol ... ... ... 2 

Thymol ... ... ... 25 centigrammes. 

Alcohol, 60 per cent. ... 200 grammes. 

NOTE. In order to dissolve the iodine, 6 grammes of iodide of 
potash should be added to the above. 

This mixture is put in a porcelain dish, which is floated in a 
basin of boiling water. The patient is directed to sit, with his 
head bent over this at a few inches distant and inhale the fumes, 
breathing slowly through each nostril ; the sitting should last for 
two or three minutes, and should be repeated five times in twenty- 
four hours. 

All cases of unaccountable headache, of apparent ptomaine 
poisoning, and of vomiting, with or without rise of temperature or 
pulse, as well as all cerebral cases, should be isolated and notified. 
When the patient is diagnosed to be suffering from epidemic cerebro- 
spinal meningitis he should be immediately sent to the isolation 
hospital, and not only his bedding but that of all his immediate 
neighbours and their blankets and clothing should be sent for 
disinfection. All the men sharing his room or hut should be 
isolated from the first and kept under special observation for signs 
of the disease, swabs being taken from them by an officer deputed 
for the purpose. Not until these swabs prove to be negative 
should the house or hut be "pronounced free from infection, until 
when no man in it should be allowed to return to duty. The 
isolation should be real, and the men drilled and paraded apart from 
the rest of their unit, and no direct inter-communication should be 
allowed between them and the cookhouse, while all feeding utensils 
should be swilled out with boiling water, and every man should 
use his own cups and plates. All waste matter should immediately 
be destroyed by fire, and special latrine arrangements made for 
the use of contacts. Systematic destruction of lice and fleas? 
should be undertaken, and samples of vermin collected alive for 
investigation. Further, provision should be made for the isolation 



of carriers, through whose instrumentality, it seems certain, some 
of the outbreaks have arisen. 

One may add that in the Mediterranean war area patients should 
be protected from flies by head nets or mosquito nets. 

In swabbing the throat the important thing is to get well in 
behind the soft palate. An ordinary diphtheria swab turned up at 
the end answers excellently. 



Treatment. 

Provided a reliable product can be obtained, and this is all- 
important, the intrathecal or, in septicamiic cases, intravenous 
injection of auti-meningococcic serum prepared according to 
Flexner's method is undoubtedly the best procedure. Puncture is 
performed in the manner already described but the patient's hips 
should be raised on a firm bolster or cushion and the foot of the 
bed elevated at least a foot. The ordinary injection syringe may 
be used with a piece of flexible rubber tubing interposed between 
the nozzle and the needle or the serum may be introduced by gravity 
by means of a funnel and rubber tube with a clip. The serum, 
which in all cases should be warmed to body-heat by immersion in 
hot water, is poured into the funnel arid tubing and the latter is 
then attached to the needle prior to loosening the clip. The 
maximum height to which the tube end of the funnel should be 
raised is 18 inches. 

Before injection a certain amount of spinal fluid is allowed to 
escape. Recent work seems to show that this should not exceed 
90 c.c. at any one time and the flow should be stopped if there is 
any indication of negative pressure being established. This loss 
of fluid is in itself often markedly beneficial but it is wise in all 
cases to give the serum. Hence replace the stylet in the needle 
until one is ready to inject the serum. A good plan is to measure 
the amount of fluid removed and then to replace it by a 
proportional quantity of serum. Thus if 60 c.c. of fluid is obtained 
40 c.c. of serum is given. The injection should be made very 
slowly and steadily, allowing at least one minute for each c.c. of 
serum injected. As a rule 20 to 30 c.c. are given as a first 
injection. Maintain the patient's position in bed for an hour after 
the administration. 

Local anaesthesia with ethyl chloride spray is usually considered 
sufficient for the operation but some recommend general anaesthesia 
where the patient is not unconscious, as sometimes both the 
withdrawal of fluid and the injection of serum occasion intense pain. 
If the spray is used the possibility of the needle getting choked by 
a plug of frozen skin must be borne in mind. Slight and careful 
suction with the syringe may sometimes be required to induce the 
spinal fluid to flow. If the patient is made to suck water through 
a straw during the operation the pain appears to be made more 
bearable and the patient less restless. Post-operative pain is best 
controlled by the local application of a hot poultice or fomentation. 



If signs of collapse ensue stop the injection. Should the temperature 
rise after the operation sponge the patient or cool him by cradling 
the bed-clothes. As a rule after the injection the restless patient 
becomes calm and may fall asleep. The question of repeating the 
injection must be determined by the gravity of the case. As a 
rule daily doses of 15 to 20 c.c. are given for 3 or 4 days, then after 
a three-days interval another injection is given and yet others if 
considered necessary. A good rough guide is the state of the 
spinal fluid. If it remains turbid it is well to give more serum. 
The real guide is the number of extracellular meningococci found. 
The persistence of Kernig's sign and continued spiking of the 
temperature are other indications. If on account of oedema the 
second puncture is found difficult it may be made in the space 
between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Fig. 1. 

Failing serum, soamiii may be given intramuscularly or 
intravenously. By the former route 5 grains is the usual initial 
dose, given for two days and then reduced to 3 grains every second 
day. For intravenous administration the dose is 3 grains. Vaccine 
therapy is on its trial. 

In all cases of cerebro- spinal fever the possibility of retention of 
urine must be borne in mind. The symptomatic treatment must 
not be neglected, such as hot baths for pain and restlessness, ice to 
the head or antipyrin, caffeine or aspirin for headache and valerian 
and the bromides for insomnia and delirium. Morphia is better 
avoided but may have to be given in cases of intense pain. The 
foul mouth should be treated in the manner described under 
Typhus Fever. A mixture of glycerine and lemon juice as an oral 
swab is grateful and comforting. 

Mercury and the iodides have been given on general principles.

CHOLERA. 



Happily at the time of writing no cases of cholera have been 
reported in the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and, although 
cholera, like other epidemic diseases, is apt in time of war to 
transgress the usual laws of epidemiology, it is unlikely that it 
will break out in the winter season. With the advent of warm 
weather, however, and the extension of the campaign to 
Bulgaria, it is more than likely that Asiatic cholera will appear 
in the war area. 

Cholera is caused by the comma-shaped, single-ciliated, Gram- 
negative vibrio of Koch, which lives, multiplies and produces 
an endotoxin in the small intestine. The cholera poison causes 
desquamation of the intestinal epithelium and the other mani- 
festations of the disease. 

Research work has shown that under war conditions the 
cholera "carrier" is undoubtedly the most important factor 
in spreading infection, but the role of water, food, fomites, 
flies and faulty conservancy methods must also be kept in mind. 
Vibrios have been found in the faeces of flies for 24-36 hours 
after ingestion of infected material by the insects. 

Cholera vibrios often disappear from the faeces of patients in 
3 or 4 days and rarely persist in them for longer than 20 days, 
but the healthy cholera carrier may go on passing vibrios for a 
period of 2 months, a gall bladder infection having become 
established. As a rule, however, the carrier only excretes vibrios 
for a week or ten days. An attack of diarrhoea or the adminis- 
tration of a purgative will often cause vibrios to appear in the 
stools of a carrier case and a purge may even excite an attack 
of cholera in a carrier. In India cholera vibrios have been known 
to live as long as 17 days in stools kept in the dark and with 
evaporation prevented. The average time of survival is shorter 
in hot weather in June 1-2 days, in February 7 '1 days (Greig). 

Symptoms. Incubation period a few hours to 5 days. 
Stages : Those of Evacuation, Algidity and Reaction. In a 
certain number of cases there is a premonitory diarrhoea, which 
is probably catarrhal in nature and may predispose to the 
choleraic attack. In other cases the stage of evacuation com- 
mences suddenly with profuse and frequent diarrhoea which may 
or may not be associated with colic. Indeed a sense of relief 
may accompany the passage of the stool. The motions, at first 
faeculent and bile-stained, quickly assume the typical rice-water 
appearance, there being small white flocculi of intestinal epithe- 
lium in a slightly opaque fluid. Pints of this material may pour 
from the patient, who rapidly becomes prostrated. He begins 



12 

to vomit and suffers greatly from thirst. The vomited matter 
which consists at first of food soon changes to rice-water fluid, 
and gushing from the mouth is apt to contaminate attendants. 
Cramps of the legs and abdomen set in, the tissues shrink, the 
eyes become sunken, the nose pinched, the skin cold and dusky 
or earthy in hue, the pulse feebler and the urine less. In the 
initial stages the brilliant white pearly colour of the eyelids, 
especially of the lower lid, makes the eyes appear large and 
bright. 

Algid Stage. The serious symptoms become intensified. 
The skin of the fingers shrivels (washerwoman's fingers) and 
the nails may become black. The voice is husky. The body 
surface is cold, livid and bedewed with a clammy sweat. The 
pulse at the wrist may almost vanish, and if a vein be incised 
only a drop of black and tarry blood may slowly exude. This con- 
centrated blood has a specific gravity of 1072 to 1078. The 
kidneys cease to act. The patient is restless, very thirsty and 
may or may not continue to be racked by cramps. While the 
surface temperature is low that of the rectum is often elevated. 

The mind is clear but the patient is apathetic. In fatal cases 
and usually some ten to twelve hours after the beginning of the 
attack coma supervenes, leading to death, but fatal collapse may 
occur much earlier or much later. The algid stage may ter- 
minate in recovery, the pulse returning at the wrist, the skin 
becoming warm, urine being secreted and .convalescence estab- 
lished in a short time. More frequently the patient enters 
upon the 

Stage of Reaction. The favourable symptoms just men- 
tioned appear and continue, the motions diminish and now 
contain bile. At the same time a febrile condition manifests 
itself, of which the sole indication may be a blood-shot state 
of the eyes. The febrile manifestation may be slight or severe 
and in the latter case a typhoidal condition may ensue, which 
may last as long as a fortnight. During this stage of reaction 
the patient may die from pneumonia, enteritis, diarrhoea, hyper- 
pyrexia or uroemic poisoning. 

Such is a picture of cholera gravis, but on the one hand mild 
ambulant cases occur where the carrier is a special danger, 
and on the other there is fulminating cholera in which toxaemia 
causes rapid death before vomiting or diarrhoea have time to 
set in. Of this nature is the so-called cholera sicca apt to 
occur amongst debilitated troops. In the late Balkan war rice- 
water stools were sometimes absent even in severe cases of 
cholera. 

Diagnosis. It is beyond the scope of this section to deal with 
the bacteriological diagnosis of cholera, but it is well to remind 
the medical officer that in the case of suspected carriers who 



13 

are constipated, rectal swabs should be sent to the nearest 
laboratory, while in the case of an autopsy on a suspected case 
of cholera 2 five-inch sections of the small intestine, one taken 
just above the ileo-caecal valve and the other from the middle 
of the ileum should be cut out after double ligaturing, placed 
in sterile, well-stoppered bottles and submitted to the bacterio- 
logist as quickly as possible. If culture media are available 
an agar or blood serum slant should be made from the material 
at the same time, as the vibrios are apt to be killed by the faecal 
bacteria. 

Convalescents from cholera may, it is stated, be recognised 
by the fact that they present an easily compressible pulse 
together with a black coating of the middle third of the posterior 
portion of the tongue. This is most marked about the 7th or 
8th day of convalescence and may aid in the detection of 
cholera cases. 

Differential Diagnosis. Many cases of cholera in the late 
Balkan war were diagnosed as bacillary dysentery, and it must 
be remembered that the serous form of the latter may closely 
simulate cholera. Further, recent work has shown that amoebic 
dysentery may sometimes do likewise. It is said that if 
dysentery coexists with cholera, cramps and rice-water stools 
may be absent. There is a form of pernicious malaria which 
presents choleraic symptoms, but the high axillary temperature 
should help to distinguish it from cholera. 

Severe diarrhoea of the cholera nostras form, ptomaine and 
mushroom poisoning, irritant metallic poisoning and the early 
stages of trichinosis need merely be mentioned. Note that in 
ptomaine poisoning the vomiting usually precedes the diarrhoea. 

Prophylaxis Personal. Anti-choleraic inoculations are now 
practised. These would seem not only to afford a considerable 
degree of protection but to lessen the risk of a fatal issue in 
the inoculated. The usual dose of the vaccine is 6,000 million 
bacilli given in two inoculations at 7 or 10 days interval, the 
first of 2,000 million in 0-5 c.c., the second of 4,000 million 
in 1 c.c. Where feasible a third dose of 1 c.c. may be given 
with advantage. The local reaction is very slight and there ^ is 
rarely any general disturbance. The duration of the immunity 
produced does not seem to be great and the inoculation should 
be repeated after the lapse of 4 months. 

Although some condemn the practice as being apt to upset 
the stomach, the use of lactic acid in tea or the addition of 30 
drops of dilute hydrochloric acid to every ounce of drinking 
water has much to commend it. The latter method has recently 
been used in India, to all appearance with great success. Ten 
drop doses of eucalyptus oil given twice daily have been 
strongly recommended. Give in mucilage and syrup of lemons. 



14 

When possible all indigestible diet should be avoided. 
Special care is needed as regards fruit and raw vegetables. 
Lettuces and celery being moist and eaten uncooked are 
specially dangerous. Vibrios have been found to survive on 
lettuce leaves for 29 days. Melons and cucumbers must be 
eschewed. 

Those who handle patients or corpses should wear india-rubber 
gloves, and doctors, nurses and orderlies should be provided 
with overalls and gum boots. In any case the careful disin- 
fection of the hands coupled with the use of a stout nail- 
brush is very important. The practice of hand-shaking should 
be discouraged during cholera epidemics. 

Prophylaxis General. Isolation of contacts and search for 
carriers, whether healthy or suffering from diarrhoea. In all 
cases more than one bacteriological examination of the stools 
should be made. Remember that the use of purgatives may 
induce cholera in a carrier case. Healthy carriers do not seem 
to be very dangerous. 

Cholera patients must be isolated and protected from flies. 
The closest attention must be paid to the minutiae of camp 
hygiene, especially the protection of food from flies, cock- 
roaches and ants. Food such as milk which has been sterilised 
may become infected after it has cooled. A strict supervision 
of cooks and cook-houses is essential. Indeed it would be well, 
where facilities exist, to have all cooks and handlers of food 
bacteriologically examined to see that they are not carriers. 
Certainly any suffering from diarrhoea should be so examined. 
Cook-houses and places where food is stored should be fre- 
quently cleansed with soda and hot water. 

The disinfection of pottery and table utensils is important. 
Pottery before being used may be washed in spirit and then 
sterilised by burning. Table utensils, when they cannot be 
boiled, may be immersed in a 20 per cent, solution of car- 
bonate of soda at a temperature of 50 C. or in alcohol at 
60 C. for half-an-hoiir. A careful eye should be kept on 
kitchen cloths of all kinds. They should be washed in perman- 
ganate solution. 

All water and milk should be boiled. Although there is no 
fault to be found with the method if properly carried out, 
chlorination of water is apt to be imperfectly performed, and 
hence in the presence of cholera it should not be relied upon by 
the individual. At the same time this process of water steriliza- 
tion should be continued and in many places it will be the 
only method available on a large scale. Its careful supervision 
is most necessary. The acid sulphate of soda tablets are quite 
efficient and may be safely used so long as they do not upset 
the digestion. The pocket "chlorine" outfit, if properly em- 



15 

ployed, will also render water safe, llernember that, just as in 
the case of milk, water may become contaminated after steriliza- 
tion. Hence, after boiling, it should be drunk as soon as it has 
cooled, unless indeed it is carried in a closed and properly disin- 
fected water bottle. Water bottles should be disinfected by per- 
manganate of potash and this should also be employed for the 
" pinking " of shallow wells, one ounce per 2,000 gallons of the 
well water being sufficient. 

Disinfect cholera stools by adding an equal amount of a 5 per 
cent, cresol solution and allowing it to remain in contact with 
the stool for at least one hour. Fresh chlorinated lime 1 lb. 
to 4 gallons may be used in the same way. Roughly 2 table- 
spoonfuls to the pint of cholera dejecta are required. 

Nothing is better than quicklime if it can be obtained. Add 
together equal parts of fresh quicklime and water. Dilute with 
three times as much water as previously used. Add a quantity 
of this slaked lime equal to the amount of stool to be disin- 
fected and allow to remain in contact for 1 hour. When 
ground has been fouled by dejecta or vomit disinfect with cresol 
or rake hot ashes over it or pour kerosene oil upon it and set the 
latter alight. 

Cholera-soiled clothing, bed linen and blankets should be 
stoved or soaked in a 2^- per cent, cresol solution. 

No washing must be allowed near wells and bathing-places 
require inspection and regulation. 

Treatment. For the most part drugs are of little use in 
cholera. The Indian practice is to treat the premonitory 
diarrhoea by giving half an ounce of castor oil with a teaspoonful 
of brandy. This is probably wise as it clears the bowel of irri- 
tating material. 

Five minim doses of dilute sulphuric acid in a tablespoonful 
of cinnamon water every quarter of an hour for 4 doses and 
then every hour may, after the initial castor oil, serve to check 
the diarrhosa. 

The symptomatic treatment is important. Even in the 
mildest cases absolute rest in bed is essential, a warmed bed- 
pan being provided. No food is to be given while the disease 
is active. The surface of the body must be kept warm. A hot 
mustard bath is indicated if the patient can stand it and should 
be followed by a vigorous rubbing down. Hot sand-bags to the 
body are useful and kneading of the muscles to relieve the 
intolerable cramps. When the latter become unbearable a whiff 
of chloroform may be given, and an arrangement can be made 
by means of a mask attached to a rubber band or elastic tape 
whereby the patient can administer the ansesthetic himself and 
yet remain safe as the mask is whisked away when he begins 
to become unconscious. 



16 

Ice and a small hypodermic of opium may check the vomit- 
ing, but it must be remembered when giving drugs subcu- 
taneously in cholera that they remain unabsorbed during the 
algid stage, and when the reaction sets in the drug or drugs which 
have been injected may be taken up in quantities which prove 
poisonous. Cocain or tincture of iodine may also be tried for 
the vomiting. 

Fluid should be given in sips as large drinks are apt to excite 
emesis. Stimulants may be necessary. Camphor is useful. 
Hot red wine, hot tea and black coffee have been recommended. 

A method of treatment which has come into vogue during the 
late Balkan war and which is said to have had a great 
measure of success is the administration of the so-called " bolus 
alba," which has also been used in bacillary dysentery. The 
bolus consists of kaolin, native aluminium silicate powdered and 
freed from gritty particles. It is insoluble and is given in a 
dose of 200 grammes (7 ounces) in 400 c.c. (14 ounces) of water. 
If it is vomited a further dose is given immediately in con- 
tinual small sips. The effect is almost instantaneous, and it 
would seem that the kaolin is well-nigh a specific, but further 
information is required. 

The standard treatment for cholera, however, is that of 
Rogers. It is based on the fact that not only is the water content 
of the blood reduced by an amount varying from one-third to two- 
thirds, but there is also a loss of saline' constituents. Hence 
the latter must be supplied, and his hypertonic solution for intra- 
venous injection consists of sodium chloride, 120 grains; potas- 
sium chloride, 6 grains; calcium chloride, 4 grains; sterilized 
water, 1 pint. This is introduced by means of a special 
apparatus at the rate of not more than 4 ounces a minute. 

As a guide to the necessity for the employment of his method 
Rogers estimates the specific gravity of the blood. As full par- 
ticulars are given in the booklet accompanying the cholera 
equipment nothing further need be said regarding the method 
here. When the equipment is not available normal saline may 
be used or the emergency transfusion fluid mentioned in the 
dysentery section. It contains sodium carbonate, and as the 
latter has a lytic effect on red cells and possibly also a dele- 
terious action on the lining epithelium of the vessel walls it is 
perhaps better to use the bicarbonate. The amount converted 
into the carbonate by the sterilization process is negligible. 

The other part of Rogers 's treatment consists in the adminis- 
tration of calcium permanganate water and 2 grain coated potas- 
sium permanganate pills given very frequently at first. Details will 
be found in the equipment booklet. Continue the pills until the 
stools become green and less copious. Along with the perman- 
ganate 10 minims of a 1/10,000 solution of adrenalin chloride 



17 

may be given every 3 hours to re-establish the urinary secre- 
tion. Keep the patient warm and apply turpentine stupes to the 
abdomen. Serum therapy in cholera is still on its trial but 
promises well. The dose is 40-100 c.c. intravenously. 

A useful mixture for the reaction stage is as follows : 

B/ Bismuth salicylat. gr. 15 

Sod. bicarb. ... gr. 5 

Liq. opii sedativ m. 5 

Mucilaginis ... ... ... ... q. s. 

Aq. chloroformi ... ... ... ... 3 i 

At this stage also if the diarrhoea is troublesome rectal injec- 
tions of tannin, 1 ounce; gum arabic, 1 ounce; and warm 
water, 1 quart, are indicated. 

Inquire as to retention of urine and treat anuria by poulticing 
or dry cupping over the kidneys. 

At a later period alkalis and digitalis will be found useful. A 
serious symptom to be promptly combated is the occurrence of 
coma. As there is marked acidosis in cholera the method of 
giving 3 per cent, sodium bicarbonate solution by subcutaneous 
injection seems reasonable. It may be given frequently, in 
quantities up to one litre. 

The diet for convalescent patients must be very bland and 
easily digested and the return to ordinary diet carefully 
regulated.

DENGUE. 



This disease, also known as Dandy fever and Break-bone fever, 
ccurs in many parts of the world, and is most common along 
littorals. It occasionally breaks out in Egypt, has been reported 
from the Gallipoli Peninsula, probably visits the Islands of the 
Aegean Sea, and is almost certainly found along the coasts of Greece, 
Bulgaria, and Turkey. 

Though there is good evidence to show that the virus is trans- 
mitted by mosquitoes, certainly by Culex fatigans, and possibly by 
one or other species of Stegomyia, the germ itself is unknown, 
being apparently an ultramicroscopic organism and a filter-passer 
which is present in the patient's blood from the 2nd to the 5th day. 

Dengue has been conveyed by mosquitoes immediately after 
their meal of infected blood, but the virus may survive in them 
for 8 to 27 days. 

Symptoms. -Incubation 2 to 5 days. Onset very sudden, with 
rapid rise of temperature, which may reach 105 F. Within an 
hour or two the so-called initial rash appears. It may be only a 
blotchy congestion of the face, or there may be a scarlatiniform 
erythema, usually confined to the face and extremities. Remember 
that this primary rash is very transient and is often overlooked. 
Itching of the palms and soles may occur at the same time. Very 
soon the patient is suffering from severe headache, chiefly supra- 
and post-orbital, and the typical joint pains, which are really 
located in the tendinous insertions about the joints. There is also 
myalgia, most severe in the back. The condition indeed closely 
resembles that met with in influenza. The ocular muscles are 
specially affected, and every movement of the eyes causes pain. 
The pulse is slightly accelerated but soon slows. Swollen glands 
may make their appearance. Insomnia is present and there is 
severe mental and physical depression, while malaise and anorexia 
are marked. Constipation is the rule at the outset. There is no 
albuminuria. The temperature remains high for 3 or 4 days, then 
drops, it may be to normal, continues low for from 12 hours to 3 
days, and then rises again sharply. During the interval the 
patient feels better, but, with the relapse, the pains and other 
general symptoms start again. This stage, however, is short, but 
is marked by the appearance of the terminal rash, which may be 
signalized by a regular crisis with sweating, diarrhoea or epistaxis. 
Sometimes a crisis of this kind accompanies the first fall of tempera- 
ture. The true dengue rash resembles that of measles, begins 
about the bases of the thumbs and the back of the wrists and soon 
appears about the big toe and ankle. Then the elbows and knees 



19 

may be involved, and sometimes the exanthern spreads all over the 
body. The palms and soles may take on a carmine flush. Desqua- 
mation follows when the rash has been pronounced. This second 
stage may be very brief, or may last for a couple of days. 

The disease is very rarely fatal, and then nearly always owing 
to complications. 

Convalescence is apt to be slow and marked by neurasthenic 
symptoms. 

Leucopenia and reduction in the polymorphs constitute the most 
marked blood changes. 

While the above symptoms are those of typical dengue, it must 
be remembered that there are so-called 6 and 7 day fevers, which, 
for all practical purposes, may be classed as dengue. In these the 
typical saddle-back temperature may be lacking, the pyrexial 
record being continuous, the spleen may be slightly enlarged, and 
one or both rashes may be absent. It seems advisable to look upon 
these fevers as cases of atypical dengue and it is well to note 
their occasional occurrence. 

Dengue is very explosive in its outbreak and runs through a 
community like wildfire, exhausting itself and dying out in a few 
weeks. It must be differentiated especially from influenza, so- 
called Mediterranean yellow fever and phlebotomus fever, and, to 
a less extent from malaria, early enteric or paratyphoid, scarlatina, 
measles, early smallpox and rheumatism. 

The almost invariable respiratory involvement in influenza is a 
distinguishing feature, while the rash and slow pulse of dengue are 
absent in influenza. 

In Mediterranean yellow fever albumin will usually be found 
in the urine at an early date, and the spleen is always enlarged. 

The presence of a rash and the absence of conjunctival symptoms 
serve to distinguish dengue from phlebotomus fever, as does the 
course of the temperature, but the differential diagnosis between 
these two diseases is not always easy as both may assume atypical 
forms. 

The onset of dengue is different from that of malaria but may 
resemble the early stage of enteric and paratyphoid (see Chart IV). 

Careful observation should, however, serve to distinguish dengue 
from these fevers and from the other diseases mentioned above. 

Prophylaxis. Destroy mosquito breeding places and protect from 
mosquito bites by repellants, such as one part of oil of bergamot 
in 16 parts of kerosene, citronella oil in vaseline, 50-per-cent. 
alcoholic solution of thymol or oil of cloves in lanolin and glycerine. 
It is said that one ounce of Epsom salts dissolved in half-a-pint of 
water, dabbed on the skin and allowed to dry, affords good pro- 
tection. Where possible nets (18 meshes to the linear inch) should 
be employed. 

Treatment. Light diet. Phenacetin and aspirin for the relief of 
pain and headache. The non-depressant antipyretic cryogenin, 
largely used in French practice, may be tried. It is meta-benza- 
mine semicarbazide and the usual dose is 10 to 15 grains.

Morphine is rarely necessary and is better avoided. Cold 
spongings are useful, especially for the insomnia. 

During convalescence, where there is much depression, a sound 
wine should be ordered. Nothing is better than a good Burgundy. 
The prolonged asthenia suggests supra-renal insufficiency, and 
hence adrenalin : 30 minims of a 1 1000 solution by the mouth is 
indicated.

DIARRHCEA. 

Although a good deal of the diarrhoea seen on the Gallipoli 
Peninsula and at Mudros was merely a prelude to attacks of true 
dysentery, there were undoubtedly many cases of acute diarrhoea 
unassociated with any form of dysentery or with flagellate 
infection. 

It seems probable that the chief causes of this acute non-specific 
diarrhoea were the iugestiou of large quantities of irritating dust, 
the partaking of a somewhat coarse and monotonous dietary, and 
exposure to chill. The neurasthenic state may also render men 
prone to looseness of the bowels. The water supply does not appear 
to have been to blame to any great extent. Flies, by fouling food 
and thereby tainting it, have doubtless played a part. 

Treatment. In any case of acute diarrhoea it is probably 
inadvisable immediately to administer astringents, and this is a 
matter of still greater importance when there is a risk of a diarrhoeic 
attack passing into dysentery or cholera. 

A diarrhoea will often cure itself in time, but it may lasb for 
days and leave a subacute irritation of the bowel behind it. The 
object of the initial treatment must therefore be to prevent 
irritation and the absorption of toxins by favouring and not by 
preventing free catharsis. 

For this purpose, unless the patient is already faint and weak, 
give one ounce of castor oil. To facilitate its administration and 
prevent its rejection the following method may be tried : Place an 
ounce of brandy in a glass or cup. Carefully pour the oil into the 
centre of the brandy and then add one ounce of water. The mass 
of oil will then resemble the yolk of a raw egg enclosed in the 
white. Lime juice may be used instead of brandy. Failing these, 
black coffee helps to cover the taste and " feel " of the oil. If oil is 
not available, 3 grains of calomel with 15 grains of sodium 
bicarbonate may be substituted, or half an ounce of magnesium 
sulphate. 

Whatever evacuant is used, starve the patient thereafter for 
from 12 to 24 hours, bub let him have plenty of hot water or hot 
tea to drink. Cool water may be given if desired. Complete rest 
is essential. Several hours after the purgative has been taken, if 
one is satisfied that the case is not going to prove one of dysentery, 
commence to give carbonate of bismuth 15 grains and salol 5 grains 
combined in one powder, this dose being repeated every two hours 
for ten doses. If desired, larger doses may be given over a shorter 
period. For distension and colic nothing is better than two 
teaspoonfuls of paregoric (Tinct. camp. co.) in hot water. Repeat 
every two hours for two or three doses. 

A small dose of morphia, say one-tenth grain of morphine 
sulphate by the mouth, repeated in three hours if needed, will 



check any tendency to excessive catharsis. For very severe griping 
a moderate dose of morphia and atropine hypodermic-ally may be 
necessary, but is better avoided. Apply heat to the abdomen and 
give hot drinks. If opium is used a laxative may be needed later, 
as irritating matter may remain in the bowels. If there is 
faintness, strychnine, brandy and sal volatile are indicated. A hot 
bath, when it can be managed, sometimes acts like a charm, and in 
cases where the diarrhoea is due to chill and exposure even the 
immersion of the feet and legs in hot water and mustard does 
good. 

After 12 or 24 hours give hot milk, Benger's food, gruel of any 
kind, and gradually work up to a normal dietary. If considered 
advisable the bismuth subcarbonate in a dose of 15 grains may be 
continued thrice daily for a few days, but it is not advisable to 
carry on this treatment too long, as bismuth tends to accumulate 
in the intestinal tract. 

An iron or other tonic is often useful after a bad attack of 
diarrhoea, and the abdomen should be well protected from chill, 
especially at night. While the above method is often very effective, 
some prefer to continue the castor oil throughout the period of 
starvation in one-dram doses made up as an emulsion and given 
four- or six-hourly. Sometimes this will of itself effectually cure 
the condition, but usually only in cases seen early and before there 
has been much pain or exhaustion. 

The bismuth treatment can, as a rule, only be effectively 
carried out when the patient can be kept under observation and 
receive proper attention. Under conditions which render this 
impossible he may often be successfully treated after the 
preliminary purgation by four-hourly doses of the following 
mixture :

Tinct. opii

There is a form of acute diarrhosa, the result of excessive 
purgation, which may be very alarming, especially in enfeebled 
subjects. When feasible a hot bath is indicated for this class of 
case, together with absolute rest, stimulants, and the administration 
of such a mixture as the following :

DYSENTERY. 



Although happily the mortality caused by it has not been great, 
dysentery has been very prevalent amongst the troops serving in 
the eastern Mediterranean area. Its occurrence has undoubtedly 
been favoured by the presence of dust storms, for the ingestion of 
irritating dust particles causes a condition in the mucous membrane 
of the bowel suitable for invasion by intestinal organisms. There 
has been considerable discussion as to which of the two chief types 
has been most in evidence, but it suffices h^re to say that both 
amoebic and bacillary dj'sentery have taken toll of the forces. ' It is 
probable that throughout the winter season bacillary dysentery 
will be the more frequent and a recrudescence of the amoebic form 
may be expected with the advent of warm weather. Mixed 
infections have undoubtedly been common. Dysentery in epidemic 
form may be due to Entamceba histolytica (amoebic dysentery), or 
possibly to other protozoal organisms such as the flagellates, 
including Tn'chomonas Jiominis, Tetramitus mesnili, Lamblia intesti- 
nalis (flagellate diarrhrea), or io Balantidium eoli (ciliate dysentery). 
Recently a coccidium has been found in the stools of men invalided 
from Gallipoli, and as this organism in its development injures and 
destroys the intestinal epithelium, it is conceivable that it may 
occasionally produce dysenteric symptoms. Epidemic bacillary 
dysentery is caused by one or more of the bacilli constituting the 
dysentery group, but for all practical purposes the bacillus of 
Shiga and those of the Flexner type are all that need betaken into 
account. 

AMGEBIC DYSENTERY. 

The cause is Entamceba histolytica. E. coliso frequently found in 
the stools is non-pathogenic. The differences existing between both 
the vegetative and cystic forms of these two organisms are shown in 
the accompanying illustration (fig. 3). The important point for 
the clinician and sanitarian to remember is that the vegetative 
forms of the dysentery amoeba, i.e., those which throw out pseudo- 
podia, absorb nourishment and manufacture toxins, are not resistant 
outside the body. They easily perish, but this is not true of the 
cysts, which, so long as they are in contact with a little moisture, 
remain alive, and if swallowed are capable of causing infection. 
These cysts are chiefly found in the solid or semi-solid fteces of the 
convalescent, and hence the post-dysenteric is the cyst carrier and 
the principal danger in camp life. Apart from the carrier, infection 
may take place through the medium of water, flies, wind, soiled toilet 
paper blown from open latrines and possibly also from dust, provided 



28 

the cysts have not had time to dry and perish. When the cysts 
are swallowed their envelopes are dissolved by the digestive juices 
and their contents divide to produce small amoebae which, like their 
ancestor, are pathogenic. 

Symptoms. 

Two chief types of amoebic dysentery may be distinguished, one 
with an insidious onset commencing with diarrhoea and without 
much general disturbance, the other more acute with severe griping. 
In the former three or four pultaceous stools may at first be passed 
in the day, and there is often tenderness over the caecum and along 
the line of the large intestine. 

Fever is absent and the patient presents little signs of illness 
beyond vague intestinal discomfort, a progressive weakness, the 
passage of frequent stools and a steady loss of weight. The skin 
gets dry and sallow and neurasthenic symptoms appear. The stools 
vary. They may remain merely pultaceous or become gradually 
mucoid and show streaks of blood. Mucus alone may be present. 
Very often this chronic course is punctuated by exacerbations, when 
there is abdominal pain and some tenesmus. Gangrene may 
supervene and sloughs be passed. 

This chronic type has not been so common at Mudros and the 
Dardanelles as the acute form, which, after premonitory diarrhoea, 
starts with griping pain, often severe, and the frequent passage of 
motions containing blood and mucus, such passage being associated 
with much straining and tenesmus. As a rule there is no fever 
but nausea and vomiting often occur, the tongue is moist and 
coated and there is anorexia. The disease tends to recovery, save 
in the somewhat rare forms with fever and toxaemia, but may pass 
into a chronic type while haemorrhage or gangrenous complications 
may supervene. 

A latent form of amoebic dysentery requires special mention for 
it is apt to escape notice and is probably a fruitful source of 
" carriers. " Further, this class of case when untreated may develop 
acute attacks or liver abscess. Sometimes a history of occasional 
diarrhoea, sometimes symptoms suggesting appendicitis, sometimes 
complaints of indigestion arouse suspicion. Then, where possible, 
a saline should be given and the stools examined for amoebae. 

Morbid Anatomy. 

The ulcerative process, brought about chiefly by the amoebae 
burrowing down to the submucosa and elaborating their toxins, is 
confined to the large intestine ; the caecum, hepatic flexure and 
sigmoid being most frequently affected. The appendix may be 
involved. The condition found postmortem varies from nodules 
of infiltration surrounded by a red ring of dilated vessels to large 
circular or oval ulcers with undermined edges, the latter having the 
longer diameter lying as a rule transversely to the long diameter of 
the bowel. Stretches of healthy mucous membrane intervene 



etween the affected areas. In advanced cases thrombosis of 
vessels occurs, the ulcers may be covered with necrotic sloughs and 

he bowel wall at these points considerably thinned. These few 
notes will serve to illustrate points in the pathogenicity and 
treatment of the disease. 

Differential Diagnosis. 

From bacillary dysentery by microscopic examination of the stools 
and bacteriological tests. Clinically the diseases can rarely be 
differentiated, though a severe onset and rise of temperature suggest 
the bacillary form. The idea that a diagnosis can easily be made 
from the mere appearance of the stools is entirely fallacious, but it 
is true that the large number of pus cells in the inucoid stool of 
bacillary dysentery tends to give it a whitish appearance while in 
amoebic cases the colour is brown or greyish green It must be 
remembered that the excretion of E. histolytica is frequently inter- 
mittent, hence several examinations of the faeces at appropriate 
intervals are often necessary. 

It is also worth remembering that there is a bilharzial dysentery, 
a dysentery due to bacteria other than those of the dysentery 
group, i.e., B. pyocyaneus, etc., and that dysenteric symptoms may 
be caused by mechanical irritants. 

Complications . 

Hepatitis, liver abscess, intestinal gangrene, and peritonitis 
may be mentioned. The attack may be followed by chronic 
constipation accompanying a condition known as " dry recto-colitis," 
in which emetine has been found beneficial. 

Prognosis. 

Thanks to emetine this is now excellent. Untreated or wrongly 
treated cases may go from bad to worse, become chronic or lead to 
liver abscess. The importance of early, correct and efficient treat- 
ment cannot be overrated. Carefully wash the stools and examine 
for sloughs from time to time, as their presence or absence shows 
how the case is progressing. 

Treatment. 

This is fully detailed in the special memorandum circulated 
to Medical Officers with the M.E.F., but a short resume is given 
here. 

Dietetic. 

No milk at first. Give albumin water, rice-water, chicken broth, 
etc., for the first 24 hours. Thereafter milk diluted with barley 
water or with citrate of soda added (3 grains to the pint) to prevent 
curd formation. Soups are often useful. Later custard, arrowroot, 
jellies, etc. 

Give food in small quantities frequently and see that it is neither 
too hot nor too cold. Alcohol is deleterious. 



30 

Medicinal. 

Begin with an ounce of castor oil. If colic is present add 10 drops 
of Tinct. opii to the dose. This with rest, warmth and proper diet 
will often check a diarrhoea which, if not thus treated, might pass 
on into a true dysentery. 

Emetine is a specific. Administer it from the mere diarrhceic 
stage in doses of |rd of a grain once or twice a day, given by the needle 
intramuscularly or intracellularly. Continue it in doses of one 
grain daily until blood disappears and yellow bile-stained material 
reappears' in the stools. At the same time, save in mild and trivial 
cases give a saline mixture once a day, for example, 

Sod. (or magnes.) sulphat. ... gr. 60 

Acid snlph. dil. ... ... m. 15 

Tinct. zingiber ... ... m. 5 

Aq. menth. pip. ... ... ^ oz. 

This prevents constipation, washes away cysts, diminishes the 
risk from toxins and of septic absorption, and possibly aids 
the emetine to get at certain of the entamoebse lying at the base of 
or amongst necrosed tissue. It also benefits the colitis, and the same 
end may be served by the administration of enemata of warm water 
or saline. A hot hip bath affords relief while a soothing injection is 
made by soaking an ounce of linseed for several hours in 2 pints of 
warm water. Later on, when the stool is free from blood but still 
contains mucus, astringent enemata of tannin may be substituted 
or " eusol " injections may be tried. A suppository of cocaine and 
morphia aids the administration. Be careful to sterilize the nozzle 
of the injection tube after use. As soon as the blood has vanished 
from the stools and there is evidence of bile, cut down the dose of 
emetine to half a grain daily and do not continue using this very 
costly drug in a reckless and useless manner. Give it for a week 
or ten days, then wait for a week and start a second course if 
necessary, or give the daily dose for a week and throughout a 
second week inject the emetine on alternate days. Save in cases of 
persistent cyst infection it is rarely if ever necessary to embark, as 
has far too often been done, on repeated courses of emetine. 
Remember that if emetine is going to do good its beneficial action 
is speedily apparent. In any severe and gangrenous cases emetine 
may be given intravenously in a dose of 1| grains dissolved in 10 
c.c. of saline. 

During convalescence if diarrhoea persists salicylate of bismuth 
is very useful. In some cases bismuth in large doses throughout 
the attack is found to do good. 

Failing emetine, ipecacuanha must be given according to the 
usual formula (See Memorandum). 

In all cases the tendency to heart failure must be guarded against. 
Hypodermics of camphor are indicated (2 grains in 10 minims of olive 
oil or in vaporole form). 

Avoid opium unless the colic is severe or the tenesmus distress- 
ing. In the latter case employ it with bismuth and thin starch as 



31 

an enema, bismuth 2 drams, tincture of opium 30 minims and starch 
2 ounces. 

As regards complications liver abscess should not occur in properly 
treated cases, but if it shows signs of developing emetine will often 
cut it short and cause a cure. 

Turpentine stupes to the abdomen are useful in severe colic. 
Haemorrhage is to be met by morphia, adrenalin, turpentine or 
chloride of calcium. 

The tendency to collapse induced by the draining of the patient 
and the action of toxins is best met by giving intravenous saline 
infusions as in cholera (see instructions in cholera equipment), but 
these must be administered in time. It is no use waiting till the 
patient develops a Hippocratic countenance. A timely infusion 
may ward off this sign of impending death. The production of 
local anaesthesia by the previous injection of 1 or 2 minims of a 
2 per cent, cocaine solution with a fine needle alongside the vein 
facilitates transfusion. 

Chronic cases require large enemata of copper sulphate 1 in 1,000, 
or nitrate of silver or " eusol " with starch and opium. 

General and Prophylactic. 

The necessity for rest and warmth to the abdomen, as by a light 
linseed or oatmeal poultice sprinkled with laudanum, need scarcely 
be insisted upon. A tight flannel binder sometimes eases the pain 
of straining. 

Careful disinfection of the stools is essential and the danger of the 
cyst-carrying convalescent kept well in mind. It is of special 
importance to see that company cooks are notsuffering from diarrhoea 
or dysenteric symptoms. 

No post-dysenteric should return to duty until at least three 
weeks have elapsed since discharge from hospital. The sanitary 
arrangements for post-dysenteries require special care. They must 
thoroughly wash and scrub their hands after going to stool, and 
every effort must be made, as by the provision of fly-proof and 
wind-proof box latrines, etc., to prevent them infecting others (see 
section on Camp Sanitation). A French method of treating possible 
carriers which might be tried in the case of men getting ready to 
leave hospital and in convalescent and rest camps is to give 8 or 10 
drops of an emetine mixture every night in a cup of strong tea. 
The mixture is made by dissolving 4 or 5 grains of the hydrochloride 
in tincture of opium in the strength of 1 in 15. 

Water supplies must be properly chlorinated, and all the usual 
rules of camp hygiene rigidly enforced (see sections on Insect 
Pests and Camp Sanitation). 

BACILLARY DYSENTERY. 

The cause has already been mentioned Shiga infections being the 
more common. Recently B. dysenterine has been found in the 
peripheral blood. 

Like typhoid, the spread of bacillary dysentery may be said to be 



due to carriers, contact cases, drinking water, the dust of dried 
dejecta and the repulsive regurgitation, dangerous droppings and 
filthy feet of faecal-feeding flies. In this connection it may be noted 
that dysentery bacilli have been recovered from flies two or three 
days after their absorption by these insects. 

Symptoms. 

The incubation period would appear to vary from 24 hours to 7 
days. The onset, which may follow a premonitory diarrhoea or con- 
stipation, is sudden and attended by pain and an urgent call to stool. 
At first the motions are normal but as the attack advances the colic 
grows more severe, straining and tenesmus set in, there is diarrhoea 
and soon the foeculent matter is mixed with blood and mucus while 
later the blood and mucus predominate and finally constitute the 
whole motion. There is great discomfort about the anus, which 
becomes inflamed, excoriated and very painful, and the bowel may 
prolapse. Vesical tenesmus may occur and the urine is diminished 
in quantity. The tongue is moist and coated with a white fur, 
nausea is frequent, vomiting comparatively rare. The temperature 
usually rises somewhat and may be considerably elevated, a contrast 
to what occurs in the amoebic form. The number of stools is 
generally from 15 to 30 in the 24 hours but it may become excessive 
and exceedingly exhausting to the patient. The thickened bowel 
may be capable of palpation if the abdomen is not too tender. As 
already stated, the stools, being markedly muco-purulent, are often 
white like milk but they are rarely free from blood, which usually 
occurs as flecks or streaks. 

When the small intestine becomes involved, for this sometimes 
occurs and is very dangerous, the temperature remains elevated and 
general symptoms are much more severe though the tenesmus is 
}ess and the stools fewer. It is well to remember that the small 
intestine, if not involved, may be full of fseces, i.e., there may be a 
constipation accompanying the diarrhoea and causing distension. 

There is a serious type of case where the muco-purulent stool 
becomes serous and the patient rapidly wastes. It is this type 
which is specially prone to choleraic-like collapse. In any of the 
forms gangrene may ensue and offensive sloughs be passed. 
Toxaemia is then usually very marked, the tongue becoming dry 
and glazed, the pulse thready and a low muttering delirium 
supervening. Hiccough may set in and prove exhausting. 

It will be seen that bacillary dysentery tends to be more acute and 
more toxsemic than the amoebic type. 

A chronic form, however, is also known, that is to say a form 
more or less chronic from the outset, characterised by frequent 
stools containing blood and mucus, digestive troubles and progressive 
weakness, anaemia and neurasthenia. 

Morbid Anatomy. 

In the earlier stages the appearance of the mucous membrane of 
the large intestine has been aptly compared to lustreless red velvet f 



33 



This is due to the acute inflammation which frequently involves the 
lower third of the ileum, although Peyer's patches remain unaffected. 
Later there are areas of blood extravasation beneath the surface 
and irregular islands of greyish membrane surrounded by 
hypersemic and swollen gut. The condition is one of diffuse 
superficial coagulation necrosis and the small ulcers are not deep as 
in the amoebic form. 

Differential Diagnosis. 

That from amoebic dysentery has been mentioned. Bilharzial 
dysentery must be borne in mind, and in the more chronic cases the 
possibility of tubercle, cancer and syphilis must be excluded. 

C duplications . 

Intestinal gangrene, peritonitis, eye affections, rheumatic symp- 
toms and polyneuritis may be mentioned. The last named, which 
may be associated with oedema, tends to pass off as the ulcerations- 
heal up. Small, multiple and confluent liver abscesses may occur. 
An acute suprarenal syndrome has been described. 

Prognosis. 

In untreated cases it may be said that the immediate prognosis- 
is probably worse than in untreated cases of amoebic dysentery, 
and the late prognosis better as there is no risk of liver abscess. 

If promptly and properly treated bacillary dysentery quickly 
clears up. If neglected or wrongly treated there is often no more 
distressing and rapidly fatal complaint. 

Treatment. 

Diet, general measures and early medicinal treatment as for 
amoebic dysentery. The specific for bacillary dysentery is polyvalent 
anti-dysenteric serum. It should be given as early as possible, the 
usual dose being 20 c.c. subcutaneously. If necessary as much as 
60 c.c. may be injected or the above dose may be repeated. In bad 
cases of so-called entero-dysentery in which the small intestine is 
involved it may be advisable to give the serum intravenously. Its 
action is often remarkable. 

In addition, or if the serum is not available, the saline mixture 
mentioned under amoebic dysentry is to be used, given every four or 
six hours at first, or even more frequently, and then increasing the 
intervals between doses until the stools are watery and bile- 
stained. In Central Europe the bolus alba (kaolin) and animal 
charcoal treatment in daily doses of 3-4 tablespoonfuls of each 
suspended in water has come largely into use. 

Simple lavage of the lower bowel is very comforting. 

It is in bacillary dysentery, more especially in those cases where 

the stools become serous, that intravenous saline infusion as for 

cholera, and begun sufficiently early, is likely to be very efficacious. 

An emergency injection fluid consists of common salt 60 grains, 

(B 5057) c 



34 

carbonate of soda 60 grains, boiled water 1 quart. Give one to 
three quarts at a temperature of 100 F., carefully watching the 
effect. See Section on Cholera. 

In cases with persistent hiccough, where ordinary measures fail, 
blister the line of the vagus on each side of the neck. 

Adrenalin, both by the mouth and as an enema, is said to have a 
remarkable sedative effect on the abdominal pains and tenesmus. 

Treat chronic cases as in the amoebic type, or preferably where 
possible use enemata of the organic silver compounds albargin 
(silver gelatose) 1 in 500, or protargol 1 in 100, or " eusol " in half the 
strength used for septic wounds. Enemata of olive oil sometimes 
prove very useful. Sensitized vaccines are coming into use. 

Tne prophylaxis is in the main the same as that for amoebic 
dysentery. Carriers exist as in typhoid and are troublesome. 

NOTE. In cases of doubtful etiology, and there are many such 
on the Peninsula, there should be no hesitation in employing a 
combined therapy of emetine and polyvalent serum. 

FLAGELLATE DYSENTERY OR RATHER DIARRHOEA. 

The causative organisms have already been mentioned. Their 
r61e is somewhat doubtful, but there would certainly seem to be a 
form of persistent watery diarrhoea with bright yellow stools 
associated with the presence of Tric-hommias intestinalis. This 
infection may be treated by enemata of iodine 1 in 1,000, giving If 
pints (1 litre) every evening for three consecutive days and pre- 
ceding the iodine enema by one of boiled water. 

Chronic trichomoniasis may be treated by turpentine. For all 
forms of flagellate dysentery methylene blue may be tried in 2 to 3 
grain doses in cachet and for intestinal injection in a strength of 
1 in 5,000 or 1 in 3,000. The stools and urine become blue under 
this treatment. 

CILIATE DYSENTERY. 

This is so rare that it requires no further consideration here.

30. Large entamoeba with slit-like rectangular vacuoles. 

31. Encysted form as it appears in the faeces. This is the form most 

commonly observed and which is most useful for diagnostic 
purposes. 

32. Encysted form of abnormal type with large central vacuole. In other 

cases there may be several vacuoles, and the vacuolation has the effect ' 
of retarding 'nuclear division, as such forms usually have only two, or 
possibly four, nuclei. 

In E. coli infections it is generally only the completely developed cyst with 
eight nuclei which is passed in faeces. The earlier stages of development 
with one, two, and four nuclei take place in the large intestine before the 
cysts escape.

33. Large tissue-invading form (" tetragena " form) containing five red blood 

corpuscles. 

34. Encysted form with four nuclei, chromidial body, and vacuole. 

35. Encysted form with four nuclei. It is distinguished by its smaller size 

from the four-nuclear stage of E. coli, which, however, is rarely passed 
in the faeces. 

36. Encysted form with one nucleus and chromidial body* 

37. Encysted form with two nuclei and two chromidial bodies. 

38. Large tissue-invading form with ectoplasmic pseudopodium and contain- 

ing two red blood corpuscles. 

39. Small form of intermediate size with ectoplasmic pseudopodium. 

40. Small " minuta " form as seen in post-dysenteric conditions. 

The encysted forms begin to appear as the acute dysenteric symptoms 
subside, and are thus very characteristic of the infection in carrier cases. It 
is important to note that they are much smaller than the cysts of E. coli. In. 
E. histolytica infections it is usual to find passed in the faeces cysts in all 
stages of development.

HEAT-STROKE. 



Etiology. It would appear to be due to an autointoxication 
caused by the non-radiation of heat from the body owing to 
insufficient evaporation from the skin. As a result toxic sub- 
stances accumulate which have a selective action on the nerve 
cells. Some, however, believe the condition to be a tissue 
acidosis., there being a retention of carbonic and lactic acid and a 
consequent depleting of the blood of its alkali content. 

In any case there can be no doubt that high relative humidity 
of the air is a very potent factor in producing attacks of heat 
stroke and heat prostration as it notably checks cutaneous 
evaporation. Alcoholism is one of the chief predisposing causes. 

The milder forms are known as Heat-Exhaustion and Heat- 
Prostration. 

If eat- Exhaustion will often overtake heavily laden soldiers 
on the march in hot weather, and as soon as the man is 
relieved of his accoutrement and has a rest he rapidly recovers. 
The condition is really a syncope and a milder form of 

Heat-Prostration, in which there is giddiness and frequently 
nausea, the patient becoming bathed in a clammy sweat and 
exhibiting dilated pupils. The pulse is thready, the breathing 
shallow, and it may be sighing and unconsciousness may 
follow. The condition is non-febrile and indeed a subnormal 
temperature may be registered. After recovery headache maj 
be troublesome and mental confusion and other cerebral 
symptoms may be noticed. Rarely the fainting fit ends in 
death. 

Heat Stroke proper is a much more serious matter, and two 
clinical types may be differentiated: 1, Thermic Fever; 2, 
Heat-Cramp. An early warning sign in heat-stroke is a desire 
for frequent micturition and other prodromata are drowsiness, 
vertigo, headache and intolerance of light. The pulse is quick, 
rapidly becoming irregular, the skin is hot and dry and the 
temperature elevated. Delirium, coma or convulsions may 
ensue. The attack may come on very suddenly. Three main 
types have been observed amongst German troops : 

(a) Asphijxial, where the soldier, fighting against an over- 
powering feeling of prostration, continues to march with totter- 
ing gait, fixed stare, contracted pupils and cyanosed face until 
he collapses senseless and apparently dead. His breathing is 
in abeyance, his pulse imperceptible at the wrist and his face 
deeply cyanosed. 



40 

(6) Paralytic, in which there is deep coma, recurring con- 
vulsions, vomiting, diarrhoea and hyperpyrexia. The skin and 
dejecta may emit a mousy odour. 

(c) Psychopathic, which is not so deadly and in which the 
patient's mental balance is upset. His mind may be merely 
confused or he may pass into a muttering delirium or become 
violent and excited, or harbour delusions winch may drive him to 
suicide. 

Heat-Cramp is chiefly seen amongst ships' firemen in the 
tropics and need not be further considered here. 

Differential Diagnosis. True heat-stroke must not be mistaken 
for an attack of cerebral malaria, though it is often very difficult 
to distinguish them. The blood should be examined for para- 
sites, the splenic region palpated and percussed and the history, 
if possible, obtained. 

Cerebral haemorrhage in which the rise of temperature follows 
the insensibility, and cerebro-spinal fever have been mistaken 
for heat stroke. 

Prophylaxis. Under war conditions this is by no means easy, 
Alcohol must be eschewed, at least during the day, the skin 
kept clean, the clothes should be loose and easy and the head, 
especially the occiput and the nape of the neck, well protected. 
Spinal pads, are useful. Arms and accoutrements should be as 
light as possible, water and, when they can be obtained, citron 
drinks taken freely and the bowels kept open. 

Treatment. The milder degrees of sun headache are benefited 
by doses of caffeine and antipyrin or caffeine and phenacetin. 

For heat prostration get the patient into the shade, in a cool 
place if possible, lay him on his back, loosen his clothing 
especially about the neck and massage his limbs. If there is 
collapse give ammonia or camphor and restore his bodily heat by 
hot applications. 

The special treatment for the asphyxial type of heat-stroke is 
artificial respiration prolonged if necessary for a couple of hours. 
This is stated to be the only remedy for this form. 

The paralytic type also requires prompt and vigorous treat- 
ment. The indications are to reduce the temperature, to get rid 
of toxic . substances and to prevent cardiac failure. Where ice 
can be got it must be used to bring down the temperature, 
an iced bath or ice pack or massage with lumps of ice being 
employed. A handy way is to lay the patient naked on a 
slightly inclined stretcher, ice-pack him and play a stream of 
iced water on his head from a distance of from 15 to 20 inches. 
This ice-cold stream must not be continued for more than one 
or two minutes and collapse must be guarded against. Hence 
the rectal temperature must be taken and the cold applications 
stopped when the thermometer registers 103 F. Thereafter 



41 

wrap the patient in blankets and apply hot bottles to the trunk 
and limbs. If perspiration sets in the prognosis is good. 

If the temperature shoots up again the cold applications must 
be resumed. Where ice cannot be got, a sheet soaked in dilute 
alcohol over which a draught of air plays may be tried or cold 
water enemata given. There seems to be an advantage in 
making these alkaline, i.e., give If pints of a solution contain- 
ing 2 per cent, sodium chloride and 2 per cent, sodium bicar- 
bonate. 

As there may be tissue acidosis slow intravenous transfusion 
of a similar quantity of a 1 or 2 per cent, solution of sodium 
bicarbonate is indicated when the patient does not quickly 
respond to the treatment by cold. Such cases tend to develop 
oedema of the lungs and brain, hence, before the transfusion, 
venesection should be practised as this will also help to elimi- 
nate toxic products. Normal saline, may also be given intra- 
venously after the bleeding. 

Stimulants are often required, but strychnine is contra- 
indicated owing to its tendency to cause convulsions. When 
the latter occur give cautious inhalations of chloroform, watch- 
ing the heart. Calomel and salines are indicated at a later 
period. 

Treat psychopathic forms as for heat prostration and on 
general principles. 



42 

HEPATIC ABSCESS. 



Under this heading only the so-called tropical abscess due to 
Entanwcba histolytica and the result of amoebic dysentery will be here 
considered. With the addition of emetine to our therapeutic 
armature this condition, so serious if unrecognised, should rarely if 
ever occur but unfortunately cases, some of them fatal, have not 
been lacking, so a few notes on this, the most important sequela of 
amoebic infection, certainly seem advisable. 
Etiology. 

In all probability E. histolytica is conveyed to the liver from the 
bases of the dysenteric ulcers as a small embolus. Finding there a 
nidus in the capillaries it commences to reproduce and by elaboration 
of its toxins brings about a tissue destruction which, unless there is 
secondary bacterial infection, is not a true suppurative condition. 
Bear in mind that the condition may develop in cases which have 
apparently never suffered from dysentery. 
Symptoms. 

It may be said at once that in any man who has had a history of 
dysentery, especially if it has been proved to be amoebic, the 
occurrence of rigors, fever, night-sweating, pain or discomfort in 
the region of the liver, hepatic enlargement, uneasiness or pain in 
the right shoulder should suggest the possibility of hepatic abscess. 
Remember only a few of these symptoms may be present and that they 
may be very slight, or even altogether absent, but remember also 
that it is usually safe and easy to confirm a doubtful diagnosis by 
exploratory puncture with an aspirating needle. 

The premonitory symptoms which it is even more important to 
recognise are general malaise, anorexia, foul tongue, irregularity of 
the bowels, high-coloured urine, irritable temper and insomnia. A 
little later a feeling of weight and fullness in the right hypo- 
chondrium may be present and there is often a dry cough. The 
temperature is hectic in type. The haggard look and muddy 
complexion are very suggestive to the trained eye and a history of 
uneasiness when trying to lie on the left side is frequently 
forthcoming. Still later there is often pain and just as this pain 
may be referred to the right shoulder so it may be referred to the 
appendix. When the abscess is in the left lobe the symptoms 
suggest gastric trouble. Jaundice is rare. The patient may walk 
as though he were supporting his abscess with his right arm. 
Measurements will show a difference of girth on the two sides and 
enlarged superficial veins are often visible. 

Physical examination may also detect rigidity of the right rectus, 
tenderness and upward enlargement of the liver and crepitations or 
pleuritic friction at the base of the right lung. Pulmonary 
auscultation should never be neglected. Neither should a blood 
examination, the total leucocyte count and more especially the 



43 

differential count being important. There is an early pre- 
suppurative stage when hepatitis alone is present and where a 
leucocytosis exists together with only a slight increase in 
polymorphs, distinctly less than what occurs in septic bacterial 
inflammation. It is characterised by a low remittent fever. Once 
the abscess has developed the same conditions persist and though 
the mere leucocytosis does not help one much the comparatively 
slight increase in polymorphs, i.e., 70 to 80 per cent, is distinctly 
suggestive. 

In more chronic cases owing to a diminution in the red cell count 
there is a distinct relative increase in the leucocytes. 
Morbid anatomy. 

All that need here be said is that the favourite site is the superior 
and posterior part of the right lobe and near its surface and that 
though a single abscess is the rule, multiple abscesses are by no 
means uncommon. 
Diagnosis. 

When available the X-rays are useful for they enable the detection 
of diminution in movements of the right side of the diaphragm, an 
important earlv sign of acute hepatitis. They also show the upward 
enlargement of the liver when an abscess is present in the right 
lobe and may indicate a definite localised increase in the density of 
the liver shadow. Blood examination must not be neglected for, 
amongst other things, it may save one from plunging a needle into 
a leucocythsemic liver and thereby inducing a fatal haemorrhage. 
Finally there remains exploration by the aspiration needle, the 
outer extremity of which will swing up and down like a pendulum 
if the needle has entered the liver. 
Differential Diagnosis. 

It is impossible here to mention all the conditions from which 
liver abscess has to be distinguished. Remember especially malaria 
and malarial hepatitis, inflammatory and suppurative states of the 
gall-bladder, hydatid cysts, appendicitis, tuberculosis and scurvy. 
The last named is specially mentioned as it has occurred amongst 
men in the M. E.F. 

Treatment. 

In the pre-suppurative stage and even apparently when the 
"abscess has actually begun to form emetine given by the needle can 
effect a cure. A grain once, or perhaps better twice, a day should 
be given together with cautious purging by the sodium sulphate 
mixture mentioned under " Dysentery." If emetine cannot be got 
recourse must be had to ipecacuanha. 

For local pain cupping, ammonium chloride in 20 grain doses 
thrice daily and the application of leeches round the anus are 
recommended. 

The operative treatment for liver abscess is beyond the scope of 
this section, but mention may be made of the practice of 
aspiration combined with the injection of a solution of emetine, one 
grain to two ounces of water into the abscess cavity. 



44 



INSECT PESTS, 



WINGLESS PESTS. 

Under this heading the following insects are 
included: Lice, Bugs, Fleas, Ticks and Ants. 

LICE. 

Diseases transmitted by.-^ -Typhus and relapsing fever. Lice 
also cause great cutaneous irritation. 

THE CLOTHES LOUSE (PEDICULDS VESTIMENTI). 

Also called the body louse. The female lays about 60 eggs in 
a period of two weeks, the eggs hatching in from eight to eleven 
days. The young lice, though much smaller, resemble the adults 
except for minor characters, and almost immediately upon 
emerging from the egg begin to suck blood, continuing to do so 
every few hours. During the course of a fortnight they moult 
several times and increase in size, becoming sexually mature at 
about the end of that period. Lice quickly die when separated 
from their host. 

The eggs are laid among, and attached to, the fibres of the 
clothes, the female showing especial preference for seams and 
linings a point of importance in considering the destruction of 
lice. These eggs are about the size of a small pin's head and are 
yellowish-white in colour, goblet-shaped, and firmly attached at 
the lower end to the cloth fibre by a cement excreted by the 
female (Fig. 5fi). 

Examination for Lice. Persons suspected of harbouring body- 
lice should be examined first for the actual bites of the insect on 
the skin, which show as tiny punctures with small encircling 
areas of inflammation ; the clothes should then be carefully ex- 
amined, particularly the under-garments, with special attention 
to the seams and folds, where the eggs, if present, are most 
likely to be found. 

Preventive Measures. Many have been recorded, but few are 
really efficacious. Amongst the latter may be mentioned 
" .Vermijelli," Oxford powder (practically " Vermijelli " in 
powder form), naphthalene, creosote, and iodoform (" N.C.I." 
mixture), vaseline and camphorated oil 10 per cent. When 



45 

using the latter it is advisable first to sponge the body of the 
patient thoroughly with a 1 in 1,000 solution of mercury bi- 
chloride, and, after drying, to rub the camphorated oil well info 

the skin. 

. 

Destruction of Clothes Lice. Here again a great many 
different measures have been advocated, but lice in clothes are 
apparently best destroyed, together with their eggs, (1) by heat- 
ing the clothes en masse in a suitable sterilizer such as the 
Thresh machine or in the barrel disinfectors exposed to current 
steam; care should be taken that, the clothes are loosely packqd 
in the sterilizer to ensure the penetration of the steam to every 
part of the garments. Eggs, when killed, are found to have lost 
their shiny appearance. (2) By sulphur fumigation. (See 
Sanitary Notes.) (3) By spraying them with petrol, paraffin, 
benzine, or 10 per cent, formalin, or simply by subjecting them 
particularly the linings and seams in all cases to a steam jet, 
such as can be readily obtained from a kettle. A hot iron passed 
over the clothing is most effective. (4) By washing with 
41 Vermijelli," using the " Vermijelli " as soap. 

Other preparations which have been used with success 
are: Menthol powders: (i) Menthol gr., 5-10; Zrici' ox. ad., 
7, i. ; (ii) Menthol gr. 5-10; pyrethrum gr. 30-^ j; Zinci ox. 
5 ij; talci ad. 3 j; but they are somewhat expensive. Guaiacol 
and vaseline are also useful. The powders are sprinkled over 
the bodv and clothes and. the vaseline is rubbed into the skin. 



THE HEAD LOUSE (PEDICULUS CAPITIS). 

Morphologically, and in almost all points of its life history, 
this parasite resembles the clothes louse, except (1) that it is a 
trifle smaller, and (2) that it is a parasite exclusively of the hair 
of the head (Fig. 5 A). 

Examination for Head Lice. The head of the suspected 
person should be carefully examined for the actual parasites or 
their eggs. The latter popularly known as "nits" are 
minute yellowish -white, goblet-shaped bodies about the size of a 
" full stop " on this page, and are found firmly cemented to 
individual hairs. In the examination for head lice a fine tooth 
comb is of great assistance and should be used. 

Preventive Measures. The best safeguard from infestation 
is to wear the hair cropped close and to indulge when possible 
in frequent washing with carbolic soap or cresol soap solution. 
(Jeyes' fluid H z - soft soa P H Iks., water 10 gallons.) 

Destruction of Head Lice. The heads of infested persons 
should be thoroughly combed and treated with paraffin, petro.l, 
soap liniment, white precipitate ointment, -or benzine, and 



46 

then well washed with cresol soap solution, carbolic soap, 
or lysol. If the infestation is particularly heavy, and the ex- 
posure to re-infestation is constant, the hair of the head should 
be cropped short and maintained in that state. 

THE PUBIC OR CRAB LOUSE (PHTHIRIUS INGUINALIS). 
This parasite is rare and at first sight only resembles the two 
former lice in that it has the same habits of feeding, general life 
history and of clinging to the host by means of clawed legs. 
P. inguinalis infests the hairs of the pubis, and occasionally 
those of the axillae and eyebrows. It is a much flattened 
creature, and the leg claws are particularly strongly developed, 
giving it the appearance that has led to its popular name 
(Fig. 60). 

Examination for P. inguinalis. Infestation by this parasite 
causes intense irritation, and the bites being confined to a 
limited area often lead to extensive inflammation. The presence 
of the parasites can be ascertained in the same manner as that 
adopted for P. capitis. 

Destruction of P. inguinalis. Any of the above substances 
advocated in the destruction of the other lice are suitable. 
Vaseline and yellow precipitate (1 in 50) is, however, specially 
recommended in cases of infestation of the eyelashes and eye- 
brows. 

THE BED-BUG. 

Two species of bed-bug are important, Cimex lectularius and 
C. rotundatus. The former is the common bed-bug of northern 
latitudes, the latter the bed-bug of the tropics. Both have 
much the same habits and life-history. 

Diseases transmitted by. None definitely known but the 
bed-bug has been accused of carrying kala-azar, leprosy, 
tubercle, plague, anthrax, relapsing fever and typhus. 

ClMEX LECTULARIUS AND C. ROTUNDATUS. 

Both males and females suck blood, and they are nocturnal in 
their activities. During the daytime they usually hide in 
cracks in floors, walls and furniture, or in beds, among the folds 
of the sheets and blankets, in or below the mattress, or, in fact, 
anywhere where they may remain quiet and obscure until the 
night. Bed-bugs are capable of migration from house to house 
or from tent to tent and can live for long periods nine months 
or more without food, so that an infested place may remain so 
for a lengthy period. 



47 

The female lays a large number of eggs, which are deposited 
in clusters of 20 or more. A single female C. lectularius in 
captivity has been known to lay as many as 111 eggs in 81 days. 
There is no special season for egg-laying, and it continues 
throughout the year, the eggs being deposited in the hiding- 
places of the adults. 

The eggs are a dirty white colour, about 1 mm. in length and 
ovoid in shape, the upper end having a disc-shaped cap (oper- 
culum) that projects more over one side than the other. The 
female bug attaches the lower end of the eggs by a gelatinous 
substance to the side of the crack or crevice in which she hides 
them. The larvae hatch out in from four to nine days, and feed 
soon afterwards if a blood meal is available. Four or five days 
thereafter the larvae moult and attain the first nj'mphal con- 
dition, and after four subsequent moults the adult stage is 
reached in about six or seven weeks from the hatching of the 
egg. Sexual maturity is attained from ten days to a fortnight 
later. 

Examination for Bed-Dugs. The walls, floors, ceilings and 
the contained furniture particularly wooden beds and bedding 
of suspected rooms should be carefully examined, especially 
obscure corners and cracks in the walls, &c., that are likely to 
prove hiding-places for the parasites. In the case of beds and 
bedding, special attention should be devoted to folds in the 
mattress and to the crevices formed at the junction of the bed- 
stead units. 

Preventive Measures. In houses and tents that are liable 
to infestation the best safeguard is cleanliness and the removal 
of all possible hiding-places for the bugs, such as the filling up 
of cracks in the walls, &c., of houses. Bedsteads may be treated 
with paraffin, either in the form of a spray or by applying it 
with a rag. Vaseline is also excellent for the purpose. Wooden 
floors should be frequently scrubbed with hot water and soap- 
suds and powdered naphthalene may be dusted where the use of 
the water and soapsuds is inadmissible. 

Destruction of Bed Bugs. Infested rooms should, if possible, 
be subjected to fumigation by sulphur, using 2 Ibs. of sulphur to 
every 1,000 cubic feet of space. If this is impossible a paraffin 
spray should be used, working over all possible hiding-places. 
The floors should be thoroughly scrubbed with riot water and a 
solution of strong soap and, after drying, may be advantage- 
ously dusted with a small quantity of powdered naphthalene. 
If none of these measures is possible, a paraffin or benzine blow' 
lamp may be used to kill the adults and their eggs in their 
hiding-places. The lamp should be pumped up to a strong blast 
and the flame directed against and rapidly moved over all sus- 



48 

pected places. In this way a temperature lethal to the bugs and 
their eggs is created, but, with the lamp moving rapidly, suffi- 
cient heat to injure the walls or woodwork of furniture is not 
forthcoming. 

FLEAS. 

Diseases transmitted by. Plague and possibly kala-azar. 

Fleas that commonly attack Man : Pulex irritans and Xeno- 
psylla cheopis. The female lays large eggs, singly, and these are 
not attached to the residential host but, when laid, fall to the 
ground. They are found most readily -in the sleeping places of 
animals. In summer the eggs hatch in from 2 to 4 days, but in 
winter the incubation period may be extended to a fortnight. 

The eggs hatch and an active footless larva emerges, dirty 
white in colour and sparsely clothed with long, fine hairs. It 
lives among dust, on floors, &c., 'feeding on organic matter. The 
larva attains its full development in about two weeks when 
the weather is warm, then seeks a quiet place and spins a 
cocoon, in which it pupates. The pupal stage extends over a 
period of about another fortnight, and the adult flea emerges. 

Adult fleas are as a rule only too much in evidence, but in 
order to find the immature stages the dust from the floors of the 
suspected place should be brushed up and examined with a 
hand lens for the eggs, larvae and pupae described above. 

Preventive Measures. No dust or fine organic debris should 
be allowed to gather". Wherever possible all textile floor cover- 
ings should be abolished. The floor .may with advantage be 
dusted with powdered naphthalene or pyrethrum powder 
(Keating 's). Both these powders can be applied to the clothes 
to prevent attack by fleas. Pesterine and the tricresol powder 
mentioned under the section on plague are useful. 

Destruction of Fleas. Infested houses or dug-outs should be 
fumigated with sulphur, 4 Ibs. to every 1,000 cubic feet, or with 
formaldehyde vapour, produced by adding 20 c.c. (about f oz.) 
of formalin to 8 grams (about 124 grains) of powdered potas- 
sium permanganate. This will kill adults and all other stages. 
The house or tent, after thorough fumigation, should be care- 
fully swept of all collected dust. 

TICKS. 

While ticks are responsible for the transmission of one or two 
serious diseases in tropical Africa and America, so far as the 
Near East is concerned they need not be considered except in 
regard to the larval stage of one sub-family (Ixodidee), which is 
often a serious nuisance on account of its habit of burrowing int6 
the skin of persons who have come in contact with it (Fig. 6). 



49 

The female tick lays her eggs in the earth (preferably damp), 
and these hatch and emerge as tiny, six-legged larva, brown in 
colour and about the size of small pin heads. These larvae seek 
long grass and climb the stems until they come to the upper ends. 
Here they rest until an animal that may serve as a host chances 
to pass and brush against the grass, when they are often trans- 
ferred in large numbers to the prospective host. In the larval stage 
almost any animal will serve this role, man being no exception, 
the larvae apparently finding that his clothes afford an excellent 
means of transference. They immediately burrow through the 
clothing to the skin, where they attach themselves by means of 
the rostrum or proboscis that projects from the head. When 
force is used in the attempt to remove the attached tick one of 
two things happens either the surrounding skin is unneces- 
sarily torn or, as is most probable, the head of the tick is rup- 
tured, the rostrum remaining buried in the skin. This sets up 
severe irritation, and may even lead to septic infection; there- 
fore, rather than forcible removal, the following course is 
advocated where time permits. 

A small camel's hair brush should be dipped in turpentine, 
benzine, petrol or paraffin and applied between the skin and the 
under surface of the tick. After a few moments the tick will let 
go its hold, being killed by the application, and may be swept 
from the skin with the brush. Any other oil may be used for 
the same purpose and vaseline smeared over the tick and sur- 
rounding skin is equally efficacious. To remove a rostrum that 
remains in the skin after a tick has been forcibly removed, 
cocaine should be applied to the spot and the rostrum extracted 
with needle forceps, the spot afterwards being antiseptically 
treated. 



ANTS. 

As regards this group it need only be remarked that ants have 
been incriminated experimentally in the spread of typhoid and 
cholera and emphasis should be laid on the fact that food must 
be protected from their predations. Ants may travel from in- 
fective material to foodstuffs, carrying with them pathogenic 
organisms and making it essential that food be placed out of their 
reach. This is especially important when cholera is present. 

Ants may be kept from food on tables by tying paraffin-soaked 
rags round the legs of the latter. Kill the insects by the upe of 
Heating's or other insect powder, such as borax. 

To avoid the incursions of ants into tents and houses, &c., all

entry and exit should, as far as possible, be blocked up aud 
sprayed with paraffin or powdered with borax. If practical, the 
nest should be traced by the " route,'' and destroyed by digging 
up the soil over and around it for several inches, pouring in 
about a pint of petrol or paraffin and setting the latter alight. 



WINGED PESTS. 

Under this heading Mosquitoes, Sandflies, Midges, 
House-flies, Stable-flies, Carcase-flies and Hippo- 
bosca are included. 

MOSQUITOES. 

Diseases transmitted by (in the war area). Malaria, dengue 
fever, and possibly so-called Mediterranean yellow fever. The 
common European anopheline known to transmit malaria is 
A. maculipennis (Fig. 7). 

THE ANOPHELINE MOSQUITOES. 

Among mosquitoes of this sub-family are included those that 
transmit malaria. They are characterised by their spotted 
wings and by the fact that the palps of both male and 
female are long. The male may be distinguished from the 
female by its densely hairy and plume-liko antennae, 
those of the female being not nearly so thickly clothed 
with hairs (pilose). The female alone sucks blood, and after a 
meal she seeks a quiet place in which she can digest the blood 
while her eggs rapidly mature in her ovaries. In the course of 
a few days she makes for water, where she lays her eggs singly 
or in star-like clusters on its surface. The eggs are cigar-shaped, 
and each has a small swelling on either side serving as a 
float. After a few days the eggs hatch and minute, active larvae 
emerge, which, owing to their transparency and small size, are 
at first difficult to see, the so-called " wrigglers " (Fig. 9). ' 

When the larva is feeding or frightened it remains submerged 
at a depth, but when resting or taking in fresh air supplies it 
lies just below, and parallel to, the surface. This parallel posi- 
tion is another important anopheline character, distinguishing 
their larvae from nearly all others. The larvos feed and grow 
rapidly, undergoing three moults. The time spent in the larval 
condition depends partly on the temperature of the water aud 
partly on the food supply, but with both favourable this con- 



51 

dition is passed through in about a week or ten days. The 
fully grown larva then casts its skin and attains the pupal con- 
dition when in shape it appears like an overgrown comma. 
The pupa swims by active strokes of its tail and at rest lies 
just below the surface, breathing through two. small tubes or so- 
called " trumpets," that are situated at the sides of the head 
and which just break the surface film. The pupal stage lasts 
about a week, and then the pupal case splits and the perfect 
insect emerges. 



THE CULICINE MOSQUITOES. 

In this sub-family are included the mosquitoes responsible 
for the transmission of dengue fever and possibly Mediterranean 
yellow fever, such as Culex fatigans and Stegomyia fasciata 
(Aedes calopus) (Fig. 8). 

Speaking generally, culicine mosquitoes may be distinguished 
from anophelines In the adult stage : (1) by the wings not being 
markedly spotted, particularly along the front edge of the wing; 
(2) by the fact that the male only has palps as long, or nearly as 
long, as the proboscis, the palps of the female being very short 
and appearing as two small projections at the junction of the 
proboscis with the head; (8) by the resting attitude, culicines 
resting parallel to the surface while anophelines appear to 
stand on their heads. In the larval stage : (1) by the position 
the larva takes up when at rest at the water surface, the ano- 
pheline larvae lying parallel to it, while the culicine larvae hang 
head downwards; (2) by the fact that the culicine larva pos- 
sesses a breathing tube at its posterior end, this being absent in 
the case of anophelines (Fig. 9). 

The pupal differences are very slight. 

Preventive Measures. In order to prevent the breeding of 
mosquitoes care should be taken as far as possible that no waste 1 
water be allowed to collect and stand, and all small reservoirs, 
such as tanks and cisterns of fresh water, should be adequately 
protected by tight-fitting covers, and such covers kept in good 
repair. Old tubs, bottles and tin cans in the open that might 
catch rainwater should be abolished, small pools and ditcheH 
should be drained and filled up with earth. 

Pools that are too large to drain or fill up should have any 
aquatic growth destroyed and removed as much as possible and 
be treated with paraffin or with 1 pint paraffin or kersosene to 2 
of crude petroleum oil, using about % pint for every 100. square 
feet. This should be done at least once a week. 

For ditches and camp drainage gutters drip-cans may be estab- 
lished, discharging about 20 drops of the oil per minute. These 
are easily made either by puncturing a paraffin tin with a nail 

(B 5057) ^E 



52 

and inserting a wick of cloth or tow or by inverting a corked 
bottle filled with the oil and puncturing the cork. Both kinds 
of containers should be mounted on some sort of platform over 
the centre of the water-course. (See Sanitary Notes.) 

Where there is no danger of poisoning to men or animals, 
Sanitas-Okol may be employed, using 1 in 10,000, or 1 oz. of 
crude carbolic acid per 10 cubic feet of water. 

When feasible, houses should be screened and mosquito nets 
used (18 meshes to the linear inch). 

As repellants, the following are recommended : 

(1) Citronella oil in vaseline. 

(2) Oil of bergamot in kerosene (1 in 16). 

(3) 50 per cent, alcoholic solution of thymol or oil of cloves, 
in lanolin. 

(4) Cassia oil as recommended by Hewlett. 

It is said that 1 oz. of Epsom salts dissolved in -pint of 
water, dabbed on the skin and allowed to dry on it, will prevent 
mosquitoes from biting. 

Destruction of Mosquitoes. Booms, dug-outs and tents that 
are infested with these insects may be fumigated with sulphur, 
formaldehyde or cresol. The latter substance is best vapourised 
in a shallow container over a lamp or other source of heat, 
using about 4 ozs. per 1,000 cubic feet. 

SANDFLIES. 

Diseases transmitted by. None definitely known, but the 
bites of these minute bloodthirsty flies are particularly severe 
and painful when they attack in large numbers. The flies are 
likely to be met with during the spring and summer in the 
Balkans. 

The Simuliidae (sometimes popularly known as sandflies and 
also called buffalo gnats) are small dark, hump-backed flies, 
ranging in size from about a large pin's head to about one- 
eighth of an inch in length (Fig. 10). 

The female simulium, which has a short but formidable 
proboscis, lays her eggs in gelatinous masses on water weeds 
and stones in running streams; these hatch and small peculiar 
larvae emerge which have a sucker at the posterior end of the 
body by which they attach themselves to stones or weeds in 
the stream. The pupae are enclosed in a kind of cocoon. The 
cocoons and enclosed pupne are also attached to stone or sub- 
merged water weeds. 

Preventive Measures. The elimination of simulium from a 
district is too great a problem for consideration in a war area. 
To keep off the adult flies only the female of which, as a rule, 
bites some repellant may be used, such as a lotion of an essen- 



tial oil made up with quinine or an infusion of quassia. Citronella 
oil and oil of bergamot have also been recommended. For 
other insect repellants sec section dealing with mosquitoes. 



MIDGES. 

One genus only need be considered, viz., Phlebotomus, species 
of which are known in Southern Europe sometimes as " Sand 
Flies " or " Pappataci Flies." 

Disease transmitted by. " Pappataci Fever " or " Three-day 
Fever.* 1 

PHLEBOTOMUS. 

Small flics having the wings and body very thickly covered 
with hairs (see section on Phlebotomus Fever). In most species 
only the female sucks blood and though the flies are 
minute their bites cause very severe irritation. On the 
slightest disturbance the insect by short rapid flights suddenly 
moves to left or right, suggesting to some extent the move- 
ments of a flea. Its small size enables it to creep through 
the mesh of ordinary mosquito nets. 

The fly breeds in damp places where there is rotting vege- 
tation, such as dark and damp cellars, caves, cracks and fissures 
in soil, under damp stone walls, in tunnels, &c. The egg hatches 
and gives rise to a minute caterpillar-like larva, whose body is 
studded over with spines, and bears several long hairs at the 
posterior end. The larva lives on decomposing vegetable 
matter and when fully grown pupates, the perfect insect emerg- 
ing some days' later. 

Preventive Measures. Use of a fine mesh net. Employ 
repellants, such as eucalyptus oil, or camphor. Hewlett has 
recently found that cassia oil is the best application. (See 
section on Phlebotomus Fever.) 

Destruction of Phlebotomus. No satisfactory measures can 
be advocated beyond trapping the adults and the possible 
destruction of places likely to act as breeding grounds. Among 
these may perhaps be particularly mentioned old and damp 
latrines. Booms and dug-outs may be fumigated by sulphur. 



HOUSE FLIES. 

Diseases transmitted by. The common house fly (Musca 
dornestica) is definitely known to distribute certain pathogenic 
bacteria and proto/oa and to contaminate food by carrying the 



54 

organisms on its body, wings and legs, or depositing them by 
regurgitation or in its droppings. The lesser house fly (Fannia 
canicularis), so common at Mudros in the summer, has the 
same filthy and dangerous habits as Musca domestica. 



MUSCA DOMESTICA. (Fig. 11.) 

Finds a favourite breeding-place in human excrement, in 
manure, scraps of food and offal and filth generally, provided 
it is fairly moist. The female lays a large number of eggs, 
each of which is white, t sticky, shiny, cigar-shaped and can 
be seen by the unaided eye (Fig. 12). They are usually deposited 
in batches on the surface of the breeding place and hatch in from 
one to four days according to the temperature. The larva is a 
small footless maggot, cream coloured and tapering anteriorly 
to a fairly sharp point (Fig. 13). 

The larvae feed on the decomposing material in which they 
have hatched and when the weather is hot become fully grown 
in about five days. They then migrate from the food, and, if 
possible, work their way down into the subjacent and surround- 
ing earth, where the body shrinks to an elongated barrel shape. 
They may be found at a depth varying from a few inches to 
several feet, according to the nature of the soil. The outer skin 
hardens slowly and later takes on a deep brown colour forming 
the pupa case or puparium (Fig. 14). The pupal stage lasts from 
three to five days under favourable conditions and the fly then 
emerges, working its way through the soil to the surface. At 
first the wings are crumpled and folded, and until these expand 
the flies are often to be seen running over the breeding-ground, 
looking at a short distance very much like small spiders. 
About an hour after emergence the wings are fully expanded and 
a little later the fly is capable of flight. 

Preventive Measures. Abolish all possible breeding places. 
Protect all larders, food and latrines by screens, nets, &c. Food- 
stuffs in jugs and basins should be guarded by mosquito-net 
covers, such as can be readily made from mosquito-netting by 
cutting out pieces the requisite size and attaching small weights 
or beads along the edges. These can be thrown over the mouths 
of the vessels containing food. Guard against flies getting on to 
the lips and into the mouth when asleep in fly-infected places by 
the use of head nets. 

Refuse should be burnt or deeply buried and the earth 
stamped down firmly upon it. -If this is impossible it may be 
thoroughly sprayed with borax sodium arsenate solution, con- 
sisting of 18 ozs. borax, 7 ozs. sodium arsenate in 1 gall, of 



55 



water or drenched with kerosene or solar oil. (See Section on 
Camp Sanitation.) 

Destroy flies by : 

1. Traps, including " Tanglefoot " and other sticky fly-papers. 
A useful formula is 5 parts castor oil and 8 parts resin, the 
mixture being well boiled. The traps of various kinds may be 
baited with a mixture of one part milk and two parts brown 
sugar thoroughly mixed, or with food possessing an attractive 
odour meat, fish, &c. 

2. Poison-baits, such as a mixture of milk 20 per cent., 
formalin 5 per cent., water 75 per cent., with a little sugar 
added to it. 

This should be spread about on tables, shelves, &c., in the 
form of droplets. Arsenite of soda used in a solution as follows : 
1 Ib. arsenite of soda, 10 Ibs. sugar in 10 galls, of water. Strips 
of canvas, frameworks of knotted string or small branches of 
some tree or shrub whose leaves will remain on when they dry, 
should be dipped in this solution and hung up in safe and con- 
venient places. This mixture, where there is no danger of 
animals being poisoned, can be sprayed over refuse and fly- 
breeding places. It can also be placed in shallow pans in latrine 
buildings. 

3. Poisons, including Keating 's or pyrethrum powder, which 
is best placed on the sashes of windows, and blown on to 
places where flies congregate. The arsenical fly-papers, which 
only require damping and exposure on plates to be effective, 
can also be used. 

Flies on board ships can be got rid of by " Clayton " fumi- 
gation. 



THE LESSER HOUSE FLY, ALSO KNOWN AS THE LATRINE FLY 
(FANNIA CANICULAHIS). (Fig. 15.) 

This fly resembles Musca domestica except that it is some- 
what smaller, and, as its popular name signifies, specially fre- 
quents latrines. 

It usually breeds in old vegetables or vegetable refuse 
but a favourite breeding ground is human faeces. The larva is 
a peculiar dirty-white coloured creature, possessing tassel-like 
processes from each segment of the body, shown well in the 
accompanying illustration (Fig. 16). The other stages and details 
of development resemble those of Musca domestica. 

Since the larvae of this fly often live in vegetables they 



56 

sometimes find their way alive into the human intestine, thus 
causing a form of intestinal myiasis. 

Preventive and Destructive Measures. As for Musca domes- 
tica, except that the favourite breeding place of this fly must 
receive special attention. 



THE STABLE FLY (STOMOXYS CALCITEANS). (Fig. 17.) 

As will be seen this fly is rather like the house-fly but it has a 
spotted abdomen and is a blood-sucker, being furnished with 
.1 stout proboscis. 

It commonly attacks animals, biting mules and horses about 
the fetlocks and drawing scarlet beads at every thrust. It is 
said to carry the virus of poliomyelitis. 



CARCASE FLIES. 

Under this term several genera are considered, including the 
" Bluebottles " (Cynomyia, &c.), the " Greenbottles " (Lucilia, 
&c.) and Sarcophaga the hairy, grey-coloured flies found on 
decomposing material. 

Diseases transmitted by. It is more than probable that the 
" Bluebottles " and " Greenbottles " convey bacteria and pro- 
tozoa to food stuffs in the same way as does the house-fly. 
Worse still, in the war zone, these three classes of flies are re- 
sponsible for the cases of external myiasis (wound infection) 
that have been commonly met with in France and elsewhere 
during the present campaigns. 



" BLUEBOTTLES." 

This term, which includes several genera, is applied to flies 
whose bodies have a deep blue metallic lustre. They are the 
largest of the metallic lustred flies and the body and wings are 
in addition somewhat hairy. 



" GREENBOTTLES." (Fig. 18.) 

This term also includes several genera, but is applied to rather 
smaller flies, whose bodies show a very bright metallic lustre, 
ranging in shade from a vivid blue-green to a green -bronze, and 
they are not so hairy as the former flies. During the summer 
Lucilia were fairly common at Mudros and could frequently be 
seen feeding in open trench latrines. 



57 



SARCOPHAGA. (Fig. 19.) 

Theso are grey, very hairy flies with three dark longitudinal 
Hues on the thorax. The different species vary greatly in size, 
from about the size of Musca domestica to the largest of flies 
commonly encountered. 

The life-history of these insects corresponds in most details, 
except that in some species of Sarcophaga the female gives 
birth to living larvss and does not lay eggs. The larvse are 
deposited on the carcase or other food. 

Female " Bluebottles," " Greenbottles " and some Sarcophaga 
deposit numerous white, cigar-shaped eggs on decomposing 
material, which is a carcase for choice, and these hatch very 
rapidly to small active cream-coloured larvse or maggots (Fig. 20). 
The maggots feed voraciously and by means of two powerful 
claws that are situated within the mouth, and can be protruded, 
are able to tear and consume all animal tissues, including soft 
bone, at a truly remarkable rate. 

With a plentiful food supply and warm weather the larvae 
attain full growth in a few days, then migrate, if possible 
burrowing into the earth, where they pupate, emerging as flies 
some days later. 

So long as they confine their attentions merely to carcases 
and other decomposing material these insects may be con- 
sidered harmless and excellent scavengers; but in war time 
they often lay their eggs or larvae on exposed wounds. The 
larvae attack the living tissues, burrowing oftentimes deeply 
and causing great damage which sometimes leads to fatal results. 

When wounds are infested by these parasites the latter 
should be removed as speedily as possible by means of forceps, 
or, when infesting cavities, they should be syringed out with 
some disinfectant solution. If possible they should be sub- 
jected to chloroform vapour before this is done in order to 
stupefy them and enable the solution more readily to wash 
them out. Solution " C " is valuable fcr killing and repelling 
carcase flies. 



HIPPOBOSCA. 

On horses and other animals in Egypt, Lemiios, the Gallipoli 
Peninsula and elsewhere in the Mediterranean war area there 
\\-ill often bo noticed dark, flat, leathery, yellow-marked, ugly- 
looking flies, which at a distance resemble ticks. 

These are the Hippobosca, which suck the blood of cattlo 
and horses, but do not attack man. They will often be found 
clustering under a horse's tail, and cause the animal much dis- 
comfort. When disturbed they shift about on the skin in a 



58 

sidelong, crawling manner like that of a crab. Occasionally 
they will settle on a man or his clothes, where they cling 
closer than a brother and give rise to a sensation of loathing. 
They are easily caught by the hand and are best killed by 
pulling off their heads, their hard leathery bodies being very 
resistant to pressure.

JAUNDICE. 



Three chief types of jaundice are known to occur amongst the 
troops forming the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. These arc 
1. Catarrhal. 2. Catarrhal accompanying and complicating infective 
conditions. 3. Toxic or so-called Camp jaundice; also commonly 
known as Epidemic or Infectious Jaundice. In addition to these 
it is possible that sooner or later the so-called Mediterranean yellow 
fever or Weil's disease may be encountered. This may either bo 
regarded as a form, and sometimes a malignant form, of toxic 
jaundice or better perhaps is to be considered as a disease sui </<'/'<//< 
the etiology of which is obscure. 

1 . Catarrhal Jaundice. 

This is probably always due to an extension of a gastro-cluodenal. 
catarrh induced by chill, exposure, dietetic disturbance, &c. It 
may be accompanied by slight fever. 

Treat by calomel and salines. Avoid violent purges. Bismuth 
and bicarbonate of soda are indicated together with a simple and 
bland diet largely free from fats. In hospital practice irrigation of 
the large bowel with cold water may be tried in obstinate cases. 
This is said to induce peristalsis of the gall-bladder and duct and aid 
in the expulsion of mucus. 

2. Catarrhal Jaundice associated with infective conditions. 

Of the latter the most common in the Near East are paratyphoid 
dysentry, enteric fever, malaria and relapsing fever. Remember 
that the jaundice may mask a mild paratyphoid infection. Treat 
the accompanying condition and deal with the jaundice as in the 
simple catarrhal form. 

3. Toxic Jaundice. 

There seems little doubt but that this is due to a definite bacterial 
infection. The exact causal organism is unknown but some have 
described one of the coli group as being concerned in its etiology 
and others think that a .Bacillus proteus is concerned. An icter- 
ogenic form of the paratyphoid bacillus has also been described. 
Two French observers have recently isolated an anaerobic, icter- 
ogenic bacillus from the liver which, when inoculated into animals, 
has yielded suggestive results. Where facilities exist hsemoculture 
should be carried out in cases of this disease as it is important to 
investigate it thoroughly. The stools and urine might also be 
examined bacteriologically with advantage. 

In war time this is a disease undoubtedly associated with 

insanitary camp conditions. It was much in evidence during the 

Civil War in America and no less than 5,648 cases of jaundice 

occurred during the South African campaign, a considerable propor- 

(B 5057) F 



60 

tion of which answered to the so-called " epidemic or " infectious " 
type. The method of infection is unknown but whatever may be 
the case in Weil's disease it is very doubtful if biting insects, such 
as mosquitoes, play any part in the etiology of ordinary infectious 
jaundice. It would seem much more probable that infection takes 
place through the respiratory or alimentary tract. In this connec- 
tion flies, such as the Muscidae, may play a part by infecting food. 
The disease is nearly always benign but it often proves very 
debilitating and frequently necessitates convalescents being sent to 
England to recuperate. 

The attack may be preceded by either diarrhoea or constipation 
and the illness usually commences suddenly with rigor, abrupt rise 
of temperature, vertigo, headache, lassitude, insomnia, loss of 
appetite, nausea, it may be vomiting, pains in the back and legs 
and a coated tongue. Occasionally delirium is present. These 
symptoms issue in the stage of primary fever. Two other stages 
are generally described, those of jaundice and of secondary fever 
but the latter may be altogether absent. At first the temperature, 
the general and varying course of which is shown in the accompany- 
ing charts, is high about 103 to 104 F. It remains so for 
several days and the patient may suffer from considerable pain in the 
epigastrium and right hypochondrium while the liver and spleen are 
found enlarged, the urine often albuminous and sometimes contain- 
ing hyaline and epithelial casts and even red blood corpuscles; 
The jaundice stage begins from the third to the sixth day of 
the illness, the first tinge appearing on the conjunctivse. It sooiu 
becomes general and may be so intense that the patient assumes a 
bronzed appearance. This may persist for a month or more.. 
Usually, however, the jaundice lasts from 7 to 9 days. About the 
fifth day the temperature falls rather abruptly and attains the 
normal in from 4 to 6 days when the hepatic and splenic enlarge- 
ments and the albuminuria disappear. The pulse is rapid in the 
primary stage but becomes slow when the jaundice is established. 
The stools vary in consistence, a little diarrhoea being not infrequent. 
Later they are clay coloured or white and constipation is the rule. 

The secondary fever when it occurs lasts from 7 to 9 days but 
sometimes an elevated and irregular temperature runs a course for 
three weeks or more. In such cases it is probable that a paratyphoid 
infection is also present. The relapse generally sets in 3 to 8 days, 
after the temperature has fallen to normal and it is as a rule milder 
than the initial attack. 

The complications which have been noted are coryza, erythematous 
and urticarial eruptions, herpes labialis, erythema of tonsils and 
fauces ; cutaneous, gingival, conjunctival and retinal haemorrhages ; 
epistaxis, haemoptysis, hsematuria and melsena ; parotitis, laryngeal 
paresis, neuritis and iridocyclitis. Some of these may have been due 
to associated diseases, i.e., paratyphoid. Marked cardiac enlarge- 
ment has been noted in cases recently treated at Alexandria. 

The disease causes great loss of flesh and of bodily power and oftn 
induces mental depression. The muscle pains may persist during 
convalescence, which is slow if sure. 



61 

The treatment is entirely symptomatic. There is no specific 
drug. 

If we regard Mediterranean yellow-fever, the so-called Weil's 
disease, as a specific entity we may note that there is a possibility 
of its transmission by means of such mosquitoes as Stegomyia fasciata, 
Culex fatigans, and Culex pipiens, all of which are found in the 
Gallipoli Peninsula. The symptoms closely resemble those of 
epidemic or infectious jaundice but there are severe forms wherein 
uraemia, cardiac failure, hyperpyrexia and severe haemorrhages are 
apt to occur and which in some respects resemble true yellow fever. 
The patient may at an early stage pass into a typhoid state 
and the jaundice become intense while about the 8th day there is a 
danger of the kidneys failing which must be guarded against by free 
flushing, the injection of artificial serum, and dry cupping. If 
unemia supervenes venesection may be required.

MALARIA. 



A considerable number of cases of malaria, that most protean of 
all diseases, has occurred at Cape Helles and at Suvla Bay. 
Malaria is also endemic in and about Salonica, so that it is necessary 
to say a little about it although it is quite impossible in a short 
pamphlet to deal in anything like an adequate manner with what 
is one of the most common and important of human diseases. 

Etiology. 

It is known that the anophelines Anopheles niavulipenniss, A. 
[)</t<'xti'itcnsis and Qellicr<pka,roettsiA occur on the Gallipoli peninsula 
and the first-named at least has been definitely proved to be a 
carrier of infection. in Greece .4. maculipennes, A. biftircatus, and 
/*t/r<'t<>j>//ortrx stf/><_>/'/>ictus are all responsible for spreading the disease. 
At Cape Helles anophelines were found in the pools formed by the 
drip from the cliffs. (Fig. '21.) These pools contained abundance 
of green alg;e affording food for the larvte and such pools are 
always to be looked upon with special suspicion and should be 
carefully examined. 

The three species of malaria parasite are Platmodium malarice, 
P. vinax and I\ fida'purum and they produce respectively quartan, 
benign tertian and malignant or sub-tertian fever. What these 
terms signify and their relation to the different stages of the life- 
cycle of the parasite in man is indicated in Fig. 22, which must 
take the place of any lengthy verbal description. 

It is well to remember that there occur mixed infections and 
also what are called subintrant infections where one attack comes 
on before the other has subsided. This is due to a lack of 
uniformity in the developmental periodicity of the infecting parasite 
or to double or triple infections with the same species of parasite. 
These greatly alter the characteristic temperature waves shown in 
the diagram. 

Without entering into an account of the man-mosquito cycle of 
the parasite, one may note that from the time the female mosquito 
sucks up the sexual forms from a case of malaria to the time when 
its salivary glands are charged with sporozoites ready for injection, 
say into a healthy individual, a period of 12 days usually elapses. 

Symptoms. 

It may be said at once that at the onset of many malarial attacks 
and, in the case of most sub-tertian infections, throughout the 
attack, an absolutely definite diagnosis cannot be made in the 
absence of blood examination. Malaria is so protean in its 
manifestations that it should be the invariable rule to make and 



examine both fresh and stained blood films whenever a patient 
with fever may have been exposed to malarial infection or 
conceivably be the victim of a malarial relapse. This is tantamount 
to saying that every case of fever in the M.E.F. should, whenever 
possible, have a blood examination performed by one familiar with 
the malarial parasite and able to distinguish it with certainty from 
the manifold appearances which may, both in fresh and stained 
films, mimic it in any of its stages. 

The incubation period varies but is roughly about a week or ten 
days for malignant tertian and somewhat longer in the simple 
tertian and quartan types. There may or may not be a 
premonitory stage wherein the patient feels upset, is tired, has an 
ache in his bones, perhaps a headache, loses his appetite, possibly 
vomits and suffers from chilly sensations. At this period his 
temperature may already have begun to rise, and later on the fever 
fit fastens upon him. In many cases, however, he finds himself 
suddenly in the grip of ague, suffering from a definite rigor and 
such an intense feeling of cold that his teeth chatter and he shivers 
and shakes. 

None of the diseases dealt with elsewhere in this series have such 
a severe and well-marked onset as is seen in a typical ague attack. 
Very often the patient begins to vomit violently. He piles clothes 
upon himself and yet his temperature is elevated, the sensation of 
cold being entirely subjective. Then comes the stage of heat and 
febrile distress with flushed face, rapid pulse, intense headache, 
frequent vomiting, quick breathing and dry and burning skin, 
during which the temperature often runs up to 105 F. and the 
coverings are cast impatiently aside. There may be a slight 
delirium. Anon the sweating stage supervenes, the perspiration 
pouring from the patient and soaking everything on and about him. 
The fever rapidly declines and comfort takes the place of acute 
misery. The patient, though possibly tired, is well and can resume 
his duties. Then, according to the nature of the infection, one, two 
or three days later the fever fit recurs. 

It lasts as a rule from 6 to 10 hours, say one hour for the cold 
stage, 3 or 4 for the hot period, and 2 to 4 for that of defervescence. 
The spleen enlarges during the rigor and the urine varies according 
to the stage and may contain albumin. 

The above is a classical form of intermittent malarial fever and 
it has been seen, but sometimes not recognised, at Suvla Bay. On 
the other hand all kinds of atypical attacks may occur, especially in 
relapse cases and in quotidian infections, i.e., when there is a daily 
recurrence of fever. There is no object in detailing the various 
forms which malarial fever may assume for they are legion, 
but it is well to bear in mind that P. malar ice, the parasite of 
quartan fever, has a cycle from ring form to rosette of 72 hours, 
P. vivax, the parasite of benign tertian malaria, one of 48 hours 
and P. falciparum, so-called from its crescent-like sexual forms 
(gametocytes), also one of 48 hours, except in its quotidian 
(24 hour) forms (see charts). It should also be mentioned that 



sub-tertian infections tend to be more severe than the others and 
that the fever is apt to be of a remittent type, so that the 
alternation of hot, cold and sweating stages is absent. (See chart.) 
There are, indeed, forms of malaria known as bilious and typhoid 
remittent, but these are not very likely to be seen in the 
Mediterranean war area. The former is associated with jaundice. 
The occurrence of cerebral, choleraic, dysenteric, hsemorrhagic, 
pneumonic and syncopal forms must riot be forgotten, and as these 
very fatal varieties are only too often the result of lack of prompt 
treatment or are due to faulty treatment, the importance of early 
and correct diagnosis will be manifest. Moreover, if any case of 
malaria is neglected it may drift into a state of cachexia which it 
is frequently as hard to cure as it is to endure and may lead to a 
protracted or permanent invaliding. 

Complications. 

Coma, due to blocking of brain capillaries by vast numbers of 
parasite-laden red cells is the most important. The possibility of 
the occurrence of blackwater fever, known in Syria and Greece, 
must not be forgotten. Dysentery, if actually caused by the 
malarial plasmodium, is scarcely a complication, but pneumonia 
and nephritis merit mention. 

Diagnosis. 

If a typical case be seen at the onset of the cold stage, a history 
of possible exposure to malarial infection obtained, or indications 
that the patient may be suffering from a relapse forthcoming, then 
the pinched appearance, the teeth chattering like castanets, the 
successive shivers, the enlarging spleen and the elevation of 
temperature will, even without blood examination, make a 
diagnosis of malaria well-nigh certain. At any rate, if no facilities 
for blood examination exist, it is better to give such a case quinine 
than to subject the patient to the discomfort, and it may be danger, 
of passing through one fever fit and commencing another before 
coming to a definite conclusion regarding him and exhibiting the 
specific. Moreover, under these conditions quinine acts as a 
therapeutic test and by preventing any second attack may establish 
the diagnosis. It would, however, be well, if it were only feasible, 
in every case of possible malaria infection to have a blood film 
made and sent along with the patient to a hospital where facilities 
for laboratory work are provided. In many cases, even when the 
history suggests malaria, it is impossible to be sure without a blood 
examination, and, as regards the use of quinine as a therapeutic test, 
each case must be judged on its merits and especially has one to 
consider the probable nature of the infection (whether benign or 
malignant) and how long it will take before the patient reaches a 
place where the diagnosis can be clinched. In the malignant 
infection a marked chill is rare but the hot stage is long and severe 
and the tendency to delirium often apparent. When parasites 
cannot be found in the peripheral blood, as for example so 



70 

frequently happens after quinine has been given, a tentative 
diagnosis of malaria can be made if there is 

1. A clinical history of malaria. 

2. An enlarged spleen. 

3. A leucopenia. 

4. A diminished red cell count. 

5. A reduction in the haemoglobin content. 

6. An increase of large mononuclears. 

Differential Diagnosis. 

In this connection it is instructive to note that cases sent from 
the Gallipoli Peninsula and definitely diagnosed as malaria by 
blood examination in Alexandria were usually labelled typhoid or 
paratyphoid. Influenza, and rheumatism were other guesses, and 
there figured also that refuge for the destitute simple continued 
fever. All manner of diseases have been and may be mistaken 
for malaria, but, so far as the M.E.F. goes, the most important 
distinction is that between it and typhoid and paratyphoid. 

How closely typhoid may resemble malaria and malaria simulate 
typhoid is shown in a couple of charts which explain themselves, 
and the milder forms may at the beginning be very like para- 
typhoid. Further, malaria may run concurrently with either of 
these infections. 

Other diseases which must be borne in mind are septic 
conditions, and remember that malarial infection may be super- 
imposed upon such ; influenza, dengue, pneumonia, tuberculosis, 
hepatitis, liver abscess, relapsing fever, cerebro-spinal fever, 
undulant fever and so-called Mediterranean yellow fever. 

Prophylaxis Personal. 

The use of a mosquito net (18 meshes to the linear inch) where 
feasible. The use of mosquito repellants such as oil of cassia, oil of 
bergamot, etc. (see section on Insect Pests). The administration of 
quinine, say 6-graiii doses of the sulphate, bisulphate or bihydro- 
chloride daily with a double dose once a week. If tablets or tabloids 
are employed they should be cracked before being swallowed. It 
would seem that doses under 6 grains are not always efficient. The 
6 grain dose may be taken in an equal morning and evening dose 
or in a single evening dose. 

In dealing out prophylactic quinine to soldiers it is highly 
important to see that it is duly swallowed. If quinine prophylaxis 
is adopted it must be carried out thoroughly and carefully, other- 
wise it is a mere waste of money, engenders a false security and 
leads to erroneous conclusions. 

Prophylaxis General. 

For anti-mosquito measures see section on Insect Pests. Camps 
often' abound in drainage channels and ditches, while military 
positions are not uncommonly traversed by small streams. For 
such the use of an oil drip as shown in Fig. 23 is recommended. 
All grass and other vegetable growth must first of all be cleared 
away. 



7t 

Treatment. 

This spells quinine, but the latter will often fail unless the liver 
is first of all put in good working order. Hence a preliminary 
dose of calomel followed by a saline is advisable. In benign 
infections and when the patient has not to be hurried off it is better 
to wait till the sweating stage begins before giving the drug. 
Then administer 10 grains by the mouth and thereafter 5 grains 
three or four times daily for a week. The later doses may with 
advantage be given in effervescing form, the following formula 
being excellent : 

I. B,/ Quinin. sulphat. .. grs. 5 

Acid, citric. ... ... grs. 10 

Sacchar. lact. ... ... q. s. 

Ft. pulv. 

II. R/ Am nion. carb. ... grs. 3 

Potas. bicarb. ... grs. 10 

Syrupi simpliis "j 

or \ ... 3f 

Syrupi aurantii J 
Aq, aurantii ad 

Aq. ad 

Dissolve I in II and drink during effervescence. This mixture 
is also valuable during convalescence for, after an attack of malaria, 
quinine should be taken in gradually lessening doses for a period 
of three months. Otherwise in many cases the infection will 
persist even although the peripheral blood shows no sign of 
parasites. 

A simpler but less efficient formula is Quinin. sulph. 5 grains, 
dilute sulphuric acid 5 minims, syrup of oranges 1 drachm, distilled 
water 1 ounce. 

In ordinary cases, where there is much gastric disturbance or 
where the drug appears to be failing to act when given by the 
mouth, recourse should be had to intramuscular injections. The 
syringe and needle must be most carefully sterilized by boiling and 
by rinsing thereafter with 1 in 20 carbolic acid, care being taken 
that not overmuch of the lotion is left behind. Paint a patch of 
skin in the gluteal region an inch or two below the middle of the 
iliac crest with tincture of iodine and inject the contents of one of 
the ampoules, vials or sterilettes in which sterilized quinine 
solutions suitable for injection are now issued, after wiping off 
quinine solution on the needle with a pledget of wool soaked in 1 
in 20 carbolic. The full dose is 15 grains but it is perhaps better 
to inject half in one spot and half in the other. Be careful to 
avoid the line of the sciatic nerve. The deltoid is an alternative 
site. The application of a pad of wool soaked in 1 in 40 carbolic 
or a dab of collodion completes the little operation. If the 
solution has to be made on the spot use filtered water. Dissolve 
15 grains of the bi-hydrochloride or other soluble salt in 10 c.c. of 



72 

this filtered water and bring the solution thrice to the boiling 
point to ensure sterility. If the solution is already made up in a 
bottle it can be poured into a spoon which has been lying in 1 in 
20 carbolic, but before this is done the neck and mouth of the 
bottle should be swabbed with the carbolic solution. Then the 
quinine is drawn into the syringe from the spoon. With due 
precautions there is no danger of tetanus or septicity. The local 
discomfort is trifling and soon subsides and the effect is usually 
rapid and satisfactory. 

In pernicious infections and comatose cases the intravenous route 
is undoubtedly that to be preferred. The dose should never exceed 
10 grains of the hydrochloride or bi-hydrochloride, and the total 
quantity given in 24 hours should not exceed 30 grains. Five 
grains every four hours or 10 grains every eight hours may be 
injected. The strength of the solution should not be less than 1 in 
300 and normal saline (0'75 per cent.) must be employed. A 
quantity of sodium bromide equal to that of the sodium chloride 
used may be added for treatment of cerebral cases. 

The symptomatic treatment calls for no special notice here. 

Surgeons should note that before carrying out any serious 
operation on a man who has or may have suffered from malaria his 
blood should, where possible, be examined for signs of infection, and 
if there is evidence of it and time admits a course of quinine given. 
Even when a blood examination cannot be made consider the 
advisability of administering quinine, for an operation often lights 
up a latent malaria and the disease may very seriously, and 
sometimes with fatal result, appear in a patient after operation. 

In chronic cases exhibit iron and arsenic. A useful prescription 
for such cases showing splenomegaly is

Oriental Sore. 



This condition, better known as Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, for 
the lesion is not confined to oriental regions nor is it always an 
open sore, has occurred amongst the troops operating in Mesopo- 
tamia, and it is quite possible that cases may occur in the M.E.F., 
for the disease has been reported from Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Asia 
Minor, Turkey in Europe, and Greece. It is commonly known as 
Bagdad Button and Aleppo Sore. 

The cause is the protozoal organism known as Leishmania tropica 
{see illustration). Infection is almost certainly acquired through 
the agency of insects, but on this matter our knowledge is still 
imperfect. It is possible that the disease may be acquired by 
personal contact with an affected case, and it is worth noting that 
the condition occurs in dogs. 

Symptoms. The incubation period appears to vary from a 
fortnight to a year. The lesion may appear on any exposed part of 
the body but is most common upon the upper extremities, especially 
the forearm and hand, and on the face, especially the ear and nose. 
It is often multiple, being autoinoculable. It commences as a small 
red papule covered by a tiny reddish brown scale, and indeed 
suggests what might be called an indolent mosquito bite. It is less 
irritating than the latter and may cause no local discomfort. The 
papule, at first shotty to the feel, gradually enlarges, becoming 
purplish in colour, softer in consistence, glazed on the surface, more 
markedly scaled, and is surrounded by a narrow area of chronic 
inflammation. 

After a varying period, usually 3 or 4 months, ulceration may 
occur, frequently as a result of an injury. The ulcer is painless and 
may be an inch or more in diameter. The ulceration is superficial, 
the whole affected area being somewhat raised and surrounded by 
a hard red edge in which active multiplication of the parasites 
takes place and in which they are most readily found, especially if 
puncture by a needle or a fine glass pipette is employed. The 
ulcer exudes a yellowish secretion, is often foul smelling and 
becomes covered by a tough, adherent, dark scale. If the edges of 
this scale are forced up the yellow pus wells out. This pus forma- 
tion is probably due to secondary bacterial invasion. This may 
also lead to an enlargement of neighbouring lymphatic glands. 
Under the scab the ulceration spreads and the surrounding tissue 
may become oedematous. 

Healing sets in after 6 to 12 months, the unhealthy yellowish 
granulations being replaced under the scab by healthy pink ones 



80 

and the ulcer becoming shallower. Eventually a white or pink 
scar is left which may be very slightly depressed and is 
disfiguring. 

One attack confers immunity. There are no constitutional 
symptoms. 

There is a form in which na ulceration takes place, there being 
merely raised, shiny, softish, moveable mounds of tissue covered by 
pinkish skin. Aspiration of these reveals the parasite in large 
numbers. These forms also proceed to resolution by a gradual 
shrinkage and drying. 

Diagnosis. -This can only be made with certainty by the 
finding or cultivation of the specific parasite. The parasites may 
be found in pus from the ulcer surface but are more readily 
discovered by puncture of the unnlcerated margin. 

Differential Diagnosis. In the war area cvitaneous leishmaniasis 
must be distinguished from the so-called trench sores which, like 
the South African veldt sore, are due to staphylococcic infection. 
This can only be done with certainty by microscopic or cultural 
examination, but in trench sores the condition is more acute and 
less lasting than in the specific infection. 

Treatment. The best treatment, when feasible, is intravenous 
injection of tartar emetic, one per cent, solution of antimony 
tartrate in distilled water being used in a dose of 5 to 10 c.cs. every 
day or on alternate days, according to the progress of the case. 

Intravenous injections of salvarsan (kharsivan) and neo- 
salvarsan in the usual doses have been recommended and a French 
method is to inject hectine (an organic arsenical preparation) in a 
dose of 1 eg. for each 4 kilos of body weight into the indurated 
periphery and base of the sore twice or thrice weekly, a fine needle 
being used. This is said to induce rapid healing and to lessen 
scarring. 

Local application of tartarated antimony as an ointment in a 
strength of 2 per cent, has been recently used with success. Apply 
once or twice a day. 

Another local application consists of a methylene blue ointment 
made up of equal parts of medicinal methylene blue, vaseline and 
lanoline. Apply a thick layer of the ointment night and morning 
for 15 days. Then wash the sore and reapply the unguent as before 
until healing is complete. Permanganate of potash may be 
employed as a 1 in 20 ointment, or better in the form of a fine 
powder, when it acts much more rapidly, but in this case the 
patient must be kept under observation. The surrounding skin is 
protected by a thick layer of vaseline, and the surface of the ulcer 
is powdered. It is then covered with a pad of gauze kept in place 
by a bandage. The permanganate produces sharp pain, almost 
intolerable, which persists for 6 to 8 hours. The slough separates 
in 5 to 10 days according as the sore was exuding or dry. The 
largest sores do not resist this treatment. At most three 
applications are necessary before the sore is transformed into a 
simple ulcer on its way to cicatrisation. 



81 

A combined therapy of methylene blue and permanganate may 
be tried. Cleanse the surface thoroughly and then dust it with 
powdered permanganate. At the end of 8 or 10 days remove the 
crust and paint the brawny elevation with 1 in 10 solution of 
methylene blue. 

In well-equipped hospitals carbon dioxide snow may be used. 
It often acts admirably. Eadium exposures have also been found 
efficacious. 

Prophylaxis. Paint the site of all fly and other .insect bites 
with iodine as soon as possible. "Warn against the danger of 
infection by personal contact and that of auto-infection by 
scratching. 



PARATYPHOID FEVER. 



Apart from dysentery and diarrhoea paratyphoid infections have 
undoubtedly-accounted for most of the invaliding amongst men in 
the M.E.F. With the exception of troops which have served in 
India, B. infections have been the more common but there is no 
doubt that A. infections have occurred in men who had been in 
contact with units from India. This is in keeping with what has 
been observed in France. It is only comparatively recently that 
paratyphoid fever has been recognised as a distinct clinical 
entity and the following information is in the main derived from 
papers written as an outcome of experience in the present war. 

Etiology. 

Two separate and distinct bacilli are to blame, i.e., B. para- 
typhosus A and B. paratyphosus B. They closely resemble B. 
typhosus in their morphology and general cultural characteristics 
but differ from it in the way they behave with specific immune sera 
and in certain of their cultural reactions. As in typhoid and 
bacillary dysentery, so in paratyphoid, the methods of infection, so 
far as the Mediterranean war area is concerned, may briefly and 
alliteratively be described as contact, carrier cases, drinking water 
the dust of dried dejecta and the repulsive regurgitation, 
dangerous droppings and filthy feet of faecal- feeding flies. 

Thanks to the universal practice of chlorination water infection 
does not seem to have bulked largely. 
Symptoms. 

The average incubation period is probably about 10 days. It is 
not possible to discriminate clinically between paratyphoid A and 
paratyphoid B. The former runs a slightly longer course and 
seems to be on the whole a milder disease. 

The onset may be gradual like that seen in typical typhoid, but 
in the majority of cases it is comparatively sudden and in some it 
is exceedingly sharp. Headache and abdominal pain, or rather 
uneasiness, are the first signs as a rule and in cases with slow onset 
there is general malaise, diarrhoea which may pass off, slight 
shivering fits, pain in the back and limbs and it may be epistaxis. 
The patient carries on till he is DO longer fit for his duties. The 
opposite class of case is where a patient suddenly develops abdominal 
pain which may be severe and colicky in type diarrhoea and intense 
headache, feels feverish, shivers, may retch or vomit and is speedily 
prostrated. 

The initial attack is indeed very like one of mfluenza but lacks 
the catarrhal element, though cough and sore-throat may develop 
later or may be present fiom the outlet. Vertigo and deafness 



83 

sometime occur and a certain proportion of patients are 
constipated. 

The temperature rises fairly rapidly but to no great height, 
somewhere between 100 and 101 F. 

There would seem to be very slight cases of the disease where 
the patient is only really ill for about a week, but a typical para B 
attack runs a course of anything between 10 and 18 days and a 
characteristic para A exhibits a 3 weeks' pyrexia. 

Even at the height of his illness the average paratyphoid case 
does not look seriously ill. The general temperature course is 
indicated in the accompanying charts and only a small number of 
cases exhibit anything approaching a true typhoid state. In all, 
however, especially in the early stages there is a certain lethargy 
or apathy. A flushed face is rare and the eyes are dull and often 
kept about half closed owing to the headache which is the patient's 
chief complaint. 

The spikey nature of the temperature will be apparent and is 
very characteristic. It rarely falls to 99 and as rarely rises to 103. 
Inmost cases it keeps swinging between a couple of degrees, up at 
night and down in the morning but occasionally missing the 
remission. Now and then one meets with a case showing 
intermission. Of all symptoms the pulse rate is probably the most 
important for, unless 'the patient has been smoking, it is nearly 
always slow and very often slower, as compared with the tempera- 
ture, than it would be in true typhoid. Thus a pulse rate of 60 
may coexist with a temperature if 100 or 101 F. It varies, 
however, and several have noted a low rate coinciding with a high 
temperature. Other notable features are a certain compressibility 
and dicrotism. 

The tongue is dry and as a rule rather characteristically furred, 
there being a red tip, red edges and central red channel with two 
separate patches of thick white or yellowish white fur. In bad 
cases the regular dry, brown, furred', cracked tongue of typhoid is 
in evidence. There is little in the way of abdominal symptoms 
save a certain elasticity of the abdominal wall, and the spleen is 
not often palpable. There may be tenderness in the left hypo- 
chondrium and percussion not infrequently indicates splenomegaly. 
The liver is not enlarged, nor, save in paratyphoid A infec- 
tions, is the gall bladder painful in uncomplicated cases. 

Rose spots are very commonly seen. They come out in crops at 
intervals of 3 to 7 days, probably as a rule between the seventh 
and tenth day and last for 3 or 4 days. In a good many cases they 
are only present after the temperature has fallen to normal. As 
many mild cases from Gallipoli do not reach Alexandria or Malta 
until defervescence has set in it is well in every case with a febrile 
history carefully to examine for this eruption. When fully 
developed the spots are distinctly larger, redder and more 
lenticular than those of true typhoid. Sometimes they remain of 
the typhoid type. Their favourite sites are the lower ribs in front, 
the flanks and the back of the shoulders. When profuse they are 
scattered over the abdomen and may be minutely vesicular or have 



84 

an acne-like appearance. In number they may vary from half-a- 
dozen to well over a hundred. It is said that in paratyphoid A 
infections the rash tends to be very profuse and may somewhat 
simulate that of measles. 

Some bronchial catarrh is often present but severe bronchitis is 
not common. 

It is to be noted that moderately severe cases often markedly 
improve a few days after admission to hospital and this quite apart 
from any treatment beyond dieting and nursing. The usual fall of 
the temperature by modified crisis or short lysis is shown in the 
charts. Relapses are not uncommon and this is specially true of 
paratyphoid A where they may be associated with rigors. There 
are slight and more severe forms. The latter are more or less 
recrudescences of the disease. Actual re-infections are rare. 

Prognosis. 

This is good except in cases showing meteorism, severe bronchitis, 
certain other complications or, and this is important, a persistently 
rapid pulse, i.e., above 100. At the same time it is well to 
remember that there are very severe and fatal forms of both types 
of infection. 

Complications. 

Jaundice may mask a paratyphoid infection and should always 
be regarded with suspicion. A considerable number of complica- 
tions are mentioned, the more important being haemorrhage, 
perforation and femoral thrombosis. The tendency for paratyphoid 
B infections to involve the large bowel and to be associated with 
abscess formation must not be forgotten. A case complicated by 
cerebral abscess has recently been recorded. Tachycardia may be 
troublesome during convalescence. 

Diagnosis. 

The bacteriological diagnosis is of great importance. Blood 
culture as a rule is only positive at the beginning of the disease. 
Even at this stage negative results are common. The value of the 
agglutination reaction in paratyphoid has certainly not been 
enhanced by anti-typhoid inoculation but this is a matter which 
cannot be here considered. A leucocyte count will show leucopenia. 
Half-a-dozen negative examinations of the stools must be made 
before paratyphoid infection can be excluded and even then the 
bacillus maybe missed. It is rarely found in the urine. 

Differential Diagnosis. 

In the Mediterranean war area apart from true typhoid the 
disease which seems most often to have been mistaken for para- 
typhoid is dysentery. There is not much excuse for such a mistake 
and if medical officers were more careful to view the stools of their 
cases this error would not so frequently occur. Other faulty 
diagnoses which have been noted are jaundice, influenza, especially 
gastric influenza, bronchitis, rheumatism and appendicitis. The 



85 

condition is liable at its outset to be confused with phlebotomus 
and dengue fever and with malaria by those unfamiliar with these 
diseases. B. coli septicaemia may simulate it and can only be 
diagnosed definitely after bacteriological examination while a so- 
called infective gastro-enteritis, possibly due to B. coli commum's 
and in which the whole dorsum of the tongue is furred may 
closely resemble paratyphoid. 

Prophylaxis. 

As for bacillary dysentery. (See section on Dysentery.) 
General anti-paratyphoid inoculation is now being carried out. 
Anti-typhoid vaccination affords little, if any, protection. 

Treatment. 

As for typhoid fever. Enemata are indicated in the earlier 
stages. Aspirin often relieves headache and hypnotics are some- 
times required. A liquid dietary is necessary during the fever. 
Three davs after the temperature reaches normal jelly may be 
given and thereafter custard, porridge, etc. until the stage of solid 
food is reached.

PHLEBOTOMUS FEVER. 



This specific fever of short duration has a wide geographical 
distribution and is known to occur in Egypt and on the Gallipoli 
Peninsula. It has specially affected the French troops at Cape 
Helles. The infective agent is unknown, being probably an ultra- 
microscopic organism which is introduced by the bite of a minute 
insect, hairy as Esau, and popularly, though erroneously, known as 
a sandfly ; hence the synonym Sandfly Fever. Pappataci Fever 
and Three Days' Fever are other terms for the disease. 

The Fly. 

The fly itself, of which several species are known, all probably 
capable of conveying infection, is really a midge and is exceedingly 
minute, its tiny, hairy body minus its legs and wings being about 
a quarter the size of the head of an ordinary pin. Including wings 
and legs the insect occupies an area about equal to the size of a pin's 
head. (Fig. 24.) As the fly passes the winter in its larval stage 
phlebotomus fever is a disease of the summer months. 

The breeding places of the fly are the interior of rubble and 
stone walls, crevices of caves, cracks and fissures in artificial 
embankments such as the earthen parapets of trenches, walls of 
old cellars as in the case of Sedd-el-Bahr at Cape Helles, amongst 
heaps of damp stones, bricks and tiles, and also in the surface soil. 
A certain amount of moisture is essential for the development of the 
larvae. The adult flies shelter in similar situations, in clods of earth, 
beds of streams and in holes in trees. It is worthy of note that they 
may be carried in timber and other cargo from place to place by 
sea-going vessels, a matter of some importance in districts where 
hospital huts, cooking sheds, wooden latrines, etc., are being 
erected. 

Towards evening the flies sally forth upon the blood quest, the 
females alone being bloodsuckers. They chiefly attack the wrists 
and ankles and can easily bite through thin socks or light cotton 
clothing. A single fly can infect. 

At sunrise they vanish, either retiring to their breeding haunts or 
seeking dark corners in rooms or dug-outs. They dislike sunlight 
but are attracted by lamps and candles. It is probable that they 
rarely traverse more than 50 yards or so and they do not fly high. 

The Fever. 

It is short and sharp. Incubation period 4 to 7 days. Attack 
usually sudden, commencing with a feeling of chilliness and malaise. 
There may be rigors but these are never so severe as those of 
malaria. Vertigo, very severe frontal headache, pain at the back of 
the eyes, accentuated by pressure on the globes and the least 



91 

movement of tbe head, pains in the Lack and legs like those of 
influenza and general stiffness of the muscles soon prostrate the 
patient who becomes drowsy, irritable if roused but suffers from 
insomnia. The face is very flushed and may look swollen. The 
conjunctive are injected so that the appearance resembles that 
sometimes seen in mastiffs or bloodhounds, hence the original name 
of " dog disease." There is no lachrymation or catarrh as are 
commonly present in influenza. Anorexia with pain or discomfort 
in the pit of the stomach is a feature and constipation is the 
rule though diarrhoea sometimes occurs, as does vomiting. The 
tongue, clean at the tip and edges, is coated elsewhere by a thin, 
white fur. The fauces and palate are often congested and may 
exhibit small vescicles for which it is always well to look. Epistaxis 
is not infrequent at a late stage of the illness. The skin is generally 
dry and even harsh but may be moist. Apart from the face flush 
which may involve the neck and upper part of the chest there are 
no rashes but these may be simulated by the numerous bites of the 
sandflies which, possibly as the result of scratching and irritation,, 
may assume the appearance of a severe lesion, even simulating the 
exanthem of chicken pox. Typical temperature records are shown. 
The rise is rapid. By the evening of the first day's fever a 
temperature of 101 to 103 is reached. It remains elevated for about 
24 hours and then begins to fall, descending gradually on the third 
and fourth days and thus terminating very differently from the 
crisis of an ague fit. It is very rare to find an after rise of 
temperature. The pulse rate throughout is comparatively slow and 
the blood picture is rather typical, i.e.. a leucopenia with a relative 
decrease in the polymorphs. The eosinophiles diminish during the 
fever but increase after it. 

The patient may get better rapidly or convalescence may be 
protracted and characterised by mental depression, lethargy, 
dyspepsia and insomnia. Recovery appears to be the invariable rule. 
The blood is only infectious during the first 24 hours of the illness 
and the infected sandfly only becomes capable of transmitting 
infection after the lapse of six days. 

At the present time the. disease which most closely simulates this 
fever is paratyphoid, especially in its early stages and milder forms, 
but abortive enteric, dengue, malaria, undulant fever and influenza 
may be mistaken for it. In dengue rashes are present in 70 per 
cent, of the patients ; in influenza respiratory catarrh is a marked 
feature. 

Prevention and Treatment. 

Under war conditions it is rarely if ever feasible to make use of 
fine mesh muslin as a measure of protection, to trap the adult flies 
or to deal with breeding places. Fumigation with sulphur might, 
however, be tried in the case of rooms and dug-outs. All thatcan 
usually be done is to employ repellaiits. Of these the most useful 
is probably oil of eucalyptus which should be rubbed over the parts 
apt to be bitten, more especially the wrists and ankles, and 
(B 5057) H 



92 

sprinkled on the bedding. Hewlett strongly recommends oil of 
cassia. A lump of camphor may also be taken to bed as the flies 
dislike its odour. 

The following prescription is useful :- 
E/ Ol. anisi 

Ol. eucalypti 
Ol. terebinth. 
Lanolini i 

M. ft. ung. 

The most valuable drug in the treatment of sandfly fever is 
opium, especially if given early. A full dose (30 drops) of Extractum 
opii liquidum (Liquor opii sedativus) administered at the outset 
will be found to give great relief. Failing this Tinct. opii may bo 
given, also in a full dose. 

Quinine is useless and may aggravate the symptoms. Aspirin 
and the salicylates in fairly large doses often afford comfort and 
pyramidon has also been found to assuage pain. 

Cases treated in endemic areas in hospital should be surrounded 
by fine mesh nets to prevent the risk of others becoming infected.

PLAGUE. 



With the aggregation of ships iu Eastern Mediterranean ports, 
the movement of Turkish and Kussian troops from East to West, 
and the proximity of Egypt, plague may yet make its appearance 
in the war area, and hence a few notes regarding it do not seem 
out of place. 

Etiology. The disease is primarily an epizootic in rats and 
other rodents, is due to the coccal-like, bipolar staining, Gram- 
negative Bacillus pestis, and in its bubonic form is conveyed 
from rat to man by the rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopia 
(Fig. 25). Both the grey rat, Mus norvegicus, and the black rat, 
Mus rattus, fall victims. The former is the usual ship rat, and 
in both species plague occurs as an acute and chronic infection. 
The black rat is the more dangerous, as it lives in closer associa- 
tion with man. 

There is some evidence to show that bed bugs may be opera- 
tive in spreading bubonic plague, but their role is certainly a 
minor one. 

Pneumonic plague is transmitted from the sick to the healthy 
by droplets of sputum expelled in coughing, and also apparently 
by the invisible spray which pneumonia patients discharge from 
the mouth. It is worth noting that the domestic animals, in 
times of epidemic, may suffer from pneumonic plague and 
become sources of infection. 

Virulent plague bacilli were isolated from the lungs of donkeyb 
in North Manchuria. 

Both bubonic and pneumonic plague may become septicsemic 
in type, but the disease may be septicaemia from the outset. 
There is some evidence to show that, in the case of primary 
septicDemic plague, infection may take place through the gastro- 
intestinal tract. 

There are thus three recognised forms of plague and of in- 
fection. 

It might be supposed that the flea inoculates the bacillus when 
it bites. This is not the case. What really happens is very in- 
teresting. The flea ucks up blood containing plague bacilli. 
These multiply at its proventriculus, and the bacillary mass 
eventually extends into the oesophagus, thus blocking the 
entrance of the stomach. The starved flea makes violent efforts 
to get more blood, and the oesophageal contents regurgitate, 
thereby infecting through the skin lesion the healthy person on 



97 

whom the flea is trying to feed. The flea itself does not neces- 
sarily die from the obstruction, but it is apt to do so if the 
weather is dry, presumably from lack of fluid. 

Infection may also occur from the bacillus-containing faeces of 
the flea voided on the sk'in and rubbed into the wound. 

When rats become ill or die, the fleas leave them and attack 
man. This is specially true when the epidemic is amongst black 
rats. 

Symptoms. The incubation period is from 2 to 8 days. 
Rarely it may be extended to 15 days, but a quarantine of 
10 days is usually considered sufficient. Prodromata are rare. 

There is an ambulatory form, or Pestis minor, in which the 
fever and prostration are slight. There may be some swelling 
and tenderness of the lymphatic glands, and there is usually at 
the site of the flea-bite the primary vesicle or pustule. It is 
very important to search for this and have it examined bac- 
teriologically. Patients with Pestis minor may suddenly col- 
lapse. They are dangerous, for they act as carrier cases. 

All three forms of Pestis major present certain symptoms in 
common, i.e., sudden onset, sharp fever, vertigo, great prostra- 
tion, a drunken gait, appearance and speech, and great cardiac 
weakness. 

Bubonic Plague. The patient suffers from headache and 
drowsiness and his face is pale and anxious. His features 
become drawn and haggard, his eyes bloodshot, sunken and 
staring, his expression often one of fear or horror. If still able 
to walk he drags himself along like one in a maze or staggers 
about like a drunken person. As the fever increases his face 
gets hot, flushed, and bloated and his pupils dilate. The fever 
curve, as seen by the chart, is irregular and the pulse is rapid 
and weak. Thirst is intense, the furred tongue becoming dry 
and brown and sordes accumulating about the teeth, lips, and 
nostrils. Delirium, and even convulsions, may ensue. The 
spleen and liver are enlarged, the urine scanty, but rarely defi- 
nitely albuminous. 

About the second or third day the chaarcteristic bubo or 
buboes develop. The bubo is most commonly inguinal, but the 
axillary, submaxillary, cervical, or other glands may be involved. 
As a rule, there is only one bubo, which varies from about the 
size of a walnut to that of a goose's egg. The oedema of the sur- 
rounding tissue makes it look larger than it really is. Pain 
varies, but may be very severe. In cases which are going to 
recover improvement sets in about the fourth or fifth day and is 
signalised by a profuse perspiration. The bubo continues to 
nnlarge and soften, and, if not incised, bursts and discharges pus 
and sloughs. From the sixth to the tenth day the temperature 
becomes normal and the patient convalescent. 



Epidemics vary in their symptoms. In some, haemorrhages, 
which may be peteohiae or large purpuric spots or definite bleed- 
ings from the nose, stomach, intestines, &c., occur; in others, 
gangrenous areas of skin occur over and about the suppurating 
buboes; in others, pulmonary congestion and inflammation are 
present. When the case ends fatally death usually takes place 
between the third and fifth days. 

Pneumonic Plague. Rigors and vomiting often characterise 

the onset. Cough, dyspnoea, and cyanosis occur, accompanied by 
a profuse, watery, blood-tinged sputum, which is quite unlike 
the rusty, tenacious sputum of ordinary lobar pneumonia. This 
plague sputum teems with bacilli and is exceedingly dangerous. 
The patient never has a chance. Moist rales are heard over the 
bases of the lungs, the toxaemia is intense, the breathing rapid, 
and death speedily ensues. The type of temperature is shown 
in the chart. 

Septicaemic Plague. In the primary form the patient is at 
once rendered prostrate. His pulse speedily becomes thready or 
imperceptible at the wrist, he is pale and apathetic, and his 
temperature, owing to the magnitude of the infection, may 
scarcely rise at all. Haemorrhages often occur and stupor, coma, 
or delirium herald speedy death. There have been cases where 
intense headache and fever were the only signs and where 
patients died within 48 hours. 

Morbid Anatomy. All that need here be mentioned is the 

marked involvement of the lymphatic system and the destruc- 
tive action of the plague toxin on the endothelial lining of blood- 
vessels and lymphatics. 

Differential Diagnosis. The disease most like plague in its 
early stages is typhus fever. In both there is the same mental 
hebetude and drunken aspect, but the course of the illness and 
the bacteriological examination soon clear up the difficulty. A 
venereal bubo may be mistaken for a plague bubo, a fulminant 
case of enteric for early bubonic plague, and an influenzal pneu- 
monia for pneumonic plague. 

An ordinary septicaemia, some varieties of relapsing fever and 
a pernicious type of malaria may simulate septicaemic plague. 
It is worthy of note that mixed cases of plague and relapsing 
fever are not uncommon. 

Prophylaxis Personal. So far as bubonic plague is con- 
cerned this consists in warding off the attacks of fleas and bed- 
bugs. Pesterine is a good pulicide, and consists of kerosene 
20 parts, soft soap 1 part, and water 5 parts. Dissolve the soap 
in the water and gradually stir the oil into the hot mixture. 
Fleas dislike the smell of iodoform, but so do most people, and 



99 

the free use of iodoform powder would probably lead to an un- 
desired isolation. Naphthalene alone or naphthalene in kerosene 
may be tried. Tricresol powder (3 per cent, cresol powder) has 
been strongly recommended. 

Attendants on plague patients should wear leather or rubber 
gloves, overalls, and be protected about the feet and ankles by 
means of puttees or gum boots. No food or drink should be 
partaken of in plague wards, and hand disinfection is essential. 

For other measures as regards both fleas and bed-bugs see 
section on Insect Pests. 

There are various plague vaccines, the best known being that 
of Haffkine, which consists of the killed bacilli and the chemical 
products of their growth in broth. The Yersin anti-plague serum 
may also be used for prophylaxis. 

Those in contact with cases of pneumonic plague must wear 
masks, goggles, and overalls. 

Prophylaxis General. The usual quarantine period is 10 
days. The bacilli can persist in the bodies of recovered patients 
for three weeks; hence, to be on the safe side, convalescents 
should be isolated for a month. 

The question of the destruction or disinfection of possibly 
infected fomites, such as clothes, skins, rags, &c., is important, 
for under certain conditions the plague bacillus possesses con- 
siderable vitality outside the body. 

Cats and dogs should be kept away from plague patients. 

The great question of rat destruction cannot be here con- 
sidered in detail, but, so far as the use of traps is concerned, 
mention may be made of the value of tomatoes as a bait for 
rats. Portions of tomato can also be treated with phosphorus 
paste or other poison. Scraps of fish are also very attractive 
to rats. After a catch all rat traps should, be immersed in 
boiling water to rid them of the rat smell, which effectually 
prevents the trapping of these suspicious rodents. The use of 
baited birdlime spread on boards has in some places superseded 
that of traps. 

For destroying rats and fleas on shipboard a Clayton apparatus 
is necessary. It generates sulphurous acid gas under pressure; 
3 Ibs. of sulphur per 1,000 cubic feet is the usual allowance. 
A simple and rapid calculation is to allow 3 Ibs. for each 10 
tons of gross tonnage. The fumigation is continued for 12 
hours. 

Rat guards must be fixed on mooring hawsers and cables. 

As regards pneumonic plague the freest ventilation is neces- 
sary, for it is in close atmospheres saturated with moisture that 
infection most readily takes place. 

Treatment. The only treatment which is really of any avail, 
and then only in bubonic plague and when given early, is the

RELAPSING FEVER. 

(SPIROCHAETOSIS.) 



So far there is no record of this disease having appeared amongst 
the troops of the M.E.F. but with the extension of the campaign to 
the Balkans there is every likelihood that cases of what used to be 
failed famine fever will occur. It has been recorded in the past 
from Salonica and Vodena. Like typhus the infection is conveyed 
by lice but unlike typhus the virus is definitely known, being the 
Xpirochaetti ><>< "nr// fits first described by Obermeier. (Fig. 26.) 

Some state that bed-bugs also play a part in the transmission of 
the virus, but recent experiments in Russia tend to disprove this 
hypothesis. It is possible that they are occasionally operative but, 
if so, merely act as direct transmitters. There is no evidence to. 
show that fleas act as vectors. 

Incubation Period. 

This is usually from 5 to 10 days but would appear to vary from 
a few hours to a fortnight. 

Symptoms. 

The onset is very characteristic, being remarkably sudden. The 
patient is taken with a chill or definite rigor, he feels giddy, an 
important symptom, he develops a bad frontal headache, pain in 
the back and limbs and he may and often does vomit. Occasionally 
convulsions herald the attack. A feeling of heat follows. His 
temperature shoots up to 104 or 106 and his pulse grows rapid, 
running at 110 or 120. He becomes seriously ill and is quickly 
prostrated and often delirious. His tongue is moist but coated 
with a white or yellowish fur. It is to be noted that, in contra- 
distinction to what is met with in typhus, the tongue continues 
moist throughout the illness save in very grave infections. The 
patient is constipated, his skin is usually dry and jaundice may 
appear though it is often a mere conjunctival tinge. Thirst, 
restlessness and vomiting, it may be of blood, complete the picture 
but in a minority of cases there is an evanescent rash, either rose 
spots like those of typhoid or a reddish mottling. 

Liver and spleen enlarge. The urine is scanty and high coloured. 
The appetite is poor but occasionally a voracious hunger is 
developed. 

The patient may pass into a toxaemic state with tympanites and 
hiccough and eventually die, but usually, after an elevated tempera- 
ture for 5 or 6 days, the first crisis takes place and is accompanied 



105 

by profuse sweating and sometimes by diarrhoea. The fall of 
temperature, often to subnormal, is both marked and sudden. 
There may be a descent of 10 F. in 24 hours. The change in the 
patient's condition is remarkable. His appetite returns and after 
a day or two he may feel so well that he is keen to get out of bed. 
A f ter a week or so of apyrexia the first relapse occurs. Once again 
the temperature swings up and all the symptoms of the first stage 
are repeated, sometimes in a minor degree. Sweating, however, is 
usually more in evidence and the amount of urine passed is 
increased. 

The temperature remains elevated for 3 or 4 days and then a 
second crisis occurs. The patient may thereafter become 
convalescent or he may have a second and even a third or fourth 
relapse but this is rare in the European form of relapsing fever. 

In protracted cases convalescence is slow but as a rule it is fairly 
rapid and recovery is complete. The spirochaete is found in the 
peripheral blood during the paroxysms, can be stained by the 
Leishman or Giemsa stains, by carbol fuchsin or by alcoholic 
gentian violet. It is best demonstrated by the dark field method 
but with a little care and practice can be detected in an ordinary 
cover glass preparation, especially if a t^th oil immersion lens is 
used, and the film is thin and well spread. 

C omplic a tions . 

Jaundice, severe diarrhoea, epistaxis, hrematemesis and 
hjematuria, parotitis, herpes labialis, pneumonia, meningeal 
irritation and ophthalmia may be mentioned. 

Epidemics vary greatly in intensity. In time of war amongst 
starved and debilitated communities relapsing fever tends to be a 
serious disease, and the mortality, usually slight, may be very 
considerable. 

Differential Diagnosis. 

At the outset the disease may be mistaken for typhoid, typhus, 
or cerebro-spinal fever, but the peculiar course of the temperature 
is characteristic and the discovery of the parasite in the blood 
renders the diagnosis certain. Still it is worthy of mention that a 
recent outbreak at Salonica closely resembled cerebro-spinal fever ; 
stiffness of the neck and hyperaesthesia being prominent symptoms. 
Occasionally relapsing fever may simulate plague and the two- 
diseases may co-exist. 

Treatment. 

Nursing, diet and general hygienic measures as in typhus. 
After the crisis the patient is often ravenously hungry and, if so, it 
is important to regulate his diet carefully as injudicious feeding is 
apt to bring on bad diarrhoea and even dysenteric symptoms. 
Happily we now possess a specific which kills the parasite and cuts 
the disease short. This is salvarsan (kharsivan) which, as soon as 
the diagnosis is made, should be administered intravenously in a 



106 



dose of from 3 to 6 grains. One dose as a rule suffices. Even if 
alburainuria is present this line of treatment is not contra-indicated. 
If relapse occurs the injection should be repeated. Sometimes it 
produces a temporary but short aggravation of the symptoms but 
its action is rapid and certain. Ludyl or galyl may be used if 
salvarsan is not available. They are quite efficient in doses of from 
4 to 7 grains. In debilitated persons camphor, ammonia, digitalis, 
.and stimulants may be indicated. Sometimes the back and limb 
pains demand the exhibition of opium. If hiccough is troublesome 
blistering over the line of the vagus on each side of the neck may 
be tried. 

Prophylaxis. 

The disease being lice-borne this is the same as for typhus fever. 
Remember that the spirochaete has been found in the sweat and in 
the tears and that it has been proved capable of passing through 
intact mucous membranes and the unbroken skin. A case is on 
record where the disease was acquired from infected blood 
accidentally squirted upon the face. 

As bed-bugs may occasionally play a part in the spread of the 
disease measures should be directed against them as well as against 
lice. These will be found detailed in the section on insect pests.

SANITARY NOTES. 



In this section no attempt is made to present an exhaustive 
treatise on camp sanitation. All that is desired is to furnish 
some information likely to be useful to those medical officers 
who have not had much experience in military sanitation under 
semi-tropical conditions. 

The question of the disposal of excreta receives first attention, 
and when one remembers that in the tropics no less than 500 
flies can breed out from a single deposit of human faeces, and 
that 4,000 of these pests can emerge from one-sixth of a cubic 
foot of sewage trench ground, it will be seen that the importance 
of the subject can scarcely be overrated. It is evident that to 
allow men even for a single day to defaecate when and where 
they please, or to permit them to make use of whatever kind of 
latrine appeals to them, is, under most circumstances, a grave 
fault, which may later have to be paid for by discomfort, in- 
validing, and it may be death. 

Although in the trenches nothing of a very elaborate nature 
can be attempted, it should nearly always be possible to ensure 
that receptacles for human ordure have their contents protected 
from flies. At the very least a cap or cover of sacking can be 
improvised, and this may be soaked in cresol solution or in 
kerosene and placed over the tin after use. Any man neglecting 
so to cover a tin should be severely punished, for it is necessary 
to make the punishment fit the crime, and such neglect is a 
serious misdemeanour. A mere reprimand will not impress the 
true heinousness of his offence upon the soldier's mind. 

In many places, however, there will be enough wood to make 
a small fly-proof box for covering and surrounding the tin. The 
lid should be so arranged that when the seat is in use it rests 
against the user's back and falls into position when he rises. 
Now wood soon warps and cracks and shrinks in a semi-tropical 
climate, especially when the nights are cool, and hence it is 
important to see that there are not gaps through which the flies 
rtm gain access to the tin contents. 

(B 5057) I 2 



109 



The latter must be got rid of in the best way possible. As a 
rule, it is found most convenient to pit them. Where it can be 
managed a large and deep pit should be excavated wherein the 
excreta are thrown daily, soil added freely, and kerosene oil 
poured over all. This pit should have a close-fitting cover of 
wood or wood and sacking, and be constructed in a dark place 
where flies are unlikely to congregate. When the deposits have 
reached within 3 feet of the surface the soil should be rammed 
down hard, the pit filled up, the surface soil well soaked 
with kerosene (solar oil is kerosene with the inflammable 
benzines removed), and a new excavation made. Th*e careful 
cleaning of the tins is most important, and if any ground is 
fouled during the process it should be drenched with kerosene. 
Further, the mop or brush or bundle of waste employed must be 
similarly treated. As a preliminary measure some oil can be 
poured into the tin and set alight. This chars the contents and 
facilitates cleansing. 

Where space admits a better method altogether is to excavate 
a kind of alcove at the side of the trench, therein to dig a deep 
latrine pit and to establish over it a proper box seat. A simple 
measure is to have merely a flat, close-fitting wooden cover with 
an opening guarded by a sliding door. The men straddle across 
the opening. If enough wood is not available sacking may be 
employed to remedy the deficiency, as was done in one of the 
trenches at Anzac. 

If, however, there is a sufficiency of timber, then an all-wood 
box should be constructed, and it may be said at once that this 
form which, if properly built and arranged, is fly-proof and wind- 
proof, is admirably adapted to the needs of camp sanitation in 
many places which our troops have to occupy. The only contra- 
indication would appear to be unsuitable ground and the danger 
of fouling shallow wells by drainage from the pit. Fig. 27 
shows the general type, but the urine trough (the opening of 
which into the pit should be plugged when not in use) may often 
be omitted, as a better form of urinal is in vogue, and there is 
no need for the back rest. A little ingenuity will enable the 
lids to be made self-closing, even in its absence. This type of 
box latrine can be made double with two rows of seats back to- 
back. The tin or galvanised iron strip is useful, but not abso- 
lutely essential. It serves to direct the urine into the pit. Note 
the shape of the box. In a single-row seater the back should be, 
well sloped to the rear to avoid soiling with faeces. It is an 
advantage to set the lower box edges well into the soil all round! 
the verge of the pit. If the earth there be crumbly place wooden 
sleepers under the box and have a foot board at the pit edge. 
The seats should be oval in shape, and a space of inch should 



110 



be left at the seat hinges to allow for the swelling of the wood, 
which inevitably follows rain or the use of liquid disinfectants. 

If the available ground is limited, and it can be managed, 
remove the cover every day, fill the pit with combustible mate- 
rial, such as straw, add 1 or 2 gallons of oil, and destroy the 
contents by fire. Otherwise a man must be told off to earth the 
pit thoroughly night and morning and sprinkle some kerosene 
into it. Note that the kerosene so used will not prevent the" 
development of fly maggots if eggs have been laid, but it will, 
and does, keep away egg-laying adult flies. 

When the contents reach to within 3 feet from the surface ram 
down the earth hard, drench with kerosene, dig a new trench, 
and shift the box seat. 

All sanitary paper should be kept in a box with a cover to it, 
and not allowed to become coated with fine 'dust. 

Consider for a moment the disadvantages of such an open 
trench latrine as that shown in Fig. 28. It is offensive to the 
eye, attractive to flies, uncomfortable to the user by reason of 
these very flies, dangerous also because of them, and, despite 
the shielding canvas, on account of soiled toilet paper being 
swirled out of the pit by gusts of wind, and quite possibly 
leading to contamination of food and drink. Moreover, dried, 
infected dust may, in a similar way, be blown hither and 
thither with disastrous consequences. On all counts the open 
trench stands utterly condemned. 

When the nature of the soil prevents the use of deep trenches 
it may be necessary to have recourse to a pail system, for the 
shallow trench should not be permitted in semi-permanent 
camps. At the same time it may be absolutely necessary 
to have recourse to it when troops are on the march. The pail 
system, even with the strictest care and most rigid surveillance, 
has its faults, fur there is always apt to be fouling when the 
contents are emptied and the buckets cleaned, whatever the 
system adopted. The nuisance and danger can, however, be re- 
duced to a minimum if solar oil or petroleum of some sort is 
freely and intelligently used, if, so far as possible, a time of day 
when flies are not very alert is set aside for the process, and if 
the material used in cleaning is subjected to thorough disinfec- 
tion. 

In this connection note the necessity, if the ordinary type of 
seat is employed, of swabbing its under surface well with kero- 
sene or cresol. Pails must be made to fit closely under the 
seats, so that the floor, which should be of concrete, does not 
become fouled by urine. There should be in the floor some kind 
of check, such as an iron stop - pin, against which the base 



Ill 

of the bucket will impinge, thus ensuring that it is in its proper 
place. It is advisable to reduce the seat to a minimum, as the 
less wood the better. The floor washings should be led by a 
channel to a covered pit, and the pit should be made with a 
punch-bowl depression in it to facilitate emptying. 

Paper in the pails should be set on fire thrice daily, as this 
.greatly helps to prevent nuisance and danger from their 
contents. 

Cresol solution is not so good as solar oil or crude kerosene, 
but if it is used the strength should be a quarter of an ounce to 
the gallon, and sufficient should be added to cover the fsecal 
mass. 

In the case of hospital camps and large aggregations of men 
carting of the pail contents to a place of disposal is usually neces- 
sary. Latrine carts are apt to be insanitary Juggernauts, but 
again the use of kerosene will greatly help, as will careful inspec- 
tion to see that the cart is in good condition, that its lid fits 
properly, and that it is thoroughly washed and cleansed and oiled 
well away from camp precincts. Spilling from pails, and also, 
it may be said, from bed-pans being carried to the laboratory, 
constitutes a grave nuisance and danger. 

The trenching ground is another trouble, but here, under 
proper supervision, a system of shallow trenches may have to be 
permitted in lieu of anything better. The discharge of the pail 
contents into large pits, where the surface of the deposits is kept 
covered by a layer of crude petroleum, has something to recom- 
mend it, but without incineration, and indeed even with it, at 
least as usually carried out, the pail system is not an ideal 
method. It need hardly be said that all battered and bulging 
buckets must be at once withdrawn from use, for they are diffi- 
cult to clean, and soon get into a leaky condition. Where the 
pail system is run on a large scale air-tight covers should be 
provided for the buckets, as in the well-known Duckering 
pattern. 

A method for the disposal of pail contents, and which may 
be used in an emergency, is a combination of pitting and 
incineration, and this method, called the " American oil-pit,'" 
may also be used in the case of deep trench latrines, where 
incineration is desirable, and if the fumes are not found too 
disagreeable. For disposal on the large scale, pits 4 feet de'ep, 
and from 10 to 12 feet square, are dug. Each is provided with 
a false bottom of perforated stout gauge corrugated iron sheets. 
The urine runs through the openings. Paraffin oil and other 
combustible material is added and set alight. The burning oil 
evaporates the urine, and the faeces and combustible material 
reduced to ash. 



112 



A more elaborate method, which might be tried in certain 
places, is to have a long, lined pit, 4 feet wide by 21 feet in 
length, with a steel floor, and under it a narrow chamber, 
wherein three " primus " blowers, burning paraffin, generate 
an intense heat. Such oil-pits must be some distance away from 
tents and huts as they are often offensive. 

A recent and ingenious modification of the pail system is that 
introduced by Surgeon-General Macpherson, the type of latrine 
being described and illustrated in the Journal of the Koyal Army 
Medical Corps for October, 1915. By this method latrine con- 
tents are destroyed by individual incineration. The method, 
which is sufficiently indicated in the drawings, Figs, a, b, 
c, d, e, f, g, h and k, is economical and well adapted for 
small units, but requires careful and constant supervision. Dry 
refuse, as well as excreta, should be burned in the incinerators, as 
this helps to dimmish smell, always an objectionable feature of an 
incinerator which does not possess a combustion grid or chamber. 
Where the nature of the subsoil permits, the urine tins may be 
connected with pipes leading directly to a soak-pit, thus further 
simplifying the design. 

Another separation method is that devised by Sharp on the plea 
that it is the admixture of urine with the faeces which causes 
most of the trouble when incinerating. The idea is sufficiently 
indicated by Fig. 29. 

Where the needs of a comparatively small number of people 
have only to be considered, as, for example, in connection with 
a medical or a nursing staff, there seems no reason, provided 
barrels are available, why the system shown in Fig. 30 should 
not be adopted. One of these closet septic tanks has been tried 
at Mudros East, and instead of the wire screen a perforated 
carbide of calcium tin was used quite successfully. The anti- 
splash board, which is pushed down when the closet is not in 
use, may 'be conveniently operated automatically along with the 
lid. If used separately there should be a check, so that it will 
rise to within a couple of inches of the surface of the water and 
no further. The water surface in the barrel must be covered 
b}' a layer of oil to check odour and keep flies away. 

It is wonderful how rarely the barrel has to be cleaned out. 
A metal effluent tank can have its contents boiled, and for this 
purpose may be provided with a water gauge. Then, being harmless, 
the effluent can be discharged anywhere, so long as a mos- 
quito-breeding pool does not result. This is a cleanly and agree- 
able method and requires very little attention. Whatever type 
of latrine be used, it is a good plan to have some place outside 
it where men who may be " carriers " of disease can wash and 
disinfect their hands. Fig. 31 shows a simple arrangement. 



113 

Beturuing to the question of incineration, we may note that 
one of the most satisfactory types of incinerator is the Horsfall, 
which is provided with a baffle plate separating the furnace from 
the bottom of the flue, and thus providing a combustion chamber. 
The ordinary B 3 type readily disposes of the excreta of 1,000 
men per diem, provided the urine is drained away from the 
solids. This is easily done by emptying the pail contents into a 
perforated receptacle kept specially for the purpose. The liquid 
drains away, aided by pressure, and is then run into a funnel 
provided with a sieve, on the top of which a layer of straw or 
:similar material is placed to catch any solids. The funnel com- 
municates with a soak-pit, into which the urine passes, and the 
filtering material is burned. Wood shavings or any kind of com- 
bustible rubbish may be added to the pail contents, which are 
rapidly consumed without the production of any nuisance. 

Emergency " Horsfalls " are easily constructed from bricks or 
petrol cans, filled with a mixture of ash and clay and wired to- 
gether. The all-important point is to ensure that a proper com- 
bustion chamber is present (Figs. 32, 33, 34 and 35), for by its 
means the gases are oxidised and rendered inodorous. 
.* There are many other types of incinerator. The Sialkot 
pattern is well known. The metal receptacle with the tap may 
be omitted, or can be utilized as a source of hot water. There 
are other simpler forms, but none work so well as the properly 
managed Horsfall, and they all require greater care in feeding and 
stoking. 

Much depends on how an incinerator is run, and it is advisable 
to give a little extra pay to the man in charge of it in order to 
secure the best results. 

Urine Disposal. By far the best and cheapest type of camp 
urinal for general use is made by driving a tent peg through the 
bottom of a petroleum drum and setting this at a convenient 
height on a clay pedestal, down the centre of which runs a 
channel formed of ordinary tins attached end to end. This 
communicates with a soak-pit, 3 feet cube, filled with rubble or 
graded stones. Fig. 37 shows such urinals. An alternative 
method, not as easily realised at places like Mudros and the 
P-jiitisuU, is to have funnels communicating with the pit. 

Refuse and Sullage Disposal. Refuse, and especially kitchen 
refuse, is best burnt in a Horsfall, or, failing this, in one of the 
small type incinerators, the cross-bars of which should not be 
set too wide apart. Two inches between each is ample. Wire 
netting can be used if fire-bars are not available, but it soon 
burns out and has to be replaced. 

The best way to get rid of horse manure, which, owing to the 
litter usually mixed with it, may be partly considered under this 



Fig. 37. 




To face p. 113.] 



114 



heading, is a vexed question. Burning is very desirable, but 
difficult of accomplishment unless the mass can be loosened up 
in some way, as by dealing with it on wire netting or spreading 
it out in thin layers. The addition of paraffin is advisable, and 
with care and attention a great deal can be done. The question 
of manure from the fly-breeding standpoint will be discussed 
immediately. 

Sullage is always one of the problems of camp life, especially 
the soapy waste water from laundries and washing benches and 
the greasy sullage from kitchens. 

Methods of disposal must be suited to the locality, and in- 
formation regarding these methods is given with appropriate 
illustrations in the Manual dealing with Koyal Army Medical 
Corps Training, pp. 73-77, and in Major Lelean's " Sanitation in 
War." All that need here be said is that it is advisable to have 
an easily removable wooden box cover over the grease trap in 
places where flies are numerous, and that the absorbent filter 
may consist of grass, straw, hay, small twigs, or any similar 
material, which can afterwards be burned. A useful type of 
washing-trough, lined with zinc and communicating through such 
a grease filter with a soakage pit, is in use in the Indian 
camps at Marseilles. 

Swill tubs and barrels should not have flat wooden lids, which 
warp and crack, but caps made of canvas, which can be soaked 
in kerosene, and which effectually exclude flies. 

Flies. Apart from what is stated in the section on Insect 
Pests, there are some points about flies well worth consideration, 
for remember that flies mean filth, and, what is more, local filth. 
Many of them are bred in filth and begin life infected. All of 
them feed on filth when they can get it, act as mechanical car- 
riers of it, and regurgitate and excrete it, for the fly largely 
spends its day vomiting and defecating. Before feeding, the 
fly imbibes Fquid, and its diet, like that of a typhoid case, is 
fluid. Part of its alimentary tract is really a kind of mixing 
tank, water and liquid food being pumped to and fro in the pro- 
ventriculum before the emulsion reaches the stomach. 

A single female fly lays 120 eggs in one batch, and during the 
year she may lay four such batches. Taking only one batch, let 
us say that half the flies which hatch out, i.e., 60, are females. 
Provided the progeny of those 60 females and that of succeeding 
generations all reach maturity, the original mother fly would in 
six months become the ancestress of no less than 
5,598,720,000,000 adult flies. Consider what this means and 
make the complete calculation for all four batches. It will then 
be evident that delay in fly-prevention is fatal. 

Here is another interesting bit of statistics ! Manure not 



115 

more than 24 hours old produces, during the warm months in a 
temperate climate, an average of 10,000 to 12,000 flies per cubic 
metre. It has been estimated that one horse can produce suffi- 
cient manure to give rise, in summer, to from 40,000 to 50,000 
flies a month, fresh manure alone being suitable for breeding. 
This latter point is important, and in a dry country like Egypt 
horse manure is not such a very marked source of flies. Quite 
recently interesting experiments have been conducted which have 
led to the following conclusions : ' ' The heat of fermentation of 
a manure heap can be used for the destruction of the contained 
larvee. The larva, submitted in the manure to a temperature of 
60 C., and protected from the gases resulting from fermenta- 
tion, dies in 3 minutes; in direct contact with the gases, it dies 
in 1 minute at 61 C., and in 4 or 5 seconds at 60 C. If the 
manure be turned over, larvae which fall into the hot parts of 
the interior are killed instantly. This practice, if carried out 
during the first three days, would result in the destruction of 
90 per cent, of the larvae. The operation is rendered easier if the 
manure coming from the stable be treated directly with the heat 
of fermentation of a heap already formed. The fresh manure 
should be covered by a layer of hot manure about 20 cms. (8 
inches) in thickness; the heat is then readily communicated to the 
fresh material, in which the eggs are killed before they can develop, 
and the fresh material is also protected against further oviposi- 
tion. This biological method of destroying larvas by heat is 
equivalent to an accelerated and total heating of fresh manure up 
to 50 or 60 C., carried out without the expense of any combus- 
tible material." 

Adult flies can be trapped and killed on manure heaps in dry 
weather by placing in inverted tins pieces of bread soaked in 
1 in 40 solution of the commercial (40 per cent.) formalin, to 
which sugar or molasses has been added. On windy days the 
tins should be placed in the lee of the heaps. 

It may be possible, at the early part of the fly season, to trap 
and fumigate adult flies on a large scale by the use of heated 
and baited fly huts, which are so arranged that flies can enter 
them but not leave them. Experiments are now being carried 
out to test their utility. 

Mention may be made of canvas strips or string frames 
poisoned with arsenite of soda solution ; balloon wire fly traps, 
baited with equal parts of cheese and sugar made into a paste 
with water, casein having proved very attractive to flies, or, 
where it can be got, stale beer with sugar ; the use of 5 per cent, 
sweetened formalin solution scattered about in droplets or soaked 
into bits of bread and " swatting " with the wire-netting fly 
flap. 



116 



A word as to cook-houses, which are too often black with flies. 
It is probably a mistake to screen them, for they merely become 
fly traps. It is far better to keep them dark, to arrange for a 
good draught through them when it can be managed, and to 
protect the food itself by wire covers and the provision of 
screened cupboards. It is said that flies are to some extent 
kept out of cattle-sheds by whitewashing the walls with milk of 
lime, to which alum is added in the proportion of 2 Ibs. for 
each 3 gallons of lime, and this mixture might be tried in cook- 
houses, which, in addition, should be sprayed or torched, for at 
dusk it is quite possible to singe and burn large numbers of 
flies on a roof by means of a flaming torch without risk of fire. 
They fall to the ground, and are swept up and destroyed. As a 
spray, Solution " C " or a solution of formalin, 2 ozs. to the 
gallon, is useful. 

Another method for buildings introduced by Major Needham, 
I. M.S., is to catch flies wholesale in a mosquito-net, using it 
opened out as a drag or sweep net. The flies rise, fly into the 
open net, and are then quickly killed by rolling the net up with 
a whirling motion as when handling a skipping net. The dead 
flies can be burned or emptied into a bucket of cresol or kerosene. 
In the case of tents the net is spread over the entrance of the 
tent, and someone inside the tent drives the flies into it, when 
it is rolled up as before. Carcases and carcase flies should be 
sprayed with Solution " C." 

Vermin. Fig. 36 is an illustration of a French modification 
of the barrel disinfector which is very effective, for sulphur 
fumes are deadly to lice. 

In fumigating buildings infested with lice sulphur may be 
used, at least 1 Ib. of sulphur to every 1,000 cubic feet. The 
clothing can be hung up loosely in the building at the same 
time, as the fumes are said to kill both lice and eggs under such 
conditions. 

Water. It is considered unnecessary to enter fully into the 
subjects of water supply and water purification here, for they are 
fully and ably handled in Major Lelean's Manual, which is so 
generally used, but it is well to impress on Medical Officers the 
necessity of making themselves familiar with the rationale* and 
technique of the chlorination process. Many seem to think that 
it is free chlorine which kills the bacteria in the water. This 
would not appear to be so. The bactericidal action is due to 
hypochlorite and to the process of oxidation which tukes place, 
for the total oxygen is liberated from the hypochlorite. It is 
necessary to see that the test solution keeps its strength and 



117 

acts properly, and frequent inspection is always required to 
ensure that the process is properly and intelligently carried out. 
Another point requiring attention is the necessity of cleaning 
out water storage-tanks at definite and not too lengthy intervals. 
When it is remembered that Escomel, in Peru, traced an epi- 
demic of dysenteric diarrhosa to trichomonas flagellates found in 
such tanks, it is clear that every care must be taken. Emptying 
and scouring is usually sufficient, but in case of any suspected 
infection permanganate (1 oz. to 2,000 gallons) or iodine solution 
(1 in 1,000) may be employed.

TYPHUS FEVER. 



While there has been very little typhus fever amongst troops 
serving in the Mediterranean region, it may confidently be expected 
that the disease will be more in evidence throughout the winter and 
in the new area of hostilities. The infection is conveyed by lice 
and it is probable that they constitute the only means of spread. 
The causal organism is not yet definitely known, but the anaerobic 
bacillus recently isolated by Plotz and studied by Olitsky and 
Baehr may prove to be the etiological factor. The evidence 
adduced in its favour is certainly strong. On the other hand, many 
believe that the disease is due to an ultramicroscopic filter-passer 
and its conveyance by, and apparent development in, lice possibly 
favour this hypothesis. 

Incubation Period. 

This varies between 5 and 14 days, 12 days being the usual 
time. 

Symptoms. 

These vary in different outbreaks and an attempt has been made 
to present a composite picture of the disease as it is known to occur 
in Egypt, Serbia, Galicia and the prison camps of Germany. 

The onset may be slight, there being only the discomfort of a 
mild headache, pain in the back together with a loss of appetite, or 
it may be sudden and well marked, the patient suffering from cold 
shivers in addition to the above symptoms, the eyeballs being tender 
on pressure and there being a sense of lassitude, malaise and 
faintness. Occasionally general convulsions passing into delirium 
herald the attack. The period of onset lasts about two days and on 
the third day the symptoms become aggravated and the true signs 
of typhus begin to make their appearance. The patient, though he 
may be going about, has a flushed face and congested eyes. The 
f acies has been described as what might be seen if one could imagine 
a bad cold in the head without catarrh, i.e., with the secretions 
suppressed instead of excessive and the tumidity absent. The 
pulse rate increases while the temperature may still be normal an 
important point in early diagnosis. 

Epistaxis is frequent in some epidemics and may be profuse and 
persistent. 

There is a general reddening of the skin and what has been termed 
a " watercourse " appearance is not uncommon, red channels running 
here and there and combining to form erythematous patches. The 
conjunctivae may become congested and some nasal obstruction 



126 

with slight discharge from the nose may manifest itself. There is 
no splenomegaly at this stage. 

On the second or third day the temperature begins to rise and 
after a morning remission runs up to 103 to 104. Its usual course 
is shown in the charts, the fall being by lysis. There may be a 
preconvalescent rise. 

Cases with remittent temperatures are encountered and these are 
said to do badly owing to cardiac trouble. The urine is normal. 
The rash generally appears on the fifth day, being found rirst on 
the upper part of the abdomen and spreading thence to the chest 
and shoulders. The face remains unaffected. The eruption often 
extends all over the body except the face, but it is more profuse on 
the trunk, especially on the back. The rash tends to be 
polymorphic. In a Galician outbreak the following types were in 
evidence : 

1 . Generalised exanthem on the body. 

(a) Small ruacular type with eruptions of uniform size. 

(b) Large macular type, with various different sixed 

eruptions. 

2. Petech'ial exanthem. 

3. Eruption especially developed on the elbow and upper arm, 

but similar to that on the trunk. 

4. Localised on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, 

with various clinical forms. 

5. Very early-formed small petechiae in pre-existing growths. 

The " mulberry " aspect is by no means always present nor indeed 
is a definite spotted rash. The "watercourse'"' appearance may 
persist and there may be an erythema. At the same time the 
three elements of the "mulberry" can usually be distinguished, 
namely, the rose pink spots fading to a dirty brown or coppery 
hue, the subcuticular mottling and the petechiae. 

As, the rash develops the patient begins to look seriously ill, 
The headache grows more intense and he sinks into the typhus 
state, becoming dull and lethargic with sluggish movements and a 
foul mouth. What with his bloated face and congested skin and 
eyes he looks as though he were drunk. He is difficult to rous : 
and lies on his back with a vacant stare on his' flushed face and it 
may be a tendency to squint ; his voice is husky, his hands arc 
tremulous and he is somewhat deaf. His cerebration is slow, he 
is very thirsty, he can scarcely show his dry, brown tongue and 
there may be detected the curious and characteristic typhus smell, 
aptly described as being like a cupboard full of well-blacked boots. 
There is a certain "tang" in it to which the above simile does 
justice. The breathing is rapid and there is usually some bronchial 
catarrh with cough and thin expectoration. In the second week 
coma, low muttering delirium and retention of urine appear in all 
but the milder cases. At this stage the urine may contain albumin 
and casts and the spleen will be found somewhat enlarged. The 
patient becomes more and more like a log. He is constipated, often 



127 

wets the bed and shows signs of cortical irritation such as 
twitching and hyperaesthesia. 

If he is going to recover a change for the better sets in about the 
fourteenth day, his mind clears and within a week he is hungry 
and convalescent though weak and flabby. If he is going to die the 
coma deepens, his tongue continues dry and crusted, the temperature 
remains elevated or rises and the heart fails. Sometimes a patient 
will die after the crisis from exhaustion or complications. There 
is some evidence to show that the virus remains in the body for 
three weeks after the fever abates. 

While the above description is that of a more or less typical case, 
of typhus it must be remembered that there are mild cases without 
much nervous upset or prostration, cases almost devoid of a rash, 
fulminant cases with early and violent delirium which perish 
quickly an I what has been called the "high-tension type," with 
very severe headache and photophobia lasting throughout the entire 
pyrexial period, no delirium but mental irritability. The pulse is 
relatively slow but very full and bounding. 

Complications. 

Hypostatic congestion of the lungs, venous thrombosis, otitis 
media, parotitis and bed sores and gangrene of the feet may be 
mentioned. Diarrhoea is sometimes so profuse as to require 
treatment. The disease may be followed by peripheral neuritis 
and distressing neuralgias, but the convalescence is usually rapid 
and complete. 

Prognosis. 

The majority of cases recover. Those which develop early 
delirium are very apt to die. 

Diagnosis. 

As an aid to diagnosis the production of artificial stasis of the 
vessels is said to be useful. Where the rash is not characteristic or 
is sparingly developed place a bandage round the arm. The 
resulting engorgement of vessels shows np the exanthem more 
clearly and the red maculae can be observed to take on a blue, 
yanotir hue, which eventually changes to the brown or coppery 
colour already mentioned. 

Differential Diagnosis. 

Typhus has specially to be distinguished from typhoid and para- 
typhoid, while it may also be mistaken for lobar pneumonia, 
influenza, cerebro spinal fever, measles, relapsing fever (also lice- 
borne), plague and septicaemia. 

Treatment. 

< Jood nursing is of the utmost importance. The diet should be 
strengthening and at fii'st should consist of milk, Benger's food, 
malted milk, Brand's essence and nourishing soups. It is essential 



128 

to keep the mouth in a good condition. For this purpose it should 
be washed out with hydrogen peroxide or some other disinfectant, 
the throat should be swabbed frequently and the patient encouraged 
to gargle if he can manage it. A mouth salve of a few drops of Ol. 
menth. pip. in vaseline is comforting. Stimulation is often required 
but care must be taken that brandy and strychnine do not aggravate 
the cerebral condition. Indeed it is better to avoid strychnine in 
typhus. Digitalis or digitalin are indicated. Camphor is probably 
the best stimulant to employ. 10 to 20 minim doses of ether 
subcutaneously have been found useful. 

The patient should have abundance of fresh air, be carefully and 
frequently turned on his side, be given ice to the head and sponged 
at frequent intervals. 

It would seem that morphine, save where definitely contra- 
indicated, is the most valuable drug in typhus, but it is worth 
noting that cases have recently been successfully treated by the 
subcutaneous injection of normal horse serum free of phenol. The 
dose is 1 c. c., increased if necessary to 3 c. c. 

Intravenous administration of typhoid vaccine has been used in 
Bulgaria and is said to be distinctly beneficial. 

A sensitised vaccine has been employed, but this is probably an 
unnecessary refinement and doses varying from 100 million to 500 1 
million of a stock vaccine might be tried. They are unlikely to do- 
any harm. In cases where there has been much toxaemia together 
with a low blood pressure the early intravenous transfusion of 
normal saline has been known to give very satisfactory results. 

Prophylaxis. 

Some recent work strongly indicates that in quinine we may 
possess a preventative of real value in typhus. It has been given 
on several occasions in a daily dose of 3 grains continued for 21 
days to persons infected with lice or who have been in contact with 
typhus cases, and apparently with the happiest results. It is 
certainly worth a trial. To get rid of lice the use of verniijelli,, 
Oxford powder and the N.C.I, mixture, guaiacol or menthol, is 
recommended. (See Section on Insect Pests.) 

Other prophylactic measures may be briefly indicated. Those in 
attendance on the sick should be protected from lice by overalls 
with trousers tucked into gum boots and rubber gauntlet gloves. 
The overall should fasten closely round the neck. The head should 
be protected by a close-fitting cap to batHe head lice. 

Patients on admission should be carefully washed, the hair of the 
scalp cut short and treated with Linimentum saponis and, where 
necessary, the hair of the face, the axilla and pubis shaved. Such 
hair should be collected and burnt. It seems advisable to rub the 
patient all over with 10 per cent, camphorated oil, or to spray him 
or rub him down with kerosene, benzine or gasoline. His night- 
shirt or pyjamas should at first be searched for Ike to make sure 
none have escaped. 



129 

As regards -clothes and bedding, it is said that spraying with 10 
per cent, formalin is effective, but it is better to rely on the Thresh, 
or the box or barrel disinfector, which operate by means of current 
steam. (See Sections on Camp Sanitation and Insect Pests.) 
Cotton fabrics may be boiled for 10 minutes in water containing 70 
grains of carbonate of soda to If pints. It is well to remember 
that the patient probably harbours the virus for three weeks after 
the temperature has reached normal and that so far as experimental 
work has gone there seems reason for believing that the infection 
is hereditary in the louse. The period of quarantine is 16 days 
and, to be on the safe side, isolation should continue for 5 weeks.

UNDULANT FEVER. 



This long continued fever is commonly known as Malta Fever, 
and has also been termed Mediterranean Fever and Gastric 
Bemittent Fever amongst other titles. It has a wide geographical 
distribution and is known to occur throughout the eastern 
Mediterranean. Cases have cropped up amongst British troops 
operating in this area. 

The cause is the Micrococcus melitensis and its variety J/. para- 
melitensis, minute cocci or cocco-bacilli which are found in the blood 
and give rise to an acute or chronic septicaemia. Goats are apt to 
harbour the organism and excrete it in their milk, so much so that 
the drinking of goats' milk is one of the principal methods of 
acquiring the disease. As in typhoid, food, fingers and flies are all 
probably operative in spreading infection for, apart from milk, its 
products, such as cream and cheese, may harbour the organism ; 
surface soil and dust may become contaminated from the urine of 
human beings, goats and other ruminants suffering from the disease 
and so lead to food infection ; carrier cases doubtless play a part ; 
and flies may acquire the micrococcus from the urine or faeces. 
Infection can take place through the skin and mucous membranes. 

The urine of ambulant human cases is, during war time, in all 
probability a special source of danger. The organism is fairly 
resistant outside the body. It is worth nothing that, in addition 
to man and goats, cows, sheep, horses, mules and dogs are all 
liable to natural infection. 

Symptoms. 

Incubation period of 5 to 15 days followed by headache, insomnia, 
malaise and anorexia. Constipation is the rule and there is early 
splenomegaly and tenderness over the spleen. The temperature, of 
a remittent type, gradually rises, strongly suggesting the onset of 
typhoid. There may be epistaxis and slight bronchitis and cough 
with profuse night sweats are not infrequent. The tongue is 
flabby and coated, with red tip and edges. Even at this stage 
joint troubles and neuralgia may put in an appearance but they are 
usually deferred till "a later period. After rising for 3 or 4 days by 
a step- like ascent the temperature falls by a similar descent which 
reaches normal on or about the tenth day. 

The symptoms abate, the patient feels better for a few days but 
the night sweats and the emaciation, which sets in early, continue 
and then the first of a long series of relapses manifests itself. 
(See Chart I.) 



133 

During these relapses the joint troubles arise, one joint usually 
being involved. There is no redness but the part is swollen and 
there is effusion with severe pain. The condition is transient 
asting a few days but too often re-appearing in another articulation, 
which not infrequently is the costo-sternal. 

At the same time neuralgic pains set in, the peripheral nerves 
being specially affected and the sciatic often involved. 

A Ibuminuria may be present and orchitis occasionally occurs as a 
late symptom. 

The febrile waves follow each other at short intervals and the 
disease runs its wearisome aveiage course of 60 to 70 days, which 
may, however, extend to well-nigh a year. Naturally the patient 
becomes anaemic, he suffers from palpitation, his pulse is rapid and 
irregular. Mental depression lays hold of him and it is important 
to remember that he may become a victim of the morphia habit. 
His blood shows an increase of lymphocytes and a corresponding 
reduction in polymorphs. 

While this is the usual undulatory fever the disease may be 
ambulant in type or there may be an intermittent form running a 
mild course or the attack may be malignant with a liigh continued 
fever, pulmonary complications and a tendency to hyperpyrexia. 
The intermittent form is apt to be puzzling as the morning 
temperature may be normal or sub-normal and the evening rise 
slight. Except in the malignant form the ultimate prognosis as 
regards life is good, only about 2 or 3 per cent, of the cases ending 
fatally. 

Differential Diagnosis. 

Save where laboratory facilities are available it is not always easy 
to diagnose undulant fever. It is apt to be mistaken for typhoid, 
paratyphoid, sub-tertian malaria, influenza, hepatic abscess, tuber- 
culosis, especially phthisis, and, in certain regions, kala-azar. 

The history and careful clinical observation will usually help to 
clear up the case but in no disease is bacteriological investigation 
more important. 

Prophylaxis. 

As for typhoid, special attention being paid to the disinfection 
of the urine. Isolation of human carriers if they can be found. 
Boiling of goats' milk, the slaying of infected goats and the 
avoidance of local products of milk. Personal cleanliness as a 
preventive is just as important as in typhoid. 

Treatment. 

Until recently this was entirely symptomatic. Yeast may be 
tried in 2 drachm doses for the purpose of increasing the polymorphs 
and reducing the tendency to neuritis. Intravenous injections 
of starch have been recommended. Cryogenin, as mentioned 
under Dengue, may be used with care as an antipyretic. Aspirin 



134 

and phenacetin are not over-safe considering the cardiac weakm^s 
Morphia, may be necessary but the risk of the morphia habit being 
acquired in tin's disease, should be remembered. The insomnia lias 
to be combated by the usual hypnotics and cardiac tonics are often 
indicated. Cold sponging'aud local anodynes for joint and nerve 
pains are useful. Depressing drugs such as quinine and the salicylates 
are harmful. 

Though a serum has been tried with some success vaccine-therapy 
is probably the most promising line of treatment. It is said that 
sensiti/ed vaccinies act best. In any case the vaccine treatment is 
best left to an expert and as cases of undulant fever should 
practically always be sent to England as soon as possible this can 
be arranged without difficulty. 

A chart is given showing the beneficial results of this line of 
treatment in a couple of cases reported by Fleet-Surgeon P. W. 
Bassott-Smith, C.B., R.N.
