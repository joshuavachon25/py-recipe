PEEFACE. 



Having bad mariy. years' experience as a 
baker and confectioner, I claim to under- 
stand the business in all its branches. 

Every recipe contained in this work is a 
genuine and well-proportioned mixture that 
contains nothing but what is essential to its 
perfection. The ingredients have been 
tested thousands of times, and every one can 
use them with the assurance that, if the 
directions are observed, the result will be 
satisfactory. 

There are many books of recipes that 
have been compiled, not by persons practi- 
cally acquainted with the business, but by 
mere book makers^ and are filled up with 
many worthless recipes that are not reliable, 
either for their ingredients or their propor- 
tions. This book is free ofall such untried and ! 
impracticable mixtures, and is valuable for ! 
not only what it does, but what it does not \ 

i^ ou) ^ 



iv PREFACE. y 



contain. Follow the directions here given, 
and you will be sure not to waste time and 
ingredients on worthless mixtures, but have 
an article worth eating. 

I use carbonate of ammonia for raising 
many of my fine cakes — an essential ingre- 
dient for a perfect cake. 

There are many recipes in this book of 
great value to families, as well as to bakers 
and confectioners, that have been sold for 
ten dollars each, and that are now published 
for the first time.
