PREFACE. 

TH E Book, the Tranflation of which makes a 
material Part of this Work, is rhe iaft Pro- 
duclion on French Cookery, printed in Paris, fay the 
King's Privilege, intitled, LES SOUPERS DE LA COUR. 
I fhall not pretend to make any further Apology for 
the Title of Supper, than that the French are, in gene- 
ral, more elegant in their Suppers than Dinners. I 
procured it from France for my own Help and In- 
ftruction, as a Clerk of the Kitchen ; and finding it 
of great Utility, I thought that a Tranflation would 
be both agreeable and ufeful to many Gentlemen, 
Ladies, and others, as it contains the greatefl Number 
of the mod approved and neweft Receipts in Cookery, 
Paftry, and Confectionary, of the prefent Time ; and 
as Bills of Fare are moftly made in French, Talfo 
thought it very neccflary," and of particular Ufe, to 
retain all the French Names and Appellations, giving 
at the fame Time a literal Tranflation, or the Mean- 
ing from whence derived, by which I hope to be 
allowed the Exprefiion of reconciling the Englifli 
Maitre ff Hotel to the French -Cook. Although it 
may be faid, that great Numbers of thefe Re- 
ceipts were known by the fame Names Years ago, 
the Truth of which I am very fenfible of; yet I am 
alfo certain, that the Performance is very different, 
and in a much genteeler Tafte, than is to be found in 
any Books treating on Cookery, &c. having examined 
many prior to this, as La Cwfine Royak, Le Mailre 
Hotel Cuifmier, and Les Dons de Comus -, of which this 
Book may be called the E/ence, with Improvements. 
Gentlemen and Ladies are liable to Deception, in fee- 
ing their Bills of Fare, not caring to enquire into the 
particular Merit of every Difh, which often takes its 

a 2 Name 



IV 



PREFACE. 



Name from the Inventor, or the Perfon of Confe- 
quence whofe Palate it pleafed firft, and under a pom- 
pous Name often proves not worth the Executing. 
By referring to the different Kind of Meat propofed, 
every Body may eafily find out any particular Diih, or 
what may be mod agreeable to furnifh their Tables 
with. It is more particularly ufeful to the Englifh 
Cooks, Houfe-keepers, and every one employed in 
providing and making Bills of Fare, who have not 
had an Opportunity of being acquainted with French 
Cookery. When Dinners and Suppers are to be dreffed 
by Cooks hired for the Time, they are moflly allowed 
to make the Bill of Fare : This Book will greatly afllft 
the Houfe-Servant how to provide the proper Ne- 
cefiaries for the Execution of it -, the Mafler will find 
what Provifions are to be allowed, and the Servants 
will receive great Affiftance for the Performance of 
their Duty in each Station : Clerks of the Kitchen, 
whofe Duty it is to make Bills of Fare, and to pro- 
vide accordingly, will alfo find it of very great Ufe i 
as, by this Means, Concord and Unanimity will reign 
between Cook and Provider, which, if either is de- 
ficient in his Bufinefs, often creates difagreeable Alter- 
cations to Mafters and Miftrefies, by Changes and 
other Inconveniences more to be attended to. I have 
myfelf, as well as many others, been Witnefs of the 
Diffidence of Englifh Cooks, in looking at Bills of 
Fare, of which they had probably executed the whole 
feveral Times, only under different Denominations. 
This has been my greateft Inducement to retain all the 
French Names as in the Original, and to render their 
Meanings in Englifh as concifely as I was able ; al- 
though many which go by certain Appellation, which 
cannot be rendered into Englifh with any tolerable In- 
terpretation (at leait by me) being frequently adopted 
from proper Names or Titles, they foon will become 
familiar to every common Underftanding, being moflly 
adopted in the Englilh Language already, at leaft in 

Terms 



PREFACE. v 

Terms of Cookery, &c. The French Cook (how far 
this may pleafe him) will lofe nothing by the Perufal, 
as very few are thoroughly acquainted with the Whole, 
and will help the Memory to great Advantage : There 
is (till Room in Abundance for thofe who have Under- 
Handing, and Inclination for Improvement. To the 
Complete Cookery, the Author has a!lb added CONFEC- 
TIONARY -, in which I have been more particularly 
exact, as knowing it to be very much wanted among 
Englifli Servants. Ladies who delight in the profitable 
Amufement of making their own Sweet-meats, and 
Houfe-keepers, whofe Bufmefs it is in mod Families 
in England, will find it of very great Utility, not only 
for the Number of different Receipts, but the par- 
ticular Methods of preparing the Sugar, by which 
they will fave the Trouble and Expence of renewing 
their Summer's Work in Winter, as the Sugar being 
prepared according to the Method laid down in this 
Book, will keep the Sweet-meats of any Kind in their 
proper Colours and Goodnefs for Years. 

A tedious Collection of Bills of Fare would, I am 
perfuaded, be unneceiTary, as a fertile Imagination, 
and a LARDER provided accordingly, is the only Rule 
that can be given for furniming a Table properly, 
confidering the Company, and the Size of the Dimes 
which are to be ufed. 

I beg the Candour of the Public will excufe the In- 
correctnefs of the Language and Diction. My Ina- 
bilities, and Situation in Life, as an actual Servant to 
the Earl of Afhburnham at the Time of the firft Publi- 
cation of this Book, will, I truft, plead my Apology -, 
and I hope it will be found eafy to all common Urider- 
ftandings, for whofe peculiar Service it is intended. 

As every Country produces many Articles peculiar 
to itfelf, and confidering the Difference of Climates, 
which either forward or retard them, I would not rely 
abfolutely on my own Knowledge, in regard to each 
Article ; I applied therefore to three Tradefmen, all 

a 3 eminent

try, and one for the Productions of the Garden, viz. 
Mr. Humphrey Turner, Fifhmonger, in St. James's- Mar- 
ket ; Mr. Andrews, Poulterer, in ditto , and Mr. Adam

Rice, Green-Grocer, in St. Albany-Street , to all whom I 
ani particularly thankful for their ready Compliance, 
equally for myfelf, as for all thole who may hereafter 
make uk of this Book, as a Guide to Market. 

The Encouragement this Work has met with, by the 
Sale of two Editions in a fliort Time, having far ex- 
ceeded my own Expectations, in Obedience to the 
Senfe of my Friends, I have now put my Name to this 
revifed Edition.

TH E Spring is the firft and moft promifing Seafon of the Year, 
although the molt confined in its Productions, in regard to 
Poultry, Fruits, and Gardenings ; it comprehends, March, April>

Butcher's Meat through the whole Year. I mall take no further No- 
tice of thefe Articles, than that London has the Advantage of Parti, 
in the Articles of Veal and Lamb, which are to be had in London all 
the Year ; an Advantage to Entertainments, which the French have 
not. To render this in the eafieft Manner I am able, I mall take

Care to fkim it very well, then add Roots and Herbs 
as you think proper, viz. Leeks, Carrots, Parfneps, a 
Head of Celery, Parfley-roots, large Onions fluck with 
a few Cloves, and a little Parfley and Thyme tied toge- 
ther ; you may boil in this Broth whatever you pro- 
pofe to ferve in the Soup, fuch as Fowls, Pigeons, 
Partridges, &c. taking particular Care that the Broth 
be very clear, well tailed, and not too mueh of the 
Herbs or Roots. It ferves you to fimmer your Soups, 
being coloured and ftrengthened with a little Gravy ; 
and alfo to make the liquid of Sauces. 

Bouillon a la hate.

f UT fmall Slices of a Fillet of Veal, lean Meat of 
Beef, Carrots, Celery, iliced Onions, a Couple of 
middling Turnips, one Head of Clove; garnifh the 
Bottom of a Stew-pan with a few Slices of Lard * ; 
then put in the Meat and Roots ; foak it on a middling 
Fire, until the Meat begins to catch at the Bottom of 
the Pan ; then poor fome boiling Water on it, and let 
it boil fmartly about half an Hour, or more ; add fait, 
fkim it, and fift it clear for Ufe. 

* The Lard here meant, is the Fat of Bacon cured without being 
fmoked, for the Ufe of Cookery ; and is to be underftood as fuch in 
every inftance throughout this Work. 

Bouillon au Bain-Marie.

Water ; cut Slices of Beef, Fillet of Veal, half a 
Barn-door Fowl or Capon, a large Onion ftuck with one 
or two Cloves, and a few Bits of Roots ; boil it in that 
Manner for five or fix Hours, taking Care to fupply

are not common in England, that will ftand the Fire for this Purpofe ; 
but Copper ones will anfwer the fame End with Care. 

Confomme* 
Jelly Broth. 

pUT into your Pot or Stew-pan Slices of Beef, of 
Veal Fillet, a Fowl, and one or two Partridges, 
according to the Quantity required ; put it on the Fire 
without Liquid until it catches a little, and turn the 
Meat now and then, to give it a proper Colour ; then 
add fome good clear boiling Broth, and fcalded Roots, 
as Carrots, Turnips, Parfneps, Parfley-roots, Celery, 
large Onions, two or three Cloves, a fmall Bit of Nut- 
meg, and whole Pepper ; boil it on a flow Fire about 
four or five Hours with Attention, and add a few Cloves 
of Garlick or Shallots, and a fmall Faggot, or Bunch 
of Parfley and Thyme, tied together ; when it is of a 
good yellow Colour, fift it. It ferves for Sauces, and 
to add Strength to your Soups, particularly thofe made 
of Herbs or Italian Pafte. 

N. B. I am very fenfible that many People (more particularly in 
England,) have an Averfion to the Tafte or Smell of Garlick ; I 
neverthelefs prefume to fay, that its Effects are very good when uied 
with Moderation, and will make either hot or cold Dimes very agree- 
able, as Experience will (hew. , Tafte muft direct, without which no 
Cookery can be good.

general Cullis ; when the Glaze is formed in the 
Stew-pan, add Broth according to the Quantity requir- 
ed ; trim off the Tails of half a hundred of Craw-fifti, 
pound the Infide of the Bodies, and dry the Shells on 
the Fire, or in the Oven, to pound with the reft ; fift

for the fake of giving a proper Colour to any Sauce ; excepting thofe 
Coulis made of Roots or Seeds, which I have diftingu.ifhed by the 
Name of Porridges and Puree. The fecond is flronger of Meat, and is 
for the Purpofe of adding Goodnefs and Strength to whatever it is 
mixed with. The laft is for the fame Purpofe, and made as rich in 
Tafte and Flavour, as Meat, Poultry, Game, and proper Seafoning can, 
make it, from which it has the Name of Reftorative. This is the true 
Foundation of Cookery, and wherein every one ought tp be as perfect

[AT. B. In Thefe true Tafte Ihews itfelf, and muft 
meet with Approbation or Condemnation. As all boiled 
Meat, dewed, or brazed, is to be made relifhing, with 
the Addition of a well-timed good Sauce ; and as it is 
abfolutely impoffible to direct Quantities fo minutely as 
to agree with different Palates, I lhall ftrongly recom- 
mend to all Cooks of either Sex, to keep their Stomachs- 
free from ftrong Liquors, and their Nofes from Snuff.]

commended in Italian Dimes ; but it cannot be had fo good here, for 
which Reafon Butter ought to be preferred.

De la Connolffance & Dijjeflion du Cochon* 
How to chufe Hogs Meatj and to cut it up. 

OOG's Meat ought to hard and of a fine blooming 
colour, without any bad fmell occafioned by heat; 
that which is foft and of a pale red is not good ; nei- 
ther is it wholefome when Imall white fpots appear in 
the fleih. Pigs of fix or eight months old, are fit for 
pickled Pork, or to roaft ; thofe of a year or fifteen 
months, are better to make Bacon : Sucking Pigs 
fhould be about three weeks old, and are to be taken 
from the fuck for ule. All the meat employed for 
Saufages or Puddings, ought to be ufed direftly, the 
Guts particularly, as by keeping they apt to heat, and 
to burft. The Diflcdlion of the Urne is to be cut 
dole to the Ears quite through ; the Neck ferves for 
Haflets ; and the Ham is always cut intd thin flices 
for eating, mixing fat and lean. The Wild Boar is cut 
the fame way as the Hog, and the Marcajjln (or Sucking 
Wild Boar) is drefled the fame as the Sucking Pig. 

I lhall pafs over any further directions ; as every 
country has different ways of cutting up all forts of 
animals. A little attention to the practice will be of 
more fervice than all the theory that . can be given ; 
and found very ufeful, more particularly in the country.

trufs it with three fkewers, one in the hind Leg, one 
in the fore, and one in the middle ; put into it a fag- 
got of Pariley, Shallots, Thyme, Laurel, with Pepper 
and Salt, and wipe it very dry before fpitting : cut 1 
the Skin a little near the Neck, and alfo near the 
Rump, to hinder it from breaking in roafting ; when 
it begins to be warm, rub it all over pretty often with 
Oil, which will make the Skin very crifp ; take out 
the faggot when you ferve it up. The Englilh method 
of fluffing it is with Sage and Onions, Pepper and Salt.

before it is ufed. The beft part of the Boar is the 
Head, which is moftly brazed and ferved cold. The 
Fore-quarter is larded, roafted, and ierved with a fharp 
Sauce in a Boat : the Hind-quarter is drefled as a la 
Mode Beef, or Dobs; and alib prepared as Pickled 
Pork. Any further direction is of very little ufe in 
England, as what we fee here comes from abroad, 
which is feldom any thing elie but the Head. The 
Germans are beft acquainted with their different qua- 
lities and ufes, and make thofe fmoaked Saufages of 
Wild Boar's Flelh, which are much efteemed, both 
in England and other countries. 

Sanglier a la Daube.

fliced Onions, all forts of Roots, a large faggot of 
fweet Herbs, Cloves, whole Pepper, and Trimmings 
of any forts of Meat; foak it about half an hour, 
then add two or three glafles of Brandy, a pint of

gord being a Province in France, where Truffles are 
very good, and in great abundance.) You may either 
roaft or braze them, and ferve with a Ragout of 
Truffles, as directed in Ragout Articles. Thole Pe- 
rigord Difhes are feldom prepared in England, where 
Truffles are fo very dear, and fo different in flavour to 
foreign ones. It is much the fame with Italian Difhes, 
where Oil is in the composition ; but, as excellent 
Butter is to be had in England, at all times of the 
year, it may very well fupply the want of good Oil 
in Cookery. Alib thofe Difhes under the denomina-

N. B. Although a particular Cullis is directed for each Ragout, it 
is not abfolutely neceflary, as a good Cullis is one of the principal 
Articles in Cookery ; it is always made, where Made-diflies are 
wanted, and may ferve for all thofe Ragouts, with a little Attention 
to what is drefling ; as fome forts of things require to be made mor 
relifhing than others : The addition of fweet Herbs called Ravigettf, 
Lemon, or Verjuice, is fufficient to give the difference of tafte to each 
particular; the Profeffed Cook knows it, fo will th$ Learner witl\a

Du ROT i, d? de la Faqon de lepreparer* 
Of Roaft, and how to prepare each Kind. 

A LTHOUGH it feems very eafy to roaft any kind of 
Meat, neverthelefs there is a certain point of roaft- 
ing very necelfary to be obferved, according to the 
quality of the Meat, fo that it may be ferved with its 
proper flavour and goodnefs. Large pieces are only 
to be judged of by the time, or feeling under the 
finger, and are very forward when they begin to burft 
into fmall fmoaking bladders ; a little ufe and proper 
attention will guide the young Cook, in point Of time, 
to the greatefh exadtnefs. 

I will give directions for preparing Poultry and 
Game. As each feafon furniihes fome things diffe- 
rent, it will not be unneceflary to exhibit a few exam- 
ples of what we can give for Roaft, and of the choice 
of each feafon in the year. 

So far the Author. As a Tranflator, I found it 
neceflary to be particularly acquainted with the Eng- 
lifti productions of this kind, as is already mentioned 
in my Preface. And although thefe are before given 
with other productions, I fhall here lay down each 
article, whereby feafonable Roaft may be more readily- 
found out. 

Du Printems. 
Of the Spring. 

'"pHE production of Poultry, according to the Lon- 
don market, in the Spring are, Ducklings fcalded, 
Green-Geefe, Turkey-polts, wild Pigeons, tame Pi- 
geons, Squab ditto, Quails, wild Stop-rabbits, Gui- 
nea Fowls, Pea Fowls, Capons, Pullards, Pullets with 
Eggs, Spring Fowls, and Chickens. 

N. B. Wild Ducks, Teals, Widgeons, Eafterlings, Dun-birds, Bof- 
lards and Woodcocks, are going out of feafon. Other articles to 

y be 



322 'Ike PROFESSED COOK. 

be had of the Poulterers are, a difti of Combs, fat Livers, knots of 
Eggs, Turkey Pinions, Leverets, Plovers Eggs, and Rabbits. 

De FEte. 
Of Summer. 

r>RY-PULL'D Geefe and Ducks, wild Rabbits, 
Wheat-cars, wild Pigeons, Fowls, dry-pulled Tur- 
kies, tame Pigeons, large Fowls, middling Fowls, 
Chickens, Guinea Fowls and Chickens, Quails, Leve- 
rets. Giblets to be had of the Poulterers.

Rabbits, ditto Ducks, (dry - pulled Gccfe and 
t)ucks, though almoft out of feafon) 'Larks, Snipes,; 
Wood-cocks, Plovers^ Billiards, Capons, Pulbrds, 
middling Fowls, Chickens, Quails, Pheaiants, Par- 
tridges, Hares. Although fome few of thefe articles do 
not abfolutely agree with the Game At, they never- 
thclefs are in fealbn at prefent. 

N. B. Pheafants, Partridges, and Hares, are not be found at 
market. 

De la Preparation de toules Sortes de Rotis. 
Of the Preparation of all Sorts of Roaft. 

pOULTRY ought to be kept without food for five 

or fix hours before killing , pluck it dirctftly after, 

and draw the Guts, then hang it up in a cool place ; 

keep 



The PROFESSED COOK. 

1 keep it as long as the weather will permit, and it will 
be tenderer and better tailed. When you prepare it 
for uie, begin to draw by the Giggard ; thrufting one 
finger round, to loofen the Infiqle, fo that it may come 
out eafily. Large Pullards are opened at the fide, 
and letier ones at the end, as is uiual in England. 
Singe the Poultry over the fire all round, and wipe it 
clean with a cloth ; then trufs it properly, either for 
boiling or brazing, which is the fame; or for roafting, 
which is different. All forts of Roaft fhould be done 
with a- fire as equal, during the roafling, as it is pof- 
fiblc to keep it, and finiflied of a fine pale brown 
Colour, except it is to be ferved with any forts of 
Ragout ; then obferve the feveral directions in Fowl 
Articles already given. The fat Livers, which you 
draw, fhould be rolled up in their own Fat, if you 
have no immediate occafion for ufing them. 

Wild Pigeons are roailed quite freih out of the neil ; 
when they are plucked and clrawn, cut off the Pinions, 
N.eck and Claws ; roll them up in Vine-leaves, and a 
flice of Bacon quite round; when they are alined 
done, ilrew Bread Crumbs over them, give them a 

food brown Colour, and ferve cither with or without 
uuce. 

Tame Pigeons. Gut them as foon as killed, take out 
the -Craw, and keep them fome time before ufing. 

Wood-pigeons, Tknjhes, and Moor-bens are done the 
fame. 

Turkey Polts are prepared in the fame manner as 
Fowls and Chickens. 

Lamb ought to be kept fome time, and roafted flow- 
ly, as all fucking Meat ought to be ; the Fore-quar- 
ter is the moil eilcemed, and of greater uiQ for variety 
in Cookery.

Des Oifeaux de Riviere. 
Of Frelh- water Fowls. 

LD and tame Ducks, Teals, &c. &c. All thofe 
kind of Fowls, when well plucked and drawn, 
fhould be trufled with the Legs undermoft, and roaft- 
cd without any thing: They require but a Ihort 
time to be done, as they ought to be full of their own 
Gravy ; which will wafte if too much roafted. 

Des Oifeaux que Von fert avec des Roties dejjbus. 
Of Birds, which are ferved with a Toad under them. 

T ARKS. They ought to be fat and frelh killed; you 

may lard or bard them, and roaft them with a 

Toaft under ; or roaft them wrapped in Vine-leaves 

and a dice of Bacon, ftrewed with Bread Crumbs^ and 

ferved with the fame. 

Avails are done in the fame manner. 

Reals, Wood-cocks , and Snipes, muft be trufled with 
the Legs undermoft, the Bills ferve for a fkewer ; lard 
the Breaft-part if agreeable, and roaft them without 
drawing, with toafted Bread under. 

Wheat-ears, when in full feafon, may be called the 
Ortolans of England, and may be drefled in the fame 
manner as Larks. 

Partridges are drawn like Chickens, and ought to 
be fpared in the bailing, as too much of it will waftc 
Che flavour ; finge them over a charcoal-fire before 
roafting, larded or barded. The fame obfervation is 
neceflary in balling Hares and Rabbits, and all Game 
of high flavour. It is to be obferved, that the female 
of Poultry and Game is in general more delicate than 
the male, and ought to be kept as long as pofEble, 
for the fake of tendernefs and flavour.

Plaice may alfo be dreflfed the fame, at leaft what

are much larger, and very good when quite frefh, firm, 
and not fpent by long keeping, which may foon be 
diftinguifhed by the hardnefs of the flefhy part ; but 
when watery ftreaks appear through the fkin, they 
arc flak. 

The Carlets, viz. Flounders, are efteemed by mofl 
people to be better Fifh than Plaice ; they ought to 
be chofen by the fame rules, and they may be diftin- 
guifhed from the Plaice, by having lefs fpots, fmaller,

De la Vive. 
Of the Fifh called Weaver. 

*T'HIS Fifh is not efteemed in England, nor is it very 
common ; the fcarcity may probably be a reafon 
for its not being in repute amongft good Fifhes, as fo 
few people ever eat it : The French Author gives it 
the following character. 

La Vive is one of the moft excellent of Sea Fifhes, 
(giving it the feminine Gender) fhe has iharp Points 
at the Ears, and on the Back, which prove venomous 
to fuch as arc pricked by them ; whenever this hap- 
pens, take out the Liver, and bruife it, to apply to 
the Wound ; or Salt and Onions mixed together ; or 
apply Spirits of Wine, as another Remedy. 

I lhall pafs over any particular Directions about 
this Fifh, for the fame reafon as I have obfcrved be- 
fore ; only giving the Names, by which the French 
diflinguifh the different ways of dreffing it, which may 
be referred to former Directions.

De -la Rale. 

Of Scate. 

*"pHE French reckon the Thornback Scate the bell ; 
they have the fmooth, which they call Turbole^ from 
its likenefs to the Turbot; and la Rale Ange, which I 
take to be what are called Maids in England. Obferv- 
ing that Scate moflly eats tough when dreffed very 
frefh, the Author fays, that in Sea-ports where it is to 
be had quite frelh, they put a piece of broken Glafs 
Bottle into the Water with the Frfli to boil, which makes 
it eat tenderer : Be this as it may, it is certainly an eafy 
Experiment. 

Rale a dljferentes Sauces. 
Scate to different Sauces. 

p*ACH different fort is prepared in the fame manner. 
Gut and wafh it well, boil it in Water, with a little 
Vinegar, Slices of Onions, and fweet Herbs ; when it 
is half done, put in the Liver to boil alfo : When done, 
ferve the Fifh and the Liver upon it, with the following 
Sauces, viz. Capers, Anchovy, Ravigotte, or Sauce 
Achee. 

N. B. Nothwithftanding this Direftion of boiling the Liver with 
the other Part of the Filh, it is better to boil all Fifli Livers apart, 
as they certainly fpoil the Whitenefs of the Fi(h if boiled together. 

Rale an Ecurre noir. 
Scate with burnt Butter. 

I3OIL it as the preceding, feafoning it with Pepper 
and Salt ; fry fome Butter, until it is quite black,

the Fifh : 

Rale a la Burgogne is done after the fame manner, only 
ufing red Wine inftead of white, and the Fifh being 
plain boiled. 

N. B. I have patted over feveral Kinds of Fifties, which are not 
found upon the Englifh Coaft ; for it is in Fifh as in Fowls, every 
Country having fome particular forts which others want. Neverthe- 
Jefs I am afraid that many People will blame my prolixity in giving 
fo many different Directions under this Head, as few other Methods 
are adopted in England, befides boiling, frying, and broiling, and 
thefe all ferved with much the fame Sauces. Yet it muft be remem- 
bered that this Book was compiled upon the Principles of Cooking in 
Paris, where they have not Sea Fifh fo frefh, and are obliged to 
drefs it in many different Ways, on account of the multiplicity of their 
Faft-Days, when no Meat is ufed, and a Number of Difhes are re- 
quired. My greateft Motive, for tranflating fo many of thefe Re- 
ceipts, was rather to give Information than Improvement ; however, 
they are not all void of Merit ; and I believe, there are few Books 
containing fuch a Number of Receipts of every Kind that are not 
more abundant in Superfluities,

keeping it from one day to another, or ufing the hot 
Water. Indeed they will be lighter according to the firft 
direction, but if the dough is well raifed, and not too 
: hard, they may be made very good in an hour's time.

pafte in the form of fliort thick Saufagcs, and cut 
fome of the Pafte length-ways ; roll it in the form of 
n fmall rope to twift round it according to fancy, and 
finifli it as the former. Thefe differences are proper upon 
a large Table, where two Dimes of the fame prepara- 
tion are ferved ; and mow the ingenuity of the 
workman. 

Petlts Pates a la Reine. 
Queen Patties, from the Sauce fo called. 

T JSE the fort of Pafte as for the two former, and rub the 
Moulds with Butter before you put the Pafte therein; 
bake them in a pretty quick Oven to make the Pafte rife 
the better : if you fear their taking too much Colour, 
put a Sheet of Paper over. Take minced Breafts of roaft- 
ed Chickens, Fowls or Turkey, Hare, Partridges, or 
any thing elfe, and make them reliming with Cream 
or Cullis, accordingly as you would have them white or 
brown, and pour it in the Patties when you are juft ready 
to ferve. When the Farce is prepared with Cullis, it is 
commonly baked in the Cruft, and the Cullis poured in 
after they are baked. This laft is called Petlts Pales an 
Jus, viz. Gravy or Cullis : both are the eflence of Meat. 
Pet'its Pates d la Becbamel are much the fame as d la Reine; 
they are called after the name of the Sauces, which only 
differ in fome very trifling alterations. See Sauce d /rf

ing ; put this into the bottom of the Patties, with fat 
Livers, and fliced Truffles upon it', a little fcraped 
Lard, and then the fame Farce over all ; bake thefe forts 
of Patties a pretty good while : When done, make a 

little hole at the top, to pour in a Sauce au Pontife* 

You make make Petits Pates drejfe, viz. Raifed Cruft, 
with any forts of Meat, either minced or cut into thin 
flices ; ; it is the Sauce you add to it that gives the 
Name, In regard to Mufhrooms, Truffles, Morels, 
. Afparagus, or any kind of Greens, you may make Patties 
of them alfo ; but thefe are called by the Subftance, and 
not the Sauce you add thereto ; for it is moflly either 
with Cream or Cullis, with proper Seafoning, according 
as the quality of the thing ufed may require. 

I lhall give no further directions, but only add the 
names by which Patties are ferved ; hoping the former 
explanation fufficient, without crowding more repeti- 
tions; but as people unacquainted with the names, 
are anxious to know whether any thing particular is 
meant, more than has been given already ; and to make 
all familiar with Bills of Fare, (as great merit is often put 
upon their not being underftood) they are as follows.

and may be ferved for Second-vourfe Difhes in its 
natural colour, or for a Defert, if painted. Thefe 
fmall Difhes, although of no confequence of them-

ufed. Chibol, or Chive, may be called a diminutive 
of Shallots, whether green or dried, the flavour being 
much lefs. And Rocambole is much the fame as 
Chibol : It is moftly ufcd green, either in Sallad, or 
made Dimes, the green tops being cut as Parfley or 
Garden-crefles, which fpring out again ; and its affi- 
nity to the two laft-mentioned has been my only rea- 
fon for not taking notice of it in every Receipt where 
it is dirc.dted as part of the compofition : I am uncerr 
tain whether this may be the reafon why it is not more 
cultivated in England. Parfley, for its great and ge- 
neral ufe, is known to the meaneft capacity ; it ought 
to be ufed frefli gathered, as it is apt to foment in

Of Truffles. 

French Author fays, that they are brought to 
Paris from the hot Provinces, particularly from 
Perigord, G-afcogne, Limofin, Agcnois, and other parts of 
the South of France. It is well known to all travel- 
lers, and many others, that the flavour of foreign 
Truffles is f:,r fuperior to thofe found in England ; 
which may be attributed to the coldnefs of the cli- 
mate. I believe Hampfhire produces the moft; tho* 
they are found in Windfor-park, and feveral other 
counties of England. They are imported from abroad, 
and fold at a very high price in moft Italian fhops ; 
but their flavour is much wafted, and very little fupe- 
rior to thofe found in England. They grow in the 
ground without any outward appearance. The Author 
fays, that, as Pigs are very fond of them, and have 
often been the occafion of difcovering where they 
grow, the hint might be ufefui in England, were a 
little more attention paid to it.

"VJORELS are much of the fame nature as Mufh- 
rooms ; they grow in fhady places, and are only 
to be had in the fpring : They require a deal of at- 
tention to clean them properly, being very fandy. 
By the Defcription the Author gives of Mwfferons and 
Champignons, it feems, that one nation or the other is 
miflaken in the appellation ; as I. apprehend, that 
Mufhrooms is literally tranflated from Moufferons. He 
fays, that Moujftrons are found in fhady mofly places, 
that they are fmaller than the Champignons, reddifh 
on the outfide, and white underneath : He calls them 
alfo a fpecies of Champignons,, of an excellent flavour 
and taftc. I have already taken notice of their ufes. 
The beft Champignons are thofe that grow on hot 
beds ; they ought to be very white and firm, and ufed

and to add to their merit, may be obtained almoft all

*TP H E names or appellations by which the different 
degrees of refining Sugar are diflmguiflied, fecm 
(as far as I am able to judge) to have no other mean- 
ing than their being adopted by cuftom in the French 
language. As I am unable to tranflatc them literally 
to their true fenfe and proper meaning, and being very 
willing to explain them to the utmoft of my power, 
(as it is a very neceffary part of knowledge, to iuch 
as are employed in the preparation of Sweet-meats) I 
ihall Hill retain the French appellations, with an ex- 
planation of their meaning, and diftinguifh each by 
f-rjlj fecond, ffr. &c. degrees of refining. The different 
terms ufed in the French language will foon become 
familiar, as well as many others in Cookery already 
enumerated. I am unacquainted with the terms ufed 
by Englilh Confectioners, as they are in every nation 
very fecret in regard to the preparations of Sugar. 
The reafon is very natural. To avoid any reflection 
of ungenerofity, I have not applied to any body in 
the courfe of the whole tranflation ; but ihall continue 
in my firft and firm refolution, to finifh it according to 
the Original, with fuch explanations as my fmall capa- 
city enables ine to give.

ing, &c. &c. In this cafe I Ihall ufe the word refining 
after the firft, which is clarifying. We have different 
ways of refining Sugar after it is clarified, each appro- 
priated to different purpofes, according to what ufe it

is intended ; they follow according to their degrees of 
reHning, and are diftinguifhed by the following names : 
The firft is called, petit Life ; fecond, grand Lffi; 
third and fourth, Le petit & grand Perle ; fifth and 
fixth, La petit & grande ^ueue^de Cochon ; feventh Le 
joufflei eighth and ninth, La petite & grande Plume-, 
tenth and eleventh, 'Le petit &f grot Boulet ; twelfth, Le 
Caffe; thirteenth, Le Caramel. It is to be oblerved, 
that thefe are prepared with fine Sugar. 

De la Fapn de clarifier le Sucre. 
The Method of clarifying Sugar. 

PROPORTION for three pounds of Sugar ; put a 
pint of Water and half the White of an Egg in a 
Skillet, beat it up with a Whilk to froth the White of 
the Egg, put it upon the Fire with the Sugar, make 
it boil, and as it riles put a little Water to it, and fo 
continue till the fcum begins to turn blackifh ; then 
take it off the Fire and let it fettle ; as the fcum rifes 
of itfelf, take it off with .a Skimmer, and put the 
Kettle on the Fire again ; continue to boil it, as it 
rifes throw in a little Water as before, and fkim it 
continually, till it ceafes to rife : When it is done, to 
clear it properly, fift it in a wet Napkin. Regulate 
the quantity of Water and Egg by this rule, for more 
or lefs. 

Premiere Cuiffon de Sucre, qin eft le Petit Liffe. 

Firft Degree of refining Sugar, called Small Lijfe, 
viz. flecked. 

pUT the clarified Sugar upon the Fire to boil gently; 
you will know when it is to this firft degree, by dip- 
ping one finger in it, joining it to the thumb, and 
then opening them ; for if it draws to a fmall thread, 
and in breaking returns to each finger in the nature 
of a drop, it is done. 

Mm Le 



530 7& PROFESSED COOK. 

Le grand Lijfe : Second Degree. It is boiled a little 
more, and the thread extends further before it breaks, 
and is proved after the fame manner. 

La petit Perle : Third Degree. It is ftill boiled a 
little more, until it does not break by extending the 
fingers half as much as is poffible to do. One pound 
of Sugar is fufficient to make a Trial of- all the dif- 
ferent Degrees. 

Cuijjbns 'au grand Perle, a la petite, & la grande Queue de 
Cochon, au fouffic, & a la petite Plume. 

Third, fourth, fifth, fixth, feventh, and eighth De- 
grees of refining. Perle, from Pearl, large and 
fmall; fmall and large Pigs Tails; puffed or blown; 
and Plume, or Feather. 

H E Grand Perle is boiled a little longer than the 
fmall, and is known to be to the Degree wanted, 
by not breaking by all the eytenfion that can be made 
with the fingers ; and alfo when it forms into fmall 
pearls in the boiling, round and railed, by which I 
prefume it takes its name. In boiling this laft a little 
longer, it comes to the fifth Degree, or' Petit )uette de 
Cocbon : It is known by taking up fome of the Sugar 
with a Skimmer, a-nd dropping it into the boiling 
Sugar again* : If it forms a flanting (break on the fur- 
face, this is called the little Pig's Tail The fixth 

Degree is La grande Queue de Cocbon ; which being ilill 
more boiled, and tried in the fame manner as the laft, 
forms a larger Pig's Tail. After a little more boiling 
comes the feventh Degree, Au fouffle, Blown ; which 
is known by dipping a Skimmer into it, giving it a 
fhake, and blowing through it directly ; if it blows to 
fmall fparks of Sugar, or in fmall bladders, it is to 
the propofed qualification. The eighth comes with a 
little more boiling, La petite Plume, fmall Feathers ; 
which is known by the fame trial ; the difference only 

is* 



The P R o F E s s E D COOK, 531 

is, that the fparks or bladders are to be larger, and of 
a ftronger fub fiance. 

Le grande Plume* 

A large Feather. Ninth Degree. 
J V is known by the former method, being ftill more 
'^ boiled, and the proof ftronger ; but the fureft is by 
dipping a Skimmer into it, and giving it a flrong turn- 
over (hake of the hand ; if it turns to large fparks, 
which clog together in the rifing, it is done to this 
Degree. 

Le petit Boukt. 

A fmall Ball or Bullet. Tenth Degree. 
J T is done by a little more boiling, and proved by 
dipping two ringers in cold Water, and directly into 
the Sugar, and into cold Water again ; what flicks to 
your fingers, ought to roll up like a bit of Paile, 
hard enough to form into fmall bullets, and to remain 
pretty fupple when cold. 

Eleventh Degree, Le gros Eoulet, large Bullet. This 
is proved by the laft method, which, by a little more 
boiling makes the Bullet harder when cold, as it ought 
to be. 

Twelfth Degree, Le CaJJe, Broken. By continuing 

to boil the Sugar, it is known by the fame method as 

in the two laft ; the only difference is, that the Bullet 

which is made of this, ought to crumble between the 

I fingers, being firft dipped in cold Water. 

Le Caramel. 

Burnt Sugar. Thirteenth Degree. 

'"p H I S refining is little different from the laft ; to 

make it pretty clear, fqueeze fome Lemon into it 

while it is boiling. There is alfo a deep-coloured^ Ca- 

: ramel, of which the ufes fliall be mentioned ; it is 

made with only a little Water with the Suguf, boiling

it without ftirring to raife any fcum, until it is to the 
colour required ; take it off the Fire for prefent ufe.-. 
To all the different degrees of preparation, if mifled 
at firft, add a little Water to refrelh the Sugar, and 
boil it over again, until it comes to the qualification 
required. 

De Pates de toutes Sorfes de Fruits. 
Pafte of all Sorts of Fruits. 

Pate de Cerices. 
Cherry Pafte. 

CTONE two pounds of fine ripe Cherries, boil them 
ibme time, and fift them through a Sieve with ex- 
preflion; put all the lifted fubftance into a Skillet, place 
it upon the Fire fome time to bring it to a drier con- 
fiftence, and mix a pound of Sugar with it, prepared 
to the ninth Degree, or grande Plume, ftirring it con- 
tinually with a wooden Spatula, viz. a flat Spoon. 
The Pafte ought to be of a fine red colour, pretty 
fubftantial, and applied directly to what ufe you pro- 
pofe. This is moftly done in moulds of different 
fizes and lhapes, made like hoops, without tops or 
bottoms ; put them upon a Baking-plate to dry a 
VEtui'ee, viz. an artificial Stove, or Hot-houfe, in 
which place all Sugar-pafte and Sweet-meats ought to 
be kept. Where there are no artificial Stoves (which 
are rather fcarce in England), thofe Paftes may be 
dried in a very mild Oven, or in any moderate heat, 
and always kept in a very dry place. 

Pate de Grofeilles. 
Pafte of Goofberries and Currants. 

QOOSBERRY Pafte is made much after the fame 

manner : Upon two pounds of Fruit put about a 

glafs of Water ; boil them a little while, and fift them 



The PROFESSED COOK. 533 

as the Cherries ; put it upon the Fire again, to reduce 
the Juice to a foft Paite confiftence, ftirring conti- 
nually : When it is come to a pretty thick fubflance, 
add a pound of Sugar, prepared as die laft, and finifh 
it in the lame manner. It is alfo done as follows, viz. 
when the Goofberries are fifted, to about three half- 
pints of Juice, put a pound of Sugar-powder, and 
boil together until it throws large Sugar-fparks, in 
blowing through a Skimmer dipt in the Boiling ; then 
take it off the Fire to mould it, and garnilh as the firfl.

fifted and boiled till the Water is quite fleck and 
frnooth to the fingers ; put the Almonds or Apricots 
in it, and let them ibak till the Down comes offeafily; 
ftir the Afhes pretty often to hinder them from fettling at 
bottom ; take the Pot off the Fire, to clean the Fruit 
one after another, and throw them in frefh Water as 
you clean them ; then boil them in frefh Water, ten- 
der enough to fift as ufual, and boil the Juice till it 
comes to a good confiftence, ftirring continually, for 
fear it fhould burn ; weigh the quantity, and add as 
much Sugar au Cafe; (twelfth Degree) mix it very 
well together off the Fire, ufe it in moulds diredly, 
and dry it as ufual.

them pretty dry on the ire, and maih them very 
fine ; add a pound of Sugar prepared a lagrande Plume, 
(ninth Degree) flir them well together on the Fire, 
till the Pafle quits the Spoon ; finifli it directly in the 
moulds, and dry it rather hotter than the former Pafle. 
- It is done alfo, by adding an equal weight of raw 
Powder-fugar, when the Fruit is foaked fome time 
pretty dry, and flirring continually, till it is come to 
a gopd confidence on the Fire ; finifli as the lafl. 

Pdte de Pecbes. 
Peach Pafle. 

pEEL and flone the Peaches, and cut them into dice; 
refine half as much Sugar in weight as Peaches, to 
the ninth Degree ; then boil both together to bring 
them to a Pafle, and put it in moulds directly to dry 
in the Stove. 

Pate de Prunes : Of Plumbs. Boil them with a lit- 
tle Water to a Marmalade, and fift them in a Sieve j 
put the Juice upon the Fire again to dry it to a Pafle, 
taking care to flir it continually ; add as much Sugar,

laft, only that it is well bruifed in the Pan before 
it is put to boil, fifted, and reduced as ufual ; mix 
with it as much weight of Sugar, prepared as the laft, 
and finifhed in the fame manner. This is often doney 
by mixing about half the quantity of Apples with the 
Grapes, being peeled, cut into pieces, and reduced tQ 
a Marmalade ; fift as ufual, and dry to a Pafte con- 
fiftence ; then add as much weight of Sugar, a la

Compote of roafled or broiled Peaches. 

'T'HIS is made differently. Such as are not quite ripe 
may be roafted before the Fire like Apples, and 
ferved with powdered Sugar over them, or a light Syrup 
under : Others are fried over a fmart Fire, till the 
Rind can be rubbed off by walhing in Water ; they 
are then boiled whole in Sugar and Water. They may 
be boiled in Water till the Rind can be torn off; drain 
them, prepare fome Sugar au Caramel, and roll the 
Peaches in it gently until they are done ; put them, 
into the Compotier ; add a little Water in the Pan to 
gather the remaining Sugar, and pour it upon the 
Peaches. This is moftly done with latter Fruit.

De Verjtts &? Mufcat. 

Compote of Verjuice and Mufcacline Grapes. 
HIS is done when the Grapes are almoft ripe ; grain 
them, and put them in Water ready to boil ; take 
ithemoff as foon as they change colour, and add a little 
cold Water to refrefti them ; let them cool in this Wa- 
iter, and it will bring them to their firft natural green ; 
jto a pound of Grapes, boil half a pound of Sugar with 
la little Water ; when the Sugar is properly melted, put 
!the drained Raifms therein, and boil them together a 
(moment ; take them off the Fire, and fkum them with 
bits of paper ; put the Verjuice in the Compotier, and 
[reduce the Syrup to what confidence you think proper 
ito pour upon the Grapes. When the Grapes are out 
jof lealbn, boil fonic of the preferved Liquid ; warm 
jit in fomc of the Syrup, and a little Water, and fervc 
Jin the fame manner. Mufcadinc is made after the 
jfame manner ; after boiling a little time, and draining, 
jboil them a moment in Sugar, prepared au petite Plume, 
((eighth degree) half a pound of Sugar to a pound 
jof Fruit. 

Compote de Prunes. 
Compote of Plumbs. 

"THERE are but few forts of Plumbs in England that 
will bear boiling. Green Gages are in the firft 
perfection for this purpofe, though neither they, nor 
any others muft be thoroughly ripe for it ; alfo the 
Mirabel Plumb, and a few others, moftly of foreign ap- 
pellation : Boil them a little while in raw Sugar and a 
fittle Water, according to their ripenefs ; fkim it when 
cooling with bits of paper, and reduce the Syrup ac- 
:ording as you propofe to keep them ; if for prefent 
pfe, it is fufficient to make a good palatable Syrup : 
[Serve hot or cold. The beft method for preferving is 
:o j>rick them in feveral places, and fcald them in boil- 
i ng Water until they rife on the furface ; take them off

the Pan, and put them on a flow Fire, which will bring 
them back to their proper colour ; then drain them 
into cold Water, and boil them a Moment in Sugar au 
petit LiffeJ (firil degree;) leave them in the Sugar till 
the next day, and boil them a little more : When pre- 
pared after this manner, they will keep a long while. 
Such forts of Plumbs as will not bear boiling without 
breaking to a Marmalade, are only to be prepared for 
prefent ufe, and are foon done ; fcald them a moment 
in boiling Water ; then boil them in Sugar and a little 
Water, and fkim them in the fame manner.

of a Knife, to hinder them from cracking and flying 
out; broil them in Aflies, take off the'Hufks, fimmer 
them fome time in clarified Sugar, and add a Seville 
Orange-fqueeze ; when taken off the Fire, fqueeze 
them a little before boiling in the Sugar, by which 
means they will take the Sugar the better : Do them 
gently, for fear they ihould crumble, and let them be 
in the Syrup a day or two, or more, before ufing. 

Compote d'Oranges douces. 
Compote of fweet or China Oranges. 

'T'HEY are ferved as Compotes without any other

You may alfo ferve them whole, peeled or not ; prick 
them with a Knife in feveral places,, and fluff as much 
Sugar in every one as they will admit ; the Lemon is 
ferved after the fame manner, uling Sugar in propor- 
tion to its fharpnefs.

clarify the fame weight of Sugar as Fruit. Both forts 
of Oranges and Lemons are done after this manner, 
either whole, in halves, or quarters. Obferve to foak 
them a long while in feveral Waters before bpiling, 
which draws the bitternefs out of the Rinds, and makes 
them much more tender. 

Compote de Cerifes. 
Compote of Cherries.

are called by the fame name, only diftinguifhing the 
colour, viz. red, and may be done without being 
grained, (that is, in bunches) boiled, and ferved in 
the fame manner ; indeed they require rather more 
Sugar, and are never ufed for this purpoie until they 
are ripe. 

Compote de Groje'ilks vertex*

mon-juice, Whites of Eggs, and Powder-fugar, and 
drop the compofition on Paper, in the bignefs of Al- 
monds ; dry in the Stove, or a mild Oven. 

Another falhion of preparing fham Almonds, is, 
when fcaldcd, to cut them into limall Fillets ; and mix 
them with rafped Lemon-peel, Whites of Eggs, : nd 
Sugar, fufficieiit to make a pretty firm Pafte ; roll it 
in the mape of Almonds, and finifh either as the firft

while, till the Sugar is again to the fame degree, and 
take care to fkim it ; fift it through a Sieve, and put 
it into Pots or Glafles. 

N. B. It is to be obferved, that as thefe Jellies are directed to be 
done much in the fame nature as the Marmalades, that the difference 
muft be obferved in fifting the different forts of Fruits, not to force 
the grofs flemy particles, rather only the Juices, which make the Jel- 
lies clearer, and ought for that purpofe to be ftrained in Linen Cloths, 
rather than any kind of Sieves.

about three weeks, then add three quarters of a pound 
of clarified Sugar to each quart of Brandy ; let it in- 
fufe about a fortnight longer, then ftrain as direcled

Du CaffL 
Of Coffee. 



*1pHE beft is that which comes from Turkey, and is 
A known by its fuperior good flavour -, it is light, 
and the Beans are of a middling bignefs, the colour 
tending much to grey, and ought to be roafted frefli 
for ufe : The French moftly roaft it in flat earther 
Pans, (lining continually till it is of a fine brojim 
and hip-h flavour ; then fmothered in Paper or a Li- 
nen Cloth : When roafted, in particular it ought to 
be kept in a warm place. When you ufe it, boil tl 
Water firft, and according to the quantity of 
wanted, put for each a Table-fpoonful of ground 



608 The PROFESSED COOK. 

Coffee or more; and as it rifes in boiling, pour a little 
Water upon it : Many people do not clear it off to 
ferve, and by that means it preferves its flavour the 
better. To make it clear, have a pair of red-hot 
tongs, and burn a bit of Sugar into the Pot, which 
will clear and fettle it directly : If you would have it 
with Cream or Milk, you muft make it much ftronger 
than with Water, and it mould be drained through a 
cloth. Coffee is alfo made by putting it into the Pot 
without Water, and on the Fire a moment, till it 
throws a great fmoke , then the Water is poured upon 
it, and boiled a moment. Cafe au Lait, viz. with 
Milk, is very famionable in France* 

Du Chocolat. 
Of Chocolate. 

DIMMER the Chocolate on a flow Fire, in the prcn 
portion of two ounces to each Cup : ftir it about a 
good deal with a Chocolate-mill, and when it is pro- 
perly diflblved and thickened, add a Yolk of ah Egg, 
beat up, to the proportion of four Cups, or the Whites 
equally beat up, and the firft froth thrown away ; mix: 
it firft with a little of the Chocolate, which add to the 
reft, and mill it very well to incorporate together : 
This will make it of a proper confifteneej and of a 
better froth. It is beft to be made a day or two be- 
fore ufing. If you keep it ready-made any time, boil 
it a moment every other day; fweeten it according 
to tafte. 



N. B. The French Author fays, Diflblve and boil one 
viz. a Cake or Lozenge, to each Cap. It is to be obferved, that 
their Chocolate is made into fmall Cakes, which contain about twelve 
to a pound, and is fweetened in the making, which is commonly 
called Dutch Chocolate in England.
