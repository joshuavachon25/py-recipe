HOUSEKEEPING. 



\ 



Word of grace to woman; word thai makes her th«a 
earthly providence of hor family, that wins gratitude and 
attachment from those at home, and a good report of 
those that are without. Success in housekeeping adds 
credit ^o the woman of intellect, and lustre to a woman's 
accomplishments. It is a knowledge which it is as dis- 
creditable for any woman to be without as for man not 
to know how to make a living, or how to defend himself 
when attacked. He may be ever so good an artist, ever 
so polished a gentleman ; if deficient in these points of 
self-preservation you set him down for a weakling, and 
his real weight in society goes for very little. So, no 
matter how talented a woman may be, or how useful in 
the church or society, if she is an indifferent house- 
keeper it is fatal to her influence a foil to her briUiancy 
and a blemish in her garments

Housekeeping ought- not to be taught in classes and by 
professors ; though when early training is lacking they 
may be of use. It is one of those things to be imbibed 
without effort in girlhood, instead of being taken up at 
marriage and experimented on with varying certainty for 
the rest of one's natural life. There is no earthly reason 
why girls, from eight to eighteen, should not learn and 
practise the whole round of housekeeping, from the first 
beating of eggs to laying carpete and presiding at a din- 
ner party, at the same time that they go on with music, 
languages and philosophy. The lessons would be all the 
better learned if, instead of sitting down at once out of 
school hours, the girl was taught to take pride in keeping 
her room nice, or in helping about such work as canning 
fruit for the season, hanging clean curtains, or dusting 
every day. The wealthiest women of the oldest families 
in society are not above seeing to these things themselves, 
and they know how it should be done. They were bred 
to it as part of a lady's duty. But if a woman finds her- 
self ignorant or half-taught how to keep house,^here is 
nothing so difficult to learn that she may not be proficient in 
in a year or two at most. An intelligent woman will suc- 
ceed in most duties at first trying. Housekeeping is ah 
exact science, and works like the multiplication table if 
one only has learned it. But if one is shaky in figures 
how is he ever to keep accounts ? There is no chance 
about housekeeping. If Mrs. Smith's sitting room is 
always neat and fresh, it is because she sweeps it with tea 
leaves, and sponges the carpet with ox gall, and dusts it 
with a damp cloth, and keeps a door mat on the porch, 
ftud sends the boys back every time to use it till they get Um

habit of keeping clean. While you hang a newspaper 
before the what-not and throw one over the work table, 
sweep with a soft broom, putting the broad side of it at 
every stroke against the moulding ; instead of carrying 
all the dust clean from the crevice next the wall, by one 
lengthwise sweep with the corner of the broom, you 
blow the dust off some places and give a hasty rub at 
others; pass the stove with a touch from the hea.rth 
brush instead of blacking it, and let the boys track in 
mud and dust enough to deface a new carpet in its first 
»!eason while you take it out in scolding — which was 
never known to brighten rooms yet. So, when your 
feather cake fails, though you made it precisely by the 
rule which the other day came out like bleached sponge, 
there is a very good reason for it, you did not stir it as 
much as the first time, or you beat it a little too long and 
lost the best effervescence of your soda, or your baking 
powder had been left open a few minutes at a time on 
baking days and lost strength. By practising the same 
recipe cSefully, all these and other pointe fix themselves 
in your mind, so that success is certain. Those clever 
cooks, whose success is so much a matter of instinct, 
observe all these points unconsciously each time, and 
lay it to luck ? There's no such word in housekeeping. 
This labour does not only mean keeping things clean, 
and having plenty to eat. It goes from the outside of 
the house to the inside of the travelling-bags of those 
who leave it. The mistress must observe the outside of 
her house regularly ; on Saturday is the most convenient 
time to see if window-blinds need washing, if the catches 
ftre in repair, if the shades inside hang straight, and tb«

curtainB drape well, if the walk, steps, and piazzas ar« 
neat, and the door knobs and paint in order, making a 
note of every want, and having it attended to at oace. 
Dexterity with tools is very convenient to any one and I 
have known accomplished women who ^vould set a pane 
of glass, put on a door knob, and hang a ,'jate in the best 
style. One of the valued contributors to the New York 
press is a woman who reads Horace in Latin, and 
Bastiat's political economy, makes point-lace and ftm- 
broiders beautifully, who at the gold mines with 
husband built the chimney to her house, and fin^^n 
most of the interior with her own hands. A little care, 
weekly, "keeps a place in that bright order that so a^ v 
and welcomes one at sight It looks as if whole peop'* 
lived in it, with live sensibilities and intelligence. In- 
doors the same spirit is reflected. The bell-pull never is 
left for weeks after it gets loose, the gas burners ar: "ever 
suflfered to leak, or grow dim; the kerosene lamps are 
large enough to give good light, and of the best pat' rn 
for safety, and for the eye. The stoves are^'L.o -.^ 
"Fireside" kind — the modern version of the old Fraru,iin 
stoves — giving the ventilation and delight of an open fi-*^, 
burning either coal or wood, with bars and fender like a 
grate ; yet, capable of being shut up as tightly as any 
base-burning heater by two tight fitting covers 4,.*iat may 
be removed and put away at pleasure. The hbt»*..b,^thfl 
comfort, the luxury of such an addition makes up foi 
many a deficiency beside. The carpet was well-chosen 
at first in small figures and warm colours of good que' iy, 
whether Brussels or three-ply, and it looks well as g 
as it lastai. and kept clean by shaking twice a year

laid straight and stretched smooth over a soft liningi 
which saves the caipet and saves noise; danied at 
tli^ first break with wool matching the pattern, it will 
not be shabby in ten years. It is pleasant to have 
things last with the family, and grow to seem a part 
of it. The true sentiment of the sha^- genteel woman 
was exposed by the housekeeper who "liked to 
have hei* carpets wear out so she could have new 
on«^." She let lodging^ to have company, and money 
i^»<VireSc with ? against her husband's wish, and her otily 
^rt«K4 was that of " settling down and havin^i a lot of 
children with no theatres, ho opera, nobody) to see." 
'>'-3«'ii^me feeling, the attachment that grows for |||e 
pleasant, enduring objects of daily use is one of the 
rare plants of sentiment that the housekeeper does well 
tx) cheiish* There should be caie at first to have things 
agieeable and handsome as possible, that they need not 
be a daily eyesore, and there need be no reason for wish- 
iisrf5Tth6m to wear out. Manufactures constantly add 
6eQ;itetM^ trade by placing better })attems in reacli of 
ino(H»rate purses. Thus, the mottled carpets in oak and 
Wif'Wflj ash and crimson, maroon and elm-leaf yellow, 
wifch borders to match, so admii«ed in velvet and Brus- 
sels, are found in fine three-ply s and ingrain, and in the 
newe** ->4*netiaris of hemp and wool, like the old-fashion- 
m1 stai^lfiSrpet that lasts bo long. A word for tliese new 
Vieiietians, which is, on account of their artistic quality, 
I likely to be overlooked, because they are so cheap. All 
the best colours and patterns of Brussels, in two shades, 
I in mottled, moss' or leaf designs, are aftbrded in this 
prpet, which is as durable as the conscieiios of a house*

keeper could exact. Two rules are eoough foi the looks 
cf a carpet ; choose small figures and avoid contrasts of 
colour. Small figures, however, have diflferent mean- 
ings to ditferent people. As a rule, a small figure is not 
more than three inches at most, any way across. Very, 
very few rooms there are, but look better with caipeta 
of small design. Then the oil-cloth under the stove 
must match, if possible, and be bound with leather 
Birips to keep the edge from getting unsightly. The 
woodbox or basket is covered with wool work or canvas, 
or applique of bright cloth on Turkish towelling, making 
a handsome bit of furniture. A scrap basket, with ap- 
plique border, and a bright lining, goes far toward keep- 
ing a room tidy. The mistress will try to have her 
rooms in keeping with the style by a few pieces of furni- 
ture in the fashion of the day, a Turkish chair embroid- 
ered in wools, a straight-backed one in unbleached 
towelling and applique of crimson, blue, black and gold, 
a stand covered with velvet, or a home-made easel with 
the single good picture the house aflfords on it, a jar- 
diniere of titles or wickerwork in the window, or a 
bai-iboo lounge, things not expensive in themselves, yet 
lending a graceful air to quiet surroundings. As for 
chairs, sofas and lambrequins, artists have been insist- 
ing on chintz for the last ten years, and women have as 
steadily bought woollen rep, which the doctors tell ua 
harbours dust, absorbs vitiated matter from the air, and 
is absolutely dangerous in disease from the contagion it 
holds. But women of the best taste, who like to have 
ibeir rooms pretty, Mrill choose chi:itz, when they can- 
not afford silk and satin, and often when they can, foi 
lU intrinsio beftoly. 




HOUSEKESPINQ. 



10 



It is of more account to have broad seats a. id deep 
cushions to chairs and sofas, than to have them covered 
with rich material. See that there are plenty of low seats 
in your sitting-room — for much of the f urnitui'O seen is of 
very little use for rest and ease — points essential to the 
health and comfort of women and children. If a woman 
will only start with the intention of making her house 
comfortable, she will gain all the admiration she wants. 
There are many elegant rooms in private houses, whore 
there are only one or two that come up to the idea of com- 
fort. Now that is a very important word, one that cannot 
be infringed on without losing health. The mistress of a 
house must see that it is ventilated from top to bottom, 
by having every window and the skylight, if there is one, 
open at least once a day — if possible when the sun is shin- 
ing. She is responsible for the health of the household, 
and must allow no scent of decay, whether from vegetables 
or meat, barrels or refuse in the cellar, no slops anywhere 
about the premises, no mouldering food in closets, no con- 
fined bedrooms or closets with old clothes or soiled linen 
to tfl,iut the air, no dead, musty smell in any room, how- 
ever seldom used, no sickly smell escaping from rooms 
where there is illness. She must see that fires are started 
as early in the fall and kept as late in the spring as the 
weakest, chilliest of her family desires, for these slow 
chilly day!:3 take more life, and play more miscliief with 
nerves and blood than she could bear to think of, could she 
see their eftects. She must look after the clothin^rom a 
hygienic view, to see that her chudren and family are 
warm enough and cool enough, sO|pvarding off many an 
Attack of cramps, coughs and neuralgia. The food must

be of the best quality and she must know that it is. It 
pays to give an extra shilling on the half bai lel for select- 
ed potatoes and apples, as they go farther and make more 
muscle than poor ones, and don't poison anybody. Sharp 
scrutiny of eggs, meat, butter, and milk, is a benefit to 
others as well as her own iamily, by raising the standard 
of pi-ovisions, besides it is a direct gain. More disease 
comes into the world in Uie shape of tainted butter and 
milk, than any one dreams of but the doctors. If she gets 
the hygienic craze about food, don't let her carry it to the 
verge of confounding things " healthful " witli things un- 
eatable, for badly cooked oktmeal and graham "gems" 
are as distressing to delicate organisms as the richest 
mince pie and old cheese together. That slight sour tinge, 
which nobody noticed, in the home-made bre%d, that solid 
pudding, which jet was not quite rejected at dessert, are 
responsible for the bad breath of the children and the be- 
orinino: of a sick headache in their eldeiu Never be sat- 
isfied with any but the uiccf^ cooking, with variety 
enough to make your table a delight as well as a necessity. 
And don't let anybod}- lay it to you that you are pam- 
pering your family, and devoting yourself to a low 
sphere of action. You are doing no such thing, but are 
giving them strong, active bodies, steady nerves and tem-

as you can, but yon must seo that all is done as it shouW 
be. And one receipt for training service is given, that in 
the whole secret in a nut-sholi. If child or servant leaves 
anything undone, or ill-done, don't scold, but insist on 
having it done immediately as it onght to be. Put the 
badly ironed shirts in the basket to be done over, have 
the house-girl who left the china badly washed, take it 
out oP the closet and do it nght, time after time, and let 
her get tired of doing her work over, before 3'^ou get tired 
of telling hgr. It is no harder to do work nicely than 
to half do i6, indeed the careless way is the hardest. 
Finally, let your housekeeping bo as liberal as you can. 
Whether well-io-do, or in narrow circumstances, you will 
hold that waste is a sin, against yourself and the world. 
By keepin^trict account of every cent received and paid 
out, you can gauge your means, laying by what is proper, 
but within that limit be good to yourself and yours. 'Ma^ke 
the most of your money. It was no less a divine than 
the "orthodox Doctor John Hall, who said that, of the 
two faults, he had far rather see people extravagant 
than penurious. Stint nowhere in cleanliwe.ss, light, and 
warmth, and let what you h&ve be the best and prettiest 
for the cost. By these things men live, in body at least, 
and the soul is very dependent on its surroundings, or 
at any rate greatly assiste'^ by favourable ones. It is an 
every-day wonder to see how little rich people get for thei r 
money ; the common-place houses, with so little that is 
light or striking or original in them, the dull service, the 
narrow round of enjoympnts. In some sense housekeep-

into it, compassing difficult ends with invention. Those

men, not men for manners. N'ice customs, courtesy to 
great kings, and the greatest of these ie convenience. 
Most rules will be found to serve convenience, and there 
is no good breeding where etiquette is not observed for 
this end, the order and comfort of all concerned, no* for 
the sake of defining one's social position. When any 
one begins to study manners as a set of arbitrary rules to 
he followed, because every other desirable acquaintance 
does the same, politeness breeds a sort of pharisaism 
that the best bred persons look down on as supremely 
vulgar. If any mistress of a house looks here for rules, 
that will aid her to affect a trifle more of stylo than her 
neighbours, she will only be disappointed. If any 
woman wishes hints how to reduce her household to 
regularity, and make her children neat and gentle in 
habits, it may be that she will not find this chapter in

for dinner parties takee the sensible course of sittin}» 
down to taMe when the hour comes, and the principal 
part of those expected. No guest should feel affronted, 
if he is late, and finds the party at dinner, provided the 
indispensable care has been shown to keep his portion 
wiirm over dishes of hot water, by which they neither 
grow cold or are dried up in the oven. Order the table 
daily with the same care as for a dinner party. This 
is the onl}'' way to insure success for hostess and ser- 
vants, when one does come off, and gives mistress and 
waiter the luxury of getting used to nice style, so that 
it is just as easy as common ways, and no sudden vis- 
itor can put them out. Home tables do not always 
compare to advantage with those at the restaurant or 
club, and the hmisemother should see that a man finds 
as careful service at ho ne as he does anywhere else. 
Unlimited laundiy work should be one of the indul- 
gences of one's own house, and it should be of the ut- 
most nicety. Why should it be too much to provide 
clean napkins anu table-cloth daily at home as well as 
at a hotel ? They would cost half an hour's extra work 
a day, and this is not too much for the refinement it 
gives. We should then expect to see the table spread 
with a snowy cloth, less starched than many house- 
keepers think necessary, finish and pliancy given by 
plenty of wax in the starch, which will kec[> it clean the 
longer. It should fall below the table half a yard all 
round, and be pinned up at the corners to keep it froi» 
the floor if necessary. For ceremonious occasions, a 
common white cloth is laid \mder the table-cloth to 
protect a handsome table keeps the upper cloth froisi

For breakfap\ the coffee is set before the mistress, the 
cups and spoons ranged in their saucers in frcuit of it, in 
two rows if there are many of them ; the meat and 
plates, which should be warm, before the master ; salt, 
butter and castor at {.hfi corner to the right of both, 
head and foot, if the table is a large one, when two seta 
of these things will be convenient. Otherwise put them 
in the centre with the dishes in regular order around 
them, and relishes at the corners. To meet this order, 
it is a trifle to have dishes in pairs of the same size, and 
use them always together for different things. Fruit, 
whether • berries, baked apples, or pears, is served firjt 
at breakfast, then oatmeai or wheaten grits, now found 
on every good table in cities at least, then meats and 
vegt tables, with toast, hot cakes and coffee following. 
Hot rolls come wrapped in a napkia to keep them warm, 
griddle-cakes between two hot plates, and all meats 
covered. Baked potatoes t e scrubbed with a raanilla 
brush, the ends cut off, rinsed tv/ice, and eaten without 
paring, as the best flavour goes with the skin. This is 
the custom with the best society in this country and 
abroad. Eggs are washed with a cloth in cold water 
before boiling, and eaten in egg cups from the shell, 
chipping the small end off, or broken into larger glasses, 
or held in the napkin and eaten from the shell with 
entire good form, in either method. Where individual 
salt-cellars are used they should be enjptied pfter each 
meal, and the salt thrown away, that one person may 
tiot use it after another, and they should l;e very small,

that there be less wasted. Butter should be piled round 
a lump of ice in little pats. To be very nice, as many 
have learned to like it from living abroad, it should be 
churned daily from perfectly sweet cream, worked with- 
out being touched by the hands or with water, and with- 
out a particle of salt. Thus it has the delicate flavour 
of cream at its best. Honey is especially a breakfast

away with the disagreeable feeling that everybod^^ is too 
busy with drudgery to look after comfort Insist that 
the girl who waits on the table has her hair neat, her 
hands washed, and a clean apron and collar on. An 
unkempt servant will spoil the best dinner appetite was 
ever sharp-set for. Ceremonious lunches mean an 
hour's visit with a meal, at which salads, shell-fish, 
chops, in paper frills, and broiled chicken play a party 
with ices, tarts, and fan<'v rak-^s for dessert. Mixed

dnuics, like Regent's punch, or claret sup, with ale and 
beer, are more in keeping at lunch than wines. These 
drinks are served from the side-board, the malt liquors 
in common goblets, the claret sup in tumblers, the 
punch in small cups. Beef tea is taken from cups held 
in small saucers, or in small Chinese bowls, with little 
saucers. The absence of all ceremony with the presence 
of light charming detail makes the luncheon attractive. 
For dinner, the family table wants to have less the air 
of hotel arrangements. More delicate napery and ware 
whether the latter is only " seconds, " or the finest egg- 
shell china ; lighter, more covenient, knives and forks, 
and heavier teaspoons, nice thin glass for drinking, 
thick cut crystal for sweets, with, above all things, a well- 
kept cruet stand, make the difference in favor of home 
taste and home comfort. Keep all cracked, and nicked 
ware from the table. Buy nothing that cannot be 
replaced without regret, but let each article be the best 
of its material. There is choice in the quality of stone 
ware and blown glass as well as in the shapes of each. 
The plainest is always most satisfactory of inexpensive 
things. The old fashion of furnishing dining-rooms in 
dark and heavy styles is reversed. The room is light, 
cheerful, warm in colour, the chairs broad a^d substan- 
tial, the table lower than it used to be, two points which 
add sensibly to the comfort of those who use them. 
Have the chair feet shod with rubber tips which como 
for the purpose, or if on castors, cover the wheel with 
rubber so that they can moye without noise. See that 
the room is light and especially warm, for people want 
eomfort IbA meals of all times, and they feel the cold 
more in sittingf.

A 



DINNER ETIQUETTE. 



Directions for a ceremonious dinner naturally include 
those for the family table, as much form in serving 
being kept as may be convenient. The number of guests 
for a state dinner rarely exceeds twelve. 

Written invitations are always complimentary and in 
finer style than any other for small parties, but persona 
who entei-tain often, have engraved cards with blanks 
left for the name of guest, and date, for convenience. 
The following is a form adopted for dinner cards, a 
large, nearly square form being used : 

Mb. and Mrs. 



Keqneet the pleasure of 



.Company (name.) 
date uid Na 



..o'doA. 



The favour of an answer ia requested, 
(or) B. S. Y, P. 

For a gentleman's party the host's name alone 
appeai-s on the invitation. An early answer must be 
*3nt in all cases, either to accept or decline. Not to do 
■o ia the firrossest rudeness. 




DINNER ETIQUETTE. 



S5 



Invitations are always sent to pei-sons in the same 
town by private messenger. Outside envelopes are 
necessary only when sent by mail to another city. No 
particular excuse need be sent. It is enough to say " Mr 

and Mrs. regret that they aie unable to accept 

Mr. and Mrs. kind invitation for the date 

named." When the dinner is to meet any particular 
guest or distinguished person, it is made known by th« 
words, " To meet So-and-So," at the head of the invi- 
tation, or after the name of t-He invited person beforo 
the date. 

Written invitations are on note sheets of mill-finished 
paper with side fold, the fancy, rough, and the highly 
glazed papers of eccentric shapes and fold being out ol 
use. The large envelope, nearly square, allows tli6 
sheet to be doubled once to tit. Cards have the same 
tinish, neither dull nor highly polished. The cipher of 
initials entwined is preferred to the monogram, and 
occupies the corner of the note slieet. 

Guests arrive at any time during the lialf hour before 
dinner, and, after leaving wraps in the dressing-room, 
arc met by the host and hostess at the door of the drawing 
room. Introductions follow if the guest is a stranger. If 
the party is given in honour of any distinguished person, 
or favourite visitor, the other guests are brought uj) to 
him or her and presented. It is an omen of success ibr 
her evening if the hostess can make convei*»iation geneial 
before dinner. To this end, have some novelty at hand, 
either in the shape of a personage whom eveiybody wants 
to meet, or a new picture, a grotesque group, a rare plant 
in the diawing-room, the latest piece of news to teU. or

a pretty girl to ^ring foi^yard. Whatever the attraction 
bring it on at once, to prevent that very stupid half-hour. 
A« the hour, the servant comes in and tells the hostesa 
dinner is served. The arranging of the guests has all 
been considered beforehand. If she wishes people to 
think her dinner a pleasant one, the hostess will see that 
the likings of her guests are consulted ^n pairing off for 
the table. Host and hostess intimate t« * the gentlemen 
whom they are to escoi-t. " Mr. Lance, svill you be kind 
enouj/h to take Miss Dart in to dinner. Mr. Curtis, be 
so good as to see Mrs. Vane. Jermingham, I know you'd 
prefer Miss Olney, she's such a good listener. Mr. King, 
if you want to finish telling that story to Mrs. Capron, 
suppose you give her your arm, " and so on. If the guest 
fflp|||honoured is a lady, the host offers her his arm and 
go6s out first, the hostess last. If a gentleman, he escorts 
the hostess, apd the host follows the company. Before 
dinner is announced, after the guests have arrived, the 
host has the names of each person written on a card and 
laid on the plates at the place where he or she is to sit. 
This does away with that awkward moment when the 
guests are in the dinning room waiting to be told their 1^ 
places. The method long used at public dinners is now 
adopted for private ones in the best circles. 

The standard size for dinner tables is four and-a-haH 
feet wide, by any length desired. Round tables for gen- 
tlemen's dinners, where all are wanted in the conversa- 
tion are made seven feet across. Dining chairs should 
have cushioned seats covered with fine leather, but no 
arms, or very low ones, that will not impede the flow of 
tadiip' dresses. People who make a study of entertaia

ing are particular on such points, ^ch gentleman 
offers his right arm to the lady he cakes to dinner and 
aeats her on his left, which gives occasion for a pretty 
piece of attention on his part. On reaching their places, 
he draws out her chair for her, and as her hand leaves 
his arm he takes the tips of Iver fingers and hands her 
to her seat, relinquishing his touch with a slight l)Ow or 
glance of acknowledgment. Of course, the honoured 
guest, if a lady, takes the right hand of the host ; if a 
gentleman, he is at the ri^ it of the hostess. 

Small can-shaped pitchei*b of engraved crystal, holding 
about a quart, ai'e placed with ice water betwetjn each pair 
of guests. The napkins are folded tiat, with a thick piece 
of bread on each, a cruet-stand and silver salt cellar is at ^ 
each corner, and a silver butter dish at each end. The . 
stnall individual salt cellars and butter plates, have an 
air of hotel arrangements which it is desirable to avoid at 
home dinners, though entirely admissable and convenient* 
at breakfast. If wax lights are used, there should be as 
many candles as guests, according to the old rule. These 
are in branches held by Sevres and Dresden figures, 
above the heads of the guests. Nor are wax lights by any * 
means the extravagance they seem. Dinner napkina 
are from three-quarters to seven-eighths of a yard square, 
and should match the cloth, for >yhich Greeks Moresque, 
und Celtic filigrees and diaper ps.tterns are preferred to 
large arabesques and fruit pieces. French .napkins of 
fine fringed damask, with crimson figures of lobster and 
ciawfish woven in the centre, are sometimes used at firstt 
and removed with the fish. DecoTi.tions must be choice, 
and used with discretion. FIowwb should be fine "but

few, for cultivatfcd senses find their odor does not mingle 
pleasantly with that of food. All artificial contrivances, 
like epcTgnes and show-pieces, tin gutters lined with 
moss and filled with flowers for the edges of a table, or 
mirror plates to reflect baskets of blossoms, are banished 
by the latest and best taste. The finest fruit gi.ouped in 
the centre of the table, set oft' with leaves, the garnished 
dishes, the lustre of glass and silver, and the colours of 
delicately painted china, need no iiuproveinent as a 
picture. A low silver basket of flowers at the sides, and 
a crystid bouquet holder with a delicate blossom and 
leaf, spaiingly introduced, arc all that is allowed for 
ornament's sake. Large dinner services of one pattern 
are no longer chosen. The meats and large dishes are 
in silver or electroplate ware, the sweets come in heavy 
English cut crystal, and each course brings with it plates 
of a different ware. 

The ordej^ef^ wines is sometimes perplexing, and the 
novice should remember that Chablis or Sauterne comes 
with the small oysters before soup, and that Sherry is 
drank after soup. Claret may be taken by those who 
prefer it during a whole dinner with entire propriety. 
Champagne comes with the roast, and Burgundy with 
game. The French and Germans resei-ve champagne 
for a dessert wine, but we drink it with both roast and 
dessert. After dessert comes coti'ee, ivhich should be 
Berved, however, in the drawing-room. Fingerbowla 
with warm water are placed on the napkin on the dessert 
plate, and removed by the guest to the left, to be used

Doiljr. When the ladies are quite through with dessert

the hostess catches the eye of each or raises her gloved 
hand slightly, as a signal, and they leave the table, the 
oldest lady going first, the youngest last, followed by the 
hostess — the youngest gentleman, or the one nearest the 
door, taking it on himself to hold the door open. After 
half an hour a guest w at liberty to withdraw, but a 
dinner party i*aiely breaks up till half past ten or later, 
if cards and dancing follow. 

As to the individual etiquette of the table, on seating 
himself a guest draws off his gloves, and lays them in his 
lap under the napkin, which should be spread lightly not 
tucked in the dress. The raw oysters are eaten with a 
fork ; the soup, only a ladlef ul to each plate, is sipped 
from the side of the spoon, without noise, or tilting the 
plate. TL head should never stoop toward the plate or 
cup, but the shoulders kept G^'^aight and the food lifted 
to the mouth, the head bent naturally a little, A quiet 
celerity in eating is preferable to the majestic deliberation 
which many people consider genteeL Bread should bo 
broken, never cut at table, and should be eaten morsel 
by morsel, not crumbled into soup or gravy.- Food 
should not be mixed on the plate. Sweet com is brought 
on, tied in its husk 'by a strip of leaf, and should be 
eaten from the cob, breaking the ear in two, and holding 
the piece in the left hand. Asparagus should not be 
touched with the fingers, but the tender part cut up, 
and eaten with the fork. Fish is eaten with the fork, 
assisted by a piece of bread in the left hand. Macca* 
roni is cut and taken with the fork, unless served witli 
the tomatoes, when a teaspoon is allowed, as with green 
peas, and stewed tomatoes alone. Cheese is cnunblad 



:\\

with the fork aud eaten with it, never touched by the 

fingers. Pastry should be broken by the fork without 
tbe aid of a unifo. Game and chicken are cut up, nevei 
if)i(jked witli the fingers, unless in the indulgence of a 
family dinner, when the bone may be held in one hand 
and eaten. Pears are hold by the stem to bo pared 
and then cut and eaten like apples, beginning to remove 
the skin at the blossom end. Oranges are held on a 
fork while peeled and divided without breaking the skin. 
Cherries in pie, or natural, should have the stones 
passed to the napkin hold at the lips and returned to 
the plate, and grape seeds and skins are disposed of in 
the same way. Salt is left on the edge of the plate, not 
•on the table. Ladies take but a single glass of any wine 
at most, having their glasses half -filled with champagne 
a second time. It is beginning to be the custom to take 
soft bread as well as ice-cream with cake. Cocoanut 
pudding looks like pie, but is helped and eaten with a 
spoon. Small meringues are best eaten with a dpoon, 
though the practice is to take them in the fingers. 



SOCIAL OBSERVANCES, 



nil 



'Vuw jjimplest society duty is, that of making calls. A 
now OA)mer should return each call within two weeks 
aiiev h is made. After this, a call once in six months 
or a year, serves to keep up acquaintance. Calls are 
due to a hostess two days after a dinner party, and two 
days after a ball, and a week af tei- a small party, though 
these are amply fultilled by leaving one's card in the 
ease of a gentleman, a pei'sonal call being polite from a 
lady who has more time. 

In town, leaving a card with the comer bent signifies 
that it was left by its owner in person, not sent by a 
servant. Bending the edges of a card, means that the 
visit was designed for the young ladies of the house, as 
weU as the mistress of it. If there is a visitor with the 
family whom you wished to see, a separate card should 
be left for that person, naming him or her to th# ser- 
vant. A card should also be left for the host, if the call 
was designed as a family matter, but more than three 
are not left at one house. 

Visits of condolence are paid within a v/eek after the 
funeral, and are as well expressed hj leaving a card and 
kind inquiries of the servant. This is the only proper 
thing to do in case of sickness, beside asking if one can 



T i

be of use. ViHitii of congratulation are paid in person. 
After the birth of a child, cards and inquiries are left 
at the door, when the lady is able to receive her friends, 
she sends her card in return " with thanks for kind in- 
quiries," after which calls are made on her in person. 

Bending the corners of the cards to signify "condo« 
lence," "felicitation," "to take leave," etc., is not used 
so much as a penciled word or two, to express one's 
" kind inquiries," if there is trouble in the house, or 
"best wishes," if there is a wedding, or engagement. 

The P. P. C. card when one is going away, is a con- 
venient way of letting friends know of your absence, the 
initials of "pour prendre cong^" being often relinquished 
for the plain English " to take leave. " On returning, 
cards are sent to all the friends one wishes to see, with 
one's address, and receiving day, when one day of the 
week is sat apart for company. 

From three to Ix are proper calling hourg,. and a 
visit may be from five minutes to half an hour, never 
longer, unless with a very intimate friend. A gentle- 
man leaves his umbrella in the hall, but carries hat 
and (jane with him, keeping the former in his left hand, 
never venturing to lay it on table or rack, unless in- 
vited to do so by the lady of the house. Her not doing 
so is a sign that it is not convenient for her to prolong 
his call. 

A soft hat is tolerated, but the dress hat is usually 
carried. 

The lady of the house rises to receive any guest, un- 
less it be a very young one, and gives her hand. After 
'(h» visit, she receives a gentleman's bow, and if disposed

to be very polite, walks with him to the door of the room. 
She sees a lady visitor to tht street door, if the parlour 
is on the same floor. If not, going to the head of the 
stairs is sufficient courtesy except to elderly guests. A 
gentleman must escort a lady who makes him a busi- 
ness call to the outer door, and to her carriage, if she 
has one. A caller should take leave as soon as possible 
on the arrival of another visitor, unless asked to stay 

Where a lady has a large acquaintance, it is most con- 
venient for her to set apart a day for receiving their 
calls, of which she admonishes them by her visiting card 
on which the day of the week is pencilled. 

Unless specially invited otherwise, her friends will 
confine their visits to that day of the week. 

To these afternoons the hostess appears in usual 
afternoon dress; her rooms are attractive with floweni 
and pictures, but no refreshments are served. Her 
guests find her, not sitting at the receipt of customs, 
but busy with some elegant trifle of lace or wool-work, 
writing letters, or touching a sketch, to be laid aside on 
the entrance of visitors. I 

The set afternoon reception is announced by this form 
of card, the hostess usually preferring to have some 
young lady with her to add to the attractions of her 
house.

the guests on a tray, and a tiny table to rest the cups on 
placed in the reach of each group. 

Cards are issued for dinner partie»and afternoon recep- 
tions in distinction from evening parties and weddings, 
invitations to which are engraved on note paper. Written 
invitations aro more complimentary than printed ones, 
but the idea of cards and engraved requests is to save 
tho labour of writing notes for a large paHy, or

where one entertains continually. Writt<3n invita- 
tions for the honour and style of the thing, cards 
and engraving for convenience, though this is perhaps 
contrary to the popular notion. Written invitations 
should be as fastidiously correct as printed ones, on 
mill-finished side-fold note sheets with cipher in the 
comer, and written in the same form as cards, unless to 
a familiar friend, when such precision would be absurd. 
Outside envelopes are only used when invitations are 
sent by mail. And whether so requested in the note or 
not, answer to accept or decline should be sent as soon 
as possible, no matter how slight the invitation may be, 
even to dine with a gentleman, or go to a picture gal- 
lery. It will not do to present oneself without a word 
to announce one's coming, or to stay away and appolo- 
gize the first time of meeting. Good breeding is hardly 
shown in nicer points than this. 

The person entering a room is the one to salute the 
company by a good morning, or how do you do, and to 
make his adieus, to which the rest respond. Where a 
stranger enters a small company, each one should be 
separately presented. The guest salutes the hostess and 
host before speaking to anyone else, and if the party is 
large, is introduced to two or three convenient persons 
that he may have somebody to talk to, though in a pri- 
vate house guests mfty accost each other without formal 
presentation. Near the close of a party, the host and 
hostess usually are to be found near the door of the par- 
lour, and guests t^ke leave of them with a bow and 
compliment for a pleasant evening, then pass to the 
dressing rooms after wraps and vanish without further

ceremony. In small circles a bow should be given to 
each person about one, and leave taken of any special 
friend whose conversation has been particularly pleasant. 

A gentleman does not shake hands with a lady not of 
his kindred, unless she offers to do so. Unmarried 
ladies do not give their hands in salute to any but gen- 
tlemen relations. Ladies in any case give the hand, 
the gentleman respectfully presses it without shaking. 
It is a piece of stupid bad breeding, however, not to take 
the hand of anyone offered in ignorance of the rule. 
The best breeding always adapts itself to the customs of 
those about one. 

When a gentleman escorts a lady to a party, he waits 
for her near the door of the ladies' dressing-room till 
she shows herself, gives her his right arm, or gives it to 
the elder lady if he takes two, and goes up to the host- 
ess with her to make salutations, then after a sentence 
or two,, turning away to join the company. After a 
dance with any lady it is proper to take half a turn 
round the room in promenade with her, and take her to 
the refeshment room if she wishes, always leaving her 
with her chaperone. An unmarried lady does rot ask 
gentlemen to call, but the gentleman asks permission 
for the favour of her, or writa to be invited by her 
father or mother.

LITTLE HOUSEKEEPERS. 



It often happens that a good deal of knowledge which 
we are not conscious of possessing — but which finds its 
way somehow into the brains of big and little people as 
well — comes very readiy to hand when it is needed. It 
so happened with Annie and Jennie, whose first practi- 
cal lessons in housekeeping, began after breakfast one 
morning when Bridget was absent at her sister*s funeral 
and in consequence of an accident by which mamma 
sprained her ankle. 

And the doctor had said, with a very wise snake of 
his head, and any amount of wisdom in his eye, that 
"Little Mother" must not step on that foot for three 
days, she grew still whiter with dismay, for Bridget 
would not be back until quite late in the day, and how 
was all the house work to be done and nobody to do it ? 

It was thus that Annie's and Jennie's first practical 
experiences in housekeeping began, and as our object in 
telling you how and what they did is to give you some 
idea how you should manage in similar circumstances 
I must not pass over their mother's first caution : Dffore 
eommencing your work prepare yourselves for it. This 
they did by putting long sleeved aplpns over their

dresses, and rolling back their sleeves, when it was evident 
the right place to begin with was 

THE DINING KOOM. 

The first thing here to do, was the clearing of the 
tjiblo. In this, all the clean silver, china, and dishes 
that had not been used, were first put away in the silver 
drawer, the china closet and on the side-board. Next, 
the dishes' to be cleaned were collected together ; the 
silver and the knives were first put into a pitcher of hot 
water, with the bowls and blades downwards. Next, the 
water was emptied from the glasses, and the coffee from 
.the cups into a basin, and while Annie took these into 
the kitchen and placed them there on the table, Jennie 
gathered the plates in a pile, the cups and the saucers, 
each by themselves, in this way they were quickly and 
easily carried to the kitchen. 

They^were careful not to take too many at once, as 
they would be liable to break them. Then the table- 
cloth was folded and laid in the side-board ; the napkins 
were put in the napkin basket ; the dining room floor 
was nicely swept and the furniture dusted ; the coal stove 
was attended to, that the fire was not too lively and not 
too low ; and then, after kissing and petting mamma a 
few minutes, the little housekeepers set about 

TRE WASHING OF THE DISHEa 

This, of course, with " Little Mother " at the head of 
attairs, was no disagreeable work, you may be sure. The 
large Us dishjpau, as bright as silver, was placed in the

sink ; the hot and cold water faucets turaed on until the 
temperature of the water was hot enough for cleansing 
the dishes, and not too hot for the hands; then the suda 
were made by stirring about in the water the soap-shaker 
(a little tin box with soap in it, and perforated with holes 
having a long handle like a dipper). Then the glasses 
were first washed and quickly wiped on clean dry towels ; 
then the silver ; then the pretty china cups, saucers, 
plates and other dishes, which were then rinsed by pour- 
ing clear hot water over them in another pan, from which 
they were wiped with the coarser towels. This finished, 
Jennie removed the dishes from the kitchen table, putting 
the silver, glass and china away, w^jile Annie washed 
the sauce-pans and the tins, putting them in their places 
in the kitchen ; then brushed the range and swept the 
kitchen floor ; after which they washed their hands well 
and dried them on the roller-towel ; and then our little 
housekeepers set themselves about preparations for 

THE CHAMBER WOEK. 

First, the two little girls went into mamma's room, 
and put on over their bright glossy curls two little 
Martha Washington dusting-caps of pink and blue cam- 
bric, trimmed around the edges with scolloped ruflles, 
and ornamented with i)retty little fanciful bows of pink 
and blue cambric, with scolloped edges. Then Annio 
took the pails and cloths, and Jennie the brushes, and 
brooms, and went up staira. 

The first rule of chamber work is to open the windows 
and turn down the bed clothes to air them well ; beating 
up the pillows and the mattress. Am Annie uid Jennie

always did this th^ first thing after dressing in the morn- 
ing, and before going down to breakfast, the first thing 
now to do was to make up the bed. While Annie went 
to the further side, Jennie remained on the other, and 
thus, each sheet and blanket was brought up and laid 
over straight and smooth, with not a wrinkle in sheet 
or blanket, or a single article out of line. When all was 
done, the spread and blankets were turned neatly back, 
with the pretty ruffled sheet lying back on the nice white 
counterpane ; tbe clothes were all neatly tucked and 
folded at the slides and the corners, and the pillows put 
up against tha headboard. Then, while Annie washed 
the bed-room service, first emptying the waste water, and 
then washing out the cleanest dishes in warm suds, 
Jennie bnished the room, dusted the furniture and put 
the hair and clothes-brushes in order, and arranged the 
bureau and toilet table. They followed the same order 
in their brother John's room, which was all of the cham- 
ber work to be done that day, and then went down stairs. 
By this time thc^ little housekeepers began to feel tired, 
and so they rested a while in their two little easy chairs 
in mamma's room, talking to mamma and each other 
until it came the time for getting ready for the 

LUNCHEON. 

^ John took' his dinner with him to school, and papa 
ate his luncheon down town, and would not be home 
until the five o'clock dinner, there was only mamma and 
the two lit|le girls to partake of this repast together ; and 
as mamma's luncheons were such cosy, tasteful, though 
■imple meals, we may gain some suggestions from the way

our little housekeepers prepaied them. The fii'.I. thing 
to do in getting any meal, is to decide upon the v arious 
dishes to be served. A look at tht) supply of ]f)i( pared 
food was quite disheartening to tae ambitious daaires 
of the little housekeepers, as there was bread and v^ako 
and cold meat in plenty, and it seemed as though thera 
would be no opportunity for practising their skill in 
cooking. But mamma, who saw the troubled look on 
the little faces, made out the following

White Bread. 



Jumbles.

Brown Bread.

Now, it must be remembered, that in this arrange- 
Dcnt, the bread was at hand ready to slice; the ham 
was boiled, ready to cut ; and the strawberries ready in 
the little glass can to be opened. There remained^ 
therefore, jumbles and tea to make, and the cheese 
sandwiches to prepare. Following mamma's advice, 
they first u lertook the jumbles, of which they were to 
make but half the recipe. They selected for this *' Ex- 
cellent Jumbles," in the home cook book, and while 
Jennie held the book and read the ingredients, Annie 
collected them together. Thus : one-hair a cup of but- 
ter, one cup of sugar, and one-half cup of cream, and 
one-half teaspoon of soda. When Jennie came to the 
one egg of the recipe, they had some trouble how they 
should manage to make it half an egg ; but after con* 
ittltatiou with mamma, they concluded to ¥«ry £roiu Um

given rule, and put the whole egg in. Then Jennie reajj 
on ; "A little nutmeg; flour ei i to stitfeu it, so oh 
to bake in rings ; bake quickl^' 

The flour was sifted; jutter and sugar first 

creamed together by Annie, ale Jennie beat the yoke 
of the egg, and added it to the creamed sugar and but- 
ter ; then they put in the nutmeg, the cream and the 
soda ; then the beaten white of the egg, and the sifted 
flour ; then they put the jumbles into the buttered rings 
and baked them. As the oven was quick and hot, I am 
happy to say these jumbles were a succes*. In taking 
them out of the tins when done, they did not pile them on 
one another, but placed t^.enI. carefully about on a large 
plate to cool. Tber the little housekeepers made the 
tea, according to the directions in the Cook Book, and 
also the cheese sandwiches, which were a complete suc^ 
cess. The cutting, of the bread was a difficult task, since 
to be nice the slices shovild be even and thin, but it was 
managed nevertheless ^^ith patience and care. When 
all was ready, the cream nicely whipped, the strawber- 
ries put in the preserve dish, the little round table in 
mamma's room drawn oat, and the luncheon aiTanged, 
they were just ready to sit down to enjoy the fruits of 
their labour, what should they hear but Bridget's voice 
at the door. So it cp me to pass, that with the luncheon 
ended for ^ihis time the practical experiments of our little 
houseke jpers. But it all goes to prove that, if we live 
with our eyes open, we shall all of us find that, with 
such help as our Fiome Cook Book, we shall be ready 
for those emergencies which come to big as well as tht 
UtUe housekeepen, when Bridget is not at hand.

OUR SUSAN'S OPINION OF A KITOHIN. 



" My opinion of a kitchen ?" said Susan, in a tone, with 
a glance, and a wave of h«ir fork that spoke unwritten 
volumes, as she translated the perfection of fried cakes 
from the fryin<( kettle to a tin colander to drain ; " My 
opinion of a kitchen ? Well, that would vary somewhat 
with the mansion that contained it. In any case, how- 
ever, it would be the pleasantest room in the house, if J 
had the ordering of things." r 

The queen of our kitchen said this with a half smile 
and a half apology, as she continued : "It makes a good 
deal of difference, you know, to one who is to spend the 
best part of her time there. I often think that many 
people with whom money is no object, have very lifnited 
idea^of their responsibilities when it comes to the ser- 
vant's quarter in the houses they build, with all they may 
have of modern improvements and conveniences. 

" I have no conceit of those fine houses," said she, 
with considerable asperity of manner, " with not a room 
in it but where a regiment might meander comfortably 
about among the furniture but the kitchen, which is only 
large enough for the range, the sink, the ironing table, 

and the ^cook. Neither for my part, could I ever 

see what those people are thinking about who do not 
keep sei-vauts, and whero th« misiieiis expects to do her

own work, who allow:), of all rooms in the house, her 
kitchen to be built a dark little box of a place, prevaded 
with the sole idea oU'worh. Of work, too, without one 
gleam of cheerfulness about it, and from which everyone 
who enters escapes with a glad feeling of relief. For 
my part," she continued, " I don't see why making fried 
cakes, and baking biscuit, and washing dishes, might not

thijig else one has to do in the way of house work. 

" My opinion of a kitchen, ' as is a kitchen,* is one with 
room enough about for the many little things and com- 
forts that give it a home-like look ; a ' living room,* as w© 
used to call our kitchen in the old home. For instance 
this comes the nearest my idea of it ; always excepting 
that" she said, with a gratified glance around at the 
pretty clock on its pretty bracket, and the newspaper 
rack, (for Susan enjoyed the papers,) at the various nick- 
nacks, and the landscapes, and home views, which Susan 
prized fai* above the costly conventional fruit and game 
pieces on the dining room walls. And then Susan's 
glance wandered, with a pleased softened look to the 
sunny window, with its geranium pots and hanging 
basket, near which the most cheerful of canaries in his 
cage made all the air melodious with song. Here, also, 
stood an easy chair inviting rest for those moments of 
waiting upon work which so often occur, and near it a 
stand with drawers for all sorts of little treasures which 
contained all of fancy work in which Susan ever indulged, 
'* That easy chair, and that window, are great comforta 
to me," (ihe resumed. '^Now. if there was but one

in flo many kitchens, if 1 had to take refuge in a aiiff- 
backed chair in a dark corner or the middle of the room 
where I could reach out and touch the walls all around 
while I was waiting for the biscuit to rise, oi' the cako 
was baking, as I sat there glaring at some dark melan- 
choly paper, instead of this bright cheerful tint of gray, 
with its hints of rose and violet, and then with the 
wood-work about, of an ugly, dingy blue, or mud col- 
oured brown, insteau of this bright-grained wood, with 
gleams of sunshine m il on the darkest days, and that in 
80 easy to keep clean and is as pretty as a pictured I 
think if this wa«» *^>nt k\nd of a kitchen, I would run 
away with the milkman some bright morning — I actu- 
ally think I would." This is a standing joke of o\ir 
Susan's, but one nevertheless that brings fear and con- 
iternation in our household whenever it is revived. ** I 
suppose I was spoiled for that sort of thing in my early 
days," said she, meditatively,, with a look in her eyes 
that went out for the moment, " over the hills and far 
away," to the kitchen, wnere we first found our Susan. 

It was a wide, long room — so wide and long that the 
dresser and clock »hd tables and large old-fashioned 
furniture that stood here and there, never intruded 
themselves, but in )a?*^^.. comely, decorous, but uncom- 
promising dignity, formed each a part of the hannoni- 
ous whole. There was an indescribable charm about 
it, always orderly, alwavs bright and the centre of a 
home-life where iis duties went on in that easy cheerful 
way, a pleasure both to sight and sense. About its 
many windows, all the summer time, the roses clam- 
bered in sweet confusion, and through which the scent

of the fra^ant sweet-briar oame floating in, with the 
song of the woodland birds and the pleasant farm 
sounds, and a vision of the far away hills, in their ever 
varying beauty of light and shadow ; while within, in 
conscious enjoyment of it all, was Susan, stopping mer- 
rily about, making custard pies, or folding the fragrant 
linen, fresh from the line, for the morrow's ironing 
But the prettiest picture of that old kitchen was of a 
winter evening, when the winds blew furiously without, 
of the grand old fire-place, with its heaping wood fire 
over which on the crane the kettle hung, humming and 
singing, and sending up the chimney white clouds of 
steam, while before it stood the tin baker which held 
the rich juicy roast, or the light snowy biscuit, the like 
of which never came out of any range that ever was, or 
will be invented ; while the fire lighted up the fine old 
room with a rich warm glow, as Susan set the table with 
its snowy linen and polished ware, and golden butter, 
and luscious honey in the comb, and all those charming 
fancies she knew so well how to prepare. And to coi^ 
plete the picture, the comfortable easy chairs by the 
fire where the grandmother sat in placid enjoyment with 
her knitting, and not very far away, the father, tired 
with the work of the day, giving himself to the rest and 
comforts of the evening hour. This is the picture that 
rose so vividly before me, but which had faded all too 
suddenly from our Susan^s past 

Ah, well 1 said she, after a time coming out of her 
reverie with a little sigh and back again, to her opinion 
of a kitchen.

§elecfcioii from her small stock of poetical fancies, but 
checking hersolf before reaching the concluding lines of 
this stanza. 

" My opinion," she said, with a sudden change of tone 
and manner as she sniffed the air — is — that until some 
contrivance is invented to carry out all the steam, smoke, 
and smell of frying, that with all my care, and in spite 
of windows, and doors, and ventilators, will hang about 
my kitchen, the millenium won't come ; and if it does, 1 
shan't be in it." 

As she said this, we looked around, and there stood 
the Pater. And we knew by the look in his eyes that he 
had heard these words of Susan's. And thus it will 
happen, that the Pater who is a bom inventor, but who 
in the hurry and worry of business life has limited 
opportunities for the indulgence of this natural bent of 
his genius, will seize upon this idea with the pretext of a 
duty, and with which he will retire to the depths of his 
inner consciousness, there to evolve some strange contriv- 
ance hereafter to assume form and shape for the comfort- 
ing of " Our Susan's " kitchen.

SOUPS. 



" No nselesa dish our table crowds ; 
liarmouiously ranged and consonantly ju«i, 
As in a concert instrumenta reHOund, 
Our ordered diahea in their courses chiuie." 

The basis cf all good soups, is the broth of meat, 
This may be made by boiling the cracked joints of beef, 
veal or mutton, and is best when cooked the day before 
it i« to be eaten. After putting the meat into the pot, 
Ot^Vbr it well with cold water and let it come to a boil, 
when it should be well skimmed. Set the pot where it 
will simmer slowly until it is thoroughly done, keeping 
the pot closely covered the while. The next day, when 
the soup is cold, remove the fat, .which will harden on 
the top of the soup. After this, add the vegetables and 
the herbs you use for seasoning, cooking all well together. 
Before sending to the table, the soup should be strained. 
A good stock for soups may be made from shreds and 
bits of uncooked meat ai^d bones, poultry and the re- 
ma^isofgame. When these are all put together and 
stewed down in the pot, the French term it consomme, 
and use it chiefly in the preparation of brown soups. 

Soups may be varied in many ways, ohiefly in the kinds 
fkf vegetables and diderent seasonings used, — as in herbs,

will cause a violent effervescence. Tt is best to set the

FISH. 



" The •Uyery fish,

Fresh from the wave now cheers 
Oar festive board." 

— A210H. 

Fish are good, when the gills are red, eyes are full, and 
the body of the fish is firm and stiff. After washing them 
well, they should be allowed to remain for a short time in 
salt water sufficient to cover them ; before cooking, wipe 
them dry, dredge lightly with flour, and season with salt 
and pepper, Salmon trout and other small fish are 
usually fried or broiled ; all large fish should be put in a 
cloth, tied closely with twine, and placed in cold water, 
when they may be put over thr fire to boil. When fish 
are baked, prepare the fish the same as for boiling, and 
put in the ^^ n on a wire gridiron, over a dripping pan.

POULTRY. 



— OOWM 



When poultry is brought into the kitchen for use, ik 
should be kept as cool as possible. The best position 
in which to place it is with the breast downwards on a 
shelf or marble slab. The crop should be taken out. 
Choose fowls with a thin, transparent skin, white and 
delicate. Time required to boil poultry : a chicken 
will take abput 20 minutes ; a fowl about 40 minutes ; a 
small turkey an hour and a half; a large turkey two 
hours or more. . 

BOILED FOWL. 

Take a young fowl and fill the inside with oybters ; 
place in a jar and plunge into a kettle of water ; boil for 
one and one-half hours; there will be a quantity of 
giuvy in the jar from the juice of the fowl and the 
oysters ; make this into white sauce with the addition 
of egg, cream, or a little flour and butter ; add oysters, 
or serve up plain with the fowl. This is very nice with 
the addition of a little parsley to the sauce.

ROAST TURKEY OR CHICKEN. 

Having picked and drawn the fowls, wash them well 
in two or three waters ; wipe them dry ; dredge them 
with a little flour inside and out, and a little pepper and 
salt ; prepare a dressing of bread and cracker crumbs, 
fill the bodies and crops of the fowls and then bake them 
from two to three hours ; baste them frequently while 
roasting ; stew the giblets in a sauce-pan ; just before 
serving, chop the giblets fine ; after taking up the 
chicken, and the water in which the giblets were boiled, 
add the chopped giblets to the gravy of the roast fowl ; 
thicken with a little flour, which has been previously 
wet with the water ; boil up, and serve in a gravy-dish 
Roast chickens and turkey should be accompanied with 
celery and jellies. 

TO BOIL A TURKEY. 

Mrs. Kobert Beaty. 

Make a stuffing for the craw of chopped bread and 
butter, cream, oysters, and the yolks of eggs ; sew it in, 
and dri^dge flour over the turkey, and put it to boil in 
cold water, with a spoonful of salt in it, and enough 
water to .^over them well ; let it simmer for two hours 
and a half, or, if small, less time ; skim it while boil^ 
ing ; it looks nicer if wrapped in a cloth dredged with 
flour : f!drve it with drawn butter, in which put some

should de cooked thoroughly. Stew the inwards till 
tender, and till there is but little water ; chop lihem ar u 
mix in gravy from the dripping-pan ; thicken with brown 
Hour ; season with salt, pepper, and butter. Cranberry 
or new made apple sauce, is ^ood with them. 

TO STEW BIRDS. 

Mrfl. Jas. Beaty. 

Wash and stuff them with bread crumbs, seasoned 
with pepper, salt, butter or chopped salt pork, and fasten 
them tight. Line a stew pan with slices of bacon, add a 
i^uart of water and a bit of butter the size of a goose egg, 
i)r else four slices of salt pork. Add if you like sliced 
onions, and sweet ^.orbs and mace. Stew till tender, then 
take them up and strain the gravy over them. Add boil- 
ing water if the liquor is too much reduced. 

ON THE PREPARATION OF HASHES, GRAVIES, 

AND SAUCEa 

Mrs. Jas. Beaty. 

There is nothing worse for the health, or for the palate, 
than a poor hash while a good hash is not only a 
favourite dish in most families, but an essential article 
of economy r "d convenience. For this reason a separate 
article is devoted to this subject. The following are the 
ways'in which hashes are spoilt. The first is by cooking 
them. Meat, when once cooked, should only be heated. 
If it is again stewed or fried, it tends to make it hard o»

fcough, and diminishes its flavour. The second is by fry- 
ing the butter or graV' '^- which they are prepared. It 
has been shown that iis is very injurious to the health- 
fulness of food. Butter and oils may be melted without 
changing their nature, but when coolced, they become 
much more indigestible and injurious to weak stomachs. 
The third mode of injuring hashes is by putting in flour 
in such ways that it is not properly cooked. Flour 
.dredged on to hashes while they are cooking imparts the 
raw taste of dough. The fourth mode is by putting in 
so much water as to make them vapid, or else so much 
grease as to make them gross. The fifth is by seasoning 
them with so little care, that they either have very little 
savory taste, or else are so hot with pepper and spice as to 
be unhealthy. If a housekeeper will follow these direc- 
tions, or give them to a cook who will follow them exactly, 
she will always have good and healthful hashes. 

TO CURRY CHICKEN 

BCin. W. Arthtin. 

Slice an onion and brown in a little butter ; add a 
spoonful of curry powder ; allow it to remain covered 
for a few minutes to cook ; add a little more butter and 
put in chicken, veal, &c., kc; cut up small, thicken 
with a little flour. This is exellent.

quently with melted butter ; or when half done taker out 
the chicken and finish by broiling it upon a gridiron 
over bright coals j pour over it melted butter and the 
juices in the pan in which it waa baked. 

CHICKSN FRICASSEE. 

Sarah Pa^^e. 

Cut up the chickens and put on the fire in a kettle 
with cold water sufficient to cover, add a littk salt or 
salt pork sliced, if you like : boil until tender, and &sk » 
ap and put in part of a head of celery. When tender 
have ready hot baking-powder biscuits broken open and 
laid on a platter ; on this place the cshicken ; thioi;en 
the gravy with flour moistened with water or milk, iAA 
povLT it over the chicken and biscuits. If you prefer, 
use a good-sized piece of butter to season instead of the 
salt pork. Oysters are an addition. 

FRIED CHICKEN 

Mrs. Bansher. 

Cut the chicken in pieces, lay it in salt and water, 
which change several times; roll each piece in florr; 
fry in very hot lard or batter, season with salt and pep- 
per ; fry parsley with them also. Make a gravy of 
cream seasoned with salt, pepper and a little mace, 
thickened with a little flour in the pan in which tb« 
chickens were fried, pouring off the lard.

CURRY. 

MKsg Brokovski 

To make curry with rabbit, chicken, or any other i 
meat, flour the meat and fry it a nice light brown ; fiyj 
also two large onions in the same way ; mix a table- 
spoonful of curry powder, and a small quantity of! 
cayenne in a tea cup, with warm water to the consistency] 
of cream and cover every part of the meat with thei 
mixture; have ready some nice stock or thin gravy; 
put all together into a stew-pan, and let it stew gently 
for twenty minutes ; before serving slice two or three 
apples, let them stew away ; this addition is thought to 
be p. great improvement, as it makes the curry milder;

butter; pepper and salt and chopped parsley to taste; 
yolks of two hard boiled eggs rubbed fine with the back 
of a silver spoon, added to the meat ; mix up into a paste 
with as little handling as may be ; nor must the paste be 
too wet to mould readily ; make with floured hands into 
rolls or ovate balls, roll in flour until well coated, and 
fry a few at a time, lest crowding should injure the 
shape, in nice dripping, or a mixture half lard and half

pans and set in the oven a few minutes to brown very 
slightly. 

DUCKS. 

Miss S. P. 

When roasted, use dressing as for turkey, with the 
addition of a few slices of onion. Many cooks lay over 
the game slices of onions, which take away the fishy 
flavour, removing the onion before serving. Mako a 
sauce with the drippings in the pan in which the game 
is roasted, and to which are put the chopped giblets, 
which are previously well cooked ; thicken the gravy with 
brown ftour, moistened with water. Serve with currant 
jelly.

about as for chicken salad ; season well, put into a dish 
and pour the remnant of the juice in which it was cooked 
over it. This will jelly when cold, and can then be sliced 
or set on the table in shape. Nice for tea or lunch. The 
knack of making this simple dish is not having too much

GENERAL RULES FOR COOKINa MEATS. 

All salt meat should be put on in cold water, that the 
nait may be extracted while cooking. Fresh meat, which 
is boiled to be served with sauces at the table, should be 
put to cook in boiling water ; when the outer fibres con- 
tract, the inner juices are preserved. 

For making soup, put the meat over in cold w^ ter, to 
extract the juices for the broth. 

In boiling meats, if more water is needed, add that 
which is hot, and be careful to keep the water on the 
meat constantly boiling. 

Remove the scum when it first begins to boil. The 
more gently meat boils, the more tender it will become. 
Allow twenty minutes for boiling each pound of fiesh 
meat. 

Roast meats require a brisk fire. Baste often. Twenty 
minutes is required for roasting each pound of fresh 
meat. The variation in roasted meats consist^s simply

Put in a saucepan, one ounce of butter, a small onion

and put it over the fire ; whun hot, shake in two table- 
spoons of flour, and when it becomes brown, put in one

this over a nicely broiled beefsteak. 

BROILED BEEFSTEAK. 

Lay a thick tender steak upon a gridiron over hot 
coals, having greased the bars with butter before the 
steak has been put upon it ; (a steel gridiron with slender 
bars is to be preferred, the broad flat iron bars of grid- 
irons commonly used fry and scorch the meat, impart- 
ing a disagreeable flavour). When done on one side, 
have ready your platter warmed with a little butter on 
it ; lay the steak upon the platter with the cooked side 
down, that the juices which have gathered may run on 
the platter, but do not press the meat ; then lay your 
beefsteak again upon the gridiron quickly and cook the 
other side. When done to your liking, put again on the

warm for a few moments, but not to let the butter be-

salt and pepper while cooking. If your meat is tough, 
pound well with a steak mallet on both sides.

TO BOIL CORNED BEEF. 

Mn. J. Beaty. 

Put the beef in water enough to cover it, and let it 
heat slowly, and boil slowly, and be careful to take off 
the grease. Many think it much improved by bo\ling 
potatoes, turnips, and cabbages with it. In this case 
the vegetable must be pealed and all the grease care- 
fully skimmed as fast as it rises. Allow about twenty 
minutes of boiling for each pound of meat. 

BEEF OR VEAL STEWED WITH APPLES. 

Mrs. James Beaty. 

Rub a stewpan with butter ; cut the meat in thin 
slices, and put in with pepper,, salt, and apple, sliced 
fine; some would add a little onion. Cover it tight, 
and stew till tender. 

BEEFS HEART. 

Marion Harland. 

Wash the heart well, and cut into squares half an inch 
long. Stew them for ten minutes in enough water to 
cover them. Salt the water slightly to draw out the 
blood, and throw it away as it rises in scum to the top. 
Take out the meat, strain the liquor, and return the chop- 
ped heart to it, with a sliced onion, a great spoonful of 
catsup, some parsley, a head of celery chopped fine, and 
cayenne pepper, with a large lump of butter. Stew un- 
til the meat is very tender, when add a tablespoonful ol 
broivned flour to thicken, Boii up once, and serve.

TO COOK A HAM (VERY FINE). 

Mrs. J. Beaty 

\ 
Boil a common-sized ham four or five hours, then 

skin the whole and fit it tor the table ; then set it in an 

oven for half an hour, then cover it thickly with pounded 

rusk or bread crumbs, and set it back for half an hour. 

Boiled ham is always improved by setting it into an 

oven for nearly an hour, till much of the fat fries out; 

and this also makes it more tender. 

TO BOIL A LEO OF VEAL OB MUTTON. 

Miss Kate Beaty. 

Make a stuffing of bread and a quarter as much of 
siilt pork, chopped fine and seasoned with sweet herbs, 
pepper and salt. Make deep gashes, or, what is better, 
take out the bone with a carving-knife and fill up with 
stufiing, and sew up the opening with strong thread. 
When there is a flap of flesh lap it over the opening and 
sew it down. Put it into a large pot and fill it with 
water, putting in a tablespoonful of salt, and let it sim- 
mer slowly tjiiree hours. If it is needful to add water 
pour in boUimg water.

Melt a good lump of butter, about two ounces, over a 
slow fire, into a tablespoonful of flour ; when it has 
simmered a little add some chopped onion (to taste) and 
A dessert spoonful of chopped parsley ; when brown 
season with pepper and add a little stock gravy, or 
water ; mince the meat, put it in'with the rest, and let

teaspoonful of flour. Add a little catsup or sauce of 
any kind. 

A LA MODE BEEF. 

Miss Sarah Pafi^eb 

Take a piece of beef four or five inches thick, and 
with a knife make small holes entirely through it at 
slight distances apart. Then take strips of fat salt pork, 
roll them in pepper and cloves. Lay on a pan, cover 
closely, and put over in a steamer, and steam for three 
hours. When done, thicken the gravy in the pan with a 
little flour. This is excellent when eaten as cold meat

Mrs. Carter. 

For piescrving one hundred pounds beef : Six pounds 
salt, twc ounces salt-petre, two tablespoons soda, two 
pounds sugar, four gallons water ; mix well together ; 
sprinkle the bottom of the barrel with salt ; put in the 
beef with, very little salt between each layer ; pour over

TO CORN BEEF. 

Mrs. A. M. GibU 

To each gallon of cold water, put one quart of rock 
salt, one ounce of salt-petre and four ounces of brown 
sugar, (it need not be boiled), as long as any salt remains 
undissolved, the meat will be sweet. If any scum should 
rise, scald and skim well ; add more salt, salt-petre and 
sugar ; as you put each piece of meat into the brine, rub 
over with salt. If the weather is hot, gash the meat to 
the bone, and put it in salt. Put a flat stone or some 
weight on the meat to keep it under the brine. 

Or this : To every four gallons of water allow two 
pounds of brown sugar and six pounds of salt, boil about 
twenty minutes, taking off the scum ; the next day turn 
it on the meat packed in the pickling tub ; pour off this 
brine ; boil and strain every two months, adding three 
ounces of brown sugar and half a pound of common salt 
It will keep good a year. Sprinkle the me^t with salt 
the next day, wipe dry before turning the pickle over it. 
Letit entirely cover the meat ; add four ounces salt-petre.

Three and one-half pounds of cold roast veal chopped 
fine, one tablespoon of salt and one of pepper, one-half 
of a nutmeg, four or five rolled crackers, three eggs. If 
the veal is thin, add a piece of butter half a» large as an 
^g<g^ and a tablespoon of cream. Form all this in a large 
rpU, and spot the roll over with bits of butter ; then strew 
over it the pounded crackers, (a little of the cracker should

glowly two hours and a half, take it out, skim it, remove 
all the fat, except a layer half an inch thick ; cut off with 
a sharp knife all the black-looking outside ; put the ham 
into your dripping pan, fat side uppermost, grate bread 
crust over it and sprinkle a teaspoon of powdered sugar 
over it ; put it in the oven for half an hour, until it is a 
beautiful brown. Eat cold ; cut the nicest portion in 
elices ; the ragged parts and odds and ends can be 
chopped fine and usvid for sandwiches; or, by adding 
three eggs to one pint of chopped ham, and frying brown, 
you have a delicious omelette for breakfast or lunch. The 
bones should be put in a soup -kettle, the rind and fat 
should be rendered and strained for frying potatoes and 
crullers. Ham cooked in this way will go much farther 
than when cooked in the ordinary manner.

Mrs. P. B. Aver. 

Boil your ham tender; cover it with the whifce of a raw

SALTING PORK. 

A. M. a 

Cover the bottom of the barrel with salt an inch deep ; 
put down one layer of pork and cover that with salt half 
an inch thick ; continue this until all your pork is disposed 
of ; then cover the whole with strong brine ; pack aa 
tight as possible, the rind side down or next to the barrel ; 
keep the pork always under the brine by using an inner 
cover and clean stones. Should any scum arise, pom 
off the brine, scald it, and add more salt. Old brine can 
be boiled down, well skimmed, and used for a fresh supply. 

CURING HAMS. 

Mrs. Mulford. 

Hang up the hams a week or ten days, the longer the 
tendei^er and better, if kept perfectly sweet; mix for 
each good-sized ham, one teacup of salt, one tablespoon 
of molasses, one ounce of salt-petre ; lay the hams in a 
clean dry tub ; heat the mixture and rub well into tie 
hams, especially around the bones and recesses ; repeat 
the process once or twice, until all the mixture ia 
used ; then let the hams lie two or three days, when 
they must be put for three weeks in brine strong enough 
to bear an egg ; then soak eight hours in cold water ; 
hang up to dry in the kitchen or other more convenient 
place for a wiaek or more ; smoke from three to five 
^ya^ being careful not to heat the hams. Corn cobs

SAUCES FOR MEAT OR FISH. 



< DRAWN BUTTER 

Drawn butter forms the b isis of most saucas. From 
this a great variety may be made, by adding to this dif- 
ferent flavours — anchovies, ochra onions, celevy, par- 
sley, mmt, and relishes — using those flavours, which re 
suitable for the meat, game, or fish, with which the sauces 
are to be served. A good standard receipt for drawn but- 
ter is as follows : 

Rub on© tablespoon\ of flour with one-quarter of a 
pound of butter ; when well mixed, put in a saucepan 
with a tablespoon of milk or water ; set in a dish of 
boiling water, shaking it well until the butter molts and 
is near boiling. It should not be set directly on the 
stove or over the co&ls, as the heat will make the butter 
oily and spoil it

To four pounds of large red tomatoes, take t^TTO pounda 
of good brown sugar, one pint of cider vinegar, half ounce 
of cloves, and half ounce of stick cinnamon ; stew 
all together in a preserving kettle until the tomatoes are 
cooked ; take the tomatoes out and put them on dishes 
to cool, letting the syrup go on simmering slowly ; when 
the tomatoes are cold return them to the syrup for a little 
while ; let them become cold before putting them in the 
jars. The syrup must be boiled down as thick aa 
molasses, and poured cold over the tomatoes ; tie them 
lown with bladder or waxed paper. 

PICKLED CUCUMBERa 

Mn. Packard. 

Wash with care your cucumbers, and place in jam. 
iidke a weak brine (r handful of salt to a gallon and a 
half of water). When scalding hot, turn over the cucum- 
bers and cover ; repeat this process three mornings in 
succession, taking care to skim thoroughly. On the 
fourth day have ready a porcelain kettle of vinegar, to 
which has been added a piece of alum the size of a wal- 
nut. When scalding hot, put in as many cucumbers as 
may be covered with the vinegar ; do not let them boil, 
but skim off as soon as scalded through, and replace* 
with others, adding each time a small piece of alum. 
When this process is through, throw out the vinogai' and 
replace with good cider or white wine vinegar; add 
spices, mu9tard seed, aud red peppers. Sort the pickleH

and place in stone or glass jars, turn over the hot spiced 
vinegar ; seal and put away the jars not needed for 
immecliate use. Pickles^hus prepared are fine and crisp 
at the expiration of a year. Those that are kept in open- 
mouth jars may be covered with a cloth, which will need 
to be taken off and rinsed occasionally. I prefer green 
peppers, and prepare them with cucumbers in brine. 
They are not as apt to become soft 

DRESSING SALAD. 

Mrs. Riley. 

In dressing salad it should be thoroughly saturated 
with oil, and seasoned with salt and pepper before vin- 
egar is added. The salt should not be dissolved in the 
vinegar but in the oil, by which means it is more equally 
distributed through the salad. 

CUCUMBEKS FOR PRESISNT USE. 

Mn. Riley. 

The best way of utilising cucumbers for present use 
is to parboil them in a solution of watet, vinegar, and 
salt. They should be split in two before boiling, and, 
if done properly, will present a beautiful green colour. 

TOMATO MUSTARD.

PICKLED OYSTER^ ' 

Mn. Carl Hammond. 

Wash the oysters and Bcald «them in Btrong salt and 
water ; skim them out and thi^w into cold water ; scald 
vinegar well and whole peppers ; let it get cold. Put 
the oysters in a stone jar ; make liquor to cover them of

BRINE THAT PRESERVES BUTTER A' YEAR. 

"Mn. D. McCraney. 

To three gallons of brine, strong enough to bear an egg, 
add one-quarter pound good loaf sugar, and one tablespoon- 
ful of saltpetre ; boil the brine, and when it is cold strain 
carefully.-* Pack butter closely in small jars, and allow the 
brine to cover the butter to the depth of at least foiur 
inches. Hfhis completely excludes the air. If practicable 
make your butter into small rolls, wrap each carefully 
in a clean muslin cloth, tying up with a string ; place a 
weight over the butter to keep it all submerged in the 
brine. This mo46 i^ most recommended by those who

BOILED POTATOES. 

Old potatoes are better for being peeled and put in 
cold water an hour before being put over to boil. They 
should then be put into fresh cold water, when set over 
the fire. New potatoes should always be put into boiling 
water, and it is best to prepare them just in time for 
cooking. Are better steamed than boiled. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Mrs. F. D. J. 

feel the potatoes, and let them stand in cold water 
for half an hour ; then put in the steamer over boiling 
water and cook them until mealy and qv/lte tender. Have 
ready an earthen basin, or. a bright tin pan, into which 
you will put your potatoes, so that while mashing and 
preparing, they can be kept on the stove and hot. Now 
wash well and finely with the potatoe-masher, and then 
season with salt ; allow a generous piece of butter^gand 
lastly, add a tea cup of rich milk ; mix altogether well, 
and then take up on a deep dish.

SOUTHERN WAY OF BOILING RICE. 

Mrs. Stotasbuty. 

Pick over the rice ; rinse it in cold water until perfectly 
clean, then put it in a pot of boiling water, allowing a 
quart of water to less than a teacup of rice ; boil it hard 
seventeen minutes ; drain off the water very close, and 
let it steam fifteen minutes with the lid off. When care- 
fully done in this way, each kernel of rice stands out by 
itself, while it is perfectly tender. The water in whi<^ 
the rice has be<m boiled makes, it is said, good starch fof 
muslin, if boile<i a few minutes by itself.

it gets too dry add a few spoonsful of water. 

ONIONS— BOILED. 

Select those of unifoim size ; remove the outer skin, 
then boil until tender in a large quantity of milk and

Peel and slice and fry in lard or butter ; season with 
pepper and salt, and serve hot. 

MUSHROOMS— FRIED. 

When peeled put them into hot butter and let them

BAKING POWDER. 



BAKING POWDER 



IW 



'il 



:ii ' 



>l\ 



Is A t^x\ «nience which the chemistry of the nineteenth 
century ha* given to the cook ; its uses are indicated in 
the foUowii'iA pages ; a question is sometimes asked as to 
the healthi'UAOSs of Baking Powder, it may be replied 
that a good Oi'iJAm Tartar baking powder will, not only 
not injurt* the lAOst delicate constitution, but may prove 
in many cases highly beneficial, whilst those in which 
Lime phosphates And Alum are used should be avoided. 

To be certain ol its composition the cook might prepare 
her own baking powder ; it is, however, confessedly diffi- 
cult to obtain pure ingredients for this purpose at retail, 
no article being more generally found adulterated than 
Cream of Tartar, li is, therefore, safest to purchase the 
powder of a respectable maker who procures his supplies 
on a large scale, fiom places of production, and can test 
their purity. 

In using baking pt>wder, the proper proportion should, 
in every case, be mixed intimately and uniformly with 
the dry flour, if shoiiening is to be used, it, also, should 
be mixed with the flour before wotting, the best powders 
give ample time for kneading, etc., but some — those using 
Tartaric Acid for instance— require expeditious use, else 
their effero will be lost from the too rapid production of 
gas. 

Unlike yeast, which changes to some extent the nature 
of all the flour used in a batch, and entirely destroys a 
portion of it, for the production of gas, baking powder 
leaves the flour quite unchanged, there is, ther.iore, no 
danger from yeast spores, which may have escaped alive 
from insufficient baking, obtaining access t« the stomach ; 
tliese latter are the cause of pains and eructations which 
frequently follow the use of warm yeast bread.

SNOW DRIFTS. 

Mrs, S. McMaster. 

Half a box of gelatine, one pint of bollinj^ wntor, juice 
of two lemons, two cups of sugar, whites of five eggs ; 
dissolve the gelatine in the water ; add the lemon an^i 
sugar mixed together ; put in mould to cool ; when cool, 
hut not cold, take the whites of the eggfi beaten stiff. 
sweetened and flavoured, and float th^m en boiling milk 
for about one minute. Now take the gelatine from your 
muald (instantly place the mould in cold water), and 
with a fork, beat up the gelatine that has become firm 
into bits, but not into liquid. Now take your mo 'd and 
add spoon about of the broken up jelly and the whites of 
eggs, filling up the mould with the jelly that became soft 
in spite of you ; place to cool. Serve on a dish sur- 
rounded by a custard made from the yolks of the eg^;s 
and one more ; one pint of milk. 

MACEDOINE OF FRUIT. 

Wine jelly and fruit in alternate layers frozen together. 
The fruit may be of any and all sorts, and may be can-

place the monld in Fait and ice prepared Its for freezing 
ice cream ; cover closely, and let it remain several houi-s. 

A NICE DESSERT DISH. 

Mrs. J. Thorney, 

Fill a quart bowl with alternate layers of thinly sliced 
api)les and sugar, and add half a cup of water, covered 
with a saucer, held in place by a weight ; bake slowly 
three houra ; let it stand until cold, and you will turn 
out a round mass of clear red slices, irnbedded in firm 
jelly. For an accompaniment to a dessert of blano 
mange, rennet custard, cold rice pudding, or similar dishes, 
or even with nice bread and butter, there is nothing 
better.

Fniit for preserving should be carefully ^selected 
removing all that are imperfect. They are in the best 
condition when not fully ripe, and as soon as possible 
after they are picked. Small fruit should not be 
allowed to stand over night after they are picked when 
they are to be preserved. Use only the finest sugar for 
preserving. When fruit is sealed in glass cans, wrap 
paper of two or three thicknesses around the cans. The 
chemical action of light will afiect the quality of the 
preserves when perfectly aii -tight. With this precau- 
tion, glass cans are preferable to any other for preserT- 
ing fruit. One-half a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit 
is a good rule for canned fruit, although many house- 
keepers use but one-quarter of a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit. 

An excellent rule for canning the larger fruits, as 
peaches, pears, etc., is to place them in a steamer over 
a kettle of boiling water, laying first a cloth in the bot-

torn of the steamer. Fill this with the fiuit and cover 
tightly. Let them steam for fifteen minutes, or until 
they can be easily pierced with a fork (some fruits will 
require a longer time). Make a syrup of sugar of the right 
consistency. As the fruit is steamed, drop each for a 
moment in the syrup, then place in the cans, having 
each one half full of fruit, and then fill up with the hot 
%yrup, then cover and seal. 

A SUGGESTION. 

For canning all large fruits, where no other method 
is given by contributors, the directions for canning large 
fruits are given in the recipe for Preserved Peaches. 
For canning all of the small fruits, follow the directions 
given in Preserved Cherries. They are both excellent. 
If less sugar is preferred use one-quarter of a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. The syrup should be pre- 
pared by adding a pint of water in your preserving ket- 
tle to each pound and a-half of sugar ; let it boil up 
gently and skim until perfectly clear, when it is ready 
for the fruit. 

SUGARED FRUITS. 

Beat the white of the egg just enough to break, then 
dip fine stems of cherries or currants into the egg and 
then into powdered sugar, and dry on a sieve. 

BAKED APPLES. 

Pare as many apples as you wish of some nice variety, 
neither sweet nor sour ; core them by using an apple-

the cavities with sugar, a little butter, and some gi-ound 
cinnamon, if you like ; set them in the oven and bake 
until done. 

BAKED PEARS. 

Place in a stone jar, first a layor of pears (without part- 
ing) ; then a layer of sugar, then pears, and so on until 
the jar is full. Then put in as much water as it will 
hold. Bake in oven three hours.

QUINCE PRESERVE. 

Mrs. BendelarL 

Pare, core, and quarter your fruit, then weigh it and 
allow an equal quantity of white sugar. Take the peel- 
ings and cores and put in a pregervicg kettle ; cover 
them with water and boil for half an hour ; then strain 
through a hair sieve and put the juice back into the 
kettle and boil the quinces in it a L 'le at a time until 
they are tender ; lift out as they fa,ro done with a drainer 
and lay on a dish ; if the liquid seem<^ scarce add more 
water. When all are done throw in the sugar and allow 
it to boil ten minutes before putting in the quinces ; let 
them boil until they change colour, say one hour and a 
quarter, on a slow lire ; while they are boiling occasion- 
ally slip a silver spoon under them to see that they do 
not bum, but ou no account stir thciu. Have two fresh 
lemons cut in thin slic«B, and when the fruit is being put 
in jars lay a slice or two in each.

BAKED QUINCES.

One dozen nice quinces, cored and well nibbed. Put 
in baking pans, and fill the centre with pulverized sugar, ^ 
Bake and serve cold, with or without cream. 

PKESERVED PEACHES. 

Select peaches of tine quality and firm. If too ripe 
they are not likely to keep perfectly. Pare them and 
place them in a steamer over boiling water and cover 
tightly ; an earthen plate placed in the steamer under 
the fruit will preserve the juices, which afterwards may 
be strained and added to the syrup. Let them steam 
for fifteen minutes or until they can be easily pierced 
with a fork ; make a syrup of the first quality of sugar, 
and as the fruit is steamed drop each peach into the 
syrup for a few seconds, then take out and place in the 
cans ; when the cans are full, pour over the fruit the hot 
syrup and seal immediately. Inexperienced house- wives 
will do well to remember that the syrup should be well 
skimmed before pouring over the fruit. We prefer the 
proportions of half a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit 
for canning, although many excellent house-keepers use 
less. This rule is excellent for all of the large fruits—j 
as pears, quinces, apples, etc.

Mrs. Midgley, 

To six pounds of pears, four pounds of sugar, two 
coffee cups of water, the juice of two lemons, and the 
rind of one, a handful of whole ginger ; boil all together 
for twenty minutes, then put in your pears and boil till 
soft, say about a quarter of an hour ; take them out and 
boil your syrup a little longer ; then put back your fruit 
and give it a boil ; bottle whilst hot ; add a little cochi- 
neal to give them a nice colour. 

PRESERVED CHERRIES. 

Jennie June. 

Stone the fruit, weigh it, and for every pound take 
three-quarters of a pound of susfar. First dissolve the 
sugar in water in the proportion uf a pint of water to a 
pound and a-half of sugar ; then add the fruit and let it 
boil as fast as possible for half an hour, till it begins to 
jelly. As soon as it thickens put in pots, cover with 
brandied paper, »ext the fruit, and then cover closely 
from the air.

six hours ; boil two hours, (water as well) ; then add 
eight pounds of crushed sugar ; boil one hour longer, or

warm, squeeze through a coarse cloth or flannel, and 
put the juice on in a new tin pan or porcelain kettle ; 
one quart of juice requires two pounds of sugar, or a 
pound to a pint ; boil fifteen minutes ; to be a nice 
colour the currants should not c(5me in contact with 
iron spoons or tin dishes, unless new and bright ; should 
be made quickly. It never fails to jelly good if the cur- 
rants are not too ripe. The same method for jam, only 
do not strain the currants, but mash them well. Cur-

•<Sw«eti to the Sweet," 

In or<Jer to understand the secret of CAittiy mnktng,Jlt 
will be necessary to understand the action of heat upon 
sugar. The first step in this process is the reduction of 
susrar to a syrup, which is done by adding water to 
sugar in the proportion of a pint and a-half of water to 
three and a-half pounds of sugar. When this boils up 
in the kettle we have simple syrup. A few more min- 
utes of boiling, reduces the water which holds the sugar 
in perfect solution. At this stage, if the syrup is al- 
lowed to cool, the candy crystallizes on the sides of the 
dish, and we have rock candy. If, instead of allowing 
it to cool at this point, we allow it to reach a higher de- 
gree of heat, we shall find, in putting a spoon into the 
syrup, when drawing it out a long thread of sugar., 
will follow the spoon. It is to this point that confec- 
tioners bring the syrup for the greater number of can- 
dies produced. The greatest skill is required on the 
part 6f the operator to push the boiling sugar to this 
point without allowing it to reach the caramel state, 
when it becomes bitter and dark and is no longer fit to 
use as a confection. The proportion of sugar and water 
for candy making 1;?ill be three and one-half pounds of i 
sugar to ane and one-half pints of water. To this add 
one teaspoon of cream of tartar, which will prevent the

tendency of the sugar to assume the granular condition. 
To test the candy, drop into cold water. When this 
becoi]^s at once hard and brittle the vessel should be at 
once removed from the fire. Flat sticks are formed by 
pouring the candy into long flat pahs, and when cooling 
crease the mass, which will readily break into sticks 
when cold. To make round stick candy, when cool 
enough to handle and while warm enough to mould, roll 
into sticks with the hands. To colour candies, take 
small portions of the candy while cooling, and colour, 

then put together in strips and twist slightly.

LEMON tiANDY. 

Put into a kettle three and one-half pounds of sugar, 
one and one-half pints of water, and one teaspoon of 
cream of tartar. Let it boil until it becomes brittle 
when dropped in cold water ; when sufficiently done take 
off the fire and pour in a shallow dish which has been 
greased with a little butter. When this has cooled so 
that it can be handled, add a teaspoon of tartaric acid 
and the same quantity of extract of lemon, and work 
them into the mass. The acid must be fine and free 
from lumps. Work this in until evenly distributed, and 
no more, as it will tend to destroy the transparency of 
the candy. This method may be used for preparing all 
other candies, as pine-apple, etc, using different 
flavours.

half pints of water ; dissolve in the water before putting 
with the sugar one-quarter of an ounce of fine white 
gum arable, and wheu added to the sugar put in one tea- 
spoon of cream of tartar. The candy should not be 
boiled quite to the brittle stage. The proper degree can 
be ascertained if, when a small skimmer is put in and 
taken out, when blowing through the holes of the skim- 
mer, the melted sugar is forced through in leathery 
filaments : remove from the fire at this point and rub the

Miss. Wyllie. 

Take one pound of treacle, the same quantity of moist

large enough to allow of fast boiling over a clear fire ; 
put in the butter first, and rub it well over the bottom 
of the saucepan, and add the treacle and sugar, stirring 
together gently with a knife; after it has boiled for 
about ten minutes ascertain if it is done by having 
ready a basin of cold water, and drop a little of the 
mixture into it from the point of a knife; if it is 
sufficiently done, when you take it from thfe water 
it will be quite crisp.' Now prepare a large, shallow tin 
pan or dish rubbed all over with butter to prevent its 
adhering, and into this pour the toffee from the sd.uce- 
pan to get it cold, when it can be easily removed

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING BREAD 



h. 



w 



I ! 



In the composition of good bread, there are three im- 
portant requisites : Good flour, good yeast, and strength 
to knead it well. Flour should be white and dry, crumb- 
ling easily again after it is pressed in the hand. 

A very good method of ascertaining the quality of 
yeast will be to add a little flour to a very small quan- 
tity, setting it in a warm place. If in the course of ten 
or fifteen minute it rises, it will do to use. 

When you make bread, first set the sponge with warm 
milk or watc , keeping it in a warm place until quite 
light. Then mould this sponge, by adding flour into 
one large loaf, kneading it well. Set this to rise again, 
and then when sufficiently light mould it into smaller 
loaves, let it rise again, then bake. Care should be 
taken not to get the dough too stiff with flour ; it should 
befts^oftas it ui>ii be to knead well To make bread

always be silted. 

YEAST. 

Mm. E. S. Ghoesdbrongh. 

Put two tablespoons of hops in a muslin bag and boil 
them in three quarts of water for a few minutes ; have 
ready a quart of hot mashed potatoes, put in one cup of 
flour, one tablespoon of sugar, one of salt ; pour over 
the mixture the boiling hop water, strain through a col- 
ander, put a pint or less of fresh baker's yeast, or two 
cakes of yeast in while it is warm, and set it in a warm 
place to rise. This yeast will keep three or four weeks, 
if set in a cool place. In making it from time to time, 
us^a bowl of the same to raise the fresh with. 

YEAST. 

Mn. Mary Ludlam. 

Six good potatoes grated raw, a little hop tea, one 
quart of boiling water, three-fourths cup of brown sugar^ 
one-half teaspoon of salt ; when cool, add yeast to rise i 
keep covered and in a cool plsrce. 

BEST BAKING POWDER. 

Mrs. Oliphant. 

Tartaric acid, four parts, by weight; bicarbonate 
soda, live parts, by weight ; baked flour, nine parts, by 
weight. The flour should be absolutely dry. The tar- 
taric acid and the soda n* t also be dry, and pulverized

To make one loaf : — Rye meal unsifted, half a pint ; 
Indian meal sifted, one pint ; sour milk, one pint ; mo- 
lasses, half a gill. Add a teaspoonful of salt, one tea- 
spoonful of soda dissolved in a little hot water; stir 
well, put in a greaesd pan, let it rise one hour, and 
steam four hours. • 

SALT RISING BREAD. 

Mrs. Upham. 

At supper time take one-fourth teaspoonful of salt, 
same of soda, and one teaspoonful of white sugar ; over 
this pour one teacupful of boiling water, and add one 
cupful of cold water ; stir in three dessertspoonfuls of 
Indian meal and flour enough to make a thick batter, 
and cover tightly. In cold weather place rt where it 
will be warm aU night. In the morning place your 
bowl in a dish of water as hot as you can hold your finger 
in. Stir it often and thoroughly for an hour. Sift in a 
ten quart pan two-thirds full of flour, into it stir enough 
warm water, one tablespoonful of salt, and one-half tea- 
spoonful soda, to make a thin batter; then stir your 
yeast in thoroughly and place in a warm place, where 
no draughts of cold air will reach it. Let it rise to ihQ 
top of pan.

the mixture thickens like starch ; add one teacup of 
sugar, one-half cup of salt ; when sufficiently cool, one. 
cup of good yeast. Let it stand until a thick foam rises 
upon the top. Care must be taken not to bottle too 
soon, or the bottles may burst. Use one coffee 6up of 
yeast to six loaves of bread. If kept in a cool place this 
yeast will last a long time, and housekeepers need not 
fear having sour bread.

GRAHAM BREAD. 

Mrs. H. P. Stowell. 

Set sponge of fine flour, same as for wheat bread ; 
when sufficiently raised, instead of mixing with fine flour, 
mix with Graham to the usual consistency ; mould with

I think it better without either.

To the quantity of light bread dough that you would 
take for twelve persons, add the white of one egg well 
beaten, two tablespoons gf white sugar, and two table-

out about half an inch thick ; cut the size required, and 
spread one with melted butter and lay another upon th«

mix aa for soda biscuit. Let it nse till morninp^. Roll 
in thin sheets, and cut into squares, spread a very little 
butter on each, and sprinkle a little flour on to roll up

manner : Put fresh water in a kettle over the fire to 
boil, and put in some salt ; when the water boils, stir in 
handful by handful corn or oatmeal until thick enough 
for use. In order to have excellent mush, the meal 
should be allowed to cook well, and long as possible 
while thin, and before|the final handful is added. When 
dosired to be fried for breakfast, turn into an earthen 
dish and set away to cool. Then cut in slices when you 
wish to fry ; dip each piece in beaten eggs and fry on a 
hot griddla, 

OATMEAL GRUEL. 

Take two tablespoons of oatmeal, pour on it a pint of 
cold water ; let it stand half a day, then pour it through

SUGGESTIONS. 

lu ma-tiug Cake, it is very desirable that the materials 
bo of the finest quality. Sweet, fresh butter, eggs and 
good flour are the first essentials. The process o'' put- 
ting together is also quite an important featuie, and 
where other methods are not driven in this work bv con- 
tributors, it would be well for the young housekeeper to 
observe the following direction : Never allow the butter 
to oil, but soften it by putting it in a moderately warm 
place before you commence other preparations for your 
cake ; then put it into an earthen dish (tin, if not new^ 
will discolour your cake as you stir it), and add your 
sugar ; beat the butter and sugar to a cream ; add the 
yolks of the eggs, then the milk, and lastly the beaten 
whites of the eggs and flour. Spices and liquors may 
be added after the yolks of the eggs are put in, and 
fruit should be put in with the flour. 

The oven should be pretty hot for small cakes, and 
moderate for larger. To ascertain if & large cake is suffi-

ciently baked, pierce it wifch a broom-straw through the 

centre ; if done, the straw will come out free from dough » 

if not done, dough will adhere to the straw. Take it out 

of the tin about fifteen minutes after it is taken from the 

oven (not sooner), and do not turn it over on the top to 

cool. 

ICING. 

The following lules should be observed where boiled 
icing is bot used : — 

Put the whites of your eggs in a shallow earthen dish, 
and allow, at least, a quarter of a pound or sixteen table- 
spoons of the finest white sugar for each egg. Take part 
of the sugar at first and sprinkle over the eggs ; beat them 
for about half an hour, stirring in gradually the rest of 
the sugar ; then add the flavour. If you use the juice of 
a l6mon, allow more sugar. Tartaric acid and lemon juice 
whitens icing. It may be shaded a pretty pink with 
strawberry juice or cranberry syrup, or coloured yellow 
by putting t..e juice and rind of a lemon in a thick muslin 
bag and squeezing it hard into the eggs and sugar. 

If cake is well dredged with flour after baking, and 
then carefully wiped before the icing is put op, it will 
not run and can be spread more smoothly. Put frosting 
on to the cake in large spoonsful, commencing over the 
centre ; then spread it over the cake, using a large knife, 
dipping it occasionally m cold water. Dry the frosting 
ju the cake in a cool, dry place. 

FROSTING.

One pint granulateJ sugar, moisten thoroughly with

water sufficient to dissolve it when heated ; let it boil 
until it Uireads from the spojn, stirring often j while the 
sugar is boiling, beat the whites of two eggs till they are 
firm ; then when thoroughly beaten, turn them into a 
deep dish, and when the sugar is boiled, turn it over the 
whites, beating all together rapidly until of the right con- 
sistency to spread over the cake. Flavour with lemon if 
preferred. This is sufficient for two loaves. 

FROSTING FOR CAKE. 

EUa Guild. 

One cup frosting sugar, two tablespoons of water boiled 
together ; take it off the stove and stir in the white of one 
egg beaten to a stiff froth ; stir all together well ; then 
frost your cake with it, and you will never want a nicer 
frosting than this. 

ICE CREAM ICING FOR WHITE CAKE. 

Mrs, P. B. Ayer. 

Two cups pulverized sugar boiled to a thick syrup ; 
add three teaspoons vanilla ; when cold, add the whites 
of two eggs well beaten, and flavoured with two teaspoons 
of citric acid.

thirds of a cup of butter and one and a-half cups of 
flour ; stir briskly for a moment, leaving it over the fire ; 
remove this mixture and place in a dish where it will 
get entirely cold ; beat five large frenh eggs very 
thoroughly, then stir in your cold mixture a spoonful at 
a time ; stir in all until smooth and free from lumps I 
drop them upon a greased dripping pan in small pear-

TEA. 

When the water in the tea-kettle begins to boil, have 
ready a tin tea^teeper ; pour into the tea-steeper just a 
very little of the boiling water, and then put in tea, allow- 
ing one teaspoon of tea to each person. Pour over this 
boiling water until the steeper is little more than half 
full ; cover tightly and let it stand where it will keep hot, 
but not boil. Let the tea infuse for ten or fifteen minutes, 
and then pour into the tea um, adding more boiling 
water, in the proportion of one cup of water for every tea- 
spoon of dry tea which has been infused. Have boiling 
water in a water pot, and weaken each cup of tea as 
desired. Do not use water for tea that has boiled long. 
Spring water is best for tea, and filtered water next best. 

TEA A LA RU^SE. 

Pare and slice fresh, juicy lemons ; lay a piece in the 
bottom of each cup, sprinkle with white sugar, and pour 
hot, strong tea over. Or the kuion may be sent around 
in slices with the peel on. No cream is used.

coffee ; put it in a porcelain bowl, sugar it properly and 
add to it an equal portion of boiled milk, or one-third 
the quantity of a rich cream. Surround the bowl with 
pounded ice. 

Roasting Coffee. — This process should be carefully 
watched and superintended. When the berry crackles 
and becomes crisp it is sufiiciently roasted. Once taken 
off the roaster, it should be placed in several Uiick folds 
of flannel, to preserve the oil and aroma. When cool, 
place it in an air-tight canuister.

MISCELLANEOUS. 



LIME WATER. 

MiB. £. 0. Lynd«. 

One of the most useful agents of household economy 
at njhtly understood, is lime water. Its mode of prepa- 
ratioa is ^d follows : Put a stone of fresh unslacked lime 
about the size of a half-peck measure into a large stone 
jar or unpainted pail, and pour over it slowly and care- 
fully, (so as not to slacken too rapidly,) a tea-kettle full 
(four gallons,) of Iiot water, and stir thoroughly ; let it 
settle, «nd then stir again two or three times in twenty- 
four hotira Then bottle carefully, all that can be poured 
off in a dear and limpid state. 

Uses. — It is often sold by druggists as a remedy for 
children's ^summer complaints, a teaspoon being a dose in 
a cup of milk, and when diarrhoea is caused, by acidity of 
the stomacli. it is an excellent remedy, and when put into 
milk gives no unpleasant taste, but rather improves tlie 
flavour. 

When put into milk that might curdle when heated, 
it will prevent its so doing, and can then be used for 
puddings and pies. A little stirred into cream or luilk^ 
after a hot day or night, will prevent its turning when 
used for tea or coflee. 

It is unequalled in cleai^ing bottles or sniail iuilk

A cupful, or even more, mixed in the sponge of bread 
or cakes made over night, will prevent it from souring. 

PRESERVING AUTUMN LEAVES. 

Mrs. 0. H. Wheeler. 

These may be easily preserved and retain their natural 
tints, or nearly so, by either of the following methods : 
As they are gathered they may be laid between the leaves 
of a magazine until the book is full, and left with a light 
weight upon them an till the moisture of the leaves has 
been absorbed ; two or three thicknesses of paper should 
intervene between the leaves. If the leaves are large or 
in clusters, take newspapers, lay them on a shelf and use 
in the same manner as above. Then dip the leaves into 
melted wax (such as is used for moulding fruits, etc.,) into 
which you will have to put a few drops of turpentine and 
lay upon newspapers to harden perfectly. This will make 
the leaves pliable and natural, and gives sufficient gloss. 
Great care should be taken that the wax is of right tem- 
perature. This can be ascertained by the fiist leaf which 
is dipped in. Draw out gently over the pan both sides of 
the leaf and hold it up by the stem. If the wax is too 
hot the leaf will shrivel — if too cool it will harden in 

lumps on the leaf. 
Another method is to iron each leaf with a middling 

hot iron until the moisture is all out of them. Are best 

without varnish. 

SKELETON LEAVES. 

Boil the leaves in equal parts of rain water and soft 
soap until you can separate the pulp from the skin i

VAl-UAm.E RECIPES. 



Son 



take them out into clear water; lay the leaf to bo clej^ned 
on glass, the upper aide of the leaf next to the glass ; 
then with a tooth brush remove all pulp and skin, turn 
the leaf and repeat the process ; when thoroughly done 
put the leaf to bleach in this solution : One pound sal 
soda, dissolved in five pints rain water ; one-half pound 
chloride of lime, in three pints water ; allow twenty-four 
hours for the lalter to dissolve. Strain out the sediment, 
-and pour out the clear solution of lime into the solution 
of sal soda. The result will be a thick butter-milk solu- 
tion, otherwise the lime was not strong enough. Filter 
this until it is perfectly clear. For leaves, use one part 
of solution to one part of water : for fern?, use the solu- 
tion full strength. When perfectly white, remove to clear 
water ; let stand for several hours, changing two or three 
times ; the last water should be a little ue ; float out on 
paper, press in books when nearly dry. In mounting use 
mucilage made of five parts of gum arabic, three parts 
white sugar, two parts of starch ; add a very little water, 
boil and stir until thick and white. 



TO RESTORE FROZEN PLANTS. 

As soon as discovered, pour cold water over the plant, 
wetting every leaf thoroughly. In a few moments it 
will be crystallised with a thick coating of ice. In this 
state place it in the dark, carefully covered with a news- 
paper. The ice will slowly melt, leaving the plant in its 
original state of health.

AN EXCELLENT HARD SOAP. 

Mrs. Kate Johnson. 

Pour twelve quarts soft boiling water on two and one- 
half pounds of unslacked lime ; dissolve five pounds sa] 
soda in twelve quarts soft hot water ; then mix and let 
them remain from twelve to twenty-four hours. Pour ofl 
all the clear fluid, being careful not to allow any of the 
sediment to run oflf ; boil three and one-half pounds clean 
grease and three or four ounces of resin in the above lye 
till the grease disappears ; pour into a box and let it stand 
a filay to stifien and then cut in bars. It is as well to put 
the lime in all the water and then add the soda. After 
pouring off the fluid, add two or three gallons of water 
and let it stand with the lime and soda dregs a day or two. 
This makes an excellent washing fluid to boil or soak the 
clothes in, with one pint to a boiler of water. 

CLEANING SILVER. 

Mrs. 0. L. Parker. 

Never put a particle of soap about your silver if you 
would have it retain its original lustre. When it wants 
polish, take a piece of soft leather and whiting and rub 
hard. The proprietor of one of the oldest silver estab- 
.lishments in the city of Philadelphia says that house- 
keepers ruin their silver in soap suds, as it makes it look 

like pewter.

STOVE POLISH. 

Mrs. O. L. Parker. 

Stove lustre, when mixed with turpentine and applied 
m the usual manner, is blacker, more glossy, and more 
durable than when mixed with any other liquid. The 
turpentine prevents rust, and when put on an old rusty 
stove wiU make it look as well as new. 






TO EXTRACT INK. 

To extract ink from cotton, silk, and woollen goods, 
saturate the spot with spirits of turpentine, and let it 
remain several hours ; then rub it between the hands. 
It will crumble away without injuring either the colour 
or texture of the article. 



TO TAKE INK OUT OF LINEN. 

Dip the spotted part in pure tallow, melted ; then wash 
out the tallow and the ink will disappear.

portion of soap put into a little hot water, and a flannel 
cloth will save hard labour ; and a brush in cleaning 
paint. One who has tried it thinks it worth the price of the 
book. 

FOR BLEACHING COTTON CLOTH. 

Mrs. C. H. Wheeler. 

One pound chloride of lime, dissolved and strained ; 
put in two or three pails of water ; thoroughly wet tlie 
cloth and leave it in over night ; then rinse well in two 
waters. This will also take out mildew, and is equally- 
good for brown cotton or white that has become yellow 
from any cause, and will not injure the fabric 

TO REMOVE TAR. 

Rub well with clean lard, afterwards wash with soap 
and warm water. Apply this to either hands or clothing. 

JAVELLE WATER FOR MILDEW STAINS. 

One pound of chloride of lime, two of washing soda, 
two gallons of soft water ; pour one gallon of boiling 
.water to the ingredients to dissolve them, adding the cold 
water when dissolved.

Mrs. S. I. Parker. 

Blue. — For five pounds of cloth, take five ounces of 
copperas, with two pails of water in a tin or copper 
boiler ; set it over the fire till the copperas is dissolved 
and it begins to heat, then put in the cloth, stirring it 
frequently till it boils, one-half or three-fourths of an

hour ; then rerr^ove the cloth where it can drain ; pour 
away the copperas water and take two ounces of prus- 
siate of potash in about two pails of water in the same 
vessel ; when it is well dissolved and hot, put in the cloth 
from the copperas water, stirring it thoroughly till ii 
boils, one-half an hour, then remove the cloth ; add (with 
care and caution, on account of the spattering which 
ensues,) one tablespoon of oil of vitriol, and stir it well in 
the dye ; replace the cloth, stirring it briskly till it has 
boiled one-half an hour. Should*, be well rinsed and 
washed in clear water Xo prevent the dye from making it 
tender after colouring. ^ 

Yellow. — For five pounds of cloth, dissolve one-half 
pound of sugar of lead in a tub of warm water and 
twelve ounces of bichromate of potash in another tub of 
cold water ; soak, rinse, and wring the cloth in the lead 
water first, then in the other, and from one to the otheii 
till the right shade of colour is obtained. 

Orange. — Dip the yellow coloured cloth into strong 
lime water ; if it should not turn, boil it ; rinse all well. 

Green. — Put your blue cloth in the yellow dye in the 
same manner as for colouring yellow. Old calico will 
take a darker shade of blue or green in the same dye 
with the white cloth.

Grease from Cloth. — Grease can be removed from 
cloth by a paste of Fuller's earth and turpentine. This 
should be rubbed on the fabric until the turpentine has 
evaporated and a white powder produced. The latter can 
be brushed off, and the grease will have disappeared. 

To Mend China. — Take very thick solution of gum 
arable in water, and gtir into ^ plaster of Paris until the 
mixture becomes of a proper consistency. Apply it with 
a brush to the fractured edges of the china, and stick 
them together. In three days the articles cannot be

renders it doubly valuable. 

How TO Cure a Bone Felon. — Of all painful things

avS this malady is quite frequent and the subject of much 
eajiiest consideration, we give the latest recipe for its 
cure, which is given by that high authority, the London 
Lancet : — *' As soon as the pulsation which indicates the 
disease is felt, put directly over the spot a fly blister, 
a bout the size of your thumb nail, and let it remain for 
eii hours, at the expiration of which time, directly under 
the surface of the blister, may be seen the felon, which 
can be instantly taken out with the point of a needle or 
A lanoet."

How TO GET RID OF Flies. — A clergyman, writinf^ frow 
Ireland says : — " For three years I have lived in towa 
and during that time ray sitting room has been fre« 
from flies, three or four only walking about my break- 
fast table, while all my neighbours* rooms were crowded, 
I often congratulated myself on my escape, but never 
knew the reason of it until two days ago. I then had 
occassion to move my goods to another house, while 1 
remained on for two days longer. Among other things 
moved were two boxes of geraniums and calceolarias, 
which stood in my window, the latter always being open 
to its full extent top and bottom. The boxes were not 
gone half an hour before my room W3.s as full of flies 
as those around me. This, to me, is a new discovery, 
and perhaps it may serve to encourage others in that 
which is always a source of [»leasure, and which now 
proves also to be a source of comfort, viz., window 
iirdening."

Smallpox Remedy. — The following remedy a friend 
tried in Ohio in a case of confluent smallpox, when the 
doctor had little hope of saving the patient, and it saved 
the woman's life. The remedy is sure in scarlet fever. 
"I herewith append a recipe which has been used to 
my own knowledge in a hundred cases. It will prevent 
or cure the smallpox, even though the pittings are 
filling. When Jenner discovered cow-pox in England, 
the world of science hurled an avalanche of fame upon 
his head, and w^hen the most scientific school of medi- 
cine in the world (that of Paris), published this panacea 
lor the smallpox it passed unheeded. It is unfailing

as fate, and conquers in every instance. It i^ harm loss 
when taken by a well person. It will also cure scarlet 
fever. Take sulphate of zinc, one grain ; fox glove 
(digitalia), one grain ; half a teaspoon of water. When 
thoroughly mixed, add four ounces water. Take a 
spoonful every hour, and either disease will disappear 
in twelve hours. For a child, smaller doses, aceordirig 
to age." 

For Hydrophobia. — Franklin Dyer, a highly respec- 
table farmer of Galena, Kent County, Md., gives the 
following as a sure cure for the bite of a mad dog. He 
has tested it with most gratif^dng results : Elecampane 
is a plant well known and found in many gardens. Im- 
mediately after being bitten, take one and a-half ounces 
of the root of the plant, the green root is preferable. 
The dried, to be found in drug stores, will answer ; 
bruise it, put it in a pint of fresh milk, boil down to half 
a pint, strain, and when cold drink it, fasting at least 
six hours afterwards. The next morning repeat the 
dose, fasting, using two ounces of the root. On the 
third morning, take another dose prepared as the last, 
and this will be sufficient. After each dose, notliinor to 
b« «aten for at least six hours. I had a son who was 
Ditten by a mad dog eighteen years ago, and four other 
children in the neighbourhood were also bitten. They 
took the above, and are now alive and well. I have 
known many who were cured. It is supposed that the 
fOot contains a principle, which, being taken up by the

much confidence in this simple remedy that I am willing? 
you should give my name ' in connection with this 
state fn en t. 

For Felon. — Take common rock salt, as used for Halt- 
ing down pork or beef, dry in an oven, then pound it 
fine and mix with spirits of turpentine in equal .parts ; 
put it IK a rag and wrap it around the parts affected ; 
as it gets dry put on more, and in twenty-four hours you 
are cured. The felan will be dead. No harm to try it, 
as I have with success. 

Cure for Neuralgia. — A friend who suffered horrible 
pains from neuralgia, hearing of a noted physician in 
Germany who invariably cured the disease, went to him, 
and was permanently cured after a short sojourn. The 
doctor gave him the remedy, which was nothing but a 
poultice and tea made from our common field thistle. The 
leaves aie macerated and used as a poultice on the parts 
affected, while a small quantity of the same is boiled down 
to the pi oportion oi a quart to a pint, and a small wine 
"lass of (he decoction drank before each meal. Our friend 

V 

says he has never known it to fail in giving relief, while 
in almost every case it has effected a cure. God gave 
herbs for Che healing of the nations. 

Tincture op Iodine on Corns. — Dr. Bnjis states that 
corns may be rapidly cured by the application of the 
Tincture of Iodine ; the corn disappearing in the course 
of a few days, if touched with the Tincture several times 
a day. If the com be situated between the toes, it should 
be covered with a piece of linen steeped in a mixture of 
the Tincture and Glycerine.— Mrs. C. Patterson. 



VALUABLE RECIPES.

Flannels for Fomentation. — Fold the flannel the 
size to fit over a pot of boiling water, and cover with a 
lid ; in a few minutes it will be hotter than if wrung out 
of boiling water and yet dry at the corners ; roll it up 
covered, and convey quickly to the patient. — J. K. 

GiLMOUR. 

For Hoarseness. — Squeeze the juice of half a lemon 
in a pint bowl, add loaf sugar (two tablespoons), one full 
teaspoon of glycerine, and one full tablespoon of whiskey ; 
pour over this boiling hot water to nearly fill the bow!, 
and drink hot just before going to bed. 

For Sore Throat. — Cut slices of salt pork or fat 
bacon ; simmer a few moments in hot vinegar, and apply 
to throat as hot as possible. When this is taken off, aa 
the throat is relieved, put around a bandaga of soft flannel. 
A gargle of equal parts of borax and alum, dissolved in 
water, is also excellent. To be used frequently. 

Healing Lotion. — One ounce glycerine, one ounce rose- 
water, ten drops carbolic acid. This preparation prevents 
and cures chapping of the skin, and at the same time 
bleaches it. It is also excellent for sore lips and gumc. 1^ 
consider it an indispensable adjunct to the toilet table. — 
Mrs. a, Yocum. 

To STOP Bleeding. — A haniiful of flour bound on the 
cut. — Mrs. A. M. 

To Prevent Contagion from Eruptive Diseases. — 
Keep constantly, in plates or saucers, sliced raw onions 
in the sick room, if possible. As fast as they become

of sl^in diseases that are eruptive, onions, except those 
taken fresh from the earth, are unsafe, as they are pecu- 
liarly sensitive to disease. 

To Restoke from. Stroke of LioHTNJNO.-rShower 
with cold water for two hours ; if the patient does not 
show signs of life, put salt in the water, and continue to 
shower an hour longer. 

For Toothache. — Of powdered alum and fine salt, 
equal quantities ; apply to the tooth and it will give 
speedy relief. — Mrs. Bartlett. 

"For Headache. — Pcmr a few drops of ether on one. 
half ounce of gum camphor and pulverize ; add to thiu 
an equa) quantity of corbonate ammonia pulverized ; 
add twenty drops peppermint ; mix and put in an open- 
mouthed bottle and cork. — Mrs. A. M. Gibbs. 

Salve for Chilblains. — Fry out nicely a little mutton 
tallow ; into this, while melted, and after it is nicely 
strained, put an equal quantity of coal oil ; stir well 
together while it is cooling. 

To Remove Discolouration fbom Bruises. — Apply 
a cloth wrung o\it in very hot water, and renew frequently 
until the pain ceasea Or, apply raw beefsteak. 

Cure for Wasp Sting. — Apply a poultice of saleratua 
water and flour, and bind on the sting. Apply slices of 
raw onion for a bee sting. 

CuR|! FOR Summer Complaint. — Two ounces tincture 
rhubarb, one of paregoric, one-haif *^^' essence of pepper-

mint, one-half of essence of annis, one-half of prepared 
chalk. Dose for adult, one teaspoon in a little water ; 
take as often as needed. — Mrs. L. Bradley. 

The best Deodorizer, — Use bromo-chlonilum in ^he 
proportion of one tablespoon to eight of soft water ; dip 
cloths m this solution and hang in the rooms ; it will 
purify sick rooms of any foul smells. The surface of 
anything may be purified by washing well and then rub- 
bing over with a weakened solution of bromo-chloralum. 
A weak solution is excellent to rinse the mouth* with" 
often, when from any cause the breath is otlensive. It 
is also an excellent wash for sores and wounds that have 
an oifensive odour. 



To Destroy Bed Bugs. Moths, and Other Vermin. 
— Dissolve alum in hot water, making a very strong 
solution ; apply to furniture or crevices in the walls with 
paint brush. This is sure destruction to those noxious 
vermin, and invaluable because easily obtained, is perfect- 
ly safe to use, and leaves no unpleasant traces behind. 
When you suspect^ iiioths have lodged in the borders of 
carpets, wet the edges of the carpets with a strong 
solution ; whenever it reaches them, it is certain death.

How TO Select Meats. — An English journal gives 
the following hints on this subject : — " Good and whole- 
some meat should be neither of a pale rosy or pink 
colour, nor of a deep purple. The first denotes the 
diseased condition, the last proves the animal has died 
a natural death. Gbod meat has more of a marble look)

in consequence of the branching of the veins which siir- 
round the adipose cells. The fat, especially of the inner 
organs, is alway firm and suofcy, and never moist, while 
in general the fat from diseased cattle is flabby and 
watery, and more often resembles jelly or boiled parch- 
ment. Wholesome meat will always show itself firm and 
elastic to the touch, and exhibit no dampness, while 
diseased moat will appear soft and moist, in fact often 
more wet, so that the liquid substances run out of the 
blood when pressed hard. Good meat has very little 
.«mell, while unsound meat has a disagreeable, cadaver- 
ous smell, and diffuses a certain medicinal odour. This 
can be distinctly proved by cutting the meat through 
♦ with a knife and smelling the blade, or pouring warm 
water over it. Lastly, bad meat has the peculiarity that 
it shrinks considerably in the boiling : whokome meat 
rather swells, and does not lose an ounce im weight"
